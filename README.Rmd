  fig.path = "output/README_figs/"
)
```


# To Do:
  - blogpost in Rmarkdown and Pictures included
  - Model Fitting:
  
## Data Cleaning:
```{r cleaning, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# run script
source("./scripts/data_cleaning.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# Note: E031-2,E035-2,E082,E113-1,E113-2 have been run once through
# error fixing* with Subtitle editor** in Ubuntu 20.04. This is needed as
# the files contain formatting errors, which renders them unusable for the 
# following analysis. 
# The original files are included in the same folder and are named as follows:
# 'original_C1E031-1_FINAL.srt'
# * Tools -> Error checking -> Error -> Try to fix all 
# ** (install via 'sudo apt install subtitleeditor' on ubuntu)
```  

## Create Data for Visualization
```{r descriptive_analysis, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# run script
source("./scripts/data_descriptive_analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```  

## Descriptive Analysis:
```{r descriptive_analysis, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# run script
source("./scripts/descriptive_analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```  

## Machine Learning:
```{r descriptive_analysis, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# run script
source("./scripts/machine_learning.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```  

Visualisation:
  - tf_df
  - normalize sentiment
  - everything in one data frame for actors
  - check if time in MS or SEC
  - questions: where is episode 115? Where is arc "End"?
  - check episode numbers(12 = not 12 as this is dungeon master tips?)


Models to tune:
  - For accuracy:
      - Kernel SVM
      - random forest
      - gradient boost
      - neural network
  - for speed
      - decision tree
      - naive Bayes
      - linear SVM
      - knn
  - for completion
      - lasso etc.
