00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,646
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons, roll dice, and stuff.

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:16,902
Tonight is a special episode; it's a special 50th
episode. We've made 50 of these! To kick off the

4
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:22,716
evening's festivities before the game, we want to
show our first big present to you guys, something

5
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:27,782
we've been working on for about a little over a
month. We hope you guys enjoy it. Let's go ahead

6
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:33,005
and have a look at the new full intro for Critical
Role.

7
00:00:33,005 --> 00:02:02,772
[dramatic music]

8
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,386
MATT: And welcome back, guys!

9
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:09,698
(cheering)

10
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:19,068
MATT: That was fun! We've been silently working on
that for a long time.

11
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,097
MARISHA: It was so hard to keep secret.

12
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:27,461
MATT: I know. Every edit that came in was awesome.
Yeah, we all went together in Simi Valley for a

13
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:33,972
day and shot, and did wonderful photos, which we
actually have wallpaper going up tonight!

14
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:37,003
LAURA: That is correct. It'll be going up very
soon.

15
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,526
MARISHA: I guess I could go right--

16
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,488
LAURA: Do it now, he just said it!

17
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:45,432
LIAM: We're doing it live! We're doing it live.

18
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:50,488
SAM: We're releasing a special 50th episode
wallpaper all for you guys to use on your home PCs.

19
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:53,521
MARISHA: On the Critical Role Twitter and Facebook

20
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,704
SAM: Download it!

21
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:55,726
MATT: There you go.

22
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,346
MARISHA: Download it, @criticalrole.

23
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:58,679
LIAM: Good, pressure's off.

24
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,759
MARISHA: It's done.

25
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,065
MATT: It's all over. Episode's over. No, thank you
guys for coming tonight. Hope you enjoyed that. We

26
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:07,415
have some really awesome people that helped out
with that. I'm going to go ahead and get some

27
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:12,999
thank-yous here. We have, first off, a big thank
you to Jan-Michael Losada, our DP for that shoot; Pamela

28
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:20,091
Joy who did all the incredible photography, and
Loretta Richert, both of them helped us find and secure

29
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:24,061
the location and shot an incredible series of
photos that we'll be using in upcoming episode

30
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:27,733
releases and promotional stuff! So check that out.
You guys have been amazing, thank you so much.

31
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:33,956
Next up, I want to go ahead and thank Dave and
James Codeglia who are from Ghostlight. They did

32
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:39,048
all the special effects you see as well as the
color grading and the editing. They did a

33
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:44,841
phenomenal job on this, and big thanks to you
guys. It's far more than I ever expected it could

34
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,475
be. Ghostlight is awesome.

35
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,109
TRAVIS: Are we cutting to that title camera so
they can see the addresses?

36
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:57,411
MATT: Yeah. For makeup we want to thank Misti
Dawn, Talor Bianca Appice, and Heather Galipo,

37
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:01,620
they did an amazing job. And Travis, of course,
for sitting in the makeup chair for a long time.

38
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,345
TRAVIS: It was cold (laughs). It was real cold.

39
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:11,201
MARISHA: Four hours! Specifically, Misti did a lot
of our beauty makeup, Bianca did Travis, and

40
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,785
Heather did all of our ears. Because ears take a
lot of time!

41
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:23,717
MATT: You guys did an amazing job. Next up, for
our illustrious costumers, we have Jessica Dru,

42
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:29,695
who did an amazing job, Jessica Dru Johnson for
selling me the costumes, Vanessa Walton, who made

43
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:32,038
your wonderful headpiece--

44
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,781
MARISHA: Yes, and she has an Etsy store, actually:
Creature of Habit on Etsy. So follow her on

45
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,155
Instagram and of course you can go-- she makes all
these amazing flower crowns; she's basically a

46
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,334
real-life faerie.

47
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,141
TALIESIN: It's a magical Instagram.

48
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,362
MARISHA: It is a magical Instagram, Creature of
Habit.

49
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:52,281
MATT: Check that out. And of course Bryan Forrest
for both applying a lot of the armor to Pike and a lot

50
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:56,558
of individuals here. He brought a lot of the great
costume pieces and armor, and was one of our

51
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:01,492
illustrious goblins; he got killed as two
different goblins! Took two arrows, one in the

52
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:05,690
face, one in the chest. A great stuntman, Bryan,
thank you so much for helping out with that.

53
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,725
MARISHA: Thank you Bryan, we love you!

54
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:12,489
MATT: Jon Enge who was our special effects
supervisor on set and was the goblin who got

55
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:15,331
stabbed in the back. He was amazing.

56
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:20,392
MARISHA: And he's got a youtube channel, Mars
Rising, which is great. And I did a Splinter Cell

57
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:24,175
guards sketch that I did with him a while ago

58
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:27,060
TALIESIN: He and I used to perform at the Ren
Faire together, it was a thing.

59
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,514
MARISHA: Oh! That's awesome; Jon's awesome. Go
check his stuff out.

60
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:31,765
LIAM: You worked at Ren Faire?

61
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,519
TALIESIN: Oh, shut up. Suck it.

62
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,753
TRAVIS: Lord Taliesin!

63
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:42,451
MATT: Of course, Jason Charles Miller, who's a
friend of the show, who's been on the show as

64
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:49,089
Garthok the half-orc rogue, did the new theme, as
well as the old one, but he re-upped for the new

65
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:54,416
theme, extending it and making it that much more
epic. Thank you so much. And Geoff Bisente did a

66
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,170
lot of the sound design on it as well. You guys
kicked ass on making it sound as good as it did.

67
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,166
Check out their stuff, they're amazing. I think
Jason should have the actual new song up on iTunes

68
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:07,125
soon in case you want it for a ringtone or
something. And last but certainly not least, we

69
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,980
have Avery Faeth, who did the amazing Percy
costume.

70
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,482
TALIESIN: My coat! She's an amazing coat designer.
She's got a--

71
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:16,281
MARISHA: She's a coat designer.

72
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:20,502
TALIESIN: She did the coat, she's an amazing
cosplayer and costume designer and you can find

73
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,538
her on Sickhorse all over the place.

74
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:27,772
MATT: And Kai Norman, who you've seen on the show,
he actually did our casts of the K'Varn horn, and

75
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:33,563
his incredible work. He did Percy's gun. He did a
number of the props we used for it, he's great. You

76
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:38,185
can find him at @KommissarProps. Additional
costuming done by Anne Valiant, who did an amazing

77
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:42,321
job helping us out getting the costume pieces we
needed for it. As well, a big shout-out to

78
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:45,642
Labyrinth of Jared at Masquerade Ball who also
helped provide a lot of the costumes for the

79
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:50,748
shoot, and Sword and the Stone who helped provide
a lot of the weaponry and armor, along with Bryan.

80
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:55,597
So thank you guys, all of you so much, for helping make
this happen. We're really excited and we hope you

81
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:56,548
liked it!

82
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:00,525
TRAVIS: Can you put the first one up again,
because we didn't get the Pamela Joy title-- yeah.

83
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:06,437
It's the only one we missed. They were so
instrumental and did such a lovely job.

84
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,484
LAURA: Yeah they did!

85
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:11,352
MARISHA: And Pam did the photo of the wallpaper.

86
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:15,458
LAURA: She's actually shot all of our photos from
the very beginning. She's freaking amazing.

87
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,647
TRAVIS: We have so much, you guys, so much.

88
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,176
MARISHA: Go follow her on Instagram! She's great.

89
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:25,678
MATT: All right. So getting into our actual
announcements here, try and cruise through this as

90
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,201
fast as possible.

91
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,388
SAM: It's our special episode; I thought everyone
was dressing up.

92
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,970
LAURA: We're all wearing our shirts

93
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,808
MARISHA: You're appropriate for Scanlan.

94
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,012
SAM: You all look like shit!

95
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,942
LIAM: Sam, can I show you my snake?

96
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:42,747
(oohing and aahing)

97
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,431
TRAVIS: Bigger than I thought it'd be!

98
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:49,749
MATT: Strangely, he lost it for a few sessions.

99
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:53,073
LIAM: This too shall pass.

100
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,702
MATT: All right, so: 50th episode, guys!

101
00:07:57,702 --> 00:07:59,848
(cheering)

102
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:04,780
MATT: Can't believe we made it this far! And more
to come. 50 more! Hopefully.

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,810
LIAM: Hey look! Ashley's here!

104
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:14,123
ASHLEY: Hey! I just landed. Not landed in a plane,
but just drove in.

105
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,390
MATT: Drove all across the country, from New
York.

106
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,932
ASHLEY: From, yes. Drove in from New York.

107
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,564
LAURA: So what does that mean, Ashley?

108
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,756
ASHLEY: I'm here for a little while.

109
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:26,162
(cheering)

110
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,279
MARISHA: She's back!

111
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,754
ASHLEY: I'm back for a little bit.

112
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,086
TRAVIS: Yay, Pike!

113
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:35,892
ASHLEY: Probably for a couple months, a few
months, we'll see. We're pushing it for a few

114
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,440
months.

115
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
MARISHA: That sounds better.

116
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,349
ASHLEY: I'm excited and I'm nervous, but I'm
excited.

117
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,436
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.

118
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:49,096
MATT: I'm so glad you could join us, and welcome
back, Ashley.

119
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,221
ASHLEY: Thanks. Thank you.

120
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:57,944
MATT: Also tonight we're putting up for the next
two weeks on pre-order a brand new set of "How Do

121
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,864
You Want To Do This" hoodies, which I'm wearing
here.

122
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:05,700
LAURA: It's Alternative Apparel and it's
super-duper-super-duper cozy inside.

123
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,633
TRAVIS: Look at that! Look at that.

124
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,370
ASHLEY: That's so softy-puffy.

125
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,203
MARISHA: They're super soft.

126
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:13,588
LAURA: You could use it as a pillow, you could use it
as a hoodie.

127
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,105
ASHLEY: You could wear it on a plane.

128
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:18,127
SAM: Where are all the other places they could
wear it?

129
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,136
ASHLEY: On a train.

130
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,764
LAURA: Dinner, you could wear it to dinner.

131
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:23,416
TALIESIN: You could wear it in a boat!

132
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,631
SAM: With a goat?

133
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,318
TALIESIN: You could put it on a goat.

134
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,123
MARISHA: To Big Lots.

135
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:31,340
TALIESIN: At work or on the go.

136
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,085
LIAM: Keep this going all night long.

137
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,384
MATT: Two hours.

138
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,511
SAM: It's this content that you've demanded.

139
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,200
(laughter)

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,087
MATT: So yeah, these are up on the store, or
should be, and will be up for pre-order for the next two

141
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:48,418
weeks. If you want one, get one! Because they're
cool. I like them.

142
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,259
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all have one.

143
00:09:50,259 --> 00:10:02,992
MATT: Indeed. All right, next up, Critmas is
tonight. So we got that coming up after the show.

144
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:05,459
LAURA: Just a few packages.

145
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,759
MARISHA: Yeah, just a few cartloads

146
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,784
MATT: We're going to do our best to keep it as
organized and as expedient as possible so we can

147
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:16,771
get to bed at a decent hour, especially those of
us who have like 8:00am call times in the morning.

148
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,560
Travis.

149
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,051
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay as long as I can.

150
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:28,751
MATT: (laughs) But yeah, so stick around for that.
You get to watch us all cry forever, because that's

151
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,009
what happens every time.

152
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,590
TRAVIS: Cry forever.

153
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,441
MATT: A couple other announcements: has here on
the list "posters."

154
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:39,474
TRAVIS, LIAM, and SAM: Posters?

155
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,186
MATT: Posters. Somebody must've put that on the
list.

156
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,398
LIAM: Maybe later.

157
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:44,767
SAM: What's a poster?

158
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,406
LIAM: There's four of them on a bed.

159
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:47,629
MATT: There you go, that makes sense.

160
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,638
TALIESIN: If somebody says they're one thing but
really they're just not all that.

161
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:55,314
MATT: That makes sense. Quick announcement, an
event coming up: a convention on May 26 to 29 in

162
00:10:55,314 --> 00:11:01,517
Atlanta called MomoCon. I will be a guest at that,
so all you east coast folks around Atlanta come

163
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:07,177
say hello! I have panels, and talks, and
autographs to give, and cool artwork you can pick

164
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:15,189
up. So yeah, MomoCon, May 26-29, hope to see you
guys there. Me and Marisha are both announced to

165
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:23,481
be guests at the Haven Expo in Mackay, Australia
on July 2nd, so all you folks in the outback,

166
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,684
you'll want to come hang out with me and Marisha
at the beginning of July.

167
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:28,385
ASHLEY: (Australian accent) In the outback!

168
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,838
MATT: Just like that.

169
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:32,810
ASHLEY: (accented) Going to get a bloomin' onion?

170
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,241
MATT: I'm so sorry.

171
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:37,194
LAURA: I'm sure they're really thrilled about
that.

172
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,597
MATT: She's back for ten minutes, guys.

173
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,033
ASHLEY: I know a lot of Australians.

174
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,114
SAM: You've already offended an entire continent.

175
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:48,315
MATT: You and Johnny Depp in the same week, come
on. So yeah, hopefully we're looking forward to

176
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:54,156
seeing a bunch of you guys down under at the
beginning of July. Let's see, reveal secret

177
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:59,478
Scientology message and ascend to Xenu, that's on
the list. We got that one situated.

178
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,731
TALIESIN: Who put this one together?

179
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:08,238
MATT: Rat Queens! The next Rat Queens issue coming
up. 16, I guess? Issue 16 is the number? Has a

180
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:13,286
series of pages in which all of Vox Machina have a
wonderful cameo.

181
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:18,116
SAM: It's amazing. We're in a comic book. We did
it.

182
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,862
TALIESIN: Has that not publicly been seen yet, is
that not out yet?

183
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,084
SAM: Some pictures have been, but not all of it.

184
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,727
MARISHA: We have transcended, you guys.

185
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,895
TALIESIN: We are fiction now.

186
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,740
ASHLEY: That's so crazy.

187
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:40,344
MATT: Yeah. Isn't it? One more thing I want to
mention: a really great game called Masquerada; I

188
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:45,006
play the lead character, Cicero Gavar. It's been
developed by a great studio named Witching Hour.

189
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:49,207
They put up a Kickstarter today to see if they can
make the game as good as it possibly can be-- that

190
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:53,421
final push. As an independent/indie studio and an
indie product, they're putting out a phenomenal

191
00:12:53,421 --> 00:13:00,209
isometric RPG. Great voice talent that includes
Jennifer Hale, Dave Fennoy, it's a great cast.

192
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,647
Check it out on Kickstarter if it's something you
think you'd be interested in, and possibly helping

193
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:08,217
them polish it and make it phenomenal. So check
that out. Anything else you guys want to

194
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,219
announce?

195
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,285
LIAM: Yeah! Can I get a CritRole?

196
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:14,532
ALL: CritRole!

197
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:19,643
LIAM: Boy, I always love sitting at the table with
my dice and having a nice cozy wooden box to keep

198
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:27,213
my dice in. Wyrmwood Gaming makes all kinds of
wooden boxes to hold your dice in. We have them

199
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,646
here, we have all kinds. There's these, there's
these-- they hold dice!

200
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,880
SAM: Those seem really remarkable, Liam.

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,190
ASHLEY: Wait, what is this one?

202
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,465
SAM: Is there anything any bigger?

203
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,825
LIAM: In due time.

204
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:42,513
LIAM: Wyrmwood Gaming, you know them already
because we talk about them non-stop, friend of the

205
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:48,136
show. If you use the code CritRole, you'll get
free shipping. Also Wyrmwood Gaming has a

206
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:53,326
kickstarter up this month for their Sentinel box,
which holds--

207
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:54,961
ALL: Ooh!

208
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,462
ASHLEY: What is this?

209
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,051
LIAM: It holds your cards, it holds your dice,
there's a bluetooth doohickey in it so you'll

210
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:04,881
never lose your box with dice and cards. And you
can get all kinds of woods, there's all kinds of

211
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:11,163
tiers, you can get the Critical Role logo etched
into any kind of box that they have. And if you

212
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:16,772
want to go full wizard you can get the shnazzy
Masterworks box, did I get that right?

213
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,665
LAURA: It is masterworks.

214
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:21,081
ASHLEY: I want that one!

215
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,803
TRAVIS: I think that's one of the Vestiges.

216
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:30,156
LIAM: So, check it out. Wyrmwood Gaming, they got
a Kickstarter, they got a website. They're our

217
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,757
good buddies.

218
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:35,757
MATT: All right. So, anything else anyone wants to
talk about or mention?

219
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,142
MARISHA: I mean.

220
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,526
MATT: Because if not, I think we may have to watch
that intro again.

221
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,241
(cheering)

222
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,877
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, do it again! Do that shit
again, please!

223
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,268
MATT: Let's watch that intro again.

224
00:14:45,268 --> 00:16:14,484
[dramatic music]

225
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:20,929
MATT: And welcome back. I remember writing the
script for that and going, "We're going to have to

226
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:24,287
cut all this." And then we didn't. I'm so happy
how it turned out.

227
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,046
MARISHA: Mainly because we ran out of time.

228
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:27,770
MATT: Like, "Well, we got to do it. Make it
work."

229
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,975
TALIESIN: "There's no time to do anything else,
other than this."

230
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:36,943
MATT: "We can't cut the tentacle creature. I don't
know how we'll do it, but it's in there." Let's go

231
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:44,401
ahead and bring us back into the realm of Exandria
and catch us up to what happened last time. Vox

232
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:49,788
Machina, a group of adventurers currently on the
path to try and usurp and destroy the Chroma

233
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:54,983
Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that
have torn through Tal'Dorei and currently reign

234
00:16:54,983 --> 00:17:01,105
supreme over the partially ruined cities that dot
the landscape. The largest of them, and apparently

235
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:11,794
the leader, Thordak the Cinder King sitting in the
main city of Emon, forcing you guys to flee.

236
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:17,846
You've gone about and discovered these artifacts,
these legendary items known as the Vestiges of

237
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:26,175
Divergence. Ancient magical weapons and equipment
from the last great war, the Divergence. And these

238
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:34,016
seem to be a key in which you can ascertain a
level of power and a means of destroying these

239
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:38,982
creatures. Upon seeking information about these,
you traveled south to the Frostweald, where you

240
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:45,989
battled a camp of orcs, freeing survivors from
Westruun's attack, and managed to walk your way

241
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:53,688
into the deep den of a forgotten Ioun temple where
Osysa, the sphinx's mate, resides. After

242
00:17:53,688 --> 00:18:01,384
traversing past traps and puzzles you made your
way to the main chamber in which the nameless

243
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:07,897
sphinx demanded you reveal that you have earned
its name. During this battle you traveled through

244
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:12,945
portals to other elemental realms to seek out the
information to hopefully devise the title of this

245
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:21,642
sphinx before it was too late. During which, Grog
leapt through, if I recall, one of these portals

246
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:26,720
into the Elemental Plane of Air. Set adrift
without a means of returning, he took his Chain of

247
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,615
Returning, attached it to Craven Edge, and threw
it through the portal. It found purchase and you

248
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:37,772
pulled yourself through, face-to-face with Pike,
with the blade embedded in her abdomen. The

249
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:43,288
weapon, which had achieved its maximum strength
potential of devouring the essence of others,

250
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:51,425
transformed during this battle and has been in its
rather intense and dangerous form since. You guys

251
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:58,204
managed to piece together the name of this sphinx,
at which point the battle ended and it presented

252
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:02,955
to you the information you required. It gave you the
information of the Vestiges that still exist, to

253
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:10,762
its knowledge, and you were escorted via immediate
sandstorm out of the temple and now stand at the

254
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:18,882
edge of the Stormcrest Mountains and the
Frostweald Forest itself. So. You all take a

255
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:26,245
moment to gather your thoughts, think over what
just transpired, and think on your next course of

256
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,594
action.

257
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:32,750
LAURA: Well, I want that bow. (laughs)

258
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,281
MARISHA: I heard a few things that seemed very
desireable.

259
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:40,672
LIAM: How is Pike?

260
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,124
SAM: Yeah, Pike, are you alive?

261
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:44,791
ASHLEY: I-- yes.

262
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,941
(laughter)

263
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,427
LAURA: He healed us all up before we left, right?

264
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:52,893
ASHLEY: He healed us. Yes, I'm fine! I'm fine.

265
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:57,130
MATT: Well, not completely, you guys healed from a
couple of spells that were cast at the time, but

266
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,421
you haven't had a rest.

267
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,586
MARISHA: But some of us are still older, right?

268
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,496
MATT: Indeed.

269
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,223
LIAM: Is your stomach closed?

270
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:04,701
LAURA: Yeah?

271
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:08,997
MATT: You go and inspect the armor itself, the
plates that separated and scraped from the impact

272
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:15,407
of Craven Edge's blade. The wound itself seems to
have at least stopped bleeding as part of the

273
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:21,334
healing magic and the wound has closed, though
you're still in a relatively damaged state

274
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:27,641
post-battle. You guys haven't had really a moment
to recover and heal what you could. She seems to

275
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:33,353
be okay. There's still that lingering sweat from
the stress and the impact of the blade, but

276
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:38,323
nothing seems to be mortally endangered about her
current state.

277
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:42,185
LIAM: Do you need a moment, do you need to speak
to Sarenrae?

278
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:48,647
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay. Do I know what hit
points I'm at?

279
00:20:48,647 --> 00:21:00,295
MATT: Yes. You're at 63.

280
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:05,143
ASHLEY: I'm doing okay.

281
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,636
LAURA: What time is it?

282
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:15,018
MATT: Right now, from the time it took you guys to
go through the temple and the strangeness that is

283
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:20,459
the shift of time around the temple, it's probably
mid-day. Pretty much the same time you entered the

284
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,633
temple.

285
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:22,976
MARISHA: Weird.

286
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:25,436
TRAVIS: I'm really sorry about that.

287
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:28,286
ASHLEY: Hey, it's okay, Grog. I know you didn't
mean to.

288
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:34,078
TRAVIS: No. No, I didn't. I was floating away, you
should've seen the inside. It was wind

289
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,206
everywhere.

290
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,242
ASHLEY: It sounds pretty crazy.

291
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:42,034
TRAVIS: Yeah. And I was like, what would my buddy Pike
do? She would take the sword and attach the chain

292
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,661
to it and throw it through the door! And then you
were there!

293
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,632
ASHLEY: It's okay, Grog! I'll be fine.

294
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,502
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you're my best buddy!

295
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:52,873
ASHLEY: Oh, Grog.

296
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:55,527
TRAVIS: Do you want one of my healing potions, are
you sure you're all right?

297
00:21:55,527 --> 00:22:03,026
ASHLEY: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be
okay. I think if we just-- (laughs) I'm excited to

298
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:04,379
see you guys.

299
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:07,180
(laughter)

300
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,389
ASHLEY: I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be
okay.

301
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:10,726
TRAVIS: Yeah!

302
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:13,027
ASHLEY: Are we taking a rest? I don't know how
many--

303
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,306
LAURA: It's mid-day!

304
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,326
TALIESIN: I think a short rest would not be a bad
idea.

305
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:25,355
MARISHA: I don't think this is actually the time
of day, I don't think nature works the same around

306
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,967
this temple.

307
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,198
TRAVIS: What do you mean? It's magic time of day?

308
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:32,245
MARISHA: Kind of, but it's always magic time of
day.

309
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:35,990
LAURA: So maybe we should hang out in the mouth of
the cave and take a short rest

310
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,792
MARISHA: I'm all right with that.

311
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,346
LAURA: Yes?

312
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,133
ASHLEY: I would be okay with that.

313
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:52,060
MATT: Ashley, you've used a 5th-level spell. How
many 4th-level spells do you have, because you

314
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:53,653
used two I believe?

315
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,825
ASHLEY: Three 4th-level.

316
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,184
MATT: So you have one left.

317
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:58,501
LAURA: Maybe we should take a long rest.

318
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:01,434
MARISHA: We could try and hoof it home.

319
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:06,184
TALIESIN: I think we start moving in that
direction and when nightfall comes we make camp.

320
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,208
TRAVIS: Towards the campsite?

321
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:14,818
LAURA: Unless I was healed, and I don't remember
being healed, I'm at 11 health points. So I'm

322
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:17,074
feeling a little sore.

323
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:18,602
ASHLEY: Oh gosh!

324
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,614
SAM: He only healed a couple of us.

325
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:23,078
MARISHA: I thought she was the one that he--

326
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:25,905
LAURA: He healed me back to my age.

327
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:33,421
MATT: Yeah, the aging effect was restored, but
only to her. The rest of you are still aged up

328
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,634
based on the effect of the lair of the sphinx.

329
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:38,422
MARISHA: That's something we're going to have to
Restoration away.

330
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,843
TRAVIS: Please, I'm handsome as fuck right now,
come on.

331
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:42,634
LAURA: Did you get aged?

332
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,254
TRAVIS: Like a fine wine. Yeah, I got aged.

333
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:50,812
ASHLEY: Can you do Greater Restoration on a
group?

334
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,907
MATT: No, on an individual each time.

335
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:54,508
ASHLEY: Who is the oldest?

336
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,804
TRAVIS: Well, she was.

337
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:57,300
LAURA: I was and he healed me.

338
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,746
LIAM: Typically Scanlan is the oldest, but I've
been aged the most maybe.

339
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:06,556
LAURA: He's really fucking old right now. Look at
all those wrinkles.

340
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:08,143
ASHLEY: How old are you?

341
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:10,862
LAURA: His ears are starting to droop!

342
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:14,196
MATT: If I recall, you aged close to roughly 20 to
25 years.

343
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:17,775
ASHLEY: You look like a fine wine, you just got
better with age.

344
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:21,301
LIAM: I knew that this was coming, I just thought
I had more years until it happened.

345
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:26,575
ASHLEY: They gray looks great on you, the salt and
pepper hair.

346
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:34,861
MARISHA: You should really look at this as a nice
peek into the future. It's not bad.

347
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:38,117
LIAM: Yeah, so--

348
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:41,832
ASHLEY: Would you like to be younger?

349
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:43,182
TRAVIS: Young again?

350
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,015
ASHLEY: Would you like to be young again?

351
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:46,403
LIAM: It's probably a good idea.

352
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:50,639
LAURA: Are you sure you want to do it, 
Pike, are you sure?

353
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:54,379
LIAM: You could do it tomorrow, could you take
care of my sister first, Pike?

354
00:24:54,379 --> 00:25:04,310
ASHLEY: Yes. We need to get you into better order,
okay? All right, where we at here?

355
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,162
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't cast that.

356
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:08,730
LIAM: Give her the works.

357
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,677
MARISHA: So, we are taking a short rest? I'm going
to burn a couple of hit dice.

358
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,186
LAURA: Shorty rest and then we'll walk.

359
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:15,504
MATT: Everyone taking a short rest?

360
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:16,290
TRAVIS: Yes.

361
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,211
MATT: Yes?

362
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,406
TRAVIS: (emphatically) Yes.

363
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:19,879
ASHLEY: I'm going to heal her up.

364
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,408
LAURA: I mean, I could roll my own hit dice.

365
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:25,847
ASHLEY: No, no, it's my job.

366
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:28,805
TRAVIS: So I lose all the buffs, right?

367
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:35,025
MATT: Here's what happens. So as you guys are
taking a rest, you step a little bit away from the

368
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:40,710
group, sit down and hold the blade. Chain's still
attached across your lap. Just look down at it and

369
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:49,371
you can see it's still pulsing with the power of
all the life energy that it'd taken before. And as

370
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:56,619
you take a moment, see to your wounds, relax,
recover from the intense rage and all the

371
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:04,643
emotional pain that's transpired here, the blade
begins to shrink. You hear the slight crackle

372
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:11,473
(squeal) as the metal begins to creak and pull
backward, all the jagged edges pulling into the

373
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:18,396
central singular curved blade at the front of it.
As it hits, it seems to almost shrink slightly

374
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:24,340
smaller than it was before and the metal creaks
for a second and a voice in your head goes,

375
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:32,171
(breathes heavily) "Hungry--" Make a constitution
saving throw.

376
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:37,991
SAM: Oh shit. Now it's going to steal his
strength.

377
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,473
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

378
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,588
MARISHA: What?

379
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:42,024
LIAM: Eat it, sword.

380
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:53,770
MATT: For but a moment, you sense a very similar
feeling, one that-- it's been really since the

381
00:26:53,770 --> 00:27:01,089
battle with K'Varn when all of the light in the
world vanished for a second and darkness took your

382
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:08,379
consciousness, and that same cold sensation starts
to stem from the blade itself like it's actually

383
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:15,817
trying to pull you into it, and you resist it. And
you stand there and look at the blade and it

384
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:21,233
just-- in comparison to its larger form, it looks
small. It's the same size it was since you

385
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:27,254
originally got it, but you look at it there in
this long, still silence as you try and conjecture

386
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:40,273
what just transpired. And in that silence you hear
the voice once again go, "Feed. Now."

387
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:44,223
TRAVIS: I don't have anything to feed you.

388
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:47,533
MATT: "Find something."

389
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:56,395
TRAVIS: (exhales) All right, all right, all right.
What?

390
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:59,644
LAURA: Who you talking to, Grog?

391
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,829
TRAVIS: I'm so hungry. My stomach's rumbling.

392
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:07,844
SAM: Don't we have our cold pack of food?

393
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:10,286
MARISHA: We do and we have some boar meat.

394
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:11,998
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

395
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:13,976
ASHLEY: Or some chicken?

396
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,524
LAURA: Yeah I did, I think I did take quite a bit
of chicken.

397
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,505
SAM: Love me some chicken.

398
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:25,597
MATT: As you open the freezer chest there's a
(poof) of chicken-scented smoke and mist that

399
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:26,497
vanishes.

400
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:32,505
LAURA: Aw, the chicken, we can't take it. That's
okay, I've got boar meat. Do you want to feed your

401
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:34,220
stomach the boar meat?

402
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,500
TRAVIS: What? My stomach?

403
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,717
ASHLEY: Yeah, are you hungry?

404
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,372
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would not turn down some delicious
boar.

405
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:44,810
LAURA: I'll mark it down to half the boar meat is
gone now, you guys.

406
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,346
SAM: Wow, he's a big eater. That was a lot. That
was a whole boar.

407
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:50,091
LAURA: Well, he's a big guy.

408
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:52,164
LIAM: You're a good hunter, though, it's not
really--

409
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:55,818
LAURA: That's right. Well?

410
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:59,355
TALIESIN: We can find some more boar if we have
to.

411
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,488
SAM: If we're rested, are we going to set off
again?

412
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:04,090
MATT: You guys can use your hit dice if you want
to, to heal up.

413
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,712
TRAVIS: Do I get a level of exhaustion back or no?
Long rest?

414
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,439
MATT: No, long rest for your exhaustion.

415
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,648
TRAVIS: Fuck!

416
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,115
ASHLEY: So short rest means--

417
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:14,399
LIAM: That sword is an asshole.

418
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,049
SAM: Be honest.

419
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,122
TRAVIS: That should've been at disadvantage.

420
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:22,209
TALIESIN: Yeah, should've been at disadvantage.

421
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,310
MATT: Roll again.

422
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,219
MARISHA: Oh fuck! No!

423
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,281
TALIESIN: Do it!

424
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,122
LAURA: You have to roll again?

425
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,635
SAM: He's exhausted.

426
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:32,019
ASHLEY: Fuck!

427
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,462
MARISHA: No! You're lying!

428
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,059
SAM: What is it?

429
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,887
TALIESIN: It's a one. He rolled a one.

430
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:40,590
LIAM: (high-pitched) What are the odds?

431
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,355
TRAVIS: 5% both times.

432
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,785
LIAM: Everybody roll for initiative

433
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,614
LAURA: No joke, though!

434
00:29:49,614 --> 00:30:00,879
MATT: As you guys finish your rest, and you're all
gathering the next stage of your advancement, you

435
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:10,470
watch as Grog stands up and starts walking into
the snow of the forest with the blade out, topples

436
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,940
and falls to one knee, then falls face-first in
the snow.

437
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,908
SAM: (yells)

438
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:18,459
ASHLEY: Grog? I run over to him.

439
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,939
LAURA: We all run out.

440
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:21,125
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:26,413
MATT: He's still, he's cold, there are no signs of
life.

442
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:30,548
LIAM: Roll him over, roll him over! Grog!

443
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,522
LAURA: I slap him across the face.

444
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:37,063
LIAM: Yeah. Punch him across the face. Grog!
Pike?

445
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:38,773
SAM: Heal, heal, heal!

446
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,954
ASHLEY: I grab the sword and I take it off of
his-- away from him, off of his person.

447
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:47,325
MATT: Okay, you pull the blade and you take it and
you shove it off, and the chain's still attached

448
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:51,308
to the side of his arm. You have to pull-- make a
strength check.

449
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:53,938
LIAM: Use those gauntlets.

450
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,438
LAURA: Oh yeah, 19!

451
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,526
ASHLEY: What do I-- roll the 20?

452
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,150
MATT: And add four to it.

453
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,870
ASHLEY: 11?

454
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,643
MATT: 11, that's enough. You (clink) and you pull
the chain off the side of his forearm, toss the

455
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:14,376
blade and it (scrapes) skids to a stop in the
snow, cutting a shallow swath through the little

456
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:22,891
bit of the embankment. Grog's still rolled on his
back, eyes just dead, lifeless.

457
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:24,087
ASHLEY: Okay.

458
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:26,107
MARISHA: Pike is it the sword, is it the sword?

459
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:28,335
ASHLEY: I feel like it's the sword, I mean we all
know that sword has been weird.

460
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:29,203
LAURA: Can you Greater Restoration him?

461
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:31,040
ASHLEY: Yes, I'll Greater Restoration on Grog.

462
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,113
MARISHA: While she does Greater Restoration, I
want to go over and--

463
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:35,898
LIAM: Break it.

464
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:37,603
LAURA: Don't break it!

465
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:43,447
MARISHA: -- grab the sword and see-- yeah,
actually, can I do like a--

466
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,763
SAM: Don't--

467
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:45,488
MARISHA: What?

468
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,278
SAM: Don't break it.

469
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:48,316
MARISHA: Why not?!

470
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:49,927
SAM: His soul could be inside of it

471
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,449
LAURA: What do you mean, his soul could be inside
of it?

472
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:56,167
SAM: I touched the sword, it spoke to me, it
craves strength from other beings

473
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:59,001
MARISHA: Wait, what do you mean it spoke to you?

474
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:03,635
MATT: Here's my question to you, Pike. What spells
do you have?

475
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:06,052
ASHLEY: Okay, so short rest--

476
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:10,655
MATT: Short rest doesn't give you any spells back.
What level spells do you have still?

477
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:13,676
ASHLEY: I have a 5th-level. I have one 5th-level,
which is Greater Restoration.

478
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:19,451
MATT: Right, you have Greater Restoration as an
option there. What other spells do you have prepared?

479
00:32:19,726 --> 00:32:25,008
ASHLEY: Aw, shit. I mean, Cure Wounds? No, that's
not going to do anything.

480
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:30,661
MATT: Because from your knowledge and experience,
Greater Restoration removes serious curses, it

481
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:32,330
removes avenues--

482
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,776
ASHLEY: But wouldn't that be--?

483
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:37,806
MATT: Grog, though you are having a hard time
coming to terms with it, in the back of your head

484
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:41,335
there's a part of you that knows that right now,
Grog in the snow is dead.

485
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,049
ASHLEY: Oh no!

486
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,069
LIAM: Where can we take him, where can we take
him?

487
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,056
LAURA: How can he be, how can he be dead?

488
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:48,794
LIAM: Can we take him to Gilmore, can we take him
to--?

489
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,292
MARISHA: Scanlan, what should I do with this
sword?

490
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:51,464
SAM: Don't break it.

491
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:55,435
MARISHA: Should I cast something through it to try
and purge whatever it is out of it?

492
00:32:55,435 --> 00:33:00,285
SAM: You could try to do Greater Restoration on
the sword to see if that would somehow free the

493
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:01,396
soul from it or--

494
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,786
MARISHA: I can do like a Sunbeam spell, that's
like a light spell.

495
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:09,253
LIAM: Who could we take him to, could we tree to
Gilmore?

496
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,053
LAURA: He wouldn't know anything about these-- Can
we go back in?

497
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:17,497
MARISHA: I didn't bring anything because we
decided to hoof it.

498
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:19,781
LAURA: What about going back to Kamal?

499
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:22,457
MARISHA: I didn't bring a transportation spell
because we decided to walk.

500
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:26,839
LAURA: No, but he's right inside the cave, what if
he knows things? The sphinx!

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,942
SAM: The sphinx-- yeah. We could go to the
sphinx.

502
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:32,091
ASHLEY: I have Heal, I have one 6th-level.

503
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:37,760
MATT: Heal? Heal restores damage or damaged flesh
to living entities.

504
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:44,012
LAURA: Me and Scanlan go back into the cave and
search for Kamal again.

505
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:48,962
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing the sword and taking it to
a corner and I'm going to stare at it for a second.

506
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:52,536
MATT: Okay. What are you doing, you're going
to...?

507
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:56,128
LAURA: Me and Scanlan take flight and we go back
in and we try to find Kamal again.

508
00:33:56,196 --> 00:34:02,434
MATT: Okay. You guys cruise into the cavern and as
you sit inside where the stairs were that led into

509
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,191
the temple, it's solid stone.

510
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:04,959
LAURA: Shit!

511
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,535
MATT: There's no sign of an entrance whatsoever to
this temple.

512
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:16,396
ASHLEY: Wait, wait. I have Revivify!

513
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:17,274
MATT: Okay.

514
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:18,196
SAM: Learned?

515
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:19,987
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.

516
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:21,186
MATT: Okay.

517
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,995
MARISHA: Has it been enough time?

518
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:25,517
ASHLEY: You touch a creature that has died--

519
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,715
MATT: Within the last minute.

520
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:31,370
LAURA: Has it been a minute? He just did it, it
just happened!

521
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,518
TALIESIN: It's barely been a minute of real time.

522
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:33,778
LAURA: We just ran over!

523
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,689
ASHLEY: I wasn't even looking at my 3rd-levels.

524
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:39,208
MATT: Ashley, go ahead and roll an initiative
check.

525
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,547
ASHLEY: Oh, goodness. Okay.

526
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:46,894
TALIESIN: Can I assist with a whisper to the
sword?

527
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:48,129
MATT: Sure.

528
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,981
SAM: Can I inspire her?

529
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,866
MATT: Sure.

530
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:52,686
SAM: Okay.

531
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:53,744
TALIESIN: You do first.

532
00:34:53,744 --> 00:35:02,057
SAM: I just hold her hand and I look in her eyes
and I just say, "Please, Pike, please. Please. I

533
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:05,092
love him as much as you do. Please."

534
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,473
ASHLEY: Okay.

535
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:11,732
MATT: Take your d10, and if you want to go ahead
and use that now or make this as part of the

536
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,194
resurrection ritual, which we're now undergoing.

537
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:16,426
LAURA: Oh my god.

538
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,440
ASHLEY: Can I do this first? Just to see if it
works?

539
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,715
MATT: Well, what'd you roll for your initiative?

540
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:21,486
ASHLEY: 14.

541
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:30,367
MATT: 14, okay. You get to his body and his back
rolled in the snow looking up, just as that window

542
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:34,523
of time begins to fade for the magic to have any
effect. You reach down and you grasp his

543
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:40,013
cold-muscled chest and you find the one singular
thread, that little soul thread that's still

544
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:48,070
connected to the essence of his eternal being that
once resided within this corpse and you clutch

545
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:57,214
onto it with the magic and hold on to it to begin
this ritual. Who wishes to bring something to this

546
00:35:57,214 --> 00:36:02,242
ritual? You have hold of the thread right now, you
need something stronger to keep him here.

547
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,215
LAURA: Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously)

548
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:06,995
TALIESIN: No! It's not stupid!

549
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:12,673
LAURA: Okay, okay. Then I reach into the Bag of
Holding and I get out Grog's cask of ale.

550
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:17,542
MATT: Okay. And--? And what do you do with it?

551
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:23,961
LAURA: Okay. I pour a little in his mouth. Just a
little bit, so he doesn't choke.

552
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:26,686
MATT: (laughing) You reach over and you grab the
edge of his beard and pull his mouth open, it's

553
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:31,250
hanging limply. You pull off the cork of the cask
and begin pouring it and it spills down the side

554
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,333
into the snow, darkening it on the sides of his
head.

555
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,428
LAURA: I turn his head so he doesn't drown in it.

556
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:40,472
MATT: Understood. Make a persuasion roll.

557
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:51,677
LAURA: This is so stressful. 16?

558
00:36:52,425 --> 00:37:00,932
MATT: Okay. The ale seems to slide back into the
throat and find its way in towards the stomach.

559
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:07,156
There is no swallowing motion whatsoever, but it
appears that at least it's not drowning him or

560
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:14,483
blocking his airway. You're clutching onto the
spirit here. You only have a few moments left

561
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:18,264
before the magic is lost. Who wishes to--

562
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:24,101
LIAM: While that's going on I walk off 30 feet
away and I fall to my knees on the ground facing

563
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:44,933
away. I know you are not what I want. But you are
what we need. And I will put aside my reservations

564
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:52,043
and serve you. It is too soon for him, we need
him. He is needed. I will set aside my

565
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:58,108
reservations and serve you. Please.

566
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:03,933
MATT: Go ahead and roll a religion check.

567
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:12,030
LIAM: 15.

568
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:20,092
MATT: 15. As you're looking up into the frozen
boughs of the trees before you, a little bit of

569
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:25,704
snow begins to fall from what was once the still
air. It begins to dot the top of your face and

570
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:34,047
touch your nose, and as the first cold singular
snowflake hits, your vision goes dark again. In

571
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:38,574
that darkness, you feel your breath go cold as
well, and your whole body is locked in place like

572
00:38:38,574 --> 00:38:43,339
it can't move. And all you see is the white
porcelain face of the Raven Queen step out of the

573
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:48,400
darkness as her hand comes up and touches the side
of your cheek. And a voice in your head, a

574
00:38:48,400 --> 00:39:00,349
familiar voice, says, "I believe that every death
has its place." And the hand lets go and pulls

575
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:07,610
back. Who wishes to make the third and final aid
to this ritual?

576
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,912
SAM: Have I already aided by inspiring Pike?

577
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:14,856
MATT: Well, if Pike wants to go ahead and make a
roll of some sort of attempt at this, that would

578
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,456
help as Bardic Inspiration.

579
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,510
SAM: But I can't help again?

580
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,762
MATT: If you wish to do your own thing, you can.

581
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:23,692
ASHLEY: Just for extra, yeah.

582
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:33,380
SAM: The sword seems to want power and strength. I
don't know if it will help, but maybe if we gave

583
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:41,458
Grog some extra strength it might help him to come
back, so. I have a Potion of Fire Giant Strength.

584
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,527
MARISHA: I could cast an Enhance Ability spell.

585
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:46,374
SAM: He has no abilities now, though.

586
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,430
MARISHA: That's true.

587
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:52,928
SAM: So I'm going to pour this Potion of Fire
Giant Strength into his gullet.

588
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,597
MATT: Okay.

589
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:56,095
SAM: Hope it gives him some sort of strength.

590
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,754
MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.

591
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:02,889
SAM: Okay. 18.

592
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:14,511
MATT: 18, okay. As you pour the potion into his
throat, the somewhat thick red and yellowish

593
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:20,128
compound that drips from it like a thicker
molasses finds its way, mingling with the ale

594
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:28,801
currently in his gullet. You help try and massage
it down, like feeding a pill to a dog. As you do,

595
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:33,512
you can see the veins around the shoulders
instinctually affected by this, as the flesh

596
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:38,677
itself, you know, the cells are still alive. It's
just the nervous system and all else that the

597
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:45,492
lights are currently out on. You hope this is
enough. And as you hold onto that singular thread

598
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:48,873
of Grog's existence--

599
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:54,315
LAURA: He's taking a picture

600
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:56,122
MARISHA: Why is he taking a picture?

601
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,930
SAM: Because it's not good.

602
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,287
TALIESIN: Because he's a terrible person, that's
why he's taking a picture.

603
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:02,858
MARISHA: It's either really good or really bad.

604
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:05,554
LAURA: I know, yeah, it's either really good or
really bad.

605
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:08,566
TRAVIS: I can't hide.

606
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,443
LAURA: Matthew!

607
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,682
MARISHA: This is bullshit.

608
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,363
MATT: As you're certainly staring at the sword--

609
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:18,380
TALIESIN: I was going to say something to it.

610
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,169
MATT: What do you say to it?

611
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:27,929
TALIESIN: If I were you, I'd put it back. Or else
it will be the last meal you ever eat, because I

612
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:34,261
will find an abyss so deep and so far you will
never taste a drop of blood again. And I'm not

613
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:39,035
touching it. I touched it and put it down and let
go and said that to it.

614
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:46,831
MATT: The shadow begins to bleed from the blade
and rise up and it seems almost like an incensed

615
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:53,935
fury from your words. However, you also hear a
raging scream bellow from inside the blade. A

616
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:57,825
familiar yell echoing in distant (roars).

617
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:02,496
TALIESIN: I'll start summoning my own fucking
mist, man, I'm not fucking intimidated by this shit.

618
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:08,444
MATT: Your shadow begins to rise over your back as
well. As it begins to coalesce, these two black

619
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:20,017
centers of dark energy facing off in wordless
anger and lack of understanding, the arm of Grog's

620
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:27,573
body grabs you by the throat and starts clutching
as it sits up and looks you in the face, eyes red

621
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:32,258
with rage, going (growl). Roll a strength check.

622
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,536
LAURA: Oh my god!

623
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:36,480
SAM: Strength check?! He's got 25 strength now!

624
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:37,885
TRAVIS: Disadvantage still?

625
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,476
MATT: Yes.

626
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,500
SAM: He's going to crush my neck.

627
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:44,146
TRAVIS: 11.

628
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:51,562
MATT: 11. He manages to close off the windpipe
just for a short moment, but in that time the red

629
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:59,582
fades from his eyes and the first inhale of breath
(gasps) comes into Grog's chest, and your vision

630
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:05,488
clears. And the moment of confusion hits you as
you look around and notice this tiny gnome in your

631
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:11,527
grip, head beet-red as you notice that your thumbs
are pressed into his larynx.

632
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:16,952
TRAVIS: No, no. No. (clears throat) What'd you do
to me?

633
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:21,355
SAM: (gasps) Nothing.

634
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,513
LAURA: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?

635
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,342
SAM: Gave you some ale.

636
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:29,432
SAM: What's with you and gnomes today, man?

637
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:35,406
TRAVIS: I like gnomes, I don't know! What? Why am
I down here?

638
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:39,433
MARISHA: Are we sure it's him? Scanlan? Percy?
Percy, are we sure?

639
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:43,583
SAM: Nope! I'm not sure. I'll do a perception
check to see if it's--

640
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:49,393
MARISHA: Can I also do an insight check? Can I
assist him or make an insight as well?

641
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,100
MATT: You can make your own insight check.

642
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,425
SAM: 17.

643
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:57,201
MARISHA: Sorry. 23.

644
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:02,742
LAURA: What?

645
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:04,468
TALIESIN: I love a whisper.

646
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:05,511
LIAM: I don't.

647
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:09,621
LAURA: How come he's getting a whisper and you're
not getting a whisper? Hey, you guys (sobbing)

648
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,947
check out those "How Do You Want to do This"
hoodies--

649
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:13,671
(laughter)

650
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:14,963
TALIESIN: I want to do this with great pain and
sadness.

651
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:16,650
ASHLEY: This is so stressful!

652
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,658
LAURA: Oh my god, you came back and Grog <i>died!</i>

653
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,696
ASHLEY: I want to go back!

654
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:27,246
MATT: He rolled a 20, then he rolled a one.

655
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:31,631
TRAVIS: I did my classic ten-minutes-later
remembering-the-rules shit.

656
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:33,953
MATT: That's right, because you got the third
point at the end of that battle because you

657
00:44:33,953 --> 00:44:35,420
frenzied for that last fight.

658
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,549
MARISHA: Grog! How many fingers am I holding up?

659
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,567
LIAM: Six.

660
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:40,577
TRAVIS: Nine!

661
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,987
MARISHA: I think it's him. All right.

662
00:44:43,987 --> 00:44:44,915
SAM: Oh my god.

663
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,000
LAURA: Grog, you died!

664
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,986
ASHLEY: You fell over dead!

665
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,961
MARISHA: How many more of us are going to die?!

666
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:52,355
TRAVIS: No, I didn't. No.

667
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:53,365
LAURA: Yes. You did.

668
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,295
TRAVIS: What, when?

669
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,090
LAURA: Pike saved you. Pike brought you back.

670
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,503
SAM: Where's your sword, Grog?

671
00:44:57,503 --> 00:45:00,849
TRAVIS: My sword is-- where is my sword?

672
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,211
SAM: Yeah, exactly.

673
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:04,238
ASHLEY: It's not your sword anymore.

674
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:07,372
TRAVIS: What do you mean?! Wait, wait. Where is
my-- where's Craven Edge?

675
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:11,746
MATT: You sit up and glance over, and you see
about 15 feet from you, set up against the bottom

676
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:17,862
of a tree, the blade is currently being crouched
over by Percy, his fingers tense, his shoulders

677
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:27,220
and back arched and locked, and you see two shadow
sources that are almost on their own subtle plane

678
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,920
having a staredown.

679
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:29,217
LAURA: Shit.

680
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:34,666
TRAVIS: Hey! Hey, Percy! Percy!

681
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:35,901
TALIESIN: Little busy.

682
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:39,295
MARISHA: Do you want to explain this, Grog?

683
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:41,472
LAURA: Can we see what's going on?

684
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:45,109
MATT: You guys look over and you see this
happening, yeah.

685
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:50,199
TRAVIS: Well, I mean he's obviously messing with
other people's property! And I walk over to the sword.

686
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:51,866
MARISHA: No, no, no!

687
00:45:51,866 --> 00:45:55,457
LAURA: I run over and I block it. I stand next to
Percy and I block the sword.

688
00:45:55,457 --> 00:45:56,510
TRAVIS: What?

689
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,053
ASHLEY: Yeah, I walk over and I stop Grog.

690
00:45:58,053 --> 00:46:04,010
LIAM: I'm pulling out daggers and standing behind
my sister. Grog. Grog, let it go.

691
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,816
TRAVIS: Let what--

692
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:08,969
LIAM: This has been something on the tip of our
tongue for weeks. Let it go. Whatever that thing

693
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:12,576
is, it's fucked. Let it go!

694
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:16,633
TRAVIS: But it's my sword.

695
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:23,526
MARISHA: It was never your sword, was it, Grog?

696
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:25,667
TRAVIS: I mean, Percy gave it to me, but it's
mine.

697
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,706
LAURA: Percy gave it to you?

698
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:30,417
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, he let him have it.

699
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,940
TRAVIS: Yeah, we traded. Fair and square.

700
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:35,011
LIAM: What did you say?

701
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:37,245
TALIESIN: Little busy.

702
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,619
LIAM: Scanlan, what?

703
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:51,812
SAM: Grog, listen, when I experienced the sword,
it was pretty cool, and it is a powerful, powerful

704
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:58,191
weapon, but after seeing what it's just done to
you, I don't think you can have it, man.

705
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:04,509
TRAVIS: I'm still a bit fuzzy. Like I mean, you
know, we fought the sphinx, it got super-gnarly,

706
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:07,369
and then we took a little rest and you-- did you
see it shrunk?

707
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:13,586
LAURA: Grog! The sword pulled you into it! You
were dead, your soul was with whatever the fuck is

708
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:16,393
in there now.

709
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,291
TRAVIS: Well, how did I get out of there?

710
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,444
LAURA: Pike saved you.

711
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:20,716
ASHLEY: We brought you back!

712
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:21,977
SAM: We? It was you, Pike.

713
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,173
TRAVIS: Oh, like just now?

714
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,497
ASHLEY: It was a group effort!

715
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:29,568
TRAVIS: Why do I taste ale, and whiskey?

716
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:35,710
ASHLEY: Because she gave you a little to bring you
back!

717
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,195
TRAVIS: I mean, I didn't know if I'd thrown up in
my mouth, and like swallowed it.

718
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:40,043
MATT: The shadow has now rescinded into the
blade.

719
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:41,142
TALIESIN: Keyleth?

720
00:47:41,142 --> 00:47:44,171
MARISHA: Yes, Percy?

721
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:51,551
TALIESIN: I'm debating whether or not to
touch the sword. And I'm debating whether

722
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,020
or not you should touch the sword.

723
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,543
LAURA: Nobody should touch the sword, Percy.

724
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:56,607
TALIESIN: We have to move it.

725
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,090
SAM: I've touched it before and it was fine. I can
touch it again.

726
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,925
ASHLEY: Well, I could try to--

727
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,467
LAURA: I feel like it's going to try and suck
anybody in right now.

728
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,160
MARISHA: Well, what should we do with it? We
should get rid of it?

729
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,269
TRAVIS: Look, guys, I can carry it at least.

730
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:06,991
LAURA: No.

731
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:08,764
ASHLEY: No! You're not going to touch it again!

732
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:09,785
TALIESIN: It's a bad deal.

733
00:48:09,785 --> 00:48:13,370
LIAM: Put it in the Bag of Holding and give the
Bag of Holding to Pike.

734
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:19,137
MARISHA: Wait, no, we're not putting that in the
Bag of Holding. That sounds like a terrible idea.

735
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:21,381
However, let me read something really fast.

736
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:24,278
LAURA: Can we talk to it? I mean, can we see what
it is?

737
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,476
MATT: I mean, you see a blade before you.

738
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:27,533
LAURA: The shadow's not there anymore?

739
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:31,106
MATT: The shadow's pulled back into the blade.

740
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:32,821
ASHLEY: Percy, what did you get from it?

741
00:48:32,821 --> 00:48:35,368
LAURA: I mean, what did it sound like?

742
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:37,017
SAM: It sounded evil.

743
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:40,094
TRAVIS: Well, now, that's really judgmental.

744
00:48:40,094 --> 00:48:41,728
SAM: And also awesomely powerful.

745
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:42,551
TRAVIS: Yeah.

746
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,170
ASHLEY: What were you going to say, Vax?

747
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,431
LIAM: de Rolo knew about this. That's perfectly
clear. You knew about this too, Scanlan?

748
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:56,426
SAM: I didn't know what it was. And I wasn't alone
in this; I had asked Pike to weigh in and she was

749
00:48:56,426 --> 00:49:01,567
thinking about it. Doing more research.

750
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:02,991
ASHLEY: That's true.

751
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:06,724
MARISHA: Pike knew about it as well? Wait, how
many people knew about this?

752
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:11,264
TRAVIS: Yeah! Only four of us. Look, it's been a
great ally!

753
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:14,633
LAURA: Four out of seven!

754
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:18,620
SAM: Vax, I assume you have secrets you haven't
told us.

755
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,457
LAURA: He has a third testicle. It's out. There, I
said it!

756
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:24,986
LIAM: That's a great time for a joke. That's a
great time for a joke.

757
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:27,053
TALIESIN: Best time for a joke.

758
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:29,230
SAM: The weird part is it's not in his crotch
area.

759
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,777
ASHLEY: I could try casting Greater Restoration on
the sword.

760
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:35,337
MARISHA: I might be able to Banish it.

761
00:49:35,337 --> 00:49:36,773
TALIESIN: Can you do that?

762
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,339
TRAVIS: Well, that's a bit strong, don't you
think?

763
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,074
SAM: And that's only for a minute.

764
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:46,003
MARISHA: No, I can do a more permanent version of
that. I've never tried it before. And it's a

765
00:49:46,003 --> 00:49:47,797
7th-level spell.

766
00:49:47,797 --> 00:49:52,791
TRAVIS: Look, look! Okay. Look, if you get bucked
off a horse, right? You don't kill the horse, you

767
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:56,968
just train it up a bit. Let's just work with the
sword.

768
00:49:56,968 --> 00:49:59,708
LAURA: Horses don't try to steal your soul, Grog.

769
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:03,033
LIAM: Who owned the sword before you had it? Who?

770
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,652
TRAVIS: Ah. Well.

771
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:06,883
LIAM: Find it on the ground?

772
00:50:06,883 --> 00:50:08,509
LAURA: Oh. It was Lord Briarwood.

773
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:13,480
LIAM: It's very familiar, that's right. It
belonged to the arch-vampire who we fucked up.

774
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,442
TRAVIS: Yeah. Right.

775
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:18,553
MARISHA: And I hate to be the one to point it out,
but I feel like you've been almost a little bit

776
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:22,962
more brutal than you usually are here lately,
which is almost impressive.

777
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:30,614
TALIESIN: Grog, I'm going to make you a deal.
We're going to deal with this as a family, and

778
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:33,262
we're going to get you something much nicer.

779
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:34,178
MARISHA: It just killed you.

780
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:39,842
TALIESIN: Right away. We're going to replace it
with something a little less complicated.

781
00:50:39,842 --> 00:50:45,310
LAURA: Maybe some bone knuckles? I hear those are
pretty badass.

782
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,428
TRAVIS: Bone?

783
00:50:47,428 --> 00:50:48,751
LAURA: Giant's bone?

784
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:49,751
TRAVIS: Titanstone?

785
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:51,514
MARISHA: Maybe a family heirloom?

786
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,561
TALIESIN: Perhaps it's time to be a better
badass.

787
00:50:53,561 --> 00:51:00,078
SAM: Does, DM, does Suggestion last forever or
just for a little amount of time?

788
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:03,664
MATT: Suggestion, I think it lasts for a short
time.

789
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:09,267
MARISHA: I can attempt to Plane Shift this into
another dimension.

790
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:13,795
LAURA: No, how about we just wrap it in fabric.
No?

791
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:17,147
TRAVIS: Well look, hey, look, all right, fine,
look, I won't touch it. But can we like at least

792
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:22,127
figure out what it was doing? Lord Briarwood had
it, I asked it a few questions, like if it knew

793
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:28,440
Vecna. And we just got to see it level up
a little bit.

794
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,596
MARISHA: What all has it told you, Grog?

795
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:34,047
TRAVIS: It's always hungry, right, so it likes to
be, it likes what I do--

796
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:34,902
ASHLEY: Grog!

797
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:37,005
TRAVIS: What? What, I'm hungry too!

798
00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:41,195
LIAM: Show of hands. Who here is
uncomfortable with that piece of shit?

799
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:43,732
ASHLEY: I mean, it stabbed me, so yeah,
I'm uncomfortable.

800
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:45,095
TRAVIS: I said I was sorry, I really--

801
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:47,885
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's not your fault.

802
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:52,072
LAURA: But I do think that whatever it is might
know something.

803
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,405
MARISHA: Well, Grog said he's been talking to it,
which makes--

804
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:58,487
TALIESIN: You don't want to interrogate it,
because if we interrogate it we're going to have

805
00:51:58,487 --> 00:51:59,966
to make a deal.

806
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:02,479
LIAM: You have to choose between this group and
that sword.

807
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:06,988
TRAVIS: Oh, well I choose the group, I mean, I
voted I was uncomfortable as well.

808
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:09,354
LIAM: So what are we arguing about?

809
00:52:09,354 --> 00:52:13,709
TRAVIS: Well, I don't just want to destroy it.

810
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:17,570
MARISHA: It served its purpose. You got its fair
use. You got your money's worth, which was free.

811
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,586
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I could use it on Kevdak.

812
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,275
TALIESIN: It can use you on Kevdak.

813
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:25,503
LAURA: Do not use it against Kevdak. You
don't want something making your

814
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:28,280
strength unnatural when you fight your
new foe.

815
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,742
TRAVIS: Well look, the last I remember was it said
it was hungry. If it gets hungry again, I'll just

816
00:52:31,742 --> 00:52:33,044
give it something to eat.

817
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:34,015
MARISHA: Like one of us?

818
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:36,809
TRAVIS: No, like my thigh or something.

819
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:38,384
LAURA: You'll chop off your own leg--

820
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:40,009
TRAVIS: No, I would just stab it.

821
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:44,038
MARISHA: You want to sacrifice your own leg for a
sword?

822
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:49,734
TRAVIS: Kevdak has the Titanstone Knuckles. It's a
Vestige that we're looking for, right? It's going

823
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:52,197
to be a hell of a fight, and this is a hell of a
sword.

824
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:55,038
LAURA: He's got a Vestige. He's still just him.

825
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,524
LIAM: The sword just fucking killed you, you
dummy!

826
00:52:57,524 --> 00:53:01,812
MARISHA: And you were far powerful before the
sword. You killed Lord Briarwood

827
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,025
without the sword.

828
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:05,056
LAURA: That's right.

829
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,855
MARISHA: The sword didn't make you Grog.

830
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:17,231
TRAVIS: All right, hold on, Pike. Look. If we're
going back to Kevdak. You know I'm not scared of

831
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:25,205
death, right? I would die by a dragon, I would die
by a beholder, and I wouldn't care, as long as it

832
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:33,436
was a beautiful death. But I don't want to die
from Kevdak. Not him.

833
00:53:37,486 --> 00:53:44,840
ASHLEY: We'll find you a better weapon. I don't
want you to die from something

834
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:51,052
that's not worth it.

835
00:53:51,052 --> 00:53:59,984
TRAVIS: All right. Fine. Do what you want with it.
I don't need it.

836
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:03,542
TALIESIN: What do you think we should do with it?

837
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:08,296
ASHLEY: We'll find you something strong.

838
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:09,708
TRAVIS: This is an empty cup.

839
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,209
TALIESIN: Oh, we've already poured it into your
mouth.

840
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:16,577
LAURA: No, there's a little left in the cask,
here. Here's your cask.

841
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:20,776
TRAVIS: I throw the cup away and just take the
cask.

842
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:24,690
MARISHA: All right. Should I attempt to banish
this thing forever?

843
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,224
SAM: You can banish something forever?

844
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:30,598
MARISHA: It's called Plane Shift, I can shift it
into its own little pocket dimension where it'll

845
00:54:30,598 --> 00:54:32,721
stay and nothing else can get to it.

846
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:37,011
TALIESIN: I think I'm perfectly content with it
being someone else's problem.

847
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:38,655
MARISHA: All right.

848
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:42,188
TALIESIN: I'm staring hard to make sure it's not
going to fight this.

849
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:46,437
MARISHA: So looking at Plane Shift, it says you
can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature

850
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:56,853
to another plane. But I can also transport eight
willing creatures, so can I hold the sword and

851
00:54:56,853 --> 00:54:58,891
attempt to Plane Shift it away?

852
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:04,223
MATT: I don't see why you would not be able to do
that to an object, honestly. Especially based on

853
00:55:04,223 --> 00:55:08,854
the power of the spell. Where would you want to
banish it to?

854
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:11,164
MARISHA: Ooh. Ooh! Ooh!

855
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,276
LIAM: Newark.

856
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:20,133
MARISHA: The pocket dimension of the green-eyed
boy. The golden-eyed boy.

857
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:21,275
MATT: Oh!

858
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:22,618
LAURA: The Dread Emperor that we already killed.

859
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:26,232
MARISHA: Yes, it was empty, it was his own
dimension and he's dead.

860
00:55:26,232 --> 00:55:27,415
MATT: It was the Dread Emperor.

861
00:55:27,415 --> 00:55:29,516
TALIESIN: Well, let's think about this.

862
00:55:29,516 --> 00:55:31,042
MARISHA: What?

863
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,032
SAM: What else lives there?

864
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,117
MARISHA: Nothing.

865
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:38,624
LIAM: It was an island with child labor, it's
full-circle for Keyleth.

866
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:42,595
TALIESIN: I'm going to suggest something that's
going to sound a little iffy, but I swear to god

867
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:52,296
I'm being clever. Send it somewhere where it will
be content. Let's not anger something. Where do we

868
00:55:52,296 --> 00:55:55,624
send vampires?

869
00:55:55,624 --> 00:56:00,997
MARISHA: I could easily send it to one of the Nine
Hells, where I'm sure someone would be very happy

870
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:02,652
with the new gift they just found.

871
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:03,605
LAURA: No! Somebody could use it.

872
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:04,200
MARISHA: Exactly.

873
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,469
TALIESIN: But they would be using it in the Nine
Hells. And it's going--

874
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:12,495
MARISHA: Yes, but you forget that all these planes
cross over. We have fought many a demon.

875
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,056
LIAM: I don't want to send it to the Hells.

876
00:56:15,056 --> 00:56:19,295
TRAVIS: Can I make like one little suggestion that
doesn't involve it coming back to me? I had a

877
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:26,187
thought that since Lord Briarwood had it before,
that every time it killed it might've been sending

878
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:31,670
that life back to Vecna? But I don't have any
proof of that, you know, I just remember being in

879
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:35,601
that room with all the bodies, with the little
sphere of-- the little dough button in the middle

880
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,835
of the room.

881
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:39,587
SAM: We could throw it in the sphere.

882
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:40,599
LAURA: No.

883
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:44,129
TALIESIN: No. That might go poorly.

884
00:56:44,129 --> 00:56:47,129
TRAVIS: Or really cool?

885
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:49,619
MARISHA: I mean, does anyone else have any better
ideas where to send this thing?

886
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,465
ASHLEY: What would happen if you threw it into the
sphere?

887
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:53,767
SAM: Vecna would get it, right?

888
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:56,415
ASHLEY: It would get, yeah, that would be bad.

889
00:56:56,415 --> 00:56:59,756
LAURA: How about you throw it in that pocket
dimension and then we can always go to that same

890
00:56:59,756 --> 00:57:02,953
pocket dimension and get it if we decide
it's bad there.

891
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:03,709
LIAM: Yes.

892
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:09,231
MARISHA: That's true. I mean, it's its own little
pocket. It's at least blocked off.

893
00:57:09,231 --> 00:57:11,155
That we know of.

894
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:14,289
LAURA: Drop it in a thorny patch.

895
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:17,785
MARISHA: I'm going to go for that Dread Emperor
dimension.

896
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:20,122
LIAM: Percival? Percy?

897
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:20,830
TALIESIN: Yes?

898
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:21,767
LIAM: You are clever.

899
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:22,524
TALIESIN: I am.

900
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,291
LIAM: It doesn't mean you're always right.

901
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,651
TALIESIN: I know. I know.

902
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,877
MARISHA: And you do have this terrible habit of
liking to push problems on other people.

903
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:32,234
ASHLEY: You don't think it would work if I tried
Greater Restoration?

904
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:34,496
LAURA: Do you have any more 5th-level?

905
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:36,510
ASHLEY: I do, I have one more 5th-level.

906
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:37,369
LAURA: Oh, you do?

907
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:38,010
ASHLEY: I do.

908
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,787
TALIESIN: I don't think so, but what do I know?

909
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,469
LAURA: Why not try it? Before we send it.

910
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:44,090
LIAM: We can camp here for the night. We don't
have to go anywhere.

911
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,309
TALIESIN: That's fair, yes.

912
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:47,017
MARISHA: Wait, you want to do Greater Restoration,
why?

913
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:49,441
TALIESIN: On the sword.

914
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:51,172
TRAVIS: I'm at one hitpoint.

915
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,303
LAURA: You're at--?

916
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,404
TALIESIN: I'm going to kick myself if I'm right.

917
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,829
ASHLEY: Okay, hold on a minute.

918
00:57:56,829 --> 00:58:00,269
TRAVIS: I could just take a healing potion.

919
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,324
MARISHA: It needs a wielder, Percy.

920
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:06,746
TALIESIN: Does it? All right, let's-- go
ahead. I'm curious.

921
00:58:06,746 --> 00:58:13,027
ASHLEY: First, Grog is at one hit point.
Okay? So I'm going to use my 6th-level and

922
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:14,589
I'm going to use Heal.

923
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:15,507
LAURA: Okay.

924
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:22,969
MATT: All right. As Pike turns to you, looks you
in the eye, clutching her holy symbol of Sarenrae,

925
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:28,901
there's a smile at the corner of her mouth at
noticing that her friend is back. Though as

926
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:35,232
tenuous as this argument has been, and you weren't
present for the scare that was there, you can see

927
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:42,112
there is a genuine shake to a lot of their
fingertips from what has just transpired. She

928
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:45,653
reaches forward and touches you and you
immediately heal 70 hitpoints.

929
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:48,951
LAURA: Bam! Shebang.

930
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:53,518
TRAVIS: (sings) I feel amazing.

931
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:56,491
LAURA: What do you think Greater Restoration will
do?

932
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:02,737
ASHLEY: I don't know. Because I remember it worked
one time on-- didn't we try that on his--

933
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:05,681
TALIESIN: In my mind I have a worst-case scenario,
but.

934
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:09,788
LAURA: I'm afraid it will make whatever's in the
sword come out.

935
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:11,710
MARISHA: That's what I'm afraid of as well.

936
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:16,185
LAURA: But if it comes out then we can banish
it or kill it and--

937
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:21,720
ASHLEY: And then he could keep the sword.

938
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,741
LAURA: It will be just a useless sword at that
point.

939
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:27,167
TRAVIS: Not if I'm wielding it.

940
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:28,882
SAM: Something tells me you won't be wielding it.

941
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:31,337
TALIESIN: I'm tempted to ask you to do it
just because I would love to be wrong.

942
00:59:31,337 --> 00:59:33,041
LAURA: Fucking try it, Pike!

943
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:34,827
ASHLEY: Should we try it? Let's try it.

944
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:37,557
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it. We've got a backup
if there's something wrong.

945
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:45,471
MATT: So, as Pike turns around from Grog, the
softness in her face fades, and the hard jawline

946
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:54,460
of Pike Trickfoot, seafaring gnome cleric, steps
across the snow, step by step towards the darkened

947
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:03,178
blade that nearly stole away her childhood friend.
Still clutching in one ogre-gauntleted fist the

948
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:08,958
symbol of Sarenrae, your other hand comes out and
you can see the shadow begin to spill from the

949
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,659
blade as you approach.

950
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:13,656
MARISHA: Pike, be careful.

951
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:22,529
SAM: I'm going to inspire her again. I'm going to
sing a very romantic ballad.

952
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:23,618
ASHLEY: Bring it.

953
01:00:23,618 --> 01:00:32,173
SAM: (sings) Oh my little pretty one, my little
pretty one, Pike the Gnome-a, oh you make my

954
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:38,217
nipples hum, my nipples hum, oh you make my
nipples hum, Pike the Gnome-a.

955
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,438
(laughter)

956
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,169
MATT: Take your d10 inspiration.

957
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:47,128
LIAM: All sad and tragic and with gravitas.

958
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:48,475
ASHLEY: A d10?

959
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:50,214
MATT: A d10 inspiration die.

960
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:52,289
ASHLEY: That was beautiful, Scanlan.

961
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:53,905
SAM: I know.

962
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:58,192
MATT: All right. As you step forward and the
shadow begins to emanate from the blade, you focus

963
01:00:58,192 --> 01:01:02,309
and concentrate, and as you do, the light of
Sarenrae begins to glow from the front of your

964
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:06,763
hand, and as it does, the shadow seems to be cast
away, and the blade now stands currently bare

965
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:14,019
before you. You reach out and touch the blade and
recite a few words under your breath, and release

966
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:23,003
the energy of the spell into the sword. Go ahead
and make a wisdom check. Just roll a d20 and add

967
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:24,223
your wisdom modifier.

968
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:26,241
ASHLEY: Okay.

969
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:33,958
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

970
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:35,489
ASHLEY: 17.

971
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:37,543
SAM: You also have inspiration if you need it.

972
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:39,267
ASHLEY: Okay.

973
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:40,975
MATT: Add your d10 inspiration die to it.

974
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:43,919
LIAM: Yeah!

975
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:47,696
ASHLEY: 26. No, wait. Yeah, 26.

976
01:01:47,696 --> 01:01:52,051
MATT: As you reach out and touch the blade, you
can feel suddenly the dark, chaotic presence in

977
01:01:52,051 --> 01:01:59,662
there. you can see flashes in your mind of an
individual, an ancient person. You see flashes in

978
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:10,343
your head of a clamoring for power, a need for
attention and wealth. You see a person making a

979
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:18,302
deal with something it didn't understand. You see
a flash of a punishment. You see the remnants of

980
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:24,464
their eternal soul bound to a blade. You see
themselves cursed with eternal, gluttonous,

981
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:32,404
unending hunger and cast through the ages, the
rest forgotten. And you see, just like the

982
01:02:32,404 --> 01:02:39,345
singular thread that was holding Grog to his
corpse, a dark, dark thread that connects the

983
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:47,516
sword to Grog. And with this spell, you grasp out
and clutch it-- and tear it in two. Grog, wherever

984
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:52,028
you're standing, it's like you just got punched in
the gut. You're thrown off your feet and land in

985
01:02:52,028 --> 01:02:57,133
the snow once again, eyes wide open. All of you
freak out because it's just like how Grog fell

986
01:02:57,133 --> 01:03:05,243
originally, except for he shoots up, heavy
breathing, alive. With that, the blade

987
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:06,824
just snarls in your grasp.

988
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:14,685
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oopsie.

989
01:03:14,685 --> 01:03:16,976
LAURA: What just happened?

990
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:23,829
MATT: Grog? That fucking blade ate your soul.

991
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:27,065
TRAVIS: What?

992
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:31,422
MATT: You wonder, this entire time, how you could
be so foolish to give into something that this

993
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:33,930
whole time has been using you.

994
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:42,008
TRAVIS: How could I have been so foolish? This
whole time, that fucking blade has been using me!

995
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:45,124
MARISHA: Pike, let go, let go. Before it--

996
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:46,020
LAURA: Drop the sword.

997
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,498
ASHLEY: I'm scared to let go of it.

998
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:48,978
MARISHA: Let go of it!

999
01:03:48,978 --> 01:03:54,332
MATT: (impact) It sits in the snow. Motionless.

1000
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:56,455
LIAM: Keyleth?

1001
01:03:56,455 --> 01:04:01,503
MARISHA: It didn't attach itself to you now, did
it, or anything?

1002
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,348
ASHLEY: No. No.

1003
01:04:03,348 --> 01:04:08,855
TRAVIS: Yo, guys, update. That sword is totally
evil.

1004
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:11,156
ASHLEY: Grog, what did you think we were telling
you?

1005
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:17,345
MARISHA: I reach out and I Plane Shift it to the
pocket dimension of the Dread Emperor.

1006
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:20,190
MATT: Okay, you reach out and you pick up the
blade, and as you grab it in your hand you can

1007
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:28,288
hear the voice, "You! I will--" And before it can
finish the phrase, you guys watch as a little thin

1008
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:34,748
slit within the plane just shutters open, and you
have a quick glance at that distant starscape with

1009
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:43,203
various broken, slowly floating islands of earth
and rock. You see the partially destroyed bramble

1010
01:04:43,203 --> 01:04:48,065
forest that you once trekked through, and with
that, you throw the blade through the small

1011
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:49,097
doorway--

1012
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,720
LAURA: Eat it, Craven Edge!

1013
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,995
LIAM: (tiny voice) Help meeee.

1014
01:04:51,995 --> 01:04:54,195
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not cravin' bacon anymore!

1015
01:04:54,195 --> 01:04:57,163
MATT: It slams shut and is gone.

1016
01:04:57,163 --> 01:05:01,663
LAURA: Well? Fingers crossed nobody gets it.

1017
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:06,155
TRAVIS: And there was a dagger that came with it.

1018
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:07,511
LAURA, MARISHA and TALIESIN: What?

1019
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:09,532
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm fucking with you.

1020
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:11,568
ASHLEY: Grog.

1021
01:05:11,568 --> 01:05:16,074
MARISHA: I know how that spell works now! That's
nice.

1022
01:05:16,074 --> 01:05:17,718
LIAM: What do you say we camp here for the night,
everybody?

1023
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:19,234
TALIESIN: Let's camp here for the night.

1024
01:05:19,234 --> 01:05:20,729
LIAM: Right in the cave.

1025
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,001
SAM: Wait, it's not at night, it's the middle of
the day.

1026
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:26,144
LAURA: We can just fucking hang out for a day.

1027
01:05:26,144 --> 01:05:27,826
SAM: Shouldn't we start walking?

1028
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:29,380
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No.

1029
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,672
LAURA: She's out of spells.

1030
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:32,635
LIAM: You got a hard-on for adventure, little
man?

1031
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:40,812
SAM: I just think we should make headway if we're
going to be traveling all day. Grog, do you even

1032
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:41,950
have any weapons anymore?

1033
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,362
TRAVIS: I'm super exhausted--

1034
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:44,997
LAURA: Yeah, he's got so many weapons.

1035
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:47,635
SAM: I could lend you my whip if you'd like.

1036
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:52,077
TRAVIS: No, I'm like Northrop Grumman meets
Raytheon in this Bag of Holding, we're good.

1037
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:57,231
ASHLEY: Since we got rid of Craven Edge, do you
want the Gauntlets of Ogre Power back?

1038
01:05:57,231 --> 01:06:01,198
TRAVIS: Oh no, I just gave them to you, though.

1039
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:06,443
ASHLEY: Yeah, but you're the muscle. I take them
off and I give them back.

1040
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:11,935
TRAVIS: What about if I trade you, what if I trade
you--

1041
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:13,736
ASHLEY: Are we doing a trade?

1042
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:17,094
TRAVIS: I have Boots of Levitation.

1043
01:06:17,094 --> 01:06:18,243
ASHLEY: Ooh!

1044
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:22,111
TRAVIS: Or I have black iron plate that while
wearing this heavy plate armor the bearer gains

1045
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,530
resistance to any fire damage.

1046
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,297
LAURA: Ooh! That's good.

1047
01:06:26,297 --> 01:06:27,623
SAM: She already has plate armor.

1048
01:06:27,623 --> 01:06:29,696
LAURA: Yeah, but this one gives her fire
resistance.

1049
01:06:29,696 --> 01:06:32,659
ASHLEY: Does it maybe make me quiet as well?

1050
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:35,135
TRAVIS: I bet if you levitate you'd just be
floating above the ground.

1051
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,890
LIAM: Levitate would make her quiet, yeah.

1052
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,840
LAURA: Does she have to-- in the levitation boots,
can you move?

1053
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,965
MATT: Levitation, someone has to push you along.

1054
01:06:44,965 --> 01:06:46,881
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, that's fine, I'll take care of
that.

1055
01:06:46,881 --> 01:06:49,022
MARISHA: Oh my god, we can get like a little kid
leash for you.

1056
01:06:49,022 --> 01:06:51,755
LAURA: We could tie her onto the broom, we could
tie her onto the broom!

1057
01:06:51,755 --> 01:06:54,501
ASHLEY: I could be a Pike kite!

1058
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:56,666
MARISHA: It'll be like that scene in Inception.

1059
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:59,998
TRAVIS: Yes! We'll discover electricity with you,
you're a great conductor.

1060
01:06:59,998 --> 01:07:02,843
ASHLEY: Grog, that would kill me!

1061
01:07:02,843 --> 01:07:06,713
TRAVIS: Oh. That's true.

1062
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:08,105
Which one you want?

1063
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:10,657
ASHLEY: All right, I'll take Boots of Levitation.
And you get these so you're super strong again.

1064
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:15,234
TRAVIS: I'll take my Gauntlets of Ogre Power back,
strength back up to 19.

1065
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:19,477
LIAM: It was good times, though, Pike in those
gauntlets. That was pretty cool.

1066
01:07:19,477 --> 01:07:22,855
ASHLEY: Hey, I felt real cool punching that
chicken that one time.

1067
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:28,090
(laughter)

1068
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,525
ASHLEY: One day I'll be strong.

1069
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:37,183
SAM: Well, I think you just cured Grog, saved his
life, and got rid of a soul-eating sword, so

1070
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:38,567
you're pretty strong.

1071
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:40,213
ASHLEY: What did you say?

1072
01:07:40,213 --> 01:07:43,937
SAM: You killed the sword and saved Grog's life,
so I think you're pretty strong.

1073
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:45,472
ASHLEY: That's true, that's most important.

1074
01:07:45,472 --> 01:07:46,701
TRAVIS: Way to go, badass.

1075
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:47,671
ASHLEY: Hey, thanks.

1076
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:48,748
TRAVIS: No problem, man.

1077
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:49,826
ASHLEY: Anytime.

1078
01:07:49,826 --> 01:07:52,718
MATT: (laughs) All right. So you guys go ahead and
take a--

1079
01:07:52,718 --> 01:07:54,126
TRAVIS: Long.

1080
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:57,717
LAURA: We just short-rested, but now we're going
to sleep. It's been a traumatic five minutes.

1081
01:07:57,717 --> 01:08:00,883
TALIESIN: We were in a time vortex, really it's
time to sleep.

1082
01:08:00,883 --> 01:08:02,632
MATT: Fair enough. Where're you resting?

1083
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:05,049
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: In the mouth of the
cave.

1084
01:08:05,049 --> 01:08:07,472
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

1085
01:08:07,472 --> 01:08:11,660
SAM: You guys can sleep wherever you want. I'll be
sleeping in my bed.

1086
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,194
LAURA: Oh, in the mansion, fuck, we'll sleep in
the mansion.

1087
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:17,097
LIAM: Sorry, you know, it's so new, it's hard to
remember--

1088
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,623
LAURA: --that we have that.

1089
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,137
SAM: Yeah. We do have it.

1090
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:29,630
MARISHA: Can I blow my last 5th-level spell to
Greater Restoration somebody from their age?

1091
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,366
MATT: Sure, yeah.

1092
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:36,449
SAM: Oh, do we know? Are we aware that we went
under that effect, I mean we just feel different,

1093
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:37,344
or how do--

1094
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:41,111
MATT: No, you guys have-- it's one of those things
where you felt the impact happen and you saw each

1095
01:08:41,111 --> 01:08:44,839
other rapidly age for those that were present, and
even afterward there's a noticeable effect, so

1096
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:49,778
yeah. You would be able to ascertain via those
situations, and the time you've had to rest to

1097
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:55,711
think over the battle and see that difference.
Plus the fact that you watched Vex get cured of

1098
01:08:55,711 --> 01:09:00,040
that aging effect by the sphinx before you left,
that was also the big indicator.

1099
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,798
So you would be aware.

1100
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:03,787
MARISHA: Who wants to go first?

1101
01:09:03,787 --> 01:09:05,880
SAM: You can do multiples?

1102
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,918
MARISHA: No, just one tonight. The rest of y'all
have to stay old.

1103
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:12,600
TRAVIS: Take ol' wrinkly-nuts over there.
(laughs)

1104
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,463
LAURA: Triple the wrinkles, triple the nuts.

1105
01:09:16,463 --> 01:09:18,246
MARISHA: All right, come here, Vax.

1106
01:09:18,246 --> 01:09:22,604
LIAM: Here I come, ol' wrinkly-nuts.

1107
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:28,514
TALIESIN: Can I borrow your broom for a bit?

1108
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:31,327
LAURA: You want to work on it? Or you want to fly
around?

1109
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:33,047
TALIESIN: It's early, I might as well.

1110
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:35,909
LAURA: Can I stand next to you while you work on
it? Would that bother you?

1111
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:38,553
TALIESIN: Only if you want to double the amount of
time it takes me to work on it.

1112
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:40,651
LAURA: Oh, Percy, I just want to see what you're
doing.

1113
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:42,153
TALIESIN: All right, it's very boring.

1114
01:09:42,153 --> 01:09:44,004
SAM: Wait, are we in the mansion or are we--

1115
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:46,669
MATT: So you guys have all walked into the mansion
at this point. Keyleth, you cast Greater

1116
01:09:46,669 --> 01:09:53,848
Restoration, and you reach out to Vax. And what
little bit of crow's-nest wrinkles, crow's feet

1117
01:09:53,848 --> 01:09:56,851
that have crawled on the side of his face, and a
little bit of the grey hairs that began to spray

1118
01:09:56,851 --> 01:10:03,079
in the side, all revert back, skin tightens, he's
back to his normal roguish

1119
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:05,150
half-elf average-aged self.

1120
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,873
LIAM: I am still older than you.

1121
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:09,088
LAURA: By like two whole minutes.

1122
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:13,319
LIAM: Which means I get to tell you what to do and
don't you forget it.

1123
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:20,518
MATT: All right, so all of you guys head into the
mansion. Vex, you're helping Percy to the

1124
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:21,520
workshop?

1125
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,457
LAURA: Yes.

1126
01:10:22,457 --> 01:10:23,805
MATT: Okay. What're you doing?

1127
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:25,494
TALIESIN: Hit dice just restore at the end of the
day, correct?

1128
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:27,450
MATT: Half of your spent hit dice is restored.

1129
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:35,520
LAURA: I pop Trinket out, of course, so he can
hang out. Shake it out. Run around, get some

1130
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,818
exercise, I feel like an asshole for keeping you
in this thing.

1131
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:44,888
MATT: (bear noises) Goes into the kitchen. All
right, so as you guys are preparing to rest for

1132
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:46,501
the evening, you head down to the workshop.

1133
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,961
TALIESIN: Yeah, just to work on the broom.

1134
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:49,779
MATT: Okay. Are you aiding?

1135
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,575
TALIESIN and LAURA: Sure.

1136
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:54,436
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check
with advantage.

1137
01:10:54,436 --> 01:10:58,155
TALIESIN: All right. Oh! With advantage. Very
nice. It's new now, I have to remember, I got a

1138
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:01,989
new number. Natural 20.

1139
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:06,589
MATT: You guys, there are other numbers between
these, by the way.

1140
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:14,941
TALIESIN: Are there? Are there? LA-New York-LA-New
York, sorry, yeah.

1141
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:17,491
MATT: Don't poke the badger, Percy.

1142
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:20,090
TALIESIN: I gave it to Ashly this week, it was
working fine.

1143
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,303
MATT: Yeah, no.

1144
01:11:21,303 --> 01:11:22,930
TALIESIN: The other Ashly.

1145
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:27,063
MATT: All right, so. You guys work the evening,
and though you were uncertain, Vex is actually a

1146
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:32,812
very quick learner and is eager to help, and so
between bringing tools at your disposal and

1147
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:39,069
helping you hold a few places properly during the
construction process, you manage to get far more

1148
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:42,790
headway than you expected in just an evening's bit
of work. You still have probably a couple of days

1149
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:47,082
of work before you can actually complete your
prototype for this and try it out, but--

1150
01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:50,035
TALIESIN: Can I at least have the tether done, or
is it still in progress?

1151
01:11:50,035 --> 01:11:51,481
MATT: The tether for?

1152
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,873
TALIESIN: For a dex save if you fall off.

1153
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:56,236
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you've gotten that enough.

1154
01:11:56,236 --> 01:12:00,682
TALIESIN: All right. Can't stabilize yet, but at
least there's a-- okay.

1155
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:05,262
MATT: Yeah. At least if there's ever a tumble
there's a tether piece that would hopefully have a

1156
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:08,006
chance of keeping the broom with you, so.

1157
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:10,887
LAURA: Percy? I feel safer already.

1158
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:15,893
TALIESIN: Excellent. Yay to a constructive day.
That was-- you're quite good at this, we should do

1159
01:12:15,893 --> 01:12:17,455
this again sometime.

1160
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:18,395
LAURA: I would love that.

1161
01:12:18,395 --> 01:12:23,272
TALIESIN: Yes, this was actually agreeable. All
right.

1162
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:27,160
TRAVIS: I'm in the training room in my sandpit
sleeping bed.

1163
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,819
MATT: Which in contemplating over the experiences
you've had, you now have access to the full Craven

1164
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,472
Edge weapon sheet.

1165
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:34,128
TRAVIS: The full one?

1166
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:35,460
ASHLEY: That's a scroll.

1167
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,610
MATT: Just so you know what it had done.

1168
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:42,415
LAURA: What it had done to you?

1169
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:45,054
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck you!

1170
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:49,002
(laughter)

1171
01:12:49,002 --> 01:12:53,520
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Okay.

1172
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,905
LAURA: Can I see, can we see it?

1173
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:55,728
TRAVIS: No.

1174
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:57,238
LAURA: Why? Come on.

1175
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:58,924
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

1176
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:01,842
ASHLEY: All I just saw was "dark aura" in really
dark letters.

1177
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:09,452
TRAVIS: No, no, I can make really good origami
now. Can I try and take out the flaming warhammer,

1178
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:10,907
the Firebrand Warhammer?

1179
01:13:10,907 --> 01:13:13,731
MATT: Yeah, you pull it out, take it, swing it
around, dust it off a bit.

1180
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,520
TRAVIS: Can I get it to light?

1181
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,557
MATT: Bursts into flames, and for a second that
warmth near your face is like an old friend coming

1182
01:13:21,557 --> 01:13:23,601
to roost for a bit.

1183
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:25,882
TRAVIS: Can you hear me?

1184
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:29,319
(laughter)

1185
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:34,810
MATT: (fire sounds)

1186
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,609
TRAVIS: The silent type. I like it.

1187
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:39,850
(laughter)

1188
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:46,524
MATT: All right. You guys all have your evening's
rest. Though it is an early evening, you manage to

1189
01:13:46,524 --> 01:13:55,607
comfortably, after a number of harrowing
experiences, recoup, recover, wake up to a grand

1190
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:57,019
chickenful breakfast.

1191
01:13:57,019 --> 01:13:58,139
MARISHA: Yeah.

1192
01:13:58,139 --> 01:13:59,530
(laughter)

1193
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,839
SAM: Chicken and eggs, everyone!

1194
01:14:00,839 --> 01:14:01,641
LAURA: Yay!

1195
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:02,734
ASHLEY: Chicken and waffles, perhaps?

1196
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:03,968
SAM: Nope, just eggs.

1197
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:05,429
ASHLEY: Oh, just eggs, okay.

1198
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:06,857
SAM: What's a waffle?

1199
01:14:06,857 --> 01:14:11,393
ASHLEY: I don't know, it's like a mishmash of
dough, the side--

1200
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:12,670
SAM: Sounds great.

1201
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:17,234
TALIESIN: Can I spend my tinkering check building
a waffle iron? I'm just kidding. I'm kind of

1202
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:19,320
kidding. I'm going to put that aside for later.

1203
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,718
MATT: Okay. Okay.

1204
01:14:20,718 --> 01:14:22,355
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm going to put that aside.

1205
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:27,560
SAM: I spent some of the morning just with a
little piece of parchment paper and a pen, just

1206
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,096
writing out something.

1207
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:37,588
MATT: Okay. All right. You guys finish your rest,
the servants are eager to send you on your way,

1208
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:41,580
should you require anything else. Otherwise, you
guys continue your journey?

1209
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,205
TALIESIN: Let's head towards the town.

1210
01:14:43,205 --> 01:14:45,103
SAM: We walk, is that what we do?

1211
01:14:45,103 --> 01:14:46,038
TALIESIN: We walk.

1212
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:48,080
SAM: What is this walking thing? It's terrible.

1213
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,811
TALIESIN: It's also very inconspicuous. I know
you're not a fan of inconspicuous, but there's

1214
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:56,659
nothing you want to be conspicu-ed by, here.

1215
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,817
MARISHA: I mean, I could mist, I could Wind Walk
us. Do we want to Wind Walk it?

1216
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:02,358
SAM: I mean, will that burn something?

1217
01:15:02,358 --> 01:15:03,761
MARISHA: My 6th-level spell.

1218
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:05,029
SAM: Let's just walk, then.

1219
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:06,428
MATT: All right. You guys walking north?

1220
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:11,208
LAURA: I float on my broom.

1221
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,840
MATT: Okay. Who's leading?

1222
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,679
LAURA: And keep an eye out in front for any sort
of problems.

1223
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,818
LIAM: Have fun, doofus!

1224
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:21,937
LAURA: Shh! Yes, I'm leading.

1225
01:15:21,937 --> 01:15:23,753
TRAVIS: This is a lot to leave off, that's a lot.

1226
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,070
MATT: Well, you know.

1227
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,430
(laughter)

1228
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,563
TRAVIS: To not have. That's a big fucking
difference.

1229
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:32,351
LAURA: Would you have kept it if you had known all
those other things? Or would you have wanted to

1230
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,766
use more of it?

1231
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:34,990
TRAVIS: You don't know.

1232
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:39,407
MATT: This is, by the way, the benefits of
Identify spells and things like that.

1233
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:40,633
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1234
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,675
TRAVIS: Oh, well, if only I'd used my Identify spell.

1235
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:47,644
MATT: But going forward, if you have something you
don't know about, you can always go to people with

1236
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,514
those abilities and be like, could you see what
the fuck this does?

1237
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:52,284
LAURA: Do any of our people have Identify?

1238
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:57,573
MARISHA: Negative. It's like a wizard thing.

1239
01:15:57,573 --> 01:15:59,154
TRAVIS: I didn't even know people could do that.

1240
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,013
MATT: Allura or Gilmore could probably do that for
you.

1241
01:16:01,013 --> 01:16:02,741
LAURA: Don't act like you know for sure.

1242
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:05,014
(laughter)

1243
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:07,142
LIAM: I know about Gilmore.

1244
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:08,695
ASHLEY: Such a twinsies.

1245
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:13,214
MATT: Aw, so good. All right, so. You guys start
heading northward, you're leading then, Vex? Make

1246
01:16:13,214 --> 01:16:18,450
a survival check. Technically in the forest, since
you're moving through.

1247
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,002
LIAM: Yeah!

1248
01:16:20,002 --> 01:16:21,520
LAURA: 26.

1249
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:28,059
MATT: Not a problem. Utilizing the backtracking of
the path you guys took through anyway, is there

1250
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:33,285
anything you want to do while you're in the
forest? Pushing through? Okay.

1251
01:16:33,285 --> 01:16:35,337
So you keep moving north--

1252
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,424
LAURA: Oh! Did you want to look for that lake, or
are you good, Grog?

1253
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:42,367
TRAVIS: Oh, right, remember there was a lake when
we were looking for the heart of a nymph?

1254
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,062
LAURA: Doesn't it lead into the Fey world? The
plane?

1255
01:16:46,062 --> 01:16:49,693
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a portal there, right? And
isn't one of the vestiges in the Fey?

1256
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:50,952
LAURA: In the Fey world?

1257
01:16:50,952 --> 01:16:51,852
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1258
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:53,741
TALIESIN: Do we want to do that first, or do we
want to deal with--

1259
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,593
LAURA: We should probably, but I do want to come
back here.

1260
01:16:56,593 --> 01:16:59,282
TALIESIN: Oh yes, of course, it'll be right, next
thing we do.

1261
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:02,855
TRAVIS: Yeah, only if it's close, otherwise I'm
good to go back to Westruun. Only if the lake was

1262
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,336
close, I don't know where it is.

1263
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:06,369
LIAM: Are you in a hurry to talk to Dad?

1264
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:07,878
LAURA: Oh.

1265
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:13,583
TALIESIN: We don't have to stop there, that's fine.

1266
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,599
LIAM: Maybe later.

1267
01:17:15,599 --> 01:17:17,405
MARISHA: I mean, do you need to talk to Dad?

1268
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:19,333
LIAM: No. We do not need to talk to Dad.

1269
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:22,687
LAURA: Let's go to Westruun!

1270
01:17:22,687 --> 01:17:24,205
TALIESIN: Westruun it is!

1271
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:25,589
LIAM: Sore spot.

1272
01:17:25,589 --> 01:17:28,660
MATT: Continuing pushing forward, I'd like you all
to make a stealth check.

1273
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,213
(something clatters offscreen)

1274
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:31,415
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1275
01:17:31,415 --> 01:17:33,856
(laughter)

1276
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:36,936
SAM: Someone just failed it. Pike!

1277
01:17:36,936 --> 01:17:42,202
MATT: With disadvantage, Pike.

1278
01:17:42,202 --> 01:17:43,721
ASHLEY: Disadvantage? Okay.

1279
01:17:43,721 --> 01:17:46,039
TRAVIS: I'm still there, right? No, we took a long
rest!

1280
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:48,107
MATT: Yeah, you're fine, you're no longer
exhausted.

1281
01:17:48,107 --> 01:17:49,546
TRAVIS: 28.

1282
01:17:49,546 --> 01:17:51,062
ASHLEY: Can I put on my Boots of Levitation?

1283
01:17:51,062 --> 01:17:53,282
SAM, LIAM, and MATT: Too late.

1284
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:55,155
ASHLEY: I rolled a six.

1285
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:57,853
TRAVIS: Yeah, she's back!

1286
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:03,022
ASHLEY: Pike is back! What would it be without
some clanging?

1287
01:18:03,022 --> 01:18:09,459
MATT: So as you guys are making your way across
the path, keeping as quiet as you can, Pike,

1288
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:14,446
you're starting to fall behind a little bit, and
in trying to catch up, you get a run on before you

1289
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:22,387
start to hear this (hiss) out of the side of the
forest, and you see a deep blue scaled-looking

1290
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:27,871
lizard entity. You see in the distance a basilisk
that's coming over the ridge.

1291
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:29,151
MARISHA: Oh, again.

1292
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:32,138
TALIESIN: I wouldn't have let her get that far
back, I would've been hanging back there too.

1293
01:18:32,138 --> 01:18:36,596
MATT: Okay, then you're hanging with her and you
see this as well, what are you guys doing? It's

1294
01:18:36,596 --> 01:18:38,592
about, it's about 30, 40 feet off.

1295
01:18:38,592 --> 01:18:39,953
TALIESIN: How big is it?

1296
01:18:39,953 --> 01:18:40,979
MARISHA: Should we run?

1297
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:45,102
MATT: It's the same size as the other ones,
they're about five and a half, six feet from nose

1298
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:47,726
to back end.

1299
01:18:47,726 --> 01:18:53,377
TRAVIS: Let's run. I pick up Pike, I put her on my
shoulder, and we run.

1300
01:18:53,377 --> 01:18:58,217
MATT: Okay. First off, Pike, I need you to go
ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

1301
01:18:58,217 --> 01:18:59,850
LAURA: Aw, because you saw it.

1302
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,773
MATT: You glanced over and saw it before you
realized.

1303
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:03,202
ASHLEY: I don't think I did, though.

1304
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,393
(laughter)

1305
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:09,535
ASHLEY: Oh! I got 19.

1306
01:19:09,535 --> 01:19:15,282
MATT: 19, okay. Just the instinctual glance at it,
you're like, oh crap, and you feel the impact of

1307
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:23,291
its gaze. However, you're a fairly hardy gnome and
you resist the creeping stone-based enchantment.

1308
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:28,376
As you begin to run forward, Percy pushes behind
you as Grog rushes forward, both of you guys

1309
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:32,303
recognizing that sound and averting your gaze,
pick up Pike and you all begin charging forward.

1310
01:19:32,303 --> 01:19:39,171
As you do, you can hear the hiss behind you
gathered by a second one. (hissing) And the sounds

1311
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:45,667
of many feet charging through the snow quickly. I
would like you guys all to go ahead and, we'll say

1312
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:51,312
for the sake of this, just roll dexterity checks.
Or no, athletics. This would be your run speed on

1313
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:52,672
this one, sorry.

1314
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:54,498
LAURA: What if I'm on the broom, though?

1315
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:58,181
MATT: If you're on the broom, you don't have to
worry about it, you're not exerting energy to

1316
01:19:58,181 --> 01:19:59,759
maintain a pace.

1317
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:01,435
Athletics.

1318
01:20:01,435 --> 01:20:02,595
TRAVIS: 24.

1319
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:03,560
ASHLEY: 19.

1320
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,509
LIAM: 30.

1321
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:05,331
MARISHA: Ten.

1322
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:06,209
TALIESIN: Ten.

1323
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:07,158
SAM: 11.

1324
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:12,838
MATT: Okay. You guys all manage to maintain a
fairly decent pace; these creatures are fairly

1325
01:20:12,838 --> 01:20:21,126
quick and as they begin to catch up, you begin to
use your guidance as a person who knows the forest

1326
01:20:21,126 --> 01:20:26,350
fairly well to begin ducking in and out of areas,
using snowbanks at your disposal. At one point,

1327
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:30,589
Grog, you see a partially broken old dying tree
that you just go ahead and grab and throw behind

1328
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:32,835
you. Make a strength check?

1329
01:20:32,835 --> 01:20:37,810
TRAVIS: 21.

1330
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:46,093
MATT: 21. With one hand you grab it and, boom, the
actual trunk, old and long-rotted, snaps and falls

1331
01:20:46,093 --> 01:20:52,089
behind you with a large impact. You believe from
the sound of it, it at least hit or halted one of

1332
01:20:52,089 --> 01:20:57,854
them for a short time, it's just a (snarl) sound.
And as you guys continue pushing forward towards

1333
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:02,439
the northern side of this forest, the sound of the
hissing begins to slowly subside as you dodge back

1334
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:08,074
and forth, zigzagging across this pathway.
Eventually you guys, over about an additional hour

1335
01:21:08,074 --> 01:21:12,982
and a half of pushing forward, you hear, and have
not heard any following hissing sound for a while,

1336
01:21:12,982 --> 01:21:18,955
and eventually see before you the outside of the
Frostweald Forest finally approaching. With that,

1337
01:21:18,955 --> 01:21:24,956
you guys push through the last elements of this
frozen forest, back into the fields heading

1338
01:21:24,956 --> 01:21:29,948
northward towards Westruun proper. With that,
we're going to take a quick break.

1339
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:31,837
(cheering)

1340
01:21:31,837 --> 01:21:36,308
MATT: So yeah, we're going to go ahead and take a
little trip here to the restroom, we'll

1341
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,637
see you guys here in a few minutes to continue the
next length of this journey.

1342
01:21:38,637 --> 01:21:40,310
TRAVIS: We get to play that shit again,
right?

1343
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,131
LIAM: Why did it get so scary?

1344
01:21:42,131 --> 01:35:48,045
[break]

1345
01:35:48,045 --> 01:35:56,432
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. So. Returning
from-- Stop dying. Returning from that harrowing

1346
01:35:56,432 --> 01:36:05,005
endeavor, you continue your trek northward toward
Westruun. It is a few days' travel to make your

1347
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:11,412
way, a little over two days, I think, from where
the Frostweald is, you can stop and pass by the

1348
01:36:11,412 --> 01:36:14,537
camp at the lake if you wish to, or continue
pressing forward, it's up to you.

1349
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:18,888
MARISHA: Well, we should probably stop by and tell
them that their problem has been handled.

1350
01:36:18,888 --> 01:36:22,957
TALIESIN: We could stop by later and tell them
that both their problems have been handled.

1351
01:36:22,957 --> 01:36:28,008
MARISHA: Why can't we stop by now? They're right
here, we might as well pop in. We'll forget if we

1352
01:36:28,008 --> 01:36:33,552
don't do it now. I know us. It'll be three months
before we come back, and then we'll be like, by

1353
01:36:33,552 --> 01:36:34,470
the way--

1354
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:37,054
LAURA: No, we're coming back soon because we're
going into the Feywild.

1355
01:36:37,054 --> 01:36:39,241
TALIESIN: Well, they know their problem's been
handled because we sent

1356
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:40,747
all their people back to them.

1357
01:36:40,747 --> 01:36:46,157
MARISHA: Let's just talk to them real fast. Okay.
We pop in, we're like, hey.

1358
01:36:46,157 --> 01:36:47,747
LAURA: I think Keyleth wants a reward.

1359
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:55,779
MATT: You guys stop by the Foramere Basin, where
you originally saw the encampment of some of the

1360
01:36:55,779 --> 01:37:02,018
survivors of the Westruun incursion by the Chroma
Conclave. As you approach, some of the guards

1361
01:37:02,018 --> 01:37:05,836
immediately come up, crossbows up, when they
notice who it was before previously, they lower

1362
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:11,297
their weapons and one of the guards comes forward,
approaches you, saying, "Good to see that you've

1363
01:37:11,297 --> 01:37:21,142
"returned. We've managed to also acquire our
recently captured individuals, most at least have

1364
01:37:21,142 --> 01:37:26,286
"come back safely, it's appreciated. If you wish to
talk to Cornelius, well, he should be up and

1365
01:37:26,286 --> 01:37:33,764
"about. I'll take you." Leads you guys into the
camp. As you find your way in, folks around you

1366
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:38,918
tend to stop again and watch you quietly as you
pass, a few with smiles, and you see a few people

1367
01:37:38,918 --> 01:37:43,521
wave and say, thank you. And you do see a couple
of individuals that you did help escape from the

1368
01:37:43,521 --> 01:37:46,921
orc encampment, they themselves are still on the
mend, a lot of them were fairly brutalized when

1369
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:53,411
they were there, but the same child that you found
in the tent just runs up and gives a big ol' hug

1370
01:37:53,411 --> 01:38:02,526
to Vex and holds you for a second, then lets go
and runs back off to her mother. You're led back

1371
01:38:02,526 --> 01:38:07,159
to the tent where Cornelius originally met with
you guys, but Cornelius is outside of the tent

1372
01:38:07,159 --> 01:38:11,825
right now, just in the process of cutting firewood
that's going to be used for the firepits later on.

1373
01:38:11,825 --> 01:38:15,212
LAURA: Where'd he find the wood? I thought there
were no trees around.

1374
01:38:15,212 --> 01:38:19,469
MATT: You imagine that they don't go to other
nearby wooded areas and cut them down?

1375
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:22,413
TRAVIS: Yeah, poke the DM.

1376
01:38:22,413 --> 01:38:24,168
(glass shatters offscreen)

1377
01:38:24,168 --> 01:38:25,431
LIAM: Oh dear.

1378
01:38:25,431 --> 01:38:28,697
MATT: And that's what happens.

1379
01:38:28,697 --> 01:38:30,607
(laughter)

1380
01:38:30,607 --> 01:38:34,336
MATT: You think that was an accident.

1381
01:38:34,336 --> 01:38:37,708
TALIESIN: When you're in 50 episodes, this is the
first one.

1382
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:40,767
MARISHA: This is the first one. It's like that
scene in the second Matrix.

1383
01:38:40,767 --> 01:38:50,308
MATT: Let's not remember the second Matrix.
Cornelius is there. What little bit of timber

1384
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:58,926
they've managed to scavenge or find from local
wooded areas, Cornelius sits there, wipes his

1385
01:38:58,926 --> 01:39:04,474
brow, his sleeves rolled up. "Oh. Hold on just a
second."

1386
01:39:04,474 --> 01:39:12,128
He puts his axe down and walks over, wipes his
hands. "Well, you're true to your word. And for

1387
01:39:12,128 --> 01:39:18,717
"that I'm real appreciative. You did us a real
favor and brought back some good people

1388
01:39:18,717 --> 01:39:20,691
"alive and intact."

1389
01:39:20,691 --> 01:39:23,051
SAM: Did your brother make it back safely?

1390
01:39:23,051 --> 01:39:28,111
MATT: "Cyrus did and I certainly had a very stern
talking-to to that boy. But I--"

1391
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:33,365
SAM: Don't go too hard on him, he was being held
up by a rope and tortured by a bunch of monsters.

1392
01:39:33,365 --> 01:39:35,752
LAURA: Pretty traumatizing, I would assume.

1393
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:43,083
MATT: (laughs) "That would be him, wouldn't it?
Well, nevertheless, I appreciate it. Looks like

1394
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:50,091
"through some talks we might be able to bring most
of us into Kymal for the time being. It's the town

1395
01:39:50,091 --> 01:39:56,044
"to the west of here. It's small, it's cramped, but
we figure at least that's better than being out

1396
01:39:56,044 --> 01:40:00,312
"here in the open. And we have numbers there, so
we'll be a little more protected."

1397
01:40:00,312 --> 01:40:04,134
TALIESIN: Well, that's where we'll send word if
anything happens in Westruun.

1398
01:40:04,134 --> 01:40:05,453
LAURA: Yes.

1399
01:40:05,453 --> 01:40:07,059
MATT: "Heading to Westruun yourself, now?"

1400
01:40:07,059 --> 01:40:08,694
MARISHA: It's next on the list.

1401
01:40:08,694 --> 01:40:14,314
LAURA: If all goes well, you may be able-- no, I
don't know.

1402
01:40:14,314 --> 01:40:17,302
TALIESIN: Let's not make promises.

1403
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:19,054
LAURA and MARISHA: Dragons.

1404
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:20,929
LAURA: It may be a while, but we're trying.

1405
01:40:20,929 --> 01:40:31,023
MATT: "Well, I wish you all the best of luck.
Yeah. Figure if anyone could do it, it'd probably

1406
01:40:31,023 --> 01:40:39,267
"be you folk. Well. I look forward to hearing from
your victorious recovery of our homestead, and

1407
01:40:39,267 --> 01:40:42,481
"I'll get the first round when we come back to our
town."

1408
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:45,893
MARISHA: Farewell, Cornelius.

1409
01:40:45,893 --> 01:40:50,607
MATT: "Stay safe." He turns around and grabs his
axe again and starts chopping through the wood

1410
01:40:50,607 --> 01:40:51,956
once more.

1411
01:40:51,956 --> 01:40:53,668
LAURA: Was there anything else you wanted to do,
Keyleth?

1412
01:40:53,668 --> 01:40:55,013
MARISHA: No, I'm good.

1413
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,124
LAURA: All right.

1414
01:40:56,124 --> 01:41:00,306
SAM: Do we need to check in with Drez? No, we know
what he wants.

1415
01:41:00,306 --> 01:41:01,551
LIAM: Fuck Drez.

1416
01:41:01,551 --> 01:41:03,699
MARISHA: That guy's a weasel.

1417
01:41:03,699 --> 01:41:05,699
SAM: We have his Hunk of Quall.

1418
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:14,269
MARISHA: That was a gift, I'm pretty sure. It's a
loaner, it's on loan for the foreseeable future

1419
01:41:14,269 --> 01:41:16,261
until we save the world.

1420
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:19,704
ASHLEY: Mr. Vina. Mr. Drez Vina.

1421
01:41:19,704 --> 01:41:25,037
MATT: Drez Vina, who is the assistant to Master
Quall. Who is the one that originally hired you.

1422
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:28,620
And by the fact that he called a debt on the
initial enchanted ruby that you used on your first

1423
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,699
endeavor, yeah, you get the feeling that whatever
this object is that he gave you,

1424
01:41:31,699 --> 01:41:33,267
it's probably on loan.

1425
01:41:33,267 --> 01:41:34,769
ASHLEY: (coughs)

1426
01:41:34,769 --> 01:41:36,632
TRAVIS: Pike! Are you all right?

1427
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,929
SAM: Heal her!

1428
01:41:37,929 --> 01:41:39,632
MATT: So you guys continue forward into Westruun?

1429
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:41,694
SAM: To Westruun. And what is our mission?

1430
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:43,835
LAURA: Okay, what are we, what's our plan here,
Grog?

1431
01:41:43,835 --> 01:41:44,816
TRAVIS: What time is it?

1432
01:41:44,816 --> 01:41:50,714
MATT: You guys have traveled for one day, you've
gone into the evening, you can take a rest here

1433
01:41:50,714 --> 01:41:56,428
or, you know, rest within your mansion on the
outskirts of this encampment before it roots up

1434
01:41:56,428 --> 01:42:02,256
and starts heading back to Kymal relatively soon.
You guys then, the next morning, can continue your

1435
01:42:02,256 --> 01:42:05,722
trek northward, and you can probably get to
Westruun by the end of day, if you travel quickly

1436
01:42:05,722 --> 01:42:07,353
and consistently.

1437
01:42:07,353 --> 01:42:12,325
LAURA: What do you think, Grog, what do you want
to do? Walk right into town?

1438
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:21,062
TRAVIS: No. No. I like what Percy said, I think
there's worth in being clever.

1439
01:42:21,062 --> 01:42:23,786
TALIESIN: I would agree.

1440
01:42:23,786 --> 01:42:31,196
TRAVIS: I would actually like to maybe run some
ideas by you. We don't walk into town, but we have

1441
01:42:31,196 --> 01:42:33,095
the town walk out to us.

1442
01:42:33,095 --> 01:42:35,930
SAM: How do we do that?

1443
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:38,243
TALIESIN: Oh, there's many ways we could do that.

1444
01:42:38,243 --> 01:42:42,555
TRAVIS: Well, look, so there are people in there
that are innocents, right, we told the farmer we'd

1445
01:42:42,555 --> 01:42:51,162
get his people back and I really want to see if
Wilhand's all right. So listen. How do you feel

1446
01:42:51,162 --> 01:42:56,039
about sending someone in that would draw out their
worst?

1447
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:06,506
TALIESIN: I think we could draw out their worst
very easily. Hmm. How committed are your people to

1448
01:43:06,506 --> 01:43:08,131
trial by combat?

1449
01:43:08,131 --> 01:43:10,587
TRAVIS: Oh, it's about all we do.

1450
01:43:10,587 --> 01:43:14,415
TALIESIN: What can you imagine would be the most
exciting show they could possibly hope for?

1451
01:43:14,415 --> 01:43:16,954
LAURA: A rematch, I would think.

1452
01:43:16,954 --> 01:43:23,109
TRAVIS: Well, it wasn't really an official fight,
it was more of like a one-sided ass-whooping.

1453
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:25,205
LAURA: But they think you're dead.

1454
01:43:25,205 --> 01:43:35,013
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're going to get to that later. I
was thinking maybe we could set a fire and send

1455
01:43:35,013 --> 01:43:40,052
someone running in and say there's a roving band
of orcs that are challenging the goliaths, and

1456
01:43:40,052 --> 01:43:44,737
then when they come out and leave we can move into
the town and get all the innocents out. And then

1457
01:43:44,737 --> 01:43:53,310
if we want, we could set a trap, or an ambush, or
we could play some mind games, but I want to try

1458
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,579
and get the town clear first.

1459
01:43:55,579 --> 01:44:00,370
SAM: You know, your people might not be the
brightest, but they're not going to send everybody

1460
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:02,204
out to meet these orcs.

1461
01:44:02,204 --> 01:44:04,236
TRAVIS: No no no no. Just a few.

1462
01:44:04,236 --> 01:44:06,319
MARISHA: And probably not Kevdak.

1463
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:12,714
TRAVIS: Well, look, if it's not Kevdak, we get a
practice round on those that do come out.

1464
01:44:12,714 --> 01:44:18,315
MARISHA: Well, here's my question: there's got to
be hundreds of people still left in Westruun. It

1465
01:44:18,315 --> 01:44:23,628
could take hours to evacuate a city of that size.

1466
01:44:23,628 --> 01:44:27,202
TRAVIS: Well, so you know how last time when we
went over there and Horace was just outside the

1467
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:32,796
city walls? I'm pretty sure if we wait for a bit,
somebody will come out, we take him, we mess him

1468
01:44:32,796 --> 01:44:37,592
up real good, maybe take his tongue out, chop off
his arms, and then send him back in.

1469
01:44:37,592 --> 01:44:39,217
TALIESIN: Some of that is...

1470
01:44:39,217 --> 01:44:46,809
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm open to augmenting that plan a
little bit.

1471
01:44:46,809 --> 01:44:49,224
SAM: I could make you look like an orc or
something.

1472
01:44:49,224 --> 01:44:53,383
TRAVIS: No, like I said before, if I go in
there--

1473
01:44:53,383 --> 01:44:58,237
SAM: No no no, just to rough up the guy that we
send back in to tell them about the orcs.

1474
01:44:58,237 --> 01:45:01,508
TRAVIS: I'll hold him while somebody else can
rough him up, but--

1475
01:45:01,508 --> 01:45:03,340
TALIESIN: How smart are your people?

1476
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:06,132
TRAVIS: Well, pretty smart, they're all like me.

1477
01:45:06,132 --> 01:45:07,322
LAURA: As smart as you?

1478
01:45:07,322 --> 01:45:09,161
TRAVIS: Yeah, scholars the lot.

1479
01:45:09,161 --> 01:45:18,401
MARISHA: Grog. If someone kills Kevdak, say
hypothetically you, who takes control of the Herd

1480
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:19,828
after that?

1481
01:45:19,828 --> 01:45:23,443
TRAVIS: Well, my math is a little shoddy, but I
think that would be me.

1482
01:45:23,443 --> 01:45:28,460
MARISHA: Well then, why do we need to evacuate the
city if you could theoretically have control over it?

1483
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:32,907
LIAM: If we could figure out where Kevdak is and
drop in on that point.

1484
01:45:32,907 --> 01:45:34,418
LAURA: Well, he's in the mayor's--

1485
01:45:34,418 --> 01:45:41,648
LIAM: Yeah. And handle Kevdak before the rest of
the city can descend upon us. It's a gamble, but

1486
01:45:41,648 --> 01:45:43,469
so is everything we do.

1487
01:45:43,469 --> 01:45:49,571
LAURA: Yeah, but if the city, if the rest of them
don't see him defeating Kevdak, then it's

1488
01:45:49,571 --> 01:45:51,830
worthless. They need to watch it happen.

1489
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:56,787
LIAM: Well, how honorable are your people, if you
fell Kevdak or whatever the fuck his name is, will

1490
01:45:56,787 --> 01:45:58,630
the rest stand down?

1491
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:11,150
TRAVIS: Maybe, but-- (sighs) So, here it is. My
whole life has been wanting to punish or get back

1492
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:22,621
at Kevdak. I don't want to do it cheaply, I don't
want to do it quickly. I want to do it with my own

1493
01:46:22,621 --> 01:46:36,225
hands. Now, I'll do it with my family, do it with
my buddy Pike, but I want it done right.

1494
01:46:36,225 --> 01:46:46,412
TALIESIN: I've got a thought. It's dangerous, but
I have a thought. You literally walk, march right

1495
01:46:46,412 --> 01:46:49,628
to the city gates and demand a challenge.

1496
01:46:49,628 --> 01:46:55,408
MARISHA: I have a feeling you're going to be the
most attractive bait that we can think of.

1497
01:46:55,408 --> 01:47:00,916
TALIESIN: If we put you right in front there,
perhaps we let Pike stay with you, I doubt there's

1498
01:47:00,916 --> 01:47:07,966
any of them who will not want to watch that. And
while they're watching, the rest of us do our best

1499
01:47:07,966 --> 01:47:10,214
to get everybody as safe as possible.

1500
01:47:10,214 --> 01:47:13,042
LAURA: But what's to keep Grog safe in the
meantime?

1501
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:17,402
TALIESIN: They won't want to sully that fight, no
one will want to sully that fight.

1502
01:47:17,402 --> 01:47:19,746
TRAVIS: No, I can guarantee you, no one will
interfere.

1503
01:47:19,746 --> 01:47:21,311
TALIESIN: And if things get bad--

1504
01:47:21,311 --> 01:47:23,339
MARISHA: We'll be nearby.

1505
01:47:23,339 --> 01:47:24,719
TALIESIN: We'll pull him out.

1506
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:25,951
TRAVIS: I like that.

1507
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:30,915
LAURA: I don't want to abandon Grog to a fight
with Kevdak while we're freeing villagers. No

1508
01:47:30,915 --> 01:47:34,261
offense to them. I want to have Grog's back.

1509
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:35,649
LIAM: I agree with that.

1510
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:41,028
MARISHA: I think we won't need to worry about
freeing the villagers if we can defeat Kevdak.

1511
01:47:41,028 --> 01:47:44,325
LAURA: What if we stay hidden?

1512
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:51,271
TRAVIS: Oh, wait a minute. Right, so they think
I'm dead.

1513
01:47:51,271 --> 01:47:52,982
LAURA: Yeah.

1514
01:47:52,982 --> 01:47:57,955
TRAVIS: Maybe I let them think I conquered death.

1515
01:47:57,955 --> 01:47:59,915
LAURA: Which you kind of did, Grog.

1516
01:47:59,915 --> 01:48:05,893
TRAVIS: Maybe we let them think that I'm not the
same Grog I was before. Maybe we let them think

1517
01:48:05,893 --> 01:48:08,788
I've gained abilities.

1518
01:48:08,788 --> 01:48:11,019
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure all those things are
actually true.

1519
01:48:11,019 --> 01:48:12,679
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, but I mean like--

1520
01:48:12,679 --> 01:48:14,173
SAM: Yeah, yeah, make a show of it a bit.

1521
01:48:14,173 --> 01:48:17,670
TRAVIS: Yeah. But they don't have to see where
those abilities come from.

1522
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,595
MARISHA: Sure.

1523
01:48:18,595 --> 01:48:21,861
TRAVIS: All they've got to see is me. There are
roofs, right, I mean it's like two- and

1524
01:48:21,861 --> 01:48:23,785
three-story buildings all in that city.

1525
01:48:23,785 --> 01:48:25,164
ASHLEY: It just makes me so nervous.

1526
01:48:25,164 --> 01:48:27,661
LAURA: So wait, we stay hidden and you call
lightning.

1527
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:33,392
TRAVIS: Yeah. You guys get all up on the roofs
while I'm making a scene in the middle and we pull

1528
01:48:33,392 --> 01:48:35,843
off the greatest stage show there's ever been.

1529
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:37,697
SAM: I love a good stage show.

1530
01:48:37,697 --> 01:48:39,382
ASHLEY: This is not a bad idea.

1531
01:48:39,382 --> 01:48:43,579
MARISHA: We can make you look as cool as you want.
That's undeniable.

1532
01:48:43,579 --> 01:48:45,447
TRAVIS: If I do a pelvic thrust, will you do
your--

1533
01:48:45,447 --> 01:48:48,367
SAM: I will grant you cock lightning.

1534
01:48:48,367 --> 01:48:49,919
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1535
01:48:49,919 --> 01:48:55,728
"I will grant you cock lightning."

1536
01:48:55,728 --> 01:48:58,913
LIAM: Weirdest production of Grease ever.

1537
01:48:58,913 --> 01:49:03,465
TALIESIN: How many objects are you attuned to
right now?

1538
01:49:03,465 --> 01:49:05,597
TRAVIS: Three.

1539
01:49:05,597 --> 01:49:08,198
SAM: If he could unattune to one, we can put him
in the Hat of Disguise.

1540
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:10,490
TRAVIS: I don't want it.

1541
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:12,795
TALIESIN: What do you have right now?

1542
01:49:12,795 --> 01:49:16,193
TRAVIS: I have the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength.

1543
01:49:16,193 --> 01:49:17,437
TALIESIN: That's good.

1544
01:49:17,437 --> 01:49:19,693
TRAVIS: I have the flaming--

1545
01:49:19,693 --> 01:49:20,948
LAURA: Warhammer?

1546
01:49:20,948 --> 01:49:21,995
TRAVIS: Yup.

1547
01:49:21,995 --> 01:49:23,202
TALIESIN: That's good.

1548
01:49:23,202 --> 01:49:27,207
TRAVIS: And the belt. What's the other? Oh, and
my--

1549
01:49:27,207 --> 01:49:31,682
LAURA: You gained the ability to grow a beard in
the afterlife. It's pretty major.

1550
01:49:31,682 --> 01:49:36,475
MATT: Well, you have three of those, so you have
to get rid of the necklace.

1551
01:49:36,475 --> 01:49:38,587
TRAVIS: Actually, the flaming warhammer's not
attuned.

1552
01:49:38,587 --> 01:49:41,828
MATT: Oh, that's right. That's true, no, you're
good.

1553
01:49:41,828 --> 01:49:45,793
TALIESIN: What does the amulet do?

1554
01:49:45,793 --> 01:49:47,903
TRAVIS: It gives me plus two to my AC.

1555
01:49:47,903 --> 01:49:49,248
MARISHA: Pretty nice.

1556
01:49:49,248 --> 01:49:51,059
TALIESIN: That's pretty nice.

1557
01:49:51,059 --> 01:49:58,162
SAM: And so the object of this would be to stall,
to enthrall, to captivate them as long as you can,

1558
01:49:58,162 --> 01:50:02,883
keep talking to them, not engage in fights for as
long as possible while we--

1559
01:50:02,883 --> 01:50:07,889
TRAVIS: Get in place. I mean, I could try and do
it while you're getting the hostages out, or we

1560
01:50:07,889 --> 01:50:09,820
could just take down the snake's head.

1561
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:12,450
TALIESIN: We need his Knuckles.

1562
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:13,854
LAURA: Kill Kevdak.

1563
01:50:13,854 --> 01:50:19,167
SAM: Yeah, but is Kevdak going to engage in a
fight with a magical Grog? That's not a fair

1564
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:20,127
fight, is it?

1565
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:21,215
LAURA: It's a pride issue.

1566
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:22,592
ASHLEY: I think he will.

1567
01:50:22,592 --> 01:50:25,561
TRAVIS: I do know how to get his pride in check.

1568
01:50:25,561 --> 01:50:29,057
LAURA: Grog, would you engage in a fight with a
magical being who wronged you, if you thought you

1569
01:50:29,057 --> 01:50:30,422
were better than him?

1570
01:50:30,422 --> 01:50:32,029
TRAVIS: Why, who said something?

1571
01:50:32,029 --> 01:50:37,692
SAM: And when they discover, and they surely will,
that you are not magical and that your friends are

1572
01:50:37,692 --> 01:50:40,471
aiding you, will that bring you great shame?

1573
01:50:40,471 --> 01:50:50,881
TRAVIS: No. No, I made a choice. This is my
family. My old family left me to die.

1574
01:50:50,881 --> 01:50:57,856
MARISHA: Plus, I mean, it's like wearing really
cool robes. Right, Scanlan? You know, there's

1575
01:50:57,856 --> 01:51:00,428
nothing wrong with wanting to look cool.

1576
01:51:00,428 --> 01:51:06,722
SAM: I don't know about wanting to look cool, it
just comes naturally.

1577
01:51:06,722 --> 01:51:09,453
ASHLEY: Let's make sure that it doesn't happen,
that they won't know.

1578
01:51:09,453 --> 01:51:11,225
LAURA: Nice beret there, Scanlan.

1579
01:51:11,225 --> 01:51:13,860
TALIESIN: This is going to end with a fight
between the two of you, there's no denying that.

1580
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,843
LIAM: Anyway, Kevdak's using a gift of the gods.

1581
01:51:15,843 --> 01:51:16,981
TALIESIN: Yes.

1582
01:51:16,981 --> 01:51:19,295
LAURA: That's right! He's full of shit.

1583
01:51:19,295 --> 01:51:27,557
ASHLEY: These are very scary people, you guys.
They left him in a very horrible state and I would

1584
01:51:27,557 --> 01:51:29,706
not like to see that again.

1585
01:51:29,706 --> 01:51:31,420
MARISHA: But that was years ago!

1586
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:35,234
TALIESIN: We defeated the people who left me in a
horrible state, I think we will have no problem

1587
01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:37,003
defeating the people who left him.

1588
01:51:37,003 --> 01:51:39,060
LIAM: We have a gift of the gods and soon we will
have many more.

1589
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:46,150
SAM: So you do intend to engage in a fight.
Because otherwise I would say, I can go in, just

1590
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:50,074
sort of looking like you, and draw their
attention.

1591
01:51:50,074 --> 01:51:51,288
TALIESIN: And then what?

1592
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:52,691
SAM: And then bamf outta there.

1593
01:51:52,691 --> 01:51:53,774
TALIESIN: But then what?

1594
01:51:53,774 --> 01:51:55,644
SAM: Or run away and draw them with me.

1595
01:51:55,644 --> 01:51:57,231
TALIESIN: How does that save the city?

1596
01:51:57,231 --> 01:51:58,812
SAM: It gets them to follow me.

1597
01:51:58,812 --> 01:52:05,100
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, and either way, I like that
because either way, if only the pawns of the group

1598
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:11,140
follow him out? That's fewer goliaths we have to
worry about. Best-case scenario, Kevdak, Zanror,

1599
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:17,323
and the best of the baddies chase him out, we can
get the hostages out, and then set the trap for

1600
01:52:17,323 --> 01:52:18,665
when they come back.

1601
01:52:18,665 --> 01:52:21,964
TALIESIN: It's not just the hostages, though, it's
a city under siege. I just don't think it's

1602
01:52:21,964 --> 01:52:23,617
feasible to empty it.

1603
01:52:23,617 --> 01:52:29,237
MARISHA: Right, but you have to remember it's--
right, yes, pretty much. What you said. It's a

1604
01:52:29,237 --> 01:52:37,142
city under siege, under siege, it's meta under
siege, under siege from the goliaths and then

1605
01:52:37,142 --> 01:52:38,647
again from the dragons.

1606
01:52:38,647 --> 01:52:41,138
TALIESIN: They're in a place, though, where if we
can get rid of the goliaths, at least they could

1607
01:52:41,138 --> 01:52:42,969
function with the dragons.

1608
01:52:42,969 --> 01:52:46,906
LAURA: And if we remove all of the villagers,
it'll definitely gain the attention of the

1609
01:52:46,906 --> 01:52:48,035
dragons.

1610
01:52:48,035 --> 01:52:49,257
MARISHA: That's true.

1611
01:52:49,257 --> 01:52:51,801
TRAVIS: Will it? I thought they only fly over
every few days.

1612
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:54,759
MARISHA: They have wyverns who have been running
patrol.

1613
01:52:54,759 --> 01:52:56,552
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Not over Westruun.

1614
01:52:56,552 --> 01:52:58,789
MARISHA: But we haven't been hanging out over
Westruun.

1615
01:52:58,789 --> 01:53:06,953
TRAVIS: If there are no wyverns, are you open to
the idea of gerbil-ball Scanlan doing a thing?

1616
01:53:06,953 --> 01:53:11,911
MARISHA: No, not at all. But that's actually not a
bad idea. We're still outside the camp, right?

1617
01:53:11,911 --> 01:53:16,449
How about this: why don't we hike to the
outskirts of Westruun, camp out the rest of the

1618
01:53:16,449 --> 01:53:19,677
evening, keep an eye out, and just scout for a
little bit?

1619
01:53:19,677 --> 01:53:24,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, and if we get close, hopefully we
can ask somebody that's nice if they've seen any

1620
01:53:24,608 --> 01:53:26,413
dragons and how long it's been since.

1621
01:53:26,474 --> 01:53:27,486
LAURA: Yeah.

1622
01:53:27,486 --> 01:53:30,510
LIAM: Well, we probably want to set up shop for a
while and wait for the dragons to come and leave

1623
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:33,093
and then strike, so that we've got some time.

1624
01:53:33,093 --> 01:53:34,296
TALIESIN: Very clever.

1625
01:53:34,296 --> 01:53:35,687
TRAVIS: That's brilliant.

1626
01:53:35,687 --> 01:53:41,989
LIAM: We use fake shithead Grog. Sorry. Fake
shitheadier Grog to create a scene and run off and

1627
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:48,556
draw away some of the goliaths, probably not
Kevdak, and then you go in for the main event with

1628
01:53:48,556 --> 01:53:50,212
a thinned-out Herd.

1629
01:53:50,212 --> 01:53:52,393
TRAVIS: Yep. I like it.

1630
01:53:52,393 --> 01:53:57,525
MARISHA: I can be on the roofs nearby along with
Vex and Percy doing range.

1631
01:53:57,525 --> 01:54:04,776
LAURA: What if we do the same thing that those
orcs did? When you go in and cause a distraction

1632
01:54:04,776 --> 01:54:09,541
and lead them out, we spend the few days that
we're waiting for the dragons to build a massive

1633
01:54:09,541 --> 01:54:14,972
trench, you can use Move Earth, and lead them all
out over something and drop a Herd of goliaths.

1634
01:54:14,972 --> 01:54:19,601
MARISHA: And I can do the Hallucinatory Terrain
thing again. It has been a while.

1635
01:54:19,601 --> 01:54:22,567
LAURA: Drop them into a trench, they're stuck in
there while he fights Kevdak.

1636
01:54:22,567 --> 01:54:25,260
MARISHA: And I do love using that spell.

1637
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:26,980
TRAVIS: I'm game.

1638
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:28,090
ASHLEY: I like this idea.

1639
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:30,377
SAM: It still doesn't solve one question.

1640
01:54:30,377 --> 01:54:31,647
TRAVIS: What's that?

1641
01:54:31,647 --> 01:54:36,975
SAM: I love you, but can you beat Kevdak without
magic and friends?

1642
01:54:36,975 --> 01:54:45,069
TRAVIS: I mean, look, we're going to find out one
way or the other. I don't know. But look.

1643
01:54:45,069 --> 01:54:46,532
LAURA: Can we aid you?

1644
01:54:46,532 --> 01:54:47,557
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1645
01:54:47,557 --> 01:54:49,658
LAURA: This isn't like the Crucible.

1646
01:54:49,658 --> 01:54:57,000
TRAVIS: No, look, he's wearing weapons given by a
god. I don't care if it's a totally fair fight, I

1647
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,244
just don't want to dispatch him cheaply.

1648
01:54:59,244 --> 01:55:00,902
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: All right.

1649
01:55:00,902 --> 01:55:03,160
TALIESIN: We can do this. We've got lightning.

1650
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,901
LIAM: That's very intelligent of you, Grog.

1651
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:09,531
SAM: That means good.

1652
01:55:09,531 --> 01:55:11,297
LAURA: Smart.

1653
01:55:11,297 --> 01:55:13,683
TRAVIS: Oh. Thank you.

1654
01:55:13,683 --> 01:55:16,163
TALIESIN: Let's rest up and wait for the dragons.

1655
01:55:16,163 --> 01:55:20,232
MARISHA: All right, so we're going to hike to the
outskirts of Westruun.

1656
01:55:20,232 --> 01:55:25,697
MATT: Okay. You guys, during this journey, find
your way northward. Are you skirting around the

1657
01:55:25,697 --> 01:55:28,070
west side like you did when you first arrived?

1658
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:29,625
LAURA: Sure?

1659
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:31,945
MATT: All right.

1660
01:55:31,945 --> 01:55:38,586
LAURA: We're keeping a good distance, as we get
closer, so it lasts, I cast Pass Without a Trace

1661
01:55:38,586 --> 01:55:39,579
on us.

1662
01:55:39,579 --> 01:55:41,402
TRAVIS: We have that really nice high grass,
right?

1663
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:43,012
MATT: It was like waist-high or so.

1664
01:55:43,012 --> 01:55:44,971
TRAVIS: Not like cornstalk high.

1665
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:48,945
MATT: There were areas where there was, like
during the thick farmland, there are areas where

1666
01:55:48,945 --> 01:55:50,561
they have high-stalk.

1667
01:55:50,561 --> 01:55:54,540
TRAVIS: I'd like to stay there, I'd like to stay
in those areas.

1668
01:55:54,540 --> 01:56:00,687
MATT: Okay, so you'll be pretty much dodging from
farmland to farmland, on the outside. I need you

1669
01:56:00,687 --> 01:56:02,197
all to roll stealth checks, if you could?

1670
01:56:02,197 --> 01:56:04,205
LAURA: Add ten because I cast Pass Without a
Trace.

1671
01:56:04,205 --> 01:56:06,639
ASHLEY: I'm going to use, oh no. Because that
won't be enough time.

1672
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:09,160
SAM: Come on, Pikey.

1673
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:13,528
TRAVIS: That's good.

1674
01:56:13,528 --> 01:56:15,554
LAURA: That's really good. Plus ten.

1675
01:56:15,554 --> 01:56:16,838
ASHLEY: Plus ten?

1676
01:56:16,838 --> 01:56:18,700
LAURA: Yeah, because I cast Pass Without a Trace
on us.

1677
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,200
TRAVIS: 19. Oh. 29.

1678
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,450
ASHLEY: 24.

1679
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:22,900
LAURA: 33.

1680
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,894
LIAM: 30.

1681
01:56:23,894 --> 01:56:24,973
MARISHA: 32.

1682
01:56:24,973 --> 01:56:25,872
TALIESIN: 23.

1683
01:56:25,872 --> 01:56:26,954
SAM: 20.

1684
01:56:26,954 --> 01:56:28,254
MATT: All right.

1685
01:56:28,254 --> 01:56:29,437
ASHLEY: We're quiet.

1686
01:56:29,437 --> 01:56:31,021
TRAVIS: He rolled anyway.

1687
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:40,026
MATT: All right, as you guys leap into the high
grass, moving around the outside of Westruun, eyes

1688
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:48,191
peeled, as the sun sets and the night kicks in,
you try your best to watch for any patrols that

1689
01:56:48,191 --> 01:56:55,911
are keeping an eye. Make a perception check.

1690
01:56:55,911 --> 01:56:57,498
TRAVIS: 13.

1691
01:56:57,498 --> 01:56:58,475
SAM: 16.

1692
01:56:58,475 --> 01:56:59,436
MARISHA: 19.

1693
01:56:59,436 --> 01:57:00,323
TALIESIN: 20.

1694
01:57:00,323 --> 01:57:01,294
LIAM: 22.

1695
01:57:01,294 --> 01:57:02,277
LAURA: 32.

1696
01:57:02,277 --> 01:57:03,430
ASHLEY: 23.

1697
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:08,629
MATT: All right. The three of you guys glance over
and you do see there is a patrol of three

1698
01:57:08,629 --> 01:57:16,908
individuals, one of which appears to be goliath in
nature, the other two humanoid of some degree. In

1699
01:57:16,908 --> 01:57:21,050
the distance, it's hard to see this far away. And
they're patrolling the same area where you guys

1700
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:27,231
came through before. It appears like the patrol
has increased, like there's a mildly heightened

1701
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:32,446
state of awareness that something bad went down
recently. However, you stay far enough away and

1702
01:57:32,446 --> 01:57:37,893
out of sight, they do not catch visual on you and
eventually you get enough distance northward where

1703
01:57:37,893 --> 01:57:40,502
you feel like they haven't really noticed.

1704
01:57:40,502 --> 01:57:43,989
TRAVIS: Did we pass the area that we were at
before, where the farmer, Frederick?

1705
01:57:43,989 --> 01:57:46,119
MATT: Yeah, you passed that area, yeah.

1706
01:57:46,119 --> 01:57:47,424
TRAVIS: Did we see him?

1707
01:57:47,424 --> 01:57:48,953
MATT: You did not see him, no.

1708
01:57:48,953 --> 01:57:51,129
LAURA: Was his name Frederick? No, it was with an
'r'.

1709
01:57:51,129 --> 01:57:52,519
SAM: Can we go to that place?

1710
01:57:52,519 --> 01:57:54,502
TRAVIS: Reggie. Reginald, sorry.

1711
01:57:54,502 --> 01:58:01,204
SAM: Can we sneak there, can Vax sneak there? What
was the man's name who we killed?

1712
01:58:01,204 --> 01:58:03,186
LAURA: Oh, that you killed?

1713
01:58:03,186 --> 01:58:04,402
TRAVIS: Horace.

1714
01:58:04,402 --> 01:58:07,630
SAM: No no no, the goliath.

1715
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:08,910
TRAVIS: Horace.

1716
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:11,684
SAM: Vax, can you go get Horace's head?

1717
01:58:11,684 --> 01:58:13,732
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a good idea.

1718
01:58:13,732 --> 01:58:15,079
LIAM: Yeah, I can get that.

1719
01:58:15,079 --> 01:58:17,669
TALIESIN: I take that back, that's a great idea.

1720
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:20,921
LIAM: I don't know why, but I can get that.

1721
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:22,984
MATT: So you're heading forward to do that?

1722
01:58:22,984 --> 01:58:25,139
LAURA: I rolled a better stealth than him, though.

1723
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:28,647
MATT: Make a new stealth check. As you guys hold
back and you--

1724
01:58:28,647 --> 01:58:32,843
LAURA: Oh, that's so much better! No, it's good.

1725
01:58:32,843 --> 01:58:36,030
LIAM: 39.

1726
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:42,171
MATT: 39, okay. So as you guys wait in the back,
staying low to the grass, you watch as Vax dives

1727
01:58:42,171 --> 01:58:51,088
into the field and vanishes. You, darting in a
forward way, find your way to the outside of the

1728
01:58:51,088 --> 01:58:57,023
initial crop-grid. There does not appear to be any
guards that are watching this property. You recall

1729
01:58:57,023 --> 01:59:00,893
the various avenues you guys utilized in
systematically making your way from path to path.

1730
01:59:00,893 --> 01:59:04,125
It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to find
an area that looks familiar enough where you find

1731
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:10,542
your way into the center of one of the crop lanes
where the corpse of Horace recently was. Roll a

1732
01:59:10,542 --> 01:59:13,920
perception check.

1733
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,759
LIAM: 27.

1734
01:59:15,759 --> 01:59:20,078
MATT: 27. You get there and you glance about. But
the body's gone.

1735
01:59:20,078 --> 01:59:21,605
LIAM: Fuck.

1736
01:59:21,605 --> 01:59:26,480
MATT: Body's not there, it's taken. You start
following the trail, you see where maybe it was

1737
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,759
dragged off. Make a survival roll.

1738
01:59:28,759 --> 01:59:36,502
LIAM: Survival roll? Well, I'm going to use Luck,
because I slept. Yeah. 18.

1739
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:42,302
MATT: 18, okay, so you find signs of his body
being dragged and you start trying to find the

1740
01:59:42,302 --> 01:59:47,752
direction it was taken. You dart along, once again
keeping within the crops as best you can to stay

1741
01:59:47,752 --> 01:59:51,894
out of sight. You make your way out of the
northern side of it before the trail disappears.

1742
01:59:51,894 --> 01:59:57,127
You do not know where the body was taken, other
than north and outward. You glance over and all

1743
01:59:57,127 --> 02:00:00,646
you see is the original farmhouse where Reginald
was living, there's the crops out there, there's

1744
02:00:00,646 --> 02:00:09,202
the big scarecrow that was in the center. There
wasn't a scarecrow before. You look over real

1745
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:18,644
close and you see, strung up across a haphazard
wooden spike, arms out, is the currently being

1746
02:00:18,644 --> 02:00:25,739
pecked apart body of Reginald, who apparently
suffered the brunt of the discovery of Horace's

1747
02:00:25,739 --> 02:00:30,529
corpse in the time that has transpired since you
last left Westruun.

1748
02:00:30,529 --> 02:00:32,549
LIAM: Do I sense anything around?

1749
02:00:32,549 --> 02:00:37,493
MATT: At the moment? No. The patrol's probably
a good ten minutes before it's seeming,

1750
02:00:37,493 --> 02:00:41,852
because it's headed in the direction where you are
but you don't know, probably take ten or 15

1751
02:00:41,852 --> 02:00:44,329
minutes before they reach where you are.

1752
02:00:44,329 --> 02:00:47,944
LIAM: I'm going to stealth up to the body. Cut him
down.

1753
02:00:47,944 --> 02:00:50,679
MATT: Okay. Cut the ropes off, he slumps down.

1754
02:00:50,679 --> 02:00:52,689
LIAM: I shoulder him back to the group.

1755
02:00:52,689 --> 02:00:58,721
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check with
disadvantage.

1756
02:00:58,721 --> 02:01:01,287
LIAM: 20.

1757
02:01:01,287 --> 02:01:02,482
LAURA: 30.

1758
02:01:02,482 --> 02:01:03,822
LIAM: 25. 35.

1759
02:01:03,822 --> 02:01:10,480
MATT: Okay. Though he wasn't a very heavy
individual, and especially now that he's been out

1760
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:19,099
to dry for at least a couple days, most of the
bloat has worn off and the-- not going into

1761
02:01:19,099 --> 02:01:25,814
graphic detail, elements of the corpse have been
left behind. You bring most of him with you

1762
02:01:25,814 --> 02:01:32,860
through the grass over to the rest of the group.
You guys watch as Vax pulls his way up out of the

1763
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:36,341
grass, carrying over his shoulder the lifeless
body of Reginald.

1764
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:42,186
LIAM: Let's all talk about repercussions. And I
lay him out.

1765
02:01:42,186 --> 02:01:44,883
TALIESIN: Well, they know we're here now.

1766
02:01:44,883 --> 02:01:46,271
TRAVIS: Do they?

1767
02:01:46,271 --> 02:01:47,386
TALIESIN: Yes.

1768
02:01:47,386 --> 02:01:49,260
TRAVIS: I think they thought it was him.

1769
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:52,725
LIAM: They did not think the farmer killed
Horace.

1770
02:01:52,725 --> 02:01:55,804
TRAVIS: We should've sent him off to the camp.

1771
02:01:55,804 --> 02:02:01,387
TALIESIN: They know we're here now because now his
body's missing.

1772
02:02:01,387 --> 02:02:06,751
SAM: Also, I assume they tortured him before they
killed him.

1773
02:02:06,751 --> 02:02:08,940
TALIESIN: I don't know if they're that clever.

1774
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:14,107
SAM: Can you talk to the dead?

1775
02:02:14,107 --> 02:02:21,682
LIAM: These people were in a shit situation, while
I don't blame us entirely for this because of

1776
02:02:21,682 --> 02:02:28,723
where they live now, we must not do anything we're
doing lightly. There are many lives at stake, not

1777
02:02:28,723 --> 02:02:34,750
just Reginald's. Let's just not flit about, here,
let's take this seriously, please.

1778
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:37,546
TALIESIN: Should've left him up there.

1779
02:02:37,546 --> 02:02:39,250
MARISHA: What?

1780
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:45,075
TALIESIN: Should've cut him down tomorrow. One
more day up there would have made no difference to

1781
02:02:45,075 --> 02:02:48,565
him, and it's going to make a difference to us
because we have to move tonight now.

1782
02:02:48,565 --> 02:02:51,049
MARISHA: Maybe it's a matter of respect, Percy.

1783
02:02:51,049 --> 02:02:54,083
TALIESIN: Respect him by freeing his daughter.

1784
02:02:54,083 --> 02:02:55,593
TRAVIS: I agree.

1785
02:02:55,593 --> 02:02:59,501
LAURA and TALIESIN: They know we're here.

1786
02:02:59,501 --> 02:03:01,325
LAURA: They're going to see he's missing.

1787
02:03:01,325 --> 02:03:03,049
MARISHA: I think they already knew we were here.

1788
02:03:03,049 --> 02:03:04,292
TALIESIN: I don't think they did.

1789
02:03:04,292 --> 02:03:06,116
TRAVIS: I don't think they did either.

1790
02:03:06,116 --> 02:03:10,502
LIAM: Scanlan, can you make a fake stupid body,
can you make a scarecrow?

1791
02:03:10,502 --> 02:03:12,998
SAM: Not really. Not really.

1792
02:03:12,998 --> 02:03:14,319
LIAM: Can any of us?

1793
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:15,996
LAURA: I can fashion something.

1794
02:03:15,996 --> 02:03:20,423
TALIESIN: No, tonight's fine. There's nothing
wrong with tonight. I just figure, if we do it,

1795
02:03:20,423 --> 02:03:24,852
and we should do it, and obviously this is nothing
if not a sign that we should've done it sooner.

1796
02:03:24,852 --> 02:03:28,243
SAM: Why don't we just burn the whole field? They
won't know if there's a body in there or not.

1797
02:03:28,243 --> 02:03:32,428
TALIESIN: That was our reasoning last time, no, we
do this, I think we do this tonight.

1798
02:03:32,428 --> 02:03:34,928
MARISHA: We do this tonight?

1799
02:03:34,928 --> 02:03:44,538
ASHLEY: I could cast Speak with Dead and we could
ask him some questions.

1800
02:03:44,538 --> 02:03:46,493
SAM: We could.

1801
02:03:46,493 --> 02:03:48,574
ASHLEY: We could ask him up to five questions.

1802
02:03:48,574 --> 02:03:49,965
SAM: Let's do it.

1803
02:03:49,965 --> 02:03:51,766
TALIESIN: All right.

1804
02:03:51,766 --> 02:03:56,638
MATT: So you guys quietly press down in a small
area of grass to give you enough of a space for

1805
02:03:56,638 --> 02:04:02,918
you to go ahead and perform this ritual. As you
lay the body down, you look up to the sky and

1806
02:04:02,918 --> 02:04:08,411
where some of the cloud cover that is slowly
drawing over the area, there's a little gap in the

1807
02:04:08,411 --> 02:04:14,447
clouds, and as you look up to the now-visible
stars, you whisper Sarenrae's name, look down at

1808
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:20,431
the body, touch it with your hand, and the still
corpse, the chest begins to rise and fall with an

1809
02:04:20,431 --> 02:04:27,594
unnatural breath for the time being. The eyes
begin to twitch and move around. No physical

1810
02:04:27,594 --> 02:04:33,051
movement beyond that, but the mouth slowly draws
open and you hear, while the lips do not move, you

1811
02:04:33,051 --> 02:04:40,040
hear a voice emanate through like an exhale. "You
returned."

1812
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:43,832
LAURA: Reginald. We're so sorry.

1813
02:04:43,832 --> 02:04:52,930
MATT: "I knew what I was getting into. Do not fret
or blame."

1814
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:55,956
LAURA: We will rescue your daughter.

1815
02:04:55,956 --> 02:04:59,112
TRAVIS: Five questions. Vax. Make it count.

1816
02:04:59,112 --> 02:05:02,805
TALIESIN: Do they know we're coming?

1817
02:05:02,805 --> 02:05:04,647
LIAM: Me?

1818
02:05:04,647 --> 02:05:05,996
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1819
02:05:05,996 --> 02:05:08,010
SAM: I think we can all ask.

1820
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:16,853
LIAM: Reginald, how much do your murderers know?
About us?

1821
02:05:16,853 --> 02:05:25,903
MATT: "I told them it was me. They should not and
could not know your intent to return."

1822
02:05:25,903 --> 02:05:31,424
SAM: Can he describe the one who did it?

1823
02:05:31,424 --> 02:05:37,197
LIAM: Go ahead, Scanlan.

1824
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:52,513
SAM: Hi. Sorry. The ones who did you in. Other
than large and pale, were there any distinguishing

1825
02:05:52,513 --> 02:05:55,271
marks or names thrown about?

1826
02:05:55,271 --> 02:06:09,414
MATT: "They brought me to one of their leaders.
Half-tattooed face and brow and rags. His jaw,

1827
02:06:09,414 --> 02:06:18,517
"once broken, pushes to one side. I know not the
name."

1828
02:06:18,517 --> 02:06:24,070
TRAVIS: Do I understand that description?

1829
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:30,018
MATT: You recall the tattoo, and you recall the
moment the jaw was broken.

1830
02:06:30,018 --> 02:06:31,648
TRAVIS: I was wondering.

1831
02:06:31,648 --> 02:06:33,092
MATT: This was Zanror.

1832
02:06:33,092 --> 02:06:36,597
SAM: This was who?

1833
02:06:36,597 --> 02:06:37,790
TRAVIS: Kevdak's son.

1834
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:39,445
LIAM: He broke it. Grog broke it.

1835
02:06:39,445 --> 02:06:40,765
LAURA: Oh shit.

1836
02:06:40,765 --> 02:06:47,540
TALIESIN: What are the things that we face inside
the city? What should we fear inside the city?

1837
02:06:47,540 --> 02:07:00,451
MATT: "Fear those that are fueled by rage, skilled
with weapons, and those that call the elements

1838
02:07:00,451 --> 02:07:08,207
"their own. And the dragon does come."

1839
02:07:08,207 --> 02:07:16,726
TRAVIS: Does come. One more question, can we ask
if he's seen the dragon or how long it's been?

1840
02:07:16,726 --> 02:07:18,373
SAM: Go ahead.

1841
02:07:18,373 --> 02:07:27,001
TRAVIS: We thank you for your time. If we may, how
long has it been since the dragon was last here?

1842
02:07:27,001 --> 02:07:29,288
MATT: "Two days."

1843
02:07:29,288 --> 02:07:30,939
LAURA: It's coming tomorrow.

1844
02:07:30,939 --> 02:07:33,137
TRAVIS: Two days, it's coming back. Okay.

1845
02:07:33,137 --> 02:07:35,171
LAURA: That means tomorrow it's coming back.

1846
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:38,670
SAM: We can wait another day. How many more
questions?

1847
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:40,789
LAURA: Is that it, or one more?

1848
02:07:40,789 --> 02:07:42,050
SAM: No, we get five.

1849
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:43,430
TALIESIN: We have one more if we want it.

1850
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:46,977
SAM: What would you like us to tell your
daughter?

1851
02:07:46,977 --> 02:07:59,906
MATT: "Tell her that my life was given so she
could live hers. And my memory lives in her eyes."

1852
02:07:59,906 --> 02:08:05,290
And with that, the head just lolls back a little
bit, the jaw hangs open, the last of the breath in

1853
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:09,451
the chest (exhales) and the magic fades.

1854
02:08:09,451 --> 02:08:13,283
TALIESIN: Vax. We have to put it back.

1855
02:08:13,283 --> 02:08:14,943
LIAM: Yes.

1856
02:08:14,943 --> 02:08:19,376
MARISHA: They don't know we're here. It could be
anyone who could've cut him down. Why would they

1857
02:08:19,376 --> 02:08:22,898
suspect us? I would suspect the village people
first.

1858
02:08:22,898 --> 02:08:25,513
TRAVIS: I would too, and I'm the smartest of them
all.

1859
02:08:25,513 --> 02:08:31,430
LAURA: Which is actually worse. We need to put
something back up. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

1860
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:35,649
TALIESIN: He's going to save his daughter one last
time, we're going to put him back up for one day.

1861
02:08:35,649 --> 02:08:39,832
We're going to wait for the dragon to pass, and
then he will be buried on his land properly with

1862
02:08:39,832 --> 02:08:41,337
stone and dirt.

1863
02:08:41,337 --> 02:08:43,016
LIAM: Yes. I'll take him. Yes.

1864
02:08:43,016 --> 02:08:50,124
TALIESIN: Thank you. And thank you for bringing
him. This was helpful.

1865
02:08:50,124 --> 02:08:53,167
ASHLEY: Can we give him a proper burial?

1866
02:08:53,167 --> 02:08:54,750
TRAVIS: No, we're going to put him back up.

1867
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,852
ASHLEY: We're going to put him back up, that's
what you. Sorry.

1868
02:08:56,852 --> 02:09:00,076
MATT: Vax, are you taking the corpse back? Stealth
check with disadvantage.

1869
02:09:00,076 --> 02:09:01,930
LIAM: Disadvantage.

1870
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:03,691
MATT: Yeah, carrying him along, man.

1871
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:06,571
LIAM: Oh, it's all right, though, 35.

1872
02:09:06,571 --> 02:09:09,415
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.

1873
02:09:09,415 --> 02:09:18,832
MATT: Rogues. Coming back, as you approach the
outside you can see now the patrol has skirted by

1874
02:09:18,832 --> 02:09:24,275
and you have to wait patiently, but not wait too
long because you know you have about a 30-second

1875
02:09:24,275 --> 02:09:30,835
window before they will come into sight of this
farmstead. Using that, you dart forward, take the

1876
02:09:30,835 --> 02:09:34,709
body, thrust it up, trying to catch-- I want you
to go ahead and make a dexterity check to see how

1877
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:37,713
fast you can utilize what rope is at your
disposal.

1878
02:09:37,713 --> 02:09:39,888
LIAM: Just straight dexterity? 17.

1879
02:09:39,888 --> 02:09:44,366
MATT: 17. With that, you throw the body up, look
over your shoulder, grab out, pull out bits of

1880
02:09:44,366 --> 02:09:48,548
twine you have, a piece of rope or a piece of your
shirt that you (tearing noise) tear off to the side,

1881
02:09:48,548 --> 02:09:53,428
and fashion a quick knot over one arm and the
other, you look over your shoulder again, you can

1882
02:09:53,428 --> 02:09:57,297
see the shadow of them beginning to just turn
around the side, you get the other arm up, just

1883
02:09:57,297 --> 02:10:01,699
manage to slump it over the wood. You know there
isn't any more time, and with that you duck back

1884
02:10:01,699 --> 02:10:08,910
underneath the grass and vanish. He's haphazardly
up and one arm is not actually tied, it's just

1885
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:14,601
kind of laid over it, but he's currently back on
the wooden stake, across.

1886
02:10:14,601 --> 02:10:16,814
LIAM: Better than what it was.

1887
02:10:16,814 --> 02:10:23,061
MATT: As you dart back and slowly return to your
group, glancing over in that direction, the patrol

1888
02:10:23,061 --> 02:10:26,017
doesn't seem to take notice and continues walking
past.

1889
02:10:26,017 --> 02:10:35,954
TRAVIS: So am I the only one that, while we wait,
is itching for a fight?

1890
02:10:35,954 --> 02:10:37,745
LAURA: Grog.

1891
02:10:37,745 --> 02:10:39,625
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, look, it's just who I am.

1892
02:10:39,625 --> 02:10:45,426
SAM: Well listen, if you want a fight, we could
still use one of their heads. We could find one of

1893
02:10:45,426 --> 02:10:51,153
those patrolmen walking around, grab him, take his
head.

1894
02:10:51,153 --> 02:10:54,013
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Too soon.

1895
02:10:54,013 --> 02:10:56,012
MARISHA: Did we not just learn anything?

1896
02:10:56,012 --> 02:11:00,726
LIAM: We're going to be fighting soon enough. I
think everyone should hide inside your love shack

1897
02:11:00,726 --> 02:11:06,460
and my sister and I should wait here in the grass
and watch and wait. And when the dragon comes, we

1898
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,134
alert you all.

1899
02:11:08,134 --> 02:11:13,419
TALIESIN: We wait for a dragon pass. The day after
the dragon passes, we strike.

1900
02:11:13,419 --> 02:11:14,605
LAURA: I agree.

1901
02:11:14,605 --> 02:11:15,620
TRAVIS: Okay.

1902
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:16,778
MARISHA: Let's go.

1903
02:11:16,778 --> 02:11:24,596
MATT: You guys, most of you, other than the twins,
head into the magnificent mansion. An evening that

1904
02:11:24,596 --> 02:11:31,320
is restful by definition but still wracked with
tension and anxiety. You guys watch throughout the

1905
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:37,950
night, relatively uneventful, though a cool
evening. Without building a fire, you both do have

1906
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:43,974
to keep bundled up against the elements. It's not
cold enough to the point where it's going to be

1907
02:11:43,974 --> 02:11:45,658
impactful, but it is chilly.

1908
02:11:45,658 --> 02:11:47,384
LIAM: I fart a lot.

1909
02:11:47,384 --> 02:11:49,687
MATT: The farting does keep you warm, Vax.

1910
02:11:49,687 --> 02:11:52,429
TALIESIN: I want to tinker for the evening as
well.

1911
02:11:52,429 --> 02:11:54,650
MATT: Make another tinker check.

1912
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:58,320
TALIESIN: 21.

1913
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:05,023
MATT: 21. Okay. You made headway. You've
constructed a portion of the seat and the

1914
02:12:05,023 --> 02:12:09,247
apparatus that connects it to the broom without
interfering with the enchantment. Right now it's

1915
02:12:09,247 --> 02:12:15,515
testing that and then getting the stirrups and
making sure that it's functional and not going to

1916
02:12:15,515 --> 02:12:16,644
get her killed.

1917
02:12:16,644 --> 02:12:18,650
TALIESIN: Whatever night we have time, I want to
keep poking at that.

1918
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:24,793
MARISHA: Can I also spend some time practicing a
Protection from Energy potion?

1919
02:12:24,793 --> 02:12:30,488
MATT: Want to go ahead and utilize the
delightfully presented brewing vicinity in the--

1920
02:12:30,488 --> 02:12:31,744
MARISHA: I do.

1921
02:12:31,744 --> 02:12:32,881
MATT: All right, sure.

1922
02:12:32,881 --> 02:12:35,414
MARISHA: Not enough to where I can't, you know,
sleep, but just, you know.

1923
02:12:35,414 --> 02:12:39,470
TALIESIN: I'm going to lend her my resist
lightning ring so that she can study it and

1924
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:42,506
hopefully come up with a resist energy potion.

1925
02:12:42,506 --> 02:12:46,655
MATT: Okay. I'll say, what level is that?

1926
02:12:46,655 --> 02:12:49,556
MARISHA: Protection from Energy is a 3rd-level
spell.

1927
02:12:49,556 --> 02:12:52,631
(musical tone)

1928
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:54,415
MATT: I don't know what that was.

1929
02:12:54,415 --> 02:12:57,572
TALIESIN: Matt Mercer, white courtesy phone. Matt
Mercer, white courtesy phone.

1930
02:12:57,572 --> 02:13:00,182
MATT: Now reaching housewares, spell scrolls.

1931
02:13:00,182 --> 02:13:03,342
LIAM: Kevdak, you are wanted at the front gates.

1932
02:13:03,342 --> 02:13:07,114
MATT: Third, that would be an uncommon spell
scroll, that would put it, I'd say that'd put it

1933
02:13:07,114 --> 02:13:15,487
about-- how many gold pieces? I'd say you begin
the process of brewing one.

1934
02:13:15,487 --> 02:13:16,744
MARISHA: All right.

1935
02:13:16,744 --> 02:13:18,636
MATT: It'll take you a little while to get that
done.

1936
02:13:18,636 --> 02:13:19,640
MARISHA: Okay.

1937
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:22,546
MATT: A few days, at the very least. All right,
so.

1938
02:13:22,546 --> 02:13:28,497
SAM: Grog. Just before tomorrow and stuff,
Kevdak.

1939
02:13:28,497 --> 02:13:29,492
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1940
02:13:29,492 --> 02:13:30,793
SAM: His son is--

1941
02:13:30,793 --> 02:13:32,272
TRAVIS: Zanror.

1942
02:13:32,272 --> 02:13:34,366
SAM: Zanror.

1943
02:13:34,366 --> 02:13:45,092
TRAVIS: It's spelled-- it's spelled like this. And
then like it sounds.

1944
02:13:45,092 --> 02:13:51,082
SAM: Sure, sure. Standard spelling. What about
anyone else I need to know about? Who you were

1945
02:13:51,082 --> 02:13:53,529
familiar with or had a relationship with?

1946
02:13:53,529 --> 02:13:56,886
TRAVIS: Nah. Not any longer.

1947
02:13:56,886 --> 02:14:01,785
SAM: All right, so, we're still resting, right?

1948
02:14:01,785 --> 02:14:02,777
MATT: Yes.

1949
02:14:02,777 --> 02:14:07,797
SAM: So I'm going to knock on Pike's door.
(knocking sound)

1950
02:14:07,797 --> 02:14:10,679
ASHLEY: I don't answer. No, I'm just kidding.

1951
02:14:10,679 --> 02:14:12,999
SAM: (whispers) I can still get in.

1952
02:14:12,999 --> 02:14:16,420
ASHLEY: Hi, Scanlan.

1953
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:20,371
SAM: Hello. Did you get your robe and everything
and your slippers?

1954
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:21,941
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, slippers and everything.

1955
02:14:21,941 --> 02:14:23,381
SAM: The monogram?

1956
02:14:23,381 --> 02:14:26,311
ASHLEY: Yes, it's great, thank you so much. P.T.

1957
02:14:26,311 --> 02:14:28,264
SAM: And the scented candles?

1958
02:14:28,264 --> 02:14:31,193
ASHLEY: Yes, it smells so good in here. Thank
you.

1959
02:14:31,193 --> 02:14:36,422
SAM: Great, great. If you need anything, there's
two bells next to your bed, there's one to call

1960
02:14:36,422 --> 02:14:38,354
servants and there's one for me.

1961
02:14:38,354 --> 02:14:39,578
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you, Scanlan.

1962
02:14:39,578 --> 02:14:40,838
SAM: The purple one is mine.

1963
02:14:40,838 --> 02:14:42,126
MARISHA: Percy and I strategize.

1964
02:14:42,126 --> 02:14:43,522
TALIESIN: We're doing strategies.

1965
02:14:43,522 --> 02:14:52,814
SAM: Great. Listen, there's been a lot of death
recently and, well, just, I might die and stuff

1966
02:14:52,814 --> 02:14:56,718
so, ah. Just don't read this until I do.

1967
02:14:56,718 --> 02:14:59,401
LIAM: Can I read it?

1968
02:14:59,401 --> 02:15:00,622
LAURA: Don't!

1969
02:15:00,622 --> 02:15:02,243
ASHLEY: What is this?

1970
02:15:02,243 --> 02:15:03,641
LAURA: Pass it over.

1971
02:15:03,641 --> 02:15:08,986
LIAM: Do you want to go steady? If yes, check this
box.

1972
02:15:08,986 --> 02:15:14,263
ASHLEY: "Do not open" and in parentheses "(until
I'm dead)."

1973
02:15:14,263 --> 02:15:16,188
SAM: That's all.

1974
02:15:16,188 --> 02:15:18,507
ASHLEY: Well, hopefully I never have to open
this.

1975
02:15:18,507 --> 02:15:22,698
SAM: I hope so, too. That's all. Have a good
night.

1976
02:15:22,698 --> 02:15:26,077
ASHLEY: Bye, Scanlan.

1977
02:15:26,077 --> 02:15:27,191
SAM: Bye.

1978
02:15:27,191 --> 02:15:28,918
LIAM: (whispers) Secrets.

1979
02:15:28,918 --> 02:15:30,603
ASHLEY: I close the door, I open it, and I read
it.

1980
02:15:30,603 --> 02:15:34,877
(cheering)

1981
02:15:34,877 --> 02:15:38,223
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of
you!

1982
02:15:38,223 --> 02:15:44,067
TRAVIS: Nobody look, nobody look. Don't you look!
Don't you look. Don't you look.

1983
02:15:44,067 --> 02:15:51,633
LAURA: She's full-on reading it!

1984
02:15:51,633 --> 02:15:53,521
SAM: You know what? I love her anyway.

1985
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:57,743
(laughter)

1986
02:15:57,743 --> 02:16:05,064
ASHLEY: This is a bit of tome, so I think I should
wait to read this, but a part of me-- Oh.

1987
02:16:05,064 --> 02:16:07,206
MATT: Okay.

1988
02:16:07,206 --> 02:16:09,035
TALIESIN: You clever fucker. Good god.

1989
02:16:09,035 --> 02:16:15,303
ASHLEY: Oh, man. (gasps)

1990
02:16:15,303 --> 02:16:19,657
LAURA: Oh, I want to know what it says so fucking
bad!

1991
02:16:19,657 --> 02:16:22,491
TRAVIS: We got to wait for her to finish, because
the night is young.

1992
02:16:22,491 --> 02:16:24,074
SAM: It's all dick pics.

1993
02:16:24,074 --> 02:16:26,131
(laughter)

1994
02:16:26,131 --> 02:16:28,757
LAURA: The cube. Over and over and over again.

1995
02:16:28,757 --> 02:16:31,528
MATT: In the meantime, while you're reading that,
you guys are doing what?

1996
02:16:31,528 --> 02:16:34,231
TALIESIN: We were strategizing. We were just,
we're figuring out some strategy for how to make

1997
02:16:34,231 --> 02:16:35,545
this work.

1998
02:16:35,545 --> 02:16:36,774
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

1999
02:16:36,774 --> 02:16:38,605
LIAM: Dick pics hand-drawn by quill.

2000
02:16:38,605 --> 02:16:40,495
TALIESIN: By candlelight.

2001
02:16:40,495 --> 02:16:48,361
MATT: As the evening progresses, you guys rest,
preparing yourselves for the next day. You guys--

2002
02:16:48,361 --> 02:16:49,397
LAURA: We're still outside.

2003
02:16:49,397 --> 02:16:55,486
MATT: You guys are woken up right as the sun
begins to rise by the distant sound of

2004
02:16:55,486 --> 02:17:02,187
(roar, sweeping wings).

2005
02:17:02,187 --> 02:17:03,501
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

2006
02:17:03,501 --> 02:17:06,499
MATT: You shake Vax awake and you guys look up
from the grass and you can see, coming down from

2007
02:17:06,499 --> 02:17:16,522
the very very top of Gatshadow, you see the wings
unfurled and with each swoosh down, the gargantuan

2008
02:17:16,522 --> 02:17:24,955
black dragon streaks down, dive bombs just past
the Bramblewood, and scoots over the entire city

2009
02:17:24,955 --> 02:17:35,584
of Westruun, making its presence known. As it just
roars out (roar, sweeping wings), circling over

2010
02:17:35,584 --> 02:17:43,938
the city twice, three times, as you see lights
going on in the city. As it goes over three times,

2011
02:17:43,938 --> 02:17:53,484
seemingly content that it's made its presence
known and asserted its vocal dominance over the

2012
02:17:53,484 --> 02:18:03,419
vicinity by instilling some early-morning fear in
the denizens of this town, the dragon then lands a

2013
02:18:03,419 --> 02:18:09,816
little bit northwest of the city itself. It's hard
to make out exactly what's happening at this

2014
02:18:09,816 --> 02:18:18,980
distance, but you see it, at its size, circle
around an area, scrape into the dirt a bit, take a

2015
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:29,072
moment, makes a couple of grumbled (snarls). Takes
one of its claws and scoops up a large cart that

2016
02:18:29,072 --> 02:18:38,955
has apparently a few sacks inside of it. And its
wings (sweeping wings). It begins taking up in the

2017
02:18:38,955 --> 02:18:46,235
air again and you can see now there are three
goliaths that are walking away from the point. As

2018
02:18:46,235 --> 02:18:52,517
the dragon turns and scoops one up in its other
claw. And the two others turn around and watch it

2019
02:18:52,517 --> 02:18:56,061
as it takes off towards the top of the mountain,
unable to do anything.

2020
02:18:56,061 --> 02:19:01,106
LAURA: That's one less fuck we have to worry
about.

2021
02:19:01,106 --> 02:19:03,179
MATT: Up onto Gatshadow.

2022
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:08,350
TALIESIN: So we're watching the other two head
back towards the--

2023
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:12,037
MATT: Nobody sees this except for the twins.

2024
02:19:12,037 --> 02:19:14,053
TRAVIS: No windows? Okay.

2025
02:19:14,053 --> 02:19:16,041
MATT: No, you guys are in another
plane. You look out the window and it's just like

2026
02:19:16,041 --> 02:19:18,007
this purple expanse.

2027
02:19:18,007 --> 02:19:28,181
LIAM: It seems like a slim thread of hope, but
perhaps the underlings are not entirely satisfied

2028
02:19:28,181 --> 02:19:34,350
with this arrangement? Just scooped one up.

2029
02:19:34,350 --> 02:19:40,351
LAURA: It's possible. I have a feeling they're
having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to

2030
02:19:40,351 --> 02:19:43,068
offer after this many days.

2031
02:19:43,068 --> 02:19:44,695
LIAM: Yeah.

2032
02:19:44,695 --> 02:19:47,070
LAURA: Fuck.

2033
02:19:47,070 --> 02:19:51,897
LIAM: It's a long shot, but you told me about
those giants.

2034
02:19:51,897 --> 02:19:53,621
LAURA: Yes?

2035
02:19:53,621 --> 02:19:58,503
LIAM: When you were with Zahra, and they turned.
We shouldn't rely on it.

2036
02:19:58,503 --> 02:20:06,681
LAURA: It's possible. If Grog can take control of
the Herd, they may be able to fight with us. But I

2037
02:20:06,681 --> 02:20:08,793
wouldn't trust them.

2038
02:20:08,793 --> 02:20:11,632
LIAM: No.

2039
02:20:11,632 --> 02:20:13,100
LAURA: We need to tell the others.

2040
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:14,346
LIAM: Yep.

2041
02:20:14,346 --> 02:20:20,456
MATT: You guys find your way back to the door,
entering the mansion. Servants have already, at

2042
02:20:20,456 --> 02:20:28,094
the sound of you entering, begin to appear out of
their spectral, ethereal states, bowing to you,

2043
02:20:28,094 --> 02:20:29,815
offering to take your coat.

2044
02:20:29,815 --> 02:20:31,428
LIAM: Chicken, please.

2045
02:20:31,428 --> 02:20:38,295
MATT: "Right away, sir." And they drift off to
prepare your bountiful breakfast. Eventually you

2046
02:20:38,295 --> 02:20:43,228
go ahead and begin to muster the rest of your
party down towards the breakfast area, and the

2047
02:20:43,228 --> 02:20:49,766
rest of you come to consciousness and find your
way to where the food is being served and Vex and

2048
02:20:49,766 --> 02:20:54,206
Vax both wait, rather stone-faced, and prepared to
speak.

2049
02:20:54,206 --> 02:21:04,356
LAURA: Well. Dragon came. Not happy. You'll be
glad to know, however, that it took one of your

2050
02:21:04,356 --> 02:21:05,832
Herd away with it.

2051
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:09,027
TALIESIN: I imagine the offering was a little
light.

2052
02:21:09,027 --> 02:21:11,100
LAURA: Yes, that's what I think as well.

2053
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:16,399
TRAVIS: From the three that were walking around?

2054
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:18,271
LAURA: Yes.

2055
02:21:18,271 --> 02:21:19,955
TRAVIS: What did the other two do?

2056
02:21:19,955 --> 02:21:26,314
LAURA: Not much. What are you going to do when a
dragon comes and takes someone away? Stand there

2057
02:21:26,314 --> 02:21:27,760
and watch, really.

2058
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,748
LIAM: Your buddy Horace made it sound like it was
easy street, but I don't know if that's entirely

2059
02:21:30,748 --> 02:21:32,181
accurate.

2060
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:34,742
TRAVIS: We can use that.

2061
02:21:34,742 --> 02:21:40,334
LAURA: They may not be very happy with the dragon
right now. They may not care at all.

2062
02:21:40,334 --> 02:21:43,584
TALIESIN: They may not be very happy with
leadership that leaves them in a place where

2063
02:21:43,584 --> 02:21:50,883
they're being taken advantage of. That's very
clever. Might be time to move on.

2064
02:21:50,883 --> 02:21:53,703
SAM: Move on? Move in?

2065
02:21:53,703 --> 02:21:55,062
TALIESIN: For them to leave.

2066
02:21:55,062 --> 02:21:56,527
SAM: Oh, for them to move on.

2067
02:21:56,527 --> 02:21:58,320
TALIESIN: This is not a good deal for them
anymore.

2068
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:00,116
LAURA: So we start today, yes?

2069
02:22:00,116 --> 02:22:02,185
TALIESIN: I think it starts today.

2070
02:22:02,185 --> 02:22:03,811
MARISHA: I think it starts right now.

2071
02:22:03,811 --> 02:22:06,448
SAM: Want to go in?

2072
02:22:06,448 --> 02:22:09,267
TRAVIS: Well, I haven't had my morning shit yet,
but as soon as I do--

2073
02:22:09,267 --> 02:22:12,558
LAURA: While Grog shits, I'm just going to take a
little nap, while he's shitting, it takes a while

2074
02:22:12,558 --> 02:22:13,704
usually, right?

2075
02:22:13,704 --> 02:22:14,962
MARISHA: Sure, yeah, yeah.

2076
02:22:14,962 --> 02:22:16,200
LIAM: Same, same.

2077
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,388
TALIESIN: He'll play Candy Crush.

2078
02:22:17,388 --> 02:22:19,177
LAURA: Something to recover a little bit of time.

2079
02:22:19,177 --> 02:22:20,740
SAM: Want me to guard the door?

2080
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:22,411
TRAVIS: I don't think I need it this time.

2081
02:22:22,411 --> 02:22:24,131
(laughter)

2082
02:22:24,131 --> 02:22:29,016
LAURA: I'll be right back.

2083
02:22:29,016 --> 02:22:30,299
TRAVIS: What, you really got to go?

2084
02:22:30,299 --> 02:22:31,553
LAURA: Oh no. Blocked.

2085
02:22:31,553 --> 02:22:33,401
SAM: She's going to go take a shit.

2086
02:22:33,401 --> 02:22:34,699
LAURA: Don't say that!

2087
02:22:34,699 --> 02:22:36,187
LIAM: Laura doesn't shit!

2088
02:22:36,187 --> 02:22:39,623
SAM: No, she doesn't.

2089
02:22:39,623 --> 02:22:45,487
TRAVIS: All right. Yeah, then we do it. And we do
it the way we said. Right?

2090
02:22:45,487 --> 02:22:49,953
SAM: You want me to go in, draw out as many as I
can, but wait, no, first we have to prepare a

2091
02:22:49,953 --> 02:22:52,132
trap, don't we? Isn't there a trap to be
prepared?

2092
02:22:52,132 --> 02:22:59,609
MARISHA: Yes, I can dig a trench pretty quickly,
honestly, if we want to go the trench route? Is

2093
02:22:59,609 --> 02:23:00,753
that we were thinking?

2094
02:23:00,753 --> 02:23:02,224
TRAVIS: Now here's the thing. Sorry.

2095
02:23:02,224 --> 02:23:04,090
SAM: You need to be inside the city gates as
well.

2096
02:23:04,090 --> 02:23:05,814
TRAVIS: Well, hold on, what were you going to
say?

2097
02:23:05,814 --> 02:23:07,592
ASHLEY: No, I, go.

2098
02:23:07,592 --> 02:23:13,772
TRAVIS: So if we try and build that trench
outside, right, we risk being seen and then pop

2099
02:23:13,772 --> 02:23:17,478
goes the weasel. If you go in--

2100
02:23:17,478 --> 02:23:20,889
SAM: While I'm in, you can build the trench.

2101
02:23:20,889 --> 02:23:27,456
TRAVIS: Well, what, can you go in looking like me,
or can you go in looking like me on fire?

2102
02:23:27,456 --> 02:23:31,120
SAM: Go in and what?

2103
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:36,549
TRAVIS: Can you conjure just me, or could you be
me as a walking flame?

2104
02:23:36,549 --> 02:23:46,782
SAM: Hmm, that would be harder. Yeah, that would
be harder to do, to pull off, you're big. You're

2105
02:23:46,782 --> 02:23:47,933
pretty big.

2106
02:23:47,933 --> 02:23:51,255
TRAVIS: Oh I know, this is like a one-time thing
for me, so I figured I'd just do it rockstar. I

2107
02:23:51,255 --> 02:23:52,830
just want to see what it looks like.

2108
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:58,273
SAM: If someone else set me on literal fire, I
could, but I wouldn't--

2109
02:23:58,273 --> 02:24:01,822
TRAVIS: We'll stand down from that idea, it was
just a thought, no problem.

2110
02:24:01,822 --> 02:24:03,946
TALIESIN: There's no bad idea when we're
workshopping.

2111
02:24:03,946 --> 02:24:05,299
SAM: Spitballing, spitballing.

2112
02:24:05,299 --> 02:24:08,551
TRAVIS: If we want to do the trench, we have to
wait for nightfall.

2113
02:24:08,551 --> 02:24:16,186
SAM: I was going to make myself look like you, but
a dead version of you. A zombified Grog.

2114
02:24:16,186 --> 02:24:21,320
TRAVIS: I'm all right with that. Can I hear your
best undead Grog?

2115
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:30,131
SAM: (Grog voice) Right. So. Right so I'm. Ugh,
I'm so dead.

2116
02:24:30,131 --> 02:24:32,083
LIAM: Maybe you don't say anything.

2117
02:24:32,083 --> 02:24:33,501
(laughter)

2118
02:24:33,501 --> 02:24:40,141
SAM: No, no, I just have to warm up, ah, mimimimi,
right, right, rrrr. Cor, all right then, I've been

2119
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:43,288
dead for about five, six years.

2120
02:24:43,288 --> 02:24:49,798
TRAVIS: It's amazing, it's like a verbal mirror.
So, if we do the trench, though,

2121
02:24:49,798 --> 02:24:51,733
we have to-- Percy--

2122
02:24:51,733 --> 02:24:57,084
MARISHA: I could theoretically dig the trench
possibly without anybody noticing, like tunnel

2123
02:24:57,084 --> 02:25:04,944
underground and just tunnel it out and maybe even,
you know. Leave like a thin layer of dirt,

2124
02:25:04,944 --> 02:25:07,423
possibly? I dunno. Maybe.

2125
02:25:07,423 --> 02:25:08,609
LIAM: Like Dig Dug.

2126
02:25:08,609 --> 02:25:10,794
MARISHA: Like Dig Dug. Exactly the same thing.

2127
02:25:10,794 --> 02:25:15,864
SAM: Wait, can't you just shape earth without
affecting the surface of it, I mean, can't you

2128
02:25:15,864 --> 02:25:17,384
just shape the underneath of it?

2129
02:25:17,384 --> 02:25:18,329
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying.

2130
02:25:18,329 --> 02:25:19,742
SAM: No one will even see it being moved.

2131
02:25:19,742 --> 02:25:21,934
MARISHA: And I could possibly maybe carve it thin
enough to where when

2132
02:25:21,934 --> 02:25:23,717
they run over it it'll collapse.

2133
02:25:23,717 --> 02:25:25,326
TRAVIS: Percy, what was your idea?

2134
02:25:25,326 --> 02:25:28,161
TALIESIN: And mix a little black powder into the
dirt.

2135
02:25:28,161 --> 02:25:31,515
MARISHA: Well, I was also hoping, oh, and explode
it as they run by--

2136
02:25:31,515 --> 02:25:33,232
TALIESIN: Hit it with lightning and it'll go up.

2137
02:25:33,232 --> 02:25:39,278
MARISHA: Also, if we could maybe have something fancy
at the bottom of it to, you know. Finish them off.

2138
02:25:39,278 --> 02:25:41,014
TALIESIN: Do we have something fancy to put at the
bottom?

2139
02:25:41,014 --> 02:25:42,746
SAM: We have a bear.

2140
02:25:42,746 --> 02:25:48,727
TRAVIS: If we do the ditch for
the people that're coming out of the city, we

2141
02:25:48,727 --> 02:25:54,522
waste it if it's not Zanror and Kevdak. If we go
in--

2142
02:25:54,522 --> 02:25:57,169
LAURA: At least it gets them out of commission.

2143
02:25:57,169 --> 02:25:59,389
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought the trench was to thin
the herd.

2144
02:25:59,389 --> 02:26:00,411
LAURA: Yeah.

2145
02:26:00,411 --> 02:26:04,781
MARISHA: Literally.

2146
02:26:04,781 --> 02:26:07,980
LAURA: Good. I like it.

2147
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:11,083
SAM: So, wait, is there a gate to the city?

2148
02:26:11,083 --> 02:26:17,601
MATT: There are multiple entrances to the city.
The few that you've seen are guarded with

2149
02:26:17,601 --> 02:26:27,403
outward-facing defensive spikes and pikes that are
set up to prevent any sort of like cavalry entry

2150
02:26:27,403 --> 02:26:29,727
or just as a warning.

2151
02:26:29,727 --> 02:26:32,355
LIAM: I have a question.

2152
02:26:32,355 --> 02:26:33,574
MATT: Yes.

2153
02:26:33,574 --> 02:26:35,366
LIAM: For Grog.

2154
02:26:35,366 --> 02:26:37,435
(crash in the background)

2155
02:26:37,435 --> 02:26:40,437
SAM: (laughs) What the hell's going on there
tonight?

2156
02:26:40,437 --> 02:26:45,792
LIAM: We fought your father and he was dead.
What's the last thing the Herd

2157
02:26:45,792 --> 02:26:47,483
has heard of your father?

2158
02:26:47,483 --> 02:26:56,306
TRAVIS: I don't know. Last thing I remember, I was
looking up at my father. And the rest of my Herd.

2159
02:26:56,306 --> 02:26:59,067
He made no move to save me.

2160
02:26:59,067 --> 02:27:07,510
LIAM: Well. I don't know how he got there, but we
saved you from your father and the dead guy deep

2161
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:17,274
underground, so they lost him at some point. What
if instead of Grog, you appeared as Grog's dad?

2162
02:27:17,274 --> 02:27:19,808
SAM: I don't know what Grog's dad looks like.

2163
02:27:19,808 --> 02:27:23,761
LIAM: Yes you do, you fought him. He was a rotting
corpse in front of you trying to kill you.

2164
02:27:23,761 --> 02:27:25,536
TRAVIS: Way back in the beginning.

2165
02:27:25,536 --> 02:27:27,112
SAM: Of course. How could I forget?

2166
02:27:27,112 --> 02:27:29,048
(laughter)

2167
02:27:29,048 --> 02:27:32,226
LIAM: Make yourself look like that, I'm not
exactly sure what that would do.

2168
02:27:32,226 --> 02:27:35,237
TALIESIN and LIAM: It could be interesting.

2169
02:27:35,237 --> 02:27:40,301
MARISHA: I mean, it could also further instill
Grog being powerful and undead.

2170
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:42,862
TALIESIN: Yes, that's actually even better.

2171
02:27:42,862 --> 02:27:46,265
LAURA: If he brought his father back to fight
underneath him.

2172
02:27:46,265 --> 02:27:48,950
MARISHA: With him, right, like he's a
necromancer.

2173
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:55,001
LIAM: And Kevdak would think that Grog's father
was serving him.

2174
02:27:55,001 --> 02:27:56,125
MARISHA: Yes.

2175
02:27:56,125 --> 02:28:02,576
LIAM: And he wouldn't feel pissy if he saw one
Grog do a magic trick and then the other Grog

2176
02:28:02,576 --> 02:28:06,715
sprang up and said, "Fight me instead." It would
seem more real.

2177
02:28:06,715 --> 02:28:08,583
SAM: What was your dad's name?

2178
02:28:08,583 --> 02:28:11,725
LIAM: Larry?

2179
02:28:11,725 --> 02:28:13,577
TALIESIN: Curly.

2180
02:28:13,577 --> 02:28:14,834
MARISHA: Moe.

2181
02:28:14,834 --> 02:28:19,759
MATT: Do you remember? It was Stonejaw. So
Stonejaw Strongjaw.

2182
02:28:19,759 --> 02:28:22,726
(laughter)

2183
02:28:22,726 --> 02:28:23,903
LIAM: Wow.

2184
02:28:23,903 --> 02:28:25,327
SAM: That's a terrible name!

2185
02:28:25,327 --> 02:28:27,077
TALIESIN: That's embarrassing.

2186
02:28:27,077 --> 02:28:28,092
LAURA: Wow.

2187
02:28:28,092 --> 02:28:30,221
LIAM: That's like George Foreman IV.

2188
02:28:30,221 --> 02:28:31,959
LAURA: He had an intelligence of four.

2189
02:28:31,959 --> 02:28:33,114
MATT: I know, yeah.

2190
02:28:33,114 --> 02:28:34,651
TRAVIS: It's a repressed memory, all right?

2191
02:28:34,651 --> 02:28:36,770
TALIESIN: All right.

2192
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:38,117
TRAVIS: He comes up never.

2193
02:28:38,117 --> 02:28:39,337
LIAM: This is George Foreman.

2194
02:28:39,337 --> 02:28:42,925
LIAM and MARISHA: This is also George Foreman.
These three guys are also George Foreman.

2195
02:28:42,925 --> 02:28:44,516
MATT: Other brother Darryl.

2196
02:28:44,516 --> 02:28:53,103
TALIESIN: All right. So I say you, your dad, and
maybe Pike walk up to the front door and then we get

2197
02:28:53,103 --> 02:28:56,104
ready to hit them with the doozy once things
start.

2198
02:28:56,104 --> 02:28:59,844
MARISHA: All right, give me a little bit of time
to dig a ditch.

2199
02:28:59,844 --> 02:29:01,036
TALIESIN: No Pike?

2200
02:29:01,036 --> 02:29:03,791
TRAVIS: No. If I walk in, I want to walk in on my
own.

2201
02:29:03,791 --> 02:29:08,179
LAURA: So this is only your fake father walking up
at this point.

2202
02:29:08,179 --> 02:29:09,755
TRAVIS: As the distraction, right?

2203
02:29:09,755 --> 02:29:10,613
LAURA: Yes.

2204
02:29:10,613 --> 02:29:11,782
LAURA: Done.

2205
02:29:11,782 --> 02:29:15,479
TALIESIN: You're going to lure them out and we're
going to hit them when they come out.

2206
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:23,294
SAM: Okay, but wait. I've got to bring them out of
a specific gate where there's going to be a trap

2207
02:29:23,294 --> 02:29:29,050
and if you go in and rescue any other civilians,
you have to bring them out through a different

2208
02:29:29,050 --> 02:29:30,483
gate that doesn't have a trap at it.

2209
02:29:30,483 --> 02:29:32,077
MARISHA: We're not going to worry about that.

2210
02:29:32,077 --> 02:29:34,020
TALIESIN: We're not going to evacuate several
thousand people, it's just not going to happen.

2211
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:35,059
SAM: Okay.

2212
02:29:35,059 --> 02:29:37,060
LAURA: We're going to kill Kevdak. He's going to
kill Kevdak.

2213
02:29:37,060 --> 02:29:39,808
SAM: All right. I'm ready to do this except for a
few holes in our plan.

2214
02:29:39,808 --> 02:29:40,789
TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead.

2215
02:29:40,789 --> 02:29:42,408
SAM: I don't run very fast.

2216
02:29:42,408 --> 02:29:44,470
(laughter)

2217
02:29:44,470 --> 02:29:50,860
SAM: Maybe if I Polymorph as a goliath, I would
have their speed, right?

2218
02:29:50,860 --> 02:29:56,407
ASHLEY: What if you borrow my boots that levitate?
Then you can--

2219
02:29:56,407 --> 02:30:01,254
SAM: I can't move myself, though, I couldn't just,
I would be the Dread Pirate Roberts.

2220
02:30:01,254 --> 02:30:04,115
MATT: There will be no survivors.

2221
02:30:04,115 --> 02:30:05,507
ASHLEY: All right, all right, bad idea.

2222
02:30:05,507 --> 02:30:10,923
SAM: But if I am Polymorphed as a goliath, would I
gain their-- all their abilities and--

2223
02:30:10,923 --> 02:30:12,536
MATT: Their movement speed, yes.

2224
02:30:12,536 --> 02:30:13,510
SAM: Intelligence?

2225
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:16,386
MATT: Yeah. It's everything--

2226
02:30:16,386 --> 02:30:19,824
TALIESIN: So why not just look like them and if
you need to you can make a bubble?

2227
02:30:19,854 --> 02:30:23,721
LIAM: You know what would make you move pretty
fast is a lady rogue with a flying broom.

2228
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:28,591
LAURA: That's true, I could be hiding behind you
and drag you.

2229
02:30:28,591 --> 02:30:30,458
TALIESIN: Could have a rope tied to him.

2230
02:30:30,458 --> 02:30:33,422
MATT: However, Polymorph is any beast form, if I
recall.

2231
02:30:33,422 --> 02:30:36,923
SAM: It can't be a man? He's not a beast, that
guy?

2232
02:30:36,923 --> 02:30:45,098
MATT: A "beast." Yeah, this, you'd be looking at
more of an illusion-based spell like Alter Self.

2233
02:30:45,098 --> 02:30:49,585
SAM: Oh, well I don't have that. Oh, I have the
hat, but it doesn't make me grow, does it?

2234
02:30:49,585 --> 02:30:51,740
MATT: No, you'd be a very, very tiny goliath.

2235
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:58,332
LIAM: Maybe they'd think it was perspective
fuckery like in the Lord of the Rings movies.

2236
02:30:58,332 --> 02:31:00,760
SAM: Well, backup plan, I can go in as dead
Reginald.

2237
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:04,250
LIAM: His dad is much better.

2238
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:07,573
SAM: They killed him, they just killed him,
Kevdak's son killed him, Kevdak's son knows who he is.

2239
02:31:07,573 --> 02:31:09,971
MARISHA: No. They don't care.

2240
02:31:09,971 --> 02:31:11,817
SAM: Sure he does, they just killed him two days
ago.

2241
02:31:11,817 --> 02:31:13,457
TALIESIN: Can you remember who you killed two days
ago?

2242
02:31:13,457 --> 02:31:16,220
SAM: I can, I remember all of them because I
barely kill anybody.

2243
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:19,313
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's fair. I don't think
they care who he is.

2244
02:31:19,313 --> 02:31:20,785
TRAVIS: Right.

2245
02:31:20,785 --> 02:31:25,280
TALIESIN: I think you showing up at the front
doors is the best option at this point.

2246
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:28,681
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you do it with an illusion
instead of an actual, physical person?

2247
02:31:28,681 --> 02:31:30,416
Just an illusion?

2248
02:31:30,416 --> 02:31:36,110
SAM: My illusions are small in size. I mean, I
could just go in as hey, I'm Mr. Scanlan, come

2249
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:37,308
chase after me.

2250
02:31:37,308 --> 02:31:39,561
TRAVIS: This is your trick. You pick.

2251
02:31:39,561 --> 02:31:42,702
LAURA: You could be a fucking triceratops again,
for all--

2252
02:31:42,702 --> 02:31:45,276
SAM: Are they going to chase after a triceratops,
though?

2253
02:31:45,276 --> 02:31:51,411
MARISHA: It could make theoretical sense if you're
still undead Stonejaw, because, you know,

2254
02:31:51,411 --> 02:31:53,906
decomposition I'm sure shrinks you a little bit.

2255
02:31:53,906 --> 02:31:56,035
ASHLEY: What's something that they would chase
after?

2256
02:31:56,035 --> 02:31:57,056
LIAM: Grog.

2257
02:31:57,056 --> 02:31:58,450
TRAVIS: Anything that moves.

2258
02:31:58,450 --> 02:32:04,034
MARISHA: While you guys figure it out, I'm going
to start digging a trench.

2259
02:32:04,034 --> 02:32:06,207
TALIESIN: I'll help. I'm going to get some--

2260
02:32:06,207 --> 02:32:08,954
MARISHA: No no no, I'm good. I'm good. You stay. I
don't want to blow our cover, I'm going to do this

2261
02:32:08,954 --> 02:32:10,284
all underground.

2262
02:32:10,284 --> 02:32:11,211
TALIESIN: All right.

2263
02:32:11,211 --> 02:32:15,159
MARISHA: So outside of the city I'm going to start
digging underground and I'm going to start digging

2264
02:32:15,159 --> 02:32:16,757
a trench.

2265
02:32:16,757 --> 02:32:23,504
MATT: All right. So you're using Move Earth?

2266
02:32:23,504 --> 02:32:29,419
MARISHA: I'm moving earth, I'm going to go
underground. And it lasts up to two hours.

2267
02:32:29,419 --> 02:32:30,700
MATT: You're going underground to do it?

2268
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:33,465
MARISHA: I want to go underground and tunnel
towards--

2269
02:32:33,465 --> 02:32:36,370
MATT: Okay, I see, and then create like the trench
tunnel underneath, okay.

2270
02:32:36,370 --> 02:32:41,411
MARISHA: And do-- and I want to make it really
thin to where there's a nice thin layer of earth,

2271
02:32:41,411 --> 02:32:43,991
and then I want to make it really deep.

2272
02:32:43,991 --> 02:32:49,053
MATT: Okay, Move Earth is a concentration up to
two hours.

2273
02:32:49,053 --> 02:32:57,159
MARISHA: Uh-huh, and I can concentrate on a
40-square-foot for ten minutes. And each ten

2274
02:32:57,159 --> 02:32:58,654
minutes I can change it.

2275
02:32:58,654 --> 02:33:03,302
MATT: If you're doing a 40-foot square it could be
like 20 feet lower for every 40-foot square you

2276
02:33:03,302 --> 02:33:04,511
can do, yeah.

2277
02:33:04,511 --> 02:33:05,951
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah. So real deep.

2278
02:33:05,951 --> 02:33:15,766
MATT: Okay. So we'll say over the two-hour period
you could create, for a 40-foot square, like a

2279
02:33:15,766 --> 02:33:18,132
hundred feet deep, 120 feet deep--

2280
02:33:18,132 --> 02:33:21,080
MARISHA: I want to make sure it's wide enough to
cover the whole entrance as well.

2281
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:25,799
MATT: The whole entrance? Okay. So you dig
underneath. Stealth check to get close enough.

2282
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:30,645
Because in digging, it'll take you most of that
duration to dig up to the gate.

2283
02:33:30,645 --> 02:33:33,642
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Underground.

2284
02:33:33,642 --> 02:33:37,241
MATT: Yeah. I'd say, so in order to do this, you
have to actually get fairly close before you start

2285
02:33:37,241 --> 02:33:38,399
digging down there.

2286
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:39,407
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

2287
02:33:39,407 --> 02:33:40,230
MATT: 19?

2288
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:41,645
MARISHA: And I have a stealth of 11.

2289
02:33:41,645 --> 02:33:48,505
MATT: Okay. All right, so. You make your way up
there, moving through the grass best you can. The

2290
02:33:48,505 --> 02:33:58,661
guards that are there are partially (yawns) coming
to, you begin to slowly manipulate downward into

2291
02:33:58,661 --> 02:34:04,565
the ground using a relatively untouched patch of
high grass for cover, and pushing your way

2292
02:34:04,565 --> 02:34:11,745
through. Over the next two hours, you manage to
dig a ditch, the width of this entrance is about

2293
02:34:11,745 --> 02:34:12,794
40 feet.

2294
02:34:12,794 --> 02:34:13,756
MARISHA: Okay.

2295
02:34:13,756 --> 02:34:20,410
MATT: So from end to end, if you just go straight
down from there at 20 feet per section every ten

2296
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:25,481
minutes, looking at 240 feet deep if you wanted to
go the full, although, actually, having to tunnel

2297
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:29,803
underneath would probably take-- we'll say 180
feet.

2298
02:34:29,803 --> 02:34:31,712
MARISHA: 180 feet. That'll do.

2299
02:34:31,712 --> 02:34:33,282
LAURA: Oh my god, that's amazing.

2300
02:34:33,282 --> 02:34:38,453
MARISHA: And I can make the ground thin enough to
where it's not going to support weight, yeah?

2301
02:34:38,453 --> 02:34:42,794
MATT: Yeah, you give yourself enough of a buffer
where yeah, you could, might require a bit of a

2302
02:34:42,794 --> 02:34:45,417
jolt, make an intelligence check.

2303
02:34:45,417 --> 02:34:53,156
MARISHA: Ah, jeez Louise. Ooh. 19.

2304
02:34:53,156 --> 02:34:57,145
MATT: Okay. You feel pretty confident that you've
left just enough of a surface that it would

2305
02:34:57,145 --> 02:35:02,048
support a little bit of weight and maintain its
placement. But upon the weight of maybe two

2306
02:35:02,048 --> 02:35:06,213
humanoid-sized individuals, it would probably
crumble beneath.

2307
02:35:06,213 --> 02:35:11,844
MARISHA: Cool. Cool cool cool. Did I get a little
black powder from you?

2308
02:35:11,844 --> 02:35:13,619
TALIESIN: I did, I gave you a little bit of black
powder.

2309
02:35:13,619 --> 02:35:17,910
MARISHA: Can I put a little black powder in the
top of the dirt?

2310
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:19,458
MATT: What is a little bit?

2311
02:35:19,458 --> 02:35:20,793
MARISHA: Whatever he gave me.

2312
02:35:20,793 --> 02:35:30,150
TALIESIN: I have a little bit left over. I gave
her a third of a barrel worth, like twice this.

2313
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:31,639
MATT: Okay.

2314
02:35:31,639 --> 02:35:35,025
MARISHA: So I pepper it in the top, where if it
gets hit it's going to go boom.

2315
02:35:35,025 --> 02:35:37,430
TALIESIN: I'm going to have to deal with it
eventually, but I'm fine at the moment.

2316
02:35:37,430 --> 02:35:41,006
MATT: Okay. All right. You pepper it on the earth
from underneath. Okay.

2317
02:35:41,006 --> 02:35:43,485
MARISHA: Maybe it works. Maybe. I don't know.

2318
02:35:43,485 --> 02:35:45,243
TALIESIN: If it's hit by lightning it should be
fine.

2319
02:35:45,243 --> 02:35:46,281
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2320
02:35:46,281 --> 02:35:50,802
LIAM: So Grog's father's too big for you, what
about the undead severed head of Grog's father?

2321
02:35:50,802 --> 02:35:55,037
SAM: I can make an image of that.

2322
02:35:55,037 --> 02:35:57,399
LIAM: Floating about in the air with Pike's
boots.

2323
02:35:57,399 --> 02:36:00,412
LAURA: Oh my gosh, a floating severed head?

2324
02:36:00,412 --> 02:36:03,190
LIAM: Saying nasty, nasty, nasty things at the
Herd.

2325
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:04,567
SAM: I can do that.

2326
02:36:04,567 --> 02:36:06,618
TRAVIS: But he can't move if he's wearing the
boots.

2327
02:36:06,618 --> 02:36:09,552
TALIESIN: He'll be tied to a rope. You can make it
move when it's time.

2328
02:36:09,552 --> 02:36:10,611
LAURA: Yeah.

2329
02:36:10,611 --> 02:36:12,459
LIAM: Could you pull him like a balloon?

2330
02:36:12,459 --> 02:36:14,153
SAM: I can make the head move.

2331
02:36:14,153 --> 02:36:18,899
MARISHA: Can you be a floating head inside of a
hamster ball?

2332
02:36:18,899 --> 02:36:23,160
SAM: I wouldn't need to be the head, I mean, I
can't make my body look like a head.

2333
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:25,809
LIAM: You can't? I thought you could do anything.

2334
02:36:25,809 --> 02:36:28,311
LAURA: But you can make the illusion of a head
talking.

2335
02:36:28,311 --> 02:36:31,373
SAM: I can make the illusion of a head talking.
Wizard of Oz-style.

2336
02:36:31,373 --> 02:36:33,172
LIAM: Can it follow you about?

2337
02:36:33,172 --> 02:36:35,289
MARISHA: Well, he can be on a roof.

2338
02:36:35,289 --> 02:36:37,180
SAM: It would be within 60 feet of me, I think.

2339
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:38,351
MATT: Which one?

2340
02:36:38,351 --> 02:36:39,854
SAM: Minor Illusion, I guess.

2341
02:36:39,854 --> 02:36:42,692
MATT: Minor Illusion, you could, it's a very minor
illusion.

2342
02:36:42,692 --> 02:36:43,703
SAM: I know.

2343
02:36:43,703 --> 02:36:49,281
MATT: But you could make noise escape from the
vicinity of where the head is.

2344
02:36:49,281 --> 02:36:50,699
TALIESIN: Could I assist with that?

2345
02:36:50,699 --> 02:36:52,850
SAM: Because he has Minor Illusion as well.

2346
02:36:52,850 --> 02:36:55,197
MATT: If you're close enough to it, it's
possible.

2347
02:36:55,197 --> 02:37:03,928
SAM: I could also do-- these goliaths, they don't
like wyverns. I could be a wyvern.

2348
02:37:03,928 --> 02:37:05,773
LAURA: The head is so perfect.

2349
02:37:05,773 --> 02:37:09,232
LIAM: You could be a whole wyvern, but you can't
be a goliath?

2350
02:37:09,232 --> 02:37:11,031
SAM: It's not a beast, apparently.

2351
02:37:11,031 --> 02:37:14,664
MATT: Yeah. Polymorph-- there are higher-level
spells that can let you it, but they're a little

2352
02:37:14,664 --> 02:37:15,912
out of your range.

2353
02:37:15,912 --> 02:37:18,564
SAM: A wyvern is a beast?

2354
02:37:18,564 --> 02:37:22,169
TALIESIN: Okay, we can do the head.

2355
02:37:22,169 --> 02:37:27,655
LAURA: The head. Be a head! Be a giant, floating,
severed head, I like it.

2356
02:37:27,655 --> 02:37:30,437
TALIESIN: Can you get me out of there once they
come to attack?

2357
02:37:30,437 --> 02:37:31,589
LAURA: Me?

2358
02:37:31,589 --> 02:37:32,450
TALIESIN: Yes.

2359
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:34,510
LAURA: I mean, I can use the tether and tie you to
the broom.

2360
02:37:34,510 --> 02:37:35,947
TALIESIN: I'll be the bait.

2361
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:38,209
MATT: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.

2362
02:37:38,209 --> 02:37:38,987
SAM: Huh?

2363
02:37:38,987 --> 02:37:40,442
MATT: A wyvern is a dragon, it is not a beast.

2364
02:37:40,442 --> 02:37:41,769
SAM: I cannot be a wyvern.

2365
02:37:41,769 --> 02:37:43,194
TALIESIN: I can be the bait.

2366
02:37:43,194 --> 02:37:45,278
MARISHA: With the hat? With your hat?

2367
02:37:45,278 --> 02:37:47,321
ASHLEY: How are you going to be the bait?

2368
02:37:47,321 --> 02:37:48,764
SAM: Yeah, how are you going to be the bait?

2369
02:37:48,764 --> 02:37:50,852
TALIESIN: I'm going to have the severed head of
your father talking to them.

2370
02:37:50,852 --> 02:37:53,771
SAM: Yes, I can do that too, and I can escape. You
can't.

2371
02:37:53,771 --> 02:37:55,989
TALIESIN: Up to you. All right.

2372
02:37:55,989 --> 02:37:56,913
LAURA: Do it.

2373
02:37:56,913 --> 02:37:58,511
LIAM: Do it, Scanlan, do it.

2374
02:37:58,511 --> 02:37:59,622
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

2375
02:37:59,622 --> 02:38:04,982
SAM: I mean, I can try. Might be shit. How are you
going to hide?

2376
02:38:04,982 --> 02:38:13,913
TRAVIS: Can I ask this? Let's say we pick this
gate where she's digging out this ditch. What is

2377
02:38:13,913 --> 02:38:17,659
the terrain like on the outside of the wall next
to that gate?

2378
02:38:17,659 --> 02:38:27,556
MATT: Because of the building, or the structure of
it for about 30 feet on the outside of the wall

2379
02:38:27,556 --> 02:38:36,349
it's mainly just hard-packed dirt and earth from
patrols for hundreds of years going around the

2380
02:38:36,349 --> 02:38:42,751
wall, whether it be carts, beasts of burden, or
just people walking all around the outskirts of

2381
02:38:42,751 --> 02:38:47,618
the town of Westruun, it's very heavy-packed and
often-walked earth.

2382
02:38:47,618 --> 02:38:48,874
TRAVIS: Zero cover.

2383
02:38:48,874 --> 02:38:54,459
MATT: Zero coverage within 30 feet of it, and the
grass does thin as it gets close to that. Keyleth

2384
02:38:54,459 --> 02:39:00,854
had to pick a specific area and get low and even
then had to force her way under and use a good,

2385
02:39:00,854 --> 02:39:05,432
you know, a quarter of her spell time to be able
to dig well enough to get past that space.

2386
02:39:05,432 --> 02:39:10,111
TRAVIS: Past 30 feet from the wall, from the edge
of town, what kind of cover is there?

2387
02:39:10,111 --> 02:39:11,884
Is there any?

2388
02:39:11,884 --> 02:39:13,052
MATT: Not really.

2389
02:39:13,052 --> 02:39:14,622
TRAVIS: Not even the tall grass?

2390
02:39:14,622 --> 02:39:20,006
MATT: The grass at that point gets about waist- to
knee-high, even less so.

2391
02:39:20,006 --> 02:39:25,808
TRAVIS: This is an important thing we need to
remember. As we're doing all this, let's just

2392
02:39:25,808 --> 02:39:32,042
assume that we're us and this'll all go tits-up
real quick. We're going to be a fucking long way

2393
02:39:32,042 --> 02:39:35,813
away from you before we can come to help.

2394
02:39:35,813 --> 02:39:41,588
SAM: That's why you're going to send Pike with me.
No, I'm just kidding, I would never.

2395
02:39:41,588 --> 02:39:46,623
LIAM: No, but my sister or I could go with you.
One of us.

2396
02:39:46,623 --> 02:39:49,026
SAM: That would make me feel quite nice.

2397
02:39:49,026 --> 02:39:51,210
TALIESIN: Sister's good for an escape route.

2398
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:56,391
TRAVIS: We should at least find a forward
operating base, a place where we can watch this

2399
02:39:56,391 --> 02:40:02,277
unfold from cover and figure out how far away we
are from the first act of our show.

2400
02:40:02,277 --> 02:40:06,054
TALIESIN: Well, if everything goes wrong we meet
back here at the very least.

2401
02:40:06,054 --> 02:40:10,619
MARISHA: I mean, theoretically we'll be stationed
throughout, and we'll have

2402
02:40:10,619 --> 02:40:12,245
our earpieces, correct?

2403
02:40:12,245 --> 02:40:16,154
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I'm just talking about, what
if we have to para-rescue his ass

2404
02:40:16,154 --> 02:40:17,755
out of a fucking pickle?

2405
02:40:17,755 --> 02:40:19,098
TALIESIN: That's what Vex is for.

2406
02:40:19,098 --> 02:40:26,071
LAURA: I'm standing nearby on my broom. I'll fly
in and pick him up. He can Dimension Door out,

2407
02:40:26,071 --> 02:40:27,552
though, very quickly.

2408
02:40:27,552 --> 02:40:31,995
MARISHA: I also have both of my beast shaping,
still, so I can always fly in and evac you.

2409
02:40:31,995 --> 02:40:34,062
TRAVIS: How far away are we from the entrance
now?

2410
02:40:34,062 --> 02:40:36,682
MATT: As you guys have plotted this, and Keyleth
has come back to you through the grass after

2411
02:40:36,682 --> 02:40:40,214
creating this tunnel, I'd say you're about 150,
200 feet out.

2412
02:40:40,214 --> 02:40:41,574
TALIESIN: That's perfect.

2413
02:40:41,574 --> 02:40:43,207
SAM: And we know Westruun.

2414
02:40:43,207 --> 02:40:44,635
MATT: Yeah, you know it well.

2415
02:40:44,635 --> 02:40:48,135
SAM: And I know how far away from the center of
town are we--

2416
02:40:48,135 --> 02:40:50,312
TRAVIS: Wait a minute, are there sewers in
Westruun?

2417
02:40:50,312 --> 02:40:51,171
MATT: Yeah.

2418
02:40:51,171 --> 02:40:53,361
LAURA: It's okay.

2419
02:40:53,361 --> 02:40:55,452
TRAVIS: I don't know.

2420
02:40:55,452 --> 02:40:57,062
TALIESIN: We have that option if it comes to it.

2421
02:40:57,062 --> 02:40:58,643
TRAVIS: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

2422
02:40:58,643 --> 02:41:02,134
TALIESIN: It's all right. And again, like any good
plan, everything will go wrong.

2423
02:41:02,134 --> 02:41:03,247
LAURA: Yes.

2424
02:41:03,247 --> 02:41:05,303
LAURA and MARISHA: Let's do it!

2425
02:41:05,303 --> 02:41:06,559
TALIESIN: It's time.

2426
02:41:06,559 --> 02:41:15,318
MATT: The grass dies, begins to die away, and
become in-- not helpful for stealth about 80,

2427
02:41:15,318 --> 02:41:17,167
70-80 feet outside the wall.

2428
02:41:17,167 --> 02:41:19,702
MARISHA: Can we get a Pass Without a Trace while
we all get to our positions?

2429
02:41:19,702 --> 02:41:21,538
LAURA: Fuck yeah.

2430
02:41:21,538 --> 02:41:24,959
MATT: Okay. Pass Without a Trace, even so, you
can't stealth in the open. In order to stealth,

2431
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:30,524
you have to have some way of staying out of sight.
Once you get to about 70 feet from the wall, it's

2432
02:41:30,524 --> 02:41:37,326
basically just open ground and the large wall that
surrounds Westruun.

2433
02:41:37,326 --> 02:41:38,661
MARISHA: I could give us a fog cloud.

2434
02:41:38,661 --> 02:41:47,077
LAURA: Can you dig a hole under and we can hang
out in a hole with something over top of it so we

2435
02:41:47,077 --> 02:41:49,167
can bust up out, like shallow ground?

2436
02:41:49,167 --> 02:41:57,951
MARISHA: I've already burned it. I mean, we can
still go underground, I have a tunnel built to a

2437
02:41:57,951 --> 02:41:59,750
certain point.

2438
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:03,240
LAURA: But we have to be able to get out of it.

2439
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:07,859
TALIESIN: Let's just keep our distance, let's get
them out of the castle and coming out at us.

2440
02:42:07,859 --> 02:42:09,921
LAURA: Okay. And then we go in.

2441
02:42:09,921 --> 02:42:12,026
MATT: Okay. So. What's the plan? Who's doing
what?

2442
02:42:12,026 --> 02:42:14,626
SAM: I go invisible and start walking into town.

2443
02:42:14,626 --> 02:42:17,346
LAURA: We stay at the very edge, stealthed as
fuck.

2444
02:42:17,346 --> 02:42:22,792
TALIESIN: You're not going into town, why are you
going into town? We dug a giant pit in front of

2445
02:42:22,792 --> 02:42:24,300
the main entrance.

2446
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:28,615
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone be mindful of the pit, I
point it out to everyone where the pit is so we

2447
02:42:28,615 --> 02:42:29,791
can go around it.

2448
02:42:29,791 --> 02:42:33,382
MATT: Okay. To be fair, yeah, and he is a gnome.
He is not a very heavy individual. And you were

2449
02:42:33,382 --> 02:42:38,311
pretty spot-on-- You're fairly certain it can support
the weight of a gnome.

2450
02:42:38,311 --> 02:42:47,326
MARISHA: I can Polymorph a couple people. No.
Sorry. I can Polymorph one person as a stealth

2451
02:42:47,326 --> 02:42:48,868
kind of deal.

2452
02:42:48,868 --> 02:42:52,920
MATT: There are the three guards there, about 20
feet in from the main gate, or the main

2453
02:42:52,920 --> 02:43:01,870
entranceway, one of which appears to be a female
goliath, muscular scar-based torso, very thick,

2454
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:06,768
dark, dreaded hair that's pulled tightly to the
back of her head and hangs down to the mid-back,

2455
02:43:06,768 --> 02:43:12,916
and you see two humans that are also as
rugged-looking, possibly members of the secondary

2456
02:43:12,916 --> 02:43:18,322
tribe that they adopted, as was mentioned when you
first inquired about the tribe as it currently

2457
02:43:18,322 --> 02:43:26,910
stands, the Herd. They're all just looking out,
bored, one of them is chewing on some dried meat,

2458
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:30,929
and they're just keeping an eye out. Scanlan,
you've gone invisible and you're approaching the

2459
02:43:30,929 --> 02:43:32,336
front gate. What are you doing?

2460
02:43:32,336 --> 02:43:35,694
SAM: Hey, can you cast Pass Without a Trace on
me?

2461
02:43:35,694 --> 02:43:37,189
LAURA: I already did!

2462
02:43:37,189 --> 02:43:38,968
SAM: Okay, good. I'm just going to walk in,
straight into town.

2463
02:43:38,968 --> 02:43:44,206
MATT: Okay. Yeah. Just for the sake of this, go
ahead and make a stealth check. With advantage.

2464
02:43:44,206 --> 02:43:45,456
SAM: With advantage.

2465
02:43:45,456 --> 02:43:48,252
MATT: Yeah, they have very little chance to even
notice.

2466
02:43:48,252 --> 02:43:49,776
SAM: So 16 plus--

2467
02:43:49,776 --> 02:43:50,733
LAURA: Ten.

2468
02:43:50,733 --> 02:43:52,804
SAM: Plus two. So 28.

2469
02:43:52,804 --> 02:43:55,829
MATT: Yeah. Given the circumstance that you're
invisible and that advantage roll, even the

2470
02:43:55,829 --> 02:44:02,508
quietness of your footsteps, you manage to
literally walk within five feet of them without

2471
02:44:02,508 --> 02:44:10,083
them noticing. You hear some low mutters, some of
it's just like broken words, "Stupid hungry--" And

2472
02:44:10,083 --> 02:44:20,217
the larger female goliath is like, "Shut up. Eyes
peeled. I hate this." They look very unhappy about

2473
02:44:20,217 --> 02:44:25,698
having to be stuck there at this watch. So you've
moved past them, now.

2474
02:44:25,698 --> 02:44:30,257
SAM: All right, I'm going to go into the-- just
the center. We had a scouting party go in and see

2475
02:44:30,257 --> 02:44:34,891
that-- yes we did, yes we did. It was the center
of town, and that's where the key people were

2476
02:44:34,891 --> 02:44:37,167
around, milling about.

2477
02:44:37,167 --> 02:44:41,417
MATT: Yeah, the very center of town is about a
15-minute walk from the outside of town.

2478
02:44:41,417 --> 02:44:43,006
TALIESIN: We can hear everything that happens.

2479
02:44:43,006 --> 02:44:44,324
MATT: How long does your invisibility last?

2480
02:44:44,324 --> 02:44:45,308
SAM: An hour.

2481
02:44:45,308 --> 02:44:50,375
MATT: An hour. Okay. You start coasting through
the town, you come towards a T-intersection of

2482
02:44:50,375 --> 02:44:55,597
where the road continues forward and turns to the
right, you can see a number of the buildings, just

2483
02:44:55,597 --> 02:45:01,222
like you saw previously on you guys' journey, some
of them are charred and black from fires that have

2484
02:45:01,222 --> 02:45:05,708
been set. Some of them, you do notice as you pass
by, large elements of the buildings have just

2485
02:45:05,708 --> 02:45:11,802
dissolved, melted down by some sort of chemical
reaction. Many buildings still stand. You do see

2486
02:45:11,802 --> 02:45:16,047
that there are broken barrels and crates in the
streets, it looks like a lot of what may have been

2487
02:45:16,047 --> 02:45:22,288
in storage or being brought around as commerce has
been ransacked and raided or relocated. You do see

2488
02:45:22,288 --> 02:45:25,808
a couple carts that are half-broken or just up on
the side, with whatever's on the inside pulled

2489
02:45:25,808 --> 02:45:32,810
out. You do manage to see a couple of horses that
were killed during some altercation that were just

2490
02:45:32,810 --> 02:45:38,180
left rotting in the middle of the street. There
are no people visible on the street. Make a

2491
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:39,614
perception check.

2492
02:45:39,614 --> 02:45:40,941
LAURA: What time is it?

2493
02:45:40,941 --> 02:45:47,760
MATT: At this point now? In the two hours for you
to do that digging, it's close to 10:30, 11:00 in

2494
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,091
the morning.

2495
02:45:49,091 --> 02:45:51,255
SAM: 13.

2496
02:45:51,255 --> 02:45:59,136
MATT: 13. Okay. You keep walking past, you don't
notice anything that catches your attention. You

2497
02:45:59,136 --> 02:46:06,676
keep moving towards the center of the town. You
start moving through the religious district of the

2498
02:46:06,676 --> 02:46:08,548
middle of Westruun. Make another perception
check.

2499
02:46:08,548 --> 02:46:10,681
SAM: 19.

2500
02:46:10,681 --> 02:46:11,938
TALIESIN: Plus.

2501
02:46:11,938 --> 02:46:13,009
SAM: Nothing.

2502
02:46:13,009 --> 02:46:23,054
MATT: 19. You glance by what you knew previously
in Westruun as the central church of Erathis

2503
02:46:23,054 --> 02:46:31,493
there. It's a rather, in comparison to the rest of
the town, a gaudy temple. But it has been defiled

2504
02:46:31,493 --> 02:46:39,356
fairly heavily. You can see paint, mud, or some
other substance has been smeared across parts of

2505
02:46:39,356 --> 02:46:46,990
it, portions of the rock have been pushed over and
collapsed. You do glance and see a small humanoid

2506
02:46:46,990 --> 02:46:55,242
peeking through one of the ajar doors that you
see, for a second you see a set of eyes, then it

2507
02:46:55,242 --> 02:46:56,998
sees you and closes the door.

2508
02:46:56,998 --> 02:46:59,332
LAURA: It saw you?

2509
02:46:59,332 --> 02:47:11,034
SAM: Oh, shit. Fuck, he knows I'm there, I got to
keep going. I got to keep going, yeah.

2510
02:47:11,034 --> 02:47:12,368
LAURA: You're invisible!

2511
02:47:12,368 --> 02:47:14,126
SAM: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah.

2512
02:47:14,126 --> 02:47:22,311
MATT: You keep moving towards the very, very
center of town, moving past a couple of other

2513
02:47:22,311 --> 02:47:28,017
patrols. You've passed, even in just this journey
into the center of-- journey to the center of

2514
02:47:28,017 --> 02:47:38,158
Westruun-- you've passed roughly 30 or so
well-armed, relatively savage individuals that

2515
02:47:38,158 --> 02:47:45,825
mark the same civilized level of Grog, give or
take some further steps into society. Many of them

2516
02:47:45,825 --> 02:47:50,609
are wearing pieces of clothing that have been
taken from this town, they're dressed better than

2517
02:47:50,609 --> 02:47:55,349
their station, you know, rough-looking, big,
thick, unshaven faces for the humans, but they're

2518
02:47:55,349 --> 02:48:02,072
still like dressed in pompous clothing that's
partially torn and smeared. They're a walking

2519
02:48:02,072 --> 02:48:07,476
parody of the people that once ruled this town,
and they seem to know it. They're enjoying this

2520
02:48:07,476 --> 02:48:15,208
gloating. Eventually you make your way to the
central town square, which is not far from where

2521
02:48:15,208 --> 02:48:24,010
the Margrave's home is. This area, you do notice,
has been set up as a defensive central location.

2522
02:48:24,010 --> 02:48:28,862
There are just barriers and barricades of all
sorts of furniture that have been nailed together

2523
02:48:28,862 --> 02:48:34,498
and this has been made an assault post, where if
anyone were to attempt to attack the center of

2524
02:48:34,498 --> 02:48:41,365
this town, this would be a wonderful defensive
position for someone to hole up and wait it out,

2525
02:48:41,365 --> 02:48:48,231
whether it be against other people or a dragon. It
has been built with the best of their ability in

2526
02:48:48,231 --> 02:48:51,776
that regard. And there are a number of weapons
that they've taken from the city that have been

2527
02:48:51,776 --> 02:48:58,154
bolted in, that have been strapped around, so
there's just like jagged edges of halberds and

2528
02:48:58,154 --> 02:49:02,598
whatever blades they could muster in every
direction, therefore if anything wasn't being very

2529
02:49:02,598 --> 02:49:09,086
careful and running through here, they could be
easily shoved into one of these hazards or perhaps

2530
02:49:09,086 --> 02:49:15,776
even pushed onto it as a means of display. Which
you do notice, on a number of these, various heads

2531
02:49:15,776 --> 02:49:24,819
are currently placed as warning symbols, in
varying states of decay. You recognize two of the

2532
02:49:24,819 --> 02:49:29,316
heads. One of which is--

2533
02:49:29,316 --> 02:49:34,239
LAURA: No no no no no.

2534
02:49:34,239 --> 02:49:39,510
MATT: Sorry. One of them you recognize as the
Margrave who once ruled Westruun, whose home

2535
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:50,652
Kevdak currently keeps as his own. And the other,
let's see if I can recall what this one is. I have

2536
02:49:50,652 --> 02:49:52,194
it written down here.

2537
02:49:52,194 --> 02:49:55,326
TALIESIN: I like that this is that deep in your
notes, is which heads are on spikes.

2538
02:49:55,326 --> 02:49:57,371
MATT: Hey, man, got to keep up with this.

2539
02:49:57,371 --> 02:50:01,838
SAM: Appendix A: Heads on Spikes, Various.

2540
02:50:01,838 --> 02:50:03,770
MATT: (laughs) Pretty much.

2541
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:06,484
SAM: Subappendix: Westruun.

2542
02:50:06,484 --> 02:50:16,670
MATT: Ah, okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay.
Loran the Bear. Loran the Bear was a mercenary

2543
02:50:16,670 --> 02:50:24,567
that you guys faced off with the first time that
you fought in the brawlers' league. You guys had a

2544
02:50:24,567 --> 02:50:28,586
playful rivalry? You kept running into each other
when looking for various--

2545
02:50:28,586 --> 02:50:32,531
TALIESIN: It's like a best of season one, that's
great.

2546
02:50:32,531 --> 02:50:35,171
SAM and TALIESIN: The season that didn't air.

2547
02:50:35,171 --> 02:50:43,225
MATT: But there you see him, or what remains of
him, placed on one of these weapons. It looks like

2548
02:50:43,225 --> 02:50:46,894
anybody who has attempted to rise up or at least
make a stink about the current ruling class in

2549
02:50:46,894 --> 02:50:51,206
Westruun have been put on display in this square
in some way, shape, or form.

2550
02:50:51,206 --> 02:50:54,830
SAM: Are there any people? Guards? Goliaths?

2551
02:50:54,830 --> 02:51:06,351
MATT: You see a rather heavy group of well-armored
goliaths and other savage-looking humanoid

2552
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:11,979
individuals. Mostly human, you see a couple
half-orcs, but it's a total of ten of them that

2553
02:51:11,979 --> 02:51:16,848
are all currently scattered throughout this
central area, some of them just sitting down,

2554
02:51:16,848 --> 02:51:22,164
snacking, a few that are just keeping watch, and a
number that are hovering in and out of the door of

2555
02:51:22,164 --> 02:51:25,520
the main area, giving orders and carrying some
small supplies around.

2556
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:29,020
SAM: Okay. So I'll just quickly-- are you guys
ready?

2557
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:36,715
MARISHA: Do we want to get up on the wall? There's
like a wall, right, around the city?

2558
02:51:36,715 --> 02:51:38,780
SAM: Yeah, but I'm in the center of the city.

2559
02:51:38,780 --> 02:51:42,911
MATT: Right. Also, there's no response.

2560
02:51:42,911 --> 02:51:46,244
LAURA: Oh, he's out of range. Shit.

2561
02:51:46,244 --> 02:51:50,365
SAM: Do you know what the range is on that?

2562
02:51:50,365 --> 02:51:54,583
MATT: The range on those earpieces are roughly two
miles.

2563
02:51:54,583 --> 02:51:56,171
SAM: Two miles.

2564
02:51:56,171 --> 02:51:59,381
LAURA: He's out of two miles' range?

2565
02:51:59,381 --> 02:52:01,391
MATT: Well yeah, Westruun's a pretty big town, and
it's--

2566
02:52:01,391 --> 02:52:02,971
LAURA: It's a 15-minute walk, though.

2567
02:52:02,971 --> 02:52:04,279
SAM: Yeah, I walk fast.

2568
02:52:04,279 --> 02:52:05,579
LAURA: You're a fast walker for a gnome.

2569
02:52:05,579 --> 02:52:07,365
MARISHA: He really is a really fast walker.

2570
02:52:07,365 --> 02:52:08,543
TALIESIN: Okay, go ahead.

2571
02:52:08,543 --> 02:52:12,042
MARISHA: I cast Polymorph on Percy and turn him
into a crow.

2572
02:52:12,042 --> 02:52:13,416
TALIESIN: (eerily good crow noise)

2573
02:52:13,416 --> 02:52:15,317
LAURA: Oh, again with the crows.

2574
02:52:15,317 --> 02:52:20,211
MARISHA: Also, I use my beast shape to go into a
crow. (crow noise)

2575
02:52:20,211 --> 02:52:21,687
TALIESIN: (eerily good crow noise)

2576
02:52:21,687 --> 02:52:22,652
MARISHA: (crow noise)

2577
02:52:22,652 --> 02:52:24,057
TALIESIN: That's good enough, that's good.

2578
02:52:24,057 --> 02:52:29,265
MARISHA: And we fly to the walls and perch on
opposite sides on the entrance.

2579
02:52:29,265 --> 02:52:30,649
MATT: Okay.

2580
02:52:30,649 --> 02:52:33,998
LAURA: Look, your god is here to help us.

2581
02:52:33,998 --> 02:52:35,222
MARISHA: (crow noises)

2582
02:52:35,222 --> 02:52:37,291
LAURA: She sounds like shit.

2583
02:52:37,291 --> 02:52:41,585
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (a panoply of crow noises)

2584
02:52:41,585 --> 02:52:42,778
MATT: Stop it.

2585
02:52:42,778 --> 02:52:43,812
TALIESIN: Sorry.

2586
02:52:43,812 --> 02:52:45,541
(laughter)

2587
02:52:45,541 --> 02:52:46,583
TALIESIN: It's really pleasing.

2588
02:52:46,583 --> 02:52:49,105
MATT: All right. You guys are perched on the edges
of that. Scanlan, what're you doing?

2589
02:52:49,105 --> 02:52:57,064
SAM: So much. So much.

2590
02:52:57,064 --> 02:52:59,313
LAURA: I feel like this is the first time I've
seen you at a loss.

2591
02:52:59,313 --> 02:53:02,711
TRAVIS: Look at those eyes.

2592
02:53:02,711 --> 02:53:04,010
LAURA: Oh god.

2593
02:53:04,010 --> 02:53:05,779
TALIESIN: Don't you want her to read the note?

2594
02:53:05,779 --> 02:53:13,218
SAM: Yeah, I go over to where the most people are
congregated.

2595
02:53:13,218 --> 02:53:16,971
MATT: That's going to be right at the steps of the
Margrave's manor.

2596
02:53:16,971 --> 02:53:20,122
SAM: I position myself about seven feet away from
them.

2597
02:53:20,122 --> 02:53:21,124
MATT: Okay.

2598
02:53:21,124 --> 02:53:24,213
SAM: And I cast Thunderwave.

2599
02:53:24,213 --> 02:53:36,151
MATT: And with that, (explosion), this burst of
thunder comes blasting out centrally from where

2600
02:53:36,151 --> 02:53:40,727
you are located, Scanlan. The DC on this, with
your--

2601
02:53:40,727 --> 02:53:45,046
SAM: Thunderwave. Oh, is it spell?

2602
02:53:45,046 --> 02:53:46,408
MATT: It's spell, what's your DC?

2603
02:53:46,408 --> 02:53:47,387
SAM: 20.

2604
02:53:47,387 --> 02:53:48,519
MATT: 20.

2605
02:53:48,519 --> 02:53:56,121
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

2606
02:53:56,121 --> 02:54:07,522
MATT: Okay. Six fail, one succeeds on this
save. So you hit them and they're all forced

2607
02:54:07,522 --> 02:54:12,417
backwards, some of them up onto the stairs, some
against the wall. Roll 2d8 points of damage.

2608
02:54:12,417 --> 02:54:13,858
LIAM: Ragdoll physics.

2609
02:54:13,858 --> 02:54:14,926
SAM: 2d8?

2610
02:54:14,926 --> 02:54:15,837
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2611
02:54:15,837 --> 02:54:19,785
SAM: No, it's-- oh, that's, you're right.

2612
02:54:19,785 --> 02:54:20,974
MATT: Yeah.

2613
02:54:20,974 --> 02:54:23,223
SAM: 11 plus something? No, I guess it's just 11.

2614
02:54:23,223 --> 02:54:34,249
MATT: It's just 11. All right, and one of them
takes five points of damage and (impact sound)

2615
02:54:34,249 --> 02:54:36,490
looks down at this little gnome that's there.

2616
02:54:36,490 --> 02:54:39,990
SAM: No, no, I'm still invisible. It's not a
concentration spell.

2617
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:45,163
MATT: Invisibility, I'm pretty sure that as soon
as you do--

2618
02:54:45,163 --> 02:54:46,373
SAM: Oh, fuck.

2619
02:54:46,373 --> 02:54:52,213
MATT: The spell ends for a target that attacks or
casts a spell.

2620
02:54:52,213 --> 02:54:54,501
SAM: Casts a spell?

2621
02:54:54,501 --> 02:54:55,391
MATT: Yeah.

2622
02:54:55,391 --> 02:54:57,241
SAM: Even though it's a concentration spell?

2623
02:54:57,241 --> 02:55:00,812
MATT: Yeah, you can cast other instantaneous
spells, but as soon as you cast a spell

2624
02:55:00,812 --> 02:55:02,230
you become visible.

2625
02:55:02,230 --> 02:55:03,254
SAM: What?

2626
02:55:03,254 --> 02:55:05,801
MATT: High-level invisibility, improved
invisibility is the one that remains.

2627
02:55:05,801 --> 02:55:07,038
SAM: Oh well, I'm fucked, then.

2628
02:55:07,038 --> 02:55:08,653
(laughter)

2629
02:55:08,653 --> 02:55:09,794
TALIESIN: Yes!

2630
02:55:09,794 --> 02:55:13,342
MATT: I'll say, do you have Greater Invisibility?

2631
02:55:13,342 --> 02:55:17,686
SAM: No. I can cast it at a greater level, but no,
I don't have Greater Invisibility.

2632
02:55:17,686 --> 02:55:21,446
MATT: Yeah, at that moment you suddenly become
visible.

2633
02:55:21,446 --> 02:55:22,511
TALIESIN: Roll with it, roll with it.

2634
02:55:22,511 --> 02:55:23,778
SAM: Hi guys. Hi.

2635
02:55:23,778 --> 02:55:26,341
MARISHA: But you're Scanlan, you can do this.

2636
02:55:26,341 --> 02:55:32,321
MATT: The surprise round, they weren't expecting
it. Roll initiative right now.

2637
02:55:32,321 --> 02:55:33,726
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2638
02:55:33,726 --> 02:55:35,452
LAURA: Oh my god, Scanlan, run.

2639
02:55:35,452 --> 02:55:37,535
SAM: 16.

2640
02:55:37,535 --> 02:55:42,132
MATT: Rolled a one. I'm rolling them group
initiative on this one, because I don't want to

2641
02:55:42,132 --> 02:55:52,537
roll six different initiatives in this order. They
all look at you dumbfounded. "We got an intruder!"

2642
02:55:52,537 --> 02:55:58,846
Pull out their weapons, get ready. Two of them
(growl) at you really angrily.

2643
02:55:58,846 --> 02:56:00,340
What are you doing?

2644
02:56:00,340 --> 02:56:01,580
SAM: Fuck!

2645
02:56:01,580 --> 02:56:04,823
MATT: What are you doing, Sam?

2646
02:56:04,823 --> 02:56:08,725
SAM: This is not the plan!

2647
02:56:08,725 --> 02:56:10,869
TALIESIN: No! No!

2648
02:56:10,869 --> 02:56:12,727
TRAVIS: Don't say a thing, don't say shit.

2649
02:56:12,727 --> 02:56:14,936
LAURA: Okay, yeah yeah, it's all you.

2650
02:56:14,936 --> 02:56:18,716
SAM: (mock-crying)

2651
02:56:18,716 --> 02:56:22,584
At least I know that Pike didn't read the
letter, though, so I'm okay.

2652
02:56:22,584 --> 02:56:25,178
(laughter)

2653
02:56:25,178 --> 02:56:28,595
TALIESIN: At the end of this fight, can I have
your tie? I mean, you're not going to need it

2654
02:56:28,595 --> 02:56:29,559
anymore.

2655
02:56:29,559 --> 02:56:31,073
TRAVIS: Come on, what are you doing?

2656
02:56:31,073 --> 02:56:40,616
SAM: Okay. I'll Dimension Door into the house
where the guy's eyeballs were.

2657
02:56:40,616 --> 02:56:42,398
TRAVIS: Yes! I like it.

2658
02:56:42,398 --> 02:56:43,878
MATT: Wait, on the, to the house--

2659
02:56:43,878 --> 02:56:47,883
SAM: The house where I saw the guy who was peeking
and saw me, he saw me, I'm going in there.

2660
02:56:47,883 --> 02:56:49,068
MATT: Oh!

2661
02:56:49,068 --> 02:56:50,077
LAURA: What?

2662
02:56:50,077 --> 02:56:51,079
LIAM: Smart.

2663
02:56:51,079 --> 02:56:52,498
MATT: How far is the range on Dimension Door?

2664
02:56:52,498 --> 02:56:54,843
SAM: 500 feet. Was that long ago or recently?

2665
02:56:54,843 --> 02:56:57,990
MATT: Wait, so. You were peeking, are you
referring to the--

2666
02:56:57,990 --> 02:57:00,094
SAM: The guy who saw me as invisible.

2667
02:57:00,094 --> 02:57:08,749
MATT: Right. Okay, got you. All right, so you're
going to that temple. That's probably about 1000

2668
02:57:08,749 --> 02:57:13,188
feet from you, you can Dimension Door closer to
it.

2669
02:57:13,188 --> 02:57:20,776
SAM: Yes, I could. I could. Okay, okay. This is
exciting, this is so exciting, nothing's working.

2670
02:57:20,776 --> 02:57:25,790
Okay, yes, I will go toward it 500 feet.

2671
02:57:25,790 --> 02:57:33,044
MATT: Okay. You appear to the back end and around
the road, just around the corner from where the

2672
02:57:33,044 --> 02:57:38,474
entrance to that area is, so you're a little ways
away. As you appear, catching your breath, you

2673
02:57:38,474 --> 02:57:43,534
look over your shoulder and you hear in the
distance more, a couple yells, and a bell starts

2674
02:57:43,534 --> 02:57:46,380
going off (ringing) in the center of the town
square.

2675
02:57:46,380 --> 02:57:47,589
SAM: It's going great, guys.

2676
02:57:47,589 --> 02:57:48,686
LAURA: Do we hear the bell?

2677
02:57:48,686 --> 02:57:52,409
MATT: You guys can hear in the very distance a
series of bells beginning to go (ringing).

2678
02:57:52,409 --> 02:57:53,575
TALIESIN: Oh, sweet Jesus.

2679
02:57:53,575 --> 02:57:54,847
MATT: What're you doing now?

2680
02:57:54,847 --> 02:57:56,909
SAM: Well, they haven't caught up to me, right?

2681
02:57:56,909 --> 02:58:01,133
MATT: No no, you just moved 500 feet in one
second, they have no idea where you went. You just

2682
02:58:01,133 --> 02:58:03,863
showed up, went "Bye!" and vanished out.

2683
02:58:03,863 --> 02:58:06,718
LIAM: Bell is bad. He's in trouble, we need to go
in now.

2684
02:58:06,718 --> 02:58:09,437
SAM: I'm going to go again, Dimension Door into
the temple.

2685
02:58:09,437 --> 02:58:14,106
MATT: Okay, you do see the temple. You're on the
interior of it now, and looking inside you know a

2686
02:58:14,106 --> 02:58:20,347
portion of it is collapsed, there's an open view
on the second level where a whole corner of the

2687
02:58:20,347 --> 02:58:25,238
secondary floor and first floor have fallen in,
big pile of rubble, you can see the sky. There as

2688
02:58:25,238 --> 02:58:31,023
you appear, you look around, you hear a series of gasps as you
can now see huddled inside of this temple roughly

2689
02:58:31,023 --> 02:58:38,604
30 or so people, varying ages, varying racial
backgrounds. These are some of the survivors in

2690
02:58:38,604 --> 02:58:42,821
Westruun that are keeping in here, whether it be
hidden, or at least this is where they live now.

2691
02:58:42,821 --> 02:58:51,758
They look in various states of personal brutality
that's been put against them, some of them are

2692
02:58:51,758 --> 02:59:00,052
wounded, a few of them draw weapons immediately,
and turning around, you see hunkered down inside a

2693
02:59:00,052 --> 02:59:10,602
half-orc that rushes around, his hat half-kilter,
his coat up with his shoulder, mantle part of his

2694
02:59:10,602 --> 02:59:14,319
collar pressed upward, spins around, puts his
blade out.

2695
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:19,840
"You've got to be kidding me. Scanlan Shorthalt."

2696
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:21,278
SAM: That's me.

2697
02:59:21,278 --> 02:59:22,861
MATT: As Dr. Dranzel stands there before you.

2698
02:59:22,861 --> 02:59:25,621
(cheering)

2699
02:59:25,621 --> 02:59:30,212
MATT: They themselves look a little worse for
wear, and he looks over his shoulder and says,

2700
02:59:30,212 --> 02:59:37,849
"Well shit, Kaylie, weren't you just talking about
him yesterday?" As your daughter stands behind

2701
02:59:37,849 --> 02:59:44,087
him, holding two of the children, trying to
protect them as you appeared. She looks up at you

2702
02:59:44,087 --> 02:59:47,844
and goes, "Oh, you've got to be kidding me."

2703
02:59:47,844 --> 02:59:49,522
And that's where we'll end tonight's game.

2704
02:59:49,522 --> 02:59:51,926
(yelling)

2705
02:59:51,926 --> 02:59:56,761
TRAVIS: Perfect! Perfect, perfect.

2706
02:59:56,761 --> 02:59:59,452
TALIESIN: Put that on like a Japanese
businessman.

2707
02:59:59,452 --> 03:00:11,428
LIAM: By the way, this one, under her breath,
goes, "Oh I don't like him, he stole from me."

2708
03:00:11,428 --> 03:00:14,724
SAM: That's all you can think about?

2709
03:00:14,724 --> 03:00:16,235
LAURA: Why am I cheering? He stole from us.

2710
03:00:16,235 --> 03:00:17,815
SAM: They're going to fucking save my life.

2711
03:00:17,815 --> 03:00:19,281
LIAM: Well, maybe he needed it to save the world.

2712
03:00:19,281 --> 03:00:23,404
MATT: It's all survival. All right, then we'll
pick it up from there next week.

2713
03:00:23,404 --> 03:00:26,455
TRAVIS: Jesus. That was a hell of a 50th. Fuck's
sake!

2714
03:00:26,455 --> 03:00:28,952
TALIESIN: Why did we even bother to plan?

2715
03:00:28,952 --> 03:00:31,452
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Why do we even bother to
plan?

2716
03:00:31,452 --> 03:00:38,852
TRAVIS: It's going perfect! It's going perfectly.
We are still on the rails. It is working.

2717
03:00:38,852 --> 03:00:40,858
TALIESIN: We are still on the rails, it'll be
great.

2718
03:00:40,858 --> 03:00:43,898
MARISHA: I spent a 6th-level spell building that
trench, it had better come in handy.

2719
03:00:43,898 --> 03:00:45,306
ASHLEY: It will, it will.

2720
03:00:45,306 --> 03:00:48,161
TALIESIN: We're all going to fall and die in it,
it's going to be great.

2721
03:00:48,161 --> 03:00:49,845
LIAM: Scanlan is drunken master.

2722
03:00:49,845 --> 03:00:54,391
MATT: All righty, guys, we're going to go ahead
and take a few minutes here to hunker down and

2723
03:00:54,391 --> 03:01:03,182
prepare for the savage unwrapping of many presents
that you, the community of Critical Role, have put

2724
03:01:03,182 --> 03:01:11,203
in our direction. All of us so eternally
undeserving, but so incredibly appreciative of all

2725
03:01:11,203 --> 03:01:17,106
that you guys do, both to help with the charities
that we support and spend your time being so

2726
03:01:17,106 --> 03:01:19,651
awesome and creative and we're going to go ahead
and--

2727
03:01:19,651 --> 03:01:24,990
SAM: Matt, though, but what are we going to do
with the minutes while we're not on camera right

2728
03:01:24,990 --> 03:01:28,982
now? How do we fill the airtime?

2729
03:01:28,982 --> 03:01:34,110
MATT: We'll, I'm sure, have a few videos to show
that may also include our new intro.

2730
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:37,999
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and LAURA: Again! Again!

2731
03:01:37,999 --> 03:01:41,278
MARISHA: We're mainly doing this for our own
selfishness.

2732
03:01:41,278 --> 05:55:44,020
