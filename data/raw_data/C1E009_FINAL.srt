MATT: Welcome and good evening, everyone. Welcome
to this week's episode of Critical Role, where a

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,173
bunch of us voice actors, who are also huge geeks,
sit around and roll dice and have a good time in

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:13,545
the wondrous journey of Dungeons & Dragons. We'll
go ahead and get things started with some

4
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,851
character backstories, have a settle in here, get
the cameras ready, and then we'll start the action

5
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:21,872
as soon as we return. So we'll see you guys here
very soon.

00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:23,462
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

9
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:29,218
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

10
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:35,483
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

11
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:40,677
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

12
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:46,628
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

13
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:52,271
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

14
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,860
life of service and devotion.

15
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,800
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

16
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,935
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

17
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,491
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

18
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:17,893
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

19
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:23,118
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

20
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:30,551
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

21
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:35,167
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could,

22
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,447
bringing him back to life.

23
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:45,579
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends,

24
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:52,490
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

25
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:59,616
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

26
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,503
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

27
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:09,917
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

28
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,344
called the Broken Howl.

29
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:17,514
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her
morningstar in the other, this time,

30
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,861
Pike is ready.

31
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:29,830
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

32
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,300
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

33
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,518
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

34
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,471
(record scratch) Wait.

35
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:49,876
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

36
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:53,295
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

37
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,096
Also ale.

38
00:04:55,096 --> 00:05:01,232
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

39
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:07,672
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

40
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:15,818
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

41
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:21,977
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his

42
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,790
disobedience cost him dearly.

43
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,634
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

44
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:39,700
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

45
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:47,708
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

46
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:53,002
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

47
00:05:53,002 --> 00:06:00,373
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

48
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:05,775
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

49
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,946
Also ale!

50
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:13,321
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

51
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:17,978
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

52
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,277
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

53
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:27,052
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

54
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:32,799
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

55
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:38,273
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

56
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:44,208
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

57
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:49,888
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

58
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:54,653
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

59
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:59,887
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

60
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:07,153
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

61
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:12,772
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

62
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:18,278
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

63
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:24,432
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

64
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:30,393
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

65
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:35,862
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

66
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:42,840
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

67
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,993
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

68
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:50,743
will ever return.

69
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:55,935
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

70
00:07:55,935 --> 00:08:02,393
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

71
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:10,828
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

72
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:18,036
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

73
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:23,870
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

74
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,331
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

75
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:34,954
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

76
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:40,850
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

77
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,039
would stand in their way.

78
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,389
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

79
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:54,640
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

80
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,103
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

81
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:06,464
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

82
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:10,763
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

83
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:17,667
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

84
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:25,267
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

85
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:32,196
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

86
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,667
eye on you.

87
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:39,053
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

88
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:42,841
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

89
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:49,121
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

90
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:54,825
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

91
00:09:54,825 --> 00:10:00,330
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

92
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,400
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

93
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,210
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

94
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,579
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

95
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:20,240
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

96
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,267
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

97
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:31,186
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

98
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:36,902
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

99
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,736
gnome, Pike.

100
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:44,264
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

101
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,408
and makes the females swoon.

102
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:55,671
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

103
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,408
located in the heart of Draconia.

104
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:03,728
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

105
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:08,589
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

106
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,818
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

107
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:19,320
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

108
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,908
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

109
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:29,843
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

110
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:34,706
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

111
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:38,200
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

112
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,145
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

113
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:47,529
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

114
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,642
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

115
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:56,595
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

116
00:11:56,595 --> 00:12:01,142
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

117
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:05,843
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

118
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:11,050
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

119
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,786
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

120
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:22,247
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

121
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:27,945
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

122
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:33,265
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

123
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:41,161
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

124
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:45,580
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

125
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:52,579
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

126
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,698
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

127
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:04,343
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

128
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:09,928
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

129
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:15,483
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

130
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:21,805
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

131
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,696
on the open road.

132
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:28,899
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

133
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:34,974
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

134
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:41,384
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

135
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:51,524
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

136
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:55,311
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

137
00:13:55,311 --> 00:14:02,432
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

138
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:08,842
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

139
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:14,667
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than makes up the

140
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,846
difference.

141
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:21,608
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

142
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:28,935
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

143
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:34,112
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

144
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:39,674
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world

145
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:41,764
were each other.

146
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:47,147
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

147
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:53,888
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

148
00:14:53,888 --> 00:15:00,671
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

149
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:04,588
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

150
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:12,449
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

151
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,772
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

152
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:23,135
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

153
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:30,109
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

154
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:34,904
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

155
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:40,007
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

156
00:15:41,065 --> 00:16:41,956
[dramatic music]

157
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:52,066
MATT: Hello, and welcome back! So before we start,
a couple of quick announcements and things we want

158
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:55,663
to get out to you guys. One, unfortunately Ashley
cannot be here tonight, so we're missing Pike,

159
00:16:55,663 --> 00:17:02,069
sadly. I'll be controlling her as the terrible AI
for the evening. Apologies in advance, guys. She's

160
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,108
only your healer.

161
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:05,116
(all laugh)

162
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:08,162
MATT: Also, as a note, we're still doing the
subscriber giveaways tonight. Our next goal is

163
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:13,362
2700 subscribers. We'll be giving away another
tabletop promo kit that are exclusive only to this

164
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,502
now. You cannot find them anywhere else. So we'll
be giving one of those away to somebody in the

165
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:21,758
chat room, once we hit 2700 subscribers. Which is
awesome! Also, we have our charity we run every

166
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,360
week, 826LA. Marisha, if you want to explain that
a little bit.

167
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,941
MARISHA: Yes! 826LA is a non-profit tutoring
program for kids K through 12th grade. And they're

168
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:36,690
really big on creative writing and storytelling,
and they also have a storefront, the Time Travel

169
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,755
Mart, in--

170
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,154
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Echo Park

171
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:42,670
MARISHA: Echo Park! Thank-you. And Mar Vista.
There's also one in Mar Vista, and there might be

172
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,564
an 826 in your city, I know there's one in
Seattle, and Chicago, and New York. So look them

173
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:52,015
up, they're awesome, and yes. They do great work.
And you can also tutor for them! You should

174
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,001
volunteer.

175
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:54,115
MATT: Which is also great!

176
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,817
ORION: Yeah.

177
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:55,769
MARISHA: Volunteer to be a tutor for 826.

178
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:56,921
MATT: Tutor to teach them to write modules for
D&D.

179
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:57,823
ORION: Think you're smart, huh? Think you're
smart?

180
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,896
LAURA: Do you think you're smart?

181
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,363
MARISHA: Think you're smart? Can you teach a 5th
grader?

182
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:05,238
MATT: Exactly. And also, if you donate to 826LA at
the end of the show today we'll read off some of

183
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:08,992
the messages you guys wrote as part of donations,
at the end of the show, so we'll give you personal

184
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:15,876
thanks for that at the end of... of today. So
that's be cool. Also, I'm wearing a shirt. You

185
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:19,407
notice it's grey-ish colored, this is our second
run of the first-- And I say first, because

186
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:22,774
there's hopefully more to come soon-- Critical
Role shirt. You guys keep asking for it, we

187
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:26,528
finally set up a Teespring. It'll only be up for
the next two weeks, and we're trying to hit

188
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:31,402
certain goals, so that if we manage to hit a
thousand tees sold, we're going to go ahead and do

189
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,255
another full cast Q&A. If we can all find any that
we're available for.

190
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,806
LAURA: Oh, awesome!

191
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:41,374
MATT: But yeah, so these shirts are available.
They're on Teespring.com/Critical-Role. We've

192
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,013
already had a few trolls go in there and create
their own T-shirts, and say that they're official

193
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,755
when they're not, so don't buy those.

194
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,634
MARISHA: Not ours. It's those! That's what it
looks like.

195
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,956
MATT: So this grey with full cast setup there.

196
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,376
ORION: They didn't even ask us.

197
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:54,195
MARISHA: So the first ones we did in navy. These
are done in grey.

198
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,194
LIAM: Second edition.

199
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:59,726
MARISHA: And then we'll probably retire this
design after this.

200
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:03,664
MATT: After this. This'll be your one chance to
get this design, and we have more stuff coming

201
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:09,547
down the road hopefully. But yeah! So check it out
Teespring.com/Critical-Role. If you guys want one,

202
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:13,520
go grab one. Also, quick little things you want to
promote that we've been working on recently.

203
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,960
Marisha and Taliesin? You said you wanted to...

204
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,576
TALIESIN: Yeah! We we just did some voices for the
new Marvel: Age of Ultron pinball game.

205
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,685
MARISHA: Yes!

206
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,927
TALIESIN: I did the voice of Ultron, so you can
hear me be evil!

207
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:32,931
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes, and I voice Black Widow.
And doing a little... little ScarJo...

208
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:33,993
up in there.

209
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:36,922
ORION: Yeah. No! Doing a little Marisha Ray up in
there.

210
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:40,178
MATT: Speaking of Black Widow...

211
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,518
MARISHA: And speaking-- speaking of Black Widow!

212
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,317
LAURA: Oh, yeah! So now two Black Widows in the
house.

213
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,754
MARISHA: (makes high-five sound effect) Black
Widow!

214
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:46,904
LAURA: Yeah, cause we all do Avengers Assemble. On
Disney XD.

215
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,541
TRAVIS: Every Sunday morning.

216
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,508
LAURA: What what what!

217
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:50,539
MARISHA: Avengers assemble!

218
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,817
LAURA: Thor, Black Widow, Red Skull. You bastard.

219
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,011
TRAVIS: Don't say anything!

220
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,486
SAM: He also plays Black Widow.

221
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:03,231
MATT: It's a whole new weird arc.

222
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,796
MARISHA: Black Widows, woo!

223
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,541
LAURA: And then the episode of TableTop that I did
just dropped today, as well.

224
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,285
MATT: That's awesome.

225
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:10,153
ORION: Nice!

226
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,464
MATT: Go check that out. Watch Laura go and
destroy a bunch of folks on another game.

227
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:15,604
LAURA: Yeah. A very scary horror RPG.

228
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,107
MATT: Ooh, that sounds awesome.

229
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:18,829
ORION: Is there anything else?

230
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:20,153
MATT: I have something, but you're next.

231
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:25,902
ORION: And my comedy troupe, i8athumbtack on
YouTube, we just put out a video called

232
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:30,577
"Helping the Homeless!" You should check it out. 
There's this douchebag called fouseyTUBE

233
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:34,841
that we were parodying, and we think it's funny.

234
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:35,951
MATT: Awesome.

235
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,539
ORION: But yeah, that just came out a couple days
ago.

236
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:42,114
LIAM: And I should have done this a couple of
weeks ago, but Transformers: Robots in Disguise is

237
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:48,288
now on the telly, and I play a Decepticon named
Underbite, who eats everything. It's a really well

238
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,671
done show, and Decepticons are better than
Autobots, and check it out.

239
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,995
LAURA: You're villains on everything, are you?

240
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:56,243
LIAM: Hell yeah.

241
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,485
TRAVIS: Do you have a lisp in that show?

242
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,279
MATT: He gives good villain.

243
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,184
LIAM: Not on this show. What?

244
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:00,105
TRAVIS: What?

245
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,658
MATT: Yeah.There you go. Also I have the pleasure
today to announce that I am the voice of Tim

246
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,229
Drake, Robin, in Arkham Knight.

247
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,751
TRAVIS: Yeah!

248
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:06,860
MATT: So I'm excited about that.

249
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,774
MARISHA: Tim Drake!

250
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:08,856
LIAM: That game looks boring.

251
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:12,747
MATT: I know, pfft! Who's going to touch it?
Yeah... that was a huge honor, so I'm really

252
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:16,148
excited about that. So if anyone has anything
else? Those are our announcements for this

253
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:20,579
evening. We can hop on in. Also, those that the
t-shirts, I think it just got set up in the chat

254
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,892
room that if you scroll all the way to the bottom
there will be a button for you to find the

255
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:29,356
t-shirts, so even easier way of getting to them.
Check it out. Anyway! So, into the game. Let me go

256
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,597
ahead and get the music going because I think
that's a required aspect of this as far as I'm

257
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:33,561
concerned.

258
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,200
LIAM: I'm always nervous in the first five
minutes.

259
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,738
TALIESIN: You remember how to play?

260
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,832
LIAM: I got dice.

261
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,898
SAM: Here we go.

262
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:44,610
MATT: So. As a quick overview as to where we were,
the party essentially was given a quest from the

263
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:52,582
capital city of Emon to find the missing folk hero
Lady Kima of Vord, a halfling paladin, very well

264
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:57,259
known, who had gone missing while on a pilgrimage
vision quest over the past year. She had been

265
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:01,304
missing for a number of weeks, nearly months at
this point, and you were sent to the dwarven city

266
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,853
of Kraghammer to find and bring her back safely.

267
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:08,630
After going to the city, you discover that she had
delved into the mines, seeking some sort of

268
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:15,018
extremely dark evil that was seated somewhere deep
beneath Kraghammer proper. In searching for her,

269
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:20,945
you managed to find your way through the mines
into the entrance passage into the Underdark. The

270
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:25,081
Underdark which is a very scary place. You've
encountered a number of subterranean beasts and

271
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:28,887
creatures, some of which are unnaturally mutated
or altered by some sort of magic

272
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:30,618
you cannot place.

273
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:34,795
Upon going through these caverns, a few battles
with duergar, the ashen-skinned evil subterranean

274
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:39,207
dwarves-- further subterranean dwarves, I guess
you'd say, and encountered your first mind

275
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:43,845
flayers, illithids, which seem to have allied,
strangely, with the duergar. Normally enemies by

276
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:48,869
nature, they're working together under what you
discovered in sense is a common enemy referred to

277
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:55,258
as K'Varn. Nothing really is known of K'Varn,
other than it has a great power and has united

278
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:59,481
these two forces for some nefarious purpose.
Apparently these abominations, and these strange

279
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:03,677
mutations you've encountered, these experiments,
also seem to have been created by K'Varn, though

280
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:06,791
no one knows quite why or how.

281
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:14,225
As you traversed down, you managed to... befriend
a arcanist mind flayer that was cast out from the

282
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:20,564
colony, named Clarota, who has aided you under the
intent that you would help him free his people of

283
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:25,131
the slavery of K'Varn and release the mind flayers
to their own normal state of mind.

284
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:30,071
And you've made your way to the duergar fortress,
Emberhold, found and released Lady Kima, who

285
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:36,693
underwent many, many weeks of torturous
experiences to come through still firm of mind and

286
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:43,170
ready to kick some ass. Through a very painful
battle in the Emberhold, you managed to pull your

287
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:47,115
party out, only a few of them turned to stone, and
with a foot burned off.

288
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,961
(all laugh)

289
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:56,814
MATT: And Grog being dominated and Grog-napped by
the surviving queen, duergar Queen Ulara.

290
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:59,217
TRAVIS: What? Everybody needs a nap.

291
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:01,466
MARISHA: We're going to have to get one of those
child leashes for you.

292
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,873
LAURA: Maybe we can get a chip implanted in him so
we can track him all the time.

293
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:06,245
MARISHA: Oh yeah, like a dog chip?

294
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,602
MATT: (laughs) So get on enchanting that,
Tiberius.

295
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:08,558
TRAVIS: I like chips.

296
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,090
LAURA: Yeah. Or like one of those tiles you put on
your keys.

297
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,079
MARISHA: Yes. That's actually not a bad idea. Can
we do that?

298
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,451
TALIESIN: There's an app for that.

299
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,419
SAM: A Grog-jack?

300
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,584
TRAVIS: Percy, you can make that.

301
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,486
MATT: Grog-jack? Whenever he gets taken, it gives
a little beeper in your pocket.

302
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:19,374
SAM: Yeah.

303
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:25,095
MATT: So, the party then, in trying to locate
Grog's position, found their way delving past the

304
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:32,970
lava fall-based element of the obsidian rock
duergar Underdark. Deeper into discovering this...

305
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:39,861
cursed... pit of undeath, bone shards, and glass.
Upon traversing it they encountered one of these

306
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:45,630
abominations that you've seen traces of left
before, this weird, half... partial elven, partial

307
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,641
tentacle monstrosity, that slashed through your
party, nearly killed Trinket,

308
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,833
but was defeated by you.

309
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:58,281
You managed to make your way across this bone
field and discover what appears to be a camp,

310
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:04,698
across a number of pillars in the distance. Vax
went ahead and stealthed up, looked over and saw

311
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:11,929
that there was a camp of duergar, and apparently
the surviving Queen Ulara giving them orders. Next

312
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:17,423
to Grog, who is currently bolted by iron bands to
some sort of a cart that they've been dragging him

313
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:23,015
through this tunnel passage with. And that is where
we have left off. So.

314
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:24,854
TALIESIN: I think I've got a plan.

315
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,571
SAM: Oh. Because I did, too.

316
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:27,599
TALIESIN: You have a plan?

317
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,653
SAM: No, I want to hear yours. Let's do them both
without telling, and just see what happens.

318
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:35,094
TALIESIN: I'll Roshambo you for it.

319
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:37,486
ORION: I actually-- I actually like this idea,
Scanlan.

320
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:43,191
TALIESIN: Keyleth can meld through rock. So, if we
can get the attention of everyone who's guarding

321
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:48,492
Grog, she could slip through while we're drawing
them out, and get through and let him go in the

322
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:49,804
midst of the fight.

323
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:51,024
SAM: That works with my plan.

324
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,063
TALIESIN: That works with your plan?

325
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:56,325
SAM: My plan was to-- was to go in there and
distract them while you did something!

326
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:57,965
(all laugh)

327
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,336
LAURA: Perfect plan!

328
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:01,066
TALIESIN: I like that plan.

329
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:05,204
SAM: I hadn't completed the thought because the
something hadn't been worked out.

330
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:06,695
TALIESIN: You were 80% there.

331
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:10,469
LIAM: Actually, let me tell you all that Grog is
up here, you didn't know.

332
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,007
TALIESIN: I assumed you'd come back by now.

333
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:13,832
LIAM: No, I'm still up there.

334
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:16,197
SAM: That raises the stakes!

335
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:17,730
(all laugh)

336
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,380
LIAM: Last week I said, "Come up now." And that's
when he called it.

337
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,895
ORION: And I had already taken off. So I'm already
headed there.

338
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:24,888
MATT: All right.

339
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:26,217
TALIESIN: Well, he's at least said, "Come up
now."

340
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,624
MARISHA: So we're... we're there.

341
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:28,723
MATT: So Tiberius, roll a stealth check.

342
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:32,893
LAURA: Great... Great, Tiberius, go for it.

343
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,100
TALIESIN: Damn it.

344
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,875
LIAM: "Hold on, let me show you my collection of
tin cans tied to my tail."

345
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:40,058
ORION: Actually, you know what? No, I'm fine, I'll
just roll.

346
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,605
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll the shit out of that.

347
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:43,541
ORION: 16.

348
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:50,006
MATT: 16? Okay. So, as Tiberius coasts up along
the back portion of Vax's arrival point...

349
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:55,817
LIAM: (whispering) Where is everybody?

350
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:57,307
LAURA: (whispering) We're on our way.

351
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:59,352
ORION: (whispering) I don't know. I heard you--

352
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:04,033
MATT: You notice one of the duergar looks over his
shoulder in your direction.

353
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,607
SAM: And plan over.

354
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,906
MATT: And begins to make a few steps in that
direction.

355
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:10,679
MARISHA: Wait. Who? You?

356
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,874
SAM: Yeah, he went in anyway.

357
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:13,210
LAURA: Yeah, and he's not stealthed enough.

358
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,273
LIAM: All right, I grab Tiberius by the snout and
pull him back, around the edge of that rock. I'm

359
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:22,702
just doing it. Pulling my dagger out.

360
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:28,234
MATT: All right. So the duergar continues to move
forward towards the edge of the rock...

361
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:30,071
LIAM: Oh, come up here please...

362
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:31,406
LAURA: "Okay!" We stealth. Can I head that way?

363
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:34,656
LIAM: And I'm throwing a knife into the dwarf's
neck.

364
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,014
SAM: Oh, Jesus! That's not very stealthy at all!

365
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:38,363
LIAM: Well, it's coming over!

366
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,221
MATT: All right, so the rest of you guys go ahead
and roll stealth.

367
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:42,015
LIAM: He's not waiting!

368
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:45,333
SAM: We've been doing this for 30 seconds. We're
already in a fight! I was going to distract them!

369
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,623
LIAM: I'm not going to stand here and wait for the
duergar to walk around the corner.

370
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:48,870
ORION: I was going to distract them, too.

371
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,534
MATT: And... you got one of them.

372
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:52,366
TRAVIS: It's a classic movie moment.

373
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:56,599
SAM: I'm going in. I'm walking into the camp.

374
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,957
MARISHA: What? Wait, okay, wait. Are we abandoning
the plan?

375
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:02,641
TALIESIN: No, we're just going for it right now.

376
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,447
MARISHA: All right!

377
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:04,772
LIAM: Oh my god!

378
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:06,938
MATT: All right, so the rest of you...

379
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,533
LAURA: I rolled a nine, so it doesn't even
matter.

380
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,646
MATT: It doesn't matter at this point.

381
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,688
TALIESIN: I rolled a ten, yeah.

382
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,747
MATT: Okay, so the rest of you begin trudging in,
down this tunnel, towards the edge.

383
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:15,215
TALIESIN: Goddamn.

384
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:19,853
MATT: Clarota and Kima are... (laughs) holding up
the back rear end.

385
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:23,502
LIAM: You know, if you wait five minutes, I can at
least take one out.

386
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:28,145
MATT: As Scanlan approaches, the duergar
immediately turns around.

387
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,143
MARISHA: Hi, duergar!

388
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:34,437
LIAM: Right up behind him-- (surprise sound
effect) Cut his neck, cut the throat.

389
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:35,807
MARISHA: I turn into an earth elemental.

390
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:42,234
MATT: All right,simultaneously, as you approach,
the duergar looks behind, gives you a glance, and

391
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:47,580
you can see his eyes, normally pupil-less eyes of
the ashy-skinned duergar are now glowing with an

392
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,776
odd dull green color that you haven't seen in
duergar previously, and he starts rushing towards

393
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:56,352
you. He's going to make a simultaneous round
rushing up to you for an attack while you release

394
00:28:56,352 --> 00:29:00,002
your two attacks against him and you release your
dagger.

395
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,343
MARISHA: Go, twinsies!

396
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:03,473
TRAVIS: Who hits Scanlan?

397
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,208
MATT: This calls for a music change.

398
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,370
SAM: (sighs) Well, the best laid plans....

399
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,236
LAURA: My first one was an ultimate fail.

400
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:18,915
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, the first
duergar swings at you with his war hammer. To you

401
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:22,552
Scanlan, that comes down with a 12.

402
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,918
SAM: 12 versus armor class?

403
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:26,115
MATT: Versus your armor class, yeah.

404
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:27,165
SAM: I'm okay!

405
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:32,419
MATT: You pull back and the giant war hammer
swings past you and you duck out of the way.

406
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,673
Thankfully, though the duergar are relatively
small, you're much smaller, and as a gnome you

407
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:41,239
slip right out of the path of the actual hammer
blow. Your first arrow misses,

408
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,262
second one you said hits?

409
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:43,113
LAURA: 25.

410
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:46,022
MATT: 25 definitively hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

411
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:51,508
LAURA: Ugh, why? Why? Oh, I'm cursed today! Eight.

412
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,000
MATT: Eight damage.

413
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,238
LAURA: Eight damage.

414
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:59,908
MATT: All right, so, after he swings past Scanlan,
who ducks out of the way, one arrow (whizzing

415
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:03,057
sound effect) just cruises over his head and you
hear it scattering and clattering against the

416
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:06,643
rocks in the distance. He looks over in your
direction as the second one just grazes his

417
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:10,617
shoulder. You can see a little bit of blood begin
to spill, but it doesn't even turn his head

418
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:15,376
towards the wound, he's still just glaring at you
angrily while you throw your dagger from behind.

419
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:17,947
Him not even aware of your presence, currently.

420
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,824
LIAM: 20. Natural 20!

421
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:23,625
TALIESIN: First of the night.

422
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:29,212
LIAM: There is a magnet inside this die. I should
be-- Just full disclosure. Okay, so natural 20.

423
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,667
MATT: Yeah. We're buying you new dice next week.

424
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,379
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Will you buy me new dice as
well? Thank you.

425
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:40,366
MATT: So! As you pull Tiberius back, clutching the
front of his snout, keeping him quiet, you pull a

426
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:45,213
dagger out, toss it in the air, catch it and fling
it at full speed, striking true. Go ahead and roll

427
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:48,576
damage. With sneak attack bonus. Also multiplied
because of the crit.

428
00:30:48,576 --> 00:31:04,035
LIAM: Yes. He's gone, he's gone. Okay, ...
(mumbles numbers) 47.

429
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:10,294
MATT: All right. So. As he turns and the arrow
strikes off his shoulder and he glares at you,

430
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:14,907
Vex. He pulls back his hammer again looking down
at Scanlan, coming down for a blow to basically

431
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:19,399
bash his skull in, but he stops suddenly, as you
see this blade protrude from the front of his

432
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:27,947
skull. His glowing eyes fade back to a dull, pale
whitish color, and his body slumps onto the ground

433
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:33,340
as your dagger magically returns to your hand from
below. Duergar down.

434
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,365
LAURA: I nod to you. Good job.

435
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:37,568
SAM: I step forward and say-- is her name Ulara?

436
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:39,396
MATT: Ulara. Queen Ulara.

437
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:43,445
SAM: Queen Ulara. Show yourself! Step out and talk
to us. Everyone hold.

438
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,466
MATT: And the rest of you, are you all staying
where you are? Are you coming

439
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,743
forward with Scanlan?

440
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:49,679
MARISHA: Oh, you're talking? We're doing a talking
thing?

441
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,227
LAURA: Let's step up behind him. I want to step up
and make him look more imposing with me and

442
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:54,268
Trinket behind him.

443
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:58,808
MARISHA: I am-- I am going-- Hang on, wait, what
are you do-- what?

444
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:01,983
LAURA: I want to step up behind Scanlan with a
bear behind him, and make him look more imposing.

445
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:13,425
MARISHA: I'm going to... slink back into the
shadows and turn into an earth elemental, and sink

446
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:14,856
into the ground.

447
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,108
MATT: Okay.

448
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,576
MARISHA: And hopefully they don't see that
happen.

449
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,190
MATT: Keyleth... is no longer Keyleth.

450
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,299
LAURA: (laughs) Whoa, you're huge!

451
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,142
MATT: And then-- (swoosh sound effects) fades
underneath the earth somewhere. Just slips into

452
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:28,711
it, almost like sand through an hourglass, you
just vanish beneath the surface of the rock.

453
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,851
TRAVIS: Great way to leave a party.

454
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:35,852
MATT: Kima steps forward, making a point to step
angrily onto the corpse of the duergar. You hear

455
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:40,230
the crunching of bone and metal as she steps over
his corpse. Percy, you're approaching as well?

456
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,837
TALIESIN: I'm... staying a little bit back.

457
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:42,950
MATT: Okay, so about there?

458
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,989
TALIESIN: Yeah, about there.

459
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:48,766
MATT: All right. Clarota's going to move off to
the side... here, and Pike is going to come and

460
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,071
get the center point she feels the most applicable
to heal.

461
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,054
LIAM: DM?

462
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:52,819
MATT: Yes?

463
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:53,992
LIAM: Where on the map is the queen right now?

464
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:54,855
MATT: You don't see right now.

465
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:55,743
LIAM: Don't see her.

466
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:56,976
SAM: She's in the tent. She's in the tent, right?

467
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,607
MATT: Grog, which is right over here.

468
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:06,723
ORION: I see what's going on and I rub my ring and
I go invisible.

469
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:08,297
MATT: Okay.

470
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,623
ORION: Greater Invisibility.

471
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:16,680
MATT: All right, so. Tiberius also vanishes from
view. You glance over your shoulder, Vax, and

472
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,525
notice that Tiberius is just gone. Just (whoosh)
vanished. All right. So. As you shouted this out,

473
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:29,553
the secondary duergar now turns and... First off,
make a persuasion check. Well, no, in this case

474
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:31,730
intimidation, I think, is what this is going to
be.

475
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,067
SAM: Do I roll again?

476
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:38,513
MATT: I'll say okay, because it is a different
skill, so yeah.

477
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:42,319
ORION: Matt, I'd like to move to the other side.

478
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,801
MATT: You'll get about there with this round.

479
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:47,097
SAM: 22.

480
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:48,120
MATT: 22?

481
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,562
LIAM: Fucking love this game.

482
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:55,233
MATT: All right. As you shout this, the duergar
grabs this warpick from his side, looks at you

483
00:33:55,233 --> 00:34:00,625
angrily, and begins to step forward, as a giant
grizzly bear and the rest of the party filters up

484
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:07,799
behind you in full flying V formation. He puts his
pick to his side and yells off his shoulder, "My

485
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:11,341
"Queen. We've got company!"

486
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:16,651
As he does, the flaps of the far end of the tent,
here, open up. There's a dwarf there, not a

487
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,763
duergar, but a dwarf that is standing there to the
side, that steps out of the way, and Queen Ulara

488
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:29,603
steps out, as well. You see her angrily look off
to the side. "(sighs angrily) Well, then. It

489
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:32,299
"appears that we have some business to discuss."

490
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:37,968
And she begins to step past the front of the fire
way. Stopping right next to the fire pit, keeping

491
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:43,100
a good 15-foot distance, with her arms crossed.
The dwarf comes and flanks her on this side, and

492
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,305
you now see-- while I cannot seem to find the
figure for the life of me right now to represent

493
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:56,709
it. We'll use this, for the time being. There is
an elf also flanking her. Normal looking elf,

494
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:01,370
dressed in what looks like a fine chainmail
attire. Longsword at the side. So there's an elf

495
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,534
and a dwarf, both flanking.

496
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,203
LIAM: And they're clearly with her.

497
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,229
MATT: They are at her side, like they're ready to
defend her.

498
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,930
LIAM: They could be charmed.

499
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:18,132
SAM: Queen Ulara, if I may have a word. Let us
spare each other lots of bloodshed and just have a

500
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:22,434
chat before we fight. Is that all right?

501
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:29,649
MATT: "Talk, small annoying creature, and perhaps
it'll delay the inevitable."

502
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:33,164
SAM: My friends and I have come--

503
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,127
LAURA: Hello!

504
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:41,847
SAM: Hi, yes... We've come from the above world.
The normal world, let's say, to your fine kingdom

505
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:49,172
down here below. And we were on a mission. We're a
bit of-- I don't want to brag, but we're a bit of

506
00:35:49,172 --> 00:35:56,958
an elite task force, sent in by kingdoms and kings
that you probably haven't heard of way down below,

507
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,750
but anyway. I'll spare you.

508
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,141
MATT: Hold that thought just for a second. Percy,
go ahead and roll a perception check.

509
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:08,637
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.... When it's out of the blue
like that it's always bad.

510
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,777
TALIESIN: Ten.

511
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:12,004
MATT: Okay. Continue.

512
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:17,328
LIAM: Wait. DM. Vax is creeping along the back of
that tent and curving around.

513
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:18,298
MATT: All right.

514
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:19,276
LIAM: Thank you.

515
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:24,709
ORION: I'm going to do the earring and go to
Scanlan and be like, "Keep it simple, will you? I

516
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,632
"mean, really, calm down."

517
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:28,788
SAM: (laughs) Copy that.

518
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:30,255
TRAVIS: Yeah, how could you?

519
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:37,771
SAM: My lady, we have come on a mission. To save
someone that you were holding captive. We have

520
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:45,243
completed our mission, and in the melee, in that
hovel you called a palace back there, we lost one

521
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:51,391
of our own, and we would like him back. Now, I'll
make it very simple because my fellows are begging

522
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:57,672
me to keep things simple. It's a simple binary
choice. You can all die right now, or you can turn

523
00:36:57,672 --> 00:37:04,121
over our friend and we will probably, probably
leave you in peace. I would promise, but I don't

524
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,384
make promises to dogs.

525
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:09,461
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Ooh! Oh snap!

526
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:14,095
MARISHA: Oh shit! I move in behind where the
pillar is, but in the ground.

527
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:15,633
MATT: Behind where this pillar is, in the ground?

528
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,198
MARISHA: No, I'm-- yeah, I'm there-ish.

529
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:24,458
MATT: All right. So, at that response, and you're
noticing now as you're getting a better glance at

530
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:31,352
the queen, too, the normally white, pale duergar
eyes have a strange green glow-ish hue to them. As

531
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,683
do the two individuals to the right and left of
her. And she just looks you square in the face.

532
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:46,778
"You took my king from me. Came and slayed him in
his own throne room. You took something I love, I

533
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:53,755
"take something you love. He's mine now. And I'm
bringing him to his greater destiny."

534
00:37:53,755 --> 00:38:00,973
At which point, a loud, horrendous streaking sound
pierces the ears of everyone in this vicinity. As

535
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:07,780
appearing out of a ripple of energy, a
once-invisible mind flayer goes cascading out a

536
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:15,722
mind blast in a cone that just tears through the
entire group here. Scanlan, Vex, Pike, as well.

537
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:25,934
Trinket, Percy, go ahead and roll an intelligence
saving throw.

538
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:27,772
TRAVIS: I'll die once I finally come back.

539
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,281
SAM: Saving throw?

540
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,062
MATT: Yes.

541
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,099
SAM: What is that?

542
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,812
MATT: Roll your saving throw for intelligence.

543
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:33,669
SAM: Okay.

544
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,965
LIAM: Small square near the top upper left hand.

545
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,285
TRAVIS: At least I don't have to roll for
intelligence.

546
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:40,469
SAM: 21.

547
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:42,560
MATT: All right. Percy.

548
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,780
LAURA: Do I roll for Trinket, too?

549
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,559
TALIESIN: 16.

550
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,121
MATT: Yes, you do. Okay. Vex.

551
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:50,679
LAURA: 14.

552
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,386
MATT: Okay. And?

553
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:54,763
LAURA: And Trinket is eight.

554
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:58,844
MATT: So, you double over, clutching your skull,
as the pain is too much to bear, and you find

555
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:02,132
yourself unable to actually draw commands to your
muscles for them to function.

556
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,650
You are currently stunned.

557
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,565
LAURA: Great.

558
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:05,744
MATT: Roll for Trinket.

559
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,018
LAURA: Oh, he rolled an eight.

560
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:13,553
MATT: Trinket falls to the ground with this
horrible (bear groan) sound, digging his nose into

561
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:17,390
the actual dirt to try and find a way to escape
this piercing mental agony,

562
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,759
this psychic damage...

563
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,461
LAURA: It's pretty shitty, you guys. It sucks.

564
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:22,753
MATT: Both of you guys take 22 points of psychic
damage, by the way.

565
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,191
LAURA: Oh, good. Trinket's about to die again.

566
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,454
MARISHA: Who's all stunned?

567
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:27,779
TALIESIN: Laura, twice.

568
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,471
ORION: Bear and Vex.

569
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,779
MATT: Pike also.

570
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,782
TALIESIN: And Pike.

571
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:35,845
LIAM: DM, I'm throwing a dagger at the queen.

572
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:40,369
MATT: Okay. Now we roll initiative, folks, because
stuff has begun.

573
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:43,636
ORION: (fumbling) Can I do something right before
that?

574
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:48,974
MATT: No, essentially this triggers the combat
now. This was an immediate occurrence. Now we're

575
00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:50,510
going into initiative order.

576
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,556
ORION: Okay.

577
00:39:51,556 --> 00:40:00,407
LIAM: Now, by my saying that, do I get into the
initiative order, or does my action come out, my

578
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:01,965
decision come out before?

579
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,070
MATT: I would say for the two that didn't act this
turn, you guys can have advantage on the

580
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,975
initiative roll because you guys have been holding
your actions. So Tiberius, you can also have

581
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:12,987
advantage on your initiative roll, since you guys
were holding off.

582
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:13,668
LIAM: 21.

583
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:14,510
MATT: 21?

584
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,268
MARISHA: Nice, that's better!

585
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:16,211
ORION: That's way better than a two.

586
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,914
LAURA: I don't roll anything because I'm stunned?

587
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:23,060
MATT: You are stunned currently. You still roll
initiative so we have the order that you go in.

588
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,798
ORION: 21.

589
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,444
TALIESIN: 22.

590
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:28,565
MATT: All right.

591
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:30,091
MARISHA: Oh are we doing this?

592
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:31,965
MATT: We are.

593
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,336
LIAM: It's on like Tron.

594
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:37,432
LAURA: I've got a 13.

595
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:40,114
MATT: Guys, hang on. So 20 to 15?

596
00:40:40,114 --> 00:40:42,485
TALIESIN: 22.

597
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,533
SAM: 18.

598
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:46,727
MATT: 18, all right, wow. We got some good
initiative rolls, guys, good job!

599
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,944
MARISHA: 16 here.

600
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:52,286
MATT: Okay. 15 to ten?

601
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:56,736
LAURA: Oh, me. 13.

602
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:58,387
MATT: There we go.

603
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:02,056
LIAM: You play stunned well.

604
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:06,495
LAURA: I'm not a victim. I'm going to kick butt as
soon as I wake up.

605
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:20,755
MATT: Oh, yeah. Kima also fell stunned to that,
unfortunately. All right, that brings us to.... I

606
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:24,104
think that's everyone's initiative, right?

607
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:25,062
LIAM: 21 over here.

608
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:29,603
MATT: Yeah, yeah everyone's in. All right, cool.
So, top of the round. Percy, you're up first.

609
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:35,320
TALIESIN: We need earth elemental stats if you
know where they are, by the way.

610
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,096
MATT: Oh, did you not print them out? Monster
Manual.

611
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,520
TALIESIN: Monster Manual.

612
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,159
MATT: Here we go. (funny accent) See, this comes
in handy more often than you'd think.

613
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:51,430
TALIESIN: Yeah. But while we're looking that up,
I'm basically going to pull my gun, I'm going to

614
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,799
fire four times into the face of that awful, awful
screaming bastard.

615
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:59,502
MATT: Of the, the mind flayer over here?

616
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:00,652
TALIESIN: Yeah, the mind flayer.

617
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:05,498
MATT: Okay, so you whip around, he's there in your
face, go ahead and make-- You're using your action

618
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:07,473
surge to fire two additional times, you said?

619
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:08,277
TALIESIN: Yeah.

620
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:10,657
MATT: Okay, wow, four rounds. Go for an attack.

621
00:42:10,657 --> 00:42:14,842
TALIESIN: First attack with Pepperbox is 13?

622
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:19,841
MATT: 13? Unfortunately misses. Form shifts
(whooshing sounds), and you can feel the psychic

623
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:23,522
energy of its oppressive mental force, causing
your hand to miss its aim with

624
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:25,642
each pull of the trigger.

625
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:28,926
TALIESIN: All right fire shot for 19.

626
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:30,138
MATT: 19 does hit.

627
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:32,209
TALIESIN: That's my fire shot... so that's...

628
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:37,301
TRAVIS: Put it on him, Percy, let's go.

629
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:41,162
TALIESIN: Oh my god, this sucks! Eight points of
damage. What is this about?

630
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,258
MATT: Okay. Third attack?

631
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:43,434
TALIESIN: Third attack.

632
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:47,940
MATT: Spin the barrel again on the Pepperbox
(gunshot).

633
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,687
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

634
00:42:49,687 --> 00:42:51,149
TRAVIS: Get on it!

635
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,871
LAURA: Murder him!

636
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:58,527
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of damage.

637
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:01,143
MARISHA: Is it doubled?

638
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,789
MATT: All righty. That's doubled with the
critical?

639
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,905
TALIESIN: That's 2d10. I double the dice, right?

640
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:05,673
MATT: Yeah.

641
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:06,386
TALIESIN: Yeah.

642
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:08,154
MATT: Or roll and double the dice number, but
that's fine. Okay.

643
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:15,241
TALIESIN: So that's that. And now I'm going to
take a sharpshooter bonus, so... Oh, that sucks.

644
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:16,863
That's 11, that doesn't hit.

645
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,456
MATT: Unfortunately. So the first one hits,
the second one actually clips part of its chest

646
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:24,266
and you can see, as it tries to use its psychic
abilities to resist the bullet, it still pierces

647
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:27,701
its chest in the side. Missing everything vital,
still causing it to (makes painful hissing sound),

648
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:29,197
sucks in the air for a moment.

649
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:32,827
TALIESIN: That was a terrible roll. I'm going to
use some movement to dodge left to get out of the

650
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:33,962
way of that guy.

651
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:35,389
MATT: Okay. So going this way?

652
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:37,398
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go... Yeah, about
there.

653
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:42,511
MATT: Okay, cool. Probably should get out the
laser pointers.

654
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:43,651
TRAVIS: I'll bring him one.

655
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:46,150
SAM: Hey, is Grog stone?

656
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,619
LIAM: Grog's tied. Grog is held by iron bands.
He's down.

657
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,209
TRAVIS: Grog's been hitting the peace pipe.

658
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:52,493
SAM: He's unconscious.

659
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,003
MATT: You guys don't know; you haven't seen him
yet.

660
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:59,162
LIAM: I saw him, you described it to me last week.
He's in iron bands held on a cart.

661
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:00,357
LAURA: But he's awake, right?

662
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:01,972
MATT: Yeah, on a cart. You haven't checked.

663
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,112
MARISHA: Iron bands?

664
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:04,314
LIAM: Yeah, he's tied down.

665
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,235
MARISHA: He's on the whole cart though, right?

666
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:07,942
MATT: Tiberius. You're up next.

667
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:15,687
ORION: Great. I peek over the little thing, and I
go, "Ooh!" and I throw a fireball from my ring.

668
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:19,226
MATT: (laughs) Okay, where are you throwing it?

669
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,043
ORION: Oh, right in the juicy spot of those three.

670
00:44:21,043 --> 00:44:21,960
MATT: Right here?

671
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,676
ORION: Yeah.

672
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:28,106
MATT: Okay. So. As they're all sitting there,
looking ready to pounce for this series of battle,

673
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:32,166
all of a sudden there's a slight streak of reddish
energy in the distance as you all are watching. It

674
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:36,663
looks almost like the fire pit behind them just
explodes in this giant fiery ball of red, angry

675
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:40,811
magical fury. So go ahead and roll your 8d6
damage.

676
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:48,433
ORION: (mumbling numbers) I'm missing d6s.

677
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:50,518
TALIESIN: There's two more.

678
00:44:50,518 --> 00:45:04,776
ORION: Wonderful. (mumbles) That's... 31 damage.

679
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:11,253
MATT: 31 points of damage, okay. Queen Ulara you
notice, as the duergar are generally considered--

680
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:15,566
as this blasts in this area as well-- both her and
the duergar make their saving throw; they have

681
00:45:15,566 --> 00:45:17,195
magic resistance innately against it.

682
00:45:17,195 --> 00:45:20,448
TRAVIS: Against magic?

683
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:29,422
MATT: Yeah, they're hardy creatures, man. However!
The elf on this side ends up being thrown to the

684
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:34,819
side and its entire body gets thrown about 20-30
feet across from the force of the explosion,

685
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:38,874
landing on the ground lifeless, next to you.
(skidding noise) On the ground, a burnt cinder.

686
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:43,488
The dwarf takes the brunt of it as well. Appears
to still be alive, but looks very horribly burned

687
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:47,014
and is looking at its hands now like (pained
grunting sound). Barely standing.

688
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:52,185
ORION: And then I spend two sorcerer points to
(crackling sound effect) form an ice knife.

689
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:56,341
MATT: Before we get to that point, Grog, you also
take that damage.

690
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:58,718
TRAVIS: Oh. How many points?

691
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:00,583
LIAM: He's a freaking sponge. He'll be fine.

692
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,668
ORION: Why?

693
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:07,098
MATT: Because you said you threw it in the fire,
there? Grog's right there. On a cart.

694
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,239
ORION: I said the juicy spot of those three! I
knew Grog was there. Of course

695
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,954
I wouldn't throw it there.

696
00:46:11,954 --> 00:46:13,032
TRAVIS: I can take it.

697
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:13,972
ORION: Okay, fine.

698
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,412
(all laugh)

699
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:16,982
MATT: I pointed here.

700
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,873
ORION: Yeah, but... I thought-- I don't know.

701
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:21,929
MATT: Be specific next time! But yeah, that's
okay. He can take it.

702
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:24,012
MARISHA: We're down all of our laser pointers.

703
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:28,188
ORION: And I throw that, right in the back of
Queeny's head.

704
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:33,220
MATT: Okay. All right, go for it. So as you
coalesce this arcane energy into this blue, cold,

705
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:41,455
freezing plume of... moisture in your hand, it
forms into this giant jagged blade of ice, and you

706
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:46,970
chuck it in a straight line. Go ahead and roll a
d20 plus your spell attack modifier.

707
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,439
MARISHA: Get it. Get some.

708
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:51,588
ORION: 19.

709
00:46:51,588 --> 00:46:54,086
MATT: 19 does hit, even with her mage armor.

710
00:46:54,086 --> 00:47:04,642
ORION: Sweet. And then that's 1d10. So that's a
ten. And then... it (exploding sound effect)

711
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:15,305
shatters, and then does-- where the fuck is it--
2d6 damage as well.

712
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:17,693
MATT: Okay, to her and everyone-- Go for it.

713
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:19,318
ORION: In a five-foot radius. So yeah...

714
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:20,268
MATT: Right.

715
00:47:20,268 --> 00:47:21,227
ORION: And that guy's like right next to her,
right?

716
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:22,050
MATT: Yeah.

717
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,555
TRAVIS: (whispering) Hey, Matt. How much damage
did I take?

718
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:25,217
MATT: What was the damage on the fireball?

719
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,020
ORION: 31.

720
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,520
MATT: 31? 31 points of fire damage.

721
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,640
TRAVIS: Cool.

722
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,191
ORION: Cool, and that's four points of damage to
both of them.

723
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:32,246
LAURA: Are you dead?

724
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:35,663
MATT: To both of them? All right. Well, for one,
four damage is enough, as the shards of ice from

725
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:42,474
the back of Ulara's torso explode into this spray
of jagged ice chunks. It pierces continuously the

726
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:48,574
right side of this dwarf, who then falls to the
ground, grasping at his wounds and trying to stand

727
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,987
to his feet before falling over unconscious right
there.

728
00:47:51,987 --> 00:47:58,134
ORION: And I have Greater Invisibility, so I'm
still invisible and I just peek back behind the

729
00:47:58,134 --> 00:47:59,246
rock.

730
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:06,198
MATT: (singing) Mysterious fireball, ice dagger
source. Okay. You come to consciousness, in

731
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:09,700
extreme pain as your entire body is immersed
briefly in flame.

732
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,140
TRAVIS: (painful roaring)

733
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,101
MATT: We'll get to that in a second. Vex. Vax,
sorry.

734
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:19,295
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use my feat, Cunning
Action, for one extra action per turn of combat,

735
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:24,540
use for either dash, disengage, or hide. So I'm
going to double distance and go one... two...

736
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:31,388
three, four, five-- I still can't see her-- six,
maybe... seven, eight, nine, ten. Stop right here

737
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:38,607
by Clarota. (over enunciating) Clarota-- Clarota!
And dagger, dagger at this jerkface over here.

738
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:39,410
MATT: Right here?

739
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,177
LIAM: Yep.

740
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:40,970
MATT: All right.

741
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,080
LIAM: That was stealthed, by the way.

742
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,601
MATT: Right, roll a stealth check.

743
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:49,427
LIAM: All right. Okay, and I'm going to use Luck.
Okay, so stealth is 23?

744
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:52,135
MATT: Okay.

745
00:48:52,135 --> 00:49:00,301
LIAM: And he hasn't gone yet, so for the
assassinate feat for rogues, if he hasn't gone

746
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:02,080
yet, this is a critical hit.

747
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,821
MATT: In theory, combat already began when he
attacked the rest of your party.

748
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:07,238
LIAM: Okay.

749
00:49:07,238 --> 00:49:08,377
MATT: Combat's begun. Sorry.

750
00:49:08,377 --> 00:49:13,497
LIAM: The feat says if you have the jump, if you
go before the person's gone, but we can talk about

751
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:14,283
that later...

752
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:17,335
MATT: Correct, but they've already attacked half
your party with the mind blast, so in theory the

753
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:18,619
battle's already begun.

754
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,236
LIAM: All right. Okay, so keen dagger flying
through the air...

755
00:49:21,236 --> 00:49:22,496
MATT: All right.

756
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:27,965
LIAM: Oh, I didn't hit to-- Okay, so that hits. 16
plus-- 27.

757
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,226
MATT: That definitively hits, yes.

758
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:33,242
LIAM: Okay, so three... plus (mumbles)

759
00:49:33,242 --> 00:49:34,246
LAURA: Kill him.

760
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:46,455
LIAM: (muttering numbers) 36 total.

761
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:52,916
MATT: 36 points of damage. All right. So, the mind
flayer, which is... After it finishes a mind

762
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:56,844
blast, you can see it beginning to eye what its
next target would be. As Percy goes running off to

763
00:49:56,844 --> 00:50:02,079
the side, it looks over at its three
freshly-stunned prey and begins to lumber towards

764
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:09,372
what looks to be either Pike or Vex. But before it
gets a chance to advance though, (whistling sound)

765
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:13,159
out of nowhere your dagger (impact sound) pierces
it in its shoulder. It looks at it and it grasps

766
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:17,156
for it. As its hand tries to pull the dagger out,
the dagger disappears in a plume of black shadow

767
00:50:17,156 --> 00:50:19,848
energy back into your hand as you throw the other
dagger.

768
00:50:19,848 --> 00:50:24,834
LIAM: Oh, sorry, asswipe! Okay, that is a 19.

769
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,488
MATT: 19 does also hit.

770
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:30,924
LIAM: And that is eight damage.

771
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:36,226
MATT: All right. The other dagger, the creature
actually puts up a little bit of a psychic field

772
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:40,373
for a second and it stops its momentum. It does
still manage to strike it, but with nowhere near

773
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:46,180
the damage you were hoping it would. Cool, that
ends your turn. That brings us to Scanlan.

774
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,561
SAM: Okay, so all that's remaining on the
battlefield is the queen and the mind flayer?

775
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:54,574
MATT: The mind flayer, the queen, and this duergar
here that has not acted yet.

776
00:50:54,574 --> 00:51:00,830
SAM: All right. (sighs) I'm going to just bum rush
the queen.

777
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,823
TRAVIS: Yes! I mean...

778
00:51:02,823 --> 00:51:09,371
SAM: And just dive at her. Just dive full,
head-on, straight for her and bear hug her with

779
00:51:09,371 --> 00:51:10,879
Banishment.

780
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:12,879
ORION: Oh yeah, baby!

781
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:15,277
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

782
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:16,867
ORION: You know you can cast that from a
distance?

783
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:18,780
SAM: No, you have to-- it's touch.

784
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,672
ORION: Is it? Oh!

785
00:51:19,672 --> 00:51:20,528
MATT: Yeah, it's a touch spell.

786
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:21,405
SAM: It's touch.

787
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:25,185
MATT: All right. So. What's your spell DC? I
assume you're using your hand cone?

788
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,318
SAM: I do most things through that.

789
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,840
MATT: As you charge forward, you pull out your
enchanted hand cone and shout the incantation

790
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,310
towards her with an angry glare.

791
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,061
SAM: Ooh, get lost, motherfucker!

792
00:51:33,061 --> 00:51:35,326
(all laugh)

793
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,112
MATT: It had a DC of 19 for that?

794
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:38,106
SAM: Yeah.

795
00:51:38,106 --> 00:51:44,235
MATT: Okay, even with her spell resistance, she
does not resist it.

796
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:49,509
SAM: It's not you it's me.

797
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:52,771
(all laugh)

798
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,359
MATT: Is it an intelligence or wisdom save?

799
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:05,497
SAM: Oh. I don't know things. Target, plane of
existence, banishment... I don't know. Where does

800
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,596
it say?

801
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:08,800
MATT: It should say what saving throw it is.

802
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,801
SAM: Find it.

803
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,611
(all laugh)

804
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:17,145
MATT: I will do this for you. On a charisma saving
throw or be banished. So, if it was on anything

805
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:21,539
but a charisma saving throw, she would have
shrugged it. Charisma, she does not have in

806
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:26,634
spades. As you reach out, she pulls back and you
see her beginning to form this crackling bolt of

807
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:30,069
energy you've seen once before in the throne room
that shot out and hit multiple members of your

808
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:34,018
party once for a severe amount of damage. This
would have been a very dangerous round if you

809
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:37,574
hadn't connected with her right in front of her
clavicle. She looks at you with this look of

810
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:44,549
confusion and completely caught-off-guard
frustration before her entire form (sucking sound)

811
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:47,470
blinks out of existence and is no longer visible
on the board.

812
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,509
LIAM: Bard ass!

813
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:49,601
SAM: Yes!

814
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,273
TRAVIS: Get the hell out of there (laughs)

815
00:52:51,273 --> 00:52:53,436
SAM: Do I get my bonus?

816
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,524
MATT: Yeah!

817
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:57,100
SAM: I'm going to give inspiration to Grog because
he needs it.

818
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,228
MATT: All right. So Grog, as the flames die down,
you look over and watch Scanlan rush up and

819
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:07,357
completely, as far as you know, disintegrate the
duergar queen who took you and has been torturing

820
00:53:07,357 --> 00:53:08,778
you these past few days--

821
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:09,821
TRAVIS: Wow.

822
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:12,399
(all laugh)

823
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:15,777
MATT: With that, he looks over to you and gives
you a little wink and a smile. Go ahead and take

824
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,119
an inspiration dice, which for him is now a d10.

825
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,857
LAURA: An upgrade!

826
00:53:19,857 --> 00:53:21,654
TRAVIS: Heck yeah.

827
00:53:21,654 --> 00:53:28,560
MATT: So you can add that inspiration die to any
ability checks, any skill checks, saving throws.

828
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,659
SAM: For instance, busting through iron bars.

829
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:33,277
TRAVIS: Thank you, thank you.

830
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:37,939
MATT: All right, well, it would be Ulara's turn.
She's going to go ahead and attempt to make her

831
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:44,547
saving throw. Does not make it. Still somewhere in
some other plane that you're unaware of.

832
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:46,294
SAM: She's in a better place.

833
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:47,614
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn.

834
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:53,219
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to phase through the
ground because I can. And pop up right there next

835
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,282
to Grog.

836
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:58,387
MATT: All right. (crashing sound) Grog, you, all
of sudden, as you look over from Scanlan with this

837
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:02,541
smiling face, this giant mountain of rock and
earth just lumbers up out of the ground.

838
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,183
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh shit!

839
00:54:04,183 --> 00:54:08,936
MARISHA: And in rock speak, I say, "Grog it's
okay. It's Keyleth"

840
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:12,703
MATT: You hear (makes deep gargled sounds)

841
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:14,489
TRAVIS: (screams in terror)

842
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,143
MATT: (laughs)

843
00:54:16,143 --> 00:54:18,671
MARISHA: I still don't really grasp that you
can't--

844
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:21,490
MATT: It's your first time doing elemental form;
you're still trying to figure it out.

845
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:28,973
MARISHA: Seeing that he's still tied up, I'm going
to pick up the whole crate and put him over my--

846
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,248
no I'm going to football carry him like this.

847
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:32,560
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

848
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,464
SAM: Is he on something?

849
00:54:34,464 --> 00:54:36,530
MATT: He's strapped to a giant cart.

850
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,908
SAM: She's carrying the whole thing?

851
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:38,556
MATT: Yeah.

852
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:39,500
SAM: Awesome.

853
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,605
MATT: Because earth elemental.

854
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:41,458
SAM: Awesome.

855
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,119
MATT: So you're there, now you still have about--
what's the speed of?

856
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,711
MARISHA: 30.

857
00:54:44,711 --> 00:54:49,234
MATT: 30. So you've got about, say, ten more
squares, or I'm sorry ten more feet you can go.

858
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:51,837
MARISHA: I'm going to start football rushing that
way.

859
00:54:51,837 --> 00:54:55,183
MATT: This way? All right, one, two, all right
there we go.

860
00:54:55,183 --> 00:54:57,311
MARISHA: Get the fuck out!

861
00:54:57,311 --> 00:55:00,397
MATT: You're now being carried by this giant
lumbering earth elemental that is just bringing

862
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:10,546
you under its arm. Great! Vex? Do you make your
saving throw? Intelligence.

863
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:12,281
LAURA: Plus intelligence?

864
00:55:12,281 --> 00:55:14,584
MATT: Intelligence saving throw, that should be at
the top.

865
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:15,433
LAURA: 23!

866
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:20,155
MATT: 23. Using your mind, you shrug off the
remainder of the ability. That does end your turn,

867
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:22,187
but you're no longer stunned, which is nice.

868
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:23,826
LAURA: That's great, that's the end of my turn?

869
00:55:23,826 --> 00:55:24,666
MATT: That's the end of your turn.

870
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:25,992
LAURA: Do I roll it for Trinket too?

871
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:27,450
MATT: Yes, Trinket as well, thank you.

872
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:32,828
LAURA: Little Trinket gets the little bitty dice.
Oh, I don't think he got it. No, he still rolled

873
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:33,781
an eight.

874
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:38,210
MATT: Yeah, so Trinket's still on the ground,
slowly digging his nose into the dirt, trying to

875
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:38,993
find a way to his--

876
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:40,240
LAURA: Oh! Does that mean he takes more damage?

877
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,237
MATT: No more damage, but currently is unable to
function.

878
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:43,306
LIAM: He's dreaming of honey.

879
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,926
LAURA: Okay. He's dreaming of pain.

880
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:49,361
MATT: Yeah, very bad news. Okay. That brings us to
Pike, who's also going to try and make her saving

881
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:54,682
throw. Fails it, unfortunately. Pike dropped her
shield, dropped her mace, and is clutching the

882
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:59,073
side of her head, screaming silently as the pain
is wracking her brain from the inside.

883
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:06,815
That brings us to this duergar, who's going to
rush over to the one who just banished his queen

884
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:12,335
and attempt to-- his physical form begins to swell
with strength and frustration. The duergar swings

885
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,171
at you with his war pick. That is...

886
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:18,930
SAM: "(singing) Oh, don't hit me!" I cast a little
count, cutting-- what is it?

887
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,784
MATT: Cutting Words?

888
00:56:19,784 --> 00:56:21,059
SAM: Cutting Words.

889
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:26,600
MATT: Okay. So it's a 16. Go ahead and roll your
d10 number. It's a d10 now.

890
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,907
SAM: That's d10?

891
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:29,254
MATT: It's a d10 now. You leveled up, yeah!

892
00:56:29,254 --> 00:56:30,482
SAM: I don't even-- I've never rolled a d10
before! (laughs)

893
00:56:30,482 --> 00:56:31,574
MATT: Now you have!

894
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:32,736
SAM: This is a d10?

895
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:35,238
MATT: Yep, so it's a 16.

896
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:37,025
SAM: It was a four.

897
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:40,010
MATT: It was a four, so it takes that down from a
16 to a 12, which does miss.

898
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:40,841
SAM: He misses!

899
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,506
(all laugh)

900
00:56:42,506 --> 00:56:43,765
MATT: So as he rushes towards you--

901
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:45,164
SAM: (singing) No, don't hit me!

902
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:51,881
MATT: He stops for a second, confused. He puts the
war pick down for a second like, "Wait-- argh!

903
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:59,526
"(groans) You gnome!" Doesn't know why he listened
to you and is equally frustrated with himself now

904
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:01,203
as he is you. (laughs)

905
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:03,825
TRAVIS: So good.

906
00:57:03,825 --> 00:57:09,065
MATT: All right. That ends the duergar's turn.
That brings us to--

907
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:10,518
LIAM: Here comes the illithid.

908
00:57:10,518 --> 00:57:15,469
MATT: Not yet. This is going to be, Kima is going
to try and make her saving throw. Kima does make

909
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:19,410
it! Does shrug off the effect. Turns around
angrily, holding the greatsword that you gave her,

910
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:23,885
staring off at the mind flayer right there.

911
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:32,289
Clarota, however, is going to go ahead and turn
this way. Coalesce a giant ball of electrical

912
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:38,875
energy into his hand, and release an arcing blast
of lightning energy towards this mind flayer, who

913
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:44,707
does make its saving throw. However, it's still a
nice 8d6 lightning damage.

914
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:49,259
SAM: Do they know each other? Are they friends?

915
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:50,863
TALIESIN: Not anymore.

916
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:51,833
TRAVIS: Soulmates.

917
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,149
LAURA: I think that guy dated Clarota's
ex-girlfriend.

918
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:58,637
MATT: So, 20 points of lightning damage. As the
blue energy arcs off, and you see it grounds

919
00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:03,439
itself on the incline of this tunnel you
guys, have, heading down, the mind flayer visibly

920
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:08,840
is burned, charred, wounded. It looks really
really rough. That ends Clarota's turn,

921
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,879
Kima's turn.

922
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:16,541
Back to the top of the round. The mind flayer
looks at its certain circumstance. Puts its hands

923
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,161
together like this, it seems to concentrate...

924
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,798
ORION: I see it, I cast Counterspell! (fwoosh)

925
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:31,470
MATT: Okay. All right, it's a reflex. Counterspell
in this edition is so good.

926
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,921
LAURA: That's great.

927
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,663
MATT: All right so... this would be Counterspell.

928
00:58:34,663 --> 00:58:37,316
LIAM: Come on Tibs. Tibber-hoods.

929
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:50,365
MATT: All right, Counterspell, so make an ability
check, so add a d20 plus five to it.

930
00:58:50,503 --> 00:58:54,090
SAM: That's nothing, that's no numbers.

931
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:55,307
MARISHA: Oh, there we go.

932
00:58:55,307 --> 00:58:56,766
SAM: That's a good number.

933
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,540
ORION: What is that? 22.

934
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:05,223
MATT: 22? That'll do it. So as this entity you've
seen before, they tend to like create this small

935
00:59:05,223 --> 00:59:09,943
localized portal into some other plane, and then
like step through and vanish. You see it begins to

936
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:13,201
coalesce the same arcane energy, and for a moment
you see a spark of some sort of door beginning to

937
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:19,384
open. As Tiberius steps from behind the rock,
releases this torrent of sparkling arcane energy

938
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:23,719
that closes the gate entirely and the mind flayer
for a second looks confused before it, across the

939
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:26,319
way to wherever it came from and sees nothing.

940
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,490
LIAM: Oh, so sorry.

941
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,054
TRAVIS: Are you still invisible?

942
00:59:29,054 --> 00:59:30,324
TALIESIN: So sad, so sad.

943
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:33,791
MATT: And is going to turn tail and run.

944
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,408
LAURA: (gasp) Just running?

945
00:59:35,408 --> 00:59:36,193
TRAVIS: With his feet?

946
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:37,154
LAURA: Can I shoot him?

947
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:38,052
SAM: He ran?

948
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:42,082
MATT: Well, yeah essentially levitating away.

949
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,446
TRAVIS: Does he have a goofy run?

950
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:48,995
MATT: It's more, its a gliding. it's a (whoosh)
About five or six inches off the ground.

951
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:50,429
MARISHA: Shoot her!

952
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:51,667
MATT: Percy, you're up.

953
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:52,822
LAURA: Shoot him, Percy!

954
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:58,745
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards--
who's buggering Scanlan over there?

955
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:00,295
MATT: A duergar.

956
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:04,526
TALIESIN: It's a duergar? I'm just going to take a
shot at him really quick.

957
01:00:04,526 --> 01:00:05,736
SAM: Don't hit me!

958
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:06,689
MATT: Okay.

959
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:07,673
TALIESIN: Not going to hit you.

960
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:09,571
MATT: Hard to see him right now; there's a big
tent in the way, if you want to take a step

961
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,773
forward, continue moving.

962
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,600
TALIESIN: I'll take a step forward, I'm going to
continue moving, this is going

963
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,859
to be a running shot.

964
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:17,597
MATT: Okay. So, as you turn, pull your gun off to
the side, (explosion) offhand fire--

965
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:18,584
TALIESIN: 18?

966
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:19,377
MATT: 18 does hit.

967
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:22,504
SAM: I don't like guns.

968
01:00:22,504 --> 01:00:29,260
TALIESIN: That's-- don't go anywhere. That's nine
damage.

969
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,953
MATT: Nine damage, all right.

970
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:33,547
TALIESIN: And I'm going to shoot again.

971
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,135
MATT: All right.

972
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,275
TALIESIN: 18.

973
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:38,082
MATT: 18. That also hits.

974
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:39,002
LIAM: Bad News.

975
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,775
TALIESIN: Eight damage. Bad News has not come out
yet! This is just my little Pepperbox.

976
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:46,189
MATT: All right, so, as you turn the corner, you
fire once, take another step forward, go (click)

977
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:50,465
click over the next barrel, fire a second time.
The duergar which was attacking you-- you see part

978
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:53,963
of it's still burnt from the fireball which was
tossed the first round-- he's frustrated and angry

979
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:56,503
that you caused him to somehow lower his guard
when he attacked you last.

980
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:57,583
SAM: Yeah!

981
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,142
(all laugh)

982
01:00:59,142 --> 01:01:02,378
MATT: You see him gearing up for another
two-handed strike down at this tiny gnome

983
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:08,137
character in front of him. The first blow hits the
war pick, knocking it out of his hands. He looks

984
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:12,017
over, confused, at you as the second blast hits
him right in the side of the face, completely

985
01:01:12,017 --> 01:01:17,955
destroying this side of his head entirely. This
wet gurgle as the duergar slumps to the ground,

986
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:21,762
almost on top of you, but you step out of the way
as his body (boof) hits the ground right there.

987
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:22,955
LAURA: Nice. Nice, Percy!

988
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,415
TALIESIN: Bam.

989
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,070
LIAM: Where does he get such wonderful toys?!

990
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,624
TALIESIN: I make them!

991
01:01:27,624 --> 01:01:28,913
MATT: That's Percy's turn. Tiberius?

992
01:01:28,913 --> 01:01:31,341
SAM: You want to chase them?

993
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:37,794
ORION: I'm going to slink my way all the way
behind the other rock.

994
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,890
MATT: Over here?

995
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,388
ORION: Towards everybody, closer. Yeah, back,
there you go.

996
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:43,361
MATT: Okay.

997
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:54,105
ORION: I'm going to... Yeah, screw it, I'll do
another Fireball at the illithid going away.

998
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:56,631
Where do you think you're going? (fwoosh)

999
01:01:56,631 --> 01:02:03,729
MATT: So, as you fire this beam over here, it
detonates in the distance, safely far enough away

1000
01:02:03,729 --> 01:02:07,237
from the party. Go ahead and roll damage for that
fireball. As the mind flayer that is drifting away

1001
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:12,385
glances over its shoulder, you see its greenish
glowing eyes go wide for a second, cartoon-style,

1002
01:02:12,385 --> 01:02:13,713
"oh, shit!"

1003
01:02:13,713 --> 01:02:17,289
TRAVIS: Did you go, "Fireball!" as you do it?
Hadouken!

1004
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:26,889
MATT: And, with its advantage against the spell--
it's a dexterity save, correct?

1005
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:28,238
ORION: Yeah, so that's--

1006
01:02:28,238 --> 01:02:30,039
MATT: Doesn't make it.

1007
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,539
ORION: 19.

1008
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:35,553
MATT: 19, all right, 19 damage?

1009
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:36,539
ORION: Yep.

1010
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:42,124
MATT: Okay, as the mind flayer's drifting away,
you guys see this arc of red, beaming energy

1011
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:47,517
(whoosh) off in the distance. (explosion) You see
rocks cascade off the top of the wall, hitting the

1012
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:54,914
ground with a force as the entire tunnel shakes
and rocks. As the smoke and the flames dissipate,

1013
01:02:54,914 --> 01:03:00,405
all you see is this pile of blackened creature on
the ground from where the mind flayer once stood.

1014
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:04,379
TRAVIS: Oh, peace out! Mind gobbler.

1015
01:03:04,379 --> 01:03:06,263
LAURA: Is that everybody's?

1016
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:10,167
SAM: Fellows! Gather around. She might come back
at any moment and we should be here to surround

1017
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,318
her when she comes back.

1018
01:03:11,318 --> 01:03:12,564
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

1019
01:03:12,564 --> 01:03:14,329
SAM: And someone get Grog out of that thing!

1020
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:15,971
ORION: Oh, crap, I forgot about that one.

1021
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:18,617
LAURA: Yeah, how do we get Grog out?

1022
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:19,453
MATT: Grog.

1023
01:03:19,453 --> 01:03:20,404
TRAVIS: What?

1024
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:22,174
MATT: While they're all doing this, what do you
want to do?

1025
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,314
TRAVIS: Well, am I still chained up to the cart?

1026
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:26,916
MATT: Yeah, these iron bands are across your
entire body.

1027
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,627
LAURA: Being carried by an earth elemental.

1028
01:03:28,627 --> 01:03:35,105
TRAVIS: Excuse me, giant rock thing. Could you
perhaps get me out of this shit?

1029
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:39,546
LIAM: I start hiking back towards Grog.

1030
01:03:39,546 --> 01:03:45,373
LAURA: Pike and Trinket, are they still stunned,
or are they... better?

1031
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:49,167
MATT: They've shrugged it off by now.

1032
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:56,588
LAURA: Okay. Then I run over and try to see what I
can do.

1033
01:03:56,588 --> 01:04:00,087
MATT: Ulara still can't make her saving throw for
the life of her, even with resistance.

1034
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:03,477
LAURA: Can I go try to mess with the things on--

1035
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:09,073
MATT: Oh, yeah. As you guys approach, and begin
making your way up to the front here, grab these

1036
01:04:09,073 --> 01:04:10,852
duergar.

1037
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:15,271
ORION: And I'll move on the other side of that
rock so I can see better and have line of sight.

1038
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,222
MATT: Over here?

1039
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:18,233
ORION: No, on that side, yeah.

1040
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:24,408
MATT: Okay. All right, so. As the rest of you all
slowly trudge up and gather around this vicinity.

1041
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,785
LAURA: Grog! Are you hurt?

1042
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:28,457
TRAVIS: I can't tell yet.

1043
01:04:28,457 --> 01:04:30,354
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my distance.

1044
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:31,578
MATT: There?

1045
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:32,501
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1046
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,341
MATT: All right, so.

1047
01:04:33,341 --> 01:04:35,003
TRAVIS: I'm still in this wonderful therapeutic
chair.

1048
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:39,462
MATT: So you go ahead and you try and pull the
bars off? Is that what you're doing? What are you

1049
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:40,233
doing?

1050
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:41,221
TRAVIS: Are they bars?

1051
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:42,459
MATT: They're iron bands that surround you.

1052
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:45,273
MARISHA: Don't want to hurt him.

1053
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:47,465
TRAVIS: But it's a wooden cart?

1054
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:48,881
Is it a wooden cart?

1055
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:49,714
LAURA: Maybe bust the wood on the bottom.

1056
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:50,775
TRAVIS: Or just smash the cart.

1057
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:51,875
SAM: Or he can pick a lock.

1058
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:53,919
LIAM: It's what I do.

1059
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:55,585
MARISHA: Oh, is there a lock on the bars? Yeah.

1060
01:04:55,585 --> 01:04:56,625
MATT: Yeah, there's an intricate lock mechanism.

1061
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,234
MARISHA: Try that first before I suplex Grog.

1062
01:04:58,234 --> 01:05:01,481
MATT: All right, so, so the earth elemental
lumbers forth and presents the cart on the ground

1063
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,560
in front of you (impact sound). One of the wheels
(breaking noise).

1064
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:06,689
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1065
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:08,286
MATT: Cracks a little bit in the process.

1066
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:12,859
LIAM: "Give me a little space. Let me look at
this." Can I detect traps on his bands?

1067
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:18,913
SAM: Checking for traps?! She could come back at
any second, hurry up!

1068
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:21,767
LAURA: I keep my arrow notched.

1069
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:23,246
LIAM: That's a 17.

1070
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:24,492
LAURA: In case she does come back.

1071
01:05:24,492 --> 01:05:25,448
MATT: 17?

1072
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:26,208
LIAM: Yeah.

1073
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,659
MATT: Okay. They appear to be just general locks.

1074
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:29,969
LIAM: And are there locks contraptions on them?

1075
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,151
MATT: There is a lock on them, yes. So go ahead
and make your--

1076
01:05:32,151 --> 01:05:34,659
LIAM: 19.

1077
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:40,258
MATT: 19. (tink) The band that's part way across
the waist opens freely on

1078
01:05:40,258 --> 01:05:41,988
the hinge on the one side.

1079
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:43,100
TRAVIS: Was there just one?

1080
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,300
MATT: Yeah, that was the one.

1081
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,499
TRAVIS: (groans in relief) Oh my god!

1082
01:05:47,499 --> 01:05:50,177
MATT: So go ahead and make an athletics check. I
mean, there's multiple bands around you. Across

1083
01:05:50,177 --> 01:05:54,486
your shoulders, your torso, your legs, your
ankles.

1084
01:05:54,486 --> 01:05:55,797
LIAM: I'm going to move on to the next one.

1085
01:05:55,797 --> 01:05:57,919
TRAVIS: 25.

1086
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:00,330
LIAM: And a 25 on my lock pick.

1087
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:06,100
MATT: Okay, you get a second band. You rolled a
25? And Marisha, do you want to go ahead and make

1088
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,419
an athletics check as well? Or that would be a
strength check for you.

1089
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:09,466
MARISHA: For what?

1090
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,989
MATT: For your form, your elemental form, to try
and pull the bands off of Grog.

1091
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:13,988
MARISHA: Okay.

1092
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:15,086
MATT: Unless you want to do something else.

1093
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:17,280
TALIESIN: I'm going to recommend to Pike that she
do a bit of healing.

1094
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,240
LAURA: Oh, Pike! Can you heal Trinket. He's really
almost dead.

1095
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,706
SAM: Is Pike okay?

1096
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:24,127
MATT: Pike comes over and spends a 3rd-level
healing spell.

1097
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,752
MARISHA: I failed.

1098
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:28,012
LAURA: You failed what?

1099
01:06:28,012 --> 01:06:30,112
TALIESIN: Life. Oh wow! Yeah, you did.

1100
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:31,344
MARISHA: Strength check.

1101
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:33,643
MATT: Okay, Trinket heals 21.

1102
01:06:33,643 --> 01:06:34,929
LAURA: Oh, good.

1103
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:39,303
LIAM: Vax is moving to the next band. That's a
24.

1104
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:41,655
TRAVIS: I got a 25, does that not help?

1105
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:46,059
MATT: Yeah, between the two of you, over the next
few seconds or so, you pick the next one and with

1106
01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:51,876
that remaining push, you force the rest of the
bands off. Grog, you make

1107
01:06:51,876 --> 01:06:53,109
your way up to your feet.

1108
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,594
TRAVIS: (groans in relief)

1109
01:06:54,594 --> 01:07:00,098
MATT: There we go! At that point in time, there's
a slight ripple in the space right before this

1110
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:05,731
fire pit, and in that place Ulara, Queen Ulara,
reappears again.

1111
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:06,881
SAM: Hold her!

1112
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:07,931
LAURA: I've been waiting for it.

1113
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:09,337
MARISHA: Can I grab her?

1114
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:10,788
ORION: Wait, can I do something? Can we react to
this?

1115
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:11,594
MATT: Yeah.

1116
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,768
ORION: I see it and I cast Hold Person.

1117
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:24,182
MATT: Okay. All right. As you finish the spell,
you can see this glow of yellowish holding energy,

1118
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:29,699
almost like these mystical shackles, begin to
tighten around her and then fade, unaffected.

1119
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:31,360
LAURA: I release an arrow!

1120
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,836
SAM: I also cast Hold Person.

1121
01:07:32,836 --> 01:07:36,295
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and loose your arrow.
So go ahead and roll for your attack. All right.

1122
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:42,013
LAURA: 29.

1123
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:47,969
MATT: 29? Okay, that does hit. You can see now,
the second set of shackles spins around her, she

1124
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:53,179
brings her hand up like this and they just scatter
around her, resisting a second Hold Person. Now

1125
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:55,055
all her saving throws are coming through.

1126
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:59,098
MARISHA: Can I just grab her as an earth
elemental. Just like (mumbles with a deep voice).

1127
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:01,386
MATT: If you want to.

1128
01:08:01,386 --> 01:08:02,256
MARISHA: Yeah.

1129
01:08:02,256 --> 01:08:03,480
MATT: So, damage on the attack?

1130
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,735
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark her, as well.

1131
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:09,767
MATT: Oh there you go. See that, chatroom?

1132
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:15,004
LAURA: What is that? 13?

1133
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,313
LIAM: 12.

1134
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:21,330
LAURA: 12! Plus... That's 16 total.

1135
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,704
MATT: 16 damage, all right.

1136
01:08:23,704 --> 01:08:26,103
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a headshot with Bad
News.

1137
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,200
LIAM: Wait!

1138
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,405
TALIESIN: Oh, are you doing something?

1139
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:29,647
LAURA: We need to talk to her.

1140
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,538
TALIESIN: Okay.

1141
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:32,975
MARISHA: I bear hug her.

1142
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,702
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make an athletics
check.

1143
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:40,900
MARISHA: Athletics, I don't have that.

1144
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,847
MATT: I know, it's just a strength check, then.
Roll a d20 and add your strength modifier.

1145
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:48,950
MARISHA: Ooh, that's better! 23.

1146
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:54,029
MATT: 23. You bound up behind her and as she looks
over her shoulder, the arrow piercing her

1147
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,408
shoulder. She's looking pretty rough, you can see
the blood beginning to pool underneath her robe

1148
01:08:57,408 --> 01:08:59,963
there. Her eyes go wide.

1149
01:08:59,963 --> 01:09:02,462
LAURA: It would be in your best interest to not
struggle.

1150
01:09:02,462 --> 01:09:05,696
MATT: At which point, the giant arms go (impact
noise) behind her and the earth elemental lifts

1151
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:10,606
her off her feet. (groans in pain) You can see her
now, her feet dangling angrily in the air. A

1152
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:22,363
couple of seconds pass before she, "(pants) All
right. So, let's make a deal, shall we?"

1153
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:26,853
LAURA: (laughs) You're in no place to negotiate.

1154
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:31,437
SAM: We have everything that we have come here
for. What can you possibly offer us that we don't

1155
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:32,779
already have?

1156
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:35,857
MATT: "Valid point. What purpose do I serve? You
should let me go."

1157
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:41,237
SAM: Let you go?! I tried to talk to you and you
almost tried to get us killed!

1158
01:09:41,237 --> 01:09:47,925
LIAM: Vox Machina, our purposes here are done, but
Lady Kima, she has further to go, and I am

1159
01:09:47,925 --> 01:09:57,987
curious, your Highness, if you know anything about
this K'Varn chap or gal or thing? We have heard

1160
01:09:57,987 --> 01:10:02,751
his or her name. They seem to be famous in these
parts. I was wondering if

1161
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:06,137
you know anything about K'Varn.

1162
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:08,241
MATT: Are you rolling Persuasion for this?

1163
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:11,974
LIAM: Yes, I am. So well. That's a two.

1164
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,381
LAURA: So bad.

1165
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:21,413
MATT: She goes, "I know many things." And she
leans forward a little bit and then spits right in

1166
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:22,592
your face.

1167
01:10:22,592 --> 01:10:24,701
LAURA: Oh! Wonderful. Clarota, do you want to suck
her mind?

1168
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:27,079
MARISHA: I tighten my grip on her a bit.

1169
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:28,985
LIAM: Vex'ahlia, would you come up and talk to
this--

1170
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:30,412
LAURA: I'm already here.

1171
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:35,118
MATT: Clarota, at which steps forward and brings
his hand up.

1172
01:10:35,118 --> 01:10:38,351
MARISHA: Oh, that's true. We don't need her, we
just need her brain.

1173
01:10:38,351 --> 01:10:46,158
MATT: As Clarota steps forward, putting his hand
out, this voice echoes through all of your minds

1174
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:56,263
communally. "Now... tell us what you know." And you
see his eyes flicker with a strange blue energy.

1175
01:10:56,263 --> 01:10:58,535
LIAM: Yeah, Professor X.

1176
01:10:58,535 --> 01:11:00,749
TALIESIN: Man's got to eat.

1177
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:06,595
MATT: And you see Ulara's eyes glaze over and
fill with the same blue arcane energy that Clarota

1178
01:11:06,783 --> 01:11:15,381
was briefly having drift out of his eyes. Ulara
stops struggling and the mouth goes into this

1179
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:22,940
weird grin for a second and just calmly says,
"Liberation. Liberation is what it brings us.

1180
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:30,128
"Liberation from physical limitation. Liberation
from the pain of the light." And she looks up as

1181
01:11:30,224 --> 01:11:43,166
she says that. "We all shall rise. K'Varn, the
Guiding Darkness. The sun shall hold no sway and

1182
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:46,704
"we shall walk the surface once again."

1183
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:48,659
ORION: What is all this poppycock?!

1184
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:50,865
LAURA: What is K'Varn?

1185
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:58,596
MATT: "K'Varn came to us, showed us how through
unification we could be better than we ever were."

1186
01:11:58,596 --> 01:12:03,336
LAURA: I didn't ask what he did, I asked what he
is.

1187
01:12:03,336 --> 01:12:07,312
MATT: "K'Varn--" At which point, there's a shudder
in her body and her eyes go from this strange blue

1188
01:12:07,312 --> 01:12:14,906
color to this strange swimming black that covers
the entirety of each eye. At which point, she

1189
01:12:14,906 --> 01:12:22,051
shakes for a second. Her shoulders shift and you
clutch her in your arms. As you do, you see the

1190
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:29,387
blackness now has that same green glow that the
rest of them had, but it's framing the pools of

1191
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:33,402
shadow that her eyes have become.

1192
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:45,093
Her jaw falls slack for a second and this voice
comes through. "Ah, there! (chuckles) There we

1193
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:49,543
"are. I can see you all so clearly."

1194
01:12:49,543 --> 01:12:51,687
ORION: Not me!

1195
01:12:51,687 --> 01:12:54,797
MATT: "You'd be surprised, dragonborn."

1196
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:56,159
(all gasp)

1197
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,582
ORION: You're pretty good.

1198
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:01,974
(all laugh)

1199
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:17,331
MATT: "Word has reached my ears, but to see you,
to look upon you, is everything. Come. You are

1200
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:28,631
"close, yes? Come to me, as my guests. I invite
you. The temple doors are open. I'd like to see

1201
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:30,254
"you in person."

1202
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:34,803
ORION: (stammers) Can you be more specific? Like,
do we go left, or right, or... specific.

1203
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:46,483
MATT: "You're already on the right path. Come to
me. You are my treasured guests." At which point,

1204
01:13:46,483 --> 01:13:52,107
the blackness in the eyes begins to intensify and
begin to spill like black tears from the face. Her

1205
01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:56,713
body shudders before the back convulses, and then
falls limp, a little bit of

1206
01:13:56,713 --> 01:13:58,308
smoke rising from the mouth.

1207
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,920
LAURA: I check her pulse.

1208
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,343
MATT: She has definitely given up the ghost.

1209
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,843
SAM: Try to heal her?

1210
01:14:04,843 --> 01:14:08,070
LAURA: Does she have anything awesome on that we
can take?

1211
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,203
TALIESIN: I wasn't going to say it.

1212
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:11,398
SAM: You're looting her already?!

1213
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:13,709
TALIESIN: I was waiting for someone else to say
it.

1214
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:15,059
LIAM: What a mercenary.

1215
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:18,664
LAURA: Is she dead? Can we take her outfit?
(laughs)

1216
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:25,971
MATT: All right, so as you guys glance around you
find-- other than the usual assortment of objects

1217
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:29,456
you find are the armor the duergar, the Emberhold,
make.

1218
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:33,069
LIAM: Vax'ildan is going to go pick at the charred
remains of the illithid.

1219
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,777
SAM: I'm going into the tent to look.

1220
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:36,371
ORION: I want to check out the queen.

1221
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:42,820
MATT: Okay. You go and check out the charred
remains. They are charred. They are remains. There

1222
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:48,170
is what looks to be about 86 gold on the body, but
most anything of use has been charred or

1223
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:53,463
destroyed. There is the remnants of a breastplate
that is burned over that most of the mind flayers

1224
01:14:53,463 --> 01:14:55,387
use as a basic form of protection.

1225
01:14:55,387 --> 01:15:02,792
As you inspect her body, as the earth elemental
drops her (boof) with a thud to the ground--

1226
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,515
ORION: I rolled an 18 for arcana, and you know I
wanted to check for--

1227
01:15:05,515 --> 01:15:11,220
MATT: Okay. You do notice there's a silver circlet
across her forehead that does give off a magical

1228
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:19,688
aura. She carries on her one viscous, reddish
potion that is familiar to you in the healing

1229
01:15:19,688 --> 01:15:23,689
accoutrement of various potions you've had in the
past. It is a potion of greater healing.

1230
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:27,470
LAURA: Yeah, and we haven't used the yellow potion
yet.

1231
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:28,679
TRAVIS: And nobody ever drank that?

1232
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:29,830
ORION AND LAURA: No.

1233
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:33,807
MATT: There is another potion that has almost a
blue, frosty color to it as you take the vial from

1234
01:15:33,807 --> 01:15:40,475
where it sits in the rest. The actual glass that
contains the liquid has a layer of frost crystals

1235
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:44,040
around it.

1236
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:48,328
TALIESIN: I'm going to remember that you're the
one who suggests drinking random, yellow liquids

1237
01:15:48,328 --> 01:15:51,719
and I'm going to bring you a vial of yellow
liquid. I'm just saying.

1238
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:54,075
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1239
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:55,259
LIAM: Me? Yeah, sorry.

1240
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,283
LAURA: Can I also check-- We already checked the
queen? You already checked the queen?

1241
01:15:58,283 --> 01:16:00,633
MATT: He's almost done with checking the queen.

1242
01:16:00,633 --> 01:16:03,989
LAURA: Can we check the elf and the dwarf that we
knocked out, as well?

1243
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:04,925
MATT: Yes, you can.

1244
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:07,430
TRAVIS: And can I ask Pike to heal me, because I
look like a game of tic-tac-toe?

1245
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,540
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1246
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,771
LAURA: I know, we should check on Grog.

1247
01:16:09,771 --> 01:16:12,497
TRAVIS: Oh, no, don't think of me, please. I've
only been fucking missing for two weeks.

1248
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:14,412
LAURA: You're standing up? I'm so happy you're
back with us.

1249
01:16:14,412 --> 01:16:17,648
MATT: What'd you roll on investigation?

1250
01:16:17,648 --> 01:16:18,452
LIAM: 13.

1251
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:21,730
MATT: 13? Okay. You can't seem to find anything
out of the remains of the mind flayer,

1252
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:22,848
unfortunately.

1253
01:16:22,848 --> 01:16:25,514
MARISHA: I drop my earth elemental form.

1254
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:31,129
MATT: Okay. (shoomf) The earth around your form
seems to crumble, like a layer of rock. It hits

1255
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:33,253
the ground and dissolves into the stone beneath
you.

1256
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:35,290
LAURA: See? I told you it was Keyleth.

1257
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:39,046
MARISHA: Were you watching, Grog? Grog, you
weren't watching.

1258
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:44,004
TRAVIS: No, totally was. It was amazing what you
did. Could you do it again?

1259
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:47,907
MARISHA: After we take a short rest.

1260
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:51,129
SAM: Anything in the tent?

1261
01:16:51,129 --> 01:16:58,464
MATT: You check inside. It looks like there's some
traveling blankets, some furs. You do also find a

1262
01:16:58,464 --> 01:17:03,505
small case that contains a bunch of empty vials.
There is one filled vial. A very large vial.

1263
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:09,445
SAM: Oh. Superior healing. All right. Great.

1264
01:17:09,445 --> 01:17:11,108
MATT: And you find--

1265
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:15,049
TRAVIS: (whispers) Can you fucking heal me,
please? Can you please heal me?

1266
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:16,451
SAM: What the hell?

1267
01:17:16,451 --> 01:17:18,455
ORION: I place the circlet on my head.

1268
01:17:18,455 --> 01:17:20,786
LAURA AND SAM: What is it?

1269
01:17:20,786 --> 01:17:22,474
LIAM: Probably a cursed item.

1270
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:25,142
MATT: You can't have it with an Ioun Stone either,
by the way. It's one or the other.

1271
01:17:25,142 --> 01:17:26,894
ORION: (stammering) I thought that was a...

1272
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:28,621
MATT: It's a head slot.

1273
01:17:28,621 --> 01:17:33,129
ORION: And for Ioun Stones I can have up to three
in the head slot?

1274
01:17:33,129 --> 01:17:34,169
MATT: Correct.

1275
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:35,133
ORION: Okay.

1276
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:38,653
MARISHA: Maybe give it to Scanlan. Scanlan, do you
have anything in your head slot?

1277
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:44,182
SAM: "Just my cunning wit!" I don't even know what
a head slot is.

1278
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:45,773
LAURA: It's where a hat goes.

1279
01:17:45,773 --> 01:17:49,406
ORION: Then for the time being, I take off the
Ioun Stone and I (fzzt) dissipate it and...

1280
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:50,981
put it on.

1281
01:17:50,981 --> 01:17:51,852
MATT: Okay.

1282
01:17:51,852 --> 01:17:52,984
SAM: Oh, can you share?

1283
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:54,442
ORION: This essentially allows me to--

1284
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:55,682
MATT: Anyone who wears it.

1285
01:17:55,682 --> 01:18:01,353
ORION: (stammering) Anyone who wears it can
maintain two concentration spells for two rounds.

1286
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:03,116
LAURA: Oh, that's great for you.

1287
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:06,208
MATT: It's great for a lot of people.

1288
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:10,659
TRAVIS: Could you do that cheer where I feel a lot
better after you do it?

1289
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:13,508
MATT: Pike comes up and says, "I'm sorry! I'm
sorry, Grog," goes over and places

1290
01:18:13,508 --> 01:18:16,112
her hands upon you.

1291
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:22,088
As she's about to, Kima pushes her aside, and
says, "I've got this." Walks up, and you can see

1292
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:27,720
this divine glowing energy. It fills her hands.
She reaches out and touches you and this warmth

1293
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:36,375
fills-- this warmth fills your torso. Using her
Lay On Hands ability, Lady Kima of Vord heals you

1294
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:39,974
for 38 points of damage.

1295
01:18:39,974 --> 01:18:47,163
LAURA: Did I find anything on the other people?

1296
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:48,944
TRAVIS: Thank you, Kima.

1297
01:18:48,944 --> 01:18:52,864
MATT: You look through the bodies. It looks like
most of their adornments, other than the natural

1298
01:18:52,864 --> 01:18:57,380
armor and weapons they have, nothing of particular
interest. Make an investigation check.

1299
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:06,945
LAURA: Oh, wait, I get to go twice because it's
Underdark. That was great. 16.

1300
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:13,201
MATT: Okay. 16? Yeah, you're not able to really
pull anything from their bodies, unfortunately.

1301
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:19,196
However, after Kima finishes healing you, Kima
walks over to the dwarf corpse as you're

1302
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:25,230
inspecting it and gives it a look-over and shakes
her head.

1303
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,026
LAURA: What do you see, Kima?

1304
01:19:27,026 --> 01:19:31,469
MATT: (sighs) "This was one of my companions."

1305
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:34,075
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, no.

1306
01:19:34,075 --> 01:19:37,989
MATT: "Well, judging by the scars across his body,
he had already been made a thrall of one of the

1307
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,703
"illithid. Most likely the one that we finished
back there."

1308
01:19:41,703 --> 01:19:43,538
SAM: Killed her friend?

1309
01:19:43,538 --> 01:19:45,031
LAURA: He was already a thrall.

1310
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:46,678
MATT: "There wasn't much to really bring him back
at this point, I fear."

1311
01:19:46,678 --> 01:19:48,972
LAURA: Is that what they would've done to Grog?

1312
01:19:48,972 --> 01:19:52,743
MATT: And as you guys all look at Grog now, you
can see him, he has hundreds upon hundreds of

1313
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:59,609
small scars across his body: fresh wounds that
have just barely sealed. It looks like they've

1314
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:02,698
done a number on him with a bunch of small blades,
hooks, razors-- it's hard to tell. But he is

1315
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:05,341
coated with small cuts.

1316
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:06,843
TRAVIS: It's been interesting.

1317
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:08,617
LAURA: You look really manly now.

1318
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:10,390
TRAVIS: Now?

1319
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:16,503
MARISHA: (laughs) Have we done some healing? Has
healing been done?

1320
01:20:16,503 --> 01:20:19,198
MATT: You guys can short rest if you want to heal
yourselves with your hit dice.

1321
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,268
LIAM: This is the time for an intermission.

1322
01:20:23,268 --> 01:20:24,483
LAURA: Oh, it is?

1323
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:25,900
LIAM: Yeah.

1324
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,846
MARISHA: Is it? What time is it?

1325
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:28,439
ORION: It's 8:24.

1326
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:31,780
SAM: It's only just begun.

1327
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,577
LIAM: (singing) We've only just begun. (speaking)
Because we went right into battle.

1328
01:20:35,577 --> 01:20:42,240
MARISHA: I wanted to talk to my team. Can we talk
now or talk after break? It's up to you.

1329
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,385
SAM: Let's talk now.

1330
01:20:44,385 --> 01:20:48,528
LIAM: Vax is walking off into the distance to
urinate on a stalagmite or stalactite, whatever's

1331
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:50,049
the one on the ground.

1332
01:20:50,049 --> 01:20:52,460
MARISHA: Well, we'll wait for Vax to get back.

1333
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,896
SAM: We'll bring him up to speed later.

1334
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:55,991
TRAVIS: Just talk loudly.

1335
01:20:55,991 --> 01:20:58,307
MARISHA: Well, I don't-- Where's Kima?

1336
01:20:58,307 --> 01:20:59,953
LAURA: She's right here.

1337
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:02,946
MATT: Kima's with you. Kima's still looking over
the body of the dwarf that's fallen.

1338
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:04,145
TRAVIS: Speak!

1339
01:21:04,145 --> 01:21:07,741
LIAM: Oh, that's a relief! Oh!

1340
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:10,022
LAURA: (whispering) Do you not want to talk in
front of Kima?

1341
01:21:10,022 --> 01:21:14,942
MARISHA: (whispering) I don't want to talk in
front of Kima. (speaking) Kima? Earmuffs, Kima.

1342
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:17,110
LAURA: No, that's awkward.

1343
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,599
TRAVIS: You want me to distract her?

1344
01:21:18,599 --> 01:21:20,297
LIAM: It's the longest pee ever.

1345
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:23,164
TRAVIS: I'll distract her! I'll distract Kima.

1346
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:24,733
LAURA: Grog goes and distracts Kima.

1347
01:21:24,733 --> 01:21:35,107
SAM: I might be better at that. Kima, can you take
a walk with me? I would like to persuade you to

1348
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:37,529
take a walk with me.

1349
01:21:38,382 --> 01:21:40,811
MATT: Go ahead and roll persuasion.

1350
01:21:40,811 --> 01:21:45,888
SAM: 24.

1351
01:21:45,888 --> 01:21:49,643
MATT: Okay. Kima gives you a concerned look and
goes--

1352
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:53,493
SAM: There's this thing on my body. I thought
maybe you could take a look at it and you could

1353
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:56,103
tell me if it's good or bad? I don't know.

1354
01:21:56,103 --> 01:21:57,894
MATT: "Oh dear. No, please."

1355
01:21:57,894 --> 01:21:59,600
TRAVIS: Scanlan, do not drop the mack.

1356
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,011
MATT: And the two of you begin to walk away for a
moment, away from the party. Briefly, while the

1357
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:07,006
rest of you are left behind.

1358
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,807
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you have an earring?

1359
01:22:08,807 --> 01:22:09,920
SAM: I have an earring.

1360
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,952
MARISHA: Okay, so Scanlan can hear.

1361
01:22:11,952 --> 01:22:19,493
SAM: I use my Minor Illusion to create a purple
third nipple on me that I show her and ask her if

1362
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:21,606
it's okay, or if it's--

1363
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:23,788
MATT: Okay, things are getting a little weird.

1364
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:30,899
SAM: Is this normal?

1365
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:34,599
MATT: "None of this is normal. At all."

1366
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:39,127
SAM: It's just, I trust you. I feel like I know
you. You know we had that thing back there and

1367
01:22:39,127 --> 01:22:43,603
then Keyleth was yelling at you. What was that all
about?

1368
01:22:43,603 --> 01:22:44,919
MATT: "We're all under duress."

1369
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:46,347
SAM: Let's girl talk.

1370
01:22:46,347 --> 01:22:49,872
MATT: "We're under a lot of duress. The more and
more things-- people have emotions and I

1371
01:22:49,872 --> 01:22:53,953
"understand that. It's all right." And she pulls
the leather gloves off that are part of the full

1372
01:22:53,953 --> 01:22:57,675
leather armor set and begins to inspect you. In
the meantime, you guys can continue your

1373
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,943
discussion.

1374
01:22:58,943 --> 01:23:01,054
MARISHA: I think we should get out of here.

1375
01:23:01,054 --> 01:23:02,657
LAURA: What? Why?

1376
01:23:02,657 --> 01:23:10,878
MARISHA: Well, we've got Grog. We've got Kima. We
came here to find Kima. That was our mission. I

1377
01:23:10,878 --> 01:23:13,455
don't trust her.

1378
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:15,585
LAURA: We found her, but we can't leave without
her.

1379
01:23:15,585 --> 01:23:20,951
LIAM: So I'm walking back from my pee and I've
overheard this. "We were sent here to bring back Kima."

1380
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:22,898
LAURA: And now you want to abandon her?

1381
01:23:22,898 --> 01:23:26,193
LIAM: She's not going to come with us until we've
killed this K'Varn.

1382
01:23:26,193 --> 01:23:29,104
LAURA: Keyleth, what's your problem with Kima?

1383
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:34,492
MARISHA: Well, look. She's been... She just gave
me the wrong vibe, up front.

1384
01:23:34,492 --> 01:23:36,234
LAURA: Okay, vibe. What did she do?

1385
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:37,876
MARISHA: She's been very rude--

1386
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:41,284
LAURA: She's been very tortured. Tortured,
Keyleth.

1387
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:48,098
MARISHA: Right. But look what happened. She's
brought countless people down here, only to meet

1388
01:23:48,098 --> 01:23:49,704
their end.

1389
01:23:49,704 --> 01:23:51,193
ORION: Well, none of those people are us.

1390
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,308
MARISHA: Right.

1391
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:55,955
LAURA: They're dead because they got captured.
We're stronger.

1392
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:59,113
LIAM: Do you know something we don't, Keyleth?

1393
01:23:59,113 --> 01:24:09,343
MARISHA: Look, all I know is that only a fool
believes that his path is the most virtuous. See?

1394
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:11,080
And he's got an intelligence of six.

1395
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,564
LIAM: I want to use my-- I would like to do a
check on Keyleth.

1396
01:24:13,564 --> 01:24:14,661
MATT: Okay.

1397
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:16,461
LIAM: I want to see her intentions.

1398
01:24:16,461 --> 01:24:20,087
TRAVIS: (squealing) Ooh, inside-the-group check! I
love it!

1399
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:21,828
LIAM: It's a 14.

1400
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:24,068
MATT: A 14. All right.

1401
01:24:24,068 --> 01:24:29,807
LAURA: (laughing) Sneaky, sneaky Keyleth.

1402
01:24:29,807 --> 01:24:32,779
TRAVIS: The whisper! The first whisper!

1403
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:36,028
SAM: Get on camera. Get on camera. Over here, over
here.

1404
01:24:36,028 --> 01:24:42,651
TRAVIS: Whisper on camera. He used to do this all
the time. When shit goes down and all of us can't

1405
01:24:42,651 --> 01:24:47,202
know, he whispers. And he sticks his tongue in
your ear a little bit.

1406
01:24:48,056 --> 01:24:49,605
ORION: It's really nice.

1407
01:24:49,605 --> 01:24:53,327
LAURA: I can't cheat, but I really want to
listen.

1408
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:56,363
TRAVIS: What was that shit about now I'm manly?

1409
01:24:56,363 --> 01:24:58,077
LAURA: You are manly. I meant more manly.

1410
01:24:58,077 --> 01:25:05,129
SAM: Hey everyone, buy a t-shirt! Subscribe to
Geek & Sundry. Support Felicia Day.

1411
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:09,088
MATT: As you finish your statement as well,
Keyleth, Clarota steps up and says, "I

1412
01:25:09,088 --> 01:25:18,534
"wholeheartedly agree. She is unstable and cannot
be trusted in her state."

1413
01:25:18,534 --> 01:25:21,960
LIAM: Hold on a second, that's unfair.

1414
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,584
MARISHA: Why?

1415
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:35,345
LIAM: It has been a long road. Keyleth, I know you
have had a hard time. We all have. I know we're

1416
01:25:35,345 --> 01:25:44,836
miles below the surface of the world. But we're
together. We are family. And everyone here is here

1417
01:25:44,836 --> 01:25:55,002
for you as you have been for us. Now, I say we
camp for the night inside this schmuck's tent. We

1418
01:25:55,002 --> 01:26:01,613
stay here, we rest up, sleep on it, and see how
we're all feeling in the morning. We're here for

1419
01:26:01,613 --> 01:26:09,895
you, Keyleth, and we'll protect you as you have
protected us. You've got a family with us.

1420
01:26:09,895 --> 01:26:15,515
MARISHA: (crying) How do we know we are doing the
right thing? We've killed a lot of people, you

1421
01:26:15,515 --> 01:26:19,006
guys. We've killed a lot of people.

1422
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:26,098
LIAM: Who in this world is without fault? Who
hasn't made mistakes? We certainly all have.

1423
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:31,569
LAURA: Keyleth, we're keeping him, K'Varn, from
killing even more.

1424
01:26:31,569 --> 01:26:38,384
MARISHA: How do we know we're not just interfering
with issues that aren't our own? We didn't know

1425
01:26:38,384 --> 01:26:44,494
any of this until we came down here, and look she
wants to take the horn. She wants the horn, and

1426
01:26:44,494 --> 01:26:46,567
she wants to take it back herself.

1427
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:51,104
LIAM: The bottom line is, all of this insanity is
going to bubble up to the surface if someone

1428
01:26:51,104 --> 01:26:52,927
doesn't stop it.

1429
01:26:52,927 --> 01:26:54,884
LAURA: All those creatures that have been coming
up, Keyleth?

1430
01:26:54,884 --> 01:27:00,950
LIAM: Remember, think back. It has already begun,
and no one is here to stop it except for Vox

1431
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,835
Machina. Us.

1432
01:27:03,835 --> 01:27:08,827
TALIESIN: We promise, we will heed your warning,
but we can't run. We will heed it, though.

1433
01:27:08,827 --> 01:27:10,280
LIAM: We've got your back.

1434
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,602
MATT: "We made a deal."

1435
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,059
TALIESIN: And we made a deal.

1436
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:15,627
LAURA: We did make a deal.

1437
01:27:15,627 --> 01:27:24,464
MARISHA: I understand you, Clarota, and I'm on
your side. I swear. But a lot of people-- there

1438
01:27:24,464 --> 01:27:32,029
have been a lot of murderers who said they did the
things that they did because their gods told them

1439
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:36,238
to do it. Right?

1440
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:38,625
TALIESIN: We'll be cautious, and we'll have you to
protect us.

1441
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:45,177
ORION: I dissipate invisible, and I approach
Keyleth. "Your Highness. By the honor of all

1442
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:55,236
"Stormwinds, I will let nothing happen to you. I
swear it. I will fight until my death, and I have

1443
01:27:55,236 --> 01:28:05,377
"ways, of course, to get us all out of here
whenever I damn well please. Do not worry."

1444
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:11,938
MARISHA: I just have a bad feeling. This horn
can't make it back up to the surface. You guys

1445
01:28:11,938 --> 01:28:14,040
have to promise me that.

1446
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,157
LAURA: We'll keep the horn from leaving.

1447
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:19,994
MARISHA: She wants to take it back. Why? If it's
that bad, why does she want it?

1448
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:29,422
LIAM: That may be so, but the evil that is brewing
beneath the surface of the world will stretch up

1449
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:36,017
to everything we know. And I know that you have
made mistakes. I have certainly made mistakes.

1450
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:45,783
That is to live. There is more at stake right now,
and we are the front line. We're the only ones who

1451
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:50,192
can stop it. Mistakes are all right.

1452
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:54,226
TALIESIN: The god in darkness will blot out the
light.

1453
01:28:54,226 --> 01:28:56,074
MARISHA: I just hope we're not the darkness.

1454
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:57,869
ORION: Oh, do you need light? (fwoosh)

1455
01:28:57,869 --> 01:28:59,610
MARISHA: Oh, god.

1456
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,191
ORION Oh, is that-- I'm sorry

1457
01:29:01,326 --> 01:29:02,356
LAURA: Thanks, Tiberius.

1458
01:29:02,356 --> 01:29:07,066
MATT: "I'm not sure what this is. I'm sorry."

1459
01:29:07,066 --> 01:29:13,563
SAM: "There's one more thing I need you to look
at, it's just..." I cast Polymorph on myself, giving

1460
01:29:13,563 --> 01:29:19,561
myself a gigantic dick, and I slowly pull down my
pants...

1461
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:25,128
MATT: Kima immediately turns around and says,
"Okay!" And walks back to the group.

1462
01:29:25,128 --> 01:29:33,797
TRAVIS: What did I say? You can't keep it in for
two seconds. Not that I blame you! My god!

1463
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:39,470
LIAM: I think we are all a little frayed. I think
we need to rest. Let's set up camp.

1464
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,348
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's camp.

1465
01:29:41,348 --> 01:29:46,751
MATT: Kima steps in at this point and says, "I
agree. (sigh) We have quite a journey ahead of us."

1466
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:58,311
At which point, Clarota pipes up and says,
"Indeed. We're not too far from Yug'Voril. Let us rest."

1467
01:29:58,311 --> 01:30:06,466
MARISHA: Kima. I... just wanted to apologize.

1468
01:30:06,466 --> 01:30:10,736
MATT: "What for?"

1469
01:30:10,736 --> 01:30:15,797
MARISHA: I came across too harshly that night.

1470
01:30:15,797 --> 01:30:25,808
MATT: She puts her hand up and... in a matronly
way. "It's honestly not a worry. War is stressful,

1471
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:30,224
"and all of us have been through a lot for this
experience. I understand. I've been where you've

1472
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:34,400
"been, and it's not uncommon to question everything
around you, and with good reason: that's what

1473
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,231
"keeps you alive. Were you to believe every person
that crossed your path, you would not have made it

1474
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:53,164
"past your 15th season. I can assure you, as best
as I can, that I mean the best for all of us. I

1475
01:30:53,164 --> 01:31:00,925
"just know that if we don't do what we're here to
do, far more people will suffer than the few I've

1476
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:09,398
"brought down here to protect me and for me to
protect. I'm not asking for your trust. I'm just

1477
01:31:09,398 --> 01:31:12,600
"asking for your patience."

1478
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:21,596
MARISHA: Well, I can grant you that. Only if you
promise to grant us respect in return, because I

1479
01:31:21,596 --> 01:31:27,702
feel you were a little untrusting of what we were
doing up front, which I once again understand.

1480
01:31:27,702 --> 01:31:30,867
MATT: "You caught me at a rough time."

1481
01:31:30,867 --> 01:31:32,901
MARISHA: Same here.

1482
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:35,314
MATT: "Well, thank you."

1483
01:31:35,314 --> 01:31:38,440
LIAM: I'm sorry, Scanlan, what is that?

1484
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,520
SAM: Oh, this bulge down here?

1485
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,168
MATT: "That's bedtime is what that is. All right,
everyone, let's go ahead and find ourselves a rest."

1486
01:31:45,168 --> 01:31:48,236
All right. So as everyone goes to camp for
the evening we are going to go ahead and take a

1487
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,782
break. Potty break for folks. We'll be back here
in about ten or so minutes.

1488
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:57,557
TRAVIS: Could you un-Polymorph your tripod, for
god's sake?

1489
01:31:57,557 --> 01:31:59,733
ORION: Before we go to sleep, I cast a bunch of
spells in stuff.

1490
01:31:59,733 --> 01:32:06,301
MATT: All right, guys. Awesome See you in a little
bit.

1491
01:32:07,662 --> 01:33:09,195
[dramatic music]

1492
01:33:15,297 --> 01:33:20,768
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

1493
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:26,849
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

1494
01:33:26,849 --> 01:33:32,723
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

1495
01:33:32,723 --> 01:33:37,848
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

1496
01:33:37,983 --> 01:33:43,827
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

1497
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:49,501
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

1498
01:33:49,501 --> 01:33:52,724
life of service and devotion.

1499
01:33:52,724 --> 01:33:58,996
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

1500
01:33:58,996 --> 01:34:05,168
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

1501
01:34:05,168 --> 01:34:08,738
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

1502
01:34:08,738 --> 01:34:15,277
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

1503
01:34:15,277 --> 01:34:20,495
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

1504
01:34:20,495 --> 01:34:27,946
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

1505
01:34:27,946 --> 01:34:34,229
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to

1506
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:35,779
life.

1507
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:42,869
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends,

1508
01:34:42,869 --> 01:34:49,862
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

1509
01:34:49,862 --> 01:34:56,418
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

1510
01:34:56,418 --> 01:35:01,708
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

1511
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:07,122
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

1512
01:35:07,122 --> 01:35:09,586
called the Broken Howl.

1513
01:35:09,586 --> 01:35:16,204
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her
morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is

1514
01:35:16,204 --> 01:35:17,703
ready.

1515
01:35:18,955 --> 01:35:27,111
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

1516
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:34,486
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

1517
01:35:34,486 --> 01:35:38,613
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

1518
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:40,478
(record scratch) Wait.

1519
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:47,241
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

1520
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,568
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

1521
01:35:50,568 --> 01:35:52,167
Also ale.

1522
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:58,509
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

1523
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:04,647
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

1524
01:36:04,647 --> 01:36:06,088
gnome--

1525
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:07,459
[music]

1526
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:15,346
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

1527
01:36:15,346 --> 01:36:22,628
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

1528
01:36:22,628 --> 01:36:26,798
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

1529
01:36:26,798 --> 01:36:28,464
(record scratch) Wait.

1530
01:36:28,464 --> 01:36:35,586
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

1531
01:36:35,586 --> 01:36:38,562
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

1532
01:36:38,562 --> 01:36:40,390
Also ale.

1533
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:46,648
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

1534
01:36:46,648 --> 01:36:53,129
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

1535
01:36:53,129 --> 01:37:01,291
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

1536
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:09,136
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience cost him

1537
01:37:09,136 --> 01:37:10,593
dearly.

1538
01:37:10,593 --> 01:37:18,403
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

1539
01:37:18,403 --> 01:37:25,206
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

1540
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:33,089
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

1541
01:37:33,089 --> 01:37:38,379
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

1542
01:37:38,379 --> 01:37:45,845
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

1543
01:37:45,845 --> 01:37:51,591
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

1544
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:53,486
Also ale!

1545
01:37:54,604 --> 01:37:58,738
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

1546
01:37:58,738 --> 01:38:03,483
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

1547
01:38:03,483 --> 01:38:05,269
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

1548
01:38:05,269 --> 01:38:12,119
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

1549
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:18,090
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

1550
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:23,335
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

1551
01:38:23,335 --> 01:38:29,433
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

1552
01:38:29,433 --> 01:38:35,337
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

1553
01:38:35,337 --> 01:38:39,950
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

1554
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:45,046
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

1555
01:38:45,046 --> 01:38:52,485
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

1556
01:38:52,485 --> 01:38:58,206
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

1557
01:38:58,206 --> 01:39:03,307
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

1558
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:09,514
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

1559
01:39:09,514 --> 01:39:15,682
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

1560
01:39:15,682 --> 01:39:21,276
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

1561
01:39:21,277 --> 01:39:28,057
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

1562
01:39:28,057 --> 01:39:34,207
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

1563
01:39:34,207 --> 01:39:36,042
will ever return.

1564
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:41,340
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

1565
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:47,346
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

1566
01:39:47,346 --> 01:39:56,096
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

1567
01:39:58,629 --> 01:40:03,145
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

1568
01:40:03,145 --> 01:40:09,146
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

1569
01:40:09,146 --> 01:40:13,585
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

1570
01:40:13,585 --> 01:40:20,294
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

1571
01:40:20,294 --> 01:40:26,109
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

1572
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:28,295
would stand in their way.

1573
01:40:28,295 --> 01:40:33,625
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

1574
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:39,915
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

1575
01:40:39,915 --> 01:40:46,264
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

1576
01:40:46,264 --> 01:40:51,921
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

1577
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:56,137
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

1578
01:40:56,137 --> 01:41:02,850
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

1579
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:10,444
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

1580
01:41:12,222 --> 01:41:17,589
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

1581
01:41:17,589 --> 01:41:18,889
eye on you.

1582
01:41:18,889 --> 01:41:24,417
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

1583
01:41:24,417 --> 01:41:28,397
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

1584
01:41:28,397 --> 01:41:34,343
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

1585
01:41:34,343 --> 01:41:39,899
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

1586
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:45,682
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

1587
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,973
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

1588
01:41:48,973 --> 01:41:53,497
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

1589
01:41:53,497 --> 01:41:59,220
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

1590
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:05,524
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

1591
01:42:05,524 --> 01:42:09,388
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

1592
01:42:09,388 --> 01:42:16,743
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

1593
01:42:16,743 --> 01:42:22,265
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

1594
01:42:22,265 --> 01:42:23,973
gnome, Pike.

1595
01:42:23,973 --> 01:42:29,422
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

1596
01:42:29,422 --> 01:42:32,297
and makes the females swoon.

1597
01:42:33,841 --> 01:42:40,884
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

1598
01:42:40,884 --> 01:42:43,664
located in the heart of Draconia.

1599
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:48,917
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

1600
01:42:48,917 --> 01:42:53,797
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

1601
01:42:53,797 --> 01:42:59,201
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

1602
01:42:59,201 --> 01:43:04,497
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

1603
01:43:04,497 --> 01:43:08,923
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

1604
01:43:08,923 --> 01:43:14,980
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

1605
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:20,040
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

1606
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:23,403
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

1607
01:43:23,403 --> 01:43:28,264
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

1608
01:43:28,264 --> 01:43:32,766
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

1609
01:43:32,766 --> 01:43:38,742
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

1610
01:43:38,742 --> 01:43:41,778
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

1611
01:43:41,778 --> 01:43:46,430
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

1612
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:51,101
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

1613
01:43:51,101 --> 01:43:56,445
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

1614
01:43:56,445 --> 01:44:02,544
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

1615
01:44:02,544 --> 01:44:07,278
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

1616
01:44:07,278 --> 01:44:13,268
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

1617
01:44:13,268 --> 01:44:19,082
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

1618
01:44:19,082 --> 01:44:26,462
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

1619
01:44:26,462 --> 01:44:30,744
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

1620
01:44:32,941 --> 01:44:37,970
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

1621
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:43,109
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

1622
01:44:43,109 --> 01:44:49,636
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

1623
01:44:49,636 --> 01:44:55,141
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

1624
01:44:55,141 --> 01:45:00,755
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

1625
01:45:00,755 --> 01:45:06,829
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

1626
01:45:06,829 --> 01:45:08,569
on the open road.

1627
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:14,015
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

1628
01:45:14,015 --> 01:45:20,173
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

1629
01:45:20,173 --> 01:45:26,626
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

1630
01:45:26,626 --> 01:45:36,619
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

1631
01:45:36,619 --> 01:45:40,312
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

1632
01:45:40,312 --> 01:45:47,802
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

1633
01:45:47,802 --> 01:45:54,323
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

1634
01:45:54,323 --> 01:45:59,793
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than makes up the

1635
01:45:59,793 --> 01:46:01,852
difference.

1636
01:46:02,274 --> 01:46:06,852
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

1637
01:46:06,998 --> 01:46:14,082
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

1638
01:46:14,261 --> 01:46:19,333
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

1639
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:25,822
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each

1640
01:46:25,822 --> 01:46:27,168
other.

1641
01:46:27,168 --> 01:46:32,171
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

1642
01:46:32,171 --> 01:46:39,079
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

1643
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:45,809
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

1644
01:46:45,809 --> 01:46:49,633
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

1645
01:46:49,633 --> 01:46:57,697
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

1646
01:46:57,697 --> 01:47:01,058
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

1647
01:47:01,058 --> 01:47:08,509
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

1648
01:47:08,509 --> 01:47:15,165
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

1649
01:47:15,165 --> 01:47:20,047
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

1650
01:47:20,047 --> 01:47:25,072
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

1651
01:47:26,319 --> 01:48:28,302
[dramatic music]

1652
01:48:33,072 --> 01:48:38,714
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. We've been
sufficiently rested. First, we're going to say

1653
01:48:38,714 --> 01:48:42,732
thank you and welcome to all our new viewers.
Welcome to Critical Role and all of its chaos: A

1654
01:48:42,732 --> 01:48:45,263
bunch of voice actors playing Dungeons & Dragons.

1655
01:48:45,263 --> 01:48:52,857
I also want to congratulate the first winner of
our TableTop promo kit this evening, Zargross won.

1656
01:48:52,857 --> 01:49:00,570
Well done. We'll be giving out another one at
2,750. So 2,750 subscribers and someone else in

1657
01:49:00,584 --> 01:49:03,050
the chat room will win another promo kit. So
that's cool.

1658
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:06,334
LIAM: We will be here every week, so subscribe.

1659
01:49:06,377 --> 01:49:10,830
MATT: Also, t-shirts on sale, as of today. They
are a limited run for two weeks. We are trying to

1660
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:16,102
get to our goal of 1,000 before that's done,
hopefully. So you can just scroll down to the

1661
01:49:16,102 --> 01:49:19,732
bottom of the Twitch page; you'll find a button
there that will get you to that shop.

1662
01:49:19,732 --> 01:49:22,402
So go for it!

1663
01:49:22,402 --> 01:49:29,607
MARISHA: Wait! Also, the PayPal is working again,
for donations.

1664
01:49:29,607 --> 01:49:32,908
MATT: All right, so the 826 donation's working
again. Yay!

1665
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:42,036
Let us begin. So after an evening's rest, taking
your respective turns keeping watch, all of you

1666
01:49:42,036 --> 01:49:49,333
come to consciousness once more. Clarota anxiously
sits at the edge of the camping facility, looking

1667
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:53,770
deeper into the tunnel ahead, keeping his eyes
peeled in the darkness.

1668
01:49:53,977 --> 01:49:59,567
SAM: I check under my belt because the spell has
worn off. And I'm back down to my normal one and a

1669
01:49:59,567 --> 01:50:05,435
half inches. Which on a gnome is pretty big.

1670
01:50:05,435 --> 01:50:11,484
LAURA: Thank you.

1671
01:50:11,484 --> 01:50:13,703
SAM: Length! And girth.

1672
01:50:13,703 --> 01:50:15,230
LAURA: Oh god, what?

1673
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:17,563
SAM: It's like a square. Like a cube.

1674
01:50:17,563 --> 01:50:27,859
MATT: Anyway, you guys eventually come to
consciousness and finish cooking whatever bits of

1675
01:50:27,859 --> 01:50:32,065
food you've managed to muster at this point in
time in the Underdark.

1676
01:50:32,065 --> 01:50:34,237
LAURA: It's doughnuts.

1677
01:50:34,237 --> 01:50:36,392
MATT: Yeah, it is doughnuts. Under-doughnuts.

1678
01:50:36,392 --> 01:50:38,067
MARISHA: And Indian food, apparently.

1679
01:50:38,067 --> 01:50:39,290
TALIESIN: Under-Indian.

1680
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:41,559
MATT: By the way, all of those who contributed to
getting us food tonight, thank you so much.

1681
01:50:41,559 --> 01:50:42,770
ALL: Thank you!

1682
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:53,786
MATT: Clarota seems slightly impatient as everyone
is waking up and goes, "Come! Ahead, we shall find

1683
01:50:53,827 --> 01:50:56,725
"it's Yug'Voril."

1684
01:50:56,725 --> 01:50:58,281
LAURA: That's your city?

1685
01:50:58,281 --> 01:51:01,072
MATT: "Beautiful city of secrets."

1686
01:51:01,072 --> 01:51:07,307
LAURA: I thought your people had thrown you out.
Why so eager to get back?

1687
01:51:07,307 --> 01:51:19,681
MATT: "Without the colony, I serve no purpose. I
am wandering, aimless. I wish to return to the

1688
01:51:19,681 --> 01:51:21,780
"Elder Brain."

1689
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:29,347
LIAM: And to be fair, he was only thrown out once
K'Varn took over the Elder Brain. Correct?

1690
01:51:29,347 --> 01:51:40,258
MATT: "No. They threw me out long before, for my
gift." And you see a little spark of arcane blue

1691
01:51:40,353 --> 01:51:49,375
filter out of his fingers in the air and then
(poof). Small spark. "It is an abomination to my

1692
01:51:49,375 --> 01:52:03,269
"people. I am considered anathema. But to save
them! To save my city, then they shall have me

1693
01:52:03,269 --> 01:52:05,945
"back a hero."

1694
01:52:05,945 --> 01:52:08,121
LAURA: And if they don't?

1695
01:52:08,121 --> 01:52:13,035
MATT: "They will. I can sense it."

1696
01:52:13,035 --> 01:52:17,426
ORION: Well, yes, it makes perfect sense, Clarota.
I would think they would grant you a hero's

1697
01:52:17,426 --> 01:52:19,641
welcome, as well.

1698
01:52:19,641 --> 01:52:23,179
LAURA: If not, you have a home with us.

1699
01:52:23,179 --> 01:52:34,847
MATT: "Thank you. Forward, we will find shrouded
in the forest of fungus our destination. Come." It

1700
01:52:34,847 --> 01:52:38,733
begins to drift down into the dark tunnel further
below.

1701
01:52:38,733 --> 01:52:39,882
TALIESIN: We follow.

1702
01:52:39,882 --> 01:52:41,094
TRAVIS: Yeah, we follow.

1703
01:52:41,094 --> 01:52:45,255
ORION: I follow behind them and call out to him,
"Are you using Levitation, or what? How are you--

1704
01:52:45,255 --> 01:52:46,973
"is this how you--"

1705
01:52:46,973 --> 01:52:52,177
MATT: "It's how we get around, dragonborn."

1706
01:52:52,177 --> 01:52:53,731
ORION: Oh, okay.

1707
01:52:53,731 --> 01:53:01,030
MATT: His tentacles flicker at his face for a
second. As you guys continue forward in silence,

1708
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:08,023
K'Varn seems to be more chatty than usual, almost
like the proximity is-- this is excitement to him,

1709
01:53:08,023 --> 01:53:09,543
instinctually.

1710
01:53:09,543 --> 01:53:13,476
MARISHA: Did you mean Clarota? You said K'Varn.

1711
01:53:13,476 --> 01:53:14,599
MATT: I meant Clarota.

1712
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:15,526
LIAM: Slip of the tongue!

1713
01:53:15,526 --> 01:53:16,637
TRAVIS: I was like, "oh shit."

1714
01:53:16,637 --> 01:53:20,057
LAURA: See, he slipped-of-the-tongue before and he
screwed us over with a sneaky-sneaky!

1715
01:53:20,057 --> 01:53:31,989
MATT: It's been a long week. I know. Sorry. As
Clarota drifts, "Our people, we are a structured

1716
01:53:31,989 --> 01:53:42,833
"society. Together we provide for each other.
Broken into creeds, we function rather

1717
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:52,951
"pleasantly." And he drifts forward again at full
pace.

1718
01:53:52,951 --> 01:54:02,388
LAURA: Clarota seems pretty excited to get home.
I'm worried for him.

1719
01:54:02,388 --> 01:54:04,249
LIAM: Worried for him?

1720
01:54:04,249 --> 01:54:05,262
LAURA: Yes.

1721
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:07,559
LIAM: What, for his effect on the group?

1722
01:54:07,559 --> 01:54:11,287
LAURA: I'm worried that they won't take him back,
what that will do to his state.

1723
01:54:11,287 --> 01:54:18,550
LIAM: Well, the bottom line is, (sighs) we have a
pretty clear goal at hand. Everything else will

1724
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,550
have to be figured out afterward.

1725
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:24,288
ORION: I still follow Clarota. I'm like, "So is
it-- do you do it with your mind, or is it just

1726
01:54:24,288 --> 01:54:28,442
"like-- were you all taught as a child to be able
to levitate, because it seems--"

1727
01:54:28,442 --> 01:54:36,150
MATT: "It's inherent, much like your gifts. It's
just how we get around."

1728
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:39,261
ORION: Good to know. Understood.

1729
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:43,490
TALIESIN: K'Varn, the god in darkness. I want to
wrack my brain to think if I've ever had any

1730
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:48,849
lessons or if that name has ever come up in any of
my reading.

1731
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:53,846
MATT: All right. It'd be a history check. Like a
super-super history check.

1732
01:54:53,846 --> 01:54:55,699
TALIESIN: History check?

1733
01:54:55,699 --> 01:54:58,178
LIAM: A super history check.

1734
01:54:58,178 --> 01:55:01,486
TALIESIN: No whammies. That's a 13.

1735
01:55:01,486 --> 01:55:05,828
MATT: 13? The name is as fresh to you as it was
the day you heard it.

1736
01:55:05,828 --> 01:55:07,426
TALIESIN: Oh, fiddlesticks.

1737
01:55:07,426 --> 01:55:12,470
TRAVIS: I walk over to Lady Kima and I say,
"How's that that greatsword been treating you?"

1738
01:55:12,517 --> 01:55:18,597
MATT: She walks and she's using it almost like a
stick in the dirt as she takes a step. "You know,

1739
01:55:18,597 --> 01:55:29,394
"it's served its purpose so far, I just (sighs) I
wish... I wish that vault wasn't lost. Leather isn't

1740
01:55:29,394 --> 01:55:32,635
"my idea of defensive."

1741
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:40,141
LAURA: Would you fancy a trade, Kima? I have elven
chainmail, if that would help you.

1742
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:41,299
MATT: "Perhaps?"

1743
01:55:41,299 --> 01:55:44,537
LAURA: I could take that leather armor off your
hands?

1744
01:55:44,537 --> 01:55:47,149
SAM: But you'll be vulnerable, won't you?

1745
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:49,223
LAURA: No, actually. The chainmail isn't right for
me.

1746
01:55:49,223 --> 01:55:52,839
MATT: "Certainly."

1747
01:55:52,839 --> 01:55:56,916
(laughs) She looks to you, specifically.
(laughs)

1748
01:55:56,916 --> 01:56:00,072
LAURA: (laughs) Stick figure... (laughs)

1749
01:56:00,072 --> 01:56:01,133
ORION: Stick figure!

1750
01:56:01,133 --> 01:56:05,069
(all laugh)

1751
01:56:05,069 --> 01:56:12,298
TRAVIS: Got it! Got it. We're good.

1752
01:56:12,298 --> 01:56:17,091
MATT: "Perhaps we'll find a more modest place to
swap, but yes, I agree."

1753
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,541
LAURA: Dang it, I should've done that before we--

1754
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:25,561
SAM: I can make you a modest spot to change?

1755
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:28,427
LIAM: Grog, are you skinning a boar over there?
What are you doing?

1756
01:56:28,427 --> 01:56:30,469
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what they call it in some
countries.

1757
01:56:30,469 --> 01:56:31,740
(all laugh)

1758
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:33,923
MATT: Some of you summon the stapler straw.

1759
01:56:33,923 --> 01:56:36,191
MARISHA: Summon the staples!

1760
01:56:36,191 --> 01:56:45,707
MATT: (laughs) All right, so. As you continue to
press forward deeper into this tunnel network, the

1761
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:51,435
air begins to grow steadily colder and colder. The
temperature, it's-- you begin to see your breath a

1762
01:56:51,435 --> 01:56:53,337
little bit in the air.

1763
01:56:53,337 --> 01:56:56,100
ORION: Am I mistaken? You're really damaged still?

1764
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,770
LIAM: We slept!

1765
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:58,909
MATT: Yeah, you guys all slept overnight.

1766
01:56:58,909 --> 01:56:59,804
TRAVIS: I'm up to full, yeah.

1767
01:56:59,804 --> 01:57:00,824
ORION: So, the scars are...?

1768
01:57:00,824 --> 01:57:02,042
LAURA: The scars are cool!

1769
01:57:02,042 --> 01:57:04,373
MATT: I mean, the visual scars are still there but
he's at full hit points. They're healing slowly.

1770
01:57:04,373 --> 01:57:05,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't you fix these.

1771
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:10,072
ORION: As I notice, I go, "Anybody with (mumbling)
knowledge of medicine should give a whack at

1772
01:57:10,072 --> 01:57:11,915
"cleaning some of those."

1773
01:57:11,915 --> 01:57:20,941
SAM: Oh, you know what, though? Before we go any
further, I remind Pike that Vax's foot damage

1774
01:57:20,941 --> 01:57:23,072
needs daily repair, doesn't it?

1775
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:28,751
MATT: "Oh! Yes, of course!" She comes over and you
guys take a slight break as Pike comes and sets

1776
01:57:28,751 --> 01:57:29,673
you down.

1777
01:57:29,673 --> 01:57:31,177
LIAM: It's not pretty to look at.

1778
01:57:31,177 --> 01:57:32,310
LAURA: She's seen it already, brother.

1779
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:33,426
MATT: "Oh, I've seen worse."

1780
01:57:33,426 --> 01:57:35,066
TRAVIS: Wait, what happened to your foot?

1781
01:57:35,066 --> 01:57:37,732
LAURA: It got melted off. Aw, come on, not again!

1782
01:57:37,732 --> 01:57:44,137
TRAVIS: Oh my god! (laughs) That looks awful.
Really awful.

1783
01:57:44,137 --> 01:57:46,013
LIAM: It's fine, except the pinkie toe

1784
01:57:46,013 --> 01:57:47,502
LAURA: He's got a little pinkie nubbin!

1785
01:57:47,502 --> 01:57:49,307
LIAM: Pinky toe's a nubbin now, yeah

1786
01:57:49,307 --> 01:57:51,631
TRAVIS: You know, we could just take care of the
whole thing right now, if you want.

1787
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:53,038
ORION: No, Grog, that defeats the purpose.

1788
01:57:53,038 --> 01:57:55,196
TRAVIS: No? Rash? ...all right.

1789
01:57:55,196 --> 01:57:57,269
LIAM: I need Percy to make me a replacement first.

1790
01:57:57,269 --> 01:57:59,754
TALIESIN: Make a little metal toe?

1791
01:57:59,754 --> 01:58:02,545
LIAM: Pike, could you hook a brother up?

1792
01:58:02,545 --> 01:58:08,405
MATT: "Certainly." She sets the foot down, she
begins to gather up her runes, and she's casting a

1793
01:58:08,444 --> 01:58:11,774
4th-level spell.

1794
01:58:12,153 --> 01:58:14,043
LAURA: She should've done it before we went to
sleep.

1795
01:58:14,043 --> 01:58:20,159
MATT: Aye, but alas, she's not here. Sorry,
Ashley. So that would be the equivalent of about

1796
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:29,760
32 hit points. She's also going to attempt a
medicine roll, as well. Okay. You notice there is

1797
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:36,521
some progress that is slow, but some of the burn
scarring from the dip in the magma is beginning to

1798
01:58:36,521 --> 01:58:40,368
slowly subside. Fresh skin is beginning to show,
but it's still pretty rough.

1799
01:58:40,368 --> 01:58:43,148
LAURA: It still smells amazing, so if you could
just--

1800
01:58:43,148 --> 01:58:45,607
TRAVIS: It does smell amazing, actually.

1801
01:58:45,607 --> 01:58:48,606
SAM: It's like a weasel on your leg.

1802
01:58:48,606 --> 01:58:52,834
LAURA: Clarota, are we planning on going to your
village before we go see K'Varn, or are we going

1803
01:58:52,834 --> 01:58:55,330
after K'Varn first? I'm confused.

1804
01:58:55,330 --> 01:59:01,151
MATT: "K'Varn resides within the city, the
temple."

1805
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:04,793
LAURA: Oh, is he a mind flayer, then? I mean, is
he like you?

1806
01:59:04,793 --> 01:59:12,438
MATT: "I have not seen him myself, since I was
cast out before he took the star, took my people

1807
01:59:12,438 --> 01:59:13,933
"under his spell."

1808
01:59:13,933 --> 01:59:17,352
TALIESIN: Just to be clear, the temple of what?

1809
01:59:17,352 --> 01:59:25,599
MATT: He leans forward for a second. "The temple.
We don't know its original purpose. The city we

1810
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:36,579
"acquired, we found, we took root. Yug'Voril
existed long before our colony did."

1811
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:44,058
TALIESIN: Okay. That's good to know. That's very
good to know. Thank you.

1812
01:59:44,058 --> 01:59:54,311
MATT: "Very well..." He continues floating forward.
The air, still chilly, with steadily more and more

1813
01:59:54,311 --> 02:00:00,243
moisture. The rock walls become less and less
jagged, growing smoother from endless years of

1814
02:00:00,243 --> 02:00:04,642
condensation, mineral drip, and slow erosion.
Begin to give that smooth inner cave look to the

1815
02:00:04,642 --> 02:00:07,184
outsides of this tunnel.

1816
02:00:07,184 --> 02:00:15,642
LIAM: As we walk, Vax falls in next to Keyleth.
"Keyleth?"

1817
02:00:15,642 --> 02:00:17,812
MARISHA: Yes? What?

1818
02:00:17,812 --> 02:00:19,862
LIAM: We're walking. Are you all right?

1819
02:00:19,862 --> 02:00:21,599
MARISHA: I'm doing okay.

1820
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:22,485
LIAM: You are?

1821
02:00:22,485 --> 02:00:24,675
MARISHA: Yeah. Why?

1822
02:00:24,675 --> 02:00:29,250
LIAM: Everything we said last night was true.
We're here for you.

1823
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,046
MARISHA: I'm here for you, too.

1824
02:00:31,046 --> 02:00:33,972
TALIESIN: We're having a discussion of how best to
go about this.

1825
02:00:33,972 --> 02:00:39,992
LAURA: While that happens, can I use my Primeval
Awareness to sense if I sense any dragons in the

1826
02:00:39,992 --> 02:00:42,149
city coming up in front of us?

1827
02:00:42,149 --> 02:00:49,679
MATT: Certainly. As you're walking, the group
slows with you, as you have to really maintain

1828
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:58,465
concentration on this. You close your eyes and you
consider. You sense no sources of dragon within

1829
02:00:58,465 --> 02:01:03,073
the radial of your ability to sense in this cavern
structure.

1830
02:01:03,073 --> 02:01:05,433
TRAVIS: Are our feet leaving footprints?

1831
02:01:05,433 --> 02:01:06,646
MATT: Subtle ones, but yeah.

1832
02:01:06,646 --> 02:01:09,222
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Dust of Tracelessness
everywhere!

1833
02:01:09,222 --> 02:01:10,957
(all laugh)

1834
02:01:10,957 --> 02:01:12,474
TRAVIS: Good!

1835
02:01:12,474 --> 02:01:13,881
TALIESIN: Missed our little flower girl.

1836
02:01:13,881 --> 02:01:16,840
MARISHA: I know! So glad we have him back.

1837
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:24,110
TALIESIN: I want to just put something out on the
headsets really quickly. "When we get into the

1838
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:31,213
"city, I need everyone to promise that we're not
going to enter the temple. No one rush in, no one

1839
02:01:31,213 --> 02:01:38,475
"be brash. No one make a poor decision. We're going
to wait. No matter what happens, don't enter the

1840
02:01:38,475 --> 02:01:41,565
"temple until we've all had a moment to figure out
what's happening."

1841
02:01:41,565 --> 02:01:42,936
LIAM: No one be a yahoo.

1842
02:01:42,936 --> 02:01:43,900
ORION: Agreed.

1843
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,337
MARISHA: I think it's a trap.

1844
02:01:45,337 --> 02:01:47,987
TALIESIN: If there's going to be a trap, it's
going to be getting us into the temple.

1845
02:01:47,987 --> 02:01:49,702
MARISHA: He wants us. He wants us there.

1846
02:01:49,702 --> 02:01:52,362
TALIESIN: He literally invited us into the temple.

1847
02:01:52,362 --> 02:01:54,014
LAURA: So don't go to the temple.

1848
02:01:54,014 --> 02:01:56,666
TALIESIN: We walk to the temple, we don't enter
the temple.

1849
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:58,179
LAURA: So enter the temple. Understood.

1850
02:01:58,179 --> 02:02:00,599
TALIESIN: Understood. Excellent.

1851
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:09,783
MATT: At this point, beginning to notice the
tunnel itself, the cavern, is swaying back and

1852
02:02:09,783 --> 02:02:13,836
forth a little bit with this. As opposed to a
straight path, the tunnel is beginning to arc left

1853
02:02:13,836 --> 02:02:18,785
and right. There's little pockets and crevices
beginning to show at certain points, and you start

1854
02:02:18,785 --> 02:02:25,896
seeing small bits of bluish crystal jutting in
small pockets out of cracks in the rock.

1855
02:02:25,896 --> 02:02:29,526
MARISHA: Did you say that there was mushrooms? A
mushroom forest, a fungus?

1856
02:02:29,526 --> 02:02:32,365
MATT: Clarota yesterday mentioned a fungal forest.

1857
02:02:32,365 --> 02:02:37,585
MARISHA: But we haven't seen it yet. But we're
starting to go into the crystal caverns.

1858
02:02:37,585 --> 02:02:43,537
MATT: Starting to find bluish crystals, which Pike
makes a motion. "Yes, I saw this in my vision, too!"

1859
02:02:43,537 --> 02:02:47,548
LAURA: Can I touch some of the crystals? Are they
removable?

1860
02:02:47,548 --> 02:02:52,140
MATT: You reach out and touch the crystal. As you
do, go ahead and-- no.

1861
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:55,433
(all laugh)

1862
02:02:55,433 --> 02:02:56,615
TALIESIN: Dick move!

1863
02:02:56,615 --> 02:02:57,876
TRAVIS: I love it.

1864
02:02:57,876 --> 02:02:59,792
LAURA: The greed! The greed gets me.

1865
02:02:59,792 --> 02:03:02,741
MATT: (laughs) You reach out and touch the
crystal, and it's cold to the touch, as is most of

1866
02:03:02,741 --> 02:03:05,763
the stone wall, and you can see there's
condensation on it that gets on your fingers a

1867
02:03:05,763 --> 02:03:10,681
bit. It's smooth, except for the jagged points
where the natural formation juts out. You tug on

1868
02:03:10,681 --> 02:03:14,388
the crystal a little bit, find if there's any
place there that's moveable, and it's pretty solid

1869
02:03:14,388 --> 02:03:16,805
in that rock wall.

1870
02:03:16,805 --> 02:03:21,091
MARISHA: Does it appear to be producing cold?

1871
02:03:21,091 --> 02:03:25,262
MATT: No, the temperature doesn't seem different
at all to the air. There doesn't seem to be a

1872
02:03:25,262 --> 02:03:28,543
source at all; it's the same temperature as the
rest of the tunnel.

1873
02:03:28,543 --> 02:03:30,657
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out
what kind of crystal this may be?

1874
02:03:30,657 --> 02:03:32,519
MATT: Yeah, sure.

1875
02:03:32,519 --> 02:03:36,500
LAURA: Tiberius, these look like the crystals on
your staff.

1876
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:48,186
ORION: "Hm? Oh, ooh, yes! They're pretty." I take
out one of my daggers-- yes, I do have daggers--

1877
02:03:48,186 --> 02:03:52,342
and (clicking noise) I'm going to chip away a
couple of chunks.

1878
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:55,845
TALIESIN: Actually, let's grab a few chunks. I may
have an idea for later.

1879
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:59,240
MARISHA: 13 for my nature check? Not that great,
it's all right.

1880
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,314
TALIESIN: Throw a few into the Bag of Holding.

1881
02:04:01,314 --> 02:04:04,893
MATT: All right. I will say, go ahead and make an
Arcana check as well?

1882
02:04:04,893 --> 02:04:10,152
ORION: Oh, yeah, okay. (mumbling) 14.

1883
02:04:10,152 --> 02:04:15,010
MATT: 14? Okay. It's hard-pressed to find out
where these crystals came from, what their source

1884
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:21,374
is, or if they naturally are here or if they're
put there through some other means, but the

1885
02:04:21,374 --> 02:04:30,566
crystals do have a very, very faint magical
residual energy to them. Useless, almost. It's the

1886
02:04:30,566 --> 02:04:34,836
equivalent of finding crumbs at the bottom of a
cereal box. It's there. You can see at one point

1887
02:04:34,836 --> 02:04:40,752
there was something magical about their presence
or their creation, but it is long faded.

1888
02:04:40,752 --> 02:04:42,266
ORION: Cool. Sweet.

1889
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:43,795
TRAVIS: Do you still want more of them?

1890
02:04:43,795 --> 02:04:45,908
TALIESIN: I'll take a few.

1891
02:04:45,908 --> 02:04:50,346
TRAVIS: I go Hong Kong Phooey on the wall of
crystals with my axe and I just (snarling).

1892
02:04:50,346 --> 02:04:52,195
TALIESIN: Thank you!

1893
02:04:52,195 --> 02:04:57,051
MATT: When the noise dies down, you gather shards
and pieces. Probably enough to fill a small

1894
02:04:57,051 --> 02:05:03,649
bucket. You can indeed fill your small bucket,
should you have one.

1895
02:05:03,649 --> 02:05:06,343
That is your prerogative, Grog.

1896
02:05:06,343 --> 02:05:10,090
TRAVIS: I don't, but I have a fancy robe. And I
put it in there and I bundle it up.

1897
02:05:10,090 --> 02:05:13,096
MATT: Okay! If you had a stick, you could be a
crystal hobo.

1898
02:05:13,096 --> 02:05:14,598
TALIESIN: A fancy bundle of crystals.

1899
02:05:14,598 --> 02:05:16,593
MARISHA: We also have a fancy Bag of Holding.

1900
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:18,669
LAURA: It's in the bag. It's all in the bag.

1901
02:05:18,669 --> 02:05:22,249
MATT: About a half an hour further down this
tunnel, both Vax and Vex simultaneously notice a

1902
02:05:22,249 --> 02:05:27,240
part of the wall to the left that is actually
visibly cracked and what appears to be almost a

1903
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:33,783
narrow passage that juts off to the left. However,
there is a large boulder, solid stone, that is

1904
02:05:33,783 --> 02:05:36,627
wedged into this. Apparently blocking the
passage.

1905
02:05:36,627 --> 02:05:39,006
LIAM: Grog, we need you over here.

1906
02:05:39,006 --> 02:05:39,993
TRAVIS: What?

1907
02:05:39,993 --> 02:05:43,078
LAURA: Could you possibly move this very large,
very heavy boulder for us?

1908
02:05:43,078 --> 02:05:44,329
LIAM: Scanlan, you as well.

1909
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:45,411
SAM: Of course.

1910
02:05:45,411 --> 02:05:46,268
TRAVIS: I need your help.

1911
02:05:46,268 --> 02:05:47,520
LAURA: Pike!

1912
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,211
TRAVIS: I would like to move the boulder.

1913
02:05:50,211 --> 02:05:51,647
MATT: All right.

1914
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:55,187
LAURA: Can I perception around it before we do
anything?

1915
02:05:55,187 --> 02:05:57,033
MATT: Certainly! Go ahead and roll perception.

1916
02:05:57,033 --> 02:05:58,258
TRAVIS: It's in the path?

1917
02:05:58,258 --> 02:06:01,026
LAURA: It's a side path that's been blocked.

1918
02:06:01,026 --> 02:06:03,256
LIAM: 15 for Vax.

1919
02:06:03,256 --> 02:06:09,631
LAURA: Oh, did you see it?! It was there and it
went like that! It was a 20 and then it went

1920
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:15,016
(squeaky noise) because it was on the side. But
that's okay. 20 is what it ended up as.

1921
02:06:15,193 --> 02:06:20,399
MATT: 20? Okay. Both of you guys take a look.
There's nothing immediately dangerous at all. It

1922
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,520
just looks like this rock was not naturally formed
here, of course. It looks like it was wedged in.

1923
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:28,476
Like it was actually placed there intentionally.

1924
02:06:28,476 --> 02:06:30,657
TRAVIS: 26? On the strength check?

1925
02:06:30,657 --> 02:06:34,846
MATT: On the strength check? So as you guys are
explaining, "This seems to be a fairly--"

1926
02:06:34,846 --> 02:06:38,599
You don't even get to finish your sentence before
Grog goes-- grabs the boulder, gets underneath

1927
02:06:38,599 --> 02:06:45,881
and, lifting with the knees, Atlas-style. Puts the
weight on the back and (groans)--

1928
02:06:45,881 --> 02:06:50,745
SAM: I'm singing to help him, to inspire him.
"(singing) Push it, push it real good! Push it,

1929
02:06:50,745 --> 02:06:52,239
"push it real good!"

1930
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:59,178
TRAVIS: (singing) Push it, push it real good.

1931
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:04,237
MATT: With a resounding (scraping sound) scraping
sound and a large crack, some of the rocks that

1932
02:07:04,237 --> 02:07:09,360
it's wedged in break off and tumble to the sides,
and you get the boulder free and you're now

1933
02:07:09,502 --> 02:07:11,411
clutching it on top of you. And it's very, very
heavy.

1934
02:07:11,458 --> 02:07:13,667
ORION: Oh! I use my Mage Hand and I push it, too.

1935
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:17,802
MATT: You lose your balance over the boulder as
it's now shoved off of its axis.

1936
02:07:17,802 --> 02:07:19,714
LAURA: Oh no!

1937
02:07:19,714 --> 02:07:24,177
MATT: It falls behind you, slamming into the wall,
blocking half the passage, the passage you guys

1938
02:07:24,177 --> 02:07:28,490
were going down immediately. You can still pass
it, you just have to walk around it. And you may

1939
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:30,856
have tweaked something in your back a little in
the process.

1940
02:07:30,856 --> 02:07:34,625
LAURA: Oh, Grog, how's your back?

1941
02:07:34,625 --> 02:07:38,780
TRAVIS: I roll over on my stomach and I ask
Trinket to step on my back.

1942
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:41,119
LAURA: Oh, Trinket, give him a massage. He's
really good at it!

1943
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:42,763
TRAVIS: I roll over and have Trinket step on my
back.

1944
02:07:42,763 --> 02:07:45,341
MATT: Trinket gets up, pushes on you with the bear
claws.

1945
02:07:45,341 --> 02:07:50,546
MARISHA: Make biscuits, Trinket. Make biscuits on
Grog's back.

1946
02:07:50,546 --> 02:07:52,351
TRAVIS: (groans in relief)

1947
02:07:52,351 --> 02:07:53,684
MATT: You can hear the cracks.

1948
02:07:53,684 --> 02:07:55,008
LAURA: Can I look down the passageway that was
opened up?

1949
02:07:55,008 --> 02:07:55,923
TRAVIS: Thank god.

1950
02:07:55,923 --> 02:08:02,082
MATT: You can. The passage is very, very thin. It
can maybe fit you individually. It can barely fit

1951
02:08:02,082 --> 02:08:04,535
Grog when you actually go through the passage
proper.

1952
02:08:04,535 --> 02:08:06,243
SAM: It's pretty spacious in here, I think.

1953
02:08:06,243 --> 02:08:07,656
(all laugh)

1954
02:08:07,656 --> 02:08:14,087
MATT: For a gnome, yes. But yeah, it's pitch black
going forward. Which means you guys can see. It's

1955
02:08:14,087 --> 02:08:19,557
equivalent of low light for you in pitch darkness.
About 30 feet ahead of you, you can see the path

1956
02:08:19,557 --> 02:08:24,021
continues for a little bit and then widens up into
what looks like a small chamber. But you'd have to

1957
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:24,971
get closer.

1958
02:08:24,971 --> 02:08:26,476
LAURA: Is it dangerous at all?

1959
02:08:26,476 --> 02:08:28,217
MATT: Make a perception check.

1960
02:08:28,217 --> 02:08:30,677
ORION: Everywhere is dangerous.

1961
02:08:30,677 --> 02:08:33,021
SAM: How far is the chamber?

1962
02:08:33,021 --> 02:08:37,527
MATT: About 30, 35 feet back. So?

1963
02:08:37,527 --> 02:08:38,373
LIAM: 21.

1964
02:08:38,373 --> 02:08:39,319
LAURA: 18.

1965
02:08:39,319 --> 02:08:42,745
MATT: Best you can tell, it just looks like a
chamber and it looks like a hallway.

1966
02:08:42,745 --> 02:08:43,776
TALIESIN: We should investigate.

1967
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:45,124
MARISHA: It just looks like a death trap.

1968
02:08:45,124 --> 02:08:47,252
TRAVIS: If this is a tomb, I'm going to be so
pissed at the two of you.

1969
02:08:47,252 --> 02:08:49,613
LAURA: Tiberius, can you send a little light down
that passageway?

1970
02:08:49,613 --> 02:08:52,646
ORION: Yeah, sure. You want to shoot an arrow for
me, love?

1971
02:08:52,646 --> 02:08:53,840
LAURA: Let's do it.

1972
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:57,267
LIAM: Vax chases the arrow.

1973
02:08:57,267 --> 02:08:59,083
SAM: You're just going to go down the hall?

1974
02:08:59,083 --> 02:09:00,508
LIAM: Yeah, stealth.

1975
02:09:00,508 --> 02:09:05,283
MATT: All right, so, as the light-- the arrow
shaft vibrantly bursts into bright,

1976
02:09:05,283 --> 02:09:10,905
Tiberius-created light. It arcs slightly down the
hallway. Only a 35-foot distance. It goes pretty

1977
02:09:10,905 --> 02:09:14,610
quickly and then (sound of arrow embedding itself)
into what looks like a piece of rock, actually

1978
02:09:14,610 --> 02:09:20,499
wedging itself into a piece of rock before falling
to the ground, chipping a chunk upon impact. As it

1979
02:09:20,499 --> 02:09:30,295
hits, you can see it's a small, roundish, oval
chamber. You can see what looks like small piles

1980
02:09:30,295 --> 02:09:35,129
on the ground at the far end. Still hard to make
out from this distance, but you are welcome to

1981
02:09:35,129 --> 02:09:36,207
enter.

1982
02:09:36,207 --> 02:09:37,609
LIAM: I followed it.

1983
02:09:37,609 --> 02:09:38,954
MATT: You followed it in?

1984
02:09:38,954 --> 02:09:40,010
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a 26 on stealth.

1985
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:41,168
MATT: Right. You rush in.

1986
02:09:41,168 --> 02:09:42,211
LIAM: Follow up the arrow.

1987
02:09:42,211 --> 02:09:44,287
SAM: Bear trap!

1988
02:09:44,287 --> 02:09:46,672
(all laugh)

1989
02:09:46,672 --> 02:09:51,070
MATT: First thing you understand: the air smells
faintly of ancient untouched dust and mildew.

1990
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:52,766
LAURA: Oh no, what did we just let loose?

1991
02:09:52,766 --> 02:10:01,363
MATT: You glance at the floor and notice what
appear to be six long-dead bodies strewn across

1992
02:10:01,363 --> 02:10:02,967
the ground.

1993
02:10:02,967 --> 02:10:04,256
MARISHA: How long-dead?

1994
02:10:04,256 --> 02:10:06,511
MATT: Skeletal and covered in webs.

1995
02:10:06,511 --> 02:10:08,724
SAM: Who's in there? Just Vax right now?

1996
02:10:08,724 --> 02:10:10,296
MATT: Just now Vax.

1997
02:10:10,296 --> 02:10:13,859
LIAM: I'm going to check out the very first, the
closest body to the exit.

1998
02:10:13,859 --> 02:10:17,783
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

1999
02:10:17,783 --> 02:10:19,718
TRAVIS: Nah, it's fine. They're dead.

2000
02:10:19,718 --> 02:10:20,915
LIAM: 19.

2001
02:10:20,915 --> 02:10:25,447
MATT: 19, okay. As you look across the body, I
mean there's nothing formal about this area,

2002
02:10:25,447 --> 02:10:29,763
there's no fine, chiseled structure. It looks like
a natural formation. It just appears to have been

2003
02:10:29,763 --> 02:10:33,906
the final destination for whoever these
individuals were. And you do notice, the way

2004
02:10:33,906 --> 02:10:39,871
they're adorned, they were an adventuring party.
They were people who came down here long ago for

2005
02:10:39,871 --> 02:10:45,963
whatever reason and the last destination was this
small cavernous space.

2006
02:10:45,963 --> 02:10:47,594
LIAM: You said they're covered in webs?

2007
02:10:47,594 --> 02:10:53,077
MATT: There are webs on them, but the webs
themselves are small, natural spider.

2008
02:10:53,077 --> 02:10:56,802
LIAM: Small, natural. So not Bilbo Baggins.

2009
02:10:56,802 --> 02:11:02,098
MATT: But you do notice that each one of their
skulls has a giant hole bored into the bone

2010
02:11:02,098 --> 02:11:03,994
itself. Different places in the skull.

2011
02:11:03,994 --> 02:11:06,638
LIAM: I'm just going to start searching all of
them.

2012
02:11:06,638 --> 02:11:09,853
MATT: Anyone else want to do anything?

2013
02:11:09,853 --> 02:11:11,513
TALIESIN: I'm going to make my way, as well.

2014
02:11:11,513 --> 02:11:12,797
ORION: I thought we were all following.

2015
02:11:12,797 --> 02:11:15,389
MATT: The rest of you make your way in one by one.
It's a small room.

2016
02:11:15,389 --> 02:11:17,706
LAURA: I'm staying outside with Trinket and Grog.

2017
02:11:17,706 --> 02:11:18,926
MATT: Okay, you guys hang out there.

2018
02:11:18,926 --> 02:11:26,697
SAM: I feel like Pike wouldn't want us to do too
much damage to these bodies. I just feel like she

2019
02:11:26,697 --> 02:11:28,485
wouldn't want us to disturb them.

2020
02:11:28,485 --> 02:11:31,952
LIAM: I don't give a shit about these bodies. I
care about what they are carrying.

2021
02:11:32,002 --> 02:11:36,755
MATT: Okay, looking at it, you notice that they
have been here for at least 200 years. Two of the

2022
02:11:36,755 --> 02:11:41,902
bodies are male humans. There are two dwarven
bodies: one male, one's female.

2023
02:11:41,947 --> 02:11:43,545
LAURA: Armor. Look for armor!

2024
02:11:43,545 --> 02:11:45,610
MATT: One female gnome and one half-orc.

2025
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:49,473
MARISHA: Wait, wait. What?

2026
02:11:49,473 --> 02:11:50,796
(all laugh)

2027
02:11:50,796 --> 02:11:51,728
ORION: Half-orc.

2028
02:11:51,728 --> 02:11:57,043
MARISHA: Half-orc? Okay. Hang on. You
listed all that off.

2029
02:11:57,075 --> 02:11:58,484
SAM: I'm going to inspect the gnome.

2030
02:11:58,484 --> 02:11:59,673
LIAM: You're not even in the room.

2031
02:11:59,673 --> 02:12:01,158
MATT: Okay, so you enter the room. Roll an
investigation check.

2032
02:12:01,158 --> 02:12:06,414
SAM: 19.

2033
02:12:06,414 --> 02:12:12,898
MATT: Okay. Looking at her, you find that most of
these bodies have already been for the most part

2034
02:12:12,898 --> 02:12:20,540
turned over and looted. Some of them have no
armor. They're either in plain clothes or it looks

2035
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:27,294
like their bodies have been tossed and taken
whatever was on them, off. You do find, buried in

2036
02:12:27,438 --> 02:12:33,995
the dirt under the gnomish female what looks to be
a pristine ruby. Worth probably quite a bit.

2037
02:12:33,995 --> 02:12:41,984
ORION: I'm going to do an arcana check of 22. Just
on the pile of bodies.

2038
02:12:42,084 --> 02:12:46,346
MATT: Okay, I'll get to you in just a second. You,
as you're inspecting the bodies on the other side,

2039
02:12:46,346 --> 02:12:49,978
you come across the dwarven male is still fully
armored.

2040
02:12:49,978 --> 02:12:50,710
LAURA: Ooh!

2041
02:12:50,710 --> 02:12:52,189
ORION: Nice.

2042
02:12:52,189 --> 02:12:56,737
MATT: Actually has a golden chainmail on and is
clutching what looks like a metal maul. The rest

2043
02:12:56,737 --> 02:13:02,948
of them have no armor and no weapons. But this one
is still fully adorned. And you also notice that

2044
02:13:02,948 --> 02:13:09,783
the female dwarven corpse, while devoid of any
accoutrements, any coin purses, belts or anything,

2045
02:13:09,783 --> 02:13:15,700
does have, hidden within the bony clavicle, what
little bit of stretched dried skin is pulled

2046
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:20,240
against it, a pendant that is gleaming blue.

2047
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:25,605
LIAM: I grab the pendant, and then I start-- this
looks good for Pike, so I start taking the

2048
02:13:25,605 --> 02:13:28,481
chainmail off.

2049
02:13:28,481 --> 02:13:34,896
MATT: You pull the pendant and you look at it. It
has a very beautiful sapphire emblem and you rub

2050
02:13:34,896 --> 02:13:37,820
the dust off of it and you look at it. And you
recognize this emblem. This is the emblem that

2051
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:44,234
adorns House Thunderbrand of Kraghammer. You turn
it over and on the back, there's an engraving on

2052
02:13:44,234 --> 02:13:46,813
the back that says: "For Lorna, my love."

2053
02:13:46,813 --> 02:13:51,320
LAURA: Oh! Didn't he say to bring back some stuff
from the Underdark?

2054
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:53,276
ORION: Yes. This is what we need.

2055
02:13:53,276 --> 02:13:55,005
SAM: Who's he?

2056
02:13:55,005 --> 02:13:57,000
TRAVIS: That name sounds familiar, though.

2057
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,289
LAURA: Oh wait, your magic guy said to bring back
some magic stuff from the Underdark.

2058
02:14:00,289 --> 02:14:03,061
SAM: From the Value of Valor. Tremaine? Was that
his name?

2059
02:14:03,116 --> 02:14:06,952
ORION: And that's what this is. Let me take it and
do-- I'll use that arcana check on that.

2060
02:14:06,952 --> 02:14:12,462
MATT: Yeah, the actual amulet itself does have a
magical essence to it.

2061
02:14:12,462 --> 02:14:18,832
ORION: I think this will do for our friend back up
on the surface. Or under surface.

2062
02:14:18,832 --> 02:14:20,608
SAM: Oh, it's something.

2063
02:14:20,608 --> 02:14:21,873
LAURA: What is it?

2064
02:14:21,873 --> 02:14:23,535
SAM: Amulet of the Shield.

2065
02:14:23,535 --> 02:14:30,102
ORION: (mumbling) This protective amulet of the
shield ... adding plus five to your AC against

2066
02:14:30,102 --> 02:14:31,377
that attack.

2067
02:14:31,377 --> 02:14:32,485
LAURA: What does it do?

2068
02:14:32,485 --> 02:14:33,584
SAM: It protects you.

2069
02:14:33,584 --> 02:14:37,366
MATT: It effectively acts as a Shield spell once
per day. Once per short rest.

2070
02:14:37,366 --> 02:14:38,367
SAM: Once per day?

2071
02:14:38,367 --> 02:14:38,973
MATT: Once per rest.

2072
02:14:38,973 --> 02:14:41,406
ORION: Nice. It's like a magic shield.

2073
02:14:41,406 --> 02:14:43,589
MATT: Yeah, it's a reaction.

2074
02:14:43,589 --> 02:14:45,389
TRAVIS: Do you have to be able to use magic to use
it?

2075
02:14:45,389 --> 02:14:46,581
MATT: No.

2076
02:14:46,581 --> 02:14:47,804
TRAVIS: Oh!

2077
02:14:47,804 --> 02:14:51,144
LAURA: I don't think so. Who has low AC that could
use it?

2078
02:14:51,144 --> 02:14:54,130
ORION: Well, I'm the only glass cannon.

2079
02:14:54,130 --> 02:15:00,385
MATT: So you're going over to the armor. You're
getting the armor for Pike? All right, as you

2080
02:15:00,385 --> 02:15:06,507
reach out and grab the golden chain mail on it,
the cold air around the chainmail is noticeably

2081
02:15:06,507 --> 02:15:09,862
piercingly cold to the touch. Make a constitution
save.

2082
02:15:09,862 --> 02:15:12,767
LAURA: Oh that's why it's still-- Oh no!

2083
02:15:12,767 --> 02:15:14,108
TRAVIS: What was it?

2084
02:15:14,108 --> 02:15:15,175
LAURA: One.

2085
02:15:15,175 --> 02:15:16,075
TRAVIS: One!

2086
02:15:16,075 --> 02:15:16,757
MATT: Natural one.

2087
02:15:16,757 --> 02:15:18,003
TRAVIS: We have a natural one

2088
02:15:18,003 --> 02:15:21,894
MATT: All right. As you guys are all doing this,
you hear the sudden (groans) this clenching of

2089
02:15:21,894 --> 02:15:29,966
breath, and you glance over real fast and find Vax
has fallen onto his back, and his fingers are

2090
02:15:29,966 --> 02:15:35,657
curled back, and you can see this dark energy that
seeps into his body for a second. You can see his

2091
02:15:35,657 --> 02:15:43,184
veins pulsing a little bit. You feel your form--
there's no physical damage taken to you

2092
02:15:43,184 --> 02:15:50,340
whatsoever, but you sense this sapping of your
strength, and your breath is shallow. You imagine

2093
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:55,347
this is what an elderly person would feel like.
You have this lack of energy.

2094
02:15:55,347 --> 02:15:59,025
As you're saying this, Pike comes over to you,
Kima runs over to you and they both take a look at

2095
02:15:59,025 --> 02:16:08,435
you. Pike starts inspecting you, using her
medicine. And Kima, they both look at each other,

2096
02:16:08,435 --> 02:16:14,827
pass a few notes back and forth, and they both
agree. "Well, it appears this dwarven individual,

2097
02:16:14,827 --> 02:16:19,266
"when he came to his end, was not very happy and in
doing so left a very strong curse behind on his

2098
02:16:19,266 --> 02:16:26,031
"body." Look about to each other.

2099
02:16:26,031 --> 02:16:30,342
LAURA: Everything okay in there?

2100
02:16:30,342 --> 02:16:31,797
LIAM: (wheezing) No.

2101
02:16:31,797 --> 02:16:33,093
SAM: Is he dead?

2102
02:16:33,093 --> 02:16:36,341
MATT: No. You are considered cursed, which means
you have disadvantage on all your ability checks

2103
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:37,428
and attacks.

2104
02:16:37,428 --> 02:16:39,218
LAURA: You're cursed?

2105
02:16:39,218 --> 02:16:41,291
MARISHA: How do we get rid of this?

2106
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:43,087
MATT: There are spells like Remove Curse.

2107
02:16:43,087 --> 02:16:47,960
LAURA: I bet Pike has that spell.

2108
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:50,074
TRAVIS: Remove Curse?

2109
02:16:50,074 --> 02:16:51,259
LAURA: I don't know?

2110
02:16:51,259 --> 02:16:54,976
MATT: Pike's not here. I don't have her spell
list.

2111
02:16:54,976 --> 02:16:57,729
TRAVIS: I could try it, hold on. Nope.

2112
02:16:57,729 --> 02:16:58,827
LAURA: Nothing?

2113
02:16:58,827 --> 02:17:00,585
MARISHA: What did you touch? What did you grab?

2114
02:17:00,585 --> 02:17:03,692
LIAM: Armor. It was the armor, wasn't it?

2115
02:17:03,692 --> 02:17:05,281
LAURA: It was that golden armor, yeah.

2116
02:17:05,281 --> 02:17:06,846
TRAVIS: Let's leave the golden armor alone.

2117
02:17:06,846 --> 02:17:09,929
LIAM: (strained) I got this for you, Pike.

2118
02:17:09,929 --> 02:17:13,638
MATT: Wait a second. Ha!

2119
02:17:13,638 --> 02:17:14,715
LAURA: Oh no.

2120
02:17:14,715 --> 02:17:15,792
MATT: All right.

2121
02:17:15,792 --> 02:17:17,823
TRAVIS: Oh no. Don't make him laugh.

2122
02:17:17,823 --> 02:17:23,481
MATT: So. At which point, Kima steps forward and
pushes everyone away for a second and

2123
02:17:23,481 --> 02:17:27,646
concentrates. And she reaches up and grabs the
holy symbol of Bahamut from underneath the front

2124
02:17:27,646 --> 02:17:32,617
of the leather armor, because she still hasn't
exchanged it with you. And it glows with this

2125
02:17:32,617 --> 02:17:38,316
vibrant silver light and the light travels down
her arm, to her hands, to her fingers, and she

2126
02:17:38,316 --> 02:17:43,934
places it out and reaches towards the armor and as
she touches it, she winces slightly, but you see

2127
02:17:43,934 --> 02:17:50,791
this glowing dark furious anger, this face arise
out of the armor, giving off this slight

2128
02:17:50,791 --> 02:17:58,689
whispering howl sound (whispering howl) and then
(poof) dissipate. As you see the divine energy

2129
02:17:58,689 --> 02:18:04,719
begin to dissipate and glide off her hand, she
reaches over and touches you with her hand, and

2130
02:18:04,719 --> 02:18:05,909
the curse is lifted.

2131
02:18:05,909 --> 02:18:07,889
SAM: Oh, that was easy.

2132
02:18:07,889 --> 02:18:10,132
MATT: I looked over and realized that oh, she
actually has that spell.

2133
02:18:10,132 --> 02:18:17,283
LIAM: So I grasp Kima by the hand and say, "That
is one I owe you. That's one I owe you."

2134
02:18:17,283 --> 02:18:22,915
MATT: She gives you a wink and says, "To be
honest, I just really wanted the armor." And she

2135
02:18:22,915 --> 02:18:23,979
pats you on the shoulder.

2136
02:18:23,979 --> 02:18:25,418
LIAM: It's yours.

2137
02:18:25,418 --> 02:18:32,369
MATT: She takes the golden chain off of the body,
she (chuckles) she tells-- no, you're out of the

2138
02:18:32,369 --> 02:18:33,416
room.

2139
02:18:33,416 --> 02:18:36,073
TRAVIS: Do you need me to create a curtain for you
to change behind?

2140
02:18:36,073 --> 02:18:37,646
LAURA: You're not in the room.

2141
02:18:37,646 --> 02:18:40,812
MATT: She finds a cranny in the room. She puts on
the chain mail, replacing the leather armor she

2142
02:18:40,812 --> 02:18:42,562
gives back.

2143
02:18:42,562 --> 02:18:45,086
LAURA: (whispers) Damn it. I was trying to get
it.

2144
02:18:45,086 --> 02:18:54,027
MATT: She does give you the greatsword and then
takes the maul from the corpse of this dwarf. But

2145
02:18:54,027 --> 02:18:58,520
as she takes it from the body, she sits down and
says a silent prayer. Clutches her symbol and as

2146
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:02,953
she does, she takes from one of her pouches a
small bit of blessed water and tosses it across

2147
02:19:02,953 --> 02:19:09,506
the body of the dwarf. Puts it back away and
stands up. "All right. Shall we continue?"

2148
02:19:09,506 --> 02:19:11,076
TALIESIN: Right.

2149
02:19:11,076 --> 02:19:15,977
LIAM: As we leave the cavern, I give one of these
to the dwarven bodies.

2150
02:19:15,977 --> 02:19:20,135
MATT: You swear you hear a slight shift in bone.

2151
02:19:20,135 --> 02:19:23,661
LAURA: Ooh!

2152
02:19:23,661 --> 02:19:25,178
MATT: In silence left behind in darkness.

2153
02:19:25,178 --> 02:19:26,448
SAM: I'm going to take the ruby, too.

2154
02:19:26,448 --> 02:19:27,729
LAURA: Hey, did you get that armor back?

2155
02:19:27,729 --> 02:19:28,904
LIAM: Yeah, I got that armor back.

2156
02:19:28,904 --> 02:19:29,803
LAURA: Hey, can I have that armor? Can I have it?

2157
02:19:29,803 --> 02:19:31,266
LIAM: Sorry, sis.

2158
02:19:31,266 --> 02:19:32,248
LAURA: Please?

2159
02:19:32,248 --> 02:19:33,268
LIAM: Kima has it.

2160
02:19:33,268 --> 02:19:34,368
LAURA: No, she gave it back.

2161
02:19:34,368 --> 02:19:36,336
LIAM: No, she wore it.

2162
02:19:36,336 --> 02:19:37,524
LAURA: No, she gave it back.

2163
02:19:37,524 --> 02:19:40,047
MATT: She put the chain mail on, she gave you the
leather armor back.

2164
02:19:40,047 --> 02:19:41,580
LAURA: Give it, give it.

2165
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:45,766
LIAM: Oh, that's between you and her. I'm not
taking armor off of her.

2166
02:19:45,766 --> 02:19:47,351
LAURA: Please, can I have that armor?

2167
02:19:47,351 --> 02:19:49,617
MATT: She's holding it in her hands. "Certainly."

2168
02:19:49,617 --> 02:19:52,651
LAURA: "Thanks." I go put it on. I don't know what
it is. It's magic though.

2169
02:19:52,651 --> 02:19:54,509
MATT: It's whatever armor you gave her.

2170
02:19:54,509 --> 02:19:56,247
LIAM: Wait, my armor?

2171
02:19:56,247 --> 02:19:57,125
LAURA: Yeah.

2172
02:19:57,125 --> 02:19:58,066
LIAM: That's my armor.

2173
02:19:58,066 --> 02:20:01,832
MATT: The armor that you gave for her to put on in
the Emberhold when she had nothing on.

2174
02:20:01,832 --> 02:20:07,490
LIAM: I gave it to him, he gave it to her. And
you're taking it? Hey, hey, hold on a second!

2175
02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:10,420
LAURA: Too late. Let's just keep moving, all
right? Let's just keep moving.

2176
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:15,035
LIAM: I think we need to roll a brother sister
contest die.

2177
02:20:15,035 --> 02:20:16,536
LAURA: No, we should just--

2178
02:20:16,536 --> 02:20:18,775
LIAM: I grab her by the ear and say, "That's mine.
That's mine."

2179
02:20:18,775 --> 02:20:20,783
LAURA: Ow ow! Come on. I need it.

2180
02:20:20,783 --> 02:20:24,789
LIAM: Squeezing her earlobe really hard.

2181
02:20:24,789 --> 02:20:25,810
LAURA: Roll.

2182
02:20:25,810 --> 02:20:27,166
TRAVIS: Yeah, you two roll. Go for it.

2183
02:20:27,166 --> 02:20:31,208
LAURA: Shit. (yelling) Aha! It's mine, it's mine!

2184
02:20:31,208 --> 02:20:33,852
TRAVIS: (laughing) Sibling justice.

2185
02:20:33,852 --> 02:20:36,666
MATT: Persuasion versus persuasion? Is this what
this was?

2186
02:20:36,666 --> 02:20:37,767
LIAM: Yeah, sure, sure.

2187
02:20:37,767 --> 02:20:39,321
LAURA: Sure it was.

2188
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:41,842
TALIESIN: They played arm punch until one caved.

2189
02:20:41,842 --> 02:20:44,217
TRAVIS: (laughing) It's mine, it's mine.

2190
02:20:44,217 --> 02:20:45,635
LIAM: It's not fair.

2191
02:20:45,635 --> 02:20:47,894
LAURA: Yeah, what does it do?

2192
02:20:47,894 --> 02:20:50,841
LIAM: I'm not fucking-- Figure it out.

2193
02:20:50,841 --> 02:20:54,091
LAURA: All right, I'll just add a bunch of stuff
to my stuff.

2194
02:20:54,091 --> 02:20:56,125
MATT: You keep talking over each other.

2195
02:20:56,125 --> 02:21:00,261
MARISHA: Are you just having party arguments right
now?

2196
02:21:00,261 --> 02:21:04,000
MATT: Apparently. As you guys head back into the
cavern, you move around the boulder that Grog had

2197
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:12,505
moved from the side crevice. And as you continue
for about another 20 or 30 minutes, some of you

2198
02:21:12,505 --> 02:21:18,691
begin to pick up what sounds like the distant
lapping of waves against a shore.

2199
02:21:18,691 --> 02:21:19,868
MARISHA: What.

2200
02:21:19,868 --> 02:21:21,348
TALIESIN: That's never good.

2201
02:21:21,348 --> 02:21:29,908
MATT: (wave noises) As the tunnel begins to curve
larger and larger, eventually you come around a

2202
02:21:29,908 --> 02:21:37,833
bend and the tunnel opens up into a humongous
cavern housing an underground lake circling a

2203
02:21:37,833 --> 02:21:44,941
large island. From what you can see on the edges
of the walls that are closest to you as the island

2204
02:21:44,941 --> 02:21:50,943
disappears into darkness about a hundred feet
ahead of you, there are these blue crystals that

2205
02:21:50,943 --> 02:21:57,149
you've seen throughout this tunnel completely
covering the walls of this entire cavern. There is

2206
02:21:57,149 --> 02:22:02,839
only maybe bits of and places around the wall,
about five, ten feet across where there will be no

2207
02:22:02,839 --> 02:22:07,378
crystal. Otherwise it's just grey stone and blue
crystal jutting from the sides.

2208
02:22:07,378 --> 02:22:17,990
MARISHA: I go over to one of the crystal walls and
I put my hand on the crystal and I cast Daylight,

2209
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:21,374
trying to see if I can emanate it up through the
dome.

2210
02:22:21,374 --> 02:22:27,672
MATT: Okay. You cast Daylight and on the actual
crystal source that you cast it on, daylight

2211
02:22:27,672 --> 02:22:30,693
emanates from it and gives a bright beacon of
light.

2212
02:22:30,693 --> 02:22:37,336
MARISHA: I want it to light up the crystal. Trying
to see how far I can get it to reach up to the

2213
02:22:37,336 --> 02:22:38,170
top.

2214
02:22:38,170 --> 02:22:42,038
MATT: Right. You notice that from the whatever
crystal vein structure some of these are connected

2215
02:22:42,038 --> 02:22:47,703
by, some of them tend to glow in spots, but you
see it's localized. All this crystal isn't

2216
02:22:47,703 --> 02:22:49,307
interconnected, is what this tells you.

2217
02:22:49,307 --> 02:22:50,371
MARISHA: Okay.

2218
02:22:50,371 --> 02:22:53,635
MATT: There are pockets here and there that are
interconnected, but there are multiple veins of it

2219
02:22:53,635 --> 02:22:55,365
going through the entire.

2220
02:22:55,365 --> 02:22:58,817
TALIESIN: What kind of liquid is this lake made
of?

2221
02:22:58,817 --> 02:23:05,087
MATT: So, as you approach, the hard stone surface
you guys have been walking on in the tunnel begins

2222
02:23:05,087 --> 02:23:16,728
to give way to like a coarse sand, almost like a
gravelly shore. And it appears to be fresh water.

2223
02:23:16,728 --> 02:23:24,171
It's clear. The smell is a little musty, but not
too bad. And you approach, and you can see there's

2224
02:23:24,171 --> 02:23:28,485
just these very gentle, very soft waves that
occasionally lap up on the shore, but only a few

2225
02:23:28,485 --> 02:23:31,500
inches. There's not a whole lot of motion to the
water within this cavern.

2226
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,955
TALIESIN: Can we see to the bottom? Is it that
clear?

2227
02:23:33,955 --> 02:23:35,826
MATT: Yeah.

2228
02:23:35,826 --> 02:23:42,701
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I'm going to find a
small rock-- Oh, go ahead.

2229
02:23:42,701 --> 02:23:49,485
MATT: I'll finish my description. (chuckles) So
there's this lake circling this large island

2230
02:23:49,485 --> 02:23:57,151
across the way. You also see on this side of the
shore, central, there is a large stone bridge that

2231
02:23:57,151 --> 02:24:05,072
arches over the lake and makes landfall about
roughly 200 feet on the other side, at the very,

2232
02:24:05,072 --> 02:24:13,074
very tip closest to you of this island. It's about
15 feet wide this bridge, maybe 20 feet, and is an

2233
02:24:13,074 --> 02:24:16,125
immediate walkway onto this island across.

2234
02:24:16,125 --> 02:24:28,429
You can see just faintly on the edge of this
island a glowing bioluminescent fungal forest that

2235
02:24:28,429 --> 02:24:35,076
covers a large portion of this island's top side.
The edges of it, you can see, rise up into cliffs

2236
02:24:35,076 --> 02:24:38,953
that have eroded over time and are rather stark in
places.

2237
02:24:38,953 --> 02:24:44,782
MARISHA: Plants! Look, living things!

2238
02:24:44,782 --> 02:24:51,707
TALIESIN: Clarota? Is this in any way dangerous?

2239
02:24:51,707 --> 02:24:58,962
MATT: Clarota, as you look over, is gliding into
the cavern. It's the closest thing you can imagine

2240
02:24:58,962 --> 02:25:05,653
seeing a mind flayer to smiling. He's looking
about and in response to you, a few moments later,

2241
02:25:05,653 --> 02:25:13,644
he says, "We're near home."

2242
02:25:13,644 --> 02:25:17,346
TALIESIN: Let's all remember his feet don't
actually touch the ground.

2243
02:25:17,346 --> 02:25:21,662
TRAVIS: Right. Do you know if there's anything in
the water?

2244
02:25:21,662 --> 02:25:34,148
MATT: He glances over to you. "There are many
things in the water. Fish. Crustaceans." He points

2245
02:25:34,148 --> 02:25:41,399
over, and you can see there is this small, very
pale, colorless, whitish-gray crab that's over to

2246
02:25:41,399 --> 02:25:48,158
the side, that looks weird, malformed. One claw is
twisted on itself and dragging behind it. And it

2247
02:25:48,158 --> 02:25:53,057
skitters off into the water. Everyone make a
perception check.

2248
02:25:53,057 --> 02:25:54,825
TALIESIN: Yay.

2249
02:26:02,279 --> 02:26:03,351
SAM: No!

2250
02:26:03,351 --> 02:26:04,929
LAURA: Oh, natural 20!

2251
02:26:04,929 --> 02:26:05,995
MATT: Oh snap.

2252
02:26:05,995 --> 02:26:06,917
ORION: 14.

2253
02:26:06,917 --> 02:26:07,767
MARISHA: 20.

2254
02:26:07,767 --> 02:26:08,728
TALIESIN: Eight.

2255
02:26:08,728 --> 02:26:09,865
TRAVIS: Six.

2256
02:26:09,865 --> 02:26:11,421
LIAM: One.

2257
02:26:11,421 --> 02:26:17,794
MATT: Oh, you two. As you all walk up to the edge
of the shore line and you're inspecting the water,

2258
02:26:17,794 --> 02:26:25,000
feeling for it. You look over and on the far left
side of the shore, you can see just below the

2259
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:31,910
waterline what looks like... a sunken boat. Or
two.

2260
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:33,143
LIAM: I can't see shit.

2261
02:26:33,143 --> 02:26:35,826
LAURA: What? There's a sunken boat in the lake.

2262
02:26:35,826 --> 02:26:37,449
TRAVIS: Really, should I go get it?

2263
02:26:37,449 --> 02:26:44,179
LAURA: Down here? Clarota, why? Why boats?

2264
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:53,118
MATT: Clarota gives you a look. "I do not know.
Many things wander these tunnels beyond my kin. We

2265
02:26:53,118 --> 02:26:56,301
"are but one of its denizens."

2266
02:26:56,301 --> 02:26:57,666
LAURA: Who's a good swimmer?

2267
02:26:57,666 --> 02:26:59,272
TRAVIS: Me! I'm actually a really good swimmer.

2268
02:26:59,272 --> 02:27:00,093
MARISHA: Me.

2269
02:27:00,093 --> 02:27:01,264
LIAM: Lady Keyleth.

2270
02:27:01,264 --> 02:27:02,557
TALIESIN: She's a very good swimmer.

2271
02:27:02,557 --> 02:27:04,072
LAURA: You guys want to take a look?

2272
02:27:04,072 --> 02:27:09,905
MARISHA: I run over to the edge of the water and I
do a swan dive and as I swan dive, I turn into a

2273
02:27:09,905 --> 02:27:11,968
shark in the water.

2274
02:27:11,968 --> 02:27:12,801
MATT: Okay.

2275
02:27:12,801 --> 02:27:14,756
TRAVIS: I run to the water, as well, and I fucking
cannonball.

2276
02:27:14,756 --> 02:27:17,123
(all laugh)

2277
02:27:17,123 --> 02:27:26,261
MATT: So Keyleth's form jumps into the air, this
thin, lithe half elven figure that then turns into

2278
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:31,983
this giant shark beast that (splash sound) into
the water underneath. A few moments later, Grog

2279
02:27:31,983 --> 02:27:35,876
jumps in. Big splashing sound.

2280
02:27:35,876 --> 02:27:44,654
ORION: I'm going to follow and I'll stay behind
enough to where I can cast? Do I

2281
02:27:44,703 --> 02:27:46,932
have to get in the water also?

2282
02:27:46,932 --> 02:27:50,961
MATT: You can. You still can't quite see what
everyone's going for, other than what she said.

2283
02:27:50,961 --> 02:27:55,329
ORION: Okay, I'll get a little-- I won't jump in
quite yet, but I'll get to the edge.

2284
02:27:55,329 --> 02:28:02,068
MATT: All right. The water is freezing cold. You
could swear this should've turned to ice by now.

2285
02:28:02,068 --> 02:28:06,402
Because your veins certainly feel like they have
upon impact. You immediately get over that as you

2286
02:28:06,402 --> 02:28:11,175
transform into a natural creature that's used to
cold water. Grog, it's fucking cold.

2287
02:28:11,175 --> 02:28:14,679
TRAVIS: One and a half inches? Me, too.

2288
02:28:14,679 --> 02:28:19,960
(all laugh)

2289
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:24,008
ORION: That's a medical condition for a goliath.

2290
02:28:24,008 --> 02:28:28,781
MATT: There aren't usually this many penis jokes
in a session, folks. It just happens to be one of

2291
02:28:28,781 --> 02:28:36,954
those days. So, glancing down below, you see it
too. There are approximately two and a half boats

2292
02:28:36,954 --> 02:28:45,090
that are made of some sort of a combination of
wood and metal, like a heavily rusted iron. One of

2293
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:50,346
them looks mildly serviceable, the other one is
broken with a large hole in the bottom of it.

2294
02:28:50,346 --> 02:28:51,789
MARISHA: I do a lap.

2295
02:28:51,789 --> 02:28:52,670
MATT: Okay.

2296
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:53,849
MARISHA: Go check it out.

2297
02:28:53,849 --> 02:28:57,883
MATT: You look around. There doesn't appear to be
much else around, but you do catch what looks like

2298
02:28:57,883 --> 02:29:04,934
a semblance of a half-eaten corpse, a bone that is
left partially buried in the ground. You don't

2299
02:29:04,934 --> 02:29:08,392
know how long that's been there, either. It's
bleached bone at this point. Whatever fishes live

2300
02:29:08,392 --> 02:29:10,664
in this landscape have picked it clean.

2301
02:29:10,664 --> 02:29:12,503
MARISHA: So there's nothing in the boats at all?

2302
02:29:12,503 --> 02:29:14,105
MATT: Nope.

2303
02:29:14,105 --> 02:29:16,565
LAURA: Good times.

2304
02:29:16,565 --> 02:29:17,529
MARISHA: Weird.

2305
02:29:17,529 --> 02:29:19,112
SAM: Awesome.

2306
02:29:19,112 --> 02:29:20,484
ORION: We could just keep going.

2307
02:29:20,484 --> 02:29:21,573
LAURA: Maybe you come back.

2308
02:29:21,573 --> 02:29:23,704
TRAVIS: Ask him if the bridge is booby-trapped.

2309
02:29:23,704 --> 02:29:25,126
MATT: Make a perception check.

2310
02:29:25,126 --> 02:29:31,140
MARISHA: Make a perception check, (mumbles) yep,
yep.

2311
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:32,607
LAURA: Are you still in the water?

2312
02:29:32,607 --> 02:29:34,328
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm shivering.

2313
02:29:34,381 --> 02:29:35,899
MARISHA: 12. As a shark, right?

2314
02:29:35,899 --> 02:29:36,941
MATT: Yeah.

2315
02:29:36,941 --> 02:29:38,690
LIAM: Plus three for shark.

2316
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:41,129
MATT: Okay. You do a couple laps. Nothing really
catches your eye.

2317
02:29:41,129 --> 02:29:47,345
TRAVIS: (gulps) I take a big breath and swim down
to where the giant shark is. Can I also perception

2318
02:29:47,345 --> 02:29:48,348
check?

2319
02:29:48,348 --> 02:29:49,915
MATT: You can also attempt a perception.

2320
02:29:49,915 --> 02:29:55,945
TRAVIS: This is like one out of every five games that I
get to. 12. Plus zero.

2321
02:29:56,267 --> 02:29:58,076
MATT: You found some boats, yo!

2322
02:29:58,076 --> 02:29:59,134
LAURA: Yay.

2323
02:29:59,134 --> 02:30:00,137
TRAVIS: Boats!

2324
02:30:00,137 --> 02:30:01,351
MATT: They are broken.

2325
02:30:01,351 --> 02:30:07,791
MARISHA: I go and I see that Grog's underwater and
I Flipper him and go up under him and, "Hold on!

2326
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:09,958
"Here we go."

2327
02:30:09,958 --> 02:30:14,063
MATT: Giant shark comes up under you and nudges
you aggressively and lifts you towards the

2328
02:30:14,063 --> 02:30:15,003
surface.

2329
02:30:15,003 --> 02:30:17,528
LIAM: Dolphin hump him a little bit?

2330
02:30:17,585 --> 02:30:22,459
MARISHA: Well... You've heard of those-- never
mind. I'm just going to keep going.

2331
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:25,374
MATT: You guys all watch as Grog is now riding a
shark.

2332
02:30:25,374 --> 02:30:27,292
LAURA: Awesome. Awesome.

2333
02:30:27,292 --> 02:30:29,637
TRAVIS: Should we ask Clarota if the bridge is
safe to travel?

2334
02:30:29,637 --> 02:30:36,615
LAURA: Clarota, is that mushroom forest, I mean,
is that your home?

2335
02:30:36,615 --> 02:30:39,666
SAM: Should we go there? Should we skip it,
Clarota?

2336
02:30:39,666 --> 02:30:47,503
MATT: "The forest certainly surrounds the city."

2337
02:30:47,503 --> 02:30:51,287
MARISHA: I carry Grog over to the island on the
other side.

2338
02:30:51,287 --> 02:30:57,814
MATT: "There are many places of entry within this
cavern." And you see Clarota concentrate for a

2339
02:30:57,814 --> 02:31:04,500
second, and within all of your minds, you suddenly
have a very clear image of this entire cavern: its

2340
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:17,133
layout, what strange shape it is, where the
general overlook is, and as clear as day, you have

2341
02:31:17,133 --> 02:31:20,988
an entire visual of the inside of this cavern.

2342
02:31:20,988 --> 02:31:28,297
You guys reside down here, right by the bridge on
this edge of the beach. This green represents the

2343
02:31:28,297 --> 02:31:34,731
fungus and this, you imagine, represents the city.
The temple being central there.

2344
02:31:34,731 --> 02:31:36,775
LAURA: We should not take the bridge.

2345
02:31:36,775 --> 02:31:41,015
SAM: Yeah, that's a lot of fungus to get through
before the city. Are they still down there in the

2346
02:31:41,015 --> 02:31:42,151
water?

2347
02:31:42,151 --> 02:31:43,341
MATT: Yes, they are.

2348
02:31:43,341 --> 02:31:45,295
SAM: Let's wait until they get back before we
decide.

2349
02:31:45,295 --> 02:31:49,331
MATT: I'll put this down here in case you want
people to see that.

2350
02:31:49,331 --> 02:31:52,945
ORION: Where are we on that map?

2351
02:31:52,945 --> 02:31:54,228
MATT: You guys are right here.

2352
02:31:54,228 --> 02:31:56,980
LIAM: Grog, can you pull up any of those boats?

2353
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:59,177
TRAVIS: Pull?

2354
02:31:59,177 --> 02:32:02,194
LIAM: Pull them up, Grog. Pull them up.

2355
02:32:02,194 --> 02:32:03,297
LAURA: I like it.

2356
02:32:03,297 --> 02:32:12,848
MARISHA: I go over and I swim Grog over. And can
I, as a shark, give some shark push from the

2357
02:32:12,848 --> 02:32:13,846
bottom?

2358
02:32:13,846 --> 02:32:15,248
MATT: Sure.

2359
02:32:15,248 --> 02:32:25,727
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, yes, we have an underwater
breathing kit, that we bought at the store.

2360
02:32:25,727 --> 02:32:27,736
There's two of them.

2361
02:32:27,736 --> 02:32:28,702
MARISHA: Sick!

2362
02:32:28,702 --> 02:32:29,525
MATT: Potion?

2363
02:32:29,525 --> 02:32:31,516
SAM: I don't know, we bought one (laughs).

2364
02:32:31,516 --> 02:32:34,500
TRAVIS: I wrote, "two underwater breathing," and
didn't write what it was.

2365
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:37,841
MATT: Two underwater breathing biscuits. Two
underwater breathing waffles.

2366
02:32:37,841 --> 02:32:38,817
TALIESIN: It was totally potions.

2367
02:32:38,817 --> 02:32:39,716
MARISHA: Potions.

2368
02:32:39,716 --> 02:32:41,528
MATT: I'm pretty sure it was potions. I'm pretty
sure they were potions.

2369
02:32:41,528 --> 02:32:42,972
ORION: What type of boat is this?

2370
02:32:42,972 --> 02:32:45,687
MATT: You haven't had a good look at it yet.

2371
02:32:45,687 --> 02:32:50,502
MARISHA: I tried to look, but I'm a shark, so I
don't know shit, really. It's a boat.

2372
02:32:50,502 --> 02:32:55,417
TRAVIS: Okay, so we swim up to the top and we come
back to the shore and you're just in the water

2373
02:32:55,417 --> 02:32:57,148
still. "Yes?"

2374
02:32:57,148 --> 02:32:59,351
SAM: What's down there? Do you need help?

2375
02:32:59,351 --> 02:33:01,365
TRAVIS: It looks like some kind of boat.

2376
02:33:01,365 --> 02:33:03,069
SAM: That's all you got?

2377
02:33:03,069 --> 02:33:04,850
TRAVIS: My perception is shit.

2378
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:07,805
SAM: Well, should we try again with someone who
has better perception?

2379
02:33:07,805 --> 02:33:09,187
LAURA: You want me to go down there?

2380
02:33:09,187 --> 02:33:10,003
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

2381
02:33:10,003 --> 02:33:11,211
LAURA: All right. Let's do it.

2382
02:33:11,211 --> 02:33:12,830
LIAM: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to pull up
one of those boats.

2383
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:15,519
LAURA: Maybe we should check out the boats first.

2384
02:33:15,568 --> 02:33:16,576
MARISHA: You want to jump on my back?

2385
02:33:16,576 --> 02:33:17,454
LAURA: Yeah.

2386
02:33:17,454 --> 02:33:24,039
ORION: "Is that all we need to do? Okay, fine."
And I walk over to the thing and I jaunt off into

2387
02:33:24,039 --> 02:33:25,250
the water.

2388
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:27,500
MATT: Tiberius slowly disappears beneath the
surface. It is cold!

2389
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:32,188
ORION: "Oh, it's so cold." I take out one of my
bottles right before I go under. My bottle of

2390
02:33:32,188 --> 02:33:33,156
air.

2391
02:33:33,156 --> 02:33:34,616
SAM: What?

2392
02:33:34,616 --> 02:33:36,151
LAURA: His air bottle.

2393
02:33:36,151 --> 02:33:44,083
MATT: You see the bubbles break on the surface and
then eventually the bubbles stop. Tiberius may

2394
02:33:44,083 --> 02:33:45,873
have drowned; you don't know.

2395
02:33:45,873 --> 02:33:47,949
MARISHA: I can see him.

2396
02:33:47,949 --> 02:33:58,829
ORION: I swim over there. I use my tail. I think
I'm a good swimmer. And I want to swim up to where

2397
02:33:58,829 --> 02:34:00,219
I can see the boat.

2398
02:34:00,219 --> 02:34:04,878
MATT: Okay, this doesn't take you too far. It's
maybe 60 feet from the edge of the coastline.

2399
02:34:04,878 --> 02:34:08,644
ORION: Oh, okay. Is it darkened? Can I see the
boat now?

2400
02:34:08,644 --> 02:34:12,044
MATT: You can see, as long as you're traveling
with a Light spell going on, which I assume you do

2401
02:34:12,044 --> 02:34:13,108
at most points.

2402
02:34:13,108 --> 02:34:14,516
ORION: Yes. I still have my staff.

2403
02:34:14,516 --> 02:34:19,270
MATT: But yeah, you see there are two and a half
boats, essentially. They're large, looks like they

2404
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:25,328
were meant specifically for travel. You're not
quite sure where it may have come from.

2405
02:34:25,328 --> 02:34:27,329
ORION: How large is it?

2406
02:34:27,329 --> 02:34:31,990
MATT: I'd say it's maybe about 15, almost 20 feet
from end to end.

2407
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:39,916
ORION: Okay, so I notice it. You're nudging the
one that you want, right? Is that's what's going

2408
02:34:39,916 --> 02:34:43,445
on? So I notice that.

2409
02:34:43,445 --> 02:34:47,303
LIAM: Pull it up.

2410
02:34:47,303 --> 02:34:52,827
MARISHA: I try and push it.

2411
02:34:52,827 --> 02:34:59,238
ORION: I (ping) my Ioun Stone, direct Telekinesis
to lift up the boat out.

2412
02:34:59,238 --> 02:35:02,698
MATT: So you're putting your Ioun Stone on?

2413
02:35:02,698 --> 02:35:04,071
SAM: He gave the other one to me.

2414
02:35:04,071 --> 02:35:07,554
MATT: Oh, got you. Okay, so you put on the Ioun
Stone.

2415
02:35:07,554 --> 02:35:10,878
ORION: And I cast Telekinesis on the boat to lift
it up.

2416
02:35:10,878 --> 02:35:11,807
MATT: Okay.

2417
02:35:11,807 --> 02:35:13,478
MARISHA: And I try to swim underneath it.

2418
02:35:13,478 --> 02:35:18,583
MATT: Okay. There's a rustle in the waves on the
surface of the water, as you see all of a sudden

2419
02:35:18,583 --> 02:35:22,721
this (impact sound) this bowing and splashing
begins to occur. The ship begins to rise out of

2420
02:35:22,721 --> 02:35:24,971
the sediment on the bottom of the lake.

2421
02:35:24,971 --> 02:35:26,899
ORION: I try to get it just right on the lip.

2422
02:35:26,899 --> 02:35:30,200
MATT: It gets up. It's filled with water, you tip
it on its side and spill the rest of the water

2423
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:36,080
out. There's still a large hole on the bottom of
the boat, on the inside. And you carry it over

2424
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:40,343
back to the surface of the shore and rest it
gently onto the rock.

2425
02:35:40,343 --> 02:35:42,740
LAURA: Can you fit that boat in your Wheel of
Mending?

2426
02:35:42,740 --> 02:35:46,049
ORION: I'm underwater. I'm going to jaunt back up,
up to the surface.

2427
02:35:46,049 --> 02:35:50,442
LAURA: Tiberius, welcome to the surface. Can you
use your Wheel of Mending on that boat that you

2428
02:35:50,442 --> 02:35:51,967
just pulled up?

2429
02:35:51,967 --> 02:36:01,424
ORION: I put my bottle away. "I don't know. It's a
good question. I mean, I don't see why not."

2430
02:36:01,424 --> 02:36:03,965
SAM: Percy could assist. He's got some
engineering.

2431
02:36:03,965 --> 02:36:10,021
TALIESIN: Well, I can't help with the wheel, but I
could repair the boat, in theory.

2432
02:36:10,021 --> 02:36:13,520
ORION: Percy, why don't you give it a whack before
we put a boat on the Mending Wheel.

2433
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:17,772
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a list of things that
I'm going to need. I may have to send them down

2434
02:36:17,772 --> 02:36:19,673
for more parts of boats from the other boats.

2435
02:36:19,673 --> 02:36:22,053
LAURA: Try the wheel first.

2436
02:36:22,053 --> 02:36:25,946
MATT: Telekinesis is still in effect currently, so
if you wanted to do that, now would be the time.

2437
02:36:25,946 --> 02:36:27,784
TALIESIN: Bring up the broken boat.

2438
02:36:27,784 --> 02:36:29,279
ORION: Oh, yes, here you are.

2439
02:36:29,279 --> 02:36:34,849
MATT: Okay, so Tiberius comes back with the half
boat, essentially, that's cracked in half and part

2440
02:36:34,849 --> 02:36:40,970
of it is ruined and broken. But there's still a
sizeable amount of oxidized iron, metal, and wood

2441
02:36:40,970 --> 02:36:43,518
here that you think would be serviceable for
repairs.

2442
02:36:43,518 --> 02:36:48,086
TALIESIN: Please don't roll a one. Okay, so I'm
going to do a little tinkering to see if I can get

2443
02:36:48,086 --> 02:36:49,181
this fixed.

2444
02:36:49,181 --> 02:36:50,238
MATT: Okay.

2445
02:36:50,238 --> 02:36:52,995
TALIESIN: Unless you want to try the wheel first?

2446
02:36:52,995 --> 02:36:56,012
MATT: It's up to you guys. So you're going to go
ahead and make a tinkering check?

2447
02:36:56,012 --> 02:36:57,912
TALIESIN: I'll do a tinkering check first and then
try the wheel.

2448
02:36:57,912 --> 02:36:59,204
ORION: Why don't you tinker it first.

2449
02:36:59,204 --> 02:37:01,083
MATT: Anyone want to help?

2450
02:37:01,083 --> 02:37:02,931
TALIESIN: What do I use as my modifier?

2451
02:37:02,931 --> 02:37:07,580
MATT: I would say this is a key point in time for
a Scanlan song.

2452
02:37:07,580 --> 02:37:08,998
SAM: Oh! Yes, of course.

2453
02:37:08,998 --> 02:37:12,162
MATT: You use this bardic inspiration specifically
for stuff like this.

2454
02:37:12,162 --> 02:37:18,228
SAM: Oh, I do. Yes, I will inspire you. I don't
know what to sing. What's a boat song?

2455
02:37:18,228 --> 02:37:24,652
MARISHA: (singing) The love boat...

2456
02:37:24,652 --> 02:37:27,332
SAM: How does it start?

2457
02:37:27,332 --> 02:37:31,621
TALIESIN: I'm not feeling very inspired.

2458
02:37:31,621 --> 02:37:33,500
SAM: (singing hesitantly) Something exciting's
waiting for you?

2459
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:35,081
(all laugh)

2460
02:37:35,081 --> 02:37:39,486
SAM: (singing) I'm on a boat, motherfucker! I'm on
a motherfucking boat. (speaking) That's all I

2461
02:37:39,486 --> 02:37:40,779
got.

2462
02:37:40,779 --> 02:37:42,069
TALIESIN: I feel inspired.

2463
02:37:42,069 --> 02:37:43,426
MATT: I'll give you a d6 for that.

2464
02:37:43,426 --> 02:37:46,892
(all laugh)

2465
02:37:46,892 --> 02:37:50,768
LIAM: (singing) Sailing...

2466
02:37:50,768 --> 02:37:55,217
SAM: (singing) Takes me away to where I've always
heard it go.

2467
02:37:55,217 --> 02:37:56,886
TALIESIN: That's worth a d10.

2468
02:37:56,886 --> 02:37:58,771
MATT: If it wasn't Vax singing.

2469
02:37:58,771 --> 02:38:00,775
TALIESIN: Okay.

2470
02:38:00,775 --> 02:38:01,906
MATT: Go for it.

2471
02:38:01,906 --> 02:38:03,534
TALIESIN: All right. What do I add to the
modifier, by the way?

2472
02:38:03,534 --> 02:38:07,214
MATT: You add whatever your tinkering bonus is,
which should be your dex.

2473
02:38:07,214 --> 02:38:14,586
TALIESIN: My dex modifier, thanks. Thank god. 13.

2474
02:38:14,586 --> 02:38:16,850
MATT: 13 total?

2475
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:18,645
TALIESIN: Yeah, 13 total.

2476
02:38:18,645 --> 02:38:23,221
MATT: Okay. You take a while with it. It takes a
little bit longer than you anticipated, but you

2477
02:38:23,221 --> 02:38:27,632
have your general tools with you. You hammer away.
About an hour and a half to two hours later,

2478
02:38:27,632 --> 02:38:32,532
you're sweating, your muscles are sore, but you
feel like you've managed to get the hole for the

2479
02:38:32,532 --> 02:38:35,880
most part patched. Now it's just to test its
buoyancy.

2480
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:37,867
SAM: You want to try the Mending Wheel?

2481
02:38:37,867 --> 02:38:43,154
ORION: My spell doesn't last that long.

2482
02:38:43,154 --> 02:38:48,126
TALIESIN: Let's put it in the water and see what
happens.

2483
02:38:48,126 --> 02:38:51,531
TRAVIS: I start pushing the boat back in the water
and I jump in and I start jumping up and down.

2484
02:38:51,531 --> 02:38:57,854
MATT: You push it in. You leap in the boat. It
(impact sound) gives to the 600 pounds that are

2485
02:38:57,854 --> 02:39:04,629
Grog. It splashes a bit, it lifts, it seems to be
holding. It's leaving ripples in the water.

2486
02:39:04,629 --> 02:39:07,252
LAURA: Will it fit all of us, you think?

2487
02:39:07,252 --> 02:39:11,659
MARISHA: I'm going to stay a shark and follow in
the water.

2488
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:13,011
SAM: Let's pile in the boat.

2489
02:39:13,011 --> 02:39:15,696
MARISHA: Can I tow them?

2490
02:39:15,696 --> 02:39:17,357
TALIESIN: I was about to say, we can make a
harness out of rope.

2491
02:39:17,357 --> 02:39:19,067
MARISHA: Yeah.

2492
02:39:19,067 --> 02:39:21,016
TALIESIN: We'll be less conspicuous.

2493
02:39:21,016 --> 02:39:22,968
MARISHA: Yeah. Not as much rowing.

2494
02:39:22,968 --> 02:39:24,594
TALIESIN: Shark power is far less conspicuous.

2495
02:39:24,594 --> 02:39:32,060
ORION: I saunter on the boat up next to Grog and
go, "Excuse me." As I open the bag of holding and

2496
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:37,218
take out the magic carpet (sound of carpet
unfurling), and I hop on that.

2497
02:39:37,218 --> 02:39:39,272
LAURA: I get on the magic carpet.

2498
02:39:39,272 --> 02:39:45,544
ORION: I'd rather be a free agent on this one. I'm
not here to fight on water.

2499
02:39:45,544 --> 02:39:48,961
TALIESIN: I'm setting up a gun mount on the boat,
just in case.

2500
02:39:48,961 --> 02:39:53,383
MARISHA: Do you guys want to get out the rope and
put it around me?

2501
02:39:53,383 --> 02:39:55,611
TALIESIN: We'll get out the rope and throw a loop
for you to grab.

2502
02:39:55,611 --> 02:39:57,302
MARISHA: I swim through the loop.

2503
02:39:57,302 --> 02:39:59,814
LAURA: Trinket, get in the boat.

2504
02:39:59,814 --> 02:40:02,144
SAM: I just want to know which way we're sailing.
Are we going left?

2505
02:40:02,144 --> 02:40:06,466
LIAM: Clarota put the image all in our heads.

2506
02:40:06,466 --> 02:40:08,799
TALIESIN: See, there's an island over on that
side.

2507
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:12,081
SAM: This way, or do we want to go this way?

2508
02:40:12,081 --> 02:40:17,400
LIAM: Vox Machina, there is an island, there are
also two small caves and--

2509
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:19,216
LAURA: There's three small caves.

2510
02:40:19,216 --> 02:40:20,212
LIAM: Where?

2511
02:40:20,212 --> 02:40:21,670
LAURA: Well, two small caves and then a path.

2512
02:40:21,670 --> 02:40:24,364
LIAM: Two and then rivers and paths out, yes.

2513
02:40:24,364 --> 02:40:29,332
MARISHA: Do we want to check them all out? Clear
out the fog of war.

2514
02:40:29,332 --> 02:40:32,678
LIAM: We could go straight for the big prize.

2515
02:40:32,678 --> 02:40:38,999
ORION: Are we all agreeing that, have we all
decided to come here or here?

2516
02:40:38,999 --> 02:40:40,381
LAURA: Toward the island, I think.

2517
02:40:40,381 --> 02:40:45,839
MARISHA: I think if we can go here to this little
island, I might be able to do some think-y, spy-y

2518
02:40:45,839 --> 02:40:48,964
scrying stuff before we storm the city.

2519
02:40:48,964 --> 02:40:49,815
LIAM: What do you mean, Keyleth?

2520
02:40:49,815 --> 02:40:52,236
TRAVIS: Loot the cave first, and then the island.

2521
02:40:52,236 --> 02:40:55,265
LAURA: Cave first?

2522
02:40:55,265 --> 02:40:56,877
MARISHA: Cave first.

2523
02:40:56,877 --> 02:40:57,820
TRAVIS: Right, cave first.

2524
02:40:57,820 --> 02:40:59,473
LAURA: And then island. Let's go there.

2525
02:40:59,473 --> 02:41:07,195
LIAM: When we eventually want to take the temple
and kill this son of a bitch, we probably want the

2526
02:41:07,195 --> 02:41:11,288
shortest amount of distance on land as possible,
which means coming in from the north end where

2527
02:41:11,288 --> 02:41:12,924
Tiberius is pointing.

2528
02:41:12,924 --> 02:41:14,821
ORION: Coming in through here, which is the least
resistance.

2529
02:41:14,821 --> 02:41:16,644
LIAM: Yes. I agree.

2530
02:41:16,644 --> 02:41:17,772
ORION: Directly to the temple.

2531
02:41:17,772 --> 02:41:19,911
LIAM: But I think we're all a little slap happy
and curious.

2532
02:41:19,911 --> 02:41:22,821
LAURA: That might be cliffs on the back end,
though, you guys. We won't be able to scale

2533
02:41:22,821 --> 02:41:23,798
those.

2534
02:41:23,798 --> 02:41:28,317
MATT: Best you can tell, from the image that was
given to you, any of those sections along the edge

2535
02:41:28,317 --> 02:41:30,730
that have the jagged lines are cliffs.

2536
02:41:30,730 --> 02:41:33,188
LIAM: But the north-western edge has a beach?

2537
02:41:33,188 --> 02:41:34,238
MATT: Correct.

2538
02:41:34,238 --> 02:41:37,325
LIAM: But, we're curious about the island?

2539
02:41:37,325 --> 02:41:38,753
SAM: Let's just set sail.

2540
02:41:38,753 --> 02:41:43,110
LAURA: Set sail. Towards the island!

2541
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:49,442
LIAM: So, Vox Machina, are we going to head around
the southern, south-eastern edge?

2542
02:41:49,442 --> 02:41:50,502
TALIESIN: Yes.

2543
02:41:50,502 --> 02:41:51,923
LAURA: We're going, we're sailing.

2544
02:41:51,923 --> 02:41:53,470
LIAM: Does anyone know how to steer this thing?

2545
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:55,192
MARISHA: I'm towing us.

2546
02:41:55,192 --> 02:41:56,332
TALIESIN: We're shark-powered.

2547
02:41:56,332 --> 02:41:57,421
LIAM: Oh, towing.

2548
02:41:57,421 --> 02:42:00,866
LAURA: I'm on the carpet with you.

2549
02:42:00,866 --> 02:42:01,824
ORION: Yes!

2550
02:42:01,824 --> 02:42:03,826
LIAM: That is impressive.

2551
02:42:03,826 --> 02:42:07,598
MATT: All right. So, you guys continue down the
right side of the path. You push off into the

2552
02:42:07,598 --> 02:42:09,805
water, being towed by Keyleth in shark form.

2553
02:42:09,805 --> 02:42:12,626
TALIESIN: Aw, yeah.

2554
02:42:12,626 --> 02:42:16,291
LAURA: Should we put Pass Without a Trace on us?

2555
02:42:16,291 --> 02:42:17,318
SAM: She's a shark.

2556
02:42:17,318 --> 02:42:19,130
TALIESIN: We're pretty stealthy.

2557
02:42:19,130 --> 02:42:23,138
MARISHA: I'll hug the far wall, though. I'll hug
the wall.

2558
02:42:23,138 --> 02:42:30,607
MATT: You hug the far edge of the water. Pushing
across, you find a way around and as you begin to

2559
02:42:30,607 --> 02:42:35,179
look up the wall, you can see once again how these
crystalline structures are spread out across this

2560
02:42:35,179 --> 02:42:39,644
entire wall, going up. You can't even see the
ceiling of the cavern, it's so high up from your

2561
02:42:39,644 --> 02:42:42,095
current perspective. It just disappears into
darkness.

2562
02:42:42,095 --> 02:42:49,048
You continue following the path until eventually
you come to this choke point here, where the land

2563
02:42:49,048 --> 02:42:53,525
mass begins to-- you can see where the beach
begins to crest down and touch the water.

2564
02:42:53,525 --> 02:43:01,186
As you slowly and quietly make your way around the
bend, you look over and you can see the forest.

2565
02:43:01,186 --> 02:43:05,125
Indeed, they appear to be trees, but now that you
have a better view of it, you know, maybe about

2566
02:43:05,125 --> 02:43:12,052
400, 500 feet off from you right now, that
bioluminescent glow, this very faint glow is given

2567
02:43:12,148 --> 02:43:18,845
off by all the plant life, all these giant fungal
trees. The roots have these strange, organic,

2568
02:43:18,845 --> 02:43:28,531
almost like they're gripping the ground. The
canopies of them blossom in these strange, almost

2569
02:43:28,531 --> 02:43:36,891
mushroom-like appendages, these fungal bursts that
stick off the top and form the tree-like canopy.

2570
02:43:36,891 --> 02:43:42,197
And you can see vines hanging from each of these.
It's a very strange, alien forest. Fauna that even

2571
02:43:42,197 --> 02:43:50,596
you're not familiar with in your travels. But it
does give off this dull color, this faint light

2572
02:43:50,596 --> 02:43:55,831
source that does tend to give a general visual
view of the landscape on this island.

2573
02:43:55,831 --> 02:44:02,813
You do see, just barely beyond this point, looking
across, the tops of a few buildings in the very,

2574
02:44:02,813 --> 02:44:11,496
very distance. The color of the stone, from what
you can make out, has almost a jade mixed with a

2575
02:44:11,496 --> 02:44:17,832
grey marble. And you can just faintly make off in
the distance one large pyramid-like structure that

2576
02:44:17,832 --> 02:44:22,141
comes to a flattened precipice on top.

2577
02:44:22,141 --> 02:44:23,766
LIAM: This is on the island?

2578
02:44:23,766 --> 02:44:28,874
MATT: On the island, to your left. And there is a
very, very faint greenish glow at the very top

2579
02:44:28,874 --> 02:44:34,708
that matches the coloration of that same glow you
saw in the eyes of Queen Ulara earlier and the

2580
02:44:34,708 --> 02:44:38,712
rest of the denizens that were in her party.

2581
02:44:38,712 --> 02:44:43,735
As you quietly begin to push along, you come to
the point where there's the beach to your right

2582
02:44:43,735 --> 02:44:48,706
and there's the island to the left. The island,
which comes to this incline and then drops off on

2583
02:44:48,706 --> 02:44:54,600
a cliff on the far side. It has its own
encapsulated fungal forest. You can see what looks

2584
02:44:54,600 --> 02:45:00,376
like a very, very faint bit of ruins on the
beachfront that has mostly crumbled and fallen.

2585
02:45:00,376 --> 02:45:07,783
But for the most part it appears to be fairly
empty, other than the fungal growth itself.

2586
02:45:07,783 --> 02:45:13,094
To the right there is another pebble beach, same
consistency as the beach you first arrived on.

2587
02:45:13,227 --> 02:45:16,351
LIAM: What's the scale. Are we talking Manhattan
and Brooklyn? Or smaller than that?

2588
02:45:16,351 --> 02:45:22,433
MATT: To put to scale, your boat that you found is
about that big.

2589
02:45:22,433 --> 02:45:24,341
LAURA: Oh, okay. So it's pretty big, then.

2590
02:45:24,341 --> 02:45:25,934
MATT: It's pretty big.

2591
02:45:25,934 --> 02:45:31,821
LAURA: Okay. Should we land on the beach and then
check out that little cave?

2592
02:45:31,821 --> 02:45:32,584
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2593
02:45:32,584 --> 02:45:33,982
TALIESIN: Yes, I think that's an excellent idea.

2594
02:45:33,982 --> 02:45:34,910
LIAM: We're all very curious.

2595
02:45:34,910 --> 02:45:35,909
LAURA: All right.

2596
02:45:35,909 --> 02:45:37,349
SAM: I'm not curious.

2597
02:45:37,349 --> 02:45:43,292
LAURA: As we're flying overhead, can I get a
better look at if there's anything on the beach?

2598
02:45:43,292 --> 02:45:46,946
MATT: Yeah, as you guys come gliding down, you
look at the beach. You see the ruins, you see,

2599
02:45:46,946 --> 02:45:55,545
even though there is no real breeze or wind in
this cold air, there is like a slight swaying.

2600
02:45:55,545 --> 02:45:57,193
LIAM: On the beach?

2601
02:45:57,193 --> 02:46:00,223
MATT: To the trees that reside on this.

2602
02:46:00,223 --> 02:46:03,035
LAURA: What about the little island-- the little
cave.

2603
02:46:03,035 --> 02:46:04,062
MATT: On here?

2604
02:46:04,062 --> 02:46:05,023
LAURA: Yeah.

2605
02:46:05,023 --> 02:46:09,437
MATT: Best you can see, looking down, it's just a
plain, pebble beach, an inlet there that goes into

2606
02:46:09,437 --> 02:46:11,541
the cavern interior of the wall.

2607
02:46:11,541 --> 02:46:12,947
TRAVIS: Let's get all up in that bad boy.

2608
02:46:12,947 --> 02:46:15,035
SAM: Go in the cave?

2609
02:46:15,035 --> 02:46:16,181
TRAVIS: There's treasure.

2610
02:46:16,181 --> 02:46:19,358
LAURA: Treasure! Pirates! Arr!

2611
02:46:19,358 --> 02:46:20,741
SAM: I already have a ruby. I'm fine.

2612
02:46:20,741 --> 02:46:23,731
MARISHA: I'll stay with the boat. As a shark.

2613
02:46:23,731 --> 02:46:26,010
LAURA: Do we fly in, Tiberius? And just go...

2614
02:46:26,010 --> 02:46:27,213
ORION: Absolutely.

2615
02:46:27,213 --> 02:46:30,691
LAURA: All right. Stealth and fly in. Can we do
that? Is that possible? To stealth and fly at the

2616
02:46:30,691 --> 02:46:32,138
same time?

2617
02:46:32,138 --> 02:46:36,406
MATT: You can certainly try to keep quiet while
doing so. The cave that actually opens up in the

2618
02:46:36,406 --> 02:46:43,959
side of the wall within this cavern is about 20
feet up and about 25 feet across. So you're flying

2619
02:46:44,091 --> 02:46:49,165
as low as you can, but you're still only about
maybe 15 feet off the ground. Ten to 15 feet. Are

2620
02:46:49,165 --> 02:46:51,234
the rest of you going in?

2621
02:46:51,234 --> 02:46:53,984
LIAM: Well, we're in the boat. But Grog and I want
to go. Right?

2622
02:46:53,984 --> 02:46:55,029
TRAVIS: Nope.

2623
02:46:55,029 --> 02:46:56,089
LIAM: No?

2624
02:46:56,089 --> 02:46:56,954
SAM: I'll come.

2625
02:46:56,954 --> 02:46:59,229
TRAVIS: I'm thinking it'll be a quick trip.

2626
02:46:59,229 --> 02:47:02,927
LIAM: Is the boat coming up to the beach?

2627
02:47:02,927 --> 02:47:03,855
TRAVIS: Yep.

2628
02:47:03,855 --> 02:47:10,237
LIAM: Yes. All right. I scoop up Scanlan and go
piggyback style, like he's my son, and jump on the

2629
02:47:10,237 --> 02:47:12,001
beach.

2630
02:47:12,001 --> 02:47:13,534
TALIESIN: I'll wait here.

2631
02:47:13,534 --> 02:47:15,829
MATT: All right. Everyone who's entering the
cavern, go ahead and make a stealth check.

2632
02:47:15,829 --> 02:47:21,126
MARISHA: Ooh! Pretty flashy.

2633
02:47:21,126 --> 02:47:22,936
SAM: Natural 20.

2634
02:47:22,936 --> 02:47:25,630
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

2635
02:47:25,630 --> 02:47:27,389
ORION: 13.

2636
02:47:27,389 --> 02:47:29,668
TALIESIN: I'm in the boat.

2637
02:47:29,668 --> 02:47:30,629
MATT: In the boat?

2638
02:47:30,629 --> 02:47:31,846
LAURA: 13.

2639
02:47:31,846 --> 02:47:33,078
TRAVIS: Six.

2640
02:47:33,078 --> 02:47:34,243
LIAM: 27.

2641
02:47:34,243 --> 02:47:35,259
MATT: All right.

2642
02:47:35,259 --> 02:47:36,225
ORION: Oh, we are on the carpet.

2643
02:47:36,225 --> 02:47:45,319
MATT: As you guys not-so-stealthily begin to march
into the tunnel here, you follow it as it bends

2644
02:47:45,319 --> 02:47:49,746
around a little bit and it eventually opens up
into this larger space. And as you enter the room,

2645
02:47:49,746 --> 02:47:57,133
partway through this tunnel, the scent changes
dramatically. That cold, still water smell begins

2646
02:47:57,133 --> 02:48:07,206
to give way to this terrible, sulfurous, rotting
smell. Very-- it's near septic.

2647
02:48:07,206 --> 02:48:17,041
And as you enter this room, the smell is dreadful,
and you can tell, using your light source over

2648
02:48:17,041 --> 02:48:23,980
here, there appears to have been some sort of a
struggle. There are bedrolls and sheets strewn

2649
02:48:23,980 --> 02:48:29,460
about and soiled and burned and torn across the
floor. There's about what looks like three or four

2650
02:48:29,460 --> 02:48:34,815
different bedspreads that have been tossed and
ruined. You can see a semblance of what was a fire

2651
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:39,645
pit, but all the soot and ash has been smeared
across the ground to the outside of it. There

2652
02:48:39,645 --> 02:48:46,550
appears to be a half buried chest or container off
in the far corner. And you can see what looks to

2653
02:48:46,550 --> 02:48:56,662
be four dead bodies, in a not too long state of
decay. You can still see flesh and skin, but

2654
02:48:56,662 --> 02:49:00,269
there's some bone peeking through, and they're all
slumped against the ground, against the corners.

2655
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:02,001
SAM: Vax, why don't you go mess with them?

2656
02:49:02,001 --> 02:49:04,045
LIAM: I'm going to use perception on the chest and
the bodies.

2657
02:49:04,045 --> 02:49:06,097
MATT: Okay.

2658
02:49:06,097 --> 02:49:10,346
LIAM: That is not that good. That is 13.

2659
02:49:10,534 --> 02:49:16,621
ORION: I'm going to use my earring of
whisper right now. "There's some fun things in

2660
02:49:16,733 --> 02:49:20,685
"here. Grog, you're not wearing it. Someone tell
Grog he might need to kill something."

2661
02:49:20,685 --> 02:49:23,853
LAURA: This looks a little dangerous.

2662
02:49:23,853 --> 02:49:24,938
TALIESIN: All right.

2663
02:49:24,938 --> 02:49:25,885
TRAVIS: We're killing something?

2664
02:49:25,885 --> 02:49:26,665
LAURA: Be ready to run.

2665
02:49:26,665 --> 02:49:27,763
TRAVIS: I come running in.

2666
02:49:27,763 --> 02:49:31,737
LIAM: I'm back from the chest. I take out one
dagger and throw it at the chest to sink it into

2667
02:49:31,737 --> 02:49:36,885
the lid. From a ways back.

2668
02:49:36,885 --> 02:49:41,499
MATT: You take the dagger and (sound of dagger
embedding into wood) into the wood. Doesn't seem

2669
02:49:41,499 --> 02:49:43,626
to have any immediate effect.

2670
02:49:43,626 --> 02:49:50,404
LIAM: Okay, so I did a 13 perception check, I
guess on the chest, so I'll go to try and open it.

2671
02:49:50,404 --> 02:49:51,686
MATT: Okay.

2672
02:49:51,686 --> 02:49:52,915
LAURA: Oh god.

2673
02:49:52,915 --> 02:49:54,379
TRAVIS: Has anybody run to the back of the cave
yet?

2674
02:49:54,379 --> 02:49:56,053
SAM: Are we all in the cave?

2675
02:49:56,053 --> 02:49:57,147
LAURA: We're on the carpet.

2676
02:49:57,147 --> 02:49:58,933
LIAM: You're on my back, Scanlan.

2677
02:49:58,987 --> 02:50:01,049
MATT: Grog and Percy are still in the boat, at
this point.

2678
02:50:01,049 --> 02:50:02,038
TALIESIN: But we're listening in.

2679
02:50:02,038 --> 02:50:03,323
MARISHA: Grog's running in.

2680
02:50:03,323 --> 02:50:04,441
TRAVIS: I come running in.

2681
02:50:04,441 --> 02:50:09,289
MATT: Well, you're in the process of stepping out
of the boat at this point. As you begin to

2682
02:50:09,289 --> 02:50:18,039
approach the chest, you notice one of the bodies
shift. (moans) Its head rolls around and it looks

2683
02:50:18,039 --> 02:50:19,060
at you.

2684
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:20,335
LIAM: Pike?

2685
02:50:20,335 --> 02:50:25,040
MATT: Pike is still back in the boat with Percy.
"What?" She doesn't have one of the earpieces.

2686
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,694
LIAM: Someone call Pike?

2687
02:50:26,694 --> 02:50:28,299
LAURA: Percy, undead!

2688
02:50:28,299 --> 02:50:31,046
TALIESIN: All right, we're on our way. Pike, come
on.

2689
02:50:31,046 --> 02:50:35,838
MATT: All right. As you guys get out of the boat
and begin rushing in that direction, you notice

2690
02:50:35,838 --> 02:50:42,410
the one body looking over at you with this weird
grin. You've had a few encounters with zombies or

2691
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:49,001
undead creatures that unnaturally move. This one
has an intelligence to it that disturbs you. You

2692
02:50:49,001 --> 02:50:52,921
glance over at the other bodies, who are already
getting to their feet.

2693
02:50:52,921 --> 02:50:54,891
ORION: Where are the bodies located?

2694
02:50:54,891 --> 02:50:58,941
MATT: We will get to that at the top of our next
session.

2695
02:50:58,941 --> 02:51:00,557
(all groan)

2696
02:51:00,557 --> 02:51:02,080
LAURA: Oh no!

2697
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,038
LIAM: Oh, nuts!

2698
02:51:03,038 --> 02:51:04,311
TRAVIS: No killing.

2699
02:51:04,311 --> 02:51:09,090
LAURA: We're pirates! (growls)

2700
02:51:09,090 --> 02:51:10,589
MARISHA: I'm a shark, still.

2701
02:51:10,589 --> 02:51:11,564
MATT: Yep.

2702
02:51:11,564 --> 02:51:12,634
LIAM: Come back, Ashley!

2703
02:51:12,634 --> 02:51:14,543
LAURA: Help us, Ashley!

2704
02:51:14,543 --> 02:51:16,300
TALIESIN: Grog, you could throw a shark at
something.

2705
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:18,333
MARISHA: Can you?

2706
02:51:18,333 --> 02:51:21,920
TALIESIN: You can toss a shark at a zombie.

2707
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:23,441
LIAM: You could use the shark like a baseball
bat.

2708
02:51:23,441 --> 02:51:27,853
TALIESIN: You could battering-ram a zombie with
the shark and just go.

2709
02:51:27,853 --> 02:51:34,187
ORION: Sharks don't die as soon as they get out of
the water. You can last a couple minutes out of

2710
02:51:34,187 --> 02:51:35,216
the water if you're a fish.

2711
02:51:35,216 --> 02:51:36,721
TALIESIN: They have sandpaper skin.

2712
02:51:36,721 --> 02:51:41,372
MATT: So! (laughs) So we will pick up next week
with the next episode of Critical Role, in which

2713
02:51:41,372 --> 02:51:49,216
the party will deal with this sudden surrounding
of some strange, partially-decomposed corpses.

2714
02:51:49,216 --> 02:51:50,863
LIAM: It's the undead!

2715
02:51:50,863 --> 02:51:52,300
MATT: Indeed, the overlord has come!

2716
02:51:52,300 --> 02:51:56,765
ZAC: Hey, guys!

2717
02:51:56,765 --> 02:51:58,537
(all yay, cheer)

2718
02:51:58,537 --> 02:51:59,712
ORION: What's up, Zac?

2719
02:51:59,712 --> 02:52:07,412
ZAC: Good job tonight, everybody. So, I just want
to do one more shout-out to those t-shirts. Scroll

2720
02:52:07,412 --> 02:52:17,368
down, buy some shirts. We have two weeks to sell
1,000 of them. This, to be totally honest, is to

2721
02:52:17,368 --> 02:52:23,942
prove to the powers that be that Twitch is a
viable resource for income (laughing weakly),

2722
02:52:23,942 --> 02:52:25,375
woo!

2723
02:52:25,375 --> 02:52:26,531
ORION: And good entertainment, good
entertainment.

2724
02:52:26,531 --> 02:52:27,494
ZAC: Great entertainment.

2725
02:52:27,494 --> 02:52:30,907
LIAM: We all know this is going to grow, so we're
just getting ahead of the game.

2726
02:52:30,907 --> 02:52:32,921
ORION: Much like Scanlan's penis.

2727
02:52:32,921 --> 02:52:37,128
LAURA: Enough with the dick jokes.

2728
02:52:37,128 --> 02:52:39,017
MATT: About that.

2729
02:52:39,017 --> 02:52:41,644
ZAC: So, do you guys want to read all these
messages?

2730
02:52:41,644 --> 02:52:43,251
MATT: Yes, I'd love to!

2731
02:52:43,251 --> 02:52:45,211
ZAC: So, we had quite a few donations tonight.

2732
02:52:45,211 --> 02:52:46,125
LIAM: Yes!

2733
02:52:46,125 --> 02:52:46,993
LAURA: We did?

2734
02:52:46,993 --> 02:52:48,332
ZAC: We did.

2735
02:52:48,332 --> 02:52:49,698
MARISHA: Yes and, we broke PayPal.

2736
02:52:49,698 --> 02:52:51,646
MATT: I can charge through these real fast.

2737
02:52:51,646 --> 02:52:53,125
ZAC: I might let you, yeah. Phew!

2738
02:52:53,125 --> 02:52:55,709
MATT: I can do that. All right, starting here with
Vorath. "Another donation this week to this

2739
02:52:55,709 --> 02:53:00,659

2741
02:53:04,247 --> 02:53:09,833
All right, we have Nadoprime. "I just discovered
this show a week ago I'm now a subscriber?" Aw.

2742
02:53:09,833 --> 02:53:14,206
"And I'm pledging to give five dollars every week
that I watch." Well, thank you so much, Nadoprime!

2743
02:53:14,206 --> 02:53:15,807
It's great.

2744
02:53:15,807 --> 02:53:20,716
We've got Lipoolflinger. "This is awesome. High
fives all around. Please keep going." We shall!

2745
02:53:20,716 --> 02:53:23,345
This isn't ending any time soon.

2746
02:53:23,345 --> 02:53:27,989
Unwriteable, gave us a $70 donation. Thank you,
Unwriteable. That's amazing.

2747

Panobo! "Hi from Mexico, gran juego, viva el D&D."
There we go. I've been talking all night, sorry.

Matt Abernathy! Thank you so much! Great designs,

2754
02:54:08,204 --> 02:54:13,504
too. Keep them coming. We're hoping to do some
stuff with fan designs in the near future, so

MARISHA: Save Grog!

2760
02:54:28,527 --> 02:54:34,685
MATT: Oh, MauhiduL, who I met on the Minecraft
server the other day, which was amazing! If you

2761
02:54:34,685 --> 02:54:40,432
guys haven't been on the Geek & Sundry Minecraft
server. They've actually recreated physically,

2762
02:54:40,432 --> 02:54:45,739
sequences from our campaign, like battlegrounds,
and it's like walking through--

2763
02:54:45,739 --> 02:54:51,674
MARISHA: It's like a walkthrough! Yeah, actually,
if you want a good, creative summary thus far, you

2764
02:54:51,674 --> 02:54:53,355
can walk through this.

2765
02:54:53,355 --> 02:54:54,902
MATT: I got emotional walking through it

2766

MARISHA: I know. I got all teary-eyed!

2767

TALIESIN: The pictures you were sending were
amazing.

pictures.

emotional, too.
