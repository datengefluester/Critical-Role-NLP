00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:10,616
actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
First and foremost, we are super excited that we

3
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:14,344
actually have in the flesh here with us tonight
the wonderful Ashley Johnson!

4
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:17,302
(cheering)

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:18,709
ASHLEY: So glad.

6
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,158
MATT: We missed you so much.

7
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:22,509
ASHLEY: I missed you. Everybody.

8
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,328
LIAM: You are not allowed to go.

9
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,722
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to put her in a locked
room.

10
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:28,849
ASHLEY: I'd be okay with it.

11
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,492
LIAM: You'll eat your rice and play Dungeons and
Dragons.

12
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:39,592
MATT: I'm glad you could join us here for this.
All right, so next up I believe, Laura, we have

13
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:43,368
some new merch? Apparently, which I forgot about
until you showed me before the show.

14
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:50,704
LAURA: I was just showing this off before the
stream. We have this amazing Matthew Mercer shirt.

15
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:53,890
(cheering)

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,289
LAURA: It's kind of wrinkly because I was sitting
on it but...

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:01,702
MATT: I have a shirt.

18
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:05,007
LAURA: So hey, that's in the store. That's in the
store right now.

19
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,850
TRAVIS: It's got the logo on the back too.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,708
ASHLEY: You have a t-shirt.

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:17,052
LAURA: And it's subtle, I like that anybody that
doesn't know what it is would just think it's a

22
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:20,897
cool silhouette shirt. And then anybody that does
know what it is, it's like they're "in."

23
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:23,491
TRAVIS: Is that the kind DM shirt, or is that the
evil sarcastic--

24
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:26,820
LAURA: He's smirking evilly. It's an evil smirk.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,667
LIAM: You know the meme, when the dungeon master
smiles, it's too late.

26
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:36,700
MATT: Exactly. I really like it. I think it's
inspired reminiscent of another project I work on.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,655
And it makes me happy.

28
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,296
LAURA: That's what inspired us to do it.

29
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:44,102
LIAM: By the time he's smiling, you're already
getting choked out.

30
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:54,634
MATT: Good times. Next up, just a reminder, we have
the Critical Role Vox Machina Origins comic book

31
00:01:54,634 --> 00:02:00,716
available on Comixology, on Dark Horse.
Apparently, where it is at now?

32
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:06,635
LIAM: It's the second highest rated comic book on
Comixology at the moment.

33
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:08,579
LAURA: Because Critters are awesome.

34
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,498
TALIESIN: Sitting at nine on the current
bestseller list.

35
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,721
LAURA: Of all time?

36
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:14,878
SAM: Of all time.

37
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,364
LIAM: On Comixology.

38
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:19,979
MARISHA: We have the best fans.

39
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,480
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty much.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,682
TALIESIN: It's a good book!

41
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:25,446
MARISHA: It's so good.

42
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,141
MATT: Next one is coming soon.

43
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:30,016
LIAM: We saw it.

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,065
MATT: Excited for you guys.

45
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:35,515
TALIESIN: It's got so much.

46
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:42,803
MATT: We'll have information soon on when the next
comic comes out next month. Don't forget we have

47
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:47,990
Talks Machina next Tuesday to discuss this
episode. Next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific with our

48
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:54,961
fantastic host Brian Foster to discuss
Travis' third testicle.

49
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:58,799
TALIESIN: Oh, they found out about that.

50
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,258
MATT: Yeah. It's on the list here. Also, don't
forget it's the last week of September so if you

51
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:09,429
haven't had a chance yet and you always wanted to
go ahead and join the Geek and Sundry Twitch

52
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:14,598
community and subscribe, or any other Twitch
community that you've been waiting for, they're

53
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,879
half off this month. So now's the time to jump in.
Laura and Travis, you're going to be at a

54
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,870
convention in Atlanta this weekend.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,016
LAURA: Why yes, we leave tomorrow morning
actually.

56
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:29,159
TRAVIS: Bright and early, Anime Weekend Atlanta.
We're there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, come down,

57
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,533
see us and throw things in our face. That'd be
great.

58
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:40,013
LAURA: And we're also going to be in Australia in
a couple weeks, or this November.

59
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:47,626
SAM: Ashley, what's going on with you? Anything to
plug? Any other projects that you're working on?

60
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,609
LAURA: Are you working on any kind of shows or
anything?

61
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,947
MARISHA: Yeah, it seems like you've been so busy.

62
00:03:51,947 --> 00:04:01,196
ASHLEY: I just didn't want to come. I've just got
other things to do. Shop online. I'm just busy,

63
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:06,700
guys. Looking at Cute Emergency on Twitter,
there's just so many more important things to do

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,200
than this. Just kidding, that's not true.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,652
MARISHA: You do retweet Cute Emergency quite a
lot.

66
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,270
TALIESIN: You're how I found Cute Emergency.

67
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,283
ASHLEY: Oh really? That makes me so glad. We love
aminals.

68
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:28,838
MATT: All righty. Well then, without further ado.
Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of

69
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,916
Critical Role.

70
00:04:30,916 --> 00:06:01,622
[dramatic music]

71
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,139
LIAM: --me, daddy.

72
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,508
MATT: Little late on the draw there, bud.

73
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,744
MARISHA: Like, unfashionably late.

74
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,819
LIAM: What an accident that was. Oh no!

75
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:22,647
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off, Vox
Machina had made their way through the innards of

76
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:31,230
the undead risen primordial earth titan. On its
shoulders was held the long-abandoned until

77
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,434
recently city of Thar Amphala, from the
Shadowfell. A city that once held the armies of

78
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:44,880
Vecna, the Undying King who has since risen once
more, and achieved godhood in recent days.

79
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,025
You traversed to this titan, through its innards
up into the city of Thar Amphala; which you notice

80
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:58,978
the outer wall currently manages to maintain an
arcane dome that holds at bay any of the outward

81
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:05,492
assailing forces of the wyvern riders or Devo'ssa,
the brass dragon. Where the inside of it contains,

82
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:13,691
in wait, a cloud of various gloomstalkers and a
skeletal dragon that just peruse the city in

83
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:21,443
safety as you make your way through the streets in
search of the recently reassembled and standing

84
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,801
tower of Entropis.

85
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:33,744
Now upon seeking a sword that you were notified had
historical binds to the hatred of Vecna and hopefully

86
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:43,375
his downfall, the Sword of Kas, you went seeking
this weapon, long ago discarded and bound within a

87
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:51,565
buried catacomb within a pit of acid along with
various corpses left over from an ancient war. And

88
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:58,551
in doing so, unfortunately notified Vecna of your
arrival. As Vex passed through into the ethereal

89
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:06,732
plane, the ring that kept any sort of scrying at
bay was lost. And both Vax and Keyleth came to his

90
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:14,243
attention. All of you managed to flee back to
Scanlan's mansion where the rest were in wait.

91
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:19,177
However, with a notification fresh at hand, the
skeletal dragon swooped into the chamber where the

92
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:27,637
mansion was set, on its back riding Lady
Delilah Briarwood and the re-risen Sylas

93
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,103
Briarwood.

94
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:38,471
The mansion was dispelled, you were exited from
the pocket plane and barely maneuvering, due to

95
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:45,495
a very lucky roll, having your Plane Shift
dispelled you made your way into the Feywild as a

96
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:52,116
Hail Mary. And through a dick-drawing, made
contact with the one archfey that you had

97
00:08:52,116 --> 00:09:02,426
encountered in your previous journeys, Artagan.
Upon being summoned, and your knowledge of the

98
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:06,808
strange time-altering nature of exiting the
Feywild, you asked if it was within his power to

99
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:15,133
ensure the condensing of the time passage when you
were to return. He agreed, under two conditions.

100
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:20,193
One, when this was all said and done, you would
help him assemble a doorway in the Prime Material

101
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:30,451
Plane, in which he could visit your space. And
two, upon realizing that Vax was of some undying

102
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:42,496
or re-rising nature, wished to strangle him until
dead. You agreed, and shortly thereafter Vax

103
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:48,812
expired into ashes and you all spent time awaiting
his return.

104
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:53,383
We've left off with the return of Vax, but if
there's anything you wanted to do over that

105
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:57,585
period of time before his arrival, now would be
the time to do it.

106
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,390
SAM: Before his arrival?

107
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,670
TRAVIS: When he walks back.

108
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:09,654
LAURA: So that we can do some spells that will be
in effect for a day. Potentially.

109
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,255
SAM: But he takes a while to come back.

110
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,785
MATT: It takes a little while, yeah.

111
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,504
LAURA: So we should do some of our spells right
before we go to sleep.

112
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:20,932
SAM: Yeah, for sure. Is that now?

113
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,323
LAURA: I don't know!

114
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,780
SAM: Is sleep now?

115
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,408
MATT: That's up to you.

116
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:29,181
LAURA: We do need to do Heroes' Feast. I have one
chalice left.

117
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:33,025
ASHLEY: But then Vax won't be in the--

118
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,011
LAURA: Unless we leave him a plate.

119
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:39,739
MATT: Well, the meal appears for a short time.

120
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,912
LAURA: Then we need to do that right when he gets
back.

121
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,327
MARISHA: Right before we sleep?

122
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,521
LAURA: Yeah, hopefully he'll be back before--

123
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,319
SAM: We'll wait a few hours.

124
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,534
LAURA: We'll wait a few hours to see if he shows
up and then we'll cast it to see because we need

125
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,791
time to be able to do it.

126
00:10:52,791 --> 00:11:02,965
MATT: We'll say for the truncating of the wait
period that eight hours go by, 12 hours go by,

127
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:07,749
it's hard to tell time in the Feywild, since it
doesn't have a day-night cycle, it's always on the

128
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:14,524
cusp of sunset. And the longer you wait, and the
more the boredom sets in, the more the stress of

129
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:21,156
the coming fray creeps into the back of your mind,
you find that it seems like far too much time has

130
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:27,257
passed and you begin to worry, you begin to
twitch, you begin to do search parties around the

131
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:33,176
surrounding forest, the possibility that he
returned and got lost. You don't know how much

132
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:39,426
time has passed until you convene to desperately
ask if there was any possible sight, and at that

133
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:45,584
point you hear the snapping of foliage beneath a
distant foot, and you all turn and by the nearby

134
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:54,274
tree you see entering the pale, nude, long
dark-haired body of Vax returned in his revenant

135
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,374
form for a second time.

136
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,186
TRAVIS: Yep, that's him.

137
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:03,349
LIAM: That was a thing. Does anyone have my
clothing?

138
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,386
LAURA: Yes.

139
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:10,961
TRAVIS: No, they took it and ran, it was part of
the penance. We fought bravely. It's buck naked

140
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,150
from here on out.

141
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,148
LIAM: That's going to make tomorrow a little
squirrely.

142
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:20,826
MARISHA: Scanlan awkwardly put it in a weird druid
circle rock thing, it's over there.

143
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,282
SAM: We were protecting it for you.

144
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:26,195
MARISHA: He doesn't know how to do druid circles
really right.

145
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:33,295
SAM: The goddess Ioun told me to protect it in a
circle reminiscent of the circle of my third eye.

146
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,160
MARISHA: (whispering) I don't think he's telling
the truth.

147
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,864
LIAM: Do you have all my shoes and glasses so I
may have them?

148
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:40,330
SAM: As Ioun wills it, yes.

149
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,671
LIAM: Okay, could you lead me and my penis towards
them now?

150
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:48,221
SAM: Ioun be pleased, I will.

151
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:54,617
LIAM: We're still standing here. It's getting
awkward.

152
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:58,781
SAM: I'm a holy man. It's supposed to be awkward.

153
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:01,449
LAURA: I'm going to start the Heroes' Feast, I'm
just going to get the chalice.

154
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,360
TALIESIN: I'll help with that, that sounds like a
great use of time and not watching this.

155
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,276
TRAVIS: I have a question. Should we ask the Sword
of Kas, since it's fought Vecna before, does it

156
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,717
know of any weaknesses?

157
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,955
LAURA: That's actually really smart. Wow, that's
really smart, Grog!

158
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:19,543
ASHLEY: Oh good idea.

159
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:22,634
TALIESIN: Don't think too hard about it.

160
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:28,757
SAM: We can't hear him so you'll have to talk.
Hello?

161
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:30,338
TRAVIS: Sorry.

162
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:32,219
LAURA: That took a lot out of you.

163
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:33,569
TRAVIS: I need to sit.

164
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:38,401
TALIESIN: Grog, I have an idea. Why don't you ask
the sword if it has any idea of Vecna's

165
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,040
weaknesses?

166
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,579
TRAVIS: (gasp) That's a good idea Percy!

167
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:43,767
TALIESIN: I'm so glad I had it.

168
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:47,970
TRAVIS: Oh my god, yes. Wait, wait, if I pull it
out of the sheath to talk to it-- can I talk to it

169
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,292
through the sheath?

170
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,789
MATT: You probably have to draw it.

171
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,142
TRAVIS: I might have to draw it and then it's
going to need the (glugging).

172
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,281
LAURA: Here.

173
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,401
TRAVIS: You?!

174
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,646
LAURA: You can cut me.

175
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:59,834
TRAVIS: Look, listen, I made a promise to your
brother, he was very adamant that I'm supposed to

176
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:00,833
stick it--

177
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,182
TALIESIN: I'll take it. It's my turn.

178
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,792
SAM: Percy, what a tough thing for you to do.

179
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:10,698
TRAVIS: Do you want just a hand slice or do you
want to up the ante and I stick it in your thigh?

180
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:16,827
I do have to bathe it, it has to be quite a
coating.

181
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:21,077
LAURA: Just do it, we'll heal him up.

182
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:28,287
TRAVIS: Okay, cool, come on Percy. Buy the ticket,
baby! So can I unsheathe Kas?

183
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:35,442
MATT: As you pull the blade out, there's a very
silent glass against textured metal sound. The

184
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:44,228
blade is so dark that barely any of the light
seems to come across it. Where the blade is, up

185
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:48,948
close, you can barely make out the outside of it,
but as soon as you draw it the voice goes,

186
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:50,575
"Hungry."

187
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,489
TALIESIN: All right, just on the count of three.

188
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:59,103
TRAVIS: Do I get to pick where? Okay. I reach
around to the back of his knee and I pull along there.

189
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:06,872
LAURA: Back of his knee?! Are you trying to take
him out of commission for future fights? That's

190
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,327
really terrible.

191
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,909
TALIESIN: I said yes.

192
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,209
LAURA: I want to cast Cure Wounds at third level on
Percy.

193
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:20,534
TRAVIS: Yeah, when you shave your legs the back of
your knee is the tricky part, right?

194
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:23,354
TALIESIN: It's just so I can swim faster, that was
not for you to advertise.

195
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:31,632
MATT: As you deal with the nearly hamstrung self
that is your right knee, the sword is coated well

196
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:37,814
enough in Percival blood as it seeps into the
darkened blade, and the voice goes "Ah, yes."

197
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:46,293
TRAVIS: Respectfully, Kas, I had a few questions
because I am on board to satisfy your maniacal

198
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:53,907
desires to fuck up Vecna and all that he stands
for, right? Oh no, Kas?

199
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,283
MATT: "Yes?"

200
00:15:55,283 --> 00:16:01,899
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god. Might need more blood soon.
Do you know of any weaknesses that Vecna has, or

201
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,091
opportunities that we could explite?

202
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:16,828
MATT: "He is more intelligent than most, but his
arrogance gets the best of him. He likes a show."

203
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:25,714
TRAVIS: Apparently he's really smart, and is
arro-- aromatic.

204
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:30,646
LAURA: He smells?

205
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,539
MARISHA: Enigmatic?

206
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,703
LIAM: Acrobatic.

207
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,042
MARISHA: What does he mean?

208
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,738
TRAVIS: He likes to put on a show, I think.

209
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:38,464
LAURA: He likes to put on a show.

210
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,446
TRAVIS: Yeah.

211
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:44,943
MATT: "He builds webs of plots, so many things
intertwined."

212
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:49,338
TRAVIS: Doesn't make much sense, apparently he
builds whips out of plots.

213
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:53,877
MATT: "Cut the threads, and the web can falter."

214
00:16:53,877 --> 00:17:00,162
TRAVIS: Oh right, he strings things together like
a web, you know, like a dog makes.

215
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,290
LAURA: Oh that's smart, okay.

216
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:10,718
MATT: "I can cut these threads, bring me to these
threads, bring me to him, I must cut him down,

217
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:12,696
"now, now."

218
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:16,422
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh god, he's really adamant about
cutting the webs.

219
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:18,696
SAM: He's a sword, he cuts, that's his thing.

220
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,131
MARISHA: Wait, cutting webs?

221
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:25,969
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess Vecna has spider abilities.
Pro-tip.

222
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:29,685
LAURA: Okay. That's interesting, we didn't notice
that before.

223
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:38,135
TRAVIS: Any physical weaknesses, or things that he
is vulnerable to that we should know?

224
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,336
MATT: "Me."

225
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:43,024
TRAVIS: Him, okay, cool, I think we've got
everything.

226
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:46,940
MARISHA: He's vulnerable to-- oh, to--

227
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,463
TRAVIS: To him.

228
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,195
MARISHA: Got it, I got what they got.

229
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:54,621
TRAVIS: All right, next time I pull you out in the
light it will probably be to kill Vecna or someone

230
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:55,816
that I don't like.

231
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,954
MATT: As you put it away you hear a (sigh).

232
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,956
TALIESIN: You're actually going to pull that sword
out and it will have committed suicide.

233
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,778
TRAVIS: How's your knee, is it okay?

234
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:07,714
TALIESIN: It's feeling much better, thank you.

235
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:14,653
LIAM: Should we maybe talk out our plan for the
moment?

236
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:19,651
SAM: Sure. That sounds fun.

237
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:25,578
LIAM: No it doesn't, but I do think we should
probably have at it. We've got the trammels,

238
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,413
Grog's got them.

239
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:30,379
LAURA: So Sylas is back.

240
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,506
MARISHA: Along with Delilah. That's fun.

241
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,715
LAURA: So my blessing, from Pelor.

242
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:41,240
MARISHA: Hashtag blessed.

243
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,933
LAURA: Hashtag blessed. Gives radiant damage to
anything evil that attacks me with a spell. That's

244
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:57,016
pretty neat, huh? I have a feeling radiant damage
is going to be really important in this fight.

245
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:01,655
MARISHA: I recently was able to attune to this
armor that I haven't been able to attune to for a

246
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,757
long time and now I'm resistant to spells. So
that's good.

247
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:05,943
LAURA: What?

248
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,040
MARISHA: Yes.

249
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,329
LAURA: You've just been wearing it and it's not
done anything?

250
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:13,735
MARISHA: Kind of. Well I had to attune to my ring
and my antlers, and then I got the staff, so I let

251
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,851
that go, but now I just wore it for long enough.

252
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,276
LIAM: What are your three attuned right now?

253
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:28,749
MARISHA: I have four, because I took a feat when I
leveled up. Yeah that's pretty dope.

254
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,937
TRAVIS: I got a whole bunch of more hit points.

255
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,499
SAM: What's a hit point?

256
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:37,673
TRAVIS: It's like, I don't know. But I was
thinking, I have all three trammels, right, and I

257
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:43,664
need to get real close to do anything to Vecna. Is
it stupid for me to have all of them?

258
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:49,643
LIAM: Yes it is, we need to spread those out. We
need to decide who is doing what, at least what we

259
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:52,043
think is going to happen. I think I should take
one of the trammels.

260
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:53,789
LAURA: You're speedy, of course.

261
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:59,217
MARISHA: And I think it's smart if Pike and I
dedicate a decent amount of our spell power to

262
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,532
Freedom of Movement right before we go in.

263
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,264
TALIESIN: That won't be necessary for me but for
the rest of you.

264
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,230
TRAVIS: So we don't get paralyzed.

265
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,723
SAM: If Vax has a trammel, and Grog has a trammel,
who has the third trammel?

266
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:11,975
LIAM: One of these two.

267
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,321
LAURA: I could do it.

268
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,958
SAM: Someone who can fly. You can fly.

269
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,737
LAURA: I have a broom after all. But Pike can fly
now too.

270
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:20,024
SAM: Don't you have to be super strong to use
these trammels?

271
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,418
MARISHA: Pike is super strong, she's a monstah!

272
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:26,367
SAM: No, I'm fine with that. Can she fly?

273
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,857
LAURA: She can fly.

274
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,082
ASHLEY: I can now.

275
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,211
SAM: How?

276
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:34,846
ASHLEY: Well it's for ten minutes.

277
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,438
SAM: That's all we'll need.

278
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,220
LAURA: Ten minutes is a long time if it's right at
the beginning of the fight.

279
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,172
SAM: But that's when we'll need to use the
trammels.

280
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,265
MATT: Giant wings.

281
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:47,274
LAURA: It's pretty tight. Oh my god you can
fucking fly!

282
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,536
TRAVIS: I reach over to Pike, I spin her around,
are there any wings on the back?

283
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,667
MATT: No.

284
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,586
ASHLEY: I don't know where they are!

285
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,717
TRAVIS: I don't know how to break this to you.
They're not there yet.

286
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,365
SAM: Sometimes they're on the ankles.

287
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:00,928
TRAVIS: I turn her upside down, look at her feet.

288
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,239
MATT: No wings.

289
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:07,825
TRAVIS: I turn her back. Just keep wishing, they'll
grow in. Okay.

290
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,501
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you, Grog.

291
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:15,837
LAURA: So do you think you're stronger, and you're
more proficient with actual melee weapons, right?

292
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:18,719
Because I don't think I can shoot a trammel from
my bow.

293
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:26,235
ASHLEY: I feel like I'd be pretty proficient
because it takes the strength to do it? I've got it.

294
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:35,964
LAURA: Okay, let's have Pike hold the other one.
So Pike, you're the third. And we have to protect

295
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:37,029
our cleric.

296
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,656
SAM: What are all of us doing? I'm praying into a
book.

297
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:41,107
LAURA: Fighting.

298
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,145
SAM: Sure.

299
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:48,464
MATT: To give you a mechanical idea, based on what
Ioun had notified you, the more damaged Vecna's

300
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:53,025
avatar form is, the lower the DC to drive a
trammel into the body.

301
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:56,780
LAURA: Oh, so we got to bloody him up and then--

302
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,878
MATT: Possibly. Or roll really high early on, the
choice is up to you, that is the risk you have to take.

303
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:04,771
LAURA: We don't know, if we try it with the
trammel and it doesn't work, it doesn't break the

304
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,557
trammel, we just have to try again?

305
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:10,925
MATT: You have two strong and one fragile trammel
in your midst.

306
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,886
LAURA: Oh wait, who's holding the fragile one?

307
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:13,840
LIAM: I am.

308
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,249
LAURA: You're holding the fragile one.

309
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:20,119
MARISHA: Okay, so save that one for when he's real
fucked up. Percy and I had a thought for Grog.

310
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,445
TRAVIS: Thank god, because I don't have any
more.

311
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:31,789
MARISHA: If you borrow Percy's Spider-Climbing
boots I can maybe make some pillars to add for

312
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:39,272
cover for some of us more rangey people, but then
if I add pillars of different heights you can

313
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:40,961
climb up them.

314
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,490
TRAVIS: Do I have to attune to them?

315
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,752
TALIESIN: No.

316
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:46,468
TRAVIS: Does my speed translate to going up things
as well?

317
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,837
MATT: Oh yeah.

318
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:50,310
TALIESIN: I don't know what boots you have right
now.

319
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,067
TRAVIS: I have the Feral Leaping boots.

320
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:56,440
TALIESIN: Would you rather just run like
Spider-Man? Up to you.

321
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,609
TRAVIS: If he's more than 20 feet in the air, I'm
fucked.

322
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:06,191
SAM: How can we get Grog to fly, though? Because
these pillars can't go all the way to the heavens,

323
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,313
can they?

324
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:11,982
MARISHA: I mean I could Shapechange into something
and give him a mount, he can ride me.

325
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:14,287
LIAM: What about you Scanlan?

326
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,757
LAURA: Can you still cast if you're a dragon or
something?

327
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:23,363
MARISHA: I can cast in Beast Shape, Shapechange is
a spell, so if I'm a dragon, beholder, that's what

328
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:24,886
you get.

329
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:28,232
MATT: If the creature you transform into has
spells you can use those spells, but that's the

330
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,569
only circumstance.

331
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,659
LAURA: There's coffee all over it.

332
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,063
TALIESIN: Yes there is, there's coffee on
everything there.

333
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:39,968
MARISHA: Your dice tray dried nicely, though.

334
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:43,002
TALIESIN: I think it actually has a little bit of
nice character. Look at that.

335
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:46,441
MATT: A testament to Wyrmwood's craftsmanship.
Critrole!

336
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:50,984
LAURA: This got put in the dishwasher, and the
leather got cooler after it got put in the

337
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,104
dishwasher.

338
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,427
MATT: Anyway you guys.

339
00:23:53,427 --> 00:24:01,654
SAM: No no, we're focused. I guess we could use
these pillars, but it seems like a waste of your

340
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:05,550
spell to get him halfway up towards Vecna, if
Vecna is flying.

341
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:12,034
LAURA: The thing is if you're flying you can get
knocked off, I've been there, and then it's super

342
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,018
bad, so actually the pillars are really wonderful
in that regard.

343
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,201
SAM: If he's straight above us.

344
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:20,596
MARISHA: Well I can do six of them, I can do a lot
of pillars.

345
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:26,098
LAURA: He could be off of the tower, yes, and then
it's all ranged attacks, that's what we have.

346
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:30,297
SAM: All right, no plan.

347
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:35,553
TALIESIN: The plans are easy, the magic users are
going to be attacking Vecna with all they're worth.

348
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:38,782
LAURA: Hopefully we'll be able to take out the
Briarwoods before the fight.

349
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:44,462
MARISHA: I can cause up to six pillars, each
pillar is a cylinder five feet wide and up to 30

350
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:47,637
feet high, and can do six of them.

351
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,393
SAM: Can you do them on top of each other?

352
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:53,099
MARISHA: Well, he wasn't that much more than 30
feet last time.

353
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,854
LAURA: He was above us, but if he goes off of the
tower.

354
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:57,996
LIAM: I was about 50 or 60 feet in the air and I
was above him.

355
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:03,035
MARISHA: If I get Grog 30 feet up you still have
your throwing axe, he's still reachable another 30

356
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,299
feet for you right? Theoretically.

357
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,847
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm not using the axe or the
hammer, I'm using the sword.

358
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:12,536
MATT: You can still attach the Chain of
Returning to the Sword of Kas.

359
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:16,359
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's only one attack per
action.

360
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,461
MATT: Correct.

361
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,870
TRAVIS: Instead of three.

362
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,474
MARISHA: But it's something, if he's out of
range.

363
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:26,376
TALIESIN: I'll have enough bullets that I may not
be able to hurt him, but I can make him drop.

364
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,960
TRAVIS: What are you planning on doing?

365
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:36,159
SAM: My plan is to not run away, because we're
going to die fighting or we're going to save the

366
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,886
world, right? So I definitely won't be running
away. Definitely.

367
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,380
LAURA: Scanlan.

368
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,467
SAM: I may run away.

369
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:51,425
LIAM: If you do, and he slaughters everybody, and
subjugates the entire world--

370
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:55,076
SAM: I'll tell your story, and I'll tell it very
well.

371
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:59,877
LIAM: As the Crumbly, the little guy to Jabba the
Hutt, for Vecna.

372
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:05,741
LAURA: Scanlan. If you promise you won't run away,
I'll put this fucking hat back on.

373
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,381
SAM: (gasps)

374
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,621
LAURA: And I bring out the stupid pointy hat that
he gave me.

375
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,289
SAM: Wow! That's a deal.

376
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:16,859
TRAVIS: Here's the thing, last time we fought
Vecna, he went higher than 30 feet, he was up

377
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,182
where Vax was before he fell.

378
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:22,347
LIAM: I was above him though, and I was 50 or 60
up, he wasn't that high.

379
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,641
TRAVIS: Oh.

380
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:29,585
TALIESIN: Up to you, that is an option that is up
to you. But let me know, because either way I'm

381
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,761
going to either keep my boots or not keep my
boots.

382
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:39,319
MARISHA: Do we remember how high the tower orby
situation was, did we get a number for it?

383
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,047
MATT: The tower of Entropis? The very height of it
you didn't gauge entirely as you flew up, but even

384
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,013
at a bit of distance, it was hundreds of feet
high.

385
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:48,941
MARISHA: No, I mean, there was the dome above
that.

386
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:56,125
MATT: Oh, the dome above that is probably about
another 100 or 200 feet above that. It's a big

387
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,442
dome and it encompasses the entire city of
Entropis.

388
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:03,973
TALIESIN: And we don't know who's casting that, we
don't know where that's coming from.

389
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:05,648
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

390
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:06,898
TALIESIN: Okay.

391
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:10,556
MARISHA: I mean there's that gemstone thing that
he's using.

392
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:11,881
LAURA: Natural 20!

393
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,547
TALIESIN: No, but a 21 will do it.

394
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:19,587
MATT: You recall, the Thar Amphala that is
currently embedded in the titan is not the entire

395
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:24,604
city, it's only the inner circle of the city. You
encountered the inner circle of the city, and you

396
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:30,131
saw a little bit of the edges, there's a wall that
is built on the inside of Thar Amphala. This was

397
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:34,088
the same wall that contained the threshold crests
that caused it to transport from the Shadowfell to

398
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:41,378
the Prime Material Plane. You looked at the energy
of this field, you've seen it pulse from the wall

399
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:43,154
upward, like (pulse sounds).

400
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:47,565
TALIESIN: We could break through. We could break
the wall.

401
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:54,724
MARISHA: That's right! And then we could bring in
the forces.

402
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:59,122
LAURA: And then J'mon Sa Ord will be able to help
us. Help us!

403
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:01,981
MARISHA: Help us! Help us J'mon, help us!

404
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:12,300
LAURA: That's good, we go over the walls first.
Here's the good thing about us bamfing to the

405
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,414
Feywild, right. They think we left, and if we all
actually stick together and don't fuck up with

406
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:23,209
this fucking ring next time, they won't know that
we're there again. Because last time they had an

407
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:27,024
idea because you guys, you know, almost died as we
were going in.

408
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,673
MARISHA: Yeah I know, I remember.

409
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:34,015
SAM: I have an idea about Grog flying that just
occurred to me. Trinket's big.

410
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:35,940
LAURA: He is.

411
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,913
SAM: Trinket could be Polymorphed into something
else big, like a flying eagle of some sort. And

412
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,242
actually be useful.

413
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:49,603
LAURA: How dare you. If they Dispel that won't he
just turn into Trinket and he'll fall?

414
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:54,733
SAM: Yes, but with big risk comes big reward.

415
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,499
LAURA: Trinket?

416
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:03,783
MATT: Trinket over there is on the side, arms
playing pillow to the muzzle.

417
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:19,588
LAURA: Okay. Bud? If you fuck this up, Scanlan! Oh,
I don't have any more spells, do I, to do it? He

418
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:24,214
can understand me, I just can't understand him,
with my Speak With Animals. Shit.

419
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,122
ASHLEY: Tell him to just shake his head.

420
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:33,041
LAURA: Okay. Oh, it's 1st-level, I have a 1st-level
left. Okay, here's the thing, Scanlan wants to

421
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,512
turn you into something that flies.

422
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:39,323
MATT: You hear this slight squeak of a bear fart
in his direction.

423
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:51,008
LAURA: Good job. Yeah. Would you be willing to--
are you okay with that, for the actual big-- I

424
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:53,273
mean, you could be up close and personal with
fucking Vecna.

425
00:29:53,273 --> 00:30:00,044
MATT: Trinket walks up to you now, and his fully
grown form is a good foot and a half taller than

426
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:05,723
you at the shoulders. He comes up and gets really
close and (bear breathing), and butts his head

427
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:11,231
against you, and then licks the side of your
face.

428
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,217
LAURA: Yeah?

429
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:14,680
MATT: And sits back.

430
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:22,942
LAURA: Aw. You can do it. Don't hurt him! Okay.

431
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:24,467
SAM: It's a plan B.

432
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:28,443
LIAM: Do you have anything gnarlier than-- I mean,
I'm a little invested too, I've spent a lot of

433
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:32,789
years with this bear-- like, anything gnarlier
than-- an eagle's cool, but like anything with

434
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,414
spikes, or rhino armor, or anything like that?

435
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:36,837
TALIESIN: Like a flying rhino?

436
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,239
LIAM: Can you do a flying rhino?

437
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,253
SAM: What flying things have we seen that are
scary?

438
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:41,723
LAURA: A wyvern.

439
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:43,349
MARISHA: Polymorph, I don't know--

440
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:48,517
SAM: I can't Polymorph; I could <i>True</i> Polymorph
Trinket and permanently make him a wyvern.

441
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,475
MATT: It can still be dispelled if it is permanent
on True Polymorph, by the way.

442
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,857
SAM: It can be dispelled, just at an action?

443
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:59,943
MATT: Yeah. That was an errata to the spell that
I've discovered as the internet made very keenly

444
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,356
aware to me.

445
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:02,878
SAM: Even if it becomes permanent?

446
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:04,286
MATT: Correct.

447
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:05,147
SAM: Wow.

448
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,113
MARISHA: Then what the fuck does "permanent"
mean?

449
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:14,968
SAM: A simple, level three Dispel Magic can get
rid of a 9th-level permanent Polymorph?

450
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:18,706
MATT: Well, you have to know that the creature has
been polymorphed into that form. And even then,

451
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,924
it's a 9th-level spell that you're trying to
dispel, which is not--

452
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:24,206
MARISHA: So they have to at least cast it at
9th-level, in order to dispel it.

453
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:26,645
MATT: To be instantaneous. Or they have to roll
against it.

454
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:30,743
SAM: I'm not going to waste my True Polymorph on
that. Just standard Polymorph.

455
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:34,965
LIAM: Does that mean you could permanently do it
to him, and then <i>we</i> cast Dispel Magic on him

456
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,248
later to undo it?

457
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,509
MATT: Yeah. You could do that.

458
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:39,536
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, so you could use that tonight.

459
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:41,129
LIAM: Tonight. To lock him in.

460
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:43,894
SAM: Yeah. But it could still be dispelled.

461
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:51,280
TALIESIN: He would have to burn a dispel at
9th-level.

462
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,185
MARISHA: Wait, are you talking about Polymorph or
True Polymorph right now?

463
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:56,105
SAM: I was just talking about Polymorph.

464
00:31:56,105 --> 00:32:00,753
LAURA: I think Polymorph tomorrow and then use
your 9th-level spell for something major.

465
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,980
LIAM: But if it's permanent, why not do it
tonight?

466
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,674
LAURA: Because he can use a 9th-level spell
<i>tonight</i> for something.

467
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,726
MARISHA: Because Polymorph only lasts for, like,
an hour. What else you have?

468
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,148
LAURA: As we're doing this, we're making the
feast, because we're about to get ready to go to

469
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:12,250
bed, right?

470
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,175
MARISHA: Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom food.

471
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,340
LAURA: Yeah, so we make our feast before we go to
sleep.

472
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,261
MATT: All right. Polymorph is a concentration
spell, so keep that in mind.

473
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:21,253
SAM: Yes.

474
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:22,770
LIAM and TALIESIN: Oh.

475
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,942
MATT: Yes.

476
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,128
LAURA: Oh, shit.

477
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:26,382
SAM: Yeah.

478
00:32:26,382 --> 00:32:28,305
MATT: You wouldn't have to concentrate with True
Polymorph.

479
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:29,386
SAM: True.

480
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:32,440
MATT: But. Those are just the specifications.

481
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,254
SAM: What's more important?

482
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,893
LIAM: Could he be a baby, like a young ancient
dragon?

483
00:32:36,893 --> 00:32:39,025
SAM: Yeah.

484
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,458
LAURA: You can turn Trinket into a dragon?

485
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,371
SAM: Well, let's see here. He has a challenge
rating, doesn't he, this Trinket.

486
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:46,461
LAURA: Yeah.

487
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,442
MATT: I will put Trinket at about a challenge
rating of six, I'd say. Because he's not a full,

488
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:53,723
powerful creature; he's a complement to you.

489
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:54,727
LAURA: Right.

490
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:57,056
MATT: I'd put him at a six, maybe. High end.

491
00:32:57,056 --> 00:33:00,996
SAM: So monsters of a six. I don't even know; I'll
look at the list.

492
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:05,204
MATT: Okay. Think about it. Regardless. Who's
casting? You said you were casting Heroes' Feast?

493
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:13,677
All right, as you set up the table, you summon
forth the meal that is infused with divine energy.

494
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:21,066
You all begin to eat in solemn quiet, occasionally
discussing plans and tactics. The delicious--

495
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,674
LAURA: Artagan can join us.

496
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:26,401
MATT: Oh, he does. Don't worry. As soon as you
guys begin to eat, at the far end of the table you

497
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:30,495
see the orange mane erupt from the side of table
as he takes a seat. "Oh, wondrous. I appreciate

498
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:31,901
"this, thank you."

499
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,391
LIAM: So did that live up to your expectations,
then?

500
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:41,202
MATT: "Hello. It was all right."

501
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:44,510
LIAM: New hobby, or--?

502
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:52,831
MATT: "I don't know. Have to try when they're not
willing. That's a joke; that's a joke."

503
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:56,246
LAURA: Okay. Hey, Artagan, can you look at this
wand?

504
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,201
MATT: "Which wand?"

505
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,734
LAURA: This wand in my hand.

506
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:02,015
MATT: Which wand are you handing him?

507
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:05,603
LAURA: It was a wooden wand from one of Vecna's
people that I hijacked.

508
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:11,182
MATT: It's a war wand. It's a plus one wand. For
anyone who's casting a spell through it, it's a

509
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,358
plus one modifier to DC.

510
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,266
LAURA: Oh, do you have to attune?

511
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,508
MATT: Generally you have to attune to these,
yeah.

512
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:21,332
LAURA: Okay. Great. All right. Thanks.

513
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:25,245
TALIESIN: There's nothing special about these
symbols that they wear around their necks, are

514
00:34:25,245 --> 00:34:31,322
they? Just since it is in your interest to keep us
alive long enough to build you a portal.

515
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:35,644
MATT: "Well, it doesn't require or contain any
magic, if that's what you're asking."

516
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:36,584
TALIESIN: Yes.

517
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:37,917
TRAVIS: It's just jewelry.

518
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:43,150
MATT: "Well, it's a focus. It's a divine focus for
those who wish to utilize it to draw energy from

519
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:48,966
"their deity of choice, and/or just a token of
brotherhood."

520
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:50,870
TRAVIS: Boring.

521
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,046
MATT: "Delicious meal, by the way."

522
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:55,169
TRAVIS: Yeah.

523
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:56,284
MATT: "Is it yours?"

524
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:57,176
ASHLEY: Yes.

525
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,349
MATT: "Thank you."

526
00:34:58,349 --> 00:34:59,278
TRAVIS: So good.

527
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:00,605
ASHLEY: Oh, you're so welcome.

528
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:02,411
MATT: "All right. When do you intend to go back?"

529
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:04,509
LAURA: As soon as we go to sleep and wake up.

530
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:09,293
MATT: "Well then. Sleep it is." And he gestures
over, his hand behind you, and as you look back you can

531
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:14,977
see there's a series of beds that have all
constructed out of the nearby moss and vines. They

532
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:20,495
grow and lift up out of the natural floor of the
Feywild. As the beds form, you watch as the

533
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:26,766
tethered vines and roots to the ground begin to
form these dome-like tents over each specific bed.

534
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:28,478
LAURA: Oh, good. Privacy.

535
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:31,620
MARISHA: Are you doing anything?

536
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,938
SAM: Oh, yeah.

537
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:34,586
MARISHA: With your thing, before we go to sleep?

538
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:43,008
SAM: I mean, if I True Polymorph him, Trinket, I
could do a wyvern, or a young white dragon, or--

539
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,181
Is J'mon a brass or bronze?

540
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,529
TRAVIS and MATT: Brass.

541
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:53,432
SAM: I could do a young brass, young white dragon,
or a wyvern. Or I could have another Scanlan.

542
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:58,146
LAURA: Oh. I vote Scanlan.

543
00:35:58,146 --> 00:36:02,744
SAM: Scanlan Two can cast Polymorph.

544
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:10,078
LAURA: And he'll just hang around with us? Second
Scanlan hangs around with us until what?

545
00:36:10,078 --> 00:36:13,399
LIAM: I mean, that is flat-out amazing.

546
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,567
SAM: We'll see. (laughs) Or not.

547
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:17,590
TALIESIN: The world is ready for two Scanlans.

548
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,570
SAM: I'm pretty sure it will be apparent that he
is not a real person.

549
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,104
ASHLEY: How will he know which is which?

550
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:29,769
SAM: That's true. Well, you'll know, because, come
on. This charm can't be replicated.

551
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,414
LIAM: Nah, we need two hats or something.

552
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:36,846
MARISHA: Hang on, I will say, a second Scanlan
will immediately clue in Vecna that there's some

553
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:38,966
trickery magic going on.

554
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,091
SAM: Sure.

555
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:44,299
MARISHA: Is there a way that second Scanlan can
be, like, definitely hidden? So he can just be

556
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:47,590
(snaps) support Scanlan? Counterspell Scanlan?

557
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,426
TALIESIN: If we give him the Hat of
Disguise, then there's just a magical field being

558
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:53,712
about a magical--

559
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,648
LIAM: Can the Meat Man join us?

560
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:56,958
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

561
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,118
SAM: Yeah. He could be the Meat Man.

562
00:36:58,118 --> 00:36:59,346
TRAVIS: No truesight? No seeing through this?

563
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,722
LAURA: I'm sure they have truesight. Vecna's a
god. Of course he can see everything.

564
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:04,233
SAM: But I think you have to <i>use</i> truesight. It
doesn't just happen.

565
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:09,125
MATT: As a god of secrets, probably see through an
illusion.

566
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:13,682
TRAVIS: No, no, on. We're going to pull it over on
Vecna. We're fine. This is a great plan.

567
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:17,213
MATT: Just throwing it out there, based on your
experience, even the creatures <i>around</i> the tower

568
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,670
have truesight.

569
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,591
LAURA: Oh, shit. So he's going to know even, like,
he's going to know Trinket's not a fucking-- Is

570
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:28,588
that seen on truesight? Oh, no, he's <i>actually</i>
that animal. So he'd have to know.

571
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:33,403
TRAVIS: Do it, man. Do it. We're overthinking it.

572
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:37,824
MARISHA: Because he can also maybe just cast
support stuff for us, right?

573
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:39,595
LAURA: Yeah, exactly. Fuck it. Do it!

574
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,280
LIAM: Can Vecna just dispel the second Scanlan
away?

575
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,318
SAM: He can can certainly try.

576
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:46,779
TALIESIN: And he will have to burn some stuff.

577
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:52,062
MARISHA: And the only other thing would be, like,
a second Pike to do all of the Freedom of Movement

578
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,781
stuff, and things like that--

579
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:55,410
SAM: That's nice.

580
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,664
MARISHA: Those Counterspells, man--

581
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:02,247
MATT: Just keep in mind, Counterspell can't be
done unless they're on the field to see the spell

582
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:06,730
being cast and within 60 feet. So second Scanlan
would have to be in the fray.

583
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,830
MARISHA: Can second Scanlan be invisible second
Scanlan?

584
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,448
SAM: He can for a while, yeah.

585
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:14,888
MATT: You can. And things that see through
invisibility, like a god of secrets, would

586
00:38:14,888 --> 00:38:16,008
probably see through it.

587
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:18,505
LIAM: You can never have enough Scanlan. There's
always room for Scanlan.

588
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,399
SAM: These are good catch phrases, for sure.

589
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,839
TALIESIN: Depending on whether or not you have the
mount, let me know if you want to trade boots or

590
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,510
not, since these are non-attunable.

591
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:33,668
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, if someone has to roll to
see if second Scanlan is dispelled, do <i>you</i> have

592
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:34,799
to roll?

593
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,871
MATT: No.

594
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:37,314
MARISHA: Second Scanlan has to roll?

595
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:38,590
MATT: Vecna would have to roll.

596
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,786
MARISHA: Vecna has to roll.

597
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:40,913
TALIESIN: And Vecna will win.

598
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:42,455
LIAM: You know how Vecna rolls.

599
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,952
TRAVIS: And we're definitely doing the pillars?

600
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:47,707
MARISHA: I can throw up pillars.

601
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:49,335
TRAVIS: No, I mean, are we, or are we not?

602
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:50,121
MARISHA: Yeah.

603
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:53,222
LAURA: We are doing the pillars, if he's not doing
something on Trinket.

604
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:59,310
MARISHA: I think the pillars could be good for
cover and other things. Because I'm assuming we're--

605
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,771
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. We're doing the pillars.

606
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,505
LAURA: Scanlan, do something so that we can
sleep.

607
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:14,173
SAM: All right. I need the strength of two mes to
win this fight. So I'm going to drop to my knees,

608
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:24,650
and Wish to the gods that there was somehow more
of me, that I could somehow be in two places at

609
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:37,025
the same time. I wish for more me. Me-more. Me,
but more. Más Scanlan.

610
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:46,390
MATT: All right. As the words leave your lips, you
can see Artagan himself, as he finishes the meal,

611
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:54,075
leans back. "Hmm." Like, seemingly taken aback by
the power of these words you've spoken, as you

612
00:39:54,075 --> 00:40:02,482
watch as hints of nearby slowly melting snowfall
that seem to have gathered elements at the base of

613
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:08,806
the trees nearby begin to slowly congeal into a
form. You do realize that this is going to take

614
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,020
you 12 hours to complete, right?

615
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,224
SAM: Oh, yeah.

616
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:13,410
LAURA: So you should've started that earlier.

617
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,481
SAM: Shit. (laughs)

618
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:15,525
MATT: Yeah.

619
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:17,092
MARISHA: So can we decide that earlier?

620
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,326
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

621
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:19,413
MARISHA: That's cool.

622
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,717
SAM: You guys can sleep, then I'll sleep, you wait
for me.

623
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:26,586
MATT: You'll be arriving a little later than
originally anticipated. Who knows what

624
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:28,179
ramifications that'll have.

625
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:30,306
TRAVIS: Just do it, man.

626
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:32,796
SAM: Sorry. It's already being done.

627
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:35,138
MATT: All right, so.

628
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:39,499
SAM: Shit! We should have done that when we were
waiting for fucking Vax!

629
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:40,468
LAURA: I know!

630
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:42,112
MARISHA: I thought that's what we were doing!

631
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:43,645
SAM: I didn't know it takes that long!

632
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:46,294
MARISHA: We tried. Wait, we definitely mentioned
that!

633
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,538
MATT: Simulacrum is a 12-hour casting time.

634
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:50,331
SAM: (whispers) Okay.

635
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:51,349
TRAVIS: It's okay.

636
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,719
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's done.

637
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,652
LAURA: What's done is done.

638
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:59,988
MATT: Over the next 12 hours, you sit there
focusing on trying to press your will into this

639
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:10,436
congealing snow golem of Scanlan, and watch as it
slowly takes form and breathes air, and-- with no

640
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:15,390
equipment, of course-- but has your knowledge,
your spells. Eventually, the completion of the

641
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,973
spell brings to life a secondary Scanlan, under
your beck and call.

642
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:26,233
SAM: Oh my god. Hello, Scanlan, is it you?

643
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,568
MATT: "It's me."

644
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,337
SAM and MATT: (gasps) Oh!

645
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:33,527
SAM: You're shorter than I thought you'd be.

646
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,264
MATT: "Speak for yourself."

647
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:39,170
SAM: All right, let's just see if you're really
Scanlan.

648
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,116
MATT: He's already naked.

649
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:50,741
SAM: Oh, okay. Let's see. I whip out my little
measuring tape. One inch, by one inch, by one

650
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:55,533
inch. Mm-hmm. That part's the same.

651
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,518
MATT: "Mm-hmm. How do we know I'm not the real
Scanlan?"

652
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,435
LAURA: How <i>do</i> we know you're not the real
Scanlan?

653
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,883
SAM: I think there's only one way to find out.

654
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:05,409
LIAM: Sing off.

655
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:06,816
SAM: (singing) Naa!

656
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:17,710
MATT and SAM: (singing in unison) "Naa! Molto
bene, molto bene--"

657
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,990
TALIESIN: Well, that's everything I needed.

658
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,148
MATT: You're halfway through your sleep.

659
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:28,877
LAURA: Shut up, Scanlans!

660
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:32,040
TRAVIS: Isn't Wish instantaneous?

661
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,564
MATT: The spell is instantaneous, unless it's
copying the effect of a spell.

662
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:40,503
SAM: All right. This worked. Scanlan, let's go to
sleep.

663
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:42,411
MATT: "All right, Scanlan. Where to?"

664
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:44,048
SAM: I'll spoon you.

665
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:51,429
MATT: "Okay." All right, you guys head off to your
domicile.

666
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,165
LIAM: This is the last check off your list, I
think.

667
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:56,311
TALIESIN: Some items for other Scanlan.

668
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:57,947
SAM: Oh, we have extra items?

669
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:58,973
TALIESIN: Yeah.

670
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:02,474
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Other Scanlan can wear things?
He's fully--

671
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:04,382
MATT: He can wear things.

672
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:07,787
TRAVIS: You want bracers of defense? Plus two to
your AC?

673
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:09,175
LAURA: Oh, yeah, put on that armor that I gave
you.

674
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:10,438
SAM: Because he doesn't have any of my items, does
he?

675
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:11,856
MATT: Nope. He is naked.

676
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:15,387
LAURA: Put him in the armor I gave you that you
don't wear.

677
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,442
SAM: Yes, yes, I will put him in the armor of--

678
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:18,882
LAURA: Acid resistance.

679
00:43:18,882 --> 00:43:20,883
SAM: Acid-- No, I have acid, you had cold.

680
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:23,146
LAURA: No, I have cold now. It was--

681
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:24,362
SAM: Oh, we had two acids!

682
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:25,626
LAURA: Yeah, that's what it was.

683
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:26,945
SAM: Yeah. So it's acid resistance.

684
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:28,085
MATT: Okay. There you go.

685
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:29,365
ASHLEY: I have a shield of fire resistance.

686
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:31,894
LAURA: What about the wand of plus one, for the
spells?

687
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:34,104
SAM: Wand of plus one, what is that?

688
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:36,028
LAURA: It's a war wand.

689
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,125
SAM: Yeah, great. Do that.

690
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,054
TALIESIN: And then, here.

691
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:45,491
SAM: He's also got bracers of defense, gloves of
missile snaring, and a dragon slayer longsword?

692
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:46,530
Sure, why not.

693
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,713
MATT: All right, so you got those. So you go ahead
and find yourself to sleep. The rest of you, the

694
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:55,762
night's rest, if there's any final words before
the fray comes, anything you want to do to calm

695
00:43:55,762 --> 00:43:58,116
yourself before the final battle, now's the time.

696
00:43:58,116 --> 00:44:00,497
LAURA: Oh god.

697
00:44:00,497 --> 00:44:02,450
ASHLEY: Fuck.

698
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,619
LAURA: This could be it, huh?

699
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:04,915
MARISHA: This is real fucked up.

700
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:08,497
TRAVIS: I'm real excited, actually. Like, you
know, you always want to test yourself to see what

701
00:44:08,497 --> 00:44:12,862
you're made of, what is your mettle really like.
We're going to find out. We're really going to

702
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:15,724
find out. Nobody else excited?

703
00:44:15,724 --> 00:44:18,452
TALIESIN: I don't know if <i>excited</i> is the word.

704
00:44:18,452 --> 00:44:26,427
MARISHA: There's been a few times that we've all
known we could die together, but this might

705
00:44:26,427 --> 00:44:28,446
actually be it.

706
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:31,481
LAURA: Oh. That's true.

707
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:32,828
MARISHA: Yeah.

708
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:36,551
LAURA: You know what? We're doing it for a good
cause, though. Saving the world.

709
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,082
MARISHA: It's fine. Yeah?

710
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:41,968
TRAVIS: Yeah. Together, right?

711
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:44,308
SAM and ASHLEY: Together.

712
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,323
TALIESIN and LAURA: No regrets.

713
00:44:47,323 --> 00:44:50,228
LIAM: These last three or four years have been the
best of my life.

714
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:54,864
MARISHA: Same.

715
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:56,519
TRAVIS: Yeah.

716
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,697
LAURA: I had a good run a few years before that,
but this is pretty great.

717
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,100
TALIESIN: I'm going to remember that you said
that.

718
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,052
SAM: Last year I was a crime boss, but the last
few days have been really fun.

719
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:16,685
TALIESIN: Everything since I met you all has felt
like a dream. Even the worst of it.

720
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:20,139
TRAVIS: I love all of you. (snores)

721
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:24,562
MARISHA: Aw, that's so cute; he's honest when he's
asleep.

722
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:27,124
TALIESIN: Would it be wrong to shave his beard,
just one more time?

723
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,969
TRAVIS: (snorts awake before returning to
snoring)

724
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,611
LIAM: We need his head in the game.

725
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:34,964
LAURA: Yeah. It gives him strength.

726
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:38,029
MARISHA: I think it's like his focus, you know?

727
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:39,483
TRAVIS: Boobies.

728
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:41,411
TALIESIN: One of them, yes.

729
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:49,762
ASHLEY: I feel like I don't want to go to sleep.

730
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:53,230
LAURA: (whispers) I know. We need to, though.

731
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,232
MARISHA: Like, it's weird to say goodnight,
right?

732
00:45:56,232 --> 00:46:01,868
LAURA: We can totally take this guy. Fuck it.
We're not going down.

733
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:05,165
SAM: Yeah.

734
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,358
LAURA: Yeah.

735
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:08,504
SAM: Yeah. He doesn't know what's going to hit
him.

736
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:09,586
LAURA: Exactly.

737
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:10,997
SAM: We're the S.H.I.T.s.

738
00:46:10,997 --> 00:46:12,355
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah!

739
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:13,530
LAURA: Fuck him.

740
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,862
ASHLEY: Yeah.

741
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:19,172
LAURA: We've got other gods on our side. He's a
fucking half-ass god.

742
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:21,154
ASHLEY: That's true.

743
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:44,773
LAURA: That's right. And you-- You're not going
anywhere.

744
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:47,722
MARISHA: All right. Good night?

745
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,929
LAURA: Good night.

746
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:51,445
TALIESIN: In the morning.

747
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:57,041
LIAM: Yeah, Percy, get your rest, because your
last words to me tomorrow need to be indignant and

748
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,829
irritated.

749
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:01,732
TALIESIN: I've already planned them out.

750
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,127
LIAM: Goodnight, brother.

751
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:04,796
TALIESIN: Goodnight, brother.

752
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:06,489
TRAVIS: And we sleep.

753
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:13,663
MATT: All right. You all find yourselves resting,
uncomfortable at first, but the knowledge and the

754
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:20,929
exhaustion hitting you, eventually it takes you.
The dreams lead seamlessly, one to the next.

755
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:28,955
Memories of your meeting, of your story, of your
experiences, bleeding between your fears, your

756
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:36,025
victories, and the people whose lives you've
touched and who've touched your lives. Of Wilhand.

757
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:51,379
The fall of Kevdak. To the respect of your father,
and the vengeance of your mother. To climbing the

758
00:47:51,379 --> 00:48:01,538
destiny of the Aramente. To rebuilding the memory
of one's family.

759
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,544
And to spooning a second version of yourself.

760
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:15,391
(laughing)

761
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:21,212
LIAM: (singing) Oh, my darling, I hunger for your
touch--

762
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:34,941
MATT: And knowing that you've taken your faith
from a place of being forgotten to a newly built

763
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:48,128
symbol of hope. These thoughts all mingle, as the
dark of rest takes you. And as you all awake, in

764
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:54,033
the center of this strange, mystical meadow,
peeking through the hints of purple and orange

765
00:48:54,033 --> 00:49:02,646
that signify the sky that breaks through the
canopy of this forest, the pools of Nala that once

766
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:09,946
brought you here long ago. You all awake, the beds
gone, the tents gone. You're all lying amongst

767
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:17,864
this field in a circle, around each other. As you
come to consciousness, you all sit up, take a

768
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:28,090
breath, feel the warmth and the knowledge of what
has to be done wash over you, the shadow between

769
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:36,897
two distant trees reveals the orange mane of
Artagan once more, as he steps forth, his high

770
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:42,547
green collar disappearing into his long sleeves,
and a cloak that billows past his shoulders and

771
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:51,218
loops into his back, as he almost glides
effortlessly through the grass. "I take it you all

772
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,788
"slept well?"

773
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,141
TRAVIS: Yeah.

774
00:49:55,141 --> 00:50:03,728
MATT: "Well, then. Time is of the essence. You've
been here more than a day."

775
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:07,126
LAURA: Just barely.

776
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:16,078
MATT: "Just know. But whenever you're ready. I'll
see what I can whip up." As he wipes his fingers

777
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:21,187
against each other, you can see the sparkle,
spiral of purples and blues and oranges and

778
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:26,274
colors, causing this glow under his face and his
hair as he gets excited at the prospect of seeing

779
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:31,082
just how far he can tweak the boundaries of the
Feywild that he calls home.

780
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:35,790
MARISHA: All right.

781
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:43,145
TALIESIN: Here we go.

782
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:47,308
TRAVIS: What are you holding over there?

783
00:50:47,308 --> 00:50:51,434
SAM: Myself. My other hand.

784
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,553
LAURA: Trinket's back in the necklace for the
bamfing over.

785
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:55,074
MATT: Okay.

786
00:50:55,074 --> 00:51:04,546
MARISHA: To Thar Amphala. On the back of a titan.
On the Material Plane.

787
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:10,979
MATT: "Take them." As you concentrate, and the
spell begins to swell around you, this familiar

788
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:16,965
energy begins to ride up in your stomach. You feel
the butterflies take form. And as the realm begins

789
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:23,026
to darken, the colors that you see, spiraling out
of Artagan's hands, begin to consume you as well.

790
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:28,789
And nausea takes over and you feel yourself
wretched left and right, as darkness begins to

791
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:32,897
swell once more and close in, the colors surround
you entirely. And you feel like you're being

792
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:37,397
pushed through a window. As you all land and catch
your feet, the darkness subsides, the color

793
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:41,003
subsides, and you all feel immediately queasy,
falling to your knees.

794
00:51:41,003 --> 00:51:47,523
As you glance around you, you can see you stand in
the rubble, the exterior of a building that has

795
00:51:47,523 --> 00:51:53,966
fallen long ago. You see large chunks of the
secondary floor fallen inward and dust (poof)

796
00:51:53,966 --> 00:51:59,447
around you as your knees hit. You look up and can
see the familiar green-blue crackle of the barrier

797
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:04,989
above you. You've managed to make it on the
interior of Thar Amphala. You look up to see,

798
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:10,395
immediately, clusters of gloomstalkers in the
distance. They haven't quite gotten a view on you.

799
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,897
LAURA: In the building, now!

800
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:14,856
MATT: You guys all dart. Make a stealth check,
please.

801
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:18,617
TRAVIS: First roll, first roll, first roll.

802
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:19,890
LIAM: Natural 20.

803
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,462
ALL: Hey!

804
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:22,821
MARISHA: Good luck!

805
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,658
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

806
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,472
MATT: That's one way to do it.

807
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:28,021
MARISHA: Oh, natural 19.

808
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:29,268
ALL: Ooh.

809
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:31,268
SAM: Scanlan One, 19. Scanlan Two, 21.

810
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:32,738
TALIESIN: 19.

811
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:34,686
MARISHA: 28.

812
00:52:34,686 --> 00:52:36,014
LAURA: 35.

813
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,339
ASHLEY: 18.

814
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:38,859
TRAVIS: 11.

815
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:44,853
MATT: Okay. This building is mostly collapsed;
there's a small alcove in the corner where part of

816
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:48,266
the secondary story is still there. You guys dart
into the side of it and you rest there for a

817
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:54,938
minute in quiet. (nervous breathing) And you
suddenly hear an impact of stone against the wall

818
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:59,709
behind you. All of you guys immediately turn
around and you watch as the heavy piece of stone

819
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:05,458
that marks the outer part of this building is now
cracked, and part of it begins to fall in. I need

820
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:09,182
Scanlan One, real Scanlan, and Percy to make
dexterity saving throws, please.

821
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:13,819
SAM: Not good. Ten.

822
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:18,487
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a resolve.

823
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,988
TRAVIS: Burning it already?

824
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,270
SAM: What?

825
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,890
TALIESIN: I rolled really low. I want to do that a
little better.

826
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,196
LIAM: So take a conk on the head!

827
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:25,236
TALIESIN: Oh, fine.

828
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:26,388
LAURA: No, you don't know! You don't know!

829
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:27,534
TALIESIN: I don't know-- which is why I am.

830
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:29,126
MATT: What are you going to do? Are you going take
it or not?

831
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,862
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to kill a resolve, one
more. That's way better! Natural 20.

832
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:34,278
MATT: Okay, cool. You only take three points of
bludgeoning damage.

833
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:35,280
TALIESIN: That'll do.

834
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,310
MATT: Scanlan takes six.

835
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,575
TALIESIN: It's just a resolve; I got three.

836
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:39,001
TRAVIS: Six points.

837
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:40,483
MATT: You reduced three points of damage.

838
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,498
LAURA: I thought they could be trapped under the
wall or something.

839
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:46,259
TALIESIN: No, it was fair. I'm not in the mood for
that. And resolves I got plenty of.

840
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:51,535
MATT: It crumples over onto you. You manage to
pull away. As you turn around, you can see, right

841
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:58,676
around the edge of the part of the building that's
collapsed and fallen, a gloomstalker, covered in

842
00:53:58,676 --> 00:54:03,266
dust, shaking its head as it attempts to stand
once more. It looks like it's been slammed to

843
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:08,758
the ground, or crashed into this wall. And you can
see it's on the ground, (croaking noises), shaking

844
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:11,740
its head and trying to get back up, its wings
trying to unfurl.

845
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:18,629
As it rights its head, you see a leaping blur of
black armor and red scales climb to the back of

846
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:23,823
the beast, grasping the side of its shoulders as
it spins back and forth, trying to shake it. You

847
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:29,390
see this humanoid figure, trying to take something
and throw it around its throat and its head,

848
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:34,671
however, it's just not able to grasp it around,
and gets thrown off the side and to the back. You

849
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:39,195
watch as the gloomstalker bucks off the assailant
and begins to try and get its wings up once more,

850
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:43,565
as the figure leaps up again and shoulder slams it
into the wall a second time. You get a better look

851
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:51,068
at it now. You can see now, standing at a pretty
decent height, about a seven-foot dragonborn of

852
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:58,471
red scale and black, hooked armor, bladed and
angry. You see a burning fury in its eyes. Joe, if

853
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:59,960
you want to come to the table, please.

854
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,444
ALL: Ooh!

855
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:09,999
(cheering)

856
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:13,576
LIAM: Welcome to the table!

857
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,925
SAM: What's this?

858
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:22,311
(cheering and laughing)

859
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:23,658
JOE: Yes!

860
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:25,263
TRAVIS: Brothers in arms! Yeah!

861
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:27,120
TALIESIN: I like that it's kitty-corner right
now.

862
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,808
JOE: The tanks on the ends.

863
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:39,061
MATT: Arkhan. You've been trying to wrestle this
gloomstalker down-- You spent days here, trying to

864
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:43,492
find a way to recover from the circumstances that
left you here. This is the closest thing you've

865
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:46,429
had at this circumstance, as you've regained your
strength, and as you leap onto its back, it

866
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:50,379
continues to knock you off to the side. You guys
see this confrontation happening. What do you do?

867
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:53,755
LAURA: Does it look like-- (pained noise)

868
00:55:53,755 --> 00:55:55,141
TRAVIS: No, I'll run in.

869
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,526
LIAM: Yeah, he's attacking a gloomstalker; I'll
join in.

870
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:59,180
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

871
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,011
LIAM: I'm going to help this guy out and throw.

872
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:04,127
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make two
attacks.

873
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,432
LIAM: All right. Plus one to--

874
00:56:06,432 --> 00:56:09,033
JOE: Wait, don't hurt him! Don't hurt him; I
scream: Don't hurt him.

875
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,651
MATT: Well, he's thrown two daggers.

876
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:12,725
LIAM: I did, and they both hit.

877
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:15,666
MATT: Yes. Technically adjacent, so you do sneak
attack damage.

878
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:16,795
LIAM: All right, I will.

879
00:56:16,795 --> 00:56:19,050
SAM: Oh boy.

880
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:25,377
LIAM: Four-- It could be bad. 12--

881
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:29,915
TALIESIN: Oh, wow. What are you doing?

882
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:31,805
LAURA: All of the damage.

883
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,986
TRAVIS: Save it for battle!

884
00:56:34,986 --> 00:56:37,023
LIAM: 34, 35-- I can't! It's too late; it's
triggered!

885
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:38,554
LAURA: No! Don't do it!

886
00:56:38,554 --> 00:56:40,872
LIAM: 46 for the first.

887
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:43,219
SAM: I cover tiny Scanlan's eyes.

888
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:46,312
LAURA: Welcome to the game, Joe!

889
00:56:46,312 --> 00:56:49,142
TRAVIS: This is what we do.

890
00:56:49,142 --> 00:56:50,979
MARISHA: Yeah, what were you <i>trying</i> to do?

891
00:56:50,979 --> 00:56:52,653
JOE: I hope you have a healing potion.

892
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:53,988
SAM: Nope.

893
00:56:53,988 --> 00:57:01,565
MATT: That's 51 points of damage. You have 46 and
four? It's 50 points of damage. Marking that down.

894
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:06,186
You see two daggers into the side of the
gloomstalker. It gives this horrible shrieking

895
00:57:06,186 --> 00:57:09,311
shout in pain and rears up.

896
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:13,789
JOE: Now that it's distracted, does that give me
some sort of advantage?

897
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:21,283
MATT: I will say, given the pain it's had, make an
athletics check because you are attempting to grapple

898
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:22,725
the entity.

899
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,913
JOE: That's correct. All right, okay.

900
00:57:24,913 --> 00:57:28,997
LAURA: Can we see, does it look like he's got
hands and eyes complete?

901
00:57:28,997 --> 00:57:32,167
JOE: That's athletics, that's going to be a 19.

902
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:34,685
MATT: Natural 20.

903
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:39,171
JOE: Is it part dragon?

904
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:42,174
MATT: No. It is not. It's considered a
monstrosity.

905
00:57:42,174 --> 00:57:44,686
JOE: Okay, fair enough. Okay.

906
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:51,829
MATT: That's okay. You hear the dragonborn shout
out, seeing the dagger slam into its side. What do

907
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,694
you yell to them as they're attacking it?

908
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:56,499
JOE: Don't hurt this thing. Help me wrestle it to
the ground.

909
00:57:56,499 --> 00:58:01,385
MATT: At which point, it now thrusts the
dragonborn off of its back. He goes tumbling and

910
00:58:01,385 --> 00:58:04,008
rolling onto the ground, landing onto your back,
and you see it--

911
00:58:04,008 --> 00:58:06,584
LAURA: I throw out the Rope of Entanglement. On
the gloomstalker.

912
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:09,798
MARISHA: I turn to Percy, and I go: Who's fighting
who?!

913
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:11,320
TALIESIN: I don't know!

914
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,105
MATT: So now I would like an initiative roll from
everybody, please.

915
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:16,870
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh shit.

916
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,940
TRAVIS: What's that? Plus a d10 to my initiative
now?

917
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,296
SAM: Does Scanlan Two take my initiative, or no?

918
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:26,675
MATT: Separately.

919
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:29,983
LAURA: You're two people again! How does it feel?

920
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:31,608
SAM: The best.

921
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,501
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

922
00:58:33,501 --> 00:58:34,485
LAURA: 24.

923
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:36,584
SAM: Natural 20, which made a 23.

924
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:37,864
TRAVIS: 22.

925
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:43,379
MATT: All right. Grog-- All right. Super low. All
right, 20 to 15?

926
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:47,067
JOE and MARISHA: 17.

927
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,475
SAM: Oh, sorry, Scanlan Two is also 21.

928
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:54,022
LIAM: Joe, you're sitting on Scanlan Two.

929
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:57,599
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

930
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,400
TALIESIN: 12. No, really?

931
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,708
ASHLEY: Well, would I be Pike without rolling shit
initiative?

932
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:09,704
MATT: Vax, what'd you get?

933
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:10,746
LIAM: Eight.

934
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,578
MATT: Eight, wow. What'd you get, Pike?

935
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:14,010
ASHLEY: Yes. A six.

936
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:20,319
MATT: All right, so. Vex, you're up first. You're
going to use the--

937
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,656
LAURA: The Rope of Entanglement, is what I was
going for. I can't find my--

938
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:30,335
MATT: I have the sheet here. So you thrust it out.
It has to make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw.

939
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:31,464
LAURA: Yeah.

940
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:38,951
MATT: All right. Let's see here-- Natural one.
Natural 20 to natural one. Back to back. As you

941
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:41,956
fall onto your back and shout that out, you go
rushing towards it and you watch as this glowing,

942
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:46,719
long piece of thick rope begins to suddenly wrap
around this gloomstalker as it's trying to take

943
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,111
off again. It gets, like, a foot off the ground
before its wings get pulled up to its body, and it

944
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:54,942
falls back onto the ground, wrapped and restrained
by the rope.

945
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:58,246
JOE: Great. I can do my thing now?

946
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:00,894
MATT: Is anybody else going to do anything, right
now?

947
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:04,300
TRAVIS: Yeah, I run up. I'm going to run up, and
grab it by the head and neck and lay on it.

948
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,893
MATT: Okay. Scanlans?

949
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:10,506
SAM: I'm just watching. And I turn to Scanlan Two
and say: So that's a gloomstalker.

950
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:11,633
TALIESIN: "Yes."

951
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:15,296
SAM: And that guy, I'm not sure what he is, but he
looks really cool.

952
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:17,407
TALIESIN: "<i>I</i> know what he is. I'm not going to
tell you, though."

953
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:21,020
MATT: All right, Arkhan.

954
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:29,960
JOE: I remove this golden-needled, five-jeweled
wreath from around my neck, and I approach the

955
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,365
beast, and I fasten it around its neck.

956
01:00:33,365 --> 01:00:37,830
SAM and TRAVIS: Shock collar.

957
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,029
MATT: Kind of. So it's a DC 17.

958
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:42,130
TRAVIS: If it barks, it activates.

959
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:49,436
MATT: Five plus six, that's an eleven. It does not
succeed. You watch as the thrashing around

960
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:55,838
gloomstalker on the ground begins to slowly calm
down until it reaches a point where it's not

961
01:00:55,838 --> 01:01:03,625
moving; it's breathing, and you almost hear what
sounds like a reverse purr.

962
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:07,404
JOE: Does this thing have horns?

963
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:14,205
MATT: It has a series of spines along the back of
the neck, but no actual horns. It has a head that

964
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:19,554
flares out like a cobra, but it's made of shadow.
Where the jaw is, its tongue lashes out, but

965
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:22,433
instead of saliva, it gives off smoke.

966
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:28,813
JOE: Then I grab it by the back of the jaw, here,
and I put my forehead down to its forehead, and I

967
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:34,414
close my eyes, and then open them, and they turn
into that thing's eyes, correct?

968
01:01:34,414 --> 01:01:35,615
MATT: Mm-hmm.

969
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,083
JOE: Yeah.

970
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:42,567
MATT: So the gloomstalkers, they have no
discernible pupil; it's a glowing beacon of

971
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:49,095
yellow-white where each eye is. And you watch as
this dragonborn opens its eyes, it's headbutted

972
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:53,765
against it, and the dragonborn's eyes now match
the coloration of the gloomstalker.

973
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:56,024
JOE: I climb up onto its back.

974
01:01:56,024 --> 01:02:00,988
MATT: Okay. It's still bound by the rope. But you
get up onto it now. You watch as this massive

975
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:06,477
dragonborn gets up onto the gloomstalker, which is
now currently on the ground, trying to right

976
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,158
itself now, still wrapped in the rope.

977
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,299
JOE: You can release the rope now.

978
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:11,860
LAURA: Does it look like anybody's noticed us?

979
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,256
MATT: Make a perception check.

980
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:18,510
SAM: We've been fighting silently.

981
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:24,158
LAURA: 33.

982
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:30,722
MATT: You do look and see two more gloomstalkers
that have broken away from the cluster, that are

983
01:02:30,722 --> 01:02:32,537
making their way in your direction.

984
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:37,092
LAURA: Will this thing obey you? We should get
inside. I let go of the rope and go back in the

985
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:39,092
building so that we can hide.

986
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:40,398
MATT: Okay. Everyone else following?

987
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:41,883
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

988
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,523
MATT: Everyone else following suit?

989
01:02:43,523 --> 01:02:44,567
SAM: Yes.

990
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:45,673
MATT: Okay. You?

991
01:02:45,673 --> 01:02:46,875
JOE: Yeah. Absolutely.

992
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,557
MATT: All right. Do you leave the gloomstalker
where it is and then step inside with them?

993
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,908
JOE: Can I take it with me?

994
01:02:50,908 --> 01:02:52,020
MATT: If you want to.

995
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,385
JOE: I'd like to take it with me.

996
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:57,747
MATT: As you guys all dart inside this alcove in
the building-- Like, most of the roof is gone;

997
01:02:57,747 --> 01:03:02,713
there's a section of roof that's there. It can
hide most of you. The gloomstalker's a bit large,

998
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:07,514
as you all cluster into the space, as it looms in.
(heavy footsteps) This is the second time you've

999
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:12,858
had an allied gloomstalker this close, and it's a
very upsetting proximity.

1000
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:16,480
MARISHA: Uncomfortable elevator at a convention.

1001
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,292
MATT: Kind of. As you guys pull into the side, I'd
like you all to make a stealth check, please.

1002
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,176
MARISHA: Why did you wear wings?

1003
01:03:22,176 --> 01:03:23,367
LAURA: Stealth check!

1004
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:29,668
JOE: If I'm on its back, does that have anything
to do with my plate armor? Meaning, am I relying

1005
01:03:29,668 --> 01:03:34,387
on some form of stalking that doesn't make my
armor clank around?

1006
01:03:34,387 --> 01:03:39,631
MATT: Unfortunately, as you're still riding it and
it moves and shifts, there is still the plate

1007
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:41,691
sitting against it, so you would still be at a
disadvantage.

1008
01:03:41,691 --> 01:03:42,991
JOE: Am I the only one in plate armor here?

1009
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:44,517
LAURA: No, she's got plate armor.

1010
01:03:44,517 --> 01:03:45,728
ASHLEY: Nope. Clanky twins!

1011
01:03:45,728 --> 01:03:47,516
JOE: I just didn't want to be fully responsible.

1012
01:03:47,516 --> 01:03:49,540
TRAVIS: She has something that makes her less
clanky-like.

1013
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,207
LAURA: Yeah, you got your boots.

1014
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:52,453
ASHLEY: Boots!?

1015
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,146
LAURA: Yeah, so you don't roll at disadvantage
anymore.

1016
01:03:54,146 --> 01:03:55,350
ASHLEY: Wait, wait.

1017
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,901
LAURA: Yeah. You got non-clanky boots.

1018
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:59,604
JOE: And I am at disadvantage? (sighs)

1019
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:04,649
LAURA: Add ten to your roll.

1020
01:04:04,649 --> 01:04:06,402
SAM: Yeah, you're fine.

1021
01:04:06,402 --> 01:04:07,616
JOE: Okay. 20.

1022
01:04:07,616 --> 01:04:08,786
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah!

1023
01:04:08,786 --> 01:04:09,889
JOE: Disadvantage.

1024
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,665
MATT: By the way, there's your stat sheet for the
gloomstalker.

1025
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:13,012
JOE: Yes!

1026
01:04:13,012 --> 01:04:15,021
MATT: It's taken 50 damage, so you can note that.

1027
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:16,727
JOE: Can I feed it a healing potion?

1028
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,743
MATT: When you have a moment you can, yeah.

1029
01:04:18,743 --> 01:04:24,782
JOE: Yeah. Trust me. It's all going to work out.
What could go wrong?

1030
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:29,482
LIAM: You were jumping at him, and punching him in
the face. I thought wrong. I do that sometimes.

1031
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:31,220
ASHLEY: Do you have a name for him?

1032
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,622
SAM: Do <i>you</i> have a name?

1033
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:35,452
ASHLEY: Do you have a name? That's true. I just
love animals.

1034
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:39,624
SAM: We can kill you any second, so be scared of
us, if you're an evil person.

1035
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:42,912
JOE: You could. But I know these two.

1036
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,356
SAM: What?

1037
01:04:44,356 --> 01:04:47,818
MATT: And there's a moment of recognition for
Percival and Keyleth.

1038
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:50,072
MARISHA: Oh, holy shit.

1039
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:51,416
TRAVIS: No way.

1040
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,652
MARISHA: Oh. It's been, like-- two years?

1041
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:56,097
TALIESIN: At least two years.

1042
01:04:56,097 --> 01:05:01,020
JOE: At least. Percival, you've aged. Keyleth, you
still look the same.

1043
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,918
MARISHA: (giggles)

1044
01:05:02,918 --> 01:05:04,250
TALIESIN: She got a haircut.

1045
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,908
LAURA: Oh, shit. Are you going to let him do that
to your girl?

1046
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:10,599
MATT: It's at this moment you hear two heavy
impacts from nearby rooftops.

1047
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:15,803
TRAVIS: Okay. Maybe not the best reunion time.

1048
01:05:15,803 --> 01:05:22,260
MATT: As you all stay as silent as possible,
waiting, one of them takes off. And you can see it

1049
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:28,617
arc barely over the opening, but seems to be doing
a wide sweep, out of visual range. The other one

1050
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:37,991
appears to be stalking from rooftop to rooftop,
not far from you. (thudding) (sniffing and

1051
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:52,815
croaking) It leaps and lands on top of the small
part of the roof that's above you guys. It holds.

1052
01:05:52,815 --> 01:06:07,348
A few rocks tumble around you as you're quietly in
that space, hoping. (thudding and croaking) Its

1053
01:06:07,348 --> 01:06:10,922
head peeks over the edge and looks straight down,
right into all of you.

1054
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:12,958
LAURA: Oh, God darn it.

1055
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,628
MATT: What are you doing?

1056
01:06:14,628 --> 01:06:17,556
LAURA: I shoot an arrow into its eyeball.

1057
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:22,960
MATT: Okay. So as soon as the head passes over,
make your attacks. You're close enough to get one

1058
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,498
swipe up, because you're on the back of a
gloomstalker. So as its head peeks down, you can

1059
01:06:26,498 --> 01:06:28,173
get a strike at it.

1060
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:29,335
TRAVIS: How high up?

1061
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:32,153
MATT: It's about, I'd say, 12 to 15 feet up.

1062
01:06:32,153 --> 01:06:33,533
LAURA: 35.

1063
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:34,910
MATT: That hits.

1064
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:38,973
JOE: That's going to be a 31.

1065
01:06:38,973 --> 01:06:40,600
MATT: That hits.

1066
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:48,484
JOE: Damn, that's a Vox Machina number. About damn
time. That's what level 17 will get you. All

1067
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:49,984
right. Yeah.

1068
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:51,597
MATT: All righty. So.

1069
01:06:51,597 --> 01:06:53,057
LIAM: 20, 21, and a miss.

1070
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:54,725
MATT: Okay. So those both hit.

1071
01:06:54,725 --> 01:06:55,801
LAURA: 25 damage.

1072
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:57,188
MATT: 25 damage, all righty.

1073
01:06:57,188 --> 01:07:00,000
LAURA: Oh, and I get to do it again?

1074
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,145
MATT: You do.

1075
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:04,417
LIAM: Is his proximity close enough that either of
these guys are within five feet, or anybody's

1076
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:05,278
within--?

1077
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:08,667
MATT: No. Oh, I'd say Arkhan probably is.

1078
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,483
LAURA: 18?

1079
01:07:10,483 --> 01:07:12,776
MATT: 18 damage?

1080
01:07:12,776 --> 01:07:14,236
LAURA: 18, does that hit?

1081
01:07:14,236 --> 01:07:15,496
MATT: That does hit, yeah.

1082
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:16,958
LAURA: Okay.

1083
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:18,733
SAM: Come on, insta-kill this thing.

1084
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:20,894
MARISHA: I know. I don't want to have to do
anything.

1085
01:07:20,894 --> 01:07:22,211
LAURA: 18.

1086
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:23,403
MATT: Okay.

1087
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:30,194
JOE: This is the paladin dilemma. I think I'm
going to save the spell slots. But I am going to

1088
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:32,084
swing at this guy.

1089
01:07:32,084 --> 01:07:33,253
MATT: Go for it.

1090
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:39,821
JOE: Okay, I'm going to swing my battleaxe,
Fane-Eater.

1091
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:42,665
MATT: Okay. So you get two attacks with that.

1092
01:07:42,665 --> 01:07:44,629
JOE: Great. Oh, okay. Well, one was 31.

1093
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:45,749
MATT: Yep.

1094
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:53,972
JOE: Oh, that's going to be nine, plus 14. That's
23 points of damage on the first one. And then

1095
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:58,386
second attack is going to be a 23.

1096
01:07:58,386 --> 01:07:59,617
MATT: That hits.

1097
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:04,213
JOE: And that's going to be 21 points of damage on
the second.

1098
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:10,845
MATT: All right. And with that, as soon as its
head peeks over the edge, two arrows (whooshing)

1099
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:17,329
under its throat, and you watch as an axe cuts
part of its head clean off, as it tries to make a

1100
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:21,512
noise, but the blade is caught in its throat and
prevents the air passage. As Fane-Eater is yanked

1101
01:08:21,512 --> 01:08:25,920
out of the side, you see the jagged edge of the
axe arc back, causing blood to splatter across the

1102
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,718
back, the wall behind him, as Arkhan goes in with a
second swipe. And with one clean cleave motion,

1103
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:38,167
the head falls and plummets into the ground. The
rest of the gloomstalker tumbles in, lifeless,

1104
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:43,442
into the rock. And you see as it lands, its wings
sprawl out and slowly the body begins to dissolve

1105
01:08:43,442 --> 01:08:45,406
into black smoke and shadow.

1106
01:08:45,406 --> 01:08:50,211
SAM: I run out and I say: Wait! Don't kill it! I'm
just kidding. It's fine.

1107
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:55,120
TALIESIN: Vox Machina, may we introduce you to
Arkhan?

1108
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,747
SAM: Arkhan?

1109
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:57,949
MARISHA: Arkhan.

1110
01:08:57,949 --> 01:08:58,946
SAM: Hi.

1111
01:08:58,946 --> 01:09:04,475
MARISHA: You look like you've, you know-- You look
like us. You got more stuff. We've acquired more

1112
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:06,474
stuff, over the years. That's cool.

1113
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:07,810
SAM: How do you know this gentleman?

1114
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,167
TALIESIN: We did some work, ages ago.

1115
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:11,091
MARISHA: Yeah, forever. Before we really knew any
of you.

1116
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,335
JOE: The temple of Shumash.

1117
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:13,604
LAURA: How did you get here?

1118
01:09:13,604 --> 01:09:16,187
MARISHA: It was a crappy swamp. It was good times.
Yeah.

1119
01:09:16,187 --> 01:09:18,078
MATT: Technically it was a desert, but yeah.

1120
01:09:18,078 --> 01:09:20,545
MARISHA: It was a crappy desert. Good times.

1121
01:09:20,545 --> 01:09:23,034
SAM: Well, it was the worst kind of swamp. It was
one with no water.

1122
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,171
MARISHA: It was, yes. The driest of swamps, yeah.

1123
01:09:26,171 --> 01:09:28,324
TALIESIN: What are you doing here?

1124
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:40,377
JOE: That's a long story. Weeks ago, we wound up
attacked by a cult, my companions and I. This cult

1125
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:45,886
was led by a Death Knight. And a sorcerous
woman.

1126
01:09:45,886 --> 01:09:47,448
SAM: Lady Briarwood.

1127
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:49,091
MARISHA: Sylas?

1128
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:55,489
JOE: And then Vecna followed. And we were
ambushed. My companions and I were marked for

1129
01:09:55,489 --> 01:10:03,443
death. They were all destroyed. And I watched that
Death Knight burn the closest thing I've ever had

1130
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:12,977
to a brother. And he cut the still-beating heart
out of our goliath. And then these buzzards came

1131
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:21,763
to pick my bones, thinking I was dead. But I
wouldn't die. The queen had another plan for me.

1132
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:26,829
SAM: The queen? What kind of queen?

1133
01:10:26,829 --> 01:10:28,317
JOE: I hold up my shield.

1134
01:10:28,317 --> 01:10:30,775
MATT: Make a religion check, Scanlan.

1135
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:35,702
SAM: Hm, that's no good. 11?

1136
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:42,621
MATT: You have passing knowledge that the symbols
that adorn both around Arkhan's throat and the

1137
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:50,576
shield that he holds up are that of the Scaled
Tyrant, Tiamat, which is the patron god to

1138
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:53,786
chromatic and evil dragons all across the world.

1139
01:10:53,786 --> 01:10:59,010
LAURA: Oh, he's evil. That's evil. That's the evil
dragon. Potentially.

1140
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:00,575
SAM: You serve this queen?

1141
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:02,271
TALIESIN: He's our kind of evil. It's fine.

1142
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:08,123
JOE: I understand that because of my dogma, we
belong to groups that would never mix, but I can

1143
01:11:08,123 --> 01:11:14,240
assure you, if you help me get revenge on the one
that killed my friends, I swear to you, I will

1144
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:18,214
fight for your lives with the fury of a man who is
already dead.

1145
01:11:18,214 --> 01:11:21,447
TALIESIN: I think we have a surprising amount
already in common.

1146
01:11:21,447 --> 01:11:23,196
TRAVIS: Good pitch.

1147
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:27,428
SAM: Devil's advocate: maybe not. I don't know,
maybe--

1148
01:11:27,428 --> 01:11:30,283
LIAM: I mean, I'm just going to do an insight
check on principle.

1149
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:34,413
JOE: I make the gloomstalker snarl at the two
Scanlans.

1150
01:11:34,413 --> 01:11:36,708
MATT: (snarls)

1151
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,022
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled an eight. He checks out.

1152
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:49,404
MARISHA: Quick question. We didn't roll our
temporary hit points for our Heroes' Feast.

1153
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:51,396
MATT: Oh, you did not. You should do that.

1154
01:11:51,396 --> 01:11:53,354
MARISHA: Can we do that? Or does Pike do that for
us?

1155
01:11:53,354 --> 01:11:55,316
MATT: Yeah, Pike, you roll the temporary hit
points.

1156
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:59,508
MARISHA: For all of us, right? It's an additional
2d10, I'm pretty sure.

1157
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:02,665
MATT: So roll 2d10, Pike. And everyone who was
present for that--

1158
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:05,621
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you should give us a speech. How
long does that last?

1159
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,855
MARISHA: Oh, I totally should've given a speech.

1160
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:10,086
LIAM: That's a ten-minute one, yeah?

1161
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:13,973
MARISHA: No, it's a short rest thing. But it's a
thing that lasts until--

1162
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:15,553
LAURA: Later, then.

1163
01:12:15,553 --> 01:12:18,187
MARISHA: Yeah. I should've done that before, but
I'll do it next time.

1164
01:12:18,187 --> 01:12:20,291
SAM: Whatcha doing over there, Johnson?

1165
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:21,987
ASHLEY: I'm just looking for my tens!

1166
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:25,582
LAURA: Oh no!

1167
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:26,692
LIAM: Two ones.

1168
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:27,741
MARISHA: Two ones?

1169
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:28,835
ASHLEY: Wait, are these 12s?

1170
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:30,280
LAURA: No, those are tens.

1171
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,037
MATT: All right. So you guys gain two additional
hit points, to your max hit points.

1172
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:36,943
LAURA: That is such a bummer.

1173
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:39,198
JOE: Is that everybody?

1174
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:43,554
MATT: Yeah. You weren't there for the meal,
unfortunately. It's from earlier.

1175
01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:45,851
LAURA: It's okay; the meal didn't do a lot,
apparently.

1176
01:12:45,851 --> 01:12:49,503
ASHLEY: So glad I'm here to be useful.

1177
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:54,529
MATT: However, everyone does still have their
advantage on wisdom saving throws and you're

1178
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:57,991
immune to fear. Which is pretty huge.

1179
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:59,254
MARISHA: And poison.

1180
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:02,703
MATT: And poison. The hit points are more of,
like, a bonus. You're fine.

1181
01:13:02,703 --> 01:13:04,009
LIAM: It was slim fast. Slim feast.

1182
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,836
MATT and MARISHA: Slim feast!

1183
01:13:05,836 --> 01:13:07,583
JOE: Can I feed this thing a healing potion?

1184
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,902
MATT: You may.

1185
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:12,681
ASHLEY: I really thought I was going to roll two
tens.

1186
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:14,007
JOE: Greater? I think greater.

1187
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:15,252
MATT: If you have, yeah--

1188
01:13:15,252 --> 01:13:16,151
JOE: I have a greater.

1189
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:18,490
MATT: So that would be 4d4 plus four.

1190
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,924
ASHLEY: I rolled the wrong, I actually rolled the
wrong tens.

1191
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:25,203
JOE: That's nine; that's not great.

1192
01:13:25,203 --> 01:13:29,252
SAM: No, that's not great. We'll figure it out
later.

1193
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:30,860
TALIESIN: We know Lay on Hands and some such.

1194
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,605
JOE: Well, I have them, I just don't want to blow
them.

1195
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:33,909
TRAVIS: Wait. You can't die?

1196
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:37,348
SAM: Is that true? Wait, when did he say he
couldn't die?

1197
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:40,347
TRAVIS: Well, he said, like, "She thought I was
dead, but my queen--"

1198
01:13:40,347 --> 01:13:43,067
SAM: He said he would fight like a man who is
dead, but he wasn't--

1199
01:13:43,067 --> 01:13:44,591
TALIESIN: It was a metaphor, Grog. It was a
metaphor.

1200
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,052
SAM: Oh, no, you're right.

1201
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:48,390
LIAM: Do you mean actually; have you died?

1202
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:54,524
JOE: It's kind of a colloquialism for religious
folk. You know what I mean? Like, I hit a death save.

1203
01:13:54,524 --> 01:13:56,852
LAURA: Oh, tight, tight, tight, tight.

1204
01:13:56,852 --> 01:14:00,532
SAM: I touch him to see if he's real.

1205
01:14:00,532 --> 01:14:06,569
JOE: I blow smoke out of my nostrils, like a
little fire.

1206
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:10,333
SAM: Kind of squishy. Really soft.

1207
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,168
TRAVIS: Thank god he's wearing that armor, huh?

1208
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:14,215
SAM: Yeah. Pudgy.

1209
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:20,608
JOE: I'm going to pump 30, then, back into this
gloomstalker. Plus the nine. So there was, what,

1210
01:14:20,608 --> 01:14:21,920
51 that came off?

1211
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,713
MATT: 50 points of damage were taken off.

1212
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,510
JOE: 50 points, so I put 39 back on, so that's 11
off.

1213
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,842
MATT: Yep, you got it.

1214
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:30,506
TRAVIS: When do we want to do Freedom of Movement
stuff? Not yet?

1215
01:14:30,506 --> 01:14:31,586
LIAM: That's short term.

1216
01:14:31,586 --> 01:14:38,519
LAURA: Right before. That only lasts for an hour.
Here's the thing. Do we go for the outer walls to

1217
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:44,183
take out the shield first? Probably. Once we go
in, we're going in.

1218
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:45,897
SAM: The outer walls of the city?

1219
01:14:45,897 --> 01:14:47,511
LAURA: Of Thar Amphala, yes.

1220
01:14:47,511 --> 01:14:49,281
SAM: How are we going to take down entire walls
without being--

1221
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,547
LAURA: We don't have to take out the walls. We
have to break a couple of the crystals.

1222
01:14:51,547 --> 01:14:56,065
MARISHA: Yeah, those crystals that we started to
break when we were in the Shadowfell.

1223
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:59,541
TALIESIN: If just do a hit and run, we can cause
so much chaos that all of these gloomstalkers are

1224
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,519
going to be busy dealing with everything in the
air.

1225
01:15:01,519 --> 01:15:06,767
LAURA: Hey! You remember our old plan of just set
everything on fire? Let's set everything on fire!

1226
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:12,831
MARISHA: Yeah! In fact, that's actually a
brilliant plan. We could disable a crystal, maybe

1227
01:15:12,831 --> 01:15:17,630
I could light a signal, distract people. While
they're distracted, we make it to the next one.

1228
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:21,068
TALIESIN: And as long as we're close to that one,
they don't know that we're here. They can't see us.

1229
01:15:21,068 --> 01:15:22,339
JOE: What are these crystals?

1230
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:25,406
SAM: We don't know where these crystals are!

1231
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:28,428
TALIESIN: They're all around the outer wall.

1232
01:15:28,428 --> 01:15:30,287
LAURA: We saw them when we were in the city
before.

1233
01:15:30,287 --> 01:15:35,084
MARISHA: Yeah, in the Shadowfell. Remember, we
jabbed at one, and decided against it.

1234
01:15:35,084 --> 01:15:36,397
SAM: All right.

1235
01:15:36,397 --> 01:15:38,797
TALIESIN: If we break these crystals, this could
help--

1236
01:15:38,797 --> 01:15:40,178
MARISHA: Everything.

1237
01:15:40,178 --> 01:15:43,326
TRAVIS: Does anyone know that you're here?

1238
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:48,923
JOE: Vecna. The female wizardess.

1239
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,473
LAURA: She knows?

1240
01:15:50,473 --> 01:15:52,145
JOE: And the Death Knight.

1241
01:15:52,145 --> 01:15:56,104
TALIESIN: And if they've been watching, he just
vanished. We should run now.

1242
01:15:56,104 --> 01:15:58,730
JOE: But they thought I was dead. They left me for
dead.

1243
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:02,780
LAURA: So they don't necessarily know you're in the
city.

1244
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,050
JOE: I think they'd be surprised to see me.

1245
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,549
LAURA: Okay. All right, cool.

1246
01:16:06,549 --> 01:16:07,706
MARISHA: Let's move.

1247
01:16:07,706 --> 01:16:11,534
LAURA: Okay, stealthily, let's try to make it to
the outer wall so that we can cut out some of

1248
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:12,677
these crystals.

1249
01:16:12,677 --> 01:16:16,770
MATT: Okay. First off, make a perception check as
you glance out to see how close you are to the

1250
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,067
nearby wall.

1251
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:20,858
LAURA: 30.

1252
01:16:20,858 --> 01:16:26,853
MATT: 30, okay. You notice you're on a different
part of the city than you were previously. If the

1253
01:16:26,853 --> 01:16:35,831
city's moving forward, if you consider the
direction that the titan is traversing

1254
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:44,257
forward, you guys were to the back and right side
of Thar Amphala. Like a clock; if twelve o'clock

1255
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:50,225
is where it was traveling, you guys were around
four or five o'clock. Looking now at the layout of

1256
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:58,084
the city, you're closer to 11 and 12 right now.
And you're maybe about 200 feet from the nearest

1257
01:16:58,084 --> 01:17:03,303
wall. You can see the curvature of the dome is
pretty striking from your current position. And

1258
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:09,540
you can see the pulses, the waves. Imagine like a
reverse waterfall of energy shooting upward. And

1259
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,449
every now and then, there's a burst.

1260
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:16,336
LAURA: Does it look like there's an area that the
pulses are brighter, along the wall?

1261
01:17:16,336 --> 01:17:21,879
MATT: Yes. You do see the pulses aren't universal.
There are certain locations, about six of them

1262
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:25,383
throughout the city, that you occasionally see
them (bursting), and they spread out.

1263
01:17:25,383 --> 01:17:26,749
LAURA: Are we close to one of those pulses?

1264
01:17:26,749 --> 01:17:29,654
MATT: You can maneuver there. It's not directly
behind you, but you can eventually get to that

1265
01:17:29,654 --> 01:17:30,693
location, yeah.

1266
01:17:30,693 --> 01:17:33,332
LAURA: Okay. I see where one of the crystals is;
let's move towards that.

1267
01:17:33,332 --> 01:17:37,055
TALIESIN: We'll get Grog to smash it to
smithereens.

1268
01:17:37,055 --> 01:17:38,697
TRAVIS: I smash (stumbling) mitheens.

1269
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:41,380
ASHLEY: You do. To mitheens.

1270
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,725
TRAVIS: (drawn out) Mitheens.

1271
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,332
TALIESIN: You're so good at punching walls.

1272
01:17:44,332 --> 01:17:48,463
MATT: All right. I would like you all to make a
stealth check. Are you all walking on foot? Are

1273
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,969
you taking the gloomstalker?

1274
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:51,086
JOE: I'm on top of the gloomstalker.

1275
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:52,443
SAM: Is it walking?

1276
01:17:52,443 --> 01:17:53,434
MATT: Yeah.

1277
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:55,074
JOE: It's walking right now?

1278
01:17:55,074 --> 01:17:57,427
MATT: It's currently walking, unless you want to
hover with it.

1279
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:59,733
SAM: You got to stay within 60 feet of us? 30
feet?

1280
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:01,139
MATT: 60 feet.

1281
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:02,250
JOE: I'd like to hover.

1282
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:09,286
MATT: As you guys are staying lowkey, Arkhan is
currently riding against the back of this

1283
01:18:09,286 --> 01:18:14,820
gloomstalker as it's hovering in the air above. And
the stealth check you're going to be rolling is

1284
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:19,862
going to be to see whether or not anything notices
you on the back of a gloomstalker. The

1285
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:24,447
gloomstalker is not going to register on the radar
of any of the current watching creatures, because

1286
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,113
it's part of its posse for the moment.

1287
01:18:27,113 --> 01:18:30,221
JOE: So is this with disadvantage for plate armor,
or not?

1288
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:32,735
MATT: I would say no, because it isn't a
movement-based stealth check; you're just trying

1289
01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:34,083
to stay still.

1290
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,384
JOE: With the bonus.

1291
01:18:35,384 --> 01:18:36,457
LAURA: Plus ten.

1292
01:18:36,457 --> 01:18:40,823
JOE: Love it. Good. 31.

1293
01:18:40,823 --> 01:18:47,764
MATT: Shit, all right. You're just clutching the
exterior of it, trying to stay low. You're pulling

1294
01:18:47,854 --> 01:18:54,279
into your armor like a turtle shell, since it is
black. And using that to try and blend into its form

1295
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:57,097
SAM: And can we kind of stay under the shadow of
the gloomstalker?

1296
01:18:57,097 --> 01:18:58,473
MATT: You guys can move along.

1297
01:18:58,473 --> 01:19:00,214
SAM: Oh, 29 and 20.

1298
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:01,316
TALIESIN: 34.

1299
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:02,350
MATT: Keyleth?

1300
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:03,345
MARISHA: 32.

1301
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:04,211
MATT: Vax?

1302
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:06,142
LIAM: I rolled a four, so it's 37.

1303
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:07,404
MATT: Fucking rogue.

1304
01:19:07,404 --> 01:19:08,468
LAURA: 29.

1305
01:19:08,468 --> 01:19:09,482
ASHLEY: 18.

1306
01:19:09,482 --> 01:19:10,423
TRAVIS: What?

1307
01:19:10,423 --> 01:19:13,686
ASHLEY: No, I did it wrong.

1308
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:14,942
TRAVIS: Oh. 19.

1309
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:16,071
MATT: Okay.

1310
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,648
SAM: His head has muscles.

1311
01:19:17,648 --> 01:19:24,026
MATT: Okay. A five and a six. All right, so. As you
guys begin to maneuver through the streets,

1312
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:28,849
dodging from building to building, on the
outskirts of Thar Amphala, thankfully, the streets

1313
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:33,488
are a little more sparse on the edges. You also
notice as you're traversing, and this is

1314
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:35,137
interesting.

1315
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:40,818
JOE: It's his head shot.

1316
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:45,819
LAURA: I would have liked if he had signed it.

1317
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:49,163
JOE: It's Arkhan's commercial head shot.

1318
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:51,307
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to print one
in black and white.

1319
01:19:51,307 --> 01:19:53,933
LIAM: (deep voice) If I'm good at reproductions.

1320
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:56,554
JOE: This is, like, work in the office look.

1321
01:19:56,554 --> 01:20:00,091
MARISHA: (laughing) That's such an L.A. joke,
yeah.

1322
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:06,226
MATT: All right, so. As you guys are maneuvering,
Vax, Vex, and Keyleth as well. You have the high

1323
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:12,614
passive perception of the group. You notice that
the droves of undead that have been clogging the

1324
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:17,057
streets of this city, and the clusters of cultists
that have been running about busily, running from

1325
01:20:17,057 --> 01:20:22,531
location to location, with some work on their
midst. The undead, who were just scattered and

1326
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:30,220
wandering, are now unified and moving in patterns.
They're now being driven by some intent. Whereas

1327
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:36,301
once they were just scattered amongst, and in a
holding pattern, now they're maneuvering with

1328
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:42,438
solid purpose, away from the sides of the wall,
and the shields, which enables you to go

1329
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:49,854
relatively unnoticed. But you're seeing them now,
gathering towards similar tunnels to the one you

1330
01:20:49,854 --> 01:20:57,221
came up in. You can see dozens and dozens of
zombies and skeletons, and the occasional robed

1331
01:20:57,221 --> 01:21:03,129
cultist, both warrior and mage alike, all
beginning to make their way down into the titan,

1332
01:21:03,129 --> 01:21:05,000
at various points in the city.

1333
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,322
SAM: Making their way <i>down</i>.

1334
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:08,350
TALIESIN: They're going to go attack the city.

1335
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:11,698
LAURA: We got to get these shields down so that
Vasselheim can actually have--

1336
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,887
MARISHA and LIAM: A fighting chance.

1337
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:16,120
TRAVIS: Let's find the crystals.

1338
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,409
MARISHA: All right, let's do it.

1339
01:21:17,409 --> 01:21:23,347
MATT: As you guys make your way around the edge of
the city, you follow these pulses. They occur

1340
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:27,447
every two minutes or so, so you have to keep an
eye out for it until one happens and then reorient

1341
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:34,847
your direction, but you taking point on this, you
lead everybody, darting from place to place. Man.

1342
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:37,292
Rolling shitty-ass perception.

1343
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,404
TRAVIS: That's okay, Matt.

1344
01:21:38,404 --> 01:21:39,671
MATT: That's okay for you guys.

1345
01:21:39,671 --> 01:21:40,963
TRAVIS: Let it happen.

1346
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:47,622
MATT: Eventually, you come around one cluster of
exterior buildings. It looks to be what was once a

1347
01:21:47,622 --> 01:21:53,509
manor, that was converted to a fortress. Like a
small exterior fortress to this inner circle of

1348
01:21:53,509 --> 01:22:00,137
Thar Amphala. You curve around and there you see,
familiar to you from once before, the walls that

1349
01:22:00,137 --> 01:22:05,768
surround the exterior of this inner sanctum of
Thar Amphala, and the basis of this field that

1350
01:22:05,768 --> 01:22:13,394
contains the entirety of the city. Looking at the
wall, you can already feel the dangerous vibration

1351
01:22:13,394 --> 01:22:19,972
of this field being so close. There's this violent
hum to the air, that with each pulse hits this

1352
01:22:19,972 --> 01:22:26,207
certain frequency of sound that causes your ear to
tweak just a hint. And you can see violent waves

1353
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:33,500
of green-blue magical energy, (pulsing) up the
side of the wall, like a very powerful reverse

1354
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:40,814
waterfall. Shooting up, to gather and maintain
this field. You cannot see the crest. The crest

1355
01:22:40,814 --> 01:22:45,700
was visible from the outside of the wall. And the
energy field is being produced on the outside of

1356
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:51,030
the wall. You're on the inside of it. But you can
gather the base location of where this burst is

1357
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,436
happening to get an idea of loosely where it might
be.

1358
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:55,352
LAURA: How thick is the wall?

1359
01:22:55,352 --> 01:22:57,040
MATT: You don't know.

1360
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,394
LAURA: And we saw the crest before because there
was a doorway in the outer wall.

1361
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:03,505
MATT: Correct. Yes.

1362
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:05,225
LAURA: Is there any kind of doorway around us?

1363
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:08,577
MATT: You glance over to where the door was, below
the crest, before, and you can see the opposite

1364
01:23:08,577 --> 01:23:15,532
side of a door, currently, yes. It is shut. And
appears to be made of hard wood with-- It's iron

1365
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,139
bar reinforced crosshatch.

1366
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:21,380
LIAM: Well, we can try the door, and then if that
doesn't work, Grog can make a new one.

1367
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,144
LAURA: Yeah.

1368
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:24,532
LIAM: Let me check out the door.

1369
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:34,872
TRAVIS: I'm not really so keen on <i>making</i> doors,
as opposed to knocking them down. I'm a craftsman.

1370
01:23:34,872 --> 01:23:36,510
All right. I'm just, me.

1371
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:38,617
LIAM: I'm going to check and see if the door is
trapped.

1372
01:23:38,617 --> 01:23:40,288
LAURA: How are you with doors?

1373
01:23:40,288 --> 01:23:41,845
JOE: Pretty good.

1374
01:23:41,845 --> 01:23:45,383
TRAVIS and JOE: Yeah!

1375
01:23:45,383 --> 01:23:46,753
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Sh!

1376
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,565
LIAM: 26.

1377
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,505
MATT: Thankfully only rolled a nine.

1378
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:59,426
LIAM: 26 for investigation on the door.

1379
01:23:59,426 --> 01:24:01,661
MATT: The door is locked, but it is not trapped.

1380
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:03,362
LIAM: All right. Let's open it up.

1381
01:24:03,362 --> 01:24:06,765
JOE: I hand Grog some jerky from my pouch.
Hungry?

1382
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:09,602
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck yeah. Don't share it.

1383
01:24:09,602 --> 01:24:13,586
LIAM: 28.

1384
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:22,674
MATT: 28, okay. So the door (clicks). And it's
interesting, as you put your lockpicks in to feel

1385
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:28,700
the tumblers, you can feel the metal vibrating.
Like the entire door is just (buzzes). And as you

1386
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:32,521
hit it, and the door swings open, almost like
something's been pushing it on the opposite side.

1387
01:24:32,521 --> 01:24:39,131
It swings open and slams on the inside of the
frame, and there you're looking at a wall of

1388
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:45,393
violent green arcane energy. (whoosh) Coasting
by-- Actually, this is blasting downward right

1389
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:50,043
now, because the threshold crest, as you recall,
was above the doorway, in the wall.

1390
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,122
LAURA: Can we see it? Like above the doorway?

1391
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:53,412
MATT: No, it's flush.

1392
01:24:53,412 --> 01:24:54,688
LAURA: It's like on the other side?

1393
01:24:54,688 --> 01:24:56,925
MATT: It's on the other side and up on the wall.
And currently where the door opens, there is

1394
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,364
violent magical energy slamming down.

1395
01:24:59,364 --> 01:25:03,972
LAURA: Do you think it's possible to, like, punch
up on the archway and knock the crystal down?

1396
01:25:03,972 --> 01:25:09,714
LIAM: I pick up a rock about that big, walk ten
feet back, and throw it at the energy.

1397
01:25:09,714 --> 01:25:14,916
MATT: It hits the field, and there's a violent
flash in that section, about a foot radius around

1398
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:18,886
where it was, and the rock shoots past you. Make a
dexterity saving throw.

1399
01:25:18,886 --> 01:25:24,475
LIAM: Ooh, that's not good. 16.

1400
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:29,247
MATT: 16? Strange. Wow! That's the first time
you've failed a dex save in a long time!

1401
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:30,439
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a three.

1402
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:31,670
MATT: Oh, thank god.

1403
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:34,441
LAURA: So happy about it.

1404
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:35,906
MARISHA: You are fallible.

1405
01:25:35,906 --> 01:25:44,237
MATT: You take six points of bludgeoning damage.
That's a d4 plus two. But it literally pelts you

1406
01:25:44,237 --> 01:25:49,154
in the side of jaw and the neck, and you turn
around and feel it. And you can feel the pulsing

1407
01:25:49,154 --> 01:25:51,733
of the blood begin to flow into the bruise that's
going to be there tomorrow.

1408
01:25:51,733 --> 01:25:57,206
LIAM: I literally just got choked to death 18 hours
ago, so I'm not sweating it. What're we going to do?

1409
01:25:57,206 --> 01:26:00,010
TALIESIN: Grog? Let's start drilling up.

1410
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,662
LAURA: Try punching up.

1411
01:26:01,662 --> 01:26:06,549
SAM: All right, but if we interfere with that
forcefield and it somehow hits us, we're going to

1412
01:26:06,549 --> 01:26:07,650
be hurting.

1413
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:11,367
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Not only should we back up a
little bit, except for me, we should also have an

1414
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:14,944
area that we're going to run to, right? Because
I'm sure this will bring the noise.

1415
01:26:14,944 --> 01:26:19,036
MARISHA and LAURA: Is there a house nearby?

1416
01:26:19,036 --> 01:26:22,277
MATT: There's about a 20 foot gap between the wall
and any nearby building, and there is the large,

1417
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:29,516
fortress-like manor that you saw earlier. I mean,
I say fortress-like manor; it's not a huge house.

1418
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:35,015
It's two story and a decent size. But it looks
like it's been reinforced in the walls, like

1419
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:39,098
somebody had designed for it to be a place to hold
off some sort of a stand, probably from the war

1420
01:26:39,098 --> 01:26:43,218
with Pelor's army, long ago. That's the closest
thing to this doorway.

1421
01:26:43,218 --> 01:26:46,783
LAURA: Okay, we can get ready to run there.
However, we're staying within 60 feet of you while

1422
01:26:46,783 --> 01:26:47,831
you're punching.

1423
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:49,608
TRAVIS: Arkhan's going to stay, just in case it
needs, like, a double--

1424
01:26:49,608 --> 01:26:50,768
LAURA: A double punch.

1425
01:26:50,768 --> 01:26:51,799
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know.

1426
01:26:51,799 --> 01:26:54,591
MATT: It's probably more than 20 feet, actually;
it's probably like 30, 40 feet.

1427
01:26:54,591 --> 01:26:55,611
LAURA: 30 feet away?

1428
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:56,712
MATT: Yeah.

1429
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,646
JOE: How many gloomstalker riders are in the sky
above?

1430
01:26:59,646 --> 01:27:03,923
MATT: I mean, overall? Make a perception check.

1431
01:27:03,923 --> 01:27:12,299
JOE: Okay. Yikes. Eight.

1432
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:14,946
MATT: There's a lot of them.

1433
01:27:14,946 --> 01:27:16,603
TRAVIS: Sky's clear.

1434
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:20,099
MATT: Like, there's a lot of them by Entropis.

1435
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:22,033
JOE: Gloomstalker shit hits me in the face.

1436
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:31,415
MATT: Yeah. But you do notice that there's-- where
previously there wasn't, there's a cloud gathering at the

1437
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:35,699
top of this dome funneling down onto Entropis.

1438
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:39,438
TRAVIS: Actually. Well, hold on. You got to stay
here, right? Because of the--

1439
01:27:39,438 --> 01:27:41,911
LAURA: That's what I said; I'm staying within 60
feet of you.

1440
01:27:41,911 --> 01:27:43,351
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

1441
01:27:43,351 --> 01:27:44,350
MATT: Okay.

1442
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:48,254
TRAVIS: And I go: Tiger Uppercut! and I just punch
the roof of it.

1443
01:27:48,254 --> 01:27:50,618
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack.

1444
01:27:50,618 --> 01:27:53,288
LIAM: Destroy.

1445
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:55,310
TRAVIS: Yeah, destroy. 23.

1446
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,637
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage, d4 plus
your strength modifier.

1447
01:27:58,637 --> 01:28:05,373
TRAVIS: That is 15. Just by itself. So.

1448
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:08,409
MATT: Times two. That's 30 points of damage with a
punch.

1449
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:10,705
SAM: One Punch Man.

1450
01:28:10,705 --> 01:28:18,295
MATT: Fucking siege, man. That's good. As you slam
into it, you guys watch as, right above the

1451
01:28:18,295 --> 01:28:24,701
doorway, in the door frame, the entire wall-- Just
a spider crack shoots up about 20-- The wall is

1452
01:28:24,701 --> 01:28:30,967
about 30 feet tall or so. Actually, probably not.
It's about 20 or so feet. And it cracks up to the

1453
01:28:30,967 --> 01:28:36,274
very top, and you watch as large parts of it break
off and fall, but it hasn't completely collapsed.

1454
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:38,152
But it's sustained some very serious damage.

1455
01:28:38,152 --> 01:28:39,874
TALIESIN: One more and we run. And take cover.

1456
01:28:39,874 --> 01:28:40,917
TRAVIS: One more?

1457
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:42,116
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

1458
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:46,437
MATT: I also need you to go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw, please.

1459
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:49,541
LIAM: I'm going to walk up behind him--

1460
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,734
JOE: He's within ten feet of me. He gets a plus
four.

1461
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:54,248
LIAM: And plus two from me.

1462
01:28:54,248 --> 01:28:57,097
MATT: Awesome. Well, they don't stack.

1463
01:28:57,097 --> 01:28:58,213
LIAM: Doesn't stack?

1464
01:28:58,213 --> 01:28:59,409
MATT: The plus four is what you get.

1465
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:00,996
LIAM: Then I'm backing the fuck up.

1466
01:29:00,996 --> 01:29:03,410
MATT: From the aura.

1467
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:07,554
JOE: Aura of Protection. Provided by Tiamat!

1468
01:29:07,554 --> 01:29:09,499
TRAVIS: 24.

1469
01:29:09,499 --> 01:29:22,668
MATT: 24? All right. You suffer-- it would be 14
points of force damage, reduced to seven and you're

1470
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:28,330
pushed back 20 feet, but you're not knocked prone.
So as you slam into it, there's a burst of arcane

1471
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:32,780
energy out of that section of the doorway and wall
that slams into you. You go spinning past,

1472
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:36,132
spiraling, and you catch yourself on the ground
about 20 feet away, in the middle of the open

1473
01:29:36,132 --> 01:29:38,026
there. Catch yourself.

1474
01:29:38,026 --> 01:29:40,055
LIAM: Feet skidding, like a Jackie Chan film.

1475
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:43,376
MATT: Still don't fucking see you, okay.

1476
01:29:43,376 --> 01:29:45,851
TALIESIN: It's a very loud--

1477
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:48,143
MATT: I'm rolling so shitty today.

1478
01:29:48,143 --> 01:29:50,113
SAM: Yeah, well. You're going to roll well when it
counts.

1479
01:29:50,113 --> 01:29:51,341
JOE: I'll take a shot.

1480
01:29:51,341 --> 01:29:52,322
MATT: You take a shot as well?

1481
01:29:52,322 --> 01:29:53,171
JOE: Yeah.

1482
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:56,997
MATT: All right. So as Grog spins back and catches
himself, you walk up to this doorframe. With your

1483
01:29:56,997 --> 01:29:58,077
axe in hand?

1484
01:29:58,077 --> 01:29:58,913
JOE: Yeah.

1485
01:29:58,913 --> 01:30:00,305
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack.

1486
01:30:00,305 --> 01:30:04,686
JOE: Okay, that's going to be a 19.

1487
01:30:04,686 --> 01:30:06,105
MATT: 19 hits.

1488
01:30:06,105 --> 01:30:07,533
LAURA: 19 hits a wall!

1489
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:09,484
MATT: It's an AC of 18 on the wall.

1490
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:12,180
SAM: The wall has an AC of 18?

1491
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,094
TALIESIN: The wall has my armor class. That's
really horrifying.

1492
01:30:15,094 --> 01:30:17,659
JOE: With my axe--

1493
01:30:17,659 --> 01:30:18,695
MATT: It's solid!

1494
01:30:18,695 --> 01:30:20,247
LAURA: It's a magic wall.

1495
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,708
JOE: That's going to be 20 points of damage.

1496
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:26,376
MATT: 20 points of damage, that'll do it. So as
Grog catches up, and look up, you watch as Arkhan

1497
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:32,014
rushes forward, and with a giant leap, cleaves the
axe into the stone. As it does, the archway

1498
01:30:32,014 --> 01:30:34,802
collapses downward. First off, make a constitution
saving throw.

1499
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:38,505
TRAVIS: I'm standing there like a catcher, ready.

1500
01:30:38,505 --> 01:30:50,606
JOE: Con save? All right. Not big money. This is
not. It's going to be more whammy than big

1501
01:30:50,606 --> 01:30:55,809
money. That's a nine on a con save.

1502
01:30:55,809 --> 01:31:03,199
MATT: That's not going to do it. Okay. You suffer
16 points of force damage, and you get blown back

1503
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:07,402
into Grog's direction and knocked prone. So you
catch, but the impact actually pushes you back

1504
01:31:07,402 --> 01:31:13,272
five feet, and he falls face first on the ground.
There's actually a dig in the ground, like a

1505
01:31:13,272 --> 01:31:20,894
groove where the impact is. At that point, as you
watch the wall crumble and collapse, you see,

1506
01:31:20,894 --> 01:31:27,938
suddenly dislodged from its position, the about
two and half foot wide threshold crest stone that

1507
01:31:27,938 --> 01:31:33,191
is embedded in the wall there crumples downward
and falls out of its space. As it does, there's a

1508
01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:39,231
series of bursts of vibrant arcane energy that
shoot up the wall, causing this side of the wall

1509
01:31:39,231 --> 01:31:45,588
to glow exponentially brighter than the rest of
the shield. At which point, like a large slice of

1510
01:31:45,588 --> 01:31:54,249
pie, one sixth of the dome falls inward, and for
the first time since you've arrived, you see the

1511
01:31:54,249 --> 01:32:01,779
non-filtered sky above of the darkened clouds that
have completely encased the upper atmosphere of

1512
01:32:01,779 --> 01:32:09,567
Othanzia. You also glance past where it crumbled,
as the city is at a slight angle forward, the way

1513
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:13,358
it's placed on the front of the titan, and you
look down and see, immediately around, the

1514
01:32:13,358 --> 01:32:19,504
familiar sight of the Vasper Timberlands that
surround the exterior of Vasselheim. And there

1515
01:32:19,504 --> 01:32:27,383
ahead, not more than maybe a few miles off, you
can assume from this distance, you see the

1516
01:32:27,383 --> 01:32:31,501
singular mountain pillar that Vasselheim is built
around, and the outer wall in sight.

1517
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:36,054
MARISHA: I don't know. Do we keep going? Do we try
to get down some more?

1518
01:32:36,054 --> 01:32:38,641
JOE: Alderaan is in sight!

1519
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:41,591
TRAVIS: We're coming around that planet.

1520
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:43,720
TALIESIN: We're going to run.

1521
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,266
MATT: Everyone make a perception check, please.

1522
01:32:47,266 --> 01:32:49,660
TRAVIS: I got this, guys; don't worry.

1523
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:52,463
JOE: Famous last words.

1524
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:55,142
MARISHA: Opal die, don't fuck me!

1525
01:32:55,142 --> 01:32:56,158
LAURA: 27?

1526
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:58,024
TALIESIN: 27.

1527
01:32:58,024 --> 01:32:59,123
SAM: 20.

1528
01:32:59,123 --> 01:33:04,405
JOE: Was this passive perception? Because if it
was, then I rolled a natural 20 of passive

1529
01:33:04,405 --> 01:33:09,260
perception. The natural one.

1530
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,568
MARISHA: 18.

1531
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:11,717
TRAVIS: Three.

1532
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:12,488
ASHLEY: 12.

1533
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:23,366
MATT: Okay. Those who got over 20: There's this
small victory, and this moment of joy, and

1534
01:33:23,366 --> 01:33:27,236
accomplishment, that is immediately washed over by
the realization of how close you are to the city.

1535
01:33:27,236 --> 01:33:35,770
The two hours that you were gone, still better
than a full rest, however, has put you within

1536
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:46,005
proximity of the city. And you hear this familiar,
large, airy, reedy, stretched screech in the

1537
01:33:46,005 --> 01:33:55,087
distance. You glance over, and you see in the
distance, barreling down in your direction, a

1538
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,958
skeletal dragon familiar to you not far before.

1539
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:59,198
MARISHA: Move, move, move!

1540
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:00,612
SAM: I don't think we're going to be able to
move.

1541
01:34:00,612 --> 01:34:01,899
LIAM: We can hide, though.

1542
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:03,253
TRAVIS: We're going to hide?

1543
01:34:03,253 --> 01:34:05,148
LIAM: We can't run.

1544
01:34:05,148 --> 01:34:10,659
LAURA: At least get in this building, there was
that encased part, right?

1545
01:34:10,659 --> 01:34:13,175
SAM: We're all in the same enclosed space?

1546
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:14,210
LIAM: Ring.

1547
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:20,207
MATT: There's a tower-like structure, and then
there's that building that was reinforced to be a--

1548
01:34:20,207 --> 01:34:22,572
TRAVIS: If he spots us, we scatter and spread,
but.

1549
01:34:22,572 --> 01:34:25,810
TALIESIN: We are not going to scatter and spread.
We're going to stay together no matter what.

1550
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:28,053
LAURA: We're going to stay within 60 feet of each
other.

1551
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,556
TALIESIN: There is no scattering.

1552
01:34:29,556 --> 01:34:32,509
LAURA: Within 60 feet of us. It's super
important!

1553
01:34:32,509 --> 01:34:36,563
MATT: If you all are rushing into this building,
everyone make a stealth check, please.

1554
01:34:36,563 --> 01:34:40,774
JOE: Is this a hovering stealth check?

1555
01:34:40,774 --> 01:34:46,068
MATT: If you want to still stay out in the open,
that is up to you. They're all darting into a

1556
01:34:46,068 --> 01:34:51,570
building, so the choice is yours. You can stay
with your beast.

1557
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:55,314
JOE: But he's one of them. So I can kind of leave
him outside somewhat.

1558
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:56,829
MATT: He is. You're on top of him.

1559
01:34:56,829 --> 01:34:57,903
JOE: Yeah, I am.

1560
01:34:57,903 --> 01:35:00,304
MATT: So. Do you want to try and blend into his
form?

1561
01:35:00,304 --> 01:35:04,011
JOE: I'd love to. I think that's what I want to
do.

1562
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:05,983
MATT: Okay. Then make a stealth check.

1563
01:35:05,983 --> 01:35:08,512
LAURA: If you're within 30 feet of me, you still
get plus ten.

1564
01:35:08,512 --> 01:35:11,766
MATT: You would not be within 30 feet of her once
she enters the building. So.

1565
01:35:11,766 --> 01:35:17,306
MARISHA: Can you do the cool John Wayne thing, and
go underneath of him, and hang on his belly from

1566
01:35:17,306 --> 01:35:18,308
the saddle?

1567
01:35:18,308 --> 01:35:19,426
JOE: Yeah. That's what I'm trying to do.

1568
01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:20,700
MATT: Make an athletics check.

1569
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:29,858
JOE: 28.

1570
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:38,567
MATT: As this happens, you immediately climb down
to the underbelly of the gloomstalker. To maintain

1571
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:41,797
hold on it, because its physical form-- and it's
interesting, now that you've been this close to

1572
01:35:41,797 --> 01:35:44,715
it, and you've been wrestling it, you feel it's
partially corporeal. There's something about its

1573
01:35:44,715 --> 01:35:52,805
physicality that is almost gelatinous. Like it's
made up of a combination of shadow and physical

1574
01:35:52,805 --> 01:36:00,092
will. And as you clutch into it, your fingers dig
and begin to seep into it, almost like a cluster

1575
01:36:00,092 --> 01:36:05,698
of tar. But it holds you fast, and you're there
underneath. Make a stealth check, without

1576
01:36:05,698 --> 01:36:07,445
disadvantage, but this will--

1577
01:36:07,445 --> 01:36:11,642
LAURA: Is it a boy or a girl gloomstalker?

1578
01:36:11,642 --> 01:36:14,394
JOE: I'm close enough to know.

1579
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:19,551
MATT: Gloomstalkers are actually sexless. They
have no natural--

1580
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:21,958
JOE: (whispers) It seems to be asexual. Oh, do I
have a little--?

1581
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,147
MATT: You do not.

1582
01:36:23,147 --> 01:36:24,370
JOE: (groans)

1583
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:30,334
LAURA: Oh no.

1584
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:33,407
JOE: This is going to be an 11.

1585
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:35,235
MATT: Okay. Good to know. The rest of you guys?

1586
01:36:35,235 --> 01:36:38,119
JOE: That was a shitty roll.

1587
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:39,219
TRAVIS: Oh, 16. No, 18.

1588
01:36:39,219 --> 01:36:40,239
LAURA: Add ten.

1589
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,180
TRAVIS: I did.

1590
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:42,231
ASHLEY: 22.

1591
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:43,436
LAURA: 33.

1592
01:36:43,436 --> 01:36:44,509
LIAM: 46.

1593
01:36:44,509 --> 01:36:45,548
MARISHA: 27.

1594
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:46,495
TALIESIN: 30.

1595
01:36:46,495 --> 01:36:47,575
SAM: 19 and 30.

1596
01:36:47,575 --> 01:36:48,465
MATT: Okay.

1597
01:36:48,465 --> 01:36:50,493
LAURA: No, 43.

1598
01:36:50,493 --> 01:36:57,676
MATT: Okay. As you guys all dart into this
building, you all quietly listen outside, as you

1599
01:36:57,676 --> 01:37:06,411
maintain, hovering in place. The skeletal dragon
(croaking) swoops down. As its wings catch itself,

1600
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:13,828
the wind billows through the space in the center
here. You can see a bunch of the dust and pebbles

1601
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:18,413
and loose rubble that's been built up around here,
and the wall that was left behind just gets kicked

1602
01:37:18,413 --> 01:37:24,738
up, and spins a brief dust devil in the vicinity.
The skeletal dragon there, still flying. Make a

1603
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:26,099
perception check.

1604
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:31,472
LAURA: But we're within 60 feet of him, right? You
said we weren't within 30.

1605
01:37:31,472 --> 01:37:32,803
MATT: He's kept relatively close to the building.

1606
01:37:32,803 --> 01:37:33,803
LAURA: Okay.

1607
01:37:33,803 --> 01:37:34,977
JOE: So I didn't get the plus ten.

1608
01:37:34,977 --> 01:37:35,943
LAURA and MATT: No.

1609
01:37:35,943 --> 01:37:39,540
LAURA: But you're still hidden from view from
Vecna.

1610
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:43,049
JOE: Perception. That's not terrible. That's a 16
perception.

1611
01:37:43,049 --> 01:37:47,990
MATT: Okay. As soon as the dragon gets close-- and
you've seen it flying about, up in the

1612
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:54,250
stratosphere area of this dome before-- you can
see there are still bits of flesh dangling off of

1613
01:37:54,250 --> 01:38:00,576
the bones. And it is a familiar-colored flesh.

1614
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,169
LAURA: (gasps)

1615
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:03,856
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh, no.

1616
01:38:03,856 --> 01:38:12,310
MATT: Whereas you and your adventuring party had
traveled here before, this risen dragon form

1617
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:17,928
seems to have been torn from the corpse of the
mount that brought you to this city.

1618
01:38:17,928 --> 01:38:20,362
JOE: Oh, no.

1619
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:27,812
MATT: You see, as the skull of its body, its eyes
crackling bright blue-green energy, there on the

1620
01:38:27,812 --> 01:38:34,049
back of this dragon, you see two humanoids
standing on its back. You see a dark armored male

1621
01:38:34,049 --> 01:38:39,582
with pale skin, with a well-kept beard and short
hair, with his arm around the waist of a female,

1622
01:38:39,582 --> 01:38:42,955
who's currently clutching onto the back of its
bones. You can see the woman, in a red robe that's

1623
01:38:42,955 --> 01:38:48,113
being blown up, her hair bound in the front, wild
behind, as she has a necklace bauble that hangs

1624
01:38:48,113 --> 01:38:52,633
around her neck, crackling blue-green energy. As
she has her hand forward, she glances around at

1625
01:38:52,633 --> 01:39:04,452
the space, angrily. "What!?" (heavy breathing)
Looks over at the gloomstalker. "Oh. What have we

1626
01:39:04,452 --> 01:39:11,497
"here? Is this your doing?"

1627
01:39:11,497 --> 01:39:19,184
SAM: Maybe she doesn't see you. Maybe she's
talking to the gloomstalker.

1628
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:22,707
JOE: I control the gloomstalker and make him
screech.

1629
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:31,299
MATT: (screeches) "Adorable. Wouldn't you say so,
honey?" And the man behind her goes, "Oh, quite.

1630
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:42,441
"Well, I'm a fan of taking thorns out of my side.
Is it time we do a bit of surgery, darling?" And

1631
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:46,704
the woman goes, "But of course. Oh, how I've
missed you." And she nuzzles into his neck a bit,

1632
01:39:46,704 --> 01:39:54,191
and turns around. The dragon lands onto the tower
across the way, facing in the direction of the

1633
01:39:54,191 --> 01:40:01,384
gloomstalker, and it inhales. And you watch as it
begins to breathe in, all of the shards of bone

1634
01:40:01,384 --> 01:40:06,943
matter that have been scattered across the streets
of the city begin to whip up and spiral into its

1635
01:40:06,943 --> 01:40:15,867
ribcage, like a blender. As it pulls back (roar)
and as the dragon's mouth opens it releases a

1636
01:40:15,867 --> 01:40:22,349
blast of bone shards that arc out in front of you.
You and the gloomstalker, each, I need--

1637
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:30,554
SAM: Into the earring I say, this is our chance,
we leave him as a distraction and we go. They don't

1638
01:40:30,554 --> 01:40:32,277
know we're here, we can run!

1639
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:34,651
MATT: You and the gloomstalker make a dexterity
saving throw please.

1640
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:38,665
LAURA: But here's the thing, we're not going to
have a better chance to get them away from Vecna.

1641
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:40,928
Should we attack them now?

1642
01:40:40,928 --> 01:40:43,054
TRAVIS: Plus we have one extra ally. Two!

1643
01:40:43,054 --> 01:40:44,798
LAURA: We can attack them now, away from Vecna.

1644
01:40:44,798 --> 01:40:46,036
JOE: You said dex save?

1645
01:40:46,036 --> 01:40:46,960
MATT: Correct.

1646
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:52,980
JOE: I actually have an advantage on dex saves
that I can see.

1647
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,361
MATT: There you go.

1648
01:40:54,361 --> 01:40:56,192
MARISHA: Maybe wait for them to land.

1649
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,542
SAM and LAURA: Are they landed?

1650
01:40:58,542 --> 01:40:59,789
SAM: Are they hovering?

1651
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:02,432
MATT: They've landed on a tower right across from
the building where you guys are.

1652
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:03,674
LAURA: How far away is that?

1653
01:41:03,674 --> 01:41:05,347
MATT: Let me show you.

1654
01:41:05,347 --> 01:41:08,405
(cheering)

1655
01:41:08,405 --> 01:41:10,464
TRAVIS: (shouting) Oh this is it! Oh no!

1656
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:13,074
SAM and ASHLEY: (airhorn sounds)

1657
01:41:13,074 --> 01:41:16,509
LAURA: Oh my god.

1658
01:41:16,509 --> 01:41:20,305
MARISHA: So wait, is it Vorugal? Is it Thordak?

1659
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:22,042
LIAM: No it's <i>his</i> mount.

1660
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:23,797
MARISHA: It's your old mount?

1661
01:41:23,797 --> 01:41:27,522
JOE: I rode in on a white dragon named Obakala.

1662
01:41:27,522 --> 01:41:30,070
(groaning)

1663
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:33,161
TALIESIN: (shouting) What? No!

1664
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:36,883
ALL: Ooh.

1665
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:38,460
LAURA: And they're on this?

1666
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,246
SAM: How did you know we would be here?

1667
01:41:40,246 --> 01:41:43,185
LAURA: How did he know we would be here?

1668
01:41:43,185 --> 01:41:44,847
MATT: I had a few possibilities.

1669
01:41:44,847 --> 01:41:49,949
LAURA: Oh, it's okay, Briarwoods down.

1670
01:41:49,949 --> 01:41:52,493
MARISHA: Bony dragon!

1671
01:41:52,493 --> 01:41:58,107
ASHLEY: They're dead! We did it!

1672
01:41:58,107 --> 01:42:00,732
MATT: If that was the way it went you guys would
have been dead a long time ago.

1673
01:42:00,732 --> 01:42:08,743
MARISHA: Wait, did you put a cool little acrylic
thing on there to make them mountable?

1674
01:42:08,743 --> 01:42:09,920
MATT: I did.

1675
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,249
MARISHA: That's pretty dope.

1676
01:42:11,249 --> 01:42:14,472
MATT: Currently riding your gloomstalker.

1677
01:42:14,472 --> 01:42:15,730
JOE: I'm on top of my dude?

1678
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:16,599
MATT: Yep.

1679
01:42:16,599 --> 01:42:20,272
JOE: Thank you John Paul and everyone at Gale
Force Nine for my sweet-ass mini that just arrived

1680
01:42:20,272 --> 01:42:21,919
from the UK today!

1681
01:42:21,919 --> 01:42:27,452
LAURA: So we're in this building?

1682
01:42:27,452 --> 01:42:31,299
JOE: Well I was kind of on the bottom, but we'll
let it--

1683
01:42:31,299 --> 01:42:35,700
MATT: Yeah well I'm putting it there because that's
the range of the blast right there.

1684
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:40,091
LAURA: Shit. Maybe he rolled really well on his
dex save.

1685
01:42:40,091 --> 01:42:45,685
MATT: All right, so you guys, let's go ahead and figure
out your placement here. You guys rushed into this

1686
01:42:45,685 --> 01:42:46,883
building here.

1687
01:42:46,883 --> 01:42:47,815
ASHLEY: There's a window.

1688
01:42:47,815 --> 01:42:51,457
LAURA: There's windows! Okay. Oh my god.

1689
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:55,800
MATT: You guys rushed around and into this side,
so you guys were in the base floor here.

1690
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,902
LAURA: Okay.

1691
01:42:56,902 --> 01:42:58,118
MATT: Where do you want to be?

1692
01:42:58,118 --> 01:43:00,039
LAURA: Can I run upstairs and look in that
window?

1693
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:02,613
MATT: Sure. So I'll put you at the window there.

1694
01:43:02,613 --> 01:43:03,838
LAURA: Okay.

1695
01:43:03,838 --> 01:43:05,045
MATT: Who else is placed where?

1696
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,371
MARISHA: I'll be downstairs.

1697
01:43:06,371 --> 01:43:08,955
SAM: There's no way to see out downstairs?

1698
01:43:08,955 --> 01:43:11,000
LIAM: There's no windows on this side.

1699
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:18,858
SAM: There seems to be some windows on this side,
right?

1700
01:43:18,858 --> 01:43:21,302
MATT: There's a couple of small slits, but they're
facing out this way.

1701
01:43:21,302 --> 01:43:26,022
LIAM: And then would you say we could use the
attic windows? It's up to you.

1702
01:43:26,022 --> 01:43:28,897
MATT: That's more for flavor. There would be no
attic windows. It's been reinforced, so there's

1703
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:32,947
been placed armor on the bottom, the only windows
that are available are the ones up top and even

1704
01:43:32,947 --> 01:43:34,340
then only have arrow slits.

1705
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:38,764
ASHLEY: Because we can't see around there, I'm
going to use it as a reference photo.

1706
01:43:38,764 --> 01:43:42,420
MATT: Fair enough. Vax, are you up with your
sister?

1707
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,607
LIAM: Yes I am.

1708
01:43:43,607 --> 01:43:44,716
LAURA: And Trinket is out.

1709
01:43:44,716 --> 01:43:45,987
MATT: All right, so you bamf Trinket out.

1710
01:43:45,987 --> 01:43:48,427
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out but he's down by Grog.

1711
01:43:48,427 --> 01:43:55,350
MATT: Okay, we'll put Grog-- we'll say that you
were probably down in this building being as quiet

1712
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:58,711
as you can. Percival, Scanlan, Keyleth, Pike.

1713
01:43:58,711 --> 01:44:02,329
ASHLEY: I'm behind my boy Grog. My boy Blue!

1714
01:44:02,329 --> 01:44:03,732
TALIESIN: There's that other window.

1715
01:44:03,732 --> 01:44:05,899
MATT: Up on the second level.

1716
01:44:05,899 --> 01:44:07,063
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1717
01:44:07,063 --> 01:44:08,586
MATT: Okay. So we'll put you up there.

1718
01:44:08,586 --> 01:44:17,716
ASHLEY: Guys, do not worry! We have an extra plus
two to our hit points! It's going to be fine!

1719
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:22,899
TRAVIS: Most amazing 2d10 roll ever.

1720
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:25,305
MATT: All right, Scanlan.

1721
01:44:25,305 --> 01:44:27,402
SAM: I mean I'm in there somewhere.

1722
01:44:27,402 --> 01:44:28,759
MATT: I need a second Scanlan.

1723
01:44:28,759 --> 01:44:33,207
MARISHA: Is Keyleth up top? Keyleth's up top,
okay.

1724
01:44:33,207 --> 01:44:38,308
SAM: I think I would be near the window where I
could kind of see-- what's your name, Ar-Can?

1725
01:44:38,308 --> 01:44:39,133
JOE: Arkhan.

1726
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:39,996
SAM: Arkhan?

1727
01:44:39,996 --> 01:44:40,747
JOE: Yeah.

1728
01:44:40,747 --> 01:44:42,246
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

1729
01:44:42,246 --> 01:44:45,898
SAM: He can just move with me, it's fine.

1730
01:44:45,898 --> 01:44:47,097
MATT: This will be tiny Scanlan.

1731
01:44:47,097 --> 01:44:47,897
SAM: Sure.

1732
01:44:47,897 --> 01:44:49,102
MATT: Scanlan where are you?

1733
01:44:49,102 --> 01:44:52,980
SAM: Near the downstairs windows where I can
see--

1734
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,593
LAURA: This is so intense!

1735
01:44:54,593 --> 01:44:56,859
MATT: Right here there's small slits, they're all
armored up.

1736
01:44:56,859 --> 01:44:58,669
SAM: Oh they're armored up, all right, so then I'm
upstairs.

1737
01:44:58,669 --> 01:45:03,788
MATT: All right, okay. We'll put that there. So
we'll say for the purposes of this you guys would be--

1738
01:45:03,788 --> 01:45:06,059
LAURA: I can't believe we're fighting the fucking
Briarwoods again!

1739
01:45:06,059 --> 01:45:07,626
TALIESIN: That's going to be fun.

1740
01:45:07,717 --> 01:45:09,115
JOE: That's not the Death Knight?

1741
01:45:09,115 --> 01:45:10,274
MATT: No.

1742
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:12,211
JOE: It's her dude?

1743
01:45:12,211 --> 01:45:13,698
MATT: Sure. So.

1744
01:45:13,698 --> 01:45:15,401
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's Lord Briarwood.

1745
01:45:15,401 --> 01:45:19,485
MATT: Now that we're set, thank you for your
patience. So what did you roll, you and your

1746
01:45:19,485 --> 01:45:20,681
gloomstalker?

1747
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:29,297
JOE: Well, me get not-- him not-- it not so good.
I had a 27. Gloomstalker 11. I'm trying to be--

1748
01:45:29,297 --> 01:45:32,577
give the proper gender-specific...

1749
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:34,358
SAM: They.

1750
01:45:34,358 --> 01:45:35,291
JOE: They?

1751
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:36,184
SAM: They.

1752
01:45:36,184 --> 01:45:45,712
JOE: Rolled an 11. Well, actually no. Wait, hold
on. They would benefit from my Aura of

1753
01:45:45,712 --> 01:45:46,773
Protection.

1754
01:45:46,773 --> 01:45:47,711
MATT: That's true.

1755
01:45:47,711 --> 01:45:49,800
JOE: So they would have a 15, I would have a 27.

1756
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,767
MATT: That's with their plus six? The gloomstalker
gets a plus six dexterity saving throw.

1757
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:57,791
JOE: Oh, plus six! I'm looking at the dex modifier
which is plus three.

1758
01:45:57,791 --> 01:46:02,778
MATT: Right. Says under saving throws, dex plus
six. Wait, does it? No, it's dex plus eight.

1759
01:46:02,778 --> 01:46:03,771
Sorry.

1760
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:04,670
LAURA: Oh shit.

1761
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,489
TRAVIS: Take it.

1762
01:46:05,489 --> 01:46:11,183
JOE: So then, it-- they had a 20. I had a 27.

1763
01:46:11,183 --> 01:46:16,779
MATT: All right. You both succeeded on the save so
you take half damage which is only 26 points of

1764
01:46:16,779 --> 01:46:18,265
necrotic damage.

1765
01:46:18,265 --> 01:46:19,489
TALIESIN: That's solid.

1766
01:46:19,489 --> 01:46:25,809
MATT: Sorry, piercing damage, not necrotic. So as
the bone shards go slamming into each of you, that

1767
01:46:25,809 --> 01:46:28,741
completes the dragon's turn. Now everybody please
roll initiative.

1768
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:29,944
(groans)

1769
01:46:29,944 --> 01:46:31,400
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on, come get some!

1770
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,833
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1771
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:36,633
JOE: You said 60, Matt?

1772
01:46:36,633 --> 01:46:39,349
MATT: 26.

1773
01:46:39,349 --> 01:46:42,777
JOE: Yeah, I got that right for there. 26.

1774
01:46:42,777 --> 01:46:46,083
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

1775
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:47,443
JOE: Do I roll for the thing?

1776
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:50,074
MATT: Yes, you would.

1777
01:46:50,074 --> 01:46:51,305
JOE: Separately of me.

1778
01:46:51,305 --> 01:46:57,546
MATT: Separately. I'll say for the ease of it
let's make it on your turn. There's a lot going on

1779
01:46:57,546 --> 01:46:58,942
here. All righty.

1780
01:46:58,942 --> 01:47:00,905
LAURA: In-game hour, not this game hour.

1781
01:47:00,905 --> 01:47:02,824
MARISHA: Right. No.

1782
01:47:02,824 --> 01:47:05,427
MATT: 25 to 20.

1783
01:47:05,427 --> 01:47:07,727
TRAVIS: Thanks to Kas, 27.

1784
01:47:07,727 --> 01:47:09,661
LAURA: Oh shit. 24 for me.

1785
01:47:09,661 --> 01:47:18,150
MATT: Right. 25 to 20? I just said that, right?

1786
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,492
LAURA: 24.

1787
01:47:19,492 --> 01:47:21,019
MATT: Yeah. 20 to 15?

1788
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:21,795
TALIESIN: 18.

1789
01:47:21,795 --> 01:47:22,580
JOE: 17.

1790
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:23,533
MATT: Nice.

1791
01:47:23,533 --> 01:47:25,180
JOE: For me and they.

1792
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:26,319
TRAVIS: 18, 17?

1793
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,218
MATT: 18, 17?

1794
01:47:30,218 --> 01:47:32,198
JOE: Yes, yep.

1795
01:47:32,198 --> 01:47:34,186
MARISHA: Do you always do this or is this new for
you?

1796
01:47:34,186 --> 01:47:35,251
TRAVIS: I always do this.

1797
01:47:35,251 --> 01:47:37,467
ASHLEY: 15 for Pike.

1798
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:38,493
MATT: Nice.

1799
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:40,736
JOE: Is there a cricket in the studio or is that
part of the sound effect?

1800
01:47:40,736 --> 01:47:42,004
MATT: No, that's in the studio.

1801
01:47:42,004 --> 01:47:43,819
TRAVIS: It's just not that intense of a fight.

1802
01:47:43,819 --> 01:47:45,337
MATT: 15 to ten.

1803
01:47:45,337 --> 01:47:46,756
SAM: Ten.

1804
01:47:46,756 --> 01:47:49,113
MARISHA: Yeah, you hear it?

1805
01:47:49,113 --> 01:47:50,314
TRAVIS: Vax, what were you again?

1806
01:47:50,314 --> 01:47:51,355
LAURA: 24.

1807
01:47:51,355 --> 01:47:52,231
MATT: All right.

1808
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:53,253
TRAVIS: Vax.

1809
01:47:53,253 --> 01:47:55,547
LAURA: You were looking me in the eye when you
said it.

1810
01:47:55,547 --> 01:47:57,745
TALIESIN: Cricket's initiative is sadly 30.

1811
01:47:57,745 --> 01:48:01,241
MATT: Keyleth, what did you get?

1812
01:48:01,241 --> 01:48:02,272
MARISHA: Six.

1813
01:48:02,272 --> 01:48:03,751
SAM: So did Scanlan Two.

1814
01:48:03,751 --> 01:48:07,276
LIAM: Hateful eight.

1815
01:48:07,276 --> 01:48:08,783
JOE: So you roll separate initiatives for you and
Scanlan 2?

1816
01:48:08,783 --> 01:48:10,163
SAM: No, this is new for me. This is new.

1817
01:48:10,163 --> 01:48:14,378
MATT: So is that everybody? I believe that's
everybody.

1818
01:48:14,378 --> 01:48:20,157
SAM: Matt, just manage the ten people and three
creatures on the field right now and you'll be fine.

1819
01:48:20,157 --> 01:48:23,029
MATT: I know. Be good. All right. First up first,
Grog, it's you.

1820
01:48:23,029 --> 01:48:26,853
TRAVIS: It's me. Already raging.

1821
01:48:26,853 --> 01:48:28,419
MATT: Yep, you're already raging.

1822
01:48:28,419 --> 01:48:34,656
TRAVIS: Let's see, there's a window, right? Can I
run upstairs?

1823
01:48:34,656 --> 01:48:42,127
MATT: You are now up with these assholes. Right
there.

1824
01:48:42,127 --> 01:48:44,905
TRAVIS: And I jump out the motherfucking window.

1825
01:48:44,905 --> 01:48:47,463
MATT: That you can. (heavy impact)

1826
01:48:47,463 --> 01:48:50,027
TRAVIS: Is that my full 50?

1827
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:55,264
MATT: I'd put that at about 35, I'd say. You've
got 15 feet still.

1828
01:48:55,264 --> 01:49:00,352
TRAVIS: Awesome. So I'm going to double dash with
the spider boots that Percy gave me and I'm going

1829
01:49:00,352 --> 01:49:04,644
to run up the tower and just go straight, yeah.

1830
01:49:04,644 --> 01:49:05,776
MATT: Well, one dash.

1831
01:49:05,776 --> 01:49:06,705
TRAVIS: One dash.

1832
01:49:06,705 --> 01:49:09,049
MATT: So you get to the top of the tower and you
are now base to base with the dragon.

1833
01:49:09,049 --> 01:49:14,925
LAURA: Did you just fucking go father than 60 feet
away from me?

1834
01:49:14,925 --> 01:49:17,788
TALIESIN: No. Technically radius-wise--

1835
01:49:17,788 --> 01:49:19,217
MATT: Radius-wise he's close to you still.

1836
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:20,710
TRAVIS: Yeah, why you making me feel dumb?

1837
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:26,888
LAURA: Just remember that because it's a thing
during battle. They could, but we don't know. We

1838
01:49:26,888 --> 01:49:28,278
could kill them before he knows.

1839
01:49:28,278 --> 01:49:32,394
JOE: So that means if I get up next to this thing,
I would be in range of this 60 feet?

1840
01:49:32,394 --> 01:49:34,495
LAURA: You are within 60 feet right now.

1841
01:49:34,495 --> 01:49:36,961
SAM: Just do what you do. It's Vex's job to keep
us in radius.

1842
01:49:36,961 --> 01:49:39,317
JOE: What bonus do I have?

1843
01:49:39,317 --> 01:49:42,731
LAURA: That doesn't give you a bonus, it just
keeps Vecna from seeing you.

1844
01:49:42,731 --> 01:49:47,765
TRAVIS: Am I within melee of that skeleton dragon?
The bone dragon?

1845
01:49:47,765 --> 01:49:49,099
MATT: You are within melee of the dragon.

1846
01:49:49,099 --> 01:49:50,491
TRAVIS: Perfect. That's my turn.

1847
01:49:50,491 --> 01:49:52,421
LAURA: The only way we're going to get the drop on
him is if he doesn't actually know we're here.

1848
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:53,930
SAM: He's going to know we're here. They're going
to tell him.

1849
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,171
LAURA: We're going to kill them.

1850
01:49:55,171 --> 01:49:58,491
TRAVIS: With my bonus action can I make it a
frenzied rage?

1851
01:49:58,491 --> 01:50:01,804
MATT: You may. That's your turn, Grog. Vax, you're
up.

1852
01:50:01,804 --> 01:50:04,573
LIAM: I got an eight. I'm way at the bottom.

1853
01:50:04,573 --> 01:50:06,832
LAURA: I had a 24.

1854
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:12,948
MATT: All right, so Vex?

1855
01:50:12,948 --> 01:50:14,992
LAURA: Can I lean out the window and attack?

1856
01:50:14,992 --> 01:50:15,984
MATT: You may.

1857
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:24,342
LAURA: Okay, I lean out the window, and can I see
Delilah? Can I shoot at her?

1858
01:50:24,342 --> 01:50:25,519
MATT: Sure.

1859
01:50:25,519 --> 01:50:31,312
LAURA: With my sharpshooter, she doesn't get any
additional cover or anything. Okay, so I'm going

1860
01:50:31,312 --> 01:50:39,377
to sharpshooter Delilah with one of my needle
arrows that I've been hanging onto for a gajillion

1861
01:50:39,377 --> 01:50:45,377
years. So that is a 25 to hit.

1862
01:50:45,377 --> 01:50:50,602
MATT: 25 to hit? Yeah, even with Shield, she
couldn't stop that. That hits.

1863
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:55,524
LAURA: Yes! Okay. Good.

1864
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:57,662
SAM: Is she aiming for the dragon?

1865
01:50:57,662 --> 01:50:58,824
TALIESIN: No, Delilah.

1866
01:50:58,824 --> 01:51:00,582
SAM: Big D.

1867
01:51:00,582 --> 01:51:06,758
LAURA: Is that sneak attack because she didn't
know I was there, technically? Oh, Grog's standing

1868
01:51:06,758 --> 01:51:07,661
right there!

1869
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:14,388
MATT: Grog's in melee with the dragon. I'll say
because she was not aware of you, they were only

1870
01:51:14,388 --> 01:51:18,954
aware of him, it's sneak attack. It's not a crit;
it's not a surprise attack, but you get sneak

1871
01:51:18,954 --> 01:51:20,033
attack.

1872
01:51:20,033 --> 01:51:24,549
LAURA: (counting) 31.

1873
01:51:24,549 --> 01:51:26,700
MATT: 31. All right, 31 points of damage.

1874
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:30,157
LAURA: Oh, no, 41 because I was sharpshootering.

1875
01:51:30,157 --> 01:51:31,607
MATT: Okay.

1876
01:51:31,607 --> 01:51:35,595
LAURA: And then that one definitely doesn't hit.

1877
01:51:35,595 --> 01:51:37,957
ASHLEY: But it wasn't in the thing.

1878
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:39,738
LAURA: I know, but it still was a roll.

1879
01:51:39,738 --> 01:51:41,164
MATT: What is it?

1880
01:51:41,164 --> 01:51:42,231
LAURA: It's 17.

1881
01:51:42,231 --> 01:51:47,818
MATT: 17? Nope, that misses. As you lean through
the window, you release the first arrow, and as

1882
01:51:47,818 --> 01:51:54,145
Delilah's up there, both clutching the necklace
and has her hand out with this wand, you hit her

1883
01:51:54,145 --> 01:51:59,312
hand with the arrow. (snarls) Looks over and looks
down at the window, right towards you, and there's

1884
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:04,790
a moment of recognition as she sees you. As you
fire the second arrow, she dodges it and goes,

1885
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:07,359
"I remember you."

1886
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:11,903
LAURA: (scared noises) I'm going to use my bonus
action to hide.

1887
01:52:11,903 --> 01:52:15,288
MATT: Okay, so you duck off to the side of the
window.

1888
01:52:15,288 --> 01:52:21,963
LAURA: Not that it matters, but I'm going to roll
for stealth. That did nothing. 21? Nope, 31,

1889
01:52:21,963 --> 01:52:23,409
because I still haven't cast Hunter's Mark.

1890
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:28,777
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that ends
your turn. With that, it is now Delilah's turn.

1891
01:52:28,777 --> 01:52:32,303
She rolled a 19 for initiative.

1892
01:52:32,303 --> 01:52:37,030
LAURA: Okay, so it's Grog, Vex, Delilah.

1893
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:41,453
TRAVIS: I don't know where Vax is. I forgot his
number.

1894
01:52:41,453 --> 01:52:43,990
LAURA: He's eight. Percy what?

1895
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:45,870
TRAVIS: Percy, Arkhan, Pike.

1896
01:52:45,870 --> 01:52:49,049
JOE: It's <i>Arkhan</i>.

1897
01:52:49,049 --> 01:52:52,852
TRAVIS: I get all names wrong.

1898
01:52:52,852 --> 01:53:03,758
MATT: All right, she is going to point her finger
down at the wall where all of you guys are, and a

1899
01:53:03,758 --> 01:53:06,855
thin green ray streaks out from her finger.

1900
01:53:06,855 --> 01:53:08,720
LAURA: She's disintegrating the wall?

1901
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,183
MATT: Seems to be.

1902
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:12,852
JOE: I don't like the phone.

1903
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:17,531
TRAVIS: I know. When there are too many dice to
roll, the phone comes out.

1904
01:53:17,531 --> 01:53:18,849
LAURA: Oh no.

1905
01:53:18,849 --> 01:53:20,293
MATT: I'm just confirming.

1906
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:26,714
TRAVIS: The deliverance of the death? The method
chosen?

1907
01:53:26,714 --> 01:53:32,326
MATT: The size of the space that it can
disintegrate. There we go.

1908
01:53:32,326 --> 01:53:34,968
TRAVIS: We've got a dragonborn paladin. We're
fine.

1909
01:53:34,968 --> 01:53:41,153
LIAM: Could you ring up Tiamat and have her help
with this dragon thing?

1910
01:53:41,153 --> 01:53:48,674
MATT: This entire wall right here.

1911
01:53:48,674 --> 01:53:54,057
LAURA: That's true; you could turn the whole
thing.

1912
01:53:54,057 --> 01:54:01,180
MATT: This entire wall is disintegrated in place
and now reveals entirely Vex and Vax.

1913
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,663
LAURA: I'm like--

1914
01:54:02,663 --> 01:54:10,071
MATT: As she pulls her finger back and the wall
turns to dust around you, you hear her say, "I'm

1915
01:54:10,071 --> 01:54:11,893
"sorry, honey, but no."

1916
01:54:11,893 --> 01:54:15,278
LAURA: Oh, hello there. I didn't see you.

1917
01:54:15,278 --> 01:54:17,471
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh, hello!

1918
01:54:17,471 --> 01:54:25,228
MATT: It is now the dragon's turn. Let's see if it
gets its breath attack. It does regenerate. The

1919
01:54:25,228 --> 01:54:29,500
dragon (wingbeats). You get an attack of
opportunity.

1920
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:32,236
TRAVIS: I'll make it reckless.

1921
01:54:32,236 --> 01:54:38,736
MATT: I should have put tape on the bottom of
them. That's my fault.

1922
01:54:38,736 --> 01:54:40,319
SAM: We have tape. We could get tape.

1923
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:43,284
MARISHA: Is there gaff tape in the house?

1924
01:54:43,284 --> 01:54:46,099
LAURA: Man, I really wish we had some tape right
now!

1925
01:54:46,099 --> 01:54:48,501
MARISHA: I know there's a row of it back there.

1926
01:54:48,501 --> 01:54:51,125
JOE: Dear Tiamat: Send tape.

1927
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:53,216
LAURA: Did you get the attack?

1928
01:54:53,216 --> 01:54:58,853
JOE: Dear Tiamat: It's Arkhan. We need Scotch
tape.

1929
01:54:58,853 --> 01:55:01,242
TRAVIS: I believe it's <i>Arkhan.</i>

1930
01:55:01,242 --> 01:55:05,076
MATT: As the dragon (wingbeats), you get an attack
of opportunity on the dragon.

1931
01:55:05,076 --> 01:55:06,353
TRAVIS: It's a 34.

1932
01:55:06,353 --> 01:55:07,501
MATT: 34? That hits!

1933
01:55:07,501 --> 01:55:09,435
MARISHA: Yeah, get that roll of gaffer tape.

1934
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:10,908
MATT: Thank you kindly, Mr. Brian Foster.

1935
01:55:10,908 --> 01:55:13,315
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Brian Foster.

1936
01:55:13,315 --> 01:55:15,978
BRIAN: It's a janitor's keyring of tape.

1937
01:55:15,978 --> 01:55:19,923
LAURA: Use the gaff tape. It's the best.

1938
01:55:19,923 --> 01:55:22,350
JOE: This thing is on the ground now?

1939
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:27,596
MATT: It is hovering right above the ground. It's
trying to get down into the space of the wall

1940
01:55:27,596 --> 01:55:34,405
that's currently exposed. Please pass the tape
over here? Okay. How much damage is that, Grog?

1941
01:55:34,405 --> 01:55:37,144
TRAVIS: This dragon would be considered undead,
yes?

1942
01:55:37,144 --> 01:55:38,125
MATT: Yes.

1943
01:55:38,125 --> 01:55:43,463
TRAVIS: So with the sword's 2d10 slashing damage
to undead, that's 32 points of damage.

1944
01:55:43,463 --> 01:55:49,885
MATT: 32 points of damage to the dragon. Nice. So
as it swoops up, the dragon takes one arc with the

1945
01:55:49,885 --> 01:55:53,185
blade, and as it streaks across, it slams into
part of its foot, and you watch as the bone

1946
01:55:53,185 --> 01:55:59,806
splinters upon impact with the Sword of Kas. As
the dragon lands, it brings its head down into the

1947
01:55:59,806 --> 01:56:07,198
gap where the opening is and arches forward. As it
does, it fills the entirety of the space. It

1948
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:12,583
inhales a second time. You watch as all the bits
of bone spiral up into it. It regenerated for the

1949
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:14,121
second time.

1950
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:17,834
SAM: Is this an attack roll that it's about to
make?

1951
01:56:17,834 --> 01:56:24,743
MATT: No, it's a saving throw on you guys' part.
As it releases this torrent of bone shards and

1952
01:56:24,743 --> 01:56:29,177
rock and whatever it can pull up into its chest
and releases it, I need everybody in that room:

1953
01:56:29,177 --> 01:56:32,609
both Scanlans, Keyleth, Percival--

1954
01:56:32,609 --> 01:56:34,002
TALIESIN: Do I not have cover?

1955
01:56:34,002 --> 01:56:37,206
MATT: Cover's not going to help you on this,
unfortunately. It fills the whole space.

1956
01:56:37,206 --> 01:56:39,418
JOE: Should've rode in on a horse.

1957
01:56:39,418 --> 01:56:41,464
MARISHA: What are we making? Dex saves?

1958
01:56:41,464 --> 01:56:43,153
MATT: Dexterity saving throws, guys.

1959
01:56:43,153 --> 01:56:46,029
MARISHA: This doesn't give us spell resist,
right?

1960
01:56:46,029 --> 01:56:50,081
SAM: Scanlan Two is going to use Cutting Words to
reduce the damage.

1961
01:56:50,081 --> 01:56:51,125
MATT: Okay.

1962
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:52,401
MARISHA: That's all right. That's good.

1963
01:56:52,401 --> 01:56:56,822
SAM: Dex?

1964
01:56:56,822 --> 01:57:04,045
MATT: All right.

1965
01:57:04,045 --> 01:57:07,213
SAM: Scanlan One: 18. Scanlan Two: 25.

1966
01:57:07,213 --> 01:57:08,755
MATT: Both succeed. 18, barely.

1967
01:57:08,755 --> 01:57:09,600
TALIESIN: 18.

1968
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,497
MATT: Succeeds.

1969
01:57:10,497 --> 01:57:11,258
MARISHA: 17.

1970
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:12,274
MATT: Barely missed it.

1971
01:57:12,274 --> 01:57:15,137
LIAM: 26. Evasion means zero.

1972
01:57:15,137 --> 01:57:16,530
LAURA: 31.

1973
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:24,741
MATT: 31 succeeds. All righty. The only person to
take full damage on this is Keyleth, right? Sorry.

1974
01:57:24,741 --> 01:57:27,710
Double-checking on the bard ability Cutting
Words.

1975
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:33,225
SAM: Can reduce damage by d12.

1976
01:57:33,225 --> 01:57:34,824
MATT: Roll a d12.

1977
01:57:34,824 --> 01:57:36,405
LAURA: On all of us?

1978
01:57:36,405 --> 01:57:38,340
SAM: Five. Five less.

1979
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:39,523
LAURA: That's good.

1980
01:57:39,523 --> 01:57:44,512
MATT: That is 49 points of piercing damage to you,
Keyleth.

1981
01:57:44,512 --> 01:57:45,827
MARISHA: 49!

1982
01:57:45,827 --> 01:57:50,483
MATT: The rest of you take 24.

1983
01:57:50,483 --> 01:57:52,465
LAURA: That's minus the five?

1984
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:54,473
MATT: Yes.

1985
01:57:54,473 --> 01:57:59,730
MARISHA: Minus 49? I'm at 94.

1986
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:05,599
MATT: It fills the space there, and you feel every
ounce of exposed skin and flesh has been hit with

1987
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,330
a thousand needles. That ends its turn. Percival,
you're up.

1988
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:19,447
TALIESIN: So I can gather my wits, there's an
angry Delilah with a wand, clutching a weird thing

1989
01:58:19,447 --> 01:58:24,653
around her neck. There's a Sylas with what I
assume would be a brand new sword.

1990
01:58:24,653 --> 01:58:25,988
MATT: Probably.

1991
01:58:25,988 --> 01:58:29,673
TALIESIN: And they're sitting about how many feet
up on a dragon right now?

1992
01:58:29,673 --> 01:58:32,176
MATT: I'd say about 15 feet.

1993
01:58:32,176 --> 01:58:35,892
TALIESIN: Let's have a little fun.

1994
01:58:35,892 --> 01:58:38,991
ASHLEY: Let's have a little fun.

1995
01:58:38,991 --> 01:58:46,098
TALIESIN: All right. Oh, good, and I have an
escape route. That'll do really nicely. This is

1996
01:58:46,098 --> 01:58:50,591
going to be fun. I'm going to Bugs Bunny this
lady. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

1997
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:52,088
take a shot--

1998
01:58:52,088 --> 01:58:53,509
MARISHA: Don't look down.

1999
01:58:53,509 --> 01:58:55,235
TALIESIN: Why?

2000
01:58:55,235 --> 01:58:56,556
MARISHA: Never mind.

2001
01:58:56,556 --> 01:59:02,359
TALIESIN: Oh, no. That was good. It took me a
second. I'm going to take a shot with Animus. Boy,

2002
01:59:02,359 --> 01:59:06,052
I'm nervous. I'm going to burn a point of grit,
and I'm going to make her drop her wand.

2003
01:59:06,052 --> 01:59:08,015
TRAVIS: You've got this. Focus in. You got it.

2004
01:59:08,015 --> 01:59:09,438
MATT: Roll for the attack.

2005
01:59:09,438 --> 01:59:11,987
TRAVIS: Walk in the park.

2006
01:59:11,987 --> 01:59:15,272
TALIESIN: That's a 31 to hit.

2007
01:59:15,272 --> 01:59:16,525
MATT: That'll hit.

2008
01:59:16,525 --> 01:59:20,903
TALIESIN: Let's make her drop stuff. It's a
strength saving throw.

2009
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:29,064
MATT: Natural five. So as she's holding the wand
out with the hand, (gunshot, grunts). She glances

2010
01:59:29,064 --> 01:59:35,549
back, and as the smoking gun is there, she goes,
"I certainly remember you."

2011
01:59:35,549 --> 01:59:39,717
TALIESIN: I missed you, too, darling. I still do
damage on that one, I believe.

2012
01:59:39,717 --> 01:59:46,077
MATT: Her hand is now covered in blood, and you
can see one of the fingers looks heavily damaged.

2013
01:59:46,077 --> 01:59:55,265
LIAM: Grog does not count in melee of the
dracolich, right? It's just toys.

2014
01:59:55,265 --> 01:59:56,591
MATT: Grog is not in melee.

2015
01:59:56,591 --> 01:59:59,060
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage, plus five
points of psychic, so 14.

2016
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,580
MATT: Okay. 14 points. Got it.

2017
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:13,927
TALIESIN: For my next trick, I'm going to burn
another point of grit. Let's push Sylas ten feet.

2018
02:00:13,927 --> 02:00:23,189
Another 31 to hit.

2019
02:00:23,189 --> 02:00:24,337
MATT: That hits.

2020
02:00:24,337 --> 02:00:30,699
TALIESIN: So let's take a little damage and do
a little psychic. I do not like this die, I'm

2021
02:00:30,759 --> 02:00:35,886
getting rid of it. It's only nine points of damage
plus two points of psychic.

2022
02:00:35,886 --> 02:00:37,560
MATT: So 11 to Sylas.

2023
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:42,240
TALIESIN: So now Sylas has to move ten feet back.

2024
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,777
MATT: No save right?

2025
02:00:43,777 --> 02:00:44,847
TALIESIN: No save.

2026
02:00:44,847 --> 02:00:47,357
MATT: He gets blasted off the back of the dragon.

2027
02:00:47,357 --> 02:00:49,072
ALL: Yes!

2028
02:00:49,072 --> 02:00:50,484
TALIESIN: (Woody Woodpecker laugh)

2029
02:00:50,484 --> 02:00:53,408
TRAVIS: I thought it was Bugs Bunny, but you did
Woody Woodpecker.

2030
02:00:53,408 --> 02:00:56,801
TALIESIN: Woody Woodpecker certainly has more
shade.

2031
02:00:56,801 --> 02:01:01,327
JOE: Is this creature under control to the point
where someone takes damage and has to make a

2032
02:01:01,327 --> 02:01:02,844
control save?

2033
02:01:02,844 --> 02:01:04,121
TALIESIN: We don't know.

2034
02:01:04,121 --> 02:01:05,545
MARISHA: I mean if it used to be yours--

2035
02:01:05,545 --> 02:01:06,885
JOE: It was mine.

2036
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:07,988
MARISHA: I don't know.

2037
02:01:07,988 --> 02:01:10,272
JOE: But it's not anymore.

2038
02:01:10,272 --> 02:01:11,677
LAURA: Now it's dead.

2039
02:01:11,677 --> 02:01:13,906
ASHLEY: Maybe you can try to get through to it.

2040
02:01:13,906 --> 02:01:18,485
MATT: So he gets blown off and lands prone on the
ground.

2041
02:01:18,485 --> 02:01:33,678
TALIESIN: For my next one, let's push Delilah ten
feet for my final trick. That's a 28 to hit.

2042
02:01:33,678 --> 02:01:35,503
MATT: Shit, that hits.

2043
02:01:35,503 --> 02:01:49,254
TALIESIN: Sorry, man. It's my best trick and I
burned a lot of it. 15 points of damage plus four

2044
02:01:49,254 --> 02:01:58,039
points of psychic plus ten feet. Take some fall
damage.

2045
02:01:58,039 --> 02:02:00,644
MATT: Put her behind the dragon. Actually both
should be behind the dragon.

2046
02:02:00,644 --> 02:02:03,907
LAURA: Did they take damage from falling?

2047
02:02:03,907 --> 02:02:12,141
MATT: They did. They both took 2d6 each, five
points of bludgeoning damage each.

2048
02:02:12,141 --> 02:02:23,689
TALIESIN: So for the rest of it I'm going to use a
bonus action to run a heal. I'm going to give

2049
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:41,404
myself 19 points back. I'm going to run
downstairs. I'm heading towards that back door.

2050
02:02:41,404 --> 02:02:47,119
MATT: That ends your turn, Percival. Arkhan,
you're up.

2051
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:49,099
JOE: I would like to rage.

2052
02:02:49,099 --> 02:02:51,658
TRAVIS: Did you rage?

2053
02:02:51,658 --> 02:02:53,042
JOE: Yes!

2054
02:02:53,042 --> 02:02:57,026
(cheering)

2055
02:02:57,026 --> 02:02:59,154
LIAM: Sorry audio team.

2056
02:02:59,154 --> 02:03:03,274
SAM: The testosterone in his group just went from
a half to one.

2057
02:03:03,274 --> 02:03:05,328
MATT: Did you say you went into a frenzied rage
earlier?

2058
02:03:05,328 --> 02:03:06,440
TRAVIS: I did.

2059
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,458
MATT: Okay.

2060
02:03:07,458 --> 02:03:15,536
JOE: Now, question. If I fly past the dragon to
Delilah do I give the dragon an attack of

2061
02:03:15,536 --> 02:03:16,715
opportunity?

2062
02:03:16,715 --> 02:03:18,468
MATT: Yes, you would.

2063
02:03:18,468 --> 02:03:26,208
JOE: I have to go through this thing. I'm going to
fly the gloomstalker right up to this thing.

2064
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:39,995
Gloomstalker pulls into range and it
makes two attacks on the undead Obakala.

2065
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:41,888
MATT: Go for it.

2066
02:03:41,888 --> 02:03:58,016
JOE: Oh, terrible. Actually terrible. That's
terrible. So that's going to be a 13 and natural one.

2067
02:03:58,016 --> 02:04:02,613
MATT: Both miss, unfortunately. Its claws streak
out in front of it and unfortunately scrape

2068
02:04:02,613 --> 02:04:05,685
against the bone to no effect. But you have your
turn.

2069
02:04:05,685 --> 02:04:07,127
JOE: Now it's me.

2070
02:04:07,127 --> 02:04:09,167
LAURA: That's an awesome-- Is that your Wyrmwood
box?

2071
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:15,817
JOE: This is mine, yes. They do those specials.
Those one of a kinds that you can buy.

2072
02:04:15,817 --> 02:04:17,246
LAURA: Oh, oh well.

2073
02:04:17,246 --> 02:04:20,605
(laughter)

2074
02:04:20,605 --> 02:04:22,169
TALIESIN: Next campaign.

2075
02:04:22,169 --> 02:04:23,934
ASHLEY: I have an idea.

2076
02:04:23,934 --> 02:04:31,861
JOE: So I get advantage on my attacks because
I'm raging. This is the first time I've ever raged.

2077
02:04:31,861 --> 02:04:34,221
MATT: If you're going reckless attacks you can.

2078
02:04:34,221 --> 02:04:35,830
JOE: Reckless frenzied rage.

2079
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:38,049
MATT: Then yes you can.

2080
02:04:38,049 --> 02:04:39,466
JOE: Yes. Okay, great.

2081
02:04:39,466 --> 02:04:43,257
MATT: You're going frenzied rage as opposed to
regular rage?

2082
02:04:43,257 --> 02:04:44,921
JOE: Frenzied does-- Yes.

2083
02:04:44,921 --> 02:04:46,237
TRAVIS: You have to hold it.

2084
02:04:46,237 --> 02:04:48,321
JOE: Hold? Oh because I'm not.

2085
02:04:48,321 --> 02:04:51,407
MATT: He used his bonus action to rage.

2086
02:04:51,407 --> 02:04:54,758
JOE: I used the bonus to rage in the first place.

2087
02:04:54,758 --> 02:04:55,763
MATT: Right.

2088
02:04:55,763 --> 02:05:02,934
JOE: Great! That first one is going to be a 33 to
hit.

2089
02:05:02,934 --> 02:05:04,215
MATT: That hits.

2090
02:05:04,215 --> 02:05:05,607
ASHLEY: Yes!

2091
02:05:05,607 --> 02:05:07,540
JOE: And this thing is undead?

2092
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:08,388
MATT: Correct.

2093
02:05:08,388 --> 02:05:10,185
LAURA: Yas, Queen Tiamat!

2094
02:05:10,185 --> 02:05:19,863
JOE: I'm going to pump a 3rd-level Divine Smite
into it. Which is-- bear with me, now.

2095
02:05:19,863 --> 02:05:22,893
TRAVIS: We don't do math fast ever.

2096
02:05:22,893 --> 02:05:32,957
JOE: 2d8 for the axe. 2d8 for 1st-level
Divine Smite. Three more for--

2097
02:05:32,957 --> 02:05:36,401
MATT: 2nd, 3rd-level and undead. Correct.

2098
02:05:36,401 --> 02:05:38,408
ASHLEY: All of it!

2099
02:05:38,408 --> 02:05:39,542
TRAVIS: Dump it, dude.

2100
02:05:39,542 --> 02:05:40,752
LIAM: Unload.

2101
02:05:40,752 --> 02:05:42,402
JOE: So that's seven.

2102
02:05:42,402 --> 02:05:58,328
SAM: Math!

2103
02:05:58,328 --> 02:06:02,409
(laughter)

2104
02:06:02,409 --> 02:06:09,874
JOE: It's going to be 49.

2105
02:06:09,874 --> 02:06:16,087
MATT: 49 points of damage on the first hit. So as
you rush up and the Gloomstalker is scratching

2106
02:06:16,087 --> 02:06:22,583
towards it, you rush with a giant arc. You watch
as Fane-Eater's blade springs forth these darkened

2107
02:06:22,583 --> 02:06:27,562
spray of colors, red, green, black. Every
chromatic dragon's power thrust into the blade as

2108
02:06:27,562 --> 02:06:34,078
you slam it into the undead dragon. Watching bones
splinter and break from the blast of dark energy.

2109
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:35,963
JOE: Love it. Second attack.

2110
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:37,456
MATT: Go for it.

2111
02:06:37,456 --> 02:06:45,644
JOE: That's a good one too. That's going to be 29.
Same thing, 3rd-level Divine Smite, 7d8.

2112
02:06:45,644 --> 02:06:57,355
(counting) 47.

2113
02:06:57,355 --> 02:07:00,539
LAURA: Kill that dragon.

2114
02:07:00,539 --> 02:07:09,085
MATT: As you pull the axe back you arc a secondary
time. This time with the sound of a union of four

2115
02:07:09,085 --> 02:07:14,845
different dragon cries, the fifth one being your
own. As you slam the axe a second time, hitting

2116
02:07:14,845 --> 02:07:19,865
the edge of its clavicle, it carves through and
breaks. You can see part of the bones shatter and

2117
02:07:19,865 --> 02:07:25,602
reform but still broken and not in the same way.
It's a serious round.

2118
02:07:25,602 --> 02:07:32,027
JOE: Just a hint, a tiny hint, of remorse for
having to kill this thing that I helped raise.

2119
02:07:32,027 --> 02:07:33,831
ALL: Aw.

2120
02:07:33,831 --> 02:07:35,998
LAURA: That'd be like if I had to fight undead
Trinket.

2121
02:07:35,998 --> 02:07:40,229
TRAVIS: Legendary action incoming.

2122
02:07:40,229 --> 02:07:44,628
MATT: Sylas Briarwood is going to move his speed.
Would you hand me Sylas, please?

2123
02:07:44,628 --> 02:07:46,640
TALIESIN: He's prone.

2124
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:51,996
MATT: He's prone, so has half it. He moves
through. He gets partway through the dragon,

2125
02:07:51,996 --> 02:07:57,192
we'll say. So he's about there. That ends your
turn?

2126
02:07:57,192 --> 02:07:59,068
MARISHA: Sylas is up and moving?

2127
02:07:59,068 --> 02:08:00,410
TALIESIN: Sylas is up and moving.

2128
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:01,784
MATT: End of your turn?

2129
02:08:01,784 --> 02:08:03,668
JOE: That's all I got.

2130
02:08:03,668 --> 02:08:10,711
MATT: All right. Sylas' turn. Sylas, seeing you
come up and destroy the dragon, grins, climbs up

2131
02:08:10,711 --> 02:08:19,651
the side of the dragon, jumps onto its thigh and
jumps in the air towards you, holding a giant

2132
02:08:19,651 --> 02:08:31,745
blackened greataxe in his hand. (groans) He's
going to go ahead and make a strike at you. Oh, you

2133
02:08:31,745 --> 02:08:38,767
know what? No. He's not going to. Sylas instead,
axe in one hand, grabs the side of the skeletal

2134
02:08:38,767 --> 02:08:47,180
ribcage, hanging off, looks up at you. "You seem
rather strong." And looks you dead in the eyes. I

2135
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:48,587
need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

2136
02:08:48,587 --> 02:08:50,978
LAURA: No! Oh my god no! Do not get turned!

2137
02:08:50,978 --> 02:08:53,120
TRAVIS: Does he have advantage on wisdom
something?

2138
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,514
LAURA: No, he doesn't because he didn't have the
feast.

2139
02:08:55,514 --> 02:08:56,910
SAM: Can I Cutting Words?

2140
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,561
MATT: You already used your reaction, buddy.

2141
02:08:58,561 --> 02:08:59,813
SAM: One of us has.

2142
02:08:59,813 --> 02:09:01,091
MATT: It's true.

2143
02:09:01,091 --> 02:09:05,893
SAM: Scanlan Prime steps up.

2144
02:09:05,893 --> 02:09:09,937
MATT: Cutting Words only-- You can't give a bonus
to somebody's saving throw.

2145
02:09:09,937 --> 02:09:11,543
SAM: Okay, then never mind.

2146
02:09:11,543 --> 02:09:13,766
MATT: You can reduce an enemy's saving throw.

2147
02:09:13,766 --> 02:09:15,049
SAM: Got it.

2148
02:09:15,049 --> 02:09:17,024
MATT: Through Mythcarver.

2149
02:09:17,024 --> 02:09:23,957
JOE: Straight up roll. Here we go. Natural 20!

2150
02:09:23,957 --> 02:09:25,840
(screaming)

2151
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:31,818
MATT: Oh shit.

2152
02:09:31,818 --> 02:09:33,805
TRAVIS: In the clutch.

2153
02:09:33,805 --> 02:09:41,821
JOE: I stare him right in the eyes. What would
have happened?

2154
02:09:41,821 --> 02:09:46,547
MATT: He would've charmed you and you would've had
to start fighting them.

2155
02:09:46,547 --> 02:09:48,035
TRAVIS and MARISHA: No!

2156
02:09:48,035 --> 02:09:56,574
MATT: As he stares at you, you feel this cold
presence consume the back of your mind. And you

2157
02:09:56,574 --> 02:10:02,427
feel drawn to him. It's this force of charisma and
drive, and as you begin to lean forward towards it

2158
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:07,019
you feel this (thump) in your holy symbol and as
you glance you break the gaze for a second and

2159
02:10:07,019 --> 02:10:11,865
look down. And you see the multi-colored fury of
Tiamat reach up and block and obscure the vision

2160
02:10:11,865 --> 02:10:15,480
from him. And as the flames burn off you look up
and the presence is gone. And he looks at you with

2161
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,880
a frustrated glance.

2162
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:23,537
JOE: Yes! Rage!

2163
02:10:23,537 --> 02:10:35,570
MATT: He's going to use the rest of his movement
to dart back around the side of the tower.

2164
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:38,261
TALIESIN: How much movement does he have left?

2165
02:10:38,261 --> 02:10:43,299
MATT: He used a legendary action to get up and get
his movement, then on his turn he got his

2166
02:10:43,299 --> 02:10:44,284
movement.

2167
02:10:44,284 --> 02:10:48,100
TALIESIN: All right. No, that's a good 
use of a legendary action.

2168
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:50,048
MATT: That brings us to Pike.

2169
02:10:50,048 --> 02:10:58,354
ASHLEY: Can I get upstairs? Stay hidden somewhere's
enough?

2170
02:10:58,354 --> 02:11:01,774
MATT: Sure. You get to about where the twins are.

2171
02:11:01,774 --> 02:11:19,351
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. Choose
everyone that I see.

2172
02:11:19,351 --> 02:11:23,258
MATT: Everyone within 30 feet that you can see gets
affected. That you can see, does it say?

2173
02:11:23,323 --> 02:11:27,063
ASHLEY: Choose any number of creatures within
range.

2174
02:11:27,063 --> 02:11:28,476
MATT: Which is 30 feet?

2175
02:11:28,476 --> 02:11:29,500
ASHLEY: Yes.

2176
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,959
MATT: You'd be able to see Percival down there.

2177
02:11:30,959 --> 02:11:32,228
ASHLEY: I can see Grog.

2178
02:11:32,228 --> 02:11:34,391
MATT: Grog is farther than 30 feet.

2179
02:11:34,391 --> 02:11:37,046
LAURA: Can you see Arkhan?

2180
02:11:37,046 --> 02:11:37,816
MATT: Yeah.

2181
02:11:37,816 --> 02:11:39,017
LAURA: Okay, good.

2182
02:11:39,017 --> 02:11:42,890
MATT: Arkhan's in direct vision.

2183
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:44,475
LAURA: What does this do, again?

2184
02:11:44,475 --> 02:11:52,539
ASHLEY: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws
and death saving throws. I'm also, as a bonus

2185
02:11:52,539 --> 02:11:56,160
action, going to cast Sanctuary on Vex.

2186
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:00,486
MATT: Sanctuary is a bonus action?

2187
02:12:00,486 --> 02:12:01,899
ASHLEY: It's a bonus action.

2188
02:12:01,899 --> 02:12:08,331
LAURA: What does that do? Okay, okay.

2189
02:12:08,331 --> 02:12:12,646
MATT: Sanctuary means that if something tries to
attack you it has to make a wisdom saving throw to

2190
02:12:12,646 --> 02:12:13,819
see if it does so or not.

2191
02:12:13,819 --> 02:12:15,665
TRAVIS: It's what Earthbreaker did.

2192
02:12:15,665 --> 02:12:19,533
MATT: End your turn, Pike?

2193
02:12:19,533 --> 02:12:33,291
ASHLEY: Am I able to get hidden around the wall?

2194
02:12:33,291 --> 02:12:39,659
MATT: Your movement would've gotten you just up to the
stairs at that point because you had to climb up

2195
02:12:39,659 --> 02:12:54,282
it. At the end of that turn, swooping down, you
hear two impacts on the roof above you. You hear

2196
02:12:54,282 --> 02:13:02,319
the growling, tearing sound as the long dry rotten
wooden rooftops that are above you guy get pulled

2197
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:06,666
open by two gloomstalkers that've joined the fray.

2198
02:13:06,666 --> 02:13:08,147
TRAVIS: Toothless?

2199
02:13:08,147 --> 02:13:10,871
TALIESIN: Do they count as undead?

2200
02:13:10,871 --> 02:13:13,603
MATT: They do not count as undead.

2201
02:13:13,603 --> 02:13:15,300
ASHLEY: Is the roof off of it?

2202
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:21,130
MATT: Now the roof is open. Its damaged bits and
parts of it are fallen inward. You guys can move

2203
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:24,596
around but they have visual on you, but that's all
they can do this turn. It took their full movement

2204
02:13:24,596 --> 02:13:29,220
and action to break in. That's going to end their
turn. Scanlan, you're up. Scanlan One.

2205
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:33,836
SAM: Scanlan One turns to Scanlan Two and sings a
Song of Healing.

2206
02:13:33,836 --> 02:13:36,867
MATT: Scanlan Two as in the--

2207
02:13:36,867 --> 02:13:39,969
TRAVIS: Which one are you? Prime or Two?

2208
02:13:39,969 --> 02:13:43,813
SAM: I'm Prime right now.

2209
02:13:43,813 --> 02:13:46,278
MATT: A simulacrum can not be healed, except by--

2210
02:13:46,278 --> 02:13:47,270
SAM: <i>Ever?</i>

2211
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:48,467
MATT: They can be repaired.

2212
02:13:48,467 --> 02:13:53,000
SAM: But not healed with a healing thing.

2213
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,089
MATT: Correct.

2214
02:13:54,089 --> 02:13:54,978
SAM: Or a potion.

2215
02:13:54,978 --> 02:13:55,849
MATT: Correct.

2216
02:13:55,849 --> 02:13:58,841
LAURA: How do they get repaired? Is it like a Doty
situation?

2217
02:13:58,841 --> 02:14:00,014
MATT: Kind of.

2218
02:14:00,014 --> 02:14:01,451
ASHLEY: Once they're gone they're gone?

2219
02:14:01,451 --> 02:14:02,224
MATT: Yep.

2220
02:14:02,224 --> 02:14:04,877
SAM: Then never mind that.

2221
02:14:04,877 --> 02:14:12,099
MATT: You would know this, having known the spell
and the significance of its creation. If it is

2222
02:14:12,099 --> 02:14:16,529
damaged you can repair it in an alchemical
laboratory using rare herbs and minerals worth a

2223
02:14:16,529 --> 02:14:17,903
hundred gold per hit point.

2224
02:14:17,903 --> 02:14:19,207
SAM: Oh boy.

2225
02:14:19,207 --> 02:14:22,860
TALIESIN: Can Scanlan Two heal himself?

2226
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:25,895
MATT: No, he can heal other things.

2227
02:14:25,895 --> 02:14:28,759
LAURA: How damaged is Scanlan Two already?

2228
02:14:28,759 --> 02:14:29,877
SAM: A little.

2229
02:14:29,877 --> 02:14:33,757
ASHLEY: Wait, from what?

2230
02:14:33,757 --> 02:14:35,917
MATT: The skeleton dragon breath.

2231
02:14:35,917 --> 02:14:51,384
SAM: All right. It's all good, guys. We're going to
be fine! Then Scanlan One will heal himself with a

2232
02:14:51,384 --> 02:14:53,455
bonus action Healing Word.

2233
02:14:53,455 --> 02:14:54,668
MATT: Okay.

2234
02:14:54,668 --> 02:15:01,046
SAM: And then he'll grab Scanlan Two and Dimension
Door behind the dragon.

2235
02:15:01,046 --> 02:15:02,455
MATT: Oh shit.

2236
02:15:02,455 --> 02:15:05,152
LAURA: What are you doing?

2237
02:15:05,152 --> 02:15:09,425
MATT: Both of these guys appear behind the dragon.
Right behind it?

2238
02:15:09,425 --> 02:15:10,679
SAM: On the ground.

2239
02:15:10,679 --> 02:15:12,393
LAURA: Do you know Sylas and Delilah are right
there?

2240
02:15:12,393 --> 02:15:13,627
LIAM: By Delilah or here?

2241
02:15:13,627 --> 02:15:14,993
SAM: Back there.

2242
02:15:14,993 --> 02:15:18,455
LAURA: Sylas is right here. Right next to Sylas?

2243
02:15:18,455 --> 02:15:19,459
SAM: Yeah.

2244
02:15:19,459 --> 02:15:22,918
LAURA: You want both of you to be right behind
Sylas?

2245
02:15:22,918 --> 02:15:28,153
MATT: I'm allowing you guys to move things. Thank
you.

2246
02:15:28,153 --> 02:15:30,964
LAURA: Do you want melee range, or do you want
back ten feet?

2247
02:15:30,964 --> 02:15:34,270
SAM: Back ten feet. That would be great.

2248
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:35,902
MATT: All right, so that's your action and bonus
action.

2249
02:15:35,902 --> 02:15:38,742
TALIESIN: You can move.

2250
02:15:38,742 --> 02:15:42,218
SAM: Wait, this was Scanlan One.

2251
02:15:42,218 --> 02:15:45,174
MATT: Scanlan Two hasn't gone yet. Scanlan Two is
at the very end, with Keyleth.

2252
02:15:45,174 --> 02:15:50,036
SAM: Scanlan One will walk around the side of the
thing.

2253
02:15:50,036 --> 02:15:52,718
MATT: There you go. All right. Vax, you're up.

2254
02:15:52,718 --> 02:15:55,016
LIAM: I really am? Oh my. Okay.

2255
02:15:55,016 --> 02:16:05,306
MATT: Actually, at the end of the turn, Sylas is
going to use another legendary action. He got them

2256
02:16:05,306 --> 02:16:08,620
back, actually, because he used it before last
turn. So he uses his first legendary action to

2257
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:17,643
head up.

2258
02:16:17,643 --> 02:16:19,763
LAURA: He can climb up walls?

2259
02:16:19,763 --> 02:16:30,064
MATT: He runs up the side. (impacts) He glances
down, looking towards where you are. All right,

2260
02:16:30,064 --> 02:16:33,853
that's going to bring us to Vax's turn.

2261
02:16:33,853 --> 02:16:37,947
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so if I get to the very edge
there, am I in range of Delilah on the ground

2262
02:16:37,947 --> 02:16:42,593
with Sharpshooter? Cover doesn't do much, except
full cover.

2263
02:16:42,593 --> 02:16:45,636
MATT: Yeah, she would have cover in this
circumstance, but you avoid it with Sharpshooter,

2264
02:16:45,636 --> 02:16:46,655
so you can.

2265
02:16:46,655 --> 02:16:48,805
LIAM: And am I within 60 feet over there, about?

2266
02:16:48,805 --> 02:16:49,826
MATT: Yes.

2267
02:16:49,826 --> 02:16:56,982
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to throw Whisper at her, and
she's down, so I have advantage. That is a 27 to hit.

2268
02:16:57,048 --> 02:16:59,014
MATT: 27 to hit hits.

2269
02:16:59,014 --> 02:17:00,587
LIAM: And I'm going to bamf there.

2270
02:17:00,587 --> 02:17:09,837
MATT: She's prone, so yeah. You have disadvantage
on the attack against her.

2271
02:17:09,837 --> 02:17:12,114
LIAM: What, because she's prone?

2272
02:17:12,114 --> 02:17:18,721
MATT: It's a ranged attack. You don't have
advantage against her because there's nothing

2273
02:17:18,721 --> 02:17:20,029
giving you advantage.

2274
02:17:20,029 --> 02:17:21,562
LIAM: Her being prone doesn't give me advantage?

2275
02:17:21,562 --> 02:17:25,598
MATT: No, her being prone, against ranged attacks,
it's with disadvantage. Roll a second time.

2276
02:17:25,598 --> 02:17:27,346
LIAM: That's much worse.

2277
02:17:27,346 --> 02:17:30,969
MARISHA: But it cancels out.

2278
02:17:30,969 --> 02:17:32,912
LAURA: Because of Sharpshooter.

2279
02:17:32,912 --> 02:17:37,593
MATT: Sharpshooter means he ignores cover. Doesn't
give him advantage on the attack roll.

2280
02:17:37,593 --> 02:17:39,811
MARISHA: That sucks.

2281
02:17:39,811 --> 02:17:43,696
MATT: Hold on, what was that one?

2282
02:17:43,696 --> 02:17:44,794
LIAM: 18.

2283
02:17:44,794 --> 02:17:51,205
MATT: 18 technically would hit. She's going to use
Shield as a reaction to add plus five to her AC.

2284
02:17:51,205 --> 02:17:54,771
She's on her back and sees the dagger and goes
(ping) and deflects it off.

2285
02:17:54,771 --> 02:18:01,529
LIAM: All right, second
attack is a natural 20.

2286
02:18:01,529 --> 02:18:02,929
TRAVIS: Really?

2287
02:18:02,929 --> 02:18:09,184
LIAM: Yeah. With Whisper, she has to make a saving
throw with a DC of 18 or become frightened of me

2288
02:18:09,184 --> 02:18:10,873
for a minute, on a crit.

2289
02:18:10,873 --> 02:18:16,820
MATT: What was the DC on that one?

2290
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:17,885
LIAM: 18.

2291
02:18:17,885 --> 02:18:20,950
MATT: 18? She has a plus ten wisdom save, so
that's going to put her at a 20.

2292
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:31,390
LIAM: All right. (counting)

2293
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:33,784
LAURA: That's a great way to roll.

2294
02:18:33,784 --> 02:18:42,156
LIAM: 72.

2295
02:18:42,156 --> 02:18:44,147
MATT: 72?

2296
02:18:44,147 --> 02:18:48,002
LIAM: Yeah, it's a crit. Double the dice.

2297
02:18:48,002 --> 02:18:51,137
MATT: Right, but it's not sneak attack, though.

2298
02:18:51,137 --> 02:18:55,490
LIAM: Oh, sorry, so. 32. Thank you.

2299
02:18:55,490 --> 02:18:57,093
MATT: No worries.

2300
02:18:57,093 --> 02:19:00,662
TRAVIS: Wow, your reverse math was super fast just
then. That would have taken me five minutes.

2301
02:19:00,662 --> 02:19:01,974
MATT: All right.

2302
02:19:01,974 --> 02:19:06,340
LIAM: And I'm going to bamf there on it.

2303
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:07,287
MATT: Okay.

2304
02:19:07,287 --> 02:19:13,795
LAURA: It's fine.

2305
02:19:13,795 --> 02:19:23,892
LIAM: Don't worry. And with my bonus action, I'm
going to throw my third dagger up at the wall. Can

2306
02:19:23,892 --> 02:19:28,890
I throw Whisper again? Is it like quick draw, or
does it have to change daggers?

2307
02:19:28,890 --> 02:19:35,100
MATT: Technically, I'd consider it to change
dagger, generally, because you're throwing them so fast.

2308
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:43,541
LIAM: All right, then instead I'm going to
disengage, and I'm going to dart back between the

2309
02:19:43,541 --> 02:19:44,892
Scanlans.

2310
02:19:44,892 --> 02:19:46,524
MARISHA: Between the Scanlans.

2311
02:19:46,524 --> 02:19:49,837
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vax?

2312
02:19:49,837 --> 02:19:51,985
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

2313
02:19:51,985 --> 02:19:57,325
MATT: At the end of your turn, Sylas is going to
use his second legendary action.

2314
02:19:57,325 --> 02:20:01,665
LIAM: Wait, she used a reaction to knock the
dagger away.

2315
02:20:01,665 --> 02:20:03,190
MATT: Sylas.

2316
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:11,225
LIAM: She used Shield, which is a reaction, so she
can't hit me with an attack of opportunity. Never mind.

2317
02:20:11,225 --> 02:20:13,516
MATT: That's not what this is. Sylas is using a
legendary action. This has nothing to do with

2318
02:20:13,516 --> 02:20:14,502
Delilah.

2319
02:20:14,502 --> 02:20:16,102
LAURA: You're talking about your disengage. Don't
worry about it.

2320
02:20:16,102 --> 02:20:20,950
MATT: Sylas is going to use his second legendary
action at the end of your turn to take a swing at

2321
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:23,389
Grog with his Greataxe of the Eclipse.

2322
02:20:23,389 --> 02:20:25,619
LAURA: Greataxe of the Eclipse?

2323
02:20:25,619 --> 02:20:26,776
MARISHA: Wait, Delilah or Sylas?

2324
02:20:26,776 --> 02:20:27,746
LAURA: Sylas.

2325
02:20:27,746 --> 02:20:28,964
MARISHA: Okay.

2326
02:20:28,964 --> 02:20:32,860
MATT: That is a 21.

2327
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:34,022
TRAVIS: That hits.

2328
02:20:34,022 --> 02:20:48,171
MATT: That is 14 points of damage, reduced to
seven, and I need you to make a wisdom saving

2329
02:20:48,171 --> 02:20:49,291
throw, please.

2330
02:20:49,291 --> 02:20:50,468
TALIESIN: With advantage.

2331
02:20:50,468 --> 02:21:00,727
TRAVIS: With advantage. Oh, wait. That's a d10.
Natural 20.

2332
02:21:00,727 --> 02:21:04,423
(relieved noises)

2333
02:21:04,423 --> 02:21:06,656
TRAVIS: First one was a three.

2334
02:21:06,656 --> 02:21:12,165
MATT: As the blade sinks across you, you resist
the impact, but you feel this cold sensation

2335
02:21:12,165 --> 02:21:17,458
across the wound that begins to spill across your
body. You angrily, in your rage, flex against it

2336
02:21:17,458 --> 02:21:24,545
and manage to withstand and shrug off the effect.
That ends that. Next up is Keyleth and Scanlan Two.

2337
02:21:24,545 --> 02:21:27,649
SAM: Hey.

2338
02:21:27,649 --> 02:21:31,621
MARISHA: Hey, Scanlan Two. Are you just as
charismatic as Scanlan One?

2339
02:21:31,621 --> 02:21:35,012
SAM: I've got all the words to make the girls like
me.

2340
02:21:35,012 --> 02:21:42,354
MARISHA: Okay, I don't care. Okay, Keyleth is
going to try to do a one-two punch here. She's

2341
02:21:42,354 --> 02:21:49,689
going to move forward and then does she see
Delilah?

2342
02:21:49,689 --> 02:21:55,692
MATT: Make a perception check. I'd say probably,
actually. You watched her get knocked back; you're fine.

2343
02:21:55,692 --> 02:22:02,842
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to reach out and do an
Entangle spell right under her.

2344
02:22:02,842 --> 02:22:05,081
MATT: Okay.

2345
02:22:05,081 --> 02:22:10,514
MARISHA: Unless she can make a strength save
versus my spell shit.

2346
02:22:10,514 --> 02:22:15,636
MATT: That is a four plus one. No.

2347
02:22:15,636 --> 02:22:24,445
MARISHA: Fail, so she is restrained, and then I'm
going to run, and I'm going to use my Mantle of

2348
02:22:24,445 --> 02:22:36,451
the Tempest to jump, and then trying to be dope,
here, in mid-air, I'm going to change into an

2349
02:22:36,451 --> 02:22:42,895
earth elemental and try and grab onto the bone
dragon and see if I can snap his neck in the

2350
02:22:42,895 --> 02:22:45,521
process. Grapple the bone dragon's head.

2351
02:22:45,521 --> 02:22:47,368
MATT: Okay. Entangle is an action?

2352
02:22:47,368 --> 02:22:54,136
MARISHA: Yes, and then I'm running and jumping and
grabbing for the rest of my movement.

2353
02:22:54,136 --> 02:22:56,034
JOE: Do we need some more tape?

2354
02:22:56,034 --> 02:22:59,516
MATT: Actually, I can finally use the layer over
here.

2355
02:22:59,516 --> 02:23:03,874
LAURA: Do you want me to get the tape?

2356
02:23:03,874 --> 02:23:16,745
MATT: All right, you leap over. That's the rest of your
turn. After entangling her, you run, leap, and as

2357
02:23:16,745 --> 02:23:22,608
the wind from the mantle picks up, you watch this
gust of wind lift her. Make an athletics check.

2358
02:23:22,608 --> 02:23:25,438
LAURA: To try to land on the dragon?

2359
02:23:25,438 --> 02:23:32,398
MARISHA: A straight athletics? Yeah. (whimpers)
11.

2360
02:23:32,398 --> 02:23:40,100
MATT: Okay. Not too bad. That's enough. It was
maybe a 15-foot jump at this point, and it's

2361
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:47,201
tripled because of your mantle, so you leap and
land, transforming into the elemental and

2362
02:23:47,201 --> 02:23:50,796
grappling onto its back. All right. That ends your
turn, Keyleth. Scanlan Two?

2363
02:23:50,796 --> 02:23:53,215
SAM: She's grappled now?

2364
02:23:53,215 --> 02:23:54,506
MATT: She is, yes.

2365
02:23:54,506 --> 02:23:56,453
MARISHA: Yeah. Fuck her shit up!

2366
02:23:56,453 --> 02:23:58,516
TALIESIN: She's prone and grappled.

2367
02:23:58,516 --> 02:24:01,003
MARISHA: Prone and grappled, and not for a very
long time.

2368
02:24:01,003 --> 02:24:04,171
SAM: So if we hit her, it automatically hits,
right?

2369
02:24:04,171 --> 02:24:07,359
MATT: Physically. You get advantage on attacks
against her.

2370
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:11,256
SAM: Is Bigby's Hand a magic attack or a physical
attack? It's a melee spell attack.

2371
02:24:11,256 --> 02:24:13,660
MATT: It's a melee spell, so you get advantage on
the attack roll, yeah.

2372
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:21,237
SAM: Okay, then I'll change my plans and I'll do
that. Scanlan Two will cast Bigby's Hand at

2373
02:24:21,237 --> 02:24:30,469
level-6 and pound her really hard. Shit.

2374
02:24:30,469 --> 02:24:36,315
JOE: Is that a Philip Seymour Hoffman Happiness
reference?

2375
02:24:36,315 --> 02:24:39,353
(laughter)

2376
02:24:39,353 --> 02:24:50,314
SAM: Is that 6d8? Or 8d8? Bigby's Hand; I always
forget.

2377
02:24:50,314 --> 02:25:00,073
MATT: It's 5th-level, and you've cast it at 6th,
correct? So it's an additional 2d8 to the punch.

2378
02:25:00,073 --> 02:25:03,326
SAM: And it starts at 4d8? Oh, so it's only 6d8.

2379
02:25:03,326 --> 02:25:05,416
JOE: Would you like to borrow some d8s?

2380
02:25:05,416 --> 02:25:11,738
SAM: Yes. You know what? I'm going to do it at
level-7, then.

2381
02:25:11,738 --> 02:25:13,135
MATT: You already said 6th.

2382
02:25:13,135 --> 02:25:15,690
SAM: Okay. That's fine. All right, so a bunch of
d8s.

2383
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:19,035
MATT: You have to roll to hit first, so d20 with
advantage.

2384
02:25:19,035 --> 02:25:24,699
SAM: 17 plus 11.

2385
02:25:24,699 --> 02:25:27,744
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so roll your 6d8.

2386
02:25:27,744 --> 02:25:32,445
SAM: Yeah. One, two, three, four, five.

2387
02:25:32,445 --> 02:25:34,297
JOE: Or you can use the Smite dice.

2388
02:25:34,297 --> 02:25:42,225
SAM: I like these. 29.

2389
02:25:42,225 --> 02:25:44,915
MATT: All right.

2390
02:25:44,915 --> 02:25:57,960
SAM: 29, and then I guess, as his bonus action,
he'll inspire Vax, who's not even here.

2391
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:01,343
MATT: Sing to the space where he was.

2392
02:26:01,343 --> 02:26:11,353
SAM: Scanlan Two only knows the songs of Scanlan,
so he will sing, weirdly hollowly: (singing) When

2393
02:26:11,353 --> 02:26:15,406
I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing.

2394
02:26:15,406 --> 02:26:17,591
(laughter)

2395
02:26:17,591 --> 02:26:19,899
SAM: He only knows the songs that he already
knows!

2396
02:26:19,899 --> 02:26:22,259
TRAVIS: I told you, it's the jam.

2397
02:26:22,259 --> 02:26:25,352
MATT: All right, so when he gets back, give him
the d12.

2398
02:26:25,352 --> 02:26:33,216
SAM: And then he moves. He ducks back behind
there. Yeah, just peeking out a little so he can

2399
02:26:33,216 --> 02:26:34,523
see where Bigby's Hand is.

2400
02:26:34,523 --> 02:26:43,082
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, Sylas is going
to use his last legendary action to move his speed

2401
02:26:43,082 --> 02:26:51,533
without provoking opportunity attacks. He leaps
off the side and lands right next to Delilah.

2402
02:26:51,533 --> 02:26:56,211
MARISHA: Does he get entangled? Because he did
just land in difficult terrain.

2403
02:26:56,211 --> 02:27:01,487
MATT: He's not entangled, I don't think, because
he wasn't there for the casting. Difficult terrain

2404
02:27:01,487 --> 02:27:03,704
means he moves across at half.

2405
02:27:03,704 --> 02:27:05,207
MARISHA: He's in difficult terrain.

2406
02:27:05,207 --> 02:27:06,692
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

2407
02:27:06,692 --> 02:27:11,427
MARISHA: I have rocky ground. That's all I have.

2408
02:27:11,427 --> 02:27:26,107
MATT: All righty, so entangled... okay, yeah. Got
it. Cool. That ends the legendary action. Grog,

2409
02:27:26,107 --> 02:27:27,631
you're up.

2410
02:27:27,631 --> 02:27:34,630
TRAVIS: Can I jump to the top of the bannister
here so I'm looking down at old tangled-up

2411
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:47,508
Delilah. (sighs) May I leap off the tower and
straight onto Delilah's prone body?

2412
02:27:47,508 --> 02:27:50,674
MATT: Sure. Make an athletics check.

2413
02:27:50,674 --> 02:27:52,412
SAM: So romantic.

2414
02:27:52,412 --> 02:27:55,624
LAURA: Feet stomping her chest?

2415
02:27:55,624 --> 02:28:02,193
MATT: That's easy enough. Make an athletics check,
actually, in case something goes horribly bad. You

2416
02:28:02,193 --> 02:28:04,297
are raging, so you get advantage.

2417
02:28:04,297 --> 02:28:07,026
TRAVIS: 25.

2418
02:28:07,026 --> 02:28:13,746
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. At that height, you take
eight points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to

2419
02:28:13,746 --> 02:28:21,528
four, and (impact) you land, arcing over her, both
feet to each side of her, and you're standing,

2420
02:28:21,528 --> 02:28:26,026
looming over her body as she's wrapped up in
vines, going (grunting).

2421
02:28:26,026 --> 02:28:31,851
TRAVIS: I fucking hate this dead bitch. And I
raise the sword and start swinging down in these

2422
02:28:31,851 --> 02:28:35,456
huge arcs at her. The first two attacks at her.

2423
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:42,632
MATT: Okay. As you pull the blade up, the voice
goes, "Yes. Her. She's part of the web. Her. Her!"

2424
02:28:42,632 --> 02:28:48,352
And you give into the fury. Go ahead and make your
attacks.

2425
02:28:48,352 --> 02:28:50,681
TRAVIS: Are they with advantage because she's
prone?

2426
02:28:50,681 --> 02:28:52,230
MATT: Correct. Well, she's restrained.

2427
02:28:52,230 --> 02:28:57,616
TRAVIS: So not reckless. Natural 20.

2428
02:28:57,616 --> 02:29:01,278
(cheering)

2429
02:29:01,278 --> 02:29:02,959
SAM: She's going to die.

2430
02:29:02,959 --> 02:29:05,758
LIAM: Butcher that motherfucker!

2431
02:29:05,758 --> 02:29:08,036
TRAVIS: Should I roll the second attack?

2432
02:29:08,036 --> 02:29:12,871
MATT: Roll the damage first. She's hurt, but she's
not terrible. Yet.

2433
02:29:12,871 --> 02:29:14,539
JOE: She's about to be terrible.

2434
02:29:14,539 --> 02:29:15,857
MATT: Yeah.

2435
02:29:15,857 --> 02:29:25,596
TRAVIS: (counting) 21 plus 14. Help me. 35?

2436
02:29:25,596 --> 02:29:26,654
LAURA: 35.

2437
02:29:26,654 --> 02:29:27,817
TRAVIS: 35.

2438
02:29:27,817 --> 02:29:32,395
MARISHA: 21 plus 14? Yeah.

2439
02:29:32,395 --> 02:29:39,731
TRAVIS: 35, okay. So that's those. Let me make
sure I'm doing this right. Oh, that's before the

2440
02:29:39,731 --> 02:29:40,930
modifier.

2441
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:42,267
LAURA: 35 times two now?

2442
02:29:42,267 --> 02:29:43,526
TRAVIS: Just 35.

2443
02:29:43,526 --> 02:29:45,298
LIAM: Modifier goes on at the end.

2444
02:29:45,298 --> 02:29:49,040
ASHLEY: What is it?

2445
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,069
TRAVIS: 51.

2446
02:29:51,069 --> 02:29:59,415
LAURA: What do you get for the crit on Kas? What
do you get for the crit? That's why I'm asking if

2447
02:29:59,415 --> 02:30:01,087
you double your dice.

2448
02:30:01,087 --> 02:30:05,249
TRAVIS: No, I mean my brutal critical. I roll the
damage die, an additional--

2449
02:30:05,249 --> 02:30:09,898
MATT: You roll the damage die, double that, add
the modifiers, and then the additional damage.

2450
02:30:09,898 --> 02:30:11,106
MARISHA: And you're raging right?

2451
02:30:11,106 --> 02:30:12,575
TRAVIS: Two times, yeah.

2452
02:30:12,575 --> 02:30:14,265
MARISHA: Plus your rage damage, don't forget to
double that.

2453
02:30:14,265 --> 02:30:16,040
TRAVIS: Two damage dies at this level.

2454
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:17,081
MATT: We'll see--

2455
02:30:17,081 --> 02:30:19,771
JOE: This is that crazy new sword.

2456
02:30:19,771 --> 02:30:21,518
MATT: Three, at 17th level.

2457
02:30:21,518 --> 02:30:22,574
TRAVIS: Three?

2458
02:30:22,574 --> 02:30:24,240
MATT: Yeah, so 3d10 additional.

2459
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,686
LAURA: Oh my god, so 51 plus 3d10.

2460
02:30:26,686 --> 02:30:27,723
MATT: Correct.

2461
02:30:27,723 --> 02:30:28,723
MARISHA: And is that doubled too?

2462
02:30:28,723 --> 02:30:29,578
LAURA: No.

2463
02:30:29,578 --> 02:30:30,392
MARISHA: Okay.

2464
02:30:30,392 --> 02:30:31,925
SAM: That would be crazy.

2465
02:30:31,925 --> 02:30:35,304
TRAVIS: 62. I rolled pretty low.

2466
02:30:35,304 --> 02:30:41,740
MATT: Okay, so as you bring the blade down, with
this horrible screaming hiss--

2467
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,963
LAURA: That's one hit?

2468
02:30:42,963 --> 02:30:50,566
MATT: Yeah, 62 points of damage. The blade jams
into her chest, and as you twist it she screams,

2469
02:30:50,566 --> 02:30:55,982
and the blood from the wounds sprays out in the
middle of the air, freezes, and then slips into

2470
02:30:55,982 --> 02:31:00,941
the blade as it's sucking up the blood. She's
like (grunts) entangled, and she reaches up and

2471
02:31:00,941 --> 02:31:04,694
grabs the blade, and begins to start pulling it
out of the wound, she's (choking) as blood begins

2472
02:31:04,694 --> 02:31:06,790
splattering up around her mouth, but she's still
alive.

2473
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:10,501
TRAVIS: Did you want it out? Here, let me help you
out (yells) and put it back in!

2474
02:31:10,501 --> 02:31:12,611
MATT: Roll again.

2475
02:31:12,611 --> 02:31:19,806
TRAVIS: That is a 32.

2476
02:31:19,806 --> 02:31:21,517
MATT: Okay, roll damage.

2477
02:31:21,517 --> 02:31:26,188
LAURA: I like it when the music stops, we're like
(hyperventilates).

2478
02:31:26,188 --> 02:31:32,629
TRAVIS: 24.

2479
02:31:32,629 --> 02:31:39,668
MATT: 24. You jam the blade in a second time, and
gash across and it carves open this part of her

2480
02:31:39,668 --> 02:31:43,969
chest, and you can see the blood spatter out. The
bones are exposed, and she's on the ground,

2481
02:31:43,969 --> 02:31:49,827
shaking. She's hanging on by a tether, and her
eyes are going wild, and she glances over, and her

2482
02:31:49,827 --> 02:31:55,153
hand goes out. And you can see Sylas, who's right
next to her, his eyes are wide and he's reaching

2483
02:31:55,153 --> 02:31:57,209
out to grasp for her hand.

2484
02:31:57,209 --> 02:31:58,816
LAURA: (gravelly) Chop her hand off!

2485
02:31:58,816 --> 02:32:01,075
MATT: Is that the end of your turn? Oh, you're
frenzied raging? Right.

2486
02:32:01,075 --> 02:32:02,520
TALIESIN: Oh no. Yeah!

2487
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:03,680
MARISHA: Come on, come on Grog!

2488
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,366
TRAVIS: I was going to do something to Sylas but
fuck it, we're going to hit her.

2489
02:32:05,366 --> 02:32:07,044
SAM: (whispered) Chop off her hand.

2490
02:32:07,044 --> 02:32:10,014
LAURA: Chop off her whole arm.

2491
02:32:10,014 --> 02:32:13,888
TRAVIS: 33 to hit.

2492
02:32:13,888 --> 02:32:15,606
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2493
02:32:15,606 --> 02:32:20,375
LAURA: (singing) Please die Deliah, we want you
dead.

2494
02:32:20,375 --> 02:32:22,720
TALIESIN: Third time's the charm.

2495
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:24,103
TRAVIS: 23.

2496
02:32:24,103 --> 02:32:33,981
MATT: 23 points of damage? Are you rolling extra
undead damage on this? On these attacks? Because

2497
02:32:33,981 --> 02:32:35,261
she's not undead.

2498
02:32:35,261 --> 02:32:39,132
TRAVIS: Nope, nope. 23 plus-- I wasn't even
adding-- I was so excited about the sword damage I

2499
02:32:39,132 --> 02:32:41,132
was forgetting my rage damage.

2500
02:32:41,132 --> 02:32:43,623
MATT: Right, but you rolled 3d10 there.

2501
02:32:43,623 --> 02:32:49,389
TRAVIS: I did, yeah. The d10 plus 2d10 slashing
damage to undead right?

2502
02:32:49,389 --> 02:32:50,725
MATT: She's not undead though.

2503
02:32:50,725 --> 02:32:51,591
TRAVIS: Oh, she's not?

2504
02:32:51,591 --> 02:32:52,668
MATT: No.

2505
02:32:52,668 --> 02:32:53,430
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2506
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:57,797
MATT: You've been adding that to all the attacks?
Okay, noted. Roll--

2507
02:32:57,797 --> 02:32:59,930
TRAVIS: I figured she was dead, then not dead--

2508
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:03,795
MATT: Roll 4d10 for me right now. I'm going to
retract that from the damage she's taken.

2509
02:33:03,795 --> 02:33:08,523
TRAVIS: 22.

2510
02:33:08,523 --> 02:33:15,350
MATT: She's still wounded, but she's not hanging
on by that thread. Okay, so the damage you rolled

2511
02:33:15,350 --> 02:33:17,116
for that attack?

2512
02:33:17,116 --> 02:33:20,233
TRAVIS: 24. But I hadn't added my--

2513
02:33:20,233 --> 02:33:22,119
LAURA: So do your damage again because that--

2514
02:33:22,119 --> 02:33:23,515
MATT: Roll the d10 and add your modifiers.

2515
02:33:23,515 --> 02:33:25,181
TRAVIS: Okay fair enough. Shit, I'm so sorry.

2516
02:33:25,181 --> 02:33:26,173
MATT: It's okay.

2517
02:33:26,173 --> 02:33:30,056
LAURA: He wasn't doing his rage modifiers, so you
could add that then, potentially?

2518
02:33:30,056 --> 02:33:31,870
MARISHA: The difference.

2519
02:33:31,870 --> 02:33:33,155
TRAVIS: So that's 21.

2520
02:33:33,155 --> 02:33:36,081
SAM: With your rage?

2521
02:33:36,081 --> 02:33:37,148
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2522
02:33:37,148 --> 02:33:41,102
MATT: So as you hack in a third time with the
blade, making a smear of blood across the ground,

2523
02:33:41,102 --> 02:33:47,752
the entangled vines that hold her there are
soaked in crimson at this point. And she's

2524
02:33:47,752 --> 02:33:50,992
coughing and sputtering, you can see the open
wounds in her chest, and her hand reaching out

2525
02:33:50,992 --> 02:33:55,977
"Sylas." And he's going for her at that point.
That's the end of your turn. She's still alive.

2526
02:33:55,977 --> 02:33:57,305
TRAVIS: Yep.

2527
02:33:57,305 --> 02:33:58,919
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2528
02:33:58,919 --> 02:34:00,174
ASHLEY: Good job.

2529
02:34:00,174 --> 02:34:02,083
TRAVIS: I thought she was undead, just figured.

2530
02:34:02,083 --> 02:34:03,913
MATT: No, she's alive.

2531
02:34:03,913 --> 02:34:05,639
JOE: She's a clone.

2532
02:34:05,639 --> 02:34:08,625
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

2533
02:34:08,625 --> 02:34:10,453
MARISHA: Yeah, I was wondering about that.

2534
02:34:10,453 --> 02:34:12,317
TRAVIS: Sylas is undead.

2535
02:34:12,317 --> 02:34:13,316
MATT: Correct.

2536
02:34:13,316 --> 02:34:14,410
TRAVIS: The dragon's undead.

2537
02:34:14,410 --> 02:34:15,851
JOE: No, because I've faced her before.

2538
02:34:15,851 --> 02:34:17,424
TRAVIS: Are the gloomstalkers undead?

2539
02:34:17,424 --> 02:34:18,907
MATT: No.

2540
02:34:18,907 --> 02:34:20,642
TRAVIS: Not undead?

2541
02:34:20,642 --> 02:34:22,091
LAURA: I bet she's a fucking clone.

2542
02:34:22,091 --> 02:34:23,463
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

2543
02:34:23,463 --> 02:34:24,677
LAURA: She made a clone of herself.

2544
02:34:24,677 --> 02:34:28,007
MATT: That ends your turn. Vex.

2545
02:34:28,007 --> 02:34:32,214
LAURA: Okay, so if I attack her, it's at
disadvantage? Or with--

2546
02:34:32,214 --> 02:34:35,593
MATT: With a ranged attack? Yes, because she is--
well, she's restrained, which gives her advantage,

2547
02:34:35,593 --> 02:34:38,707
so technically, it would be just a regular attack
roll.

2548
02:34:38,707 --> 02:34:46,737
LAURA: Well then I'm going to attack her. She's
already restrained. Fuck it, I'm going to attack

2549
02:34:46,737 --> 02:34:49,491
her with a blazing bowstring.

2550
02:34:49,491 --> 02:34:50,734
MATT: Go for it.

2551
02:34:50,734 --> 02:34:52,428
MARISHA: Kill her, kill her.

2552
02:34:52,428 --> 02:34:58,671
LAURA: Yes. 17 plus 14, with sharpshooter.

2553
02:34:58,671 --> 02:35:00,059
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2554
02:35:00,059 --> 02:35:24,716
LAURA: Minus five. Oh god, 15 plus two is 17, 25,
30, plus the blazing bowstring, 37. That's

2555
02:35:24,716 --> 02:35:25,886
everything, right?

2556
02:35:25,886 --> 02:35:27,518
TALIESIN: Did you do your plus ten for the
Sharpshooter?

2557
02:35:27,518 --> 02:35:28,941
LAURA: 47 for Sharpshooter!

2558
02:35:28,941 --> 02:35:30,045
TRAVIS: Hunter's Mark?

2559
02:35:30,045 --> 02:35:31,521
LAURA: 47, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.

2560
02:35:31,521 --> 02:35:34,618
MATT: 47 points of damage with the Sharpshooter.
How do you want to do this?

2561
02:35:34,618 --> 02:35:38,171
(cheering)

2562
02:35:38,171 --> 02:35:40,345
MARISHA: Get it girl! Get it girl!

2563
02:35:40,345 --> 02:35:44,822
MATT: She was reaching out for that Dimension
Door.

2564
02:35:44,822 --> 02:35:47,615
LAURA: Oh fuck!

2565
02:35:47,615 --> 02:35:54,431
MATT: You see her hand reaching out, and you see
her fingers tracing the incantation in the air as

2566
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:58,382
Sylas' hand reaches outstretched for hers.

2567
02:35:58,382 --> 02:36:04,287
LAURA: I point my finger down at her as I'm about
to shoot the arrow. As it shoots, I keep pointing

2568
02:36:04,287 --> 02:36:07,337
at her like: How's it feel, bitch? How's it feel?

2569
02:36:07,337 --> 02:36:12,407
MATT: As she reaches out, her eyes are locked with
Sylas. She's not even paying attention to Grog at

2570
02:36:12,407 --> 02:36:15,045
this point, all she's focused on is escape. And
Grog as you look down at her and Sylas is looking

2571
02:36:15,045 --> 02:36:20,504
into her face reaching out, the arrow just
(impact) through the jaw and out the side of her

2572
02:36:20,504 --> 02:36:27,325
cheek there. (breath catches) and her eyes go
cold. The spell incantation fades and the hand

2573
02:36:27,325 --> 02:36:30,924
just twitches and falls to the ground still.

2574
02:36:30,924 --> 02:36:33,819
MARISHIA: That was so dope!

2575
02:36:33,819 --> 02:36:35,047
ASHLEY: Yes!

2576
02:36:35,047 --> 02:36:39,381
MATT: As that happens, Sylas, his hand still
reached out goes (yelling) "No!"

2577
02:36:39,381 --> 02:36:44,976
LAURA: Oh I feel so bad for him.

2578
02:36:44,976 --> 02:36:46,368
TRAVIS: No you don't.

2579
02:36:46,368 --> 02:36:47,721
LAURA: I do have another attack!

2580
02:36:47,721 --> 02:36:53,379
MATT: He turns around to look at you, "Vengeance,
I suppose, is mine this time."

2581
02:36:53,379 --> 02:36:55,862
LAURA: And I attack him.

2582
02:36:55,862 --> 02:36:58,413
MATT: This is a unique reversal of last time.

2583
02:36:58,413 --> 02:37:02,175
LAURA: With blazing bowstring.

2584
02:37:02,175 --> 02:37:03,221
MATT: Okay.

2585
02:37:03,221 --> 02:37:08,629
LAURA: Sharpshooter. So 28 minus five hits?

2586
02:37:08,629 --> 02:37:16,854
MATT: 28 minus five, yeah, that hits. That is the
end of Delilah Briarwood.

2587
02:37:16,854 --> 02:37:18,367
TRAVIS: Like done?

2588
02:37:18,367 --> 02:37:21,587
MATT: Clones take a while.

2589
02:37:21,587 --> 02:37:33,300
LAURA: 33 damage to him. Seven of which is fire
damage.

2590
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:36,570
MATT: Gotcha. Is that the end of your turn?

2591
02:37:36,570 --> 02:37:38,765
TRAVIS: Were her hands her own hands?

2592
02:37:38,765 --> 02:37:40,875
MATT: They seemed to be.

2593
02:37:40,875 --> 02:37:54,304
LAURA: I'm going to run down the stairs to the
lower level. Yeah, I'm in there.

2594
02:37:54,304 --> 02:38:06,764
MATT: Okay. All right, first things first. As soon
as Delilah's body goes lifeless, Keyleth, you feel

2595
02:38:06,764 --> 02:38:13,499
this sudden shift beneath your feet, as the bone
structure that maintains the body of the skeletal

2596
02:38:13,499 --> 02:38:16,485
dragon collapses entirely.

2597
02:38:16,485 --> 02:38:19,407
(cheering)

2598
02:38:19,407 --> 02:38:21,200
LAURA: Two with one!

2599
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:29,468
TALIESIN: I was going to feel really guilty about
killing that thing.

2600
02:38:29,468 --> 02:38:37,100
MATT: You suffer 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

2601
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:38,720
MARISHA: That's fine.

2602
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:42,638
MATT: Percy, you're up.

2603
02:38:42,638 --> 02:38:48,558
TALIESIN: I want to try and come around here if
possible.

2604
02:38:48,558 --> 02:38:51,769
MATT: With a speed of 30 you can do that, yeah.

2605
02:38:51,769 --> 02:38:56,304
TALIESIN: Just here.

2606
02:38:56,304 --> 02:38:58,469
SAM: Matt, don't forget those two guys.

2607
02:38:58,469 --> 02:39:01,919
MATT: They just got there last turn.

2608
02:39:01,919 --> 02:39:09,166
LAURA: Delilah's dead!

2609
02:39:09,166 --> 02:39:12,551
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

2610
02:39:12,551 --> 02:39:20,686
TALIESIN: First thing I'm doing is I'm taking a
grit shot at Sylas with Animus. And I'm doing

2611
02:39:20,686 --> 02:39:24,415
a headshot just to make his life a little more
complicated.

2612
02:39:24,415 --> 02:39:26,458
LIAM: Do you get them at Reproductions, too?

2613
02:39:26,458 --> 02:39:31,234
TALIESIN: I do, I'm taking very nice head shots.
Actually, I go to Prints Charming.

2614
02:39:31,234 --> 02:39:33,052
MARISHIA: Do you really?

2615
02:39:33,052 --> 02:39:35,061
SAM: That is not a place.

2616
02:39:35,061 --> 02:39:37,185
TALIESIN: That's a real place. It's on Ventura.

2617
02:39:37,185 --> 02:39:39,758
MATT: Percy! Roll your attack!

2618
02:39:39,758 --> 02:39:43,929
TALIESIN: Sorry! The most LA moment in our game
ever! Just now!

2619
02:39:43,929 --> 02:39:45,324
LIAM: I don't know about that.

2620
02:39:45,324 --> 02:39:54,101
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, maybe not. Yep, that'll do,
that's a 26 to hit?

2621
02:39:54,101 --> 02:39:55,471
MATT: That'll hit!

2622
02:39:55,471 --> 02:40:00,280
TALIESIN: And he has to make a constitution saving
throw.

2623
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:04,499
MATT: Okay, He's going to use legendary resistance
to succeed.

2624
02:40:04,499 --> 02:40:06,145
TALIESIN: That's fine.

2625
02:40:06,145 --> 02:40:08,414
TRAVIS: His first one?

2626
02:40:08,414 --> 02:40:09,703
MATT: His first one.

2627
02:40:09,703 --> 02:40:15,794
TALIESIN: He still takes 16 points of damage and
two points of psychic damage.

2628
02:40:15,794 --> 02:40:18,960
MATT: All righty, 18, got it.

2629
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:29,944
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take another headshot,
because that's funny. And that's 31 to hit.

2630
02:40:29,944 --> 02:40:31,665
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

2631
02:40:31,665 --> 02:40:41,938
TALIESIN: That's 12 points of damage and one
psychic damage. And does he make his constitution

2632
02:40:41,938 --> 02:40:43,556
saving throw?

2633
02:40:43,556 --> 02:40:45,586
MATT: He does actually, what's the DC on it?

2634
02:40:45,586 --> 02:40:47,104
TALIESIN: The DC is 20.

2635
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:48,557
MATT: He rolled 20 exactly.

2636
02:40:48,557 --> 02:40:54,345
TALIESIN: Fine. I'm going to take another
headshot. Burning my grit.

2637
02:40:54,345 --> 02:40:57,856
SAM: Pew pew!

2638
02:40:57,856 --> 02:41:06,781
TALIESIN: I should have gone for a Sharpshooter.
That's 34 to hit, Jesus Christ.

2639
02:41:06,781 --> 02:41:08,093
MATT: That hits.

2640
02:41:08,093 --> 02:41:10,235
TALIESIN: Another constitution saving throw.

2641
02:41:10,235 --> 02:41:12,557
MATT: That is a 20 again!

2642
02:41:12,557 --> 02:41:13,570
TALIESIN: God, motherfucker!

2643
02:41:13,570 --> 02:41:15,222
MATT: 16 plus four both times.

2644
02:41:15,222 --> 02:41:20,388
TALIESIN: That's 15 points of damage plus four
psychic. So 19 total.

2645
02:41:20,388 --> 02:41:25,107
MATT: As he's there, his arm out, and he's
seething with rage, his eyes burning bright red,

2646
02:41:25,107 --> 02:41:31,292
like the same shade as Grog's, which is
disconcerting. Each bullet hits him and he doesn't

2647
02:41:31,292 --> 02:41:40,008
react. (bullets hitting) He's just looking down at
her and back up at Vex and down at her. Is that

2648
02:41:40,008 --> 02:41:41,439
your turn?

2649
02:41:41,439 --> 02:41:46,936
TALIESIN: No, I don't like the way he's doing
that, I'm burning an action surge. I'm going to

2650
02:41:46,936 --> 02:41:56,404
use some Sharpshooter. I'm going to burn a bonus
and reload my gun. Let's just take three

2651
02:41:56,404 --> 02:41:59,502
Sharpshooter shots, see what happens.

2652
02:41:59,502 --> 02:42:04,396
MARISHIA: That one's cocked, I think.

2653
02:42:04,396 --> 02:42:06,361
MATT: No, they're there.

2654
02:42:06,361 --> 02:42:08,110
TALIESIN: I should not have rolled all three at
once.

2655
02:42:08,110 --> 02:42:09,736
MATT: Oh well.

2656
02:42:09,736 --> 02:42:24,359
TALIESIN: The way they landed, it would have been
the third one anyway. Two shots, that's 15 to hit? No.

2657
02:42:24,359 --> 02:42:29,522
MATT: 15 misses. He puts a hand up without even
watching and deflects the bullet from the air.

2658
02:42:29,522 --> 02:42:31,060
LAURA: He deflects the bullet?!

2659
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:32,237
TALIESIN: 20 to hit.

2660
02:42:32,237 --> 02:42:36,921
MATT: 20 to hit? He's going to use his reaction to use
parry and the second bullet, with the other hand he

2661
02:42:36,921 --> 02:42:42,164
shoots it off to the side. Not even looking at you
just staring at Vex still.

2662
02:42:42,164 --> 02:42:44,068
LAURA: He's looking at me? Oh no.

2663
02:42:44,068 --> 02:42:46,041
TALIESIN: And the third shots jams at a two.

2664
02:42:46,041 --> 02:42:49,885
LAURA: No I ran away! He can't see me! I'm
downstairs.

2665
02:42:49,885 --> 02:42:52,319
MATT: Glaring at the space you were when you ran.

2666
02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:54,746
TRAVIS: Yeah, through all material.

2667
02:42:54,746 --> 02:43:01,950
TALIESIN: Actually I have a resistance now to
psychic damage, so I take 1d6 psychic damage for

2668
02:43:01,950 --> 02:43:03,700
my gun, not two, correct?

2669
02:43:03,700 --> 02:43:04,847
MATT: Okay, yes you do.

2670
02:43:04,847 --> 02:43:07,213
TALIESIN: I take my four points and I am happy for
them.

2671
02:43:07,213 --> 02:43:08,131
MATT: That ends your turn!

2672
02:43:08,131 --> 02:43:09,073
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

2673
02:43:09,073 --> 02:43:10,229
MATT: Arkhan.

2674
02:43:10,229 --> 02:43:11,378
SAM: Come on, Arkhan.

2675
02:43:11,378 --> 02:43:15,522
JOE: I command the gloomstalker to shriek. I just
read this.

2676
02:43:15,522 --> 02:43:17,340
LAURA: What does it do when he shrieks?

2677
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:22,483
JOE: Within 60 feet, the gloomstalker emits a
terrible, shattering shriek that impacts all

2678
02:43:22,483 --> 02:43:27,969
hostile creatures. Each must make a DC 16
constitution save or become stunned until the

2679
02:43:27,969 --> 02:43:29,976
end of their next turn.

2680
02:43:29,976 --> 02:43:31,234
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

2681
02:43:31,234 --> 02:43:34,990
JOE: And it's the two up there, right?

2682
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:44,205
MATT: Technically they are, yeah. That's what they
were going to do next turn. So that's a two on the

2683
02:43:44,205 --> 02:43:56,243
one gloomstalker. That is a 14, they both fail.
Both of the other gloomstalkers, all of a sudden

2684
02:43:56,243 --> 02:44:02,489
(croaking) their heads begin writhing around. They
are stunned until their next turn. And Sylas is

2685
02:44:02,489 --> 02:44:07,720
going to use his second legendary resistance of
the day.

2686
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:09,713
MARISHIA: We can burn him out. Burn him out.

2687
02:44:09,713 --> 02:44:12,325
JOE: And now I'm unimpeded, direct. All the
way to him.

2688
02:44:12,325 --> 02:44:13,969
MATT: Correct.

2689
02:44:13,969 --> 02:44:15,248
LAURA: Destroy him!

2690
02:44:15,248 --> 02:44:18,533
MATT: Fly this over to him.

2691
02:44:18,533 --> 02:44:22,882
TALIESIN: High-five Keyleth on the way in.

2692
02:44:22,882 --> 02:44:29,101
MATT: Cool! And?

2693
02:44:29,101 --> 02:44:35,919
JOE: Okay and I'm going to do reckless on this.

2694
02:44:35,919 --> 02:44:37,112
ASHLEY: Yeah you are.

2695
02:44:37,112 --> 02:44:38,752
TRAVIS: Atta boy!

2696
02:44:38,752 --> 02:44:48,724
LAURA: I like the magical flourish of the die.

2697
02:44:48,724 --> 02:44:51,369
JOE: It's like some David Copperfield.

2698
02:44:51,369 --> 02:44:52,673
MATT: Exactly.

2699
02:44:52,673 --> 02:44:54,508
MARISHIA: Just salt bae your dice.

2700
02:44:54,508 --> 02:44:55,512
JOE: Does 32 hit?

2701
02:44:55,512 --> 02:44:56,512
MATT: 32 does hit.

2702
02:44:56,512 --> 02:44:58,256
JOE: Okay great. Is this guy undead?

2703
02:44:58,256 --> 02:45:00,299
MATT: Yes he is. He is a vampire.

2704
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:05,973
JOE: Out of curiosity, the bones of Delilah. She
deflated like a bag?

2705
02:45:05,973 --> 02:45:09,780
MATT: She's dead. The skeleton fell into piles of
bones.

2706
02:45:09,780 --> 02:45:11,275
SAM: She's okay.

2707
02:45:11,275 --> 02:45:12,356
MATT: She's not okay.

2708
02:45:12,356 --> 02:45:13,762
JOE: She's not a zombie.

2709
02:45:13,762 --> 02:45:19,639
MATT: She's a slashed-up human. Her whole torso is
a mess. She has an arrow through her jaw and cheek.

2710
02:45:19,639 --> 02:45:21,200
LAURA: Out her eyeball.

2711
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:35,980
JOE: Great. Well, then I would like to do a
2nd-level Divine Smite, which is going to be 6d8.

2712
02:45:35,980 --> 02:45:40,156
TRAVIS: 6d8? Holy shit.

2713
02:45:40,156 --> 02:45:49,143
JOE: I rolled badly. That's a 28.

2714
02:45:49,143 --> 02:45:51,924
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's bad? Oh man.

2715
02:45:51,924 --> 02:45:58,162
MATT: 28 points. All right, so as you rush forward
with your axe, you swing down into Sylas, who gets

2716
02:45:58,162 --> 02:46:03,080
slammed in the side of the shoulder, and as the
spark of the Divine Smite energy slams into his

2717
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:08,206
side, you can see him: he's starting to feel the
pinch, all of you surrounding him.

2718
02:46:08,206 --> 02:46:11,158
JOE: That's a cock.

2719
02:46:11,158 --> 02:46:14,370
MATT: Roll again. It's a dice, actually.

2720
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:20,062
JOE: That's not great. That's 19.

2721
02:46:20,062 --> 02:46:22,595
MATT: 19 does not hit, unfortunately.

2722
02:46:22,595 --> 02:46:25,506
JOE: I would like to frenzy.

2723
02:46:25,506 --> 02:46:29,413
MATT: Okay, so you're rolling your third strike.

2724
02:46:29,413 --> 02:46:31,857
JOE: Frenzy, reckless.

2725
02:46:31,857 --> 02:46:33,252
MATT: Yeah.

2726
02:46:33,252 --> 02:46:37,049
JOE: That's going to be a 27.

2727
02:46:37,049 --> 02:46:40,114
MATT: 27 hits. Roll damage.

2728
02:46:40,114 --> 02:46:43,519
MARISHA: Kill him!

2729
02:46:43,519 --> 02:46:45,590
JOE: I'll go 2nd-level Divine Smite again.

2730
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:50,155
TRAVIS: Come on, now!

2731
02:46:50,155 --> 02:46:59,371
JOE: My friend John bought me some smite dice.
Let's go. Oh man, that's not a lot. That's rough,

2732
02:46:59,371 --> 02:47:00,773
isn't it?

2733
02:47:00,773 --> 02:47:03,345
MARISHA: Goddamn it, John.

2734
02:47:03,345 --> 02:47:10,373
JOE: That's a 29, which was a terrible roll.

2735
02:47:10,373 --> 02:47:18,578
MATT: First attack slams into it and bursts.
Second one, you swing and Sylas' form turns to

2736
02:47:18,578 --> 02:47:23,526
shadow temporarily and dissipates around the blade
and returns. The third hit does strike true in the

2737
02:47:23,526 --> 02:47:28,441
back of the head. (yelps) He yelps out in pain as
the blast bursts upward. You can see the flesh

2738
02:47:28,441 --> 02:47:31,344
burning from the impact of the radiant damage.
That end your turn?

2739
02:47:31,344 --> 02:47:34,336
JOE: I believe it will do so, yes.

2740
02:47:34,336 --> 02:47:38,472
MATT: That brings us to Sylas' turn. Sylas does
not regenerate because the radiant damage kept it

2741
02:47:38,472 --> 02:47:40,080
at bay.

2742
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:42,006
TRAVIS: I did not know that.

2743
02:47:42,006 --> 02:47:45,417
JOE: It's why I did divine.

2744
02:47:45,417 --> 02:47:49,474
MATT: Radiant damage prevented his regeneration.
Looking at his current circumstance, he's going to--

2745
02:47:49,474 --> 02:47:50,660
MARISHA: No!

2746
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:54,565
MATT: You watch as he glances around and his body
(whoosh) into a bat.

2747
02:47:54,565 --> 02:47:57,320
SAM: Scanlan Two's going to cast Counterspell.

2748
02:47:57,320 --> 02:47:58,858
MATT: It's not a spell.

2749
02:47:58,858 --> 02:48:00,317
(groaning)

2750
02:48:00,317 --> 02:48:04,294
MATT: Scanlan Two goes to counter it, but there's
no spell to counter.

2751
02:48:04,294 --> 02:48:06,001
MARISHA: Vampire bullshit!

2752
02:48:06,001 --> 02:48:08,112
MATT: Turns into a bat (fluttering).

2753
02:48:08,112 --> 02:48:12,110
MARISHA: I have a reaction! Can Keyleth the ellie
try to grab it?

2754
02:48:12,110 --> 02:48:16,255
MATT: You don't get to grab, you get an attack of
opportunity.

2755
02:48:16,255 --> 02:48:17,854
MARISHA: Can I?

2756
02:48:17,854 --> 02:48:22,315
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity. <i>You</i> get
an attack of opportunity, and Grog gets an attack

2757
02:48:22,315 --> 02:48:23,438
of opportunity.

2758
02:48:23,438 --> 02:48:24,497
LAURA: And Bigby's Hand.

2759
02:48:24,497 --> 02:48:25,541
MATT: Bigby's Hand does not get reactions.

2760
02:48:25,541 --> 02:48:26,805
JOE: Does They get a attack of opportunity?

2761
02:48:26,805 --> 02:48:28,072
MATT: Yeah, one attack.

2762
02:48:28,072 --> 02:48:31,429
SAM: Against a bat.

2763
02:48:31,429 --> 02:48:36,242
TALIESIN: Which means if you hit him enough, he
drops back to human.

2764
02:48:36,242 --> 02:48:41,711
MATT: That's not how a vampire bat form works.
It's not a Polymorph. He has the same hit points

2765
02:48:41,711 --> 02:48:43,403
in the bat form as he does in his normal form.

2766
02:48:43,403 --> 02:48:46,392
TRAVIS: What if I made this a reckless tripping
attack?

2767
02:48:46,392 --> 02:48:50,475
LAURA: Does that work on a bat? Can you trip a
bat?

2768
02:48:50,475 --> 02:48:56,963
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't know if it would
ground him for one second or not. I don't know.

2769
02:48:56,963 --> 02:48:59,922
That's why I'm asking the DM.

2770
02:48:59,922 --> 02:49:02,261
JOE: Who goes first out of all these attacks of
opportunity?

2771
02:49:02,261 --> 02:49:03,513
MATT: You go first.

2772
02:49:03,513 --> 02:49:07,356
JOE: Okay, then I would like to attempt to snatch
the bat with gloomstalker.

2773
02:49:07,356 --> 02:49:09,097
MARISHA: Yes! Come on, yes!

2774
02:49:09,097 --> 02:49:10,735
JOE: Has a snatch.

2775
02:49:10,735 --> 02:49:12,042
MATT: Okay.

2776
02:49:12,042 --> 02:49:13,866
MARISHA: Snatch that bat!

2777
02:49:13,866 --> 02:49:15,594
ASHLEY: Get that snatch.

2778
02:49:15,594 --> 02:49:18,585
MATT: Roll an attack.

2779
02:49:18,585 --> 02:49:23,268
JOE: That's a 24.

2780
02:49:23,268 --> 02:49:25,166
MATT: 24 hits.

2781
02:49:25,166 --> 02:49:26,495
JOE: Snatched!

2782
02:49:26,495 --> 02:49:27,903
SAM: What does that mean, snatched?

2783
02:49:27,903 --> 02:49:35,010
JOE: The target is grappled. The target is
considered restrained. I can also fly with my

2784
02:49:35,010 --> 02:49:43,032
grappled target at half of my speed. It's 2d6 plus
six piercing damage. Right?

2785
02:49:43,032 --> 02:49:45,209
SAM: He doesn't like this.

2786
02:49:45,209 --> 02:49:51,681
MATT: Because the snatch is a special attack,
essentially, as a reaction, because a reaction

2787
02:49:51,681 --> 02:49:59,258
gives you a melee attack; it's not an actual
attack towards him-- let me double-check here for

2788
02:49:59,258 --> 02:50:00,975
you guys real fast.

2789
02:50:00,975 --> 02:50:06,152
JOE: Was that me trying to sneak one by?

2790
02:50:06,152 --> 02:50:10,737
SAM: No. No, it doesn't say that it's special. Why
don't you plan a backup, just in case?

2791
02:50:10,737 --> 02:50:19,042
MATT: Just double checking here. Okay.

2792
02:50:19,042 --> 02:50:21,779
LIAM: How are you doing there, M?

2793
02:50:21,779 --> 02:50:23,108
MARISHA: I'm nervous.

2794
02:50:23,108 --> 02:50:24,504
TALIESIN: It's our fidget spinner.

2795
02:50:24,504 --> 02:50:26,857
LAURA: I need a food for my nervousness.

2796
02:50:26,857 --> 02:50:30,092
TALIESIN: I will let you know if it snaps while
it's in your teeth it hurts a lot. I know that

2797
02:50:30,092 --> 02:50:31,369
from experience.

2798
02:50:31,369 --> 02:50:34,105
MARISHA: Yeah, this is like what Dr. Seuss warns
us about as kids.

2799
02:50:34,105 --> 02:50:35,542
LAURA: You could break your tooth.

2800
02:50:35,542 --> 02:50:42,157
SAM: Guys, what are those shirts? Can you hold up
that shirt again? Oh, there it is.

2801
02:50:42,157 --> 02:50:47,065
TALIESIN: This is the face Matt's not making right
now.

2802
02:50:47,065 --> 02:50:53,734
JOE: After, if you want to enter the raffle, I'm
not sure how this works, but I brought this shirt.

2803
02:50:53,734 --> 02:51:02,330
We're going to rub it all over Travis at break and
then the winner is going to get this shirt. These

2804
02:51:02,330 --> 02:51:04,157
only come in extra large.

2805
02:51:04,157 --> 02:51:08,447
MATT: I will say because I don't allow monsters
to use special attacks as reactions and haven't

2806
02:51:08,447 --> 02:51:11,875
used them the entire game against you guys,
because that would've been much more dangerous, I

2807
02:51:11,875 --> 02:51:14,306
won't allow it for this circumstance, but it does
still do the damage on the regular attack.

2808
02:51:14,306 --> 02:51:19,671
JOE: Fine. Okay, great, then I'm going to bite
this right in the fucking nose.

2809
02:51:19,671 --> 02:51:22,240
MATT: It'll still hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2810
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:25,648
ASHLEY: It can also be a Halloween costume.

2811
02:51:25,648 --> 02:51:26,971
SAM: Ooh!

2812
02:51:26,971 --> 02:51:30,737
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! Matthew Mercer?!

2813
02:51:30,737 --> 02:51:34,301
MATT: This got really weird suddenly.

2814
02:51:34,301 --> 02:51:38,899
TALIESIN: We're going to show up to the next game,
all wearing them like a terrible Council of Evil.

2815
02:51:38,899 --> 02:51:45,643
MARISHA: (laughter) Just the eyes cut out.

2816
02:51:45,643 --> 02:51:51,903
JOE: Not bad. Do you want me to break it down,
piercing and necrotic?

2817
02:51:51,903 --> 02:51:53,653
MATT: No, that's fine.

2818
02:51:53,653 --> 02:51:55,031
JOE: Okay, 29 points.

2819
02:51:55,031 --> 02:51:56,746
MATT: Actually, no, I do need two of those.

2820
02:51:56,746 --> 02:52:03,660
JOE: Okay, then we're going to have 19 piercing
and eight necrotic.

2821
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:05,376
MATT: Okay. Cool.

2822
02:52:05,376 --> 02:52:06,983
JOE: 19 and eight, 27.

2823
02:52:06,983 --> 02:52:10,091
MATT: Make your attack of opportunity, your attack
of opportunity and your attack of opportunity.

2824
02:52:10,091 --> 02:52:12,801
TRAVIS: I'm going to do reckless Trip attack.

2825
02:52:12,801 --> 02:52:24,936
MARISHA: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil! It's fine. It
kind of fucked me. 12.

2826
02:52:24,936 --> 02:52:26,716
MATT: No. (ricochet noise) Off his armor.

2827
02:52:26,716 --> 02:52:27,980
JOE: 30.

2828
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:29,248
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2829
02:52:29,248 --> 02:52:30,121
TRAVIS: 34.

2830
02:52:30,121 --> 02:52:31,444
MATT: Hits, roll damage.

2831
02:52:31,444 --> 02:52:33,719
TRAVIS: He's undead, right?

2832
02:52:33,719 --> 02:52:34,687
MATT: Yes.

2833
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:35,864
JOE: You first, Grog.

2834
02:52:35,864 --> 02:52:37,301
TRAVIS: Oh, no, please.

2835
02:52:37,301 --> 02:52:38,406
JOE: No, no, no, you.

2836
02:52:38,406 --> 02:52:41,063
TRAVIS: No, you were up first, I insist. Arkhan,
please.

2837
02:52:41,063 --> 02:52:43,852
JOE: Yeah, but you did that dynamic jump, it was
really cool.

2838
02:52:43,852 --> 02:52:46,024
MARISHA: Jocks were not this polite in the locker
room.

2839
02:52:46,024 --> 02:52:48,810
SAM: They were to each other.

2840
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:59,837
TRAVIS: Yeah, 17 and then I roll a d8 or I add a
d8.

2841
02:52:59,837 --> 02:53:02,325
MATT: d8 additional damage, yep.

2842
02:53:02,325 --> 02:53:07,193
TRAVIS: It's my first one I've ever rolled. Five.
Shit, what did I say?

2843
02:53:07,193 --> 02:53:08,110
MATT: 17.

2844
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:09,620
TRAVIS Thank you. 22.

2845
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,822
MATT: All right, 22 damage.

2846
02:53:10,822 --> 02:53:13,374
TRAVIS: It's a trip attack.

2847
02:53:13,374 --> 02:53:16,910
MATT: What does it say it does? I'll pull it up.

2848
02:53:16,910 --> 02:53:21,017
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll pull it up. I've got it right
here.

2849
02:53:21,017 --> 02:53:32,621
MATT: Here we go. Okay, a strength saving throw.
That's a natural one, so he's going to use his

2850
02:53:32,621 --> 02:53:38,237
last legendary resistance to resist it. He's out
of legendary resistances now. All right, and

2851
02:53:38,237 --> 02:53:39,705
damage on that one?

2852
02:53:39,705 --> 02:53:50,596
JOE: Just pumped a 1st-level Divine Smite, and
that's going to be 21 plus three is 24, 24--

2853
02:53:50,596 --> 02:53:54,623
TRAVIS: Does his hand turn into a bat with him? Or
does that fall--

2854
02:53:54,623 --> 02:53:56,519
MATT: All of his equipment goes into his form.

2855
02:53:56,519 --> 02:53:58,426
JOE: That's going to be 40 points of damage.

2856
02:53:58,426 --> 02:54:04,508
MATT: As you all slam into the side of this bat
form it shrieks out and then just (flapping)

2857
02:54:04,508 --> 02:54:08,432
it takes off and is going to use its
action to go ahead and go into a dash and continue

2858
02:54:08,432 --> 02:54:09,636
to fly away.

2859
02:54:09,636 --> 02:54:12,754
TALIESIN: I feel like I would be able to get an
attack somewhere in here considering my range if I

2860
02:54:12,754 --> 02:54:14,361
pulled out my big gun.

2861
02:54:14,361 --> 02:54:18,531
MATT: Oh yeah. No, we're coming back to that. He
is at that full speed and that form--

2862
02:54:18,531 --> 02:54:20,556
TRAVIS: Plus we're still in initiative order.

2863
02:54:20,556 --> 02:54:23,889
LIAM: Our reactions come from melee range.

2864
02:54:23,889 --> 02:54:29,515
MATT: Okay. So that ends Sylas' turn. Pike, you're
up.

2865
02:54:29,515 --> 02:54:31,640
ASHLEY: How far away is he?

2866
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:37,583
MATT: He would be about-- Let's say at that flying
speed of the bat, which I have to look up now,

2867
02:54:37,583 --> 02:54:39,214
because that's a thing.

2868
02:54:39,214 --> 02:54:43,200
TALIESIN: How could you not be prepared for--

2869
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:56,195
MATT: I know. What is this bullshit, Matt? Jesus
Christ! The bat's flying speed is 30 feet. So he's

2870
02:54:56,195 --> 02:54:58,490
60 feet away from you guys at an angle that way.

2871
02:54:58,490 --> 02:54:59,703
LAURA: Like here?

2872
02:54:59,703 --> 02:55:04,643
MATT: Yeah. 60 feet up there. All right. Pike,
what are you doing?

2873
02:55:04,643 --> 02:55:07,294
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to--

2874
02:55:07,294 --> 02:55:10,450
MARISHA: I love your commitment to the tickle.

2875
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:19,578
ASHLEY: I'm trying to think of what I should do.
Okay, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt it.

2876
02:55:19,578 --> 02:55:20,983
MATT: Okay.

2877
02:55:20,983 --> 02:55:24,117
LAURA: Guiding Bolt, up the butt! You want to move
forward so you can hit him?

2878
02:55:24,117 --> 02:55:25,025
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2879
02:55:25,025 --> 02:55:31,553
MATT: Guiding Bolt, I believe you have to roll
your attack on that one? Yeah, make a ranged spell

2880
02:55:31,553 --> 02:55:32,652
attack.

2881
02:55:32,652 --> 02:55:40,811
ASHLEY: 18.

2882
02:55:40,811 --> 02:55:42,523
MATT: 18 does not hit.

2883
02:55:42,523 --> 02:55:44,248
ASHLEY: I'm going to use Guided Strike.

2884
02:55:44,248 --> 02:55:45,553
MATT: Okay.

2885
02:55:45,553 --> 02:55:48,407
ASHLEY: Which adds plus ten, so 28.

2886
02:55:48,407 --> 02:55:50,078
MATT: You can use it on yourself, right?

2887
02:55:50,078 --> 02:55:53,975
ASHLEY: Yeah. Guided Strike is for myself, War
God's Blessing is somebody else.

2888
02:55:53,975 --> 02:55:56,284
MATT: That's what it is. Yeah. Go for it. That
hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2889
02:55:56,284 --> 02:56:03,709
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at 3rd level, so that's
four, 6d6.

2890
02:56:03,709 --> 02:56:06,246
LAURA: 6d6?

2891
02:56:06,246 --> 02:56:08,143
MATT: 6d6 radiant damage.

2892
02:56:08,143 --> 02:56:13,483
LAURA: All radiant! That is a really good roll.

2893
02:56:13,483 --> 02:56:15,098
TALIESIN: That looks solid from here.

2894
02:56:15,098 --> 02:56:18,837
SAM: Ashley Johnson. Clutch. Bicoastal Roll.

2895
02:56:18,837 --> 02:56:21,131
MATT: Bicoastal Roll?

2896
02:56:21,131 --> 02:56:28,735
ASHLEY: Okay, 23.

2897
02:56:28,735 --> 02:56:36,953
MATT: 23. (impact) The bat now is shining; the
next attack against it has advantage. End of your turn?

2898
02:56:36,953 --> 02:56:52,561
ASHLEY: Let me see. My bonus actions. Ugh, I don't
want to use that in case. Okay, that's it.

2899
02:56:52,561 --> 02:56:57,396
MATT: All right. End of your turn, going to use
its Legendary Action to move at speed; the bat is

2900
02:56:57,396 --> 02:57:07,760
now 90 feet away. That ends your turn, that brings
us to Scanlan. Oh, the gloomstalkers, actually,

2901
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:11,887
which are no longer stunned. But that's the end of
their turn. End of the gloomstalkers' turn, it's

2902
02:57:11,887 --> 02:57:16,037
going to use another Legendary Action to move
another 30, so it's 120 feet away. Scanlan, you're up.

2903
02:57:16,037 --> 02:57:18,417
LAURA: He's really far away from us now.

2904
02:57:18,417 --> 02:57:19,868
MATT: He's just full sprint.

2905
02:57:19,868 --> 02:57:21,871
LIAM: You said 120 feet away?

2906
02:57:21,871 --> 02:57:22,996
MATT: 120 feet, yeah.

2907
02:57:22,996 --> 02:57:27,371
LAURA: Can you do anything at 120 feet, Scanlan?

2908
02:57:27,371 --> 02:57:29,478
SAM: I can do something. I can do one thing.

2909
02:57:29,478 --> 02:57:31,934
MARISHA: If you guys let me go right now I can
try-- You can do something?

2910
02:57:31,934 --> 02:57:40,830
SAM: Scanlan One will just hold his turn until
those gloomstalkers are in range or until they

2911
02:57:40,830 --> 02:57:45,774
move, and then he'll cast, I don't know, frigging
Wand of Magic Missiles, I don't know.

2912
02:57:45,774 --> 02:57:50,599
MATT: Sure. All right, end of Scanlan's turn, will
use third and final Legendary Action, is now 150

2913
02:57:50,599 --> 02:57:51,858
feet away.

2914
02:57:51,858 --> 02:57:54,050
MARISHA: No! Let me go first!

2915
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:55,872
MATT: We're now at Vax's turn.

2916
02:57:55,872 --> 02:57:57,512
LAURA: Yeah, you can't switch your initiative.

2917
02:57:57,512 --> 02:58:01,564
MARISHA: You can if other people hold. And you
describe--

2918
02:58:01,564 --> 02:58:06,525
MATT: They can hold their action, but then at the
end of their turn, he still gets to do movement.

2919
02:58:06,525 --> 02:58:14,387
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use my movement and
dash, so five, ten, 15... 50, 55, 60, and I'm

2920
02:58:14,387 --> 02:58:17,686
going to paladin attack the gloomstalker up
there.

2921
02:58:17,686 --> 02:58:19,019
MATT: Okay.

2922
02:58:19,019 --> 02:58:32,044
LIAM: First one is great, that is a 33. And the
second one is also pretty good, 25. Do those both hit?

2923
02:58:32,044 --> 02:58:37,159
MATT: They both have an AC of 15.

2924
02:58:37,159 --> 02:58:44,547
LIAM: Okay, shit. Should've called Sharpshooter.
All right, so the first one is one, plus eight is nine--

2925
02:58:44,547 --> 02:58:49,593
TRAVIS: Can he use a legendary resistance on a
grapple?

2926
02:58:49,593 --> 02:58:52,449
MATT: No, because a grapple check is a versus.

2927
02:58:52,449 --> 02:58:59,390
LIAM: Seven, so 11 and seven. Just 11 and seven on
that Gloomstalker.

2928
02:58:59,390 --> 02:59:03,992
MATT: Got it. Ends your turn, Keyleth, you're up.

2929
02:59:03,992 --> 02:59:05,728
MARISHA: How far away is he?

2930
02:59:05,728 --> 02:59:07,951
MATT: 150 feet. from where he was.

2931
02:59:07,951 --> 02:59:15,040
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form, take my action
to cast Earthbind on him, it's a 300-foot range spell.

2932
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:20,645
LAURA: Oh my God. Please, please, please. He's
used up his legendary resistances, right?

2933
02:59:20,645 --> 02:59:21,812
MARISHA: He did.

2934
02:59:21,812 --> 02:59:23,395
MATT: What's the save he has to make?

2935
02:59:23,395 --> 02:59:25,101
MARISHA: Strength versus my spell save.

2936
02:59:25,101 --> 02:59:27,125
TALIESIN: Do you have something because of your
hit?

2937
02:59:27,125 --> 02:59:29,887
MATT: That is 22. 17 plus five.

2938
02:59:29,887 --> 02:59:32,019
MARISHA: 22?!

2939
02:59:32,019 --> 02:59:37,241
MATT: 17 plus five.

2940
02:59:37,241 --> 02:59:39,119
MARISHA: You can't do anything?

2941
02:59:39,119 --> 02:59:40,974
TALIESIN: The last time you hit him, does that
mean--

2942
02:59:40,974 --> 02:59:42,331
LAURA: Advantage!

2943
02:59:42,331 --> 02:59:46,680
MATT: It's a saving throw, it's not an attack.
Yeah, the Earthbind does not take effect on him

2944
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:47,936
unfortunately--

2945
02:59:47,936 --> 02:59:50,763
MARISHA: Can I do it again immediately? Can I try
again?

2946
02:59:50,763 --> 02:59:52,860
MATT: No, it's an action to cast the spell.

2947
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:54,077
MARISHA: Yeah.

2948
02:59:54,077 --> 02:59:55,190
MATT: Sorry.

2949
02:59:55,190 --> 02:59:57,135
MARISHA: I know! Can I wait and--

2950
02:59:57,135 --> 03:00:01,920
MATT: Okay, Scanlan Two? Anything?

2951
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:04,614
SAM: He's 150 feet away?

2952
03:00:04,614 --> 03:00:06,469
MARISHA: He rolled so fucking high!

2953
03:00:06,469 --> 03:00:08,142
LAURA: Can you run 30 feet and then do something?

2954
03:00:08,142 --> 03:00:09,265
MATT: He can run 25 feet.

2955
03:00:09,265 --> 03:00:12,121
SAM: I can run 25 feet and then reach 120 feet.

2956
03:00:12,121 --> 03:00:14,066
MATT: Yeah, you're just under--

2957
03:00:14,066 --> 03:00:15,864
SAM: I'm five feet shy.

2958
03:00:15,864 --> 03:00:18,313
JOE: Wait. I can get you on the back of this thing
and fly it up there.

2959
03:00:18,313 --> 03:00:22,635
LIAM: Yeah, but we can't get out of range of the
ring unless we want to--

2960
03:00:22,635 --> 03:00:25,472
LAURA: I mean, as soon as Sylas isn't there, he's
going to know we're here.

2961
03:00:25,529 --> 03:00:27,735
JOE: So we have to stay within 60 feet. Of each
other.

2962
03:00:27,735 --> 03:00:30,007
LAURA: Or we can all just run.

2963
03:00:30,007 --> 03:00:33,038
MARISHA: If you all hold, I can try again.

2964
03:00:33,038 --> 03:00:35,056
TALIESIN: No, because he's going to keep running.

2965
03:00:35,056 --> 03:00:36,311
LAURA: If we hold, he just keeps moving--

2966
03:00:36,311 --> 03:00:40,500
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's a 300-foot range spell,
and he's only 150 feet away. I don't think he can dash 150 feet.

2967
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:45,770
SAM: He already did 150 getting to your turn so
he'll be able to do another 150--

2968
03:00:45,770 --> 03:00:47,915
MARISHA: But it's a 300-foot range spell.

2969
03:00:47,915 --> 03:00:49,323
LIAM: He'd still be in range--

2970
03:00:49,323 --> 03:00:52,886
TALIESIN: We don't have to hold our turns, we'll
just get back to you.

2971
03:00:52,886 --> 03:00:55,027
MARISHA: Right. That's what I'm saying.

2972
03:00:55,027 --> 03:00:59,752
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, we're fine. I mean, that'll
happen eventually. If it's going to get there.

2973
03:00:59,752 --> 03:01:01,068
LAURA: Whose turn is it?

2974
03:01:01,068 --> 03:01:06,514
SAM: It's Scanlan Two's turn. He's going to bonus
action Bigby's Hand, grapple one of the

2975
03:01:06,514 --> 03:01:08,398
gloomstalkers.

2976
03:01:08,398 --> 03:01:09,776
MATT: Okay.

2977
03:01:09,776 --> 03:01:12,255
SAM: The one we've been working on.

2978
03:01:12,255 --> 03:01:15,353
MATT: All righty. Bigby's Hand punches--

2979
03:01:15,353 --> 03:01:17,942
SAM: Not punches, grapple.

2980
03:01:17,942 --> 03:01:22,666
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this,
they're--

2981
03:01:22,666 --> 03:01:24,158
SAM: They're easily killed.

2982
03:01:24,158 --> 03:01:26,650
MATT: They're pretty easily killed given the
circumstances you guys have, the chase now--

2983
03:01:26,650 --> 03:01:31,290
SAM: Well, do you want to kill them, or save them
for riding on?

2984
03:01:31,290 --> 03:01:32,712
JOE: Bah! I think I'm--

2985
03:01:32,712 --> 03:01:34,663
(laughter)

2986
03:01:34,663 --> 03:01:42,895
JOE: 40 minus three is 37, This one's got 37 hit
points of damage.

2987
03:01:42,895 --> 03:01:46,872
LAURA: Just try to get Sylas.

2988
03:01:46,872 --> 03:01:48,637
JOE: Do what you feel, Scanlan.

2989
03:01:48,637 --> 03:01:50,831
SAM: Well, I'll just hold him for you.

2990
03:01:50,831 --> 03:01:53,977
JOE: Oh, thanks. I appreciate that--

2991
03:01:53,977 --> 03:01:55,963
MATT: Let's say, Grog, you go up there and start.
Anything you want to do--

2992
03:01:55,963 --> 03:01:58,969
TRAVIS: I want to see what the inside of them
looks like.

2993
03:01:58,969 --> 03:02:02,572
MATT: Okay. For the purposes of expediency in
this, so we don't spend time just trudging through

2994
03:02:02,572 --> 03:02:06,118
these things, you guys just hacking at these
gloomstalkers.

2995
03:02:06,118 --> 03:02:07,798
SAM: One we're saving for him.

2996
03:02:07,798 --> 03:02:13,963
MATT: Okay, I will say, to note, that the Control
feature generally is a once-a-day type thing--

2997
03:02:14,039 --> 03:02:15,425
SAM: Ooh. Then never mind, we kill it.

2998
03:02:15,425 --> 03:02:18,170
MATT: Not like it can constantly regenerate to the
next thing.

2999
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:26,464
JOE: Hmm. Let me read my description that you sent
me. All right. No, okay. I'm calling Mike Mearls!

3000
03:02:26,464 --> 03:02:35,170
MARISHA: We get back around everybody! Is he still
fucking here?!

3001
03:02:35,170 --> 03:02:37,343
MATT: We get to Sylas' turn. Sylas dashes twice--

3002
03:02:37,343 --> 03:02:39,116
TALIESIN: Wait, is it Sylas' turn or my turn?

3003
03:02:39,116 --> 03:02:40,976
MATT: Sorry, it's your turn then Sylas', so go
ahead.

3004
03:02:40,976 --> 03:02:45,361
TALIESIN: My turn first. I'm going to take my
advantage shot, because I have advantage because of--

3005
03:02:45,361 --> 03:02:46,815
MATT: With which gun?

3006
03:02:46,815 --> 03:02:47,962
TALIESIN: With Bad News.

3007
03:02:47,962 --> 03:02:48,993
MATT: Okay.

3008
03:02:48,993 --> 03:02:50,219
LAURA: Wait, why didn't I get to go?

3009
03:02:50,219 --> 03:02:51,600
MATT: Oh sorry, you're first. Go for it.

3010
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:54,834
LAURA: Can I run out the door and hop on my broom
and fly as far as I can--

3011
03:02:54,834 --> 03:02:56,000
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no!

3012
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:57,173
JOE: 60!

3013
03:02:57,173 --> 03:02:57,984
TALIESIN: Ring!

3014
03:02:57,984 --> 03:03:01,994
LAURA: Yeah, but I can only get 50 feet away from
you guys. If I come here--

3015
03:03:01,994 --> 03:03:07,327
MATT: As soon as you go around that side, you're
starting to get close. Up to you. You have Scanlan

3016
03:03:07,327 --> 03:03:09,309
all the way over there. You barely have Scanlan in
your--

3017
03:03:09,309 --> 03:03:13,706
LAURA: So I can't leave. So I'm at the bottom of
the stairs. If I run up the stairs and broom it

3018
03:03:13,706 --> 03:03:15,869
from here, how far would I get?

3019
03:03:15,869 --> 03:03:19,755
MATT: Ten feet out the window.

3020
03:03:19,755 --> 03:03:28,256
LAURA: Ten feet out the window and he's 150 and
I'm-- my shot is what, but with Sharpshooter-- no,

3021
03:03:28,256 --> 03:03:29,320
that's different.

3022
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:34,188
LIAM: Doesn't affect range, it just affects your
chances.

3023
03:03:34,188 --> 03:03:38,393
LAURA: Shit! Wait, let me look at Fenthras. I'm
just hoping there's something that says it's 300 feet!

3024
03:03:38,393 --> 03:03:40,326
MATT: Fenthras does not change your range.

3025
03:03:40,326 --> 03:03:44,779
LAURA: (nervous laughter) Okay then, it's only
120-foot range, right? With a longbow?

3026
03:03:44,779 --> 03:03:52,484
MATT: Well, the way longbows work is you have an
inner range and an outer range, so if he's

3027
03:03:52,484 --> 03:03:53,641
beyond--

3028
03:03:53,641 --> 03:03:55,561
TALIESIN: But if you're Sharpshooter the outer
range is the inner range.

3029
03:03:55,561 --> 03:03:56,715
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

3030
03:03:56,715 --> 03:03:59,943
MATT: Yeah, your max is 600.

3031
03:03:59,943 --> 03:04:01,676
LAURA: My max is 600 fucking feet?

3032
03:04:01,676 --> 03:04:03,808
MATT: Yep.

3033
03:04:03,808 --> 03:04:05,324
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, so you just walk up and take a
shot.

3034
03:04:05,324 --> 03:04:10,574
LAURA: Okay then, I'm going to walk up to the
window and I'm going to try to cast Bramble Shot

3035
03:04:10,574 --> 03:04:11,791
on him.

3036
03:04:11,791 --> 03:04:14,613
TALIESIN: With advantage!

3037
03:04:14,613 --> 03:04:16,316
LAURA: With advantage?

3038
03:04:16,316 --> 03:04:17,388
SAM: It's an attack.

3039
03:04:17,388 --> 03:04:18,287
ASHLEY: Because of--

3040
03:04:18,287 --> 03:04:19,794
MATT: Guiding Bolt. Go for it.

3041
03:04:19,794 --> 03:04:21,859
TALIESIN: Much better!

3042
03:04:21,859 --> 03:04:23,449
JOE: Holy freaking half-elf!

3043
03:04:23,449 --> 03:04:28,666
LAURA: 20.

3044
03:04:28,666 --> 03:04:30,009
MATT: 20 just hits.

3045
03:04:30,009 --> 03:04:33,246
(cheering)

3046
03:04:33,246 --> 03:04:36,825
MARISHA: Get him down!

3047
03:04:36,825 --> 03:04:51,060
LAURA: Oh my God. Okay, so 12, that's 18 plus
4d8.

3048
03:04:51,060 --> 03:04:52,930
LIAM: Sharpshooter doesn't double the distance?

3049
03:04:52,930 --> 03:04:56,014
MATT: No, but you have the two different ranges.
Because your range is technically 30 to 60, but

3050
03:04:56,014 --> 03:04:58,540
you can go the full 60 without taking disadvantage
after 30 feet.

3051
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:00,929
LIAM: So it's at disadvantage normally?

3052
03:05:00,929 --> 03:05:04,471
MATT: No disadvantage as a Sharpshooter. It's a
crazy feat.

3053
03:05:04,471 --> 03:05:06,175
LAURA: 43.

3054
03:05:06,175 --> 03:05:08,442
MATT: 43 points of damage.

3055
03:05:08,442 --> 03:05:13,174
LAURA: And he has to make a strength save of DC 17
or be restrained.

3056
03:05:13,174 --> 03:05:17,439
MATT: That is a nine plus five, that is a 14.

3057
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:19,021
(cheering)

3058
03:05:19,021 --> 03:05:25,105
MATT: As the arrow hits the bat, you watch as the
arrow bursts into a sudden swarming of bramble

3059
03:05:25,105 --> 03:05:29,787
vines. They wrap around him and the bat (small
impact).

3060
03:05:29,787 --> 03:05:32,969
LAURA: And does he take bludgeoning damage from
hitting the ground?

3061
03:05:32,969 --> 03:05:38,691
MATT: He does take a little bit. He's about 80
feet up from there, because he's going at an

3062
03:05:38,691 --> 03:05:41,201
angle, so he takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage.

3063
03:05:41,201 --> 03:05:49,330
SAM: Oh my God! That was the most sniper thing
you've ever done!

3064
03:05:49,330 --> 03:05:50,958
LAURA: That was pretty awesome!

3065
03:05:50,958 --> 03:06:04,091
MATT: And with that, you watch as the bat form
(poof) dissipates. The brambles fall weak and open.

3066
03:06:04,091 --> 03:06:06,011
SAM: Is he there?

3067
03:06:06,011 --> 03:06:07,944
MATT: Make a perception check.

3068
03:06:07,944 --> 03:06:10,305
LAURA: Can I see him?

3069
03:06:10,305 --> 03:06:12,354
MATT: Make a perception check.

3070
03:06:12,354 --> 03:06:14,760
SAM: No bueno.

3071
03:06:14,760 --> 03:06:16,741
LIAM: I got 26 for Vax.

3072
03:06:16,741 --> 03:06:23,205
MATT: You see a misty cloud in the space where
Sylas was.

3073
03:06:23,205 --> 03:06:30,991
LAURA: 34. Misty cloud! How did we fight him
before? Sunlight destroyed him before?

3074
03:06:30,991 --> 03:06:32,212
SAM: Radiant something, right?

3075
03:06:32,212 --> 03:06:34,007
LAURA: Sunbeam destroyed him before.

3076
03:06:34,007 --> 03:06:35,476
TRAVIS: When he was in the gaseous form.

3077
03:06:35,476 --> 03:06:39,420
LAURA: Now he's in the gaseous form. Okay, so I
rolled a 34.

3078
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:44,049
TALIESIN: I rolled huge. 28.

3079
03:06:44,049 --> 03:06:46,244
MATT: 28? To what?

3080
03:06:46,244 --> 03:06:47,254
TALIESIN: Perception.

3081
03:06:47,254 --> 03:06:48,792
MATT: Yeah, you see the mist.

3082
03:06:48,792 --> 03:06:49,905
TALIESIN: How far away is he?

3083
03:06:49,905 --> 03:06:53,854
LAURA: He's 150 feet away.

3084
03:06:53,854 --> 03:06:57,277
LIAM: He didn't get a chance to go.

3085
03:06:57,277 --> 03:07:00,577
LAURA: He's 150 feet away from us.

3086
03:07:00,577 --> 03:07:02,112
MATT: Yeah.

3087
03:07:02,112 --> 03:07:09,852
LAURA: So as a group we can all try to move
forward, but as we get closer to him--

3088
03:07:09,852 --> 03:07:14,062
TALIESIN: You've got what it takes. What's the
distance on that thing?

3089
03:07:14,062 --> 03:07:18,557
LAURA: What's the Daylight casting distance? Can
you run forward and get close enough?

3090
03:07:18,557 --> 03:07:24,524
MARISHA: You guys aren't going to want to hear
this, I can run forward and Sunburst him at 150

3091
03:07:24,524 --> 03:07:26,471
feet away but it's going to burn my 8th-level
spell.

3092
03:07:26,471 --> 03:07:27,838
SAM: Don't do that.

3093
03:07:27,838 --> 03:07:37,674
MARISHA: I have Sunbeam, which is a 6th-level
spell at 60-foot away. No, I dropped my form.

3094
03:07:37,674 --> 03:07:38,746
MATT: Yep.

3095
03:07:38,746 --> 03:07:40,798
TALIESIN: What if you got on a mount?

3096
03:07:40,798 --> 03:07:45,027
SAM: Just to get there as fast as you can.

3097
03:07:45,027 --> 03:07:46,996
JOE: But we can't get outside of the 60-foot
bubble.

3098
03:07:46,996 --> 03:07:50,502
TALIESIN: We can all move together and he will not
be able to move at high speed as a mist.

3099
03:07:50,502 --> 03:07:51,579
LAURA: Hopefully.

3100
03:07:51,579 --> 03:07:56,609
MARISHA: Can I scoop up Vex and dash 60 feet ahead
and Sunbeam him for another 60 feet?

3101
03:07:56,609 --> 03:08:01,285
MATT: Dash as your action.

3102
03:08:01,285 --> 03:08:02,528
TALIESIN: And we have to stay together.

3103
03:08:02,528 --> 03:08:03,670
LAURA: We have to stay together.

3104
03:08:03,670 --> 03:08:06,745
JOE: Well, you're in the gray. No. Where are you?

3105
03:08:06,745 --> 03:08:09,592
MARISHA: I'm green.

3106
03:08:09,592 --> 03:08:15,981
LAURA: I'm technically right here, right now. I'm
on the second level. Next to Pike.

3107
03:08:15,981 --> 03:08:17,371
JOE: And Bigby's is--

3108
03:08:17,371 --> 03:08:19,381
SAM: Is it your turn Keyleth?

3109
03:08:19,381 --> 03:08:21,427
MARISHA: Yeah, whose turn is it?

3110
03:08:21,427 --> 03:08:23,510
MATT: It's finishing Vex's.

3111
03:08:23,510 --> 03:08:25,114
LAURA: No, it's Percy's turn.

3112
03:08:25,114 --> 03:08:26,875
MATT: Okay, so Percy. Your turn.

3113
03:08:26,875 --> 03:08:28,930
LAURA: You could technically try to sh-- Oh yeah,
mist form.

3114
03:08:28,930 --> 03:08:32,618
(laughter)

3115
03:08:32,618 --> 03:08:34,999
JOE: Was that a Jenga?

3116
03:08:34,999 --> 03:08:48,050
TALIESIN: Wait. I have a weird thing I'm going to
try and do-- No, the thing I need to do, I need to

3117
03:08:48,050 --> 03:08:49,104
get within 30 feet.

3118
03:08:49,104 --> 03:08:52,560
LAURA: Well, you can get within 60 feet of me so
just move toward--

3119
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:57,763
TALIESIN: I'm going to move to the edge of where
I'm capable of moving right now at my speed. I'm

3120
03:08:57,763 --> 03:09:04,695
going to signal everybody and say move as a group.
So we're going to try to sync our movements.

3121
03:09:04,695 --> 03:09:19,503
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purposes of
this, the mist travels and vanishes from sight by

3122
03:09:19,503 --> 03:09:25,325
the time you are able to catch up to it to get it
to a place where you can destroy it. Delilah

3123
03:09:25,325 --> 03:09:34,263
Briarwood has been destroyed, seemingly for the
last time. Sylas has been driven to wherever he

3124
03:09:34,263 --> 03:09:38,277
needs to recover.

3125
03:09:38,277 --> 03:09:39,937
LAURA: Does it take him a long time?

3126
03:09:39,937 --> 03:09:41,527
SAM: Vecna gives up.

3127
03:09:41,527 --> 03:09:42,807
JOE: Can I say one thing right now?

3128
03:09:42,807 --> 03:09:44,116
MATT: Yes.

3129
03:09:44,116 --> 03:09:57,861
JOE: As we were moving in the bubble, I cast
Animate Dead on Delilah and I raise her.

3130
03:09:57,861 --> 03:10:01,295
TALIESIN: You're doing what?

3131
03:10:01,295 --> 03:10:03,501
SAM: We're fighting her again!

3132
03:10:03,501 --> 03:10:10,806
MATT: As you look out, you can see the mist, and
the mist vanishes, and you can see now, looking

3133
03:10:10,806 --> 03:10:18,645
up, dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers have all
turned to see this out-in-the-open action that's

3134
03:10:18,645 --> 03:10:25,578
now taking place in the space around you. You are
all out, not being stealthy, firing and shooting

3135
03:10:25,578 --> 03:10:31,820
out into the air, and you see now, clusters of
these things heading in your direction. As you

3136
03:10:31,820 --> 03:10:39,206
turn and look to the side, you watch as Delilah's
body gets up from the ground.

3137
03:10:39,206 --> 03:10:42,467
JOE: Rise, and kneel before your master!

3138
03:10:42,467 --> 03:10:47,516
MATT: As the shambling corpse of Delilah falls to
her knees before Arkhan--

3139
03:10:47,516 --> 03:10:51,905
JOE: Oathbreaker, baby!

3140
03:10:51,905 --> 03:11:04,044
MATT: As the realization begins of what is coming
at you. Two you could handle, maybe. There's a lot

3141
03:11:04,044 --> 03:11:08,120
in your direction. You have revealed your
position, the wall was already destroyed and

3142
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:15,352
everything is swarming in your direction. As you
all begin to turn around, you hear this deafening

3143
03:11:15,352 --> 03:11:25,403
roar from the sky above you. You glance up to see
a flash of brass light as Devo'ssa comes swooping

3144
03:11:25,403 --> 03:11:35,464
into the barrier. Behind, a hundred or more Wyvern
Riders, risen from Vasselheim to join the rest of

3145
03:11:35,464 --> 03:11:44,067
the brigade come swarming in and collide with the
gloomstalkers. You now see a frantic dog-fight

3146
03:11:44,067 --> 03:11:48,419
cluster as hundreds of one and hundreds of the
other begin slamming into each other, tearing each

3147
03:11:48,419 --> 03:11:54,698
other apart. You see blades swing, you see arrows
going flying and Devo'ssa begins to do sweeping

3148
03:11:54,698 --> 03:11:59,759
rounds, back and forth across the sky. You realise
if there is a moment to move with the distraction,

3149
03:11:59,759 --> 03:12:01,343
it's now.

3150
03:12:01,343 --> 03:12:03,609
JOE: I load Delilah on the back.

3151
03:12:03,609 --> 03:12:07,199
TALIESIN: I grab her wand.

3152
03:12:07,199 --> 03:12:11,168
MARISHA: And her holy symbol that fell to the
ground.

3153
03:12:11,168 --> 03:12:13,115
LAURA: Whatever that sparking thing was.

3154
03:12:13,115 --> 03:12:16,534
MATT: The glowing sparkle light in it is inert
now.

3155
03:12:16,534 --> 03:12:18,059
MARISHA: Is what? Inert?

3156
03:12:18,059 --> 03:12:21,752
TALIESIN: It was the controller. So we have it.

3157
03:12:21,752 --> 03:12:23,888
LAURA: We book it towards the tower. Right?

3158
03:12:23,888 --> 03:12:27,857
MATT: You guys begin bolting your way towards
Entropis with its large funnel-like cloud

3159
03:12:27,857 --> 03:12:32,228
encircling the top of its spire. And we're going
to take a break.

3160
03:12:32,228 --> 03:12:37,448
(cheering)

3161
03:12:37,448 --> 03:12:39,754
TRAVIS: Y'all, we recruited dead Delilah!

3162
03:12:39,754 --> 03:12:42,368
JOE: I want to find this dude!

3163
03:12:42,368 --> 03:12:50,528
MARISHA: What a dick!

3164
03:12:50,528 --> 03:12:55,544
MATT: We're going to take a quick break, because
we want to probably push to 11 tonight and then

3165
03:12:55,544 --> 03:13:00,750
we're going to leave, so make a quick restroom
break, fast as we can, come back. See you guys

3166
03:13:00,750 --> 03:13:01,854
here in just a minute.

3167
03:13:01,854 --> 03:13:03,336
LAURA: At the break we're giving away--

3168
03:13:03,336 --> 03:13:05,979
MARISHA: We're giving away things.

3169
03:13:05,979 --> 03:13:07,250
TALIESIN: So many things!

3170
03:13:07,250 --> 03:13:08,408
JOE: Jocks Machina!

3171
03:13:08,408 --> 03:13:10,397
MARISHA: Yeah, actually, Max or Ryan, is there
stipulations on the shirt?

3172
03:13:10,397 --> 03:13:12,399
TALIESIN: Nope.

3173
03:13:12,399 --> 03:13:13,827
MARISHA: We'll figure it out!

3174
03:13:13,827 --> 03:13:16,200
JOE: Hey Travis, go put this on.

3175
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:19,285
MATT: Okay guys, we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

3176
03:13:19,285 --> 03:13:21,029
TALIESIN: Take the wrapper off! That's weird!

3177
03:13:21,029 --> 03:35:07,003
[break]

3178
03:35:07,104 --> 03:35:10,763
MATT: Welcome back. A little longer than I
anticipated, but that's fine. We're going to jump

3179
03:35:10,763 --> 03:35:14,968
in here, but before we do that, the winners for
the Wyrmwood box, we have Zabando is the winner.

3180
03:35:14,968 --> 03:35:27,468
For the Jocks Machina shirt, we have Alcyon299.
Congratulations! You get to join the very

3181
03:35:27,468 --> 03:35:28,733
exclusive Jocks Machina club.

3182
03:35:28,733 --> 03:35:30,162
TRAVIS: Testosterone poncho.

3183
03:35:30,162 --> 03:35:33,102
JOE: Only five of these. The other's my trainer
Ron, who plays another goliath, and my brother

3184
03:35:33,102 --> 03:35:37,803
Nick, who plays an elf ranger who was incinerated
by the fucking death knight!

3185
03:35:37,803 --> 03:35:44,852
MATT: So. Bringing it back in. As you guys are
charging your way toward Entropis, running through

3186
03:35:44,852 --> 03:35:52,392
the streets, you do the best you can to dodge in
and out of any sort of things that might catch

3187
03:35:52,392 --> 03:35:57,316
your attention street-side. You see most of the
undead and various cultists have been filtering

3188
03:35:57,420 --> 03:36:01,554
down beneath the city a while back, and you're not
entirely certain where they are at the moment. The

3189
03:36:01,554 --> 03:36:06,323
few dregs there are around there, you guys easily
enough dodge around.

3190
03:36:06,323 --> 03:36:13,482
Pushing forward, you see the Spire of Entropis
growing taller and taller, the closer and closer

3191
03:36:13,482 --> 03:36:20,436
you get to it. As soon as you get to the base of
the spire, you look up and you can see the broken

3192
03:36:20,436 --> 03:36:27,190
seams of the once-toppled tower, now held together
by the network of glowing, magical threads, like

3193
03:36:27,190 --> 03:36:34,329
arcane veins, wrapping the tower and lending an
unsettling, organic nature to its visage. The

3194
03:36:34,329 --> 03:36:40,434
exterior still stands, windowless, like an obelisk
of tyranny looming over the entirety of the city.

3195
03:36:40,434 --> 03:36:48,060
The apex, of course, is now obscured by shadow and
cloud, this slow-spinning tornado of twilight

3196
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:55,785
darkness entwining the top, blocking visibility,
and possibly entry, at the top. Numerous

3197
03:36:55,785 --> 03:37:01,020
gloomstalkers encircle the higher level, not
currently engaging in the main fray, which is

3198
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:07,125
chaos all around. You see more emerging from this
cloud, almost seemingly creating them.

3199
03:37:07,125 --> 03:37:18,888
The large front doors of the tower appear somewhat
ajar and open. There is one rot behemoth currently

3200
03:37:18,888 --> 03:37:25,124
standing in front of this door. Vox Machina, what
do you want to do?

3201
03:37:25,124 --> 03:37:31,103
TRAVIS: I don't want to overthink this, but I feel
like the sword said that it wanted to cut the webs

3202
03:37:31,103 --> 03:37:36,539
of Vecna. Can I just cut the tower down?

3203
03:37:36,539 --> 03:37:39,408
LAURA: I don't know if that's--

3204
03:37:39,408 --> 03:37:41,423
TRAVIS: I take your laugh as a sign of--

3205
03:37:41,423 --> 03:37:46,153
SAM: I don't know if you can cut the whole tower
down. They'll probably try to stop you. Don't you think?

3206
03:37:46,153 --> 03:37:48,357
ASHLEY: You could certainly try.

3207
03:37:48,357 --> 03:37:49,542
TRAVIS: I could, couldn't I?

3208
03:37:49,542 --> 03:37:50,676
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3209
03:37:50,676 --> 03:37:51,758
TRAVIS: Perhaps not.

3210
03:37:51,758 --> 03:38:00,077
LAURA: I feel like, do we see any other doors,
like, secret doors, maybe?

3211
03:38:00,077 --> 03:38:01,627
SAM: Do we see invisible doors?

3212
03:38:01,627 --> 03:38:06,821
MATT: Perception, glancing around, you don't see
anything. It looks like this is <i>the</i> door,

3213
03:38:06,821 --> 03:38:09,956
entrance, to it. You could make an investigation
check, but you'd have to get up against the wall

3214
03:38:09,956 --> 03:38:11,530
and carefully check it.

3215
03:38:11,530 --> 03:38:14,300
LAURA: Can I do that without letting the rot
behemoth see me?

3216
03:38:14,300 --> 03:38:17,308
MATT: You can certainly try.

3217
03:38:17,308 --> 03:38:20,233
TRAVIS: That's a big fat no!

3218
03:38:20,233 --> 03:38:22,882
MATT: You can certainly try. It's not a no.

3219
03:38:22,882 --> 03:38:27,038
LIAM: But we're directly in front of the door a
ways back? How far back?

3220
03:38:27,038 --> 03:38:30,917
MATT: You're about 40 feet away from it, off to
the side, glancing over where you can see the rot

3221
03:38:30,917 --> 03:38:32,652
behemoth looming in the archway.

3222
03:38:32,652 --> 03:38:35,862
LAURA: We didn't really think about how we were
getting up the tower, did we?

3223
03:38:35,862 --> 03:38:42,636
JOE: Here's a possibility. I have a gloomstalker
and I have Delilah. I put her on the back of this

3224
03:38:42,636 --> 03:38:45,073
thing and fly it up there, maybe this thing moves
out of the way.

3225
03:38:45,073 --> 03:38:48,534
LAURA: Maybe the rot behemoth moves?

3226
03:38:48,534 --> 03:38:49,717
JOE: I'm just saying.

3227
03:38:49,717 --> 03:38:52,869
SAM: Can she talk? Can you make her talk?

3228
03:38:52,869 --> 03:38:56,818
JOE: I don't think I can puppet her. I can tell
her to do commands.

3229
03:38:56,818 --> 03:38:58,421
LAURA: Can you tell her to talk?

3230
03:38:58,421 --> 03:39:01,789
JOE: She'll understand what I'm saying, but I
don't think she can--

3231
03:39:01,789 --> 03:39:08,700
MATT: By the way, as you've made this journey
forward and Delilah's been shambling behind, you

3232
03:39:08,700 --> 03:39:13,461
know, sitting behind you, this strange pain has
been hitting you in the back of your shoulders.

3233
03:39:13,461 --> 03:39:20,341
You glance back and look at the corpse of Delilah
behind you as a rapidly growing tree is protruding

3234
03:39:20,341 --> 03:39:24,845
and growing out of the chest of the corpse, and is
now setting weight off of the top of the

3235
03:39:24,845 --> 03:39:27,832
gloomstalker as it's trying to flutter up behind
the party.

3236
03:39:27,832 --> 03:39:31,872
LAURA: Sorry, sorry, that's a thing.

3237
03:39:31,872 --> 03:39:35,960
JOE: Can I Cleansing Touch and end one spell?

3238
03:39:35,960 --> 03:39:46,926
MATT: It's less of a spell effect and more of a
divine seed that was placed inside her body when

3239
03:39:46,926 --> 03:39:48,669
she was slain by the Vestige, Fenthras.

3240
03:39:48,669 --> 03:39:51,612
LAURA: I placed my seed inside of her.

3241
03:39:51,612 --> 03:39:52,795
TALIESIN: And it quickened.

3242
03:39:52,795 --> 03:39:54,167
MATT: Don't make it weird.

3243
03:39:54,167 --> 03:39:56,422
LAURA: I make everything weird, Matt.

3244
03:39:56,422 --> 03:39:59,635
JOE: I'm not going to further question you about
that.

3245
03:39:59,635 --> 03:40:00,851
SAM: You knocked her up.

3246
03:40:00,851 --> 03:40:05,993
JOE: Yeah, okay, must be an elf thing. That's
interesting. Very interesting, okay, great.

3247
03:40:05,993 --> 03:40:11,335
SAM: Maybe they'll think that it's just a fashion
thing, and they'll let her through.

3248
03:40:11,335 --> 03:40:15,886
MATT: It's still growing, and it's now protruding
about four feet from her chest. The body is now

3249
03:40:15,886 --> 03:40:18,005
starting to get a little top-heavy.

3250
03:40:18,005 --> 03:40:21,471
LAURA: Just chop the tree down! It's a thin tree.

3251
03:40:21,471 --> 03:40:25,052
MATT: Yeah, it's not very thick. It's maybe
about-- Okay, so you take a couple hacks at it and

3252
03:40:25,052 --> 03:40:28,253
eventually you manage to cut away the tree. Now
there's a trunk that's now stopped growing, about

3253
03:40:28,253 --> 03:40:34,266
a foot out of Delilah's chest, with roots that
have taken root up into the shoulders and the chest.

3254
03:40:34,266 --> 03:40:37,215
LAURA: That's sick. It's like she's got a built-in
shield now.

3255
03:40:37,215 --> 03:40:40,532
TRAVIS: Can I take one of the fancy robes that
remains in the Bag of Holding and drape it over

3256
03:40:40,532 --> 03:40:44,194
the trunk coming out of her chest, so it's a
little more hidden?

3257
03:40:44,194 --> 03:40:45,283
MATT: Sure.

3258
03:40:45,283 --> 03:40:47,352
LAURA: Now it looks like she's pregnant!

3259
03:40:47,352 --> 03:40:52,422
SAM: I need a house. Can I take her branches and
make one?

3260
03:40:52,422 --> 03:40:54,514
MATT: A house?

3261
03:40:54,514 --> 03:40:57,259
SAM: Oh, it's The Giving Tree.

3262
03:40:57,259 --> 03:40:58,931
(groaning)

3263
03:40:58,931 --> 03:40:59,764
LAURA: That's terrible.

3264
03:40:59,764 --> 03:41:01,052
(something clanks on the floor)

3265
03:41:01,052 --> 03:41:02,183
LAURA: Oh! What was that?

3266
03:41:02,183 --> 03:41:07,204
MATT: You have this rot behemoth at the entryway.
What are you guys doing?

3267
03:41:07,204 --> 03:41:10,319
LIAM: Well, our options are somehow flying up or
going in the front door.

3268
03:41:10,319 --> 03:41:16,428
LAURA: Do we fly up, or do we go inside and up the
tower? I'm sure there's no traps or horrible

3269
03:41:16,428 --> 03:41:18,600
things on the inside of it.

3270
03:41:18,600 --> 03:41:23,386
MARISHA: Last time, Pike and I took it down with a
couple of Earthquake spells.

3271
03:41:23,386 --> 03:41:25,828
TALIESIN: But that didn't help nearly as much as
we thought it would.

3272
03:41:25,828 --> 03:41:31,616
MARISHA: I mean, we didn't have to go up the damn
thing, so maybe check yourself before you say things.

3273
03:41:31,616 --> 03:41:34,031
SAM: Let's just charge in. This is a fricking
giant, right? We've killed giants.

3274
03:41:34,031 --> 03:41:37,509
TRAVIS: Behemoth. Is it dead? Undead?

3275
03:41:37,509 --> 03:41:38,925
MATT: The rot behemoth? It's undead.

3276
03:41:38,925 --> 03:41:41,393
JOE: It's undead? How big is a rot behemoth?

3277
03:41:41,393 --> 03:41:48,945
MATT: The rot behemoth is about 12 feet tall or
so. Just a mass of stitched-together undead flesh.

3278
03:41:48,945 --> 03:41:51,723
JOE: Medium, or large?

3279
03:41:51,723 --> 03:41:52,765
MATT: Large.

3280
03:41:52,765 --> 03:41:56,644
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. Can I borrow some of
that infinite rope?

3281
03:41:56,644 --> 03:41:57,626
LAURA: Of course.

3282
03:41:57,626 --> 03:42:01,778
TALIESIN: All right. I'm taking the infinite rope,
and I'm tying it around my little gem that I have.

3283
03:42:01,778 --> 03:42:05,796
LAURA: The little blue gem?

3284
03:42:05,796 --> 03:42:07,740
TALIESIN: My little glowing gem.

3285
03:42:07,740 --> 03:42:11,731
MARISHA: Are you going to do that $20 bill trick
in New York City, thing?

3286
03:42:11,731 --> 03:42:17,310
TALIESIN: More or less. Are we all agreed?

3287
03:42:17,310 --> 03:42:19,559
LAURA: I love it, I love it!

3288
03:42:19,559 --> 03:42:21,172
TRAVIS: If it doesn't work, we kill it.

3289
03:42:21,172 --> 03:42:23,613
LAURA: Yeah, we'll drag it out of the doorway so
we can kill it!

3290
03:42:23,613 --> 03:42:28,478
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to make it move away,
and then once we're in I'm going to yank--

3291
03:42:28,478 --> 03:42:33,944
LIAM: I used to do this with string and a G.I. Joe
for my cat when I was a kid. She loved it. I'm

3292
03:42:33,944 --> 03:42:35,669
sure the rot behemoth will too.

3293
03:42:35,669 --> 03:42:39,504
MATT: Okay, so. You take the pulse stone, you tie
it around--

3294
03:42:39,504 --> 03:42:46,544
TALIESIN: I tie it around in a monkey fist knot. I
toss it about 20 feet away. I'm going to give it a

3295
03:42:46,544 --> 03:42:53,893
throw. I'm going to throw it about 20 feet away
from the-- We're all in agreement of this plan?

3296
03:42:53,893 --> 03:42:55,320
SAM: This is the best plan.

3297
03:42:55,320 --> 03:42:59,365
LIAM: Wait, one second. Do we want to lure it into
a house and all of us be waiting to gank the shit

3298
03:42:59,365 --> 03:43:00,886
out of it?

3299
03:43:00,886 --> 03:43:05,042
TALIESIN: Well, technically, wait, hold on.

3300
03:43:05,042 --> 03:43:12,979
MATT: You see a flash and a flare in the sky above
you. You see a cluster of gloomstalkers immolated

3301
03:43:12,979 --> 03:43:17,611
by a burst of flame breath from Devo'ssa, who's
now up in the stratosphere. At this same time, you

3302
03:43:17,611 --> 03:43:23,541
see about a dozen or so wyvern riders go riding
into this slow, spinning storm and get

3303
03:43:23,541 --> 03:43:26,657
disintegrated into pieces.

3304
03:43:26,657 --> 03:43:31,452
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to throw the gem,
then, past the stone giant, into the room. Just a

3305
03:43:31,452 --> 03:43:33,649
little bit so that anything in the room--

3306
03:43:33,649 --> 03:43:35,946
MATT: Make a strength check for me. That's a bit
of a lob.

3307
03:43:35,946 --> 03:43:39,008
TALIESIN: Okay. Nine?

3308
03:43:39,008 --> 03:43:44,113
MATT: It makes it about the 20 feet you intended
to. (clattering)

3309
03:43:44,113 --> 03:43:47,543
LAURA: Pull it back and we'll have one of the-- I
mean, not that you're not strong and very--

3310
03:43:47,543 --> 03:43:49,463
MATT: So what was the range on this Pulse Stone?

3311
03:43:49,463 --> 03:43:52,780
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

3312
03:43:52,780 --> 03:43:54,671
MATT: Okay, it is within range to affect the rot
behemoth.

3313
03:43:54,671 --> 03:43:57,947
TALIESIN: Okay. I have to roll, though. I have to
do a roll to see if it survived the throw.

3314
03:43:57,947 --> 03:43:59,218
MATT: That's true, yeah.

3315
03:43:59,218 --> 03:44:03,968
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's fine.

3316
03:44:03,968 --> 03:44:08,573
MATT: Tink, tink! It's a will save for the rot
behemoth.

3317
03:44:08,573 --> 03:44:11,746
TALIESIN: DC 15.

3318
03:44:11,746 --> 03:44:19,666
MATT: Wisdom? That's a two. No. You guys watch as
the rot behemoth, the stone, (clattering), its

3319
03:44:19,666 --> 03:44:29,785
metal-armored face and glowing coal eyes turn
(heavy footsteps) and walks over to the gem and

3320
03:44:29,785 --> 03:44:31,542
stares at it.

3321
03:44:31,542 --> 03:44:37,515
TALIESIN: Let's all go in, shall we? And I'm going
to walk around it and stealth in.

3322
03:44:37,515 --> 03:44:43,164
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace is still fucking up,
if it's been less than an hour.

3323
03:44:43,164 --> 03:44:46,760
MATT: Make a concentration check for me, real
fast. Make a constitution saving throw.

3324
03:44:46,760 --> 03:44:49,535
LIAM: We just watched the wyverns get obliterated
trying to fly into the swirl at the top.

3325
03:44:49,535 --> 03:44:52,803
LAURA: I got 18.

3326
03:44:52,803 --> 03:44:56,521
MATT: Okay, you maintain the concentration.
Referring to the blast from the skeletal dragon,

3327
03:44:56,521 --> 03:45:01,332
earlier on. All right. So. Did you guys all roll
stealth?

3328
03:45:01,417 --> 03:45:03,263
SAM: Stealth? Oh shit.

3329
03:45:03,263 --> 03:45:05,009
LAURA: Plus ten!

3330
03:45:05,009 --> 03:45:06,230
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3331
03:45:06,230 --> 03:45:07,741
MARISHA: Wait, stealth?

3332
03:45:07,741 --> 03:45:10,249
SAM: I rolled a two and a two, so that's 15 and
15.

3333
03:45:10,249 --> 03:45:15,881
JOE: How do I do this on this gloomstalker, with
the zombie? How does this work?

3334
03:45:15,881 --> 03:45:29,685
MATT: Zombie's not stealthed, but it is undead.
Gloomstalker, it's hard to be stealthed, that

3335
03:45:29,685 --> 03:45:31,049
gloomstalker, right now.

3336
03:45:31,049 --> 03:45:32,527
SAM: We're going inside, we don't need it
anymore!

3337
03:45:32,527 --> 03:45:33,606
JOE: Want me to leave it?

3338
03:45:33,606 --> 03:45:38,203
SAM: I mean, what are you going to do with a
flying thing in a narrow stairway? We've seen

3339
03:45:38,203 --> 03:45:41,675
inside, we scryed inside. It's a very narrow
stairway going up.

3340
03:45:41,675 --> 03:45:46,030
LAURA: Can you have him climb up the side of the
tower and meet you up top?

3341
03:45:46,030 --> 03:45:52,189
SAM: Oh yeah, meet us up top? (under his breath)
He ain't going to survive that.

3342
03:45:52,189 --> 03:45:54,028
LAURA: Well, we can try it though.

3343
03:45:54,028 --> 03:45:55,004
TRAVIS: He might.

3344
03:45:55,004 --> 03:45:56,301
JOE: Yeah, I think that would work.

3345
03:45:56,301 --> 03:45:57,559
MATT: Okay, you can do that.

3346
03:45:57,559 --> 03:45:58,703
JOE: I hate it when you do that!

3347
03:45:58,703 --> 03:46:02,030
LIAM: I mean, I love it, but I hate it.

3348
03:46:02,030 --> 03:46:07,559
TALIESIN: Also, double checking-- grit is a reset
after combat, not a reset after a short rest?

3349
03:46:07,559 --> 03:46:09,264
MATT: No, it's a short rest.

3350
03:46:09,264 --> 03:46:10,450
TALIESIN: Short rest? Okay, just checking.

3351
03:46:10,450 --> 03:46:15,103
JOE: I have the wreath back on my neck, correct?
Because that's how it works, I put it back on my

3352
03:46:15,103 --> 03:46:16,702
neck once we're attuned?

3353
03:46:16,702 --> 03:46:21,457
MATT: Yeah, you put it back on your neck once
you've-- correct.

3354
03:46:21,457 --> 03:46:23,819
JOE: Okay. They, meet us at the top!

3355
03:46:23,819 --> 03:46:28,833
MATT: Okay, as you step off and look into its
eyes, your eyes flare the bright yellow color and

3356
03:46:28,833 --> 03:46:34,434
the gloomstalker nods, takes a step back, and then
leaps onto the side of the tower, its claws

3357
03:46:34,434 --> 03:46:39,152
gripping in. As it bats its wings, it takes off
and starts heading upward.

3358
03:46:39,152 --> 03:46:41,352
JOE: Circle at the top and wait for my command!

3359
03:46:41,352 --> 03:46:45,620
MATT: It seems to acknowledge your command.

3360
03:46:45,620 --> 03:46:48,479
JOE: All right, now at disadvantage, rolling in
heavy plate.

3361
03:46:48,479 --> 03:46:49,963
TRAVIS: You got it.

3362
03:46:49,963 --> 03:46:57,277
JOE: Do I have a plus ten? Sweet. Yeah, I got
this. All right. Nine, 27.

3363
03:46:57,277 --> 03:47:02,066
MATT: Okay, so. 27. Two and two, 15, 15. Natural
20.

3364
03:47:02,066 --> 03:47:03,393
MARISHA: 29.

3365
03:47:03,393 --> 03:47:06,022
LIAM: Oh, it was a one, but it's a 37 now.

3366
03:47:06,022 --> 03:47:07,406
LAURA: Because you rolled a luck? What?

3367
03:47:07,406 --> 03:47:10,930
LIAM: No, Matt told me that, because of reliable
talent, one means shit.

3368
03:47:10,930 --> 03:47:12,983
MATT: He always has a ten minimum.

3369
03:47:12,983 --> 03:47:15,583
LAURA: That's fucking badass! 37.

3370
03:47:15,583 --> 03:47:19,126
ASHLEY: 21.

3371
03:47:19,126 --> 03:47:20,669
TRAVIS: 22.

3372
03:47:20,669 --> 03:47:25,333
MATT: All right. So as you guys all dart in around
this rot behemoth, who pays no mind to your

3373
03:47:25,333 --> 03:47:33,843
presence, you dart into the partially ajar doorway
into the base of Entropis, the tower itself. It's

3374
03:47:33,843 --> 03:47:39,463
dark inside. As soon as you all dart into the
interior, the doors are still partially open and

3375
03:47:39,463 --> 03:47:45,547
you can see the faint glow of the very low general
light that encompasses the city of Thar Amphala.

3376
03:47:45,547 --> 03:47:53,905
The normal greenish-blue glow of the shield is
offset a little bit by the natural light that's

3377
03:47:53,905 --> 03:47:57,743
coming through from the opening of the barrier
that you guys have opened. However, the light

3378
03:47:57,743 --> 03:48:03,274
still diminishes as you step into this large
chamber. As soon as you enter the chamber, those

3379
03:48:03,274 --> 03:48:12,268
of you with darkvision glance around and see, it's
a big thoroughfare. You see a large foyer-type

3380
03:48:12,268 --> 03:48:21,376
chamber with pillars that go from bottom to maybe
25, 30 feet up, to a ceiling. Across the way, you

3381
03:48:21,376 --> 03:48:29,325
can see two spiral staircases that curl upward and
there, maybe, 30 or so humanoid figures that are

3382
03:48:29,325 --> 03:48:31,675
in the center of this chamber.

3383
03:48:31,675 --> 03:48:33,500
SAM: What are they doing?

3384
03:48:33,500 --> 03:48:40,868
MATT: Well, as soon as you guys step and turn
around, they all turn and look at you and begin

3385
03:48:40,868 --> 03:48:42,804
to-- (sluggish footsteps).

3386
03:48:42,804 --> 03:48:44,056
LAURA: We need that orb.

3387
03:48:44,056 --> 03:48:47,255
TALIESIN: Once they're within range of us, I'm
going to wait.

3388
03:48:47,255 --> 03:48:49,526
MATT: I mean, a lot of them are going to be right
up on you, right now.

3389
03:48:49,526 --> 03:48:54,351
JOE: Can I sense what kind they are? Divine Sense,
tell what type of fiend, celestial, or undead they are?

3390
03:48:54,351 --> 03:49:00,481
MATT: They are undead. They appear to be mostly of
the baseline skeletal or zombie variety. It's a

3391
03:49:00,481 --> 03:49:02,619
cluster of undead that are set here.

3392
03:49:02,619 --> 03:49:12,017
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to tug on the rope and
pull it up and toss the gem right smack-dab in the

3393
03:49:12,017 --> 03:49:17,800
center of us. Unless somebody else wants to throw
it. Eh, it doesn't matter. I just yanked it.

3394
03:49:17,800 --> 03:49:21,750
MATT: Okay, you yank it. Go ahead and make a roll.
See if it's destroyed or not.

3395
03:49:21,750 --> 03:49:23,157
TALIESIN: Nope, it's good.

3396
03:49:23,157 --> 03:49:27,929
MATT: All right. The stone (clattering) arcs in
the center. The blue pulse-glow light billows out.

3397
03:49:27,929 --> 03:49:33,151
You see the various skeletons and zombies charge
into the light. They stop and stare at it. Let's see.

3398
03:49:33,151 --> 03:49:34,662
TALIESIN: DC 15.

3399
03:49:34,662 --> 03:49:35,955
LIAM: 30 rolls.

3400
03:49:35,955 --> 03:49:41,654
SAM: Pike, can't you kill masses of undead?

3401
03:49:41,654 --> 03:49:48,142
MATT: Okay, so of the 30 or so, about 20 of them
stop and stare at the glow while you hear a

3402
03:49:48,142 --> 03:49:50,725
bounding, heavy footfall sound behind where you
came from.

3403
03:49:50,725 --> 03:49:55,391
TALIESIN: He was not still within range?

3404
03:49:55,391 --> 03:50:01,714
MATT: No, you pulled the stone from where you
were, inside the chamber now, so he's now rushing

3405
03:50:01,714 --> 03:50:03,308
in after where the stone went.

3406
03:50:03,308 --> 03:50:05,161
LIAM: This'll still work. Spread, and let him run
right into the range of it?

3407
03:50:05,161 --> 03:50:07,404
LAURA: Oh, we can get out of the way and let him
maybe run into the undead that are--

3408
03:50:07,404 --> 03:50:09,157
LIAM: As soon as he enters he's in range, isn't
he?

3409
03:50:09,157 --> 03:50:14,163
MATT: Possibly. Up to you guys. But technically,
undead are still rushing in toward you and they're

3410
03:50:14,163 --> 03:50:19,854
immediately scrambling, with their claws and
teeth, out there. Let's say, for the people at

3411
03:50:19,854 --> 03:50:26,811
front here, it's going to be probably the two of
you who first made it in, so three attacks against

3412
03:50:26,811 --> 03:50:31,062
each of you. That is an 18 against you, Vax.

3413
03:50:31,062 --> 03:50:32,101
LIAM: No.

3414
03:50:32,101 --> 03:50:34,516
MATT: That is a 20 against you.

3415
03:50:34,516 --> 03:50:37,149
LIAM: No.

3416
03:50:37,149 --> 03:50:42,651
MATT: No, that misses. Three against you. Natural
20. A 20.

3417
03:50:42,651 --> 03:50:45,400
LAURA: No.

3418
03:50:45,537 --> 03:50:48,452
MATT: And a natural one. All right, so while they
scramble at you and you push them back at bay, one

3419
03:50:48,452 --> 03:50:54,005
of them does manage to get through. It's going to
be 12 points of slashing damage against you, Vex,

3420
03:50:54,072 --> 03:50:57,840
as one of them swings at you with a rusty blade
that carves past you.

3421
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,642
LAURA: Okay.

3422
03:50:59,642 --> 03:51:01,902
MATT: All right. What are you guys doing?

3423
03:51:01,902 --> 03:51:09,140
ASHLEY: How many of them? About 30?

3424
03:51:09,140 --> 03:51:11,537
MATT: About 30 of them, yeah.

3425
03:51:11,537 --> 03:51:13,991
LIAM: Pickle, can you release a Sarenrae bomb?

3426
03:51:13,991 --> 03:51:21,760
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll take out my Mace of Disruption.
I don't want to use any more spells.

3427
03:51:21,760 --> 03:51:25,508
MATT: You have your Channel Divinity, your turn
undead. Or destroy undead.

3428
03:51:25,508 --> 03:51:26,822
LAURA: Yeah, destroy undead.

3429
03:51:26,822 --> 03:51:28,740
ASHLEY: Do I want to wait?

3430
03:51:28,740 --> 03:51:30,493
LAURA: I don't know how many undead we're going to
face--

3431
03:51:30,493 --> 03:51:35,058
LIAM: Vecna's going to be too powerful for a
destroy or turn undead. It's for weak-ass shit

3432
03:51:35,058 --> 03:51:36,216
like this.

3433
03:51:36,216 --> 03:51:38,940
LAURA: But he might have, you know, I don't know
what kind of army he's going to have up top, so

3434
03:51:38,940 --> 03:51:40,073
it's up to you.

3435
03:51:40,073 --> 03:51:41,792
ASHLEY: Well, I have another one.

3436
03:51:41,792 --> 03:51:44,978
LAURA: So maybe do one of them?

3437
03:51:44,978 --> 03:51:46,824
ASHLEY: So I can do it now, yeah.

3438
03:51:46,824 --> 03:51:49,089
MATT: Okay, so as you rush in toward where this
Pulse Stone is, as the crowd of undead are

3439
03:51:49,089 --> 03:51:54,336
gathered in, you hunker down, clutch your holy
symbol, and release a wave of divine energy, the

3440
03:51:54,336 --> 03:52:02,488
whispers and prayer of Sarenrae emanating from you
like a caustic wave against undead energy. What's

3441
03:52:02,488 --> 03:52:04,244
the DC on that?

3442
03:52:04,244 --> 03:52:11,555
ASHLEY: It's not written down.

3443
03:52:11,555 --> 03:52:14,418
MATT: It's your spell DC.

3444
03:52:14,418 --> 03:52:15,524
LAURA: Oh, 18.

3445
03:52:15,524 --> 03:52:16,654
MATT: Okay, 18.

3446
03:52:16,654 --> 03:52:35,960
SAM: Wisdom, intelligence, or charisma.

3447
03:52:35,960 --> 03:52:37,331
LIAM: Wisdom for clerics.

3448
03:52:37,331 --> 03:52:38,824
SAM: Has your wisdom gone up at all?

3449
03:52:38,824 --> 03:52:44,223
LIAM: Eight, plus five, plus your proficiency
bonus. 14, 20.

3450
03:52:44,223 --> 03:52:48,655
LAURA: You're at six proficiency bonus, now.
You're not at--

3451
03:52:48,655 --> 03:52:50,957
ASHLEY: I am? I didn't know that.

3452
03:52:50,957 --> 03:52:56,065
LAURA: So your DC is 19. Sorry, Matt.

3453
03:52:56,065 --> 03:53:06,502
MATT: It's okay. I lost count. Even with their
saves, four undead survive. As the shock wave

3454
03:53:06,502 --> 03:53:15,026
emanates out from you, you watch as about two
dozen of these various skeletons and zombies, many

3455
03:53:15,026 --> 03:53:19,799
of which are grasping at you, turn to ash. One of
them, you see it reaching out toward you, you get

3456
03:53:19,799 --> 03:53:24,194
a glimpse of it. You can see, this one's a fresher
corpse, one of the zombies. It has dirty blonde

3457
03:53:24,194 --> 03:53:28,863
hair, a torn chin with stubble, and for a brief
minute you can see-- it has this gash in its

3458
03:53:28,863 --> 03:53:32,919
stomach, a partially eaten arm. For a brief
minute, as it reaches out for you before the wave

3459
03:53:32,919 --> 03:53:38,665
hits, you're like, "Aldor?" Turns to ash.

3460
03:53:38,665 --> 03:53:40,558
MARISHA: Aldor?

3461
03:53:40,558 --> 03:53:43,412
MATT: A member of the Slayer's Take. Once the
prized love of--

3462
03:53:43,412 --> 03:53:45,010
SAM: Felicia Day!

3463
03:53:45,010 --> 03:53:46,204
(gasping)

3464
03:53:46,204 --> 03:53:47,109
LAURA: No!

3465
03:53:47,109 --> 03:53:48,541
MARISHA: No, Aldor!

3466
03:53:48,541 --> 03:53:49,460
SAM: Oh, no!

3467
03:53:49,460 --> 03:53:55,385
MATT: As the flash expands, you glance around and
you see a withered gnome corpse has been reaching

3468
03:53:55,385 --> 03:53:58,961
toward you. Mostly bald head in places. You
recognize, this is one of your companions, Grubby,

3469
03:53:58,961 --> 03:54:01,456
before the wave hits and he turns to ash.

3470
03:54:01,456 --> 03:54:04,999
SAM: You just killed two of our friends, Pike!

3471
03:54:04,999 --> 03:54:06,825
LAURA: Don't do that to her!

3472
03:54:06,825 --> 03:54:08,134
ASHLEY: Fuck off, I didn't know!

3473
03:54:08,134 --> 03:54:14,679
MATT: All of these are long dead. As this burst of
energy hits and all of a sudden dust and ash fill

3474
03:54:14,679 --> 03:54:16,133
the chamber around you--

3475
03:54:16,133 --> 03:54:18,896
LAURA: Did it do anything to the rot behemoth
coming in?

3476
03:54:18,896 --> 03:54:23,672
MATT: The rot behemoth behind-- what is the DC on
him?

3477
03:54:23,672 --> 03:54:25,468
LIAM: Challenge rating of four or lower.

3478
03:54:25,468 --> 03:54:28,367
MATT: Yeah, it's higher than a challenge rating
four, so it doesn't affect him at all. But the

3479
03:54:28,367 --> 03:54:33,048
four of you, easy enough to cleave him down, but
we'll see if he's even affected by the stone. So

3480
03:54:33,048 --> 03:54:42,743
the last four that are there, as they charge into
the stone, nope! None of them make their save, so

3481
03:54:42,743 --> 03:54:48,773
the last four that are still there, all stop and
stare and glare at this stone in the center of the

3482
03:54:48,773 --> 03:54:54,304
chamber. The rot behemoth comes looming in.
(crashing) What's the DC?

3483
03:54:54,304 --> 03:54:55,622
TALIESIN: DC is 15.

3484
03:54:55,622 --> 03:54:58,910
MATT: 14, does not make it. By one!

3485
03:54:58,910 --> 03:55:02,217
LIAM: Don't worry, Matt. Your luck is coming
upstairs.

3486
03:55:02,217 --> 03:55:08,422
MATT: That's true, that's true. So the rot
behemoth (crashing) through the door and then

3487
03:55:08,422 --> 03:55:15,686
stays there, staring at the stone, blocking the
doorway and holding it in place. But now this

3488
03:55:15,686 --> 03:55:16,851
chamber's open.

3489
03:55:16,851 --> 03:55:18,274
LAURA: Should we kill this shit while we're
stunned?

3490
03:55:18,274 --> 03:55:19,364
SAM: No, we should just run up!

3491
03:55:19,364 --> 03:55:20,806
LAURA: How do we know we're not going to run into
a whole bunch more?

3492
03:55:20,806 --> 03:55:22,970
TALIESIN: Which is why we're going to keep the
rope. We're going to go all the way up the stairs,

3493
03:55:22,970 --> 03:55:25,324
and when we're ready, we're going to tug like a
motherfucker.

3494
03:55:25,324 --> 03:55:29,917
LAURA: Okay, and then all these things are going
to chase after us?

3495
03:55:29,917 --> 03:55:32,665
MATT: They'll keep following you. Every time you
pull the stone, they're going to come toward you.

3496
03:55:32,665 --> 03:55:34,393
LAURA: So we might as well kill them now, while
they're stunned.

3497
03:55:34,393 --> 03:55:36,352
TALIESIN: All right, one at a time. Let's kill one
at a time.

3498
03:55:36,352 --> 03:55:39,848
SAM: The giant's going to take more than one hit.

3499
03:55:39,848 --> 03:55:42,797
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we're going to get him.

3500
03:55:42,797 --> 03:55:45,488
MATT: We'll say, easy enough for you guys to
coordinate. The skeletons are easy enough to

3501
03:55:45,488 --> 03:55:56,455
destroy. The rot behemoth, all in one swoop, you
guys can take down as one quick blast on it. One

3502
03:55:56,455 --> 03:56:01,607
of the skeletons, you also recognize: a heavily
charred zombie making a horrid sighing sound as

3503
03:56:01,607 --> 03:56:04,219
it's sitting there, staring at the stone. You see
the remains of Vander.

3504
03:56:04,219 --> 03:56:05,717
JOE: Is he damaged?

3505
03:56:05,717 --> 03:56:08,809
MATT: Burnt to a cinder. The last thing you saw
was him being immolated and screaming.

3506
03:56:08,809 --> 03:56:12,420
JOE: I'd like to Channel Divinity and Control
Undead.

3507
03:56:12,420 --> 03:56:17,534
MATT: Okay. And with that, before you destroy the
zombie--

3508
03:56:17,534 --> 03:56:20,017
JOE: It's a wisdom save.

3509
03:56:20,017 --> 03:56:30,540
MATT: Wisdom save? Three. Nope. You've got two
zombies. Delilah and now your previous ally,

3510
03:56:30,645 --> 03:56:34,306
Vander. Turns from the stone. (wheezing)

3511
03:56:34,306 --> 03:56:35,801
JOE: This is fucking dark.

3512
03:56:35,801 --> 03:56:39,296
TALIESIN: I'm really excited about the notion of a
Delilah potted plant.

3513
03:56:39,296 --> 03:56:44,248
JOE: It's my brother's character from our home
group!

3514
03:56:44,248 --> 03:56:47,446
LIAM: You are now Michonne, from Walking Dead. You
got two zombies.

3515
03:56:47,446 --> 03:56:51,355
TRAVIS: Bring them into the CRU, you got them!

3516
03:56:51,355 --> 03:57:01,559
JOE: Zombie Vander, aw man. This is like, rattling
whatever blackened heart my character has. Okay.

3517
03:57:01,559 --> 03:57:05,090
LIAM: All right, well, up we go, then, yeah?

3518
03:57:05,090 --> 03:57:06,338
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

3519
03:57:06,338 --> 03:57:07,539
LIAM: I'm going to look for traps, as we go.

3520
03:57:07,539 --> 03:57:08,923
MATT: All right, make an investigation check.

3521
03:57:08,923 --> 03:57:11,057
SAM: Everyone all healed up to full?

3522
03:57:11,057 --> 03:57:12,082
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

3523
03:57:12,082 --> 03:57:14,488
SAM: Should we pause and heal, or--?

3524
03:57:14,488 --> 03:57:15,876
LAURA: Pause for 30 minutes and heal?

3525
03:57:15,876 --> 03:57:18,843
TRAVIS: Vasselheim was just out the window.

3526
03:57:18,843 --> 03:57:21,499
LIAM: Two miles away, ish.

3527
03:57:21,499 --> 03:57:22,656
MATT: What'd you roll?

3528
03:57:22,656 --> 03:57:23,954
LIAM: 18.

3529
03:57:23,954 --> 03:57:24,941
MATT: 18, okay.

3530
03:57:24,941 --> 03:57:28,795
SAM: If you take a potion, you're full. Right?
Don't you have your thing going, or no, is that gone?

3531
03:57:28,795 --> 03:57:30,956
TRAVIS: Beacon of Hope.

3532
03:57:30,956 --> 03:57:36,530
LAURA: Beacon of Hope just means it heals the max
that a healing spell or a healing potion can do.

3533
03:57:36,530 --> 03:57:38,721
You don't automatically go to full health.

3534
03:57:38,721 --> 03:57:39,452
TRAVIS: 2d8, 16.

3535
03:57:39,452 --> 03:57:41,314
SAM: Oh, I didn't know that.

3536
03:57:41,314 --> 03:57:43,019
MATT: How long does Beacon of Hope last?

3537
03:57:43,019 --> 03:57:46,732
LIAM: One minute.

3538
03:57:46,732 --> 03:57:48,667
MATT: Beacon is gone.

3539
03:57:48,667 --> 03:57:51,188
LAURA: That's okay. Do you have a healing spell
for people?

3540
03:57:51,188 --> 03:57:52,419
ASHLEY: I do.

3541
03:57:52,419 --> 03:57:56,087
TRAVIS: Are we doing a group thing right now?

3542
03:57:56,087 --> 03:57:59,266
LIAM: Are we short resting or we doing little
healies?

3543
03:57:59,266 --> 03:58:00,857
LAURA: I don't think we have 30 minutes.

3544
03:58:00,857 --> 03:58:05,978
MARISHA: We need a full 30 minutes to do a quick
short rest?

3545
03:58:05,978 --> 03:58:09,001
MATT: Technically it's a full hour, by the rules.
I let it slide a little faster in times of

3546
03:58:09,001 --> 03:58:18,201
intensity. I'd allow a 30-minute quick rest, but
that's still--

3547
03:58:18,201 --> 03:58:21,274
TALIESIN: I would not say no to it, but I can live
without it.

3548
03:58:21,274 --> 03:58:24,733
LAURA: I don't know, I mean, they're fighting at
Vasselheim right now.

3549
03:58:24,733 --> 03:58:26,652
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're at the gates.

3550
03:58:26,652 --> 03:58:31,748
MARISHA: I'm at 94 hit points, I'm down about 50
or so hit points.

3551
03:58:31,748 --> 03:58:36,490
LIAM: I'm telling you, though, it's this or
nothing. If we fall here, if we fail, then it's

3552
03:58:36,490 --> 03:58:42,499
fucked, so even if it destroys half the city, it's
better to have all of us at full fighting

3553
03:58:42,499 --> 03:58:43,362
potential.

3554
03:58:43,362 --> 03:58:50,761
JOE: I would like to cast Death Ward on myself.
4th-level spell slot.

3555
03:58:50,761 --> 03:58:52,010
MATT: Okay.

3556
03:58:52,010 --> 03:58:53,598
TRAVIS: All right, do it. Do the short rest. Just
do it.

3557
03:58:53,598 --> 03:58:57,110
SAM: Wait, we're doing a short rest? Wait, who
needs it?

3558
03:58:57,110 --> 03:58:59,095
TALIESIN: We honestly all do.

3559
03:58:59,095 --> 03:59:03,805
LAURA: We all need healing. I'm 40 points down.

3560
03:59:03,805 --> 03:59:11,843
MARISHA: I'm 50 points down, and I burned both of
my shape change. Who else is down far?

3561
03:59:11,843 --> 03:59:15,416
TRAVIS: A quarter, or half, of Vasselheim, is--

3562
03:59:15,416 --> 03:59:18,118
SAM: Don't you have a healing spell?

3563
03:59:18,118 --> 03:59:22,096
ASHLEY: I do, but it depends on the roll.

3564
03:59:22,096 --> 03:59:26,001
SAM: No no, because it maximizes it.

3565
03:59:26,001 --> 03:59:33,137
LAURA: No, we don't have it anymore.

3566
03:59:33,137 --> 03:59:34,506
ASHLEY: Yeah, so if I roll bad, or--

3567
03:59:34,506 --> 03:59:36,406
LIAM: No, but we have hit dice. You don't need the
spells.

3568
03:59:36,406 --> 03:59:37,708
SAM: Bye, Vasselheim.

3569
03:59:37,708 --> 03:59:39,917
MATT: All right, so you guys are taking a short
rest in the inside of Entropis?

3570
03:59:39,917 --> 03:59:41,213
MARISHA: No, look, super short.

3571
03:59:41,213 --> 03:59:44,304
MATT: There is no super-short rest. It's a short
rest.

3572
03:59:44,304 --> 03:59:46,353
SAM: Seems terrible.

3573
03:59:46,353 --> 03:59:49,506
MATT: Vasselheim was in sight when you were
outside.

3574
03:59:49,506 --> 03:59:51,514
MARISHA: I don't know! What do you want?

3575
03:59:51,514 --> 03:59:53,074
MATT: I'm just letting you know!

3576
03:59:53,074 --> 03:59:56,317
SAM: We have potions! Can't we drink potions?

3577
03:59:56,317 --> 04:00:01,034
JOE: Listen, you're not going to need the potions
after today. I'm just saying.

3578
04:00:01,034 --> 04:00:04,331
LAURA: Might as well take them.

3579
04:00:04,331 --> 04:00:05,615
TRAVIS: Don't take your superior, though.

3580
04:00:05,615 --> 04:00:06,951
SAM: No, we have other ones, though.

3581
04:00:06,951 --> 04:00:09,534
LAURA: Can you try healing and see what it does?

3582
04:00:09,534 --> 04:00:14,260
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do Mass Cure Wounds on you
guys.

3583
04:00:14,260 --> 04:00:16,082
LAURA: What does that do?

3584
04:00:16,082 --> 04:00:20,685
MARISHA: I don't know, but we also, we broke down
the barrier, so Vasselheim can defend itself a

3585
04:00:20,685 --> 04:00:22,174
little more.

3586
04:00:22,174 --> 04:00:24,083
TRAVIS: One-sixth of the pie.

3587
04:00:24,083 --> 04:00:28,501
MARISHA: I'm 50 points down and without my beast
shape.

3588
04:00:28,501 --> 04:00:29,779
LAURA: You don't have beast shape?

3589
04:00:29,779 --> 04:00:34,202
MARISHA: I used it to go earth elemental, because
I thought the Briarwood fight might be a little

3590
04:00:34,202 --> 04:00:39,777
bit more beefy than it was. But I don't
necessarily need it.

3591
04:00:39,777 --> 04:00:42,489
TRAVIS: Vote as a group. Hand up if you want a
short rest.

3592
04:00:42,489 --> 04:00:44,070
SAM: No.

3593
04:00:44,070 --> 04:00:49,632
TRAVIS: No hands? Just put your hand up if you
want it.

3594
04:00:49,632 --> 04:00:52,436
TALIESIN: I will admit, it would do a lot for me.

3595
04:00:52,436 --> 04:00:53,757
TRAVIS: Keyleth, put your hand up.

3596
04:00:53,757 --> 04:00:54,983
LIAM: I'm going to put up because I think that
these two need it.

3597
04:00:54,983 --> 04:00:56,425
TRAVIS: I'll tie-break it.

3598
04:00:56,425 --> 04:00:58,365
LAURA: So short rest? Short rest. Okay.

3599
04:00:58,365 --> 04:00:59,787
SAM: Vasselheim.

3600
04:00:59,787 --> 04:01:06,483
MARISHA: To quote the leaders of Vasselheim, "They
have defended themselves through many forms of battle."

3601
04:01:06,483 --> 04:01:10,903
JOE: That vampire's going to be up there, full
strength. He's going to be back. He's going to be

3602
04:01:10,903 --> 04:01:12,171
back full strength.

3603
04:01:12,171 --> 04:01:13,431
LAURA: He might not be back full strength yet!

3604
04:01:13,431 --> 04:01:14,435
JOE: He'll be back something.

3605
04:01:14,435 --> 04:01:15,868
LAURA: He takes a while to rest up.

3606
04:01:15,868 --> 04:01:17,273
JOE: It's 25 a minute, isn't it?

3607
04:01:17,273 --> 04:01:18,913
TRAVIS: It's super fast.

3608
04:01:18,913 --> 04:01:26,099
MATT: He regenerates 25-- Well, there's a lot of
things at work here. It depends. Roll a religion check.

3609
04:01:26,099 --> 04:01:29,347
TRAVIS: Natural one.

3610
04:01:29,347 --> 04:01:31,138
TALIESIN: I'll try a religion check.

3611
04:01:31,138 --> 04:01:39,798
JOE: I'm a paladin with terrible religion skills.
Blind faith.

3612
04:01:39,798 --> 04:01:45,305
MATT: All right, but still roll a religion check.
Seeing as how undead is your domain.

3613
04:01:45,305 --> 04:01:46,976
LIAM: Just roll a natural 20, Joe.

3614
04:01:46,976 --> 04:01:48,218
JOE: I rolled a natural 18.

3615
04:01:48,218 --> 04:01:50,104
MATT: Plus?

3616
04:01:50,104 --> 04:01:53,158
JOE: Zero, for religion.

3617
04:01:53,158 --> 04:02:00,664
MATT: Okay, okay. You know this because of your
experience with undead and amassing yourself a

3618
04:02:00,664 --> 04:02:09,101
necromantic energy since breaking your oath long
ago. When a vampire is reduced to zero hit points

3619
04:02:09,101 --> 04:02:14,903
and goes into mist form, it has two hours to
return to its resting place. When it reaches its

3620
04:02:14,903 --> 04:02:21,457
resting place, it has to rest for one hour. Once
it rests for the one hour, it goes back to one hit

3621
04:02:21,457 --> 04:02:25,804
point and then it regenerates 25 hit points, or at
least, Sylas, every single round.

3622
04:02:25,804 --> 04:02:28,169
LIAM: Roughly how much time has passed since we
went from--?

3623
04:02:28,169 --> 04:02:34,730
MATT: I'd say 30-ish minutes or so. 30 or 40,
because you've been slowly stealthing your way

3624
04:02:34,730 --> 04:02:36,912
through, being careful.

3625
04:02:36,912 --> 04:02:38,664
LIAM: Right right, but probably his box of dirt is
not--

3626
04:02:38,664 --> 04:02:43,151
MATT: So if you take a short rest, you're probably
going to look at a Sylas waiting for you somewhere

3627
04:02:43,151 --> 04:02:44,523
up top.

3628
04:02:44,523 --> 04:02:47,699
LAURA: It's going to take two hours to get up the
tower?

3629
04:02:47,699 --> 04:02:51,574
SAM: It's a big tower. There's lots of shit up
there.

3630
04:02:51,574 --> 04:02:54,385
MATT: No, meaning, if you guys take a short rest,
he needs to rest for an hour. It took you 40

3631
04:02:54,385 --> 04:02:58,524
minutes since that happened to get to the tower.
If you take a short rest, you're going to have to

3632
04:02:58,524 --> 04:02:59,595
deal with a Sylas.

3633
04:02:59,595 --> 04:03:02,638
TALIESIN: I mean fuck it, if we heal ourselves--

3634
04:03:02,638 --> 04:03:05,825
SAM: Scanlan's got healing. Scanlan Two's got
healing. We can pump you guys up.

3635
04:03:05,825 --> 04:03:08,227
TRAVIS: Because he also turns people, right?

3636
04:03:08,227 --> 04:03:09,416
TALIESIN: He does turn people.

3637
04:03:09,416 --> 04:03:11,106
TRAVIS: I barely made that save.

3638
04:03:11,106 --> 04:03:12,770
LAURA: We need to not rest.

3639
04:03:12,770 --> 04:03:17,200
TALIESIN: How much heal do you get out of a
potion?

3640
04:03:17,200 --> 04:03:19,547
ASHLEY: Who's bad?

3641
04:03:19,547 --> 04:03:21,636
MARISHA: I'm not great.

3642
04:03:21,636 --> 04:03:24,176
ASHLEY: You're bad? Who else?

3643
04:03:24,176 --> 04:03:27,511
JOE: I could use some, seeing that I have tank
duties.

3644
04:03:27,511 --> 04:03:28,993
SAM: How many can you include?

3645
04:03:28,993 --> 04:03:34,480
ASHLEY: Okay, is anybody down? I'm going to do
Prayer of Healing. I want to save Mass Cure Wounds.

3646
04:03:34,480 --> 04:03:36,539
MARISHA: I'm at 94 hit points, so I'm down--

3647
04:03:36,539 --> 04:03:39,114
JOE: I'm down 42, but I could probably heal--

3648
04:03:39,114 --> 04:03:42,786
MATT: You could take a short rest, but understand
and be prepared with the knowledge of knowing that

3649
04:03:42,786 --> 04:03:46,794
you're also going-- put some things in your
chamber that will be helpful against a vampire.

3650
04:03:46,794 --> 04:03:52,086
SAM: Scanlan Two has tons of healing spells that
he can use, so use them. He's going to be dead

3651
04:03:52,086 --> 04:03:54,006
soon anyway.

3652
04:03:54,006 --> 04:03:59,187
MARISHA: You guys don't want us losing any of our
spellcasters right now. I'm at 94. It's not a lot,

3653
04:03:59,187 --> 04:04:03,123
it's not bad, but it's bad enough. I'm a third of
my hit points down.

3654
04:04:03,123 --> 04:04:08,380
MATT: You do have a battery of low-level spell
slots right now that can be used to heal things up

3655
04:04:08,380 --> 04:04:09,848
if you want to.

3656
04:04:09,848 --> 04:04:11,464
SAM: Yeah, I can heal you and heal you and heal
you until you're all done.

3657
04:04:11,464 --> 04:04:15,105
MARISHA: Yeah, but every time you heal me and heal
me and heal me, it's taking away from something

3658
04:04:15,105 --> 04:04:16,497
else mechanically.

3659
04:04:16,497 --> 04:04:18,893
SAM: It's a level one bullshit spell slot.

3660
04:04:18,893 --> 04:04:23,517
TALIESIN: But it's also healing that could be done
in combat. That's what we're meaning.

3661
04:04:23,517 --> 04:04:25,950
MARISHA: I'm resigning my decision right now.

3662
04:04:25,950 --> 04:04:34,636
MATT: Make a choice here, guys. You're wasting
time in the tower.

3663
04:04:34,636 --> 04:04:41,170
SAM: No short rest! Heal some people, I'll heal
some more. We got this. We got lots of healing.

3664
04:04:41,170 --> 04:04:44,522
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just use a 2nd-level for 16
points of healing for six people who need it.

3665
04:04:44,522 --> 04:04:45,613
SAM: Great!

3666
04:04:45,613 --> 04:04:47,206
MARISHA: 16 points? I'll take that.

3667
04:04:47,206 --> 04:04:48,458
LAURA: I'm taking one.

3668
04:04:48,458 --> 04:04:49,491
SAM: I will take it as well.

3669
04:04:49,491 --> 04:04:50,838
TALIESIN: How many people have taken it so far?

3670
04:04:50,838 --> 04:04:55,498
SAM: You said up to six people? I'll take that.

3671
04:04:55,498 --> 04:05:00,883
MARISHA: 110, I'm still 31 hit points down.

3672
04:05:00,883 --> 04:05:06,440
SAM: I will cast Healing Word, or Scanlan Two will
cast Healing Word at 2nd-level for you.

3673
04:05:06,440 --> 04:05:07,505
MARISHA: For me?

3674
04:05:07,505 --> 04:05:08,884
SAM: Yeah. That's--

3675
04:05:08,884 --> 04:05:11,265
MATT: You can use Cure Wounds as opposed to
Healing Word.

3676
04:05:11,265 --> 04:05:12,562
SAM: I don't have Cure Wounds.

3677
04:05:12,562 --> 04:05:14,087
MATT: Oh, that's right. Never mind.

3678
04:05:14,087 --> 04:05:18,670
SAM: That's nine more points for you.

3679
04:05:18,670 --> 04:05:20,050
MARISH: For me?

3680
04:05:20,050 --> 04:05:21,781
SAM: Yeah. Oh, wait! I can sing a Song of Rest.

3681
04:05:21,781 --> 04:05:24,481
MATT: That takes a short rest to do.

3682
04:05:24,481 --> 04:05:25,703
SAM: Yeah. That makes sense.

3683
04:05:25,703 --> 04:05:29,212
MARISHA: I could do my speech if I had a short
rest.

3684
04:05:29,212 --> 04:05:31,378
LAURA: Well, you can do the speech as we climb up
the tower!

3685
04:05:31,378 --> 04:05:35,616
JOE: How much are you short? She's 22 short?

3686
04:05:35,616 --> 04:05:43,680
LAURA: The speech does what? Does the speech
regain hit points?

3687
04:05:43,680 --> 04:05:45,700
MATT: Ten minutes to say the speech.

3688
04:05:45,700 --> 04:05:47,412
LAURA: So as we climb the tower, she could be
saying it?

3689
04:05:47,412 --> 04:05:48,704
MATT: Perhaps, yeah.

3690
04:05:48,704 --> 04:05:51,902
SAM: I will heal you another 2nd-level healing
spell.

3691
04:05:51,902 --> 04:05:54,842
LAURA: A Greater Healing Potion is 4d4?

3692
04:05:54,842 --> 04:05:58,970
MATT: You've got it. 4d4 plus four.

3693
04:05:58,970 --> 04:06:00,566
SAM: That's another 12 points.

3694
04:06:00,566 --> 04:06:05,594
MATT: Consider now, as you guys climb the tower,
if you have any buff spells, if you have any

3695
04:06:05,594 --> 04:06:13,203
long-lasting things that you want to utilize for
the coming fray. Freedom of Movement, Death Ward,

3696
04:06:13,203 --> 04:06:15,495
all the things you guys want to prepare with,
now's the time to do it.

3697
04:06:15,495 --> 04:06:16,861
MARISHA: 141, I'm full.

3698
04:06:16,861 --> 04:06:20,783
LIAM: I'm going to, when we're right on the verge,
when we think we're right on the verge, I'm

3699
04:06:20,783 --> 04:06:23,551
blessing you and you.

3700
04:06:23,551 --> 04:06:24,950
TRAVIS: I think this is the verge.

3701
04:06:24,950 --> 04:06:29,386
MARISHA: Is this the verge? Because if this is the
verge--

3702
04:06:29,386 --> 04:06:31,673
MATT: You still have the tower to climb, but know,
if you have spells, like buffs, to cast that

3703
04:06:31,673 --> 04:06:36,141
aren't concentration and last a while, now's the
time to do it.

3704
04:06:36,141 --> 04:06:37,812
MARISHA: Like, an hour a while?

3705
04:06:37,812 --> 04:06:43,693
JOE: Tiamat gave her 12. I'm going to give 18 to
myself out of my healing pool.

3706
04:06:43,693 --> 04:06:49,009
MARISHA: Pike and I burn all of our 4th level
spell splots to do--

3707
04:06:49,009 --> 04:06:50,200
ASHLEY: Splots!

3708
04:06:50,200 --> 04:06:56,478
MARISHA: Splots! Do all of our spell splots! To
cast Freedom of Movement on anybody. With the

3709
04:06:56,478 --> 04:07:00,940
exception of Percy, who already has it.

3710
04:07:00,940 --> 04:07:02,296
JOE: What does Freedom of Movement do?

3711
04:07:02,296 --> 04:07:03,371
MATT: Wait, how many slots is that for you guys,
then?

3712
04:07:03,371 --> 04:07:04,311
MARISHA: Three each.

3713
04:07:04,311 --> 04:07:05,259
MATT: Three each. Okay.

3714
04:07:05,259 --> 04:07:06,485
MARISHA: Except, we didn't account for--

3715
04:07:06,485 --> 04:07:09,674
SAM: Scanlan Two.

3716
04:07:09,674 --> 04:07:10,942
MARISHA: Or Arkhan.

3717
04:07:10,942 --> 04:07:12,399
JOE: What's happening?

3718
04:07:12,399 --> 04:07:16,804
MATT: Okay. Anything else you want to buff with?

3719
04:07:16,804 --> 04:07:19,764
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to invoke my Blessing of the
Dawnfather.

3720
04:07:19,764 --> 04:07:21,435
MATT: Okay.

3721
04:07:21,435 --> 04:07:26,510
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3722
04:07:26,510 --> 04:07:27,862
MATT: No Death Wards?

3723
04:07:27,862 --> 04:07:29,931
JOE: I did--

3724
04:07:29,931 --> 04:07:32,530
MATT: You did Death Ward to yourself?

3725
04:07:32,530 --> 04:07:34,160
TRAVIS: She has a Death Ward.

3726
04:07:34,160 --> 04:07:36,114
ASHLEY: Wait a second. One of us is without
Freedom of Movement.

3727
04:07:36,114 --> 04:07:40,372
LAURA: Scanlan Two.

3728
04:07:40,372 --> 04:07:41,947
TALIESIN: I have it automatically.

3729
04:07:41,947 --> 04:07:43,261
MARISHA: He has it automatically.

3730
04:07:43,261 --> 04:07:44,411
ASHLEY: Understand.

3731
04:07:44,411 --> 04:07:48,035
LAURA: Can anybody cast some Death Wards too?

3732
04:07:48,035 --> 04:07:49,303
JOE: Wait, I didn't get Freedom of Movement?

3733
04:07:49,303 --> 04:07:50,990
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: No.

3734
04:07:50,990 --> 04:07:56,205
SAM: We did it with an earring. Sorry, you weren't
on.

3735
04:07:56,205 --> 04:08:00,892
JOE: I'm over kicking a can in the corner.

3736
04:08:00,892 --> 04:08:04,447
SAM: We're all on iPhones and you're on a Windows
phone.

3737
04:08:04,447 --> 04:08:10,163
ASHLEY: I don't have another 4th-level, unless I
burn a 5th-level, for Death Ward.

3738
04:08:10,163 --> 04:08:14,825
JOE: Now, I have some funky shit. I have a
Cleansing Touch, anyway, that can end a spell on

3739
04:08:14,825 --> 04:08:19,165
me or any willing creature that I touch, so that
should help.

3740
04:08:19,165 --> 04:08:22,247
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

3741
04:08:22,247 --> 04:08:23,663
SAM: Wait, we're doing things that last an hour?

3742
04:08:23,663 --> 04:08:24,805
LAURA: We're doing things, yeah. We're doing it.

3743
04:08:24,805 --> 04:08:25,753
SAM: Shit.

3744
04:08:25,753 --> 04:08:30,687
MARISHA: I mean, I don't know-- Unless we want to
try and get higher up before we go.

3745
04:08:30,687 --> 04:08:32,179
MATT: That's up to you guys.

3746
04:08:32,179 --> 04:08:36,242
MARISHA: Do we think this is it? Are we sure this
is it?

3747
04:08:36,242 --> 04:08:39,338
LIAM: Is it one of these guys where we can see the
height of the tower, or--?

3748
04:08:39,338 --> 04:08:42,512
MATT: You can't see the height of the tower. It
goes up into another floor.

3749
04:08:42,512 --> 04:08:47,781
MARISHA: Okay, so this means, anything we
encounter, if it's not fucking Vecna, then we're

3750
04:08:47,781 --> 04:08:54,222
barreling through it and going straight up.
Because we've burned everything.

3751
04:08:54,222 --> 04:08:57,534
MATT: If you want to hold your spells until you
get higher, I'll let you do that. Up to you.

3752
04:08:57,534 --> 04:09:03,404
LIAM: There's a death knight.

3753
04:09:03,404 --> 04:09:07,082
MARISHA: I don't know what's worth it. Do we have
any idea of how much higher this tower goes?

3754
04:09:07,082 --> 04:09:08,556
MATT: I mean, it goes pretty high.

3755
04:09:08,556 --> 04:09:12,186
LIAM: Oh, excuse me. Where is Vecna right now? How
high up?

3756
04:09:12,186 --> 04:09:13,632
MATT: Right above you.

3757
04:09:13,632 --> 04:09:15,505
LIAM: Right above us, way up, or a floor up?

3758
04:09:15,505 --> 04:09:16,495
MATT: Way up.

3759
04:09:16,495 --> 04:09:17,471
LIAM: Way up. Okay.

3760
04:09:17,471 --> 04:09:20,040
MARISHA: Do we want to try and jog another ten
minutes before doing this?

3761
04:09:20,040 --> 04:09:24,110
TALIESIN: Let's get halfway up the tower.

3762
04:09:24,110 --> 04:09:27,505
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Before we burn everything--

3763
04:09:27,505 --> 04:09:29,809
MATT: Just letting you guys be prepared here,
because you're Vox Machina.

3764
04:09:29,809 --> 04:09:34,533
MARISHA: Okay, we're going to go ten more minutes
up and I'm going to give a speech as we go.

3765
04:09:34,533 --> 04:09:37,628
LAURA: So I'm invoking the blessing as we get
closer.

3766
04:09:37,628 --> 04:09:40,847
ASHLEY: Does anybody else want Death Ward?

3767
04:09:40,847 --> 04:09:42,753
TALIESIN: No, I'm good.

3768
04:09:42,753 --> 04:09:49,178
MARISHA: I say, okay, guys, as we climb this
tower, I know there's a lot of stairs, but the

3769
04:09:49,178 --> 04:09:52,873
stairs are going to be fucking nothing compared to
Vecna. But holy fuck, these are a lot of fucking stairs.

3770
04:09:52,873 --> 04:09:54,564
SAM: This is inspiring.

3771
04:09:54,564 --> 04:09:56,392
TALIESIN: The stairs are a metaphor.

3772
04:09:56,392 --> 04:10:03,460
MARISHA: The stairs are a metaphor. Each stair
that we get across is going to be like another

3773
04:10:03,460 --> 04:10:11,087
step further into defeating Vecna. You know? With
each stair-- I'm winded.

3774
04:10:11,087 --> 04:10:12,935
LAURA: The stairs are long, but they're not
infinite.

3775
04:10:12,935 --> 04:10:18,027
MARISHA: The stairs are long, but they are not
infinite. Be good and now we're almost there,

3776
04:10:18,027 --> 04:10:22,354
guys! We're almost there! This is it! This is it.
(sobbing and panting)

3777
04:10:22,354 --> 04:10:24,231
LAURA: I feel so inspired, Keyleth. Thank you.

3778
04:10:24,231 --> 04:10:27,157
SAM: Wow, that was so inspiring.

3779
04:10:27,157 --> 04:10:31,508
MARISHA: This is it, you guys! Just keep going up
the stairs! And that's my speech.

3780
04:10:31,508 --> 04:10:34,067
MATT: Okay, take your 17-- no, 19--

3781
04:10:34,067 --> 04:10:35,357
MARISHA: 19 hit points.

3782
04:10:35,357 --> 04:10:38,685
MATT: 19 temporary hit points. Including you.

3783
04:10:38,685 --> 04:10:40,419
JOE: 19 temporary, yeah.

3784
04:10:40,419 --> 04:10:41,731
MARISHA: And they're temporary, not--

3785
04:10:41,731 --> 04:10:43,758
LAURA: In addition to our plus two, so now we have
21.

3786
04:10:43,758 --> 04:10:47,004
MARISHA: Do we heal above that?

3787
04:10:47,004 --> 04:10:52,070
MATT: Yeah. Well, you get temporary hit points,
like a buffer shield.

3788
04:10:52,070 --> 04:10:55,095
MARISHA: Right, so those 19 go first.

3789
04:10:55,095 --> 04:10:56,484
MATT: Correct. Okay.

3790
04:10:56,484 --> 04:11:06,686
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god. Okay, are we
getting near the top?

3791
04:11:06,686 --> 04:11:11,025
JOE: Let me know, because I'm going to throw up.

3792
04:11:11,025 --> 04:11:15,680
TRAVIS: Who wants the Death Ward?

3793
04:11:15,680 --> 04:11:18,021
MARISHA: Yeah, and Pike and I cast whenever seems
appropriate.

3794
04:11:18,021 --> 04:11:19,298
MATT: Right.

3795
04:11:19,298 --> 04:11:22,995
TRAVIS: But who wants it? Who needs it?

3796
04:11:22,995 --> 04:11:26,500
SAM: I mean, who's going to die?

3797
04:11:26,500 --> 04:11:27,945
TALIESIN: This one, definitely.

3798
04:11:27,945 --> 04:11:32,084
LAURA: Okay, here's the thing. The people that
have the trammels should probably have a Death

3799
04:11:32,084 --> 04:11:33,342
Ward, too.

3800
04:11:33,342 --> 04:11:37,428
TRAVIS: I've got my one hit point regenerate,
regenerate, regenerate.

3801
04:11:37,428 --> 04:11:40,489
LAURA: Okay, you're good.

3802
04:11:40,489 --> 04:11:42,478
SAM: Pike can have one.

3803
04:11:42,478 --> 04:11:43,828
ASHLEY: I have my armor.

3804
04:11:43,828 --> 04:11:48,531
LAURA: Okay, so that bumps you back up once you've
gone down once. So really, he needs-- and you,

3805
04:11:48,531 --> 04:11:50,350
well, no. You won't come back right away.

3806
04:11:50,350 --> 04:11:52,490
LIAM: If I have the Death Ward, I will pop back
up.

3807
04:11:52,490 --> 04:11:56,767
MATT: There is only one person that can complete
the Incantation of Sealing.

3808
04:11:56,767 --> 04:11:59,875
SAM: That's me.

3809
04:11:59,875 --> 04:12:02,003
TRAVIS: Sealing of what? Oh, the trammels?

3810
04:12:02,003 --> 04:12:03,433
MATT: Once the trammels are in--

3811
04:12:03,433 --> 04:12:05,016
TRAVIS: You've got to put it on Scanlan.

3812
04:12:05,016 --> 04:12:06,699
TALIESIN: He has to do it. Without Scanlan,
everything goes to shit.

3813
04:12:06,699 --> 04:12:08,153
LIAM: What about Scanlan Two? Can Scanlan Two do
it?

3814
04:12:08,153 --> 04:12:12,076
SAM: Technically. He's not going to last that
long, guys.

3815
04:12:12,076 --> 04:12:14,211
ASHLEY: I cast Death Ward on Scanlan.

3816
04:12:14,211 --> 04:12:18,694
SAM: Pike, I accept your blessing.

3817
04:12:18,694 --> 04:12:24,312
ASHLEY: Scanlan, if we get through this, you know
what that means, don't you?

3818
04:12:24,312 --> 04:12:25,692
SAM: No, what does it mean?

3819
04:12:25,692 --> 04:12:28,334
TALIESIN: It means that your clone's going to get
very lucky. You, on the other hand, no.

3820
04:12:28,334 --> 04:12:31,759
ASHLEY: You'll just have to live. You wait and
find out.

3821
04:12:31,759 --> 04:12:33,996
SAM: Well, what does it mean? What could it
mean?!

3822
04:12:33,996 --> 04:12:36,480
ASHLEY: Just live! You'll see!

3823
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:38,952
SAM: Just then, the real Scanlan comes back from
peeing. He's like, what'd I miss, guys?

3824
04:12:38,952 --> 04:12:51,168
(laughter)

3825
04:12:51,168 --> 04:12:58,523
MATT: Ascending the stairs, you climb and climb,
the spiral continuing upward. Both of the stairs

3826
04:12:58,523 --> 04:13:01,542
spiral upward, so which direction did you take?
The right, or the left?

3827
04:13:01,542 --> 04:13:05,982
LAURA: The right. No, wait! Which hand does Vecna
chop off?

3828
04:13:05,982 --> 04:13:07,214
MATT: The left.

3829
04:13:07,214 --> 04:13:09,672
TRAVIS: What does your speech do, Keyleth, again?

3830
04:13:09,672 --> 04:13:15,904
MARISHA: It gives you an additional 19 hit points.
Temporary hit points. So add plus 19 on top. When

3831
04:13:15,904 --> 04:13:19,016
you lose them, they're gone. Huh?

3832
04:13:19,016 --> 04:13:22,014
SAM: We're trying to decide whether we went left
or right up the stairs.

3833
04:13:22,014 --> 04:13:23,307
TALIESIN: We went right.

3834
04:13:23,307 --> 04:13:31,489
MATT: Okay. You spiral upward and upward and
upward, climbing an extremely long period of time.

3835
04:13:31,489 --> 04:13:39,343
Your legs begin to ache a little bit. Then
another floor opens up. It appears the tower is

3836
04:13:39,343 --> 04:13:45,494
now divided into two chambers. From the bottom
floor up, it's now two sides to a tower and you're

3837
04:13:45,494 --> 04:13:53,538
on the right side. The hallway curves around the
outer edge of the tower. On the opposite side, you

3838
04:13:53,538 --> 04:14:01,315
can see the staircase continues upward. The
interior of this chamber appears to be an

3839
04:14:01,315 --> 04:14:08,462
incredible arcane laboratory, occupying the center
space of the tower inside. You see six overlapping

3840
04:14:08,462 --> 04:14:11,998
circles of dulled runes and glyphs that encompass
the entire 30-foot walkway between here and the

3841
04:14:11,998 --> 04:14:20,495
stairs. Shelves and tables of countless glass
tubes and metallic vices lay out across tables,

3842
04:14:20,495 --> 04:14:29,620
organized in a near-OCD pattern. Tomes and books
line the inner chamber walls. What do you guys do?

3843
04:14:29,620 --> 04:14:34,358
LIAM: I use Divine Sense and feel for undead. 60
feet.

3844
04:14:34,358 --> 04:14:38,002
MATT: You sense around. No undead in the 60-foot
radius.

3845
04:14:38,002 --> 04:14:41,115
LAURA: Does this feel like it might be Delilah's
room? Her chamber?

3846
04:14:41,115 --> 04:14:42,688
MATT: You don't know.

3847
04:14:42,688 --> 04:14:49,358
TALIESIN: From where I am, can I recognize any of
the book titles? Any of it?

3848
04:14:49,358 --> 04:14:53,181
MATT: From where you are now? You can't even see.
It's too far away.

3849
04:14:53,181 --> 04:14:57,956
LAURA: Is there any traps in this room?

3850
04:14:57,956 --> 04:14:59,392
MATT: You can check for traps.

3851
04:14:59,392 --> 04:15:00,378
LIAM: Fan out.

3852
04:15:00,378 --> 04:15:01,450
JOE: Can you sense Vecna?

3853
04:15:01,450 --> 04:15:02,533
TALIESIN: Yes. If Vecna moves, we will know.

3854
04:15:02,533 --> 04:15:03,621
LAURA: What is that? Investigation?

3855
04:15:03,621 --> 04:15:04,567
MATT: Investigation.

3856
04:15:04,567 --> 04:15:05,436
LIAM: 24 for me.

3857
04:15:05,436 --> 04:15:06,297
LAURA: 14 for me.

3858
04:15:06,297 --> 04:15:12,318
MATT: Okay. I mean, there's symbols across the
ground here, but they seem pretty inert. Three of

3859
04:15:12,318 --> 04:15:17,905
the circles in the center of the chamber appear to
be ready to trigger. By proximity. A five-foot

3860
04:15:17,905 --> 04:15:19,099
proximity.

3861
04:15:19,099 --> 04:15:21,087
LIAM: Where's the exit to this room?

3862
04:15:21,087 --> 04:15:28,168
MATT: It's across the way, around the outside of
the tower wall, so you can follow along.

3863
04:15:28,168 --> 04:15:29,732
LIAM: We can go around the edge.

3864
04:15:29,732 --> 04:15:32,789
MATT: Most of you can. It's a very tight walk to
get through. You have a few large individuals.

3865
04:15:32,789 --> 04:15:37,388
LIAM: What's making that so tight? Is there one
trap that's making it so tight, or all of them?

3866
04:15:37,388 --> 04:15:43,256
MATT: There are three large circles that overlap
with each other that are triggerable, and then

3867
04:15:43,256 --> 04:15:48,194
there are three inert ones that overlap. It's like
a series of Venn diagrams.

3868
04:15:48,194 --> 04:15:49,651
LIAM: Did they seem arcane in nature?

3869
04:15:49,651 --> 04:15:50,817
MATT: Yes, they do.

3870
04:15:50,817 --> 04:15:52,606
LIAM: Do I have a shot in hell? Of disarming
them?

3871
04:15:52,606 --> 04:15:57,660
TRAVIS: I take out the Immovable Rod and have it
in my hand.

3872
04:15:57,660 --> 04:15:59,189
MATT: Okay. Make an intelligence check.

3873
04:15:59,189 --> 04:16:04,792
LIAM: Natural 20.

3874
04:16:04,792 --> 04:16:10,103
MATT: These traps are far beyond your
understanding to disable.

3875
04:16:10,103 --> 04:16:12,102
LIAM: Okay, okay.

3876
04:16:12,102 --> 04:16:14,726
MATT: You glance at these and go, "Oh, this is
bad."

3877
04:16:14,726 --> 04:16:16,047
TRAVIS: We would need Dispels.

3878
04:16:16,047 --> 04:16:25,938
LAURA: What if we go-- no, the people that are
small go around. I'll bamf Trinket out on one

3879
04:16:25,938 --> 04:16:31,440
side, put Grog in, go back, put Arkhan in, go
back? We work our way around the runes.

3880
04:16:31,440 --> 04:16:33,479
SAM: What about the zombies?

3881
04:16:33,479 --> 04:16:35,756
LAURA: The zombies are little. They can work their
way around.

3882
04:16:35,756 --> 04:16:37,459
SAM: No no, his slave zombies.

3883
04:16:37,459 --> 04:16:38,451
TALIESIN: They're little.

3884
04:16:38,451 --> 04:16:39,549
TRAVIS: His dead brother, and--

3885
04:16:39,549 --> 04:16:48,931
JOE: Aw man, I wasn't thinking about it until you
brought it up again! Like, I was actually in an

3886
04:16:48,931 --> 04:16:51,349
okay place!

3887
04:16:51,349 --> 04:16:53,341
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I thought, you know-- Got to
pay respect.

3888
04:16:53,341 --> 04:16:54,647
LAURA: Are you guys okay with this plan?

3889
04:16:54,647 --> 04:16:59,555
LIAM: (Marlon Brando voice) I could've been
somebody, Arkhan. Instead of a zombie. Because I am.

3890
04:16:59,555 --> 04:17:01,769
JOE: (Marlon Brando voice) Vander, pick up the
mic, boy, and hit me in the head with it.

3891
04:17:01,769 --> 04:17:08,984
MATT: I need everybody except for Arkhan and Grog
to go ahead and make a general dexterity check.

3892
04:17:08,984 --> 04:17:15,804
LAURA: Oh, fuck. I thought we would be able to
avoid it. Natural 20!

3893
04:17:15,804 --> 04:17:17,671
TALIESIN: 24.

3894
04:17:17,671 --> 04:17:18,544
MATT: Okay.

3895
04:17:18,544 --> 04:17:26,936
SAM: Scanlan Two is okay. He made a 17. Scanlan
One had a one.

3896
04:17:26,936 --> 04:17:29,435
MATT: Okay. So. What'd you get?

3897
04:17:29,435 --> 04:17:31,241
MARISHA: Oh, I had to roll?

3898
04:17:31,241 --> 04:17:32,841
MATT: Everybody except for Arkhan and--

3899
04:17:32,841 --> 04:17:36,790
MARISHA: Oh, everyone <i>but</i> for them! Dex save.

3900
04:17:36,790 --> 04:17:40,449
LIAM: Oh, who's near me? Could I retcon and say
that I'm--

3901
04:17:40,449 --> 04:17:42,072
MATT: Dexterity check. You add your dexterity
modifier.

3902
04:17:42,072 --> 04:17:43,524
LIAM: What did you get? You got a natural one?

3903
04:17:43,524 --> 04:17:44,656
MATT: Scanlan did, yeah.

3904
04:17:44,656 --> 04:17:50,373
LIAM: If I'm next to him, because I give plus two
to saves, does that futz with it?

3905
04:17:50,373 --> 04:17:54,952
MATT: It's not an ability check, it's a saving
throw. One is an auto-fail for a saving throw.

3906
04:17:54,952 --> 04:17:56,689
JOE: They weren't within ten feet of me, were
they?

3907
04:17:56,689 --> 04:18:01,275
MATT: No, next would have been partially across.
Because you couldn't get across, you're too wide.

3908
04:18:01,275 --> 04:18:02,697
JOE: Fair enough.

3909
04:18:02,697 --> 04:18:03,676
MARISHA: 13.

3910
04:18:03,676 --> 04:18:12,105
MATT: Okay, that's fine. And you got? A four?
Okay. So. As you guys are moving across, Scanlan

3911
04:18:12,105 --> 04:18:17,965
and Pike, you both are clustered next to each
other. Unfortunately, Pike begins to wobble. You

3912
04:18:17,965 --> 04:18:22,179
reach to grab her and pull her in, but the armored
weight is too strong and you both accidentally

3913
04:18:22,179 --> 04:18:27,611
step out of place. At which point, the glyph to
your left suddenly flares. You watch as, in a

3914
04:18:27,611 --> 04:18:37,182
flash of sudden arcane energy, a cage of
force-like power encompasses the both of you in a

3915
04:18:37,182 --> 04:18:45,418
cube. You see these bars of crackling energy
(lighting crackle) around. You're both currently

3916
04:18:45,418 --> 04:18:48,244
stuck within this arcane entrapment. The gnomes.

3917
04:18:48,244 --> 04:18:49,903
LAURA: Can Scanlan Two dispel that shit?

3918
04:18:49,903 --> 04:18:52,383
SAM: I don't know Dispel Magic.

3919
04:18:52,383 --> 04:18:53,687
MARISHA: Can you Dimension Door?

3920
04:18:53,687 --> 04:19:00,308
SAM: Good question. If only the person in here
with me was also of gnome size. Oh wait! She is.

3921
04:19:00,308 --> 04:19:01,901
We'll Dimension Door out.

3922
04:19:01,901 --> 04:19:06,246
LIAM: Do we want to try to get everyone else
across before you do that? Maybe it's a

3923
04:19:06,246 --> 04:19:07,447
one-time-only?

3924
04:19:07,447 --> 04:19:09,117
LAURA: Everybody else went already.

3925
04:19:09,117 --> 04:19:12,554
MATT: Well, they're currently blocking the path,
now, with this cage.

3926
04:19:12,554 --> 04:19:14,289
LIAM: Oh, okay. Well, I meant the necklace, but.

3927
04:19:14,289 --> 04:19:18,794
SAM: I don't know how this spell works. I hope it
works. We might get hit on the way out.

3928
04:19:18,794 --> 04:19:28,771
MATT: Okay. As you clasp Pike and complete the
incantation, I need you to make a charisma saving throw.

3929
04:19:28,771 --> 04:19:32,754
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy! Come on! Come on!

3930
04:19:32,754 --> 04:19:38,050
SAM: A charisma save? Is this magic?

3931
04:19:38,050 --> 04:19:40,856
MATT: It is.

3932
04:19:40,856 --> 04:19:42,040
SAM: Okay. 20.

3933
04:19:42,040 --> 04:19:45,869
MATT: 20? 20 will do it.

3934
04:19:45,869 --> 04:19:49,815
SAM: I've never had to make a charisma saving
throw before.

3935
04:19:49,815 --> 04:19:51,365
TALIESIN: You got very high.

3936
04:19:51,365 --> 04:20:00,418
MATT: So. As you grab her and you both begin to
transport outside of the cage, you feel the force

3937
04:20:00,418 --> 04:20:04,761
of it push back, but the nature of your innate
magical ability manages to puncture through that

3938
04:20:04,761 --> 04:20:09,962
threshold and then both of you reappear at the
opposite side, no worse for wear. The cage is

3939
04:20:09,962 --> 04:20:13,054
still present, though, and it's now blocking the
path across.

3940
04:20:13,054 --> 04:20:17,470
The rest of you get across fine. It's the gnomes that
got stuck, and now the two of you are

3941
04:20:17,538 --> 04:20:21,333
on the opposite end. You have 30 feet between you
and the opposite side, and that walkway

3942
04:20:21,333 --> 04:20:22,901
is entirely closed off.

3943
04:20:22,901 --> 04:20:24,498
JOE: We can do this.

3944
04:20:24,498 --> 04:20:28,210
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm not worried one bit.

3945
04:20:28,284 --> 04:20:30,228
SAM: Wait, did you switch your boots?

3946
04:20:30,228 --> 04:20:32,225
TRAVIS: I did!

3947
04:20:32,225 --> 04:20:33,826
LAURA: You can Spider Climb to the ceiling!

3948
04:20:33,826 --> 04:20:40,927
TRAVIS: Do you want to Cirque du Soleil this
thing? We'll hold arms and I'll walk on the

3949
04:20:40,927 --> 04:20:41,978
ceiling?

3950
04:20:41,978 --> 04:20:48,291
SAM: Two shirtless, hunky dudes holding each
other?! In crazy poses?

3951
04:20:48,291 --> 04:20:52,009
LIAM: Definitely take your armor off for this,
though. Definitely.

3952
04:20:52,009 --> 04:20:54,800
MARISHA: Not for any particular reason.

3953
04:20:54,800 --> 04:21:00,529
TALIESIN: We still have the pot. You could get
some oil and really make this work.

3954
04:21:00,529 --> 04:21:07,495
JOE: My answer to your question was-- Cut to.

3955
04:21:07,495 --> 04:21:15,061
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will walk up on the wall so that
I'm sticking out.

3956
04:21:15,061 --> 04:21:24,546
TALIESIN: That's a lot of powerful--

3957
04:21:24,546 --> 04:21:26,797
JOE: Oh, I have four fingers.

3958
04:21:26,797 --> 04:21:34,843
MATT: Okay. The force cage encompasses too much of
the wall space to go sideways, so you'll have to

3959
04:21:34,843 --> 04:21:37,021
go across the ceiling.

3960
04:21:37,021 --> 04:21:43,129
TRAVIS: Because I was inverted, <i>bullshit</i>. Top
Gun? Thank you.

3961
04:21:43,129 --> 04:21:50,072
MATT: As you climb the top and you pull, Arkhan,
you tuck your feet up underneath.

3962
04:21:50,072 --> 04:21:56,950
TRAVIS: Treat me like your fucking dragons--
French girl, whatever.

3963
04:21:56,950 --> 04:21:59,701
LIAM: Paint me like one of your chromatic girls.

3964
04:21:59,701 --> 04:22:08,907
JOE: You like volleyball, bro? Just thinking, if
we make it out of here, we should play some beach

3965
04:22:08,907 --> 04:22:10,208
volleyball some time.

3966
04:22:10,208 --> 04:22:14,147
TRAVIS: Hand wraps, get some aviators? It'd be
totally cool.

3967
04:22:14,147 --> 04:22:22,086
MATT: Could you both please make athletics checks
for me?

3968
04:22:22,086 --> 04:22:24,357
TRAVIS: I'm still raging.

3969
04:22:24,357 --> 04:22:30,282
MATT: Yeah, you've been raging this whole time.
You're the most intense spotter right now.

3970
04:22:30,282 --> 04:22:31,470
JOE: This is an athletics check?

3971
04:22:31,470 --> 04:22:35,010
MATT: Yes.

3972
04:22:35,010 --> 04:22:36,310
JOE: 22.

3973
04:22:36,310 --> 04:22:37,685
TRAVIS: 25.

3974
04:22:37,685 --> 04:22:46,139
MATT: Step by step, you carry the heavy, armored,
red-scaled dragonborn across the threshold of the

3975
04:22:46,139 --> 04:22:52,694
chamber. You release him and both safely come to
the opposite side of the laboratory.

3976
04:22:52,694 --> 04:22:57,543
LAURA: Good job, guys.

3977
04:22:57,543 --> 04:22:59,673
LIAM: Is it hot in here?

3978
04:22:59,673 --> 04:23:02,566
TRAVIS: Not a problem. What happened to you guys?

3979
04:23:02,566 --> 04:23:06,041
JOE: Did you guys see that?

3980
04:23:06,041 --> 04:23:10,216
SAM: Yes. We did.

3981
04:23:10,216 --> 04:23:12,764
MATT: You continue up the stairs?

3982
04:23:12,764 --> 04:23:14,145
ALL: Yes.

3983
04:23:14,145 --> 04:23:18,318
LIAM: Point of order. I know roughly how far Vecna
is, right? So I should be able to tell, as we're

3984
04:23:18,318 --> 04:23:25,763
getting closer, roughly how much distance? Halfway
up the tower, three quarters, et cetera?

3985
04:23:25,763 --> 04:23:30,538
MATT: You guys are, based on far you've climbed,
you're about halfway up the tower.

3986
04:23:30,538 --> 04:23:37,087
TALIESIN: I would like to do one thing before we
leave the room. I would like to take something,

3987
04:23:37,087 --> 04:23:39,199
set it on fire, and toss it on those books over
there.

3988
04:23:39,199 --> 04:23:40,992
LIAM: Oh, that's dark.

3989
04:23:40,992 --> 04:23:42,468
LAURA: Nice.

3990
04:23:42,468 --> 04:23:48,347
MARISHA: We're holding on our Freedom of Movement,
right? We decided that? Until we get higher?

3991
04:23:48,347 --> 04:23:50,940
LIAM: How long did it take us to get to this
point?

3992
04:23:50,940 --> 04:24:00,466
MATT: I'd say a little over ten minutes or so of
continuous climbing.

3993
04:24:00,466 --> 04:24:06,057
LIAM: Who knows what is above us. It could be
slower for the upper half.

3994
04:24:06,057 --> 04:24:09,086
SAM: Fire stays where it is, typically. It doesn't
move up.

3995
04:24:09,086 --> 04:24:11,195
LAURA: We're fine. I like it.

3996
04:24:11,195 --> 04:24:16,310
TALIESIN: There's nothing else to catch fire in
here. It'll be nice.

3997
04:24:16,310 --> 04:24:18,462
TRAVIS: Is there anything else to catch fire that
would travel upward toward us as we're climbing a

3998
04:24:18,462 --> 04:24:20,315
towering inferno?

3999
04:24:20,315 --> 04:24:24,500
MATT: It's a stone chamber.

4000
04:24:24,500 --> 04:24:25,916
SAM: Full of chemicals.

4001
04:24:25,916 --> 04:24:32,262
TALIESIN: It'll be noxious, but brief. I take a
torch. I actually have one last Whitestone seal

4002
04:24:32,262 --> 04:24:36,952
that's flash-powdered. Wrap it, light it, and toss
it on the counter.

4003
04:24:36,952 --> 04:24:42,377
MATT: Okay. It clatters and the torch burns. The
powder (flaring).

4004
04:24:42,377 --> 04:24:43,859
TALIESIN: That'll do. Walk away.

4005
04:24:43,859 --> 04:24:49,996
MATT: You guys continue up the next set of spiral
stairs, climbing higher and higher up Entropis.

4006
04:24:49,996 --> 04:24:55,049
You can see, every now and then, one of the
various vein-like cracks of energy that's holding

4007
04:24:55,049 --> 04:25:01,879
the tower together. You can glance out and see,
very obscured, movement in the distance. It's too

4008
04:25:01,879 --> 04:25:08,139
fractured; too much diffraction.

4009
04:25:08,139 --> 04:25:19,716
Continuing upward, you come to a second, or
another, floor. About four minutes of climbing.

4010
04:25:19,716 --> 04:25:27,190
This next half-chamber, you see dozens of sets of
chains and manacles affixed to the walls, where

4011
04:25:27,190 --> 04:25:35,821
tortured corpses are currently dangling from them,
left in pieces. The scent is terrible. Decay is strong.

4012
04:25:35,821 --> 04:25:40,844
LIAM: I cast Divine Sense. Undead.

4013
04:25:40,844 --> 04:25:44,249
MATT: No undead.

4014
04:25:44,249 --> 04:25:45,487
LIAM: Traps?

4015
04:25:45,487 --> 04:25:48,990
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

4016
04:25:48,990 --> 04:25:50,125
LIAM: 18.

4017
04:25:50,125 --> 04:25:53,114
MATT: Okay. No traps in this chamber.

4018
04:25:53,114 --> 04:25:55,538
TALIESIN: Do we recognize any of the corpses?

4019
04:25:55,538 --> 04:25:57,640
MATT: Make a perception check.

4020
04:25:57,640 --> 04:26:01,028
TALIESIN: I had to do it. Natural 20.

4021
04:26:01,028 --> 04:26:03,121
MARISHA: Oh no!

4022
04:26:03,121 --> 04:26:05,620
TALIESIN: I get to know. The rest of you don't get
to know.

4023
04:26:05,620 --> 04:26:07,467
MATT: Most of the corpses around here have been
mutilated to the point where it's hard to even

4024
04:26:07,467 --> 04:26:12,983
recognize. This was essentially a torture chamber.
This was a gathering information, this was a

4025
04:26:12,983 --> 04:26:18,967
point-making chamber. The ones you do see around
here, nothing catches your eye. One does seem

4026
04:26:18,967 --> 04:26:28,557
familiar. You look and see, and it's been a while,
but you remember the face of a Scalebearer Desona,

4027
04:26:28,557 --> 04:26:38,118
who traveled across the Ozmit Sea with you aboard
a skyship. Glancing around, the bodies appear to

4028
04:26:38,118 --> 04:26:45,007
have been cleaned of any useful items. This is
mainly a for-utility-and-fun chamber.

4029
04:26:45,007 --> 04:26:49,792
TRAVIS: Any weapons or items besides the chains
and manacles on the floor?

4030
04:26:49,792 --> 04:26:53,311
MATT: The room is clean.

4031
04:26:53,311 --> 04:26:58,653
LIAM: How far above us is Vecna?

4032
04:26:58,653 --> 04:27:00,473
MATT: About 120 feet.

4033
04:27:00,473 --> 04:27:02,327
LAURA: We should cast it now. We should do all of
our casting.

4034
04:27:02,391 --> 04:27:03,772
MARISHA: Okay.

4035
04:27:03,772 --> 04:27:06,555
LAURA: Now I invoke the Blessing of the
Dawnfather.

4036
04:27:06,555 --> 04:27:09,071
TRAVIS: Call it out.

4037
04:27:09,071 --> 04:27:10,844
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Pike.

4038
04:27:10,844 --> 04:27:12,701
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

4039
04:27:12,701 --> 04:27:17,297
MATT: Okay. Doing a round of what spells to who?

4040
04:27:17,297 --> 04:27:26,220
MARISHA: Freedom of Movement to Scanlan One,
myself, Vax.

4041
04:27:26,220 --> 04:27:28,555
MATT: So only three Freedoms of Movement?

4042
04:27:28,555 --> 04:27:31,496
SAM: That's all she has, right?

4043
04:27:31,496 --> 04:27:33,112
MARISHA: That's all I've got. From Keyleth.

4044
04:27:33,112 --> 04:27:34,457
MATT: From Keyleth, right. And then, Pike?

4045
04:27:34,457 --> 04:27:39,025
ASHLEY: Freedom of Movement on Vex, Grog, and
Pike.

4046
04:27:39,025 --> 04:27:41,351
LIAM: I'm putting the wings out now.

4047
04:27:41,351 --> 04:27:46,431
MATT: The raven wings emerge. Pike? You said you
were doing Death Ward?

4048
04:27:46,431 --> 04:27:49,467
LAURA: Oh yeah, she did it on Scanlan.

4049
04:27:49,467 --> 04:27:51,084
ASHLEY: Death Ward at a 5th-level.

4050
04:27:51,084 --> 04:27:53,673
MATT: Okay, so 5th slot's taken.

4051
04:27:53,673 --> 04:27:57,273
SAM: Scanlan will invoke the Blessing of the
Knowing Mistress.

4052
04:27:57,273 --> 04:28:07,507
MATT: You watch as the forehead space, where once
you had seen the briefly visible third eye of

4053
04:28:07,507 --> 04:28:15,858
Ioun, now emblazoned like a lantern light, this
bright purple eye. In that moment, you watch as

4054
04:28:15,858 --> 04:28:17,881
Scanlan's pupils turn to silver.

4055
04:28:17,881 --> 04:28:20,759
LAURA: Whoa! Are you still you?

4056
04:28:20,759 --> 04:28:26,944
SAM: I can't see anything! Everything's silver! Oh
god, I'm blind! I'm just kidding. I can see fine.

4057
04:28:26,944 --> 04:28:29,867
TALIESIN: I charge Diplomacy up.

4058
04:28:29,867 --> 04:28:31,512
ASHLEY: And I will invoke the Blessing of the
Everlight.

4059
04:28:31,512 --> 04:28:35,803
MATT: And with that, you watch as this bright
light emerges from the back of Pike's shoulders as

4060
04:28:35,803 --> 04:28:44,791
a familiar, but much more vibrant and strong set
of divine golden wings, not made of energy, but

4061
04:28:44,791 --> 04:28:55,885
visibly beautiful gold feathered wings expand from
her back. Your feet lift off the ground and

4062
04:28:55,885 --> 04:29:00,315
(whooshing). As the voice of Sarenrae whispers
into her ear, "I'm with you."

4063
04:29:00,315 --> 04:29:04,552
ASHLEY: (squealing) Okay! Thank you!

4064
04:29:04,552 --> 04:29:06,521
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out.

4065
04:29:06,521 --> 04:29:08,615
MATT: (bear noises)

4066
04:29:08,615 --> 04:29:10,458
LAURA: If you want to Polymorph him?

4067
04:29:10,458 --> 04:29:16,507
SAM: Now's the time? Polymorph only lasts-- is it
an hour or ten minutes? I've got to learn this.

4068
04:29:16,507 --> 04:29:23,506
MATT: Polymorph, I think, is an hour with
concentration. Could be wrong, but I think it is.

4069
04:29:23,506 --> 04:29:27,206
Do note, you still have another series of
staircases that are pretty tight.

4070
04:29:27,206 --> 04:29:29,104
LAURA: Okay, we should go up. We should keep
going.

4071
04:29:29,104 --> 04:29:32,900
LIAM: Also, I'm going to say this now, in advance.
It might not be possible, but if we get to a door,

4072
04:29:32,900 --> 04:29:39,079
I'm thinking ahead of time, if we think we're
about to step out, I want to cast Bless on the

4073
04:29:39,079 --> 04:29:44,798
three half-elves right before going out. That
might not be possible, but it's in my head to do it.

4074
04:29:44,798 --> 04:29:46,423
MATT: Okay, good to keep in mind.

4075
04:29:46,423 --> 04:29:47,800
JOE: We should send Delilah in first.

4076
04:29:47,800 --> 04:29:48,999
SAM: Yeah, sure.

4077
04:29:48,999 --> 04:29:50,312
MARISHA: That's actually a good idea.

4078
04:29:50,312 --> 04:29:58,450
SAM: Scanlan Two is going to dump a 3rd-level
spell into the Tome of Isolation to reveal the

4079
04:29:58,450 --> 04:30:02,486
hidden text. Is it only revealed to Scanlan Two,
or is it revealed to everyone?

4080
04:30:02,486 --> 04:30:14,387
MATT: Let me see the item again. Well, the text
remains for an hour, yep.

4081
04:30:14,387 --> 04:30:24,553
LIAM: You're blessed. If it happens, hashtag
blessed, a d4 rolled for every attack or saving throw.

4082
04:30:24,553 --> 04:30:36,344
MATT: Once the text is revealed, technically,
anybody with any sort of penchant for arcane

4083
04:30:36,344 --> 04:30:39,002
knowledge could attempt it, but you have the best
chance.

4084
04:30:39,002 --> 04:30:42,454
LAURA: So you don't need to do that.

4085
04:30:42,454 --> 04:30:45,326
SAM: No, I do need to, to reveal the text. It's
hidden otherwise.

4086
04:30:45,326 --> 04:30:51,079
MATT: Correct, but the text is revealed for an
hour. If, in theory, you were to fall, and the

4087
04:30:51,079 --> 04:30:54,780
book could be found--

4088
04:30:54,780 --> 04:30:58,873
TRAVIS: I got it. I'll pick it up and start
reading.

4089
04:30:58,873 --> 04:31:01,713
MATT: Yep. It's more difficult, but it's
possible.

4090
04:31:01,713 --> 04:31:04,328
SAM: I have a book I need to read.

4091
04:31:04,328 --> 04:31:09,843
MARISHA: It's possible, but (uncertain noise)? Is
what his face was?

4092
04:31:09,843 --> 04:31:14,733
MATT: Because he was the chosen of Ioun, he can
read without issue, but the text itself is still

4093
04:31:14,733 --> 04:31:16,529
very arcane in nature.

4094
04:31:16,529 --> 04:31:22,084
LAURA: He's the only one that can finish the
sealing.

4095
04:31:22,084 --> 04:31:37,735
MARISHA: Right. Then Keyleth turns to Vax:
Whatever happens, lest it be trite, stay with us.

4096
04:31:37,735 --> 04:31:44,238
Casts Guidance for the next minute, which gives
you 1d4 on ability checks.

4097
04:31:44,238 --> 04:31:46,044
LAURA: Right before we go out, you mean?

4098
04:31:46,044 --> 04:31:48,930
MARISHA: Yeah, before we move. Just for the start
of it.

4099
04:31:48,930 --> 04:31:55,038
MATT: You guys begin to climb up the next
staircase? All right. You're beginning to spiral

4100
04:31:55,038 --> 04:32:02,676
up the next length of it. You get about 80 or so
feet up before-- are you leading this charge

4101
04:32:02,676 --> 04:32:04,321
visibly?

4102
04:32:04,321 --> 04:32:08,429
TRAVIS: Actually, Delilah is.

4103
04:32:08,429 --> 04:32:11,701
MATT: You're sending Delilah ahead of you?

4104
04:32:11,701 --> 04:32:13,973
LAURA: When we get up to the top.

4105
04:32:13,973 --> 04:32:24,772
MATT: As you're coursing around the edge, the
stairs stop into another chamber. The chamber

4106
04:32:24,772 --> 04:32:25,938
levels off.

4107
04:32:25,938 --> 04:32:29,256
LIAM: Up so that we're seeing the edge of steps at
the top? All right, I'm stealthing.

4108
04:32:29,256 --> 04:32:31,149
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

4109
04:32:31,149 --> 04:32:33,090
JOE: Very quickly, Grog, give me another longsword
for zombie Vander.

4110
04:32:33,090 --> 04:32:34,437
TRAVIS: Last one I have. You got it.

4111
04:32:34,437 --> 04:32:36,288
LIAM: Are we Pass Without a Trace right now? 44.

4112
04:32:36,288 --> 04:32:43,515
MATT: 44? So you stealth up around the edge and
you see now, where once it was divided into two

4113
04:32:43,515 --> 04:32:49,828
chambers, it now seems the chambers converged once
more into a single room. It's not very big, and

4114
04:32:49,828 --> 04:32:56,284
the tower's been slowly tapering the higher up you
go. The room is fairly empty. You see a few vases

4115
04:32:56,284 --> 04:33:03,928
in the corners and some basic ancient decor.
Standing, not noticing you're there, you see three

4116
04:33:03,928 --> 04:33:12,739
figures in full dark armor. Similar to who you
fought in the ziggurat, or the one who was

4117
04:33:12,739 --> 04:33:14,414
guarding the tunnel that led up into Thar
Amphala.

4118
04:33:14,414 --> 04:33:16,515
LIAM: They don't look like the big kahuna, they
look like the underlings?

4119
04:33:16,515 --> 04:33:21,157
MATT: The underlings. You see them in the same
dark, horned armor. There's one that's humanoid

4120
04:33:21,157 --> 04:33:24,630
sized and one that looks to be halfling size. Or
two of them, halfling size.

4121
04:33:24,630 --> 04:33:30,110
LIAM: From my hidden position, I want to see if I
see any traps in the room.

4122
04:33:30,110 --> 04:33:34,542
MATT: Make an investigation check for the
immediate entry.

4123
04:33:34,542 --> 04:33:38,800
LIAM: I'm not entering. I want to do it from my
peeky spot.

4124
04:33:38,800 --> 04:33:45,065
MATT: For the immediate entry for what you can
see. You can't investigate from across the room.

4125
04:33:45,065 --> 04:33:47,173
TRAVIS: They're facing away from us?

4126
04:33:47,173 --> 04:33:48,702
MATT: They're not facing away, but they don't seem
to acknowledge his presence yet. They don't see him.

4127
04:33:48,702 --> 04:33:52,993
LIAM: Yeah. 23 for investigation.

4128
04:33:52,993 --> 04:33:57,055
MATT: You don't see any traps in the immediate
vicinity of the room.

4129
04:33:57,055 --> 04:34:03,723
LIAM: So what I'm going to do is slowly back down
to the party, relate what I just saw. Three of

4130
04:34:03,723 --> 04:34:05,388
them. What do we do?

4131
04:34:05,388 --> 04:34:07,054
SAM: Standard undead?

4132
04:34:07,054 --> 04:34:09,703
LAURA: No, they're death knights.

4133
04:34:09,703 --> 04:34:12,958
MATT: They're not death knights.

4134
04:34:12,958 --> 04:34:19,055
LIAM: They're dudes in armor. They're lackeys.

4135
04:34:19,055 --> 04:34:21,948
TALIESIN: Are they humans or undead?

4136
04:34:21,948 --> 04:34:24,718
MATT: Can't tell. Fully armored.

4137
04:34:24,718 --> 04:34:26,271
JOE: How far up the stairs?

4138
04:34:26,271 --> 04:34:30,395
MATT: From where you guys are right now, they're
about 30 feet around the way and then ten feet

4139
04:34:30,395 --> 04:34:31,574
into the chamber.

4140
04:34:31,574 --> 04:34:34,672
JOE: I'll Divine Sense, which is up to 60 feet.
Are they fiends, celestial, or undead?

4141
04:34:34,672 --> 04:34:36,366
MATT: Nope.

4142
04:34:36,366 --> 04:34:37,699
JOE: It looks like they're human.

4143
04:34:37,699 --> 04:34:45,832
LIAM: Is it difficult to use that silenced weapon
of yours?

4144
04:34:45,832 --> 04:34:56,084
TALIESIN: Once I use it, I've got ten minutes of
silence. I was curious that if I get close enough

4145
04:34:56,084 --> 04:35:04,109
to Vecna, he can't talk. I was hoping to save
that, because that might be a thing where we can

4146
04:35:04,109 --> 04:35:06,140
keep him from casting vocal spells.

4147
04:35:06,140 --> 04:35:09,141
MARISHA: Can we stealth around them and not fight
them at all?

4148
04:35:09,141 --> 04:35:14,098
LIAM: It's a small room. You and I can probably
handle two, but that leaves a third.

4149
04:35:14,098 --> 04:35:21,754
MATT: You see one staircase, one final staircase,
that winds around the corner. Actually, you

4150
04:35:21,754 --> 04:35:23,322
haven't seen it yet.

4151
04:35:23,322 --> 04:35:29,582
TRAVIS: There's no chance you could remove the
stone from the middle of the floor and have them fall?

4152
04:35:29,582 --> 04:35:32,250
MARISHA: That's what I was looking for. Can
Keyleth take a peek and see what's up?

4153
04:35:32,250 --> 04:35:37,657
MATT: Make a stealth check.

4154
04:35:37,657 --> 04:35:38,656
MARISHA: Yeah.

4155
04:35:38,656 --> 04:35:39,606
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

4156
04:35:39,606 --> 04:35:40,720
MARISHA: Do you still have that?

4157
04:35:40,720 --> 04:35:41,557
LIAM: Yeah.

4158
04:35:41,557 --> 04:35:46,140
MARISHA: Dope. That's real good. 39.

4159
04:35:46,140 --> 04:35:54,683
MATT: 39? As you curl around the edge and glance
inside, you recognize this chamber. When you

4160
04:35:54,683 --> 04:36:01,374
scried in here previously, this was the chamber
that was being left by the death knight as he

4161
04:36:01,374 --> 04:36:05,921
ascended to the top of the tower. This is the last
stop.

4162
04:36:05,921 --> 04:36:09,356
MARISHA: (inarticulate yelling) Okay.

4163
04:36:09,356 --> 04:36:11,284
LAURA: Can you open up the floor underneath them?

4164
04:36:11,284 --> 04:36:14,285
MARISHA: Does it look like the floor opens?

4165
04:36:14,285 --> 04:36:16,273
MATT: It doesn't look like it's a trap door or
anything.

4166
04:36:16,273 --> 04:36:19,854
LAURA: It's stone. Could you open the floor and
let them fall?

4167
04:36:19,854 --> 04:36:28,611
LIAM: Could Stubby and I each target one and you
yank one into the ground simultaneously? Can you

4168
04:36:28,611 --> 04:36:30,394
do that right now?

4169
04:36:30,394 --> 04:36:32,603
SAM: I could hold one.

4170
04:36:32,603 --> 04:36:38,152
TALIESIN: Let's have you two take some out and
send the big guys in.

4171
04:36:38,152 --> 04:36:41,238
MARISHA: It's worked stone.

4172
04:36:41,238 --> 04:36:42,959
MATT: It's all worked stone. It's all very
carved.

4173
04:36:42,959 --> 04:36:44,813
SAM: I could hold one. Paralyze one of them.

4174
04:36:44,813 --> 04:36:52,949
TRAVIS: If we don't think the room or the setup
will fuck us up, the big boys can go in and

4175
04:36:52,949 --> 04:36:57,091
probably handle it. Or we can follow your
attacks.

4176
04:36:57,091 --> 04:37:02,630
LIAM: We don't want to create a stir. We might, so
it's better that we do two quietly and leave one

4177
04:37:02,630 --> 04:37:06,465
left. Can you throw your fucking Manners ball at
the third?

4178
04:37:06,465 --> 04:37:11,595
TALIESIN: It's better against weaker opponents.

4179
04:37:11,595 --> 04:37:14,274
LAURA: It's a thin staircase. Three people won't
be able to attack at once.

4180
04:37:14,274 --> 04:37:16,095
TALIESIN: I'll have ten minutes of silence.

4181
04:37:16,095 --> 04:37:18,059
MATT: Two at most would be able to strike at
once.

4182
04:37:18,059 --> 04:37:23,581
LAURA: So you and me go up, sneak attack, fall
back and let somebody run in and take it out. Yeah?

4183
04:37:23,581 --> 04:37:25,643
LIAM: Yeah, so who's going in?

4184
04:37:25,643 --> 04:37:29,217
MATT: You have the taller one in the center and
the two smaller ones flanking.

4185
04:37:29,217 --> 04:37:31,139
LAURA: We'll take the smaller ones.

4186
04:37:31,139 --> 04:37:33,167
TRAVIS: I would send in the dragonborn, because
they're all alive.

4187
04:37:33,167 --> 04:37:34,607
JOE: Yeah.

4188
04:37:34,607 --> 04:37:38,045
LAURA: Get ready to fight once we take the two
out.

4189
04:37:38,045 --> 04:37:42,379
LIAM: Tell me again, the three that are in this
room?

4190
04:37:42,379 --> 04:37:46,067
MATT: There's a human-sized one in the center and
two halfling-sized ones on either side.

4191
04:37:46,067 --> 04:37:49,379
TRAVIS: Jocks Machina does not get hazed.

4192
04:37:49,379 --> 04:37:55,048
JOE: Stop bullying Jocks Machina!

4193
04:37:55,048 --> 04:38:01,046
LIAM: Arkhan, we're going to handle the small.
Right after, you'll handle the tall.

4194
04:38:01,046 --> 04:38:03,652
JOE: Sounds good to me.

4195
04:38:03,652 --> 04:38:07,170
LAURA: We sneak up. Is it auto-crit if it's a
sneak attack?

4196
04:38:07,170 --> 04:38:08,549
MATT: If they're surprised.

4197
04:38:08,549 --> 04:38:11,497
LAURA: Okay, are they surprised?

4198
04:38:11,497 --> 04:38:14,256
LIAM: I stealthed. You have to stealth, right?

4199
04:38:14,256 --> 04:38:16,760
MATT: You have to stealth.

4200
04:38:16,760 --> 04:38:18,826
LAURA: Okay, 29.

4201
04:38:18,826 --> 04:38:24,599
LIAM: I will go a split second before my sister.

4202
04:38:24,726 --> 04:38:28,997
MATT: Both of you guys curl up to the edge and you
see the three of them. What are you doing?

4203
04:38:28,997 --> 04:38:31,664
LAURA: We're attacking the two smallest.

4204
04:38:31,664 --> 04:38:32,995
LIAM: Throwing on the right, throwing on the
left.

4205
04:38:32,995 --> 04:38:35,112
MATT: You're attacking the one on the right, and
you're the one on the left. Go ahead and roll your

4206
04:38:35,112 --> 04:38:36,723
attacks.

4207
04:38:36,723 --> 04:38:38,197
LAURA: Is it auto-crit?

4208
04:38:38,197 --> 04:38:46,345
MATT: If it hits, it's an auto-crit, but you have
advantage on the attack because they don't know

4209
04:38:46,345 --> 04:38:47,443
you're there.

4210
04:38:47,443 --> 04:38:54,322
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 30 on the first hit.

4211
04:38:54,322 --> 04:38:55,469
MATT: That hits.

4212
04:38:55,469 --> 04:39:00,719
LIAM: They all hit. That's good. Four.

4213
04:39:00,719 --> 04:39:07,873
LAURA: Oh my god, I rolled four sixes! And a
five.

4214
04:39:07,873 --> 04:39:10,691
LIAM: I'm doing okay, too.

4215
04:39:10,691 --> 04:39:14,440
LAURA: 29 times two is what?

4216
04:39:14,440 --> 04:39:18,197
SAM: Both of you guys got big damage.

4217
04:39:18,197 --> 04:39:20,714
JOE: What is it? 29 times two?

4218
04:39:20,714 --> 04:39:21,850
MATT: That's 58.

4219
04:39:21,850 --> 04:39:24,051
LAURA: 58 plus eight, so 64. 66!

4220
04:39:24,051 --> 04:39:26,665
LIAM: 80 for the first.

4221
04:39:26,665 --> 04:39:28,827
LAURA: That's the first attack.

4222
04:39:28,827 --> 04:39:31,325
MATT: All right, so a second attack for each of
you.

4223
04:39:31,325 --> 04:39:34,682
LAURA: 19.

4224
04:39:34,682 --> 04:39:36,212
MATT: That hits.

4225
04:39:36,212 --> 04:39:39,056
LIAM: 12 for my second.

4226
04:39:39,056 --> 04:39:40,650
MATT: Does not hit.

4227
04:39:40,650 --> 04:39:44,119
LIAM: No, they all hit. All my attacks hit. 12
damage for the second.

4228
04:39:44,119 --> 04:39:46,187
MATT: Okay, what's the damage on the second one?

4229
04:39:46,187 --> 04:39:49,370
LAURA: 18 on the second.

4230
04:39:49,370 --> 04:39:54,534
MATT: Both of the armored ones on the side take
the hit and crumple, fall back, helmet falling

4231
04:39:54,595 --> 04:39:55,888
off. Unconscious.

4232
04:39:55,888 --> 04:39:58,048
LAURA: I immediately move to the side so he can
run through.

4233
04:39:58,048 --> 04:40:00,037
JOE: So the guy turns around? And I'm-- (whoosh)

4234
04:40:00,037 --> 04:40:05,186
MATT: They're still in the center of the chamber.
They're about 15 feet from the top of the stairs.

4235
04:40:05,186 --> 04:40:15,188
The two of you are going to rush in? Arkhan, you
rush in towards the one in the center, go for it.

4236
04:40:15,188 --> 04:40:16,682
SAM: Unleash everything.

4237
04:40:16,682 --> 04:40:25,305
JOE: I don't think I can reach. I don't think I'm
in range. Did you see that?

4238
04:40:25,305 --> 04:40:28,461
MATT: So what'd you roll?

4239
04:40:28,461 --> 04:40:34,900
SAM: Right as he runs, Scanlan says: Don't fuck
this up!

4240
04:40:34,900 --> 04:40:41,738
MATT: As they both drop, you rush up to the one in
the metal armor, who doesn't react to your

4241
04:40:41,738 --> 04:40:46,520
arrival, stands there staring at you as you rush
forward and swing. You hit the armor, but you hit

4242
04:40:46,520 --> 04:40:49,217
the edge of the blade, cleaves off doing no
impact.

4243
04:40:49,217 --> 04:40:55,944
LAURA: Does he move?

4244
04:40:55,944 --> 04:41:00,026
JOE: That's attack one. Okay, that's a 21.

4245
04:41:00,026 --> 04:41:01,362
MATT: 21 hits.

4246
04:41:01,362 --> 04:41:07,866
TALIESIN: That looked bad from this angle. Yeah, I
see it now! Holy cow.

4247
04:41:07,932 --> 04:41:11,310
JOE: He's not undead. He's not undead, is he?

4248
04:41:11,310 --> 04:41:13,023
MATT: He's not undead, nope.

4249
04:41:13,023 --> 04:41:26,062
JOE: Okay. Well, this is going to be weird, then.
Oh, that's not bad. That's 28.

4250
04:41:26,062 --> 04:41:32,812
MATT: 28, all right. You hack and the axe slides
into the front of the breast plate and as you pull

4251
04:41:32,812 --> 04:41:35,648
back, you see a gout of blood. He takes it not
reacting.

4252
04:41:35,648 --> 04:41:36,898
JOE: Just stands there?

4253
04:41:36,898 --> 04:41:39,911
TALIESIN: Maybe we shouldn't kill all of--

4254
04:41:39,911 --> 04:41:42,488
JOE: I would like to bonus action.

4255
04:41:42,488 --> 04:41:43,855
MATT: Okay.

4256
04:41:43,855 --> 04:41:48,474
JOE: No, I wouldn't. I'm not--

4257
04:41:48,474 --> 04:41:53,142
LAURA: Why isn't he moving? Does he have a helmet
on?

4258
04:41:53,142 --> 04:41:55,229
MATT: Yeah. The one standing has a helmet and the
two that fell, their helmets tumbled off as they

4259
04:41:55,229 --> 04:41:56,687
impacted and fell back.

4260
04:41:56,687 --> 04:41:59,199
ASHLEY: What do they look like up there when their
helmets came off?

4261
04:41:59,199 --> 04:42:00,942
LAURA: Oh no! Were they our friends?

4262
04:42:00,942 --> 04:42:03,946
JOE: What friends?

4263
04:42:03,946 --> 04:42:07,361
LAURA: Pull the helmet off. Arkhan, pull the
helmet off!

4264
04:42:07,361 --> 04:42:09,522
JOE: I pull the helmet off.

4265
04:42:09,522 --> 04:42:14,939
MATT: You pull the helmet off and you watch
immediately a bit of black, fuzzy facial hair from

4266
04:42:14,939 --> 04:42:22,867
underneath. As you reveal, you see darkened skin
and long black hair with a bit of colored makeup

4267
04:42:22,867 --> 04:42:30,131
under the eyes and a metal band across the
forehead, looking ahead, unmoving, unflinching,

4268
04:42:30,131 --> 04:42:33,112
locked in place staring past you.

4269
04:42:33,112 --> 04:42:36,720
LAURA: Is it Gilmore?

4270
04:42:36,720 --> 04:42:40,430
MATT: You glance up, and it's Gilmore standing in
the middle of the room.

4271
04:42:40,430 --> 04:42:42,670
LAURA: We killed the two--

4272
04:42:42,670 --> 04:42:44,674
TRAVIS: No, we don't know anything yet.

4273
04:42:44,674 --> 04:42:52,996
JOE: I command zombie Delilah and zombie Vander to
go to the heads and take the helmets off the two

4274
04:42:52,996 --> 04:42:54,566
heads on the ground.

4275
04:42:54,566 --> 04:43:00,529
MATT: The helmets are partially off, so it's easy
enough to slip the helms off. To the left, it was

4276
04:43:00,529 --> 04:43:07,269
less of a halfling and more of a younger girl.
Jammed into the armor and a little taller than the

4277
04:43:07,269 --> 04:43:13,422
other, you can see brown hair with a shock of
white in it currently laying back, unmoving and

4278
04:43:13,505 --> 04:43:23,222
bleeding out. The other one looks to be
specifically gnomish, short brown hair and eyes

4279
04:43:23,222 --> 04:43:25,280
wide on the ground.

4280
04:43:25,280 --> 04:43:28,221
SAM: (high-pitched) Is that my girl? Is that my
baby girl?

4281
04:43:28,221 --> 04:43:39,451
ASHLEY: I think it's an illusion. I'm hoping. I
don't know. I feel this can't be real.

4282
04:43:39,451 --> 04:43:41,398
SAM: It's my baby girl--

4283
04:43:41,398 --> 04:43:54,424
ASHLEY: I'm going in. Can I stand over one of the
bodies and do a perception check? A medicine check?

4284
04:43:54,424 --> 04:43:55,981
MATT: Make a medicine check.

4285
04:43:55,981 --> 04:44:03,483
TRAVIS: No, there's no way.

4286
04:44:03,483 --> 04:44:05,960
ASHLEY: 23.

4287
04:44:05,960 --> 04:44:13,541
MATT: 23? They're not illusions, and they are both
dead.

4288
04:44:13,541 --> 04:44:16,521
JOE: I cut the head off of the one in the middle.

4289
04:44:16,521 --> 04:44:19,024
LAURA: No, don't do it! Arkhan, don't!

4290
04:44:19,024 --> 04:44:22,725
ASHLEY: No! I stand in front of him and say: no!
Please don't!

4291
04:44:22,725 --> 04:44:25,977
MATT: They still have the bands. Each one of them
has this strange brass band across the head.

4292
04:44:25,977 --> 04:44:31,646
ASHLEY: I take my mace, and I slowly try to take
one of the bands off.

4293
04:44:31,646 --> 04:44:33,982
MATT: You take it off the head of one of the two
dead?

4294
04:44:33,982 --> 04:44:36,021
ASHLEY: Yeah, but not touching it, scraping it
off.

4295
04:44:36,021 --> 04:44:37,242
MATT: It slides off.

4296
04:44:37,242 --> 04:44:41,156
ASHLEY: Does anything happen?

4297
04:44:41,156 --> 04:44:43,784
LAURA: Can we cast Revivify on them?

4298
04:44:43,784 --> 04:44:48,539
TRAVIS: Don't do that.

4299
04:44:48,539 --> 04:44:49,616
SAM: Yeah, do that.

4300
04:44:49,616 --> 04:44:51,022
LAURA: Who is it? Who are they for sure?

4301
04:44:51,022 --> 04:44:52,762
MATT: It is Kaylie and Cassandra.

4302
04:44:52,762 --> 04:44:54,485
LAURA: It's Kaylie and Cassandra?

4303
04:44:54,485 --> 04:44:58,326
SAM: Revivify them. Take the bands off and
Revivify them.

4304
04:44:58,326 --> 04:45:01,874
TALIESIN: What is the band, before we do
anything?

4305
04:45:01,874 --> 04:45:04,794
SAM: Take it off of Gilmore. He's still alive.

4306
04:45:04,794 --> 04:45:06,363
TALIESIN: This may kill him.

4307
04:45:06,363 --> 04:45:08,392
MATT: No, she took it off one of the front.

4308
04:45:08,392 --> 04:45:10,001
ASHLEY: Does Gilmore look like he's still alive?

4309
04:45:10,001 --> 04:45:12,246
MATT: He's wounded, but he's still alive and
staring forward.

4310
04:45:12,246 --> 04:45:13,511
ASHLEY: I'll do the same thing.

4311
04:45:13,511 --> 04:45:20,445
MATT: You pull the band off, and the eyes flicker
for a second. (panting) "What happened? Where am

4312
04:45:20,445 --> 04:45:22,230
"I? How--"

4313
04:45:22,230 --> 04:45:24,046
JOE: I pull the axe back.

4314
04:45:24,046 --> 04:45:29,017
MATT: "What happened?"

4315
04:45:29,017 --> 04:45:32,638
MARISHA: He doesn't know.

4316
04:45:32,638 --> 04:45:34,918
SAM: Save her. Right now.

4317
04:45:34,918 --> 04:45:37,532
JOE: I put my hand up over his mouth.

4318
04:45:37,532 --> 04:45:40,341
TALIESIN: Take them.

4319
04:45:40,341 --> 04:45:42,150
ASHLEY: It's okay.

4320
04:45:42,150 --> 04:45:43,873
MATT: He looks down.

4321
04:45:43,873 --> 04:45:51,356
ASHLEY: I stand over Kaylie and I cast Revivify.

4322
04:45:51,356 --> 04:46:05,864
MATT: You see the eyes lull back, the stillness of
the body as you finish touching the body a warm

4323
04:46:05,864 --> 04:46:17,163
burst. (gasps) Breath comes back to her and she
starts coughing. Sits up and leans over, gasping.

4324
04:46:17,163 --> 04:46:18,978
SAM: I go, grab her, and hold her.

4325
04:46:18,978 --> 04:46:21,362
ASHLEY: I stand over Cassandra and I cast
Revivify.

4326
04:46:21,362 --> 04:46:30,007
SAM: These are big spells, aren't they?

4327
04:46:30,007 --> 04:46:37,087
MATT: As you reach out and touch her chest, the
brief moment of stillness leads as her eyes slowly

4328
04:46:37,087 --> 04:46:43,511
blink back, and begins breathing again.

4329
04:46:43,511 --> 04:46:45,957
TRAVIS: This is some Seven shit right here.

4330
04:46:45,957 --> 04:46:49,244
LAURA: That is so fucked up!

4331
04:46:49,244 --> 04:46:54,804
SAM: Shaun. Can you get them out of here?

4332
04:46:54,804 --> 04:46:57,427
MATT: "Yes, I--"

4333
04:46:57,427 --> 04:47:03,431
LAURA: How did you get here? Is it really you?

4334
04:47:03,431 --> 04:47:05,298
LIAM: Do you remember anything, Shaun?

4335
04:47:05,298 --> 04:47:07,844
MARISHA: Anything that can help us?

4336
04:47:07,844 --> 04:47:15,836
MATT: "I was in my workshop, and there was a flash
of light. A doorway opened, and it pulled me

4337
04:47:15,836 --> 04:47:17,393
"through and--"

4338
04:47:17,393 --> 04:47:19,820
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check and see if it's
him?

4339
04:47:19,820 --> 04:47:21,111
MATT: Roll an insight check.

4340
04:47:21,111 --> 04:47:24,611
LIAM: I'm taking him by the cheeks. You're in a
very bad place. You're in a very bad place and

4341
04:47:24,611 --> 04:47:30,652
time. You need to get out of here. You need to
take these women and go downstairs and hide.

4342
04:47:30,652 --> 04:47:32,821
LAURA: 21.

4343
04:47:32,821 --> 04:47:35,390
MATT: 21? It's Shaun Gilmore.

4344
04:47:35,390 --> 04:47:41,013
LIAM: You are in no shape to do anything right
now. You need to take these two women and hide

4345
04:47:41,013 --> 04:47:42,319
downstairs. Do you hear me?

4346
04:47:42,319 --> 04:47:44,156
MATT: "Where are we? What's going on?"

4347
04:47:44,156 --> 04:47:45,716
LIAM: There's no time to explain.

4348
04:47:45,716 --> 04:47:49,532
MARISHA: We're in the tower of Entropis. We're on
the back of a titan. Try to get them as far away

4349
04:47:49,532 --> 04:47:52,709
from here as possible. Vasselheim is an hour
away.

4350
04:47:52,709 --> 04:47:55,243
LAURA: Or you can fight with us.

4351
04:47:55,243 --> 04:48:01,114
LIAM: No. His head is not where it needs to be.

4352
04:48:01,114 --> 04:48:08,165
MATT: "Wait. So if we're in-- We're near
Vasselheim? What's Entropis?"

4353
04:48:08,165 --> 04:48:13,103
MARISHA: No, we're in Thar Amphala. It's been
teleported to the back of a titan, which is a

4354
04:48:13,103 --> 04:48:18,049
giant mountain, which is what we're on. It's from
the Shadowfell. You just have to get away!

4355
04:48:18,049 --> 04:48:21,749
LAURA: We're 15 feet below Vecna. He's right above
us.

4356
04:48:21,749 --> 04:48:23,484
MATT: "Then what are you going to do?"

4357
04:48:23,484 --> 04:48:24,683
LAURA: We're going to fight him.

4358
04:48:24,683 --> 04:48:26,638
MARISHA: And you're going to go away.

4359
04:48:26,638 --> 04:48:39,885
LIAM: In 30 minutes, we could all be dead. But if
we have any chance-- You three need to not be

4360
04:48:39,885 --> 04:48:42,140
here. You need to go down now.

4361
04:48:42,140 --> 04:48:49,037
MATT: "I can get the three of us away. I can
teleport us. It's the maximum of what I can do."

4362
04:48:49,037 --> 04:48:54,664
MARISHA: J'mon Sa Ord is here, the Slayer's Take
has probably been vastly compromised. Just get out

4363
04:48:54,664 --> 04:48:59,213
of here. Get to the woods. Scanlan's right.

4364
04:48:59,213 --> 04:49:03,536
MATT: "I can probably take us back to Emon. Why
even stay here?"

4365
04:49:03,536 --> 04:49:05,152
MARISHA: Then go! Go!

4366
04:49:05,152 --> 04:49:10,271
MATT: "I'll do that. You're going to fight this
Vecna?"

4367
04:49:10,271 --> 04:49:14,385
TALIESIN: I hate to even ask, but is there
anything you can do and still--?

4368
04:49:14,385 --> 04:49:22,773
MATT: "If we make it quick."

4369
04:49:22,773 --> 04:49:25,473
TRAVIS: I'd almost rather him stay and fight.

4370
04:49:25,473 --> 04:49:30,144
SAM: No! He's got to get them away. They're at one
hit point each!

4371
04:49:30,144 --> 04:49:42,042
MATT: "If you can make this quick, I can leave you
with some intense adrenaline, my friend."

4372
04:49:42,042 --> 04:49:43,331
TRAVIS: Me?

4373
04:49:43,331 --> 04:49:44,570
MATT: "Yes."

4374
04:49:44,570 --> 04:49:48,626
TRAVIS: I'm a fan of adrenaline.

4375
04:49:48,626 --> 04:49:52,967
MATT: He looks around to the blood on the floor
and the two barely living women at his side and

4376
04:49:52,967 --> 04:50:01,627
says, "If the one you're going to fight is the one
that did this to me and them... Leave a scar in my

4377
04:50:01,627 --> 04:50:06,667
"name, if you don't mind. When it's done, maybe
carve a unicorn."

4378
04:50:06,667 --> 04:50:08,996
TRAVIS: With pleasure.

4379
04:50:08,996 --> 04:50:18,070
MATT: You begin to hear heavy footsteps coming up
the stairs behind you, heavy footfalls, and a

4380
04:50:18,070 --> 04:50:27,224
number of other footsteps heading up the tower
behind you. He goes and grabs the bodies close.

4381
04:50:27,224 --> 04:50:32,850
Glancing around you, up the stairway you see
emerging the death knight who joined you in the

4382
04:50:32,850 --> 04:50:34,170
fight against Vecna.

4383
04:50:34,170 --> 04:50:37,752
SAM: I grab Kaylie by the face and I say to her:
Goodbye.

4384
04:50:37,752 --> 04:50:43,829
MATT: The one that met you at the top of the tower
last time you fought Vecna emerges, looks across,

4385
04:50:43,829 --> 04:50:46,047
and begins to go for the blade.

4386
04:50:46,047 --> 04:50:47,615
JOE: I go straight for him.

4387
04:50:47,615 --> 04:50:50,400
MATT: You go straight for him?

4388
04:50:50,400 --> 04:50:52,309
JOE: With the death knight? Straight for him.

4389
04:50:52,309 --> 04:50:57,250
MATT: Gilmore reaches out to you and casts Haste
on you.

4390
04:50:57,250 --> 04:50:58,366
TRAVIS: Haste?!

4391
04:50:58,366 --> 04:51:00,614
(gasps)

4392
04:51:00,614 --> 04:51:02,318
MATT: "But it lasts a minute. Hurry!"

4393
04:51:02,318 --> 04:51:06,510
MARISHA: I hate to say this but Arkhan do you have
him?

4394
04:51:06,510 --> 04:51:08,519
JOE: Get upstairs! I'll hold him off!

4395
04:51:08,519 --> 04:51:09,836
MARISHA: Let's go!

4396
04:51:09,836 --> 04:51:18,517
LIAM: Bless. Shaun! It was an honor knowing you.

4397
04:51:18,517 --> 04:51:24,174
MATT: "It will be an honor knowing you all still."
Grabbing on to both of the girls and with a flash

4398
04:51:24,174 --> 04:51:29,901
of light, the three of them vanish. The death
knight has turned to reach out and goes to cast

4399
04:51:29,901 --> 04:51:34,279
something. Arkhan rushes up and slams the axe
across his arm, knocking it aside. You can see

4400
04:51:34,279 --> 04:51:39,111
now, behind them, other cultists and other things
begin to head up the stairs. But they're currently

4401
04:51:39,111 --> 04:51:42,349
being choked at this point where the death
knight's being held at the stairway where Arkhan

4402
04:51:42,349 --> 04:51:43,971
is stepping there.

4403
04:51:43,971 --> 04:51:48,361
JOE: Zombies are grabbing for his arms.

4404
04:51:48,361 --> 04:51:52,736
MATT: As Arkhan holds off, you guys head up
towards the top of the tower. That's where we're

4405
04:51:52,736 --> 04:51:54,100
going to pick up next week.

4406
04:51:54,100 --> 04:51:58,482
(screaming)

4407
04:51:58,482 --> 04:52:03,468
TRAVIS: What did you do?! You Kevin Spacey from
Seven mother fucker! What did you do?

4408
04:52:03,468 --> 04:52:13,912
MATT: When you revealed to a god how close and
dangerous you were last game, there were going to

4409
04:52:13,912 --> 04:52:15,193
be repercussions.

4410
04:52:15,193 --> 04:52:17,699
TRAVIS: (terrified laughter) Oh my god!

4411
04:52:17,699 --> 04:52:21,763
MATT: And he knows how to get to you. He knows
your secrets.

4412
04:52:21,763 --> 04:52:25,760
LIAM: This is a great game!

4413
04:52:25,760 --> 04:52:30,773
JOE: This is the most fun I've ever had!

4414
04:52:30,773 --> 04:52:34,089
(laughter)

4415
04:52:34,089 --> 04:52:43,448
MATT: I love you guys. We'll pick this up next
week for what will most likely be the final

4416
04:52:43,448 --> 04:52:44,447
battle.

4417
04:52:44,447 --> 04:52:46,079
SAM: Ashley, can you pipe in?

4418
04:52:46,079 --> 04:52:47,909
ASHLEY: I don't know yet. I don't know the
schedule.

4419
04:52:47,909 --> 04:52:53,673
MATT: If any of you are watching are from
Blindspot, find a way to not have her work

4420
04:52:53,673 --> 04:53:05,200
Thursday evening, please. That went a little
longer than we anticipated, but we're at the end

4421
04:53:05,200 --> 04:53:06,475
of the campaign.

4422
04:53:06,475 --> 04:53:10,075
LIAM: Joe Manganiello!

4423
04:53:10,075 --> 04:53:13,328
(cheering)

4424
04:53:13,328 --> 04:53:23,752
JOE: Jocks. We're here. Get used to it.

4425
04:53:23,752 --> 04:53:26,658
(laughter)

4426
04:53:26,658 --> 04:53:33,266
JOE: Thank you so much for having me.

4427
04:53:33,266 --> 04:53:35,385
MATT: Of course! Thanks for coming.

4428
04:53:35,385 --> 04:53:38,000
TALIESIN: I've been looking forward to this.

4429
04:53:38,000 --> 04:53:43,444
TRAVIS: You're welcome! Any time.

4430
04:53:43,444 --> 04:53:44,991
JOE: Tiamat: she ain't so bad.

4431
04:53:44,991 --> 04:53:55,443
MATT: Well, she's pretty fucking bad. But when
your goals are aligned, it can be useful. Well

4432
04:53:55,443 --> 04:53:59,814
guys, thank you for joining us for this extended
episode leading into the final fray of the

4433
04:53:59,814 --> 04:54:05,821
campaign. I'm so excited for next week.

4434
04:54:05,821 --> 04:54:12,777
TALIESIN: Everything's downhill from here. It'll
be super easy.

4435
04:54:12,777 --> 04:54:16,011
TRAVIS: You've got surprises and then you've got
<i>that shit.</i>

4436
04:54:16,011 --> 04:54:18,820
LIAM: That was fucked up.

4437
04:54:18,820 --> 04:54:26,510
TALIESIN: I was feeling weird about it.

4438
04:54:26,510 --> 04:54:31,041
JOE: I was going to cut his head off. I thought he
was some kind of sentinel. He was seeing through

4439
04:54:31,041 --> 04:54:33,740
his eyes or whatever. I was about to chop his head
off.

4440
04:54:33,740 --> 04:54:35,660
TRAVIS: Thank god you rolled a one.

4441
04:54:35,660 --> 04:54:39,843
JOE: That was the luckiest one.

4442
04:54:39,843 --> 04:54:41,693
MATT: That was a lucky fucking one, dude!

4443
04:54:41,693 --> 04:54:49,929
LIAM: Next campaign, we don't attack anybody! We
talk to everybody! Every NPC, every hot dog

4444
04:54:49,929 --> 04:54:53,238
vender, every lich! Talk!

4445
04:54:53,238 --> 04:54:59,115
MATT: That was a fucked-up tactic is what it was.

4446
04:54:59,115 --> 04:55:03,287
LIAM: Fucked up! You managed in the space of a
week to make the choke-out seem like child's play!

4447
04:55:03,287 --> 04:55:06,593
TALIESIN: You are a monster.

4448
04:55:06,593 --> 04:55:08,777
MATT: Vecna is a monster, guys.

4449
04:55:08,777 --> 04:55:10,577
TALIESIN: I'm so proud.

4450
04:55:10,577 --> 04:55:16,249
JOE: My undead brother I'm dragging around with
me! This is fucking so fucked up!

4451
04:55:16,249 --> 04:55:19,204
(laughter)

4452
04:55:19,204 --> 04:55:26,481
MATT: Well, thank you guys, hope you had a good
time. We'll see you guys next week. Have a

4453
04:55:26,481 --> 04:55:29,545
wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye!

4454
04:55:29,545 --> 04:55:31,463
MARISHA: Congrats to our t-shirt winners!

4455
04:55:31,463 --> 05:02:21,514
