1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:05,327
MATT: Welcome to Critical Role! Tonight, we return
from last week's rather tense cliffhanger of a

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:10,305
game. Really excited to get that underway. But for
those who this is your first time watching, this

3
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:14,109
is a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice
actors play Dungeons and Dragons. We roll dice,

4
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:19,043
and it's fun. So yeah, we're excited to have you.
Let's take it off with some announcements at the

5
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:25,946
top of the show for everyone. First and foremost,
we have under an hour until the sale for the

6
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:33,719
temporary special edition #IsItThursdayYet shirts
are no longer available. We're pushing in the

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,036
mid-900s, and see if we can hit a thousand before
the hour is up, guys. So if you haven't got one

8
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:44,232
and you're interested, we'll have information in
the chat for it. That's our hashtag Is It Thursday

9
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:52,517
Yet shirts soon will be gone forever. So grab one
if you want. Also, this marks the anniversary of

10
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:59,849
Team Hoomanism. You guys have been amazing since
the beginning of the whole community, through

11
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:04,669
Felicia and starting the whole stream thing. It's
been amazing to watch this whole community come

12
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:11,060
together, and part of that celebration for today
is go out there and tweet hashtag-- What's the

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,767
hashtag on this one, Luke?

14
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,296
LUKE: Hoomanism.

15
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:20,459
MATT: Look at that. #Hoomanism. That's pretty easy
to remember if you're not me. Write a story about

16
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,167
a good deed you did this week. Something that you
felt really good about, that you brought a little

17
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,398
more joy and positivity to the world around you,
or saw somebody else do. Just go ahead and tweet

18
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:31,235
with that hashtag, and at some point during
tonight's show we're going to be giving away one

19
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:37,316
of our Critical Role shirts that I'm modeling for
you, strangely, accidentally for this, but I

20
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:41,800
figure now you know what it looks like on a
relatively unfit male.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,267
TALIESIN: Bear not included.

22
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:50,186
MATT: Bear not included, for now. So go ahead and
guys, take a look at that, go ahead and put some

23
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:53,775
positive vibes out there in the twittersphere
about what you've experienced this year or done

24
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:58,442
this week, and see if you can get yourself a
shirt. I think it will be a lot of fun. Also,

25
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:03,194
wanted to remind everyone that we will be at New
York Comic Con, which will be October 10th and

26
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:08,103
11th. We'll be doing some cool events on Saturday
as Critical Role, doing some signings, and we're

27
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:12,366
trying to see what logistics we can do to have an
opportunity to see some of you guys who weren't

28
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,769
able to get passes. We'll have more information
coming up soon, hopefully. Because we'd love to be

29
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,449
able to see you guys who couldn't make it in the
actual convention. We'll figure something out. So

30
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:25,891
keep your eye on the Internet as things progress.
Also, let's see. Liam, if you want to go ahead?

31
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:30,276
LIAM: Yeah I just wanted to, I talked about this
last week. I'll probably talk about it next week,

32
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:35,642
but I wanted to encourage you guys if you haven't
already to go over to Joe Madureira's Kickstarter

33
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:42,017
for their Battle Chasers game, Battle Chasers:
Nightwar. Joe's a friend of mine; he's a comic

34
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:48,986
book legend, and is also a game developer and
artist, and I'm just a big fan, and so they're a

35
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:54,262
friend of the show, a lot of us here are in love
with Joe-- physically, not his art, just him

36
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,401
himself. He's a handsome man.

37
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:03,086
LAURA: He's got a hashtag thing going. Right. Now.
So #BattleChasers, too, that's an awesome thing.

38
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:08,590
LIAM: And they, they, hit their goal almost
immediately. They're just now making the game that

39
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,358
is going to be shinier because they're climbing
higher. But just go take a look, his art style is

40
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:20,542
unmatched, and the game is based, is an RPG based
in the JRPGs of our youth, and it's going to be

41
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,381
great. Go take a look.

42
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:28,957
MATT: Yeah. Thank you, Liam. Also, while our
esteemed Ashley Johnson has been away for some

43
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:32,809
time, and our cleric has been missing, she's been
doing cool stuff in New York, filming for the new

44
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:36,719
show Blindspot. Which just aired earlier this
week. So for those of you who want to catch our

45
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,761
awesome gnome cleric on the fancy big screen you
can go ahead and check out Blindspot, that airs

46
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,356
Monday nights on--

47
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,570
LAURA: NBC. At I think ten our time?

48
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,779
MATT: Probably. I should know this by how much
they've been promoting it everywhere. You can't

49
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:58,948
avoid the posters, so I should know. So yeah,
check that out. We're hoping that maybe she

50
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:03,937
manages to scoot some Critical Role references or
memorabilia onto the screen sometime. Fingers

51
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:10,207
crossed. Also, we're going to have at the
intermission today a really cool video that is a

52
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:19,238
presentation of when we visited and delivered the
esteemed check donation to 826LA that you guys

53
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,604
made possible. We'll have that shown at the break
today. It will give you a really clear idea of the

54
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:28,743
charity 826LA, what it looks like, the people that
are there, and a lot of the kids that are

55
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:34,594
involved, and what you've helped continue to promote
and help grow. So look forward to that at the

56
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:42,989
break. It's going to be good. Does anyone have
anything else they want to announce?

57
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:51,316
ORION: I have two quick announcements. Hello,
everyone. Greetings and salutations. My first

58
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:56,248
announcement is that I will be sitting on Zac's
face this whole game. I have found the pillow.

59
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:58,535
MARISHA: I'm sitting on his unicorn stomach.

60
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:01,217
TALIESIN: I've got the feet.

61
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,550
LAURA: Oh, is that what you've got?

62
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:14,245
MATT: I couldn't tell if he was blushing before or
after you revealed you were sitting on his face.

63
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:15,711
It's hard to tell.

64
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,161
ORION: I think it's after.

65
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:18,781
MATT: Yeah, probably. He's pretty cute.

66
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:26,130
ORION: I know this is because I farted already.
And everybody check out my

67
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,052
Twitch channel with my name.

68
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:37,287
MATT: There you go. All righty. We're waiting on
our esteemed gnome bard to arrive, due to traffic,

69
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:42,815
and when he does, we have a little present for
him, which we will reveal when he arrives. But in

70
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:49,041
the meantime, let's go ahead and kick things off
for tonight's episode of Critical Role.

71
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,644
TALIESIN: I'm not ready!

72
00:05:50,644 --> 00:06:58,905
[dramatic music]

73
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,757
MATT: And welcome back.

74
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,602
(laughter)

75
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:07,125
MATT: Oh, it is a well-oiled machine, Critical
Role.

76
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,749
TALIESIN: We all trade seats and then come back
really quickly.

77
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:16,852
MATT: It's pretty good. We started doing burpees
in between. No, I mean, we just burp.

78
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,854
LAURA: Basically, just burp a lot.

79
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:23,683
LIAM: Hey, the gnome is at the door. Can someone
let the gnome in?

80
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,626
MATT: Bring in the gnome!

81
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,965
TRAVIS: Do you desire a gnome, sire?

82
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,692
MATT: I would like the gnome brought before me.

83
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:34,752
TRAVIS: Bring the king a gnome! Make sure he is of
foul mouth and many a song.

84
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:37,074
LIAM: Oh, fetching the gnome!

85
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:43,657
TRAVIS: I assure you, sire, this gnome has many
songs, a very tiny instrument, and--

86
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:47,555
TALIESIN: I feel so dirty sitting on this pillow.
So comfy.

87
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:49,229
ORION: I like it.

88
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,237
LAURA: Does somebody have an extra pencil?

89
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,322
TALIESIN: Yeah.

90
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,748
LAURA: All I have is this broken one from Grog.

91
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,649
TRAVIS: In solidarity.

92
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,327
MATT: I appreciate that you brought it back.

93
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,488
TRAVIS: Nothing's changed.

94
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,064
MATT: No, it's a reminder. Yay!

95
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,316
(cheering)

96
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:07,215
TRAVIS: Sam, buddy! You made it.

97
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:14,340
SAM: Oh my gosh. Okay, I'd like to plug a few
things. No.

98
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,532
MATT: However, we do have a present for you.
Because there have been periods of time in which

99
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,654
you've complained about not having a proper stein
or mug to

100
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,812
match the rest of the group, we figure--

101
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:27,577
SAM: I've got a Google one.

102
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:32,974
MATT: Google one works fine. But thanks to some of
our wondrous, illustrious campmates we were with

103
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:38,555
at Burning Man, they gifted this unto us to gift
unto you,

104
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,304
as we felt it was fitting and size-appropriate.

105
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:47,631
SAM: Oh, yes! Yes, it makes me look cute!

106
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,622
(laughter)

107
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:55,786
LIAM: You have to measure that out in a regular
cup first, and then pour it in.

108
00:08:55,786 --> 00:09:01,050
TRAVIS: You could pour two whole drinks in there,
and it would be half an inch of liquid.

109
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,663
SAM: Wow, this thing's amazing!

110
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:05,369
MARISHA: So thanks, post-nuclear family.

111
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,523
MATT: Well done.

112
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,696
TRAVIS: (laughter) That is amazing.

113
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:11,555
SAM: It's a hotel ice thing.

114
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:14,186
MARISHA: Yeah, it's technically an ice bucket.

115
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,458
SAM: I want to fill it up right now.

116
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,860
LAURA: It's hiding your face.

117
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:36,423
MATT: All righty, so to get caught up on what has
transpired: the party, after traveling abroad in

118
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:45,057
the distant city of Vasselheim and the surrounding
lands, eventually returned to Emon, their central

119
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:51,052
hub city where they had their Greyskull Keep
constructed, to relax and take in a brief moment

120
00:09:51,052 --> 00:10:01,409
of respite before learning that the Briarwoods,
two individuals responsible for much darkness and

121
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:11,455
sadness in the history of Percy, were coming to
court in a week to feast and talk with Sovereign

122
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:15,830
Uriel Tal'Dorei. What are you doing?

123
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,338
TRAVIS: Lock it up! Jeez.

124
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:20,861
SAM: I poured a whole glass in there and it looks
like nothing!

125
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:27,909
MATT: You got to keep pouring. Upon hearing of the
Briarwoods' arrival within a week to discuss

126
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,433
political matters and enjoy a feast, of course the
members of Vox Machina, who are part of the

127
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:37,017
council in Tal'Dorei were invited. Within that
week, they made their various preparations, made

128
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:50,711
the various beard checks, made the various beard
shavings. It happened! And made their way to the

129
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:56,463
central palace at the Cloudtop District of Emon.
The Briarwoods arrived, a feast was put out.

130
00:10:56,463 --> 00:11:03,335
However, Percy went in under an illusion to look
like Vax over here, while Vax went invisible.

131
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:10,633
Everyone had formal attire on, weapons left at the
door, unarmored, dressed for the occasion.

132
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,592
SAM: Is that true, no armor?

133
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:15,049
MATT: Yeah, you guys were all dressed in formal
attire.

134
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,957
TRAVIS: We don't even have any weapons.

135
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,315
SAM: Do I need to subtract things from--?

136
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:27,310
TRAVIS: The recap makes it so much better. Just
lay it out.

137
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,984
MATT: So your weapons are at the door. They're not
on you at the moment.

138
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,601
LAURA: They're at the door? We left them at the
door?

139
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,838
MATT: Yeah, as part of the check-in process.

140
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,453
LIAM: Question, mine are on me, right?

141
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:41,691
MATT: Yeah. Because you went invisible and you
were under the approval of Seeker Asum.

142
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:44,956
LIAM: You just increased my chances by 2%. Thank
you.

143
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,517
LAURA: And Percy, your weapons are still on you
because you

144
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,047
already had an illusion on you, right?

145
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:55,843
MATT: Correct. The List is on him, his Pepperbox.
Bad News would be a bit difficult

146
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,437
for you to bring in here.

147
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,144
TALIESIN: Diplomacy would work out well, though.

148
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:06,604
MATT: Yeah, I think so. During the feast,
conversations were had, questions were raised and

149
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:15,135
information was extracted. Seeker Asum had
requested to have been met in the foyer by our

150
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:21,413
rogue here, who forgot and then decided to go on
his own upstairs following the Briarwoods to the

151
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:27,783
second floor where their guest room was set. He
distracted one of the guards with his serpent

152
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:31,346
belt, knocked out the other, entered the room and
found himself face to face

153
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,158
with the Briarwoods themselves.

154
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:37,012
LIAM: That did not lead to further hallway, in
fact that just led to a bedroom.

155
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:39,777
It ended right there.

156
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:46,177
MATT: Yeah. It went right into their guest room.
So after a brief discussion, a little bit of

157
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:51,959
awkwardness, you attempted to leave, but were
placed in a holding pattern by a Hold Person

158
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,400
spell, and had the two Briarwoods come up to you,
whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,277
about, you look delicious.

160
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:04,314
SAM: Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.

161
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:07,370
LIAM: They're kind of hot.

162
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,295
LAURA: Right? I mean, they are hot, right? So at
least there's that.

163
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,101
TRAVIS: What are we doing while this is
happening?

164
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,878
MATT: You guys are just now leaving the feast hall
at this period of time.

165
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,290
ORION: Where are we entering to?

166
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:24,766
MATT: A large foyer area. There's the main foyer
of the palace that splits off to two smaller

167
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:31,703
meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is
what leads to the Grand Hall. That's where you

168
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:34,019
guys were feasting. So you're making your way into
this--

169
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,429
TALIESIN: Hasum?

170
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:39,689
MATT: Asum? Seeker Asum, yes.

171
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:42,097
TALIESIN: Seeker Asum. Is he around? Do we see him
anywhere?

172
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,232
MATT: No.

173
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:50,666
SAM: Tell me this, DM. When my Invisibility spell
is broken, am I alerted? Do I know that?

174
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,558
Do I sense it?

175
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:59,713
MATT: The spell itself would dissipate, as it is a
concentration spell. It would be a, oh, spell's

176
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:08,126
gone. However, before we get to you guys. We have
more immediate business to attend to.

177
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,396
LIAM: Let's play, Matt. Let's play.

178
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:20,584
MATT: Vax. Your muscles lock in place, sweat
beginning to bead down the front of your forehead.

179
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:27,102
The realization of the immediate danger you put
yourself in washing over you. You can see across

180
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:34,491
the way, in the dark candlelit area of the room by
the canopy bed, is Lady Delilah Briarwood, hand

181
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:40,354
still out, smiling at you. Immediately to your
left shoulder is Lord Sylas Briarwood, who has

182
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:44,908
leaned in. He's actually pulling you away from the
door now. You're skidding across the ground

183
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:49,727
(dragging sound) as he shifts you, your legs
unable to actually move. As he pulls you forward,

184
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:58,240
the Lord whispers in your ear, "You are a curious
one, though not quite gifted with the silver

185
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:08,637
"tongue. Foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest
of the Briarwoods." For a moment, there's this

186
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:16,186
pause, this tension, the silence, and Delilah,
Lady Briarwood, puts her hand out further and

187
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:25,319
says, "Yet, my love, we are not here to make
enemies, nor raise suspicion. We are merely

188
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:32,409
"protecting ourselves from intrusion. Isn't that
right?" As she looks at you, and looks immediately

189
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:38,667
to your right, where you can feel the general
presence of Lord Briarwood. I need you to go ahead

190
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,556
and make another wisdom saving throw.

191
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:48,228
SAM: First roll. Not an unimportant one.

192
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,765
ORION: Not at all.

193
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:57,638
SAM: First roll of the night. Could kill Liam.

194
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,643
LAURA: No. That's good!

195
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,475
LIAM: That's 18.

196
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:05,750
TRAVIS: What was that? How much?

197
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,178
LIAM: I'm frozen!

198
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,584
LAURA: 18, he said.

199
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:16,592
MATT: You feel your muscles lax, and the sweat
that is still brimming across your face you feel

200
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:21,443
for the first time in these moments that seem to
stretch on forever. You have control of your body,

201
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:27,779
though you do feel the hand of Lord Briarwood
right on your shoulder, who, as you become

202
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,189
conscious of the fact that you are in control of
your physical form, his voice comes very heavily,

203
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:42,202
the bass kicking into your left ear. "Indeed. We
do require allies. I would have you prove

204
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:49,833
"friendship." And as he takes and moves the
shoulder away, you find your torso moving towards

205
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:59,989
him. You lock eyes with him, and he has this
knowing grin, his lids taut slightly with this

206
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:05,071
condescending sense of knowing. I need you to go
ahead and make another wisdom saving throw. This

207
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:08,823
is technically a charm effect, and you being a
half-elf, you do,

208
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,923
I believe, get advantage on those.

209
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:20,709
LIAM: That is a 21.

210
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:29,549
MATT: 21. You feel an extension of the sheer
unnatural force of charisma that attempts to

211
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:47,546
penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that Vax
holds to such a high esteem... However, you manage

212
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:53,012
to resist it and feel it wash over you as the
slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left

213
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:57,478
you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to
try.

214
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:04,252
SAM: Ooh. What was he trying? Who knows?

215
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:07,624
MATT: There's a brief moment as he looks you
over.

216
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:09,742
LIAM: What do you need?

217
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:14,119
MARISHA: Yes. That's so smart.

218
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,951
MATT: "There now. Be a good boy." Looks over. I
need you to make a deception check.

219
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:25,747
LIAM: Deception check. Okay, I'm using Luck to go
again.

220
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:29,301
MATT: Now you used a couple Luck points last
time.

221
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:34,742
LIAM: Yeah, I used one. I did a lot last game, but
we were over multiple days. I used one this day.

222
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:44,283
I'm about to use my second. (gagging noise) Okay,
this is deception?

223
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,583
MATT: Deception, yes.

224
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:50,436
LIAM: Ooh, that's not as great. That's a 15.

225
00:18:50,436 --> 00:19:03,414
MATT: 15, okay. Gives you a look. "Very well.
Apparently, the help was not very helpful." At

226
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:07,005
which point, you hear this fast knock at the door,
and you hear a voice go,

227
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:10,611
"Are you all right? Is everyone all right?" 
Behind the door.

228
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:16,818
At which point, Lady Briarwood just does this with
her finger, and the door swings open (creak) on

229
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:23,672
its own. The guard that ran after your belt is
standing there holding the groggy, just slightly

230
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:27,953
coming to second guard that you knocked out, and
as he pulls him towards the door, he looks over

231
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:31,742
and sees this, and he goes, drops him, and goes
for his weapon, and Lord Briarwood puts his hand

232
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:39,304
up, and goes, "Do not worry. We're just having a
conversation. Close the door. And get him up."

233
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:45,599
"Yes, not a worry sir." And he closes the door,
and you hear the scuffling behind the wood of him,

234
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,044
adjusting and waking up the guard who you had
clobbered in the side of the head, getting him to

235
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:56,621
consciousness. So they're both just looking you
over. Lord Briarwood's just walking back and

236
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:02,155
forth, keeping a very keen eye. He walks between
you and the door. As you stand there. Almost like

237
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:07,823
he's waiting for a reaction of some kind, for you
to initiate something.

238
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:20,401
LIAM: Thank you so much. Thank you so much! What
can I do to help? I'm pretty meager a servant, but

239
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:25,323
anything you need, whatever you need! Gosh, you
guys are good-looking.

240
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:35,344
(laughter)

241
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,410
LIAM: It isn't that, is it?

242
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:51,390
MATT: You hear a throaty chuckle from Lady
Briarwood across the way. (chuckles) "No, but what

243
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:57,020
"do you think, my love?" Lord Briarwood comes up
from behind, his hands on the back of your

244
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:06,240
shoulder, and says, "Like we said, you haven't the
gift of the silver tongue. But I applaud your effort."

245
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:14,299
LIAM: Well, my mom and dad said I'm a real good
speaker. They paid for a tutor? To teach me how to

246
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:25,029
talk. And it's worked out really well for me in my
life. So if you need an ambassador, or a butler

247
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:28,169
who talks? I could do that for you.

248
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:31,372
MATT: Lady Briarwood at this point steps a couple
steps closer. She's still about 15 feet from you.

249
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:38,397
He's right behind you. Right between you and the
door. She steps forward and looks over at her

250
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:49,154
husband again, and goes, "What do you think? Can
we trust him?" And Lord Briarwood leans forward,

251
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:56,208
and you can feel his chin peeking into your
peripheral vision. "I'm afraid not. It seems--"

252
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,328
LIAM: Well, here's the thing you need to know
about Uriel. And I take a step back.

253
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,571
MATT: Into him?

254
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,098
LIAM: No! Away.

255
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:04,566
MATT: He's between you and the door.

256
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:07,381
LIAM: Well, does he hold me if I turn? Well, I
just said that, right?

257
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,019
Here's the thing about Uriel.

258
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:13,151
MATT: As you go to move away, his arms that are on
your shoulder, tighten, flex,

259
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,707
and hold you in place.

260
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,804
LIAM: Oh, you don't want to know? Okay, I'll just
save that for later.

261
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:22,876
SAM: Roll for coy.

262
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:29,493
LIAM: Roll for what, Matt?

263
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:34,574
MATT: Since I don't know what you're going to say,
I'm going to say persuasion for this. Because I

264
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:36,032
don't know if it's a deception or not.

265
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,688
TRAVIS: Is the power out of the DM's hands for a
moment?

266
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,907
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to use my last Luck of the
day!

267
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,500
TRAVIS: The last one?

268
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,663
LIAM: Last Luck of the day.

269
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,058
LAURA: Oh my god.

270
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:53,002
LIAM: Okay, this is persuasion? That's 17.

271
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:57,074
TRAVIS: That was a big die.

272
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,161
LIAM: You could give me a-- never mind.

273
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:02,880
MATT: You want an inspiration?

274
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,368
LIAM: Huh? No.

275
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,786
MATT: (laughs) What are you asking for? What are
you begging from the DM?

276
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,885
LIAM: Yeah, no, that's why I said never mind.

277
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:10,842
TRAVIS: Is it begging or is it praying, at this
point?

278
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:19,635
MATT: No, I'll give inspiration when you've
goddamn earned it. As you say that looking at them

279
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:28,245
with this coy look of information about Uriel,
they both chuckle in unison. (chuckles) "Shall we?"

280
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:32,347
And she gives a nod and goes, "I think we
shall."

281
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,413
LIAM: Can I roll for initiative?

282
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,581
MATT: We're now rolling for initiative.

283
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,643
MARISHA: Fuck!

284
00:23:35,643 --> 00:23:42,023
TRAVIS: Does he have an earring?

285
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:43,601
LIAM: Yes.

286
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:54,429
MATT: So. Here you are, right there. Lord
Briarwood is behind you. Lady Briarwood is over

287
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,790
here by the edge of the bed. These are the two
windows, this is the layout of the room here. As

288
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:07,726
far as you are aware, there are two guards outside
the door, currently.

289
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:13,982
LIAM: My initiative can only be described as
fecal.

290
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:17,919
MATT: Oh no.

291
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,461
LAURA: It wasn't a one.

292
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,522
LIAM: Wasn't a one.

293
00:24:20,522 --> 00:24:23,331
MATT: One adjacent, is what you're telling me.

294
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:26,804
LIAM: Six, it was six. It comes close.

295
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:33,362
ORION: I thought you were out of there, man.

296
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:49,938
MATT: All right. So. For this, Delilah steps
forward, and you can see there's a slight flash of

297
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:54,724
bluish-purple arcane energy in her eyes and her
fingers, coalesce around, as she does, she draws

298
00:24:54,724 --> 00:25:02,035
her fingers up and you feel this sudden cold
pressure around your body. I need to pull out my

299
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,547
spells. I don't know what I'm doing here.

300
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:08,812
LIAM: Should I check my iPhone, too?

301
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:12,693
LAURA: He's pulling up his spells.

302
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:19,430
TALIESIN: He hasn't had time to memorize all the
ways he's going to fuck with you. There are that

303
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,496
many ways.

304
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:26,284
MATT: All right, so I need you to go ahead and make
a constitution saving throw, Vax.

305
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,694
LIAM: 19.

306
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:35,917
MATT: 19. All right. So as she does this you feel
all the flesh on your torso and around the neck

307
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:40,273
part of your body all of a sudden begin to dry and
crack as if your life force itself is beginning to

308
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:47,722
wither and be drawn out. It's the equivalent of a
plant drying out and dying very fast, but it's

309
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:51,015
your flesh instead. You go ahead and take--

310
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:57,094
MARISHA: Sounds like Blight or something.

311
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:10,741
MATT: You take 21 points of necrotic damage, and
she's going to go ahead and step this way. After

312
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:15,051
that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post
at the side of the bed and looks at you with this

313
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:26,014
grin. At that point as you tense from the pain,
Sylas immediately whips to one side and with an

314
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:30,650
unarmed claw attack, a giant fist is going to hit
you on the side of your torso. That is going to be

315
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,983
a 21 to hit.

316
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:34,213
LIAM: That hits.

317
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:43,568
MATT: All right. You take eight points of
bludgeoning damage as his fist socks you on the

318
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:49,198
inside of your chest area hitting the sternum, and
you feel like a slight pain crack sound as it hits

319
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:55,826
and impacts against the leather. As you pull
forward, with unnatural speed (whoosh) the hands

320
00:26:55,826 --> 00:27:05,727
are back on your shoulder and you hear this little
voice say, "Bon Appetit." That is going to be a 25

321
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:24,856
to hit. All right. Okay, you take six points of
piercing damage as suddenly you feel two extremely

322
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:32,374
sharp, warm prongs jut into the side of your neck,
and that same cold sensation you felt across your

323
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:37,837
torso all of a sudden begins to pull from the neck,
and you feel as if the very warm blood around your

324
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:45,247
throat begins to drain from it. You take an
additional 12 points of necrotic damage, and your

325
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,088
maximum hit points are currently reduced by 12.

326
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:51,120
MARISHA: Oh ho! They're sucking the life out of
you.

327
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,895
MATT: It's your turn.

328
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:57,388
LIAM: He's holding me, right?

329
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:05,580
MATT: Actually, this will be part of his unarmed
attack. No. He does not have you grappled,

330
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,352
currently. He's over the shoulders.

331
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:19,744
LIAM: Okay. As a bonus action I'm going to use
rogue's cunning action to disengage, which means

332
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:23,083
nobody can swipe at me if I run, okay.

333
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,013
MARISHA: (whispering) Jenga!

334
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:30,171
LIAM: There's a window. Last week, you said there
was a window to the courtyard.

335
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,710
MATT: There are two windows on each side of the
room there.

336
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:43,332
LIAM: Okay. I'm running straight at the window,
and as I run-- yeah, past them, and I don't go

337
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:51,111
anywhere near her, and I'm using dash, and I'm
leaping out the window and saying, jenga.

338
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:54,234
TRAVIS: Jenga!

339
00:28:54,234 --> 00:29:03,195
MATT: (window breaking) As you run past, you can
see there's this moment where it's almost like

340
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:08,859
they are letting it happen. There is no momentary
aggression or frustration to this as you dart and

341
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:16,521
(crashing) out the window falling from the second
story. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

342
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:21,110
LIAM: That is a 32.

343
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,291
MATT: Okay.

344
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,741
LIAM: Do I even stop running?

345
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:30,893
MATT: (chuckles) You hit the ground with a tumble,
and you get up and you continue to move forward.

346
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:39,089
So at this point you've pushed into the courtyard
now. You can see the cobblestone road that

347
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:43,092
surrounds the outskirts of the palace. There are a
few bits of light and you can see there is the

348
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:48,839
carriage they came in, horses still attached, and
the younger man who led them inside who was

349
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,900
driving the coach is napping on the front, who is
now looking over, spooked, at the sound of

350
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,767
shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground
around you. And that ends your turn. Everyone else,

351
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:04,200
you hear jenga whispered through those of you who
have the earrings on.

352
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,315
SAM: He's in trouble! Let's go!

353
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:08,570
MARISHA: What's going on?

354
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,157
TALIESIN: Now we hear shattering glass, don't we?

355
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,537
MATT: Not from this part of the palace. You're too
far away.

356
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:17,580
LAURA: I start running towards the door to grab
weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are

357
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,145
you? What's going on?

358
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:25,423
SAM: I'm by the bartender saying, I ordered a
large. Please, can I have a slightly larger one

359
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,000
please? What? Oh! Oh shit!

360
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,178
MARISHA: I'm going to go eagle, and I start
scouting the halls looking for him.

361
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,964
TALIESIN: I'm running with them towards the doors

362
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,042
LIAM: I don't know. Am I able to talk further?

363
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:48,427
MATT: That's about as much as you got out this
combat round because it was a very quick series.

364
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:51,331
It took all your effort to even get out of
that situation.

365
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:53,042
TRAVIS: She and I are booking it for the door.

366
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:56,491
MATT: So you guys go forward. You run towards the front
and the weapons are being held in this storage

367
00:30:56,491 --> 00:31:00,733
area off to the side that is used for storing
weaponry and armor for people who arrive and

368
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,106
shouldn't be wearing them in very social events.
So you guys head that way.

369
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,812
You're getting a big drink.

370
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:10,735
MARISHA: I'm heading to wherever I saw the
Briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving.

371
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,670
TALIESIN: Actually, did you turn into an eagle?
Can you carry me?

372
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,199
MARISHA: No, you're big. I can take the gnomes.

373
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,400
TALIESIN: That's fine; I need to get my gun.
anyway.

374
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,782
MATT: You burst through the hall and head up the
way. As you do, you can see some of the other

375
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:28,161
servants glance around, suddenly.

376
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:31,923
MARISHA: I poop on one of them as I go over.

377
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:38,593
MATT: As you you're gliding up the staircase and
onto the second floor, there are two servants. One

378
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:39,953
darts out of the way.

379
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:46,395
MARISHA: It's one of the Briarwoods' servants,
right? Oh, no. I want to save it for if I fly over

380
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:49,570
one of the Briarwoods. Never mind. It's fine.

381
00:31:49,570 --> 00:32:06,010
MATT: We'll let it go. So as you coast up,
releasing your avian payload on the stairs, you

382
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:12,934
can see, looking jarred and confused, a human
woman, brown hair, freckles, mousy-looking servant

383
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:17,364
looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of
her shoulder.

384
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:20,472
MARISHA: (caws) That's me saying sorry.

385
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:30,439
ORION: I see what's going on. You're flying? I
cast Fly on myself. I follow suit behind her, and

386
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:35,735
as I'm passing by the person she shat on, I cast
Prestidigitation on her. Sorry about that!

387
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:45,745
MATT: Okay, the Keyleth spatter vanishes through
arcane means. However, the servant begins to give

388
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:49,491
chase up the stairs after you guys. Not angrily,
just following to see where the action is going.

389
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:54,970
All right, you head over to meet up with them to grab your
weaponry. Although your weapon was probably on you.

390
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,324
TALIESIN: Bad News.

391
00:32:56,324 --> 00:33:01,508
MATT: So you go ahead and grab Bad News and pull
it off the side. That's your guys' action now, so

392
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:14,391
as you are out front, Lady Briarwood is going to
right at the window. Looks down for a second, and

393
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:20,608
I need you to make another wisdom saving throw.

394
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,541
LIAM: That's a 13.

395
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:29,505
MATT: 13? So as you get up and you say jenga. A
familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once

396
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:34,867
again lock into place and you fall over from the
momentum of the run, going face-down into the cold,

397
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:40,015
dew-covered grass in this courtyard area, unable to
move.

398
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,160
LIAM: (muffled) Fucking bitch!

399
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:52,671
MATT: In a similar dash fashion and leaping out of
the broken window that you left, Lord Briarwood

400
00:33:52,671 --> 00:34:01,115
(impact) onto the ground next to you. Three-point
landing, stands up over you with this grin. That

401
00:34:01,115 --> 00:34:12,044
will be his turn though. At this point in time,
one of the bookcases-- you hear this sound real

402
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:17,763
fast, this sound of wood being slammed open, and a
surprised noise. That's all you hear from your perspective

403
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:25,081
in the distance. All right, so as you guys get
your weapons you begin going where?

404
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:28,186
LAURA: I guess running towards the Briarwoods'
room.

405
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:33,257
MATT: Where you saw them leave? You head up the
stairway, following behind where you saw

406
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:35,876
Keyleth and Tiberius rush off to. Are you
following the rest of them?

407
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:50,474
SAM: Yeah. I put my mug down and I start little
leg waddling towards them. As I go, I'm going to

408
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:56,940
send a message. I use Message to-- who's the guy
who likes us?

409
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,202
LIAM: My name is Vax.

410
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:03,449
SAM: No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker
Asum?

411
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:12,392
MATT: Seeker Asum, with Message? I believe the
person has to be within visual range. Wait, no.

412
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:14,756
You can cast through solid objects if you're
familiar with the target and nobody on the

413
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:18,423
barrier. It's 120 foot, though. You don't know how
far he is. You could give it a shot.

414
00:35:18,423 --> 00:35:25,885
SAM: Okay, I say, something's gone awry. We may
need you right away.

415
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:30,194
MATT: The message is delivered out into the space.
Hopefully, it found its recipient.

416
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:34,452
LAURA: As I'm running towards the Briarwoods'
room, I start shouting Uriel! and grab a servant

417
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:41,044
and say, go find Uriel. Tell him there's enemies
within the gates, in the castle. Now!

418
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:49,780
MATT: "Yes, Lady Vex. Right away." Runs off. You
guys coast up the stairs. Right as you reach the

419
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,092
top of the hallway over here, you can see there
are two guards that are

420
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:54,726
currently standing at the door.

421
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:56,636
TRAVIS: I stay at the front door.

422
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:58,415
MARISHA: Is the door open?

423
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:07,141
MATT: The door is currently closed, but you're in
eagle form, so you're going to be doing like

424
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:15,196
eagles do. I'll say, you're about there because
you were a little bit ahead of them. Those are the

425
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:20,355
two guards right there. At this point now, as this
is happening,

426
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:27,897
I need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative.

427
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,799
MARISHA: That's okay. Thanks, Percy. Ten.

428
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,054
ORION: 17.

429
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:42,175
MATT: And Keyleth? Keyleth, you got ten, you
said?

430
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,565
MARISHA: Yes.

431
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:53,851
MATT: Okay, so after that current circumstance,
that brings us-- as they're rushing up, you would

432
00:36:53,851 --> 00:37:00,571
be finishing off the last round, so you 
can make another wisdom check.

433
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:02,115
LIAM: I failed it.

434
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:07,724
MATT: Okay. You can just see the little bit of
moonlight up in the sky. It is this ominous image

435
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:12,074
of not knowing if your friends are coming, not
knowing what's happening. All you know is you

436
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:15,561
cannot move your physical form, and looming over
you is Lord Briarwood, standing and beginning to

437
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:22,251
move in to kneel. That will end your turn. All
right, that brings us to the top of the round.

438
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:39,008
This will bring us to Lady Delilah, who is now
going to step out of the glass, leap down, try to

439
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:50,716
catch herself. And falls flat on her ass. Smacks
down, (grunts). Gets herself up from the ground.

440
00:37:50,716 --> 00:38:02,022
Yeah, she has to use the rest of her movement
getting back up from prone, at that point. She's

441
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:08,913
right there, but you see now, in the window above
her, a small humanoid figure. A familiar one that

442
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:15,732
was waiting for you earlier in the foyer, who
apparently was hiding inside one of the dressers

443
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:17,207
inside the room.

444
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:18,563
LAURA: Seeker!

445
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:25,957
MATT: He's there. Lady Briarwood is going to take
the rest of her turn. She has one action left.

446
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:42,785
With this, she looks over to you and says, "When
we mark a target, he does not escape, I'm afraid."

447
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:53,246
I'm going to see what this does. All right, I need
you to make another constitution saving throw.

448
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,986
LIAM: Nine.

449
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:58,725
LAURA: Start rolling different dice!

450
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:04,824
LIAM: The universe is random and doesn't care
about you and me.

451
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:09,420
MARISHA: Life lessons by Critical Role.

452
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,421
SAM: Stay in school, kids.

453
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:23,937
MATT: You take 34 points of necrotic damage.

454
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:30,636
LIAM: I'm unconscious. I haven't been knocked out
in ages.

455
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:37,251
MATT: You go unconscious, then when it comes back
to your next turn, you have to make a death saving

456
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,735
throw. If you fail three--

457
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:42,723
LIAM: Right, so it's only if it exceeds my hit
point maximum that I'm killed outright, so I'm

458
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:43,601
unconscious.

459
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:44,528
MATT: You are unconscious.

460
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:46,151
LIAM: Hey, guys. I'm unconscious.

461
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:50,448
MARISHA: So that means he never got his "I'm right
here" message out.

462
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:51,875
MATT: Nope.

463
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,777
LAURA: But we know he's in the room. That's where
we're all heading.

464
00:39:54,777 --> 00:40:02,085
MARISHA: Well, he's not in the room. He's in the
front yard, at this point. So we are heading to

465
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:03,252
the room.

466
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:13,654
LIAM: Wait. As that happens, and as my
consciousness fades away, I don't say anything,

467
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:25,594
but here's what I think in a split-second. I think
of my friends that I have spent so much time with.

468
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:46,315
I think of Keyleth, beautiful, walking under the
trees. I think of my twin sister as a young girl,

469
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:59,887
folding up linens with our mother. I think of my
sister as an adolescent in lessons, smarter than

470
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:14,365
me. I think of the woman she grew into. Hiking
over many, many, many miles together. My best

471
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:32,620
friend. My best friend, Vex'ahlia. And before I
can think no more, I say a prayer to Sarenrae to

472
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:39,713
watch over my friends and keep them safe.

473
00:41:39,713 --> 00:41:46,178
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

474
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,326
LIAM: Eight.

475
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:55,918
MATT: With that thought cast out, the darkness
swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you

476
00:41:55,918 --> 00:42:04,945
into the cold, wet grass on the floor of the
courtyard surrounding the palace. A small shiver

477
00:42:04,945 --> 00:42:11,741
runs down your spine, Vex: a feeling you haven't
felt before. A feeling of sudden and immediate

478
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:21,442
sourceless dread, and in that instant you know
that there is almost no time.

479
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:29,487
LAURA: Can I use Hunter's Mark and sense where
Lady Briarwood is at that moment?

480
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:36,081
MATT: Yeah, she is actually at this point, beyond
the palace walls. You can sense and knowing the

481
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:41,625
palace walls. You were expecting a second floor,
it's that direction but just outside the walls of

482
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,531
the palace. And you guys just got your weapons.

483
00:42:43,531 --> 00:42:45,270
LAURA: I take off running in that direction.

484
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,992
MATT: I'm going to have people who haven't rolled
initiative yet, go ahead and roll initiative so I

485
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:56,551
can put you on the timing chart here.

486
00:42:56,551 --> 00:43:04,101
Grog?

487
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:05,375
TRAVIS: 17.

488
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,065
MATT: 17, nice.

489
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:09,962
SAM: 17.

490
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,443
MATT: 17? Look at you guys.

491
00:43:12,443 --> 00:43:13,946
TALIESIN: 16.

492
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:23,238
LAURA: I hadn't rolled, actually, for that. I
hadn't rolled initiative yet. 18.

493
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:43,615
MATT: You guys are coming up into the hallway at
this point. Let's see. All right, Vex and Grog,

494
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:48,271
you rush out into the courtyard area, making your
way out of the front. Some of the guards can see

495
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:51,320
you dart out and they go to stop you, but they see
you going where they're going, they recognize you

496
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,164
and let you pass. So that will be for Scanlan,
Grog, and Vex'ahlia, your turn is making your way

497
00:43:57,164 --> 00:44:02,240
around the outside, using a full run action. You
haven't crested the outside of the palace yet. You

498
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,169
don't see anything, but you are starting to make
your way around the corner.

499
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:11,423
LAURA: Can I use my earring during that? I tell
Keyleth and Tiberius that I think they are outside

500
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:12,801
the palace walls.

501
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,032
ORION: Copy that.

502
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:15,506
SAM: Did I hear that?

503
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:17,892
MATT: Do you have your ear pieces on? Then yeah,
you would.

504
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:23,214
SAM: Then I don't run. I Dimension Door outside of
the palace wall.

505
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:28,703
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an intelligence
check. Roll a d20 and add your intelligence

506
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:30,715
modifier.

507
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:32,122
SAM: Not good. Oh, wait.

508
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:34,463
TRAVIS: Seeing how fast she's running, I go into a
rage.

509
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:39,246
SAM: Oh, wait. It says I have advantage on
intelligence saving throws. This is not a saving

510
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,321
throw. Then no, eight.

511
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:46,788
MATT: Eight? So you manage to Dimension Door--

512
00:44:46,788 --> 00:44:48,205
SAM: Into an outhouse!

513
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:55,368
MATT: As opposed to being directly outside,
because you haven't seen this part of the palace,

514
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:59,660
you're not really 100% visual range; you haven't
visited this side. You end up trying to come over

515
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,839
in this area. You end up appearing right up here
inside the room, looking at the window and you can

516
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,781
see down. Suddenly you look about this room. To
the left of you is Seeker Asum, who doesn't even

517
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:14,052
notice you are there. He is currently putting away
a crossbow. Looking out the glass window, you can

518
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:19,954
see down with the little bit of light that's in
the courtyard. You see Lord Sylas Briarwood

519
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:25,320
looming over what looks to be the
currently unconscious body of Vax'ildan.

520
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,190
MARISHA: That's right, it's dark outside.

521
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:36,611
MATT: Yes, it is. Bringing us to this point now,
that's your guys' turn. Tiberius? You're up.

522
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:38,900
ORION: Does anyone have eyes on Vax? Anyone?!

523
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,475
SAM: I do! Do I?

524
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:42,890
LAURA: Yeah, you do.

525
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,116
SAM: I think I do.

526
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:46,775
ORION: Where are you, Scanlan?

527
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:53,407
SAM: Inside a room. I don't know where I am. It's
a nice-looking room.

528
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:58,199
ORION: I assume you're in their chambers. I'll be
right there. Fireball to those guys right there!

529
00:45:58,199 --> 00:45:59,303
(explosion sound)

530
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:05,877
MATT: Right there? All right, go ahead and roll
damage! Yeah, they did not

531
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:07,753
make their saving throws.

532
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:11,906
ORION: I wanted to say real quick, right before
that, I got to my decanter of water and I start

533
00:46:11,906 --> 00:46:14,610
charging it, and then I do Fireball.

534
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:24,411
MATT: So roll your damage on that.

535
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:26,900
ORION: How much is that?

536
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,615
TALIESIN: Will that also widen up the hole into
that room?

537
00:46:33,615 --> 00:46:35,711
MARISHA: We'll see, I guess.

538
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:42,060
SAM: Or you could make a wall of fire.

539
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:58,805
ORION: How much is that? 35!

540
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:04,305
MATT: 35? Okay! One of them gets blasted and
thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from

541
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:07,874
the sheer force five foot in that direction. The
one that's this side of the doorway, who was already

542
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:11,979
at one hit point, barely brought from already
being knocked unconscious by Vax, you hear a

543
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:17,255
scream, and is turned to ash, his charred armor
left clattering across the ground.

544
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:19,372
ORION: What about the door?

545
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:24,571
MATT: Both doors are blown open from the force of
the explosion. A large portion of the room is

546
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:27,957
currently singed with black. What's your fly
speed?

547
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:29,732
ORION: 30 feet.

548
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,589
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

549
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:36,082
ORION: Can that dude see me from where I am?

550
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:37,851
MATT: He can currently see you, yeah.

551
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:40,632
ORION: Good. I turn to him and I'm like, you
better get the hell out of my way!

552
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,121
And that's my turn.

553
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:44,966
MATT: Okay! Make an intimidation check.

554
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:47,524
LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Yeah!

555
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:51,152
ORION: 23!

556
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:56,947
MATT: From what you can see, the helmet itself
guards part of the face, but you can see from the

557
00:47:56,947 --> 00:48:02,586
charred, slightly angered, gritting expression on
his mouth as he looks at you as you shout that,

558
00:48:02,586 --> 00:48:09,005
the grittiness goes away, the jaw opens slack, and
takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway.

559
00:48:09,005 --> 00:48:15,375
Does not appear to be interested in threatening
what just blew his friend into ashes.

560
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,454
TRAVIS: Cremated him!

561
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:27,482
MATT: From behind you, as you're flying over you
see this servant come rushing up, the female one

562
00:48:27,482 --> 00:48:34,108
that you saw earlier on the stairway. Rushing
forward, seemingly with an intense look of what

563
00:48:34,108 --> 00:48:41,698
went from curiosity to now engrossed in this
current circumstance. Kit, do you want to go ahead

564
00:48:41,698 --> 00:48:43,236
and take your place?

565
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:45,139
SAM: Wait, what's going on? What do we see?

566
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,968
ORION: This is where she comes in?!

567
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,497
LIAM: You can sit right here!

568
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:56,898
MARISHA: Oh, I'm really sorry I pooped on you! I
didn't know I was shitting on you!

569
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:58,676
ORION: I cleaned you up. Don't worry!

570
00:48:58,676 --> 00:49:06,966
LAURA: Can I ask a question? Trinket. I didn't say
I left him at home. Did he wait outside of the

571
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,856
palace during the formal dinner?

572
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:11,706
MATT: Trinket would not be at the dinner, per se.

573
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,813
LAURA: But he would have stayed outside at the
palace, right?

574
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:18,023
MATT: Trinket would probably be kept somewhere
near the stables, where the people can watch over

575
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:19,022
your animals.

576
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,770
LIAM: He eats at the table with us all the time!

577
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,086
MATT: Not in the middle of the grand hall of the
palace of Tal'Dorei, sorry.

578
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,394
LIAM: She taught him to sit in a chair.

579
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:35,429
MATT: As you rush in, you see this giant fireball
blast through the middle of the hallway. Two of

580
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:39,295
the guards are sent off to the side. There's this
hurried look and this shout. You've seen these

581
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:44,137
individuals throughout the palace before, and
they're part of the council. You've always kept a

582
00:49:44,137 --> 00:49:49,395
distance from them. You're a servant of the
palace; you want to keep up appearances for many

583
00:49:49,395 --> 00:49:55,226
reasons. However, there's this rush of energy and
this general sense of dread in this corner of the

584
00:49:55,226 --> 00:50:00,678
palace. And for the most part, judging by this,
you didn't like the Briarwoods when they arrived,

585
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:04,800
and you think things are going wrong here. What
are you going to do with your turn?

586
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,766
KIT: Can I join in the fray?

587
00:50:08,766 --> 00:50:14,847
MATT: You're right over here in the hallway. It's
hard to see from this perspective here, but you're

588
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,147
right over here.

589
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,711
KIT: Okay.

590
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:20,623
SAM: DM, who is this person who's just joined us?
For the audience.

591
00:50:20,623 --> 00:50:26,016
MATT: This is Kit Buss, who's our official artist for
Critical Role.

592
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:29,049
(cheering)

593
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:32,098
MATT: In from the UK to join us for one session of
awesomeness.

594
00:50:32,098 --> 00:50:33,495
ORION: That's the United Kingdom.

595
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:35,292
TALIESIN: Where the real accents come from!

596
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:39,460
SAM: She's going to be doing the worst American
accent possible.

597
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,420
LIAM: What's going on around here?

598
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,264
MATT: You're over here. There's this guard here,
and these doorways are blown open and seems to be

599
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:53,040
where all the energy's going. You have a good
sense for the flow of energy and emotional

600
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,601
tension, and right now everything is pushing in
that direction.

601
00:50:55,601 --> 00:51:01,647
KIT: Okay, can I use my turn to dash to get
through the doors?

602
00:51:01,647 --> 00:51:09,641
MATT: That'll get you right there. You can just
look past the doors, and they're blown open.

603
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:18,017
That'll be your turn there. As you glance inside,
you can see the gnome member of Vox Machina is

604
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:22,276
there currently at the edge of one window. The
left window is shattered on this side. Seeker

605
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:26,962
Asum, another part of the council, is right at
that. He looks over his shoulder, looks at you and

606
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:33,139
goes, "Shoo!" You see him look like, what are you
doing, no go! Go, stupid servant! That's your

607
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:39,651
turn. All right. That brings us to Percy.

608
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:41,531
TALIESIN: Where am I?

609
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,818
MATT: You were rushing outside with them or
rushing up the stairs?

610
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:46,473
TALIESIN: Rushing outside with them.

611
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:49,933
MATT: Okay, you'll just catch up with them.
They're on the outskirts, just cresting around the

612
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:53,384
side of the palace here. All right.

613
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:56,377
TALIESIN: Am I just there, or am I off the map?

614
00:51:56,377 --> 00:52:00,728
MATT: You're, in theory, off the map on this side.
I'll get to that shortly. You're rushing as fast

615
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:04,824
as you can. You exited the front of the palace and
spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can

616
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:08,461
around the side. It's a long distance, putting all
your energy into it.

617
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:09,960
TALIESIN: I have a very long range.

618
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:19,937
MATT: You have no visual, unfortunately. That
brings us to Sylas.

619
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:22,377
TRAVIS: That dick!

620
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:34,546
MATT: All right. No, sorry. Before Sylas is the
Seeker. Seeker Asum.

621
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:36,398
LAURA: Seeker Awesome?

622
00:52:36,398 --> 00:52:46,161
MATT: Asum! He's pretty awesome. He's going to
leap down here. He's going to make his own

623
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:54,486
acrobatics check, which he does with flying colors
because rangers are cool like that. Lands

624
00:52:54,486 --> 00:53:04,984
immediately and angrily rushes forward going,
"No!" and attempts to feint into an attack, and

625
00:53:04,984 --> 00:53:12,482
Lord Briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to
deflect with preternatural speed just (whoosh) out

626
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:19,008
of the way. Asum, instead, reaches down to grab
the unconscious body of Vax and is going to

627
00:53:19,008 --> 00:53:30,047
attempt to move you away from here. Sylas does get
an attack of opportunity against you.

628
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:35,246
That's a 16?

629
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,802
LIAM: Do I make a death saving throw?

630
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:40,897
MATT: What's your armor class?

631
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:42,289
LIAM: 17.

632
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:45,647
MATT: 17. Unconscious. I'll say there's no dex
bonus to that because you can't move out of the

633
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:54,227
way, so that would be 15. I'm sorry, 12. It hits
you; I rolled for that. You immediately take a

634
00:53:54,227 --> 00:54:13,921
death saving throw. Instantaneously. You failed
one. Now, it is Sylas's turn. That was Seeker

635
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,290
Asum, now it's--

636
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,053
LAURA: Seeker's turn and Sylas got to take a
turn!

637
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:25,411
MATT: He got a free attack because he moved out of
range to try to hit him. Rushes up to join the

638
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:44,434
fray there. He's going to look towards Seeker Asum
and say, "This quarrel is not with you." Asum

639
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:55,638
looks over his shoulder. Asum relaxes his grip on
Vax's body and stands at attention. And you hear

640
00:54:55,638 --> 00:55:00,566
him say, "My apologies, I did not mean to meddle."
He seems to be stepping out of the fray.

641
00:55:00,566 --> 00:55:01,872
TRAVIS: Seeker Asum is?

642
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:11,553
MATT: Yes. That's a charm action to get him out of
that. That will be Sylas' turn.

643
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:14,482
That brings us to Keyleth.

644
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:22,324
MARISHA: I'm going to go double my speed. My fly
speed is 80 feet right now. I'm going to head

645
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:23,958
towards and pick up Scanlan.

646
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:35,858
MATT: Make a general dexterity check. You're
flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle

647
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:37,854
flowing through.

648
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:45,077
MARISHA: Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my
eagle form, right? 12?

649
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:52,238
MATT: 12? Okay, that's fine. You clip a wing. It
hurts, and you wince at the impact, but you manage

650
00:55:52,238 --> 00:55:57,205
to make your way in there. As you come down, you
grab Scanlan, but there's not a lot of room here

651
00:55:57,205 --> 00:56:02,977
to get much lift or air, so you're now clutching
your gnome.

652
00:56:02,977 --> 00:56:05,290
SAM: Do I get a save?

653
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,287
MATT: Do you not want to be grabbed by her?

654
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:11,529
SAM: Well, I don't know she's there. I don't know
what's grabbing me.

655
00:56:11,529 --> 00:56:13,475
MARISHA: You've seen me turn into an eagle.

656
00:56:13,475 --> 00:56:15,016
SAM: I'm not even looking at you.

657
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:18,086
MATT: Make an insight check.

658
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:22,144
SAM: Insight check? Okay. Not good. Five.

659
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:27,148
MATT: Five. Okay, you see this giant eagle come
screeching into the room, talons out, and starts

660
00:56:27,148 --> 00:56:35,081
coming at you with talons. Be mindful of that.
It's technically now a grapple contest, so go

661
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,051
ahead and make an athletics check.

662
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:48,638
MARISHA: An athletics check with my eagle. Is that
dex or strength?

663
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,227
MATT: It would be strength.

664
00:56:50,227 --> 00:56:52,389
MARISHA: 19.

665
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:55,865
MATT: 19. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check to
avoid it, or athletics. Athletics or acrobatics,

666
00:56:55,865 --> 00:56:56,989
your choice.

667
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:57,997
SAM: 15.

668
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,148
MATT: 15. As much as you try and fight, the eagle
grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in

669
00:57:02,148 --> 00:57:06,166
its claws. Oh, woe is this evening.

670
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:10,418
SAM: First, I got a small drink, and now this?

671
00:57:10,418 --> 00:57:21,089
MATT: All right, that finishes Keyleth's turn. I
need you to make a second death saving throw.

672
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:22,768
LIAM: I succeeded.

673
00:57:22,768 --> 00:57:24,803
MATT: Okay, so you stabilize.

674
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:26,263
LIAM: Wait, I'm at one?

675
00:57:26,263 --> 00:57:37,767
MATT: You didn't die. Sorry. My apologies. Vex,
you swing around the corner, just getting to the

676
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:38,938
outskirts.

677
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:46,263
LAURA: Right as I get outside-- I would whistle,
but Vex can whistle, and she whistles for

678
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:47,309
Trinket.

679
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,269
MATT: You're not sure where Trinket is.

680
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,941
LAURA: No, but I whistle for him. He knows to
listen for it.

681
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:55,280
MATT: Do you want to get as close as possible to
the fray?

682
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,463
LAURA: Yes.

683
00:57:56,463 --> 00:58:02,486
MATT: I'd say as you turn the corner, that will
get you about there, and you can see now, there is

684
00:58:02,486 --> 00:58:11,445
Seeker Asum and Lord Briarwood both standing over
what looks to be a small cluster of cloth, the

685
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:13,565
source of the dread.

686
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:19,950
LAURA: I scream. Can I attack?

687
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,726
MATT: You can, yeah.

688
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:35,561
LAURA: Okay, if I did something that did five
feet-- ten feet... I've got to look at this. Yeah,

689
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:41,451
ten feet. If I hit Lady Briarwood, would that hit
my brother, or would that just hit Bastard

690
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,618
Briarwood?

691
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:46,889
MATT: No, that would just hit her. Oh, within ten
feet? It would hit Seeker and Sylas, yeah.

692
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:52,362
LAURA: Fuck it, I'm doing it. Lightning Arrow
right at her face.

693
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,110
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for it.

694
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,396
SAM: Don't miss.

695
00:58:57,396 --> 00:58:59,036
LAURA: Well, that's wedged.

696
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:03,088
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a weirdo roll.

697
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:07,334
LAURA: Natural 20!

698
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:13,524
MATT: The fury pumps through your veins in an
attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your

699
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:18,404
twin brother at death's door. You pull the arrow
from the back of your quiver. As you feel the

700
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:24,443
energy gather from the atmosphere around you,
while the energy itself is a blue crackling

701
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:31,983
energy, you see it as bright, vibrant crimson red.
You release it with a scream towards Lady

702
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:35,244
Briarwood. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

703
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:42,296
LAURA: What do I do, times two?

704
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:44,567
MATT: Yes, times two.

705
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:53,601
LAURA: So it was 32 damage on her, and then
everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save.

706
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:58,189
MATT: All right, he doesn't get one.

707
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:04,873
LAURA: Not him. He's not in it. And I Hunter's
Marked her.

708
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:07,146
MATT: Right, so it does additional damage.

709
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,308
LAURA: Fuck. One.

710
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:09,518
MATT: One. Okay.

711
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:11,226
MARISHA: Every little bit counts.

712
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:16,866
MATT: The lightning hits her. It shocks her, and
you see the pain come through, but for the sheer

713
01:00:16,866 --> 01:00:21,157
force that should have been, it seems almost like
it wasn't as impactful as it should have been.

714
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:31,950
However, Lord Briarwood and Seeker Asum both fail,
so they both take the additional damage.

715
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:44,350
LAURA: Oh, good. Then 2d8 for them. Nine, and then
times two because it was critical? 18.

716
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,120
MATT: Sure. I'll allow it.

717
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,454
LIAM: Haggling.

718
01:00:47,454 --> 01:00:52,405
LAURA: And I get another attack, though. Yes?
Okay, then I'm going to attack her through my

719
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:56,151
Blazing Bowstring.

720
01:00:56,259 --> 01:00:57,536
Natural 20 again!

721
01:00:57,536 --> 01:00:59,633
(cheering)

722
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:01,600
LAURA: Inspired by my brother!

723
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:11,328
MATT: You've certainly invoked the fury tonight.
All right, go ahead.

724
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:15,275
LIAM: She loves me.

725
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:17,424
MATT: Against Lady Briarwood to follow up on
that?

726
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:26,081
LAURA: Yes, of course it is! Okay, eight plus
seven is 15 plus two for bracers, so that's 17

727
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:27,743
times two is 34.

728
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:29,045
SAM: Hunter's Mark.

729
01:01:29,045 --> 01:01:42,230
LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark damage, which is another
fucking six! 38 damage. No! No, it is 40 damage.

730
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:51,586
MATT: Well, no, she's not concentrating because
he's unconscious. I was saving for the Hold Person

731
01:01:51,586 --> 01:01:53,579
spell, but she's not concentrating on that,
currently.

732
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,815
LAURA: She's on fire!

733
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,575
MATT: She is actually lit on fire.

734
01:01:56,575 --> 01:02:05,655
LAURA: I should say what the Blazing Bowstring
does, huh? An additional d10 of damage for that.

735
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:10,390
Would that have been part of the part that was
multiplied by two?

736
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,582
MATT: No.

737
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,634
LAURA: Another six for that.

738
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:19,151
LIAM: Does Seeker Asum get a save now that he's
been hit, to shake that charm?

739
01:02:19,151 --> 01:02:28,068
MATT: It has to be damage from the allies of the
person who charmed them, so no. You guys are

740
01:02:28,068 --> 01:02:41,684
currently considered a threat to him. All right,
so that ends your turn. That brings us to Delilah.

741
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:51,059
Delilah, who's now on fire. Laura, the Blazing
Bowstring, does that ignite her? Does she take

742
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,487
continuous fire damage, or is that just one-time
fire damage? No, it's an additional 1d10 once. She

743
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,540
shrugs off the flames. I remember that. Angrily.

744
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:05,255
KIT: At least you messed up her dress.

745
01:03:05,255 --> 01:03:07,116
LAURA: Yeah, fuck that dress!

746
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:11,661
MATT: As the electrical energy and the flames
dissipate, she puts her hands out like this, and

747
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:16,595
she looks at you for a second and she extends one
cruel finger towards you with a look of intense

748
01:03:16,595 --> 01:03:20,318
hatred. I need you to make a constitution save.

749
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,051
LAURA: Okay.

750
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:30,170
MATT: I don't know if she has to aim it or not.
Let me check. Nope! I need you to make a

751
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,752
constitution saving throw.

752
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:39,873
LAURA: Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17.

753
01:03:39,873 --> 01:03:43,630
MATT: 17. That's not enough, unfortunately.

754
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:55,292
SAM: Oh man. That's a lot of rolling.

755
01:03:55,292 --> 01:04:00,389
LIAM: Carry the three...

756
01:04:00,389 --> 01:04:09,155
MATT: You take 66 points of necrotic damage as a
sickly beam of black energy streaks out from her

757
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:14,933
finger, plows into your torso, and you feel as if
your soul is temporarily pulled from a portion of

758
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:21,085
your body. For a second there, your eyes glance
past the threshold of death, and you manage to

759
01:04:21,085 --> 01:04:29,108
pull yourself back in. The cold resonates through
the rest of your body, and all of a sudden the

760
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:34,337
temperature outside, which was already pretty
chilly, feels freezing cold. Brush with the Finger

761
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:44,883
of Death. All right, she is going to move over
towards Sylas right here, getting into a

762
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:53,335
protective standpoint, glancing down at the
unconscious body of Vax. That brings us to-- we

763
01:04:53,335 --> 01:04:55,853
have Grog, Tiberius, and Scanlan.

764
01:04:55,853 --> 01:05:05,481
SAM: I'm going first. Fucking shit. I know she's
got me in her fucking claws.

765
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:09,864
MATT: You've figured this out now, after this
whole (yelps). Keyleth, of course.

766
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,370
SAM: Can I still see through the window?

767
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,846
MATT: You can see through the window right there,
yeah. It's hard, at this point.

768
01:05:13,846 --> 01:05:20,455
SAM: Okay, I'll use my bonus action first to cast
Healing Word on Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf--

769
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:22,717
MATT: What's the range on Healing Word?

770
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:24,119
MARISHA: 30 feet.

771
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:30,400
MATT: He is not close enough to reach. You'll have
to move first.

772
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,056
LAURA: Then maybe you don't want to go first.

773
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:33,300
MARISHA: I can take you over there.

774
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,487
SAM: Would I know that?

775
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:37,027
MATT: You would know the range of it. You'd be
like, "Ugh, he's too far."

776
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:38,537
TRAVIS: You can move first, can't you?

777
01:05:38,537 --> 01:05:40,494
SAM: I can't move. She's holding me.

778
01:05:40,494 --> 01:05:41,809
LAURA: You can wait.

779
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:46,486
MARISHA: I'm trying to give you a fast way down,
motherfucker.

780
01:05:46,486 --> 01:05:49,736
SAM: I know. I guess I'll hold my turn.

781
01:05:49,736 --> 01:05:52,675
MATT: Okay. All right. Tiberius?

782
01:05:52,675 --> 01:05:58,444
ORION: Okay. Move me an additional 30 feet because
my flight is 60 feet,

783
01:05:58,444 --> 01:06:00,382
so that was from the last turn.

784
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:02,517
MATT: Okay, 60 feet flying speed. Good to know.

785
01:06:02,517 --> 01:06:07,704
ORION: Let's swoop in that room. Another 60 feet.
How far can I go? Can I go all the way down?

786
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:09,576
MATT: That's as far as you can get, right there.

787
01:06:09,576 --> 01:06:12,876
ORION: Crap, balls. Can I see anything? I can't
see anything. Outside?

788
01:06:12,876 --> 01:06:15,453
MATT: That's the 60 feet for your movement.

789
01:06:15,453 --> 01:06:17,737
ORION: I'm still flying, so can I see?

790
01:06:17,737 --> 01:06:23,765
MATT: Right, from an elevated standpoint, you
would probably just barely be able to see the edge

791
01:06:23,765 --> 01:06:29,464
of Lord Briarwood down there, below. He would have
three-quarters cover, but you can see him.

792
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:30,732
ORION: I can't see Vax?

793
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:33,567
MATT: No. Not from the angle of the window.

794
01:06:33,567 --> 01:06:39,156
ORION: I charge my decanter. That's my turn.

795
01:06:39,156 --> 01:06:44,819
MATT: Okay. All right. You can use your action to
move, if you want to get closer to the window.

796
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:46,992
ORION: Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that?

797
01:06:46,992 --> 01:06:48,480
MATT: Or you could go outside, if you wanted to.

798
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,887
ORION: Then I can't do anything else after that,
right?

799
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,833
MATT: This would be the end of your turn,
regardless.

800
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,779
ORION: Okay, then get me right where I can see
Vax.

801
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,932
MATT: Right there?

802
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:01,197
ORION: Actually, skootch me one over. I can still
see him from right there, yeah?

803
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:04,437
MATT: Yeah, you can see him there. Cool, so you're
floating in the air, currently, looking through

804
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:10,134
the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem that's
below. That ends Tiberius's turn. Grog.

805
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:16,239
TRAVIS: Raging, I see Vex take off so fast. I try
and catch up to her and see what's freaking her

806
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:18,093
out so much. My speed is 50.

807
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:27,294
SAM: Wait, no. Healing Word has a 60 feet range.
You said 30!

808
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,021
TRAVIS: You're after me. It's okay.

809
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:31,821
MATT: It's all happening simultaneously.

810
01:07:31,821 --> 01:07:38,583
TRAVIS: I take the Firebrand Warhammer with the
Chain of Returning attached to it. I activate it,

811
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:41,912
and I throw it at Lady Delilah.

812
01:07:41,912 --> 01:07:44,580
MATT: Okay. What's the range on it?

813
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:51,658
TRAVIS: It doesn't have a distance. It has a DC to
pull it back.

814
01:07:51,658 --> 01:07:57,095
MATT: Here's what we'll do. It's the warhammer or
war pick?

815
01:07:57,095 --> 01:08:00,951
TRAVIS: Yeah, the warhammer, but the Chain of
Returning doesn't have a distance.

816
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,382
MATT: I know. It's the distance of the weapon, is
what it is.

817
01:08:03,382 --> 01:08:04,555
TRAVIS: Okay.

818
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:06,807
MATT: Looking it up right now for you.

819
01:08:06,807 --> 01:08:09,577
TALIESIN: What did we do before iPhones?

820
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:11,569
TRAVIS: How is it 150/120?

821
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:15,231
LAURA: Yeah, because you used it when we were
fighting that manta ray.

822
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,611
MATT: I don't have a Player's Handbook. If
somebody could look up the

823
01:08:18,611 --> 01:08:20,195
equipment section right now?

824
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:21,672
MARISHA: What are you looking for?

825
01:08:21,672 --> 01:08:28,780
MATT: Excuse the sound change here, as I have to
move the mic. There we go. I got it. There is a

826
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,689
range on thrown weapons, unfortunately.

827
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,587
TALIESIN: Does it count as a mace? Handaxe?

828
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:44,911
MATT: Warhammer... this one is not considered an
actual normally thrown weapon, so I would give it

829
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:52,747
the same distance of a handaxe, which is 60-foot
max, but you would be at disadvantage on the

830
01:08:52,747 --> 01:08:57,474
throw, anyway. Pretty heavy disadvantage on this,
so we'll give it a shot.

831
01:08:57,474 --> 01:08:59,758
TRAVIS: That doesn't even make 60 feet, though,
does it?

832
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:07,625
MATT: No. As you lob--

833
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:13,479
TRAVIS: If I know how long it is, can I do
something else instead of throwing it? If I'd

834
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:14,764
known the distance--

835
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:16,483
MATT: Yeah, if you know the distance, then I'll
say sure.

836
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,486
TRAVIS: Can I try for Intimidating Presence?

837
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:19,580
MATT: Sure.

838
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,259
TRAVIS: There's a DC saving throw--

839
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,093
MATT: Against her?

840
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:24,120
TRAVIS: Yeah.

841
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,115
MATT: Okay. She glances over at you as you come
running around the corner, this giant engine of

842
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:32,664
muscle and death. You growl at her, screaming--

843
01:09:32,664 --> 01:09:34,083
TRAVIS: (roars) No!

844
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,860
MATT: What's the DC on it?

845
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,191
TRAVIS: 13.

846
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:44,266
MATT: 13. She glances over at you and you see her
head turn to the side with a curious chuckle.

847
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:45,509
TRAVIS: So low! God!

848
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:47,311
MATT: Yeah. Sorry.

849
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:50,312
MARISHA: Bring it back to Sam.

850
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:55,784
MATT: All right. Kit, you're up. Oh, that's right.
You're doing your turn. Continue.

851
01:09:55,784 --> 01:09:57,411
SAM: Will 60 feet hit him?

852
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:58,535
MATT: Yes, it would.

853
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:08,099
SAM: Okay, then I will heal Vax. (singing) Oh,
that Vax elf, getting bit by vampires, and his

854
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:18,241
skin's turning pale and white. But don't worry,
because around the corner, here comes Scanlan.

855
01:10:18,241 --> 01:10:20,840
Everything's going to be all right.

856
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,429
LIAM: I feel like I'm going insane!

857
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,711
MATT: All right, so roll for how much you heal
him.

858
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:30,692
SAM: Even though that's a bonus action, I'm going
to do it as a 5th-level spell.

859
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:41,816
MATT: It's an additional 1d4 for each, so it would
be 5d4 plus five.

860
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:42,720
SAM: And I roll it?

861
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,844
MATT: Yes, you do.

862
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:46,084
SAM: Okay. Well, then give me a bunch of d4s.

863
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:50,233
MATT: Kit, you're on deck, so imagine what you're
going to do next.

864
01:10:50,233 --> 01:11:00,079
SAM: I need one more. Great. Okay. Whoa, what the
hell is that one? Ah, shit! What are these? I can

865
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:02,925
never add d4.

866
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,294
ORION: 12. Plus?

867
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:10,102
MATT: Five. So you heal 17 hit points. From the
darkness--

868
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:13,677
SAM: Wait, is it plus five, or is it plus five,
five, five--

869
01:11:13,677 --> 01:11:18,919
MATT: No, it's plus five. Consciousness comes to
you. Breath comes into your chest, and you can

870
01:11:18,919 --> 01:11:23,590
feel the cold, wet grass against the left side of
your face. Your vision begins to clarify for a

871
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:28,130
second, and you look up over you. You can see
immediately to the right of you both Lord and Lady

872
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,927
Briarwood standing over you, looking down with one
half of their gaze, the other

873
01:11:31,927 --> 01:11:33,090
paying attention to--

874
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,395
LIAM: They're looking at me?

875
01:11:34,395 --> 01:11:41,817
MATT: They're looking down at you and glancing at
this slowly encroaching circle of assailants. That

876
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:42,976
was your bonus action.

877
01:11:42,976 --> 01:11:47,749
SAM: That was my bonus action. As my <i>action</i>
action-- oh man, this is stupid. I lift my Hand

878
01:11:47,749 --> 01:11:56,812
Cone of Clarity, and I sing to Lady Delilah,
(singing) Hey there, Delilah, won't you listen to

879
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:05,544
me because I'm about to cast a spell on you. Ooh!
Oh! (speaking) Okay, so I'm going to use

880
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:09,213
Suggestion on her. This is so stupid!

881
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:11,982
MATT: So what's the DC on that?

882
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:14,527
SAM: Well, it's 19.

883
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:18,705
MATT: With that. Okay, good to know. What are you
suggesting to her?

884
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:26,266
SAM: I'm suggesting that she has an unquenchable
urge to make out with her husband.

885
01:12:26,266 --> 01:12:33,377
MATT: All right. And what saving throw is it? Is
it a wisdom saving throw?

886
01:12:33,377 --> 01:12:40,815
SAM: It is wisdom.

887
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:47,863
MATT: Wisdom. Okay, good to know. Rolled an 18.
She has advantage on it, anyway. All right. Yeah,

888
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:55,082
she rolled a natural 18, plus her wisdom bonus of
two. That puts her at a 20. She just crested over

889
01:12:55,082 --> 01:13:00,749
it. You can see, she glances up for a second at
you. The presence of the actual shouting and the

890
01:13:00,749 --> 01:13:05,098
Suggestion echoing through the glass and out the
other broken window. She looks up and you see

891
01:13:05,098 --> 01:13:09,850
parts of the shards of the glass are actually
shaking from your singing. The harmonic resonance

892
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,444
of the glass catching your--

893
01:13:11,444 --> 01:13:13,679
LIAM: She doesn't feel even a little bit horny?

894
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,931
MATT: You gather that probably at all given
points of time, she probably enjoys being close to

895
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:22,803
her husband, but not overcome with an
uncontrollable urge.

896
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:24,576
SAM: She has a headache.

897
01:13:24,576 --> 01:13:28,525
MATT: Right. All right, so that ends Scanlan.
Kit.

898
01:13:28,525 --> 01:13:34,412
KIT: Okay. Am I within 120 feet of either of the
Briarwoods?

899
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:38,512
MATT: You are, but they're not currently in visual
range because they're outside and down below, so

900
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:41,985
if you want to try and move over this way, you can
try to get a visual.

901
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,963
KIT: Am I able to move somewhere where I can see
them?

902
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:53,669
MATT: You would have to leap up onto the edge of
the canopy bed. You can just see them past the

903
01:13:53,669 --> 01:14:00,102
broken window, down into the courtyard there, as
Tiberius, the dragonborn you saw coast through, is

904
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,853
hovering in the air about five feet above you.

905
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:15,194
KIT: I would like to -- oh, there's lots of
excitement going on, isn't there? I would like to

906
01:14:15,194 --> 01:14:18,334
use Crown of Madness, if I may.

907
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,855
SAM: Wait! I thought she was just a common guard!

908
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:22,447
LAURA: Servant.

909
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:30,491
KIT: I would like to use Crown of Madness on Lord
Briarwood.

910
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:35,496
MATT: All righty. What is the DC on the spell?

911
01:14:35,496 --> 01:14:40,853
KIT: My DC would be eight plus my spellcasting
modifier--

912
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:43,117
MATT: It should be at the very top of your spell
sheet.

913
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:45,091
KIT: Okay. 17.

914
01:14:45,091 --> 01:14:53,722
MATT: 17. All right. Against Lord Briarwood...
(chuckles) Even with his plus seven--

915
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,133
LAURA: Yay!

916
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,661
TALIESIN: Oh my god, is something actually going
to work?

917
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:04,958
MATT: He is going to use his legendary resistance
to succeed the saving throw. So as you do that,

918
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:09,903
you see the magical energy form around his head
and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and

919
01:15:09,903 --> 01:15:13,303
begins to clasp around, and he looks up for a
second and shrugs his hair like that, and it

920
01:15:13,303 --> 01:15:17,737
(crash) dissipates, and you can see for a brief
second his vision come up and find your gaze.

921
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:20,263
MARISHA: But Matt, she's our guest!

922
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:25,234
MATT: I understand! As it was a concentration
spell, also, the illusion that you currently were

923
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:30,955
holding fades away. What was once the demure,
mousy-looking human guest suddenly appears as a

924
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:40,698
pale, white tiefling, currently now existing at
the edge of the bed. Her image shimmers and

925
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:45,552
disappears as you see her standing before you on
her hoofed legs, holding what was previously a

926
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:47,482
non-visible staff in one hand.

927
01:15:47,482 --> 01:15:48,565
ORION: And I'm right above her?

928
01:15:48,565 --> 01:15:50,135
MATT: You are right above her, yeah.

929
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:52,997
ORION: I go, ooh! Nice horns!

930
01:15:52,997 --> 01:15:56,505
MATT: Looking over your shoulder, you're a little
bit in front of her, but yeah, you see her. All

931
01:15:56,505 --> 01:15:59,342
right, so that will be your turn there.

932
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:04,167
LAURA: Our friend is in mortal danger right now,
you maybe wouldn't want to hit on somebody, at

933
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,400
that moment.

934
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,235
KIT: I would have to agree.

935
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:12,731
MATT: Percy. Following suit, you begin to move
around the corner to the others. You are now

936
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:20,682
within visual range of both Briarwoods-- at a far
distance, though-- too far for the Pepperbox. No,

937
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:22,608
its range is 150, so yeah.

938
01:16:22,608 --> 01:16:30,414
TALIESIN: Pepperbox range is 150, but the Bad
News range is disgusting.

939
01:16:30,414 --> 01:16:32,485
MATT: Nah, they're within range for both.

940
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:34,190
TALIESIN: So I'll start with Bad News.

941
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,656
MARISHA: Nothing travels faster.

942
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:41,166
TALIESIN: (sighs) All right. First shot.

943
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,428
MATT: Against who?

944
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:45,502
TALIESIN: (yelling) Sylas!

945
01:16:45,502 --> 01:16:49,366
TRAVIS: Yes. I got little goosebumps from that.

946
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:54,114
TALIESIN: That's a 30 to hit.

947
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:56,986
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

948
01:16:56,986 --> 01:16:58,879
TRAVIS: Rock. His. Shit.

949
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:03,412
TALIESIN: (sighs) This is about to feel so good.

950
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:05,496
TRAVIS: De-cleat this motherfucker.

951
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:09,548
MARISHA: These are the worst people we've ever
faced.

952
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:16,322
TALIESIN: I hate them, I hate them <i>so much</i>.
Where's my other d12s?

953
01:17:16,322 --> 01:17:19,631
MARISHA: d12s? 12, 12 away.

954
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:27,874
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

955
01:17:27,874 --> 01:17:37,060
MATT: Okay. The first shot. As you (gunshot), the
shot echoing out across the night sky of Emon,

956
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:41,772
Lord Briarwood, who is currently staring down at
you as you come to consciousness, and you can see

957
01:17:41,772 --> 01:17:46,345
under his breath, he says, "Oh, there's no way out
tonight, friend." And begins to lean forward

958
01:17:46,345 --> 01:17:51,267
before (impact) the back of his shoulder is
wracked by a sudden impact. You see dark material

959
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:56,289
just (spray) spatter out with some sort of dark
crimson, and he (grunts). Looks over his shoulder

960
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:59,096
with anger, and you can see at that point,
glistening across the moonlight, the sharpened

961
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:01,407
fangs visible at the edge of his mouth. As he
looks over--

962
01:18:01,407 --> 01:18:05,236
TALIESIN: Is he looking at me? Okay, good, I'm
taking another aimed shot at his face.

963
01:18:05,236 --> 01:18:07,511
MATT: Okay, so you use your second attack to
reload.

964
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:11,216
TALIESIN: Third shot, aimed shot at the face,
while he was turning around.

965
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:17,873
LIAM: As he reloaded, weakly, behind him, I go,
hi, Percy.

966
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:21,179
TALIESIN: That's 24 to hit.

967
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:23,143
MATT: 24 to hit will hit.

968
01:18:23,143 --> 01:18:29,231
SAM: Skadoosh!

969
01:18:29,231 --> 01:18:36,528
TALIESIN: (laughs) That's 28 points of damage, and
he has disadvantage on all attacks for this

970
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:37,410
round.

971
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,513
MARISHA: Yes!

972
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:49,816
MATT: Okay. That was using the arm shot? Good. So
as he turns around and glares at you, there's like

973
01:18:49,816 --> 01:18:52,620
a moment of clarity, and you can feel that
familiar stare, that horrible glare, and the

974
01:18:52,620 --> 01:19:00,034
cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that
you've been waiting for this sequence. As you load

975
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:05,415
the weapon, he says it loudly enough for you to
hear, but this voice now, you see Lord Briarwood

976
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:12,830
says, "Would you look at that, dear? The pup yet
lives." (chuckles, gunshot)

977
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,765
(laughter)

978
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:22,410
MATT: A big chunk of flesh is just blown off and
you can see the bone beneath. (grunts, growls)

979
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,908
KIT: No mercy Percy!

980
01:19:24,908 --> 01:19:29,320
TALIESIN: Is that as far as I can make it?

981
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,352
MATT: It's as far as you can get. You still have
your heroic action, if you wanted to do that.

982
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:48,571
Holding onto it? Okay. All right. So that will end
your turn. Seeker is then going to turn this way,

983
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:54,838
step towards the side and pull his crossbow out.
It was already loaded with a bolt into it, and

984
01:19:54,838 --> 01:20:01,806
he's going to take a shot at Grog, who's currently
the biggest target right now. That's going to be--

985
01:20:01,806 --> 01:20:05,950
rolled a two. That's going to be a 13 against
armor class.

986
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:07,187
TRAVIS: Misses.

987
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:13,504
MATT: Yeah. Goes and for the bonus action reloads
and gets the second shot at you.

988
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,535
That will be a 19.

989
01:20:15,535 --> 01:20:16,635
TRAVIS: Hits.

990
01:20:16,635 --> 01:20:33,045
MATT: All right. You take seven points of piercing
damage, halved because of your rage. And with the

991
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:37,855
rest of his movement, Seeker Asum's going to go
ahead and step back in the shadow beside there.

992
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:41,524
Ending that turn, now it comes to Lord Briarwood.

993
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:43,285
MARISHA: Wait, I didn't get my turn?

994
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:44,575
MATT: Keyleth, you're up after him.

995
01:20:44,575 --> 01:20:48,591
LIAM: And I have a question. At some point I'm in
the mix?

996
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:52,899
MATT: Yeah, you're coming up. Don't worry. You
guys rolled the lowest initiatives.

997
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:55,918
ORION: Oh, he's prone, still.

998
01:20:55,918 --> 01:21:04,077
MATT: He's still prone, yeah. So Sylas is going
to, seeing the circumstance, reach down and

999
01:21:04,077 --> 01:21:06,663
attempt to grab you.

1000
01:21:06,663 --> 01:21:07,996
SAM: Get out of there.

1001
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:13,633
MATT: He has disadvantage because of that.
(laughs) All right,

1002
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:15,540
that's going to be a total of 11.

1003
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,070
LIAM: To do what? To grapple check? Do I have to
roll, too?

1004
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,401
MATT: To attempt to grapple you, yeah.

1005
01:21:19,401 --> 01:21:20,416
LIAM: So I roll, as well.

1006
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:21,539
MATT: You don't have to.

1007
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:23,363
LIAM: Yeah, fuck that guy.

1008
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:37,715
MATT: Yeah, so it missed entirely. All right, so
that's with his first strike. Second one, he's

1009
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:45,298
going to go for another attempted grapple on you.
With disadvantage, that comes to 18.

1010
01:21:45,298 --> 01:21:46,752
LIAM: For hitting?

1011
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:50,384
MATT: For hitting you. All right. And now he's
going to make an athletics check to attempt to

1012
01:21:50,384 --> 01:21:59,863
grapple you. That is going to be a 13.

1013
01:21:59,863 --> 01:22:04,335
SAM: As I see this going on, can I call out with
Cutting Words to distract him?

1014
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:06,382
MATT: You could, yes.

1015
01:22:06,382 --> 01:22:16,006
SAM: Okay. (singing) Distraction, distraction!
Distraction! Distraction, distraction!

1016
01:22:16,006 --> 01:22:18,150
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d10.

1017
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:19,262
SAM: What do I roll?

1018
01:22:19,262 --> 01:22:22,569
MATT: d10. And subtract that from his attack
modifier.

1019
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,265
SAM: Six.

1020
01:22:25,265 --> 01:22:32,045
MATT: Okay. With that, as he reaches down in an
attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat,

1021
01:22:32,045 --> 01:22:36,844
the fingers are coming towards you and you try and
attempt to roll out of the way. All of sudden, you

1022
01:22:36,844 --> 01:22:43,716
hear, "Distraction!" and Lord Briarwood's,
(annoyed sigh). You see his massive eyeroll and

1023
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:47,691
then goes in for the attack, but that's given you
enough time to roll out of the way his hand only

1024
01:22:47,691 --> 01:23:01,165
meets the ground. He's then going to step back and
get adjacent to Lady Briarwood. That ends his

1025
01:23:01,165 --> 01:23:03,112
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1026
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:05,438
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to fly out the window
with Scanlan.

1027
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:07,432
MATT: Out the broken one over here or the
non-broken one?

1028
01:23:07,432 --> 01:23:08,590
MARISHA: The broken one.

1029
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,748
MATT: Okay.

1030
01:23:09,748 --> 01:23:11,945
SAM: What are you doing to me?

1031
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,398
MATT: So you're coasting over here.

1032
01:23:14,398 --> 01:23:16,422
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and drop him off.

1033
01:23:16,422 --> 01:23:22,006
MATT: Okay, so as you swoop down and leave Scanlan
right there in front of them, that'll be there.

1034
01:23:22,006 --> 01:23:26,343
MARISHA: So Seeker Asum, he's against us?

1035
01:23:26,343 --> 01:23:30,662
MATT: You have no idea, you just swooped out there
and he's there like hiding in the shadow.

1036
01:23:30,662 --> 01:23:32,010
MARISHA: But he just fired at Grog.

1037
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:35,004
MATT: You didn't see it, though, from your
perspective there. You just saw a bolt go.

1038
01:23:35,004 --> 01:23:38,556
MARISHA: Oh, I didn't see that. Do I still have
enough movement to make an action?

1039
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:42,250
MATT: Yeah you do, yes, that was just your
movement as you swooped down.

1040
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,500
MARISHA: Where's Lord Briarwood?

1041
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,191
MATT: Right there.

1042
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:50,431
MARISHA: I'm going to go and try and peck his eyes
out.

1043
01:23:50,431 --> 01:23:51,971
SAM: Are you dropping me?

1044
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:54,363
MARISHA: Yeah, I dropped you off, I'm going to go
and swoop over--

1045
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:58,356
MATT: Okay. You've already used your movement to
get there and drop him off and go all the way

1046
01:23:58,356 --> 01:23:59,533
around.

1047
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:01,029
MARISHA: That's what I was asking.

1048
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:03,415
MATT: Yeah, you used your full movement to get
there and drop off Scanlan.

1049
01:24:03,415 --> 01:24:05,205
TRAVIS: Do you still want to be an eagle?

1050
01:24:05,205 --> 01:24:08,128
LIAM: Yeah, because it's a hit point sponge.

1051
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:13,134
MARISHA: Yeah, you know what, I'll drop eagle
form.

1052
01:24:13,134 --> 01:24:18,312
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, all of a sudden the eagle
condenses down and forms back into Keyleth in her

1053
01:24:18,312 --> 01:24:19,285
half-elven form.

1054
01:24:19,285 --> 01:24:22,332
MARISHA: And I will also use my bonus action to
cast Healing Word on Vax.

1055
01:24:22,332 --> 01:24:24,025
MATT: Okay.

1056
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:29,034
MARISHA: And I will also cast it at-- actually,
I'll cast it at a 3rd level because

1057
01:24:29,034 --> 01:24:30,610
I want to be safe.

1058
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,002
SAM: Here are some d4s.

1059
01:24:32,002 --> 01:24:32,988
MARISHA: Thank you.

1060
01:24:32,988 --> 01:24:34,892
LAURA: She cast it at Vax.

1061
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:41,922
SAM: So you need one more, right? At level three?

1062
01:24:41,922 --> 01:24:49,290
MARISHA: Oh, and it's plus my spell modifier? Is
that what it is? Plus ten, so yeah, I need one

1063
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,855
more, so that's 17 points.

1064
01:24:51,855 --> 01:24:53,621
MATT: 17 points of healing.

1065
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,382
ORION: Hers is different.

1066
01:24:55,382 --> 01:25:03,879
MARISHA: Oh no, wait. No, 15. Sorry.

1067
01:25:03,879 --> 01:25:05,554
SAM: You're back.

1068
01:25:05,554 --> 01:25:08,888
LAURA: You're back, baby.

1069
01:25:08,888 --> 01:25:12,403
MATT: And with that, Vax.

1070
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:19,126
LIAM: You have to tell me what's possible. I'm
prone, right?

1071
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:20,796
MATT: You are prone on the ground.

1072
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:25,698
LIAM: This is what I'd like to do. You tell me if
it's possible. I'd like to click my boots of haste

1073
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:31,264
together and then get up, which takes my full
movement? What does it take?

1074
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,865
MATT: Half your movement.

1075
01:25:32,865 --> 01:25:37,598
LIAM: Half my movement. This is what I want to do,
you tell me if it's possible. Click my boots of

1076
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:47,742
haste, get up, use disengage again, and then run
like a motherfuck straight towards--

1077
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,537
MATT: Yeah, you could probably do that, yeah.

1078
01:25:49,537 --> 01:25:50,649
TRAVIS: Do it!

1079
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:51,946
LIAM: That's what I want to do.

1080
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,255
SAM: Straight towards what?

1081
01:25:53,255 --> 01:25:59,254
LIAM: My sister. And as I run past, I share a very
awkward glance with Keyleth and keep going and

1082
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:03,066
just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at
her.

1083
01:26:03,066 --> 01:26:07,321
MATT: Okay, and what's your full movement then? It
would be 30 times two, which would be 60, half

1084
01:26:07,321 --> 01:26:11,878
that, so you can run 30 feet because it takes half
your movement to get up. So yeah, you disengage.

1085
01:26:11,878 --> 01:26:16,261
There you go.

1086
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:18,275
LAURA: There you go.

1087
01:26:18,275 --> 01:26:26,100
SAM: Well good, I'm glad I'm tip of the spear now.
Jesus. (laughs) How did that happen?

1088
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,798
LAURA: Dimension Door!

1089
01:26:27,798 --> 01:26:32,887
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. At the top
is Vex.

1090
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:37,861
LAURA: All right. I'm going to--

1091
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:40,125
TRAVIS: Kill some people?

1092
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:45,220
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I'm going to take a healing
potion. A superior, which is what?

1093
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:49,881
MATT: Superior would be 8d4 plus eight.

1094
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:55,949
LAURA: That's so many fours.

1095
01:26:55,949 --> 01:27:02,764
TRAVIS: It's not like you don't have 30 dice
anyway. So many dice.

1096
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:08,151
MARISHA: These fuckers, I'm so angry at them.

1097
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:25,322
LAURA: 20. Oh, 28. That's good. And then I'm going
to cast-- I'm sorry, Hunter's Mark. I'm going to

1098
01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:32,889
cast Hail of Thorns right at the one in the
middle. They're right next to each other, right?

1099
01:27:32,889 --> 01:27:37,028
MATT: Yeah. You would be scooting right over
Scanlan's head with your arrow.

1100
01:27:37,028 --> 01:27:47,187
LAURA: Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again.
Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll

1101
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:48,797
to hit on that, right?

1102
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:50,542
MATT: It would say on the spell.

1103
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:57,011
LAURA: Oh wait, that's wrong. Oh, the next time I
hit a creature. Oh, so I don't think I hit her.

1104
01:27:57,011 --> 01:27:58,209
That was 15.

1105
01:27:58,209 --> 01:27:59,652
MATT: 15 would not hit, unfortunately.

1106
01:27:59,652 --> 01:28:04,885
LAURA: Okay, then I try it again. I didn't hit her
again! It's because you're safe now, buddy.

1107
01:28:04,885 --> 01:28:09,315
MATT: So as she stands there grinning, looking
over all this, they're both amused by this whole

1108
01:28:09,315 --> 01:28:14,945
circumstance, there isn't really a glimmer of
fear. As the first arrow comes by, she leans to

1109
01:28:14,945 --> 01:28:19,581
the side, just dodges it a little bit. The second
one comes towards her, and Lord Briarwood deflects

1110
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:22,448
it out from in front of her and gives you a look
of like, don't you dare touch my woman.

1111
01:28:22,448 --> 01:28:24,822
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

1112
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:26,646
MATT: Trinket is somewhere.

1113
01:28:26,646 --> 01:28:28,609
LAURA: Okay, did he hear? I whistle again.

1114
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:30,881
MATT: You whistle again, okay. That's your turn.

1115
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:41,763
MATT: All right, so. With that, you see the
dragonborn comes flying up through the window, and

1116
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:47,294
Delilah looks back at everyone and sees everyone
rushing forward and says, "Honey, we'll deal with

1117
01:28:47,294 --> 01:28:49,859
"them. Worse comes to worst."

1118
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:53,880
And she glances up at you. "But you."

1119
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,214
ORION: I'm Tiberius Stormwind!

1120
01:28:55,214 --> 01:29:01,101
MATT: "Yes, indeed you are." As she looks at you
for a second, and there's this sparkle, this

1121
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:06,246
prismatic glow of light in her eyes. I need you--

1122
01:29:06,246 --> 01:29:11,391
ORION: 4th-level Counterspell. Were you saying
something?

1123
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:12,984
MATT: Hold on.

1124
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:20,344
MARISHA: Hold on. (laughs) I think distance makes
a difference with these people.

1125
01:29:20,344 --> 01:29:24,400
MATT: All right, so you're going to attempt to
counter. Let's do this.

1126
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,081
SAM: Dice versus dice. Wizard versus wizard.

1127
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:34,295
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, add five.

1128
01:29:34,295 --> 01:29:36,991
ORION: Seven.

1129
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,010
MATT: Yeah, that's not going to do it.

1130
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,765
LIAM: But that's a lucky number.

1131
01:29:40,765 --> 01:29:47,698
MATT: At that point, all of a sudden, you feel a
surge of arcane energy suddenly burst, not

1132
01:29:47,698 --> 01:29:51,969
visually, but on this coursing connection, almost
like two nexus points of energy. There's this

1133
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:57,191
tidal wave of arcane energy that blasts into your
mind. I need you to go ahead and make an

1134
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,620
intelligence saving throw.

1135
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,372
LIAM: Are they Superman and Wonder Woman? What the
heck?

1136
01:30:01,372 --> 01:30:04,699
LAURA: Yeah.

1137
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:06,183
ORION: 18.

1138
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:16,497
MATT: 18? 18 would unfortunately not succeed.
Yeah, you take 21 points of psychic damage--

1139
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:18,157
ORION: (yelps)

1140
01:30:18,157 --> 01:30:26,237
MATT: And your intelligence and charisma scores
become one.

1141
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:27,796
SAM: What?

1142
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:38,163
MATT: Suddenly, language leaves you. All the
spells, the nature of spellcasting, is robbed, and

1143
01:30:38,163 --> 01:30:43,171
you know where you are, but everything is
instinctual. From this point, you are essentially,

1144
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:49,111
from a communication standpoint, a giant lizard.

1145
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:57,579
ORION: (lizard noises) Am I still flying? I'm
assuming I fall.

1146
01:30:57,579 --> 01:31:03,604
MATT: At this point, actually, yeah, you do,
because you can only maintain concentration. And

1147
01:31:03,604 --> 01:31:10,641
you land on the ground. She then steps--

1148
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:12,534
ORION: Wait! Is it permanent?

1149
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:14,834
MATT: You don't know.

1150
01:31:14,834 --> 01:31:23,019
MARISHA: I can fix it. It's okay; don't worry
about it right now. I can't fix it <i>right now!</i>

1151
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:29,370
MATT: Tiberius. It's your turn.

1152
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:34,931
ORION: What the fuck can I do? Is there a saving
throw?

1153
01:31:34,931 --> 01:31:39,914
SAM: There is no save.

1154
01:31:39,914 --> 01:31:44,462
MATT: At the end of every 30 days.

1155
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:49,162
SAM: 30 <i>days?!</i> He doesn't even know what a day
is!

1156
01:31:49,162 --> 01:31:52,969
MARISHA: I can fix it. I can fix it after I sleep.
Just not right now!

1157
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:58,118
MATT: Which is what she would be saying if she was
knowing this was happening to you. So anyway. You

1158
01:31:58,118 --> 01:32:01,097
still know your friends. You know you have friends
here. You know there's something to protect. You

1159
01:32:01,097 --> 01:32:06,266
know that people need protection. You must
protect! And that's the extent of where your drive

1160
01:32:06,266 --> 01:32:07,770
is right now.

1161
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:17,830
ORION: Well, I guess-- and I'm confused as hell, I
assume?

1162
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:26,572
MATT: It's hard to say. You're still you, you're
still present there, you just know that suddenly,

1163
01:32:26,572 --> 01:32:33,826
"Spells? I don't know spells. (growls) Anger.
Frustration. Protect." It's all base instincts

1164
01:32:33,826 --> 01:32:34,650
right now.

1165
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:36,413
TRAVIS: Does he know friend from foe?

1166
01:32:36,413 --> 01:32:37,952
MATT: You don't know.

1167
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:50,935
ORION: I mean, I'm not going to do shit. You know
what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave. I'm

1168
01:32:50,935 --> 01:32:58,940
going to go out the door and back in the hallway.
And I'm going to whip around to that guy and go,

1169
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,609
(aggressive lizard noises).

1170
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:02,251
MATT: And he goes, (scared noises).

1171
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:03,722
ORION: Because I know I don't like him.

1172
01:33:03,722 --> 01:33:07,206
MATT: Right. And takes another five foot step back
from you. Unexpected feral reaction from

1173
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:08,085
Tiberius!

1174
01:33:08,085 --> 01:33:09,497
ORION: And I'm going to dash.

1175
01:33:09,497 --> 01:33:14,334
MATT: Yeah, I moved you double. Okay, that ends
your turn? Grog?

1176
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:22,814
TRAVIS: Me? I would like to run towards the
fucking Lord Sylas. Can I reach him?

1177
01:33:22,814 --> 01:33:25,870
MATT: You can't get all the way there, but you can
get within throwing range.

1178
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:31,880
TRAVIS: Throwing range only? Yeah, I'm going to
throw the hammer again.

1179
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:38,146
MATT: All right, so now you (whoosh) lob it, the
flames arcing in a circle towards him.

1180
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,580
TRAVIS: 23.

1181
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:42,818
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1182
01:33:42,818 --> 01:33:45,955
TRAVIS: 17.

1183
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:54,593
MATT: 17, all right. So (smash) the hammer hits
him in the front, the flames burst from the

1184
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:59,201
impact, you can hear the metal clang of metal
against the armor he's wearing under his outfit.

1185
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:03,151
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, sorry, d6 of flame damage! Shit.
One.

1186
01:34:03,151 --> 01:34:09,457
MATT: All right. You did 18 damage, then, good to
know. All right, so go ahead, and if you want to

1187
01:34:09,457 --> 01:34:11,346
try and retract, it's a bonus action.

1188
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:13,530
TRAVIS: I succeed.

1189
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:19,201
MATT: You pull in the chain. It whips back. Like
Thor, you catch it mid-air, prepare yourself for

1190
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:23,459
the next round. That'll be your turn. Scanlan?

1191
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:25,353
SAM: Oh. Hi.

1192
01:34:25,353 --> 01:34:29,850
MATT: You're now there, face to face. You are
essentially the shield of the group between the

1193
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:31,240
Briarwoods.

1194
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,511
SAM: Oh. Hello. What a lovely dinner we had--
Lightning!

1195
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:40,502
(laughter)

1196
01:34:40,502 --> 01:34:47,762
MATT: All right. You go to release the spell. She
immediately begins to mutter something in between.

1197
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:52,835
You immediately feel this counteractive arcane
energy. If she hadn't rolled a natural one on her

1198
01:34:52,835 --> 01:34:57,700
Counterspell, that would've been pretty bad. But
through the sheer force of frustration and anger

1199
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:02,020
at this point now, the lightning bolt presses
through her counter, and the bolt is released in

1200
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:04,206
that direction, arcing towards both of them.

1201
01:35:04,206 --> 01:35:05,425
SAM: Wait, she rolled a one?

1202
01:35:05,425 --> 01:35:07,268
MATT: She rolled a one to try and counter your
spell.

1203
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:10,068
LIAM: Please make it funny.

1204
01:35:10,068 --> 01:35:15,190
SAM: Oh, so wait, I get to roll for damage now?
It's a bunch of d6s right? 8d6.

1205
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:17,483
MATT: 8d6. And for their saving throws--

1206
01:35:17,483 --> 01:35:19,093
SAM: Can I arc it so it hits both of them?

1207
01:35:19,093 --> 01:35:20,480
MATT: Yeah, it would hit them both.

1208
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,040
SAM: Would it also hit Mr. Awesome?

1209
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,287
MATT: No, he's off to the left.

1210
01:35:23,287 --> 01:35:24,385
SAM: Okay.

1211
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:32,483
MATT: All right. So they do both make their saving
throw, so they both take half damage.

1212
01:35:32,483 --> 01:35:37,733
LAURA: Of course they do. Hate them!

1213
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:38,953
SAM: 32?

1214
01:35:38,953 --> 01:35:48,068
MATT: 32, okay. That's a 16 to Sylas and eight to
Lady Delilah.

1215
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:50,002
SAM: Wow, she can take half of half?

1216
01:35:50,002 --> 01:35:51,146
MATT: Apparently.

1217
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:52,613
LAURA: Magic resistance.

1218
01:35:52,613 --> 01:36:01,646
MATT: Both of them (impact sounds) take the blast
from the-- and you see this look of: okay, things

1219
01:36:01,646 --> 01:36:05,973
are getting a little weird now. They both look at
each other with a realizing they're now a front of

1220
01:36:05,973 --> 01:36:10,975
two against many swarming individuals. Do you want
to move or stay where you are?

1221
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:18,527
SAM: I will move backwards. By a lot. And have I
seen the tiefling?

1222
01:36:18,527 --> 01:36:23,803
MATT: You have not. Oh no, you did. You flew past
as you went and you were like: what the heck is

1223
01:36:23,803 --> 01:36:25,531
that? And then you pulled out.

1224
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:27,836
SAM: But I don't have eyes on her? So I can't inspire
her?

1225
01:36:27,836 --> 01:36:29,148
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

1226
01:36:29,148 --> 01:36:40,345
SAM: All right, well then, I will inspire Keyleth.
(singing) Can you feel the blood tonight? That's

1227
01:36:40,345 --> 01:36:44,146
it, that's all I got. (laughs) All right. So
you're inspired.

1228
01:36:44,146 --> 01:36:48,623
MARISHA: Thanks. I get a d10 right? Ha! Okay.

1229
01:36:48,623 --> 01:36:55,582
MATT: All right, so that ends your turn. That
brings us to you.

1230
01:36:55,582 --> 01:37:03,509
KIT: Okay, I'm starting to get a bit pissed now.
My tail is whipping, and I would like to use

1231
01:37:03,509 --> 01:37:04,916
Phantasmal Killer.

1232
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:06,598
MARISHA: What is that?!

1233
01:37:06,598 --> 01:37:08,908
KIT: To Lord Briarwood. Again.

1234
01:37:08,908 --> 01:37:10,494
MARISHA: That sounds awesome.

1235
01:37:10,494 --> 01:37:12,024
SAM: Her accent is so fake.

1236
01:37:12,024 --> 01:37:15,927
KIT: (exaggerated American accent) I know, right?

1237
01:37:15,927 --> 01:37:19,614
MATT: So are you staying at the edge of the
bed, or are you going towards the window to have a

1238
01:37:19,614 --> 01:37:20,698
clear view?

1239
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:21,989
KIT: I'll move forward a bit.

1240
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:24,084
MATT: All right, so you leap off the side of the
bed, come up to the edge of the broken window,

1241
01:37:24,084 --> 01:37:37,830
looking down towards it. All right! Let's try and
make this wisdom saving throw. Chose to make his

1242
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:39,575
save, using his legendary resistance.

1243
01:37:39,575 --> 01:37:44,384
LAURA: Wait, how many times does he get that damn
thing?

1244
01:37:44,384 --> 01:37:46,872
TRAVIS: He's like a dragon!

1245
01:37:46,872 --> 01:37:49,449
KIT: It's fine, I'll wear him out.

1246
01:37:49,449 --> 01:37:55,924
MATT: Remember, the target still becomes
frightened for the duration. So now, as you do

1247
01:37:55,924 --> 01:38:01,936
this and look up, Lord Briarwood has had this
cocky grin the whole time, sees this sudden albino

1248
01:38:01,936 --> 01:38:08,057
tiefling in the window glare down and send
this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from

1249
01:38:08,376 --> 01:38:14,137
above. The echo of the hiss hits Lord Briarwood
and for the first time, you see him recoil in

1250
01:38:14,137 --> 01:38:19,506
strange momentary terror and seems to almost step
back into the side of his wife. Glances over his

1251
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:27,686
shoulder towards her and she gives him a look of
misunderstanding and acknowledgement. So he cannot

1252
01:38:27,686 --> 01:38:31,461
get near you, currently. Cannot get any closer to
you and has disadvantage

1253
01:38:31,461 --> 01:38:33,054
against anything against you.

1254
01:38:33,054 --> 01:38:34,718
TRAVIS: Just her or us?

1255
01:38:34,718 --> 01:38:36,144
MATT: Just her.

1256
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:40,962
TRAVIS: Clap hands.

1257
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:44,157
MATT: All right. Very cool. So that's your turn on
that one. Percy.

1258
01:38:44,157 --> 01:38:45,599
MARISHA: Percy!

1259
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:53,669
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a standard walking
speed 30 feet straight ahead. Swinging Bad News

1260
01:38:53,669 --> 01:39:00,165
back onto my back, pulling out Pepperbox. Sylas!
I'm getting his attention again. I'm going to

1261
01:39:00,165 --> 01:39:01,794
start shooting with--

1262
01:39:01,794 --> 01:39:03,374
SAM: Are you still in disguise?

1263
01:39:03,374 --> 01:39:04,573
TALIESIN: No, I don't think anymore.

1264
01:39:04,573 --> 01:39:06,666
MATT: No, the moment you fired, the illusion
dissipated.

1265
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:11,891
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I'm going to be using my
sharpshooter for this.

1266
01:39:11,891 --> 01:39:13,842
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1267
01:39:13,842 --> 01:39:19,443
TALIESIN: That's 26 to hit.

1268
01:39:19,443 --> 01:39:21,044
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1269
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:35,190
TALIESIN: So that's, let's see. Oh, I need one of
these, too. That's 22 points of damage and one

1270
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:36,569
point of fire damage.

1271
01:39:36,569 --> 01:39:37,987
MATT: All right.

1272
01:39:37,987 --> 01:39:41,599
TALIESIN: Same thing again.

1273
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:46,313
MATT: So you've shot, reload, shot. And this
turn--

1274
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,007
TALIESIN: No, I put Bad News away. Bad News is
empty.

1275
01:39:49,007 --> 01:39:53,311
MATT: Oh, so Bad News is empty. That's the first
shot. You got this. Cool. Sorry, I misunderstood.

1276
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:55,365
TALIESIN: Ain't going to be a dick about it.

1277
01:39:55,365 --> 01:39:57,106
MATT: All right, so this is the first shot. Second
shot.

1278
01:39:57,106 --> 01:40:00,856
TALIESIN: 25?

1279
01:40:00,856 --> 01:40:02,158
MATT: 25 hits.

1280
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:08,432
TALIESIN: That's 21 points of damage.

1281
01:40:08,432 --> 01:40:09,827
MATT: All righty.

1282
01:40:09,827 --> 01:40:11,588
TALIESIN: Shooting again.

1283
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:12,976
MATT: All right.

1284
01:40:12,976 --> 01:40:14,248
TALIESIN: 18.

1285
01:40:14,248 --> 01:40:19,091
MATT: 18 does not hit. The first shot (impact) off
the shoulder and the second one (impact) hits the

1286
01:40:19,091 --> 01:40:23,777
same point where Bad News hit the arm, blasting
off another portion of the flesh. And the third

1287
01:40:23,777 --> 01:40:28,702
one, this time, you can actually see the shadows
coalesce around him and the shot just misses

1288
01:40:28,702 --> 01:40:36,133
through the darkness and reforms into the physical
form of Sylas. As you're finishing your turn,

1289
01:40:36,133 --> 01:40:46,443
that, you can see, Sylas' flesh is reforming and
healing rapidly from the damage he's taken. The

1290
01:40:46,443 --> 01:40:51,621
actual tendons are forming back up from the blast
damage. He's looking at you with a slight

1291
01:40:51,621 --> 01:41:00,347
grin but then nervously back at the tiefling in
the window. Back and forth. At this point in time,

1292
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:08,454
Asum is going to go ahead and back up this way and
is going to use an action to hide. Rolls a three.

1293
01:41:08,454 --> 01:41:23,695
Terrible. Absolutely useless. All right, so Sylas
now is going to angrily look around and pulls off

1294
01:41:23,695 --> 01:41:30,685
from the back, you can see this shimmer as there
was an illusion dissipates and what previously

1295
01:41:30,685 --> 01:41:38,051
looked like it was an empty back, a large scabbard
appears. Pulling this giant dark, slate-gray

1296
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:43,335
greatsword from the back and lunges forward
towards you, Grog.

1297
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,083
MARISHA: Sylas?

1298
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,898
LAURA: Did someone ever get Uriel?

1299
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:59,690
MATT: You have not seen Uriel, no. All right. Is
going to then make a strike at you.

1300
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:04,140
That's a 26 to hit.

1301
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,313
TRAVIS: Hits.

1302
01:42:05,313 --> 01:42:18,933
MATT: All right. You take 12 points of slashing
damage. Reduced to six. And I need you to go ahead

1303
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:21,418
and make a constitution saving throw.

1304
01:42:21,418 --> 01:42:26,494
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage on those if I'm
raging?

1305
01:42:26,494 --> 01:42:28,002
MATT: No, you just have a high constitution.

1306
01:42:28,002 --> 01:42:30,798
SAM: He still has disadvantage on attacks, right?
That wore off?

1307
01:42:30,798 --> 01:42:32,031
TRAVIS: 18.

1308
01:42:32,031 --> 01:42:36,890
MATT: 18, all right. You feel like the actual
wound from the blade is attempting to draw some force

1309
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:43,147
from your body, but you just (grunts) and flex and
whatever arcane enchantment is resisted. Turns

1310
01:42:43,147 --> 01:42:48,534
around for a second swipe, that is going to be a
19.

1311
01:42:48,534 --> 01:42:49,724
TRAVIS: Hits.

1312
01:42:49,724 --> 01:42:58,081
MATT: Hits? All right. You take 15 points of
slashing damage. Half that to seven, or be eight.

1313
01:42:58,081 --> 01:43:01,085
Round up for use. So eight. And make another
constitution saving throw.

1314
01:43:01,085 --> 01:43:04,917
TRAVIS: Damn it. Ha! Even better. 21.

1315
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:08,186
MATT: Yeah, once again. There's some sort of
enchantment that's trying to pull from the wounds

1316
01:43:08,186 --> 01:43:13,969
as it hits you and you just grin them off with
this chuckle. So he's going to use the rest of his

1317
01:43:13,969 --> 01:43:18,844
movement to step back a little bit. You get an
attack of opportunity.

1318
01:43:18,844 --> 01:43:19,718
TRAVIS: I do?

1319
01:43:19,718 --> 01:43:21,808
MATT: Yes, you do. With the hammer.

1320
01:43:21,808 --> 01:43:25,988
TRAVIS: Yes! That's 24.

1321
01:43:25,988 --> 01:43:27,577
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1322
01:43:27,577 --> 01:43:38,470
TRAVIS: Awesome. That's 11, plus four points of
fire damage, so 15.

1323
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,970
MATT: Okay, 15. Cool.

1324
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:45,128
That ends his turn. Keyleth.

1325
01:43:45,128 --> 01:43:49,130
MARISHA: My turn? Okay. Wait, where did Briarwood
go? Lord Briarwood.

1326
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:50,465
TALIESIN and MATT: Right there.

1327
01:43:50,465 --> 01:43:58,666
MARISHA: Oh, he backed up. Beautiful. So I take my
staff and I crack it on the ground. Where I

1328
01:43:58,666 --> 01:44:05,040
cracked it, little ice crystals start forming
against the ground and start making ice and I'm

1329
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:10,533
going to cast Sleet Storm. I need a thing.

1330
01:44:10,533 --> 01:44:12,329
SAM: I have a 20. What do you want?

1331
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,420
MARISHA: No I need a--

1332
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,567
SAM: What do you need?

1333
01:44:14,567 --> 01:44:21,771
MARISHA: A laser pointer! There you go. So it's a
40-foot radius. Starting where Briarwood is.

1334
01:44:21,771 --> 01:44:24,207
MATT: All righty. A 40-foot radius.

1335
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:27,601
MARISHA: Right. Starting in this line. Grog's not
in it.

1336
01:44:27,601 --> 01:44:29,405
MATT: This way, you mean?

1337
01:44:29,405 --> 01:44:31,139
MARISHA: From here back.

1338
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:35,774
MATT: So Sleet Storm (boom) right in that area
right there. So as you slam the ground, the ice

1339
01:44:35,774 --> 01:44:40,096
begins to move around and all of a sudden the
cold air begins to form this almost like mist as

1340
01:44:40,096 --> 01:44:43,751
the temperature shift suddenly impacts the
surrounding vicinity. The grass freezes in place,

1341
01:44:43,751 --> 01:44:47,414
and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to
rain down in the vicinity.

1342
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:55,694
MARISHA: So the ground in the area is difficult
terrain. It is covered with slick ice. When a

1343
01:44:55,694 --> 01:45:00,614
creature enters the spell's area for a first time
or on its turn starts its turn there, it must make

1344
01:45:00,614 --> 01:45:05,124
a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked
prone, because they slip and fall. If a creature

1345
01:45:05,124 --> 01:45:09,332
is concentrating in the spell's area the creature
must make a successful concentration saving throw

1346
01:45:09,332 --> 01:45:11,841
against your spell's DC or lose concentration.

1347
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:13,031
MATT: Good to know.

1348
01:45:13,031 --> 01:45:14,504
SAM: And you have inspiration.

1349
01:45:14,504 --> 01:45:21,023
MATT: Cool. All righty. So?

1350
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:23,314
MARISHA: And then I move back.

1351
01:45:23,314 --> 01:45:28,289
MATT: That ends your turn. Vax.

1352
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:37,025
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to throw one dagger at
Briarwood's face.

1353
01:45:37,025 --> 01:45:39,691
MATT: All right. Go for it.

1354
01:45:39,691 --> 01:45:49,133
LIAM: That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two
potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack.

1355
01:45:49,133 --> 01:45:52,246
MATT: No. The additional action is not so much a
potion.

1356
01:45:52,246 --> 01:45:58,691
LIAM: All right, so I'm taking a potion of greater
healing and walking backward. Walking distance.

1357
01:45:58,691 --> 01:46:01,652
And greater healing is 4d4, right?

1358
01:46:01,652 --> 01:46:08,907
MATT: Greater healing is 4d4 plus four, yeah. All
right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.

1359
01:46:08,907 --> 01:46:18,636
LAURA: Yes. Knowing that they seem to be vampires
because they've fucking creepy teeth, I'm going to

1360
01:46:18,636 --> 01:46:27,747
pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at--
Lord Briarwood's in the way of Lady Briarwood

1361
01:46:27,747 --> 01:46:29,339
now, isn't he?

1362
01:46:29,339 --> 01:46:32,857
MATT: You can try and shoot either if you want to
move over to the side and get a better view.

1363
01:46:32,857 --> 01:46:35,187
LAURA: Well I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on
him.

1364
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:36,759
MATT: On him? Okay.

1365
01:46:36,759 --> 01:46:43,508
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot my holy arrow
through my Blazing Bowstring one more time.

1366
01:46:43,508 --> 01:46:45,083
MATT: Okay go for it.

1367
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:53,791
LAURA: Come on! Hold on! 28.

1368
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:55,797
MATT: 28 does hit.

1369
01:46:55,797 --> 01:47:00,771
LAURA: Okay, good. Do I do any additional damage
with my holy arrow?

1370
01:47:00,771 --> 01:47:13,866
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for the arrow. And
you do an additional 2d6 radiant damage to Lord

1371
01:47:13,866 --> 01:47:14,819
Briarwood.

1372
01:47:14,819 --> 01:47:27,555
LAURA: Oh wait. 15, 19. Plus ten for the Blazing
Bowstring, so 22, and then what did you say?

1373
01:47:27,555 --> 01:47:29,342
MATT: 2d6 radiant damage.

1374
01:47:29,342 --> 01:47:34,492
LAURA: Seven more, so 29 damage.

1375
01:47:34,492 --> 01:47:38,635
MATT: Okay, good to know. So as the arrow impacts,
(impact sound) he puts up his cloak to guard in

1376
01:47:38,635 --> 01:47:43,919
time, as it goes (whooshing) through the cloak,
you hear this (grunts) in pain as the arrow

1377
01:47:43,919 --> 01:47:48,345
bursts, and as the cloak comes back, you can see
this burning sensation across the front of Lord

1378
01:47:48,345 --> 01:47:54,032
Briarwood. Where the flesh was healing and sewing
itself up, that has been halted immediately by the

1379
01:47:54,032 --> 01:47:57,156
impact of the holy water, which is beginning to
pockmark and burn his flesh.

1380
01:47:57,156 --> 01:48:06,044
LAURA: Awesome. Then I'm going to hit him again!
(laughs) So yes, I'm going to do the same thing!

1381
01:48:06,044 --> 01:48:08,084
Except I'm out of my Blazing Bowstring; it fizzled
out.

1382
01:48:08,084 --> 01:48:09,385
MATT: Yes.

1383
01:48:09,385 --> 01:48:11,826
LAURA: Okay that's a 29 to hit.

1384
01:48:11,826 --> 01:48:13,038
MATT: That'll hit.

1385
01:48:13,038 --> 01:48:21,094
LAURA: Okay. That's good. Plus two radiant
damage.

1386
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:23,993
MATT: That's your second holy arrow, right?

1387
01:48:23,993 --> 01:48:25,031
LAURA: Yeah.

1388
01:48:25,031 --> 01:48:27,631
LIAM: What was it before that?

1389
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:35,748
LAURA: 17. 28. And then another d6 for my Hunter's
Mark. 32!

1390
01:48:35,748 --> 01:48:42,666
MATT: Nice. Second one (impact) shatters and you
can see now, like part of the jaw is hurt and

1391
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:49,839
wounded. (panting) There's this wild frenzy
to his face as you can see Lord Briarwood is

1392
01:48:49,839 --> 01:48:53,135
starting to look a little ragged. All right. That
ends your turn.

1393
01:48:53,135 --> 01:48:54,470
LAURA: Yes.

1394
01:48:54,470 --> 01:49:01,484
MATT: Lady Delilah Briarwood steps forward up to
the back of her husband.

1395
01:49:01,484 --> 01:49:04,080
MARISHA: She's got to make a dex throw.

1396
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:16,246
MATT: She does. And against the spell, 'cause it's
magic, she gets advantage. That would be an 18.

1397
01:49:16,246 --> 01:49:17,288
What's the DC?

1398
01:49:17,288 --> 01:49:19,756
MARISHA: It just says they just have to make a
dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone.

1399
01:49:19,756 --> 01:49:21,395
MATT: Right, but it's against your DC of your
spell.

1400
01:49:21,395 --> 01:49:23,169
MARISHA: Oh, is it? 18.

1401
01:49:23,169 --> 01:49:27,096
MATT: So yeah, she makes it. So she steps forward;
almost slips, but catches herself on the shoulder

1402
01:49:27,096 --> 01:49:31,646
of her husband and says, "My dear, I fear it's
time that we make our leave."

1403
01:49:31,646 --> 01:49:33,265
SAM: Make our leave?

1404
01:49:33,265 --> 01:49:35,013
MARISHA: No, they're going to bamf!

1405
01:49:35,013 --> 01:49:39,503
MATT: Casts Dimension Door. Both of them (whoosh)
out of visible range.

1406
01:49:39,503 --> 01:49:47,367
SAM: Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's
Mark tell you where they went? They just

1407
01:49:47,367 --> 01:49:48,236
disappeared. Where'd they go?

1408
01:49:48,236 --> 01:49:49,481
LAURA: They fucking disappeared?

1409
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:50,952
TALIESIN and MARISHA: They Dimension Doored out.

1410
01:49:50,952 --> 01:49:53,044
LAURA: I do have Hunter's Mark on him.

1411
01:49:53,044 --> 01:49:58,940
MATT: On him, yes. You sense that they're not that
far from you. They're around the corner where you

1412
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,782
guys came from.

1413
01:50:00,782 --> 01:50:04,211
LAURA: They're right there! Do we want to keep
fighting them?

1414
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:09,140
LIAM: He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get
them, we need to get them now! Lead the way,

1415
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:10,339
Percival!

1416
01:50:10,339 --> 01:50:11,438
LAURA: They're around the corner.

1417
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:15,463
MARISHA: I can probably teleport us through a tree,
right?

1418
01:50:15,463 --> 01:50:16,879
SAM: That's okay, we'll just run.

1419
01:50:16,879 --> 01:50:18,100
LAURA: They're right there.

1420
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:21,916
MATT: As you guys rush around the corner you can
see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway,

1421
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:27,281
the carriage that they came in is now gaining
speed--

1422
01:50:27,281 --> 01:50:30,104
TALIESIN: Sharpshoot right now. I'm going to try
and take out a wheel.

1423
01:50:30,104 --> 01:50:37,050
TRAVIS: (yelling) Close the gates!

1424
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:40,044
TALIESIN: 27.

1425
01:50:40,044 --> 01:50:42,401
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1426
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:43,808
ORION: Nice.

1427
01:50:43,808 --> 01:50:52,378
TALIESIN: 20 points of damage.

1428
01:50:52,378 --> 01:51:00,523
MATT: 20 points of damage, all right. The wheel
splinters and (grinding sound) is now coasting on

1429
01:51:00,523 --> 01:51:03,743
the ground. The young gentleman who is currently
on the top is looking over his shoulder, trying

1430
01:51:03,743 --> 01:51:05,581
desperately to usher them away.

1431
01:51:05,581 --> 01:51:07,217
MARISHA: How, roughly, far away are they?

1432
01:51:07,217 --> 01:51:09,746
MATT: Right now, they're about a hundred feet--

1433
01:51:09,746 --> 01:51:11,514
LAURA: Is Trinket anywhere near them?

1434
01:51:11,514 --> 01:51:15,647
MATT: Trinket was over at the stables on the far back
of the palace, unfortunately.

1435
01:51:15,647 --> 01:51:18,384
MARISHA: I still have my Sleet Storm up. It's a
concentration spell.

1436
01:51:18,384 --> 01:51:19,879
I'm going to move it over there.

1437
01:51:19,879 --> 01:51:22,235
MATT: Can you just shift it over there?

1438
01:51:22,235 --> 01:51:23,941
MARISHA: Yeah. It's a concentration spell. It
lasts a minute.

1439
01:51:23,941 --> 01:51:26,040
MATT: Oh well no, it's concentration to keep it in
the area.

1440
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,371
MARISHA: Well, then I cast it again.

1441
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:29,655
MATT: So you're casting Sleet Storm again. What's
the range on it?

1442
01:51:29,655 --> 01:51:30,868
MARISHA: 150 feet.

1443
01:51:30,868 --> 01:51:36,279
MATT: 150 feet. The sleet storm lands down. The
cobblestone becomes sleek; the carriage begins

1444
01:51:36,279 --> 01:51:42,004
rocking back and forth. However, it does manage to
keep on its course, currently; it does not get

1445
01:51:42,004 --> 01:51:46,883
knocked prone. It's hard to knock a carriage
prone, but it is sliding out of the way.

1446
01:51:46,883 --> 01:51:49,815
TALIESIN: Is that a disadvantage because it only
has three wheels?

1447
01:51:49,815 --> 01:51:51,744
MATT: Good call, actually.

1448
01:51:51,744 --> 01:51:53,053
MARISHA: And it's rough terrain?

1449
01:51:53,053 --> 01:51:54,130
MATT: That is a two.

1450
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:55,764
(cheering)

1451
01:51:55,764 --> 01:52:04,852
MATT: At this point, the carriage (crash) slams
onto the side of the ground and skids (creaking)

1452
01:52:04,852 --> 01:52:10,415
to a halt in the middle of the ice, the sleet
still spackling down as you guys all turn the

1453
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:14,458
corner now; as you approach. The gates have closed
(slamming) as the guards have slammed it,

1454
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:24,221
listening to Grog on the far side. The door pops
open on the side of the carriage. Tiberius, as

1455
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:29,044
you've made your way back around and you're at the
front now, (panting) and you can see now, about 60

1456
01:52:29,044 --> 01:52:33,596
feet in front of you the carriage is overturned in
the middle of this sleet storm, on the ground.

1457
01:52:33,596 --> 01:52:36,005
ORION: Where is it?

1458
01:52:36,005 --> 01:52:42,548
MATT: From a visual standpoint, you're about 60 to
70 feet from the front of this. The doors slam

1459
01:52:42,548 --> 01:52:45,534
open and you can see Lord and Lady Briarwood step out.

1460
01:52:45,534 --> 01:52:47,823
LAURA: Can I shoot my exploding arrow?

1461
01:52:47,823 --> 01:52:57,502
MATT: Hold on. As you've guys are just turning
the corner. You can see now Lord Briarwood stands

1462
01:52:57,502 --> 01:53:03,741
up and is trying to compose himself, ruffles himself up
angrily, looking at his damaged circumstance. Lady

1463
01:53:03,741 --> 01:53:11,762
Briarwood's against his shoulder and she goes,
(clicks tongue) "Well, (sighs) at the very least,

1464
01:53:11,762 --> 01:53:20,566
"I think you should come visit us sometime, Percy.
You're always welcome back home. It'd be nice of

1465
01:53:20,566 --> 01:53:26,423
"you to visit your family once in a while." Roll
initiative. Just you. As you were the first action

1466
01:53:26,423 --> 01:53:27,802
to take.

1467
01:53:27,802 --> 01:53:31,733
LAURA: 19.

1468
01:53:31,733 --> 01:53:37,952
MATT: 19? Go ahead and roll. Roll the attack for
the exploding arrow. This is against Lady

1469
01:53:37,952 --> 01:53:38,882
Briarwood?

1470
01:53:38,882 --> 01:53:41,387
LAURA: 29. It's against her.

1471
01:53:41,387 --> 01:53:42,740
MATT: Yeah, 29'll hit.

1472
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:48,385
LAURA: What do I do damage for the exploding
arrow? That Percy made, by the way.

1473
01:53:48,385 --> 01:53:49,971
MATT: Yeah. Roll for your--

1474
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:53,592
LAURA: 16.

1475
01:53:53,592 --> 01:54:05,652
MATT: So 16 regular arrow damage? Okay, against
Lady Briarwood. Cool. All right, and then for the

1476
01:54:05,652 --> 01:54:13,131
additional blast that blows up it's additional 4d6
blast damage to her and they both get saving

1477
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:15,258
throws to try and halve it.

1478
01:54:15,258 --> 01:54:17,026
LAURA: Okay I'm rolling one of our Critical Role
dice.

1479
01:54:17,026 --> 01:54:18,547
MATT: So half damage to both of them.

1480
01:54:18,547 --> 01:54:20,363
SAM: Trademark!

1481
01:54:20,363 --> 01:54:21,857
LAURA: Damn it.

1482
01:54:21,857 --> 01:54:23,728
SAM: Critical fail!

1483
01:54:23,728 --> 01:54:25,437
LAURA: 11.

1484
01:54:25,437 --> 01:54:34,012
MATT: 11? So half that, six damage to each. She
needs to make a concentration check. Advantage on

1485
01:54:34,012 --> 01:54:39,791
that for war caster. Yeah, that's a 19. Okay. So
(explosion), a portion of the outside of the

1486
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:46,512
carriage just blows apart. Wood shrapnel goes
flying to each other side. As the smoke settles

1487
01:54:46,512 --> 01:54:51,352
and the explosion, you can see, both Lord and Lady
Briarwood are still standing there, seemingly

1488
01:54:51,352 --> 01:54:59,666
unscathed by the event. She wraps her arms around
him and whispers in his ear, "It's all right." And

1489
01:54:59,666 --> 01:55:08,833
they both (whoosh) vanish in a swirl of arcane
energy. You don't recognize it because right now

1490
01:55:08,833 --> 01:55:11,133
you don't have the intelligence to really--

1491
01:55:11,133 --> 01:55:13,457
TALIESIN: I want to walk over to the carriage
driver.

1492
01:55:13,457 --> 01:55:19,868
MATT: You walk over to the carriage driver, who is
currently on the ground, this young man who's

1493
01:55:19,868 --> 01:55:25,569
horribly hurt, part of his torso is burned, and
he's like, (coughs, grunts). Trying to climb away.

1494
01:55:25,569 --> 01:55:34,959
(gasping) "Please, please spare my life, please.
What do you want from me?" (labored breathing)

1495
01:55:34,959 --> 01:55:39,966
TALIESIN: What do you know?

1496
01:55:39,966 --> 01:55:43,190
MATT: "About what?"

1497
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:45,493
TALIESIN: I shoot him in the right hand.

1498
01:55:45,493 --> 01:55:53,785
MATT: (gunshot, screams) It's an easy enough hit,
he's prone before you. Three of his fingers are

1499
01:55:53,785 --> 01:56:00,085
blown off, and the bloody stumps. (gasps, grunts)
Shaking. (panting) "I'm sorry. I don't-- look-- "

1500
01:56:00,085 --> 01:56:02,499
TALIESIN: You're from Whitestone, yes?

1501
01:56:02,499 --> 01:56:07,345
MATT: "I am. You don't know what it's like. I had
no choice."

1502
01:56:07,345 --> 01:56:11,787
TALIESIN: Well, you do now. I reload again and put
it on his left hand.

1503
01:56:11,787 --> 01:56:19,745
MATT: "Please don't, please." The rest of you are
gathered, and you step out from the edge of the

1504
01:56:19,745 --> 01:56:22,947
window and make your way with the rest of the
crowd, and they're watching this display on the

1505
01:56:22,947 --> 01:56:23,846
front of the palace.

1506
01:56:23,846 --> 01:56:25,208
TALIESIN: Frederick de Rolo.

1507
01:56:25,208 --> 01:56:29,261
MATT: "Yes?"

1508
01:56:29,261 --> 01:56:31,445
TALIESIN: Where is he?

1509
01:56:31,445 --> 01:56:35,622
MATT: "He's gone. He's gone, sir. I'm sorry."

1510
01:56:35,622 --> 01:56:39,197
TALIESIN: Lady Johanna.

1511
01:56:39,197 --> 01:56:42,321
MATT: "They're all gone. Sir, they all--"

1512
01:56:42,321 --> 01:56:44,071
TALIESIN: Julius de Rolo.

1513
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:45,465
MATT: "I don't know."

1514
01:56:45,465 --> 01:56:46,940
TALIESIN: Vesper de Rolo.

1515
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:47,814
MATT: "I don't--"

1516
01:56:47,814 --> 01:56:51,766
TALIESIN: Whitney de Rolo. Ludwig de Rolo. Oliver
de Rolo.

1517
01:56:51,766 --> 01:56:59,336
MATT: "Your family is gone, sir. They were taken.
They were killed. I'm sorry."

1518
01:56:59,336 --> 01:57:02,190
TALIESIN: You will tell us everything you've
seen.

1519
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:09,760
MATT: "They'll find me, sir. They'll kill me."

1520
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:17,584
TALIESIN: No, they won't. Because I will kill you
first. Tell me what you've seen.

1521
01:57:17,584 --> 01:57:21,486
MATT: And with that we're going to go to break.

1522
01:57:21,486 --> 01:57:23,248
(yelling)

1523
01:57:23,248 --> 01:57:25,750
LIAM: Wow.

1524
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:28,923
LAURA: You're not dead!

1525
01:57:28,923 --> 01:57:30,450
KIT: Yay!

1526
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:33,492
TALIESIN: Thank you for not dying!

1527
01:57:33,492 --> 01:57:37,525
LAURA: Hopefully, you won't turn into a vampire.
You did get bit.

1528
01:57:37,525 --> 01:57:41,914
ORION: I think that works, is like, if it goes all
the way down to zero--

1529
01:57:41,914 --> 02:08:21,182
[break]

1530
02:08:21,182 --> 02:08:25,266
MATT: Welcome back, guys. Couple of quick things
before we jump into this. One, we are 38 subs from

1534
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:38,100
MARISHA: Have you guys seen them? They're
awesome.

1535
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:41,657
MATT: It's pretty awesome, it's a wonderful piece
of art of Keyleth transforming into an earth

1536
02:08:41,657 --> 02:08:46,430
elemental and attacking K'Varn in the K'Varn
fight. So yeah, we have that coming up. Also we

1537
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:52,237
have the winner of our shirt giveaway tonight. The
winner is one Blair Beverage!

1538
02:08:52,237 --> 02:08:54,674
(cheering)

1539
02:08:54,674 --> 02:08:58,353
MATT: Free shirt. We'll get this to you, so
congratulations and thanks for watching tonight.

1540
02:08:58,353 --> 02:09:02,629
LIAM: Real talk, the winner here tonight is me.

1541
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:05,013
MATT: I was so scared.

1542
02:09:05,013 --> 02:09:06,891
TALIESIN: You win another day.

1543
02:09:06,891 --> 02:09:09,881
MARISHA: It's been one of the most emotional
nights of my life.

1544
02:09:09,881 --> 02:09:15,604
MATT: So. As you all begin to gather around on the
front of the courtyard of the palace, you can see

1545
02:09:15,604 --> 02:09:22,383
some of the guards start rushing out amongst the
splinters of this carriage that has been royally

1546
02:09:22,383 --> 02:09:24,187
destroyed by many of you.

1547
02:09:24,187 --> 02:09:26,680
ORION: Do I see that everybody's safe?

1548
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:29,324
MATT: Yeah, you get the sense that there is no
immediate danger.

1549
02:09:29,324 --> 02:09:36,761
ORION: Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and
sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go

1550
02:09:36,761 --> 02:09:37,703
find her.

1551
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:38,666
MATT: Okay.

1552
02:09:38,666 --> 02:09:40,401
MARISHA: Do we see him go find her?

1553
02:09:40,401 --> 02:09:44,358
MATT: You guys currently are too engrossed with
Percy currently pinning a young boy on the ground

1554
02:09:44,358 --> 02:09:45,726
and shooting his hand off.

1555
02:09:45,726 --> 02:09:46,559
MARISHA: Okay.

1556
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:52,705
MATT: He's currently like, "Please. What do you
need? Just let me go. Please."

1557
02:09:52,705 --> 02:09:58,195
TALIESIN: I want you to spend the rest of your
life making up for the things you've allowed to

1558
02:09:58,195 --> 02:10:01,966
happen. I now take the butt of my gun and I'm
going to knock him unconscious.

1559
02:10:01,966 --> 02:10:03,118
MATT: Okay.

1560
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:07,843
TALIESIN: I don't quite know. I'm just rolling,
but I'd normally get 21.

1561
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:12,219
MATT: 21, at the point of life he has left
(whack). Yeah, he just (impact) falls and crumples

1562
02:10:12,219 --> 02:10:14,666
to the ground unconscious, pool of blood forming.

1563
02:10:14,666 --> 02:10:16,487
TALIESIN: Are there soldiers coming?

1564
02:10:16,487 --> 02:10:18,808
MATT: There are guards coming now from the
palace.

1565
02:10:18,808 --> 02:10:20,966
TALIESIN: Put him in a cell.

1566
02:10:20,966 --> 02:10:23,998
MARISHA: Wait, we can put him in our cell.

1567
02:10:23,998 --> 02:10:25,561
LAURA: Yeah, put him in our cell.

1568
02:10:25,561 --> 02:10:29,807
MARISHA: We'll bring him to Greyskull Keep.

1569
02:10:29,807 --> 02:10:31,246
LAURA: But make sure he doesn't bleed out first.

1570
02:10:31,246 --> 02:10:36,509
MARISHA: He's fine. He's not bleeding. It was
non-lethal damage, right; he's not bleeding out.

1571
02:10:36,509 --> 02:10:39,374
MATT: Well, not from the head but he is missing
three fingers from one hand and is currently

1572
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:40,425
pooling.

1573
02:10:40,425 --> 02:10:44,248
MARISHA: All right, I'll solder up his wounds a
bit, make sure he doesn't die.

1574
02:10:44,248 --> 02:10:48,893
MATT: Okay, so taking care of that. He's
unconscious. You guys all take a moment to breathe

1575
02:10:48,893 --> 02:10:54,006
in and realize the danger that just transpired.
The Briarwoods got away. God knows where they're

1576
02:10:54,006 --> 02:11:00,150
off to. You gather somewhere back in their
territory, on their own turf. And you all look

1577
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:06,074
about at the guards gathering, making questions,
and there are now two guards very intensely

1578
02:11:06,074 --> 02:11:12,155
harrying this tiefling that showed up out of
nowhere and began aiding the battle. You see now,

1579
02:11:12,155 --> 02:11:17,175
one guard has an arm going to your shoulder and
says, "You, what's your name? What's your business

1580
02:11:17,175 --> 02:11:20,213
"here? You do not have approval to be here at the
palace."

1581
02:11:20,213 --> 02:11:24,606
KIT: I have been working here for months. You did
not notice?

1582
02:11:24,606 --> 02:11:30,246
MATT: "I think we would notice a tiefling in our
midst. You're under arrest. Throw her in the cell."

1583
02:11:30,246 --> 02:11:36,776
LIAM: I walk forward and slap my hand on the
guard's arm and say, we saved Uriel, you will

1584
02:11:36,776 --> 02:11:42,126
stand down now. Uriel would not be alive if not
for the people around you now.

1585
02:11:42,126 --> 02:11:45,578
She's fine. Walk away.

1586
02:11:45,578 --> 02:11:50,270
MATT: The guard gives you a look and says, "As far
as we know right now, you both, all of you,

1587
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:56,237
"attacked two of our guests in the center of our
own palace. They managed to flee. We're going to

1588
02:11:56,237 --> 02:12:02,866
"investigate this. Currently we're holding no one
at immediate prison sentence for this, but--"

1589
02:12:02,866 --> 02:12:07,188
LIAM: You realize your lord would not be alive now
were it not for us, don't you?

1590
02:12:07,188 --> 02:12:15,776
MARISHA: Also, you're a common guard. I'm speaking
because Tiberius would say this, and he's not here

1591
02:12:15,776 --> 02:12:23,862
right now because he's a little stupid at the
moment, but do not interfere with the businesses

1592
02:12:23,862 --> 02:12:30,719
that we have already arranged with people who have
higher authority than you. Back off.

1593
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:32,206
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1594
02:12:32,206 --> 02:12:36,486
MARISHA: Oh, I'm not good at this shit. I'm going
to train in it. It's coming.

1595
02:12:36,486 --> 02:12:38,844
MATT: You do get a d6 inspiration dice.

1596
02:12:38,844 --> 02:12:41,180
MARISHA: I also still have Scanlan's.

1597
02:12:41,302 --> 02:12:43,604
MATT: Well, if you
already have Scanlan's, then that's all you need.

1598
02:12:43,604 --> 02:12:45,452
TRAVIS: And I walk over and stand behind her.

1599
02:12:45,452 --> 02:12:50,039
MARISHA: I'm going to add my Scanlan. 15.

1600
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:56,142
MATT: All right. The guard looks at you for a
second, then steps away. "I mean no offense,

1601
02:12:56,142 --> 02:12:57,234
"understand we've had--"

1602
02:12:57,234 --> 02:12:59,486
LAURA: What's up? What's good?

1603
02:12:59,486 --> 02:13:09,474
MATT: He relinquishes the hand on the side of the
tiefling and says, "We're going to investigate

1604
02:13:09,474 --> 02:13:16,542
"this. I mean no disrespect to you. You've been
much aid to Emon. Just understand, this is a very

1605
02:13:16,542 --> 02:13:26,075
"peculiar circumstance. Please, we'll call you when
it's time to get your opinions and your

1606
02:13:26,075 --> 02:13:27,730
"perspectives on the evening's events."

1607
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:29,841
MARISHA: No, we'll call you.

1608
02:13:29,841 --> 02:13:38,461
MATT: "We need to go ahead and notify--" at this
point you can see now, Tiberius, you've stepped up

1609
02:13:38,461 --> 02:13:44,367
in front of the stairs as Allura comes rushing out
to inspect everything and sees you.

1610
02:13:44,367 --> 02:13:48,939
ORION: (groaning, fumbling) And I go to Lockheed,
and I use my telepathic bond that I have with my

1611
02:13:48,939 --> 02:13:59,448
pet. And I convey to him, to tell her, I emote to
him, with my telepathic link with him, and I

1612
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:06,563
(foreign words).

1613
02:14:06,563 --> 02:14:08,761
MATT: You can't even form language thoughts.

1614
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:09,984
ORION: That's what I emote to him.

1615
02:14:09,984 --> 02:14:13,949
MATT: You can give him an emotion. That's the most
you can get to him right now

1616
02:14:13,949 --> 02:14:16,898
ORION: Right, and I try to have him telepathically
tell her.

1617
02:14:16,898 --> 02:14:18,375
MATT: Tell her what emotion?

1618
02:14:18,375 --> 02:14:20,016
ORION: Help.

1619
02:14:20,016 --> 02:14:21,329
MATT: Okay.

1620
02:14:21,329 --> 02:14:23,908
ORION: I do this.

1621
02:14:23,908 --> 02:14:26,683
MATT: She steps forward and says, "Tiberius--"

1622
02:14:26,683 --> 02:14:28,688
MARISHA: The universal symbol for I'm choking.

1623
02:14:28,688 --> 02:14:31,413
ORION: (frustrated noises)

1624
02:14:31,413 --> 02:14:36,504
MATT: And you just breathe flame out and Allura
steps back for a second, "Tiberius, are you all

1625
02:14:36,504 --> 02:14:42,350
"right? You've been cursed by something. Hold on."
She takes your head and holds you in place to calm

1626
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:48,917
you down. "Tiberius, calm yourself." And begins to
inspect you, running her fingers up the side of

1627
02:14:48,917 --> 02:14:54,415
your snout and like, "This is not good, this is
very powerful magic. I don't know if I have

1628
02:14:54,415 --> 02:15:01,521
"capability of doing this really, you need a
cleric. Please, sit tight, stay right here." The

1629
02:15:01,521 --> 02:15:07,933
rest of you, as the guards back away, you're left
alone and the rest of the group are looking upon

1630
02:15:07,933 --> 02:15:09,338
you in a curious way.

1631
02:15:09,338 --> 02:15:11,299
LAURA: Vampires!

1632
02:15:11,299 --> 02:15:12,616
SAM: And a tiefling.

1633
02:15:12,616 --> 02:15:17,232
TALIESIN: I want to inspect the carriage to see if
there's anything interesting about the carriage.

1634
02:15:17,232 --> 02:15:20,116
LAURA: Are you hurt? Did they do anything to you?
You were unconscious.

1635
02:15:20,116 --> 02:15:23,268
LIAM: They bit me.

1636
02:15:23,268 --> 02:15:25,029
LAURA: I search him and look for any mark.

1637
02:15:25,029 --> 02:15:28,350
LIAM: I don't feel right. I think I need to go to
a temple.

1638
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:29,969
MARISHA: Can I do a health check on him?

1639
02:15:29,969 --> 02:15:34,212
MATT: You can make a medicine check, sure. Percy,
go ahead and roll an investigation check

1640
02:15:34,212 --> 02:15:36,758
LIAM: I think I'm dangerous.

1641
02:15:36,758 --> 02:15:38,633
MARISHA: 18.

1642
02:15:38,633 --> 02:15:41,483
MATT: Okay, yeah, there are definitely two
puncture wounds on the side of his neck

1643
02:15:41,483 --> 02:15:44,919
LIAM: You need to put me in the dungeon very
soon.

1644
02:15:44,919 --> 02:15:50,393
SAM: I've read about this. We bury him under the
ground for five days and five nights, all will be

1645
02:15:50,393 --> 02:15:51,328
better.

1646
02:15:51,328 --> 02:15:52,448
ORION: That's kimchi.

1647
02:15:52,448 --> 02:15:55,887
SAM: Well, it could be. Could be kimchi. Either
way, it will be very tasty.

1648
02:15:55,887 --> 02:15:58,226
TALIESIN: Eight.

1649
02:15:58,226 --> 02:16:02,293
MATT: Most everything that would be of interest
has been destroyed in the sheer force of the

1650
02:16:02,293 --> 02:16:05,677
explosion. The carriage is in tatters. There's not
much you can really glean from it, unfortunately.

1651
02:16:05,677 --> 02:16:07,532
MARISHA: What time of day is it?

1652
02:16:07,532 --> 02:16:12,522
MATT: Time of night. Right now, it's probably
cresting close to 10:00 or 11:00PM.

1653
02:16:12,522 --> 02:16:18,518
MARISHA: Would the Sarenrae temple still be open?
It's a church. They're 24 hours, right?

1654
02:16:18,518 --> 02:16:24,794
MATT: I mean, (laughs) the temple is always there,
per se. I mean, there are multiple temples in the

1655
02:16:24,794 --> 02:16:27,014
city as well. The Sarenrae temple is the one you
know best.

1656
02:16:27,014 --> 02:16:30,620
LAURA: I turn and look. You.

1657
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:32,132
SAM: What's your name?

1658
02:16:32,132 --> 02:16:33,303
LAURA: You helped us.

1659
02:16:33,303 --> 02:16:36,099
SAM: Your real name.

1660
02:16:36,099 --> 02:16:43,484
KIT: You have interesting taste in enemies, almost
as interesting as mine. My name is Lillith.

1661
02:16:43,484 --> 02:16:46,366
MARISHA: Lillith? That's so pretty.

1662
02:16:46,366 --> 02:16:50,315
KIT: Thank you, as are you also, might I add.

1663
02:16:50,315 --> 02:16:54,066
LAURA: Interesting taste in enemies. Do you know
anything about vampires?

1664
02:16:54,066 --> 02:17:07,401
KIT: Regrettably, not as much as I would like. But
your brother? He does look, not as healthy as I

1665
02:17:07,401 --> 02:17:09,939
imagine he may usually.

1666
02:17:09,939 --> 02:17:11,853
SAM: Are you a healer of some sort?

1667
02:17:11,853 --> 02:17:13,061
KIT: I am not.

1668
02:17:13,061 --> 02:17:15,284
TRAVIS: Oh, what do you deal in?

1669
02:17:15,284 --> 02:17:24,630
SAM: And why did you in<i>fil</i>trate the castle? That's
how the British people say it

1670
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:29,031
KIT: Oh, really? Well.

1671
02:17:29,031 --> 02:17:30,747
SAM: Aluminium.

1672
02:17:30,747 --> 02:17:33,814
LAURA: Laboratory.

1673
02:17:33,814 --> 02:17:35,588
ORION: Astronaut.

1674
02:17:35,588 --> 02:17:38,216
MARISHA: Let's just keep listing words, guys.

1675
02:17:38,216 --> 02:17:39,342
KIT: Lift.

1676
02:17:39,342 --> 02:17:41,282
MARISHA: Lift!

1677
02:17:41,282 --> 02:17:49,558
KIT: I think you have currently more pressing
matters than my concerns, my presence here in the

1678
02:17:49,558 --> 02:17:50,637
castle.

1679
02:17:50,637 --> 02:17:54,095
LAURA: Then you'll come with us?

1680
02:17:54,095 --> 02:17:56,986
KIT: If that is what you wish.

1681
02:17:56,986 --> 02:17:58,183
LAURA: Yes.

1682
02:17:58,183 --> 02:18:01,911
MARISHA: Where are you from? Your accent's so--

1683
02:18:01,911 --> 02:18:07,487
LAURA: It's wonderfully interesting Keyleth, but
we need to get my brother to a cleric.

1684
02:18:07,487 --> 02:18:08,897
MARISHA: Oh, right, yeah.

1685
02:18:08,897 --> 02:18:12,414
MATT: At this point, as you guys are discussing,
and you're already nervous that you're out in the

1686
02:18:12,414 --> 02:18:22,299
open anyway. You're not under one of your various
guises. You feel this warm bolt of heat in your

1687
02:18:22,299 --> 02:18:27,755
upper torso area. And you guys watch as suddenly
across the front of her chest, this strange,

1688
02:18:27,755 --> 02:18:33,607
glowing, red eye-like sigil (flame noises)
emblazons across the front and then slowly fades.

1689
02:18:33,607 --> 02:18:37,852
SAM: I am just looking at the symbol, I am not
looking at anything else.

1690
02:18:37,852 --> 02:18:40,799
LAURA: What was that?

1691
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:53,068
MARISHA: Are you all right? Are you with the
Briarwoods?

1692
02:18:53,068 --> 02:19:06,369
KIT: No, but I must leave. I must leave this place
right now. Immediately. I drop a shroud of

1693
02:19:06,369 --> 02:19:09,515
illusion over myself again, become the
maidservant.

1694
02:19:09,515 --> 02:19:17,291
MATT: You guys watch her visual image shimmer back
into that of a servant. And even through the

1695
02:19:17,291 --> 02:19:21,937
illusion there is still this dull, pulsating red,
glowing arcane mark of an eye, that's slowly

1696
02:19:21,937 --> 02:19:23,825
shimmering on the front of her torso.

1697
02:19:23,825 --> 02:19:25,608
LAURA: Can you come with us to a temple?

1698
02:19:25,608 --> 02:19:30,936
KIT: For not long. I cannot linger.

1699
02:19:30,936 --> 02:19:34,986
SAM: What is that mark on you?

1700
02:19:34,986 --> 02:19:41,298
KIT: This is the mark of the Broker.

1701
02:19:41,298 --> 02:19:42,775
SAM: The Broker?

1702
02:19:42,775 --> 02:19:49,687
KIT: The Broker. He has been seeking me and I have
been hiding here, but no longer. He has found me.

1703
02:19:49,687 --> 02:19:55,185
This mark, it means that I cannot hide any longer.
I must leave.

1704
02:19:55,185 --> 02:19:58,226
SAM: You helped us in battle. Do you need us to
help hide you?

1705
02:19:58,226 --> 02:20:03,246
KIT: I would not drag you into my troubles. I know
who you are, you are Vox Machina.

1706
02:20:03,246 --> 02:20:07,170
LAURA: How did you know about us?

1707
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:09,323
KIT: Some of you traveled with my cousin Zahra.

1708
02:20:09,323 --> 02:20:11,028
(gasps)

1709
02:20:11,028 --> 02:20:13,950
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Zahra! She's so wonderful. I
love her so much!

1710
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:20,873
KIT: We are very close. She is a dear friend of
mine, but she told me of you. I know you

1711
02:20:20,873 --> 02:20:23,664
have your own troubles. I would not drag you into
mine.

1712
02:20:23,664 --> 02:20:29,328
MARISHA: Well look, we've got to make a pit stop
at the temple of Sarenrae, anyway. Why don't you

1713
02:20:29,328 --> 02:20:34,062
at least join us, and then we can at least go back
to Greyskull keep for dinner, because we also have

1714
02:20:34,062 --> 02:20:37,984
to drag this prisoner back there. It's along the
way.

1715
02:20:37,984 --> 02:20:44,028
LAURA: Yes. Any watcher that comes after you we'll
fight them. We're very strong right now and full

1716
02:20:44,028 --> 02:20:45,812
of health.

1717
02:20:45,812 --> 02:20:47,784
TRAVIS: And we protect things with tails.

1718
02:20:47,784 --> 02:20:55,313
MATT: A voice rings out suddenly from behind you
towards the palace. "All of you, stop your

1719
02:20:55,313 --> 02:21:01,000
"business." And you look and you see there in his
robes, Uriel, which you summoned, standing at the

1720
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,891
front of the palace. "Am I to understand there has
been a scuffle with my guests?"

1721
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:10,307
LAURA: Your guests are vampires. Look at my
brother right now.

1722
02:21:10,307 --> 02:21:12,693
MARISHA: And Tiberius is--

1723
02:21:12,693 --> 02:21:14,948
SAM: An idiot.

1724
02:21:14,948 --> 02:21:19,503
MARISHA: He's an idiot. I don't know where he's an
idiot right now. Damn it, we lost Tiberius.

1725
02:21:19,503 --> 02:21:21,304
SAM: He's even more of an idiot.

1726
02:21:21,304 --> 02:21:24,317
LIAM: (calling out) Tiberius!

1727
02:21:24,317 --> 02:21:26,966
MATT: You see now on the front steps sitting there
next to Allura, who's cradling him,

1728
02:21:26,966 --> 02:21:28,768
as he's unsure of what is happening.

1729
02:21:28,768 --> 02:21:29,839
LIAM: Oh, do we see them?

1730
02:21:29,839 --> 02:21:31,119
MATT: You do, yes.

1731
02:21:31,119 --> 02:21:33,815
LAURA: Look at his neck.

1732
02:21:33,815 --> 02:21:38,656
MATT: Uriel looks and says, "I'm certain there is
some sort of explanation for this."

1733
02:21:38,656 --> 02:21:41,382
LAURA: You invited vampires into your palace.

1734
02:21:41,382 --> 02:21:43,393
MARISHA: You invited them in.

1735
02:21:43,393 --> 02:21:50,199
MATT: "We will investigate. Look, the Briarwoods
are esteemed guests of ours, and friends. So this

1736
02:21:50,199 --> 02:21:51,887
"is going to be taken very seriously."

1737
02:21:51,887 --> 02:21:58,807
LIAM: You can have whatever mages you want cast
truth on me. I was bitten. This threat is real.

1738
02:21:58,807 --> 02:22:07,975
TALIESIN: The Briarwoods murdered the de Rolos and
took Whitestone. I have proof. I was there.

1739
02:22:07,975 --> 02:22:17,582
MATT: "Then we shall have to have a conversation.
For the time being, take care of this one.

1740
02:22:17,582 --> 02:22:22,569
"Tomorrow, when the sun rises, find yourself back
to the palace. I would very much like to speak

1741
02:22:22,569 --> 02:22:24,568
"with you. This disturbs me."

1742
02:22:24,568 --> 02:22:28,798
TALIESIN: I would recommend, Uriel, dis-inviting
them for now.

1743
02:22:28,798 --> 02:22:32,243
LIAM: We have earned your trust, have we not?

1744
02:22:32,243 --> 02:22:35,788
MATT: "You have. As have they."

1745
02:22:35,788 --> 02:22:45,993
KIT: If I may, my lord. I was present for-- please
excuse me addressing your grace, but I was present

1746
02:22:45,993 --> 02:22:55,859
for the battle, and I did see, oh! Quite a set of
teeth he had. Oh, dreadful pale. And oh, terrible.

1747
02:22:55,859 --> 02:23:02,538
Oh, flames everywhere and ripped dresses and
heaving bosoms. Oh my lord! It was awful!

1748
02:23:02,538 --> 02:23:05,833
MATT: "All right." Go ahead and make a persuasion
roll.

1749
02:23:05,833 --> 02:23:09,145
SAM: She's a common servant girl. She wouldn't
lie!

1750
02:23:09,145 --> 02:23:12,683
MARISHA: Yes. Look, she is traumatized.

1751
02:23:12,683 --> 02:23:16,326
KIT: 18?

1752
02:23:16,326 --> 02:23:20,926
MATT: "Very well, calm yourself, calm yourself."

1753
02:23:20,926 --> 02:23:23,231
LAURA: It's all right darling. It's all right.

1754
02:23:23,231 --> 02:23:24,927
KIT: Oh! It were awful!

1755
02:23:24,927 --> 02:23:27,862
SAM: We'll take care of her for now.

1756
02:23:27,862 --> 02:23:31,237
KIT: Oh, I'm getting the vapors! Oh no.

1757
02:23:31,237 --> 02:23:41,097
MATT: "Take care of her. We'll talk tomorrow.
Bring me what proof you have. This is a very, very

1758
02:23:41,097 --> 02:23:45,977
"serious thing you're discussing."

1759
02:23:45,977 --> 02:23:50,552
MARISHA: We'll talk to him in the morning. We got
to go.

1760
02:23:50,552 --> 02:23:52,124
MATT: You guys gather up--

1761
02:23:52,124 --> 02:23:57,782
MARISHA: I turn into a horse and pick up Vax and
Vex and take them to Sarenrae's temple.

1762
02:23:57,782 --> 02:24:00,587
MATT: Okay, you guys leap onto the back of Keyleth
as she rides off.

1763
02:24:00,587 --> 02:24:05,930
LAURA: I hold onto your mighty mane, and then him
as well.

1764
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:11,559
MATT: Allura takes Tiberius, takes you by the
elbow, and leads you over the rest of the group as

1765
02:24:11,559 --> 02:24:17,855
they ride off. "If you are, indeed, going to a
cleric, perhaps you should take Tiberius with you.

1766
02:24:17,855 --> 02:24:19,977
"He's not well."

1767
02:24:19,977 --> 02:24:30,858
SAM: He seems totally normal to me. Seems like
every day. Yep, that's pretty much basic him.

1768
02:24:30,858 --> 02:24:34,990
TRAVIS: Is Seeker Asum still around?

1769
02:24:34,990 --> 02:24:38,943
MATT: Seeker Asum currently is nowhere near this
situation.

1770
02:24:38,943 --> 02:24:41,207
ORION: I lick all of Vox Machina.

1771
02:24:41,207 --> 02:24:46,180
MATT: All that are present, because many are now
riding away on a horse. (laughs) But the rest of

1772
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:47,611
them get a fine licking.

1773
02:24:47,611 --> 02:24:48,979
TRAVIS: Oh jeez, no!

1774
02:24:48,979 --> 02:24:50,884
ORION: I lick Grog the most.

1775
02:24:50,884 --> 02:24:52,832
TRAVIS: Smells like flies.

1776
02:24:52,832 --> 02:24:56,551
MATT: You all manage to make you way up to the
temple of Sarenrae. The lantern light of the

1777
02:24:56,551 --> 02:25:02,415
interior of the temple's main structure is low, as
it is late in the evening. Nevertheless, the gates

1778
02:25:02,415 --> 02:25:10,273
are always open. And as you enter, you are greeted
by two clerics that are dressed in long, flowing

1779
02:25:10,273 --> 02:25:18,084
yellow and gold robes, and there is one elderly
cleric that you recall. The one that led the

1780
02:25:18,084 --> 02:25:23,987
resurrection ritual on Pike. Not but almost a year
ago actually.

1781
02:25:23,987 --> 02:25:26,932
LAURA: I hop down off of Keyleth.

1782
02:25:26,932 --> 02:25:28,678
(laughter)

1783
02:25:28,678 --> 02:25:34,461
LAURA: I take you down, as well. And I say,
please, please sir, I hope we're not disturbing

1784
02:25:34,461 --> 02:25:36,642
you, but we need your help again.

1785
02:25:36,642 --> 02:25:38,974
LIAM: I totally eat it and just hit the ground.

1786
02:25:38,974 --> 02:25:40,979
TRAVIS: That wasn't my fault.

1787
02:25:40,979 --> 02:25:46,274
MATT: The two younger clerics step away as the
older one steps forward. He's balding on top, this

1788
02:25:46,274 --> 02:25:48,821
long straggly white gray hair that crests--

1789
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:51,311
ORION: I go up to him and start sniffing him.
(sniffing noises)

1790
02:25:51,311 --> 02:25:57,912
MARISHA: He used to be a very intelligent
sorcerer. This is part of the problem.

1791
02:25:57,912 --> 02:26:05,980
MATT: "There does appear to be arcane residue on
this one. Yes, we could hope to cleanse him of

1792
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:16,460
"this. Come, enter. Light the lanterns." And the
clerics all start turning up various lanterns, and

1793
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:23,152
the magical light source of it as soon as you
enter the temple. A cold ripple sensation begins

1794
02:26:23,152 --> 02:26:28,026
to curl on the back of your neck as you step in.
As you do step in, too, the two clerics give you a

1795
02:26:28,026 --> 02:26:33,313
look, and are uncomfortable with the presence. And
as it has, you guys, through your travels, you

1796
02:26:33,313 --> 02:26:36,972
have encountered very few tieflings, let
alone on this continent. In fact, most you have

1797
02:26:36,972 --> 02:26:41,599
met were in Vasselheim. This one in Emon stands
out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be

1798
02:26:41,599 --> 02:26:43,402
just a little put off by her presence.

1799
02:26:43,402 --> 02:26:44,986
LAURA: I thought she was disguised.

1800
02:26:44,986 --> 02:26:47,823
MATT: That's right. Never mind, I retract that
entire sequence.

1801
02:26:47,823 --> 02:26:49,255
KIT: He's still looking nervous.

1802
02:26:49,255 --> 02:26:52,568
MATT: As she comes out of this feverish daydream,
none of that happened.

1803
02:26:52,568 --> 02:26:54,477
(laughter)

1804
02:26:54,477 --> 02:26:57,009
LIAM: I'm so glad that didn't happen.

1805
02:26:57,009 --> 02:27:07,820
MATT: Illusions. All right, so. As you guys enter
the center of the chamber. He begins burning

1806
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:19,260
various incenses. As you step up, the cleric says,
"Understand, these services are intensive in the

1807
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:21,801
"costs required to present them to you."

1808
02:27:21,801 --> 02:27:23,324
LAURA: We'll pay whatever cost you need.

1809
02:27:23,324 --> 02:27:24,968
SAM: No, we should haggle, don't you think?

1810
02:27:24,968 --> 02:27:26,216
LAURA: No.

1811
02:27:26,216 --> 02:27:27,966
ORION: I lick the cleric.

1812
02:27:27,966 --> 02:27:31,601
MATT: (chuckles) The cleric: "Oh no, that--
that's, that's very--"

1813
02:27:31,601 --> 02:27:35,286
SAM: How much will it take to save our friends?

1814
02:27:35,286 --> 02:27:37,054
LAURA: Sir, anything.

1815
02:27:37,054 --> 02:27:43,325
MATT: He says: "For this one, we require a
donation to the temple of Sarenrae of a hundred

1816
02:27:43,325 --> 02:27:44,498
"gold pieces."

1817
02:27:44,498 --> 02:27:45,630
LAURA: Oh, done.

1818
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:50,051
MATT: He steps forward, and touches the side of
your head on your temple and begins to focus. The

1819
02:27:50,051 --> 02:27:54,449
symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow on the front of
his clavicle. And suddenly, you can see these

1820
02:27:54,449 --> 02:28:01,577
strange, gray veins that had wrapped around the
sides of Tiberius's head retract, dissipate then

1821
02:28:01,577 --> 02:28:06,935
fade, as intelligence swells back into your brain.
And for the first time in at least the past half

1822
02:28:06,935 --> 02:28:11,813
an hour or so, you are back to being Tiberius
Stormwind.

1823
02:28:11,813 --> 02:28:13,787
ORION: (licking sounds)

1824
02:28:13,787 --> 02:28:15,223
SAM: Well, that's uncalled for.

1825
02:28:15,223 --> 02:28:17,371
MARISHA: Could there be side effects or
something?

1826
02:28:17,371 --> 02:28:22,056
ORION: No, I just wanted to really do that. That
was really inconvenient. Let's help Vax.

1827
02:28:22,056 --> 02:28:24,425
SAM: Oh. You're with us again.

1828
02:28:24,425 --> 02:28:25,538
ORION: Yes.

1829
02:28:25,538 --> 02:28:29,800
SAM: Oh, well, welcome back. How was it, being
dumb?

1830
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:36,812
ORION: I was quite frightened, most of the time. I
didn't know what was going on. I couldn't cast

1831
02:28:36,812 --> 02:28:39,817
spells and I was-- Let's help Vax.

1832
02:28:39,817 --> 02:28:43,295
LIAM: You didn't shit yourself, so you're a
winner.

1833
02:28:43,295 --> 02:28:49,393
ORION: That's good, yes. You shit yourself, Vax? I
cast Prestidigitation on his butt.

1834
02:28:49,393 --> 02:28:51,203
LIAM: What the-- Oh.

1835
02:28:51,203 --> 02:28:53,398
LAURA: You're clean; don't worry.

1836
02:28:53,398 --> 02:29:00,586
MATT: Okay. As you bring Vax forward, the cleric
leans forward. "What is wrong with this one?"

1837
02:29:00,586 --> 02:29:04,139
LAURA: He was bitten by something quite unholy.

1838
02:29:04,139 --> 02:29:11,336
MATT: "Oh. The good news is, if you're standing
here, then most of the danger is gone. However,

1839
02:29:11,336 --> 02:29:17,474
"there might be some residual of the infection." He
leans forward and inspects it for a second,

1840
02:29:17,474 --> 02:29:21,574
reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs
and presses them into it. It burns a little bit.

1841
02:29:21,574 --> 02:29:24,892
MARISHA: Ooh, do I recognize what herbs he's
using?

1842
02:29:24,892 --> 02:29:26,212
MATT: Make a nature check.

1843
02:29:26,212 --> 02:29:27,230
MARISHA: Nature check?

1844
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:28,849
LIAM: Is it sticky?

1845
02:29:28,849 --> 02:29:32,711
MARISHA: 19, so 29.

1846
02:29:32,711 --> 02:29:40,273
MATT: This is glissfoil. Glissfoil is used by many
medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away

1847
02:29:40,273 --> 02:29:42,556
infections and cleansing wounds.

1848
02:29:42,556 --> 02:29:44,369
TALIESIN: He didn't even look down. He just said
it.

1849
02:29:44,369 --> 02:29:48,133
LIAM: Who didn't know that here, honestly.

1850
02:29:48,133 --> 02:29:53,710
MATT: As he presses in, he looks to you. "As long
as this doesn't get infected, it should be all

1851
02:29:53,710 --> 02:30:01,237
"right. I assume, based on what you say, the nature
of these wounds, that is some sort of--"

1852
02:30:01,362 --> 02:30:02,948
LAURA: They drank his blood.

1853
02:30:02,948 --> 02:30:04,281
MATT: "Vampirism."

1854
02:30:04,281 --> 02:30:05,352
LIAM: Yeah.

1855
02:30:05,352 --> 02:30:13,594
MATT: "From what I know of vampirism, it requires
many tastes of your life force and bringing you to

1856
02:30:13,594 --> 02:30:17,545
"the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn
you."

1857
02:30:17,545 --> 02:30:23,481
LIAM: Listen, doc, I can't bite anybody here. Are
you sure?

1858
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:30,581
MATT: "Unless this is some unnatural thing beyond
classic vampirism, you should be fine."

1859
02:30:30,581 --> 02:30:33,471
LIAM: What do you mean, unnatural?

1860
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:36,186
LAURA: Well, any vampirism is a little unnatural.

1861
02:30:36,186 --> 02:30:45,427
MARISHA: Excuse me? Do you actually have any extra
of that glissfoil or any seeds that I could take

1862
02:30:45,427 --> 02:30:50,727
with me? That way I can just keep up on his daily
disinfection.

1863
02:30:50,727 --> 02:30:54,998
MATT: "Certainly." He reaches into a pouch and
pulls out a handful of glissfoil. It's like a

1864
02:30:54,998 --> 02:30:59,590
dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a
little bit and gives it to you.

1865
02:30:59,590 --> 02:31:01,062
MARISHA: Thank you so much.

1866
02:31:01,062 --> 02:31:06,949
ORION: As it happens, I reach for my decanter and
I can control the charge; it's just charged, but I

1867
02:31:06,949 --> 02:31:12,925
dissipate the charge. But also keep it for a
little bit? No, I dissipate the whole thing. And I

1868
02:31:12,925 --> 02:31:20,561
turn to the cleric and I go, oh holy man which
cured my mind, would you be so graceful as to use

1869
02:31:20,561 --> 02:31:25,015
the force of Sarenrae to bless the water in my
canteen?

1870
02:31:25,015 --> 02:31:26,367
SAM: To what the water?

1871
02:31:26,367 --> 02:31:31,767
ORION: To bless it. I'm going to hold it up above
my head way too dramatically.

1872
02:31:31,767 --> 02:31:38,489
MATT: "There are rituals, but they take some time.
If you'd like to leave it here, we could make use of

1873
02:31:38,489 --> 02:31:41,833
"this and bless the contents of it, yes."

1874
02:31:41,833 --> 02:31:45,658
ORION: No, I thought you could like do a 
Hosannah and get me out of here.

1875
02:31:45,658 --> 02:31:55,123
MATT: "Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
But should you require such blessing, we would be

1876
02:31:55,123 --> 02:31:56,662
"happy to oblige."

1877
02:31:56,662 --> 02:32:00,886
ORION: Wonderful! How many days, give or take, do
you think it might take to accomplish?

1878
02:32:00,886 --> 02:32:04,436
MATT: "For that amount there? Two days."

1879
02:32:04,436 --> 02:32:07,571
ORION: Oh wonderful! We'll be here for two days,
guys?

1880
02:32:07,571 --> 02:32:08,723
LIAM: Probably will.

1881
02:32:08,723 --> 02:32:11,054
ORION: I'll leave it with you.

1882
02:32:11,054 --> 02:32:16,603
MATT: "For this volume--" He looks at it for a
second and says,

1883
02:32:16,603 --> 02:32:20,712
"This is an enchanted vial, is it not?"

1884
02:32:20,712 --> 02:32:22,979
ORION: Yes! Good eye!

1885
02:32:22,979 --> 02:32:31,401
MATT: "I'm curious to see how this will interact
with the enchantment. We'll try. We'll put it at a

1886
02:32:31,401 --> 02:32:34,834
"25 gold donation for the two days of
enchantment."

1887
02:32:34,834 --> 02:32:36,684
ORION: I give you 50.

1888
02:32:36,684 --> 02:32:38,340
MATT: "Thank you."

1889
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:42,130
ORION: Thank you for your service. The other 25 is
for my brain.

1890
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:47,498
MATT: "Well, is there anything else I can do to
help you this evening?"

1891
02:32:47,498 --> 02:32:54,089
SAM: Thank you for all your assistance. Did he
tell us a price for fixing Vax?

1892
02:32:54,089 --> 02:32:59,250
MATT: "That was a simple disinfection. There's no
price for that. We're happy to heal here."

1893
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:03,256
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1894
02:33:03,256 --> 02:33:06,704
SAM: Our friend Pike would be much, much grateful
for your service.

1895
02:33:06,704 --> 02:33:08,090
MATT: "Pike Trickfoot?"

1896
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:09,887
MARISHA: Yes, do you remember her?

1897
02:33:09,887 --> 02:33:13,642
LAURA: She's in Vasselheim, restoring another
temple of Sarenrae at this moment.

1898
02:33:13,827 --> 02:33:15,469
LIAM: Spreading the good word.

1899
02:33:15,469 --> 02:33:23,987
MATT: This deep smile brings his face from this
deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you

1900
02:33:23,987 --> 02:33:31,916
hadn't seen before, and he goes, "I had not known
that our lady had reach as far as Vasselheim."

1901
02:33:31,916 --> 02:33:33,700
(offscreen thud)

1902
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:35,095
LIAM: Oh dear.

1903
02:33:35,095 --> 02:33:36,822
MATT: "It appears you've messed yourself."

1904
02:33:36,822 --> 02:33:41,877
LIAM: Sorry! Is that blessed holy water? I'm
sorry. I'll pay for that.

1905
02:33:41,877 --> 02:33:51,403
MATT: "I'm happy to hear that she has continued
carrying her faith to distant lands, and that she

1906
02:33:51,403 --> 02:33:54,593
"has recovered well since our last meeting."

1907
02:33:54,593 --> 02:33:55,646
LAURA: She has.

1908
02:33:55,646 --> 02:33:57,241
LIAM: She's thriving.

1909
02:33:57,241 --> 02:33:58,655
MATT: "Good."

1910
02:33:58,655 --> 02:34:07,988
SAM: And one more thing before we leave. If you
need any items, be they gear or blades, go to

1911
02:34:07,988 --> 02:34:12,131
Gilmore's! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Today!

1912
02:34:12,131 --> 02:34:13,808
ORION: You don't have to sell it--

1913
02:34:13,808 --> 02:34:16,453
SAM: We're supposed to plug him, right? I don't
know.

1914
02:34:16,453 --> 02:34:18,196
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1915
02:34:18,196 --> 02:34:23,791
LIAM: That was a little ham-fisted, but he does
speak the truth. Gilmore makes a quality item.

1916
02:34:23,791 --> 02:34:25,650
SAM: 25.

1917
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:28,007
LIAM: That was very awkward, Scanlan, but it's
true.

1918
02:34:28,007 --> 02:34:33,216
MATT: He goes "Gilmore? I think I've seen that
shop around."

1919
02:34:33,216 --> 02:34:39,294
LAURA: They're opening a shop in here-- just
kidding. There's a shop here!

1920
02:34:39,294 --> 02:34:40,977
SAM: There is a shop here!

1921
02:34:40,977 --> 02:34:45,874
MATT: "Me and the clerics might have to go see it,
then."

1922
02:34:45,874 --> 02:34:47,715
MARISHA: Tell them Vox Machina sent you!

1923
02:34:47,715 --> 02:34:49,349
SAM: And you get ten percent off.

1924
02:34:49,349 --> 02:34:55,329
LIAM: If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get
15.

1925
02:34:55,329 --> 02:35:02,694
MATT: "Good to know. Appreciate that.
Nevertheless, sleep calls to me. I must get back to--"

1926
02:35:02,694 --> 02:35:04,183
LAURA: Sleep calls to us as well, sir.

1927
02:35:04,183 --> 02:35:05,756
MATT: "Well, good night and adieu to you all."

1928
02:35:05,756 --> 02:35:07,063
LAURA: Thank you for opening your doors.

1929
02:35:07,063 --> 02:35:10,389
SAM: Hey, oh, what was your name? For the next
time we have a dead ally.

1930
02:35:10,389 --> 02:35:18,808
LIAM: (laughs) Oh, tomorrow, you mean?

1931
02:35:18,808 --> 02:35:20,216
MATT: "Tristan."

1932
02:35:20,216 --> 02:35:22,645
SAM: Cleric Tristan? Thank you, Cleric Tristan.

1933
02:35:22,645 --> 02:35:24,619
MATT: "Of course."

1934
02:35:24,619 --> 02:35:26,373
SAM: Blessed be Sarenrae's name.

1935
02:35:26,373 --> 02:35:32,811
ORION: And I awkwardly bow out and say: See you in
two days, oh mighty brain fixer.

1936
02:35:32,811 --> 02:35:40,170
MATT: He steps back. The lights dim on the inside
of the temple as you exit. You guys step out into

1937
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:44,431
the cold night air on the streets of Emon.

1938
02:35:44,431 --> 02:35:48,482
LIAM: (yelling) I'm alive!

1939
02:35:48,482 --> 02:35:52,724
LAURA: That's loud. That hurt.

1940
02:35:52,724 --> 02:35:54,481
TRAVIS: Sorry, headphones.

1941
02:35:54,481 --> 02:35:59,899
LIAM: I am sorry to everyone watching at home for
blowing out the mic, but gods damn it, I'm alive.

1942
02:35:59,899 --> 02:36:01,836
SAM: That was close.

1943
02:36:01,836 --> 02:36:09,915
MARISHA: Yeah, actually, while we walk back to
Greyskull, what happened?

1944
02:36:09,915 --> 02:36:23,581
LIAM: I thought that I could get a peeky-poo at
what they actually were, who they were, and let's

1945
02:36:23,581 --> 02:36:33,607
face it, I fucked up is what I did. And Grog? You
may shave off my pubic region, or draw a dick on

1946
02:36:33,607 --> 02:36:41,757
my head, if you want, tomorrow. Vex'ahlia, I'm
sorry for not staying close by.

1947
02:36:41,757 --> 02:36:44,920
Scanlan, we're good.

1948
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:47,549
SAM: I saved your life.

1949
02:36:47,549 --> 02:36:55,820
LIAM: Tiberius, you are smart and I am very
stupid. You are extremely handsome and I am ugly.

1950
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:57,596
ORION: I don't disagree with any of that.

1951
02:36:57,596 --> 02:37:01,501
MARISHA: It would have been true 30 minutes ago.

1952
02:37:01,501 --> 02:37:16,017
LIAM: And I'm sorry. And Percy, I'm especially
sorry. To you most of all. We weren't ready, you

1953
02:37:16,017 --> 02:37:17,081
weren't ready.

1954
02:37:17,081 --> 02:37:23,853
TALIESIN: We haven't failed. It's not over yet.
I'm not done.

1955
02:37:23,853 --> 02:37:25,467
LAURA: We'll hunt them down.

1956
02:37:25,467 --> 02:37:27,918
MARISHA: They said your family was still there.

1957
02:37:27,918 --> 02:37:33,786
TALIESIN: They're liars. My family is dead.

1958
02:37:33,786 --> 02:37:37,354
SAM: We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll
kill them, and seek revenge.

1959
02:37:37,354 --> 02:37:39,276
ORION: And then we'll loot their bodies.

1960
02:37:39,276 --> 02:37:41,178
TALIESIN: I don't think we'll have to.

1961
02:37:41,178 --> 02:37:42,886
SAM: You don't think we'll have to?

1962
02:37:42,886 --> 02:37:44,641
TALIESIN: I think they're going to find us.

1963
02:37:44,641 --> 02:37:50,847
SAM: They won't attack us! We're many, and they're
few.

1964
02:37:50,847 --> 02:37:52,365
TRAVIS: That we know of.

1965
02:37:52,365 --> 02:37:54,253
ORION: Just because we're in a keep does not mean
we are safe.

1966
02:37:54,253 --> 02:37:55,926
LAURA: We need to set alarms around our keep.

1967
02:37:55,926 --> 02:38:00,372
SAM: We also need to protect our new friend,
Lillith fair, over here.

1968
02:38:00,372 --> 02:38:03,583
LIAM: Is that your last name?

1969
02:38:03,583 --> 02:38:08,268
SAM: Well, she's white, so I thought maybe--

1970
02:38:08,268 --> 02:38:10,462
KIT: My family name is Daturai.

1971
02:38:10,462 --> 02:38:13,854
MARISHA: How do you spell that?

1972
02:38:13,854 --> 02:38:22,941
KIT: (chuckles) In your tongue? D-A-T-U-R-A-I.

1973
02:38:22,941 --> 02:38:26,337
LIAM: I lost track after the D.

1974
02:38:26,337 --> 02:38:30,476
KIT: You have had a rough evening, it's
understandable.

1975
02:38:30,476 --> 02:38:35,343
LAURA: I hope you've learned your lesson.

1976
02:38:35,343 --> 02:38:38,005
LIAM: It'll be two weeks, at least, before I do
anything--

1977
02:38:38,005 --> 02:38:40,167
LAURA: Quite so stupid and reckless--

1978
02:38:40,167 --> 02:38:44,170
MARISHA: We had a code word.

1979
02:38:44,170 --> 02:38:45,701
ORION: We had Jumanji!

1980
02:38:45,701 --> 02:38:46,604
LAURA: Jenga.

1981
02:38:46,604 --> 02:38:48,508
ORION: Oh, sorry. Damn it!

1982
02:38:48,508 --> 02:38:50,038
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

1983
02:38:50,038 --> 02:38:56,501
MATT: You look back at this point and you see, as
you guys are reaching the outer wall of Emon,

1984
02:38:56,501 --> 02:39:04,401
(galloping noise) behind you. (happy bear noises)
Rubs up against you. (moans)

1985
02:39:04,401 --> 02:39:10,094
LAURA: Your uncle almost died! I almost died. Did
you know I almost died, darling?

1986
02:39:10,094 --> 02:39:12,071
MATT: Licks the side of your face.

1987
02:39:12,071 --> 02:39:17,011
LIAM: I lean in, and I lick his nose with my own
tongue. And then I let him lick me

1988
02:39:17,011 --> 02:39:18,401
all over the place.

1989
02:39:18,401 --> 02:39:20,525
MATT: (sloppy bear noises)

1990
02:39:20,525 --> 02:39:22,329
TALIESIN: Vax.

1991
02:39:22,329 --> 02:39:23,908
LIAM: Yeah?

1992
02:39:23,908 --> 02:39:32,316
TALIESIN: Thank you. Thank you for your risk. Yes,
you were foolish, but thank you.

1993
02:39:32,316 --> 02:39:38,638
TRAVIS: I walk up to Vax and I extend my hand, and
I say, I'm glad you didn't die.

1994
02:39:38,638 --> 02:39:48,687
LIAM: I love you, Grog. Would you like to draw
balls on my forehead?

1995
02:39:48,687 --> 02:39:51,522
TRAVIS: And I reach back, and I backhand him as
hard as I can.

1996
02:39:51,522 --> 02:39:54,724
(laughter)

1997
02:39:54,724 --> 02:39:56,116
MATT: Roll an attack.

1998
02:39:56,116 --> 02:39:58,874
LIAM: I don't move at all. I just take it.

1999
02:39:58,874 --> 02:40:00,011
TRAVIS: 22.

2000
02:40:00,011 --> 02:40:03,326
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d4, divided by two.

2001
02:40:03,326 --> 02:40:04,548
LAURA: That's a six.

2002
02:40:04,548 --> 02:40:06,320
TRAVIS: No, it's two.

2003
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:10,949
MATT: Two plus your strength modifier, which I
believe is four. So you take six points of

2004
02:40:10,949 --> 02:40:16,265
backhand, bludgeoning damage as Grog (whacking).
The echo from the impact.

2005
02:40:16,265 --> 02:40:20,497
TRAVIS: And I say, no one kills you but me.

2006
02:40:20,497 --> 02:40:24,761
LAURA: You deserved that.

2007
02:40:24,761 --> 02:40:26,683
LIAM: Yeah.

2008
02:40:26,683 --> 02:40:28,637
ORION: Let's all get some rest, shall we?

2009
02:40:28,637 --> 02:40:34,594
SAM: Yes, but we'll have to prepare ourselves for
an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them?

2010
02:40:34,594 --> 02:40:37,961
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to find out in a
minute.

2011
02:40:37,961 --> 02:40:39,399
MARISHA: And don't we have a prisoner?

2012
02:40:39,399 --> 02:40:40,684
LAURA: Yes.

2013
02:40:40,684 --> 02:40:42,233
SAM: And we have a guest.

2014
02:40:42,233 --> 02:40:48,638
MARISHA: Yes, and we still haven't found what the
Broker-- who he is, or what he is.

2015
02:40:48,638 --> 02:40:51,968
SAM: Do you need to run from the Broker, or can
you stay with us for a few days?

2016
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:54,621
ORION: Do you owe some money? I don't understand.

2017
02:40:54,621 --> 02:40:59,639
KIT: How well guarded against scrying is your
keep?

2018
02:40:59,639 --> 02:41:01,001
SAM: Not at all.

2019
02:41:01,001 --> 02:41:03,702
LIAM: What about your room, Tiberius?

2020
02:41:03,702 --> 02:41:05,046
ORION: Yes.

2021
02:41:05,046 --> 02:41:07,638
LAURA: You're guarded against scrying in your
room?

2022
02:41:07,638 --> 02:41:12,112
ORION: Guards against scrying? Yes, of course!

2023
02:41:12,112 --> 02:41:13,774
SAM: Is that true?

2024
02:41:13,774 --> 02:41:15,546
LAURA: Against scrying.

2025
02:41:15,546 --> 02:41:19,440
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure we would have to have an
enchantment on our keep that would guard against

2026
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:20,478
scrying.

2027
02:41:20,478 --> 02:41:24,652
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, a
voice rings out behind you and says, "Don't worry.

2028
02:41:24,652 --> 02:41:27,666
"It's not going to help you."

2029
02:41:27,666 --> 02:41:31,775
TRAVIS: Is that little shitty Mr. Missing One
Hand?

2030
02:41:31,775 --> 02:41:38,736
MATT: No. You turn around and look, and you can
see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away

2031
02:41:38,736 --> 02:41:46,790
from you. You see dark brown and black studded
leather armor with a cloak over one shoulder.

2032
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:55,796
Standing straight, with a grin. Deep dark red
skin, burning yellow eyes and jet black, slicked

2033
02:41:55,796 --> 02:42:03,079
hair between two horns that jut back. A tiefling
stands there, looking forward, with two

2034
02:42:03,079 --> 02:42:06,019
individuals flanking from side to side that are
slowly stepping--

2035
02:42:06,019 --> 02:42:11,667
ORION: I don't know what they do, but I'm raising
my arm up. Who goes there? Who are you? I've had a

2036
02:42:11,667 --> 02:42:13,032
really bad day.

2037
02:42:13,032 --> 02:42:22,858
MATT: The tiefling, the male tiefling, steps up
forward and says, "I've no quarrel with any of

2038
02:42:22,858 --> 02:42:30,263
"you. We've been scouring this city for a fugitive
for a number of weeks. And as luck would have it,

2039
02:42:30,263 --> 02:42:33,725
"you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole."

2040
02:42:33,725 --> 02:42:37,430
MARISHA: I go ahead and crack my staff on the
ground and cast Anti-life Shell.

2041
02:42:37,430 --> 02:42:39,240
MATT: Okay.

2042
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:42,140
LIAM: And are they at the door?

2043
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:46,797
MATT: You guys are walking from the outside of the
wall to your keep.

2044
02:42:46,797 --> 02:42:48,250
LIAM: Where are they?

2045
02:42:48,250 --> 02:42:52,961
MATT: Right now? They are coming from Emon. You
guys are in this in-between section between your keep--

2046
02:42:52,961 --> 02:42:54,568
LIAM: We're outdoors? We've left the temple?

2047
02:42:54,568 --> 02:42:59,422
MATT: You are, yes. And we're going to go ahead
and have you guys roll initiative.

2048
02:42:59,422 --> 02:43:00,717
MARISHA: Get close to me!

2049
02:43:00,717 --> 02:43:02,586
MATT: Keyleth started this.

2050
02:43:02,586 --> 02:43:06,965
MARISHA: Get close-- what? Did I? But that's a
spell I cast on myself.

2051
02:43:06,965 --> 02:43:12,379
MATT: Right. Casting spells, generally, for most
people is a bad idea.

2052
02:43:12,379 --> 02:43:13,534
KIT: Natural 20!

2053
02:43:13,534 --> 02:43:15,714
(cheering)

2054
02:43:15,714 --> 02:43:19,186
MATT: All right, so from a visual perspective
here.

2055
02:43:19,186 --> 02:43:23,268
ORION: Yo, Stoneskin's up, dude. I didn't get to
say that shit.

2056
02:43:23,268 --> 02:43:30,184
MATT: Stoneskin's up on you, Anti-life Shell. Who
is where?

2057
02:43:30,184 --> 02:43:36,591
TRAVIS: Tibs and I are in the front, right?
Because we both took aggressive postures.

2058
02:43:36,591 --> 02:43:40,168
MARISHA: The closer to me you are, the more you'll
be guarded by the shell.

2059
02:43:40,168 --> 02:43:42,420
TRAVIS: Who said I want to be guarded?

2060
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:46,777
MARISHA: You can still fight around it. They just
can't get in.

2061
02:43:46,777 --> 02:43:50,898
MATT: All righty. Trinket is over this side here.

2062
02:43:50,898 --> 02:43:52,540
TALIESIN: And we have a prisoner.

2063
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:56,329
MATT: The prisoner was brought to your keep by the
guards.

2064
02:43:56,329 --> 02:44:00,546
TRAVIS: As close to the enemy as possible.
Tiberius and I took the aggressive stance.

2065
02:44:00,546 --> 02:44:02,725
MATT: Yes, you guys would be up that way. All
right.

2066
02:44:02,725 --> 02:44:09,947
LAURA: Oh no, why is there more than one person?

2067
02:44:09,947 --> 02:44:11,959
TRAVIS: He said two people are flanking him.

2068
02:44:11,959 --> 02:44:20,030
MATT: As you look at this point, you notice the
two individuals. To the left there is a

2069
02:44:20,169 --> 02:44:25,988
sickly-looking older woman with dark, verdant
clothing that flows and drags behind her. To the

2070
02:44:25,988 --> 02:44:31,222
right is a shirtless humanoid with darker, scarred
skin, very muscular, shirtless torso, wearing a

2071
02:44:31,222 --> 02:44:41,506
white, featureless mask over the face. And they
both curl to the sides. The initiative was...

2072
02:44:41,506 --> 02:44:50,433
What's the initiative order here? So who got 25 to
20? All righty. 20?

2073
02:44:50,433 --> 02:44:51,890
LAURA: 20.

2074
02:44:51,890 --> 02:44:53,433
KIT: 21.

2075
02:44:53,433 --> 02:44:57,841
ORION: And 20.

2076
02:44:57,841 --> 02:45:18,334
MATT: And 20 for you, as well? All right... Okay.
20 to 15?

2077
02:45:18,334 --> 02:45:20,218
SAM: 19.

2078
02:45:20,218 --> 02:45:24,491
MATT: 19, nice. Grog, what did you get?

2079
02:45:24,491 --> 02:45:25,699
TRAVIS: 18.

2080
02:45:25,699 --> 02:45:27,325
MATT: 18.

2081
02:45:27,325 --> 02:45:29,993
TRAVIS: My magic, man.

2082
02:45:29,993 --> 02:45:35,399
MATT: 15 to ten?

2083
02:45:35,399 --> 02:45:36,485
LIAM: 13.

2084
02:45:36,485 --> 02:45:37,566
MATT: 13.

2085
02:45:37,566 --> 02:45:39,218
MARISHA: 11.

2086
02:45:39,218 --> 02:45:46,141
MATT: All righty. Percy?

2087
02:45:46,141 --> 02:45:48,412
TALIESIN: 12.

2088
02:45:48,412 --> 02:45:52,164
MATT: What'd you say, Keyleth, you got 11?

2089
02:45:52,164 --> 02:45:54,510
MARISHA: 11. Bringing up the rears.

2090
02:45:54,510 --> 02:46:06,313
MATT: All right. Is that everybody? Cool. We're
good. So. As you (crash), how big is the radius of

2091
02:46:06,313 --> 02:46:07,713
the Anti-life Shell?

2092
02:46:07,713 --> 02:46:15,510
MARISHA: Anyone within ten feet of me. A decent
amount right now. Not Tiberius, not Scanlan.

2093
02:46:15,510 --> 02:46:16,980
LAURA: Not Trinket.

2094
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:19,674
MATT: Not technically Grog, because Grog would be
up front right there. So a ten-foot radius around

2095
02:46:19,674 --> 02:46:21,956
you. And what does it do, Anti-life Shell?

2096
02:46:21,956 --> 02:46:28,084
MARISHA: Nothing aside from undead and constructs
can get into it. You can still cast spells, and

2097
02:46:28,084 --> 02:46:35,072
fire bows, and you can still do stuff. We can go
out, they just can't get in.

2098
02:46:35,072 --> 02:46:36,842
LAURA: That's awesome.

2099
02:46:36,842 --> 02:46:44,590
MATT: The top of the round, the Broker goes.
Rolled a very high initiative. High dex

2100
02:46:44,590 --> 02:46:45,489
character.

2101
02:46:45,489 --> 02:46:46,709
TRAVIS: That is the Broker.

2102
02:46:46,709 --> 02:46:59,885
MATT: Yep. "Sweet Lillith, you've been a very bad
girl. Nefertiri, Nethspira, and Bellenore would

2103
02:46:59,885 --> 02:47:06,259
"all like to have a word with you. They've paid
quite a bit of sum, and proven legally: you need

2104
02:47:06,259 --> 02:47:12,994
"to be taken back. Now, to your friends here, it's
your choice: the easy way, or the hard way."

2105
02:47:12,994 --> 02:47:21,695
KIT: I use Minor Illusion, one of my cantrips, and
I puff up like a cloud of nightmare, and I glow,

2106
02:47:21,695 --> 02:47:31,974
and my eyes come alight. My tail whips, my fangs
get longer. Oh, I bet you did. I bet they paid you

2107
02:47:31,974 --> 02:47:40,979
so much. You tell my sister, I hope her face still
festers.

2108
02:47:40,979 --> 02:47:44,876
MATT: "Choice is made." And with that, (whoosh) he
vanishes from sight.

2109
02:47:44,876 --> 02:47:46,463
LIAM: Ooh!

2110
02:47:46,463 --> 02:47:48,040
MATT: That ends his turn.

2111
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:50,286
ORION: Wait, is he casting that? Did he cast
Vanish?

2112
02:47:50,286 --> 02:47:51,902
MATT: There was a casting, yes.

2113
02:47:51,902 --> 02:47:53,240
ORION: Sweet. Counterspell.

2114
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:54,758
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20.

2115
02:47:54,758 --> 02:47:56,166
ORION: 4th-level, too.

2116
02:47:56,166 --> 02:47:57,496
MATT: All right.

2117
02:47:57,496 --> 02:47:58,988
MARISHA: Do you mean 6th-level?

2118
02:47:58,988 --> 02:48:00,174
ORION: No.

2119
02:48:00,174 --> 02:48:04,300
MATT: It's a spell.

2120
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:06,960
ORION: (humming) What is this? What?

2121
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:15,023
MATT: Oh no, it just fails. You don't have to roll
for this one, this is Invisibility. So as he goes

2122
02:48:15,023 --> 02:48:20,281
to vanish, you "Oh!" as a reaction, pull out your
Counterspell, and his image shimmers, and then

2123
02:48:20,281 --> 02:48:23,813
returns. "Oh, that's not even fair."

2124
02:48:23,813 --> 02:48:28,692
ORION: I haven't gotten to do much today. And you
won't, either.

2125
02:48:28,692 --> 02:48:41,281
MATT: Very good. Well, he's then going to use his
move action to shift over this way to there. All

2126
02:48:41,281 --> 02:48:43,521
right, that ends him. Lillith, you're up.

2127
02:48:43,521 --> 02:48:50,363
KIT: Okay. I would like to...

2128
02:48:50,363 --> 02:48:56,039
LIAM: Buy a vowel.

2129
02:48:56,039 --> 02:48:59,798
SAM: Come on, Kit Buss! Come on, fuck him up! Kit
Buss!

2130
02:48:59,798 --> 02:49:03,170
KIT: Can I use Phantasmal Killer again, please?

2131
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:05,831
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah. All right, against
which one?

2132
02:49:05,831 --> 02:49:07,967
KIT: Against the Broker.

2133
02:49:07,967 --> 02:49:21,987
MATT: All righty, so he's going to go ahead and
make his wisdom saving throw. What's your DC?

2134
02:49:21,987 --> 02:49:23,606
KIT: 17.

2135
02:49:23,606 --> 02:49:26,515
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll 4d10 psychic
damage.

2136
02:49:26,515 --> 02:49:33,511
LAURA: 4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones?
Here's a gold one for you.

2137
02:49:33,511 --> 02:49:46,763
KIT: Thank you! Oh wow, I have so many pretty dice
right now! It's lovely. Ooh, yeah! Ooh, so 29.

2138
02:49:46,763 --> 02:49:50,570
LIAM: Little bit of Kit.

2139
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:57,379
MATT: This is blending in, because the spell
usually triggers on the start of his next turn.

2140
02:49:57,379 --> 02:50:03,501
This is you both going at the same time, and
conjoining your Minor Illusion fear into hitting

2141
02:50:03,501 --> 02:50:08,083
him with this spell and working. It's this
combination of everything hitting at once. All

2142
02:50:08,083 --> 02:50:14,726
right, and as that hits, you see, he looks at you,
and his expression goes from glee to terror. And

2143
02:50:14,726 --> 02:50:18,774
he's immediately reconsidering his decision here.
Do you want to stay where you are, or do you want

2144
02:50:18,774 --> 02:50:19,884
to move?

2145
02:50:19,884 --> 02:50:22,253
KIT: I'll stay where I am.

2146
02:50:22,253 --> 02:50:26,789
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're
up. Tiberius, you're up at the same time. We'll go

2147
02:50:26,789 --> 02:50:27,856
with Vex first.

2148
02:50:27,856 --> 02:50:35,141
LAURA: I want to tell Trinket to <i>cannonball</i> over
the two lined up right there!

2149
02:50:35,141 --> 02:50:46,420
MATT: All right, Trinket (galloping sounds) rolls
forward and (bear rolling sounds). Both of them

2150
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:56,788
try to move out of the way, they both get their dex
save. All right, so Broker manages to pull out of

2151
02:50:56,788 --> 02:51:02,754
the way just in time. However, the other, the big,
thicker character doesn't quite have the dexterity

2152
02:51:02,754 --> 02:51:14,462
to shift out of the way and takes the full impact.
Okay. He suffers 14 points of bludgeoning damage

2153
02:51:14,462 --> 02:51:16,045
as Trinket tears through.

2154
02:51:16,045 --> 02:51:19,896
LAURA: Eat it! Go, Trinket!

2155
02:51:19,896 --> 02:51:21,397
MATT: He is knocked prone.

2156
02:51:21,397 --> 02:51:24,260
LAURA: Good job, buddy! Little buddy!

2157
02:51:24,569 --> 02:51:29,090
MATT: That's Trinket's attack.

2158
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:34,922
LAURA: Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an
action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack

2159
02:51:34,922 --> 02:51:36,527
the Broker!

2160
02:51:36,654 --> 02:51:42,520
MATT: For how that works for you and your bear,
because that's his attack this turn.

2161
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:45,977
LAURA: I mean, yes. I'm assuming that's his
attack, or was that his move?

2162
02:51:45,977 --> 02:51:51,777
MATT: Well, that's his attack. It's been a while
since you attacked with Trinket.

2163
02:51:51,777 --> 02:51:58,621
LAURA: I get to have Trinket attack, and then I
get to attack.

2164
02:51:58,621 --> 02:52:00,205
MATT: Once, right.

2165
02:52:00,205 --> 02:52:07,488
LAURA: Wait, attack action plus Trinket attack. It
says one attack for me and two attacks for

2166
02:52:07,488 --> 02:52:09,223
Trinket.

2167
02:52:09,223 --> 02:52:10,862
LIAM: Trinket gets two attacks.

2168
02:52:10,862 --> 02:52:13,641
MATT: You can make one attack yourself while
commanding it, so you get one weapon attack.

2169
02:52:13,641 --> 02:52:15,999
LIAM: I think you should erase that and write
seven.

2170
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:20,367
MATT: As Trinket goes by, since it didn't hit him,
he gets an attack of opportunity on Trinket. Does

2171
02:52:20,367 --> 02:52:27,648
hit. Trinket does take seven points of slashing
damage from the Broker as he misses him and he

2172
02:52:27,648 --> 02:52:29,040
hits as he goes by.

2173
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:33,862
LAURA: But he's got armor on. All right, fine.

2174
02:52:33,862 --> 02:52:36,586
MATT: He rolled a 21 to hit.

2175
02:52:36,586 --> 02:52:44,668
LAURA: Okay, and then I'm going to shoot an arrow. Okay.
That would be 26.

2176
02:52:44,668 --> 02:52:47,755
MATT: 26 against the Broker? All right, go for
it.

2177
02:52:47,755 --> 02:52:59,945
LAURA: 14. I'm going to assume-- I mean, it's
probably way too far, but I want to keep my

2178
02:52:59,945 --> 02:53:04,802
Hunter's Mark on Lord Briarwood for the time
being. So I'm not going to break that, even though

2179
02:53:04,802 --> 02:53:09,363
he's probably far away, so it's just 14 damage to
the Broker.

2180
02:53:09,363 --> 02:53:19,063
MATT: All right. The Broker's going to make a
concentration check. Maintains concentration. All

2181
02:53:19,063 --> 02:53:23,721
right. As the arrow (whooshing) moves out of the
way, hits the armor, and splinters past, not

2182
02:53:23,721 --> 02:53:26,653
dealing any physical damage, but you see the
Broker is now visibly shaken by the two members of

2183
02:53:26,653 --> 02:53:32,484
the party and sweat is starting to bead. His
confidence he strolled into is quickly failing.

2184
02:53:32,484 --> 02:53:35,792
All right, that ends Vex's turn. Tiberius.

2185
02:53:35,792 --> 02:53:45,822
ORION: Okay. Can I see the Broker where I am at
now?

2186
02:53:45,822 --> 02:53:49,064
MATT: Grog's in the way. You can barely see.

2187
02:53:49,064 --> 02:53:57,993
ORION: I doesn't matter, I can see good enough.
I'm going to spend three sorcery points and

2188
02:53:57,993 --> 02:54:05,513
heighten my spell, which gives disadvantage on
both those two rolls. I'm going to cast a 5th-level

2189
02:54:05,513 --> 02:54:09,753
Fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two
buttholes.

2190
02:54:09,753 --> 02:54:11,544
MATT: Here?

2191
02:54:11,544 --> 02:54:14,607
LIAM: Don't hit Trinket!

2192
02:54:14,607 --> 02:54:16,951
MATT: Right there it would hit both of them and
not hit Trinket.

2193
02:54:16,951 --> 02:54:17,988
ORION: There it is.

2194
02:54:17,988 --> 02:54:20,990
MATT: Okay, so they both have disadvantage on
their saving throws?

2195
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:22,549
ORION: That's what heighten spell does.

2196
02:54:22,549 --> 02:54:27,360
MATT: Okay, cool. As you arc around the side, you
release the one single beam of flashing red

2197
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:32,809
energy, sparks at the end of the finger, lobs
forward. (explosion) With a gargantuan explosion,

2198
02:54:32,809 --> 02:54:38,009
red flames swirl into the area, sending the whole
area, the dark part of the night, open field

2199
02:54:38,009 --> 02:54:44,270
alight. You see all the green, dried grass is
immediately burnt to a black crisp. Go ahead and

2200
02:54:44,270 --> 02:54:48,168
roll damage. What's the DC?

2201
02:54:48,168 --> 02:54:50,126
ORION: 17.

2202
02:54:50,126 --> 02:54:54,838
MATT: Yeah, they both fail with disadvantage. Full
damage.

2203
02:54:54,838 --> 02:55:01,331
SAM: All the dice!

2204
02:55:01,331 --> 02:55:02,888
ORION: All of them.

2205
02:55:02,888 --> 02:55:05,139
LIAM: (laughs) Oh my god!

2206
02:55:05,139 --> 02:55:09,858
ORION: And then I'm going to spend one sorcery
point to empower the spell. And then I'm going to

2207
02:55:09,858 --> 02:55:18,015
use the six and I'm going to choose one, two,
three, and four, and five, and six to re-roll.

2208
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:21,761
LIAM: Think of how handy that would've been
against the Briarwoods.

2209
02:55:21,761 --> 02:55:24,878
ORION : Four, five, six. Okay, I'm going to roll
these.

2210
02:55:24,878 --> 02:55:27,284
SAM: Much better.

2211
02:55:27,284 --> 02:55:29,591
LAURA: That's amazing.

2212
02:55:29,591 --> 02:55:35,970
MATT: You can only use one metamagic option on a
spell when you cast it.

2213
02:55:35,970 --> 02:55:41,070
ORION: Empower spell is the only one that doubles
with any other metamagic. I can do it.

2214
02:55:41,070 --> 02:55:46,225
MATT: Oh interesting. Good to know. Thank you for
the heads up. That's cool. I like that.

2215
02:55:46,225 --> 02:55:50,388
SAM: 38. 41.

2216
02:55:50,388 --> 02:55:51,734
ORION: 46.

2217
02:55:51,734 --> 02:55:53,004
MATT: 46.

2218
02:55:53,004 --> 02:55:55,509
ORION: (spellcasting sound effect)

2219
02:55:55,509 --> 02:56:04,650
MATT: As the explosion bursts forth, the flames
dissipate. You can see the Broker there looking

2220
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:08,131
angry, frightened. Immediately takes some of the
flame...

2221
02:56:08,131 --> 02:56:11,780
ORION: Before he does that, I go (laughing), I
look over at Keyleth, and I use bonus action to

2222
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:14,901
cast Misty Step and I go right next to her and I
vanish.

2223
02:56:14,901 --> 02:56:22,645
MATT: Okay. You vanish behind her, and as he pulls
back the flames and then releases them they snake

2224
02:56:22,645 --> 02:56:27,141
between everyone and go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw.

2225
02:56:27,141 --> 02:56:32,590
ORION: I make it. But it's fire?

2226
02:56:32,590 --> 02:56:35,625
MATT: It is fire damage.

2227
02:56:35,625 --> 02:56:42,936
ORION: Good, instead of missing it I'm going to
(swoosh, gulps) swallow it. (grunts) That's 20. My

2228
02:56:42,936 --> 02:56:44,627
dex save was 20. Sorry.

2229
02:56:44,627 --> 02:56:47,175
MATT: Oh, okay, good thank you for the heads up on
that.

2230
02:56:47,175 --> 02:56:48,550
TRAVIS: You swallowed it?

2231
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:55,015
MATT: So you take half damage. The angry tiefling
hits you with a Hellish Rebuke.

2232
02:56:55,015 --> 02:57:00,806
ORION: Blowing smoke through my nose (snorts).

2233
02:57:00,806 --> 02:57:05,632
MATT: It would be seven damage. You take half
damage from fire, so that would be four fire

2234
02:57:05,632 --> 02:57:11,968
damage as you take the Hellish Rebuke's burst of
flaming, dark, arcane energy and (gulps) swallow

2235
02:57:11,968 --> 02:57:17,101
it and take it in. You blow it out the side of
your nostrils. And it burns, but damn does it look cool.

2236
02:57:17,101 --> 02:57:20,181
ORION: And that's my turn.

2237
02:57:20,181 --> 02:57:22,189
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2238
02:57:22,189 --> 02:57:25,829
SAM: Me? Shit. Is that the old lady over there?

2239
02:57:25,829 --> 02:57:27,287
MATT: Over here on this side, yeah.

2240
02:57:27,287 --> 02:57:33,479
SAM: Okay, I'll take a step towards her and I will
try-- it's never worked for me, it probably won't

2241
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:35,365
work. I'll try Eyebite on her.

2242
02:57:35,365 --> 02:57:38,885
LIAM: This is the time. Right here, right now.

2243
02:57:38,885 --> 02:57:43,991
SAM: What do I roll? I'm doing it through my Horn
of Clarity or whatever.

2244
02:57:43,991 --> 02:57:52,481
MATT: All right, so it's a wisdom saving throw on her
end. What's the DC on that? Is it 19?

2245
02:57:52,481 --> 02:57:53,386
SAM: 19.

2246
02:57:53,386 --> 02:57:55,497
MATT: Okay. So no, that does not make it. So
what're you choosing?

2247
02:57:55,497 --> 02:58:03,018
SAM: Okay. I choose Sleep. (singing) Rock-a-bye,
old lady.

2248
02:58:03,018 --> 02:58:07,932
MATT: So she turns around, she's holding this
gnarled wand in her hand, as she comes around

2249
02:58:07,932 --> 02:58:15,891
she gives you this strange look and goes "What?" And
falls unconscious on the ground asleep.

2250
02:58:15,891 --> 02:58:18,272
MARISHA: That's awesome.

2251
02:58:18,272 --> 02:58:20,331
LIAM: "I didn't watch Matlock--"

2252
02:58:20,331 --> 02:58:32,002
SAM: And then I'll just inspire our new tiefling
friend with a little sexy dance.

2253
02:58:32,002 --> 02:58:37,553
KIT: Is he always like this?

2254
02:58:37,553 --> 02:58:40,350
LAURA: Yes, he is. Don't you feel so inspired?

2255
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:42,536
KIT: Oh, you have no idea.

2256
02:58:42,536 --> 02:58:50,404
MATT: You take a d10 inspiration dice. It makes
you laugh. It's less of an attraction thing and

2257
02:58:50,404 --> 02:58:55,352
more of a, "Oh, gnomes. They're so small."

2258
02:58:55,352 --> 02:58:57,553
KIT: Oh, how special.

2259
02:58:57,553 --> 02:59:01,754
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're
up.

2260
02:59:01,754 --> 02:59:07,301
TRAVIS: All right, everybody's doing new
stuff. With 50-foot speed, can I get to the far

2261
02:59:07,301 --> 02:59:10,584
side of the old lady that's sleeping?

2262
02:59:10,584 --> 02:59:11,717
MATT: Yeah.

2263
02:59:11,717 --> 02:59:15,322
TRAVIS: Can I get like behind her so I can-- I
need the laser pointer.

2264
02:59:15,322 --> 02:59:18,704
TALIESIN: You want to get right there, right?

2265
02:59:18,704 --> 02:59:20,959
TRAVIS: Yes. Yeah, on the opposite side of her
from where I am.

2266
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:23,000
SAM: She's asleep. What are you going to do?

2267
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,446
LIAM: Kill that motherfucker!

2268
02:59:24,446 --> 02:59:25,910
MATT: You can get there.

2269
02:59:25,910 --> 02:59:27,400
TRAVIS: That's what I'd like to do.

2270
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:30,741
MARISHA: She will wake up. Unless you cleave her
in half, she will wake up.

2271
02:59:30,741 --> 02:59:32,620
LAURA: It's Grog. He doesn't give a shit about
that.

2272
02:59:32,620 --> 02:59:38,843
TRAVIS: I take out the Javelin of Lightning. I
whisper the command word, which is Penelope, and I

2273
02:59:38,843 --> 02:59:49,793
throw it in a straight line, which will hit all
three of them, in a five-foot-wide line that extends

2274
02:59:49,793 --> 02:59:51,342
120 feet.

2275
02:59:51,617 --> 02:59:53,055
LAURA: You're so smart, Grog!

2276
02:59:53,055 --> 02:59:54,317
TALIESIN: You just did math!

2277
02:59:54,317 --> 02:59:55,953
LAURA: Look at you!

2278
02:59:55,953 --> 03:00:00,495
When it comes to battle, he knows things.

2279
03:00:00,495 --> 03:00:04,982
MATT: All right, so that's five foot wide, so
it'll hit him and one of these, or her and one of

2280
03:00:04,982 --> 03:00:08,350
these two guys. It hits something in a five-foot
line.

2281
03:00:08,350 --> 03:00:09,574
TRAVIS: The guy that's standing.

2282
03:00:09,574 --> 03:00:10,938
LAURA: Yeah, the Broker. Get the Broker.

2283
03:00:10,938 --> 03:00:18,464
MATT: So you pull it out and as you throw it
downward. The javelin goes from a metallic blade

2284
03:00:18,464 --> 03:00:27,496
into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams
downward. Penelope does not-- not Penelope. You

2285
03:00:27,496 --> 03:00:33,177
keep shouting it at me. The old woman on the
ground gets no saving throw because she's

2286
03:00:33,177 --> 03:00:35,789
unconscious and she takes double damage.

2287
03:00:35,789 --> 03:00:37,467
TRAVIS: Double damage?

2288
03:00:37,467 --> 03:00:41,115
MATT: So 4d6.

2289
03:00:41,115 --> 03:00:48,216
TRAVIS: 4d6. 14.

2290
03:00:48,216 --> 03:00:52,684
LIAM: Killed that old woman so good.

2291
03:00:52,684 --> 03:00:58,724
TRAVIS: And if he makes a saving throw of a DC 13,
it's halved.

2292
03:00:58,724 --> 03:01:11,025
MATT: The javelin arcs through and goes towards
there, and then he does make his dexterity saving

2293
03:01:11,025 --> 03:01:13,863
throw against that. He's a pretty dexterous guy.

2294
03:01:13,863 --> 03:01:16,077
TRAVIS: It takes a little shock, though.

2295
03:01:16,077 --> 03:01:20,489
MATT: Right, so it takes a little bit of damage
which was, what was it you rolled, was it a 14? So

2296
03:01:20,489 --> 03:01:25,441
it takes seven points of lightning damage for
that, and then make a ranged attack on the actual

2297
03:01:25,441 --> 03:01:26,761
javelin.

2298
03:01:26,761 --> 03:01:33,455
TRAVIS: What does that do? I don't even have that
on here. I have no idea.

2299
03:01:33,455 --> 03:01:38,547
MATT: Oh, sorry. That was against the target, so
since he was the target, he takes the impact. The

2300
03:01:38,547 --> 03:01:45,597
lightning bolt arcs through the old woman. She
(screams) shakes awake, screaming as the bolt arcs

2301
03:01:45,597 --> 03:01:49,821
upward from the ground, and right before it goes
toward the Broker, as he rears back in fear, it

2302
03:01:49,821 --> 03:01:55,798
solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams
into the front of his torso. He's like, (grunting,

2303
03:01:55,798 --> 03:02:04,415
gasping). He pulls it out. Shakes it for a second,
looking at it, confused.

2304
03:02:04,415 --> 03:02:06,873
TRAVIS: I look at Tiberius and I go, I did magic!

2305
03:02:06,873 --> 03:02:11,211
ORION: It was very impressive. Good job, Grog!

2306
03:02:11,211 --> 03:02:13,010
TRAVIS: Thank you! Penelope.

2307
03:02:13,010 --> 03:02:15,135
ORION: That's my mother's name.

2308
03:02:15,135 --> 03:02:19,993
LAURA: Oh no, he got up.

2309
03:02:19,993 --> 03:02:21,979
MATT: The guy gets up and only has a half move.

2310
03:02:21,979 --> 03:02:28,161
LAURA: Can he get that close?

2311
03:02:28,161 --> 03:02:36,942
MATT: On half movement, yeah. Runs up to you. As
he does so you can see, holding on his side, gets

2312
03:02:36,942 --> 03:02:44,680
up and goes bolting towards you, arcing around
the side.

2313
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:47,728
MARISHA: He runs, he runs smack-dab into my wall.
My arcane--

2314
03:02:47,728 --> 03:02:50,998
MATT: Anti-life Shell. The Anti-life Shell does--

2315
03:02:50,998 --> 03:02:56,933
MARISHA: Blocks living things. They can't come
in.

2316
03:02:56,933 --> 03:02:59,152
ORION: Unless you invite them.

2317
03:02:59,152 --> 03:03:01,064
MARISHA: Like vampires.

2318
03:03:01,064 --> 03:03:05,240
MATT: It was a ten-foot radius you said?

2319
03:03:05,240 --> 03:03:06,497
MARISHA: Yeah.

2320
03:03:06,497 --> 03:03:07,733
MATT: Okay.

2321
03:03:07,733 --> 03:03:11,253
LIAM: Vax'ildan flips him the double birds as he
hits the wall.

2322
03:03:11,253 --> 03:03:12,916
LAURA: From inside the wall.

2323
03:03:12,916 --> 03:03:23,354
MATT: So he's unable to, just runs forward, hits
the barrier, skids past, hold his place there

2324
03:03:23,354 --> 03:03:24,856
instead then.

2325
03:03:24,856 --> 03:03:26,651
LIAM: That's unfortunate!

2326
03:03:26,651 --> 03:03:30,067
MATT: However, has a spear.

2327
03:03:30,067 --> 03:03:31,815
LAURA: Oh shit.

2328
03:03:31,815 --> 03:03:34,594
(laughter)

2329
03:03:34,594 --> 03:03:40,861
MATT: Still rushes around with it, both hands on
it, arcing towards you with it. That is going to be--

2330
03:03:40,861 --> 03:03:45,101
LIAM: Can I use Uncanny Dodge with it? Or is it
too late?

2331
03:03:45,101 --> 03:03:50,987
MATT: Well, that's okay, it rolled a three to hit,
plus eight, that's going to be an 11 so no. It

2332
03:03:50,987 --> 03:04:00,048
just (whiffing) It swings wide with the spear.
This is going very poorly for them. All right,

2333
03:04:00,048 --> 03:04:01,185
Vax, it's your turn now.

2334
03:04:01,185 --> 03:04:07,979
LIAM: Okay, so I look around at all these
amazing people that I am so blessed to be with and

2335
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:13,488
barely even looking, I just go dagger, dagger,
dagger over this asshole's head at the Broker.

2336
03:04:13,488 --> 03:04:21,968
Yeah. The first one is, not that great, but it's
all right. It's an 18. These guys are dickheads.

2337
03:04:21,968 --> 03:04:25,118
MATT: All right, 18 against the Broker just barely
hits.

2338
03:04:25,118 --> 03:04:37,209
LIAM: All right. That's ten points of damage. The
second dagger hits him, I hope. 19?

2339
03:04:37,209 --> 03:04:39,752
MATT: All right, that does hit, yeah.

2340
03:04:39,752 --> 03:04:47,122
LIAM: For ten points of damage. And then I'll
throw my Dagger of Venom at him, see what happens.

2341
03:04:47,122 --> 03:04:56,549
Oh, the same hit, same amount. The last one hit.
This one hits. That is three, six, nine. Plus, he

2342
03:04:56,549 --> 03:04:59,985
has to make a saving throw against a DC 15 for
poison.

2343
03:04:59,985 --> 03:05:02,152
MATT: Constitution. He is going to fail that.

2344
03:05:02,152 --> 03:05:09,340
LIAM: Yeah, go fuck yourself. That's not the right
die is what that is. Let's see, poison damage is--

2345
03:05:09,340 --> 03:05:16,182
that's not great. Ten. Ten points of poison. You
are awesome! (whooshing)

2346
03:05:16,182 --> 03:05:20,829
SAM: Wait, what if Lillith is the bad guy instead
of the good guy?

2347
03:05:20,829 --> 03:05:23,432
LIAM: Kit Buss is not a bad guy!

2348
03:05:23,432 --> 03:05:26,563
MATT: All right, so you're staying where you are?

2349
03:05:26,563 --> 03:05:33,130
LIAM: Where I am. I'll stay where I am

2350
03:05:33,130 --> 03:05:35,941
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

2351
03:05:35,941 --> 03:05:48,044
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to walk to the very edge
of the spell right here, so I'm standing one

2352
03:05:48,044 --> 03:05:55,304
closer to our friend there. Not just to you. I
want to be close to the big strong schmuck.

2353
03:05:55,304 --> 03:05:57,093
MATT: Okay, so right there?

2354
03:05:57,093 --> 03:06:01,058
TALIESIN: Is the Broker holding anything? Is he,
is he using a weapon?

2355
03:06:01,058 --> 03:06:05,604
MATT: The Broker you see has like a shortsword
out. He's currently tossing it and catching it.

2356
03:06:05,604 --> 03:06:06,860
TALIESIN: Just a shortsword?

2357
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:12,964
MATT: Or he's tossing it and catching it but like
(grunts). He's having a bad day. The Broker was

2358
03:06:12,964 --> 03:06:14,680
not prepared for Vox Machina.

2359
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:21,551
TALIESIN: Okay. Before I start to do anything I'm
going to look at him, look him in the eye: What is

2360
03:06:21,551 --> 03:06:27,781
wrong with you? Don't you see there is nothing
here for you? Run away before you die! There is no

2361
03:06:27,781 --> 03:06:31,493
option! And I'm just going to start unloading.
Natural 20!

2362
03:06:31,493 --> 03:06:34,840
(yelling)

2363
03:06:34,840 --> 03:06:36,201
LIAM: Damn, son!

2364
03:06:36,201 --> 03:06:37,775
TALIESIN: Pepperbox.

2365
03:06:37,775 --> 03:06:39,445
MARISHA: What is wrong with you?

2366
03:06:39,445 --> 03:06:44,829
LIAM: Percival de something something something de
Rolo the III, you badass motherfucker!

2367
03:06:44,829 --> 03:06:48,139
TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.

2368
03:06:48,139 --> 03:06:50,522
MATT: That's to the Broker?

2369
03:06:50,522 --> 03:06:52,759
TALIESIN: To the Broker. I'm just shooting at the
Broker.

2370
03:06:52,759 --> 03:06:55,663
MATT: 16 points? That is doubling the dice?

2371
03:06:55,663 --> 03:07:00,462
TALIESIN: That is doubling both of the dice. Now a
sharpshooter shot.

2372
03:07:00,462 --> 03:07:03,063
MATT: The Broker can't do anything. It already
used its reaction.

2373
03:07:03,063 --> 03:07:09,010
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot misses. And another
shot, seven, 19?

2374
03:07:09,010 --> 03:07:09,951
MATT: 19 hits.

2375
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:16,768
TALIESIN: All right, cool. That's eight points of
damage. Blowing an action surge and firing three

2376
03:07:16,768 --> 03:07:18,207
more times.

2377
03:07:18,207 --> 03:07:21,904
SAM: Three more? That seems terribly unfair.

2378
03:07:21,904 --> 03:07:30,405
TALIESIN: That's 25... that's ten points of
damage, plus four points of fire damage.

2379
03:07:30,405 --> 03:07:45,970
Sharpshooter shot. That's a 22. That's 21 points
of damage. Another sharpshooter shot with ice

2380
03:07:45,970 --> 03:07:56,845
fire. Finally, I get the breakdown on that one. The
gun jammed. I put it away.

2381
03:07:56,845 --> 03:08:00,695
MARISHA: But that was awesome. That was pretty
dope.

2382
03:08:00,695 --> 03:08:05,547
TALIESIN: How many fired shots did I get? Was that
five shots or six shots?

2383
03:08:05,547 --> 03:08:08,803
MATT: That, that was five shots. Well, all in all,
it was six shots, but five hits.

2384
03:08:08,803 --> 03:08:12,741
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm out of-- all right. I don't
have any more actions.

2385
03:08:12,741 --> 03:08:14,972
MATT: Yeah. That's okay (chuckles). First and
foremost, How do you want to do this?

2386
03:08:14,972 --> 03:08:17,738
(cheering)

2387
03:08:17,738 --> 03:08:20,641
TRAVIS: Did you see the nostril? His little
nostril twitch.

2388
03:08:20,641 --> 03:08:26,482
MATT: I feel bad for him.

2389
03:08:26,482 --> 03:08:28,787
(laughter)

2390
03:08:28,787 --> 03:08:34,218
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to do something weird
here and I'm going to hold you onto this. I'm

2391
03:08:34,218 --> 03:08:38,407
going to get a little weird, and I'm taking
straight chest shots and I'm just firing chest

2392
03:08:38,407 --> 03:08:44,171
shots, and I'm just making a hole the size of a
baseball in his chest. And as it happens, as I

2393
03:08:44,171 --> 03:08:48,726
keep unloading, the gun still breaks and I'm still
pulling the trigger.

2394
03:08:48,726 --> 03:08:52,056
MATT: (booming, gasping, coughing)

2395
03:08:52,056 --> 03:08:58,000
TALIESIN: (yelling) You fool, your soul is
forfeit! Die! Die! I'm going to look at the other

2396
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,740
two and start pulling out my bigger gun.

2397
03:09:00,740 --> 03:09:05,997
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

2398
03:09:05,997 --> 03:09:07,862
TALIESIN: And putting on the fucking mask.

2399
03:09:07,862 --> 03:09:09,764
MATT: With a d6 inspiration dice.

2400
03:09:09,764 --> 03:09:11,472
LIAM: Picked a bad day to do your job, son!

2401
03:09:11,472 --> 03:09:13,644
TALIESIN: A d6 inspiration die?

2402
03:09:13,644 --> 03:09:16,068
MARISHA: And advantage. With advantage and a d6.

2403
03:09:16,068 --> 03:09:24,010
TALIESIN: Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with
intimidation, 19.

2404
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:25,637
MATT: Okay.

2405
03:09:25,637 --> 03:09:28,701
TALIESIN: Mask, gun, fuck it.

2406
03:09:28,701 --> 03:09:36,055
MATT: Standing there, smoking, giant hole,
Tombstone style, in the center of his chest. There

2407
03:09:36,055 --> 03:09:41,073
would be no dripping, except for the cauterization
of the heat round that exploded in his chest and

2408
03:09:41,073 --> 03:09:49,079
is a blackened, cinderous tube where once there
was a chest cavity. The Broker (death rattle,

2409
03:09:49,079 --> 03:09:55,955
thud) falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral
of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound

2410
03:09:55,955 --> 03:10:01,225
on the ground. As you stare at the other two,
screaming that out, you can see the old woman

2411
03:10:01,225 --> 03:10:07,454
who's still on the ground. (panicked gasps) Looks
extremely out of place and freaked out.

2412
03:10:07,454 --> 03:10:09,687
SAM: Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down.

2413
03:10:09,687 --> 03:10:15,742
MATT: The masked individual, from what you can
tell behind the eyes of the mask, does not seem

2414
03:10:15,742 --> 03:10:17,895
emotionally affected by this.

2415
03:10:17,895 --> 03:10:23,180
TALIESIN: Also, just checking, does my glove still
have a charge, by the way?

2416
03:10:23,180 --> 03:10:27,209
MATT: It may.

2417
03:10:27,209 --> 03:10:30,977
TALIESIN: Okay. I mean, is there any indication,
like it would have a slight glow to it.

2418
03:10:30,977 --> 03:10:34,917
MATT: There is a slight vibration. That ends your
turn?

2419
03:10:34,917 --> 03:10:36,329
TALIESIN: That is the end of my turn.

2420
03:10:36,329 --> 03:10:43,824
MATT: All right. The old woman gets up and is
like, (panicked gasps).

2421
03:10:43,824 --> 03:10:48,428
LIAM: (old lady voice) I feel happy. I feel
alive.

2422
03:10:48,428 --> 03:10:56,324
SAM: You're in Atlantic City. Everything's okay.

2423
03:10:56,324 --> 03:11:06,152
MATT: As a bonus action, casts Misty Step and appearing
30 feet over here.

2424
03:11:06,152 --> 03:11:07,516
TRAVIS: Do I get to swing?

2425
03:11:07,516 --> 03:11:10,556
MATT: No. Because Misty Step happens.

2426
03:11:10,556 --> 03:11:12,518
TRAVIS: Damn Misty and her steps.

2427
03:11:12,518 --> 03:11:19,588
MATT: She stands up and vanishes in a swirl of
vapor. She appears a little ways away in the field

2428
03:11:19,588 --> 03:11:23,915
and immediately, (mumbles a spell).

2429
03:11:23,915 --> 03:11:28,807
ORION: Counterspell! 5th-level. Fuck it.

2430
03:11:28,807 --> 03:11:36,194
MATT: You would be able to, because it has been your
turn, you would have your reaction back. So yes,

2431
03:11:36,194 --> 03:11:42,001
you could. So go ahead and roll a d20.

2432
03:11:42,001 --> 03:11:47,163
LAURA: Matt's like, damn you and your
Counterspells. You're ruining my plan.

2433
03:11:47,163 --> 03:11:52,945
ORION: 23.

2434
03:11:52,945 --> 03:12:02,062
MATT: (laughs) So she (mumbles a spell, gasps).

2435
03:12:02,062 --> 03:12:05,851
(laughter)

2436
03:12:05,851 --> 03:12:13,062
TRAVIS: That's the best running I've ever seen!
The little gait!

2437
03:12:13,062 --> 03:12:18,843
MATT: Tries to run away, the slippery wet grass,
she slips a little bit as she's trying to get away now.

2438
03:12:18,843 --> 03:12:20,039
LAURA: I feel bad for her.

2439
03:12:20,039 --> 03:12:24,025
MATT: That ends her turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2440
03:12:24,025 --> 03:12:33,634
MARISHA: Upon seeing Percy go absolutely insane
and screaming "your soul is now forfeit," out of

2441
03:12:33,634 --> 03:12:45,179
shock, my Anti-Life Shell dissipates, and I spend
my action staring at him.

2442
03:12:45,179 --> 03:12:48,593
MATT: All right.

2443
03:12:48,593 --> 03:12:53,172
LIAM: Wow. Going for the roleplay, not the
damage.

2444
03:12:53,172 --> 03:12:56,742
MATT: The Broker's not getting a turn. Lillith,
you're up.

2445
03:12:56,742 --> 03:13:01,223
KIT: Okay. I would like to use Animate Dead on the
Broker, please.

2446
03:13:01,223 --> 03:13:06,722
LIAM: (gasps) You nasty woman, you.

2447
03:13:06,722 --> 03:13:12,373
LAURA: He's so happy about it.

2448
03:13:12,373 --> 03:13:18,896
MATT: You can begin using it, because it's a
one-minute casting time. You have to get closer

2449
03:13:18,896 --> 03:13:20,285
because you're probably a ways away.

2450
03:13:20,285 --> 03:13:21,677
KIT: Right. Okay.

2451
03:13:21,677 --> 03:13:23,488
LIAM: You've got a naughty streak.

2452
03:13:23,488 --> 03:13:26,153
KIT: It's my family. I cannot help it.

2453
03:13:26,153 --> 03:13:30,373
MATT: We'll say, from there you begin
concentrating on Animate Dead as you begin pulling

2454
03:13:30,373 --> 03:13:38,062
through and speaking in guttural tones that have
multiple layers of tonality and volume. It's this

2455
03:13:38,062 --> 03:13:46,628
weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins
to speak. You can see now the smoking, ruined body

2456
03:13:46,628 --> 03:13:54,964
of the Broker begins to shift and twitch on its
own. So that'll conclude your turn, Lillith. Vex

2457
03:13:54,964 --> 03:13:56,618
and Tiberius, you guys are up.

2458
03:13:56,618 --> 03:13:58,912
MARISHA: You've got asshole.

2459
03:13:58,912 --> 03:14:16,052
LAURA: I'm going to attack him with a bow. I'm
going to attack him with my Entangle arrow.

2460
03:14:16,052 --> 03:14:17,442
MATT: Okay.

2461
03:14:17,442 --> 03:14:18,884
LAURA: All right.

2462
03:14:18,884 --> 03:14:20,212
MATT: The big guy?

2463
03:14:20,212 --> 03:14:24,556
LAURA: Yeah. The guy in the mask. He's the only
one left right? Oh, the old lady's still running

2464
03:14:24,556 --> 03:14:27,542
away? All right, I'll attack the guy in the mask.

2465
03:14:27,542 --> 03:14:29,566
LIAM: That old lady has to die!

2466
03:14:29,566 --> 03:14:31,709
LAURA: That's a 28.

2467
03:14:31,709 --> 03:14:33,602
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

2468
03:14:33,602 --> 03:14:42,875
LAURA: All right, 15. Plus Entangle, whatever.

2469
03:14:42,875 --> 03:14:50,983
MATT: All right. Good to know. And so as you pull back
the arrow and release it, there is that-- the way

2470
03:14:50,983 --> 03:14:55,008
that you constructed it, there's just this pouch
of very thick gooey-- is this the spell or is it

2471
03:14:55,008 --> 03:14:56,802
the actual arrow constructed by Percy?

2472
03:14:56,802 --> 03:14:58,352
LAURA: It's the arrow.

2473
03:14:58,352 --> 03:15:02,557
MATT: Right, the one that he built? So what
happens is that the front of the arrow, it doesn't

2474
03:15:02,557 --> 03:15:06,387
do any actual damage on the impact. Instead what it
does is it, when it smacks into it, there's a

2475
03:15:06,387 --> 03:15:14,500
pouch in the front that detonates from the impact
and sends this very quick-setting tar, like glue

2476
03:15:14,500 --> 03:15:20,667
substance. That just spatters across the body and
lower torso, it expands like a foam. There's no

2477
03:15:20,667 --> 03:15:27,823
damage on that one, but it's currently (grunts)
grappled by it and cannot move from its place.

2478
03:15:27,823 --> 03:15:34,522
LAURA: Awesome. And so I'll shoot another arrow at
the other lady.

2479
03:15:34,522 --> 03:15:36,594
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll for an attack.

2480
03:15:36,594 --> 03:15:41,553
LAURA: I know she's running away, but she's a bad
guy. I didn't hit her, though.

2481
03:15:41,553 --> 03:15:43,107
MATT: What did you roll?

2482
03:15:43,107 --> 03:15:44,351
LAURA: 16.

2483
03:15:44,351 --> 03:15:51,625
MATT: Heh. It's funny-- mages don't have a lot of
armor. Even with mage armor, you manage to hit her

2484
03:15:51,625 --> 03:15:55,050
square in the back. Go ahead and roll damage.

2485
03:15:55,050 --> 03:15:57,033
LAURA: 16.

2486
03:15:57,033 --> 03:16:07,597
MATT: She goes (cries out) and stumbles, and
catches herself and gets back up and you can see

2487
03:16:07,597 --> 03:16:12,638
the arrow sticking straight up out of her back.
Probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade.

2488
03:16:12,638 --> 03:16:14,883
MARISHA: This is becoming a Monty Python sketch.

2489
03:16:14,883 --> 03:16:20,588
LIAM: (old lady voice) I feel fine. I feel happy.

2490
03:16:20,588 --> 03:16:27,447
MATT: Trinket growls (growls menacingly). She
goes, (terrified shriek) and yelps out as the

2491
03:16:27,447 --> 03:16:28,745
giant bear--

2492
03:16:28,745 --> 03:16:30,899
TRAVIS: Will you start running for us again,
please?

2493
03:16:30,899 --> 03:16:33,609
MATT: When we get to her turn. I'm saving it.

2494
03:16:33,609 --> 03:16:35,832
LAURA: I'm going to command Trinket to run after
her.

2495
03:16:35,832 --> 03:16:38,675
MATT: What's Trinket's movement?

2496
03:16:38,675 --> 03:16:40,891
LIAM: This is like an afternoon at the gym for
us.

2497
03:16:40,891 --> 03:16:46,573
LAURA: I don't have any idea. I don't know.

2498
03:16:46,573 --> 03:16:52,970
MATT: Actually, I have it here. Trinket's movement
is 40 feet. Okay, that's as far as Trinket can get

2499
03:16:52,970 --> 03:16:56,971
right there. I have a little Trinket cheat sheet.

2500
03:16:56,971 --> 03:16:59,704
TALIESIN: That is the tiniest cheat sheet ever.

2501
03:16:59,704 --> 03:17:07,654
LIAM: Littlest character sheet ever. Can you hold
that up again? Look how tiny it is! Aw, that big

2502
03:17:07,654 --> 03:17:10,188
bear and that tiny piece of paper.

2503
03:17:10,188 --> 03:17:11,392
MATT: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.

2504
03:17:11,537 --> 03:17:14,514
SAM: Wait, the guy in the mask is prone?

2505
03:17:14,514 --> 03:17:19,446
MATT: The guy in the mask is currently grappled.
His lower body is currently held in this weird

2506
03:17:19,446 --> 03:17:23,606
tar-like substance. He's like, (grunts) trying to
break free.

2507
03:17:23,606 --> 03:17:29,746
SAM: I only get one 6th-level spell but it says on
Eyebite that every subsequent action, I can do it

2508
03:17:29,746 --> 03:17:32,685
again.

2509
03:17:32,685 --> 03:17:34,702
MATT: You just choose somebody else to do it to,
yeah.

2510
03:17:34,702 --> 03:17:38,546
SAM: I'm going to do it to her again. To the old
lady again.

2511
03:17:38,546 --> 03:17:45,043
MATT: Let me see if you can. For another creature.
But can't target a creature again-- oh, if it

2512
03:17:45,043 --> 03:17:48,546
succeeded on a saving throw. You're right, so she
can. So what do you want to do?

2513
03:17:48,546 --> 03:17:52,199
LAURA: I think it's Tiberius's turn. He and I
have the same initiative.

2514
03:17:52,199 --> 03:17:54,414
MATT: Oh, that's right, sorry about that.

2515
03:17:54,414 --> 03:17:56,314
SAM: Oh, are you going to hold?

2516
03:17:56,314 --> 03:17:59,608
MATT: So he waits for you to finish. But he can
hold his turn.

2517
03:17:59,608 --> 03:18:04,174
SAM: I'll just run up, as far as I need to be
within 60 feet and do it again to her.

2518
03:18:04,174 --> 03:18:07,735
MATT: Yeah, she's within range. And what're you
doing?

2519
03:18:07,735 --> 03:18:10,816
SAM: Just fall asleep again. Back to sleep.

2520
03:18:10,816 --> 03:18:25,389
MATT: That is a 17. Nope. (panicked breathing)
Falls asleep on the ground. With the arrow (arrow

2521
03:18:25,389 --> 03:18:29,960
twang) right out of the back. And you acquiesce to
Tiberius. It's your go.

2522
03:18:29,960 --> 03:18:39,197
SAM: Oh, and I'll inspire him. With a musical
fart. (fart noise)

2523
03:18:39,197 --> 03:18:43,699
ORION: That was a wonderful toot, Scanlan!

2524
03:18:43,699 --> 03:18:45,083
SAM: Yes, thank you.

2525
03:18:45,083 --> 03:18:53,184
MATT: All right, d10 inspiration die. Tiberius,
it's your go.

2526
03:18:53,184 --> 03:19:06,898
ORION: Where do I put this d10? Doesn't matter.
Cool. I'm going to go as far as I can towards the

2527
03:19:06,898 --> 03:19:08,376
old broad.

2528
03:19:08,376 --> 03:19:13,634
MARISHA: We're focusing so much on this poor old
woman and there's big intimidating--

2529
03:19:13,634 --> 03:19:18,330
LIAM: Poor old woman? She's an evil mercenary. She
deserves to be taken out!

2530
03:19:18,330 --> 03:19:24,156
ORION: He hasn't taken any damage, has he?

2531
03:19:24,156 --> 03:19:25,776
MATT: He's taken quite a bit of damage

2532
03:19:25,776 --> 03:19:30,770
LIAM: Don't be ageist! That is an evil bitch! She
needs to be killed.

2533
03:19:30,770 --> 03:19:31,917
TRAVIS: Ageist?

2534
03:19:31,917 --> 03:19:35,500
MATT: All right, Tiberius, what're you doing?
She's currently asleep on the ground. This guy's

2535
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:37,108
like, (grunts).

2536
03:19:37,108 --> 03:19:47,165
ORION: Am I within 60 feet of the old lady? That's
pretty far still. Don't know whether I am or not.

2537
03:19:47,165 --> 03:19:48,780
MATT: Nope, she's just out of the range.

2538
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:50,721
SAM: I've fallen, and I can't get up!

2539
03:19:50,721 --> 03:20:01,501
ORION: Okay. I am within 120 right? So what I'm
going to do instead, is I'm going to look down and

2540
03:20:01,501 --> 03:20:06,215
I'm going to pull out my Krull Blade and I'm going to throw
it in the air and cast Telekinesis on it

2541
03:20:06,215 --> 03:20:07,742
(spinning).

2542
03:20:07,742 --> 03:20:12,447
MATT: Okay. As you do it catches itself, spinning
in the air up ahead of you, (spinning) this

2543
03:20:12,447 --> 03:20:17,119
strange vibrating high-pitched whine sound as the blades
are spinning in rapid circular motion.

2544
03:20:17,119 --> 03:20:22,678
ORION: And I'm going to go, (swishing) and I'm
going to huck it at the chick.

2545
03:20:22,678 --> 03:20:25,565
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a spell attack
roll.

2546
03:20:25,565 --> 03:20:29,835
ORION: That's 31.

2547
03:20:29,835 --> 03:20:36,851
MATT: Yeah. It's also a critical hit because she's
currently asleep. So it's an auto-crit. So go

2548
03:20:36,851 --> 03:20:44,795
ahead and roll 5d4. A d4 for each dagger on the
spinning blade, spinning at high speed. Plus five.

2549
03:20:44,795 --> 03:20:47,393
Or 5d4 times two plus five.

2550
03:20:47,393 --> 03:20:50,283
MARISHA: 5d4 times two plus five?

2551
03:20:50,283 --> 03:20:54,898
MATT: Yep. So just roll 5d4 and then multiply
everything by two.

2552
03:20:54,898 --> 03:21:00,688
ORION: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.

2553
03:21:00,688 --> 03:21:09,395
MATT: So 26 plus five is 31 points of damage. The
unconscious woman face down on the ground, the

2554
03:21:09,395 --> 03:21:19,749
blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out
of her back. Spraying a bit of gore across the

2555
03:21:19,749 --> 03:21:25,713
nearby grass. Thankfully, she was asleep, so she
probably didn't feel it, it was so fast. But she

2556
03:21:25,713 --> 03:21:28,681
is definitively gone.

2557
03:21:28,681 --> 03:21:31,475
MARISHA: We are being sadistic today.

2558
03:21:31,475 --> 03:21:40,464
ORION: And I'll bring it back to me. I'll keep it
hovering, maintain the spell. I'm going to bonus

2559
03:21:40,464 --> 03:21:44,662
action Misty Step towards where Grog is. That's my
turn.

2560
03:21:44,662 --> 03:21:52,579
MATT: I'll say for the sake of brevity at this
point, because you have a glued guy, and the

2561
03:21:52,579 --> 03:21:57,807
entire team pretty much at full health here, over
time you all slowly gather around the guy who's

2562
03:21:57,807 --> 03:22:10,147
glued to the ground. And he's fighting at first,
(grunts) and you see he lowers his head, giving

2563
03:22:10,147 --> 03:22:11,884
into his fate.

2564
03:22:11,884 --> 03:22:16,480
ORION: Smart to not test your fate, boy.

2565
03:22:16,480 --> 03:22:20,529
TRAVIS: Lillith, can I go play t-ball with his
head?

2566
03:22:20,529 --> 03:22:27,271
LIAM: No. Let him live. Let this one live.

2567
03:22:27,271 --> 03:22:29,035
TRAVIS: What, we're letting people live now?

2568
03:22:29,035 --> 03:22:37,274
MATT: At which point the head lifts he goes: "No.
Kill me, give me honor. I have fallen."

2569
03:22:37,274 --> 03:22:39,152
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry I retract that.

2570
03:22:39,152 --> 03:22:40,968
ORION: Krull Blade in the neck.

2571
03:22:40,968 --> 03:22:46,855
MARISHA: Oh you just elbowed me.

2572
03:22:46,855 --> 03:22:49,429
LIAM: Did you just hit Keyleth's funny bone?

2573
03:22:49,429 --> 03:22:50,968
MARISHA: Yes, right in the funny bone.

2574
03:22:50,968 --> 03:22:53,065
ORION: It's kind of funny.

2575
03:22:53,065 --> 03:22:54,835
LIAM: Grog, will you kill this guy?

2576
03:22:54,835 --> 03:22:59,116
KIT: If honor is what he wants, do not give it to
him. Let him live.

2577
03:22:59,116 --> 03:23:05,623
LAURA: Ooh, I like it. I walk up and I take his
mask off.

2578
03:23:05,623 --> 03:23:09,343
MATT: All right, you pull the mask off--

2579
03:23:09,343 --> 03:23:17,847
LIAM: I know what to do-- Scanlan. This is your
moment. Shit on his face.

2580
03:23:17,847 --> 03:23:19,955
LAURA: No, that's disgusting!

2581
03:23:19,955 --> 03:23:22,813
SAM: Listen, that's not just something I can do
whenever.

2582
03:23:22,813 --> 03:23:24,193
LIAM: Who are you kidding?

2583
03:23:24,193 --> 03:23:30,501
SAM: I have to be in the mood, I need music, some
nice lighting, I need to be wined and dined a bit.

2584
03:23:30,501 --> 03:23:33,125
LIAM: My sister's right. Do it on his chest.

2585
03:23:33,125 --> 03:23:41,291
MATT: At which point, you pop the mask off, and
from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers

2586
03:23:41,291 --> 03:23:42,565
the face--

2587
03:23:42,565 --> 03:23:43,787
SAM: This is the Broker?

2588
03:23:43,787 --> 03:23:45,116
LAURA: This is the masked guy.

2589
03:23:45,116 --> 03:23:51,685
MATT: You can the face beneath. It's humanoid, but
right as you get past the nose and the mouth area,

2590
03:23:51,685 --> 03:24:00,443
it's all melted, like a horrible acid burn.
There's severe damage to the face. He looks at you

2591
03:24:00,443 --> 03:24:02,903
and goes "Kill me. It's all I have."

2592
03:24:02,903 --> 03:24:05,484
LAURA: Sorry, darling. You live.

2593
03:24:05,484 --> 03:24:09,792
MATT: (angry growl) And it's flexing and reaching
out at you but it can't quite get the range. It's

2594
03:24:09,792 --> 03:24:14,987
going to attempt to try to-- no it just cannot
break free of that (strained grunts). As you're

2595
03:24:14,987 --> 03:24:22,091
still concentrating on the spell, slowly the
Broker steps up, the eyes rolled back and white,

2596
03:24:22,091 --> 03:24:25,925
the giant wound in the chest, hobbles towards
you.

2597
03:24:25,925 --> 03:24:32,141
LIAM: It was almost my turn. Can I throw daggers
at him?

2598
03:24:32,141 --> 03:24:33,861
LAURA: No, she just reanimated him.

2599
03:24:33,861 --> 03:24:37,354
LIAM: You reanimated him? Oh then, never mind. I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

2600
03:24:37,354 --> 03:24:42,625
MATT: As you pull your blade out, she commands and
gives a hand motion, and the Broker hobbles

2601
03:24:42,625 --> 03:24:44,153
towards her.

2602
03:24:44,153 --> 03:24:52,962
KIT: My sisters, they sent you? They are still
hunting me?

2603
03:24:52,962 --> 03:25:00,693
MATT: You look down. The mark that was there on
your chest has vanished. Upon the point of the

2604
03:25:00,693 --> 03:25:05,984
Broker's death, whatever enchantment was placed
upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was

2605
03:25:05,984 --> 03:25:07,516
abolished.

2606
03:25:07,516 --> 03:25:22,562
KIT: Return to Palac Lusterka and present yourself
to my sisters. Let them see what good it will do

2607
03:25:22,562 --> 03:25:24,759
them to hunt me.

2608
03:25:24,759 --> 03:25:29,266
MATT: Turns around and starts shambling off.

2609
03:25:29,266 --> 03:25:33,681
ORION: Oh, wait a minute, hold on. And I as he's
walking away, I'm going to loot that dude. Take

2610
03:25:33,681 --> 03:25:37,633
shit off him. Come on. Hold on, let me take this.

2611
03:25:37,633 --> 03:25:43,526
MATT: There is a mostly ruined set of studded
leather armor that is enchanted, plus one. It's

2612
03:25:43,526 --> 03:25:49,007
basic, but it's need of serious repair as it
currently has a large gaping hole in the chest

2613
03:25:49,007 --> 03:26:01,690
area. And a shortsword. Plus-one Vicious
Shortsword. As Tiberius is pulling everything off

2614
03:26:01,690 --> 03:26:06,504
of the corpse as it's trying to shamble away into
the distance. Eventually, this half-naked ruined

2615
03:26:06,504 --> 03:26:09,675
body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the
night.

2616
03:26:09,675 --> 03:26:13,500
LAURA: What about the old lady? Do we get any loot
off her?

2617
03:26:13,500 --> 03:26:24,521
MATT: (laughs) The old lady has mostly a basic
wand. It's a plus-one wand.

2618
03:26:24,521 --> 03:26:28,134
LAURA: Here's a wand. I toss it back to them.

2619
03:26:28,134 --> 03:26:30,267
LIAM: Scanlan? Tibs? Who wants a wand?

2620
03:26:30,267 --> 03:26:33,921
SAM: I'll take it. All right.

2621
03:26:33,921 --> 03:26:35,685
MATT: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.

2622
03:26:35,685 --> 03:26:37,718
MARISHA: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.

2623
03:26:37,718 --> 03:26:41,413
MATT: A simple Ring of Protection.

2624
03:26:41,413 --> 03:26:44,777
LAURA: There's a ring. I take it, put it on. For
the time being.

2625
03:26:44,777 --> 03:26:54,188
MATT: And about roughly 320 gold. Amongst the two
of them. At this point in time, the other guy's

2626
03:26:54,188 --> 03:27:01,197
exhausted himself now, just still in place. You
see the Broker vanish into the shadows, heading

2627
03:27:01,197 --> 03:27:02,594
southward.

2628
03:27:02,594 --> 03:27:06,151
MARISHA: Shall we throw him in the pen with the
other guy?

2629
03:27:06,151 --> 03:27:11,894
ORION: Hold on a second, why would we keep this
one around to tell us now? What'd be the point? I

2630
03:27:11,894 --> 03:27:15,040
will kill this man unless you give me a good
reason not to.

2631
03:27:15,040 --> 03:27:23,278
KIT: I look at him and I ask, this? My sisters,
they are responsible for this?

2632
03:27:23,278 --> 03:27:40,176
MATT: He gives you a look for a second. "I've been
this my whole life. They gave me purpose. I follow

2633
03:27:40,176 --> 03:27:46,001
"them, and you've hurt the Mistresses."

2634
03:27:46,001 --> 03:27:56,858
KIT: That is true. I did do something similar to
Bellenore's face. But they will not give you

2635
03:27:56,858 --> 03:28:07,474
purpose. You are better out of their shadow. Trust
me, I know. You should find better purpose for

2636
03:28:07,474 --> 03:28:13,404
yourself. Go. Be free. I doubt that they will
trouble you any more.

2637
03:28:13,404 --> 03:28:22,667
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

2638
03:28:22,667 --> 03:28:30,284
LIAM: Plus? Plus zero.

2639
03:28:30,284 --> 03:28:32,329
SAM: You still have my inspiration.

2640
03:28:32,329 --> 03:28:34,125
LAURA: Inspiration! Plus ten!

2641
03:28:34,125 --> 03:28:37,571
LIAM: (singing) Scanlan make you feel good.

2642
03:28:37,571 --> 03:28:39,633
KIT: 15?

2643
03:28:39,633 --> 03:28:53,832
MATT: 15. The tension in the muscles eventually
relaxes, and the head hangs. "I know not for what

2644
03:28:53,832 --> 03:28:55,633
"reason I live."

2645
03:28:55,633 --> 03:29:06,285
KIT: You seem a capable fighter, yes? My cousin
recently became member of the Slayer's Take in

2646
03:29:06,285 --> 03:29:13,212
Vasselheim. Perhaps you would care to go find
purpose in testing your skills there?

2647
03:29:13,212 --> 03:29:15,936
LAURA: And if not there you can always fight in
the Crucible.

2648
03:29:15,936 --> 03:29:17,832
MATT: (grunts)

2649
03:29:17,832 --> 03:29:21,652
KIT: They look for nothing but strength and
honor.

2650
03:29:21,652 --> 03:29:25,762
MATT: At which point there's a large cracking
sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg.

2651
03:29:25,762 --> 03:29:30,512
(grunts) Breaks the other leg free and stands
there now before you.

2652
03:29:30,512 --> 03:29:34,927
MARISHA: Your purpose in life is only what you
make of it.

2653
03:29:34,927 --> 03:29:40,284
SAM: You can do anything. You could be President
of the United States.

2654
03:29:40,284 --> 03:29:49,685
ORION: While this is going on, I'm writing on a
piece of scroll right now. Which I give to him.

2655
03:29:49,685 --> 03:29:54,984
MATT: "I will walk, and I will think. Perhaps I
will drown." And he turns and starts walking

2656
03:29:54,984 --> 03:29:58,366
towards the shoreline on the other side to the
west--

2657
03:29:58,366 --> 03:30:07,096
TALIESIN: Lillith, does this mean you are free
from those who are hunting you?

2658
03:30:07,096 --> 03:30:14,916
KIT: I'm very much afraid not. This is but one of
the attempts my sisters have made to find me.

2659
03:30:14,916 --> 03:30:19,418
However, I have no intention of returning to my
home.

2660
03:30:19,418 --> 03:30:23,106
MARISHA: And what was the name of your homeland
again? It sounded very exotic.

2661
03:30:23,106 --> 03:30:34,889
KIT: Palac Lusterka is the seat of my family. We
go back very long way. But I would not recommend

2662
03:30:34,889 --> 03:30:40,330
that you visit there. It's not the most cheerful
place.

2663
03:30:40,330 --> 03:30:42,273
ORION: Not tourist-friendly?

2664
03:30:42,273 --> 03:30:46,850
KIT: Not particularly welcome, no.

2665
03:30:46,850 --> 03:30:54,388
LAURA: I've heard some terrible things about--
what is it, your father, is it? Or is it your

2666
03:30:54,388 --> 03:30:56,083
uncle? Your uncle.

2667
03:30:56,083 --> 03:31:09,723
KIT: My family in general have interesting
attitudes towards affection, shall we say. My

2668
03:31:09,723 --> 03:31:17,328
sisters-- well, you see, I'm not particularly cut
out for making a good first impression. However,

2669
03:31:17,328 --> 03:31:24,970
my sisters did always tell me that what was inside
was most important. They did tell me this as they

2670
03:31:24,970 --> 03:31:33,033
were removing intestines to divine with them, so
perhaps maybe not usual meaning of this phrase,

2671
03:31:33,033 --> 03:31:43,798
but Zahra is perhaps the member of my family that
I like best.

2672
03:31:43,798 --> 03:31:45,559
LAURA: Understandably.

2673
03:31:45,559 --> 03:31:47,222
MARISHA: We all have those.

2674
03:31:47,222 --> 03:31:56,819
LIAM: All we care about is deeds. You've proven
yourself to great depth today.

2675
03:31:56,819 --> 03:32:07,727
KIT: I believe in this circumstance I pale to my
present company. I've heard many wonderful things

2676
03:32:07,727 --> 03:32:15,182
about you from Zahra, and I'm honored to not only
have met you, but also to have had your aid in

2677
03:32:15,182 --> 03:32:23,561
this matter. I'm profoundly grateful. If there is
ever any opportunity at which I can return the

2678
03:32:23,561 --> 03:32:31,158
favor, I am not useful for much, but perhaps a
little smoke and mirrors I can do.

2679
03:32:31,158 --> 03:32:35,886
ORION: I would actually like to know how you keep
your horns so shiny and clean.

2680
03:32:35,886 --> 03:32:40,914
MATT: The cold wind picks up as the night air
begins to darken, a distant storm blowing over the

2681
03:32:40,914 --> 03:32:47,289
horizon to the northeast. The time draws late and
cold.

2682
03:32:47,289 --> 03:32:50,877
MARISHA: Lillith, would you like to stay the night
before you move on?

2683
03:32:50,877 --> 03:32:54,390
KIT: If I would not put you at any--

2684
03:32:54,390 --> 03:32:55,787
LAURA: Not even a little.

2685
03:32:55,787 --> 03:32:57,388
MARISHA: Please, have dinner with us.

2686
03:32:57,388 --> 03:32:58,957
KIT: Then it would be my pleasure.

2687
03:32:58,957 --> 03:33:00,811
LAURA: And we head back to the keep.

2688
03:33:00,811 --> 03:33:09,155
MARISHA: And I go in the back into the garden, and
I take the glissfoil out of my pocket that I was

2689
03:33:09,155 --> 03:33:14,316
given, and I revive it from its dried state that
it was given to me in,

2690
03:33:14,316 --> 03:33:16,140
and plant it in the ground.

2691
03:33:16,140 --> 03:33:17,014
MATT: All right.

2692
03:33:17,014 --> 03:33:26,669
LIAM: And as the twins are walking I say, clearly,
I'm eating shit here today. I guess I'm going to

2693
03:33:26,669 --> 03:33:29,771
make a promise not to stray from your side.

2694
03:33:29,771 --> 03:33:32,188
LAURA: Remember that promise.

2695
03:33:32,188 --> 03:33:33,882
LIAM: I promise.

2696
03:33:33,882 --> 03:33:36,877
SAM: I lick Tiberius.

2697
03:33:36,877 --> 03:33:39,182
(laughter)

2698
03:33:39,182 --> 03:33:41,738
ORION: That's what that feels like.

2699
03:33:41,738 --> 03:33:44,530
MATT: That will be our freeze-frame credit
high-five for the evening.

2700
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:49,366
TRAVIS: Nice job, Kit!

2701
03:33:49,366 --> 03:33:53,075
(cheering)

2702
03:33:53,075 --> 03:33:56,840
MATT: Thank you so much, Kit, for guesting with us
this evening, and for coming out and visiting us.

2703
03:33:56,840 --> 03:34:02,006
KIT: Thank you so much for having me. We've had an
absolutely amazing week and-- oh, it's really nice

2704
03:34:02,006 --> 03:34:04,249
to speak in my own accent again.

2705
03:34:04,249 --> 03:34:06,712
TALIESIN: Your accent good. We enjoy.

2706
03:34:06,712 --> 03:34:15,325
KIT: Thank you. No, it's been absolutely amazing.
It really has been an honor and you will

2707
03:34:15,325 --> 03:34:23,281
definitely be seeing me again in LA, because this
was wonderful. Thank you so much.

2708
03:34:23,281 --> 03:34:25,107
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2709
03:34:25,107 --> 03:34:26,918
LAURA: And everybody check her out on twitter.

2710
03:34:26,918 --> 03:34:28,382
MARISHA: What's your twitter?

2711
03:34:28,382 --> 03:34:34,989
KIT: My twitter is AnemoneTea dot-- not even dot
com, just AnemoneTea. It's that simple.

2712
03:34:34,989 --> 03:34:42,528
MATT: Travis and Laura have to run to catch a
plane flight. You guys go, rock it out, safe

2713
03:34:42,528 --> 03:34:46,052
flight. You guys are off to...?

2714
03:34:46,052 --> 03:34:52,062
LAURA: A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow.

2715
03:34:52,062 --> 03:34:57,763
(cheering)

2716
03:34:57,763 --> 03:34:59,227
TRAVIS: But we got to go.

2717
03:34:59,227 --> 03:35:02,319
MATT: Go. Travel safe. Bye, guys.

2718
03:35:02,319 --> 03:35:03,897
LAURA: I love you guys.

2719
03:35:03,897 --> 03:35:12,777
LIAM: Can I hold your mug? I want to see what it
feels like. Wow! Look at the size of that.

2720
03:35:12,777 --> 03:35:15,044
SAM: It's still got some booze in there, if you
want to take a slurp.

2721
03:35:15,044 --> 03:35:16,647
LIAM: Yes.

2722
03:35:16,647 --> 03:35:24,860
MATT: All right. As a note, just so you guys are
aware, we had a contest yesterday about 5:30 in

2723
03:35:24,860 --> 03:35:28,253
the afternoon during one of the streams. We had
everyone who was currently present in the chat room

2724
03:35:28,253 --> 03:35:37,653
be part of this random drawing, and the winner was
a David Kingsbury, who won the opportunity to

2725
03:35:37,653 --> 03:35:46,203
provide the name and essence of an NPC in our
campaign. The Broker is actually their

2726
03:35:46,203 --> 03:35:47,947
construction.

2727
03:35:47,947 --> 03:35:49,820
KIT: That's amazing!

2728
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:51,959
MATT: The Broker was designed by one of our
viewers, one of our Critters.

2729
03:35:51,959 --> 03:35:53,389
TALIESIN: Thank you for the target practice.

2730
03:35:53,389 --> 03:35:54,896
KIT: Thank you so much!

2731
03:35:54,896 --> 03:35:56,779
MARISHA: That is so cool.

2732
03:35:56,779 --> 03:35:57,992
KIT: That's amazing.

2733
03:35:57,992 --> 03:36:02,200
MATT: We're hoping to do stuff like that every now
and then in the future to bring in some Critters

2734
03:36:02,200 --> 03:36:07,781
to throw their creative mind in here and
incorporate a character into our world. My heart's

2735
03:36:07,781 --> 03:36:15,004
been going a mile a minute that entire game,
because no DM wants to have to kill a player.

2736
03:36:15,004 --> 03:36:17,459
MARISHA: I was on the verge of bawling my eyes
out.

2737
03:36:17,459 --> 03:36:24,755
LIAM: If I ever died, I thought-- and I still
think I'll probably be the first-- but if I ever

2738
03:36:24,755 --> 03:36:28,032
died, I thought it would be more like a bus
accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be

2739
03:36:28,032 --> 03:36:33,191
it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and
say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the

2740
03:36:33,191 --> 03:36:36,448
whole week I've been sweating.

2741
03:36:36,448 --> 03:36:41,114
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty harsh. The internet was
very vocal.

2742
03:36:41,114 --> 03:36:44,609
LIAM: Yeah, thanks guys, for putting the pressure
on.

2743
03:36:44,609 --> 03:36:49,378
MATT: Oh man. Well, that was awesome.

2744
03:36:49,378 --> 03:47:11,644
