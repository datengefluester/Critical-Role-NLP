1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
MATT: Welcome, everybody, to Critical Role! Our
Thursday night show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,724
voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and roll
dice and all that fun stuff in between! So for all

3
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:13,723
you new folks, welcome to our chaos. For all you
old folks, thanks and welcome back. We have a

4
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,693
number of announcements to get through. I'll try
and cruise through them as fast as humanly

5
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:23,055
possible. Pardon my phone as a reminder. Google
docs are a delightful thing. Starting off, I

6
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:30,759
wanted to direct all you Critters to our official
Twitter, @CriticalRole, for official news and

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,833
announcements. You're welcome to still tweet at us
for individual cast fun but we do have our

8
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:41,186
official source for all official announcements,
times, and our appearances. That would be the one

9
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:45,452
to pay attention to. Go to @CriticalRole, follow
it and any important stuff that comes in the

10
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:52,071
future will be available via that Twitter.
Awesome. Next up this weekend we're all going to

11
00:00:52,071 --> 00:01:00,317
be at New York Comic Con, which is going to be
awesome. We have a two hour block from noon to

12
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:04,453
2:00 PM Saturday, October 12th. Where is it at?
What's the room?

13
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:13,730
LIAM: It's a weird word, the Winga Stage?

14
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:25,179
MATT: It's not on the Google Doc. Curse you,
Google doc! But Saturday from noon to 2:00 PM, and

15
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:29,234
then on Sunday, for those who can't make the
actual convention, we're having an off-site

16
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:35,134
gathering of Critters at the wonderful and
illustrious comic book store Forbidden Planet.

17
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:41,781
That will be from 2:30 to 4:30. Our time block
shifted a little later in the day. 2:30 to 4:30,

18
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,468
Forbidden Planet, we'll be there. We'll be signing
autographs, meeting you guys, chatting it up, and

19
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:54,802
we'll be debuting our brand new awesome poster
here, exclusively for the New York Comic Con. Our

20
00:01:54,802 --> 00:02:01,230
Critical Role poster! We're super excited about
it. This was wonderfully designed by one of our

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:14,387
fellow Critters Joma Cueto. Joma did the art and
Kim Davis did the actual layout and design. Both

22
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:17,965
did an amazing job. We're going to have a bunch of
these available. We'll be signing them for you

23
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,263
guys, and we'll hope to see you there.

24
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,685
LIAM: I love it.

25
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:25,631
TRAVIS: They are pretty sexy.

26
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:31,326
LIAM: We're going to be on the Wikia stage.

27
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:37,968
MATT: The Wikia stage on Saturday, near hall 1A,
the Wikia stage at noon to 2:00 PM. Come find us

28
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:50,914
on Saturday, we're going to be there. Also, a ton
of mail was recently received just after Critmas.

29
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:59,811
If your gifts weren't seen this last Critmas,
they're probably in this batch. So next Critmas is

30
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:05,289
probably going to be a long haul. It's going to be
a doozy! But we're excited about that. That'll be

31
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:12,766
the first Thursday of November, so look forward to
that happening then. Next update. If you haven't

32
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:16,906
been paying attention, we've been having
occasional interviews once a week of our cast

33
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,982
going up on Geek and Sundry's website. Today we
had Travis's go up and if you haven't checked them

34
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:26,519
out you should. It's a little step into our
mindset, our crazy history and background of how

35
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,918
this whole thing got started. Silly things ensue.
So go read them if you have the chance, if you

36
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:38,167
haven't yet. Or wait until after the show. Also,
as of today we now have in the Geek and Sundry

37
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,060
store Critical Role key chains and necklaces.

38
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,921
LAURA: They look so cool.

39
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:51,523
MATT: Pretty rad. I'm really excited. They're
metal and awesome. They're of our logo and if you

40
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:56,814
feel like being as nerdy as we are and want to
adorn your key chains with them, they are there

41
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:58,523
available for your purchase.

42
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:04,311
LAURA: They're custom order, so they make them
when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get

43
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,292
them once you order them, but it's worth it.

44
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:11,327
LIAM: They have to come all the way from
Kraghammer.

45
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:18,525
MATT: Mithril's hard to sculpt properly. Takes a
while. Couple of other things, LARP: the Series,

46
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:23,779
one of the live action series here in Geek and
Sundry. Season two just premiered today. It's a

47
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,627
really cool series that both has moments of drama
and comedy that plays into the whole world and

48
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:35,537
lifestyle of the LARPing game systems and the people.
It's a really cool series. Check it out if that's

49
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:45,303
your kind of bag. It's good stuff, really funny.
Next Monday starts a new show called TPK Monday

50
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:52,216
Nights, where our illustrious Ivan, who hosts many
wonderful things here, will be running for the

51
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:58,860
rest of October a group of other individuals
through the RPG Outbreak Undead, which is actually

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:06,567
a really cool RPG that Ivan actually designed and was
in the whole process for, so it's Monday nights,

53
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,762
check that out the rest of October! To keep the
Halloween theme, we will probably be getting dead

54
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:14,395
repeatedly at the hands of Ivan, so look forward
to that.

55
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:22,450
This is the last week you can buy the
#NoShaveTil10k shirts. We have people who are

56
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,892
keeping it up. I had to shave for Vin Diesel, but
the rest of the month is straight on this now,

57
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:33,112
largely for my Halloween costume and for this
wonderful event. 20% of all proceeds from those

58
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:37,855
shirts goes to the Extra Life charity we've been
supporting, it helps out good people.

59
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:43,718
ZAC: I drew that shirt, by the way. I had to look
at his face for 12 hours.

60
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,772
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

61
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:51,110
ZAC: We've already hit 9,100. Protocol95, you are
the first winner of the night!

62
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,718
MATT: Protocol95, congratulations. You will be
winning the first bundle. Every 100 subscribers

63
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:02,868
there will be another giveaway within the chat
room. You have to be active in the chat to be up

64
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:09,325
for it. It includes a cast photo signed by the
cast of Critical Role, possibly signed while he's

65
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:16,219
wearing that awesome beard. And a wonderful piece
of art from our main artist Kit Buss, also signed

66
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,696
by the cast of Critical Role. So every 100
subscribers, that giveaway goes out in the

67
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:26,418
chatroom. Be active and bring your friends on to
subscribe so you can win one. Last thing I want to

68
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,860
mention, this has been a question that's come up
quite a bit, some people are definitely eager to

69
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,122
hear the information, so I had the pleasure on
Monday this week of designing and running a very

70
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,050
quick game of Dungeons and Dragons for Vin
Diesel.

71
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,509
LIAM: What? (laughs)

72
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,421
MATT: Let's just cross that bucket list item off
immediately. That was ridiculous. So it was a lot

73
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:50,802
of fun. He was fantastic, super awesome, genuine,
and was really excited--

74
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:54,236
LAURA: He rolled this die. It's sacred.

75
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:57,782
TALIESIN: It was literally bucket list! That was
one of the things we discussed when this game started;

76
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:00,781
it could lead to a game with Vin Diesel.

77
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:06,052
MARISHA: I bet if you go back and look at the Q
and A session we had, someone asked our dream game

78
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,294
crew--

79
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,647
MATT: Vin Diesel was one of our bucket list
players. So we've already knocked one off on the

80
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:12,896
show.

81
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,496
TALIESIN: It's like a group mass suicide at this
point.

82
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,729
MATT: Get matching tennis shoes, and it'll be
great.

83
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,405
LIAM: You didn't seem that excited, though.

84
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:24,644
ZAC: We can already announce that next Thursday at
the midpoint--

85
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:31,219
MATT: Next Thursday at the midpoint of next week's
Critical Role, we are going to show a mostly

86
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:37,834
complete video of that game. The full one will be
released shortly thereafter, but next week, on

87
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,597
Critical Role during the midpoint, we're going to
show you the majority of that game session with

88
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,719
him. Don't miss that.

89
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,564
ORION: Can I get a teaser? What did he smell
like?

90
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:52,585
LIAM: Iron.

91
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,264
TRAVIS: Quarry.

92
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:55,600
LAURA: Muscle.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,878
TALIESIN: Antifreeze and lilac.

94
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:11,809
MATT: All of those answers at once. A majestic
scent. It was delightful. We'll have interviews

95
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:16,935
going up throughout the week, exclusively next
week here on Thursday you'll be seeing most of

96
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:21,352
that game here and then more stuff's coming out
for the week thereafter. Really excited about

97
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:26,153
that, and I custom-made a witchhunter class for
him that I tailored for that level, and there's

98
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:29,261
been such a wide response for everyone asking
about the class that I've now spent a lot of my

99
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:34,562
free time that I'm not preparing for this game now
customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all

100
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:39,226
of you to partake in. So that'll be fun and
probably coming out sometime next week. It'll

101
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:43,298
probably be broken. You're welcome to homebrew my
homebrew, I'm not perfect, but it should be fun

102
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:48,473
and a cool guide for some people to give it a shot
as a player class, so look forward to that. Liam,

103
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,138
you got a couple things to announce?

104
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:54,822
LIAM: Yeah, just two things. I wanted to thank
every Critter who helped out with Joe Madureira's

105
00:08:54,822 --> 00:09:00,718
Kickstarter with Airship Syndicate's Kickstarter
for Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They crushed it.

106
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:05,582
They got to almost every rung of their ladder.
Maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight.

107
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:12,035
But Joe told me that they saw a little bit of a
bump every Thursday, and that our roleplaying

108
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:15,224
power had some effect, so thank you guys, thank
you very much.

109
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:18,010
TRAVIS: Because we are many.

110
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,451
MATT: We are legion.

111
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:23,196
LIAM: The other thing is tomorrow is Sam Riegel's
birthday.

112
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,171
TRAVIS: Nipples, is it really?

113
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:32,498
LIAM: I have a birthday present for him tonight.
Something I commissioned the lovely Kit Buss to

114
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,606
make for you.

115
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,327
SAM: What? It's Vaxmas?

116
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,602
LIAM: It's Vaxmas. Here it is. I'm going to send
it across and then I'll tweet it out. You guys can

117
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,598
look, but I made this just for you.

118
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,135
SAM: I'm not looking.

119
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,734
MARISHA: I made this just for you.

120
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:54,093
SAM: Oh wow, that's really nice! I thought it was
going to be vulgar. Wow. That's so sweet.

121
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,058
TRAVIS: Kit Buss, why are you the best?

122
00:09:56,058 --> 00:10:03,107
SAM: Thank you, Kit Buss. Me and two ladies, what
could be better? Right?

123
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,589
TRAVIS: I guess three ladies.

124
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:12,193
SAM: I don't know how to put this up, but thank
you. That's so sweet. Aw. I won't kill you

125
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,190
tonight.

126
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,712
ORION: Fun fact: Sam shares a birthday with my
mom. That's why I'll never forget your birthday,

127
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:20,969
ever.

128
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,557
SAM: And John Lennon.

129
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,719
MARISHA: Happy birthday, Orion's mom.

130
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,632
LAURA: Yeah. Happy birthday, Sam.

131
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:31,013
MATT: Happy unbirthday to Sam's mom, who is also a
Critter. You should go follow her on Twitter.

132
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,058
MARISHA: Momlan.

133
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,061
LIAM: She's not effing around, either.

134
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:44,265
MATT: Any other announcements? Or shall we dive
in?

135
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:50,220
LAURA: I have one. I got nominated for a Golden
Joystick award.

136
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,441
MATT: Really?

137
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,516
LAURA: Yeah, for Fiona in Tales from the
Borderlands.

138
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:54,652
MATT: That's awesome!

139
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,532
(cheering)

140
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,411
SAM: Hey Travis, you didn't know this?

141
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:07,755
LAURA: I didn't tell him. I think there's a week
left of voting, so you can go and help out.

142
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,139
ORION: They can vote for you?

143
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,232
LAURA: Yes, they can vote for me.

144
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,759
SAM: Can they vote many times?

145
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,734
LAURA: I think you have to register your email
address, so I don't know how many times you can

146
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:21,041
vote, but you have to vote in all the categories
in order to vote for the one category.

147
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:25,979
TRAVIS: Congratulations, Laura.

148
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,752
LAURA: Thanks, baby!

149
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:30,138
MARISHA: As Orion says, release the Critters.

150
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:38,567
MATT: That's awesome. Go show your support for
Fiona, and awesome! Let's go ahead and bring the

151
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:43,417
mood back to our realm of imagination and fantasy
and be back here in just a minute with the

152
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:47,003
beginning of this night's Critical Role.

153
00:11:47,003 --> 00:12:54,183
[dramatic music]

154
00:12:54,359 --> 00:13:01,519
MATT: So to get you guys caught up on what
happened recently, the group, having heard that

155
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,764
the Briarwoods, a couple who had taken power in
the town of Whitestone far to the northeast,

156
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:17,522
apparently responsible for the destruction of
Percy's entire family and his escape into the

157
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:24,503
wilds of Tal'Dorei, were going to be coming to
Emon to bridge a political handshake with

158
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:31,321
Sovereign Uriel and all of Tal'Dorei proper to
build a bridge across the channel that separates

159
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:35,437
this continent from Wildemount across the sea.

160
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:45,400
Upon hearing this, the party was planning to
gather information, and in doing so Vax got

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,184
himself caught by sneaking into their bedroom and
was nearly killed in the process. The group

162
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:58,552
managed to aid him, pull him out from the jaws of
death, and the Briarwoods escaped through arcane

163
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:07,394
means, leaving a shattered carriage, a mostly
beaten driver of their carriage. Through the

164
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:14,385
scuffle, a number of guards were hurt or killed,
and the party, upon meeting an individual named

165
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:20,879
Lilith, a tiefling, leading her back to the Keep,
they were attacked, or seemingly attacked, by a

166
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:28,074
series of bounty hunters that were after her.
There was some intense violence displayed against

167
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:32,787
a few of them, and this all got back to the
Council. The Council called Vox Machina to the

168
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:41,844
central palace and began a trial to see if they
were responsible for attacking guests of the

169
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:50,368
Council, ruining what could've been a very
lucrative union between the two towns and possibly

170
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:58,768
murdering an old woman. They had their membership
revoked, and during this sequence, apparently the

171
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:05,362
charmed Seeker Asum was restored, seemingly to
little effect.

172
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:11,746
The group then left, realizing that perhaps the
moral ramifications of their actions are having a

173
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:16,986
bigger impact due to their visibility and their
heroic status in the kingdom at large. When they

174
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:20,458
returned to the keep, they found two
representatives of the northern farmers of Emon

175
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:26,041
that required aid; their livestock had been stolen
over the past few weeks and was putting them in

176
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:31,702
dire straits when it came to the necessary amount
of meat they had to raise. The group, trying to

177
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:37,460
turn their morality on its head, decided to aid,
waited out in the center of the cow pasture at

178
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:48,091
night, masquerading, through illusionary magic, as
cows themselves. The giant roc, a gargantuan bird,

179
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:56,097
swooped down and grabbed Cow-leth, Keyleth, here.
Swept her away. The rest of the party, Tiberius

180
00:15:56,097 --> 00:16:00,938
enabled to fly through arcane means, and thus we
had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the

181
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:07,555
roc, which then got turned into a cow, to crash
into a mountain. They chased it back to its perch

182
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:11,102
up in the Cliffside Mountains to the northwest of
Emon.

183
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,898
LIAM: Such an old trope in fantasy.

184
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:23,219
MATT: Isn't it, though? "Cow-mouflage." And
engaged a guardian of this roc, a gnome druid who

185
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:29,642
had been removed from society for quite some time.
After some rather roundabout and at some points

186
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:37,839
on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation, they managed
to convince him to instead take the bird and flee

187
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,437
across the Ozmit Sea, to the northwest, towards
Vasselheim, where it would be a much better

188
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:51,379
landscape for the creature to thrive and grow. After that,
the party is making their way back. Right around

189
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:59,996
the beginning of daybreak, towards the keep. So
that is where we left off. Percy.

190
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:05,955
TALIESIN: Yes? Hello.

191
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:20,380
MATT: Darkness. Cold, lonely darkness. A flicker
of light. It swells, bright, white, blinding, then

192
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:31,155
flashes of your family, screaming. Julius,
silenced by a bolt to the throat. Vesper, thrown

193
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:36,230
from a tower wall. Your younger brothers' lifeless
bodies tossed in a pile. The smell of death

194
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:43,102
filling your cell. Your father Frederick, a blade
jutting from his chest, slick with crimson. Your

195
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:48,440
mother, Johanna, burned with irons, screaming.
Cassandra, running towards you, calling your name

196
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:57,339
into the night, begging you to help. One, two,
three arrows. She falls. Darkness once more.

197
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:07,300
Darkness and red. Red of blood. Red of burning
fire. The sky is fire. The world burns with flame

198
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,529
and iron. The smoke rises from the cinders,
coalescing into a face, black as soot with eyes as

199
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:21,414
burning coals, and a wicked grin. It speaks with a
raspy, rumbling bass, like a slow-moving

200
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:33,843
landslide. "You hold your vengeance, Percival. You
made it. You only need to take it for yourself.

201
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:46,935
"Make the world right. My gift is yours, and your
gift shall bring justice. Our bargain stands eager

202
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,822
"to close."

203
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:55,718
You suddenly come to consciousness, gasping loudly
against the air. You feel the warmth of the forge

204
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,796
across the side of the workshop crawling across
your face. You are sitting at your workbench,

205
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:04,906
having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions
in mid-construction. As you look around, you can

206
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:11,505
see your leather gloves are still on, apron on,
blackened soot spread across your face, and a

207
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:16,646
series of things you were in mid-build on broken
before you on your workshop table.

208
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:27,210
TALISEN: (sighs) How long have I been here?

209
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:33,578
MATT: There's nobody in the room, and you have no
idea. You're underground in the workshop. You

210
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:37,146
haven't seen the sun probably for a good day and a
half.

211
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:40,122
ORION: It's a new day. I didn't waste it at all.

212
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:44,199
MATT: You have no idea quite how long you've been
down here, and you've been left alone for quite

213
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,970
some time.

214
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,885
TALISEN: I'm going to head upstairs.

215
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:57,805
MATT: You go and open the metallic door that leads
into your workshop and come around the corner, and

216
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:05,985
there's a chair set in the corner, where Jarett
would be sitting, one of the head guards at your

217
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:14,159
facility. Jarett, however, is standing, hands up
to his throat, going (choking sounds) with no

218
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,095
visible assailant.

219
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,064
TALIESIN: (shouting) Help!

220
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:22,287
SAM: Are we there? No, we're not even there.

221
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,955
MATT: I want you to go ahead and roll initiative.

222
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,034
SAM: Oh shit, it's already started!

223
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:30,072
LAURA: Trinket was down there.

224
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,408
SAM: Was?

225
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:35,557
LAURA: Don't say that!

226
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:38,714
SAM: Just saying that Trinket died already.

227
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:42,189
LAURA: Don't say it.

228
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:43,866
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 28.

229
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,070
(cheering)

230
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,274
MATT: And that's how Percy does it.

231
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,454
TRAVIS: What is with that dice and you, man?

232
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:57,667
LIAM: You are the yin to Wil Wheaton's yang.

233
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:04,840
TALIESIN: He was sitting here 20 minutes ago. I
rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the

234
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,000
building.

235
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,409
MARISHA: No, we have him. It's balance.

236
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:23,502
MATT: All right. So what's your total?

237
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:25,748
TALIESIN: 28.

238
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:40,361
MATT: 28. (laughs) You are definitely-- Okay. You
are up first. What do you want to do? As you come

239
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:44,518
around the corner and you see this visual in front
of you. If you want to go ahead and roll for

240
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:45,949
Trinket, too.

241
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:50,414
LAURA: (worried noises) Oh no!

242
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:53,041
TALIESIN: So I just see him up like this?

243
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,834
LAURA: 19.

244
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,444
MATT: 19? Nice.

245
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:03,105
TALIESIN: Just for some reference, does it look
like he's possessed, or does it look like he's

246
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,510
trying to remove something?

247
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,336
MATT: It looks like he's trying to remove
something from around his neck, and looking down,

248
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,810
you can see his feet are actually off the ground,
kicking. It looks like there's a little bit of air

249
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,333
wisping around behind him.

250
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,211
TALIESIN: How insane would it be to try and make a
shot beneath his legs?

251
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,142
MATT: You can certainly go for it and try.

252
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:27,020
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop down. Can I make an
aimed shot against something I can't see?

253
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,284
MATT: You can try, it'll be with disadvantage, but
you can definitely make it.

254
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:36,563
ORION: He's in the kitchen?

255
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,949
LAURA: No, he's downstairs.

256
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:43,175
SAM: Can I request that the rest of us do the
sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he

257
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:44,554
misses?

258
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,898
TALIESIN: Okay, I want 5.1; start here and make it
all the way down.

259
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:52,108
LAURA: But you're not going to miss, so it doesn't
matter.

260
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:56,012
TALIESIN: I'm going to take an aimed shot for my
first shot, and then start firing blindly.

261
00:22:56,012 --> 00:23:00,301
MATT: This will be disadvantage against an
invisible assailant.

262
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,439
TRAVIS: It misses?

263
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:08,478
TALIESIN: It missed. I'm just making sure I didn't
misfire. No, I didn't! Thank god.

264
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:10,991
MATT: So what's the total?

265
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:15,478
TALIESIN: 15.

266
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,899
MATT: Total of 15? Still hits.

267
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:35,884
TALIESIN: Still hits? 15 hits? Oh, that's 16
points of damage, and he has to make a

268
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:38,284
constitution saving throw to not be knocked
prone.

269
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,298
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on that?

270
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:55,752
TALIESIN: Where is my DC? DC of eight plus my
proficiency mod, plus my dexterity mod, so 19.

271
00:23:55,752 --> 00:24:02,701
MATT: Sure enough. You see all of a sudden the air
go (gasp) and Jaret falls to his knees (coughs).

272
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:06,218
TALIESIN: I'm going to take two more shots right
above his head.

273
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:07,863
MATT: Go for it.

274
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,209
SAM: Don't hit Jarett.

275
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,001
MATT: Jarett's on his knees, prone, essentially.

276
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,678
SAM: He could still hit Jarett! He's our best
guy.

277
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:15,640
MATT: You still have disadvantage on these.

278
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,630
TALIESIN: I don't?

279
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,993
MATT: No, you still have disadvantage on these. It
is still an invisible creature.

280
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,139
TALIESIN: 20.

281
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,781
MATT: 20 hits.

282
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:28,371
TALIESIN: That's 13.

283
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,442
MATT: 13 does not hit.

284
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:32,394
TALIESIN: No, 13 points of damage.

285
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:33,751
MATT: Oh. Yes.

286
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:40,046
TALIESIN: And then 20 again.

287
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,928
MATT: 20 hits.

288
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,495
TALIESIN: Nine points of damage.

289
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:49,117
MATT: Nine points of damage. (gunshots) The
gunshots are echoing through the hallway. Whatever

290
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:52,978
this weird entity is, you can see some of the
nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement,

291
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:58,869
you hear this (gasping sound), this angry sucking
sound in the air around you. Do you want to move,

292
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,867
or are you staying where you are?

293
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:08,963
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm
going to keep yelling. Help! I don't think I have

294
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:10,522
an earring.

295
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:18,350
MATT: You see some sort of shimmer of wind come
around the corner towards you. This one turns

296
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,969
around and (whooshing sound) over to the bars, and
you can see in the distance, it's moving over

297
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:26,113
towards where your captive currently is.

298
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:32,507
ORION: How far away are we from the keep?

299
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:37,873
MATT: I'm getting to that. At the end of this
combat round, all of you guys are right toward the

300
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:41,604
outskirts of the keep, and you hear the muffled
ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep.

301
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:43,278
ORION: We do hear that.

302
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,754
MATT: You do hear this as you're just getting to
the outer gates.

303
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:52,325
ORION: As soon as I hear that, I cast Fly on
myself and (whoosh).

304
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:55,199
LAURA: Are you wearing an earring, Percy?

305
00:25:55,199 --> 00:26:04,271
MATT: No, he is not. The entity swooshes down the
stairs and comes at you. That's going to be a 22.

306
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,575
TALIESIN: That hits.

307
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,992
MATT: And a 12.

308
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:09,522
TALIESIN: That does not.

309
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:16,916
MATT: It swings towards you, and a giant slam of
extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact

310
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:23,242
hits you in the torso, doing 15 points of
bludgeoning damage. The other one swings out, same

311
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:26,575
direction. This time you actually pull off to the
side and knock it out of the way with your

312
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:36,619
Pepperbox. The one back there is going to attempt
to grapple. Succeeds. That's its action, and you

313
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:46,739
can see the driver that you had put into prison is
currently being (choking) making strangling sounds

314
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,442
in the distance. That ends it. Trinket's up.

315
00:26:50,442 --> 00:27:00,179
LAURA: Trinket. He can see Percy getting attacked
and instinct takes over, and he runs forward and

316
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,929
he claws him.

317
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:05,391
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the
attack.

318
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:12,194
LAURA: That does not hit. That's a natural 20.

319
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:15,914
MATT: That will hit! (laughs) It begins.

320
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:22,705
LAURA: Oh, that's the wrong thing. That's a 2d4.

321
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:28,630
MATT: So roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two.

322
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,179
LAURA: 17 damage.

323
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:39,796
MATT: 17 damage, nice. Trinket runs up, coming out
of his somewhat sleepy stupor, goes for a bite

324
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:43,645
attack and grabs nothing with it, and turns around
and rakes a claw backwards, manages to get the

325
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:48,927
back of whatever this entity is, and you hear it
scream (gasping scream). You do, at least.

326
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:53,050
TALIESIN: I have a technical dispute, really
quickly. Could the wraith have gotten that far,

327
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,946
since I knocked him prone?

328
00:27:54,946 --> 00:28:00,806
MATT: Yes, it could've, because it uses half its
movement speed to get up.

329
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,187
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. Never mind.

330
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:03,643
MATT: Its movement is actually 50.

331
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:05,560
TALIESIN: Ignore me! 50?!

332
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,398
MATT: Not that you know that. But it moved far for
what you think it should've been able to.

333
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,264
ORION: By the way, for the record, Matthew, I have
no idea what we're fighting.

334
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,086
TRAVIS: Nobody does.

335
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,648
ORION: I'm just saying, I haven't meta-gamed
here.

336
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:22,186
MATT: Congrats. (laughs) I'm proud of you.

337
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:24,140
LIAM: Fresh start.

338
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:36,573
MATT: Jarett then gets up, sees this happening,
moves over, and pulls out the key to try and open

339
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:42,177
the prison door. Spends the turn doing so. Manages
to get the door open. That's the end of Jarett's

340
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:47,144
turn. Okay, now, the rest of you guys roll
initiative.

341
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:53,046
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on, you giant ball-bearing.
Damn.

342
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:56,874
LAURA: Does that count, if I hit it into my box
and it slammed into the side? Does that count, or

343
00:28:56,874 --> 00:28:58,886
should I let it roll naturally?

344
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:07,442
MATT: Let it roll naturally. That would normally
count, but it's fine. Wherever it lands, you take

345
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:11,501
it, going forward. Okay, so 25 to 20?

346
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,646
SAM: Oh, initiative?

347
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:17,673
TALIESIN: Keep up, people! Come on.

348
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,974
MATT: You hear the gunshot. You're entering this
intensity.

349
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:25,640
SAM: I don't think it's anything. I think it's
just him tinkering.

350
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:36,343
MATT: So Scanlan stays behind. 25 to 20? 20 to 15?
What are your scores?

351
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,821
LIAM and ORION: 15.

352
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:39,483
LAURA: 17.

353
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:41,578
MARISHA and TRAVIS: 16.

354
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:45,475
TALIESIN: Thank you all, by the way, for leaving a
bear on suicide watch. That was really cool.

355
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:47,108
LAURA: You're welcome.

356
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:56,070
MATT: Vex, what'd you get again?

357
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,666
TRAVIS: 17.

358
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,429
LAURA: I got 17.

359
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,039
SAM: He got 15.

360
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,998
MATT: 15, Tiberius. And what'd you get, Vax?

361
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:07,094
LIAM: 15.

362
00:30:07,094 --> 00:30:10,113
MATT: 15, all right. Three 15s.

363
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:12,460
SAM: I got three.

364
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:22,210
MATT: You got three? Okay. All right, so you guys
all spend your turn, if you choose to, to rush

365
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:27,384
through the gates. As soon as the gunshots go off,
you can see Shayne's up on top, and she sees it,

366
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:32,682
gives a quick turn, and you can see the gates
begin to open, and you hear this angry grunting as

367
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:36,595
your half-orc guard is now pulling the doors open
as fast as he can. You guys find a moment and slip

368
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:40,668
through, running towards the front of the keep.
You guys manage to get, with full dash and full

369
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:43,875
turn, including your flight-- because you fly a
little bit faster, but you have a little more of

370
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,334
an arc to get over-- you guys get to the front of
the keep this turn. So you won't get into this

371
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:51,882
until next round. That brings it back to the top.
Percy, you're up.

372
00:30:51,882 --> 00:31:05,104
TALIESIN: (sighs) There's no way I can fire at the
one who's far away from me right now, is there?

373
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,623
MATT: It's hard to see.

374
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,409
LAURA: But Jarett's got him.

375
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,958
TALIESIN: I can ignore cover, though.

376
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:15,286
MATT: You can ignore cover, but you have this
entity in front of you. I mean, you'll be at

377
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:18,681
disadvantage regardless, because you're shooting
at something invisible, and you have something

378
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,983
that's in melee of you and you have a ranged
weapon.

379
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:26,448
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if there's a charge
left in my glove and try and take the-- there

380
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,947
wouldn't be a charge left in my glove, would
there?

381
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:31,983
MATT: You glance down at the glove, and you see
the gemstone in the center of the palm is

382
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:34,452
currently dark and lifeless.

383
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:41,587
TALIESIN: Okay. (sighs) Hold on, sorry.

384
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:43,965
TRAVIS: Fan the hammer, motherfuck.

385
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:58,348
TALIESIN: It gets weird when it's up close. Okay.
Let's see what we do. All right. There's no way I

386
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,448
can step back right now, is there?

387
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:03,493
MATT: Currently? I mean, you can if you want to.
It'll get a free strike on you.

388
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:05,553
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take shots,
then.

389
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:11,241
MATT: The one in front of you? Okay. Go for it.
With disadvantage on each shot.

390
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:16,794
TALIESIN: Firing with disadvantage? Screw it, I'm
going to take my first one with sharpshooter to

391
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:24,187
see if I can do any damage that way. Nope.
Actually, that's a misfire.

392
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:27,711
MATT: So Pepperbox (explosion sound). You go to
shoot, and--

393
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:32,395
MARISHA: (ricochet sound)

394
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:38,488
MATT: The barrel gets clogged, and the front of it
actually catches fire for a second, and you have

395
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:43,120
to shake it out right now. It's completely offset,
and it's going to take a moment to even get it to

396
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,105
where you can fire again.

397
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:50,783
TALIESIN: Okay. Do I have six seconds?

398
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:54,158
MATT: You do. And you've used one attack. You have
two more attacks.

399
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:57,524
TALIESIN: Well, it misfired.

400
00:32:57,524 --> 00:33:00,590
MATT: Yeah, that weapon you have to use an action
to repair.

401
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,905
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to do something a little
weird. I'm going to pull out Bad News. I know I

402
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:10,663
can't shoot this close with it, or god only knows
what would happen. I'm going to try and swing it

403
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:14,663
like a pugil stick, and I'm going to try and hit
him with the butt of Bad News.

404
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:20,102
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a melee attack. This
is strength-based. Add your proficiency modifier

405
00:33:20,102 --> 00:33:22,128
and your strength modifier.

406
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:24,388
TALIESIN: 15?

407
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:28,459
MATT: You still have disadvantage on it because
you can't see it. And you're not proficient.

408
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,596
TALIESIN: 15?

409
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:31,436
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

410
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,317
(cheering)

411
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:45,524
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll-- with the
size of Bad News, I'd say 1d6, plus your strength

412
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,589
modifier.

413
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:47,894
TALIESIN: Four.

414
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:52,598
MATT: Okay, so four points of damage, as you
bludgeon it. You took a turn to get it out. Your

415
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:57,436
third attack is then slamming it in the side.
Whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against

416
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,985
the wall. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

417
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,539
TALIESIN: 14.

418
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:10,754
MATT: Okay. So the impact does not appear to
damage Bad News in this instance. It is a fragile

419
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:17,816
construct, and even doing melee attacks with it
does subject it to a misfire possibility.

420
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:20,648
TALIESIN: I hit it with the stock, I was careful.

421
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,454
MATT: I know. Okay, so that concludes your turn?

422
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,621
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm kind of-- yeah.

423
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:29,786
MATT: Okay, you stay there. All right. The one
that's in front of you now is going to go ahead

424
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:35,007
and go over this way. Trinket-- well, no, it's
still in melee, so it doesn't actually get an

425
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:40,259
attack. It does get two strikes on you. That is a
17.

426
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:41,436
TALIESIN: Nope.

427
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:43,393
MATT: And that is 18.

428
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:45,707
TALIESIN: Armor class is 18.

429
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:47,229
MATT: So it does just hit you.

430
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:48,984
TALIESIN: Can I do that crazy thing?

431
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:51,609
MATT: No, I've eliminated that.

432
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,603
TALIESIN: Oh, you've removed that. Okay, never
mind. I don't have the new update, sorry. I don't

433
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:57,256
have a dodge anymore, right?

434
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:04,121
MATT: No, the dodge is not there. It rarely came
into play. Okay, so that puts you at another 15

435
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:08,791
points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you
right across the head. Your eyes go dizzy for a

436
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:13,103
second, and you take a minute to refocus your
vision, and you can now see in the air, the

437
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:19,086
shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid
face stretched and ghastly going (gasps) in front

438
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:22,940
of you, but it's still barely even visible, and
only because of the proximity to you are you able

439
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,329
to actually make out any sort of shape or shimmer
in the air in front of you. The other one is

440
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:44,919
attempting to choke out the prisoner. However, the
prisoner resists through athletics, so he's

441
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:51,502
currently holding back at bay the strength of the
entity. That ends its turn. Trinket's up.

442
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:59,000
LAURA: Trinket's up! He's going to try to jump and
land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its

443
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,128
face. I don't know how to do that.

444
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:08,828
MATT: (laughs) To do a real leap, Trinket would
have to back up and then run towards it. If

445
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:14,672
Trinket wants to do that. Okay. So Trinket backs
up. As it does, it gets one free swipe at Trinket.

446
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,420
That is 18 to hit.

447
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:24,611
LAURA: I'm having an issue here. Because I have 18
in parentheses, and then I wrote a 20 and I

448
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:26,575
circled it and I don't know why.

449
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,101
MATT: I don't know why, either.

450
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,310
LAURA: 18 is probably--

451
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,423
MATT: Yeah, we'll say 18. So that hits. Trinket
takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the

452
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,885
entity swings out and backhands Trinket. However
Trinket now leaps-- go ahead and make an athletics

453
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,005
check.

454
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:39,972
LIAM: He has better armor class than I do.

455
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:42,030
SAM: Does he have armor?

456
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,374
LAURA: He does! He's got his bulette armor, man.
He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength?

457
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,892
MATT: Athletics, yeah.

458
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:50,696
LAURA: 17?

459
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:57,047
MATT: 17. Yeah. Trinket leaps forward, slamming
this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone,

460
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,059
and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack.

461
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:03,489
LAURA: Yes! That didn't count because it slipped
out of my hand. That was even worse than the other

462
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:10,061
one. So 11. It slipped out of my hand. It
shouldn't count if it goes like that! 20.

463
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:15,888
MATT: So Trinket manages to knock it prone,
however, because it gets pushed out of the way,

464
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:19,351
Trinket has a hard time, Trinket just makes a big
slash and a bite out in the air where it once was

465
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,969
and misses entirely.

466
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:23,307
LAURA: But he's gone prone.

467
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:30,154
MATT: But he is knocked prone. Jarett's now going
to attempt to grapple the entity.

468
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:32,105
SAM: Wait, Trinket missed? (ricochet sound)

469
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:35,644
(laughter)

470
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:39,075
MATT: Jarett manages to reach out and grab onto
whatever this creature is, hold onto it, just

471
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:45,159
grappling, and is going to attempt to try and pull
it back. For this, I will do a contested roll on

472
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:52,314
that. It rolled a one. Jarett pulled it back that
far, managing to let go of its quarry, and is

473
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:59,148
currently holding onto some sort of angry,
whirling entity at that point. That ends Jarett's

474
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:10,819
turn. The rest of you guys all manage to make your
way up into the armory up top. First is Vex. You

475
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:15,265
rush in there, and what do you want to do?

476
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,658
LAURA: I want to run down and shoot something.

477
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:22,603
MATT: Okay. You can get just about there.

478
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:26,110
LAURA: Can I see anything? Can I ricochet an arrow
to hit?

479
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:32,814
MATT: (laughs) I would say this guy has
three-quarters cover, so it would be disadvantage

480
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:39,321
on the attack. You already have disadvantage
because it's invisible, so it's hard to hit,

481
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,681
regardless.

482
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:47,060
LAURA: That was the same one each time. 28.

483
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,027
MATT: 28? 28 hits.

484
00:38:49,027 --> 00:39:05,061
LAURA: Oh, I didn't fucking Hunter's Mark him.
God damn it. Fuck. 15.

485
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:09,107
MATT: 15 points of damage. The first arrow sinks
into whatever's there, and you can see it jutting

486
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,817
out of no physical space.

487
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,468
LAURA: Now I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and I'm
going to hit him again. Can I do that?

488
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:16,469
MATT: Technically, it's part of your attack. You
can do two attacks first, then you can bonus

489
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:19,108
action, so you're like (arrow sounds) and then you
Hunter's Mark it after.

490
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:24,615
LAURA: All right. That one doesn't hit. Doesn't
matter. Doesn't hit anyway. I missed it.

491
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:25,978
SAM: (ricochet sound)

492
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:31,175
MATT: Second shot shatters against the back wall
of the stone. You can Hunter's Mark for your

493
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:32,310
bonus.

494
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,550
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him.

495
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:42,369
MATT: All right. Entity is now Hunter's Marked.
That ends Vex's turn. Keyleth, you now also make

496
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:44,131
your way into the doorway.

497
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,713
MARISHA: How far can I get?

498
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:52,239
MATT: About there. Nothing's in visual sight right
now, unfortunately.

499
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,799
MARISHA: Nothing's in visual sight?

500
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:58,692
MATT: No, half of that was getting to that point.
You could dash and try and make your way in, but

501
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,333
you wouldn't be able to do anything.

502
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,161
MARISHA: Can I dash and then make a bonus action?

503
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:12,049
MATT: You could, yeah. Your call. What do you got?
Grog, you're on deck.

504
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:14,350
MARISHA: I'll just wait.

505
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,470
MATT: Okay. Keyleth waits there. Grog, you're up.

506
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,264
MARISHA: Let me just scootch over so I can be
behind Vex.

507
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:28,998
MATT: You have a little better movement, so you
actually manage to get two more squares in. What's

508
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:30,379
your speed again?

509
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,339
TRAVIS: 50.

510
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,956
MATT: 50? Yeah, you manage to get up to there, and
now your turn begins.

511
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:41,628
TRAVIS: I go into a rage, and I come in, and I
turn to the right, and I run up as close as I can

512
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:42,973
to Jared--

513
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,239
LAURA: Jarett.

514
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,944
TRAVIS: Yeah, Jarett. And wispy fuck.

515
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:52,947
MATT: All right, so you charge in. Angry, you see
Jarett's currently reaching back and trying to go

516
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:56,924
for his crossbow now that this entity's in his
face. He's grappled it with one arm and he's

517
00:40:56,924 --> 00:41:00,966
reaching back to try and grab it. You come rushing
in. Go for it.

518
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:08,059
TRAVIS: I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag
of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a

519
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:10,267
swing at whatever he's holding.

520
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:16,330
MATT: All right. Cool. So as you pull out (glass
breaking) the pain from the glass even further

521
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,324
angers you in your rage. You can see a mix of holy
water and blood trickle down from your fist as you

522
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:25,021
clench it. Go ahead and swing for a punch with
disadvantage.

523
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:26,782
TRAVIS: That's a one.

524
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:32,899
MATT: So that first strike just whiffs over.
Through your anger, you're unable to focus on

525
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:34,334
where this entity may be.

526
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:39,914
TRAVIS: Not off to a good start with this. Number
two. Disadvantage. Fuck.

527
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,097
MATT: What's the total?

528
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:44,857
TRAVIS: 15.

529
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:47,756
MATT: 15 just barely hits. Go ahead and roll.

530
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,328
TRAVIS: One of these guys?

531
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:51,361
MATT: Go ahead and roll that. Half that damage,
yes.

532
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:55,717
TRAVIS: One. Plus rage, which is--

533
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:57,227
MATT: Plus strength.

534
00:41:57,227 --> 00:42:01,506
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Eight.

535
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:07,280
MATT: So eight points of damage to it. All righty.
(whack) It hits, and you hear this (yelps) sound

536
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,609
as it takes the impact, and you can see this
strange, angry face appear suddenly out of the

537
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:16,538
shimmering air that just then disperses again, and
you don't quite know where it is. You can make a

538
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:18,036
third strike now, if you want.

539
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,378
LAURA: Did it do any holy damage?

540
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:21,624
MATT: Did not appear to have any additional effect
on the entity.

541
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:27,572
TRAVIS: Well, hell, it was worth a shot. Oh, at
disadvantage. 19.

542
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:30,259
MATT: 19 still hits. Go ahead and roll the next
attack.

543
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,080
TRAVIS: Eight again.

544
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,655
MATT: Eight damage again. (whack) You backhand it
with your third strike, this time finding the edge

545
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:42,843
of its face again, and you see the chair right
next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch

546
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:48,943
itself and keep itself aloft. Nevertheless, this
strange invisible entity is still there holding

547
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,080
its ground.

548
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,656
TRAVIS: Would you say the blood from my hand is
splattering Jarett behind him?

549
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:56,118
MATT: You look over at Jarett. Jarett's currently
trying to grab onto the creature and keep it

550
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,736
grappled. So yeah, it's spattering on him.

551
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:00,273
TRAVIS: I'm a painter.

552
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:08,775
MATT: (laughs) All right, that ends Grog's turn.
Vax and Tiberius. You guys both get up to the edge

553
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:10,310
of this room here.

554
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,746
ORION: Your cape is looking really nice, Vax.

555
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:22,091
LIAM: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste, and I get
double movement, so I get to go 60 feet. I'm going

556
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:28,232
to slink up right beside Trinket and stab the shit
out of this invisible thing.

557
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:32,454
ORION: Stab him! Hey, what do they look like?

558
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:42,549
LIAM: So because Trinket's right there, this is a
sneak attack. That hits. That is 29 to hit.

559
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:47,606
MATT: That'll hit.

560
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:50,379
(laughter)

561
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:54,276
MATT: It is prone. It is invisible but it is
prone, so that evens out to no advantage or

562
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:55,969
disadvantage.

563
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:10,195
LIAM: (counting) 25 for the first hit.

564
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:12,498
MATT: 25, all right.

565
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:15,222
LAURA: Don't you double it? You had to double 19.

566
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:20,707
LIAM: No, he didn't-- that's a critical hit.

567
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:22,605
LAURA: Oh, right.

568
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:32,629
LIAM: One shy. So now out comes the Dagger of
Life-Stealing. It misses-- well, does 15 hit?

569
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,118
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

570
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:40,937
LIAM: Just barely hits? Oh, that's better than I
thought. That is three plus six is nine for

571
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:49,760
damage, and then the Keen Dagger comes back, and
that gets a 27, so that also hits for nine of

572
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,069
damage.

573
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:55,035
MATT: All right. So as you rush over, you stab
downward. You hear this (gurgle) sound as your

574
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:58,238
blade comes down into whatever entity's there, and
your hand moves around as it struggles against the

575
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:01,663
blade. You pull it out, grab your other dagger,
and then throw it in the air, catch it, slam it

576
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:04,190
down again for that third strike, and then pull
back and stab a third time.

577
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:10,496
LIAM: And Trinket is very comforting, pressed
against my shoulder as I do all that. He's

578
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:11,746
supple.

579
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:18,620
MATT: Supple bear. #SuppleBear. All right, that
ends your turn. Tiberius, what are you doing?

580
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,257
ORION: How far can I get?

581
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:27,561
MATT: That's about as far as you can get with your
movement. You currently do not have visual on

582
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:31,733
either of them. You're flying. What's your fly
speed?

583
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:33,760
ORION: 60 feet.

584
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,436
MATT: You said that last time, and we found out it
was 40, I believe wasn't it?

585
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:43,510
ORION: Was it 40? I thought it was 60. It was
double the-- shit, hold on. I have a card--

586
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,069
MATT: You have a card and yet I find it faster.

587
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:48,650
ORION: 60 feet.

588
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,819
MATT: It is 60. You're right. Yeah, so you can go
double. You are now just coasting down the

589
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,169
stairway.

590
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,912
ORION: I'm going to attempt something I haven't
actually tried before.

591
00:45:57,912 --> 00:45:59,323
MATT: All right, go for it.

592
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,410
ORION: Because there's one to my right and one to
my left, right?

593
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,745
MATT: Correct. There's one over here that has Grog
and Jarett flanking. The other one has Percy, Vax,

594
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:11,950
and Trinket all around it. That one's actually
prone on the ground. It's hard to see normally;

595
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,458
it's very hard to see now that it's swarmed.

596
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,921
ORION: Do I have visual of both wraiths?

597
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:21,092
MATT: You have visual of both entities, whatever
they are.

598
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:28,813
ORION: Okay, sorry. I call them wraiths. Okay, so.
I'm going to cast at--

599
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:31,372
SAM: Have we rested, by the way?

600
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,935
MATT: No, you have not rested yet.

601
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:36,321
SAM: So we're down a bunch of spells.

602
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:38,391
MATT: Yeah, you're still where you were when you
came back.

603
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:40,891
MARISHA: Well, to be fair, we talked. We didn't
have a battle.

604
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:45,340
SAM: Some of us used spells. Fly and stuff.

605
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,171
ORION: I'm going to try to do this about now. I'm
going to look to my right and my left and at

606
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:56,658
6th-level I'm going to try to do Glacial Blast and
split the damage and try to hit both of them.

607
00:46:56,658 --> 00:47:00,081
Because it does 8d8 damage--

608
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,009
MATT: Are you doing this single-stream?

609
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:08,392
ORION: I'm trying to split my arc. So instead of
doing this, I'm trying to-- (ice sounds)

610
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:13,465
MATT: Okay. How much damage is it?

611
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:15,955
ORION: At sixth level, it's 8d8 damage.

612
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:18,113
MATT: Okay, and what's the saving throw?

613
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:21,522
ORION: 17.

614
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:32,148
MATT: 17, okay. Jarett and Vax have to make saving
throws, as well. Go ahead and make that. Jarett

615
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:37,533
rolled an 18 and has high dex, so yeah, Jarett
makes his save. That's half-damage for Jarett.

616
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,150
LIAM: 28 for me.

617
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:46,832
MATT: All right. So you take no damage, because
you're a rogue. Go ahead and roll damage. That's

618
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:51,459
18 for one. This one fails, this one succeeds.

619
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:55,866
ORION: Cool. Right hand does-- oh, sweet.

620
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:59,357
MARISHA: No. That's a d10. These are d8s.

621
00:47:59,357 --> 00:48:02,673
ORION: Sorry, my bad.

622
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:05,868
MATT: It's actually not prone. They're immune to
being prone.

623
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:16,854
ORION: Right hand-- that's 14 to my right, and
then 18 to my left.

624
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:19,897
MATT: So how much is that?

625
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,092
ORION: So 14 to my right, 18 to my left.

626
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:25,190
MATT: Okay. Got you.

627
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:32,504
ORION: The one that doesn't save gets (freezing
sound).

628
00:48:32,504 --> 00:48:39,428
MATT: It would if it wasn't immune. However, as
you arc down, the ice blast comes through. You can

629
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:43,554
see Vax manages to pull down to the ground and get
out of the way in time. Jarett ducks out of the

630
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:47,529
way and it blasts over, hitting both these
entities. Ice crackles around both their forms,

631
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:59,495
but then the forms shift out of it. That ends your
turn right there. Comes back to Scanlan.

632
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:01,357
SAM: Oh, where am I?

633
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:04,015
MATT: You are right there. Just entered the room
behind everybody else.

634
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:08,318
SAM: Where does Percy do his tinkering?

635
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:09,716
MATT: Over here.

636
00:49:09,716 --> 00:49:12,055
SAM: Because I can't see what's going on down
there.

637
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:17,568
MATT: No, you just see, currently, these three
down the hallway. You can just see Tiberius blast

638
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:19,565
a bunch of ice, arc in the air.

639
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:26,029
SAM: Okay, so I know there's shit going on down
there, but I can't really see what. So I would

640
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:34,687
probably just Dimension Door into the tinkering
room, because that's where I assume Percy is. And

641
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:40,029
then I see what's going on, and nobody's there. Do
I have line-of-sight on anybody?

642
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:43,660
MATT: Currently, you see Percy through this
doorway right there.

643
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,677
SAM: Okay. Well, then. I can move also, can't I?

644
00:49:47,677 --> 00:49:49,313
MATT: Yeah, Dimension Door is your action.

645
00:49:49,313 --> 00:50:00,970
SAM: I'll move towards him. Oh, then I see a crazy
thing in front of me. Shit. So I probably take a

646
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,303
couple steps back.

647
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:07,283
(laughter)

648
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:19,862
SAM: And then I'll inspire Percy. (sings) All the
single Percys, all the single Percys.

649
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:27,681
ALL: (sing) All the single Percys, all the single
Percys, put your guns up-up-up.

650
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:30,053
MATT: d10 inspiration dice to you, Percy.

651
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:31,567
TALIESIN: What is that, a d10?

652
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:35,453
MATT: d10, yeah. That brings it to the top of the
combat round. Percy, you're up first.

653
00:50:35,453 --> 00:50:39,073
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to try and
clear my gun.

654
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:42,077
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and make your check.

655
00:50:42,077 --> 00:50:45,293
TALIESIN: What is that again? Did it change
since last time?

656
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:48,055
MATT: That one shouldn't have changed, no.

657
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:59,761
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's 11. I'm adding my bonus
die. God damn it. Nine.

658
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:07,893
MATT: Nine. As you pull over your Pepperbox,
you're like, (ping). The actual barrel comes off

659
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:11,634
and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back
of the room.

660
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:22,487
TALIESIN: I'm tossing it into my room. I'm using
an action surge. Actually, can I even do that?

661
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:30,849
Yes, I'm going to use my action surge, and I'm
going to walk over to the wraith on the ground,

662
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:34,748
put the barrel of Bad News up to it, and pull the
trigger.

663
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:38,558
MATT: The wraith is no longer on the ground, by
the way.

664
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:39,923
TALIESIN: Is he not?

665
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:45,655
MATT: The entity actually, upon looking, is immune
to being prone. So we won't retcon anything, but

666
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:48,605
as you go to pull the barrel up, you can see now
the face is standing up before you.

667
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,318
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try and shove it until
I hit something and then pull.

668
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:56,072
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage
with Bad News.

669
00:51:56,072 --> 00:52:00,659
TALIESIN: 22.

670
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,411
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

671
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,476
TRAVIS: Oh shit. We're all going to go deaf.

672
00:52:05,476 --> 00:52:09,811
LAURA: Oh man, that's going to be loud as fuck.

673
00:52:09,811 --> 00:52:17,655
TALIESIN: 19.

674
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:26,894
MATT: 19. (gunshot) Bad News goes off. The sound
is deafening in the room, the echoing of the

675
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:31,835
explosion through the stone walls. I'm going to go
ahead and have you roll a constitution saving

676
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:32,644
throw.

677
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:33,740
LIAM: Vax or Liam?

678
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,247
MATT: Vax. Both, maybe.

679
00:52:35,247 --> 00:52:36,491
LIAM: Roll a what now?

680
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:37,705
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

681
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:39,869
TALIESIN: If you fail, I get to scream in your
ear.

682
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,474
LIAM: That is a 15.

683
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:48,195
MATT: 15, okay. You don't go deaf, but your ears
are ringing very hard. The entity screams and then

684
00:52:48,195 --> 00:52:49,706
disperses.

685
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:52,665
TALIESIN: I get a grit point back.

686
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:56,188
MARISHA: You do! Dope.

687
00:52:56,188 --> 00:53:01,393
MATT: Okay, so two more attacks. Or you have to
use one to reload.

688
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:06,276
TALIESIN: I have to use one to reload. I have one
more attack, but I've already-- I didn't move. I'm

689
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:25,798
going to try and roll around the corner and I'm
going to take another shot. 27.

690
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:31,022
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

691
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:33,816
TALIESIN: 19 points of damage.

692
00:53:33,816 --> 00:53:40,407
MATT: Okay. This time (gunshot), the shot goes off
right by your head, Tiberius. You're flying in the

693
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:43,410
air and you look down and see him pull Bad News
out right beneath you, and before you have a

694
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:50,161
chance to react, (gunshot) the flash of the muzzle
just bursting forward, a big plume of black powder

695
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:52,787
smoke fills the air around you.

696
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:56,271
ORION: So I see a big flash? And what do I roll?

697
00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:58,358
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

698
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:59,742
TALIESIN: Sorry.

699
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:01,218
ORION: Seven.

700
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:04,496
MATT: Okay, you are considered deaf until the
start of his next turn.

701
00:54:04,496 --> 00:54:09,194
ORION: Okay, so as soon as I see the flash, I go,
(yelps). That's all I do.

702
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:12,991
(laughter)

703
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:18,742
MATT: So that ends your turn, Percy? All right.
Next, this entity that's Hunter's Marked is going to

704
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:30,999
rush forward, straight out of the grapple from
Jarett. Shifts right out of his hands. Is going to

705
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:40,104
run forward and take the double attack against the
prisoner. That's a 19 plus six. 25 hits. And 15

706
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:49,776
hits, as well. Takes 30 points of damage. Is
currently unconscious. Punches him twice, and you

707
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:54,086
see the poor driver is knocked up into the
ceiling, falls down onto the bed, and is

708
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:58,567
half-laying off. You see blood trickling down the
front of his face, his eyes open, and slowly

709
00:54:58,567 --> 00:54:59,901
close.

710
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:01,613
MARISHA: We need him alive.

711
00:55:01,613 --> 00:55:03,991
MATT: That brings us to Trinket's turn.

712
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:05,995
MARISHA: Come on, Trinket!

713
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:09,229
LAURA: Trinket roars, rushes forward.

714
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:15,098
MATT: Actually, we're now going to roll Trinket
into your turn.

715
00:55:15,098 --> 00:55:17,335
LAURA: Oh, all right. Then he stays there.

716
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:23,059
MATT: Okay. Trinket stays there until it's your
turn. Jarett is going to rush forward and come to

717
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:28,862
this corner. The crossbow is not much aid at this
point. Reaches over and pulls out a short sword

718
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:39,805
and lunges forward with the short sword. Yeah,
with disadvantage, nine. Oh god. Rolls a 20 and a

719
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:45,484
three. Great. Sorry, Jarett. Swinging through,
trying to pierce through the bars at this entity,

720
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:49,526
and can't seem to get any sort of attack to hit.

721
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:52,716
LAURA: So he's actually locked in the thing
still?

722
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:56,446
MATT: Jarett got the door open, he came through to
try and grab the creature, and as he tried to pull

723
00:55:56,446 --> 00:56:01,465
it back, the creature sifted through his hands
again to go ahead and attack the prisoner. That

724
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:03,726
ends Jarett's turn. Vex, it is now your turn.

725
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:06,921
LAURA: Okay. Can I move forward so I can see?

726
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:10,075
MATT: Yeah, you can see about there; it would give
you visual on the entity.

727
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:16,984
LAURA: All right. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll shoot
him. He's Hunter's Marked already, okay, good.

728
00:56:16,984 --> 00:56:19,479
MATT: He is, yes. So both attacks at
disadvantage.

729
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:24,767
LAURA: 15.

730
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:27,337
MATT: 15 hits. Just hits.

731
00:56:27,337 --> 00:56:39,277
LAURA: 16.

732
00:56:39,277 --> 00:56:44,173
MATT: 16 also hits-- oh, 16 damage. All right.
Including the additional Hunter's Mark?

733
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:47,848
LAURA: Yes. And then 14 doesn't hit.

734
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:53,355
MATT: 14 does not hit. The arrow disappears in the
back of the cell, scattering and shattering

735
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:55,104
against part of the stone wall.

736
00:56:55,104 --> 00:57:00,217
LAURA: And Trinket, can he get up to him? Oh, but
I took all the attacks.

737
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:02,704
MATT: Correct. So Trinket rushes up, but doesn't
attack.

738
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,896
LAURA: Trinket stays in the corner, then, because
he can't do shit.

739
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:11,600
MATT: Okay. Trinket just cheers you on. (bear
growl) Cool, that ends your turn. Keyleth.

740
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,759
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- seeing the direction
that everyone's pointing, going to walk up and

741
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:26,404
reach around Vex and I'm going to cast Faerie Fire
right-- oh god, wrong direction. Right in the

742
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:27,560
fucking eye.

743
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,617
(laughter)

744
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,378
LIAM: You turn on yourself.

745
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:39,137
MARISHA: Crit fail. It's a 20-foot cube, so I want
to cast it right in the cell.

746
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:49,337
MATT: Okay. So as you cast that, it's going to
attempt to make its save. What's the DC on that?

747
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:54,214
MARISHA: Against my spell's DC? 18.

748
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:59,665
MATT: And it fails with a 14. All right, so you
guys watch as she reaches her hand out. The entire

749
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:04,192
cell, all of a sudden there's a burst of purplish
light, and these little dust-stars of purple

750
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:09,248
glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling. As
they do, they cling to whatever this form is, and

751
00:58:09,248 --> 00:58:13,498
you can now see, very clearly, this invisible
entity that is surrounded in these purple

752
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:19,461
sparkles. It looks humanoid from the torso up, but
its legs are shimmering and shifting around. You

753
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:22,472
now have a very clear look on it. You've nullified
its invisibility.

754
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:24,989
MARISHA: You have advantage now.

755
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:29,307
MATT: Gives advantage, as well? Yeah. You guys now
all have advantage on this entity.

756
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:36,725
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action to
do Healing Word on the-- it's not Jarett that's

757
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,393
unconscious, it's the cab driver. On the cab
driver.

758
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:43,411
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll for the Healing
Word.

759
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:50,939
SAM: Desmond. Jarett and Desmond.

760
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:53,858
MATT: How much does he heal?

761
00:58:53,858 --> 00:59:08,871
MARISHA: Six plus my spell modifier. So ten? Is
that right, is that how it works? Plus my spell

762
00:59:08,871 --> 00:59:11,058
level? Is that what it is with Healing Word?

763
00:59:11,058 --> 00:59:15,622
MATT: I think it's plus five, whatever it is.
Healing Word, yeah.

764
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:17,544
MARISHA: 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability
modifier.

765
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:19,071
MATT: So it's plus six.

766
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:20,947
MARISHA: Six, so 12.

767
00:59:20,947 --> 00:59:26,157
MATT: 12. Got you. Okay. Desmond's eyes clarify
for a second and he begins to breathe heavily.

768
00:59:26,157 --> 00:59:30,251
Still looking very wounded, but conscious and
prone across the bed, as the entity that's

769
00:59:30,251 --> 00:59:33,571
Hunter's Marked is still looming over it, bringing
its fists up for another round to try and finish

770
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:36,707
its job. That ends your turn, Keyleth. Grog,
you're up.

771
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:42,466
TRAVIS: There you are. Hold still, Casper! And I
run up and I swing.

772
00:59:42,466 --> 00:59:45,190
(laughter)

773
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:48,185
MATT: As you rush up angrily, make your strike.

774
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,737
TRAVIS: That's 28.

775
00:59:51,737 --> 00:59:53,297
MATT: That hits.

776
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:57,737
TRAVIS: That's a 27.

777
00:59:57,737 --> 00:59:59,005
MATT: Hits.

778
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:00,548
LIAM: Those would hit Tiamat.

779
01:00:00,548 --> 01:00:03,643
TRAVIS: 17.

780
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:08,268
MATT: 17 also hits, so roll damage three times. As
you rush up, the bars open, bringing the axe down

781
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:10,524
on top of this now sparkling purple entity.

782
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:15,681
TRAVIS: Ten, so 14 on the first one, plus fire
damage.

783
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,247
MATT: Cool.

784
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:27,206
TRAVIS: 17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do
that right?

785
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,362
LAURA: Yeah?

786
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:30,815
TRAVIS: Yeah. So 21. The second one.

787
01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:32,075
MATT: Okay.

788
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:37,013
TRAVIS: And 17, 21 again!

789
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:45,891
MATT: Nice! All righty, so you run up (hammer
strikes) hammer down a third time, you can see its

790
01:00:45,952 --> 01:00:50,986
body being beaten around by the attack. And you
see the whispering of its wind around its lower

791
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:53,929
body is starting to slow, and it's looking like
it's getting more sluggish, but it's definitely

792
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:57,830
still intent on its job. That ends your turn,
Grog. Vax, you're up.

793
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:02,904
LIAM: All right, in a split second I'm watching
Grog take the thing apart. I size up everybody in

794
01:01:02,904 --> 01:01:07,751
front of me in the distance and I think I can
Assassin Creed my way through the crowd because I

795
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:13,240
can go 60 feet normally, so 30 feet if it's
crowded, and I'm going to use Grog's proximity to

796
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,008
take this thing apart.

797
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:17,890
MATT: Okay. I will say you would normally get
advantage. Because you're attacking it through the

798
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,320
bars, melee, it disables it, so it's just a
straight attack. You're having to fight it through

799
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,533
prison bars with daggers, which is difficult.

800
01:01:24,533 --> 01:01:27,331
LIAM: All right. So the first one is terrible,
it's a 14.

801
01:01:27,331 --> 01:01:29,023
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately.

802
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:31,392
LIAM: And that's where the sneak attack damage is,
right?

803
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:34,806
MATT: Well, it's the first attack you get on it
would get it. So even if you miss the first

804
01:01:34,806 --> 01:01:36,836
attack, you can still get it with the second and
third.

805
01:01:36,836 --> 01:01:39,797
LIAM: All right. Third one is a 21.

806
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:40,795
MATT: That does hit.

807
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:58,076
LIAM: So there's the delivery system, and that is
the Keen Dagger. 26, 27, 32. 38.

808
01:01:58,076 --> 01:02:04,180
MATT: All right. With that, the first blade comes
through and you try and get it through the bars

809
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,383
and it gets nothing. You pull back, take the other
dagger and swing through it. Falls too wide and

810
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,646
you have to bring your arm back. This time, you
can see after Grog has slammed it with the hammer,

811
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:17,203
it falls. The sparkles come towards the edge.
Its slamming its back into the bars. It's right

812
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:19,979
there in front of you, and you use that instance
to go ahead and reach through the bars, grab it by

813
01:02:19,979 --> 01:02:28,530
the throat, and stab it repeatedly, at which point
its form disperses into wind around you.

814
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:36,806
LIAM: And I slap Grog on the back and say, you
softened the shit of him. That's terrible

815
01:02:36,806 --> 01:02:39,860
English. You softened him up for me! Asshole.

816
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,425
TRAVIS: You've been drinking?

817
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:45,835
LAURA: (giggling) You softened the shit of him.

818
01:02:45,835 --> 01:02:49,124
LIAM: You shitted him up for me, Grog. Good job.

819
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:56,100
MATT: You guys look over. You see Desmond is still
on the bed, eyes wide (panting).

820
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:03,343
ORION: I rush over to Desmond, and out of my pouch
I bring out a sandwich that I had made earlier. I

821
01:03:03,343 --> 01:03:08,564
hand it to him and I go, Desmond, decker. Here,
have it. It's a decker sandwich. You should have

822
01:03:08,564 --> 01:03:09,541
it.

823
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,713
MATT: Gets up on the bed and takes it. "What
happened?"

824
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:16,282
LAURA: I run up and I cast Cure Wounds on him.

825
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:18,890
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll for the Cure
Wounds heal on that.

826
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,102
TRAVIS: You casting that all over the place now
aren't you, fancy-pants?

827
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:28,651
SAM: From the tinkering room I yell out, is it
safe? Can I come out now?

828
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:30,607
ORION: It's safe.

829
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,485
LIAM: There's four more of them. Stay back.

830
01:03:32,485 --> 01:03:34,300
SAM: Oh! Okay. I'll stay.

831
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,369
TRAVIS: I remember I have the holy oil in my hand,
mixed with the blood, and I start blessing him. With

832
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:42,178
bloody fist.

833
01:03:42,178 --> 01:03:43,445
LAURA: 17.

834
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,709
MATT: All right, awesome.

835
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:47,294
LAURA: Do I add my wisdom to that?

836
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:49,219
MATT: You add your wisdom modifier.

837
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:51,550
LAURA: Then it's 20.

838
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:55,467
MATT: That's good to know. All right, cool. All
right.

839
01:03:55,467 --> 01:03:56,911
ORION: How's that sandwich?

840
01:03:56,911 --> 01:04:02,622
MATT: Desmond isn't eating it. He's just holding
it and still taking in. "What happened? What was

841
01:04:02,622 --> 01:04:04,928
"that?! Look, what was that thing?"

842
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,804
TRAVIS: Yeah, what was that thing?

843
01:04:07,804 --> 01:04:09,230
LAURA: What was that thing?

844
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,945
ORION: I would say opaque buttholes.

845
01:04:10,945 --> 01:04:13,063
MARISHA: Can we do a check?

846
01:04:13,063 --> 01:04:14,611
MATT: Make an arcana check.

847
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,955
TALIESIN: I'll make an arcana check, too.

848
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:18,914
SAM: How did you get two?

849
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:20,771
ORION: I rolled one by accident.

850
01:04:20,771 --> 01:04:28,527
MATT: If you rolled by accident, you have to roll
intentionally to take the score. Because if you

851
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:31,758
were to accidentally roll really bad, you'd be
like, "That doesn't count! I didn't actually

852
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:33,004
"roll."

853
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:34,616
ORION: A hard 12.

854
01:04:34,616 --> 01:04:35,839
MATT: Total of 12?

855
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,764
LIAM: I rolled a 22 arcana check.

856
01:04:37,764 --> 01:04:39,135
MARISHA: 22?

857
01:04:39,135 --> 01:04:42,460
LAURA: Oh, he's faced these things before. That's
what it is.

858
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:48,298
MATT: That's the thing, you've seen these. These
entities are used by certain high-level arcane

859
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:54,309
practitioners. They can be summoned as certain
spells. They're air elemental-based in nature, but

860
01:04:54,309 --> 01:05:03,328
they're generally known as invisible stalkers.
They're used as assassins that have a very sole,

861
01:05:03,328 --> 01:05:04,445
single-minded purpose.

862
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:07,228
LIAM: All I know is they feel like the
Briarwoods.

863
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:11,047
MATT: You get that, based on recent events,
there's probably a good probability that was the

864
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:12,349
source of this.

865
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:17,358
LAURA: Do you know from your previous experience
if there's any way to protect against them? Other

866
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:18,976
than setting up walls?

867
01:05:18,976 --> 01:05:23,138
LIAM: Well, all I know is how to stick my face in
the beehives, apparently.

868
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:28,203
LAURA: Does anybody know how to protect against
air stalkers?

869
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,051
ORION: Give me a day, I will find out.

870
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:37,111
MATT: Jarett, at which point has put his hand
against the wall, and goes, "Ugh. I would

871
01:05:37,111 --> 01:05:41,356
"recommend that next time you decide to put me on
watch, let me know if we're up against things that

872
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:45,654
"are invisible. I apologize. I was not prepared for
such a foe to show up."

873
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:49,095
LAURA: We were unprepared to warn you. I'm sorry.

874
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:54,837
MATT: "It's all right. If I might ask, what
exactly are we up against here?"

875
01:05:54,837 --> 01:05:56,225
TRAVIS: Fuck if we know.

876
01:05:56,225 --> 01:06:03,094
ORION: Seems like we're up against either vampires
or liches. Prepare the troops. There will be some

877
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:07,568
changes made to the keep over the next couple of
days. We shall shore up security, as well.

878
01:06:07,568 --> 01:06:12,904
MATT: "I would like also to consider possibly some
changes made to our income, as this suddenly

879
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:17,839
"turned from a general guarding job to going up
against the denizens of the afterlife. It's

880
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,874
"already been a very dangerous proposition."

881
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:24,147
ORION: Of course. We shall discuss that in the--
is it the morning?

882
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:28,038
MATT: "Very well. I'm going to go ahead and make
sure the rest of my team is alive."

883
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:30,278
LIAM: Jarett! Are you up for it?

884
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,473
MATT: "If the pay is good, yes."

885
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:35,267
LAURA: Jarett's up for anything.

886
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:42,230
MATT: "You understand. Ugh, okay. Talk to you in
the morning. I think a bit of rest is necessary."

887
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:47,705
And he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of
the keep. Desmond at this point is still in shock,

888
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:50,301
and he starts absentmindedly eating the sandwich
that you handed him.

889
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:53,972
ORION: It's good, right? I had one yesterday.

890
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:57,939
LAURA: Well. Maybe it's best not to leave him down
here.

891
01:06:57,939 --> 01:07:01,367
ORION: No. You should stay in the guest room.
Come.

892
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:03,728
MATT: "Is it safer there?"

893
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,239
ORION: Yes, it is.

894
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:07,958
MATT: "I told you they'd come for me. I told you
they would."

895
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:11,650
LAURA: But you know what! You're still alive.

896
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,950
SAM: You've had the worst couple of days.

897
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:18,961
MATT: Wipes the blood from the side of his face
and looks at it.

898
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:34,762
ORION: Let's take you upstairs and get you all
fitted... Who do we talk to that works for us that

899
01:07:34,762 --> 01:07:37,732
does the actual construction to the keep?

900
01:07:37,732 --> 01:07:44,484
LAURA: That is one of Uriel's staff. In which
case, we cannot talk to them right now.

901
01:07:44,484 --> 01:07:50,535
MATT: Yeah, the individual responsible for the
construction of the keep was Lord Riskel Daxio,

902
01:07:50,535 --> 01:07:55,455
which is an elven gentleman on the Council that
helped oversee the whole construction and helped

903
01:07:55,455 --> 01:07:57,162
you guys design it, so.

904
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:58,941
LIAM: Is he still on the bed?

905
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,156
MATT: Still on the bed.

906
01:08:00,156 --> 01:08:06,248
LIAM: I sit down next to him and say, listen. You
are a victim of circumstance, we understand that.

907
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:13,485
We are, to a certain degree, as well. We're not
leaving your side, and really there's no other

908
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:19,591
choice. I mean, you're fucked like we are. So we
will do our best to protect you, I promise you.

909
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:23,277
MATT: "Okay."

910
01:08:23,277 --> 01:08:27,132
TRAVIS: I volunteer to sleep down in the room.

911
01:08:27,132 --> 01:08:28,691
LIAM: Oh wow.

912
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:30,285
ORION: He shall stay in my quarters.

913
01:08:30,285 --> 01:08:32,553
TRAVIS: It's better down here, isn't it?

914
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:36,572
LIAM: In a locked cell with Grog? I think is
pretty safe.

915
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:40,892
LAURA: I think it's probably better to bring him
upstairs, because if it's locked, we can't get to

916
01:08:40,892 --> 01:08:42,519
him very quickly.

917
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:47,278
ORION: Don't worry, we can enchant his room, as
well, to have an alert thing go on if anything

918
01:08:47,278 --> 01:08:52,280
happens in the room at night, and it would be
safer. I shall be sleeping in my laboratory for

919
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,066
the next several nights, as well.

920
01:08:54,066 --> 01:09:02,525
MARISHA: I mean, I can still go ahead and do the
planar bindings to an elemental that maybe I

921
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:07,848
should've done beforehand. It lasts 30 days.

922
01:09:07,848 --> 01:09:12,540
LIAM: I like all of these things, but I think Grog
as a bunkmate is a good idea.

923
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:18,250
MATT: At this point, Desmond leans into you and
quietly says in your ear, Vax, he goes, "Is where

924
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:23,007
"I'm sleeping going to be away from him?" He looks
over towards Percy.

925
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:26,714
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally away from him.

926
01:09:26,714 --> 01:09:31,089
MARISHA: It's fine. You'll have him in between you
and him.

927
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:33,643
MATT: You don't hear that; it's whispered to Vax.

928
01:09:33,643 --> 01:09:44,730
LIAM: There is a lot of history for Percy wrapped
up in this and he has done you wrong, no question.

929
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:54,420
But the answer is yes. You will be separate from
Percival. You will be protected. And you have my

930
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,726
word.

931
01:09:55,726 --> 01:09:57,844
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

932
01:09:57,844 --> 01:09:59,684
LAURA: And you have my axe!

933
01:09:59,684 --> 01:10:07,190
LIAM: I'm going to use some Luck. Using my Luck.
Natural 20, with Luck.

934
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:11,752
MATT: Takes another bite of the sandwich and packs
it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a

935
01:10:11,752 --> 01:10:15,126
pocket, puts it in there. And you know, you can
still see as he brings his hand up, you can see the

936
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:19,722
blood streak against where the fingers were on the
lower half of that hand. Strokes the edge of his

937
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:27,728
chin and goes, "Okay. I trust you. Please. Please
don't let them kill me."

938
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:32,023
LIAM: We may be fuck-ups--

939
01:10:32,023 --> 01:10:34,201
ORION: Speak for yourself.

940
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:40,085
LIAM: But we're not without ability. You have my
word. I promise you.

941
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:44,554
MATT: "Okay. I'm very tired."

942
01:10:44,554 --> 01:10:51,732
LAURA: Desmond, dear. Let's go upstairs. Grog!
That bed needs to go back up to the guest room.

943
01:10:51,732 --> 01:10:57,162
TRAVIS: Fucking hell. I start to take the fucking
bed up the stairs.

944
01:10:57,162 --> 01:11:01,310
MATT: Takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so
to bring it out of there, fitting it through the

945
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,700
door.

946
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,243
ORION: Erwen! Where is that old man?

947
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:13,192
MATT: As you call out, Erwen eventually comes
down. "Hi. Yes, Tiberius. You called? It's quite

948
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:15,999
"early in the morning." He has his night cap on and
he's rubbing at his eyes.

949
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:17,344
MARISHA: What time is it?

950
01:11:17,344 --> 01:11:21,593
MATT: Right now, it's about probably 6:30 in the
morning or so. It's just after sunrise; you guys

951
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:23,137
haven't even slept yet.

952
01:11:23,137 --> 01:11:29,065
ORION: Oh. Shit. Never mind, I'll talk to you once
we've slept. Go back to sleep. I didn't realize

953
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:33,220
what time it was! I thought it was 10:00 AM, which
is totally different than 6:00 AM. I didn't know

954
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,270
that.

955
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:40,593
MATT: "It's all right. All right. In the morning
then, Master Tiberius." And he goes off to his bed

956
01:11:40,593 --> 01:11:41,862
to sleep.

957
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,170
TRAVIS: We go to sleep?

958
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,956
LAURA: Yeah, we need to sleep.

959
01:11:44,956 --> 01:11:52,861
SAM: I gently fall asleep under Percy's workbench,
where I've been hiding this whole time.

960
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:54,926
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

961
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,435
TALIESIN: Not going to sleep down there.

962
01:11:56,435 --> 01:11:58,766
SAM: Natural 20.

963
01:11:58,766 --> 01:12:03,151
MATT: All right, so. As the rest of you go to
sleep--

964
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:06,360
TALIESIN: I'm going to go into my workshop.

965
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:13,469
LIAM: On my way up, I fall in next to Keyleth.
Ask, is your hand all right?

966
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:15,105
MARISHA: It's fine.

967
01:12:15,105 --> 01:12:16,747
LIAM: Do you need anything?

968
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:18,168
MARISHA: Nope.

969
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:24,843
TRAVIS: Since he's sleeping in the room with me, I
take a few of the caltrops that I have and I put

970
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:27,747
them on the inside of the doorway before I close
it.

971
01:12:27,747 --> 01:12:31,150
MATT: Okay. So you guys are doing your setup
there. Percy, you're in your workshop. Go ahead and

972
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,885
roll a perception check, Percy.

973
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:37,201
TALIESIN: 17.

974
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:39,744
MATT: 17. Okay. You go about your work.

975
01:12:39,744 --> 01:12:41,394
TALIESIN: I'm fixing my gun.

976
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:48,487
MATT: Okay. The materials that it requires you to
do so are expensive, you actually have to pay the

977
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:50,934
cost of the gun, and go ahead and make another
check.

978
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:52,541
SAM: The fuck is that sound?

979
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:58,928
MATT: So go ahead and make another tinkering check. And
the cost of the Pepperbox should be at the bottom

980
01:12:58,928 --> 01:13:00,027
of your--

981
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:02,211
TALIESIN: Is it the whole cost or half?

982
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:06,817
MATT: Should be half the cost. It should say under
the repair rules for a misfire.

983
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:15,077
TALIESIN: Half cost. Oh my god, that's awful.
Okay, tinkering check. 12.

984
01:13:15,077 --> 01:13:16,695
MATT: 12. Okay.

985
01:13:16,695 --> 01:13:18,609
TALIESIN: Technically, that would be a success.

986
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:24,562
MATT: Yeah. So you take the rest of the morning,
unsleeping, the dark bags under your eyes. You

987
01:13:24,562 --> 01:13:26,051
manage to get the Pepperbox back in working
order.

988
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:28,527
TALIESIN: Oh, I was asleep. I wasn't with them, so
I just woke up really early.

989
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:34,203
MATT: Right, right. But even so, even though you
slept, it hasn't been very restful. It's been

990
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:40,455
technically enough to rest, but your evening has
been fraught with nightmares. Perpetually. But

991
01:13:40,455 --> 01:13:43,816
your Pepperbox is repaired, and does cost you half
the cost of the weapon cost to repair.

992
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:45,392
TALIESIN: 75 gold.

993
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:48,263
ORION: I sleep in my little nook in my
laboratory.

994
01:13:48,263 --> 01:13:55,020
MATT: Okay. You guys rest through the rest of the
morning, waking up past noon, probably about 2:00

995
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:02,057
in the afternoon. You all gradually begin to come to
consciousness. Make your way downstairs. As you

996
01:14:02,057 --> 01:14:12,037
come downstairs, you can already smell breakfast
has been prepared. You can see Laina already has

997
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:15,871
the meal set out for you, and as you guys
approach, "Oh it's so nice of all of you to come

998
01:14:15,871 --> 01:14:20,785
"down! It was very interesting. These very nice
folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole

999
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:28,976
"bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff. Makes
for a great meal. It was very nice of them. Food

1000
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:32,670
"is served." And she gives out the plates and
gives you a smile.

1001
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:35,068
TRAVIS: I love you. (eating noises)

1002
01:14:35,068 --> 01:14:36,819
LIAM: Is this a frittata?

1003
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:40,251
MATT: "I believe that's what it's called in some
circles. I'm trying a few new things!"

1004
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:42,121
TRAVIS: Can I make a beard check?

1005
01:14:42,121 --> 01:14:46,350
ORION: I'm going to take some food and feed it to
Lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the

1006
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,082
day.

1007
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:48,227
TRAVIS: 66.

1008
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:50,433
MATT: No effect, unfortunately.

1009
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:52,631
TRAVIS: Just a little tingle?

1010
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:57,901
MATT: There is a slight tingle, but it's mostly a
placebo.

1011
01:14:57,901 --> 01:15:01,760
(laughter)

1012
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:08,201
MATT: As you guys are having your meals and you're
trying and you're feeding food, teaching this,

1013
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:10,485
everyone roll a perception check.

1014
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:12,562
LIAM: At home?

1015
01:15:12,562 --> 01:15:17,068
ORION: 16!

1016
01:15:17,068 --> 01:15:18,438
LIAM: I rolled a one.

1017
01:15:18,438 --> 01:15:19,600
MARISHA: 17.

1018
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,129
LIAM: This frittata is lovely.

1019
01:15:21,129 --> 01:15:22,914
SAM: Six.

1020
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:24,462
TRAVIS: Eight.

1021
01:15:24,462 --> 01:15:26,557
LAURA: 16. But my passive is 21.

1022
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:35,863
MATT: Right, understood. Good to know. Percy's
down in his workshop. As you guys are in the

1023
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:42,114
middle of your meal, you hear, clearing the
stillness and quiet of the low munching-up,

1024
01:15:42,114 --> 01:15:49,507
(clears throat) and sitting at the table adjacent
to you guys, completely unnoticed in his entry, is

1025
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:51,694
Seeker Asum, arms crossed.

1026
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:54,465
LAURA: Motherfucker, you are sneaky! I need to
talk to you.

1027
01:15:54,465 --> 01:15:56,085
TRAVIS: We are not cool right now.

1028
01:15:56,085 --> 01:16:00,520
MATT: "Well, obviously not. That's why I'm here to
have a conversation with the rest of you. Please

1029
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,497
"continue to eat. I don't mean to disturb you."

1030
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:03,864
ORION: Oh, very well.

1031
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:06,129
LAURA: Help yourself to a frittata.

1032
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,731
MATT: "I've already eaten, but I appreciate the
offer."

1033
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,921
ORION: Try this hakuna frittata. It's really
good!

1034
01:16:10,921 --> 01:16:12,218
TRAVIS: Hakuna matata?

1035
01:16:12,218 --> 01:16:14,077
LAURA: Let him talk.

1036
01:16:14,077 --> 01:16:24,483
MATT: "What a wonderful meal. Well, things have
certainly gotten sticky, haven't they? Well, first

1037
01:16:24,483 --> 01:16:30,632
"and foremost, I would like to thank you, Keyleth,
for clearing my head. Lord Briarwood had locked me

1038
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:35,739
"into some form of mental charm during my attempt
to aid Vax--"

1039
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:41,458
MARISHA: I told you it worked! Sorry, I'm a little
defensive right now. Continue.

1040
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:45,258
MATT: "That's all right. Things are a bit mixed
up. It's hard to explain; let's just say I have

1041
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:52,550
"been clouded in my judgment for the past few days
until you cleansed me. I'm sorry to uphold the

1042
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,806
"charade back in the palace."

1043
01:16:54,806 --> 01:17:00,353
LIAM: Apologies are mine, I think. I believe you
had some sort of plan, and I thought I knew

1044
01:17:00,353 --> 01:17:02,272
better, and for that I'm sorry.

1045
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:08,870
MATT: "I cannot say that is untrue. But I accept
your apology."

1046
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,948
LAURA: Can I roll for insight?

1047
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:12,525
MATT: You may.

1048
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:14,310
LIAM: Roll high!

1049
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:20,918
LAURA: I know! That was a shit roll. Nine.

1050
01:17:20,918 --> 01:17:27,825
MATT: He's a hard person to gauge, anyway. You
gathered over time that most of his work deals in

1051
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:33,690
a network of spies and the gathering of
information across all of Tal'Dorei, so he is very

1052
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:38,884
well-trained to hide the essence of his true
nature and the intent. Hard to read. But he seems

1053
01:17:38,884 --> 01:17:47,018
pleasant as he's been, and given the
circumstances. "Nevertheless, I accept your

1054
01:17:47,018 --> 01:17:53,820
"apology, and I apologize for having upheld the
charade during the council meeting, but I had to

1055
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:59,347
"keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of
stir at the time. I fear, based on my observations

1056
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:05,985
"since, that our very own sovereign also fell to
the same charm I did and has been clouded since

1057
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,818
"the dinner the night before."

1058
01:18:07,818 --> 01:18:09,820
LAURA: Shit! That makes sense.

1059
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,342
MARISHA: We were afraid of that.

1060
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:13,252
SAM: He's fallen for that stuff before.

1061
01:18:13,252 --> 01:18:18,028
MATT: "He's been through quite a bit, and while
he's a resolute and a very good man, I would say

1062
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:21,600
"that he is predisposed to outer influence from
those that are quite strong-willed."

1063
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:28,078
SAM: And this is why you kept up our accusations
against us in front of him?

1064
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:33,190
MATT: "Under those conditions, the room filled
with guards that were all intent against keeping

1065
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:37,218
"you at bay. Should you have made any attempt to
try and cleanse him as well during that time, I

1066
01:18:37,218 --> 01:18:39,920
"think you all would have wound up in prison. Or
worse."

1067
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:45,501
MARISHA: So why didn't you want to show that you
were also cleansed? What was the point of holding

1068
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:46,905
up the charade?

1069
01:18:46,905 --> 01:18:54,011
MATT: "Because when you're under this influence,
to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is

1070
01:18:54,011 --> 01:18:58,645
"to draw a line. I wish to stay in his good graces
because that would enable us a much better chance

1071
01:18:58,645 --> 01:19:02,962
"of getting you close enough to him to absolve him
of this charm. If I was to reveal this

1072
01:19:02,962 --> 01:19:07,768
"instantaneously in the presence of the entire
council, I fear that might have put me in the same

1073
01:19:07,768 --> 01:19:14,781
"court of disfavor as you and lost any future
chance of expelling this influence."

1074
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:18,480
LAURA: Do you it's only Uriel, or do you think
it's the rest of the council as well?

1075
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:28,951
MATT: "Best I can gather, most of the council is
not as well-- how do I put it? Not used to

1076
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:34,004
"business with Vox Machina. Allura seems to be of
clear mind, as she is very powerfully protected

"against such influences and did not have any
immediate interaction with the Briarwoods during

1078
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:44,024
"that dinner. I fear the intent was on the
sovereign himself."

1079
01:19:44,024 --> 01:19:51,059
SAM: Wait, are you saying that the Briarwoods
corrupted him?

1080
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:53,010
MATT: "Same way they corrupted me."

1081
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,141
SAM: During the dinner? While we were all sitting
there?

1082
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:57,348
MATT: "Apparently, it takes naught but a glance."

1083
01:19:57,348 --> 01:20:00,250
LAURA: Oh shit! They could have gotten any of us.

1084
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:07,027
ORION: Yes. They did. Me. It was rather
inconvenient. I hate them. Sorry.

1085
01:20:07,027 --> 01:20:09,150
MATT: "I think we have something in common."

1086
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,395
SAM: Aren't you deaf?

1087
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:13,493
LIAM: No, that was brief.

1088
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:15,790
ORION: I mean, what?

1089
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:19,215
SAM: Is that why you're talking so loud?

1090
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:21,013
ORION: Yes. I was getting it back.

1091
01:20:21,013 --> 01:20:27,642
MATT: "There are a few options at our disposal.
You could continue to work to clear your name,

1092
01:20:27,642 --> 01:20:33,118
"during his distraction southward, if you have some
idea as to how we could get close enough to him to

1093
01:20:33,118 --> 01:20:38,118
"absolve him of this now, that would leave the risk
of, should anything go poorly, being poked with

1094

"many spear holes."

1095
01:20:39,414 --> 01:20:45,665
LAURA: Is it possible to sneak into his room, and
restore him without anybody knowing?

1096
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:51,192
MATT: "If you're confident. That may be more of a
mission for the quieter of your bunch, should they

1097
01:20:51,192 --> 01:20:54,879
"be a little more intelligent with their actions,
going forward."

1098
01:20:54,879 --> 01:20:58,409
ORION: What about drawing him out to a luncheon or
whatnot?

1099
01:20:58,409 --> 01:21:04,190
MATT: "I will say, based on recent circumstances,
he is very careful and defensive."

1100
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:10,920
LIAM: I have fair chances of getting in, but no
ability to cure him of any such thing.

1101

LAURA: What if Keyleth, who can do it, polymorphed

1102
01:21:18,447 --> 01:21:23,356
you, you snuck in, she popped out, did the thing.
Money.

1103
01:21:23,356 --> 01:21:30,099
SAM: (laughs) Unless they're caught, in which
case, you've got two of our members against the

1104
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:32,117
entire palace guard.

1105
01:21:32,117 --> 01:21:35,913
LAURA: So then you go with them and Dimension Door
out.

1106
01:21:35,913 --> 01:21:39,406
SAM: I didn't even want to face the little
invisible thing downstairs!

1107
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:43,558
ORION: Why don't we hold a special dinner?

1108
01:21:43,558 --> 01:21:46,493
SAM: He hates our fucking guts.

1109
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:49,538
TRAVIS: Why don't we let Seeker Asum finish?

1110
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:55,410
SAM: Seeker Asum, in your opinion, is it safer to
try and heal him or to try and clear our name

1111
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,118
through the traditional legal means?

1112
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:06,924
MATT: "Honestly, I have no idea. I think this
plan, if successful, is quite inspired. However,

1113
01:22:06,924 --> 01:22:14,736
"failure would probably end in the immediate
incarceration and/or death of both individuals

1114
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:22,390
"involved. Public execution does not befit the
country-wide name of Vox Machina, if you were to

1115
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:26,603
"fail. If you were to succeed, that would be the
most direct route between two points."

1116
01:22:26,603 --> 01:22:30,917
MARISHA: So are we in agreement that we have to
clear Uriel's mind first?

1117
01:22:30,917 --> 01:22:36,844
SAM: No. No, the other option is to clear our
names and not worry about clearing his mind.

1118
01:22:36,844 --> 01:22:41,452
LAURA: Uriel, if he's got his mind controlled, it
doesn't matter if we try to clear our names, he's

1119
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:42,747
going to find us guilty.

1120
01:22:42,747 --> 01:22:46,498
SAM: But during our trial, we will have a direct
line of sight to him, we might be able to get

1121
01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:47,938
through to him.

1122
01:22:47,938 --> 01:22:49,667
LIAM: Does he still trust Allura?

1123
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,527
MATT: "As far as I know, yes."

1124
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:55,421
TRAVIS: You know, if we kill the Briarwoods, is
this even a point?

1125
01:22:55,421 --> 01:23:01,017
SAM: That's true. He doesn't trust Allura, she
wasn't even allowed in the room to talk to us.

1126
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:04,928
There's definitely suspicion there, right?

1127
01:23:04,928 --> 01:23:07,789
LIAM: He did. He did question her allegiances.

1128
01:23:07,789 --> 01:23:14,522
MATT: "If that's the case, then perhaps her
current power is not as strong in the council when

1129
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:19,922
"regarding you. But she is still a member of the
council, should she not be immediately affiliated

1130
01:23:19,922 --> 01:23:28,462
"with you for her purposes. This is up to you.
Whatever you choose to do, if it requires my aid,

1131
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:36,233
"I will give it a day before I have to leave. My
next intent is to head-- well, I wish to go past

1132
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:41,478
"the eastern curtain set up by Whitestone into
Wildemount. I have spent the better part of the

1133
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:46,565
"past day since the cleansing seeking all records
of the Briarwoods and their doings. There was a

1134
01:23:46,565 --> 01:23:51,803
"period of about eight years in which there is no
public record of their goings-on. It appears that

1135
01:23:51,803 --> 01:23:56,528
"most records that deal with their involvement in
Wildemount, and whatever homestead gave them their

1136
01:23:56,528 --> 01:24:01,580
"title, Lord and Lady Briarwood, has all been but
erased. So I intend to go to the source,

1137
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,864
"Wildemount itself, and research. This will take me
some time, of course."

1138
01:24:04,864 --> 01:24:06,514
ORION: When do you plan on leaving?

1139
01:24:06,514 --> 01:24:08,770
MATT: "Sooner the better. I was thinking
tomorrow."

1140
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,845
MARISHA: Is Percy here? Is Percy in the room?

1141
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:13,134
MATT: Percy is not even here. Percy is down in the
workshop.

1142
01:24:13,134 --> 01:24:15,487
MARISHA: I go get Percy.

1143
01:24:15,487 --> 01:24:16,645
MATT: Okay.

1144
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:19,469
TALIESIN: I was going to be at the door.

1145
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:23,059
MARISHA: Oh. I come around the corner, and I see
Percy.

1146
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,526
MATT: As you come around the corner, Percy is
currently leaning up against the side of the wall,

1147
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:27,585
listening in to the conversation.

1148
01:24:27,585 --> 01:24:35,059
MARISHA: Hey! I was looking for you. You want to
come and actually join the conversation for once,

1149
01:24:35,059 --> 01:24:39,673
instead of sitting outside the door and just
listening to them? Because I really feel like this

1150
01:24:39,673 --> 01:24:44,371
is going to be your time to input and maybe
really help?

1151
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,361
TALIESIN: I don't feel like doing that. Oh. Lead
on.

1152
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:48,847
MARISHA: Okay.

1153
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:58,264
TRAVIS: Seeker Asum, we have managed to capture
and keep one of the coachmen. Down in our cell.

1154
01:24:58,264 --> 01:25:05,095
Would he be safer in our hands, or within the
castle walls?

1155
01:25:05,095 --> 01:25:06,713
MARISHA: Percy and I walk in.

1156
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:08,187
TRAVIS: I'm fucking asking.

1157
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:14,939
MATT: "Well, that depends. If you have strong
defenses, and the enemy has no means of entering,

1158
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:19,855
"then he will be safer here. The palace itself is a
very well-protected area; however, there currently

1159
01:25:19,855 --> 01:25:31,149
"is an open invitation into the palace, and if the
essence of our enemy is as I think it is, then

1160
01:25:31,149 --> 01:25:33,753
"they can enter whenever they like."

1161
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:35,502
TRAVIS: Never mind.

1162
01:25:35,502 --> 01:25:40,968
LIAM: I think we're really choosing between two
paths here. Either we stay in town and tinker and

1163
01:25:40,968 --> 01:25:45,476
gamble, or we're runaways.

1164
01:25:45,476 --> 01:25:49,415
SAM: Runaways? No, we go to the Briarwoods--

1165
01:25:49,415 --> 01:25:54,521
LIAM: That's what I'm talking about. The minute we
leave, we're outlaws. They've told us not to go.

1166
01:25:54,521 --> 01:26:00,472
ORION: We can leave, we just cannot flee. We can
travel as we see fit. We just need to let them

1167
01:26:00,472 --> 01:26:02,490
know where we're going.

1168
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:08,244
LIAM: Yeah, but we can't tell them 'we're going to
check out your associates'.

1169
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:10,015
TRAVIS: Yeah, we lie.

1170
01:26:10,015 --> 01:26:12,865
MARISHA: Wait, what's the name of the town?

1171
01:26:12,865 --> 01:26:14,334
SAM: Whitestone?

1172
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:19,295
MARISHA: Not Whitestone. Oh, I thought he was
saying he was going to go to their hometown.

1173
01:26:19,295 --> 01:26:22,976
MATT: He's going to Wildemount, the kingdom that
they're originally from. The continent to the far

1174
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,111
east.

1175
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:33,071
MARISHA: He's not going to Whitestone. He's going
to go to Wildemount, which is on another

1176
01:26:33,071 --> 01:26:37,941
continent. If we go to another continent, it
doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not. It's going

1177
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:39,427
to look like fleeing.

1178
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:41,288
TRAVIS: Why are you going to Wildemount, again?

1179
01:26:41,288 --> 01:26:46,555
MATT: "I'm trying to find as much information to
incriminate them in case whatever you're

1180
01:26:46,555 --> 01:26:48,333
"attempting does not work."

1181
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:55,080
ORION: Seeker, would you mind staying for a week
or so before your venture? We need time to

1182
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:00,707
convince the council to let us leave without
conflict and to procure particular items and

1183
01:27:00,707 --> 01:27:04,061
things that we need. Very briefly. Would just take
some time.

1184
01:27:04,061 --> 01:27:12,488
MATT: "I have already made arrangements for
travel. I could try, but depends on what you need

1185
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:14,019
"me here for."

1186
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:16,356
TRAVIS: What do we need him here for?

1187
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,731
ORION: Ultimately, protection or a good ear.

1188
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:27,260
MARISHA: Do you genuinely think they're going to
let us go with permission? We're not on their good

1189
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,187
side.

1190
01:27:28,187 --> 01:27:30,491
LAURA: No, they're not. They're not going to let
us go.

1191
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:35,033
LIAM: We're going to be outlaws. We have to clear
ourselves by ending the charm on Uriel by

1192
01:27:35,033 --> 01:27:37,426
finishing off Sylas.

1193
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:42,062
SAM: Or by killing the Briarwoods, thus ending the
charm.

1194
01:27:42,062 --> 01:27:44,180
LIAM: Sylas Briarwood.

1195
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,290
MATT: "So that would be a way to clear your name
and clear his head."

1196
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:50,220
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

1197
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,791
SAM: Percival--

1198
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:55,260
ORION: What of eight days instead of two weeks?
Oh, sorry.

1199
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:04,320
SAM: Percival, what do you think we should do? Go
seek revenge on your family and get some blood on

1200
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:09,168
our hands, Briarwood blood? Or do the sneaky thing
and try to--

1201
01:28:09,168 --> 01:28:11,954
LAURA: Please, we need your input.

1202
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,502
MARISHA: You know them better than anyone.

1203
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:19,674
TALIESIN: I really don't. I think we're here
because I wasn't prepared.

1204
01:28:19,674 --> 01:28:23,853
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him? See if
he knows more than what he's saying?

1205
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:27,541
MATT: Sure.

1206
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:31,425
MARISHA: 19.

1207
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:35,778
MATT: You can go ahead and roll a d20.

1208
01:28:35,778 --> 01:28:41,320
MARISHA: Is that a nine?

1209
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,849
TALIESIN: Nine.

1210
01:28:42,849 --> 01:28:44,504
MATT: Is there anything you're holding back?

1211
01:28:44,504 --> 01:28:45,667
TALIESIN: Nope.

1212
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:48,286
MATT: He seems clear as day, telling the honest
truth.

1213
01:28:48,286 --> 01:28:56,078
LIAM: I don't think we're here in this city to
become lords and ladies serving Uriel, as good a

1214
01:28:56,078 --> 01:29:04,348
man he is. I think Percival's our ally, and this
is a grievous wrong done to him, and we can kill

1215
01:29:04,348 --> 01:29:06,607
two birds with one stone.

1216
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:11,978
TALIESIN: I think we are in the situation we're in
because we now know how much we don't know. How

1217
01:29:11,978 --> 01:29:20,208
much I don't know. I'm not prepared. If we face
them now, I'm going to get you all killed.

1218
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:26,000
ORION: I agree. We need proper preparation. Percy,
I'm pretty sure you have a good background on

1219
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,601
vampires and what-have-you, as do I, as I've
researched them in the last couple of days.

1220
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:35,490
There's other things that we should research, as
well, and probably arm ourselves for that kind of

1221
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,630
conflict, if it comes to it. Quite frankly, I have
a feeling if it's the whole town we're dealing

1222
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:45,969
with, we need to find out how many innocents there
are to save, and if the number is low enough, we

1223
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:53,392
can fly in with an army ourselves, which would
take some time. The Draconian Knights. I am an

1224
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:58,262
ambassador to Draconia, officially, after all the
assistance I've sent, in giving them the Wheel of

1225
01:29:58,262 --> 01:30:00,610
Mending, and proving my point.

1226
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:01,733
LAURA: You gave them the Wheel?

1227
01:30:01,733 --> 01:30:05,634
ORION: No, I showed it to them, proving that my
quest was true, which they gave me full

1228
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:12,080
ambassadorship, which means that, if harm comes to
a Stormwind, harm comes to all of Draconia. And a

1229
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,469
town full of vampires and liches--

1230
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:18,747
LAURA: I didn't know we had a whole army at our
disposal. That's wonderful to hear.

1231
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,985
ORION: If worse comes to worst.

1232
01:30:20,985 --> 01:30:24,227
LIAM: Started on the bottom, now we're here.

1233
01:30:24,227 --> 01:30:27,065
SAM: Diplomatic immunity.

1234
01:30:27,065 --> 01:30:35,502
ORION: Even then, our relations must be strong
with Emon. We need their allyship, as well.

1235
01:30:35,502 --> 01:30:39,532
Draconia will not go into things alone. We need a
union.

1236
01:30:39,532 --> 01:30:45,890
MARISHA: I agree. While we're not serving Uriel,
that's not our purpose, I also don't want to leave

1237
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:52,631
an enemy of the state. That's not good for me, for
what I want.

1238
01:30:52,631 --> 01:30:58,065
ORION: I go up to Jarett. Eight days. What do you
think of eight days?

1239
01:30:58,065 --> 01:31:03,838
MARISHA: And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett,
Asum.

1240
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:07,564
SAM: He's not even going where we would be going.
We would be going to Whitestone, right? That's

1241
01:31:07,564 --> 01:31:09,124
where the Briarwoods are.

1242
01:31:09,124 --> 01:31:13,176
LIAM: But Keyleth, Uriel is the law, and the law
is now corrupt.

1243
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:17,484
MARISHA: Then why don't we save his mind before we
go?

1244
01:31:17,484 --> 01:31:25,282
LAURA: Here's the thing. He's going to find out
stuff about the Briarwoods. What's the fucking

1245
01:31:25,282 --> 01:31:28,607
point of him going if we're just going to go
attack the Briarwoods before we know what he

1246
01:31:28,607 --> 01:31:34,275
knows? We need to let him go, find out his shit,
take care of Uriel, wait until he gets back, go

1247
01:31:34,275 --> 01:31:35,799
take out the Briarwoods--

1248
01:31:35,799 --> 01:31:39,516
ORION: As Vex is saying this, Tiberius is getting
a half-chub.

1249
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:42,884
TRAVIS and LAURA: A what?

1250
01:31:42,884 --> 01:31:44,996
TALIESIN: Well, that's just weird.

1251
01:31:44,996 --> 01:31:46,664
ORION: You can't see it because it's inside.

1252
01:31:46,664 --> 01:31:48,259
LIAM: Yes, but you said it out loud.

1253
01:31:48,259 --> 01:31:49,800
MATT: Anyway.

1254
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,328
ORION: I'm just saying.

1255
01:31:51,328 --> 01:31:53,650
SAM: It's a strategy boner?

1256
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:55,281
LIAM: It's a strategy chub, all right.

1257
01:31:55,281 --> 01:31:57,679
TALIESIN: I'm still weirded out.

1258
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,034
MARISHA: You've got to give context to those
things, man.

1259
01:32:01,034 --> 01:32:05,038
LIAM: It's an odd choice of words, but now 30
seconds later, I see what you mean

1260
01:32:05,038 --> 01:32:10,077
ORION: Sorry. Her brain. That's what I'm talking
about.

1261
01:32:10,077 --> 01:32:23,254
MATT: Asum says, "My getting to Wildemount is not
easy, nor is it safe. I cannot linger for long.

1262
01:32:23,254 --> 01:32:25,025
"Maybe a few days."

1263
01:32:25,025 --> 01:32:26,733
TALIESIN: How soon will you return?

1264
01:32:26,733 --> 01:32:35,746
MATT: "That depends on if I even return. Every spy
I've sent to seek information on the Briarwoods or

1265
01:32:35,746 --> 01:32:38,655
"to Whitestone has not come back."

1266
01:32:38,655 --> 01:32:47,062
ORION: (ripping noises) I'll give him two strips of
Scroll of Telescription. If any harm falls upon

1267
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:49,629
you, write on this. I explain what it does.

1268
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:52,313
MATT: Okay. How many of those do you have left, by
the way?

1269
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:56,227
ORION: I have 30 tickets left, so 28 now.

1270
01:32:56,227 --> 01:33:05,522
LIAM: I have another idea. Uriel said that-- he was
resistant, but he said that he would bring me in

1271
01:33:05,522 --> 01:33:14,317
to have his people check me out. Check out my
story. What if Keyleth and Scanlan rode in my

1272
01:33:14,317 --> 01:33:15,635
pockets--

1273
01:33:15,635 --> 01:33:17,273
SAM: I'm not that small.

1274
01:33:17,273 --> 01:33:20,018
LAURA: As roaches.

1275
01:33:20,018 --> 01:33:22,521
LIAM: You're pretty small. Just as mice.

1276
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:25,467
LAURA: Or bugs. Roly-polies!

1277
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:32,769
LIAM: Magic user's choice. Can you cast magic when
you're transformed?

1278
01:33:32,769 --> 01:33:34,378
SAM: No.

1279
01:33:34,378 --> 01:33:43,039
LAURA: So they'd have to pop out. Can you shrink
yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny?

1280
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:46,161
SAM: Are you asking me?

1281
01:33:46,161 --> 01:33:48,110
LAURA: Either of you.

1282
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:51,662
SAM: No, but I can shit on things. Yes?

1283
01:33:51,662 --> 01:33:55,451
ORION: Can you give the Seeker an inspiration
before he goes on an adventure?

1284
01:33:55,451 --> 01:33:59,846
SAM: It could last him 20 minutes, yes. Get him to
the docks, maybe.

1285
01:33:59,846 --> 01:34:08,457
LAURA: Seeker, what do you think? What was your
goal of coming here?

1286
01:34:08,457 --> 01:34:11,613
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want us to come with you or
what?

1287
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:18,664
MATT: "My journey requires the utmost of silence,
speed, stealth, and I mean no offense to your

1288
01:34:18,664 --> 01:34:27,377
"entourage, but I think I can do this alone, and
should. However, this journey may take me two

1289
01:34:27,377 --> 01:34:31,897
"weeks, a month, many months-- I do not know. I'm
doing this just in case whatever you're choosing

1290
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:38,804
"to do fails. At least, if Vox Machina falls in
this, I can come back with proof enough to try, and

1291
01:34:38,804 --> 01:34:45,235
"once the army has been gathered, perhaps we can
rally all of Emon against Whitestone."

1292
01:34:45,235 --> 01:34:50,372
TRAVIS: If you die, can you write a letter and
sign your name saying that we were right, you were

1293
01:34:50,372 --> 01:34:53,476
wrong, you were full of shit, the Briarwoods are
assholes--

1294
01:34:53,476 --> 01:34:55,851
ORION: But a lot more eloquently than that.

1295
01:34:55,851 --> 01:34:57,254
TRAVIS: Or not.

1296
01:34:57,254 --> 01:34:58,635
MATT: "I can try my best."

1297
01:34:58,635 --> 01:35:00,145
LAURA: That would be lovely.

1298
01:35:00,145 --> 01:35:14,669
MARISHA: I go up to his arm, and I Druidcraft a
wooden armband. Make it look cool. And put that on

1299
01:35:14,669 --> 01:35:15,669
him.

1300
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:16,913
SAM: Onto Tiberius?

1301
01:35:16,913 --> 01:35:18,476
MARISHA: No, onto Asum.

1302
01:35:18,476 --> 01:35:23,952
Now I can scry through that. That way I
can at least check in on you every once in a while.

1303
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:25,889
If you're okay with that?

1304
01:35:25,889 --> 01:35:28,473
SAM: I could've shat on him and had the same
effect.

1305
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,857
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1306
01:35:32,857 --> 01:35:40,946
LAURA: What about being invisible? Can you cast
spells while you're invisible?

1307
01:35:40,946 --> 01:35:46,081
ORION: Only with Greater Invisibility, you can.

1308
01:35:46,081 --> 01:35:47,484
MARISHA: 21.

1309
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:57,745
SAM: We've always sought out the path of the most
glory, and I think that that is the Briarwoods.

1310
01:35:57,745 --> 01:36:08,824
Going into a giant, vampire-lich-ridden castle and
killing two evil bastards amid their army of

1311
01:36:08,824 --> 01:36:11,560
protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do.

1312
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:16,246
LAURA: It's super-duper cool. Here's the thing:
it's not going to be just two, I don't think. It's

1313
01:36:16,246 --> 01:36:19,281
going to be an entire town of people that they've
controlled.

1314
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:24,797
SAM: You think we can get into Sovereign Uriel
without anyone detecting magic on us? He's got

1315
01:36:24,797 --> 01:36:27,087
clerics all round him--

1316
01:36:27,087 --> 01:36:29,856
LAURA: Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and
outs of the palace.

1317
01:36:29,856 --> 01:36:31,556
LIAM: He's leaving town tomorrow.

1318
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:34,055
LAURA: We'd have to do it stat, but he knows how
to get in.

1319
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:38,341
MARISHA: He did say it was an inspired idea. His
words.

1320
01:36:38,341 --> 01:36:44,795
MATT: "Regardless, you have to make a choice soon.
I cannot dilly-dally. I'll take your band, yes."

1321
01:36:44,795 --> 01:36:48,855
He takes the wooden band and puts it around his
arm and says, "If this will put you at ease, I'll

1322
01:36:48,855 --> 01:36:49,869
"take it."

1323
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:54,949
MARISHA: Don't worry. I won't abuse it, I promise.
Could you potentially help us with sneaking in the

1324
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:56,240
castle?

1325
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,848
MATT: "I could get you in the door, but I could
not escort you to that room. That would put myself

1326
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:02,394
"in extreme danger and the entirety of our
mission."

1327
01:37:02,394 --> 01:37:04,493
LAURA: Could you distract people?

1328
01:37:04,493 --> 01:37:08,067
MATT: (laughs) "I can do that quite well, yes."

1329
01:37:08,067 --> 01:37:13,943
SAM: We can get there, but something tells me
we're still going to be fighting a big fight in a

1330
01:37:13,943 --> 01:37:16,954
palace. I'd rather fight that big fight in the
Briarwoods'.

1331
01:37:16,954 --> 01:37:22,723
LIAM: Scanlan and I are in agreement, and here's
the problem. If things go south in Uriel's palace,

1332
01:37:22,723 --> 01:37:30,983
we are then forced to fight against people who are
good and true, or give up and go to jail, which

1333
01:37:30,983 --> 01:37:31,990
sucks.

1334
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:35,019
SAM: But in the Briarwoods', we can kill every
motherfucker in that place.

1335
01:37:35,019 --> 01:37:38,519
ORION: There are a number of innocents that we
need to figure out, still.

1336
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,088
MARISHA: What if we talk to Allura?

1337
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:42,534
SAM: You killed an old lady!

1338
01:37:42,534 --> 01:37:45,357
ORION: She attacked us! And I will not back down
from that decision.

1339
01:37:45,357 --> 01:37:47,714
SAM: She did have an old lady smell.

1340
01:37:47,714 --> 01:37:54,756
TRAVIS: All right. Can we just vote on something,
please? Since Percy's being oh-so-quiet about all

1341
01:37:54,756 --> 01:37:55,637
this.

1342
01:37:55,637 --> 01:37:57,230
MARISHA: Percy is being very quiet about this.

1343
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,726
TRAVIS: Are you sure you have nothing to say?

1344
01:37:59,726 --> 01:38:06,167
LAURA: It's fucking your family. It's the people
that attacked your family. Do you have no

1345
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:08,456
contribution to this?

1346
01:38:08,456 --> 01:38:21,527
TALIESIN: I still feel I owe everybody an apology.
I still feel terrible about dragging you all into

1347
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:23,413
this and putting you in danger.

1348
01:38:23,413 --> 01:38:25,854
LAURA: We're choosing to do it.

1349
01:38:25,854 --> 01:38:33,528
MATT: "Vengeance." A voice whispers in your ear,
Percy. No one hears this. "Vengeance."

1350
01:38:33,528 --> 01:38:45,468
TALIESIN: If you're with me, we can be prepared
for them this time. We know enough to prepare

1351
01:38:45,468 --> 01:38:48,438
ourselves, we can have ourselves ready this time.

1352
01:38:48,438 --> 01:38:54,614
ORION: How many days do we have? I would like
eight days to prepare.

1353
01:38:54,614 --> 01:38:57,272
MARISHA: Can I see if he looks like shaken or
fucked up at all?

1354
01:38:57,272 --> 01:39:01,770
MATT: I mean, he looks shaken and fucked up, yeah.
He's obviously had a horrible few days.

1355
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:04,450
TALIESIN: I think a week to prepare is
reasonable.

1356
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:05,637
LAURA: And then leave.

1357
01:39:05,637 --> 01:39:07,921
TALIESIN: And then we leave. We leave quietly.

1358
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:10,341
MARISHA: Wait, we're leaving to Whitestone?

1359
01:39:10,341 --> 01:39:12,753
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yes.

1360
01:39:12,753 --> 01:39:16,561
TALIESIN: I've been avoiding it for too long, and
now I know too much.

1361
01:39:16,561 --> 01:39:22,485
LIAM: The law of this land is compromised.
Percival, I agree with you. I think this is the

1362
01:39:22,485 --> 01:39:24,148
right choice.

1363
01:39:24,148 --> 01:39:26,275
TRAVIS: All in favor, say aye.

1364
01:39:26,275 --> 01:39:28,386
ALL (except Orion): Aye.

1365
01:39:28,386 --> 01:39:32,909
TRAVIS: All opposed, say nay. Nice.

1366
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:36,397
MATT: "Then it is settled. I'll be on my way."

1367
01:39:36,397 --> 01:39:39,395
LAURA: Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you?

1368
01:39:39,395 --> 01:39:41,641
MATT: "Certainly."

1369
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:45,606
LAURA: Were you going to say anything else?
Because I'll talk to you in private.

1370
01:39:45,606 --> 01:39:51,118
MATT: "Three days and I'll be off on my side of
the mission. Very well."

1371
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:52,701
LAURA: I'll follow you out.

1372
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:55,020
MATT: Yes, and he walks out, walks with you.

1373
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:02,385
TALIESIN: Hold on, I'm going to hold you before
you go. I just wanted to say, I'm so sorry and

1374
01:40:02,385 --> 01:40:09,067
thank you. And thank you for doing this for me. I
fear my temper before this weight is lifted from

1375
01:40:09,067 --> 01:40:17,126
my heart. I do not wish to lose myself like that
again, and I am so sorry for everything I've

1376
01:40:17,126 --> 01:40:18,685
done.

1377
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:25,074
ORION: Tiberius puts his hand on Percy's shoulder,
and go, I'm sorry for the tragedy which is your

1378
01:40:25,074 --> 01:40:31,143
family, and what these Briarwoods have befallen to
them, and I will promise you, I will do my best to

1379
01:40:31,143 --> 01:40:37,308
have you give that final blow from that barrel to
the names assigned to them. But now it is a far

1380
01:40:37,308 --> 01:40:39,812
dangerous situation, as you very well know.

1381
01:40:39,812 --> 01:40:44,341
TALIESIN: I will do my best to maintain myself. I
apologize.

1382
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:52,961
MATT: And as you all scatter, Percy, as you walk
out, the same voice creeps into your ear, "Yes."

1383
01:40:52,961 --> 01:41:01,110
Now, as you step out with Seeker Asum, who now has
a bit of haste to his step, arms crossed, looking

1384
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:04,164
around. "So you wish to speak with me?"

1385
01:41:04,164 --> 01:41:06,520
LAURA: Yes, I do. You're a ranger.

1386
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:07,954
MATT: "I am."

1387
01:41:07,954 --> 01:41:10,151
LAURA: You're very sneaky.

1388
01:41:10,151 --> 01:41:11,814
MATT: "I can be."

1389
01:41:11,814 --> 01:41:18,324
LAURA: I've only ever seen people like thieves,
like my brother, do things like you've done. Can

1390
01:41:18,324 --> 01:41:25,637
you teach me anything that you know to help me
maybe be a little more stealthy, as well?

1391
01:41:25,637 --> 01:41:32,568
MATT: (sighs) "We'll go over what you know, and
perhaps there are a few tricks that I can teach you

1392
01:41:32,568 --> 01:41:38,331
"in the three days I have. I can't guarantee that
it'll be extremely changing, as that's a very

1393
01:41:38,331 --> 01:41:42,236
"short time to train over what I've learned over a
lifetime, but I can certainly attempt."

1394
01:41:42,236 --> 01:41:43,769
LAURA: I appreciate it.

1395
01:41:43,769 --> 01:41:46,181
MATT: "I require your concentration for those
days, though, before I leave."

1396
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:47,556
LAURA: Utmost.

1397
01:41:47,556 --> 01:41:51,530
MATT: "All right. Meet me at the morrow, crack of
dawn. I'll be at the front of your keep."

1398
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,742
LAURA: Okay.

1399
01:41:52,742 --> 01:41:56,694
MATT: "Very well." And he heads off, outside of
the keep. The rest of you, what are you doing?

1400
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,182
ORION: I go to my laboratory.

1401
01:41:58,182 --> 01:41:59,778
MARISHA: What time is it?

1402
01:41:59,778 --> 01:42:01,745
MATT: About 3:00, 4:00 in the afternoon now.

1403
01:42:01,745 --> 01:42:05,210
TRAVIS: That temple of Sarenrae is in the city.

1404
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:09,781
MATT: It's part of the keep, yeah. Oh, you mean
the actual temple you went to? That is inside the

1405
01:42:09,781 --> 01:42:14,534
city, yes. You can go into the city; you just
can't get to the Cloudtop District.

1406
01:42:14,534 --> 01:42:18,641
ORION: Use the earring real quick. I'm going to
write a quick letter. If anybody goes shopping,

1407
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:19,778
let me know.

1408
01:42:19,778 --> 01:42:21,685
MATT: Tiberius loves shopping.

1409
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:23,666
LAURA: He really, really does.

1410
01:42:23,666 --> 01:42:26,681
MATT: All right, we'll go ahead and take a quick
break. We'll be back in five minutes. Keep it a

1411
01:42:26,681 --> 01:42:28,138
stringent break, guys.

1412
01:42:28,138 --> 01:42:31,378
LIAM: So errands will happen after that break?
Because I have some errands that I want to do.

1413
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:34,490
MATT: Yes. We'll try to keep the errands pretty
concise so we can keep on schedule, yeah, so it's

1414
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:37,494
like, use this break to conjecture exactly what
you want to do. All right, guys, we'll see you

1415
01:42:37,494 --> 01:42:39,127
back here in five minutes.

1416
01:42:39,127 --> 01:55:26,129
[break]

1417
01:55:26,129 --> 01:55:31,228
MATT: Welcome back. So to try and expedite this,
over the next period of time you guys want to take

1418
01:55:31,228 --> 01:55:34,238
to prepare, what are you going to do? Percy.

1419
01:55:34,238 --> 01:55:39,831
TALIESIN: I'm going to finish up those things that
we talked about earlier, spend some time making

1420
01:55:39,831 --> 01:55:47,225
some ammunition, and I'm going to attempt to build
what we were talking about earlier.

1421
01:55:47,225 --> 01:55:50,261
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check
for your ammunition.

1422
01:55:50,261 --> 01:55:54,600
MARISHA: What we were talking about? Can I help
him with that? Can I assist him?

1423
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:58,193
MATT: I would say the tinkering, the mechanisms
involved, would be so far beyond your

1424
01:55:58,193 --> 01:56:03,622
understanding as a druid. Even just metalwork in
general. You can cheer him on, but would not be

1425
01:56:03,622 --> 01:56:04,846
able to assist him with it.

1426
01:56:04,846 --> 01:56:08,022
MARISHA: Go Percy, go! That's pretty good.

1427
01:56:08,022 --> 01:56:09,449
TALIESIN: 24.

1428
01:56:09,449 --> 01:56:19,692
MATT: 24? Okay. You manage to produce 25 rounds
for your Pepperbox and ten rounds for the Bad

1429
01:56:19,692 --> 01:56:20,699
News.

1430
01:56:20,699 --> 01:56:22,927
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

1431
01:56:22,927 --> 01:56:26,896
MARISHA: You still have inspiration from Scanlan?

1432
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:28,908
TALIESIN: No, I used that.

1433
01:56:28,908 --> 01:56:48,288
MATT: Used that to repair his Pepperbox. Roll for
the secondary construction. Smoke bombs.

1434
01:56:48,288 --> 01:56:52,912
TALIESIN: Okay. 11.

1435
01:56:52,912 --> 01:57:01,663
MATT: 11. You take a better part of two days
attempting to get these to work, and most of your

1436
01:57:01,663 --> 01:57:05,925
materials are ruined, unfortunately. You manage to
come out with it with, and I want you to write

1437
01:57:05,925 --> 01:57:13,569
this down, "smoke bomb, question mark." It may
function. We will see upon use. But you have one

1438
01:57:13,569 --> 01:57:21,268
at your disposal that is questionable. However,
for the cost of the ammunition and the cost of the

1439
01:57:21,268 --> 01:57:27,371
smoke bomb's construction, already that comes to
about, I'd say 75 gold pieces, so mark that off.

1440
01:57:27,371 --> 01:57:35,916
And you're attempting to make, you're attempting
to make, based on what you told me, an Archimedes

1441
01:57:35,916 --> 01:57:37,071
death ray.

1442
01:57:37,071 --> 01:57:42,686
TALIESIN: They're not hard. I say that as, like,
knowing my actual skill level, I could make one.

1443
01:57:42,686 --> 01:57:47,234
MATT: You could. To be functional with the
materials that are at your disposal, it's going to

1444
01:57:47,234 --> 01:57:49,785
be very large and hard to move.

1445
01:57:49,785 --> 01:57:52,711
MARISHA: We were talking about making it
collapsible.

1446
01:57:52,711 --> 01:57:58,584
TALIESIN: I could make a collapsible one, where
it's basically a one-third dodecahedron, like an

1447
01:57:58,584 --> 01:57:59,920
observatory.

1448
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:07,111
MATT: You spend the remainder of this week of
preparation. Go ahead and roll your tinkering

1449
01:58:07,111 --> 01:58:10,861
check. This is going to cost you in materials.

1450
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:16,428
ORION: Wait, hold on, can I pause real quick? You
don't need to do this if you want to make more

1451
01:58:16,428 --> 01:58:20,992
ammo and other stuff. I can do this without you
making this and spending the rest of the time, if

1452
01:58:20,992 --> 01:58:24,304
you want to make other stuff. Option.

1453
01:58:24,304 --> 01:58:26,759
MATT: What do you want to do?

1454
01:58:26,759 --> 01:58:29,920
TALIESIN: Story-wise it's more amusing.

1455
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:32,723
MATT: Okay, go for it. All right, so. The actual
materials for this--

1456
01:58:32,723 --> 01:58:34,281
TALIESIN: It's copper.

1457
01:58:34,281 --> 01:58:39,078
MATT: I know, it's copper, but the actual
dodecahedron that's involved, the mirrors, the

1458
01:58:39,078 --> 01:58:43,255
lenses, the whole thing? In order to be of the
scale and quality to even make it even remotely

1459
01:58:43,255 --> 01:58:47,520
functional, all of it for the extremely high
quality and some of it custom-made within

1460
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,528
the first couple days within this, with a rush
order. I'd say the total cost is going to come to

1461
01:58:51,528 --> 01:58:53,512
about 1,200 gold pieces.

1462
01:58:53,512 --> 01:58:56,246
MARISHA: I'll pitch in for that. How much do you
have?

1463
01:58:56,246 --> 01:58:59,081
TALIESIN: At this point I have less than 100
gold.

1464
01:58:59,081 --> 01:59:01,409
MARISHA: You have less than 100 gold? I'll pay for
it in full.

1465
01:59:01,409 --> 01:59:03,384
ORION: What is the diameter of this?

1466
01:59:03,384 --> 01:59:11,918
MATT: The actual focal lens is about this big. The
whole construct can be carried by two people.

1467
01:59:11,918 --> 01:59:15,054
TALIESIN: But it will fold.

1468
01:59:15,054 --> 01:59:22,262
ORION: I was just going to say, what's the radius
of the actual thing's lens?

1469
01:59:22,262 --> 01:59:26,453
MATT: Of the lens itself? This is the radius of
the lens. I mean, even when it's collapsed, it can

1470
01:59:26,453 --> 01:59:29,680
be carried by one person, but it's still a heavy
mechanism.

1471
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,324
ORION: So it's only one foot? Two feet? Three
feet?

1472
01:59:32,324 --> 01:59:35,372
MATT: I'd say it's about two and a half feet in
diameter.

1473
01:59:35,372 --> 01:59:38,210
ORION: Are you sure you want to do that?

1474
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:40,197
MATT: He's already agreed. Go ahead and roll.

1475
01:59:40,197 --> 01:59:43,360
MARISHA: Why? It's fine. This is what we were
talking about.

1476
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,844
TALIESIN: 22.

1477
01:59:47,844 --> 02:00:02,189
MATT: 22. Through the materials and the construct
of it, you get partway through the final stages of

1478
02:00:02,189 --> 02:00:07,822
it, and as you're tightening one of the sections,
all of a sudden there's a (cracking) sound. Your

1479
02:00:07,822 --> 02:00:11,226
whole body freezes as you glance over. the lens
itself has a giant crack through it.

1480
02:00:11,226 --> 02:00:14,264
TALIESIN: There shouldn't be a glass piece-- aw,
man.

1481
02:00:14,264 --> 02:00:20,936
MATT: For the construct for this one, there was a
focusing lens that is part of what the initial

1482
02:00:20,936 --> 02:00:24,217
blast, otherwise there wouldn't be a point of
actually projecting a ray from.

1483
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,354
ORION: I thought they were all mirrors.

1484
02:00:26,354 --> 02:00:30,282
MATT: There's all different sorts of construction
based on. This one's the one we're going on here,

1485
02:00:30,282 --> 02:00:33,695
or if you can say the center of it is a gem, but
regardless, the tinkering roll was not high enough

1486
02:00:33,695 --> 02:00:37,170
to construct the device. Sorry.

1487
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:42,293
MARISHA: The whole thing's wasted? Can we try and
repair the crack?

1488
02:00:42,293 --> 02:00:47,994
MATT: It's not something you can repair. The
entire piece is constructed from a solid piece.

1489
02:00:47,994 --> 02:00:50,517
TALIESIN: What, could we put it on the Mending
Wheel?

1490
02:00:50,517 --> 02:00:52,604
MATT: You could attempt to.

1491
02:00:52,604 --> 02:00:59,122
ORION: (grunting) Let's see. Okay. (clicking
noise)

1492
02:00:59,122 --> 02:01:06,635
TRAVIS: I want to go to the store. I would like to
get a shovel and a pickaxe.

1493
02:01:06,635 --> 02:01:08,827
ORION: You going to Gilmore's? We're going to
Gilmore's, too. We could go together if you're

1494
02:01:08,827 --> 02:01:09,970
doing that.

1495
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,815
TRAVIS: I don't give a fuck where we go. Just a
shovel and a pickaxe.

1496
02:01:12,815 --> 02:01:25,072
MATT: Pickaxe... comes to four gold pieces for
the two of those. You got them. Make a secondary

1497
02:01:25,072 --> 02:01:27,387
tinkering check.

1498
02:01:27,387 --> 02:01:32,288
TALIESIN: 22.

1499
02:01:32,288 --> 02:01:39,345
MATT: 22. This time you go back and as you're
tightening it, the actual metal housing of the

1500
02:01:39,345 --> 02:01:45,843
device ends up bending in a way that both cracks
the gem and causes the frame itself to be dented to

1501
02:01:45,843 --> 02:01:51,991
the point where the beam will be imperfect. This
is a very hard thing that you've come up with in

1502
02:01:51,991 --> 02:01:56,193
your mind that has not been constructed before,
and the level of difficulty to create this is very

1503
02:01:56,193 --> 02:02:00,532
difficult. It does not cost you additional money,
thanks to the Mending Wheel, but right now the

1504
02:02:00,532 --> 02:02:07,448
entire device looks like to continue, it's going
to take more time and money to construct it.

1505
02:02:07,448 --> 02:02:12,339
TALIESIN: (sighs) I can always use this for spare
parts for other things.

1506
02:02:12,339 --> 02:02:16,664
LAURA: You're already 1,200 in? How much more
would you have to put in?

1507
02:02:16,664 --> 02:02:19,293
MATT: I'd say about half the cost. An additional 600.

1508
02:02:19,293 --> 02:02:22,429
MARISHA: And how many more days?

1509
02:02:22,429 --> 02:02:23,880
MATT: Two more days.

1510
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:26,304
MARISHA: How many more days do we have?

1511
02:02:26,304 --> 02:02:30,861
MATT: You agreed upon eight, so we'd be pushing
about seven, then.

1512
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:36,439
TALIESIN: I've already built a smoke bomb and
some rounds of bullets. All right, I'll put a

1513
02:02:36,529 --> 02:02:39,246
little more time in this. Can I get some
inspiration for this, too, if that would be

1514
02:02:39,246 --> 02:02:40,561
possible?

1515
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:42,400
LIAM: Music, you mean?

1516
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,304
MARISHA: There's nothing I can do to help him?

1517
02:02:44,304 --> 02:02:46,796
MATT: Unfortunately-- what's your intellect?

1518
02:02:46,796 --> 02:02:52,776
MARISHA: My intellect? I've got plus three.

1519
02:02:52,776 --> 02:02:56,999
SAM: (singing) Here comes the sun--

1520
02:02:56,999 --> 02:03:04,474
ALL: (singing) It's all right. (vocalizing)

1521
02:03:04,474 --> 02:03:06,132
LIAM: (singing) Kill the vampire.

1522
02:03:06,132 --> 02:03:10,852
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Come on, come on.

1523
02:03:10,852 --> 02:03:14,621
MARISHA: Percy roll. Come on.

1524
02:03:14,621 --> 02:03:17,883
TALIESIN: 23?

1525
02:03:17,883 --> 02:03:28,168
MATT: Working on the device a third time, you get
it right to the point where you think it could

1526
02:03:28,168 --> 02:03:32,995
work and you go to set it up, and as you do, you
find that the light focuses in a way that actually

1527
02:03:32,995 --> 02:03:37,662
slowly melts the copper on the outside of the
housing of the device, and it begins to melt onto

1528
02:03:37,662 --> 02:03:43,646
itself, and you have to pull it out of the light.
This design is beyond your grasp right now. You're

1529
02:03:43,646 --> 02:03:50,062
inventing something that takes quite a lot of time
to eventually perfect.

1530
02:03:50,062 --> 02:04:02,081
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to put these away for a
later time, and if I have one more day, I would

1531
02:04:02,081 --> 02:04:03,963
like to work on--

1532
02:04:03,963 --> 02:04:07,896
MARISHA: Maybe a version of it that is not
collapsible that we can at least mount?

1533
02:04:07,896 --> 02:04:10,568
TALIESIN: We've got it taken care of.

1534
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:12,146
MATT: That's been your guys' week.

1535
02:04:12,146 --> 02:04:13,620
TALIESIN: That's my week, okay.

1536
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:19,010
MATT: Okay. You bought your pickaxe and your
shovel. Cool. Vex, what are you doing?

1537
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:20,361
LAURA: I'm training.

1538
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:22,122
MATT: You're training, okay.

1539
02:04:22,122 --> 02:04:25,974
LIAM: All right. I want to be brief. I have four
things I want to do, but I'll be very brief. I

1540
02:04:25,974 --> 02:04:31,723
promise. Okay, so first thing I want to do is I
think at some point, I heard Tiberius talking about

1541
02:04:31,723 --> 02:04:36,973
wooden stakes and vampires. So I want to go buy
about ten wooden stakes.

1542
02:04:36,973 --> 02:04:38,678
ORION: I give him extra. Get me 20.

1543
02:04:38,678 --> 02:04:40,851
LIAM: I'm going shopping.

1544
02:04:40,851 --> 02:04:42,971
LAURA: Yes, get me some holy arrows.

1545
02:04:42,971 --> 02:04:50,322
LIAM: Can I get a loaner on that? I've got about
230 gold.

1546
02:04:50,322 --> 02:04:52,978
TRAVIS: I thought you said you were going to be
brief. (laughs)

1547
02:04:52,978 --> 02:04:54,877
LIAM: On my own.

1548
02:04:54,877 --> 02:04:57,306
MARISHA: I thought we got a bit of an allowance.

1549
02:04:57,306 --> 02:05:04,195
LIAM: It's a week, so I get some gold from these
people and I go and I don't even know what they

1550
02:05:04,195 --> 02:05:06,915
said. I'm getting ten wooden stakes for myself.

1551
02:05:06,915 --> 02:05:12,584
MATT: 20, technically, because Tiberius requested
ten. Those will cost you a total of two gold.

1552
02:05:12,584 --> 02:05:14,991
LIAM: That's what I thought. And what did you
want?

1553
02:05:14,991 --> 02:05:16,722
LAURA: I wanted some holy arrows.

1554
02:05:16,722 --> 02:05:18,080
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1555
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:21,584
LAURA: Or holy water. Try to get some holy water.
Holy oil.

1556
02:05:21,584 --> 02:05:27,884
LIAM: I'll get to that. Investigation, you say?
That is a 13.

1557
02:05:27,884 --> 02:05:37,122
MATT: 13. Asking around the town: holy arrows,
that is an enchantment. They're pricey and they

1558
02:05:37,122 --> 02:05:40,858
don't appear to be anywhere in the major shops,
even shops like Gilmore's, that they specialize

1559
02:05:40,858 --> 02:05:49,520
in. It's usually a special order-type thing. Holy
water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece.

1560
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:53,914
LIAM: I'll get to that. All right, so we got wood.
That was two gold, you said. All right, minus two.

1561
02:05:53,914 --> 02:06:07,181
The next thing I want to do is go to the temple of
Sarenrae and get my sister's holy oil for her. How

1562
02:06:07,181 --> 02:06:08,691
much is that?

1563
02:06:08,691 --> 02:06:11,212
MATT: Holy oil? As opposed to the holy water?

1564
02:06:11,212 --> 02:06:13,844
LIAM: I'll take both, if you've got it.

1565
02:06:13,844 --> 02:06:19,354
MATT: Well, holy oil is a more expensive version.
Holy water is a one-use. Holy oil can be applied

1566
02:06:19,354 --> 02:06:20,718
to a weapon.

1567
02:06:20,718 --> 02:06:24,296
LIAM: Holy oil.

1568
02:06:24,296 --> 02:06:26,087
ORION: How much do the stakes weigh? Like each
stake?

1569
02:06:26,087 --> 02:06:32,697
MATT: A cluster of ten, if that's what you wanted,
would weigh about five pounds. But they're

1570
02:06:32,697 --> 02:06:34,573
relatively light.

1571
02:06:34,573 --> 02:06:36,879
ORION: Tell him that he bought me 20 more.

1572
02:06:36,879 --> 02:06:39,192
SAM: Tell him that he bought you?

1573
02:06:39,192 --> 02:06:51,847
LIAM: 40 stakes, four gold. Totally happened. Then
I went to the temple of Sarenrae and I got two

1574
02:06:51,847 --> 02:06:54,515
vials of holy oil. One for my sister, one for me.

1575
02:06:54,515 --> 02:06:56,205
MATT: Those are 100 gold apiece.

1576
02:06:56,205 --> 02:07:02,322
LIAM: Okay. Got it. I can't. Oh, you gave me gold.
I'll get four vials of that.

1577
02:07:02,322 --> 02:07:04,569
LAURA: Yeah, I gave him gold to do it.

1578
02:07:04,569 --> 02:07:14,163
LIAM: We'll work that out, I promise. I ask if the
cleric who helped bring Pike back to life is

1579
02:07:14,163 --> 02:07:15,497
here.

1580
02:07:15,497 --> 02:07:17,221
MATT: Yeah, Tristan is here.

1581
02:07:17,221 --> 02:07:18,878
LIAM: Jesus, how do you do that?

1582
02:07:18,878 --> 02:07:20,323
MATT: Because I have to.

1583
02:07:20,323 --> 02:07:27,654
LIAM: When I find him I say, you remember my
friend Pike? You remember me?

1584
02:07:27,654 --> 02:07:32,011
MATT: "Yes, I inspected you. Is that healing well,
by the way?" He inspects the wounds on the side of

1585
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:32,991
your neck.

1586
02:07:32,991 --> 02:07:41,382
LIAM: It is. I'm grateful. I need a keepsake of
your deity.

1587
02:07:41,382 --> 02:08:15,595
[no audio]

1588
02:08:15,595 --> 02:08:20,528
MATT: And he steps away, goes back, disappears for
a minute, comes back and he's holding in a chain

1589
02:08:20,528 --> 02:08:28,790
around his neck-- It's seen some years of use, but
still clean and very well kept, an identical holy

1590
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:32,718
symbol of Sarenrae as the one that Pike keeps
around her neck. He hands it over and puts it over

1591
02:08:32,718 --> 02:08:38,412
your head. "May she keep you safe and bring your
soul to redemption."

1592
02:08:38,412 --> 02:08:40,760
LIAM: It reminds me of my friend.

1593
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:43,730
MATT: "As it should." Pats you on the cheek. "As
it should."

1594
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:52,035
LIAM: All right, so chore number two down. I would
like to go to Uriel's temple and ask the guards if

1595
02:08:52,035 --> 02:08:55,124
anyone has seen my belt, Simon.

1596
02:08:55,124 --> 02:08:59,483
MATT: You are stopped at the edge of the Cloudtop
District. The guards see you as you approach and

1597
02:08:59,483 --> 02:09:03,843
block the doorway and say, "We're sorry, but
Vox Machina has been given no passage into the

1598
02:09:03,843 --> 02:09:05,974
"Cloudtop District at this time."

1599
02:09:05,974 --> 02:09:11,782
LIAM: I understand. I don't mean to go in. I
understand that we caused a lot of trouble, and I

1600
02:09:11,782 --> 02:09:20,655
am very sorry, and I don't mean to be any further
trouble. There is a belt that I left inside.

1601
02:09:20,655 --> 02:09:25,287
MATT: "That's certainly unfortunate, isn't it?"

1602
02:09:25,287 --> 02:09:29,276
LIAM: Have you seen a snake called Simon? Or any
snake?

1603
02:09:29,276 --> 02:09:35,250
MATT: Both the guards look at each other and laugh
for a second. "Piss off."

1604
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:37,890
LIAM: Okay. Chore number four.

1605
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:41,091
(laughter)

1606
02:09:41,091 --> 02:09:48,632
LIAM: I go back. I give everybody their things. I
would like to spend the rest of the week, because

1607
02:09:48,632 --> 02:10:02,519
I am ready, hanging out across the road from the
butcher's house that Kynan ran from, and if there

1608
02:10:02,519 --> 02:10:16,872
are any youths his age who go there to shop, I
would like to ask as they leave if they have any

1609
02:10:16,872 --> 02:10:19,189
idea where he's gone.

1610
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:24,018
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1611
02:10:24,018 --> 02:10:34,024
LIAM: Perception check. Oh, that's a seven.
Thought it was a one. (laughs) That is a 17.

1612
02:10:34,024 --> 02:10:38,221
MATT: 17. Okay. Keeping an eye out, you do
eventually come across a boy that looks about his

1613
02:10:38,221 --> 02:10:43,640
age. Late teens, maybe early twenties. Comes by
and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off

1614
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,850
and you stop him.

1615
02:10:44,850 --> 02:10:50,262
LIAM: Excuse me, I'm sorry to take you away from your
day. I'm sorry, what is your name?

1616
02:10:50,262 --> 02:10:52,043
MATT: "Jameson."

1617
02:10:52,043 --> 02:10:53,156
LIAM: Jameson.

1618
02:10:53,156 --> 02:10:56,086
MATT: "Yeah, can I help you? I've really got to get
home with this."

1619
02:10:56,086 --> 02:11:02,040
LIAM: I understand, I'll just take a second of
your time. I owe a boy who lives here named Kynan,

1620
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:08,649
I owe him a few silver and I want to see that he
gets it. Is he in town?

1621
02:11:08,649 --> 02:11:10,256
MATT: Make a deception check.

1622
02:11:10,256 --> 02:11:18,266
LIAM: I'll use the meteorite. That's a 15.

1623
02:11:18,266 --> 02:11:26,755
MATT: 15, gives you a look over and goes, "I'm
certain you've given him silver, but Kynan's been gone

1624
02:11:26,755 --> 02:11:28,256
"for the better part of a week."

1625
02:11:28,256 --> 02:11:29,977
LIAM: Where would he have gone?

1626
02:11:29,977 --> 02:11:33,867
MATT: "I don't know. He just told us all he
was off to find his destiny or some sort of

1627
02:11:33,867 --> 02:11:37,791
"bullshit like that. He's always had his head in
the clouds, that one."

1628
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:43,107
LIAM: I agree. He ever talked about where he was
going, how he meant to go about doing it?

1629
02:11:43,107 --> 02:11:50,071
MATT: "No, kept to himself mostly. Sorry, I wish I
could be more of a service. If I see him, where

1630
02:11:50,071 --> 02:11:52,435
"should I send him?"

1631
02:11:52,435 --> 02:11:56,184
(clattering)

1632
02:11:56,184 --> 02:12:05,688
LIAM: I don't know who that guy is. If you see
him, tell him that V. is looking for him at

1633
02:12:05,688 --> 02:12:07,354
Greyskull Keep.

1634
02:12:07,354 --> 02:12:09,200
MATT: "Well, I'll pass that along."

1635
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,293
LIAM: Thank you.

1636
02:12:10,293 --> 02:12:14,662
MATT: "Good day," and he hurries off to continue
with his errand.

1637
02:12:14,662 --> 02:12:16,623
LIAM: Are you all right, old man?

1638
02:12:16,623 --> 02:12:18,390
TRAVIS: (old-man voice) I'm fine. It's my knee.

1639
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:20,751
(laughter)

1640
02:12:20,751 --> 02:12:21,862
MATT: Is that your last errand?

1641
02:12:21,862 --> 02:12:22,703
LIAM: That's it.

1642
02:12:22,703 --> 02:12:23,859
MATT: Scanlan.

1643
02:12:23,859 --> 02:12:25,500
SAM: I go to Gilmore's. Are we near Gilmore's?

1644
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,713
MATT: Yeah, Gilmore's in the city. He's not in the
Cloudtop, so you have access to him still.

1645
02:12:28,713 --> 02:12:36,314
SAM: I want to know if such a thing exists, and if
so, how much. A potion or a scroll that could

1646
02:12:36,314 --> 02:12:40,695
invoke either Hallow or Spirit Guardians.

1647
02:12:40,695 --> 02:12:45,777
TALIESIN: Say what?

1648
02:12:45,777 --> 02:12:57,061
SAM: Spirit Guardians is four. Hallow is five.

1649
02:12:57,061 --> 02:13:11,181
MATT: Here we go. Okay. Asking around, there are
no potions for it, but there is a Scroll of Hallow

1650
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:21,020
available, and I will say that comes to roughly
6,000 gold pieces for the Scroll of Hallow.

1651
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:24,920
MARISHA: It's how much?

1652
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:31,797
MATT: 6,000 for the Hallow Scroll. And for the
Spirit Guardian, you said it was? 4th-level?

1653
02:13:31,797 --> 02:13:33,003
SAM: 4th-level.

1654
02:13:33,003 --> 02:13:34,545
MATT: That one is 2,000 gold.

1655
02:13:34,545 --> 02:13:37,677
LAURA: What does that do?

1656
02:13:37,677 --> 02:13:46,268
SAM: Spirit Guardians would make some beings
around us.

1657
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:52,532
MATT: Spirit Guardians is level three, actually,
not level four. That makes it a lot cheaper. That

1658
02:13:52,532 --> 02:13:54,290
is 600 gold.

1659
02:13:54,290 --> 02:13:59,514
SAM: It scares evil things away. It's like a
Pike-y thing.

1660
02:13:59,514 --> 02:14:01,044
LAURA: Do it.

1661
02:14:01,044 --> 02:14:08,646
SAM: Can I cast that if I have a scroll?

1662
02:14:08,646 --> 02:14:11,406
MATT: If you have a scroll you can, yeah. It has a
chance of failing.

1663
02:14:11,406 --> 02:14:15,463
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to have magic.

1664
02:14:15,463 --> 02:14:18,251
SAM: How much did you say?

1665
02:14:18,251 --> 02:14:19,264
MATT: 600 gold pieces.

1666
02:14:19,264 --> 02:14:20,631
SAM: I'll buy one of those.

1667
02:14:20,631 --> 02:14:23,108
MATT: There's only one available. So you mark that
down.

1668
02:14:23,108 --> 02:14:33,337
SAM: Okay. Yes, I will. I would also like to find
a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal

1669
02:14:33,337 --> 02:14:36,428
choker of chainmail.

1670
02:14:36,428 --> 02:14:44,671
MATT: Okay, remembering that you have spoken to
Karin before, which is the renowned custom

1671
02:14:44,671 --> 02:14:52,357
blacksmith in Emon, you speak with her. A
chainmail half coif around the neck there is

1672
02:14:52,357 --> 02:14:57,099
relatively inexpensive. It's a partial piece of
armor. She looks at some scrap chainmail on the

1673
02:14:57,099 --> 02:15:00,386
side and is like: "I'd be more than happy to use
that for it. It shouldn't me take more than an hour,

1674
02:15:00,386 --> 02:15:01,642
"two maybe at most."

1675
02:15:01,642 --> 02:15:02,894
LAURA: Get one for everyone.

1676
02:15:02,894 --> 02:15:05,295
TRAVIS: I think they can bite besides the neck,
right?

1677
02:15:05,295 --> 02:15:07,338
LAURA: Yeah, technically, but still!

1678
02:15:07,338 --> 02:15:11,267
SAM: (laughs) Sure, I'll get eight of them, or
seven of them.

1679
02:15:11,267 --> 02:15:14,152
MATT: Okay. (laughs) All right.

1680
02:15:14,152 --> 02:15:15,518
SAM: How much are they?

1681
02:15:15,518 --> 02:15:18,831
MATT: Seven of those. I'd say for the whole seven
it'd put you at 100 gold, because it's custom

1682
02:15:18,831 --> 02:15:21,106
orders. Seven of those.

1683
02:15:21,106 --> 02:15:22,827
LIAM: What are they?

1684
02:15:22,827 --> 02:15:25,032
SAM: Chainmail chokers

1685
02:15:25,032 --> 02:15:26,453
MARISHA: Chainmail dickies.

1686
02:15:26,453 --> 02:15:29,514
TRAVIS: Oh wait, do you have one more?

1687
02:15:29,514 --> 02:15:34,346
SAM: And a small one for my dick.

1688
02:15:34,346 --> 02:15:36,938
(laughter)

1689
02:15:36,938 --> 02:15:37,866
MATT: All righty.

1690
02:15:37,866 --> 02:15:38,854
SAM: A tiny one.

1691
02:15:38,854 --> 02:15:46,569
MATT: She awkwardly judges and turns that request
down. She's uncomfortable with that.

1692
02:15:46,569 --> 02:15:49,581
SAM: Then I bow and leave.

1693
02:15:49,581 --> 02:15:55,200
MATT: Okay. So you got that. Yes. Just a second
there, Tiberius.

1694
02:15:55,200 --> 02:16:01,721
LIAM: I go to Gilmore's Glorious Goods and ask at
the front door if Gilmore is there.

1695
02:16:01,721 --> 02:16:07,257
MATT: Gilmore, unfortunately, is in Westruun
currently. Still overseeing the construction of

1696
02:16:07,257 --> 02:16:08,860
his expansion there.

1697
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:13,403
LIAM: Understood. Who's the most knowledgeable
person next to Gilmore in this store right now?

1698
02:16:13,403 --> 02:16:34,532
MATT: That would be... I can't find my
updated NPC sheet. Do you remember what her name

1699
02:16:34,532 --> 02:16:35,434
was?

1700
02:16:35,434 --> 02:16:36,317
MARISHA: Sherri.

1701
02:16:36,317 --> 02:16:42,150
MATT: Sherri, thank you. I was like, Shelby? No.
Sherri. Sherri is there greeting you. "That would

1702
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:43,876
"probably be me."

1703
02:16:43,876 --> 02:16:50,018
LIAM: Oh, hi. You remember me. I have a very
important question. I won't take up much of your

1704
02:16:50,018 --> 02:16:59,099
time. I pull out a small metal skull cap. Dented
in a few places, rusted a bit, from the Underdark.

1705
02:16:59,099 --> 02:17:03,690
What can you tell me about this?

1706
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:10,540
MATT: She takes it. "If you're requesting
identification of a magical item, that is a

1707
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:12,257
"service we charge."

1708
02:17:12,257 --> 02:17:16,923
LIAM: Sis, can I borrow some money?

1709
02:17:16,923 --> 02:17:19,672
LAURA: How much do you need?

1710
02:17:19,672 --> 02:17:22,096
LIAM: How much would that require?

1711
02:17:22,096 --> 02:17:24,777
MATT: "125 gold pieces per enchantment
identified."

1712
02:17:24,777 --> 02:17:25,737
LIAM: Done.

1713
02:17:25,737 --> 02:17:26,639
MATT: "All right."

1714
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:27,876
LAURA: Talk her down.

1715
02:17:27,876 --> 02:17:31,615
MATT: She takes it. She steps inside, sets it on
the counter. She starts going through her books

1716
02:17:31,615 --> 02:17:37,432
and starts looking at it and holding it for a
second and doing a full inspection of it. "Based

1717
02:17:37,432 --> 02:17:44,538
"on the enchantment on this device, it's very crude
in construction and the enchantment is in an

1718
02:17:44,538 --> 02:17:49,998
"arcane offshoot of language I'm not very familiar
with, but it appears it is a guard from some sort

1719
02:17:49,998 --> 02:17:57,801
"of a mental influence. If worn, it would give you
a stronger resistance against things that would

1720
02:17:57,801 --> 02:18:00,706
"attempt to peer into your mind."

1721
02:18:00,706 --> 02:18:04,059
LIAM: Are we talking magic?

1722
02:18:04,059 --> 02:18:08,497
MATT: "Yes." So essentially what it would do is it
would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws

1723
02:18:08,497 --> 02:18:10,097
against magic spells.

1724
02:18:10,097 --> 02:18:11,215
LIAM: Against?

1725
02:18:11,215 --> 02:18:15,445
MATT: It would give you advantage on wisdom saving
throws against magical effects.

1726
02:18:15,445 --> 02:18:24,704
LIAM: That's fucking brilliant. I hand her the
gold and say, Scanlan sends his regards.

1727
02:18:24,704 --> 02:18:34,019
MATT: She noticeably blushes and goes, "Well, send
mine back if you wouldn't mind. I've got work to

1728
02:18:34,019 --> 02:18:35,513
"do." And she rushes off.

1729
02:18:35,513 --> 02:18:37,104
LIAM: Thank you.

1730
02:18:37,104 --> 02:18:39,418
MATT: All right. Now, Tiberius.

1731
02:18:39,418 --> 02:18:42,432
SAM: 16 errands.

1732
02:18:42,432 --> 02:18:51,444
ORION: I only have eight. Just kidding, no. The
real quick one is going to the Temple of

1733
02:18:51,444 --> 02:18:52,915
Sarenrae to pick up a canteen.

1734
02:18:52,915 --> 02:18:59,172
MATT: Okay. Did you pay for it already? You paid
up front. Okay. So you get the canteen, the

1735
02:18:59,172 --> 02:19:07,917
explanation is: the enchantment of the actual
water creation itself is separate than the holy

1736
02:19:07,917 --> 02:19:11,491
enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy
enchantment is not very powerful because it is an

1737
02:19:11,491 --> 02:19:17,221
enchanted item. How it functions is the first
burst per day that you use of the water does an

1738
02:19:17,221 --> 02:19:21,528
additional 1d6 radiant damage. That's it. But any
additional after that is just water. Basically,

1739
02:19:21,528 --> 02:19:27,087
whatever water is immediately contained within it
at the start of the day is considered blessed.

1740
02:19:27,087 --> 02:19:30,408
Once that's expelled, all the rest that it
creates-- because it's pulling it out of the

1741
02:19:30,408 --> 02:19:34,186
elemental plane of water; that's how it's
continuously projecting it. The rest of it runs

1742
02:19:34,186 --> 02:19:38,247
straight through, so it doesn't have a chance to
even absorb the blessing.

1743
02:19:38,247 --> 02:19:48,603
ORION: Gotcha. Okay, cool. Second thing. I drop
off my Swallow, or I'll call it the surge blade,

1744
02:19:48,603 --> 02:19:53,299
and to have that enchanted on both ends.

1745
02:19:53,299 --> 02:19:54,518
MATT: With?

1746
02:19:54,518 --> 02:20:01,876
ORION: One side fire, the other side water. So
however many mages I have to hire for that to

1747
02:20:01,876 --> 02:20:05,484
happen in ten days, I think we talked about it
being eight days or something like that? Or was

1748
02:20:05,484 --> 02:20:07,565
that only one side?

1749
02:20:07,565 --> 02:20:15,058
MATT: (laughs) So what enchantment do you want? Do
you want to just do an additional-- What do you

1750
02:20:15,058 --> 02:20:16,278
want it to be?

1751
02:20:16,278 --> 02:20:18,313
ORION: I just want it to be a magical weapon.

1752
02:20:18,313 --> 02:20:25,229
MATT: Just a magical weapon? Okay, just a general
plus-one magical weapon. Okay. That would take

1753
02:20:25,229 --> 02:20:35,238
about-- let me double-check the rarity here.

1754
02:20:35,238 --> 02:20:44,247
SAM: In the meantime, check out those Critical
Role keychains available on Geek and Sundry.

1755
02:20:44,247 --> 02:20:46,389
(laughter)

1756
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:53,919
MATT: That would run you approximately 700 gold to
create it as a plus-one magical item. Would take

1757
02:20:53,919 --> 02:20:55,885
one mage a week to do it.

1758
02:20:55,885 --> 02:20:59,362
ORION: Okay. So I'll do that.

1759
02:20:59,362 --> 02:21:07,047
MATT: Okay, so for the week it takes, you pay
700 gold pieces. Your quarterstaff with a

1760
02:21:07,047 --> 02:21:13,086
couple of daggers tied to the end is now
considered a plus-one magical weapon.

1761
02:21:13,086 --> 02:21:18,214
(laughter)

1762
02:21:18,214 --> 02:21:29,413
ORION: I stop at Gilmore's and I drop off my Ring
of Protection. And pay whatever that is to add a

1763
02:21:29,413 --> 02:21:33,661
plus-one to make it instead of a minor, an actual
Ring of Protection.

1764
02:21:33,661 --> 02:21:38,456
MATT: Unfortunately, the thing is, an enchantment
cannot be progressively enhanced. You would

1765
02:21:38,456 --> 02:21:41,136
have to disenchant and then re-enchant the entire
thing.

1766
02:21:41,136 --> 02:21:44,172
ORION: I thought Gilmore said they could do that
there, before. That's why I was going to cough up

1767
02:21:44,172 --> 02:21:46,878
the green for the Gil, as it were.

1768
02:21:46,878 --> 02:21:52,097
MATT: No. They can enchant the item with it, but
it would be the cost of basically re-enchanting

1769
02:21:52,097 --> 02:21:53,061
the item.

1770
02:21:53,061 --> 02:21:55,954
ORION: How much would that be?

1771
02:21:55,954 --> 02:22:13,311
MATT: That would cost approximately 25,000 gold
pieces.

1772
02:22:13,311 --> 02:22:14,706
SAM: Oh jeez.

1773
02:22:14,706 --> 02:22:20,737
MATT: And it would take the better part of a year. A
plus-two Ring of Protection is a very powerful

1774
02:22:20,737 --> 02:22:21,647
item.

1775
02:22:21,647 --> 02:22:23,163
SAM: It's worth it. It's a good investment.

1776
02:22:23,163 --> 02:22:26,186
MATT: That you even acquired one earlier was great
luck.

1777
02:22:26,186 --> 02:22:29,496
ORION: How about buffing the ring of source
spelling--

1778
02:22:29,496 --> 02:22:32,558
MATT: The Ring of Spell Storing?

1779
02:22:32,558 --> 02:22:36,163
SAM: The thing that I had that I still want. That
one.

1780
02:22:36,163 --> 02:22:47,314
MATT: The Ring of Spell Storing? That's its
enchantment. There is no more powerful version of

1781
02:22:47,314 --> 02:22:54,046
the Ring of Spell Storing. If you wanted to attempt to
do that yourself on your own time, you could. That

1782
02:22:54,046 --> 02:22:58,291
will cost you upward 60,000 gold pieces and about
a year.

1783
02:22:58,291 --> 02:23:00,149
ORION: No, not right now.

1784
02:23:00,149 --> 02:23:03,295
LAURA: How about we stick to the level we're at?

1785
02:23:03,295 --> 02:23:06,222
ORION: I didn't know all that stuff was going to
be that way. That's why I asked.

1786
02:23:06,222 --> 02:23:08,358
LIAM: How do you learn if you don't ask?

1787
02:23:08,358 --> 02:23:12,284
MATT: It's good to ask these things.

1788
02:23:12,284 --> 02:23:20,886
ORION: (laughs) So okay. While the days are going,
I want to roll for animal handling to teach

1789
02:23:20,886 --> 02:23:24,494
Lockheed stuff, which is every morning, whatever.

1790
02:23:24,494 --> 02:23:30,845
MATT: I'll say throughout the week, 'cause you've
taught Lockheed a lot of things back to back. You

1791
02:23:30,845 --> 02:23:36,712
can't cram everything in there in the three to
four days and like: "You learn everything!"

1792
02:23:36,712 --> 02:23:39,857
Because you've already taught Lockheed one thing
this week. Roll for a second thing you want to

1793
02:23:39,857 --> 02:23:41,219
teach Lockheed.

1794
02:23:41,219 --> 02:23:45,955
ORION: Like, with advantage? I'm just having fun.

1795
02:23:45,955 --> 02:23:48,716
MATT: Sure, I'll give you advantage on that.

1796
02:23:48,716 --> 02:23:52,923
ORION: That's fine, that's fine. I'll take that.
That's 17.

1797
02:23:52,923 --> 02:23:55,068
MATT: Roll advantage. Go for it.

1798
02:23:55,068 --> 02:23:56,913
ORION: 17.

1799
02:23:56,913 --> 02:23:59,921
TRAVIS: For the sake of brevity, can I roll one
beard check?

1800
02:23:59,921 --> 02:24:02,214
MATT: Yeah. You can roll several beard checks.

1801
02:24:02,214 --> 02:24:03,442
TRAVIS: 43.

1802
02:24:03,442 --> 02:24:05,507
MATT: 43. It starts filling in.

1803
02:24:05,507 --> 02:24:06,740
TRAVIS: 81.

1804
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:07,833
MATT: Nope.

1805
02:24:07,833 --> 02:24:09,001
TRAVIS: 86.

1806
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:10,338
LIAM: Aw, come on Grog.

1807
02:24:10,338 --> 02:24:11,627
TRAVS: 16.

1808
02:24:11,627 --> 02:24:12,748
MATT: 16.

1809
02:24:12,748 --> 02:24:19,831
TRAVIS: 68, 19. 58.

1810
02:24:19,831 --> 02:24:24,459
MATT: Okay. So by the time the week comes to an end, the
other side of your beard has finally filled in and

1811
02:24:24,459 --> 02:24:26,379
you are back to a full beard, Grog.

1812
02:24:26,379 --> 02:24:28,295
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

1813
02:24:28,295 --> 02:24:33,395
MATT: So yeah, that succeeds. It takes you a few
days to get it though, but what do you want to

1814
02:24:33,395 --> 02:24:36,772
teach Lockheed?

1815
02:24:36,772 --> 02:24:39,473
ORION: I want to teach him to be quiet.

1816
02:24:39,473 --> 02:24:47,425
MATT: A very important thing to teach a creature.
So Lockheed has learned to be quiet. Good. Anything

1817
02:24:47,425 --> 02:24:48,490
else?

1818
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:58,087
ORION: Yes. I got that, that. Throughout the days,
I'm going to go all the shops and see how many

1819
02:24:58,087 --> 02:25:05,727
glass mirrors-- I'm looking for mirrors, just all
kinds of mirrors, every size.

1820
02:25:05,727 --> 02:25:10,809
MATT: There are plenty of mirrors out there. There
are general stores that sell them all over.

1821
02:25:10,809 --> 02:25:14,123
ORION: I'm looking for five-by-five to ten-by-ten
size mirrors.

1822
02:25:14,123 --> 02:25:15,184
SAM: Feet?!

1823
02:25:15,184 --> 02:25:17,534
ORION: Yeah. No, inches.

1824
02:25:17,534 --> 02:25:26,447
MATT: Okay. I misunderstood. Yeah. You could've
had them custom made if they weren't out there,

1825
02:25:26,447 --> 02:25:29,702
but they have mirrors of that size available.

1826
02:25:29,702 --> 02:25:34,506
ORION: I need about 1,500 of them. Can I get
1,500? How many can I get?

1827
02:25:34,506 --> 02:25:37,975
MATT: There aren't that many mirrors in the city.

1828
02:25:37,975 --> 02:25:40,505
ORION: Okay. All of them.

1829
02:25:40,505 --> 02:25:44,096
SAM: You know, if you hold two next to each other
there looks like there's a million of them.

1830
02:25:44,096 --> 02:25:46,046
ORION: You know what, that's true.

1831
02:25:46,046 --> 02:25:53,105
MATT: They're five gold apiece, and of what is
currently available for purchase, you may be able

1832
02:25:53,105 --> 02:25:58,400
to acquire about 35 mirrors, and you'll clean out
most of the places that will stop selling them to

1833
02:25:58,400 --> 02:25:59,432
you.

1834
02:25:59,432 --> 02:26:02,333
LIAM: That's cutting-edge technology in this day
and age.

1835
02:26:02,333 --> 02:26:08,357
ORION: How many, if I laid them out on a flat
surface, how many-- (laughs) How many feet would

1836
02:26:08,357 --> 02:26:11,616
that cover?

1837
02:26:11,616 --> 02:26:19,602
LIAM: Well, two per foot, Tibs. They're five
inches apiece, right? You can fit two in a foot.

1838
02:26:19,602 --> 02:26:22,111
So you just bought 35, so that's about--

1839
02:26:22,111 --> 02:26:27,427
LAURA: 17 feet! 17 whole feet of mirrors!

1840
02:26:27,427 --> 02:26:32,705
SAM: If you're doing a square, it's three feet by
three feet.

1841
02:26:32,705 --> 02:26:36,494
MATT: Yeah, four by four. So there you go. Four by
four.

1842
02:26:36,494 --> 02:26:39,521
ORION: I'll take all that. How much is that?

1843
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:47,453
MATT: Okay. 35 times five. So we're looking at 175
gold.

1844
02:26:47,453 --> 02:26:59,650
ORION: Done. And then, for timeline stuff, I'm
going to do as much as I can to start enchanting

1845
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:03,431
my bolts, and I'm going to go work with Keyleth on
stuff.

1846
02:27:03,431 --> 02:27:06,415
MATT: Keyleth's been working with Percy this whole
time.

1847
02:27:06,415 --> 02:27:08,136
MARISHA: The whole time?

1848
02:27:08,136 --> 02:27:11,189
MATT: It's taken the entire week for him, you said
you were assisting him.

1849
02:27:11,189 --> 02:27:14,358
MARISHA: No, you said I couldn't assist him. I had
no intelligence to assist him.

1850
02:27:14,358 --> 02:27:19,053
MATT: I thought you said you were still going to
help cheer him on. Okay, then no worries. Then yeah,

1851
02:27:19,122 --> 02:27:20,095
you're available.

1852
02:27:20,095 --> 02:27:27,019
ORION: I'm going to try to make as many sleep
bolts as I can. But the other thing with Keyleth is I

1853
02:27:27,019 --> 02:27:35,969
would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke
screen, but it consists of holy water. So I use a

1854
02:27:35,969 --> 02:27:39,846
pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a
mist instead of a smoke.

1855
02:27:39,846 --> 02:27:45,470
MATT: The enchantment of an arrow to do that is
the use of a Fog spell. There is no way to infuse

1856
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:47,298
a Fog spell with holy water.

1857
02:27:47,298 --> 02:27:50,513
MARISHA: That's what I was saying. I don't know if
you can do holy water. I can do a Fog spell.

1858
02:27:50,513 --> 02:27:52,693
ORION: Can we infuse a Fog spell with a Sleep
spell?

1859
02:27:52,693 --> 02:27:53,857
MATT: No.

1860
02:27:53,857 --> 02:27:55,382
ORION: Can we try super hard?

1861
02:27:55,382 --> 02:27:57,745
MATT: Sure. Make a roll.

1862
02:27:57,745 --> 02:27:59,291
ORION: God damn it. Okay.

1863
02:27:59,291 --> 02:28:01,915
MARISHA: Like, the best I could possibly do is
maybe take one of these holy water things.

1864
02:28:01,915 --> 02:28:03,605
ORION: What am I rolling?

1865
02:28:03,605 --> 02:28:04,718
MATT: Plus arcana.

1866
02:28:04,718 --> 02:28:07,303
TRAVIS: Do you think it matters? No.

1867
02:28:07,303 --> 02:28:08,355
ORION: 24.

1868
02:28:08,355 --> 02:28:14,047
MATT: 24. Okay. After spending approximately 500
gold in materials, the enchantment fails, both

1869
02:28:14,047 --> 02:28:19,819
spells fizzled. You lost 500 gold. But now you
know. Probably can't combine two spells into a

1870
02:28:19,819 --> 02:28:21,150
single enchantment.

1871
02:28:21,150 --> 02:28:23,514
LIAM: And knowing is half the battle.

1872
02:28:23,514 --> 02:28:25,500
ORION: Don't worry, it came out of my pocket.

1873
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:26,927
SAM: I've got fog.

1874
02:28:26,927 --> 02:28:27,782
ORION: Okay.

1875
02:28:27,782 --> 02:28:30,474
TRAVIS: How about you get nothing else, and we
move on?

1876
02:28:30,474 --> 02:28:31,703
ORION: Last thing.

1877
02:28:31,703 --> 02:28:33,910
TRAVIS: No last thing.

1878
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:35,379
ORION: I stop at Allura's.

1879
02:28:35,379 --> 02:28:38,815
MATT: You go towards the Cloudtop District, and
the guards stop you again.

1880
02:28:38,815 --> 02:28:45,106
ORION: I remember that as I walk up, and I go back
to Greyskull Keep.

1881
02:28:45,106 --> 02:28:46,472
MATT: All right.

1882
02:28:46,472 --> 02:28:47,867
MARISHA: Oh wait, I don't do that.

1883
02:28:47,867 --> 02:28:48,915
ORION: Oh wait, I don't do that.

1884
02:28:48,915 --> 02:28:50,362
MARISHA: #OrionAcaba.

1885
02:28:50,362 --> 02:28:53,411
ORION: I realize what I'm doing, and I stop.

1886
02:28:53,411 --> 02:28:59,352
LIAM: Also. This will just take ten seconds, at
some point in the week, when Keyleth is taking a

1887
02:28:59,352 --> 02:29:05,093
walk, I go into her garden, and I clip one flower,
and I take it.

1888
02:29:05,093 --> 02:29:11,150
MATT: How many sleep bolts?

1889
02:29:11,150 --> 02:29:16,330
LIAM: Go sleep in your money.

1890
02:29:16,330 --> 02:29:18,694
ORION: You said I could do that.

1891
02:29:18,694 --> 02:29:21,510
TALIESIN: You're busy this week.

1892
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:26,844
SAM: Can he get back to the keep and we've all
left four days ago?

1893
02:29:26,844 --> 02:29:29,576
(laughter)

1894
02:29:29,576 --> 02:29:35,339
ORION: Carrying groceries in, look, guys: hoagie
stuff!

1895
02:29:35,339 --> 02:29:40,171
SAM: Dear Tiberius. We left.

1896
02:29:40,171 --> 02:29:43,046
LAURA: We got really bored and we left.

1897
02:29:43,046 --> 02:29:52,046
MATT: Okay, I will say for each arrow, it will
cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to

1898
02:29:52,046 --> 02:29:53,527
do, per arrow.

1899
02:29:53,527 --> 02:29:55,014
LAURA: Six days per arrow?

1900
02:29:55,014 --> 02:30:00,734
MATT: Yes. It's one day per 100 gold of an
enchantment. Which is even me making it higher

1901
02:30:00,734 --> 02:30:03,456
than the book says. It should take you four times
that.

1902
02:30:03,456 --> 02:30:06,492
ORION: Cool. Can it cost more if I hire a mage?

1903
02:30:06,492 --> 02:30:09,046
LAURA: (screams)

1904
02:30:09,046 --> 02:30:13,866
MATT: You want to hire a mage?

1905
02:30:13,866 --> 02:30:15,685
MARISHA: I need to do shit, too. I can't be
everyone's bitch.

1906
02:30:15,685 --> 02:30:18,779
MATT: So three and a half days and it cost you
1,200 gold for a single sleep bolt.

1907
02:30:18,779 --> 02:30:21,753
ORION: Sweet. And I do two of those. And I'm
broke.

1908
02:30:21,753 --> 02:30:24,280
LIAM: He's spent people, he's spent.

1909
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:27,330
MATT: Okay, so you've done all of your
shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week

1910
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:30,837
doing those. All right, so there we go. You're
broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person.

1911
02:30:30,837 --> 02:30:32,019
Keyleth.

1912
02:30:32,019 --> 02:30:35,083
MARISHA: I got to Gilmore's and I buy an alchemy
set.

1913
02:30:35,083 --> 02:30:40,012
MATT: Okay. That comes to--

1914
02:30:40,012 --> 02:30:42,124
SAM: 95,000 gold

1915
02:30:42,124 --> 02:30:44,915
ORION: It's going to be a lot more than you think,
apparently.

1916
02:30:44,915 --> 02:30:47,882
MATT: Alchemist supplies? 50 gold.

1917
02:30:47,882 --> 02:30:49,263
ORION: Oh, come on!

1918
02:30:49,263 --> 02:30:53,751
MATT: Not enchanted, yo. "It's magic, give me all
the magic!"

1919
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:56,336
TALIESIN: This is made of things.

1920
02:30:56,336 --> 02:31:02,267
MARISHA: This is made of things. And then I go
home and I make a few Cure Wounds potions. Try it

1921
02:31:02,267 --> 02:31:07,622
out, since I've learned and I've been studying and
I've been doing my research. So maybe a few level

1922
02:31:07,622 --> 02:31:10,154
two, level three Cure Wounds potions?

1923
02:31:10,154 --> 02:31:16,423
MATT: A level two healing potion, a greater
healing potion. The materials involved in creating

1924
02:31:16,423 --> 02:31:23,448
that will come to, I'd say about 400 apiece, and
you'd have time to create two. It's about four

1925
02:31:23,448 --> 02:31:25,225
days per potion.

1926
02:31:25,225 --> 02:31:26,948
SAM: (whispered) How much do they cost?

1927
02:31:26,948 --> 02:31:32,485
MATT: To purchase? They cost about 500 to 600.
She's getting a discount because she's making it

1928
02:31:32,485 --> 02:31:33,685
herself.

1929
02:31:33,685 --> 02:31:37,443
MARISHA: Wait, they cost 500 to 600 and they cost
400 for me to make them?

1930
02:31:37,443 --> 02:31:42,785
MATT: Yes. It's your first time doing it. They'll
probably get cheaper over time as you get better

1931
02:31:42,785 --> 02:31:44,057
at it.

1932
02:31:44,057 --> 02:31:50,301
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Cheaper over time as I get
better at it? That's funsies. Well, let me make--

1933
02:31:50,301 --> 02:31:52,899
What is that? A greater healing potion?

1934
02:31:52,899 --> 02:31:57,207
MATT: It's a greater healing. So for each one you
make, roll a d20 and add five.

1935
02:31:57,207 --> 02:31:59,047
MARISHA: Let me make one for right now.

1936
02:31:59,047 --> 02:32:00,485
MATT: Okay.

1937
02:32:00,485 --> 02:32:03,218
MARISHA: That's an 18. That's pretty good.

1938
02:32:03,218 --> 02:32:05,518
MATT: Then yeah, you successfully create the
potion. No issue.

1939
02:32:05,518 --> 02:32:16,714
MARISHA: Awesome. I had a Percy-roll! And he hates
me for it. How long will it take me to make a

1940
02:32:16,714 --> 02:32:18,182
Daylight scroll?

1941
02:32:18,182 --> 02:32:20,612
MATT: A Daylight scroll? What level spell is
that?

1942
02:32:20,612 --> 02:32:21,874
MARISHA: Third.

1943
02:32:21,874 --> 02:32:30,999
MATT: Third? That'll cost you about, I'd say, 600
gold pieces. It'll take you six days. You don't

1944
02:32:31,032 --> 02:32:34,699
have time. You could pay more to have somebody else
help you make one if you wanted to.

1945
02:32:34,699 --> 02:32:39,692
MARISHA: Then I make two greater healing potions.
Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take

1946
02:32:39,692 --> 02:32:52,054
one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see
if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a

1947
02:32:52,054 --> 02:32:58,895
holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll
go (shatters) with my fog spell.

1948
02:32:58,895 --> 02:33:08,761
MATT: You know that upon throwing the holy water,
it would shatter. It would create a fog, but the

1949
02:33:08,761 --> 02:33:14,490
holy water itself would just affect the creature
you threw it at. You'd be able to blend the two

1950
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:19,237
enchantments; they don't necessarily mix. The fog
itself is not created from the water, it's created

1951
02:33:19,237 --> 02:33:21,579
from the glass that you're enchanting.

1952
02:33:21,579 --> 02:33:25,169
LAURA: Plus, we didn't get any holy water, we only
got holy oil to put on our weapons.

1953
02:33:25,169 --> 02:33:26,993
MATT: You have a couple of flasks of holy water.

1954
02:33:26,993 --> 02:33:35,780
MARISHA: What if I enchant it with Daylight? Oh
wait, it still won't--

1955
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:39,912
MATT: It's a whole different thing. Daylight,
that's more of a scroll thing.

1956
02:33:39,912 --> 02:33:44,216
MARISHA: I'm going to do it, anyway. I'm going to
do the fog thing, because I said it. I'm going to

1957
02:33:44,216 --> 02:33:45,195
commit.

1958
02:33:45,195 --> 02:33:54,222
MATT: Okay. That will cost you-- I'll put it at
500 gold pieces. And that'll take you five days.

1959
02:33:54,222 --> 02:33:56,393
ORION: For a fog scroll?

1960
02:33:56,393 --> 02:34:02,851
MARISHA: No, for the fog holy water thing. It's a
holy smoke grenade.

1961
02:34:02,851 --> 02:34:07,068
LIAM: Someday, we will get out of the character
creation menu, but not this day.

1962
02:34:07,068 --> 02:34:10,697
TALIESIN: I don't like the nose yet. It's too
low.

1963
02:34:10,697 --> 02:34:12,646
MARISHA: Sure. That'll be my two things I do.

1964
02:34:12,646 --> 02:34:15,113
MATT: Okay, roll another d20. Plus five.

1965
02:34:15,113 --> 02:34:17,015
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1966
02:34:17,015 --> 02:34:24,611
MATT: All right. You feel the fog enchantment take
shape in the glass vial. It seems relatively

1967
02:34:24,611 --> 02:34:34,327
unstable. You gather that this glass was not meant
to contain an enchantment from the get-go. You

1968
02:34:34,327 --> 02:34:37,832
somehow manage to make it function, but you have
to be very careful with that vial.

1969
02:34:37,832 --> 02:34:39,415
ORION: Here, put it in here.

1970
02:34:39,415 --> 02:34:42,374
MATT: Who knows what'll happen if it actually is
thrown?

1971
02:34:42,374 --> 02:34:44,157
LAURA: Don't put it in a Bag of Holding.

1972
02:34:44,157 --> 02:34:45,699
LIAM: Give it to Scanlan.

1973
02:34:45,699 --> 02:34:47,905
MARISHA: Who would like a very unstable item?

1974
02:34:47,905 --> 02:34:50,809
LAURA: Percy's used to unstable things.

1975
02:34:50,809 --> 02:34:52,479
MARISHA: I give it to Scanlan.

1976
02:34:52,479 --> 02:34:54,258
TALIESIN: Was that a jab at my-- No, never mind.

1977
02:34:54,258 --> 02:34:57,635
MATT: It's a fog-enchanted vial of holy water. You
can write it down that way if you'd like.

1978
02:34:57,635 --> 02:35:03,922
SAM: I'll just put it on my back. I'll just hang
it.

1979
02:35:03,922 --> 02:35:15,082
MARISHA: Please be careful. Wait, I tell him.
Scanlan, this is very delicate. Please be very

1980
02:35:15,082 --> 02:35:16,220
gentle with this.

1981
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:21,075
SAM: I will put it where I put all gentle things.

1982
02:35:21,075 --> 02:35:24,645
MARISHA: That I trust. I trust that more. Fine.
Good.

1983
02:35:24,645 --> 02:35:28,291
ORION: You do not make the wisest decisions here
your Majesty, I must say.

1984
02:35:28,291 --> 02:35:30,333
MATT: What was once holy--

1985
02:35:30,333 --> 02:35:34,027
(laughter)

1986
02:35:34,027 --> 02:35:35,456
MATT: All right.

1987
02:35:35,456 --> 02:35:36,678
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1988
02:35:36,678 --> 02:35:41,250
SAM: I give everyone the chainmail.

1989
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:43,272
MATT: Okay. You give all the chainmail.

1990
02:35:43,272 --> 02:35:45,286
LAURA: Oh. Look at this, so fancy.

1991
02:35:45,286 --> 02:35:51,106
SAM: I take that fancy box I bought a couple times
ago, and I take the blue crystal that we found in

1992
02:35:51,106 --> 02:35:58,614
our very first adventure and I put it in and I
seal it tight. Shit. I had one more thing I wanted

1993
02:35:58,614 --> 02:36:05,217
to do. Oh yes, I drink my Shit-Scrying Potion,
shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen. And

1994
02:36:05,217 --> 02:36:09,789
tell the help, don't touch it.

1995
02:36:09,789 --> 02:36:15,010
MATT: Okay. (laughs) It takes much convincing, but
nevertheless they acquiesce to your request, being

1996
02:36:15,010 --> 02:36:19,390
the boss. All right. Anything else?

1997
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:24,791
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just going to let the guards know
to watch our guest while we're away. Keep him

1998
02:36:24,791 --> 02:36:26,568
under protection.

1999
02:36:26,568 --> 02:36:28,463
TRAVIS: Are we leaving him here?

2000
02:36:28,463 --> 02:36:29,766
TALIESIN: I think so.

2001
02:36:29,766 --> 02:36:31,119
LAURA: Oh god.

2002
02:36:31,119 --> 02:36:32,237
MATT: The what?

2003
02:36:32,237 --> 02:36:36,281
ORION: The guy who built stuff, regardless, did I
do that or is that just in my head?

2004
02:36:36,281 --> 02:36:38,643
MATT: Lord Daxio, you mean? What about him?

2005
02:36:38,643 --> 02:36:41,635
ORION: So I didn't do that yet.

2006
02:36:41,635 --> 02:36:44,133
TRAVIS: Yeah, you going to do something on his
room, Keyleth?

2007
02:36:44,133 --> 02:37:00,869
LAURA: I go find Jarett, and I give him 200 gold.
And I say, do not let-- Desmond? Leave your side.

2008
02:37:00,869 --> 02:37:07,579
Watch him, watch for invisible anything. Protect
him with everything you can.

2009
02:37:07,579 --> 02:37:09,925
MATT: "I will do this with my life. Do not
worry."

2010
02:37:09,925 --> 02:37:11,678
SAM: Have we given them a raise?

2011
02:37:11,678 --> 02:37:13,383
LAURA: I just gave him 200 fucking gold.

2012
02:37:13,383 --> 02:37:15,008
TRAVIS: Double the guard on him.

2013
02:37:15,008 --> 02:37:22,587
LAURA: And yeah, everybody-- fuck. I give a
hundred--

2014
02:37:22,587 --> 02:37:25,803
SAM: Five of them make 100 a month, two of them
make 50 a month.

2015
02:37:25,803 --> 02:37:34,962
LAURA: I give another 200 to him and tell him to
pass it out to the rest of the guard. We'll be

2016
02:37:34,962 --> 02:37:36,247
back soon!

2017
02:37:36,247 --> 02:37:40,319
MATT: "Very generous, and I think they'll be very
happy to find this. Thank you very much."

2018
02:37:40,319 --> 02:37:43,643
LAURA: And add another guard to the watch.

2019
02:37:43,643 --> 02:37:47,426
TRAVIS: Two to Desmond. At all times.

2020
02:37:47,426 --> 02:37:51,051
MATT: "Very well. I will do this. Thank you."

2021
02:37:51,051 --> 02:37:52,384
LAURA: Thank you.

2022
02:37:52,384 --> 02:37:59,138
ORION: I going to tell Erwen to go and ask for
court for the lord that can construct and tell him

2023
02:37:59,138 --> 02:38:05,062
that we would like to make some changes and have
the cells converted into barracks for our

2024
02:38:05,062 --> 02:38:06,064
soldiers.

2025
02:38:06,064 --> 02:38:07,727
SAM: That won't do anything.

2026
02:38:07,727 --> 02:38:10,002
ORION: That's what I do. That's what Tiberius
does.

2027
02:38:10,002 --> 02:38:13,930
MATT: Okay. Erwen goes, "All right, sir." And he
wanders off.

2028
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:18,112
ORION: Getting a good reputation does not mean
holding prison cells.

2029
02:38:18,145 --> 02:38:22,488
MATT: About an hour later Erwen returns and says, "I'm
sorry. They would not allow me into the central

2030
02:38:22,488 --> 02:38:29,986
"district. I do not have the proper papers to pass
within. I mentioned that I worked for you, and

2031
02:38:29,986 --> 02:38:33,087
"they told me I was not to enter."

2032
02:38:33,087 --> 02:38:35,493
ORION: Oh, maybe you should have said a different
name.

2033
02:38:35,493 --> 02:38:38,220
SAM: They would have known when they got to our
keep.

2034
02:38:38,220 --> 02:38:39,862
ORION: That's true. (laughs)

2035
02:38:39,862 --> 02:38:41,233
LAURA: Shall we head out?

2036
02:38:41,233 --> 02:38:42,366
TALIESIN: Yes.

2037
02:38:42,366 --> 02:38:44,617
LAURA: Did I learn anything from Seeker Asum?

2038
02:38:44,752 --> 02:38:47,915
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, adding your wisdom
modifier.

2039
02:38:47,915 --> 02:38:49,537
LAURA: Ah jeez, really?

2040
02:38:49,537 --> 02:38:51,208
LIAM: Come on, Laura.

2041
02:38:51,208 --> 02:38:52,738
LAURA: What if I roll like shit?

2042
02:38:52,738 --> 02:38:57,892
LIAM: Then it'll be hilarious. Roll that die. Come
on. Roll high and it will be amazing.

2043
02:38:57,892 --> 02:39:00,889
MATT: Make it with advantage, because Asum is a
very good teacher.

2044
02:39:00,889 --> 02:39:02,503
LAURA: He is. He's so good.

2045
02:39:02,503 --> 02:39:03,830
SAM: He's awesome.

2046
02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:05,850
LAURA: (fake crying) No, that was terrible.

2047
02:39:05,850 --> 02:39:07,345
MARISHA: Advantage!

2048
02:39:07,345 --> 02:39:10,197
LIAM: You are playing DND right now! All right.

2049
02:39:10,197 --> 02:39:15,024
LAURA: Plus my wisdom. 17.

2050
02:39:15,024 --> 02:39:17,603
MATT: 17, okay.

2051
02:39:17,603 --> 02:39:19,521
LIAM: Is she an emperor now?

2052
02:39:19,521 --> 02:39:27,666
MATT: (laughs) Is that how this works? All right,
so talking with Asum. He works with you for a bit

2053
02:39:27,666 --> 02:39:31,786
and teaches you the ranger ability Skirmisher's
Stealth.

2054
02:39:31,786 --> 02:39:34,157
SAM: Skirmisher's Stealth?

2055
02:39:34,157 --> 02:39:46,329
MATT: So if you start one of your turns hidden
from a creature, you can then, as a bonus action

2056
02:39:46,329 --> 02:39:50,520
at the end of your turn, make another stealth
check to remain hidden from them. You essentially

2057
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:53,990
can dive between areas and still be hidden.

2058
02:39:53,990 --> 02:39:55,637
LAURA: While I'm attacking?

2059
02:39:55,637 --> 02:39:57,493
LIAM: That's all ranger stuff?

2060
02:39:57,493 --> 02:39:58,806
LAURA: Cool.

2061
02:39:58,806 --> 02:40:02,527
LIAM and SAM: (air horn noises)

2062
02:40:02,527 --> 02:40:06,822
MATT: So yeah. We'll go over the details of it
after the game. Essentially, you learn a new

2063
02:40:06,822 --> 02:40:08,950
ranger ability from Seeker Asum.

2064
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:09,989
MARISHA: Dope.

2065
02:40:09,989 --> 02:40:11,635
LIAM: Wow. I bought some sticks.

2066
02:40:11,635 --> 02:40:13,222
MATT: All right.

2067
02:40:13,222 --> 02:40:18,358
ORION: At the end of the first day, before all of
that stuff happens. Sorry, guys, this is

2068
02:40:18,358 --> 02:40:19,357
necessary.

2069
02:40:19,357 --> 02:40:20,942
TRAVIS: Is it?

2070
02:40:20,942 --> 02:40:28,150
LIAM: Everybody shut up and let Grog go on a one
man, solo kill spree.

2071
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:31,153
TRAVIS: It's bound to happen. He's going to
secede.

2072
02:40:31,153 --> 02:40:35,436
MATT: Tiberius, what do you want to do?

2073
02:40:35,436 --> 02:40:40,789
ORION: I'm in my lab the first night and I write a
Scroll of Telescription to my father. And I go,

2074
02:40:40,789 --> 02:40:45,163
dear father, and I tell him about the circumstances 
with the vampires.

2075
02:40:45,163 --> 02:40:47,961
LAURA: Dear diary. Sorry.

2076
02:40:47,961 --> 02:40:55,569
ORION: At the end of it I go: I invoke the
ambassador's right of war time as of now, and

2077
02:40:55,569 --> 02:41:02,143
moreover as your son when I provide concrete
evidence, you will know. But in the meantime, I

2078
02:41:02,143 --> 02:41:07,164
would have you gather 50 ground troops of the
Draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the

2079
02:41:07,164 --> 02:41:11,629
wyvern fleet. Have them at the ready for my
signal. I know it will take you a few days of

2080
02:41:11,629 --> 02:41:17,788
travel to get here, but this is a town of vampires
and possibly liches, which you know need to be

2081
02:41:17,788 --> 02:41:22,138
destroyed no matter what. Your son, with love,
Tiberius.

2082
02:41:22,138 --> 02:41:23,470
MATT: All right.

2083
02:41:23,470 --> 02:41:29,472
LAURA: Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the
giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can

2084
02:41:29,472 --> 02:41:34,932
invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever
he wants.

2085
02:41:34,932 --> 02:41:36,942
ORION: I don't know what's going on over there.

2086
02:41:36,942 --> 02:41:41,721
MATT: All right. As the week comes to a close,
eventually a note appears before you, Tiberius,

2087
02:41:41,721 --> 02:41:52,180
within your magical room. (fluttering) It reads:
"Tiberius, child. I understand your request.

2088
02:41:52,180 --> 02:42:01,616
"However, you are fresh to these political matters
and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of

2089
02:42:01,616 --> 02:42:08,769
"a shadow, I would need some very heavy proof to
invoke wartime. Which, if I might add, is not your

2090
02:42:08,769 --> 02:42:15,293
"jurisdiction, but my own. Should you wish to bring
this to my attention, you are welcome to, but you

2091
02:42:15,293 --> 02:42:24,333
"have but one chance before I set aside this
intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock."

2092
02:42:24,333 --> 02:42:29,773
(laughter)

2093
02:42:29,773 --> 02:42:40,605
MATT: "Tiberius, I trust that in time you will
prove yourself to this family and to this country,

2094
02:42:40,605 --> 02:42:46,005
"but for the time being, business matters of this
larger scale are best left to those with

2095
02:42:46,005 --> 02:42:50,038
"experience. With love, Kruvanis Stormwind."

2096
02:42:50,038 --> 02:42:52,446
LIAM: (whispers) Send him three more letters.

2097
02:42:52,446 --> 02:43:03,192
ORION: Damn it. Have to provide proof to my
fucking father. Fine. He didn't say no, which is

2098
02:43:03,192 --> 02:43:07,152
what he always says. Which is a lot better than
what he always says.

2099
02:43:07,152 --> 02:43:12,781
SAM: I walk into Tiberius' room while he's having
this conversation with himself. And I say, what

2100
02:43:12,781 --> 02:43:14,261
are you doing in here?

2101
02:43:14,261 --> 02:43:15,727
ORION: I'm talking to myself, Scanlan.

2102
02:43:15,727 --> 02:43:19,684
SAM: Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to go get some
garlic from the kitchen, and then let's go!

2103
02:43:19,684 --> 02:43:30,551
LAURA: I write a note. Address it to Uriel, hand
it to our main butler. Who I know his name.

2104
02:43:30,551 --> 02:43:31,710
MATT: Erwen.

2105
02:43:31,710 --> 02:43:42,799
LAURA: Erwen. It basically says: Uriel, FYI, we
didn't totally flee. We's looking for evidence.

2106
02:43:42,859 --> 02:43:48,485
No, we didn't flee. We'll be back, how about that?
We'll be back.

2107
02:43:48,485 --> 02:43:50,456
MATT: All right. The note is left with Erwen.

2108
02:43:50,456 --> 02:43:55,020
LAURA: And I tell him, only give this to anybody
if they come looking for us and they're angry.

2109
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:58,807
MATT: "Yes, of course. Of course."

2110
02:43:58,807 --> 02:44:09,164
MARISHA: Grog? Do you think I should do the whole
elemental guardian thing?

2111
02:44:09,164 --> 02:44:10,694
TRAVIS: Why not?

2112
02:44:10,694 --> 02:44:12,017
MARISHA: All right.

2113
02:44:12,017 --> 02:44:13,434
ORION: How are you doing, Grog?

2114
02:44:13,434 --> 02:44:14,721
TRAVIS: I'm fucking bored.

2115
02:44:14,721 --> 02:44:17,793
(laughter)

2116
02:44:17,793 --> 02:44:21,890
TRAVIS: I've been sitting here for 30 fucking
minutes. I'm bored! Cast an elemental and make it

2117
02:44:21,890 --> 02:44:24,479
smash everything around the keep.

2118
02:44:24,479 --> 02:44:33,490
MARISHA: Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it.
Water elemental seems appropriate based on our

2119
02:44:33,490 --> 02:44:43,410
knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar
Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech,

2120
02:44:43,410 --> 02:44:45,045
which I can do.

2121
02:44:45,045 --> 02:44:48,887
TALIESIN: And you say? (gargles water during
Marisha's speech)

2122
02:44:48,887 --> 02:45:01,385
MARISHA: And I say, look, we're going to be gone
for 30 days. We have a visitor here. Make sure

2123
02:45:01,385 --> 02:45:06,478
nothing or no one brings him any harm.

2124
02:45:06,478 --> 02:45:09,350
(laughter)

2125
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:12,050
MATT: I don't have a drink.

2126
02:45:12,050 --> 02:45:14,318
ORION: That make you thirsty?

2127
02:45:14,318 --> 02:45:19,303
TALIESIN: You know, you can speak English, you
don't have to--

2128
02:45:19,303 --> 02:45:25,627
MATT: Yeah. The elemental gives you an acknowledgment
and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent

2129
02:45:25,627 --> 02:45:28,581
of, for my time here, I serve.

2130
02:45:28,581 --> 02:45:30,480
MARISHA: Wait, what? I'm sorry.

2131
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:33,614
MATT: "For my time here, I serve" is essentially
the essence of what you get from him

2132
02:45:33,614 --> 02:45:34,837
MARISHA: For my time here, I serve?

2133
02:45:34,837 --> 02:45:37,154
MATT: For my time here, I serve. All right.

2134
02:45:37,154 --> 02:45:38,206
SAM: Onward.

2135
02:45:38,206 --> 02:45:40,249
LIAM: I love doing this show.

2136
02:45:40,249 --> 02:45:42,489
(laughter)

2137
02:45:42,489 --> 02:45:46,479
SAM: Do we know where we're going?

2138
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:48,851
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know where we're going.

2139
02:45:48,851 --> 02:45:53,629
LIAM: Percival de Rolo knows where we're going to
go.

2140
02:45:53,629 --> 02:45:55,273
TALIESIN: We head to Turst Fields.

2141
02:45:55,273 --> 02:46:00,137
MARISHA: Are we riding there by horseback? Is that
what we're doing?

2142
02:46:00,137 --> 02:46:05,218
SAM: Do we know where we're going?

2143
02:46:05,218 --> 02:46:10,158
MATT: Well, Percy said the Turst Fields. The Turst
Fields you do know. Some of you may have passed by

2144
02:46:10,158 --> 02:46:15,268
them. They are to the east, northeast area of
Westruun, on the eastern side of the continent.

2145
02:46:15,268 --> 02:46:21,352
It's about four and a half days' travel horseback.

2146
02:46:21,352 --> 02:46:23,783
TRAVIS: What if we purchased a carriage?

2147
02:46:23,783 --> 02:46:28,659
ORION: What if we went on airship instead? We have
one at our disposal, do we not?

2148
02:46:28,659 --> 02:46:32,050
MARISHA: Well, we had one at our disposal when we
were friends of the city.

2149
02:46:32,050 --> 02:46:34,666
LAURA: I think it's in the Cloudtop District,
actually.

2150
02:46:34,666 --> 02:46:41,267
LIAM: I think we need to go on the down-low.

2151
02:46:41,267 --> 02:46:44,294
MARISHA: Yeah, let's not tell anybody that we're
leaving.

2152
02:46:44,294 --> 02:46:48,893
SAM: Carriage. Let's go. How much do they cost?

2153
02:46:48,893 --> 02:46:52,905
MARISHA: Do we need a carriage? We have a stable
full of horses.

2154
02:46:52,905 --> 02:46:55,560
LIAM: Rein it in. We're going to fight vampires.

2155
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:01,529
MATT: You have four horses, and you technically
have the teleportation sigil for Westruun.

2156
02:47:01,529 --> 02:47:02,917
LAURA: Oh yeah!

2157
02:47:02,917 --> 02:47:04,888
ORION: Is Briarwood keep over there?

2158
02:47:04,888 --> 02:47:07,681
MATT: Westruun's most of the way across the
continent. It's about a day's ride out from

2159
02:47:07,681 --> 02:47:08,729
Westruun.

2160
02:47:08,729 --> 02:47:10,047
MARISHA: So that would shave time?

2161
02:47:10,047 --> 02:47:11,687
MATT: It would shave about three days off your
journey.

2162
02:47:11,687 --> 02:47:13,601
LIAM: Matt, I'm pretty sure it's "si-google."

2163
02:47:13,601 --> 02:47:19,497
TALIESIN: Turst Fields is just northeast of
Westruun.

2164
02:47:19,497 --> 02:47:21,055
LAURA: Let's do it!

2165
02:47:21,055 --> 02:47:23,189
LIAM: What's in those fields?

2166
02:47:23,189 --> 02:47:29,484
MATT: The Turst Fields are a farming community
that takes care of a lot of the eastern side.

2167
02:47:29,484 --> 02:47:34,796
They're not really an extension of Westruun, but
it's one of the closest cities. And they do a lot

2168
02:47:34,796 --> 02:47:37,927
of food trade up into Whitestone, or did
previously.

2169
02:47:37,927 --> 02:47:40,116
TALIESIN: It's where we would make our camp.

2170
02:47:40,116 --> 02:47:45,493
MARISHA: Let's head there and make camp. And maybe
talk about a plan.

2171
02:47:45,493 --> 02:47:54,135
LIAM: Yes. I think, Percival, you're leading the
way. Use my sister as an advisor, but you're

2172
02:47:54,135 --> 02:47:55,957
leading the way right now.

2173
02:47:55,957 --> 02:48:02,724
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw out a crude map while
we make our way so I can let you all know where

2174
02:48:02,724 --> 02:48:03,824
we're going.

2175
02:48:03,824 --> 02:48:06,381
ORION: Well, then join me in my laboratory,
everyone.

2176
02:48:06,381 --> 02:48:08,909
SAM: All right, yes. We go to Tiberius's
laboratory.

2177
02:48:08,909 --> 02:48:13,285
MATT: Okay. Tiberius, you go ahead and cast
Teleportation Circle.

2178
02:48:13,285 --> 02:48:18,927
ORION: Not yet. I go, hey, look at the laboratory,
guys. What do you think? Scanlan, it looks like

2179
02:48:18,927 --> 02:48:20,262
you're impressed.

2180
02:48:20,262 --> 02:48:22,213
SAM: (dryly) Oh, I'm very impressed.

2181
02:48:22,213 --> 02:48:23,893
MATT: Now you cast Circle of Teleportation.

2182
02:48:23,893 --> 02:48:27,233
ORION: I use my sigil there. I got it set up
there.

2183
02:48:27,233 --> 02:48:33,342
MATT: Yep, and the circle appears. You guys rush
through it. You do not have your horses with you

2184
02:48:33,342 --> 02:48:36,903
because they would not be able to travel through
the teleportation circle with you. However, you

2185
02:48:36,903 --> 02:48:44,447
could probably procure some while you're in
Westruun. In doing that, you guys, for the case of

2186
02:48:44,447 --> 02:48:47,534
brevity on this-- we've been missing that for a
lot of this session.

2187
02:48:47,534 --> 02:48:49,189
LIAM: Let's do this in real time.

2188
02:48:49,189 --> 02:48:58,132
MATT: We'll say the total gold to purchase horses
for the whole party--

2189
02:48:58,132 --> 02:49:01,711
LAURA: After I haggled. Because let's be honest, I
would've.

2190
02:49:01,711 --> 02:49:03,792
MATT: You would've. Go ahead and make a persuasion
roll.

2191
02:49:03,792 --> 02:49:05,219
TRAVIS: You would've.

2192
02:49:05,219 --> 02:49:07,343
ORION: Even in real time.

2193
02:49:07,343 --> 02:49:08,460
MARISHA: Do it.

2194
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:12,389
LAURA: 21.

2195
02:49:12,389 --> 02:49:22,553
MATT: 21? Okay, yeah, would put you at about,
we'll say because you are renowned in this area

2196
02:49:22,553 --> 02:49:27,807
and you've helped Westruun. Helped them during the
Winter's Crest Festival the year before, using

2197
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:33,042
that discount. You manage to procure everyone's
horses, including your warhorse, for 210 gold,

2198
02:49:33,042 --> 02:49:35,722
which is a pretty decent discount.

2199
02:49:35,722 --> 02:49:41,031
LAURA: Yes it is. All right.

2200
02:49:41,031 --> 02:49:42,869
TALIESIN: Can I share my map?

2201
02:49:42,869 --> 02:49:44,383
MATT: You can, yeah.

2202
02:49:44,383 --> 02:49:46,751
LAURA: (gasps) You made a map?

2203
02:49:46,751 --> 02:49:48,785
SAM: You drew that just now?

2204
02:49:48,785 --> 02:49:52,989
TALIESIN: You know I've forged all of our
documents? You are aware of that, right? Any time

2205
02:49:52,989 --> 02:49:54,570
we've needed papers.

2206
02:49:54,570 --> 02:49:58,571
LAURA: Wait, where is Westruun? Oh, there's
Westruun, that's where we are right now. So we

2207
02:49:58,571 --> 02:50:05,559
have to go-- I just spit on your map, Percy. Up
through the woods, into the mountains. Whitestone

2208
02:50:05,559 --> 02:50:06,887
is mountains.

2209
02:50:06,887 --> 02:50:08,127
LIAM: You can handle that.

2210
02:50:08,127 --> 02:50:09,729
LAURA: Yeah, I can handle both.

2211
02:50:09,729 --> 02:50:12,532
TRAVIS: We're here, and we've got to go here.

2212
02:50:12,532 --> 02:50:14,057
LAURA: Right.

2213
02:50:14,057 --> 02:50:15,719
SAM: Let's set out.

2214
02:50:15,719 --> 02:50:24,218
MATT: You have two paths. You have the path into
the center of the Parchwood Woods that leads up

2215
02:50:24,218 --> 02:50:30,094
into the valley of the Alabaster Sierras that
surround it. That is the direct route to

2216
02:50:30,094 --> 02:50:36,322
Whitestone that leads through the main pathway.
The forest to the front of the city. There's also

2217
02:50:36,322 --> 02:50:40,818
the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround
that peninsula that extends into the northern part

2218
02:50:40,818 --> 02:50:48,358
of the continent. They are very tall, fjord-like,
craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along

2219
02:50:48,358 --> 02:50:53,892
the edge. They're a little more treacherous, but a
little more out of the way; a backdoor route. So

2220
02:50:53,892 --> 02:50:55,664
you guys choose which route you want to take.

2221
02:50:55,664 --> 02:50:57,341
TALIESIN: I would prefer not the direct route.

2222
02:50:57,341 --> 02:50:59,207
ORION: Always go in the backdoor.

2223
02:50:59,207 --> 02:51:02,689
TALIESIN: Can you say that anything that is not
laced with sexual innuendo?

2224
02:51:02,689 --> 02:51:14,824
LAURA: Mountain ranges are part of my favored
terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling

2225
02:51:14,824 --> 02:51:15,847
through.

2226
02:51:15,847 --> 02:51:19,252
TALIESIN: I would prefer taking that direction. I
don't want to head straight towards them.

2227
02:51:19,252 --> 02:51:22,718
LAURA: There probably will be mountain giants,
though, remember, that throw boulders and they

2228
02:51:22,718 --> 02:51:24,018
will be terrible.

2229
02:51:24,018 --> 02:51:27,960
TALIESIN: The Parchwood Forests are dangerous as
they are. There's really no safe way.

2230
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:29,732
SAM: I trust Percy; whatever you say.

2231
02:51:29,732 --> 02:51:34,601
MATT: Percy, you are aware that here have been
problems in the past with various mountain-faring

2232
02:51:34,601 --> 02:51:38,688
giants that lived north of Whitestone that
occasionally would wander too far south. They

2233
02:51:38,688 --> 02:51:43,198
mostly kept to themselves, but occasionally they
had some crossover, there were some scuffles here

2234
02:51:43,198 --> 02:51:48,538
and there. So you guys are deciding to take the
Alabaster Sierras?

2235
02:51:48,538 --> 02:51:51,155
LAURA: Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on
everyone.

2236
02:51:51,155 --> 02:51:57,071
MATT: You guys head out from Westruun; it takes
about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the

2237
02:51:57,071 --> 02:52:04,725
Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You
ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say

2238
02:52:04,725 --> 02:52:09,543
that they haven't had much trade or communication
with Whitestone like they used to. They do still

2239
02:52:09,543 --> 02:52:14,484
provide crops and such, but they don't allow
anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at

2240
02:52:14,484 --> 02:52:21,712
the boundary created by the forest. Still pay
gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario,

2241
02:52:21,712 --> 02:52:25,765
but very few folks there seem to question it.
Business as usual is still left within Turst

2242
02:52:25,765 --> 02:52:27,134
Fields.

2243
02:52:27,134 --> 02:52:35,083
Make your way northward to the bottom of the
Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the

2244
02:52:35,083 --> 02:52:40,808
outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice
that the mountains are extremely high in altitude.

2245
02:52:40,808 --> 02:52:45,958
There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree
angle as you continue upward further and further

2246
02:52:45,958 --> 02:52:54,193
and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff
is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down

2247
02:52:54,193 --> 02:53:00,697
into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths
worn up here; it has been used as travel before.

2248
02:53:00,697 --> 02:53:08,044
Although you're uncertain as to how recently it
may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind

2249
02:53:08,044 --> 02:53:12,006
picks up and you have to steel yourself, push
yourself against the side. The path, thankfully,

2250
02:53:12,006 --> 02:53:16,794
is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's
not too much where you're being forced against the

2251
02:53:16,794 --> 02:53:20,411
edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of
the circumstance.

2252
02:53:20,411 --> 02:53:29,865
You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a
day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon.

2253
02:53:29,865 --> 02:53:39,855
Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a
few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of

2254
02:53:39,855 --> 02:53:44,654
stone that jut out from the side. You can see
small nests or bushes that have taken root on

2255
02:53:44,654 --> 02:53:52,755
those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain
range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual

2256
02:53:52,755 --> 02:54:00,636
rock that forms this entire region is almost a
glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that

2257
02:54:00,636 --> 02:54:05,839
are almost translucent, there are parts that are
very milky white. Number one, you can now

2258
02:54:05,839 --> 02:54:12,054
understand as to partially why the area is called
Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard

2259
02:54:12,054 --> 02:54:16,361
mention from Percy in the past of the large
quarries here that mine the stone for various uses

2260
02:54:16,361 --> 02:54:21,035
and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's
where a large portion of the town was built around

2261
02:54:21,035 --> 02:54:23,957
that trade at the beginning of its construction.

2262
02:54:23,957 --> 02:54:31,038
Eventually, you come to a point where there is a
falloff on the path, where the erosion or some

2263
02:54:31,038 --> 02:54:38,328
sort of large impact of the side caused the path
to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth

2264
02:54:38,328 --> 02:54:44,383
fall down the side. There is no way across other
than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that

2265
02:54:44,383 --> 02:54:51,197
goes across about a hundred feet. You see it
rocking (creaking) with the wind.

2266
02:54:51,197 --> 02:54:56,829
TRAVIS: I don't think this looks very stable.

2267
02:54:56,829 --> 02:55:02,724
LAURA: Man, you know what I would give for a
flying fucking carpet right now?

2268
02:55:02,724 --> 02:55:05,595
SAM: So the bridge is out?

2269
02:55:05,595 --> 02:55:10,930
MATT: No, the bridge can be crossed. It looks a
little rickety. It's not terrible or frightening,

2270
02:55:10,930 --> 02:55:14,869
but it's been there for a while, and you can tell
from the color of the rope--

2271
02:55:14,869 --> 02:55:16,943
SAM: How far is it across?

2272
02:55:16,943 --> 02:55:18,413
MATT: A hundred feet.

2273
02:55:18,413 --> 02:55:20,221
ORION: Should I go first, everyone?

2274
02:55:20,221 --> 02:55:24,297
TALIESIN: I want to inspect it from an engineering
perspective, if that's possible.

2275
02:55:24,297 --> 02:55:28,504
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

2276
02:55:28,504 --> 02:55:29,874
TALIESIN: Ten.

2277
02:55:29,874 --> 02:55:36,111
MATT: Okay. Looking at it, I mean, the anchors are
pretty solid in the stonework. There's no

2278
02:55:36,111 --> 02:55:41,017
looseness to their element. The rope itself is
taut and seems to have serviced long enough. There

2279
02:55:41,017 --> 02:55:44,848
are no signs of extreme wear other than just time
and weather.

2280
02:55:44,848 --> 02:55:46,854
LIAM: I'm going to walk forward.

2281
02:55:46,854 --> 02:55:50,419
LAURA: I'm going to tie the fucking rope around
your waist before you do that.

2282
02:55:50,419 --> 02:55:52,389
TALIESIN: That's quite a good idea!

2283
02:55:52,389 --> 02:55:59,777
LIAM: Sarenrae, jeepers. I'm going to use
perception, I'm going to look at it before going

2284
02:55:59,777 --> 02:56:04,840
out. That is a 23.

2285
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:07,537
MATT: All right. Are you taking your horse with
you?

2286
02:56:07,537 --> 02:56:15,141
LIAM: I leave my horse with my sister. I'm on
foot; I'm on all fours, really. Spidering out.

2287
02:56:15,141 --> 02:56:21,567
MATT: Making your way across, you get halfway across the
bridge. There's a creaking sound and slight

2288
02:56:21,567 --> 02:56:25,486
movement as the wind picks up at times and you
(creaking).

2289
02:56:25,486 --> 02:56:33,384
LIAM: So I'm lasting. What would I make, is it an
insight check to decide if I thought Grog could

2290
02:56:33,384 --> 02:56:35,533
make it across this thing?

2291
02:56:35,533 --> 02:56:42,045
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Roll and add
your intelligence modifier.

2292
02:56:42,045 --> 02:56:43,516
TALIESIN: It's a ten.

2293
02:56:43,516 --> 02:56:45,841
LIAM: Take that zero off it, and you've got it.

2294
02:56:45,841 --> 02:56:51,222
MATT: Best you can tell, Grog looks like a big
guy.

2295
02:56:51,222 --> 02:56:57,632
LIAM: This is fun. You swing back and forth. Grog,
I think you might like this!

2296
02:56:57,632 --> 02:57:00,983
MARISHA: How far across is the bridge? A hundred
feet?

2297
02:57:00,983 --> 02:57:05,076
TALIESIN: Once you're across, let's secure the
rope that's attached to you, and we'll make

2298
02:57:05,076 --> 02:57:07,748
ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto.

2299
02:57:07,748 --> 02:57:08,919
LAURA: I like it.

2300
02:57:08,919 --> 02:57:12,660
LIAM: All right, he sounds like a Debbie Downer,
Grog, but I'll go across, and you can follow.

2301
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:15,734
MATT: Okay, you make the rest of your way across.
No issue. The rope bridge carries your weight all

2302
02:57:15,734 --> 02:57:17,028
the way.

2303
02:57:17,028 --> 02:57:20,283
LAURA: Tie a rope. I tie the other side.

2304
02:57:20,283 --> 02:57:22,724
LIAM: Is there anything on the other side I could
tie it to?

2305
02:57:22,724 --> 02:57:30,757
MATT: There's a couple of small cliffside trees
that grow off in strange twisting bonsai tree-like

2306
02:57:30,757 --> 02:57:32,594
branches that stick off. They're pretty sturdy.

2307
02:57:32,594 --> 02:57:34,185
LIAM: I use a sailor knot.

2308
02:57:34,185 --> 02:57:40,350
LAURA: I use a special ranger knot that's really
extra strong.

2309
02:57:40,350 --> 02:57:42,921
MATT: Secret ranger knot. Well played.

2310
02:57:42,921 --> 02:57:45,756
(laughter)

2311
02:57:45,756 --> 02:57:47,670
MATT: Who's up next?

2312
02:57:47,670 --> 02:57:49,798
LIAM: I double-knot mine.

2313
02:57:49,798 --> 02:57:51,412
SAM: We've got to get the horses across.

2314
02:57:51,412 --> 02:57:52,719
TRAVIS: No, they ain't coming.

2315
02:57:52,719 --> 02:57:55,557
SAM: They're not coming? Oh. Well, I just
Dimension Door across, then.

2316
02:57:55,557 --> 02:58:00,650
LIAM: Jeepers! Will you warn a half-elf when
you're going to do that?

2317
02:58:00,650 --> 02:58:07,892
MATT: Spooks you for a second. You hold on
and you make your way across. You guys

2318
02:58:07,892 --> 02:58:10,621
are now on the other side. You're holding onto
everyone's horses left behind.

2319
02:58:10,668 --> 02:58:11,948
LAURA: Trinket.

2320
02:58:11,948 --> 02:58:15,926
TRAVIS: I tie up all the horses to a very large
tree.

2321
02:58:15,926 --> 02:58:17,953
MARISHA: Are we going by foot now?

2322
02:58:17,953 --> 02:58:29,643
LAURA: Looks like it. Tiberius, are you still on
our side? Are you with me, still? Will you cast

2323
02:58:29,643 --> 02:58:32,155
Fly on Trinket? I love you.

2324
02:58:32,155 --> 02:58:37,635
ORION: Sure. To make it across?

2325
02:58:37,635 --> 02:58:42,254
LAURA: I can climb on him and you cast Fly and you
only have to use one little spell.

2326
02:58:42,254 --> 02:58:47,004
ORION: If I cast it on him, I would probably jump on
myself, because I'm a little bit heavier than you

2327
02:58:47,004 --> 02:58:48,392
are, darling.

2328
02:58:48,392 --> 02:58:49,442
LAURA: Then do it!

2329
02:58:49,442 --> 02:58:50,963
LIAM: She's haggling you right now.

2330
02:58:50,963 --> 02:58:52,618
ORION: You can have him afterwards.

2331
02:58:52,618 --> 02:58:56,091
LAURA: Yeah, you can go, and I'll just use the
little rope.

2332
02:58:56,091 --> 02:58:59,511
ORION: Fine. Proceed.

2333
02:58:59,511 --> 02:59:01,428
MATT: You cast Fly on Trinket--

2334
02:59:01,428 --> 02:59:05,055
ORION: No, I don't. I don't do shit yet. I wait
for you guys to get across, so if something

2335
02:59:05,055 --> 02:59:06,984
happens, then I can cast it.

2336
02:59:06,984 --> 02:59:08,752
LAURA: Okay, just protect him.

2337
02:59:08,752 --> 02:59:10,653
MATT: So you get on Trinket's back?

2338
02:59:10,653 --> 02:59:12,510
LAURA: No, he hasn't cast it on him yet.

2339
02:59:12,510 --> 02:59:15,096
MATT: So who's going across now?

2340
02:59:15,096 --> 02:59:16,146
LAURA: I am!

2341
02:59:16,146 --> 02:59:22,380
MATT: Okay, you make it across. No problem. You're
light enough and able to guide the movement of the

2342
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,281
bridge.

2343
02:59:23,281 --> 02:59:25,675
LAURA: Good thing I only had one frittata the
other day!

2344
02:59:25,675 --> 02:59:31,069
MARISHA: Here's my question. What looks shaky, the
connection of the bridge or the actual, physical

2345
02:59:31,069 --> 02:59:32,639
condition of the bridge itself?

2346
02:59:32,639 --> 02:59:35,959
MATT: The physical condition of the bridge. There
is no actual visible point that is--

2347
02:59:35,959 --> 02:59:45,602
MARISHA: For bonus added safety in case this
bridge gives way, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine

2348
02:59:45,602 --> 02:59:52,743
and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the
bridge. Further enforce it.

2349
02:59:52,743 --> 02:59:59,324
MATT: The vines reach around and wrap around the
edges of the wood slats and the rope handholds,

2350
02:59:59,324 --> 03:00:01,379
and it seems to be pretty well-held on that side.

2351
03:00:01,379 --> 03:00:02,703
TALIESIN: Clever!

2352
03:00:02,703 --> 03:00:08,669
MARISHA: At least that side will be fine. And then
I'll go across.

2353
03:00:08,669 --> 03:00:12,239
MATT: Cool, you make it across without a problem.

2354
03:00:12,239 --> 03:00:14,339
TRAVIS: Who else needs to go across?

2355
03:00:14,339 --> 03:00:18,791
LAURA: Just you and Tiberius and Trinket.

2356
03:00:18,791 --> 03:00:20,377
TRAVIS: You want me to go first?

2357
03:00:20,377 --> 03:00:28,142
ORION: It's fine! I hop on Trinket and I pet
Lockheed. And then I hop on Trinket and I cast Fly

2358
03:00:28,183 --> 03:00:34,243
on him and say, Remember how to go across. 
And then as we start flying

2359
03:00:34,243 --> 03:00:40,056
across, I cast Telekinesis on Grog and take him
with me. Kind of like Green Lantern.

2360
03:00:40,056 --> 03:00:43,433
MARISHA: Concentration spells.

2361
03:00:43,433 --> 03:00:48,061
ORION: Yeah. That should be 12 seconds to get across
a bridge, right?

2362
03:00:48,061 --> 03:00:52,596
MATT: Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will
be enough time. So as you're coasting over with

2363
03:00:52,596 --> 03:00:57,314
Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around
and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden,

2364
03:00:57,314 --> 03:01:01,268
you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down
over yourself, waving your hands instinctually.

2365
03:01:01,268 --> 03:01:06,560
Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop
before the rock comes to a point which would probably

2366
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:12,641
splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and
then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little

2367
03:01:12,641 --> 03:01:16,224
scary, but you start flailing about as you're
being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually,

2368
03:01:16,224 --> 03:01:23,297
Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You
guide Grog over, down onto his feet. Safe and

2369
03:01:23,297 --> 03:01:24,327
sound.

2370
03:01:24,327 --> 03:01:25,526
MARISHA: Who's left?

2371
03:01:25,526 --> 03:01:27,083
SAM: No one. The horses.

2372
03:01:27,083 --> 03:01:30,216
LAURA: Oh yeah, what do you want to do with the
horses?

2373
03:01:30,216 --> 03:01:31,553
TRAVIS: We tied them up.

2374
03:01:31,553 --> 03:01:36,325
ORION: I'm going to dispel the Fly. But I'm going
to hold the Telekinesis for the ten minutes I can

2375
03:01:36,325 --> 03:01:40,254
on Grog. I'm not going to do anything, I'm just
going to keep that spell going.

2376
03:01:40,254 --> 03:01:43,839
MATT: Okay. Cool. All righty.

2377
03:01:43,839 --> 03:01:47,330
SAM: I say a prayer of thanks to the horses, who
will surely die of starvation.

2378
03:01:47,330 --> 03:01:56,192
LAURA: They were tied up in a super grassy area
with a shit-ton of water around.

2379
03:01:56,192 --> 03:02:00,273
LIAM: They'll be eaten by something long before
that. It's fine.

2380
03:02:00,273 --> 03:02:03,932
MARISHA: So what's our plan? What are we doing?

2381
03:02:03,932 --> 03:02:06,364
SAM: The plan is walk until we get there.

2382
03:02:06,364 --> 03:02:12,283
MATT: The path pinches a little bit tighter as you
go across, about a ten foot width and you guys

2383
03:02:12,283 --> 03:02:19,489
begin pulling across. There's a sudden large gust
of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and

2384
03:02:19,489 --> 03:02:23,427
buckle down to hold on. I'd like you all to roll
an athletics check.

2385
03:02:23,427 --> 03:02:26,526
LAURA: Are we in mountains yet? So I have
advantage?

2386
03:02:26,526 --> 03:02:28,096
MATT: You have advantage on it.

2387
03:02:28,096 --> 03:02:29,738
TRAVIS: Me too, because mountains are my
favorite--

2388
03:02:29,738 --> 03:02:31,029
MATT: That's true, yeah!

2389
03:02:31,029 --> 03:02:34,282
LAURA: What is this, acrobatics?

2390
03:02:34,282 --> 03:02:36,259
SAM and LAURA: Athletics.

2391
03:02:36,259 --> 03:02:37,487
SAM: Nine.

2392
03:02:37,487 --> 03:02:39,232
ORION. 18.

2393
03:02:39,232 --> 03:02:40,341
MARISHA: 19.

2394
03:02:40,341 --> 03:02:41,431
TALIESIN: Ten.

2395
03:02:41,431 --> 03:02:43,454
LAURA: 11.

2396
03:02:43,454 --> 03:02:44,394
TRAVIS: 23.

2397
03:02:44,394 --> 03:02:51,388
MATT: All right, as you guys are holding tight,
both Scanlan and Vax are trying to grab something,

2398
03:02:51,388 --> 03:02:54,976
holding onto rocks, but before they can get
enough, they're both so small, it pushes them

2399
03:02:54,976 --> 03:02:55,903
out.

2400
03:02:55,903 --> 03:02:57,810
ORION: How much time has passed?

2401
03:02:57,810 --> 03:03:03,005
MATT: It's three seconds. Oh! Passed since the
bridge? About five, six minutes.

2402
03:03:03,005 --> 03:03:06,702
ORION: Can I try to catch them because I still
have the Telekinesis going?

2403
03:03:06,702 --> 03:03:08,715
MATT: You can catch one of them.

2404
03:03:08,715 --> 03:03:10,992
ORION: (yelling) Why, Matthew?!

2405
03:03:10,992 --> 03:03:13,183
MATT: Because the spell has to be directed!

2406
03:03:13,183 --> 03:03:14,748
MARISHA: Are they flying off a cliff?

2407
03:03:14,748 --> 03:03:18,571
MATT: They're both being dragged by the wind off
the side of the cliff. You can see them grabbing

2408
03:03:18,571 --> 03:03:22,800
the ground. Vax is being pulled off the side as
Scanlan is actually lifted off his feet.

2409
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,577
ORION: I know Vax can't. I grab Vax!

2410
03:03:24,577 --> 03:03:26,272
LIAM: Tell my sister I love her!

2411
03:03:26,272 --> 03:03:28,286
TRAVIS: I jump and try and grab Vex.

2412
03:03:28,286 --> 03:03:31,745
LAURA: Vax. You want to hold me?

2413
03:03:31,745 --> 03:03:33,022
LIAM: I'm Vox.

2414
03:03:33,022 --> 03:03:34,536
ORION: Wait, you're grabbing him?

2415
03:03:34,536 --> 03:03:36,415
LAURA: I'm Vex.

2416
03:03:36,415 --> 03:03:37,840
TRAVIS: That's what I said!

2417
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:44,064
MATT: You grab Vax and hold him in place as you
reach out and grab Vax by the arms and pull him

2418
03:03:44,064 --> 03:03:45,270
back onto--

2419
03:03:45,270 --> 03:03:46,352
LIAM: Wait, who?

2420
03:03:46,352 --> 03:03:47,244
ORION: You!

2421
03:03:47,244 --> 03:03:48,475
LIAM: Oh, <i>he</i> grabs me!

2422
03:03:48,475 --> 03:03:49,439
TRAVIS: I grab her.

2423
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:50,713
LAURA: Grog grabbed me.

2424
03:03:50,713 --> 03:03:53,721
MATT: You were fine.

2425
03:03:53,721 --> 03:03:55,669
LAURA: I know. But he still said he'd grabbed me.

2426
03:03:55,669 --> 03:04:01,746
MATT: Okay. Then you're being held aloft by
Tiberius' Telekinesis concentrating. Scanlan has

2427
03:04:01,746 --> 03:04:03,061
fallen out of view.

2428
03:04:03,061 --> 03:04:04,858
MARISHA: I Grasping Vine him before he goes out of
view.

2429
03:04:04,858 --> 03:04:08,308
MATT: Okay. It's all right.

2430
03:04:08,308 --> 03:04:11,004
MARISHA: Off the side of the cliff.

2431
03:04:11,004 --> 03:04:14,010
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack roll with your
Grasping Vine.

2432
03:04:14,010 --> 03:04:16,318
ORION: I can manipulate a thousand pounds.

2433
03:04:16,318 --> 03:04:17,299
LIAM: You've got me.

2434
03:04:17,299 --> 03:04:18,489
MARISHA: What?!

2435
03:04:18,489 --> 03:04:20,824
MATT: This is to aim the vine as he falls.

2436
03:04:20,824 --> 03:04:21,953
MARISHA: 19.

2437
03:04:21,953 --> 03:04:27,808
MATT: 19? Not a problem! The vine grabs Scanlan
and pulls him back and holds him as the wind

2438
03:04:27,808 --> 03:04:29,335
slowly dies down.

2439
03:04:29,335 --> 03:04:32,786
ORION: I guide Vax back to the cliff.

2440
03:04:32,786 --> 03:04:39,321
MATT: The wind dies down. You guys now begin
pushing yourselves close to the edge of this

2441
03:04:39,321 --> 03:04:44,459
pathway up the side of this seaside cliff. It
doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot

2442
03:04:44,459 --> 03:04:48,672
width now, which puts you all at general unease.
As the sun's getting closer and closer to setting,

2443
03:04:48,672 --> 03:04:51,968
you're making your way around the crest. You've
been traveling this mountain range for a good

2444
03:04:51,968 --> 03:04:57,014
number of hours now. You're at a decent height,
you're on foot, a good distance inside the

2445
03:04:57,014 --> 03:05:01,974
Alabaster Sierra mountain range. Perception check,
everyone.

2446
03:05:01,974 --> 03:05:05,675
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2447
03:05:05,675 --> 03:05:07,023
TRAVIS: Five.

2448
03:05:07,023 --> 03:05:08,102
SAM: Four.

2449
03:05:08,102 --> 03:05:09,359
MATT: Three, two, one.

2450
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:10,667
MARISHA: 25.

2451
03:05:10,667 --> 03:05:11,678
TALIESIN: 26.

2452
03:05:11,678 --> 03:05:12,969
LIAM: 29.

2453
03:05:12,969 --> 03:05:14,133
LAURA: 25.

2454
03:05:14,133 --> 03:05:16,546
ORION: I rolled a natural one, with negative two.

2455
03:05:16,546 --> 03:05:24,493
MATT: Okay! Those of you with a higher perception
than 20 on this roll. As you pull along, you hear

2456
03:05:24,493 --> 03:05:33,714
this echoing sound, this (bird-like sounds) in the
distance, the wind's carrying it as it's blowing

2457
03:05:33,714 --> 03:05:34,866
past you.

2458
03:05:34,866 --> 03:05:38,697
MARISHA: Does it sounds like anything
nature-based? Something I could possibly have

2459
03:05:38,697 --> 03:05:40,036
talked to in the past?

2460
03:05:40,036 --> 03:05:41,560
TALIESIN: Is it something I would know?

2461
03:05:41,560 --> 03:05:48,150
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check. You
go ahead and make a nature check.

2462
03:05:48,150 --> 03:05:51,467
TALIESIN: 21.

2463
03:05:51,467 --> 03:05:52,734
MARISHA: 25.

2464
03:05:52,734 --> 03:06:00,515
MATT: It is birdish in nature, but it sounds too
guttural and too articulate to be a bird. There is

2465
03:06:00,515 --> 03:06:06,236
enough of-- you notice there's a language of the
chittering that is bird-like, but there is actual

2466
03:06:06,236 --> 03:06:13,996
voice. You recall that there are various creatures
that make the cliffsides home. One of the ones

2467
03:06:13,996 --> 03:06:17,866
that are more obnoxious that some of the earlier
traders of Whitestone had problems with making

2468
03:06:17,866 --> 03:06:21,540
this path for mining were clusters of harpies.

2469
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:23,917
MARISHA: Oh, fucking harpies.

2470
03:06:23,917 --> 03:06:25,323
TALIESIN and ORION: Harpies.

2471
03:06:25,323 --> 03:06:29,284
ORION: They're the opposite of the Harpers, which
are good.

2472
03:06:29,284 --> 03:06:31,789
TRAVIS: What's a harpy?

2473
03:06:31,789 --> 03:06:35,498
ORION: A harpy's a jerk, a stupid butthole who's
super loud.

2474
03:06:35,498 --> 03:06:39,925
MATT: You glance over as you guys are having this
conversation. Behind you, you can see in the

2475
03:06:39,925 --> 03:06:44,814
distance from where you were, a couple of these
dark shapes swooping down. You see a cluster of

2476
03:06:44,814 --> 03:06:46,591
about four or five of these harpies diving.

2477
03:06:46,591 --> 03:06:48,962
TALIESIN: Can we find a place to maybe settle
down?

2478
03:06:48,962 --> 03:06:53,409
LAURA: Can we stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace
on us!

2479
03:06:53,409 --> 03:06:55,439
SAM: Don't worry! I can make us all look like cows
again!

2480
03:06:55,439 --> 03:06:57,816
MARISHA: (shushes) Everyone be quiet!

2481
03:06:57,816 --> 03:07:01,059
MATT How long is the concentration on Pass Without
a Trace? How long can you hold that

2482
03:07:01,059 --> 03:07:02,526
concentration?

2483
03:07:02,526 --> 03:07:05,792
LAURA: Up to one hour.

2484
03:07:05,792 --> 03:07:08,741
MATT: Okay. It has faded since then.

2485
03:07:08,741 --> 03:07:13,072
MARISHA: Where are we against the mountain? Are we
still on the mountain edge?

2486
03:07:13,072 --> 03:07:15,900
MATT: Yeah, you're still on the path, and you look
back from where you came from.

2487
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:18,564
MARISHA: So we have a mountain behind our backs?

2488
03:07:18,564 --> 03:07:20,277
MATT: Yeah, a sheer cliff.

2489
03:07:20,277 --> 03:07:27,141
MARISHA: I turn around and I cast Move Earth, my
6th-level fucker. And I (boof) and I clear out a

2490
03:07:27,141 --> 03:07:28,632
cave.

2491
03:07:28,632 --> 03:07:33,753
MATT: Okay. As you're concentrating on this,
eventually, Keyleth begins to focus, and over the

2492
03:07:33,753 --> 03:07:36,839
next minute or so, she begins to push a cavern.

2493
03:07:36,839 --> 03:07:38,601
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us now.

2494
03:07:38,601 --> 03:07:43,180
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, you can see the
harpies have definitely found some sort of prey.

2495
03:07:43,180 --> 03:07:47,298
They're distracted as they're slowly tearing apart
what you gather are the horses you left behind.

2496
03:07:47,298 --> 03:07:50,236
LAURA: Oh no! Terrible!

2497
03:07:50,236 --> 03:07:57,186
MATT: Yeah. Good news is, they're distracted.

2498
03:07:57,246 --> 03:07:59,666
MARISHA: Horses saved our lives, guys.

2499
03:07:59,666 --> 03:08:03,190
MATT: Bad news is they're probably not going
to be there when you come back.

2500
03:08:03,190 --> 03:08:05,529
TALIESIN: It's getting dark. I think we should
camp.

2501
03:08:05,529 --> 03:08:07,582
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

2502
03:08:07,582 --> 03:08:14,525
MATT: Over the next few minutes or so, Keyleth,
you've pushed a good ten by 15-foot cavern into

2503
03:08:14,525 --> 03:08:19,777
the side of this wall that didn't previously
exist. You guys are able to step out of the light

2504
03:08:19,777 --> 03:08:25,024
as the sun's starting to disappear over the
mountain range, the Cliffkeep, which you can see

2505
03:08:25,024 --> 03:08:28,166
in the distance across this channel now. There's a
channel of water between the two.

2506
03:08:28,166 --> 03:08:33,454
MARISHA: I go ahead and Druidcraft a little
campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for

2507
03:08:33,454 --> 03:08:34,488
us?

2508
03:08:34,488 --> 03:08:39,110
LAURA: I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm
going to see if I can do this. That sort of

2509
03:08:39,110 --> 03:08:43,881
ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to
where they wouldn't be able to see it.

2510
03:08:43,881 --> 03:08:48,470
MATT: Sure! Go ahead and make a stealth check.

2511
03:08:48,470 --> 03:08:54,335
LAURA: 28.

2512
03:08:54,335 --> 03:09:00,797
MATT: Okay! You take the next 15 minutes or so,
finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks

2513
03:09:00,797 --> 03:09:05,595
that have been loosely around the area and you
start setting up this pattern of them that closes

2514
03:09:05,595 --> 03:09:11,782
off some of the entrance from the smooth
opening that Keyleth had created. It takes a

2515
03:09:11,782 --> 03:09:15,530
little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening,
and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things

2516
03:09:15,614 --> 03:09:19,476
around. But you feel you've managed to mask it to
the point that to a distant eye it would be hard

2517
03:09:19,476 --> 03:09:24,753
to see that there is an actual cavern there. At
this point, the sun has set, night has come in,

2518
03:09:24,753 --> 03:09:28,636
and you guys are sitting within this cavern
hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves

2519
03:09:28,636 --> 03:09:32,990
crashing against the bottom of these cliffside,
coastal fjords.

2520
03:09:32,990 --> 03:09:34,760
MARISHA: Me and Tiberius made a fire.

2521
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:36,207
MATT: All right, a fire is made.

2522
03:09:36,207 --> 03:09:38,027
ORION: I lit it with my spitting.

2523
03:09:38,027 --> 03:09:45,650
MATT: Okay. Tiberius forms a relatively useful and
effective campfire within this cave.

2524
03:09:45,650 --> 03:09:54,997
LAURA: Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a
couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can

2525
03:09:54,997 --> 03:09:57,195
make three based on what we've done before.

2526
03:09:57,195 --> 03:10:00,325
MATT: You can, yes. Do be aware, the holy oil will
only last about a day.

2527
03:10:00,325 --> 03:10:04,038
LAURA: Oh, really? Oh, so I'll do that right
before.

2528
03:10:04,038 --> 03:10:08,179
MATT: It's one of those things where if you dip it
now and leave it, over time it'll just either

2529
03:10:08,179 --> 03:10:11,537
evaporate or drip off of the arrow.

2530
03:10:11,537 --> 03:10:13,125
LAURA: Good to know.

2531
03:10:13,125 --> 03:10:18,129
LIAM: While my sister's looking at her shit, I
bogart Trinket and climb up onto him, use him like a

2532
03:10:18,129 --> 03:10:23,334
sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm
parts and fall asleep.

2533
03:10:23,334 --> 03:10:27,024
MATT: (bear groaning) Trinket, at first, just
haplessly pushes you away, but recognizes your

2534
03:10:27,024 --> 03:10:28,372
scent and lets you.

2535
03:10:28,372 --> 03:10:29,917
LAURA: You ganked my sleeping bag.

2536
03:10:29,917 --> 03:10:31,679
LIAM: Sorry, not sorry.

2537
03:10:31,679 --> 03:10:39,506
ORION: I find a little patch of dust and do a
little dust bath real quick and then I'm going to

2538
03:10:39,506 --> 03:10:46,355
use one of my books of stuffs and start
researching liches just because I want to.

2539
03:10:46,355 --> 03:10:54,161
MATT: Okay. I mean, what book would you be
researching this in?

2540
03:10:54,161 --> 03:10:57,905
ORION: Tobin's Spirit Guide?

2541
03:10:57,905 --> 03:11:02,447
MATT: The researcher ability is that you can go to
places of research and find books. You don't

2542
03:11:02,447 --> 03:11:06,881
really keep a tome of all knowledge with you. The
next time you find a town or you're in town, then you

2543
03:11:06,969 --> 03:11:09,042
can use that ability to research in advance.

2544
03:11:09,042 --> 03:11:12,005
LAURA: I ask Grog how he's doing.

2545
03:11:12,005 --> 03:11:14,351
TRAVIS: I'm bored as shit.

2546
03:11:14,351 --> 03:11:16,401
LAURA: You want to arm wrestle?

2547
03:11:16,401 --> 03:11:17,483
TRAVIS: No.

2548
03:11:17,483 --> 03:11:19,285
LAURA: All right.

2549
03:11:19,285 --> 03:11:24,301
SAM: Come on, do it, Grog! Come on, you can't beat
a girl?

2550
03:11:24,301 --> 03:11:27,507
MATT: Do you guys all rest for the evening?

2551
03:11:27,507 --> 03:11:29,275
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

2552
03:11:29,275 --> 03:11:31,020
LAURA: But we should take watch.

2553
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:36,267
TALIESIN: I'm still awake. I'm going to fall
asleep last.

2554
03:11:36,267 --> 03:11:39,167
MARISHA: I also stay up with Percy.

2555
03:11:39,167 --> 03:11:40,398
MATT: Okay.

2556
03:11:40,398 --> 03:11:42,511
SAM: I'll take first watch.

2557
03:11:42,511 --> 03:11:45,084
LAURA: Wake me up when you're tired.

2558
03:11:45,084 --> 03:11:46,712
ORION: I'm gonna feed Lockheed some treats.

2559
03:11:46,712 --> 03:11:51,065
MATT: Okay. You guys continue your business for
the evening.

2560
03:11:51,065 --> 03:11:57,552
MARISHA: I talk to Percy for a second. Percy,
while we're alone for a moment, there's something

2561
03:11:57,552 --> 03:12:04,409
that's been bothering me, and I can't get it out
of my head. I thought I'd talk to you about it

2562
03:12:04,409 --> 03:12:10,192
because I feel-- we're friends, right? We're
friends? Are we friends?

2563
03:12:10,192 --> 03:12:13,061
TALIESIN: Sure! I'd like to think so, yes.

2564
03:12:13,061 --> 03:12:15,902
MARISHA: Been through a lot, been together a
while.

2565
03:12:15,902 --> 03:12:17,622
TALIESIN: It's been a while, yes.

2566
03:12:17,622 --> 03:12:18,907
MARISHA: Two years now?

2567
03:12:18,907 --> 03:12:20,502
TALIESIN: I suppose.

2568
03:12:20,502 --> 03:12:23,604
SAM: I go invisible to see if I can hear their
conversation.

2569
03:12:23,604 --> 03:12:26,826
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

2570
03:12:26,826 --> 03:12:30,075
SAM: Perception or stealth? 20.

2571
03:12:30,075 --> 03:12:38,423
MATT: Okay. You are keeping relatively low and are
able to overhear their conversation.

2572
03:12:38,423 --> 03:12:43,187
MARISHA: You know, you're a very brilliant
person.

2573
03:12:43,187 --> 03:12:45,124
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2574
03:12:45,124 --> 03:12:54,698
MARISHA: I can't help but feel like I'm being
watched right now. Never mind, forget I said

2575
03:12:54,698 --> 03:13:06,582
anything. I can't help but feel like there's
something else, there's something more to this

2576
03:13:06,582 --> 03:13:13,745
that you're not telling us. And I didn't really
think of anything until we were having that fight

2577
03:13:13,745 --> 03:13:16,382
where Tiberius brutally murdered that old woman.

2578
03:13:16,382 --> 03:13:19,961
TALIESIN: Been trying not to think about it.

2579
03:13:19,961 --> 03:13:26,831
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. But the one thing that I
can't get out of my head was something that you

2580
03:13:26,831 --> 03:13:37,699
said during that fight. And for a long time I was
like, damn, Percy's got really cool one-liners and

2581
03:13:37,699 --> 03:13:42,562
he's so smart, and I wish I could have cool
one-liners. You and Grog have really cool

2582
03:13:42,562 --> 03:13:54,109
one-liners. And then you said "your soul is now
forfeit" to the person you shot that night. And I

2583
03:13:54,109 --> 03:13:58,566
thought, wow! That was an interesting one-liner.

2584
03:13:58,566 --> 03:14:01,133
TALIESIN: I did say that, didn't I?

2585
03:14:01,133 --> 03:14:06,655
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah, you did. For some reason, I
was the only one who noticed it, and I don't know

2586
03:14:06,655 --> 03:14:16,243
if that's because I'm just reading into things, if
that was just a really awesome, but scary and

2587
03:14:16,243 --> 03:14:26,784
brutal thing to say in the moment, or if there's
something deeper that you might be serving.

2588
03:14:26,784 --> 03:14:34,654
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'll say, I've had a number of
years thinking about what I would do and what I

2589
03:14:34,654 --> 03:14:44,185
would say and how I would go about this. This kind
of obsession is not healthy, and I know that, and

2590
03:14:44,185 --> 03:14:52,165
it's no way to live. And I'm sure that was
something on the list of things I thought I would

2591
03:14:52,165 --> 03:15:03,255
say, some attempt to be scary when I met them, as
opposed to being scared, I think I was-- (sighs)

2592
03:15:03,255 --> 03:15:10,916
again, I don't really remember much because I was
so angry. I've never been so angry. And I think I

2593
03:15:10,916 --> 03:15:19,246
was just trying to sound threatening. And I'd had
these dreams before, you know I've-- you don't build

2594
03:15:19,246 --> 03:15:26,761
anything like this without the knowledge that
you're-- I'm aware that inventing this thing has

2595
03:15:26,761 --> 03:15:28,684
been a mistake.

2596
03:15:28,684 --> 03:15:30,231
MARISHA: What thing?

2597
03:15:30,231 --> 03:15:32,451
TALIESIN: I pull out my gun.

2598
03:15:32,451 --> 03:15:39,516
MARISHA: Wait, what are you saying? You had
knowledge? You didn't build that without

2599
03:15:39,516 --> 03:15:41,376
inspiration? What do you mean?

2600
03:15:41,376 --> 03:15:48,522
TALIESIN: I've had thoughts about it, but I didn't
really think about what I was doing or what I was

2601
03:15:48,522 --> 03:15:55,418
going to build until I decided to take my revenge,
and I'd never thought about building it because I

2602
03:15:55,418 --> 03:16:04,018
realized what a dangerous idea it was. (sighs) And
I fear for the day that that comes back to haunt

2603
03:16:04,018 --> 03:16:12,745
me. I don't know what I'll do, but I don't know, I
think I was just trying to say something to be

2604
03:16:12,745 --> 03:16:17,224
intimidating. I honestly didn't even think I was
going to kill him, it just happened.

2605
03:16:17,224 --> 03:16:19,960
MARISHA: Can I see if he's lying to me?

2606
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:22,613
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

2607
03:16:22,613 --> 03:16:29,131
MARISHA: 17.

2608
03:16:29,131 --> 03:16:31,471
MATT: 17. Roll a d20.

2609
03:16:31,471 --> 03:16:33,163
TALIESIN: Is your insight really that good?

2610
03:16:33,163 --> 03:16:34,866
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm wise as fuck!

2611
03:16:34,866 --> 03:16:37,577
MATT: And add your charisma modifier.

2612
03:16:37,577 --> 03:16:42,020
TALIESIN: Add my charisma modifier? 18.

2613
03:16:42,020 --> 03:16:51,622
MATT: Best you can tell, he's seeming honest, and
sharing open-hearted to you. You feel like you've

2614
03:16:51,622 --> 03:16:54,877
really gotten to the core truth of what Percy's
about.

2615
03:16:54,877 --> 03:16:56,622
MARISHA: What? What did you say?

2616
03:16:56,622 --> 03:16:58,938
MATT: You feel like you've gotten to the core and
truth of what Percy's about, and perhaps your

2617
03:16:58,938 --> 03:17:04,742
questioning this has upset him, and you feel like
maybe you've pushed this a little too far.

2618
03:17:04,742 --> 03:17:16,189
TALIESIN: I do regret what happened and I know he
was a bad man, but I still hope to never lose my

2619
03:17:16,189 --> 03:17:18,040
temper like that again.

2620
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:20,641
LIAM: Got to roleplay that shit. He convinced
you.

2621
03:17:20,641 --> 03:17:27,620
MARISHA: I still really feel like we're being
watched. Do you feel that? I don't know.

2622
03:17:27,620 --> 03:17:30,321
TALIESIN: Honestly, I think we both need sleep.

2623
03:17:30,321 --> 03:17:33,456
MARISHA: It's really distracting. Yeah. Well, I
love you.

2624
03:17:33,456 --> 03:17:34,925
TALIESIN: I love you, too.

2625
03:17:34,925 --> 03:17:37,635
MARISHA: We're in this with you until this end.

2626
03:17:37,635 --> 03:17:39,103
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2627
03:17:39,103 --> 03:17:41,561
MARISHA: Let's sleep.

2628
03:17:41,561 --> 03:17:48,229
MATT: Okay. You guys, through your turns, the
evening goes by uneventful. Morning comes to you.

2629
03:17:48,229 --> 03:17:54,222
You can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking
you up as the heat from the morning sun begins to

2630
03:17:54,222 --> 03:17:57,858
eventually hit this side of the cave. Since you're
on this side of the mountain, by the time you wake

2631
03:17:57,858 --> 03:18:01,089
up, you realize the hour's probably a little bit
past noon.

2632
03:18:01,089 --> 03:18:02,398
LAURA: Oh shit.

2633
03:18:02,398 --> 03:18:04,310
MARISHA: We overslept!

2634
03:18:04,310 --> 03:18:07,125
ORION: It's so dark in here, because of the cave
thing.

2635
03:18:07,125 --> 03:18:11,189
MARISHA: Okay, so wait. Percy, how much further
out are we from Whitestone?

2636
03:18:11,189 --> 03:18:18,377
MATT: You gather you probably have about a day's
worth of travel, and you'll be able to make your

2637
03:18:18,377 --> 03:18:22,486
way down into the ravine from here. You've come up
quite a bit of the mountain range.

2638
03:18:22,486 --> 03:18:26,434
TALIESIN: Probably another day before we can camp
close enough to attack.

2639
03:18:26,434 --> 03:18:28,734
SAM: Let's get going.

2640
03:18:28,734 --> 03:18:32,154
LAURA: Should we stealth through the mountains,
just in case they have any kind of lookouts?

2641
03:18:32,154 --> 03:18:33,752
ORION: Oh, they will have lookouts.

2642
03:18:33,752 --> 03:18:36,520
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again.

2643
03:18:36,520 --> 03:18:37,912
LIAM: Let's go slower.

2644
03:18:37,912 --> 03:18:40,397
LAURA: Should we all stealth? Try at least?

2645
03:18:40,397 --> 03:18:41,540
LIAM: Yes.

2646
03:18:41,540 --> 03:18:43,003
TALIESIN: Let's keep stealthy.

2647
03:18:43,003 --> 03:18:48,112
MATT: Okay. You guys gather outside of the cavern
and head up, continuing along this path.

2648
03:18:48,112 --> 03:18:59,251
Eventually, you do notice that the path becomes
broken and too steep to continue. It actually

2649
03:18:59,251 --> 03:19:06,410
falls and tumbles down into this long, sliding
ravine. There is a slight rockslide trail that

2650
03:19:06,410 --> 03:19:10,939
you could climb up and over and it looks like
there is a separate ravine, or a separation where

2651
03:19:10,939 --> 03:19:15,338
the two mountains join, that could possibly be
traversed. But continuing on the seaside path is

2652
03:19:15,338 --> 03:19:19,709
not going to work. It does bring you inward
towards-- maybe a little further south than you

2653
03:19:19,709 --> 03:19:23,554
would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance
into Whitestone, but it's about your only path.

2654
03:19:23,554 --> 03:19:26,286
TALIESIN: Have I walked this path before? I never
walked this path at all.

2655
03:19:26,286 --> 03:19:31,633
MATT: You would have had no reason to walk this
path. You've heard about it, you know of this side

2656
03:19:31,633 --> 03:19:34,927
of the mountain range, but based on your history,
there's no reason you would have come here.

2657
03:19:34,927 --> 03:19:37,470
ORION: Whatever it takes to get to that back
door.

2658
03:19:37,470 --> 03:19:40,478
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, by the way.
Just so we're aware of what your stealth rolls are

2659
03:19:40,478 --> 03:19:42,168
with the Pass Without a Trace.

2660
03:19:42,168 --> 03:19:43,494
LAURA: Add ten to it.

2661
03:19:43,494 --> 03:19:45,687
LIAM: You get ten? Oh. Well, I got a 40, then.

2662
03:19:45,687 --> 03:19:46,494
MATT: Okay.

2663
03:19:46,494 --> 03:19:47,218
SAM: 27

2664
03:19:47,218 --> 03:19:48,198
MATT: 27.

2665
03:19:48,198 --> 03:19:50,599
ORION: Nine.

2666
03:19:50,599 --> 03:19:52,327
MATT: With the ten?

2667
03:19:52,327 --> 03:19:53,739
ORION: Oh, 19.

2668
03:19:53,739 --> 03:19:54,940
MARISHA: 32.

2669
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:55,991
TALIESIN: 32.

2670
03:19:55,991 --> 03:19:56,880
TRAVIS: 27.

2671
03:19:56,880 --> 03:19:57,859
LAURA: 37.

2672
03:19:57,859 --> 03:20:02,448
MATT: That's a pretty good spread. So you guys,
you've hit the edge of the path. Are you heading

2673
03:20:02,448 --> 03:20:04,012
up the rockslide trail?

2674
03:20:04,012 --> 03:20:04,941
LAURA: Yes.

2675
03:20:04,941 --> 03:20:08,104
MATT: Okay. You all, one by one, begin to climb
over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath

2676
03:20:08,104 --> 03:20:10,608
your feet, grasp. And you help each other get to
the very top.

2677
03:20:10,608 --> 03:20:12,277
ORION: I use my Mage Hand to help.

2678
03:20:12,277 --> 03:20:15,034
MATT: (laughs) That's adorable.

2679
03:20:15,034 --> 03:20:19,110
(laughter)

2680
03:20:19,110 --> 03:20:22,348
LAURA: As he looks at the clock! "That's
adorable."

2681
03:20:22,348 --> 03:20:28,326
MATT: So you all eventually manage to make it over
the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it

2682
03:20:28,326 --> 03:20:33,860
leads you to where these two large mountains come
together, and there is a small path that leads

2683
03:20:33,860 --> 03:20:38,124
between. It winds and travels downward. You can
see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled, and

2684
03:20:38,124 --> 03:20:41,719
there are small boulders and such that just, over
time and through erosion, have tumbled down this

2685
03:20:41,719 --> 03:20:48,568
ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks
of stone. You begin walking through this ravine

2686
03:20:48,568 --> 03:20:52,905
for another good 45 minutes to an hour, keeping a
keen eye out.

2687
03:20:52,905 --> 03:21:02,457
ORION: Is this the same ravine that we're
travelling across?

2688
03:21:02,457 --> 03:21:06,737
MATT: Basically, you guys have been traveling up
the side of the coast. You've now turned inward

2689
03:21:06,737 --> 03:21:11,031
over the mountain range to head down into the
valley of Whitestone. You are currently just now

2690
03:21:11,031 --> 03:21:13,758
heading up through the mountain range, inwards
towards the mountain.

2691
03:21:13,758 --> 03:21:15,429
TALIESIN: Is this the river?

2692
03:21:15,429 --> 03:21:20,516
MATT: There's no river here. It's just stone that
comes together for a pathway in between. This is

2693
03:21:20,516 --> 03:21:23,239
where two large peaks of the mountains basically
come to join at the bottom.

2694
03:21:23,239 --> 03:21:24,723
TALIESIN: Okay, so we're not at the river.

2695
03:21:24,723 --> 03:21:30,086
MATT: No, the river is actually inside the valley
and to the south of Whitestone. So pressing down I

2696
03:21:30,086 --> 03:21:31,957
would like you all to roll a perception check.

2697
03:21:31,957 --> 03:21:33,317
LAURA: Jesus.

2698
03:21:33,317 --> 03:21:35,264
MARISHA: Ah, that's all right.

2699
03:21:35,264 --> 03:21:36,286
SAM: One!

2700
03:21:36,286 --> 03:21:37,522
LAURA: Natural 20!

2701
03:21:37,522 --> 03:21:38,849
LIAM: Natural 20!

2702
03:21:38,849 --> 03:21:40,691
LIAM: Yeah!

2703
03:21:40,691 --> 03:21:43,304
MATT: One, one, 20, 20.

2704
03:21:43,304 --> 03:21:44,449
ORION: 16.

2705
03:21:44,449 --> 03:21:45,419
MARISHA: 14.

2706
03:21:45,419 --> 03:21:46,388
TALIESIN: 16.

2707
03:21:46,388 --> 03:21:52,727
MATT: Okay. As all of you guys are charging
forward, both Vex and Vax, you hear this slight

2708
03:21:52,727 --> 03:21:58,845
noise of a couple rocks (clattering) in the ravine
behind you. You both turn and look and for a split

2709
03:21:58,845 --> 03:22:05,638
second you swear you see between some of the rocks
and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of

2710
03:22:05,638 --> 03:22:11,542
this ravine, you see a quick blur of blue that
vanishes behind a higher platform above you.

2711
03:22:11,542 --> 03:22:14,815
LIAM: Smurfs!

2712
03:22:14,815 --> 03:22:16,878
LAURA: A blur of blue?

2713
03:22:16,878 --> 03:22:22,453
MATT: A large blur of blue just disappears behind
one of the outcroppings that's blocking your view

2714
03:22:22,453 --> 03:22:23,711
of higher up the ravine.

2715
03:22:23,711 --> 03:22:26,353
LAURA: (shushes) Down. Hide.

2716
03:22:26,353 --> 03:22:28,276
ORION: I cast Stoneskin.

2717
03:22:28,276 --> 03:22:29,774
MATT: Okay.

2718
03:22:29,774 --> 03:22:30,887
LIAM: Stealth.

2719
03:22:30,887 --> 03:22:35,664
ORION: I fasten my Cloak of Displacement.

2720
03:22:35,664 --> 03:22:37,614
LAURA: And I prepare--

2721
03:22:37,614 --> 03:22:41,738
MATT: You guys prepare for a second, and as you're
all paying attention, you guys also see another

2722
03:22:41,738 --> 03:22:46,571
shift of blue (whoosh) go across the way. And this
time you see it's something large and blue that

2723
03:22:46,571 --> 03:22:51,409
moves across the stone and goes into a small
cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way that's

2724
03:22:51,409 --> 03:22:54,352
just past your visual range from this low in the
ravine.

2725
03:22:54,352 --> 03:22:57,071
LAURA: Do we have any visual on what it could be?

2726
03:22:57,071 --> 03:23:03,355
MATT: It moved very quickly, and for a split
second, you could see it appeared to be-- the way

2727
03:23:03,355 --> 03:23:09,201
it moved was almost serpentine, like (whoosh) and
vanished inside. You swear you saw limbs, though.

2728
03:23:09,201 --> 03:23:11,888
It wasn't a giant snake. There was something
attached to it.

2729
03:23:11,888 --> 03:23:19,640
LAURA: (whispering) Wyvern? I look at Keyleth.
Keyleth. (louder) And I whisper, but for sake of

2730
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:27,954
microphones, do you know of a creature that's
blue, and fast, and is kind of snakey but has arms

2731
03:23:27,954 --> 03:23:29,318
and legs?

2732
03:23:29,318 --> 03:23:35,552
MARISHA: Let me think about it for a second. Do I
know a creature that's blue and snakey?

2733
03:23:35,552 --> 03:23:38,517
LIAM: It sounds like basilisks, but they're too
slow.

2734
03:23:38,517 --> 03:23:40,379
MATT: What did you roll?

2735
03:23:40,379 --> 03:23:42,781
MARISHA: I don't know. Ooh, that's 24.

2736
03:23:42,781 --> 03:23:50,975
MATT: 24. You've heard of various lizard-like
creatures that grow to large sizes. Usually those

2737
03:23:50,975 --> 03:23:54,617
fall into the realm of dragons and such. The color
blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue

2738
03:23:54,617 --> 03:24:03,426
dragon. However, the motion of this creature does
not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue

2739
03:24:03,426 --> 03:24:11,830
dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this 
is, but you do know it's probably something in the

2740
03:24:11,830 --> 03:24:14,318
serpentine-type magical realm.

2741
03:24:14,318 --> 03:24:17,229
TALIESIN: I heard them, I heard them describe it.
Would I know it from the description? Just from my

2742
03:24:17,229 --> 03:24:18,608
local knowledge?

2743
03:24:18,608 --> 03:24:20,118
MATT: Go ahead and make a history check.

2744
03:24:20,118 --> 03:24:22,616
MARISHA: The blue thing's weird. The blue thing is
what's throwing me.

2745
03:24:22,616 --> 03:24:23,599
TALIESIN: Nine.

2746
03:24:23,599 --> 03:24:28,711
MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, nothing of this type
has come across you. If it has, it's been too

2747
03:24:28,711 --> 03:24:32,838
long, and you've forgotten it. There are a number
of dangerous things that exist in these

2748
03:24:32,838 --> 03:24:33,767
mountains.

2749
03:24:33,767 --> 03:24:42,341
LAURA: I've got a really good idea. Wait. No!
Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it

2750
03:24:42,341 --> 03:24:43,869
as far as you can.

2751
03:24:43,869 --> 03:24:45,599
TRAVIS: I go over and I grab Scanlan--

2752
03:24:45,599 --> 03:24:47,073
SAM: No!

2753
03:24:47,073 --> 03:24:49,990
LAURA: A boulder or something.

2754
03:24:49,990 --> 03:24:55,620
TRAVIS: I put Scanlan down. Find a large rock
that's tumbled down, maybe.

2755
03:24:55,620 --> 03:24:58,643
MATT: Yeah, they're easy to find. There's like
some that are this big, some that are larger.

2756
03:24:58,643 --> 03:24:59,960
They're really heavy.

2757
03:24:59,960 --> 03:25:02,603
TRAVIS: And I discus the thing and (whoosh).

2758
03:25:02,603 --> 03:25:06,113
MATT: Make an athletics check.

2759
03:25:06,113 --> 03:25:09,199
TRAVIS: Well, that was great. 24.

2760
03:25:09,199 --> 03:25:20,233
MATT: (whoosh) You release the rock. (impact) It
skids to a halt. As it does, you can see suddenly

2761
03:25:20,233 --> 03:25:26,769
over the course (whoosh) something very quickly
move, and it's a head. It's a snout. You see it's

2762
03:25:26,769 --> 03:25:40,963
probably a good six, seven-foot wide. A giant,
lizard-like, toothy jaw. Blue scales against it

2763
03:25:40,963 --> 03:25:45,165
with large kind of horned ridges across the back
of its head. And its claws (clacking) on the edge.

2764
03:25:45,165 --> 03:25:49,373
Looks down. Looks down at the rest of you. Rears
back.

2765
03:25:49,373 --> 03:25:50,893
LAURA: It saw us?

2766
03:25:50,893 --> 03:25:53,632
LIAM: Didn't see me.

2767
03:25:53,632 --> 03:25:55,243
ORION: Well, of course it saw us.

2768
03:25:55,243 --> 03:25:57,172
LAURA: With 37 stealth, yo. It saw us?

2769
03:25:57,172 --> 03:25:59,755
MARISHA: But it didn't seem to give a shit?

2770
03:25:59,755 --> 03:26:02,516
MATT: It just withdrew over the edge.

2771
03:26:02,516 --> 03:26:03,899
SAM: Should we run?

2772
03:26:03,899 --> 03:26:05,828
LAURA: Maybe just move really fast away from him

2773
03:26:05,828 --> 03:26:09,795
MARISHA: I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us.
Then we can haul ass really fast.

2774
03:26:09,795 --> 03:26:11,367
SAM: Will it move with us, your shell?

2775
03:26:11,367 --> 03:26:14,252
MARISHA: Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It
moves with me.

2776
03:26:14,252 --> 03:26:16,888
LIAM: Yeah, fuck this thing. Let's get out of
here.

2777
03:26:16,888 --> 03:26:18,723
MARISHA: Okay! I cast Anti-Life Shell. Stay
close!

2778
03:26:18,723 --> 03:26:27,253
MATT: Okay. As you begin casting and finish the
spell. As the sphere appears-- at which point you

2779
03:26:27,253 --> 03:26:35,188
now see a large blue blur (whoosh) dart off of the
cliffside into the air (impact noise) and skidding

2780
03:26:35,188 --> 03:26:39,017
right in front of you guys, blocking off the side
of the ravine you guys were running towards. You

2781
03:26:39,017 --> 03:26:45,371
can now see it: a huge, elongated, serpentine body
covered in blue scales and horns. You can see what

2782
03:26:45,371 --> 03:26:53,705
looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs
all across its long, snakelike torso. As it looks

2783
03:26:53,705 --> 03:27:00,418
it snarls at you all (snarls). And you see sparks
of energy, electricity (sparking noises) in its

2784
03:27:00,418 --> 03:27:05,368
jaw. (growls, roars)

2785
03:27:05,368 --> 03:27:06,730
LIAM: Salamander?

2786
03:27:06,730 --> 03:27:08,642
MATT: And that's where we're going it end
tonight!

2787
03:27:08,642 --> 03:27:09,736
(yelling)

2788
03:27:09,736 --> 03:27:10,862
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!

2789
03:27:10,862 --> 03:27:11,842
SAM: You can't do that!

2790
03:27:11,842 --> 03:27:14,117
MATT: I can, because it's 10:30.

2791
03:27:14,117 --> 03:27:16,565
LIAM: No, it's not. It's like 8:45.

2792
03:27:16,565 --> 03:27:19,016
MATT: We can keep going if you guys want to stay
long. It's Thursday night.

2793
03:27:19,016 --> 03:27:25,356
ZAC: I'm coming to you with my laptop before you
continue.

2794
03:27:25,356 --> 03:27:27,209
LIAM: Who's that guy?

2795
03:27:27,209 --> 03:27:29,707
MATT: But to give you a little perspective, that
is what essentially you'd be facing.

2796
03:27:29,707 --> 03:27:32,213
(loud reactions)

2797
03:27:32,213 --> 03:27:35,259
LAURA: What the fuck? It's got so many arms.

2798
03:27:35,259 --> 03:27:38,418
LIAM: That's a kobold.

2799
03:27:38,418 --> 03:27:40,658
MATT: Yeah, totally. Kobold.

2800
03:27:40,658 --> 03:34:46,741
