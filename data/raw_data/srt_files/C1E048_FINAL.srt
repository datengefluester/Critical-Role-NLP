1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:03,971
MATT: Hello everybody! Welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,756
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and roll dice
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:08,844
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do.

4
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:12,570
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer. I am the Dungeon
Master of the show. Before we get started, let's

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,994
go ahead and run through our announcements for the
evening. First, I wanted to let you guys know that

6
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:23,619
tonight-- tomorrow, I'm sorry. Tomorrow is the
last day to preorder your Dagger Dagger Dagger

7
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:28,360
shirt. Is it also the last day to do the Strongjaw
Ale?

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,539
LAURA: It is!

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,473
MATT: Strongjaw Ale and Dagger Dagger Dagger
shirts.

10
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:32,576
TRAVIS: Also ale.

11
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,439
ASHLEY: I need them!

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,635
MATT: You do need them.

13
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,993
LAURA: You do. Actually, Ashley, I think I got
shirts for you.

14
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:40,233
MATT: Yeah, we've got some shirts held for you.

15
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,584
SAM: Extra large!

16
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,133
TALIESIN: But if you're not Ashley, you'd better
get yourself a shirt.

17
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:50,161
MATT: Yep. So you have until tomorrow to get
those, so go to the Geek and Sundry store to

18
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:57,411
preorder if you're interested. Yay! Next up, a
reminder, me and Marisha are flying out bright and

19
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:02,404
early tomorrow morning to Pittsburgh for Tekko!
We're going to be doing awesome panels on

20
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:07,214
voiceover and gaming and all points nerdy on the
Internet in between, as well as signings and

21
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:11,294
autographs and all that fun stuff. So if you're in
the area and you want to find a place that's warm,

22
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:16,323
we'll be there in the convention, so hopefully
we'll see you guys over the weekend.

23
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:21,598
MARISHA: And I went to college there, so I'm going
to be finding my old homies and getting drunk.

24
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:25,286
TALIESIN: Do you have a college sweater that just
says "college"? You could really use one.

25
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:30,334
MARISHA: I went to the performing arts school, and
we did make football t-shirts, because we thought

26
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:34,055
it was funny, as our performing arts shirts.

27
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:35,811
TALIESIN: That sounds like a performing arts
joke.

28
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:36,735
MARISHA: Yeah.

29
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:39,157
SAM: Fascinating.

30
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:40,295
MATT: Indeed.

31
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,658
MARISHA: Cool story, bro.

32
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:49,593
MATT: Next up, I get to announce, coming up as
part of a celebration for International Tabletop

33
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:56,251
Day and a sponsorship by Pathfinder and
Syrinscape, who have been fantastic in getting

34
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:01,242
this program for me in this game as well, we're
going to be doing an event called "Critical Role

35
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:09,719
One Shot" on April 18th, Monday, at 7 to 10 PM.
We're going to be taking over Ivan's No Survivors

36
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,962
slot that evening to run a Pathfinder one-shot
that I'll be running. However, Ivan will actually

37
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,693
be playing as a player in that one.

38
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:17,946
ALL: What?

39
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:26,803
MATT: I know! What, what? (gunshot) Mind blown.
Destroyed. Ivan will be playing. We also will have

40
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:33,078
guesting players of Taliesin and Marisha in that
game as well, and we have two special guests that

41
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:36,801
evening who will be playing with us: the
illustrious Ashly Burch will be joining us for the

42
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,423
evening, and the wonderfully talented Phil Lamarr
as well.

43
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,363
SAM: Wait, what? I didn't know that.

44
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,557
MATT: Yeah! So it's going to be a fun night
playing Pathfinder.

45
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:47,947
LAURA: When is that, again?

46
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:52,543
MATT: That is April 18th, Monday at 7 PM, Pacific
Time.

47
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:53,886
TRAVIS: Aren't taxes due that day?

48
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,877
MATT: When you're done with your taxes, this is a
great way to celebrate.

49
00:02:55,877 --> 00:03:01,314
MARISHA: A great way to celebrate. I'll be filing
an extension, like everybody else.

50
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:07,896
MATT: It'll be a fun event, we've got some cool
surprises set up for the story, and I'm excited

51
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:14,441
about it, so come and join us 7 PM Pacific,
Monday, April 18th for Critical Role One Shot.

52
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:23,282
Also, those of you out there who are members of
the Nerd Block, or are looking to be, this

53
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:30,531
upcoming, now live, Nerd Block that is going out
has a little surprise in there, a little artistic

54
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,402
surprise for fans of Critical Role.

55
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:33,785
SAM: Oh? What is it?

56
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,151
MATT: They'll have to see.

57
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,691
SAM: Oh, a tiny poop. I'm in.

58
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:39,943
LAURA: A teeny-tiny poop, just from Sam.

59
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:45,641
MATT: But yeah, those of you out there who want to
check it out, we have a fun little insert there in

60
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:53,290
the box. You get to see if you grab one, so check
it out and see if it's to your liking. Liam, did

61
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,457
you want to talk about--?

62
00:03:54,457 --> 00:04:01,405
LIAM: Oh, yeah, hey! You know my love for Wyrmwood
Gaming and their boxes. We have these beautiful

63
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:03,742
ones. Lift up a Wyrmwood box.

64
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,504
LAURA: Oh! Oh my goodness.

65
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,717
LIAM: They make great, beautiful boxes. They have
all kinds of woods to hold your dice in, and if

66
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:14,388
you use the code "critrole," you will get free
shipping. But also, today, I would like to let you

67
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:20,204
all know that Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter
for their Sentinel box. I'm sure I'm forgetting

68
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:25,715
the actual name, but it's a beautiful box. It's
good for D&amp;D, it's good for Magic: The Gathering,

69
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:30,045
and it holds cards, it holds dice, there's a
Bluetooth in it so that if you lose it, you can

70
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:30,934
find it.

71
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,238
TRAVIS: Satellites can see it?

72
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,466
LAURA: I wish we had the box in front of us, but
go look it up, it's got this box on the top, and

73
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,835
then it separates on the bottom and you can put
your dice in the bottom.

74
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:44,579
LIAM: It's called the Sentinel deck box. There's
also a version of it called the Vox Machina, which

75
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,979
is a premium item, and it's gorgeous.

76
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,362
TRAVIS: Premium, premium, premium.

77
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:55,739
LIAM: Premium. But tossing this out, too, if you
guys want any of the other Sentinel deck boxes and

78
00:04:55,739 --> 00:05:00,244
you want to get the logo etched onto it, that's
also an option. I don't know if it's on the site

79
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:01,549
or not, but it will be.

80
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,407
MARISHA: It's an off-the-menu item.

81
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,126
LAURA: Yeah. Check it out!

82
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,901
LIAM: 'Twill be there. Gorgeous box.

83
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,784
ASHLEY: That sounds like something Gilmore would
sell.

84
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:12,815
MATT: There you go. Oh, he would. Don't worry. He
would be happy to sell that.

85
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:16,132
SAM: And because of the Bluetooth feature, the NSA
will track your every roll.

86
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:20,554
MARISHA: You're now on the Homeland Security
list.

87
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:25,808
MATT: All right. Do we have anything else you guys
wanted to announce before we get started?

88
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:28,691
TRAVIS: That fucking Rogue One trailer! Holy
shit!

89
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,063
TALIESIN: I haven't seen it yet!

90
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,437
TRAVIS: All right. No words. No words. No words!

91
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:35,467
SAM: Is it like Batman vs. Superman good?

92
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,774
TALIESIN: Don't set expectations you can't match.

93
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:40,815
LAURA: Did you see it, Ashley?

94
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:44,089
ASHLEY: Yes! Gimme!

95
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,228
TRAVIS: Yeah. All the things.

96
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,484
MATT: I'm sure it's cool. I haven't seen it yet.

97
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,322
TRAVIS: Oh, on the break! On the break, on the
break.

98
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,742
LAURA: Yeah, we'll watch it on the break.

99
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:56,013
MATT: I haven't had a chance, I've been busy
working on this shit for you guys!

100
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,860
TRAVIS: What, you don't just make this stuff up as
you go?

101
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,945
MATT: (mock weeping) No, I have to prepare.

102
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,421
TALIESIN: It's imaginary, how could it be? You
just flow with it. Right?

103
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,857
MARISHA: Oh, I thought this was scripted.

104
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:07,558
LAURA: I've been in rehearsal all day for this.

105
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:10,564
SAM: Hey, Wyrmwood crashed.

106
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:13,637
LIAM: Wyrmwood crashed? Sorry, Wyrmwood. Or you're
welcome, Wyrmwood.

107
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:16,197
TALIESIN: I'm Instagramming my Wyrmwood box right
now, too.

108
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:18,270
TRAVIS: Well done. Well done, legion.

109
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,346
SAM: Colbert Nation.

110
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:29,008
LIAM: I should say, the etching is a new
development, so if that's not happening today,

111
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,354
it'll be there tomorrow-ish.

112
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,501
MARISHA: Yeah, so don't yell at them. Don't be
like, "Bullshit!"

113
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,703
TRAVIS: It's either going to be there tomorrow or
very soon.

114
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:39,471
LAURA: Because we literally got an email about it
as we were starting.

115
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,307
MATT: Cool. All right.

116
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,645
TRAVIS: Now we go to our deaths.

117
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:52,389
MATT: Now, we bring it back. I will ask if we
could turn that speaker down a little bit. A

118
00:06:52,389 --> 00:07:01,559
little bit more. That's good. Great. All right,
guys. Let's plug in to the world of Exandria, as

119
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:07,280
we begin tonight's episode of Critical Role. So,
last we left off, the adventuring party of Vox

120
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,971
Machina, traversing the lands in search of lost
artifacts of wars of old, referred to as the

121
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:22,895
Vestiges of Divergence, in hopes of eventually
tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic

122
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:27,453
dragons called the Chroma Conclave that have
destroyed society all across the continent of

123
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:34,603
Tal'Dorei and beyond, you returned to the
outskirts of a city named Westruun that was very

124
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:40,993
important in your early adventures, to find it,
from a distance, partially destroyed by the dragon

125
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:47,707
attack but a couple weeks before, and since taken
over by what seems to be the remnants, now

126
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:57,859
swelling in power and size, of Grog's old herd of
wandering barbarians and various savages. Having

127
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:04,332
taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron
hand, it was also deemed not the right time to

128
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:10,265
face this foe, and as such the party continued
venturing southward in the direction of the

129
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:17,996
Frostweald, where somewhere at the base of the
Stormpeak Mountains, the mate of Osysa, the

130
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:26,259
gynosphinx you had met in Vasselheim-- her mate
resides somewhere in this vicinity. That's all the

131
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:33,724
information you have to go on as you head down
towards the frozen forest. So. That's where we

132
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:42,944
begin. As you guys continue pushing south from
Westruun, seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke

133
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:49,662
that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as
the town itself vanishes over the horizon, you

134
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:56,876
continue to push southward through the open grass
fields. You continue traveling for the better part

135
00:08:56,876 --> 00:09:02,094
of a day, eventually coming up along the side of
the Silvercut Channel, which is the river that

136
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:11,123
comes down and cuts through near Kraghammer to the
west of Westruun. It goes past Kymal and then

137
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:18,903
eventually heads down in this direction, towards
the Foramere Basin. You guys, travelling fairly

138
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:22,709
quickly, as you're in your mist forms, which is
making up a lot of the normal travel time you

139
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:32,718
would have to worry about here, by the time the
sun finally begins to set across the mountains--

140
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,938
pay attention, please.

141
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,121
SAM: Yes!

142
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,473
MATT: Sorry.

143
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:39,593
LIAM: It's another beholder!

144
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:43,633
MATT: I've got plenty of things I could throw in
here if you guys aren't paying attention!

145
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,640
TALIESIN: That's not funny.

146
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,304
MATT: No, it's really funny for me. As you guys
continue pushing southward, as the sun slowly

147
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:57,653
begins to set in the distance, you glance over
towards the Foramere Basin. You can see, just over

148
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:06,670
to the right, the city of Kymal, which has lights
glimmering in the far distance. But what you see

149
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,371
by the basin itself is this large lake that is
centered in this region just north of the

150
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:18,017
Frostweald. You can see where the two main rivers
diverge before heading southward towards the

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:26,163
ocean. There's a smattering of various tents that
are clustered right towards the side of the

152
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:34,565
riverbank and the edge of the lake itself. As you
continue coasting overhead in your mist forms, you

153
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:39,428
see small trails of smoke from smoldering
campfires, clusters of people and families

154
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:45,846
wandering the shore in this small group. You
continue going forward?

155
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,514
SAM: I mean, we should check it out.

156
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,497
LAURA: Yeah.

157
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:50,859
MATT: You don't have to, you can keep going.

158
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,175
SAM: It's a tent city?

159
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:53,502
MATT: It looks like it, yeah.

160
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:54,964
LAURA: They're refugees, probably.

161
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:55,988
SAM: Hundreds, thousands?

162
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:04,354
MATT: There's probably a few dozen, close to maybe
50, 60.

163
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:10,021
MARISHA: What do the tents look like? Do they look
like military encampment tents, or refugee tents?

164
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:14,098
MATT: You can't really tell from this distance,
especially as the light is beginning to slowly

165
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,232
diminish.

166
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,534
TRAVIS: Can we float closer?

167
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,721
LAURA: We float down, we float down.

168
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,775
SAM: Oh, are we still mists?

169
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:19,661
LAURA: Yeah.

170
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:20,882
SAM: Oh my God.

171
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:23,555
TRAVIS: That whole description, and yes, we're
still mists.

172
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:32,723
MATT: As you coast down closer, you get a better
look, and yeah, there are about 50, 60 or so

173
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:37,626
people on the outside. You don't have an idea of
how many are inside the tents. Even more, most

174
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:48,802
likely. But these tents are fairly ramshackle,
barely standing, the people look destitute. They

175
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:53,906
look like they're holding onto survival here on
the outside of the city. You see a few boats that

176
00:11:53,906 --> 00:12:01,030
are going in and out on the shore, probably
fishermen. There are a few bonfires that are now

177
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,366
starting to kick up as the night's cold begins to
swell in. It looks like this is a fairly

178
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:11,772
"thriving," a fairly functional refugee camp.

179
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,520
TRAVIS: Well, those that give a fuck, speak up.

180
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,384
LAURA: We can't, we're in mist form.

181
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,504
TRAVIS: Then like (hissing) in a direction.

182
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,794
LAURA: (hissing) I think we should help them.
Maybe we can --

183
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:23,955
TALIESIN: (buzzing fart sound)

184
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,876
SAM: Good point.

185
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:29,791
LAURA: Maybe we can send them back to Whitestone.

186
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,013
TALIESIN: Maybe, if we could talk, which we can't
right now.

187
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:37,433
LAURA: I float down. Into the trees, outside of
the camp.

188
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:40,045
TALIESIN: I follow.

189
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:42,383
MATT: Okay. These are open grasslands, there
aren't a lot of trees, and they're spotted around.

190
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:46,752
There are a few rock formations and small hills,
you might be able to get out of sight.

191
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:47,790
LAURA: Around there.

192
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,486
MATT: So you coast around there and you go back
into your physical form. The rest of you follow?

193
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,946
TRAVIS: Tall grass? Low grass?

194
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:54,834
MATT: It's probably thigh-length.

195
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,210
LIAM: Following.

196
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,947
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go.

197
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,450
MATT: For you, close to the knee.

198
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,847
LAURA: Near the rocks, so that we're in
camouflage.

199
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:07,687
MATT: So you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the
outside of the nearest part of the camp,

200
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:12,824
reconstitute into your physical forms. At this
point, the sun has now disappeared over the

201
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:19,403
horizon and the blues have now gone to orange, to
purple, and you can see in the distance the

202
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:24,119
darkness of night is starting to crest over the
sky. What do you want to do?

203
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,320
TRAVIS: What are we stopped for? Are we here?

204
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,145
LAURA: No, it looks like a refugee camp, Grog.

205
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,929
TALIESIN: They may have information.

206
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,947
LAURA: People that escaped from Westruun,
potentially.

207
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,349
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

208
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:43,392
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, it's a large group of people,
I'm assuming they came from a city of some sort.

209
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:45,216
TRAVIS: Hey, Scanlan.

210
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,189
SAM: Oi.

211
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:50,469
TRAVIS: If we go over there and it gets a little
hairy, you've still got old magic door, right?

212
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,527
SAM: Old magic doll?

213
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,974
TRAVIS: Hugh Hefner house!

214
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,982
SAM: Oh, yeah, magic door. Yes.

215
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,627
TRAVIS: Magic doll if you have it, too, for later,
but yeah.

216
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:02,210
SAM: I mean, I have a little Pike figurine that I
keep with me.

217
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,070
TALIESIN: Oh.

218
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,950
SAM: What, no, it's a keepsake!

219
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,303
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it is.

220
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,303
SAM: Why is everything I say creepy?

221
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,776
LIAM: I don't know, why is it?

222
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:17,656
LAURA: Maybe we should pop them back to Whitestone. I
feel like it might be good, if we find out if

223
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,727
they're hurting. That's where we're putting our
survivors.

224
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,349
LIAM: They look like they're hurting.

225
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:24,924
MARISHA: I couldn't help with that today.

226
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:28,767
LAURA: Oh. We could rest overnight, and you could
pop them in in the morning?

227
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,102
MARISHA: What time is it?

228
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,280
LIAM: It's late. Sun's gone down.

229
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,770
TRAVIS: Super late. Yeah, and if they're from
Westruun--

230
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,493
LAURA: Are you out of all your-- oh, mist form.

231
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,071
MARISHA: Mist form got us here.

232
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:37,905
TALIESIN: It's worth talking to them at the very
least.

233
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:42,533
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pike and I are from Westruun. If
they're of that village, or that city, I'd like to

234
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,876
make sure they're all right.

235
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,152
MARISHA: Maybe they're friends.

236
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:48,019
LAURA: Maybe we'd find Pike's grandfather.

237
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,805
TRAVIS: Grandfather Wilhelm.

238
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,442
LAURA: Percy, would Whitestone be able to sustain
this many more people?

239
00:14:53,442 --> 00:15:00,468
TALIESIN: I think at some point we're going to
have to have that conversation, but for now I

240
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,957
think we'll probably be all right.

241
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:04,058
TRAVIS: Yeah!

242
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:05,131
LAURA: All right.

243
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,729
TRAVIS: You're good for it. You're rich.

244
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:08,065
TALIESIN: For now.

245
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:13,940
LIAM: Here's an idea. Scanlan, you said
that a lot of people can go into your house, yeah?

246
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,506
SAM: I can fit many people into my hole.

247
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,580
LIAM: Could you-- (laughs)

248
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,757
MARISHA: I wonder why everything he says is
creepy.

249
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:25,740
LIAM: Could you invite the folk in, and then they
live in your hole for a little while, and then

250
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,389
when we get to Whitestone, you open your hole and
out they come?

251
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,937
SAM: No, not quite.

252
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:32,857
MARISHA: That's some cartel shit right there.

253
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:37,979
TRAVIS: Yeah. We become "Vox Machina: Coyotes."

254
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:42,518
LIAM: Scanlan is the mule.

255
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:48,187
SAM: No, the house is mainly for us and a few
guests, for one night at a time.

256
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,654
LAURA: You can't, like, leave them there.

257
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,219
LIAM: Didn't you say 100 people, the other day?

258
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:56,795
SAM: 100 servants are in there. I don't quite-- I
haven't jammed people in there. I don't know how

259
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:58,429
many it can totally hold.

260
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,764
MARISHA: You mean, you've never thrown a party?

261
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,916
MATT: Go ahead and roll an intelligence check

262
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,404
SAM: First roll of the night: Natural 20!

263
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,172
(cheering)

264
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,216
SAM: Wasted it on an intelligence check.

265
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,193
(laughter)

266
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,277
TRAVIS: Smile upon us, dice gods!

267
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:16,549
MATT: Though the magic is new to you, you've spent
in your first time casting it and a large part of

268
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,808
the evening, especially since you realized you
weren't going to have as fun a night as you

269
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:24,151
thought, after the broom had been taken and Vex
left your room, learning the intricacies of the

270
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:29,840
spell itself and the pocket dimension that is
created. You can fit quite a few people in there.

271
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,399
However, it is stationary in its entrance and exit
and then once the spell comes to completion after

272
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,800
a 24-hour period, it expels anyone and anything
that was brought into it, on the spot where it was

273
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,154
originally cast.

274
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,058
LIAM: I see.

275
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:44,841
LAURA: Oh.

276
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,452
TRAVIS: Like gently, or like--

277
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:47,562
SAM: Like a flush.

278
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:49,540
TRAVIS: Like (sweetly) "Please leave." or like
(angry) "Get the fuck out!"

279
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,071
LIAM: Is that a yes or a no?

280
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:55,427
SAM: It's not a transporting-type spell. It is a
temporary shelter, at best.

281
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:57,264
LIAM: You just don't want to bring them in.

282
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:01,027
SAM: I have a cold, cold heart.

283
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:03,274
(laughter)

284
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:06,489
SAM: Listen, I'll consider taking the females in.

285
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,606
TRAVIS: That is very noble of you.

286
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:11,135
LAURA: So noble, Scanlan.

287
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,609
TRAVIS: I will join him in this charity.

288
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,942
LAURA: Oh, yes.

289
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:17,157
MARISHA: Well, all right, why don't we just walk
around and talk to these people? Maybe they're not

290
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:22,215
even interested in being transported. Let's just
find some citizens around.

291
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,816
LAURA: Should we make sure they're actually
innocent, nice people?

292
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:28,989
MARISHA: We should probably do that as well, not
like a band of thieves. Bandits.

293
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,022
LAURA: Stealth ahead.

294
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:30,950
TRAVIS: That could be fun.

295
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,314
LAURA: Can I sneak ahead and just listen to them?

296
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:35,001
SAM: Yes, sneaking up on them will definitely put
them on our side.

297
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,500
LAURA: Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to
hear what they're saying.

298
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,607
SAM: All right, all right.

299
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,598
LIAM: She can read lips so she doesn't even get
that close.

300
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,867
LAURA: It's pretty dark, though. But I do have
good darkvision.

301
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:49,834
MATT: This is true. As the night takes over, it's
still quite a distance to be able to make out a

302
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:53,030
lot of detail. You'd probably have to get closer.
But you're going alone?

303
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,547
TRAVIS: No, twins.

304
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,601
MATT: Twins going together?

305
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:56,304
LAURA: Yeah.

306
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:57,215
MATT: Why don't you both roll a stealth check?

307
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,798
LIAM: Oh, I guess I'm going then.

308
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,724
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye also, to see if
anything-- From a great distance, I'm just keeping

309
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:02,625
an eye out.

310
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,427
LAURA: We're in the woods, right?

311
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:07,307
MATT: No. You are in the plains.

312
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,521
SAM: There are no woods, tall grasses

313
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,186
LAURA: Just kidding, we're in the grasslands.

314
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,523
LIAM: Grass, grass. 32.

315
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,740
TRAVIS: I'll roll this big bastard.

316
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,090
TALIESIN: White manna, not green manna.

317
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,974
LAURA: 18.

318
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:15,912
MATT: All right.

319
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,123
SAM: I'm hiding in a tree.

320
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:19,031
MATT: There's no-- (annoyed hmm)

321
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:19,841
LAURA: There's no--

322
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:21,087
(laughter)

323
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:22,408
TRAVIS: "There's no (grumbles)"

324
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,199
SAM: The grass to me is like a tree

325
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:32,038
MATT: This is true, actually. It's more of a rose
bush. So as you guys push forward, pushing and

326
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:38,998
stalking through the grass, you come to about 40,
50 feet outside. And there's a little bit of

327
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:46,490
chatter, it's hard to make out at this distance
but the people seem to, not necessarily be jovial.

328
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,157
Almost like they've accepted the circumstances and
are just surviving it for the time being. There

329
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:59,090
are a few individuals that are armed, though the
armor itself seems patchwork, or you know, not the

330
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:05,440
best or most trained of individuals currently
guarding this group of survivors. But there are

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,634
patrols going around, people keeping a close look,
there are torches being lit now as people begin

332
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,676
walking--

333
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,643
LAURA: Do we see anyone that we recognize from
Westruun?

334
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,121
MATT: Not from this distance.

335
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:14,898
LAURA: No.

336
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:21,286
MATT: With your darkvision you can make out the
outline of the very, very nearest individuals, the

337
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,751
guards in particular. But at this distance, nobody
catches your eye that you'd be able to make out

338
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,720
much detail on, that you would recognize.

339
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,896
LIAM: Can we just sit for five or ten minutes?

340
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,382
LAURA: Well, the guards are coming through with
torches, I don't want them to find us and think

341
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:33,628
we're spies.

342
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:34,973
LIAM: But we are.

343
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,716
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't want them to think that.

344
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:37,833
LIAM: But we are.

345
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:42,963
LAURA: Yeah. I think you can stay 'cause you're
more hidden than I am. I'm going to go back to the

346
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,175
group.

347
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,301
LIAM: All right.

348
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:46,460
LAURA: I feel like they're going to see me.

349
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,259
LIAM: All right.

350
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,463
MATT: (chuckling) You don't know that. As far as
you know, you're so hidden.

351
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:51,222
LAURA: "I'm so hidden." Shit.

352
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,355
TRAVIS: Come on.

353
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:54,435
LAURA: All right, all right, all right. Just a
second.

354
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,832
LIAM: I'm just going to stay here for a couple of
minutes longer. Wait, you said they were coming

355
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,164
our direction or they're just-- ?

356
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,446
MATT: No, they're just wandering. Just patrolling

357
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,454
LAURA: Oh all right.

358
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:01,367
LIAM: You're paranoid!

359
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,376
LAURA: Okay, fine fine fine fine.

360
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:03,441
LIAM: Let me listen for a bit.

361
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:08,629
MATT: Okay. I'll have you both roll perception
checks, if you could.

362
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,287
LIAM: All right. 22.

363
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,604
LAURA: 23.

364
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:17,790
MATT: Okay. You two, at about the same time, focus
best you can. You have to scoot a little bit

365
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,764
closer once the guard that's nearest to you passes
by. You wait for your moment, scoot up close, get

366
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:28,489
by one of the tents, and look off to the side.
There are a few folks that catch your attention a

367
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:33,743
little bit. There's one that was Elowen
Brist, who was the mother of the first child that

368
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:37,722
went missing in Westruun. You see her, with her
daughter who's a little bit older now that you

369
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,203
guys helped save her.

370
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:40,492
MARISHA: Oh my god.

371
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:42,692
LIAM: All these throwbacks are blowing my mind.

372
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:48,437
MATT: A little dirty but alive. They wander off.
You scan through the crowd, keeping an eye out for

373
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:55,551
the guard as well. No one really catches your
attention. You see one older gentleman that walks

374
00:20:55,551 --> 00:21:05,506
by, 60s, not completely withered away. But, you
know, older but carries himself with much

375
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:11,909
importance. Very expensive clothing, reds and
blues. It seems like he's attempting to hold a

376
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:17,235
social station, even though in his current
location, society has crumbled. He doesn't really

377
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:21,349
catch your attention as anyone you recognize, but
the person to the left of him is a very

378
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:27,214
familiar-looking elven man, with long brown hair
slicked over and behind his ears. This is Drez

379
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:30,620
Vina, who originally contacted you when you
arrived in Westruun.

380
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,966
LAURA: Holy-- (whispers) That's Drez Vina!

381
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,295
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,836
MATT: He's looking a little rough, too. This has
not been the kindest time to any of these people.

383
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:42,545
LAURA: Well, should we go back to the group or tell
them to come on in?

384
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:45,287
LIAM: Do we have to go back to tell them to come
on in?

385
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:46,505
LAURA: We have earrings.

386
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,102
LIAM: Well, yeah, that's true

387
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,043
LAURA: (whispering) Hey, you guys.

388
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:50,960
TRAVIS: What?

389
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,056
SAM: What, what what what what?

390
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,118
LAURA: You guys! Hey Percy, pay attention.

391
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,057
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yes. Hello. What?

392
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:59,011
LAURA: Hey, guess who I'm looking at right now?

393
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,334
TALIESIN: Your brother.

394
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,212
LAURA: Well--

395
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:02,865
SAM: God, you're so good at that.

396
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,545
LAURA: Drez fucking Vina

397
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:05,550
MARISHA: (gasps) Drez!

398
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,258
SAM: Wait, remind us, who-- ?

399
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:11,638
LAURA: Drez Vina was that dude that sent us on our
very first mission together, you guys.

400
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,280
TALIESIN: Ooh.

401
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,894
MARISHA: Yeah! He protected us, he's a magic
user.

402
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:16,226
SAM: Oh. I was mostly drunk that time.

403
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:17,693
LAURA: Yeah, Percy you weren't there yet.

404
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:19,398
TALIESIN: Oh, at the Winter's Crest festival, I
remember.

405
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:21,390
MATT: (laughing) That's not him at all.

406
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,605
LIAM: No. He was-- Drez Vina.

407
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,778
TRAVIS: "That's not it at all." (chuckles)

408
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:24,905
LAURA: Percy, you weren't there--

409
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:26,028
MATT: That's Abjurist Noja.

410
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,206
MARISHA and TALIESIN (in unison): Oh. Abjurist
Noja.

411
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,401
LIAM: Drez Vina was the dick. Drez Vina's a dick.

412
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,312
LAURA: Drez Vina's the guy. Drez Vina was the
asshole.

413
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:30,482
SAM: Doesn't he work for someone else?

414
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,768
MATT: He had a Master.

415
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,752
MARISHA: Wait, was he the guy that we stole from,
kind of?

416
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,432
LAURA: Hey, keep it down. I don't know
who all can hear over these earrings!

417
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,234
TRAVIS: Oh, did he have the tower with the magical
items?

418
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,807
MATT: Here, I should step in here and clarify--

419
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,478
(laughter)

420
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,766
MARISHA: It's been like three years.

421
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,082
LIAM: This was only three years ago.

422
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:47,383
MATT: No, I know. Drez Vina came to you under the
pretense that he was working for an individual

423
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:51,733
called the Master, he called him his Master, who
was interested in hiring your services. Originally

424
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:57,754
sent you into the mage tower of Eskil Ryndarien,
the Realmseer, to steal the brass box with the

425
00:22:57,754 --> 00:23:01,078
pearl top. However, you did not steal it and
instead you ended up befriending the Archmage.

426
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,975
TRAVIS: He let us pick something.

427
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:05,999
MATT: Yes, he let you pick something from his
array of items.

428
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:06,990
SAM: That's right!

429
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,926
MATT: Drez then found you guys at your inn, a
number of weeks later. And Drez was very unhappy

430
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:18,011
that you both didn't return with the item,
and used a very powerful and expensive object that

431
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:23,969
was part of this endeavor, and never paid it back.
So, to pay back your debt, he sent you guys to the

432
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:30,948
Druid Barrow where you had to retrieve this
cortex, this magical gem that was embedded in the

433
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:32,023
center of--

434
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,473
MARISHA: And that was where we fought the golem!

435
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:38,955
MATT: Yep. Where you fought the golem. And
you retrieved the cortex successfully, and that's

436
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,486
the last you've seen of him.

437
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,742
LAURA: See? He likes us now! We totally helped
him.

438
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:45,340
SAM: But he has magical items--

439
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,687
LAURA: Well, maybe not anymore.

440
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,272
SAM: Had. Well, we should--

441
00:23:49,272 --> 00:23:54,441
LIAM: What was, DM, can you remind me the name of
the mother that we spoke to all that time ago?

442
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,974
LAURA: The one you just mentioned.

443
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:56,938
MATT: Elowen.

444
00:23:56,938 --> 00:24:00,525
LIAM: Elowen? Elowen. I'd rather go talk to her.

445
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:05,759
MATT: I'm pretty sure, let me check my notes.
Yeah, Elowen. Elowen Brist.

446
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,038
LAURA: Do you guys want to just come on in?

447
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,363
SAM: Yes, let's go in.

448
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,563
TALIESIN: I don't see what the harm is.

449
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,432
TRAVIS: We go in.

450
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:12,922
LAURA: Make a nice, pleasant chattering-- maybe
you should sing, Scanlan, as you

451
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:14,455
approach so that people know we're nice

452
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:27,088
SAM: I would love to sing. Oh. Right now?
(singing) Sunny days, chasing the dragons away, On

453
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:39,415
our way to where the air is clean, Can you tell me
how to kill, How to kill some drag-eens?

454
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:41,467
MATT: Go ahead and roll a performance check.

455
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,768
SAM: Performance check.

456
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:44,702
MATT: Yes.

457
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:47,375
LAURA: What is it? What is it?

458
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:54,873
SAM: It fell off the table. And it is-- a six. But
plus 13.

459
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:55,755
MATT: Okay.

460
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,019
SAM: Wait-- plus 14.

461
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:07,910
MATT: Plus 14? Okay. Okay, so, as you guys begin
strolling up, immediately you see torches (fire sounds).

462
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,550
LIAM: Hands up. No weapons.

463
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,519
MATT: You see guards come forward, two of them
with nocked crossbows. "Who goes there?

464
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,256
LAURA: Hey, you guys!

465
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:20,394
MATT: And they don't really recognize-- they're
all looking at this source of singing.

466
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,554
Crossbows--

467
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:27,924
SAM: (singing) It's a magic carpet ride. Except we
burned our magic carpet so we can't--

468
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:30,941
(laughter)

469
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:34,861
MATT: The guards slowly drop their crossbows.
"What's your business?"

470
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:38,664
TRAVIS: Hey, hey, that's not necessary. We're
friends.

471
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:41,912
MATT: "We've already got enough mouths to feed.
Move along."

472
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:47,626
TRAVIS: No, we're not looking for food. We're here
to provide aid if we can, if it's in need, if people

473
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:49,179
need our help.

474
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,451
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

475
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:51,505
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

476
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:52,993
SAM: Persuasion? You?

477
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:54,090
LAURA: Grog--

478
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,873
TRAVIS: Ten.

479
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:01,936
MATT: While their crossbows are notched, they
haven't lowered them completely, they're still on

480
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,075
guard and still nervous of your approach.

481
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:12,403
LIAM: We also think there's a woman with you
named Elowen. She knows us. We'd like to speak to

482
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,862
her. We'll wait here.

483
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:18,933
MATT: One of them glances over at the other one.
One of the guards who was paying attention walks

484
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:22,564
away and they all raise their crossbows again and
just train them on you guys for the next few

485
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:23,465
minutes.

486
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,916
TRAVIS: I mean, it's really not necessary. Even if
you were to loose those, it would just be a

487
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:30,401
tickle. I mean, trust me, we come from Westruun,
all right?

488
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,393
LAURA: Don't you remember us? In Westruun?

489
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:34,021
TRAVIS: Yeah. Winter's Crest festival?

490
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:35,225
LAURA: Vox Machina?

491
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,390
TRAVIS: Grog?

492
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,327
Pike? Wilhelm?

493
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:42,356
MATT: One of the guards takes a moment and gives
you an eye and just goes--

494
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:50,291
"I remember seeing you around town. You
were-- Oh man, jeez, it's good to see you."

495
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:54,411
TRAVIS: Right? I'm as psyched about all this--

496
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:58,391
MATT: "Sorry if I gave you any trouble back in the
day. I was young and stupid."

497
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,877
SAM: Why don't you all lower your crossbows, for a
second?

498
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:11,652
MATT: "I mean no offense, but we're very guarded
with your kind at the moment."

499
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:19,043
TRAVIS: (inhales) Right. Yeah, yeah,
understandable. Right. We just actually came from

500
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:22,085
Westruun. It seems to be a bit occupied at the
moment.

501
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:25,763
MARISHA: And he's with us. So-- He's not with
them.

502
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:27,999
LAURA. He's different than the other guys, see? He's got
a beard.

503
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,945
TRAVIS: No, I, listen. It came about my own. I
just got the genetics for it.

504
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,522
(stage-whispers) Would you shut up?

505
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:39,494
MATT: At which point the guard that had
left comes back with Elowen. She walks up with her

506
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:44,709
tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of
grey on the sides, that probably has come since the

507
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,679
last time you've seen her and the experience of
having her child gone so long. It's taken a

508
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,998
physical toll on her. But there is a smile on her
face. Now she looks over and focuses her eyes--

509
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:54,353
LIAM: Elowen!

510
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:58,521
MATT: "That's them! That's them! Let them in, let
them in." And she runs forward immediately and

511
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,859
gives a big hug to you, Vex.

512
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:01,786
LAURA: Oh.

513
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:05,665
MATT: And starts moving through, and, you know,
just this big smile and surprise. And you can see

514
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,598
her little boy Simon come up to the side.

515
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,573
ALL: Oh! Simon!

516
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:15,370
MATT: Simon, who last time you saw, you were
retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the

517
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:24,174
Dread Emperor had called his domain. At which
point, there's a few quick pleasantries, as she

518
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:32,638
says hello again. She says: "Please, please come
in. Please. It's fine. They're trustworthy." And

519
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:37,704
the guards nod. And they follow behind, not in an
aggressive way but just in a being-careful kind of

520
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:43,667
way. So you have two people, two armed individuals
flanking you the entire walk that you guys are

521
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,492
doing, but it's at ease.

522
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:48,251
MARISHA: Keyleth goes up to Simon.

523
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:51,415
MATT: "Hi!"

524
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,325
MARISHA: How old are you now?

525
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:56,059
MATT: "This many-- " He puts up nine fingers.

526
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,575
MARISHA: You've grown up so well.

527
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:03,282
MATT: "Thank you."

528
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:06,886
MARISHA: And I just give him a big hug.

529
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:12,115
MATT: He freezes up. He's gotten a little shy at the
interaction.

530
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:18,327
LIAM: I kneel down next to him and I say: do you
want to see something cool? Look at this. And I

531
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:20,795
take off the serpent belt. And-- (snake hisses)

532
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,334
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

533
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:25,666
LIAM: And I put him around my neck. I named him
after you.

534
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,521
(laughter)

535
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:28,494
MATT: "Really?"

536
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:33,064
LIAM: He's my pet. Do you want to, he's gentle as
a lamb. Do you want to tickle his neck?

537
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,270
MATT: "Yes."

538
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,853
(laughter)

539
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:42,564
LIAM: Yeah. Here, you hold him. I set it down
around his neck. Don't worry. Nothing's going to

540
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:43,964
happen. It's fine.

541
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:46,722
MATT: He locks up again. Snakes and women have the
same reaction to this poor little boy.

542
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:49,525
LIAM: Simon, fart in his ear. Go ahead and fart in
his ear.

543
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:53,213
MATT: He gives you a stern look. And the snake
just wraps around him for a second.

544
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:56,093
MARISHA: Keyleth does a little wind gust and goes
(poof).

545
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:59,926
MATT: He goes (giggles) and starts laughing.
Reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle.

546
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:06,908
LIAM: It's good to see you again, kiddo. Come
here, Simon Jr. I'll put him back, now.

547
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:10,091
MATT: He has a big smile on his face now. "That's
so cool."

548
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:17,535
LAURA: While that was happening, I pulled
aside his mother. Is this everyone that made it

549
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,688
out of Westruun?

550
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:27,741
MATT: (sighs) "Well, we're one group. Many went to
Kymal, but they're at capacity now, and based on

551
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:35,330
"many of the farming fields that were destroyed or
burned by the dragon ransacking, there's only so

552
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,221
"much food to go around, so they had to turn us
away. But there were some small farming

553
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:46,246
"communities along the river that were kind enough
to take us in and we're... we're getting by."

554
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:48,734
LAURA: But you're searching for a home?

555
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:58,107
MATT: "Hoping to find out if anything takes care
of the problems in Westruun. You should probably

556
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:02,037
"talk to Cornelius. I don't know the details of
everything happening."

557
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:06,714
LAURA: Cornelius. Is he the man I saw in the finer
robes?

558
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:13,831
MATT: "No, no. Cornelius is rather-- he's not very
well-dressed. He--" And she scratches her head.

559
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:24,558
"He used to be the bookbinder in Westruun but when
everything fell apart, he rose up and took the

560
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,742
"lead in keeping everyone safe and so, I mean, he
won't say it, but we kind of look to him as a

561
00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:31,307
"leader for now."

562
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,598
LAURA: Did he work in the Cobalt Reserve?

563
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:36,140
MATT: "I think he did business with them, but I
don't think he worked directly with."

564
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,464
LAURA: Oh, okay.

565
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,482
MATT: "Here. Let me take you."

566
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,469
LAURA: Oh, wonderful.

567
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:44,394
MATT: She walks over and, as you guys are
talking to Simon, she scoops Simon up and pulls him

568
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:49,398
to her side and gives you guys a smile of
acknowledgement. "Come," and leads you guys--

569
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:50,724
LAURA: We're meeting Cornelius.

570
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:51,801
SAM: Okay.

571
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,691
TRAVIS: (softly) Who's Cornelius?

572
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,028
LAURA: He's a bookbinder.

573
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:56,223
TRAVIS: Never heard of him.

574
00:31:56,223 --> 00:32:01,416
MATT: You guys are led through. Most of the folks
stop what they're doing and pay attention. Some

575
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:07,014
look wary and guarded. Others, you see their faces
brighten up as they begin to connect the dots

576
00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:11,975
between the whispers they've heard of Vox Machina
throughout the landscape and the individuals

577
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:19,580
walking through. Most everyone seems to have a
somewhat visceral emotional reaction once Grog passes by. It

578
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:27,266
does catch you. You know, as a person who has
always stuck out against the society as it was,

579
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:32,501
and you've worked hard to a degree to get some
respect, especially in that city. Having so many

580
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:39,568
eyes on you, and you can feel the, while unearned
from your standpoint, the heaps of hatred that are

581
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:48,080
thrust upon you by how you look right now is
uncomfortable. Eventually, the guards and Elowen

582
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,813
bring you guys up to a central tent around what
looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a

583
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:57,718
lot of people are starting to bring their big nets
of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set

584
00:32:57,718 --> 00:33:04,340
up small cooking arrangements so that people for
the evening can have their dinner. She walks up to

585
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:10,076
the edge of tent, speaks to one of the guards,
mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to

586
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:15,597
Cornelius. The guard leans in, shouts off to the
side, "Cornelius, you've got some visitors. Is

587
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:24,220
"that okay?" A voice muffles through, "That's fine.
Go ahead and let them in." The guard pulls open

588
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,786
the tent, and at this point Elowen says, "I'm
going to go get my son some food. If you need

589
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:32,570
"anything, just ask around."

590
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,773
LIAM: We'll see you again.

591
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:43,158
MATT: "Thank you guys, again." She rubs Simon's
head and walks off. And as she walks off with him, he keeps

592
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:50,624
looking over his shoulder at you the whole time,
with a big smile on his face. You guys walk into

593
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:57,544
the tent, and it smells like a tent that's been
lived in for a couple weeks. The interior's not

594
00:33:57,544 --> 00:34:02,752
fancy by any means. It's blankets and burlap, and
whatever functions to guard against the relatively

595
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:07,014
muddy shores of the river. And you get a sense
that most places here, just because of the

596
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:12,590
landscape and how close it is to the river, mud is
tracked everywhere. So it's mostly caked ground.

597
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:19,667
There is a small cot on the far edge and there is
a table set up and some elements of dried fish

598
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:24,462
that are just being pulled from a sack on the
side. And there are two guards, and you can see

599
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:31,528
what appears to be Cornelius coming to greet you,
as you enter. A man in his mid-40's, blondish hair

600
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:40,717
with a scruffy, unkempt beard. You get the sense
that he's a working man. His hands look calloused.

601
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:50,402
He's got a layer of just dirt and grime across his
brow that tells you he's definitely one who gets

602
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:55,407
in the thick of it when it's needed. And you can
see why in this circumstance people put trust into

603
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:59,822
a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos
from simple means and prove themselves to want to

604
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:04,162
help everybody. And in the moment he smiles, you
immediately see also why people follow him. He's

605
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:09,088
got this bright, toothy, white smile, and he puts
his hand out immediately to each of you. "Pleasure

606
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:10,907
"to meet you. I'm Cornelius."

607
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,408
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

608
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:16,982
MATT: "So, I'm told that you all are here to talk
to me? What's this about?"

609
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:26,375
SAM: We know that you've been driven out of your
homes by an attack of dragon or dragons. How many

610
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,583
have menaced your city?

611
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:34,011
MATT: "Well, counts all say that we have upwards
of three dragons that came through here and tore

612
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:40,582
"into this city and-- They were gone for a while,
and we'd hoped they weren't going to return, but

613
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:47,623
"that's when--" He kinda looks over to you, Grog.
"That's when the savages came in and took what was

614
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:52,434
"left. And I mean no offense to that. I recognize
you; I've seen you around the town before. You

615
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:56,350
"seem like you're not like your ilk."

616
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,986
TRAVIS: No. No, I'm sorry, I don't know who you
are.

617
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:03,583
MATT: "That's okay. No one really knows who I am
and I want to keep it that way, when all this

618
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,000
"blows over."

619
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,332
TRAVIS: Understandable.

620
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,069
MATT: "Don't like all the attention."

621
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,480
TALIESIN: How long have you been nomadic for?

622
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,252
MATT: "We're going into our second week now, I
think. We sent a few of our most able-bodied up

623
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:23,787
"north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city
was safe to return to, and, well, only a few made

624
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:27,195
"it back, and those that did said it was a
bloodbath."

625
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:29,500
LAURA: It's quite dangerous there right now.

626
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,774
MATT: "Yeah."

627
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,821
TRAVIS: How many do you have here, in your
encampment with you?

628
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:39,313
MATT: "Let's see." He kind of takes a moment to
think and does couple marks on the dirt in front

629
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:44,171
of him to do a count. You can see he's not a very
numbers-guided person.

630
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:45,334
TRAVIS: I like him.

631
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,531
(laughter)

632
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:55,400
MATT: "I'd say we got probably about close to 60,
70 people left. We used to have more. Then we lost

633
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:02,017
"the scouting parties up north and, well, these
past four days we've had a few of these orcish

634
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:07,498
"fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp
every night and taking goods, people--"

635
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:11,175
MARISHA: What's your current destination?

636
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:15,440
MATT: "Hah, we got none. We're just staying here
and staying alive."

637
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,285
MARISHA: And what made you camp out here?

638
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:22,529
MATT: "Fish, mainly. I mean, all the farming
grounds are destroyed or they're being guarded

639
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:27,740
"currently, and there's no space for us in Kymal.
We can keep going east, but--"

640
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:36,182
TRAVIS: If I could be selfish for a moment. Have
you seen Wilhand? Pike, Pike Trickfoot. Her

641
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,354
grandfather.

642
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:39,507
LAURA: A small, older gnome?

643
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:44,101
MATT: "We got a few older gnomes from the city. I
don't think we have any among us though, no."

644
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:47,414
TRAVIS: Fine. Thought I'd ask.

645
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:54,696
LIAM: If we could help you relocate quite a ways
away, would you be open to that?

646
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:59,360
MATT: "How do you mean?"

647
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,961
LAURA: There's a city. A lot of the refugees from
other cities that have been destroyed by the

648
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:08,745
dragons are finding their way there and--

649
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,919
MARISHA: Percy actually has family who's in charge
there.

650
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,883
LAURA: We could give you safe passage.

651
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:15,952
TALIESIN: Possibly find you someplace to work.

652
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:17,983
LAURA: Very quick, safe passage.

653
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:22,517
MARISHA: Can they account for 70 extra people in
Whitestone?

654
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,362
TALIESIN: We lost a lot during the attack with the
Briarwoods.

655
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:27,282
MARISHA: Right.

656
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:30,253
TALIESIN: There's room, but there's only-- We can
maybe make room for a few more.

657
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:33,178
LAURA: There's farmland, there are some empty
buildings.

658
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,188
MATT: "I appreciate the offer, and--"

659
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,978
MARISHA: It hasn't been touched by dragons yet.

660
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,563
MATT: "Hah. 'Yet.'"

661
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:39,806
MARISHA: Yet.

662
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:45,717
MATT: "I tell you what. We greatly appreciate the
offer, and we're liable to take you up on that at

663
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:49,136
"some point in the near future. But right now, we
have too many of our people that are unaccounted

664
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:54,996
"for to the south. We got a couple scouting groups
who're trying to find out where these orcs are,

665
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:59,208
"where they've taken them. See if we can retrieve
our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live."

666
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,506
SAM: How many are missing right now?

667
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:08,659
MATT: "Well, we lost 11 in the last few nights of
exchange, to blade, and we've lost about nine to

668
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:14,131
"the actual bands themselves, so. There's nine
unaccounted for. We're hoping--"

669
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:19,509
SAM: If we found them, would you be more likely to
take your people to somewhere safe?

670
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:24,620
MARISHA: And what is necessarily stopping you from
at least sending a handful of women and children

671
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,503
ahead? Families that don't need to be nomadic.

672
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:32,604
MATT: "Do you have the means to keep them safe for
that kind of travel? That's a long way, up to

673
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,038
"Whitestone. We don't have the guards to keep them
up on that."

674
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,218
LAURA: We have very safe means of travel.

675
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,469
TALIESIN: A shortcut, one would say.

676
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:40,267
MARISHA: They'd be there in an instant.

677
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:47,707
MATT: "I don't know anything about any of that
weird magic stuff, but you seem like a reliable group."

678
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:52,134
LIAM: You can tell we're a motley bunch of
assholes. We've seen shit and we've done shit and

679
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,530
we can do shit.

680
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,536
MATT: "Ain't that the truth. Well--"

681
00:39:56,536 --> 00:40:01,838
TALIESIN: We'd also like to talk to you, perhaps,
to see if you've seen some shit. We're actually

682
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,973
looking for something out here.

683
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:06,535
LAURA: Oh.

684
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:07,675
LIAM: Are we?

685
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:14,541
TALIESIN: We are. Well, you've been travelling,
we're looking for a creature who may have what we

686
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,372
need to help defeat these dragons.

687
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,423
LAURA: Possibly a bit deeper into the Frostweald.

688
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:20,108
MATT: "Into the Frostweald?"

689
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:21,182
TALIESIN: Yes.

690
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,994
MATT: "That's where we're thinking our scouts are
saying these orcs are holed up, anyway."

691
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:26,260
LAURA: Really?

692
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,544
TALIESIN: That's useful.

693
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:32,028
MATT: "At least, that's where we've been sending
our folk. And follow them out there. Only one

694
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:34,315
"group went in after them and they never came back,
so--"

695
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,956
MARISHA: No one's returned who's come back?

696
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:38,701
MATT: "Oh, we've gotten one group that came back.
That's how we know they're there. But they were

697
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,080
"just a scouting party. They got to the outskirts
and came back."

698
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,336
MARISHA: Can we speak to them?

699
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:46,914
MATT: "I think they're out right now, actually.
Going to get more information. Sorry."

700
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:52,402
TALIESIN: Well, that works out well, then. We can
go up that direction, perhaps take care of this

701
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:53,519
problem, possibly.

702
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,521
LAURA: Yes.

703
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:55,747
TALIESIN: It's on the way.

704
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,786
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind a good stretch.

705
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:59,455
LAURA: Kill some orc.

706
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,601
TALIESIN: I could use some breathing.

707
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,842
MARISHA: Do you know your way around the
Frostweald at all?

708
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:10,805
MATT: "Can't say I do. But I do have some stake in
this personally, if you don't mind me asking. We

709
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:18,819
"don't have much to offer you, at all, really,
other than my gratitude. Tell of a few friends of

710
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:26,314
"ours that've found their way wherever these savage
creatures are stationed. One of the individuals

711
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:32,733
"that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my
brother, Cyrus. Don't know if he's still amongst

712
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:38,068
"the living, but if you are indeed planning on
taking a look at where these orcs are and bring

713
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:41,338
"folks back safe, if you could just keep an eye out
for him?"

714
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,961
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you, in times like these, it
will feel good to be able to do a bit of good.

715
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,163
TALIESIN: Hear, hear.

716
00:41:48,163 --> 00:41:50,192
LAURA: What does your brother look like?

717
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:56,848
MATT: "He's about 15 years younger than me. Shaggy
brown hair, bit of a puffy goatee. He looks like a

718
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:03,896
"lazy man. He is a lazy man, but I love him. If
you're looking for someone who's hiding in the

719
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,827
"corner, shaking in their boots, it's probably
him."

720
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,043
LAURA: Understood.

721
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:08,113
TRAVIS: Check the corners.

722
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:09,382
MATT: "It's his defense mechanism."

723
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:11,182
LAURA: (laughs) A very safe one.

724
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:15,715
MATT: "I hope." His eyes go a little colder at
that moment. "I hope."

725
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:21,046
LAURA: Well, we've been to the Frostweald before.
I'm not afraid to go in there again.

726
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,058
MARISHA: No.

727
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:25,029
TALIESIN: I say we take the evening to rest, and
first thing in the morning, head out.

728
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:31,542
LAURA: Would there be any injured members of your
camp that would want to head out in the morning to

729
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,115
Whitestone? Somebody that needs any medical
attention?

730
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:37,335
MATT: "We've got plenty of folks who aren't
feeling too well. Illness and disease,

731
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:42,528
"unfortunately, tend to go hand-in-hand with these
type of nomadic lifestyles. We can probably--

732
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:49,096
"about seven or eight people that could use some
relatively immediate attention. Couple survivors

733
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:57,376
"of the recent raids. If you can indeed do this,
you might be saving some lives, here."

734
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:00,197
MARISHA: Are we camping the rest of the night?

735
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:01,372
TALIESIN: Yes.

736
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:02,365
LIAM: That's wise.

737
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:05,016
TRAVIS: Yeah, we promise you no one will bother
you tonight.

738
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:15,433
MARISHA: Question. Question. Can I do my Transport
via Plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot

739
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:16,318
level?

740
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:17,561
MATT: Nope.

741
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,614
MARISHA: That's what I thought.

742
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:19,961
MATT: It would say it next to the spell. Ritual.

743
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:26,173
MARISHA: That's what I thought. Okay. Keyleth
spends the rest of the evening burning up my

744
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,427
remainder spell slots to do curing on those who
need it.

745
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:37,652
MATT: Okay. You guys are given a relatively
ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the

746
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:43,219
evening, cooked fish-- that's about all they have
to offer-- with a few leftover potatoes that

747
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:51,333
appear to have been recently either located
amongst their remaining crates, you have no idea,

748
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:56,702
but a passable meal is presented if you'd like,
and a place that has cloth over your head.

749
00:43:56,702 --> 00:44:01,574
TRAVIS: No, I don't need to sleep tonight. I'll be
on the watch.

750
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:02,774
SAM: Boy.

751
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,559
(laughter)

752
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,220
LAURA: Should we scour the camp for her
grandfather?

753
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,344
TALIESIN: I'm sleeping tonight. I don't know
what's wrong with him.

754
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:12,411
LAURA: I know he said there were no gnomes, but--

755
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,901
TRAVIS: There's only 60 people. I feel like he'd
know with 60.

756
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,992
LAURA: Yeah.

757
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:18,535
TRAVIS: That's like this many, like--

758
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:22,354
LIAM: And it's not a lot of gnomes. I'm assuming
it's a handful of gnomes.

759
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:23,262
TRAVIS: Yeah.

760
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:28,119
LAURA: Right. I just, I don't know. I wish Pike
were here.

761
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,026
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

762
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:31,618
LIAM: Always wish Pike was here.

763
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:40,333
MATT: You do recall, last time you were in
Whitestone, you left the other half of your

764
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,130
gatestone with Pike.

765
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,657
TALIESIN: I'll write a letter.

766
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:45,000
MARISHA: We'll write a letter.

767
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,945
TALIESIN: I'll write a letter that will travel
with them to Whitestone and--

768
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:49,525
SAM: Oh.

769
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:50,731
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea.

770
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,114
LAURA: That's wonderful, and she can pop over.

771
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:53,321
TALIESIN: Mm-hm. Take about a minute.

772
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:54,217
TRAVIS: Really?

773
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:55,048
MARISHA: Yeah.

774
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:56,314
SAM: Wait, we'd have to send them tonight,
though.

775
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:57,456
TALIESIN: No, in the morning.

776
00:44:57,456 --> 00:44:59,430
LAURA: They could go in the morning and just go
find her immediately.

777
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,925
MARISHA: Yeah, could task someone to find her
immediately and then, as soon as she gets the

778
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:05,460
message, she'll beam to us.

779
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,601
SAM: All right.

780
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,362
LIAM: I've still got the other one. Right here.

781
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:10,798
TRAVIS: Great. We take the night, then.

782
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:11,980
LAURA: All right.

783
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,681
TALIESIN: I write a letter to my sister, letting
her know that I do apologize that we're sending

784
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:23,160
more people, but it's necessary, and I write her a
letter insisting that Pike be sent here by stone

785
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,323
immediately.

786
00:45:24,323 --> 00:45:25,373
MATT: Okay.

787
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:30,609
LIAM: (singing) D-E-A-R C-A-S-S, how are you? I'm
fine.

788
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,290
LAURA: What the fuck are you singing?

789
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,014
TALIESIN: (singing) Everybody else is too!

790
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:35,778
LIAM: Wow! You know what I'm doing!

791
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:37,223
TRAVIS: Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?

792
00:45:37,223 --> 00:45:38,195
LAURA: What was that?

793
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,272
TALIESIN: You are a nerd!

794
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:40,308
LIAM: A theatre nerd, yeah.

795
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:41,643
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are a theatre nerd.

796
00:45:41,643 --> 00:45:42,779
LAURA: Wow.

797
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:43,921
LIAM: Secret Garden, ladies and gentlemen.

798
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,578
TALIESIN: Secret Garden: The Musical. It's
magical.

799
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:51,444
LIAM: Can we have the break so Taliesin and I can
go make out in the other room?

800
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:55,039
MATT: Don't go on break for that! Just move your
seating arrangement.

801
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,785
TALIESIN: And suddenly the YouTube hits just go
through the roof.

802
00:45:58,785 --> 00:46:00,377
(laughter)

803
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:05,551
SAM: What injured people are going back? Have we
met these people yet? Can we meet them?

804
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:06,633
MATT: You haven't met them, no.

805
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:08,038
LAURA: Let's go find the injured.

806
00:46:08,038 --> 00:46:16,059
MATT: You guys are led with Keyleth as well. There
are two armed guards that are hobbling their way

807
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:21,160
through their patrols tonight as they've been
wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the

808
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:28,782
couple nights beforehand. There are a number of
just relatively sick people. Couple of children.

809
00:46:28,782 --> 00:46:36,086
Whether it be having to eat whatever was around to
stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in

810
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:41,713
travel, or just catching disease as when you have
clusters of people in cold environments,

811
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:46,586
especially cold, wet environments like this
tonight. It does tend to happen. Nothing seriously

812
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,900
life-threatening, but, you know, definitely
worrisome.

813
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:58,349
SAM: I try to find the one who's the most
able-bodied. Right? We're going to need someone to

814
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,514
go find Pike or deliver a message, right?

815
00:47:00,514 --> 00:47:01,576
LAURA: Yes.

816
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,363
TALIESIN: It's going to be whoever's organizing
it.

817
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:08,272
SAM: Is someone going who's not injured to
transport these people?

818
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:12,831
MATT: Possibly. And you can organize whoever you'd
like. Someone you know, you could bring along.

819
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,413
MARISHA: Well, I start attending to the children
first.

820
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:20,857
MATT: Okay. So you tend to the children, helping
them feel comfortable, deal with any wounds,

821
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:26,147
scrapes, relative inconveniences, and it's easy
enough for you to take a moment to cure disease if

822
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:27,305
need be.

823
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:33,704
LAURA: Can we find any families with children and
maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we

824
00:47:33,704 --> 00:47:35,145
could send through?

825
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:38,546
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you manage to-- and with Elowen
and her son Simon as well--

826
00:47:38,546 --> 00:47:40,596
LAURA: Yes. Maybe Elowen could go?

827
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:41,925
TALIESIN: Elowen would be perfect.

828
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,805
MARISHA: Well, remember, we were able to get about
25 or so people through last time with the spell.

829
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:47,774
LAURA: How many sick people are there?

830
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:50,447
MATT: You see about seven or eight people that
could use it.

831
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:51,562
LAURA: Perfect.

832
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:53,309
MATT: So you can get a bunch of other folks
through as well.

833
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:54,347
MARISHA: Okay.

834
00:47:54,347 --> 00:47:57,666
LAURA: I talk to Elowen and ask if she can go find
Pike in the morning, if she wants to go through,

835
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,870
and all that kind of stuff.

836
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,823
MATT: "I'd be happy to, I--"

837
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:02,718
SAM: You remember what Pike looks like?

838
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:05,033
MATT: "Yeah. About your size, lightish hair--"

839
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:14,501
SAM: Hair the color of the sunset, eyes like
waves that crash in the night, breasts, supple, firm--

840
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,582
TRAVIS: Okay, Scanlan. Scanlan.

841
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:18,220
ASHLEY: True, true, true.

842
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,532
(laughter)

843
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:23,991
MATT: "Right. Yes, I remember. I'll find her,
yes."

844
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:30,845
SAM: Smell of morning dew as it touches--

845
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:32,829
MATT: She begins to cover Simon's ears.

846
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,830
(laughter)

847
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,513
MATT: "All right, I think we should turn in for
the evening, but yes, I'll be happy to take care of it."

848
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:39,743
LIAM: Also of note, you're going to be going
through a tree.

849
00:48:39,743 --> 00:48:41,222
MATT: "What?"

850
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,562
LIAM: Just go with it. You're going to be--

851
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:45,807
MARISHA: Well, you know, you didn't have to tell
them that now. Could've just let it be a surprise.

852
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,046
LAURA: It's really fun, actually.

853
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:49,302
LIAM: It's kind of frightening, though, if you
don't know it's coming.

854
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,638
LAURA: You'll pop right out in Whitestone. It's
amazing.

855
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:52,918
LIAM: It's still a little weird for me, to be
honest.

856
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:54,500
MARISHA: Is it? Okay, that's good to know.

857
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:02,288
MATT: "All right. All right." So, as the evening
comes to completion, you're taking guard for the

858
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:03,704
course of the evening.

859
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:06,413
LAURA: I pop Trinket out and I sleep on him.

860
00:49:06,413 --> 00:49:07,767
TRAVIS: Very attentive.

861
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:08,968
MATT: (bear sound) He curls up.

862
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:10,073
LAURA: Hugs and hugs.

863
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,603
MATT: Yeah. Warm, fuzzy. Trinket makes for a very
good bed for one.

864
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,760
LAURA: Yes.

865
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,007
LIAM: I'm going to curl into the butt end, which
is all I get. All I ever got while we were traveling.

866
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:20,929
LAURA: Yeah. He farts on you all the time.

867
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,816
LIAM: I fart on him all the time.

868
00:49:22,816 --> 00:49:25,531
MATT: It's just a fart exchange. Back and forth,
forever.

869
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:28,191
LIAM: Bada-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang.

870
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:31,397
MATT: (laughs) That got weird. Did you want to do
anything for the evening?

871
00:49:31,397 --> 00:49:32,622
TRAVIS: No.

872
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:35,057
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

873
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,056
SAM: Oh boy.

874
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,514
LIAM: Oh crud. Big two!

875
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:41,933
TRAVIS: Big watch, big watch.

876
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:44,562
Nine!

877
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:45,750
LAURA: Ey-oh!

878
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,121
LIAM: Ey-oh! (exploding sounds)

879
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:49,020
MATT: Okay. All right. The evening goes by without
a hitch.

880
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,273
(groans)

881
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:52,614
LAURA: What would you have seen? What would you
have seen?

882
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:56,999
MATT: You all come to consciousness. You
eventually get your rest as well for the evening.

883
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:00,253
MARISHA: What didn't you see? Tell me what you
didn't see.

884
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:05,391
MATT: At this point, the tent city is back to a
bustling sound of folks going about their business

885
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:11,111
for the day, what kind of business that can be
done. The people that you've requested be sent

886
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:16,845
over to Whitestone have been gathered on the
outside, the western side of this small city area,

887
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:21,883
and some of the guards there are prepared to greet
you in preparation for sending these people over.

888
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:27,868
SAM: Keyleth, before we do this, there are no
trees here.

889
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:33,511
MARISHA: What? What do you mean? Are there trees
here?

890
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:40,863
MATT: No. It's a plain. I mean, there are the
occasional small tree, scattered in clusters

891
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,272
around, but you're in the grasslands.

892
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,905
MARISHA: I thought we were on the edge of a
forest.

893
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:45,233
SAM: There's no forest here.

894
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,308
MATT: The forest is south of you guys.

895
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,052
LAURA: We've got to walk them to the forest.

896
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:49,573
MARISHA: How fucking far are trees?

897
00:50:49,573 --> 00:50:51,715
MATT: I'd say, probably--

898
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,155
SAM: Four days' journey.

899
00:50:53,155 --> 00:51:02,931
MATT: No, from this area, it's most of a day's
travel. There are trees closer, but the forest is

900
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:04,102
that far.

901
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:08,242
MARISHA: I just need a tree to fit people through.
I need a person-width tree.

902
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:10,075
SAM: A giant tree.

903
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:13,814
MATT: To find a tree large enough to do this is
probably going to be about two hours' walking

904
00:51:13,814 --> 00:51:14,664
distance.

905
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:16,184
LAURA: Okay, we can walk for two hours.

906
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:17,349
MARISHA: That's a nice morning hike.

907
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:23,227
LAURA: You know what, I'm going to fly up. I'm
going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a

908
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,388
fucking tree.

909
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:25,622
SAM: Oh, you're going to scout?

910
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:26,870
LAURA: I'm going to scout for a tree.

911
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,800
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a perception
check.

912
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,926
TRAVIS: Why did you pick that as the word?

913
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:32,636
LAURA: I didn't think about it. I forgot.

914
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,926
TALIESIN: That was a great decision.

915
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,800
LAURA: 23.

916
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,238
MATT: 23. You find, actually, hiding just around
the bend of a series of small hills that butt up

917
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:51,501
against the southwestern side of the Foramere
Basin, there is a small cluster of trees, one of

918
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:55,474
which is the largest of the group, that may
function as a function of this that is only about

919
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:57,499
a 30-minute walk from these.

920
00:51:57,499 --> 00:51:59,509
MARISHA: That's doable. There we go.

921
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:03,921
LAURA: Fly back down and I tell them. I look along
the path, though, and make sure it's safe, the

922
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,463
walking back. Is it okay?

923
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:07,647
MATT: Yeah.

924
00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:10,531
LIAM: Hopefully nobody saw the comely half-elf
flying through the bright blue sky.

925
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:15,049
LAURA: I wear turquoise to blend in with the blue
surroundings.

926
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:20,081
MATT: You didn't blend in too well, as when you
crested over, a number of the families and kids

927
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:24,183
that were prepared were pointing up. "Mom, she's
flying!" People were excited to see you take off

928
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:28,152
into the distance. It was quite a display. Well
done.

929
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,973
LAURA: I do some circles around and wave.

930
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:32,328
LIAM: Maybe you can join Dr. Dranzel in the
circus.

931
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:36,919
LAURA: I hang off of it as I come down, like woo!
And then come back up.

932
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:39,516
MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check.

933
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:40,932
LAURA: Dexterity or acrobatics?

934
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:42,309
MATT: Dexterity.

935
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:43,451
LAURA: Damn it.

936
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,980
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

937
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:53,553
LAURA: I said as I come down. It was low. I was
low.

938
00:52:53,553 --> 00:53:02,614
MATT: So as Vex takes a moment to do some unique
tricks with her elaborate and long-running

939
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:12,442
experience directing brooms across the sky, she
gets a bit cocky and does a "look, ma, no hands"

940
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:19,414
moment. However, in doing so, the broom sputters
out from under the grasp of her legs, and suddenly

941
00:53:19,414 --> 00:53:25,150
goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as
you are, as you both begin to plummet.

942
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,626
LAURA: I grab for it! And (hacking spit) as I'm
grabbing for it.

943
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:32,117
LIAM: You can't fight the power of the one.

944
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:39,038
MATT: Unfortunately, you don't have any momentum
to go forward, and it's already coasted about 15,

945
00:53:39,038 --> 00:53:43,362
20 feet away from you, and there's nowhere to
swim. All the kids are like, "Yay!" Cheering, and

946
00:53:43,362 --> 00:53:47,081
all of a sudden you start falling, and they go
(screaming). And starts yelling.

947
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:50,569
TALIESIN: Which child in the crowd is going to
become Robin? I'm so excited.

948
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:54,326
MATT: I want you to go ahead and roll an
acrobatics check.

949
00:53:54,326 --> 00:53:57,755
TALIESIN: This is how we make a vigilante.

950
00:53:57,755 --> 00:53:59,516
LAURA: Okay, okay. 25.

951
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:13,369
MATT: 25, okay. So you only suffer nine points of
falling damage as you hit the ground and do a

952
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:20,585
tumble, land arms out and catch the broom, smiling
amongst the serious pain in your legs and back.

953
00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:23,460
LAURA: I'll bet you thought I was really falling!

954
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,074
MATT: All the kids are like, "Yay!" And start
cheering, clapping. Even the parents start

955
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:30,277
clapping. The guards start clapping, like, "That
was genuinely impressive." Played it off.

956
00:54:30,277 --> 00:54:34,114
TRAVIS: Blood trickles out of the ear from the
brain trauma.

957
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:37,721
(laughter)

958
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,752
SAM: Does the broom just fall, or does it shoot
off like a missile?

959
00:54:40,752 --> 00:54:45,334
MATT: It shoots off for a second, carrying the
momentum of the propulsion, and then it falls limp

960
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:49,237
as it no longer has the immediate connection with
the person. But she did catch it after she

961
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:50,129
tumbled.

962
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:51,281
SAM: Oh, okay, that's cool.

963
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:53,045
TALIESIN: Working on it.

964
00:54:53,045 --> 00:54:56,590
LAURA: I'm going to work on that trick, you guys,
and it's going to be amazing.

965
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,079
TALIESIN: I think it's perfect.

966
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,771
LIAM: Blood for the blood gods.

967
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:08,704
MATT: All right. Finding the tree, you guys walk,
and bringing the families and the children and the

968
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:13,884
people that were chosen to go to Whitestone,
Keyleth, you create your Transport via Plants

969
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:18,710
spell. (whoosh) The doorway opens, and it barely
fits onto this one half-dead willow that's

970
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,827
cresting the side there. Everyone (gasps).

971
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:23,201
MARISHA: We form the line, the ranks.

972
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,518
LIAM: Climb through, climb through, you have to
move quickly.

973
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:25,861
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go!

974
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:29,707
MATT: At the very end, Elowen's the last one
through, and she's holding the letter and she

975
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:34,807
looks back and says, "Promise," and leaps through
right as it closes in the tree. You look toward

976
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:37,016
the guards that were with you guys, who are just
watching this whole thing with their eyes wide

977
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:38,090
open.

978
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,193
TRAVIS: Glad you let us in, aren't you?

979
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:41,534
MATT: "Yeah."

980
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:45,791
MARISHA: I turn to him and I go, high five! Okay.

981
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:52,462
MATT: At this point, you see two figures walking
towards you at this southern forest.

982
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:54,509
SAM: Two figures walking towards us?

983
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:56,190
MATT: Towards you guys, rather hastily.

984
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,127
SAM: I draw my whip.

985
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:10,882
MATT: Okay. Whip's out. You glance over and, easy
enough to see, it is Drez Vina and this older

986
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:18,130
individual, both rushing up. Drez has his hand
up. "Excuse me, I'm sorry, pardon me!"

987
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,442
TALIESIN: Yes, hello? Hello?

988
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:24,454
MATT: "It has been some time, everyone. Pleasure
to see you again."

989
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:26,121
LAURA: We remember, dear.

990
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:30,821
MATT: "Wondrous, wondrous. I'm here with--" And as
he gestures, the old man puts his hand in front

991
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:39,173
and goes, "Would you please just let me talk for
once? Hello. I am--" And he looks over. "Has he

992
00:56:39,173 --> 00:56:45,345
"been giving you my-- I am Master Quall. Pleasure
to meet all of you."

993
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:46,769
SAM: Quall?

994
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:53,203
MATT: "I was the collector that had hired you in
previous times as Drez has recently made me aware,

995
00:56:53,203 --> 00:57:01,276
"and while our track record has been spotty, you
seem to be rather able-bodied, and whispers this

996
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:08,933
"morning that have come to my ears mention that you
have interest in returning to Westruun. Is that correct?"

997
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:11,341
SAM: To set it free, yes.

998
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:18,312
MATT: "Wondrous, wondrous." He looks over to Drez.
Drez goes, "Yes, well, you see, the master here

999
00:57:18,312 --> 00:57:27,776
"lives within Westruun, and-- " "I'm talking, I've
got this. My abode, which is a relatively humble

1000
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:37,967
"structure, two stories, bricks and dark wood,
southeast of the town square, right by the

1001
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:44,715
"fountain crossroads, I'm sure you've seen it
before. Since this whole endeavor has happened, it

1002
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:53,976
"has usurped a bit of progress in my
experimentation, and I would be remiss if I didn't

1003
00:57:53,976 --> 00:58:00,194
"request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a
very important piece of my collection so I might

1004
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:04,122
"continue this research in this desolate place."

1005
00:58:04,122 --> 00:58:06,788
LIAM: What are the subjects of your
experimentation?

1006
00:58:06,788 --> 00:58:16,294
MATT: "Various things. I enjoy finding out the
base elements of existence and life."

1007
00:58:16,294 --> 00:58:17,593
LAURA: Insight check.

1008
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:19,088
MATT: Insight check.

1009
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:26,857
LAURA: He's lying. 18.

1010
00:58:26,857 --> 00:58:29,415
MATT: 18.

1011
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:37,013
TALIESIN: God damn it.

1012
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,062
TRAVIS: Whispers!

1013
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:49,341
SAM: Dagger Dagger Dagger is one of the shirts
that's available. There's Strongjaw Ale. Strongjaw

1014
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:53,379
Ale available for sale. Check it out. Geek and
Sundry.

1015
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:58,369
TALIESIN: That's very interesting. Did you know
that I'm a collector as well, actually?

1016
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,081
MATT: "Really? Oh, quaint."

1017
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:01,482
TALIESIN: Of specifics.

1018
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:02,970
MATT: "Of what?"

1019
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,455
TALIESIN: Specifics. I see that you have not
really handed any over.

1020
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:15,245
MATT: "It may be a bit beyond your
understanding."

1021
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:18,116
LAURA: Very few things are beyond his
understanding.

1022
00:59:18,116 --> 00:59:29,538
MATT: "Very well. I appreciate the synergies
between various elements and the ability to link

1023
00:59:29,538 --> 00:59:38,149
"the essence with that of a living organic entity,
or the transition of such living essence into what

1024
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:40,780
"is normally non-living matter."

1025
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,194
MARISHA: So you're a necromancer.

1026
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,867
MATT: "No! I don't deal with that ridiculous
stuff."

1027
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:48,028
TALIESIN: He's talking about transmutation of some
kind.

1028
00:59:48,028 --> 00:59:53,965
MATT: "Yes, yes! Thank you. The transitioning of
essences or sparking essence within what was once

1029
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:58,588
"non-living matter. I'm talking about elements, I'm
not talking about flesh."

1030
00:59:58,588 --> 00:59:59,931
MARISHA: Like natural elements?

1031
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:01,319
LAURA: Like golems.

1032
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:05,679
TALIESIN: It's the veganism of necromancy. It's
just kind of dull.

1033
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:06,685
MATT: "What was that?"

1034
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:07,738
TALIESIN: Nothing.

1035
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:18,894
MATT: "Now, I had previously asked you to retrieve
an item in the past. That was part of this

1036
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:27,054
"research and I was nearing a breakthrough, I
believe. However, if you could find your way into

1037
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:35,636
"this abode and retrieve for me-- It's in the
basement, amongst my work desk area. It's a simple

1038
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:43,455
"dark iron and cobalt circlet. A band, if you will.
If you could retrieve that for me, I would make it

1039
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:47,008
"quite worth your while and be ever-grateful and in
your service."

1040
01:00:47,008 --> 01:00:50,518
LIAM: What are we talking about, a pile of coin,
or something else?

1041
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:56,885
MATT: "As I said before, I am quite the collector,
and while I do hate to relinquish my grasp on

1042
01:00:56,885 --> 01:01:03,946
"various parts of this collection, for someone who
does me a grand favor, I am willing to look the

1043
01:01:03,946 --> 01:01:06,650
"other way as one might disappear."

1044
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,423
LAURA: What does the circlet do?

1045
01:01:08,423 --> 01:01:11,030
MATT: "It's more of an experimental piece."

1046
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:15,983
LIAM: Come on. Don't treat us like a bunch of
fucking assholes. It's in the middle of shit right

1047
01:01:15,983 --> 01:01:20,265
now. We're not going to go in there for a trinket.
It's obviously something very worthwhile. You

1048
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:23,291
would have a better chance with us if you're
honest.

1049
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:27,550
MATT: Drez at this point steps forward and goes,
"I would appreciate if you respected the master

1050
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,868
"for his research. He is going to offer you a great
guide."

1051
01:01:30,868 --> 01:01:32,241
MARISHA: Oh, shut up, Drez.

1052
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:36,723
LIAM: Yeah, you're an asshole. You're the biggest
asshole. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to

1053
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:40,339
you. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.

1054
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:45,691
MATT: "Sir, perhaps we need to--" At which point
he looks over and the master's like (cackling).

1055
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:49,879
"About time someone called you on it."

1056
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:57,096
SAM: Master Quall. We're looking for the Vestiges
of Divergence.

1057
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:59,420
LAURA: Scanlan, what the fuck?

1058
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,704
SAM: Oh, am I not supposed to say that? Do you
know where those are? That's what we want. If you

1059
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:08,691
can offer us one of those, we'll do business with
you. Otherwise, we're going to fuck off.

1060
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:13,703
MARISHA: Wait, he might. Look, Master Quall.
Finish what you were saying first.

1061
01:02:13,703 --> 01:02:20,021
MATT: "Yes. I've heard of this title before. You
say you're seeking them, are you?"

1062
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:22,339
SAM: I am. Not them.

1063
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:26,273
MATT: "Where are you seeking these? Whereabouts
are you off to?"

1064
01:02:26,273 --> 01:02:27,487
MARISHA: Well, we were headed towards--

1065
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:29,242
SAM: We don't know where they are.

1066
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:33,141
LAURA: They're all sorts of different places.
We're trying to figure that out right now. We're

1067
01:02:33,141 --> 01:02:35,959
not exactly sure. We're not exactly sure,
Keyleth.

1068
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:37,525
SAM: We thought you might know.

1069
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:42,484
MARISHA: How is what we're seeking less important
than where we're seeking it? I'm really confused.

1070
01:02:42,484 --> 01:02:46,885
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, just in case we mention
where we might be looking for them, in front of

1071
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:48,664
these people.

1072
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,644
LAURA: Because what if he goes to find them?

1073
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:52,158
MATT: "Don't worry."

1074
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:54,956
MARISHA: Does he look like the man capable of
going and finding things? He's trying to send us

1075
01:02:54,956 --> 01:02:58,671
back into his own god damn basement to get his own
shit.

1076
01:02:58,671 --> 01:03:05,247
MATT: "See, there is a woman who speaks both her
mind and a mind of quite acute truth."

1077
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:07,172
SAM: She is cute.

1078
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:10,541
LAURA: Is it morning yet? Can Pike come join us
yet?

1079
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:14,114
SAM: She is being sought.

1080
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:18,560
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
there's a little (crackling) flash of divine

1081
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:24,342
energy before you, and a slight popping sound as
out of the middle of the air next to you, there

1082
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:29,561
comes, jogging in, a freshly winded, fully armored
Pike.

1083
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:34,700
SAM: What an entrance!

1084
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,635
TALIESIN: See, you start arguing and you just make
a gnome. This is what happens.

1085
01:03:39,635 --> 01:03:45,289
TRAVIS: I run over and I pick up Pike and I spin
her around in a big bear hug.

1086
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:48,301
ASHLEY: Hey, Grog!

1087
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:53,204
TRAVIS: Oh, my little buddy Pike. We missed you.

1088
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,546
ASHLEY: Oh, I missed you guys.

1089
01:03:55,546 --> 01:03:57,250
MARISHA: Hi, Pike!

1090
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,417
ASHLEY: Hey guys! Oh, who are these two?

1091
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:05,328
MATT: At this point, Master Quall is going through
a series of notes. He goes, "I'm very certain this

1092
01:04:05,328 --> 01:04:07,176
"gnome was not created."

1093
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,240
MARISHA: And you remember Drez.

1094
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:16,353
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. Mr. Vina. Drez Vina.

1095
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:21,199
MATT: "Yes. It is a delight to see you as well,
small one."

1096
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:22,827
ASHLEY: Hi!

1097
01:04:22,827 --> 01:04:26,172
MATT: "Well, this grew very complicated."

1098
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:27,604
TALIESIN: Master Quall.

1099
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:28,469
MATT: "Yes."

1100
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:33,014
TALIESIN: Let's lay the cards on the table. If we
find this thing of yours in your basement, and if

1101
01:04:33,014 --> 01:04:38,258
we go to your home, we are certainly going to go
into the basement and find it now regardless,

1102
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:42,171
we're going to figure out what it is before we
give it to you anyway. The world is dangerous

1103
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:47,970
right now, and it is not appropriate to just be
handing mystical artifacts of great strength

1104
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,666
willy-nilly to anybody who asks. The world is
dangerous and we need to make sure that power is

1105
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:56,015
flowing in the correct direction. Now, you can
either be forthright with that and get your

1106
01:04:56,015 --> 01:05:01,646
property, or we can find it in your basement and
experiment on it until we know what it is.

1107
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:04,335
MATT: "Good luck even attempting such an
endeavor."

1108
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:08,638
TALIESIN: I have very good luck attempting these
endeavors.

1109
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:17,336
MATT: "Well. Let's just say that it's a device
that, when completed, to the specialty of my own

1110
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:24,847
"training and studies, would enable me the means of
personal defense to get me through these rather

1111
01:05:24,847 --> 01:05:30,236
"difficult and dangerous times. As I am not getting
any younger and it seems that we're having

1112
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:35,761
"entities of great power and mischief intent on
destruction continuously tearing down my very

1113
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:42,453
"doorways--" He looks off in the direction of
Westruun. "I would feel more comfortable if I

1114
01:05:42,453 --> 01:05:48,838
"could keep myself well guarded. And that is what
this circlet is intended to provide."

1115
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:51,344
LAURA: Tell you what, Master Quall.

1116
01:05:51,344 --> 01:05:52,882
MATT: "Yes?"

1117
01:05:52,882 --> 01:06:00,811
LAURA: We're not heading there now, but we'll be
going back, and when we do, we will find your

1118
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:04,983
home, and we will search out this circlet.

1119
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:09,998
SAM: Well, hold on, before we just say no, what's
the reward? Do we know what you're paying for this?

1120
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:13,824
TALIESIN: Well, he's got a collection.

1121
01:06:13,824 --> 01:06:19,063
MATT: "A simple trade of my collection. You bring
me one of my items, and I gift you one of mine as well."

1122
01:06:19,063 --> 01:06:21,267
TALIESIN: I personally feel this is reasonable.

1123
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:23,984
MARISHA: I'm curious if you could be more
beneficial in paying us with

1124
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:26,104
information. With knowledge.

1125
01:06:26,104 --> 01:06:28,828
LAURA: As well as something from your collection.

1126
01:06:28,828 --> 01:06:35,747
MATT: "I am more than willing to offer information
for trade. It is quite a grand trade indeed. If

1127
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:37,232
"that is acceptable."

1128
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:42,079
LAURA: No, we would want something as well,
physically.

1129
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,459
TALIESIN: This is a deposit of information.

1130
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:50,181
MATT: "All right. Then, as part of the deposit,
what do you require of me?"

1131
01:06:50,181 --> 01:06:55,603
MARISHA: Are you familiar with a sphinx named
Osysa?

1132
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:57,129
MATT: "Can't say that I am."

1133
01:06:57,129 --> 01:07:00,211
MARISHA: Resides up-- No?

1134
01:07:00,211 --> 01:07:03,301
TALIESIN: What does he know, perhaps, of the--
no?

1135
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:11,537
MARISHA: Are you familiar with any other sphinxes
that reside in this area? Do you know the address?

1136
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:18,250
MATT: "I'm sorry, but they don't really wander in
open daylight."

1137
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,197
LAURA: Do you know where they wander?

1138
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:24,631
TALIESIN: In darkness, if they don't wander in
open daylight.

1139
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:28,796
MATT: He gives a curious look at both of you. "I
am not a master of mythology. I do not know of

1140
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:32,995
"such entities and where they might reside or
exist. I apologize."

1141
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:40,953
MARISHA: Well, you do seem to be a master of
items. We are looking for certain special Vestiges.

1142
01:07:40,953 --> 01:07:46,286
MATT: "So you say. And you're saying this sphinx
may want to help you in this endeavor?"

1143
01:07:46,286 --> 01:07:50,265
MARISHA: We're not sure yet.

1144
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:52,559
TALIESIN: It's a long walk.

1145
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:59,098
MARISHA: We thought maybe he could help us find
them, but maybe you could be of a similar service.

1146
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:06,619
MATT: "Well. What I do have--" And he turns
around. "Come with me to my tent, please. I may

1147
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:08,380
"have something that can be of service to you."

1148
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,670
MARISHA: Sure.

1149
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,949
LAURA: I give Pike a hug as we walk to his tent.

1150
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:20,310
SAM: Actually, I pull Pike aside and say-- Well,
not aside. I just ask her, how's Whitestone?

1151
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,739
What's going on there?

1152
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:29,949
ASHLEY: Well, it's okay. I think I got to the
point where I couldn't build anymore, heal any

1153
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:38,167
more people. I needed a little adventure. But
everything is as you would think it would be.

1154
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:41,624
SAM: No dragon attacks?

1155
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:48,351
ASHLEY: None at the moment. We've been trying to
hold down the place as much as we can, and getting

1156
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:52,869
there seems to be okay.

1157
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:57,229
LIAM: I did not go up to Pike. I hung way the fuck
back.

1158
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:06,737
MATT: All right. You guys eventually make your
way back to the small outpost, at this point, to

1159
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:11,771
the tent of Drez Vina and Master Quall. Master
Quall steps inside. You hear him rummaging through

1160
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:16,175
some things. Something rolls and breaks, and you
hear, "Oh, damn it!" from the inside. He comes

1161
01:09:16,175 --> 01:09:24,002
back out and goes, "All right, so, this." And he
holds up this small glass bauble. The inside has a

1162
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:33,431
spinning, looks like a brass gyroscope-type
interior. He goes, "This item, when clasped and

1163
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:43,296
"concentrated on, should light up any sort of
nearby magical incantations or enchantments. This,

1164
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:48,432
"if you are in the presence of such objects as you
are seeking, should be quite helpful in locating

1165
01:09:48,432 --> 01:09:53,363
"their presence. It does not have an incredibly
long range, but it should, at the very least, be

1166
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:54,688
"somewhat helpful."

1167
01:09:54,688 --> 01:09:55,986
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

1168
01:09:55,986 --> 01:09:57,651
SAM: You're giving this to us?

1169
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:02,061
MATT: "I'm lending it to you. Should you wish this
to be part of the trade instead of something from

1170
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:03,024
"my collection..."

1171
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:04,410
LAURA: No no no. Lending is--

1172
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,523
TALIESIN: Lending is perfectly agreeable.

1173
01:10:06,523 --> 01:10:10,868
MATT: "Now I have lent you something in the past,
and not only did it not return to me, but I had to

1174
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:16,737
"extract the funds by forcing another contract on
you. Can I trust you to complete this endeavor?"

1175
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:22,096
SAM: You can trust us, as far as Grog can throw
me.

1176
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:23,934
TRAVIS: Pretty fucking far.

1177
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:25,305
TALIESIN: You can trust her.

1178
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:29,062
MATT: "Deal." And he hands it out.

1179
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:34,616
TRAVIS: We will make our way into the city, and
when we do, we will look for your items.

1180
01:10:34,616 --> 01:10:36,754
MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that."

1181
01:10:36,754 --> 01:10:42,334
SAM: Or we could just send Vex on a broom right
now to get it solo--

1182
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,941
MARISHA: Wait, what? What?

1183
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:49,641
TALIESIN: We are not flying a half-elf into the
city on a broom that she has already fallen off of

1184
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:51,272
in the last 24 hours.

1185
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:52,320
LIAM: Archers!

1186
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:58,606
LAURA: I am recovering a bit right now, but thank
you for the wonderful, wonderful idea, Scanlan!

1187
01:10:58,606 --> 01:11:00,301
SAM: I think you can do it. I think you can do
it.

1188
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:02,166
LAURA: Thank you! I appreciate the vote of
confidence.

1189
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,360
LIAM: He is a tactician.

1190
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,899
MARISHA: Hey, what might this item be called, Sir
Quall?

1191
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:13,482
MATT: "I haven't named it, actually. I made it for
myself. Call it what you like."

1192
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:17,907
SAM: How about "The Hunk of Quall"?

1193
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:20,265
MARISHA: The Hunk of Quall.

1194
01:11:20,265 --> 01:11:22,937
MATT: "Should you wish, certainly."

1195
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:25,280
TALIESIN: Didn't we had a conversation about
letting him name things?

1196
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,002
I feel like we had this conversation.

1197
01:11:27,002 --> 01:11:28,274
TRAVIS: Always do it, right?

1198
01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:32,250
MATT: "Enjoy carrying among yourselves The Hunk of
Quall."

1199
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,709
TRAVIS: Thank you. Drez Vina, it hasn't been a
pleasure, nice to see you.

1200
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:41,870
MATT: Drez crosses his arms, "Indeed. All right,
good luck."

1201
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,138
TRAVIS: And can I take Pike around the shoulder
and lead her out of the tent?

1202
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:48,262
MATT: Yeah.

1203
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,044
TRAVIS: Hey, hey... hey, Pike?

1204
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:52,099
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1205
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:57,787
TRAVIS: So I'm glad things have been good at
Whitestone. They've been good, yeah?

1206
01:11:57,787 --> 01:12:02,557
ASHLEY: Yeah, they've been all right, I mean, it's
okay, I've been missing you guys, though.

1207
01:12:02,557 --> 01:12:10,019
TRAVIS: Yeah, we miss you a whole lot. Listen,
I've got some rough news, actually. We made it

1208
01:12:10,019 --> 01:12:17,817
back to Westruun, and the city has kind of been
ransacked and overtaken. It was attacked by a

1209
01:12:17,817 --> 01:12:24,793
bunch of dragons, and what's worse is that after
it was attacked-- you know that herd of wandering

1210
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:28,367
goliaths that left me for dead in the woods?

1211
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:29,403
ASHLEY: Of course.

1212
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:39,002
TRAVIS: Yeah, they've kind of taken control of the
city, and I think that's my family that's in there.

1213
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:40,615
ASHLEY: Oh no.

1214
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:49,694
TRAVIS: Yeah. Look, we wanted to go in, I wanted
to look for Wilhand, but we haven't done it yet, and--

1215
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:53,435
ASHLEY: Have you heard anything else? Do you think
they are okay?

1216
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:59,252
TRAVIS: I don't know. Some of us went in via mist
and they haven't seen him, but they don't really

1217
01:12:59,252 --> 01:13:06,514
know what he looks like. The place looks pretty
rough, he's not here in this little encampment.

1218
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:09,413
I'm not really sure where he is.

1219
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:18,469
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I wonder if we should go look
for him

1220
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:24,706
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to, but like, listen. I'm
afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy.

1221
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:29,277
They're going to be there, in the city, and I was
wondering what you might think about going to look

1222
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:34,280
for a few other more Vestiges, trying to find
Osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything

1223
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:39,010
that can help us, because it's going to be a
fight, right? And you know me:

1224
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:41,564
I fucking love a fight, but--

1225
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:42,740
ASHLEY: That's a lot of them.

1226
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,604
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a lot.

1227
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:48,403
ASHLEY: I think we should wait until we're fully
prepared.

1228
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:50,823
TRAVIS: Yeah, you think so?

1229
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:54,620
ASHLEY: I think so. I don't think it's safe any
other way.

1230
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,992
TRAVIS: I missed you so much!

1231
01:13:56,992 --> 01:13:59,558
ASHLEY: Oh Grog, I missed you too!

1232
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:04,230
TRAVIS: And I cry a little bit into my beard, and
I wipe it away I'm like: Oh! The pollen out in

1233
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,175
these fields is awful!

1234
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,728
(laughter)

1235
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:13,533
ASHLEY: It's okay, Grog! I give him a hug, and I
take my blue scarf and I pat his eyes.

1236
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,221
ALL: Oh!

1237
01:14:16,221 --> 01:14:18,455
TRAVIS: (crying) It's raining!

1238
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:26,249
(laughter)

1239
01:14:26,249 --> 01:14:32,104
TRAVIS: As soon as we find this out, if we find
nothing-- I promise, I pledge to you that we will

1240
01:14:32,104 --> 01:14:33,945
find Wilhand.

1241
01:14:33,945 --> 01:14:34,989
ASHLEY: Okay.

1242
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:36,671
TRAVIS: All right.

1243
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,382
MATT: All right.

1244
01:14:39,382 --> 01:14:44,977
SAM: So, is the task then to go find the
orcs that are keeping their people

1245
01:14:44,977 --> 01:14:46,839
hostage up in the Frostweald?

1246
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:52,500
LAURA: We head into the Frostweald, we find the
orcs and send them back and keep going and find

1247
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,706
this Sphinx-y mate.

1248
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:00,386
MARISHA: Did we have any other information
of where he is in the Frostweald

1249
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:03,754
or do we just know Frostweald?

1250
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:06,444
LAURA: We just know Frostweald. Pike?

1251
01:15:06,444 --> 01:15:13,016
MATT: The information that you received was,
somewhere in the base of the Stormcrest Mountains,

1252
01:15:13,016 --> 01:15:16,488
past the Frostweald.

1253
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:18,481
MARISHA: Past the Frostweald?

1254
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:22,637
LIAM: Through it to the base of the mountain.

1255
01:15:22,637 --> 01:15:24,118
LAURA: Of the what mountain?

1256
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:26,200
MATT: Stormcrest Mountains.

1257
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,494
LIAM: That's a real place.

1258
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:31,313
TRAVIS: Actually, Pike.

1259
01:15:31,313 --> 01:15:32,454
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1260
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:36,398
TRAVIS: I've been holding on to something, and I
think you might like it. I have these Gauntlets of

1261
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:46,423
Ogre Power, and I can't wear them anymore, because
I got some new stuff, and if you wear it, your

1262
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:49,242
strength score goes up to 19.

1263
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:50,482
ASHLEY: What!

1264
01:15:50,482 --> 01:15:53,681
TRAVIS: Do you want them? You have to attune to
them.

1265
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,389
ASHLEY: Do you think they'll fit?

1266
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:58,823
TRAVIS: I think they might shrink. I don't know,
though.

1267
01:15:58,823 --> 01:16:01,896
TALIESIN: Do you know what 19 means?

1268
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:03,239
TRAVIS: Isn't it like a French dish?

1269
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:06,179
LAURA: Yes.

1270
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,221
ASHLEY: I would love to wear those.

1271
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:14,265
TRAVIS: All right, and I give Pike the Gauntlets
of Ogre Power.

1272
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:18,313
MATT: As you guys take a short rest to prepare for
this, Ashley, you take some time with the

1273
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:21,846
gauntlets, and while you're looking them over and
taking your own armored gauntlets off and

1274
01:16:21,846 --> 01:16:29,608
replacing them with these, your hand goes-- It's
like placing a baseball into a bucket. It's so big

1275
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:36,512
around your arm. But then as you take a moment to
see the metal and reflect upon it, you can feel

1276
01:16:36,512 --> 01:16:43,792
the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly
intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins

1277
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:50,591
to creak almost, and it shrinks down, encases
itself to your forearm. While it doesn't match the

1278
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:56,870
metal of your armor, the silver-gold theme that
goes on along it with this weird ogreish face

1279
01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:00,761
that's built into the plate there, you feel
suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill

1280
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:07,035
through your body, and you're pretty confident
that this may be useful in the near future.

1281
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:09,186
LAURA: You're stronger than Grog now!

1282
01:17:09,186 --> 01:17:10,898
MATT: You are technically now stronger than Grog.

1283
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:14,319
ASHLEY: I let out a little battle cry. (battle
cry)

1284
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:18,277
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I go to give her a fist bump.

1285
01:17:18,277 --> 01:17:19,788
ASHLEY: I fist bump him!

1286
01:17:19,788 --> 01:17:21,514
MATT: And it hurts you a little bit.

1287
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:24,411
LAURA: Oh, shit! Pike is so strong!

1288
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:29,335
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Nice, Pike!

1289
01:17:29,335 --> 01:17:32,751
MATT: Pike, what was your strength before?

1290
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:37,815
ASHLEY: 13.

1291
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:41,296
MATT: Okay. At a 19, you're now at a plus four as
opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage

1292
01:17:41,296 --> 01:17:44,777
with your physical weapons.

1293
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:47,432
LIAM: You just Tyler Durden-ed out, son!

1294
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:55,346
MATT: So on your sheet, where it has your attack
bonus with your mace, or with your morningstar,

1295
01:17:55,346 --> 01:18:03,468
and the damage, add a plus three to both the
attack bonus and damage.

1296
01:18:03,468 --> 01:18:08,310
ASHLEY: All right, because right now my attack
bonus is plus seven, so I add three to that.

1297
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,605
MATT: It's now plus ten.

1298
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:12,018
LAURA: Holy moley!

1299
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:16,444
MARISHA: That's so cool! You're a beast!

1300
01:18:16,444 --> 01:18:20,275
LIAM: Little golden bullet.

1301
01:18:20,275 --> 01:18:32,192
ASHLEY: I can't find a pencil! That's okay, I'll
make a note. I can do it later. I am unprepared.

1302
01:18:32,192 --> 01:18:40,530
Yes, I am unprepared for all this strength!

1303
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,534
TRAVIS: Right, so now we have all our stuff.
Should we make our way towards that area they said

1304
01:18:44,534 --> 01:18:46,627
that the orc raiders were coming from?

1305
01:18:46,627 --> 01:18:49,655
SAM: Yeah, it's a couple days from here?

1306
01:18:49,655 --> 01:18:52,459
MATT: On foot travel, it's about a day and a
half.

1307
01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:54,037
SAM: For mist form?

1308
01:18:54,037 --> 01:18:55,722
MATT: Mist form, you'll get there by nightfall.

1309
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:58,789
LAURA: But we can't use it, because she already
used the travel through the trees.

1310
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,652
MARISHA: Sorry.

1311
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:04,152
LAURA: But we saved all those people, Scanlan.

1312
01:19:04,152 --> 01:19:08,084
SAM: Pike, can you make us mist?

1313
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:10,390
ASHLEY: No, I can't do anything like that.

1314
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:11,980
SAM: All right.

1315
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,539
LAURA: Let's walk.

1316
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:16,667
ASHLEY: I feel like I haven't spent any time with
Vax.

1317
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:20,963
SAM: With Vax? Oh, he's around. You know, he's
probably just sulking.

1318
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:23,122
LIAM: I walk away.

1319
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:27,807
MATT: You glance back and see Vax towards the back
of the group. Noticing this conversation, Vax

1320
01:19:27,807 --> 01:19:31,853
immediately turns around and walks away and dodges
around one of the nearby tents.

1321
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:33,387
LIAM: Big nope to that one.

1322
01:19:33,387 --> 01:19:35,627
TRAVIS: What is the weather like outside?

1323
01:19:35,627 --> 01:19:40,166
MATT: Actually, today it's spotty clouds, but blue
sky. It's actually pretty good weather, versus a

1324
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,370
lot of the rain that you had over in Vasselheim.

1325
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,906
TRAVIS: Cold, snowy on the ground?

1326
01:19:43,906 --> 01:19:49,337
MATT: No. Because you're getting a little further
south than the northern area of it, the

1327
01:19:49,337 --> 01:19:53,362
temperature is probably around high 70s, low 80s.

1328
01:19:53,362 --> 01:19:57,985
LAURA: It is going to get cold, though, once we
head into the Frostweald. We had all those fancy

1329
01:19:57,985 --> 01:20:00,733
cloaks. I had winter's cloaks for all of us
before.

1330
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:02,276
TRAVIS: I still have mine.

1331
01:20:02,276 --> 01:20:04,504
LAURA: Does everyone still have their winter's
cloaks from a long time ago?

1332
01:20:04,504 --> 01:20:05,580
MARISHA: I do.

1333
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,925
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, yes, look at that.

1334
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:08,745
SAM: I didn't burn it.

1335
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:12,647
TRAVIS: Let's go.

1336
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:16,305
SAM: We're just going to walk? Do these refugees
have any horses or anything?

1337
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:18,161
LAURA: They're refugees.

1338
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:23,244
MATT: The few horses they do have are currently
quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of

1339
01:20:23,244 --> 01:20:28,514
burden for, if they have to move, to carry most
of their goods with them, as opposed to riding horses.

1340
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:30,635
TRAVIS: Come on, man, let's just hoof it.

1341
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:32,740
SAM: All right, we'll walk.

1342
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:37,389
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, are we walking? We haven't
walked anywhere in so long.

1343
01:20:37,389 --> 01:20:39,156
LIAM: It's like we're back in New York again.

1344
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:41,037
MARISHA: It's like we're level three again.

1345
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,698
MATT: And those horses will survive, because you
didn't take them.

1346
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:45,442
TRAVIS: Oh, that's fucked up.

1347
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:47,963
LAURA: That's really sad.

1348
01:20:47,963 --> 01:20:51,524
TRAVIS: Take a walk. Save a horse.

1349
01:20:51,524 --> 01:20:54,851
MATT: That's a good Vox Machina bumper sticker.

1350
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:57,477
TALIESIN: My other horse is walking.

1351
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:01,514
TRAVIS: Coming to the Geek and Sundry store.

1352
01:21:01,514 --> 01:21:09,070
MATT: All right. You guys make your Fellowship
trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot.

1353
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:14,002
LAURA: I constantly keep an eye out for anything
in the front of us and behind us.

1354
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:18,410
MATT: Thankfully, most of these fields, of varying
degrees of grass height, but for the most part

1355
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:23,334
it's pretty wide vision of where you're heading.

1356
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:26,027
MARISHA: I paint pictures in the clouds as we go.

1357
01:21:26,027 --> 01:21:30,123
LAURA: Oh, that's good. That'll definitely not let
anyone know magical people are on their way.

1358
01:21:30,123 --> 01:21:33,967
TALIESIN: Just point arrows in the opposite
direction.

1359
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:38,943
TRAVIS: Graffiti as we go.

1360
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:42,075
ASHLEY: Can I insight-check Vax?

1361
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:51,506
MATT: Sure. Roll an insight check.

1362
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:58,037
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

1363
01:21:58,037 --> 01:21:59,806
MATT: I believe you.

1364
01:21:59,806 --> 01:22:01,754
MARISHA: This never happens.

1365
01:22:01,754 --> 01:22:06,440
SAM: You just saw all of his dirty dreams.

1366
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:12,729
MATT: What does she see and read on your face and
body language, Vax?

1367
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:14,071
LIAM: I got to say this?

1368
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:17,215
MATT: I can say it, if you want to.

1369
01:22:17,215 --> 01:22:21,351
LIAM: I don't want these assholes to know what I'm
thinking. I don't know. Can't whisper it to her.

1370
01:22:21,351 --> 01:22:23,093
MATT: You can text it to her real fast, if you
want.

1371
01:22:23,093 --> 01:22:25,089
LIAM: Yeah, I'll text it to you.

1372
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:27,286
LAURA: But put it on Twitter so that everybody
else knows what it is.

1373
01:22:27,286 --> 01:22:28,568
LIAM: No.

1374
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,436
ASHLEY: I'll post it.

1375
01:22:30,436 --> 01:22:33,695
MATT: Okay, so you'll have an incoming text of
information. As you guys continue walking, these

1376
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:40,205
are the observations you make of Vax as you travel
southward. You travel for the better part of a

1377
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:47,464
day. You get quite a bit south. You do see in the
distance a few times what appear to be some pack

1378
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:53,172
animals, some larger beasts that roam the land,
none that are necessarily aggressive unless you

1379
01:22:53,172 --> 01:22:56,140
encroach upon their territory, and Keyleth, you
have experience with some of these beasts, so you

1380
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:03,432
manage to keep people at bay and traverse around
what they claim as their own landscape. No

1381
01:23:03,432 --> 01:23:08,881
terrible detriment to your traveling speed. You
make your way to the point where the sun goes

1382
01:23:08,881 --> 01:23:14,518
down. You can stop and camp for the night or you
can push through the evening. What do you wish to do?

1383
01:23:14,518 --> 01:23:18,961
MARISHA: Are there any trees nearby?

1384
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:24,175
MATT: Little periods here, little tiny groves that
might be spotty along your journey, but for the

1385
01:23:24,175 --> 01:23:25,541
most part it's open fields.

1386
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:28,759
MARISHA: How much further do we have, do you
think?

1387
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:31,379
MATT: One more day. One more eight-hour period of
travel.

1388
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:39,801
LAURA: We should probably rest, then, right? We'll
be hitting the Frostweald at night tomorrow.

1389
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:42,157
TALIESIN: We're not in a rush.

1390
01:23:42,157 --> 01:23:48,500
LAURA: Not anymore. The dragons are bunkered down,
I believe.

1391
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:53,054
TALIESIN: Everything we do now is measured in
weeks and months and not days.

1392
01:23:53,054 --> 01:24:01,797
LAURA: And I still have a little dried blood on
the outside of my ear. I could use a bit of rest.

1393
01:24:01,797 --> 01:24:06,610
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, do you have a
concussion? Is that something that we can-- how

1394
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,305
many fingers am I holding up?

1395
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:10,201
LAURA: You're really blurry, Percy, I have no
idea.

1396
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:11,337
TRAVIS: Nine!

1397
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:16,688
MATT: Save versus brain swelling. Are you guys
setting up camp?

1398
01:24:16,688 --> 01:24:19,298
LAURA: I want to pull my brother aside when we set
up camp.

1399
01:24:19,298 --> 01:24:23,278
SAM: Do we want camp, or do you want to sleep in a
mansion?

1400
01:24:23,278 --> 01:24:25,523
LAURA: Pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion!

1401
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:28,187
MARISHA: Oh, you have to show her the marble
floors.

1402
01:24:28,187 --> 01:24:30,968
TALIESIN: Do we want to do it now, or do we want
to do it tomorrow night, is the question?

1403
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:32,265
SAM: We can do it both.

1404
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:34,212
LAURA: Oh, that's right-- We can do it both
nights?

1405
01:24:34,212 --> 01:24:37,469
SAM: I can do it every day, right?

1406
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:38,709
ASHLEY: Where do you have a mansion?

1407
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:40,733
LAURA: Scanlan has a mansion, Pike!

1408
01:24:40,733 --> 01:24:48,085
SAM: I inherited some money. It's a long story.
There was a great-uncle Vesuvius.

1409
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:52,342
TALIESIN: Also known as Uncle Touchy. Uncle
No-No.

1410
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:53,796
LIAM: Canon, that's canon.

1411
01:24:53,796 --> 01:25:02,615
SAM: The court said that he had to give me-- No.
We'll sleep in the mansion tonight, and they all

1412
01:25:02,615 --> 01:25:07,933
know where they're sleeping, but I'll personally
show Pike to her chambers, which are right next

1413
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:14,791
door to mine at the end of the long hallway. My
room, obviously, the biggest, tallest. Pike's a

1414
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:21,798
close second. Beautiful, covered in yellow rose
petals as far as you can see.

1415
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:26,078
MATT: So, Pike, as Scanlan creates this somewhat
shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle

1416
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:29,666
of the air off of the path you guys have been
walking, in the middle of this field. It's just

1417
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,353
the open grass that's blowing with this gentle
night breeze, a little bit of the moonlight is

1418
01:25:33,353 --> 01:25:39,811
coming through the clouds, giving enough of a
visual of this change in the air space. He pushes

1419
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:44,602
open the shimmering door, and on the inside is
this beautiful mansion. Tall foyer with marble

1420
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:50,665
floors, pillars that raise to the ceiling with
gold trim. There's a giant portrait in the center

1421
01:25:50,665 --> 01:26:04,784
of the main stairway now that has both Scanlan and
you on horseback over a beautiful landscape. There

1422
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:12,795
are a number of mystical servants that are
somewhat transparent and spiritual, arcane energy

1423
01:26:12,795 --> 01:26:19,691
in form, that take your coats and offer food. A
delicious meal is presented for all of you.

1424
01:26:19,691 --> 01:26:20,951
SAM: Mostly chicken.

1425
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:23,152
MATT: It's mostly chicken. It's a lot of chicken.

1426
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:26,852
LAURA: I'm having a lot of talk with the servants
about different ways to prepare food.

1427
01:26:26,852 --> 01:26:27,932
SAM: Please do.

1428
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,722
TALIESIN: They keep clucking it up.

1429
01:26:30,722 --> 01:26:36,986
MATT: Protein, bro! Scanlan does lead you to your
room, which is right next to his, and covered in

1430
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:41,926
yellow rose petals, a beautiful interior. The
color scheme is marked tailored specifically to

1431
01:26:41,926 --> 01:26:45,789
your tastes that he's been able to glean from
conversations with you over the past couple years.

1432
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:52,762
SAM: Blues, silvers. There's a little mini prayer
area for her to pray to Sarenrae, and there's a

1433
01:26:52,762 --> 01:27:03,036
little statue of Sarenrae, and if you pull it, a
little secret door opens to my room. But it's a

1434
01:27:03,036 --> 01:27:05,217
small door that only a gnome could fit through.

1435
01:27:05,217 --> 01:27:07,331
ASHLEY: Oh, great! Is there a lock on that,
maybe?

1436
01:27:07,331 --> 01:27:11,983
(laughter)

1437
01:27:11,983 --> 01:27:14,519
SAM: Only on my side.

1438
01:27:14,519 --> 01:27:19,959
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, this is beautiful, Scanlan!

1439
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:26,064
SAM: I did it for you. And, hey, while we have a
moment alone, can I just mention something to you?

1440
01:27:26,064 --> 01:27:34,767
Listen, I'm not really concerned with other
people's vices or bad behaviors, but Grog has this

1441
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:48,850
sword, and it's sort of not good. It could be used
for good, possibly, but I'm just worried about it.

1442
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:53,116
Just keep an eye on it. I don't know what it is,
and maybe you could just check it out next time

1443
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:56,761
you're friending it up with him.

1444
01:27:56,761 --> 01:28:03,488
ASHLEY: Okay. When they had that fight with Percy,
up in the house, I felt like there was something

1445
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:10,528
weird with that sword. I'll check it out.

1446
01:28:10,528 --> 01:28:16,672
SAM: I don't want to judge him or what he does,
but just make sure that it won't kill any of us.

1447
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:18,312
That's all I care about.

1448
01:28:18,312 --> 01:28:24,501
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a good plan. Okay, I will.
Thanks, Scanlan.

1449
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:29,900
SAM: Sleep tight. And if you hear any
footsteps in your room, it's not me.

1450
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:35,962
It's the servants, I assure you.

1451
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:39,355
LAURA: Can I find-- Is there a library in the
mansion, Scanlan?

1452
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,756
SAM: Of course.

1453
01:28:40,756 --> 01:28:43,952
LAURA: Can I pull my brother into a library or
something? I just want to talk to you.

1454
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:46,201
LIAM: What? What?

1455
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:55,321
LAURA: Okay, weirdo. I couldn't help but notice,
anywhere Pike was, you were not, all day today,

1456
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:58,000
and I have a feeling it's because--

1457
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,868
LIAM: You want to talk?

1458
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:16,740
LAURA: Yes. I do. Don't walk away from me, please.
I have a feeling it's because of this Raven Queen

1459
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:26,896
situation. I don't know. I know that you offered
yourself to her to save me, and I can't put into

1460
01:29:26,896 --> 01:29:37,474
words how much that means to me. I'm worried that
she took you up on the offer, and I know you're

1461
01:29:37,474 --> 01:29:48,140
worried about it, too. And I'm afraid that's why
you're avoiding Pike. You're afraid she's going to

1462
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:58,471
see something in you. But I wanted to tell you,
I've been looking through this book. It's the best

1463
01:29:58,471 --> 01:30:03,251
35 gold I've ever spent. Maybe it was 30 gold, I
don't even remember anymore.

1464
01:30:03,251 --> 01:30:04,498
LIAM: It was 30.

1465
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:08,744
LAURA: It was 30! It would have been worth 35 for
all the things that I found in it! Look, it's got

1466
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:13,768
all this information about the Raven Queen, and
I've been looking at it all the time. I don't

1467
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:20,976
think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is.
Can I tell you what I found?

1468
01:30:20,976 --> 01:30:24,109
LIAM: Yes, please.

1469
01:30:24,109 --> 01:30:31,573
LAURA: It says that those that follow her must
hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for

1470
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:38,583
death is the natural end of life. That's not bad.
Bring down the proud who try to cast off the

1471
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:44,397
chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven
Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.

1472
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:53,846
Bring down those who try to cast off the chains of
fate. The Raven Queen represents death, right?

1473
01:30:53,846 --> 01:31:00,794
Therefore she hates those that live an immortal
life. She hates vampires! We hate vampires!

1474
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:10,201
They're terrible people, right? That's not bad!
Watch for the cult of Orcus, and stamp them out

1475
01:31:10,201 --> 01:31:17,231
whenever they arise. Orcus is bad. If she hates
him, then she must not be that terrible.

1476
01:31:17,231 --> 01:31:26,038
LIAM: She's already speaking to me.

1477
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:28,800
LAURA: Oh. And?

1478
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:36,601
LIAM: I don't know, Vex'ahlia. I don't know what
this means. I know that she's not a force for

1479
01:31:36,601 --> 01:31:41,189
evil. Neither are funeral homes. I don't want to
bed down in one.

1480
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:45,121
LAURA: Well, that's understandable.

1481
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:55,617
LIAM: But it doesn't matter. And I'd do it again,
because I did it for you, and I am trying to come

1482
01:31:55,617 --> 01:31:59,251
to terms with it, not knowing the terms.

1483
01:31:59,251 --> 01:32:13,026
LAURA: Well. We've lived half our life in the
shadows. You've made them your home. Am I right?

1484
01:32:13,026 --> 01:32:15,324
LIAM: Maybe so.

1485
01:32:15,324 --> 01:32:21,413
LAURA: This is a time you can either let those
shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a

1486
01:32:21,413 --> 01:32:33,278
hole, or you can use them to your advantage. You
can become a champion. It's pretty fucking badass,

1487
01:32:33,278 --> 01:32:34,960
if you ask me.

1488
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,802
LIAM: Do you know how bad this armor smells?

1489
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:41,650
LAURA: I can smell it, actually. Pretty terrible.

1490
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:44,307
LIAM: It's several centuries old. It's not
pleasant.

1491
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:46,855
LAURA: Maybe we can get you some oils or something
to put on it.

1492
01:32:46,855 --> 01:32:47,996
LIAM: Maybe.

1493
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:56,776
LAURA: What I'm saying is, brother, I'm proud of
you, and I'm happy for you, and I'm so, so

1494
01:32:56,776 --> 01:33:08,922
thankful for you. And you don't need to be
frightened! This is a wonderful thing. Not many

1495
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:13,746
fucking people can say they're a champion of a
fucking god.

1496
01:33:13,746 --> 01:33:26,344
LIAM: Listen. I'll take what you say under
consideration. Again, none of us, you and I don't

1497
01:33:26,344 --> 01:33:29,836
know what this means. I'm waiting to see.

1498
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:38,215
LAURA: All right. But as someone who's seen the
other side and has come back thanks to you,

1499
01:33:38,215 --> 01:33:51,220
there's no use living your life in fear. I love my
reckless brother, as much as he hurts my heart. I

1500
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,824
love you for that, and don't be afraid to be
that.

1501
01:33:54,824 --> 01:34:00,172
LIAM: I have no clever answer to give you.

1502
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:05,298
LAURA: That's wonderful. I love you. And I walk
away!

1503
01:34:05,298 --> 01:34:09,220
(laughter)

1504
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:13,426
LIAM: I go to bed.

1505
01:34:13,426 --> 01:34:19,411
TALIESIN: Before Scanlan disappears, I grab him as
he's leaving.

1506
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:22,417
SAM: I'm just making the rounds, make sure
everyone's tucked in for the night.

1507
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:24,921
LIAM: Scanlan's like, wasn't looking in on Pike.
Wasn't looking in on Pike.

1508
01:34:24,921 --> 01:34:33,263
TALIESIN: Have you, perhaps, installed some sort
of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for

1509
01:34:33,263 --> 01:34:35,999
me? I've got a few little projects I want to poke
at.

1510
01:34:35,999 --> 01:34:37,428
SAM: You mean the all-purpose room?

1511
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:40,219
LAURA: The Room of Requirement?

1512
01:34:40,219 --> 01:34:45,735
TALIESIN: I'm a little worried by what all-purpose
necessarily means.

1513
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:48,407
SAM: Don't look in there with a black light.

1514
01:34:48,407 --> 01:34:59,439
TALIESIN: It's not really a work table, is it?

1515
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:01,417
LIAM: It is the danger room.

1516
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:11,915
SAM: It's all purposes, Percy. All purposes. But
yes, it is a private room. No one can hear you

1517
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:22,403
scream in there. It's the farthest wing we have. I
can give you some servants to help you set

1518
01:35:22,403 --> 01:35:27,918
something up, bring in some tables, whatever. We
don't have much in here, we're not prepared for

1519
01:35:27,918 --> 01:35:30,200
chemical reactions.

1520
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,979
TALIESIN: Nothing complicated, just some very
basic blacksmithing and a little bit of

1521
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:33,871
leatherwork.

1522
01:35:33,871 --> 01:35:35,625
SAM: Do I have that stuff? Anything to help him?

1523
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:37,995
MATT: Yeah. If it was prepared within the house.

1524
01:35:37,995 --> 01:35:42,560
SAM: I tried to make enough stuff for all of us to
have our basic needs met.

1525
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,572
TALIESIN: I can think of some very sexy things
that can be done with an anvil. Think about it.

1526
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:48,946
SAM: All my anvils are gnome-sized.

1527
01:35:48,946 --> 01:35:51,409
TALIESIN: That's comical.

1528
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:57,263
MARISHA: Keyleth pops her head out into the
hallway. Did I hear something about working? Are

1529
01:35:57,263 --> 01:35:58,219
you working?

1530
01:35:58,219 --> 01:36:01,803
TALIESIN: Yes. Scanlan's helping me find a room
that apparently is so sound-proof we don't

1531
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:03,990
actually have to hear anyone else's drama.

1532
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,085
MARISHA: Oh, that's fantastic.

1533
01:36:05,085 --> 01:36:06,302
TALIESIN: I know. Grab a book. It'll be fun.

1534
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,347
MARISHA: I might join you.

1535
01:36:07,347 --> 01:36:08,876
SAM: Are you going to have a working dinner? I'll
send some chickens down.

1536
01:36:08,876 --> 01:36:10,392
MARISHA: I can't sleep, so, yes.

1537
01:36:10,392 --> 01:36:12,500
TRAVIS: What about cows?

1538
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,220
TALIESIN: No cows in my room either, please.

1539
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,192
MARISHA: I join Percy and help him.

1540
01:36:17,192 --> 01:36:22,334
MATT: Okay. You guys find the all-purpose room,
which does have the basics required for smithing.

1541
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:27,504
The smithing gear that is brought to you by the
servants in itself is very, very finely crafted

1542
01:36:27,504 --> 01:36:33,011
and nearly weightless. It's really impressive, and
you look at the label, and it has a small timer on

1543
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:35,495
it before it becomes immaterial.

1544
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:41,841
TALIESIN: I can work with materials that are in
the Bag of Holding, that are real materials, as

1545
01:36:41,841 --> 01:36:44,824
long as I put them back in the Bag of Holding and
take them with me? I can't leave anything,

1546
01:36:44,824 --> 01:36:45,790
obviously.

1547
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:47,290
MATT: Yeah. Anything you leave in here will just
be spat out.

1548
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:49,455
TALIESIN: Oh, it'll just be spat out. That's
lovely.

1549
01:36:49,455 --> 01:36:51,472
MATT: Yeah, onto the ground where it was.

1550
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:55,910
TALIESIN: For the moment, because I don't have
everything I need for the broom yet, I want to

1551
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,413
work on a piece of jewelry, if that's okay. I want
to work on the thing.

1552
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:00,979
MATT: Work on jewelry?

1553
01:37:00,979 --> 01:37:04,085
TALIESIN: I want to construct a little piece of
jewelry if that's okay. Not magical.

1554
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:05,236
MATT: Do you have a jeweler's kit?

1555
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,954
TALIESIN: Do I have a jeweler's kit?

1556
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:09,253
MATT: It's a whole different skill set, man.

1557
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:11,001
TALIESIN: I can't tinker something?

1558
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:14,237
MATT: You can tinker something, but jewelry is
different from tinkering.

1559
01:37:14,237 --> 01:37:19,536
TALIESIN: No, well, this is a piece that has
purpose. It actually is going to be a functional

1560
01:37:19,536 --> 01:37:20,629
object.

1561
01:37:20,629 --> 01:37:22,926
MATT: What is the function of this object? You
need to tell me these things.

1562
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,564
TALIESIN: I know. This is something that I-- I'm
so sorry.

1563
01:37:24,564 --> 01:37:26,959
MATT: I'm going to make something! Make me roll
for it! I got to know what you're doing.

1564
01:37:26,959 --> 01:37:33,187
TALIESIN: I want to make a-- I'm so sorry, I'm
losing the word.

1565
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:35,580
MARISHA: Hey, Percy, what are you trying to make?

1566
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:42,755
TALIESIN: Something that's too complicated to
explain to you. I'm blanking on it. I may have to

1567
01:37:42,755 --> 01:37:50,466
just give you the name at the break. A little herb
pouch, like one of those cages that close up to

1568
01:37:50,466 --> 01:37:52,052
put herbs in them?

1569
01:37:52,052 --> 01:37:53,682
SAM: Oh, like you make tea with?

1570
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:57,943
MATT: Okay. It won't be pretty, but you can make
it functional. Yeah, go ahead and make

1571
01:37:57,943 --> 01:37:59,280
a tinkering check.

1572
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,770
TALIESIN: All right, I'll make it pretty later.

1573
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:03,086
LIAM: Like a Shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in
it?

1574
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:06,938
MATT: This will be a dexterity mod, because it's
not a very complicated piece based on what you've

1575
01:38:06,938 --> 01:38:09,667
constructed in the past. It's more about your
ability to make it work.

1576
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:16,085
TALIESIN: Dexterity? Thank god, because that's a
terrible roll. 14.

1577
01:38:16,085 --> 01:38:18,284
MATT: 14. Okay, it takes you the better part of
the night.

1578
01:38:18,284 --> 01:38:19,654
MARISHA: Do I assist him at all?

1579
01:38:19,654 --> 01:38:24,507
MATT: With a job this small, there's not a whole
lot you can assist with except handing him tools.

1580
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:27,556
TALIESIN: I'm not going to run the whole night. At
some point I'm going to be like, I don't have the

1581
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:33,125
design yet. This is something I want to get right,
so this is going to be working towards it.

1582
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,309
MATT: Okay, so you get the first stage of that set
and ready to go.

1583
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:38,576
TALIESIN: I can't think of the name of what it is.
I'm so embarrassed.

1584
01:38:38,576 --> 01:38:44,255
MATT: You all eventually find yourselves to rest,
tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted

1585
01:38:44,255 --> 01:38:49,956
to, conversations finished. You find yourselves at
breakfast, a delightful spread of breakfast

1586
01:38:49,956 --> 01:38:53,009
chickens prepared for you.

1587
01:38:53,009 --> 01:38:57,962
MARISHA: I pick one up off the table and I say,
hey Vex! (whoosh)

1588
01:38:57,962 --> 01:39:00,786
LAURA: Shit! I'm not even on my-- (grunt)

1589
01:39:00,786 --> 01:39:08,359
MATT: All of you duck instinctively as the chicken
has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down

1590
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:12,643
before she gets her arrow out, and you see her
aiming downward as it falls. As she releases the

1591
01:39:12,643 --> 01:39:18,519
arrow, it manages to catch it. Go ahead and roll
for an attack, see how well it hits.

1592
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:21,084
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 30?

1593
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:22,559
MATT: (arrow impact)

1594
01:39:22,559 --> 01:39:24,023
LAURA: Oh, wait, 28, 28.

1595
01:39:24,023 --> 01:39:26,892
MATT: (slightly quieter arrow impact)

1596
01:39:26,892 --> 01:39:33,718
It pins the chicken to the wall, and then it just
sags. The wooden shaft slowly snaps under the

1597
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,051
weight of the chicken before it hits the ground.
One of the servants scoops it up and sets it back

1598
01:39:38,051 --> 01:39:41,756
on the table in front of Keyleth with the broken
arrow shaft sticking out.

1599
01:39:41,756 --> 01:39:47,236
MARISHA: I like that game. It's my new favorite
game.

1600
01:39:47,236 --> 01:39:50,090
LIAM: Do you want some more broom target
practice?

1601
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:52,004
LAURA: I need to practice with this broom.

1602
01:39:52,004 --> 01:39:53,534
LIAM: You do need to practice, seriously.

1603
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:55,287
MARISHA: We have more chickens.

1604
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:56,405
TRAVIS: We've got stuff to do.

1605
01:39:56,405 --> 01:39:57,793
LAURA: Yeah, we have stuff to do.

1606
01:39:57,793 --> 01:40:02,054
LIAM: I'm still eating. I would love to see you,
for five minutes, get up on that broom and fly

1607
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:04,197
around and fucking put some arrows in some
chickens.

1608
01:40:04,197 --> 01:40:10,601
LAURA: All right, fine, I'll fucking practice.
Does it help me at all to practice on this broom?

1609
01:40:10,601 --> 01:40:12,191
LIAM: It helps me.

1610
01:40:12,191 --> 01:40:18,605
SAM: I will command seven servants to each have a
loaded chicken at the ready.

1611
01:40:18,605 --> 01:40:19,697
LIAM: Pull!

1612
01:40:19,697 --> 01:40:21,388
LAURA: I start flying.

1613
01:40:21,388 --> 01:40:24,018
SAM: Vax, you can do the honors and say the
pulls.

1614
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,673
LAURA: I clench really hard with my thighs to try
to hold on to this broom.

1615
01:40:27,673 --> 01:40:31,949
MATT: As the rest of you enjoy what is the
strangest of Medieval Times experiences you've

1616
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:41,834
had, glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this
dining room area, you watch Vex spiral around on

1617
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:44,561
her broom before, Scanlan?

1618
01:40:44,561 --> 01:40:46,654
SAM: Vax is saying pull.

1619
01:40:46,654 --> 01:40:47,613
LIAM: Pull!

1620
01:40:47,613 --> 01:40:48,904
TALIESIN: (chicken clucking)

1621
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:51,665
MATT: Roll, with disadvantage.

1622
01:40:51,665 --> 01:40:53,799
LAURA: Oh, Jesus. Okay.

1623
01:40:53,799 --> 01:40:58,594
TRAVIS: Say it. Say it!

1624
01:40:58,594 --> 01:40:59,620
LAURA: One!

1625
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,381
TALIESIN: Easiest number to count to.

1626
01:41:01,381 --> 01:41:07,163
MATT: So as the first chicken goes in the air, she
reaches and goes to aim. However, she catches

1627
01:41:07,163 --> 01:41:13,757
herself. The broom throws her off, and she stops
just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the

1628
01:41:13,757 --> 01:41:19,083
chicken, not realizing where the chicken had now
fallen past. Releases it. Scanlan, I want you to

1629
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:22,333
make a dexterity saving throw.

1630
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:26,920
SAM: Nine.

1631
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,147
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

1632
01:41:30,147 --> 01:41:35,475
LAURA: Okay, that's not that bad. Damage? Oh, it's
automatic hit?

1633
01:41:35,475 --> 01:41:36,694
MATT: Yeah.

1634
01:41:36,694 --> 01:41:38,914
LAURA: Okay. Oh, no.

1635
01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:40,632
LIAM: Full damage.

1636
01:41:40,632 --> 01:41:44,023
LAURA: That's 17.

1637
01:41:44,023 --> 01:41:52,299
MATT: So, Scanlan, as you're watching this,
chewing, suddenly, (impact).

1638
01:41:52,299 --> 01:41:56,674
SAM: (screaming)

1639
01:41:56,674 --> 01:42:04,724
LAURA: Shit! Scanlan, Scanlan, I'm so sorry! I
land, I land. I land and I instantly cast Cure

1640
01:42:04,724 --> 01:42:09,459
Wounds on him. Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry.

1641
01:42:09,459 --> 01:42:13,565
MATT: A big old chicken dangling at the end of the
arrow.

1642
01:42:13,565 --> 01:42:16,472
LAURA: Pike! Pike, help, help, help, help!

1643
01:42:16,472 --> 01:42:28,091
TRAVIS: I'm just applauding. Again! Again! I pick
up my chicken and I throw it at Scanlan.

1644
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:32,197
TALIESIN: Does this mean when the night's over
there's going to be a little pool of blood where

1645
01:42:32,197 --> 01:42:33,949
the door was?

1646
01:42:33,949 --> 01:42:41,100
MATT: You'll find out. Go ahead and roll for
healing.

1647
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,760
LAURA: Oh, God, okay.

1648
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:47,596
MATT: As Vex reaches out and grasps you and
manages to heal some of your wounds.

1649
01:42:47,596 --> 01:42:52,866
LAURA: Oh, good, that's good. It's just 1d8, do I
add anything?

1650
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,654
MATT: 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

1651
01:42:54,654 --> 01:42:59,122
LAURA: 11.

1652
01:42:59,122 --> 01:43:00,918
MATT: So you heal 11 hit points.

1653
01:43:00,918 --> 01:43:02,507
SAM: Can I pull out the arrow?

1654
01:43:02,507 --> 01:43:06,702
MATT: Sure. A gout of blood sprays out.

1655
01:43:06,702 --> 01:43:09,331
LAURA: I hold my hand there. Pike, can you help?

1656
01:43:09,331 --> 01:43:13,503
ASHLEY: I'll help, I'll help. That broom is
amazing!

1657
01:43:13,503 --> 01:43:16,701
MARISHA: Isn't it, Pike?

1658
01:43:16,701 --> 01:43:26,057
ASHLEY: Yes! And there are too many chickens in
here, anyway. Healing Scanlan.

1659
01:43:26,057 --> 01:43:29,870
MATT: Pike, you're just casting a Cure Wounds?

1660
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:32,128
ASHLEY: Yes, I'll cast Cure Wounds.

1661
01:43:32,128 --> 01:43:39,897
MATT: The wound closes as Pike reaches out and,
with a small chuckle, heals how many hit points?

1662
01:43:39,897 --> 01:43:42,839
LIAM: The chicken comes back to life!

1663
01:43:42,839 --> 01:43:46,000
ASHLEY: What did you say, Matt?

1664
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,337
MATT: How much do you heal? Roll 1d8 plus five,
I'm pretty sure. That was amazing.

1665
01:43:52,337 --> 01:43:56,789
LAURA: Sorry, Scanlan. You can blame my brother.

1666
01:43:56,789 --> 01:43:58,031
ASHLEY: Nine.

1667
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,178
SAM: I'm back.

1668
01:43:59,178 --> 01:44:02,896
MATT: You're back to full. The wounds close.
Pike's there holding her hands on your shoulders,

1669
01:44:02,896 --> 01:44:04,159
closing the wound.

1670
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,652
SAM: Thank you, Pike.

1671
01:44:05,652 --> 01:44:07,776
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

1672
01:44:07,776 --> 01:44:13,258
SAM: All right. Well, let's say breakfast is
over.

1673
01:44:13,258 --> 01:44:18,304
LAURA: I'm going to practice a bit more, you
guys.

1674
01:44:18,304 --> 01:44:21,056
MATT: The other servants are holding their
chickens at the ready.

1675
01:44:21,056 --> 01:44:22,284
SAM: Pull.

1676
01:44:22,284 --> 01:44:24,413
MARISHA: Go, go, go!

1677
01:44:24,413 --> 01:44:28,437
ASHLEY: Can I try punching one in the air with my
new gauntlets?

1678
01:44:28,437 --> 01:44:33,495
MATT: Okay. As he's about to throw it up, Pike
runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and

1679
01:44:33,495 --> 01:44:41,429
(boom) punches it in the air. Pike, roll a
strength check. Roll a d20 and add plus four to it.

1680
01:44:41,429 --> 01:44:44,274
LIAM: 20 chicken McNuggets fly through the air.

1681
01:44:44,274 --> 01:44:50,204
ASHLEY: This is so dumb, why am I doing this? What
am I doing?

1682
01:44:50,204 --> 01:44:51,896
MATT: Roll a d20, add four to it.

1683
01:44:51,896 --> 01:44:53,998
LIAM: For the greater good.

1684
01:44:53,998 --> 01:44:57,686
ASHLEY: Okay, it's not that high. 11.

1685
01:44:57,686 --> 01:45:06,621
MATT: 11, okay. You (boom) bat it up with a Pike
punch. We'll say for the sake of brevity on this,

1686
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:11,130
go ahead and roll one more attack, and this will
count for the rest of the shots. With

1687
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:12,735
disadvantage.

1688
01:45:12,735 --> 01:45:14,288
LAURA: Oh, come on. 16.

1689
01:45:14,288 --> 01:45:20,513
MATT: 16, okay. You do manage to recover your
sense of self-esteem as you manage to pin a couple

1690
01:45:20,513 --> 01:45:26,176
more chickens against the walls and the table in
here, but each arrow is just a reminder of the one

1691
01:45:26,176 --> 01:45:28,466
stray that began this whole breakfast excursion.

1692
01:45:28,466 --> 01:45:30,489
LAURA: Sorry about that, Scanlan.

1693
01:45:30,489 --> 01:45:32,146
SAM: Great job, Vex.

1694
01:45:32,146 --> 01:45:34,874
MARISHA: Guys, this is the best brunch we've ever
done.

1695
01:45:34,874 --> 01:45:36,723
LIAM: I will never forget it.

1696
01:45:36,723 --> 01:45:39,203
MARISHA: That was great. Thank you for that,
Scanlan.

1697
01:45:39,203 --> 01:45:40,235
SAM: Sure, sure.

1698
01:45:40,235 --> 01:45:42,323
LAURA: We should probably get a start on a walk.

1699
01:45:42,323 --> 01:45:44,471
MARISHA: Yeah, so, question, before we leave, you
guys--

1700
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:47,807
TALIESIN: This is going to make the archery booth
at Renn Faire hilarious. Sorry, okay. Carry on.

1701
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:53,821
MARISHA: Do we want to travel via Wind Walk, or
are we okay?

1702
01:45:53,821 --> 01:45:55,500
SAM: We're only eight hours away?

1703
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,961
TALIESIN: It's only eight hours. Save your
strength.

1704
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:58,496
MARISHA: Because I can save my strength.

1705
01:45:58,496 --> 01:45:59,716
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, save it.

1706
01:45:59,716 --> 01:46:01,049
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Thank you.

1707
01:46:01,049 --> 01:46:03,006
LAURA: We might come across some orcs.

1708
01:46:03,006 --> 01:46:04,178
MARISHA: That's true.

1709
01:46:04,178 --> 01:46:05,466
TRAVIS: Hopefully. Shit.

1710
01:46:05,466 --> 01:46:07,432
LAURA: I know, right? I could use some.

1711
01:46:07,432 --> 01:46:08,831
SAM: All right, let's set out.

1712
01:46:08,831 --> 01:46:14,807
MATT: You guys say good-bye to your servants,
gather yourselves as you step out and the door

1713
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:20,681
closes behind you. Do you choose to leave the
spell up, or are you going to fade it as you walk along?

1714
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:23,203
SAM: If I leave it up, can anyone go in there?

1715
01:46:23,203 --> 01:46:24,983
MATT: Anyone that you allow into it.

1716
01:46:24,983 --> 01:46:27,931
TALIESIN: I want to see if the blood comes out.

1717
01:46:27,931 --> 01:46:30,959
SAM: No, I'll shut the door and hide the key under
a rock.

1718
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:40,781
MATT: Okay. You guys continue walking southward
towards the Frostweald. About another seven to

1719
01:46:40,781 --> 01:46:45,640
eight hours of travel along that way, you begin to
see the Stormcrest Mountains in the distance get

1720
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:50,309
closer and loom larger and larger, and you get the
feel of the Stormcrest Mountains especially

1721
01:46:50,309 --> 01:46:59,225
because there is a very large storm surge that
seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it

1722
01:46:59,225 --> 01:47:03,105
that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm that's
blasting through. You can't see the peaks of the

1723
01:47:03,105 --> 01:47:09,283
mountains from this distance. There are clusters
of trees and forest areas along, but ahead of you,

1724
01:47:09,283 --> 01:47:15,828
you can see, coated in a very, very bright,
visibly white forest, this is the Frostweald

1725
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:21,488
itself, with snowfall. Once again, you've been
here before, and there is an essence, and you

1726
01:47:21,488 --> 01:47:26,757
don't recall the specific reason for it, but there
is a purpose, an ancient purpose, as to why this

1727
01:47:26,757 --> 01:47:32,810
one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of
winter. Amongst what is a relatively temperate, in

1728
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:39,622
some places almost tropical temperature layer, it
is very strange, and part of the mystical calling

1729
01:47:39,622 --> 01:47:46,680
to the Frostweald is that it is perpetually locked
in a winter state. You-- don't worry, I'm working

1730
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:48,113
on it.

1731
01:47:48,113 --> 01:47:55,201
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a second to meditate on the
previous time that we were here in the Frostweald,

1732
01:47:55,201 --> 01:48:05,081
and I cast Find the Path. 6th-level spell. Which
gives me the most direct, shortest route as long

1733
01:48:05,081 --> 01:48:11,086
as I'm on the same plane existence of where I'm
going, if I have a vague idea of where I'm going.

1734
01:48:11,086 --> 01:48:14,167
MATT: Where are you going?

1735
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:19,828
SAM: We're going to the Stormcrest Mountains,
right?

1736
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:25,114
MARISHA: We're trying to get to the Stormcrest
Mountains through, but we're also looking for the

1737
01:48:25,114 --> 01:48:27,614
band of orcs travelling.

1738
01:48:27,614 --> 01:48:34,410
MATT: If you name a destination on another plane
of existence, a destination that moves, or a

1739
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:38,630
destination that isn't specific, such as a green
dragon's lair, the spell fails.

1740
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:42,409
MARISHA: But we're in the Frostweald, right?

1741
01:48:42,409 --> 01:48:44,364
MATT: Yes. You're approaching it now.

1742
01:48:44,364 --> 01:48:48,205
MARISHA: Is the Frostweald considered on a
different plane?

1743
01:48:48,205 --> 01:48:52,906
MATT: No. But do you have a specific location that
you're familiar with that you want to go to?

1744
01:48:52,906 --> 01:48:56,217
MARISHA: Well, I can find us the shortest, most
direct route to the Stormcrest Mountains.

1745
01:48:56,217 --> 01:48:58,208
SAM: Have we been there?

1746
01:48:58,208 --> 01:49:05,108
MATT: Yeah, you can see them. I'm trying to figure
out. For the spell to work, you have to choose a

1747
01:49:05,108 --> 01:49:07,788
specific location that you're already familiar
with to lead you to it.

1748
01:49:07,788 --> 01:49:09,291
MARISHA: Right.

1749
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:10,297
MATT: So what are you saying?

1750
01:49:10,297 --> 01:49:13,475
MARISHA: Stormcrest Mountains. But just because I
can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going

1751
01:49:13,475 --> 01:49:16,654
to find the most direct path, shortest direct path
towards it.

1752
01:49:16,654 --> 01:49:17,681
MATT: That's true.

1753
01:49:17,681 --> 01:49:20,326
MARISHA: Right? Or is this a waste of a spell
and I should just do something else?

1754
01:49:20,326 --> 01:49:32,878
MATT: I will give you the benefit to say that you
can see the mountain range. This is more useful if

1755
01:49:32,878 --> 01:49:36,738
it's trying to find a place that you're very
familiar with, seen a picture of, or you had a

1756
01:49:36,738 --> 01:49:40,610
very specific bit of information for it. For a
general location or a location that you're unaware

1757
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:42,017
of, the spell wouldn't have an effect.

1758
01:49:42,017 --> 01:49:46,642
LAURA: Maybe you could think of the location of
her mate, the sphinx's mate.

1759
01:49:46,642 --> 01:49:51,997
MARISHA: I don't know it, so it fails. That's why
I was trying to do Stormcrest Mountains, but

1760
01:49:51,997 --> 01:49:53,570
apparently that's not specific enough.

1761
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:57,398
LAURA: Well, is it specific? It's just we can
see them.

1762
01:49:57,398 --> 01:49:59,506
LIAM: Yeah, it's right there.

1763
01:49:59,506 --> 01:50:01,089
MATT: It's a large range that's very visible.

1764
01:50:01,089 --> 01:50:02,435
LIAM: Let's move on, let's move on.

1765
01:50:02,435 --> 01:50:03,642
MARISHA: I'll do something else.

1766
01:50:03,642 --> 01:50:05,395
TALIESIN: Save it for something special.

1767
01:50:05,395 --> 01:50:12,343
MATT: So as you guys press forward to the outside
of the Frostweald, the snow- and ice-covered

1768
01:50:12,343 --> 01:50:15,955
treeline is a very familiar sight from your last
time traveling here. There are canopies of

1769
01:50:15,955 --> 01:50:22,276
pine-like trees that interlock with windless
snowfall, that leave a fairly dark interior set

1770
01:50:22,276 --> 01:50:31,679
from the frozen-over canopy. Slick surfaces and
knee-deep snowbanks permeate this entire forest

1771
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:37,408
region. Your breath is immediately visible as you
step past that threshold, and the temperature

1772
01:50:37,408 --> 01:50:41,673
drops about 40 degrees from what it was before,
getting steadily colder the further in you travel.

1773
01:50:41,673 --> 01:50:48,891
LAURA: Bet you're glad you have that beard now,
huh? Keeps you warm? No?

1774
01:50:48,891 --> 01:50:52,960
TRAVIS: It's actually quite nice out here. This is
like spring for me.

1775
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:57,684
LIAM: Are your people-- Did you grow up in the
cold?

1776
01:50:57,684 --> 01:50:59,132
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're pretty cool.

1777
01:50:59,132 --> 01:51:01,591
LIAM: Wow.

1778
01:51:01,591 --> 01:51:09,387
MATT: Pressing in, as the temperature drops
further and further, you occasionally come across

1779
01:51:09,387 --> 01:51:16,172
a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate
aspects, different places in the canopy, and even

1780
01:51:16,172 --> 01:51:22,502
stepping into those, they don't lend any change in
temperature or warmth. The enchantment that

1781
01:51:22,502 --> 01:51:31,462
surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be
moved by such natural incursions. Everyone go

1782
01:51:31,462 --> 01:51:34,709
ahead and roll a perception check.

1783
01:51:34,709 --> 01:51:50,505
LAURA: 25. Are we in the woods? 29.

1784
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:51,742
TRAVIS: Two.

1785
01:51:51,742 --> 01:51:52,936
MARISHA: 18.

1786
01:51:52,936 --> 01:51:54,097
TALIESIN: 15.

1787
01:51:54,097 --> 01:51:55,052
SAM: 20.

1788
01:51:55,052 --> 01:51:57,314
ASHLEY: 25.

1789
01:51:57,314 --> 01:52:02,843
MATT: As you guys are walking through, keeping
your eyes peeled, Vax, you're so lost in thought

1790
01:52:02,843 --> 01:52:13,130
that your eyes glaze over for a second and you
forget where you are. Pike and Vex, the two of you

1791
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:17,623
get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group,
pushing through the snow. You come around from a

1792
01:52:17,623 --> 01:52:23,568
tree and you can see, this is about an hour or so
into your entrance to the Frostweald, you see a

1793
01:52:23,568 --> 01:52:33,065
small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of
the heavy canopy, and what appears to be a couple

1794
01:52:33,065 --> 01:52:41,589
of small stone ruins and a single obelisk, a
monolith-like pillar of stone that juts out of the

1795
01:52:41,589 --> 01:52:46,983
snow. It's about 200 feet away from you guys, 250
feet.

1796
01:52:46,983 --> 01:52:50,939
LAURA: Can we see anything around it? Any people,
any trace of tracks in the snow?

1797
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:56,175
MATT: From this distance, no. You don't see any,
there are no figures, there is no movement. There

1798
01:52:56,175 --> 01:53:03,477
is just that stone piece that, at a slight angle,
stands out amongst the rest of the treeline.

1799
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:05,570
TRAVIS: What do you see?

1800
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:11,370
LAURA: There's a, look. There's a fucking obelisk.
It's a tall stone thing, Grog.

1801
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:14,076
TRAVIS: Yeah? So?

1802
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:15,355
SAM: Let's go over.

1803
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:16,543
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1804
01:53:16,543 --> 01:53:21,442
TALIESIN: Vex, you and I should hang back, but
we'll let everyone else.

1805
01:53:21,442 --> 01:53:25,790
MARISHA: It's a big obelisk? Are there any birds
or anything like that around?

1806
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:32,583
MATT: Listening, that's what's interesting.
Usually forests, because they're teeming with so

1807
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:39,140
much life, there's a perpetual sound of things
that live amongst the boughs and the treeline.

1808
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:45,499
Because it's so cold here, it's eerily silent.
Every footfall that hits the snow, you can hear

1809
01:53:45,499 --> 01:53:51,959
the crunch resounding and echoing through the
nearby vicinity. It is just a still, silent

1810
01:53:51,959 --> 01:53:53,862
atmosphere in this forest.

1811
01:53:53,862 --> 01:53:56,013
LAURA: (clanging) Pike!

1812
01:53:56,013 --> 01:54:00,548
TRAVIS: Let me check if it's safe to move on. And
I reach down and scoop up a handful of snow,

1813
01:54:00,548 --> 01:54:04,683
right? Just snow? How's it taste?

1814
01:54:04,683 --> 01:54:07,738
MATT: It's the clearest snow you've tasted in a
long time.

1815
01:54:07,738 --> 01:54:10,006
TRAVIS: Shit's crazy pure, yo.

1816
01:54:10,006 --> 01:54:13,094
SAM: So then we're safe to move ahead?

1817
01:54:13,094 --> 01:54:16,085
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're good. Let's go check out the
scary obelisk.

1818
01:54:16,085 --> 01:54:18,843
LIAM: Everybody starts inhaling snow.

1819
01:54:18,843 --> 01:54:22,076
MATT: Are you moving ahead, Grog?

1820
01:54:22,076 --> 01:54:25,048
TRAVIS: I'm moving ahead. Who wants to come with
me to the obelisk?

1821
01:54:25,048 --> 01:54:26,934
LAURA: I'm going to hide behind a tree and watch.

1822
01:54:26,934 --> 01:54:28,189
LIAM: To the what? What obelisk?

1823
01:54:28,189 --> 01:54:30,155
TRAVIS: For what? Why are you hiding?

1824
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:31,794
LAURA: I'm just going to keep guard!

1825
01:54:31,794 --> 01:54:33,171
MARISHA: I'll come with you, Grog.

1826
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:34,711
TRAVIS: There's nobody out here.

1827
01:54:34,711 --> 01:54:37,287
TALIESIN: I've had bad luck touching things
lately. I'm letting other people touch things.

1828
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:38,420
MATT: Grog, Keyleth.

1829
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,470
SAM: Pike's coming.

1830
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:48,331
MATT: So Grog, Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan are all
going forward. Looks like Vex, Vax, and Percy are

1831
01:54:48,331 --> 01:54:49,255
staying.

1832
01:54:49,255 --> 01:54:52,663
TALIESIN: I'm getting another angle so that we
have two different vantage points of what may

1833
01:54:52,663 --> 01:54:53,692
happen.

1834
01:54:53,692 --> 01:54:56,407
LAURA: Getting a little closer, but keeping.

1835
01:54:56,407 --> 01:54:58,079
MATT: Are you going with Percy?

1836
01:54:58,079 --> 01:54:59,795
LIAM: I'm brainfarting, so I'm just following
Percy.

1837
01:54:59,795 --> 01:55:03,590
MATT: Okay. Percy and Vax splinter off to the
left, Vex you go ahead and take the right, and you

1838
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:07,698
head around this clearing while the rest of you
walk into the center of it.

1839
01:55:07,698 --> 01:55:09,574
TALIESIN: We're keeping an eye on that thing in
the--

1840
01:55:09,574 --> 01:55:11,956
LIAM: Look at that!

1841
01:55:11,956 --> 01:55:14,538
TALIESIN: I know, it's a thing. We're going to let
Grog touch it and see what happens.

1842
01:55:14,538 --> 01:55:20,584
MATT: You guys approach, and as you're stepping
through the snowfall, which right now is, for you,

1843
01:55:20,584 --> 01:55:27,871
up to just past your knees, like the grass was.
For Keyleth it's just up to your waist. Scanlan,

1844
01:55:27,871 --> 01:55:33,701
you and Pike are both (grunting) like the dogs
jumping through the snow that vanish with each

1845
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:37,522
leap as you're having to find your way through
this heavy snowfall.

1846
01:55:37,522 --> 01:55:39,392
TRAVIS: Do you guys want a ride?

1847
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,420
SAM: Yes, please.

1848
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:42,241
TRAVIS: I pick up each gnome on my shoulders.

1849
01:55:42,241 --> 01:55:44,873
ASHLEY: Thanks, Grog!

1850
01:55:44,873 --> 01:55:45,996
TRAVIS: No problem!

1851
01:55:45,996 --> 01:55:52,911
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check as
you guys approach this obelisk.

1852
01:55:52,911 --> 01:55:56,736
SAM: 25.

1853
01:55:56,736 --> 01:56:05,249
TRAVIS: It's a two, minus three.

1854
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:07,419
MARISHA: 11.

1855
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:11,352
MATT: What did you get, Pike?

1856
01:56:11,352 --> 01:56:12,659
ASHLEY: 14.

1857
01:56:12,659 --> 01:56:17,912
MATT: 14, okay. So as you guys approach, from this
vantage point, it's carved, definitely, and the

1858
01:56:17,912 --> 01:56:25,071
carving is very old. Weathered somewhat, but not
too heavily, so it's either not very old or

1859
01:56:25,071 --> 01:56:27,900
there's not a whole lot of weather that comes
through here, and by the stillness of the wind

1860
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:31,296
since you've entered, you get the feeling
that's probably more the case. It's hard to gauge

1861
01:56:31,296 --> 01:56:37,612
how old or how long it's been here. But there are
various carvings amongst it. There is a big

1862
01:56:37,612 --> 01:56:41,007
symbol. I want to have you guys roll a religion
check real fast.

1863
01:56:41,007 --> 01:56:47,229
TRAVIS: Awesome. What the fuck. Natural one.

1864
01:56:47,229 --> 01:56:49,722
LAURA: You need to not use that dice right now.

1865
01:56:49,722 --> 01:56:51,136
SAM: 12.

1866
01:56:51,136 --> 01:56:54,524
MARISHA: Religion? Nine.

1867
01:56:54,524 --> 01:56:56,089
MATT: Pike?

1868
01:56:56,089 --> 01:56:57,722
ASHLEY: 15.

1869
01:56:57,722 --> 01:57:03,524
MATT: 15, okay. It looks familiar, but you're
having a hard time really getting the essence.

1870
01:57:03,524 --> 01:57:12,435
Pike, you recognize this. This is not the largely
understood or most commonly utilized symbol of

1871
01:57:12,435 --> 01:57:21,478
Ioun, but it is a very ancient, the basis of the
religion of Ioun, which is the same goddess of

1872
01:57:21,478 --> 01:57:27,872
knowledge that Osysa was overseeing the temple
beneath.

1873
01:57:27,872 --> 01:57:30,412
ASHLEY: Wait, how do you spell it?

1874
01:57:30,412 --> 01:57:37,819
MATT: Ioun. I-O-U-N. You actually carry a stone,
enchanted with the essence of Ioun's knowledge.

1875
01:57:37,819 --> 01:57:40,150
SAM: Oh, that's my Ion Stone! Ioun Stone!

1876
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:42,740
TRAVIS: Is it made of, it's stone?

1877
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:47,049
MATT: It's solid, solid stone, and goes up about
35 feet or so.

1878
01:57:47,049 --> 01:57:51,150
TRAVIS: Hey, Scanlan, I heard if you touch your
tongue to something like this, it'll stick.

1879
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:55,989
SAM: Wow. Wow, we should probably try that out.
Keyleth?

1880
01:57:55,989 --> 01:57:57,220
MARISHA: What?

1881
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:59,191
SAM: Can you go lick that obelisk?

1882
01:57:59,191 --> 01:58:00,752
MARISHA: Hell no.

1883
01:58:00,752 --> 01:58:02,095
TRAVIS: Why not?

1884
01:58:02,095 --> 01:58:08,714
MARISHA: I know that one. But you should do it,
Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven

1885
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:14,186
abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the
same way. But you should try it, it's crazy.

1886
01:58:14,186 --> 01:58:16,620
TALIESIN: Keyleth, that was very clever.

1887
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,055
SAM: How far are we?

1888
01:58:18,055 --> 01:58:19,709
MATT: You guys are about ten feet from it.

1889
01:58:19,709 --> 01:58:23,059
SAM: I'm going to just look around it for any
traps.

1890
01:58:23,059 --> 01:58:25,560
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

1891
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,928
SAM: 18.

1892
01:58:27,928 --> 01:58:34,573
MATT: 18, okay. You have to leap off Grog and
start wading through. You're finding pieces of

1893
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:42,077
broken stone, smaller chunks about that big and
bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the

1894
01:58:42,077 --> 01:58:49,761
snow. You push around, because you see the ruined
walls around. You do find a larger piece of stone

1895
01:58:49,761 --> 01:58:54,500
that looks like a broken statue, like there must
have been some sort of a statue here that had lost

1896
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,233
the hand, and it's stumbled there on the ground.

1897
01:58:57,233 --> 01:59:05,608
MARISHA: Upon him seeing that, I pull out my Hunk
of Quall and see if it lights up.

1898
01:59:05,608 --> 01:59:08,304
SAM: Oh, you have to concentrate on it.

1899
01:59:08,304 --> 01:59:09,806
TALIESIN: Are there orcs present?

1900
01:59:09,806 --> 01:59:11,502
MATT: (laughs)

1901
01:59:11,502 --> 01:59:13,312
TALIESIN: I knew someone would laugh at that.

1902
01:59:13,312 --> 01:59:23,430
MATT: You hold it aloft. It has a small vibration
of energy, as part of the crystal sliver itself,

1903
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:25,499
but it doesn't seem to change in the environment.

1904
01:59:25,499 --> 01:59:30,589
MARISHA: Can I move a little bit closer to the
obelisk?

1905
01:59:30,589 --> 01:59:35,337
MATT: As you're stepping closer to the obelisk,
you also notice there is some writing or some sort

1906
01:59:35,337 --> 01:59:39,513
of scripture that is carved towards the base, that
is partially buried by the snow that has gathered

1907
01:59:39,513 --> 01:59:46,382
at its base. You find more pieces of statues.
Arms, part of a torso, like somebody had knocked

1908
01:59:46,382 --> 01:59:51,214
over a series of statues. A lot of them have deep
grooves in them, like these statues were either

1909
01:59:51,214 --> 01:59:57,262
carved to pieces, like they were physically torn
down--

1910
01:59:57,262 --> 01:59:59,546
TALIESIN: Are you describing what you're seeing at
all?

1911
01:59:59,546 --> 02:00:01,420
SAM: Sure.

1912
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:06,180
TALIESIN: I can't have a reaction to this unless
I'm actually hearing anything.

1913
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:12,167
MARISHA: I do Control Water. Can I do Control
Water and clear away all the snow from around it?

1914
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,891
MATT: It takes you a little bit of concentration
because it's in a different state than liquid, but

1915
02:00:14,891 --> 02:00:21,339
you begin to focus, and as you guys are watching,
Keyleth focusing, a lot of the ice begins to

1916
02:00:21,339 --> 02:00:28,847
rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to
melt away, leaving the wet, muddy ground around it.

1917
02:00:28,847 --> 02:00:34,200
SAM: These statues that have been broken. They
have gashes and slashes in them?

1918
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,557
MATT: Yes, around the areas where they're broken.

1919
02:00:36,557 --> 02:00:38,672
SAM: Okay.

1920
02:00:38,672 --> 02:00:40,311
TALIESIN: Can I see the statues at this point?

1921
02:00:40,311 --> 02:00:41,685
MATT: From this distance? You can't,
unfortunately.

1922
02:00:41,685 --> 02:00:44,035
TALIESIN: I want to get a little closer, just so I
can make out the statues.

1923
02:00:44,035 --> 02:00:49,142
MATT: Okay. As the snowfall begins to melt away,
you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is

1924
02:00:49,142 --> 02:00:51,380
a garden of statue-pieces.

1925
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:53,226
SAM: Hey, hey guys!

1926
02:00:53,226 --> 02:00:56,809
TALIESIN: Are they classical statues or are they
people in weird poses? Are the poses weird?

1927
02:00:56,809 --> 02:00:59,011
MATT: Some poses look aggressive, some poses look
surprised--

1928
02:00:59,011 --> 02:01:00,443
SAM: Okay, everybody hey hey hey.

1929
02:01:00,443 --> 02:01:02,210
TALIESIN: Back up, everybody. Back up now.

1930
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:05,095
MATT: And we're going to go ahead and take a break
on that note.

1931
02:01:05,095 --> 02:01:07,501
LAURA: We fought basilisks in the Frostweald
before.

1932
02:01:07,501 --> 02:01:09,165
LIAM: Basilisks here, yes.

1933
02:01:09,165 --> 02:01:11,812
MATT: So. We're going to go ahead and take a quick
break here for the restroom and--

1934
02:01:11,812 --> 02:01:13,511
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1935
02:01:13,511 --> 02:01:15,847
ASHLEY: Son of a bitch.

1936
02:01:15,847 --> 02:01:17,493
MATT: See you guys here in a few minutes.

1937
02:01:17,493 --> 02:01:18,825
TRAVIS: I don't see what the problem is.

1938
02:01:18,825 --> 02:13:46,427
[break]

1939
02:13:46,427 --> 02:13:54,840
MATT: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. So. As
the snow is melted away, revealing this garden of

1940
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:59,567
statues in various states of-- some of them are
still solid, some of them are just missing pieces,

1941
02:13:59,567 --> 02:14:09,083
some of them are entirely shattered, many of them
crushed or torn, thick, heavy grooves visible on the

1942
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:16,144
pieces of them that have been torn asunder-- the
party begins to gather their thoughts and figure

1943
02:14:16,144 --> 02:14:20,651
out what this might be. You did notice as well
that there was writing or script among the bottom

1944
02:14:20,651 --> 02:14:25,934
of the obelisk, and as the snow melts away, there is
another large shape that is carved into it.

1945
02:14:25,934 --> 02:14:30,205
TRAVIS: Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and
just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off

1946
02:14:30,205 --> 02:14:31,299
of it?

1947
02:14:31,299 --> 02:14:38,365
MATT: Sure. As you walk up to the edge of the
obelisk and put your hand to it, no heat being

1948
02:14:38,365 --> 02:14:39,494
radiated.

1949
02:14:39,494 --> 02:14:45,930
MARISHA: I pull out the hunk of Quall again.
Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol.

1950
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:51,527
MATT: It does not seem to be reacting to anything
in the immediate vicinity.

1951
02:14:51,527 --> 02:14:54,418
TRAVIS: Man, somebody does not like sculptures.

1952
02:14:54,418 --> 02:14:56,132
SAM: That--

1953
02:14:56,132 --> 02:14:58,007
TALIESIN: Those aren't sculptures.

1954
02:14:58,007 --> 02:14:59,427
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

1955
02:14:59,427 --> 02:15:01,074
TRAVIS: No, it's art, I get it.

1956
02:15:01,074 --> 02:15:02,815
MATT: What languages do you know?

1957
02:15:02,815 --> 02:15:06,110
TRAVIS: It's like, interpretations and it seems
whimsical--

1958
02:15:06,110 --> 02:15:11,422
LAURA: Can I hop on the broom and fly up and see
if I could spot some basilisks around?

1959
02:15:11,422 --> 02:15:12,872
MATT: Sure.

1960
02:15:12,872 --> 02:15:15,397
ASHLEY: Well, Percy, what do you think they are?

1961
02:15:15,397 --> 02:15:16,757
TRAVIS: Where is she going?

1962
02:15:16,757 --> 02:15:23,227
MARISHA: Sorry. Elven, Sylvan, Druidic,
Primordial.

1963
02:15:23,227 --> 02:15:33,022
MATT: As you walk up and begin to hold the Hunk of
Quall towards it, you see that the language-- the

1964
02:15:33,022 --> 02:15:39,276
script that is beneath the initial symbol of Ioun
that Scanlan had seen is Elvish.

1965
02:15:39,276 --> 02:15:40,976
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

1966
02:15:40,976 --> 02:15:59,946
MATT: The rough translation is of old, old, old
text, it reads, "A name is earned."

1967
02:15:59,946 --> 02:16:02,509
MARISHA: A name is earned?

1968
02:16:02,509 --> 02:16:04,035
MATT: A name is earned.

1969
02:16:04,035 --> 02:16:05,639
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

1970
02:16:05,639 --> 02:16:12,249
MATT: And beneath it, there is what appears to
be-- the other large carving you saw on it-- it

1971
02:16:12,249 --> 02:16:18,782
looks like a triangle. A dark, recessed triangle
that is just built beneath the text that tapers

1972
02:16:18,782 --> 02:16:24,347
internally into a point. It is almost like a
reverse pyramid on the inside. It is just an empty

1973
02:16:24,347 --> 02:16:26,186
space that comes to a point.

1974
02:16:26,186 --> 02:16:30,443
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I think that there are basilisks
nearby.

1975
02:16:30,443 --> 02:16:32,940
LAURA: Do I see any?

1976
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:35,292
TALIESIN: I think these statues are victims.

1977
02:16:35,292 --> 02:16:40,282
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check? To see if I can
see any signs of basilisks?

1978
02:16:40,282 --> 02:16:42,977
MATT: Sure. Make a nature check and 
you make perception check.

1979
02:16:42,977 --> 02:16:48,609
SAM: Are we having a short-- is this a short
rest?

1980
02:16:48,609 --> 02:16:50,190
MATT: No.

1981
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:51,972
MARISHA: 21.

1982
02:16:51,972 --> 02:16:53,139
MATT: 21.

1983
02:16:53,139 --> 02:16:54,115
LAURA: 26.

1984
02:16:54,115 --> 02:17:02,668
MATT: 26. You glance up above, and you do not
see any basilisks. What you can see, this clearing

1985
02:17:02,668 --> 02:17:06,038
itself is visible from your height, but once
you get above the tree-line, you can see the trees

1986
02:17:06,038 --> 02:17:12,056
are pretty thick. You don't see any signs of
basilisks in the vicinity. You, upon looking around

1987
02:17:12,056 --> 02:17:18,123
the ground, you can see-- it's very muddy now from
all the snow that had melted down, and you see

1988
02:17:18,185 --> 02:17:28,696
that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the
ground. Like four-foot-wide cavernous holes that

1989
02:17:28,696 --> 02:17:33,631
were dug, like little burrows that now have all
this water and mud seeping into them.

1990
02:17:33,631 --> 02:17:35,923
MARISHA: Oh, it was made by a creature, it looks
like?

1991
02:17:35,923 --> 02:17:41,393
MATT: It looks like. Which one of them (bubbling),
expels a bunch of the mud and water, it just comes

1992
02:17:41,393 --> 02:17:47,730
bubbling outward. At which point, you see
something burst out and emerge onto the ground

1993
02:17:47,730 --> 02:17:55,488
nearby. More of these holes start bursting forth,
all the mud and liquid that has seeped into it is now

1994
02:17:55,488 --> 02:18:02,815
being forced outward, and these creatures, now
covered in mud, you can see long, lizard-like

1995
02:18:02,815 --> 02:18:08,104
bodies with a toothy snout, multiple legs, rows of
them of them down the spine, and its tail

1996
02:18:08,104 --> 02:18:09,484
flickering about.

1997
02:18:09,484 --> 02:18:10,791
LIAM: I'm closing my eyes.

1998
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:11,786
LAURA: Don't look at them!

1999
02:18:11,786 --> 02:18:13,199
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

2000
02:18:13,199 --> 02:18:16,886
MARISHA: Fuck. Shit. I'm standing right in the
middle of them.

2001
02:18:16,886 --> 02:18:20,814
TRAVIS: Fuck you.

2002
02:18:20,814 --> 02:18:23,524
MARISHA: Got the fucking shittiest initiative
rolls.

2003
02:18:23,524 --> 02:18:24,486
ASHLEY: Yikes.

2004
02:18:24,486 --> 02:18:26,434
TALIESIN: I have a terrible initiative roll.

2005
02:18:26,434 --> 02:18:28,173
SAM: Okay, this is it.

2006
02:18:28,173 --> 02:18:31,904
TRAVIS: Feral Instinct's screwing me up.

2007
02:18:31,904 --> 02:18:39,098
SAM: Battle in the snow. But we've got Ashley.

2008
02:18:39,098 --> 02:18:43,863
MATT: It's hard to see with the mud across their
surface, but you do see hints of blue coming

2009
02:18:43,863 --> 02:18:47,614
through. You have encountered these previously--
these are referred to as the ice-scaled basilisks,

2010
02:18:47,614 --> 02:18:57,823
the ones that are more specific to this indigenous
region. All righty. So, going by initiative order

2011
02:18:57,823 --> 02:18:59,914
here, folks, 25 to 20?

2012
02:18:59,914 --> 02:19:00,912
LAURA: 22.

2013
02:19:00,912 --> 02:19:02,059
MATT: 22.

2014
02:19:02,059 --> 02:19:03,242
TRAVIS: Percy?

2015
02:19:03,242 --> 02:19:05,265
MATT: 20 to 15?

2016
02:19:05,265 --> 02:19:06,205
LIAM: 18.

2017
02:19:06,205 --> 02:19:07,216
SAM: 19.

2018
02:19:07,216 --> 02:19:09,200
MATT: 15 to ten?

2019
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:13,529
TALIESIN: 13.

2020
02:19:13,529 --> 02:19:14,918
TRAVIS: 11.

2021
02:19:14,918 --> 02:19:16,081
MATT: All right.

2022
02:19:16,081 --> 02:19:17,378
TALIESIN: I rolled really badly.

2023
02:19:17,378 --> 02:19:18,350
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2024
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:19,474
LAURA: Pike?

2025
02:19:19,474 --> 02:19:22,658
ASHLEY: I know, I know, my initiative is always
shit.

2026
02:19:22,658 --> 02:19:25,444
TRAVIS: Welcome back, Pike!

2027
02:19:25,444 --> 02:19:31,381
LAURA: She likes to get the lay of the land before
she attacks.

2028
02:19:31,381 --> 02:19:33,690
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, you know, I do the clean-up.

2029
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:39,107
MATT: Is that everybody?

2030
02:19:39,107 --> 02:19:40,353
MARISHA: Pike.

2031
02:19:40,353 --> 02:19:41,447
ASHLEY: I'm eight.

2032
02:19:41,447 --> 02:19:49,293
MATT: Pike? Oh. All right. Due to the series of
rolls here, they're going last.

2033
02:19:49,293 --> 02:19:50,513
SAM: Oh!

2034
02:19:50,513 --> 02:19:56,051
MATT: They rolled a five, minus one penalty to
dex. So, as these-- which more of them burst up

2035
02:19:56,051 --> 02:20:00,460
right next to Scanlan right there.

2036
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:01,722
SAM: Oh, great.

2037
02:20:01,722 --> 02:20:04,291
MATT: As they all burst out of the ground, shaking
their heads off of the mud, swinging off, slapping

2038
02:20:04,291 --> 02:20:09,937
into the stone, splattering across the white snow
around them, across some of you, they snarl and

2039
02:20:09,937 --> 02:20:13,502
hiss. As you see their eyes now (click).

2040
02:20:13,502 --> 02:20:19,652
LIAM: Merry Christmas.

2041
02:20:19,652 --> 02:20:33,978
MATT: So, top of this would be you, Vex. You
actually would be on top here, on the broom,

2042
02:20:33,978 --> 02:20:35,279
looking from above.

2043
02:20:35,279 --> 02:20:39,533
LAURA: We can't look at them, right? We remember
that from before?

2044
02:20:39,533 --> 02:20:41,902
MATT: You remember, you'll want to try not to.

2045
02:20:41,902 --> 02:20:46,363
LAURA: Can we-- we can look at them to
shoot at them and look away? Just don't look at

2046
02:20:46,422 --> 02:20:47,298
them at all?

2047
02:20:47,298 --> 02:20:49,746
MATT: You can choose at the start of your turn whether
to avert your gaze or not. You'll have

2048
02:20:49,746 --> 02:20:52,402
disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as
you're doing that.

2049
02:20:52,402 --> 02:21:01,152
LAURA: Ah, that's so annoying! I can't tell how
everybody's clumped. They're-- just

2050
02:21:01,152 --> 02:21:03,374
basically they're all amongst all of our friends.

2051
02:21:03,374 --> 02:21:08,994
MATT: There's three right here, and one right
there behind. It's one, two, three, four.

2052
02:21:08,994 --> 02:21:14,052
LAURA: Okay. Can I fly down and land on a tall
tree?

2053
02:21:14,052 --> 02:21:16,448
MATT: You can try to.

2054
02:21:16,448 --> 02:21:18,064
LAURA: Try to brace myself?

2055
02:21:18,064 --> 02:21:19,332
MATT: If you would like to try to.

2056
02:21:19,332 --> 02:21:20,213
LAURA: Yeah.

2057
02:21:20,213 --> 02:21:30,402
MATT: Let's say for the purposes of this, that you
coast down to the height. Stupid broom. Let's say

2058
02:21:30,484 --> 02:21:36,267
you land down somewhere over here.

2059
02:21:36,267 --> 02:21:39,059
LAURA: Okay.

2060
02:21:39,083 --> 02:21:41,729
MATT: All righty? There you are.

2061
02:21:41,729 --> 02:21:51,009
LAURA: Okay. I avert my gaze-ish, I look off to
the side of one, but I can see it in my

2062
02:21:51,009 --> 02:21:53,003
peripheral, is that how it goes, or it's like--?

2063
02:21:53,003 --> 02:21:55,905
MATT: You kind of guess where it is real fast, in
the peripheral and kind of--

2064
02:21:55,905 --> 02:21:57,686
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark one.

2065
02:21:57,686 --> 02:21:58,998
MATT: Which one?

2066
02:21:58,998 --> 02:22:01,155
TRAVIS: Laser pointer.

2067
02:22:01,155 --> 02:22:05,651
LAURA: Is that Scanlan? That it's next to?

2068
02:22:05,651 --> 02:22:07,125
LIAM: Yeah, it's Scanlan next to one of them.

2069
02:22:07,125 --> 02:22:14,760
LAURA: I do the one next to Scanlan-- That was my
eye. That's just a flashlight. Oh, that's how I do

2070
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:15,851
it, okay.

2071
02:22:15,851 --> 02:22:19,323
MATT: And what are you doing?

2072
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:20,651
LAURA: I'm going to--

2073
02:22:20,651 --> 02:22:22,488
LIAM: Professional D&amp;D player.

2074
02:22:22,488 --> 02:22:24,914
LAURA: That's right. And I'm going to shoot it!

2075
02:22:24,914 --> 02:22:25,836
MATT: Go for it.

2076
02:22:25,836 --> 02:22:27,809
LAURA: Through the Blazing Bowstring.

2077
02:22:27,809 --> 02:22:31,559
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll with disadvantage
for the first strike.

2078
02:22:31,559 --> 02:22:36,868
LAURA: Oh, I don't get regular because it's my
favored terrain, so I cancel it all out?

2079
02:22:36,868 --> 02:22:44,293
MATT: It's disadvantage for averting your gaze,
advantage for being your favored terrain-- I

2080
02:22:44,293 --> 02:22:48,533
don't think you get advantage on attacks for being
in favored terrain, do you? I think it's just on

2081
02:22:48,533 --> 02:22:49,705
ability checks.

2082
02:22:49,705 --> 02:22:50,591
LAURA: Okay.

2083
02:22:50,591 --> 02:22:51,947
MATT: Yeah. So you're at disadvantage.

2084
02:22:51,947 --> 02:22:53,422
LAURA: I'm at disadvantage.

2085
02:22:53,422 --> 02:22:55,531
MATT: I'll double-check this so the internet
doesn't scream at me.

2086
02:22:55,531 --> 02:22:56,925
LAURA: 18.

2087
02:22:56,925 --> 02:22:58,624
MATT: 18 with disadvantage?

2088
02:22:58,624 --> 02:22:59,559
LAURA: Yeah.

2089
02:22:59,559 --> 02:23:01,805
MATT: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2090
02:23:01,805 --> 02:23:16,512
LAURA: Plus the Blazing Bowstring, plus an
additional d10.

2091
02:23:16,512 --> 02:23:21,352
MATT: First attack on the basilisk near Scanlan.

2092
02:23:21,352 --> 02:23:22,503
LAURA: 17.

2093
02:23:22,503 --> 02:23:25,853
MATT: 17 damage? All right, go ahead and roll for
the second attack, with disadvantage as well.

2094
02:23:25,853 --> 02:23:29,415
LAURA: 17.

2095
02:23:29,415 --> 02:23:34,812
MATT: 17 does hit as well. So roll for that one.
You included the Blazing Bowstring for the first

2096
02:23:34,812 --> 02:23:35,915
one, right?

2097
02:23:35,915 --> 02:23:40,424
LAURA: Yes. 15 on the second.

2098
02:23:40,424 --> 02:23:44,959
MATT: 15 points of damage. Holding on the top of
the tree, which is starting to bow a little bit

2099
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:51,730
with your weight, and you're clutching the broom
under one arm, and you pull back and release two

2100
02:23:51,730 --> 02:23:55,812
arrows in succession, both finding their mark. You
did Hunter's Mark damage on top of those?

2101
02:23:55,812 --> 02:23:56,718
LAURA: Yes I did.

2102
02:23:56,718 --> 02:24:01,223
MATT: All right, good. You see, Scanlan, as you
try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the

2103
02:24:01,223 --> 02:24:07,576
giant creature there, and you recall, two arrows
streak past, which gives you a little PTSD, based

2104
02:24:07,576 --> 02:24:12,807
on your morning. So that'll complete your turn?

2105
02:24:12,807 --> 02:24:14,158
LAURA: Yeah.

2106
02:24:14,158 --> 02:24:15,770
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

2107
02:24:15,770 --> 02:24:19,128
SAM: It's right next to me?

2108
02:24:19,128 --> 02:24:21,401
MATT: Yes. Are you averting your gaze or not?

2109
02:24:21,401 --> 02:24:23,145
SAM: I'm averting my gaze.

2110
02:24:23,145 --> 02:24:24,237
MATT: All righty.

2111
02:24:24,237 --> 02:24:26,522
SAM: Well jeez, I mean, do I know where they are?

2112
02:24:26,522 --> 02:24:32,991
MATT: You saw them all burst out, once they
shook off the mud, you heard her shouting and

2113
02:24:32,991 --> 02:24:34,582
you were like, oh, hmm.

2114
02:24:34,582 --> 02:24:41,542
SAM: So I kind of know where they are. All right.
I'm going to hop away five

2115
02:24:41,542 --> 02:24:48,475
feet from the guy who's-- I'm going to get an
attack-- yeah, that's a fine direction, sure.

2116
02:24:48,475 --> 02:24:51,107
MATT: It lunges out at you with a strike.

2117
02:24:51,107 --> 02:24:52,405
SAM: Yeah.

2118
02:24:52,405 --> 02:24:56,963
MATT: That is a 22 to hit?

2119
02:24:56,963 --> 02:24:58,169
SAM: Yeah.

2120
02:24:58,169 --> 02:25:07,146
MATT: All righty. As you pull away, pain strikes
your body as the sharp, stone-crumbling teeth of

2121
02:25:07,146 --> 02:25:15,517
the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12
points of piercing damage. You wrestle your elbow

2122
02:25:15,517 --> 02:25:19,608
out of the way, you can feel the wound beneath
your leather armor.

2123
02:25:19,608 --> 02:25:23,641
TALIESIN: That's barely an arrow and a chicken in
the neck.

2124
02:25:23,641 --> 02:25:28,513
SAM: (laughs) Okay. And I'm going to aim to the
one in the middle there-- does anyone have a

2125
02:25:28,513 --> 02:25:32,658
pointer? Yeah, that one. The other two are within
20 feet of him, yes?

2126
02:25:32,658 --> 02:25:33,917
MATT: Yes.

2127
02:25:33,917 --> 02:25:38,082
SAM: So I will cast a Wand of Fireballs right
there on him.

2128
02:25:38,082 --> 02:25:39,367
LAURA: Yeah!

2129
02:25:39,367 --> 02:25:40,795
MATT: On him or behind him, or where--?

2130
02:25:40,795 --> 02:25:42,993
SAM: Just behind him so it hits all three?

2131
02:25:42,993 --> 02:25:44,192
MATT: Right, and not yourself.

2132
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:45,167
SAM: Yes?

2133
02:25:45,167 --> 02:25:52,241
MATT: I figured that's probably what you want to do, 
okay. As you back up, release it in that direction, the beam of

2134
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:59,560
light streaks out from the wand, hitting the
snowbank right behind it and exploding. Already

2135
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:09,132
the slushy atmosphere is-- snow and fire scatter
around it as they both screech out in pain. DC of what?

2136
02:26:09,132 --> 02:26:13,101
SAM: Oh! DC 15! I wrote it down.

2137
02:26:13,101 --> 02:26:17,876
MATT: 15. That's... first one fails. Second one
rolled a 15, with its minus one dex, that's a 14,

2138
02:26:17,876 --> 02:26:22,302
that's a fail. And a natural one. So full damage
for all three of them. Go ahead and roll that 8d6.

2139
02:26:22,302 --> 02:26:27,290
Vax, you're on deck, so be ready.

2140
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:29,533
LIAM: All right, okay.

2141
02:26:29,533 --> 02:26:30,751
SAM: 25!

2142
02:26:30,751 --> 02:26:35,958
MATT: 25 points of damage total.

2143
02:26:35,958 --> 02:26:44,187
The flames subside after the force of the
explosion. The obelisk itself shakes from the

2144
02:26:44,187 --> 02:26:50,783
impact. The three basilisks look notably charred,
whatever mud was on them is immediately dried

2145
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:55,985
and is now cracking on the outside of their
scales. You hear the hissing at their presence.

2146
02:26:55,985 --> 02:26:58,823
You want to keep moving or stay where you are?

2147
02:26:58,823 --> 02:27:01,977
SAM: I'll tuck around the obelisk a little bit.

2148
02:27:01,977 --> 02:27:03,272
MATT: Okay.

2149
02:27:03,272 --> 02:27:14,460
SAM: And I'll turn to Pike, my love, and inspire
her with a song. I will sing, (singing) I used to

2150
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,564
scry you on the shit phone...

2151
02:27:16,564 --> 02:27:18,263
(laughter)

2152
02:27:18,263 --> 02:27:25,207
SAM: (singing) Late-night when I need your love! I
know when that poop phone glows, it can only be

2153
02:27:25,207 --> 02:27:30,096
one gnome! Ever since you left the party, you,
you--

2154
02:27:30,096 --> 02:27:32,355
(laughter)

2155
02:27:32,355 --> 02:27:33,328
TRAVIS: Yes!

2156
02:27:33,328 --> 02:27:38,487
MATT: Take your d10 inspiration die, Pike. All
right, so d10 inspiration die for you. Vax,

2157
02:27:38,487 --> 02:27:41,187
you're up.

2158
02:27:41,187 --> 02:27:48,568
LIAM: Yes. I'm going to click my heels together,
set the boots going. I'm going to go very far away

2159
02:27:48,568 --> 02:27:53,947
towards you, your end of the map. I want to be
about a little away from the tree, though, so I've

2160
02:27:53,947 --> 02:28:01,902
got a clear sight on that one-- further
back, though. I know. I want to be 50 feet away. Yeah.

2161
02:28:01,902 --> 02:28:04,443
MATT: Okay. You're far away, you're off-map.

2162
02:28:04,443 --> 02:28:08,802
LIAM: And I'm going to dagger-dagger-dagger him from
very far away.

2163
02:28:08,957 --> 02:28:09,905
MATT: Okay.

2164
02:28:10,037 --> 02:28:11,097
ASHLEY: Dagger-dagger-dagger!

2165
02:28:11,097 --> 02:28:16,659
LIAM: And I'm going to use that sharpshooter trick
where I take a negative five to attack, but add

2166
02:28:16,659 --> 02:28:17,904
ten to damage?

2167
02:28:17,904 --> 02:28:19,214
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2168
02:28:19,214 --> 02:28:20,318
LAURA: On all of them?

2169
02:28:20,318 --> 02:28:21,602
MATT: Are you averting your gaze?

2170
02:28:21,602 --> 02:28:22,598
LIAM: No.

2171
02:28:22,598 --> 02:28:23,786
SAM: Whoa!

2172
02:28:23,786 --> 02:28:26,366
MATT: All right, so at the start of your turn, on
your first part of the round, I want you to go

2173
02:28:26,366 --> 02:28:28,495
ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

2174
02:28:28,495 --> 02:28:30,147
LIAM: From this far away?

2175
02:28:30,147 --> 02:28:32,202
MATT: When you started your turn, you were in
melee.

2176
02:28:32,202 --> 02:28:33,928
LIAM: Okay. So constitution?

2177
02:28:33,928 --> 02:28:35,387
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

2178
02:28:35,387 --> 02:28:41,462
LIAM: 16.

2179
02:28:41,462 --> 02:28:43,186
MATT: 16 total?

2180
02:28:43,186 --> 02:28:44,195
LIAM: Yes.

2181
02:28:44,195 --> 02:28:49,511
MATT: Okay. The gaze is upon you as you glance
over and see the basilisk turn its head over its

2182
02:28:49,511 --> 02:28:53,914
shoulder at you and hisses, and the eyes catch
you. You can feel the magical effects take hold

2183
02:28:53,914 --> 02:28:59,214
of your body for a moment. You back away and
quickly close your eyes, and you can feel that it

2184
02:28:59,214 --> 02:29:01,222
begin to reach over but you shake it off.

2185
02:29:01,222 --> 02:29:03,376
LIAM: Oh yeah! Gamble worked out, man!

2186
02:29:03,376 --> 02:29:06,087
MATT: So you do not have disadvantage in these
attacks.

2187
02:29:06,087 --> 02:29:07,307
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

2188
02:29:07,307 --> 02:29:10,081
MATT: Minus five for each attack.

2189
02:29:10,081 --> 02:29:15,466
LIAM: First one, and advantage because I'm going
before it, so the first one is 18.

2190
02:29:15,466 --> 02:29:16,984
MATT: 18 hits.

2191
02:29:16,984 --> 02:29:25,514
LIAM: Second is 14. And the third is 27.

2192
02:29:25,514 --> 02:29:27,675
MATT: First hits, last hits.

2193
02:29:27,675 --> 02:29:28,878
LIAM: Last hits?

2194
02:29:28,878 --> 02:29:29,675
MATT: Yes.

2195
02:29:29,675 --> 02:29:34,024
LIAM: Okay. First one gets sneak attack damage,
and plus ten to both hits because of the

2196
02:29:34,063 --> 02:29:34,986
sharpshooter.

2197
02:29:34,986 --> 02:29:35,949
MATT: Correct.

2198
02:29:35,949 --> 02:29:37,827
LIAM: Right. So, here we go.

2199
02:29:37,827 --> 02:29:48,125
LAURA: (singing) There can only be one gnome.

2200
02:29:48,508 --> 02:29:58,987
LIAM: I can't think! 33.... 43 for the first one.

2201
02:29:58,987 --> 02:30:02,147
SAM: 43?!

2202
02:30:02,147 --> 02:30:09,579
LIAM: No-no-no... 43 plus... 49 for the first
one.

2203
02:30:09,579 --> 02:30:11,067
MATT: 49 points of damage.

2204
02:30:11,067 --> 02:30:16,374
LIAM: And the last one that hits is 19.
Sharpshooter.

2205
02:30:16,374 --> 02:30:24,715
MATT: As you run backwards, at the basilisk
glaring back at you, its toothy mouth opening and

2206
02:30:24,715 --> 02:30:30,862
the breath out, you shake it off. Throw the
daggers. One (impact) sticks into one eye, and the

2207
02:30:30,862 --> 02:30:32,922
other just (impact) into the other, and it--

2208
02:30:32,922 --> 02:30:35,564
(cheering)

2209
02:30:35,564 --> 02:30:37,628
MARISHA: Damn!

2210
02:30:37,628 --> 02:30:40,829
LAURA: That was fast.

2211
02:30:40,829 --> 02:30:45,100
MATT: The snow nearby is spattered with this kind
of dark-purple basilisk blood.

2212
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:47,881
SAM: Ugh! My eyes...

2213
02:30:47,881 --> 02:30:49,857
LAURA: (gasp) Basilisk blood! We need to take the
basilisk blood! Remember, that's super good...

2214
02:30:49,857 --> 02:30:51,492
MARISHA: Yes! Yup. Uh-huh.

2215
02:30:51,492 --> 02:30:53,447
MATT: You want to stay where you are?

2216
02:30:53,447 --> 02:31:00,989
LIAM: I will take another ten feet back away from
it all. Bye, guys!

2217
02:31:01,028 --> 02:31:02,705
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

2218
02:31:02,705 --> 02:31:04,527
TALIESIN: Okay!

2219
02:31:04,527 --> 02:31:05,836
MATT: Avert your gaze or... ?

2220
02:31:05,836 --> 02:31:07,316
TALIESIN: No.

2221
02:31:07,316 --> 02:31:09,234
MATT: Roll a constitution save.

2222
02:31:09,234 --> 02:31:10,491
MARISHA: Gamblers!

2223
02:31:10,491 --> 02:31:13,871
LIAM: (singing) You got to know when to hold 'em!

2224
02:31:13,871 --> 02:31:23,812
TALIESIN: That's a... (counts) 21 points.

2225
02:31:23,812 --> 02:31:25,702
MATT: 21?

2226
02:31:25,702 --> 02:31:27,120
TALIESIN: Constitution save.

2227
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,628
SAM: Oh, it's a save! That's right!

2228
02:31:28,628 --> 02:31:29,601
MATT: What did you roll?

2229
02:31:29,601 --> 02:31:30,807
TALIESIN: I rolled a 14 plus seven.

2230
02:31:30,807 --> 02:31:31,988
MATT: That's great!

2231
02:31:31,988 --> 02:31:33,230
TALIESIN: I look at it in the eye.

2232
02:31:33,230 --> 02:31:36,062
MATT: You stare it down and it kind of (snarls).

2233
02:31:36,062 --> 02:31:39,174
TALIESIN: (barks) Bark it down.

2234
02:31:39,174 --> 02:31:42,686
MATT: Orthax has left his mark on you.

2235
02:31:42,686 --> 02:31:47,064
TALIESIN: I know. I cast Hex on it. I'm looking at
the one she's Hunter's Marked, I cast Hex.

2236
02:31:47,064 --> 02:31:48,284
LAURA: Ooh, nice!

2237
02:31:48,284 --> 02:31:50,264
LIAM: Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?

2238
02:31:50,264 --> 02:31:51,355
MATT: Same one that she's Hunter's Marked?

2239
02:31:51,355 --> 02:32:04,453
TALIESIN: Yeah. And I'm taking... I'm giving it a
disadvantage on willpower ability checks.

2240
02:32:04,453 --> 02:32:05,873
MATT: Okay.

2241
02:32:05,873 --> 02:32:11,398
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take three shots with
Sharpshooter.

2242
02:32:11,398 --> 02:32:12,725
MATT: Go for it.

2243
02:32:12,725 --> 02:32:20,826
TALIESIN: 12. Misses.

2244
02:32:20,826 --> 02:32:22,452
MATT: Misses, unfortunately.

2245
02:32:22,452 --> 02:32:33,736
TALIESIN: Oh my god, goodbye! Going to the good
die, 12.... Better! 24.

2246
02:32:33,736 --> 02:32:41,273
MATT: Yeah, third shot hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
With the Hex damage as well.

2247
02:32:41,273 --> 02:32:44,850
TALIESIN: Oh my god! I'm sucking. 22 points of
damage.

2248
02:32:44,850 --> 02:32:51,106
MATT: 22 points of damage. So the first shot goes
wide. Second shot goes wide again. For some

2249
02:32:51,106 --> 02:32:55,701
reason, it's moving faster than you expected at
this moment, missing your sights. The third shot

2250
02:32:55,701 --> 02:32:58,728
manages to find the front of its nose and
(shattering) the front of its skull shatters and

2251
02:32:58,728 --> 02:33:02,472
it kind of crumbles to the ground.

2252
02:33:02,472 --> 02:33:05,547
TALIESIN: So, while shooting, I ran from that one
tree all the way to the other one. That was a

2253
02:33:05,547 --> 02:33:06,869
running shot, so...

2254
02:33:06,869 --> 02:33:08,181
MATT: Okay, so you run this way?

2255
02:33:08,181 --> 02:33:08,940
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2256
02:33:08,940 --> 02:33:10,212
LIAM: It was a lot harder the last time.

2257
02:33:10,212 --> 02:33:12,582
TALIESIN: Behind the tree over there.

2258
02:33:12,582 --> 02:33:16,528
MATT: Over here? Because you can only get 
about that far with your running.

2259
02:33:16,528 --> 02:33:17,773
TALIESIN: About there.

2260
02:33:17,773 --> 02:33:20,482
MATT: Right there? Okay. Then you got behind
there. That's fine. All right, that ends your

2261
02:33:20,482 --> 02:33:22,317
turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

2262
02:33:22,317 --> 02:33:29,687
TRAVIS: I would like to avert my gaze, and go into
an averted-gaze rage! (growls)

2263
02:33:29,687 --> 02:33:31,182
(laughter)

2264
02:33:31,182 --> 02:33:36,065
TRAVIS: And I would like to run at that little
bastard right there.

2265
02:33:36,065 --> 02:33:37,182
MATT: All right.

2266
02:33:37,182 --> 02:33:39,043
LIAM: (Grog voice) I can't see you but I'm so
angry!

2267
02:33:39,043 --> 02:33:46,315
TRAVIS: I'm using my Feral-- no, that's wrong. I'm
using my... what the fuck is it called?

2268
02:33:46,315 --> 02:33:50,741
TALIESIN: Slap Fight. Hair Pull.

2269
02:33:50,741 --> 02:33:53,300
TRAVIS: I've totally forgotten what's it called. What
the fuck is it? Reckless Attack!

2270
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:54,650
MATT: All right, there you go.

2271
02:33:54,650 --> 02:33:58,065
TRAVIS: Yes. So can I cancel out the disadvantage
and get just a normal roll?

2272
02:33:58,065 --> 02:33:59,356
MATT: Yes, you would have a normal roll on this.

2273
02:33:59,356 --> 02:34:01,909
TRAVIS: Yes! And Great Weapon Master on these two
strikes.

2274
02:34:01,909 --> 02:34:03,573
MATT: All right.

2275
02:34:03,573 --> 02:34:06,512
TRAVIS: Shit! Nine.

2276
02:34:06,512 --> 02:34:09,031
MATT: (whoosh)

2277
02:34:09,031 --> 02:34:12,939
TRAVIS: (yells) (laughs) Shit! Nope.

2278
02:34:12,939 --> 02:34:15,916
LAURA: It's a bad luck night for Grog rolling!

2279
02:34:15,916 --> 02:34:19,583
MATT: You rush forward (sword swinging). You
thought it was there, you're sure it was there,

2280
02:34:19,583 --> 02:34:22,413
you heard it hiss. It's about two inches below
where you swung.

2281
02:34:22,413 --> 02:34:27,872
TRAVIS: I'm so mad that I come out of my rage
because I don't hit anything, right?

2282
02:34:27,872 --> 02:34:30,345
MATT: You don't have to hit it. You have to
attack. There's a difference.

2283
02:34:30,345 --> 02:34:33,158
TRAVIS: Well, I've been swinging.

2284
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:35,665
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) Ending Grog's turn, Keyleth,
you're up.

2285
02:34:35,665 --> 02:34:38,904
MARISHA: How many are left? Two?

2286
02:34:38,904 --> 02:34:40,905
MATT: There are two left.

2287
02:34:40,905 --> 02:34:47,578
MARISHA: I am remembering what the basilisks did
last time, and I've only done this once before,

2288
02:34:47,578 --> 02:34:49,803
and am going to go...

2289
02:34:49,803 --> 02:34:51,440
MATT: Avert your gaze or not?

2290
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:56,665
MARISHA: I'm looking down and transforming into a
giant scorpion.

2291
02:34:56,665 --> 02:35:00,303
TALIESIN: Scorpions are fascinating.

2292
02:35:00,303 --> 02:35:04,335
SAM: How so? They don't have eyes, or something?

2293
02:35:04,335 --> 02:35:05,918
MARISHA: Yeah, they have blindsight.

2294
02:35:05,918 --> 02:35:10,053
SAM: Wait, what does that mean?

2295
02:35:10,053 --> 02:35:15,031
MARISHA: It means they don't use their eyes to see
things. They have blindsight.

2296
02:35:15,031 --> 02:35:19,148
MATT: So Scanlan, as you're averting your gaze,
you glance over as Keyleth goes (poof) into this

2297
02:35:19,148 --> 02:35:25,349
giant scorpion, big tail, big pincers, black and
red carapace. It's upsetting.

2298
02:35:25,349 --> 02:35:27,850
SAM: I'm scared.

2299
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:29,436
MARISHA: (clicking pincers)

2300
02:35:29,436 --> 02:35:31,891
TALIESIN: That's really upsetting.

2301
02:35:31,891 --> 02:35:36,091
MARISHA: Where are they? The two are kind of in
the middle there?

2302
02:35:36,091 --> 02:35:37,420
SAM: One's next to Grog.

2303
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:45,370
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to move in between them
and I'm going to do a multiattack on both of

2304
02:35:45,370 --> 02:35:48,194
those. I'll start on the one that Grog's not
focusing on.

2305
02:35:48,194 --> 02:35:50,072
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2306
02:35:50,072 --> 02:35:53,523
MARISHA: So I have three attacks, two with my
claws and one with my stinger.

2307
02:35:53,523 --> 02:35:57,397
MATT: Do it. Disadvantage on all attacks.

2308
02:35:57,397 --> 02:35:59,306
MARISHA: No, why?

2309
02:35:59,306 --> 02:36:00,751
MATT: Because you averted your gaze.

2310
02:36:00,751 --> 02:36:03,587
MARISHA: No, I didn't. I have blindsight as a
scorpion.

2311
02:36:03,587 --> 02:36:07,629
MATT: Right, but at the start of your turn, before
anything happens, is when it happens. Did you

2312
02:36:07,629 --> 02:36:08,925
avert your gaze or not?

2313
02:36:08,925 --> 02:36:10,500
MARISHA: No, I turned into a scorpion.

2314
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:13,323
MATT: Before that happened, at the start of your
turn, did you avert your gaze or not?

2315
02:36:13,323 --> 02:36:14,753
LIAM: You said you averted your gaze.

2316
02:36:14,753 --> 02:36:18,522
MARISHA: I said I looked down, but once I'm a
scorpion, I have blindsight.

2317
02:36:18,522 --> 02:36:24,305
MATT: Right, but the effect takes place before
your transformation happens. So, yes or no, do you

2318
02:36:24,305 --> 02:36:25,691
want to take the advantage or not?

2319
02:36:25,691 --> 02:36:31,420
MARISHA: Well, I said I looked down and turned
into a scorpion to try and avoid it, so... I mean,

2320
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:32,587
I did, yeah.

2321
02:36:32,587 --> 02:36:34,348
MATT: All right, so disadvantage on the attacks.

2322
02:36:34,348 --> 02:36:36,532
MARISHA: That's the whole reason I did the
scorpion.

2323
02:36:36,532 --> 02:36:38,403
SAM: But it's also looking cool.

2324
02:36:38,403 --> 02:36:40,130
LAURA: It's okay, from here on out, you're fine.

2325
02:36:40,130 --> 02:36:48,578
MARISHA: Miss. Six misses, for the first one.
That's a three, it misses again. Nope, that's a

2326
02:36:48,578 --> 02:36:58,967
two. Last one is an eight, plus a four... So
that's 12. Probably still nothing.

2327
02:36:58,967 --> 02:37:02,628
MATT: Let me think here for a second. The scorpion
has blindsight?

2328
02:37:02,628 --> 02:37:07,358
SAM: Starring Ashley Johnson! Blindsight!

2329
02:37:07,358 --> 02:37:13,535
TALIESIN: How did we not walk into that? How have
we been sitting here and that didn't happen?

2330
02:37:13,535 --> 02:37:18,539
MARISHA: That legitimately made me spit my fucking
coffee in my face.

2331
02:37:18,539 --> 02:37:26,170
MATT: No, you're right. I was thinking more in
terms of it averting the magical power of the

2332
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:29,671
basilisk, but you could still avert and blindsight
would allow you to still know where it is without

2333
02:37:29,671 --> 02:37:31,314
having the disadvantage, so yes.

2334
02:37:31,314 --> 02:37:33,963
LIAM: Although with coffee in the eye,
disadvantage is back.

2335
02:37:33,963 --> 02:37:37,011
MATT: This is true. I'll let you reroll those
attacks.

2336
02:37:37,011 --> 02:37:42,183
MARISHA: All three? Okay, I wish I remembered
them. Do you want me to reroll all three?

2337
02:37:42,183 --> 02:37:46,881
MATT: Just reroll all three. That's on me. I was
thinking in wrong terms.

2338
02:37:46,881 --> 02:37:48,045
SAM: Matt, you're the worst.

2339
02:37:48,045 --> 02:37:49,650
MATT: I know. I know, I am the worst.

2340
02:37:49,650 --> 02:37:52,070
MARISHA: Jeez, I'm going to tweet at you later
about this.

2341
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:54,749
TALIESIN: Actually Matt, how blindsight works...

2342
02:37:54,749 --> 02:37:58,691
MATT: They've already been sent, I'm sure.

2343
02:37:58,691 --> 02:38:00,214
TALIESIN: I'm shutting the fuck up now.

2344
02:38:00,214 --> 02:38:06,020
MARISHA: These are just straight, they don't have
disadvantage? First attack, 14.

2345
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:07,595
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.

2346
02:38:07,595 --> 02:38:11,626
MARISHA: Second attack was a natural 18, so 22.

2347
02:38:11,626 --> 02:38:14,386
MATT: That does hit. And for the tail?

2348
02:38:14,386 --> 02:38:17,567
MARISHA: For the tail, 16.

2349
02:38:17,567 --> 02:38:24,330
MATT: 16 hits. That was my bad.

2350
02:38:24,330 --> 02:38:28,622
LIAM: Just a bunch of idiots dorking around,
guys.

2351
02:38:28,622 --> 02:38:31,566
TALIESIN: There is coffee everywhere.

2352
02:38:31,566 --> 02:38:47,388
MARISHA: That's not very much. Four damage for the
claw attack, and then for the sting, oh my god.

2353
02:38:47,388 --> 02:38:52,735
Three damage, and they have to take a constitution
saving throw.

2354
02:38:52,735 --> 02:38:55,525
MATT: 15, what's the DC?

2355
02:38:55,525 --> 02:38:57,526
MARISHA: 12.

2356
02:38:57,526 --> 02:38:58,798
MATT: Yeah, so it makes the save.

2357
02:38:58,798 --> 02:38:59,946
MARISHA: Fuck.

2358
02:38:59,946 --> 02:39:03,779
SAM: Yeah, Keyleth, good one!

2359
02:39:03,779 --> 02:39:09,289
MARISHA: Okay, they take 4d10 poison, and on a
failed save, they take half as much.

2360
02:39:09,289 --> 02:39:10,657
MATT: Okay, so roll 4d10.

2361
02:39:10,657 --> 02:39:12,966
SAM: 4d10 is a lot!

2362
02:39:12,966 --> 02:39:15,179
LAURA: You should be a scorpion all the time!

2363
02:39:15,179 --> 02:39:23,256
MARISHA: Thanks guys! Wow, these are fucking
horrifying rolls. Six, seven, eight, nine, plus

2364
02:39:23,256 --> 02:39:27,871
seven is 16 points of poison damage.

2365
02:39:27,871 --> 02:39:30,205
MATT: Total, so that would be eight for half of
it.

2366
02:39:30,205 --> 02:39:32,228
MARISHA: No, that is halved.

2367
02:39:32,228 --> 02:39:39,275
MATT: Nice, that's not bad at all. All right, so
as your first claw streaks off its armor, the

2368
02:39:39,275 --> 02:39:43,163
second one grabs hold and-- hold on a second.

2369
02:39:43,163 --> 02:39:44,287
LIAM: I'm listening!

2370
02:39:44,287 --> 02:39:45,532
MATT: Thank you.

2371
02:39:45,532 --> 02:39:47,170
MARISHA: Sorry, it was eight damage.

2372
02:39:47,170 --> 02:39:48,921
TALIESIN: No, you did, because you did half the
dice.

2373
02:39:48,921 --> 02:39:50,666
SAM: No, she did 4d10.

2374
02:39:50,666 --> 02:39:51,843
TALIESIN: She did 4d10?

2375
02:39:51,843 --> 02:39:52,942
MARISHA: Eight damage.

2376
02:39:52,942 --> 02:40:01,071
MATT: Eight damage, all right. All right, so as the
first claw streaks across its armor, second one

2377
02:40:01,071 --> 02:40:05,930
manages to grab and actually pince onto it,
dealing some damage. As you're holding it there,

2378
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:10,589
the tail strikes inward, manages to pierce the
outside of the scaly basilisk hide. Not as

2379
02:40:10,589 --> 02:40:14,054
effective as it could've been, but still you see
its body tense with the sudden pulse of poison in

2380
02:40:14,054 --> 02:40:17,041
its system. That brings us to Pike! What's up?

2381
02:40:17,041 --> 02:40:25,200
ASHLEY: Okay. Since I can't see it, is there any
way that I can Guiding Bolt one of the basilisks

2382
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,497
without hurting anybody?

2383
02:40:27,497 --> 02:40:34,479
MATT: Yeah, but for Guiding Bolt I believe it's a
spell attack roll. Am I correct on that? Or does

2384
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:38,827
it automatically hit? I'm trying to remember which
one it is. You guys have so many spells. Guiding

2385
02:40:38,827 --> 02:40:43,319
Bolt, yeah. You can totally Guiding Bolt. You'll
have disadvantage on the attack roll, but you can

2386
02:40:43,319 --> 02:40:44,603
do it still.

2387
02:40:44,603 --> 02:40:46,972
LAURA: Do it, Pike!

2388
02:40:46,972 --> 02:40:48,974
ASHLEY: All right, let's do it!

2389
02:40:48,974 --> 02:40:51,356
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll with
disadvantage on the attack.

2390
02:40:51,356 --> 02:40:55,005
SAM: Which one, the one near Grog or the one near
scorpion-face?

2391
02:40:55,005 --> 02:40:58,495
ASHLEY: Which one would I not hurt anybody?

2392
02:40:58,495 --> 02:41:04,174
MATT: It's not so much you hurting anybody, you
wouldn't hit anybody. It's about if you miss or not.

2393
02:41:04,174 --> 02:41:05,837
MARISHA: Grog and I can take it anyway.

2394
02:41:05,837 --> 02:41:06,811
ASHLEY: Okay.

2395
02:41:06,811 --> 02:41:09,468
LIAM: The one by Grog.

2396
02:41:09,468 --> 02:41:11,527
ASHLEY: Yeah, we'll do the one by Grog.

2397
02:41:11,527 --> 02:41:12,908
MATT: Okay.

2398
02:41:12,908 --> 02:41:15,085
ASHLEY: Oh, natural 20!

2399
02:41:15,085 --> 02:41:19,892
MATT: But it's with disadvantage, so you have to
roll it again.

2400
02:41:19,892 --> 02:41:21,949
LIAM: Say it again.

2401
02:41:21,949 --> 02:41:24,358
TALIESIN: One in 20 chance.

2402
02:41:24,358 --> 02:41:28,415
ASHLEY: 13.

2403
02:41:28,415 --> 02:41:34,282
MATT: With that, unfortunately, as you're holding
your eyes at bay--

2404
02:41:34,282 --> 02:41:36,056
SAM: Wait! You're inspired!

2405
02:41:36,056 --> 02:41:38,236
MATT: You can add the inspiration dice if you want
to.

2406
02:41:38,236 --> 02:41:40,291
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll add inspiration!

2407
02:41:40,291 --> 02:41:43,035
MATT: Okay, so roll a d10 and add that to the
attack. 13 plus...

2408
02:41:43,035 --> 02:41:51,396
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. All right, seven. So
20.

2409
02:41:51,396 --> 02:41:55,282
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on Guiding Bolt. So
4d6 radiant damage.

2410
02:41:55,282 --> 02:42:07,679
ASHLEY: Okay... 17!

2411
02:42:07,679 --> 02:42:13,817
MATT: Nice, all right! 17 points of radiant
damage, and now there is a glowing hue of radiant

2412
02:42:13,817 --> 02:42:18,023
light around it, so even though you're not looking
at it, it's a pretty decent beacon, so it gives

2413
02:42:18,023 --> 02:42:23,163
advantage on the next attack roll against it. Keep
that in mind. Do you want to move at all or do you

2414
02:42:23,163 --> 02:42:24,633
want to stay where you are, Pike?

2415
02:42:24,633 --> 02:42:27,338
ASHLEY: I'll stay, yeah, I'll stay.

2416
02:42:27,338 --> 02:42:33,832
MATT: All right. Now it is their turn. This one
turns around and it's going to go ahead and make a

2417
02:42:33,832 --> 02:42:39,960
bite attack against you, Keyleth, in scorpion
form. That's a 17, plus six?

2418
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:41,284
MARISHA: That hits.

2419
02:42:41,284 --> 02:42:51,026
MATT: All right. You take 11, plus three. 14
points of piercing damage, plus seven points of

2420
02:42:51,026 --> 02:42:52,356
poison damage.

2421
02:42:52,356 --> 02:42:55,036
MARISHA: So that was 21?

2422
02:42:55,036 --> 02:42:58,782
TALIESIN: My brain is not doing numbers for some
reason.

2423
02:42:58,782 --> 02:43:01,119
MARISHA: I know, and I keep looking at you.

2424
02:43:01,119 --> 02:43:09,042
MATT: Against you, Grog... It hits you regardless.
It has advantage on you because you're averting

2425
02:43:09,042 --> 02:43:16,336
your gaze, plus you had your reckless attack last
round. It still only rolls a nine, plus six, so

2426
02:43:16,336 --> 02:43:18,875
that's 14? 15 to hit.

2427
02:43:18,875 --> 02:43:20,167
TRAVIS: Misses.

2428
02:43:20,167 --> 02:43:22,730
MATT: This one bites out towards you, and even
though it's not there, because it's so bright, you

2429
02:43:22,730 --> 02:43:28,066
see it shift, and you (boom) hit it in the front
of its snout with the base of your sword. That

2430
02:43:28,066 --> 02:43:33,555
brings us to the top of the initiative order. Vex,
you're up.

2431
02:43:33,555 --> 02:43:41,121
LAURA: Awesome. So it's the glowing one, I get
advantage on the attack, because it's glowing?

2432
02:43:41,121 --> 02:43:42,408
MATT: You do, yes.

2433
02:43:42,408 --> 02:43:43,682
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark it.

2434
02:43:43,682 --> 02:43:45,339
MATT: Okay, so Hunter's Mark moves over.

2435
02:43:45,339 --> 02:43:52,116
LAURA: I'm going to avert my gaze, and roll a
regular attack then? Since it's advantage?

2436
02:43:52,116 --> 02:43:56,281
MATT: Yes. It cancels out the disadvantage. So
roll your first attack against it.

2437
02:43:56,281 --> 02:44:00,883
LAURA: That's 31.

2438
02:44:00,883 --> 02:44:03,161
MATT: 31 hits, yeah.

2439
02:44:03,161 --> 02:44:10,328
LAURA: 15 plus Hunter's Mark-- Oh, I didn't
Hunter's Mark it.

2440
02:44:10,328 --> 02:44:12,011
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah, you did.

2441
02:44:12,011 --> 02:44:16,634
LAURA: Okay! What did I say, 15? 18.

2442
02:44:16,634 --> 02:44:21,629
MATT: 18, all right. So the first arrow strikes
into it. It's still standing. It's looking a

2443
02:44:21,629 --> 02:44:23,681
little hurt, but it's still standing.

2444
02:44:23,681 --> 02:44:25,977
LAURA: And then do I still get regular attacks?
This is at disadvantage.

2445
02:44:25,977 --> 02:44:27,782
MATT: Disadvantage on the next one, yeah.

2446
02:44:27,782 --> 02:44:28,984
LAURA: 19?

2447
02:44:28,984 --> 02:44:35,145
MATT: Yeah. What's your total? 19 with
disadvantage? That does hit, yep.

2448
02:44:35,145 --> 02:44:40,247
LAURA: 18.

2449
02:44:40,247 --> 02:44:45,050
MATT: 18, all right. This arrow, however, manages
to strike through the top of the head, stapling

2450
02:44:45,050 --> 02:44:48,595
the mouth shut, and it falls to the ground as its
eyes slowly glaze over.

2451
02:44:48,595 --> 02:44:52,040
LAURA: I roar from up in the tree!

2452
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:55,018
TALIESIN: Wait, do you let go of the broom to
roar?

2453
02:44:55,018 --> 02:44:57,409
LAURA: No, I hold the broom in my hand!

2454
02:44:57,409 --> 02:44:59,150
MARISHA: Katy Perry style.

2455
02:44:59,150 --> 02:45:00,731
LAURA: Defying Gravity style.

2456
02:45:00,731 --> 02:45:03,082
LIAM: Holding it in your hand while you're flying
on it?

2457
02:45:03,082 --> 02:45:05,299
LAURA: I'm not flying, I'm in a tree, dude.

2458
02:45:05,299 --> 02:45:07,512
MATT: Yeah, she's clutched up on top of a tree.

2459
02:45:07,512 --> 02:45:09,105
LIAM: I'm not looking at you.

2460
02:45:09,105 --> 02:45:13,262
MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. Are
you averting your gaze or not?

2461
02:45:13,262 --> 02:45:20,409
SAM: I'm not only averting my gaze, I'm looking
towards the holes that it came out of, any of the

2462
02:45:20,409 --> 02:45:22,009
holes that are near me.

2463
02:45:22,009 --> 02:45:24,364
MATT: There's two that are near you.

2464
02:45:24,364 --> 02:45:31,303
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go over to one and throw a
Fireball down into it.

2465
02:45:31,303 --> 02:45:38,925
MATT: Okay! So, Scanlan, you walk over to the
nearby holes behind you, where the one that snuck

2466
02:45:38,925 --> 02:45:43,958
up behind you essentially came out of, aim down,
and make sure you mark off these charges for each

2467
02:45:43,958 --> 02:45:45,174
use of the wand.

2468
02:45:45,174 --> 02:45:46,254
SAM: Yes.

2469
02:45:46,254 --> 02:45:53,795
MATT: You (whoosh) release the beam, which gets
about 15, 20 feet down before it blasts. I need

2470
02:45:53,795 --> 02:45:55,838
you to make a dexterity saving throw.

2471
02:45:55,838 --> 02:45:58,799
TRAVIS: Like putting yourself at the mouth of a
cannon.

2472
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:01,173
SAM: Seven.

2473
02:46:01,173 --> 02:46:03,120
LAURA: Oh no!

2474
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:16,258
MATT: Roll 8d6. But take half damage, because it's
mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial, at

2475
02:46:16,258 --> 02:46:21,041
the outskirts of it, you're not taking the full
brunt of the Fireball. However, you do get caught

2476
02:46:21,041 --> 02:46:23,346
in the very edge of the backblast.

2477
02:46:23,346 --> 02:46:24,770
SAM: 29.

2478
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:29,368
MATT: So you take half that. So you take 15 points
of fire damage and are blown about five feet

2479
02:46:29,368 --> 02:46:34,588
backward onto the ground. However, the ground
shudders beneath all your feet, and the earth, the

2480
02:46:34,588 --> 02:46:39,607
wet damp earth (squelch) sinks inward and the
tunnel collapses. A few of the others (squelch)

2481
02:46:39,607 --> 02:46:46,917
into it. There's still a couple more on the
opposite side that are open. There's two more on

2482
02:46:46,917 --> 02:46:48,036
this side that are open.

2483
02:46:48,036 --> 02:46:50,103
SAM: So the tunnels nearest me are not accessible
anymore.

2484
02:46:50,103 --> 02:46:55,440
MATT: The two that were there and there both, the
ground from it shuddering, collapsed inward, and

2485
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:59,461
now the mud has filled the space. There's these
small sinkholes where they were.

2486
02:46:59,461 --> 02:47:09,351
SAM: All right. I'll spend the rest of my time in
this round licking my wounds and studying the

2487
02:47:09,351 --> 02:47:14,461
obelisk to see if I can see any other clues or
anything on it.

2488
02:47:14,461 --> 02:47:22,730
MATT: Okay. You can see the text that she saw upon
there, the Elvish script.

2489
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:24,938
SAM: I can't read it, though.

2490
02:47:24,938 --> 02:47:30,355
MATT: But you see it there, and you see the
triangle, a dark recessed triangle about that big

2491
02:47:30,355 --> 02:47:33,488
that is in the base of it.

2492
02:47:33,488 --> 02:47:34,902
SAM: Is it a hole, or is it...?

2493
02:47:34,902 --> 02:47:38,110
MATT: It's a hole, but it's carved. It's not a
perfect triangle, it starts as a triangle and

2494
02:47:38,110 --> 02:47:41,022
slowly, as it recesses inward, comes to a point
towards the back.

2495
02:47:41,022 --> 02:47:42,651
TALIESIN: Like a reverse pyramid.

2496
02:47:42,651 --> 02:47:44,431
SAM: I throw a snowball in it.

2497
02:47:44,431 --> 02:47:45,970
MATT: (impact)

2498
02:47:45,970 --> 02:47:47,603
SAM: It's safe, guys.

2499
02:47:47,603 --> 02:47:49,742
MATT: Vax, you're up.

2500
02:47:49,742 --> 02:47:53,936
LIAM: All right, I'm off the map, but I want to
try to come down towards the tree that I think

2501
02:47:53,936 --> 02:47:59,912
Percy's at. He's between two trees. I'm going to
avert my gaze, I'm going to look at the ground,

2502
02:47:59,912 --> 02:48:05,132
come up around the side of that tree, and I'm
listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk

2503
02:48:05,132 --> 02:48:12,357
hissing, and I'm going to throw, dagger dagger
dagger, in the direction of the basilisk I hear

2504
02:48:12,357 --> 02:48:17,526
near scorpion claws clutching. Does that make
sense?

2505
02:48:17,526 --> 02:48:18,845
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2506
02:48:18,845 --> 02:48:23,111
LIAM: All right. So this is at disadvantage
because I'm looking at the ground. So first one

2507
02:48:23,111 --> 02:48:26,477
is... first one is a 21.

2508
02:48:26,477 --> 02:48:27,900
MATT: 21 hits.

2509
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:31,977
LIAM: And second one is... 19?

2510
02:48:31,977 --> 02:48:33,165
MATT: Hits.

2511
02:48:33,165 --> 02:48:35,278
LIAM: Third one is 16.

2512
02:48:35,278 --> 02:48:37,528
MATT: Hits. These are not with Sharpshooter?

2513
02:48:37,528 --> 02:48:49,064
LIAM: No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine,
plus ten.

2514
02:48:49,064 --> 02:48:55,404
MATT: With that, your final dagger hits in the
side of its rib cage, and the creature slumps over

2515
02:48:55,404 --> 02:49:00,823
on the ground, letting out a horrible, gurgling
hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud.

2516
02:49:00,823 --> 02:49:02,671
LIAM: Daredevil.

2517
02:49:02,671 --> 02:49:06,929
LAURA: Was that all of them?

2518
02:49:06,929 --> 02:49:09,691
MATT: Currently, yes. Make a perception check.

2519
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:18,676
LAURA: Okay. Oh, I roll with advantage, because
I'm in the forest! Oh my god, I rolled a one twice

2520
02:49:18,676 --> 02:49:21,980
in a fucking row. I see nothing.

2521
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:23,534
SAM: Two natural ones?

2522
02:49:23,534 --> 02:49:26,153
MARISHA: We are fucking eating it on rolls
tonight.

2523
02:49:26,153 --> 02:49:30,330
MATT: You're about to look down to inspect the
vicinity. However, the tree is starting to bow

2524
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:33,728
forward and you (grunt) have to catch yourself,
and you have no chance to even survey the

2525
02:49:33,728 --> 02:49:34,688
territory.

2526
02:49:34,688 --> 02:49:35,834
TALIESIN: Pine sap gets in your eye.

2527
02:49:35,834 --> 02:49:37,461
LIAM: Laura Bailey dies on stream.

2528
02:49:37,461 --> 02:49:38,955
TRAVIS: I rolled a 16.

2529
02:49:38,955 --> 02:49:46,402
MATT: As you take a moment, the rage still in, you
can hear the blood pumping in your ears, but you

2530
02:49:46,402 --> 02:49:52,794
also hear the (hiss) rising hissing, what sounds
like a distant echo coming up from a subterranean

2531
02:49:52,794 --> 02:49:53,807
tunnel.

2532
02:49:53,807 --> 02:49:55,067
LAURA: Oh no.

2533
02:49:55,067 --> 02:49:56,290
MARISHA: Subterranean tunnel?

2534
02:49:56,290 --> 02:50:00,227
TRAVIS: Yeah. That Fireball, I think it might have
pissed them off.

2535
02:50:00,227 --> 02:50:01,529
SAM: Good.

2536
02:50:01,529 --> 02:50:07,611
MARISHA: Can I use my blindsight tremorsense to
see if I can feel how far away they are?

2537
02:50:07,611 --> 02:50:12,261
MATT: You do. You feel beneath the ground. It's
less of a tremorsense, more being able to sense

2538
02:50:12,261 --> 02:50:17,805
the vibrations in the air around you. You can tell
that there is motion coming from underneath.

2539
02:50:17,805 --> 02:50:19,599
MARISHA: Sounds like a lot of them?

2540
02:50:19,599 --> 02:50:21,103
MATT: A few more.

2541
02:50:21,103 --> 02:50:23,647
ASHLEY: Fireball the other holes?

2542
02:50:23,647 --> 02:50:28,828
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my scorpion form.

2543
02:50:28,828 --> 02:50:33,943
SAM: Oh, god, Keyleth, you're horrible! Oh, wait,
no, you've turned back to normal.

2544
02:50:33,943 --> 02:50:41,432
MARISHA: The things you say, Scanlan. I'm just
going to do a Wall of Stone, flat over the area

2545
02:50:41,432 --> 02:50:42,827
with the holes.

2546
02:50:42,827 --> 02:50:50,687
MATT: So from the stone chunks and portions of the
shattered bodies that litter part of this garden,

2547
02:50:50,687 --> 02:50:59,762
a giant stone wall forms around them and builds
over it, sealing these holes. Eventually you hear

2548
02:50:59,762 --> 02:51:04,563
a (knocking) (reptilian snarl) scraping sounds.

2549
02:51:04,563 --> 02:51:07,354
SAM: They're friendly!

2550
02:51:07,354 --> 02:51:10,007
LIAM: "I can't breathe down here!"

2551
02:51:10,007 --> 02:51:15,137
MATT: They're not budging it, they're just hitting
it from underneath, and it's getting more frantic

2552
02:51:15,137 --> 02:51:16,531
as time goes on.

2553
02:51:16,531 --> 02:51:19,368
SAM: How long can you hold that?

2554
02:51:19,368 --> 02:51:25,566
MARISHA: It'll last until they bust out of it, so
we either keep moving or figure out where we're

2555
02:51:25,566 --> 02:51:26,693
going from here.

2556
02:51:26,693 --> 02:51:29,904
SAM: What is this obelisk? It seems important if
these things are protecting it.

2557
02:51:29,904 --> 02:51:30,925
LAURA: What does it say?

2558
02:51:30,925 --> 02:51:32,373
MARISHA: It has writing in Elvish in it.

2559
02:51:32,373 --> 02:51:33,398
SAM: What does it say?

2560
02:51:33,398 --> 02:51:37,211
MARISHA: It says, a name is earned, in Elvish.

2561
02:51:37,211 --> 02:51:42,537
SAM: Should we say a name to it and see what
happens?

2562
02:51:42,537 --> 02:51:46,488
MATT: One of the stone parts of the wall begins to
crack from underneath.

2563
02:51:46,488 --> 02:51:52,959
LAURA: Didn't Osysa say something about, her mate
wouldn't say its name?

2564
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:54,208
SAM: That's right, that's right.

2565
02:51:54,208 --> 02:51:57,242
LAURA: And this is a symbol of Ioun.

2566
02:51:57,242 --> 02:52:01,008
TRAVIS: Should we say Ioun in Elvish?

2567
02:52:01,008 --> 02:52:02,930
MARISHA: I say Ioun in Elvish.

2568
02:52:02,930 --> 02:52:05,860
MATT: You say it out into the air.

2569
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:08,420
SAM: Why don't you say it into this triangle hole
over here?

2570
02:52:08,420 --> 02:52:10,292
MARISHA: Ioun!

2571
02:52:10,292 --> 02:52:12,294
LAURA: Say knowledge in Elvish.

2572
02:52:12,294 --> 02:52:14,049
MARISHA: Knowledge!

2573
02:52:14,049 --> 02:52:18,240
SAM: Elvish is just English except muffled.

2574
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:21,150
MARISHA: I'm going in the triangle hole!

2575
02:52:21,150 --> 02:52:24,165
MATT: A moment passes.

2576
02:52:24,165 --> 02:52:28,342
MARISHA: Osysa! Sphinx!

2577
02:52:28,342 --> 02:52:30,146
LAURA: A name is earned.

2578
02:52:30,146 --> 02:52:32,643
TRAVIS: What's in the hole?

2579
02:52:32,643 --> 02:52:34,459
MARISHA: What's in the hole?

2580
02:52:34,459 --> 02:52:37,569
SAM: I don't know what's in the hole. Nothing.

2581
02:52:37,569 --> 02:52:40,581
MATT: A basilisk face bursts through the stone
wall.

2582
02:52:40,581 --> 02:52:42,547
SAM: Whack-a-Mole! Grog! Whack-a-Mole!

2583
02:52:42,547 --> 02:52:44,391
TRAVIS: Can I run over and play golf?

2584
02:52:44,391 --> 02:52:47,179
MATT: Yeah. Do you want to avert your gaze or
not?

2585
02:52:47,179 --> 02:52:48,429
TRAVIS: Nah.

2586
02:52:48,429 --> 02:52:50,410
MATT: All right, I need you to make a constitution
saving throw.

2587
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:54,406
LIAM: Shite.

2588
02:52:54,406 --> 02:52:55,762
TRAVIS: 22.

2589
02:52:55,762 --> 02:53:01,376
MATT: Without an issue, the eyes find yours and
you just grin as you bring... what kind of attacks

2590
02:53:01,376 --> 02:53:02,649
do you want to do?

2591
02:53:02,649 --> 02:53:05,000
TRAVIS: Reckless and Great Weapon Master.

2592
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,264
MATT: All right, go for it.

2593
02:53:06,264 --> 02:53:10,419
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20. I'll take that one on
the first one.

2594
02:53:10,419 --> 02:53:12,397
MATT: Okay, and the other one?

2595
02:53:12,397 --> 02:53:18,580
TRAVIS: 19. 20.

2596
02:53:18,580 --> 02:53:28,998
MATT: Both hit. The first is a critical. This
would be over here.

2597
02:53:28,998 --> 02:53:32,469
TRAVIS: 31?

2598
02:53:32,469 --> 02:53:35,017
MATT: Did you roll the... Is that times two?

2599
02:53:35,017 --> 02:53:37,070
TRAVIS: No, that's just the attack.

2600
02:53:37,070 --> 02:53:38,269
LIAM: It's critical.

2601
02:53:38,269 --> 02:53:39,567
MATT: Before you add your modifier.

2602
02:53:39,567 --> 02:53:46,767
TRAVIS: Before the modifier? It was 12 before the
modifier.

2603
02:53:46,767 --> 02:53:49,160
MATT: So 24 plus the modifier.

2604
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:55,852
TRAVIS: Which is 32, plus ten is 42.

2605
02:53:55,852 --> 02:53:59,888
MATT: 42. Did you roll the additional brutal
critical rolls?

2606
02:53:59,888 --> 02:54:01,103
TRAVIS: Nope.

2607
02:54:01,103 --> 02:54:07,053
MATT: So roll 4d6 on top of that, because of your
brutal critical. I think it is.

2608
02:54:07,053 --> 02:54:10,196
LIAM: I think we can all agree it's the jelly of
the month club at this point.

2609
02:54:10,196 --> 02:54:11,644
TRAVIS: 17.

2610
02:54:11,644 --> 02:54:15,173
MATT: For a grand total of...

2611
02:54:15,173 --> 02:54:18,378
SAM: 59?

2612
02:54:18,378 --> 02:54:21,722
LAURA: Do you double those ones though, because
it's the dice?

2613
02:54:21,722 --> 02:54:25,198
TRAVIS: That's just the first hit.

2614
02:54:25,198 --> 02:54:30,740
MATT: Yeah, all right. 59 points of damage. You
square up.

2615
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:32,944
TRAVIS: Happy Gilmore-style.

2616
02:54:32,944 --> 02:54:39,152
MATT: You strike down with the blade at an angle,
using the stone holding it in place like an

2617
02:54:39,152 --> 02:54:44,688
executioner's block, and the blade scrapes against
the stone as you strike, finding itself embedding

2618
02:54:44,688 --> 02:54:49,717
about seven to eight inches into the throat of the
basilisk as its head's protruding out.

2619
02:54:49,717 --> 02:54:55,973
Immediately, blood begins to pour out of its side,
and it's gurgling at its attempt to try and push

2620
02:54:55,973 --> 02:55:00,931
through. You wedge the blade out. Go for your next
strike. You already rolled your attack, which was

2621
02:55:00,931 --> 02:55:02,895
a 19, so roll damage on that one.

2622
02:55:02,895 --> 02:55:08,673
TRAVIS: Seven, 12, 20, 30, on the second one.

2623
02:55:08,673 --> 02:55:10,071
LIAM: Oh, that's all?

2624
02:55:10,071 --> 02:55:18,815
MATT: With the second strike, you (whoosh) clean
slice. The head (splat) onto the stonework there,

2625
02:55:18,815 --> 02:55:24,985
the body still wedging the hole shut. The neck is
a clean cut, and starts gouting blood out.

2626
02:55:24,985 --> 02:55:28,480
TRAVIS: I dip the tip of the sword into the little
well and I pick up the head.

2627
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:31,759
MATT: Which, by the way, both saving throws were
failed, so you gain another plus two to strength.

2628
02:55:31,759 --> 02:55:36,155
SAM: Wow, you're catching up to Pike!

2629
02:55:36,155 --> 02:55:43,168
LAURA: Ow! Nothing.

2630
02:55:43,168 --> 02:55:45,235
TALIESIN: Did you cut yourself on your cup?

2631
02:55:45,235 --> 02:55:46,640
LAURA: No, I just hit my tooth.

2632
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:48,389
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh, I hate that.

2633
02:55:48,389 --> 02:55:52,583
MATT: All right, so you can feel the impact still
attempting from beneath growing more and more

2634
02:55:52,583 --> 02:55:53,935
frantic.

2635
02:55:53,935 --> 02:55:55,400
MARISHA: I say, earned!

2636
02:55:55,400 --> 02:56:05,243
ASHLEY: Can I go collect some of the (stuttering)
basilisk-- I can't say that. Can I get some of the

2637
02:56:05,243 --> 02:56:06,822
blood and collect it?

2638
02:56:06,822 --> 02:56:11,132
MATT: Sure. And you notice that the longer it
stays out there, the blood itself is beginning to

2639
02:56:11,132 --> 02:56:13,977
freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy.

2640
02:56:13,977 --> 02:56:17,290
LAURA: We can get some and put it in my bag. It
keeps things good.

2641
02:56:17,290 --> 02:56:23,340
ASHLEY: Can I stab the carcass then in another
area and get some fresh in the body?

2642
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:27,694
MATT: Yeah, there's plenty of carcasses of
basilisks around. As they're inspecting, and you

2643
02:56:27,694 --> 02:56:33,018
still feel the impacts from underneath the stone
wall from the other tunnel, you manage to gather,

2644
02:56:33,018 --> 02:56:35,888
we'll say two small vials of basilisk blood.

2645
02:56:35,888 --> 02:56:39,886
ASHLEY: Vex!

2646
02:56:39,886 --> 02:56:43,068
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it in Vex's little refrigerator
Bag of Holding.

2647
02:56:43,068 --> 02:56:54,290
MATT: Okay. The slamming on the other side of the
stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes.

2648
02:56:54,290 --> 02:56:58,201
MARISHA: Did they give up?

2649
02:56:58,201 --> 02:57:00,314
TRAVIS: Has anybody put their hand in the hole
yet?

2650
02:57:00,314 --> 02:57:01,456
LAURA: It's all you, Grog.

2651
02:57:01,456 --> 02:57:02,780
TRAVIS: All right, I put my hand in the hole.

2652
02:57:02,780 --> 02:57:03,953
MATT: Where the one you killed is?

2653
02:57:03,953 --> 02:57:05,029
TRAVIS: No, the triangle.

2654
02:57:05,029 --> 02:57:11,976
MATT: Okay. So you take your hand and you place it
inside this empty recess in the obelisk. It

2655
02:57:11,976 --> 02:57:19,886
reaches in, and the shadow of the obelisk
completely takes it to the wrist.

2656
02:57:19,886 --> 02:57:21,788
Nothing happens.

2657
02:57:21,788 --> 02:57:30,033
SAM: I'm going to take my Ioun Stone and shove it
in the hole.

2658
02:57:30,033 --> 02:57:36,996
MATT: Okay. You take the Ioun Stone and place it
in the hole, and it has a soft light that it gives

2659
02:57:36,996 --> 02:57:44,069
off naturally from the magical enchantment, and it
lights the inside of the dark recess, and as you

2660
02:57:44,069 --> 02:57:51,362
place it inside, the top of the obelisk begins to
glow ever-so-faintly, like a little beacon. The

2661
02:57:51,362 --> 02:57:54,502
very top of the stone glows a matching color to
your stone.

2662
02:57:54,502 --> 02:57:56,378
MARISHA: A matching color?

2663
02:57:56,378 --> 02:58:00,917
MATT: Yeah. I need you all to make a perception
check.

2664
02:58:00,917 --> 02:58:04,972
SAM: 17.

2665
02:58:04,972 --> 02:58:06,904
MARISHA: 14.

2666
02:58:06,904 --> 02:58:08,270
LIAM: 16.

2667
02:58:08,270 --> 02:58:09,487
TRAVIS: 19!

2668
02:58:09,487 --> 02:58:10,572
LAURA: 25.

2669
02:58:10,572 --> 02:58:13,250
TALIESIN: 11.

2670
02:58:13,250 --> 02:58:14,836
SAM: Ashley Blindsight?

2671
02:58:14,836 --> 02:58:15,946
ASHLEY: 16!

2672
02:58:15,946 --> 02:58:23,048
MATT: Okay. You catch a little bit of this, Grog,
and you perk up as you notice, and you see

2673
02:58:23,048 --> 02:58:31,871
immediately. There is a matching beacon, a faint
glow that appears to be streaking down the

2674
02:58:31,871 --> 02:58:37,126
mountainside in the distance. It's a little bit
off-center from the direct south direction that

2675
02:58:37,126 --> 02:58:44,886
you're facing, but there is a slight marker, very
faintly visible on the mountain range, just

2676
02:58:44,886 --> 02:58:47,425
visible over the treetops.

2677
02:58:47,425 --> 02:58:52,893
LAURA: I drop a pin in that, and I tell Keyleth,
now you can use that thing!

2678
02:58:52,893 --> 02:58:56,725
MARISHA: I hold up the Hunk of Quall.

2679
02:58:56,725 --> 02:59:04,363
LAURA: No, I mean your spell, Keyleth. Fastest way
to get to this point!

2680
02:59:04,363 --> 02:59:09,029
MARISHA: I didn't bring it because everyone said
not to learn that spell.

2681
02:59:09,029 --> 02:59:11,159
SAM: That was today, wasn't it?

2682
02:59:11,159 --> 02:59:12,522
LAURA: I thought you already learned it.

2683
02:59:12,522 --> 02:59:16,916
MARISHA: He said to learn something else because
it wasn't going to be useful.

2684
02:59:16,916 --> 02:59:18,955
LAURA: No, he said just don't use that thing!

2685
02:59:18,955 --> 02:59:22,803
MARISHA: No, you said to learn something, it was
at the beginning of the day!

2686
02:59:22,803 --> 02:59:27,722
SAM: You can't unlearn things! It's all good.

2687
02:59:27,722 --> 02:59:30,268
LAURA: It's okay, it's okay. I can see it.

2688
02:59:30,268 --> 02:59:36,685
MATT: You had it already memorized when you guys
got to the edge of the forest, I'm pretty sure.

2689
02:59:36,685 --> 02:59:42,017
MARISHA: Okay. I thought you were saying to pick
something else because it wouldn't be handy. But I

2690
02:59:42,017 --> 02:59:47,725
take it back, and I'll use it now if you want.

2691
02:59:47,725 --> 02:59:49,697
TALIESIN: No, we're good. We're good.

2692
02:59:49,697 --> 02:59:52,076
MARISHA: I'm so confused.

2693
02:59:52,076 --> 02:59:53,173
MATT: Up to you.

2694
02:59:53,173 --> 02:59:54,688
MARISHA: Is it me tonight?

2695
02:59:54,688 --> 02:59:58,433
TALIESIN: It is a really weird pot of coffee. It's
not just you.

2696
02:59:58,433 --> 03:00:01,116
MARISHA: Do I need sleep? What am I missing?

2697
03:00:01,116 --> 03:00:02,575
MATT: It's all good.

2698
03:00:02,575 --> 03:00:06,296
MARISHA: I can keep it.

2699
03:00:06,296 --> 03:00:08,773
TRAVIS: Just lick your finger and stick it in the
wind.

2700
03:00:08,773 --> 03:00:11,812
LAURA: Just use the spell and pretend that you
never unlearned it.

2701
03:00:11,812 --> 03:00:16,979
MARISHA: I never unlearned it! It's been there the
whole time! I didn't use it. It's not like I used

2702
03:00:16,979 --> 03:00:23,037
a 6th-level spell. Look, guys! Find the Path! That
way!

2703
03:00:23,037 --> 03:00:28,458
MATT: Okay. So what is it that you're focusing on
for the spell?

2704
03:00:28,458 --> 03:00:32,820
MARISHA: That beam of light!

2705
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:34,639
LAURA: That I pointed out to her.

2706
03:00:34,639 --> 03:00:38,197
MARISHA: That she pointed out. Am I doing this
wrong?

2707
03:00:38,197 --> 03:00:43,948
MATT: No, you're not doing it wrong! You cast the
spell and, concentrating on the source of this

2708
03:00:43,948 --> 03:00:49,925
beacon, you feel the direction that would pull you
the best way to travel towards that beacon is to

2709
03:00:49,925 --> 03:00:52,406
travel towards that beacon.

2710
03:00:52,406 --> 03:00:55,568
LIAM: Look, you're just doing what the bossy
half-elf told you to do. Just go with it.

2711
03:00:55,568 --> 03:00:57,734
MARISHA: What, that one?

2712
03:00:57,734 --> 03:01:00,052
LIAM: That's the only bossy half-elf here.

2713
03:01:00,052 --> 03:01:07,470
SAM: DM, can I experiment and take away, if I take
away my Ioun Stone, does the light fade?

2714
03:01:07,470 --> 03:01:13,528
MATT: As you pull the Ioun Stone out of it, the
beacon does fade, yes. But you have a direction.

2715
03:01:13,528 --> 03:01:19,078
MARISHA: I have it marked now. I have a pin in it.
Right, that counts?

2716
03:01:19,078 --> 03:01:24,114
MATT: Right. No matter where you travel in this
place, you will have a directional position

2717
03:01:24,114 --> 03:01:25,284
towards that beacon.

2718
03:01:25,284 --> 03:01:26,335
LAURA: See, there we go.

2719
03:01:26,335 --> 03:01:27,845
MARISHA: Fucking handy, that one is.

2720
03:01:27,845 --> 03:01:28,999
TRAVIS: Yep, redemption.

2721
03:01:28,999 --> 03:01:34,474
MARISHA: Totally a great 6th-level spell I'm going
to use all the time going forward.

2722
03:01:34,474 --> 03:01:38,475
LIAM: Oh, for fuck's sake. Here we go, people.
Here we go. And we're moving.

2723
03:01:38,475 --> 03:01:40,266
TRAVIS: We take off at a jog now!

2724
03:01:40,266 --> 03:01:45,121
SAM: Wait, before we leave, is there anything else
we need to do here? Do we need to go down into the

2725
03:01:45,121 --> 03:01:48,089
tunnels? Do we need to piss on the obelisk? Do we
want to do anything?

2726
03:01:48,089 --> 03:01:50,764
LIAM: You should piss on the obelisk just to be
sure.

2727
03:01:50,764 --> 03:01:52,653
TALIESIN: You should lick it, too, after you piss
on it.

2728
03:01:52,653 --> 03:01:53,690
TRAVIS: Let's not.

2729
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:54,936
SAM: Let's go.

2730
03:01:54,936 --> 03:01:56,197
MATT: Are you guys leaving?

2731
03:01:56,197 --> 03:01:58,809
SAM: Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff!

2732
03:01:58,809 --> 03:02:00,764
LAURA: We got some!

2733
03:02:00,764 --> 03:02:06,642
MATT: You're standing amongst the obelisk, a long
series of mud with a bunch of mostly together

2734
03:02:06,642 --> 03:02:09,964
stone statues of people and pieces of people
around.

2735
03:02:09,964 --> 03:02:15,726
TRAVIS: Do we want to check the other building
ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a

2736
03:02:15,726 --> 03:02:17,813
whole corner of a building over there.

2737
03:02:17,813 --> 03:02:19,224
LAURA: Sure.

2738
03:02:19,224 --> 03:02:20,742
TRAVIS: Well, go check it!

2739
03:02:20,742 --> 03:02:22,102
LAURA: I go look at it.

2740
03:02:22,102 --> 03:02:24,309
LIAM: Half-elves look at the building structure.

2741
03:02:24,309 --> 03:02:25,669
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2742
03:02:25,669 --> 03:02:27,807
TRAVIS: What the hot holy fuck.

2743
03:02:27,807 --> 03:02:30,524
LIAM: 26.

2744
03:02:30,524 --> 03:02:34,839
TALIESIN: It says it was forged by dwarves, that's
all I can understand.

2745
03:02:34,839 --> 03:02:36,124
LAURA: Investigation?

2746
03:02:36,124 --> 03:02:38,450
MATT: Investigation, yeah.

2747
03:02:38,450 --> 03:02:39,378
LAURA: 19.

2748
03:02:39,378 --> 03:02:45,217
MATT: 19, all right. You guys both start gathering
around the sides of the ruin. Glancing about the

2749
03:02:45,217 --> 03:02:49,451
outside, it looks like at one point it was a
smaller structure, probably part of the

2750
03:02:49,451 --> 03:02:57,581
construction, like this here was a satellite place
of worship for Ioun, like a beacon as part of a

2751
03:02:57,581 --> 03:03:06,975
journey. But nothing about it catches your eyes.
As you're stepping over the remnants of the stone

2752
03:03:06,975 --> 03:03:14,646
individuals on the ground, you catch your eye on
one of the individuals you see, lying partially

2753
03:03:14,646 --> 03:03:22,180
submerged in the snow and mud. You glance down and
see two arms that are out like this, although the

2754
03:03:22,180 --> 03:03:27,034
right arm from the elbow down is missing. It's
broken off in stone. Both are reaching out. A

2755
03:03:27,034 --> 03:03:36,579
young human male, shortish brown hair, spectacles
at the end of his nose, thin body and tucked-in,

2756
03:03:36,579 --> 03:03:43,979
nice buttoned shirt. Slacks. This is Tyriok, the
mapmaker.

2757
03:03:43,979 --> 03:03:46,286
LIAM: The <i>mapmaker</i>?

2758
03:03:46,286 --> 03:03:47,570
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person.

2759
03:03:47,570 --> 03:03:49,445
LAURA: No, why would you do that, Matthew?

2760
03:03:49,445 --> 03:03:54,477
MATT: I didn't do this! He was travelling the
world to take notes, people!

2761
03:03:54,477 --> 03:04:02,365
LIAM: I take... Wait! Everybody shush! I look at
him for a moment and then I leave him, and I don't

2762
03:04:02,365 --> 03:04:04,051
tell anyone else.

2763
03:04:04,051 --> 03:04:05,369
MARISHA: What?

2764
03:04:05,369 --> 03:04:06,719
SAM: We have Pike with us!

2765
03:04:06,719 --> 03:04:13,179
LIAM: I don't tell anyone else. Pike didn't see
him. His arm is broken off! You don't fucking know

2766
03:04:13,179 --> 03:04:15,149
he exists. He's gone.

2767
03:04:15,149 --> 03:04:16,479
ASHLEY: But, but!

2768
03:04:16,479 --> 03:04:19,332
LAURA: That's terrible!

2769
03:04:19,332 --> 03:04:23,389
TALIESIN: Why don't you two just write a sequel to
Batman/Superman while you're at it? Just destroy

2770
03:04:23,389 --> 03:04:25,882
everything. I don't care anymore.

2771
03:04:25,882 --> 03:04:27,300
LAURA: We could heal him!

2772
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:34,988
MATT: You don't know. Eventually, after you guys
do a perusal of the ruins, you find your way back

2773
03:04:34,988 --> 03:04:38,128
to the party and you guys continue travelling
which way, towards the beacon?

2774
03:04:38,128 --> 03:04:39,184
LAURA: Towards the beacon!

2775
03:04:39,184 --> 03:04:40,803
MARISHA: I've got it in my head now.

2776
03:04:40,803 --> 03:04:46,641
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, I go to Pike. I go to
Pike. Pike.

2777
03:04:46,641 --> 03:04:50,423
ASHLEY: Yeah? Hi, Vax!

2778
03:04:50,423 --> 03:04:58,515
LIAM: Do you remember that mapmaker? Were you with
us? So much shit has happened. Do you remember

2779
03:04:58,515 --> 03:04:59,883
Tyriok the mapmaker?

2780
03:04:59,883 --> 03:05:03,023
ASHLEY: I don't think I was with you.

2781
03:05:03,023 --> 03:05:13,725
LIAM: There's a man over there. His arm is gone.
Can you fix stoning? Can you fix a man who's been

2782
03:05:13,725 --> 03:05:15,410
turned to stone?

2783
03:05:15,410 --> 03:05:26,621
ASHLEY: I can try. Remember one time we fixed Vex,
when she was turned to stone, the last time we

2784
03:05:26,621 --> 03:05:29,071
fought the basilisks.

2785
03:05:29,071 --> 03:05:31,311
LIAM: Two years ago, yeah. What did we do?

2786
03:05:31,311 --> 03:05:35,008
ASHLEY: We covered her in basilisk blood.

2787
03:05:35,008 --> 03:05:41,246
LIAM: I need to take a walk. Could you do that?
Could you do that?

2788
03:05:41,246 --> 03:05:43,887
ASHLEY: Sure. Which stone is he?

2789
03:05:43,887 --> 03:05:49,990
LIAM: Look over there by that tree there. Do you
see him? There's two hands pointing towards the sky.

2790
03:05:49,990 --> 03:05:51,335
SAM: One hand.

2791
03:05:51,335 --> 03:05:52,307
LIAM: Two.

2792
03:05:52,307 --> 03:05:59,257
ASHLEY: One and a half. All right, can I head over
there?

2793
03:05:59,257 --> 03:06:05,804
MATT: You walk over there, and you do see a number
of broken body parts all turned to stone in

2794
03:06:05,804 --> 03:06:12,307
various states of disuse and crumbling. You do see
a young man who's caught with his arms out, one

2795
03:06:12,307 --> 03:06:18,474
broken off at the elbow, staring up, glasses at
the end of his nose, looking both frightened and

2796
03:06:18,474 --> 03:06:22,356
frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger.

2797
03:06:22,356 --> 03:06:28,536
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I try covering him in some of
the basilisk's blood?

2798
03:06:28,536 --> 03:06:33,188
MATT: Sure. You take one of the vials that you
collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it

2799
03:06:33,188 --> 03:06:39,919
over the statue. The blood congeals and spills
over, crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to

2800
03:06:39,919 --> 03:06:43,677
it. It doesn't seem to have an effect.

2801
03:06:43,677 --> 03:06:45,800
ASHLEY: It's been too long.

2802
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:51,212
MATT: You gather, based on the last time it
happened, the blood needs to be applied within a

2803
03:06:51,212 --> 03:06:57,687
short period of time after the person turns to
stone. Do you have anything else that might help?

2804
03:06:57,687 --> 03:07:00,326
ASHLEY: Probably Greater Restoration.

2805
03:07:00,326 --> 03:07:01,888
MATT: Do you have that prepared?

2806
03:07:01,888 --> 03:07:03,043
ASHLEY: I do.

2807
03:07:03,043 --> 03:07:08,108
MATT: You concentrate, grasping the symbol of
Sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out.

2808
03:07:08,108 --> 03:07:13,348
The warm glow of Sarenrae's divine energy
transferring into the stone form. The form glows

2809
03:07:13,348 --> 03:07:22,240
with energy, and the glow subsides and fades, the
stone texture of his body beginning to slowly

2810
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:28,978
soften, and the color returning to his skin, and
for a moment the head seems to shake, and the eyes

2811
03:07:28,978 --> 03:07:36,646
clarify, and a voice begins to peek through these
previously frozen vocal cords. "I mean no--"

2812
03:07:36,646 --> 03:07:43,105
(screams) As all of a sudden his arm begins to
spray gouts of blood.

2813
03:07:43,105 --> 03:07:47,247
TRAVIS: I got it! I got it! I start catching it
with the sword.

2814
03:07:47,247 --> 03:07:55,698
MATT: (stuttering) He turns to you, and sprays
right across your face.

2815
03:07:55,698 --> 03:07:57,719
TRAVIS: Good! Splash on! Yes!

2816
03:07:57,719 --> 03:08:00,067
MATT: "Help! Help me!"

2817
03:08:00,067 --> 03:08:07,993
ASHLEY: I grab his arm and Cure Wounds! I don't
know if that's a really good move.

2818
03:08:07,993 --> 03:08:11,026
MATT: Go ahead and heal him up a bit.

2819
03:08:11,026 --> 03:08:12,646
ASHLEY: Can I try to reattach his arm?

2820
03:08:12,646 --> 03:08:18,562
MATT: You gather that might have been something to
do before you had restored him.

2821
03:08:18,562 --> 03:08:25,409
SAM: Oh, shit.

2822
03:08:25,409 --> 03:08:28,318
MATT: However, go ahead and heal for Cure Wounds.
Roll a d8 plus five.

2823
03:08:28,318 --> 03:08:30,890
TRAVIS: That's kind of fucking hilarious.

2824
03:08:30,890 --> 03:08:35,290
ASHLEY: 5d8 plus five?

2825
03:08:35,290 --> 03:08:38,744
MATT: Depending on what level you want to use on
him. A level one is 1d8 plus five.

2826
03:08:38,744 --> 03:08:44,499
ASHLEY: Oh, God, okay. I feel like I'm using all
this, but I don't know. Okay, so let's do level five.

2827
03:08:44,499 --> 03:08:48,313
MATT: Level five. All right, go for it. 5d8 plus
five.

2828
03:08:48,313 --> 03:08:57,989
TALIESIN: Not our finest hour. Pretty reasonable
hour, but it's definitely not the finest. We

2829
03:08:57,989 --> 03:09:00,079
brought most of a mapmaker back.

2830
03:09:00,079 --> 03:09:06,334
MATT: So how much is that?

2831
03:09:06,334 --> 03:09:09,311
ASHLEY: 29.

2832
03:09:09,311 --> 03:09:13,879
MATT: 29, okay. As you reach out and grasp the
edge of his bleeding stump...

2833
03:09:13,879 --> 03:09:15,343
ASHLEY: Stop moving!

2834
03:09:15,343 --> 03:09:21,093
MATT: "I just--" (yelps) The warmth causes the
pain to fade and he calms for a second. "Oh.

2835
03:09:21,093 --> 03:09:30,729
"Sorry." He looks down as the wound has stopped
bleeding, skin is scabbed over, and it looks like

2836
03:09:30,729 --> 03:09:35,927
it's now in a place where it's no longer an open
wound. It is mostly healed over, though he is now

2837
03:09:35,927 --> 03:09:37,782
missing part of his arm.

2838
03:09:37,782 --> 03:09:42,334
LAURA: Can you regrow his little arm like you
regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe?

2839
03:09:42,334 --> 03:09:46,958
MATT: This is a bit beyond your healing
capabilities.

2840
03:09:46,958 --> 03:09:48,895
TRAVIS: C'mon, Deadpool hand.

2841
03:09:48,895 --> 03:09:57,808
MATT: At which point he goes, "Thank you, small
one. I--" And he goes to reach up for his glasses

2842
03:09:57,808 --> 03:10:00,806
and... Other hand.

2843
03:10:00,806 --> 03:10:02,569
LAURA: Oh, we're terrible.

2844
03:10:02,569 --> 03:10:06,507
TALIESIN: Technically saved seven-eighths of a
mapmaker.

2845
03:10:06,507 --> 03:10:14,293
MATT: He looks around at the rest of you. "Oh!
Hello, it's been a while. We haven't... Well, I

2846
03:10:14,293 --> 03:10:16,659
"seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a
predicament."

2847
03:10:16,659 --> 03:10:18,247
SAM: What happened?

2848
03:10:18,247 --> 03:10:26,428
MATT: "Well, I was... Well, I had two escorts. And
I had been making my way through most of

2849
03:10:26,428 --> 03:10:34,107
"Tal'Dorei, and had gotten as far as this region,
and... That's all I remember."

2850
03:10:34,107 --> 03:10:37,718
LAURA: Basilisks? Big lizard creatures?

2851
03:10:37,718 --> 03:10:44,254
MATT: "Yes. Very scary. I tried to run, and that's
all I remember."

2852
03:10:44,254 --> 03:10:46,809
LAURA: Was it just the three of you, then? Not a
large group of people?

2853
03:10:46,809 --> 03:10:48,129
MATT: "No, just three of us."

2854
03:10:48,129 --> 03:10:49,667
ASHLEY: What were you doing over here?

2855
03:10:49,667 --> 03:10:57,137
MATT: "I was trying to finish this portion of the
map. If I... Ah!" And he goes over and reaches

2856
03:10:57,137 --> 03:11:05,685
through some of the snow and pulls up a large
stone bag that is currently still attached to his

2857
03:11:05,685 --> 03:11:07,446
broken arm.

2858
03:11:07,446 --> 03:11:08,585
TALIESIN: No!

2859
03:11:08,585 --> 03:11:11,133
MATT: "Um. Is this...?"

2860
03:11:11,133 --> 03:11:15,606
TRAVIS: Nope! No, no, that's just part of a-- It
was a statue garden, it's not a big deal. It's

2861
03:11:15,606 --> 03:11:16,917
just a fragment.

2862
03:11:16,917 --> 03:11:20,424
MATT: "All right. Well, these were my maps."

2863
03:11:20,424 --> 03:11:22,065
SAM: Are they stone?

2864
03:11:22,065 --> 03:11:23,596
MATT: They are stone, currently.

2865
03:11:23,596 --> 03:11:24,990
LAURA: Can we-- Oh, no.

2866
03:11:24,990 --> 03:11:27,124
TRAVIS: Is he on the ground still?

2867
03:11:27,124 --> 03:11:35,458
MATT: No, he's standing. "Oh boy." He takes his
glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt

2868
03:11:35,458 --> 03:11:40,081
and... does it with one hand and puts them back
on.

2869
03:11:40,081 --> 03:11:41,490
ASHLEY: Oh, buddy.

2870
03:11:41,490 --> 03:11:42,991
LAURA: I feel terrible.

2871
03:11:42,991 --> 03:11:44,301
MATT: "Well."

2872
03:11:44,301 --> 03:11:46,078
TALIESIN: It's like a one-legged duck walking
around.

2873
03:11:46,078 --> 03:11:48,367
MATT: "What do I do?"

2874
03:11:48,367 --> 03:11:49,998
TRAVIS: Which hand does he have, his left?

2875
03:11:49,998 --> 03:11:50,985
MATT: He has his left hand.

2876
03:11:50,985 --> 03:11:52,359
TRAVIS: Are you right-handed?

2877
03:11:52,359 --> 03:11:53,913
MATT: "I'm kind of ambidextrous."

2878
03:11:53,913 --> 03:11:55,618
TRAVIS: Thank gods for that.

2879
03:11:55,618 --> 03:11:59,562
LAURA: That's good, that's good. Well...

2880
03:11:59,562 --> 03:12:01,735
TALIESIN: A lot's happened.

2881
03:12:01,735 --> 03:12:05,512
MATT: There's shock on his face. He still hasn't
quite taken in all of this stuff.

2882
03:12:05,512 --> 03:12:07,380
SAM: Everything is going to be okay.

2883
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:09,726
MARISHA: Well, you have a great story now.

2884
03:12:09,726 --> 03:12:11,772
TALIESIN: And a period of adjustment.

2885
03:12:11,772 --> 03:12:14,829
MATT: "This is very true. This is a valid point."

2886
03:12:14,829 --> 03:12:18,872
TALIESIN: We should send him back to the
encampment.

2887
03:12:18,872 --> 03:12:21,208
LAURA: It's like a two-day walk.

2888
03:12:21,208 --> 03:12:26,013
SAM: These escorts you had with you who were also
turned to stone, were they important to you? Were

2889
03:12:26,013 --> 03:12:27,720
they friends of yours?

2890
03:12:27,720 --> 03:12:34,986
MATT: "I hired them as part of this endeavor. They
were nice fellows. Hold on a second." He starts

2891
03:12:34,986 --> 03:12:39,279
walking off and starts rummaging through the
pieces of stone and various people, picking up

2892
03:12:39,279 --> 03:12:57,958
heads. "No. Well, that's Alex. Golly, I don't... I
don't know where Gerald is, but... Can I come with

2893
03:12:57,958 --> 03:12:59,173
"you for now?"

2894
03:12:59,173 --> 03:13:01,659
LAURA: Well, you're more than-- Actually--

2895
03:13:01,659 --> 03:13:02,792
TRAVIS: No.

2896
03:13:02,792 --> 03:13:04,497
LAURA: He's rather smart, isn't he?

2897
03:13:04,497 --> 03:13:06,829
SAM: He has knowledge of the area.

2898
03:13:06,829 --> 03:13:08,767
TALIESIN: That actually could be useful.

2899
03:13:08,767 --> 03:13:15,529
LAURA: Here's the thing. It's very dangerous,
dear, and it's quite possible you might be turned

2900
03:13:15,529 --> 03:13:16,659
into stone again.

2901
03:13:16,659 --> 03:13:17,995
MATT: "I don't want that."

2902
03:13:17,995 --> 03:13:20,020
LAURA: No, we don't want that for you, either.

2903
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:22,914
TRAVIS: Also eaten alive, burned, shot, stabbed--

2904
03:13:22,914 --> 03:13:24,020
LAURA: Straight-up killed.

2905
03:13:24,020 --> 03:13:25,248
TRAVIS: -- pulled apart, maimed--

2906
03:13:25,248 --> 03:13:26,276
LAURA: Beheaded.

2907
03:13:26,276 --> 03:13:27,210
TRAVIS: -- Lacerated.

2908
03:13:27,210 --> 03:13:28,317
LAURA: All options.

2909
03:13:28,317 --> 03:13:29,521
TRAVIS: But that's just in the mornings.

2910
03:13:29,521 --> 03:13:37,307
LAURA: But you're more than welcome to join us,
for a short amount of time. Or you can head back

2911
03:13:37,307 --> 03:13:40,679
to a camp that's about a day and a half away.

2912
03:13:40,679 --> 03:13:43,439
MATT: "All right. Whereabouts are you going?"

2913
03:13:43,439 --> 03:13:45,058
TRAVIS: We're heading up the mountain.

2914
03:13:45,058 --> 03:13:47,826
MATT: I'll head for the camp.

2915
03:13:47,826 --> 03:13:51,583
TRAVIS: Are you sure? We could always use you as a
decoy-- I mean, as an aid.

2916
03:13:51,583 --> 03:14:00,680
MATT: "I'm good. I'm all right. Thank you, though.
I appreciate the offer. I have a lot to think about."

2917
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:02,795
MARISHA: I could...

2918
03:14:02,795 --> 03:14:05,315
TALIESIN: Well, we'll run into him when we get
back.

2919
03:14:05,315 --> 03:14:07,872
TRAVIS: Do you need a hand finding your way to the
encampment?

2920
03:14:07,872 --> 03:14:09,058
SAM: Oh, Grog.

2921
03:14:09,058 --> 03:14:10,270
TALIESIN: Not cool.

2922
03:14:10,270 --> 03:14:13,996
LIAM: Groan.

2923
03:14:13,996 --> 03:14:18,499
MATT: He starts walking northward, basically
trailing past the path where you guys walked from.

2924
03:14:18,499 --> 03:14:22,107
LAURA: I feel like we should help him or
something.

2925
03:14:22,107 --> 03:14:25,504
LIAM: Not bad enough to actually do it, though,
right?

2926
03:14:25,504 --> 03:14:30,793
MARISHA: I have Conjure Woodland Beings in my back
pocket today, so I could conjure you a little

2927
03:14:30,793 --> 03:14:32,384
posse to escort you.

2928
03:14:32,384 --> 03:14:33,484
LAURA: That would be good!

2929
03:14:33,484 --> 03:14:35,038
LIAM: Have some squirrels, buddy.

2930
03:14:35,038 --> 03:14:37,267
MARISHA: Have a little posse.

2931
03:14:37,267 --> 03:14:38,892
MATT: What's the duration on that one?

2932
03:14:38,892 --> 03:14:42,642
MARISHA: I don't know. That's something else that
I haven't done, ever.

2933
03:14:42,642 --> 03:14:46,998
SAM: Untested high-level spell? Do it!

2934
03:14:46,998 --> 03:14:49,726
MARISHA: That always works so well.

2935
03:14:49,726 --> 03:14:51,797
MATT: It's an hour of concentration.

2936
03:14:51,797 --> 03:14:54,718
TRAVIS: Is this as far as you got, or did you make
it up the mountain previously?

2937
03:14:54,718 --> 03:14:58,632
MATT: "I was cresting through the base of the
mountain, and made it most of the way down the

2938
03:14:58,632 --> 03:15:00,694
"Stormcrest and was heading back through the
Frostweald."

2939
03:15:00,694 --> 03:15:02,199
TRAVIS: Oh, you've been up there already?

2940
03:15:02,199 --> 03:15:04,131
LAURA: You've been to the base of the Stormcrest
Mountains!

2941
03:15:04,131 --> 03:15:09,151
MATT: "I was kind of along the side. We were
trying to make our way through the central portion

2942
03:15:09,151 --> 03:15:14,793
"of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the
division of topography on both top and bottom."

2943
03:15:14,793 --> 03:15:19,001
TRAVIS: Oh, man. Why you didn't say so? We could
really use your help here.

2944
03:15:19,001 --> 03:15:27,984
LAURA: Actually, did you see something similar to
this obelisk at the base of the mountain?

2945
03:15:27,984 --> 03:15:34,489
MATT: "Uh..." He looks back and thinks to himself.
"Not quite like this, though, but there are a

2946
03:15:34,489 --> 03:15:39,474
"number of cavern entrances that litter various
portions of the base of the mountain."

2947
03:15:39,474 --> 03:15:41,128
TRAVIS: Did you go in any of them?

2948
03:15:41,128 --> 03:15:45,436
MATT: "No, see, I was afraid those would be too
dangerous. So I went into the forest."

2949
03:15:45,436 --> 03:15:46,656
TRAVIS: Right.

2950
03:15:46,656 --> 03:15:48,681
MATT: "Anyway."

2951
03:15:48,681 --> 03:15:52,311
TRAVIS: Well, look, you don't really seem to have
a lot on you. Why don't you join us for just a

2952
03:15:52,311 --> 03:15:57,064
little bit, to the areas that he knows, and then
we'll send you back on your way, maybe with a bit

2953
03:15:57,064 --> 03:16:00,568
of ale, a little bit of food? Maybe a weapon?

2954
03:16:00,568 --> 03:16:10,180
MATT: "That would be fantastic. And... Thank you.
I realize now that if you hadn't come by, I

2955
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:13,540
"probably would have been there forever."

2956
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:16,914
LAURA: Yes, well, we're sorry about the arm,
dear.

2957
03:16:16,914 --> 03:16:25,558
MATT: "There are worse things. And I can retrain
to write with this arm. It's totally fine."

2958
03:16:25,558 --> 03:16:33,251
SAM: Yes. You're lucky to be alive, and now you're
going on an adventure with us. Hey, who has two

2959
03:16:33,251 --> 03:16:38,515
thumbs and is really excited? You and me, both
doing this.

2960
03:16:38,515 --> 03:16:46,115
MATT: You know what, make a charisma check.

2961
03:16:46,115 --> 03:16:50,269
TALIESIN: You worry me.

2962
03:16:50,269 --> 03:16:51,504
SAM: Charisma?

2963
03:16:51,504 --> 03:16:53,611
MATT: Yeah, add your plus five charisma bonus.

2964
03:16:53,611 --> 03:16:57,130
SAM: 20.

2965
03:16:57,130 --> 03:17:06,591
MATT: 20? As you do that, he... "Yeah. You're
right! You're right. I'm thankful to be alive

2966
03:17:06,591 --> 03:17:09,275
"today, and it's because of you guys."

2967
03:17:09,275 --> 03:17:12,316
LIAM: Technically true.

2968
03:17:12,316 --> 03:17:14,382
MATT: "Let's travel!"

2969
03:17:14,382 --> 03:17:20,238
TRAVIS: Well, listen, I'll walk with you. Lead the
way.

2970
03:17:20,238 --> 03:17:25,298
MATT: "All right, so where are you going? Because
this place was dangerous, and that place is

2971
03:17:25,298 --> 03:17:27,704
"dangerous, and we don't want to go that way."

2972
03:17:27,704 --> 03:17:29,862
TRAVIS: Yeah, Vex'ahlia will point where we're
headed.

2973
03:17:29,862 --> 03:17:32,105
LAURA: Why don't you want to go that way? Have you
seen orcs in this wood?

2974
03:17:32,105 --> 03:17:35,890
MATT: He points and says, "There's a lot of them
that way. We came through here to avoid them, and

2975
03:17:35,890 --> 03:17:37,336
"that's when this all happened."

2976
03:17:37,336 --> 03:17:41,904
LAURA: Ooh. Actually, we should probably take care
of the orcs.

2977
03:17:41,904 --> 03:17:44,328
TALIESIN: Get the orcs really quick, and then we
can send him back with the refugees from there.

2978
03:17:44,328 --> 03:17:45,991
MARISHA: We did say we were going to take care of
the orcs.

2979
03:17:45,991 --> 03:17:46,928
LAURA: Yes, we did.

2980
03:17:46,928 --> 03:17:48,018
MARISHA: We did promise that.

2981
03:17:48,018 --> 03:17:49,909
LAURA: What do you say, Grog? Would you like to
kill some orc?

2982
03:17:49,909 --> 03:17:54,651
TRAVIS: Do you always ask questions to which you
know the answer already?

2983
03:17:54,651 --> 03:18:01,852
LAURA: Would you like to stay here while we fight
the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and

2984
03:18:01,852 --> 03:18:03,117
stay hidden?

2985
03:18:03,117 --> 03:18:04,706
MATT: "I don't want to stay here."

2986
03:18:04,706 --> 03:18:07,213
LAURA: Then you come with us, and then you stay
very, very hidden.

2987
03:18:07,213 --> 03:18:10,593
MATT: "I can do that. I can definitely do that."

2988
03:18:10,593 --> 03:18:19,583
TALIESIN: When it's time, he can hide with the
bear. Then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker,

2989
03:18:19,583 --> 03:18:21,110
or most of a mapmaker.

2990
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:22,733
SAM: We'll be fine. Let's go.

2991
03:18:22,733 --> 03:18:26,171
MATT: "All right."

2992
03:18:26,171 --> 03:18:31,682
LIAM: While all of that happened, for the last ten
minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit?

2993
03:18:31,682 --> 03:18:33,314
MATT: Sure. Roll a stealth check.

2994
03:18:33,314 --> 03:18:36,906
LIAM: 31.

2995
03:18:36,906 --> 03:18:39,629
MATT: Okay. Based on passive perception, nobody
notices your exit.

2996
03:18:39,629 --> 03:18:45,328
LIAM: I don't want to go that far, I want to go so
I can still hear all this bullshit behind me, and

2997
03:18:45,328 --> 03:18:48,886
find a quiet spot...

2998
03:18:48,886 --> 03:19:12,155
I know you can hear me. I'm going to need... I'm
going to need more than nightmares. A deal has

2999
03:19:12,155 --> 03:19:26,023
been struck, and I will honor it. I need to
understand what this is. Any time.

3000
03:19:26,023 --> 03:19:34,741
MATT: In that moment, the white snow suddenly
flashes to dark, and it's like you were struck

3001
03:19:34,741 --> 03:19:42,087
blind. You gasp instinctually as your vision goes
dark, nothing, and you see come from the shadow,

3002
03:19:42,087 --> 03:19:48,843
another flash, another vision. It's of Vasselheim.
Another flash. You look out and you can see

3003
03:19:48,843 --> 03:19:57,654
there's one large, darkened structure that you
have not visited but passed by on the southeastern

3004
03:19:57,654 --> 03:19:59,519
side of Vasselheim.

3005
03:19:59,519 --> 03:20:06,025
TALIESIN: Yeah! Temple! Temple of the Raven
Queen.

3006
03:20:06,025 --> 03:20:12,240
MATT: The actual name of this, and you've heard it
in passing before, when you were given your

3007
03:20:12,240 --> 03:20:26,055
initial pass over of the... I'm trying to find the
specific name here so I don't mess it up. It's in

3008
03:20:26,055 --> 03:20:33,954
here somewhere. You see this dark, obsidian
structure that is ridged, almost like an even rib

3009
03:20:33,954 --> 03:20:40,272
cage along each side. It is ominous, and it stuck
out in the middle of the city because, amongst the

3010
03:20:40,272 --> 03:20:48,004
rest of the jovial atmosphere, it loomed over the
Amaranthine Oubliette. But this was the central

3011
03:20:48,004 --> 03:20:55,678
temple to the Raven Queen. You then flash once
again, in a long chamber, and you see veils, dark

3012
03:20:55,678 --> 03:21:00,504
veils passing by, one after another, after
another. Another flash forward, and you see a

3013
03:21:00,504 --> 03:21:10,583
chamber with dark brown, smooth floors. You see
gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a

3014
03:21:10,583 --> 03:21:17,160
dome-type stained glass ceiling of amber colors
and white, and in the center of this chamber you

3015
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:28,293
see what appears to be a pool of still, crimson
liquid. You see the crimson liquid shift, and a

3016
03:21:28,293 --> 03:21:36,925
form rises up out of it. An arm rises up and
beckons a finger. Your vision goes to black, and

3017
03:21:36,925 --> 03:21:41,260
you're back in the forest.

3018
03:21:41,260 --> 03:21:57,329
LIAM: Fuck. Not exactly what I was talking about.
At some point, a little bit of clarification.

3019
03:21:57,329 --> 03:22:13,753
Congratulations, you're creepy as fuck. We'll work
it out. I head back to the group.

3020
03:22:13,753 --> 03:22:15,620
SAM: Good talk.

3021
03:22:15,620 --> 03:22:26,140
MATT: As you guys gather yourselves, your new
companion, and start heading in the direction that

3022
03:22:26,140 --> 03:22:30,828
he ushered you within the Frostweald, towards
where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made

3023
03:22:30,828 --> 03:22:38,857
their camp, you know that the good news is, you
probably have the element of surprise in this, but

3024
03:22:38,857 --> 03:22:43,047
you're not entirely sure what it is you're in for
when you get there.

3025
03:22:43,047 --> 03:22:45,619
That's where I'll end today's session.

3026
03:22:45,619 --> 03:22:48,638
(groaning)

3027
03:22:48,638 --> 03:22:57,063
LAURA: That was a lot of sidetracks on this
particular adventure.

3028
03:22:57,063 --> 03:22:59,099
MATT: That's all right. Sidetracks make it fun.

3029
03:22:59,099 --> 03:23:00,616
TALIESIN: Nothing wrong with sidetrack.

3030
03:23:00,616 --> 03:23:01,639
LIAM: Heebie-jeebies.

3031
03:23:01,639 --> 03:23:02,923
LAURA: Oh, man, she's creepy!

3032
03:23:02,923 --> 03:23:04,753
ASHLEY: Creepy as fuck!

3033
03:23:04,753 --> 03:23:06,524
LAURA: Creepy as fuck!

3034
03:23:06,524 --> 03:23:09,674
SAM: Hey, Pike, good job tonight, lady!

3035
03:23:09,674 --> 03:23:11,020
TRAVIS: Hey, Pikey!

3036
03:23:11,020 --> 03:23:14,318
SAM: You brought a guy back to life!

3037
03:23:14,318 --> 03:23:16,580
LAURA: 19 strength, say what!

3038
03:23:16,580 --> 03:23:18,191
SAM: You're super strong!

3039
03:23:18,191 --> 03:23:19,748
ASHLEY: I'm a tank.

3040
03:23:19,748 --> 03:23:21,835
TRAVIS: Tank up in this motherfucker.

3041
03:23:21,835 --> 03:23:26,389
LIAM: (bang! bang! bang!)

3042
03:23:26,389 --> 03:23:29,814
ASHLEY: It feels so good to be back.

3043
03:23:29,814 --> 03:23:32,322
MATT: I know. Come back to us soon! Physically!

3044
03:23:32,322 --> 03:23:33,513
LAURA: Yes, please!

3045
03:23:33,513 --> 03:23:36,013
ASHLEY: Yes, very soon! A few more weeks, a few
more weeks.

3046
03:23:36,013 --> 03:23:37,626
TRAVIS: She's coming, she's coming.

3047
03:23:37,626 --> 03:23:40,551
LIAM: We need our Pike.

3048
03:23:40,551 --> 03:23:47,677
MATT: All right, guys. We'll pick this up next
Thursday! Thank you for coming and watching us

3049
03:23:47,677 --> 03:23:49,873
play around, make believe on the Internet.

3050
03:23:49,873 --> 03:23:54,406
SAM: Is next week any-- It's not our 50th
episode?

3051
03:23:54,406 --> 03:23:55,718
LIAM: It's our 49th!

3052
03:23:55,718 --> 03:23:58,625
LAURA: Next week is our 49th, two weeks from now
is our 50th.

3053
03:23:58,625 --> 03:24:01,086
MATT: 21st is our 50th episode.

3054
03:24:01,086 --> 03:24:03,643
SAM: Last time in our 40s.

3055
03:24:03,643 --> 03:24:06,126
MARISHA: Got to enjoy it now.

3056
03:24:06,126 --> 03:24:07,654
TRAVIS: And don't miss the 50th.

3057
03:24:07,654 --> 03:24:09,364
MATT: Don't miss the 50th, it's going to be fun.

3058
03:24:09,364 --> 03:24:11,789
LAURA: May be a couple surprises in store.

3059
03:24:11,789 --> 03:24:15,593
MATT: We'll see.

3060
03:24:15,593 --> 03:24:17,360
TRAVIS: Nothing. Just us.

3061
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:19,427
MATT: I don't know where we'll be in the story,
because that's definitely based on whatever you

3062
03:24:19,427 --> 03:24:22,787
guys do. But we'll have some fun things here.

3063
03:24:22,787 --> 03:24:24,575
LIAM: Shopping episode.

3064
03:24:24,575 --> 03:24:31,081
MATT: Yep. But yeah, thank you guys so much! See
you next Thursday. Those of you in Pittsburgh,

3065
03:24:31,081 --> 03:24:37,562
we'll see you this weekend. Is it Thursday yet?
