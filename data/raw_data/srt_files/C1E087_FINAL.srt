1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,238
(no audio)

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,794
SAM: -- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of
science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years.

3
00:00:30,794 --> 00:00:38,585
That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic?
Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check

4
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:44,144
out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books.
The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light,

5
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:49,154
was just released, so check out the full
three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link

6
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,761
somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right
there. Let's say right there.

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,940
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure!

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,807
SAM: So check that out. And the thing about
sponsors, guys, is we really need to show them our

9
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:03,815
love. And really show them that we appreciate what
they do for us every week. They're a big part of

10
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:10,595
the show, without them we would-- For instance,
without sponsors,

11
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:14,587
Taliesin would only be able to
dye his hair platinum blond or brown.

12
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:15,520
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,359
MARISHA: It's true.

14
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,731
TALIESIN: It's called Malibu Sunset.

15
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:22,877
SAM: Yeah. Laura's dice budget would go way down.
Instead of throwing away 250 dice a week,

16
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:25,114
it would maybe be more like 240, 230.

17
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,382
LAURA: Oh God. Terrible.

18
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:29,221
SAM: I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving
his beard

19
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:33,749
and selling the beard shavings to those in need.

20
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,638
MATT: To be fair, it was worth it. Look at them on
my shelf.

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:43,465
SAM: I have just a few ideas for ways that you
guys could show your love for our sponsors.

22
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:47,462
Take them out for a candlelit dinner. I'm not
talking Bennigan's, I'm talking something

23
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:55,106
high-end. Shake Shack, Outback, maybe even P.F.
Chang's. How about sending some romantic texts to

24
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:59,810
spice things up? Keep it classy, like: Hey,
Critical Role Sponsor, I wish you could be with

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:07,188
me right now. Or, I had a dream last night,
and Critical Role Sponsor? You were in it.

26
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:13,010
And hey, compliments always help. Critical Role
Sponsor, do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,576
lost in your eyes. Or: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor,
of all the beautiful curves on your body,

28
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:25,296
I'm most in love with your smile. Or even:
Critical Role Sponsor, on a scale of one to ten,

29
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,332
you're a nine, and I'm the one you need.

30
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:31,035
MARISHA: Don't use that one, either, in real
life.

31
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,831
TALIESIN: That would work on me.

32
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,616
SAM: Or you could just go to their website and buy
their products.

33
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,383
(all cheer)

34
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,371
SAM: So, Tor Books, thanks so much.

35
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,820
MATT: Thank you, Tor Books, and thank you to all
those mentioned restaurants that will never be a

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,414
sponsor for us now, and it's probably for the
best.

37
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:47,883
TRAVIS: The Bennigan's and the Monte Cristo.

38
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,708
LAURA: Oh man, I hit up Bennigan's a lot.

39
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,516
MATT: I know, I was holding out for the P.F.
Chang's but, y'know. Thank you so much, Sam,

40
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,850
and thank you, Tor Books, for being our awesome
sponsor tonight. Make sure to check out A

41
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,913
Conjuring of Light, now available to you.
All right, next up, the new episode of GM Tips is

42
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:07,933
out. It came out today and this one is about
suggestions on homebrewing content for your

43
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:13,871
systems in game. I have, I think, three more
episodes that are going on in the coming weeks,

44
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,425
so look forward to those.

45
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:17,971
MARISHA: And then we hand it off to someone
awesome.

46
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:22,529
MATT: Exactly. We have a new person stepping in,
after those episodes, showing their own flavor to

47
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,465
the series. I'm excited about that.

48
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,968
MARISHA: Because you can only learn so much from
one teacher.

49
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:27,721
MATT: Exactly.

50
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,972
MARISHA: The best teachers will teach you that.

51
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:31,090
MATT: Yep.

52
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,722
TRAVIS: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only had
Master Splinter.

53
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,544
MARISHA: Shut. Up.

54
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:38,416
TRAVIS: Daniel-san only had Mr. Miyagi.

55
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,824
MARISHA: This is the real world, okay? This isn't
fantasy.

56
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,951
SAM: They were homeschooled, okay?

57
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,338
MATT: And how many times did they have to reboot
that to make it work?

58
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,746
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

59
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:51,015
MATT: Eventually ending with the Michael Bay
films. So check out that episode of GM Tips.

60
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:54,454
As a reminder to all you guys looking to
homebrew: It's hard.

61
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:56,926
It's time consuming. It's not for everybody.

62
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:58,307
LAURA: But it's so rewarding, Matthew.

63
00:03:58,307 --> 00:03:59,841
MATT: It can be rewarding.

64
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,809
LIAM: Could you do it different though?

65
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:06,208
MATT: Ugh. So check out the episode knowing that,

66
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,596
and we'll have next week's episode next
Wednesday.

67
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:14,073
TALIESIN: Your other friends tell me that they
miss you too. So yeah.

68
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:15,717
MARISHA: Mm-hm. That's true.

69
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:19,680
MATT: Yeah, I know. I'll see people again soon.
Also, I wanted to give a shout-out. We're in the

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,798
final 24-hour stretch for the Pillars of Eternity
II: Deadfire crowdsourced campaign. So if you

71
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:29,982
haven't yet, or you have interest in seeing the
sequel to that, go and check it out. They're doing

72
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:35,804
a final 24-hour stream over on Obsidian's stream
channel, of course after our episode tonight.

73
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:40,871
Go give them some love. And last, I have my list
here, I was just able to announce that I voice

74
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,808
Deadshot in the upcoming Justice 2.

75
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,512
(all cheer)

76
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,849
MATT: Coming out in mid-May.

77
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,731
LAURA: I play Supergirl!

78
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:57,306
MATT: Yeah! FantÃ¡stico! So look forward to that.
There may be some more surprises as the cast is

79
00:04:57,306 --> 00:05:01,711
announced progressively down the road. Super happy
to be a part of it.

80
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,115
LAURA: <i>Super</i> happy.

81
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,621
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (groan)

82
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,184
MATT: I need more alcohol.

83
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,814
(all laugh)

84
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,314
TRAVIS: Immediately.

85
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,874
MATT: Immediately. Taliesin, you wanted to mention
something about your new show?

86
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:16,605
TALIESIN: Yeah, we had the very first episode of
The Wednesday Club this week.

87
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:17,790
TRAVIS: Yeah!

88
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,160
TALIESIN: I have now had eight hours of sleep,
which is pretty magical.

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,688
MARISHA: It was so good.

90
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,845
TALIESIN: It was fun. And we're gonna be back this
week with our next episode. We're actually gonna

91
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:30,884
be talking about a lot of things, including
characters with mental health issues in comic

92
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:35,326
books, both superhero and otherwise. Including
Legion, from the X-Men, who has currently got a

93
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,172
show on FX which is magical.

94
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,364
TRAVIS: Yeah he does. It's really good.

95
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,503
MATT: It's really, really good. Holy shit.

96
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,075
TALIESIN: It's so good. So tune in, it's noon 'til
two on Wednesdays, on the twitch stream where you

97
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,793
probably are right now.

98
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:49,882
MATT: Noon 'til two Pacific.

99
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,679
TALIESIN: And I think we bumped it to Alpha,
but I don't remember, maybe not. And then it'll

100
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:56,486
be on the rebroadcast if you wanna see it,
but it's gonna be a lot of fun. Matt Key and Amy

101
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,280
Dallen will be there, it's gonna be great.

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,231
MATT: Cool. Thank you, Taliesin. If nobody else
has anything else to say...

103
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,032
TRAVIS: Cheese is for everybody. Not just me.

104
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:09,049
SAM: Did you just say Jesus for everybody?

105
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,031
TRAVIS: Cheese.

106
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:11,334
MARISHA: Cheez Its?

107
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,614
LIAM: Jesus for everybody.

108
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:16,084
MATT: Cheezits Christ for everybody.

109
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,314
TRAVIS: Cheez Its Crust.

110
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,780
(all laugh)

111
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,934
MATT: Without further ado, let's bring us into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

112
00:06:26,934 --> 00:07:56,393
(opening credits)

113
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:01,687
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So, picking up
where we last left off. Vox Machina, having

114
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:07,619
defeated the Chroma Conclave, and restoring order
and, for the time being, peace to the landscape of

115
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:14,570
Tal'Dorei, resurrected your friend, Scanlan
Shorthalt. However, he realised he needed some

116
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,656
time to himself, to both connect with his interest
in direction and life, and with his estranged

117
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:26,853
illegitimate daughter, Kaylie. Upon leaving,
the party proceeded to find their way to close

118
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:31,426
all the loose ends that they hadn't quite had time
to get to with the Conclave's assault. That

119
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:36,598
involved returning the ashes of Senokir's wife to
Vasselheim,

120
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:44,564
and then making your way to Ank'Harel to deliver
the hands of Ripley to the Scarbearers guild.

121
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:48,364
On your way there you encountered a new
adventurer, Taryon Darrington,

122
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,308
who was looking to
join an adventuring group for experience--

123
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,719
LIAM: He's my favorite.

124
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:56,985
MATT: Yes, he's the best. He paid his way into
your service and upon being returned to Whitestone

125
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:03,505
you gave him a hazing, which broke him enough to
be a little more honest with his reasoning for

126
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,162
going on this adventure.

127
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,611
LAURA: Let's not call it a hazing. It was an
audition.

128
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:10,544
MATT: It was an audition, it was a brutal
audition.

129
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:13,393
MARISHA: (singing) Don't call it a comeback!

130
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:19,632
MATT: There you go. In which, knowing more about
your new companion, you accepted him for the time

131
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:25,622
being, understanding the dangers that are involved
in following your path and he accepted. You made

132
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:33,974
your way to Emon, looking as a way to find passage
towards Vesrah, the home of the Water Ashari and

133
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:42,785
the hopeful completion of Keyleth's AraMente.
Upon finding and hiring a crew under the Captain

134
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:52,380
Adella, you made your way onto your new ship and
began to traverse westward onto the Ozmit Sea.

135
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,860
TRAVIS: Shit, we're on a boat. We're on a boat
motherfuckers!

136
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,044
MARISHA: (singing) Don't you ever forget!

137
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:01,187
(all laugh)

138
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,885
MATT: There is that.

139
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:07,617
LIAM: We are noble creatures.

140
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,015
MATT: So.

141
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:12,369
TRAVIS: (gasps) I hear the ocean.

142
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:13,868
SAM: That's someone snoring.

143
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:16,942
(all laugh)

144
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,924
TALIESIN: It's a rainstick.

145
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:29,007
MATT: So you guys have been at sea for a handful
of days. It's been relatively uneventful.

146
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:33,301
The boat slowly rocks, as the waters of the Ozmit
are much calmer by comparison to that of the

147
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:40,345
Lucidian Ocean. Making them a much more popular
trade route pass between the various continents on

148
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:47,749
this side of Exandria. Now the slow rocking of the
boat, across the somewhat choppy waters,

149
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:56,658
leads some of you into a relaxing lull over these
days. Others, into perpetual bouts of nausea.

150
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:59,807
But you notice that Captain Adella runs a
relatively tight ship. Her crew works like

151
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:04,921
clockwork, at her order, and the skies are
thankfully clear these first few days, and the

152
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:08,858
journey so far is mild. What would you guys like
to-- Is there anything you wish to accomplish as

153
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:14,302
you are travelling across the sea?

154
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:18,919
TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of sketching,
and working on something simple, that I might

155
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,153
even try and build while I'm here.

156
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:24,898
MARISHA: I'll catch up on some reading, I guess.
Some of my alchemy reading.

157
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:25,782
MATT: Okay.

158
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:26,984
TALIESIN: Stephen King novel.

159
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:29,417
MARISHA: From I've been doing, trying to make that
better.

160
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,665
MATT: Fair enough. Anyone else?

161
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:34,949
LIAM: I have been sort of shadowing Grog for a
couple of days,

162
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:37,990
'cause he doesn't have any gnomes 
to hang out with.

163
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,846
TRAVIS: Oh that's right. Oh, fuck, it's real when
you said it!

164
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:51,675
LIAM: I have been playing Boulder, Parchment,
Shears, and telling him stories.

165
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,390
TRAVIS: The non-violent kind.

166
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,166
LIAM: Yes, yes. Just hanging out, off and on.

167
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,028
MATT: Okay. Vex?

168
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:03,325
LAURA: I guess I've been trying to get to know
Tary a little bit better.

169
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,625
And also flying like
Vex-Kite behind the ship.

170
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,739
MATT: Okay. And Taryon?

171
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:20,349
SAM: Lots of push-ups, trying to beef up my pecs.
I also, at the start of every day, I'm going to

172
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:27,880
take two of those-- I have a bunch of silver coins
that I carry around with me, and I'm gonna cast a

173
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:32,066
couple of spells into them, just to have them at
the ready.

174
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:38,438
I cast Fly into one and Blur into the other.

175
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,766
MATT: Okay, good to know.

176
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,972
SAM: And then I would probably wander down to good
old Percy,

177
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,454
and just ask him if he needs help with
any tinkering.

178
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:52,157
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I wanna see what he has,
too.

179
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:55,193
Like, there's gonna be some trading.
I'll show stuff.

180
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,299
MATT: I'll show you mine, if you show me yours?

181
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,853
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

182
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:11,503
MATT: Perfect. So, as the two tinkering nerds
begin to reveal their secret inner interests, Vex,

183
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:19,800
you, about three days into this venture,
you catch what looks to be a dark spot right on

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:29,510
the horizon. Midday, maybe like two o'clock in the
afternoon, it's a warm sun, this far, as you start

185
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,685
moving westward and southward, you head closer to
what would be the equator of the planet.

186
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:40,341
It's getting warmer, and the sea spray is coming
up, the smell of seawater and brine occasionally

187
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:45,786
meets your nose, as the ship hits the various
waves as they come across, but you're still

188
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:49,464
keeping a keen eye out. And it's just endless sea
in all directions, you see no landmass, but you see

189
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:52,826
a little bit of something appearing at the
horizon.

190
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,607
LAURA: Like land, potentially?

191
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,474
MATT: It could very well be land.

192
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:03,969
LAURA: I guess I'll fly down and-- I'm gonna try
and stay off the deck as much as possible,

193
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,372
since it makes me so nauseous.

194
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:09,070
MATT: So you just glide around the--

195
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,086
LAURA: Yes.

196
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:12,382
TRAVIS: Your imaginary character is also
nauseous.

197
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,559
LAURA: Potentially, yes.

198
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,989
TRAVIS: That's a bummer.

199
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,557
LAURA: I know, right. Vex hasn't had a lot of
experience with ships, you know.

200
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,337
LIAM: Does your real self also get sea sick?

201
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,691
LAURA: I may have fed a couple sharks in my
lifetime.

202
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,656
TRAVIS: She painted the ocean. It was amazing.

203
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,578
MARISHA: Ooh.

204
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:32,128
LAURA: I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain
Adella.

205
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:37,017
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out, and as you move,
you catch a little more of the shape in the

206
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,810
distance. It looks a little small to be a
landmass.

207
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,990
If it is landmass, it's a very small
one.

208
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,670
LAURA: Oh.

209
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,073
MATT: But it's stationary.

210
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,025
LAURA: Oh, it could be another ship, possibly.

211
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:49,585
MATT: It could be a ship, it could be anything
that would be stationary. Literally, it's only

212
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:54,282
because of your keen vantage point, and your honed
eyesight, that you're able to even make that

213
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,611
slight, little bump in the horizon from here.

214
00:14:56,611 --> 00:15:03,715
LAURA: All right. Captain?

215
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:07,472
MATT: As you fly down, you see her, she's at the
front of the ship. She has her one hand currently

216
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:13,458
on the wheel, and she's looking out,
chatting to the side with one of her crewmates,

217
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:17,269
and turns around as you fly down next to her.
She's surprised at your immediate appearance and

218
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,475
she's like, "Oh, (gasps) sorry, I--"

219
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,389
LAURA: You'll get used to that someday.

220
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,792
MATT: One of these days, I'm sure.

221
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:23,720
LAURA: (laughs)

222
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,593
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

223
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:28,617
LAURA: I see something on the horizon; do you know
of any masses in the area?

224
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:33,573
Maybe a ship, or island, or--

225
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:38,092
MATT: "Take the helm." She hands off the wheel to
one of her compatriots,

226
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:41,309
and she rummages over in one
of the small chests to the side,

227
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:44,197
and pulls out a
large scroll and slams it onto a table she keeps

228
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:47,711
maybe ten feet off to the right of her. And she
goes through and pulls out a few

229
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,504
instruments. Marks the sun and takes a good five
minutes or so getting a really strong idea of where the

230
00:15:53,504 --> 00:16:00,264
positioning is. She looks down. "No, not much in
the way of landmasses out here, my dear."

231
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:02,805
LAURA: Do you have a telescope?

232
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:10,537
MATT: She goes and pulls out her particular eye
glass. It's small, but functional. Glances over,

233
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,066
and you look over in the direction and point it
out. There's nothing on the horizon.

234
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:17,880
LAURA: May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll
give it back.

235
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,837
MATT: There's a long pause--

236
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,848
LAURA: I've got nowhere to hide.

237
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,937
LIAM: Careful, butterfingers.

238
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,329
MATT: Passes it over.

239
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,372
LAURA: Up.

240
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:32,116
MATT: You take off, look up, extend it, keeping a
close view. Go ahead and make a perception check.

241
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,799
TRAVIS: First one of the day.

242
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,701
LAURA: (screams) First one, first one, first one.
Which of you?

243
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:36,973
TRAVIS: Set the tone. Roll like a champion.

244
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,496
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

245
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,812
LIAM: Natural one, the spyglass has fallen in the
ocean.

246
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,673
LAURA: Shut up, don't say it out loud!

247
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:43,743
TRAVIS: Why did you go with the weenie one?

248
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:46,867
LAURA: Shut up. 21?

249
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:50,950
MATT: 21? Okay. You take a moment and glance out
in the same direction you were,

250
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,046
and you scan past the horizon. Nothing.

251
00:16:54,046 --> 00:17:02,092
LAURA: Motherfuck. Well, I come back down.
It went under water, whatever it was. Does that

252
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:06,285
mean it was big enough to be some sort of sea
monster? Was it a sea monster?

253
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:10,223
MATT: "I sincerely hope not, for all of our sakes.
But, nevertheless, I'm gonna go ahead and have

254
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:14,590
"the men man our ballistas. Just to be safe."

255
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,499
LAURA: How quickly do those things move?

256
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:18,656
MATT: "What things?"

257
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:20,035
LAURA: Sea monsters.

258
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:21,514
MATT: "Depends on the sea monster."

259
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,968
LAURA: This one was very large.

260
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:32,136
MATT: "Hopefully slowly." And she shouts off,
"Full sail!" A bunch of the deckhands start

261
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,760
pulling the ropes down, letting the sail come to a
full-- flutter of wind itself isn't too terribly

262
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,275
strong, but it's enough to at least inflate the
sails even further,

263
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:43,049
and give a little more of a speedy direction.

264
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:48,181
LAURA: I wanna go back up and keep an eye,
with the spyglass, on any kind of movement,

265
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,179
that looks like it's coming towards us.

266
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,883
MATT: Okay, cool. Some of her men go over and
start loading the large ballistas to the back of

267
00:17:53,883 --> 00:18:00,772
the ship. Anybody else hanging out on the deck?

268
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:04,205
TRAVIS: Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading
for a new land.

269
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,326
LAURA: Oh wow.

270
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,455
TRAVIS: In New York you can-- No, sorry.

271
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:08,566
(all laugh)

272
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,258
TRAVIS: On the bow of the ship.

273
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,014
MATT: There you stand, at the bow of the ship.

274
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:18,864
You see at the very front there's the point,
the-- oh man.

275
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,023
TALIESIN: Are you really?

276
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,026
TRAVIS: What?

277
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:21,790
MARISHA: Are-- you're not...

278
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,867
TRAVIS: No, I'm just looking to see what I can
see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style.

279
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:28,605
MATT: There you go. As you glance out, with your
hand above on your brow, guarding the bright,

280
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:35,298
cloudless sunlight down upon you, it is just
endless ocean.

281
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:38,097
TRAVIS: Is there one of those amazing naked ladies
on the front of the ship?

282
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:41,102
Holding out the pole,
that comes out from the front?

283
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,709
MATT: Make a perception check.

284
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,652
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. Three.

285
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,421
(all laugh)

286
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,266
MATT: It's still hard to see from this vantage
point. You'll probably have to climb out there,

287
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,003
and climb down in front of the ship to see.

288
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,563
SAM: He's in the back of the ship.

289
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,675
(all laugh)

290
00:18:55,675 --> 00:19:00,304
TRAVIS: Do we mean to be going backwards?

291
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:09,708
MARISHA: I go up to the deckhands who are manning
the sails. Hi, heard it was full sail, full--

292
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,757
Do you need help with anything? To do-- you need--

293
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:15,832
LAURA: Wow.

294
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,531
MARISHA: I can make, like, wind.

295
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,879
TRAVIS: Oh, you can!

296
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:21,807
MARISHA: And we can maybe get there faster.

297
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,063
MATT: The gentleman who is there, currently
wrapping a rope around his forearm, as he's

298
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,814
pulling it down with his full weight, you can see
he's maybe in his late twenties, though still

299
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:33,652
going a little grey in the beard, for such a young
age, but his skin is weathered, he's kind of

300
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:37,846
missing a few teeth. He's got a large piece of--
like a bandana of cloth wrapped around the front

301
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:41,751
of his head, and just a leather tunic. He kind of
looks back to you.

302
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,688
"Um, I've got it, but thank you."

303
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:50,880
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 'Cause I can-- You're doing
great. Good work.

304
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,769
MATT: Right, okay.

305
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,593
TALIESIN: I'm gonna grab Bad News and run up to
the crow's nest and see if I can see anything.

306
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,622
MATT: Okay.

307
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:00,231
LIAM: Guess word has gotten around the ship then.

308
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,775
MATT: Yeah. Well, she did shout 'full sail,' 
I guess maybe you went up to see what was going

309
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:12,072
on. You get up to the crow's nest. Go ahead and
make a perception check.

310
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:21,321
TALIESIN: Make some room in here. What is my
perception? That's 20.

311
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:27,665
MATT: 20, okay. You get up there, lean out,
getting a view, you can see maybe 45 feet up,

312
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:33,572
Vex is also keeping her eye out via broom.
Taking her lead, and the direction she's facing,

313
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:36,481
you glance out in that direction, but it's just
open sea.

314
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:39,224
TALIESIN: I'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment,
for a little bit.

315
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:40,853
LIAM: Is Tary down below?

316
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:50,059
SAM: I was, but I came up too. Hi, hello, hi.
I have one of those little sticker things you put

317
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:52,666
on the back for motion sickness.

318
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,673
(all laugh)

319
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,529
SAM: One of these.

320
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:01,574
LAURA: One of those things you put on your wrist?
Yeah.

321
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,970
SAM: Hi, good day, good day, all.

322
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,124
TRAVIS: Bidet.

323
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:08,434
SAM: Good day, hi, hi. That's it.

324
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,321
(all laugh)

325
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:11,482
MATT: All right.

326
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:15,029
MARISHA: I shout out to Percy, what are you guys
looking for?

327
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,989
Everyone's so excited! This is so exciting.

328
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:20,023
TRAVIS: Why are you shouting? We have earrings.

329
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:25,290
MARISHA: I was-- because we're on the high seas,
and that's what sailors do.

330
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,509
TRAVIS: Is it?

331
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,341
MARISHA: Yeah! See, we're sailors, now!

332
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:29,891
TRAVIS: We're sailors now.

333
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,943
TALIESIN: She doesn't have to know what sailors
actually do.

334
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:35,865
MATT: The shiphand who's manning the sail who's a
foot from you right now just reaches up and covers

335
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:40,523
his ear and goes, "Uh. We don't really yell that
loud all the time

336
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:44,601
"into each other's ear, but thank you."

337
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:48,276
TRAVIS: Yo-ho-ho! And a... help.

338
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:51,403
MARISHA: Yeah.

339
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:56,565
TALIESIN: Keyleth, ask the captain if she wants to
have extra speed from your wind.

340
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,687
MARISHA: Captain.

341
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:00,186
TALIESIN: The captain, yes.

342
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:04,924
MARISHA: I was-- I'm not talking to you, anymore,
Percy. Captain.

343
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:11,215
MATT: As you approach from behind, she's currently
holding the wheel, and she doesn't even turn her

344
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,899
head to you, goes, "Yes?"

345
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:19,226
MARISHA: Would you like more speed behind those
sails?

346
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,707
MATT: "I mean, always, but--"

347
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:26,510
MARISHA: Okay! And then I go back and I start
doing Gusts into the sails.

348
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,736
MATT: Okay, Gust is a what-level spell?

349
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:34,110
MARISHA: Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a
level three Gust of Wind.

350
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,242
MATT: Gust would be like a (pfft). It's more of a
heavy fart.

351
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:41,277
MARISHA: Sorry, level two Gust of Wind.

352
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,834
LAURA: Basically you're blowing really hard.

353
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,213
MATT: A level three Gust of Wind, you said?

354
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:47,436
MARISHA: Level two, level two. Gust of Wind.

355
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,909
MATT: Concentration for up to a minute, so okay.

356
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:54,066
So as you focus-- actually, this is not a spell--

357
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,766
LAURA: We're gonna be so fast for a minute.

358
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:58,532
MATT: Second-level spell, and it cannot be done at
a higher level.

359
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:00,223
MARISHA: Okay.

360
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:03,893
MATT: However, it gives you a full minute of a
very focused gust of wind of, as it-- the sails

361
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:08,775
billow even further. You can see the ropes
tighten, the guy with the rope around his arm

362
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:15,013
goes, "Ow ow ow ow!" Has to unwind it real fast,
go in and ratchet it to the side. But the sails

363
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:20,474
pick up, and the ship itself picks up speed.
For the next minute you've got a nice burst or

364
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:24,572
so. You watch as the captain looks over the
shoulder to you and gives you a nod,

365
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:27,591
an approving nod, wordless, but--

366
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:32,609
MARISHA: Captain.

367
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:43,001
SAM: I turn to Doty, and I say, take this down.
With an efficiency and an effective leadership

368
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:49,079
role model for everyone, the redhead continues to
propel us forward, faster and faster, to

369
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:56,194
everyone's surprise and respect, including the
captain. As the salt licks my nose, and the sweet

370
00:23:56,194 --> 00:24:01,874
smell of adventure is in the air, I know that with
her on our side,

371
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:12,357
we will be strong and we will be
protected. End of chapter.

372
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:13,542
MATT: The tension on the ship--

373
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:17,477
MARISHA: Hey, look! I've got rubber booties!
(laughs)

374
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,787
SAM: You're amazing.

375
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:20,602
MARISHA: Aren't I cool, Tary?

376
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,238
SAM: Yes you are, ahoy!

377
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:23,182
MARISHA: Ahoy!

378
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:27,986
SAM: (hearty laugh) Delightful!

379
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:35,342
MATT: The tension on the ship slowly recedes over
the next hour as there is no sign of anything else.

380
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:36,393
LAURA: Nothing?

381
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,346
LIAM: Hey, man!

382
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:38,083
TRAVIS: What?

383
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,704
LIAM: You can't walk off in the middle of a game
of hide-and-seek again.

384
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,743
I've been in a barrel for an hour! 
I fell asleep in there!

385
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:48,385
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I get so distracted. Did
someone find you?

386
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:50,739
LIAM: No, I just woke up in a barrel, I don't even
know what time it is--

387
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,079
TRAVIS: Found you.

388
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,568
LIAM: TouchÃ©, Grog.

389
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:59,555
TRAVIS: Hey, do you want to help me? I think
there's one of those wooden naked ladies on the

390
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:01,675
front of the ship but I can't really see.

391
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:02,886
LIAM: Uh.

392
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:05,409
TRAVIS: Wanna reach a hand around and see if you
get a handful of wooden boob?

393
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,709
LIAM: Do you want me to do a reach-around,
is that what you're asking me to do?

394
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,469
TRAVIS: I might not ever ask you again, but right
now, yes.

395
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:15,517
LIAM: Okay, yeah, this is not like the wood
nymph-- Never mind.

396
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:17,038
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

397
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,879
LIAM: I go ahead and do a reach-around, I
suppose.

398
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:27,834
MATT: Okay. You shimmy out onto the front of the
ship. You do actually see just the cusp of what

399
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:35,783
looks like a pair of hands that are clasped,
carved into the top of where the wooden point at

400
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:38,546
the front of the ship is. So there is definitely a
figure there.

401
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:39,948
LIAM: Yeah, I'll hang down.

402
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:44,170
MATT: Okay. You hang down, and reach, as one
would.

403
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,686
(all laugh)

404
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,493
TALIESIN: This got weird quick.

405
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:50,149
MATT: As you kinda grasp over and hold and feel
around there--

406
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,964
LAURA: This is so ridiculous.

407
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:55,788
MATT: -- not finding much in the breasts,
but you find a bulge. It does indeed have a

408
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:58,369
figure at the front of the ship, this one is not
female.

409
00:25:58,369 --> 00:25:59,695
LIAM: Is it a wang?

410
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:00,557
MATT: Yeah.

411
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:01,357
LIAM: Nice.

412
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:03,112
MATT: I mean it's a bulge where one would be,
yeah.

413
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:03,894
LIAM: Okay.

414
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:04,915
MARISHA: This is an equal opportunity ship.

415
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:05,838
LAURA: That's right.

416
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,003
LIAM: Pat, pat, pat.

417
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,170
TRAVIS: What you got down there?

418
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,529
LIAM: Oh, she's a beaut, Grog, I wish you could
see her.

419
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:11,357
(all laugh)

420
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:13,683
TRAVIS: Really? Describe her to me in vivid
detail.

421
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:21,760
LIAM: Oh, uh. Athletic, hearty. You know,
curves in all the right places.

422
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,358
TRAVIS: I'm loving this.

423
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:25,340
LIAM: Yup, yup. Your type, I think.

424
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,900
TRAVIS: Man, battle scars?

425
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,995
LIAM: Uh.

426
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:34,388
TRAVIS: How many breasts? Please say three.

427
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:42,412
LIAM: It's one good, one good chest, here.
You know what, I will draw you a picture.

428
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:43,594
All right?

429
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:44,972
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's great!

430
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:47,723
LIAM: Okay. I'm gonna try to climb up without
falling into the drink, all right?

431
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:49,573
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that'd be good.

432
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,928
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check
real fast

433
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:53,823
TRAVIS: (giggles)

434
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:56,082
LIAM: Is this my character sheet?

435
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,840
(all laugh)

436
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,440
LIAM: That's a five.

437
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,074
MATT: That's a five? (laughs) You hear this brief
bit of tension (sound of exertion).

438
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:10,308
And then a (splash).

439
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:12,246
LAURA: (gasps)

440
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:26,532
TRAVIS: Vax? Vax? Yeah, okay, right, you fell off
the ship. Right? Vax? Um?!

441
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:31,307
(all laugh)

442
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,103
SAM: First player death.

443
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:38,148
TRAVIS: I think Vax may have fallen overboard.

444
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,597
MARISHA: Grog, what did you do?

445
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:45,521
TRAVIS: I know it could be a very elaborate joke,
but you know that sound when you deuce,

446
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:47,269
and it goes Â (ker-ploop)?

447
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,589
(all laugh)

448
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:50,234
TRAVIS: I just heard that and I think it was Vax.

449
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,434
MARISHA: Ugh.

450
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:52,984
LAURA: Can I look down in the water?

451
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:58,812
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, you look down, you don't see
anybody in the water, but a moment passes and you

452
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:05,223
glance over and there, up the side of the ship,
with two daggers, climbing, and soaking,

453
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:11,202
sopping wet with seawater, which has caused all
of the heavy, thick black fabric to just become an

454
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:17,049
additional 40 pounds on him, you watch Vax make
his way up to the top of the ship once more.

455
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,512
LIAM: This is the best this armor has smelled in
weeks!

456
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:21,585
(all laugh)

457
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:24,553
LIAM: Ugh. I love the ocean!

458
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,828
LAURA: I'm gonna land in the crow's nest with
Percy.

459
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:31,791
TRAVIS: That was amazing! You are so drenched
right now.

460
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,062
LIAM: I'm twice as heavy as normal.

461
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:37,327
TRAVIS: Man. Yeah, no seriously, she's that
stunning, huh, in the front?

462
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:37,997
LIAM: I start--

463
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:39,517
TRAVIS: I can't wait for the picture.

464
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,855
LIAM: Oh yeah, yes, big.

465
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:41,405
TRAVIS: Yeah.

466
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:42,187
LIAM: Big.

467
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,360
TRAVIS: Big booby.

468
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,218
(all laugh)

469
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:45,403
LIAM: That's you.

470
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,864
TRAVIS: Big booby.

471
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:52,378
MARISHA: I kinda do a quick, like, Druidcraft gust
and dry him off a little bit.

472
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:55,371
MATT: Okay. It's like holding a hairdryer to him,
just (loud whooshing).

473
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:56,301
(all laugh)

474
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,942
MATT: His lips are like (pbbbft) off to the side
briefly.

475
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,348
LIAM: I shake like a husky a little bit.

476
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:03,679
MATT: Exactly.

477
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,414
MATT: All right, you said you head to the crow's
nest with Percy?

478
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:06,067
LAURA: Yes.

479
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:07,119
TALIESIN: Yeah.

480
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,893
MATT: Okay. Anything in particular, just keeping
watch?

481
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,083
LAURA: Just keeping watch.

482
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,075
TALIESIN: Sitting and sketching.

483
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:11,897
LAURA: Yeah.

484
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,479
TALIESIN: Looking out every now and then.

485
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,756
LAURA: I don't feel as nauseous up here,
it's nice.

486
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,560
TALIESIN: Quite nice.

487
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:25,177
MATT: All right. About two hours later, I'll have
you both roll perception checks, if you could.

488
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:27,185
LIAM: This is the laziest day we've ever had.

489
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:28,273
LAURA: I know, it's nice.

490
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:29,019
MATT: Mm-hm.

491
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:29,815
TALIESIN: Wow, no.

492
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:31,136
MATT: Days at sea, it's nice.

493
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,027
SAM: Meanwhile, Whitestone burns.

494
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:33,734
(all laugh)

495
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:34,838
MATT: Shh.

496
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:35,803
TRAVIS: Getting flashes.

497
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:36,448
LAURA and MARISHA: No!

498
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:38,669
TALIESIN: To be fair, I'm not really looking very
much.

499
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:39,453
MATT: Fair enough.

500
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,147
TALIESIN: 11.

501
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:41,391
MATT: Okay. 11. Yeah, you're distracted.

502
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:42,200
TRAVIS: Oh, jeez.

503
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,967
TALIESIN: I'm distracted.

504
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:43,637
MATT: With your companion.

505
00:29:43,637 --> 00:29:44,712
LAURA: 18.

506
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:45,467
MATT: 18. Okay.

507
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,429
TALIESIN: You're less distracted.

508
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:47,627
LAURA: Uh, pretty distracted for Vex.

509
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:49,677
TRAVIS: Is it clear skies or are we sailing
through fog?

510
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,231
MATT: Uh, no, it is clear skies.

511
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:54,298
TRAVIS: Right, so we could just look up,
and see horror.

512
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:55,205
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

513
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,270
TRAVIS: What?

514
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,929
LAURA: We're not having sex, we're just talking.

515
00:29:58,929 --> 00:29:59,882
TRAVIS: Oh!

516
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:03,042
TALIESIN: Just having a chill. It's just to chill
up there. It's nice.

517
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:03,754
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

518
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:05,014
LIAM: Just like a prom make-out, that's all.

519
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:06,339
LAURA: No! Just chatting.

520
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,119
TALIESIN: You're just sitting and drawing in a
basket!

521
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,075
LAURA: Yeah.

522
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,378
TRAVIS: In a crow's nest? Like a big laundry
basket? It's just like--

523
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:12,511
TALIESIN: Yes, it's basically a hamper.

524
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,166
LAURA: Yeah.

525
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:13,972
TRAVIS Oh, okay.

526
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,113
LIAM: It's the most privacy you've had--

527
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,253
SAM: Any hand action going on?

528
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,321
TALIESIN: Oh my God!

529
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,289
MATT: (laughs) Jesus Christ!

530
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:22,615
LAURA: No hand action, no hand action.

531
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:23,828
TALIESIN: That got dark.

532
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:32,376
MATT: Anyway, you guys, due to distraction,
catch it about the same time the rest of the

533
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:37,674
party does. As you look ahead and notice that
there is a fog bank forming maybe

534
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:39,798
a few hundred feet ahead of the ship.

535
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,733
TRAVIS: Called it.

536
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,393
LAURA: Oh, shit.

537
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,067
MARISHA: Who sees it?

538
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,661
MATT: Well, everybody does now.

539
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:53,023
MARISHA: Oh, everybody does now. Can I do a nature
check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog?

540
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:55,814
MATT: Go for it.

541
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:59,546
MARISHA: That's not great. 14.

542
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:04,818
MATT: 14. It doesn't take much for you to realize
that this fog is pretty localized. It's not an

543
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:09,698
entire bank that covers the entirety of the ocean
in actuance. You kind of travel from one side of

544
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,267
the boat to the other to get the scope of it.
It's pretty narrow

545
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:14,605
and pretty focused in its direction.

546
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:18,214
MARISHA: Does this look like something that I
would have?

547
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:22,539
Like, is this another druid doing a
fog cloud spell?

548
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:27,914
MATT: You recognize this to be of similar size
although magnified.

549
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,284
MARISHA: Bigger than us?

550
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:30,425
MATT: A little--

551
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:32,229
MARISHA: Than my spell. Bigger than my spell?

552
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:35,318
MATT: Bigger than the usual spell that you are
used to casting but it does appear localized

553
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:40,768
enough to be of a similar-type spell or effect.

554
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:41,900
TRAVIS: Hey, Keyleth?

555
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,619
MARISHA: Yeah.

556
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:50,457
TRAVIS: Quick question. Is there a d-- decor-- uh,
like a proper way to announce ourselves?

557
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:51,325
SAM: Protocol.

558
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:55,845
TRAVIS: Thank you.

559
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:56,859
MARISHA: Well, I--

560
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:00,398
MATT: The ship suddenly lists a bit as you watch
as Adella is now turning the wheel and turning the

561
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,291
ship to try and veer around the fog bank that
suddenly has appeared, and she's shouting off to

562
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,800
some of her crew. They're starting to man the
ballista at the back of the ship once more--

563
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,006
LAURA: Is this normal? Is this a sea monster?

564
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:13,955
MATT: "Um. It's fog!"

565
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,365
TRAVIS: (laughs)

566
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:19,071
MATT: "I have not yet encountered a monster that
creates fog!

567
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,682
"But I'd rather not be caught off guard."

568
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:24,479
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, this--

569
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,276
SAM: I can communicate with semaphore if that's
something you'd like me to do?

570
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:29,065
TRAVIS: What's semaphore?

571
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:33,635
SAM: It's communication with flags. It's a
primitive communication technique that I learned

572
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:37,359
in many of my studies, boat-to-boat it's really
helpful.

573
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,390
I pull out a couple of pieces of fabric
and start gesturing--

574
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,913
TRAVIS: Holy shit. You're that guy.

575
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,636
(all laugh)

576
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:48,173
TRAVIS: Where is the other boat?

577
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:52,607
SAM: Well, you just said to announce ourselves,
I could announce. Vox--

578
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:54,338
LAURA: I wonder if they can see through the fog?

579
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:55,281
SAM: -- Ma--

580
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,444
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should have him do that.
You should go to the front of the ship--

581
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:58,347
SAM: -- chi--

582
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:00,533
TRAVIS: -- and just make sure they know we're
coming.

583
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:01,547
MARISHA: Can you do any flourishes?

584
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,509
SAM: -- na.

585
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,816
MARISHA: Can you do any like tosses? Like color
guard?

586
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,657
SAM: Oh, no, no.

587
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:07,050
MARISHA: Oh, damn. All right.

588
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,378
SAM: That would be really cool, though.

589
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:16,192
MARISHA: Sorry, Captain? How close are we to our
destination? This could be Vesrah.

590
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,841
MATT: "From the recent calculations I made on our
map, we're at least a day and a half out."

591
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:25,128
MARISHA: Really? Does this look to be
island-sized?

592
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:29,482
MATT: She's glancing over the front and-- you
guys, by the way, are up there in the crow's nest

593
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:33,879
and one of the ship hands is now climbing up the
rope net to get to the top as part of his job--

594
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,298
LAURA: It's a little crowded up here, but--

595
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:37,113
MATT: -- he gets up there and goes, "Um."

596
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:39,513
LAURA: I hop on the broom and get out of it so he
has more room.

597
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:42,851
TALIESIN: I'm used to this enough, I know how to
make room from last time I was on a boat.

598
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:47,104
MATT: He hops in and pulls out his spy glass and
begins looking out. Shouts down to the captain.

599
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:51,121
"Captain! It's moving!"

600
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:52,295
LAURA: It's moving!

601
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,358
TALIESIN: It's moving?

602
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:56,563
MATT: And you watch as she shifts-- the ship
begins to turn wide to move around and the fog

603
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:59,469
shifts to meet the direction of the ship.

604
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:00,562
LAURA: Oh, shit.

605
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:01,468
TRAVIS: Smart fog.

606
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:02,615
LAURA: I just pull out an arrow and get ready.

607
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:03,870
MARISHA: So it's coming towards us?

608
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,313
MATT: Mm-hm, or the ship is going towards it.

609
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,157
LAURA: I'm going to tie off a rope to the broom.

610
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:12,183
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.

611
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:16,737
MATT: All right. She continues to try and move
around, and the fog cloud shifts around,

612
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:22,206
shakes her head and you hear as Adella shouts
out, "All right, looks like we're going in.

613
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:29,894
"Be at the ready!" And eventually the fog bank
hits the front of the ship, and within moments

614
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:32,572
your visibility is cut to nothing.

615
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,576
TRAVIS: What?

616
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:36,846
MATT: You can see no more than maybe a few feet
past the edge of the boat, and for those at the

617
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,884
back of the ship, the front of the ship is
obscured. Those at the front of the ship,

618
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:41,583
the back of the ship is obscured. It is a very,
very thick fog

619
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,196
that has completely immersed the outside of 
the ship.

620
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:46,083
TRAVIS: Vax, don't try anything.

621
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,853
TALIESIN: Everybody keep checking in.

622
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:53,711
SAM: I will flip a coin to Jumbo over there and
tell him, listen,

623
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:57,086
if things get hairy you might
want to use this.

624
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:58,219
TRAVIS: Use what? I can't see you.

625
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,377
SAM: Oh, God! Shit!

626
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,028
(all laugh)

627
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:08,189
MARISHA: I do another Gust of Wind and clear the
ship deck and clear the path ahead of us.

628
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:15,897
MATT: Okay. They clear out, and slowly the fog
begins to choke back inwards. Slowly, it does help

629
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:20,501
temporarily, but as the ship moves forward
basically you move past the area that you've

630
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:23,818
cleared out a little bit, and the rest of the fog
tends to envelop it.

631
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:29,483
MARISHA: I'm going to see if I can see what this
is from underneath the water. I'll be back.

632
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:34,521
And I swan-dive off of the edge and into the
water.

633
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:37,250
LAURA: Did you say it over the earring?

634
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,071
MARISHA: Yeah, bye. I'll be back. Bye!

635
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,539
I'm going to do Alter Self to give myself
little gills

636
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:48,420
and little fin hands and go with the ship.

637
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,759
SAM: As I see her do this, I am going to alter
myself to have the same.

638
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:56,915
MARISHA: Oh! What's up, Tary?

639
00:35:56,915 --> 00:36:00,442
SAM: I pick up the coin and hand it to Grog and
say, this will make you fly.

640
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:02,716
And I'll dive over the edge as well.

641
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:08,369
MATT: Okay, Tary gives a graceful, if a little
clunkier, dive.

642
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,461
In full armor, which makes it hard to swim.

643
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,208
SAM: Oh, shit.

644
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,923
(all laugh)

645
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:17,656
MATT: But you can breathe underwater. It's medium
armor, it's not too crazy, you're fine. But you

646
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:22,649
with a much heavier splash. You look behind you,
and see Taryon has met you in the water with the

647
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:27,208
gills also kind of extending out of the sides of
his neck.

648
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,209
I would like both of you to make perception
checks.

649
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,482
(all laugh)

650
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,639
MATT: Make perception checks, please.

651
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,277
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

652
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,581
SAM: 16.

653
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:40,398
MARISHA: It was cocked. It was right on a 20,
which sucks.

654
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,333
That's all right, perception check, 24.

655
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:48,461
MATT: 24. Okay, as you guys hit the water and go
underneath for a second, you can see amongst the

656
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,993
water, which is relatively still out here,
and there's still the fog above,

657
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:54,948
you see a slight displacement in the water.

658
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:58,167
SAM: Oh, there's something in the water, a boat.

659
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:01,543
MATT: Keyleth, you look over and you can see the
displacement. There is nothing dark, but it's

660
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:04,450
almost like something is pushing down into the
water,

661
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,675
or like there is a concave portion of the water.

662
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:12,410
MARISHA: But nothing under the surface? Nothing
breaking the surface tension of the water?

663
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,930
MATT: It is breaking the surface tension,
like it's in-- as you glance over you can see

664
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:23,057
there's what appears to be an unnatural break in
the waves like a path.

665
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:24,176
LAURA: Like it's invisible?

666
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,989
MATT: It's like another ship or something of that
size is currently keeping in time with the

667
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:32,402
Drensala Vis.

668
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,631
TALIESIN: Oh.

669
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,549
MARISHA: It looks smooth. It looks man-made?

670
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:38,640
MATT: Well, you don't see what's there. All you
see is the break in the water.

671
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,011
MARISHA: It's invisible. Okay, I come up out of
the water and I

672
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,642
use my earring to communicate that
to everyone else.

673
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:48,457
MATT: Okay.

674
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:50,638
TRAVIS: Do you still have your fucking gills on?

675
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:51,781
MARISHA: It's, you know--

676
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:55,776
I don't know, do I?

677
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:57,447
LAURA: Does that mean you choke?

678
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,381
TRAVIS: Yeah are you like--

679
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:00,580
MARISHA: Can I communicate?

680
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,803
SAM: She has gills but she keeps her mouth and
stuff right?

681
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:06,289
MARISHA: I can still talk.

682
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:11,522
MATT: You can still speak, I'd say, once you break
the surface of the water.

683
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,148
MARISHA: Yeah I come out of the water and
communicate it.

684
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:14,898
MATT: Okay.

685
00:38:14,898 --> 00:38:16,958
TALIESIN: You sound like Kim Carnes. Everybody,
this is great.

686
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,768
(all laugh)

687
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:20,819
MARISHA: A little bit like Linda Blair.

688
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:23,916
MATT: All right, you guys hear Keyleth begin to
inform you as you hear off to the left side of the

689
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:32,025
ship two localized sounds-- it sounds like wood
slamming into wood or some sort of a heavy impact,

690
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:41,718
two in rapid succession. And you watch as from
out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged

691
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:49,804
and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks
slam into the ship with chains behind them that

692
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:56,019
suddenly grow taut. The rest of the crew begins to
turn around and move their ballistas in the

693
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:59,957
direction of where the chains come from,
but you still see nothing there.

694
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:01,766
The fog is too thick.

695
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,189
LIAM: I'm going to hide.

696
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:04,892
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

697
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,543
TRAVIS: And we can see the hooks, right?

698
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:10,386
MATT: You can see the hooks, yes.

699
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:13,467
LAURA: Can we see the hooks from the crow's nest?

700
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:18,148
MATT: It's just out of view. You watch them pass
through, and you see them arc below you,

701
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,260
and then vanish into the fog. And you hear the
impact

702
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,135
and the ship kind of (impact noise) from the hit.

703
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:24,726
LAURA: I want to try and hover down so I can see a
little better.

704
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:26,173
TALIESIN: Are you with me?

705
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:26,916
LAURA: Yeah.

706
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:31,423
TALIESIN: I'm going to very quietly say that I'm
going to grab onto your broom and head towards

707
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:34,577
that end. I'm also going to activate the spider
climbing boots.

708
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:35,590
MATT: Okay.

709
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,979
TRAVIS: I would definitely like to go and see the
giant sea creature claw

710
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:40,946
that just grabbed onto the boat.

711
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:44,802
MATT: Okay, you rush up to the edge of this giant
claw that's hit it and you can see it's a thick--

712
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,866
like a dark iron pole maybe about that long--

713
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:48,827
TRAVIS: Oh!

714
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:53,177
MATT: -- it's about that big around and has a
large chain affixed to it that just progresses off

715
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:59,388
that side of the boat into the fog. It looks like
a series of giant hooks or curved spikes,

716
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:04,789
and it has jammed and dug itself and dragged and
caught on to the actual deck of the ship.

717
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:09,993
TRAVIS: Good news, not a sea monster. Bad news,
a big hook that leads to nowhere.

718
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:13,029
LAURA: Get it off the ship. Can you pull it off?

719
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:16,530
TRAVIS: Sure. So I'll try and lift the hook off
the ship.

720
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:22,909
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

721
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:24,051
TRAVIS: 15.

722
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:30,292
MATT: 15. You're lifting right now and it's not
shifting. Unfortunately, the weight of both the

723
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:34,706
ship moving forward, the tension on the chain and
the hook, and the hook being so heavily dug into

724
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:40,232
the deck, like versus that portion you're just not
getting enough of a lift. There's too much torsion

725
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,989
on the actual connection to the ship.

726
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:46,516
TRAVIS: You know what, I want to see where this
leads. I'm going to leave it here.

727
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:48,103
LIAM: Fuck you, physics.

728
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:51,992
MARISHA: I'm going to swim closer to where the
chains are coming from

729
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,999
and swim closer to the invisi-ship.

730
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,193
SAM: I join her.

731
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:57,011
MATT: Okay.

732
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:58,527
LAURA: Trinket's going to run up next to Grog.

733
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:00,802
MATT: Okay, so Trinket and Grog are now heading to
the left side of the ship--

734
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,161
TRAVIS: Hey, buddy.

735
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:06,517
MATT: --you guys are swimming in the water towards
that direction, and you watch as suddenly what was

736
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:12,978
once a slight displacement in the water becomes
visible. And you see before you a smaller,

737
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:19,732
more compact-looking ship, but it has a series of
iron plates all across it in various places.

738
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,984
It's armored from all directions, haphazardly.

739
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:26,665
Not a beautiful construction per se, but made for
function.

740
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:29,108
MARISHA: I'm going to come up-- oh, go ahead.

741
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:33,136
MATT: You look up, and from what you can see on
the edge of the ship, and you can see what appear

742
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:38,012
to be two small gray crystals that are giving a
faint glow, and it looks like they are actually

743
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:42,750
creating and emanating this fog that is
surrounding the space.

744
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,736
TRAVIS: Awesome.

745
00:41:43,736 --> 00:41:44,751
TALIESIN: Fog machine.

746
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:51,893
MARISHA: I'm going to come up and, in the path as
the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie

747
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:56,916
Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire
the ship?

748
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,866
MATT: Okay, well, you can only Faerie Fire
creatures in a small area, a ship--

749
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:01,484
MARISHA: It's not going to do it.

750
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:03,135
MATT: --probably shouldn't be Faerie Fire.

751
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:11,021
MARISHA: Okay, then I'm going to see if I can--
can I try and grab onto the side of the ship?

752
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:15,002
MATT: With just your fingers? It's pretty-- I
mean-- okay, you know what, I will say because of

753
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:17,540
the iron plating there is a little bit of a grip.

754
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,750
MARISHA: The seams?

755
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,538
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

756
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,738
TRAVIS: With your webbed fingers.

757
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:23,003
SAM: Can I join her on this?

758
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:24,459
MATT: Mm-hm. You can, indeed.

759
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:28,881
MARISHA: Natural one.

760
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:33,610
MATT: You reach up and grab, and about three nails
snap,

761
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,225
and you lose your grip, falling back into the
water.

762
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:37,516
LAURA: Oh, shit.

763
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,040
TALIESIN: Oh, ow.

764
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,925
LAURA: That's just mean.

765
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,552
MARISHA: That shit hurts.

766
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,485
SAM: Athletics?

767
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:43,070
MATT: Yes.

768
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,951
SAM: Ten.

769
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:49,783
MATT: You barely hold on. You don't climb,
but you hold on and watch as Keyleth just--

770
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,481
SAM: Oh! I'm alone.

771
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:56,035
(all laugh)

772
00:42:56,035 --> 00:43:01,110
SAM: Do I see her in the water?

773
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,298
MATT: You see her splash and disappear under the
water below.

774
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:05,639
The fog is starting to close around the area.

775
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,996
SAM: Shit. She can swim; she'll be okay.
She's so strong and powerful.

776
00:43:08,996 --> 00:43:10,998
MARISHA: Do I see Tary?

777
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:14,814
MATT: You just went under the water. You come back
up and you watch Tary vanish as you're now being

778
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:17,326
left behind. The ships are traveling faster.

779
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,664
LAURA: Keyleth, can you do anything about this
fog?

780
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:30,932
MARISHA: Yes! Once I track down the ship.
I kind of swim up and I say, Tary can you catch--

781
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:40,418
this might be bad. Do I see any type of-- what are
they called? Cleats. The ship cleats. Do I see

782
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:43,482
anything like ship cleats? Right?

783
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:45,456
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's right, it's the little
prongs.

784
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,569
MARISHA: Like the little things, the prongs.
Do I see anything like that? I want to try and do

785
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:54,241
a-- like a grasp-- like Thorn Whip myself to the
ship.

786
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:59,901
MATT: You see one, it's a little ways up from
where the ship is actually hitting the water.

787
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:03,928
You would have to probably swim close enough to
get there. I'm going to say, make an athletics

788
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:08,799
check to see how quickly you can try and swim
against the ocean just for this brief moment.

789
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:11,168
You're going to have to roll pretty high.

790
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:13,671
MARISHA: Well, that's not great. Just straight
athletics?

791
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:14,996
MATT: Yeah.

792
00:44:14,996 --> 00:44:17,046
MARISHA: Athletics is pretty good! 15!

793
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:18,156
MATT: 15?

794
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,118
MARISHA: Yeah!

795
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:23,016
MATT: I'll say you don't fall too far behind the
ship, it's still going faster than you and the

796
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:29,422
water is kind of up and down. Using your Alter
Self gills, you can dive below the surface to try

797
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:34,386
and avoid the choppiness of the ocean, and you
come back up.

798
00:44:34,386 --> 00:44:37,927
What's the range on your Thorn Whip?

799
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:39,084
MARISHA: 30-foot range.

800
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:42,381
MATT: 30-foot range, and it pulls whatever is
there ten feet towards you. We can say it'll pull

801
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:47,520
you ten feet towards it. So it gives you a slight
arc, but not enough to actually reach the ship,

802
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,829
you can just cruise past the grasping range of
Taryon. So, Taryon, as you're there on the side

803
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:59,242
and you glance over and you watch as Keyleth
suddenly produces a large thorny whip, a druidic

804
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:02,592
vine that wraps around the small cleat on the side
of the ship.

805
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:03,578
SAM: Oh, shit.

806
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:05,230
MATT: And you watch as she arcs out of the fog
towards you,

807
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,952
reaching her hand out in your direction.

808
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:07,638
SAM: I will--

809
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,320
MARISHA: Tary!

810
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,953
SAM: Yes!

811
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:09,769
MARISHA: Tary!

812
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:10,851
SAM: Yes, grab my hero's hand.

813
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:13,436
(all laugh)

814
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:14,701
MATT: Okay. You grab her hand--

815
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:19,736
MARISHA: Tary! I want to apologize right now.
Because in this moment,

816
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:22,488
I am a damsel and I am in distress!

817
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:23,636
(all laugh)

818
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:26,362
MARISHA: So cross it off, bitch. Come on!

819
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:27,460
MATT: Make a strength check.

820
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,102
SAM: Okay. Okay.

821
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,713
TALIESIN: Oh, please. Oh, please.

822
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:32,663
SAM: Wait, strength?

823
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,491
MATT: Yes, just a strength modifier bonus.

824
00:45:34,491 --> 00:45:36,589
SAM: I'm feeling lucky! Yeah.

825
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:40,370
(all laugh)

826
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,075
SAM: 19.

827
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:42,166
LIAM: Hey!

828
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:45,636
MATT: Okay. All right. You grab her, and you-- it
pulls you from two points, but you had managed to

829
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:49,485
keep your hold and grasp Keyleth, now dangling
from your arm.

830
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:56,685
SAM: I did a lot of pushups today! Ow, ow, ow,
ow.

831
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,005
MATT: It is. You're very sore--

832
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,802
(all laugh)

833
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:01,647
MATT: You are very sore, but you manage to get her
right up to the edge of the ship, and she manages

834
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:05,446
to get a grip onto the edge.

835
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,550
SAM: I. Was amazing.

836
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,462
(all laugh)

837
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:12,234
MARISHA: You were.

838
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:15,426
Today, in this moment, for this 30
seconds of time--

839
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,322
SAM:Â Augh!

840
00:46:17,322 --> 00:46:19,745
(all laugh)

841
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:21,380
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be in the middle of this for
months.

842
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,409
MARISHA: --you were a hero.

843
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:27,310
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be right in the middle of
this. For months. Okay.

844
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,755
SAM: We'll omit that part.

845
00:46:28,755 --> 00:46:31,745
(all laugh)

846
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,791
TALIESIN: Did it leave a little stain?

847
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,499
SAM: It's in my nose.

848
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:39,533
MARISHA: Thanks. Okay.

849
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:42,760
MATT: You look up at this point and you can just
barely see the chain, and you watch as a couple

850
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,669
shapes, just barely visible through the fog,
are now

851
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:50,187
leaping across the chain towards your ship. So--

852
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:55,088
MARISHA: I give a heads up. Heads up, heads up,
people. Incoming forces, coming your way!

853
00:46:55,088 --> 00:46:59,127
MATT: You guys in the ship, you glance over where
the chains are currently pulling taut. You watch

854
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:05,121
as a series of humanoid figures wearing dark,
dark green and black leathers, their faces

855
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:07,945
partially obscured, rush onto the ship,
weapons drawn.

856
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:14,540
I'm gonna ask everyone to roll initiative.

857
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,849
MARISHA: Fuck. I hope these aren't my--

858
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:17,334
TRAVIS: Right. You ran into our ship!

859
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,115
MARISHA: --these aren't, like, my people,
right? I haven't found out who they are.

860
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:20,296
LAURA: I know! What if they are?

861
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,099
TRAVIS: We gonna kill 'em.

862
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:22,173
MARISHA: No!

863
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:27,682
TALIESIN: Whoa! I don't feel good about that.

864
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:28,804
LAURA: Look at that!

865
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,866
MARISHA: Yay, it's a boat!

866
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:30,816
TRAVIS: Boats!

867
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:31,698
SAM: There's a boat!

868
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:37,290
Oh, wow, the top-down view looks so
three-dimensional right now.

869
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:38,634
LAURA: Yeah, really, it does.

870
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:39,886
SAM: It's really cool.

871
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:41,294
LAURA: This is insane! This looks so 3D!

872
00:47:41,294 --> 00:47:42,188
TRAVIS: Well done, man!

873
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:43,443
SAM: 1980s graphics!

874
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,943
MATT: I can't take full credit for these.
These were already premade

875
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:46,083
TRAVIS: Aw.

876
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,652
TALIESIN: This is like the finest arcade that I've
ever been by.

877
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:48,877
LAURA: This is so cool.

878
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:49,650
TRAVIS: Which one's us?

879
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,742
MATT: All right. There's the two of them in the
ocean currently off to the side.

880
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:54,351
TRAVIS: You dingalings.

881
00:47:54,351 --> 00:48:10,877
LAURA: They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness
gracious.

882
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:13,565
This is so cool. What is this? What is that?

883
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:19,656
MATT: All right, so. Up in the crow's nest,
we have Percy, one of the other shipmates,

884
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:26,976
kinda up there. We have, down here at the wheel,
the captain.

885
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,488
These two, wielding two different ballistas.

886
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:31,309
TRAVIS: At the bow of the ship, heading for --

887
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,409
LAURA: -- a new land!

888
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:38,546
MATT: We have Doty, just hanging off to the side,
watching and trying to take record of whatever's

889
00:48:38,546 --> 00:48:41,028
happening at the moment. Grog, where are you?

890
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:42,487
TRAVIS: Wherever that grappling hook was.

891
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,967
MATT: That would be right here.

892
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,470
SAM: (roars)

893
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,015
MATT: With Trinket right by your side.

894
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,005
TRAVIS: Welcoming committee.

895
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:49,743
LAURA: Yeah.

896
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:50,826
SAM: We're gonna eat it.

897
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:52,384
LAURA: Me and Percy had said we were sort of on
our way down.

898
00:48:52,384 --> 00:48:54,643
TALIESIN: Or actually, we had sort of headed
towards the other boat.

899
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:55,462
LAURA: Yeah.

900
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:57,088
MATT: Right, so you guys had made your way.
So, yeah. So--

901
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:59,380
TALIESIN: I was gonna ask you to drop me at the
other crow's nest on the other ship.

902
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,120
LAURA: Oh.

903
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,596
TRAVIS: You need more iron in my diet.

904
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:03,147
MARISHA: These are probably the Water Ashari,
aren't they?

905
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:04,565
MATT: So you guys are heading this way? Are you
taking him with you?

906
00:49:04,565 --> 00:49:05,440
TALIESIN: If you're down.

907
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,799
LAURA: Uh, I was going to. I wasn't going to go
all the way to the other boat, but I can.

908
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:09,088
If you want to go with us.

909
00:49:09,088 --> 00:49:10,204
TALIESIN: Oh, please!

910
00:49:10,204 --> 00:49:11,211
SAM: Toy boat, toy boat.

911
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:12,059
SAM, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Toy boat.

912
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:13,244
TALIESIN and LAURA: Toy boat.

913
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:14,320
SAM: Tor Books.

914
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,477
SAM and TALIESIN: Tor Books, Tor Books.

915
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:16,868
(all laugh)

916
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,695
TALIESIN: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.
It's actually kinda hard.

917
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:19,393
SAM: Yeah.

918
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:21,073
MATT: All right. Vax, where are you? Since you are
hiding.

919
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:23,088
LIAM: Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a
25--

920
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:23,805
MATT: Right.

921
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:26,005
LIAM: I didn't know what the boat looked like,
so if there's stuff in the bottom, I'd hide

922
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,747
there, but if they're gone, I could also have gone up
to the crow's nest. Whichever.

923
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:33,794
MATT: You could probably be hiding amongst one of
the low sails probably. So we'll say you're up in

924
00:49:33,794 --> 00:49:35,269
this sail.

925
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:36,089
LIAM: Okay.

926
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:41,786
MATT: In that vicinity. All righty. So. Bringing
us now to the initiative order.

927
00:49:41,786 --> 00:49:45,148
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

928
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,442
MATT: 25 to 20?

929
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,716
LIAM: Shit.

930
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:49,464
MATT: All righty.

931
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:50,270
LAURA: Oh, no.

932
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,670
SAM: Yikes.

933
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,084
LIAM: (knocks on table)

934
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:54,864
MATT: 20 to 15?

935
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:55,671
TALIESIN: 15.

936
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:56,450
LAURA: 18.

937
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,203
LIAM: 18.

938
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,041
MATT: All right.

939
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,026
LAURA: Eee.

940
00:49:59,026 --> 00:49:59,646
LIAM: Yeah.

941
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:00,370
MARISHA: Twins.

942
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,296
LIAM: Wapetopetok!

943
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:02,345
LAURA and LIAM: (explosion sounds)

944
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:03,114
TRAVIS: You both had 18?

945
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:03,911
LAURA: Yeah!

946
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:05,844
TRAVIS: Nice.

947
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:07,489
MATT: 15 to ten?

948
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:08,729
TRAVIS: 14.

949
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:14,276
MATT: Grog. All right.

950
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:17,197
MARISHA: Oh. 11. Sorry.

951
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:20,960
MATT: That's all right. Keyleth. And then?

952
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,399
SAM: Eight.

953
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:23,281
MATT: Tary.

954
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,845
LAURA: Hey, look, some things don't change.

955
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:27,020
(all laugh)

956
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,414
MATT: Nice!

957
00:50:29,414 --> 00:50:30,220
TALIESIN: Burn!

958
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,769
SAM: Stings.

959
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:39,857
MATT: All righty. So. You watch as these figures
just jump across from the chains that are lashed

960
00:50:39,857 --> 00:50:45,863
onto the boat, and as two of them make it across,
suddenly, up the side of the ship, you watch as

961
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:52,718
if a singular wave seems to (water rushing) and
splash onto the edge of the ship. However,

962
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:59,807
as the water crests and splashes into the ground,
it forms up into its own physical entity.

963
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,533
SAM: Ooh.

964
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:01,257
TRAVIS: What?

965
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:02,278
MARISHA: Oh shit. Water elementals.

966
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:04,865
MATT: You've seen this form once before,
that Keyleth has taken--

967
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:05,514
LAURA: (gasps)

968
00:51:05,514 --> 00:51:06,884
MATT: --this is a water elemental.

969
00:51:06,884 --> 00:51:08,409
LAURA: What if this is the Ashari?

970
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:13,120
MARISHA: It probably is. Just haven't figured that
out yet.

971
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,200
MATT: (laughs) Where did I last put it? All
righty, so. That being the case, I'm gonna go

972
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,706
ahead and pull these up there.

973
00:51:21,706 --> 00:51:24,109
LAURA: Did we say we did anything about the fog?
The fog is still there.

974
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:27,721
MATT: The fog is still in this vicinity right now.
So, you're under the effect of a Fog Cloud

975
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:40,543
spell... for the area. So, basically, the area
around is heavily obscured. So that will increase

976
00:51:40,543 --> 00:51:49,186
uh, AC to a number of individuals. Perfect.
All right, so. So first off, this elemental

977
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:54,355
rushes forward to Grog, splashes around in your
direction. Grog, it's gonna go ahead and take a

978
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:56,872
series of swings at you.

979
00:51:56,872 --> 00:52:02,899
TRAVIS: Sweet.

980
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:07,514
MATT: Yeah, it's gonna take two slam attacks.
That is a 23 to hit?

981
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:08,843
TRAVIS: Hits.

982
00:52:08,843 --> 00:52:10,600
MATT: And an 18 to hit.

983
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,652
TRAVIS: Hits also.

984
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:17,809
MATT: All righty. So you suffer 12 points of
bludgeoning damage.

985
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,534
That's full damage. You're not raging.

986
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:20,375
TRAVIS: Nope.

987
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:24,329
MATT: And that is 15. 15 points of bludgeoning
damage.

988
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,201
TRAVIS: Total? Or 12 and 15 both?

989
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:26,960
MATT: 12 and 15.

990
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,277
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

991
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:36,254
MATT: All right, that ends that guy's turn.
Next up is Vax and Vex.

992
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,862
LAURA: I was on my way over to the other--

993
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:40,632
TALIESIN: Drop off.

994
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:41,854
LAURA: -- towards the other ship.

995
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:42,598
TRAVIS: Bludgeoning.

996
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:43,660
TALIESIN: As long as you roll by, I'll just let
go.

997
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,457
LAURA: Okay.

998
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:45,281
TALIESIN: You can drop me off.

999
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:47,925
LAURA: Percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's
nest, so I'll fly over that direction.

1000
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:49,681
MATT: Okay.

1001
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:53,735
LAURA: Keeping an eye out for anything visible
that I can shoot at.

1002
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:57,271
TALIESIN: The minute I see a rope, I'll just let
go and drop. So she can just keep moving.

1003
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:58,852
MATT: Okay. So we'll say--

1004
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:03,101
LAURA: Flyby.

1005
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:06,440
MATT: As you guys make it onto the other side of
the ship--

1006
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,251
TALIESIN: You know, you could've spent your time
making

1007
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,268
two very complex Lego pirate ships. All week.

1008
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:11,973
MATT: You're right.

1009
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:12,705
TALIESIN: I'm just saying.

1010
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:14,066
MATT: But I don't have that time, unfortunately.

1011
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,063
(all laugh)

1012
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:17,619
MATT: Right, so you guys, right over to this ship
here?

1013
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:18,251
LAURA: Yeah.

1014
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:19,017
MATT: You drop him in the crow's nest.

1015
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:19,713
LAURA: Uh-huh.

1016
00:53:19,713 --> 00:53:21,456
MATT: All right. And you are currently on your
bow? Is that all you're gonna do?

1017
00:53:21,456 --> 00:53:24,825
LAURA: I'm on-- yeah, I'm on my broom. I'm just
riding my bow around.

1018
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:25,808
MATT: Fair enough.

1019
00:53:25,808 --> 00:53:31,610
LAURA: Can I drift down to where I can see
anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog?

1020
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,140
Can you do anything about the fog?

1021
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,235
MATT: On their ship?

1022
00:53:35,235 --> 00:53:36,282
LAURA: Yeah.

1023
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:44,744
MATT: Okay. So as you coast down a little lower,
I want you to make a perception check.

1024
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:46,281
LAURA: I like that one. 31.

1025
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:47,094
TRAVIS: Jesus.

1026
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:52,172
MATT: 31. You glance down, and as the fog parts,
you see on this ship, there are three other

1027
00:53:52,172 --> 00:53:57,809
similarly dressed, dark green and black leather
humanoids that are now beginning to rush over the

1028
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:04,214
chain, and standing back, on the back of the ship,
arms crossed, you see a large humanoid with

1029
00:54:04,214 --> 00:54:10,327
a fish-like head. It has no nose, a big
fish-like mouth, big bulbous throat, kind of a

1030
00:54:10,395 --> 00:54:16,975
greenish-blue skin color, very turquoise,
with big fin gills at the side and a large crest

1031
00:54:16,975 --> 00:54:22,038
that goes down the head. But it's wearing fine
billowing silks, and a large vest, and its lower

1032
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:29,144
torso, from this giant oversized kind of plump
belly, the lower torso is just this swirl of water

1033
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:33,547
that sits there, and it looks like it's currently
concentrating

1034
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:36,577
through the fog on the opposite side.

1035
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,562
LAURA: Oh, jebus.

1036
00:54:37,562 --> 00:54:39,160
MATT: It does not seem to notice you at the
moment.

1037
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,485
LAURA: Then, I'm gonna try to Bramble Shot that
motherfucker.

1038
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,213
MATT: It is right there.

1039
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:44,434
MARISHA: Well, that's pretty cool.

1040
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:46,301
LAURA: I'm gonna try to shoot a Bramble Shot at
him.

1041
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:48,154
MATT: Go for it.

1042
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:51,993
LAURA: Okay. 20?

1043
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:56,204
MATT: 20? Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1044
00:54:56,204 --> 00:55:04,036
LAURA: Yes. Okay. Oh, Hunter's Mark. Motherfuck!
That's okay, sneak attack.

1045
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:05,885
TRAVIS: It's all right, you've never played this
game before.

1046
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:11,659
LAURA: Why? I can't help it, I get so happy.
Okay.

1047
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,371
MATT: Let's see. Actually, roll again. Because in
the fog cloud

1048
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:18,675
you do have disadvantage on strikes.

1049
00:55:18,675 --> 00:55:20,288
TRAVIS: Oh, that's cruel, man.

1050
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:21,323
LAURA: That's cruel.

1051
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:23,459
TRAVIS: (laughs painfully) Don't do it.

1052
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:24,200
MATT: One?

1053
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,903
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1054
00:55:24,903 --> 00:55:26,730
MATT: Oh. That sucks.

1055
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,953
LAURA: That's okay. That's okay, I'm gonna try to
do another shot.

1056
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:31,237
And in that downtime, I'm gonna
fucking Hunter's Mark.

1057
00:55:31,237 --> 00:55:32,367
SAM: Yeah!

1058
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:35,088
MATT: There you go.

1059
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:37,000
SAM: Turn them lemons--

1060
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,376
TRAVIS: Into orange juice.

1061
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,476
(all laugh)

1062
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:45,309
MATT: So this entity is currently Hunter's Marked,
and you can

1063
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,062
take your second attack, if you like.

1064
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:50,237
LAURA: Okay. I can't do a Bramble Shot again
'cause that was wasted? Or does that mean-- Does a

1065
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:53,384
Bramble Shot only work if it connects?

1066
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:56,328
MATT: I'm gonna say for the purpose of this
Bramble Shot, 'cause it's only fair and it's a

1067
00:55:56,328 --> 00:56:00,815
powerful vestige, it only works if it connects.
That should change the wording on that.

1068
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,139
LAURA: Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try.

1069
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:07,593
MATT: Go for it.

1070
00:56:07,593 --> 00:56:09,229
LAURA: 19?

1071
00:56:09,229 --> 00:56:10,417
MATT: 19 does hit.

1072
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:24,169
LAURA: Yes! Okay. 15 plus four lightning damage.

1073
00:56:24,169 --> 00:56:25,891
MATT: Slick.

1074
00:56:25,891 --> 00:56:36,985
LAURA: Plus Sneak Attack. Woo, an 11 for the Sneak
Attack and Hunter's Mark. And then the DC of 17 or

1075
00:56:36,985 --> 00:56:39,003
be restrained. That's strength save.

1076
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:39,935
MATT: Gotcha.

1077
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:43,262
LAURA: And I'm gonna do the Bramble Shot damage
now.

1078
00:56:43,262 --> 00:56:45,448
MATT: That is a 13.

1079
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:47,225
LAURA: Hoo, yes! He's restrained.

1080
00:56:47,225 --> 00:56:50,060
MATT: Go for it, roll the damage. For Bramble
Shot.

1081
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:55,714
LAURA: Ooh. Is that a sev-- that's a one. 16.

1082
00:56:55,714 --> 00:57:04,250
MATT: 16. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and make a
concentration check on him. He succeeds.

1083
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:11,230
With a 26. All right, so, the first shot whips
past and just slams into the ship. You watch as

1084
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:16,522
this giant fish entity kinda glances off to the
side, looks down and starts looking up into the

1085
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:21,495
fog cloud, but you're right above it at this
point, or just off to the side, and you fire your

1086
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:27,847
second arrow, it turns just in time to see it hit
it in the shoulder, as it glances up, tries to

1087
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,007
snap it free. The wooden shaft of the arrow
suddenly sprouts all these vines and thorns that

1088
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:35,866
begin to wrap around it and it tears in its body,
and

1089
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,512
it's currently stuck in place. It cannot
move.

1090
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:44,284
LAURA: Awesome. And I say, Percy, spellcaster,
right below you. Fish guy.

1091
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:48,352
TALIESIN: (exhales) Got it.

1092
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:49,733
Not sure what to do.

1093
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,210
SAM: Noted.

1094
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,591
MATT: All right. So, ending that, we come to Vax's
turn.

1095
00:57:56,591 --> 00:58:01,334
LIAM: One of the assailants is directly across
from me, on the other side of our boat, right?

1096
00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:04,284
MATT: There is one crossing right now.

1097
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,017
LIAM: But there is one guy who made it onto the
boat?

1098
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:07,245
MATT: There's two of them who made onto the boat,
right there.

1099
00:58:07,245 --> 00:58:09,310
LIAM: Right there? I'm gonna attempt to
Assassinate that motherfucker.

1100
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,519
MATT: Okay.

1101
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:11,646
LAURA: Oh, god!

1102
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:15,052
MATT: So you're-- we'll say you're up over,
you kind of shimmy your way along the edge of the

1103
00:58:15,052 --> 00:58:18,190
sail, and you're looking right down below him.

1104
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:18,956
LIAM: Okay.

1105
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:19,999
MATT: This guy right there.

1106
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,220
LIAM: So, advantage on this.

1107
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,280
MATT: The guy closest to Grog, or the guy who's
alone right there?

1108
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,299
LIAM: The one that you are touching right now.

1109
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:26,271
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

1110
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:28,685
LIAM: Yeah. So that is a 32 to hit.

1111
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:30,806
MATT: That will hit.

1112
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:33,494
LIAM: So this is Assassinate, it's an auto-crit--

1113
00:58:33,494 --> 00:58:35,596
MATT: Did you roll at disadvantage because of the
fog cloud?

1114
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:39,822
LIAM: Well, no, but I'm at advantage because of
Assassinate, so the first roll was a 19.

1115
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:41,459
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine.

1116
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:44,554
LIAM: Which is still a 32. Here we go.

1117
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,256
LAURA: I get 2d6 now for Sneak Attack.

1118
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:49,101
MATT: You do. So roll another d6.

1119
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:49,925
LAURA: Another six!

1120
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:51,062
MATT: Nice!

1121
00:58:51,062 --> 00:58:55,519
TALIESIN: Hey, that die!

1122
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,614
MATT: That's 48 points of damage in one hit.

1123
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:02,432
LAURA: Bramble Shot, motherfucker!

1124
00:59:02,432 --> 00:59:10,306
LIAM: Doing my maths over here. 32, 36, 72.
That's 80 points of damage.

1125
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:11,838
MATT: 80 points of damage.

1126
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:14,756
TRAVIS: What the fuck? No wonder Tary almost
died.

1127
00:59:14,756 --> 00:59:17,332
LIAM: Is he still standing?

1128
00:59:17,332 --> 00:59:18,167
MATT: No.

1129
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,547
(all laugh)

1130
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:20,661
TRAVIS: Assassinate!

1131
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:26,329
MATT: Just leaps off the chain and pulls out what
looks like-- for this, it would be a dagger and a

1132
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:34,394
rapier. Glances around and goes lunging in for the
captain of the ship. Gets maybe two steps,

1133
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:40,140
before your blade sinks into the back of the
neck. And he just hits the side, and collapses,

1134
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:43,018
right at the edge of the ship right there. Done.

1135
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:47,468
LIAM: Okay, just for funsies I will throw my
second dagger at the one right in front of Trink.

1136
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:48,623
MATT: Okay.

1137
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:49,939
LIAM: So, that is not that good.

1138
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:50,473
LAURA: Ooh.

1139
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:51,806
LIAM: That's a 13.

1140
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:55,127
MATT: Okay, yeah. Even with disadvantage. Okay.
So this one you fire, and just disappears off to

1141
00:59:55,127 --> 00:59:59,097
the side of the ship, but returns to your belt.
Are you gonna stay where you are?

1142
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:04,577
LIAM: No, I'm gonna drop down.

1143
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:05,906
MATT: Okay.

1144
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:08,108
LIAM: And circle around Trinket's tush.

1145
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:09,283
MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check.

1146
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:10,359
LIAM: Sure.

1147
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:12,394
MATT: Just to land from the top there.

1148
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:13,315
LIAM: Yeah, 25.

1149
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:18,613
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. So you move around behind
Trinket. All righty. Â That ends your turn, Vax.

1150
01:00:18,613 --> 01:00:19,986
Percy, you're up.

1151
01:00:19,986 --> 01:00:22,765
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm gonna take a quick look around
to see if I can figure out what's causing this fog

1152
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:24,407
because it's annoying me.

1153
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:27,368
MATT: Perception check.

1154
01:00:27,368 --> 01:00:30,122
TALIESIN: That's a 19.

1155
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:36,516
MATT: Glancing about in the area, it's hard to
see, especially from this vantage point.

1156
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:40,487
The area is so heavily obscured with fog.
You do glance and see what looks to be a very,

1157
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:45,746
very faint general glow in a lower area towards
the edge of the ship.

1158
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,345
But that's all you can make out.

1159
01:00:47,345 --> 01:00:49,056
TALIESIN: Starboard? Port?

1160
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:51,666
MATT: It'd be on this side.

1161
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,081
TALIESIN: All right.

1162
01:00:53,081 --> 01:01:01,642
Somebody take a look at anything. There's a glow
coming from the starboard side of the enemy ship.

1163
01:01:01,642 --> 01:01:06,034
It's the one closest to our ship. We need to find
out what's causing this fog. In the meantime,

1164
01:01:06,034 --> 01:01:12,491
I'm gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the
ropes. Is that an enemy right there? That guy?

1165
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:13,525
MATT: You're up here.

1166
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:16,792
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. I'm asking if that's an
enemy on our ship, right there.

1167
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,663
MATT: This is an enemy right there.

1168
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:19,591
MARISHA: The water elemental.

1169
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:21,893
MATT: These are enemies. These are your guys,
the guys with the red cloaks; the red color

1170
01:01:21,893 --> 01:01:23,705
signifies your own crewmates.

1171
01:01:23,705 --> 01:01:25,975
TALIESIN: Okay, so we have two enemies that are
currently on their ship.

1172
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:28,242
MATT: Two enemies in their ship, one that's
currently crossing,

1173
01:01:28,242 --> 01:01:30,107
and one that is on the other side.

1174
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:35,009
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm gonna slowly start making my
way, just maybe a few feet down, and I'm going to

1175
01:01:35,009 --> 01:01:39,594
shoot those two people who are on the very edge.
Both of them in the back.

1176
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:40,990
SAM: There's no honor in that.

1177
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,343
TALIESIN: No. There is, on the other hand,
fine comedy about to happen.

1178
01:01:43,343 --> 01:01:49,165
SAM: True, true.

1179
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:54,801
TALIESIN: I'm gonna very, very carefully.
And I'm at disadvantage with this?

1180
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,368
MATT: Disadvantage with each strike, yes.

1181
01:01:56,368 --> 01:02:00,480
TALIESIN: Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna use
the pepperbox, the Animus,

1182
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,726
and I'm also going to burn a Grit for a push.

1183
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:06,538
MATT: For which one of these guys?

1184
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:07,806
TALIESIN: What about one on each?

1185
01:02:07,806 --> 01:02:08,814
MATT: One of these two?

1186
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:10,402
TALIESIN: Both of them. I'll start with the first
one, and work my way down.

1187
01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:11,529
MATT: Okay. First one there.

1188
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:14,809
TALIESIN: All right, so, let's see what happens.

1189
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:16,902
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies!

1190
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:19,240
TALIESIN: That will do. That's a 28?

1191
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,478
MATT: 28 will hit.

1192
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:26,271
TALIESIN: And that's-- I'm sorry, you know why I'm
a little confused,

1193
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:34,139
I just had to switch, again. That's, wow--

1194
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:35,199
MARISHA: That's good.

1195
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:37,961
TALIESIN: -- that's good. That's 17 points of
damage and five points of psychic damage.

1196
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:39,355
MATT: Nice!

1197
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,139
TALIESIN: And he goes ten feet away from me.

1198
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:43,989
TRAVIS: Ah.

1199
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:45,157
LAURA: Oh!

1200
01:02:45,157 --> 01:02:46,083
MARISHA: (yelps)

1201
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,376
TALIESIN: (laughs)

1202
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:49,230
MATT: As he's trying to step across the chain--

1203
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:49,994
LIAM: Wilhelm scream.

1204
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:50,852
MATT: (gunshot)

1205
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:51,852
MARISHA: (Wilhelm screams)

1206
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:55,968
MATT: He gets blasted. And (Wilhelm scream) just
plunges off the side of the chain, loses his footing,

1207
01:02:55,968 --> 01:03:00,585
tumbles over, and vanishes into the fog.
And you hear this splash, a moment later.

1208
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:06,076
TALIESIN: Next! I love boats.

1209
01:03:06,076 --> 01:03:08,169
MATT: So this guy? Disadvantage on this shot.

1210
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:14,093
TALIESIN: Yep. Here we go. That's, oh that's good,
29. I'm rolling really well.

1211
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:15,625
MATT: Yeah, that will hit.

1212
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,338
TALIESIN: Not as well as yesterday, but really
well.

1213
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:22,738
MARISHA: (singing) I got a nautical themed,
pashmina Afghan.

1214
01:03:22,738 --> 01:03:29,708
TALIESIN: And that's five, six: that's 11 points
of damage and five points of psychic damage,

1215
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,184
and a ten-foot push.

1216
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:38,066
MATT: All righty. Okay. He also (snapping sound)
falls off, grabs the chain, catches it with his

1217
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:40,736
finger, but because of the sea spray and the fog,
it's too slick and

1218
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:42,417
(slipping sound, Wilhelm scream) just falls.

1219
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:44,629
TALIESIN: I was just gonna say, he's happy to
grab, and I'll deal with that too.

1220
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:46,588
MATT: Yeah. But they both have fallen off the
ship.

1221
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:48,330
MARISHA: That's what she said? No.

1222
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,374
TALIESIN: I can make him drop things. I have that
power.

1223
01:03:50,374 --> 01:03:54,034
MARISHA: Oh. My god. Drop the chain they're
holding on to?

1224
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:56,701
TALIESIN: I've been wanting to watch somebody
holding on and make them drop it. I've been

1225
01:03:56,701 --> 01:04:00,667
wanting to do that for like, probably a year and a
half now.

1226
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:03,024
God, is there anybody fun on our side?

1227
01:04:03,024 --> 01:04:04,242
LAURA: The fish guy.

1228
01:04:04,242 --> 01:04:05,680
TALIESIN: You've got him grappled.

1229
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,673
MATT: You've one guy walking across, right now,
on the chain, and the guy below you who is grappled,

1230
01:04:10,673 --> 01:04:13,003
and the water elemental that's also attacking
you.

1231
01:04:13,003 --> 01:04:15,403
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't you get advantage on grappled
guy?

1232
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:17,249
TALIESIN: Technically I would. That would cancel
out, wouldn't it?

1233
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:20,737
MATT: He is restrained, which means attacks on him
are with advantage, so it would cancel it out.

1234
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:25,399
TALIESIN: It would cancel it out automatically.
Oh. In that case, I'm gonna take a shot on him.

1235
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:28,803
LAURA: And it'll probably get a chance to be
unrestrained as soon as it's his turn.

1236
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:32,883
TALIESIN: Okay, good point. So, I'm gonna take a
Sharpshooter shot.

1237
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:37,687
I'm also going to-- is he holding anything?

1238
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:39,262
MATT: Not that you can see.

1239
01:04:39,262 --> 01:04:47,435
TALIESIN: That's good. And he's a magic? Yeah,
that will do. I'll just take a good old-fashioned

1240
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:57,876
Sharpshooter shot. So that's-- that's not as good.
That's 18 to hit?

1241
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:01,408
MATT: 18 to hit? Just barely hits.

1242
01:05:01,408 --> 01:05:04,522
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god. Okay.

1243
01:05:04,522 --> 01:05:06,087
LIAM: I hope these aren't your cousins.

1244
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:07,443
MARISHA: They might be.

1245
01:05:07,443 --> 01:05:08,576
TALIESIN: Well. They were a little--

1246
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,912
TRAVIS: Nobody's tried talking yet?

1247
01:05:09,912 --> 01:05:11,460
MARISHA: We'll figure that out.

1248
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,972
LAURA: We're kind of being ambushed. So...

1249
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:19,778
TALIESIN: That's kind of heavy. That's gonna be 24
points of damage,

1250
01:05:19,778 --> 01:05:21,620
and three points of psychic damage.

1251
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,467
LAURA: I don't think your cousins are fish
people.

1252
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:26,496
MARISHA: My cousins might be fish men.

1253
01:05:26,496 --> 01:05:28,784
LIAM: They could be werefish or...

1254
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:31,592
MARISHA: They could be anybody. They could be
werefish.

1255
01:05:31,592 --> 01:05:34,501
MATT: Gotcha. Okay, so you managed to fire
(gunshot) the third shot out from Animus.

1256
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:39,486
You see it blasts into the upper shoulder and
back portion of this fish-like creature.

1257
01:05:39,486 --> 01:05:47,191
(growls) It does not look terribly happy.
But it is currently still bound by the various

1258
01:05:47,191 --> 01:05:51,359
thorny vines that have wrapped around it.
End your turn?

1259
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,542
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm just gonna crawl a couple
feet into the ropes in that direction.

1260
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:58,256
MATT: Okay.

1261
01:05:58,256 --> 01:05:59,640
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna keep rope-swinging.
There we are.

1262
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,740
MATT: There you go. All righty, that brings us to
Grog.

1263
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:11,075
TRAVIS: After getting hit by the water elemental,
can I go, Hey! What do you want?

1264
01:06:11,075 --> 01:06:13,739
MATT: The water elemental just (gurgling growls).

1265
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:16,719
TRAVIS: Fuck it. You got saltwater in my eyes; I
would like to rage!

1266
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,177
MATT: Okay.

1267
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:19,438
TRAVIS: I go into a rage.

1268
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:21,511
MARISHA: It's not me, Grog. It's not me.

1269
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,054
TRAVIS: Oh, I hadn't thought about that.

1270
01:06:23,054 --> 01:06:24,210
(all laugh)

1271
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,164
TRAVIS: And I beat the shit out of it with the
dwarven hammer. Two hits.

1272
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:28,329
MATT: Go for it. Two strikes.

1273
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:30,380
TRAVIS: Are these at disadvantage? Or I'm right up
there?

1274
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,125
MATT: No, you're melee, you're fine.

1275
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,604
TRAVIS: Hey! Reckless attack.

1276
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:34,544
MATT: Okay.

1277
01:06:34,544 --> 01:06:35,245
LAURA: Oh, my.

1278
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:39,924
LIAM: Hells yeah.

1279
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:41,315
TRAVIS: 23.

1280
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:42,390
MATT: That hits.

1281
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:57,150
TRAVIS: Nice. 17.

1282
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:00,612
MATT: 17 damage. Okay. Now your last strike?

1283
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:06,325
TRAVIS: God, those are balls! They're not literal
balls. 22.

1284
01:07:06,325 --> 01:07:07,344
MATT: That hits.

1285
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:12,771
LAURA: Nice!

1286
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:15,080
TRAVIS: 24. 24 points of damage.

1287
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,843
MATT: 24 points of damage? Okay, nice. So you
start bludgeoning its watery form. Even though you

1288
01:07:18,843 --> 01:07:22,549
see the water splashing around, and it's soaking
everything in the vicinity, you are still watching

1289
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:27,055
as each blow forces the creature to kinda shift
and move, and you hear this (gurgling sound) kind

1290
01:07:27,055 --> 01:07:30,266
of dull thud sound, and a pained noise seems to
emit from

1291
01:07:30,266 --> 01:07:32,142
this elemental creature with each impact.

1292
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:34,137
TRAVIS: You can do better than that.

1293
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,192
MATT: Does that end your turn?

1294
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:36,040
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1295
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:41,149
MATT: All righty. That brings us to the rest of
the crew. So these guys-- the water has now pushed

1296
01:07:41,149 --> 01:07:46,804
them past a bit. They are moved and they're
starting to try and swim their way to the edge of

1297
01:07:46,804 --> 01:07:51,929
the ship, and they're starting to actually-- Let's
see what their rolls are for their athletics.

1298
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:56,237
Natural 20, nice. Okay, so they both make their
way up to the side of this side of the ship and

1299
01:07:56,237 --> 01:08:00,130
latch onto the edge, right beside Keyleth and
Taryon.

1300
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,403
SAM: Oh, great.

1301
01:08:03,403 --> 01:08:05,146
MARISHA: Can I say something to him?

1302
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:06,747
MATT: Yeah, as both (grunts) get out of the water,
they're

1303
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:09,784
pulling up right alongside you, pulling 
blades out.

1304
01:08:09,784 --> 01:08:14,401
MARISHA: Hi! Kaitiyaki. Water Ashari?

1305
01:08:14,401 --> 01:08:17,439
MATT: You hear them just growl as they pull their
blades out, and continue.

1306
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,651
MARISHA: Hm. Hm.

1307
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:22,722
LIAM: Kick his ass.

1308
01:08:22,722 --> 01:08:24,181
TRAVIS: Yeah, we tried to talk.

1309
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:26,519
MATT: So for this one, each of them are gonna make
two strikes

1310
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,039
against each of you with their rapiers.

1311
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,233
SAM: Oh, great.

1312
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:32,052
MATT: Taryon, that is a 21?

1313
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:33,012
SAM: Yeah.

1314
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:34,007
MATT: And a 21.

1315
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:34,876
SAM: Yeah.

1316
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:37,520
MATT: I rolled the same number twice in a row.
So you take--

1317
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,032
TRAVIS: What's your AC there, big guy?

1318
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,308
SAM: 15.

1319
01:08:41,308 --> 01:08:44,344
MATT: Nine points of piercing damage and five
points of piercing damage.

1320
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:45,321
SAM: Sure.

1321
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,238
MATT: As it just thrust--

1322
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:47,190
SAM: Ow!

1323
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,612
MATT: -- holding onto the side of the ship's
armor, thrusting the rapier into you, scraping

1324
01:08:49,612 --> 01:08:51,229
past your armor. One catches you in the hip.

1325
01:08:51,285 --> 01:08:52,600
SAM: Ugh.

1326
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,643
TRAVIS: Ooh.

1327
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:56,605
MATT: Keyleth, the other one's gonna make two
strikes against you. That's gonna be--

1328
01:08:56,605 --> 01:08:57,575
MARISHA: Cousins?

1329
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:58,327
MATT: An eight?

1330
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:00,897
MARISHA: No? Oh. Nope, that misses.

1331
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:02,255
MATT: And a 27.

1332
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:03,943
MARISHA: Yeah.

1333
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:07,835
MATT: And that's gonna hit you for ten points of
piercing damage.

1334
01:09:07,835 --> 01:09:09,520
MARISHA: Okay. That's-- yeah.

1335
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,301
MATT: And it looks like their ascent has stopped
and they're just right now happy to just continue

1336
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:19,201
to pierce these two stowaways that are gripping
onto the side of the ship. This one stumbles

1337
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:25,129
across the rest of the chain. And turning and
seeing you guys there on the edge, Vax as you dart

1338
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:30,966
around the side of Trinket, it's gonna move,
avoid the bear, step across, and attempt to

1339
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:34,320
attack you twice with the rapier, once with the
dagger.

1340
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:34,989
LIAM: Sure.

1341
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:36,297
MARISHA: Jeez Louise.

1342
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,676
MATT: So the dagger's gonna be 11?

1343
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:39,395
LIAM: No.

1344
01:09:39,395 --> 01:09:40,512
MATT: Not very good.

1345
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:41,307
LIAM: That's a no.

1346
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:43,056
MATT: However, that is a 26.

1347
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:44,363
LIAM: That hits. Uncanny Dodge.

1348
01:09:44,363 --> 01:09:46,554
MATT: And a 19.

1349
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:47,729
LIAM: No.

1350
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:51,467
MATT: No. All right, so, they get one rapier
strike towards you. That is going to be nine

1351
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:52,963
points of piercing damage.

1352
01:09:52,963 --> 01:09:53,799
LIAM: Halved.

1353
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:57,435
MATT: As it just cuts across the center of your
armor in the midsection. It doesn't actually get

1354
01:09:57,435 --> 01:10:00,457
the skin, but it's enough of an impact where you
can feel a bruise coming.

1355
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,246
LIAM: Tight.

1356
01:10:02,246 --> 01:10:06,126
MATT: All righty. Ending their turn, that brings
us to Keyleth.

1357
01:10:06,126 --> 01:10:07,882
MARISHA: Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat?

1358
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:09,109
MATT: You are, yes.

1359
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:10,879
MARISHA: I'm gonna climb up that boat.

1360
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:14,005
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

1361
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:19,773
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good, 17 plus my athletics,
which is good, which is seven, so 24.

1362
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:22,525
MATT: Okay, so you get up on the edge of the ship,
it does get one attack of opportunity against you

1363
01:10:22,525 --> 01:10:26,956
as you move up. It's gonna slice at you with a
rapier. That is gonna be an 18.

1364
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:27,922
MARISHA: Miss.

1365
01:10:27,922 --> 01:10:28,598
SAM: Whoa.

1366
01:10:28,598 --> 01:10:29,281
MATT: Nice.

1367
01:10:29,281 --> 01:10:30,417
MARISHA: No. Hit. Sorry.

1368
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:31,911
MATT: Okay, there you go, that's all good.

1369
01:10:31,911 --> 01:10:33,801
That is ten points piercing damage.

1370
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,146
MARISHA: Okay.

1371
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:37,569
MATT: As the rapier just catches you in the back,
and you're like (groans), and you climb up and

1372
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:42,160
get back onto the edge of the ship. As you glance
around, you can see that there is the weird

1373
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:47,251
fish-looking guy in the center of the ship right now.
It's currently bound by the vines around him.

1374
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:50,726
MARISHA: Any sign that these could still be my
people? Pretty certain they're not.

1375
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:53,314
TRAVIS: I think you can let that go now.

1376
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:56,116
MATT: You're pretty sure there's not much of a
tribal sign--

1377
01:10:56,116 --> 01:10:57,451
MARISHA: Nothing?

1378
01:10:57,451 --> 01:11:00,199
MATT: -- that resembles anything Ashari-related
universally.

1379
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,323
MARISHA: Guys, real pirates!

1380
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:12,763
And then I'm going to do Control Water. And I'm
going to raise water 20 feet around me, and start

1381
01:11:12,763 --> 01:11:18,328
sinking this bitch. I want to sink this ship.
20 feet,

1382
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:23,178
just tidal waves coming over the boat,
and I'm sinking it.

1383
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:24,078
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1384
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:25,540
MATT: Control Water, what level is this?

1385
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,599
MARISHA: Fourth level.

1386
01:11:26,599 --> 01:11:28,833
LAURA: We could steal this ship. Okay.

1387
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,214
TALIESIN: It might have stuff.

1388
01:11:31,214 --> 01:11:34,980
MARISHA: Nope. I'm sinking it.

1389
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,286
MATT: Okay, as you get on the edge you begin to
pull your arms up, and as you do, you hands begin

1390
01:11:39,286 --> 01:11:44,232
to glow with a dull blue-turquoise color,
similar to the skin of this fish-like creature,

1391
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:50,874
and it glances over at you, and its jaw opens.
You can see this burbling sound as the edges of

1392
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:59,514
the water begin to rise up and splash and pour
into the ship, perpetually filling the lower,

1393
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:02,012
usually air-filled section of this ship.
And it begins to immediately

1394
01:12:02,012 --> 01:12:08,305
(thud) list a little bit to one side.

1395
01:12:08,305 --> 01:12:11,986
MARISHA: Do I have any movement, or is that it?
Probably getting up is my movement.

1396
01:12:11,986 --> 01:12:15,412
MATT: That's gonna be your action, and climbing up
is gonna be your movement.

1397
01:12:15,412 --> 01:12:16,606
So that's kinda where you are.

1398
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:17,980
MARISHA: Okay. Cool.

1399
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,093
MATT: You can maintain concentration on it.

1400
01:12:19,093 --> 01:12:20,261
TALIESIN: We're gonna want to break the chains.

1401
01:12:20,261 --> 01:12:21,739
MARISHA: I maintain concentration.

1402
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:26,026
MATT: You get the sense, it's gonna take a few
rounds, but if you keep at this, you'll probably

1403
01:12:26,026 --> 01:12:28,956
have a Â good chance of achieving your goal.

1404
01:12:28,956 --> 01:12:32,874
MARISHA: Cool. It's what I like to hear in life,
in general.

1405
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:35,127
LAURA: You might bring our ship down with it,
Keyleth.

1406
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:37,455
TRAVIS: If you keep at it, you might be able to
achieve your goal.

1407
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:38,795
MARISHA: No, it's localized.

1408
01:12:38,795 --> 01:12:41,059
LAURA: No, but, the chains attaching two ships.

1409
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:43,612
MARISHA: Eh. We've got time.

1410
01:12:43,612 --> 01:12:44,743
TALIESIN: That's the correct response.

1411
01:12:44,743 --> 01:12:47,098
LIAM: She says as she destroys everything.

1412
01:12:47,098 --> 01:12:48,485
TRAVIS: Yep, yeah, yep.

1413
01:12:48,485 --> 01:12:49,609
MARISHA: Destroy reality?

1414
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:55,445
MATT: Ending Keyleth's turn, it is now the crew's
go. So the crew here is gonna turn the ballistas

1415
01:12:55,445 --> 01:13:03,876
around, as the captain leaps off down and goes
behind the guy who attacked you, Vax. She pulls

1416
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:07,835
out a scimitar, rushes forward screaming,
"Yah!"

1417
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,324
and just does a full downward arc into the back.

1418
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:10,532
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1419
01:13:10,532 --> 01:13:11,568
LIAM: Adele Dazeem, ladies and gentlemen.

1420
01:13:11,568 --> 01:13:12,656
LAURA: Like Xena. (war cry)

1421
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:14,698
MARISHA: Adele Dazeem.

1422
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:16,819
LAURA: What does Xena do? (Xena fighting call)

1423
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:17,714
MATT: That is 18. That hits.

1424
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:18,288
TRAVIS: That's it.

1425
01:13:18,288 --> 01:13:19,120
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

1426
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,542
MATT: Second strike is a 23. Both hit.

1427
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:21,314
LIAM: She also breaks hearts.

1428
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,258
LAURA: Left and right.

1429
01:13:22,258 --> 01:13:23,077
LIAM: Left and right.

1430
01:13:23,077 --> 01:13:23,791
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

1431
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,842
LIAM: You can relate.

1432
01:13:24,842 --> 01:13:26,156
TRAVIS: Disappointed!

1433
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:37,286
MATT: That's better. 24 points of slashing damage.
That ends her turn. These two guys are gonna fire

1434
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:39,412
ballistas at the ship. (firing sound, splash)

1435
01:13:39,412 --> 01:13:41,816
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes!

1436
01:13:41,816 --> 01:13:45,323
MATT: One of them unfortunately just coasts off to
the edge and misses the ship.

1437
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:47,051
TRAVIS: Damn it! He's fired.

1438
01:13:47,051 --> 01:13:48,217
MATT: The other one is a natural 20.

1439
01:13:48,217 --> 01:13:48,945
TRAVIS: Boom!

1440
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:50,345
LAURA: Damn!

1441
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:54,404
MATT: Oof, that's gonna be nasty. That, yeah,
okay.

1442
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:55,297
TRAVIS: Wow.

1443
01:13:55,297 --> 01:14:04,675
MATT: That is 42 points of damage--

1444
01:14:04,675 --> 01:14:06,226
TRAVIS: Damn. From one of the ballistas?

1445
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:09,136
MATT: -- to the side of the ship. You watch as one
of these ballistas has a similar-looking, like,

1446
01:14:09,136 --> 01:14:14,971
giant iron arrow, but it's designed to just split
and destroy wood on impact. It's pierced,

1447
01:14:14,971 --> 01:14:17,724
but it seems to splinter out, so it hits,
and then breaks as it goes.

1448
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:18,783
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1449
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:24,942
MATT: And as it slams into the side of this ship,
just above where Taryon and the other guy

1450
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:29,972
are. You watch as it (crashing sound) slams and
wood splinters and breaks. The impact shakes the

1451
01:14:29,972 --> 01:14:34,354
side. I'm actually gonna ask both you and that guy
to make a strength saving throw.

1452
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:36,226
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

1453
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:40,329
SAM: That's sorta cocked, but that's okay,
I'll take it. That's a five.

1454
01:14:40,329 --> 01:14:41,533
MATT: Okay, both of you guys--

1455
01:14:41,533 --> 01:14:44,009
SAM: Maybe I'll use Luck, and go again.

1456
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:45,830
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1457
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,687
SAM: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten.

1458
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:53,607
MATT: Okay, that's two. That's enough to hold on.
The other guy did not make it. So you just hold

1459
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:57,380
on from the impact, the other guy (screams) falls
back and splashes into--

1460
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,951
SAM: You should've worn boat shoes!

1461
01:14:58,951 --> 01:15:03,152
(all laugh)

1462
01:15:03,152 --> 01:15:05,168
MATT: Perfect.

1463
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,255
LAURA: I like to picture you in full armor with
boat shoes on.

1464
01:15:07,255 --> 01:15:08,984
MARISHA: Boat shoes on!

1465
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:12,019
MATT: As you hold on, you watch as the ballista,
which has a chain attached to the back of it as

1466
01:15:12,019 --> 01:15:17,623
well, is now being ratcheted back. And as it slams
through and is pulled back, it's tearing sections

1467
01:15:17,623 --> 01:15:19,888
of the ship apart. And you can watch now,
as it's

1468
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:22,028
pulling down and breaking a whole section.

1469
01:15:22,028 --> 01:15:24,029
SAM: Jesus.

1470
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:29,348
MATT: That's gonna go ahead and end this
crewman's turn. This guy is gonna go ahead--

1471
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:37,582
crossbow and try to line it up, towards-- I can
only see the guy below, with disadvantage.

1472
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:41,952
Oh, it's a shame, it's a natural 20. And a 19,
actually. Still manages to hit, even with the

1473
01:15:41,952 --> 01:15:49,234
disadvantage from the fog cloud. Okay, that's
eight damage to that guy. All righty. And then

1474
01:15:49,234 --> 01:15:57,177
this guy over here is gonna move to the water
elemental and take a strike on it and misses.

1475
01:15:57,177 --> 01:16:00,718
(whoosh) It goes and strikes, but the water
elemental shifts out of the way, the blade moves

1476
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:04,376
past, without an impact. End of the round,
we have Taryon.

1477
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:05,594
SAM: Yeah!

1478
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:06,683
MARISHA: Taryon!

1479
01:16:06,683 --> 01:16:08,699
SAM: Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone,
right?

1480
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:12,162
MATT: Yeah, he's splashed back. Both of these guys
are in the water, back ten feet.

1481
01:16:12,162 --> 01:16:13,487
SAM: Oh, they're gone. Okay.

1482
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:14,346
MATT: Yeah.

1483
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:22,636
SAM: Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.

1484
01:16:22,636 --> 01:16:23,762
MATT: Okay, athletics check.

1485
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:25,186
SAM: Okay.

1486
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:26,669
TRAVIS: Watch this go bad.

1487
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:28,687
SAM: No, no. It's okay. 16?

1488
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:31,435
MATT: Yeah, that could climb up and get onto the
edge of the ship, right next to Keyleth,

1489
01:16:31,435 --> 01:16:35,165
who's currently concentrating. You see her eyes
kinda glowing, and her hands glowing with this

1490
01:16:35,165 --> 01:16:40,437
faint aqua-look as the water is now,Â immediately
to the right of her, curling up and splashing over

1491
01:16:40,615 --> 01:16:44,003
the bow of the ship, and just pouring into the
ship below.

1492
01:16:44,003 --> 01:16:54,773
SAM: So cool. So cool. Okay, I just yell back to
Doty, Get rid of the grappling hooks!

1493
01:16:54,773 --> 01:16:56,711
I don't know, I have no idea what I'm doing.

1494
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:57,927
MATT: Okay.

1495
01:16:57,927 --> 01:17:02,506
SAM: And then I see that the giant thing in front
of me, right? Do I see the thing?

1496
01:17:02,506 --> 01:17:06,422
MATT: You do see it, yeah. It's currently bound by
the series of thorny vines.

1497
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:10,746
SAM: Great. I'll reach into my magic bag,
and

1498
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:14,472
pull out a vial of acid and just throw it at the 
thing.

1499
01:17:14,472 --> 01:17:16,396
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack.
It is restrained,

1500
01:17:16,396 --> 01:17:18,041
so you have advantage on the
ranged attack roll.

1501
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,123
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1502
01:17:20,123 --> 01:17:23,674
SAM: What do I add?

1503
01:17:23,674 --> 01:17:26,764
MATT: Add your-- it should say under the class.

1504
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,422
SAM: My spell attack bonus?

1505
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:30,822
MATT: It should say under the class's ability.

1506
01:17:30,822 --> 01:17:32,583
SAM: It says--

1507
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:36,391
MATT: What's your bonus next to it on your sheet?
Under your attacks.

1508
01:17:36,391 --> 01:17:37,454
SAM: Oh! Oh, it says--

1509
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:38,504
MATT: It should be there.

1510
01:17:38,504 --> 01:17:39,545
SAM: No, it doesn't.

1511
01:17:39,545 --> 01:17:40,930
MATT: Doesn't? Ah, damn it.

1512
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:45,592
SAM: Oh, wait, no, it says it. But it's cut off.
It says, "DC one". I'm sure there's something

1513
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:48,367
after that, but are you talking about just to hit
it?

1514
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:51,077
MATT: Right. It's their saving throw. It's your
spell DC to get past it; I think is what it is.

1515
01:17:51,077 --> 01:17:52,083
It's not an actual ranged--

1516
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,148
SAM: Okay, so then it's 17.

1517
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:56,913
MATT: 17? Okay, good to know. Which, he has
disadvantage on it, which he rolled a one in the

1518
01:17:56,913 --> 01:17:58,201
first one, so no.

1519
01:17:58,201 --> 01:17:58,984
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1520
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:00,205
MATT: So go ahead and roll full damage.

1521
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:01,786
SAM: Great, so that's 7d6.

1522
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:04,755
MATT: Okay.

1523
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:05,620
SAM: Okay.

1524
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,651
MARISHA: LED six!

1525
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,372
LAURA: They're really pretty.

1526
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:12,085
TALIESIN: They're really fun. Yeah, I like it.
I know.

1527
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:14,541
MARISHA: LED. Six.

1528
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,506
SAM: 26.

1529
01:18:15,506 --> 01:18:16,922
MATT: 26 points of acid damage.

1530
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:17,461
TRAVIS: Wow.

1531
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:18,144
LAURA: Nice.

1532
01:18:18,144 --> 01:18:19,022
TALIESIN: That's good.

1533
01:18:19,022 --> 01:18:20,418
MATT: All righty.

1534
01:18:20,418 --> 01:18:22,263
TRAVIS: Does he let out a fishy scream?

1535
01:18:22,263 --> 01:18:24,702
MATT: You watch as you lob your vial, it
(shattering sound)

1536
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:26,097
burst across the creature's chest--

1537
01:18:26,097 --> 01:18:27,128
TALIESIN: (gurgling)

1538
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:29,715
MATT: --and the acid (burning sound) begins to
burn, burning

1539
01:18:29,715 --> 01:18:32,701
part of the vines that currently
keep it restrained, but--

1540
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:36,090
SAM: Oh, shit! Sorry, sorry! I don't know how this
stuff works!

1541
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:39,840
MATT: But it does burn. You see it (gurgling
grunts) trying desperately to break free,

1542
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,863
as you see the smoke of its burning flesh rise
up off its body (sizzling sound).

1543
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:46,166
SAM: Okay.

1544
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,252
MATT: End your turn, Taryon?

1545
01:18:47,252 --> 01:18:50,321
SAM: I have a bonus action. I'll use Sanctuary.
On myself.

1546
01:18:50,321 --> 01:18:55,671
MATT: Okay. There you go. And with that,
Doty's gonna go ahead and reach down and try and

1547
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:59,203
grab-- nope. Not with a four.

1548
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:03,613
As you see, (creaking noise) you hear the
metal kind of creaking,

1549
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:05,339
but not getting any sort of actual--

1550
01:19:05,339 --> 01:19:05,968
MARISHA: Aw.

1551
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:07,304
TALIESIN: Knees, not back.

1552
01:19:07,304 --> 01:19:08,432
MATT: I know.

1553
01:19:08,432 --> 01:19:09,623
TRAVIS: Lift with your knees.

1554
01:19:09,623 --> 01:19:10,560
TALIESIN: God, robot!

1555
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,502
MATT: All right, ending that round, that brings us
to the top. The rushing waters: the ships continue

1556
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:17,077
to move forward; both of these guys shift
backward.

1557
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:18,440
LIAM: Bye!

1558
01:19:18,498 --> 01:19:19,857
MATT: They're being left behind by the boats.

1559
01:19:19,857 --> 01:19:20,848
TALIESIN: Good!

1560
01:19:20,848 --> 01:19:26,402
MATT: They're trying to swim forward. That brings
us to Marid. Okay.

1561
01:19:26,402 --> 01:19:29,335
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this so for pretty
much a few months.

1562
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:33,239
MATT: So this guy is currently up in the side.
And he's looking around, he's gonna make a quick

1563
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:40,774
perception check, just to look around. He got shot
by you. He got shot by you. He's gonna go ahead

1564
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:46,572
and glance up in your direction. He's gonna go
ahead and use a Water Jet ability against you.

1565
01:19:46,572 --> 01:19:49,533
TALIESIN: All right.

1566
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:51,964
MATT: Actually, let's see here--

1567
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:53,201
TRAVIS: Water Jet.

1568
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:54,582
LAURA: (explosion sound)

1569
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:56,350
MATT: You know what, now? No, he's not.

1570
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:57,539
TRAVIS: He's not?

1571
01:19:57,539 --> 01:19:59,635
MATT: He is, but he's gonna use a Water Jet--

1572
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:01,198
LAURA: Is he not grappled anymore?

1573
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:03,349
MATT: He's still grappled. He's restrained,
but he can still do abilities.

1574
01:20:03,349 --> 01:20:04,722
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1575
01:20:04,722 --> 01:20:06,098
TALIESIN: We're fine.

1576
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:10,284
MATT: 60, fine. Yeah, you're up there, but it sees
the cluster in that direction. That's his own guy.

1577
01:20:10,284 --> 01:20:12,135
He won't do that.

1578
01:20:12,135 --> 01:20:12,930
TRAVIS: He wouldn't?

1579
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:15,860
LAURA: Ooh, honorable.

1580
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,260
MATT: Hold on, I'm trying to see what's the most
useful--

1581
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,628
SAM: Maybe they're family.

1582
01:20:18,628 --> 01:20:19,824
LAURA: Maybe they are.

1583
01:20:19,824 --> 01:20:22,996
MATT: He can't move. He can't angle it. It's
really frustrating for him.

1584
01:20:22,996 --> 01:20:24,679
LIAM: For him, right? For him? It's frustrating
for him.

1585
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:28,548
MATT: Yeah, for him.

1586
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:30,744
TRAVIS: It really frustrates him.

1587
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:33,252
MATT: And for that, he's gonna aim for Trinket and
Vax.

1588
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:34,093
LAURA: What is he doing, what?

1589
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:35,351
MATT: Aiming for Trinket and Vax.

1590
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:37,111
LAURA: (gasps)

1591
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:41,660
MATT: So, all of a sudden, it turns its head this
way, opens its mouth (hoarse gasp) and you watch

1592
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:48,056
as this small spiral of Â greenish energy begins to
swirl. And a singular burst of extremely

1593
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:54,745
accelerated water just (hard impact sound) fires
through the fog out of sight. You hear this

1594
01:20:54,745 --> 01:21:00,525
(whoosh) sound, and you turn just in time to watch
as it blasts towards both you and Trinket.

1595
01:21:00,525 --> 01:21:04,260
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
and Trinket as well.

1596
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,715
LIAM: Vax or Vex?

1597
01:21:07,715 --> 01:21:08,674
MATT: Vax.

1598
01:21:08,674 --> 01:21:09,788
LIAM: Vax. Yeah, you're fine.

1599
01:21:09,788 --> 01:21:10,552
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine.

1600
01:21:10,552 --> 01:21:11,920
LIAM: Oh, you're doing Trinket, right.

1601
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,653
LAURA: Whoa! Trinket rolled so good!

1602
01:21:13,862 --> 01:21:14,641
LIAM: 17.

1603
01:21:14,641 --> 01:21:15,352
MATT: 17?

1604
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:17,109
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, holda.

1605
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:18,184
SAM: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda.

1606
01:21:18,184 --> 01:21:21,579
LAURA: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. 20!

1607
01:21:21,579 --> 01:21:30,014
MATT: All righty. So Trinket manages to (whoosh)
duck down, taking half the damage.

1608
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:32,812
LAURA: He was very zen about that duck down.

1609
01:21:32,812 --> 01:21:34,948
TRAVIS: (Trinket groans)

1610
01:21:34,948 --> 01:21:40,934
LAURA: Matrix style, he's diving in. No.

1611
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:45,717
MATT: So 15 points of bludgeoning damage to
Trinket. 30 to you, Vax.

1612
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:49,873
LIAM: But halved, 'cause if I fail, it's halved.
If I succeed, it's zero.

1613
01:21:49,873 --> 01:21:52,878
It's a dexterity so it's Evasion.

1614
01:21:52,878 --> 01:21:54,173
MATT: Yeah. Evasion--

1615
01:21:54,173 --> 01:21:57,370
LIAM: Evasion is for dex saves. If I fail,
I take half damage,

1616
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,537
and if I succeed I take no damage.

1617
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:00,571
SAM: Ooh! That's sexy.

1618
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:01,436
MATT: Right.

1619
01:22:01,436 --> 01:22:02,554
LIAM: It's how I survive dragon fights.

1620
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:03,727
MATT: Yes, yes.

1621
01:22:03,727 --> 01:22:08,020
TRAVIS: (singing) How I survive dragon fights.

1622
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,481
SAM: Guys, we're having a water battle.

1623
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:10,333
LAURA: You guys!

1624
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,494
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this for so long.

1625
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:12,775
LAURA: Well, we're having a pirate battle.

1626
01:22:12,775 --> 01:22:13,665
TRAVIS: Super soaker!

1627
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:14,999
SAM/TALIESIN: Super soakers!

1628
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:18,277
TRAVIS: Super soaker 250, super soaker 500,
super soaker 1000. You remember those?

1629
01:22:18,277 --> 01:22:19,245
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1630
01:22:19,245 --> 01:22:20,943
SAM: Yeah. I didn't know they had gauges.

1631
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:21,789
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1632
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:22,731
LAURA: Yeah.

1633
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:24,506
MATT: So you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
However,

1634
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:28,007
you are pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.

1635
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:28,850
SAM: Ooh. Ooh.

1636
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,776
LAURA: Oh, no.

1637
01:22:29,776 --> 01:22:30,713
SAM: Off the ship?

1638
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,404
LIAM: Yeah.

1639
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:32,116
MATT: (whoosh) Off the edge of the ship.

1640
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:33,026
SAM: Oh! No!

1641
01:22:33,026 --> 01:22:34,029
LAURA: (gasps) Bro!

1642
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:37,831
MATT: He (splash) into the water below. (splash)
It's with such force, that you aren't even given a

1643
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,750
chance to grab at the ship. You're thrust off at
an arc.

1644
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,701
LIAM: Mm-hm.

1645
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:43,691
MATT: And (splash) into the water. (splash) into
the ocean--

1646
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:44,603
LAURA: Gosh, thank god Trinket ducked.

1647
01:22:44,603 --> 01:22:53,297
MATT: -- soaking you down into the wave.
The elemental creature swirls up and occupies

1648
01:22:53,297 --> 01:22:58,071
both the space of Grog and Trinket, and is going
to go ahead and turn it into a whelm. So it's

1649
01:22:58,071 --> 01:23:00,893
going to uh, attempt to whelm both of you,
and

1650
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:04,253
I need you and Trinket to make strength 
saving throws.

1651
01:23:04,253 --> 01:23:12,884
TRAVIS: Strength saving throws. I have advantage
because I'm raging. 26.

1652
01:23:12,884 --> 01:23:14,625
LAURA: 18.

1653
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:22,188
MATT: All righty. You guys, both pushed out of its
space. So it forces you out. However, you both

1654
01:23:22,188 --> 01:23:27,996
manage to escape any sort of damage as its giant
spiral, this whirlwind of water spins around and

1655
01:23:27,996 --> 01:23:31,450
you both barely force your way out of it before it
can do any serious damage to you.

1656
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,075
LAURA: Bearly.

1657
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:36,711
MATT: All right, that leads us to Vax's turn.

1658
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:43,082
LIAM: Okay, so in the water, click the boots,
and the wings shoot-out, and I explode up,

1659
01:23:43,082 --> 01:23:44,943
out of the water into the air.

1660
01:23:44,943 --> 01:23:45,887
SAM: Wow, so cool.

1661
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:47,065
MATT: Okay.

1662
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:51,209
LIAM: And I just start gunning it towards the guy
who knocked me in, right?

1663
01:23:51,209 --> 01:23:52,329
MATT: Okay.

1664
01:23:52,329 --> 01:23:57,297
LIAM: And when I'm about, I don't know, 30 feet
away from him, I'm gonna-- because I'm hasted I

1665
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,023
get 120 feet of movement just for regular
movement.

1666
01:24:00,023 --> 01:24:00,763
MATT: Yes.

1667
01:24:00,763 --> 01:24:02,958
LIAM: And when I'm within 40 feet, I'm gonna throw
Whisper at the guy.

1668
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,409
MATT: Okay, that will put you about there.

1669
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:07,917
LIAM: Yep.

1670
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,090
TRAVIS: Hit him. Hit him!

1671
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,377
LIAM: That's 26?

1672
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:12,116
MATT: 26? All righty, that hits.

1673
01:24:12,116 --> 01:24:14,458
LIAM: And I'm gonna bamf right up to him as I
hit.

1674
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,512
MATT: (poof)

1675
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:23,514
LIAM: That is just a little ten, plus-- 15.

1676
01:24:23,514 --> 01:24:27,129
MATT: 15 points of damage with that strike. Okay.

1677
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:31,930
LIAM: And I should have one more. So I used bonus
action for the wings, I did movement, I did

1678
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,947
action, so I've got one more action.

1679
01:24:33,947 --> 01:24:35,153
MATT: Your offhand attack, yeah.

1680
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,243
LIAM: Yeah. So I will shank him again.

1681
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:38,057
TRAVIS: Shank shank!

1682
01:24:38,057 --> 01:24:39,118
LAURA: Shank shank!

1683
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:40,693
SAM: Is that a new thing? Shank shank?

1684
01:24:40,693 --> 01:24:42,068
MATT: You have advantage on these strikes now.

1685
01:24:42,068 --> 01:24:43,428
Because you're right up against him, and he is
restrained.

1686
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:44,214
LIAM: 20.

1687
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:45,772
MATT: 20 hits. And you do get your Sneak Attack,
because of your advantage on him.

1688
01:24:45,772 --> 01:24:46,616
TRAVIS: No more dagger dagger dagger.

1689
01:24:46,616 --> 01:24:47,835
SAM: Just shank shank?

1690
01:24:47,835 --> 01:24:48,644
LAURA: It's just two. It's shank shank.

1691
01:24:48,644 --> 01:24:49,883
SAM: Okay.

1692
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:55,319
LIAM: That is just a nine! And I'll unload some
poison into him as well. The DC is 15.

1693
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:58,476
MARISHA: I feel like 'shank shank' is less
attractive on a t-shirt.

1694
01:24:58,476 --> 01:25:01,669
MATT: That is a nine. He does not succeed!

1695
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:04,955
LIAM: Okay, so he takes 2d10. Do I roll that,
or do you, Matty?

1696
01:25:04,955 --> 01:25:06,114
MATT: You roll that.

1697
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:07,037
LIAM: All right.

1698
01:25:07,037 --> 01:25:09,005
MATT: So what's the damage initially?

1699
01:25:09,005 --> 01:25:15,428
LIAM: It's nine. Plus 13 poison damage.

1700
01:25:15,428 --> 01:25:19,174
MATT: Okay, so 22. Are you gonna roll Sneak Attack
damage?

1701
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:21,878
LIAM: Why would I get that here? Is he up against
anybody?

1702
01:25:21,878 --> 01:25:23,326
MATT: No, you have advantage on him because he is
restrained.

1703
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:27,727
LIAM: Oh, advantage, yay, I love you.

1704
01:25:27,727 --> 01:25:31,714
MATT: And he is not immune to poison.

1705
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:37,278
LIAM: 20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt.

1706
01:25:37,278 --> 01:25:40,695
MATT: How much is that total?

1707
01:25:40,925 --> 01:25:42,109
LIAM: 20 for the sneak attack.

1708
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:46,809
MATT: 20 for the sneak attack. 20 plus 22.

1709
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:48,183
LAURA: You're attacking the guy?

1710
01:25:48,183 --> 01:25:49,435
MATT: We'll see if he maintains concentration.

1711
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,260
LAURA: How'd you get all the way over there?

1712
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:58,135
MATT: He does not. So. Let me double-check one
thing real fast, here,

1713
01:25:58,135 --> 01:26:01,109
because this will be interesting.

1714
01:26:01,109 --> 01:26:04,083
LIAM: Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank.

1715
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:08,188
LIAM/TALIESIN/LAURA/MARISHA: (singing) Shank your
booty. Shank your booty.

1716
01:26:08,188 --> 01:26:16,549
MATT: Okay, got you. So he loses concentration.
He is now poisoned and restrained. He has to make

1717
01:26:16,549 --> 01:26:21,530
a saving throw, actually, to see-- which he did
not. So yeah, still restrained.

1718
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:22,526
LAURA: Yes.

1719
01:26:22,526 --> 01:26:28,566
MATT: Whoof. That sucks. Okay, that ends Vax's
turn. Vex, you're up.

1720
01:26:28,566 --> 01:26:29,441
LAURA: Awesome.

1721
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:30,522
LIAM: Get him!

1722
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:37,239
LAURA: Cool, then since he's got my brother next
to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him

1723
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:45,459
better, and shoot him two times with my blazing
bowstring on the first one.

1724
01:26:45,459 --> 01:26:48,642
LIAM: She shouts as she flies through the air.

1725
01:26:48,642 --> 01:26:51,153
LAURA: Blazing bowstring! Activate!

1726
01:26:51,153 --> 01:26:52,702
MARISHA: (electric guitar sounds)

1727
01:26:52,702 --> 01:26:53,838
LAURA: Do I still get disadvantage?

1728
01:26:53,838 --> 01:26:55,028
MATT: You do, the fog is still present.

1729
01:26:55,028 --> 01:26:59,386
LAURA: Okay. 28.

1730
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:03,045
MATT: 28 hits. Second attack?

1731
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:06,906
LAURA: Second attack is just-- can I do regular?

1732
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:11,513
MATT: Yes, that's fine.

1733
01:27:11,513 --> 01:27:12,391
LAURA: 18.

1734
01:27:12,391 --> 01:27:18,990
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.

1735
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:22,077
LAURA: 12 with three points of lightning damage.

1736
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:23,630
TRAVIS: Did you add your Hunter's Mark?

1737
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:36,481
LAURA: I'm about to. 13 additional. And then ten
with the blazing bowstring--

1738
01:27:36,481 --> 01:27:38,413
nine more with the blazing bowstring.

1739
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:39,527
MATT: Nice, all right.

1740
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:40,745
LAURA: And then my second attack--

1741
01:27:40,745 --> 01:27:45,895
MATT: Correct.

1742
01:27:45,895 --> 01:27:49,807
LAURA: 11 plus three lightning.

1743
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:52,129
MATT: All righty.

1744
01:27:52,129 --> 01:27:54,099
LAURA: I don't get Sneak Attack again, but I do
get Hunter's Mark.

1745
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,927
MATT: You do get Hunter's Mark, yes.

1746
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:57,404
LAURA: And three more for Hunter's Mark.

1747
01:27:57,404 --> 01:28:02,606
MATT: Nice. So, after he's stabbed in the side,
and the poison pulses through his system,

1748
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:05,681
turns around, and as the arrow slams into him,
burst of flame

1749
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:08,943
and lightning arcs through his body.

1750
01:28:08,943 --> 01:28:13,998
LAURA: And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can
see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket,

1751
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:15,648
for my bonus action--

1752
01:28:15,648 --> 01:28:17,607
MARISHA: (gasps)

1753
01:28:17,607 --> 01:28:20,297
LAURA: -- run forward and attack the guy on the
edge of the ship.

1754
01:28:20,297 --> 01:28:21,190
LIAM: Is it a leap year?

1755
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,718
MARISHA: This hasn't happened in like 20 games.

1756
01:28:22,718 --> 01:28:23,970
LAURA: I know, I know.

1757
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,199
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1758
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,725
MATT: Is Trinket doing just a regular
attack?

1759
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:30,866
LAURA: Yeah, because it's my bonus, so he can just
do one attack.

1760
01:28:30,866 --> 01:28:39,043
MATT: Because if you wanted to, instead of going
for a damaging attack, you can go for a shove.

1761
01:28:39,043 --> 01:28:40,582
LAURA: Oh, I could? I didn't think I was allowed
to do that.

1762
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,856
MATT: Yeah, you can do it, you can sacrifice an
attack for a shove strike. It doesn't do damage.

1763
01:28:42,856 --> 01:28:44,400
LAURA: I want him to do that. That's what I wanted
him to do.

1764
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,962
MATT: I was wondering if that's what you were
going for.

1765
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:53,952
Okay, so go ahead and roll an athletics
check for Trinket.

1766
01:28:53,952 --> 01:28:56,997
LAURA: Athletics... is that strength? That's just
five.

1767
01:28:56,997 --> 01:29:05,240
MATT: Five? Okay, yeah, so Trinket goes up and
slams into the guy, and he gets pushed against the

1768
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,371
side of the ship, but not with enough force to
shove him over the edge,

1769
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:09,830
and he (grunt) catches himself.

1770
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:11,799
LAURA: So Trinket just stands up, he's got his
paws on his chest.

1771
01:29:11,799 --> 01:29:14,173
MATT: Just pressing (growls) on there, yeah.

1772
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:18,498
LAURA: Growls loudly into his face.

1773
01:29:18,498 --> 01:29:20,547
LIAM: (growls)

1774
01:29:20,547 --> 01:29:21,884
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up.

1775
01:29:21,884 --> 01:29:24,189
LAURA: I mean, that's scary, a big bear.
Especially if these guys are on the sea.

1776
01:29:24,189 --> 01:29:26,301
They don't see bears very often.

1777
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:28,994
TALIESIN: All right. That guy's still in the
vines, right?

1778
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,257
MATT: Correct, yes.

1779
01:29:30,257 --> 01:29:34,348
TALIESIN: He's becoming a problem, though.
Okay, I'm going to, if I can pull this off,

1780
01:29:34,348 --> 01:29:40,092
is it possible that I can break the rope that I'm
currently holding onto and do a little Errol Flynn

1781
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:42,524
like fly down to the bottom of the boat?

1782
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:44,002
MATT: You can do that, yeah.

1783
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:47,535
TALIESIN: Is it possible that the rope I have to
shoot is in between me and him?

1784
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:50,997
MATT: Uh... sure.

1785
01:29:50,997 --> 01:29:53,134
MARISHA: You going to kill two birds with one
stone?

1786
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:57,855
TALIESIN: I'm going to use a piercing shot,
and I'm going to try to do both with one shot and

1787
01:29:57,855 --> 01:30:00,267
Errol Flynn this shit.

1788
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:01,941
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Oh shit!

1789
01:30:02,008 --> 01:30:03,508
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check as part of
this.

1790
01:30:03,508 --> 01:30:04,728
MARISHA: Errol Flynn this shit, is that what you
said?

1791
01:30:04,728 --> 01:30:06,249
MATT: This is specifically the kind of shit
acrobatics is for.

1792
01:30:06,249 --> 01:30:10,266
TRAVIS: Totally. 100%. Swashbuckling.

1793
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:12,730
TALIESIN: Acrobatics... that's a 23.

1794
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:15,126
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and take it-- still at
disadvantage.

1795
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:16,383
TALIESIN: Still at disadvantage.

1796
01:30:16,383 --> 01:30:18,322
MATT: Because of the fog.

1797
01:30:18,322 --> 01:30:20,064
MARISHA: Oh man, now you're in an Angelina Jolie
movie.

1798
01:30:20,064 --> 01:30:22,095
TALIESIN: Nope.

1799
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:23,084
MATT: Nope?

1800
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,728
TALIESIN: So this is gonna be funny, because I was
using the Animus.

1801
01:30:24,728 --> 01:30:25,974
MATT: Yes.

1802
01:30:25,974 --> 01:30:30,814
TALIESIN: So depending on how mean you wanna be
here, I'm gonna take my 2d6.

1803
01:30:30,814 --> 01:30:32,169
MATT: Oh, you misfire?

1804
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:32,929
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1805
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:34,164
MATT: (laughs)

1806
01:30:34,164 --> 01:30:39,696
TALIESIN: So this is gonna be funny. I'm gonna
take my 2d6, and that's six points of psychic

1807
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:41,923
damage to me, that's cool, that's cool.

1808
01:30:41,923 --> 01:30:45,390
MARISHA: What if one day you died because of
that?

1809
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:49,611
MATT: Okay, so you use your piercing shot to shoot
both at him and to shoot the-- or to shoot the

1810
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,105
rope and then swing down?

1811
01:30:51,105 --> 01:30:56,472
TALIESIN: Yes. So does the psychic damage mean I
let go of the rope I'm holding on to? Or does it

1812
01:30:56,472 --> 01:30:59,751
not? Also, my feet are sticky and my hand has--

1813
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:02,206
MATT: Your feet are sticky, but your hands are
not.

1814
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:03,567
TALIESIN: But my hands are not.

1815
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,023
MATT: It's the blast of psychic energy. You know
what?

1816
01:31:05,023 --> 01:31:06,750
I'll say go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

1817
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,051
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm down for this.

1818
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:12,288
MATT: Yes, make a wisdom saving throw to see if
you can withstand the blast to your brain as your

1819
01:31:12,288 --> 01:31:13,864
vision goes white.

1820
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:15,808
TALIESIN: So that's an eight.

1821
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:17,180
LIAM: Goes in the drink.

1822
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,051
MATT: Nope.

1823
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:20,531
TALIESIN: Here's the next question: do I have any
chance of grabbing anything

1824
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:22,431
with my hands and feet on the way down?

1825
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:30,029
MATT: Unfortunately, no. What happens is,
as you grab the rope and you fire-- as you slash

1826
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:34,831
the rope and go to swing down, you go to fire,
and as you do, it backs up, and your vision just

1827
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:38,465
goes white and you feel your whole body go
instantaneously numb. You're not sure if you're

1828
01:31:38,465 --> 01:31:40,447
even holding the rope anymore. All of your--

1829
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:43,710
TALIESIN: So I'm just gonna wake up on the deck of
the floor of the boat.

1830
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:47,702
MATT: -- and the pain sears in your brain,
you hear the (heartbeat) the pulse of pain

1831
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:53,552
through, and as your vision comes to, it
clarifies, and color comes back just in time for

1832
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:59,322
you to see the surface of the ship rocketing
towards your face. (impact sound) And you slam

1833
01:31:59,322 --> 01:32:03,662
into the ground, straight across, landing prone at
the base of the ground

1834
01:32:03,662 --> 01:32:06,175
in front of the fish creature.

1835
01:32:06,175 --> 01:32:07,177
LAURA: Oh, no!

1836
01:32:07,177 --> 01:32:08,184
TRAVIS: It was so cool!

1837
01:32:08,184 --> 01:32:09,687
LAURA: That one was seriously bad.

1838
01:32:09,687 --> 01:32:12,258
SAM: Can I yell out, No! New best friend!

1839
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:15,325
MATT: You can. You take 12 points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall.

1840
01:32:15,325 --> 01:32:20,176
TALIESIN: 12 points of bludgeoning damage.
And can I burn a bonus action, am I okay, or--

1841
01:32:20,176 --> 01:32:28,770
MATT: You could use-- I mean, that was your
action, you land, yeah. You're still prone,

1842
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:31,771
but you can still use the rest of your attacks if
you want.

1843
01:32:31,771 --> 01:32:35,224
MARISHA: I'm sorry, <i>your</i> best friend?

1844
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:38,180
TALIESIN: I can use the rest of my actions?

1845
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:46,651
MATT: I mean, that was an attack. The piercing
shot. So you still have your two other attacks,

1846
01:32:46,651 --> 01:32:49,642
if you wanted to use them.

1847
01:32:49,642 --> 01:32:53,486
TALIESIN: Just because it hurts and I'm irritated,
I'm just gonna pull out Retort

1848
01:32:53,486 --> 01:32:55,921
and fire in the general direction.

1849
01:32:55,921 --> 01:32:58,359
MATT: Okay, so two more strikes, both at
disadvantage.

1850
01:32:58,359 --> 01:33:01,422
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1851
01:33:01,422 --> 01:33:03,367
SAM: (gunshot sounds)

1852
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:05,051
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not bad.

1853
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:06,270
MARISHA: What the fuck?

1854
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:07,174
TALIESIN: 28?

1855
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:08,655
MATT: 28 hits.

1856
01:33:08,655 --> 01:33:12,689
MARISHA: That's not as good.

1857
01:33:12,689 --> 01:33:13,880
TALIESIN: 16.

1858
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,116
MATT: 16 does not hit.

1859
01:33:16,116 --> 01:33:25,298
TALIESIN: Okay, so the 28 one does, though.
That's seven points of damage.

1860
01:33:25,298 --> 01:33:30,309
MATT: Seven points of damage. Got it. Okay.
So as you roll over on your back and pull out

1861
01:33:30,309 --> 01:33:37,074
Retort and just fire two shots, one just goes off
into the fog. You see it tear through the ship

1862
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:41,710
mast for a second, some wood splinters, the other
one, you hear the creature take the impact from

1863
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:44,980
the blow. You're not even really paying attention
where it's going, you're just hearing the sound

1864
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,969
and shooting in that direction. All right,
that'll end your turn, Percy?

1865
01:33:47,969 --> 01:33:49,198
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

1866
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:50,217
MATT: (laughs)

1867
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:52,184
TALIESIN: What a turn. What a terrible way to go.

1868
01:33:52,184 --> 01:33:53,395
MATT: Grog, you're up.

1869
01:33:53,395 --> 01:33:56,767
TRAVIS: I wanna keep hitting the water elemental.

1870
01:33:56,767 --> 01:34:01,666
MATT: All right. So, you turn towards it over
there. Go for it.

1871
01:34:01,666 --> 01:34:03,098
TRAVIS: Reckless attacks, please.

1872
01:34:03,098 --> 01:34:09,541
MATT: Yes.

1873
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,009
TRAVIS: First one's a 30.

1874
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:19,897
MATT: That'll hit.

1875
01:34:19,897 --> 01:34:22,677
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

1876
01:34:22,677 --> 01:34:23,843
MATT: All righty.

1877
01:34:23,843 --> 01:34:31,792
TRAVIS: Second attack. It's very methodical. 26.

1878
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,007
MATT: All righty.

1879
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:35,942
TRAVIS: Does that hit?

1880
01:34:35,942 --> 01:34:37,195
MATT: Yes.

1881
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,749
TRAVIS: And 17 points of damage.

1882
01:34:39,749 --> 01:34:44,256
MATT: 17 points of damage, all right. So you rush
in and slam twice in this elemental again.

1883
01:34:44,256 --> 01:34:48,436
You see its form with each hit is just
splattering water against the ground, and where

1884
01:34:48,436 --> 01:34:52,760
once it came up as this solid force of water,
it's starting to have difficulty keeping its form

1885
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,839
together. Where once it was focused genuinely on
you and Trinket, it seems to be lashing out now in

1886
01:34:57,839 --> 01:35:02,702
a frenzied state, it's just punching all around.
Does that finish your turn?

1887
01:35:02,702 --> 01:35:07,173
TRAVIS: Am I not good enough to hold your
attention? Yeah, that finishes my turn.

1888
01:35:07,173 --> 01:35:13,830
MATT: Okay. Got you. All right. This guy here's
gonna squeeze past the side.

1889
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:17,428
LAURA: Trinket attacks him on the way over.

1890
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:19,205
MATT: He hasn't moved away from Trinket yet.

1891
01:35:19,205 --> 01:35:21,129
LAURA: Damn it.

1892
01:35:21,129 --> 01:35:23,833
MATT: Actually, no, he's gonna squeeze this way
instead because Grog's on that side. He's gonna go

1893
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:30,161
ahead and move past the bear and let Trinket push
his weight into the side of the ship, and is going

1894
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:32,397
to go ahead and take three strikes at you, Grog.

1895
01:35:32,397 --> 01:35:32,977
TRAVIS: Yay!

1896
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:33,943
MATT: With advantage.

1897
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:36,906
TRAVIS: Another play-friend.

1898
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:39,022
MATT: That's gonna be two strikes against you and
one against Trinket.

1899
01:35:39,022 --> 01:35:41,608
First one with advantage is gonna be a 24.

1900
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:43,258
TRAVIS: Hits!

1901
01:35:43,258 --> 01:35:46,674
MATT: Dagger is gonna be a 15.

1902
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,368
TRAVIS: Misses. With advantage too?

1903
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:54,393
MATT: Yeah, his first attack roll was a one.
All right, so you take ten points of piercing

1904
01:35:54,393 --> 01:35:55,880
damage, reduced to five.

1905
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,920
TRAVIS: Okay.

1906
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,941
MATT: And then the other rapier attack's gonna go
against Trinket. Which is a natural one. Jesus.

1907
01:36:00,941 --> 01:36:01,909
TRAVIS: Wow.

1908
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:09,589
MATT: So he just swings and Trinket catches the
blade in his teeth, and he draws the rapier back,

1909
01:36:09,589 --> 01:36:11,824
which is now covered in bear slobber.

1910
01:36:11,824 --> 01:36:14,590
TRAVIS: This is not the time to choke, buddy.

1911
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:20,369
MATT: That ends his turn. This guy here is gonna
go ahead and turn to face off with Captain Adella.

1912
01:36:20,369 --> 01:36:23,719
He's gonna make three strikes against her.

1913
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:25,260
MARISHA: C'mon, Adele Dazeem.

1914
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,959
MATT: That's gonna hit. First rapier strike,
second rapier strike, and the dagger,

1915
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:30,404
all three hit, unfortunately.

1916
01:36:30,404 --> 01:36:31,463
LAURA: We're all such dicks.

1917
01:36:31,463 --> 01:36:33,430
TRAVIS: You guys are awful.

1918
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:35,848
MARISHA: We've got these shitty nicknames for
everyone.

1919
01:36:35,848 --> 01:36:42,820
MATT: 14, and, okay. Total of 21 points of damage
on her.

1920
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,072
TRAVIS: 21 points.

1921
01:36:44,072 --> 01:36:48,458
MATT: So as she tries to parry to the side,
the pirate just catches her off-guard and gets

1922
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:53,876
three good hits in, but Adella parries off to the
side, gets pushed back a bit, and then forces her

1923
01:36:53,876 --> 01:36:55,771
way forward, preparing her counter-attack.

1924
01:36:55,771 --> 01:36:57,395
TRAVIS: Come on!

1925
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,245
MATT: That brings us to--

1926
01:36:58,245 --> 01:36:59,994
TRAVIS: We should probably protect the captain.

1927
01:36:59,994 --> 01:37:00,805
MATT: -- Keyleth.

1928
01:37:00,805 --> 01:37:01,933
SAM: Okay.

1929
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:04,628
MARISHA: Oh, shit. We're still attached to this
boat, right?

1930
01:37:04,628 --> 01:37:05,890
SAM: Multiple times.

1931
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:08,941
MATT: Currently, yes. If you're still
concentrating on this,

1932
01:37:08,941 --> 01:37:11,142
the water's still pouring into it.

1933
01:37:11,142 --> 01:37:18,357
MARISHA: I am. How much slack do we have before I
start pulling our boat underwater, because I don't

1934
01:37:18,357 --> 01:37:21,956
want to be that-- kinda thought someone would
start--

1935
01:37:21,956 --> 01:37:27,247
MATT: It depends, right now it'll be probably two
rounds before it begins to genuinely start sinking

1936
01:37:27,247 --> 01:37:31,558
heavily. Depending on if the ballista get another
shot at the side or not.

1937
01:37:31,558 --> 01:37:37,064
MARISHA: I wanna keep doing this. Can I
concentrate my flooding of water so-- there's now

1938
01:37:37,064 --> 01:37:41,909
a hole in the side of the ship, under where Tary
was, right? I had to think not to say Scanlan.

1939
01:37:41,909 --> 01:37:43,524
MATT: Correct.

1940
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:52,176
MARISHA: I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood
it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can

1941
01:37:52,176 --> 01:37:59,954
I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the
gods from the wave come up and--

1942
01:37:59,954 --> 01:38:01,582
TALIESIN: Kind of like Fantasia?

1943
01:38:01,582 --> 01:38:03,685
MARISHA: -- take the fish-head guy?

1944
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:05,066
TRAVIS: What the shit?

1945
01:38:05,066 --> 01:38:08,703
MARISHA: Or can I at least try and flood that side
to where I can try and toss him over?

1946
01:38:08,703 --> 01:38:13,005
MATT: You can either choose to continue to flood
the ship, or use Control Water to attack the fish

1947
01:38:13,005 --> 01:38:16,184
character. One or the other.

1948
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:17,983
TRAVIS: Don't look at us, man.

1949
01:38:17,983 --> 01:38:22,596
MARISHA: Let me see if I can Control Water and
take a wave to toss him overboard.

1950
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,196
MATT: Toss him overboard?

1951
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:26,693
LAURA: He's a fish! That'll help him.

1952
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:28,187
MARISHA: He is a fish.

1953
01:38:28,187 --> 01:38:29,756
MATT: He is very plainly a fish-based creature.

1954
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:31,247
MARISHA: He is very definitely a fish.

1955
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:33,730
MATT: The lower half of his body is a swirl of
water.

1956
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,493
MARISHA: Oh, right.

1957
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:35,546
TRAVIS: So put him in the water.

1958
01:38:35,546 --> 01:38:37,835
LAURA: I don't think putting him in the water's
gonna help us very much.

1959
01:38:37,835 --> 01:38:38,903
TRAVIS: Water and water makes--

1960
01:38:38,903 --> 01:38:40,504
MARISHA: You know, I'll just keep sinking this
ship.

1961
01:38:40,504 --> 01:38:41,381
MATT: Okay.

1962
01:38:41,381 --> 01:38:42,887
MARISHA: I'm gonna keep concentrating.

1963
01:38:42,887 --> 01:38:44,674
LAURA: You could get rid of the fog.

1964
01:38:44,674 --> 01:38:45,331
MATT: Okay.

1965
01:38:45,331 --> 01:38:47,684
MARISHA: I can't do that right now.

1966
01:38:47,684 --> 01:38:51,723
MATT: The torrent of water continues to shove down
into the ship. You've redirected it. As it's

1967
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:55,148
pouring into the side, you use your other hand to
pick up another portion of water and start

1968
01:38:55,148 --> 01:38:59,008
spraying it into the wound that was left right
above, Taryon, you're getting sprayed by water

1969
01:38:59,008 --> 01:39:03,919
overhead as it's just traveling over you like an
Epcot Center water fountain.

1970
01:39:03,919 --> 01:39:05,242
MARISHA: You're good, right, Tary?

1971
01:39:05,242 --> 01:39:06,155
SAM: Yes?

1972
01:39:06,155 --> 01:39:06,963
MARISHA: All right.

1973
01:39:06,963 --> 01:39:08,681
SAM: This is so weird!

1974
01:39:08,681 --> 01:39:12,682
MARISHA: Good! This is like a Tuesday for us.

1975
01:39:12,682 --> 01:39:17,978
MATT: All right, so the crew on this side,
this guy's gonna go ahead and move up higher up

1976
01:39:17,978 --> 01:39:22,597
there and take a swing. Misses, unfortunately.
This guy's gonna take another crossbow shot down

1977
01:39:22,597 --> 01:39:25,368
at the one that's attacking the captain.
That will hit, actually.

1978
01:39:25,368 --> 01:39:27,615
TRAVIS: Yes! Get him!

1979
01:39:27,615 --> 01:39:29,367
LAURA: Get him!

1980
01:39:29,367 --> 01:39:36,382
MATT: All righty. And then these two guys are
gonna take two more ballista shots as they load

1981
01:39:36,382 --> 01:39:43,683
up, pull it back. This guy continues-- actually,
this guy doesn't get a shot, because he spent

1982
01:39:43,743 --> 01:39:47,538
the last round winching and pulling it back,
so he gets one shot retracting. This guy managed

1983
01:39:47,538 --> 01:39:55,122
to pull it back and take a secondary shot at the
ship. That hits. It's not a critical, but it's

1984
01:39:55,122 --> 01:40:06,311
still pretty decent. That is 14 points of damage
on the side of the ship. This one slams into it

1985
01:40:06,311 --> 01:40:11,180
maybe about five feet to the left. Keyleth,
actually all of you who are on the ship,

1986
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:15,147
you feel the impact as the second blow hits,
and it pulls out the side, this time much lower,

1987
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:20,086
and water is now really pushing, the ship is
slowly starting to capsize to one side.

1988
01:40:20,086 --> 01:40:26,343
That ends that group's turn.

1989
01:40:26,343 --> 01:40:29,844
SAM: I've read about this. Many of us will die.

1990
01:40:29,844 --> 01:40:31,584
(all laugh)

1991
01:40:31,584 --> 01:40:32,610
MATT: Tary, it's your turn.

1992
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,460
SAM: My turn?

1993
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,505
MATT: Yes.

1994
01:40:34,505 --> 01:40:39,510
SAM: Okay. Is there water all over the deck,
is it hard to move, is it okay?

1995
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:43,265
MATT: I mean, it's wet, and the deck is currently
listing to one side.

1996
01:40:43,265 --> 01:40:44,119
SAM: Okay.

1997
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:45,800
LAURA: Is it listing towards Keyleth and--

1998
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,926
MATT: It's listing this way.

1999
01:40:46,926 --> 01:40:48,339
TRAVIS: Boat shoes!

2000
01:40:48,339 --> 01:40:50,532
SAM: Yeah, those are like impervious to water.

2001
01:40:50,532 --> 01:40:53,048
(all laugh)

2002
01:40:53,048 --> 01:40:58,603
SAM: Okay. Once again, I'll yell back at Doty and
just say,

2003
01:40:58,603 --> 01:41:05,848
Ahh! The thing with the grappling hooks again!

2004
01:41:05,848 --> 01:41:07,714
MATT: Doty actually does succeed this turn.

2005
01:41:07,714 --> 01:41:09,141
(all cheer)

2006
01:41:09,141 --> 01:41:14,369
MATT: Doty lifts it out, and now that it's
starting to pull, the chains are very taut,

2007
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:20,215
as this ship lists, the ship's being pulled a
little ways towards it, the chains are strained,

2008
01:41:20,215 --> 01:41:25,152
so as soon as Doty pulls it up, it just goes
firing off the side and plunges off the water to

2009
01:41:25,152 --> 01:41:30,503
the other side. The ship's now beginning to slowly
turn this way as the other chain is now tugging it

2010
01:41:30,503 --> 01:41:36,295
from that direction, and this is now listing to
that side. So, what are you doing, Tary?

2011
01:41:36,295 --> 01:41:46,375
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste as my action.
And I get a second action, now,

2012
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:47,945
because I'm hasted, right?

2013
01:41:47,945 --> 01:41:50,319
MATT: You get to use a second action that's a
melee attack.

2014
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:51,340
SAM: It has to be a melee attack?

2015
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:53,151
MATT: Melee attack, disengage, hide...

2016
01:41:53,151 --> 01:41:55,403
SAM: Can I use-- it said I could use a magic
item.

2017
01:41:55,403 --> 01:41:57,920
MATT: Yeah.

2018
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,798
SAM: Or use an item, use an item.

2019
01:41:59,798 --> 01:42:02,909
MATT: Yeah, use an object.

2020
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:06,645
SAM: Oh, use an object, not an item. I can't use
my ring or anything, right?

2021
01:42:06,645 --> 01:42:09,894
MATT: I'll say, for the purposes of this? Sure.
Why not?

2022
01:42:09,894 --> 01:42:20,588
SAM: Okay, so I'm hasted, I will use, I pick up
the Ring of the Ram, and I'll ram the fish-man.

2023
01:42:20,588 --> 01:42:21,740
TRAVIS: Oh, yes!

2024
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,681
LAURA: Oh, nice!

2025
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:24,201
MATT: Okay. How many charges does it have?

2026
01:42:24,201 --> 01:42:25,610
TRAVIS: Ring of the Ram, that's been a while.

2027
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:28,084
SAM: Three charges, right? So I can use two?

2028
01:42:28,084 --> 01:42:30,510
MATT: You can use as many charges as you want that
the ring holds.

2029
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:32,480
It should tell you up to a certain amount--

2030
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,904
SAM: It has three charges.

2031
01:42:33,904 --> 01:42:35,395
MATT: Okay.

2032
01:42:35,395 --> 01:42:39,959
SAM: Well, it says I can use an action to expend
one to three of its charges.

2033
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:45,263
Okay. I'll do all three, right?

2034
01:42:45,263 --> 01:42:48,252
(all laugh)

2035
01:42:48,252 --> 01:42:53,377
MATT: All right. So, it is still restrained,
so go ahead and roll with advantage

2036
01:42:53,377 --> 01:42:56,462
an attack roll plus seven.

2037
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,432
SAM: Ooh. 19.

2038
01:42:58,432 --> 01:42:59,586
MATT: With advantage?

2039
01:42:59,586 --> 01:43:01,967
SAM: Oh. Natural 20.

2040
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:05,309
(all cheer)

2041
01:43:05,309 --> 01:43:14,306
MATT: Oh, shit. Well. Okay. Roll 6d10 force
damage.

2042
01:43:14,306 --> 01:43:17,792
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 6d10?

2043
01:43:17,792 --> 01:43:19,166
TALIESIN: How many do you need?

2044
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:22,719
MATT: Well, then we double what he rolled,
because it's a critical.

2045
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,892
MARISHA: Six, you need six?

2046
01:43:26,892 --> 01:43:32,053
TRAVIS: And that's force damage.

2047
01:43:32,053 --> 01:43:40,851
SAM: Okay. 35. 70.

2048
01:43:40,851 --> 01:43:48,267
MATT: 70 points of force damage against the
creature. So as you focus on your ring, there's a

2049
01:43:48,267 --> 01:43:54,020
burst of divine white-looking energy that turns
into this giant plate-like shield in front of you,

2050
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:59,084
and it just stays there. You're like, huh? And
suddenly it thrusts forward, and out the front of

2051
01:43:59,084 --> 01:44:06,308
it, like a portal, a giant spectral ram-head just
slams into the chest, throwing it off the ship,

2052
01:44:06,308 --> 01:44:10,164
as it screams, it just turns into sea foam.

2053
01:44:10,164 --> 01:44:12,169
(all cheer)

2054
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:13,863
TRAVIS: You killed it!

2055
01:44:13,863 --> 01:44:16,345
MATT: It's scattered into the ocean across from
you. It is destroyed.

2056
01:44:16,345 --> 01:44:22,326
SAM: Can it be like a kid who's holding a rifle,
but not up to him, so it hits him and it really

2057
01:44:22,326 --> 01:44:25,111
throws me back a little?

2058
01:44:25,111 --> 01:44:30,504
MATT: Which, yeah, sure. Roll a dexterity saving
throw.

2059
01:44:30,504 --> 01:44:31,865
SAM: Five.

2060
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:33,191
MATT: Off the ship, into the water.

2061
01:44:33,191 --> 01:44:36,640
SAM: Yes!

2062
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,330
MATT: Splash! Into the water.

2063
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,873
TRAVIS: Back in the drink again!

2064
01:44:41,873 --> 01:44:43,444
MARISHA: Are there still bad guys left?

2065
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:44,105
LAURA: Yeah.

2066
01:44:44,105 --> 01:44:48,436
MATT: There are. There's two over here, and
there's two currently in the water below.

2067
01:44:48,436 --> 01:44:49,694
Ending your turn--

2068
01:44:49,694 --> 01:44:51,756
MARISHA: But nothing left on the ship, right?

2069
01:44:51,756 --> 01:44:52,525
LAURA: That we see?

2070
01:44:52,525 --> 01:44:53,447
MARISHA: That we see?

2071
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:58,984
MATT: Correct. These guys are trying to swim
forward. That was cocked. Nope. These guys,

2072
01:44:58,984 --> 01:45:01,449
at the top of the round, get pushed back.

2073
01:45:01,449 --> 01:45:02,598
MARISHA: Bye!

2074
01:45:02,598 --> 01:45:05,363
MATT: Taryon--

2075
01:45:05,363 --> 01:45:08,268
SAM: I lost Alter Self when I hasted.

2076
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:12,577
MATT: Yeah, so you're just generally swimming,
but you also float back in the ocean. You're now

2077
01:45:12,577 --> 01:45:15,942
caught in the water behind, so the ship carries on
without you.

2078
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,645
TALIESIN: And that was the last anyone saw of
Taryon Darrington.

2079
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,689
(all laugh)

2080
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:20,441
MATT: All right.

2081
01:45:20,441 --> 01:45:24,504
MARISHA: He got his $50,000 worth.

2082
01:45:24,504 --> 01:45:28,063
MATT: The water elemental's going to go ahead and
take two slam attacks.

2083
01:45:28,063 --> 01:45:31,231
SAM: You there! Hello.

2084
01:45:31,231 --> 01:45:34,066
MATT: It's taking a slam attack against Grog,
it's taking a slam attack against the pirate.

2085
01:45:34,066 --> 01:45:35,279
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2086
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:37,593
MATT: So against Grog, it has advantage on you
because you used reckless.

2087
01:45:37,593 --> 01:45:38,379
TRAVIS: Yep.

2088
01:45:38,379 --> 01:45:40,282
MATT: That is a 23.

2089
01:45:40,282 --> 01:45:41,722
TRAVIS: Hits.

2090
01:45:41,722 --> 01:45:46,544
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
eight.

2091
01:45:46,544 --> 01:45:47,321
TRAVIS: Okay.

2092
01:45:47,321 --> 01:45:54,640
MATT: And against the pirate, that hits.
And the elemental reaches around, and as it

2093
01:45:54,640 --> 01:46:00,521
punches Grog in the face, it slams the other
pirate in the head, its fist engulfing his head,

2094
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:05,146
and he just kind of stands there, trying to find
a way out, and it just drowns him while it's

2095
01:46:05,146 --> 01:46:08,318
standing, and it drops the body to the ground.

2096
01:46:08,318 --> 01:46:09,635
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

2097
01:46:09,635 --> 01:46:11,093
TRAVIS: Oh, it killed him?

2098
01:46:11,093 --> 01:46:12,521
MATT: Yeah, it lashed out.

2099
01:46:12,521 --> 01:46:13,588
LAURA: One of our guys?

2100
01:46:13,588 --> 01:46:16,012
MATT: Did enough damage-- no, one of the pirates.

2101
01:46:16,012 --> 01:46:18,903
LAURA: Oh, shit. He is untameable.

2102
01:46:18,903 --> 01:46:21,174
MATT: Vax, you're up.

2103
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:26,594
LIAM: You know when you look at a cat that's
alarmed because it's nervous and all the hair is

2104
01:46:26,594 --> 01:46:33,284
puffed out? Vax's feathers are all going like
pffft, watching Keyleth wreck the boat, I could

2105
01:46:33,284 --> 01:46:38,897
fucking watch you do this all day. Up into the
air, and I go and get Tary out of the water.

2106
01:46:38,897 --> 01:46:39,951
SAM: Aw!

2107
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:41,689
MATT: You go grab Tary.

2108
01:46:41,689 --> 01:46:45,235
LIAM: And I'm gonna pick him up and dump him back
on our boat, towards the back of the ship.

2109
01:46:45,235 --> 01:46:46,918
MATT: Okay, carrying him, we'll say you're at half
speed,

2110
01:46:46,918 --> 01:46:49,577
so that gets you just to the edge of the ship.

2111
01:46:49,577 --> 01:46:56,984
LIAM: Cool. I'm good. Wait, no, do I have an
action left? Can I use Divine Sense right now?

2112
01:46:56,984 --> 01:46:59,422
MATT: As you're hasted, you have the haste
action...

2113
01:46:59,422 --> 01:47:00,974
LIAM: Yeah, I am hasted.

2114
01:47:00,974 --> 01:47:02,170
MATT: I'll say you can use Divine Sense, sure.

2115
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:04,793
LIAM: Okay. I pat him down and go, we're good,
we're good,

2116
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:07,949
and I'm just gonna make sure he's not a demon.

2117
01:47:07,949 --> 01:47:09,185
MATT: Oh. Taryon.

2118
01:47:09,185 --> 01:47:09,851
LIAM: Yes.

2119
01:47:09,851 --> 01:47:10,741
MATT: Okay.

2120
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:14,200
TRAVIS: A demon? What?

2121
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,219
LAURA: Why a demon?

2122
01:47:15,219 --> 01:47:17,817
MARISHA: What? Why would you think he's a demon?

2123
01:47:17,817 --> 01:47:22,974
SAM: Guys, the conclusion of the epic series
Shades of Magic, A Conjuring of Light, was just

2124
01:47:22,974 --> 01:47:31,748
released, so go pick it up. It's put out by Tor
books, a leading publisher of science fiction and

2125
01:47:31,748 --> 01:47:34,980
fantasy for over three decades.

2126
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:38,022
MATT: Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.

2127
01:47:38,022 --> 01:47:43,340
LAURA: Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the
fucking ground.

2128
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:44,413
MATT: Okay.

2129
01:47:44,413 --> 01:47:47,503
LAURA: And I say, are you good?

2130
01:47:47,503 --> 01:47:49,811
TALIESIN: It was worth it. Good.

2131
01:47:49,811 --> 01:47:52,309
LAURA: Lovely. Get off this boat. And I'll fly
over

2132
01:47:52,309 --> 01:47:55,317
and try to help out the fight on the other side.

2133
01:47:55,317 --> 01:48:00,570
MATT: Okay. We'll say that's 20... 40...
yeah, you can get over here.

2134
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,536
LAURA: Okay.

2135
01:48:01,536 --> 01:48:03,715
MATT: You'd still be just above the fray.

2136
01:48:03,715 --> 01:48:06,406
LAURA: And then I'll shoot some arrows at--

2137
01:48:06,406 --> 01:48:09,361
MATT: There's one guy left, and the elemental.

2138
01:48:09,361 --> 01:48:11,286
LAURA: I'll shoot 'em at the guy.

2139
01:48:11,286 --> 01:48:13,421
MATT: Okay, go ahead for two strikes on that.

2140
01:48:13,421 --> 01:48:19,212
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, disadvantage, too?

2141
01:48:19,212 --> 01:48:20,803
MATT: The fog is still around, so yes.

2142
01:48:20,803 --> 01:48:29,361
LAURA: Oh, damn it. Okay.

2143
01:48:29,361 --> 01:48:31,273
TRAVIS: Oh, one of them was a--

2144
01:48:31,273 --> 01:48:40,800
LAURA: Yeah, but. 20 on the first one, and 15 plus
seven on the second one. 22.

2145
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,532
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

2146
01:48:42,532 --> 01:48:44,004
LAURA: Awesome.

2147
01:48:44,004 --> 01:48:44,967
MARISHA: You have a d3?

2148
01:48:44,967 --> 01:48:46,250
SAM: I need a d3.

2149
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:47,894
TALIESIN: It's a d6.

2150
01:48:47,894 --> 01:48:49,518
MARISHA: It's a d6 cut in half.

2151
01:48:49,518 --> 01:48:52,748
SAM: Wait, two, four, six or something? Okay.

2152
01:48:52,748 --> 01:48:55,009
LAURA: Oh, Jesus, this is terrible, this is
terrible.

2153
01:48:55,009 --> 01:48:59,386
TALIESIN: There is actually a d3 that has two
ones, two twos, and two threes.

2154
01:48:59,386 --> 01:49:14,273
LAURA: 17. Plus three lightning damage. And
then... 16 plus two lightning damage. And then for

2155
01:49:14,273 --> 01:49:17,804
my bonus action, Trinket's gonna-- and it was
Sneak Attack,

2156
01:49:17,804 --> 01:49:19,491
because there's something next to him, huh?

2157
01:49:19,491 --> 01:49:20,485
MATT: Correct.

2158
01:49:20,485 --> 01:49:24,183
LAURA: (cackles) Five for sneak attack!

2159
01:49:24,183 --> 01:49:25,084
MATT: All righty.

2160
01:49:25,084 --> 01:49:27,657
LAURA: And then Trinket will attack him too.

2161
01:49:27,657 --> 01:49:29,082
MATT: Roll an attack for Trinket.

2162
01:49:29,154 --> 01:49:30,632
LAURA: Okay.

2163
01:49:30,632 --> 01:49:34,008
LIAM: (bear noises)

2164
01:49:34,008 --> 01:49:38,666
LAURA: Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite
attack?

2165
01:49:38,666 --> 01:49:40,599
MATT: Whichever one you decide.

2166
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:43,014
LAURA: Sure, it's a bite attack. A 24.

2167
01:49:43,014 --> 01:49:48,458
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

2168
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:49,887
LAURA: It's 11.

2169
01:49:49,887 --> 01:49:55,601
MATT: 11. As both arrows staple, one into the
guy's knee, he falls down to the ground on one

2170
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:58,739
knee. The other one hits him in the side of the
body, and he looks up

2171
01:49:58,739 --> 01:50:01,718
just as Trinket chomps down over his head.

2172
01:50:01,718 --> 01:50:02,956
(all cheer)

2173
01:50:02,956 --> 01:50:07,440
MATT: And just crunches down. You watch as his
skull collapses with the force of the bear's jaw,

2174
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,715
and the arms just go limp at the sides.

2175
01:50:11,715 --> 01:50:14,857
(all cheer)

2176
01:50:14,857 --> 01:50:18,483
MATT: Trinket then shakes him a bit, and his limp
body just goes whoompf, whoompf, just slamming and

2177
01:50:18,483 --> 01:50:21,121
breaking into the side of the ship, and then drops
it on the ground,

2178
01:50:21,121 --> 01:50:23,526
and Trinket turns around and
looks in your direction.

2179
01:50:23,526 --> 01:50:25,756
LAURA: Good job, boy!

2180
01:50:25,756 --> 01:50:27,130
LIAM: That made us all so happy.

2181
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,883
LAURA: Yeah, it's great.

2182
01:50:28,883 --> 01:50:30,241
MARISHA: See a guy get thrashed.

2183
01:50:30,241 --> 01:50:32,148
LAURA: I wish Scanlan could've been here to see
that.

2184
01:50:32,148 --> 01:50:34,953
MATT: All righty.

2185
01:50:34,953 --> 01:50:37,590
SAM: 87 episodes. One kill.

2186
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:38,945
LAURA: He's had more than one.

2187
01:50:38,945 --> 01:50:41,601
MATT: Two of the guys are trying to swim,
but they're not able to keep up. You just watch

2188
01:50:41,601 --> 01:50:49,427
them slowly vanish behind you in the fog.
All right, Percy?

2189
01:50:49,427 --> 01:50:53,021
TALIESIN: The water elemental's still a problem,
I take it?

2190
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:54,938
MATT: You can see it still lashing out, yes.

2191
01:50:54,938 --> 01:50:56,649
TRAVIS: And there's one hook left.

2192
01:50:56,649 --> 01:51:03,671
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand up, dust myself off,
pull out Bad News, take careful aim-- slightly

2193
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:06,812
irritated aim at that water elemental, and see
what happens.

2194
01:51:06,812 --> 01:51:09,428
MATT: Go for it. Disadvantage on the shot.

2195
01:51:09,428 --> 01:51:11,986
TALIESIN: Disadvantage on the shot.

2196
01:51:11,986 --> 01:51:14,573
TRAVIS: Has the fog not dissipated because
fish-head got done with?

2197
01:51:14,573 --> 01:51:15,592
LAURA: No.

2198
01:51:15,592 --> 01:51:22,838
TALIESIN: Not yet. I'm actually going to spend a
grit to gain my advantage back.

2199
01:51:22,838 --> 01:51:27,371
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2200
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:33,678
TALIESIN: Come on. Thank god I didn't do that too
weird. That's 20.

2201
01:51:33,678 --> 01:51:35,042
MATT: 20 hits.

2202
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:41,235
TALIESIN: I'm also gonna blow through most of
Cabal's Ruin, 'cause that's funny. I know,

2203
01:51:41,235 --> 01:51:56,970
I say that a lot. So that's standard damage,
is 15 points of damage, plus where is--

2204
01:51:56,970 --> 01:52:02,994
MARISHA: 1d4 plus four... 1d6 lightning damage per
charge expended.

2205
01:52:02,994 --> 01:52:10,466
TALIESIN: Okay, 1d6 per charge. You know? Let's
end this. Should we just end this?

2206
01:52:10,535 --> 01:52:16,417
MARISHA: That's good. Lightning's bad for water.
Not that I'd know.

2207
01:52:16,417 --> 01:52:19,202
TALIESIN: I figured it would be. I'm just gonna
blow eight of the charges,

2208
01:52:19,202 --> 01:52:21,533
so do you have five more--

2209
01:52:21,533 --> 01:52:29,957
MARISHA: Yeah, I do. Five more, of course.
Dream come true, make it happen.

2210
01:52:29,957 --> 01:52:31,731
LAURA: If this doesn't end it...

2211
01:52:31,731 --> 01:52:39,058
TALIESIN: So plus (counting) 23 points of
lightning damage on top of that.

2212
01:52:39,058 --> 01:52:44,895
MATT: Okay, so as you bring Bad News down and aim
across the way, fire the bullet, it blasts across,

2213
01:52:44,895 --> 01:52:49,364
and you guys see this glow of electrical energy
that just shoots through the air, the bullet

2214
01:52:49,364 --> 01:52:55,501
enhanced by the Cabal's Ruin vestige enchantment.
As it blasts into the side of the elemental,

2215
01:52:55,501 --> 01:52:59,800
the elemental gets blown back through the air,
and as it does, it just vaporizes.

2216
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,716
(all cheer)

2217
01:53:03,716 --> 01:53:06,290
MARISHA: Is that everyone done?

2218
01:53:06,368 --> 01:53:09,794
MATT: All the enemies currently seem to be not on
the ship, or dragging behind.

2219
01:53:09,794 --> 01:53:11,412
However, (creaking noise)

2220
01:53:11,412 --> 01:53:15,627
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop, I'm going to wave,
and I'm going to go walk over and start looking

2221
01:53:15,627 --> 01:53:18,348
to see if I can see what that glow is. I'm going
to deactivate this,

2222
01:53:18,348 --> 01:53:19,924
because I want to loot this ship.

2223
01:53:19,924 --> 01:53:21,487
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

2224
01:53:21,487 --> 01:53:31,092
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's better. That's 25.

2225
01:53:31,092 --> 01:53:38,023
MATT: 25. You glance in the side, and you see now,
there is a singular small palantÃ­r-type orb,

2226
01:53:38,023 --> 01:53:41,863
but smaller, that is a foggy gray color on the
inside that's slowly swirling, and you can see

2227
01:53:41,863 --> 01:53:44,840
it's gathering condensation and mist around it.

2228
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:48,106
TALIESIN: Does there seem to be any mechanism for
turning it off or otherwise?

2229
01:53:48,106 --> 01:53:50,511
MATT: It looks like it's just embedded into it.

2230
01:53:50,511 --> 01:53:52,146
MARISHA: Take it with us, take it with us.

2231
01:53:52,146 --> 01:53:54,385
TALIESIN: I'm going to at least try and pick it
up, and--

2232
01:53:54,385 --> 01:53:55,675
MATT: Make a strength check.

2233
01:53:55,675 --> 01:53:56,671
TALIESIN: Okay.

2234
01:53:56,671 --> 01:53:58,330
LIAM: While he's busy, I'm gonna jet over next to
Keyleth.

2235
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:00,204
MATT: Okay.

2236
01:54:00,204 --> 01:54:01,849
LIAM: Oh, are we in combat rounds?

2237
01:54:01,849 --> 01:54:03,051
MATT: We're going to stay in order for a second.

2238
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:03,925
LIAM: Oh, okay.

2239
01:54:03,925 --> 01:54:04,777
MATT: There is a bit of a--

2240
01:54:04,777 --> 01:54:05,696
TALIESIN: That's adorable.

2241
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,530
MARISHA: That's sad.

2242
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:07,370
TALIESIN: Three.

2243
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:09,905
MATT: (straining sound) You feel something pop in
your back shoulder,

2244
01:54:09,905 --> 01:54:12,901
and your right arm gets a little numb.

2245
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:13,958
TALIESIN: That's so mean.

2246
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:15,846
(all laugh)

2247
01:54:15,846 --> 01:54:17,248
LIAM: It's like when you just reach out to pick up
something--

2248
01:54:17,248 --> 01:54:21,048
MARISHA: Yeah, you never know. Getting old, man.

2249
01:54:21,048 --> 01:54:25,413
TALIESIN: There's no way to--

2250
01:54:25,413 --> 01:54:29,688
MATT: As you go over to it, you see it's there,
but it's currently held in place by something

2251
01:54:29,688 --> 01:54:35,128
that's beneath the orb, or at least it's either
adhered or glued to or held there, you just don't

2252
01:54:35,128 --> 01:54:36,344
have the strength to lift it.

2253
01:54:36,344 --> 01:54:37,830
TALIESIN: There's gotta be a way to turn this
off.

2254
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:38,803
MATT: So that's your turn.

2255
01:54:38,803 --> 01:54:39,700
MARISHA: I shout to--

2256
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:40,673
MATT: It's Grog's turn, actually.

2257
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:41,408
MARISHA: Sorry.

2258
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:48,217
TRAVIS: I go over to the harpoon hook, and like,
fuck this harpoon hook. Can I try and get it out

2259
01:54:48,217 --> 01:54:50,515
of the ship with my strength?

2260
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:53,939
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll a strength check.
With advantage, because you are raging.

2261
01:54:53,939 --> 01:54:58,113
TRAVIS: Hey. 25.

2262
01:54:58,113 --> 01:55:00,320
MATT: One-handed.

2263
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,488
LAURA: Hey!

2264
01:55:01,488 --> 01:55:06,678
MATT: (tink, fwoomp) And it just flies out of your
grip from the tension out of the ship. You have to

2265
01:55:06,678 --> 01:55:09,342
pull your hand back 'cause the-- one of the giant
gnarled edges of it

2266
01:55:09,342 --> 01:55:10,902
almost take your arm off in the process.

2267
01:55:10,902 --> 01:55:12,274
TRAVIS: (gasp)

2268
01:55:12,274 --> 01:55:14,338
LAURA: You almost lost that gauntlet!

2269
01:55:14,338 --> 01:55:18,663
MATT: It tears a section of the edge of this boat
off. Just the railing on the side kind of pulls

2270
01:55:18,663 --> 01:55:20,420
through it immediately.

2271
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,460
TRAVIS: I'll pay for that.

2272
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:24,158
MATT: Trinket has to pull off to the side and the
one guy kind of backs up immediately as it shoots

2273
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:29,357
off into the water below. For you guys, the ship,
now that it doesn't have the tension to the side,

2274
01:55:29,357 --> 01:55:32,449
is now capsizing very quickly and turning on the
side.

2275
01:55:32,449 --> 01:55:33,857
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

2276
01:55:33,857 --> 01:55:35,417
TRAVIS: I feel like I did something bad.

2277
01:55:35,417 --> 01:55:37,031
MARISHA: That was cool!

2278
01:55:37,031 --> 01:55:37,980
TRAVIS: Oopsie.

2279
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,163
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

2280
01:55:39,163 --> 01:55:48,047
MARISHA: I say: Hey guys! Cruises are really
trashy! (laughs)

2281
01:55:48,226 --> 01:55:49,373
TRAVIS: Jokes while you're doing that.

2282
01:55:49,373 --> 01:55:51,849
MARISHA: And I still have Control Water going.

2283
01:55:51,849 --> 01:55:53,295
LIAM: Tip your waiters.

2284
01:55:53,295 --> 01:55:59,895
MARISHA: Can I flush out the bottom of the cruise
ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the

2285
01:55:59,895 --> 01:56:03,938
bow with what water is there? Just kind of
(whoof)?

2286
01:56:03,938 --> 01:56:05,825
TALIESIN: Like a spigot.

2287
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:08,721
MATT: You're kinda off to the side. You can look
down, it's not very well-lit on the inside at all.

2288
01:56:08,721 --> 01:56:13,320
Like, it is not lit on the interior. You do have
your elven darkvision for a few feet, so you have

2289
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:18,249
to glance over and look into the room below,
but right now all you're seeing is seafoam and

2290
01:56:18,249 --> 01:56:20,317
ocean pouring into the side of the ship.

2291
01:56:20,317 --> 01:56:23,674
MARISHA: Okay, I stop sinking the boat. Because
we're not dying.

2292
01:56:23,674 --> 01:56:27,517
MATT: Okay. The ship is still sinking. You filled
it with water,

2293
01:56:27,517 --> 01:56:29,610
and currently the side of it has
been blasted twice.

2294
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:33,072
MARISHA: I bring the water up like a fountain of
wealth and youth.

2295
01:56:33,072 --> 01:56:35,203
Just coming up. Out of the bottom.

2296
01:56:35,203 --> 01:56:36,386
(all laugh)

2297
01:56:36,386 --> 01:56:36,991
MATT: Okay.

2298
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:37,869
LIAM: Wow.

2299
01:56:37,869 --> 01:56:38,540
MARISHA: Just other way.

2300
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,485
LIAM: Oh, boy!

2301
01:56:39,485 --> 01:56:40,908
MARISHA: Seeing what comes out from the bottom of
the ship.

2302
01:56:40,908 --> 01:56:41,632
MATT: Okay.

2303
01:56:41,632 --> 01:56:43,340
MARISHA: Hopefully not dead bodies or like--

2304
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:44,425
TALIESIN: (sings) It's rainin' men...

2305
01:56:44,425 --> 01:56:45,707
LAURA: I know, if there were slaves--

2306
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:48,132
MARISHA: Slave trade or something sad-- yeah,
like slave.

2307
01:56:48,132 --> 01:56:51,252
LAURA: Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to
Keyleth.

2308
01:56:51,252 --> 01:56:52,604
MARISHA: Oh, come on!

2309
01:56:52,604 --> 01:56:53,588
TRAVIS: It's just kids!

2310
01:56:53,588 --> 01:56:55,119
MARISHA: He's looking at his notes like it's a
thing!

2311
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:56,468
TRAVIS: It's just kids.

2312
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:58,732
EVERYONE: (laughs and groans)

2313
01:56:58,732 --> 01:56:59,915
TRAVIS: Kids and puppies!

2314
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:00,929
MARISHA: That's my worst nightmare!

2315
01:57:00,929 --> 01:57:01,720
MATT: You're terrible!

2316
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,545
TRAVIS: Kids and puppies!

2317
01:57:02,545 --> 01:57:03,505
LIAM: Gosh!

2318
01:57:03,505 --> 01:57:09,899
MATT: Okay, so as the water comes rushing up from
underneath, you see a lot of genuinely soaked food

2319
01:57:09,899 --> 01:57:13,790
items come shooting up, large chunks of broken
wood,

2320
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:19,178
what appear to be additional iron ballista spears.

2321
01:57:19,178 --> 01:57:20,553
MARISHA: Oh!

2322
01:57:20,553 --> 01:57:22,925
MATT: And lots of chain come firing up from the
inside.

2323
01:57:22,925 --> 01:57:24,842
MARISHA: Watch your head! Points!

2324
01:57:24,842 --> 01:57:30,503
MATT: Furniture, chairs, occasionally (water sound
effects) just pieces of broken things from the

2325
01:57:30,503 --> 01:57:33,325
interior. You're not seeing much else than that at
the moment.

2326
01:57:33,325 --> 01:57:39,818
MARISHA: Aw. These were lame pirates! No
treasure.

2327
01:57:39,818 --> 01:57:41,799
TALIESIN: Let's get the orb at the very least.

2328
01:57:41,799 --> 01:57:43,896
MATT: (sarcastically) Good pirates keep all their
treasure on their ship at all times.

2329
01:57:43,896 --> 01:57:45,063
MARISHA: Lame!

2330
01:57:45,063 --> 01:57:46,910
(all laugh)

2331
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:48,931
LIAM: Just hundreds and hundreds of NES classics.

2332
01:57:48,931 --> 01:57:50,399
LAURA: We really should've kept one of them
alive.

2333
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:52,440
TRAVIS: Do you wanna check the captain's quarters
before it all goes down?

2334
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,711
LAURA: Yeah! What if there's a map to treasure?

2335
01:57:54,711 --> 01:57:57,131
LIAM: (sighs) Looks like it's going down pretty
fast, though, yeah?

2336
01:57:57,131 --> 01:57:58,323
TRAVIS: Those of you on the boat--

2337
01:57:58,323 --> 01:57:59,639
TALIESIN: Doing it now-- yes, we want to it now
while there's

2338
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:02,453
an order of operations based on a die roll!

2339
01:58:02,453 --> 01:58:05,783
KEYLETH: I have control! I have control!

2340
01:58:05,783 --> 01:58:06,837
MATT: Taryon!

2341
01:58:06,837 --> 01:58:07,767
SAM: Yes?

2342
01:58:07,767 --> 01:58:10,141
MATT: Anything you wish to add to this
circumstance? You're now soaking wet, but your

2343
01:58:10,141 --> 01:58:14,218
winged savior has lifted you down onto the edge of
the ship.

2344
01:58:14,218 --> 01:58:17,566
LIAM: (ting)

2345
01:58:17,566 --> 01:58:19,069
TALIESIN: (sings) And I would do anything for
love.

2346
01:58:19,069 --> 01:58:21,036
SAM: How many of you can fly?

2347
01:58:21,036 --> 01:58:23,209
LIAM: Two or three, give or take.

2348
01:58:23,209 --> 01:58:30,030
SAM: Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No,
I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need

2349
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:34,182
my assistance in cleaning up any of these
ruffians? Oh, also, one question.

2350
01:58:34,182 --> 01:58:35,089
LIAM: Yeah?

2351
01:58:35,089 --> 01:58:36,923
SAM: Did I hurt the beast?

2352
01:58:36,923 --> 01:58:38,969
LIAM: Man, you did great! You knocked that guy
clear off!

2353
01:58:38,969 --> 01:58:39,690
SAM: Really?

2354
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:40,325
LIAM: Yeah.

2355
01:58:40,325 --> 01:58:41,243
SAM: I killed it!

2356
01:58:41,243 --> 01:58:42,197
LIAM: That's a good start, man.

2357
01:58:42,197 --> 01:58:43,423
SAM: What was it?

2358
01:58:43,423 --> 01:58:44,319
LIAM: What was it?

2359
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:45,084
SAM: Yes!

2360
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:47,048
LIAM: Oh, you need to ask the white-haired one.
I dunno.

2361
01:58:47,048 --> 01:58:47,881
SAM: Okay!

2362
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:49,487
TALIESIN: Oh, that's me!

2363
01:58:49,487 --> 01:58:50,727
SAM: Was it bad?

2364
01:58:50,727 --> 01:58:52,818
LIAM: The worst!

2365
01:58:52,818 --> 01:58:55,240
MATT: All right, so you spend your turn
conversing.

2366
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:55,739
LIAM: Yes.

2367
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:56,594
SAM: Pretty much!

2368
01:58:56,594 --> 01:58:57,800
LIAM: Six seconds of dialogue, right there!

2369
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:03,646
MATT: All right, we'll say for the pace of things
here, guys, the ship is maybe 30 seconds from

2370
01:59:03,646 --> 01:59:06,311
fully sinking into the water. Anybody you guys
wanna--

2371
01:59:06,311 --> 01:59:07,510
LAURA: 30 seconds?

2372
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:09,704
LIAM: I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm
gonna go and land next to Keyleth.

2373
01:59:09,704 --> 01:59:10,799
MATT: Okay.

2374
01:59:10,799 --> 01:59:14,260
TALIESIN: See if we can grab the orb. I'm gonna
run downstairs and see if I can see paperwork in

2375
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:18,177
the captain's quarters or anything-- or run in the
captain's quarters and just do a massive loot,

2376
01:59:18,177 --> 01:59:19,452
really, just as quick as I can.

2377
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:21,755
MATT: Investigation check with disadvantage.
The room is currently tilted pretty heavily,

2378
01:59:21,755 --> 01:59:24,488
and everything has slid and collided onto one
side of the room.

2379
01:59:24,488 --> 01:59:26,303
It's just a giant pile of broken furniture.

2380
01:59:26,303 --> 01:59:28,508
MARISHA: I said I balanced it out and that I'm
kind of doing that.

2381
01:59:28,508 --> 01:59:30,128
TRAVIS: You want me to jump over there and go get
the orb?

2382
01:59:30,128 --> 01:59:30,822
LAURA: Yeah!

2383
01:59:30,822 --> 01:59:32,997
MARISHA: We also kinda put a bunch of holes into
the side of it.

2384
01:59:32,997 --> 01:59:34,422
MATT: Yeah, there are a bunch of holes in the
ship--

2385
01:59:34,422 --> 01:59:35,651
MARISHA: So I can only do so much.

2386
01:59:35,651 --> 01:59:40,580
MATT: Your Control Water can localize some cool
effects, but overall the ship itself has taken too

2387
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:42,007
much damage.

2388
01:59:42,007 --> 01:59:45,402
TRAVIS: Can I use my boots of Feral leaping to
leap from one ship to the other?

2389
01:59:45,649 --> 01:59:46,795
MATT: Sure, make an athletics check.

2390
01:59:46,795 --> 01:59:49,292
LAURA: I want to fly down and help Percy
investigate. If there's time.

2391
01:59:49,292 --> 01:59:51,782
LIAM: We're pretty flush already. Let's make it
quick.

2392
01:59:51,782 --> 01:59:55,097
TALIESIN: Well, there might be something magic.
Okay. My investigation check is 19.

2393
01:59:55,097 --> 01:59:56,635
MATT: 19 with disadvantage?

2394
01:59:56,635 --> 01:59:57,485
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2395
01:59:57,485 --> 02:00:02,396
MATT: Nice! All right, pulling from the inside and
rummaging through, you find--

2396
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:04,221
TALIESIN: Any papers I'm just gonna grab.

2397
02:00:04,221 --> 02:00:09,289
MATT: Yeah, you grab whatever papers you can,
there's a small leather tube, you grab that.

2398
02:00:09,289 --> 02:00:16,619
Looking about inside, there's a ring of keys.
You find a bunch of scattered coins throughout

2399
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:19,795
the room. It looks like there was a couple of
small chests that just opened up and--

2400
02:00:19,795 --> 02:00:24,025
TALIESIN: I'm looking more for magic, I don't care
about gold-- magic or weird.

2401
02:00:24,025 --> 02:00:25,155
MATT: Right.

2402
02:00:25,155 --> 02:00:27,564
TALIESIN: Catch the eye. Are the keys, like--

2403
02:00:27,564 --> 02:00:30,711
MATT: They look like some sort of opening device,
yeah.

2404
02:00:30,711 --> 02:00:32,751
TALIESIN: Oh, no. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna grab them
anyway.

2405
02:00:32,751 --> 02:00:35,211
MATT: Okay. So you grab the keys. Cool. All
right.

2406
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:36,746
TRAVIS: 22. To jump across.

2407
02:00:36,746 --> 02:00:40,529
MATT: To jump across, okay. So you make it across,
and you try and go underneath now. The ship, now,

2408
02:00:40,529 --> 02:00:44,021
not only is it listing to one side, but it's
starting to lift up a little bit.

2409
02:00:44,021 --> 02:00:46,323
MARISHA: I try to balance it as much as I can.

2410
02:00:46,323 --> 02:00:49,734
MATT: So you're slowing the process. Slowing it.

2411
02:00:49,734 --> 02:00:50,982
MARISHA: Yeah.

2412
02:00:50,982 --> 02:00:53,382
TRAVIS: Make my way to the orb. Rip it out.

2413
02:00:53,382 --> 02:00:58,484
MATT: The ship is also slowly moving behind the
other ship, as it's no longer maintaining speed.

2414
02:00:58,484 --> 02:01:00,825
All right, so what are you doing?

2415
02:01:00,825 --> 02:01:04,413
TRAVIS: I'm trying to make it to the orb that he
was too weak to pull out--

2416
02:01:04,413 --> 02:01:06,533
MATT: Strength check.

2417
02:01:06,533 --> 02:01:08,804
TALIESIN: I hope you pull something in your knee.

2418
02:01:08,804 --> 02:01:10,057
TRAVIS: Hah! 25.

2419
02:01:10,057 --> 02:01:11,136
TALIESIN: God damn it.

2420
02:01:11,136 --> 02:01:12,638
MATT: (popping sound)

2421
02:01:12,638 --> 02:01:14,269
TRAVIS: I got it! Throw it in the water?

2422
02:01:14,269 --> 02:01:17,389
TALIESIN: No! Let's keep it, let's bring it to the
other ship.

2423
02:01:17,389 --> 02:01:19,012
MARISHA: Put it in the Bag of Holding, Grog.

2424
02:01:19,012 --> 02:01:20,666
TRAVIS: In the Bag of Holding.

2425
02:01:20,666 --> 02:01:21,532
MATT: Okay.

2426
02:01:21,532 --> 02:01:24,748
TRAVIS: And I run, and I try and jump back to the
other boat.

2427
02:01:24,748 --> 02:01:26,158
MATT: Make an athletics check.

2428
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:27,460
TRAVIS: I'm not gonna make it, but--

2429
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,170
LAURA: You might.

2430
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:32,103
LIAM: You might.

2431
02:01:32,103 --> 02:01:33,574
TRAVIS: 23.

2432
02:01:33,574 --> 02:01:41,758
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20... You catch the edge and
are dangling on the side of the ship

2433
02:01:41,758 --> 02:01:43,220
as your fingers are right there.

2434
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,278
LIAM: Looney Tunes!

2435
02:01:44,278 --> 02:01:47,076
TRAVIS: (breathing hard) I'm good.

2436
02:01:47,076 --> 02:01:50,353
SAM: You could have flown.

2437
02:01:50,353 --> 02:01:52,041
TRAVIS: I swallowed the coin.

2438
02:01:52,041 --> 02:01:56,005
MATT: Percival, water is now starting to spill in
underneath you, and you're now about knee-deep

2439
02:01:56,005 --> 02:01:58,673
inside, and everything's-- all the papers that you
haven't already grabbed

2440
02:01:58,673 --> 02:02:00,280
are soaked and floating up at the top.

2441
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:03,555
TALIESIN: I'm gonna run out. There's-- oh, man.

2442
02:02:03,555 --> 02:02:06,381
I don't hear anything coming from down below,
do I?

2443
02:02:06,381 --> 02:02:08,217
MATT: Make a perception check.

2444
02:02:08,217 --> 02:02:12,238
LAURA: Did you ever hear that I wanted to go help
Percy investigate, was I able to do that?

2445
02:02:12,238 --> 02:02:14,254
MARISHA: Please tell me I didn't kill someone
innocent again.

2446
02:02:14,254 --> 02:02:18,059
MATT: Yeah, you could fly over. Because you're
behind him. As you rush in to help him, he has a

2447
02:02:18,059 --> 02:02:22,186
couple armfuls of things, the room is now about
knee-high with water and is tilting heavily to

2448
02:02:22,186 --> 02:02:28,534
this side, and there's just floating bits of paper
and soaked books and pieces of broken wood and

2449
02:02:28,534 --> 02:02:30,548
furniture-- the room is utter chaos.

2450
02:02:30,548 --> 02:02:32,052
LAURA: Anything interesting?

2451
02:02:32,052 --> 02:02:34,918
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know. Hold on. I'm gonna
listen for it.

2452
02:02:34,918 --> 02:02:37,010
MARISHA: Hopefully no innocent people.

2453
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:37,994
TALIESIN: Perception check.

2454
02:02:37,994 --> 02:02:40,034
SAM: (muffled) Help me, I'm an orphan!

2455
02:02:40,034 --> 02:02:41,864
TALIESIN: You're terrible. 17.

2456
02:02:41,864 --> 02:02:47,109
MATT: 17? You take a listen. Through all the
splashing of water, the sound of wood creaking,

2457
02:02:47,109 --> 02:02:50,265
and the ocean outside, you don't hear anything.

2458
02:02:50,265 --> 02:02:51,799
LAURA: What are you listening for?

2459
02:02:51,799 --> 02:02:55,636
TALIESIN: I show the keys. I'm worried there's a
cage down there.

2460
02:02:55,636 --> 02:03:00,948
I still have the spider boots, so I'm holding on.

2461
02:03:00,948 --> 02:03:01,656
MATT: Okay.

2462
02:03:01,656 --> 02:03:03,339
LAURA: Can I hear anything with my elven ears?

2463
02:03:03,339 --> 02:03:05,033
MATT: Make a perception check.

2464
02:03:05,033 --> 02:03:06,923
TALIESIN: You've got an elven perception check.

2465
02:03:06,923 --> 02:03:08,676
LIAM: They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.

2466
02:03:08,676 --> 02:03:12,001
LAURA: What do your elf eyes see? Oh, nothing.

2467
02:03:12,001 --> 02:03:14,551
LIAM: It was a one.

2468
02:03:14,551 --> 02:03:15,855
LAURA: It was a one.

2469
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:19,461
MATT: Okay, yeah. You go down and listen,
and as soon as you do the water splashes up into

2470
02:03:19,461 --> 02:03:21,664
your ear, and you get a bunch of salt water in the
ear canal.

2471
02:03:21,664 --> 02:03:24,145
Up in your nose a bit. You're like, ugh.

2472
02:03:24,145 --> 02:03:26,077
LAURA: That was awful. We should get out.

2473
02:03:26,077 --> 02:03:31,221
TALIESIN: I'm gonna hand her a bunch of stuff,
including some of my things, and be back-- I'm

2474
02:03:31,221 --> 02:03:33,475
gonna try and see if I can just--

2475
02:03:33,475 --> 02:03:34,616
MATT: Spider-boot down.

2476
02:03:34,616 --> 02:03:36,283
TALIESIN: Spider-boot and see if I can hold my
breath and look.

2477
02:03:36,283 --> 02:03:37,533
LAURA: Don't drown, Percival.

2478
02:03:37,533 --> 02:03:39,997
TALIESIN: I'm gonna grab, and try and use the
lenses on my mask

2479
02:03:39,997 --> 02:03:41,706
to even get a clear shot of what's under there.

2480
02:03:41,706 --> 02:03:43,046
MATT: Okay.

2481
02:03:43,046 --> 02:03:48,172
MARISHA: And I'm just trying to visualize with the
last ten minutes that I have of Control Water to

2482
02:03:48,172 --> 02:03:51,378
clear the bottom of this passage.

2483
02:03:51,378 --> 02:03:56,524
MATT: So you can do that. You can prevent,
slowing the sinking, to part water.

2484
02:03:56,524 --> 02:03:59,791
MARISHA: The rushing-in, that's what I want to do.
I wanna part right where Percy's heading.

2485
02:03:59,791 --> 02:04:05,922
MATT: Okay. As you do that, the ship begins to
list even further back and at an angle, and you

2486
02:04:05,922 --> 02:04:11,018
watch as the front of it comes upward, and
everything on the ship begins to slide past--

2487
02:04:11,018 --> 02:04:11,957
TRAVIS: Yes!

2488
02:04:11,957 --> 02:04:14,166
MATT: -- in the direction of Keyleth and Vax.

2489
02:04:14,166 --> 02:04:15,722
MARISHA: Sorry, physics.

2490
02:04:15,722 --> 02:04:16,826
LIAM: Get off!

2491
02:04:16,826 --> 02:04:19,595
MATT: Can I have you both make dexterity saving
throws, if you could.

2492
02:04:19,595 --> 02:04:20,400
MARISHA: What, me too?

2493
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,767
MATT: Yes.

2494
02:04:21,767 --> 02:04:22,996
MARISHA: Jesus F. Christ.

2495
02:04:22,996 --> 02:04:24,911
MATT: A bunch of barrels just (rolling sound) in
your direction.

2496
02:04:24,911 --> 02:04:30,629
MARISHA: Oh, that's not too bad. Just straight dex
saving throw. Plus five.

2497
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:31,739
LIAM: Natural 20.

2498
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:33,417
MARISHA: What did I roll? 16.

2499
02:04:33,417 --> 02:04:35,183
MATT: Okay, yeah, you both manage to just sidestep
out of the way

2500
02:04:35,183 --> 02:04:38,146
as they tumble past and splash into
the water below.

2501
02:04:38,146 --> 02:04:39,363
TALIESIN: Get out of here, you two!

2502
02:04:39,363 --> 02:04:41,377
MATT: You're starting to lose your footing a
little bit. You probably have one more round

2503
02:04:41,377 --> 02:04:43,343
before you just start sliding off the edge.

2504
02:04:43,343 --> 02:04:44,551
LIAM: Let's go, man!

2505
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,002
MARISHA: Quick, quick, quick!

2506
02:04:46,002 --> 02:04:47,527
TALIESIN: I'm fine. Vex is here, you two leave.

2507
02:04:47,527 --> 02:04:49,479
MATT: Percival. Perception check, as the water
separates in the room.

2508
02:04:49,479 --> 02:04:54,594
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's what I'm hoping for.

2509
02:04:54,594 --> 02:04:56,219
MARISHA: Aw, you rolled a 19!

2510
02:04:56,219 --> 02:04:57,554
TALIESIN: That's 26.

2511
02:04:57,554 --> 02:05:02,306
MATT: Okay. As you push down into the chamber with
the walls of the water to the sides-- as you look

2512
02:05:02,306 --> 02:05:07,455
down, and most of the furniture that was thrust up
out of this area is cleared out. You do see two

2513
02:05:07,455 --> 02:05:10,251
cages in the far back, one of which is empty.

2514
02:05:10,251 --> 02:05:13,286
The other one does seem to have some sort of
humanoid inside.

2515
02:05:13,286 --> 02:05:14,334
TALIESIN: I'm going for it.

2516
02:05:14,334 --> 02:05:15,209
MARISHA: Come on.

2517
02:05:15,209 --> 02:05:18,361
MATT: Okay. You rush up to the cage, and you look
inside and you can already see what looks to be a

2518
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:22,365
slumped-over humanoid. You see no features,
and there's no light down here, and your human

2519
02:05:22,365 --> 02:05:26,441
eyes don't make out a lot of detail. The fact that
you rolled so high-- it's only the little bit of

2520
02:05:26,441 --> 02:05:28,216
light comes down here that's reflecting around.

2521
02:05:28,216 --> 02:05:28,808
LAURA: Shit.

2522
02:05:28,808 --> 02:05:32,344
TALIESIN: I've already got the keys in my hand and
I'm just going to start going for it.

2523
02:05:32,344 --> 02:05:36,547
MATT: First key, nothing. Second key, nothing.
Third key, noth-- (creaking sounds)

2524
02:05:36,547 --> 02:05:37,911
SAM: Cut the red wire!

2525
02:05:37,911 --> 02:05:41,608
MATT: Water begins to pour in from another side,
and the ship itself is pulling back. I want you

2526
02:05:41,608 --> 02:05:43,215
to go ahead and make an intelligence check.

2527
02:05:43,215 --> 02:05:45,540
MARISHA: Come on, Percy. Come on.

2528
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:54,582
TALIESIN: I'm going to choose to use a Resolve.
That's a save, isn't it?

2529
02:05:54,582 --> 02:05:56,292
MATT: That's for a saving throw.

2530
02:05:56,292 --> 02:05:57,173
TALIESIN: God damn it.

2531
02:05:57,173 --> 02:05:58,155
TRAVIS: Why didn't you roll the snitch?

2532
02:05:58,155 --> 02:05:59,028
MATT: What did you roll?

2533
02:05:59,028 --> 02:05:59,833
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

2534
02:05:59,833 --> 02:06:05,916
MATT: A natural one. You start getting the keys
in, and there's probably a good 15 or 16 or so

2535
02:06:05,916 --> 02:06:10,235
keys on here, and you get through about six of
them before the ship itself has gone into a fall,

2536
02:06:10,235 --> 02:06:12,036
and the cages begin to slide--

2537
02:06:12,036 --> 02:06:16,897
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm rolling. There's someone in
there, but I can't get it! And I'm going to

2538
02:06:16,897 --> 02:06:22,602
spider-climb on the upside, on the wrong side of
the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out.

2539
02:06:22,602 --> 02:06:24,607
LIAM: Was he under water, or was the water--

2540
02:06:24,607 --> 02:06:26,361
MATT: The water is being parted by Keyleth,
currently.

2541
02:06:26,361 --> 02:06:27,311
LAURA: Okay.

2542
02:06:27,311 --> 02:06:30,550
MATT: The cage is beginning to slide now,
towards the back of the ship.

2543
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:34,082
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do. And I'm running
out, I don't know what else to do.

2544
02:06:34,082 --> 02:06:35,121
MATT: Okay, so.

2545
02:06:35,121 --> 02:06:36,029
MARISHA: What?

2546
02:06:36,029 --> 02:06:37,569
TALIESIN: There's someone in a cage. I don't know
what to do!

2547
02:06:37,569 --> 02:06:38,979
LIAM: I'll fly at that.

2548
02:06:38,979 --> 02:06:39,976
MATT: Okay.

2549
02:06:39,976 --> 02:06:45,968
MARISHA: Are you going? I'm gonna try whatever
last bit of Control Water I have to try and part

2550
02:06:45,968 --> 02:06:50,431
and calm the waters where Vax is going, and I say,
go Vax, go!

2551
02:06:50,431 --> 02:06:51,919
MATT: Okay, so you just fly in?

2552
02:06:51,919 --> 02:06:54,284
LIAM: If there's a cage, I'll go to it.

2553
02:06:54,284 --> 02:06:58,630
MATT: As you rush down inside, you watch as these
two large, heavy cages are tumbling in your

2554
02:06:58,630 --> 02:07:03,574
direction. An empty one slams just past you,
and the other one slams into that, itself turning

2555
02:07:03,574 --> 02:07:06,380
up a bit, and something inside slumps to the side
of the bars.

2556
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:07,953
MARISHA: I'm trying to calm the water as much as I
can.

2557
02:07:07,953 --> 02:07:09,644
LIAM: Can I even see the lock or where the keys
were?

2558
02:07:09,644 --> 02:07:10,609
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2559
02:07:10,609 --> 02:07:11,588
LIAM: All right.

2560
02:07:11,588 --> 02:07:12,713
MATT: The keys you do not have. Percy has--

2561
02:07:12,713 --> 02:07:15,163
TALIESIN: I have the keys, but none of them were
working.

2562
02:07:15,163 --> 02:07:16,651
LIAM: That's a 21.

2563
02:07:16,651 --> 02:07:21,260
MATT: 21. You manage to, as you leap up using your
wings in little bursts-- this is a small,

2564
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:26,449
enclosed space, you can't use too much of the air
to fly. In what little bit of parting of the

2565
02:07:26,449 --> 02:07:29,974
water's being done, you catch up and climb onto
the top, and you can see the cage has turned on

2566
02:07:29,974 --> 02:07:33,558
its side, and the doorway is on the top.
So you can see the actual lock.

2567
02:07:33,558 --> 02:07:37,179
LIAM: All right. While I'm hasted, do I have an
action left to get up there and pick it?

2568
02:07:37,179 --> 02:07:38,499
MATT: I'd say yeah.

2569
02:07:38,499 --> 02:07:39,510
LIAM: Yeah? Okay.

2570
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:41,532
LAURA and MARISHA: Go, go, go!

2571
02:07:41,532 --> 02:07:43,303
LIAM: 32.

2572
02:07:43,303 --> 02:07:47,381
MATT: You reach out and pull out your picks,
and as you look up-- Keyleth, at this point

2573
02:07:47,381 --> 02:07:53,336
you're parting the water, but the ship is now
sinking, and you are-- you're sliding off.

2574
02:07:53,336 --> 02:07:55,519
TALIESIN: I grab. Can I make a jump to grab?

2575
02:07:55,519 --> 02:07:57,505
MATT: You can. Go ahead and make a dexterity
check.

2576
02:07:57,505 --> 02:08:05,247
MARISHA: And I'm just holding concentration,
hoping someone catches me.

2577
02:08:05,247 --> 02:08:07,534
TALIESIN: My dexterity-- save or check?

2578
02:08:07,534 --> 02:08:09,045
MATT: Either.

2579
02:08:09,045 --> 02:08:11,325
TALIESIN: They're both the same. It doesn't
matter.

2580
02:08:11,325 --> 02:08:13,079
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

2581
02:08:13,079 --> 02:08:14,643
TALIESIN: 22.

2582
02:08:14,643 --> 02:08:20,305
MATT: Just catch Keyleth as she's about to slide
off the edge, and you hold her there. Now,

2583
02:08:20,305 --> 02:08:22,663
I will not require a concentration check from
you, however,

2584
02:08:22,663 --> 02:08:24,723
you're about to both go under water.

2585
02:08:24,723 --> 02:08:26,173
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2586
02:08:26,173 --> 02:08:29,644
MATT: You're holding her at the edge of the ship.
You get the door open. It slams over on the side.

2587
02:08:29,644 --> 02:08:32,904
And looking down inside, you can see what appears
to be

2588
02:08:32,904 --> 02:08:37,124
a slumped-over, soggy mess of a person.
Unconscious.

2589
02:08:37,124 --> 02:08:38,864
LIAM: Okay, can I keep going here, or--

2590
02:08:38,864 --> 02:08:42,646
MATT: Yeah. Grab them, pull them up, fireman's
carry--

2591
02:08:42,646 --> 02:08:47,099
LIAM: And then just try to slowly, messily float
him up and out of here.

2592
02:08:47,099 --> 02:08:48,761
LAURA: I want to go help if I can.

2593
02:08:48,761 --> 02:08:49,480
LIAM: Yeah.

2594
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,298
MATT: Yeah, there's not much room for flight,
it's more like--

2595
02:08:51,298 --> 02:08:52,333
LIAM: All right, so pull.

2596
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:57,900
MATT: -- leaping through, as you make your way
there. You just get up onto the edge as the water

2597
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:01,222
goes past both Percy and Keyleth. You guys,

2598
02:09:01,222 --> 02:09:03,507
your faces just (splash) beneath the ocean
water.

2599
02:09:03,507 --> 02:09:04,537
MARISHA: Yeah!

2600
02:09:04,537 --> 02:09:06,579
LIAM: I shout out, Twinnie!

2601
02:09:06,579 --> 02:09:08,578
LAURA: I help, I help, I help.

2602
02:09:08,578 --> 02:09:13,285
MATT: You rush down from the broom. He goes and
flings the person over your lap, and you take up

2603
02:09:13,285 --> 02:09:18,106
on the rest of the ship as the boat now is
completely submerged. You watch the tip of it just

2604
02:09:18,106 --> 02:09:21,594
(splash) beneath the water. 
Bubbling the water up around as--

2605
02:09:21,594 --> 02:09:28,420
MARISHA: I drop Control Water, switch back to my
Alter Self, grab Percy, head back to the boat.

2606
02:09:28,484 --> 02:09:29,282
MATT: Okay.

2607
02:09:29,282 --> 02:09:36,360
SAM: While this is going on, I'm asking Captain
Adella's crew for towels. Could I get a towel?

2608
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:38,923
Or some sort of-- I'm really wet, here.

2609
02:09:38,923 --> 02:09:42,938
MATT: They're all on the edge of the ship,
watching this happen. With one in the crow's

2610
02:09:42,938 --> 02:09:45,603
nest, keeping an eye out. And they're not paying
any attention to you.

2611
02:09:45,603 --> 02:09:50,364
SAM: I'm just worried that this will rust if I
don't get it dry soon, so if I could get some

2612
02:09:50,364 --> 02:09:54,938
towels, or maybe someone to fan it off, that would
be great. Thank you.

2613
02:09:54,938 --> 02:10:00,100
MATT: All right. No response, but you are eager to
repeat your question. As you make your way over,

2614
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:06,568
Keyleth, you pull Percival-- because both of you
guys sink quite a bit below with the ship.

2615
02:10:06,568 --> 02:10:12,001
As soon as it goes under, it goes under fast,
and as soon as you glance up to watch that Vax

2616
02:10:12,001 --> 02:10:16,279
makes his way out, and you can just see over the
surface, you relieve that to start swimming up,

2617
02:10:16,279 --> 02:10:20,901
and both the two of you-- you release your boots,
and begin to make your way to the surface.

2618
02:10:20,901 --> 02:10:25,448
It takes a moment, and you just get to the cusp
of what you can hold your breath, before you both

2619
02:10:25,448 --> 02:10:30,563
break the surface. Percy takes a deep breath,
and you guys eventually swim your way over

2620
02:10:30,563 --> 02:10:35,501
towards the edge of the boat. The fog, by the way,
has begun to dissipate now, and has been slowly

2621
02:10:35,501 --> 02:10:38,077
doing so since your removal of the orb from the
edge.

2622
02:10:38,077 --> 02:10:39,988
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2623
02:10:39,988 --> 02:10:44,921
MATT: As you guys all manage to make your way back
onto the surface of the ship, waterlogged and

2624
02:10:44,921 --> 02:10:47,476
tired, we're going to take a break for the
restroom.

2625
02:10:47,476 --> 02:10:49,613
TRAVIS: Nice! A fight at sea!

2626
02:10:49,613 --> 02:10:51,061
MARISHA: A fight at sea!

2627
02:10:51,061 --> 02:10:52,992
TRAVIS: We made it off the Titanic!

2628
02:10:52,992 --> 02:10:54,427
TALIESIN: I fell off a boat.

2629
02:10:54,427 --> 02:10:56,389
LIAM: This is stupid, Rose! This is stupid!

2630
02:10:56,389 --> 02:10:58,155
TRAVIS: This is stupid, why would you do that?

2631
02:10:58,155 --> 02:10:59,158
MARISHA: Like Battleship, but better.

2632
02:10:59,209 --> 02:11:03,737
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes.
We do have a Wyrmwood giveaway for you guys in

2633

2635

2636
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:20,007
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2637
02:11:20,007 --> 02:27:03,041
[break]

2638
02:27:03,041 --> 02:27:07,886
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role! First off, thank you again to our

Wyrmwood, the winner is Terrythesortofgamer.

2644
02:27:28,627 --> 02:27:30,130
(all cheer)

2645
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:34,300
MATT: Congratulations, Terry, we're gonna go ahead
and get this signed and shipped out to you ASAP.

2646
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:37,842
Thank you all for entering, we'll have more 
giveaways in future episodes as well as Talks

2647
02:27:37,842 --> 02:27:43,717
Machina on Tuesday with Brian Foster.
Anyway, let's bring it back in.

2648
02:27:43,717 --> 02:27:45,086
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2649
02:27:45,086 --> 02:27:51,473
MATT: So, having returned to the ship, the fog
lifted, and the path before you now clear,

2650
02:27:51,473 --> 02:27:56,860
the rest of the open, cloudless sky before you,
you continued ahead in the southwestern

2651
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:02,324
direction towards the Islands of Anamn,
which is where Vesrah exists--

2652
02:28:02,324 --> 02:28:05,017
LAURA: But I wanted to see the prisoner--

2653
02:28:05,017 --> 02:28:06,317
MARISHA: Yeah, the prisoner.

2654
02:28:06,317 --> 02:28:08,698
LAURA: -- are they okay? I mean,
did I check them out while I was--

2655
02:28:08,816 --> 02:28:09,655
MARISHA: Yeah.

2656
02:28:09,655 --> 02:28:10,980
MATT: We're getting to that right now.

2657
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:11,785
MARISHA: Let's bring 'em back.

2658
02:28:11,785 --> 02:28:12,435
LAURA: Okay.

2659
02:28:12,435 --> 02:28:13,111
TRAVIS: Fuckin', just cool your jets.

2660
02:28:13,111 --> 02:28:14,081
MARISHA: We wanna talk to him.

2661
02:28:14,081 --> 02:28:15,116
LAURA: Well, I mean, I had him on my lap
as I was flying back.

2662
02:28:15,116 --> 02:28:16,354
I wanted to make sure they were okay.

2663
02:28:16,354 --> 02:28:17,983
MATT: Right, so you come back to the--
as you bring the prisoner down,

2664
02:28:17,983 --> 02:28:23,939
you lay him down-- and it is a man, early, mid-
thirties-ish, maybe

2665
02:28:23,939 --> 02:28:27,590
looks grizzled, kind of a half beard growing in--

2666
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:28,518
TRAVIS: Kill him.

2667
02:28:28,518 --> 02:28:32,582
MATT: -- he is drowned at the moment.

2668
02:28:32,582 --> 02:28:33,300
LAURA: (gasps)

2669
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:34,181
SAM: Oh, he's dead?

2670
02:28:34,181 --> 02:28:38,951
MATT: He's not breathing, he is waterlogged, 
and even at a quick glance,

2671
02:28:38,951 --> 02:28:42,385
you can see he has scars all over his
body--

2672
02:28:42,385 --> 02:28:43,085
LAURA: Oh no.

2673
02:28:43,085 --> 02:28:44,294
MATT: -- his clothes are tattered--

2674
02:28:44,294 --> 02:28:48,251
MARISHA: Do I have any residual Control Water 
left? Yeah?

2675
02:28:48,251 --> 02:28:52,457
MATT: I'd say yeah, you're still concentrating--

2676
02:28:52,457 --> 02:28:54,211
LAURA: I roll him on his side.

2677
02:28:54,211 --> 02:28:59,041
MARISHA: Can I see if I can pull any water out of
his lungs?

2678
02:28:59,041 --> 02:29:02,201
MATT: You know what? Make a wisdom check.

2679
02:29:02,201 --> 02:29:03,964
LIAM: Out come the lungs.

2680
02:29:03,964 --> 02:29:07,444
LAURA: (vomit noise) And he's dead. Dead dead.

2681
02:29:07,444 --> 02:29:10,476
MARISHA: That's good! Just straight wisdom?

2682
02:29:10,476 --> 02:29:11,616
LIAM: He's inside out.

2683
02:29:11,616 --> 02:29:12,488
MATT: Yeah.

2684
02:29:12,488 --> 02:29:13,536
MARISHA: Straight wisdom?

2685
02:29:13,536 --> 02:29:14,522
TRAVIS: What is dead may never die!

2686
02:29:14,522 --> 02:29:15,328
MARISHA: 21.

2687
02:29:15,328 --> 02:29:16,350
LAURA: Oh no, you keep scooching back.

2688
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:17,288
MATT: 21!

2689
02:29:17,288 --> 02:29:19,024
MARISHA: Just straight wisdom?

2690
02:29:19,024 --> 02:29:19,751
LIAM: What the heck, Laura.

2691
02:29:19,751 --> 02:29:20,370
MATT: Yeah.

2692
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:21,030
MARISHA: Yeah.

2693
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:22,885
MATT: So you get down on the low, and you reach
out and grab the shoulder, and using the last

2694
02:29:22,885 --> 02:29:30,125
moments of your Control Water spell, you focus
and begin to just siphon the water out of the lungs,

2695
02:29:30,125 --> 02:29:36,130
and immediately the body kind of convulses,
the throat opens up from the outside, and you can

2696
02:29:36,130 --> 02:29:42,280
see the water just project outward as the chest
pushes inward, expelling the rest of the liquid

2697
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:48,559
from the lungs. Immediately, (coughs).

2698
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:50,237
MARISHA: Vax. Help.

2699
02:29:50,237 --> 02:29:51,067
LIAM: Yeah.

2700
02:29:51,067 --> 02:29:53,165
LAURA: Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

2701
02:29:53,165 --> 02:29:55,729
LIAM: I do pat, pat, pat, except I cast Lay on 
Hands when I do it.

2702
02:29:55,729 --> 02:30:00,440
LAURA: Yeah, well, I cast Cure Wounds while that
happens, so go fuck yourself.

2703
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:04,562
LIAM: Seems oddly competitive at this moment,
where we're saving a man's life, but all right.

2704
02:30:04,562 --> 02:30:09,598
MATT: What last murmurs of this man's life
that remained as he began to fade to the drowning,

2705
02:30:09,691 --> 02:30:18,152
you both manage to just bring him back from the
cusp of death, and coughing profusely over the

2706
02:30:18,152 --> 02:30:24,453
next 30 or so seconds, turning onto his stomach
and gathering himself, taking breaths, spitting

2707
02:30:24,453 --> 02:30:28,509
out whatever seawater still remains in his lungs,
he looks back up at you all, and you can see he

2708
02:30:28,509 --> 02:30:36,355
has a ragged, mouse-brown hair on top, and it's
shorter on the sides around the ear, rather large

2709
02:30:36,355 --> 02:30:45,007
ears, kind of square jaw but very scrawny,
and once again from the tattered clothes and

2710
02:30:45,007 --> 02:30:48,194
scars all over his body, some fresh, some old,

2711
02:30:48,194 --> 02:30:53,844
looks like he's undergone a rough recent weeks--

2712
02:30:53,844 --> 02:30:56,480
LAURA: I feel like we're finding Percy all over 
again.

2713
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:58,472
MARISHA: No shit.

2714
02:30:58,472 --> 02:31:07,139
MATT: Kinda looks up at everyone. 
"Wh-- Where am I?"

2715
02:31:07,139 --> 02:31:09,089
LAURA: On a boat!

2716
02:31:09,089 --> 02:31:11,146
TALIESIN: Different boat. Ship.

2717
02:31:11,146 --> 02:31:12,326
LIAM: Our boat.

2718
02:31:12,326 --> 02:31:13,812
MATT: "What do you want?"

2719
02:31:13,812 --> 02:31:16,154
LAURA: How long have you been in that cell?

2720
02:31:16,154 --> 02:31:18,466
MATT: "Who are you?"

2721
02:31:18,466 --> 02:31:19,674
MARISHA: Sorry.

2722
02:31:19,674 --> 02:31:20,799
LAURA: We're your saviors.

2723
02:31:20,799 --> 02:31:23,746
MATT: He leans back, falls onto his palms a bit,
and is just kinda laying back,

2724
02:31:23,746 --> 02:31:27,912
too exhausted to move away, but trying to just
move back a bit.

2725
02:31:27,912 --> 02:31:31,952
LAURA: Can I insight check him and make sure? 
I just don't trust anyone.

2726
02:31:31,952 --> 02:31:36,142
MATT: Sure. Insight check.

2727
02:31:36,142 --> 02:31:39,341
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20. Wow wow wow.

2728
02:31:39,341 --> 02:31:41,444
SAM: He's a demon.

2729
02:31:41,444 --> 02:31:42,300
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2730
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:43,311
LIAM: It's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's 
Hotis!

2731
02:31:43,311 --> 02:31:44,538
LAURA: Oh it is, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!

2732
02:31:44,538 --> 02:31:46,291
MARISHA: Oh, I don't wanna fight Hotis on the 
ocean.

2733
02:31:46,291 --> 02:31:47,596
SAM: Guys, feel free to keep--

2734
02:31:47,596 --> 02:31:49,864
MARISHA: What you got? What do you got, Grog?

2735
02:31:49,864 --> 02:31:51,237
MATT: Shove off, Travis.

2736
02:31:51,237 --> 02:31:57,767
SAM: Keep tweeting those pick-up lines to 
@TorBooks. They like 'em. I do, anyway.

2737
02:31:57,767 --> 02:32:01,820
LIAM: Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does
anybody want anything?

2738
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:04,789
MATT: Curse you, Travis.

2739
02:32:04,789 --> 02:32:07,884
SAM: Grande fantasy novel?

2740
02:32:07,884 --> 02:32:08,846
LAURA: Don't worry.

2741
02:32:08,846 --> 02:32:11,228
MATT: (coughs)

2742
02:32:11,228 --> 02:32:14,517
LAURA: Your captors have been defeated.

2743
02:32:14,517 --> 02:32:16,111
MATT: "Well that's good, eh?"

2744
02:32:16,111 --> 02:32:20,079
LAURA: You're safe. What's your name?

2745
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:24,337
MATT: He leans forward, sits up and looks at you.
He seems to soften a little bit, though he's

2746
02:32:24,337 --> 02:32:38,949
still guarded. "Thenton Groose. First Mate of the 
ship Tempest Fang. Yeah."

2747
02:32:38,949 --> 02:32:40,358
LAURA: Tempest Fang?

2748
02:32:40,358 --> 02:32:49,594
MATT: "Tempest Fang. Yeah. It was taken by a bunch
of bastards, kept me in that cage for a few weeks."

2749
02:32:49,594 --> 02:32:50,912
LAURA: Weeks.

2750
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:55,263
MARISHA: Tempest Fang-- where do you hail from?

2751
02:32:55,263 --> 02:33:00,072
MATT: "Who wants to know?"

2752
02:33:00,072 --> 02:33:04,456
MARISHA: Keyleth, of the Air Ashari.

2753
02:33:04,456 --> 02:33:06,999
MATT: "From around."

2754
02:33:06,999 --> 02:33:10,394
MARISHA: From around?

2755
02:33:10,394 --> 02:33:14,337
MATT: "I'm a businessman of the seas."

2756
02:33:14,337 --> 02:33:17,833
MARISHA: Not the sailor type, then?

2757
02:33:17,833 --> 02:33:20,668
MATT: "Sail a bit."

2758
02:33:20,668 --> 02:33:24,261
MARISHA: What were you doing on the Ozmit
Sea?

2759
02:33:24,261 --> 02:33:32,468
MATT: "Making a shipment across to Emon from
Issylra, and this group of thugs decided to go

2760
02:33:32,468 --> 02:33:38,711
"ahead and ransack us from the side. Took our ship
down and most of the crew. Kept a few of us alive

2761
02:33:38,711 --> 02:33:44,663
"underneath. Seems like I was the one who lasted
the longest."

2762
02:33:44,663 --> 02:33:46,849
MARISHA: From Emon to where?

2763
02:33:46,849 --> 02:33:48,241
LIAM: From Issylra to Emon.

2764
02:33:48,241 --> 02:33:49,271
MATT: "From Issylra."

2765
02:33:49,271 --> 02:33:50,453
MARISHA: Oh, from Issylra.

2766
02:33:50,453 --> 02:33:52,529
LIAM: What was your cargo?

2767
02:33:52,529 --> 02:33:57,913
MATT: He looks at you for a second, reads you up 
and down as you step into the conversation.

2768
02:33:57,913 --> 02:34:01,402
"General goods. Few fancy textiles--"

2769
02:34:01,402 --> 02:34:03,171
LIAM: Insight check.

2770
02:34:03,171 --> 02:34:04,220
MATT: "Some silks, some furs."

2771
02:34:04,220 --> 02:34:04,905
TALIESIN: Insight.

2772
02:34:04,905 --> 02:34:05,798
MATT: Insight check.

2773
02:34:05,798 --> 02:34:10,354
LIAM: 18.

2774
02:34:10,354 --> 02:34:15,486
TALIESIN: 19.

2775
02:34:15,486 --> 02:34:17,044
LAURA: Ooh.

2776
02:34:17,044 --> 02:34:17,880
SAM: Oh boy!

2777
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,859
LAURA: Again, again!

2778
02:34:18,859 --> 02:34:19,992
SAM: Lots of whispers, guys.

2779
02:34:19,992 --> 02:34:20,928
LIAM: Just come sit with us.

2780
02:34:20,928 --> 02:34:22,144
MARISHA: All the whispers.

2781
02:34:22,144 --> 02:34:23,326
LAURA: Oh, but do you just wanna hang
out over here?

2782
02:34:23,326 --> 02:34:24,466
'Cause Travis is just gonna fuck with 
your shit again.

2783
02:34:24,466 --> 02:34:27,085
SAM: Hey, in the future-- Travis, what do you 
think about this-- don't shake your butt.

2784
02:34:27,085 --> 02:34:27,534
MARISHA: Yeah!

2785
02:34:27,534 --> 02:34:28,416
SAM: That's disgusting.

2786
02:34:28,416 --> 02:34:30,398
MARISHA: Get it, Levi's, yeah.

2787
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:37,564
SAM: What if we-- here's my pitch. What if we
have two tin cans and a string that just goes to

2788
02:34:37,564 --> 02:34:39,737
Matt, and we can do like one of these
things.

2789
02:34:39,737 --> 02:34:41,397
MATT: That's a great idea.

2790
02:34:41,397 --> 02:34:43,921
SAM: Ah! Ah!

2791
02:34:43,921 --> 02:34:49,858
LAURA: That would be so cool.

2792
02:34:49,858 --> 02:34:56,784
MATT: "Yeah, I'm just-- I'm glad you came along."

2793
02:34:56,784 --> 02:35:00,421
TALIESIN: Tell me, friend. Why did they keep you
alive?

2794
02:35:00,421 --> 02:35:01,742
MATT: "That's a good question."

2795
02:35:01,742 --> 02:35:04,848
TALIESIN: It is.

2796
02:35:04,848 --> 02:35:06,417
MATT: "I don't fucking know."

2797
02:35:06,417 --> 02:35:08,805
TALIESIN: What did they ask you?

2798
02:35:08,805 --> 02:35:10,678
LAURA: Can we get some food?

2799
02:35:10,678 --> 02:35:11,988
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

2800
02:35:11,988 --> 02:35:13,337
MATT: Immediately his eyes widen--

2801
02:35:13,337 --> 02:35:16,659
LAURA: I was talking back to Captain Adella 
or one of the crewmates. Not you, Grog.

2802
02:35:16,659 --> 02:35:22,450
MATT: As soon as you do that, Captain Adella 
goes, "Ah, I don't get food. You get food!"

2803
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:27,102
And one of the other crewmates, "Oh, oh right."

2804
02:35:27,102 --> 02:35:29,089
And he immediately jumps down below the deck.

2805
02:35:29,089 --> 02:35:33,486
SAM: I'm gluten-free!

2806
02:35:33,486 --> 02:35:38,502
LIAM: Well, we saved your life, how else can we
help you, friend?

2807
02:35:38,502 --> 02:35:42,207
MATT: "Oh, just drop me off at the nearest port 
you get to, please."

2808
02:35:42,207 --> 02:35:43,591
TALIESIN: That's going to be a while.

2809
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:44,951
MARISHA: Yes.

2810
02:35:44,951 --> 02:35:46,462
MATT: "That's fine. That's fine."

2811
02:35:46,462 --> 02:35:52,449
MARISHA: Have you sailed frequently before? 
What was your exact duty on this ship?

2812
02:35:52,449 --> 02:35:53,840
LAURA: First Mate?

2813
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:57,850
MARISHA: Oh. Right. He already said that. So, 
you sail a lot.

2814
02:35:57,850 --> 02:35:59,497
MATT: "A fair bit, yeah."

2815
02:35:59,497 --> 02:36:00,197
MARISHA: Yeah.

2816
02:36:00,197 --> 02:36:01,743
TALIESIN: Any tattoos on him?

2817
02:36:01,743 --> 02:36:04,044
MATT: Yeah, actually, a handful visibly.

2818
02:36:04,044 --> 02:36:07,667
TALIESIN: Any I'd recognize? I was on a boat for
quite a while, as well.

2819
02:36:07,667 --> 02:36:08,330
MATT: Right.

2820
02:36:08,330 --> 02:36:09,460
TALIESIN: It was a long time ago.

2821
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:10,655
MATT: Make a history check.

2822
02:36:10,655 --> 02:36:17,413
TALIESIN: All right. Let's say 18.

2823
02:36:17,413 --> 02:36:23,837
MATT: 18? Okay. None of the
symbols you recognize, necessarily, however,

2824
02:36:23,837 --> 02:36:34,222
the arrangement of them-- the placement of them
and the general design are not used as-- there's

2825
02:36:34,222 --> 02:36:36,857
tattoos you could see they're decoration,
there're tattoos you could see that are meant

2826
02:36:36,857 --> 02:36:39,870
as-- they mean something to the person. These
tattoos

2827
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:43,970
and their placement seems intentionally to 
intimidate.

2828
02:36:43,970 --> 02:36:45,841
TALIESIN: Huh. Okay.

2829
02:36:45,841 --> 02:36:47,223
LAURA: Was he a pirate?

2830
02:36:47,223 --> 02:36:54,223
TRAVIS: Mr. Theton Groove, is anyone
looking for you right now?

2831
02:36:54,223 --> 02:36:57,863
MATT: "I don't think
so, my crew went down with the ship."

2832
02:36:57,863 --> 02:37:00,387
TALIESIN: What was your captain's name?

2833
02:37:00,387 --> 02:37:03,345
MATT: He kind of looks over at you, 
"Wha-- what-- why--"

2834
02:37:03,345 --> 02:37:06,088
TALIESIN: I was just curious how quickly
you'd answer it. It's fine. Carry on. You will be

2835
02:37:06,088 --> 02:37:10,389
getting food, don't worry, this is not us being
threatening, we're just... it's odd finding a man

2836
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:14,030
in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled
with awful people.

2837
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:17,097
That alone makes us like you, but you are 
a bit weird.

2838
02:37:17,097 --> 02:37:19,855
MARISHA: That's true. That's all true.

2839
02:37:19,855 --> 02:37:20,677
TALIESIN: It is true.

2840
02:37:20,677 --> 02:37:22,101
MARISHA: Yeah.

2841
02:37:22,101 --> 02:37:24,527
LAURA: Forgive us, we have to be a bit wary.

2842
02:37:24,527 --> 02:37:25,443
MARISHA: We've seen a lot.

2843
02:37:25,443 --> 02:37:27,271
MATT: "No, no, that's--"

2844
02:37:27,271 --> 02:37:29,718
TALIESIN: We don't mind if you're disreputable, 
we just would like

2845
02:37:29,718 --> 02:37:31,983
to know if you're our kind of disreputable.

2846
02:37:31,983 --> 02:37:34,762
SAM: If I may, new companions.

2847
02:37:34,836 --> 02:37:36,939
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2848
02:37:36,939 --> 02:37:38,826
SAM: When my father would have--

2849
02:37:38,826 --> 02:37:40,101
TALIESIN: Oh boy, okay.

2850
02:37:40,101 --> 02:37:44,798
SAM: -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed
to interrogate, he had an employee named The Dog

2851
02:37:44,798 --> 02:37:50,524
who was a large man, who would come and just
squeeze them until they talked. Why don't

2852
02:37:50,524 --> 02:37:54,815
we just do that here? It seems like it would be 
much quicker than talking in circles like this.

2853
02:37:54,815 --> 02:37:56,486
MARISHA: Do you have The Dog with you?

2854
02:37:56,486 --> 02:37:58,066
SAM: Well, we have this guy, who's pretty big--

2855
02:37:58,066 --> 02:37:58,818
MARISHA: Oh.

2856
02:37:58,818 --> 02:37:59,800
SAM: -- and I bet he could squeeze--

2857
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:02,476
TRAVIS: I mean, I second that method,
but I'm just seeing if anybody else--

2858
02:38:02,476 --> 02:38:04,252
TALIESIN: I feel like that's deeply premature.

2859
02:38:04,252 --> 02:38:07,101
TRAVIS: It's deeply immature. I would never 
do something like that.

2860
02:38:07,101 --> 02:38:07,912
TALIESIN: Immature indeed.

2861
02:38:07,912 --> 02:38:09,007
SAM: Well, all right.

2862
02:38:09,007 --> 02:38:13,421
LAURA: Plus he's so frail right now, I'm afraid
Grog would just break him in half.

2863
02:38:13,421 --> 02:38:16,232
TRAVIS: Probably.

2864
02:38:16,232 --> 02:38:21,225
MATT: He is noticeably looking nervously back and
forth between Taryon and Grog, and--

2865
02:38:21,225 --> 02:38:22,606
TRAVIS: I mean, after all, we saved your life, 
right?

2866
02:38:22,606 --> 02:38:25,662
You wouldn't be
(yells) hiding nothing, would you?

2867
02:38:25,662 --> 02:38:27,019
MATT: "No?"

2868
02:38:27,019 --> 02:38:28,149
TRAVIS: See?

2869
02:38:28,149 --> 02:38:30,348
MARISHA: Honestly, this is how we treat 
people we like.

2870
02:38:30,348 --> 02:38:32,566
TALIESIN: God, that's also true.

2871
02:38:32,566 --> 02:38:33,393
MARISHA: Yeah.

2872
02:38:33,393 --> 02:38:34,885
MATT: "Does anyone have any water?"

2873
02:38:34,885 --> 02:38:35,395
LAURA: Yes.

2874
02:38:35,395 --> 02:38:36,324
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

2875
02:38:36,324 --> 02:38:38,207
MATT: "Fresh water? Oh, thank you."

2876
02:38:38,207 --> 02:38:41,107
And he pulls it out and just starts drinking 
thirstily from it.

2877
02:38:41,107 --> 02:38:48,968
MARISHA: All right. So we've cleared a
few things, right? You seem untrustworthy,

2878
02:38:48,968 --> 02:38:54,987
and broken, so therefore we like you. What else
can we learn about you?

2879
02:38:54,987 --> 02:38:59,747
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about. 
Look, I have business contacts,

2880
02:38:59,747 --> 02:39:04,541
"I can get you paid, just get me safe somewhere."

2881
02:39:04,541 --> 02:39:06,860
TALIESIN: What sort of business contacts?

2882
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:12,352
MATT: "The sort that I do business with, I told
you. We deal in trade across the Ozmit."

2883
02:39:12,352 --> 02:39:15,871
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, he's shifty as fuck,
but it's no skin off my back, right?

2884
02:39:15,871 --> 02:39:17,174
TALIESIN: No, not really.

2885
02:39:17,174 --> 02:39:18,565
TRAVIS: We got any cages on this boat?

2886
02:39:18,565 --> 02:39:21,154
TALIESIN: Oh, we're not-- we don't need that yet,
where's he going to go?

2887
02:39:21,154 --> 02:39:23,157
LAURA: Do I see any, like, Clasp markings on him 
at all?

2888
02:39:23,157 --> 02:39:24,642
LIAM: That question might be great, but I think
we're all right.

2889
02:39:24,642 --> 02:39:25,781
MATT: Nothing Clasp. Not really.

2890
02:39:25,781 --> 02:39:26,949
TRAVIS: Gotta sleep at some point.

2891
02:39:26,949 --> 02:39:29,681
MATT: You kinda glance over and look at the middle
of his shoulders and his shirt is

2892
02:39:29,681 --> 02:39:33,532
kind of billowing, and torn. No symbol of the Clasp.

2893
02:39:33,616 --> 02:39:40,220
LAURA: Those scars on your body. Were they from
before you were captured, or after?

2894
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:50,173
MATT: "Some-- both ways. The cages don't really
protect very well."

2895
02:39:50,173 --> 02:39:53,226
LAURA: What were they doing to you?

2896
02:39:53,226 --> 02:39:58,127
MATT: "They were just having fun, trying to get 
information about my company, and,

2897
02:39:58,127 --> 02:40:02,355
"you know. Being general pirate arseholes."

2898
02:40:02,355 --> 02:40:03,612
TRAVIS: Sounds fun.

2899
02:40:03,612 --> 02:40:06,737
MARISHA: And you're sure they were just pirates,
yeah?

2900
02:40:06,737 --> 02:40:13,195
MATT: "Well, what else are they? Not the most 
pious men I've ever met."

2901
02:40:13,195 --> 02:40:17,797
MARISHA: I don't know. I've never met a real 
pirate until just now.

2902
02:40:17,797 --> 02:40:21,310
MATT: At which point, one of the crewmen comes 
up with a small cluster of biscuits,

2903
02:40:21,310 --> 02:40:26,392
and hands them over as he greedily reaches out
like, "Oh!"

2904
02:40:26,392 --> 02:40:28,173
MARISHA: Wait, one of the crewmen?

2905
02:40:28,173 --> 02:40:29,271
TALIESIN: One of ours.

2906
02:40:29,271 --> 02:40:30,062
MARISHA: One of ours?

2907
02:40:30,062 --> 02:40:30,460
MATT: Yes.

2908
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:30,936
LAURA: Yeah.

2909
02:40:30,936 --> 02:40:31,505
LIAM: Yeah.

2910
02:40:31,505 --> 02:40:32,480
LAURA: I asked if they would bring him food.

2911
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:33,092
SAM: We asked for food.

2912
02:40:33,092 --> 02:40:33,957
MATT: Adella just sent him for food.

2913
02:40:33,957 --> 02:40:35,913
LAURA: I asked him to bring food.

2914
02:40:35,913 --> 02:40:37,954
MARISHA: Why is he acting like he's starving?

2915
02:40:37,954 --> 02:40:40,466
LAURA: Because he's been in a cage for
two weeks.

2916
02:40:40,466 --> 02:40:42,124
They didn't feed him very much.

2917
02:40:42,124 --> 02:40:43,428
MARISHA: Oh, him, not our crewmate.

2918
02:40:43,428 --> 02:40:44,168
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2919
02:40:44,168 --> 02:40:45,276
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, I--

2920
02:40:45,276 --> 02:40:46,401
MATT: The crewman brought food, and he
reached out for it.

2921
02:40:46,401 --> 02:40:46,995
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

2922
02:40:46,995 --> 02:40:47,793
MATT: That's okay.

2923
02:40:47,793 --> 02:40:49,191
MARISHA: Sorry, we were confused. Sorry.

2924
02:40:49,191 --> 02:40:50,187
MATT: That's okay.

2925
02:40:50,187 --> 02:40:52,720
LIAM: Can't you see everything around you?
It's all here.

2926
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,023
TRAVIS: He brings up a plate of biscuits and 
hungrily starts eating.

2927
02:40:55,023 --> 02:40:56,507
TALIESIN: Bangarang. Bangarang!

2928
02:40:56,507 --> 02:40:58,656
MARISHA: I brought you biscuits! (eating
sounds)

2929
02:40:58,716 --> 02:40:59,977
TALIESIN: Congratulations, Peter.

2930
02:40:59,977 --> 02:41:01,957
MATT: The crewman's a dick, by the way. Just--

2931
02:41:01,957 --> 02:41:03,398
MARISHA: Do you want these?

2932
02:41:03,398 --> 02:41:09,159
MATT: These are good biscuits, starving guy! 
To be fair, that is kinda your style.

2933
02:41:09,159 --> 02:41:11,337
LAURA: Thenton, you will forgive us 
if we don't give you free

2934
02:41:11,337 --> 02:41:13,900
rein of the ship while you're on here.

2935
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:17,765
MATT: "Oh no, that's fine. That's fine. I mean, 
lock me up, whatever you need.

2936
02:41:17,765 --> 02:41:19,500
"Just get me back to land, please."

2937
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:21,334
LAURA: We'll promise not to poke you.

2938
02:41:21,334 --> 02:41:23,010
MATT: "That's appreciated."

2939
02:41:23,010 --> 02:41:27,873
MARISHA: So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea 
frequently, yeah?

2940
02:41:27,873 --> 02:41:29,932
MATT: "Yeah."

2941
02:41:30,007 --> 02:41:36,124
MARISHA: Have you stumbled upon the island of the 
Vesrah? The Ashari people of this ocean?

2942
02:41:36,124 --> 02:41:38,407
LAURA: (laughs) Of the Ashari.

2943
02:41:38,407 --> 02:41:40,979
MARISHA: Of the Ashari (laughs).

2944
02:41:40,979 --> 02:41:44,706
MATT: He says, "If what you're referring to is
the Islands of Anamn, we generally steer clear.

2945
02:41:44,706 --> 02:41:47,254
"Too many reefs."

2946
02:41:47,254 --> 02:41:50,324
MARISHA: Of Omand? Alland?

2947
02:41:50,324 --> 02:41:52,487
MATT: Anamn. A-N-A-M-N.

2948
02:41:52,487 --> 02:41:53,218
MARISHA: Almond?

2949
02:41:53,218 --> 02:41:53,784
SAM: Aman.

2950
02:41:53,784 --> 02:41:54,400
TALIESIN: Joy.

2951
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:55,039
LAURA: A--

2952
02:41:55,039 --> 02:41:55,997
MARISHA: Almond Joy.

2953
02:41:55,997 --> 02:41:56,536
TALIESIN: Sorry.

2954
02:41:56,536 --> 02:41:57,139
MARISHA: The Island--

2955
02:41:57,139 --> 02:41:58,252
MATT: A-N-A-M-N. Anamn.

2956
02:41:58,252 --> 02:42:00,279
MARISHA: A-N-A-M-N.

2957
02:42:00,279 --> 02:42:00,890
TALIESIN: Cluster.

2958
02:42:00,890 --> 02:42:04,270
MARISHA: Anman. An-amn.

2959
02:42:04,270 --> 02:42:06,598
TRAVIS: Well, we should introduce ourselves, 
at least.

2960
02:42:06,598 --> 02:42:07,491
LAURA: Yeah.

2961
02:42:07,491 --> 02:42:14,317
TRAVIS: We are Vox Machina, a travelling
group of acrobats, and--

2962
02:42:14,317 --> 02:42:16,713
LAURA: Defeaters of dragons. No big deal.

2963
02:42:16,713 --> 02:42:17,362
TRAVIS: Yep.

2964
02:42:17,362 --> 02:42:21,642
LIAM: I do Van Damme splits, just as he 
finishes that sentence.

2965
02:42:21,642 --> 02:42:24,958
LAURA: Trinket gets up and starts
dancing around like he knows what to do,

2966
02:42:24,958 --> 02:42:26,692
when we say we're performers.

2967
02:42:26,692 --> 02:42:29,139
MARISHA: And I light up my fire hands.

2968
02:42:29,139 --> 02:42:35,513
TRAVIS: We do have two smarter members that are
not here, Scanlan and Pike, but maybe

2969
02:42:35,513 --> 02:42:37,957
you'll see them later if you stick with us long 
enough.

2970
02:42:37,957 --> 02:42:39,373
LAURA: She's a sailor, too.

2971
02:42:39,373 --> 02:42:40,388
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2972
02:42:40,388 --> 02:42:43,387
MATT: "Great."

2973
02:42:43,387 --> 02:42:48,203
SAM: Percival, am I misreading the scenario here?
Can I please just pour acid on him until he talks

2974
02:42:48,203 --> 02:42:52,740
to us? It seems like he's holding back, am I
misreading, here?

2975
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:57,343
TALIESIN: No-- well, sort of-- not really-- sort 
of. It's complicated. We don't pour acid on

2976
02:42:57,343 --> 02:43:03,091
people-- well, that's not true. No, that's a lie. 
We don't <i>just</i> pour acid on people,

2977
02:43:03,091 --> 02:43:06,155
I feel like that's reasonable to say.
We don't just pour acid--

2978
02:43:06,155 --> 02:43:07,546
LIAM: Context. Context is key.

2979
02:43:07,546 --> 02:43:09,870
TALIESIN: -- there's usually context involved.
Things are complicated.

2980
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:12,658
SAM: I am following your lead. But--

2981
02:43:12,658 --> 02:43:14,957
TALIESIN: When it is time to pour the acid,
we will

2982
02:43:14,957 --> 02:43:18,531
undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front--
not yet--

2983
02:43:18,531 --> 02:43:19,271
SAM: Okay.

2984
02:43:19,271 --> 02:43:20,430
TALIESIN: -- but you're good.

2985
02:43:20,430 --> 02:43:21,254
SAM: All right.

2986
02:43:21,254 --> 02:43:23,433
LIAM: Hey, Captain.

2987
02:43:23,433 --> 02:43:25,011
MATT: Adella's behind you guys--

2988
02:43:25,011 --> 02:43:25,592
LIAM: Yeah.

2989
02:43:25,592 --> 02:43:27,615
MATT: -- just kinda watching this whole thing with
her arms crossed.

2990
02:43:27,615 --> 02:43:29,520
One of her crewmates is currently at the helm.

2991
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:32,778
LIAM: I mean, the closest place to us right now is
our desination, most likely, right?

2992
02:43:32,778 --> 02:43:35,632
We're not gonna be able to dump this guy
before we arrive, do you think?

2993
02:43:35,632 --> 02:43:38,819
MATT: "Yeah, no, we got maybe a day and a half
travel 'til we reach the islands, so--"

2994
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:40,039
LIAM: Oy.

2995
02:43:40,039 --> 02:43:41,650
LAURA: That's all right, he can stay
on the boat.

2996
02:43:41,650 --> 02:43:43,374
TRAVIS: We got an extra room for him?

2997
02:43:43,374 --> 02:43:48,366
MATT: "We got a-- we can throw him in the
brig."

2998
02:43:48,366 --> 02:43:49,934
TALIESIN: We can make the brig comfortable.

2999
02:43:49,934 --> 02:43:53,184
LAURA: Yeah. We'll give him food. It's all right, 
right, Captain?

3000
02:43:53,184 --> 02:44:00,297
MATT: "We'll set some of-- one of our men on guard.
All right! Pick him up. Throw him in the hole."

3001
02:44:00,297 --> 02:44:03,512
Two of the crewmen come behind and pick him up,
and kind of lean over the shoulder, like,

3002
02:44:03,512 --> 02:44:11,790
"Ooh, thank you. Thank you very much, all of you."
And he gets dragged off down below into the ship.

3003
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:12,974
LIAM: Byeee.

3004
02:44:12,974 --> 02:44:13,862
MARISHA: Bye.

3005
02:44:13,862 --> 02:44:16,459
LAURA: Captain, have you heard of the Tempest 
Fang?

3006
02:44:16,459 --> 02:44:20,368
MATT: "I've heard a thing or two."

3007
02:44:20,368 --> 02:44:21,690
LAURA: Oh, really?

3008
02:44:21,690 --> 02:44:23,032
MATT: "Yeah."

3009
02:44:23,032 --> 02:44:23,904
TALIESIN: Is it a pirating vessel?

3010
02:44:23,904 --> 02:44:24,609
MATT: "Yeah."

3011
02:44:24,609 --> 02:44:27,759
(all laugh)

3012
02:44:27,759 --> 02:44:31,058
MATT: "I was gonna let him finish his
whole diatribe before we had a conversation,

3013
02:44:31,058 --> 02:44:39,028
"but he's one of 18 working companies out of the
archipelago, so--"

3014
02:44:39,028 --> 02:44:42,058
TRAVIS: I believe it's arch-i-pelago.

3015
02:44:42,058 --> 02:44:49,093
SAM: Sea diarrhea!

3016
02:44:49,093 --> 02:44:50,060
TRAVIS: Jot this down!

3017
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:56,754
(horn noises)

3018
02:44:56,754 --> 02:45:01,735
LIAM: That was sudden!

3019
02:45:01,735 --> 02:45:05,547
TALIESIN: And the tension is relieved.

3020
02:45:05,547 --> 02:45:12,360
MARISHA: So, wait. If he works for one of 18
companies of the archipelago,

3021
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:16,804
that means the archipelago has pirates--

3022
02:45:16,804 --> 02:45:18,709
LAURA: -- 17 other companies.

3023
02:45:18,709 --> 02:45:21,471
MARISHA: 17 other pirate ships?

3024
02:45:21,471 --> 02:45:26,644
MATT: Pirate companies. It's a very-- some of them
have alliances, some of them have very, very

3025
02:45:26,644 --> 02:45:33,167
deep-rooted rivalries, and yeah.

3026
02:45:33,225 --> 02:45:36,203
TALIESIN: The companies themselves have more than
one ship, if I recall.

3027
02:45:36,203 --> 02:45:38,118
MATT: Some of them do, depending on the size.

3028
02:45:38,118 --> 02:45:43,818
MARISHA: Wait, did we just sink one of the other
17 companies of the archipelago?

3029
02:45:43,818 --> 02:45:49,777
TRAVIS: Is there any extensive damage to our ship?
Are we still pretty good,

3030
02:45:49,777 --> 02:45:52,089
other than the railing getting ripped off?

3031
02:45:52,089 --> 02:45:57,679
MATT: "Looking around, my crewmen tell me we're
doing all right. So we'll do some repairs when we

3032
02:45:57,755 --> 02:46:02,130
"drop off at your location. Once you do your
business, we'll have some time to go ahead and do

3033
02:46:02,194 --> 02:46:04,263
"a once-over of our ship."

3034
02:46:04,263 --> 02:46:07,977
TALIESIN: I may have some charts that I stole from
the other ship, as well.

3035
02:46:07,977 --> 02:46:12,864
LAURA: Oh, yeah. I put them in the Bag of Colding
for the time being. Pull it out.

3036
02:46:12,864 --> 02:46:20,131
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, a lot of them are maps
of portions of the archipelago, the Hespit

3037
02:46:20,131 --> 02:46:28,861
Archipelago, some are markings of various pirate
headquarters, various places of parlay. A lot of

3038
02:46:28,861 --> 02:46:32,686
them are waterlogged and soaked and damaged,
but you can see elements that are-- a lot of them

3039
02:46:32,686 --> 02:46:37,463
are hand-drawn notes in sections. The leather tube
that you found, you pull it open, and there is a

3040
02:46:37,463 --> 02:46:45,556
very, very immaculate piece of vellum paper that
appears

3041
02:46:45,556 --> 02:46:50,408
to have a number of glyphs scrawled across it.

3042
02:46:50,408 --> 02:46:51,922
LAURA: Shit. Do we understand?

3043
02:46:51,922 --> 02:46:53,127
SAM: May I see that?

3044
02:46:53,127 --> 02:46:55,018
TALIESIN: Sure.

3045
02:46:55,018 --> 02:46:56,764
SAM: I will Identify it.

3046
02:46:56,764 --> 02:46:57,534
MATT: Okay.

3047
02:46:57,534 --> 02:46:58,376
TRAVIS: What?

3048
02:46:58,376 --> 02:47:03,673
(all cheer)

3049
02:47:03,673 --> 02:47:06,402
SAM: Much easier this way.

3050
02:47:06,402 --> 02:47:10,823
LAURA: That's great! You can Identify things? How
many times a day can you do that?

3051
02:47:10,823 --> 02:47:17,740
SAM: I think all? Scroll of Programmed Illusion.
Scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action

3052
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:24,085
to cast the sixth-level spell Programmed Illusion.
If the spell is higher-level than the caster can

3053
02:47:24,085 --> 02:47:27,514
use, they must make a spellcasting
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

3054
02:47:27,514 --> 02:47:28,912
LAURA: Are you an arcane user?

3055
02:47:28,912 --> 02:47:29,768
SAM: I think I am.

3056
02:47:29,768 --> 02:47:30,509
MATT: Yeah.

3057
02:47:30,509 --> 02:47:34,217
TALIESIN: Is this basically like the thing in
Superman 2 where Lex Luthor's playing chess--

3058
02:47:34,217 --> 02:47:36,442
TRAVIS: In the prison cell?

3059
02:47:36,442 --> 02:47:37,350
MATT: Kind of?

3060
02:47:37,350 --> 02:47:38,239
TALIESIN: Okay.

3061
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:40,893
MATT: You have to look up the spell for the
specifics,

3062
02:47:40,893 --> 02:47:42,798
but yeah, it's got some interesting uses.

3063
02:47:42,798 --> 02:47:43,793
SAM: Are you arcane?

3064
02:47:43,793 --> 02:47:45,083
LAURA: So basically it's you. You can use it.

3065
02:47:45,083 --> 02:47:46,293
SAM: Am I the only arcane?

3066
02:47:46,293 --> 02:47:46,881
LIAM: Yeah.

3067
02:47:46,881 --> 02:47:47,543
MATT: Yeah.

3068
02:47:47,543 --> 02:47:49,747
MARISHA: Yes, I'm a natural caster. You're the
only arcane caster.

3069
02:47:49,747 --> 02:47:51,722
LAURA: I mean, hold on to it in case we run into
Scanlan again.

3070
02:47:51,722 --> 02:47:53,092
TRAVIS: I am a powerful magician.

3071
02:47:53,092 --> 02:47:54,345
LAURA: Or you can use it.

3072
02:47:54,345 --> 02:47:58,236
TRAVIS: And with that, I take out the little gem
thing that I pulled off the other ship.

3073
02:47:58,236 --> 02:48:03,864
SAM: Ooh! Should I Identify that?

3074
02:48:03,864 --> 02:48:05,179
TALIESIN: You should Identify it.

3075
02:48:05,179 --> 02:48:05,850
MARISHA: You should.

3076
02:48:05,850 --> 02:48:07,938
SAM: Can I, more than once a day?

3077
02:48:07,938 --> 02:48:12,946
MATT: Look at the ability. It's the spell-- I
gotta look.

3078
02:48:12,946 --> 02:48:14,686
SAM: It's the Identify spell.

3079
02:48:14,686 --> 02:48:16,294
MATT: Yeah, it's a first-level spell.

3080
02:48:16,294 --> 02:48:17,911
MARISHA: All the papers. All the papers in the
world.

3081
02:48:17,911 --> 02:48:19,363
TALIESIN: I imagine you're sitting here going--

3082
02:48:19,363 --> 02:48:21,112
MATT: It's a first-level spell, so as long as you
have a first-level spell slot.

3083
02:48:21,112 --> 02:48:21,542
SAM: Oh.

3084
02:48:21,542 --> 02:48:23,367
LAURA: Oh, I have a spyglass, I didn't even need
to ask for Captain Adella's.

3085
02:48:23,367 --> 02:48:24,969
SAM: It's a ritual, though, is that--

3086
02:48:24,969 --> 02:48:27,109
MATT: Oh, yeah, if you can use it as a ritual,
then it won't use a spell slot when you do that.

3087
02:48:27,109 --> 02:48:28,732
MARISHA: You just do it, it just takes time.

3088
02:48:28,732 --> 02:48:32,542
SAM: All right. I will ritually Identify that.
What's that all about?

3089
02:48:32,542 --> 02:48:45,533
MATT: That is a fog marker. It can be used by
holding it a round, but it is generally used to

3090
02:48:45,533 --> 02:48:50,967
create a 100-foot-wide fog cloud that lasts for an
hour when used.

3091
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:54,154
SAM: Do we know how to activate it?

3092
02:48:54,154 --> 02:48:58,417
MATT: To activate it, you have to spend a
ten-minute period of time concentrating on the

3093
02:48:58,417 --> 02:49:03,913
orb, and then as it gets moved, it carries the fog
cloud with it and lasts for an hour.

3094
02:49:03,913 --> 02:49:04,680
LAURA: That's cool.

3095
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:05,612
SAM: Could be useful.

3096
02:49:05,612 --> 02:49:06,539
LAURA: Super useful.

3097
02:49:06,539 --> 02:49:11,045
TALIESIN: At the very least, it could be installed
in the ship. They could have it as a possible--

3098
02:49:11,045 --> 02:49:12,147
SAM: Cloaking device?

3099
02:49:12,147 --> 02:49:16,271
TRAVIS: You could put it in the guts of Dottie.

3100
02:49:16,271 --> 02:49:17,389
SAM: Doty.

3101
02:49:17,389 --> 02:49:18,281
TRAVIS: Yep.

3102
02:49:18,281 --> 02:49:19,300
LAURA: Deedee?

3103
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:20,529
MARISHA: Could you do that?

3104
02:49:20,529 --> 02:49:22,033
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's not like he's
hollow.

3105
02:49:22,033 --> 02:49:23,271
MARISHA: In Doodie?

3106
02:49:23,271 --> 02:49:25,517
SAM: I mean, he's got a lot of stuff in there.

3107
02:49:25,517 --> 02:49:27,401
TRAVIS: But that's not important, that stuff in
there.

3108
02:49:27,401 --> 02:49:29,052
LIAM: What kind of stuff?

3109
02:49:29,052 --> 02:49:29,810
TALIESIN: Things.

3110
02:49:29,810 --> 02:49:30,562
SAM: You know.

3111
02:49:30,562 --> 02:49:31,428
LIAM: No.

3112
02:49:31,428 --> 02:49:34,696
SAM: When you have two wheels and some ropes and
it makes a pulley system--

3113
02:49:34,696 --> 02:49:37,029
TRAVIS: Okay, no, just give it back to me,
I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding.

3114
02:49:37,029 --> 02:49:37,671
SAM: All right.

3115
02:49:37,671 --> 02:49:39,255
TRAVIS: Thanks.

3116
02:49:39,255 --> 02:49:42,154
TALIESIN: How big is the orb, out of curiosity?

3117
02:49:42,154 --> 02:49:47,477
MATT: The orb is maybe seven-inch diameter.
It's about that big.

3118
02:49:47,477 --> 02:49:50,036
TALIESIN: All right.

3119
02:49:50,036 --> 02:49:51,105
MARISHA: It's seven-inch--

3120
02:49:51,105 --> 02:49:54,379
MATT: Yeah, it's about that big.

3121
02:49:54,379 --> 02:49:56,511
TALIESIN: Interesting. All right.

3122
02:49:56,511 --> 02:49:59,312
MATT: So the ship is still progressing in that
direction.

3123
02:49:59,312 --> 02:50:02,951
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on it? On the
orb?

3124
02:50:02,951 --> 02:50:05,907
MATT: To? What do you want to do with the nature
check?

3125
02:50:05,907 --> 02:50:08,941
SAM: To see if it smells like nature.

3126
02:50:08,941 --> 02:50:12,067
MARISHA: Did it come from any Water Ashari,
or anything like that?

3127
02:50:12,067 --> 02:50:14,338
(all laugh)

3128
02:50:14,338 --> 02:50:15,836
TRAVIS: What?

3129
02:50:15,836 --> 02:50:17,244
MATT: Roll a nature check.

3130
02:50:17,244 --> 02:50:19,930
SAM: Are you my brother? Are you my brother?

3131
02:50:19,930 --> 02:50:22,708
(all laugh)

3132
02:50:22,708 --> 02:50:24,096
MARISHA: 14?

3133
02:50:24,096 --> 02:50:27,388
MATT: It looks like a magic item.

3134
02:50:27,388 --> 02:50:31,521
MARISHA: That's awesome. That's cool.

3135
02:50:31,521 --> 02:50:33,758
TALIESIN: Does it have smoke inside when 
you turn it?

3136
02:50:33,821 --> 02:50:35,054
MATT: Yeah, when you turn it--

3137
02:50:35,054 --> 02:50:36,751
TALIESIN: Like those weird balls filled with weird
sand--

3138
02:50:36,751 --> 02:50:39,528
MATT: Yeah, actually, it kinda looks like that.
As you shift it, it swirls on the inside.

3139
02:50:39,528 --> 02:50:43,607
It causes the air-- intense condensation that
eventually drips

3140
02:50:43,607 --> 02:50:45,760
from the outside of it when it's activated.

3141
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:46,579
LAURA: Cool.

3142
02:50:46,579 --> 02:50:48,008
MARISHA: (laughs) Outlook cloudy.

3143
02:50:48,008 --> 02:50:55,485
MATT: All right. So as everything rests down in
the ship you can use, you have about a day and a

3144
02:50:55,485 --> 02:50:59,383
half travel until you're supposed to reach the
islands.

3145
02:50:59,383 --> 02:51:05,368
TRAVIS: Can I post up outside of the brig where
stabbed-in-the-body McGee is sleeping?

3146
02:51:05,368 --> 02:51:06,490
MATT: Yeah. And as he--

3147
02:51:06,490 --> 02:51:08,608
TRAVIS: I'll forego my room. I just want to sleep
sitting up.

3148
02:51:08,608 --> 02:51:11,687
LIAM: Do we have rooms? I thought it was like Amex
City on this--

3149
02:51:11,687 --> 02:51:14,265
LAURA: No, we have rooms. But they're combined.

3150
02:51:14,265 --> 02:51:20,594
MATT: Yeah, they're clustered, you have many
people per room. They're like bunks. So yeah,

3151
02:51:20,594 --> 02:51:24,719
you post outside of the brig. As evening comes,
the night passes. Is there anything you want to

3152
02:51:24,719 --> 02:51:26,731
do? You just rest for the night?

3153
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:28,208
TRAVIS: Yeah, just keep the other guard company.

3154
02:51:28,208 --> 02:51:28,902
MATT: Okay.

3155
02:51:28,902 --> 02:51:30,516
TRAVIS: Just to give him a little expert help.

3156
02:51:30,516 --> 02:51:31,879
TALIESIN: We've been tinkering on the ship, so.

3157
02:51:31,879 --> 02:51:33,219
MATT: What have you been tinkering?

3158
02:51:33,219 --> 02:51:34,269
SAM: Science-bro stuff.

3159
02:51:34,269 --> 02:51:38,885
TALIESIN: Science-bro stuff. Do we have to tell
you what it is?

3160
02:51:38,885 --> 02:51:41,457
MATT: To tinker it, so I can give you a DC, yeah.

3161
02:51:41,457 --> 02:51:43,278
TALIESIN: So he's got this really cool--

3162
02:51:43,278 --> 02:51:45,464
MATT: "We tinkered something really cool.
Did it work?"

3163
02:51:45,464 --> 02:51:50,707
Sure, it succeeds. "We built Voltron."

3164
02:51:50,707 --> 02:51:54,591
TALIESIN: You were very cagey about knowing what
it is while we were on break,

3165
02:51:54,591 --> 02:51:57,246
so I didn't know if this was a thing.

3166
02:51:57,246 --> 02:52:05,984
SAM: So, using one of the opals from my Helm of
whatever, Brilliance,

3167
02:52:05,984 --> 02:52:11,308
he wanted to craft a housing for it--

3168
02:52:11,308 --> 02:52:15,596
TALIESIN: So I've built a couple housings for
these opals. So, you pop the opal in, and it will

3169
02:52:15,596 --> 02:52:19,506
allow it to create either a concentrated beam--

3170
02:52:19,506 --> 02:52:20,380
SAM: Spotlight.

3171
02:52:20,380 --> 02:52:25,234
TALIESIN: Spotlight, basically, like a little
flashlight, a radiant beam like a torch--

3172
02:52:25,234 --> 02:52:26,221
MARISHA: Floodlight.

3173
02:52:26,221 --> 02:52:31,351
TALIESIN: Like a floodlight, or while it's on
spotlight, it's got a little railroad thing,

3174
02:52:31,351 --> 02:52:35,264
it's got a little slot that will go in and give
me a little bit of a red vibe, so we can have a

3175
02:52:35,264 --> 02:52:39,765
low-light red light, and I'm also going to make a
little clip so I can stick it on my gun,

3176
02:52:39,765 --> 02:52:42,549
so I can have a little spotlight on my gun when
we're going through a--

3177
02:52:42,549 --> 02:52:45,210
LIAM: It also ensures you cannot get a prom date.

3178
02:52:45,210 --> 02:52:50,910
TALIESIN: Hey, I'm doing okay, just saying.
Percy doing okay.

3179
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:54,549
LAURA: I don't know, you've been tinkering a lot
lately.

3180
02:52:54,549 --> 02:52:58,849
MATT: Okay, so that's doable. The opal doesn't
perpetually glow--

3181
02:52:58,849 --> 02:53:05,854
SAM: Yeah, it lasts for an hour. Is that something
we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour,

3182
02:53:05,854 --> 02:53:08,484
like a battery, or is it just an hour, it's
off--

3183
02:53:08,484 --> 02:53:10,024
TALIESIN: And then we have to pop a new opal in.

3184
02:53:10,024 --> 02:53:11,382
MATT: Generally, you have to pop a new opal in.

3185
02:53:11,382 --> 02:53:12,727
SAM: Okay, no problem.

3186
02:53:12,727 --> 02:53:15,637
TALIESIN: But you crack the opal, you put it in,
it's like one hour of either flashlight,

3187
02:53:15,637 --> 02:53:19,730
and then a little blinder to turn it on and off--
it's basically like a little train lantern.

3188
02:53:19,730 --> 02:53:21,747
MARISHA: I was gonna say, like an old-school
lighthouse.

3189
02:53:21,747 --> 02:53:23,689
MATT: Go ahead and roll a tinker check.

3190
02:53:23,689 --> 02:53:24,618
TALIESIN: Doing this together?

3191
02:53:24,618 --> 02:53:25,476
SAM: Can I help him?

3192
02:53:25,476 --> 02:53:28,190
MATT: Yes, you would be giving him advantage as
you attempt to do that.

3193
02:53:28,190 --> 02:53:31,753
So you just roll it twice, Percy.

3194
02:53:31,753 --> 02:53:34,537
TALIESIN: That was pretty good.

3195
02:53:34,537 --> 02:53:38,091
SAM: Did we get two 16s?

3196
02:53:38,091 --> 02:53:39,280
TALIESIN: I got a 19.

3197
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:43,491
SAM: Oh. I got a 16, but I get plus ten with my
tinkerer's tools.

3198
02:53:43,491 --> 02:53:51,227
TALIESIN: And mine's proficiency bonus and dex
bonus on top of that 19? So that's 30.

3199
02:53:51,227 --> 02:53:55,461
MATT: Between the two of you guys, it is not an
issue. Even with your limited materials,

3200
02:53:55,461 --> 02:54:01,083
but your travel-tinkering capabilities-- you
manage to deftly create this seamless, beautiful,

3201
02:54:01,083 --> 02:54:03,247
you could sell it on the street.

3202
02:54:03,247 --> 02:54:06,528
TALIESIN: So they can-- we may even make a little
headband so they can pop it on.

3203
02:54:06,528 --> 02:54:07,835
SAM: Sure, sure.

3204
02:54:07,835 --> 02:54:14,361
MATT: (laughs) You guys are so cute. All right.

3205
02:54:14,361 --> 02:54:16,956
MARISHA: I spend my evening reconnecting with
Vax.

3206
02:54:16,956 --> 02:54:17,727
MATT: Okay.

3207
02:54:17,727 --> 02:54:20,890
(all laugh)

3208
02:54:20,890 --> 02:54:24,841
SAM: The Hallmark card way of saying fucking.

3209
02:54:24,841 --> 02:54:31,208
TALIESIN: Well, there goes our sponsor by
Hallmark.

3210
02:54:31,208 --> 02:54:33,280
MATT: Yeah, thanks. Sorry, Hallmark.

3211
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:36,159
LIAM: It's a couple days-- we've been traveling
for a while, right?

3212
02:54:36,159 --> 02:54:38,234
MATT: It was three days before this encounter,
you have a day and a half left.

3213
02:54:38,234 --> 02:54:40,268
LIAM: And has a day passed since that fight?

3214
02:54:40,268 --> 02:54:41,105
LAURA: No.

3215
02:54:41,105 --> 02:54:42,305
LIAM: No, this is that night?

3216
02:54:42,305 --> 02:54:43,375
LAURA: This is that night, yeah.

3217
02:54:43,375 --> 02:54:44,506
MATT: This is the evening afterward.

3218
02:54:44,506 --> 02:54:46,571
TALIESIN: I'll see if I get my charges back.

3219
02:54:46,571 --> 02:54:54,601
MARISHA: I don't want to say I feel like I'm being
replaced. You know? It's not that. It's just that

3220
02:54:54,601 --> 02:54:57,389
Percy's kinda found a new friend.

3221
02:54:57,389 --> 02:54:58,820
LIAM: You're losing some friends.

3222
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:00,286
TALIESIN: We're not hanging out all the time,
we're being social.

3223
02:55:00,286 --> 02:55:03,375
MARISHA: No, it's not that. I'm a good friend,
right?

3224
02:55:03,375 --> 02:55:04,470
LIAM: Oh hi, Percy.

3225
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:06,427
SAM: I was going to say we're being social.

3226
02:55:06,427 --> 02:55:08,315
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You guys aren't 
there. I got distracted.

3227
02:55:08,315 --> 02:55:12,152
MATT: No, you guys are busy tinkering. You two 
are having a conversation where

3228
02:55:12,152 --> 02:55:14,629
Vax is trying to console Keyleth's sudden
friendship crisis.

3229
02:55:14,629 --> 02:55:16,772
SAM: Oh! Oh! You've got a little smudge
right there.

3230
02:55:16,772 --> 02:55:18,117
MARISHA: I mean, I know I can't--

3231
02:55:18,117 --> 02:55:19,793
LIAM: You're missing your friendo time, I 
understand.

3232
02:55:19,793 --> 02:55:21,741
(all laugh)

3233
02:55:21,741 --> 02:55:23,292
MARISHA: I can't fulfill every need.

3234
02:55:23,292 --> 02:55:24,864
LIAM: We hear them laughing from their
room.

3235
02:55:24,864 --> 02:55:26,200
(all laugh)

3236
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:27,156
TALIESIN: (snorts)

3237
02:55:27,156 --> 02:55:28,771
MATT: It is a very thin wall.

3238
02:55:28,771 --> 02:55:29,855
TRAVIS: Yes, snorting.

3239
02:55:29,855 --> 02:55:31,311
SAM: And it was the metric system!

3240
02:55:31,311 --> 02:55:32,654
SAM and TALIESIN: (exaggerated laugh)

3241
02:55:32,654 --> 02:55:39,361
(all laugh)

3242
02:55:39,361 --> 02:55:44,250
MARISHA: I will never know what the metric system 
means. I don't know what that is.

3243
02:55:44,250 --> 02:55:50,289
LIAM: They're both, you know, really special and--

3244
02:55:50,289 --> 02:55:53,512
MARISHA: I'm still a good friend, right? I'm still
a good friend?

3245
02:55:53,512 --> 02:55:54,237
LIAM: Yeah.

3246
02:55:54,237 --> 02:55:55,109
MARISHA: Am I a good friend?

3247
02:55:55,109 --> 02:55:56,335
LIAM: Yeah. You're his best friend.

3248
02:55:56,335 --> 02:55:57,118
MARISHA: All right.

3249
02:55:57,118 --> 02:55:58,203
LIAM: Yeah, that's just new--

3250
02:55:58,203 --> 02:55:59,092
MARISHA: Okay.

3251
02:55:59,092 --> 02:56:00,343
LIAM: -- and those two have never
met--

3252
02:56:00,343 --> 02:56:00,978
MARISHA: No, I know.

3253
02:56:00,978 --> 02:56:02,744
LIAM: -- a nerd as pure as the other.

3254
02:56:02,744 --> 02:56:03,665
SAM: (laughs)

3255
02:56:03,665 --> 02:56:08,138
MARISHA: I know I told them to like, bond 
but now-- I mean (sighs).

3256
02:56:08,138 --> 02:56:12,977
No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool.

3257
02:56:12,977 --> 02:56:14,224
LIAM: You're more than cool.

3258
02:56:14,224 --> 02:56:15,423
MARISHA: I've missed you.

3259
02:56:15,423 --> 02:56:17,163
LIAM: (chuckles) Hi.

3260
02:56:17,163 --> 02:56:20,049
MARISHA: Hi. (crying sounds)

3261
02:56:20,049 --> 02:56:23,125
(all laugh)

3262
02:56:23,125 --> 02:56:25,648
LIAM: I dry the tears away. Do you know--

3263
02:56:25,648 --> 02:56:29,143
MARISHA: (tearfully) New guy and the new guy
dynamic!

3264
02:56:29,143 --> 02:56:33,799
And I don't know what the new guy's
chemistry's like!

3265
02:56:33,799 --> 02:56:40,605
LIAM: Do you know what's really cool, though? We're
not on the verge of death every fucking day right now.

3266
02:56:40,605 --> 02:56:41,893
MARISHA: (tearfully) That's true.

3267
02:56:41,893 --> 02:56:44,978
LIAM: Yeah, you know, pluses and minuses.

3268
02:56:44,978 --> 02:56:48,145
MARISHA: (tearfully) I'm glad the new guy's the
worst of our problems.

3269
02:56:48,145 --> 02:56:51,164
(all laugh)

3270
02:56:51,164 --> 02:56:52,976
LIAM: Come here, you.

3271
02:56:52,976 --> 02:56:54,745
MARISHA: (tearfully) I just love Percy so much.

3272
02:56:54,745 --> 02:56:56,550
LIAM: I know, I know.

3273
02:56:56,550 --> 02:56:57,489
MATT: Aw.

3274
02:56:57,489 --> 02:56:58,800
LIAM: I know.

3275
02:56:58,800 --> 02:57:00,346
MATT: An evening of consoling and the rest of you
guys get your evening's rest,

3276
02:57:00,346 --> 02:57:03,789
you outside the brig, uneventful.

3277
02:57:03,789 --> 02:57:07,206
LAURA: I did want to talk, but that's okay.

3278
02:57:07,206 --> 02:57:08,187
TALIESIN: I get that.

3279
02:57:08,187 --> 02:57:09,183
LAURA: I can talk later.

3280
02:57:09,183 --> 02:57:11,888
MATT: Oh, did you want to talk? Go for it. 
Go for it.

3281
02:57:11,888 --> 02:57:12,885
TRAVIS: (burps)

3282
02:57:12,885 --> 02:57:14,086
LIAM: Go interrupt the party.

3283
02:57:14,086 --> 02:57:14,957
LAURA: Yeah no, I was going to.

3284
02:57:14,957 --> 02:57:17,299
TALIESIN; Well, I was going to say, you're welcome.
We're finishing up, you're welcome in.

3285
02:57:17,299 --> 02:57:18,627
MARISHA: (sobs)

3286
02:57:18,627 --> 02:57:19,786
LAURA: Oh! Only when you're finishing up.

3287
02:57:19,786 --> 02:57:20,772
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3288
02:57:20,772 --> 02:57:23,257
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know when you were--
We obviously did it.

3289
02:57:23,257 --> 02:57:24,435
SAM: We built our--

3290
02:57:24,435 --> 02:57:25,780
TALIESIN: I love that so much, it's so--

3291
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:27,045
TRAVIS: Wow, wow.

3292
02:57:27,045 --> 02:57:27,672
LIAM: Did it?

3293
02:57:27,672 --> 02:57:28,651
TALIESIN: Yeah, we put the whole thing
together.

3294
02:57:28,651 --> 02:57:29,553
LIAM: Put the whole thing?

3295
02:57:29,553 --> 02:57:30,652
TALIESIN: The whole thing put together.

3296
02:57:30,652 --> 02:57:31,544
MATT: Phrasing.

3297
02:57:31,544 --> 02:57:32,365
LIAM: Sure, yeah.

3298
02:57:32,365 --> 02:57:33,364
MARISHA: Man, you're going for it.

3299
02:57:33,364 --> 02:57:35,493
(all laugh)

3300
02:57:35,493 --> 02:57:39,935
MATT: You hear, as you guys are finishing up,
you hear a knock at the door.

3301
02:57:39,935 --> 02:57:41,600
TRAVIS: Cleaning up your--

3302
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:42,619
LAURA: Hello?

3303
02:57:42,619 --> 02:57:44,626
TALIESIN: Yes! Come in.

3304
02:57:44,626 --> 02:57:46,347
LAURA: Is it filled with smoke in here?

3305
02:57:46,347 --> 02:57:47,498
MARISHA: (laughs)

3306
02:57:47,498 --> 02:57:49,870
LAURA: Oh, hi Tary. I didn't see you.

3307
02:57:49,870 --> 02:57:51,218
SAM: We were welding.

3308
02:57:51,218 --> 02:57:54,116
LAURA: Fun! Exciting! On a boat, even. Wow.

3309
02:57:54,116 --> 02:57:55,327
TALIESIN: It's relatively safe.

3310
02:57:55,327 --> 02:57:57,599
LAURA: So! What'd you make?

3311
02:57:57,599 --> 02:57:58,755
TALIESIN: (sighs) Can I crack one?

3312
02:57:58,755 --> 02:57:59,675
SAM: Let's do it.

3313
02:57:59,675 --> 02:58:00,443
TALIESIN: All right.

3314
02:58:00,443 --> 02:58:01,599
SAM: Oh wait, we're using one?

3315
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:02,359
TALIESIN: We're using one.

3316
02:58:02,359 --> 02:58:05,069
SAM: All right, sure. Why not? It's 1000
gold, but okay, sure.

3317
02:58:05,069 --> 02:58:07,945
(all laugh)

3318
02:58:07,945 --> 02:58:09,383
TALIESIN: It's his father's money.

3319
02:58:09,383 --> 02:58:10,617
LAURA: (laughs)

3320
02:58:10,617 --> 02:58:12,725
MATT: (crack, dink) As he flicks the opal, 
it gives off

3321
02:58:12,725 --> 02:58:14,834
a bright equivalent of the Light spell.

3322
02:58:14,834 --> 02:58:15,701
LAURA: Oh.

3323
02:58:15,701 --> 02:58:18,108
SAM: Daylight.

3324
02:58:18,108 --> 02:58:19,475
MATT: Daylight! I'm sorry. This is--

3325
02:58:19,475 --> 02:58:20,455
LAURA: Oh, shit.

3326
02:58:20,455 --> 02:58:21,148
MATT: Yeah.

3327
02:58:21,148 --> 02:58:22,265
SAM: The power of the sun.

3328
02:58:22,265 --> 02:58:23,222
LAURA: That's powerful.

3329
02:58:23,222 --> 02:58:25,208
MATT: Basically, there's a sun in the room
suddenly (crackle).

3330
02:58:25,208 --> 02:58:26,199
TALIESIN: Wait.

3331
02:58:26,199 --> 02:58:27,528
LAURA: Oh wow, you guys made a--

3332
02:58:27,528 --> 02:58:29,686
MATT: You're literally blinded for a moment.

3333
02:58:29,686 --> 02:58:30,410
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3334
02:58:30,410 --> 02:58:31,729
MATT: Your eyes just go (crackle).

3335
02:58:31,729 --> 02:58:33,729
TALIESIN: We put it in the box, contain it.

3336
02:58:33,729 --> 02:58:35,741
SAM: Well, wait, open it just a little bit.

3337
02:58:35,741 --> 02:58:36,648
TALIESIN: All right.

3338
02:58:36,648 --> 02:58:40,365
SAM: And then I'm gonna take my Helm of Brilliance
and just put one of the diamonds up to

3339
02:58:40,365 --> 02:58:44,850
the laser beam like light coming out so it makes
like a dazzling light across the--

3340
02:58:44,850 --> 02:58:45,597
LAURA: Wow.

3341
02:58:45,597 --> 02:58:49,590
MATT: It's a beautiful prism, which you're
able to see in about 40 seconds.

3342
02:58:49,590 --> 02:58:51,889
(all laugh)

3343
02:58:51,889 --> 02:58:54,797
LAURA: It's a lot, it's just a lot of spots right 
now, but I'm sure.

3344
02:58:54,797 --> 02:58:55,715
TALIESIN: Sorry.

3345
02:58:55,715 --> 02:59:01,946
LAURA: Eventually. Oh! Pretty. Um, get out.
You, not you. If you don't mind.

3346
02:59:01,946 --> 02:59:02,875
SAM: I don't at all.

3347
02:59:02,875 --> 02:59:03,882
LAURA: I mean, of course you can stay--

3348
02:59:03,882 --> 02:59:04,905
TALIESIN: Get out. It's okay.

3349
02:59:04,905 --> 02:59:05,854
SAM: I have a lot of dictation to do.

3350
02:59:05,854 --> 02:59:08,444
TALIESIN: Out, out, out, out, out.

3351
02:59:08,444 --> 02:59:09,683
LAURA: (quietly) Hi.

3352
02:59:09,683 --> 02:59:13,993
TALIESIN: And I boot him out. Oh hi, thank god. 
And--

3353
02:59:13,993 --> 02:59:15,181
LAURA: So, Percy.

3354
02:59:15,181 --> 02:59:16,152
TALIESIN: Yes, dear?

3355
02:59:16,152 --> 02:59:17,782
LAURA: I've been meaning to bring something
up to you.

3356
02:59:17,782 --> 02:59:19,650
TALIESIN: Yes?

3357
02:59:19,650 --> 02:59:23,483
LAURA: At the risk of bringing up Scanlan again--

3358
02:59:23,483 --> 02:59:24,611
TALIESIN: Oh.

3359
02:59:24,611 --> 02:59:26,129
LAURA: Something I'd rather ignore.

3360
02:59:26,129 --> 02:59:27,853
TALIESIN: Yes, me too.

3361
02:59:27,853 --> 02:59:36,155
LAURA: When he left, he said something that caught
my ear, which was that he heard.

3362
02:59:36,155 --> 02:59:45,423
He heard Pike and his daughter, calling to him.

3363
02:59:45,423 --> 02:59:46,263
TALIESIN: Yes.

3364
02:59:46,263 --> 02:59:51,693
LAURA: From the other side. Which is strange 
really, because when I was on the other side,

3365
02:59:51,693 --> 03:00:01,666
I don't remember hearing anything. What about
you?

3366
03:00:01,666 --> 03:00:06,274
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm gonna sit down and open up a
bottle.

3367
03:00:06,370 --> 03:00:10,392
LAURA: Busting out the Courage again?

3368
03:00:10,392 --> 03:00:12,607
TALIESIN: The Courage, I think, is long gone 
at this point.

3369
03:00:12,607 --> 03:00:13,281
MATT: Yeah.

3370
03:00:13,281 --> 03:00:18,700
TALIESIN: I'm going for the Tear whiskey, fuck it
Take a swing, and I pass.

3371
03:00:18,763 --> 03:00:20,152
LAURA: Mm.

3372
03:00:20,152 --> 03:00:40,826
TALIESIN: I was not in a good place, I was-- what 
I am choosing to describe as great motivation

3373
03:00:40,826 --> 03:00:57,546
to live a long life. There was pain and sound and 
I've tried hard not to think about creating words

3374
03:00:57,546 --> 03:01:07,726
to articulate it, but it was the feeling of being--
it was not pain without end, it felt like pain

3375
03:01:07,726 --> 03:01:11,884
that would have an end because eventually there
would be nothing left of me.

3376
03:01:11,884 --> 03:01:20,508
I felt consumed. And yes, I heard.
It was the only thing I heard.

3377
03:01:20,508 --> 03:01:28,451
Yes. I know you well enough to know-- 
trying not to embarrass you, but--

3378
03:01:28,451 --> 03:01:29,687
LAURA: All right.

3379
03:01:29,687 --> 03:01:30,503
TALIESIN: -- yes.

3380
03:01:30,503 --> 03:01:31,972
LAURA: I'm not embarrassed.

3381
03:01:31,972 --> 03:01:37,935
TALIESIN: Well, I would've, honestly--
I would've never hoped otherwise.

3382
03:01:37,935 --> 03:01:41,595
You're far too wonderful for an idiot.

3383
03:01:41,595 --> 03:01:43,504
LAURA: (laughs)

3384
03:01:43,504 --> 03:01:56,960
TALIESIN: So (sighs), but I'm more hopeful. 
I'm not quite as fearful of whether-- I'm worrying

3385
03:01:56,960 --> 03:02:01,596
less about what may happen when I die again 
and if I'm going to go back there.

3386
03:02:01,596 --> 03:02:05,466
LAURA: Well, that's good. I would hope
he's not waiting on the other side for you.

3387
03:02:05,466 --> 03:02:07,121
TALIESIN: I hope not either, and--

3388
03:02:07,121 --> 03:02:10,557
LAURA: What about when you were killed by Raishan?

3389
03:02:10,557 --> 03:02:22,083
TALIESIN: That was quick. It was fine, but it was 
quick, so I'm not sure if that means anything yet.

3390
03:02:22,083 --> 03:02:29,426
I've overthought this quite a bit and I don't
know if you care to hear too many of my fears in

3391
03:02:29,426 --> 03:02:33,498
this direction, but, I do think about it.

3392
03:02:33,498 --> 03:02:37,192
LAURA: You can always tell me your fears, Percy.

3393
03:02:37,192 --> 03:02:46,524
TALIESIN: Where do the people I kill go? I know 
you don't have an answer,

3394
03:02:46,524 --> 03:02:49,652
I don't have an answer either, but--

3395
03:02:49,652 --> 03:02:54,070
LAURA: I don't, I suppose it depends on them, 
doesn't it?

3396
03:02:54,070 --> 03:03:01,635
TALIESIN: Does it? Or does it depend on me? Or
does it now depend on this thing?

3397
03:03:01,635 --> 03:03:08,928
LAURA: You don't think they were doomed to suffer
the same fate that you were?

3398
03:03:08,928 --> 03:03:12,276
TALIESIN: Maybe. I don't know, maybe I keep
feeding it every time--

3399
03:03:12,276 --> 03:03:14,145
LAURA: Oh no.

3400
03:03:14,145 --> 03:03:18,967
TALIESIN: I don't quite know how to find out, 
other than I had a moment

3401
03:03:18,967 --> 03:03:23,729
where I thought about shooting someone, 
bringing them back and asking them.

3402
03:03:23,729 --> 03:03:25,674
LAURA: (gasps)

3403
03:03:25,674 --> 03:03:30,752
TALIESIN: There was a moment I thought 
about shooting someone.

3404
03:03:30,752 --> 03:03:36,570
Well, if it comes to it, it's something I've had

3405
03:03:36,570 --> 03:03:39,945
in my back pocket as killing two birds with one
stone.

3406
03:03:39,945 --> 03:03:44,125
LAURA: Maybe we can just try that on
someone who we already need to kill.

3407
03:03:44,125 --> 03:03:45,562
TALIESIN: That's my thought.

3408
03:03:45,562 --> 03:03:46,399
LAURA: Right.

3409
03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:54,934
TALIESIN: And, I worry about what 
all of this is doing to us,

3410
03:03:54,934 --> 03:04:13,601
but at the same time, I have such faith in-- I
have such faith in you and Keyleth, and

3411
03:04:13,601 --> 03:04:16,002
occasionally Grog, and occasionally your
brother.

3412
03:04:16,002 --> 03:04:20,204
LAURA: (laughs) Are you listening?

3413
03:04:20,204 --> 03:04:28,903
TALIESIN: (laughs) But I'm starting to
wonder if this is what all those heroes I read

3414
03:04:28,903 --> 03:04:33,826
about when I was young, if this is what they felt,
is just a lot of getting very comfortable with

3415
03:04:33,826 --> 03:04:36,435
not knowing and being nervous and wondering if
you're really

3416
03:04:36,435 --> 03:04:40,084
just the villain of someone else's story.

3417
03:04:40,084 --> 03:04:43,264
LAURA: I'm sure that's how they feel.

3418
03:04:43,264 --> 03:04:45,952
No one's ever sure they're doing the right
thing.

3419
03:04:45,952 --> 03:04:51,582
TALIESIN: But I did hear you, sorry to-- I
did hear you and sorry that I didn't say.

3420
03:04:51,582 --> 03:04:59,771
LAURA: No, it's all right. Takes the pressure
off, really, knowing that you know.

3421
03:04:59,771 --> 03:05:08,832
TALIESIN: I treasure every minute, and you remind
me to not be so serious.

3422
03:05:08,832 --> 03:05:10,760
LAURA: Yes. So serious.

3423
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:14,761
TALIESIN: I'm not saying that you're not
serious but-- (sighs)

3424
03:05:14,761 --> 03:05:17,383
LAURA: (exasperated voice) You can go play 
with Tary some more if you like.

3425
03:05:17,383 --> 03:05:20,038
TALIESIN: I'm done with Tary for the evening.

3426
03:05:20,038 --> 03:05:21,613
LAURA: Great! Then you can play with
me!

3427
03:05:21,613 --> 03:05:23,846
(all laugh)

3428
03:05:23,846 --> 03:05:27,445
TALIESIN: And crossing the whiskey off the
inventory.

3429
03:05:27,445 --> 03:05:28,668
MATT: Off the-- yeah.

3430
03:05:28,668 --> 03:05:31,003
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3431
03:05:31,003 --> 03:05:32,164
MATT: All right, as the evening--

3432
03:05:32,164 --> 03:05:33,055
TRAVIS: Amazing.

3433
03:05:33,055 --> 03:05:37,516
MATT: -- the evening comes to a close, 
the next day's journey is met

3434
03:05:37,516 --> 03:05:43,842
with a coming cloudfront, does not appear to be
storm-bearing clouds but the clear skies seem to

3435
03:05:43,842 --> 03:05:45,935
have come to an end.

3436
03:05:45,935 --> 03:05:51,607
MARISHA: I'm restless in
all of my night's sleep as we get closer.

3437
03:05:51,607 --> 03:06:01,260
MATT: Mm-hm. As the next day comes to a close,
the sun setting, you hear a call from the top of

3438
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:05,732
the crow's nest that shouts out, "Land
ho!"

3439
03:06:05,732 --> 03:06:08,848
LAURA: We go running up.

3440
03:06:08,848 --> 03:06:10,532
MATT: You guys all catch up and you can see--

3441
03:06:10,532 --> 03:06:11,731
LIAM: (quietly) You got this.

3442
03:06:11,731 --> 03:06:12,437
MARISHA: (groans)

3443
03:06:12,437 --> 03:06:17,007
MATT: -- just as the last bit of sunlit glow 
behind the clouds begins to fade into darkness,

3444
03:06:17,007 --> 03:06:22,361
you see ahead the gentle shape of islands just
breaking the horizon ahead,

3445
03:06:22,361 --> 03:06:27,970
and one by one, little lights (click click click) 
coming on.

3446
03:06:27,970 --> 03:06:34,438
MARISHA: I rush to the bow of the ship.

3447
03:06:34,438 --> 03:06:38,387
MATT: As you come up to the bow of the
ship, you can see at this point now,

3448
03:06:38,387 --> 03:06:41,337
Captain Adella is starting to shout off 
to the side,

3449
03:06:41,337 --> 03:06:44,838
"Keep it all high!" and is currently moving
around and you see there are three guys at the

3450
03:06:44,838 --> 03:06:49,252
front who all have lanterns out and they're
watching the water below and they're shouting out,

3451
03:06:49,252 --> 03:06:56,446
"Five to the right!" and they're giving different
degrees and she's navigating through what looks to

3452
03:06:56,446 --> 03:07:03,577
be a channel of reefs, as you glance over the
edge. And you can see there are pathways here,

3453
03:07:03,577 --> 03:07:08,656
but it looks like a lot of this water is very
dangerous water and eventually you get to a point

3454
03:07:08,656 --> 03:07:14,088
where one of them shouts, "Stop! Stop!" and they
immediately throw down the sails and someone

3455
03:07:14,088 --> 03:07:19,277
throws the anchor off the side and the ship
(crunching) comes and slams to a halt as the

3456
03:07:19,277 --> 03:07:23,713
anchor clicks and you can feel it grinding for a
bit as it catches the edge of one of-- it looks

3457
03:07:23,713 --> 03:07:27,752
like a reef below, but the ship eventually stops
as you glance over, there maybe 15 feet away from

3458
03:07:27,752 --> 03:07:33,528
hitting the edge of a reef. (grinding sound) It
stops and the water (whistling) slowly comes to

3459
03:07:33,528 --> 03:07:42,569
rest as the ship comes to a rest. Looking over the
edge, you can see the water maybe about 20 or so

3460
03:07:42,569 --> 03:07:46,881
feet down with what little bit of light the
lanterns have put over, you can see the very top

3461
03:07:46,881 --> 03:07:54,926
of various reef cliffs and hints of beach shelf
beginning to rise up towards this cluster of

3462
03:07:54,926 --> 03:08:00,896
almost like still fairy lights in the distance,
unmoving. Captain Adella comes up to the edge of

3463
03:08:00,896 --> 03:08:02,258
the ship and goes,

3464
03:08:02,258 --> 03:08:07,552
"Well, that's about as far as
we can get with this ship. My apologies."

3465
03:08:07,552 --> 03:08:16,378
MARISHA: No, this is fantastic.
And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a

3466
03:08:16,378 --> 03:08:21,986
Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water
and make a rainbow over top of us.

3467
03:08:21,986 --> 03:08:23,017
MATT: Wow.

3468
03:08:23,017 --> 03:08:24,437
MARISHA: (tch boom) Ooh.

3469
03:08:24,437 --> 03:08:28,380
MATT: So with that
(pffff) the spray of vapor in the air of the night

3470
03:08:28,380 --> 03:08:32,595
sky, the darkness ahead of you that was
currently-- the clouds obscuring any sort of

3471
03:08:32,595 --> 03:08:38,512
starlight, suddenly is showered with a spray of
vibrant colors across the entire spectrum,

3472
03:08:38,512 --> 03:08:43,500
as the vapor slowly cascades around each side of
the ship. As it does, a few moments pass and you

3473
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:51,124
watch more lights spark open in the distance (puff
puff puff puff puff) whatever the source is,

3474
03:08:51,124 --> 03:08:56,284
you begin to get a clearer view and there you can
just barely begin to see the edges of what appear

3475
03:08:56,284 --> 03:09:03,313
to be a very, very faint outline of a number of
buildings all springing up from the water itself.

3476
03:09:03,313 --> 03:09:05,428
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh shit.

3477
03:09:05,428 --> 03:09:09,138
MATT: The city is not on one of the islands, 
the city is in the center of them,

3478
03:09:09,138 --> 03:09:14,719
there's a triangulation of these land masses and 
the city itself resides between all three.

3479
03:09:14,719 --> 03:09:15,863
SAM: (quietly) Wow.

3480
03:09:15,863 --> 03:09:20,983
MATT: Some of the guys in the front of the ship 
start taking small rowing boats and

3481
03:09:20,983 --> 03:09:26,620
taking them up and latching them in and setting 
them off the side into the more shallow waters below.

3482
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:29,848
MARISHA: I run past all of them and just jump 
into the water,

3483
03:09:29,848 --> 03:09:33,170
not gracefully like before and start
swimming.

3484
03:09:33,170 --> 03:09:34,437
MATT: Make a perception check.

3485
03:09:34,437 --> 03:09:35,259
(all groan)

3486
03:09:35,259 --> 03:09:35,949
LAURA: Oh no.

3487
03:09:35,949 --> 03:09:36,804
MARISHA: Perception check?

3488
03:09:36,804 --> 03:09:37,366
MATT: Yes.

3489
03:09:37,366 --> 03:09:38,111
LAURA: We're at a reef!

3490
03:09:38,111 --> 03:09:38,973
LIAM: Don't face-plant on a reef!

3491
03:09:38,973 --> 03:09:41,232
MARISHA: Fine. Ooh!

3492
03:09:41,232 --> 03:09:42,237
TALIESIN: There is now!

3493
03:09:42,237 --> 03:09:43,772
LIAM: I'm on a reef.

3494
03:09:43,772 --> 03:09:45,381
MARISHA: Oh that's just a dexterity
check?

3495
03:09:45,381 --> 03:09:46,391
MATT: No, perception.

3496
03:09:46,391 --> 03:09:46,969
SAM: Perception.

3497
03:09:46,969 --> 03:09:48,893
MARISHA: Oh, perception. 28.

3498
03:09:48,893 --> 03:09:51,557
MATT: You run to the edge and right as you're
about to leap, you look and realize

3499
03:09:51,557 --> 03:09:54,335
there's relatively shallow reef in the direction 
you're about to leap,

3500
03:09:54,335 --> 03:09:58,809
so you kinda turn and (laughs) go at an angle 
instead and (plop) into the water below.

3501
03:09:58,809 --> 03:10:00,325
MARISHA: (nervous sounds)

3502
03:10:00,325 --> 03:10:03,748
MATT: A second, almost a second after you,
the ship (cracks) hits the water below and they

3503
03:10:03,748 --> 03:10:08,552
start throwing down the rope ladder and you guys
are allowed to then step into the rowboat.

3504
03:10:08,629 --> 03:10:09,942
LAURA: Broom.

3505
03:10:09,942 --> 03:10:10,855
TALIESIN: Carpet?

3506
03:10:10,855 --> 03:10:12,792
MATT: You have the broom. Or carpet if you like?

3507
03:10:12,792 --> 03:10:13,853
MARISHA: I just start--

3508
03:10:13,853 --> 03:10:17,058
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get on the carpet and
offer it to anybody who likes.

3509
03:10:17,058 --> 03:10:18,476
MARISHA: Using my cantrips--

3510
03:10:18,476 --> 03:10:20,392
TRAVIS: Well, I need the boat 'cause I'm
heavy.

3511
03:10:20,475 --> 03:10:22,062
TALIESIN: What about the boat?

3512
03:10:22,062 --> 03:10:25,456
SAM: I want to be on the flying carpet,
'cause that's amazing.

3513
03:10:25,456 --> 03:10:27,596
LAURA: Trinket will get in a boat with Grog.

3514
03:10:27,596 --> 03:10:28,635
LIAM: What are you doing?

3515
03:10:28,635 --> 03:10:30,019
LAURA: No! Trinket's gonna be in my necklace.

3516
03:10:30,019 --> 03:10:31,685
MATT: All right. Trinket goes in the necklace.

3517
03:10:31,685 --> 03:10:32,693
LAURA: Yeah, for a minute.

3518
03:10:32,693 --> 03:10:33,931
LIAM: Hopping on behind my sister.

3519
03:10:33,931 --> 03:10:35,787
MATT: Okay, so your sister, you guys are taking 
the carpet--

3520
03:10:35,787 --> 03:10:36,504
SAM: Yes!

3521
03:10:36,504 --> 03:10:38,178
MATT: -- Grog, you're going in the boat?

3522
03:10:38,178 --> 03:10:39,847
TRAVIS: I got my own rowboat.

3523
03:10:39,847 --> 03:10:40,902
MATT: (laughs)

3524
03:10:40,902 --> 03:10:42,450
TALIESIN: With a robot. Robot in the--

3525
03:10:42,450 --> 03:10:43,311
SAM: Oh yeah! The robot is--

3526
03:10:43,311 --> 03:10:45,280
TRAVIS: No. Dottie is not coming with me.

3527
03:10:45,280 --> 03:10:46,840
TALIESIN: Dottie is coming with you.

3528
03:10:46,912 --> 03:10:48,109
SAM: Well, he can come on the--

3529
03:10:48,109 --> 03:10:49,514
LAURA: No, he can't. It's too heavy. 
It's too heavy for the carpet.

3530
03:10:49,514 --> 03:10:50,913
TALIESIN: Doty cannot come on the carpet.

3531
03:10:50,913 --> 03:10:52,281
MATT: It's too heavy to go on the carpet.

3532
03:10:52,281 --> 03:10:53,879
SAM: I have to stay behind with Doty.

3533
03:10:53,879 --> 03:10:54,875
TALIESIN: Yeah well, have fun.

3534
03:10:54,875 --> 03:10:55,765
TRAVIS: Yep, see you later.

3535
03:10:55,765 --> 03:10:57,280
LAURA: Get him on a boat.
Get on a boat, Tary.

3536
03:10:57,280 --> 03:10:58,633
SAM: Is there another rowboat for us?

3537
03:10:58,633 --> 03:11:01,241
MATT: They have other rowboats on
the side, you can request another one.

3538
03:11:01,241 --> 03:11:03,410
SAM: I would like to request another rowboat
for Doty.

3539
03:11:03,410 --> 03:11:05,516
MARISHA: (laughing) A boat for Doty.

3540
03:11:05,516 --> 03:11:07,033
MATT: Okay, so as you guys begin making your
way,

3541
03:11:07,033 --> 03:11:08,918
roughly five minutes behind you, 
as you all are

3542
03:11:08,918 --> 03:11:13,462
kinda moving forward together via carpet, flight,
and her swimming, and Grog strongly pushing his

3543
03:11:13,462 --> 03:11:17,897
way through, Tary's just impatiently waiting for
them to get the other boat off the side of the

3544
03:11:17,897 --> 03:11:21,006
ship and they're slowly lowering it down,
kind of the ropes

3545
03:11:21,006 --> 03:11:24,045
having to adjust as it goes and you're 
like (groans).

3546
03:11:24,045 --> 03:11:27,308
(all laugh)

3547
03:11:27,308 --> 03:11:30,374
TRAVIS: I see adventure over this way! 
Too bad you won't be there to see it!

3548
03:11:30,374 --> 03:11:31,616
SAM: I'm missing it, hurry up!

3549
03:11:31,616 --> 03:11:33,287
(all laugh)

3550
03:11:33,287 --> 03:11:40,627
MATT: As you guys begin to approach, Keyleth, your
feet eventually hit sand as opposed to treading

3551
03:11:40,627 --> 03:11:43,879
water, and as you begin to walk up, the water
comes past your waist,

3552
03:11:43,879 --> 03:11:47,393
down to eventually your knees, and that is about
as low as it goes.

3553
03:11:47,393 --> 03:11:48,952
MARISHA: As far as it goes, yeah.

3554
03:11:48,952 --> 03:11:50,255
MATT: And looking out above you,

3555
03:11:50,255 --> 03:11:53,455
you can see this beautiful lagoon that is
completely submerged in about a foot, foot and a

3556
03:11:53,455 --> 03:12:01,551
half of water for a good mile in all directions.
And you can see dozens and dozens of these

3557
03:12:01,551 --> 03:12:08,832
Grecian looking white and green marble structures
that rise up out of the water. You can see a

3558
03:12:08,832 --> 03:12:14,591
series of poles that stand up holding these
lanterns that have all been magically set alight

3559
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:21,429
to give the city a sort of a glow. You see shapes
moving, you see figures shifting out of these

3560
03:12:21,429 --> 03:12:26,827
buildings and making their way in your direction,
and as you're looking at this space in front of

3561
03:12:26,827 --> 03:12:31,299
you and you guys begin to kind of meet up,
you watch as a figure (whoosh) out of the water

3562
03:12:31,353 --> 03:12:39,175
next to Keyleth. You glance to your left and look
down and you see what appears to be a child,

3563
03:12:39,175 --> 03:12:51,011
maybe about 13 years old, human-like, though his
ears come to a bit of a finned appearance.

3564
03:12:51,011 --> 03:12:56,138
You can see what looks to be gill slits to the
side of the neck, and he looks up at you with kind

3565
03:12:56,138 --> 03:13:06,332
of a tattered, long-stiffened piece of cloth tunic
and shorts that end at the knee,and he kinda looks

3566
03:13:06,332 --> 03:13:12,197
up at you and just kinda smiles with these very,
very bright, orange-ish yellow eyes,

3567
03:13:12,197 --> 03:13:15,381
"Hi."

3568
03:13:15,381 --> 03:13:23,288
MARISHA: Kaitiaki. And I drop to my knees
and drop down and--

3569
03:13:23,288 --> 03:13:25,842
MATT: (sploosh) You go face-down into the
water.

3570
03:13:25,842 --> 03:13:27,009
MARISHA: Gah! (heavy breathing)

3571
03:13:27,009 --> 03:13:30,662
MATT: Get up and (groans) push the water--
the hair back a bit.

3572
03:13:30,662 --> 03:13:32,812
MARISHA: And bow again.

3573
03:13:32,812 --> 03:13:33,845
LAURA: (laughs)

3574
03:13:33,845 --> 03:13:37,847
MATT: Okay. "Um... what are you doing?"

3575
03:13:37,847 --> 03:13:43,734
MARISHA: Sorry, are you the
leader-- are you the headmaster?

3576
03:13:43,734 --> 03:13:45,676
MATT: "Yes. Yes, I am."

3577
03:13:45,676 --> 03:13:50,027
MARISHA: Oh! Hi. Uh, Keyleth.

3578
03:13:50,027 --> 03:13:52,784
MATT: "Keyleth. " And he reaches out and 
grabs your hand. "Yulan."

3579
03:13:52,784 --> 03:13:54,124
MARISHA: Yulan!

3580
03:13:54,124 --> 03:13:55,647
MATT: "Leader of the Water Ashari."

3581
03:13:55,647 --> 03:13:58,801
SAM: (laughs)

3582
03:13:58,801 --> 03:14:05,397
MARISHA: I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya
and Korren of the Air Ashari,

3583
03:14:05,397 --> 03:14:14,910
and I am here to complete my Aramente.
And I bow again, under the water.

3584
03:14:14,910 --> 03:14:17,019
MATT: (splash) Into the water again.

3585
03:14:17,019 --> 03:14:17,979
MARISHA: (gasps)

3586
03:14:17,979 --> 03:14:21,873
MATT: He shakes his head, you can see now
he has these tossed medium-length dreadlocks that

3587
03:14:21,873 --> 03:14:26,219
shake with his head as he turns side to side,
(laughs) He looks up at the rest of you,

3588
03:14:26,219 --> 03:14:28,517
"So! She yours?"

3589
03:14:28,517 --> 03:14:29,871
LAURA: Mm. Mm-hm.

3590
03:14:29,871 --> 03:14:32,986
TALIESIN: More or less.

3591
03:14:32,986 --> 03:14:34,517
MATT: "You bad people?"

3592
03:14:34,517 --> 03:14:35,522
LAURA: Uh-uh.

3593
03:14:35,522 --> 03:14:36,258
TALIESIN: Nah.

3594
03:14:36,258 --> 03:14:37,232
TRAVIS: Not today.

3595
03:14:37,232 --> 03:14:41,966
SAM: We're just rowing up. What'd I miss?! Start
over, start over! (pants)

3596
03:14:41,966 --> 03:14:43,489
MATT: "Is he a bad person?"

3597
03:14:43,489 --> 03:14:44,382
LAURA: Nah.

3598
03:14:44,382 --> 03:14:45,461
LIAM: Nah. He's all right.

3599
03:14:45,461 --> 03:14:46,754
TALIESIN: He's workable.

3600
03:14:46,754 --> 03:14:50,395
MATT: "Okay. Well, come with me." And he reaches
out and taps you on the shoulder, Keyleth.

3601
03:14:50,395 --> 03:14:55,355
MARISHA: (gasp) It's just such an honor.

3602
03:14:55,355 --> 03:14:56,266
MATT: Come on.

3603
03:14:56,266 --> 03:14:56,932
LAURA: Keyleth!

3604
03:14:56,932 --> 03:14:57,583
MARISHA: What?

3605
03:14:57,583 --> 03:15:00,964
MATT: He grabs your hand and pulls you up out of
the water, and starts running in towards the city,

3606
03:15:00,964 --> 03:15:03,232
holding you behind him. Just kinda tugging you by
the hand.

3607
03:15:03,232 --> 03:15:04,512
LAURA: Oh, he has legs?

3608
03:15:04,512 --> 03:15:05,661
MATT: He does have legs.

3609
03:15:05,661 --> 03:15:06,615
LAURA: Man!

3610
03:15:06,615 --> 03:15:08,251
TALIESIN: And he does know how to use them.

3611
03:15:08,251 --> 03:15:09,069
TRAVIS: Keyleth!

3612
03:15:09,069 --> 03:15:09,731
SAM: (laughs)

3613
03:15:09,731 --> 03:15:10,852
MATT: Splash, splash, splash splash splash
splash...

3614
03:15:10,852 --> 03:15:11,851
TRAVIS: Be cooler.

3615
03:15:11,851 --> 03:15:19,640
MARISHA: Cooler. Cooler. (blows) And I let a
little frost go from my breath.

3616
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:22,475
MATT: (blows) Okay. Splash, splash, splash splash
splash splash splash. He's just running through

3617
03:15:22,475 --> 03:15:27,381
the water. You can see a number of people have now
stepped out of the buildings as you guys approach.

3618
03:15:27,381 --> 03:15:32,928
And each one of them-- all of their clothing ends
at the knee. You can see that this entire society

3619
03:15:32,928 --> 03:15:36,723
walks through and lives partially submerged.

3620
03:15:36,723 --> 03:15:40,505
There is an ever-present water element to their
day to day life.

3621
03:15:40,505 --> 03:15:42,439
LAURA: They must have the pruniest feet!

3622
03:15:42,439 --> 03:15:43,246
MARISHA: -- feet.

3623
03:15:43,246 --> 03:15:44,121
MATT: (laughs)

3624
03:15:44,121 --> 03:15:44,923
MARISHA: I know, right?

3625
03:15:44,923 --> 03:15:45,807
LIAM and MATT: (laughs)

3626
03:15:45,807 --> 03:15:46,772
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

3627
03:15:46,772 --> 03:15:47,961
I would live there in a second!

3628
03:15:47,961 --> 03:15:50,199
TALIESIN: How did that happen just now? How did
you just go there?

3629
03:15:50,199 --> 03:15:50,718
LAURA: (laughs)

3630
03:15:50,718 --> 03:15:53,038
MATT: The sand is soft and still strangely warm
beneath your feet, though the night has come.

3631
03:15:53,038 --> 03:15:57,985
And even through the distant sparkles of light
everywhere, this city--

3632
03:15:57,985 --> 03:16:02,009
a lot of the buildings seem hollow and open,
like what walls that there are, there's large

3633
03:16:02,009 --> 03:16:07,436
windows. It seems like everything has this very
kind of open-air, free lifestyle to it.

3634
03:16:07,436 --> 03:16:09,351
And as you begin to approach--

3635
03:16:09,351 --> 03:16:14,257
MARISHA: As he's dragging me, I just start, like,
rambling all the questions at once. I'm like,

3636
03:16:14,318 --> 03:16:20,781
Aren't-- This is such a gorgeous city you have.
Are you freshwater or saltwater? Do you have

3637
03:16:20,781 --> 03:16:26,047
webbed feet? Does everyone have webbed feet? How
many people can control water? Wow, look at that.

3638
03:16:26,047 --> 03:16:28,736
Look at those. Is this fire that you use? Or is
it all arcane?

3639
03:16:28,736 --> 03:16:33,488
MATT: He's not answering any of your questions,
and you hear a voice shout out: "Yulan!"

3640
03:16:33,488 --> 03:16:34,390
MARISHA: (gasps)

3641
03:16:34,390 --> 03:16:38,427
MATT: And the boy kinda stops and drops your hand
and backs away with his hands kinda crossed behind

3642
03:16:38,427 --> 03:16:43,430
his back, and he steps away, bowing his head a
little bit and (splashing noise) away. The crowd--

3643
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:48,366
and you can now see, all these different people,
most of them appear to be human, elven,

3644
03:16:48,366 --> 03:16:53,101
there are a handful of dwarves, a couple
halflings, it's a spread of races here. You see

3645
03:16:53,101 --> 03:16:57,822
two half-orcs that have these large tridents off
to the side, and they're guarded but they're all

3646
03:16:57,822 --> 03:17:06,817
deciding whether or not this is a welcoming
circumstance, or a careful parlay. The voice that

3647
03:17:06,817 --> 03:17:11,676
rang out, the crowd parts a little bit, and you
watch as the water around you guys begins to

3648
03:17:11,676 --> 03:17:20,285
spiral into these columns. Each one appears to be
similar to the entity you saw rise onto the ship.

3649
03:17:20,285 --> 03:17:24,810
A series of water elementals begin to rise out of
the water, as some of the individuals in the crowd

3650
03:17:24,810 --> 03:17:31,137
pull their hands together, and then you see four
of them rise and begin to circle. Not closing in,

3651
03:17:31,137 --> 03:17:36,736
but just keeping very close vigil around.
And you realize at this point that, while the

3652
03:17:36,736 --> 03:17:43,541
city is welcoming, they are also a carefully
guarded people. The crowd parts, and you see

3653
03:17:43,626 --> 03:17:51,904
stepping out, with the tiniest of splashes,
a very tiny woman. Old, shriveled, most of her

3654
03:17:51,904 --> 03:17:58,863
hair is gone and these thin wisps of white and
gray, a wide oval-like head, the skin itself an

3655
03:17:58,863 --> 03:18:03,359
olive yellow tint. Very wrinkled and pruny,
the eyes are almost these tiny little black

3656
03:18:03,544 --> 03:18:13,702
beads. Gnome, very old, with a long staff that's
twice her height that just kinda with each step

3657
03:18:13,702 --> 03:18:18,192
(squishing splash) kinda like a weird female Water
Ashari Yoda.

3658
03:18:18,192 --> 03:18:20,335
And just kinda steps forward through the water--

3659
03:18:20,335 --> 03:18:21,944
MARISHA: Rad!

3660
03:18:21,944 --> 03:18:33,585
MATT: "Yulan, you are not to greet our guests! Now,
you. What is your name?"

3661
03:18:33,585 --> 03:18:46,047
MARISHA: Hi. (clears throat) Kaitiaki, I am
Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air

3662
03:18:46,047 --> 03:18:50,227
Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente.
I am--

3663
03:18:50,227 --> 03:18:52,845
MATT: "Kaitiaki."

3664
03:18:52,845 --> 03:19:00,163
MARISHA: Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your
presence.

3665
03:19:00,163 --> 03:19:12,901
MATT: "I am Uvenda, Heart of the Tides here.
I had my own Aramente, long ago. And I knew your

3666
03:19:12,901 --> 03:19:17,166
"mother who came for her Aramente, as well."

3667
03:19:17,166 --> 03:19:18,943
MARISHA: You knew my mother?

3668
03:19:18,943 --> 03:19:23,306
MATT: "She came here for her own Aramente.

3669
03:19:23,306 --> 03:19:26,797
"And now you come to complete what she could not.
So--"

3670
03:19:26,869 --> 03:19:28,099
MARISHA: I'm-- I'm--

3671
03:19:28,099 --> 03:19:31,052
MATT: "-- you are welcome, Keyleth of the
Zephra."

3672
03:19:31,052 --> 03:19:47,861
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm-- sorry, that just means
she visited the Earth, and the Fire, and the Water

3673
03:19:47,861 --> 03:19:52,390
Ashari. She completed her Aramente.

3674
03:19:52,390 --> 03:19:55,286
MATT: "She did not, child."

3675
03:19:55,286 --> 03:20:03,348
MARISHA: What hap-- She-- I-- Everywhere I've
been, she's been. Why not?

3676
03:20:03,348 --> 03:20:08,360
MATT: "Come. Come. We shall speak, there is much
to discuss, and it is growing cold out here,

3677
03:20:08,360 --> 03:20:20,966
"and you could probably all use a warm fire.
So? See to our guests!" And the folks around go

3678
03:20:20,966 --> 03:20:26,800
from their tense reverie and begin to approach and
take, like just instinctually taking your

3679
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:32,866
belongings, and helping you unload. You guys
(laughs) withdraw, and they back off as soon as

3680
03:20:32,866 --> 03:20:40,490
they realize that wasn't part of the circumstance.
But you are led deeper into this city, and there

3681
03:20:40,490 --> 03:20:46,841
is a central temple that has multi-layers.
Three floors with a number of spiral staircases

3682
03:20:46,841 --> 03:20:51,128
on the outside of the structure that lead to it.
Each floor is still very open and you get the

3683
03:20:51,202 --> 03:21:01,770
sense that this whole city is built around the
flow of ocean air and sea spray. And there is

3684
03:21:01,770 --> 03:21:08,025
almost like a constant breeze that just blows
through. And a lot of the buildings are rounded at

3685
03:21:08,025 --> 03:21:14,315
the edges. The heavy waves and water that just
come through here has-- you can see rounded and

3686
03:21:14,315 --> 03:21:18,689
brought curvature to all the structures for as
long as the city's been around. There are elements

3687
03:21:18,753 --> 03:21:24,931
of shell-type shapes, there are bits of ocean
inspiration to the architecture, it's a very

3688
03:21:24,931 --> 03:21:29,390
interesting, alien, and beautiful place compared
to where you've been before. You're led into this

3689
03:21:29,390 --> 03:21:34,763
temple structure in the center of this city,
you're brought to a series of what look almost

3690
03:21:34,763 --> 03:21:45,552
like tree stumps, but they're made of a bright,
bleached white, almost spongy material.

3691
03:21:45,552 --> 03:21:53,149
And as you sit on them, food is brought to you,
fish, fresh cooked platters. You guys are now

3692
03:21:53,149 --> 03:22:00,109
being treated like honored guests, as you arrive.
As you sit down, Keyleth, Uvenda, has a servant

3693
03:22:00,109 --> 03:22:06,710
bring a much taller sponged stool than the ones
you guys have, and it's set in front of you,

3694
03:22:06,710 --> 03:22:12,125
and she uses her staff and (grunts) pole-vaults
on top of it, and sits, crosses her legs,

3695
03:22:12,125 --> 03:22:16,721
and sets the staff off to somebody and kinda
leans down with her hands in front, her chin

3696
03:22:16,721 --> 03:22:22,193
resting on them, her little beady gnomish eyes
looking down at you.

3697
03:22:22,193 --> 03:22:30,243
"So, Keyleth, the Aramente is not easy."

3698
03:22:30,243 --> 03:22:31,595
MARISHA: I know.

3699
03:22:31,595 --> 03:22:36,962
MATT: "Do you know what this leg of your journey
entails?"

3700
03:22:36,962 --> 03:22:45,829
MARISHA: I mean, I've made it this far. In my
heart, I feel like I'm almost complete, but I feel

3701
03:22:45,829 --> 03:22:49,329
like you're about to tell me something different.

3702
03:22:49,329 --> 03:22:56,771
MATT: "You are near the completion of the
Aramente, this is true, and through this,

3703
03:22:56,771 --> 03:23:07,448
"you will learn the strength of utilizing your own
capabilities and those of your trusted allies.

3704
03:23:07,448 --> 03:23:14,888
"You will learn various ways of looking at the
difficulties and challenges that are before you.

3705
03:23:14,888 --> 03:23:22,069
"And there are lessons as part of this, so listen
carefully. For the final leg of your Aramente,

3706
03:23:22,069 --> 03:23:26,259
"we will wait 'til the morning sun comes to these
waters,

3707
03:23:26,259 --> 03:23:35,516
"you and your compatriots will be brought down
below the waves, below this city, to the Aerie of

3708
03:23:35,516 --> 03:23:44,829
"Torrent, where the Vesrah rift resides to the
Water Elemental Plane. The Aerie is where we

3709
03:23:44,829 --> 03:23:54,122
"implant the lodestones that keep the village from
sinking, and the rift size contained. The

3710
03:23:54,122 --> 03:24:02,029
"lodestones, unfortunately, do wane in power over
time, so we must occasionally cross into the rift,

3711
03:24:02,029 --> 03:24:08,356
"and have our fastest Waverunners recover
replacements within the Elemental Plane.

3712
03:24:08,431 --> 03:24:15,486
"The source of the lodestones, in which we
have built and maintained this city. But

3713
03:24:15,486 --> 03:24:24,346
"the once-challenging path to these lodestones has
now become deadly for all but our swiftest."

3714
03:24:24,346 --> 03:24:26,122
MARISHA: Why?

3715
03:24:26,122 --> 03:24:29,553
MATT: "We would find these stones sparsely
scattered throughout the plane, just beyond the

3716
03:24:29,553 --> 03:24:34,713
"rift, leaving us uncertain of their origin for as
long as we've been here. For generations,

3717
03:24:34,713 --> 03:24:43,049
"they would just fall and sink to the bottom,
or we'd scavenge them from the silt and sand

3718
03:24:43,049 --> 03:24:56,409
"below. However, this last generation of 
Waverunners have discovered them to be a product.

3719
03:24:56,480 --> 03:25:07,334
"Natural waste of a particular creature that
resides within the boundless oceans of the plane.

3720

"An ancient beast, once guided upon creation by
the Titans that claimed this world their own

3721
03:25:15,844 --> 03:25:22,845
"before the gods came and gave light to our
souls."

3722
03:25:22,845 --> 03:25:25,679
MARISHA: What's it called?

3723
03:25:25,679 --> 03:25:29,038
MATT: "They are known in many languages,
by many names,

3724
03:25:29,038 --> 03:25:31,626
"but the common tongue knows to them as 
the krakens."

03:25:31,626 --> 03:25:32,598
LAURA: (yells)

3726

MARISHA: (yells)

SAM: (scared panting)

TRAVIS: (excited hyperventilation)

3729
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:42,674
MATT: "Humongous, tentacled beasts, long free of
their servitude from their creators. One of these

3730

"such krakens has taken to the waters near the
rift, and made it its home on the other side.

"And this beast appears to have been producing the
lodestones that we relied on for ages. This

"creatures naturally drawn to the energy of the
tear between the worlds. We now use the lodestones

MARISHA: So--

3738

MATT: She puts a finger out to stop you.
"--would be to descend into this Aerie of

these lodestones, and return to us. That is all.

"Avoid the beast if possible, for to battle it is
folly, and to kill it is to sink our city,

3741
03:26:55,664 --> 03:26:58,721
"and curse the rift, to eventually fade."

3742
03:26:58,721 --> 03:27:01,454
MARISHA: So, don't kill it?

3743
03:27:01,454 --> 03:27:03,735
LAURA: Do. Not. Kill. Got it.

3744
03:27:03,735 --> 03:27:08,882
MARISHA: Don't kill the kraken. Right? Don't kill
the kraken?

3745
03:27:08,882 --> 03:27:10,464
TRAVIS: No, kill the kraken.

3746
03:27:10,464 --> 03:27:11,354
LAURA: (laughs)

3747
03:27:11,354 --> 03:27:12,778
LIAM: Get kraken.

3748
03:27:12,778 --> 03:27:14,480
SAM: We can reason with it.

3749
03:27:14,480 --> 03:27:20,210
MARISHA: Get three lodestones, bring it back,
don't kill him because he is responsible for you

LAURA: Because he makes the lodestones.

SAM: With his poop?

3753

LIAM: Poopstones.

3754
03:27:26,148 --> 03:27:27,914
MARISHA: He makes the lodestones--

LAURA: Basically.

3756
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:30,053
SAM: Poops lodestones.

03:27:30,734 --> 03:27:31,947
MATT: "Essentially, yes."

3759
03:27:31,947 --> 03:27:32,687
(all laugh)

3760
03:27:32,687 --> 03:27:34,422
MARISHA: All right.

3761
03:27:34,422 --> 03:27:36,614
MATT: "To use such base terms."

3762
03:27:36,614 --> 03:27:46,363
MARISHA: All right. So he drops these lodestones
at the base of the water plane.

3763
03:27:46,363 --> 03:27:54,300
MATT: "Yes. Often found within the vicinity of the
rift, but such is the beast. Be quick, be careful,

3764
03:27:54,300 --> 03:27:57,857
"be stealthy, and return as soon as you have
them."

3765
03:27:57,857 --> 03:28:00,110
MARISHA: Do you have an example of these
lodestones

3766
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:01,747
so that we know what we're looking
for?

3767
03:28:01,747 --> 03:28:03,845
MATT: "We will show you at the Aerie tomorrow in
the morning."

3768
03:28:03,845 --> 03:28:07,919
MARISHA: All right. So this starts in the morn--
Which is exactly what you said.

3769
03:28:07,919 --> 03:28:09,988
You totally said that, didn't you?

3770
03:28:09,988 --> 03:28:11,271
MATT: "Yes. Yes, I have."

3771
03:28:11,271 --> 03:28:12,663
MARISHA: All right.

3772
03:28:12,663 --> 03:28:17,998
LAURA: Is there something that helps those of us
who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater?

3773
03:28:17,998 --> 03:28:19,295
MARISHA: I can handle that.

3774
03:28:19,295 --> 03:28:19,965
LAURA: Yes?

3775
03:28:19,965 --> 03:28:28,689
MARISHA: I can handle that. So. What happened to
my mother?

3776
03:28:28,689 --> 03:28:38,349
MATT: She swallows strongly. "Your mother was a
brave woman, very much like you, now that I see

3777
03:28:38,349 --> 03:28:50,605
"you before me. Unsure of herself, and wishing to
please, and not disappoint. And it's hard to

3778
03:28:50,605 --> 03:29:02,787
"ascertain but I fear it's perhaps that lack of
confidence that may have caused her failure."

3779
03:29:02,850 --> 03:29:05,220
MARISHA: Did she not make it out? Of the water
plane?

3780
03:29:05,220 --> 03:29:12,284
MATT: "She brought her own companions, that she
had found and brought with her along her path.

3781
03:29:12,284 --> 03:29:25,796
"Our guides brought her to the rift, and her
companions did not survive. Your mother did not

3782
03:29:25,796 --> 03:29:37,504
"return, and we sent scouts to try and retrieve her
body so she could be interred correctly,

3783
03:29:37,504 --> 03:29:44,141
"but we only found a leg."

3784
03:29:44,141 --> 03:29:53,471
MARISHA: She's still alive. That means she's still
alive.

3785
03:29:53,471 --> 03:30:02,839
MATT: "Hold onto that hope. Use it, and finish
what she started. She lives through you at the

3786
03:30:02,839 --> 03:30:14,409
"very least. Hold that memory."

3787
03:30:14,409 --> 03:30:25,541
MARISHA: I will hold on to it, but I hope you know
that does not define me. I'm not her.

3788
03:30:25,541 --> 03:30:36,357
MATT: "Good. Then perhaps you have a chance."

3789
03:30:36,357 --> 03:30:47,464
MARISHA: We'll complete your task. Thank you.

3790
03:30:47,464 --> 03:30:56,732
MATT: "You've come far, young Keyleth. I have
faith that you will rise, and become the Voice of

3791
03:30:56,732 --> 03:31:11,283
"the Tempest. For now, we rest. Eat. Sleep.
For tomorrow, you face the pet of the Titans."

3792
03:31:11,283 --> 03:31:12,697
And that's where we'll leave tonight's session.

3793
03:31:12,697 --> 03:31:13,447
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3794
03:31:13,447 --> 03:31:14,351
SAM: (scared panting)

3795
03:31:14,351 --> 03:31:15,351
TRAVIS: We're gonna kill a kraken!

3796
03:31:15,351 --> 03:31:16,165
MARISHA, LIAM, and LAURA: No!

3797
03:31:16,165 --> 03:31:17,059
MARISHA: Kill a kraken!

3798
03:31:17,059 --> 03:31:17,930
SAM: No, don't kill a kraken.

3799
03:31:17,930 --> 03:31:18,888
MARISHA: Right, we're not gonna kill a kraken.

3800
03:31:18,888 --> 03:31:19,635
MATT: (laughs)

3801
03:31:19,635 --> 03:31:20,790
MARISHA: We are going to not kill it.

3802
03:31:20,790 --> 03:31:21,983
TALIESIN: We are going to irritate a kraken.

3803
03:31:21,983 --> 03:31:23,533
LAURA: We are going to--

3804
03:31:23,533 --> 03:31:24,259
TALIESIN: We are going to make it--

3805
03:31:24,259 --> 03:31:25,059
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

3806
03:31:25,059 --> 03:31:26,555
LAURA: -- We're going to steal some kraken's
poop.

3807
03:31:26,555 --> 03:31:28,018
TRAVIS: I have no idea what that means.

3808
03:31:28,018 --> 03:31:29,420
MARISHA: We're gonna collect kraken droppings.

3809
03:31:29,420 --> 03:31:31,328
TRAVIS: I don't know what a kraken is like in
D&amp;D, but I'm fucking stoked to find out.

3810
03:31:31,328 --> 03:31:32,635
TALIESIN: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.

3811
03:31:32,635 --> 03:31:34,186
MARISHA: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.

3812
03:31:34,186 --> 03:31:35,237
LAURA: (laughs)

3813
03:31:35,237 --> 03:31:37,422
MARISHA: Oh, I'm so gonna bring a bottle of Kraken
next game!

3814
03:31:37,422 --> 03:31:38,109
MATT: Yeah!

3815
03:31:38,109 --> 03:31:39,129
LAURA: (excited shouting)

3816
03:31:39,129 --> 03:31:40,407
TALIESIN: You know what else we're gonna do? We're
not gonna finish it.

3817
03:31:40,407 --> 03:31:41,359
MARISHA: We're not gonna finish it.

3818
03:31:41,359 --> 03:31:42,133
MATT: (laughs)

3819
03:31:42,133 --> 03:31:43,103
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not gonna finish it.

3820
03:31:43,103 --> 03:31:44,098
MARISHA: That's game, we do not finish it.

3821
03:31:44,098 --> 03:31:44,773
MATT: That's kind of perfect.

3822
03:31:44,773 --> 03:31:45,604
LAURA: We're gonna drink most of it.

3823
03:31:45,604 --> 03:31:46,293
LIAM: (chuckles)

3824
03:31:46,293 --> 03:31:47,745
TALIESIN: We're gonna drink most of it, but we're
not gonna kill the kraken.

3825
03:31:47,745 --> 03:31:48,679
MARISHA: Except for like one-fourth of it.

3826
03:31:48,679 --> 03:31:49,481
LAURA: Yeah.

3827
03:31:49,481 --> 03:31:50,546
TALIESIN. Don't. 'Cause we don't kill the kraken.

3828
03:31:50,546 --> 03:31:51,298
MARISHA: We let it live.

3829
03:31:51,298 --> 03:31:52,583
LIAM: We're gonna give that thing some maylox.
(proot fart sound)

3830
03:31:52,583 --> 03:31:53,237
TALIESIN: Don't kill the kraken.

3831
03:31:53,237 --> 03:31:53,829
TRAVIS: Nice job, Matt!

3832
03:31:53,829 --> 03:31:54,621
MATT: Nice job, you guys.

3833
03:31:54,621 --> 03:31:55,280
TRAVIS: Nice C!

3834
03:31:55,280 --> 03:31:56,095
TALIESIN: Good game. Good game.

3835
03:31:56,095 --> 03:31:56,775
LAURA: C!

3836
03:31:56,775 --> 03:32:01,130
MATT: All right. We'll bring this up next week on
Thursday for the last leg of Keyleth's Aramente--

3837
03:32:01,130 --> 03:32:01,535
SAM: Hey.

3838
03:32:01,535 --> 03:32:03,475
MATT: -- as the party might face a kraken!

3839
03:32:03,475 --> 03:32:04,898
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

3840
03:32:04,959 --> 03:32:05,828
MATT: That'll be interesting.

3841
03:32:05,828 --> 03:32:07,107
LIAM: One of 17.

3842
03:32:07,107 --> 03:32:07,949
MATT: (laughs)

3843
03:32:07,949 --> 03:32:09,865
TRAVIS: Yo momma is the kraken.

3844
03:32:09,927 --> 03:32:11,537
MARISHA: That's what I'm most afraid of!

3845
03:32:11,537 --> 03:32:12,886
LAURA: Oh my god!

3846
03:32:12,886 --> 03:32:14,021
MARISHA: I've already thought about it.

3847
03:32:14,021 --> 03:32:15,133
TALIESIN: Long John Silver!

3848
03:32:15,133 --> 03:32:16,144
TRAVIS: Wow. No, no, no, no.

3849
03:32:16,144 --> 03:32:18,268
MARISHA: That she's the full Long John Silver.

3850
03:32:18,268 --> 03:32:20,808
TALIESIN: She's gonna go pirate, she's gonna have
a patch and a beard--

3851
03:32:20,808 --> 03:32:21,624
MARISHA: And a peg leg!

3852
03:32:21,624 --> 03:32:22,590
TALIESIN: -- and a peg leg.

3853
03:32:22,590 --> 03:32:23,540
MARISHA: She totally has a peg leg.

3854
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:24,398
LAURA: Ew.

3855
03:32:24,398 --> 03:32:26,525
TALIESIN: And like a little cuttlefish instead of
a instead of a parrot.

3856
03:32:26,525 --> 03:32:27,256
MARISHA: (gasps)

3857
03:32:27,256 --> 03:32:27,948
LAURA: Rad!

3858
03:32:27,948 --> 03:32:28,910
MARISHA: My mom's a pirate!

3859
03:32:28,910 --> 03:32:29,509
LAURA: Definitely.

3860
03:32:29,509 --> 03:32:30,323
LIAM: (singing)

3861
03:32:30,323 --> 03:32:31,418
TALIESIN: (joins singing)

3862
03:32:31,418 --> 03:32:32,536
MARISHA: (joins singing)

3863
03:32:32,536 --> 03:32:34,162
SAM: That is not the key at all.

3864
03:32:34,162 --> 03:32:34,967
TRAVIS: Oh god, get us out of here.

3865
03:32:34,967 --> 03:32:35,775
TALIESIN: No.

3866
03:32:35,775 --> 03:32:36,452
MATT: All righty, guys.

3867
03:32:36,452 --> 03:32:37,259
(all laugh)

3868
03:32:37,259 --> 03:32:40,399
MATT: We'll pick up next week on Thursday.
(laughs) Thank you so much for watching.

3869
03:32:40,399 --> 03:32:43,466
Thank you again, Tor Books, for sponsoring.

3870
03:32:43,466 --> 03:32:45,100
SAM: (incoherent background noise) Tor Books,
toy boats, Tor Books.

3871
03:32:45,100 --> 03:32:46,084
LIAM: Tor Books.

3872
03:32:46,084 --> 03:32:48,836
MATT: Wyrmwood for being awesome. We're gonna go
ahead and rest. Oh, I forgot to mention.

3873
03:32:48,836 --> 03:32:56,333
I will be on the Rollplay live anniversary game
on Saturday. I'm actually flying up to Canada to

3874
03:32:56,333 --> 03:32:58,047
go play with them in person. So--

3875
03:32:58,047 --> 03:32:59,411
(all cheer)

3876
03:32:59,411 --> 03:33:02,713
MATT: I'm gonna be jumping in for one episode of
the Swan Song series.

3877
03:33:02,713 --> 03:33:03,820
TRAVIS: Are you gonna play?

3878
03:33:03,820 --> 03:33:05,064
MATT: That will be fun. Yeah! I get to play!

3879
03:33:05,064 --> 03:33:06,145
SAM and LIAM: In Canada?

3880
03:33:06,145 --> 03:33:07,154
MATT: Up in Canada, yeah.

3881
03:33:07,154 --> 03:33:09,674
SAM: Each d20 is actually worth 22 up there.

3882
03:33:09,674 --> 03:33:12,700
(all laugh)

3883
03:33:12,700 --> 03:33:14,233
TALIESIN: Is that where you have to roll
backwards?

3884
03:33:14,233 --> 03:33:15,035
SAM: Yeah.

3885
03:33:15,035 --> 03:33:16,160
TALIESIN: You roll backwards there?

3886
03:33:16,160 --> 03:33:16,942
MATT: Yeah, that's how it works.

3887
03:33:16,942 --> 03:33:19,449
MARISHA: And, as always, don't forget to watch
Talks Machina on Tuesday--

3888
03:33:19,449 --> 03:33:20,026
LAURA: On Tuesday!

3889
03:33:20,026 --> 03:33:21,111
MATT: With Brian.

3890
03:33:21,111 --> 03:33:22,680
MARISHA: With Brian Foster!

3891
03:33:22,680 --> 03:33:23,547
MATT: That will be fun.

3892
03:33:23,547 --> 03:33:24,602
MARISHA: At 7pm.

3893
03:33:24,602 --> 03:33:27,907
LIAM: Matt's always talking about his campaign up
in Canada, I'm not sure if it's real or not.

3894
03:33:27,907 --> 03:33:30,478
(all laugh)

3895
03:33:30,478 --> 03:33:31,429
MARISHA: What are you talking about, guys?

3896
03:33:31,429 --> 03:33:32,199
MATT: It is real!

3897
03:33:32,199 --> 03:33:33,022
MARISHA: This is fine.

3898
03:33:33,022 --> 03:33:33,807
MATT: It's real!

3899
03:33:33,807 --> 03:33:34,402
LAURA: Totally real.

3900
03:33:34,402 --> 03:33:35,540
MARISHA: This is great!

3901
03:33:35,540 --> 03:33:38,204
MATT: Anyway. Have a wonderful night, guys.
Rest well. Laura, get up early.

3902
03:33:38,204 --> 03:33:38,964
LAURA: I know!

3903
03:33:38,964 --> 03:33:42,002
MATT: I'm sorry. Is it Thursday yet?
