SAM: Are we in sync?

3
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:10,184
MATT: Hopefully. There it is. Okay. Anyway,
welcome back! Thank you again for your patience,

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:13,998
we're going to kick into this really fast.
However, back to the matter at hand, we are

5
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:16,443
sponsored tonight by Marvel Puzzle Quest. Sam,
once again please.

6
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:20,011
SAM: Once again, I hope people can hear. Marvel
Puzzle Quest is an awesomely addictive role

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:24,041
playing puzzle game where Marvel's fearless
superheroes come to life! You can download it now

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:30,901

Store, and the Steam. And now, a rare 5-star

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:36,752
Spider-man has arrived in Marvel Puzzle Quest just
in time for Spider-man: Homecoming, the movie. You

10
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:42,294

11
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:48,393

team. Now, to celebrate the awesomeness that is

12
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:52,797
Marvel Puzzle Quest, I have another one of my
famous puzzles for Taliesin.

13
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,143
TALIESIN: All right! Bring it!

14
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:59,656
SAM: Which of the following is an actual enemy
from the game Marvel Puzzle Quest, and which is

15
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:03,455
the name of an actual movie starring Jean-Claude
Van Damme.

16
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:07,385
TALIESIN: Oh no. I am genuinely in trouble!

17
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:08,665
SAM: Hitman!

18
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:10,876
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's a DC character.

19
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,111
SAM: That's an enemy. Brawler!

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,139
TALIESIN: That's a Jean-Claude Van Damme.

21
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:17,374
SAM: No. Timecop!

SAM: Century Fighter!

25
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:24,634
TALIESIN: That's--

26
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:26,496
MATT: What is it, Taliesin?

27
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:29,186
TALIESIN: I don't know! JCVD! This is so painful.

28
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,521
SAM: Game enemy.

29
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,941

35
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:41,240

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,618
SAM: That is also a Jean-Claude Van Damme. I'll
skip a couple of these. Okay. Defender!

37
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:49,834
TALIESIN: That is a--

38
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,473

TALIESIN: The only Jean-Claude Van Damme film I've
seen.

45
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:12,446
SAM: Okay. And one more for bonus. Killing
Machine. That's a trick; it's a Dolph Lundgren

46
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,672
movie.

47
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:17,416
TALIESIN: I have never been so baffled in my life!
That was amazing!

48
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,411
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest! Marvel Puzzle Quest.

a few, just stuff. So, you know the David Mack

53
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:45,105
poster? It looks like some people have requested,
so the poster-- not the signed one! But the

54
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:50,238
unsigned one is going to be for sale for a few
days extra, so there's that, that's happening.

55
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,477
SAM: Hey, that's good news!

56
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:56,304
LAURA: That's good news. Also good news is that
some stuff is out of stock in the store, but all

59
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,856
SAM: Laura, is something wrong with your head?

60
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:11,387
LAURA: And! Actually, I think that's about it.
There's still like, the shirts. Some sizes are

over a three-month span.

64
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,268
TALIESIN: I'm blaming the shirt, man.

65
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:29,560

131
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,426
Weyland-Yutani vessel and if we fart out it's
because we've been eaten by xenomorphs. Sorry.

132
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:50,918
SAM: Can't hear Ashley at all. Liam is totally
overpowering. I love it

confronted the Whispered One, the Undying King

145
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:14,797
Vecna, in the Shadowfell. The battle did not go in
your favor, with the death and very faint recovery

146
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:22,904
of Vex, and the disintegration of Vax during this
confrontation. Realizing that it was not going in

147
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:28,077
your favor, you Plane Shifted to the Feywild,
where you began to come up with some sort of plot

148
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:32,645
or plan to try and bring your friend, Vax, back
without a body. During this time Vax had a

149
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:37,855
conversation with his patron, the Raven Queen, and
was given an offer where he could return along

150
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:44,986
with powers that would aid in this coming final
confrontation. However, the deal came with some

151
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:50,716
drawbacks, and upon his friends awakening the next
morning in the Feywild, they found Vax returned to

152
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:57,976
them, whole. Seemingly alive, returned, though
missing his equipment. Equipment returned, and a

153
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:04,214
brief period of figuring out what possibly
delivered their friend back to this space. It was

154
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:10,388
decided that based on his experience with his
patron that the powers beyond the Divine

155
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:17,631
Gate-- the Prime Gods that lay claim to the divine
beyond the Prime Material plane will probably be

156
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,160
the next best bet in gaining some sort of power,
information about how to better prepare for the

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,728
coming struggle with Vecna, the Whispered One.

158
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:30,666
You then made your way to Vasselheim, where Pike
went to her temple of Sarenrae which she had

159
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:36,571
helped raise and reconstruct, and had a vision
from her patron deity asking her to come visit her

160
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:45,663
at the Island of Renewal, and was granted, through
this vision, an object that would link, via your spell,

161
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:52,349
a way to traverse past the Divine Gate and
directly to her location on the plane of Elysium.

162
00:11:52,349 --> 00:12:00,510
Also, Grog and Scanlan had a little excursion in
the city of Vasselheim and a minor altercation

163
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,555
with the guards, which led to a larger altercation
with the guards, which led to a much larger

164
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:08,257
altercation with the guards, which led to them
barely escaping and deciding it's time to go.

165
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,270
TRAVIS: We can't go back.

166
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,971
MARISHA: Vasselheim's most wanted?

167
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:20,684
MATT: Yeah. You guys then clasped hands, and using
the Plane Shift spell found yourselves stepping

168
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:27,841
down on the crunching sand-like shores of the
Island of Renewal. There looking past the clusters

169
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:34,795
of stone and trees that mark the perimeter of this
interesting, beautiful, strange distant landscape.

170
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:42,492
You can see beyond the tree line and the hills
that jut up from the floor the crystalline

171
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:47,403
structure that seems to mark the center of the
Island, and that is where we left off. What would

172
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,240
you guys like to do?

173
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,426
LAURA: Did you say the sand is made of pearls?

174
00:12:53,426 --> 00:13:00,712
MATT: It appears to be, yeah. The granules of the
sand are too big to be tiny sand granules, they're

175
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:07,523
about pearl-size, maybe a little bit smaller. And
they're smooth, and they seem to reflect the light

176
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:08,902
in a very beautiful way.

177
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,242
LAURA: I just want to take a handful and look at
them.

178
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,986
ASHLEY: Oh, can we make a body scrub?

179
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:19,782
LAURA: Good idea, Pike. I'm going to take a good
handful and put it in a pouch and save them.

180
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,144
SAM: Microdermabrasion.

181
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:27,724
LAURA: They're micro-plastic beads that have
washed up on the shore.

182
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,474
ASHLEY: I'm going to take a little bit, too.

183
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:38,232
MATT: Okay, so you gather up some of these
pearlescent beads of some kind and fill a small

184
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:43,424
pouch of them and put it amongst the rest of your
belongings. All righty, anything else you guys

185
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,385
wish to do to prepare? What do you want to do?

186
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,685
SAM: Oh god. We're going to go see Sarenrae,
right?

187
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:52,226
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, like one does. Fucking
jauntily walk up.

188
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:56,468
LIAM: (distorted) And you said that that tower was
full of some sort of flame, right?

189
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,055
SAM: Sorry, robot Liam!

190
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:05,275
MARISHA: No, I wanted two cheeseburgers. What did
you say?

191
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,217
LIAM: (in speak-and-spell voice) I am richer for
having known you.

192
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:09,344
TRAVIS: Thank you!  Much better!

193
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:10,993
MATT: What did you say?

194
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:17,368
LIAM: I said (robot noises). You said that that
tower had, was full of some sort of flame, right?

195
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:22,814
MATT: Yes, and the, what little you can see, it
seems to form this torso of a feminine structure,

196
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:29,581
the body of which gives out these wings that curl
upward. Held amongst the center of these wings is

197
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:36,769
a large, gem-like flame. And you see within the
actual crystalline-- we'll call it like a palace,

198
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,837
if you will-- it looks like there's a light source
within that flickers and dances like an eternal

199
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:45,710
bonfire or flame, and it seems to have a pulse to
it.

200
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,321
LIAM: I'm sure this is unnecessary, but I'm
going to start thinking about setting the Death

201
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:55,018
Walker's Ward to fire damage.

202
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:58,355
MATT: Okay, so you guys want to take a short rest
to do so?

203
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,152
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

204
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:01,990
MARISHA: Do we need a short rest?

205
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,574
LIAM: It's a 20-minute thing. Well, I don't have
to, if everyone else wants to start.

206
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:10,263
SAM: We're not in a rush, right? 20 minutes won't
kill us.

207
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,100
LAURA: I guess. Sure.

208
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,804
MATT: Okay. So you take the better part of an
hour, half an hour or so, 40 minutes or so, for a

209
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:23,608
short rest to reset your armor to fire resist. Any
other preparations?

210
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:33,972
SAM: Yeah, well hey. I'm no expert on the
religious arts, but we have this eye of doom with

211
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:39,584
us. Should we really be bringing this into a holy
place of goodness?

212
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,145
LAURA: I don't know.

213
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,703
TALIESIN: I think, if anything, it might be even
less effective here.

214
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:50,596
SAM: But what if it knows where we are and can
somehow get an advantage and kill Sarenrae or

215
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,020
something? I don't know.

216
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,443
LAURA: I feel like we should definitely ask
Sarenrae about it. But it's a little late to get

217
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,900
rid of it now.

218
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,566
TALIESIN: Other than your pocket dimension.

219
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:00,961
MARISHA: It's in the Bag of Holding, right?

220
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,965
TRAVIS: Nope.

221
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:05,536
ASHLEY: I have it. I have the eyeball in the box.

222
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,135
SAM: Is it still in the box? Can you shake the box
and make sure there's something still in there?

223
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,364
LAURA: Don't open the box!

224
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:11,131
SAM: Don't open the box! Just shake it.

225
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:16,183
LAURA: Does it feel like there's an eyeball if you
shake it? Just shake it and feel. Does it shake

226
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,317
around?

227
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:25,659
MATT: (rattling noise) It does rattle a little
bit. Like a peeled wet grape, you hear it sloshing

228
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,892
around inside.

229
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:29,075
ASHLEY: (laughs) Ew.

230
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,371
TALIESIN: Best Halloween trick ever.

231
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:35,738
TRAVIS: Can you crush the tiny granules on the
ground in between your fingers, if you try really

232
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:36,780
hard?

233
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,796
MATT: Do you try?

234
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,216
TRAVIS: Yeah, I try real hard.

235
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:43,859
MATT: Okay, you pick one up, and you (grunts)
push. Make a strength check.

236
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:47,316
TRAVIS: 23.

237
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:50,445
MATT: (grunts and strains) No.

238
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:54,305
LAURA: Whoa! They're titanium pearls!

239
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,207
MARISHA: It would be good for microdermabrasion!

240
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,294
LAURA: It really would. Wow.

241
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:05,969
ASHLEY: Could I put my hand in the water? Just a
(doot).

242
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:11,933
MATT: You step back a bit to where the shore is.
The water is gently brushing against the shore and

243
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:16,102
then pulls back. There's no heavy waves. The
current is this steady, almost relaxing,

244
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:25,316
undulating sound. This (steady whoosh). You reach
over and place your hand within, and you feel the

245
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:32,660
water soak into the inside of the plates of your
gauntlet. It's warm. It's probably the equivalent

246
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:39,434
of a good 75, 80 degrees. It would be wonderful
beach water.

247
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:49,439
ASHLEY: Okay. Guys, it feels so nice. Should we go
for just a little bit of a swim while he attunes

248
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,608
to his--

249
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,117
SAM: Probably, yes.

250
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:56,078
MARISHA: I walk over to Pike and put my feet in
the water with her, stand on the edge.

251
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,380
TRAVIS: Me, too.

252
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,682
TALIESIN: Oh, also.

253
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:01,175
LIAM: I put my cold feet in, since I have no
shoes.

254
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:06,369
TALIESIN: Wow!

255
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:09,597
LAURA: Shameful.

256
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:14,179
TRAVIS: Is there a sun? A point of light in the
sky?

257
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:24,725
MATT: The sky is gently dappled with faint wisps
of cloud and is blue and beautiful, but you do not

258
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:31,218
see a particular sun in the sky. Though the light
seems to be ever-present, what faint shadows you

259
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:35,678
see seem to be almost from multi-directional
light. There is no actual sun in the sky that you

260
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:36,687
can see.

261
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:41,000
TRAVIS: The light appears ever-present. Strange.

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,737
LAURA: Wow, Grog.

263
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,195
TRAVIS: Ow.

264
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:51,478
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out, see if
there's any movement in the fields while he's

265
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,960
attuning his armor.

266
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,578
MATT: Perception check, please.

267
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,994
LAURA: 24.

268
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:06,905
MATT: All right. As you guys sit there waiting on
the edge of the shoreline, keeping a watch across

269
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:13,277
the waters and the edges of where the beach begins
to slowly form into the rolling hills and the

270
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:20,468
sparse bits of trees that you see marking the
interior of the island, there's no change. It's

271
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:25,996
almost like whatever pattern is here is a set
pattern, or at least, any alterations or changes

272
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:31,305
would be over a very prolonged period of time. You
see no signs of any other life. You see no signs

273
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,618
of any other beings walking within your immediate
eyesight.

274
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:37,149
LAURA: Does it feel nice?

275
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:40,126
MATT: It feels nice. It feels comfortable. It's
welcoming, if a little quiet.

276
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:44,678
TRAVIS: When this rest is over, do we know what
direction we're going in?

277
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:48,865
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Towards the tower.

278
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:52,542
TRAVIS: Jeez, not everybody at fucking once. All
right. Shit.

279
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:56,629
MARISHA: Well, you had such good observation
skills with the whole ever-present light thing.

280
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,588
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

281
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:05,825
MARISHA: Man. You're always a surprise. And after
so many years.

282
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,771
TRAVIS: Thank you.

283
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:23,659
MARISHA: I look at Pike. I say, Pike, this place
is beautiful. It's incredible, and I don't think

284
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:34,070
we would be here if it wasn't for you and your
connection to Sarenrae. And I'm honored to be here

285
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:51,576
with all of you all. And to see this place with
Vax. This makes me happy. Just this moment. This

286
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:58,055
is nice. (sighs) I love you all.

287
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,733
SAM: We love you, too.

288
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,121
LAURA: We love you too, Keyleth.

289
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,228
ASHLEY: I love you, Kiki.

290
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,638
SAM: Just to be clear--

291
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,122
MARISHA: And I use my inspiring leader feat.

292
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:09,100
(laughter)

293
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,021
SAM: I was just about to ask, was that
well-thought-out speech inspirational?

294
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:22,911
MATT: All right, so level 18 that you are, with no
charisma modifier, correct? Everyone gains 18

295
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,158
temporary hit points.

296
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,486
TRAVIS: Damn!

297
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:28,675
LAURA: Are we all healed up and healthy now?

298
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,580
MATT: You did take a long rest. Yeah.

299
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,368
TALIESIN: Oh, we did take a long rest.

300
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:38,094
MATT: There were some healing spells spent on
Pike's end and dealing with the eye that was

301
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:41,569
recovered, I think. And then you with the Plane
Shift.

302
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,374
SAM: Me and Grog got shot a few times.

303
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,179
MATT: Yeah, you got to heal a little bit.

304
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,801
SAM: But I can use some hit dice.

305
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,494
MATT: Yes, you can, during the short rest.

306
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:54,666
LAURA: These Boots of Haste, I don't have to
attune to them? They're not attunable, right? Or

307
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,082
do I have to attune to them?

308
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,812
LIAM: Yes, darling, they are. They're attunable.

309
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:03,610
LAURA: Okay, that's fine. Then I'm just going to
unattune my bracers and attune my Boots of Haste

310
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,829
that I have on. I'm going to spend the next ten
minutes cleaning them up and making them look

311
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,212
really pretty.

312
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:15,126
TALIESIN: You know you're going to get them
back next long rest.

313
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,243
MATT: All right. So you've attuned to the Boots of
Haste.

314
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,672
SAM: Yes.

315
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,603
LAURA: I'm going to get so much shit online.

316
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:25,145
MATT: Broomgate 2.0. (laughs)

317
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:29,383
LIAM: No. It's exactly what you would do when you
almost lose somebody.

318
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:32,817
TRAVIS: (laughs) Keep it coming.

319
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:37,802
MARISHA: I'm so proud. He's as cold as his skin is
right now.

320
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:39,813
LAURA: Don't die anymore.

321
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:43,453
LIAM: It's in character. I mean, don't give her a
hard time.

322
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:53,717
MATT: All right, so you guys finish resting. It is
comfortable. It is nice here and especially, in

323
00:22:53,717 --> 00:23:00,116
the rush of the current state of things, this
brief moment of respite feels so removed from that

324
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:05,070
race, that chaos, that ever-present fear and
doubt. And later you know, whether it's the

325
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,581
surroundings or the general nature of the plane
that you're in, but it's soothing. It's

326
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:17,564
comforting. As you finish your attunement to the
item, you finish your new attunement to your

327
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:25,698
resistance, you guys gather your things, step out
of the water, put your footwear back on, and what

328
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:27,347
would you like to do?

329
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,393
SAM: Walk towards the busty lady.

330
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:31,515
MATT: What's the marching order?

331
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:33,618
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

332
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:35,694
LAURA: We're going to have to fight things in this
beautiful place?

333
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,189
ASHLEY: I'll go first.

334
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,906
TALIESIN: Ash in front.

335
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:40,614
MATT: Okay, Ashley's in front. Who's next?

336
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:42,311
TRAVIS: I'm with Pike.

337
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,795
MATT: All right, Grog's right up there with Pike.

338
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:46,274
LAURA: I'll be behind Grog.

339
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:47,433
TALIESIN: I'll be with you.

340
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,625
LAURA: Lovely.

341
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,084
LIAM: I'm going to trail sheepishly behind
Keyleth.

342
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,728
MARISHA: I was about to say, I don't leave Vax's
side.

343
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:54,936
LAURA: Trinket is out.

344
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,806
MATT: Trinket is out?

345
00:23:56,806 --> 00:24:04,195
LAURA: And he is walking between-- behind me and
Percy. Yeah.

346
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:08,213
SAM: And as always, I'll enjoy the rear.

347
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,166
TRAVIS: Yeah, you will.

348
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:20,024
MATT: Okay, then. All righty, so with Pike leading
on and approaching the pathways that lead towards

349
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:27,128
the center of the island, the rolling hills ascend
higher and higher, the further towards where the

350
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:34,724
distant crystal monolith resides. Up from the
soft, pearl-like sand to reveal large obelisks of

351
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:40,316
carved rectangular stone at off-kilter angles,
jutting out of the ground in places. You had seen

352
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:45,747
some of these at a distance when you arrived and
you as well in your vision, Pike, earlier. The

353
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:50,752
trees you walk past begin to slowly thin out to
replace some of these stone structures. You can

354
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:56,574
see what's almost this outer ring of nature that encloses
the inner portion of this island.

355
00:24:56,574 --> 00:25:06,778
The wind is now warm against your skin as it
begins to whip through this area and you can hear

356
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:14,755
it tear through some of the openings between
these ever densely growing clusters of stonework.

357
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:22,335
Occasionally, these stone structures resemble
figures of old ancient figureheads from the Age of

358
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:27,315
Arcanum, who bore the embrace of the Everlight
with them before her following fell from grace.

359
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:32,083
You can see the ravages of time and the
diminishing of her influence following the

360
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:37,725
Divergence are shown on some of these figures as
they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in

361
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:45,427
places. But still, no sign of anything else moving
on the island.

362
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:51,906
TALIESIN: Does it look like people are avoiding us
or does it look like this is not a place of--

363
00:25:51,906 --> 00:25:53,911
MATT: Make a perception check.

364
00:25:53,911 --> 00:26:01,776
TALIESIN: All right. I had a funny feeling you
would say that. 12.

365
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:08,671
MATT: You see no signs of any movement, any foot
tracks. No signs of anything in the vicinity that

366
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:12,355
would lead you to believe that you're being
avoided or being watched.

367
00:26:12,355 --> 00:26:19,924
LIAM: Does it look like anyone has been here for a
very long time?

368
00:26:19,924 --> 00:26:22,883
MATT: Make an investigation check.

369
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:31,352
LIAM: Oh, I'm not going to waste Luck on that.
That's a one. I have no idea what's going in this

370
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,769
fucking place.

371
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:41,007
MATT: Pike, you lead on. You make your way through
these tangled paths and they shift and curve and

372
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:46,926
turn and the light never seems to change overhead
and as you hike along and chat amongst yourselves

373
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:51,616
and keep open to the vicinity around you and
you're breathing in the clean air with hints of

374
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:57,225
seaspray and saltiness that eventually makes its
way through the breeze. You can feel parts of you

375
00:26:57,225 --> 00:27:02,831
sweat beneath your armor, from the general warmth
of the atmosphere, and you travel for about an

376
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:12,738
hour. Pike, and Vex and Vax and Keyleth, you pick
up on this, too. The crystalline structure in the

377
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:15,273
center of the island doesn't appear to be any
closer.

378
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,939
TRAVIS: Shit.

379
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:21,482
MARISHA: Didn't we go through something like this
before?

380
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,553
TALIESIN: We literally went through this before.

381
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,686
LAURA: We had really think about being there, is
that what we had to do?

382
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:32,627
LIAM: Yes. Pike, do you think you need to talk to
her somehow? Or call to her somehow?

383
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:40,097
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to pull out the key
again.

384
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:46,063
MATT: Okay. The metallic loop. The curved piece of
metal. Okay.

385
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,316
ASHLEY: Yeah.

386
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:49,921
TRAVIS: (quietly) There is no spoon.

387
00:27:49,921 --> 00:28:03,242
ASHLEY: Sarenrae, we have
travelled very far and we are here and if you

388
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:10,201
could give us any guidance to get closer to you I
would be forever grateful.

389
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,275
MATT: You say this out loud?

390
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,202
ASHLEY: Yeah.

391
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:22,313
MATT: Okay. You look out before you, still staring
at the crystal structure. No response.

392
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:28,501
ASHLEY: Okay, I repeat that again in my head.

393
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:32,101
MATT: Okay, so you say it back to yourself in your
head?

394
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,943
ASHLEY: Yeah.

395
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:37,472
TRAVIS: Ticking them off, one at a time. Here we
go.

396
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:45,289
MATT: Okay. So you look forward at the crystalline
structure, looking at its form, and focus on those

397
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:50,672
words on the inside of your head. No response.

398
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:54,741
LAURA: Maybe we have to let her know we're here.

399
00:28:54,741 --> 00:29:01,272
SAM: Pikey-poo. Pikey-pants. You had a religious
thing and talked to your god, right?

400
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,215
ASHLEY: Say again?

401
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:05,553
SAM: You talked to Sarenrae briefly, right?

402
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,112
ASHLEY: Yeah.

403
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,673
SAM: Did she invite you or all of us?

404
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:21,644
LAURA: Oh shit. Is this a thing where you think
you're invited to a party, so you bring your whole

405
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,085
crew and then maybe realize they weren't invited?

406
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:30,323
SAM: Do you want to walk solo for ten minutes and
see if you are, solo, getting any closer?

407
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,832
TALIESIN: We'll keep you in ear contact.

408
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:35,662
LIAM: Is this like party hopping at Comic Con?

409
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:39,822
LAURA: Yeah. Get us on the list. Once you're in
there, then we'll join you in line.

410
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,717
TALIESIN: See how many wristbands you can get.

411
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:54,260
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll keep walking and I'll keep
looking back, thumbs up, and I'll see what I can

412
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,813
find.

413
00:29:55,813 --> 00:30:00,099
MATT: Okay. You walk forward and you can look back
at your friends and you continue to walk forward

414
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:07,386
towards the structure. You eventually begin to
weave between these stone obelisks, which get

415
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:10,993
dense and overlap to the point where maybe
about a hundred feet ahead, you lose sight of

416
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:11,943
Pike.

417
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,848
LAURA: I want to get on my broom and fly up in the
air and see if I can see her from the air.

418
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:20,103
MATT: Okay. You fly up in the air and you look
down and you see her. She's right beyond where you

419
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:23,115
lost sight of her originally, and she's walking
forward.

420
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:27,928
LAURA: Okay, okay. How you doing, Pike?

421
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:35,438
ASHLEY: Good, good. Just traveling over these
stone structures.

422
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:44,307
MATT: All right, you watch. Pike, you walk for
another ten minutes or so on your own, and you

423
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:51,012
watch her travel, and as you focus, she's
travelling, but she's still the same distance from

424
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:56,914
everyone else she was when she left. She went just
beyond eyeline and then it's weird. Like it

425
00:30:56,914 --> 00:31:01,336
doesn't make sense. You watched her maneuver and
change and shift around things, yet she hasn't

426
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:03,190
gotten any further or any closer.

427
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,332
MARISHA: So is it like a side-scrolling
background?

428
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,521
MATT: In a way, I guess.

429
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:12,644
LAURA: What? And I turn around and the ocean is
still where it was, behind us? Pike.

430
00:31:12,644 --> 00:31:16,331
ASHLEY: Does it look like I've gotten far? I feel
like I've gone real far.

431
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:20,531
LAURA: I don't think you've gone far at all, dear.
I think you're in the same place.

432
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,839
TALIESIN: I've got a weird theory.

433
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,271
MARISHA: Is the terrain repeating itself? What was
your theory?

434
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:31,501
TALIESIN: Maybe this is vision-based. Maybe we
have to close our eyes.

435
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:33,175
LAURA: How did we do this before?

436
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,343
TRAVIS: I like this. Let's walk with our eyes
closed.

437
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,183
LAURA: Maybe we just have to think really hard
about being at the tower.

438
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:40,916
TRAVIS: I close my eyes and I start walking
straight ahead.

439
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:44,482
MATT: (laughs) As Grog closes his eyes and starts
walking.

440
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:47,934
LAURA: I close my eyes and think really hard
about being directly in front of the tower.

441
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:50,128
MATT: Okay. Anybody else want to do anything?

442
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:54,346
MARISHA: I start walking the opposite direction.

443
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,013
TRAVIS: Eyes closed or open?

444
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:58,408
MARISHA: Away from the tower, with my eyes open.

445
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:00,377
LIAM: I stand confused and watch Kiki leave us.

446
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,077
MATT: Okay. Keyleth turns away.

447
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:03,906
TALIESIN: I spin three times in a circle.

448
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:08,726
MATT: What are you doing, Pike?

449
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:14,869
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand there and think about
being closer to the tower with my eyes closed.

450
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,224
MATT: Okay. You all begin to close your eyes and
begin walking and start wandering in different

451
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,540
directions and bumping into pieces of stonework.

452
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,107
SAM: Bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the
light.

453
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:36,748
MATT: Pike, you close your eyes for a moment and
concentrate, and your vision is dark. You don't

454
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:43,542
see the world around you, but within a few seconds
of embracing this darkness, a sudden burst of

455
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:50,748
light appears ahead of you, and you see a burning beacon
visible in the direction where the crystal palace

456
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:53,683
was before you.

457
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:55,434
SAM: Just Pike?

458
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:56,998
MATT: Just Pike.

459
00:32:56,998 --> 00:33:03,286
ASHLEY: So I'll try keeping my eyes closed and
start walking towards it.

460
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:10,715
MATT: Okay. As you guys are figuring yourself out,
and you are concentrating so hard on being

461
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:11,845
there--

462
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:14,479
MARISHA: I turn around. Is the tower any
closer?

463
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,388
MATT: Nope.

464
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,236
MARISHA: Is it further?

465
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:17,168
MATT: Yep.

466
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:18,934
MARISHA: Shit. I walk back.

467
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,872
MATT: Okay. You join the rest of the group and you
watch half your party still stumbling into pieces

468
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:28,510
of stone. Pike, you with your eyes closed, still
seeing this burning beacon, this circular

469
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:36,445
sphere wreathed in flame that just licks up as the
flames slowly burn out of the bottom of this

470
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:43,037
structure and flicker off into nothing. You step
for about two minutes or so in its direction, and

471
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:50,673
the heat gets warmer and warmer and warmer, and
then you open your eyes for a moment and you're

472
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:52,243
right in front of it.

473
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,529
ASHLEY: Hey, guys, can you see me?

474
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,279
LAURA and SAM: Can we hear her?

475
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,188
MATT: You guys can hear her, yeah.

476
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,972
LAURA: Oh shit. I open my eyes.

477
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:05,973
MATT: You look down and she's right in front of
the crystal structure.

478
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:09,953
LAURA: She got all the fucking way there? What did
you do, Pike?

479
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:14,028
ASHLEY: I just thought about it. I closed my eyes
and I started walking.

480
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:15,329
LAURA: That's what I fucking did.

481
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,088
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, too. Ow.

482
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,015
LAURA: Open your eyes, Grog.

483
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,810
MARISHA: I walked the other way, and it definitely
didn't work.

484
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:28,841
SAM: What is she doing that we're not doing? Her
hair is partially blue. Maybe we should dye our

485
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,690
hair blue, as well.

486
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:35,886
ASHLEY: Maybe you can only get here if you're a
believer of Sarenrae.

487
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:42,499
SAM: Oh. I'm a believer. Can I try?

488
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,389
ASHLEY: (singing) I'm a believer.

489
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,942
SAM: All right.

490
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:48,163
MATT: You close your eyes?

491
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:53,571
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to clutch my symbol of
Sarenrae and I'm going to close my eyes and I'm

492
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:55,719
going to see if anything happens.

493
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,434
MATT: You sit there in silence for about a minute
and a half as the darkness is there before you,

494
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:03,609
pitch black. And you're clutching the symbol as
hard as you can with your fingers, to the point

495
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:08,715
where it's almost hurting your hand, and you see
the faintest distant flicker.

496
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:12,349
SAM: I'm going to go towards it.

497
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,748
MATT: You guys watch Scanlan, eyes closed, begin
walking towards the crystalline structure.

498
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,188
LAURA: It's working for him.

499
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,511
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow him.

500
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:24,339
LAURA: I'm going to try to follow him. I'm not
going to aim for the tower, I'm going to try to

501
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,778
get to Pike.

502
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:28,080
MATT: Okay. So you're going straight for Pike?

503
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,983
LAURA: Yeah.

504
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:31,090
MATT: Okay. And you're following Scanlan?

505
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,602
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just nonchalantly.

506
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:35,249
MATT: Okay. Vax? Keyleth? Grog?

507
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,989
MARISHA: What do we do?

508
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:38,754
TRAVIS: I'm not going anywhere.

509
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:40,699
ASHLEY: Come on, Grog.

510
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:45,963
TRAVIS: I'm confused. I want to see what happens
to those two when they follow.

511
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:48,291
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

512
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,881
LIAM: How is it working? What are you guys doing?

513
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,580
MARISHA: They're believers.

514
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,018
SAM: Maybe you guys have to believe.

515
00:35:56,018 --> 00:36:02,840
LIAM: Well, I think that the existence of a
pantheon of gods is a well-established fact in our

516
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,070
world, so I believe.

517
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,931
SAM: So poetic.

518
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,766
MARISHA: Do I have to believe deeper than that?

519
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,033
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, you need reverence.

520
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:15,910
MATT: Scanlan and Percival disappear into the
brush ahead of you guys as you're having this

521
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:21,523
conversation. You, rushing towards Pike, as you're
going towards her, you're not getting any closer.

522
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:26,388
You can see things rushing past you, but
there's some disconnect, that as soon as you begin

523
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:33,968
to change focus, you're right where you were. Grog
and Scanlan. Scanlan, you step forward, and that

524
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:38,486
beacon becomes brighter and warmer, and you feel the
warmth and you open your eyes, and you're there

525
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:43,186
next to Pike, in front of the palace. And Grog,
you walked alongside Scanlan, and you walked as he

526
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:46,845
watched and you went past the brush and suddenly,
you're at the palace.

527
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,296
TRAVIS: I'm there?!

528
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:53,145
MATT: Yeah. Sorry, not Grog. Percy was. You stayed
back. I misremembered.

529
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,611
LIAM: I grab Keyleth's hands.

530
00:36:54,611 --> 00:37:01,666
MATT: Percival. That's my fault. So Percival,
you made it past the boundary with Scanlan.

531
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:05,703
LAURA: How did you-- how did-- Shit. We should
have followed Pike.

532
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:08,063
MARISHA: But Percy, you don't believe in anything.
This is bullshit!

533
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:12,024
TALIESIN: I believe in plenty of things. But,
yeah, no, I agree. This is bullshit.

534
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:18,529
LAURA: I'm going to close my eyes and be like,
Sarenrae, I really believe in you. You're so holy,

535
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:24,502
and very divine and beautiful, and I think you do
really good things for Pike, and I'm very happy

536
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:25,870
about that.

537
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,959
MATT: You concentrate. A minute. Two minutes. Five
minutes.

538
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,611
LAURA: Fuck. This is not working!

539
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,976
TALIESIN: Pike. Pike, do you want to collect the
rest of them and lead them back here?

540
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:40,313
LIAM: I scoop up Keyleth's hands and I say, you
trust me, right?

541
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:42,094
MARISHA: Yeah.

542
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,131
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, you know that good feeling that
you have when you hang out with Pike? You know

543
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:52,192
that warm feeling you have. Toasting marshmallows
with her around the fire, that kind of feeling?

544
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:53,715
MARISHA: Yeah.

545
00:37:53,715 --> 00:38:00,791
LIAM: You know that comes from Sarenrae, so focus
on that with me. And we'll go to Pike. Focus on

546
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:03,076
Sarenrae and that marshmallow feeling.

547
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:05,994
MARISHA: But that comes from Pike, not from
Sarenrae.

548
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:10,642
LIAM: You know that's partially true, but not all
true. Come on, give it a shot.

549
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:13,085
MARISHA: Okay. I try really hard.

550
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,955
MATT: To?

551
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:18,935
MARISHA: Think about the marshmallowy goodness
that is Sarenrae.

552
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:22,021
MATT: Okay. Vax and Keyleth do this. And then what
do you do?

553
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:29,242
LIAM: Close our eyes and show reverence to her.

554
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:37,572
MATT: Okay. Another five, six minutes of darkness
passes. Your eyes are closed. No beacon. Nothing.

555
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:41,152
ASHLEY: Okay. How long will it take me to walk
back to them?

556
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,624
MATT: Do you walk back to them?

557
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:44,811
ASHLEY: I want to walk back to them.

558
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:51,122
MATT: Okay. A minute. You emerge from the brush,
and you walk and see Keyleth and Vax, eyes closed,

559
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:55,333
clutching hands, just hoping. And Grog, looking
bored as hell.

560
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,572
ASHLEY: Okay. Where's Vex?

561
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:00,727
LAURA: I'm up here, dear.

562
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:10,497
ASHLEY: Okay. Come here. I have an idea. Okay? So
everybody, hold onto me somehow.

563
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:13,052
TRAVIS: Hold hands? Like preschool?

564
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:14,468
ASHLEY: Yeah.

565
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:15,871
LAURA: Like a train?

566
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:23,043
ASHLEY: Yeah. Just don't let go. And I'm going to
think real hard, and maybe we'll all be there

567
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:23,976
together.

568
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,023
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay.

569
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:26,313
MARISHA: Okay. We have to walk, though, right?

570
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:27,392
TRAVIS: Eyes closed.

571
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:30,032
LAURA: All right. I'm not closing my eyes. I'm
just holding onto Pike's hand.

572
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,143
MARISHA: I'm still thinking about marshmallows,
though.

573
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,673
TRAVIS: Thinking about bacon.

574
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:35,305
LIAM: I grab Pike by the earlobe.

575
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:37,821
ASHLEY: That tickles.

576
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:43,380
MATT: And Pike, do you close your eyes and follow
that beacon once more?

577
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,604
ASHLEY: Yes.

578
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:51,385
MATT: Okay. As you guys walk alongside, focusing
on Pike and her leading this small pack of friends

579
00:39:51,385 --> 00:40:00,530
along through the heavily rolling hills and the pieces
of stone obstruction that force you to make your

580
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,912
way around. You help guide her around these
various obstructions that get in the way. Pike,

581
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:09,432
you're concentrating on this burning beacon of
warmth ahead of you. And within three minutes of

582
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:16,409
travel, it seemed almost closer than when
you saw her disappear before. You guys look at

583
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:21,503
her, and glance up and you've just come across the
threshold of the stones, and you're now in this

584
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:25,913
open sandy patch at the base of this large crystal
structure.

585
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:28,616
LAURA: Nice! Good job, Pike.

586
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:31,869
TRAVIS: Pikey-poo.

587
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,556
ASHLEY: Look at this.

588
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:37,960
MATT: So now standing-- (laughs)

589
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,011
LAURA: (laughing) It's beautiful.

590
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:44,285
ASHLEY: It's so much more beautiful up close.

591
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:49,996
MATT: Standing before this magnificent glass-like
structure, you can see the winding shapes and

592
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:53,974
edges clearly ascending in the form of a female
torso, rising from beneath the sands to a

593
00:40:53,974 --> 00:40:59,825
staggering height. Two wings of glittering crystal
curving upward to frame a massive round red gem

594
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:06,704
that shines above the head of the woman, with
flames curling from the inside of the facets. This

595
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:14,603
red gem would probably be about twice the size of
Grog. It's hard to see the actual height of it

596
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:18,054
here, but it's probably close to a hundred feet
tall, the entire structure.

597
00:41:18,054 --> 00:41:25,381
Now, you see the shifting flicker of the intense
fire that burns within the palace, now, it's

598
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:31,223
causing the shadows cast by all nearby things to
dance behind you, and in the inside you can see

599
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:39,539
what appears to be a heavy bonfire almost that is
visible beyond a 20-foot domed doorway right

600
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:47,848
at the base of the torso. As you begin to approach the
entrance to this crystalline palace-like statue,

601
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:53,743
the heat of those flames that you see 
inside, roaring and burning quickly, get hotter

602
00:41:53,743 --> 00:42:01,822
and hotter on your skin. And as you begin to enter
the interior of this structure, the heat feels

603
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:06,787
like it should be getting close to unbearable, but
it never hurts. You acknowledge the temperature

604
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:17,084
change, and you're used to knowing this much heat
should hurt, but it never does. It's just hot and

605
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:25,989
welcoming. You now stand within the hollow
interior of this incredible wonder, looking at a

606
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:30,874
spiraling red tower of orange-red flame that
reaches up about 60 feet or so, in this spiral.

607
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:40,184
It's all flame. This large bonfire in the center
of this structure. It flares rhythmically, like a

608
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:48,941
very intentional heartbeat. (roaring flames)
Giving these whipping sounds of the heat, and the

609
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:53,243
wind and the air that it's tossing upward and out
into the rest of the island around you and you now

610
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:57,011
begin to acknowledge the warm winds that were
blowing through the island, all seem to be

611
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:59,674
centering and spiraling out from the center of the
island.

612
00:42:59,674 --> 00:43:06,804
And it's at that point that you see something in
the flame begin to take shape. You watch as this

613
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:17,705
dark outline begins to open up as two large wings
unfurl from within, revealing feathers of ivory

614
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:25,586
and pearl, like the beach you arrived on, as this
15-foot-tall feminine vision of Sarenrae emerges

615
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:33,511
from the roaring pyre, long curling flames burn as
her hair from her beautiful dark skin framing a

616
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:39,820
warm and motherly smile, her eyes gold and brown
like the most polished brass. Her robes of light

617
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:45,346
blue unfurl in endless strands that almost seem to
tether her to the inferno behind her, and as she

618
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:52,773
emerges from the flame, you can't help but find
yourself stunned and awed at the presence. Her

619
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:58,959
standing there unsinged from the flames, slowly
descends, still floating above you, her arms out,

620
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:05,227
her wings and hair unfurled, almost like a canopy
above the group as you look up at her. Her face

621
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:11,463
turns and smiles onto small Pike on the ground,
and you hear her voice for the first time for all

622
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:20,703
of you, but not the first for Pike, who has heard
her voice for a very long time. "My Pike, you come

623
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:30,120
"to me after all this time. Such a beacon in a very
dark world. Welcome."

624
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:47,961
ASHLEY: I take a knee. Thank you for letting us
come here. It's just such an honor to be in your

625
00:44:47,961 --> 00:45:03,178
presence and to meet you in person. I've been a
believer of yours for my whole life, and to

626
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:08,939
actually be here in front of you is very
humbling.

627
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:19,273
MATT: She descends faintly. Her massive form
slowly seems to-- not shrink, but shift perspective

628
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:28,548
a bit, where once she was this massive entity
before you, seems almost human in size as the hand

629
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:35,846
comes down and reaches and touches the top of
Pike's forehead and just runs down the nose, onto

630
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:46,028
her chin. And you see the brow furrow a bit as she
says, "You vanished from my sight. You walk paths

631
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:54,618
"cast in shadow. My sands whisper thoughts of
sorrow and foreboding. I must know from you all,

632
00:45:54,618 --> 00:46:00,049
"what dark tidings bring you before me harboring
such emotion?"

633
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:18,205
ASHLEY: Well, I think last time we spoke, we took
on a battle that we were not able to complete and

634
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:23,140
we need your help.

635
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,377
MATT: "What type of foe do you face?"

636
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:32,392
LAURA: You know Vecna?

637
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:43,700
MATT: She looks to you a bit. There's a faint bit
of recognition. "This entity, this Vecna, is

638
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:54,761
"clouded, even in history. I know little myself,
and with my sands, they know little of this undying

639
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:58,894
"king. I imagine by his own design."

640
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:04,047
LAURA: He deals in secrets. It's kind of his
thing.

641
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:07,846
MATT: "What can you tell me?"

642
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:11,618
TALIESIN: We have a piece of him.

643
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,597
LAURA: We do.

644
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:21,636
SAM: Yes. Maybe. Well, we can tell you that he is
awful, evil, pure evil incarnate, and he wants to

645
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:22,973
be a god.

646
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,406
LIAM: He has eyes on your territory.

647
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:34,146
MARISHA: He is something of a demigod now, you
could say, and well on his path to ascension.

648
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,815
MATT: "Ascension?"

649
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,587
MARISHA: He wants to be like you.

650
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:40,170
MATT: "How?"

651
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:45,138
MARISHA: Or I guess he wants to be like the Raven
Queen.

652
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:52,979
MATT: You watch the flames grow a little more
cool, a little more of a deeper red in color, and

653
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:59,319
the brow furrows more and she pulls back a little
bit from Pike. Not in a retraction, but a worried

654
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:06,068
sense that seems to fill the room. The brightness
of the outside sky seems to dim ever so slightly.

655
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:12,699
"Ascension? The Raven Queen, you say?"

656
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:24,906
MARISHA: He could tell you more, but I know she
was a mortal who rose to her godhood, and I know

657
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:27,807
he's looking for a similar path.

658
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:30,318
MATT: "Impossible."

659
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:32,613
MARISHA: We've seen it.

660
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:36,650
LAURA: He's been working on it for a very long
time.

661
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,228
LIAM: And obviously hungry for power.

662
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:48,745
MATT: The wings, still unfurled, the tips seem to
almost curl in a bit as she, as opposed to

663
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:55,258
floating above you out and about, is now standing tall
floating above the ground about five or six feet.

664
00:48:55,258 --> 00:49:00,281
Her vision, her eyes seem to drift from you and
look out past the glass and crystal to the distant

665
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:06,900
shores beyond as she speaks out, exclaiming the
thoughts as they come across her mind. Sarenrae

666
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:18,749
says, "The Ritual of Seeding is one of the Matron
of Raven's design. It is the secret rite that

667
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:24,972
"rebirthed her from her mortal trials and granted
her the powers to take her place among the Prime

668
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:34,749
"Gods and become custodian to the realms between
life and death, fate and the cold of winter. But

669
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:43,727
"this ritual was summarily cast from all knowledge
and sealed, intent for eternity, by all who walk

670
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:51,191
"the paths of divinity. None should know this. None
should know this."

671
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:55,670
LAURA: What about the goddess Ioun? The goddess of
knowledge? Would she have known?

672
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,252
MATT: "She was the one who spearheaded its
destruction."

673
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:06,280
LAURA: Vecna's been taking over her chapels?
Temples?

674
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:13,299
MATT: "I know not where Ioun is. She is hidden
away. The Dawnfather would know more than I. They

675
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:27,121
"were together when she was wounded. If this ritual
has come into the hands of another mortal, where

676
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,580
"is this mortal now?"

677
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:36,988
TALIESIN: We have his eye in a box. It's powerful
and intelligent.

678
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:40,060
ASHLEY: I take out the box.

679
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:48,411
MARISHA: He's slowly staked out on the Prime
Material plane. Just north of Vasselheim, about

680
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,056
350 miles.

681
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:52,912
LAURA: Recently completed a ritual in the
Shadowfell.

682
00:50:52,912 --> 00:51:00,621
MATT: "If he's finished the seed, he's already on
his way."

683
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:01,982
LAURA: Oh no.

684
00:51:01,982 --> 00:51:03,974
MARISHA: What does that mean? How can we stop
him?

685
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:12,842
MATT: "The ritual takes some time, from what I
recall. I don't know how long. I was not its

686
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:21,312
"architect. I was not the one who sealed it. Ioun
would be the one to ask. However, if this is

687
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:30,043
"completed, then the Accord of the Divergence is in
danger. If we will have one god on one side of the

688
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:44,602
"Divine Gate and the others on the other, we could
not stop him. Understand, in order for any of us

689
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:50,079
"to directly interfere to seal a god like we did
once long ago, we would have to tear down the

690
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:59,792
"Divine Gate and that would release an entirely new
armageddon upon your world. So either you stop him

691
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:05,523
"and seal him, or you live amongst the only god we
cannot stop."

692
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:11,103
LAURA: How do we seal away a god?

693
00:52:11,103 --> 00:52:19,603
MATT: "I don't know. I was betrayed during the
Calamity. I was not present when they began to

694
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:25,819
"seal the Betrayer Gods. You'd do best to speak
with maybe some of the others who were more

695
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:31,612
"prominent in that time. You walk in Elysium. This
is the realm also of Pelor."

696
00:52:31,612 --> 00:52:33,664
LAURA: The Dawnfather?

697
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,172
MATT: "Yes."

698
00:52:35,172 --> 00:52:39,713
TRAVIS: Might I ask, does Kord reside in Elysium?

699
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:48,258
MATT: "No, but you could perhaps speak with him,
too. I don't know much about Kord. We don't see

700
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:57,613
"eye to eye." And if you could see a goddess glance
sidelong with embarrassment, this is the closest

701
00:52:57,613 --> 00:53:06,304
you'd ever see. "I've fallen from import over
recent years, until recently."

702
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:08,200
SAM: You?

703
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,373
TRAVIS: No.

704
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:21,337
MATT: She looks down at Pike for a minute. "Until
recently." And turns back to Scanlan and says,

705
00:53:21,337 --> 00:53:24,174
"And don't think your prayers have gone unheard,
as well."

706
00:53:24,174 --> 00:53:35,334
SAM: You heard? I'm new at praying. I'm sorry for
all the cursing at first. I had a lot of emotions,

707
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:43,291
and I didn't know if anyone was listening.
Apologies, but you heard me at night?

708
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,879
MATT: "When your heart was true to it, yes."

709
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:57,554
SAM: Wow. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Because some of that is personal stuff.

710
00:53:57,554 --> 00:54:14,349
MATT: She smiles and averts her gaze from you. "Do
you know if this mortal, this man, this Vecna, do

711
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:21,525
"you know in your heart of hearts, Pike, that this
man is beyond redemption? Is there any spark of

712
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:24,724
"hope in his heart to turn him back to the light?"

713
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:40,093
ASHLEY: Well, I would always hope that in
somebody, but at least the time spent with him

714
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:47,384
that we have, it doesn't seem that that's his
path.

715
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:54,243
MATT: "Well, I trust in your insight, and this is
your judgment to make. The greatest judgment you

716
00:54:54,243 --> 00:55:03,487
"may ever make. As you walk this path, closer to
conflict with this entity, search yourself for any

717
00:55:03,487 --> 00:55:10,866
"glimmer, and if there is no redemption to be had,
then smite him with all the might I have granted

718
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:11,875
"you."

719
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:16,349
ASHLEY: Okay.

720
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:22,917
LAURA: He's not doing a lot of talking to us.

721
00:55:22,917 --> 00:55:26,040
TRAVIS: A lot of killing, disintegrating.

722
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,841
SAM: How will we know if he's a god or not?

723
00:55:29,841 --> 00:55:35,111
MATT: "You'll know. We all will know."

724
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:38,387
LAURA: So it hasn't happened yet?

725
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:39,851
MATT: "Not yet."

726
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:41,057
LAURA: Okay.

727
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:44,658
MARISHA: How long do these seeding rituals usually
take? How much time do we have?

728
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:52,848
MATT: "I don't know. You would have to ask those
who were responsible for sealing it."

729
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,627
TRAVIS: Dawnfather.

730
00:55:54,627 --> 00:56:11,208
MARISHA: I'm so confused. That's it? We didn't
walk away from him unscathed the first time, and

731
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:13,797
we're just supposed to try again?

732
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:21,088
MATT: "Even in the dark days of the Calamity, the
might of our weapons could only diminish the

733
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:29,670
"betrayers who rose against creation. The two that
orchestrated our victory and designed the means of

734
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:38,888
"sealing away such terrible evil, I've already
mentioned. They would be of more aid than I. The

735
00:56:38,888 --> 00:56:46,408
"Knowing Mistress Ioun, as wounded and hidden away
as she is, and the Dawnfather, warden to the

736
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:56,554
"Chained Oblivion. His fortress across the fields
of Elysium. I could send you there."

737
00:56:56,554 --> 00:57:00,103
TALIESIN: That would be quite helpful.

738
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:01,621
TRAVIS: It was hard getting here.

739
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:05,910
LAURA: Will he be as accepting as you?

740
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:22,620
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't spoken much with
the others in some time."

741
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:28,068
LAURA: You should throw a party. Invite them all.
Get to know them again.

742
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:43,971
MATT: She looks down at Pike once more. "My Pike,
you've done more than you know. You've been a

743
00:57:43,971 --> 00:57:59,518
"guiding light for these wonderful champions and so
many more." She reaches down and lifts you off the

744
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:05,140
ground a bit, looking at your face, the bit of
sadness that creeps across it as she lifts you up

745
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:14,520
and you guys watch as she glides, passing through
the crystal, Pike being brought below the archway

746
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:27,000
as she just lifts her out beyond this crystal
structure. She ascends upward about 25, 30 feet or

747
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,587
so, holding Pike in her hands out in front of her.

748
00:58:32,587 --> 00:58:34,323
And just chucks her.

749
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:35,858
(laughter)

750
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:47,070
MATT: No. Holding her close-- and by this point,
Sarenrae's form has expanded to almost the size of

751
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:52,305
the crystal structure you came to. You can now see
a parallel between her wings and her form and her

752
00:58:52,305 --> 00:59:01,744
torso as to the actual incredible presence of this
god before you. And leans in, as she shows the

753
00:59:01,744 --> 00:59:10,451
island to Pike below and whispers close to your
ear, "I'm not lonely here, Pike, for my sands

754
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:21,963
"remain with me, speak with me, and we learn from
each other. Look." As she extends her arm, Pike,

755
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:30,692
you look out, and all of the light of the sky
seems to shine at once through every pearl, every

756
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:35,740
grain of the beach sand that you've walked across.
And where once you saw what was just a barren

757
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:46,591
landscape, you now see thousands and thousands and
thousands of people. Opaque. Translucent. Souls of

758
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:53,970
those that have come to Sarenrae since the dawn of
creation. Those who swore themselves to good under

759
00:59:53,970 --> 01:00:00,610
her banner and at the end of their lives came to
become part of the Island of Renewal and forever

760
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:05,514
live with her and amongst the rest of the
community of people that are warmed under her

761
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:15,080
light. They all seem to look up at once at you,
and you sense them smiling, as the vision fades

762
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,118
and the island goes back untouched.

763
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:31,700
She drifts back down and places you on the ground.
"You see, one day, you will join us, too. And we

764
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:41,773
"will all have so many stories to share." You now
see her hovering over all of you as you step out

765
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:53,010
of this to join Pike on the exterior of this
tower. "While I am diminished, my powers limited,

766
01:00:53,010 --> 01:01:04,242
"you do possibly face something terrible, unseen
since the Calamity. And for this journey, Pike, I

767
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:07,820
"grant you my blessing."

768
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:14,452
And as she reaches her hands out and they expand,
her head lifts up, her eyes close, and her wings

769
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:22,739
flare into a phoenix-like flame that just
emblazons the sky with light and fire. The heat is

770
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:27,779
more intense than anything you've felt, yet still
there's no pain. It's just all-consuming. It's

771
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:35,298
like the rebirth of a phoenix and you're all
surrounded by it. For a moment, it's all there is

772
01:01:35,298 --> 01:01:45,254
in existence, just this incredible entity. And then
the flames slowly die away, except for the flames

773
01:01:45,254 --> 01:01:53,972
that currently engulf Pike's gnome form. And as
the flames burn away, you can see on Pike the

774
01:01:53,972 --> 01:02:07,684
familiar set of wings you've seen her spiritual
form hold, which fold in and then dissipate. You

775
01:02:07,684 --> 01:02:09,360
now have the Blessing of the Everlight.

776
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,483
(cheering)

777
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:15,544
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness! What is that?

778
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:19,911
MATT: You get a plus-two bonus to your
constitution.

779
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:21,255
ASHLEY: Okay.

780
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:23,514
TRAVIS: We'll take a picture and text it to you.

781
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:25,122
ASHLEY: Okay.

782
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:32,914
MATT: As a bonus action, you can summon the wings
of the Everlight, granting you a flying speed of

783
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:39,953
40 feet for up to ten minutes. And while you have
these wings, any spells you cast that cause

784
01:02:39,953 --> 01:02:43,114
creatures to regain hit points heal an additional
ten hit points.

785
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:46,004
(cheering)

786
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:48,741
MATT: But once this ability is used, you can't use
it for another seven days.

787
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:50,448
ALL: Oh.

788
01:02:50,448 --> 01:02:53,745
ASHLEY: Man, I love her so much.

789
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:58,236
MATT: So if you want to take a picture and send
that to her. Here we go. Hold onto that and give

790
01:02:58,236 --> 01:02:59,703
it to her.

791
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:01,279
MARISHA: Is Sarenrae gone?

792
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:04,377
MATT: No. Sarenrae is still there, just the flames
have burned away.

793
01:03:04,377 --> 01:03:06,428
LAURA: I'm going to send this to you, Ashley.

794
01:03:06,428 --> 01:03:09,644
TALIESIN: I'm right here, guys. It's really not
cool.

795
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:11,935
ASHLEY: Oh man!

796
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:25,565
LAURA: Since Sarenrae is still standing there, I
want to say to her-- shit.

797
01:03:25,565 --> 01:03:28,194
TRAVIS: Good start.

798
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:42,454
LAURA: Shit, sorry. I want to apologize. This
feels so stupid. I want to apologize for never

799
01:03:42,454 --> 01:03:58,085
realizing what you are and what this could be and
for not showing you the reverence that you

800
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:10,848
deserve. And I hope to change that in the future,
and I will certainly think differently from here

801
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,125
on out.

802
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:16,885
MATT: As you look down and look up, where once she
was this large entity above you, you look down and

803
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:29,416
look up, and she's right before you. "No apologies
necessary. The creation of Exandria, the peoples

804
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:40,981
"that populate it and develop and design, innovate
and worship, was with free will to make your own

805
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:51,767
"path. Faith is important to some, but the intent
was to instill you with the means of doing and

806
01:04:51,767 --> 01:05:01,376
"choosing whatever and however you like. We do not
wish reverence of all. Just those who find us. At

807
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:04,768
"least, I speak for myself."

808
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:10,005
LAURA: Well, I think you're pretty wonderful.

809
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:12,034
MATT: "There is balance to everything."

810
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:19,482
LAURA: And I took these from your beach. It
doesn't seem right.

811
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:26,919
MATT: She takes the pouch from you and pours it
out, and as the pearls are about to land, they

812
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:31,466
drift off and dart off back to the location where
you originally found them.

813
01:05:31,466 --> 01:05:44,335
ASHLEY: Same. I just thought I wanted to take a
little piece with me, but I already have that. I

814
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:46,769
didn't know what it was.

815
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:50,020
MATT: As you empty the pearls, they also dart off
towards the beach where you first landed.

816
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,984
LAURA: I just thought they were really pretty.

817
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:58,398
ASHLEY: I would have told you before we left, you
know.

818
01:05:58,398 --> 01:06:08,650
MATT: "It's all right. But for everything great
that we may have created, you continue to create

819
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:21,847
"far better. Our existence brings threat. We've
brought two calamities before. We try and avoid a

820
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:30,604
"third. Whether we diminish in time or just
maintain this balance, it's you, and your

821
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:36,149
"children, and your children's children, that hold
the keys to the future of your lives, your people,

822
01:06:36,149 --> 01:06:43,693
"your culture, and us. So don't apologize."

823
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:50,809
TRAVIS: Would you say Sarenrae's attractive?

824
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:56,669
MATT: Are you asking her, or is this a question to
me as the DM?

825
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:58,445
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one.

826
01:06:58,445 --> 01:07:03,360
MATT: She's beautiful. I wouldn't put it in terms
of any sort of a sexual object.

827
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,318
TRAVIS: She's just beautiful.

828
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:10,709
MATT: She's just an incredibly beautiful,
powerful, feminine form. And, to the extent where

829
01:07:10,709 --> 01:07:17,079
Grog, who usually being a man who's driven by base
needs, not a single thought comes across you in

830
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:21,878
any base or defacing way, it is too powerful. It
overwhelms it.

831
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:24,117
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, she's beautiful.

832
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:26,990
MARISHA: What are titties?

833
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:30,349
LAURA: What even are titties?

834
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:33,828
MARISHA: What do titties?

835
01:07:33,828 --> 01:07:39,486
TRAVIS: I'm keeping my little pearl from the
beach.

836
01:07:39,486 --> 01:07:44,012
MARISHA: (laughs) That you've been trying to
crush?

837
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:45,871
TRAVIS: Yeah.

838
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:51,625
LAURA: Terrible. Matt's like, shady shit.

839
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,836
TRAVIS: We're going to need one, y'all gave yours
back.

840
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:57,649
TALIESIN: It's going to be like the Wonka factory,
it's just it's going to turn on you.

841
01:07:57,649 --> 01:08:01,086
MATT: You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You now have
to be watched.

842
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:05,830
TALIESIN: Pearls from the beach, you get nothing,
sir! Good day!

843
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,509
MATT: (laughing) Good day, sir!

844
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:09,218
TRAVIS: It's just one!

845
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:21,670
MATT: I know. "You have my blessing, Pike. Do this
for me, do this for them, do this for you. Do this

846
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:39,220
"for all of creation. And do it soon. The longer
you wait, well, the longer you wait. Do you wish

847
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,849
"to be off to the Dawnfather?"

848
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:45,920
SAM: Yes, time is of the essence. We should go
right away.

849
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:52,150
MARISHA: Is he as warm and welcoming and nice as
you are?

850
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:54,243
MATT: (laughs)

851
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:56,179
MARISHA: Okay, that's a good answer.

852
01:08:56,179 --> 01:09:01,615
MATT: With a bright white flash emanating from her
torso and arms, your vision just goes white and

853
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:09,231
you all blink for a moment as your head spins for
but a brief instant. Your feet touch hard ground

854
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:16,214
and you all immediately reach up and rub your
eyes, and as your vision slowly coalesces once

855
01:09:16,214 --> 01:09:26,416
more, you find yourself standing in the deep
center of some vast orchard, surrounded by an

856
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:33,242
endless sea of fruit-bearing trees of all sizes,
shapes and colors, intertwined, the canopy broken

857
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:43,311
and sparse in places where you can see above a
clear, blue, cloudless sky. You're no longer on

858
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:46,991
the Island of Renewal, that's for sure.

859
01:09:46,991 --> 01:09:50,003
LAURA: Oh, I thought, but isn't that where the
Dawnfather is?

860
01:09:50,003 --> 01:09:58,479
MATT: Island of Renewal is where Sarenrae is. The
blessed fields of Elysium is the plane. He existed

861
01:09:58,479 --> 01:09:59,811
elsewhere in there.

862
01:09:59,811 --> 01:10:01,634
LAURA: I understand now.

863
01:10:01,634 --> 01:10:06,181
MARISHA: Is there the same ever-light sky?

864
01:10:06,181 --> 01:10:08,279
MATT: Make a nature check.

865
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:17,772
MARISHA: Ever-present, sorry. Ever-presence in
light. I use my druidic die. 29. Sorry, 31.

866
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:23,118
MATT: It's hard to see from down low, because the
canopy does choke it a bit, you can see bits of

867
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:28,510
the sky that appear blue, cloudless, whereas you
saw wisps of cloud over the island, this appears

868
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,901
clear, you can climb up a bit and try to get a
better look if you want.

869
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:33,222
MARISHA: Sure.

870
01:10:33,222 --> 01:10:37,921
MATT: Okay, so you begin to leap up through the
branches, and a lot of the trees here have winding

871
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:42,364
and knotted branches, so it's pretty easy to find
your way up the canopy after maybe a five minute

872
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:49,012
climb. You get up and peek over and you can see
now this orchard goes on for miles and miles, and

873
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:54,841
miles, filling this vast valley that you can
barely see mountains that crest the edge of it in

874
01:10:54,841 --> 01:11:01,189
the distance near the horizon. You also see there
is no cloud in the sky, and there is no sun, but

875
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:10,632
there is a single pillar of light that streaks
down from way way up, the zenith striking down in

876
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:16,678
the center of this orchard, where there you see
before you this awe-inspiring sight of the

877
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:25,482
Dawnfather's home: a gold-plated citadel of many
humongous towers and spires that both resembles a

878
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:33,427
military fortress and the largest-steepled church
you've ever seen. It's hard to gauge distance with

879
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:38,046
so many trees between you and it, you don't know
if it's miles off from you, if it's maybe a

880
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:43,022
thousand feet or so, but even at this distance,
it's incredible in its scale.

881
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:48,273
MARISHA: Oh. Hey, guys, Pelor's not messing
around.

882
01:11:48,273 --> 01:11:52,611
TRAVIS: They make really tall things here.

883
01:11:52,611 --> 01:12:03,816
LAURA: I fly up next to Keyleth so I can see. Wow.
Do you think this is like Sarenrae, where we can't

884
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:08,313
get to him unless we have him in our heart?

885
01:12:08,313 --> 01:12:19,366
MARISHA: You know, I feel a little bit more
connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm

886
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:22,534
surrounded by trees. This I can relate to.

887
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:26,034
LAURA: I mean, I've tried to talk to Pelor
before.

888
01:12:26,034 --> 01:12:30,223
MARISHA: I've talked to the Sun Tree. (gasps) I
wonder if the Sun Tree is here? Maybe he's got a

889
01:12:30,223 --> 01:12:32,172
twin here like you have a twin!

890
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:34,210
LAURA: Maybe.

891
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:41,084
TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of the fruit that's
growing on the trees?

892
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:43,464
MATT: Make a nature check.

893
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:46,613
TALIESIN: Yeah. 15.

894
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,343
MARISHA: Decent for a city boy.

895
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:58,647
MATT: It's interesting. This orchard-- various
fruits thrive in various climates. As you begin to

896
01:12:58,647 --> 01:13:05,153
walk a little bit through, it is a peppering of
all sorts of trees and fruits. You see apples of

897
01:13:05,153 --> 01:13:12,023
all shades, you see oranges, you see rare passion
fruits, you see floral-based growing fruit. It's a

898
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:15,511
perpetual harvest here.

899
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:18,615
LAURA: I rush down and say, don't eat the fruit!

900
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:19,915
SAM: Might be souls?

901
01:13:19,915 --> 01:13:21,618
LAURA: I think it might be souls!

902
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:25,672
TRAVIS: No, it's fruit! Souls don't grow on
trees.

903
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:29,355
MARISHA: Souls also don't wash up on beaches, but
apparently they do.

904
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:33,208
TALIESIN: That may be the most interesting thing I
think you've ever said, is souls don't grow on

905
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,314
trees.

906
01:13:34,314 --> 01:13:36,586
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Souls don't grow on trees!

907
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:39,783
MARISHA: At least he knows the dangers of
monocultures. This is very impressive.

908
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:42,213
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is, there's a lot of
variety.

909
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:43,734
TRAVIS: What?

910
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:48,484
MATT: What're you guys doing?

911
01:13:48,484 --> 01:13:52,514
LIAM: Vax is off on his own, by the way, sitting
on his ass having a moment, because it wasn't too

912
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:57,247
long ago when he had a thing for Sarenrae, and
that was pretty bittersweet so he's staring off

913
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,613
into space.

914
01:13:58,613 --> 01:14:00,517
MATT: Okay.

915
01:14:00,517 --> 01:14:07,254
TRAVIS: One piece of fruit? One piece, just one
little piece. An apple.

916
01:14:07,254 --> 01:14:09,443
SAM: No.

917
01:14:09,443 --> 01:14:12,228
TRAVIS: We're in Elysium! Oh my god, please.

918
01:14:12,228 --> 01:14:15,773
TALIESIN: If you do eat anything, and you
shouldn't, but if you do eat anything, eat

919
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:17,974
something you don't recognize, it'll be funnier
that way.

920
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:20,185
TRAVIS: Is there any fruit that I don't
recognize?

921
01:14:20,185 --> 01:14:21,815
MATT: Make an investigation check.

922
01:14:21,815 --> 01:14:23,374
TALIESIN: (deadpan) No, don't, stop.

923
01:14:23,374 --> 01:14:28,045
TRAVIS: Something I don't recognize. 12.

924
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:33,505
MATT: Yeah, actually, you guys walk for about
three or four minutes in the direction of where

925
01:14:33,505 --> 01:14:37,324
you saw the fortress, and you come across what
looks to be a small bush that's clustered near

926
01:14:37,324 --> 01:14:43,992
this dark wooden tree with a thick, gnarled
exterior, and this bush has these small ripe

927
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:47,081
plum-like fruits that come to a point at the
bottom that you've never seen before.

928
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:49,061
LAURA: Grog, do not. Do not.

929
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:51,050
TRAVIS: What? Pick this?

930
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,101
LAURA: Don't! (gasps)

931
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:53,268
MARISHA: (gasps) Grog!

932
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:54,650
TALIESIN: I dare you not to eat it.

933
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,841
MARISHA: Don't say that. He'll do it! You know
that's what happens!

934
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:00,090
TRAVIS: No, why don't we say, are you a person?

935
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,975
TALIESIN: (whispers) Grog.

936
01:15:02,975 --> 01:15:05,616
TRAVIS: Nothing? Nothing. You want to check it for
magic?

937
01:15:05,616 --> 01:15:10,778
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to check it. Hello, are you
a soul?

938
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:12,583
MARISHA: Yes, I'm a soul.

939
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:16,426
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god, it is a soul! It just
spoke to me. Oh my god. What's your favourite

940
01:15:16,426 --> 01:15:17,304
color?

941
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,639
MARISHA: Blue, like your feather.

942
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:28,945
LAURA: It said blue, like my feather! Did you hear
it? It was talking, Grog. It was talking.

943
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:31,311
TRAVIS: Hey, Pike?

944
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:33,553
ASHLEY: Don't eat it.

945
01:15:33,553 --> 01:15:34,426
TRAVIS: What?!

946
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:37,604
(laughter)

947
01:15:37,604 --> 01:15:39,074
ASHLEY: Just in case!

948
01:15:39,074 --> 01:15:41,970
TRAVIS: What do I do with it? I already picked
it!

949
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:48,544
ASHLEY: I have an idea! Why don't you hold onto
it. Keep it in your pouch.

950
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:52,533
LAURA: Not in the Bag of Holding, keep it in your
shirt pocket.

951
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:56,564
TRAVIS: When have I ever worn a shirt?

952
01:15:56,564 --> 01:16:03,292
ASHLEY: You can ask him if the fruit is edible,
and make sure it's not people.

953
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:10,878
TRAVIS: That's fair. All right. I will hold onto
the pointy plum.

954
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:12,894
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

955
01:16:12,894 --> 01:16:14,946
LAURA: Are we getting any closer to the citadel?

956
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,485
MATT: You guys keep walking towards it?

957
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:17,884
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Yeah.

958
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:19,692
MATT: All right, you walk on.

959
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:23,374
LAURA: Are there any people? Does it look like
there's tracks in this orchard?

960
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:33,169
MATT: Actually, Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, you notice
fairly quickly in that you begin to see movement

961
01:16:33,169 --> 01:16:39,947
ahead. The air itself, which by the way, the wind
here is carrying a very sweet and fragrant, almost

962
01:16:39,947 --> 01:16:45,654
like honey flower whiffs that come through in
waves that hit you, the whole atmosphere here

963
01:16:45,654 --> 01:16:53,380
makes you hungry, it makes you comfortable, it
reminds you of childhood in a strange way. It's a

964
01:16:53,380 --> 01:17:02,204
very good, positive atmosphere. You begin to see
as you approach, figures, moving. Pike, you

965
01:17:02,204 --> 01:17:06,787
recognize this because these are similar to the
vision you just had from Sarenrae. They are

966
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:16,854
entities. They are souls. They are people that
walk the fields of Elysium, and you see them walk

967
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:24,785
with small satchels, and you see them picking the
fruit. And gathering, and harvesting. They don't

968
01:17:24,785 --> 01:17:29,688
seem to pay you too much mind, and as you begin to
get close to some of them, they just stop and

969
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:35,925
watch you. It's very Spirited Away, in a strange
way. You see these somewhat translucent entities

970
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:39,957
that barely acknowledge your existence and then as
you pass by, they go on to whatever work they were

971
01:17:39,957 --> 01:17:44,698
doing. No speech, you don't even see eyes or
faces, you just see the outline of the human-like

972
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:46,787
shape, various heights and sizes.

973
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,756
LAURA: But they're picking the solid fruit?

974
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:50,378
MATT: They're picking the solid fruit, and
gathering them.

975
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:51,749
TALIESIN: Are they eating the solid fruit?

976
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:53,344
MATT: You don't see any of them immediately eating
it.

977
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:55,086
TALIESIN: None of them are eating the fruit.

978
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:56,693
MARISHA: I have a feeling it's an offering.

979
01:17:56,693 --> 01:18:00,220
TRAVIS: I have a feeling it's fucking fruit.

980
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,679
MARISHA: Are we getting closer?

981
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,559
MATT: You continue to walk and make sure to avoid
some of the larger clusters of these various

982
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:18,991
harvesting entities, these harvest souls. You,
who's leading the charge this time, who's leading

983
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:21,131
you through the orchards?

984
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:25,278
TALIESIN: One of you two. Is this technically
favored terrain for you?

985
01:18:25,278 --> 01:18:27,507
MATT: It would count as a forest for you.

986
01:18:27,507 --> 01:18:34,485
LAURA: Yeah? I guess I'll be in the front. Percy,
have you done a lot of talking to Pelor?

987
01:18:34,485 --> 01:18:37,189
TALIESIN: Not really, no.

988
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:42,525
MARISHA: Percy, how do you feel about gods these
days? Last time we talked we were both not

989
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:44,360
optimistic, I feel like.

990
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:51,705
TALIESIN: I know how to be polite. I'm very
reasonable at that.

991
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:55,347
MARISHA: Reverence.

992
01:18:55,347 --> 01:18:56,548
TALIESIN: Reverence.

993
01:18:56,548 --> 01:19:00,696
LIAM: You can certainly acknowledge when someone
can squash you like a bug.

994
01:19:00,696 --> 01:19:02,186
TALIESIN: Yes.

995
01:19:02,186 --> 01:19:10,480
MARISHA: But a lot of things can squish us like
bugs. I don't know, this is complicated. Let's

996
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,602
just keep going. I'm going to keep an eye out
while we're walking, for anything that resembles

997
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:17,307
the Sun Tree.

998
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:20,277
MATT: Okay. All right. Are you leading the way?

999
01:19:20,277 --> 01:19:21,287
LAURA: Yeah.

1000
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:27,217
MATT: Because you have no sun to keep tabs on,
you're just going to have to fly up above the

1001
01:19:27,217 --> 01:19:34,425
canopy and keep an eye on it, so you're cresting
and descending through the orchard as you

1002
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:40,823
progress. You travel for about an hour and a half
to two hours, and you notice you are getting

1003
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:47,854
closer, but it is a long way away, you probably
have another three, four hours of travel before

1004
01:19:47,854 --> 01:19:49,549
you get there on foot.

1005
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:52,246
LAURA: It's a long trek. We've got a while.

1006
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:55,044
MARISHA: I wonder if we believe harder if we'll
get there quicker.

1007
01:19:55,044 --> 01:19:58,248
TALIESIN: I don't believe that'll work.

1008
01:19:58,248 --> 01:20:02,837
SAM: Well, let's just go.

1009
01:20:02,837 --> 01:20:05,478
LAURA: Just keep on pushing on?

1010
01:20:05,478 --> 01:20:07,752
SAM: Yeah.

1011
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:12,919
LAURA: Right? We don't have anything that'll make us
move faster?

1012
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:15,514
TALIESIN: Well, we have misty, but that seems--

1013
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:16,857
LAURA: That seems stupid.

1014
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:18,625
TALIESIN: It's a nice walk.

1015
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:19,997
LAURA: Yeah, it's beautiful.

1016
01:20:19,997 --> 01:20:28,368
MATT: You guys continue your trek, and as you get
closer and closer to the fortress of the sun, you

1017
01:20:28,368 --> 01:20:39,502
do notice the trees of the orchard grow taller and
thicker. And it's like whatever fertility

1018
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:43,624
enchantment that runs this section of the plane,
the closer to the central portion of this fortress

1019
01:20:43,624 --> 01:20:52,129
you get, the more the rampant wild growth seems to
gather and expand to the point where it, in some

1020
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:58,991
places, almost resembles the Feywild, though
nowhere near as mysterious and threatening in some

1021
01:20:58,991 --> 01:21:07,191
cases. But you've never seen apple trees that
grow four stories tall. But here you see them.

1022
01:21:07,191 --> 01:21:13,651
And the scale is immense but the branches are as
dense with apples and leaves as they would be

1023
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:20,971
elsewhere. It continues to go. It's an impossible
size to some of these trees and plants and bushes.

1024
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:26,726
It dwarfs your size by comparison to where you
really get a sense of scale of how small you may

1025
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:30,933
be in this realm versus some of the creatures that
call it home.

1026
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:38,155
MARISHA: See, this tree can squash me like a bug.
If it fell on me, yeah.

1027
01:21:38,155 --> 01:21:44,511
LAURA: I wonder if its apple grew as big as the
actual tree. If it fell, you'd be doomed.

1028
01:21:44,511 --> 01:21:53,835
MATT: As you progress, a few more hours into this
trek, eventually, Vex, you begin to notice the

1029
01:21:53,835 --> 01:21:56,581
light ahead begins to grow brighter.

1030
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:58,635
LAURA: Hey, I think we're getting closer.

1031
01:21:58,635 --> 01:22:00,423
SAM: Awesome.

1032
01:22:00,423 --> 01:22:05,342
MARISHA: Does this feel like sunlight? Does it
register like sunlight or is it a whiter light?

1033
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:07,450
LAURA: Like should we put some sunblock on as we
walk towards it?

1034
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,652
MARISHA: Yeah? Is it sunlight temperature?

1035
01:22:09,652 --> 01:22:12,117
MATT: It registers as a sunlight. It is a pure
light.

1036
01:22:12,117 --> 01:22:15,780
TALIESIN: Like kitchen light white or like reading
room light?

1037
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,708
MATT: Like noon daylight light.

1038
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:24,671
TRAVIS: Arizona or California?

1039
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:30,980
MATT: And as you push closer and closer to where
this brightness continues to expand, and it's

1040
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:43,404
brighter than you anticipated. You're getting to
the edge of a clearing where the tree line comes to

1041
01:22:43,404 --> 01:22:49,462
a halt, but as you do, it hurts your eyes a little
bit. You have to adjust from the dark interior of

1042
01:22:49,462 --> 01:22:56,233
the forest to the outside. And as you finally
breach the edge of the tree line and look out, you

1043
01:22:56,233 --> 01:23:02,342
can see this open clearing, and immediately you
can see the column of light that's cracking down

1044
01:23:02,342 --> 01:23:08,646
from the center of the sky is what is lining this
clearing; where the light touches, the trees stop.

1045
01:23:08,646 --> 01:23:16,319
And it hurts a little bit to look at it because
the light is reflecting off of this bright gold

1046
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:23,340
brass-colored citadel before you. You thought the
crystal structure that Sarenrae was in was, you

1047
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:29,752
know, impressive. This is four times larger than
the largest structures in Vasselheim or Emon

1048
01:23:29,752 --> 01:23:41,283
you've ever encountered. And you watch as this
massive citadel-- It has maybe two dozen separate

1049
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:45,715
towers of different heights that stagger and shift
and they all come to these steeple-like points.

1050
01:23:45,715 --> 01:23:51,616
And there in the center of the structure is one
thick, massive tower that crawls upward and upward

1051
01:23:51,616 --> 01:24:01,438
and upward and upward for, even at this point,
surmising 15, 20 stories before the tip vanishes

1052
01:24:01,438 --> 01:24:06,644
into the bright light that is descending from the
sky above. You see the outline of a few sparse

1053
01:24:06,644 --> 01:24:13,282
trees that catch your attention. You do see some
trees that litter this open space within this

1054
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:17,954
bright light that are of the same type of tree as
the Sun Tree that resides in the center of

1055
01:24:17,954 --> 01:24:19,202
Whitestone.

1056
01:24:19,202 --> 01:24:21,140
MARISHA: He does have a twin.

1057
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:29,581
LAURA: Do you think this tower is compensating for
something, or maybe it's a representation. Hard to

1058
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:31,049
tell.

1059
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:35,620
TRAVIS: Basically we'll know Vecna's a god if
another skyscraper forms in Elysium somewhere.

1060
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:40,238
MARISHA: How close are we to the column of light?

1061
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:45,291
MATT: You're stepping beyond the treeline and into
the light, so you're just at the edge of the tree

1062
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,031
line.

1063
01:24:46,031 --> 01:24:52,014
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little twig and hold it
into the light column.

1064
01:24:52,014 --> 01:24:54,143
MATT: Okay. Doesn't seem to affect it at all.

1065
01:24:54,143 --> 01:24:57,941
MARISHA: Nothing? I'm going to touch it.

1066
01:24:57,941 --> 01:25:01,654
MATT: It's warm. It's like warm daylight.

1067
01:25:01,654 --> 01:25:03,669
MARISHA: Okay, we're not going to die.

1068
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:04,695
LAURA: That's good.

1069
01:25:04,695 --> 01:25:05,812
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

1070
01:25:05,812 --> 01:25:06,880
MARISHA: No.

1071
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:12,594
LAURA: (laughs) I'm going to look at the citadel
with my eyes wide open for five seconds, and then

1072
01:25:12,594 --> 01:25:15,622
close my eyes really fast to see if I can see
better details of it like when you look at the

1073
01:25:15,622 --> 01:25:16,634
sun.

1074
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:18,580
MATT: (laughs) You do, actually!

1075
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,842
LIAM: I swat my sister in the forehead.

1076
01:25:20,842 --> 01:25:25,111
LAURA: Hey, I'm doing stuff here; it's science.

1077
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:31,804
MATT: In closing your eyes, yeah, you can see the
shape and the outline of the spires that go off,

1078
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:35,497
and you can see the plating and the large, heavy
structures. And you can see the various windows

1079
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:39,515
that dot the outside on multiple levels. It looks
like there's at least seven or eight different

1080
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:46,441
levels of the actual fortress. You see lines of
windows and looks to be balconies that adorn it at

1081
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,846
these different stages. And at the top of that,
the towers go higher and higher. It's almost like

1082
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:56,115
a city of a fortress in its own right in its
scale. It's impressive. It's like if you took part

1083
01:25:56,115 --> 01:26:00,585
of the City of Brass and jammed it into one
structure and made it pure gold.

1084
01:26:00,585 --> 01:26:05,442
TRAVIS: Pure gold?

1085
01:26:05,442 --> 01:26:06,984
MATT: It's gorgeous.

1086
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:09,237
LAURA: This is beautiful!

1087
01:26:09,237 --> 01:26:11,858
MATT: (laughs) But it does burn the shit out of
your eyes if you stare at it that long.

1088
01:26:11,858 --> 01:26:19,837
LAURA: Worth it! Worth every second! I like Pelor.
I like him a lot.

1089
01:26:19,837 --> 01:26:23,530
TRAVIS: Someone should go in and test out the
light.

1090
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,141
SAM: Yeah, let's just go in. It's just light.

1091
01:26:26,141 --> 01:26:28,355
MARISHA: Maybe the light will take us there,
straight to him.

1092
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,696
TRAVIS: I push Vax in.

1093
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:30,755
MARISHA: I jump in.

1094
01:26:30,755 --> 01:26:33,976
MATT: You push Vax in? All right.

1095
01:26:33,976 --> 01:26:35,614
LIAM: Oh, warm again!

1096
01:26:35,614 --> 01:26:38,125
(laughter)

1097
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:47,235
MATT: It's very warm. And with your dark leather
it's like the goth kid in summer. Little sweaty.

1098
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:50,592
LIAM: I was never the goth kid.

1099
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:58,520
MATT: You guys begin to make your way on foot,
trekking towards the center of this clearing,

1100
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:11,180
towards the fortress of the sun. As you begin to
make your way beyond the various trees with their

1101
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:17,796
blossoming, beautiful white, pink, and purple
blossoms that mark the Sun Tree during the spring

1102
01:27:17,796 --> 01:27:25,879
and summer, you can now see along the perimeter of
this what appear to be hundreds of figures.

1103
01:27:25,879 --> 01:27:30,750
Hundreds of figures that just dot the outside of
the fortress. And as you get a better look at some of

1104
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:36,043
the spires you can see that on the upper levels,
including the one central tower, you can see these

1105
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:42,619
beautiful medallion-like circles of stained glass,
mosaics of color on a scale that is impressive.

1106
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:48,269
You can only surmise maybe the smallest one being
20 feet in diameter and going up from there on the

1107
01:27:48,269 --> 01:27:53,877
scale on the central portions of it. And what's
interesting is, usually with stained glass the bright

1108
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:59,960
exterior, the color is darkened and shaded because
the light is once you're inside the structure, but

1109
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:06,249
the color is so vibrant in the stained glass, you
get the sense that there is a light source within

1110
01:28:06,249 --> 01:28:11,162
the actual fortress that is as bright if not
brighter than the column of light that is

1111
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,920
descending from the sky.

1112
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,021
LAURA: Should've worn sunglasses here.

1113
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:23,061
MATT: As you begin to get closer and closer to the
citadel, once again the scale seems to build and

1114
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:28,600
build. What should seem to be a shorter walk gets
longer and longer as you begin to see how massive

1115
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:34,774
and far away this is, compared to where you
thought it was. And about 30 minutes since you

1116
01:28:34,774 --> 01:28:41,252
left the treeline, you begin to just get past the
final bit of Sun Trees that are planted around the

1117
01:28:41,252 --> 01:28:42,353
exterior.

1118
01:28:42,353 --> 01:28:45,813
MARISHA: I touch a few as I walk by. See if I feel
anything.

1119
01:28:45,813 --> 01:28:51,883
MATT: They're alive, they're vibrant and similar
in texture as to the one you've spoken with in

1120
01:28:51,883 --> 01:28:53,249
Whitestone.

1121
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:55,657
LAURA: You going to try talking to them?

1122
01:28:55,657 --> 01:28:57,307
MARISHA: Should I?

1123
01:28:57,307 --> 01:28:58,875
LAURA and TALIESIN: I don't know.

1124
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,439
TRAVIS: Do you know this tree?

1125
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:05,061
MARISHA: I don't know. Maybe he's like a distant
relative of the Sun Tree. Maybe I know him by

1126
01:29:05,061 --> 01:29:06,232
proxy.

1127
01:29:06,232 --> 01:29:10,970
LAURA: Maybe they're like, oh yeah, Sun Tree I
remember him, he got taken away as a seedling, but

1128
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:13,285
he was really great. How's he doing?

1129
01:29:13,285 --> 01:29:16,275
LIAM: I mean, you know you want to.

1130
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:19,160
TRAVIS: It's an Elysium tree, just saying.

1131
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,772
LAURA: Maybe they don't even speak our language.
It's possible.

1132
01:29:21,772 --> 01:29:24,944
LIAM: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,
Kiki.

1133
01:29:24,944 --> 01:29:29,200
MARISHA: I'll try and speak to one of the Sun
Trees that looks the most friendly.

1134
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,477
TRAVIS: (laughing) Amicable tree.

1135
01:29:30,477 --> 01:29:37,155
MATT: Make a nature check. See which one seems the
most approachable of all the other trees.

1136
01:29:37,155 --> 01:29:39,442
TRAVIS: Weigh the nuts.

1137
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:43,675
MARISHA: That's a natural one. I don't know.

1138
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:48,306
MATT: You see one tree that looks definitely the
most amiable of the ones in the field and you

1139
01:29:48,306 --> 01:29:49,486
approach it.

1140
01:29:49,486 --> 01:29:50,485
MARISHA: Amiable?

1141
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,706
MATT: Amicable. Pick your term.

1142
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:58,979
MARISHA: Amicable, amiable. All right, I'll talk
to a tree. That's what I'm going to do.

1143
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:04,833
MATT: As you finish your spell and reach out, your
finger touching the warm exterior of the tree. The

1144
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:07,995
light's still a little blinding, but you've
adjusted to it now, where you can make out shapes

1145
01:30:07,995 --> 01:30:13,476
and color, as opposed to the blaring white. What
do you say?

1146
01:30:13,476 --> 01:30:26,187
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree bro. Are you a Sun Tree
bro? Are you a Sun Tree brother? What's your

1147
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:27,447
name?

1148
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:35,963
MATT: "I'm a tree of the sun. And I'm not your
bro."

1149
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:43,498
MARISHA: No, I didn't know if you knew the Sun
Tree that grew in Whitestone on the Prime Material

1150
01:30:43,498 --> 01:30:45,293
Plane. I didn't know if you knew him.

1151
01:30:45,293 --> 01:30:48,298
MATT: "So because I'm a tree of the sun, you
assume that I know all other trees of the sun. Is

1152
01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:57,610
"that what this is? It's one of those things? We
all look alike, don't we? Just all of us trees of

1153
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,335
"the sun, right?"

1154
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:04,916
MARISHA: Can you tell me a little about this
plane? How do we talk to Pelor? How do we see

1155
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:06,217
him?

1156
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:11,108
MATT: "I recommend probably going towards the
giant golden fortress that is right behind you.

1157
01:31:11,108 --> 01:31:13,927
"It's probably a good place to look, where all the
light's coming from."

1158
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:24,760
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. Wow. I have a friend who wants to
know about the fruit. He's wondering if the fruit

1159
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:29,697
is souls? If he can eat the fruit.

1160
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:32,739
MATT: "The fruit is not souls! It's fruit."

1161
01:31:32,739 --> 01:31:35,058
TRAVIS: Vindication!

1162
01:31:35,058 --> 01:31:43,382
MATT: "The Dawnfather is the god of the harvest.
Good luck. Sorry if I came off a bit brusque. It's

1163
01:31:43,382 --> 01:31:45,884
"been a long time since anyone's talked to me."

1164
01:31:45,884 --> 01:31:49,089
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend
you.

1165
01:31:49,089 --> 01:31:51,506
MATT: "Apology accepted."

1166
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:55,008
MARISHA: Would you like a hug?

1167
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:58,447
MATT: "No. I would most definitely not like a
hug."

1168
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:08,571
MARISHA: Okay. Well, it was wonderful meeting you.
Absolutely. Thank you. All right, bye. Okay, bye.

1169
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:11,515
MATT: "Good day."

1170
01:32:11,515 --> 01:32:15,189
TALIESIN: What a beautiful tree you've found. It
casts so much shade.

1171
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:21,185
(laughter)

1172
01:32:21,185 --> 01:32:22,588
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh my god.

1173
01:32:22,588 --> 01:32:25,052
MARISHA: You were waiting the whole time to use
that, weren't you? The whole conversation.

1174
01:32:25,052 --> 01:32:29,330
TALIESIN: I was just sitting, like knitting,
crochet?

1175
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:37,577
MATT: As soon as you rolled that one, I was like
okay, then.

1176
01:32:37,577 --> 01:32:43,215
SAM: New NPC: Dick Tree.

1177
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:45,743
(laughter)

1178
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:53,719
MATT: It's more ornery than anything. (laughs)
All right, as Keyleth returns from her

1179
01:32:53,719 --> 01:32:56,442
conversation with the tree.

1180
01:32:56,442 --> 01:33:03,026
LIAM: You don't seem as blissed out as you
normally do. Did it go okay?

1181
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:12,480
MARISHA: Yeah, it was fine. Just can't talk to
everybody, I guess. It's fine.

1182
01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:14,837
TRAVIS: What did you ask him?

1183
01:33:14,837 --> 01:33:21,222
MARISHA: Nothing. Just asked if he knew the Sun
Tree, and he got super offended. You know what?

1184
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:22,914
Let's just go.

1185
01:33:22,914 --> 01:33:26,383
TALIESIN: You've never been rejected by a tree
before, have you?

1186
01:33:26,383 --> 01:33:31,787
MARISHA: No, I have never been rejected by a tree.
Most trees like me. People don't like me, but at

1187
01:33:31,787 --> 01:33:34,670
least trees do, except for this asshole.

1188
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:42,540
LIAM: I start to smooth out her mantle, which is
wiring up like a cat's.

1189
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:46,519
MARISHA: My leaves are prickly.

1190
01:33:46,519 --> 01:33:49,487
LAURA: Maybe he was just pretending he didn't like
you because he felt uncomfortable because he likes

1191
01:33:49,487 --> 01:33:52,356
you so much. Like Kash!

1192
01:33:52,356 --> 01:34:00,274
MARISHA: That's nice, Vex. Thanks. You didn't talk
to this guy, okay? You don't know.

1193
01:34:00,274 --> 01:34:02,517
TRAVIS: Did you ask about the fruit?

1194
01:34:02,517 --> 01:34:07,435
MARISHA: Yeah, he said it's fruit. It's fine. You
can eat it, too. You're right, Grog. You were

1195
01:34:07,435 --> 01:34:11,214
right! Eat the fruit! Let's go! Come on.

1196
01:34:11,214 --> 01:34:13,545
SAM: Yikes.

1197
01:34:13,545 --> 01:34:15,557
LAURA: Breathe in, breathe out.

1198
01:34:15,557 --> 01:34:24,984
MATT: All right, you guys begin making your trek
back towards the Fortress of the Sun. As you're

1199
01:34:24,984 --> 01:34:26,288
walking--

1200
01:34:26,288 --> 01:34:29,609
MARISHA: I rip off an apple as I go, and I start
aggressively eating it.

1201
01:34:29,609 --> 01:34:32,456
MATT: The Sun Trees here don't bear fruit.

1202
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:35,213
MARISHA: I fucking spike an apple that I had
earlier!

1203
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:37,829
MATT: Okay. If you have an apple with you, you're
welcome to eat it if you wanted to.

1204
01:34:37,829 --> 01:34:40,901
MARISHA: No! I just want to go in the tower.

1205
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:46,870
LIAM: I lean over to Percival and say, this is one
of those times when it's best just to keep quiet.

1206
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:50,739
TALIESIN: I'm so quietly delighted by this.

1207
01:34:50,739 --> 01:34:58,458
MATT: All right. As you guys begin to approach the
fortress, you watch as those hundreds of figures

1208
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:03,886
you saw at the base are beginning to collect
towards the front of what appears to be the large

1209
01:35:03,886 --> 01:35:07,934
doors that lead to this side's entrance to the
actual structure. As they gather, they begin to

1210
01:35:07,934 --> 01:35:12,008
push in your direction. You also see other figures
up on the higher floors, balconies, almost.

1211
01:35:12,008 --> 01:35:18,033
(wingbeat, whoosh) Glide and then flying in your
direction rather rapidly.

1212
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:23,477
LAURA: I hope they're friendly. He's definitely
not as solitary as Sarenrae, is he?

1213
01:35:23,477 --> 01:35:28,835
MATT: At this point, you watch as these winged
entities, three of them, approach faster than the

1214
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:35,856
rest of the horde that seems to be pushing in your
direction. You can see long, golden-white wings.

1215
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:46,486
You see very intense-looking breastplates made of
gold and brass, with rubies marked into it.

1216
01:35:46,486 --> 01:35:53,375
Similar, but not as well adorned as the armor that
Pike wears. Holding spears, various other weapons

1217
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:58,261
or shields, but as they fly in and land, (impact
noise) landing. They all stand about five or six

1218
01:35:58,261 --> 01:36:03,829
feet taller than all of you. Humanoid, muscular,
almost Roman in physique, but their skin is a very

1219
01:36:03,829 --> 01:36:06,887
faint light blue. Their eyes are white.

1220
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:09,771
LAURA: Hunin and Kyor!

1221
01:36:09,771 --> 01:36:13,445
MARISHA: Are they devas? Celestials?

1222
01:36:13,445 --> 01:36:16,762
Angels!

1223
01:36:16,762 --> 01:36:18,160
LIAM: Celestials.

1224
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:25,641
MATT: They have similar traits, though apparently
purer and much stronger than the half-blood

1225
01:36:25,641 --> 01:36:28,286
celestials that you had met previously in the City
of Brass.

1226
01:36:28,286 --> 01:36:31,507
LAURA: That we rescued. Didn't just meet them. We
saved them.

1227
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:36,027
MATT: You did, and you gave them a new life under
the remaining family of--

1228
01:36:36,027 --> 01:36:39,595
LAURA: Hunin and Kyor. I even got their fucking
names right!

1229
01:36:39,595 --> 01:36:41,087
MATT: You did, which is awesome.

1230
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,550
LIAM: The third time, yeah.

1231
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:49,138
MATT: So as the three of them land (impacts)
around you, spears not aggressive, but at their

1232
01:36:49,138 --> 01:36:55,599
side, and powerful entities. They triangulate
around you, all standing so much taller than you

1233
01:36:55,599 --> 01:37:02,947
do, their wings still unfurled in a very prominent
display of power. Their helmets covering everything--

1234
01:37:02,947 --> 01:37:08,902
the helmet comes down over the nose and reveals
the eyes. It's very Roman in structure. One of

1235
01:37:08,902 --> 01:37:14,694
them yells out, "You who approaches the fortress.
What is your business here?"

1236
01:37:14,694 --> 01:37:17,378
TRAVIS: Guards. Best to let Scanlan and I take
this.

1237
01:37:17,378 --> 01:37:20,517
(laughter)

1238
01:37:20,517 --> 01:37:23,571
LIAM: Percy, do you want to flash a little
Whitestone bling, at the moment?

1239
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:27,029
TALIESIN: You're pretty Whitestone blinged.

1240
01:37:27,029 --> 01:37:32,178
LAURA: We're Vox Machina. We were sent here to
speak to Pelor by the goddess Sarenrae.

1241
01:37:32,178 --> 01:37:35,758
MATT: "Sarenrae sent you?"

1242
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:37,597
LAURA: Yes, she did.

1243
01:37:37,597 --> 01:37:39,448
MATT: "With what business?"

1244
01:37:39,448 --> 01:37:43,846
LAURA: To speak about a very big evil growing on
the Material Plane.

1245
01:37:43,846 --> 01:37:46,850
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1246
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:56,275
LAURA: Oh no. Okay. 22?

1247
01:37:56,275 --> 01:38:04,960
MATT: Okay. The one guard that you were talking to
looks over to the guard that's to the left of all

1248
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,807
of you, and he gives him this slight head nudge.
That one, who's a little bit smaller than the other

1249
01:38:09,807 --> 01:38:17,148
two, walks past and his pupil-less white eyes,
which emanate this faint white glow, seem to look

1250
01:38:17,148 --> 01:38:23,458
past each of you. I say past each of you. It
almost is a piercing gaze. As it looks at Scanlan,

1251
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:36,475
it gives a little bit of an upturn of the nose. A
neutral disapproval of Percival. Keyleth, less so.

1252
01:38:36,475 --> 01:38:49,237
Grog, almost a sneer for a moment. And then to Vax
and Vex. And then to Pike, a nod.

1253
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:50,924
SAM: Oh, a nod.

1254
01:38:50,924 --> 01:38:52,509
LAURA: She's good.

1255
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:57,425
MATT: He looks back to the first guard, and says,
"There is no evil among them."

1256
01:38:57,425 --> 01:39:02,529
LAURA: Hear that, Grog? You're not evil.

1257
01:39:02,529 --> 01:39:04,889
TRAVIS: Yeah, I knew that. Why didn't you just
ask?

1258
01:39:04,889 --> 01:39:12,344
TALIESIN: We do, it should be noted, carry a
dangerous artifact that we should warn you of.

1259
01:39:12,344 --> 01:39:14,919
SAM: Check in our weapons. Yeah.

1260
01:39:14,919 --> 01:39:21,067
MATT: The one soldier that you were first speaking
to steps forward, his heavy footfalls from his

1261
01:39:21,067 --> 01:39:24,282
armored boots. He puts his hand out. "We will take
this artifact."

1262
01:39:24,282 --> 01:39:27,820
LAURA and SAM: (hesitant noises) Will we get it
back?

1263
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:32,170
MATT: "What need do you have with a dangerous
artifact?"

1264
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:38,861
LAURA: Well, it belongs to the great evil, and so
it's possible that we can use it to defeat him, so

1265
01:39:38,861 --> 01:39:41,539
if we don't have it, we might not be able to do
that.

1266
01:39:41,539 --> 01:39:43,348
TRAVIS: It may give us an advantage.

1267
01:39:43,348 --> 01:39:44,899
LAURA: Could be really great.

1268
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:46,680
MATT: "The Dawnfather will be the judge of that."

1269
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,701
LAURA: Okay.

1270
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:49,209
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

1271
01:39:49,209 --> 01:39:57,192
SAM: Don't look at it, though. It'll turn you
super evil, and you'll rip out your eye.

1272
01:39:57,192 --> 01:40:06,269
MATT: "Noted." Such a big thing, and yet you shook
it a little, strangely. "Very well. Follow us,

1273
01:40:06,269 --> 01:40:07,210
"please."

1274
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,018
SAM: How's that fruit?

1275
01:40:09,018 --> 01:40:15,789
MATT: Their wings fold behind them, and they walk
alongside you, matching their gait to yours. As

1276
01:40:15,789 --> 01:40:20,112
you move forward, even with your brisk pace, their
gait is so long that they're having to make long,

1277
01:40:20,112 --> 01:40:23,782
slow strides to keep up with your slow pace.

1278
01:40:23,782 --> 01:40:26,218
LAURA: I hold Percy's hand as we're going in.

1279
01:40:26,218 --> 01:40:30,709
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll do this together. I'm all
right.

1280
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:37,550
MATT: At this point, the mass army that's been
approaching you, you can see now, are hundreds of

1281
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:46,250
armored spirits, similar to those that you saw in
the orchard. As they approach, the three planar

1282
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:51,881
entities that are walking alongside you put their
hand up in a dismissive motion, and the army

1283
01:40:51,881 --> 01:40:57,524
parts, leaving a singular path that leads you
right to the front of the fortress. And the path,

1284
01:40:57,524 --> 01:41:02,293
because there's so many, goes on. It's like
walking through a parade of silence. As you all

1285
01:41:02,293 --> 01:41:07,637
look around, you can't make out any faces. You see
hundreds of sets of glittering golden armor with

1286
01:41:07,637 --> 01:41:14,743
the somewhat-visible form of these translucent
spiritual entities that take up the space. You

1287
01:41:14,743 --> 01:41:20,913
don't sense any hostility, animosity. You don't
sense any welcoming. You don't sense anything from

1288
01:41:20,913 --> 01:41:23,203
them. They're present and letting you pass.

1289
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:24,761
LAURA: Is the armor solid?

1290
01:41:24,761 --> 01:41:32,181
MATT: Yes, the armor is solid, and the spirits
that inhabit them are pseudo-material. It's hard

1291
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:36,042
for you to gauge; you haven't encountered this
type of creature outside of your spectral

1292
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:43,193
encounters with ghosts and other spirits. As you
step forward, being flanked and escorted by these

1293
01:41:43,193 --> 01:41:51,902
winged guards, you are brought to the base of the
50 or so steps that ascend to the front 40-foot-tall

1294
01:41:51,902 --> 01:42:01,929
double doors that now (loud creaking) creak
open to reveal the interior of the palace, which

1295
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:08,584
is as bright, if not brighter from the inside as
the outside pillar of light you're leaving.

1296
01:42:08,584 --> 01:42:15,493
As you prepare yourselves to adjust your gaze, you
ascend step by step to eventually take in whatever

1297
01:42:15,493 --> 01:42:19,393
the interior of the Fortress of the Sun has to
offer. And that's where we're going to take our

1298
01:42:19,393 --> 01:42:26,333
break! We're going to return back here in a few
minutes. We're going to use the restroom and get

1299
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:28,999
snacks and stuff. You guys can rest here for a
minute. We have a giveaway.

1300
01:42:28,999 --> 01:42:31,203
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fruit.

1301
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:33,127
TALIESIN: Don't eat the spiky bit.

1302
01:42:33,127 --> 01:42:35,476
MATT: That's right. Make a wisdom saving throw
real fast.

1303
01:42:35,476 --> 01:42:36,443
TRAVIS: Really?

1304
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:38,053
MARISHA: Wait, really?

1305
01:42:38,053 --> 01:42:39,122
MATT: Yeah.

1306
01:42:39,122 --> 01:42:40,279
LIAM: Everybody?

1307
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,603
LAURA: No, just Grog, because he's an idiot.

1308
01:42:42,603 --> 01:42:43,884
TRAVIS: 13.

1309
01:42:43,884 --> 01:42:46,233
MATT: 13. Okay, good to know. All right.

1310
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:50,363
MARISHA: Maybe you would have gotten smarter.
Maybe it's super fruit. Maybe it's acai berries.

1311
01:42:50,363 --> 01:42:56,579
MATT: All right, so our friends at Wyrmwood have
this awesome black walnut personal dice tray with

1312
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:01,600
a leather interior. It's pretty badass. We'll only
have one lucky winner over in the Twitch chat. The

1313
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:08,531
key word for tonight is latency. L-A-T-E-N-C-Y.
Like the kind that you get when you have two

1314
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:13,176
people on Skype guesting in. So to win this, find
your way over to Twitch chat, follow the

1315
01:43:13,176 --> 01:43:16,324
instructions, and when it's time, put the word
'latency' in, and one lucky winner at the end of the

1316
01:43:16,324 --> 01:43:20,480
break we'll be able to give this away to and
announce. Enjoy, rest. We'll see you guys back

1317
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,576
here in a few minutes.

1318
01:43:22,576 --> 02:02:41,084
[break]

1319
02:02:41,136 --> 02:02:44,688
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. First and foremost, the winner of

1320
02:02:44,688 --> 02:02:48,695
the chatroom contest-- and I hope I'm reading this
right-- is n-nailhammer.

1321
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:51,152
(laughter)

1322
02:02:51,152 --> 02:02:52,354
TRAVIS: Wait, one more time.

1323
02:02:52,354 --> 02:02:53,755
MATT: Nnailhammer.

1324
02:02:53,755 --> 02:02:55,169
TALIESIN: Is it Nine Inch Nail hammer?

1325
02:02:55,169 --> 02:03:03,598
MATT: It's two N's, ailhammer. So nnailhammer.
Congratulations, nnailhammer. You won the

1326
02:03:03,598 --> 02:03:12,134
giveaway. Denobo will contact you and get you the
info. Congratulations! All right, so back in to

1327
02:03:12,134 --> 02:03:14,075
where we left off.

1328
02:03:14,075 --> 02:03:24,287
As you ascend the remainder of the stairs and step
into the entryway to the Fortress of the Sun,

1329
02:03:24,287 --> 02:03:31,837
you're led through a series of gorgeous silver and
gold archways, dozens of feet above you. The

1330
02:03:31,837 --> 02:03:38,323
intricacies of the interior, scrolling trim and
inlay across every wall, pillar, and bannister is

1331
02:03:38,323 --> 02:03:46,210
incredible. Not gaudy, just magnificent in purpose
and history. Glancing across the marble floor, you

1332
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:52,150
can see the construction here is immaculate. There
isn't any sort of smudge or damage dealt anywhere.

1333
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:59,186
These arches themselves, even as you glance over
and look, the detail seems to fractal smaller and

1334
02:03:59,186 --> 02:04:04,489
smaller, in places, where you can't imagine a
craftsman's hand could have built this. Only

1335
02:04:04,489 --> 02:04:09,777
through the will of a god could such a thing come
into creation on such a vast and minor scale.

1336
02:04:09,777 --> 02:04:20,820
You also notice as you walk in, there's no shadow
or shade. The walls seem to almost emanate light

1337
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:22,116
on their own.

1338
02:04:22,116 --> 02:04:23,515
MARISHA: I beg to differ.

1339
02:04:23,515 --> 02:04:25,290
MATT: The outside's a different story.

1340
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:26,482
MARISHA: Go to the courtyard.

1341
02:04:26,482 --> 02:04:28,109
LIAM: Just you wait!

1342
02:04:28,109 --> 02:04:30,860
LAURA: No shadow underneath us?

1343
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:36,175
MATT: No shadow underneath you. Looking around
you, and looking at your hands, you can see very

1344
02:04:36,175 --> 02:04:41,283
faint shadows can be cast between your fingers and
things that are very close, but it's like there's

1345
02:04:41,283 --> 02:04:45,620
a diffused light throughout the entirety of the
interior of the fortress that casts away any

1346
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:53,069
darkness or shadow. There's no umbra; there's no
place where light is absent. It is just light

1347
02:04:53,069 --> 02:04:54,282
everywhere.

1348
02:04:54,282 --> 02:05:03,370
You hear this soft music played, the deeper into
the fortress you get.

1349
02:05:03,370 --> 02:05:07,083
MARISHA: Club's over here, guys.

1350
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,350
MATT: Rocks fall; everybody dies.

1351
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:13,476
(laughter)

1352
02:05:13,476 --> 02:05:15,546
MATT: It's okay.

1353
02:05:15,546 --> 02:05:18,209
LIAM: Benny Hill music commences.

1354
02:05:18,209 --> 02:05:25,729
MATT: Soft music you hear playing throughout the
interior of the fortress, like this distant sound

1355
02:05:25,729 --> 02:05:31,635
of a thousand soft choir voices accompanying the
inspirational sight of the building that you now

1356
02:05:31,635 --> 02:05:38,740
walk through. You see other entities adorned in
armor, still opaque and pearlescent in their

1357
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:45,557
spirit form. Some of them have flowing robes of
gold and white that trail behind them and drift

1358
02:05:45,557 --> 02:05:47,597
across the floor silently.

1359
02:05:47,597 --> 02:05:54,007
The further in you walk, you begin to see where
some of these spires and spiral staircases twist

1360
02:05:54,007 --> 02:06:00,857
upward. The rooms have purpose in construction, but
the scale of those that walk through the halls is

1361
02:06:00,857 --> 02:06:07,627
so varied that you see staircases on large scales
and small scales. They almost seem to wrap around

1362
02:06:07,627 --> 02:06:13,022
each other in places. It's surreal, almost
Escher-esque in some of the interior

1363
02:06:13,022 --> 02:06:14,307
construction.

1364
02:06:14,307 --> 02:06:20,421
You see archways and doorways on different levels:
some that appear to be reached only by those that

1365
02:06:20,421 --> 02:06:26,608
can fly versus those that can just walk and climb.
Occasionally, you look up and you can see

1366
02:06:26,608 --> 02:06:34,907
skylights across the top: some open glass and
crystal, some appearing to be a small window of

1367
02:06:34,907 --> 02:06:40,388
stained glass that glitters down in bright blues,
purples, reds, oranges. There's definitely a

1368
02:06:40,388 --> 02:06:45,472
stained glass motif in a lot of the interior of
the fortress, which you've seen in some of Pelor's

1369
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:50,120
imagery, and the symbol around him is like a
circular stained glass structure that spirals in

1370
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,552
with the actual star and the sun in the center.

1371
02:06:52,552 --> 02:06:59,804
The music continues to grow louder and louder the
further in you walk, and you feel like you're

1372
02:06:59,804 --> 02:07:06,001
being led along for a good 15 minutes straight.
This structure, this hallway, just goes on and on,

1373
02:07:06,001 --> 02:07:12,047
the arches passing one after the other after the
other. Your eyes have adjusted to the brightness

1374
02:07:12,047 --> 02:07:20,067
of the interior now. Eventually, you come to
another set of large doors. These doors

1375
02:07:20,067 --> 02:07:30,650
themselves: no wood, no stone, just pure, vibrant
platinum and gold. The symbol upon them seems to

1376
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:36,490
be the same circular motif as the symbol of the
Dawnfather, with the star in the center, but the

1377
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:42,879
detail and intricacies. You get close, and your
eyes-- especially you, Vex and Vax-- you glance

1378
02:07:42,879 --> 02:07:49,771
and you can see, on every small scale, even just a
simple bar of the star and the sun has writing,

1379
02:07:49,771 --> 02:07:55,494
and has artwork, and then as you look closer, even
on a smaller scale, that writing is comprised of

1380
02:07:55,494 --> 02:08:03,511
smaller artwork and smaller writing. You're thrown
off by the level of detail and intricacy of this

1381
02:08:03,511 --> 02:08:11,681
place's construction. You're in awe. Your jaw
drops as these reveals seem to barrage you with

1382
02:08:11,681 --> 02:08:14,015
each step into the structure.

1383
02:08:14,015 --> 02:08:20,838
At that point, the doors (scraping noise) open,
and you wince once again, as the light that fills

1384
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:27,627
the room from the inside is near-blinding. You
close your eyes a bit, and all you hear is this

1385
02:08:27,627 --> 02:08:31,310
deep, resonant voice say, "Come."

1386
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:37,402
LAURA: This has to be Heaven. The doors just keep opening.

1387
02:08:37,402 --> 02:08:40,946
MARISHA: This must be the bright light that
everyone sees when they die.

1388
02:08:40,988 --> 02:08:43,881
TRAVIS: Don't steal his doors, or anything.

1389
02:08:43,881 --> 02:08:46,291
SAM: You want to steal the doors?

1390
02:08:46,291 --> 02:08:49,270
TRAVIS: What a terrible thing to say in the
presence of the Dawnfather.

1391
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:52,047
LIAM: (muffled) All right, one foot in front of
the other. Here we go.

1392
02:08:52,047 --> 02:08:54,368
SAM: Oh, we can't hear Liam.

1393
02:08:54,368 --> 02:08:57,437
LIAM: "One foot in front of the other. Here we
go," I said.

1394
02:08:57,437 --> 02:08:58,800
TALIESIN: Let's go.

1395
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:09,190
MATT: You shield your eyes, upon stepping into the
actual chamber, because otherwise, even closing

1396
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:15,332
your eyes isn't enough; the light is so intense.
It still hurts through your eyelids. As you step

1397
02:09:15,332 --> 02:09:20,874
inside and look off, you can now glance around the
interior of this chamber. The same level of

1398
02:09:20,874 --> 02:09:28,550
fractal-like scrolling detail you saw in the doors
lines every inch of the wall on the inside of this

1399
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:38,439
large, square chamber, hundreds of feet across on
each side. It's incredible. The floor is almost

1400
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:45,191
mirrored in its polish. Glancing down, while there
is no immediate shadow, behind you, the bright

1401
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:54,502
light does cast a bit behind you. You can see your
reflection almost perfectly in the polished floor

1402
02:09:54,502 --> 02:09:55,801
below.

1403
02:09:55,801 --> 02:10:03,255
You glance up, and you see the interior of that
giant steeple-like tower that's sat at the center

1404
02:10:03,255 --> 02:10:09,421
of the fortress in the distance, and you look up
almost endlessly. You can see floor after floor

1405
02:10:09,421 --> 02:10:22,252
with an endless spiral of various stained glass
structures and reliefs and small statues that

1406
02:10:22,252 --> 02:10:32,233
protrude from the edges, and this tower is
seemingly hollow, just leading up, and you can't

1407
02:10:32,233 --> 02:10:39,703
even make out the top of it from this distance. It
looks like a tower that is infinite, almost, from

1408
02:10:39,703 --> 02:10:41,688
this perspective, it's so big.

1409
02:10:41,688 --> 02:10:43,799
LAURA: Is the light coming from the tower?

1410
02:10:43,799 --> 02:10:48,153
MATT: No, the light's coming from the center of
the room. As your eyes slowly adjust and you

1411
02:10:48,153 --> 02:10:54,943
glance past your fingers and your hands, you see
there in the center of the chamber is a 25-foot

1412
02:10:54,943 --> 02:11:08,086
throne of gold, brass, silver, and ruby. Sitting
upon that throne sits a mighty being, wearing the

1413
02:11:08,086 --> 02:11:16,633
most intricate and beautiful golden plate armor
you've ever seen. Similar in detail and design as

1414
02:11:16,633 --> 02:11:22,382
the interior of the chamber around you, it almost
blends in if you didn't see it shift. A white

1415
02:11:22,382 --> 02:11:27,366
cloak encases the shoulders of this entity and
sways gently at their side like it's been brushed

1416
02:11:27,366 --> 02:11:33,876
off and dangles over one of the arm rests. And
where a head would be, instead there is a burning

1417
02:11:33,876 --> 02:11:39,633
star, so bright that you can only look but a
second before you have to avert your gaze and shut

1418
02:11:39,633 --> 02:11:45,492
your lids out of the pain. Just enough time to
barely make out the outline of what appears to be

1419
02:11:45,492 --> 02:11:55,616
a male head, almost featureless, burning within
the corona. This, you can only imagine, is the

1420
02:11:55,616 --> 02:11:59,635
Dawnfather himself, Pelor.

1421
02:11:59,635 --> 02:12:10,132
As you step into the chamber, the door (boom)
closes behind you, and the winged planar entities

1422
02:12:10,132 --> 02:12:17,692
that pushed you in are not in the chamber. It's
just you... and the Dawnfather.

1423
02:12:17,692 --> 02:12:20,765
SAM: Look how far we've come, guys.

1424
02:12:20,765 --> 02:12:22,904
(laughter)

1425
02:12:22,904 --> 02:12:25,765
SAM: From throwing shit at people...

1426
02:12:25,765 --> 02:12:29,103
LAURA: Didn't you do that just last week?

1427
02:12:29,103 --> 02:12:30,973
SAM: I did. I do that most weeks.

1428
02:12:30,973 --> 02:12:32,575
LAURA: Grog--

1429
02:12:32,575 --> 02:12:34,307
TRAVIS: Yes?

1430
02:12:34,307 --> 02:12:38,212
LAURA: Next time we visit the Dawnfather, wear
some underwear. This floor is like a mirror.

1431
02:12:38,212 --> 02:12:41,312
TRAVIS: But I don't ever-- oh, okay.

1432
02:12:41,312 --> 02:12:43,192
TALIESIN: What are you-- oh god.

1433
02:12:43,192 --> 02:12:48,263
SAM: Ooh! You mean I can-- oh, sorry.

1434
02:12:48,263 --> 02:12:52,444
(laughter)

1435
02:12:52,444 --> 02:12:53,773
MATT: "Vox Machina."

1436
02:12:53,773 --> 02:12:55,508
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1437
02:12:55,508 --> 02:12:59,183
(laughter)

1438
02:12:59,183 --> 02:13:02,064
TRAVIS: Little bit of pee comes out. A little
bit.

1439
02:13:02,064 --> 02:13:04,385
MARISHA: You guys, he knows our name.

1440
02:13:04,385 --> 02:13:12,743
MATT: "You come with purpose. I can sense your
determination. What would you tell me of your

1441
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:14,493
"purpose?"

1442
02:13:14,493 --> 02:13:19,213
TALIESIN: Vecna walks the earth.

1443
02:13:19,213 --> 02:13:23,610
MARISHA: We are here to prevent the coming of a
third Calamity.

1444
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:28,183
TRAVIS: We seek the means to destroy him and all
he stands for.

1445
02:13:28,183 --> 02:13:31,673
MARISHA: He seeks ascension into godhood.

1446
02:13:31,673 --> 02:13:40,204
LIAM: And all your children are in danger, and we
have begun communing with the gods. I extend

1447
02:13:40,204 --> 02:13:45,249
slowly the wings and bow my head in deference to
him.

1448
02:13:45,249 --> 02:13:59,717
TALIESIN: The Divergence is threatened. Your
guards, your creatures, have some of our proof in

1449
02:13:59,717 --> 02:14:02,614
their care, at the moment.

1450
02:14:02,614 --> 02:14:12,418
MATT: "Another seeks the path of the Matron of
Ravens. A flaw in our annihilation of her hubris.

1451
02:14:12,418 --> 02:14:22,543
"That it still exists is dire news. That it exists
in the hands of such a slippery, vile mortal as

1452
02:14:22,543 --> 02:14:36,409
"Vecna, even more so. I thank you for your haste in
sharing your findings. I shall ponder a strategy."

1453
02:14:36,409 --> 02:14:43,689
He leans back in his chair, brushes his hand like
this, and the doors behind you (boom) open.

1454
02:14:43,689 --> 02:15:04,755
LAURA: It was you that I was speaking to, in
Whitestone. I had no idea.

1455
02:15:04,803 --> 02:15:07,248
We have the eye of Vecna.

1456
02:15:07,248 --> 02:15:15,898
MATT: His form shifts a bit, seems to lean forward
on the throne, resting the bright, burning,

1457
02:15:15,898 --> 02:15:22,265
star-like head on the edge of his gauntleted fist,
leaning forward in your direction. You try and

1458
02:15:22,265 --> 02:15:28,690
glance up, but it hurts in the presence. "Present
the artifact."

1459
02:15:28,690 --> 02:15:32,055
SAM: Well, we gave it to--

1460
02:15:32,055 --> 02:15:33,643
LAURA: No, we still have it.

1461
02:15:33,643 --> 02:15:34,724
SAM: Oh, we do?

1462
02:15:34,724 --> 02:15:36,154
LAURA: Yeah, he kept it with us.

1463
02:15:36,154 --> 02:15:38,545
ASHLEY: Oh, I have it, actually.

1464
02:15:38,545 --> 02:15:43,155
SAM: Could you guys turn them up? We can't hear
them at all.

1465
02:15:43,155 --> 02:15:45,015
LAURA: Please.

1466
02:15:45,015 --> 02:15:47,970
MATT: So as you place the box on the ground--

1467
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:54,664
ASHLEY: I'll try to take it over-- I'm going to
leave it on the ground; it's a little hot over

1468
02:15:54,664 --> 02:15:55,954
there.

1469
02:15:55,954 --> 02:16:03,115
MATT: Okay. As you leave it on the ground, you
can't see his eyes, you can't see where he's

1470
02:16:03,115 --> 02:16:08,935
facing necessarily, but you can sense his
attention; it's like a beacon across the room.

1471
02:16:08,935 --> 02:16:13,725
It's ever-present, but there is definitely a focal
point that you can sense when it comes to you,

1472
02:16:13,725 --> 02:16:19,354
it's like having a spotlight on you amongst a
theater of thousands of people. It's intimidating,

1473
02:16:19,354 --> 02:16:28,504
but also exhilarating. The beacon shifts in the
direction of the small box you placed on the

1474
02:16:28,504 --> 02:16:34,812
ground. Immediately the box flips open, and you
watch as the eye levitates out on its own,

1475
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:43,056
twitching and looking around in all directions. It
has no lid to close, and the tiny slit-like iris

1476
02:16:43,056 --> 02:16:51,767
of it seems to retract best it can, in the
presence of such bright light. You hear this low,

1477
02:16:51,767 --> 02:16:59,542
ruminating (hums). "Do you have purpose with
this?"

1478
02:16:59,542 --> 02:17:04,076
SAM: Only if it can help us destroy Vecna.

1479
02:17:04,076 --> 02:17:08,289
MATT: "Do you know how this would help you destroy
Vecna?"

1480
02:17:08,289 --> 02:17:11,636
MARISHA: We don't know how to destroy Vecna.

1481
02:17:11,636 --> 02:17:13,642
TALIESIN: We seek knowledge and power.

1482
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:15,607
MARISHA: And assistance.

1483
02:17:15,607 --> 02:17:32,709
MATT: "I could destroy this right now, only if you
do not need it. Its existence is a threat. But the

1484
02:17:32,709 --> 02:17:36,241
"choice is yours, since you brought it before me."

1485
02:17:36,241 --> 02:17:42,146
LAURA: Do you know what help it would be to us on
the Material Plane?

1486
02:17:42,146 --> 02:17:47,237
MATT: He stares through you. The beacon finds
you.

1487
02:17:47,237 --> 02:17:52,877
MARISHA: It's not the only one in existence. There
are others.

1488
02:17:52,877 --> 02:17:55,989
TALIESIN: I think it might be, yes.

1489
02:17:55,989 --> 02:17:57,813
MARISHA: Right?

1490
02:17:57,813 --> 02:18:00,544
LIAM: That's his eye.

1491
02:18:00,544 --> 02:18:03,019
MATT: There are other people missing eyes, but
this is the only one--

1492
02:18:03,019 --> 02:18:05,986
LIAM: It's his. And it should be destroyed.

1493
02:18:05,986 --> 02:18:08,026
SAM: Right now?

1494
02:18:08,026 --> 02:18:20,483
LAURA: Maybe it'll make him weaker, if it is
destroyed. He obviously put it in his scion. We

1495
02:18:20,483 --> 02:18:25,449
destroy it, we keep someone else like Delilah
Briarwood from coming into power. Right?

1496
02:18:25,449 --> 02:18:28,137
TALIESIN: Yes, I think...

1497
02:18:28,137 --> 02:18:32,247
LAURA: I say destroy it.

1498
02:18:32,247 --> 02:18:38,078
LIAM: Delilah was obviously his pawn and she was
using it. Fuck it. Destroy it.

1499
02:18:38,078 --> 02:18:52,107
TALIESIN: We stand with... a master of the Grey
Hunt. She is the one who can speak for Whitestone

1500
02:18:52,107 --> 02:18:55,640
on that level. If you say destroy it, we destroy
it.

1501
02:18:55,640 --> 02:19:02,753
MATT: The beacon comes back to you again. The
stage beneath you, everyone around you, seems to

1502
02:19:02,753 --> 02:19:10,712
vanish in the light that's the attention of this
entity, this god, ancient beyond all thought and

1503
02:19:10,712 --> 02:19:14,877
reason that you would contemplate, awaiting your
answer.

1504
02:19:14,877 --> 02:19:25,736
LAURA: You know so much more than we do. If you
believe it is unsafe, then we trust your wisdom in

1505
02:19:25,736 --> 02:19:29,863
destroying it.

1506
02:19:29,863 --> 02:19:36,813
MATT: "The wisdom of the creators is to instill
their creations with the choice of their own

1507
02:19:36,813 --> 02:19:38,394
"destiny."

1508
02:19:38,394 --> 02:19:43,657
LAURA: Then I say destroy it.

1509
02:19:43,657 --> 02:19:45,594
MARISHA: What if we can--

1510
02:19:45,594 --> 02:19:52,806
MATT: "The choice is made." And with that point
you watch as, without leaving attention from you,

1511
02:19:52,806 --> 02:20:01,172
the eye begins to lift up out of the box once
more. The hand that was under the chin unfurls

1512
02:20:01,172 --> 02:20:08,262
into a clasping set of fingers, and as they clench
together, you hear the metal clink and grind, and

1513
02:20:08,262 --> 02:20:14,884
you watch as this light begins to flare around the
eye. And if you could hear a squeaking scream from

1514
02:20:14,884 --> 02:20:23,081
a powerful artifact, you watch as it just burns in
a flash. And (shattering noise) the shattering

1515
02:20:23,081 --> 02:20:28,092
sound echoes throughout the room. You see a burst
of greenish dark energy, and for a moment, the

1516
02:20:28,092 --> 02:20:32,678
light in the room seems to dim, like a very faint,
almost brown-out.

1517
02:20:32,678 --> 02:20:35,810
TRAVIS: (quietly) Shit.

1518
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:37,935
LIAM: Good.

1519
02:20:37,935 --> 02:20:39,605
LAURA: I think that's a good thing.

1520
02:20:39,605 --> 02:20:40,624
ASHLEY: I do, too.

1521
02:20:40,624 --> 02:20:42,001
LIAM: It is a good thing.

1522
02:20:42,001 --> 02:20:43,892
LAURA: Yes.

1523
02:20:43,892 --> 02:20:50,430
LIAM: Vecna's a puppeteer. He used that to move
Delilah. It's gone.

1524
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:53,912
MATT: "Now, if you have no further business..."

1525
02:20:53,912 --> 02:21:04,596
LAURA: We seek out the goddess Ioun, the goddess
of knowledge. The ritual of seeding was lost to

1526
02:21:04,596 --> 02:21:12,223
time, and we know that the goddess Ioun is one of
the only keepers of that knowledge.

1527
02:21:12,223 --> 02:21:36,554
MATT: There's a moment of contemplation on his
end. "She is safe. She recovers, hidden away. I

1528
02:21:36,554 --> 02:21:48,523
"know elements of where she resides, but this
information only belongs to those trusted."

1529
02:21:48,523 --> 02:22:06,723
MARISHA: We know you and her helped seal away the
chaos of these secrets before. We may need your

1530
02:22:06,723 --> 02:22:12,080
help doing it again.

1531
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:17,281
MATT: He leans forward towards you, and you feel
the beacon of attention shift towards you this

1532
02:22:17,281 --> 02:22:25,445
time. And you, Keyleth, who have spent most of
your life trying to dodge and dive from the

1533
02:22:25,445 --> 02:22:34,922
attention of the masses, trying to buck the
destiny that has been thrust upon you since

1534
02:22:34,922 --> 02:22:41,175
childhood, here in this moment, you have the
attention of one of the prime creator gods of

1535
02:22:41,175 --> 02:22:53,209
Exandria, and you feel yourself weaken and
strengthen at the same time. You're not sure

1536
02:22:53,209 --> 02:23:02,777
whether to run or stand, and the voice comes out
once more. "I have champions across all of

1537
02:23:02,777 --> 02:23:13,432
"Exandria who have lived longer and proven
themselves worthy, capable. My consecrations are

1538
02:23:13,432 --> 02:23:18,175
"taxing, and I will not have it wasted on those set
to fail."

1539
02:23:18,175 --> 02:23:25,899
LAURA: How can we prove ourselves to you?

1540
02:23:25,899 --> 02:23:37,473
MATT: "You have not one faithful among you, yet
you beseech my blessing."

1541
02:23:37,473 --> 02:23:51,023
MARISHA: I could be your champion. You could teach
me to believe. I, arguably, am faithless. I know

1542
02:23:51,023 --> 02:24:04,143
you all know that. I believe, and I have respect,
and I am awe-inspired by all of this. But faith, I

1543
02:24:04,143 --> 02:24:12,350
still don't know if I have, but I... I believe you
could teach me.

1544
02:24:12,350 --> 02:24:17,395
MATT: "Is there anyone else who would challenge
this proclamation?"

1545
02:24:17,395 --> 02:24:29,909
LAURA: I don't want to challenge you, Keyleth.

1546
02:24:29,909 --> 02:24:38,555
MARISHA: What? We already have one champion of the
Raven Queen. Why not?

1547
02:24:38,555 --> 02:24:45,215
TALIESIN: Once, you blessed Whitestone.

1548
02:24:45,215 --> 02:24:53,558
MATT: "Whitestone is under my watch and keep. It
was created through the battlefield in which I

1549
02:24:53,558 --> 02:25:01,134
"sealed Tharizdun himself. It was the grounds in
which Ioun was wounded in the Calamity. There was

1550
02:25:01,134 --> 02:25:06,791
"much sorrow in those lands. Yes, it is under my
watch."

1551
02:25:06,791 --> 02:25:16,472
MARISHA: I'm friends with the Sun Tree. We talk
occasionally.

1552
02:25:16,472 --> 02:25:30,255
MATT: "A faithless stands to try and accept the
champion's mantle. I ask once more, is there any

1553
02:25:30,255 --> 02:25:33,783
"to challenge this claim?"

1554
02:25:33,783 --> 02:25:45,928
LAURA: Keyleth... let me? I've never felt this
before.

1555
02:25:45,928 --> 02:25:57,516
MARISHA: You are the lady of Whitestone. It suits
you.

1556
02:25:57,516 --> 02:26:18,977
MATT: "Very well. You step forth with the growing
bud of faith. That befits the growth of a

1557
02:26:18,977 --> 02:26:32,502
"champion. I will see you show me your quality.
You, as the vessel, kneel before me."

1558
02:26:32,502 --> 02:26:37,709
LAURA: I kneel.

1559
02:26:37,709 --> 02:26:43,345
MATT: He leans forward at the edge of the throne,
you hear the metal clinking as the plates shift

1560
02:26:43,345 --> 02:26:50,913
and move. And you can hear now, at the proximity
as he leans down towards you, the faint flicker of

1561
02:26:50,913 --> 02:26:58,629
the surface of the sun-like head that is the
beacon of the Dawnfather's face. "You would accept

1562
02:26:58,629 --> 02:27:12,818
"my trial, brave soul? Then you and your allies
must ascend the Tower of the Zenith. The chosen

1563
02:27:12,818 --> 02:27:27,818
"among you, Lady Vex'ahlia, you must reach the top
of the tower before this time runs thin." As he

1564
02:27:27,818 --> 02:27:34,757
lifts his hand you watch, as apparating in the
air, a container of glass with sand across the

1565
02:27:34,757 --> 02:27:43,358
top. He lifts his other hand. Another one appears.
And these two hourglasses now held aloft, gliding

1566
02:27:43,358 --> 02:27:54,206
slowly above the space where you stand. "Ascend to
the zenith. Embrace your faith and throw yourself

1567
02:27:54,206 --> 02:28:04,258
"in the Fires of Dawn. Should you be strong of
heart and your faith be true, the flames will

1568
02:28:04,258 --> 02:28:06,357
"grant you my blessing."

1569
02:28:06,357 --> 02:28:12,417
LAURA: Just me, or the group of us?

1570
02:28:12,417 --> 02:28:24,487
MATT: "You must jump into the flames. They can
help you ascend. However, your trial begins now."

1571
02:28:24,487 --> 02:28:34,675
And you watch as one of the glasses suddenly
shifts, and three of the winged planars appear in

1572
02:28:34,675 --> 02:28:40,437
the room, armored around you, arms crossed, and
they look to be trying to block the passage into

1573
02:28:40,437 --> 02:28:47,087
the tower as they fly up. You look up to the
seemingly endless beacon above you, to the top of

1574
02:28:47,087 --> 02:28:52,905
the tower that you cannot see at this distance,
and you know immediately, somehow, quickly, you

1575
02:28:52,905 --> 02:28:57,597
have to get there. So. What are you doing?

1576
02:28:57,597 --> 02:28:58,830
TRAVIS: Oh god!

1577
02:28:58,830 --> 02:29:02,213
MARISHA: I. Hate. Timed. Challenges.

1578
02:29:02,213 --> 02:29:06,946
LAURA: Well, I've got the boots, but I-- okay, I'm
going, I take off.

1579
02:29:06,946 --> 02:29:08,541
SAM: Wait!

1580
02:29:08,541 --> 02:29:09,895
LIAM: Click your Boots of Haste.

1581
02:29:09,895 --> 02:29:12,629
SAM: I'm going to to turn her into a red dragon.

1582
02:29:12,629 --> 02:29:15,007
TRAVIS: Do you want that?

1583
02:29:15,007 --> 02:29:18,797
LAURA: Sure. I click my Boots of Haste before he
does it.

1584
02:29:18,797 --> 02:29:23,089
MATT: Okay, so you click your Boots of Haste. They
come into you, you feel the surge of energy, the

1585
02:29:23,089 --> 02:29:27,330
rush, the burst of adrenaline through your body,
as you begin casting?

1586
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:29,856
SAM: True Polymorph.

1587
02:29:29,856 --> 02:29:33,376
LAURA: Oh my god. Does that ever end? Do you have
to cancel it?

1588
02:29:33,376 --> 02:29:34,558
SAM: Yes.

1589
02:29:34,558 --> 02:29:39,646
MATT: All right, so as you begin to ascend, you
watch as the three planar begin to rush towards

1590
02:29:39,646 --> 02:29:42,129
you, their arms out to grasp. Anyone else going to
do anything?

1591
02:29:42,129 --> 02:29:45,152
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to smash my gauntlets
together and cast Enlarge.

1592
02:29:45,152 --> 02:29:47,536
MATT: All right, so you go into your larger form
now.

1593
02:29:47,536 --> 02:29:49,868
TRAVIS: And rage. I'll charge one of them.

1594
02:29:49,868 --> 02:29:51,984
MATT: They're up in the air. She's flying up.

1595
02:29:51,984 --> 02:29:53,373
TALIESIN: You've got the carpet.

1596
02:29:53,373 --> 02:29:55,542
TRAVIS: And I pull the carpet out.

1597
02:29:55,542 --> 02:29:58,114
MATT: Okay.

1598
02:29:58,114 --> 02:30:02,918
TALIESIN: I click my Boots of Spider Climbing and
spend an action surge to draw and start taking

1599
02:30:02,918 --> 02:30:05,998
shots at the wings. I want to drop them out of the
air.

1600
02:30:05,998 --> 02:30:12,300
MATT: Okay, go for it, make three shots. Very
quickly. As you're ascending on the broom as

1601
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:16,053
quickly as possible, and they begin to converge on
you, you feel this tickle of energy in the back of

1602
02:30:16,053 --> 02:30:22,216
your mind and you watch as your hands begin to
suddenly grow claws and scales, a red color.

1603
02:30:22,216 --> 02:30:27,678
TRAVIS: Vax! Do something!

1604
02:30:27,678 --> 02:30:30,586
LIAM: I cast Shield of Faith on my own ass.

1605
02:30:30,586 --> 02:30:33,130
MATT: Okay. Shield of Faith cast on Vax.

1606
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:34,906
LAURA: Can everybody fly?

1607
02:30:34,906 --> 02:30:36,739
TALIESIN: I'm running up the wall.

1608
02:30:36,739 --> 02:30:39,641
LAURA: Before I Polymorph, I toss you my broom.

1609
02:30:39,641 --> 02:30:41,639
SAM: Are you going to allow that?

1610
02:30:41,639 --> 02:30:47,019
MATT: Sure. So you throw the broom off the side,
and you begin to plummet immediately through the

1611
02:30:47,345 --> 02:30:51,814
air. As you're concentrating on the spell to cast
it, you finish it off, and you plummet back about

1612
02:30:52,123 --> 02:30:56,082
half the distance, and then (whoosh) these giant
leathery red dragon wings whip out of your form,

1613
02:30:56,082 --> 02:31:01,929
and you catch yourself. The broom clatters to the
ground, and Scanlan marches over and grabs it,

1614
02:31:01,929 --> 02:31:03,801
manages to get it under his grasp.

1615
02:31:03,801 --> 02:31:06,681
LAURA: You know that word!

1616
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:10,225
MATT: All righty. So you begin to ascend upward,
right as they begin to descend on your dragon

1617
02:31:10,225 --> 02:31:11,473
form.

1618
02:31:11,473 --> 02:31:13,398
TALIESIN: 20, 24, and 36.

1619
02:31:13,398 --> 02:31:15,912
MATT: 20, 24, and 36, they all hit!

1620
02:31:15,912 --> 02:31:21,722
TALIESIN: That's a strength saving throw, or they
fall a little bit.

1621
02:31:21,722 --> 02:31:23,896
MATT: Strength saving throw, all right, that is an
18?

1622
02:31:23,896 --> 02:31:26,056
TALIESIN: Nope. They fall.

1623
02:31:26,056 --> 02:31:27,226
MATT: 21?

1624
02:31:27,226 --> 02:31:28,393
TALIESIN: That's okay.

1625
02:31:28,393 --> 02:31:32,731
MATT: And a 12. So two of them. You shoot two of
the wings out of the way and they plummet down,

1626
02:31:32,731 --> 02:31:38,180
and you manage to coast past two of them in your
dragon form. One of them does manage to grab onto

1627
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:43,024
you and get its hands, big strong hands on the
back of your head and try and steer you to the

1628
02:31:43,024 --> 02:31:44,101
side.

1629
02:31:44,101 --> 02:31:46,090
LAURA: Can I cast Frightful Presence?

1630
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:53,560
MATT: We'll get to that in just a moment. It's
going to attempt to-- no. It tries to pull against

1631
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:59,684
you, but even with its extremely strong planar
strength it cannot guide you away from the path,

1632
02:31:59,684 --> 02:32:03,796
and you push past. You are now outside of the
chamber in the base of the tower, just flying

1633
02:32:03,796 --> 02:32:07,937
upward. You can go ahead and use your Frightful
Presence. All right, so that's your action.

1634
02:32:07,937 --> 02:32:12,907
LAURA: All of the creatures-- no, of my choosing,
so all the bad-- not bad guys, but you know,

1635
02:32:12,907 --> 02:32:14,488
people we're fighting.

1636
02:32:14,488 --> 02:32:20,483
MATT: As you roar loudly and it echoes, filling
the entirety of the chamber, the music of the

1637
02:32:20,483 --> 02:32:26,149
surroundings now merging and shifting with this
horrible dragon roar. None of these angelic

1638
02:32:26,149 --> 02:32:28,308
entities seem even remotely affected by it.

1639
02:32:28,308 --> 02:32:30,780
LAURA: Oh, really? They don't even have to make a
wisdom saving throw?

1640
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:33,611
MATT: They are immune to fear. Or being
frightened, sorry.

1641
02:32:33,611 --> 02:32:34,920
LAURA: That makes sense.

1642
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:40,085
MATT: But do you continue flying upward? Okay! So
you finish your spell, you take your shots,

1643
02:32:40,085 --> 02:32:42,565
Keyleth, Pike, anything?

1644
02:32:42,565 --> 02:32:47,594
ASHLEY: Am I close enough to Grog to hop onto the
carpet, as well?

1645
02:32:47,594 --> 02:32:50,843
MATT: Okay, so Pike and Grog get onto the carpet.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

1646
02:32:50,843 --> 02:32:54,444
MARISHA: Are people clustered up together by now?

1647
02:32:54,444 --> 02:32:58,656
LAURA: Do I take the alignment of the animal that
I'm polymorphed into?

1648
02:32:58,656 --> 02:33:00,838
MATT: Not the alignment, just your mental scores.

1649
02:33:00,838 --> 02:33:06,238
MARISHA: Are people super clustered, or is she now
clustered with them?

1650
02:33:06,238 --> 02:33:10,022
MATT: No, she's above everybody. She's way past
all you guys; she shot straight up.

1651
02:33:10,022 --> 02:33:12,848
MARISHA: So the angel dudes are all clustered
together?

1652
02:33:12,848 --> 02:33:19,919
MATT: Two of them fell a little bit, one of them's
on her back. She's making her way up, guys. The

1653
02:33:19,919 --> 02:33:22,267
first stained glass is starting to run out.

1654
02:33:22,267 --> 02:33:27,682
MARISHA: Throw up a big level five Flaming Sphere.
Ah, wait can I do a, with my spear can I do a

1655
02:33:27,682 --> 02:33:35,092
higher-level Fireball? And just do more charges
out of it? Or no?

1656
02:33:35,092 --> 02:33:38,565
MATT: I'll say no because you can't spend more
charges to increase the level of the spell.

1657
02:33:38,565 --> 02:33:43,068
MARISHA: Then I will do a 5th-level Flaming
Sphere.

1658
02:33:43,068 --> 02:33:53,025
MATT: Okay, so the Flaming Sphere slams upward
against the side there. Saving throw. Rolls a one

1659
02:33:53,025 --> 02:33:55,765
on saving throw. So it takes damage. Flaming spear
hits it, however--

1660
02:33:55,765 --> 02:33:57,178
MARISHA: It doesn't hit both of them?

1661
02:33:57,178 --> 02:34:02,769
MATT: No, you can slam it into one creature per
turn. The one that's on her back, you mean? What's

1662
02:34:02,769 --> 02:34:05,405
the range on the flaming sphere?

1663
02:34:05,405 --> 02:34:07,593
LAURA: Come on, the time is running out!

1664
02:34:07,593 --> 02:34:10,484
MATT: No time for a book. Never mind; it doesn't
matter. The flaming sphere slams into one of the

1665
02:34:10,484 --> 02:34:14,256
ones that's not on her back. It's too far out of
your range.  All right, so. Who's doing what

1666
02:34:14,256 --> 02:34:15,427
next?

1667
02:34:15,427 --> 02:34:17,126
TRAVIS: We're rocketing up on the rug.

1668
02:34:17,126 --> 02:34:20,414
MATT: Okay, the rug, not very fast, and her speed
is much faster as a dragon, so you guys are coming

1669
02:34:20,414 --> 02:34:22,671
up behind and you're just watching the dragon
(flapping).

1670
02:34:22,671 --> 02:34:24,965
TRAVIS: Are we close to any of the other two that
are at the bottom?

1671
02:34:24,965 --> 02:34:30,905
MATT: No, but as soon as that timer went out, the
chamber's roof above you slams shut. You're all

1672
02:34:30,905 --> 02:34:32,635
cut off from Vex.

1673
02:34:32,635 --> 02:34:35,124
TALIESIN: I was running up the wall. I didn't make
it in time?

1674
02:34:35,124 --> 02:34:37,024
MATT: Not at your speed, no. It's a big chamber.

1675
02:34:37,024 --> 02:34:44,625
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to haste, as fast as I can.
When I clicked my boots, do I still get a hasted

1676
02:34:44,625 --> 02:34:45,535
action?

1677
02:34:45,535 --> 02:34:46,506
MATT: Yes, you do.

1678
02:34:46,506 --> 02:34:48,537
LAURA: Okay, cool, then I can go 160 feet.

1679
02:34:48,537 --> 02:34:52,340
MATT: Yes, you can. The planar is still holding on
to the back of your head, it's going to make

1680
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:54,344
another strength check.

1681
02:34:54,344 --> 02:34:57,018
LAURA: I'm going to try to tail whip him. Is that
a thing I can do?

1682
02:34:57,018 --> 02:34:58,619
MATT: Make an athletics check.

1683
02:34:58,619 --> 02:35:04,014
LAURA: Okay. Oh, I have a red dice, it's so
perfect and I never choose this one.

1684
02:35:04,014 --> 02:35:05,617
MATT: What did you roll?

1685
02:35:05,617 --> 02:35:09,053
LAURA: Oh, okay, well. What am I adding to it?

1686
02:35:09,053 --> 02:35:12,317
MATT: Add your strength modifier. If there isn't
an athletics score, then whatever your strength

1687
02:35:12,317 --> 02:35:13,889
modifier is.

1688
02:35:13,889 --> 02:35:15,889
LAURA: That would be plus five?

1689
02:35:15,889 --> 02:35:18,028
SAM: Are you talking about hers or the dragon's?

1690
02:35:18,028 --> 02:35:19,947
LAURA: Oh, a plus seven. So 13.

1691
02:35:19,947 --> 02:35:24,508
MATT: 13. The planar grabs one side of your horn
and causes you to slam into the side of the tower,

1692
02:35:24,508 --> 02:35:30,677
and you skid across and smash into one of the
stained glass windows which (smash) fires out the

1693
02:35:30,677 --> 02:35:35,208
side and you end up slowing down a bit and it
actually takes you a moment, it halves your speed

1694
02:35:35,208 --> 02:35:39,379
for this round. You try and get your wings back
up. Are you going to do anything about the guy on

1695
02:35:39,379 --> 02:35:41,559
your back or are you going to keep plugging as
fast as you can upwards?

1696
02:35:41,559 --> 02:35:44,357
LAURA: He's on my back, or he's like hanging onto
me?

1697
02:35:44,357 --> 02:35:47,931
MATT: He's on your neck and head. He's holding on
and trying to steer you off to the side by

1698
02:35:47,931 --> 02:35:49,348
controlling your movement.

1699
02:35:49,348 --> 02:35:53,890
LAURA: I'm going to spin and try to slam into the
wall and knock him into the stone.

1700
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:56,711
SAM: Can she do like a wing thing?

1701
02:35:56,711 --> 02:36:00,620
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to use my wings to thrust
me faster into the wall.

1702
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:03,890
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check.

1703
02:36:03,890 --> 02:36:09,869
LAURA: No, no. Okay. Athletics check, was a plus
seven, so 19.

1704
02:36:09,869 --> 02:36:15,638
MATT: 19? 17. so you slam into the wall and you
hear (groans) behind you. The stained glass that

1705
02:36:15,638 --> 02:36:20,833
shattered, reforms right where you left it, and
you continue to ascend upwards. Still holding onto

1706
02:36:20,833 --> 02:36:25,329
you, but it's now disadvantaged on its next roll
because you slammed it into the wall. So

1707
02:36:25,329 --> 02:36:29,873
(flapping) making your ascent upward as fast as
you can, you watch as the tower slowly pincers

1708
02:36:29,873 --> 02:36:35,989
closer and closer. You watch as another layer
begins to close above. All right. He's going to

1709
02:36:35,989 --> 02:36:40,039
attempt to try and slam you into the wall again.
Go ahead and make another athletics check. Roll a

1710
02:36:40,039 --> 02:36:42,502
d20 and add your strength modifier. Go for it.

1711
02:36:42,502 --> 02:36:43,953
LAURA: Okay. That one didn't count.

1712
02:36:43,953 --> 02:36:45,578
MATT: You didn't intend to roll it.

1713
02:36:45,578 --> 02:36:47,379
LAURA: Okay. Ooh, okay, 21.

1714
02:36:47,379 --> 02:36:51,386
MATT: Yeah, you beat him. He tries to pull you off
to the side and you begin to skid into it. Your

1715
02:36:51,386 --> 02:36:54,568
wing hits the side of the tower (scraping noise),
but you keep pushing forward. The pain hits you,

1716
02:36:54,568 --> 02:36:58,689
you end up taking about 25 points of damage, just
grinding into this divine golden side but you keep

1717
02:36:58,689 --> 02:37:04,244
flying up (flapping) the tower gets tighter and
tighter and tighter. You now can see as the planar

1718
02:37:04,244 --> 02:37:08,123
is going to attempt to--

1719
02:37:08,123 --> 02:37:09,478
LAURA: Wait, can I--

1720
02:37:09,478 --> 02:37:11,410
MATT: What are you going to do?

1721
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:16,289
LAURA: Is he hanging onto me with one arm now?
What is he doing, because I knocked him into the

1722
02:37:16,289 --> 02:37:17,379
wall, right?

1723
02:37:17,379 --> 02:37:19,682
MATT: Yeah. What are you doing?

1724
02:37:19,682 --> 02:37:23,656
LAURA: I'm going to just dash. I'm going to fuck
him and just dash.

1725
02:37:23,656 --> 02:37:25,591
MATT: You're going to go double speed, all right.

1726
02:37:25,591 --> 02:37:26,964
LAURA: Double speed!

1727
02:37:26,964 --> 02:37:32,921
MATT: You shoot up. That gives him a full round to
go ahead and try and scare you off. Roll again with

1728
02:37:32,921 --> 02:37:36,829
your strength.

1729
02:37:36,829 --> 02:37:39,259
LAURA: 15.

1730
02:37:39,259 --> 02:37:43,351
MATT: (crash) Slams you into the wall. You skid
and slow down a little bit. You can see it's

1731
02:37:43,351 --> 02:37:47,000
closing. But you are dashing so you get a second
speed run, which does get you up towards where the

1732
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,173
wall's closing now. You can see now the bright
light is getting brighter and brighter. Your eyes

1733
02:37:50,173 --> 02:37:53,582
are hurting in its presence, you can see a
large brazier at the top of the tower that is now

1734
02:37:53,582 --> 02:37:58,441
in flames, before you. You're not quite there; you
have one more round. He's going to go ahead and

1735
02:37:58,441 --> 02:38:01,879
now turn around, and now the angel turns around on
your face. He is going to attempt to punch in your

1736
02:38:01,879 --> 02:38:02,999
eyes.

1737
02:38:02,999 --> 02:38:04,989
SAM: Do you have legendary--

1738
02:38:04,989 --> 02:38:07,369
LAURA: I'm going to use my legendary resistance.

1739
02:38:07,369 --> 02:38:11,466
MATT: Well, it's a physical attack on you. What's
your AC?

1740
02:38:11,466 --> 02:38:15,010
LAURA: 19. Natural.

1741
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:17,537
MATT: Yeah, it hits you, you take disadvantage on
your next strike. Go ahead and roll an athletics

1742
02:38:17,537 --> 02:38:20,958
check to try and buck him off. One last time, this
is the only one you have time for. Disadvantage

1743
02:38:20,958 --> 02:38:22,907
because he punched you in the face.

1744
02:38:22,949 --> 02:38:25,626
LAURA: Okay, 14.

1745
02:38:25,626 --> 02:38:28,531
MATT: 14, all right, you're slowing down, you're
slowing down, you're not quite getting there, he's

1746
02:38:28,531 --> 02:38:29,930
bashing you in the face--

1747
02:38:29,930 --> 02:38:31,710
LAURA: I'm going to take my claws up and rake
him!

1748
02:38:31,710 --> 02:38:35,381
MATT: Okay, make another strength check.

1749
02:38:35,381 --> 02:38:36,858
LAURA: What is it, 18!

1750
02:38:36,858 --> 02:38:41,726
MATT: 11! You thrust him off your face! As he
falls off down below, (flapping) you make it up to

1751
02:38:41,726 --> 02:38:46,479
the top, and you now see the brazier is about the
size of your dragon form. It's physically your

1752
02:38:46,479 --> 02:38:50,010
size and you can see now the tower's beginning to
close around you, what are you going to do?

1753
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:52,512
LAURA: I'm going to reach the tower thing and push
myself up through.

1754
02:38:52,512 --> 02:38:55,822
MATT: Okay, you pull your way up to the top, and
now you're right above the brazier and the flames.

1755
02:38:55,822 --> 02:38:58,650
You look down into the brazier, the fire there
burning is ever-present light--

1756
02:38:58,650 --> 02:39:00,200
LAURA: I rush into the fire!

1757
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:04,487
MATT: You dive into the fire. Your dragon form.
which resists it at that point, it immerses your

1758
02:39:04,487 --> 02:39:09,875
entire form, at which point you hear the tower,
guys, above you crack and you hear this echoing

1759
02:39:09,875 --> 02:39:17,131
(smash) sound, of what sounds like shattering of a
thousand windows at once. You, as you dive into

1760
02:39:17,131 --> 02:39:26,274
the flames, feel this moment of searing bright
pain in your eyes, in your mind. Your dragon form

1761
02:39:26,274 --> 02:39:35,561
is immune to flames, but your form suddenly
shrinks, the spell dispelled, the dragonoid form

1762
02:39:35,561 --> 02:39:50,491
cast away. You sense this kind of lost nothing; your whole
body is numb at this point, and you are just

1763
02:39:50,491 --> 02:39:56,669
surrounded by a white light. Much like where Vax,
in the plane in his communion with the Raven

1764
02:39:56,669 --> 02:40:05,282
Queen is shrouded in darkness, this is endless,
every color. You have no sense of personal form.

1765
02:40:05,333 --> 02:40:13,003
You have no sense of time, place, and for the
first time in a long time, you don't remember your

1766
02:40:13,003 --> 02:40:22,490
name. For a brief instant, you think, what bit of
conscious thought you can make, is this is what

1767
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:33,547
oblivion feels like? Did you make the right
choice? Were you led astray? Were you strong of

1768
02:40:33,547 --> 02:40:48,953
heart enough? The flames were intended to cleanse
away sin, darkness, possibly those who are

1769
02:40:48,953 --> 02:41:05,701
unworthy. Is this it now? Did you fail?

1770
02:41:05,701 --> 02:41:14,241
You guys down below watch as the chamber doors
that closed off above you (scraping noise) open up

1771
02:41:14,241 --> 02:41:22,578
again to reveal the tower. And you can see there,
suspended in the middle of the air, thousands of

1772
02:41:22,578 --> 02:41:32,042
shards of stained glass that had shattered inwards
from the impact but frozen, held in place. As they

1773
02:41:32,042 --> 02:41:39,683
all slowly retract back, reforming the windows
that were once there. Whatever impact or shock

1774
02:41:39,683 --> 02:41:48,933
wave had scattered them below reversed and
repaired. And you watch as they do so, ascending,

1775
02:41:48,933 --> 02:42:01,182
until the tower's back untouched as it was. The
one planar that had ridden the dragon form of Vex

1776
02:42:01,182 --> 02:42:09,840
towards the top of the tower slowly descends
(flapping) and lands next to the three others. And

1777
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:16,821
they all give a nod towards the Dawnfather, who's
still there, not looking upward, just looking at the

1778
02:42:16,821 --> 02:42:22,902
rest of the remaining members of Vox Machina, his
beacon of attention just shifting from one to the

1779
02:42:22,902 --> 02:42:44,713
other. The three planars leave the still-open
doors. "What does she mean to you?"

1780
02:42:44,713 --> 02:42:47,611
SAM: To us? Oh god.

1781
02:42:47,611 --> 02:42:55,447
MATT: "To you, all of you."

1782
02:42:55,447 --> 02:43:11,193
MARISHA: I told you that I was faithless, which
might be true when it comes to the gods, but not

1783
02:43:11,193 --> 02:43:33,011
with Vex'ahlia, not with Vox Machina. She gives me
my power.

1784
02:43:33,011 --> 02:43:59,252
SAM: Her name is Vex, and she is greedy and mean
sometimes, and she can steal a lot. She's a little

1785
02:43:59,252 --> 02:44:12,352
bit not the greatest person, but her flaws
highlight everything that is right about her,

1786
02:44:12,352 --> 02:44:21,502
which is she does all these things to protect her
friends and her family. She would give her life

1787
02:44:21,502 --> 02:44:36,982
for any of us and for anyone who was truly in
need. And she's not perfect, but she's the most

1788
02:44:36,982 --> 02:44:42,268
perfect of all of us.

1789
02:44:42,268 --> 02:44:50,909
TRAVIS: She believes in me. She tries to teach me
to use my brain, which I don't do very often. She

1790
02:44:50,909 --> 02:44:57,230
tries to teach me to learn from the world. And she
always cheers me on, which not a lot of people do.

1791
02:44:57,230 --> 02:45:02,033
I believe in her.

1792
02:45:02,033 --> 02:45:08,272
MATT: The beacon shifts to you, Pike.

1793
02:45:08,272 --> 02:45:24,045
PIKE: I don't have a real sister, but I consider
her more of my sister than I've ever had. She's

1794
02:45:24,045 --> 02:45:39,811
family, and if you take her from me, there will be
hell to pay.

1795
02:45:39,811 --> 02:45:45,232
MATT: The beacon shifts to Percival.

1796
02:45:45,232 --> 02:45:57,799
PERCY: She is Mistress of the Grey Hunt of
Whitestone, Baroness of the First House of

1797
02:45:57,799 --> 02:46:11,111
Whitestone. She is my heart and my judgment and
the future that I have chosen, and she is the one

1798
02:46:11,111 --> 02:46:16,796
that I have betrothed to.

1799
02:46:16,796 --> 02:46:24,255
SAM: What? Betrothed?

1800
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:34,463
MATT: The beacon shifts back to Vax.

1801
02:46:34,463 --> 02:46:47,454
LIAM: She is every hope I have. When I am gone,
she will make the world right. She has the

1802
02:46:47,454 --> 02:46:57,124
intelligence and the savviness and the heart to
make real-world decisions. She is me, but better.

1803
02:46:57,124 --> 02:47:12,764
She is your champion.

1804
02:47:12,764 --> 02:47:19,360
MATT: "Then there is hope." And you watch as in the
center of the chamber, a second star seems to be

1805
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:27,003
birthed before you, this bright point of light that begins to
swell in equal intensity as the head of the

1806
02:47:27,003 --> 02:47:32,037
Dawnfather himself, as a flash consumes the
chamber, and there before you, you see, now

1807
02:47:32,037 --> 02:47:43,257
reborn, hair scattered back, intact, slowly
descending, eyes closed, consciousness not yet

1808
02:47:43,257 --> 02:47:53,350
drawn from within: Vex'ahlia. As her feet touch
the ground and she falls to her knees, she

1809
02:47:53,350 --> 02:47:57,867
breathes in.

1810
02:47:57,867 --> 02:48:11,616
Your eyes open. You look around and see the faces
of your friends, your family. And you're

1811
02:48:11,616 --> 02:48:18,049
immediately aware of the presence of the entity
behind you. As you spin and look, whereas there once

1812
02:48:18,049 --> 02:48:28,606
was a burning star-- and to the rest of you, you
see the painful, endless light that averts your

1813
02:48:28,606 --> 02:48:39,198
gaze-- it doesn't hurt your eyes as much, and you
can see the faint features, the soft cheeks, the

1814
02:48:39,198 --> 02:48:50,146
hairless head, and the bright warm eyes of he who
brings the dawn. And you can see the smile there,

1815
02:48:50,146 --> 02:49:04,661
behind the light. "There is hope."

1816
02:49:04,661 --> 02:49:07,180
Get your blessing of the Dawnfather.

1817
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:09,911
(gasping and cheering)

1818
02:49:09,911 --> 02:49:12,109
TRAVIS: Holy shit, Super Saiyan.

1819
02:49:12,109 --> 02:49:15,348
LAURA: What did I get? What is it?

1820
02:49:15,348 --> 02:49:18,078
MATT: You naturally have resistance to necrotic
damage.

1821
02:49:18,078 --> 02:49:22,348
LAURA: That's good for me. That fucking Finger of
Death.

1822
02:49:22,348 --> 02:49:24,938
MATT: And if you want to read the rest of that,
you can.

1823
02:49:24,938 --> 02:49:32,030
LAURA: As a bonus action, you channel the light of
day into your being. For one hour you admit,

1824
02:49:32,030 --> 02:49:38,197
emit-- fuck me running, you emit bright light in a
120-foot radius, and any evil creature within that

1825
02:49:38,197 --> 02:49:45,247
120-foot radius that hits you with an attack or
spell immediately suffers 4d6 radiant damage and

1826
02:49:45,247 --> 02:49:46,838
is knocked prone.

1827
02:49:46,838 --> 02:49:50,229
MARISHA: Wow! You're a walking nuke!

1828
02:49:50,229 --> 02:49:52,411
LIAM: Shine bright like a diamond.

1829
02:49:52,411 --> 02:49:56,504
LAURA: (laughs) Once this blessing ability is
used, it can't be used again for seven days.

1830
02:49:56,504 --> 02:49:58,230
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1831
02:49:58,230 --> 02:49:59,866
LAURA: Holy moly.

1832
02:49:59,866 --> 02:50:03,109
ASHLEY: Blessings of the gods!

1833
02:50:03,109 --> 02:50:07,711
TALIESIN: We'll have to add a sixth star to the de
Rolo crest. Fucking excited.

1834
02:50:07,711 --> 02:50:20,673
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to
represent you.

1835
02:50:20,673 --> 02:50:34,567
MATT: "If what you say is true, then we are too
late to prevent his ascension. Know that killing a

1836
02:50:34,567 --> 02:50:44,673
"god is beyond even most deities. To destroy is to
diminish one low enough to seal them away for

1837
02:50:44,673 --> 02:50:53,701
"eternity, as I have done once before. Such a
technique I used to banish the Chained Oblivion

1838
02:50:53,701 --> 02:51:06,007
"once, after it nearly slew the Knowing Mistress.
Having brought it low in battle, Ioun had devised

1839
02:51:06,007 --> 02:51:10,250
"something she called the Prime Trammel."

1840
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:17,072
SAM: The Prime Trammel.

1841
02:51:17,072 --> 02:51:31,582
MATT: "Guided by a sizable sliver of a god's
power, one such device could be formed, and when

1842
02:51:31,582 --> 02:51:41,255
"enough are affixed to a wounded god, seal them
away in a plane beyond the Astral Sea. Such a

1843
02:51:41,255 --> 02:51:47,121
"method could perhaps force a new god back through
the Divine Gate and beyond the reach of your

1844
02:51:47,121 --> 02:52:01,523
"world. Ioun, however, the one who has the design
for such an artifact-- she has been in hiding

1845
02:52:01,523 --> 02:52:11,568
"since her wounding. She heals still, the wounded
god, and has feared for the past eight centuries

1846
02:52:11,568 --> 02:52:21,241
"that her enemies seek to finish the job. We
communicate on occasion through missives and

1847
02:52:21,241 --> 02:52:36,601
"emissaries. All that I know is the key to her
hidden realm is within someone. The last word from

1848
02:52:36,601 --> 02:52:44,219
"the mistress from nearly a century before granted
me this." The gauntleted hand extends and opens,

1849
02:52:44,219 --> 02:52:51,090
and there you see, apparating in the space above,
what appears to be a three-dimensional

1850
02:52:51,090 --> 02:52:59,565
topographical map of some kind. It slowly rotates,
made of pure sunlight and flame. It's a mountain

1851
02:52:59,565 --> 02:53:11,058
range with a glowing light within a small, hidden
house or hovel within a forest. Make an

1852
02:53:11,058 --> 02:53:21,736
investigation check. I would say Keyleth,
Vex'ahlia, Vax'ildan, and Scanlan.

1853
02:53:21,736 --> 02:53:23,892
SAM: Natural 20.

1854
02:53:23,892 --> 02:53:27,611
LAURA: Oh, good, thank god. Because mine sucked.

1855
02:53:27,611 --> 02:53:29,382
MARISHA: Also a natural 20.

1856
02:53:29,382 --> 02:53:32,961
SAM: It's a real good map.

1857
02:53:32,961 --> 02:53:36,749
MATT: Yeah. What did you get, Vax?

1858
02:53:36,749 --> 02:53:38,699
LIAM: Not a natural 20.

1859
02:53:38,699 --> 02:53:48,192
MATT: Okay. Glancing at it, both of you recognize,
as it pulls back and shifts inward, this is deep

1860
02:53:48,192 --> 02:53:54,767
within the Cliffkeep. This is far north of
Kraghammer. This is in a forested region outside

1861
02:53:54,767 --> 02:53:56,500
the Pools of Wittebak.

1862
02:53:56,500 --> 02:54:00,691
MARISHA: Pools of Wittebak?

1863
02:54:00,691 --> 02:54:13,432
MATT: Wittebak. Once a gnomish home, it befell to
a terrible natural occurrence sparked by unnatural

1864
02:54:13,432 --> 02:54:21,872
means, and since has become a series of acidic and
toxic natural liquids and waters that burble up

1865
02:54:21,872 --> 02:54:29,348
from beneath the earth, and many wandering giants
and larger ogrish folk use to their heart's

1866
02:54:29,348 --> 02:54:36,330
content. But it's not in the Pools of Wittebak,
just near it, this strange hovel. The voice of the

1867
02:54:36,330 --> 02:54:43,372
Dawnfather burns forth once more, the heavy
resonance shaking the room. "If you seek to devise

1868
02:54:43,372 --> 02:54:52,158
"these Prime Trammels, then take this stone, my
champion. It should be enough essence for one of

1869
02:54:52,158 --> 02:54:59,742
"them." You watch as he reaches up into the halo,
the corona of light around the head, and plucks

1870
02:54:59,742 --> 02:55:08,447
from behind an ear a small bead of extremely
bright light. As he pulls it from his head, you

1871
02:55:08,447 --> 02:55:17,083
watch the strength and intensity of his glow ever
so faintly diminish, and places it in your hand.

1872
02:55:17,083 --> 02:55:23,050
As soon as it releases from the gauntleted
fingers-- so massive, each finger is as thick as

1873
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:31,765
your torso, it plops into your palm, and the glow
fades, and there before you, you see what looks to

1874
02:55:31,765 --> 02:55:35,113
be some sort of an oval-like opal.

1875
02:55:35,113 --> 02:55:37,242
LAURA: I love opals.

1876
02:55:37,242 --> 02:55:52,165
MATT: "Now, I have invested what I can safely do
within you. Go. Be swift. Find this key. Strike

1877
02:55:52,165 --> 02:56:05,592
"soon. Destroy or seal this great evil and prove my
faith in you is not misplaced, Vex'ahlia."

1878
02:56:05,592 --> 02:56:09,862
LAURA: It won't be.

1879
02:56:09,862 --> 02:56:17,473
MATT: The doors behind you that are already
partially ajar (rumble) open up all the way.

1880
02:56:17,473 --> 02:56:26,715
LAURA: I guess I'll put this in a really safe
pocket, then. There's one that's got an extra

1881
02:56:26,715 --> 02:56:30,922
snap. Triple snap and then a zipper over it.

1882
02:56:30,922 --> 02:56:34,169
MARISHA: Just don't let it fall in the toilet when
you go over to flush.

1883
02:56:34,169 --> 02:56:37,603
TRAVIS: I take out the little pebble and I drop it
on the floor.

1884
02:56:37,603 --> 02:56:40,712
MATT: You reach for the pebble. It's not there.

1885
02:56:40,712 --> 02:56:46,307
TRAVIS: Shit. Is there a hole in it? No?

1886
02:56:46,307 --> 02:56:52,016
MATT: No hole. Sarenrae was not going to teleport
you across the realm, letting you take away one of

1887
02:56:52,016 --> 02:56:54,969
the prized souls of her people.

1888
02:56:54,969 --> 02:56:56,687
TRAVIS: Oh, those were the souls!

1889
02:56:56,687 --> 02:56:59,694
LIAM: That was the pope, Travis. That was the
pope.

1890
02:56:59,694 --> 02:57:02,157
TRAVIS: Should've swallowed the rock.

1891
02:57:02,157 --> 02:57:11,305
MATT: As you exit the chamber, you can see the
various souls and planar that wander the halls on

1892
02:57:11,305 --> 02:57:19,597
their own business have all now joined shoulder to
shoulder as a procession, showing you a respectful

1893
02:57:19,597 --> 02:57:26,798
exit from the compound. As you walk, they all seem
to give a nod of respect towards Vex'ahlia, the

1894
02:57:26,798 --> 02:57:35,434
now freshly chosen champion of Pelor for this
endeavor. As you step beyond the staircase that

1895
02:57:35,434 --> 02:57:43,427
leads you down beyond the Fortress of the Sun,
into the center of the clearing that is watched

1896
02:57:43,427 --> 02:57:48,935
and protected by the various trees of the
Dawnfather, looking out amongst the endless

1897
02:57:48,935 --> 02:57:58,447
progression of the orchards, you consider what
your next path is to discover who and what this

1898
02:57:58,447 --> 02:58:08,057
key is to Ioun, and hopefully there's enough
time., because time, right now, and the decisions you make,

1899
02:58:08,095 --> 02:58:12,707
will greatly affect what can and cannot be done.

1900
02:58:12,707 --> 02:58:15,295
And that's where we're going to end tonight's session.

1901
02:58:15,295 --> 02:58:20,087
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What the fuck!

1902
02:58:20,087 --> 02:58:22,233
MARISHA: Champions over here.

1903
02:58:22,233 --> 02:58:23,478
LAURA: Oh shit.

1904
02:58:23,478 --> 02:58:26,014
SAM: (singing) We are the champions.

1905
02:58:26,014 --> 02:58:30,281
MATT: This is so fun. I haven't been able to do
epic-level content! That's so fun!

1906
02:58:30,281 --> 02:58:37,542
MARISHA: Is every episode going to be this
emotional for the rest of the game? I can't keep

1907
02:58:37,542 --> 02:58:38,588
doing this.

1908
02:58:38,588 --> 02:58:40,436
TRAVIS: Liam, what did you say?

1909
02:58:40,436 --> 02:58:43,787
LIAM: I said the twins are officially salt and
pepper shakers.

1910
02:58:43,787 --> 02:58:45,706
MATT: You totally are.

1911
02:58:45,706 --> 02:58:47,159
LAURA: Oh my god, and I have the white--

1912
02:58:47,159 --> 02:58:49,207
MATT: You have the white dragon scale armor.

1913
02:58:49,207 --> 02:58:50,182
LIAM: That's right.

1914
02:58:50,182 --> 02:58:51,287
LAURA: Tight.

1915
02:58:51,287 --> 02:58:53,346
MATT: That's actually pretty great.

1916
02:58:53,346 --> 02:58:57,367
TALIESIN: I think this actually changes the crest
of Whitestone now, because now there's a sixth

1917
02:58:57,367 --> 02:59:03,647
champion of Pelor who's of Whitestone. Six stars,
not five now. Holy cow.

1918
02:59:03,647 --> 02:59:06,536
MATT: Oh man. You should really not change that
crest, because it's in the campaign guide that's

1919
02:59:06,536 --> 02:59:08,458
being published in two months.

1920
02:59:08,458 --> 02:59:09,848
TALIESIN: It would only be hers.

1921
02:59:09,848 --> 02:59:11,899
MATT: Okay, there we go. I feel better about that
now.

1922
02:59:11,899 --> 02:59:14,046
TALIESIN: It would only be her house crest.

1923
02:59:14,046 --> 02:59:19,420
MATT: You know, it's okay, because the book
technically takes place before all of this. There

1924
02:59:19,420 --> 02:59:20,527
you go.

1925
02:59:20,527 --> 02:59:27,430
LIAM: Matt, I also have to throw out. We on Skype
now get the full Twitch view, so I'm seeing you

1926
02:59:27,430 --> 02:59:34,337
guys with all your icons, with everything, and it
is the weirdest amalgamation of Baldur's Gate and

1927
02:59:34,337 --> 02:59:42,710
Sega's full-motion video game from 1995 Night Trap
starring Different Strokes.

1928
02:59:42,710 --> 02:59:51,121
MATT: That's all I've wanted. All I've ever wanted
as a creative was to develop, design, and produce

1929
02:59:51,121 --> 02:59:58,241
what I would consider to be today's Night Trap for
you all. If we could achieve that, I've done my

1930
02:59:58,241 --> 02:59:59,249
job.

1931
02:59:59,249 --> 03:00:01,625

really appreciate it, guys.

1934
03:00:05,641 --> 03:00:08,050
ASHLEY: I love you, guys.

1935
03:00:08,050 --> 03:00:10,613
MARISHA: We're god hunting without you guys. It's
weird.

1936

TALIESIN: We need our east coasters.

1937
03:00:12,337 --> 03:00:15,207
ASHLEY: Man, to think I almost didn't Skype in
tonight.

1938
03:00:15,207 --> 03:00:17,612
MATT: I know! I'm glad you could.

1939
03:00:17,612 --> 03:00:22,280
LIAM: I'll give all my cows a hug for you.

1940
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:31,182
MATT: All right, guys. Our tickets for the live
show at Gen Con go up tomorrow morning. Look for

1941
03:00:31,182 --> 03:00:33,706
that. Hopefully see you guys there.

1942
03:00:33,706 --> 03:00:38,702
TRAVIS: It's in an even bigger theater. We had an
amazing time last time, and this theater is even

1943
03:00:38,702 --> 03:00:42,858
larger, and will be mad, mad crazy.

1944
03:00:42,858 --> 03:00:46,389
SAM: Live, in person. Find out how tall Travis
really is.

1945
03:00:46,389 --> 03:00:47,710
LIAM: Four foot three.

1946
03:00:47,710 --> 03:00:51,038
LAURA: We're all teeny.

1947
03:00:51,038 --> 03:00:56,570
MATT: Well, thank you guys so much. Rest well,
especially you east coasters, and you east

1948
03:00:56,570 --> 03:01:00,985
coasters, and you other country-ers. Have a
wonderful night. Sleep well.

1949
03:01:00,985 --> 03:01:02,319

awesome sponsor!
