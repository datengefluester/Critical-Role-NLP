1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:03,363
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:08,265
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We have a bunch of

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:11,723
announcements; try and get through them as fast as
possible. First and foremost, Taliesin Jaffe is on

4
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:14,958
his way, he's playing the part of Sam Riegel and
being late today.

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,968
SAM: Yeah. Clever.

6
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:20,929
MATT: But he'll be here shortly. And we do not
have a Travis Willingham tonight, unfortunately,

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:27,116
he is out of town shooting something pretty
awesome, so yeah, boo indeed. Not watching

8
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,602
Avengers this time.

9
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:31,360
LAURA: That was the only time he's missed.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,353
MATT: That was the only time he's missed it, yeah.
And he was not happy. I know. He's like, why is

11
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:42,939
everyone else leveling and not me yet? Nah, sorry
dude. Anyway, so we'll miss you Travis, sorry

12
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:49,261
you're not here. Oh, it sounds like we have a
Taliesin. Get in there, Taliesin. We have two

13
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:50,527
sponsors--

14
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,889
SAM: Wait, what, Matt? Two sponsors?

15
00:00:52,889 --> 00:01:01,960
MATT: What? Two sponsors. We're splitting this up,
is what we're doing. First, the new tonight-only

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,826
sponsor we have is Puzzle Quest, Magic Puzzle
Quest, actually. If you've watched any other

17
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:13,166
programs this week, Me, Marisha, Liam and Taliesin
all did a show that was on Tuesday. Before Talks

18
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:18,172
Machina. Game the Game, with Rebecca and Ivan,
where we played it, as well as a number of other

19
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:22,545
ridiculous games. But it's great, I grew up
playing Magic, it's very much a mutually--

20
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:25,028
SAM: Oh, Taliesin has it on his iPad right there!

21
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:31,906
MATT: There you go, and it's facing sideways. But
it's a puzzle drop game, but mixed in with the

22
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:36,185
mechanics of Magic. It's free, you can check it
out, and they're being awesome, sponsoring us

23
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:44,111
tonight. If you're into fantasy and that type of
three-match games, totally up your alley, and if

24
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:50,190
you click on the link in chat, which is
bit.ly/criticalquest and try the game out. That's

25
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,563
where you can go ahead and find it. So--

26
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,584
LIAM: You should totally play that during the
Thordak fight.

27
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:57,145
TALIESIN: This is my plan, while you guys are
doing your stuff, I'm going to be playing Puzzle Quest.

28
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:00,727
MATT: Oh and Taliesin, also I have left a sheet
there for your updated Cabal's Ruin.

29
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:03,069
MARISHA: Yeah, we have updated stuff.

30
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,982
TALIESIN: Wow, you nerfed me. Okay. I'm just
kidding.

31
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:11,409
MATT: No, in working on the campaign guide, and
the section about the Vestiges, while also seeing

32
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:14,006
how things played out through the game as we've
gone through, there's been a slight balance tweak

33
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:18,659
to a couple of them, most in your favor. Enjoy.

34
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,955
TALIESIN: I think you were giving me a little bit
of this drunkenly during Westworld, if I recall.

35
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,464
MATT: I think so, actually, yeah.

36
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:28,638
MARISHA: The main thing that has changed on the
Spire of Conflux is that I now gain plus one bonus

37
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:32,816
to spell attack rolls and my spell save DC
increases by one.

38
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,976
MATT: It's a benefit to you.

39
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,115
MARISHA: Yes it is.

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,321
MATT: It's a benefit to anybody who uses it in
their own home campaign, it is not just specific.

41
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:43,322
LAURA: And Fenthras is a plus five to attack? And
plus ten to damage rolls?

42
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:46,124
LIAM: 12 hours of wings, Matt? Thank you!

43
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,973
MATT: All the Vestiges suddenly turn to dust. In
your bag. And your tears.

44
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,969
LIAM: You have chosen poorly.

45
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:59,525
MATT: Exactly. So yeah! So aside from Magic Puzzle
Quest, we also have our secondary sponsor, Loot Crate!

46
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:05,042
SAM: You know, guys, I always do a little fun Loot
Crate thing, but this week I'm not going to be

47
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:12,715
doing the Loot Crate announcement. This week, my
new character that I've been workshopping, Brody

48
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:19,306
Slater! Of Malibu, California is going to be doing
the Loot Crate ad. I've been workshopping this,

49
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:23,259
I've been doing some acting coach work with it.

50
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,611
TALIESIN: How you never did a rhyme on SNL is
beyond me, man, I don't know how--

51
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:30,217
SAM: It's a showcase for Loot Crate, but it's also
a showcase for my acting.

52
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,268
(laughter)

53
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:40,472
SAM: Let me get into character real quick. Yo surf
bros and bunnies! December can be a mondo bogus

54
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:45,069
bummer! You want to lock in on a maxed out
cruncher, ride an outside breaker, shoot the curl

55
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,091
on an epic set, but you can't! It's too cold! The
beaches are blown out, the swells are glassy, and

56
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:58,168
you feel like you're getting a sand facial, like
some gremlin poser, amirite? Well not for long!

57
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:03,568
Get amped again with December's radical Loot
Crate. The primo duds'll get your heart beating

58
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:08,467
like a gnarlatious double spinner, toes on the
nose! The geeky gear will make you feel like

59
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:13,923
you're droppin' in on the wedge, pruning out at
Pendleton, or taking a face goofy-foot at Sano,

60
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:26,426
outrageous! So don't wipe out, sign up! For Loot
Crate! At lootrate.com/criticalrole, promo code

61
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:32,503

month. Bonzai! All right.

62
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,419
(cheering)

63
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,641
MATT: That's pretty good! A little Scottish at the
end, though.

64
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:42,080
TALIESIN: Somewhere in Topanga Canyon right now,
Dweezil Zappa is bleeding from the nose, going:

65
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,012
oh! What?! What?!

66
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,367
LAURA: That blonde hair did something for your
complexion, though.

67
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,170
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, you were glowing.

68
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,670
LIAM: No wonder you're in voiceover!

69
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,520
SAM: I mean, we're versatile actors, and I just
want to showcase that to the people!

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,047
MATT: I hope that's a sneak peek of your character
in the next campaign, Sam.

71
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:00,085
SAM: Definitely.

72
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:08,976
MATT: Thank you Loot Crate, thank you Magic Puzzle
Quest-- Check 'em both out, guys. Couple quick

73
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:14,476
announcements! Talks Machina will be up next
Tuesday, and every following Tuesday simulcast

74
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:20,124
both on Twitch and Alpha! So you guys can still
get a chance to watch it, the Alpha supporters

75
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:23,937
will still have all the access to it. It's going
to be awesome, glad you guys get a chance to

76
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:30,669
follow us along with that and to try out the
platform, and enjoy it on Twitch. So yay! So, next

77
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,171
Talks will have a couple guests, which you might
meet later on this evening, will be joining the next

78
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:46,881
episode this Tuesday at 7:00pm here and on Alpha.
You're welcome, Brian. Next up! Next Monday

79
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:52,315
December 12th, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm, there's an
extra special holiday season episode of Dick and

80
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:55,872
Johnson happening here. Dick and Johnson Save
Everything Ultra Holiday Special-- such a specific

81
00:05:55,872 --> 00:06:01,268
title-- going to be a bunch of guests, including
Chloe Dykstra, myself, I will be showing up for a

82
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:05,573
little bit, with some ridiculousness in
characters, so you guys need to check it out if

83
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:10,374
you haven't already, it's-- how do you describe
the game? It's like a shark riding a reindeer

84
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:13,162
shooting a minigun, while waving an American flag
and playing D&amp;D.

85
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,878
TALIESIN: That's a great tattoo.

86
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:20,831
MATT: That's a challenge to you guys. Show us your
pictures of your great amazing Dick and Johnson

87
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:26,512
tattoo. Wherever it may be on your Dick and
Johnson. But tune in next Monday, December 12th,

88
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:30,749
at 4:00 to 6:00pm, check it out, I'll see you
there. All right.

89
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:33,168
SAM: So many announcements.

90
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:38,471
MATT: I know! We're getting there, we're getting
there. New GM Tips came out today!

91
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,133
(cheering)

92
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:45,310
MATT: This week's topic is specifically on running
an evil campaign, and curbing modo-- herber--

93
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,493
murder herber-- murder hobo behavior in games.
Check out the good times. That's out now on

94
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:59,934
YouTube and the Geek and Sundry website. Also, at
the break today, we have a very special video from

95
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:05,458
our good friend Patrick Rothfuss and plays Kerr in
the world, as we're helping support his

96
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,197
Worldbuilders charity, which has been doing
amazing, gangbusters, and they're setting up a

97
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:13,871
specific Critical Role page on that, with a few
prizes that we're providing from our end as well

98
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:18,044
for people that enter and donate, that you can
win. So he's going to put together a video and

99
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:22,777
information about the page will be available very
soon. Go check it out, it's an amazing charity,

100
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:27,223
I've talked about it here before, and the money's
being matched, dollar for dollar, by a number of

101
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:31,617
corporations for everything you donate. So check
out the break for a special message from Patrick

102
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,531
Rothfuss.

103
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:33,880
LIAM: He's a good human being.

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,608
MATT: He's a good man. And he wanted to be here
tonight but he's unfortunately in a-- I say

105
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:45,018
unfortunately-- fortunately in a tux, at the, I
think it's the game-- what? The--

106
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,511
TALIESIN: Gamer's Choice Awards?

107
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:49,763
MATT: No no no no. Child's Play, I think, charity
event tonight.

108
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:53,318
TALIESIN: It's the gamer's Shorty Awards.

109
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:58,352
MATT: So the whole cha-- no, it's the charity!
It's all about charity, apparently. Speaking of

110
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:06,410
charity, we have the pleasure of once again, as a
fantastic example of this community that's sprung

111
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:12,741
up around this channel and this show, so many of
you guys have been so generous, and supporting of

112
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:17,467
all the charities we've spoken of, and other
charities you've gone on to find, we have one

113
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:24,430
amazing Critter who is here tonight, named Mark
Kuro, who has donated an amazing amount to 826LA

114
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,914
in the name of this show--

115
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:28,739
(cheering)

116
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:31,785
MATT: --and you guys, so say hello to Mark
everyone. Mark, I'm blown away by your generosity,

117
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:36,871
and I think it's a fantastic example once again of
the power of community that you've all put

118
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,736
together and helping support other people who
don't have the opportunity.

119
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,014
MARK: Well, and I also want to thank you guys for
the inspiration. I mean, you get to throw

120
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:46,975
inspiration dice around all the time, but when you
do it in the real world, it makes a big

121
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:52,376
difference. So I think 826LA is an amazing
charity, and I think I would do sort of a

122
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:57,631
Christmas Critter Charity Challenge, for all the
Critters out there at this time of year

123
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:01,831
especially, to go ahead and donate to your
favorite charity, donate to 826LA in the name of

124
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:07,901
Critical Role, and again, make a difference.
World's gotten a little wonky, time for love and

125
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,832
generosity is never better than now, so thanks
guys.

126
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,290
MATT: I completely agree. Thank you, Mark. Really
appreciate it, thanks buddy.

127
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,930
MARK: Kill the dragons, he's got to die!

128
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,984
LIAM: He said, he said, Mark said, he's got to
die. He's got to die, Matt, he's got to die.

129
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:24,316
MATT: Well, you know, maybe I gave you a damage bonus, I
don't know. Thank you, Mark.

130
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:30,399
MARISHA: And yeah, and as always, 826LA is
amazing, and there might be a local branch in your

131
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
city, I know there's one in San Francisco, I know
there's one in New York, I know there's one in

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,196
Chicago.

133
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:38,303
TALIESIN: You should totally check it out, you can
also-- they have web stores, and you should go

134
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,349
onto their web stores because there's a lot of
really good Christmas stuff that you can buy

135
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:45,211
that's fun and arty and poetry-ish, and kids
poetry that you can buy books of that's actually

136
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:49,295
really good, and it's a great Christmas gift, and
you're giving to a good cause. It's amazing.

137
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,799
MARISHA: Yeah, it's amazing.

138
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,225
MATT: Hell yeah. Oh, and I forgot to mention this
too, for the Talks Machina announcement too,

139
00:09:56,225 --> 00:10:01,554
while it's remaining on Twitch, also they will have an
enhanced version on Alpha in the new year as well,

140
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:05,252
so you'll have that positive element of it, too,
and get to see what the platform is capable of

141
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:12,758
doing with that show. So. There you go. Spotify
playlists are still rolling out. We had Laura's go

142
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:13,956
up last Friday.

143
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,144
LIAM: It was so good, it was so good!

144
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:17,352
LAURA: Did you think so?

145
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,314
LIAM: I did, I liked it.

146
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,141
LAURA: Is it maybe because you had a song on
there?

147
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,713
LIAM: Well, that's part of it, but the whole thing
was pretty good!

148
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:23,864
LAURA: Thanks, bro.

149
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:25,196
SAM: It's all Debbie Gibson.

150
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:26,658
LAURA: You had a song on there, too, Sam.

151
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:27,414
SAM: I did?

152
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:28,917
LAURA: Yeah, I know you didn't listen to it.

153
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:34,078
SAM: No, I haven't. I will tonight. I'll go down
to Spotify, or Geek and Sundry, or wherever you

154
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:35,267
get them, and--

155
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,673
MARISHA: Did you ever listen to any of the first
playlists that we put out?

156
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:40,262
SAM: Of course I did! I listened to mine.

157
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:43,382
(laughter)

158
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:47,847
LIAM: You are on a show called Critical Role,
where a group of nerdy-ass voice actors--

159
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,718
SAM: My best friends, who I support, by showing
up!

160
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:56,368
(laughter)

161
00:10:56,368 --> 00:11:03,589
SAM: No, I listened to them. I read your little
blurbs. I did, I did those things.

162
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:09,473
LIAM: Oh, I just got the Christmas spirit all up
in my heart. Nice.

163
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,096
TALIESIN: Let's get some seltzer, we'll get that
right out.

164
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,670
MARISHA: Thank you for your click on the Geek and
Sundry website, I guess!

165
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,316
TALIESIN: Just a click, not a like.

166
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:23,463
MATT: And, last--

167
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:25,835
TALIESIN: Who is the Spotify playlist this week?

168
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:26,985
MARISHA: You.

169
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,778
TALIESIN: Oh, it's me? Oh, that's great.

170
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:29,799
SAM: Have you done it yet?

171
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,731
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know I did it, I did do it--
It's good, it's good music.

172
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,521
LIAM: Sam will listen to it in five months.

173
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:43,084
MATT: Last but not least, me and Marisha are
guesting at MagFest in January, 6th to the 8th,

174
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:47,713
MagFest is one of my favorite events and has been
for many years, it's a video-game music festival.

175
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:52,144
We're going to have a bunch of panels over there,
and there's a bunch of great concerts and shows

176
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:56,040
going on, it's a general awesome, fun experience.
If you haven't been before, I recommend it, if you

177
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,507
have been, go again! We'll be there. Come and say
hi.

178
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,106
LAURA: There's also a couple more announcements.

179
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,510
SAM: More and more and more and more.

180
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:09,369
LAURA: I know, I know, but these are good. Well,
last weekend was PSX and there were a couple

181
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:15,990
awesome projects that were announced there, which
is the new Uncharted game! The Lost Legacy! What

182
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,264
what what! I play Nadine, what what what!

183
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,706
(cheering)

184
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:24,349
LAURA: And then, also announced at the same time,
was Last of Us 2, starring one Ashley Johnson, so

185
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:27,091
we're all very very very excited about it--

186
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,462
MATT: Our D&amp;D show book-ended PSX, that's cool,
actually.

187
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:33,116
LAURA: Yeah, it was pretty frickin' cool. And
those are going to be a long time before they're

188
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:38,729
out, but you know, it's still really awesome. And
then! Finishing announcements tonight with some

189
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,425
special, special treats, which is--

190
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:46,427
MATT: I haven't even seen that.

191
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:49,596
LAURA: A Critical Role hat. Yeah, you've been in
here the whole time. This is out, in the store,

192
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:59,364
right now, as well as Critical Role dice! So, I
have heard tell that if you get these ordered-- if

193
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:02,716
you live in the United States, at least, I'm sorry
international Critters-- but if you live in the US

194
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,780
then you should be able to get these before
Christmas!

195
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,819
MARISHA: Yay! Stocking stuffers.

196
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,682
LAURA: Yeah, great stocking stuffers, great under
the tree presents too.

197
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:13,762
LIAM: This is a fine-ass baseball cap. On the
inside it says: How Do You Want To Do This? Oh,

198
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,906
and your head is so small, and my head is so
large.

199
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,758
MARISHA: And it's all embroidered.

200
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:26,308
SAM: And it's perfect for when we play all the
other Dungeons &amp; Dragons Twitch shows in our

201
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:27,647
softball league!

202
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:36,865
LAURA: Right? So we have a certain amount. And I
by the way rolled these dice, before the show, and

203
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,951
I got a critical on my d20, so--

204
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,392
MATT: No guarantee.

205
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:46,625
LAURA: They're in the store right now. There's a
limited amount, obviously, like it always is, but!

206
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,398
As soon as they're gone we're going to order more.
But if you want 'em for Christmas, then you know,

207
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,220
probably get them soon.

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,863
MATT: All righty. I think that's it, right? Okay,
good. Wow. Front-loaded them this week. Thank you

209
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:03,306
for your patience, guys. It's all good! Good
announcements. Good things. Good holiday spirit

210
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:08,298
kicking forward. And in that same spirit of good
positive fun, let's bring it down here into the

211
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:16,451
current dramatic, rocketing conclusion of the
Chroma Conclave, for tonight's episode of Critical Role!

212
00:14:16,451 --> 00:15:50,278
[dramatic music]

213
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,385
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

214
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,493
SAM: A lot happened. A lot happened in that
break.

215
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,394
MATT: Apparently! I missed most of it.

216
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:58,725
LAURA: Pure chaos.

217
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:02,345
MATT: I'm so removed from most events at the
table before the game starts, I'm like: what

218
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:03,887
happened? What?

219
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,021
TALIESIN: Do you phase out so you don't hear the
terrible things we say?

220
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:10,333
MATT: No, I'm focused on the rest of the shit
that's happening tonight. Anyway. So, to get you

221
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:15,329
up to speed, our fantastic band of adventurers,
Vox Machina, had been battling against the Chroma

222
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,181
Conclave, a collection of evil, dangerous
chromatic dragons, led by Thordak, the Cinder

223
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:25,656
King, who has been reigning over their home city
of Emon for quite some time, terrorising the

224
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:32,413
community, and apparently slowly undergoing a
change based on the elemental stone that is

225
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:38,143
embedded in his body that once locked him into the
Plane of Fire. You've defeated most of the

226
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,931
dragons, and allied yourself with one of the only
remaining members, Raishan, the green dragon. You

227
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:49,643
guys have since acquired a number of allies, you
made your way to the Fire Plane to the City of

228
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:55,227
Brass, you returned to find Fort Daxio under
attack. You managed to defend it, you saved a few

229
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,039
friends, returned to Whitestone, and it seems like
everything is gearing itself towards the final

230
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:05,940
conflict in Emon, with Thordak the Cinder King.
Last we left off, you were meeting underneath

231
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,645
Whitestone at the ziggurat, with the current
standing council, the War Council, of both

232
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:18,699
Whitestone and this entire endeavor. You decided a
couple of people to come with you, and now is your

233
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:26,526
time to spend the next day or so wisely, as the
army from Fort Daxio and Syngorn will be arriving

234
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:33,515
at Emon by about sundown the following day. Your
airship was in transit to Daxio, and has been

235
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:37,737
rerouted to Emon as well. Everyone is converging
to the city. What do you want to do to prepare?

236
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:39,654
LAURA: Oh god, it's all happening!

237
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:41,237
MARISHA: Okay. They're all going to the city.

238
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,284
LAURA: So, what time of day is it right now?

239
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:46,755
MATT: Right now, I'd say about mid-afternoon.

240
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,284
MARISHA: Are we still down by the ziggurat?

241
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:53,823
MATT: Yeah, you guys just finished your meeting at
the ziggurat.

242
00:17:53,823 --> 00:18:01,159
TALIESIN: I have some guns to repair, because
everything broke, and many of these things cost

243
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,323
money now.

244
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,219
MATT: Yeah.

245
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:05,704
SAM: That's small picture. We're big picture.

246
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:12,574
LIAM: How long is the trip, did we say? To get to
Emon from here.

247
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,589
SAM: Instant for us.

248
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,591
LAURA: Well, we have to go through a tree.

249
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:19,194
SAM: Or a teleportation circle.

250
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:21,748
LIAM: Then we're meeting with Dad?

251
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:24,936
LAURA: Yeah, he's marching to Emon right now.

252
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:31,809
MARISHA: Are we going to have a meeting spot
outside of Emon? We should probably have a plan.

253
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:37,189
TALIESIN: We should probably get close to
Greyskull and see if we can enter through the

254
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:38,169
tunnels.

255
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,652
LIAM: I think that's our way, yeah.

256
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:46,825
SAM: Yes, but we do have to rally with your pops,
and also didn't we cut loose 55 soldiers to wander

257
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,605
free in the desert from Daxio?

258
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,892
LAURA: They're meeting the other armies.

259
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,837
SAM: They're just going to form up?

260
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:55,461
LAURA: Trust in them. They're soldiers, they'll be
able to find their way.

261
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:59,028
SAM: Right. But can we scry and figure out where
this other army is? Maybe we'll go there? Or maybe

262
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:03,382
we should scry on our old keep and go there. Those
seem like two good locations.

263
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:08,168
TALIESIN: I think scrying on the old keep and then
letting everyone know-- we don't necessarily want

264
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:12,582
everyone arriving at the same place as well, as
long as there's a coordinated movement towards the city.

265
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:16,360
LAURA: They can all start attacking and we can
come in from the bottom.

266
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,122
SAM: Sure, but we've told the approaching army
nothing about any plan whatsoever.

267
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,240
TALIESIN: We can call them if we need to.

268
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,899
MARISHA: So we probably want different regiments
flanking the city in different areas?

269
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,611
TALIESIN: And then maybe the 50 men coming into
the sewers to fight.

270
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:39,134
LIAM: I feel like we want to catch up with our
father's army before they're anywhere near the

271
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:43,418
walls of the city, because, well, that'd be
stupid.

272
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,840
TALIESIN: We can go meet them if that's the next
move.

273
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,470
SAM: And strategize when we get there? Once we see
their forces, and what they have to offer?

274
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,497
MARISHA: Percy, do you still have that map of
Emon?

275
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,939
TALIESIN: Yes, somewhere.

276
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:02,996
LAURA: We should probably talk to Gilmore as well,
and let him know that he has to fucking join us.

277
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:07,467
MARISHA: That he drew the short straw. We
drew the short straw for him.

278
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:11,586
TALIESIN: We should also collect some other
allies, if we're going to head in this direction.

279
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,533
LAURA: Of course.

280
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,352
SAM: All right. Do you want to go talk to Gilmore,
Vaxy-poo?

281
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:21,612
TALIESIN: We're going to need a painter, you know
a painter, we should bring a painter with us.

282
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,159
SAM: A painter? To paint our exploits?

283
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,448
TALIESIN: Yes, to paint our exploits. You have
that portrait--

284
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,178
MARISHA: Once again, Percy, I feel like that's
small picture--

285
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:30,246
TALIESIN: Is it small potatoes? Is it really,
though?

286
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:34,670
LIAM: We could find a jeweller right now. If
that's what you're into.

287
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,948
SAM: I have a man at a casino that I really need
to get revenge on.

288
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:45,250
TALIESIN: You might as well get it all done now,
because you're not going to be able to do it later.

289
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,080
MARISHA: 24 hours left alive!

290
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,506
LIAM: Kynan? Kynan!

291
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,894
SAM: All right.

292
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:55,884
TALIESIN: But no, stock up on what-- again,
Whitestone doesn't necessarily have a lot for us

293
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:57,498
to gather--

294
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:00,902
SAM: But we should bring any potions. How we doing
on potions? Did you ever divvy up our last several

295
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:01,782
potions?

296
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,900
LAURA: I did divvy up our last potions, I feel
like it might be smart to get some more, but the

297
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,758
only place to really buy any is Vasselheim.

298
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:07,907
SAM: Is that true?

299
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:14,944
LAURA: I mean it's the only city still standing
that we have access to immediately. We don't have

300
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:21,446
a lot of time. The thing is, I feel like people in
Vasselheim said they would help us, but I don't

301
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,222
know how they'd get to Emon to help us in time.

302
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:28,687
SAM: I know, an airship! Oh shit, where's our
airship?

303
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,102
LAURA: It's on its way.

304
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,532
SAM: To where?

305
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:32,841
LIAM: Emon. To Emon.

306
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,479
SAM: Did we say Emon, or did we say Daxio?

307
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:38,049
MATT: It was on its way to Daxio--

308
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,058
MARISHA: They're redirecting to Emon.

309
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:44,526
SAM: Thank God. We're sending it to a dragon instead
of a fort on fire.

310
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:47,918
TALIESIN: It does have weaponry.

311
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:50,383
LAURA: Yeah. It's made to take on things attacking
it.

312
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:52,282
TALIESIN: It's designed to help keep him on the
ground.

313
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:55,241
MARISHA: Uh-huh, yeah, it's a giant balloon in the
air--

314
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,744
LAURA: It's not a balloon, actually--

315
00:21:56,744 --> 00:22:01,115
TALIESIN: Well, no, it's a giant crystal. It's-- I
know I keep saying--

316
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:04,412
MARISHA: I always think of it as a high-tech
Hindenberg.

317
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,122
TALIESIN: I know. Please don't say that. That's
not funny.

318
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:09,169
LIAM: That's a metaphor for Vox Machina.

319
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,594
MATT: There you go. If there ever was one, yeah.

320
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:18,684
SAM: All right. Besides gathering our forces here,
gathering our potions here, and telling Gilmore,

321
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:24,299
where are we going? Let's put it to a vote, as we
always do, democratically. Grog?

322
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,371
MATT: "Yes?"

323
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:34,517
SAM: Grog, where would you like to go? To the army
waiting just outside of Emon, or to our old ratty

324
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:36,183
keep with nothing in it?

325
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:38,364
TALIESIN: "I'd like to go to the--" I don't know.

326
00:22:38,364 --> 00:22:39,963
LAURA: I don't know what he wants.

327
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:41,677
MATT: Percy's getting a little strange off to the
side.

328
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:50,640
LAURA: Wait, Travis is watching, so he can just
text in, yeah. Grog is thinking about it. Grog is

329
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,857
thinking really hard.

330
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:57,938
MATT: He considers it for a second and goes,
"Whatever makes me kill things faster."

331
00:22:57,938 --> 00:22:59,231
LAURA: That's good.

332
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,532
MARISHA: Wait, have we rested?

333
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:06,021
MATT: You did rest before coming here. You spent
the evening in Fort Daxio.

334
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,597
MARISHA: And then we teleported. No, Allura
brought us here.

335
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:17,994
SAM: Okay, putting it to a vote. Three choices.
Ready? To your dad, to our keep, or to Vasselheim.

336
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:20,576
I don't know why, but it's been mentioned.

337
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,629
MARISHA: Hang on, I can scry on our keep.

338
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:31,427
LAURA: Can't Allura send a message to them and let
them know what our plan is, and then we don't have

339
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:33,033
to actually bamf there?

340
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,682
SAM: We don't have a plan!

341
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:38,481
TALIESIN: Wherever we go, we can let everyone know
what the plan and where we're going is.

342
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:44,835
LAURA: I feel like what we need to do-- okay,
here's what I think our plan should be.

343
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:47,007
SAM: Lead us, O Mighty Vex.

344
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:54,688
LAURA: I feel like we should tell the armies
gathering to prepare to attack. We enter in where

345
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:56,506
the Clasp is; we come in from the bottom up.

346
00:23:56,506 --> 00:24:00,174
SAM: So they're going to create a diversion for
us?

347
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:04,119
LAURA: Exactly. They take on the armies while we
head straight to Thordak.

348
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:07,989
LIAM: Dad creates a shit-storm at the wall, and we
take advantage of that chaos.

349
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,430
SAM: We have to communicate this to them.

350
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,642
TALIESIN: Easy to do. We just send a message.

351
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:15,129
LAURA: We could send a message, or we could bamf
there and then bamf another place. It seems a lot

352
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:16,669
of time wasted.

353
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,239
TALIESIN: Yeah, easier just to send a message.

354
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:23,517
MATT: Allura has been in communication and has
been the information hub between most of these

355
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:24,782
individuals.

356
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:29,222
LIAM: How long did we say before Syldor reaches
Emon?

357
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:31,790
MATT: By about dusk the following day.

358
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,095
LIAM: Dusk the following day. And you said
afternoon right now? So a little more than 24 hours.

359
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:40,412
TALIESIN: We can at least get into there and start
communicating with the Clasp.

360
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,619
MARISHA: We're not really in good standing with
them.

361
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,516
TALIESIN: I'm sure they'll be happy to see us,
regardless.

362
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:53,276
MARISHA: You think? I guess. Sure. It's like
seeing that person you hated in high school after

363
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:57,541
something terrible just happened. Happy for the
familiarity.

364
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:01,329
SAM: But now they're a little bit overweight and
they work in an Applebee's.

365
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,752
MARISHA: Sure, and it's a little gratifying?

366
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,949
SAM: Yeah.

367
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:08,786
LIAM: They can hate us, and we can deal with that
afterward, if there is even an afterward.

368
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,270
TALIESIN: They're businessmen; I doubt they hold
grudges.

369
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,541
LAURA: I'm sure they hold grudges.

370
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,654
TALIESIN: Not until after the dragon's been taken
care of.

371
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:16,976
LAURA: Then they'll make us pay?

372
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:20,396
TALIESIN: Yes. It's not profitable to kill us
before the dragon is dead.

373
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:28,288
LIAM: Also, somewhere in all this fracas, we need
you to take care of us with food.

374
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,531
TALIESIN: When it's time.

375
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,845
LIAM: Right, when is the time?

376
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,139
TALIESIN: I think once we're there.

377
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,576
MARISHA: It lasts for 24 hours.

378
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,706
LAURA: Before we head in.

379
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,541
LIAM: In the keep, for old time's sake?

380
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,472
LAURA: I don't think that's very smart.

381
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,830
TALIESIN: Or in the sewers, for old time's sake.

382
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,512
(laughter)

383
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,752
LIAM: I mean underneath.

384
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:54,413
TALIESIN: Hopefully, in the keep.

385
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:56,051
SAM: So we have a clear plan, then?

386
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:57,906
TALIESIN: We have a plan for dinner.

387
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,507
LIAM: There's no guarantees, Scanlan.

388
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:04,163
SAM: Where are we going? That's all I care about
right now.

389
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:08,879
LIAM: We're going to hell. Where do you think
we're going? It's going to be fucking awful.

390
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,815
You're probably going to be dead in 48 hours.

391
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:14,627
SAM: Yeah, but we'll be together, and I don't
think that I'll die.

392
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:16,147
LIAM: You're adorable.

393
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:19,043
TALIESIN: You're going to be in front, if
anything.

394
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,792
MARISHA: This is the worst of two extremes.

395
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,791
TALIESIN: You should scry on Greyskull.

396
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,634
MARISHA: Is anyone still there?

397
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:32,065
SAM: Last time I looked in, there was some
movement, or it looked like people had recently

398
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,169
been there.

399
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,908
MARISHA: Wasn't it Drexel? Dranzel?

400
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:38,962
SAM: Nope, they're off somewhere else.

401
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:46,381
LAURA: You said by sunset tomorrow is when they'll
be at Emon?

402
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:50,221
MATT: That's when they'll be there and ready.

403
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,692
LAURA: Okay.

404
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:58,071
MATT: If you want more information, you might have
to talk to somebody who has that information.

405
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:03,381
LAURA: Right. What we need to do is plan a time
that they start the attack.

406
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:11,068
SAM: Sure. We've got to get there first and suss
it out, too. We haven't done any recon. This army

407
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:16,405
of your father's, we have no idea how big it is,
if they have archers, if they have an elite SWAT

408
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:17,966
team task force--

409
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:20,275
TALIESIN: How do you feel that will affect our
plan?

410
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:24,445
SAM: If we know we have an elite SWAT team task
force, we can take them down with us into the

411
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:25,390
sewers!

412
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,536
TALIESIN: I can almost promise you they do not
have an elite SWAT team task force.

413
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:31,643
LAURA: They might have some stealthy--

414
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:33,198
TALIESIN: Some stealthy individuals.

415
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:34,924
MARISHA: We have friends of our own.

416
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:41,023
SAM: Also, if we do any recon, we might know that
oh, there's a big thing we need to have taken out

417
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:45,313
before we can even get in. What if our keep is
being surrounded?

418
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:50,603
MARISHA: Okay. Hang on. Let me scry on the keep.
This will answer plenty of questions, and then

419
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:51,687
we'll go from there.

420
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:52,908
LAURA: Scry away, Keyleth.

421
00:27:52,908 --> 00:28:01,331
MARISHA: Did we leave Laina there? Did we leave
anyone there, or is it completely vacated?

422
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:04,590
LIAM: It was chaos when we left.

423
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,105
MATT: Yeah, it was absolute chaos. You pushed your
servants through. Your staff still currently

424
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,773
exists somewhere in Whitestone.

425
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,576
MARISHA: I can't scry on a building, correct?

426
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:14,796
MATT: Correct.

427
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:17,358
LIAM: We fought Vorugal and then high-tailed it
out of there; inside and gone.

428
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,868
MARISHA: I can't scry on a building.

429
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,317
TALIESIN: Can you scry on a plant?

430
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,872
SAM: Can you scry on a dead thing?

431
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,779
MARISHA: Can I scry on a plant?

432
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,436
TALIESIN: There is a tree.

433
00:28:28,436 --> 00:28:33,117
MATT: Because you are a druid, being a
nature-based entity and it is a living

434
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:34,672
creature...

435
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,555
(laughter)

436
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,624
MATT: Don't steal my thunder!

437
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:42,292
MARISHA: One that I've had personal communications
with.

438
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:48,735
MATT: I would say, due to the fact that you are a
druid and nature is your basis, if it is a

439
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,817
specific plant-based entity that you are very
familiar with, sure.

440
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,618
SAM: Do we have anything like that at our keep?

441
00:28:53,618 --> 00:29:00,386
MATT: You have a number of trees in the front; you
have the garden that you built in Sarenrae's

442
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:01,462
temple.

443
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:03,854
MARISHA: That's what I want to scry on. I want to
start there.

444
00:29:03,854 --> 00:29:04,806
MATT: Okay.

445
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:08,743
MARISHA: You know how it's always, "you zoom in
really fast, and you zoom in really fast--" Can I

446
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:10,698
slow down?

447
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:15,227
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

448
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:18,003
MARISHA: I can't pull focus?

449
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:25,179
MATT: In theory, scrying is only supposed to show
you what's there. I narratively let a little bit

450
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,649
of a journey happen. You can't control the
journey, sorry.

451
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:28,934
SAM: DVR it.

452
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,526
MARISHA: It's the worst. Okay.

453
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:37,546
MATT: All right, so where are you doing the
spell?

454
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:39,100
MARISHA: Where?

455
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,943
MATT: Where are you doing your Scry ritual?

456
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:43,396
MARISHA: Not near the ziggurat, if we're still
there.

457
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,513
MATT: Right, so are you guys heading back to the
castle, then?

458
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:46,914
LAURA: Yeah, let's go to the castle.

459
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:54,912
MATT: While you guys are heading back to the
castle from underneath the tunnels, you are

460
00:29:54,912 --> 00:30:04,284
briefly headed off by a familiar dwarven fellow in
robes and a crystalline staff: Elementalist Drake

461
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:13,249
Thunderbrand. "By the way, before you leave, we've
been working on a few things for you. They should

462
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:17,631
"be of assistance to you. Come find me in the
common room whenever you're ready."

463
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:22,096
SAM: Yeah, sure. Wow, fortuitous.

464
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:23,355
MARISHA: I like presents.

465
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:33,557
MATT: You head to your quarters to do the Scry
spell? Okay. Your vision clarifies on dark clouds.

466
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:42,968
Your vision sees a gathering of grayish mists, and
you slowly transition through them to see shapes

467
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:51,812
that are either extremely small or extremely
distant. Your vision begins to funnel through it

468
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:55,153
quickly, like you're passing over the edge of a
waterfall.

469
00:30:55,153 --> 00:31:01,246
There's a rush, and you see, as the clouds
dissipate, a glimpse of the overhead of Emon. You

470
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:09,161
see the once-gleaming city of white across the
Bladeshimmer Shoreline pockmarked with black and

471
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:17,816
tall towers of curling black smoke. You see flames
that still burn unfettered, unstopped throughout

472
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:25,521
the town, and what looks from the distance like
small clouds of gnats or flies that you realize

473
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:32,027
are much larger flying entities doing small passes
over various neighborhoods to keep watch or find food.

474
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:38,847
Your vision jumps again, this time careening down
even faster. Below, you can see, from an overhead

475
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:46,108
view, Greyskull Keep. You begin to rush in that
direction, and as it gets closer, you can see the

476
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:51,371
same damage it took from the wall from the initial
attack of the Conclave. You see elements of rubble

477
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:57,237
around the outside, though it's still pristine,
being repaired by the celestial entity that was

478
00:31:57,237 --> 00:31:59,865
summoned by Pike shortly after.

479
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:06,767
Your vision jumps again, this time through the
repaired stained-glass exterior of the temple of

480
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:13,114
Sarenrae, and it comes to rest there in a moment,
amongst the strangely contrasting, peaceful

481
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:20,570
greenery of this temple. There's such a sense of
hopelessness and horror on the outside of the

482
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,525
city, this one little moment of time here is
almost like a time capsule of how things were

483
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,633
before. It's sad, but hopeful at the same time.

484
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:36,027
As your vision swivels over to the tree, there in
the temple, while contained here for as long as

485
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:45,132
it's been, it seems to be healthy. Looking in the
vicinity, most everything seems in place.

486
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:49,572
MARISHA: Do the trees look overgrown? Do the
plants look overgrown?

487
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:56,024
MATT: As much as being away for the handful of
months that you have been. They look like they

488
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,671
haven't been trimmed or tended to recently.

489
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:04,140
MARISHA: And the temple is intact? It looks like
the keep is still intact from where we rebuilt it?

490
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,428
MATT: Correct. It has not fallen.

491
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,690
MARISHA: Do I sense any movement?

492
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,177
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
through your Scry spell.

493
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:19,330
TALIESIN: No, I can't help. Yeah, no.

494
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:27,209
MARISHA: I rolled two ones. Both ones. I'll say
that's just flushing it out.

495
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:33,164
MATT: Strangely, somehow through a Scry spell,
something got in your eye in the temple.

496
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:37,617
MARISHA: I hate it when the VR goggles short out.

497
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:40,661
(laughter)

498
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:46,573
MATT: You don't know if it's divine energy
interference or what, but it stings a lot, and you

499
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:51,881
feel the essence of the spell begin to shiver and
quake, and as you try and clear your vision

500
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:53,626
through, it remains blurred.

501
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,212
MARISHA: Shit.

502
00:33:55,212 --> 00:34:01,779
MATT: You're still there; your presence is there,
but you don't have the capability of seeing

503
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:06,837
anything beyond the tree you're focused on. The
Scry spell is focused on the tree, and everything

504
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:12,636
around it has this hazy fog-of-war feel about five
feet beyond it.

505
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:16,389
SAM: Good scry.

506
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,417
MARISHA: Good scry, guys. Good scry.

507
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:24,004
LAURA: What did you see? Anything good? Are we
safe?

508
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:35,733
MARISHA: It's still standing, for the most part. I
saw Pike's-- wait, her celestial being wasn't

509
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:36,930
still there.

510
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:41,115
MATT: No, it was temporarily summoned for the
reconstruction of the ceiling portion.

511
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:44,466
MARISHA: Looks okay. Looks like home.

512
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,526
LIAM: Still standing? There wasn't anybody around
it?

513
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,161
MARISHA: I couldn't tell.

514
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,527
SAM: How's my comic book collection? Is it still
there?

515
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,264
MARISHA: Burned.

516
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,030
TALIESIN: Mint in box.

517
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,364
LIAM: That's as close to a guarantee as we're
going to get.

518
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:59,121
MARISHA: I told you to get a fire box.

519
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,239
LAURA: Do you think Drake would join us?

520
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:06,715
SAM: Who? Little guy? I'd like to be the shortest
on this trip, please.

521
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:07,826
LAURA: Got it.

522
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:09,054
LIAM: You are.

523
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,480
SAM: Oh.

524
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,223
MARISHA: Where's Kash?

525
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:14,844
LAURA: And Zahra?

526
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:18,518
MARISHA: Kash was really mad at us last time we
talked to him.

527
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:20,054
LAURA: So maybe we shouldn't ask him.

528
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:21,392
TALIESIN: Let's not.

529
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,887
MARISHA: I talked to him last time.

530
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:27,980
LAURA: I don't even want Kash to come. I don't
even want him around.

531
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,535
SAM: When we walk near his residence, let's walk
around.

532
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:36,948
LIAM: That guy is a badass motherfucker, and we do
want him.

533
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:40,535
SAM: I know why <i>you</i> want him to come.

534
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:42,133
LIAM: Well, he's got those brown eyes.

535
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,751
LAURA: No, he's got one brown eye and one blue
eye, I think.

536
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,606
TALIESIN: We are this loopy because we're
genuinely terrified, and we're doing everything

537
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:50,544
we can not to go.

538
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,287
LIAM: It's called gallows humor.

539
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:55,300
LAURA: I'm going to go ask Zahra if she'll join
us. Can I go talk to Zahra?

540
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,516
MATT: Sure.

541
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,804
LIAM: I'll go find Shaun, after her.

542
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:03,201
MARISHA: You guys are forcing me into going and
talking to Kash, aren't you?

543
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:05,284
LAURA: Scanlan can ask him. It doesn't have to be
you.

544
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:06,528
MARISHA: Scanlan?

545
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,430
SAM: Would you prefer me to go? We do have a
rapport.

546
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,897
LAURA: I do want to ask Jarett to come too,
though.

547
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:14,917
SAM: Oh, I need to go see Jarett.

548
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:20,542
(laughter)

549
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:24,263
SAM: You're on Kash duty, Kiki.

550
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:26,838
LIAM: Scanlan, do you need a little resolve for
this fight?

551
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:35,256
SAM: I just want to see Jarett. He's our most
solid ally, and most dependable friend.

552
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:37,069
LIAM: There's no other reason?

553
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,807
SAM: He's been there for us in our time of need.

554
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,557
LIAM: Still no other reason?

555
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:45,004
SAM: I feel like it would be a big pick-me-up to
see him.

556
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:48,400
(laughter)

557
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,818
LIAM: Solid. You do that.

558
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:58,254
TALIESIN: I'm going to talk to Cassandra about one
last dip into the vaults to see if there's any

559
00:36:58,254 --> 00:37:03,644
potions. We know we have to leave them with
something in case everything goes wrong, but

560
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:09,352
anything we can take with us will be helpful, and
then I have to fix this giant mess of parts that

561
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:15,638
are currently in my bag. I may need to spend a
little money. I do apologize.

562
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:17,232
LAURA: Darling.

563
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:21,468
TALIESIN: Okay, just letting you know. It might be
a bit expensive to get everything working again.

564
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:24,272
LIAM: Percy, spend it all.

565
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,370
TALIESIN: I will not spend it all. I promise.

566
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,640
LAURA: I gave an entire bag of jewels to a random
efreet.

567
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,162
TALIESIN: That was brazen, yes.

568
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:39,536
MARISHA: We got armor out of it, though. It's not
like we didn't get something from it.

569
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:45,415
TALIESIN: If anyone asks about the plan, the plan
is chaos, if everyone agrees with this. We want to

570
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:52,643
break up their forces as much as possible. We want
them sending ten percent of their forces to every

571
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:59,236
edge of the city. They know where we're going;
they know we're eventually heading to the center,

572
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:05,968
and he's not going to leave anymore, but we're
going to make it very difficult for them. They're

573
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:11,169
either going to be fighting us in every corner, or
they're going to be letting the entire city fall

574
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,525
back to us.

575
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,831
LAURA: I'm going to go find Zahra.

576
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:17,602
SAM: Splitting the party five ways.

577
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:18,992
MARISHA: I go find Kash.

578
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:27,164
MATT: Okay. Vex, as you progress up to the
secondary floor to the outside of Zahra's room,

579
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:29,820
the door is closed.

580
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,982
LAURA: Zahra, dear?

581
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:36,334
MATT: Zahra, you hear a knock at your door.

582
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,123
MARY: Hello?

583
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:41,077
(laughter)

584
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:43,354
MARY: What is it, darling? I'm trying to sleep.

585
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,265
LAURA: Oh!

586
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:50,370
SAM: This is where the live studio audience is
supposed to applaud.

587
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,976
(laughter)

588
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:58,107
MARISHA: You had one job, pit crew.

589
00:38:58,107 --> 00:38:59,891
TALIESIN: You had five jobs--

590
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:03,393
MATT: You had 12 jobs, pit crew.

591
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:05,147
MARY: Anything in my eyes?

592
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:08,536
LAURA: Not much time to sleep, I'm afraid.

593
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:11,816
MARY: Unfortunately, I've been buried in books.

594
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:17,109
LAURA: Yes, and plans are moving ahead much
faster than we anticipated.

595
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:23,459
MARY: First off, I heard word about a white
dragon. Sister killer!

596
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,681
(laughter)

597
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:33,778
MARY: Yes, we have to go get tattoos. Tell me,
what's the news? Catch me up.

598
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:36,333
LAURA: We're marching on Emon tomorrow.

599
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:40,136
MARY: Oh! I was going to get my hair done. All
right.

600
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:42,833
LAURA: That's how it is. All the way.

601
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:51,159
MARY: I haven't heard much. I've been reading,
I've been decorating, and I've been enchanting and

602
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,538
making things. Tell me, what's the news with
Thordak?

603
00:39:54,538 --> 00:40:01,829
LAURA: Well, he's terrible. He's even worse than
we thought. Armies are marching on the city, and we plan

604
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:10,160
on coming in from underneath, maybe striking at
him where he doesn't realize. And we'd like your

605
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,356
help, if you're willing.

606
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:20,113
MARY: I don't think so. Oh, all right. Yes, I'd
love to. I would love to. I've been craving dragon

607
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:23,361
meat since Rimefang, so yes.

608
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:33,461
LAURA: I don't know if we'll succeed, and I'm sure
we won't all make it out alive. It's a big ask.

609
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:40,430
MARY: (sighs) Isn't death supposed to be a
wonderful adventure, as well?

610
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,767
LAURA: I think so.

611
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:45,476
MARY: Fuck it.

612
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,901
LAURA: Fuck it.

613
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:55,089
MARY: Fuck it. Durr 'n' durr. Fuck it. Let's
do it. Yeah, all right. I've been

614
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,044
sitting for too long; I need some action.

615
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,428
LAURA: Did you make any dragon arrows?

616
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:03,389
MARISHA: Buy her a drink first.

617
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:05,622
MARY: I'll get back to you on it.

618
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:09,320
LAURA: I plan on it. So many drinks.

619
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,526
MARY: What next? What do we do?

620
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:22,431
LAURA: We prepare tonight, and we leave tomorrow,
I assume. You know us; we don't have a plan,

621
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:26,421
really. I have no idea what's going on. Be
prepared.

622
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:32,452
MARY: Isn't that the secret to adulthood, that we're
all winging it? Yes, all right. Good.

623
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:35,085
LAURA: I'm glad you're joining.

624
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:37,336
MARY: Darling, I'm with you wherever you go.

625
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:48,930
MATT: With your recently joined into your crusade
tiefling ally, you go to gather the rest of your party.

626
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:53,424
Who's going to Kashaw?

627
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:57,307
(laughter)

628
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,415
TALIESIN: Kiki, what are you doing?

629
00:41:59,415 --> 00:42:09,466
MATT: You take a long, slow, careful walk down
through town to the guard barracks.

630
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:14,053
MARISHA: I try not to step on any cracks in the
sidewalk on the way. It's very important.

631
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:20,173
MATT: It's a warmer and more humid day than you're
used to in Whitestone. A couple of insects are out

632
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:24,585
and about. There's a lot of aspects of Whitestone
that you're noticing for the first time, because

633
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:32,031
you really want to focus on anything else, and yet
suddenly, without warning, you stop and realize

634
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:38,815
you're standing right outside of the barracks. You
see that recently there had been a finished

635
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:44,038
training session with the up-and-coming guard, and
there, sitting off to the side, partially

636
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:47,816
armored and currently sharpening the edge of his
spear, is Kashaw.

637
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,127
MARISHA: He's on the outside? Oh shit.

638
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:51,940
MATT: And he's watching you.

639
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,038
(laughter)

640
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:59,490
MATT: Kashaw?

641
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,257
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen.

642
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:06,756
(cheering and applause)

643
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:19,094
MARISHA: I drop to one knee and start tying my
boot. I start retying my shoe.

644
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:26,065
WILL: You're five feet from me. Am I not supposed
to see that?

645
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:31,213
MARISHA: Oh my god! Kash! Whoa, I didn't see you
there.

646
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:34,464
WILL: Really? Interesting. It was the looking at
me that threw me.

647
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:40,546
MARISHA: Sorry, I've had something in my eye ever
since this scrying spell earlier. Shit's been

648
00:43:40,546 --> 00:43:45,319
blurry. Yeah, no. You're clearly in focus now.

649
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:47,894
WILL: Okay.

650
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:52,291
MARISHA: Hi. Hey, how's it going, man?

651
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,367
WILL: Everything's been great. Life's been
awesome. What can I help you with?

652
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:59,769
(laughter)

653
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:06,667
MARISHA: Okay, Kash, I'm sensing a little bit of
underlying aggression.

654
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,364
WILL: Really? It's underlying?

655
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:11,835
(laughter)

656
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:16,609
MARISHA: Okay, look. I know we fucked you. Look.

657
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:22,710
WILL: Why don't you send me out to get some milk
and go save the world while I'm out there doing

658
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,094
that? What's up there, lady? What? What do you
want? Speak!

659
00:44:26,094 --> 00:44:40,154
MARISHA: (stammers) I'm trying to think of what to
say. Please help us! We're going to die, and we

660
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:44,138
need you. I'm sorry!

661
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:50,134
WILL: I've got nothing to that. Help you what,
first of all.

662
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:54,109
MARISHA: Okay, you know how we've been hunting
down those dragons?

663
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,198
WILL: I vaguely remember it, yes.

664
00:44:56,198 --> 00:45:03,317
MARISHA: We've been doing an okay job, because
we've killed a few, but now there's the big one

665
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:09,040
that's left, Thordak, and then we might be working
with the one that killed all my people, if you

666
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,674
remember that there was one that killed them, so
now we're working with her, and we're gathering an

667
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:25,231
entire army, and we need as many talented and
charming and gifted people that we can get, so I

668
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:32,997
thought-- I'm really sorry we made you be an errand
boy. I didn't vote for that, by the way. I was

669
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,859
trying to--

670
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:38,659
WILL: Keep babbling. This is fun.

671
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:44,614
LAURA: I'm sweating for her.

672
00:45:44,614 --> 00:45:47,836
(laughter)

673
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:52,134
SAM: This is just how the Patrick Rothfuss
conversation went.

674
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:56,010
MARY: This is how it's going to go with you and
Jarett.

675
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,152
WILL: Why should I help you? Give me one reason.

676
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:03,892
MARISHA: Why did you bring back Vex?

677
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:06,832
WILL: Because I thought Vax would kill me if I
didn't.

678
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:09,741
MARISHA: Maybe Vax will kill you if you don't help
us.

679
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:13,134
WILL: Now I'm not really that scared of him.

680
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:20,583
MARISHA: That's not true. You did it because
you're a good person. You ultimately want to see

681
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:26,321
change in the world. I know you do. And I know you
care, even though you pretend like you don't. So

682
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:27,535
that's why.

683
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,608
WILL: In all fairness, dragons bring change.

684
00:46:29,608 --> 00:46:42,481
MARISHA: Kash, that's not the type of change--
there are better ways to bring change than through

685
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:45,659
death and destruction.

686
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:48,100
WILL: Who else is helping you?

687
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,770
MARISHA: Everyone, and then Zahra.

688
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,686
WILL: Z? I'm in. Where is she?

689
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,546
MARISHA: Wow.

690
00:46:56,546 --> 00:47:02,762
WILL: Let's go. Where is she?

691
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:10,372
MARISHA: Should have led with that. All right,
let's go. This way. Glad I spilled my soul and

692
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:15,138
everything, and I just splashed coffee in my face. Come
on, Kash. Come on!

693
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:17,010
WILL: On my way. Let's go.

694
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,320
MATT: All right, as you gather your implements
of war and your supplies you may need for

695
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,589
this journey, you two head back to the castle, a
nice, solid six feet between you as you walk.

696
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:30,162
WILL: I'm hitting the wall constantly over here.

697
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:37,087
LAURA: I can't scooch any more!

698
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,669
LIAM: You don't have any guests over there.

699
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,907
MARY: We got it!

700
00:47:41,907 --> 00:47:43,357
WILL: You comfortable over there?

701
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:44,862
MARY: You got enough room, Sam?

702
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,399
TALIESIN: We're working on getting a bigger cup.

703
00:47:47,399 --> 00:47:50,061
MARY: There's no swiveling.

704
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:55,408
SAM: I'm going to give a seat just to my cup,
because we have the space here to do it.

705
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:58,303
LAURA: We're turning into one person.

706
00:47:58,303 --> 00:48:02,008
MARY: The twinsies will finally be conjoined.

707
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:05,110
LAURA: Sorry.

708
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:17,401
MATT: Scanlan, you are off looking for Jarett. Go
ahead and make an investigation check.

709
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:23,520
SAM: 18. 28.

710
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:31,963
MATT: 28. All right. You know exactly the type of
people that he talks to. Because he's been put in

711
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:38,550
this position of power within the guard hierarchy
here in Whitestone, within the Pale Guard, there's

712
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:43,564
really only three people that he hangs with. One
of them's Kashaw. One of them's a guy who you

713
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:47,635
never remember the name of, who's fun. That's the
guy you're going to go bother. You go and talk to

714
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:53,959
him for a bit, and he points to one of the few
currently functioning, non-destroyed taverns in

715
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:59,492
Whitestone. There you find him sitting there
drinking alone; not heavy drinking, in his cups,

716
00:48:59,492 --> 00:49:03,506
but staring off at the wall and sipping a midday
ale.

717
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:06,852
SAM: Friend Jarett.

718
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:14,069
MATT: "Ah. It is good to see you alive and-- right.
Hi."

719
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:21,660
SAM: Just coming to check on my main man J-money.
It's J, right?

720
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:26,761
MATT: "It is, yes. Otherwise, it would be
Garett."

721
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:28,434
SAM: You're right.

722
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:38,325
MATT: "I'm good. I'm a little nervous, to be
honest. I like to shoot things from a wall. I

723
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:43,519
"don't like to go through a wall to shoot things,
and that's been happening a lot recently, and from

724
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,055
"what I've been hearing, tomorrow is looking to be
a very big day."

725
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:52,773
SAM: Well, it's going to be quite a fight. Can we
count on you to come with us, perhaps?

726
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:58,073
MATT: "I'd assume that would be the case. I would
not want to have all of you disappear into

727
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:05,013
"darkness and fire without me yelling behind you,
'don't die!' I figure that's the very least I

728
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:07,116
"could offer for this circumstance."

729
00:50:07,116 --> 00:50:14,539
SAM: We would be honored to have you with us, and
as you are still technically our employee,

730
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:17,887
there'll be a bonus for you at the end of it.

731
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:19,568
MATT: "Another bonus?"

732
00:50:19,568 --> 00:50:25,123
SAM: Oh. Yes. I wasn't aware there was a-- yes.
Two bonuses.

733
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,698
MATT: "Oh yeah, there was like four bonuses."

734
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:29,115
SAM: You deserve all of them.

735
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:31,698
MATT: "Damn right."

736
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:40,075
SAM: The other thing that we had talked about, did
that ever come to fruition?

737
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:48,521
MATT: "No, it was unfortunate. You see, my sister
is engaged recently--" And he stands up and walks

738
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:55,863
out of the tavern, putting a coin down on the
front of the bar. "No worries. I'll find you

739
00:50:55,863 --> 00:50:57,784
"another lady." And he walks outside.

740
00:50:57,784 --> 00:51:06,633
SAM: Oh. Oh, we're speaking in code. Okay. Yes, I
need a lady so bad, and you were going to find me

741
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:08,160
a date.

742
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:18,281
MATT: "You're so much better at this when other
people are involved. Why are you so bad when it's me?"

743
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:21,757
(laughter)

744
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:27,079
MATT: He goes outside and guides you into a shaded
portion of a nearby alley and leans against the

745
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,149
wall, waiting for you to follow in.

746
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:34,736
SAM: So. Is she a brunette?

747
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:37,454
MATT: "We're out of the tavern."

748
00:51:37,454 --> 00:51:43,612
SAM: Okay. I don't know how long to keep the cover
going.

749
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:48,714
MATT: "It's fine. Look, it is very difficult to
find anything right now, the way things have been.

750
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:50,903
"But I did manage to scavenge a little bit of
suude."

751
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,003
SAM: Suude?

752
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:57,581
MATT: "Yes." And he pulls out a small brown pouch,
maybe about the size of a d20, really. Like a

753
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:05,465
little nugget there, and it's tied tightly, and he
pockets real fast. "Now, don't ask me again to do this."

754
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:09,121
SAM: Wait, are you a cop? You have to tell me if
you're a cop. Are you a cop?

755
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:10,650
MATT: "No."

756
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,146
SAM: Okay, good.

757
00:52:12,146 --> 00:52:16,582
TALIESIN: That's a myth, for the kids at home, by
the way. Just want to get that out there. Sorry.

758
00:52:16,582 --> 00:52:19,888
Can't fill their heads with bad ideas. Carry on.

759
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:23,727
WILL: Kids arrested all over town tonight.

760
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:27,356
TALIESIN: Are you a cop? No?

761
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:36,445
SAM: All right. How much do I owe you for this?

762
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:41,958
MATT: "No, don't worry about it. Simply the bonus.
Whatever you feel you owe me for it. But not

763
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,496
"again, please. It's harrowing."

764
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,330
LIAM: Heroin?

765
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,365
MATT: "Harrowing. It was harrowing to acquire this
for you."

766
00:52:51,365 --> 00:53:02,094
SAM: Jarett, thank you for this. Thank you very
much. And I'm cool and all, but do you put it up

767
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:10,436
your butt, or snort it, or do you burn it somehow,
or wrap it in something, or eat it? I'm pretty

768
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:11,775
cool, but--

769
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:14,463
(laughter)

770
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:15,928
OFF-SCREEN: Ha!

771
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:20,411
(laughter)

772
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:28,490
MATT: He leans in really close, one eye
half-squinted, going, "I will never understand

773
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:34,215
"you, Scanlan Shorthalt. You're a smart boy. How do
you think you use it?"

774
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:37,054
SAM: In a pipe of some sort?

775
00:53:37,054 --> 00:53:46,125
MATT: "Sure." And he walks out of the alleyway,
really embarrassed that he even did this. The

776
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:52,983
minute you said that, he was like, oh no, I just
bought beer for a 12-year-old. He's like, ooh.

777
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:57,782
TALIESIN: I'd like to think that "ha!" was passing
that guy coming out of the pub, and getting a

778
00:53:57,782 --> 00:53:58,975
second--

779
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:11,465
SAM: All right, when you get her number, call me
or whatever, so we'll meet her later.

780
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:20,197
MATT: He walks away and puts his hand up with a--
and keeps walking. You can almost see the hanging

781
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:24,051
head shake as he continues back towards where he
was in the tavern.

782
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:25,471
SAM: That went well.

783
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,498
TALIESIN: That went very well.

784
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:27,361
SAM: I got that.

785
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:28,264
TALIESIN: You did that.

786
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,273
SAM: I did it.

787
00:54:29,273 --> 00:54:32,276
MATT: (laughs) Mark down one small pocket satchel
of suude. S-U-U-D-E.

788
00:54:32,276 --> 00:54:34,729
LIAM: That's for after the dragon.

789
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,238
LAURA: It's his own drugs. He's made his own drugs
up.

790
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:39,901
TALIESIN: Here you go. Right there.

791
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,186
MARY: He made drugs?

792
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:43,640
LAURA: Well, Matt made drugs.

793
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,068
TALIESIN: Put a glove on if you're going to get
high if you hold it for too long.

794
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:48,594
MATT: There is a society out there. People are
going to continue to find ways to smoke, swallow,

795
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:50,460
or inhale substances.

796
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,832
WILL: Definitely not a cop.

797
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:53,007
MATT: Definitely not.

798
00:54:53,007 --> 00:54:54,284
WILL: Definitely not a cop.

799
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:56,008
MARY: Sometimes you ride the dragon before you
kill it.

800
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,174
WILL: (laughs) Exactly.

801
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:59,092
TALIESIN: Got to ride the dragon before you ride
the dragon.

802
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:00,082
MARISHA: That's right.

803
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,653
MARY: You've got to ride the dragon before you
kill it.

804
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:02,685
WILL: That's right.

805
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,057
MARY: It's going to be great to watch Scanlan take
drugs.

806
00:55:04,057 --> 00:55:05,189
(laughter)

807
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:09,042
MATT: How do you think herbalists of previous
generations found out which plants are poisonous?

808
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,508
Huh? That's bad.

809
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:12,446
(laughter)

810
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:18,654
MATT: It's culture, man. All right, Percy, we need
to make some checks for you.

811
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:21,671
TALIESIN: Actually, do I have to check even if I'm
spending money?

812
00:55:21,671 --> 00:55:23,844
MATT: You're spending money to fix it, but--

813
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:26,833
LAURA: How much money are you spending?

814
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,505
TALIESIN: How much do we have? Sorry, I'll stop.

815
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:29,865
LAURA: You tell me what you need.

816
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:30,891
TALIESIN: We'll find out.

817
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:33,811
MARISHA: You're the prince of Whitestone. Can't
you tap some taxes or something?

818
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:35,188
MATT: You could, actually.

819
00:55:35,188 --> 00:55:40,214
TALIESIN: I really try not to do that. That's a
dick move. People are already iffy on these

820
00:55:40,214 --> 00:55:41,367
things, I imagine.

821
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,502
LIAM: Spend everything right now.

822
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:54,380
TALIESIN: Wow! That made five decisions and landed
on a really good one. That's 28.

823
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,286
MATT: Okay, yeah. This is for Bad News?

824
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:02,683
TALIESIN: Yeah, Bad News is the only one that is
broken. The rest survived.

825
00:56:02,683 --> 00:56:08,398
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. For Bad News, the
original cost I have here... sorry, have to pull

826
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,917
up the PDF to remind me, so I get it right.

827
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:13,653
LIAM: Two electrum.

828
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:23,693
MATT: (laughs) I'd put it about at maybe 500 gold
worth of materials.

829
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:26,412
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay. Feel better about that.

830
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:29,628
MATT: It's not a magical implement, 
but it is expensive.

831
00:56:29,628 --> 00:56:38,055
TALIESIN: It is. It's got a lot of moving parts.
And then I'm going to go and talk to Cassandra,

832
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:39,586
quickly.

833
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:46,162
MATT: All right. As you make your way to try and
find Cassandra, she is actually currently in her

834
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:54,535
room talking with Allura. Talking with Gilmore,
with Brom and Drake. There's guards rushing in and

835
00:56:54,535 --> 00:56:58,857
out. There's a general sense of ramping energy, as
everyone is gathering everything they have at

836
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:01,616
their disposal in preparation for what's going to
happen tomorrow.

837
00:57:01,616 --> 00:57:03,289
MARY: Where's Raishan?

838
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:06,765
MATT: (laughs) You can go look for Raishan, if you
like.

839
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,156
MARY: No, I just wanted to know.

840
00:57:08,156 --> 00:57:14,714
MATT: You don't know where Raishan is right now.
As you enter the room, over in the corner,

841
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:18,388
mid-conversation, Cassandra is currently rolling
up some papers and handing them to a guard. Turns

842
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:21,800
and finishes a quick bit of conversation
whispering off to the side with Drake. Turns

843
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,155
around and her eyes meet you and she goes,
"Brother."

844
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:25,362
TALIESIN: My lady.

845
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:28,519
MATT: "Yes. What can I do to help you?"

846
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:32,731
TALIESIN: We're preparing to leave. We are
preparing to have a small strike force go

847
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:38,667
underneath the city and do what we can while the other
armies hopefully distract, thin the forces and

848
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:42,405
give us a shot at taking care of this once and
for all.

849
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:43,882
MATT: "Right."

850
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:49,485
TALIESIN: Is there anything left in the vaults,
potion-wise? Especially healing potions. We don't

851
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:52,272
want to drain you, obviously, but I thought I
would make one last push.

852
00:57:52,272 --> 00:58:06,610
MATT: "We've provided what we can. Drake, and a few
of our helpful supporters here in the city have

853
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:12,221
"been providing for this purpose. It's not much,
but we do have--" and she snaps her fingers and

854
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,884
points to Drake.

855
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:19,973
You see he's currently putting together a big
leather package. "Oh! No worry." And he lifts it up on

856
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:25,058
the table. You hear the clanking of glass around
on the inside of the satchel. He pulls it down a

857
00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:30,001
little bit over the front, pushes to the side and
you can see there are two cushioned racks that

858
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:39,681
contain various sizes of vials. "All right, we've
got three greater healing potions, one basic

859
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:44,932
"healing potion. That's as much as we can find, to
be honest right now. There hasn't been a lot of

860
00:58:44,932 --> 00:58:50,044
"trade, and our supply's been limited, and most of
what we had has been used by you or folks here in

861
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:51,487
"defense of the city."

862
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:52,597
LAURA: You said one basic?

863
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:58,034
MATT: "One basic. Yeah, regular healing potion.
However, I've spent my time, knowing what's

864
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:04,278
"coming, and being a focuser of the elemental arts,
brewing a few helpful bits here. I wish I had more

865
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:08,371
"time, but our timeline has been a bit
accelerated."

866
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:16,341
He pulls out the second cushioned grouping
here. The vials are different shapes. It seems

867
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:21,135
like the glass has been scavenged from what was
available, but the coloration is similar, and you

868
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:25,584
recognize these. You've had these before. These
are four potions of fire resistance.

869
00:59:25,584 --> 00:59:28,234
SAM: That's huge.

870
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,375
LAURA: That's great.

871
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,409
MARISHA: That's massive.

872
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:35,912
TALIESIN: We will be grateful for you till the end
of our days.

873
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:37,797
MATT: "Oh, I count on it."

874
00:59:37,797 --> 00:59:41,041
TALIESIN: It may only be a day, but you will have
it.

875
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,151
(laughter)

876
00:59:42,151 --> 00:59:47,517
MATT: "Just remembered for these in particular,
they don't last a terribly long time. One hour.

877
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,117
"Make sure you don't drink it too soon."

878
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:54,800
TALIESIN: One hour will be all that is necessary.

879
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:03,504
MATT: "I certainly hope so. So. That's what I am
able to provide for this. I'll be there helping

880
01:00:03,504 --> 01:00:07,273
"with some of the distraction, so we'll figure out
some of the details for the specific attack, but

881
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:12,552
"we're pulling all that we can for this, and we'll
figure out who's going where, who's attacking when

882
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:18,492
"and in what way, I guess, if not tonight,
tomorrow." And he looks over to Cassandra and

883
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:26,477
nods. "I'm going to go pray." He leaves the room.

884
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:29,398
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

885
01:00:29,398 --> 01:00:30,387
MATT: Yes.

886
01:00:30,387 --> 01:00:34,759
LAURA: With potions, do they stack? Can you take
multiple ones and get multiple benefits, or is it

887
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:37,374
like you take one potion and that's the one potion
you get to take?

888
01:00:37,374 --> 01:00:43,567
MATT: I mean, if they're different types of
potions, I'd say they could stack, to a certain

889
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,576
degree. If you just begin to chug four potions
in a row I might be asking for some constitution

890
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:49,283
saving throws.

891
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:52,223
TALIESIN: Or like a mixed drink, that can get
weird, right?

892
01:00:52,223 --> 01:00:53,787
MATT: Yeah. Things might not--

893
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:56,248
MARY: Long island ice tea of death.

894
01:00:56,248 --> 01:01:00,151
MATT: Yeah, exactly. Some effects might not mingle
well or the urge from your body might reject that

895
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:03,486
much ingestion of enchanted fluid.

896
01:01:03,486 --> 01:01:05,240
LAURA: Okay. Cool. Just checking.

897
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,282
MARISHA: Don't mix your darks with your clears--
Pick one.

898
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:12,387
MATT: Don't eat the giant toenail at the bottom
of the bottle.

899
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:18,491
TALIESIN: Water breathing before fire, never been
higher.

900
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:21,682
(laughter)

901
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:24,345
TALIESIN: Exactly. I think that was the-- Yeah.

902
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:26,015
SAM: True.

903
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,257
MATT: Anything else?

904
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:30,461
TALIESIN: I'd like to just grab Cassandra really
quickly and take her aside.

905
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:32,744
MATT: Okay. "Yes, brother?"

906
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:40,783
TALIESIN: I will only take one moment of your
time. I've not had a moment to repay you for my

907
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:55,097
part in all of this yet, and if we survive, I owe
you much. And if I don't, seal off the city. There

908
01:01:55,097 --> 01:02:03,674
is room underneath. Prepare for siege. Prepare to
be a safe haven. Do not be-- do what you can to

909
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:08,271
save the city. Do not get involved in the
aftermath of this if we fail.

910
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:14,079
MATT: "That's actually what I'm discussing with
Allura, and the reason she's staying back is to

911
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:21,985
"help us continue should such an occasion arise.
But I am confident, knowing what you're capable

912
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:30,788
"of, that we worry for naught. We're doing our best
here, and I know you are doing your best there.

913
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:34,625
"Just come back to me."

914
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:41,267
TALIESIN: I will do my best. We've-- for
centuries, you must know we have survived as

915
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:50,561
realists. And it is very hot down there and I do
not like it. Good luck, see you soon.

916
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:54,293
MATT: "I need you. Return."

917
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:57,331
TALIESIN: I shall. And I go pack.

918
01:02:57,331 --> 01:03:06,589
MATT: Okay. As you leave, Vax crosses you in the
doorway, as Gilmore is in mid-conversation. Right

919
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:11,007
now with-- well, it was with Drake and then when
he'd had the conversation, he watched and Drake

920
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:14,654
left and so he was on his way out following
Percival. And you caught him.

921
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:16,776
LIAM: Can I steal you for a second?

922
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:18,101
MATT: "Certainly."

923
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:19,561
LIAM: Over here.

924
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,260
MATT: "All right."

925
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,590
LIAM: Hi, again.

926
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,766
MATT: "Hi."

927
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:27,135
LIAM: Remember how we just saw each other a couple
of days ago, and I tried to say goodbye, and you

928
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:33,382
told me to promise you that I would see you
again?

929
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:39,116
MATT: "Yes. And much to my delight, you've kept
your promise. And you better keep keeping it."

930
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:50,891
LIAM: You know what would help with that? Boy,
have I got an offer for you. You want to help us

931
01:03:50,891 --> 01:04:06,635
save the world? My family and I, we're going to
him. And I wasn't sure the path that would take us

932
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:15,839
there. I thought we might be on our own. But we're
back here. And you are easily the most impressive

933
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:25,337
arcane user I've ever met in my life. And I want
us all to still be breathing in a week. I can't

934
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:30,537
think of anyone better to stand with us than you,
Shaun.

935
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:35,539
MATT: His eyes look off for a minute. And he
reaches up and rubs the back of his neck, and you

936
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:46,001
can see there's still a scar there. He goes, "If
I'm to be honest, I've felt a bit useless here in

937
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:57,737
"Whitestone for quite some time. I was there when
this all began. It destroyed not just the thing

938
01:04:57,737 --> 01:05:11,831
"I've been working to build for so long of my life,
but friends, home, for all of us. So it is my just

939
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:20,949
"honor, and vengeful glee, to join you on the siege
to Emon, if you will have me?"

940
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:28,577
LIAM: I grasp him by the back of the head.
Gesundheit. I'm so glad to have you with us,

941
01:05:28,577 --> 01:05:31,569
friend. So glad.

942
01:05:31,569 --> 01:05:35,523
MATT: "Just stay alive. Keep that promise."

943
01:05:35,523 --> 01:05:37,848
LIAM: It will be a little bit easier now.

944
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:40,388
MATT: "Good." And he smacks you on the cheek.

945
01:05:40,388 --> 01:05:42,842
LIAM: Good time for a musical quote.

946
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:47,797
ALL: (singing) Stay alive.

947
01:05:47,797 --> 01:05:54,282
MATT: He smacks you on the cheek and goes,
"Learned that from you. All right then, I guess

948
01:05:54,282 --> 01:06:04,176
"I've got to gather my supplies and-- Oh, it's been
a while since I've seen some-- I've never

949
01:06:04,176 --> 01:06:08,344
"actually seen combat on this scale before when,
you know, I wasn't just trying to run away? So

950
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:11,848
"let's see if I can knock off the old dust."

951
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,602
LIAM: I'm sure it will be glorious.

952
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,644
MATT: "Oh, I can guarantee it."

953
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:19,574
MARISHA: Plug.

954
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:21,759
MATT: "All right."

955
01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:23,591
LIAM: Let's do it.

956
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:27,309
LAURA: I'm wondering if we should eat a Heroes'
Feast tonight, and then just eat one again

957
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:31,960
tomorrow? 'Cause we just don't know what's going
to happen during the day anymore. Just a Heroes'

958
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,088
Feast every night. Be ready, and just, you know.

959
01:06:35,088 --> 01:06:38,162
SAM: Yep. Do we have the money for that?

960
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,573
LAURA: It's, yeah. We're fine.

961
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:43,350
SAM: All right.

962
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,058
TALIESIN: I was looking forward to a Heroes'
Brunch, personally.

963
01:06:46,058 --> 01:06:48,038
LAURA: Either one.

964
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:50,007
SAM: Bagels and lox?

965
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,847
MATT: Heroes' High Tea.

966
01:06:51,847 --> 01:06:54,010
MARY: Eggs Benedict with lots of extra
hollandaise.

967
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,637
TALIESIN: Capers of might.

968
01:06:57,637 --> 01:07:01,805
MATT: What else do you guys wish to prepare, if
anything?

969
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:03,363
LIAM: Holy shit, man!

970
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:05,913
LAURA: We have our potions. Should we split them
up?

971
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:09,961
SAM: Who needs fire giant, I mean fire resistance,
the most?

972
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:13,894
LAURA: Okay. We have five potions of fire
resistance.

973
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:14,756
SAM: We do?

974
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,804
LAURA: Yes, because we already had one. Now, we
have two superior, five regular healing, and three

975
01:07:18,804 --> 01:07:25,749
greater. What we also have is a potion of
invulnerability, which is clutch, and a potion of

976
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:33,529
speed. We need to decide who to give the potion of
invulnerability to, because it lasts for ten

977
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:34,401
minutes?

978
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:39,308
MATT: No, one minute. I'm pretty sure, I'll check,
but that's a powerful-ass potion.

979
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:41,348
LAURA: You can't die, right, when you take it?

980
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,803
MATT: You wish!

981
01:07:42,803 --> 01:07:46,156
LAURA: I mean, can you take damage when you've got
it going? It's like a minute of no damage?

982
01:07:46,156 --> 01:07:53,210
MATT: You take damage, you have resistance to all
damage, so all damage you take is halved.

983
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,690
MARY: Should that be decided mid-battle? Clutch.

984
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,292
SAM: That one seems like a specific task.

985
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:02,014
LAURA: That's a specific task kind of thing. So
we'll decide that later?

986
01:08:02,014 --> 01:08:08,291
TALIESIN: There is an item. And I'm currently
holding it, and I don't know if I'm the best

987
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:14,208
person to be holding this. But I'm just going to
pass this down the line to see if anyone has an

988
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,703
opinion.

989
01:08:15,703 --> 01:08:17,402
MARISHA: It's the sword.

990
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:19,772
LIAM: This is too bad, I can't wield this fucker.

991
01:08:19,772 --> 01:08:21,531
LAURA: I can't wield a sword either.

992
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,973
TALIESIN: It's a dex-based sword, correct?

993
01:08:23,973 --> 01:08:26,142
MATT: The Sword of Dragon-Slaying?

994
01:08:26,142 --> 01:08:28,074
TALIESIN: Yeah. Or it can switch.

995
01:08:28,074 --> 01:08:30,513
MATT: I'm allowing it to switch if need be.

996
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:39,164
TALIESIN: So it can be strength- or dex-based.
Maybe this is the thing to hand to Grog. And one

997
01:08:39,164 --> 01:08:45,929
minute of invulnerability with that is possibly
the cruellest thing that dragon will have ever

998
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:47,716
experienced.

999
01:08:47,716 --> 01:08:52,770
LAURA: The thing is, if he's raging, I don't know
if he'll think to switch over.

1000
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,109
TALIESIN: Well, it's an attuned weapon.

1001
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:57,350
MATT: He isn't resistant to fire while he's
raging.

1002
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:02,602
MARISHA: No, but he has resistance to physical
damage, and if he takes a potion of fire

1003
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:09,202
resistance, is he pretty much covered the same way
if he's raging and has a fire potion?

1004
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:10,812
MATT: Possibly.

1005
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:15,364
LIAM: I could use this because it's dex-based, if
I so choose?

1006
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:18,396
LAURA: But you can't do three attacks with it,
because it's bigger?

1007
01:09:18,396 --> 01:09:21,908
MATT: Well, yeah. You would have one attack with
that.

1008
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,951
LIAM: One attack, but not-- I can't do longsword
and then a dagger?

1009
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:26,547
MATT: You could do longsword and then a bonus.

1010
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:28,306
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

1011
01:09:28,306 --> 01:09:30,434
MATT: Let me check, I don't know if he can do them
all.

1012
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:36,360
LAURA: Could he do Whisper and then attack with
the dragon sword?

1013
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:40,789
TALIESIN: I don't know how many items you have
attuned at the moment?

1014
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:42,640
WILL: Just two, I believe.

1015
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,256
TALIESIN: So you could go for a triple?

1016
01:09:44,256 --> 01:09:56,437
WILL: I could. Well, I have my shadow spear. But
my nec, so you'd want the nec damage from that, is

1017
01:09:56,437 --> 01:09:59,579
what you'd be looking for. I don't know if I could
wield the two of them together?

1018
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:02,731
TALIESIN: It's a one-handed sword, so I'm not
sure. What is your--

1019
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,861
MATT: It has to be a light melee weapon in both
hands, it looks to do this, unless you have a feat

1020
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:08,295
to fix that.

1021
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:09,777
TALIESIN: Which I do.

1022
01:10:09,777 --> 01:10:13,641
MATT: You have the-- Do you have Dual Wielder as a
feat?

1023
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:14,629
LIAM: Yes.

1024
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:17,415
MATT: Yeah, so yes, you can use the longsword and
Whisper in the other hand.

1025
01:10:17,415 --> 01:10:18,823
LIAM: But it's attunement, so I have to choose
something.

1026
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,209
MATT: You'd have to chose that over--

1027
01:10:20,209 --> 01:10:22,782
LIAM: This would supersede Whisper. Yeah.

1028
01:10:22,782 --> 01:10:26,012
LAURA: What? Whisper is a Vestige.

1029
01:10:26,012 --> 01:10:34,137
LIAM: I understand that, but this is very strong,
and with wings I could go anywhere.

1030
01:10:34,137 --> 01:10:44,248
MATT: Do note. As part of the rogue ability-- I'm
just double-checking here, but I'm pretty sure--

1031
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:54,415
The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
Technically I'm allowing-- Actually, no, I'm

1032
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,787
allowing it to be a finesse.

1033
01:10:56,787 --> 01:10:58,342
LIAM: You're allowing it? You're allowing it?

1034
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:03,193
MATT: Well, because it's strength or dex. I'm
sticking to my choice.

1035
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:04,653
LIAM: Okay. So it's light.

1036
01:11:04,653 --> 01:11:07,947
MATT: It's not light. It's finesse. Meaning you
can choose strength or dexterity.

1037
01:11:07,947 --> 01:11:12,581
MARY: I have a question. Last time I saw you, you
were looking for the Vestiges.

1038
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:13,687
LAURA: Yes.

1039
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:14,832
MARY: Did you find them?

1040
01:11:14,832 --> 01:11:18,325
LAURA: All of them! <i>All</i> of them! Well, all of
them that we know about.

1041
01:11:18,325 --> 01:11:20,803
MARY: Do you know what to do with them?

1042
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:25,923
SAM: They are all super powerful, and are awesome,
and you'll see them in battle tomorrow.

1043
01:11:25,923 --> 01:11:29,136
LAURA: That's all we know, is that you fight with
them. That's all we know. Why, do you know more?

1044
01:11:29,136 --> 01:11:38,204
MARY: Is there any information we can glean from
Osysa at all, in Vasselheim, of how to use them?

1045
01:11:38,204 --> 01:11:41,236
LAURA: Well, it would mean traveling to
Vasselheim.

1046
01:11:41,236 --> 01:11:46,596
MARY: That's true. Is there any way to get there,
just quick and bamf in and just--

1047
01:11:46,596 --> 01:11:48,805
TALIESIN: Last time we went somewhere quick and
bamfed in--

1048
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,199
MARY: It was a long time?

1049
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:54,151
TALIESIN: Things went poorly. But we could speak
to her. We could talk to her.

1050
01:11:54,151 --> 01:12:01,681
LAURA: One of us could go and bamf back. And
be back tomorrow morning.

1051
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,779
WILL: Well, you said you used them.

1052
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,460
MARISHA: Yeah, we've been using them

1053
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,866
WILL: So then you know what they do, for the most
part, right?

1054
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:09,057
ALL: Yeah.

1055
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:10,304
WILL: Why waste a trip?

1056
01:12:10,304 --> 01:12:13,289
MARY: What if there's a way to combine them?

1057
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:16,104
MARISHA: We tried. We put them all in a pile...

1058
01:12:16,104 --> 01:12:18,060
(laughter)

1059
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,873
WILL: That didn't work? Piling them on top of each
other didn't work?

1060
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:21,164
SAM: They didn't become a robot.

1061
01:12:21,164 --> 01:12:23,005
LAURA: Not as much as we hoped it would, no.

1062
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:26,721
MARISHA: Yeah. There are other Vestiges, too, that
are out there.

1063
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,705
LIAM: You have a potion of haste, yeah?

1064
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:30,035
LAURA: Yeah, potion of speed.

1065
01:12:30,035 --> 01:12:33,077
LIAM: What if you gave me that and I gave you my
boots?

1066
01:12:33,077 --> 01:12:35,021
SAM: Real quick, who needs the fire protection?

1067
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:36,734
MARY: I don't; I'm resistant.

1068
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:40,656
MARISHA: If we have plenty of potions, I'll take
it so I don't have to use a concentration spell.

1069
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:46,591
TALIESIN: Ditto. My plan is to stay away from the
fire, but if I can't, that would certainly help.

1070
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,281
WILL: My plate is partially fire resistant.

1071
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:52,926
SAM: Vex? You don't need it.

1072
01:12:52,926 --> 01:12:54,188
LAURA: Fire resistance?

1073
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:56,591
SAM: Didn't I give you that? Oh, I gave you cold
resistance.

1074
01:12:56,591 --> 01:12:58,266
LAURA: Yeah. I need fire resistance.

1075
01:12:58,266 --> 01:12:59,839
SAM: What did you give me?

1076
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:01,371
MARY: Chlamydia.

1077
01:13:01,371 --> 01:13:03,131
SAM: Acid resistance.

1078
01:13:03,131 --> 01:13:04,835
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1079
01:13:04,835 --> 01:13:12,108
MARY: Sorry. I was just in Australia. I got it
from a koala. I'm kidding.

1080
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:17,722
LAURA: I could take off my bracers--

1081
01:13:17,722 --> 01:13:20,006
LIAM: It's up to you. I don't want to--

1082
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:21,885
MARISHA: There's also the discussion--

1083
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:24,468
SAM: What. More discussions?

1084
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:30,135
LIAM: You take the boots, I'm on the potion. I
have Whisper and this sword.

1085
01:13:30,135 --> 01:13:35,296
MARISHA: Are we going to try and lure Thordak out
of his lair as a challenger?

1086
01:13:35,296 --> 01:13:37,237
SAM: No, we're going to sneak into his lair,
right?

1087
01:13:37,237 --> 01:13:39,206
WILL: You're going to corner it.

1088
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:42,562
TALIESIN: He's not going to leave his lair
anymore; he knows we're coming

1089
01:13:42,562 --> 01:13:45,677
MARY: So, just very briefly, what is the plan?

1090
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:53,298
SAM: The plan, as I understated it, is: we send a
vicious army to attack at the gates, all over the

1091
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:59,971
place, drawing out Thordak's forces in an epic
battle. Blood, sinew, and gore everywhere, while

1092
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:07,158
we slip under the city, unbeknownst to Thordak, in
the tunnels with the Clasp leading us. Leading us

1093
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:11,891
right to the center of town where we pop up, and
surprise Thordak! He didn't know we were coming!

1094
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:15,756
He thought that there was an army at the gates!
And we stab him real quick and leave.

1095
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:19,719
LAURA: Done. And we also find whatever it is he's
protecting and kill that too.

1096
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:22,207
SAM: And at some point Raishan comes and helps
us.

1097
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:25,396
LAURA: Hey! What's up?

1098
01:14:25,396 --> 01:14:26,612
WILL: How you doing?

1099
01:14:26,612 --> 01:14:28,170
LAURA: I'm really sorry. About all of that.

1100
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,867
WILL: No, it's no problem. It's great.

1101
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:34,208
MARY: I have a question. Do I know about the
machine? Have I been told about that? Did Raishan

1102
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,592
tell me about that?

1103
01:14:35,592 --> 01:14:36,766
MATT: Which one?

1104
01:14:36,766 --> 01:14:39,067
MARY: The machine that Thordak is building, or
whatever the heck he's--

1105
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:45,662
MATT: Thordak, as far as you know, has let nobody
down there, Raishan included. And you have no idea

1106
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:47,858
what machinations Thordak is--

1107
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,314
MARY: But I do know about it.

1108
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:53,474
MATT: I mean, you know as much as they do. It's
come up in conversation previously, yes.

1109
01:14:53,474 --> 01:14:57,269
WILL: And you said we're going into the tunnels?
Does anyone know the way through the tunnels?

1110
01:14:57,269 --> 01:15:03,557
SAM: The Clasp does. They're an order of rogues
and thieves who hate us. But they're going to help us.

1111
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:05,136
MARY: Do you trust them?

1112
01:15:05,136 --> 01:15:09,866
SAM: We totally trust them because they are
scoundrels and liars. And we have no other choice.

1113
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:11,972
TALIESIN: It doesn't serve them to lie to us.

1114
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:13,579
MARY: This sounds like a wonderful plan!

1115
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:16,768
WILL: It doesn't serve the scoundrels and liars to
lie and be scoundrels?

1116
01:15:16,768 --> 01:15:20,289
TALIESIN: It doesn't serve them in this moment,
no. You know, if you're always a liar and a

1117
01:15:20,289 --> 01:15:23,329
scoundrel, then no one will ever trust you to do
anything, they're only conveniently liars and

1118
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:24,746
scoundrels.

1119
01:15:24,746 --> 01:15:27,121
WILL: I love this plan, this is great.

1120
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:28,990
SAM: (laughs) It's pretty air-tight.

1121
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:35,530
WILL: Yeah. I don't see any room for problems. So
you want to go in and corner the dragon where he

1122
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,675
lives and is most powerful--

1123
01:15:37,675 --> 01:15:38,960
SAM: Yes, yes!

1124
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,710
WILL: His back to the wall, and no escape--

1125
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,925
SAM: He can escape at any moment, he can fly.

1126
01:15:42,925 --> 01:15:46,095
WILL: Just us, though? Not the entire army which
we are using as a diversion?

1127
01:15:46,095 --> 01:15:47,562
SAM: Just a partial group. Yes!

1128
01:15:47,562 --> 01:15:49,594
WILL: But the scoundrels are going to lead us to
him?

1129
01:15:49,594 --> 01:15:51,302
TALIESIN: Well, he has his own army.

1130
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:52,631
WILL: Of course.

1131
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:57,986
TALIESIN: So we need to keep his army distracted
so we're not fighting a dragon and an army. So

1132
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:03,413
those armies will hopefully either distract the
armies or; if he chooses not to send the armies to

1133
01:16:03,413 --> 01:16:07,683
fight the rest of the armies that we've brought,
all of our armies also converge on the dragon's

1134
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:09,261
nest and then we have everybody there.

1135
01:16:09,261 --> 01:16:13,465
WILL: You're engaging all of your forces in one
play? If he holds his forces back, why not send in

1136
01:16:13,465 --> 01:16:15,362
skirmishes to see what happens first?

1137
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,785
LAURA: Oh, I like this plan. He's good.

1138
01:16:17,785 --> 01:16:21,226
TALIESIN: No, we have people that we can do for
that. Although, it's not just one army we have. We

1139
01:16:21,226 --> 01:16:22,830
have groups of them, technically. I was just--

1140
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:26,217
WILL: Attacking in one place?

1141
01:16:26,217 --> 01:16:28,100
TALIESIN: Oh, no. All around the city.

1142
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,942
WILL: Is there a weak point?

1143
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:31,925
SAM: Our plan.

1144
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:39,338
(laughter)

1145
01:16:39,338 --> 01:16:49,406
TALIESIN: Don't you laugh! No! No! You don't get
to laugh. That scares us. Sadly, the only weak

1146
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:50,470
point is--

1147
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:57,009
LIAM: We either go with the shitty hand we've been
given, or we lie down and let him steamroll over us.

1148
01:16:57,009 --> 01:17:01,593
MARISHA: Yes, but we can also try and formulate at
least a vague plan, so that we all don't die

1149
01:17:01,593 --> 01:17:02,929
within a single--

1150
01:17:02,932 --> 01:17:05,022
TALIESIN: I think this is a vague plan so that we
don't all die.

1151
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:07,607
MARISHA: All right, okay. Let's build off of what
Kash has.

1152
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:09,889
TALIESIN: If it's too specific, then it's going to
go wrong too quickly--

1153
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:11,652
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. He's right.

1154
01:17:11,652 --> 01:17:13,694
MARY: Plus we don't know what to expect. We have
to be ready for anything.

1155
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:17,537
WILL: We feint the city. Send skirmishes in to
feint the city so they don't know where the main

1156
01:17:17,537 --> 01:17:22,568
attack is coming from. They'll have to defend
every wall. What you then do-- what you want them

1157
01:17:22,568 --> 01:17:25,735
doing, because they're defending the wall, they
won't know when the serious attack is coming from.

1158
01:17:25,735 --> 01:17:29,884
Then you send them towards one fortified position.
That would draw everybody to the one fortified

1159
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:34,318
position, but that's also a feint. And you come in
the backdoor. That's always the way you do it.

1160
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:39,518
Meanwhile, we'll take the scoundrels and liars.
And hopefully they're going to take us to corner

1161
01:17:39,518 --> 01:17:43,128
the giant thing that wants to kill all of us, in
the place where he is the most powerful.

1162
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:44,508
LAURA: Yeah, that one!

1163
01:17:44,508 --> 01:17:46,124
TALIESIN: I'm actually very okay with this plan.

1164
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,458
SAM: We should have him with us always!

1165
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,999
(laughter)

1166
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,319
MARY: I totally agree.

1167
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:54,198
LAURA: Do it! Let's do that, let's do that!

1168
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:58,033
WILL: Let's do that! Okay! Great plan! Oh my god!
Who's in charge? Who's leading your ground forces?

1169
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:05,016
SAM: We have no leader. Except we do have a secret
weapon: we have a dragon who definitely wants

1170
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:08,739
something that we don't know about. Who might or
might not be working with us.

1171
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:11,022
LAURA: We also have another secret weapon!

1172
01:18:11,022 --> 01:18:12,468
MARISHA: We have two dragons.

1173
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,283
SAM: We have a sword that is a dragon-slaying
sword.

1174
01:18:14,283 --> 01:18:17,069
LIAM and MARISHA: A whole other dragon.

1175
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:23,412
WILL: We should just kill each other now and just
save the trouble. We got to plan something!

1176
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:25,307
LAURA: Scanlan, you do remember the flute, right?

1177
01:18:25,307 --> 01:18:28,218
SAM: Yeah, I carry it with me always. I use it all
the time.

1178
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:33,181
LAURA: I wonder how long it'll take? To bamf
over when we play the flute? Is it instantaneous

1179
01:18:33,181 --> 01:18:36,918
or is it like, it takes a day?

1180
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:38,400
SAM: We'll never know.

1181
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,559
LAURA: We'll find out.

1182
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:40,719
(laughter)

1183
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,238
SAM: I'll be dead long before it works.

1184
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:44,164
TALIESIN: Six months later, "Where is everybody?"

1185
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:45,739
(laughter)

1186
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:48,565
MARISHA: I told you we were going to die if we
didn't have you.

1187
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:52,049
WILL: No, you're going to die even with me! But
I'm going to be the guy going, "Hey, we could have

1188
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:53,394
"planned this better!"

1189
01:18:53,394 --> 01:18:54,964
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

1190
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,504
MARY: I think you've given them a really good
plan.

1191
01:18:56,504 --> 01:18:58,031
LAURA: Yeah, no, that's great! Let's do that!

1192
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:03,767
TALIESIN: There is no situation that anyone is
going to come up with where we're looking good,

1193
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:07,497
and this is going to work well. There's just--
there's a dragon in the middle of the city with an

1194
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:12,436
evil army and we have to deal with it, and there's
just no positive way to deal with that.

1195
01:19:12,436 --> 01:19:15,100
MARY: Are we taking Raishan with us?

1196
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,596
SAM: Raishan, I feel like she's going to meet us
there.

1197
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:23,970
MARISHA: It just seems so highly defeatist to
already plan for-- you know, defeat.

1198
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:28,228
TALIESIN: It's not planning for defeat. It's
recognizing that no matter what, ten minutes into

1199
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:30,928
it, everything that we thought we knew is
going to be wrong anyway.

1200
01:19:30,928 --> 01:19:35,113
WILL: At least tell me you're not going to send
all your forces in at the same time. You're

1201
01:19:35,113 --> 01:19:36,205
saving a reserve.

1202
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:37,403
LAURA: Of course.

1203
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:40,570
MARISHA: Okay. Then we need to talk about the
forces that are going in. More armies are talented

1204
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:41,655
than others.

1205
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:43,616
SAM: We're not sending them all in?

1206
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:45,508
TALIESIN: No, we're not. We are going to surround
the city.

1207
01:19:45,508 --> 01:19:49,258
WILL: I need one supreme general who's going to be
in charge of everything. Who stays back as we're

1208
01:19:49,258 --> 01:19:50,462
attacking.

1209
01:19:50,462 --> 01:19:52,784
LAURA: Daxio is going to do that.

1210
01:19:52,784 --> 01:19:53,969
MARY: All right.

1211
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:55,299
WILL: And the men trust him?

1212
01:19:55,299 --> 01:19:57,117
LAURA: Yes. He's the leader of the army.

1213
01:19:57,117 --> 01:19:58,541
WILL: Okay.

1214
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:00,399
TALIESIN: He's all right.

1215
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:03,320
MARISHA: Then we need to get this plan to him.

1216
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,002
LAURA: Yeah, we need to talk to him.

1217
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:07,888
TALIESIN: We have communications.

1218
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:13,434
MARISHA: So we're going to have waves of assault
from one position, have other people flank in from

1219
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:14,498
another position--

1220
01:20:14,498 --> 01:20:15,917
WILL: And you're attacking a fortified city?

1221
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:21,651
TALIESIN: Fortified-ish. Well, the hope is
actually-- also we have the 50 men from Fort

1222
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:24,177
Daxio. We can bring them in underground as well,
and just have them pop up--

1223
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:25,565
LAURA: And open the gates?

1224
01:20:25,565 --> 01:20:28,115
TALIESIN: --all sorts of places. Also open the
gates.

1225
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,721
WILL: So you could bring forces with us to come up
in the middle of the city?

1226
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:31,952
LAURA: Yeah.

1227
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,816
WILL: That's good. We should have talked about
that in the beginning.

1228
01:20:33,816 --> 01:20:37,616
SAM: I also think there's a SWAT team that's
available to us.

1229
01:20:37,616 --> 01:20:38,811
TALIESIN: He thinks there's a SWAT team.

1230
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:42,531
WILL: You should-- you should talk less.

1231
01:20:42,531 --> 01:20:43,756
SAM: Smile more?

1232
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:46,319
(laughter)

1233
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:48,091
TALIESIN: I think you smile just the right amount.

1234
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:59,174
MARY: I use my Awakened Mind to speak to Kash
telepathically. You can't respond out loud, so

1235
01:20:59,174 --> 01:21:09,367
don't. You know how I feel about Raishan. You know
what I've experienced with her. Keep an eye on

1236
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:17,761
her. Don't trust her. If you see anything while
we're out there, you let me know and we'll take

1237
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:21,241
her out. All right, darling?

1238
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:25,650
SAM: Kash, why are you drooling and staring off
into space?

1239
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,415
(laughter)

1240
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:28,522
WILL: Was-- was I drooling?

1241
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:29,623
SAM: Oh, just a little.

1242
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:31,132
WILL: That's my bad, I'm sorry.

1243
01:21:31,132 --> 01:21:32,986
LAURA: You were talking so much a second ago,
and--

1244
01:21:32,986 --> 01:21:36,759
WILL: I was thinking about how I can't wait to die
tomorrow. Yeah.

1245
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:41,771
SAM: Well, why don't we finalize this plan
tomorrow when we meet with the general who will

1246
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:44,203
be-- what, commanding half the forces?

1247
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,503
MARISHA: I think we need to meet with the general,
like, tonight.

1248
01:21:46,503 --> 01:21:47,704
SAM: Okay. Let's go.

1249
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:48,970
MARISHA: Right now.

1250
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,056
TALIESIN: Meet or telepathically communicate?

1251
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:56,608
LAURA: I think we should send a message through
Allura. She can just scribble a note and send it

1252
01:21:56,608 --> 01:21:57,656
to him.

1253
01:21:57,656 --> 01:22:00,912
TALIESIN: Also that way, he'll have less time,
less effort defying us.

1254
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:06,117
SAM: Why-- why not go talk to him?

1255
01:22:06,117 --> 01:22:11,402
MARISHA: Yeah. I feel like you can't really
scribble an elaborate battle plan in a 25-word

1256
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:12,736
message.

1257
01:22:12,736 --> 01:22:15,677
TALIESIN: It's not written down, it's all
telepathic conversation.

1258
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:22,404
MARISHA: But the Message spell that Allura is
using only allows for very minimal conversation.

1259
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:25,483
It's not exactly-- She can't have a full-blown
conversation with them.

1260
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:27,441
MATT: It's a long-distance Twitter.

1261
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,857
MARISHA: Yeah. A hundred percent.

1262
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:30,500
SAM: Let's go to him.

1263
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:36,207
LAURA: All right, let's go. Right now. I still
think we should eat a Heroes' Feast before we go.

1264
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:37,817
Just in case.

1265
01:22:37,817 --> 01:22:40,587
SAM: When Vex wants to spend money, I'm in
agreement.

1266
01:22:40,587 --> 01:22:42,673
LAURA: What's the difference, really? Just to be
prepared.

1267
01:22:42,673 --> 01:22:44,447
MARISHA: Well, it blows a spell.

1268
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:49,558
LAURA: But the day is almost up. It will protect
us all day tomorrow.

1269
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:51,401
MARISHA: What time is it?

1270
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:56,368
MATT: After this much conversation, it's getting
closer to sunset, probably an hour after--

1271
01:22:56,368 --> 01:22:59,409
SAM: Oi, Pike! Can you do a Heroes Feast for us?

1272
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:00,780
MATT: "Sure!"

1273
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,754
(laughter)

1274
01:23:02,754 --> 01:23:04,011
SAM: Thanks, Pike!

1275
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,680
MATT: "No problem!"

1276
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,009
MARY: You're so tiny, I didn't even see you.

1277
01:23:08,009 --> 01:23:09,907
(laughter)

1278
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:16,688
MATT: Yeah, she then goes ahead and casts Heroes'
Feast. Same cost. Same cost as-- It also cost her

1279
01:23:16,688 --> 01:23:19,162
6th-level spell slot. Which I'll mark.

1280
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:22,925
LAURA: You don't have to, we have party funds for
this, dear.

1281
01:23:22,925 --> 01:23:28,840
MATT: All right. So Heroes' Feast has been
summoned for you guys.

1282
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:34,248
LAURA: Did you just give me 800? I'm just pocketing
your 800, and I'm putting it in the party gold. So

1283
01:23:34,248 --> 01:23:35,578
thank you.

1284
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:37,407
LIAM: It's the same thing.

1285
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:48,251
MATT: So you guys are going to speak to Allura,
then?

1286
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:50,251
SAM: No. We're doing a Heroes' Feast.

1287
01:23:50,251 --> 01:23:52,501
WILL: I was told there was brunch.

1288
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:55,901
MARY: I was promised brunch!

1289
01:23:55,901 --> 01:24:01,586
MARISHA: Do we know exactly where the Syngorn army
is? How far away from--

1290
01:24:01,586 --> 01:24:07,179
MATT: That, you would have to talk to Allura
about. She's acting as the information nexus for

1291
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:12,101
everyone. It takes an hour. You all have to sit
and devour the meal for an hour, for 12 people.

1292
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:13,623
LAURA: Okay.

1293
01:24:13,623 --> 01:24:19,625
MATT: For your party, your two allies there, and
Gilmore, and Jarett, Drake, anybody else you want

1294
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,495
to bring along. And as you guys, for the next 24
hours--

1295
01:24:22,495 --> 01:24:23,712
LAURA: And Trinket.

1296
01:24:23,712 --> 01:24:32,612
SAM: Do you need it?

1297
01:24:32,612 --> 01:24:34,589
LAURA: No.

1298
01:24:34,589 --> 01:24:38,710
WILL: Wait. That was you at the beginning?

1299
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:42,261
(laughter)

1300
01:24:42,261 --> 01:24:44,074
LAURA: Shh-shhh--

1301
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:46,505
MATT: Kima-- you'd have to choose between Kima or
Jarett.

1302
01:24:46,505 --> 01:24:47,958
TALIESIN: Or Kima or Trinket.

1303
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:53,368
LAURA: We have to choose between Kima and Jarett
to come? Or to eat?

1304
01:24:53,368 --> 01:24:56,927
MATT: To eat. You only have up to 12 people for the
meal.

1305
01:24:56,927 --> 01:24:58,548
MARISHA: Kima. She's in the fray.

1306
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:01,403
TALIESIN: Yeah. He can stay back, he has a
crossbow.

1307
01:25:01,403 --> 01:25:07,668
MATT: All righty, so, that being the case, gonna
roll 2d10 to see how much everyone's maximum hit

1308
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:08,795
points increases.

1309
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:10,261
SAM: Oh, we don't need to do Grog.

1310
01:25:10,261 --> 01:25:11,591
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

1311
01:25:11,591 --> 01:25:12,969
SAM: He's not here.

1312
01:25:12,969 --> 01:25:17,914
MATT: That's a really good roll. That's an eight
and a nine. So there you go. All of you gain 17

1313
01:25:17,914 --> 01:25:21,172
additional max hit points for the next 24 hours.

1314
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:23,062
MARISHA: Wow, that's awesome.

1315
01:25:23,062 --> 01:25:26,888
MATT: That's actually really, really good. So keep
a note on that.

1316
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,735
LAURA: And then we're immune to fear and poison,
right?

1317
01:25:29,735 --> 01:25:34,300
MATT: And you're immune to poison and the poisoned
condition.

1318
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,760
SAM: And we have advantage on wisdom saving
throws.

1319
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,028
MATT: All right, I'm marking this here.

1320
01:25:41,028 --> 01:25:51,062
WILL: I feel so much healthier. And the bacon is
great. Fresh lox.

1321
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:53,568
SAM: Zabar's.

1322
01:25:53,568 --> 01:25:55,510
LAURA: I'm so hungry now!

1323
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:59,088
MARY: Hollandaise wasn't that blender stuff, it
was the real thing.

1324
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:04,698
MATT: All right, so you finish your meal. You
summon Allura, she comes and enters the room. She

1325
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:09,982
looks a little frazzled, a little sleepless, but
she's keeping it together. "All right, what do you

1326
01:26:09,982 --> 01:26:11,196
"require?"

1327
01:26:11,196 --> 01:26:15,170
MARISHA: We were curious if you knew the location
of the Syngorn army?

1328
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:22,388
MATT: "Yes, we've been keeping in contact. They
look to be arriving about early afternoon

1329
01:26:22,388 --> 01:26:27,156
"tomorrow, at a far enough distance from Emon.
Their illusionists have been keeping a blanket in

1330
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:34,360
"front of the army to dissuade any visibility and
giving away their position in advance."

1331
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,022
LAURA: Oh, that's so comforting.

1332
01:26:36,022 --> 01:26:37,731
WILL: You have numbers?

1333
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:43,690
MATT: "They are at-- let's see here, they're at
2,000 troops."

1334
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,631
LAURA: Okay. All right.

1335
01:26:46,631 --> 01:26:48,955
MATT: "Give or take, and--"

1336
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:50,975
MARISHA: Do you know the status of the other
armies?

1337
01:26:50,975 --> 01:26:58,112
MATT: "Well, that is the Syngorian force and the
three Daxio-- the Dusk regiment, the Tide

1338
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:04,877
"regiment-- The Dusk, the Gale, and the Tide
regiments with the Syngorian forces."

1339
01:27:04,877 --> 01:27:07,021
LIAM: And all together is 2,000?

1340
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:08,531
MATT: "Yes. A little over 2,000."

1341
01:27:08,531 --> 01:27:09,853
WILL: Are they all foot?

1342
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:16,442
MATT: "They are all foot, yes. Unfortunately, with
the time given, and the transition to and from the

1343
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:23,088
"Feywild, there was an inability to bring with them
most of their beasts of burden and horses. Many of

1344
01:27:23,088 --> 01:27:26,378
"them were left to scatter shortly after the
Conclave's attack."

1345
01:27:26,378 --> 01:27:30,606
SAM: Is there an elite SWAT team task force?

1346
01:27:30,606 --> 01:27:35,302
MATT: "I believe that's-- there is one, and they
are called Vox Machina."

1347
01:27:35,302 --> 01:27:37,928
MARY: I've heard of them.

1348
01:27:37,928 --> 01:27:39,468
WILL: Are there shields?

1349
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:40,881
MATT: "They do have shields."

1350
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,228
WILL: How big?

1351
01:27:42,228 --> 01:27:44,361
MATT: "Uh, depends on the regiments. I mean--"

1352
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:46,278
WILL: Can we form a phalanx, is my question.

1353
01:27:46,278 --> 01:27:47,587
MATT: "I-- Yes, that is--"

1354
01:27:47,587 --> 01:27:51,056
LIAM: He has been training military in
Whitestone.

1355
01:27:51,056 --> 01:27:57,021
MATT: "Specifically the Tide regiment is a
frontline shield phalanx."

1356
01:27:57,021 --> 01:27:58,428
WILL: And how big is it?

1357
01:27:58,428 --> 01:28:03,896
MATT: "I don't actually have numbers on that.
You'd have to talk to Mikael on that. The

1358
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:04,868
"Warmaster."

1359
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:06,812
WILL: And they're going to be attacking a
fortified location?

1360
01:28:06,812 --> 01:28:12,772
MATT: "Yes, the outer walls of Emon are guarded by
a wall. The wall has sustained damage through the

1361
01:28:12,772 --> 01:28:17,134
"Conclave's initial attack and there has not been,
as far as I know, intent to rebuild, or at least a

1362
01:28:17,134 --> 01:28:19,548
"force to be able to since then."

1363
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:25,371
LAURA: So if we could get in, talk to the Clasp,
and have them find a way to open the gates, it

1364
01:28:25,371 --> 01:28:26,717
would help the armies.

1365
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:29,482
WILL: Well, that's the thing, is you'd have to
hold the gate once it's open. That's gonna be the

1366
01:28:29,482 --> 01:28:31,762
hardest part. But 50 men could easily do that.

1367
01:28:31,762 --> 01:28:36,707
LAURA: Plus the Clasp, which hopefully will be
willing to fight.

1368
01:28:36,707 --> 01:28:39,511
SAM: Hey, where's our stone golem?

1369
01:28:39,511 --> 01:28:41,428
TALIESIN: Far away.

1370
01:28:41,428 --> 01:28:42,684
SAM: He's gone.

1371
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,902
WILL: How many-- do we know the numbers that are
inside the city?

1372
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:57,534
MATT: "Not specifically. As far as the lizardfolk
army-- from what we've heard from Asum, from Brom,

1373
01:28:57,534 --> 01:29:04,790
"from Raishan, the estimates are somewhere in the
neighborhood of eight to nine thousand, and at

1374
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:09,637
"least five to six hundred wyverns that are--"

1375
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:12,650
WILL: So we don't control the air?

1376
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:15,702
MATT: "Not on a wide scale, no."

1377
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:17,703
TALIESIN: We have a single battleship.

1378
01:29:17,703 --> 01:29:24,640
WILL: We're attacking a fortified location with no
siege engines, outnumbered three to one.

1379
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:30,308
TALIESIN: Their fortified location also does not
have siege engines, just air force.

1380
01:29:30,308 --> 01:29:37,535
MARISHA: Their air force is also giant wyvern
beasts.

1381
01:29:37,535 --> 01:29:42,579
MATT: "Now, understand, lizardfolk are not the
most hearty, the most well-trained. They're a

1382
01:29:42,579 --> 01:29:47,601
"chaotic force at best and even the bit of
unification they've had under Thordak's banner is

1383
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:56,431
"thin. You've already had luck cutting down a few
of their main sources of tactics; I believe the

1384
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:03,835
"general that you slew outside of Daxio was one of
their main organisers. That's a big blow to their

1385
01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:13,370
"tactic brigade. Who knows who else is in cahoots
with Thordak since he took power, but we've been,

1386
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:20,242
"in previous encounters, chipping away at their
capabilities. Thordak also does have under his

1387
01:30:20,242 --> 01:30:25,562
"command a number of fire giants that he brought
with him from the Fire Plane. However, you also

1388
01:30:25,562 --> 01:30:27,229
"slew their general."

1389
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:29,538
WILL: Are they superstitious?

1390
01:30:29,538 --> 01:30:32,712
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, no."

1391
01:30:32,712 --> 01:30:35,441
WILL: Any type of religion; a devil figure in
their religion?

1392
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:41,542
MATT: "There are. They exist among many various
devils."

1393
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:47,383
WILL: I'm wondering if we have the illusionist
drop the shield when the army gets there and

1394
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:51,140
create an illusion of one of their giant beasts
that they're afraid of on one side of the wall.

1395
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,084
Scatter fear among all of them.

1396
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:57,993
TALIESIN: It could work. The big fear there of
course is that they work for a creature they

1397
01:30:57,993 --> 01:31:00,407
already fear quite a bit.

1398
01:31:00,407 --> 01:31:04,135
LAURA: I think Thordak might be scarier than any
of their gods at this point.

1399
01:31:04,135 --> 01:31:09,008
WILL: Thordak will be busy, hopefully. We want to
move them away from the gate so that the 50 men

1400
01:31:09,008 --> 01:31:11,108
can come up through the city and hold the gate.

1401
01:31:11,108 --> 01:31:14,706
TALIESIN: I think a carrot would be easier than a
stick. I think it would be better to find a force

1402
01:31:14,706 --> 01:31:17,491
for them to rush toward, than to find something
for them rush away from.

1403
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:20,527
MARISHA: Do we know how many spellcasters are in
the Syngorn army?

1404
01:31:20,527 --> 01:31:23,083
MATT: "I do not have those numbers,
unfortunately."

1405
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:24,949
WILL: That could be interesting.

1406
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:26,616
TALIESIN: More carrot, less stick.

1407
01:31:26,616 --> 01:31:30,217
WILL: You might not even need to see the soldiers,
just the dust rising from their boots.

1408
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:34,128
MARY: And the horses charging, if you can make
that kind of illusion.

1409
01:31:34,128 --> 01:31:36,078
MARISHA: We need to figure out how many
spellcasters.

1410
01:31:36,078 --> 01:31:39,710
MATT: "That would be a conversation with the
Warmaster."

1411
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:45,271
MARISHA: They can throw down long-range, large,
covering spells.

1412
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:47,066
SAM: Let's go talk to the Warmaster.

1413
01:31:47,066 --> 01:31:49,581
LAURA: Well we don't know where they'll be exactly
until tomorrow.

1414
01:31:49,581 --> 01:31:53,775
MATT: "Have that conversation at the ready."

1415
01:31:53,775 --> 01:32:03,347
MARISHA: All right, hang on, how about this? We
know that they're to arrive in Emon by the

1416
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:10,533
afternoon. We can just try to connect with them in
the early morning and march in with them, then

1417
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:12,703
split when we get closer to the gates.

1418
01:32:12,703 --> 01:32:14,669
TALIESIN: And then meet the 50 men at Greyskull
Keep.

1419
01:32:14,669 --> 01:32:17,319
WILL: Do we have access to anything that goes
boom?

1420
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:23,151
TALIESIN: A little bit. Do I have anything
possibly still leftover at Greyskull, any of my

1421
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:24,445
supplies?

1422
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:31,150
MATT: You do have a small cache of blackpowder at
your disposal. It's about a cask.

1423
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:34,951
TALIESIN: I make it myself, half the time.

1424
01:32:34,951 --> 01:32:37,465
WILL: A cask in the right place against an already
damaged wall could punch a hole.

1425
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:38,823
TALIESIN: It could.

1426
01:32:38,823 --> 01:32:44,193
WILL: And if we're underneath, and the foundation
is already weakened, we'd be trapped but the army

1427
01:32:44,193 --> 01:32:45,531
could get inside.

1428
01:32:45,531 --> 01:32:47,589
TALIESIN: Do you still have that siege arrow or is
that gone now?

1429
01:32:47,589 --> 01:32:55,396
LAURA: I do, I have a siege arrow. And Grog does
extra damage against buildings and walls.

1430
01:32:55,396 --> 01:33:00,812
MATT: "Yes I do!" (boom) slams his fists together,
and as they hit you hear what sounds like a very

1431
01:33:00,812 --> 01:33:05,631
localized sound of a rockslide. Just like (boom).

1432
01:33:05,631 --> 01:33:07,234
MARISHA: Rad.

1433
01:33:07,234 --> 01:33:14,127
TALIESIN: So we do have a siege arrow which will
basically do the damage of-- It's a

1434
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:19,843
wall-shatterer. It's designed to bring down
stone.

1435
01:33:19,843 --> 01:33:24,066
LAURA: So it damages stone, specifically? The
siege arrow?

1436
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:32,863
MATT: Yes. It damages anything that is liable to
siege.

1437
01:33:33,009 --> 01:33:35,143
WILL: And it can be fired by anybody?

1438
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:39,646
TALIESIN: Yes, but it is weirdly weighted and
she's probably the one you want firing it.

1439
01:33:39,646 --> 01:33:41,516
LAURA: I'm a really good archer.

1440
01:33:41,516 --> 01:33:44,066
WILL: I remember, when I brought you back from the
dead.

1441
01:33:44,066 --> 01:33:45,660
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god thank you so much.

1442
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,023
WILL: You're welcome, not a problem.

1443
01:33:47,023 --> 01:33:52,621
MARY: What am I, chopped liver? I get nothing? I
think it was both of us, I believe.

1444
01:33:52,621 --> 01:33:54,433
WILL: That could be interesting, though.

1445
01:33:54,433 --> 01:33:56,562
TALIESIN: Yes it could. I'd forgotten about that.

1446
01:33:56,562 --> 01:34:00,349
WILL: Well because what they'll be expecting is
for 50 men to come in and hold the gate. What if

1447
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:06,169
holding the gate is actually a distraction? And
then we punch a hole through the wall and go in

1448
01:34:06,169 --> 01:34:07,241
the back door.

1449
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:08,492
LAURA: Yes. I like it.

1450
01:34:08,492 --> 01:34:13,650
WILL: But we're going to be in the tunnel, we're
working about the top right now.

1451
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:18,809
MARY: But if we can scatter their forces front and
back, we'll have the center to come in underneath,

1452
01:34:18,809 --> 01:34:22,007
and that way if they figure it out they'll have to
come from either side.

1453
01:34:22,007 --> 01:34:26,270
WILL: The 50 men holding the wall, the chances of
any of them getting out are slim, but they're

1454
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,582
going to know that going in.

1455
01:34:27,582 --> 01:34:28,970
LAURA: These guys are legit!

1456
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:31,591
SAM: We are the worst people.

1457
01:34:31,591 --> 01:34:34,456
LAURA: Apparently! Which is terrible. It really,
really is.

1458
01:34:34,456 --> 01:34:36,379
WILL: It's the end of the world, they know what's
happened.

1459
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:39,115
MARY: You've been dealing with dragons, we've been
thinking about it.

1460
01:34:39,115 --> 01:34:42,856
MARISHA: I'm still concerned we don't have enough
air support for the 500 wyverns.

1461
01:34:42,856 --> 01:34:45,774
MARY: I think we might have to let that go.

1462
01:34:45,774 --> 01:34:50,355
MATT: Allura chimes in and goes, "As far as I
understand, that's part of the reason you're

1463
01:34:50,355 --> 01:34:51,751
"bringing the mages with you."

1464
01:34:51,751 --> 01:34:53,847
MARISHA: Yes, well I'm thinking--

1465
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:55,194
TALIESIN: Ground to air.

1466
01:34:55,194 --> 01:34:56,694
WILL: How big is the airship?

1467
01:34:56,694 --> 01:35:00,423
MARISHA: I wasn't wanting to necessarily tap into
this resource unless necessary, but I think it's

1468
01:35:00,423 --> 01:35:06,975
necessary. I can contact the Air Ashari and have
them specifically on air support.

1469
01:35:06,975 --> 01:35:09,181
LIAM: And they can get themselves here quick, like
you?

1470
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:11,219
LAURA: They can go through trees, instant!

1471
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:14,226
TALIESIN: It can hold two dozen people on that
ship, right?

1472
01:35:14,226 --> 01:35:15,795
LAURA: We need all of the Ashari.

1473
01:35:15,795 --> 01:35:17,789
TALIESIN: It's about three cannonade?

1474
01:35:17,789 --> 01:35:22,286
MARY: Is there anyone that could put an illusion
on the airship to make it seem like another

1475
01:35:22,286 --> 01:35:23,459
dragon?

1476
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:27,811
SAM: I could put a slight illusion on it but it'd
be pretty easy--

1477
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:34,432
WILL: I'm just wondering if there's a way to draw
their air force to the airship and then blow it up?

1478
01:35:34,432 --> 01:35:39,336
LIAM: We also supposedly have a green dragon as an
ally.

1479
01:35:39,336 --> 01:35:40,750
SAM: Oh yeah!

1480
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:46,519
LAURA: I fucking forgot the Ravenites said they
would help us, too! I just remembered.

1481
01:35:46,519 --> 01:35:48,993
SAM: Well, we sent word to them, didn't we? Didn't
we send word to everybody?

1482
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:53,743
MATT: You sent word to a few specific entities,
not the Ravenites.

1483
01:35:53,743 --> 01:35:55,604
LAURA: How long would it take?

1484
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:59,275
TALIESIN: Vox Machina, swearing that they're going
to call you back for four years.

1485
01:35:59,275 --> 01:36:02,030
(laughter)

1486
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:04,978
LAURA: Fuck. Are they too far?

1487
01:36:04,978 --> 01:36:09,093
MATT: They're like a continent away.

1488
01:36:09,093 --> 01:36:11,160
WILL: Wait, you can bring in air force?

1489
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,785
MARISHA: I can contact my father at the Air
Ashari.

1490
01:36:14,785 --> 01:36:20,057
SAM: Do that. We also need to contact Gilmore.

1491
01:36:20,057 --> 01:36:22,174
WILL: If you control the air, you control the
battle.

1492
01:36:22,174 --> 01:36:24,928
MATT: "Gilmore is accompanying you, and I believe
Kima is going to come along as well".

1493
01:36:24,928 --> 01:36:26,436
TALIESIN: We also have your friend.

1494
01:36:26,436 --> 01:36:31,856
MATT: "The airship we don't know quite exactly
where it is and when it will arrive. I don't know

1495
01:36:31,856 --> 01:36:35,455
"if we can count on it being there by the time you
make this assault, but they're going there as soon

1496
01:36:35,455 --> 01:36:36,591
"as they can."

1497
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:40,661
TALIESIN: It has cannonade as well and it is
designed to hold sieges in the air, so it will

1498
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:43,421
keep many of them busy, and they're not that
bright.

1499
01:36:43,421 --> 01:36:45,970
WILL: If it's not coming though, you can't count
it among them.

1500
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:48,289
TALIESIN: We can't count on anything.That would
be--

1501
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:50,597
WILL: Huge.

1502
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:52,657
MARISHA: Can you message Korren?

1503
01:36:52,657 --> 01:36:55,134
MATT: "I've not met Korren."

1504
01:36:55,134 --> 01:36:56,552
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

1505
01:36:56,552 --> 01:36:59,812
MATT: "If you could take me to him--"

1506
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:10,420
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yeah, right. Yes. Because we're
not leaving until the morning now. Sure, yeah. Oh

1507
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:15,196
man (gasps) who wants to go see my hometown, you
guys?

1508
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:16,471
SAM: (dubious noise)

1509
01:37:16,471 --> 01:37:22,541
MARISHA: Okay. You know what? I wasn't looking at
you, Scanlan. Okay.

1510
01:37:22,689 --> 01:37:25,054
I can show you where I went to school!

1511
01:37:25,054 --> 01:37:28,352
MARY: Keyleth, we need to get back here as soon as
possible.

1512
01:37:28,352 --> 01:37:30,136
WILL: You went to school?

1513
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:35,389
(laughter)

1514
01:37:35,389 --> 01:37:38,162
LIAM: That was catty.

1515
01:37:38,162 --> 01:37:41,613
TALIESIN: We were like back in school suddenly,
that was great!

1516
01:37:41,613 --> 01:37:44,051
WILL: I formally apologize.

1517
01:37:44,051 --> 01:37:46,218
TALIESIN: That went so John Hughes, so quickly.

1518
01:37:46,218 --> 01:37:48,173
(laughter)

1519
01:37:48,173 --> 01:37:49,878
LAURA: Are we expecting you back tonight?

1520
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:55,007
MARY: And the rest of us can rest, yes?

1521
01:37:55,007 --> 01:37:58,702
MATT: "Rest and prepare for everything you can,
for tomorrow this happens."

1522
01:37:58,702 --> 01:38:00,524
(liquid pouring)

1523
01:38:00,524 --> 01:38:03,448
TALIESIN: I swear if you're aerating wine under
there I'm going to be so upset.

1524
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:07,082
(laughter)

1525
01:38:07,082 --> 01:38:10,015
WILL: I just saw it out of the corner, it was
great!

1526
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:14,236
MATT: All you had to do was ask, I'm working
toward getting the break, buddy!

1527
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:16,452
SAM: (sigh) Feels so much better!

1528
01:38:16,452 --> 01:38:24,615
MARY: Before we go to bed, I would like to talk to
Vex very quickly.

1529
01:38:24,615 --> 01:38:29,357
MATT: As you guys are going to prepare to make
your way to the Air Ashari, Zahra pulls you

1530
01:38:29,357 --> 01:38:30,528
aside.

1531
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,728
MARY: Darling?

1532
01:38:31,728 --> 01:38:32,571
LAURA: Yes?

1533
01:38:32,571 --> 01:38:40,689
MARY: I have major concerns about Raishan. I don't
know that we can trust her, I just want you to

1534
01:38:40,689 --> 01:38:52,299
keep your eyes on her. While you were gone, I
tried as hard as I could to glean anything from

1535
01:38:52,299 --> 01:39:00,957
her, and the closer I thought I got-- I found out
that I knew nothing about her. And she knows

1536
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:03,618
everything about me.

1537
01:39:03,618 --> 01:39:06,578
LAURA: She knows everything about all of us,
dear.

1538
01:39:06,578 --> 01:39:08,105
MARY: Don't trust her.

1539
01:39:08,105 --> 01:39:09,810
LAURA: Not even for a minute.

1540
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:17,307
MARY: Don't trust her. If it comes to it, I'll go
down taking her out.

1541
01:39:17,307 --> 01:39:19,544
LAURA: I'd rather you didn't.

1542
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:21,427
MARY: So would I.

1543
01:39:21,427 --> 01:39:26,510
LAURA: I have to do it, I have to insight check
Zahra to make sure she's really Zahra!

1544
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,189
SAM: Oh shit.

1545
01:39:28,189 --> 01:39:29,684
MATT: Make an insight check.

1546
01:39:29,684 --> 01:39:31,489
LIAM: No that's good. That's good.

1547
01:39:31,489 --> 01:39:33,142
LAURA: I love you.

1548
01:39:33,142 --> 01:39:35,980
LIAM: Pretty good.

1549
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:39,920
TALIESIN: I can also say there's an easy way to do
this--

1550
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,187
MATT: Turn that way real fast.

1551
01:39:42,187 --> 01:39:48,469
TALIESIN: Just go downstairs.

1552
01:39:48,469 --> 01:39:58,954
SAM: (in surfer accent) Hey guys, don't forget:
December's theme is "revolution!" Featuring items

1553
01:39:58,954 --> 01:40:05,943
from Assassin's Creed, Mr. Robot, Firefly and
more! Don't forget to go to

1554
01:40:05,943 --> 01:40:15,445
lootcrate.com/criticalrole, and enter 'critical
role' for 10% off, my bruh!

1555
01:40:15,445 --> 01:40:19,531
MATT: That's the worst use of Seeming I've ever
seen!

1556
01:40:19,531 --> 01:40:21,799
(laughter)

1557
01:40:21,799 --> 01:40:23,361
MATT: All righty.

1558
01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:27,420
LAURA: When did you even speak to her?

1559
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:32,791
MARY: While you were gone. You know I've been
spending time-- she's been down in the ziggurat.

1560
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:34,351
LAURA: Yes?

1561
01:40:34,351 --> 01:40:39,973
MARY: So I've seen her. I've seen her form, as I
guess you have as well.

1562
01:40:39,973 --> 01:40:41,345
LAURA: Yes.

1563
01:40:41,345 --> 01:40:46,448
MARY: After Rimefang, I sort of became obsessed
with dragons.

1564
01:40:46,448 --> 01:40:49,601
LAURA: I know the feeling. (laughs)

1565
01:40:49,601 --> 01:40:55,136
MARY: Yes, it's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? But
I also know that she was part of it, and the

1566
01:40:55,136 --> 01:40:57,508
minute a dragon says 'trust me' is the minute you
don't.

1567
01:40:57,508 --> 01:40:58,853
LAURA: Especially her.

1568
01:40:58,853 --> 01:41:05,145
MARY: Especially her. So while you were gone, I
tried. I tried to find out as much about Thordak

1569
01:41:05,145 --> 01:41:06,681
as I could.

1570
01:41:06,681 --> 01:41:10,485
LAURA: Just know that we don't trust her.

1571
01:41:10,485 --> 01:41:12,525
MARY: All right.

1572
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:15,109
LAURA: I don't even know if she's really sick.

1573
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:27,937
MARY: I actually believe her in that respect. But
Thordak is the only one that can cure her, and if

1574
01:41:27,937 --> 01:41:35,990
that's the case-- if she believes that-- then we
are nothing. We are expendable to her the minute

1575
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:43,959
she sees Thordak. That's the carrot that he has
put in front of her, is that 'I will heal you',

1576
01:41:43,959 --> 01:41:47,367
and he hasn't done it yet. I don't think he will.

1577
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:49,619
LAURA: I don't think he really can.

1578
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:57,398
MARY: If he does, we're fucked. That's all.

1579
01:41:57,398 --> 01:42:01,036
LAURA: You're not alone in this, at least.

1580
01:42:01,036 --> 01:42:03,087
MARY: Good. That's good.

1581
01:42:03,087 --> 01:42:05,233
LAURA: She's not our friend.

1582
01:42:05,233 --> 01:42:13,010
MARY: She can be persuasive. Thank you, darling.

1583
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:18,627
MATT: You separate for the evening to gather your
mind, gather your supplies and prepare for the

1584
01:42:18,627 --> 01:42:24,211
coming battle. While the rest of you find
yourselves resting for the evening, Keyleth and

1585
01:42:24,211 --> 01:42:27,570
Vax find yourselves walking towards the Sun Tree
to make your journey.

1586
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:29,399
MARISHA: Is Allura coming with us, too?

1587
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:30,664
MATT: If you want to ask her to come with you.

1588
01:42:30,664 --> 01:42:31,992
MARISHA: I thought she was.

1589
01:42:31,992 --> 01:42:33,833
MATT: I'm sorry, yeah.

1590
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:36,007
MARISHA: She doesn't have to.

1591
01:42:36,007 --> 01:42:37,604
MATT: You're right, no, she goes with you.

1592
01:42:37,604 --> 01:42:39,007
MARISHA: Okay, come on, Allura, let's go!

1593
01:42:39,007 --> 01:42:40,594
MATT: "Of course! Certainly."

1594
01:42:40,594 --> 01:42:44,071
MARISHA: It's great, we have these really great
crepes that we make. It's like our hometown

1595
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:45,157
special.

1596
01:42:45,157 --> 01:42:47,951
MATT: "If there's time, I would love to have some.
Don't know if we'll have time."

1597
01:42:47,951 --> 01:42:49,202
MARISHA: Okay, okay!

1598
01:42:49,202 --> 01:42:56,285
MATT: So you all walk your way down to the Sun
Tree. You open the portal. Immediately on the

1599
01:42:56,285 --> 01:43:05,509
opposite side you see-- as it is nighttime in this
part of Exandria's hemisphere-- what looks to be a

1600
01:43:05,509 --> 01:43:15,568
beautiful, simple village made of curved wood,
almost dome-type structures, but not huts, there's

1601
01:43:15,568 --> 01:43:21,836
no thatch. They're really well-crafted, long,
intricate strips of wood like it's been grown to a

1602
01:43:21,836 --> 01:43:26,014
specific shape. It creates these interesting
domiciles that are all built, you see beyond that,

1603
01:43:26,014 --> 01:43:32,179
on the edge of a sheer cliff, and the minute you step
through the wind hits you. There is a strong wind

1604
01:43:32,179 --> 01:43:36,736
immediately on the outside of this tree, and you
feel your cloak being blown to the side. You look

1605
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:41,886
over behind the tree that you just stepped out of,
and it's another cliff that vanishes into darkness

1606
01:43:41,886 --> 01:43:49,837
below. The Air Ashari village of Zephrah lies at
the very top of this mountain range. For a brief

1607
01:43:49,837 --> 01:43:55,117
second, you get vertigo, glancing over your
shoulder. Keyleth steps through with a big smile

1608
01:43:55,117 --> 01:44:03,885
on her face. You see Allura step through, and as
soon as she sees this happen she clasps and keeps

1609
01:44:03,885 --> 01:44:10,270
her hair down, not wanting to be like you right
now with your hair (blowing) in the wind.

1610
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:19,845
You take a few steps toward the village. Probably
close to 100 homes at most, built into the

1611
01:44:19,845 --> 01:44:25,594
mountainside. It goes up into a hill with trees
that surround the outskirts of it. You see small

1612
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:32,352
lights that are lit throughout so it has this
firefly feel glimmering through. As soon as you

1613
01:44:32,352 --> 01:44:36,698
step maybe ten or 15 feet from the tree, the wind
just stops.

1614
01:44:36,698 --> 01:44:41,154
LIAM: What happened to the wind?

1615
01:44:41,154 --> 01:44:46,014
MARISHA: I mean, we're Air Ashari, we don't have
to live in a hellscape our whole lives! Come on,

1616
01:44:46,014 --> 01:44:50,959
we control it, it's great! (sighs) Doesn't it
smell good? It smells so fresh up here, you know?

1617
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:55,634
You don't have to deal with the pollution down
there. Oh look! Over there, that's where I learned

1618
01:44:55,634 --> 01:44:58,135
to shapeshift into a squirrel for the first
time--

1619
01:44:58,135 --> 01:45:00,391
MATT: "Keyleth? Keyleth. We're here on
business--"

1620
01:45:00,391 --> 01:45:02,663
MARISHA: Yeah no, then let's start walking!

1621
01:45:02,663 --> 01:45:04,091
MATT: "Please lead on."

1622
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:08,757
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. And over there was the first
time that my dad taught me how to fly. He just

1623
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:10,085
pushed me off the cliff--!

1624
01:45:10,085 --> 01:45:11,832
LIAM: I have my hand on her back and I just
start--

1625
01:45:11,832 --> 01:45:13,411
MATT: (laughing) Pushing her forward?

1626
01:45:13,411 --> 01:45:21,872
You eventually make your way back. There are a
number of trees that are grown through some of the

1627
01:45:21,872 --> 01:45:28,192
buildings, or buildings are built around them, or
from them. It's a very beautiful, simple,

1628
01:45:28,192 --> 01:45:36,619
natural-looking series of structures that are all
so smooth in their design that it was obviously

1629
01:45:36,619 --> 01:45:39,690
bent with some druidic magic to craft this space.

1630
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:46,722
Currently there is nobody you see visible walking
through the city, most everything is closed off

1631
01:45:46,722 --> 01:45:53,448
for the night. The little lantern-like lights you
saw before are coming from the inside of these

1632
01:45:53,448 --> 01:45:55,017
buildings.

1633
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:58,652
MARISHA: It's a quiet mountain town, everything
closes at like five, it was actually annoying

1634
01:45:58,652 --> 01:45:59,941
growing up.

1635
01:45:59,941 --> 01:46:02,615
MARY: You live in South Pointe?

1636
01:46:02,615 --> 01:46:08,743
LIAM: That explains so much.

1637
01:46:08,743 --> 01:46:12,221
(laughter)

1638
01:46:12,221 --> 01:46:15,483
MARISHA: I told you it was remote!

1639
01:46:15,483 --> 01:46:18,530
MATT: I want both of you to roll a perception
check.

1640
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:24,541
MARISHA: 14 total.

1641
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:25,957
LIAM: 22.

1642
01:46:25,957 --> 01:46:31,633
MATT: Okay. As she's talking and you guys are
walking, you notice a little dark spot, just

1643
01:46:31,633 --> 01:46:36,939
covering past the stars, arcing quickly in your
direction.

1644
01:46:36,939 --> 01:46:42,841
LIAM: I spin her around and tilt her head back.
What's that? Do you know what that is? Is that

1645
01:46:42,841 --> 01:46:43,956
normal?

1646
01:46:43,956 --> 01:46:45,567
MARISHA: Do I know what that is, is that normal?

1647
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:57,944
MATT: Once you see it, you recognize the
trajectory of it. This is a person rocketing

1648
01:46:57,944 --> 01:46:59,315
toward you.

1649
01:46:59,315 --> 01:47:00,626
MARISHA: Oh, that's a person!

1650
01:47:00,626 --> 01:47:02,784
(laughter)

1651
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,189
MARISHA: No really, is this normal?

1652
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:10,107
MATT: It's normal for you, because this is a
person riding a skysail.

1653
01:47:10,107 --> 01:47:14,736
MARISHA: Oh, it is normal for me? Oh, like a--?
Yeah!

1654
01:47:14,736 --> 01:47:28,911
MATT: As the person swoops up and then lands--
it's a sort of glider. It resembles a pogo stick

1655
01:47:28,911 --> 01:47:32,691
in the fact that feet are placed on top of it, and
elements are grasped on the side. It's a large,

1656
01:47:32,691 --> 01:47:40,960
leather-winged structure that immediately folds up
and is held like a staff to the side.

1657
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,482
LIAM: Whoa, that's nifty! Hi!

1658
01:47:43,482 --> 01:47:48,542
MATT: Standing before you is Korren, your father.

1659
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:50,168
MARISHA: Dad!

1660
01:47:50,168 --> 01:47:55,537
MATT: He looks surprised. He lands in a very
aggressive, coming-to-see-what's-going-on-type

1661
01:47:55,537 --> 01:48:00,166
way, and as soon as he looks, "Keyleth! I wasn't
expecting--"

1662
01:48:00,166 --> 01:48:09,593
MARSIHA: Hi! Village looks great! I see you guys
have been keeping up with the landscaping, this is

1663
01:48:09,593 --> 01:48:11,557
awesome. Hi, how are you?

1664
01:48:11,557 --> 01:48:18,435
MATT: He hugs you, but it's a tense hug and he
pats your shoulder. "We're good. I--"

1665
01:48:18,435 --> 01:48:20,152
MARISHA: What's wrong?

1666
01:48:20,152 --> 01:48:31,637
MATT: "Well, things as they are, I know you're
probably here for not a passing visit. Am I

1667
01:48:31,637 --> 01:48:33,593
"correct in this assumption?"

1668
01:48:33,593 --> 01:48:38,181
MARISHA: I mean, I guess you could say it was
going to be passing in that we don't have a lot of

1669
01:48:38,181 --> 01:48:42,169
time. We're here to ask for help, for the Air
Ashari's aid.

1670
01:48:42,169 --> 01:48:51,645
MATT: "We were waiting for specific word based on
our last conversation. We have ways of finding

1671
01:48:51,645 --> 01:48:56,187
"information about what's going on in the world,
with the armies that have been mounting making

1672
01:48:56,187 --> 01:49:00,918
"their way towards Emon we've been keeping a watch
on the gathering energy toward the west coast of

1673
01:49:00,918 --> 01:49:09,821
"Tal'dorei. We were preparing ourselves. So if
you've come to ask for our aid, we're ready."

1674
01:49:09,821 --> 01:49:12,742
MARISHA: Why do I sense trepidation in your
voice?

1675
01:49:12,742 --> 01:49:18,955
MATT: "Because we know what we face. Because my
daughter is going to war against something that we

1676
01:49:18,955 --> 01:49:31,119
"watched tear through the countryside not long
after you were born. I'm just concerned as a

1677
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,082
"parent. That is all."

1678
01:49:34,082 --> 01:49:44,062
MARISHA: You sent me on this path to prove myself
worthy and a hero. I'm following what I thought

1679
01:49:44,062 --> 01:49:45,555
you wanted of me.

1680
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:51,727
MATT: "You are, and I'm proud of you. I just want
to do what I can to help safeguard that."

1681
01:49:51,727 --> 01:50:04,727
MARISHA: I will continue my duties as I promised
from the beginning.

1682
01:50:04,727 --> 01:50:06,674
MATT: "Of course".

1683
01:50:06,674 --> 01:50:09,131
MARISHA: As those supersede being your daughter.

1684
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:10,701
MATT: "Of course."

1685
01:50:10,701 --> 01:50:24,234
MARISHA: And I am here for unfortunate reasons,
and I wish I wasn't. We need the best. We need as

1686
01:50:24,234 --> 01:50:36,767
many of the top soldiers that we have. I'm looking
at you, at my people, for air support. There's

1687
01:50:36,767 --> 01:50:44,756
about five, maybe six hundred, maybe even more
wyverns covering the city. So far we don't have a

1688
01:50:44,756 --> 01:50:46,319
lot of options.

1689
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:58,327
MATT: "We know wyverns well, that's the good news.
We can probably facilitate this request."

1690
01:50:58,327 --> 01:51:05,058
MARISHA: I was hoping maybe some of the best
nature manipulators could create a hazardous storm

1691
01:51:05,058 --> 01:51:08,335
ahead of time? See what we can do to take out as
much in bulk.

1692
01:51:08,335 --> 01:51:10,201
MATT: "We can do that. Yeah."

1693
01:51:10,201 --> 01:51:11,759
SAM: (whispering) She went to school.

1694
01:51:11,759 --> 01:51:13,798
MARISHA: I know, I got educated!

1695
01:51:13,798 --> 01:51:20,028
MATT: "We can do that. When is this set to
happen?"

1696
01:51:20,028 --> 01:51:23,409
MARISHA: Tomorrow afternoon.

1697
01:51:23,409 --> 01:51:31,461
MATT: "All right, we'll get our conjurers together
and begin building a storm front. We'll send it

1698
01:51:31,461 --> 01:51:38,054
"mid-day tomorrow. Then what sign should we look
for to enter the fray?"

1699
01:51:38,054 --> 01:51:40,874
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1700
01:51:40,874 --> 01:51:42,559
SAM: Just anything.

1701
01:51:42,559 --> 01:51:47,238
LIAM: A flare, we have flares. Kiki, we have
flares.

1702
01:51:47,238 --> 01:51:51,695
MARISHA: We have flares.

1703
01:51:51,695 --> 01:51:54,443
(laughter)

1704
01:51:54,443 --> 01:51:56,060
MATT: "Very well."

1705
01:51:56,060 --> 01:52:00,120
(laughter)

1706
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:08,663
MARISHA: We're spitballing this as we go, dad. So
we can work on a sign together, right?

1707
01:52:08,663 --> 01:52:18,780
MATT: "Sure, I mean, if we're creating a sky of
rain and darkness, just make the sky itself a sign."

1708
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:21,147
MARISHA: I can do that.

1709
01:52:21,147 --> 01:52:23,721
MATT: "All right. Something I'd know, something
I'd recognize."

1710
01:52:23,721 --> 01:52:25,023
MARISHA: Okay.

1711
01:52:25,023 --> 01:52:29,473
MATT: "We'll go in there and tear as many of those
wyverns as we can to the ground."

1712
01:52:29,473 --> 01:52:34,987
LIAM: You're not alone, there is an army of elves
marching as we speak.

1713
01:52:34,987 --> 01:52:37,570
MARISHA: The Syngorn army.

1714
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:43,427
MATT: "We've seen them traversing. Their illusions
are strong but their illusions are faced towards

1715
01:52:43,427 --> 01:52:51,959
"the city. We have the luxury of knowing their
magic. So, yes."

1716
01:52:51,959 --> 01:52:59,239
MARISHA: With all due respect, if you have seen
through their illusion, does that mean-- I'm sure

1717
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:01,985
many of Thordak's spies could do the same?

1718
01:53:01,985 --> 01:53:06,621
MATT: "It depends on who he has on his side. I
hope that's not the case."

1719
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:13,581
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. Are you going to come as
well?

1720
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:23,651
MATT: "I do not wish to live in a world where the
dangers that continue to press upon the free

1721
01:53:23,651 --> 01:53:29,456
"peoples of this or any land draws my daughter to
the front lines to fight, kill, and possibly die,

1722
01:53:29,456 --> 01:53:33,265
"and I stay back and do nothing. So yes, I will be
there."

1723
01:53:33,265 --> 01:53:40,740
MARISHA What about Zephrah? What about the
village? Who is going to watch it while you're gone?

1724
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:48,377
MATT: "We have enough to spare for this and
protect our people. Besides, as you well know, the

1725
01:53:48,377 --> 01:53:53,897
"protections in this village prevent wayward
fliers."

1726
01:53:53,897 --> 01:54:02,270
MARISHA: Okay. This is Vax, by the way.

1727
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,603
MATT: "We've met."

1728
01:54:03,603 --> 01:54:05,208
MARISHA: Yeah, you have.

1729
01:54:05,208 --> 01:54:06,909
MATT: "Good to see you."

1730
01:54:06,909 --> 01:54:19,572
MARISHA: He came with me. So--? Yeah. See you
tomorrow, I guess?

1731
01:54:19,572 --> 01:54:21,599
MATT: "See you tomorrow."

1732
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:26,335
LIAM: A great many people are grateful for your
aid, as am I.

1733
01:54:26,335 --> 01:54:29,988
MATT: "And I'm grateful for yours."

1734
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,097
LIAM: You're a good man.

1735
01:54:33,097 --> 01:54:36,618
MATT: "Prove to me you're one as well."

1736
01:54:36,618 --> 01:54:41,544
(laughter)

1737
01:54:41,544 --> 01:54:47,931
TALIESIN: Cleaning the shotgun.

1738
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:50,555
MATT: "But we have a lot to plan, I'm sure you do
as well."

1739
01:54:50,555 --> 01:54:51,810
MARISHA: Yes.

1740
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:57,970
MATT: "Good night." He pulls you in and kisses you
on the forehead, and gives you a long look.

1741
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:01,269
MARISHA: I just give him a big hug in response.

1742
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:09,134
MATT: He holds you there for a second, then looks
back over at you as he's holding her.

1743
01:55:09,134 --> 01:55:11,354
LIAM: I just nod my head.

1744
01:55:11,354 --> 01:55:12,913
MARISHA: I miss you, Dad.

1745
01:55:12,913 --> 01:55:22,940
MATT: "I miss you, too. When all this is done, do
you still intend to finish your Aramente? Do it

1746
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:26,030
"quickly. Come back to us, please. You're missed."

1747
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:30,608
MARISHA: You have my word. I won't let you down.

1748
01:55:30,608 --> 01:55:39,996
MATT: "I know. Anyway." He slams on the ground and
the leather flares out into arcing-looking

1749
01:55:39,996 --> 01:55:44,430
fingers, and he steps on.

1750
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:47,843
MARISHA: Are these the new models? They've really
upgraded them.

1751
01:55:47,843 --> 01:55:49,660
MATT: "No, you've just been gone for a while."

1752
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:50,914
MARISHA: Have I been gone that long?

1753
01:55:50,914 --> 01:55:52,307
MATT: "You've been gone a while."

1754
01:55:52,307 --> 01:55:53,618
MARISHA: Well, they look great!

1755
01:55:53,618 --> 01:55:54,599
MATT: "Thank you."

1756
01:55:54,599 --> 01:55:56,558
MARISHA: Okay, all right, okay, bye.

1757
01:55:56,558 --> 01:56:04,418
MATT: "Good night." As the wind picks up under
him, the skysail begins to lift and glide off. He

1758
01:56:04,418 --> 01:56:06,400
heads back toward the village.

1759
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,846
LIAM: That is fucking cool. We should get out of
here.

1760
01:56:11,846 --> 01:56:13,632
MARISHA: Yeah, we should.

1761
01:56:13,632 --> 01:56:15,913
LIAM: Allura?

1762
01:56:15,913 --> 01:56:19,184
MATT: "Yes, I believe we should. Well, it was nice
to meet him."

1763
01:56:19,184 --> 01:56:22,923
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right. Sorry, I should have
introduced you, I guess.

1764
01:56:22,923 --> 01:56:24,221
MATT: "I was waiting."

1765
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:31,207
(laughter)

1766
01:56:31,207 --> 01:56:37,808
MATT: "As are the expected pleasantries of
diplomacy. But it seems you had it all taken care

1767
01:56:37,808 --> 01:56:39,299
"of, so it's fine."

1768
01:56:39,299 --> 01:56:43,494
MARISHA: Sorry, I got distracted by talking to you
as my father and not as Allura!

1769
01:56:43,494 --> 01:56:47,601
LIAM: It was so weird though, you were standing
directly behind him.

1770
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:51,407
(laughter)

1771
01:56:51,407 --> 01:56:57,402
MATT: "It's all right, don't worry, it is a bit
cold, if we could get back please?" She's rubbing

1772
01:56:57,402 --> 01:56:59,651
her shoulders and arms a bit.

1773
01:56:59,651 --> 01:57:02,742
MARISHA: That was my dad, let's go.

1774
01:57:02,742 --> 01:57:07,374
MATT: All right, you guys head back, exiting out
the Sun Tree, making your way back.

1775
01:57:07,374 --> 01:57:15,109
LIAM: I catch her by the arm. I can't wait to come
back. Let's go!

1776
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:18,161
MARISHA: When we come back, I'll have to show you
the first time I--

1777
01:57:18,161 --> 01:57:19,816
LIAM: Let's go! Let's go, please!

1778
01:57:19,816 --> 01:57:21,879
(laughter)

1779
01:57:21,879 --> 01:57:27,497
MATT: You make your way back to castle Whitestone,
preparing your materials, your weapons, your minds

1780
01:57:27,497 --> 01:57:29,949
and your disposition for the coming war tomorrow.

1781
01:57:29,949 --> 01:57:31,619
TALIESIN: I have a quick thing!

1782
01:57:31,619 --> 01:57:34,366
SAM: Shit, Taliesin, shit!

1783
01:57:34,366 --> 01:57:37,826
TALIESIN: I knock on Vex's door. I have a bag, and
I go to Vex's door and knock on her door.

1784
01:57:37,826 --> 01:57:39,935
LAURA: Hello, who is it?

1785
01:57:39,935 --> 01:57:41,590
SAM: It's a bag of dicks.

1786
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:46,558
TALIESIN: You're terrible. It's me, I have
something to show you.

1787
01:57:46,558 --> 01:57:48,065
LAURA: (faux surprise) Percy?

1788
01:57:48,065 --> 01:57:52,352
TALIESIN: No, I'm an evil green dragon, let me
in.

1789
01:57:52,352 --> 01:57:54,493
LAURA: Are you here for our later talk?

1790
01:57:54,493 --> 01:57:57,560
TALIESIN: No this is a very-- open the door, I
have something to show you.

1791
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:01,455
LAURA: Fine. I open the door completely naked!

1792
01:58:01,455 --> 01:58:03,304
MARISHA: Ooh!

1793
01:58:03,304 --> 01:58:05,259
LAURA: What was it, dear?

1794
01:58:05,259 --> 01:58:07,164
MARISHA: (laughs) It's a power play, I love it!

1795
01:58:07,164 --> 01:58:12,684
TALIESIN: I don't remember but it was mostly to
head in this direction. Can I come in?

1796
01:58:12,684 --> 01:58:17,785
LAURA: Sure, of course! Would you like to talk
before, or after?

1797
01:58:17,785 --> 01:58:21,355
TALIESIN: I open the bag.

1798
01:58:21,355 --> 01:58:23,820
(laughter)

1799
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:29,367
TALIESIN: I pull out the first bottle. This is
called Dire Heart. I pull out the second one. This

1800
01:58:29,367 --> 01:58:34,581
we simply call Courage. I pull out the third one.
And this is a snow mead. And this is Green Tear

1801
01:58:34,581 --> 01:58:35,701
Whiskey.

1802
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:37,233
LIAM: Drink the Courage one now.

1803
01:58:37,233 --> 01:58:42,737
TALIESIN: We're going to start with the Courage
and not talk about dragons. And I run in and shut

1804
01:58:42,737 --> 01:58:49,609
the door. You just stepped on the whole thing,
didn't you?

1805
01:58:49,609 --> 01:58:53,367
(laughter)

1806
01:58:53,367 --> 01:58:54,905
MATT: That was beautiful!

1807
01:58:54,905 --> 01:58:56,686
MARY: I can't wait for the artwork!

1808
01:58:56,686 --> 01:58:58,095
(laughter)

1809
01:58:58,095 --> 01:59:02,734
TALIESIN: I will be expecting labels for all of
them.

1810
01:59:02,734 --> 01:59:05,072
LIAM: You can't always be in control, Percy.

1811
01:59:05,072 --> 01:59:07,150
TALIESIN: No, I can't. It's beautiful.

1812
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:08,496
MARY: Not when Vex is around.

1813
01:59:08,496 --> 01:59:12,293
MATT: Awesome. While you guys rest, most of you
rest for the evening, we're going to go ahead and

1814
01:59:12,293 --> 01:59:16,052
take a restroom break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes to continue the story. Stick around for

1815
01:59:16,052 --> 01:59:20,447
the break for a wonderful video message from
Patrick Rothfuss about the Worldbuilders charity

1816
01:59:20,447 --> 01:59:24,647
that we're supporting. Information will be coming
up here shortly. See you in a bit!

1817
01:59:24,647 --> 02:18:11,368
[break]

1818
02:18:11,368 --> 02:18:17,476
MATT: And welcome back, everyone, to Critical
Role, as we come back from the break. We will have

1819
02:18:17,476 --> 02:18:24,954
a winner from the chat room giveaway from our
friends at Wyrmwood. We are giving away an awesome

1820
02:18:24,954 --> 02:18:32,596
English Wych Elm Burl Personal Dice Tray winner if
you guys were in chat. It's actually, this is

1821
02:18:32,596 --> 02:18:41,781
really cool. If I pull it out of the box there.
It's got a leather interior, it's awesome. And it

1822
02:18:41,781 --> 02:18:43,814
goes to Jaanro.

1823
02:18:43,814 --> 02:18:49,252
(cheering)

1824
02:18:49,252 --> 02:18:58,189
MATT: So we'll get that to you very soon. Go ahead
and make sure to contact some of the crew here, or

1825
02:18:58,189 --> 02:19:03,989
the mods, and get your information to get this out
to you ASAP, so congratulations. And thank you once

1826
02:19:04,098 --> 02:19:06,618
again, Wyrmwood, for making this possible.

1827
02:19:06,618 --> 02:19:10,244
MARISHA: And by ASAP we mean as soon as we get out
the other 20 packages we need to get out and then

1828
02:19:10,244 --> 02:19:12,964
you're in the queue! Welcome to being in line.

1829
02:19:12,964 --> 02:19:17,968
TALIESIN: It's like the kickstarter you didn't
sign up for. It's coming!

1830
02:19:17,968 --> 02:19:20,180
MARISHA: I didn't want this.

1831
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:29,688
MATT: All right! So, coming back into our game.
Get my music situated here. [very loud music] Oh

1832
02:19:29,688 --> 02:19:38,168
my, volume! So, as you all slowly come to
consciousnesses the following morning, well-rested

1833
02:19:38,168 --> 02:19:46,868
for the most part. You gather your supplies, you
prepare whatever else you prepared before, making

1834
02:19:46,868 --> 02:19:52,952
your way to the coming battle. So, what do you
guys want to do?

1835
02:19:52,952 --> 02:19:55,086
SAM: Go to the coming battle?

1836
02:19:55,086 --> 02:19:56,124
MARY: Yes.

1837
02:19:56,124 --> 02:19:59,560
MATT: All right, if you have all your things
situated, you wait throughout the day, anxiously,

1838
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:03,434
eating your meal, looking to--

1839
02:20:03,434 --> 02:20:05,819
LIAM: Why is the music so--

1840
02:20:05,819 --> 02:20:07,697
MATT: The music is intense here.

1841
02:20:07,697 --> 02:20:09,307
LIAM: Is he here now?

1842
02:20:09,307 --> 02:20:14,080
SAM: I attack Zahra!

1843
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:18,701
MARY: I use Witch Bolt on Scanlan!

1844
02:20:18,701 --> 02:20:21,585
TALIESIN: It's like that random Final Fantasy
encounter just happened and you're like, I only

1845
02:20:21,585 --> 02:20:23,021
got ten feet.

1846
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:25,495
MARISHA: I just got out of the shop. <i>Just</i> got
out.

1847
02:20:25,495 --> 02:20:27,360
MARY: And in that moment, we fall in love.

1848
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:31,180
WILL: If it's the <i>final</i> fantasy, why are there
14 of them?

1849
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:33,729
MARISHA: Every J-RPG.

1850
02:20:33,729 --> 02:20:35,585
MATT: We're fixing the audio.

1851
02:20:35,585 --> 02:20:39,036
(loud wind instruments)

1852
02:20:39,036 --> 02:20:40,961
MATT: I don't think this is mine, either.

1853
02:20:40,961 --> 02:20:44,005
SAM: Is this just a radio station that we're
picking up?

1854
02:20:44,005 --> 02:20:47,354
WILL: You're listening to the sounds of
Whitestone.

1855
02:20:47,354 --> 02:20:51,025
MARY: On WNBC radio!

1856
02:20:51,025 --> 02:20:57,935
WILL: This is dragon radio. Giving a shout-out to
the Conclave, Vox Machina...

1857
02:20:57,935 --> 02:21:05,265
MATT: Okay. I think we're at my tracks. Okay.
Thank you for your patience. I need my music. It's

1858
02:21:05,265 --> 02:21:10,565
just a thing; I need to have it there. I can't
focus and dungeon master if I forget the music.

1859
02:21:10,565 --> 02:21:19,708
What? So, thank you, guys. Pushing through the
day, working through the antsiness of the coming

1860
02:21:19,708 --> 02:21:30,381
conflict. Allura, communicating back and forth,
gets word that the forces have gathered,

1861
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:37,821
temporarily set up camp to arm themselves and
prepare for the battle once sundown hits.

1862
02:21:37,821 --> 02:21:41,158
Warmaster Mikael Daxio is awaiting your arrival.

1863
02:21:41,158 --> 02:21:51,963
LAURA: I have a question. I have a question. I'm
going to attune the Boots of Haste that I took

1864
02:21:51,963 --> 02:21:53,601
from my brother just now.

1865
02:21:53,601 --> 02:21:55,740
LIAM: That your brother gave to you.

1866
02:21:55,740 --> 02:22:03,878
LAURA: That my brother gave to me. And if I
un-attune my Coldsnap Armor, do I just lose the

1867
02:22:03,878 --> 02:22:05,272
cold resistance?

1868
02:22:05,272 --> 02:22:09,907
MATT: And any sort of armor bonus that it gave
you. I mean, you would still have the armor. Like,

1869
02:22:09,907 --> 02:22:15,817
if it's leather armor, it would give you a bonus
of two to your AC. But if it's a plus two armor,

1870
02:22:15,817 --> 02:22:18,904
you would lose the plus two on top of the actual
armor.

1871
02:22:18,904 --> 02:22:25,858
LAURA: That's a big drop. I'm going to take my
bracers off, then.

1872
02:22:25,858 --> 02:22:27,818
MATT: Okay, so you're doing two less damage per
attack.

1873
02:22:27,818 --> 02:22:29,051
LAURA: Yes.

1874
02:22:29,051 --> 02:22:30,281
MATT: Okay.

1875
02:22:30,281 --> 02:22:32,414
LIAM: That's smarter. That's wise.

1876
02:22:32,414 --> 02:22:34,486
MARY: I'm going to attune my Charred Dark Staff.

1877
02:22:34,486 --> 02:22:36,231
MATT: All right. Good.

1878
02:22:36,231 --> 02:22:44,120
MARISHA: And I'm going to go ahead and attune to
my cape, instead of my ring.

1879
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:47,667
MATT: Okay.

1880
02:22:47,667 --> 02:22:52,850
LIAM: I'm attuning the dragon sword, and I want to
use it a little bit just so I don't get pantsed in

1881
02:22:52,850 --> 02:22:57,089
the moment. Does it work all right; am I all right
with this? It's awfully large.

1882
02:22:57,089 --> 02:22:59,197
MATT: It's bigger than what you're used to.

1883
02:22:59,197 --> 02:23:00,443
LIAM: Yeah.

1884
02:23:00,443 --> 02:23:02,524
WILL: Do you want to spar?

1885
02:23:02,524 --> 02:23:04,156
MATT: But even still--

1886
02:23:04,156 --> 02:23:07,908
TALIESIN: It won't do a bonus to him. He's not a
dragon.

1887
02:23:07,908 --> 02:23:09,528
LIAM: I mean, I'd like to, but do we have time?

1888
02:23:09,528 --> 02:23:11,974
MATT: You could give it a shot.

1889
02:23:11,974 --> 02:23:13,258
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

1890
02:23:13,258 --> 02:23:18,299
MATT: All right, so the two of you square off
briefly out in the streets just outside of the

1891
02:23:18,299 --> 02:23:20,615
guard barracks.

1892
02:23:20,615 --> 02:23:22,395
LAURA: I whisper in my brother's ear.

1893
02:23:22,395 --> 02:23:23,794
LIAM: What?

1894
02:23:23,794 --> 02:23:29,920
LAURA: Just be careful because-- What? What?

1895
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,668
LIAM: Nothing. What were you going to say?

1896
02:23:31,668 --> 02:23:33,761
LAURA: Be careful; I think he has a grudge against
you.

1897
02:23:33,761 --> 02:23:35,120
LIAM: For what?

1898
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,433
LAURA: Just go. You'll be great.

1899
02:23:37,433 --> 02:23:39,314
WILL: Am I fighting you or your sister?

1900
02:23:39,314 --> 02:23:42,134
LIAM: It's really the same thing, at all times.

1901
02:23:42,134 --> 02:23:44,878
MARY: I use Awakened Mind and I say, Kash, go easy
on him.

1902
02:23:44,878 --> 02:23:47,314
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, shit.

1903
02:23:47,314 --> 02:23:53,698
WILL: We're going easy. I just want to make sure
that you and your blade are one before you go into

1904
02:23:53,698 --> 02:23:56,123
battle. It's a bad time to find out you don't know
how to use it.

1905
02:23:56,123 --> 02:23:58,222
LIAM: I poke him in the knee with my sword.

1906
02:23:58,222 --> 02:23:59,854
(laughter)

1907
02:23:59,854 --> 02:24:01,414
MATT: Roll an attack.

1908
02:24:01,414 --> 02:24:05,116
LIAM: That is-- Is this a sneak attack?

1909
02:24:05,116 --> 02:24:06,428
MATT: No.

1910
02:24:06,428 --> 02:24:08,215
LIAM: No, it's just 28.

1911
02:24:08,215 --> 02:24:13,225
MATT: All right, so yeah. So, as you say that, he
smiles, and before you even notice, you hear a

1912
02:24:13,225 --> 02:24:16,187
ping! and you feel a slight vibration into your
lower pauldron, and you look down and the sword

1913
02:24:16,187 --> 02:24:20,883
has not hurt you, but it has definitely pierced
the plates behind the armor and he's showing, he's

1914
02:24:20,883 --> 02:24:25,523
posturing that he already has availability with
the blade between your armor.

1915
02:24:25,523 --> 02:24:27,686
WILL: Interesting.

1916
02:24:27,686 --> 02:24:29,860
LIAM: I jump back five feet.

1917
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:32,432
(laughter)

1918
02:24:32,432 --> 02:24:34,597
WILL: I Flame Strike! No, I'm kidding.

1919
02:24:34,597 --> 02:24:36,859
(laughter)

1920
02:24:36,859 --> 02:24:38,282
LIAM: Evasion!

1921
02:24:38,282 --> 02:24:40,036
WILL: Just jump right to it.

1922
02:24:40,036 --> 02:24:46,556
MATT: "Where's Vox Machina?" "Well, um. They
killed each other. It's weird."

1923
02:24:46,556 --> 02:24:48,472
(laughter)

1924
02:24:48,472 --> 02:24:53,792
So as you both stand there, in a moment, squaring
off, the tension still in the city from the coming

1925
02:24:53,792 --> 02:24:57,273
event, but people are starting to look out and
gather. They're having a "Morpheus is fighting

1926
02:24:57,273 --> 02:25:01,074
Neo" moment as people are starting to pull others
from nearby buildings, and gather in a small

1927
02:25:01,074 --> 02:25:02,567
circle around.

1928
02:25:02,567 --> 02:25:07,327
MARISHA: Yeah, I go up to Vex, and go: why-- Why
is this happening? Is this happening for, like,

1929
02:25:07,327 --> 02:25:09,308
a-- Did they tell you-- Did they tell you the
reason?

1930
02:25:09,308 --> 02:25:11,455
LAURA: They're fighting over you, darling. They're
fighting over you.

1931
02:25:11,455 --> 02:25:15,710
MARISHA: I can tell-- I've been with you for a
long time. I can tell when you're lying to me.

1932
02:25:15,710 --> 02:25:17,348
LAURA: They both professed their love and now
they're fighting.

1933
02:25:17,348 --> 02:25:18,972
MARISHA: Now you're patronizing me.

1934
02:25:18,972 --> 02:25:23,008
LIAM: (calls) We're really not that far away! Are
we going to do this? You ready?

1935
02:25:23,008 --> 02:25:24,400
WILL: I'm ready when you are.

1936
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,635
MATT: Who's making the first move?

1937
02:25:25,635 --> 02:25:29,993
LIAM: Me. Are we doing initiative or attacks? I
don't even know what this is?

1938
02:25:29,993 --> 02:25:34,354
MATT: The initiative was whoever said "me" first,
so.

1939
02:25:34,354 --> 02:25:38,808
MARISHA: I didn't know how badly I wanted this
until now.

1940
02:25:38,808 --> 02:25:40,846
TALIESIN: Boy, I did.

1941
02:25:40,846 --> 02:25:47,696
LIAM: Oh, man, what are we fighting to? Here we
go. So that is the first and that is-- I'm going

1942
02:25:47,696 --> 02:25:49,310
to use Luck.

1943
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:53,038
MARISHA: You're about to fight a fucking dragon!
You're fighting Kash!

1944
02:25:53,038 --> 02:25:57,329
MATT: You do realize-- You only have-- You're
spending your Luck for--

1945
02:25:57,329 --> 02:26:02,655
LIAM: I spent it already. Just so we're clear,
everybody-- I'm going to switch back to Liam--

1946
02:26:02,655 --> 02:26:09,870
This is a game! This is a game. Which camera's on
me? <i>This is a game</i>!

1947
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:12,141
WILL: Your fun is wrong.

1948
02:26:12,141 --> 02:26:13,622
MARY: Your fun is very wrong.

1949
02:26:13,622 --> 02:26:15,180
LIAM: So it's an 18.

1950
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,972
MATT: An 18. What's your armor class? With your
shield?

1951
02:26:16,972 --> 02:26:18,580
WILL: My armor class is 20.

1952
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:20,465
MATT: As you go to strike with the sword--

1953
02:26:20,465 --> 02:26:21,573
LIAM: That's the first one.

1954
02:26:21,573 --> 02:26:24,481
MATT: Yes. With your sword. And so now you're
attacking with your--?

1955
02:26:24,481 --> 02:26:27,522
LIAM: Natural 20, with Whisper.

1956
02:26:27,522 --> 02:26:33,384
MATT: With Whisper, okay. All right. So, as he
swings with the sword, with your shield you

1957
02:26:33,384 --> 02:26:37,197
deflect it off to the side and you're about to
bring your spear through for your own strike.

1958
02:26:37,197 --> 02:26:42,346
However, he's suddenly much closer than you
expected, and you feel the blade shirk the side of

1959
02:26:42,346 --> 02:26:46,416
the armor. So for the purposes of this, we're not
rolling damage because it's to spar--

1960
02:26:46,416 --> 02:26:47,618
LIAM: Thank you.

1961
02:26:47,618 --> 02:26:53,499
MATT: But the blade hits and pokes just enough
where you know that's maybe-- That's where the

1962
02:26:53,499 --> 02:26:54,629
kidney is.

1963
02:26:54,629 --> 02:26:56,067
WILL: Right, okay.

1964
02:26:56,067 --> 02:26:59,250
MATT: And in that brief moment, you see the little
creeping smile up the side of his mouth. You go

1965
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:01,665
ahead and roll your attack now, Kashaw.

1966
02:27:01,665 --> 02:27:03,099
WILL: 18.

1967
02:27:03,099 --> 02:27:04,508
MATT: Plus?

1968
02:27:04,508 --> 02:27:09,503
WILL: Plus, well, if I'm using my-- I don't want
to use the shadow spear. Should we use-- Let's not

1969
02:27:09,503 --> 02:27:15,055
do nec damage on him, let's think. It's just a
regular plus two, right?

1970
02:27:15,055 --> 02:27:16,971
LIAM: So what is he at?

1971
02:27:16,971 --> 02:27:18,250
MATT: 20.

1972
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,724
LIAM: Nope.

1973
02:27:19,724 --> 02:27:22,306
MATT: Well, it's a plus two spear. What's your
attack bonus altogether?

1974
02:27:22,306 --> 02:27:24,476
WILL: Oh, with the attack bonus is plus ten.

1975
02:27:24,476 --> 02:27:26,371
MATT: So that's 28.

1976
02:27:26,371 --> 02:27:27,940
WILL: 28 to you, yeah.

1977
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:29,369
LIAM: Oh, that definitely hits.

1978
02:27:29,369 --> 02:27:32,950
MATT: Yeah, so, after you get the blade there,
there's that moment of posturing. How do you

1979
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:34,429
deflect him off?

1980
02:27:34,429 --> 02:27:39,847
WILL: I think, yeah, the blade comes in, he's got
his spear, so as the blade comes in, he slaps his

1981
02:27:39,847 --> 02:27:46,952
arm away and just takes it right lightly across
the chest so it just cuts into the little bit of fat.

1982
02:27:46,952 --> 02:27:51,849
MATT: Just-- (slicing noise). You back away and
you see two of the mantle-like dark feathers of

1983
02:27:51,849 --> 02:27:54,560
your armor, the very tips just go-- (puff)

1984
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:56,943
WILL: And then I look at you and go: one-one.

1985
02:27:56,943 --> 02:27:59,139
(laughter)

1986
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:02,961
MARY: I cast Eldritch Blast, two beams, right in
front of either one of them.

1987
02:28:02,961 --> 02:28:09,080
MATT: As you guys are having this moment, all of a
sudden the ground detonates before you. In a haze

1988
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:16,562
of greenish-white arcane energy, you see now these
small basketball-sized concave blast craters in

1989
02:28:16,562 --> 02:28:20,599
the ground before each of you, and right off to
the side you see Zahra standing, staff in one

1990
02:28:20,599 --> 02:28:23,813
hand, hand before her with the other.

1991
02:28:23,813 --> 02:28:27,104
LIAM: Oh, you do have two different color eyes.
They're so nice.

1992
02:28:27,104 --> 02:28:29,969
MARY: I use Thaumaturgy to go fire with my eyes.

1993
02:28:29,969 --> 02:28:31,709
WILL: We're just playing.

1994
02:28:31,709 --> 02:28:35,024
MARY: All right, boys. Enough. I appreciate it.

1995
02:28:35,024 --> 02:28:37,480
LIAM: All right, we'll play slap and tickle
later.

1996
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:43,267
MARY: Your fun is wrong. Play slap-tickle later.
Let's do this.

1997
02:28:43,267 --> 02:28:47,240
LIAM: Anyway, sword works. Sure.

1998
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:56,159
MATT: All right, you sheath the sword. So you guys
gather the rest of your materials together.

1999
02:28:56,159 --> 02:29:06,211
TALIESIN: We still have that spare sword that was
just that standard rapier that was just in the bag

2000
02:29:06,211 --> 02:29:08,776
before from the general, correct?

2001
02:29:08,776 --> 02:29:11,864
LAURA: Grog has the Bag of Holding, and I don't
know what's in it.

2002
02:29:11,864 --> 02:29:16,862
TALIESIN: I think we have it. We still have just a
very standard nothing, where it's barely a plus one--

2003
02:29:16,862 --> 02:29:19,494
MATT: Yeah, it's barely enchanted.

2004
02:29:19,494 --> 02:29:20,841
LIAM: What'd you need it for?

2005
02:29:20,841 --> 02:29:23,826
TALIESIN: Just in case someone gets close enough
to me that it's complicated.

2006
02:29:23,826 --> 02:29:25,619
LIAM: I have a shortsword, but that sounds
better.

2007
02:29:25,619 --> 02:29:29,011
TALIESIN: It's probably better. It's whatever
Stonefell had.

2008
02:29:29,011 --> 02:29:33,595
MATT: Shortsword is dex-based, so you're going to
probably want to run with that.

2009
02:29:33,595 --> 02:29:40,903
MARISHA: I need to roll really fast to recharge my
Spire. So I'm going to do that, real fast.

2010
02:29:40,903 --> 02:29:43,922
MATT: All right. And actually, you should roll to
recharge your wand.

2011
02:29:43,922 --> 02:29:45,789
MARISHA: It goes all the way up. It is full
again.

2012
02:29:45,789 --> 02:29:47,266
MATT: All right.

2013
02:29:47,266 --> 02:29:52,436
MARISHA: I rolled four plus four.

2014
02:29:52,436 --> 02:29:55,309
MATT: Twice, actually, for two nights of rest,
so.

2015
02:29:55,309 --> 02:29:56,673
WILL: "My spire's full."

2016
02:29:56,673 --> 02:29:58,129
MARY: "So is mine."

2017
02:29:58,129 --> 02:30:00,449
SAM: Seven. So I'm back up to normal.

2018
02:30:00,449 --> 02:30:11,135
MATT: Okay. All righty. As you guys are preparing,
Gilmore comes out. He's usually dressed in his

2019
02:30:11,135 --> 02:30:20,565
usual casual flowing robes. Or his wizard
tracksuit-type outfit. The outfit you see on him,

2020
02:30:20,565 --> 02:30:27,541
it's more ornamental. And it's, specifically more
so than you've seen him wear, it has a very

2021
02:30:27,541 --> 02:30:35,557
similar design and presentation of some of the
more noble individuals you saw wandering Marquet,

2022
02:30:35,557 --> 02:30:42,296
Ank'Harel in particular. He seems to be going more
ceremonial than you're used to seeing Gilmore.

2023
02:30:42,296 --> 02:30:44,341
LAURA: What color are the robes?

2024
02:30:44,341 --> 02:30:50,073
MATT: Oh, they are very much purple and gold. He
keeps to his aesthetic. But the design is

2025
02:30:50,073 --> 02:30:52,885
definitely ceremonial; different than anything
you've seen him wear.

2026
02:30:52,885 --> 02:30:54,163
MARISHA: Wow.

2027
02:30:54,163 --> 02:30:55,784
LIAM: Full Bollywood.

2028
02:30:55,784 --> 02:30:57,988
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was thinking about!

2029
02:30:57,988 --> 02:31:00,881
SAM: Is it his old boy scout uniform or what?

2030
02:31:00,881 --> 02:31:06,754
MATT: It's a long mantle that travels down to the
lower part of his torso, where his arms come out

2031
02:31:06,754 --> 02:31:12,411
from these long sleeves that come to a fine point
at the ends. He still has all of his jewelry on,

2032
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:15,933
but where the belt is you can see it's a very
thick, heavy belt that like ties to a bow in the

2033
02:31:15,933 --> 02:31:22,941
center, almost like a reverse kimono that comes to
a square point. And the robe itself drops low and

2034
02:31:22,941 --> 02:31:30,356
flows behind him as he walks. It's really pretty.
As he walks in, he's holding himself with the

2035
02:31:30,356 --> 02:31:36,789
Gilmore air, but you can still see a bead of sweat
down his head and a little bit of nervous energy.

2036
02:31:36,789 --> 02:31:40,095
"Very well, I guess today's the day."

2037
02:31:40,095 --> 02:31:42,290
TALIESIN: Be pleased.

2038
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:43,761
SAM: How are we going to get there?

2039
02:31:43,761 --> 02:31:45,808
MATT: "Be pleased."

2040
02:31:45,808 --> 02:31:47,668
WILL: Are we speaking to the general first?

2041
02:31:47,668 --> 02:31:53,595
SAM: Yeah, we're going there first. But not via a
tree, we have to go via something else.

2042
02:31:53,595 --> 02:31:55,423
LAURA: Why not via a tree?

2043
02:31:55,423 --> 02:31:57,231
SAM: Is there a tree on the battlefield where they
are?

2044
02:31:57,231 --> 02:31:58,901
LAURA: Well, it's not a battlefield.

2045
02:31:58,901 --> 02:32:05,546
MARISHA: I will be able to find out when we scry.
If not, we'll have to talk to Allura. I'm going to

2046
02:32:05,546 --> 02:32:09,113
scry real quick! Scrying Eye.

2047
02:32:09,113 --> 02:32:10,370
MATT: Who are you scrying on?

2048
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:16,067
MARISHA: Can't hide from my scrying eyes. Your
dad. What's his name? Syldor, okay.

2049
02:32:16,067 --> 02:32:21,360
TALIESIN: Syldor the inevitably disappointed.
That's his full title.

2050
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:38,297
MATT: Okay, you scry Syldor. You have a bit of a
flash of green, lots of green, endless green. Your

2051
02:32:38,297 --> 02:32:50,078
vision jumps into a familiar warm home. You see
Syldor nervously sitting with his daughter on his

2052
02:32:50,078 --> 02:32:58,581
knee, and they're talking. Syldor is back in
Syngorn. Syldor isn't a fighter, Syldor is a

2053
02:32:58,581 --> 02:32:59,828
diplomat.

2054
02:32:59,828 --> 02:33:01,434
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

2055
02:33:01,434 --> 02:33:04,412
LAURA: Right, right.

2056
02:33:04,412 --> 02:33:06,260
WILL: Did you see them? Where are they?

2057
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:11,162
MARISHA: Happy and healthy and comfortable by a
fire.

2058
02:33:11,162 --> 02:33:13,750
WILL: The whole army is happy and healthy and
comfortable by a fire?!

2059
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:19,372
MARISHA: No, he's not with the army is what I
mean. Oh shit. I thought he was going to be with

2060
02:33:19,372 --> 02:33:20,637
the army.

2061
02:33:20,637 --> 02:33:22,751
TALIESIN: It's okay we have plan B. Let's go deal
with plan B.

2062
02:33:22,751 --> 02:33:24,849
MARISHA: Okay, I'll scry again.

2063
02:33:24,849 --> 02:33:28,175
TALIESIN: Or we can make Allura do it.

2064
02:33:28,175 --> 02:33:32,957
MARISHA: Allura, do you know where they are?

2065
02:33:32,957 --> 02:33:35,208
LAURA: She can take us to Daxio?

2066
02:33:35,208 --> 02:33:47,564
MATT: "I don't know specifically where they are."
And she sits for a second and sets up a rush job

2067
02:33:47,564 --> 02:33:50,949
of a scry ritual, 'cause now she feels she's been
put on the spot. But she puts it together.

2068
02:33:50,949 --> 02:33:52,698
MARISHA: Can I help her a little bit?

2069
02:33:52,698 --> 02:33:56,088
MATT: Yeah, you give her a little aid. You pay it
back to the last time you helped her with a scry

2070
02:33:56,088 --> 02:34:03,258
spell, back when you first met in Emon. And her
eyes blink over white again, cloudy. And she

2071
02:34:03,258 --> 02:34:15,461
returns. "All right, I see Mikael and the army
gathered, and there is a very energetic air to

2072
02:34:15,461 --> 02:34:19,845
"them. They're looking restless. I can bring eight
of you with me."

2073
02:34:19,845 --> 02:34:26,577
SAM: Well, are there any trees near them?

2074
02:34:26,577 --> 02:34:28,336
MATT: "There are, yeah."

2075
02:34:28,336 --> 02:34:34,747
MARISHA: The problem is it generally has to be a
tree that I'm familiar with.

2076
02:34:34,747 --> 02:34:38,656
SAM: If you go with her, you'll be familiar with
the tree.

2077
02:34:38,656 --> 02:34:41,538
MARISHA: It doesn't work that way.

2078
02:34:41,538 --> 02:34:47,406
LAURA: Question, if you go and you open up a path
to the Sun Tree, can people on this side run

2079
02:34:47,406 --> 02:34:49,245
through the Sun Tree?

2080
02:34:49,245 --> 02:34:52,529
MARISHA: Can I? That's an excellent question, can
I?

2081
02:34:52,529 --> 02:34:57,052
MATT: Wait, so if you Transport via Plants--

2082
02:34:57,052 --> 02:35:01,293
MARISHA: Like if I go with Allura and then open a
gate through the Sun Tree, and they're just ready

2083
02:35:01,293 --> 02:35:02,656
to rock.

2084
02:35:02,656 --> 02:35:05,043
TALIESIN: Do you have a Sling Ring?

2085
02:35:05,043 --> 02:35:07,758
MARISHA: Oh, damn it. Fucking lost my Sling Ring.

2086
02:35:07,758 --> 02:35:09,566
MATT: It does; it connects the plants on both
sides.

2087
02:35:09,566 --> 02:35:11,334
(cheering)

2088
02:35:11,334 --> 02:35:15,672
MARISHA: Hey! I'll do that. Does anyone else want
to go, just in case?

2089
02:35:15,672 --> 02:35:19,846
LAURA: Yeah, the eight of us need to go. And then
how many is that left?

2090
02:35:19,846 --> 02:35:22,293
MATT: "That would leave--"

2091
02:35:22,293 --> 02:35:24,558
SAM: Four?

2092
02:35:24,558 --> 02:35:32,719
MATT: "Then Grog, Pike and Gilmore. And Kima. And
Jarett. Yeah, we could bring everybody."

2093
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:33,918
LAURA: And Drake?

2094
02:35:33,918 --> 02:35:38,815
MATT: "Is Drake coming?" And she looks off to the
side, and you see this little figure running down

2095
02:35:38,815 --> 02:35:45,110
from the castle at the top, carrying all this shit
in his arms. "Hold on! I'm--" And you watch him

2096
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:53,633
just eat shit. He just tumbles; scatters. Gets up
and is like, "No one saw that!" Picks it back up,

2097
02:35:53,633 --> 02:35:56,104
runs back down and catches up.

2098
02:35:56,104 --> 02:36:02,977
TALIESIN: Are we supposed to get something from
the-- Oh god, we were supposed to-- Weren't we

2099
02:36:02,977 --> 02:36:05,427
supposed to grab something earlier? My brain is
just turning to mush.

2100
02:36:05,427 --> 02:36:06,475
SAM: We got it already.

2101
02:36:06,475 --> 02:36:07,817
TALIESIN: Oh, we got it already; never mind,
that's right.

2102
02:36:07,817 --> 02:36:09,385
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He gave it to us.

2103
02:36:09,385 --> 02:36:12,473
MARISHA: Where's Raishan, though?

2104
02:36:12,473 --> 02:36:14,896
LIAM: Yeah. Are we going to talk to
what's-her-butt?

2105
02:36:14,896 --> 02:36:20,328
SAM: She'll find us. She's not our problem. She's
not our problem. We're not babysitting a dragon.

2106
02:36:20,328 --> 02:36:23,387
TALIESIN: In fact, if anything, the less we speak
to her at this point, probably the better.

2107
02:36:23,387 --> 02:36:25,309
WILL: And you're sure she's coming?

2108
02:36:25,309 --> 02:36:30,190
MATT: "Don't worry; she's coming." And you hear
another dwarven voice from the side, as you glance

2109
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:34,189
out you see there's standing not too far from you,
arms crossed, Larkin.

2110
02:36:34,189 --> 02:36:36,957
(cheering)

2111
02:36:36,957 --> 02:36:41,555
LIAM: Buddy! Where have you been!? I've been
fucking worried sick! You were there; you were

2112
02:36:41,555 --> 02:36:43,134
gone. How'd you even get back here?

2113
02:36:43,134 --> 02:36:44,725
MARISHA: Vax, please, don't--

2114
02:36:44,725 --> 02:36:53,485
LIAM: Listen, I'm fucking with you. All right?
What's up, green bean?

2115
02:36:53,485 --> 02:36:58,336
MATT: "So, are we ready for this?"

2116
02:36:58,336 --> 02:36:59,830
TALIESIN: No.

2117
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:02,613
MATT: "Didn't think so. Let's do it."

2118
02:37:02,613 --> 02:37:08,778
SAM: So you all go; I'll stay with these ragtag
group and sit by the tree and get ready.

2119
02:37:08,778 --> 02:37:10,393
LAURA and MARISHA: All right.

2120
02:37:10,393 --> 02:37:17,369
MATT: Allura grabs you, and takes Kima, and the
rest of the group that she can, and over time you

2121
02:37:17,369 --> 02:37:22,039
guys manage to get-- we'll say for the sake of
brevity here-- everyone back over to the war camp

2122
02:37:22,039 --> 02:37:26,856
itself. And it is a fair-sized war camp. And
what's interesting is as you're within this camp,

2123
02:37:26,856 --> 02:37:32,341
you look up, and in a similar way, the illusion
barrier that surrounds Whitestone, that very, very

2124
02:37:32,341 --> 02:37:41,588
faint shimmering effect, is present, but it's much
stronger and it's much more visceral in the way

2125
02:37:41,588 --> 02:37:45,005
that it alters the visuals. It looks like the sky
is this perpetual shifting kaleidoscope of colors.

2126
02:37:45,005 --> 02:37:49,635
The blue sky becomes green, becomes purple,
becomes red; it just constantly shifts like the

2127
02:37:49,635 --> 02:37:52,722
surface of a pond that's been perpetually
rippling.

2128
02:37:52,722 --> 02:37:59,280
And you see on the outskirts of the war camp, this
rotating guard of illusionists that are taking

2129
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:06,548
time to just restore and maintain this illusion,
as everyone else is eating, polishing their

2130
02:38:06,548 --> 02:38:17,772
weapons and armor. You see a mix of elven
warriors, elven archers, and, very similar to the

2131
02:38:17,772 --> 02:38:22,429
Daxio soldiers you met earlier, but armor of
different crests, signifying the different

2132
02:38:22,429 --> 02:38:23,875
regiments.

2133
02:38:23,875 --> 02:38:30,877
It doesn't take you too long to eventually come
upon, and be led to, the tent where Mikael is, the

2134
02:38:30,877 --> 02:38:35,813
Warmaster himself. The Warmaster, I do not believe
you've met before, personally.

2135
02:38:35,813 --> 02:38:43,879
As you enter and look within, you can see the
Warmaster-- It sets you off at first, because he

2136
02:38:43,879 --> 02:38:51,851
does resemble his son. His son, who you did not
have quite a positive experience with. He's an

2137
02:38:51,851 --> 02:38:57,881
older elvish man. His hair just past
shoulder-length, but pulled into a very, very

2138
02:38:57,881 --> 02:39:05,777
tight ponytail in the back, with a few strands
that fall in front of his face. He has a very,

2139
02:39:05,777 --> 02:39:14,266
very strong jaw for an elf. He's a thick and
well-built warrior and holds that with both a

2140
02:39:14,266 --> 02:39:20,281
strength, and commanding respect, and everyone
around him definitely looks up to him. You can

2141
02:39:20,281 --> 02:39:24,937
immediately see why he's the Warmaster and how
he's held that position for so long. And you also

2142
02:39:24,937 --> 02:39:30,291
wonder, one, how his son fell so hard, and two,
how it must have affected him.

2143
02:39:30,291 --> 02:39:35,561
But in that instant as you enter, he's in the
process of having a conversation, and they have a

2144
02:39:35,561 --> 02:39:42,433
layout of what looks to be a brief sketch of Emon
in its current state, with a few things here and

2145
02:39:42,433 --> 02:39:50,361
there marking where most of the gathered elements
of the army, whatever you'd call it, the defense

2146
02:39:50,361 --> 02:39:59,342
of Emon, exists. And as you all begin to enter the
tent, he goes, "Oh, hello. I know of you, and I've

2147
02:39:59,342 --> 02:40:10,578
"been expecting you. Allura has been kind enough to
fill me in, in bits and pieces, but as far as I am

2148
02:40:10,578 --> 02:40:14,379
"to understand, you're our strike force?"

2149
02:40:14,379 --> 02:40:18,199
LAURA: The elite SWAT team, heading in there.

2150
02:40:18,199 --> 02:40:24,233
MATT: "Good to know this. We've been walking for
quite some time, and the soldiers have had a bit

2151
02:40:24,233 --> 02:40:30,941
"of rest. If we could, we would take an additional
day, just to put it at our most capable, but it

2152
02:40:30,941 --> 02:40:39,985
"seems time is not at our beck and call in this
situation, and as such, when the sun is down, I

2153
02:40:39,985 --> 02:40:43,445
"think that is the agreed-upon time to strike."

2154
02:40:43,445 --> 02:40:47,385
SAM: At sundown. All right, sure. Yeah, yeah,
sure.

2155
02:40:47,385 --> 02:40:51,761
TALIESIN: Most of these soldiers have, at least,
night vision, some form of darkvision, I assume.

2156
02:40:51,761 --> 02:40:57,920
MATT: "Most of the Syngorian army does, and we
have quite a few at Daxio that do as well."

2157
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:00,598
WILL: (flatly) How are you going to attack?

2158
02:41:00,598 --> 02:41:04,543
LAURA: This is Kashaw.

2159
02:41:04,543 --> 02:41:06,613
WILL: Hi. How are you going to attack?

2160
02:41:06,613 --> 02:41:15,152
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you as well. So. We have
broken up the regiments into five different

2161
02:41:15,152 --> 02:41:19,984
"segments. We're going to separate, leading into
the initial strike. We're going to simultaneously

2162
02:41:19,984 --> 02:41:26,004
"hit the four main gates, the north, south, east,
and west side. The easternmost gate has already

2163
02:41:26,004 --> 02:41:30,396
"received quite a bit of damage. With all the
simultaneous strikes, we're hoping to draw most of

2164
02:41:30,396 --> 02:41:35,338
"the army to the outer circles of the city. We're
going to utilize this time to then shift our

2165
02:41:35,338 --> 02:41:39,874
"forces southward and instead push towards a
singular gate in a southward position, while

2166
02:41:39,874 --> 02:41:45,637
"they're scattered in that direction. If I'm to
understand what Allura has told me, you are going

2167
02:41:45,637 --> 02:41:48,532
"to be entering from underneath the city?"

2168
02:41:48,532 --> 02:41:50,089
TALIESIN: That is the plan.

2169
02:41:50,089 --> 02:41:56,180
MATT: "And attempting to facilitate the opening of
one or more of these gates in doing so?"

2170
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:58,742
LAURA: That would be swell if we can, huh?

2171
02:41:58,742 --> 02:42:00,234
MATT: "That would be."

2172
02:42:00,234 --> 02:42:02,590
TALIESIN: We haven't really discussed it, but--

2173
02:42:02,590 --> 02:42:04,494
LAURA: No, no, no, but we have talked about doing
it.

2174
02:42:04,494 --> 02:42:09,483
TALIESIN: Or even breaching the south gate alone
would be-- If all four gates are being--

2175
02:42:09,483 --> 02:42:13,213
WILL: Any time we go out and we attack a gate,
they're going to bring all of their forces to that

2176
02:42:13,213 --> 02:42:18,515
gate. What they're not going to be suspecting is a
wall being ripped down. And once you open a wall,

2177
02:42:18,515 --> 02:42:20,353
you can't close it. You can close a gate.

2178
02:42:20,353 --> 02:42:22,805
LAURA: What's the weakest wall?

2179
02:42:22,805 --> 02:42:24,817
MATT: "That would be the eastern wall."

2180
02:42:24,817 --> 02:42:26,206
TALIESIN: It's also near Greyskull Keep.

2181
02:42:26,206 --> 02:42:28,506
MARY: Oh, that's the arrow that you're going to
use, yes.

2182
02:42:28,506 --> 02:42:35,866
MATT: "While we are not in a position to use siege
weaponry, we do have most of our mages at our

2183
02:42:35,866 --> 02:42:44,975
"disposal, and they have prepared a modicum of
siege-based arcane spells at their disposal. So I

2184
02:42:44,975 --> 02:42:50,758
"do not think piercing the outer wall will be an
issue. It's what lies beyond it that our focus is

2185
02:42:50,758 --> 02:42:57,254
"going to be: sow confusion, separate and destroy.
They are not a very well-organized army, and most

2186
02:42:57,254 --> 02:43:02,384
"of the creatures we've seen wandering the skies do
so with nothing but bloodlust and the intent to

2187
02:43:02,384 --> 02:43:11,790
"rend and tear as their main driving force and
goal. So, utilizing that technique-- And we've

2188
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:16,238
"discussed, you'll be entering the walls; we'll be
pushing forward, phalanx method with those that

2189
02:43:16,238 --> 02:43:21,180
"are shielded. We will be piercing through and
scattering from the inside, breaking their ranks

2190
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:26,550
"as much as possible, and doing our best to stay
out of the skies, using alleyways, using small

2191
02:43:26,550 --> 02:43:31,476
"streets. We don't want our men being plucked out
from the middle, from their air support."

2192
02:43:31,476 --> 02:43:33,536
LAURA: We will have air support.

2193
02:43:33,536 --> 02:43:39,823
MARISHA: I called in assistance from the Air
Ashari, from the north. They're maintaining the skies.

2194
02:43:39,823 --> 02:43:42,071
MATT: "The Ashari are aiding us as well?"

2195
02:43:42,071 --> 02:43:43,578
WILL: Do you know how many?

2196
02:43:43,578 --> 02:43:45,690
MARISHA: Did dad tell me how many?

2197
02:43:45,690 --> 02:43:47,171
MATT: He said roughly a hundred.

2198
02:43:47,171 --> 02:43:50,918
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Thanks, dad. Roughly a
hundred.

2199
02:43:50,918 --> 02:43:58,235
WILL: If I can make a suggestion? If you get into
the city, don't move through the alleys. You're

2200
02:43:58,235 --> 02:44:02,988
going to scatter your forces. Move into the city
and fortify a position. So then you've opened a

2201
02:44:02,988 --> 02:44:07,446
gate inside the city. Move the command center
inside the city, and defend from there.

2202
02:44:07,446 --> 02:44:17,258
MATT: "That is indeed part of our push, however,
we are rather vulnerable from the air. So with the

2203
02:44:17,258 --> 02:44:21,545
"Air Ashari giving us air support, that will allow
us the ability that we need to push forward as a

2204
02:44:21,545 --> 02:44:29,018
"singular unit, from unit to unit, in its own
right. You are entering from where?"

2205
02:44:29,018 --> 02:44:31,348
SAM: The sewers.

2206
02:44:31,348 --> 02:44:39,031
LAURA: Yes. We have a secret entrance in our keep,
if we can still access it. If not, there is an

2207
02:44:39,031 --> 02:44:49,056
entrance to the sewers towards the water. We were
told of it by the Clasp, right?

2208
02:44:49,056 --> 02:44:52,365
SAM: I've also used a tunnel to get out, at some
point.

2209
02:44:52,365 --> 02:44:54,521
MARISHA: That's right, when you were looking for
Kaylie.

2210
02:44:54,521 --> 02:44:56,036
MATT: That was Westruun.

2211
02:44:56,036 --> 02:44:58,292
SAM: It's the same sewer system, though, right?

2212
02:44:58,292 --> 02:45:01,908
MARY: It's the same basic layout of a city, yeah,
right?

2213
02:45:01,908 --> 02:45:06,040
LAURA: Wait, wait, the Traverse Junction. What's
the Traverse Junction?

2214
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:16,594
MATT: "The Traverse Junction is-- was-- is, as far
as I know, still attached to the Lyceum, but--"

2215
02:45:16,594 --> 02:45:18,596
SAM: The Lyceum's unguarded!

2216
02:45:18,596 --> 02:45:22,552
MATT: "The Lyceum is partially destroyed, and is
filled with the remains of the enemy."

2217
02:45:22,552 --> 02:45:24,243
SAM: I remember that.

2218
02:45:24,243 --> 02:45:29,203
LAURA: That's not what I meant, then. That wasn't
the thing that I meant to say.

2219
02:45:29,203 --> 02:45:33,771
MARISHA: And we know Thordak has made an
underground basin. He only emerges when someone

2220
02:45:33,771 --> 02:45:35,847
challenges him, or offers their loyalty.

2221
02:45:35,847 --> 02:45:38,323
MARY: Were we supposed to meet the Clasp in a
specific place?

2222
02:45:38,323 --> 02:45:40,599
SAM: We've just got to get to a sewer.

2223
02:45:40,599 --> 02:45:45,492
MARY: So we just need to find a sewer and then
we're going to reconnoiter with-- Is that the

2224
02:45:45,492 --> 02:45:49,539
right word? Anyway-- with the Clasp. And at that
point, we shall make our way through--

2225
02:45:49,539 --> 02:45:51,022
MATT: All right.

2226
02:45:51,022 --> 02:45:53,561
WILL: And that's when the thieves and liars will
take us to the thing that's going to kill us all?

2227
02:45:53,561 --> 02:45:56,220
We're very excited about the plan.

2228
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:57,538
MATT: "I can tell."

2229
02:45:57,538 --> 02:46:03,128
WILL: Yeah. Do we have the 50 soldiers we need, or
do we need to ask them for 50?

2230
02:46:03,128 --> 02:46:05,936
SAM: Did they ever show up? Did the 50 soldiers
from Fort Daxio show up?

2231
02:46:05,936 --> 02:46:11,448
MATT: "I had heard that Daxio had fallen. There
are survivors?"

2232
02:46:11,448 --> 02:46:13,751
LAURA: Well. There were. There were about 55
soldiers.

2233
02:46:13,751 --> 02:46:15,981
MATT: "They haven't found their way to us yet,
then. We'll keep an eye out."

2234
02:46:15,981 --> 02:46:18,979
TALIESIN: They might be headed towards Greyskull,
if I recall. I believe they were heading there.

2235
02:46:18,979 --> 02:46:22,543
LAURA: That's true. They should be crossing paths
very shortly.

2236
02:46:22,543 --> 02:46:26,853
TALIESIN: 50 men can move quietly.

2237
02:46:26,853 --> 02:46:31,939
LAURA: So after you cut through all of the
lizardmen like butter, you'll make your way to

2238
02:46:31,939 --> 02:46:33,219
Thordak?

2239
02:46:33,219 --> 02:46:39,381
MATT: "That's the intent, to push in towards the
Cloudtop. And, based on how well you and/or any of

2240
02:46:39,381 --> 02:46:44,493
"the air forces have been able to puncture the
defenses, push in towards the creature itself and

2241
02:46:44,493 --> 02:46:50,498
"unleash everything we have at the beast. As far as
I know and have been told, from some of the

2242
02:46:50,498 --> 02:46:57,037
"remaining members of the Council, they have a few
members still within the city. I believe Tofor

2243
02:46:57,037 --> 02:47:03,583
"Brotoras, Seeker Asum, and Brom Goldhand are still
within the city."

2244
02:47:03,583 --> 02:47:07,552
SAM: Well, not Asum. We know where he is.

2245
02:47:07,552 --> 02:47:09,874
LAURA: And Brom.

2246
02:47:09,874 --> 02:47:12,365
MARY: I thought Brom was at Whitestone.

2247
02:47:12,365 --> 02:47:14,441
LAURA: Don't say that word out loud.

2248
02:47:14,441 --> 02:47:16,936
MARY: I said it to you, quietly.

2249
02:47:16,936 --> 02:47:19,550
LAURA: Yeah, very quietly.

2250
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:25,432
TALIESIN: We'll gather what we can. We don't
really know what's actually in there, yet.

2251
02:47:25,432 --> 02:47:27,796
MARISHA: And we can't trust anyone within the city
limits.

2252
02:47:27,796 --> 02:47:29,326
MATT: "Understood."

2253
02:47:29,326 --> 02:47:31,744
WILL: Do you have a time frame? For your attack?

2254
02:47:31,744 --> 02:47:38,095
MATT: "We are intending, once the men have been
fed, once the men have been able to rest and

2255
02:47:38,095 --> 02:47:40,870
"prepare their armaments, we were going to attack
upon sundown, yes."

2256
02:47:40,870 --> 02:47:42,783
WILL: And you plan to breach the city when?

2257
02:47:42,783 --> 02:47:45,480
MATT: "Hopefully within the first hour of the
attack."

2258
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:47,562
WILL: Really?

2259
02:47:47,562 --> 02:47:49,167
MATT: "That's the intent."

2260
02:47:49,167 --> 02:47:54,343
WILL: How far do you think we can make it in the
tunnels in an hour?

2261
02:47:54,343 --> 02:47:59,579
TALIESIN: Pretty far, to be honest, especially if
we're-- Well, no that's--

2262
02:47:59,579 --> 02:48:00,987
SAM: 20 blocks.

2263
02:48:00,987 --> 02:48:02,647
WILL: You making that number up?

2264
02:48:02,647 --> 02:48:03,582
SAM: Yep.

2265
02:48:03,582 --> 02:48:04,630
WILL: You just pulled that out of nowhere.

2266
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:05,636
SAM: Absolutely.

2267
02:48:05,636 --> 02:48:09,647
TALIESIN: It's the highest number he knows. Grog's
not here; I have to do something.

2268
02:48:09,647 --> 02:48:14,155
SAM: An hour-- We can probably make it, I don't
know, we can make it deep into the city, but not

2269
02:48:14,155 --> 02:48:15,939
all the way to the center, can we?

2270
02:48:15,939 --> 02:48:17,405
TALIESIN: No, not in an hour.

2271
02:48:17,405 --> 02:48:22,386
LIAM: It's a maze in there. But the tunnel from
our keep in, if it's intact, was not that far.

2272
02:48:22,386 --> 02:48:29,100
MATT: "If you were to traverse the tunnel system
in advance of our attack, that would perhaps aid

2273
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:31,614
"us in syncing our maneuvers."

2274
02:48:31,614 --> 02:48:33,257
SAM: So we should go now.

2275
02:48:33,257 --> 02:48:38,339
WILL: That would be the goal, is to act as point
for the entire army.

2276
02:48:38,339 --> 02:48:40,634
MATT: "That would indeed be the goal."

2277
02:48:40,634 --> 02:48:43,321
LAURA: So, what, the minute we pop out, we send up
a flare?

2278
02:48:43,321 --> 02:48:49,287
MATT: "Some sort of a sign. Hopefully something
not quite as easy to read as a sign of aggression.

2279
02:48:49,287 --> 02:48:52,294
"We've taken much care to not be seen this far."

2280
02:48:52,294 --> 02:48:57,239
SAM: Or we could just wait for sundown and then
go, knowing that they're going to strike at the

2281
02:48:57,239 --> 02:48:58,212
same time.

2282
02:48:58,212 --> 02:48:59,521
TALIESIN: We go now.

2283
02:48:59,521 --> 02:49:04,354
SAM: No, I mean, once we get in there, we wait
until we pop out, until it's getting dark

2284
02:49:04,354 --> 02:49:05,437
outside.

2285
02:49:05,437 --> 02:49:09,021
LIAM: I mean, what kind of symbol do we send up in
a sky full of wyverns?

2286
02:49:09,021 --> 02:49:11,423
LAURA: What if we're not in position by sundown?

2287
02:49:11,423 --> 02:49:16,046
MARISHA: The Ashari are already looking for a
symbol. I plan to be aiding them. They should be

2288
02:49:16,046 --> 02:49:18,096
helping us with--

2289
02:49:18,096 --> 02:49:19,501
SAM: What about a storm?

2290
02:49:19,501 --> 02:49:21,360
MARISHA: Well, there will be a storm.

2291
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:22,931
WILL: Wait, there's a storm coming?

2292
02:49:22,931 --> 02:49:24,197
SAM: Can <i>you</i> make one?

2293
02:49:24,197 --> 02:49:29,888
MATT: As you guys actually glance over, you can
see in the eastern sky, past the Iron Seat

2294
02:49:29,888 --> 02:49:39,431
Ridge, there is an extremely dark, building
stormfront that is just looming, miles off in the

2295
02:49:39,431 --> 02:49:40,742
distance.

2296
02:49:40,742 --> 02:49:42,071
MARISHA: See? Told you.

2297
02:49:42,071 --> 02:49:47,317
SAM: What about-- Kiki, what if you just made some
lightning strikes to signal the start of the fight?

2298
02:49:47,317 --> 02:49:49,440
TALIESIN: I think nature itself is going to make
some lightning strikes.

2299
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:54,384
MARISHA: Well, I've got my whole Skywrite thing.
I've got my whole Skywrite thing; I can make a

2300
02:49:54,384 --> 02:50:01,280
symbol in the air out of clouds, which isn't as
terrifying as everyone has thought it is in the

2301
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:05,199
past. We just need to pick a symbol--

2302
02:50:05,199 --> 02:50:07,643
LAURA: It just has to be subtle, something your
dad will recognize, huh?

2303
02:50:07,643 --> 02:50:09,353
MARY: A phoenix or something.

2304
02:50:09,353 --> 02:50:12,407
WILL: How is the storm going to affect your
attack, is my question.

2305
02:50:12,407 --> 02:50:19,998
MATT: "We are trained to undergo warfare in many
different forms of terrain and weather."

2306
02:50:19,998 --> 02:50:24,525
MARY: My concern is that if we wait until this
storm comes in, the sewers will be flooded. We

2307
02:50:24,525 --> 02:50:26,542
need to go in now before the storm gets here.

2308
02:50:26,542 --> 02:50:29,737
WILL: But if we get lost in there and the storm
comes, it'll be flooded while we're in there.

2309
02:50:29,737 --> 02:50:31,710
SAM: The storm isn't a real storm, isn't it Air
Ashari?

2310
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:34,083
LAURA: No, no, no, it's Air Ashari.

2311
02:50:34,083 --> 02:50:36,702
TALIESIN: But it's still a real storm.

2312
02:50:36,702 --> 02:50:40,790
MATT: "If there is rain to come with the storm,
that is fortuitous, for much of the city still

2313
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:45,608
"burns. But fire we can quell with a storm would be
helpful."

2314
02:50:45,608 --> 02:50:48,555
MARISHA: It's a-coming man. It's coming.

2315
02:50:48,555 --> 02:50:50,267
MATT: "Right, good to know this."

2316
02:50:50,267 --> 02:50:52,192
LIAM: Well, let's go.

2317
02:50:52,192 --> 02:50:54,541
SAM: To Greyskull Keep?

2318
02:50:54,541 --> 02:50:59,276
MARISHA: Look for-- Keep your eye on the sky.

2319
02:50:59,276 --> 02:51:04,427
MATT: "I will have two of my hawkeyes keeping an
eye at the clouds"

2320
02:51:04,427 --> 02:51:14,849
MARISHA: There will be a symbol. It will be super
obvious when it's determined. You'll be like, "Oh,

2321
02:51:14,849 --> 02:51:20,099
"of course, it couldn't have been anything else".
When you see it.

2322
02:51:20,099 --> 02:51:25,175
MATT: "I look forward to solving your riddle. You
as well, stay safe."

2323
02:51:25,175 --> 02:51:29,457
MARISHA: Don't know what the fuck it's going to
be. It could be a big "VM" for Vox Machina, I mean

2324
02:51:29,457 --> 02:51:34,129
like you know-- We could be like, Now! Fucking
attack!

2325
02:51:34,129 --> 02:51:39,498
LIAM: Are there clouds overhead now? Above the
city.

2326
02:51:39,498 --> 02:51:43,461
MATT: If you look up, it's-- the weather over
here's been fairly clear. There are a few wispy

2327
02:51:43,461 --> 02:51:47,655
white clouds, but nothing that is indicative of a
storm, yet.

2328
02:51:47,655 --> 02:51:52,455
TALIESIN: If the storm has taken the city, there
will be a break in the storm, of a perfect circle,

2329
02:51:52,455 --> 02:51:53,885
where we are attacking--

2330
02:51:53,885 --> 02:51:55,464
WILL: The eye of a hurricane.

2331
02:51:55,464 --> 02:51:59,756
TALIESIN: The eye of a hurricane. If it is not a
force, we can certainly look for it.

2332
02:51:59,756 --> 02:52:04,077
LIAM: And if the skies are clear, they'll not be
clear.

2333
02:52:04,077 --> 02:52:06,773
TALIESIN: It will be a nice column that will--

2334
02:52:06,773 --> 02:52:08,451
MATT: "All right. Then--"

2335
02:52:08,451 --> 02:52:10,767
WILL: Look for the stillness in the storm.

2336
02:52:10,767 --> 02:52:13,691
MATT: "We shall. Travel safe, travel swift."

2337
02:52:13,691 --> 02:52:15,519
MARY: Safe journey.

2338
02:52:15,519 --> 02:52:17,085
MATT: "You as well, good luck."

2339
02:52:17,085 --> 02:52:22,901
SAM: Be pleased. Remember, the plan is chaos.

2340
02:52:22,901 --> 02:52:25,084
LAURA: Total chaos.

2341
02:52:25,084 --> 02:52:26,854
WILL: Chaos can work.

2342
02:52:26,854 --> 02:52:28,300
TALIESIN: Chaos works very well.

2343
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:29,718
LAURA: We make our way to Greyskull.

2344
02:52:29,718 --> 02:52:32,835
TALIESIN: Back to Greyskull.

2345
02:52:32,835 --> 02:52:43,460
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way towards
Greyskull Keep. Walking through, as you see rows

2346
02:52:43,460 --> 02:52:47,699
and rows of soldiers of different walks of life,
all part of the alliance of Tal'Dorei between

2347
02:52:47,699 --> 02:52:57,280
Syngorn and Emon. Many of them watch as you pass,
some just curious as to what regiment you belong

2348
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:00,563
to, and you get a couple of occasional looks of
recognition.

2349
02:53:00,563 --> 02:53:04,734
LAURA: I wink.

2350
02:53:04,734 --> 02:53:07,438
WILL: Dale? Where you been, man?

2351
02:53:07,438 --> 02:53:10,228
MATT: "Wait! Kash?"

2352
02:53:10,228 --> 02:53:12,097
WILL: What the hell's going on?

2353
02:53:12,097 --> 02:53:13,779
MATT: "Going to die today, what are you doing?"

2354
02:53:13,779 --> 02:53:15,569
WILL: Pretty much the same thing man, how's Anne?

2355
02:53:15,569 --> 02:53:19,991
MATT: "Anne's not doing too well."

2356
02:53:19,991 --> 02:53:21,536
WILL: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.

2357
02:53:21,536 --> 02:53:23,775
MATT: "Yeah, she was in the city when the dragons
attacked."

2358
02:53:23,775 --> 02:53:25,705
WILL: No! She wasn't.

2359
02:53:25,705 --> 02:53:26,795
MATT: "Yeah."

2360
02:53:26,795 --> 02:53:28,175
WILL: Oh, that's horrible!

2361
02:53:28,175 --> 02:53:29,503
MATT: "It's okay, we're going to kill them today,
right?"

2362
02:53:29,503 --> 02:53:31,327
WILL: We're getting there buddy. Good to see you,
you're looking good.

2363
02:53:31,327 --> 02:53:32,460
MATT: "Good to see you too, you too!"

2364
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:33,696
WILL: All right, I'll see you later, man.

2365
02:53:33,696 --> 02:53:34,594
MATT: "All right."

2366
02:53:34,594 --> 02:53:39,071
WILL: That was-- I haven't seen that guy in
forever. So bizarre. Sorry, let's go.

2367
02:53:39,071 --> 02:53:44,172
SAM: Small world man, small world.

2368
02:53:44,172 --> 02:53:49,078
LIAM: And we're walking and we're walking and
we're walking.

2369
02:53:49,078 --> 02:53:53,954
TALIESIN: I feel like I've had that awkward four
minutes of like every con ever. Oh god!

2370
02:53:53,954 --> 02:54:09,151
MATT: As you guys exit the side ranks of the
current encampment, as they are all preparing, the

2371
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:16,083
sun itself growing maybe about two hours out from
touching the horizon, you can see, in the

2372
02:54:16,083 --> 02:54:21,589
distance, on some of the outer embankment and
small structures that litter the walls of Emon's

2373
02:54:21,589 --> 02:54:31,710
surrounding fields, you see Greyskull Keep, a very
welcoming, longtime coming return. As you stay low

2374
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:33,944
to the grass, I need you all to make stealth
checks

2375
02:54:33,944 --> 02:54:38,135
LAURA: Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit. You roll a 20.
And then you--

2376
02:54:38,135 --> 02:54:40,611
MARISHA: Oh, natural 20!

2377
02:54:40,611 --> 02:54:41,776
MATT: Nice!

2378
02:54:41,776 --> 02:54:43,827
SAM: Natural 20 right here as well.

2379
02:54:43,827 --> 02:54:45,826
MARISHA: Really? Eh! Natural 20 bros!

2380
02:54:45,826 --> 02:54:47,598
TALIESIN: Natural 19, I haven't added yet.

2381
02:54:47,598 --> 02:54:48,767
MARISHA: Fuck you.

2382
02:54:48,767 --> 02:54:50,589
MARY: Ten!

2383
02:54:50,589 --> 02:54:54,255
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on all
of us? Is it too late? Can I just add it to

2384
02:54:54,255 --> 02:54:56,154
everybody's if I cast it now?

2385
02:54:56,154 --> 02:55:01,211
MATT: As you guys were going stealthy, I'll say
sure. Because you would have known, at this point

2386
02:55:01,211 --> 02:55:03,250
to do so. If you want to spend your spell slot to
do that, sure.

2387
02:55:03,250 --> 02:55:04,697
LAURA: I do.

2388
02:55:04,697 --> 02:55:05,707
LIAM: And that's plus ten, right?

2389
02:55:05,707 --> 02:55:07,693
LAURA: Yeah, it adds ten to all of your rolls.

2390
02:55:07,693 --> 02:55:08,584
MARY: 20.

2391
02:55:08,584 --> 02:55:10,023
LIAM: 35, now.

2392
02:55:10,023 --> 02:55:11,709
LAURA: 30.

2393
02:55:11,709 --> 02:55:14,839
TALIESIN: 35, 35 with the plus ten. 35.

2394
02:55:14,839 --> 02:55:19,614
MATT: All right. As you guys all stay low and
guarding each other, keeping an eye out to make

2395
02:55:19,614 --> 02:55:24,826
sure nobody is giving too much away. You manage
to go unnoticed--

2396
02:55:24,826 --> 02:55:27,768
MARISHA: (coughing) Sorry, I so inhaled my spit,
keep going.

2397
02:55:27,768 --> 02:55:30,506
MATT: Don't do that. That's bad.

2398
02:55:30,506 --> 02:55:32,239
WILL: Make a breathing saving throw.

2399
02:55:32,239 --> 02:55:37,956
MARISHA: (coughing) I'm still dying for a second.
Go on, guys.

2400
02:55:37,956 --> 02:55:39,653
LIAM: I rolled double ones. (wheezing)

2401
02:55:39,653 --> 02:55:52,534
MATT: You guys make your way to Greyskull Keep,
front door's open. Like, partially ajar. Not locked.

2402
02:55:52,534 --> 02:55:57,312
LIAM: I move in, forward.

2403
02:55:57,312 --> 02:55:59,318
MATT: Okay, you head inside first.

2404
02:55:59,318 --> 02:56:00,665
LIAM: I'm going to poke my head in first.

2405
02:56:00,665 --> 02:56:02,723
MATT: Make a perception check.

2406
02:56:02,723 --> 02:56:05,404
LIAM: 27.

2407
02:56:05,404 --> 02:56:11,068
MATT: You take a moment and look around, listen
carefully. No sound.

2408
02:56:11,068 --> 02:56:18,263
LIAM: So far so good. I'm going to move further
in. And continue to-- I'm going to check for traps.

2409
02:56:18,263 --> 02:56:21,050
MATT: Go for it. Investigation check.

2410
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:24,297
LIAM: Fine, sure, investigation is an 18.

2411
02:56:24,297 --> 02:56:29,065
MATT: Okay. Nothing appears to be trapped here. If
anything is out of place, you know this area

2412
02:56:29,065 --> 02:56:31,001
pretty well, so.

2413
02:56:31,001 --> 02:56:34,464
LAURA: We're making our way to the doorway, we
peek in now.

2414
02:56:34,464 --> 02:56:36,243
MARY: Is it very dark in there?

2415
02:56:36,243 --> 02:56:42,816
MATT: There are no current set torches or
candlelight whatsoever, there are a few openings

2416
02:56:42,816 --> 02:56:46,871
that bring some light in. Specifically from
Sarenrae's temple. But other than that, it is

2417
02:56:46,871 --> 02:56:48,050
pretty dark in the hallways.

2418
02:56:48,050 --> 02:56:49,954
MARY: Can I see anything with darkvision?

2419
02:56:49,954 --> 02:56:53,565
MATT: With darkvision, you're fine. As you guys
glance around and begin to scatter throughout the

2420
02:56:53,565 --> 02:57:03,149
keep, you can see signs that it has been lived in.
People have been rummaging through, there is no

2421
02:57:03,149 --> 02:57:08,579
sign of any food whatsoever in the keep anymore,
there are a number of bowls and anything of any

2422
02:57:08,579 --> 02:57:17,255
remote value has either been taken or is left used
and unwashed. But after doing a quick scan, there

2423
02:57:17,255 --> 02:57:21,286
is no one inside Greyskull Keep. Apparently--

2424
02:57:21,286 --> 02:57:22,733
LIAM: Like, the whole place?

2425
02:57:22,733 --> 02:57:23,920
MATT: Yeah.

2426
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,131
LIAM: So all the way up the stairs, to our
bedrooms, to his laboratory, all that's clear?

2427
02:57:28,131 --> 02:57:31,384
MATT: All of it's empty, but a lot of things have
been taken.

2428
02:57:31,384 --> 02:57:39,546
SAM: Can I go in the kitchen and just sort of
sense magic, or do an arcana check or something,

2429
02:57:39,546 --> 02:57:40,927
to see if there's any--

2430
02:57:40,927 --> 02:57:43,542
MATT: There is a Detect Magic spell, if you have
that.

2431
02:57:43,542 --> 02:57:44,593
SAM: I don't have that.

2432
02:57:44,593 --> 02:57:47,763
MATT: Then you would be hard-pressed to detect if
it's present necessarily.

2433
02:57:47,763 --> 02:57:50,263
MARISHA: Is your poop still around?

2434
02:57:50,263 --> 02:57:53,879
SAM: My poop is still there, it's just inert. It's
<i>just</i> poop.

2435
02:57:53,879 --> 02:57:55,935
LAURA: Did somebody steal the poop?

2436
02:57:55,935 --> 02:57:58,583
SAM: Oh, is it still there in the jar that I left
it in?

2437
02:57:58,583 --> 02:58:06,897
MATT: Actually, there is a broken jar on the
ground. It looks like somebody discovered it and

2438
02:58:06,897 --> 02:58:09,761
wasn't quite sure what it was, and then discovered
what it was.

2439
02:58:09,761 --> 02:58:11,156
MARY: This isn't pudding!

2440
02:58:11,156 --> 02:58:13,792
(laughter)

2441
02:58:13,792 --> 02:58:15,911
LIAM: This single scoop tastes funny.

2442
02:58:15,911 --> 02:58:18,769
MARY: Gelato? (retches)

2443
02:58:18,769 --> 02:58:29,538
MATT: The behavioral patterns of the way things
are left, it looks like people have come in

2444
02:58:29,538 --> 02:58:33,416
through, rummaged, grabbed what they needed to
survive, or what seemed of value, and left. And

2445
02:58:33,416 --> 02:58:38,027
things they didn't understand, or didn't see value
in, they left behind. Most of your workshop has

2446
02:58:38,027 --> 02:58:39,982
been ransacked.

2447
02:58:39,982 --> 02:58:41,315
TALIESIN: I figured.

2448
02:58:41,315 --> 02:58:46,086
MATT: Your cask is still there. And a few esoteric
tools that they didn't really understand, or too

2449
02:58:46,086 --> 02:58:50,810
big to maneuver, are still there. But most of your
toolset is gone.

2450
02:58:50,810 --> 02:59:02,795
TALIESIN: Grabbing what's useful, and maybe as a
lark I might try and run a wire from my inert

2451
02:59:02,795 --> 02:59:10,635
glove to Cabal's Ruin to see if I can actually get
the charge to travel through it if I punch

2452
02:59:10,635 --> 02:59:11,800
something.

2453
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:14,402
MATT: If you want to use one of the charges, you
can try that.

2454
02:59:14,402 --> 02:59:19,340
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll use a charge-- I'll hold.
I'll find out in the moment, won't I?

2455
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:20,866
MATT: Yeah, that you will.

2456
02:59:20,866 --> 02:59:22,454
MARISHA: Try it on the day.

2457
02:59:22,454 --> 02:59:24,259
WILL: Is this your castle?

2458
02:59:24,259 --> 02:59:27,086
SAM: Yeah, this is our house. This is our keep.

2459
02:59:27,086 --> 02:59:28,457
TALIESIN: It's a keep, not a castle.

2460
02:59:28,457 --> 02:59:31,731
MARY: This is lovely. It's a little cold.

2461
02:59:31,731 --> 02:59:33,162
SAM: But it's seen better days.

2462
02:59:33,162 --> 02:59:35,331
MARY: But the bones are good.

2463
02:59:35,331 --> 02:59:36,908
WILL: Lot of space.

2464
02:59:36,908 --> 02:59:39,456
SAM: It's a fixer-upper.

2465
02:59:39,456 --> 02:59:40,677
MARY: Good location.

2466
02:59:40,677 --> 02:59:49,258
LIAM: I'm going downstairs to the entrance, and
I'm going to check it out. And use Divine Sense at

2467
02:59:49,258 --> 02:59:50,490
the entrance.

2468
02:59:50,490 --> 02:59:52,404
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2469
02:59:52,404 --> 03:00:04,026
LIAM: All right. That's good. That is a 24.

2470
03:00:04,026 --> 03:00:10,948
MATT: Okay. Divine Sense doesn't trigger anything
off. Nothing gets you riled up in that sense.

2471
03:00:10,948 --> 03:00:12,499
LIAM: Feathers are in place?

2472
03:00:12,499 --> 03:00:18,834
MATT: Indeed, yes. Except the two that were cut
earlier from Kashaw. But you do find the hidden

2473
03:00:18,897 --> 03:00:24,457
entrance, or the exit I guess you could say from
the keep, left as it was, untouched. The seam

2474
03:00:24,457 --> 03:00:27,534
still smooth, covered in dust.

2475
03:00:27,534 --> 03:00:28,901
LIAM: Nothing hinky with it?

2476
03:00:28,901 --> 03:00:30,140
MATT: Nothing hinky, no traps.

2477
03:00:30,140 --> 03:00:34,262
SAM: Let's go down to the secret path. We're in a
hurry now, we've got to get into the city.

2478
03:00:34,262 --> 03:00:40,100
TALIESIN: Oh, I show Kashaw the cask, by the way. I
have some powdered death, if you like. This will

2479
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:42,151
explode very loudly.

2480
03:00:42,151 --> 03:00:44,037
WILL: How much damage?

2481
03:00:44,037 --> 03:00:51,738
TALIESIN: You know, I've honestly been too nervous
to ever find out. Because everybody who plays with

2482
03:00:51,738 --> 03:00:53,647
this loses a limb eventually.

2483
03:00:53,647 --> 03:00:55,231
WILL: Is it heavy?

2484
03:00:55,231 --> 03:01:00,615
MATT: You hear this faint echoing voice in the
back of your head that says, "Learn from my mistakes..."

2485
03:01:00,615 --> 03:01:04,239
(laughter)

2486
03:01:04,239 --> 03:01:06,685
WILL: I say we bring it.

2487
03:01:06,685 --> 03:01:08,286
TALIESIN: That's my plan.

2488
03:01:08,286 --> 03:01:16,649
SAM: Can I just give you a quick note? Planning
Kashaw is very staccato. He's very clipped. I feel

2489
03:01:16,649 --> 03:01:21,687
like when you're just talking normally, you're so
warm and pleasant. But when you're planning, you

2490
03:01:21,687 --> 03:01:29,240
get this voice you use that's very grating. I'm
just saying, try to even out your tone. Do some

2491
03:01:29,240 --> 03:01:31,998
breathing exercises, breathe from the diaphragm.

2492
03:01:31,998 --> 03:01:34,750
WILL: (breathes) Let's go.

2493
03:01:34,750 --> 03:01:38,154
(laughter)

2494
03:01:38,154 --> 03:01:39,694
TALIESIN: To the tunnels.

2495
03:01:39,694 --> 03:01:42,711
MATT: All right. Grog happily takes the cask under
his arm.

2496
03:01:42,711 --> 03:01:44,916
LAURA: Don't drink that, Grog.

2497
03:01:44,916 --> 03:01:46,350
MATT: "Oh come on! One--"

2498
03:01:46,350 --> 03:01:48,796
LAURA: No, none of it. No--

2499
03:01:48,796 --> 03:01:52,895
(laughter)

2500
03:01:52,895 --> 03:01:54,181
MATT: "Okay."

2501
03:01:54,181 --> 03:01:56,228
MARY: He could fart explosives if he did.

2502
03:01:56,228 --> 03:01:59,234
SAM: Matt's Grog and Matt's Trinket are very
similar.

2503
03:01:59,234 --> 03:02:09,667
MATT: To be fair. You guys all-- single-file,
because this tunnel is not very wide, it's maybe

2504
03:02:09,667 --> 03:02:17,552
four feet wide-- you make your way through and
it's a long, musty tunnel. It smells of damp earth

2505
03:02:17,552 --> 03:02:19,590
and dust.

2506
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:23,069
LAURA: We need to pass out these healing potions
before we get anywhere.

2507
03:02:23,069 --> 03:02:25,762
LIAM: Well, why don't everybody bunch up for a
second then?

2508
03:02:25,762 --> 03:02:27,092
LAURA: Yeah.

2509
03:02:27,092 --> 03:02:29,277
MARY: Is there light in there? Do you need light,
are there torches?

2510
03:02:29,277 --> 03:02:31,079
MATT: There is no light.

2511
03:02:31,079 --> 03:02:33,281
MARY: I cast Light.

2512
03:02:33,281 --> 03:02:40,166
LAURA: All right, we have three greater healings,
five regular healings, and two superiors. Who needs what?

2513
03:02:40,166 --> 03:02:41,613
TALIESIN: I'll take a greater.

2514
03:02:41,613 --> 03:02:43,656
LIAM: Superior, please. I'm weak as fuck.

2515
03:02:43,656 --> 03:02:44,957
LAURA: All right, take one.

2516
03:02:44,957 --> 03:02:47,303
TALIESIN: I'd like to take a greater as well,
because I'm always far away.

2517
03:02:47,303 --> 03:02:48,200
LAURA: Okay.

2518
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:49,962
MATT: "Greater for me." Grog raises his hand.

2519
03:02:49,962 --> 03:02:51,105
LAURA: He wants one?

2520
03:02:51,105 --> 03:02:52,016
MATT "Please."

2521
03:02:52,016 --> 03:02:53,293
LAURA: You want a greater or--

2522
03:02:53,293 --> 03:02:54,295
MATT: "Yes, please."

2523
03:02:54,295 --> 03:02:59,560
LAURA: Okay, we have one greater left. Five
regulars, so I'll pass out regulars to-- Do you

2524
03:02:59,560 --> 03:03:01,109
need any? You, you--

2525
03:03:01,109 --> 03:03:03,210
WILL: I should be okay with healing, but if you'd
like I'll take one.

2526
03:03:03,210 --> 03:03:05,423
MARISHA: I'm all right. I still have a couple.

2527
03:03:05,423 --> 03:03:08,376
MARY: I have one normal, and two greater, and one
superior.

2528
03:03:08,376 --> 03:03:10,105
LAURA: There's one superior left. Oh, you already
have a superior?

2529
03:03:10,105 --> 03:03:12,273
MARY: I have a superior, two greater, and one
normal.

2530
03:03:12,273 --> 03:03:14,324
LAURA: Oh shit. You have a fuckton of potions!

2531
03:03:14,324 --> 03:03:19,635
SAM: I'll take a superior and one of them fire
resistance, please.

2532
03:03:19,635 --> 03:03:23,874
LAURA: Take the superior, Scanlan.

2533
03:03:23,874 --> 03:03:26,132
SAM: I need the stuff.

2534
03:03:26,132 --> 03:03:30,611
LAURA: Zero superior and four fire potions. I'm
taking one of the fire potions as well, so that's

2535
03:03:30,611 --> 03:03:32,159
three fire potions left.

2536
03:03:32,159 --> 03:03:33,341
MARISHA: If I could have a fire potion?

2537
03:03:33,341 --> 03:03:34,677
LAURA: Yes, two fire potions left.

2538
03:03:34,677 --> 03:03:36,513
MARY: Should Pike have a fire potion?

2539
03:03:36,513 --> 03:03:37,870
LAURA: Pike has fire resistance.

2540
03:03:37,870 --> 03:03:41,165
MARY: I don't know, I've only met her once.

2541
03:03:41,165 --> 03:03:44,623
TALIESIN: I would love a fire resistance
potion, if one exists.

2542
03:03:44,623 --> 03:03:46,981
LAURA: Of course darling, whatever you need.

2543
03:03:46,981 --> 03:03:50,026
WILL: No, I have fire-resistant plate, but I'd
love a healing potion, if you have an extra.

2544
03:03:50,026 --> 03:03:52,528
LAURA: You want to take two regulars?

2545
03:03:52,528 --> 03:03:53,532
WILL: Sure.

2546
03:03:53,532 --> 03:03:56,339
TALIESIN: I'll take the fire resistance. All
right, one fire resistance.

2547
03:03:56,339 --> 03:04:04,095
MATT: As you guys are awkwardly passing this down
this singular tunnel, having to almost chain it

2548
03:04:04,095 --> 03:04:05,547
back and forth.

2549
03:04:05,547 --> 03:04:08,486
MARISHA: I load up Grog's camelback with healing
potions.

2550
03:04:08,486 --> 03:04:14,392
LAURA: Now, the potion of invulnerability. Is
there someone specific we need to give that to?

2551
03:04:14,392 --> 03:04:18,540
MATT: "It sounds really neat."

2552
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:21,044
SAM: Why don't we give it to Grog for now?

2553
03:04:21,044 --> 03:04:23,492
TALIESIN: Well, Grog already halves all of his
damage.

2554
03:04:23,492 --> 03:04:29,436
LIAM: Grog, if we give it to you now, you can't
drink it now. Not now. You have to wait.

2555
03:04:29,436 --> 03:04:34,334
TALIESIN: Quick rule point, if he already takes a
lot of half damage, if he takes the potion, it

2556
03:04:34,334 --> 03:04:36,113
doesn't really affect?

2557
03:04:36,113 --> 03:04:37,203
LAURA: Does it quarter the damage?

2558
03:04:37,203 --> 03:04:39,441
MATT: No. He just likes being invulnerable.

2559
03:04:39,441 --> 03:04:41,934
TALIESIN: It should go to Vax.

2560
03:04:41,934 --> 03:04:43,906
LIAM: I didn't wanna--

2561
03:04:43,906 --> 03:04:46,739
TALIESIN: Because you're gonna get close.

2562
03:04:46,739 --> 03:04:50,275
LIAM: I'm gonna get up in his shit.

2563
03:04:50,275 --> 03:04:52,435
TALIESIN: So you should take the potion.

2564
03:04:52,435 --> 03:04:55,923
It doubles your HP, double your HP.

2565
03:04:55,923 --> 03:05:01,037
LIAM: I just wanted you to be able to pl-- excuse
me? Can I have that, Grog?

2566
03:05:01,037 --> 03:05:03,763
LAURA: I still have it. I didn't give it to him.

2567
03:05:03,763 --> 03:05:05,578
LIAM: Can I have that, please?

2568
03:05:05,578 --> 03:05:07,477
MATT: "What do you want to give me?"

2569
03:05:07,477 --> 03:05:09,948
LAURA: You don't have it, Grog. You don't have the
potion.

2570
03:05:09,948 --> 03:05:11,125
MATT: "Oh--"

2571
03:05:11,125 --> 03:05:13,350
LIAM: He's holding a wood chip.

2572
03:05:13,350 --> 03:05:18,037
TALIESIN: Where did you find a purple wood chip
down here? That's, oh--

2573
03:05:18,037 --> 03:05:22,359
MATT: Travis just texted me saying he does not
have resistance to fire, which I knew. So if

2574
03:05:22,359 --> 03:05:23,589
anyone would like to--

2575
03:05:23,589 --> 03:05:25,099
LAURA: Oh! Okay, well then he gets the last--

2576
03:05:25,099 --> 03:05:28,197
MATT: The last one is Grog. He takes it and is
about to open the cork.

2577
03:05:28,197 --> 03:05:32,608
LAURA: No, no! Grog, wait for when we start
fighting Thordak.

2578
03:05:32,608 --> 03:05:34,805
MATT: "What can I drink?"

2579
03:05:34,805 --> 03:05:35,887
LAURA: Some ale.

2580
03:05:35,887 --> 03:05:36,790
MATT: "Okay."

2581
03:05:36,790 --> 03:05:39,653
SAM: Use your magic canister.

2582
03:05:39,653 --> 03:05:40,970
MATT: (whispers) "Mayonnaise."

2583
03:05:40,970 --> 03:05:44,637
(laughter)

2584
03:05:44,637 --> 03:05:47,604
MARY: I would also like to evoke Fiendish Vigor.

2585
03:05:47,604 --> 03:05:48,983
SAM: What's that?

2586
03:05:48,983 --> 03:05:54,314
MARY: Which means I can cast False Life on myself
for one hour, yeah?

2587
03:05:54,314 --> 03:05:55,411
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

2588
03:05:55,411 --> 03:05:56,595
LAURA: Do you do it now?

2589
03:05:56,595 --> 03:05:58,134
MARY: Well, we're about to go in.

2590
03:05:58,134 --> 03:06:00,359
SAM: It's gonna take us an hour to get to the
center of the city.

2591
03:06:00,359 --> 03:06:08,296
MARY: All right, right before we go in, I'll hold
it. Grog, give me a drink! Just one small one!

2592
03:06:08,296 --> 03:06:14,294
Just a shot. Don't look at me like that, I just
want a shot.

2593
03:06:14,294 --> 03:06:20,394
MATT: It's like an urn-type cask, and he holds it
over to you, and it's just filled with mayonnaise.

2594
03:06:20,394 --> 03:06:27,928
MARY: Ah-- It's so delicious, thank you so much.
No, all right.

2595
03:06:27,928 --> 03:06:32,064
MATT: "Sour, isn't it?"

2596
03:06:32,064 --> 03:06:34,595
TALIESIN: Sweet, bitter, angry.

2597
03:06:34,595 --> 03:06:41,794
MARY: It's good. It's only four or five days old.

2598
03:06:41,794 --> 03:06:43,571
WILL: You pull out your whiskey, but Kash is
already naked.

2599
03:06:43,571 --> 03:06:45,514
(laughter)

2600
03:06:45,514 --> 03:06:47,933
TALIESIN: I hand the bottle to Kash.

2601
03:06:47,933 --> 03:06:50,533
SAM: Let's go!

2602
03:06:50,533 --> 03:06:55,987
LAURA: I'm gonna give-- I don't know if Pike has
any healing potions, so I'm gonna give her a

2603
03:06:55,987 --> 03:06:57,904
regular healing potion just for something.

2604
03:06:57,904 --> 03:07:02,539
MARISHA: We're going out like we came in!

2605
03:07:02,539 --> 03:07:06,700
LIAM : We're in a little tunnel passing things up
and down in a little single file.

2606
03:07:06,700 --> 03:07:09,014
TALIESIN: Eating mayonnaise out of a jar.

2607
03:07:09,014 --> 03:07:14,969
MARISHA: Kash, pass the trail mix. Pass it all the
way back.

2608
03:07:14,969 --> 03:07:16,680
MARY: I smell a new sponsor!

2609
03:07:16,680 --> 03:07:18,198
TALIESIN: Mayonnaise?

2610
03:07:18,198 --> 03:07:25,480
MATT: You guys eventually find your way towards
the end of the tunnel that leads to the ladder

2611
03:07:25,480 --> 03:07:30,490
that leads you into the alleyway on the outskirts
of the southern edge of Emon. You make your way

2612
03:07:30,490 --> 03:07:35,645
up-- Well, it leads you through an outhouse, an
alley. You've been here before.

2613
03:07:35,645 --> 03:07:39,916
LIAM: I'm gonna, yes, I'm gonna peek through the
pooper first. Let's see what I see.

2614
03:07:39,916 --> 03:07:41,749
MATT: Perception check.

2615
03:07:41,749 --> 03:07:43,234
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, that's fine.

2616
03:07:43,234 --> 03:07:45,646
LAURA: We know where the entrance to the tunnels
are, though.

2617
03:07:45,646 --> 03:07:48,622
LIAM: I'm just looking for anything unexpected,
27.

2618
03:07:48,622 --> 03:07:50,685
MATT: It is empty and still chained.

2619
03:07:50,685 --> 03:07:51,973
LIAM: Are there poos?

2620
03:07:51,973 --> 03:07:55,719
MATT: No. It is chained shut for that reason.

2621
03:07:55,719 --> 03:07:56,912
LIAM: It's clear.

2622
03:07:56,912 --> 03:08:02,451
SAM: Should I-- Before we go out there, should I
Seeming us as lizard people? Yes?

2623
03:08:02,451 --> 03:08:04,405
LAURA: Can you do it to all of us?

2624
03:08:04,405 --> 03:08:07,270
SAM: I can do eight. Wait, is that right?

2625
03:08:07,270 --> 03:08:11,922
MARISHA: Do we? What time is it? What time of day
is it?

2626
03:08:11,922 --> 03:08:20,074
MATT: It's maybe like, at this time? After
travelling this far in Emon, you're maybe 40

2627
03:08:20,074 --> 03:08:21,446
minutes from sunset.

2628
03:08:21,446 --> 03:08:25,754
SAM: Want to be lizard people or no?

2629
03:08:25,754 --> 03:08:27,354
WILL: Has the storm hit?

2630
03:08:27,354 --> 03:08:29,569
MATT: The storm is getting closer.

2631
03:08:29,569 --> 03:08:34,601
TALIESIN: I think that we will not act like lizard
people, and also anybody who can see through,

2632
03:08:34,601 --> 03:08:36,115
there are like--

2633
03:08:36,115 --> 03:08:37,615
LAURA: Lizard people can't see through that.

2634
03:08:37,615 --> 03:08:39,884
TALIESIN: They are idiots. But they also--

2635
03:08:39,884 --> 03:08:46,012
SAM: All we need is a second to get some
confusion.

2636
03:08:46,012 --> 03:08:49,762
TALIESIN: They're used to seeing humans, though,
and as long as we scatter and are fearful they'll--

2637
03:08:49,762 --> 03:08:58,078
MATT: "I don't mind being invisible. That's not an
issue. Meaning I can make a number of us invisible

2638
03:08:58,078 --> 03:08:59,569
"if you want to go--"

2639
03:08:59,569 --> 03:09:00,801
LAURA: How many can you?

2640
03:09:00,801 --> 03:09:05,555
MATT: "Not all of you, obviously! But like, if
some of you wanna go as lizardfolk or somebody

2641
03:09:05,555 --> 03:09:06,347
"else can--"

2642
03:09:06,347 --> 03:09:07,540
LAURA: I want to be invisible!

2643
03:09:07,540 --> 03:09:08,675
LIAM: Invisible, please.

2644
03:09:08,675 --> 03:09:09,858
SAM: You've got a ring that makes you invisible!

2645
03:09:09,858 --> 03:09:16,801
LIAM: I'm busy with other things. Also, it's maybe
time for another Feast? Isn't it?

2646
03:09:16,801 --> 03:09:18,357
TALIESIN: We're still good, I think.

2647
03:09:18,357 --> 03:09:22,168
LIAM: It's about sundown. When we did it last-- We
did it before beddie-bye.

2648
03:09:22,168 --> 03:09:25,335
SAM: But that takes an hour, we're not gonna sit
here in the sewer eating a fucking--

2649
03:09:25,335 --> 03:09:29,729
LIAM: We cannot fucking fight Thordak without a
Heroes' Feast.

2650
03:09:29,729 --> 03:09:32,044
MARISHA: How long has it been? Is it almost up?

2651
03:09:32,044 --> 03:09:33,394
WILL: 40 minutes until battle.

2652
03:09:33,394 --> 03:09:36,947
MATT: Well, I mean, you guys-- It's about 40
minutes until sundown.

2653
03:09:36,947 --> 03:09:38,766
SAM: We don't have time.

2654
03:09:38,766 --> 03:09:40,401
LAURA: Can we eat a really fast feast?

2655
03:09:40,401 --> 03:09:41,982
TALIESIN: McFeast.

2656
03:09:41,982 --> 03:09:46,788
MARISHA: When did we eat the feast last night?
About this time? Are we about to expire or can we

2657
03:09:46,788 --> 03:09:49,178
push it? Was it a midnight snack?

2658
03:09:49,178 --> 03:09:54,350
MATT: You guys would choose the most optimal time,
since there was no rush to eat the feast.

2659
03:09:54,350 --> 03:09:55,735
LAURA: Yes! We would have.

2660
03:09:55,735 --> 03:09:58,660
MATT: You would have been like, well shit, let's
do it at 6:00 because we're fighting-- That's

2661
03:09:58,660 --> 03:10:07,039
probably when you guys would've. So you probably
have until the end of the evening.

2662
03:10:07,039 --> 03:10:08,943
LIAM: Three or four hours-ish.

2663
03:10:08,943 --> 03:10:11,386
MATT: There would have been no benefit to doing it
earlier.

2664
03:10:11,386 --> 03:10:17,079
TALIESIN: This is going to be over before that.
These things move quickly.

2665
03:10:17,079 --> 03:10:20,364
SAM: Am I turning us into lizard people?

2666
03:10:20,364 --> 03:10:22,439
LAURA: Some of us, but I'm invisible because of
Gilmore.

2667
03:10:22,439 --> 03:10:27,236
MARISHA: Are we making an above-ground jump to the
underground tunnels again?

2668
03:10:27,236 --> 03:10:29,662
WILL: Someone knows where they're going, right?

2669
03:10:29,662 --> 03:10:32,157
MARY: Where's the Clasp? Are we going to meet up
with them at some point?

2670
03:10:32,157 --> 03:10:34,917
TALIESIN: Once we're down there, they'll know
we're here.

2671
03:10:34,917 --> 03:10:43,023
MARISHA: How far is the tunnel jump? How long do
we have to be above ground? I'm asking because I

2672
03:10:43,023 --> 03:10:49,745
might be able to make some holes in the wall to
cut us into other tunnels and not have to go above

2673
03:10:49,745 --> 03:10:51,007
ground at all.

2674
03:10:51,007 --> 03:10:58,028
MATT: When you recall Garthok leading you through
Emon to get to the Clasp entrance, you had to be

2675
03:10:58,028 --> 03:11:01,606
above ground for probably about 20 minutes.

2676
03:11:01,606 --> 03:11:02,819
MARISHA: 20 minutes?!

2677
03:11:02,819 --> 03:11:04,248
WILL: That's a lifetime above ground.

2678
03:11:04,248 --> 03:11:09,550
MATT: A lot of it was spent slow because you guys
were stealthy, jumping from alley to alley and

2679
03:11:09,550 --> 03:11:15,347
being very stealthy. If it was a brisk pace, it
could be as fast as ten.

2680
03:11:15,347 --> 03:11:19,810
MARISHA: That was to the entrance to the Clasp,
not the entrance to the sewer system, right?

2681
03:11:19,810 --> 03:11:20,950
MATT: Correct.

2682
03:11:20,950 --> 03:11:23,317
LAURA: We could just pop down to a sewer. Do we
see a sewer hole?

2683
03:11:23,317 --> 03:11:25,669
MATT: If you want to go inspect, you could look
for one.

2684
03:11:25,669 --> 03:11:28,179
SAM: Then we have to find our way through the
sewer that we don't really know how to get

2685
03:11:28,179 --> 03:11:30,168
through. We should find the Clasp entrance.

2686
03:11:30,168 --> 03:11:33,936
LAURA: This plan is smart. Wait, once we get to
the Clasp, then we have to fucking talk to the Clasp.

2687
03:11:33,936 --> 03:11:35,237
SAM: Yeah, for a second.

2688
03:11:35,237 --> 03:11:36,463
LAURA: All right.

2689
03:11:36,463 --> 03:11:38,935
MARY: They're going to help us, right?

2690
03:11:38,935 --> 03:11:43,292
LAURA: It's all on Scanlan; he's very charming.
Kash, don't talk when we're in there.

2691
03:11:43,292 --> 03:11:45,404
WILL: I won't speak. Remember that time I saved
your life?

2692
03:11:45,404 --> 03:11:49,823
LAURA: It was wonderful, and I'm very grateful.

2693
03:11:49,823 --> 03:11:52,378
WILL: No, we're good.

2694
03:11:52,378 --> 03:11:55,993
LAURA: I'm very glad you're here, though.

2695
03:11:55,993 --> 03:11:57,539
WILL: Thank you, that's very sweet.

2696
03:11:57,539 --> 03:11:59,845
MATT: "All right, are we lizarding and then
invis-ing?"

2697
03:11:59,845 --> 03:12:05,347
LAURA: Yes, and then we're going to go quickly to
the Clasp entrance.

2698
03:12:05,347 --> 03:12:08,728
SAM: All right, I'll make us all lizard people,
even the ones turning invisible.

2699
03:12:08,728 --> 03:12:10,750
LAURA: No! I don't want to be a lizard person.

2700
03:12:10,750 --> 03:12:12,669
WILL: Invisible lizard people!

2701
03:12:12,669 --> 03:12:14,955
TALIESIN: We need someone who can turn invisible.

2702
03:12:14,955 --> 03:12:18,802
SAM: Except for myself. Myself, I'll put the Hat
of Disguise on.

2703
03:12:18,802 --> 03:12:21,012
MATT: And you're attuning to that?

2704
03:12:21,012 --> 03:12:22,937
SAM: It's an attuned?!

2705
03:12:22,937 --> 03:12:25,304
LIAM: Only if it says it. Does it say it?

2706
03:12:25,304 --> 03:12:27,276
SAM: Do I have it? I gave it to you.

2707
03:12:27,276 --> 03:12:30,626
TALIESIN: And I gave it back. That was a long time
ago. Years.

2708
03:12:30,626 --> 03:12:33,192
SAM: Fine, I'll make myself a lizard person, too.

2709
03:12:33,192 --> 03:12:35,849
WILL: An invisible lizard person.

2710
03:12:35,849 --> 03:12:37,198
LIAM: A little lizard person.

2711
03:12:37,198 --> 03:12:40,227
MARY: Sam, I can do me.

2712
03:12:40,227 --> 03:12:43,107
LAURA: Don't waste a spell.

2713
03:12:43,107 --> 03:12:44,847
MARY: I'm not. It's an invocation.

2714
03:12:44,847 --> 03:12:46,911
MATT: Seeming affects how many people?

2715
03:12:46,911 --> 03:12:53,040
SAM: As many as are near me when I cast it. Any
number of creatures, it says.

2716
03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:58,003
MATT: That is awesome! Seeming is broken!

2717
03:12:58,003 --> 03:13:00,116
SAM: Seeming is broken.

2718
03:13:00,116 --> 03:13:05,605
TALIESIN: How appropriate that we're going to be
underground lizard people in the city of Los Angeles.

2719
03:13:05,605 --> 03:13:07,730
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very appropriate.

2720
03:13:07,730 --> 03:13:13,941
TALIESIN: It is our best urban myth. The lizard
people of Los Angeles.

2721
03:13:13,941 --> 03:13:17,163
WILL: That's not a myth. I have a friend who knows
somebody who saw one.

2722
03:13:17,163 --> 03:13:18,614
TALIESIN: That's true!

2723
03:13:18,614 --> 03:13:24,487
SAM: I make them all very skinny,
not-well-nourished lizard people. Except for me.

2724
03:13:24,487 --> 03:13:26,567
I'm pretty big.

2725
03:13:26,567 --> 03:13:33,960
MATT: You now have a cluster. As Gilmore begins
his incantation for the Invisibility spell for

2726
03:13:33,960 --> 03:13:41,776
him, Vax, and Vex, you guys all watch as each of
your forms become these emaciated lizardfolk,

2727
03:13:41,776 --> 03:13:50,387
except for Scanlan, who is this much shorter, but
Wolverine-stocky-looking lizardman.

2728
03:13:50,387 --> 03:13:52,613
SAM: It's a glandular problem.

2729
03:13:52,613 --> 03:13:55,587
MARY: It's the mayonnaise.

2730
03:13:55,587 --> 03:14:07,922
MATT: You hear Gilmore chuckle mid-incantation.
(chanting) "You're ridiculous." (chanting) He

2731
03:14:07,922 --> 03:14:11,566
finishes the incantation, and Gilmore, Vex, and
Vax vanish.

2732
03:14:11,566 --> 03:14:14,901
LIAM: Can't see us, motherfucker!

2733
03:14:14,901 --> 03:14:18,697
TALIESIN: I suppose the invisible people will lead
the way.

2734
03:14:18,697 --> 03:14:23,783
SAM: Let's go!

2735
03:14:23,783 --> 03:14:25,801
WILL: Who knows where they're going?

2736
03:14:25,801 --> 03:14:28,293
LAURA: We do; we all followed Garthok.

2737
03:14:28,293 --> 03:14:31,485
WILL: Okay. Can we see the invisible people?

2738
03:14:31,485 --> 03:14:32,873
MATT: No.

2739
03:14:32,873 --> 03:14:35,137
WILL: Then how the fuck are we going to follow
you?

2740
03:14:35,137 --> 03:14:36,841
TALIESIN: We also know.

2741
03:14:36,841 --> 03:14:42,885
MATT: You guys begin to make your way through, out
of the alley--

2742
03:14:42,885 --> 03:14:45,007
LAURA: I tug on Kash's little braid behind him.

2743
03:14:45,007 --> 03:14:47,524
WILL: Aw, come on! I hate that.

2744
03:14:47,524 --> 03:14:53,692
MATT: You guys make your way into the street, out
of the alleyway. It doesn't take you long to find

2745
03:14:53,692 --> 03:15:03,456
an entrance to the sewer. You do occasionally hear
the distant, ominous (wing flapping) of a wyvern

2746
03:15:03,456 --> 03:15:11,927
rider or two doing a pass over this portion of the
city. A lot of the buildings on the outskirts have

2747
03:15:11,927 --> 03:15:19,102
been damaged even further from last time you were
here. A number of the buildings have doors torn off the

2748
03:15:19,102 --> 03:15:26,650
hinges, signs of struggle on the outside. It takes
you only a couple of minutes before you find a

2749
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:36,014
grate, a drainage runoff for rain in the city that
leads into a subterranean sewer system. It is a little

2750
03:15:36,014 --> 03:15:41,892
bit out in the open. It's between two buildings,
but right on the cusp of the street itself, so

2751
03:15:41,892 --> 03:15:43,861
you'll have to be quick about it.

2752
03:15:43,861 --> 03:15:46,428
MARY: Let's go.

2753
03:15:46,428 --> 03:15:48,096
WILL: Who's opening it?

2754
03:15:48,096 --> 03:15:49,690
LIAM: I am.

2755
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:53,137
TALIESIN: Invisible person opens it and then
somebody invisible keeps watch.

2756
03:15:53,137 --> 03:15:54,665
LAURA: I'm keeping watch.

2757
03:15:54,665 --> 03:15:58,236
LIAM: I'm checking for traps, just in case.
Natural 20.

2758
03:15:58,236 --> 03:16:05,576
MATT: That grate is <i>so</i> not trapped, like, holy
shit.

2759
03:16:05,576 --> 03:16:09,075
LIAM: It's brand new.

2760
03:16:09,075 --> 03:16:14,438
MATT: No one's ever trapped it, yeah, man. You
could sell that. Like it was day one.

2761
03:16:14,438 --> 03:16:17,150
LIAM: I lick it. There's nothing; it tastes
clean.

2762
03:16:17,150 --> 03:16:18,521
MATT: No, it tastes sweet, actually!

2763
03:16:18,521 --> 03:16:21,985
LIAM: All right. Is it locked?

2764
03:16:21,985 --> 03:16:27,099
MATT: It's not locked. It's wedged a little bit in
there.

2765
03:16:27,099 --> 03:16:30,066
LAURA: Grog, help! Lift!

2766
03:16:30,066 --> 03:16:31,334
WILL: Quietly!

2767
03:16:31,334 --> 03:16:33,359
LAURA: Stealthily.

2768
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:43,887
MATT: "Okay! Shh!" He walks over and reaches. As
you're down there, he walks over, not seeing

2769
03:16:43,887 --> 03:16:50,076
you, reaches on each side of you to get to the
grate. Are you going to try to get out of the way?

2770
03:16:50,076 --> 03:16:56,804
LIAM: Yeah, I'll roll out of there. It seemed like
you had a little story you wanted to tell. Yeah, I

2771
03:16:56,804 --> 03:16:58,115
roll out of there.

2772
03:16:58,115 --> 03:17:04,766
MATT: You dart out just as he lifts it off. You
hear the creaking of metal, the bars bend slightly as

2773
03:17:04,766 --> 03:17:11,728
the strength imparted by the Titanstone Gauntlets
cause him to easily pry this thing off the ground.

2774
03:17:11,728 --> 03:17:17,975
You can see there is a somewhat eroded ladder, set
of rungs, but it is functional.

2775
03:17:17,975 --> 03:17:19,943
LIAM: How far down, with darkvision?

2776
03:17:19,943 --> 03:17:27,036
MATT: About 20 feet. It seems to open into a
chamber or sewer system.

2777
03:17:27,036 --> 03:17:30,484
LIAM: I spank him on the ass and say: I'm going
in, follow me. I drop in.

2778
03:17:30,484 --> 03:17:35,387
LAURA: Wait, Grog! Put the grate down very
quietly! I whisper in his ear.

2779
03:17:35,387 --> 03:17:40,450
LIAM: On tiptoes. Standing on his knee.

2780
03:17:40,450 --> 03:17:49,282
MATT: You guys all head down there with Pike in
tow, Gilmore following, invisible.

2781
03:17:49,282 --> 03:17:54,253
LAURA: Once we're down in there, I bamf Trinket
out of the necklace.

2782
03:17:54,253 --> 03:18:00,262
MARY: I use Beast Speech. How are you, Trinket?
It's been a long time.

2783
03:18:00,262 --> 03:18:02,674
MATT: "Yes. I'm scared."

2784
03:18:02,674 --> 03:18:05,988
MARY: Don't worry. You know Vex loves you very
much.

2785
03:18:05,988 --> 03:18:07,906
MATT: "It's why I'm here."

2786
03:18:07,906 --> 03:18:11,172
LAURA: I love you very much.

2787
03:18:11,172 --> 03:18:16,666
MARY: We'll look out for you, darling, we will.
Thank you for coming and helping us. Thank you.

2788
03:18:16,666 --> 03:18:18,336
LAURA: And for being such a badass!

2789
03:18:18,336 --> 03:18:21,542
MATT: (grunts) "Smells weird."

2790
03:18:21,542 --> 03:18:27,027
MARY: Kiss him on his--

2791
03:18:27,027 --> 03:18:30,207
MATT: It's cold. It's damp.

2792
03:18:30,207 --> 03:18:32,305
MARY: I love him.

2793
03:18:32,414 --> 03:18:42,676
MATT: You guys continue up the sewer system. It's
been a dry spell for a month, at least. It hasn't

2794
03:18:42,676 --> 03:18:48,786
rained in the past couple of weeks. It rains
fairly often here, so the system itself doesn't

2795
03:18:48,786 --> 03:18:51,986
have a lot of drainage going through. That'll
change soon, I'm sure.

2796
03:18:51,986 --> 03:18:53,884
LIAM: I'm 40 feet ahead the whole time.

2797
03:18:53,884 --> 03:18:56,675
MATT: Make a perception check.

2798
03:18:56,675 --> 03:19:01,421
LIAM: 22.

2799
03:19:01,421 --> 03:19:08,630
MATT: Okay. About ten more minutes into travel,
you're starting to get fairly close to game time,

2800
03:19:08,630 --> 03:19:12,842
when things begin. You do hear some whispers up
ahead.

2801
03:19:12,842 --> 03:19:17,236
LIAM: Hold on. Vex.

2802
03:19:17,236 --> 03:19:21,174
MATT: It sounds like four different voices are all
conversing.

2803
03:19:21,174 --> 03:19:23,177
LAURA: I creep up next to him.

2804
03:19:23,177 --> 03:19:24,727
LIAM: In one location?

2805
03:19:24,727 --> 03:19:29,637
MATT: A little ways ahead, out of sight. You're
not sure of the source; it's echoing from ahead.

2806
03:19:29,637 --> 03:19:31,897
LIAM: Listen with me.

2807
03:19:31,897 --> 03:19:33,231
LAURA: What are they saying?

2808
03:19:33,231 --> 03:19:34,513
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2809
03:19:34,513 --> 03:19:45,467
LAURA: I'm going to roll the Critical Role dice.
Oh man! Oh good, that was good!

2810
03:19:45,467 --> 03:19:51,712
WILL: There was a second where you thought it
wasn't going to be good!

2811
03:19:51,712 --> 03:19:57,356
LAURA: Where's my piece of paper? Perception. That
is a 28.

2812
03:19:57,356 --> 03:20:01,599
MATT: So while you hear the whispers, it's too
distant for you, Vax, to make out the details.

2813
03:20:01,599 --> 03:20:09,557
Vex, as you hone in your ranger attentiveness,
you've studied lip-movement, you've read lips so

2814
03:20:09,557 --> 03:20:13,833
much to the point where any dis-enunciation, you
can fill in the gaps. The conversation sounds

2815
03:20:13,833 --> 03:20:25,124
like, bits are talking about the relocation of
people, timing, "it's too dangerous," "we have to

2816
03:20:25,124 --> 03:20:32,784
"move further west," "the tunnels are down," "now
now now," and you hear a bunch of footfalls.

2817
03:20:32,784 --> 03:20:35,440
LAURA: Running away from us?

2818
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:40,007
MATT: Running in a direction, you can't make out
if it's towards or away, right now in this moment.

2819
03:20:40,007 --> 03:20:43,348
LIAM: Do we pop out now and talk to them?

2820
03:20:43,348 --> 03:20:50,052
MATT: You now see what looks to be seven figures
step into the center of the walkway where you are,

2821
03:20:50,052 --> 03:20:52,444
walking away from you, in the direction you were
traveling.

2822
03:20:52,444 --> 03:20:54,598
WILL: Is anybody still invisible and/or lizards?

2823
03:20:54,598 --> 03:20:57,102
MATT: You are all still lizards and three of you
are invisible.

2824
03:20:57,102 --> 03:20:59,089
LAURA: And they're heading towards us?

2825
03:20:59,089 --> 03:21:01,242
MATT: They're heading away from you, in the
direction you were going.

2826
03:21:01,242 --> 03:21:02,459
LAURA: Okay.

2827
03:21:02,459 --> 03:21:04,327
LIAM: Wait if I go?

2828
03:21:04,327 --> 03:21:06,314
LAURA: They hate you.

2829
03:21:06,387 --> 03:21:08,041
LIAM: Wait.

2830
03:21:08,041 --> 03:21:15,565
MATT: Three of them stop and turn, "Wait, shh!"
It's really quiet, they've all just stopped.

2831
03:21:15,565 --> 03:21:22,198
LAURA: Are you true to Emon?

2832
03:21:22,198 --> 03:21:28,920
MATT: Stillness, no movement. One of them goes and
pulls a blade out very quietly.

2833
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:37,384
LIAM: I used to be one of you. I used to be
Clasp.

2834
03:21:37,384 --> 03:21:39,173
LAURA: And then I took an arrow to the knee.

2835
03:21:39,173 --> 03:21:45,247
(laughter)

2836
03:21:45,247 --> 03:21:47,716
TALIESIN: That may be the funniest that's ever
been.

2837
03:21:47,716 --> 03:21:51,986
LIAM: So fucking meta.

2838
03:21:51,986 --> 03:21:54,199
(laughter)

2839
03:21:54,199 --> 03:21:55,914
TALIESIN: Joke has been waiting for years.

2840
03:21:55,914 --> 03:21:58,113
MARISHA: Yeah, what's up, 2014!

2841
03:21:58,113 --> 03:21:59,818
LAURA: Remastered!

2842
03:21:59,818 --> 03:22:01,447
MATT: You made it funny again!

2843
03:22:01,447 --> 03:22:05,166
LIAM: She's in the game.

2844
03:22:05,166 --> 03:22:08,017
SAM: Are you invisible?

2845
03:22:08,017 --> 03:22:09,674
LAURA: Yeah, we're still invisible.

2846
03:22:09,674 --> 03:22:14,007
TALIESIN: We're friends of Garthak.

2847
03:22:14,007 --> 03:22:15,276
LAURA: Garthok?

2848
03:22:15,276 --> 03:22:16,636
TALIESIN: Garthok.

2849
03:22:16,636 --> 03:22:21,517
LAURA: You're invisible, and you're far back.

2850
03:22:21,517 --> 03:22:27,476
MATT: Also, all the figures that were stopped are
slowly crawling in your direction. And one of them

2851
03:22:27,476 --> 03:22:32,357
goes, "It's lizardmen. Turn away."

2852
03:22:32,357 --> 03:22:36,256
LAURA: It's not lizardmen. Magic.

2853
03:22:36,256 --> 03:22:38,511
LIAM: It's a ruse.

2854
03:22:38,511 --> 03:22:43,660
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with disadvantage.

2855
03:22:43,660 --> 03:22:44,825
LAURA: Oh no!

2856
03:22:44,825 --> 03:22:49,687
MATT: Because you're two voices coming out of the
ether right now! They just see a cluster of

2857
03:22:49,687 --> 03:22:52,281
lizards in the shadows and voices going, "No,
we're okay!"

2858
03:22:52,281 --> 03:22:53,865
(laughter)

2859
03:22:53,865 --> 03:22:55,273
WILL: "We're not lizards!"

2860
03:22:55,273 --> 03:22:56,783
MATT: "Don't worry, guys!"

2861
03:22:56,783 --> 03:23:00,683
LAURA: I rolled a 20, and a one.

2862
03:23:00,683 --> 03:23:02,449
MARISHA: Shut up.

2863
03:23:02,449 --> 03:23:03,997
LIAM: Also one.

2864
03:23:03,997 --> 03:23:06,622
MARISHA: You also rolled a one?! You both rolled
fucking ones?

2865
03:23:06,622 --> 03:23:09,887
LIAM: "Cacaw, look over here!"

2866
03:23:09,887 --> 03:23:19,726
MATT: The one in the front goes, "Shit! We have to
close it! Run, run!" And all seven just start

2867
03:23:19,726 --> 03:23:22,100
running in the direction they were going.

2868
03:23:22,100 --> 03:23:23,903
LAURA: Oh, fuck, what do we do? Somebody--

2869
03:23:23,903 --> 03:23:25,463
MARY: I go running up! Wait!

2870
03:23:25,463 --> 03:23:29,149
LAURA: Drop Seeming, drop Seeming! Drop Seeming,
Scanlan!

2871
03:23:29,149 --> 03:23:30,861
LIAM: I'm running after them.

2872
03:23:30,861 --> 03:23:33,171
SAM: Okay, okay! I'm dropping Seeming.

2873
03:23:33,171 --> 03:23:34,461
MATT: Okay.

2874
03:23:34,461 --> 03:23:36,070
LAURA: Please, wait! We're not lizardmen.

2875
03:23:36,070 --> 03:23:37,671
SAM: You're still invisible.

2876
03:23:37,671 --> 03:23:40,170
WILL: We're not lizardmen!

2877
03:23:40,170 --> 03:23:45,315
MARY: Please, wait! Please, do not be afraid. We
are with you.

2878
03:23:45,315 --> 03:23:47,861
SAM: Oh, sorry, you're freaky-looking, so--

2879
03:23:47,861 --> 03:23:49,681
(laughter)

2880
03:23:49,681 --> 03:23:52,970
MARY: I understand that! I'm not a lizard person,
and I have a very high persuasion!

2881
03:23:52,970 --> 03:24:01,616
MATT: You do. Double ones is a rough situation.
They have bolted very quickly, and they are not

2882
03:24:01,616 --> 03:24:05,724
showing any sign of slowing, and you just hear the
footprints go (stepping sounds).

2883
03:24:05,724 --> 03:24:06,940
LAURA and MARY: Shit.

2884
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:07,923
MARISHA: Move fast.

2885
03:24:07,923 --> 03:24:09,573
WILL: We can't catch them?

2886
03:24:09,573 --> 03:24:13,803
MATT: Well, you're keeping in pace. So, if you
guys full bore, double dashing--

2887
03:24:13,803 --> 03:24:15,556
MARY: How far away are they?

2888
03:24:15,556 --> 03:24:19,307
MATT: They're beyond your visual sight right now
in the darkness.

2889
03:24:19,307 --> 03:24:21,490
MARY: Are they more than 30 feet?

2890
03:24:21,490 --> 03:24:22,629
MATT: Yes, they are.

2891
03:24:22,629 --> 03:24:27,630
LIAM: I shout out after them, I know Garthok,
he'll recognize me!

2892
03:24:27,630 --> 03:24:30,521
MARISHA: He also kind of hates us, I think.

2893
03:24:30,521 --> 03:24:31,810
LIAM: Don't care.

2894
03:24:31,810 --> 03:24:38,253
MATT: The, mm... Double one, man.

2895
03:24:38,253 --> 03:24:41,061
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

2896
03:24:41,061 --> 03:24:43,772
MATT: Yeah. No, they're still running. They're
still running.

2897
03:24:43,772 --> 03:24:45,263
LAURA: We're still running after them.

2898
03:24:45,263 --> 03:24:53,715
MATT: Okay. You guys follow them for the next ten
minutes or so, and you're roughly ten minutes from

2899
03:24:53,715 --> 03:24:59,504
sundown, game time, before you hear a door slam
ahead of you.

2900
03:24:59,504 --> 03:25:01,627
LIAM: I want to move to that door.

2901
03:25:01,627 --> 03:25:07,563
MARISHA: I immediately stop and start looking
behind me. Does this look like we just ran into a trap?

2902
03:25:07,563 --> 03:25:13,137
MATT: Make a perception check. Well, this would be
more of an investigation.

2903
03:25:13,137 --> 03:25:15,321
LIAM: Are they catching up behind?

2904
03:25:15,321 --> 03:25:16,284
MATT: Yeah.

2905
03:25:16,284 --> 03:25:17,436
MARISHA: Okay. 21 total.

2906
03:25:17,436 --> 03:25:18,656
LIAM: I'm checking the door, too.

2907
03:25:18,656 --> 03:25:26,184
MATT: Okay. Looking around, it's hard to see. The
sewer has slowly given way to a non-sewage tunnel

2908
03:25:26,184 --> 03:25:34,132
system that looks like it has existed for a long
time. This is reminiscent of some elements of the

2909
03:25:34,132 --> 03:25:38,267
Clasp's tunnel system that you've seen before,
though you haven't really been to it this far

2910
03:25:38,267 --> 03:25:39,429
south in the city.

2911
03:25:39,429 --> 03:25:44,534
MARISHA: Okay. I stand back before I run in with
the rest of them. I don't want to get us all in a

2912
03:25:44,534 --> 03:25:45,655
corridor.

2913
03:25:45,655 --> 03:25:47,427
MARY: Can we investigate the door?

2914
03:25:47,427 --> 03:25:49,081
LIAM: I rolled a 28.

2915
03:25:49,081 --> 03:25:51,593
MATT: He's currently doing that right now. You
rolled a 20?

2916
03:25:51,593 --> 03:25:53,200
LAURA: I like that you're talking to Matt through
the earring.

2917
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:54,579
LIAM: I'm not talking to Matt, I'm--

2918
03:25:54,579 --> 03:25:56,075
(laughter)

2919
03:25:56,075 --> 03:26:02,696
LIAM: Laura Bailey, busting my balls since 2000
and something, every chance she gets. But she

2920
03:26:02,696 --> 03:26:05,274
"loves me with all her heart!"

2921
03:26:05,274 --> 03:26:07,317
(laughter)

2922
03:26:07,317 --> 03:26:13,536
LIAM: Don't touch me! 28! Support you left and
right, and this is the thanks I get?

2923
03:26:13,536 --> 03:26:17,125
MATT: The door is locked, and the door is
trapped.

2924
03:26:17,125 --> 03:26:25,281
LIAM: Scanlan. Will you come up here, please? I've
got my hand on my earlobe for a fucking reason.

2925
03:26:25,281 --> 03:26:27,657
SAM: I'm here, what do you need?

2926
03:26:27,657 --> 03:26:30,198
LIAM: I need you to talk us into this fucking
doorway.

2927
03:26:30,198 --> 03:26:35,278
SAM: For what, are we still trying to get this
Clasp? Ten minutes has gone by. All right, great.

2928
03:26:35,278 --> 03:26:37,830
LIAM: Talk to the fuckers on the other side of
this door. You can talk to anybody.

2929
03:26:37,830 --> 03:26:44,489
SAM: I knock, knock, knock on the door. And I say,
oi, I know you can hear me in there. Sorry for the

2930
03:26:44,489 --> 03:26:50,092
scare. We're friends, and we're here to help you
get a lot of gold.

2931
03:26:50,092 --> 03:26:56,236
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

2932
03:26:56,236 --> 03:26:58,495
SAM: Because it's through a door.

2933
03:26:58,495 --> 03:26:59,885
MATT: And because they--

2934
03:26:59,885 --> 03:27:02,231
MARISHA: Because we're assholes.

2935
03:27:02,231 --> 03:27:05,053
TALIESIN: You should try and sell them drugs. I
think that would go well.

2936
03:27:05,053 --> 03:27:06,505
LAURA: Oh, sell them drugs!

2937
03:27:06,505 --> 03:27:08,051
SAM: 28.

2938
03:27:08,051 --> 03:27:12,013
MATT: I can guarantee you, they don't have any.

2939
03:27:12,013 --> 03:27:14,409
TALIESIN: No, he's got them, he can sell them
off.

2940
03:27:14,409 --> 03:27:16,388
MATT: They're the Clasp.

2941
03:27:16,388 --> 03:27:17,810
LIAM: They're straight-edge, I know.

2942
03:27:17,810 --> 03:27:19,416
MATT: Oh, totally.

2943
03:27:19,416 --> 03:27:22,251
WILL: You still don't know if you put it up your
ass or smoke it. How are you gonna sell it?

2944
03:27:22,251 --> 03:27:23,803
SAM: I'll find out from them.

2945
03:27:23,803 --> 03:27:37,710
MATT: There's a pause, and then a voice comes
through and says, "So. Who are you? What do you

2946
03:27:37,710 --> 03:27:43,342
"want? What leaves you the possibility of wandering
these sewers unstabbed?"

2947
03:27:43,342 --> 03:27:53,858
SAM: First of all, you, or members of your
organization, know us. We are from Emon. We are

2948
03:27:53,858 --> 03:28:08,697
Emonites. Emonies? We're locals. We've traveled
these sewers before, among you. And we will again

2949
03:28:08,697 --> 03:28:17,290
tonight if you help us find our way to Thordak. We
are super-powerful superheroes who are gonna kill

2950
03:28:17,290 --> 03:28:19,564
a dragon and give you half the gold.

2951
03:28:19,564 --> 03:28:24,509
LAURA: Half the gold? <i>Half</i> the gold? Holy.

2952
03:28:24,509 --> 03:28:40,464
MATT: There's another pause. Ten, 20 seconds. 30
seconds. Then you hear a winch go (clacking, tink).

2953
03:28:40,464 --> 03:28:54,771
Then you hear (door opening sound) and the
door just ever faintly opens, and just a single

2954
03:28:54,771 --> 03:29:04,131
face pokes through, hood up. "So. You're allies
against the dragon?"

2955
03:29:04,131 --> 03:29:05,994
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

2956
03:29:05,994 --> 03:29:09,841
MATT: "How many are you?"

2957
03:29:09,841 --> 03:29:13,697
SAM: Well--

2958
03:29:13,697 --> 03:29:16,137
(laughter)

2959
03:29:16,137 --> 03:29:17,932
SAM: About a half dozen, let's say.

2960
03:29:17,932 --> 03:29:19,243
TALIESIN: Twice a half a dozen.

2961
03:29:19,243 --> 03:29:20,569
LAURA: I think 12-ish?

2962
03:29:20,569 --> 03:29:31,089
SAM: Ten, ten? Some are animals, some are
invisible. Six to 12.

2963
03:29:31,089 --> 03:29:38,911
MATT: "We stand 30 strong in this room, crossbows
drawn. Make no mistakes, we will be watching you.

2964
03:29:38,911 --> 03:29:44,752
"One false move, you'll all have a bolt in the back
of the skull. Walk with us, we'll see if what you

2965
03:29:44,752 --> 03:29:45,907
"say is true."

2966
03:29:45,907 --> 03:29:51,933
LIAM: I use Thieves' Cant to knock out the phrase,
"No bullshit," on the door.

2967
03:29:51,933 --> 03:29:56,663
MATT: You see his chin move and grind for a
moment.

2968
03:29:56,663 --> 03:29:59,064
SAM: I did that with my penis.

2969
03:29:59,064 --> 03:30:06,611
(laughter)

2970
03:30:06,611 --> 03:30:08,387
MATT: Make a deception check.

2971
03:30:08,387 --> 03:30:10,988
(laughter)

2972
03:30:10,988 --> 03:30:12,488
MARY: He thinks you're cute.

2973
03:30:12,488 --> 03:30:13,444
SAM: 20.

2974
03:30:13,444 --> 03:30:14,339
MATT: 20?

2975
03:30:14,339 --> 03:30:16,097
LAURA: I like that he goes-- and it's a 20.

2976
03:30:16,097 --> 03:30:24,219
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) You see him go-- and slowly
back away. The door opens wider, and as you enter

2977
03:30:24,219 --> 03:30:31,924
the room, you can see there's roughly 30 people in
various dark bits of dress. The Clasp had a uniform,

2978
03:30:31,924 --> 03:30:38,628
or at least a uniform style to them, when they were
within their safe space. While that still exists, all

2979
03:30:38,628 --> 03:30:48,400
of them look tattered. They look underfed. They
look sleepless. And they all look driven. And it's

2980
03:30:48,400 --> 03:30:55,735
that cornered animal look that both is welcoming
and also a little scary. And as you all walk in,

2981
03:30:55,735 --> 03:30:59,718
they all very intently keep their eyes on you,
their crossbows at their side. They're all

2982
03:30:59,718 --> 03:31:05,616
surveying you and taking in and-- You can
definitely see them accepting that you are

2983
03:31:05,616 --> 03:31:11,457
powerful in comparison to maybe many of the others
that they've encountered. And that also scares

2984
03:31:11,457 --> 03:31:16,971
them. It would be like, 'Good. Fuck,' at the same
time. And as you all walk in, in this sullen

2985
03:31:16,971 --> 03:31:25,607
atmosphere, the one that was talking to you pulls
his hood back, and you see it's a younger man,

2986
03:31:25,607 --> 03:31:34,582
probably in his late 20s, but his face is just
currently wrecked by some sort of a disease that's

2987
03:31:34,582 --> 03:31:36,270
just scarred over.

2988
03:31:36,270 --> 03:31:38,740
LIAM: Where is Shenn?

2989
03:31:38,740 --> 03:31:42,415
MATT: "You want us to take you to Shenn?"

2990
03:31:42,415 --> 03:31:43,759
LAURA: No.

2991
03:31:43,759 --> 03:31:45,544
TALIESIN: There's no time, to be honest.

2992
03:31:45,544 --> 03:31:46,866
LIAM: Where is he?

2993
03:31:46,866 --> 03:31:53,889
MATT: (sighs) "He's probably by the volcanic
pocket. Looks to me-- at least from the word on

2994
03:31:53,889 --> 03:31:57,142
"the street-- there's something going on.
Something's going to be happening tonight, and the

2995
03:31:57,142 --> 03:32:00,102
"Clasp is getting ready."

2996
03:32:00,102 --> 03:32:03,338
WILL: Yeah, we've got about ten minutes until
all hell breaks loose. So if we've got to do this,

2997
03:32:03,338 --> 03:32:05,047
we've got to do this now.

2998
03:32:05,047 --> 03:32:07,333
LAURA: We've got to get to where Thordak is.

2999
03:32:07,333 --> 03:32:10,295
MARY: Is he by this volcanic surge?

3000
03:32:10,295 --> 03:32:16,995
MATT: "That he is. (sighs) Travel fast. Travel
light. Follow me." Puts his hood back up, and goes

3001
03:32:16,995 --> 03:32:18,297
into a run.

3002
03:32:18,297 --> 03:32:20,655
WILL: Go running.

3003
03:32:20,655 --> 03:32:22,089
MARY: Naruto.

3004
03:32:22,089 --> 03:32:29,975
MATT: You guys all gave chase, at this point, as
fast as you can. Poor Pike is like (panting).

3005
03:32:29,975 --> 03:32:31,956
LAURA: Grog picks her up, come on!

3006
03:32:31,956 --> 03:32:37,934
MATT: Grog picks her up, as he does. And she's
still like, running in the air before, "Whoa!

3007
03:32:37,934 --> 03:32:43,198
"Okay. Thanks." And puts her on his shoulders, and
they're running together. Pike has to duck low a

3008
03:32:43,198 --> 03:32:47,649
couple of times as she almost gets her head
knocked off on the low bridge area. Following him

3009
03:32:47,649 --> 03:32:53,759
as fast you can, it's around the corner, down low
corners. He's quick. And you can see why certain

3010
03:32:53,759 --> 03:32:58,345
people within the Clasp rise quickly, in that
messenger format, is they can get around the city

3011
03:32:58,345 --> 03:33:10,826
like that. You begin to get to a point where you
see a few grates up above you, passing 20 feet

3012
03:33:10,826 --> 03:33:18,340
up. You start to see more and more sewer openings.
And you hear in the distance the sound of cracking

3013
03:33:18,340 --> 03:33:19,606
thunder.

3014
03:33:19,606 --> 03:33:22,022
MARY: (whispers) The storm's coming.

3015
03:33:22,022 --> 03:33:25,164
SAM: As soon as we get out, Keyleth, you have to
make a storm or something--

3016
03:33:25,164 --> 03:33:26,103
MARISHA: Yeah.

3017
03:33:26,103 --> 03:33:27,936
SAM: Or a VM or something, right?

3018
03:33:27,936 --> 03:33:29,599
LAURA: She can probably do it through the
grates.

3019
03:33:29,599 --> 03:33:31,780
SAM: Okay. Hurricane.

3020
03:33:31,780 --> 03:33:41,793
MATT: As you continue to run, you can hear up
above, too, what sounds like just the energy

3021
03:33:41,793 --> 03:33:50,291
itself is gathering into a loud cacophony of
screeches and roars. It sounds like the populace

3022
03:33:50,291 --> 03:34:00,711
that is keeping guard over the currently ruled,
tyrannically held city, the wyverns are restless.

3023
03:34:00,711 --> 03:34:05,902
They see something happening, there's something
brewing. And now, not just those below understand,

3024
03:34:05,902 --> 03:34:14,443
but those above are starting to get the sense that
things are not right. It's beginning. You begin to

3025
03:34:14,443 --> 03:34:21,283
feel and hear bits of rainfall beginning to come
through the grates, just up ahead. The little bit

3026
03:34:21,283 --> 03:34:27,440
of light that peeks through, you can see the
droplets now hitting as you run past, overhead.

3027
03:34:27,440 --> 03:34:38,394
You hear another bolt of lightning and thunder in
the distance. And another (lightning crack). The

3028
03:34:38,394 --> 03:34:46,826
storm is getting faster and more successive and
it's definitely landed in Emon. You continue to

3029
03:34:46,826 --> 03:34:48,166
push forward--

3030
03:34:48,166 --> 03:34:50,088
MARY: How far are we?

3031
03:34:50,088 --> 03:34:52,440
MATT: You shouting ahead of--?

3032
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:53,819
MARY: How much longer?

3033
03:34:53,819 --> 03:34:55,394
MATT: "You feel that?"

3034
03:34:55,394 --> 03:34:56,621
MARY: Yes.

3035
03:34:56,621 --> 03:35:01,603
MATT: "No. Do you feel <i>that</i>?" And you start to
realize, as cold as it is up there, as it has been

3036
03:35:01,603 --> 03:35:07,882
in the past, these tunnels are growing warmer, and
warmer, and warmer. "We're not far now." And he's

3037
03:35:07,882 --> 03:35:09,145
still running.

3038
03:35:09,145 --> 03:35:11,855
LAURA: As I'm running, I'm dipping arrows in
poison.

3039
03:35:11,855 --> 03:35:13,200
MATT: Okay.

3040
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:14,442
LAURA: I've got six.

3041
03:35:14,442 --> 03:35:16,855
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and mark those--

3042
03:35:16,855 --> 03:35:18,820
LAURA: Six vials of poison. So that makes six
arrows or does that make--?

3043
03:35:18,820 --> 03:35:22,035
MATT: Each vial can make three poisoned arrows.

3044
03:35:22,035 --> 03:35:25,179
LAURA: Three? However many I can make during this
amount of time. Because I know it only lasts

3045
03:35:25,179 --> 03:35:27,513
for an hour. So on the tips.

3046
03:35:27,513 --> 03:35:29,067
MATT: So per vial is three hours.

3047
03:35:29,067 --> 03:35:30,147
LAURA: Awesome!

3048
03:35:30,147 --> 03:35:40,332
MATT: It's hard to do while running at this fast pace,
so I'd say you could get maybe two vials done, to be

3049
03:35:40,332 --> 03:35:43,800
honest. Because in order to keep up, it's a full
sprint. You're racing against time for this. It's

3050
03:35:43,800 --> 03:35:45,871
like, running as hard as you can, and like--

3051
03:35:45,871 --> 03:35:50,986
(laughter)

3052
03:35:50,986 --> 03:35:53,185
MATT: It's a little hard.

3053
03:35:53,185 --> 03:35:55,480
LAURA: It's one of those things I meant to do
earlier.

3054
03:35:55,480 --> 03:36:02,341
SAM: Just got to finish knitting this sweater.

3055
03:36:02,341 --> 03:36:06,081
(laughter)

3056
03:36:06,081 --> 03:36:16,285
MATT: Eventually, you begin watching as these
tunnels, you see collapsed portions of it. You see

3057
03:36:16,285 --> 03:36:23,890
the falling rocks that are gathered. You feel the
air itself become humid, become temperate and

3058
03:36:23,890 --> 03:36:30,889
uncomfortably warm. The sweat begins to drip down
your brow, and what you recall being the dry heat

3059
03:36:30,889 --> 03:36:37,431
of the Marquet deserts is now being matched or
exceeded by the wet, damp, humid underground air

3060
03:36:37,431 --> 03:36:43,485
of the subterranean tunnels of Emon. You dart
around the corner and follow him around this

3061
03:36:43,485 --> 03:36:52,528
curve, and it's the first time you see a break in
the rock, where a vibrant, bright orange stream of

3062
03:36:52,528 --> 03:37:00,491
molten rock is now pouring down, past into some
basin below the walkway. And you see him more

3063
03:37:00,491 --> 03:37:08,786
carefully walk around it. And now this pathway has
gone from an original Clasp tunnel to,

3064
03:37:08,786 --> 03:37:17,024
essentially, a haphazardly carved or left over and
barely functional tunnel that has been wrecked by

3065
03:37:17,024 --> 03:37:26,222
this slow incursion of volcanic activity. You have
about two more minutes of running before he comes

3066
03:37:26,222 --> 03:37:35,605
to a stop. And you hear now, what initially was
just the rousing of local lizard creatures and

3067
03:37:35,605 --> 03:37:50,886
denizens of Emon, the now-ruling class, the
lightning is every few seconds. And you hear one

3068
03:37:50,886 --> 03:38:06,743
loud, ominous, rumbling roar echo through the sky.
And it's a familiar roar. You heard it once,

3069
03:38:06,743 --> 03:38:12,333
before the fall of Emon. The storm has awakened,
or at least got the attention of the beast, the

3070
03:38:12,333 --> 03:38:19,109
tyrant that now resides over the city of Emon.
And he is not that far from where you stand. The

3071
03:38:19,109 --> 03:38:24,089
young man pulls his hood back again and points up,
and you can see that there's one tunnel that leads

3072
03:38:24,089 --> 03:38:30,391
up out of the sewer. Part of it is jutting
outward, and it's a slippery pouring of rain now

3073
03:38:30,391 --> 03:38:37,899
just gliding off of it and slopping into mud on the
ground. Most of the rungs have been rent off or

3074
03:38:37,899 --> 03:38:44,898
fallen through the erosion, or the impression of
this tectonic shift in this localized area. He

3075
03:38:44,898 --> 03:38:46,044
points up.

3076
03:38:46,044 --> 03:38:52,388
"This is the closest I can get you but I don't
know how you want to climb. Good luck."

3077
03:38:52,388 --> 03:38:58,179
And he turns around and darts back where you guys
came from.

3078
03:38:58,179 --> 03:39:01,879
MARY: So he's guiding us up and out?

3079
03:39:01,879 --> 03:39:03,732
MATT: No, he's gone.

3080
03:39:03,732 --> 03:39:06,997
SAM: We've got to get up. So wait, there's a pipe
to climb up?

3081
03:39:06,997 --> 03:39:14,526
MATT: It's a three-, four-foot-wide tunnel. It
used to go straight up, but now parts of it are

3082
03:39:14,526 --> 03:39:20,029
(ground cracks). It's a little crooked and some of
the initial climbing rungs have eroded away.

3083
03:39:20,029 --> 03:39:21,678
LAURA: Can we parkour up?

3084
03:39:21,678 --> 03:39:24,478
MATT: Certainly. Go ahead and make acrobatics
checks, both of you guys.

3085
03:39:24,478 --> 03:39:26,314
MARY: Can Grog throw us up?

3086
03:39:26,314 --> 03:39:29,401
MARISHA: Is there a grate ahead of us? Can I
see the sky?

3087
03:39:29,401 --> 03:39:32,883
MATT: There is, but it doesn't-- it looks
partially off.

3088
03:39:32,883 --> 03:39:34,064
LIAM: 33.

3089
03:39:34,064 --> 03:39:36,584
LAURA: 34.

3090
03:39:36,584 --> 03:39:47,079
MATT: Both of you guys, in a networked-twin-type
near-ballet in its execution, darting up in

3091
03:39:47,079 --> 03:39:53,791
tandem, both using each other to push off as you
hit each edge, you make your way to the very top

3092
03:39:53,791 --> 03:39:59,072
in this crisscross fashion, then one of you gets
up just in time to hit the grate as the other one

3093
03:39:59,072 --> 03:40:03,205
hits the other side, sending it onto the ground
outside.

3094
03:40:03,205 --> 03:40:05,511
LIAM: Perception check. For anything nearby.

3095
03:40:05,511 --> 03:40:08,782
LAURA: By the way, I was totally going to say I
was putting Trinket back in the necklace before

3096
03:40:08,782 --> 03:40:11,717
you started saying all that, I was just-- It went
into it right away.

3097
03:40:11,717 --> 03:40:14,344
MATT: Okay. Not a worry. Trinket is in the
necklace.

3098
03:40:14,344 --> 03:40:15,852
LIAM: 29.

3099
03:40:15,852 --> 03:40:19,809
LAURA: Oh, I want to perception check too. Just
because, you know, that 29 isn't going to see

3100
03:40:19,809 --> 03:40:21,010
everything.

3101
03:40:21,010 --> 03:40:22,855
LIAM: No, you've got to get 30, right?

3102
03:40:22,855 --> 03:40:24,360
LAURA: Yeah. No, this is a 23. So--

3103
03:40:24,360 --> 03:40:26,509
(laughter)

3104
03:40:26,509 --> 03:40:32,951
MATT: You guys both look out. You, Vex, looking
around you, you can see you are in the street. And

3105
03:40:32,951 --> 03:40:38,353
you can see there are a number of buildings
around: single-story, second-story, some of them

3106
03:40:38,353 --> 03:40:45,139
long-collapsed and burned. Some still have flames
on them that the rain is attempting to put out,

3107
03:40:45,139 --> 03:40:54,653
but the fire is fighting back. You, Vax, see the
same spread, and off to the left of you, a

3108
03:40:54,653 --> 03:41:01,431
familiar sight. The Cloudtop District wall and
gates, maybe a couple hundred feet off from

3109
03:41:01,431 --> 03:41:09,522
your current position. You can see beyond that
just a singular, black column of smoke, with the

3110
03:41:09,522 --> 03:41:15,149
occasional flicker of red embers just drifting up
through, fighting against the storm itself. The

3111
03:41:15,149 --> 03:41:21,037
rain may fall, but it doesn't seem to last long
enough to hit the ground of the Cloudtop. You see

3112
03:41:21,037 --> 03:41:28,053
mist and steam begin to rise up; the rain is
evaporating before it can even get close. You also

3113
03:41:28,053 --> 03:41:34,117
see above the gate what looks to be a few dozen
small, dark shapes. You take a moment to focus

3114
03:41:34,117 --> 03:41:39,051
before you can see what looks to be-- what were
once people are now blackened husks that have been

3115
03:41:39,051 --> 03:41:44,543
left up on chains; decoration, if you will, for
the outside of the Cloudtop. It's a warning, or a

3116
03:41:44,543 --> 03:41:53,028
celebration of Thordak's rule. You see, on the
outside of that gate, two large, armored, alert

3117
03:41:53,028 --> 03:41:58,810
fire giants, wielding long, thick, square, black
metal blades that themselves have flames

3118
03:41:58,810 --> 03:42:04,345
engulfing. And they are both standing there, just
shoulder to shoulder, looking about, on high alert

3119
03:42:04,345 --> 03:42:06,439
based on the current chaos of the circumstance.

3120
03:42:06,439 --> 03:42:09,101
LIAM: What's between us and them?

3121
03:42:09,101 --> 03:42:14,439
MATT: It's road. It's just bare road. You have
buildings to each side, you're just now emerging

3122
03:42:14,439 --> 03:42:18,774
from the alleyway, and you are in the center of
the street right now.

3123
03:42:18,774 --> 03:42:20,087
LIAM: How far are they from us right now?

3124
03:42:20,087 --> 03:42:21,551
MATT: They're a little over a hundred feet.

3125
03:42:21,551 --> 03:42:23,162
SAM: Two fire giants?

3126
03:42:23,162 --> 03:42:24,313
LAURA: Yeah.

3127
03:42:24,313 --> 03:42:27,492
LIAM: I pull Vex out of view--

3128
03:42:27,492 --> 03:42:29,098
LAURA: I mean, we're invisible.

3129
03:42:29,098 --> 03:42:37,089
LIAM: I know, I don't want to be heard. We've got 
two fucking giants up here, guarding our path--

3130
03:42:37,089 --> 03:42:39,925
LAURA: About a hundred feet off, clear view.

3131
03:42:39,925 --> 03:42:42,909
SAM: There's no more tunnel down here, right?

3132
03:42:42,909 --> 03:42:49,270
MATT: No, it goes for another five or six feet,
and then it is just wrecked, it's collapsed,

3133
03:42:49,270 --> 03:42:50,358
ruined--

3134
03:42:50,358 --> 03:42:55,028
SAM: We cannot spend our energy fighting these
guys. We have to distract them away and move in

3135
03:42:55,028 --> 03:42:56,524
past their position.

3136
03:42:56,524 --> 03:43:00,986
MARISHA: I can conjure an elemental. Will it--?

3137
03:43:00,986 --> 03:43:03,187
SAM: And one of them will chase it.

3138
03:43:03,187 --> 03:43:05,904
LAURA: Is it possible to get up and over the wall,
away from them?

3139
03:43:05,904 --> 03:43:09,750
LIAM: Three of us are invisible, but not the rest.
How do we get by?

3140
03:43:09,750 --> 03:43:11,594
SAM: Is there a gate behind the line?

3141
03:43:11,594 --> 03:43:12,830
WILL: Can we hear this conversation?

3142
03:43:12,830 --> 03:43:15,065
SAM: You can hear half of it.

3143
03:43:15,065 --> 03:43:21,143
TALIESIN: Two fire giants guarding the gates. We
have to get rid of them.

3144
03:43:21,143 --> 03:43:23,416
WILL: Can we get into a building on the other
side?

3145
03:43:23,416 --> 03:43:27,065
TALIESIN: It's just a wall, it's defensive. We can
get over the wall, perhaps.

3146
03:43:27,065 --> 03:43:28,569
MARISHA: What kind of wall is it?

3147
03:43:28,569 --> 03:43:30,298
SAM: 30 feet high?

3148
03:43:30,298 --> 03:43:33,802
MATT: It is about roughly 30, 35 feet.

3149
03:43:33,802 --> 03:43:35,540
LAURA: Can I peek my head out--?

3150
03:43:35,540 --> 03:43:42,942
MATT: Oh! It is a solid, thick, stone wall. It is
designed as a second-tier defense from siege

3151
03:43:42,942 --> 03:43:46,396
warfare against the palace and the--

3152
03:43:46,396 --> 03:43:49,730
MARISHA: Can I use Stoneshape to stoneshape us a
hole through it?

3153
03:43:49,730 --> 03:43:54,292
MATT: You know that it's pretty thick. You're
familiar with the wall. You guys have traveled to

3154
03:43:54,292 --> 03:43:59,003
and from the Cloudtop before. Let me see, where's
Stoneshape--

3155
03:43:59,003 --> 03:44:01,198
LIAM: Extend the tunnel?

3156
03:44:01,198 --> 03:44:04,262
LAURA: Or I can fly up to the top of the wall and
drop the rope down?

3157
03:44:04,262 --> 03:44:09,178
MARISHA: The problem is, I don't know how far the
tunnel has collapsed.

3158
03:44:09,178 --> 03:44:10,357
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3159
03:44:10,357 --> 03:44:12,883
MATT: No more than five feet in any dimension. No,
it's thicker than that.

3160
03:44:12,883 --> 03:44:15,405
MARY: Where do you need to go beyond this?

3161
03:44:15,405 --> 03:44:16,897
SAM: In there.

3162
03:44:16,897 --> 03:44:26,563
MARISHA: I took-- Okay, here's the thing: I took
Move Earth. I can try and tunnel us through. But

3163
03:44:26,563 --> 03:44:27,933
that's a pretty big spell.

3164
03:44:27,933 --> 03:44:28,997
LAURA: Well, what if--

3165
03:44:28,997 --> 03:44:30,241
MATT: Move Earth also takes a while.

3166
03:44:30,241 --> 03:44:37,617
LAURA: What if I come out, I fly, I move down away
from the fire giants, I fly up to the top of the

3167
03:44:37,617 --> 03:44:40,792
wall and drop the rope down? So everybody can
climb up?

3168
03:44:40,792 --> 03:44:43,439
LIAM: But nobody's invisible but ourselves.

3169
03:44:43,439 --> 03:44:45,841
WILL: It's too much of a chance, they're going to
see you.

3170
03:44:45,841 --> 03:44:47,942
MARY: They're going to see you. How far away are
we from them?

3171
03:44:47,942 --> 03:44:49,618
MATT: You're about a hundred feet.

3172
03:44:49,618 --> 03:44:52,631
SAM: I can make another three of us invisible. But
that's still not enough.

3173
03:44:52,631 --> 03:44:54,949
MARISHA: Do fire giants have any reason to attack
lizard people?

3174
03:44:54,949 --> 03:44:57,918
MATT: You don't know.

3175
03:44:57,918 --> 03:45:00,545
LAURA: Maybe make lizard people and then pop
over--

3176
03:45:00,545 --> 03:45:05,564
SAM: I've just burned a 5th-level spell making us
lizard people once for no fucking reason.

3177
03:45:05,564 --> 03:45:08,454
LIAM: And that's dropped at this point?

3178
03:45:08,454 --> 03:45:09,518
SAM: Yeah.

3179
03:45:09,518 --> 03:45:13,359
MARY: You need a distraction.

3180
03:45:13,359 --> 03:45:15,054
SAM: We definitely do.

3181
03:45:15,054 --> 03:45:16,582
MARY: Let us do this.

3182
03:45:16,582 --> 03:45:18,064
SAM: You two?

3183
03:45:18,064 --> 03:45:19,100
WILL: Two of us have to stay.

3184
03:45:19,100 --> 03:45:19,977
MARY: Let us do this.

3185
03:45:19,977 --> 03:45:21,064
LAURA: What?!

3186
03:45:21,064 --> 03:45:22,864
MARY: Let. Us. Do. This.

3187
03:45:22,864 --> 03:45:24,450
WILL: We don't have any time.

3188
03:45:24,450 --> 03:45:29,332
MARISHA: We need you guys. We need-- we need you.

3189
03:45:29,332 --> 03:45:30,916
MARY: You can do this without us.

3190
03:45:30,916 --> 03:45:32,606
SAM: Are you going to go out and draw them away?

3191
03:45:32,606 --> 03:45:38,885
MARY: We'll try and meet you if we can. In the
meantime, call your people. Do it now.

3192
03:45:38,885 --> 03:45:41,603
SAM: Absolutely.

3193
03:45:41,603 --> 03:45:51,886
MARY: I cast-- I invoke-- I use a cantrip Mask of
Many Faces. As a lizard person, I go ten feet so

3194
03:45:51,886 --> 03:45:58,794
I'm within 90 feet, and I cast Evard's Black
Tentacles on the two fire giants.

3195
03:45:58,794 --> 03:46:00,823
TALIESIN: You've got to go out the tunnel first.

3196
03:46:00,823 --> 03:46:08,985
MARISHA: I grab Kash by the arm really fast, and I
just say, thank you. And I give him a kiss on the cheek.

3197
03:46:08,985 --> 03:46:12,137
WILL: We're way past that.

3198
03:46:12,137 --> 03:46:14,836
MARISHA: Just shut up and appreciate it! Go!

3199
03:46:14,836 --> 03:46:25,904
MARY: Before I go running out, I grab Vex. I love
you, if I can find you, I will. If not, stay alive.

3200
03:46:25,904 --> 03:46:27,556
WILL: I grab Vax real quick. Hey!

3201
03:46:27,556 --> 03:46:28,420
LIAM: Yeah?

3202
03:46:28,420 --> 03:46:29,381
WILL: Two things.

3203
03:46:29,381 --> 03:46:30,442
LIAM: What's that?

3204
03:46:30,442 --> 03:46:36,195
WILL: First: it's one-one. And second: don't get
us all dead.

3205
03:46:36,195 --> 03:46:37,531
LIAM: All right, cutie.

3206
03:46:37,531 --> 03:46:39,759
WILL: Good luck in battle.

3207
03:46:39,759 --> 03:46:48,064
MARY: So I go running out. Lizard face. Once I get
out of the tunnel, Mask of Many Faces, lizard. I

3208
03:46:48,064 --> 03:46:52,297
just go walking up. Within 90 feet, I cast Evard's
Black Tentacles, hoping to hold them.

3209
03:46:52,297 --> 03:46:55,086
MATT: Okay. As she's doing this, anyone else doing
anything else? Are you--?

3210
03:46:55,086 --> 03:46:58,384
SAM: I put on Gloves of Climbing to climb up
the thing.

3211
03:46:58,384 --> 03:47:00,292
TALIESIN: Spiderwalk.

3212
03:47:00,292 --> 03:47:06,147
WILL: Kash just stands with his back to them,
guarding them as they're going up the wall, spear

3213
03:47:06,147 --> 03:47:07,191
at the ready.

3214
03:47:07,191 --> 03:47:08,234
MATT: Okay.

3215
03:47:08,234 --> 03:47:10,089
LIAM: Are you brooming it? I'm holding onto the
broom.

3216
03:47:10,089 --> 03:47:11,884
MATT: Okay. You guys go up there.

3217
03:47:11,884 --> 03:47:15,724
LAURA: I drop the rope down so Grog and Pike and
everybody else can go up.

3218
03:47:15,724 --> 03:47:20,963
MATT: Easy enough. You all eventually get your way
up to the top and duck in an alley. I need you

3219
03:47:20,963 --> 03:47:22,832
to roll stealth checks.

3220
03:47:22,832 --> 03:47:23,968
TALIESIN: We still have that--

3221
03:47:23,968 --> 03:47:25,654
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace that I cast? Yeah--

3222
03:47:25,654 --> 03:47:29,370
MATT: All of you would, since it hasn't expired.
It's an hour concentration.

3223
03:47:29,370 --> 03:47:30,893
SAM: 27.

3224
03:47:30,893 --> 03:47:33,510
LAURA: Can I cast it again?

3225
03:47:33,510 --> 03:47:40,771
MATT: No, I mean it's still on. It's an hour
concentration. It'll last until--

3226
03:47:40,771 --> 03:47:42,029
TALIESIN: 21.

3227
03:47:42,029 --> 03:47:43,928
MATT: Well actually, you cast it right before you
guys got to the keep, right?

3228
03:47:43,928 --> 03:47:45,316
LAURA: Right, at the keep.

3229
03:47:45,316 --> 03:47:48,935
MATT: No, no-- Yeah, so you do not have it
currently. I'm sorry.

3230
03:47:48,935 --> 03:47:50,169
MARISHA: 18.

3231
03:47:50,169 --> 03:47:51,411
TALIESIN: 11.

3232
03:47:51,411 --> 03:47:53,056
LAURA: Do we get advantage because we're
invisible?

3233
03:47:53,056 --> 03:47:54,741
MATT: The invisible folks do, yeah.

3234
03:47:54,741 --> 03:47:55,965
LAURA: Ah okay, good.

3235
03:47:55,965 --> 03:47:57,391
WILL: (chuckles) Invisible folks.

3236
03:47:57,391 --> 03:48:00,014
LIAM: 31.

3237
03:48:00,014 --> 03:48:01,967
LAURA: 21.

3238
03:48:01,967 --> 03:48:03,732
SAM: 27.

3239
03:48:03,732 --> 03:48:12,692
MATT: All right. And-- okay. You guys manage to
dart up-- you notice-- First off, the

3240
03:48:12,692 --> 03:48:21,731
wyverns are now coasting by and scooting over the
sky, in groups of ten at a time. And you can see

3241
03:48:21,731 --> 03:48:26,712
now as the bolts of energy are starting to hit--
Off in the distance, you see a flash and (lighting

3242
03:48:26,712 --> 03:48:30,985
strikes) as one gets taken down by a bolt of
lightning. The wind is now picking up and

3243
03:48:30,985 --> 03:48:35,279
beginning to swirl. You watch as they're having a
hard time flying and being harried by the

3244
03:48:35,279 --> 03:48:42,568
elements, just darting around and slamming into
them. One of the fire giants sees movement over

3245
03:48:42,568 --> 03:48:50,130
in your direction (speaks in Giant), and starts
walking that way as you begin to emerge in your

3246
03:48:50,130 --> 03:48:51,934
lizard-person form.

3247
03:48:51,934 --> 03:48:55,888
SAM: Can I quietly inspire Kash?

3248
03:48:55,888 --> 03:48:58,635
MATT: You can if you like.

3249
03:48:58,635 --> 03:49:13,507
SAM: (singing) Kash! King of the Universe! Kash!
Ah-ah! He is the best of us!

3250
03:49:13,507 --> 03:49:15,966
WILL: (singing) And his hair was parted in the
middle--

3251
03:49:15,966 --> 03:49:18,462
(laughter)

3252
03:49:18,462 --> 03:49:20,415
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration die.

3253
03:49:20,415 --> 03:49:21,818
WILL: Where's my d12?

3254
03:49:21,818 --> 03:49:24,172
MARY: You just hold on to it.

3255
03:49:24,172 --> 03:49:27,585
WILL: My gosh-- Oh! Yeah, I'm just holding it.

3256
03:49:27,585 --> 03:49:28,806
(laughter)

3257
03:49:28,806 --> 03:49:34,003
MATT: So, as you walk forward and lift your hands
up, clutching the staff, you watch as these black

3258
03:49:34,003 --> 03:49:39,277
ethereal tentacles burst out of the ground, slam
into the ground, and attempt to wrap around the legs

3259
03:49:39,277 --> 03:49:43,616
and lower body of these giants. What is your spell
DC?

3260
03:49:43,616 --> 03:49:49,249
SAM: It's been a while since she's played, guys.

3261
03:49:49,249 --> 03:49:50,683
MARY: 18.

3262
03:49:50,683 --> 03:49:59,869
MATT: 18, all right. The fire giant-- oh! Nope! A
two and a three on their dex save.

3263
03:49:59,869 --> 03:50:01,352
(cheering)

3264
03:50:01,352 --> 03:50:07,041
MATT: All right. Yeah, so they're both restrained
and they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage, if you

3265
03:50:07,041 --> 03:50:10,467
want to go ahead and roll that.

3266
03:50:10,467 --> 03:50:28,704
MARY: 3d6? They're restrained! And it's 3d6
bludgeoning damage, which is ten.

3267
03:50:28,704 --> 03:50:32,725
SAM: Both of them? You just restrained two fire
giants?! Holy shit!

3268
03:50:32,725 --> 03:50:34,557
TALIESIN: Ten is on the good side of 3d6--

3269
03:50:34,557 --> 03:50:37,913
MATT: You watch as it pulls them back, their
swords are held at bay, their wrists are bound by

3270
03:50:37,977 --> 03:50:46,045
these tentacles, and both of them are being
crushed by it. And the other one-- No one here

3271
03:50:46,045 --> 03:50:47,764
speaks Giant, except for Grog.

3272
03:50:47,764 --> 03:50:49,518
WILL: I speak Giant.

3273
03:50:49,518 --> 03:50:50,651
MATT: You do?

3274
03:50:50,651 --> 03:50:59,324
MATT: You and Grog hear it, and it just says,
"Under attack!" in Giant. And as they're both

3275
03:50:59,324 --> 03:51:02,793
being held there, as you're holding them in place,
they take the damage. What are the rest of you

3276
03:51:02,793 --> 03:51:04,164
guys doing?

3277
03:51:04,164 --> 03:51:10,184
MARISHA: I immediately, right above us, create a
little eye-of-the-hurricane. And you know when it

3278
03:51:10,184 --> 03:51:15,855
snows and there's a moonbow? A rainbow? I do a
little bit of a moonbow situation.

3279
03:51:15,855 --> 03:51:20,804
LAURA: Okay, are we trying to keep stealthed
and then letting Zarah and Kash--

3280
03:51:20,804 --> 03:51:22,751
SAM: I think we just go.

3281
03:51:22,751 --> 03:51:24,507
TALIESIN: We're going to pass them.

3282
03:51:24,507 --> 03:51:26,210
MARISHA: And then we run!

3283
03:51:26,210 --> 03:51:32,695
MATT: Okay. You guys all bolt towards the--
there's a 15-foot gap between these two giants

3284
03:51:32,695 --> 03:51:39,927
right now. And you're rushing across this, like a
double-dash, you get just to them as it comes to

3285
03:51:39,927 --> 03:51:41,144
their go.

3286
03:51:41,144 --> 03:51:42,693
LAURA: I thought we were up and over the wall.

3287
03:51:42,693 --> 03:51:45,055
SAM: No, no. We were out of the pipe.

3288
03:51:45,055 --> 03:51:46,453
LAURA: I understand.

3289
03:51:46,453 --> 03:51:51,962
MATT: Yes. At this point, as Keyleth runs and
creates this moonbow in this clearing in the sky,

3290
03:51:51,962 --> 03:51:59,516
the wind suddenly doubles in speed in the air,
the bolts come down at twice the pace. You watch

3291
03:51:59,516 --> 03:52:04,482
as rooftops are exploding. You see wyverns being
struck and thrown to the ground. You see small

3292
03:52:04,482 --> 03:52:10,579
funnel clouds begin to form in portions of the
city, as the cloud itself is beginning to draw.

3293
03:52:10,579 --> 03:52:15,361
And you start seeing a similar dark speck to what
you saw in the sky before, coming to land before

3294
03:52:15,361 --> 03:52:21,915
you-- You see distant skysails flickering in and
out of the storm, control over this. As this is

3295
03:52:21,915 --> 03:52:29,546
happening, as you guys are running with that
symbol, you hear far to the left a large

3296
03:52:29,546 --> 03:52:39,003
explosion sound in the distance. It sounded like
an impact against a wall. You get the sense that

3297
03:52:39,003 --> 03:52:45,241
it has begun. You guys rush up to the edge of the
door just as the two giants are going to attempt to break

3298
03:52:45,241 --> 03:52:52,405
free from the tentacles. That is dexterity.
Strength or dexterity check against your save DC.

3299
03:52:52,405 --> 03:53:00,470
So that's going to be helpful, so strength is much
better than the dex. Not with a three! Or a seven.

3300
03:53:00,470 --> 03:53:02,677
I'm rolling as bad as I did on--

3301
03:53:02,677 --> 03:53:06,257
MARY: Stay right where you are, boys!

3302
03:53:06,257 --> 03:53:10,913
MATT: Both of them just still locked in place.
They both try desperately, staring down at you and

3303
03:53:10,913 --> 03:53:16,070
growling, you can see the strain as the tentacles are
pulling on them, their swords burning--

3304
03:53:16,139 --> 03:53:17,454
MARY: Welcome to hentai!

3305
03:53:17,454 --> 03:53:20,080
(laughter)

3306
03:53:20,080 --> 03:53:24,095
MATT: --and you're keeping guard there, at the
ready. What are you guys doing? You're at the door now.

3307
03:53:24,095 --> 03:53:26,838
SAM: Grog! Can Grog punch through it? I don't--

3308
03:53:26,838 --> 03:53:34,264
MATT: "Yes, I can!" And he goes for a full swing
against the door-- Yeah! Oh, man! Okay.

3309
03:53:34,264 --> 03:53:35,926
LIAM: (in Grog's voice) Surprise, gents!

3310
03:53:35,926 --> 03:53:51,091
MATT: Basically. So that's double-damage with
Siege to the door. Yeah. That is just with his

3311
03:53:51,091 --> 03:53:57,342
fist, not even using his axe, just his fist
against the door. The first hit, he dealt 26

3312
03:53:57,342 --> 03:54:02,524
points of bludgeoning damage. For the second
strike, he brings up the axe now, as he dented it

3313
03:54:02,524 --> 03:54:16,016
inward, and swings with it. Ooh! That's 32 points
of damage to the door. You watch as the fist slams

3314
03:54:16,016 --> 03:54:20,010
between the doors, and they're large, large, heavy
wooden doors you're very familiar with that have

3315
03:54:20,010 --> 03:54:26,256
metal reinforcements on them on this part of the gate.
The fist slam causes them to shudder at the impact

3316
03:54:26,348 --> 03:54:33,380
and shake, but the chains still holding them in
the inside are taut. The axe comes by. As it hits

3317
03:54:33,380 --> 03:54:38,650
the edge of the wood and the iron, the wood
splinters, the iron bends, and the hinges actually

3318
03:54:38,650 --> 03:54:45,577
(impact) off of one, and the gate slams off the
side, off the top hinge, and you all have to try

3319
03:54:45,577 --> 03:54:53,104
to dart out of the way as it swings past. Oh,
man! It's not quite big enough to hit all of you,

3320
03:54:53,104 --> 03:54:59,877
and I would say the ones that're at the front line
would probably be the twins and probably Keyleth.

3321
03:54:59,877 --> 03:55:05,541
You'd want to stick with them. Well, you'd be back
because of the storm cloud-- Yeah. And Grog,

3322
03:55:05,617 --> 03:55:09,542
definitely. So the twins and Grog, I need you guys
to make a dexterity saving throw.

3323
03:55:09,542 --> 03:55:11,280
Natural 20 for Grog!

3324
03:55:11,280 --> 03:55:13,196
(cheering)

3325
03:55:13,196 --> 03:55:15,436
LIAM: Would Evasion work for this?

3326
03:55:15,436 --> 03:55:17,246
LAURA: 28.

3327
03:55:17,246 --> 03:55:21,599
LIAM: That's a dex save. All right, it's just 20 with
me.

3328
03:55:21,599 --> 03:55:26,967
MATT: Okay, it's fine. You guys all duck out of
the way as soon as the door slams into the mud to

3329
03:55:26,967 --> 03:55:34,014
the side, the giants still restrained. You all
begin to charge into the space without thinking.

3330
03:55:34,014 --> 03:55:37,907
As soon as the opening's there, you dart in as the
giants are restrained. And you guys, what are you

3331
03:55:37,907 --> 03:55:42,073
doing at this point? The giants aren't going to be
held for long.

3332
03:55:42,073 --> 03:55:44,051
MARY: Kash?

3333
03:55:44,051 --> 03:55:46,666
WILL: Can I cast Geas on one and have one attack
the other?

3334
03:55:46,666 --> 03:55:50,881
MARY: Swing away, Kash.

3335
03:55:50,881 --> 03:55:53,203
WILL: Am I allowed to take control of one of
them?

3336
03:55:53,203 --> 03:55:57,886
MATT: Oh, I will see what the-- casting time is
one minute. So that's ten rounds that you have to

3337
03:55:57,886 --> 03:56:00,995
cast that spell-- It's not much of a combat spell,
really.

3338
03:56:00,995 --> 03:56:08,676
WILL: Because they're flame giants, right? Does a
Flame Strike work on them? Or are they susceptible

3339
03:56:08,676 --> 03:56:09,854
to flames, or no?

3340
03:56:09,854 --> 03:56:11,832
MATT: That is up to what you might expect.

3341
03:56:11,832 --> 03:56:16,513
WILL: Then let's give it a try. We're going to try
to do a 5th-level Flame Strike and see what

3342
03:56:16,513 --> 03:56:17,644
happens.

3343
03:56:17,644 --> 03:56:26,095
MATT: All righty! Go ahead and roll 4d6 radiant
damage. Both restrained, so they have disadvantage

3344
03:56:26,095 --> 03:56:30,491
on the save. Yeah, no.

3345
03:56:30,491 --> 03:56:33,767
WILL: I also still have my inspiration, too.

3346
03:56:33,767 --> 03:56:35,390
SAM: It won't help here.

3347
03:56:35,390 --> 03:56:46,798
WILL: I know. Okay, it's okay. Yeah-- well, no.
It's awful, I-- It's 13. Yeah. 13

3348
03:56:46,798 --> 03:56:50,094
MATT: All right. They both take 13 points of
damage. They take no fire damage, they're both

3349
03:56:50,094 --> 03:56:55,429
immune to fire. The flames do nothing, but the
radiant burst in itself does singe the exterior of

3350
03:56:55,429 --> 03:57:01,383
their bodies. You see them rock with pain as
the blast of light, a column that shoots at them,

3351
03:57:01,383 --> 03:57:05,444
bursts into them, has taken effect. Not as much as
you would have wanted, but an effect nonetheless.

3352
03:57:05,444 --> 03:57:11,003
You, who are still maintaining concentration on
this spell, what do you want to do?

3353
03:57:11,003 --> 03:57:20,099
MARY: What is the radius of Witchbolt? If I drop
Evard's and hit-- they're 15 feet apart from each

3354
03:57:20,099 --> 03:57:21,004
other?

3355
03:57:21,004 --> 03:57:22,624
MATT: They're 15 feet apart from each other, yes.

3356
03:57:22,624 --> 03:57:26,085
MARY: I just don't know what the radius of
Witchbolt is. Can I hit both of them with it?

3357
03:57:26,085 --> 03:57:29,610
MATT: With Witchbolt? With Witchbolt, as a--

3358
03:57:29,610 --> 03:57:33,165
TALIESIN: You'd need a ten-foot radius to hit both
of them.

3359
03:57:33,165 --> 03:57:48,485
MATT: It's going to be a tough call. Let me see--
Witchbolt-- No, no. Witchbolt hits one creature.

3360
03:57:48,485 --> 03:57:49,895
MARY: Only hits one creature?

3361
03:57:49,895 --> 03:57:58,630
MATT: Yeah. You can still maintain a concentration
spell and do instant spells, if you wanted to.

3362
03:57:58,630 --> 03:58:06,232
MARY: Yes! So then I will hold Evard's Black
Tentacles and use a cantrip of Eldritch Blast and

3363
03:58:06,232 --> 03:58:07,944
Agonizing Blast? Can I do that?

3364
03:58:07,944 --> 03:58:13,386
MATT: Yeah, it's part of the ability. So, yeah,
you can do that. Make three spell attack rolls.

3365
03:58:13,386 --> 03:58:16,707
SAM: Three spells?! She's so powerful!

3366
03:58:16,707 --> 03:58:18,675
MATT: It's all against one guy or it's--? How are
you splitting it up?

3367
03:58:18,675 --> 03:58:21,545
MARY: I'm going to hit two on the left, one on the
right.

3368
03:58:21,545 --> 03:58:24,547
MATT: Two on the left, one on the right.
Okay. Go for it.

3369
03:58:24,547 --> 03:58:39,702
MATT: Your spell attack bonus is--?

3370
03:58:39,702 --> 03:58:44,276
MARY: Plus 12, so 15. Plus Agonizing Blast--

3371
03:58:44,276 --> 03:58:46,010
MATT: That only adds to damage.

3372
03:58:46,010 --> 03:58:47,655
MARY: 15.

3373
03:58:47,655 --> 03:58:53,219
MATT: So the first one you fire at? It arcs past
and hits the door behind, hitting the

3374
03:58:53,219 --> 03:58:55,751
where the already damaged door 
fell off the hinges.

3375
03:58:55,751 --> 03:58:58,599
MARY: It's 20--

3376
03:58:58,599 --> 03:59:03,810
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll-- So you've hit
one, now roll for hitting the other.

3377
03:59:03,810 --> 03:59:05,437
MARY: Oh, natural 20.

3378
03:59:05,437 --> 03:59:18,397
MATT: Okay! So go ahead and your roll damage on that.
Roll your d10 plus seven. What's the first one?

3379
03:59:18,397 --> 03:59:19,772
LAURA: 2d10?

3380
03:59:19,772 --> 03:59:22,268
MATT: No, it's 1d10 for the first roll, next one
is the critical.

3381
03:59:22,268 --> 03:59:26,940
MARY: That's a ten.

3382
03:59:26,940 --> 03:59:31,125
MATT: And roll one more time.

3383
03:59:31,125 --> 03:59:32,808
MARY: Plus my charisma?

3384
03:59:32,808 --> 03:59:36,580
MATT: Correct. Add that in there. So go ahead and
roll for your critical now.

3385
03:59:36,580 --> 03:59:43,158
MARY: Six. Plus my charisma, which is eleven,
right?

3386
03:59:43,158 --> 03:59:47,865
MATT: Great! So you blast both of them and they're
still held in place. You guys run past. They're

3387
03:59:47,865 --> 03:59:53,639
both taking hits from Zahra, but they're both more
focused on the people that are being led through

3388
03:59:53,639 --> 03:59:55,955
the gate they were ordered to watch. And--

3389
03:59:55,955 --> 03:59:57,966
LIAM: How far are the twins from the giant?

3390
03:59:57,966 --> 03:59:59,749
MATT: You guys just ran through into the--

3391
03:59:59,749 --> 04:00:00,748
LIAM: Right through?

3392
04:00:00,748 --> 04:00:02,218
LAURA: We want to take sneak attacks on both of
them.

3393
04:00:02,218 --> 04:00:03,333
MATT: Go for it.

3394
04:00:03,333 --> 04:00:09,065
And five and a seven, they cannot make their
checks for shit.

3395
04:00:09,065 --> 04:00:17,181
LAURA: First one hits. And then 21, does that
hit?

3396
04:00:17,181 --> 04:00:18,138
MATT: Hits.

3397
04:00:18,138 --> 04:00:22,331
LAURA: Okay, do I get three attacks-- oh, no, no,
no, I'm not clicking the boots yet.

3398
04:00:22,331 --> 04:00:23,537
LIAM: 21. So 21 hits?

3399
04:00:23,537 --> 04:00:24,788
MATT: 21 hits, yeah.

3400
04:00:24,788 --> 04:00:28,129
LAURA: Augh, what's happening?!

3401
04:00:28,129 --> 04:00:38,848
LIAM: Okay, so the first one was-- All the dice,
all the dice.

3402
04:00:38,848 --> 04:00:55,437
LAURA: So, 15 for the first hit. 22 for the
second.

3403
04:00:55,437 --> 04:01:00,270
LIAM: 36 for my first, and eight for my second.

3404
04:01:00,270 --> 04:01:05,642
LAURA: And just keep running.

3405
04:01:05,642 --> 04:01:12,465
MATT: And keep running, okay. All right, so you
guys lob those attacks as you're rushing past, you

3406
04:01:12,465 --> 04:01:17,448
guys see-- actually, both of you guys roll
perception checks.

3407
04:01:17,448 --> 04:01:25,403
WILL: 14.

3408
04:01:25,403 --> 04:01:27,495
MARY: 12.

3409
04:01:27,495 --> 04:01:33,164
MATT: 12. You just make it-- you, Kashaw, out of
the corner of your eye, you notice the buildings

3410
04:01:33,164 --> 04:01:42,263
that were on fire, the flames that were burning
amidst the storm, you watch as one of the flames leaps

3411
04:01:42,263 --> 04:01:49,189
out of the house. And a number of other flames
begin to rise up as living, flaming entities that

3412
04:01:49,189 --> 04:01:52,871
are making their way towards you. And you can
quickly see that this is about to become--

3413
04:01:52,871 --> 04:01:54,621
WILL: Awesome.

3414
04:01:54,621 --> 04:01:55,656
MATT: --awesome.

3415
04:01:55,656 --> 04:01:57,448
(laughter)

3416
04:01:57,448 --> 04:02:00,282
MATT: But as you see Vox Machina running into the
Cloudtop District and disappearing into the

3417
04:02:00,282 --> 04:02:02,597
surrounding clouds and fume.

3418
04:02:02,597 --> 04:02:04,965
WILL: May the gods be with you.

3419
04:02:04,965 --> 04:02:11,854
LIAM: Totally minor, I didn't add my regular bonus
for dex and all that, so add another eight to my

3420
04:02:11,854 --> 04:02:12,638
damage.

3421
04:02:12,638 --> 04:02:13,860
MATT: Okay, got it.

3422
04:02:13,860 --> 04:02:17,239
MARY: So they're leaving.

3423
04:02:17,239 --> 04:02:18,510
MATT: You got them in.

3424
04:02:18,510 --> 04:02:27,347
MARY: Go! Go! We'll find you if we can! In the
meantime, my love, shall we have some fun?

3425
04:02:27,347 --> 04:02:29,278
WILL: Let's do this thing, baby!

3426
04:02:29,278 --> 04:02:30,606
MARY: Yeah!

3427
04:02:30,606 --> 04:02:37,633
MATT: You guys hear the distant sounds of battle
conflict inside the wall and far beyond. You hear,

3428
04:02:37,633 --> 04:02:46,358
in the distance, the weird, vibrating fuzzy echo
of hundreds and hundreds of voices shouting in

3429
04:02:46,358 --> 04:02:53,610
unison. The battle's upon Emon. However, that
moment quickly shifts as you're walking through

3430
04:02:53,610 --> 04:02:59,276
this volcanic fume; the air itself is sulfurous,
and there are gouts of poison that spill forth

3431
04:02:59,276 --> 04:03:06,360
from cracked earth. You can see points, little
bursts of glowing, molten rock that break through

3432
04:03:06,360 --> 04:03:15,263
the surface and pour and then cool and create
these small, miniaturized volcanic spires. You can

3433
04:03:15,263 --> 04:03:21,190
see the burned, destroyed, crumbled remnants of
the buildings-- the noble houses, the beautiful

3434
04:03:21,190 --> 04:03:26,220
mansions that used to make up the entirety of the
Cloudtop District. The homes that you'd look at

3435
04:03:26,220 --> 04:03:30,402
and think, "God, one day it'd be great to live in
something as beautiful as that," reduced to ash

3436
04:03:30,402 --> 04:03:31,784
and cinder.

3437
04:03:31,784 --> 04:03:42,965
Your run slows as you begin to see this large
crater wall that lifts up through the smoke, a lip

3438
04:03:42,965 --> 04:03:52,450
that then vanishes over the edge where the smoke
is pouring out like a thick column, a slow-moving,

3439
04:03:52,450 --> 04:04:10,703
stationary tornado of black that pours into the
sky. As you watch, two large, bulbous, scaled red

3440
04:04:10,703 --> 04:04:23,399
arms shoot forth from the center, as one long,
unfurling dragon neck rises up. You see the red

3441
04:04:23,399 --> 04:04:30,224
crystalline brow itself, like jagged daggers of
flame burst across the face as it rises up beyond

3442
04:04:30,224 --> 04:04:37,807
the smoke. The teeth, impossibly long and pointed
for something of this size. The eyes, not red, not

3443
04:04:37,807 --> 04:04:48,030
yellow, but burning beams of pure white light,
like a small sun exists in each eye. As it lifts

3444
04:04:48,030 --> 04:04:56,171
its whole form upwards out of the hole, the wings
unfurl, the wind itself pushing all the smoke out,

3445
04:04:56,171 --> 04:05:04,375
clearing the Cloudtop for but an instant, to see
its massive, swollen form. You also notice that

3446
04:05:04,375 --> 04:05:15,975
within its chest, this large, thick scar, but no
crystal. Just a large, bulbous, grown-over, thick

3447
04:05:15,975 --> 04:05:18,515
piece of scaled scar.

3448
04:05:18,515 --> 04:05:28,027
As it stands towering above all of you, peering
over the distance, not even noticing you at the

3449
04:05:28,027 --> 04:05:40,473
moment, surveying the chaos around in Emon, its
face drops, and you hear this voice gurgle up from

3450
04:05:40,473 --> 04:05:47,151
within. Sourceless, almost, in its immensity, in
its encompassing nature, it says,

3451
04:05:47,151 --> 04:06:00,571
"It appears that we have guests. Where are you?"

3452
04:06:00,571 --> 04:06:02,274
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

3453
04:06:02,274 --> 04:06:07,586
(cheering and screaming)

3454
04:06:07,586 --> 04:06:18,042
MARISHA: Can we all take a nervous swig of our
fire resistance potions? Like, right now? Like glug, glug, glug!

3455
04:06:18,042 --> 04:06:24,013
MATT: It's to the instance where, right now,
there's so much going on that Thordak is having

3456
04:06:24,013 --> 04:06:28,964
this Superman moment where he closes his eyes and
hears all the screams in the city at once. So you

3457
04:06:28,964 --> 04:06:35,258
don't know if he knows where you are yet, or has
seen you, he just knows that something's here. And

3458
04:06:35,258 --> 04:06:36,990
that's where we're going to pick up next session.

3459
04:06:36,990 --> 04:06:38,762
LIAM: Double-fisting them, gulp gulp!

3460
04:06:38,762 --> 04:06:48,348
TALIESIN: Smoke 'em if you got 'em! I'm going
to vape-- I'm going to vape my fire resistance.

3461
04:06:48,348 --> 04:06:54,879
MATT: I'm pretty sure you can get that at Critical
Vapes.

3462
04:06:54,879 --> 04:06:56,569
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! You can get that there.

3463
04:06:56,569 --> 04:06:58,157
MARY: Critical Vapes!

3464
04:06:58,157 --> 04:06:59,905
LAURA: Shout out!

3465
04:06:59,905 --> 04:07:01,694
LIAM: Merry deathmas, everyone.

3466
04:07:01,694 --> 04:07:03,515
TALIESIN: Merry deathmas.

3467
04:07:03,515 --> 04:07:06,947
SAM: What happens to Kash and Zahra?!

3468
04:07:06,947 --> 04:07:12,226
MATT: They're currently preventing you guys
from having to deal with Thordak and two fire

3469
04:07:12,226 --> 04:07:13,840
giants and a bunch of elementals.

3470
04:07:13,840 --> 04:07:16,846
SAM: But how do we know what happens?!

3471
04:07:16,846 --> 04:07:18,179
TALIESIN: We don't die.

3472
04:07:18,179 --> 04:07:20,701
MATT: Don't die and you'll find out.

3473
04:07:20,701 --> 04:07:22,910
WILL: The Kash and Zahra show, starting next week
on Wednesdays.

3474
04:07:22,910 --> 04:07:24,649
(laughter)

3475
04:07:24,649 --> 04:07:27,919
MATT: If only.

3476
04:07:27,919 --> 04:07:30,486
LAURA: It's just a buddy cop movie.

3477
04:07:30,486 --> 04:07:33,284
MARY: We're in a really old Mustang the whole
time.

3478
04:07:33,284 --> 04:07:35,867
WILL: He's a little bit country; she's a little
bit dragon.

3479
04:07:35,867 --> 04:07:39,957
(laughter)

3480
04:07:39,957 --> 04:07:42,649
TALIESIN: I would watch the fuck out of that.

3481
04:07:42,649 --> 04:07:51,035
MATT: Yeah, I would. Oh my god. That's the best
version of Dallas I've ever heard of. Which has an

3482
04:07:51,035 --> 04:07:52,404
RPG book.

3483
04:07:52,404 --> 04:07:53,505
WILL: No!

3484
04:07:53,505 --> 04:07:54,490
MATT: Oh yeah.

3485
04:07:54,490 --> 04:07:55,706
SAM: You can roleplay Dallas?

3486
04:07:55,706 --> 04:08:02,621
MATT: Yeah! I'm trying to find a copy of it. But
anyway, that's neither here nor there. We'll be

3487
04:08:02,621 --> 04:08:09,395
here next week for the showdown with Thordak the
Cinder King in the center of Emon! You guys, you

3488
04:08:09,395 --> 04:08:13,282
avoided a lot. You beelined to Thordak.

3489
04:08:13,282 --> 04:08:15,814
LAURA: We were out of time!

3490
04:08:15,814 --> 04:08:24,185
MATT: We would have gone into this next time. I
was preparing for Thordak--

3491
04:08:24,185 --> 04:08:26,214
MARY: Always rely on tentacles.

3492
04:08:26,214 --> 04:08:28,780
TALIESIN: If anime has taught you anything--

3493
04:08:28,780 --> 04:08:30,192
MATT: Don't tell the internet that.

3494
04:08:30,192 --> 04:08:32,780
MARY: If anime has taught us anything--

3495
04:08:32,780 --> 04:08:39,393
MATT: I know! No, I was expecting this Thordak
encounter to either happen next week or in the first

3496
04:08:39,393 --> 04:08:44,249
two weeks of January when we come back from the
break, I wasn't sure when. You bypassed a bunch there.

3497
04:08:44,249 --> 04:08:46,228
WILL: Great way to end the year, though.

3498
04:08:46,228 --> 04:08:47,785
MATT: It is a good way to end the year!

3499
04:08:47,785 --> 04:08:51,816
LIAM: (singing) Here comes Cinder Claus, here
comes Cinder Claus, right down Cinder Claus Lane!

3500
04:08:51,816 --> 04:08:56,180
MARY: Yeah, it's just the two of us and the fire
giants!

3501
04:08:56,180 --> 04:08:58,508
WILL: While I sit back and watch her kick some
ass!

3502
04:08:58,508 --> 04:09:00,448
TALIESIN: I thought you were dead, Fred!

3503
04:09:00,448 --> 04:09:02,546
MARISHA: You told me they were dead!

3504
04:09:02,546 --> 04:09:04,574
LIAM: We need Brian Blessed now!

3505
04:09:04,574 --> 04:09:07,160
TALIESIN: We need Brian Blessed! We need Brian
Blessed for everything!

3506
04:09:07,160 --> 04:09:11,876
MATT: I don't disagree with this.

3507
04:09:11,876 --> 04:09:14,663
TALIESIN: He might be down.

3508
04:09:14,663 --> 04:09:22,207
MATT: We'll see you guys next week for this crazy
showdown. Rest well, thank you Loot Crate and

3509
04:09:22,207 --> 04:09:26,683
Magic Puzzle Quest for being our awesome sponsors
for tonight's episode. Thank you all for your

3510
04:09:26,683 --> 04:09:28,842
patience. Thank you, Will and Mary, for joining
us.

3511
04:09:28,842 --> 04:09:32,771
WILL: Thanks for having us, you kidding? Thanks for
having us back.

3512
04:09:32,771 --> 04:09:33,979
MARY: Thank you so much!

3513
04:09:33,979 --> 04:09:36,177
MARISHA: Thanks for sacrificing yourself.
Hopefully you're not dead.

3514
04:09:36,177 --> 04:09:41,141
WILL: It's the only show where you can walk by,
"Hey, thanks, hope you're not dead."

3515
04:09:41,141 --> 04:09:46,275
LAURA: Are we allowed to say, Brian, that they're
going to be on Talks Machina?

3516
04:09:46,275 --> 04:09:47,734
BRIAN: (offscreen) Yeah!

3517
04:09:47,734 --> 04:09:56,547
MARY: So we're going to be on Talks Machina on
Tuesday. With that Brian Foster man!

3518
04:09:56,547 --> 04:09:58,263
SAM: Are you going to be on Talks Machina?

3519
04:09:58,263 --> 04:09:59,323
MATT: I don't know.

3520
04:09:59,323 --> 04:10:01,084
LAURA: No, we can't know his secrets just yet!

3521
04:10:01,084 --> 04:10:04,360
SAM: But if you were on Talks Machina, then you
could do this whole fight on Talks Machina.

3522
04:10:04,360 --> 04:10:06,337
(laughter)

3523
04:10:06,337 --> 04:10:09,327
MATT: I've been on a lot of Talks Machina
recently, and I could probably use a Tuesday night off.

3524
04:10:09,327 --> 04:10:10,425
MARY and WILL: Yeah.

3525
04:10:10,425 --> 04:10:11,743
MATT: Especially to prepare for this.

3526
04:10:11,743 --> 04:10:13,765
LAURA: Plus I don't want to know any secrets
before we go into this fight.

3527
04:10:13,765 --> 04:10:15,918
MATT: I wouldn't tell you any secrets regardless,
which is why I'd be a very boring guest next week.

3528
04:10:15,918 --> 04:10:19,233
I'd be like: I don't know. That's a great
question.

3529
04:10:19,233 --> 04:10:22,419
MARISHA: You Don't Know: The Show.

3530
04:10:22,419 --> 04:10:27,476
MATT: Exactly. All right, guys, thank you so much,
guys. Thank you guys, have a wonderful weekend.

3531
04:10:27,476 --> 04:10:34,207
We'll see you next Tuesday for Talks Machina and
Thursday for the finale, possibly, much love and

3532
04:10:34,207 --> 04:10:36,952
is it Thursday yet? See you soon.

3533
04:10:36,952 --> 04:16:26,554
