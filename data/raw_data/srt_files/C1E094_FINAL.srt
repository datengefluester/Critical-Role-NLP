1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,206
CREW: Hey, Marisha, it's happening.

2
00:00:01,253 --> 00:00:07,658
MARISHA: Oh, hi! Apparently we're live because
several people just yelled that at me behind the

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:14,452
scenes. That's Sam Riegel. This is Taliesin Jaffe.
I'm Marisha Ray. Good evening internet, Critters,

4
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:21,105
and Team Hoomaners alike. This is simply a sync
test because apparently for the last several

5
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:30,172
weeks, days-- It's not one of those sync tests.
We're not recording film.

6
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:31,948
SAM: Got it.

7
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:39,865
MARISHA: But that is still probably handy.
(laughs) So this is just me doing a quick test--

8
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:43,985
man, that-- I don't know how helpful that is.

9
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,141
CREW: Got it.

10
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,361
LAURA: I am so strong.

11
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,407
LIAM: Mosquito.

12
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,166
MARISHA: All right. Thank you guys so much for
tuning in for this technical test.

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,368
SAM: Think we're already out.

14
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:53,412
MARISHA: We will-- are we already out? Oh.

15
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,123
MATT: I got your coffee.

16
00:00:55,123 --> 00:01:00,128
MARISHA: We'll be back for Critical Role in ten
minutes if we're not already out.

17
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,339
TALIESIN: I'm Marisha Ray.

18
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:03,071
MARISHA: I'm Taliesin Jaffe.

19
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,002
TALIESIN: And this has been--

20
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,269
MARISHA: A wonderful evening.

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,139
SAM: Sync-minute.

22
00:01:08,139 --> 00:07:57,135
[music]

23
00:07:57,317 --> 00:08:00,494
MATT: Hello everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

24
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:03,274
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons.

25
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,170
(cheering)

26
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,881
MATT: We're going to go ahead and hop into this
episode soon. Ashley Johnson is on her way. She'll

27
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,424
be joining us shortly, but she's in traffic.
Coming from Santa Monica.

28
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,350
TRAVIS: Ashley Johnson!

29
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,437
MATT: But she's returned, I believe. Like,
returned-returned?

30
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,463
TRAVIS: For a bit.

31
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,415
LAURA: For a while.

32
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,914
MATT: For a while? So that's good.

33
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,416
SAM: Well, we can't be sure.

34
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,345
MATT: I know.

35
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:23,362
SAM: She could die tonight.

36
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:24,475
LAURA AND MARISHA: What?

37
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:25,902
MARISHA: Why would you say that?

38
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:26,724
SAM: I'm just saying!

39
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,767
LAURA: What are you--

40
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,541
MATT: It's true.

41
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,420
SAM: I'm just saying.

42
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,355
TRAVIS: Take it back!

43
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,368
MATT: Pike could possibly--

44
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,482
SAM: That would be really bad, by the way.

45
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,161
MATT: That'd be really bad if suddenly Pike, like,
'welcome back,' and then Pike just explodes in the

46
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,612
game. It'd be pretty bad.

47
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:36,382
LAURA: Oh my god.

48
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,627
TALIESIN: Spontaneous combustion.

49
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:43,400
MATT: Anyway. Before we get into that, let's get
to our announcements for the episode. First and

50
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,604
foremost, guys, we have until April 18th, we have
less than a week left before the Critical Role

51
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:53,146
survey is closed. So if you hadn't had a chance
yet to help us out, let us know where you're from,

52
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:56,840
what you like about the show, what kind of things
you'd like to see in the future about the show.

53
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,175
You can go check it out--

54
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,223
LAURA: What your turn-ons are.

55
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,510
MATT: Don't send those.

56
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,214
MARISHA: Your social security number.

57
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,349
MATT: That too.

58
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,962
LIAM: We've seen the fanart. We know.

59
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:12,499
MATT: Yep (laughs). At geekandsundry.com/crsurvey.
So we've got a few more days. If you haven't yet,

60
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:18,826
take a moment, fill it out, and we appreciate it.
Thank you guys. Let's see. Taliesin, Wednesday

61
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,401
Club. What you got coming up?

62
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,246
TALIESIN: Oh, Wednesday Club. We're finally--
Because I forgot that I was leaving town for some

63
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:28,006
reason that I don't remember at all. I don't
remember why I had to leave town for some reason.

64
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,883
LIAM: Die. Just die.

65
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:35,347
TALIESIN: (laughs) Yeah, we did our funny book
show last week, so this week we're going to do our

66
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,941
Comics 101. It's going to be a lot of fun. We're
going to talk about the basics of how to read

67
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:43,078
comics, if you're brand new to it or if you have
questions. It'll be fun. We're going to talk about

68
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,366
the amount of time that moves between panels,
thought bubbles, talk bubbles, all the fun stuff.

69
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,664
It'll be great.

70
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,118
MATT: You should bring a copy of Understanding
Comics.

71
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:50,982
MARISHA: Yeah, you should.

72
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,367
TALIESIN: Yes, Understanding Comics is going to be
talked about.

73
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,154
MATT: Perfect.

74
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:54,368
TALIESIN: It's a really, really great book.

75
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:58,589
MATT: Which, by the way, you should get Scott
McCloud on there. If you have a connection, let me

76
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,475
know. Not on Wednesday, but at some point in the
future, I should-- Anyway, we'll talk later. All

77
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:09,397
right. So also Satine Phoenix's first run on GM
Tips went up today on YouTube. If you have a

78
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:13,551
chance, check it out. Happily have passed the
torch onto her. She's a dear friend for many

79
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:18,257
years, an awesome girl with a lot of awesome nerd
cred. And she's bringing her own flavor spin and

80
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:24,476
her majestic presence to the new run of DM Tips.
So go ahead, check it out. She has a lot of

81
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:28,374
awesome things to say. And thank you again,
Satine, for doing that and being awesome.

82
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:29,807
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yeah!

83
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,901
MATT: Marisha, Signal Boost! What's new?

84
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:35,709
MARISHA: Guess who was on this week, you guys?

85
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:36,866
LAURA: I know, I know.

86
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,109
TALIESIN: Guy Lombardo.

87
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,052
MARISHA: It was our--

88
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,412
SAM: Did you say Don Pardo?

89
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,627
TALIESIN: Guy Lombardo, but Don Pardo would've
been amazing.

90
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,032
MARISHA: No. All great guesses.

91
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,115
TRAVIS: Foster Wayne Brian.

92
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:50,942
MARISHA: Foster Wayne Brian. Or Foster George
Brian, as I think he was originally tagged. But

93
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:58,416
Foster Wayne Brian, our very own, from Talks
Machina. He was on. It's a very funny episode. A

94
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,656
lot of us make cameos. He makes a cameo, you make
a cameo.

95
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:02,671
SAM: I do?

96
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,714
TALIESIN: I do?

97
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,700
MARISHA: I know! You make a cameo. A lot of people
make cameos.

98
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,442
SAM: I did not sign any sort of waiver.

99
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,540
MARISHA: Actually, you don't.

100
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,755
TALIESIN: I was about to say. I watched the
episode.

101
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,846
MARISHA: Matt Key makes a cameo, sorry. Not you.

102
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:12,967
TALIESIN: So several funny ones.

103
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,375
MARISHA: Not him. But he does.

104
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,525
SAM: I signed no waiver.

105
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,162
MATT: There you go. Thank you, Sam, for a cameo in
the episode you don't remember.

106
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:18,332
LIAM: You're out.

107
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,637
TRAVIS: We also took some of your semen.

108
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,736
SAM: Oh, cool.

109
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:21,897
LIAM: Wow.

110
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:30,151
MATT: (laughs) On that note, I'm flying out
tomorrow to be in Seattle, for Sakura-Con. I'll be

111
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,120
there this weekend.

112
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,236
TRAVIS: Yeah!

113
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:35,146
MATT: They've got awesome panels. Check out the--
Thank you. Travis is so excited.

114
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,925
TRAVIS: I'm so excited.

115
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:37,842
MATT: You should come.

116
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,326
TRAVIS: I just love Seattle.

117
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,220
MATT: It is awesome.

118
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,000
TRAVIS: I do. 12th Man. Woo!

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,714
MATT: So excited to be there at live panels,
signings and a bunch of fun stuff. Check out their

120
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:49,467
scheduling to make sure you can come and say hi to
me. I'd like that a lot. So I'll see you guys up

121
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:57,458
there tomorrow. Tomorrow. And of course we have
Talks Machina coming up every Tuesday at 7PM

122
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:04,278
Pacific here on Twitch and Alpha. We talk about
whatever this episode is. And I think that's all

123
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,038
we have announcement-wise, right, guys?

124
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:07,286
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it.

125
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,384
LAURA: Was it? Was that it?

126
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:09,279
MATT: Yeah, nice and--

127
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,313
TALIESIN: Oh, and we're still talking about the
con we're doing.

128
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,495
MATT: MomoCon.

129
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,536
TALIESIN: MomoCon.

130
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:18,715
MATT: That's right. In Atlanta. At the end of May,
May 25th through 28th. So me, Marisha and Taliesin

131
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,058
will be there for that, too, in Atlanta.

132
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,641
LAURA: I have an announcement. I met Sara
Bareilles this weekend.

133
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,846
MARISHA: So jelly.

134
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:26,896
CREW: Woo!

135
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:27,762
LAURA: Yeah.

136
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:28,812
TRAVIS: Oh, one shriek!

137
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:29,744
LAURA: There was a woo.

138
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:30,725
MATT: There was.

139
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:31,999
LAURA: That's all. That was my whole announcement.

140
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,709
TRAVIS: She met her, like, in the flesh. You
didn't cry, did you?

141
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,957
LAURA: I did not cry. Some people that I were with
did cry.

142
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:42,062
TRAVIS: That I were with. She's still stroking out
from it.

143
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,785
(laughter)

144
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:48,713
LAURA: And I may have held onto her waist like
this. Can you see my hand? I was like holding-- I

145
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:50,636
didn't grab her boob, but I grabbed her waist.

146
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,580
TRAVIS: Like mid-rib.

147
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,466
MARISHA: You did creeper?

148
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,986
LAURA: No, like a real strong hug.

149
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,126
LIAM: You didn't go like--

150
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,107
MARISHA: Like a real--

151
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:57,128
LAURA: Like a real hug.

152
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,203
TRAVIS: Can't run away.

153
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:02,765
LAURA: I didn't hover hand it. I didn't hover hand
it, I put a hand on her waist.

154
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,514
TALIESIN: Hover hand, man.

155
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:06,265
TRAVIS: And there's photographic evidence.

156
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,254
LAURA: There is photographic evidence.

157
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,300
TRAVIS: Your life is complete.

158
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,432
MATT: That's pretty badass. Well done.

159
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,783
LAURA: Everything's good. She was like, "Oh my
god, I love Critical Role," and I was like, "I

160
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:16,153
"know, right?". That's it, that's my whole
announcement.

161
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,485
(laughter)

162
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,347
LIAM: She strictly plays Shadowrun.

163
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,955
(laughter)

164
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:23,610
MATT: I always took her for a decker.

165
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,977
(laughter)

166
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:33,376
MATT: Anyway. Let's go ahead and dive in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

167
00:13:33,376 --> 00:15:05,097
[dramatic music]

168
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:13,085
MATT: And welcome back. So, as we last left off,
Vox Machina had found themselves finishing up

169
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:18,780
dangling loose threads after they had completed
the destruction of the Chroma Conclave and

170
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:26,325
essentially brought what seems to be, for the time
being, peace to Tal'Dorei. You helped Keyleth

171
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:33,493
complete her Aramente, where she was crowned the Voice
of the Tempest. And you all had one wandering

172
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:40,037
thread of Hotis, the rakshasa, which you have now
killed twice and kept returning to the Nine Hells

173
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:44,978
to recoup and threaten to come and slay and you
and everything you love in the near future. So to

174
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:51,975
cut that off at the head, you guys traveled to the
second layer of Hell, the Iron City of Dis, to hunt

175
00:15:51,979 --> 00:16:02,881
down this rakshasa. After signing a contract with
a devil, getting the proper information in this

176
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:09,255
regard of where it was within the Bastion of Flesh
in the subterranean prison known as Mentiri, you

177
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:16,137
slaughtered a pit fiend named Utugash, and in
response to that, as part of the contract, you

178
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:25,146
were given passage into this prison with your
equipment. You began a madcap rush through the

179
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:30,672
prison, given the directions that you were
presented as part of this deal you had made. You

180
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:37,342
turned into a flock of bats, rushed in with a new
friend, a dwarvish Blood Hunter, a werebear,

181
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,044
particularly the Order of the Lycan--

182
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,431
LAURA: Hot!

183
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:44,194
MATT: -- named Tova, who you had discovered in
Utugash's lair. You all, as bats, flew through,

184
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:48,935
averted a number of blockades, managed to just get
the attention of a few devils that couldn't catch up

185
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:54,124
to you in time, and basically the entire prison
began to converge on you as you reached the

186
00:16:54,186 --> 00:17:03,786
central area where this rakshasa was. Couple of
scuffles in transition to that area. You were

187
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:11,181
attacked by a large construct made of black chains
from this lower area of the hell. Averting its

188
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:16,171
actual battle presence, you systematically went
through the doorways to discover the one that

189
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:23,369
housed Hotis. Of which, he was quickly destroyed
while still in his larval, reforming form by Grog.

190
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,757
You all battled through the swath of chains that
were binding and pulling you back as you all

191
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:34,806
reached out to join hands in time for Keyleth to
pull out her tuned fork to the Prime Material

192
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:42,069
Plane and cast Plane Shift, and you all vanished
into a familiar flash of whitish-green light. And

193
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:48,325
that is where we left off. So, picking up where we
left off. You all instantaneously feel the surge

194
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:54,324
of magical energy burst through your body and all
the chains that had tightened around, were

195
00:17:54,324 --> 00:18:01,942
threatening to crush your limbs and tear your body
into a mass of crushed flesh and blood, release at

196
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:09,093
once. And you have that familiar sense of floating
and darkness once more. And you see that single

197
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:15,970
bead of light ahead that grows larger and larger
and larger, and that light becomes omnipresent,

198
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:25,300
almost, in size, a familiar grid of divine fire
and light. The Divine Gate, ancient and placed by

199
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,027
the gods to seal both them, the betrayer gods, and
any entities post-Divergence away. You transition

200
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:41,087
once more through this lattice, impacting, the
searing warmth just barely cresting the exterior

201
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:46,863
of your form, leaving no damage to your soul,
spirit, or physical body, but just enough to shake

202
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:52,344
you as you pass through one of these small, porous
holes in the gate itself. Glancing over your

203
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:56,804
shoulder, you can see small little sparks that
represent your friends who are traveling as well

204
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:02,740
through this planar tunnel. As the lattice of the
Divine Gate shifts and darkens behind you, you see

205
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,319
a secondary small blue doorway come rocketing
towards you all and suddenly your feet hit the

206
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:14,753
ground. And as your eyes focus and look around,
you are in the late afternoon, standing on the

207
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:23,848
dirt ground, familiar scent, of a crisp,
end-of-day Whitestone afternoon/evening. You guys

208
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:29,613
are not at the Sun Tree. You are by the southern
portion of it, not far from the farmhand who

209
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:36,190
commissioned your portrait, Jameson. But the city
is there before you. The streets aren't cluttered

210
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,071
with people.

211
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,160
LAURA: Not your portrait.

212
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,729
SAM: I don't know who that is.

213
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,611
MATT: Well, Scanlan. Sorry. We're still getting
over it.

214
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:46,160
TRAVIS: You know, that guy that played at your
father's whatever.

215
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,344
SAM: Yeah.

216
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:48,339
LAURA: Yeah.

217
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:53,254
MATT: So, as you all arrive, touch down, the
familiar scent. The smiles come over you, knowing

218
00:19:53,254 --> 00:20:00,246
that you've managed to successfully return to a
comfortable homestead. The sky is broken with

219
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:03,774
clouds. But you can still see some of the dark
blue behind it starting to turn purples and

220
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:09,879
oranges, as the sun, though out of sight, is
hitting dusk. A few people look over and glance

221
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,798
and you hear whispers as people begin to recognize
your arrival with a flashy spark of light and that

222
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,629
slight Terminator-like slow rise from a crouch
position as you all pull out of the other side of

223
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:19,450
the portal.

224
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,784
TRAVIS: (sings Terminator theme)

225
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:21,812
MATT: Yes.

226
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,436
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool.

227
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:24,857
LAURA: And we're all naked.

228
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,924
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,140
TALIESIN: Where is John Connor?

230
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,735
LIAM: Have you seen this boy?

231
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:29,733
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

232
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,052
MATT: No, you're fine. You're all still clothed.

233
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:34,497
TRAVIS: Fuuuu--

234
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:38,407
LAURA: All right. I had this feeling-- I felt like
we were not going to get here. I felt like we were

235
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,688
going to show up somewhere else. I don't know
why.

236
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:43,187
LIAM: This is a sight better than the Nine Hells.

237
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:48,807
TRAVIS: Could we have done that any closer to the
razor's edge? I'm just saying.

238
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,409
LAURA: Keyleth. Clutch.

239
00:20:52,409 --> 00:21:02,107
TALIESIN: I think all things considered, that went
rather well. Taryon? Are you all right? Are you

240
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,188
all right?

241
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,086
SAM: Yes. I'm fine.

242
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:09,464
TALIESIN: It is very reasonable not to be all
right after that. I think I'm going to need a

243
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,112
moment to sit down and have a drink--

244
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:11,922
TRAVIS: Yep.

245
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,221
LAURA: I pop Trinket out and I heal him.

246
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:14,696
MATT: Okay. Trinket pops out.

247
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,465
LAURA: Hey! We're safe!

248
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,356
TALIESIN: I pull out a bottle of something.

249
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:19,416
LAURA: It's good.

250
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,688
MATT: And immediately goes from 'fierce bear' to
'I'm hurting, help me, mommy.'

251
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:25,542
LAURA: I know. I'm going to do a spell, buddy.

252
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,321
MATT: Guard laid down, the bear is just rubbing
against you--

253
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:29,501
LAURA: I've got a level three. I'm going to do it
at level three.

254
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,602
MATT: Okay. The armor clinks and scrapes against
you as the bits of fur which are matted with its

255
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:42,368
own blood slowly heal as you touch the soft--
caress your fingers across the bear fur.

256
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,672
LAURA: Oh my god.

257
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:48,434
(laughter)

258
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:50,730
TALIESIN: Did you fail a petting a--

259
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,878
MATT: Three ones?

260
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,353
TRAVIS: Trip ones.

261
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,214
MATT: You finish healing Trinket, somewhat.

262
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,327
LAURA: I think I wasn't even supposed to get
three-- I'm only supposed to get two because it's

263
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:00,466
a level three.

264
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,554
TRAVIS: Well you still get two ones.

265
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,595
LAURA: Whatever.

266
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:03,567
MATT: Did you not have a third-level spell left?

267
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:04,783
LAURA: No, I do have a 3rd-level spell so it's--

268
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,848
MATT: So it's at third level--

269
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:06,715
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

270
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:10,365
MATT: It works. Yeah, you're fine. So you finish
healing. The wounds close somewhat and Trinket

271
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,363
goes, (questioning growl).

272
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:17,992
LAURA: I'm sorry. I feel a little shaken up from
that, I'm sorry. But you have some resting,

273
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:18,881
you know.

274
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:24,707
MATT: Licks the side of your cheek and is like--
(bear sounds) There is one 13-year-old kid off to

275
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:28,402
the side that's watching this whole thing go down
and just goes, "Is that your bear?"

276
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:33,531
LAURA: It is. Why? Do you want to pet him?

277
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:34,960
MATT: "No."

278
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,937
LAURA: Yes, you do. Trinket, go show some love.

279
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:40,785
LIAM: Slow, slow, don't scare the boy.

280
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:42,152
LAURA: Good-- Happy love.

281
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,156
MATT: The kid's trying to back up he's like, "Uh,
uh."

282
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,340
LAURA: I mean. Ooh--

283
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,042
TRAVIS: Don't run, don't run! He attacks with his
teeth if you run.

284
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:47,894
MATT: "Uh."

285
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:51,510
TRAVIS: Yeah, freeze. Nose up. Let him see your
nose hairs.

286
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,820
MATT: You can see this scrawny boy is frozen in
place and is partially trying to puff his chest

287
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,733
but also is-- you can see him fighting the
instinct to just run.

288
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,357
LIAM: If you hum to him, it soothes him.

289
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:09,202
MATT: (tentative humming) This little-- young
boy starts humming, and it's off-key but Trinket

290
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:10,488
walks up.

291
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:17,987
LAURA: No-- There it is.

292
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:22,121
MATT: You watch that moment the eyes just go open
wide and white before (slurps) up the side of the

293
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,248
boy's face.

294
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:25,313
LAURA: It's good that you hummed. It was really
good. It was good humming.

295
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,872
MATT: And then Trinket turns around and shoulder
checks him and knocks him onto his ass and walks

296
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,375
back to you.

297
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,588
TRAVIS: Good nose action.

298
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,610
LAURA: Yep.

299
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,146
MARISHA: 30 seconds back in Tal'Dorei and we're
tormenting people.

300
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,229
LAURA: No, no, no, he liked it. It was sweet.

301
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:37,525
MARISHA: That's us. That's good.

302
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,405
TRAVIS: Yeah.

303
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:39,462
TALIESIN: This trip has changed us.

304
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:40,473
TRAVIS: Human relations.

305
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:43,472
MARISHA: I'm not complaining, I very much approve.
Feels like old us.

306
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:46,378
LAURA: It's nice not to hear screams of torment at
all times.

307
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:52,220
LIAM: Guys, guys. We have fuck-all to do right
now. We have nothing to do.

308
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,075
What do you want to do?

309
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:56,693
TALIESIN: Well, we've got a robot to reconstruct.

310
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:57,521
TRAVIS: What?

311
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,582
LAURA: Oh, Tary.

312
00:23:58,582 --> 00:23:59,413
SAM: Yes.

313
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,234
TRAVIS: Oh.

314
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:02,205
TALIESIN: I'm going-- I will help with that. I've
got a very, very large--

315
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:03,808
LAURA: Are you all right?

316
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:11,693
SAM: I'm fine. You know, we-- adventurers lose
people in battle all the time, right? And we have

317
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:17,573
a-- it's nothing, right? It's totally normal. This
happens all the time, right?

318
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:20,672
LIAM: It's actually quite painful and the hurt
never goes away.

319
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:26,171
TALIESIN: I pass the last of the Green Tear
Whisky. For Dotty. Doty.

320
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,465
SAM: No.

321
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:29,589
TALIESIN: For Doty.

322
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:31,620
LAURA: (laughs) Dotty. D.T. Dotye.

323
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:42,899
SAM: No thank you, I'm not-- I don't know. I--
(sighs) He's-- I don't feel it would be right to

324
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,735
celebrate right now.

325
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,051
TALIESIN: This is not celebration.

326
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,579
TRAVIS: Yeah. How long did you have Do-oh-ty?

327
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:51,423
LAURA: Have you ever lost him before?

328
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,523
SAM: No.

329
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,127
LAURA: I'm sorry.

330
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,130
MARISHA: Have you lost anyone close to you
before?

331
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,109
SAM: No, I haven't.

332
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,508
MARISHA: Well then, you should know that that's
not celebration.

333
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:06,875
TALIESIN: This is acknowledgement.

334
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,109
LIAM: That's right.

335
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,468
SAM: All right.

336
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:12,275
MARISHA: This is coming to terms with a little bit
of help.

337
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:16,358
SAM: I'll take a sip to Doty. My best friend.

338
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,762
TALIESIN: Your oldest friend.

339
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:20,871
SAM: My only friend.

340
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:22,367
TALIESIN: Not anymore.

341
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,867
MARISHA: To Doty.

342
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,471
TALIESIN: Your oldest friend, not your only
friend.

343
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,297
TRAVIS: To the thing.

344
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:32,509
TALIESIN: When you're ready, we'll fix one up.

345
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:40,586
SAM: It won't be the same. I know it sounds silly,
but I created him. And he's just mechanical, but I

346
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:43,463
feel like he understood me better than anyone
else.

347
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:45,163
TALIESIN: No, that's not crazy.

348
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:47,236
LAURA: Well, he listened probably better than
anyone else.

349
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,451
SAM: But I could tell by his eyes that he sort of
got it, he understood. Maybe I was just

350
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:53,078
projecting, I don't know.

351
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:55,171
TALIESIN: Even if you were, it's--

352
00:25:55,171 --> 00:26:02,734
SAM: I suppose I could build another, it just
won't feel the same. I-- (sighs)

353
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:06,781
TALIESIN: How else will you chronicle Doty's
adventures if not with a new chronicler?

354
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:07,711
SAM: You're right.

355
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,930
MARISHA: Exactly. Doty will live on in your
stories.

356
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,200
TALIESIN: And we'll fill in everything that's been
missed.

357
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,307
SAM: Yes, you're right, you're right, yes. With
some resources and some time, and a little help,

358
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:23,303
maybe I can build a new Doty.

359
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:25,444
LAURA: Only when you're ready, dear.

360
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:28,192
TALIESIN: We definitely have resources, time, and
help.

361
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:33,489
LIAM: And also, don't need to party or anything,
but three cheers to you. You just survived hell

362
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:34,792
and back.

363
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,423
SAM: Yes. I did, didn't I?

364
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:38,052
LAURA: Was that on your list?

365
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:40,689
SAM: Hell was not, but a revenge plot was.

366
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:41,561
TRAVIS: Oh!

367
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,389
LAURA: Nice!

368
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:43,210
TRAVIS: Yeah!

369
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,276
SAM: And this was a revenge, so I think we can
tick that off. (sighs)

370
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:50,489
TRAVIS: How does it feel being such an
accomplished adventurer now?

371
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:59,428
SAM: Well, I've been giving that a lot of thought,
actually. In fact, if you will humor me, can I

372
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:01,608
read you all something?

373
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:03,678
LIAM: Yes. Percy, pass the bottle.

374
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:08,240
TALIESIN: Drag the last of all the bottles out
this time.

375
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,942
SAM: If we're honoring Doty, I'd love to read to
you the last thing that he wrote, well, transcribed

376
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:16,607
before we went into the Hells.

377
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,500
LAURA: I'm really excited to hear it.

378
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,685
MARISHA: That'd be beautiful.

379
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:31,712
SAM: As sort of a memorial to him. This was the
last page before. "Doty, take this down." He

380
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:38,441
always writes everything. "As I, Taryon
Darrington, embark on a mission into the very

381
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:43,612
"depths of hell, I do so with no fear or
hesitation. Though this undertaking is fraught

382
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:50,326
"with peril, I have a secret weapon that no
inferno, monster or hellhound can defeat. I am

383
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:57,101
"flanked by the ferocious band of mercenaries known
as Vox Machina. In the days since meeting this

384
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:04,240
"ragtag company, our relationship has blossomed. At
first, I was viewed as a suspicious outsider, then

385
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,714
"as a gallant and trusted colleague, and now,
having proven my mettle, accepted as a lifelong

386
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:16,283
"brother and full-fledged teammate. No matter what
we face in the Abyss, my comrades would risk their

387
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:24,067
"lives for me, kill for me, and I'm 100% sure each
would gladly give his or her life to save mine.

388
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:32,723
"Loyalty like that, you can't put a price on it.
But, if I had to, I'd say their friendship is

389
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:43,893
"worth about 210,000 gold. Which, even to me, is a
relatively large amount of money. Their faith

390
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,850
"emboldens me."

391
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,613
(laughter)

392
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,766
LIAM: This is out of character.

393
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:58,822
SAM: "But it's more than that. I've started to
wonder. If I have so easily won the confidence of

394
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:05,493
"these battled-hardened titans, perhaps I am even
more venerable, more impressive than I ever knew!

395
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:12,889
"Perhaps after this mission, I should return home,
newly confident, to confront my father once and

396
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:18,271
"for all. Maybe the time has come to complete my
journey here and show my family that I am indeed

397
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:25,868
"worthy to carry the Darrington name. But first,
revenge! Soon we will venture to where nightmares

398
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:32,805
"are born, and it's going to be fun, fun, fun.
That's all for now, Doty. As always, correct my

399
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:37,294
"grammatical errors before you rest and go fetch my
sleep mask and nightshirt."

400
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:40,417
And then we went to hell.

401
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:43,237
LAURA: That was beautiful. That was--

402
00:29:43,237 --> 00:29:46,183
TALIESIN: Eloquent, very eloquent.

403
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,975
SAM: He was a special, special robot and--

404
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:50,321
LAURA: Yes.

405
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,837
SAM: -- he was there for me in all of my darkest
times and lightest times and now that he's not

406
00:29:54,837 --> 00:30:03,393
there anymore, I just-- I should feel very
lonely, but I don't, because I am surrounded by

407
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:11,179
people who truly respect me for who I am. And I
know that in that last night before we went to the

408
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:19,436
Hells I wrote that I was ready, finally, to go
back and confront my father, but now in the

409
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:29,127
absence of Doty, I've decided to put that aside
and stay with you all. Yes, I feel my place is

410
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:36,060
here with you, my rightful place. I won't have
access to as much money, but everything else about

411
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:47,783
me will stay the same. And I know that you are all
happy that I've made this decision to stay with

412
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:55,989
you as a now-poor adventurer. So maybe this is
worth celebrating, I don't know, should we go have

413
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:58,296
a drink in a pub or something?

414
00:30:58,296 --> 00:30:59,996
LIAM: Yes, we should.

415
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,109
TALIESIN: We should, yes.

416
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,272
LIAM: Yes, we should.

417
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:03,307
MARISHA: Definitely.

418
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:06,168
TRAVIS: I have a question. What is a sleep mask?

419
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:11,481
SAM: I don't like seeing lights at night, it wakes
me out of my dream state, so--

420
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:13,324
TRAVIS: Does it go over your whole head?

421
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:17,586
SAM: Just my eyes and nose, just the top of the
nose.

422
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:27,260
LAURA: Just the smallest of questions, though. The
amount that you wrote down, would we be seeing

423
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,034
that before you cut off ties?

424
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:33,367
SAM: I don't think we should venture up there
right now.

425
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:37,977
LAURA: Right. Yeah.

426
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:42,972
SAM: We have adventuring to do, don't we? Things
to help rebuild, and--

427
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:45,999
LAURA: I mean, we may be here for a while.

428
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,149
TALIESIN: We may be taking a bit of a break.

429
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,252
LIAM: It was a funny moment in time when you met
us, Taryon.

430
00:31:51,252 --> 00:31:52,559
SAM: Yes?

431
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,782
LIAM: We had a bit of a list, we've had a couple
lists, and we've checked an awful lot off of them,

432
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:06,517
and we're real tired. We're thinking of taking it
easy for a bit.

433
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:10,685
LAURA: Wouldn't it be fun, though, to just set up
shop here and hang out--

434
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,393
LIAM: Tinker, design--

435
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:16,233
MARISHA: You could repair things for small change
on the side.

436
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:19,497
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's how you could make
some money, maybe tinker for a living.

437
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:26,032
SAM: Sure. I mean, I haven't tinkered for money
before, do you get, what, two, three thousand gold

438
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,513
per little--

439
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,153
TALIESIN: A year, yes.

440
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:30,276
SAM: Per year?

441
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:32,282
LAURA: Yeah, thereabouts.

442
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:35,155
TALIESIN: Well, tinkering, to be fair, I don't
actually know what tinkering pays because I've

443
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,250
never been paid to do it.

444
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,539
SAM: Is there anything that pays much, much more
than that?

445
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:43,449
MARISHA: Being a hero and adventuring or being
born into privilege.

446
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:44,697
LAURA: A lot of money.

447
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,910
TALIESIN: A lot of money.

448
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,903
SAM: But you know what? I'm ready to set aside
money for now, and just live my life and be my own

449
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:57,924
man. Because if I do, when I do eventually go
home, I don't want to seem like I'm trying to

450
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:04,449
prove something to him. I just want to be my own
man, right? And have him accept me for that, like

451
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,704
you all have.

452
00:33:05,704 --> 00:33:07,848
TALIESIN: Well... I mean, yes.

453
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,428
TRAVIS: I know there's a lot of money in being a
man whore.

454
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:11,533
SAM: A man whore?

455
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:15,642
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sell your body, you know? Put that
hair to good use.

456
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:16,880
LAURA: That is true, Taryon.

457
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,056
TRAVIS: Start making some coin.

458
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,145
LAURA: You are a pretty boy.

459
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,151
LIAM: It's true.

460
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,177
SAM: My hair.

461
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:23,563
TALIESIN: You don't actually have to listen to a
man who needed an eye mask

462
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:25,947
explained to him, but--

463
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:28,499
SAM: Who will brush my hair at night?

464
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:32,007
TALIESIN: Well, that's a conundrum.

465
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:35,413
LAURA: Well, you know, you could make a new Doty,
maybe a smaller Doty, just to brush hair.

466
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,386
SAM: Yes, I will. Will you help me?

467
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:38,628
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

468
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:46,411
MARISHA: Plus, you know, if you're wanting to
become a more independent and solitary man, then

469
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:52,132
maybe you learn how to brush your own hair.

470
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:55,150
SAM: As always, wise words, Keyleth.

471
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,725
MARISHA: Thank you.

472
00:33:56,725 --> 00:34:00,006
TALIESIN: Hell has done something to you.

473
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:05,758
LIAM: Also, we feel very badly about Doty,
obviously, and I hope that you can build a

474
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:14,436
replacement, but in all the years that you were
with him, did you ever have a sweetheart or an

475
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:16,701
acquaintance, even?

476
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:24,633
SAM: Nothing to speak of.

477
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:30,201
LIAM: I mean, if you can push yourself to go to
the Nine Hells, you can go out to a tavern with us

478
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,848
and meet people.

479
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:36,607
LAURA: That's right, get a little funsy action
there.

480
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,251
SAM: Are you talking about intercourse?

481
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:43,998
TALIESIN: Well, at the very least we're talking
about advanced flirting, at the very least.

482
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,463
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that's good.

483
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:50,251
MARISHA: Courtship. And Vax over here is a great
wingman. Get it? Because he's--

484
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:53,704
SAM: I could try that out, sure, yeah, that's a
great idea. Yes!

485
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:54,991
TRAVIS: Try that out?

486
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,074
MARISHA: Thank you!

487
00:34:56,074 --> 00:35:05,497
LIAM: Do you-- this is forward, do you go rogue or
ranger, or-- Taco or hot dog, or--

488
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:08,715
SAM: I do not understand what you are saying.

489
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:11,619
TALIESIN: I suppose if there's liquor, we could
find out!

490
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,050
SAM: Rogue or ranger!

491
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,876
TRAVIS: You know what, we're going to find out,
right? Let's just roll the dice

492
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:20,022
and see where they fall.

493
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:22,675
LIAM: We've got to teach you some slang, buddy.
You've got to learn some slang.

494
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:24,226
SAM: All right, all right! Yes, let's go!

495
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:27,758
LAURA: No, but seriously, though, the money
situation though, like, really, you are paying--

496
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,312
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's okay.

497
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:34,352
LAURA: No, but, you know, you always said you pay
your debts and all that, so you have some, so I

498
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:36,221
just wanted to make sure that that's actually
happening.

499
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,276
LIAM: Maybe we could get to that tomorrow.

500
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:42,128
LAURA: No, because I feel really bad for you, I
feel bad about everything, and I'm pretty happy

501
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,244
for you for being your own man and all of that, I
just want to make sure that--

502
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:51,696
SAM: No, it's fine. I could probably figure out
how much I currently have. It's just, Doty used to

503
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:54,016
keep track of that for me.

504
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:56,900
LAURA: I can keep track of it for you, gladly!

505
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,559
LIAM: Can I insight him to see if this is
bullshit, or legitimate tears?

506
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:01,781
MATT: Sure.

507
00:36:01,781 --> 00:36:04,714
LIAM: I'm outta Luck, too. Hold on, hold on.

508
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:06,058
TALIESIN: That's so exciting.

509
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:07,256
SAM: Do I have to roll against it?

510
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,408
MATT: Just roll, just roll.

511
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:09,626
LIAM: Oh, it's terrible.

512
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,489
SAM: This is worse.

513
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:11,249
TRAVIS: No, there's no way.

514
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:12,026
LAURA: Doubtful. What did you get?

515
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:12,905
SAM: This is three.

516
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:13,801
LIAM: Five!

517
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,229
SAM: What are we rolling?

518
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:16,702
LAURA: Wait, what did you add? What did you add to
him?

519
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:19,770
MATT: Persuasion if you're honest, deception if
you're not. Don't tell me which one it is.

520
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:25,048
LIAM: But then tell the number.

521
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:26,685
SAM: Oh! Five.

522
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,800
LAURA: Five and five! What does that mean?

523
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,277
MATT: Five and five? It meets the DC, so tell
him.

524
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:35,931
SAM: I have 34,000 gold pieces.

525
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:40,290
LAURA: I thought you said you had a lot of money!

526
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,841
(laughter)

527
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:46,689
MARISHA: She said, out of accent, appalled.

528
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:48,744
LAURA: Because I'm completely out of character!

529
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:49,981
LIAM: Where's my money, Taryon?

530
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,291
MARISHA: She's so incensed, she dropped accent!

531
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,643
LAURA: Okay, no, no, I wasn't Vex then!

532
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,601
MARISHA: Yeah!

533
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:58,103
MATT: So Vax, here's how it works. In character,
Vax, you get the sense that--

534
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:01,938
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, Vex or Vax?

535
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:06,050
MATT: Vax, because you're the one who read this.
As all this is happening, you get the sense that

536
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,061
maybe he's not currently worth as much as he leads
on.

537
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:15,127
LIAM: I was also curious if the tears felt like
crocodile tears, or--

538
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:19,762
SAM: Oh, just at that last moment?

539
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:21,514
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah, were you really, like--

540
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,209
SAM: I just didn't want to tell her how money I
have--

541
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,288
LIAM: Right, so it's bullshit.

542
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:27,499
SAM: -- but before, I'm genuinely sad about Doty!

543
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,583
LIAM: Absolutely, but in this moment, a little
bullshitty.

544
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,199
MATT: In this moment, a little bullshitty, I
think.

545
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,466
SAM: Yes.

546
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:34,216
LAURA: I didn't read any of that.

547
00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:38,735
LIAM: We can talk about this tomorrow. Let's just
go get him drunk, he'll probably tell you if he's

548
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:42,657
drunk. I'm sorry, you're right in front of me.
Let's go have a drink!

549
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:46,580
MARISHA: Are we still in the middle of farmlands,
or are we walking?

550
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,350
MATT: You guys are in the street, so you're slowly
walking through the streets of Whitestone.

551
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,332
MARISHA: All right, okay.

552
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:53,315
MATT: If you're looking for a pub in particular,
the one you usually go to is the Tipsy Quorum, if

553
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,697
that's where you're going to get a drink.

554
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:55,599
LAURA: That's my favorite.

555
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,585
TRAVIS: I always forget the name.

556
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:57,693
MARISHA: Old faithful.

557
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,819
TALIESIN: It's the best bars where you always
forget the name, isn't it?

558
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,595
TRAVIS: Yep!

559
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:01,321
LAURA: Yeah.

560
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:05,054
MATT: On the way, because this is on the more
northern side, northeastern side of Whitestone,

561
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:11,915
you do see there is a crowd of people. What looks
to be a caravan is being packed up. There are a

562
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:18,638
number of carts and horses and things are being
loaded up for what looks to be some sort of a

563
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:28,377
fairly large travel pack of people. You do hear
the laughter of children coming from the right of

564
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:34,011
you, and then pushing through the crowd, you see
Odessa, Illya, and Gren Tal'Dorei, the children,

565
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:42,541
go running past as they're being chased by two
aasimar boys, blue skin, running past them, and

566
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:46,321
they're giving a joking chase tickle. And all of a
sudden one of the kids comes around with a stick,

567
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:50,461
and he stops and puts his hands up, and they all
look over and see you guys and immediately get

568
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:58,500
sheepish with their hands to the side. You see
Kyor nods, and Hunin nods, the kids go running off

569
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,451
again, not really paying attention to you guys--

570
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:01,765
LAURA: Well, go get 'em!

571
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:06,646
MATT: "Uh-huh!" They both continue off after the
kids just as Salda Tal'Dorei walks up from between

572
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:10,604
some of the Pale Guard that are currently helping
load things onto these carts. And she sees you

573
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:15,541
all, and comes forth, "Oh, my goodness! It's so
great to see you all safe and sound!"

574
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,443
TALIESIN: Your majesty.

575
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:18,458
MARISHA: Hello.

576
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,503
MATT: The last few times you've seen her, she's
looked a little frazzled but still with what

577
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:25,788
remains of her formal attire which she had on her
after the attack on Tal'Dorei. Right now, she's

578
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:31,693
dressed very simply. You wouldn't be able to tell
her from most of the regular casual farmfolk, and

579
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:37,576
you would have no instinct of the noble lifestyle that
she comes from, and it suits her well. She smiles

580
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:50,974
and greets, and gives a respectful bow. "So we're
heading back to Emon."

581
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,838
LAURA: They'll be happy to have you.

582
00:39:53,838 --> 00:40:01,505
MATT: "It's been a while, and now that things have
calmed down, and from what we've heard that you've

583
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:11,520
"all saved the city, I guess, we're going to bring
the children back to their home. We're going to be

584
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,645
"taking the Parchwood Way to the Silvercut Roadway,
and we have guardians, we have people we've hired

585
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:27,922
"or have agreed to come along and keep us safe. The
children have taken a shine to the boys, as if you

586
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:32,763
"haven't noticed. If it's all right, we're thinking
of bringing them with us."

587
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,956
LAURA: That's wonderful.

588
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:37,676
MARISHA: It's very kind of you.

589
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,063
TALIESIN: Quite gracious.

590
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:44,088
MATT: "We have the Alabaster Lyceum-- once it's up
and running again, of course-- and I know the

591
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:48,831
"headmaster there. We can provide a good education
for the boys, which, upon talking with them, I

592
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:51,440
"think they're both in dire need of."

593
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,760
LAURA: Do you need any help with that? We feel a
bit of responsibility for them.

594
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:06,099
MATT: "Really, it's fine. You guys have done
enough anyway, and to be honest, I believe your

595
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:10,837
"sister needs your help here more than we could on
the journey there."

596
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:14,503
LIAM: Do your kids-- holding up okay?

597
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:23,899
MATT: "Yeah. We've done as best as we could to
shield them from the brunt of the past few months,

598
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:32,618
"but things are cheerier here, definitely, and I
think they've

599
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,432
"taken that upon themselves as well."

600
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:43,062
MARISHA: Just be prepared, the Emon you left isn't
necessarily the Emon you'll be returning to. It's

601
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:45,073
getting better, but it takes time.

602
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:52,759
MATT: "I can assure you that my memory of the
place, at least the moments before we left,

603
00:41:52,759 --> 00:42:03,429
"couldn't be any more dire than we could return to.
Any semblance of calm at our home is welcome.

604
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:12,320
"But--" and she glances over-- "I think Odessa has
a crush on Hunin. I don't want to break her heart

605
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,359
"by keeping them too far away, so that's--"

606
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,847
LIAM: Cool mom.

607
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:25,882
MATT: "Anyway, I think we're preparing to set out
first thing in the morning, and I just want to say

608
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:28,285
"thank you for everything."

609
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:34,088
LAURA: Any time. Sorry we couldn't do more.

610
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:44,463
MATT: "You've done plenty. I do hope to see you if
you decide to still be a part of the Council,

611
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:46,352
"satellite or not."

612
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:48,554
LAURA: Grayskull is still there!

613
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:54,424
MATT: "Well, I mean, the children shouldn't be too
far, then! Anyway, I should go catch up to them.

614
00:42:54,424 --> 00:42:56,750
"It's good to see you all."

615
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,295
TALIESIN: It's good to see you as well.

616
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,626
MATT: She glances over at you with a curious
look.

617
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:01,779
SAM: Good day.

618
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,153
MATT: "Good day."

619
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:05,904
TALIESIN: He's new, but he's proving himself quite
well.

620
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:07,186
MARISHA: He's fine.

621
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,226
SAM: I just lost my best friend.

622
00:43:09,226 --> 00:43:11,660
MARISHA: He's fine.

623
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,261
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible. I
understand the difficulty of loss,

624
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,405
"believe you me."

625
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:22,307
SAM: Does it get better?

626
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:33,844
MATT: "It does. With people like this around you,
people like them around me, it does."

627
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:36,472
SAM: Thank you, kind stranger.

628
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:43,534
MATT: "You as well, kind stranger." She continues
walking on and catches up with the kids.

629
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:45,259
SAM: She seems neat.

630
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:53,546
TALIESIN: Yes, neat. Neat would be the word I
would-- she does all right.

631
00:43:53,546 --> 00:44:00,564
MARISHA: That's the most awkward post-conversation
conversation I have ever had.

632
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:02,740
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty awkward.

633
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,140
TALIESIN: Well, there's a pub over there.

634
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,500
LAURA: Let's go get him laid.

635
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,441
TALIESIN: Do I see a soldier of any kind, on
this--

636
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,218
MATT: Oh yeah, there's a number of Pale Guard that
have been assigned to this caravan that are

637
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,226
helping put things onto the various carts.

638
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:18,593
TALIESIN: I'm just tapping one. When you're done,
please let the palace know that we have returned.

639
00:44:18,593 --> 00:44:23,834
MATT: "Oh, yes, of course, sir. It will be done."

640
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:29,986
TALIESIN: We've returned for good, for a while, so
no immediate threat anymore.

641
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:31,711
TRAVIS: We went to hell.

642
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,494
MATT: "I will do this. I will do this
immediately."

643
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:35,997
MARISHA: (yells) We'll be in the pub!

644
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:38,219
(laughter)

645
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,394
MATT: "Right." He finishes putting one of the last
bags up and then starts making his way up towards

646
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:48,702
Castle Whitestone. You guys continue your foot
journey over to the tavern.

647
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:52,333
LAURA: I get on my broom and continue the
journey.

648
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:59,117
LIAM: Had a little too much of Percy's hooch?
What's the matter?

649
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:09,584
MATT: As you guys start making your way towards
the tavern, you hear a series of heavy metallic

650
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:16,627
footfalls behind you with accelerated pace,
quickening, quickening. And you glance over your

651
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:22,098
shoulder and rushing from the caravan, apparently
in the process of helping it being set up and part

652
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:27,875
of the party that brought or is spearheading the
organization of this caravan, you see a small

653
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,293
gnomish cleric in plate armor.

654
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:36,470
(cheering)

655
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,591
ASHLEY: Hello!

656
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:39,475
MATT: Come on in!

657
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:41,707
LIAM: She's back, baby! She's back!

658
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:47,894
ASHLEY: Ah! Hello, everybody!

659
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:50,691
MATT: This is in character, by the way.

660
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:52,910
MARISHA: How was traffic?

661
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,346
ASHLEY: Oh, hi! Oh, just so terrible!

662
00:45:55,346 --> 00:45:56,981
MARISHA: With the caravan!

663
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,473
ASHLEY: Hello, everybody!

664
00:45:58,473 --> 00:45:59,443
LAURA: Hi!

665
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:00,634
ASHLEY: Hi!

666
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:05,981
MATT: So Pike, having come along, as you've been
helping out with the reconstruction effort in Emon

667
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:11,998
and was notified that some of the remaining royals
of the family of the Sovereign were going to make

668
00:46:11,998 --> 00:46:16,034
their way towards Emon, the least you could do was
be a part of that. So you ushered a number of the

669
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:21,741
travel carts that were intended for this part of
the caravan, since Whitestone had to maintain most

670
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:28,246
of their hardware within the city to remain
functional, and you just arrived in the city a few

671
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:35,384
days ago, and as you've been helping these people
prepare and organize the whole endeavor, you just

672
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:40,650
watch Vox Machina, your family, walk by and start
making their way towards one of the taverns just

673
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,274
as the sun's setting. And you rush up to catch up
with them.

674
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,536
ASHLEY: Hey! Hey! You're just going to walk by?

675
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,245
LAURA: We didn't even see you! Oh my god!

676
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:49,786
ASHLEY: Oh, hi. Oh, hey! Hey!

677
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:55,533
TRAVIS: Oh, man, Pike! Look! Look who it is!

678
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,851
ASHLEY: Hi, hello Taryon.

679
00:46:57,851 --> 00:46:59,387
SAM: Hello, Pike.

680
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:00,480
ASHLEY: Hello.

681
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,823
SAM: Hello. Hello.

682
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:05,390
MARISHA: We're so sorry, we know you really wanted
to go to the Hells with us--

683
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,517
LAURA: We went to hell.

684
00:47:06,517 --> 00:47:08,493
MARISHA: -- but we couldn't wait, so we had to go.
We're so sorry.

685
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,655
ASHLEY: I heard.

686
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:10,977
LIAM: It was awful. You would not have liked it.

687
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:16,057
ASHLEY: I imagine it's awful, and I just think I
was a little nervous about going there, because I

688
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:18,943
don't know how that would affect me.

689
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:22,686
SAM: Oh, that seems like a justification, sure.

690
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:23,848
LAURA: Really?

691
00:47:23,848 --> 00:47:25,548
ASHLEY: Just selfishly speaking, I feel like maybe
it wouldn't have been good.

692
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,403
TRAVIS: Like what? Like, you would have gone dark
Pike or something?

693
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:28,775
LAURA: It probably would have been-- Like, you
would have gone evil-evil?

694
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:32,337
ASHLEY: Maybe? I feel like it would have affected
me in certain ways, or, you know,

695
00:47:32,337 --> 00:47:34,135
I just don't know!

696
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:35,418
MARISHA: It was very hot!

697
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,232
TRAVIS: That's not a risk we want to take.

698
00:47:37,282 --> 00:47:38,920
ASHLEY: No, it's probably safe that I didn't.

699
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,033
LAURA: That's true, you would have been really hot
in your armor.

700
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,782
MARISHA: Yeah, it made my cheeks really red.

701
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,070
TALIESIN: We may have eaten some souls.

702
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,258
ASHLEY: You have a little bit of a glow!

703
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:46,004
MARISHA: Really?

704
00:47:46,004 --> 00:47:47,096
LAURA: Percy ate a soul!

705
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:48,645
ASHLEY: You ate a soul? What did it taste like?

706
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:50,098
TRAVIS: Why would you even volunteer that?

707
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:50,759
TALIESIN: Well--

708
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,080
LAURA: Percy signed a contract with a devil!

709
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,539
TALIESIN: Well, I may have signed a contract with
a devil.

710
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,917
ASHLEY: Percy. What do you mean?

711
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,500
TALIESIN: Well, we were in hell, it's just--

712
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,021
TRAVIS: It's just what you do!

713
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:01,140
ASHLEY: When in hell--

714
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,097
LIAM: You go to a casino in Marquet, you gamble.
You go to hell--

715
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,468
LAURA: You go to hell, you sign a contract!

716
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,178
TALIESIN: You sign a contract with a devil, I'm
never going to do anything with it.

717
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,603
ASHLEY: What is it?

718
00:48:11,603 --> 00:48:18,533
TALIESIN: Honestly, it was mostly just to take
care of our little problem, and in return, I have

719
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,711
the option of--

720
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,065
LAURA: Selling his soul.

721
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:26,024
TALIESIN: -- selling my soul for power that I
don't really need, because I have everything I

722
00:48:26,024 --> 00:48:27,329
need right here.

723
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:29,986
TRAVIS: Did we even tell her why we went to hell?

724
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:30,973
TALIESIN: She knows why went to hell.

725
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:31,896
ASHLEY: I know why.

726
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:32,874
TRAVIS: Oh. Hey!

727
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:38,244
ASHLEY: And I think, word on the street is that
you completed that mission.

728
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:39,534
LAURA: We did, we did.

729
00:48:39,534 --> 00:48:40,735
TALIESIN: Yes.

730
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:41,946
TRAVIS: The word on the street?

731
00:48:41,946 --> 00:48:43,282
MARISHA: We went kitten-smushing.

732
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:45,423
LAURA: She scries, she sees shit.

733
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:52,036
ASHLEY: I just heard on the street from that guy.
He just told me what just happened. It's crazy.

734
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:55,494
(laughter)

735
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:57,943
MARISHA: A newsie runs by--

736
00:48:57,943 --> 00:48:59,386
TRAVIS: Screaming in terror.

737
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:00,979
LAURA: We're about to get some alcohol, do you
want to join us?

738
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:01,857
ASHLEY: Perfect timing! Perfect timing.

739
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:02,786
TALIESIN: Extra, extra!

740
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:03,863
MARISHA: Read all about it!

741
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:06,528
ASHLEY: If you guys don't mind, just pick up the
rest of the carts, all of it. I haven't seen them

742
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:07,928
in so long.

743
00:49:07,928 --> 00:49:09,587
LAURA: All the carts.

744
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:10,584
MATT: "Of course."

745
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:11,793
TALIESIN: She's being commandeered.

746
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:12,624
LAURA: Yeah.

747
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:14,379
MATT: "Yes. All right, we'll continue. You've done
your work for the day."

748
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:15,952
LAURA: Important business of state.

749
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,794
ASHLEY: Okay. So much stuff to do and discuss.

750
00:49:18,794 --> 00:49:20,100
LAURA: Yeah, it's really important.

751
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,539
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yup.

752
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:26,918
MATT: You get the sense from the guard that he
probably wasn't introduced to you before, doesn't

753
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:30,247
know who you are, and figured a gnome probably
wouldn't be very helpful putting things into a

754
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:35,366
cart very high up, so what slight hint of racism
you might have caught in the undertone of his

755
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:37,024
statement, you're like, whatever, it's fine.

756
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:41,028
ASHLEY: Whatever. He was just a little bit rude to
me, so I don't really mind.

757
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:42,227
TRAVIS: Who was?

758
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:43,508
ASHLEY: It's fine, don't be mad.

759
00:49:43,508 --> 00:49:46,577
TRAVIS: Who? Just point him out! Point him out. He
doesn't need his ears anymore.

760
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:48,943
LIAM: He's just set in his ways.

761
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:52,517
ASHLEY: I just feel like he wasn't very
appreciative, and I was working very hard.

762
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:54,872
TRAVIS: You probably were! I see sweat!

763
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,439
ASHLEY: And you know how strong I am!

764
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:58,376
TRAVIS: You're real strong!

765
00:49:58,376 --> 00:49:59,309
LAURA: You're so strong!

766
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:03,898
ASHLEY: What I lack in height, I make up for in
strength.

767
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:05,168
LAURA: That's right.

768
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,467
LIAM: Show us the guns.

769
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:10,035
LAURA: You could beat me in an arm wrestling
match! They're huge.

770
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:11,717
TRAVIS: Those are pythons.

771
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,865
ASHLEY: Let's go drink!

772
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:13,757
MARISHA: Yeah!

773
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:14,576
LIAM: Yeah.

774
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:18,041
LAURA: Oh, I'm so sorry. Taryon lost his best
friend.

775
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,282
ASHLEY: Oh. Who was your best--

776
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:22,295
LAURA: The big creepy robot that drew us.

777
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:24,337
ASHLEY: Oh, no, Tary.

778
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:30,733
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, it's rough. It's rough. But these
fellows have told me that they're going to take my

779
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:33,151
mind off it with some flirting tonight.

780
00:50:33,151 --> 00:50:34,086
LAURA: Yeah.

781
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:35,242
ASHLEY: With some flirting!

782
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,547
SAM: Yes. Yes.

783
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,412
ASHLEY: Ooh, flirting can take your mind off lots
of things.

784
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,956
TALIESIN: That's so true.

785
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,621
ASHLEY: Do you have someone in mind that you're
going to flirt with?

786
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,379
SAM: I don't know, I--

787
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,900
LIAM: Yes, what's his or her name?

788
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,886
SAM: I assume you're going to introduce me to
someone?

789
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:57,032
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we'll find somebody good.
Super, super good.

790
00:50:57,032 --> 00:50:58,647
TRAVIS: We'll case the landscape.

791
00:50:58,647 --> 00:50:59,798
LIAM: If you tell us--

792
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:01,797
MARISHA: Wait, do we know people other than
ourselves?

793
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:02,638
TRAVIS: Nope.

794
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:04,038
TALIESIN: We do, we know lots of people.

795
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:06,217
LAURA: Here? We know Gilmore, he flirts really
good.

796
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:07,434
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we know Gilmore!

797
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:10,964
SAM: Anyone you point out to me, I'm pretty sure I
can woo.

798
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:11,915
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

799
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:13,153
LAURA: Okay.

800
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,272
LIAM: Well, let's put your best foot forward.

801
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:16,279
SAM: Sure.

802
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:18,367
LIAM: What should we be looking for?

803
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,322
SAM: Someone attractive--

804
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:20,142
LIAM: Yes.

805
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:20,921
LAURA: Right.

806
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:24,870
SAM: -- someone who can have an intellectual
conversation--

807
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,417
LIAM: Let's just talk aesthetics, because once you
get into it, then you get to know the person.

808
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,743
TRAVIS: Yeah, what's your type?

809
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:31,701
LIAM: This person, what does this person look
like? Does this person--

810
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:33,325
SAM: Tall. Strong.

811
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:34,691
LAURA: Okay. Yeah.

812
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,740
SAM: Fair-skinned.

813
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,837
LAURA: Ooh, okay.

814
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:37,834
TALIESIN: Basically Grog, so far.

815
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:38,630
SAM: That's about it.

816
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,340
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want Grog?

817
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,843
SAM: Oh, heavens no.

818
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:43,508
TRAVIS: What do you mean, no?

819
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:45,781
LIAM: That is a lot of man.

820
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:55,829
SAM: I mean, you're perfectly attractive to some
people, I'm sure, but you're just not my type, I

821
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,095
suppose?

822
00:51:57,095 --> 00:51:57,904
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

823
00:51:57,904 --> 00:51:58,954
LAURA: Too muscly? Too bald.

824
00:51:58,954 --> 00:52:00,054
TRAVIS: No accounting for taste.

825
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,420
LAURA: Too much body odor. Which one?

826
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,567
SAM: All of those things.

827
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:03,348
LAURA: Got it.

828
00:52:03,348 --> 00:52:04,258
TALIESIN: All right.

829
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:05,240
TRAVIS: I do have a lot of those things.

830
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,379
LAURA: So someone more like Keyleth would be
along-- someone lithe and sculpted.

831
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:14,932
SAM: I should be so lucky to have a mate as
capable as Keyleth.

832
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:15,872
TRAVIS: A mate.

833
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:17,117
LAURA: Oh. That was really uncomfortable.

834
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:18,754
TALIESIN: That was an interesting word, yeah, that
just brought the whole thing.

835
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:21,469
MARISHA: Yeah, you're knocking this flirting 
thing right out of the park.

836
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,219
SAM: Don't worry, I can hold my own.

837
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,444
TRAVIS: You know what, best to just throw him to
the wolves. Let's just get after it.

838
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:27,466
SAM: I'll be fine.

839
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:28,827
TALIESIN: Well, not literal wolves.

840
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:32,301
ASHLEY: And maybe just don't go right to "mate,"
you know, "you're my mate" right from the get-go,

841
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:33,469
because that might freak somebody out.

842
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:35,577
LAURA: Yeah, or, "I want to mate with you." That's
probably bad as well.

843
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:38,403
MARISHA: Just don't use the word "mate," not even
in the buddy sense.

844
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,482
SAM: All right. Okay.

845
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:40,575
TALIESIN: Yeah, "you're my mate."

846
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,462
MARISHA: "You're my mate."

847
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:42,511
LAURA: That's okay, that's all right.

848
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:43,613
SAM: I'm feeling confident.

849
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:44,503
LAURA: That's good.

850
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:49,026
SAM: Remember, I'm a Darrington. I can walk into
any establishment and find a young lass who has

851
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:51,629
heard of me and take her home for the night.

852
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:52,504
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

853
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:53,467
LIAM: There it is.

854
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:54,398
TRAVIS: Good, good, okay.

855
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:55,584
ASHLEY: Well, there it is. That's what we're
looking for.

856
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:56,491
LAURA: All right, cool, that's good, yeah, that's
good.

857
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:57,406
TALIESIN: I felt pretty good on that one.

858
00:52:57,406 --> 00:52:58,274
MARISHA: Hard cut!

859
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:00,661
(laughter)

860
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:02,161
SAM: Can we do that? Is that something you can
do?

861
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:03,522
TRAVIS: Smash cut to--

862
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:04,796
TALIESIN: It's Dungeons & Dragons, man!

863
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:06,611
LAURA: Rejection, rejection, rejection!

864
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:09,465
MATT: The best montage ever.

865
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:10,422
TALIESIN: Roll for montage.

866
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:12,269
MARISHA: Roll for montage!

867
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:21,517
MATT: As you guys make your way into the Tipsy
Quorum, the warm interior is comfortable to you

868
00:53:21,517 --> 00:53:25,969
guys. You recall most of it, as most of the time
you've spent in there has been in various states

869
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:32,074
of intoxication. There's a beautiful hearth on the
north end of the complex. I say "complex" because

870
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:36,661
it's a series of rooms. There's the main tavern
area in which the drinking happens. There's a

871
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:41,133
small eating area that's separate from that, so
they keep the localized tavern central area on its

872
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:45,637
own. There's a kitchen, an open kitchen, so all
the smoke and the food smell comes just barreling

873
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:50,022
through. It's pretty sparse, mainly because a lot
of the people are in the process of helping with

874
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:53,572
the tavern, or they just haven't quite hit that
point in the evening. Dusk is when people start

875
00:53:53,572 --> 00:53:57,475
finishing their work for the day, and they usually
come in in the next couple hours or so. But you do

876
00:53:57,475 --> 00:54:02,463
see a couple of the Pale Guard are currently just
taking a break. There's a handful of farmhands

877
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:06,780
that are just in there, finishing a small
breakfast and having some drinks. There's the

878
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:14,892
bartender and a few bar handlers, a barmaid just
waiting for customers to come in. And as you

879
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:21,414
enter, immediately she goes from leaning on the
back wall. "Oh, hah, sorry!" And she comes up and

880
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:25,203
shows you guys to-- "Any table you like!"

881
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:27,817
LAURA: What does she look like?

882
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:41,661
MATT: She looks late 40s, probably had a few kids.
She's not unattractive, she's not going to be

883
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:47,070
blowing anyone's mind, per se-- she's a working
woman, she's confident, it seems, and she knows

884
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,559
her job. She's a lady.

885
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,200
LAURA: You've got a good shot over there with
that--

886
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,872
TRAVIS: (loudly) Do you have food and drink in
this establishment?

887
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:54,900
LAURA: She's a female.

888
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,014
MATT: "We got both!"

889
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:57,415
TRAVIS: Do you have turkey legs?

890
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:58,406
TALIESIN: Halfway there already.

891
00:54:58,406 --> 00:54:59,165
MATT: "Turkey legs?"

892
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,112
TRAVIS: Turkey legs.

893
00:55:00,112 --> 00:55:02,411
MATT: "We got the best turkey legs in
Whitestone."

894
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:04,192
ASHLEY: Ooh!

895
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:09,738
TRAVIS: Shit, the gauntlet has been thrown down. I
need two turkey legs for each one of these

896
00:55:09,738 --> 00:55:11,256
beautiful people here.

897
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:13,769
LAURA: We really do, that sounds really good.

898
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,615
MATT: "Coming right up." And she boops you on the
nose, turns around, and walks right back towards

899
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,163
the kitchen area.

900
00:55:19,163 --> 00:55:20,162
LAURA: Did she just boop you on the nose?

901
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:21,633
TRAVIS: She booped me on the fucking nose.

902
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:24,219
LIAM: Man, though, I want to be at Ren Faire right
now.

903
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,471
LAURA: She booped-- I know!!

904
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:29,518
TRAVIS: Just put one Grog, zero for Tary, because
that's happening later.

905
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:32,001
SAM: You and her?

906
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:33,128
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

907
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,032
LAURA: He got booped.

908
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:36,494
TRAVIS: You've got to start claiming them now,
because once Grog starts putting the vibe out,

909
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,342
they just come running.

910
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,665
ASHLEY: I have an idea.

911
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:40,451
SAM: All right.

912
00:55:40,451 --> 00:55:41,099
TALIESIN: Oh no.

913
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,223
ASHLEY: What if we have a contest?

914
00:55:42,223 --> 00:55:42,856
TALIESIN: Oh no!

915
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:43,494
MARISHA: Oh no.

916
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:44,373
SAM: Great!

917
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:45,897
ASHLEY: Whoever takes her home--

918
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:46,526
TALIESIN: Oh no!

919
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,033
LAURA: Oh my.

920
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:48,619
MARISHA: Oh no!

921
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,993
ASHLEY: -- or just-- I don't like having a woman
be a part of a contest. That sounds terrible.

922
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:52,181
SAM: No, no, no, let's follow this thread.

923
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:54,611
ASHLEY: I just mean-- I'm not trying to--

924
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:57,138
LIAM: Tell us more, holy hooligan, tell us more.

925
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:58,076
LAURA: I'm not trying to--

926
00:55:58,076 --> 00:55:59,556
TRAVIS: Moral compass.

927
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,250
ASHLEY: Moral compass! I'm not--

928
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,145
TALIESIN: She's an imaginary woman on graph paper.
Roll for it.

929
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:07,539
SAM: How about, spend the evening with? Spend the
evening with.

930
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,785
LAURA: No, it's still the same thing!

931
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:09,737
ASHLEY: It's still the same thing.

932
00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:11,464
SAM: Well, no, no, no, it could be talking, it
could be--

933
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:12,797
ASHLEY: Maybe I've become terrible.

934
00:56:12,797 --> 00:56:14,348
TRAVIS: What about win the affections of?

935
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:15,813
ASHLEY: Win the affections of.

936
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:17,218
TALIESIN: Get a kiss from.

937
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:18,314
SAM: Of that young lady?

938
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,534
LIAM: Who she likes better.

939
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:23,236
MARISHA: Maybe we need all these stipulations.
Whoever chugs a pint the quickest.

940
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:24,357
ASHLEY: Yeah.

941
00:56:24,357 --> 00:56:25,842
SAM: All right, I like this. No, no, no, I like
this.

942
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:26,624
ASHLEY: Okay.

943
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:28,724
LIAM: Who she likes better, and Pickle's the
judge, that's easy to do.

944
00:56:28,724 --> 00:56:29,550
SAM: All right.

945
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,435
TALIESIN: And then if she rejects both of them, we
all win.

946
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,220
SAM: But let's make this interesting.

947
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,556
MARISHA: Man, that seems hyper subjective, based
on someone's internal monologue that we can

948
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:38,407
definitely not hear.

949
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:42,246
TRAVIS: Hold on, I've piqued Tary's interest over
there.

950
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:46,522
SAM: Yes, I like this, I like this. If she prefers
me--

951
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:47,733
TRAVIS: Okay.

952
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:52,196
SAM: -- if she prefers me, I'll have that magical
cup of yours.

953
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:54,803
TRAVIS: My magic what?

954
00:56:54,803 --> 00:56:57,270
SAM: Your magical cup that makes liquids.

955
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,454
LIAM: Tary-Town, be careful.

956
00:56:58,454 --> 00:56:59,603
TRAVIS: Oh, the jug.

957
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:00,331
SAM: Yeah.

958
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:01,208
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

959
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,191
TRAVIS: Oh. Whoa. Whoa, shit got real.

960
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:05,375
SAM: And if she prefers you over me--

961
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,739
LAURA: Then you pay your debt to us.

962
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,826
SAM: -- you can have my rod.

963
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:11,310
TRAVIS: How about--

964
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,830
ASHLEY: Can I be in this contest?

965
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,265
LAURA: Yeah!

966
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,165
TALIESIN: Yes.

967
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:19,893
TRAVIS: How about, the jug for that fancy fishing
lure of a helmet you've got.

968
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:24,322
SAM: Why would you want to hide your beautiful
head?

969
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:25,694
TRAVIS: I don't, it's just shiny.

970
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:27,109
SAM: This is--

971
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,938
LAURA: He likes buckets.

972
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:32,834
SAM: My rod can become anything, you understand.

973
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,258
TRAVIS: So can mine, baby.

974
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:45,738
(laughter)

975
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,542
LIAM: You broke yourself!

976
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:55,060
TRAVIS: Dragon killer, debt eraser, takes all
shapes and forms.

977
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:02,692
SAM: The helmet is worth more than you'll ever see
in your life. I don't think that's a fair wager

978
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,065
against your cup.

979
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,693
TRAVIS: The jug for the rod.

980
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,050
SAM: The jug for the rod.

981
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,171
TRAVIS: Yeah.

982
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:09,306
SAM: Jugs and rods.

983
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:10,795
TRAVIS: Yup.

984
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:13,478
MATT: There's the episode title, right there.

985
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:17,221
(laughter)

986
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:18,746
SAM: All right, big boy.

987
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,580
TRAVIS: Yep.

988
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,654
SAM: You swing first.

989
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:24,578
TRAVIS: All right. I'm waiting on my turkey legs.
Just watch. Watch and learn.

990
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:31,827
MATT: In the meantime, you guys come up to the
bartender. A few drinks are brought by. The woman

991
00:58:31,827 --> 00:58:36,519
comes up again and lays out tankards and glass,
whatever's available. It's not a very fine

992
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:41,263
establishment, it's whatever's functional. So some
of them are more clay-based mugs, some are metal--

993
00:58:41,263 --> 00:58:42,809
What's up?

994
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,317
LIAM: Oh, I said it's perfect for us.

995
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:49,148
MATT: Yeah, it works out great for you guys. It's
a motley of various containers. All the drinks are

996
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:55,535
scattered across the table. "All right, your
turkey legs should be ready in the next-- Oh,

997
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,375
"whenever they're ready, I guess."

998
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:03,423
TRAVIS: Oh, you are too kind. And a beauty, to
boot. By the way, do you happen to have-- We've

999
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:09,066
just come back from a very intense battle-- do you
happen to have a needle and thread?

1000
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:12,850
MATT: "Why, whatever for?"

1001
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:19,368
TRAVIS: My darling, it's because I'm so ripped.

1002
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:24,192
MATT: She can't stop the smile, a grin curls on
her face, she goes, (laughs).

1003
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:30,797
LAURA: I feel like us at the table should actually
get to rate the come ons. The females should get

1004
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:31,882
to rate these.

1005
00:59:31,882 --> 00:59:32,831
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

1006
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:33,592
TRAVIS: All right.

1007
00:59:33,592 --> 00:59:34,421
LIAM: Hey!

1008
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:35,709
ASHLEY: I think it's a great idea.

1009
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:39,237
TRAVIS: Beware, this is a no-win zone. Don't get
too close.

1010
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:40,445
TALIESIN: I want in on this as well now.

1011
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:41,332
MARISHA: Wait, you're jumping in on this?

1012
00:59:41,332 --> 00:59:43,116
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm not getting on this, I just want
in on the rating.

1013
00:59:43,116 --> 00:59:44,269
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, on the rating.

1014
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:45,935
MATT: She heads off. She turns around and heads
back to the kitchen.

1015
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:48,093
MARISHA: 50 gold says she hates all of them.

1016
00:59:48,093 --> 00:59:55,585
TALIESIN: I technically can't bet because I do
actually know everyone enough to--

1017
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:57,018
MARISHA: Oh, here, right.

1018
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:59,700
TALIESIN: I have a little more inside knowledge
than one should.

1019
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,928
MARISHA: Is she going to hate all of them?

1020
01:00:01,928 --> 01:00:03,649
TALIESIN: God, I hope so.

1021
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:05,612
(laughter)

1022
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:09,456
MATT: About 15 minutes go by and you guys are
having a conversation, you're catching Pike up

1023
01:00:09,678 --> 01:00:13,666
with what you guys have been doing in the city of
Dis and all the chaos, and in the middle of

1024
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:19,143
telling an incredible story about how you ran into
Tova, right as you get to that point, all of a

1025
01:00:19,143 --> 01:00:23,875
sudden plates (clanging) at the table and you can
see these beautiful turkey legs, fresh out of the

1026
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:29,741
oven. They're still sizzling on the outside. She
says, "Careful now, they're hot. Do you need

1027
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:31,410
"another drink? Anyone else?"

1028
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,413
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, I need another drink, don't you?

1029
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:34,534
SAM: (clears throat) Yes--

1030
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:36,035
LIAM: You don't even need to ask that again, the
whole night.

1031
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,680
SAM: Excuse-- Excuse-- Excuse me--

1032
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,720
MATT: "Good to know."

1033
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,814
SAM: Madam, if I may. Hi. My name is Taryon,
Taryon Darrington.

1034
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:45,204
MATT: "Hi, Taryon."

1035
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:54,822
SAM: It's lovely to meet you. I'm ashamed of
something, and I wanted to tell you about it. My

1036
01:00:54,822 --> 01:01:00,701
friend over there, the big one, pointed you out to
me and said: look at that beautiful girl across

1037
01:01:00,701 --> 01:01:11,895
the room. And I'm ashamed that he had that moment
of seeing you before I did. For knowing that he

1038
01:01:11,895 --> 01:01:21,426
got to experience that beauty for a moment longer
than I. Why, it's almost enough to make me cry.

1039
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:31,986
I've read many books, but your hair could fill a
novel with its beauty. Your eyes are sonnets, your

1040
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:44,260
nose and mouth epic poems. And almost-- almost any
feature of you could be enough to live a life on.

1041
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:54,048
But I'm afraid it's your neck that got me. The
subtle curve, the way it meets your chest just so.

1042
01:01:54,048 --> 01:02:03,879
It's like a wave crashing on a beach, at the same
time ferocious and peaceful. I want to go to that

1043
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:13,462
beach. I want to swim in that tide. I want to dip
my toes in that water and experience it for

1044
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:16,212
myself.

1045
01:02:16,212 --> 01:02:20,097
LIAM: This is legit the twins over here.

1046
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:21,465
MARISHA: Yeah.

1047
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:29,652
MATT: There's definitely a long pause. "Wow."

1048
01:02:29,652 --> 01:02:33,715
(laughter)

1049
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:37,429
MATT: And her hand reaches over and grabs your mug
and slides it away.

1050
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,303
"So I think we're cutting him off."

1051
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:40,993
(laughter)

1052
01:02:40,993 --> 01:02:47,957
TRAVIS: Man, why, I think that's a good idea. Would
you like to take a load off? Join us for a bit,

1053
01:02:47,957 --> 01:02:50,916
I'm sure your legs are super tired.

1054
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:55,910
MATT: "I have about 30 minutes or so before the
rest of this place fills up with folks far less

1055
01:02:55,910 --> 01:03:04,508
"interesting than you, so unfortunately, I've got
to be ready for the rush. Your words are sweet and

1056
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:09,414
"flowery, but I think I may be a little old for
you, sonny." Slides the drink back.

1057
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,688
LAURA: Ooh. She got some experience!

1058
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,693
MARISHA: Roll for restraining order.

1059
01:03:14,693 --> 01:03:16,025
(laughter)

1060
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,581
TRAVIS: Man, I can just picture the spot in my bag
of holding that that rod is going to go into.

1061
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:21,395
SAM: I don't think that's a clear win.

1062
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:22,354
TRAVIS: Yep.

1063
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:23,703
TALIESIN: That's not a clear-- Oh yes.

1064
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:25,474
TRAVIS: You might as well just pack it up right
now.

1065
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:28,750
TALIESIN: No, right now it's, right now it's even
keel, I feel.

1066
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,855
LIAM: I mean we decided to--

1067
01:03:29,855 --> 01:03:30,962
SAM: The night is young.

1068
01:03:30,962 --> 01:03:32,160
LIAM: Who she likes better, but that's open.

1069
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,663
LAURA: What? I mean if you're pursuing like, a
flowery lady--

1070
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:36,186
TALIESIN: Better there's not at all.

1071
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:38,743
LAURA: -- who's never met a real man in her life,
I'd be honest, flowery would work.

1072
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:42,420
SAM: I've read-- That was a chapter from a book I
read. I just recited it back to her. I assumed it

1073
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,751
would work, because it was a romantic novel,
that's all!

1074
01:03:44,751 --> 01:03:48,160
MARISHA: Grog was basically an asshole, and he
still did better than you.

1075
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,499
TRAVIS: Basically?

1076
01:03:49,499 --> 01:03:51,951
SAM: Don't women like that sort of a thing?

1077
01:03:51,951 --> 01:03:53,066
LIAM: What, assholes?

1078
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:55,634
SAM: No! No! Flowery language and stuff!

1079
01:03:55,634 --> 01:03:57,060
LAURA: Too much. It's too much, dear.

1080
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:02,675
TRAVIS: I'll give you a layup, all right? You go
on and just repeat after me. You just say: I want

1081
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,410
to be on you.

1082
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,493
SAM: To that same one, or a different one?

1083
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:10,646
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, you just got to be blunt,
right? You went the real flowery, like, exotic

1084
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,509
way. Now just baseline it. Right.

1085
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:13,382
LAURA: Yeah.

1086
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,589
TRAVIS: You've got to get the dial tone delivery.
I want to be on you.

1087
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:16,599
SAM: All right.

1088
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:19,222
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation she
comes up again and begins filling drinks.

1089
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:26,591
SAM: Oh, there was one more thing I want to say to
you.

1090
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:29,783
MATT: She immediately sets the glass down and
goes--

1091
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,821
SAM: I am sorry, I--

1092
01:04:31,821 --> 01:04:33,351
LAURA: Just don't, just--

1093
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:34,371
SAM: I was taken before--

1094
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,925
LAURA: Just right out.

1095
01:04:35,925 --> 01:04:37,413
SAM: I want to be on you!

1096
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:38,738
TALIESIN: No--

1097
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:40,605
SAM: I want to be on you so bad.

1098
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:41,916
TALIESIN: No.

1099
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:48,173
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1100
01:04:48,173 --> 01:04:51,139
LAURA: This is going to work!

1101
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:53,259
MARISHA: That's better than his first attempt!

1102
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:54,213
LAURA: So much better!

1103
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:55,245
MARISHA: So much better! (laughs)

1104
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:56,273
SAM: 26.

1105
01:04:56,273 --> 01:04:57,432
(laughter)

1106
01:04:57,432 --> 01:05:06,047
MATT: Okay, so she laughs. She goes, (laughs)
"Honey, I give you points for boldness."

1107
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,624
SAM: Points?

1108
01:05:09,624 --> 01:05:12,374
MATT: "Just points."

1109
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:14,118
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1110
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:19,475
MATT: She grabs the bottle, finishes pouring the
drinks and just turns around and leaves.

1111
01:05:19,475 --> 01:05:23,413
SAM: You're some kind of a genius! How did you do
that?

1112
01:05:23,413 --> 01:05:25,404
TALIESIN: I feel the wrong lesson was learned
here.

1113
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,355
SAM: Wow!

1114
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,124
TALIESIN: Reel us all back a bit.

1115
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:33,264
TRAVIS: Forgot the rod? Oh! I forgot we're trying
to get you laid. It's a competition. Right, sorry.

1116
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:34,359
Sorry.

1117
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:36,815
LAURA: You're going to lose your jug.

1118
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:40,135
SAM: Wow, that was amazing! She just went for the
bad boy thing.

1119
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:41,274
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) Well--

1120
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:42,887
SAM: Hah. Women are fascinating.

1121
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:43,899
TALIESIN: Oh no!

1122
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,135
ASHLEY: Oh no.

1123
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:46,270
LAURA: That's fucked up.

1124
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,272
MARISHA: Yeah!

1125
01:05:47,272 --> 01:05:48,342
TRAVIS: Hold on.

1126
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:49,616
ASHLEY: That's not a good lesson to learn.

1127
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:50,578
MARISHA: No, it's not.

1128
01:05:50,578 --> 01:05:54,103
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and seal this up right
now. I get up and leave the table and I go over to

1129
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:55,114
the barmaid.

1130
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:55,952
SAM: Oh boy.

1131
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,792
LAURA: Oh god.

1132
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:59,104
MATT: She is in the process of filling two plates
she's bringing over. Her hair is kind of frazzled

1133
01:05:59,104 --> 01:06:03,185
at this point. More people are coming in now as
the hour is starting to hit where people are soon

1134
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:04,851
to fill the tavern floor for full.

1135
01:06:04,851 --> 01:06:06,725
TRAVIS: Wow. Do you want a hand with that?

1136
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:08,587
MATT: "That'd be great. Thank you, I appreciate
it."

1137
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:09,774
TRAVIS: Yeah, give them to me.

1138
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:12,688
MATT: She hands you a few. Gives you two plates,
picks up two of her own. "This way." And she leads

1139
01:06:12,688 --> 01:06:17,266
you over to one of the far end tables in the other
room and she sets the plates down. "Here you go,

1140
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,951
"honey. Here you go, honey." Takes the plates from
you. "There you go."

1141
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:21,484
TRAVIS: You look so busy.

1142
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:22,550
MATT: "I am."

1143
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:23,488
TRAVIS: Could you do me a favor?

1144
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:24,331
MATT: "Mm-hm."

1145
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:27,275
TRAVIS: If I give you like a lot of money, will
you tell the guy over there that we had a sweet

1146
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,828
shag?

1147
01:06:28,828 --> 01:06:32,977
MARISHA: Jesus.

1148
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:37,123
MATT: If you could hear the pop in her head of
trying to contemplate what you just asked, it

1149
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:39,461
was audible over the music of the tavern.

1150
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:42,786
TRAVIS: You look really busy, and I don't want to
offend--

1151
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:44,925
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

1152
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:45,838
(laughter)

1153
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:47,603
LAURA: Disadvantage.

1154
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:48,854
TRAVIS: That's a two.

1155
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:49,940
LAURA: Oh.

1156
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,259
LIAM: TPK. TPK.

1157
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:52,461
TALIESIN: Nope.

1158
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:53,924
TRAVIS. Three.

1159
01:06:53,924 --> 01:06:56,564
(laughter)

1160
01:06:56,564 --> 01:06:57,961
TRAVIS: Casanova.

1161
01:06:57,961 --> 01:07:00,337
MATT: How did you get a three from a two you
rolled?

1162
01:07:00,337 --> 01:07:02,048
TRAVIS: Two plus one.

1163
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:04,082
MATT: Oh you put, oh, okay, there we go.

1164
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:05,564
(laughter)

1165
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:08,399
MATT: It's like two for-- Yeah. Nice. Okay.

1166
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,279
TALIESIN: Maybe the only thing he knows.

1167
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:13,427
MATT: She goes, "How much money is it?"

1168
01:07:13,427 --> 01:07:16,499
TRAVIS: Shit, numbers.

1169
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:21,586
MATT: "No." And she walks away.

1170
01:07:21,586 --> 01:07:23,438
TRAVIS: Did she say no? She said no?

1171
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:24,585
MARISHA: She definitely--

1172
01:07:24,585 --> 01:07:30,114
TRAVIS: All right, I walk back to the group. It's
me and her later tonight.

1173
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,729
MARISHA: Wow.

1174
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:32,814
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1175
01:07:32,814 --> 01:07:34,266
MATT: Make a deception check.

1176
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,478
(laughter)

1177
01:07:36,478 --> 01:07:38,837
MARISHA: Can I roll against that?

1178
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:40,232
TRAVIS: 20.

1179
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:42,827
MATT: Anyone who wants to make an insight check,
go for it.

1180
01:07:42,827 --> 01:07:44,187
LIAM: 28.

1181
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:45,726
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1182
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:49,454
LAURA: Yeah, definitely higher than 20.

1183
01:07:49,454 --> 01:07:51,081
SAM: I rolled low.

1184
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,428
TRAVIS: I can't roll any higher than that.

1185
01:07:52,428 --> 01:07:56,582
MATT: All of you pull back and groan, except for
Taryon, who looks broken and crushed,

1186
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:58,314
momentarily.

1187
01:07:58,314 --> 01:08:03,341
MARISHA: Tary, Grog is teaching you the opposite
of what to do.

1188
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:08,352
SAM: What do you mean? Girls don't like the bad
boy?

1189
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:13,902
TALIESIN: If you want to discover what girls
actually like, ask girls.

1190
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:15,617
LAURA: Maybe talk to them.

1191
01:08:15,617 --> 01:08:17,353
TALIESIN: We've got three--

1192
01:08:17,353 --> 01:08:19,420
LAURA: Don't talk at them. Talk to them.

1193
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,667
MARISHA: Maybe individually.

1194
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,070
TALIESIN: Wells of knowledge.

1195
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,205
SAM: Keyleth.

1196
01:08:23,205 --> 01:08:26,059
MARISHA: Oh no. Yeah?

1197
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:31,994
SAM: Your hair is like angels coming down from the
sky--

1198
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:33,322
TALIESIN: Nope, already lost it. Nope.

1199
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,414
LAURA: Don't talk at them.

1200
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,553
TALIESIN: Don't talk to the hair.

1201
01:08:36,553 --> 01:08:42,954
MARISHA: Why don't you, for starters, ask them a
question about themselves?

1202
01:08:42,954 --> 01:08:44,148
SAM: All right.

1203
01:08:44,148 --> 01:08:46,918
MARISHA: Instead of talking about yourself.

1204
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:50,179
LIAM: You don't necessarily want to tell them
things. You want to talk to them

1205
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:51,971
and learn about them.

1206
01:08:51,971 --> 01:08:54,097
SAM: How much money do you have?

1207
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,323
ASHLEY: Oops.

1208
01:08:55,323 --> 01:08:59,714
LAURA: (laughs) No, that's a question for me,
darling.

1209
01:08:59,714 --> 01:09:07,280
MARISHA: Maybe less a monetary stat question.
Maybe find a question about her personality or

1210
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,975
about her past or something that interests her.

1211
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:11,219
SAM: All right.

1212
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:13,171
MARISHA: Yeah. Try again.

1213
01:09:13,171 --> 01:09:15,389
SAM: All right. Hi, I'm Taryon Darrington.

1214
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:17,799
MARISHA: Hi, Tary. Pleasure to meet you.

1215
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:27,132
SAM: Nice to meet you. So, what do you like to do
at night? Do you have a servant who brushes your

1216
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:35,163
hair, or do you just brush your own? No. Have you
killed-- no.

1217
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:39,052
TALIESIN: At some pubs, that could have gone
well.

1218
01:09:39,052 --> 01:09:44,712
MARISHA: You're getting close. Just try, for once,
to think about someone other than yourself.

1219
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:49,059
MATT: At which point, she goes back to the table to
bring you your third round. As she does, she goes

1220
01:09:49,126 --> 01:09:54,218
and returns all the mugs to the table, finishing
with yours. She slides it forward to you and gives

1221
01:09:54,218 --> 01:09:55,686
you a wink.

1222
01:09:55,686 --> 01:09:57,022
SAM: A wink?

1223
01:09:57,022 --> 01:09:58,908
TRAVIS: Later tonight, player!

1224
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,016
SAM: I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot
earlier.

1225
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:05,106
MATT: (laughs) "It's okay."

1226
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:10,149
SAM: I was taken by your obvious beauty, but
there's so much more to you than that, I'm sure.

1227
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:15,199
MARISHA: (whispers) Come on.

1228
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,631
SAM: If I could--

1229
01:10:16,631 --> 01:10:23,591
MARISHA: One thing about herself!

1230
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:35,910
SAM: Tell me about yourself. How do you feel
about-- What do you do during the day when the

1231
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:38,647
pub's not open?

1232
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:45,140
MATT: She's taken aback for a moment. Looks at
everyone else at the table with a

1233
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,441
"who are you people?" look.

1234
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,325
TALIESIN: Yeah, Matt. What does she do during the
day when the pub's not open?

1235
01:10:51,325 --> 01:10:53,824
(laughter)

1236
01:10:53,824 --> 01:10:57,285
SAM: I'm a writer and a reader. What are your
hobbies?

1237
01:10:57,285 --> 01:11:04,465
MATT: "My hobbies involve raising two children
after Darren left about ten years back, and

1238
01:11:04,465 --> 01:11:10,222
"working hard to make some money and hopefully one
day get out of this shithole tavern and maybe

1239
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:16,579
"start a business doing some sort of, I don't know,
textile work. Which, by the way, I brought your

1240
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:23,369
"thread and needle." And she throws down what looks
like a half-done, shoddy knitting job.

1241
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:29,358
SAM: Those children are lucky to have a mother as
hard-working as you.

1242
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:32,345
MATT: "They're lucky to have a mother in this day
and age."

1243
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:34,197
LAURA: That's so true.

1244
01:11:34,197 --> 01:11:37,610
MATT: She grabs one of your drinks.

1245
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:49,924
SAM: Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a family
because it would be a shame for someone like you

1246
01:11:49,924 --> 01:11:51,973
to be alone.

1247
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:56,160
MATT: "Honey, are you having a hard time asking
questions? I get the sense that you're new to this

1248
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,029
"whole thing."

1249
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:03,509
SAM: Yeah. Yes, I am. I don't know what I'm doing,
and I'm floundering a bit.

1250
01:12:03,509 --> 01:12:12,665
MATT: "It was not hard to read from you. Let me
tell you, the first thing that helps a lot? Ask

1251
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:14,943
"what their name is."

1252
01:12:14,943 --> 01:12:17,554
SAM: What's your name?

1253
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:20,296
MATT: "Shauna. Shauna Rual. What's your name?"

1254
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:21,986
SAM AND MATT: Taryon Darringon.

1255
01:12:21,986 --> 01:12:25,003
MATT: "First thing you told me. Didn't even ask
first."

1256
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:26,567
LIAM: What is that mother's name?

1257
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:30,687
(laughter)

1258
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:31,612
SAM: Yes!

1259
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:33,341
TALIESIN: Bringing it all back.

1260
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:37,307
MATT: "There you go. Now it's nice to meet you."

1261
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:46,479
SAM: It's lovely to meet you. I could end the
evening right now having learned a lot from you

1262
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:47,607
already.

1263
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:51,236
MATT: "Great. I'll come back with the next round."
She leaves the table.

1264
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:52,456
SAM: Shauna!

1265
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:53,511
MARISHA: She's awesome.

1266
01:12:53,511 --> 01:12:55,711
SAM: She is awesome. I like her a lot.

1267
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:58,576
LAURA: I think the lesson went well tonight.

1268
01:12:58,576 --> 01:13:00,874
TALIESIN: I'm feeling very positive about the
whole deal.

1269
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:05,715
SAM: I feel inv-- I'm speechless.

1270
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,234
MARISHA: The alcohol has worked.

1271
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:12,973
SAM: Well, a draw, then?

1272
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:17,048
TALIESIN: I feel that this is a reasonable draw.

1273
01:13:17,048 --> 01:13:19,544
TRAVIS: Why? I'm hooking up.

1274
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:26,373
SAM: All right. We'll continue, then, until this
is done.

1275
01:13:26,373 --> 01:13:32,112
TRAVIS: Fine, jeez. Draw. Just because.

1276
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:37,460
SAM: I defeated a goliath.

1277
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:43,478
(laughter)

1278
01:13:43,478 --> 01:13:46,108
LAURA: How many more things on that list, Tary?

1279
01:13:46,108 --> 01:13:50,874
MATT: As you simmer, Grog, you pull up your tankard
and take a sip, and it is the most watered-down

1280
01:13:50,938 --> 01:13:53,421
ale you've ever had in your life.

1281
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:55,789
TRAVIS: I don't show anything and drink it all.

1282
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:58,649
(laughter)

1283
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:06,087
LIAM: I rest my head on Keyleth's shoulder and
say, I almost wish we were back in the City of Dis

1284
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,393
right now.

1285
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:08,381
LAURA: Woof.

1286
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:09,477
LIAM: Woof.

1287
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:10,439
MARISHA: Why?

1288
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:11,326
LAURA: What for?

1289
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,852
TALIESIN: We've had enough of that.

1290
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:16,534
ASHLEY: How come? Did you like it there?

1291
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:23,236
LIAM: No, it was terrible. Everything looked the
same. It was dark, it was gray, it was full of

1292
01:14:23,236 --> 01:14:25,060
fucking nightmares.

1293
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:33,267
LAURA: There were really terrible people there.
People were being tortured. We saw it happen. Oh!

1294
01:14:33,267 --> 01:14:36,449
We saw a torture chamber. You would have loved it!
I thought of you.

1295
01:14:36,449 --> 01:14:38,581
ASHLEY: Did you get anything out of it?

1296
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:41,574
LAURA: No, I almost did, and I felt really weird
about it.

1297
01:14:41,574 --> 01:14:44,504
LIAM: I take it back, we did meet one really cool
person.

1298
01:14:44,504 --> 01:14:45,729
TALIESIN: We met a bear.

1299
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:46,972
LAURA: Yeah.

1300
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,130
ASHLEY: You met a bear?

1301
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,239
LAURA: A werebear.

1302
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:50,323
LIAM: Werebear.

1303
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:51,759
TALIESIN: A werebear there.

1304
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:53,651
ASHLEY: Did they make friends with Trinket?

1305
01:14:53,651 --> 01:15:01,326
LAURA: Trinket was-- I think he had a bit of a
crush. Trinket, did you have a crush on Tova?

1306
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:04,757
MATT: You look back and Trinket is sitting by the
doorway, which has been great, because every time

1307
01:15:04,757 --> 01:15:11,761
a patron walks in, they go, "Hey. Huh?" And slowly
has to step a wide circle around the bear that's just

1308
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:14,829
sitting right by the entrance.

1309
01:15:14,895 --> 01:15:17,469
TRAVIS: An armored bear.

1310
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:25,343
MARISHA: What is it that you miss about the City
of Dis?

1311
01:15:25,343 --> 01:15:27,601
LIAM: Oh, I was being facetious.

1312
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:29,242
MARISHA AND LAURA: Oh.

1313
01:15:29,242 --> 01:15:33,047
LIAM: I just meant that performance was a little
tense, Tary. But a better towards the end.

1314
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:34,635
TALIESIN: You're improving.

1315
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:37,043
LAURA: Yeah, look at you, asking questions.

1316
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:39,159
TALIESIN: Learning names.

1317
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,232
LIAM: Surviving hell, talking to women.

1318
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:46,826
SAM: Talking-- oh, yes. I haven't picked up a
woman in a bar before.

1319
01:15:46,826 --> 01:15:48,895
MARISHA: Was that on your list?

1320
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:50,822
SAM: No.

1321
01:15:50,822 --> 01:15:51,768
MARISHA: Oh.

1322
01:15:51,768 --> 01:15:53,490
TRAVIS: Well, you have--

1323
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,010
ASHLEY: You've picked up a woman before, but just
not in a bar?

1324
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,216
SAM: No.

1325
01:15:59,216 --> 01:16:09,400
MATT: You guys have noticed at this point, by the
way, that Shauna has set down food at a nearby

1326
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:12,758
table and is listening in to this conversation as
you progress.

1327
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:21,577
SAM: I've never hit on a woman like that before.
Or any, for that matter. As I told you, I led a

1328
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:33,229
sheltered life, and I've really only had one
romantic experience.

1329
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:34,987
LAURA: Was it with Doty?

1330
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:39,154
SAM: Oh god. Doty was a machine made of metal.

1331
01:16:39,154 --> 01:16:40,734
TALIESIN: We're not judging.

1332
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,911
LAURA: No, it's not judging.

1333
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:45,857
MARISHA: It would have been my first question,
too. I'm not going to lie.

1334
01:16:45,857 --> 01:16:47,051
SAM: Really?

1335
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:48,049
MARISHA: Sorry.

1336
01:16:48,049 --> 01:16:49,678
LAURA: It was a terrible joke.

1337
01:16:49,678 --> 01:16:51,909
LIAM: We've never met anybody like Doty before.

1338
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:55,642
TALIESIN: I was a bit awkward with girls before I
started out.

1339
01:16:55,642 --> 01:16:56,736
SAM: Really?

1340
01:16:56,736 --> 01:16:57,570
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

1341
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:58,950
SAM: You? Debonair?

1342
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,287
TALIESIN: I had a lot of sisters.

1343
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,828
SAM: Royal?

1344
01:17:01,828 --> 01:17:05,684
TALIESIN: Well, we end up sheltered, don't we?

1345
01:17:05,684 --> 01:17:09,179
LAURA: He's got really good technique. He always
brings a bottle of liquor with him.

1346
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:17,442
TALIESIN: I learn very quickly. She's an excellent
teacher. Never mind. But no, adventuring and going

1347
01:17:17,442 --> 01:17:24,264
out into the world, you learn a lot. You meet
people. You get out. It's good for you. Look at

1348
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:25,511
all these people.

1349
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:30,411
MARISHA: I was very sheltered-- (gasps) were all
three of us sheltered on this side?

1350
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:32,797
TALIESIN: We are sheltered children on this side.

1351
01:17:32,797 --> 01:17:41,357
MARISHA: Yay, sheltered kids! Hey. Awkward.

1352
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:46,463
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Taryon, you feel a hand hit your shoulder and turn

1353
01:17:46,463 --> 01:17:51,657
you back a little bit. It's Shauna. She leans
forward and says, "Listen, honey. If you're

1354
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:55,767
"looking to go ahead and find yourself an evening,
wait here about 30 minutes. I'll introduce you to

1355
01:17:55,767 --> 01:17:59,591
"someone." And she releases your shoulder and goes
back to work.

1356
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:05,515
TALIESIN: This is also why you always make friends
with women. They have friends. There's just

1357
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,832
networks of them. It's brilliant.

1358
01:18:07,832 --> 01:18:11,083
LIAM: That is some of the best advice I've ever
heard leave your mouth.

1359
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:13,086
TALIESIN: Thank you!

1360
01:18:13,086 --> 01:18:20,299
TRAVIS: This is so great. The one romance you had
before, did it go well?

1361
01:18:20,299 --> 01:18:22,690
SAM: No, it did not.

1362
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:24,203
TRAVIS: It didn't?

1363
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:26,761
TALIESIN: Oh my god. No. Wait. No!

1364
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:28,825
ASHLEY: Wait, what did you say? What did I miss?

1365
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:31,957
TALIESIN: Did your father find out about--

1366
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,286
SAM: My father did find out.

1367
01:18:33,286 --> 01:18:34,293
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1368
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:35,519
ASHLEY: What?

1369
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,581
MARISHA: What happened to her?

1370
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,508
TALIESIN: More liquor.

1371
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:39,111
LAURA: Wait, what?

1372
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:43,028
TALIESIN: No, we're sitting down for parental
issues.

1373
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:46,684
MARISHA: We all scooch up chairs. What happened?

1374
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:52,664
LIAM: This is part of the initiation process,
Tary. We all went through this. Tell us

1375
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:54,468
everything.

1376
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:56,046
SAM: You guys are friends, right?

1377
01:18:56,046 --> 01:18:56,975
LIAM AND TALIESIN: Yes.

1378
01:18:56,975 --> 01:18:58,351
TRAVIS: No. Yes.

1379
01:18:58,351 --> 01:19:09,915
SAM: My father, as I told you, has threatened to
give the entire legacy of his estate to my sister

1380
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:16,990
because he doesn't feel that I am ready to take
the reins. I'm not strong enough, and I'm not

1381
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:28,751
vicious enough. But it's more than that. He caught
me with a teacher, a tutor, once.

1382
01:19:28,751 --> 01:19:31,763
ASHLEY: Whoa.

1383
01:19:31,763 --> 01:19:34,424
SAM: He gave me all the best tutors.

1384
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:35,811
MARISHA: Apparently.

1385
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:38,484
(laughter)

1386
01:19:38,484 --> 01:19:45,969
SAM: And I learned a lot, but there was one who
taught me some extra things.

1387
01:19:45,969 --> 01:19:50,491
LIAM: What was her name?

1388
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:56,643
SAM: His name. It's embarrassing.

1389
01:19:56,643 --> 01:19:59,809
TALIESIN: Oh no, I think I know. Please, go on.

1390
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:01,254
SAM: Lawrence.

1391
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,914
TALIESIN: (sighs) Good name.

1392
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:07,054
SAM: Larry. Larry and Tary.

1393
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:09,940
LIAM: That's adorable.

1394
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,009
TALIESIN: That's so adorable! I'm so sorry.

1395
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:20,007
SAM: He and I hit it off. We would talk about
literature and philosophy and all sorts of things

1396
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:28,845
until the wee hours, and my father walked in on us
once, and I don't know what happened to him, but

1397
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:32,043
I'm afraid he's dead.

1398
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:33,222
MARISHA: Oh, Tary.

1399
01:20:33,222 --> 01:20:34,328
LIAM AND LAURA: What?

1400
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:38,944
SAM: Or banished, or something bad. I don't know.
I never saw him again.

1401
01:20:38,944 --> 01:20:40,187
MARISHA: That's awful.

1402
01:20:40,187 --> 01:20:42,614
LAURA: How much older was he than you?

1403
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:48,061
SAM: Ten years older than me.

1404
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:51,001
ASHLEY and MARISHA: How old were you?

1405
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:54,576
SAM: This was a few years ago, so maybe 20.

1406
01:20:54,576 --> 01:20:56,742
ALL: Oh, all right.

1407
01:20:56,742 --> 01:21:00,699
LIAM: And you confronted your father? Did you try
to find out what happened to Lawrence?

1408
01:21:00,699 --> 01:21:04,011
SAM: I wasn't a little boy! No.

1409
01:21:04,011 --> 01:21:06,264
MARISHA: You didn't lead with that.

1410
01:21:06,264 --> 01:21:07,876
SAM: No.

1411
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:15,049
MARISHA: Tary, why didn't you tell us that? Maybe
we've been taking the wrong approach this whole

1412
01:21:15,049 --> 01:21:16,430
time.

1413
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:22,606
SAM: Well, I'm a dashing adventurer, and I'm
supposed to attract all of the lasses of the

1414
01:21:22,606 --> 01:21:23,759
kingdom, right?

1415
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:26,075
ALL: Well.

1416
01:21:26,075 --> 01:21:31,151
SAM: They throw themselves at me because of my
derring-do and bravery and my hair.

1417
01:21:31,151 --> 01:21:33,728
MARISHA: Have you experienced that once?

1418
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:40,158
SAM: No, but I feel that-- in all the books I've
read, they never tell of the adventurers who go to

1419
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:41,988
bed with older men.

1420
01:21:41,988 --> 01:21:47,168
TALIESIN: Do you know why? Because those
adventurers are busy actually having a good time.

1421
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:52,913
LIAM: Has anything you've gone through with us
been like the books you've read?

1422
01:21:52,913 --> 01:22:01,850
SAM: No. It's much grosser in real life. And more
terrifying, and so badly planned.

1423
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,019
(laughter)

1424
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:11,597
SAM: Every book you read is tactical geniuses and
strategy for days, but we just go in with nothing.

1425
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:14,588
Nothing at all. No backup plan, no exit strategy.

1426
01:22:14,588 --> 01:22:17,545
MARISHA: And why do you think that would be any
different than our dating strategy?

1427
01:22:17,545 --> 01:22:19,228
LAURA: Terrible.

1428
01:22:19,228 --> 01:22:23,766
LIAM: Everything you've read about romance, well,
that's horseshit.

1429
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:27,009
LAURA: We should find Lawrence! We should see if
we can find him!

1430
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:29,200
SAM: He's probably dead.

1431
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,175
LAURA: We should scry on him!

1432
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:34,772
MARISHA: Do you have a reminder of him? Any
items?

1433
01:22:34,772 --> 01:22:36,015
SAM: No.

1434
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:38,725
LAURA: Nothing? Can you describe him? Would it
work?

1435
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:42,852
SAM: He was tall. He was fair-skinned. He was
strong.

1436
01:22:42,852 --> 01:22:51,185
LIAM: Since we're friends now, and you're learning
about us, what does your father do that you

1437
01:22:51,185 --> 01:22:54,267
suspect he killed this poor man?

1438
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:56,743
SAM: Real estate.

1439
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:59,388
LAURA: Real estate.

1440
01:22:59,388 --> 01:23:01,830
LIAM: He's a land baron?

1441
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:04,732
TALIESIN: Never trust a man who sells property.

1442
01:23:04,732 --> 01:23:14,532
SAM: Real estate. He buys and sells properties.
Mostly buys and holds. Leases them back to the

1443
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:24,254
kingdom who sold it to him for a huge markup, and
charges taxes on people that use the properties,

1444
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:31,568
exorbitant taxes. And he shakes down people who
use his properties. It's all very shady and murky,

1445
01:23:31,568 --> 01:23:34,848
but it all involves real estate.

1446
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,710
LAURA: You don't want to be that.

1447
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,903
LIAM: Do you like your father?

1448
01:23:38,903 --> 01:23:44,788
SAM: He's a great man. He's made a lot of money,
and he's respected and feared by many.

1449
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:48,011
TALIESIN: We just killed a dragon that made a lot
of money.

1450
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:50,269
LIAM: Do you like your father?

1451
01:23:50,269 --> 01:23:55,242
SAM: I hate him, more than anything.

1452
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:59,225
MARISHA: Then why do you feel like you need to
impress him?

1453
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:04,509
SAM: Because-- I don't know. He's my dad.

1454
01:24:04,509 --> 01:24:06,086
LAURA: I got you, boo.

1455
01:24:06,086 --> 01:24:07,720
MARISHA: Daddy issues.

1456
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,713
TALIESIN: I kind of want to rough him up.

1457
01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:10,843
SAM: Rough me up?

1458
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:12,204
TALIESIN: No, not you. You're fine.

1459
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:15,053
LIAM: We've already put you through the ringer,
darling. You're fine.

1460
01:24:15,053 --> 01:24:21,194
LAURA: Well, shit. Tary, you don't have to go back
to him if you don't want to.

1461
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:23,416
You can stay with us.

1462
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:27,028
TALIESIN: You can do whatever you like.

1463
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,898
SAM: And be poor.

1464
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:34,268
TALIESIN: Or slightly wealthy. There's worse
things than poverty.

1465
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:40,476
MARISHA: There's more to respect and honor than
just money. A lot more. In fact, generally money

1466
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:42,124
tends to make you--

1467
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:43,146
LIAM: Miserable.

1468
01:24:43,146 --> 01:24:44,385
MARISHA: Shittier.

1469
01:24:44,385 --> 01:24:46,333
LAURA: I don't fully agree with that.

1470
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:50,489
TALIESIN: I don't fully agree with that, either.
Although I spent quite a bit of time before I met

1471
01:24:50,489 --> 01:24:59,874
this group of people dirt poor. Beggar poor. It
wasn't the best time of my life, but-- I don't

1472
01:24:59,874 --> 01:25:02,218
remember my point. It was actually pretty awful.

1473
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:06,418
LIAM: I think if we're going to bring up how you
shat on money when we first met you and talked

1474
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:09,899
about how it was pointless and didn't bring you
happiness.

1475
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:12,370
TALIESIN: It's true. I did say it was pointless.

1476
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,476
LAURA: You did give it away.

1477
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:20,917
TALIESIN: And because it comes with an enormous
amount of responsibility and complications. And

1478
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:26,916
while it's nice to have, because I'm using it to
do some good in the world now, and because without

1479
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:32,485
it, she becomes slightly more questionably evil
than she currently is, bless.

1480
01:25:32,485 --> 01:25:33,972
LIAM: She's so evil.

1481
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:40,343
TALIESIN: It's not the secret to happiness. It
doesn't actually help if you're not already happy.

1482
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:46,494
It can augment existing happiness, it just doesn't
create it from scratch.

1483
01:25:46,494 --> 01:25:50,513
MARISHA: I feel like we're suddenly talking about
your problems.

1484
01:25:50,513 --> 01:25:53,157
TALIESIN: Or baking bread. I'm not sure.

1485
01:25:53,157 --> 01:25:55,267
MARISHA: Still your problems, yeah.

1486
01:25:55,267 --> 01:25:57,248
TALIESIN: I'm going to drink more.

1487
01:25:57,248 --> 01:25:59,975
TRAVIS: Tary, did you want to get laid tonight?

1488
01:25:59,975 --> 01:26:01,660
SAM: No, thank you.

1489
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,140
TRAVIS: No?

1490
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,371
LAURA: I think Grog's offering.

1491
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:06,161
LIAM: Yeah, I do, too.

1492
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,790
TRAVIS: I mean, I'll pay for it.

1493
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:13,140
SAM: Like a house of ill repute?

1494
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,148
TRAVIS: Yeah. Have you ever been to the lady
favors?

1495
01:26:16,148 --> 01:26:18,048
TALIESIN: It actually has a very good reputation,
to be fair.

1496
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:19,166
LAURA: Oh.

1497
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,134
SAM: A brothel?

1498
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:20,865
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1499
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:21,661
SAM: Me?

1500
01:26:21,661 --> 01:26:22,469
TRAVIS: Yep.

1501
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,450
SAM: Taryon Darrington in a house of flesh?

1502
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:29,250
TRAVIS: Yeah, you go in, throw some spaghetti on
the wall, see what sticks, and have a great time.

1503
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,889
TALIESIN: There's not actual spaghetti.

1504
01:26:30,889 --> 01:26:32,369
TRAVIS: There might be.

1505
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:34,905
(laughter)

1506
01:26:34,905 --> 01:26:37,108
TRAVIS: What do you think?

1507
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,605
LIAM: Mayonnaise, at the very least.

1508
01:26:38,605 --> 01:26:41,546
(groaning, laughter)

1509
01:26:41,546 --> 01:26:44,361
TALIESIN: Oh, that's funny twice, too.

1510
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:49,685
(laughter)

1511
01:26:49,685 --> 01:26:51,149
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Yay.

1512
01:26:51,149 --> 01:26:57,531
TRAVIS: What do you think, huh? I know if we had
said, "you're going to fight a dragon and a

1513
01:26:57,531 --> 01:27:03,881
"kraken," you'd be like, "no, not me!" But this is
a chance for you to go to the big time.

1514
01:27:03,881 --> 01:27:10,839
TALIESIN: Maybe take some pressure off and
practice talking normally to people who are going

1515
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:13,618
to be very gentle with you about the whole
process.

1516
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:14,793
SAM: Talking?

1517
01:27:14,793 --> 01:27:18,122
ASHLEY: You don't even have to do anything. You
can just have an hour of their time.

1518
01:27:18,122 --> 01:27:20,335
SAM: Pike, are you encouraging me to go to a
brothel right now?

1519
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:32,227
ASHLEY: Listen, I do think that going to, as you
put it, a house of flesh, is a part of being an

1520
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:40,977
adventurer. It's a rite of passage.

1521
01:27:40,977 --> 01:27:44,163
LAURA: Do you go to brothels, Pike?

1522
01:27:44,163 --> 01:27:47,491
ASHLEY: Well, where do you think I go when you
guys leave all the time?

1523
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:49,914
(laughter)

1524
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:53,332
TRAVIS: Pike is crushing it!

1525
01:27:53,332 --> 01:27:56,943
TALIESIN: I missed you so much.

1526
01:27:56,943 --> 01:28:03,563
MARISHA: Then why did we get mimosas and go
shopping when we had our girls' day?

1527
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:05,367
ASHLEY: Say again?

1528
01:28:05,367 --> 01:28:11,481
MARISHA: Why did we get mimosas and just go
shopping on our girls' day? I feel like we got

1529
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:12,535
robbed.

1530
01:28:12,535 --> 01:28:14,955
ASHLEY: Well, those are so fun, too.

1531
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:17,385
TRAVIS: Don't go shopping next time. I never do.

1532
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:22,215
MATT: Vax and Vex, as you guys are having this
conversation, you notice that Shauna's in the

1533
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:27,945
progress of conversing with a figure at the bar
who sat down not too long ago. You can only see

1534
01:28:27,945 --> 01:28:32,040
from the back, but you see a set of armor that is
Pale Guard-specific. They have a brief

1535
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,401
conversation, and the figure turns around and
begins to approach the table after glancing over

1536
01:28:36,401 --> 01:28:43,092
the shoulder a few times towards where you guys
are sitting. As you guys are talking, from behind

1537
01:28:43,092 --> 01:28:54,214
Taryon, a large figure looms up from behind and
smiles, as you guys recognize, with the brunette

1538
01:28:54,214 --> 01:29:00,703
hair pulled back into a tight bun behind, the
healing scar on the face, you see Tricia, one of

1539
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,031
the Pale Guard.

1540
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:04,337
TRAVIS: Yeah! She beat me at arm wrestling.

1541
01:29:04,337 --> 01:29:05,920
LAURA: Trish the Dish!

1542
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,768
MARISHA: Totally Trish the Dish.

1543
01:29:07,768 --> 01:29:12,320
MATT: As she walks up and leans and touches the
edge of your shoulder, pats you, and goes, "Hey,

1544
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:20,175
"so I've had a long day. I've been told you've had
a long day."

1545
01:29:20,175 --> 01:29:27,238
SAM: Yes, I have. I lost--

1546
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,750
MATT: "Can I buy you a drink?"

1547
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,958
MARISHA: Just say yes.

1548
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:33,422
SAM: Yes, please.

1549
01:29:33,422 --> 01:29:34,974
MATT: "What'll you have?"

1550
01:29:34,974 --> 01:29:37,426
SAM: Your finest, oldest wine, I guess?

1551
01:29:37,426 --> 01:29:42,981
MATT: "Gotcha. Scotch. All right." She backs away,
walks back up to the bar.

1552
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:45,768
TALIESIN: That was hot. Damn.

1553
01:29:45,768 --> 01:29:50,120
LAURA: You see how she did that?

1554
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,145
MARISHA: Yeah, learn from Trish.

1555
01:29:53,145 --> 01:29:55,268
SAM: I'm learning.

1556
01:29:55,268 --> 01:29:57,006
TALIESIN: I feel like I just learned something.

1557
01:29:57,006 --> 01:29:59,913
LIAM: Don't quote fairytales anymore.

1558
01:29:59,913 --> 01:30:08,285
LAURA: I mean, unless you want you. If that's the
way you think you're going to pick up a girl or a

1559
01:30:08,285 --> 01:30:14,268
guy, maybe that's the way and you'll just find
somebody who likes that. You might get a lot of

1560
01:30:14,268 --> 01:30:19,810
rejection until that point, but eventually you'll
find the person that it registers with.

1561
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,811
MATT: Two glasses slam down on the table in
front--

1562
01:30:22,811 --> 01:30:24,429
TALIESIN: Or you'll just have a great time.

1563
01:30:24,429 --> 01:30:33,222
MATT: Pours a really thick amber-like liquid into
each of these. Slams the drink down. Pulls her bun

1564
01:30:33,222 --> 01:30:37,306
out, her hair curled up and crimped from being put
up falls around the shoulder.

1565
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:42,152
SAM: (coughs)

1566
01:30:42,152 --> 01:30:44,855
TRAVIS: Do not puke. Do not puke.

1567
01:30:44,855 --> 01:30:46,037
SAM: Nope, nope.

1568
01:30:46,037 --> 01:30:47,171
LAURA: You're doing great.

1569
01:30:47,171 --> 01:30:48,375
SAM: What's your name?

1570
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:54,006
MATT: "Shauna, we're taking the bottle. They call
me Trish. What's your name?"

1571
01:30:54,006 --> 01:30:57,180
SAM: TD.

1572
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,954
(laughter)

1573
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:03,812
MATT: "Well, TD, let's go and have a walk in the
moonlight." She takes you by the arm, lifts you

1574
01:31:03,812 --> 01:31:06,280
out of your chair onto your feet.

1575
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,594
SAM: Oh, she lifted me up.

1576
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:13,038
MATT: Lifted out of your chair, onto your feet.
And goes, "Good to see you guys.

1577
01:31:13,038 --> 01:31:15,603
"Still working out?"

1578
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,663
TRAVIS: Yeah. But I probably couldn't take you.

1579
01:31:18,663 --> 01:31:24,871
MATT: "I knew you couldn't. See you next Winter's
Crest, right? All right. Have a good night. You're

1580
01:31:24,871 --> 01:31:27,518
"coming with me." She smacks you on the ass as she
pushes you out of the room.

1581
01:31:27,518 --> 01:31:28,775
SAM: Tell my story!

1582
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,674
(laughter)

1583
01:31:31,674 --> 01:31:37,114
MATT: You guys watch as Trish, who's a good seven
or eight inches taller than Taryon, is guiding him

1584
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:41,587
with one hand in the center of his back just
pushing him out of the tavern. You see them both

1585
01:31:41,587 --> 01:31:44,082
disappear into the now dark--

1586
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,215
TRAVIS: Dude, I had a thing for Trish once upon a
time.

1587
01:31:47,215 --> 01:31:49,071
LAURA: I know you did. Are you okay?

1588
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:50,521
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1589
01:31:50,521 --> 01:31:51,679
LAURA: Do you still?

1590
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,778
TRAVIS: Well, I mean--

1591
01:31:52,778 --> 01:31:54,005
LAURA: Was it a little painful?

1592
01:31:54,005 --> 01:31:55,546
ASHLEY: You could go rescue him.

1593
01:31:55,546 --> 01:31:57,551
LAURA: You could. He's not going to be into it.

1594
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:01,170
TRAVIS: No, I am not CB-ing that action, all
right?

1595
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:02,869
SAM: CB-ing?

1596
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:04,306
TRAVIS: Yeah, canary blocking.

1597
01:32:04,306 --> 01:32:08,732
LAURA: Could we get an insight if Taryon seemed
excited or just terribly scared?

1598
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:11,620
MATT: Sure.

1599
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,373
TALIESIN: 21.

1600
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:18,353
LAURA: That's better than what I rolled.

1601
01:32:18,353 --> 01:32:19,947
MATT: Taryon?

1602
01:32:19,947 --> 01:32:21,300
SAM: Very scared.

1603
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,154
LAURA: Not happy? Not happy at all or like cool?

1604
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:25,579
SAM: Interested but scared.

1605
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:31,592
TALIESIN: I think he needs this. I think it'll be
all right.

1606
01:32:31,592 --> 01:32:32,850
TRAVIS: I agree with Percy.

1607
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:34,877
LIAM: I hope he likes it.

1608
01:32:34,877 --> 01:32:37,973
LAURA: This is so uncomfortable to talk about.

1609
01:32:37,973 --> 01:32:40,863
MARISHA: I don't want to think about that.

1610
01:32:40,863 --> 01:32:44,835
TALIESIN: Do you have your orb?

1611
01:32:44,835 --> 01:32:51,035
MARISHA: Uhh. Why you asking, Percy?

1612
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:52,288
TALIESIN: I'm just saying.

1613
01:32:52,288 --> 01:32:54,920
MARISHA: Why you asking, Percy?

1614
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:01,149
TALIESIN: I'm just going to double-check. It'll be
fine. Just going to double-check, real quick. They

1615
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:04,320
haven't started anything yet. I'm just going to
take a peek.

1616
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,228
MARISHA: I'm going to give that a big fat no.

1617
01:33:06,228 --> 01:33:07,966
TALIESIN: What if I owe you a favor?

1618
01:33:07,966 --> 01:33:11,377
MARISHA: The Voice of the Tempest is overruling
you on this one.

1619
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:17,634
TALIESIN: I'm appealing beyond the Voice of the
Tempest, to the heart of the storm. I'm asking the

1620
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:22,461
heart of the storm, pleading to the heart of the
storm far beyond the Voice of the Tempest. There's

1621
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:23,989
nothing to be heard here.

1622
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:28,252
MARISHA: La-la-la, the Voice is very loud right
now. Sorry, the Voice cannot hear you. The Voice

1623
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:30,449
is going to have to take a message.

1624
01:33:30,449 --> 01:33:32,067
LAURA: You could always try following them.

1625
01:33:32,067 --> 01:33:35,170
TRAVIS: Yeah, why don't you go walk down the
hallway?

1626
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:37,762
TALIESIN: I didn't want to disturb them.

1627
01:33:37,762 --> 01:33:39,278
TRAVIS: It's outside the room.

1628
01:33:39,278 --> 01:33:42,534
TALIESIN: If they know that we're watching it
would disturb them.

1629
01:33:42,585 --> 01:33:45,140
LAURA: I'm going to go make sure everything's
okay.

1630
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,039
MATT: What?

1631
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:47,876
LAURA: I'm going to go listen in and make sure
everything's okay.

1632
01:33:47,876 --> 01:33:49,785
MATT: They stepped out of the tavern. They went
out into the street.

1633
01:33:49,785 --> 01:33:56,050
MARISHA: You were the one who told me that I could
not scry on Scanlan to respect his privacy so--

1634
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:59,267
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I give a shit about Scanlan.

1635
01:33:59,267 --> 01:34:01,522
LIAM: I mean, he's--

1636
01:34:01,522 --> 01:34:02,638
SAM: Nope.

1637
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,103
LIAM: Grog.

1638
01:34:04,103 --> 01:34:05,391
TRAVIS: He's not here.

1639
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:06,928
SAM: He's my best friend.

1640
01:34:06,928 --> 01:34:09,624
LIAM: He's dopey but he means well. He's all
right.

1641
01:34:09,624 --> 01:34:10,933
TRAVIS: He's fine.

1642
01:34:10,933 --> 01:34:13,686
LIAM: Okay. We don't want him to die outright.

1643
01:34:13,686 --> 01:34:15,113
LAURA: No, of course not.

1644
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:16,944
MARISHA: I don't want to watch a Tary porn.

1645
01:34:16,944 --> 01:34:19,999
TALIESIN: You don't have to watch. I just want to
watch. It's just me.

1646
01:34:19,999 --> 01:34:27,292
MARISHA: You're very strongly peer pressuring me
right now Percy and I don't know

1647
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:28,599
how I feel about this.

1648
01:34:28,599 --> 01:34:31,718
TALIESIN: It's because we're peers. I'm a bit
drunk.

1649
01:34:31,718 --> 01:34:36,983
MARISHA: Can you even scry? I don't know if you
have the--

1650
01:34:37,142 --> 01:34:38,964
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've never tried.

1651
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:40,403
MARISHA: Do you want to try?

1652
01:34:40,403 --> 01:34:41,469
TALIESIN: Yes.

1653
01:34:41,469 --> 01:34:45,661
MARISHA: All right, Percy. Try to scry. I give him
the Scrying Eye.

1654
01:34:45,661 --> 01:34:48,044
TALIESIN: Does it require attunement?

1655
01:34:48,044 --> 01:34:52,546
MATT: The Scrying Eye does not require attunement,
no. It gives the ability to use the Scry spell

1656
01:34:52,546 --> 01:34:53,657
once per day.

1657
01:34:53,657 --> 01:34:55,090
MARISHA: See what you can do.

1658
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,942
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and use it.

1659
01:34:56,942 --> 01:35:04,176
MATT: Just for the sake of this, I'm going to have
you roll a d20 and add your intelligence

1660
01:35:04,176 --> 01:35:06,294
modifier.

1661
01:35:06,294 --> 01:35:08,692
MARISHA: If he crits, I'm going to be so pissed.

1662
01:35:08,692 --> 01:35:14,332
TALIESIN: Can I use a Resolve for this?

1663
01:35:14,332 --> 01:35:16,766
MATT: Resolve is for a saving throw, right?

1664
01:35:16,766 --> 01:35:19,061
TALIESIN: No, that doesn't work, does it? That's
seven.

1665
01:35:19,061 --> 01:35:28,302
MATT: Seven? You take a moment and glance into it.
Instead of thinking of the magical orientation of

1666
01:35:28,302 --> 01:35:34,149
the ritual, your brain immediately goes to the
mechanical structure of what this would do. How

1667
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:37,605
would you recreate the scrying spell in a
mechanical fashion where it wouldn't require

1668
01:35:37,605 --> 01:35:40,343
magic. You're eventually at the point where, "I
don't understand this."

1669
01:35:40,343 --> 01:35:41,945
TALIESIN: I don't understand how this works. Never
mind.

1670
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:48,449
MARISHA: Really? Are you sure? You have to think
real hard about butt-naked Tary. Real hard.

1671
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:53,484
TALIESIN: One more time. Just bring the difficulty
up. I don't care.

1672
01:35:53,484 --> 01:35:57,068
MATT: Yeah, the DC is definitely higher. Go ahead
and roll again.

1673
01:35:57,068 --> 01:35:58,919
MARISHA: Tan lines where his armor used to be.

1674
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,528
LIAM: Luscious hair.

1675
01:36:00,528 --> 01:36:05,818
TALIESIN: There we go. 24.

1676
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:07,835
And I'm thinking about Scanlan.

1677
01:36:07,835 --> 01:36:11,674
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, you sneaky fuck!

1678
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:13,760
MATT: Okay.

1679
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,862
TALIESIN: Do you want to say this out loud?

1680
01:36:17,862 --> 01:36:20,594
MATT: You know what, guys? If I could have you
all, except for Taliesin, go ahead and step off

1681
01:36:20,594 --> 01:36:21,855
the stage.

1682
01:36:21,855 --> 01:36:23,519
ASHLEY: Do they get to know?

1683
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:25,135
MATT: Yeah. A reverse whisper.

1684
01:36:25,135 --> 01:36:27,221
TRAVIS: It's a group whisper!

1685
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:30,154
MATT: The audience gets to see this.

1686
01:36:30,154 --> 01:36:35,054
SAM: I get to stay.

1687
01:36:35,054 --> 01:36:36,677
LAURA: No!

1688
01:36:36,677 --> 01:36:39,195
MATT: Yes, you do, actually. He does get to stay.

1689
01:36:39,195 --> 01:36:41,312
SAM: I get to stay.

1690
01:36:41,312 --> 01:36:43,980
MATT: All right, guys. Close the door.

1691
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,782
TRAVIS: We're closing it!

1692
01:36:45,782 --> 01:36:48,455
SAM: They're putting headphones on.

1693
01:36:48,455 --> 01:36:50,734
TALIESIN: This is the second time in a week I've
gotten to do this to people.

1694
01:36:50,734 --> 01:36:52,727
SAM: Oh, wow! The reverse whisper!

1695
01:36:52,727 --> 01:37:02,066
MATT: As you concentrate, Percival, your vision
clarifies, and you see the moonlight over the tops

1696
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:07,353
of the trees of the Parchwood Forest around
Whitestone. The clouds break, your vision

1697
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:10,775
transitions, and all of a sudden, you're thrust
forward at a magnificent speed, beyond the forest,

1698
01:37:10,775 --> 01:37:16,866
and now you're not too far, but south of the
Parchwood. The trees disperse, and you're now

1699
01:37:16,866 --> 01:37:24,646
looking at a cluster of buildings. Maybe a few
hundred small structures, ranging from homesteads

1700
01:37:24,646 --> 01:37:32,296
to hovels. You smash cut once more, and there you
see a campfire. You see a campfire set up, maybe

1701
01:37:32,296 --> 01:37:39,595
about 25 feet between two buildings in this open
fire pit area. It's a central bonfire-type social

1702
01:37:39,595 --> 01:37:47,375
gathering place. And there, you see a number of
wooden logs set up like stools or seats, and in

1703
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:53,562
the moonlight and a few nearby torches, you see
about six or so simple farm folk that are all

1704
01:37:53,562 --> 01:38:00,769
sitting around this bonfire. Except it's not six.
It's four farm folk, and you see sitting amongst

1705
01:38:00,769 --> 01:38:07,107
them Kaylie and Scanlan. They're both together
playing music for these people who are all sitting

1706
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:11,526
and staring into the fire at the end of their work
day. It's a very simple, very serene scene,

1707
01:38:11,526 --> 01:38:18,215
strangely. They're just sitting with simple folk
in a simple town. You recognize it now: this is

1708
01:38:18,215 --> 01:38:23,732
the Turst Fields. You've been through here once
before, when you were first leaving Whitestone and

1709
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:33,459
heading south to find your quarry, all that time
ago. This is definitely a more rural area, and

1710
01:38:33,459 --> 01:38:40,011
they don't seem to be in any danger, and they
don't seem to be at any caper, but they're both at

1711
01:38:40,011 --> 01:38:44,445
the center of doing what they both do best, 
which is entertain.

1712
01:38:44,497 --> 01:38:46,507
TALIESIN: Do they look reasonable?

1713
01:38:46,507 --> 01:38:49,318
MATT: They look reasonable. You've seen them
perform before, and there is a performance face.

1714
01:38:49,318 --> 01:38:56,372
They're both wide smiles. Everyone else seems to be
enthralled by the music, or enthralled by the

1715
01:38:56,427 --> 01:39:02,356
flames and the music combination. A couple of
people saunter up and plop down on the ground,

1716
01:39:02,356 --> 01:39:07,448
sitting next to them to join in, and they're
drawing a small crowd at the end of the day.

1717
01:39:07,448 --> 01:39:10,859
TALIESIN: I take down as many details in my head
as I can.

1718
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:15,156
MATT: Okay. Bring them back in. Guys, get back
here!

1719
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:17,484
SAM: Or should we just take our break here?

1720
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:20,523
MATT: What time is it? It is 8:30! We'll go ahead
and take our break, actually.

1721
01:39:20,523 --> 01:39:22,011
TALIESIN: Thanks, guys.

1722
01:39:22,011 --> 01:39:29,553
MATT: All right. We'll take our break real fast.
We have our giveaway. We have the bubinga complete

1723
01:39:29,553 --> 01:39:38,843
system and tabletop tray from Wyrmwood. This one
has a bunch of stuff. We have a dice box, dice

1724
01:39:38,843 --> 01:39:44,419
tray-- this is actually a pretty legit giveaway,
so go ahead and make sure you come to the Twitch

1725
01:39:44,419 --> 01:39:48,297
chat room and be active. They'll have a password
up there. Do we have a code yet for the chat

1726
01:39:48,297 --> 01:39:49,489
room?

1727
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:50,518
CREW: Pike.

1728
01:39:50,518 --> 01:39:56,233
MATT: Pike. P-I-K-E. Pike is the code in the chat
room. Go ahead and enter that in the Twitch chat,

1729
01:39:56,233 --> 01:39:59,172
and we'll pick a winner as soon as we come back
from our break. See you guys here in just a

1730
01:39:59,172 --> 01:40:00,889
moment.

1731
01:40:00,889 --> 01:54:43,500
[break]

1732
01:54:43,609 --> 01:54:50,520
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. As you guys are
having your drinks at the bar, Percival finishes

1733
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:56,074
focusing briefly on the Scrying Orb and
disengages.

1734
01:54:56,074 --> 01:54:59,445
TALIESIN: Ha! Oh, that's a bit much. That's a bit
much.

1735
01:54:59,445 --> 01:55:00,483
MARISHA: That's right.

1736
01:55:00,483 --> 01:55:01,737
ASHLEY: What did you see?

1737
01:55:01,737 --> 01:55:05,122
TALIESIN: Nothing that interesting. Ugh, that
doesn't feel good.

1738
01:55:05,122 --> 01:55:08,324
MARISHA: Nothing that interesting, or something
appallingly interesting?

1739
01:55:08,324 --> 01:55:13,217
TALIESIN: Believe me, I'd tell you if it was
appalling. It was not appalling, it was fine.

1740
01:55:13,217 --> 01:55:14,915
LIAM: Is Tary okay? What are you thinking, man?

1741
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:19,422
TALIESIN: He's fine, he's having a good-- That
doesn't feel good. How do you do that? Ugh.

1742
01:55:19,422 --> 01:55:21,664
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

1743
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:23,163
MATT: Why?

1744
01:55:23,163 --> 01:55:26,424
MARISHA: Just to see if he actually saw anything
or not.

1745
01:55:26,424 --> 01:55:27,847
MATT: Sure, go for it.

1746
01:55:27,847 --> 01:55:32,170
MARISHA: If he's telling us the truth. 26.

1747
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:37,008
TALIESIN: All right, and that would be-- okay.

1748
01:55:37,008 --> 01:55:38,220
MARISHA: Sorry, 27.

1749
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:39,789
TRAVIS: The question, was if you saw anything or
not?

1750
01:55:39,789 --> 01:55:40,987
TALIESIN: Yeah. Four.

1751
01:55:40,987 --> 01:55:44,317
MATT: So yeah, it seems like he definitely saw
something.

1752
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:50,800
MARISHA: What? It worked, though!

1753
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,332
TALIESIN: It did.

1754
01:55:52,332 --> 01:55:55,291
MARISHA: You actually got it to work for you! I'm
kind of impressed.

1755
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:58,253
TALIESIN: I don't think I'm ever doing that again,
but yes. That doesn't feeling good.

1756
01:55:58,253 --> 01:56:00,069
LIAM: He crossed the threshold? Is that what you
saw?

1757
01:56:00,069 --> 01:56:01,751
TALIESIN: I didn't see that.

1758
01:56:01,751 --> 01:56:02,906
LIAM: What did you see?

1759
01:56:02,906 --> 01:56:06,796
TALIESIN: I'm going to be a gentleman and not
throw up from the speed at which one goes in that

1760
01:56:06,796 --> 01:56:07,956
direction.

1761
01:56:07,956 --> 01:56:10,659
LIAM: Well, Percival, you threw "gentleman" out
the window about 30 seconds ago.

1762
01:56:10,659 --> 01:56:14,464
TALIESIN: That's fair. He's doing very well.

1763
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,602
LIAM: All right.

1764
01:56:15,602 --> 01:56:17,437
TALIESIN: Very well. I'm very proud.

1765
01:56:17,437 --> 01:56:21,906
TRAVIS: So question, do we crash here for the
night or do we make it back to the (hiccup)

1766
01:56:21,906 --> 01:56:23,215
castle?

1767
01:56:23,215 --> 01:56:25,457
TALIESIN: We should probably go to the castle.

1768
01:56:25,457 --> 01:56:28,105
LIAM: You've got to say hi to your sister.

1769
01:56:28,105 --> 01:56:35,245
TALIESIN: I do. We've sent word. They'll be awake,
I imagine. Is Gilmore still in town?

1770
01:56:35,245 --> 01:56:41,911
MATT: Last you heard-- you can ask around--
Gilmore is back in Emon currently trying to

1771
01:56:41,911 --> 01:56:45,737
scavenge the pieces of his shop.

1772
01:56:45,737 --> 01:56:50,136
TRAVIS: Why don't we do it old school and just
crash here for the night? That way, Tary can

1773
01:56:50,136 --> 01:56:55,107
take his time and in the morning we (hiccup) oh
god I got so much burps-- Then in the morning we

1774
01:56:55,165 --> 01:56:56,797
can head back out.

1775
01:56:56,797 --> 01:57:00,250
TALIESIN: Head back out, where?

1776
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:03,410
TRAVIS: To the (hiccup) castle.

1777
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:06,893
SAM: Those are real hiccups, aren't they?

1778
01:57:06,893 --> 01:57:12,168
TRAVIS: These fucking peanuts are amazing. Not
sure what I'm eating, but I think they're peanuts.

1779
01:57:12,389 --> 01:57:14,180
Might be nails.

1780
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:18,670
TALIESIN: We have both, so that's, either way, it
could work.

1781
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:26,959
LIAM: I can sleep anywhere, but why aren't we
going to sleep in the nice beds in the castle?

1782
01:57:26,959 --> 01:57:29,137
TALIESIN: We have lovely beds.

1783
01:57:29,137 --> 01:57:31,410
TRAVIS: But we've got to wait on Tary!

1784
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:33,146
LAURA: Yeah, he's not going to know where we
went.

1785
01:57:33,146 --> 01:57:35,713
MARISHA: Tary's a big boy.

1786
01:57:35,713 --> 01:57:36,934
TRAVIS: Is he?

1787
01:57:36,934 --> 01:57:38,168
MARISHA: You're right, he's not.

1788
01:57:38,168 --> 01:57:40,833
LIAM: We'll leave a message here. He's a smart
boy.

1789
01:57:40,833 --> 01:57:45,297
ASHLEY: I feel like he's just so romantic, he'll
probably stay the night and have breakfast or

1790
01:57:45,297 --> 01:57:46,426
something.

1791
01:57:46,426 --> 01:57:53,349
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, you may go back to your fluffy
bed, but my man's in the deed and I'm sticking

1792
01:57:53,349 --> 01:57:55,900
around to slap hands afterwards.

1793
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,853
LAURA: Is Shauna around at all?

1794
01:57:57,853 --> 01:57:59,570
MATT: Yeah, she's in the process of running
around.

1795
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:01,140
LAURA: Can I run up and snag her for a second?

1796
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:07,717
MATT: Sure. She sets down a couple of drinks. "I
feel like we did our good deed for the night."

1797
01:58:07,717 --> 01:58:14,836
LAURA: I feel like it happened. It definitely
happened. Question, though. How long does your

1798
01:58:14,836 --> 01:58:20,772
friend usually stay with her cohorts? Does it-- Is
it--

1799
01:58:20,772 --> 01:58:23,868
MATT: "I don't time it, if that's what your
question is. I don't know!"

1800
01:58:23,868 --> 01:58:29,802
LAURA: Does she spend the night with them, or is
it like an in and out-- Do you see her again,

1801
01:58:29,802 --> 01:58:31,336
around, quickly?

1802
01:58:31,336 --> 01:58:33,125
MATT: "A few times, it depends on--"

1803
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:34,124
LAURA: It depends.

1804
01:58:34,124 --> 01:58:35,016
MATT: "I don't know."

1805
01:58:35,016 --> 01:58:35,911
LAURA: On the guy.

1806
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:38,284
MATT: "She's a hard working girl, let her have her
fun."

1807
01:58:38,284 --> 01:58:48,722
LAURA: I agree with that sentiment. Thank you for
your generosity, and your connections.

1808
01:58:48,893 --> 01:58:50,923
TRAVIS: Silver tongued, huh.

1809
01:58:50,923 --> 01:58:54,982
LAURA: Also, I'm sorry for my friends, and for
me.

1810
01:58:55,036 --> 01:58:58,915
(laughter)

1811
01:58:58,915 --> 01:59:04,710
MATT: At that point, she smiles very widely and
you can see the mother poke through for a minute

1812
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:12,309
from the barmaid. She nods and says, "Look, it's
all right. Trust me, I deal with far worse from

1813
01:59:12,309 --> 01:59:17,499
"most of these riffraff." She points to most of the
other tables. "It's fine."

1814
01:59:17,499 --> 01:59:18,901
LAURA: Thank you.

1815
01:59:18,901 --> 01:59:21,478
MATT: She gets back to work.

1816
01:59:21,478 --> 01:59:28,509
LAURA: I dunno, I think he might be with her a
long time. He might be learning a few things. It

1817
01:59:28,509 --> 01:59:30,345
could take all night.

1818
01:59:30,345 --> 01:59:32,499
MARISHA: I hope he's learning a lot of things.

1819
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:34,923
LAURA: I mean, did it look like he was?

1820
01:59:34,923 --> 01:59:38,006
TALIESIN: I was not there very long.

1821
01:59:38,006 --> 01:59:44,461
MARISHA: Let's just go back to the castle. It's
just a few blocks away from the tavern. We can

1822
01:59:44,461 --> 01:59:50,637
always come back in the morning to send someone to
get him, it's fine. It's a small West--

1823
01:59:50,637 --> 01:59:56,533
Whitestone-- we're not in Westruun. We've
traveled. We've traveled a lot.

1824
01:59:56,533 --> 01:59:58,317
MATT: You're four mugs in, Keyleth.

1825
01:59:58,317 --> 02:00:03,643
MARISHA: God, is it just, you know, we travel so
much, you don't really know--

1826
02:00:03,643 --> 02:00:06,480
LAURA: Really, really far in for Keyleth,
actually.

1827
02:00:06,538 --> 02:00:11,056
LIAM: That is so many glasses that she's far in.

1828
02:00:11,056 --> 02:00:23,040
ASHLEY: Well, because I am not as tired as you
guys-- I have been working so hard, but I'm going

1829
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:25,267
to stay.

1830
02:00:25,364 --> 02:00:26,803
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

1831
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:29,168
ASHLEY: Gonna wait for Tary.

1832
02:00:29,168 --> 02:00:35,968
TRAVIS: (belches) Keep an eye on our
34,000 gold-onaire. Sorry, it smells like a fart.

1833
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:39,599
LAURA: Gross.

1834
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,901
SAM: Welcome back, Ashley.

1835
02:00:42,062 --> 02:00:44,615
(laughter)

1836
02:00:44,615 --> 02:00:46,888
ASHLEY: Hey, he's my best friend and I love all of
him.

1837
02:00:46,888 --> 02:00:49,772
LIAM: That's fair, you probably have some catching
up to do.

1838
02:00:49,772 --> 02:00:56,202
MATT: You guys are finding your respective places
to stay for the night?

1839
02:00:56,202 --> 02:01:00,207
LIAM: Back to the castle, yeah.

1840
02:01:00,207 --> 02:01:04,340
MATT: All right. The four of you head back to the
castle. The two of you stay in the tavern. Taryon

1841
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:11,759
continues with his evening. The four of you make
it back. Is there anything in particular you want

1842
02:01:11,759 --> 02:01:15,524
to do? At this point in the evening, you've been
drinking quite a ways, so it's closer to midnight

1843
02:01:15,524 --> 02:01:16,589
at this point in time.

1844
02:01:16,589 --> 02:01:26,126
TALIESIN: I'm a little soberer than I'd like to
let on. Not sober, but-- I don't quite want to say

1845
02:01:26,126 --> 02:01:33,434
surprise for tomorrow, but I may have something
exciting to show you tomorrow. I'm going to need

1846
02:01:33,434 --> 02:01:37,319
you to be extra intimidating tonight, because
tomorrow I'm going to be very intimidating right

1847
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:38,737
back at you.

1848
02:01:38,737 --> 02:01:39,942
LAURA: I like this plan.

1849
02:01:39,942 --> 02:01:46,089
TALIESIN: I figured you would. I'm going to have
to say hello to my sister.

1850
02:01:46,089 --> 02:01:50,833
LAURA: Yes. Do I need to come with you?

1851
02:01:50,833 --> 02:01:54,714
TALIESIN: No. Are we alone?

1852
02:01:54,714 --> 02:01:58,829
MATT: You guys could fall behind the two of them
if you want.

1853
02:01:58,829 --> 02:02:04,434
TALIESIN: I didn't look in on Tary.

1854
02:02:04,434 --> 02:02:06,239
LAURA: You didn't?

1855
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:07,365
TALIESIN: No.

1856
02:02:07,365 --> 02:02:09,188
LAURA: Did you not see anything?

1857
02:02:09,188 --> 02:02:11,259
TALIESIN: (sighs)

1858
02:02:11,259 --> 02:02:13,817
LAURA: What did you do?

1859
02:02:13,817 --> 02:02:17,266
TALIESIN: I saw Scanlan.

1860
02:02:17,266 --> 02:02:23,396
LAURA: You seemed bothered after you looked. Is
everything all right?

1861
02:02:23,396 --> 02:02:25,490
TALIESIN: He's fine.

1862
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:26,876
LAURA: What was he doing?

1863
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:29,258
TALIESIN: I haven't done anything yet.

1864
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,289
LAURA: What was <i>he</i> doing?

1865
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:43,402
TALIESIN: Enjoying himself. God knows. He has
things that belong to me.

1866
02:02:43,454 --> 02:02:46,024
LAURA: Like what?

1867
02:02:46,024 --> 02:02:48,678
TALIESIN: He has the stone--

1868
02:02:48,678 --> 02:02:51,373
LAURA: I sort of gave that to him.

1869
02:02:51,373 --> 02:02:52,368
TALIESIN: Did we?

1870
02:02:52,368 --> 02:02:53,959
LAURA: I did.

1871
02:02:53,959 --> 02:02:56,090
TALIESIN: He has the earring.

1872
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:57,789
LAURA: Yes.

1873
02:02:57,789 --> 02:03:02,225
TALIESIN: I kind of want them back.

1874
02:03:02,225 --> 02:03:09,048
LAURA: You don't think there's any chance he'll
ever come back, do you?

1875
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:22,394
TALIESIN: I think that if he did come back, I
would be very worried about who he was. I'm

1876
02:03:22,394 --> 02:03:36,298
feeling betrayed, and I can't help but think of
all of our adventures of the last few weeks, he

1877
02:03:36,298 --> 02:03:44,637
would have been oddly useful for so many of them.
He would have been such a-- Hm.

1878
02:03:44,637 --> 02:03:55,519
LAURA: You know, it's funny, he left feeling like
we didn't appreciate his worth, and these last

1879
02:03:55,577 --> 02:04:07,743
few weeks have really made me understand how much
I did. I think he hit on a lot of really good

1880
02:04:07,743 --> 02:04:19,358
points when he left us. I don't forgive him for
them just yet, but I'm trying

1881
02:04:19,358 --> 02:04:23,580
not to hate him for it.

1882
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:38,461
TALIESIN: I'm not. I've been that villain, and the
best of them point out all of your flaws while

1883
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:51,394
they're busy exploiting their own. I am, I will
admit, very angry. I don't want to interfere with

1884
02:04:51,394 --> 02:04:57,865
his happiness, I don't want to interfere with his
life, certainly not his daughter, but I will admit

1885
02:04:57,865 --> 02:05:07,605
I am very angry. Perhaps the only thing that's
keeping me from doing anything about that anger is

1886
02:05:07,605 --> 02:05:12,912
your opinion of it. I don't mean to put this on
you, this is not on you, but--

1887
02:05:12,912 --> 02:05:15,152
LAURA: Not at all, dear.

1888
02:05:15,152 --> 02:05:19,304
TALIESIN: I'm thinking of collecting what's mine.

1889
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:29,930
LAURA: I pull out Fenthras, and I show him again
what I've carved on the front of it. Sinaeth. Do

1890
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:34,145
you remember when I told you about this?

1891
02:05:34,357 --> 02:05:36,353
TALIESIN: Yes.

1892
02:05:36,353 --> 02:05:44,373
LAURA: It's important. I struggle with it a lot,
you know. I tend to hold grudges.

1893
02:05:44,373 --> 02:05:48,062
TALIESIN: As do I.

1894
02:05:48,062 --> 02:06:02,497
LAURA: If we're trying, that's important. Just
think on it. Nothing rash, dear, all right?

1895
02:06:02,497 --> 02:06:15,365
TALIESIN: I'll think on it. I'll think on it.
Thank you.

1896
02:06:15,365 --> 02:06:18,813
LAURA: Yeah. I'll be in the room.

1897
02:06:18,813 --> 02:06:29,787
TALIESIN: I'll be right there. I'm going to confer
with my sister about formalizing a few things

1898
02:06:29,787 --> 02:06:31,312
tomorrow.

1899
02:06:31,312 --> 02:06:32,356
MATT: Okay.

1900
02:06:32,356 --> 02:06:38,974
MARISHA: Before Percy leaves, I say, (slurs) You
know, didn't think, going to be able to use the

1901
02:06:38,974 --> 02:06:52,271
Scrying Eye, for someone who hates magic so much,
might be something more to you! Boop! I saw that

1902
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:59,544
from Whatsherface earlier! Okay, bye, go have
fun!

1903
02:06:59,544 --> 02:07:09,300
LIAM: I want to jump us back two minutes, and I'm
not as sober as Percival, and we're arm-in-arm

1904
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:19,208
walking. Man, I'm so fucking happy right now, I'm
so fucking happy. We have nothing to do. We have

1905
02:07:19,208 --> 02:07:20,959
nothing to do!

1906
02:07:20,959 --> 02:07:24,903
MARISHA: (slurs) I just can't believe Percy
actually used the Scrying Eye. I so didn't

1907
02:07:24,903 --> 02:07:29,517
anticipate him actually getting it able to work. I
thought I was one of the only ones in the group

1908
02:07:29,517 --> 02:07:32,116
that can make it work, and now he can make it
work.

1909
02:07:32,116 --> 02:07:40,662
LIAM: Well he's a clever boy, that one. Listen to
me. I don't have any kind of timetable on it-- and

1910
02:07:40,662 --> 02:07:48,113
I take her cheeks and I go (burbling noise) I'm so
drunk right now. I can't wait to go home with you.

1911
02:07:48,113 --> 02:07:55,284
I can't wait. I dunno when we're going to do it.
Your home! Your home.

1912
02:07:55,284 --> 02:07:58,611
MARISHA: Man. What are-- I don't know what you're
referring to in this moment.

1913
02:07:58,611 --> 02:07:59,912
LIAM: I mean, Zephra.

1914
02:07:59,912 --> 02:08:01,508
MARISHA: This feels like a lot of meta
conversations.

1915
02:08:01,508 --> 02:08:04,983
LIAM: Zephra. I want to go to Zephra. I want to
get to know your father!

1916
02:08:04,983 --> 02:08:06,131
MARISHA: Yeah!

1917
02:08:06,131 --> 02:08:10,169
LIAM: He's nice! He's so much nicer than my father
ever was!

1918
02:08:10,169 --> 02:08:13,915
MARISHA: You're so domestic right now, it's so
cute!

1919
02:08:13,915 --> 02:08:15,218
LIAM: Tiddly diddly dee!

1920
02:08:15,218 --> 02:08:19,586
(laughter)

1921
02:08:19,586 --> 02:08:29,488
LIAM: You know, there's been no time to talk about
this. I mean, we get to--

1922
02:08:29,488 --> 02:08:34,222
MARISHA: Hey, do you think they're going to stop
allowing you to drink in the street as soon as we

1923
02:08:34,222 --> 02:08:38,660
get guards and law and order back in this town? I
kind of like you being able to drink in the street

1924
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:41,727
in Whitestone. It's nice.

1925
02:08:41,727 --> 02:08:43,997
LIAM: Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.

1926
02:08:43,997 --> 02:08:45,733
MARISHA: What were you going to say?

1927
02:08:45,733 --> 02:08:48,261
LIAM: Focus in on me, because I have something
important to tell you, but I know that we're both

1928
02:08:48,261 --> 02:08:49,914
very intoxicated.

1929
02:08:49,914 --> 02:08:51,319
MARISHA: No, I'm listening.

1930
02:08:51,319 --> 02:08:52,805
LIAM: Okay. Listen.

1931
02:08:52,805 --> 02:08:54,820
MARISHA: I'm listening!

1932
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:57,635
LIAM: Yes, but, Kiki, listen to me.

1933
02:08:57,635 --> 02:08:59,159
MARISHA: Mm-hm!

1934
02:08:59,159 --> 02:09:12,229
LIAM: The Raven Queen is not done with me or with
us.

1935
02:09:12,229 --> 02:09:14,537
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1936
02:09:14,537 --> 02:09:18,563
LIAM: You know, when she picked me up again, when
you--

1937
02:09:18,563 --> 02:09:20,571
MARISHA: She picked you up again?

1938
02:09:20,571 --> 02:09:24,230
LIAM: When you brought me back, when Vex brought
me back, when Grog brought me back--

1939
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:26,734
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. Uh-huh.

1940
02:09:26,734 --> 02:09:28,706
LIAM: She went (poof).

1941
02:09:28,706 --> 02:09:34,008
MARISHA: Yeah! I thought I was crazy, but
apparently your sister saw her face, because we

1942
02:09:34,008 --> 02:09:35,508
all saw her face!

1943
02:09:35,508 --> 02:09:43,514
LIAM: Yeah. Then she went away, but then she
didn't go away. She was still there. She's not

1944
02:09:43,514 --> 02:09:46,096
done. So fucking drunk.

1945
02:09:46,096 --> 02:09:49,722
MARISHA: Yeah, me too! I'm trying to concentrate
on what you're saying so hard!

1946
02:09:49,722 --> 02:09:56,629
LIAM: But I don't want to think about that. That's
later. That's coming, I guess. That's later.

1947
02:09:56,629 --> 02:09:57,698
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1948
02:09:57,698 --> 02:09:59,412
LIAM: But I want to--

1949
02:09:59,412 --> 02:10:01,707
MARISHA: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1950
02:10:01,707 --> 02:10:02,982
LIAM: What?

1951
02:10:02,982 --> 02:10:13,268
MARISHA: No feathery white mask face wearing deity
is going to take you from me or us, okay? Okay?

1952
02:10:13,268 --> 02:10:21,482
Because we'll just go god-hunting! And it'll be
great! Because apparently your sister said we have

1953
02:10:21,482 --> 02:10:24,214
to kill Orcus, so--

1954
02:10:24,284 --> 02:10:26,522
LIAM: Yeah, that's a pretty big matzoh ball, that
one.

1955
02:10:26,522 --> 02:10:33,078
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm still digesting that, so I
think the only way I can really interface with it

1956
02:10:33,078 --> 02:10:35,137
is just by making jest of it.

1957
02:10:35,137 --> 02:10:37,735
LIAM: I'm going to change the subject though one
more time and then we've got to go to bed soon

1958
02:10:37,735 --> 02:10:39,424
because I am fucked up.

1959
02:10:39,424 --> 02:10:40,890
MARISHA: I'm listening.

1960
02:10:40,890 --> 02:10:46,671
LIAM: I'm in the short term more confused and
worried about my sister.

1961
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:49,883
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. Yeah.

1962
02:10:49,883 --> 02:10:57,586
LIAM: Because there's no question that I'm going
to follow you where you go right now, but I don't

1963
02:10:57,586 --> 02:11:00,842
know what she wants to do.

1964
02:11:00,842 --> 02:11:02,931
MARISHA: Oh.

1965
02:11:02,931 --> 02:11:05,121
LIAM: And I love her so much!

1966
02:11:05,121 --> 02:11:06,127
MARISHA: Oh!

1967
02:11:06,127 --> 02:11:09,327
(laughter)

1968
02:11:09,327 --> 02:11:10,804
LIAM: She's my best friend!

1969
02:11:10,804 --> 02:11:14,322
MARISHA: I know! I love her so much too!

1970
02:11:14,322 --> 02:11:15,523
LIAM: She's the coolest!

1971
02:11:15,523 --> 02:11:21,731
MARISHA: She is so cool! And she is so pretty!
She's so cool.

1972
02:11:21,731 --> 02:11:26,757
LIAM: So I don't know how that conversation's
going to go, but, you know, it's going to happen.

1973
02:11:26,757 --> 02:11:28,393
MARISHA: I'm so sorry!

1974
02:11:28,393 --> 02:11:33,939
MATT: As you guys both look ahead to talk about
and look at Vex, she's gone and Percy's gone, and

1975
02:11:33,939 --> 02:11:37,379
you realize at this point that you completely
missed the divergence of your party.

1976
02:11:37,379 --> 02:11:42,291
LIAM: Stubby! Let's go to bed.

1977
02:11:42,291 --> 02:11:44,186
MARISHA: Okay! They're okay, right?

1978
02:11:44,186 --> 02:11:47,879
LIAM: Those two? They've got it all figured out!

1979
02:11:47,879 --> 02:11:56,654
MARISHA: I know some-- it's been bad, you know?
Turned around a lot, and people have not been

1980
02:11:56,654 --> 02:12:00,376
there, and they're supposed to be there, and
they're not--

1981
02:12:00,376 --> 02:12:01,581
LIAM: Come here.

1982
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:04,003
MATT: You guys make your way to your room in
Whitestone.

1983
02:12:04,003 --> 02:12:05,120
MARISHA: I'm so drunk!

1984
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:09,048
LIAM: At the door, press foreheads together and I
go, I'm going to pretend like I'm not drunk.

1985
02:12:09,048 --> 02:12:11,737
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know if I can!

1986
02:12:11,737 --> 02:12:12,741
LIAM: Okay.

1987
02:12:12,741 --> 02:12:13,800
MARISHA: Okay.

1988
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,025
LIAM: I love you so much.

1989
02:12:15,025 --> 02:12:16,304
MARISHA: I love you so much.

1990
02:12:16,304 --> 02:12:18,701
LIAM: Time to go to bed.

1991
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:19,682
MARISHA: Okay.

1992
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:28,442
MATT: Percival. The castle's dark, it's quiet. The
few lights that are up in the sconces on the

1993
02:12:28,442 --> 02:12:33,089
secondary floor as you make your way towards your
sister's chambers. You come to the door, and her

1994
02:12:33,089 --> 02:12:40,797
personal guard is there, in Pale Guard armor. As
soon as you begin to approach the steps, gets into

1995
02:12:40,797 --> 02:12:44,722
a defensive position and then recognizes you and
steps back and leads you in. As you come inside,

1996
02:12:44,722 --> 02:12:52,463
you see Cassandra is currently in her regular
day-to-day clothing, one of her many outfits she

1997
02:12:52,463 --> 02:12:58,451
uses for formal meetings. Her hair is a little
frazzled and down in front of her face. She has a

1998
02:12:58,451 --> 02:13:04,621
stack of sheets stacked up next to her at this
small desk table that she has in front of one of her

1999
02:13:04,687 --> 02:13:09,520
large red velvet sitting chairs. However, she's
not looking at that right now, as she's currently

2000
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:18,436
enthralled with what looks to be a small stack of
cakes and a little tea saucer she's holding up as

2001
02:13:18,436 --> 02:13:20,113
she's sipping.

2002
02:13:20,113 --> 02:13:23,239
TALIESIN: There's just layers to that trouble,
isn't there? Just layers of paperwork.

2003
02:13:23,239 --> 02:13:26,706
MATT: She turns back and looks at you. You see a
little bit of the cake curl at the edge of her

2004
02:13:26,706 --> 02:13:34,170
mouth. "Percival!" Takes another sip of the tea
and sets it down. "You've returned!"

2005
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:37,646
TALIESIN: For a while, this time.

2006
02:13:37,646 --> 02:13:41,246
MATT: "How have your travels been?"

2007
02:13:41,246 --> 02:13:44,134
TALIESIN: Terrible, but all over.

2008
02:13:44,134 --> 02:13:46,933
MATT: "That sounds par for the course, I assume."

2009
02:13:46,933 --> 02:13:52,598
TALIESIN: I'm back to help. It's my turn.

2010
02:13:52,598 --> 02:13:58,817
MATT: "Good! As the sophist of native ingenuity,
you have much responsibility in this time of

2011
02:13:58,817 --> 02:14:02,011
"recovery, and I'm growing a bit weary of the
burden."

2012
02:14:02,073 --> 02:14:09,420
TALIESIN: I will happily take some layers of both
that paperwork and that cake off your hands.

2013
02:14:09,492 --> 02:14:11,109
And I grab a slice.

2014
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:13,037
MATT: She hands it over to you.

2015
02:14:13,037 --> 02:14:21,147
TALIESIN: I do ask tomorrow that we handle this
little interesting tidbit. I hand her the

2016
02:14:21,147 --> 02:14:25,473
documents I put together earlier with the titling
that needs to be dealt with.

2017
02:14:25,473 --> 02:14:37,249
MATT: She takes it and goes, "Huh. Grand Poobah,
that's-- we'll certainly discuss that."

2018
02:14:37,249 --> 02:14:41,790
TALIESIN: I expect somebody will come up with
something delightful for that one.

2019
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:51,836
MATT: "We can take our time with that one. I'm not
going to lie, it's been so long, I've forgotten we

2020
02:14:51,836 --> 02:14:57,266
have not had any purveyor of the Grey Hunt."

2021
02:14:57,266 --> 02:15:00,546
TALIESIN: Quite a while. A long while.

2022
02:15:00,546 --> 02:15:02,644
MATT: "So, Vex'ahlia."

2023
02:15:02,644 --> 02:15:07,792
TALIESIN: It seemed appropriate. Even before
things became what they are, yes.

2024
02:15:07,792 --> 02:15:11,641
MATT: "Before we can officiate that she has to
undergo the Hunt itself."

2025
02:15:11,641 --> 02:15:12,937
TALIESIN: Yes.

2026
02:15:12,937 --> 02:15:14,646
MATT: "I don't know how that works."

2027
02:15:14,646 --> 02:15:15,815
TALIESIN: I--

2028
02:15:15,815 --> 02:15:18,971
MATT: "Keeper Yennen might."

2029
02:15:18,971 --> 02:15:20,994
TALIESIN: He does, if I recall.

2030
02:15:20,994 --> 02:15:27,748
MATT: "Keeper Yennen should know. I'm a bit out of
my depth at this point. I've done--" You see she

2031
02:15:27,748 --> 02:15:33,135
sighs deeply and looks over at her garden-- For
the first time in a while, you see Cassandra break

2032
02:15:33,135 --> 02:15:37,614
from the stoic leader to Cassandra, your sister,
and she leans forward and takes your hand and

2033
02:15:37,614 --> 02:15:46,335
goes, "I'm so very tired. I've missed you. I need
your help. Please."

2034
02:15:46,335 --> 02:15:54,341
TALIESIN: We're going to make this right. We're
going to-- the machine will run again. All of this

2035
02:15:54,341 --> 02:15:56,469
will work again.

2036
02:15:56,469 --> 02:16:02,740
MATT: "I know. They're good people, many good
people here, and you've all saw to that. I've saw

2037
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:08,212
"to it. I need rest."

2038
02:16:08,314 --> 02:16:10,337
TALIESIN: I will help.

2039
02:16:10,337 --> 02:16:14,546
MATT: "Thank you. There's more cake in it for
you."

2040
02:16:14,546 --> 02:16:17,069
TALIESIN: I could use more cake.

2041
02:16:17,069 --> 02:16:21,950
MATT: She wipes a little tear from her face. "I'm
glad you're safe."

2042
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:26,819
TALIESIN: How goes the training of the company of
shot?

2043
02:16:26,819 --> 02:16:35,544
MATT: "It's functional as it can be. We're having
to ration ammunition as we have to rely on you for

2044
02:16:35,605 --> 02:16:37,183
"that and you've been gone."

2045
02:16:37,183 --> 02:16:38,942
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to fix that as well.

2046
02:16:38,942 --> 02:16:46,242
MATT: "Perhaps you should helm most of that
training since the majority effort has been at the

2047
02:16:46,242 --> 02:16:49,070
"hip and making things up as they go."

2048
02:16:49,239 --> 02:16:52,931
TALIESIN: The guards? The captain of the guards
has been taking care of everything?

2049
02:16:52,931 --> 02:17:01,072
MATT: "Yes, yes. We lost a few in the last
altercations but we have a good long standing

2050
02:17:01,072 --> 02:17:07,287
"number of individuals who have stepped up and what
was his name? The one that you brought in?"

2051
02:17:07,287 --> 02:17:08,572
TALIESIN: Jarett.

2052
02:17:08,572 --> 02:17:09,794
MATT: "Jarett."

2053
02:17:09,794 --> 02:17:11,279
TALIESIN: Is he still around?

2054
02:17:11,279 --> 02:17:15,496
MATT: "He's been very useful. He's taken care of
most of the low-end training but--"

2055
02:17:15,496 --> 02:17:19,137
(laughter)

2056
02:17:19,137 --> 02:17:25,177
TALIESIN: I would like to confer with him very
quickly before I go to sleep but other than that

2057
02:17:25,177 --> 02:17:29,080
we are back and I look forward to making this move
forward tomorrow morning.

2058
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:40,254
MATT: "Good. Yes. Bring--" She takes the sheet.
"Lady Vex'ahlia to breakfast in the morning and we

2059
02:17:40,306 --> 02:17:45,361
"shall discuss her position, responsibilities, and
the necessity of the Hunt."

2060
02:17:45,361 --> 02:17:49,375
TALIESIN: I will. Thank you.

2061
02:17:49,375 --> 02:18:00,148
MATT: "Of course." She leans back in her chair and
(sighs). "I think it's time for bed." And she gets

2062
02:18:00,202 --> 02:18:05,101
up and she goes and closes off the fireplace in
the corner and throws a little bit of water onto

2063
02:18:05,101 --> 02:18:08,440
it and puts out the candles in the room.

2064
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:12,708
TALIESIN: I'm going to run by Jarett's on the way
back to my quarters.

2065
02:18:12,711 --> 02:18:16,262
LAURA: I ran to Jared's.

2066
02:18:16,333 --> 02:18:19,449
MARISHA AND MATT: (sing) It can only be Jared's.

2067
02:18:19,449 --> 02:18:24,655
MATT: Jarett-- Jarett doesn't stay in the castle.
Jarett currently stays down in the barracks within

2068
02:18:24,725 --> 02:18:27,792
the city of Whitestone proper because he's
responsible for training the recruits and helping

2069
02:18:27,857 --> 02:18:29,182
build up their skills.

2070
02:18:29,182 --> 02:18:32,646
TALIESIN: All right. Real quick, I'm just going to
write a little post. I'm just going to write a

2071
02:18:32,646 --> 02:18:37,580
little letter which I will tell you about in--
well, should I tell you what it is now because the

2072
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:38,746
person who sent it--

2073
02:18:38,746 --> 02:18:40,013
SAM: Do we all need to leave?

2074
02:18:40,013 --> 02:18:41,099
TALIESIN: No. Well, yes, you all need--

2075
02:18:41,099 --> 02:18:42,635
(laughter)

2076
02:18:42,635 --> 02:18:45,356
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw a little cash and I'm
going to write a little letter. I'm going to ask

2077
02:18:45,356 --> 02:18:46,856
Jared to very very quietly--

2078
02:18:46,856 --> 02:18:47,972
LAURA: Jarett.

2079
02:18:47,972 --> 02:18:50,293
TALIESIN: Jarett. So sorry. Jarett. I know.

2080
02:18:50,293 --> 02:18:52,009
SAM: Dear Jarett, get me some drugs.

2081
02:18:52,009 --> 02:19:00,811
TALIESIN: Very quietly on the sly hire someone to
keep very, very distant tabs on Scanlan

2082
02:19:00,811 --> 02:19:02,196
Shorthalt.

2083
02:19:02,196 --> 02:19:03,372
MATT: Okay.

2084
02:19:03,372 --> 02:19:08,265
TALIESIN: I want to know if anything unusual
happens. Not to interfere. Just watch.

2085
02:19:08,317 --> 02:19:13,742
LIAM: (Capone voice) I want him dead. I want his
family dead. I want his house burned to the ground!

2086
02:19:13,794 --> 02:19:16,260
MATT: How much money to do you attach to the
letter?

2087
02:19:16,312 --> 02:19:17,723
SAM: Five gold.

2088
02:19:17,723 --> 02:19:18,982
TALIESIN: Five gold pieces.

2089
02:19:18,982 --> 02:19:20,466
MATT: 16 copper.

2090
02:19:20,466 --> 02:19:25,541
TALIESIN: Where was my-- I'm trying to find my
number. I was going to shoot about 400 gold at it

2091
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:27,813
just to get it done. Seems reasonable.

2092
02:19:27,813 --> 02:19:29,718
MATT: That could probably get it done. For a
while.

2093
02:19:29,718 --> 02:19:31,421
TALIESIN: Yeah, until he needs more.

2094
02:19:31,421 --> 02:19:36,894
MATT: Okay. He's a smart man. He's done different
forms of business. He can let you know if you need

2095
02:19:36,894 --> 02:19:45,206
to restock the coffers, if you will. So the
letter's written up, assuredly delivered, and the

2096
02:19:45,206 --> 02:19:52,263
evening comes to a close for you guys. At the
tavern, here at the Tipsy Quorum, we have Pike and

2097
02:19:52,263 --> 02:19:57,045
Grog catching up on crazy business amongst the
rest of the jovial atmosphere of the tavern as

2098
02:19:57,045 --> 02:20:02,559
people have been drinking heavily into the evening
like a city that is still recovering from five

2099
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:05,843
years of perpetual torment does.

2100
02:20:05,843 --> 02:20:10,691
ASHLEY: But it's just like, she's so pretty with
like a feather in her hair.

2101
02:20:10,691 --> 02:20:16,574
TRAVIS: I know! She's like a bitch but in a
furious way.

2102
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:19,119
ASHLEY: I know! And she's really good with money!

2103
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,376
TRAVIS: I know-- And if she gives you the eyebrow
and then you're like--

2104
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:23,415
ASHLEY: I know. And then when she got the broom--

2105
02:20:23,415 --> 02:20:24,843
TRAVIS: (sobs) Yeah.

2106
02:20:24,843 --> 02:20:26,012
ASHLEY: With her hair--

2107
02:20:26,012 --> 02:20:27,995
TRAVIS: I know! And her fur and--

2108
02:20:27,995 --> 02:20:29,459
ASHLEY: She's the best.

2109
02:20:29,459 --> 02:20:31,612
TRAVIS: (blows nose)

2110
02:20:31,612 --> 02:20:34,183
ASHLEY: (blows nose)

2111
02:20:34,183 --> 02:20:36,326
TRAVIS: It's not fair, I tell you.

2112
02:20:36,326 --> 02:20:39,537
ASHLEY: I know. Ugh.

2113
02:20:39,537 --> 02:20:41,270
TRAVIS: Good shit.

2114
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:44,559
ASHLEY: (sighs) Do you know what I do every
night?

2115
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:45,799
TRAVIS: What?

2116
02:20:45,799 --> 02:20:50,864
ASHLEY: I sometimes-- I sometimes--

2117
02:20:50,864 --> 02:20:52,036
TRAVIS: Yep.

2118
02:20:52,036 --> 02:20:59,803
ASHLEY: -- put in my earring and I have
conversations with Scanlan. I know he can't hear.

2119
02:20:59,803 --> 02:21:01,947
TRAVIS: Well, who talks back?

2120
02:21:01,947 --> 02:21:03,010
ASHLEY: Nobody!

2121
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:05,026
TRAVIS: Aw! That's awful!

2122
02:21:05,026 --> 02:21:13,053
ASHLEY: I just tell him how the day was and what I
did and-- you know. I just say-- I don't--

2123
02:21:13,053 --> 02:21:15,175
obviously he's not going to talk back.

2124
02:21:15,175 --> 02:21:21,364
TRAVIS: (shaky breathing) I've never tried that
before.

2125
02:21:21,364 --> 02:21:26,799
ASHLEY: You should try it sometimes or just see,
you know. I know he can't hear.

2126
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:31,743
TRAVIS: Right. Sometimes I go into like, the house
of lady favors--

2127
02:21:31,743 --> 02:21:32,777
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2128
02:21:32,777 --> 02:21:37,622
TRAVIS: And I'm like, one for me and one for...
me! (sobs)

2129
02:21:37,622 --> 02:21:38,806
ASHLEY: (sobs)

2130
02:21:38,806 --> 02:21:42,718
(laughter)

2131
02:21:42,718 --> 02:21:48,121
ASHLEY: Well.

2132
02:21:48,121 --> 02:21:51,767
TRAVIS: How do you think Tary's doing?

2133
02:21:51,767 --> 02:21:53,915
ASHLEY: I don't know.

2134
02:21:53,915 --> 02:21:55,705
TRAVIS: I don't either.

2135
02:21:55,705 --> 02:22:01,376
ASHLEY: I don't know. I felt bad. Once we had the
story then I was like. Maybe-- The story of his

2136
02:22:01,376 --> 02:22:04,375
life. I was like, maybe he shouldn't go with her.

2137
02:22:04,375 --> 02:22:06,128
TRAVIS: Oh really?

2138
02:22:06,128 --> 02:22:11,036
ASHLEY: I don't know. Because he had-- Maybe we
should have found him somebody else.

2139
02:22:11,036 --> 02:22:13,032
TRAVIS: Like?

2140
02:22:13,032 --> 02:22:17,888
ASHLEY: I guess we didn't find them. She just came
along.

2141
02:22:17,888 --> 02:22:23,417
TRAVIS Yeah. I mean, the hunt was on. Yep. You
just got to kind of react at that point.

2142
02:22:23,417 --> 02:22:24,413
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2143
02:22:24,413 --> 02:22:26,773
TRAVIS: Let the river take you where it will.

2144
02:22:26,773 --> 02:22:44,085
ASHLEY: Well. I'm tired now. I said earlier I
wasn't tired, but I do get tired.

2145
02:22:44,085 --> 02:22:50,470
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do too. I mean, it's probably
because you've been crying so much.

2146
02:22:50,470 --> 02:22:54,687
ASHLEY: I think it just takes so much out of your
body to cry.

2147
02:22:54,854 --> 02:22:59,954
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the water's got to
come from somewhere, right?

2148
02:22:59,954 --> 02:23:03,094
ASHLEY: I know. It's like, where does it all come
from? There's so much of it.

2149
02:23:03,094 --> 02:23:04,233
TRAVIS: I don't know.

2150
02:23:04,233 --> 02:23:14,312
(laughter)

2151
02:23:14,312 --> 02:23:17,874
MATT: As Grog passes out at the table next to you,
you look up and at this point, notice that most of

2152
02:23:17,874 --> 02:23:22,581
the tavern is now empty and you have no idea what
hour it is but it seems pretty late and pretty

2153
02:23:22,581 --> 02:23:38,148
empty. You glance over and as the tavern is still
open, it doesn't really close per se, but the

2154
02:23:38,148 --> 02:23:42,243
night shift-- You see Shauna's finishing. She's
throwing a shawl over, she's getting ready to

2155
02:23:42,243 --> 02:23:48,507
leave. She looks over and sees you and takes off
her shawl and throws it around Grog.

2156
02:23:48,507 --> 02:23:49,744
ASHLEY: Thanks.

2157
02:23:49,744 --> 02:23:53,817
MATT: And goes, "Take care of him."

2158
02:23:53,817 --> 02:23:56,295
ASHLEY: I will. He's fine.

2159
02:23:56,295 --> 02:23:57,792
MATT: "He's dumb."

2160
02:23:57,792 --> 02:24:01,050
ASHLEY: He's not as dumb as he seems.

2161
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:04,887
MATT: "That's good. Because he seems pretty
dumb."

2162
02:24:04,887 --> 02:24:08,911
ASHLEY: I know it's just-- but his heart is so--
it's just as big as he is.

2163
02:24:08,911 --> 02:24:13,842
MATT: "I can tell by the company he keeps. You
guys wouldn't stick around if he wasn't."

2164
02:24:13,842 --> 02:24:17,897
TRAVIS: Cheese and flowers. (snores)

2165
02:24:17,897 --> 02:24:20,937
MATT: "But I expect you to leave that shawl back
here. It's going to be here in the morning."

2166
02:24:20,937 --> 02:24:25,112
ASHLEY: I will. It will be good as new, right here
on the table, folded for you.

2167
02:24:25,112 --> 02:24:33,830
MATT: "All right. Well, I guess find a stool and
curl up. I'm going to bed." And she leaves.

2168
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:37,929
ASHLEY: Night, Shauna. It was so nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for everything.

2169
02:24:37,929 --> 02:24:40,024
MATT: "You too. What's your name?"

2170
02:24:40,024 --> 02:24:41,338
ASHLEY: My name's Pike.

2171
02:24:41,338 --> 02:24:44,089
MATT: "Pike. Pleasure to meet you." And she
reaches out and takes your hand.

2172
02:24:44,089 --> 02:24:45,859
ASHLEY: It's very nice to meet you.

2173
02:24:45,859 --> 02:24:48,555
TRAVIS: (snorts) That's my pinwheel!

2174
02:24:48,555 --> 02:24:51,582
ASHLEY: He talks in his sleep. It'll be fine,
don't worry.

2175
02:24:51,582 --> 02:24:58,847
MATT: She leaves. Closes the door behind her. You
can choose to eventually pass out with Grog if you

2176
02:24:58,847 --> 02:25:00,525
want as well or--

2177
02:25:00,525 --> 02:25:01,365
ASHLEY: Well.

2178
02:25:01,365 --> 02:25:05,042
MATT: What do you want to do?

2179
02:25:05,042 --> 02:25:15,450
ASHLEY: Scanlan? I know you can't hear, but I'm
sitting in a tavern right now with Grog; he just

2180
02:25:15,450 --> 02:25:25,817
went to sleep. I had a pretty good day. I had to
do a lot of labor; just lifting stuff into a cart.

2181
02:25:25,817 --> 02:25:39,075
And then, you know, Vox Machina, lo and behold,
come home and I see them and now we're here. But

2182
02:25:39,075 --> 02:25:49,020
we miss you. I'm going to-- I'm very tired.

2183
02:25:49,085 --> 02:25:50,606
(snores)

2184
02:25:50,606 --> 02:25:53,744
(laughter)

2185
02:25:53,744 --> 02:25:55,560
MARISHA: The saddest thing.

2186
02:25:55,560 --> 02:26:01,885
MATT: Aw. And with that, the night comes to a
close. The next morning, the sun rises. Those who

2187
02:26:01,885 --> 02:26:08,710
are staying in the castle, you rise to the
familiar smell of early breakfast meats, eggs,

2188
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:17,103
other classic meals being prepared for the various
guard of the castle and those who belong to the

2189
02:26:17,103 --> 02:26:22,824
chamber of Whitestone as it currently stands. As
you all begin to convene down there, the two of

2190
02:26:22,824 --> 02:26:28,822
you come to consciousness as two giant glasses of
water are slammed on the table from a morning

2191
02:26:28,822 --> 02:26:34,300
Shauna arriving-- drags the shawl out from under
Grog's head which is now damp with just a

2192
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:39,222
multitude of drool that has just seeped into it.
She squeezes it out and

2193
02:26:39,222 --> 02:26:41,967
sets it on the side of the bar.

2194
02:26:41,967 --> 02:26:44,406
TRAVIS: Somebody left that there.

2195
02:26:44,406 --> 02:26:49,453
ASHLEY: I wasn't up yet to fix it.

2196
02:26:49,453 --> 02:26:51,492
MATT: "It's fine, it's fine."

2197
02:26:51,492 --> 02:26:52,812
TRAVIS: It's fine.

2198
02:26:52,812 --> 02:26:58,491
MATT: As she starts getting ready and a couple of
the other bar hands start setting up the tavern,

2199
02:26:58,491 --> 02:27:08,763
you hear footfalls come rushing down and you watch
as Trisha comes rushing down, putting on her armor

2200
02:27:08,763 --> 02:27:13,268
real fast. She's going, "Shit, shit. I'm late!
Shit, shit, shit." and just rushes out the door.

2201
02:27:13,268 --> 02:27:18,791
ASHLEY: Oh, she's still-- she stayed the whole
night.

2202
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:21,938
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you--

2203
02:27:21,938 --> 02:27:24,422
ASHLEY: That's a good-- That's a good sign,
right?

2204
02:27:24,422 --> 02:27:26,032
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2205
02:27:26,032 --> 02:27:27,336
ASHLEY: Sorry--

2206
02:27:27,336 --> 02:27:28,229
TRAVIS: Jerky?

2207
02:27:28,229 --> 02:27:29,443
ASHLEY: Chicken pot pie.

2208
02:27:29,443 --> 02:27:31,549
(laughter)

2209
02:27:31,549 --> 02:27:36,682
MATT: About five minutes more, you see the slow
footfalls of Taryon Derrington make his way down

2210
02:27:36,682 --> 02:27:44,568
the stairs into the empty tavern. Early morning,
it's maybe 8AM at this point. You can just hear

2211
02:27:44,568 --> 02:27:49,141
the birds going on the outside. The blearing sun's
beginning to crest over the mountains--

2212
02:27:49,141 --> 02:27:50,994
TRAVIS: We got alcohol sweats.

2213
02:27:50,994 --> 02:27:53,101
MATT: Yeah. Nah, you guys are pretty hung over at
this point.

2214
02:27:53,101 --> 02:27:58,017
ASHLEY: Just so thirsty.

2215
02:27:58,017 --> 02:28:02,677
SAM: Oh, you there. Hello. You're still here?

2216
02:28:02,677 --> 02:28:04,492
ASHLEY: We just waited just in case.

2217
02:28:04,492 --> 02:28:09,049
SAM: I have a headache. Oof. Rough night, huh?

2218
02:28:09,049 --> 02:28:13,368
ASHLEY: How do you-- it was rough? How do you
feel?

2219
02:28:13,368 --> 02:28:17,249
(laughter)

2220
02:28:17,249 --> 02:28:24,436
SAM: I-- I feel good. Different. Better.

2221
02:28:24,436 --> 02:28:26,600
ASHLEY: You feel different?

2222
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:40,466
SAM: I feel-- wow. That Trish is-- she's a lot of
woman. How'd you guys do?

2223
02:28:40,466 --> 02:28:43,310
TRAVIS: Oh, enough about us.

2224
02:28:43,310 --> 02:28:46,038
ASHLEY: Great meal, great company--

2225
02:28:46,038 --> 02:28:47,135
TRAVIS: Yep.

2226
02:28:47,135 --> 02:28:48,403
ASHLEY: Great night.

2227
02:28:48,403 --> 02:28:56,350
SAM: Yeah, it was something else. I mean, there's
periods that I don't really remember but she was

2228
02:28:56,350 --> 02:29:07,700
aggressive when she needed to be and gentle when
she needed to be and-- I've read a lot about--

2229
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:17,849
that-- and a lot of things I've read were true. I
mean, the female form is mysterious and strange

2230
02:29:17,849 --> 02:29:23,056
and-- there are curves and--

2231
02:29:23,056 --> 02:29:24,847
ASHLEY: So many curves.

2232
02:29:24,847 --> 02:29:26,463
SAM: Smells and--

2233
02:29:26,463 --> 02:29:29,926
TRAVIS: Tary, you didn't just give each other
massages all night, did you?

2234
02:29:29,926 --> 02:29:31,265
SAM: Oh, no.

2235
02:29:31,265 --> 02:29:32,869
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

2236
02:29:33,084 --> 02:29:42,530
ASHLEY: Details, details. (laughs) Do we need
mimosas?

2237
02:29:42,530 --> 02:29:54,608
SAM: I-- I have experienced-- the pleasures of the
flesh. I have now known a woman. It was

2238
02:29:54,608 --> 02:30:08,817
outrageous. I didn't really know what I was doing,
but she guided me, sometimes by force.

2239
02:30:08,817 --> 02:30:10,570
ASHLEY: Okay.

2240
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:24,800
SAM: But she was also gentle sometimes, and I get
it now. I see the appeal. I understand. Women are

2241
02:30:24,853 --> 02:30:30,901
soft and tender and (clears throat)

2242
02:30:30,901 --> 02:30:33,411
they are not for me.

2243
02:30:33,411 --> 02:30:37,386
(laughter)

2244
02:30:37,386 --> 02:30:45,650
SAM: I mean, there are so many holes, and you
don't know which one is the right one.

2245
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:51,292
ASHLEY: You know, it just depends on the day, I
guess.

2246
02:30:51,292 --> 02:30:58,049
TRAVIS: Yeah. It can be confusing. Especially in
the dark, right?

2247
02:30:58,049 --> 02:31:11,895
SAM: She was so strong, and I was so scared, and I
really think-- (vomiting noises).

2248
02:31:11,895 --> 02:31:14,619
(laughter)

2249
02:31:14,619 --> 02:31:16,193
TRAVIS: Oh. No.

2250
02:31:16,193 --> 02:31:23,258
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, Grog.

2251
02:31:23,258 --> 02:31:26,801
TRAVIS: That's a 16.

2252
02:31:26,801 --> 02:31:28,410
MATT: You're okay.

2253
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:42,552
ASHLEY: Okay, you know what? This is what
adventurers do, and you did it--

2254
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:46,983
SAM: No, I see that. I see how people would find
that--

2255
02:31:46,983 --> 02:31:52,236
TRAVIS: I feel like we need to commemorate this.
You're not the same man you were when we last saw

2256
02:31:52,236 --> 02:31:53,548
you last night.

2257
02:31:53,548 --> 02:31:56,677
ASHLEY: Look at that face. You've seen things.

2258
02:31:56,677 --> 02:32:08,775
SAM: They're so intricate and soft and I just feel
like I think I know what I like now, and that was

2259
02:32:08,775 --> 02:32:16,572
a worthy endeavor, and thank you, Pike for
encouraging it, and Grog for setting me up.

2260
02:32:16,572 --> 02:32:19,482
ASHLEY: Without a shadow of a doubt, now you
know.

2261
02:32:19,482 --> 02:32:29,979
SAM: I know for sure, 100%. I am not going to do
that ever again with anyone like her or anyone

2262
02:32:29,979 --> 02:32:31,855
similar.

2263
02:32:31,855 --> 02:32:37,127
TRAVIS: Should we go get tattoos or get you a new
haircut or something to commemorate this?

2264
02:32:37,127 --> 02:32:40,312
SAM: No, my body is a temple and I wouldn't sully
it like that.

2265
02:32:40,312 --> 02:32:41,506
TRAVIS: It's a temple?

2266
02:32:41,506 --> 02:32:45,609
(laughter)

2267
02:32:45,609 --> 02:32:47,515
TRAVIS: Well, all right.

2268
02:32:47,515 --> 02:32:50,923
ASHLEY: Let's get back. Did you get to sleep, at
all? Do you need sleep?

2269
02:32:50,923 --> 02:33:00,208
SAM: When she was finished with me, she let me
curl into a ball.

2270
02:33:00,208 --> 02:33:03,376
TRAVIS: (laughs) Did you cast Sanctuary?

2271
02:33:03,376 --> 02:33:05,960
(laughter)

2272
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:16,246
SAM: There was a valley between her pecs-- her
breasts, I guess? And there was a nice little

2273
02:33:16,413 --> 02:33:22,671
resting place right there that I laid my head for
the night, and she draped her arms over me and

2274
02:33:22,671 --> 02:33:31,450
they were like big sweaty blankets. And I needed
to get up to pee in the middle of the night, but I

2275
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:34,910
couldn't, so I just held it.

2276
02:33:34,910 --> 02:33:37,549
LIAM: Mercy!

2277
02:33:37,549 --> 02:33:47,813
SAM: It was like being attacked by a bear. Have
you seen The Departed?

2278
02:33:47,813 --> 02:33:54,004
(laughter)

2279
02:33:54,004 --> 02:33:55,535
SAM: Let's go get cleaned up.

2280
02:33:55,535 --> 02:33:57,389
TALIESIN: And it's over.

2281
02:33:57,389 --> 02:34:03,714
LIAM: Not the chapter of the story we were
expecting.

2282
02:34:03,714 --> 02:34:06,357
(laughter)

2283
02:34:06,357 --> 02:34:21,496
MATT: Is it ever? I've actually been privy to this
exact conversation with a few guys who found out the

2284
02:34:21,561 --> 02:34:28,746
same way in high school. "Nope! Not for me." Oh my
god. That's amazing.

2285
02:34:28,746 --> 02:34:31,569
LIAM: My face feels like it's on fire.

2286
02:34:31,569 --> 02:34:33,287
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel really pink.

2287
02:34:33,287 --> 02:34:39,376
MATT: As you guys are eating breakfast and
Cassandra makes her way down, joins you all and

2288
02:34:39,376 --> 02:34:46,281
begins the meal, her personal bodyguard is looking
exhausted and frustrated and tapping the toe.

2289
02:34:46,281 --> 02:34:55,084
Eventually you watch as a new guard comes in and,
"I'm so sorry." And they switch out, and the new

2290
02:34:55,084 --> 02:35:02,481
personal bodyguard of Cassandra is Trisha, who
stops and sets up and apologizes to Cassandra,

2291
02:35:02,481 --> 02:35:06,370
then turns and gets into guard duty and sees the
rest of you eating breakfast and goes--

2292
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:10,901
TRAVIS: Yo.

2293
02:35:10,901 --> 02:35:12,572
MATT: "Good morning."

2294
02:35:12,572 --> 02:35:13,893
MARISHA: Good morning!

2295
02:35:13,893 --> 02:35:17,682
MATT: As you guys now approach and walk in. About
20 minutes later, after this whole conversation,

2296
02:35:17,682 --> 02:35:23,141
you guys have cleaned up and made your way, she
says nothing else and is now like, "oh boy."

2297
02:35:23,141 --> 02:35:25,095
ASHLEY: Oh, you were just--

2298
02:35:25,095 --> 02:35:29,940
MARISHA: Oh! That's why you're being so quiet.
Oh.

2299
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:37,881
MATT: After you guys have had a meal and you guys
have made your way and had this bit of

2300
02:35:37,881 --> 02:35:45,109
interaction, where she's like, (shushes).
Cassandra comes over and sits facing you,

2301
02:35:45,109 --> 02:35:47,042
Vex'ahlia.

2302
02:35:47,042 --> 02:35:49,216
MARISHA: Cassandra. (shushes)

2303
02:35:49,216 --> 02:36:01,042
MATT: "All right. Lady Vex'ahlia, me and Percival
had a conversation last night and it's come to my

2304
02:36:01,042 --> 02:36:09,121
"attention that you've been granted a title here
within Whitestone."

2305
02:36:09,121 --> 02:36:10,791
LAURA: Yes.

2306
02:36:10,791 --> 02:36:23,881
MATT: "A title that has been unfulfilled for quite
some time, and I, for one, being the figurehead of

2307
02:36:23,881 --> 02:36:32,301
"the city, I wish to welcome you as a member of our
chamber, as the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

2308
02:36:32,301 --> 02:36:36,094
"Do you understand the responsibilities?"

2309
02:36:36,094 --> 02:36:40,807
LAURA: I have no idea of the responsibilities. In
fact, I have no idea what being a lady really

2310
02:36:40,807 --> 02:36:44,273
means, except for saying I'm a lady every once in
a while.

2311
02:36:44,273 --> 02:36:46,116
MATT: "To be perfectly honest, it means very
little."

2312
02:36:46,116 --> 02:36:46,939
LAURA: Oh!

2313
02:36:46,939 --> 02:36:49,275
MATT: "I can say that from experience. It means
people look at you and expect you to have the

2314
02:36:49,275 --> 02:36:50,699
"answer, and you--"

2315
02:36:50,699 --> 02:36:52,576
LAURA: Have all the answers.

2316
02:36:52,576 --> 02:36:58,758
MATT: She leans in and goes, "And you're really
just making it up best you can, but you do your

2317
02:36:58,758 --> 02:37:09,778
"best. But as the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt,
upon the completion of the Grey Hunt, you are

2318
02:37:09,778 --> 02:37:17,006
"responsible for overseeing local diplomacy and
rooting out mundane and supernatural dangers

2319
02:37:17,006 --> 02:37:19,737
"throughout the surrounding Parchwood."

2320
02:37:19,737 --> 02:37:21,164
LAURA: All right.

2321
02:37:21,164 --> 02:37:22,984
MATT: "To protect the citizens of Whitestone."

2322
02:37:22,984 --> 02:37:25,378
LAURA: So I'm like a guard?

2323
02:37:25,378 --> 02:37:31,412
TALIESIN: Oh no. More of a-- what would be the
word I would think to use?

2324
02:37:31,412 --> 02:37:33,020
MARISHA: Vanquisher.

2325
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:37,032
LAURA: Destroyer of Worlds?

2326
02:37:37,032 --> 02:37:40,749
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah. Decimator of Beasts.

2327
02:37:40,749 --> 02:37:53,013
MATT: "You will be eventually training and be
granted a cadre of people beneath you as part of

2328
02:37:53,013 --> 02:37:58,874
"the Grey Hunt, who you will train and oversee as
they ensure that the surrounding Parchwood is safe

2329
02:37:58,874 --> 02:38:05,596
"in the local area around Whitestone. As you may or
may not know, there is a very long history of

2330
02:38:05,596 --> 02:38:19,203
"dangers within the forest. This entire valley was
the result of a cataclysmic conflict during the

2331

"Calamity, specifically between the Dawnfather,
Pelor, and a very dark entity. As such, there are

2332
02:38:30,335 --> 02:38:39,527
"still scars of the land that give birth to a
multitude of creatures that we need someone to

2333
02:38:39,527 --> 02:38:44,387
"ensure do not wander far and begin to destroy
and threaten our people."

2334
02:38:44,505 --> 02:38:51,141
LAURA: What kind of creatures are we talking?
Beholder creatures, or big wolf-type creatures?

2335
02:38:51,141 --> 02:38:54,372
TALIESIN: Odds and ends. It's less of a guard and
more of a champion.

2336
02:38:54,372 --> 02:38:55,683
MATT: "Yes."

2337
02:38:55,683 --> 02:38:57,089
LAURA: All right.

2338
02:38:57,089 --> 02:39:04,738
MATT: "Your lesser guard keeps watch through
patrols, and when something arises, you find it,

2339
02:39:04,738 --> 02:39:09,303
"learn about it, and if it's necessary, destroy
it."

2340
02:39:09,303 --> 02:39:17,829
LAURA: Yeah! That's no problem. I'm really tough
and strong and stuff, so yeah, that sounds fine.

2341
02:39:17,829 --> 02:39:19,283
LIAM: You can do that.

2342
02:39:19,283 --> 02:39:21,699
MATT: "Your skillset actually fits quite well for
this, which I understand is why Percival

2343
02:39:21,699 --> 02:39:24,099
"bequeathed this upon you."

2344
02:39:24,099 --> 02:39:26,574
TALIESIN: You'll be stronger than the last one, I
will say.

2345
02:39:26,574 --> 02:39:28,182
LAURA: When was the last one?

2346
02:39:28,182 --> 02:39:29,783
MATT: "That would be--"

2347
02:39:29,783 --> 02:39:32,558
TALIESIN: That would have been right before the
unpleasantness.

2348
02:39:32,558 --> 02:39:37,817
MATT: "Yes. About three years before the
Briarwoods' arrival. I, at the time, was much

2349
02:39:37,817 --> 02:39:45,497
"younger and didn't know much, but Regae, the
individual who currently held the position, was

2350
02:39:45,497 --> 02:39:53,311
"not as respected as I think you will easily
become."

2351
02:39:53,311 --> 02:39:56,582
TALIESIN: He was under the Anders house, which is
why the Anders house is now forfeit.

2352
02:39:56,582 --> 02:39:57,778
LAURA: Oh.

2353
02:39:57,778 --> 02:40:04,489
MATT: "I'm so excited! However-- and while I'm
still learning this as I go through our family's

2354
02:40:04,489 --> 02:40:13,461
"history and the structure of governance here in
Whitestone, there is-- How do I-- A ritual?"

2355
02:40:13,461 --> 02:40:15,114
TALIESIN: That would be--

2356
02:40:15,114 --> 02:40:18,214
MATT: "A ceremony that you must undertake."

2357
02:40:18,214 --> 02:40:19,079
LAURA: Oh.

2358
02:40:19,079 --> 02:40:19,987
MATT: "Just you."

2359
02:40:19,987 --> 02:40:20,817
LAURA: Just me?

2360
02:40:20,817 --> 02:40:21,972
MATT AND TALIESIN: Just you.

2361
02:40:21,972 --> 02:40:23,212
LAURA: What about Trinket?

2362
02:40:23,212 --> 02:40:28,777
MATT: "Trinket, I imagine, as your companion,
could be a part of it. However, as the one to be

2363
02:40:28,842 --> 02:40:32,184
"titled, this journey is just for you."

2364
02:40:32,184 --> 02:40:35,006
TALIESIN: Just for you.

2365
02:40:35,006 --> 02:40:39,794
LAURA: Even Keyleth got friends. No?

2366
02:40:39,794 --> 02:40:41,514
SAM: Can we watch?

2367
02:40:41,514 --> 02:40:42,906
MARISHA: Yay, Vex!

2368
02:40:42,906 --> 02:40:44,491
LAURA: Vex.

2369
02:40:44,491 --> 02:40:54,413
MATT: "The nature of this is a hunt. And I do not
believe that your skillsets would aid her in the

2370
02:40:54,413 --> 02:41:04,977
"speed and tracking that is required for this
particular endeavor."

2371
02:41:04,977 --> 02:41:06,839
LIAM: I think you will be fine.

2372
02:41:06,839 --> 02:41:14,101
LAURA: Obviously! I mean, I'm going to kick
serious butt, but what if I don't? What happens

2373
02:41:14,101 --> 02:41:17,385
then? Do I lose my title? Do I just suck forever?
What?

2374
02:41:17,385 --> 02:41:26,602
MATT: "If you do not succeed, then you will have
to wait until the Dawnfather presents the next

2375
02:41:26,602 --> 02:41:28,432
"opportunity for the Hunt."

2376
02:41:28,432 --> 02:41:29,310
LAURA: Right.

2377
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:30,339
MATT: "I don't know--"

2378
02:41:30,339 --> 02:41:31,247
LAURA: When that could--

2379
02:41:31,247 --> 02:41:32,322
MATT: "-- when that would be."

2380
02:41:32,322 --> 02:41:35,206
LAURA: So wait, has the opportunity presented
itself now?

2381
02:41:35,206 --> 02:41:41,079
MATT: "Well, it's as soon as you wish to go and
find your way to the Sun Tree and meditate for the

2382
02:41:41,079 --> 02:41:47,117
"sign. I don't know the specifics of this. This is
just from what the--" And she starts pulling over

2383
02:41:47,117 --> 02:41:51,097
this cluster of books she had on the side and she
starts rummaging through, and she pulls it over

2384
02:41:51,097 --> 02:42:02,365
and goes: "It's unfortunately very vague. And
it's, apparently-- Keeper Yennen might know

2385
02:42:02,365 --> 02:42:03,425
"more."

2386
02:42:03,425 --> 02:42:04,552
LAURA: Okay.

2387
02:42:04,552 --> 02:42:12,716
MATT: "He's the resident priest of Pelor and this
is a ritual of his, but yes."

2388
02:42:12,716 --> 02:42:17,838
LAURA: Wonderful. Well, I'm not intimidated by
this at all.

2389
02:42:17,838 --> 02:42:20,184
MARISHA: You'll like the Sun Tree, he's very
nice.

2390
02:42:20,184 --> 02:42:21,324
LAURA: Great.

2391
02:42:21,324 --> 02:42:22,441
MARISHA: Yeah.

2392
02:42:22,441 --> 02:42:24,028
LAURA: Great.

2393
02:42:24,028 --> 02:42:25,958
TRAVIS: Yeah man, come on.

2394
02:42:25,958 --> 02:42:27,244
LIAM: Yeah, this is great.

2395
02:42:27,244 --> 02:42:28,980
TRAVIS: It's right up your alley. Tracking,
hunting.

2396
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:30,899
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. By myself. No big deal. No
big deal.

2397
02:42:30,899 --> 02:42:32,124
LIAM: The things you have done--

2398
02:42:32,124 --> 02:42:33,192
LAURA: This is nothing.

2399
02:42:33,192 --> 02:42:34,023
LIAM: Exactly.

2400
02:42:34,023 --> 02:42:34,864
LAURA: Right?

2401
02:42:34,864 --> 02:42:35,816
TALIESIN: Right.

2402
02:42:35,816 --> 02:42:37,522
LAURA: You're not going to send me out there to
die, Percy.

2403
02:42:37,522 --> 02:42:38,909
TALIESIN: Hopefully not.

2404
02:42:38,909 --> 02:42:40,179
ASHLEY: Is that a possibility?

2405
02:42:40,179 --> 02:42:41,519
SAM: You got this.

2406
02:42:41,519 --> 02:42:47,472
LAURA: Thanks, Tary. Look at you, you're so strong
and knowledgeable now.

2407
02:42:47,472 --> 02:42:48,732
SAM: Don't look at me.

2408
02:42:48,732 --> 02:42:51,185
(laughter)

2409
02:42:51,185 --> 02:42:59,319
TALIESIN: We'll go down, learn a little bit more
and begin when you're ready.

2410
02:42:59,319 --> 02:43:06,668
LAURA: All right. Sure, yeah. Great. Well, I shove
a bunch of eggs in my mouth and I get up and I'm

2411
02:43:06,668 --> 02:43:09,042
going to find Keeper Yennen then.

2412
02:43:09,042 --> 02:43:10,434
TALIESIN: I follow.

2413
02:43:10,434 --> 02:43:19,447
MATT: All right. Easy enough. You find the
central-- The same open, almost-- What's the term

2414
02:43:19,447 --> 02:43:26,801
I'm looking for? It's the half-domed speaking,
presentational--

2415
02:43:26,801 --> 02:43:28,205
MARISHA: Like an amphitheatre?

2416
02:43:28,205 --> 02:43:30,683
MATT: Amphitheatre! Thank you, yes, that's the
word I was looking for.

2417
02:43:30,683 --> 02:43:31,707
MARISHA: Words.

2418
02:43:31,707 --> 02:43:35,709
MATT: The amphitheatre set up, which Keeper Yennen
usually keeps for all his various sermons. It's

2419
02:43:35,709 --> 02:43:42,547
early enough where nobody has gathered. It is not
any of the chosen weekly holy days of Pelor, so as

2420
02:43:42,603 --> 02:43:47,883
you arrive, he looks like he's in the process of
going through and sweeping and doing his morning

2421
02:43:47,883 --> 02:43:55,403
ritual of upkeep. And you walk up and you can see
his beard has grown a bit longer now and his grey

2422
02:43:55,403 --> 02:44:00,045
has spread a bit since last time you had a true
conversation. It's been a very tense situation.

2423
02:44:00,045 --> 02:44:07,224
You can see occasionally the accelerated age that
recent events has imparted upon individuals of the

2424
02:44:07,224 --> 02:44:12,094
city. But as he sweeps and notices you arrive,
"Oh, yes!"

2425
02:44:12,094 --> 02:44:13,405
LAURA: Hi.

2426
02:44:13,405 --> 02:44:15,005
MATT: "Uh."

2427
02:44:15,005 --> 02:44:16,007
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

2428
02:44:16,007 --> 02:44:17,508
MATT: "Vex'ahlia, thank you."

2429
02:44:17,508 --> 02:44:22,825
LAURA: Lady Vex'ahlia, Grand Mistress of the Grey
Hunt, apparently, which I'm here to talk to you

2430
02:44:22,825 --> 02:44:23,679
about.

2431
02:44:23,679 --> 02:44:30,450
MATT: "Oh! Excuse me." And he wanders off and he
puts the broom back in this little closet and

2432
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:40,408
clutter falls out. "Oh, god-- Just a--". Puts
things back up. Closes the closet. Hobbles back in

2433
02:44:40,408 --> 02:44:46,386
your direction. "You are-- You are the Grand
Mistress of the Grey Hunt?"

2434
02:44:46,386 --> 02:44:48,077
LAURA: Apparently.

2435
02:44:48,077 --> 02:44:51,127
TALIESIN: She needs to be appropriately
consecrated, obviously.

2436
02:44:51,127 --> 02:44:53,759
LAURA: Oh? I thought that happened last night,
dear.

2437
02:44:53,759 --> 02:44:55,001
TALIESIN: Shush now.

2438
02:44:55,001 --> 02:45:08,856
MATT: He looks lost. "Anyway. It's been some time.
Well." And he starts looking around and pulling up

2439
02:45:08,856 --> 02:45:14,931
small scrolls and reading through. He goes and
rummages through and finds one. "Yes, yes, here it

2440
02:45:14,931 --> 02:45:29,232
"is. So for the Grand Purveyor of the Grey Hunt,
Mistress in this case, is to go into a state of

2441
02:45:29,232 --> 02:45:36,208
"deep meditation at the base of the Sun Tree and
ask for a vision from the great Dawnfather

2442
02:45:36,208 --> 02:45:46,487
"himself. There will be imparted upon her, at the
moment of the Grey Hunt, her quarry. You are then

2443
02:45:46,554 --> 02:45:51,777
"to find the quarry, wherever it may be within the
Parchwood."

2444
02:45:51,777 --> 02:45:53,594
LAURA: Okay.

2445
02:45:53,594 --> 02:45:56,720
MATT: "And decide the fate of said quarry."

2446
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:59,429
LAURA: Okay.

2447
02:45:59,429 --> 02:46:01,410
MATT: "That's all I have."

2448
02:46:01,410 --> 02:46:02,631
LAURA: That's it, huh?

2449
02:46:02,631 --> 02:46:03,509
SAM: Super explicit.

2450
02:46:03,509 --> 02:46:05,361
LAURA: Yeah, this explains so much.

2451
02:46:05,361 --> 02:46:06,569
SAM: Yep, yep.

2452
02:46:06,569 --> 02:46:07,821
LAURA: It's very clear.

2453
02:46:07,821 --> 02:46:10,289
SAM: Find the thing, decide to do with the thing
what you want to do.

2454
02:46:10,289 --> 02:46:19,751
MATT: "We've had previous individuals come from
the Grey Hunt bearing trophies of their hunt.

2455
02:46:19,751 --> 02:46:26,451
"Bearing various recovered examples of what they
felled."

2456
02:46:26,451 --> 02:46:30,848
LAURA: So I'm supposed to bring back some sort of
trophy, then? That would be good?

2457
02:46:30,912 --> 02:46:32,464
MATT: "A sign of your victory, yes."

2458
02:46:32,464 --> 02:46:33,764
LAURA: Right. Right.

2459
02:46:33,764 --> 02:46:35,277
TALIESIN: A sign of your victory.

2460
02:46:35,277 --> 02:46:36,370
LAURA: Right.

2461
02:46:36,370 --> 02:46:40,327
TALIESIN: Whatever that victory may be. I've read
a bit. I know a bit about what's to come.

2462
02:46:40,327 --> 02:46:45,347
LAURA: All right. Well, thank you, Keeper.

2463
02:46:45,347 --> 02:46:52,251
MATT: "Of course. If I may be of aid of any kind,
let me know. Though I don't know how much aid I

2464
02:46:52,251 --> 02:46:55,598
"can be in this endeavor. But let me know."

2465
02:46:55,598 --> 02:46:57,816
LAURA: Thank you.

2466
02:46:57,816 --> 02:47:06,684
MATT: "Good luck." And as you walk, he says,
"Dawnfather smile upon you!"

2467
02:47:06,684 --> 02:47:10,557
LAURA: And you! And you. The Dawnfather's Pelor,
right?

2468
02:47:10,557 --> 02:47:12,374
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll do fine.

2469
02:47:12,374 --> 02:47:13,364
LAURA: Great.

2470
02:47:13,364 --> 02:47:14,464
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2471
02:47:14,464 --> 02:47:16,164
LIAM: Heathen.

2472
02:47:16,164 --> 02:47:18,712
TRAVIS: So what'd he say?

2473
02:47:18,776 --> 02:47:25,092
LAURA: So I'm going to go and sit in front of a
tree. I'm going to think real hard. I'm going to

2474
02:47:25,092 --> 02:47:29,048
talk to a god and then I'm going to go kill
something.

2475
02:47:29,048 --> 02:47:30,196
TALIESIN: Maybe.

2476
02:47:30,196 --> 02:47:31,241
TRAVIS: She's so cool.

2477
02:47:31,241 --> 02:47:32,408
ASHLEY: She's the coolest.

2478
02:47:32,408 --> 02:47:33,525
LAURA: Potentially.

2479
02:47:33,525 --> 02:47:34,488
TRAVIS: Right?

2480
02:47:34,488 --> 02:47:35,386
MARISHA: Yeah.

2481
02:47:35,386 --> 02:47:36,400
SAM: Super cool.

2482
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:38,336
LAURA: Looking good, Tary, looking good.

2483
02:47:38,336 --> 02:47:41,859
LIAM: If you feed it though, she becomes
unbearable. Just temper that a little bit.

2484
02:47:41,859 --> 02:47:43,784
ASHLEY: It's okay. I don't mind feeding it.

2485
02:47:43,784 --> 02:47:47,407
TRAVIS: When are you going to do this amazing
think-real-hard?

2486
02:47:47,407 --> 02:47:49,234
LAURA: Well, fuck it.

2487
02:47:49,234 --> 02:47:50,395
ASHLEY: Now.

2488
02:47:50,395 --> 02:47:59,821
MARISHA: I buried a secret clubhouse under
Whitestone, at the roots of the Sun Tree. And

2489
02:47:59,821 --> 02:48:03,147
sometimes I go there and I talk to him.

2490
02:48:03,147 --> 02:48:05,290
LAURA: I remember you doing that.

2491
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:07,904
MARISHA: I realise this sounds very uncool when I
say it out loud.

2492
02:48:07,904 --> 02:48:09,440
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty uncool.

2493
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:11,414
TALIESIN: You're supposed to build the treehouse
in the top of the tree.

2494
02:48:11,414 --> 02:48:13,993
MARISHA: You're so cool, but I totally didn't put
the treehouse in the top of the tree. I totally

2495
02:48:13,993 --> 02:48:16,549
put it underneath the city. But there's a
treehouse. There's a clubhouse.

2496
02:48:16,549 --> 02:48:18,765
LAURA: I like this! Technically, I'm supposed to
be at the base of the tree, right?

2497
02:48:18,765 --> 02:48:24,645
MARISHA: You can go there and be alone, and it's
so quiet and peaceful and dark.

2498
02:48:24,645 --> 02:48:29,346
LAURA: What if Pelor can't see underground? What
if he needs to see me in the sun?

2499
02:48:29,346 --> 02:48:32,115
LIAM: What if one of the gods cannot see you
underground?

2500
02:48:32,115 --> 02:48:33,365
LAURA: I don't know how gods work.

2501
02:48:33,365 --> 02:48:35,698
LIAM: I think he can see you underground.

2502
02:48:35,698 --> 02:48:36,987
LAURA: I don't know.

2503
02:48:36,987 --> 02:48:38,382
LIAM: Yep. Nope.

2504
02:48:38,382 --> 02:48:44,183
MARISHA: Although sometimes I do climb into the
tree and I hug onto one of the branches--

2505
02:48:44,183 --> 02:48:46,320
LAURA: Solid. I'm just going to walk towards the
tree.

2506
02:48:46,493 --> 02:48:48,083
(laughter)

2507
02:48:48,083 --> 02:48:52,086
TALIESIN: I'm just going to follow in before we
send you off into this.

2508
02:48:52,086 --> 02:48:58,137
MATT: All right. You walk up and, I mean, the
city's starting to slowly spring to life as the

2509
02:48:58,137 --> 02:49:04,538
morning hours climb forward. People are arriving
and putting the last touches on the caravan. The

2510
02:49:04,538 --> 02:49:08,305
Pale Guard is finished and they've assigned the
division between those who are going to stay and

2511
02:49:08,305 --> 02:49:13,890
those who are to escort the caravan to Emon. Pike,
are you with the rest of the party?

2512
02:49:13,890 --> 02:49:16,486
ASHLEY: Yeah, I need to see what's going on.

2513
02:49:16,486 --> 02:49:21,742
MATT: As you're walking, one of the Pale Guards
sees you and walks up and goes, "Lady Pike? Are

2514
02:49:21,742 --> 02:49:25,110
"you to join us on the caravan?"

2515
02:49:25,110 --> 02:49:27,095
ASHLEY: That was today?

2516
02:49:27,095 --> 02:49:28,792
(laughter)

2517
02:49:28,792 --> 02:49:35,489
MATT: "We're leaving. It's-- I mean, I just don't
know."

2518
02:49:35,489 --> 02:49:46,634
ASHLEY: What-- Oh! What exactly were we doing? I'm
sorry, I've had a night.

2519
02:49:46,634 --> 02:49:53,450
MATT: "You escorted the caravan from Emon to
Whitestone and now we're returning to Emon from

2520
02:49:53,450 --> 02:49:58,120
"Whitestone with the caravan. I just wanted to know
if you wished to come or stay. We're leaving right

2521
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:58,995
"now."

2522
02:49:58,995 --> 02:50:00,439
ASHLEY: Oh. No.

2523
02:50:00,439 --> 02:50:01,557
TRAVIS: No!

2524
02:50:01,557 --> 02:50:02,665
ASHLEY: I'm-- No.

2525
02:50:02,665 --> 02:50:03,947
TRAVIS: No!

2526
02:50:03,947 --> 02:50:05,599
MATT: "All right. Great. No, that's all right."

2527
02:50:05,599 --> 02:50:08,011
ASHLEY: I'm saying, I've just been waiting for
them anyway. I'm going to stay.

2528
02:50:08,011 --> 02:50:09,229
LAURA: She's going to stay.

2529
02:50:09,229 --> 02:50:15,824
MATT: Behind this tiny, plated, gnomish form
there's this gargantuan goliath with rage in his

2530
02:50:15,824 --> 02:50:23,344
eyes. And he goes "All right! No, that's fine.
We're-- We're going to go." And he just turns and

2531
02:50:23,344 --> 02:50:25,199
leaves and runs towards the caravan.

2532
02:50:25,199 --> 02:50:26,528
ASHLEY: Bye! Be safe.

2533
02:50:26,528 --> 02:50:29,327
(laughter)

2534
02:50:29,327 --> 02:50:32,752
MARISHA: I need to learn from Pike and Grog how to
say no.

2535
02:50:32,752 --> 02:50:34,542
(laughter)

2536
02:50:34,542 --> 02:50:38,474
MATT: So, Lady Vex'ahlia, you've found yourself at
the base of the Sun Tree.

2537
02:50:38,474 --> 02:50:39,557
LAURA: Yes.

2538
02:50:39,557 --> 02:50:43,671
MATT: As you look up at it, the morning sun-- At
this point, the clouds that gathered yesterday

2539
02:50:43,671 --> 02:50:47,961
have all subsided and you have this beautiful
clear blue sky ahead of you. The morning sun's

2540
02:50:47,961 --> 02:50:53,101
coming down. The tree is beautiful as you're
watching it slowly blossom now as the months have

2541
02:50:53,101 --> 02:51:00,537
passed. You start seeing green in the boughs. The
occasional pod that might eventually flower as the

2542
02:51:00,537 --> 02:51:08,452
season allows it. But it's serene. And as
occasionally a breeze blows through, you hear the

2543
02:51:08,452 --> 02:51:15,176
various branches hit and some of the leaves shake.
It's a beautiful sight. What do you want to do?

2544
02:51:15,176 --> 02:51:18,312
LAURA: Did you want to say something, Percy?

2545
02:51:18,312 --> 02:51:25,156
TALIESIN: I just wanted to let you know that when
I sort of sprung this title on you, I chose the

2546
02:51:25,156 --> 02:51:31,184
Grey Hunt specifically. The Third House is easy,
it's just land and title. It doesn't mean

2547
02:51:31,184 --> 02:51:40,963
anything. As a child, the Grey Hunt was
fascinating because it was a title that one

2548
02:51:40,963 --> 02:51:52,050
earned. And I felt that you should have something
like this that no one could do otherwise other

2549
02:51:52,050 --> 02:51:58,605
than claim that you earned it. This is not
something that can be given and you're going to be

2550
02:51:58,605 --> 02:52:02,077
fine. I have complete faith.

2551
02:52:02,077 --> 02:52:06,847
LAURA: I give him a big hug and a kiss. I love
you, dear.

2552
02:52:06,847 --> 02:52:09,343
TALIESIN: I love you, too. Good luck.

2553
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:14,777
LAURA: Thank you. All right, get the fuck away
from me. I've got to meditate.

2554
02:52:14,777 --> 02:52:16,609
TALIESIN: Backing off.

2555
02:52:16,609 --> 02:52:21,787
MATT: As you all separate and scatter off into
your own business for the day in Whitestone.

2556
02:52:21,844 --> 02:52:26,886
Vex'ahlia, you find a comfortable place at the
base of the tree. You sit, cross your legs, look

2557
02:52:26,886 --> 02:52:31,050
up, and close your eyes and concentrate.

2558
02:52:31,050 --> 02:52:35,072
LAURA: I feel itchy, but I'm okay. I'm going to
stay still.

2559
02:52:35,072 --> 02:52:46,226
MATT: What thoughts are on your mind? What do you
wish to do? What is your approach to this

2560
02:52:46,226 --> 02:52:48,412
meditation?

2561
02:52:48,412 --> 02:52:56,717
LAURA: Okay. He said I'm supposed to meditate on
the tree? Or on Pelor? I'm going to try thinking

2562
02:52:56,717 --> 02:53:05,141
about the tree first. A lot. I'm thinking about
the leaves swaying and I think about finding a

2563
02:53:05,141 --> 02:53:12,050
quarry and, you know, hunting things. Then I'm
going to start thinking about what it feels like

2564
02:53:12,050 --> 02:53:19,273
to walk through the woods barefoot and hear the
leaves crunching underneath my feet and hear twigs

2565
02:53:19,273 --> 02:53:25,290
breaking as I hunt creatures and track them.

2566
02:53:25,290 --> 02:53:33,083
MATT: Okay. As you focus on this and you can hear
the breeze. You extend what best can be described

2567
02:53:33,083 --> 02:53:38,965
as your current consciousness or imagination to
the breadth of the Parchwood that consumes the

2568
02:53:38,965 --> 02:53:47,882
valleys of the Alabaster Sierras surrounding
Whitestone. You focus. And you remember the

2569
02:53:47,882 --> 02:53:52,352
journeys you had in the trees when you first
arrived. The wandering hunt, the phantom

2570
02:53:52,352 --> 02:53:58,075
individual wandering the trees in the distance
that you didn't quite mark. And you're curious

2571
02:53:58,075 --> 02:54:01,389
about that moment and you start thinking about the
people that have lived here their whole life and

2572
02:54:01,389 --> 02:54:09,045
think of the toil. And then your eyes open and the
sun, which was just beginning to come over the

2573
02:54:09,045 --> 02:54:14,446
hills into the sky, is now far past the horizon.
You're unsure how much time has passed, but you've

2574
02:54:14,446 --> 02:54:20,860
had no vision. You've had no words, no sign, and
you're now starting to hit into the afternoon.

2575
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:24,756
You've probably been here for a number of hours at
this point. And you're starting to feel the sweat

2576
02:54:24,756 --> 02:54:34,350
drip beneath the armor. Discomfort's settling in a
little bit. And you're beginning to feel that

2577
02:54:34,350 --> 02:54:42,728
conscious difficulty with separating what your
mind is trying to do and what your body is telling

2578
02:54:42,728 --> 02:54:45,465
you it's not enjoying.

2579
02:54:45,465 --> 02:54:58,218
LAURA: Okay. I should've learned Speak With Plants
from Keyleth. I'm going to sink down and I'm going

2580
02:54:58,218 --> 02:55:03,573
to take my armor off and try to feel the bark
beneath my back.

2581
02:55:03,573 --> 02:55:08,472
MATT: Okay. So you turn around, armor off, just
wearing your undertunic, and you press your back

2582
02:55:08,472 --> 02:55:14,357
against the actual tree itself, leaning your head
against it, and you close your eyes again and

2583
02:55:14,357 --> 02:55:18,697
begin to concentrate. At this point in the day,
the sun has crested over, so the shadow is still

2584
02:55:18,697 --> 02:55:25,532
hitting you from the side of the tree. So you're
not as warm as you were before. You focus, and you

2585
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:32,381
concentrate again on the expanse of this
landscape, the strange difference between the warm

2586
02:55:32,381 --> 02:55:37,892
midday, the cold mornings and evenings, and the
freezing nights that bring mists and low clouds

2587
02:55:37,892 --> 02:55:44,029
that shroud Whitestone in this somewhat
middle-to-northern area of Tal'Dorei itself into

2588
02:55:44,029 --> 02:55:58,470
the mystic, dark mythology that has encapsulated
it since it was first founded. After a while of

2589
02:55:58,470 --> 02:56:03,545
concentrating and letting your mind wander, your
eyes open again, and now you're hitting sunset.

2590
02:56:03,545 --> 02:56:08,418
It's growing colder, the breeze has picked up a
bit, and you see some clouds making their way

2591
02:56:08,418 --> 02:56:15,338
slowly from the wind of the southwest, cresting
over the mountains on the western side, the

2592
02:56:15,338 --> 02:56:20,309
Alabaster Sierras. No vision, no words. You can
start seeing now people are walking the street,

2593
02:56:20,309 --> 02:56:27,571
watching you strangely as they pass. You hear
horse hooves hitting as they pass by with carts

2594
02:56:27,571 --> 02:56:31,570
and people stop and stare and awkwardly whisper to
each other and keep walking.

2595
02:56:31,570 --> 02:56:39,549
LAURA: This sucks. Is anybody around that I know?

2596
02:56:39,549 --> 02:56:41,543
MATT: Currently, no.

2597
02:56:41,543 --> 02:57:01,165
LAURA: Good. I feel really stupid right now. Fuck!
I'm going to try going underneath the tree where

2598
02:57:01,165 --> 02:57:02,957
Keyleth said.

2599
02:57:02,957 --> 02:57:04,493
Where the little treehouse was.

2600
02:57:04,493 --> 02:57:07,576
MATT: Okay, you find your way to the small tunnel
that you guys first carved when you arrived in

2601
02:57:07,576 --> 02:57:14,170
Whitestone from what was previously an abandoned
tavern that has been reclaimed. As you enter, you

2602
02:57:14,170 --> 02:57:20,562
can see now the covered windows have been
reopened. The place, while not a fully functional

2603
02:57:20,562 --> 02:57:25,317
tavern yet, is in the process of being renovated
to start a business again soon. So as you enter

2604
02:57:25,317 --> 02:57:30,420
the front door you see about five different
carpenters or various workers that are in the

2605
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:33,967
process of renovating the interior that all turn.
"Can I help you?"

2606
02:57:33,967 --> 02:57:42,757
LAURA: Yeah, actually. Don't mind me, I just have
a treehouse to get to. And I walk through and go

2607
02:57:42,757 --> 02:57:44,220
under.

2608
02:57:44,220 --> 02:57:46,588
MATT: Make a persuasion check!

2609
02:57:46,588 --> 02:57:50,460
LAURA: I don't know, man.

2610
02:57:50,460 --> 02:57:53,431
LIAM: It's all right, it's all right. 
Middle of the road.

2611
02:57:53,431 --> 02:57:54,837
LAURA: 15.

2612
02:57:55,072 --> 02:57:58,915
MATT: 15? Okay. The guy looks at you and goes--

2613
02:57:58,915 --> 02:58:01,263
LAURA: I wink at him, keep walking.

2614
02:58:01,263 --> 02:58:04,109
MATT: "I mean, I have no idea what that means,
but--"

2615
02:58:04,109 --> 02:58:08,927
LAURA: But you like it. You like it. And I keep
going.

2616
02:58:08,991 --> 02:58:13,255
MATT: "We're going to send Joseph, just to keep an
eye. Joseph?" And this one guy turns around and he

2617
02:58:13,255 --> 02:58:20,721
looks a little touched. He turns around and goes,
"Okay! I'll follow her."

2618
02:58:20,721 --> 02:58:27,248
LAURA: Joseph? If you could wait at the door, that
would be really helpful.

2619
02:58:27,248 --> 02:58:29,860
MATT: "I can do that!"

2620
02:58:29,860 --> 02:58:30,934
LAURA: Thank you!

2621
02:58:30,934 --> 02:58:38,937
MATT: "Yeah! I'll wait by the door! Right?" "Sure,
whatever, man, go for it. It's fine." And they go

2622
02:58:38,937 --> 02:58:46,048
back to fixing the inside. They're fixing windowsills.
Joe, who seems to be a really sweet guy

2623
02:58:46,216 --> 02:58:50,586
probably in his mid-to-late 30s, shaved head
that's just starting to come in a little bit,

2624
02:58:50,586 --> 02:59:01,534
square jaw, but it's Slingblade-style hung off to
one side a little. But he seems like he's a fair

2625
02:59:01,534 --> 02:59:04,934
worker and intent on the job that is set before
him.

2626
02:59:04,934 --> 02:59:06,702
LAURA: You're doing good work, Joseph!

2627
02:59:06,702 --> 02:59:10,065
MATT: "Thank you!" And he follows you in as you
enter the tunnel and begins to walk in the tunnel

2628
02:59:10,065 --> 02:59:11,090
with you.

2629
02:59:11,090 --> 02:59:12,544
LAURA: At the door!

2630
02:59:12,544 --> 02:59:14,492
MATT: "Ah! Right! This isn't a door."

2631
02:59:14,492 --> 02:59:18,926
LAURA: (laughs) All right. Keep walking.

2632
02:59:18,926 --> 02:59:20,161
MATT: All right.

2633
02:59:20,161 --> 02:59:32,380
LAURA: As I go, I want to put my hands on the
roots and I'm going to say, hey, Sun Tree! I know

2634
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:41,242
I can't hear you, but I really need your help
right now. And I hope you can hear me. I don't

2635
02:59:41,242 --> 02:59:50,803
know how to do this, exactly, but I need to talk
to Pelor, and there's a lot of people that are

2636
02:59:50,874 --> 02:59:58,872
looking at me like I know what I'm doing, but I
have no freaking clue. So if you could help guide

2637
02:59:58,872 --> 03:00:05,991
me, that would be great. I sit down and I keep my
hands on the roots.

2638
03:00:05,991 --> 03:00:15,322
MATT: As you concentrate and keep your hands on
the roots, time passes, what seems like ten, 20,

2639
03:00:15,322 --> 03:00:23,887
30, 60 minutes of silence, occasionally broken by
a voice down the hallway going, "You okay?"

2640
03:00:23,887 --> 03:00:27,939
LAURA: Yes!

2641
03:00:27,939 --> 03:00:38,440
MATT: "All right!" You come back to focusing on
the task at hand, and at times you catch yourself.

2642
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:46,190
You swear you feel the roots get warmer and then
you, conscious of it, and you feel along, and no,

2643
03:00:46,190 --> 03:00:50,658
it's probably about the same. You may have psyched
yourself out, you're not sure. Close your eyes

2644
03:00:50,658 --> 03:00:57,652
again and you focus. As the boredom instinctively
sets in, you have a hard time standing still.

2645
03:00:57,652 --> 03:01:05,299
You're an individual who likes being bombarded
with sensory elements. You're a person who needs

2646
03:01:05,299 --> 03:01:09,309
to know what's going on around you, you always
have been. That sense of self-preservation,

2647
03:01:09,309 --> 03:01:14,758
paranoia, whatever you want to call it, is being
conflicted heavily with the idea of being still,

2648
03:01:14,758 --> 03:01:24,862
quiet, and focused for a protracted period of
time. You're battling that antsiness, you are far

2649
03:01:24,862 --> 03:01:31,481
too conscious of your physical body and the
discomfort you're feeling. I want you to go ahead

2650
03:01:31,481 --> 03:01:39,021
and make a wisdom saving throw.

2651
03:01:39,021 --> 03:01:45,523
LAURA: God damn it! Ten.

2652
03:01:45,523 --> 03:01:53,878
MATT: Ten? You can feel the pain begin to
rise from sitting for so long. Your pelvic bone,

2653
03:01:53,932 --> 03:02:00,025
from being in that position for a long period of
time, is beginning to grow more and more sore. You

2654
03:02:00,081 --> 03:02:04,925
begin to shift in place and as you do, it doesn't
help. So you shift again, that doesn't help. And

2655
03:02:04,925 --> 03:02:11,210
every single position you try and shift, it seems
to throb in pain from being stationary for so long

2656
03:02:11,210 --> 03:02:19,465
in a position that you're not used to. It's
distracting to you. Eventually a voice comes

2657
03:02:19,465 --> 03:02:25,276
through down the hallway that goes, "All right,
we're done and we're leaving. You good?"

2658
03:02:25,276 --> 03:02:27,832
LAURA: Great, Joseph. You know what?

2659
03:02:27,832 --> 03:02:29,448
MATT: "What?"

2660
03:02:29,448 --> 03:02:34,701
LAURA: Thanks! For everything, have a good night.

2661
03:02:34,701 --> 03:02:36,925
MATT: "You too!"

2662
03:02:36,925 --> 03:02:38,318
LAURA: Okay!

2663
03:02:38,318 --> 03:02:39,414
MATT: "You okay in there?"

2664
03:02:39,414 --> 03:02:41,861
LAURA: I'm great, you can go. You can go.

2665
03:02:41,861 --> 03:02:44,437
MATT: "Looks scary."

2666
03:02:44,437 --> 03:02:48,337
LAURA: It's not. But don't come down here, thank
you.

2667
03:02:48,337 --> 03:02:51,752
MATT: "All right. Well, have a good night, miss!"

2668
03:02:51,752 --> 03:02:53,103
LAURA: Okay!

2669
03:02:53,103 --> 03:02:58,533
MATT: You hear the footsteps grow quieter and
quieter and then a (kch) as the hatch that led to

2670
03:02:58,533 --> 03:03:01,641
the basement that you carved the tunnel from
closes.

2671
03:03:01,641 --> 03:03:03,590
LAURA: Is Trinket here with me?

2672
03:03:03,590 --> 03:03:05,095
MATT: Trinket is in your necklace.

2673
03:03:05,095 --> 03:03:06,723
LAURA: Pop that fucker out.

2674
03:03:06,723 --> 03:03:11,718
MATT: Very tight space. There's now a big bear and
you're like (rrr) on the side.

2675
03:03:11,718 --> 03:03:15,729
LAURA: Hi! Sorry about that. Are you okay? Are
you comfy? Are you all right? Is this too big?

2676
03:03:15,781 --> 03:03:24,926
MATT: Backs up into the tunnel partway and is now
borderline Winnie the Pooh in the tree. Trinket's

2677
03:03:24,926 --> 03:03:27,450
like fitting in there, but snugly, but is--

2678
03:03:27,450 --> 03:03:29,920
TRAVIS: Cat trying to squeeze in the shoebox.

2679
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:33,122
LAURA: How much can you stay still?

2680
03:03:33,122 --> 03:03:36,615
MATT: (grunts)

2681
03:03:36,615 --> 03:03:38,451
LAURA: I'm going to cast Speak with Animals.

2682
03:03:38,451 --> 03:03:39,473
MATT: Okay.

2683
03:03:39,473 --> 03:03:41,193
LIAM: (Winnie the Pooh voice) Oh, bother.

2684
03:03:41,193 --> 03:03:42,597
LAURA: Trinket?

2685
03:03:42,679 --> 03:03:44,794
MATT: "I can, I can be still."

2686
03:03:44,794 --> 03:03:47,141
LAURA: Can you come over here?

2687
03:03:47,141 --> 03:03:54,589
MATT: "Oh, I guess." Crawls forward back into the
space, ducking his head under the various tree

2688
03:03:54,589 --> 03:03:55,934
roots like, (grunts)

2689
03:03:55,934 --> 03:04:00,601
LAURA: I'm going to just lay down, dear, I'm just
going to lean on you. I just need you right now.

2690
03:04:00,601 --> 03:04:08,053
MATT: He, as uncomfortable in the moment as it is,
he curls up and forms a crescent, soft bear

2691
03:04:08,053 --> 03:04:10,366
barrier. A bear-rier, if you will.

2692
03:04:10,366 --> 03:04:12,127
(groaning)

2693
03:04:12,127 --> 03:04:13,296
MATT: Sorry.

2694
03:04:13,296 --> 03:04:14,592
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

2695
03:04:14,592 --> 03:04:15,808
LIAM: You did that.

2696
03:04:15,808 --> 03:04:19,328
MATT: You lean back into Trinket and the warmth is
comforting, as it is getting colder here,

2697
03:04:19,328 --> 03:04:27,150
especially beneath the earth in a space that,
aside from the natural earth insulation, the cold

2698
03:04:27,150 --> 03:04:29,115
of the night of Whitestone does get pretty
biting.

2699
03:04:29,115 --> 03:04:30,125
LAURA: Yeah.

2700
03:04:30,125 --> 03:04:34,765
MATT: The warmth is welcome. And you think
back and you have really no sense of what time it

2701
03:04:34,836 --> 03:04:37,672
is, you really don't. You have no idea how long
you've been in there. It could have been minutes,

2702
03:04:37,672 --> 03:04:40,519
hours, it's hard to tell.

2703
03:04:40,519 --> 03:04:46,649
LAURA: It's days down here, Trinket. We're
imprisoned forever! This fucking title! I thought

2704
03:04:46,649 --> 03:04:48,755
I wanted it! I thought I did!

2705
03:04:48,755 --> 03:04:51,394
MATT: Trinket goes, "Really?"

2706
03:04:51,394 --> 03:04:52,886
LAURA: Yeah, I know!

2707
03:04:52,886 --> 03:04:54,262
MATT: "I don't want to stay here forever."

2708
03:04:54,262 --> 03:04:57,069
LAURA: Well, it's not going to be forever,
eventually we'll get sick of it, dear.

2709
03:04:57,069 --> 03:04:58,269
MATT: "Okay."

2710
03:04:58,269 --> 03:04:59,830
LAURA: And then we'll leave.

2711
03:04:59,830 --> 03:05:01,886
MATT: And Trinket kind of falls asleep.

2712
03:05:01,886 --> 03:05:18,927
LAURA: I lean back on him and just look up at the
roots and say, oh, Pelor! You have something to

2713
03:05:18,927 --> 03:05:26,782
tell me and I want to hear it! And I'm getting
tired of being down here but I swear I'm fine, I'm

2714
03:05:26,782 --> 03:05:31,374
going to keep concentrating, because I'm committed
to you and I'm committed to this Hunt and I'm

2715
03:05:31,374 --> 03:05:40,956
committed to this title and this city... and your
tree, and your leaves, and your trunk, and these

2716
03:05:40,956 --> 03:05:45,435
roots, and the dirt around me, and all of that.
And I'm going to keep thinking.

2717
03:05:45,435 --> 03:05:49,213
MATT: Okay. As you're thinking about this, you're
leaning back into Trinket. The warmth is

2718
03:05:49,412 --> 03:05:54,918
comforting. Make another wisdom saving throw.

2719
03:05:54,918 --> 03:05:55,867
LIAM: Girl!

2720
03:05:55,867 --> 03:05:56,832
LAURA: All right!

2721
03:05:56,832 --> 03:05:57,905
LIAM: Come on, girl!

2722
03:05:57,905 --> 03:05:59,295
MARISHA: Come on, get it!

2723
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:02,058
LAURA: Oh, I thought that was a 20, but it's not.

2724
03:06:02,058 --> 03:06:02,918
LIAM: Not quite.

2725
03:06:02,918 --> 03:06:04,166
LAURA: 15.

2726
03:06:04,166 --> 03:06:10,108
MATT: 15, okay. You lean back on Trinket and you
watch this darkened space where there's no light,

2727
03:06:10,162 --> 03:06:14,789
so you're relying on your elvish Darkvision, your
half-elf's Darkvision, you're still taking in this

2728
03:06:14,789 --> 03:06:20,896
space. There's no color, but you understand the
shapes, the shapes of the roots, and what seems

2729
03:06:20,896 --> 03:06:28,777
like days go by and your mind wanders to Percival,
your mind wanders to your recent venture in the

2730
03:06:28,777 --> 03:06:35,642
Hells, to Pike's return, to wondering what the
hell Scanlan's up to, to what does this even mean,

2731
03:06:35,642 --> 03:06:40,294
is this worth it? What are you going to do, stay
here? The whole point of you and your brother was

2732
03:06:40,294 --> 03:06:46,699
to go and wander and not be behooven to anything,
to be free. But then, what is freedom at that

2733
03:06:46,699 --> 03:06:52,052
point? Is it taking responsibility? Your mind
cyclically continues to fold in itself, all these

2734
03:06:52,052 --> 03:06:56,539
questions and these answers, and then questions
and those answers, and before you begin to

2735
03:06:56,539 --> 03:07:01,958
realize, you begin to fall asleep. You swear for a
moment you begin to see the roots of the Sun Tree

2736
03:07:01,958 --> 03:07:10,033
begin to grow, and curl in your direction, and you
try and move but you find yourself unable to,

2737
03:07:10,033 --> 03:07:15,403
paralyzed against the back of Trinket. You glance
over your shoulder, just look over it. Trinket

2738
03:07:15,403 --> 03:07:21,923
isn't Trinket, Trinket is more roots that are
curled in around you. There is a clasp of various

2739
03:07:21,923 --> 03:07:27,159
growing subterranean plant life that is just
beginning to impose in your space. Your vision

2740
03:07:27,159 --> 03:07:28,897
begins to dull to blackness.

2741
03:07:28,897 --> 03:07:33,319
You watch as the roots reach out and grab around
the sides of your head and your neck and pull you

2742
03:07:33,319 --> 03:07:39,834
and lift you up, and you start having flashes,
memories, of the interior of the tree in the

2743
03:07:39,834 --> 03:07:46,303
Feywild, of the way those roots looked,
ever-reaching, hungry, trying to grasp whatever

2744
03:07:46,303 --> 03:07:53,235
life and emotion they can find. And that fear
begins to seek up into your throat, but you

2745
03:07:53,235 --> 03:07:59,151
withstand it. Your understanding of the importance
of this and knowing that this can't be real, you

2746
03:07:59,151 --> 03:08:07,128
shrug off this vision in spite of the roots
bringing darkness to your vision. Everything goes

2747
03:08:07,128 --> 03:08:18,058
cold and still. And then the darkness opens up
once more, like your eyes, the lids just fold to

2748
03:08:18,112 --> 03:08:26,877
reveal a beautiful moonlight-dappled pristine
glass-like pond in the middle of a deep forest.

2749
03:08:26,877 --> 03:08:32,313
A very thickly wooded forest with a very, very
small series of gaps in the canopy that allow

2750
03:08:32,500 --> 03:08:40,745
these beams of white moonlight to hit the surface,
to refract. Still, calm, cold, quiet. A very faint

2751
03:08:40,745 --> 03:08:44,587
mist has gathered across the surface of this
water.

2752
03:08:44,587 --> 03:08:55,334
You just observe, timeless. You don't feel
yourself breathing, and you feel like, "I should

2753
03:08:55,351 --> 03:09:00,422
"be breathing. Am I dead? I should breathe, that's
what it means to live." But you don't sense that

2754
03:09:00,422 --> 03:09:04,117
experience, and by the time that thought crosses
you to the point where you can feel the panic

2755
03:09:04,117 --> 03:09:11,432
beginning to brim up in the back of your mind, the
water breaks and you watch as a shape emerges from

2756
03:09:11,432 --> 03:09:16,577
the surface of the water. Ripples begin to cascade
out from the outside of the shape as it steps,

2757
03:09:16,577 --> 03:09:24,420
one, two, three times, bipedal in movement, this
large humanoid shape begins to step forth from the

2758
03:09:24,420 --> 03:09:34,058
water. You see this almost ten-foot-tall humanoid
mass begin to step out from the water. You can

2759
03:09:34,058 --> 03:09:40,715
see, from the glistening liquid that is just
coasting off of its back and body, unkept by any

2760
03:09:40,715 --> 03:09:47,970
fur or flesh, there is a hide, a rhino-like thick
gray scaled almost hide, that seems to cover the

2761
03:09:47,970 --> 03:09:54,628
entirety of its form. But what you see is its
back, this massive muscled shoulder shelf, and two

2762
03:09:54,628 --> 03:10:00,163
tree trunk-like arms that just swing and dangle
from the sides as it begins to step further and

2763
03:10:00,163 --> 03:10:10,883
further out of this pond. And at first you see
this creature, but you still sense it belonging.

2764
03:10:10,883 --> 03:10:21,031
And then you sense that there's a reason for this
emergence, and at that point you watch as the

2765
03:10:21,031 --> 03:10:25,734
creature, which is now maybe up to its waist,
pushing onto knee-depth in the water, as it

2766
03:10:25,734 --> 03:10:29,476
reaches the edge of the surface. You don't see its
face, you just see over its shoulder and its

2767
03:10:29,476 --> 03:10:36,498
massive back, no head emerging over top. It stops
and turns back, and as the shoulder turns you can

2768
03:10:36,498 --> 03:10:45,674
see the head, which is actually protruding forward
out of the torso, this slumped plated armored head

2769
03:10:45,674 --> 03:10:51,063
with a jaw that hinges underneath closed with a
series of teeth in the bottom, and what you see

2770
03:10:51,063 --> 03:10:58,093
for just a glimmer are its yellow eyes glowing,
all six of them, in rows of two across the top as

2771
03:10:58,093 --> 03:11:06,409
it glances back in your direction. And it just
leaps out of the water and begins darting through

2772
03:11:06,409 --> 03:11:14,100
trees and vanishing in the distance, and you
realize the Hunt is on. Your vision comes back to

2773
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:18,212
you, there's no vines, and Trinket is just
sleeping behind you, and you're there in the cold

2774
03:11:18,212 --> 03:11:21,089
darkness beneath the Sun Tree. What do you do?

2775
03:11:21,089 --> 03:11:27,995
LAURA: (laughs) It worked! It worked! You are
awesome, Sun Tree! You're the best! Pelor, that is

2776
03:11:27,995 --> 03:11:37,720
some fucked up shit. Okay. Trinket, wake up! We
have to go hunt a thing that looks really scary!

2777
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:40,541
I'm going to die! How about you?

2778
03:11:40,541 --> 03:11:45,070
MATT: "Um. Hopefully not?"

2779
03:11:45,070 --> 03:11:47,289
LAURA: Good call! Let's go!

2780
03:11:47,289 --> 03:11:48,856
MATT: "Okay."

2781
03:11:49,068 --> 03:11:51,212
LAURA: Oh fuck.

2782
03:11:51,212 --> 03:11:53,937
LIAM: Get it, girl.

2783
03:11:53,937 --> 03:11:55,392
MATT: So what're you doing?

2784
03:11:55,392 --> 03:11:56,878
LAURA: Do I just fucking go straight for it?

2785
03:11:56,878 --> 03:11:58,831
MATT: What are you doing? What are you doing?

2786
03:11:58,831 --> 03:12:03,836
LAURA: I don't know! I don't know how to go find
the lake that he came out of!

2787
03:12:03,836 --> 03:12:05,386
LIAM: You're the best!

2788
03:12:05,386 --> 03:12:07,149
MARISHA: You're a fucking ranger!

2789
03:12:07,149 --> 03:12:10,949
LAURA: Do I remember what it smelled like? It's
really fast, it was going through the trees. Do I

2790
03:12:10,949 --> 03:12:14,395
remember a specific look? Do I remember hearing
about a lake in the woods?

2791
03:12:14,395 --> 03:12:19,534
MATT: You remember seeing it as it leapt, you got
a very quick glimpse at its shape and its feet,

2792
03:12:19,534 --> 03:12:29,609
its giant clawed fingers, its humanoid-like hands.
You don't know of a scent, per se. Go ahead and

2793
03:12:29,609 --> 03:12:34,618
roll an investigation check to look back over the
memory of what you have and pick out details.

2794
03:12:34,618 --> 03:12:36,602
LAURA: Okay, and I definitely put my armor back
on.

2795
03:12:36,602 --> 03:12:39,904
MATT: Mm-hm. So you're putting on your armor as
you're rushing out of the area.

2796
03:12:39,904 --> 03:12:41,145
LAURA: What am I rolling?

2797
03:12:41,145 --> 03:12:42,008
MATT: Investigation.

2798
03:12:42,008 --> 03:12:43,140
LAURA: I'm rolling really great tonight.

2799
03:12:43,140 --> 03:12:44,418
LIAM: You are rolling dogshit tonight.

2800
03:12:44,418 --> 03:12:46,649
LAURA: Which is great! 11.

2801
03:12:46,649 --> 03:12:52,813
MATT: 11, okay. Best you can tell, given the
circumstances, the brief vision you had, the angle

2802
03:12:52,813 --> 03:13:00,838
of the moonbeams are coming from the right and
left, meaning from your perspective, they're

2803
03:13:00,838 --> 03:13:06,181
coming at this angle upon the water. And as you
step out into the night, you can see the moon is

2804
03:13:06,181 --> 03:13:12,317
in a certain place in the sky where your vision,
if that is in--

2805
03:13:12,317 --> 03:13:14,541
LAURA: If I turn that way, it'll be coming at me
this way.

2806
03:13:14,541 --> 03:13:18,292
MATT: Depending on if it's in a northern direction
or not. You're trying to think of where the lake

2807
03:13:18,292 --> 03:13:24,784
was. There are a couple of ponds that you've seen
in the forest. You're not fully aware. Percival

2808
03:13:24,784 --> 03:13:26,599
might be the person to ask about this.

2809
03:13:26,599 --> 03:13:31,623
LAURA: Okay, okay. I'm going to run to Percy. Do I
need to-- ooh, am I allowed to ask him? I'm going

2810
03:13:31,623 --> 03:13:32,723
to run to Percy.

2811
03:13:32,723 --> 03:13:36,558
MATT: Okay. Percival, you've kind of been hoping
that everything worked out okay. You haven't heard

2812
03:13:36,558 --> 03:13:40,947
anything from Vex'ahlia since the morning. She's
been gone for a good 13 hours at this point, and

2813
03:13:40,947 --> 03:13:42,597
it's close to midnight.

2814
03:13:42,597 --> 03:13:44,247
LAURA: At least I got some sleep!

2815
03:13:44,247 --> 03:13:45,464
MATT: A little bit.

2816
03:13:45,464 --> 03:13:47,945
TALIESIN: I'm in my study working on things.

2817
03:13:47,945 --> 03:13:52,739
MATT: You're in the process of going through books
and such, and all of a sudden there's a rush of

2818
03:13:52,739 --> 03:13:55,415
footsteps and Vex'ahlia comes bursting into your
room.

2819
03:13:55,415 --> 03:13:57,217
LAURA: I had a vision!

2820
03:13:57,217 --> 03:14:00,270
TALIESIN: Excellent! Excellent!

2821
03:14:00,345 --> 03:14:04,610
LAURA: Yeah! It looks really, really scary though!
So thank you!

2822
03:14:04,610 --> 03:14:07,491
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, and excited!

2823
03:14:07,491 --> 03:14:09,310
LAURA: Okay, I have a question.

2824
03:14:09,310 --> 03:14:10,215
TALIESIN: Yes.

2825
03:14:10,215 --> 03:14:15,066
LAURA: I saw a lake, a glade, do you know of any?

2826
03:14:15,066 --> 03:14:18,370
MATT: She describes the pond, and it's a smallish
pond.

2827
03:14:18,370 --> 03:14:19,963
LAURA: Glass-like.

2828
03:14:19,963 --> 03:14:25,457
TALIESIN: I have a map in my study and I just pull
it out and just hand it. I must have a map.

2829
03:14:25,457 --> 03:14:26,555
MATT: You do, yeah.

2830
03:14:26,555 --> 03:14:32,095
LAURA: Percy, do you know of anything that's big
and tall, around ten feet, has six eyes going

2831
03:14:32,095 --> 03:14:37,935
straight down in a row in pairs, really thick hide
skin, legs like trunks--

2832
03:14:37,935 --> 03:14:39,690
TALIESIN: Grog when I'm drunk?

2833
03:14:39,690 --> 03:14:40,886
LAURA: Well.

2834
03:14:40,886 --> 03:14:42,867
TALIESIN: Do I know anything?

2835
03:14:42,867 --> 03:14:47,387
MATT This is not your specialty. You haven't dealt
with the Grey Hunt personally, and this is not

2836
03:14:47,387 --> 03:14:48,689
ringing a bell.

2837
03:14:48,689 --> 03:14:50,313
LAURA: Is it usually different creatures?

2838
03:14:50,313 --> 03:14:51,685
TALIESIN: It's different every time.

2839
03:14:51,685 --> 03:14:58,754
LAURA; Okay. Hey! Do you remember when we were
coming here, and we were camping out in the woods

2840
03:14:58,754 --> 03:15:07,460
outside and there was a woman, I think, that
walked by with a pack of, was it wolves?

2841
03:15:07,460 --> 03:15:13,123
TALIESIN: Yes. That was a long time ago.

2842
03:15:13,123 --> 03:15:14,751
LAURA: Did that have anything to do with this?

2843
03:15:14,751 --> 03:15:16,138
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2844
03:15:16,138 --> 03:15:27,189
LAURA: Great. Just wondering. Just thought of it.
Okay. I might see you later! And I go.

2845
03:15:27,189 --> 03:15:32,153
MATT: As you dart out, Trinket lumbering after
you, you look at the map, and based on the

2846
03:15:32,153 --> 03:15:38,414
conversation you had as well, there are two
different locations that have ponds roughly the

2847
03:15:38,414 --> 03:15:44,834
size that your vision revealed to you. Both of
them have a slight break in the canopy. That's a

2848
03:15:44,834 --> 03:15:49,858
key that you remember from this, and being a
tracker specifically you know that most of the

2849
03:15:49,858 --> 03:15:54,986
forest, the Parchwood itself, is very dense
canopy, it rarely has breaks enough to allow that

2850
03:15:54,986 --> 03:15:59,410
much moonlight to pass through. I need you to go
ahead and make an intelligence check.

2851
03:15:59,410 --> 03:16:02,231
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, roll good. Roll good, all
right?

2852
03:16:02,231 --> 03:16:03,265
LIAM: Come on, Laura Bailey.

2853
03:16:03,265 --> 03:16:04,561
LAURA: Stop rolling like shit, all right?

2854
03:16:04,561 --> 03:16:05,998
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on.

2855
03:16:05,998 --> 03:16:07,072
LIAM: Laura!

2856
03:16:07,072 --> 03:16:10,429
LAURA: Oh god, I thought that said a one.
Investigation, 24.

2857
03:16:10,429 --> 03:16:11,504
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2858
03:16:11,504 --> 03:16:12,531
MARISHA: Hey!

2859
03:16:12,531 --> 03:16:13,759
TRAVIS: Get it, get it!

2860
03:16:13,759 --> 03:16:15,420
MATT: This is an intelligence check, so you should
add your intelligence modifier.

2861
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:16,331
LAURA: Fuck.

2862
03:16:16,331 --> 03:16:18,175
MARISHA: Aw. Hey hey hey.

2863
03:16:18,175 --> 03:16:20,966
LAURA: An intelligence check would be 19.

2864
03:16:20,966 --> 03:16:22,053
ALL: Hey!

2865
03:16:22,053 --> 03:16:23,387
MATT: That's still very good!

2866
03:16:23,387 --> 03:16:24,272
LAURA: Okay.

2867
03:16:24,272 --> 03:16:26,835
MATT: You ascertain, between the two locations on
the map, the one that would contain both the right

2868
03:16:26,835 --> 03:16:31,564
amount of canopy that would be open, and the size
of the pond, and the location of the moon, would

2869
03:16:31,564 --> 03:16:37,531
be far, far west of Whitestone, slightly north,
beginning to just get near to where the Alabaster

2870
03:16:37,531 --> 03:16:41,485
Sierra mountain range hits the bottom of the
valley, so you know that's probably your best bet

2871
03:16:41,485 --> 03:16:42,479
to get there.

2872
03:16:42,479 --> 03:16:44,707
LAURA: I hop on Trinket's back and we take off.

2873
03:16:44,707 --> 03:16:50,729
MATT: You leap on to the back of your bear. He
goes into a full sprint out of the city. The few

2874
03:16:50,729 --> 03:16:56,256
folks that are kind of drunkenly wandering through
the city or in the process of making their way

2875
03:16:56,256 --> 03:17:00,568
home, they all step aside as Vex'ahlia, Lady
Vex'ahlia of the Grey Hunt--

2876
03:17:00,568 --> 03:17:01,958
LAURA: I'm a lady!

2877
03:17:01,958 --> 03:17:05,912
MATT: -- on top of Trinket the bear, comes tearing
through Whitestone to the west, barreling towards

2878
03:17:05,912 --> 03:17:12,560
the gap in the exterior wall of the city, and
charging into the depth of the Parchwood Forest.

2879
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:20,217
Following the map and keeping tabs on direction,
about 40 minutes or so of travel, you eventually

2880
03:17:20,217 --> 03:17:29,999
come upon where you think this pond should be. Go
ahead and roll a survival with advantage.

2881
03:17:29,999 --> 03:17:33,109
LAURA: Oh yeah, because this is my favored
terrain!

2882
03:17:33,109 --> 03:17:34,236
MATT: Yes.

2883
03:17:34,236 --> 03:17:36,527
LAURA: That was the same thing both times.

2884
03:17:36,527 --> 03:17:37,823
LIAM: Oh, double 14s.

2885
03:17:37,823 --> 03:17:38,936
LAURA: So 22.

2886
03:17:38,936 --> 03:17:43,473
MATT: 22. You make your way and you find the pond,
and you recognize it exactly the moment you get

2887
03:17:43,473 --> 03:17:45,884
there. This is exactly the pond in your vision.

2888
03:17:45,884 --> 03:17:46,987
LAURA: This is where it was!

2889
03:17:46,987 --> 03:17:49,596
MATT: You glance over and start finding your way
around the edge, and eventually you find the

2890
03:17:49,596 --> 03:17:55,282
thick, heavy footfalls right beneath the water. He
leapt straight out of the water so there were no

2891
03:17:55,282 --> 03:17:57,936
tracks directly out of it, but you look just
beneath the surface.

2892
03:17:57,936 --> 03:17:59,475
LAURA: I remember him jumping into the trees!

2893
03:17:59,475 --> 03:18:02,273
MATT: Yes, you look up and you can see a few
branches are broken, and you begin to trace the

2894
03:18:02,273 --> 03:18:03,373
direction of where it went.

2895
03:18:03,373 --> 03:18:06,372
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself, and
I'm going to stealth after him.

2896
03:18:06,372 --> 03:18:09,594
MATT: Okay. All right, go ahead and roll a stealth
check. Are you still on Trinket for this?

2897
03:18:09,594 --> 03:18:11,945
LAURA: I'm going to put him in the locket for the
time being.

2898
03:18:11,945 --> 03:18:15,164
MATT: Trinket goes into the necklace. Go ahead and
roll stealth with your Pass Without a Trace

2899
03:18:15,164 --> 03:18:16,236
bonus.

2900
03:18:16,236 --> 03:18:18,419
LAURA: Oh, right! 33.

2901
03:18:18,419 --> 03:18:22,782
MATT: 33, okay. Very quietly, you dart up into the
trees and begin leaping from broken branch to

2902
03:18:22,782 --> 03:18:28,017
broken branch. Eventually it leads you into a
small opening between a series-- the trees here

2903
03:18:28,017 --> 03:18:31,231
are truly thick, but there's certain areas where
they begin to separate a bit, and you can see

2904
03:18:31,397 --> 03:18:35,406
heavy impacts where it leapt down and found some
soft ground and begins running. And you can see

2905
03:18:35,406 --> 03:18:39,465
the tracks, and you take a moment and study these
tracks, and you can see exactly how these thick

2906
03:18:39,465 --> 03:18:46,426
three-toed feet of the creature dig into the dirt,
and you take a very, very close watch on them. I need

2907
03:18:46,497 --> 03:18:49,044
you to go ahead and make another wisdom survival
check to see where those

2908
03:18:49,044 --> 03:18:50,638
footfalls will take you.

2909
03:18:50,638 --> 03:18:58,731
LAURA: So again, a 24. Oh wait, 22.

2910
03:18:58,731 --> 03:19:02,706
MATT: 22, okay. So you begin darting through, and
you notice there are points where it leaps into

2911
03:19:02,706 --> 03:19:07,815
the trees and vanishes. The trail stops, but you
can follow brief bits. But this creature's heavy,

2912
03:19:07,815 --> 03:19:13,103
you can see it doesn't leap into the boughs and
hang on a branch, it leaps up onto an actual tree

2913
03:19:13,103 --> 03:19:17,506
trunk and then leaps off the trunk, and where it
does, the bark splinters and breaks. Whatever this

2914
03:19:17,506 --> 03:19:22,597
is, it's extremely dense. It's extremely heavy.
And to have the power and strength to lift its

2915
03:19:22,597 --> 03:19:29,741
form on that thickness means it has some power
behind it. Continuing to keep tabs, you're darting

2916
03:19:29,741 --> 03:19:36,065
through the dark woods. Out of the right of you,
you hear a sudden noise, and you are surprised, as

2917
03:19:36,065 --> 03:19:40,675
a series of birds come fluttering past you,
apparently startled from something nearby, and you

2918
03:19:40,675 --> 03:19:48,224
watch as a forest elk darts past and is a sign
of-- you know, naturally in this environment-- of

2919
03:19:48,224 --> 03:19:52,768
relatively recent movement. And you get the sense
that you might be gaining on this creature,

2920
03:19:52,768 --> 03:19:53,922
whatever it's charging.

2921
03:19:53,922 --> 03:19:55,530
LAURA: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2922
03:19:55,530 --> 03:20:00,217
MATT: So as you're leaping and running and making
the best possible path you can, eventually, the

2923
03:20:00,217 --> 03:20:06,155
trail begins to grow a little cold, and you find a
small glade--

2924
03:20:06,155 --> 03:20:07,449
LAURA: A small poo.

2925
03:20:07,449 --> 03:20:13,557
MATT: Yeah, I know. About 30 feet across. The
trees open and there's this space and it's

2926
03:20:13,557 --> 03:20:16,641
pristine, untouched. The trail ends entirely.

2927
03:20:16,641 --> 03:20:18,358
LAURA: It's just gone?

2928
03:20:18,358 --> 03:20:21,681
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

2929
03:20:21,681 --> 03:20:22,940
LIAM: Ceiling!

2930
03:20:22,940 --> 03:20:24,465
LAURA: Can I look up?

2931
03:20:24,465 --> 03:20:25,986
MATT: Make a perception check.

2932
03:20:25,986 --> 03:20:28,433
MARISHA: You're making me chew my nails.

2933
03:20:28,433 --> 03:20:30,702
LAURA: It's an open glade, you said?

2934
03:20:30,702 --> 03:20:36,072
MATT: It's a clearing in the forest where the
canopy opens a bit, and there's thick brush, and

2935
03:20:36,072 --> 03:20:41,572
you can see some of the roots of the trees pop up
in places, but as opposed to previously, where the

2936
03:20:41,572 --> 03:20:46,094
trees are pretty clustered together and you can
find your way through the slight gaps, this area

2937
03:20:46,094 --> 03:20:48,487
is open by about 30 feet.

2938
03:20:48,487 --> 03:20:58,359
LAURA: That's okay. I get advantage because that's
my favored terrain. That's cocked. I can see

2939
03:20:58,359 --> 03:21:00,133
that's a four, though.

2940
03:21:00,133 --> 03:21:02,886
TRAVIS: It's cocked. It's leaning up against the
side.

2941
03:21:02,886 --> 03:21:03,844
LIAM: Go again.

2942
03:21:03,844 --> 03:21:04,969
LAURA: That's worse.

2943
03:21:04,969 --> 03:21:08,118
LIAM: One and a two!

2944
03:21:08,118 --> 03:21:10,001
ALL: Oh no.

2945
03:21:10,001 --> 03:21:14,052
LAURA: But my perception is 13, so that's 15 for
perception.

2946
03:21:14,052 --> 03:21:16,343
LIAM: That's great, because you're badass.

2947
03:21:16,343 --> 03:21:26,711
LAURA: Wow. Really? You dicks. Why are you
betraying me in this moment that I need you the

2948
03:21:26,711 --> 03:21:27,875
most?

2949
03:21:27,875 --> 03:21:38,577
MATT: Okay, so as you reach this clearing, you
glance about, and it appears to be empty. There's

2950
03:21:38,577 --> 03:21:42,088
nothing here. There's no sign. You can attempt to
find tracks, if you'd like.

2951
03:21:42,088 --> 03:21:45,679
LAURA: But I'd have to hop down on the
ground.

2952
03:21:45,739 --> 03:21:47,607
MATT: You're currently up in the tree, yes.

2953
03:21:47,607 --> 03:21:49,498
LAURA: I'm still stealthed, though.

2954
03:21:49,498 --> 03:21:50,813
MATT: You are.

2955
03:21:50,813 --> 03:21:57,544
LAURA: I'm going to climb down the tree.

2956
03:21:57,544 --> 03:22:02,926
MATT: Okay, you find your way, stepping onto the
somewhat soft floor of the forest.

2957
03:22:02,926 --> 03:22:11,055
LAURA: Oh, that's actually really good. I'm going
to take a minute. I don't know what kind of

2958
03:22:11,055 --> 03:22:16,243
creature it is, though. I don't know if I can use
my Primeval Awareness.

2959
03:22:16,243 --> 03:22:18,322
MATT: Well, you can certainly try.

2960
03:22:18,322 --> 03:22:20,236
LAURA: I'm going to try my Primeval Awareness.

2961
03:22:20,236 --> 03:22:23,945
MATT: Okay, and what are you concentrating on?

2962
03:22:23,945 --> 03:22:25,762
LAURA: Maybe--

2963
03:22:25,762 --> 03:22:29,649
LIAM: Turducken.

2964
03:22:29,649 --> 03:22:38,404
LAURA: I've got aberrations. It's not a celestial,
probably. It didn't seem like an elemental. So

2965
03:22:38,404 --> 03:22:41,448
I've got fiends. Those are guys that come from--

2966
03:22:41,448 --> 03:22:42,971
LIAM: That's where we just were.

2967
03:22:42,971 --> 03:22:46,398
LAURA: Yeah, the Hells. The aberrations.

2968
03:22:46,398 --> 03:22:47,849
LIAM: Possible.

2969
03:22:47,849 --> 03:22:49,388
LAURA: Fey.

2970
03:22:49,388 --> 03:22:51,575
LIAM and MARISHA: (uncertain noises)

2971
03:22:51,575 --> 03:22:55,650
LAURA: I'm going to go aberrations. Do I have to
choose one?

2972
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:56,893
MATT: Yeah.

2973
03:22:56,893 --> 03:22:59,267
LAURA: Aberrations are what, like a beholder?

2974
03:22:59,267 --> 03:23:00,495
LIAM: Grody things.

2975
03:23:00,495 --> 03:23:07,276
MATT: Things that generally come from some touch
of the Far Realm.

2976
03:23:07,276 --> 03:23:09,499
LAURA: I'm going to focus on that.

2977
03:23:09,499 --> 03:23:15,226
MATT: Okay. As you sit there and focus, what level
are you using? Level one?

2978
03:23:15,226 --> 03:23:21,364
LAURA: Yeah, so it's within a mile of me. Oh, up
to six within my favored terrain.

2979
03:23:21,364 --> 03:23:26,017
MATT: True. All right. You sense no nearby
aberrations.

2980
03:23:26,017 --> 03:23:31,629
LAURA: Okay. Can I take another second and think
about fiends? No, fey.

2981
03:23:31,629 --> 03:23:35,296
MATT: Okay, you concentrate on fey. Nothing.

2982
03:23:35,296 --> 03:23:40,149
LAURA: Gosh darn it! Is there nothing in my
Primeval Awareness? Okay.

2983
03:23:40,149 --> 03:23:43,555
MATT: What are you doing, Vex'ahlia?

2984
03:23:43,555 --> 03:23:47,377
LAURA: I'm going to see if I can find any tracks.

2985
03:23:47,377 --> 03:23:50,451
MATT: Okay, make a survival check with advantage.

2986
03:23:50,451 --> 03:24:02,234
LAURA: Oh, but that's cocked! It's cocked, but
it's a 20, but it's cocked. Okay, that's still

2987
03:24:02,234 --> 03:24:05,442
good. 24.

2988
03:24:05,442 --> 03:24:12,782
MATT: 24. Okay, and also if you could roll stealth
again since you are actively doing something.

2989
03:24:12,956 --> 03:24:14,996
LAURA: I roll twice? Do I roll twice?

2990
03:24:14,996 --> 03:24:16,615
MATT: No, just roll.

2991
03:24:16,673 --> 03:24:17,790
LAURA: 32.

2992
03:24:17,790 --> 03:24:28,196
MATT: 32. Okay. You step out into the shadow,
using the edges, and you do see the very faint

2993
03:24:28,196 --> 03:24:34,511
trail-- not of feet on the ground, but of claw
marks, carefully placed. Almost like it

2994
03:24:34,511 --> 03:24:42,076
monkey-walked along the sides of this glade. The
tracks and claw marks stop in this small cluster

2995
03:24:42,076 --> 03:24:51,193
of bushes where inside, you can just barely see
the faintest hidden glow of six tiny yellow dots.

2996
03:24:51,193 --> 03:24:52,751
LAURA: Is it looking at me?

2997
03:24:52,751 --> 03:24:54,890
MATT: It's hard to tell the direction.

2998
03:24:54,890 --> 03:25:04,920
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to take out an arrow.

2999
03:25:04,920 --> 03:25:07,090
MATT: Okay.

3000
03:25:07,090 --> 03:25:14,691
LAURA: Oh god. And I'm going to fire a Bramble
Shot at the eyes, and I'm Sharpshooter.

3001
03:25:14,691 --> 03:25:20,428
MATT: You are. Okay, Sharpshooter, so minus five
to hit, plus ten to damage. Go for it.

3002
03:25:20,428 --> 03:25:23,640
LAURA: I mean I get no--

3003
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:27,130
LIAM: She doesn't have to do that. She can just
ignore cover.

3004
03:25:27,130 --> 03:25:28,196
LAURA: Three-quarter--

3005
03:25:28,196 --> 03:25:30,170
MATT: Oh, I see. Yeah, you can do that.

3006
03:25:30,170 --> 03:25:33,933
SAM: Sniper, starring Billy Zane.

3007
03:25:33,933 --> 03:25:41,324
TALIESIN: Oh shit, the tiny trees have come out!

3008
03:25:41,324 --> 03:25:44,944
LAURA: Oh! I could, if I didn't put my Hunter's
Mark on it, but I'm going to Hunter's Mark him

3009
03:25:44,944 --> 03:25:46,571
before I do that.

3010
03:25:46,571 --> 03:25:47,899
MATT: Okay.

3011
03:25:47,899 --> 03:25:49,285
SAM: Hunter's Mark.

3012
03:25:49,285 --> 03:25:54,566
TRAVIS: Oh, breaking out the foliage!

3013
03:25:54,566 --> 03:25:57,131
MATT: The general circle here.

3014
03:25:57,131 --> 03:25:59,757
TRAVIS: (sings) It's a circle of trees.

3015
03:25:59,757 --> 03:26:02,838
MATT: As I do not have the actual mini for the
creature this is working for, but this will give

3016
03:26:02,838 --> 03:26:04,497
the idea.

3017
03:26:04,497 --> 03:26:07,871
TRAVIS: Oh my god, look at that thing.

3018
03:26:07,871 --> 03:26:11,699
LAURA: Oh, he's huge. Maybe this was a mistake. I
should have talked to him.

3019
03:26:11,699 --> 03:26:14,561
TRAVIS: I should have talked? No.

3020
03:26:14,561 --> 03:26:17,014
LAURA: I'm trying to Bramble Shot him.

3021
03:26:17,014 --> 03:26:18,245
LIAM: You've got this.

3022
03:26:18,245 --> 03:26:21,427
MATT: Okay, we'll put that there.

3023
03:26:21,427 --> 03:26:24,032
LIAM: (sings) Matt owns tiny trees!

3024
03:26:24,032 --> 03:26:31,196
LAURA: And wait, before I did that, I get my broom
ready, and then I'm going to do what I said.

3025
03:26:31,196 --> 03:26:38,925
MATT: Okay, you get your broom ever so carefully
ready. You Hunter's Mark him.

3026
03:26:38,925 --> 03:26:43,325
TRAVIS: Like that guy when he's unloading the
shotgun in Jurassic Park?

3027
03:26:43,325 --> 03:26:45,417
LAURA: Yeah, clever girl!

3028
03:26:45,417 --> 03:26:47,984
(laughter)

3029
03:26:47,984 --> 03:26:50,395
LAURA: Oh no, is that what this is going to be?

3030
03:26:50,395 --> 03:26:54,813
MATT: Hunter's Mark and you're taking your Bramble
Shot. Go for it.

3031
03:26:54,813 --> 03:26:56,367
LAURA: I got 29.

3032
03:26:56,367 --> 03:27:00,181
MATT: 29. That hits. What's the saving throw on
that?

3033
03:27:00,181 --> 03:27:02,568
LAURA: DC 17.

3034
03:27:02,568 --> 03:27:06,545
MATT: That is a 20. Sorry.

3035
03:27:06,545 --> 03:27:10,144
LAURA: He is not restrained, but he does take an
additional 4d8 of damage.

3036
03:27:10,144 --> 03:27:11,275
MATT: Yes.

3037
03:27:11,275 --> 03:27:23,913
LAURA: Which is right here. Ten, 15, 21 Bramble
Shot damage.

3038
03:27:23,913 --> 03:27:25,242
LIAM: Thorns.

3039
03:27:25,242 --> 03:27:37,987
LAURA: Yes. Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14. Was this a
surprise attack?

3040
03:27:37,987 --> 03:27:39,434
MATT: Yes.

3041
03:27:39,434 --> 03:27:42,006
LAURA: So isn't that an automatic crit as an
Assassin?

3042
03:27:42,006 --> 03:27:47,810
MATT: Yeah, because you're an Assassin, it is. So
with all the dice involved there, that's 21 times

3043
03:27:47,810 --> 03:27:49,318
two, that's 42.

3044
03:27:49,318 --> 03:27:52,464
MATT: Plus your arrow. What did you roll for the
arrow?

3045
03:27:52,464 --> 03:27:55,421
LAURA: Plus the what?

3046
03:27:55,421 --> 03:27:57,143
MATT: What's the actual arrow damage?

3047
03:27:57,143 --> 03:27:59,703
LAURA: Arrow damage was two, lightning damage was
two.

3048
03:27:59,703 --> 03:28:02,592
MATT: Okay, so that's eight, plus whatever your
modifier is.

3049
03:28:02,592 --> 03:28:09,369
LAURA: One for Hunter's Mark, and then I get a
Sneak Attack on him, too. And then four for that.

3050
03:28:09,369 --> 03:28:13,561
MATT: Nice! That is 56 points of damage.

3051
03:28:13,561 --> 03:28:18,187
LAURA: Plus ten additional for the eight and the
two for the bracers.

3052
03:28:18,187 --> 03:28:27,483
MATT: Right. Never mind, that's 66 points of
damage. As you pull back and carefully aim, the

3053
03:28:27,483 --> 03:28:32,699
arrow disappears and you watch as there's a flash
of green energy, the arrow impacting on this

3054
03:28:32,699 --> 03:28:40,569
creature, and the vines curl around. You hear a
(roar) and the bushes explode as this entity steps

3055
03:28:40,569 --> 03:28:46,133
out, tearing the vines off its body, throwing them
to the ground as they shrivel and shake and then

3056
03:28:46,133 --> 03:28:53,467
turn to dust and dissipate into the underbrush. As
the creature steps out and looks directly at you,

3057
03:28:53,467 --> 03:29:02,313
its six glowing eyes in a three by three pattern
staring right at you, the arcing of the energy

3058
03:29:02,313 --> 03:29:09,851
finishing throughout its body, it stands upright
for a moment. Its hunched form goes almost more

3059
03:29:09,851 --> 03:29:16,115
humanoid and it looks at you with an intelligence
that you didn't expect. It takes a step, and

3060
03:29:16,115 --> 03:29:23,052
another step, and seems to almost give you a nod
of respect. Roll initiative.

3061
03:29:23,052 --> 03:29:26,945
(cheering, laughter)

3062
03:29:26,945 --> 03:29:31,054
LIAM: Laura Bailey one-on-one Dungeons and Dragons
fight!

3063
03:29:31,054 --> 03:29:35,983
LAURA: Oh no! Only ten. Oh, wait. Do I get to roll
twice because I'm in my favored terrain?

3064
03:29:35,983 --> 03:29:40,854
MATT: All right, you call on this favored terrain
thing a lot. Let me see what it actually helps.

3065
03:29:40,854 --> 03:29:42,707
(laughter)

3066
03:29:42,707 --> 03:29:48,061
MATT: There are specifics as to what your favored
terrain is aided by. Do I win Dungeons and Dragons

3067
03:29:48,061 --> 03:29:49,473
'cause of my favored terrain?

3068
03:29:49,473 --> 03:29:53,179
TALIESIN: That's funny because Dungeons and
Dragons is my favored terrain.

3069
03:29:53,368 --> 03:29:55,154
(laughter)

3070
03:29:55,154 --> 03:29:56,751
LAURA: It all makes sense now.

3071
03:29:56,751 --> 03:29:59,502
TRAVIS: I should really be rolling better in
taverns, though.

3072
03:29:59,502 --> 03:30:04,992
TALIESIN: Tavern as favored terrain is genius.

3073
03:30:04,992 --> 03:30:07,149
MARISHA: That actually is genius.

3074
03:30:07,149 --> 03:30:09,708
LAURA: You can have urban settings as your favored
terrain.

3075
03:30:09,758 --> 03:30:11,359
MARISHA: Yeah, you can have urban settings.

3076
03:30:11,359 --> 03:30:13,092
MATT: Nope! It just means that for your
intelligence and wisdom checks related to the

3077
03:30:13,092 --> 03:30:19,017
terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled. So
technically, not even advantage, but it's worked

3078
03:30:19,017 --> 03:30:22,842
out fine. So no, you do not get advantage for
that. What did you roll?

3079
03:30:22,842 --> 03:30:24,561
LAURA: Ten for initiative.

3080
03:30:24,561 --> 03:30:26,104
MATT: Total initiative of ten?

3081
03:30:26,104 --> 03:30:27,543
LAURA: I know, okay, Matthew?

3082
03:30:27,543 --> 03:30:30,133
LIAM: That is just under average.

3083
03:30:30,133 --> 03:30:32,805
MATT: It is now the creature's turn.

3084
03:30:32,805 --> 03:30:38,895
LAURA: Great. That's not a good thing.

3085
03:30:38,895 --> 03:30:51,945
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. It comes
rushing up to you, swings one of its fists towards

3086
03:30:52,016 --> 03:30:58,591
you. It comes back as a fist and the claws open
right as it comes in your direction. First attack,

3087
03:30:58,591 --> 03:31:01,099
that is a 24 to hit.

3088
03:31:01,099 --> 03:31:02,504
LAURA: That hits me.

3089
03:31:02,504 --> 03:31:12,713
MATT: All righty, you suffer from the first claw
strike 17 points of slashing damage. As soon as

3090
03:31:12,713 --> 03:31:18,711
that claw strike comes by, it brings its second
claw upward in an uppercut arc. That is going to

3091
03:31:18,711 --> 03:31:20,661
be a natural 20.

3092
03:31:20,661 --> 03:31:22,021
TRAVIS: Ooh!

3093
03:31:22,021 --> 03:31:23,549
ASHLEY: Come on!

3094
03:31:23,549 --> 03:31:34,213
MATT: That is 28 points of slashing damage, and
then it's going to attempt to bite you. You watch

3095
03:31:34,213 --> 03:31:42,383
now this snub crocodile-like jaw unhinges and
opens up with these natural spiked teeth on the

3096
03:31:42,383 --> 03:31:49,091
top and bottom sides. It's going to reach out
towards you. That is a 15.

3097
03:31:49,091 --> 03:31:51,752
LAURA: That doesn't hit me.

3098
03:31:51,752 --> 03:31:55,513
MATT: It goes to bite towards you, and after the
first strikes hit you, you duck out of the way and

3099
03:31:55,513 --> 03:32:00,543
you hear him snatch together over top, making a
horrible clenching noise, but you are not in the

3100
03:32:00,543 --> 03:32:06,682
jaws when they close. As you look up as you duck
down, it pulls back and (snorts) in a "what have

3101
03:32:06,682 --> 03:32:09,248
you got?"-type expression. What are you doing?

3102
03:32:09,248 --> 03:32:12,384
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to pop Trinket out.

3103
03:32:12,384 --> 03:32:14,750
MATT: Okay, where?

3104
03:32:14,750 --> 03:32:16,546
LAURA: Behind him.

3105
03:32:16,546 --> 03:32:24,273
MATT: You watch this tiny arc of black energy arc
over and you swear you see two of the eyes, even

3106
03:32:24,273 --> 03:32:28,066
though there is no visible iris, follow the
immediate motion as the rest stay focused on you,

3107
03:32:28,066 --> 03:32:31,381
and then Trinket appears behind it. (roars)

3108
03:32:31,381 --> 03:32:33,776
LAURA: I'm going to disengage.

3109
03:32:33,776 --> 03:32:35,673
MATT: Okay, as your bonus.

3110
03:32:35,673 --> 03:32:39,029
LAURA: And bamf up into the sky on my broom.

3111
03:32:39,029 --> 03:32:41,934
MATT: All righty. How high up are you going? Full
movement?

3112
03:32:41,934 --> 03:32:44,520
LAURA: What is that, 30?

3113
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:45,915
MATT: That is 30, yes.

3114
03:32:45,915 --> 03:32:54,900
LAURA: Yeah, but I want to get up to a tree that's
far away from him. I don't want to hang out on the

3115
03:32:54,900 --> 03:33:00,141
broom, I just want to be high enough that he can't
jump up to me right away. You know what I mean?

3116
03:33:00,141 --> 03:33:01,711
MATT: Yep, so you are right up there.

3117
03:33:01,711 --> 03:33:07,351
LAURA: Okay, and then I want to brace myself in a
tree, so if I fell off the broom I wouldn't fall

3118
03:33:07,351 --> 03:33:08,526
onto the ground.

3119
03:33:08,526 --> 03:33:12,520
MATT: So full movement would be about 20 feet up
and ten feet back?

3120
03:33:12,520 --> 03:33:13,797
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

3121
03:33:13,797 --> 03:33:17,871
MATT: Okay, so you would be about there, and you
would be a little bit lower. We'll say for the

3122
03:33:17,871 --> 03:33:28,907
purposes of this, because that direction does
matter. All right, so you're back over here. Got

3123
03:33:28,907 --> 03:33:36,563
it. Right up against this tree. That's your bonus
action, that's your movement, what else are you

3124
03:33:36,563 --> 03:33:37,451
doing?

3125
03:33:37,451 --> 03:33:41,305
LAURA: Yes. He can jump really far, I know.

3126
03:33:41,305 --> 03:33:42,508
LIAM: Up. Go up.

3127
03:33:42,508 --> 03:33:49,513
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him.

3128
03:33:49,513 --> 03:33:50,890
MATT: Okay.

3129
03:33:50,890 --> 03:33:59,297
LAURA: Twice. But through my Blazing Bowstring.

3130
03:33:59,367 --> 03:34:00,806
MATT: Okay.

3131
03:34:00,806 --> 03:34:10,552
LAURA: Okay, 25 for the first.

3132
03:34:10,552 --> 03:34:11,921
MATT: That hits.

3133
03:34:11,921 --> 03:34:24,532
LAURA: Awesome! That's five plus eight is 13, plus
four for Hunter's Mark, plus three for Sneak

3134
03:34:24,532 --> 03:34:29,312
Attack, plus four lightning damage.

3135
03:34:29,312 --> 03:34:31,722
MATT: (laughs) 24 damage.

3136
03:34:31,722 --> 03:34:37,258
LAURA: Plus two for the bracers, so 26 damage. Oh,
wait! Plus the Blazing Bowstring, which is another

3137
03:34:37,258 --> 03:34:39,531
seven! That's fire damage.

3138
03:34:39,531 --> 03:34:41,230
LIAM: Your Hunter's Mark is in there already?

3139
03:34:41,230 --> 03:34:48,559
LAURA: My Hunter's Mark is in there. And then I'm
going to try to do it again. I'm going to try to

3140
03:34:48,559 --> 03:34:55,497
do the same thing again. That's fucking cocked.
28.

3141
03:34:55,497 --> 03:34:57,550
MATT: 28 does hit.

3142
03:34:57,550 --> 03:35:13,999
LAURA: 18 for the arrow, plus three lightning
damage, plus six for the Hunter's Mark, and I

3143
03:35:13,999 --> 03:35:15,790
don't get another Sneak Attack.

3144
03:35:15,790 --> 03:35:17,357
MATT: No, just once per round.

3145
03:35:17,357 --> 03:35:21,604
LAURA: And the Blazing Bowstring is another
seven.

3146
03:35:21,604 --> 03:35:24,014
SAM: 67 total damage.

3147
03:35:24,014 --> 03:35:25,463
LAURA: That's not fucking bad.

3148
03:35:25,463 --> 03:35:27,169
MATT: No, that's not bad at all.

3149
03:35:27,169 --> 03:35:29,865
LIAM: I'm sure the thing is on the verge of
death.

3150
03:35:29,865 --> 03:35:35,417
MATT: So that ends your turn? You've used all your
actions.

3151
03:35:35,417 --> 03:35:40,945
LAURA: All I'm going to do is go, you know, you
seem like a nice guy. I hate to kill you.

3152
03:35:40,945 --> 03:35:43,145
(laughter)

3153
03:35:43,145 --> 03:35:47,222
SAM: "I don't speak English."

3154
03:35:47,222 --> 03:35:59,063
MATT: The creature glances over at Trinket behind,
looks up at you in the tree and in a creepily

3155
03:35:59,063 --> 03:36:04,161
humanoid way, wipes the edge of its jaw and then
leaps off this tree.

3156
03:36:04,161 --> 03:36:05,938
LAURA: Trinket gets a swipe at him.

3157
03:36:05,938 --> 03:36:13,874
MATT: Yes, he does. And then it leaps in your
direction in the sky. (impact, roar) Arms out, jaw

3158
03:36:13,874 --> 03:36:16,064
open. Make the attack for Trinket.

3159
03:36:16,064 --> 03:36:23,342
LAURA: I think he likes me, y'all. What is it, a
bite attack or a claw attack? Does it matter?

3160
03:36:23,342 --> 03:36:24,825
MATT: Whichever one you want.

3161
03:36:24,825 --> 03:36:30,973
LAURA: A bite attack, then. That is 12 plus nine.
21.

3162
03:36:30,973 --> 03:36:33,636
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage for
Trinket.

3163
03:36:33,636 --> 03:36:36,922
LAURA: Where's my d6?

3164
03:36:36,922 --> 03:36:38,503
TRAVIS: That yellow one.

3165
03:36:38,503 --> 03:36:41,303
LAURA: Nine.

3166
03:36:41,303 --> 03:36:46,938
MATT: Nine points of damage for Trinket. Nice. It
leaps into the air, arms out, jaw open towards

3167
03:36:46,938 --> 03:36:51,896
you. It's going to make a bite attack towards you.
That is a 23 to hit.

3168
03:36:51,896 --> 03:36:53,803
LAURA: That hits me, motherfucker.

3169
03:36:53,803 --> 03:37:07,758
MATT: All righty. You suffer 19 points of piercing
damage, and I need you to make an athletics or

3170
03:37:07,758 --> 03:37:09,084
acrobatics check.

3171
03:37:09,084 --> 03:37:15,845
LAURA: That's great. That is a 34.

3172
03:37:15,845 --> 03:37:23,170
MATT: 34. The jaw attempts to pull you from the
broom. The strength of its grasp on you is

3173
03:37:23,170 --> 03:37:31,328
extremely heavy. You sense that this is a grapple
rend technique that it has. However, you manage to

3174
03:37:31,328 --> 03:37:38,009
squeeze out of its teeth and elbow it as you push
it off with your foot, releasing the grasp. You

3175
03:37:38,009 --> 03:37:43,254
are not grappled by the creature. However, on its
way down, it's going to swing out with its claws as

3176
03:37:43,254 --> 03:37:48,795
you push it off. That's a natural one. Two natural
ones in a row!

3177
03:37:48,795 --> 03:37:50,876
(cheering)

3178
03:37:50,876 --> 03:37:53,176
LAURA: And he falls to the ground and he hurts
himself.

3179
03:37:53,176 --> 03:37:54,356
ASHLEY: And dies.

3180
03:37:54,356 --> 03:37:55,493
MATT: He definitely plummets.

3181
03:37:55,493 --> 03:37:57,288
SAM: Oh god, a tree falls.

3182
03:37:57,288 --> 03:38:05,197
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, sure.
As he lands under the tree, the tree slams down,

3183
03:38:05,197 --> 03:38:12,686
and as he hits the ground and slams, you can see
the dirt has been displaced from impact. This

3184
03:38:12,686 --> 03:38:17,786
creature is extremely heavy and dense, now seeing
it right in front of your face, to the point where

3185
03:38:17,786 --> 03:38:22,372
its tumbling impact pushed a tree over in the
middle of the forest. That's the end of its turn.

3186
03:38:22,372 --> 03:38:23,524
You're up.

3187
03:38:23,524 --> 03:38:24,761
LAURA: Okay.

3188
03:38:24,761 --> 03:38:25,831
TRAVIS: Two ones in a row.

3189
03:38:25,831 --> 03:38:26,940
MATT: Two ones in a fucking row!

3190
03:38:26,940 --> 03:38:28,796
TRAVIS: No dice jail for that one?

3191
03:38:28,796 --> 03:38:33,732
MATT: No, this is my go-to die. This is the
fan-given die. I use this for everything.

3192
03:38:33,732 --> 03:38:41,116
LAURA: I'm going to do something. This is all
fucking concentration, so I can't do shit. I'm

3193
03:38:41,116 --> 03:38:46,919
going to go up higher.

3194
03:38:46,919 --> 03:38:48,453
MATT: Okay.

3195
03:38:48,453 --> 03:38:51,519
LAURA: I'm going to hope that I'm going out of his
range.

3196
03:38:51,519 --> 03:38:52,657
MATT: You're going full up?

3197
03:38:52,657 --> 03:38:53,707
LAURA: Yeah.

3198
03:38:53,707 --> 03:38:58,867
MATT: All right, we'll say you're going 30 feet up
from where you were. You're up in this direction

3199
03:38:58,867 --> 03:39:00,428
there.

3200
03:39:00,428 --> 03:39:12,890
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to shoot him. (laughs)
I'm going to shoot him twice! 19?

3201
03:39:12,890 --> 03:39:15,227
MATT: 19 does hit, yes.

3202
03:39:15,227 --> 03:39:31,997
LAURA: Yes! Okay, that's 16 plus two lightning
damage, plus one for Hunter's Mark. But I do get

3203
03:39:31,997 --> 03:39:36,357
Sneak Attack because Trinket's next to him, right?
Well, I run Trinket up to him. How about that? I

3204
03:39:36,357 --> 03:39:40,988
run Trinket up to him. So a six for the Sneak
Attack.

3205
03:39:40,988 --> 03:39:43,095
MATT: Six damage for Sneak Attack. Got it.

3206
03:39:43,095 --> 03:39:44,098
LAURA: Is he prone?

3207
03:39:44,098 --> 03:39:45,057
MATT: Nope.

3208
03:39:45,057 --> 03:39:52,349
LAURA: I'm going to, for my bonus action, have
Trinket attack him with a bite attack before I

3209
03:39:52,349 --> 03:39:54,029
send off my second arrow.

3210
03:39:54,029 --> 03:39:59,076
MATT: Go for it. I need you to roll a
concentration check, by the way, for your Hunter's

3211
03:39:59,076 --> 03:40:02,763
Mark. Because you took damage for each of those
hits. You've got to remember that.

3212
03:40:02,763 --> 03:40:03,874
LAURA: Oh. A 20?

3213
03:40:03,874 --> 03:40:06,626
MATT: So just roll a constitution saving throw.

3214
03:40:06,626 --> 03:40:10,027
LAURA: 12.

3215
03:40:10,027 --> 03:40:18,241
MATT: 12? It would have been-- That's fine for the
first one. Roll again.

3216
03:40:18,296 --> 03:40:20,222
LAURA: That's not 12.

3217
03:40:20,298 --> 03:40:21,288
MATT: What's that one?

3218
03:40:21,363 --> 03:40:22,831
LAURA: That's lower, that's four.

3219
03:40:22,831 --> 03:40:25,226
MATT: Four? Yeah, so Hunter's Mark-- Actually,
that last Hunter's Mark would not have hit.

3220
03:40:25,226 --> 03:40:26,722
LAURA: That's okay, it was just one anyway.

3221
03:40:26,722 --> 03:40:31,576
MATT: Don't forget to remember that. My fault.

3222
03:40:31,576 --> 03:40:34,057
LAURA: Okay. I don't do that very often.

3223
03:40:34,057 --> 03:40:35,750
MATT: I know, it's okay.

3224
03:40:35,750 --> 03:40:41,487
LAURA: Trinket's attack was 24.

3225
03:40:41,487 --> 03:40:42,728
MATT: 24 hits.

3226
03:40:42,728 --> 03:40:46,869
LAURA: Okay. So that's 12 for him.

3227
03:40:46,869 --> 03:40:48,548
MATT: Okay, nice.

3228
03:40:48,548 --> 03:40:51,301
LAURA: And then I'm going to do my second attack.

3229
03:40:51,301 --> 03:40:52,496
MATT: All righty.

3230
03:40:52,496 --> 03:40:57,675
LAURA: And that is 20-something, which hits.

3231
03:40:57,675 --> 03:40:59,013
MATT: That hits, yeah.

3232
03:40:59,013 --> 03:41:06,227
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay! I hope he can't get up
this high! Ten, 11, 12! Plus four lightning

3233
03:41:06,227 --> 03:41:07,400
damage!

3234
03:41:07,400 --> 03:41:08,411
MATT: Nice.

3235
03:41:08,411 --> 03:41:09,755
LAURA: And no Sneak Attack.

3236
03:41:09,755 --> 03:41:13,081
MATT: Nope. So as the arrows (whoosh), they're
sinking into the hide. The hide is very thick, but

3237
03:41:13,081 --> 03:41:20,616
you can see the dark trails of blood just slowly
dripping from each of these wounds where the

3238
03:41:20,616 --> 03:41:24,346
arrows plug the hole, but they're all sticking and
they're all staying in. You just see now this

3239
03:41:24,346 --> 03:41:28,765
pincushion of a chest as each arrow stays,
protruding from the front of this creature, its

3240
03:41:28,765 --> 03:41:35,091
thick gray hide, yellow eyes still glaring at you.
You can see as it looks around, it's glancing in

3241
03:41:35,091 --> 03:41:38,004
the vicinity for what it can do. Ending your
turn?

3242
03:41:38,004 --> 03:41:43,862
LAURA: I say, so I mean, what are you doing out
here? I mean, do you work for Pelor? Is this,

3243
03:41:43,862 --> 03:41:46,239
like, a thing you do all the time?

3244
03:41:46,239 --> 03:41:47,763
SAM: (whispers) Ask her name!

3245
03:41:47,763 --> 03:41:50,357
(laughter)

3246
03:41:50,357 --> 03:41:52,138
LAURA: What's your sign?

3247
03:41:52,138 --> 03:41:55,951
MATT: As you're saying this, you watch the
creature. Trinket's hassling it from the back, it

3248
03:41:55,951 --> 03:42:04,669
pushes off, looks over, grabs the tree that just
fell and picks it up and throws it in your

3249
03:42:04,669 --> 03:42:13,463
direction. Which, it makes a strength check to do
so. That is a 21 to hit.

3250
03:42:13,463 --> 03:42:14,501
MARISHA: Oh no!

3251
03:42:14,501 --> 03:42:16,249
LIAM: Oh, son of a Gern!

3252
03:42:16,249 --> 03:42:18,389
LAURA: It hits.

3253
03:42:18,389 --> 03:42:19,587
MATT: Okay.

3254
03:42:19,587 --> 03:42:20,801
TRAVIS: You went up higher!

3255
03:42:20,801 --> 03:42:23,909
LAURA: I know, I'm going to die, I'm going to fall
and die if I get knocked off this fucking broom.

3256
03:42:23,909 --> 03:42:27,215
MARISHA: You're like those Weather Fail videos,
you got hit by a tree!

3257
03:42:27,215 --> 03:42:29,444
LIAM: (sings) My sister in the woods--

3258
03:42:29,444 --> 03:42:33,586
MATT: Okay, you take 17 points of bludgeoning
damage. As the tree strikes you--

3259
03:42:33,586 --> 03:42:38,047
SAM: Nightmare on Elm Street.

3260
03:42:38,047 --> 03:42:39,946
LIAM: You're okay.

3261
03:42:39,946 --> 03:42:41,306
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3262
03:42:41,306 --> 03:42:43,047
MATT: I need you to go ahead and-- let's see--

3263
03:42:43,047 --> 03:42:46,099
LAURA: I should have had a Feast or something
before. I should have talked to you, and had you

3264
03:42:46,099 --> 03:42:52,236
inspire me. Yeah, I should've thought about those
things. I was really excited about going and

3265
03:42:52,236 --> 03:42:53,452
hunting things.

3266
03:42:53,452 --> 03:42:55,672
MATT: Yeah, well, now you know. So as the tree
impacts you, it's threatening to knock you off the

3267
03:42:55,672 --> 03:43:02,825
broom. Even though it'll remain attached to you,
it's a tumble. I need you to go ahead and-- Oh

3268
03:43:02,825 --> 03:43:10,454
man, this'll be an interesting DC. Make a strength
check to hold yourself on the broom.

3269
03:43:10,454 --> 03:43:11,517
LAURA: Strength check?

3270
03:43:11,517 --> 03:43:14,201
MATT: Yeah, this is to see if from the impact you
can still hold on to the broom or be knocked from

3271
03:43:14,201 --> 03:43:16,718
it. Or a strength saving throw, is what it would
be.

3272
03:43:16,718 --> 03:43:20,592
LIAM: Natural 20. Roll now. Do it right now.
That's not a 20.

3273
03:43:20,592 --> 03:43:22,392
LAURA: That's not a 20, that's a ten.

3274
03:43:22,392 --> 03:43:27,499
MATT: That's a ten. You are thrown from the broom
from the impact, and immediately tumble--

3275
03:43:27,499 --> 03:43:29,468
LAURA: To the tree!

3276
03:43:29,468 --> 03:43:32,957
MATT: -- the tree that fell.

3277
03:43:32,957 --> 03:43:36,499
LAURA: To another tree! Because it hit me and it
kind of changed the trajectory.

3278
03:43:36,499 --> 03:43:40,151
MATT: Okay, so you hit a series of branches on the
way down.

3279
03:43:40,151 --> 03:43:47,659
LAURA: Trinket sees it happening and he runs over
and he saves me and everything's fine and I am

3280
03:43:47,659 --> 03:43:49,244
still the Grand Mistress.

3281
03:43:49,244 --> 03:43:53,052
MATT: So as you plummet, the broom, as you're not
on it to gun it, it goes limp, and you just tumble

3282
03:43:53,052 --> 03:43:55,655
as it's currently dangling from the chain that's
attached to you.

3283
03:43:55,655 --> 03:43:57,480
LAURA: Can I grab it as I'm falling?

3284
03:43:57,480 --> 03:43:58,778
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

3285
03:43:58,778 --> 03:44:00,108
LIAM: Character development!

3286
03:44:00,108 --> 03:44:08,023
MATT: You land prone on the ground and suffer 15
points of bludgeoning damage.

3287
03:44:08,023 --> 03:44:09,527
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

3288
03:44:09,527 --> 03:44:15,168
LIAM: You gotta potion? Fucking down a potion,
man! Do it!

3289
03:44:15,237 --> 03:44:16,698
MARISHA: She can heal herself on a good day.

3290
03:44:16,698 --> 03:44:17,719
SAM: She better now!

3291
03:44:17,719 --> 03:44:19,568
MATT: It takes a step forward. Trinket does get an
attack of opportunity.

3292
03:44:19,568 --> 03:44:22,260
LAURA: It gets to attack again even though it
threw something?

3293
03:44:22,260 --> 03:44:23,941
MATT: No, it just moves up to you.

3294
03:44:23,941 --> 03:44:24,932
LAURA: Jesus.

3295
03:44:24,932 --> 03:44:27,929
MATT: It's now looming over you, threatening. That
was its full action, was throwing the tree.

3296
03:44:27,929 --> 03:44:30,070
LAURA: Trinket got a natural 20!

3297
03:44:30,070 --> 03:44:32,037
(cheering)

3298
03:44:32,037 --> 03:44:37,811
LAURA: Oh my god, and you know
what I just remembered? It doesn't matter, he gets

3299
03:44:37,970 --> 03:44:40,110
a crit on 19s before and he got a 19.

3300
03:44:40,110 --> 03:44:41,643
MATT: Well, now you know.

3301
03:44:41,643 --> 03:44:42,831
LIAM: Triple the dice.

3302
03:44:42,831 --> 03:44:47,998
LAURA: Okay, so that's a bite attack. Triple the
dice?

3303
03:44:47,998 --> 03:44:49,488
MATT: No, he's just fucking with you.

3304
03:44:49,488 --> 03:44:51,459
LAURA: Damn it, I was real excited.

3305
03:44:51,459 --> 03:44:52,484
LIAM: It's really quadruple.

3306
03:44:52,484 --> 03:44:54,825
LAURA: 16. Ooh.

3307
03:44:54,825 --> 03:44:56,038
MATT: 16, nice.

3308
03:44:56,038 --> 03:44:57,574
MARISHA: But that doubled?

3309
03:44:57,574 --> 03:44:58,656
LAURA: Yeah, that's doubled.

3310
03:44:58,656 --> 03:44:59,919
MARISHA: Oh, that was doubled? Okay.

3311
03:44:59,919 --> 03:45:01,186
LAURA: He's biting! It's a bite!

3312
03:45:01,186 --> 03:45:02,440
MATT: Look, it's awesome!

3313
03:45:02,440 --> 03:45:03,731
LAURA: He's a bear!

3314
03:45:03,731 --> 03:45:08,994
MATT: So he lashes out and gets a big chunk, you
see Trinket goes (roars) and steps up and is now

3315
03:45:08,994 --> 03:45:10,068
looming over you.

3316
03:45:10,068 --> 03:45:11,375
LAURA: Thanks, buddy!

3317
03:45:11,375 --> 03:45:14,047
MATT: Now in the darkness, as you look up from the
impact, your eyes open, and all you see is this

3318
03:45:14,047 --> 03:45:19,769
outline, the moonlight hitting the back of this
creature, giving the shape, the white line of its

3319
03:45:19,769 --> 03:45:24,832
giant shoulders and muscular chest and the six
glowing eyes staring down at you as it looms.

3320
03:45:24,832 --> 03:45:27,304
(grunts) Your turn.

3321
03:45:27,304 --> 03:45:34,095
LAURA: I say, why are we doing this? Why are we
even fighting? Is this a thing? Is this a thing?

3322
03:45:34,095 --> 03:45:36,273
Should we talk about this?

3323
03:45:36,273 --> 03:45:37,967
MATT: Are you trying to talk to it?

3324
03:45:37,967 --> 03:45:39,076
LAURA: Yeah!

3325
03:45:39,076 --> 03:45:40,496
MATT: What are you--

3326
03:45:40,496 --> 03:45:42,487
LAURA: No, would I use my whole turn to try to
talk to him as I disengage,

3327
03:45:42,487 --> 03:45:43,656
can I try to stand up--

3328
03:45:43,656 --> 03:45:47,344
MATT: If you're making quips, that's fine, but if
you're trying to actually converse with and get

3329
03:45:47,344 --> 03:45:49,566
through to a creature, that'll be your action.

3330
03:45:49,566 --> 03:45:50,452
LAURA: Oh, fuckballs.

3331
03:45:50,452 --> 03:45:51,974
MARISHA: Are you Peter Parkering?

3332
03:45:51,974 --> 03:45:53,221
LAURA: That's a bad idea.

3333
03:45:53,221 --> 03:45:54,883
MATT: What are you doing, Vex'ahlia? Your choice.

3334
03:45:54,883 --> 03:46:01,389
LAURA: I roll out of the way of him, right? 'Cause
he's looming over me, is he within--

3335
03:46:01,389 --> 03:46:03,657
MATT: He is looming over you. You are prone on the
ground next to him. So you can--

3336
03:46:03,657 --> 03:46:04,851
LAURA: Can I disengage out of this?

3337
03:46:04,851 --> 03:46:07,103
MATT: So you disengage as a bonus action, and you
can move three squares away.

3338
03:46:07,103 --> 03:46:08,506
LAURA: Great, cool!

3339
03:46:08,506 --> 03:46:10,684
MATT: So you get up, there you go.

3340
03:46:10,684 --> 03:46:14,581
LAURA: How the fuck? What the fuck am I going to
do?

3341
03:46:14,581 --> 03:46:16,501
TRAVIS: Kobayashi Maru, you got this.

3342
03:46:16,501 --> 03:46:18,529
MATT: You have your action, still. What do you
do?

3343
03:46:18,529 --> 03:46:22,603
LAURA: I'm going to-- I mean-- I already used a
bonus action to disengage, so I can't take a

3344
03:46:22,603 --> 03:46:23,879
healing potion.

3345
03:46:23,879 --> 03:46:24,817
MATT: Correct.

3346
03:46:24,817 --> 03:46:26,527
LIAM: You got your broom still, or is the broom--

3347
03:46:26,527 --> 03:46:28,876
LAURA: The broom is attached, it's dragging behind
me.

3348
03:46:28,876 --> 03:46:31,640
MATT: It's dragging behind her by the ankle, 
it's like (shuffling noise).

3349
03:46:31,695 --> 03:46:35,597
LIAM: Action plus movement, you can double
movement away, up in the air. Away from this

3350
03:46:35,597 --> 03:46:36,673
motherfucker.

3351
03:46:36,673 --> 03:46:37,950
SAM: Or you can use your action to heal.

3352
03:46:37,950 --> 03:46:39,196
LAURA: Yeah, but then he'll just attack me again!

3353
03:46:39,196 --> 03:46:40,375
LIAM: How high can you go?

3354
03:46:40,375 --> 03:46:41,472
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him.

3355
03:46:41,472 --> 03:46:42,336
MATT: Okay.

3356
03:46:42,336 --> 03:46:43,792
LAURA: I'm going to commit.

3357
03:46:43,792 --> 03:46:44,785
MATT: Okay.

3358
03:46:44,785 --> 03:46:46,903
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him twice as I'm staring
at him.

3359
03:46:46,957 --> 03:46:48,464
MATT: Okay.

3360
03:46:48,639 --> 03:46:52,748
LAURA: Say this is-- This is not the kind of Hunt
that I am used to! And I try to shoot him.

3361
03:46:52,748 --> 03:46:56,410
SAM: Can you do anything to knock him prone or
anything?

3362
03:46:56,410 --> 03:47:00,822
LAURA: I mean, I guess I don't have any kind of
concentration up anymore because I got fucking

3363
03:47:00,822 --> 03:47:02,326
destroyed.

3364
03:47:02,326 --> 03:47:03,617
MATT: Correct.

3365
03:47:03,617 --> 03:47:08,059
LIAM: You have destroyed dragons, tree men,
hearts...

3366
03:47:08,128 --> 03:47:11,212
LAURA: These are all bonus, though. Really, I
can't do shit. I kind of suck.

3367
03:47:11,212 --> 03:47:13,391
SAM: Fenthras? Can't Fenthras do something?

3368
03:47:13,391 --> 03:47:16,343
LAURA: Fenthras can do Bramble Shot, which I
already did. 17?

3369
03:47:16,343 --> 03:47:18,859
MATT: 17 just barely hits.

3370
03:47:18,859 --> 03:47:20,241
ALL: Ooh!

3371
03:47:20,241 --> 03:47:21,382
LAURA: Misses or hits?

3372
03:47:21,382 --> 03:47:22,397
MATT: Hits.

3373
03:47:22,397 --> 03:47:38,432
LAURA: Okay. 11, 12. 12 plus one lightning damage.
Trinket ran up as I was saying that! Plus two

3374
03:47:38,432 --> 03:47:39,492
Sneak Attack.

3375
03:47:39,492 --> 03:47:40,458
MATT: Okay.

3376
03:47:40,458 --> 03:47:42,989
LAURA: Trinket's going to run up and take his
swipe while I'm doing this.

3377
03:47:42,989 --> 03:47:44,214
MATT: Go for it.

3378
03:47:44,214 --> 03:47:46,545
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I used my bonus action to
disengage. Trinket can't do that.

3379
03:47:46,545 --> 03:47:48,440
MATT: Correct, yeah. So you only get your two
attacks.

3380
03:47:48,440 --> 03:47:52,604
LAURA: Great, okay. 29.

3381
03:47:52,604 --> 03:47:54,154
MATT: 29 hits.

3382
03:47:54,154 --> 03:48:03,920
LAURA: This is bad, this is bad, this is bad,
guys. This is super bad. 14, 15, 16, oh, that

3383
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:09,243
doesn't count, 16, plus two lightning damage.

3384
03:48:09,243 --> 03:48:14,895
MATT: So 18? 18 points of damage. All right. You
watch as all these arrows (whoosh) sink into his

3385
03:48:14,895 --> 03:48:19,763
body, its abdomen, its knee, one of the knees kind
of buckles a little bit, it's like (grunts) you

3386
03:48:19,763 --> 03:48:25,766
can see now it's visibly hurt, it's bleeding from
a lot of places and as it stands back up, its knee

3387
03:48:25,766 --> 03:48:30,955
shakes from the impact, and as its knee locks into
place the arrow that you just shot snaps from the

3388
03:48:30,955 --> 03:48:32,819
hide clicking together.

3389
03:48:32,819 --> 03:48:37,378
LAURA: I'm just going to put my arms down and
stare at him.

3390
03:48:37,378 --> 03:48:40,823
MATT: And you stare at it as it just looms towards
you, and as it gets, stepping up to you now, your

3391
03:48:40,823 --> 03:48:47,989
standing position, it's a good four feet taller
than you. Trinket gets another attack of

3392
03:48:47,989 --> 03:48:51,021
opportunity as it moves towards you, not even
focusing on your companion.

3393
03:48:51,021 --> 03:48:54,334
SAM: Double crit!

3394
03:48:54,334 --> 03:48:56,867
LAURA: 16.

3395
03:48:56,867 --> 03:49:01,084
MATT: 16 just misses. Trinket swipes and hits the
back but just skids off the hide leaving these

3396
03:49:01,084 --> 03:49:03,242
scratch marks but no real damage.

3397
03:49:03,242 --> 03:49:04,476
LAURA: Fuck.

3398
03:49:04,476 --> 03:49:09,409
MATT: As it looms forward, it's going to go ahead
and take its multi-attack on you. It just looks at

3399
03:49:09,409 --> 03:49:15,033
you and it goes (cracks) and you hear its knuckles
crack, these thick (cracks) as it brings its fists

3400
03:49:15,033 --> 03:49:26,319
into giant angry punches and swings the first claw
towards you. That is a four plus nine, 13. Misses

3401
03:49:26,319 --> 03:49:32,802
you. Cocked. That is an eight plus nine, that is
17.

3402
03:49:32,802 --> 03:49:33,983
LAURA: Doesn't hit!

3403
03:49:33,983 --> 03:49:35,114
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3404
03:49:35,114 --> 03:49:38,749
MATT: The bite attack, that is 27.

3405
03:49:38,749 --> 03:49:45,278
LAURA: That definitely hits. Dodge, dodge, dodge,
ugh!

3406
03:49:45,278 --> 03:49:47,619
SAM: I can't watch, I can't watch.

3407
03:49:47,619 --> 03:49:48,832
LIAM: You have Uncanny Dodge yet?

3408
03:49:48,832 --> 03:49:52,468
LAURA: I don't have Uncanny Dodge yet, that's
level five or seven or something.

3409
03:49:52,468 --> 03:49:56,632
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage.

3410
03:49:56,632 --> 03:49:57,755
SAM: (yells) Oh!

3411
03:49:57,755 --> 03:49:59,348
LAURA: I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.

3412
03:49:59,348 --> 03:50:00,474
SAM: Wait, is that true?

3413
03:50:00,474 --> 03:50:01,506
LIAM: Yeah, she's alive.

3414
03:50:01,506 --> 03:50:04,799
MATT: I need you to make another athletics or
acrobatics check, as its jaws are now clamping

3415
03:50:04,799 --> 03:50:06,216
onto you, attempting to grapple you.

3416
03:50:06,216 --> 03:50:09,819
LAURA: Oh, it's trying to grapple me? 18.

3417
03:50:09,819 --> 03:50:11,512
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

3418
03:50:11,512 --> 03:50:12,871
MATT: 18? 14, yeah.

3419
03:50:12,871 --> 03:50:15,027
(cheering)

3420
03:50:15,027 --> 03:50:17,593
MATT: Fucking this guy cannot roll for shit when
it counts-- okay.

3421
03:50:17,593 --> 03:50:19,300
LAURA: It's okay, neither can I!

3422
03:50:19,484 --> 03:50:24,108
MATT: There you go! So the jaws clamp on you, and
you just muscle and squeeze out. You can feel the

3423
03:50:24,108 --> 03:50:29,123
teeth tear against your flesh between the bits of
your leather armor. As you pull away, the armor

3424
03:50:29,123 --> 03:50:33,775
snaps open on its hinges and you now have your
bloodied shoulder exposed in the moonlight right

3425
03:50:33,775 --> 03:50:42,053
now in the canopy. As it's there, you're heaving,
it's kind of heaving, staring you down. What are

3426
03:50:42,217 --> 03:50:43,717
you going to do? It's your turn.

3427
03:50:43,717 --> 03:50:51,659
LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket run up and I'm
going to, fuckin' A, have to disengage, and run

3428
03:50:51,659 --> 03:51:00,252
the fuck away, 'cause that's all I can do. I'm
going to disengage and run as far towards that

3429
03:51:00,252 --> 03:51:01,802
tree circle as I can.

3430
03:51:01,802 --> 03:51:06,302
MATT: As you move, with disengage, you can go
around.

3431
03:51:06,302 --> 03:51:07,776
LAURA: Okay.

3432
03:51:07,776 --> 03:51:10,205
MATT: That's where you can get, right there.

3433
03:51:10,205 --> 03:51:15,281
LAURA: Yeah. So I want Trinket in front of me, and
then I'm going to take two more shots at him.

3434
03:51:15,281 --> 03:51:16,577
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3435
03:51:16,577 --> 03:51:18,626
LIAM: This is it, this is it, do or die.

3436
03:51:18,626 --> 03:51:27,423
LAURA: I know, I'm going to die if I don't do
this! Okay, that hits, that hits, that's 28.

3437
03:51:27,423 --> 03:51:29,103
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll damage.

3438
03:51:29,103 --> 03:51:40,889
LAURA: Okay, okay. 12, 13, 14... 14, 15, 16, two
for lightning damage, and then six for the Sneak

3439
03:51:40,956 --> 03:51:41,936
Attack.

3440
03:51:41,936 --> 03:51:43,214
MATT: All right, nice, nice.

3441
03:51:43,214 --> 03:51:44,623
How do you want to do this?

3442
03:51:44,623 --> 03:51:46,397
(cheering)

3443
03:51:46,397 --> 03:51:52,347
MATT: So the creature is wounded, it's breathing
heavy, it's standing there, and as you rush past,

3444
03:51:52,347 --> 03:51:57,113
it turns around and stands tall again, looking
back at you. As you have the arrow in your sights

3445
03:51:57,113 --> 03:51:59,659
and you release it, the arrow is-- What do you
want to do?

3446
03:51:59,659 --> 03:52:03,290
LAURA: I don't want it to be fatal.

3447
03:52:03,290 --> 03:52:08,703
MATT: Oh, okay. So what are you doing with the
arrow, then?

3448
03:52:08,871 --> 03:52:10,456
LIAM: Hit 'em with the feather end?

3449
03:52:10,456 --> 03:52:11,877
LAURA: Just the feather end.

3450
03:52:11,877 --> 03:52:13,045
(laughter)

3451
03:52:13,045 --> 03:52:14,180
TALIESIN: Tickle, tickle, tickle.

3452
03:52:14,180 --> 03:52:15,502
ASHLEY: Boop! Boop him on the nose.

3453
03:52:15,502 --> 03:52:17,650
LAURA: I want to get him in the shoulder, up
here.

3454
03:52:17,650 --> 03:52:22,723
MATT: Okay. So the arrow (whizz) as you release
it, it hits right below where a clavicle would be

3455
03:52:22,723 --> 03:52:27,279
and it sinks in deep. It goes in probably a good
five, six-- Deeper than any other arrow that

3456
03:52:27,279 --> 03:52:30,745
you've hit it with has done. And it sinks, and you
can see it stops with the feathers at the chest,

3457
03:52:30,807 --> 03:52:36,260
and it gives out a (retches) and falls back to its
one knee that it was on, falls onto its second

3458
03:52:36,260 --> 03:52:40,518
knee, and its arms lean forward, barely keeping
itself up, like a gorilla.

3459
03:52:40,584 --> 03:52:45,937
It's just (heavy breathing).

3460
03:52:45,937 --> 03:52:50,960
LAURA: Trinket is standing right in front of him,
eyeing him down. And I say, you're a noble

3461
03:52:50,960 --> 03:52:55,216
creature, sent here for a reason. Yes?

3462
03:52:55,216 --> 03:53:00,779
MATT: There's very little response, it's just
standing there looking at you. You can see the

3463
03:53:00,779 --> 03:53:05,878
eyes are focused on you even through the slight
glimmers of yellow, even though some of them are

3464
03:53:05,878 --> 03:53:12,314
lulling and blinking. Its muscles are tensing and
relaxing as it's just taking all of its strength

3465
03:53:12,314 --> 03:53:16,815
to stay partially standing at this moment, but
it's listening.

3466
03:53:16,815 --> 03:53:28,304
LAURA: You can leave. You can go back to where you
came from. I protect this forest now. This is

3467
03:53:28,304 --> 03:53:30,553
mine.

3468
03:53:30,553 --> 03:53:39,601
MATT: Make just a straight charisma roll. Just
adding your charisma modifier.

3469
03:53:39,601 --> 03:53:43,021
LAURA: I'm scared of all of my dice right now! Oh
god.

3470
03:53:43,021 --> 03:53:44,776
SAM: Use Liam's!

3471
03:53:44,776 --> 03:53:53,215
LAURA: I know, right? Straight charisma. Seven?

3472
03:53:53,215 --> 03:53:54,886
MATT: Seven?

3473
03:53:54,886 --> 03:54:01,291
LAURA: I know, right? It's not a saving throw,
it's just a check.

3474
03:54:01,291 --> 03:54:02,815
MATT: It's just a check, yeah.

3475
03:54:02,815 --> 03:54:05,747
LAURA: I'm going to throw up.

3476
03:54:05,747 --> 03:54:17,838
MATT: It stands up. It almost falls again on its
knee, grasps, and puts its arm over where the last

3477
03:54:17,838 --> 03:54:27,458
arrow went in. It turns around, and leaps back
into the forest.

3478
03:54:27,458 --> 03:54:32,614
LAURA: It can leap? No! It leaves? I take the
final arrow before it gets away.

3479
03:54:32,614 --> 03:54:38,632
MATT: Okay, go ahead and fire.

3480
03:54:38,632 --> 03:54:39,761
LAURA: 18.

3481
03:54:39,761 --> 03:54:41,520
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3482
03:54:41,520 --> 03:54:51,482
LAURA: I'm going to throw up. Sorry this is so
late, guys. 15, 16, 17, plus two lightning

3483
03:54:51,536 --> 03:54:52,828
damage.

3484
03:54:52,828 --> 03:54:56,783
MATT: As it leaps in the air, you barely see the
shadow disappearing into the canopy. You take your

3485
03:54:56,783 --> 03:54:58,807
final arrow and let loose.

3486
03:54:58,807 --> 03:55:00,971
How do you want to do this?

3487
03:55:00,971 --> 03:55:03,978
LAURA: Just right between the shoulder blades.

3488
03:55:03,978 --> 03:55:11,799
MATT: It hits. You think it hit. You don't hear
anything. Quiet. And then the heaviest

3489
03:55:11,799 --> 03:55:19,248
boulder-like impact of its body onto the forest
ground, skidding into the mud, hitting another

3490
03:55:19,248 --> 03:55:26,285
tree. That tree falls on top, and you have to
dodge onto the side to make sure that nothing else

3491
03:55:26,285 --> 03:55:32,352
falls in the area. And then stillness and calm and
quiet hits, and the cold finally comes in. As the

3492
03:55:32,352 --> 03:55:36,462
blood is pumping and the adrenaline's hitting you,
you felt so warm and you're sweating, and at that

3493
03:55:36,462 --> 03:55:40,780
point as you're breathing in heavily, you can feel
the biting cold of the air hitting your lungs, and

3494
03:55:40,780 --> 03:55:45,377
at that point the adrenaline begins to subside,
and you notice your breath is showing up and it is

3495
03:55:45,377 --> 03:55:48,966
a very cold low mist night now emerging within the
forest.

3496
03:55:48,966 --> 03:55:55,298
LAURA: I walk up and I scratch Trinket on the
head. You did real good there, bud.

3497
03:55:55,298 --> 03:55:57,671
MATT: (bear noises)

3498
03:55:57,671 --> 03:56:01,535
LAURA: We're not dead! And I cast Cure Wounds on
myself.

3499
03:56:01,535 --> 03:56:02,975
MATT: All right.

3500
03:56:02,975 --> 03:56:07,478
LAURA: And then I walk over and try to find a
fucking trophy on this guy.

3501
03:56:07,478 --> 03:56:13,614
MATT: Okay. You walk over and you find, indeed,
the creature is laid out. It is dead. It is cold.

3502
03:56:13,614 --> 03:56:19,874
The arrow sticking out of the back, the final
blow, seems to have hit a very core nerve center

3503
03:56:19,874 --> 03:56:24,380
of its back. So carve whatever trophy you wish
from its body.

3504
03:56:24,380 --> 03:56:31,463
LAURA: I'm just going to cut his hand off. I'm
going to cut his hand off, no biggie.

3505
03:56:31,463 --> 03:56:34,295
MATT: Okay. So you eventually pull out a small
dagger and hack the hand off. It takes you a

3506
03:56:34,295 --> 03:56:37,593
little while but you do manage to get it. The hand
alone probably weighs almost as much as you do.

3507
03:56:37,593 --> 03:56:42,955
LAURA: Jeez! This was maybe the wrong sort of
trophy to grab, okay!

3508
03:56:42,955 --> 03:56:45,279
MATT: Trinket walks over and takes it up in his
jaws.

3509
03:56:45,279 --> 03:56:53,530
LAURA: Wow. You're really strong, did you know
that? And I guess I'm going to-- You don't have to

3510
03:56:53,530 --> 03:56:58,961
carry it just yet, 'cause I want to set fire to
the body and burn it. I'm going to use some of the

3511
03:56:58,961 --> 03:57:03,392
branches from the trees he fucking knocked over to
set a fire around.

3512
03:57:03,392 --> 03:57:07,065
MATT: You do notice that, because this area is
very thickly wooded, setting a fire in the middle

3513
03:57:07,065 --> 03:57:09,016
of the Parchwood Forest, probably not a good
idea.

3514
03:57:09,016 --> 03:57:11,913
LAURA: Well, I'm going to do it in that opening
right there. Look at that. I guess I can't,

3515
03:57:11,913 --> 03:57:13,024
because--

3516
03:57:13,024 --> 03:57:17,849
MATT: You try and tug the creature, and even with
Trinket's help, this thing weighs two tons.

3517
03:57:17,849 --> 03:57:23,818
LAURA: I feel like, as a hunter, I would know how
to set a fire to something without setting fucking

3518
03:57:23,818 --> 03:57:28,051
fire to the trees. I'm good at campfires.

3519
03:57:28,051 --> 03:57:33,694
MATT: Make a wisdom survival check. No advantage
on this one. You would have disadvantage, so it's

3520
03:57:33,694 --> 03:57:34,798
negated.

3521
03:57:34,798 --> 03:57:36,400
SAM: But this is her favored terrain!

3522
03:57:36,400 --> 03:57:37,761
LAURA: Yo! This is survival?

3523
03:57:37,761 --> 03:57:38,484
MATT: Survival.

3524
03:57:38,484 --> 03:57:39,232
LAURA: 18.

3525
03:57:39,232 --> 03:57:44,433
MATT: 18. It takes you the better part of the evening,
but you manage to set a very localized flame

3526
03:57:44,486 --> 03:57:51,367
around this, making sure you have very, very damp
moss and bits of wet mud caked around to make sure

3527
03:57:51,367 --> 03:57:55,748
the flame doesn't spread. Eventually the body does
begin to burn, and by the time you finish and you

3528
03:57:55,748 --> 03:58:02,346
feel successful, you notice the faint glimmer of
morning sun beginning to crest over the mountain.

3529
03:58:02,346 --> 03:58:08,285
LAURA: I bet everyone thinks we're dead. Hey,
Pelor. Pelor? I don't know if I'm saying your name

3530
03:58:08,285 --> 03:58:16,673
wrong. Thanks for that, and I'll be here next time
you send something my way.

3531
03:58:16,673 --> 03:58:27,394
MATT: So, bruised, beaten, you and Trinket find
your way back to Whitestone. You stumble up just

3532
03:58:27,394 --> 03:58:31,104
as everyone's coming everyone's coming to
consciousness. The worrying has kept you up, and

3533
03:58:31,104 --> 03:58:32,125
you've been--

3534
03:58:32,125 --> 03:58:34,383
TALIESIN: I've known, the necklace hasn't gone.

3535
03:58:34,383 --> 03:58:43,162
MATT: No. Eventually, as you guys are getting
breakfast and discussing if anyone had seen you,

3536
03:58:43,162 --> 03:58:50,402
you watch as Vex'ahlia stumbles in, bloodied,
bruised, filthy, and Trinket stumbles in beneath

3537
03:58:50,402 --> 03:58:55,243
and just chucks this giant gray severed hand of a
creature (thuds) onto the ground.

3538
03:58:55,243 --> 03:59:00,017
SAM: And she's great with money, and-- Oh look,
she's back!

3539
03:59:00,017 --> 03:59:07,888
MARISHA: Oh! You look awesome! I mean, you look
like shit, but you look awesome!

3540
03:59:07,888 --> 03:59:10,556
LAURA: Who has a mimosa?

3541
03:59:10,556 --> 03:59:18,193
ASHLEY: We-- all-- here. You look great! That
thing looks so heavy!

3542
03:59:18,193 --> 03:59:20,338
MATT: The staff scatters to make you mimosas.

3543
03:59:20,338 --> 03:59:21,863
LAURA: It's so heavy, I couldn't pick it up!
Trinket had to carry it.

3544
03:59:21,863 --> 03:59:23,016
TRAVIS: What did that belong to?

3545
03:59:23,016 --> 03:59:28,337
LAURA: It was this big weird rhino-y thing with
six eyes. I tried to talk to him, but he just

3546
03:59:28,337 --> 03:59:32,646
didn't want to listen, and I swear, he almost
fucking killed me. I didn't want him to know--

3547
03:59:32,646 --> 03:59:34,235
LIAM: And you handed his ass to him?

3548
03:59:34,235 --> 03:59:37,461
LAURA: I mean, yeah. I set fire to him for you,
bud!

3549
03:59:37,461 --> 03:59:39,777
TALIESIN: Would I know anything with six eyes? Big
rhino thing with six eyes?

3550
03:59:39,777 --> 03:59:40,852
MATT: Sure, you've read around.

3551
03:59:40,852 --> 03:59:42,460
TALIESIN: What am I rolling?

3552
03:59:42,460 --> 03:59:43,845
MATT: This would be a general intelligence check.

3553
03:59:43,845 --> 03:59:46,881
TALIESIN: Just a general intelligence check? 23.

3554
03:59:46,881 --> 03:59:51,860
MATT: 23. As soon as she says that, you're like,
this is a gray render.

3555
03:59:51,860 --> 03:59:55,034
TALIESIN: You killed a gray render.

3556
03:59:55,034 --> 04:00:00,028
LAURA: Wait, I asked you! I asked you before I
left, Do you know of anything that's gray with six

3557
04:00:00,028 --> 04:00:02,498
eyes, and you didn't know, and now you know?

3558
04:00:02,498 --> 04:00:03,795
MATT: Seeing the hand triggered it.

3559
04:00:03,795 --> 04:00:08,445
TALIESIN: There's a surprising number of things
with six eyes, and that's--

3560
04:00:08,445 --> 04:00:11,066
(laughter)

3561
04:00:11,066 --> 04:00:18,310
TALIESIN: That's-- that's interesting.

3562
04:00:18,310 --> 04:00:19,612
MARISHA: Wait.

3563
04:00:19,612 --> 04:00:24,079
LAURA: He was really, really tough to kill, you
guys. If we had been there together, no problem,

3564
04:00:24,079 --> 04:00:25,174
insta-death.

3565
04:00:25,174 --> 04:00:30,272
MATT: What you know of grey renders is, they are
asexual creatures that reproduce only one,

3566
04:00:30,272 --> 04:00:42,141
asexually, per generation. They are territorial
and very protective of their young, and generally

3567
04:00:42,141 --> 04:00:47,463
sometimes bind themselves as a protector of a
certain territory, and given certain

3568
04:00:47,463 --> 04:00:54,093
circumstances, can choose either an individual or
a space to protect as well. But that can depend on

3569
04:00:54,093 --> 04:00:57,268
circumstances, otherwise they can be a dangerous
force of nature.

3570
04:00:57,268 --> 04:01:00,814
LAURA: Wait, does that mean it was a good guy? Did
I kill a good thing?

3571
04:01:00,814 --> 04:01:05,314
TALIESIN: That means it was natural, it didn't
have a good or bad aspect to it.

3572
04:01:05,314 --> 04:01:09,224
LAURA: Does that mean it's got a baby somewhere in
the woods and I just didn't know about it?

3573
04:01:09,224 --> 04:01:17,469
TALIESIN: Maybe, maybe not. That means that you
were sent, and that you did what you thought was

3574
04:01:17,469 --> 04:01:22,699
right. This thing could have been a terrible
danger.

3575
04:01:22,699 --> 04:01:24,158
LAURA: Well, yeah.

3576
04:01:24,158 --> 04:01:28,908
TRAVIS: Don't second-guess yourself! You're alive!
You did good!

3577
04:01:28,908 --> 04:01:30,570
LAURA: No, yeah. Yeah.

3578
04:01:30,570 --> 04:01:36,460
MARISHA: Plus, it's kind of cool that you killed
something called a gray render to become Lady of

3579
04:01:36,460 --> 04:01:38,361
the Grey Hunt.

3580
04:01:38,361 --> 04:01:42,208
LAURA: -- of the Grey Hunt, totally. Hey, that
makes sense.

3581
04:01:42,208 --> 04:01:43,696
TALIESIN: Yes, that is a thing.

3582
04:01:43,696 --> 04:01:45,392
TRAVIS: And you did it by yourself.

3583
04:01:45,392 --> 04:01:55,113
LAURA: Yeah. Imma throw up. No, I'm okay. No I'm
going to throw up. No, I'm good. I'm just going to

3584
04:01:55,113 --> 04:01:56,187
drink my mimosa.

3585
04:01:56,187 --> 04:01:57,618
LIAM: Just keep going.

3586
04:01:57,618 --> 04:02:04,346
LAURA: Okay. I need sleep. It's been a while. I'm
going to go lay down. I love you guys.

3587
04:02:04,346 --> 04:02:05,677
ASHLEY: I love you.

3588
04:02:05,677 --> 04:02:07,142
LAURA: I'm so glad you're here, Pike!

3589
04:02:07,142 --> 04:02:07,981
ASHLEY: Me too.

3590
04:02:07,981 --> 04:02:09,008
SAM: Good night.

3591
04:02:09,008 --> 04:02:10,103
MARISHA: You did it!

3592
04:02:10,103 --> 04:02:11,696
LIAM: I'm going to take my sister to bed.

3593
04:02:11,696 --> 04:02:12,595
LAURA: Thank you.

3594
04:02:12,595 --> 04:02:14,184
TALIESIN: I'm very proud of you.

3595
04:02:14,184 --> 04:02:16,852
SAM: We've all learned things from single moms
today.

3596
04:02:16,852 --> 04:02:20,921
(laughter)

3597
04:02:20,921 --> 04:02:23,552
TALIESIN: Way to bring it all back.

3598
04:02:23,552 --> 04:02:28,171
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Can I have that?

3599
04:02:28,171 --> 04:02:30,077
LAURA: I feel really-- can you--

3600
04:02:30,077 --> 04:02:33,087
TALIESIN: Is there a-- Do they do something with
this trophy, or is that--

3601
04:02:33,087 --> 04:02:40,792
MATT: It is the property of whoever succeeds at
the Grey Hunt, it is their trophy to mount, to

3602
04:02:40,792 --> 04:02:42,971
utilize or discard as they please.

3603
04:02:42,971 --> 04:02:47,179
TRAVIS: I just want to go over and fold all the
fingers back except the middle one.

3604
04:02:47,179 --> 04:02:49,842
(laughter)

3605
04:02:49,842 --> 04:02:54,930
MARISHA: Can Grog lift it okay, I guess? He's
probably the only one.

3606
04:02:54,930 --> 04:02:58,240
MATT: Yeah, you can lift it fine. You have a 26
strength, you're like--

3607
04:02:58,240 --> 04:03:00,416
TRAVIS: A message from beyond!

3608
04:03:00,416 --> 04:03:02,414
(laughter)

3609
04:03:02,414 --> 04:03:14,245
MATT: As you're walking downstairs, Cassandra,
who's awake and in her nightwear, groggily steps

3610
04:03:14,245 --> 04:03:20,798
down the stairs and sees you. "Oh, um, how's it
gone?"

3611
04:03:20,798 --> 04:03:29,998
LAURA: It went great, no problems at all. Totally
took care of the problem in the woods, and you are

3612
04:03:29,998 --> 04:03:32,863
safe, and so is all of Whitestone.

3613
04:03:32,863 --> 04:03:34,481
MATT: "So it's a success?"

3614
04:03:34,537 --> 04:03:38,744
LAURA: Yes, great, grand success, by a mile, just
totally a success.

3615
04:03:38,744 --> 04:03:41,041
LIAM: A little woozy, but she did her thing.

3616
04:03:41,041 --> 04:03:44,765
MATT: Even amongst your messy self, she leans in
and gives you a soft hug and holds you for a

3617
04:03:44,765 --> 04:03:50,796
second and pulls away. And she's shorter than you.
For a half-elf, you're average size, but she is

3618
04:03:50,796 --> 04:03:55,091
pretty short for a human, especially for the
amount of personality she wields. But she looks up

3619
04:03:55,091 --> 04:03:56,321
at you and says--

3620
04:03:56,321 --> 04:03:59,595
LAURA: (laughs) The amount of personality she
wields, is what you just did!

3621
04:03:59,595 --> 04:04:07,970
MATT: Emanating! Emanating! From her! Huge tracts
of land. That's not what I meant! Jeez!

3622
04:04:08,041 --> 04:04:09,421
(laughter)

3623
04:04:09,421 --> 04:04:11,132
MATT: You guys, I swear to god.

3624
04:04:11,132 --> 04:04:12,859
LIAM: We are children!

3625
04:04:12,859 --> 04:04:13,964
TRAVIS: Yup.

3626
04:04:13,964 --> 04:04:19,829
MATT: She looks up at you and says,
"Congratulations. Welcome to the chamber."

3627
04:04:19,829 --> 04:04:21,442
LAURA: Oh, thank you!

3628
04:04:21,442 --> 04:04:23,614
MATT: "Our Mistress of the Grey Hunt."

3629
04:04:23,614 --> 04:04:25,287
LAURA: Glad to be here.

3630
04:04:25,287 --> 04:04:31,216
MATT: She pats your cheek. "Anyway, I'm going to
get some breakfast. And--" she looks down and

3631
04:04:31,216 --> 04:04:35,324
notices the somewhat congealed blood that's now
spattered across parts of her.

3632
04:04:35,324 --> 04:04:36,411
LAURA: (whispers) Sorry about that!

3633
04:04:36,411 --> 04:04:40,685
MATT: "I'm going to go put on another dress.
Anyway, welcome."

3634
04:04:40,685 --> 04:04:42,105
LAURA: Thank you.

3635
04:04:42,105 --> 04:04:48,630
MATT: "And I'm glad." She walks back up to her
chamber to change outfit. You guys continue on to

3636
04:04:48,630 --> 04:04:50,982
see Vex to sleep.

3637
04:04:50,982 --> 04:04:54,677
LIAM: Yeah, let's get you into bed, yeah? Get some
sleep.

3638
04:04:54,677 --> 04:05:06,118
LAURA: It's so funny, I had this vision when he
said Grey Hunt, I was going to charge in and be so

3639
04:05:06,118 --> 04:05:11,821
amazing and maybe wear a top hat as I was doing
it, you know, just to be really badass.

3640
04:05:11,821 --> 04:05:12,964
LIAM: A top hat?

3641
04:05:12,964 --> 04:05:15,467
LAURA: Yeah, you know, something very hunt-y, a
sort of thing--

3642
04:05:15,519 --> 04:05:17,387
LIAM: Yeah, I can picture it.

3643
04:05:17,387 --> 04:05:25,724
LAURA: And then it just fell a-fucking-part! I
mean, no, I killed it, don't worry, but then as I

3644
04:05:25,724 --> 04:05:28,939
was doing it, I was like, Maybe I shouldn't be
killing it? I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

3645
04:05:29,004 --> 04:05:31,871
And then I tried to talk to it, and it just didn't
sound like it was listening to me, and then it

3646
04:05:31,871 --> 04:05:35,167
went away, and it might have been going away,
'cause I asked it to go away?

3647
04:05:35,229 --> 04:05:38,276
LIAM: I'm opening the door to her room and leading
her in.

3648
04:05:38,332 --> 04:05:44,333
LAURA: I mean, how many more times am I going to
have to fucking do that? Hopefully not a lot,

3649
04:05:44,333 --> 04:05:45,327
right?

3650
04:05:45,327 --> 04:05:47,560
LIAM: Maybe not ever again, that's what it sounded
like.

3651
04:05:47,560 --> 04:05:48,362
LAURA: Right.

3652
04:05:48,362 --> 04:05:49,491
LIAM: Could be years.

3653
04:05:49,491 --> 04:05:50,758
LAURA: Could be years.

3654
04:05:50,758 --> 04:05:55,628
LIAM: Come on, let's get you undone. I start
undoing the braid.

3655
04:05:55,628 --> 04:06:01,290
MATT: You start undoing her braid, helping her. As
you do, she's falling asleep while standing.

3656
04:06:01,290 --> 04:06:06,356
Fenthras just drops to the ground.

3657
04:06:06,356 --> 04:06:08,037
LAURA: Sinaeth.

3658
04:06:08,037 --> 04:06:12,880
LIAM: Come on, in bed, in bed, in bed. Don't fall
asleep yet, though.

3659
04:06:12,880 --> 04:06:14,481
LAURA: I'm listening.

3660
04:06:14,481 --> 04:06:16,743
LIAM: Are you?

3661
04:06:16,743 --> 04:06:18,052
LAURA: Yes.

3662
04:06:18,052 --> 04:06:21,437
LIAM: If you--

3663
04:06:21,437 --> 04:06:27,888
LAURA: You look like Mother right now. You do.
Keep going. I'm not sleeping,

3664
04:06:27,888 --> 04:06:30,721
I'm just closing my eyes.

3665
04:06:30,721 --> 04:06:32,216
LIAM: Fuck, I love you.

3666
04:06:32,216 --> 04:06:34,718
LAURA: I love you.

3667
04:06:34,718 --> 04:06:41,177
LIAM: So you did it, you did the thing.

3668
04:06:41,177 --> 04:06:42,850
LAURA: Yeah!

3669
04:06:42,850 --> 04:06:50,481
LIAM: Yeah. You've carved out a little spot for
yourself here, for now.

3670
04:06:50,481 --> 04:06:53,984
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah, I guess so.

3671
04:06:53,984 --> 04:07:06,592
LIAM: This is the second half of that
conversation. We have nothing left to do in the

3672
04:07:06,592 --> 04:07:08,337
short term.

3673
04:07:08,337 --> 04:07:10,172
LAURA: Right.

3674
04:07:10,172 --> 04:07:25,970
LIAM: And you love Percival. And Percival loves
you.

3675
04:07:25,970 --> 04:07:28,929
LAURA: So much, like, he's just so in love.

3676
04:07:28,929 --> 04:07:30,169
LIAM: No duh, no duh.

3677
04:07:30,169 --> 04:07:31,718
LAURA: Obviously.

3678
04:07:31,718 --> 04:07:35,036
LIAM: And I love Keyleth.

3679
04:07:35,036 --> 04:07:37,897
LAURA: Mm-hm.

3680
04:07:37,897 --> 04:07:40,078
LIAM: And Kiki loves me.

3681
04:07:40,078 --> 04:07:42,688
LAURA: Just so much.

3682
04:07:42,688 --> 04:07:44,217
LIAM: I don't know.

3683
04:07:44,217 --> 04:07:45,476
LAURA: So much.

3684
04:07:45,476 --> 04:07:50,989
LIAM: I don't want to set a time on it, but--

3685
04:07:50,989 --> 04:07:52,424
LAURA: You're leaving?

3686
04:07:52,424 --> 04:07:58,836
LIAM: You are going to stay here for a while. Yes,
and you're welcome to come with me, but I don't

3687
04:07:58,836 --> 04:08:00,636
think you want to go.

3688
04:08:00,636 --> 04:08:02,459
LAURA: No.

3689
04:08:02,459 --> 04:08:07,106
LIAM: You know, I had hoped we'd have the Gate
Stone for this moment, but--

3690
04:08:07,106 --> 04:08:09,323
LAURA: Wait, are you fucking leaving now?

3691
04:08:09,323 --> 04:08:10,908
LIAM: No, no, no, no!

3692
04:08:10,908 --> 04:08:12,115
LAURA: I sit up.

3693
04:08:12,115 --> 04:08:19,279
LIAM: No, no, don't jump ahead of yourself. I just
meant, we have work to do. I'm going to go to

3694
04:08:19,279 --> 04:08:23,475
Zephra, and you're going to be nobility?

3695
04:08:23,475 --> 04:08:25,431
LAURA: I don't fucking know.

3696
04:08:25,431 --> 04:08:26,891
LIAM: That's funny.

3697
04:08:26,891 --> 04:08:29,464
LAURA: How stupid is that?

3698
04:08:29,464 --> 04:08:35,041
LIAM: Just a little bit. But you wear it really
well. Really well. You're classier than I am.

3699
04:08:35,041 --> 04:08:37,643
LAURA: Thanks, you know, I'm going to get some
dresses made, it's no big deal. Imma be so

3700
04:08:37,643 --> 04:08:39,046
classy.

3701
04:08:39,046 --> 04:08:45,477
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to go, you're going to stay
here. But now we have some homework to do.

3702
04:08:45,477 --> 04:08:50,397
LAURA: About what? About--

3703
04:08:50,397 --> 04:08:52,535
LIAM: Gods.

3704
04:08:52,535 --> 04:08:54,857
LAURA: Ugh, yeah.

3705
04:08:54,857 --> 04:09:00,489
LIAM: Yeah. Keyleth can get us anywhere when we
need.

3706
04:09:00,489 --> 04:09:03,078
LAURA: Yeah, she's super, super badass.

3707
04:09:03,078 --> 04:09:11,559
LIAM: Yeah, but you and I need to-- Well, we need
to enjoy ourselves, you need to enjoy yourself,

3708
04:09:11,559 --> 04:09:20,544
but we also need to meet up and do a little
research, because-- Calm down, you made the offer,

3709
04:09:20,544 --> 04:09:21,660
not me.

3710
04:09:21,660 --> 04:09:23,439
LAURA: I know, I know! I'm an idiot!

3711
04:09:23,439 --> 04:09:24,861
LIAM: So am I.

3712
04:09:24,861 --> 04:09:27,619
LAURA: (laughs) This is so stupid!

3713
04:09:27,619 --> 04:09:28,900
LIAM: But we need to spend a little--

3714
04:09:28,900 --> 04:09:33,986
LAURA: Why are we making plans for it? I mean, I'm
so excited about it.

3715
04:09:33,986 --> 04:09:37,270
LIAM: We're making plans for it because she is not
done.

3716
04:09:37,270 --> 04:09:38,780
LAURA: I know!

3717
04:09:38,780 --> 04:09:40,400
LIAM: You don't know.

3718
04:09:40,400 --> 04:09:41,797
LAURA: No, I do!

3719
04:09:41,797 --> 04:09:46,969
LIAM: She spoke to me, Vex. Vex'ahlia.

3720
04:09:46,969 --> 04:09:49,372
LAURA: Okay.

3721
04:09:49,372 --> 04:09:57,786
LIAM: And we're all, all of them are tied up in
this, and we need to have some idea of what we're

3722
04:09:57,786 --> 04:10:04,558
doing, because whatever just happened is just a
test run in her eyes.

3723
04:10:04,558 --> 04:10:12,058
LAURA: Oh, you mean, hell? I know! No, all of it,
right? The dragons, everything, I know what you're

3724
04:10:12,058 --> 04:10:13,216
talking about.

3725
04:10:13,216 --> 04:10:14,271
LIAM: Yeah.

3726
04:10:14,271 --> 04:10:22,169
LAURA: I know! The thing is, what are we going to
do? We don't know when she's going to cash in on

3727
04:10:22,169 --> 04:10:23,123
this!

3728
04:10:23,123 --> 04:10:25,685
LIAM: No, no, it could be a decade from now. Yes.

3729
04:10:25,685 --> 04:10:29,457
LAURA: Exactly! So what are you going to do? Live
a decade going, the Raven Queen's expecting

3730
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:33,612
something, or are you going to live a decade
going, well here's my fuck-all life,

3731
04:10:33,612 --> 04:10:35,432
I'm enjoying it?

3732
04:10:35,432 --> 04:10:36,701
LIAM: Both of those things.

3733
04:10:36,701 --> 04:10:38,126
LAURA: Okay! Good!

3734
04:10:38,126 --> 04:10:42,695
LIAM: I want to enjoy myself, but just in case
it's sooner rather than later, you and I need to

3735
04:10:42,695 --> 04:10:46,150
do a little bit of homework, which you were very
good at in school.

3736
04:10:46,150 --> 04:10:53,326
LAURA: I'm awesome at homework and killing giant
gray things. I can't remember its name anymore.

3737
04:10:53,326 --> 04:10:55,958
TRAVIS: (whispers) Render.

3738
04:10:55,958 --> 04:10:57,744
LAURA: Renders.

3739
04:10:57,744 --> 04:11:04,038
LIAM: I'm going to Zephra.

3740
04:11:04,038 --> 04:11:06,384
LAURA: When? Why do you keep saying it?

3741
04:11:06,384 --> 04:11:12,893
LIAM: Eventually. Eventually. Because it hurts,
because I love you, because you are-- Stop, stop

3742
04:11:12,893 --> 04:11:33,043
laughing for a minute. You are my best friend. You
are my twinnie. And only you know

3743
04:11:33,043 --> 04:11:36,920
what that means. Hm?

3744
04:11:36,920 --> 04:11:38,744
LAURA: Mm-hm.

3745
04:11:38,744 --> 04:11:43,209
LIAM: You're always here.

3746
04:11:43,209 --> 04:11:55,720
LAURA: Well, good. It's all right if you go, dear.
You'll still be here. I'll still be there. It's

3747
04:11:55,720 --> 04:11:58,642
going to suck giant dick.

3748
04:11:58,642 --> 04:12:01,432
LIAM: I don't know how to do anything 
without you!

3749
04:12:01,432 --> 04:12:07,217
LAURA: Yeah, well, you'll learn. You'll learn.
You're learning already.

3750
04:12:07,268 --> 04:12:11,494
LIAM: I'm very proud of you.

3751
04:12:11,494 --> 04:12:17,835
LAURA: Are you going to get married? I think you
should. I feel like you're going to do it, I feel

3752
04:12:17,835 --> 04:12:22,006
like it's going to happen. I just want to be there
for the wedding. Don't go off in secret and do it,

3753
04:12:22,006 --> 04:12:30,805
all right? I would be very pissed. I love you. Let
me sleep.

3754
04:12:30,805 --> 04:12:34,521
LIAM: Okay. Do you need to yak before you go?

3755
04:12:34,521 --> 04:12:37,041
LAURA: Nah, I'm going to yak in my sleep. I'm
going to lay on my side.

3756
04:12:37,041 --> 04:12:41,375
LIAM: That sounds bad! Good night, good night.

3757
04:12:41,375 --> 04:12:42,605
LAURA: Good night.

3758
04:12:42,605 --> 04:12:44,026
LIAM: See you in the morning.

3759
04:12:44,026 --> 04:12:49,409
MATT: As she lays over and almost immediately
passes out on the bed. You give a long gaze as you

3760
04:12:49,409 --> 04:12:55,815
step out of the room, Vax. You turn and out of the
corner of your eye you see a very faint movement.

3761
04:12:55,815 --> 04:13:02,772
You glance over at the edge of the wall, next to the
door, where you leaned Fenthras against the stone.

3762
04:13:02,825 --> 04:13:07,767
You watch as elements of the vines and the curves
and the designs of Fenthras seem to almost grow

3763
04:13:07,972 --> 04:13:19,616
and curl even further. The bow seems to have
established a more prominent visual presentation.

3764
04:13:19,616 --> 04:13:24,753
LIAM: (whispers) You're going to have a very good
morning. Good night.

3765
04:13:24,753 --> 04:13:38,705
MATT: So as Vox Machina completes the final legs
of their recent journeys, they come, for the first

3766
04:13:38,705 --> 04:13:48,648
time in a long time, to a period of local and
nationwide peace, with much to pick up, much to

3767
04:13:48,648 --> 04:13:52,982
clean, much to rebuild, and much to discover for
themselves, their relationships, and what it means

3768
04:13:52,982 --> 04:14:01,302
to each individual. You guys have a few weeks to
contemplate what it is you do together and

3769
04:14:01,302 --> 04:14:09,760
individually over the next year. When we return in
about two weeks to Critical Role proper, it's

3770
04:14:09,760 --> 04:14:12,616
going to be a little over a year later from this
moment.

3771
04:14:12,616 --> 04:14:14,485
LAURA: Holy shit!

3772
04:14:14,485 --> 04:14:15,704
TRAVIS: Really?

3773
04:14:15,704 --> 04:14:20,553
MATT: Yeah. We're doing-- we're going to be
returning to you guys. We'll talk about this and

3774
04:14:20,553 --> 04:14:26,115
we'll get an idea of what you guys want to do.
However, next week, we're still having an episode,

3775
04:14:26,115 --> 04:14:33,306
but we'll have the pleasure of Liam O'Brien here
running the next one shot following his last one

3776
04:14:33,306 --> 04:14:37,131
at Warner Brothers, in which both me and Marisha
will actually be able to play it.

3777
04:14:37,131 --> 04:14:39,757
(cheering)

3778
04:14:39,757 --> 04:14:41,814
MATT: So that's going to be fun.

3779
04:14:41,814 --> 04:14:43,590
LAURA: We're all going to be here for a one shot!

3780
04:14:43,590 --> 04:14:45,767
SAM: Is Conan coming? Is Conan O'Brien--

3781
04:14:45,767 --> 04:14:48,440
MATT: Conan O'Brien? Yeah, he seems to be
available, I'm pretty sure, he's not doing much.

3782
04:14:48,440 --> 04:14:50,455
We'll get him and Colbert to guest.

3783
04:14:50,455 --> 04:14:52,480
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

3784
04:14:52,480 --> 04:14:57,930
SAM: Welcome back, Ashley! Now you have to wait a
year to play again.

3785
04:14:57,930 --> 04:15:01,253
TRAVIS: One year later, huh?

3786
04:15:01,253 --> 04:15:06,098
MATT: Yeah, one year later. So we'll talk and
converse individually and as a group about what

3787
04:15:06,098 --> 04:15:10,013
you guys want to accomplish over the next year
without the constant threat of perpetual death.

3788
04:15:10,013 --> 04:15:16,619
And we'll see where that takes us in two weeks for
the story of Vox Machina into the final arc of

3789
04:15:16,619 --> 04:15:25,666
your story. And return next week for the awesome
one-shot. I'm super excited. I've never been able

3790
04:15:25,666 --> 04:15:28,011
to play with most of you guys at all.

3791
04:15:28,011 --> 04:15:29,170
TRAVIS: Never?

3792
04:15:29,170 --> 04:15:30,190
LAURA: It's exciting!

3793
04:15:30,190 --> 04:15:31,009
MATT: It's pretty rad.

3794
04:15:31,009 --> 04:15:34,151
TALIESIN: I think, like, Satine ran a game, like a
half a decade ago that we played in together.

3795
04:15:34,151 --> 04:15:35,163
MATT: Yeah.

3796
04:15:35,163 --> 04:15:37,076
LAURA: You're RPing as yourself! That's what's
weird!

3797
04:15:37,076 --> 04:15:38,057
MATT: Yeah!

3798
04:15:38,057 --> 04:15:39,180
LIAM: You don't know!

3799
04:15:39,180 --> 04:15:40,860
SAM: What if Matt sucks?

3800
04:15:40,860 --> 04:15:42,484
MATT: Oh, I'm going to! I'm going to be so bad.

3801
04:15:42,484 --> 04:15:43,694
SAM: What if he's awful?

3802
04:15:43,694 --> 04:15:44,892
TALIESIN: He is terrible.

3803
04:15:44,892 --> 04:15:48,221
MATT: I'm going to be okay in the DM's chair, but
I am the worst player.

3804
04:15:48,436 --> 04:15:50,882
TRAVIS: He's like, "What does favored terrain get
me?"

3805
04:15:50,882 --> 04:15:52,384
LAURA: Hey, bitch!

3806
04:15:52,384 --> 04:15:57,786
LIAM: Not going to lie, I'm a rules lawyer. Bit of
a rules lawyer. So memorize your fucking Player's

3807
04:15:57,786 --> 04:15:59,719
Handbooks, you amateurs!

3808
04:15:59,719 --> 04:16:03,500
MATT: I apologize in advance. Oh yeah, I probably
should have announced the winner earlier. I feel

3809
04:16:03,524 --> 04:16:08,207
really bad. I got caught up in the story.
Ninjajoel75, congratulations!

3810
04:16:08,207 --> 04:16:09,661
(cheering)

3811
04:16:09,661 --> 04:16:12,765
MATT: I'm sure you already know this and you
probably have known for a couple hours. But,

3812
04:16:12,765 --> 04:16:14,963
anyway, congratulations, you won the awesome
package.

3813
04:16:14,963 --> 04:16:15,884
ASHLEY: How de dur de dur?

3814
04:16:15,884 --> 04:16:17,148
LAURA: How de do dis?

3815
04:16:17,148 --> 04:16:23,036
MATT: How do we do-- All right, well, we'll see
you guys next week for Liam's awesome game, and

3816
04:16:23,036 --> 04:16:26,858
we'll you see you the week after that for the
continuation of Vox Machina's story a year later.

3817
04:16:26,858 --> 04:16:33,407
Until then, rest well, and is it Thursday yet?
Have a good night, guys!

3818
04:16:33,407 --> 04:23:32,117
