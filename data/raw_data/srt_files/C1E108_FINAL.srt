1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
MATT: Hello and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,290
actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
My name is Matthew Mercer, the Dungeon Master and

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,730
the person unable to find a barber who understands
"leave it long."

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,435
(laughter)

5
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:18,679
MATT: But that's okay; it'll grow.

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,847
TRAVIS: Time jump, backwards.

7
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:23,277
LIAM: You look handsome in any hair.

8
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:29,132
MATT: It's okay. But anyway, welcome. Before we
dive into tonight's episode, in which we have our

9
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:38,546
fantastic Scanlan Shorthalt. "Scanlan Sharthard"
would be a much more apt name. Here via satellite.

10
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:39,578
Hi, Sam.

11
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,700
SAM: What's up, guys?

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,976
MATT: Glad you could join us.

13
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,419
LIAM: Wow, look at all that white and pink.

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,741
LAURA: He looks like he is in Miami.

15
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:51,621
MARISHA: The white and pink contrasting with the
fur is very confusing to my brain.

16
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:56,339
LIAM and LAURA: (hum "Axel F")

17
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:02,916
MATT: (singing) No one watching is old enough to
know what that thing is. Yeah, a few people do. And

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:08,248
thank you. I know. All right, so first and
foremost, let me get through our announcements real

19
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:15,248
fast. Let's see. We have very few tickets left for the
live show at GenCon, which we're excited for next

20
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:20,975
week, guys; it's going to be a lot of fun. We're
excited to meet everybody at GenCon. We have our

21
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:28,142
campaign guide debuting there physically at the
booth. We have a panel, we have a bunch of fun

22
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:30,065
stuff coming up, so excited to see you guys out
there.

23
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,624
MARISHA: It's going to be so much fun.

24
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,326
MATT: Let's see. Merch-wise. Laura.

25
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:36,242
LAURA: Hi!

26
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,261
MARISHA: Oh man.

27
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:44,239
LAURA: We have something to show you guys. You
just wait. Hey guys, why don't you roll that

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,815
footage?

29
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,077
MATT: "Hello, Tal'Doreians, and we have an
exciting new product that we want to share with

30
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:57,582

40
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,134
(beep)

41
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:55,836
MATT: "The special Gilmore's Glorious QVC value of
24 gold pieces and 99 copper. That's right! Just

42
00:02:55,836 --> 00:03:00,334

"Goods in the Abdar's Promenade district of Emon."

45
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:20,667
LAURA: Oh, these tarot cards? Hold on, let me open
it up, since you didn't see enough of it in that

46
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,939
amazing commercial.

47
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,514
TRAVIS: Oh my god, they're so shiny.

48
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,477
LAURA: Liam, tell us about the artist.

49
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:32,759
LIAM: Oh, the artist, Ioana Muresan, who is a long
time Critter and has done a lot of art for our

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,482
show, and we love her, and she did such a amazing
job. Thank you. Look at this!

51
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:43,738
LAURA: Go check them out. They're in the store
right now. They're amazing. All of the other stuff

52
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:49,643
that we had is still in the store, as well,
including this fabulous necklace. And the posters

53
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:56,059
shipped, so get ready to get them. Or maybe they're
shipping tomorrow, something like that. I don't

54
00:03:56,059 --> 00:04:01,489
remember. But they're going out. And then the
aprons are shipping at the end of next week, so

55
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,565
you'll be getting those soon, too.

56
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:10,551
MATT: That new card smell. The gold gilding at the
sides is so cool.

57
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,316
LIAM: It's got gilding on the sides. Everything
shines.

58
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:22,489
MATT: Gilmore's Glorious Gold Gilding. As a person
who enjoys collecting cool major arcana, this

59
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,727
makes me so happy.

60
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,224
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby.

61
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,753
LIAM: I'm not going to play. I'm just gonna look at
these.

62
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,452
MATT: Thank you, Ioana Muresan. Your work is
amazing.

63
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:32,740
LAURA: You're amazing.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:39,091
MATT: All righty. Critical Role podcast up to
episode 30 is available. We're working tight on

65
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:46,319
the next batch of ten. Will have announcements
very soon for that. Let's see. People who are Alpha

66
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,789
users, we have all the back episodes of Critical
Role, all the way up from one to 107 available on

67
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:57,700
Alpha. They retroactively added all the bells and
whistles, HP trackers, all that fun stuff,

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,794
conditions, all the little fun things for the
entire show. They just finished it. So you have

69
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:06,060
that waiting for you if you ever wanted to binge
again.

70
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,588
LIAM: They added Horshack back into the cast.
That's a reference that nobody in the audience

71
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:13,570
got.

72
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,027
LAURA: I don't even understand that reference,
bro.

73
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,852
LIAM: Yeah, I know how much older than you I am.

74
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:22,079
MATT: That's okay. Let's see. Do we have a Talks
Machina next week?

75
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,591
TALIESIN: We do.

76
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:29,998
MATT: Yes. So we have Talks Machina at 7:00pm next
Tuesday, Pacific. We have Brian Foster, who will

77
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:37,024
be returning for the glory. And then I think
that's it. I think that's all of our announcements

78
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:42,559
for the evening. That being the case, let's go
ahead and pull ourselves in this evening to

79
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,494
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

80
00:05:45,494 --> 00:07:15,403
[dramatic music]

81
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:25,838
MATT: Hello and welcome back. Goddamn it. (sighs)
Welcome back. I'll remember that. Your dungeon

82
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,000
master will remember this.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,504
So. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in trying to
find a way to seal off the growing threat of

84
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:40,976
Vecna, now restored to physical form and seeking
ascension and achieving it, you've gone to a

85
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:47,744
number of the deities across the Exandria pantheon
of the Prime Gods. Gaining some blessings and

86
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:53,634
gaining bits of essence from these deities to
create something called a Prime Trammel, an item

87
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:58,512
that was used previously during the Calamity to
seal one of the betrayer gods and could possibly

88
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:05,196
put an end to Vecna's newly ascended form and
reign as the only god on the Prime Material plane

89
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,924
across the Divine Gate.

90
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:12,008
Information given to you by the Knowing Mistress
sent you beneath an underwater volcano known as

91
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:20,091
Scaldseat, where you proceeded to learn how to
breathe water and then step into toxic fume-filled

92
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:28,735
tunnels, where you proceeded to breathe through the
water via Grog's jug. Very clever. But

93
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:36,114
finding your way through a short battle with some
of the indigenous life forms there, a mother and

94
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:43,115
two children magma bulettes. You headed down
deeper into the volcanic caverns of Scaldseat,

95
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:55,197
eventually finding a long-sealed series of
chambers by the Allhammer, the deity for craft,

96
00:08:55,197 --> 00:09:00,669
family, and legacy, where somewhere supposedly
beneath this volcano and hopefully within these

97
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:11,096
long-sealed chambers lies the Core Anvil, where
these Prime Trammels can be constructed.

98
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:16,737
As you made your way through here, hearing the
undulating reverberating pounding of some distant

99
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:22,815
piece of machinery, it seemed, heading down the
stairs you were put into a hexagonal chamber which

100
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:29,592
had a square of coals and above that, X bars
against the wall where in the center you saw a

101
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:42,821
gold inlaid seal, almost. What's the word I'm
looking for? An empty triangular shape, a pyramid

102
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:48,471
inverted within this golden seal. And a series of
these iron warriors that were embedded in the

103
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:58,342
walls. Behind the stairway, you saw, and you
identified upon seeing it, means of smelting metal

104
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:05,803
and other forms of material. When Percival was
inspecting one of these warriors, it immediately

105
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:12,965
came to life, and you watched as the glowing
outline of each one of these ten-foot-tall,

106
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:18,261
12-foot-tall metallic warriors glowed bright
orange. They each emerged from the walls with

107
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:23,551
these large two-handed greatswords at their side
and immediately began to incite conflict.

108
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:31,367
And that's where we left off, so to begin this
fray: Where are you guys placed, currently?

109
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:35,216
Percival, you would probably be right about where
that guy emerged.

110
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,773
TALIESIN: I would probably be about there.

111
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:37,733
LAURA: You were on the wall.

112
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,277
TALIESIN: I had my boots on, so I was up by his
face.

113
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:49,667
MATT: Okay, so we'll put you there. Oh god. Here
you go. Grog was by the smelter.

114
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:57,283
LAURA: I feel like I had been looking at the
thing. The big empty pyramid triangle thing.

115
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,992
MATT: So you'd be over in this area.

116
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:12,229
MARISHA: I feel like I was with Vex, maybe on the
other side. Yeah.

117
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:18,666
LAURA: I was on my broom, because I had been
hovering looking at it.

118
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:23,057
MATT: Fair enough. So you'd probably be about--

119
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:31,041
LAURA: About there, then.

120
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:39,873
LIAM: I know that I had just poofed the wings out and
I think I was inspecting one of the big metal men

121
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:44,217
before it came out of the wall. I don't really
remember which.

122
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:49,797
MATT: Most likely one of the ones that was not
attended by another member of the party. So we'll

123
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:56,828
say about here. And Scanlan, whereabouts were
you?

124
00:11:56,828 --> 00:12:06,381
SAM: You know, near things. Can't really see too
well, so put me where-- Let's see. I was at the

125
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:12,055
door when we opened it and then I was beautiful.
And now I'm not as beautiful. So put me near the

126
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,102
door.

127
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:16,922
MATT: Near the door? So we'll put you over in this
one here.

128
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:19,624
TALIESIN: So all of their faces are indented?

129
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:23,477
MATT: Yeah, each one of them, as opposed to the
other warriors you saw in the chambers that led

130
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:28,435
down into this area, have no faces. Instead where
you see are an empty void triangular like the

131
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,396
large seal, but vacuous.

132
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:32,109
TRAVIS: But matches the same shape?

133
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:37,219
LIAM: They didn't Man-E-Faces around? I'm
misremembering that? Maybe I just really like

134
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:38,495
Man-E-Faces.

135
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:42,004
MATT: Which is a good thing. But regardless, I
would like you all to roll initiative.

136
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,665
LAURA: Not so soon! (grumbling)

137
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:58,516
TRAVIS: Is their head height about the same height
as the seal and the crossbeams?

138
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:10,315
MATT: The seal is a little bit higher than where
their heads are. All right, so 25 to 20.

139
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,728
LAURA: 23.

140
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:16,228
TRAVIS: 17.

141
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,453
MATT: 20 to 15?

142
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,600
TALIESIN: 16.

143
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:27,456
MATT: All right, so we have Grog. 15 to ten?

144
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,914
SAM: 12.

145
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,772
LIAM: Oh sorry, I was looking at a book. 18.
Sorry.

146
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:42,526
MATT: All righty. Keyleth, what'd you get?

147
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:45,845
MARISHA: Five. I don't want to talk about it.

148
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:54,348
MATT: Well, that being the case. As these large
metallic warriors are emerging from the sides of the

149
00:13:54,348 --> 00:14:02,501
chamber, wrenching the large metal blades, these
large rectangular almost slab-like swords, bladed

150
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:07,231
on each side, Vex, you're up first. What are you
doing?

151
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:08,516
LAURA: Oh god.

152
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,336
MARISHA: What do we do?

153
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:11,731
TALIESIN: What do you do, hot shot?

154
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:19,342
LAURA: I want to attack them. I'm going to attack
the one next to Percy. Attack-style. I'm going to

155
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:24,893
Hunter's Mark him and then I'm going to attack
him. I'm going to do this, and then this, and then

156
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:25,994
this.

157
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:29,195
TRAVIS: What are things like this considered?
Creatures or golems?

158
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,471
MATT: Constructs.

159
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:37,229
LAURA: God dang it! That was a miss; it was a one.
It was a natural one.

160
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:40,893
MATT: All right, yeah, so you do actually pull
back the arrow and it strikes true. However, the

161
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,795
armored plating is so strong that the arrow
shatters across the front of its armored chest.

162
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,463
LAURA: Fuck! I do it again.

163
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:47,902
MATT: All right, second shot.

164
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,436
LAURA: Oh my god. 21.

165
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:50,409
MATT: 21 hits.

166
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:58,520
LAURA: Okay, well that's good. Oh my god, I'm
going to scream. Yeah, I know, bro. You're not

167
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,058
bro, you're hubby.

168
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:06,588
TRAVIS: She called me "bro." Game of Thrones is
obviously back on the air.

169
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:15,092
LAURA: 14. Don't say other numbers! 14 plus seven
is 21. 24.

170
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:20,931
MATT: 24 points of damage. All righty. And are you
going to stay wherever you are, or do you want

171
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:22,108
to move?

172
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:23,605
LAURA: How high is the ceiling?

173
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,347
MATT: The ceiling is about 30 feet up.

174
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:29,036
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to fly up.

175
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:34,889
MATT: 25 to 30 feet.

176
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,414
LAURA: All right. I'm going to go to the roof.

177
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:37,815
MATT: Okay. You're going to go all the way up to
the roof?

178
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:47,096
LAURA: Oh yeah. Some of that was lightning damage.
That was two points of lightning damage. Because

179
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:50,368
they're made of metal. I don't know if that did
anything special.

180
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:56,221
MATT: Okay. Thank you for the heads-up on that.
All righty. So ending your turn, that brings us to Vax.

181
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:03,651
LIAM: All right. To start, am I within striking
range of him if I back up a little bit?

182
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,661
MATT: If you back up a little bit?

183
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,451
LIAM: Yeah. Do I need to disengage?

184
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:09,264
MATT: You are currently engaged with him.

185
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,828
LIAM: Okay, so that I'm that close.

186
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:12,514
MATT: Yeah. You were inspecting it as he emerged.

187
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,422
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to
Hunter's Mark him.

188
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:17,942
MATT: All righty.

189
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:23,502
LIAM: And then I'm going to stick him in the face
is what I'm going to do.

190
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:27,291
LAURA: Oh wait, I get 3d6 of sneak attack now?

191
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,787
MATT: If you haven't been marking that, yeah. You
should do that.

192
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:33,125
LAURA: An extra four.

193
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:41,019
LIAM: So that's 30 for the first. And for the
second. 30 for both.

194
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,852
MATT: 30 for both hits?

195
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,527
LIAM: Yeah, because I'm at advantage because I'm
going before them.

196
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,617
MATT: Correct. So both hit.

197
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:55,569
LIAM: All right. So the first one, which will get
the sneak attack fun, is ten plus psychic damage

198
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:11,525
is 16 plus sneak attack damage. (counting) 38 for
the first. Plus Hunter's Mark.

199
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:14,160
MATT: Plus another d6.

200
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:29,827
LIAM: 44 for the first and for the second is one.
That's it. Is one plus the Hunter's Mark again,

201
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,960
right?

202
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,402
LAURA: Only Hunter's Mark once on your attack.

203
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,098
LIAM: So it's only for one attack? Because I don't
use it all the time.

204
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,504
LAURA: Just kidding. It's Hunter's Mark every
time.

205
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:38,413
LIAM: Every time?

206
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,772
LAURA: Yeah, no, I know that.

207
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:44,019
LIAM: So five for the second.

208
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:50,224
LAURA: Yeah, sneak attack's only once but Hunter's
Mark is every time.

209
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:54,065
MATT: Yeah, whenever you hit it with a weapon. All
right. So what's that second one you said?

210
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,680
LIAM: Just five.

211
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,244
MATT: Five? All right. Got it.

212
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:04,781
LIAM: Wait! That's not true, sorry. 11. Because
it's not an offhand attack, it's my second paladin

213
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,720
attack.

214
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,460
MATT: That's correct. There you go. 11. Boom. All
righty. And you're going to stay put, or you're

215
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,892
going to move somewhere?

216
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:17,026
LIAM: I'm going to risk an attack while I'm not
hasted. I'm going to risk an attack and back up

217
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,790
about ten and go up another 15.

218
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,305
MATT: Okay.

219
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:24,623
TRAVIS: Yeah, they can't throw those greatswords,
right?

220
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,231
LAURA: Don't give him ideas. Stop it.

221
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,948
MARISHA: You can't be paralyzed or restrained.

222
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:31,395
TRAVIS: Helps a lot.

223
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:38,902
MATT: All righty. So you're also just about at the
ceiling with her. As you shoot up and away, it

224
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:44,390
strikes up quickly after your daggers have been
carving into its armor. Its blade comes up in a

225
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,415
wide arc against you. That is an 18 plus 12. 30.

226
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:52,244
LIAM: 18 plus 12? Just barely hits.

227
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,540
MATT: All righty.

228
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,134
LAURA: Wow. Do we still have our Death Ward on?

229
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,808
MATT: You do, yeah.

230
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,411
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, thank you for reminding me.

231
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:05,754
MARISHA: And our Heroes' Feast.

232
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:09,447
TALIESIN: We're pretty metal.

233
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:18,901
MATT: 32 points of slashing damage as the blade
rakes across the front of your chest and forces

234
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,104
you back even further. Your shoulders end up
slamming into the ceiling from the impact of both

235
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:27,546
you retracting back and the blow itself. Your
wings have to catch you for a second and you're

236
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:32,303
keeping yourself elevated at the moment. Finishing
your turn there. That brings us to Grog.

237
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:40,618
TRAVIS: Right. Standing by the blacksmithing
stuff, I say, you are interrupting Grog's arts and

238
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,142
crafts! And I would like to rage.

239
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,337
MATT: All right. Into a rage you go.

240
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,876
TRAVIS: And I would like to charge at that little
bastard right there.

241
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,141
MATT: This one here on its own?

242
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:50,222
TRAVIS: Yes, please.

243
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,202
MATT: Up into his face you go.

244
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:53,883
TRAVIS: Up into your face!

245
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:54,921
LAURA: Get him, Grog!

246
00:19:54,921 --> 00:20:07,330
TRAVIS: Reckless, regular strike. Not terrible.
29.

247
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,307
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

248
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,486
LAURA: 29 is not terrible. Did you know that?

249
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:18,025
TRAVIS: Hey, that's good. 28.

250
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,341
MATT: Damage? All right.

251
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,670
TRAVIS: The second one. Reckless, great weapon
master.

252
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,006
MATT: Okay.

253
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:31,357
TRAVIS: Just because. That's a million. That's 34
minus five is 29!

254
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:34,940
MATT: 34 minus five? Nice, that hits!

255
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:43,255
TRAVIS: Five, nine, 21, 31. 31 points of damage.

256
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,222
MATT: 31 points of damage. Fantastic.

257
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,780
TRAVIS: And that ends my turn.

258
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,492
MATT: All righty. Ending Grog's turn there.
Percival?

259
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:56,645
TALIESIN: I'm going to cry out to everyone: we
need their heads. Don't hit them in the face, please.

260
00:20:56,645 --> 00:21:03,440
I am engaged. I know, there's nothing I can do. I
am engaged with that thing, aren't I?

261
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,723
MATT: Currently, yes.

262
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,124
LAURA: Maybe he doesn't see you because you're
above him.

263
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:14,019
MATT: You technically triggered it. It's seemingly
aware of your presence. In fact, the moment you

264
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,363
say that, you watch as the metallic head goes
(creak) and looks up right to you, that creepy

265
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:20,365
triangular void staring right at you.

266
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,417
MARISHA: Do you think you can dispel their magic?

267
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:28,757
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to try and take
a run in the other direction. I know it's going to

268
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,436
take a swing at me. Yep, I'm running down the
wall.

269
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:33,163
MATT: This way, to the corner?

270
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:34,414
TALIESIN: Yep, as far as I can go.

271
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,039
MATT: That's about as far as you can get on that
wall.

272
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,028
TALIESIN: I'll start coming that way, too. Not a
full-- it's six spaces., so--

273
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:46,159
MATT: So at that point you'll be about there. All
righty. It does swing at you.

274
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,143
TRAVIS: You'll be fine.

275
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,038
MATT: 19.

276
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:53,237
TALIESIN: 19 just hits.

277
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:54,473
MATT: 19's your AC?

278
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:55,846
TALIESIN: AC's 18.

279
00:21:55,846 --> 00:22:05,399
LIAM: Escher man is down! I love being able to see
everything.

280
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,346
LAURA: I know!

281
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:11,864
MATT: 34 points of slashing damage. Which almost
cleaves you off the wall.

282
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:26,540
TALIESIN: 34 points? Okay, so hold on, let me do
the math on that. (counting) Okay, yeah, I'm at

283
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,876
151 because I had a whole bunch of temporary
points.

284
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:32,558
MATT: As you're running along the wall, it hits
you from behind and for a second you feel the urge

285
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,692
to black out and you fight through it and keep
running. You can feel the warm spreading on the

286
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:40,868
back of your shoulder blades from the blow, and
you careen around that corner and stop, spinning

287
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:42,609
to survey the room. What are you doing?

288
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:45,614
TALIESIN: I pull up. I'm going to take my first
shot. I'm going to take a straight shot and I'm

289
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:52,163
going to blow a point of grit. We'll get to that,
and I'm going to try to get him to drop his sword.

290
00:22:52,163 --> 00:23:00,597
First thing is I'm going to try and get him to drop
the sword. That's a 34 to hit.

291
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,114
MATT: That hits.

292
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,958
TALIESIN: Strength save against a 20.

293
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,342
MATT: Okay. That is a 13.

294
00:23:10,342 --> 00:23:11,863
TALIESIN: Drop your sword.

295
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:17,763
MATT: Its sword clangs to the ground as you fire.
You see one of its fingers is bent back and busted

296
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:22,557
from the impact and it looks over for a second.
You watch as its broken finger (clicks) snaps back

297
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,799
into place and it looks back at you.

298
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:32,699
TALIESIN: Okay, so that was shot number one. Oh
boy, here we go! I've also got to do damage on

299
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:39,561
that, which is-- I'm so sorry, where are all my
dice? There we are. Oh, I didn't do that, so none

300
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:47,881
of that. Where are we going? I'm going to drop
three points of Cabal into this, as well. Oh,

301
00:23:47,881 --> 00:24:03,691
there we are. Six points of psychic damage, four
points of lightning damage, and 16 points of

302
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:05,871
standard piercing damage.

303
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,352
MATT: Got you. And which weapon's this?

304
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:09,430
TALIESIN: Animus.

305
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,992
MATT: Got it. Perfect. All right, so (boom) the
finger curls back and breaks into place.

306
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:20,599
TALIESIN: Next thing I'm going to do, I'm going to
cast Hex on him. Give him disadvantage on strength

307
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,633
saving throws.

308
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,479
MATT: Well, strength ability checks.

309
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:37,087
TALIESIN: Strength ability checks. And I'm going
to take a sharpshooter shot. That's 20?

310
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,541
MATT: 20 just barely hits.

311
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:48,111
TALIESIN: Okay, good to know! Making that note. So
I'm going to drop three more points of Cabal into

312
00:24:48,111 --> 00:25:04,013
that, so that's 20 points of piercing damage, four
points of psychic damage, 13 points of lightning

313
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:09,789
damage, and three points of necrotic damage.

314
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,208
LIAM: Percy's turned into Rambo.

315
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:20,133
MATT: Okay. So the second one you watch as one of
its armored shoulder plates dents inward from the

316
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,917
impact, and there's a small pierced hole in the
center where it seems to have blasted through its

317
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:24,899
armor.

318
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:31,026
TALIESIN: And last shot. I'm going to try and push
him ten feet back.

319
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,311
MATT: Okay.

320
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,286
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

321
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:37,047
(cheering)

322
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,782
TALIESIN: Should have done damage. There's no
damage on a push shot.

323
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,286
MATT: Yeah.

324
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:42,745
LIAM: But he got pushed.

325
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:46,056
TALIESIN: But he got pushed ten feet back. And
hey, I get a grit point back.

326
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:48,548
TRAVIS: Yeah man, when we got pushed in the
playground, that got in your head.

327
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,836
TALIESIN: So he's got to move ten feet before he
can pick up his sword.

328
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:52,084
MATT: Correct.

329
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:56,270
TALIESIN: And that's everything.

330
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:03,190
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn? All right,
it is now their turn. So the one that you just

331
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,709
blasted back, as it skids to a halt, almost slams
against the wall, it looks over at you across the

332
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:13,140
way and then looks around and surveys the room
quickly with its strange triangular vapid

333
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,686
lack-of-a-face. Glances up and sees Vex'ahlia on
the broom above. Goes into a full leap to push

334
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:24,438
with its feet off the wall and attempt to grab
towards you in the middle of the air.

335
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:27,519
LAURA: Oh no. It can jump that high?!

336
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,627
TRAVIS: Like a WWE cage match.

337
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:32,577
MATT: It's half the size of the room, practically,
in height.

338
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:36,410
TRAVIS: This could be real bad. We might get
total-partied right here.

339
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:44,963
MATT: So I'm making this a grapple check, so roll
either acrobatics or athletics.

340
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:52,435
TRAVIS: Whichever one's better. Acrobatics.

341
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:54,758
LAURA: 25?

342
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:57,489
MATT: No. 34.

343
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,773
(groaning)

344
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:07,902
MATT: I rolled really high. So as it leaps in the
air and grabs you, it drags you off the broom and

345
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:16,603
then basically slam-dunks you into the coals.
(crash) Straight over, prone into the coals,

346
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:23,265
landing at the side of them right there. The broom
goes clattering off to the side. It's still

347
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:27,061
chained to you from the apparatus that you placed,
and it scatters across the stonework a couple of

348
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,328
feet from you.

349
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:30,615
TRAVIS: I thought it was just going to slam you
into the ground!

350
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,072
TALIESIN: Oh, it's going to hurt!

351
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:36,003
MATT: You suffer 19 points of bludgeoning damage
from the impact.

352
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:40,251
TALIESIN: Remember you have the temporary hit
points.

353
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:48,464
MATT: And then ten points of fire damage from
being slammed into the coals. You are considered

354
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:56,801
on fire. You need to take an action to put it out
or you take 1d10 damage every turn.

355
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:01,330
TRAVIS: (singing) You whip your hair back and
forth. (screams)

356
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,768
MATT: However, its sword-- and I'll go ahead and
use this as a marker-- the sword is on the ground

357
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:14,618
right there. So it can't use that right now. The
other two can! So this one over there that got

358
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:21,392
shot by you and flew away, as it arcs up, it's starting
to look around to see if it can gain any real

359
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:29,401
intent to go towards you and then glances off to
the side and instead sees the smaller targets, the

360
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:33,657
softer, easier-to-get-to druid and gnome.

361
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,275
LIAM: What a fool.

362
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,019
MARISHA: Bring it, bitch!

363
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:41,085
MATT: Turns to engage both of you.

364
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:44,847
TRAVIS: This is the coal pit!

365
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:53,783
MATT: It's going to stop partway through there,
and it's going to go right up there. You watch as

366
00:28:53,783 --> 00:29:01,475
underneath the head, the armor part in the chest
suddenly hinges open, and you see this bright

367
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:14,473
burning furnace in the center of its chest that
(boom) lets out this extremely white-hot burning

368
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:17,391
angry torrent of flame.

369
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,520
SAM: Can I cast Cutting Words, or can I use
Cutting Words?

370
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,653
MATT: You can, if you'd like.

371
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,479
SAM: I don't know if it's going to do anything,
but sure.

372
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:30,217
MATT: It can reduce damage. Because Cutting Words
can reduce damage on an attack.

373
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:33,812
SAM: Only by a little. I want him to miss, right?

374
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:36,083
MATT: Well, it's going to hit regardless. You guys
have to make saving throws.

375
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,488
MARISHA: It's a cone. It's just going to hit us.

376
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:47,146
MATT: It would be about there. Get all of you,
including the other guy.

377
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:53,900
LAURA: If I'm prone do I still get to roll to roll
through the coals to avoid it or some shit?

378
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,563
LIAM: Yeah, hide yourself under the coals.

379
00:29:55,563 --> 00:30:00,277
TRAVIS: (laughter) Yeah. Like the McDonald's ball
pit.

380
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:05,262
MATT: You do not get disadvantage on saving
throws, so you can still continue to roll. I need

381
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:09,573
Scanlan and Keyleth and Vex to all make dexterity
saving throws, please.

382
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,146
MARISHA: There's a hypodermic needle in here!

383
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,866
TRAVIS: Oh god, yeah.

384
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:16,550
TALIESIN: How very Santa Monica.

385
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,227
MARISHA: Sorry, keep hitting the mic. Just dex
saving throws?

386
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:24,720
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (groaning)

387
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:34,170
SAM: Wait, are you pointing to me? Oh! I have this
dice. It's the first time I've ever used it. It

388
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,284
has poop on it; someone sent me poop dice, and I
think I just rolled a natural 20 because I rolled

389
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:40,652
the poop.

390
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:42,414
MATT: What's on the other side of the poop?

391
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:44,153
SAM: The other side is a skull.

392
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,734
TRAVIS: So that's a one, right?

393
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:48,009
LAURA: I think for you, you count the poop as a
20.

394
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,943
SAM: Is poop 20 or is poop one?

395
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:52,067
LAURA: I think poop is normally one.

396
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,643
MATT: What's next to the poop? What other numbers
are near it?

397
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,190
SAM: 19, 13, and seven.

398
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,038
MATT: No, that's a one. Two ones on that!

399
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:04,331
LAURA: You got a one, as well?

400
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:07,056
MARISHA: No, I rolled a three, so I'm at seven.

401
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:13,613
MATT: Yeah, so Keyleth and Scanlan, you both from
the chest furnace take 38 point of fire damage as

402
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:17,932
it burns out in front of it. You take half that.

403
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:19,742
LAURA: Okay. Which is what?

404
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:25,630
MATT: It's 19 points of fire damage to you. And
the flames burn across the other armored

405
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,575
individual, the giant construct, and you watch as
some of its damaged form begins to seal up from

406
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:32,043
the flames.

407
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:37,255
LAURA: Flames help it. Fire heals them. Cold
damage. Do cold damage!

408
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,742
TRAVIS: Fire bad!

409
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:40,975
TALIESIN: Fire good!

410
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,733
TRAVIS: Is good?

411
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,772
MARISHA: You said minus 38, right?

412
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:53,845
MATT: So that's going to end its turn. The chest
slams shut now and the flames retract back inside,

413
00:31:53,845 --> 00:32:00,642
and you watch it exhaust smoke out each sides of
its armor, and the flames that you saw burning in

414
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:04,422
there are now dimmed, but beginning to flare up
again. The one that's by you, Grog, is going to go

415
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:09,908
ahead and move adjacently. Its head spins around
for a second to look up at you and then it spins

416
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:14,324
back to you, it's going to make two strikes at you
with its greatsword. It has advantage on you

417
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:15,743
because you used reckless.

418
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:17,077
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

419
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:20,491
MATT: All right. That is 31.

420
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,688
TRAVIS: That hits.

421
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:26,733
MATT: That is 30.

422
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,838
TRAVIS: 30 points of damage.

423
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:30,072
MATT: No, that's two attacks.

424
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:31,600
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, they both hit. Of course.

425
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:43,102
MATT: Okay. So for these, 33 points of slashing
damage, reduced to half.

426
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,151
TRAVIS: What is that?

427
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:48,444
MATT: So that's 16? Right? Yeah.

428
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,688
LAURA: 31 divided by two? Yeah.

429
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:59,414
MATT: Well it's 33 divided by two. And then the
other one is another 34.

430
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:00,571
TRAVIS: Damn!

431
00:33:00,571 --> 00:33:08,766
MATT: So there you go. Round down, so 16 points of
slashing damage. So that's going to end its turn

432
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:11,577
there. All right, bringing us to Scanlan. Your
turn.

433
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:13,086
LAURA: Do something amazing.

434
00:33:13,086 --> 00:33:20,534
SAM: I'm on vacation, so nothing's going to be
amazing. Is the sword still on the ground?

435
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:21,729
MATT: It is.

436
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,394
SAM: Is it near me?

437
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,412
MATT: It's about 25 feet from you.

438
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:35,422
SAM: Okay, I will cast Bigby's Hand! And I will
pick up the sword and I will use it to hit not the

439
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:39,387
guy whose sword it was, but the guy closest to
me.

440
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:40,663
MATT: Okay.

441
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:44,448
LAURA: They're technically both equidistant from
you.

442
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,277
SAM: Okay. Doesn't matter. I want the guy who hit
me.

443
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:55,323
MATT: Okay, so you can move Bigby's Hand. I'll see
how many feet it can move, because it'll pick up

444
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,869
the sword, I don't know if it can--

445
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,354
SAM: It can move 60 feet.

446
00:33:58,354 --> 00:34:05,565
MATT: It can move 60 feet? Okay then! Then yes, it
definitely can. It darts over to the guy who hit

447
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:12,641
you with the flames, so go ahead and make your
attack. I'll say for the purposes of this, I'll

448
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:16,504
add an additional d12 slashing damage to its
strike.

449
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:21,490
SAM: I got an 18. Plus something; I don't know.

450
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,250
MATT: 18 to roll for its attack, plus your spell
attack, so that definitely hits.

451
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:34,086
SAM: Oh, plus 11. Yeah, that's huge. Is this a
sword attack, or is this Bigby's Hand's clenched

452
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:35,212
fist attack?

453
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:38,711
MATT: I'm making it a clenched fist attack, so
it's 4d8 force damage from adding an additional

454
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:41,965
d12 slashing because it's wielding a sword while
it does it, because that's cool.

455
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:53,895
SAM: That's cool. Okay, I love you, and thank you.
So I roll 4d8. Cool. Oh wait, wrong one.

456
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:55,660
MATT: 4d8 plus 1d12.

457
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,284
SAM: 4d8, 17 plus 12, 29.

458
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:00,880
LAURA: Well, plus a 1d12.

459
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,368
MATT: Plus you have to roll a d12.

460
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:07,654
SAM: Oh! Sorry, thank you. Then it's 17 plus
seven.

461
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:14,020
MATT: Okay. 24 points of damage to him. All right,
perfect. So the fist comes by and slams into it.

462
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,131
The sword arcs through its armor and you watch
some of the plates separate a bit, but it's still

463
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:20,597
holding itself in place. That's your action?

464
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:30,861
SAM: Oh, I get a bonus. I will inspire Keyleth. I
guess. Not that she needs any help; she's so

465
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:37,559
fricking powerful, but I will inspire Keyleth by
singing (singing) Your Minxie brings all the boys

466
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:43,033
to the yard and they're like, it's better than
yours, damn right, it's better than yours, you can

467
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,784
teach them, but you'd have to "chorge?" (speaking)
I don't know.

468
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:54,757
MATT: Take a d12 "chorge" die. All right. And do you
want to move at all?

469
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:58,429
SAM: I'm close to a guy who's going to hit me if I
move, right?

470
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:05,168
MATT: You're not currently in melee with a guy
yet, but you're on the outside of melee with two

471
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,190
guys.

472
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,002
SAM: Then I will move dead center on the board.

473
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:14,257
MATT: All right, so you're going to move back up the
stairs a bit, then. You'll be here. That ends your

474
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:18,241
turn, Scanlan. Keyleth, you're up.

475
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,993
MARISHA: Do you need help off the coals?

476
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,553
LAURA: I'll figure it out.

477
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:36,516
MARISHA: You're fine, right? Okay. I am going to
turn and do a Tidal Wave against this guy in front

478
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:44,457
of me, so he has to make a dexterity saving throw.
Tidal Wave.

479
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:47,505
MATT: Pull this up real fast.

480
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,229
TRAVIS: Away, the guy behind you or the one across the
pit?

481
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:54,084
TALIESIN: The one closest to us, or the one on the
other side?

482
00:36:54,084 --> 00:37:02,747
MARISHA: Let me see. (counting) I don't think I
can hit both of them with most of my stuff.

483
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:06,151
LAURA: Can you hit the two that are by us?

484
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:10,102
MARISHA: I can, but I think it'd also hit you.
It's a straight line.

485
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,825
LAURA: How much damage is it?

486
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:14,465
MARISHA: 4d8 bludgeoning.

487
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,687
LAURA: Put me out, I wouldn't be on fire anymore.

488
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:21,955
MATT: You can do it in a way that would probably
hit both of them, but it would probably hit her,

489
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:22,641
as well.

490
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,380
LAURA: Do it!

491
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,591
MARISHA: Are we concerned about me extinguishing
these coals? We can light coals again, right?

492
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:32,231
LAURA: Unless they're magic.

493
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:34,608
TRAVIS: I have made fire.

494
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:40,663
MARISHA: Okay, cool, then with permission from
Vex, I'll put you out! And then I'll step out of

495
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:42,323
the way.

496
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:46,999
LAURA: Maybe it'll push me out of the coals.

497
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,392
TRAVIS: It's going to turn this room into a
sauna.

498
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:55,193
MARISHA: Yes! I'm turning into a sauna! I'm going
to hit that and go (boom).

499
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:59,498
MATT: All right, so it slams across them. All
right, dexterity saving throw for Vex and both of

500
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:00,537
them.

501
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:03,431
LIAM: This combat just got a lot sexier.

502
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:06,392
MATT: (laughs) 18 and a nine.

503
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:07,918
MARISHA: Fail. Both of them.

504
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,604
LAURA: Oh, do I roll a dexterity save, too?

505
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:11,732
MATT: You do.

506
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:19,735
LAURA: I think I fail it. Oh no. 16, fail.

507
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:29,249
MATT: Knocked prone, knocked prone. Okay yeah, so
you take the full damage, as well, but you are no

508
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:30,588
longer on fire.

509
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:35,790
LAURA: Yay! Did I get pushed out of the coals from
the water?

510
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,738
MATT: No, but the coals are no longer burning, so
it's not a huge deal, at least that edge of it

511
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:40,116
isn't.

512
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:46,192
MARISHA: So they take 19 damage, they're knocked
prone, and the water extinguishes all unprotected

513
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,393
flames.

514
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:54,041
MATT: So as this giant column of flame roars up,
you watch as one of the constructs disappears into

515
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:59,500
the water and gets slammed into the wall,
(sloshing) over the coals, temporarily douses you,

516
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,244
flames go out but you get battered around briefly
by the other guy behind you, both of your forms

517
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:11,139
crash into each other. He falls onto his back and
as the water subsides steam fills the room now,

518
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:13,530
visibility is now limited.

519
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,450
MARISHA: Like a fog cloud?

520
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:21,586
MATT: Yeah. Everybody in here for the most part,
unless you're directly in melee range, you're at

521
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:23,575
partial cover.

522
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,900
LAURA: Is it up through, all the way to the
ceiling?

523
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,036
MATT: Yeah, it only lasts a round or so, then
it'll dissipate. But for the next round or so

524
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,954
there's partial cover for anybody not directly in
melee.

525
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:38,874
MARISHA: Partial cover? So it works both ways.

526
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:40,914
MATT: Yeah. Against them and you.

527
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:43,223
TRAVIS: As if Vax needed any other reason to
hide.

528
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:47,263
MARISHA: I can feel the chat saying "Thanks
Keyleth." I can feel it!

529
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:50,345
LAURA: You know what? Seriously though, thanks
Keyleth.

530
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:55,441
MATT: Are you going to stay where you are?

531
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:56,945
MARISHA: Yeah.

532
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,745
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. We're at the
top, Vex, you're up.

533
00:39:58,745 --> 00:40:07,712
MARISHA: No, wait! I'm going to take my bonus
action to go water elemental. And then I can still

534
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:18,427
move, right? Can I then move my water elemental
into this guy's space and as part of my elemental

535
00:40:18,427 --> 00:40:23,938
form I can move into spaces that are within an
inch.

536
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:27,115
MATT: Yeah. That'll do.

537
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:31,525
MARISHA: Can I enter a hostile creature's space?

538
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:37,703
MATT: Yeah. Perfect. All righty. That ends your
turn. Vex, now it's your turn.

539
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,906
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to stand up.

540
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,631
MATT: You get up, (groans). The flames are gone.
You're still aching from being slammed so heavily

541
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:48,420
into the coals there and you can look down, you
can see beneath the water that has turned to steam

542
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,031
and is dissipating on the middle of the hot metal
floors of this room. The construct is still

543
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,524
thrashing and about to get its way back up. What
are you doing?

544
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:58,814
LAURA: I can see him good enough though to shoot
him?

545
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:00,063
MATT: Oh yeah, he's right there.

546
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:03,088
LAURA: Am I at disadvantage because he's prone,
but he's right there?

547
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:10,341
MATT: You're at disadvantage both because prone
and you guys are in melee. You can back up if you

548
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:14,217
want to to try, I mean unfortunately because he's
on the ground and it's a ranged weapon, it's still

549
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:20,268
disadvantage. It's nothing to do with the weapon,
it's the fact that he's on the ground, prone.

550
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,345
TALIESIN: Oh it's on the ground, okay.

551
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,502
LAURA: Okay well I'm going to back up, because he
can't take a strike at me, right?

552
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:26,259
MATT: He can take a swing at you, but it'll be his
fists.

553
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:28,492
LAURA: I'm going to back towards the stairs where
Scanlan is.

554
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:34,121
MATT: So you're back up towards the stairway
there. It does get one swing at you, no he already

555
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:38,011
got-- no, because your turn is before his, so he
does have his reaction. So he swings out with a

556
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:41,125
fist at you, that is a 21.

557
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,391
SAM: I will Cutting Words that.

558
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:44,878
MATT: Okay.

559
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,139
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan!

560
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:49,473
MATT: Well, what are your Cutting Words to him?

561
00:41:49,473 --> 00:42:01,868
SAM: Oh. I'm going to quote from some old TV show
and say: you are a monstrous mechanised misguided

562
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:04,302
moron! That's it.

563
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:06,873
MATT: Very nice. Go ahead and roll a d12.

564
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:08,995
TRAVIS: I don't know that TV show.

565
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:10,541
TALIESIN: I think it's Lost in Space.

566
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:17,070
SAM: Correct, Taliesin Jaffe! Oh shit, I only
rolled a three.

567
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,426
LAURA: Does that Cutting Words him down to 19 or
18?

568
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:23,780
MATT: Yeah, that brings him down to an 18.

569
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,257
LAURA: Then he doesn't hit me.

570
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:30,921
MATT: As the fist swings wide, the words seem to
strangely cut through to what element of an ego

571
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:38,942
this charisma-one creature has and slams into the
metal, causing this large, heavy knuckle punch to

572
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:44,019
the ground as it resounds with this heavy (clang)
that shakes the ground. Vex, you manage to move by

573
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,320
without issue.

574
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,613
LAURA: Great! I think I'm going to then try to
attack him.

575
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:51,882
MATT: Go for it. Two attacks with disadvantage.

576
00:42:51,882 --> 00:43:02,863
LAURA: Okay. Ugh, natural 20 was one of them. 30
is the first attack.

577
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:04,970
TRAVIS: It's 20 and an 18, that's pretty good.

578
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,309
MATT: Actually, it's an interesting point, the
prone. An attack roll against the creature has

579
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:11,883
advantage if the attacker is within five feet of
the creature.

580
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:14,461
LAURA: Oh, so if I hadn't moved away I would have
been okay?

581
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:19,932
MATT: Possibly. It's still ranged; you'd be at
disadvantage for ranged in melee, so would have

582
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:21,661
been a regular attack.

583
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:26,509
LAURA: Yeah, so it's not cancelled out, if I
hadn't moved it would have been, never mind. We'll

584
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:33,181
just fucking say it's fine, because then I'm going
to wish I had that crit I just got. So 30 was the

585
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:52,242
attack roll. Okay. (groans) Okay, that is 13, 14,
15. 15 plus one lightning damage. Plus six sneak--

586
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:54,193
no sneak attack, just kidding.

587
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,453
TRAVIS: Did you Hunter's Mark him?

588
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:59,880
LAURA: There's the Hunter's Mark. Five Hunter's
Mark. That's the first attack, and the second

589
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,784
attack at disadvantage is 19?

590
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:08,893
MATT: 19 just misses. Hits the armor, (crash)
shatters across it.

591
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:10,513
LAURA: Fuck.

592
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:13,931
MATT: Is that your turn?

593
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:17,653
LAURA: Yeah.

594
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:18,798
MATT: All right. Vax.

595
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:20,400
LIAM: All right, I want to slam down right--

596
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,811
LAURA: Sorry, can I use my bonus to hide behind
one of those pillars?

597
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:26,372
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

598
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:31,504
LAURA: 16.

599
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,059
MATT: Okay.

600
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:36,083
LAURA: It's foggy in this room!

601
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:41,952
TRAVIS: Vax!

602
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:48,328
LIAM: Yes, all right, slam down right by that
one's head, straight down to the ground,

603
00:44:48,328 --> 00:44:54,954
take a split-second to look up at the watery
druid, shake my fucking head, stab, stab right

604
00:44:54,954 --> 00:45:01,735
into its face. Yeah. Okay, so the first one is a 33.

605
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,267
MATT: 33 hits.

606
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:07,582
LIAM: Yeah, and the second one is 28.

607
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:08,765
MATT: 28 hits.

608
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:12,201
LIAM: All right. So he's prone; he's at
disadvantage. I'm going to dump Smite into both of

609
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:41,038
these. Yeah! (counting) 36 plus the Smite, which is
32, 39 for the first, and then for the second hit

610
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:49,872
is two, six, eight, plus the Smite, eight, ten,
12.

611
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:54,654
MATT: Total damage? All right, so as you slam down
the first strike, you jam it right into the chest,

612
00:45:54,654 --> 00:45:59,956
and as you pull back the blade you watch as one of
the chest armor pieces flips open and the flames,

613
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:03,991
the furnace of its chest that are starting to burn
in again begin to fill with the water from the

614
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:13,679
water elemental, and more steam emerges from it.
As it's starting to feel the furnace burn out, you

615
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,971
reach in with your dagger and find a cool spot and
jam it right in the middle where you see one of

616
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:22,411
the embers is the brightest and as your hand goes
in and strikes it, the ember goes dark and

617
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:26,014
immediately the creature falls limp there.

618
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:33,565
LIAM: Then, so with the way Hunter's Mark works is
I can move it to another as a bonus action? Can I

619
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:35,426
get it over to the one by Grog?

620
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,760
MATT: What's the range on it?

621
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:46,901
LIAM: Oh jeez. 90 feet. Okay, so I should have a
little bit of movement left, so I'm going to shoot

622
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:50,048
back up, high-five my girlfriend on the way, and
go as high as I can in the room.

623
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:52,183
MARISHA: It goes (splat).

624
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:58,365
MATT: Yeah, it's like punching a fire hydrant. All
right, so you're going to head over this way.

625
00:46:58,365 --> 00:47:02,393
LIAM: I'm only 60 feet because I'm not hasted
wings.

626
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:06,798
MATT: Right, but this also is a small area, so
between here, it's almost 30 feet there and then

627
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:08,367
30 feet up, so you'd probably be closer to here.

628
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,702
LIAM: Okay. Awesome.

629
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:15,878
MATT: Yeah, there you go. That ends your turn.
Grog, you're up.

630
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:21,458
TRAVIS: All right, this guy can obviously play
heavy. Reckless, great weapon master, can I make

631
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:24,214
the first attack, I'm going to try for the first
time--

632
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:26,574
MATT: And remember this round, don't forget your
retaliation ability.

633
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:27,551
TRAVIS: Yeah, right.

634
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:28,858
MATT: You forget it a lot.

635
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:37,142
TRAVIS: I do, I know. I'm sorry, I get confused!
I'm going to try a trip attack with my new

636
00:47:37,142 --> 00:47:42,541
maneuvers. It's a d8, right, that's added--

637
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,899
MATT: To the damage, but you still have to roll to
hit first.

638
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:54,541
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless, great weapon master! 30
minus five is 25.

639
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,951
MATT: 25 hits, yeah.

640
00:47:55,951 --> 00:48:03,859
TRAVIS: So 11, 27, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.

641
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:05,258
LAURA: 41!

642
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,309
MATT: 41 points of damage to it!

643
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:10,564
TRAVIS: And he's tripped. Oh, he has to make a
strength saving throw.

644
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:19,438
MATT: Correct. He actually got a 15, and your DC
for your abilities-- do you have that figured out?

645
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:23,890
You should have that figured out. It's eight plus
your strength modifier plus your proficiency

646
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,222
bonus. You're way over.

647
00:48:25,222 --> 00:48:26,642
TRAVIS: Oh! Okay, cool.

648
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:31,560
MATT: So six plus eight. It's 14 plus your
strength bonus, which is I believe eight, yeah.

649
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,059
TRAVIS: 26.

650
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,209
MATT: No, not 26, it's 14 plus eight.

651
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,554
TRAVIS: 76.

652
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:46,654
MATT: Yeah. Sure. So with that, first you knock it
prone onto the ground, tripping out from under

653
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:51,521
itself as you sweep across its legs, you watch as
one of the pauldrons that's built into its leg

654
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:56,496
splinters off, and you can see the inner
mechanisms of the construct's leg. What do you

655
00:48:56,496 --> 00:48:57,841
want to do for your second attack?

656
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:06,643
TRAVIS: I want to hit it again! Reckless, great
weapon master. Thank god for that. Seven. Shit,

657
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,420
that might not be so good. 20.

658
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,709
MATT: 20 just barely hits.

659
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:19,435
TRAVIS: Oh, it hits. Okay. One, seven, 17! Oh, 17
plus ten, so 27.

660
00:49:19,435 --> 00:49:23,589
MATT: You're in melee, too, so the reduce his
ability doesn't really affect you since you're

661
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,473
right up against him. How much was that damage
total?

662
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:26,852
TRAVIS: 27.

663
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:32,272
MATT: 27 points. Okay. As you swipe it from under
the ground and it falls onto its back, it slams,

664
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:36,549
hits the ground with a hard metallic (clang).
Using that momentum you swing back, (wham) and

665
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:39,565
slam down on top of its chest, which caves in
briefly, you can see bits of the flame of the

666
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:44,258
interior furnace flickering around the edges where
the metal's now crinkled inward, exposing the

667
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:47,405
burning flame. Is that your turn?

668
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:55,406
TRAVIS: Can I spend an action surge to do one more
strike into his Gallagher-afflicted chest.

669
00:49:55,406 --> 00:50:00,663
Reckless, great weapon master! That's a lot. 16,
20, 34, 29.

670
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:04,703
MATT: 29 hits. Roll damage. You have two more
attacks with your action surge.

671
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:06,310
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

672
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,717
LAURA: It's just another attack.

673
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:09,344
TALIESIN: Welcome to my world, man.

674
00:50:09,344 --> 00:50:11,051
TRAVIS: 21, 31.

675
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,264
MATT: 31 hits.

676
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:16,332
TRAVIS: Nice. No, 29 was the hit, and 31 was the
damage.

677
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:23,581
MATT: 31 was the damage?! Okay, so as you pull
your weapon up from that first impact, seeing the

678
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:27,609
damage it's done, you grin and you feel the veins
bulge once more in your neck and you bring it up a

679
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:34,191
third time for this one, slamming it down, the
chest caves in entirely and you watch it fall limp

680
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:40,064
as its arms detach and fall to the side. It's
done. You still have one more attack, and you

681
00:50:40,064 --> 00:50:41,215
haven't moved.

682
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:47,869
TRAVIS: Can I turn (cracking) to my right in my
rage and start running across the room to Old

683
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:53,316
Stupid Butt on the wall? 50 feet.

684
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,951
LAURA: Oh, you got to it!

685
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:57,917
TRAVIS: Last one! Reckless, great weapon master!

686
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:00,753
MATT: (laughter) Okay!

687
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:03,548
TRAVIS: That's a million. 35, 30?

688
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:04,854
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

689
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:10,388
TRAVIS: Okay. Five, 21, 31.

690
00:51:10,388 --> 00:51:14,105
LAURA: It's so good when they're within range of
Grog.

691
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:19,578
MATT: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn, Grog.
That brings us to Percival.

692
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:26,549
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a point of dead-eye
to that last one that's on the ground, and I think

693
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:40,714
that cancels out the disadvantage. Yeah, let's just
shoot him. Yeah, that's a 27.

694
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,045
MATT: 27 hits.

695
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:55,307
TALIESIN: That's ten points of damage, two points
of necrotic, two points of psychic. And do the

696
00:51:55,307 --> 00:52:00,409
same. That's 32.

697
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,671
MATT: That hits.

698
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:06,904
(groaning)

699
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:10,090
TALIESIN: What a senseless waste of human life.

700
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,592
LAURA and LIAM: The tarot cards!

701
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:13,980
TALIESIN: Tarot cards are fine!

702
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,542
MARISHA: They're actually fine. They were on the
box.

703
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:17,727
MATT: Just let me know what magical items you need
me to re-print out for you.

704
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:19,085
TALIESIN: All of them!

705
00:52:19,085 --> 00:52:22,371
MARISHA: And your new dice box.

706
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:24,256
LAURA: Can we get some paper towels?

707
00:52:24,256 --> 00:52:28,592
LIAM and TALIESIN: Ten points of coffee damage.

708
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:31,071
LAURA: It may have landed on some wires.

709
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:34,328
TALIESIN: That's nine points of normal damage, two
points of psychic damage, six points of necrotic.

710
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:35,732
MATT: Okay.

711
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,889
LAURA: Somebody's running now. Soon as we said
wires.

712
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:43,806
TALIESIN: And for my third shot. That's 30
points.

713
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:45,303
MATT: That hits, yeah.

714
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:50,126
TALIESIN: That's 17 points of normal damage, four
points of necrotic, one point of psychic.

715
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:55,895
MATT: Okay. So after Grog rushed up and slammed in
this one's chest, he pulls back and actually pulls

716
00:52:55,895 --> 00:53:02,760
the armored chest plate that retains the furnace
in the inside off. It's still wedged on the axe.

717
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,685
And as it pulls open you see the flame begin to
spark and billow out of the chest. How do you want to

718
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,357
do this?

719
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:10,722
(shouting)

720
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:12,636
TRAVIS: You are frenzied raging right now.

721
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:13,974
TALIESIN: I want to pour a cup of coffee--

722
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:16,743
(laughter)

723
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:21,931
MARISHA: Morning traffic Percy's like (groaning).

724
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:25,431
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit. I've already got him,
second time I'm going to find very carefully every

725
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:28,976
little crack, and I'm going to get him in there.
I'm going to listen to them bang around on the

726
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:31,160
interior. I'm going to rattle them around.

727
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,667
MATT: You hear the ricochet on the inside
(clanging), as it does, the flicker burns really

728
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:40,569
bright, you can feel it almost burns into your
beard but you pull away real fast, almost like

729
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:46,674
looking out of the trap in Ghostbusters. So you
turn away. The flames (crackle) burn upward and

730
00:53:46,674 --> 00:53:50,493
then immediately go dark afterward, it falls and
collapses to the ground there, unmoving.

731
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,102
TRAVIS: I looked in the trap, Ray.

732
00:53:52,102 --> 00:53:58,481
MARISHA: Ugh, no!

733
00:53:58,481 --> 00:54:00,444
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine.

734
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:05,232
LAURA: The worst. It's seriously under the box
though, on the wires.

735
00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:10,724
LIAM: But coffee and Wyrmwood are the two best
things, so you're mixing the two best things.

736
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,886
(yelling)

737
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,442
LAURA: It's everywhere!

738
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:16,785
TALIESIN: Holy cow. I have a coffee problem.

739
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:21,213
MATT: The coffee-pocalypse has come to Critical
Role this night.

740
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:23,493
TRAVIS: That's an eight-ounce cup. It's a normal
cup of coffee.

741
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,407
TALIESIN: You would think, and I've been drinking
it all night.

742
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:27,884
LAURA: How is there so much coffee?!

743
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:29,317
TALIESIN: I don't know!

744
00:54:29,317 --> 00:54:32,272
TRAVIS: You can caffeinate half of Burbank right
there.

745
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:36,356
TALIESIN: Ignore me.

746
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,313
MATT: It's hard to.

747
00:54:38,313 --> 00:54:49,016
So. As you all take a moment to look around, you
can see that these three warriors now lie broken

748
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:55,299
and destroyed on the ground. Whether it be
drowned, torn apart internally, or bludgeoned in

749
00:54:55,299 --> 00:55:01,493
the center of their chest cavity, they are no
longer moving. You still, now in the quiet, hear

750
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:09,922
the rhythmic (steady banging) that's been
perpetually feeding into the distant background of

751
00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:13,745
this entire structure deep beneath the volcano.
What do you want to do?

752
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:22,568
TRAVIS: Can I look at the golem, the construct
that's down by me? Is his face, the triangle face,

753
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:29,921
is it detachable? Can I remove it from the rest of
his person?

754
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:33,127
TALIESIN: We can always put it underneath the
smelter and pour in.

755
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,838
MATT: Make an investigation check.

756
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:37,944
TRAVIS: Hold onto your butts. That's a one.

757
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:42,502
MATT: There's no button for it. There's the old
fashioned way.

758
00:55:42,502 --> 00:55:46,733
LIAM: I'm going to land down next to the other one
and start looking in the same fashion. Across the

759
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:47,694
room.

760
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:49,101
MATT: Make an investigation check.

761
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:50,448
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

762
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,636
MATT: All right, go for it.

763
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:53,357
TRAVIS: And I will do it the old fashioned way.

764
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:54,675
MATT: So make a strength check, please.

765
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:56,594
LIAM: 27.

766
00:55:56,594 --> 00:56:05,069
MATT: Like most of its armored pieces, the arms
detach, but the head is a solid jointed portion to

767
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:06,280
the torso.

768
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,490
TRAVIS: 22.

769
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,697
MATT: 22. And as you're inspecting this, you hear
this horrible (clanging) sound in the distance as

770
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:19,058
you see Grog with his foot up on the center of the
armored clavicle piece, yanks the head off of it,

771
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:23,187
tearing, causing the metal to bend back and spring
for a moment in the air.

772
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:26,633
TRAVIS: Look, it's just like the one above the
coals!

773
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,065
LIAM: Oh, that's how you do it.

774
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:29,957
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

775
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:32,660
TALIESIN: We've got to do all three heads.

776
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,941
TRAVIS: That's an interesting phrase.

777
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:41,796
LAURA: See if you can smelt some platinum into
that thing, Grog. Should it be platinum? Should

778
00:56:41,796 --> 00:56:43,173
probably be platinum, yeah?

779
00:56:43,173 --> 00:56:47,293
TALIESIN: We have the platinum. Let's see what
happens. Let's smelt the platinum into the heads.

780
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:52,362
LAURA: You know how to do it, because you're a
blacksmith now.

781
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:58,133
TRAVIS: We're not supposed to like, kissy-face the
heads to make some sort of a 3D shape?

782
00:56:58,133 --> 00:57:00,602
LAURA: No, it's already got a pyramid in it.

783
00:57:00,602 --> 00:57:01,790
TRAVIS: Good deal.

784
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,649
TALIESIN: I think we're going to put all three
into the one.

785
00:57:04,649 --> 00:57:10,491
TRAVIS: Sounds like a plan. Can I go over and
archaically remove the other two noggins?

786
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:11,596
MATT: Sure.

787
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:16,732
SAM: May I assist by holding the bodies with
Bigby's Hand while you pull the heads?

788
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:19,587
MATT: Yes, actually. Make a strength check with
advantage, Grog.

789
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:23,448
TRAVIS: 23.

790
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:28,187
MATT: Yeah, so with Bigby's Hand wrapping around
the body, clutching it like an action figure, you

791
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:33,007
very easily (crack) pop the head off, and you now
have two disembodied heads.

792
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:42,972
TRAVIS: One more. Do you want to help me with this
one, too? Yeah! What's wrong with your voice? 18.

793
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:50,163
MATT: 18. (groaning) It takes a little while, and
it pulls off, but it's mildly deformed from being

794
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:56,354
pulled off. It seems like the hole in the face is
intact. It took so hard a try.

795
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:58,384
TRAVIS: We got the ashtrays.

796
00:57:58,384 --> 00:58:02,383
TALIESIN: That'll do. Let's try this.

797
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:06,750
TRAVIS: All right. We head over to the smelting
apparati.

798
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:15,841
MATT: Okay. So you walk on over, and it's a small
furnace built in there with extremely hot coals,

799
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:21,642
and it seems to be an influx of perpetual heat,
but there's a large bellows next to it that you can

800
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:26,952
use to try and increase the heat there for a
temporary, short time, and you once again,

801
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:30,891
strangely, you look over to it and you know exactly
how this works, like you've always worked with it

802
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:38,646
before. So the flames that were a burning
orange-red, extremely hot, begin to flare into

803
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:43,649
bright yellow and white in places. And the heat
emanating from it is enough that it causes a lot

804
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:47,697
of you to get uncomfortable in the presence and you
have to take a step back, Grog enduring it.

805
00:58:47,697 --> 00:58:58,041
MARISHA: I'm still a fire hydrant. Keyleth is on
fire marshal duty. I do some misting, like at Six

806
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:02,560
Flags to cool off Vex.

807
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,351
TRAVIS: You can't just run through you, like Universal
City Walk or something?

808
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:15,683
MARISHA: Yeah. Mainly just to make Vex sexy.
That's really all I'm going for. I turned into an

809
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:18,029
elemental. I've got to do something with it.

810
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:24,452
MATT: Make a check with your blacksmithing tools,
which is your proficiency modifier, and we'll say

811
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:30,344
for this, because it is more of a dextrous use of
this skill, add your dexterity modifier.

812
00:59:30,384 --> 00:59:35,444
TRAVIS: Okay. 24.

813
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:42,208
MATT: 24. So in setting up preparation, you take
each one of the heads, and to fill each one of

814
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:51,793
their-- I want to say concave, but it's an
interior pyramid space. Convex is outward. It will

815
00:59:51,793 --> 01:00:00,895
be about 100 platinum pieces or so to fill each
face void. So you take the platinum, you melt it

816
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:08,797
down into the smelter, get it to where it's in the
gripped, tong-held metallic reservoir, until it

817
01:00:08,797 --> 01:00:14,597
eventually melts down. You then pour it into each
of the heads, so 300 platinum utilized to do this.

818
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:24,399
It fills to the very edge. Some of it spills over,
but you can easily snip that off. As you wait for

819
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:32,880
it to cool, which you can probably help with,
actually, as there is no basin for quenching the

820
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,869
metal at the moment, so the steam (whoosh) rises
up all around, and you turn the heads over, and

821
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:46,289
each one (sliding sound) leaves these heavy
metallic pyramid pieces that are smooth and

822
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:51,463
perfect on three of the sides, and one of them
appears to be almost like a broken crystal on the

823
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:54,527
inside. It's a shattered, messed-up section.

824
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,434
LAURA: Puzzle piece! Got to fit them together!

825
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:58,136
TALIESIN: Okay, so if we fit these together--

826
01:00:58,136 --> 01:01:02,569
MATT: They seem to fit together very well; you
figured it out very quickly, they fit and hold

827
01:01:02,569 --> 01:01:03,500
together.

828
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,574
LAURA: With the jaggedy ends, or with the smooth
ends?

829
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,574
MATT: The jaggedy ends all fit together.

830
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:10,052
TALIESIN: Does this now make another concave
piece?

831
01:01:10,052 --> 01:01:15,002
MATT: All together, it makes a pyramid that comes
to a central point.

832
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,879
LAURA: (shouting) Let's put it in the big thing!

833
01:01:16,879 --> 01:01:22,604
TALIESIN: So I've still got some Spider Climb, so
I'm going to grab one and lift up. All the

834
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:23,518
fliers?

835
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:24,817
LAURA: Yep. Let's go.

836
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:35,198
MATT: Okay. So the three of you make it up, fit it
together, push it in. It fits in perfectly. Slips

837
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:43,471
in. You all back up... nothing.

838
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:45,231
LAURA: We push it in harder.

839
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:46,721
MATT: All right, make a strength check.

840
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:52,336
LAURA: This is definitely going to be really
good.

841
01:01:52,336 --> 01:01:54,048
LIAM: I push on my sister's shoulder blades.

842
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:55,130
LAURA: 15.

843
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,403
LAURA and LIAM: (groaning)

844
01:01:57,403 --> 01:02:02,046
MATT: Right, you guys (groans) get behind and
shove, push. Nothing.

845
01:02:02,046 --> 01:02:03,033
TRAVIS: Can I try?

846
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:04,334
LAURA: Yeah. Grog, you try.

847
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:08,877
TRAVIS: I run across the coal pits and Superman
punch the pyramid.

848
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:10,960
LIAM: I barrel-roll out of the way.

849
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,120
TRAVIS: I rage before I do this.

850
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,376
LAURA: Oh Jesus. There's a dent in it now.

851
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:19,670
MATT: You get advantage on this, then.

852
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,024
TRAVIS: That's what I was hoping for. 21.

853
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:29,676
MATT: (impact noise) The impact on this causes the
whole room to shake almost, from the blast. You

854
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:35,454
hear the echo right up the stairs in the hallway
that you emerged from, you can hear continuing as

855
01:02:35,454 --> 01:02:40,540
it slowly dissipates in the distance. You land,
and you can see there's actually a knuckle mark in

856
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,786
the platinum from the impact. No effect.

857
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:51,793
LAURA: Hey, I've got an idea. What if we take this
thing off of the cross beams, right? And stick it

858
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:55,855
in the coals, or something. Because why are the
coals here, right underneath it?

859
01:02:55,855 --> 01:03:00,692
MARISHA: I drop water elemental form. You think it
needs to be hot first?

860
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:02,239
LAURA: I don't know.

861
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:11,077
MARISHA: I look up, I line up the apparatus and
look across the room, does it feel like there's

862
01:03:11,077 --> 01:03:13,504
any other Indiana Jones--

863
01:03:13,504 --> 01:03:17,682
MATT: The stairway is in the way. Because the
stairway doesn't come all the way to the top of

864
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:24,190
the ceiling, and then back here it blocks this
passage between the two of them, but as you go and

865
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:30,453
look, all it is is the reddish, rust colored
cross-beams that are bolted against the wall, and

866
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:35,179
in the center there's the round golden crest with
the triangle shape which is now filled with the

867
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:38,084
platinum key that you've made.

868
01:03:38,084 --> 01:03:39,895
TALIESIN: Are the coals hot or are the coals
cold?

869
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:41,486
MATT: The coals are currently now cold.

870
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:44,443
TRAVIS: Should we try turning it?

871
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:48,751
LAURA: Oh yeah, good idea! But we should reignite
these coals, because I think it's bad that they've

872
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:50,074
burned down right now.

873
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:56,497
MARISHA: I think so, too. Just to test, yeah, I'm
going to do Burning Hands. How quickly do they

874
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:57,447
catch?

875
01:03:57,447 --> 01:04:01,480
MATT: Pretty quickly. And you get the sense that
they were slowly catching, anyway; there's

876
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:07,214
something about them, the heat that the general
room perpetually emanates maintains the fires

877
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:12,834
within. But your flame with the burning hands very
quickly elevates and quickens that process, and

878
01:04:12,834 --> 01:04:18,303
you watch as the coals now glow to a bright
orange-red hue, and you can feel the heat

879
01:04:18,303 --> 01:04:19,472
emanating from them.

880
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,740
LAURA: Can we turn the circle? Does it move?

881
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,846
MATT: So you go up to the edge and you grab the
edge of the golden crest and tug! And it's not

882
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:27,775
moving.

883
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:29,492
LAURA: Gosh darn it! What are we supposed to do?

884
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,506
MARISHA: Are there any inlays?

885
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:33,784
MATT: Make an investigation check.

886
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:40,383
MARISHA: Okay. It's not my strong point. Goddamn
it, that's like the fourth three I've rolled

887
01:04:40,383 --> 01:04:41,345
today.

888
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:42,642
SAM: Hey, you're inspired.

889
01:04:42,642 --> 01:04:47,791
MATT: (laughter) You are inspired. Up to you.

890
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:52,126
MARISHA: Better. 12.

891
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:57,668
MATT: 12. It's smooth gold, there's no signs or
runes or anything on the side.

892
01:04:57,668 --> 01:05:01,583
TALIESIN: I want to see if there's anything in the
holes that were left by the soldiers who left.

893
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:02,850
MATT: What was that?

894
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:06,324
TALIESIN: The three suits of armor came out of the
wall, so there's now a wall that we haven't seen

895
01:05:06,324 --> 01:05:07,948
behind them.

896
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:10,570
LAURA: Maybe it's supposed to be gold.

897
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:14,693
MARISHA: Platinum is for the trammels.

898
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:18,460
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and look inside which
one?

899
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,340
TALIESIN: I'm going to do all three, but I'll
start on the one on the left.

900
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,951
MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check.

901
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:32,522
TALIESIN: That's investigation check. What did you
do? Six.

902
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:33,822
MARISHA: Is that also a three?

903
01:05:33,822 --> 01:05:35,071
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's also a three.

904
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:39,274
MATT: You look around inside and the shape is a
perfect indentation of the physical form of the

905
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:44,501
three metal warriors. You don't see any signs of
anything beyond enough of a cavity to fit them

906
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:46,510
snugly when they're dormant.

907
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:53,458
LIAM: Hey Scanlan? You want to use your dragon
fisting friend to put that pyramid in the coals

908
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,291
and heat it up and then shove it back in?

909
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:56,799
SAM: Wait, what?

910
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:03,146
LIAM: Do you want to use Bigby's Hand to take that
pyramid, shove it in the coals, heat it up, and

911
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:05,312
see if that makes a difference, shove it back in
hot?

912
01:06:05,312 --> 01:06:10,177
SAM: So you want me to heat the platinum and then
shove into the guy's face?

913
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:14,155
MATT: Bigby's Hand, by the way, at this time has
faded. It only lasts for a minute with

914
01:06:14,155 --> 01:06:17,237
concentration. The spell has faded.

915
01:06:17,237 --> 01:06:20,101
LIAM: Well, maybe the pyramid heated up could make
a difference.

916
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:27,643
TRAVIS: All right, I walk up into the coals, take
the platinum pyramid out, and I'll drop it down

917
01:06:27,643 --> 01:06:28,852
into the coals.

918
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,803
MATT: Okay, it's about 15 feet up off the ground.

919
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:34,095
TRAVIS: Shit. Can I jump, Boots of Feral Leaping?

920
01:06:34,095 --> 01:06:41,360
MATT: You can. I'd say you leap up and grab the
edges of the seal with your giant strength, and

921
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:49,446
wedge your fingers in the side and pull it out and
land on the coals. You do take four points of fire

922
01:06:49,446 --> 01:06:55,649
damage as the coals begin to burn into your feet
and the proximity of the heat. But you

923
01:06:55,649 --> 01:07:00,571
back up out of the coal based center now holding
the key.

924
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:01,847
TRAVIS: I drop it in the coals.

925
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:05,712
MATT: Okay, the three pieces come apart as soon as
you pull it from the section, so you have the

926
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:07,596
three different pieces right there in your arms.

927
01:07:07,596 --> 01:07:11,534
TALIESIN: So when three pieces go together the
part that goes towards the wall--

928
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:14,591
MATT: It's another point. It's like a four-sided
pyramid.

929
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:17,106
TALIESIN: All right, it is a pyramid, so the whole
pyramid goes in the wall.

930
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:19,439
MATT: Yeah, it's a flat seal on the outside.

931
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:22,212
LAURA: I think this needs to be gold, dear.

932
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:23,752
TALIESIN: Why would it be gold?

933
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:25,268
LAURA: Well, the outside is gold.

934
01:07:25,268 --> 01:07:28,353
TALIESIN: That's true.

935
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:31,512
MARISHA: Maybe the platinum is only for the
trammels, not the key.

936
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:34,249
LAURA: We can try it. We have gold.

937
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:37,382
LIAM: Finish my stupid idea, and then we'll move
onto the next stupid one.

938
01:07:37,382 --> 01:07:38,873
LAURA: Good call.

939
01:07:38,873 --> 01:07:42,724
TRAVIS: Has the platinum pyramid started to heat up
yet?

940
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:44,528
MATT: You're holding it in your arms.

941
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:45,752
TRAVIS: I drop it in the coals.

942
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:51,570
MATT: Okay. You drop it in the coals. You wait
about five minutes or so, and you can see a faint

943
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:59,989
bit of heated glow slowly heating up, but these 
coals are not smelter ready.

944
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:04,616
TRAVIS: You know what, I feel like, I feel like,
this is stupid. I pick them up. (pained gasps)

945
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:07,068
Tell me where they go

946
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:20,761
MATT: Okay, make an intelligence check, Grog, to
assemble the three puzzle pieces of the key.

947
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:23,244
TRAVIS: Negative two. Nine.

948
01:08:23,244 --> 01:08:26,758
MATT: (laughs) He's having a hard time putting
those pieces together, guys!

949
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:32,312
LIAM: I fly over, I'm Deathwalker's Warded to fire
and I'm going to start helping.

950
01:08:32,312 --> 01:08:36,429
MATT: All right. You each take five points of fire
damage just helping touch and assemble this key.

951
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:42,067
Once you get it put together you hold it in the grasp
of your hands. You leap using the Boots of Feral

952
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:50,300
Leaping, jam it back inside. Land off to the side.
Nothing.

953
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,161
TRAVIS: Asshole! Son of a bitch!

954
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,692
LAURA: We got to fucking try it in gold! Try it in
gold. Maybe try it in gold.

955
01:08:54,692 --> 01:08:56,365
TALIESIN: I have one other thought.

956
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,287
SAM: What?

957
01:08:57,287 --> 01:08:58,380
LAURA: What is it?

958
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,504
TALIESIN: What's the red armor made out of?

959
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:05,455
LAURA: (gasps) What are the armors made out of?

960
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:11,459
MATT: It's a dark, reddish-black metal.

961
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:14,390
LAURA: Can we melt the golems into their heads?

962
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,758
TRAVIS: What?

963
01:09:15,758 --> 01:09:19,700
LAURA: Melt each one. Maybe it's got to be the
metal they're made out of.

964
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,585
TRAVIS: The triangles are like this big and the
armor is like massive.

965
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:25,467
LAURA: Yeah, so take some of the metal and melt it
down into the head.

966
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:30,076
MARISHA: What is the metal? Can we do a check to
see what kind of metal it is, what it's made out of?

967
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:33,354
MATT: Either of these guys can attempt to do
that.

968
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:35,081
TALIESIN: I can take a look. What would that be?

969
01:09:35,081 --> 01:09:39,826
MATT: This would be an intelligence check plus
your tinkering benefit, intelligence check plus

970
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,759
your blacksmithing proficiency modifier.

971
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,065
TALIESIN: So that's intelligence plus my normal
tinker check?

972
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:45,252
MATT: Yeah.

973
01:09:45,252 --> 01:09:51,203
TALIESIN: So that's not bad. Let's see.

974
01:09:51,203 --> 01:09:52,415
TRAVIS: 19.

975
01:09:52,415 --> 01:09:55,808
TALIESIN: Oh wow! That's 32.

976
01:09:55,808 --> 01:10:01,986
MATT: Okay. So both of you say out loud at the
same time, "Oh, this is volcanic glass metal."

977
01:10:01,986 --> 01:10:15,037
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Volcanic glass metal. Aha!

978
01:10:15,037 --> 01:10:20,275
LAURA: So maybe can we melt it?

979
01:10:20,275 --> 01:10:24,323
TALIESIN: Only in a glass volcano. No, I think it
will melt.

980
01:10:24,323 --> 01:10:27,162
TRAVIS: Do I know if volcanic--

981
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:33,659
MATT: Yeah, it's a--
TRAVIS: It's--

982
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:37,753
MATT: (laughs) It's a type of metal--
TRAVIS: It's a type of metal--

983
01:10:37,753 --> 01:10:39,168
MATT: You're following me on this?

984
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,040
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm following you on it.

985
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:48,480
MATT: Okay, it's an oxidized red iron base that in
the construct and the folding of the metal, to

986
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,920
build the actual armored structure of these
creatures, had bits of volcanic glass folded into

987
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,823
the actual metal as it was created.

988
01:10:55,823 --> 01:10:57,357
LAURA: I feel like that makes it special.

989
01:10:57,357 --> 01:11:02,602
TRAVIS: (laughs) Bring on the Night King.

990
01:11:02,602 --> 01:11:06,820
TALIESIN: We can give it a shot, can't we?

991
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:10,266
TRAVIS: Melt them down into each of the three.

992
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:14,576
LIAM: Why don't you make their dreams come true
and rip their groins off?

993
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:19,569
LAURA: Melt their body into their face and make
triangles out of the metal.

994
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:24,378
MATT: Okay, so because you rolled a very high check,
I'll let you know, that generally heating up a

995
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:30,691
metal to the point in which it's liquid and then
pouring it into the same metal is going to mess up

996
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:32,263
the mold.

997
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:39,818
TALIESIN: That's a terrible idea. Let's try gold.
I would have felt very foolish.

998
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:44,039
LAURA: You guys are so smart about this stuff,
then we should do gold.

999
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:47,269
TRAVIS: It comes, it comes in waves. It's like a
new awakening.

1000
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,731
TALIESIN: We'll try the gold.

1001
01:11:49,731 --> 01:11:55,234
MATT: Okay, so about a hundred gold pieces per
head. So 300 gold pieces removed.

1002
01:11:55,234 --> 01:12:01,211
LAURA: Wait, how come it was 300? Oh, it's not
the same worth, it's the coin.

1003
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:05,462
MATT: Well, it's a hundred gold pieces per face. So
it's 300 gold pieces total. So 300 gold taken off,

1004
01:12:05,462 --> 01:12:11,859
total. You smelt it down, same process, and then
place within each of the three molds, wait for it

1005
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:17,212
to cool and then you remove the three key pieces
of the solid gold. They all fit together just as

1006
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:18,911
the platinum pieces did.

1007
01:12:18,911 --> 01:12:22,013
TRAVIS: Can somebody go pull that thing out, and
then I will put this one in?

1008
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:23,129
TALIESIN: I'm pulling it out.

1009
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:27,090
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and you pull out the
chunks of heated, now cooling platinum and drop

1010
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:34,683
them into the coals for a moment. You pull them
off the coals, carefully.

1011
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,061
TRAVIS: Can I run up and MJ the new gold pyramid
into the--?

1012
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:40,355
MATT: Sure, make an intelligence check.

1013
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:46,393
TRAVIS: An intelligence check? Oh, because I got
to put them together. Two!

1014
01:12:46,393 --> 01:12:49,622
MATT: Grog is having a hard time with that. Okay.

1015
01:12:49,622 --> 01:12:51,525
TRAVIS: I'm making an origami swan.

1016
01:12:51,525 --> 01:12:57,023
MATT: (laughs) All right, you guys eventually help him
put it together a second time.

1017
01:12:57,023 --> 01:13:03,785
LIAM: That is a really good macaroni art you've
made. It's so good. That's a boat, right?

1018
01:13:03,785 --> 01:13:06,559
LAURA: Let's put it in the key.

1019
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:13,360
MATT: All right. So as they have it assembled, you
rush up, leap jam it in up there and it slides

1020
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,098
into place. You hear a heavy slamming sound
and what sounds like the scraping of heavy chain

1021
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:22,756
mail. (metallic scraping)

1022
01:13:22,756 --> 01:13:26,741
TRAVIS: I grab the platinum pyramid and I put it
in the Bag of Holding.

1023
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:32,955
LAURA: No! I already said that I had them. No. No,
he doesn't do that.

1024
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:39,134
MATT: The wall immediately shudders and you see a
layer of dust and soot, (falling sand) off of it.

1025
01:13:39,134 --> 01:13:46,410
as it falls to rest onto the ground and you see
the wall slowly rise up. (grinding gears)

1026
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:54,709
MARISHA: Wait. I want to prep something. Hide!

1027
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:56,908
MATT: Okay, so who's hiding?

1028
01:13:56,908 --> 01:13:58,142
LIAM: I am.

1029
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,339
MATT: All right, stealth check.

1030
01:13:59,339 --> 01:14:01,597
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm hiding behind the pillar that
I'm next to.

1031
01:14:01,597 --> 01:14:06,007
MATT: All right, so you hide behind there.

1032
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:08,443
TRAVIS: Scanlan, face death with me!

1033
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:13,242
SAM: This is bullshit. I'm going to stand there,
hands on hips.

1034
01:14:13,242 --> 01:14:19,743
MARISHA: I'll hug the wall closest to the door.

1035
01:14:19,743 --> 01:14:23,258
MATT: Okay. All right.

1036
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,592
TRAVIS: It's just going to reveal another
stairway, come on.

1037
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:29,368
TALIESIN: It's going to be another door.

1038
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:32,418
TRAVIS: Did you guys see National Treasure?

1039
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:33,614
TALIESIN: No.

1040
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:35,060
TRAVIS: What?

1041
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,756
TALIESIN: No, I never saw National Treasure.

1042
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:38,088
LAURA: Oh my god, it's so good.

1043
01:14:38,088 --> 01:14:39,942
TALIESIN: Okay, well we'll make an evening of it.

1044
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,593
MARISHA: It's Nick Cage at his most mediocre.

1045
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:42,925
LAURA: St. Nicholas.

1046
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:55,564
MATT: As the door eventually comes to a stop maybe
a foot before it reaches the ceiling, black smoke

1047
01:14:55,564 --> 01:15:01,764
pours in from the other chamber. You watch as it
immediately fills the ceiling and then begins to

1048
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:07,226
dissipate up the stairway and the hallway above
you where you guys originally descended from. You

1049
01:15:07,226 --> 01:15:15,266
see flashes of sparks and embers through these
clouds of black smoke and soot within the chamber.

1050
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:21,995
It's obscuring most of your view within the
inside. And that heavy pounding, that (pounding)

1051
01:15:22,036 --> 01:15:28,260
is much louder now. You can sense that it is
actually the source of that rhythmic beat, that

1052
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:33,525
metal-on-metal clang you have been feeling since
you first came into this series of chambers.

1053
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:41,668
You can see small streams of glowing orange molten
rock within the chamber, which is slightly down

1054
01:15:41,668 --> 01:15:52,869
and before you. Looks like two small ten-foot-wide
rivers of molten rock, metal-- you can't quite

1055
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:57,349
tell from here, but it's glowing orange and red,
and they both convene and go dark in the center

1056
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:01,532
where it looks like they are being covered or
obscured by something that you can't quite make

1057
01:16:01,532 --> 01:16:03,565
out at this distance.

1058
01:16:03,565 --> 01:16:05,236
LAURA: A giant anvil?

1059
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:08,477
MATT: Make a perception check, anybody who wants
to glance in. Right now, the only people who can

1060
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:14,367
look in would not be Percival and Vax because they
are in the way back, and Keyleth is hiding, if you

1061
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,734
want to glance in the side you can.

1062
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:17,042
MARISHA: I can do a peek?

1063
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:17,899
MATT: Sure.

1064
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:18,869
LAURA: 17.

1065
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:20,273
TRAVIS: 16.

1066
01:16:20,273 --> 01:16:21,960
MARISHA: 24.

1067
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:30,464
LAURA: That sound is creepy as fuck.

1068
01:16:30,464 --> 01:16:33,527
TALIESIN: I know, it's a lot of sound.

1069
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:38,453
MATT: What you can make out for the most part is
this central platform is raised. It looks like there's

1070
01:16:38,453 --> 01:16:45,016
a staircase that leads up to a middle platform
that is in the center of this larger chamber, and

1071
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:51,967
it looks to be a couple of large, heavy platforms
or pillars that have roaring flames at the edges

1072
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:59,350
of them. You can see beneath it, the two pools of
lava that disappear beneath it, and you see a hint

1073
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:05,853
of a spiral staircase on each side that curls
around the back end of where those two rivers of

1074
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:16,654
molten rock meet. Behind that, you see the
flashes, (sparking) like these rhythmic engines of

1075
01:17:16,654 --> 01:17:22,606
sparks that are pouring out of the black smoke
that is perpetually filling the upper part of this

1076
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:28,226
chamber. However, since now it has a place to
escape, the room is slowly revealing the interior.

1077
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:42,534
You can see on top of this platform in the center
a large dark metal object, roughly four or five

1078
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:49,084
feet from front to back and about three feet wide
of dark, jet black metal, with small veins of

1079
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:55,067
glowing red and orange that curl around it that
occasionally flare with each impact of whatever

1080
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:57,601
this rhythmic metal clanging is behind it.

1081
01:17:57,601 --> 01:18:04,963
As the smoke begins to dissipate even further,
more visibility reveals the shape of this object

1082
01:18:04,963 --> 01:18:12,385
to definitely be that of an anvil. You can see a number of
chains that are linked to it on each side that

1083
01:18:12,385 --> 01:18:17,552
dangle off the edge. You cannot quite see what's
at the end of these chains; they're falling off

1084
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:21,639
the side of this platform and out of view. You'd
have to get closer to see what they are. However,

1085
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:28,287
the shape that you now see, right behind this
platform, looming at about 20 feet tall from your

1086
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:33,154
estimation at this distance, Keyleth, as you are
the one who sees this before anybody else does. You

1087
01:18:33,154 --> 01:18:44,534
see a stocky humanoid form that is looming over
the anvil, both of its fists resting on each side

1088
01:18:44,534 --> 01:18:52,751
of the platform. You can see its trunk-like arms
and legs are dark gray stone, and the head carries

1089
01:18:52,751 --> 01:19:01,379
no face; it is a smooth absence of face. You can
see red cables that dangle from the top and the

1090
01:19:01,379 --> 01:19:06,943
back of the head that are then pulled together in
the back like a ponytail, and around the center of

1091
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:11,895
its torso and its lower body, these extremely
thick layers of leather wrap that make a kilt

1092
01:19:11,895 --> 01:19:20,441
that dangles past the knees of this giant stone
structure that stands there looming over. In one

1093
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:29,882
of its hands you see a comparably small but
impressive-looking hammer of gold and black that

1094
01:19:29,882 --> 01:19:34,955
is currently chained to the platform. It's the one
that isn't currently dangling off the side. It's

1095
01:19:34,955 --> 01:19:44,053
in its hand and it's resting there. And you can
see the heat emanating from both the pools of

1096
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:51,102
molten rocks on the side of it and the flames
behind. Most of the imagery is perpetually

1097
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:59,519
shifting and being altered by the sheer volume of
heat that this chamber holds. This is apparently

1098
01:19:59,519 --> 01:20:05,991
the Core Anvil, and whatever decor around it looks
very intimidating. What do you want to do?

1099
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:14,530
MARISHA: The humanoid figure doesn't seem to have
noticed us? He's not moving?

1100
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:18,787
MATT: It's not moving. It's standing there right
at the platform.

1101
01:20:18,787 --> 01:20:20,258
LAURA: Over the anvil?

1102
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:22,552
TRAVIS: Is that sound still happening?

1103
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:23,534
MATT: Yep.

1104
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:27,081
LAURA: And the figure is 20 feet fall, you said?

1105
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:31,783
MATT: Yeah. You don't see the ceiling in here,
because it's all filled with black smoke.

1106
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:35,223
TRAVIS: Can we see the source of the sound? Can we
see what's causing that yet?

1107
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:39,551
MATT: You can't right now. It's behind that
entity, and you see behind where the platform is,

1108
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:50,436
the darkened back portion of the chamber, these
two flashes of spark and flame. As they do, you see

1109
01:20:50,436 --> 01:20:55,707
bursts of smoke and flame billow up and continue
to fill and feed the ceiling.

1110
01:20:55,707 --> 01:21:03,950
MARISHA: I convey what I see. I think you might
have a guardian you have to fight over that

1111
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,209
hammer, Grog.

1112
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:06,543
LAURA: Oh no, again?

1113
01:21:06,543 --> 01:21:13,879
LIAM: I creep up past my sister and place a hand
on his knee, which is in my fucking face.

1114
01:21:13,879 --> 01:21:21,349
MARISHA: If we can take 60 seconds, I back up into
a corner and start casting Conjure Elemental and

1115
01:21:21,349 --> 01:21:26,952
conjure another water elemental to be on our side,
from the staff.

1116
01:21:26,952 --> 01:21:30,412
LAURA: Maybe he's a friendly giant really
creepy-looking entity.

1117
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:35,134
MARISHA: Maybe he's the guy who tried to use the
anvil before.

1118
01:21:35,134 --> 01:21:37,629
LAURA: Maybe he's the Allfather. Is that what he's
called?

1119
01:21:37,629 --> 01:21:39,297
MATT: Allhammer.

1120
01:21:39,297 --> 01:21:43,981
TRAVIS: Well, look. Before we step into that
arena, we control this space. How quick and quiet

1121
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:47,344
can you be, to see if he responds to your
movement?

1122
01:21:47,344 --> 01:21:52,649
LIAM: I can get in there.

1123
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:54,498
LAURA: In and out, super fast.

1124
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:56,353
LIAM: Sure. You want me to get a look?

1125
01:21:56,353 --> 01:21:59,855
TRAVIS: Yeah. See if he reacts to you.

1126
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:04,335
LAURA: Dart up to him and go (taunting) and then
dart back.

1127
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:07,228
MARISHA: Hang on. We might want to be careful
about getting too high. There's a lot of smoke in

1128
01:22:07,228 --> 01:22:09,268
there; we don't want to suffocate.

1129
01:22:09,268 --> 01:22:11,448
SAM: That's the only time Marisha has ever said
those words.

1130
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:20,616
(laughter)

1131
01:22:20,616 --> 01:22:24,283
MARISHA: We're live on the fucking internet, Sam
Riegel!

1132
01:22:24,283 --> 01:22:27,526
SAM: Hope your mom's watching.

1133
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:32,341
LIAM: Thanks for watching everybody, that's the
end of tonight's show. Oh my gosh.

1134
01:22:32,341 --> 01:22:37,955
MATT: What are you guys doing?

1135
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:41,522
LIAM: Can you add any of your secret sauce to my
sneaking?

1136
01:22:41,522 --> 01:22:44,968
MATT: You have to stay within a certain radius of
her to get the effect.

1137
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:46,640
LIAM: Never mind, I'll be fine.

1138
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,991
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it. This is what you do.

1139
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:51,180
LAURA: Just fly in really fast. Be creepy and
quick.

1140
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:54,586
LIAM: Do I need to do an additional stealth?
Creepy is automatic. It's a given.

1141
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:59,407
MATT: Because this is heading into the chamber as
opposed to just staying behind the platform, yes.

1142
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,844
You have to roll again.

1143
01:23:00,844 --> 01:23:02,790
LIAM: Okay. Natural 20.

1144
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:06,487
TALIESIN: We don't even notice him leave.

1145
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:18,719
MATT: So you head into the chamber. Okay. As you
make your way inside, you look left and right and

1146
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:25,386
you can see the dark stonework begins to mingle
with the metal and begins to go into the rough

1147
01:23:25,386 --> 01:23:30,281
edges of the volcanic rock that it's built into.
You see two large pillars to each side of you that

1148
01:23:30,281 --> 01:23:38,293
have these red rocks embedded in the side that
give this faint red glow that gives a hint of

1149
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:45,365
light to the chamber. There's the heat from the
pools. The whole chamber in here is very

1150
01:23:45,365 --> 01:23:50,668
uncomfortable for you. Thankfully, your armor
giving you heat resistance does help a bit. You

1151
01:23:50,668 --> 01:23:58,296
can see the anvil on top of the staircase on the
raised platform and that large hulking entity

1152
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:00,794
that's looming over it at the moment.

1153
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:10,050
LIAM: If he's here and I'm over here, can I fly up
just there so I can see the front of him a bit? The

1154
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:14,679
angle of his face, if there is one, anything to see?
Or is he facing out towards us?

1155
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:16,971
MATT: He's facing out towards you.

1156
01:24:16,971 --> 01:24:21,050
LIAM: Never mind then. Shoot.

1157
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:27,658
LAURA: You've got fuzz on your face. Can I get it?
No, you got it. It was right on his lip, so every

1158
01:24:27,658 --> 01:24:29,493
time he talked--

1159
01:24:29,493 --> 01:24:30,973
LIAM: Nice.

1160
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:32,862
MATT: So what are you doing?

1161
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:35,101
TALIESIN: Be bold.

1162
01:24:35,101 --> 01:24:37,370
LIAM: Float in space and do that.

1163
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:41,207
MATT: Okay. You fly up? That is <i>not</i> stealthy.

1164
01:24:41,207 --> 01:24:46,905
LIAM: No, from where I am. I'm not making noise,
I'm not flying closer to him. I'm just doing this.

1165
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:49,798
Whatever you want to do.

1166
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:54,576
MARISHA: "I stealthily get his attention by waving
my hand in his face."

1167
01:24:54,576 --> 01:25:02,123
MATT: There's a difference between stalking
off in the corner and flying up into the center to

1168
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:07,458
get a look and then seeing if he sees you. So what
are you doing? You have to distinguish that.

1169
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:14,389
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to fly back to the gang.
Could you pick this fuzz off my face? I couldn't

1170
01:25:14,389 --> 01:25:20,918
get it off the whole time, it just keeps
re-affixing. I don't know. I flew in and out.

1171
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:23,296
TALIESIN: We're going to have to get his attention
somehow.

1172
01:25:23,296 --> 01:25:27,703
LAURA: It's got to be you, because you're so
fast. If you get his attention you can dart out

1173
01:25:27,703 --> 01:25:28,806
really fast.

1174
01:25:28,806 --> 01:25:30,889
LIAM: So what do we think we're doing here? Are we
talking to this thing?

1175
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,004
LAURA: Should we try talking to him?

1176
01:25:32,004 --> 01:25:32,894
TRAVIS: We might.

1177
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:33,934
LAURA: Maybe it's better.

1178
01:25:33,934 --> 01:25:35,940
TALIESIN: It's a crazy plan, but it just might
work.

1179
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:38,333
LAURA: You can speak Celestial, too, right? You
don't just read it.

1180
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:42,805
TALIESIN: Gefülten. Yes, I speak Celestial.

1181
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:43,938
(laughs)

1182
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:45,891
TRAVIS: Oh man, Swedish Chef over here.

1183
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:53,866
MATT: So we now have, as Exandria canon, that
Celestial sounds like Swedish.

1184
01:25:53,866 --> 01:25:56,577
TALIESIN: You can bury that as deep as you want.

1185
01:25:56,577 --> 01:25:58,309
MATT: Thank you for that, Taliesin.

1186
01:25:58,309 --> 01:26:01,893
LAURA: I thought Celestial sounded more like
singing.

1187
01:26:01,893 --> 01:26:04,334
TALIESIN: Well, you know, it's like a whole thing.

1188
01:26:04,334 --> 01:26:07,382
LIAM: Can I get another quick re-rundown of the
room? So he was up at the top of the stairs,

1189
01:26:07,382 --> 01:26:12,648
facing out, not moving and was that
wall behind him, or does it go further past him at all?

1190
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:20,843
MATT: I'd say about 15 feet behind him you can see
the occasional reflection of the flashes of light,

1191
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:24,068
where it looks to be there is a wall behind
him. There is an end to the chamber, but you're

1192
01:26:24,068 --> 01:26:30,710
too far away and it's too obscured by smoke for
you to know exactly what's behind him.

1193
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:33,979
LIAM: And when I got in there, I didn't get close
enough to see if there was any good hiding spots

1194
01:26:33,979 --> 01:26:35,185
beyond him?

1195
01:26:35,185 --> 01:26:37,725
MATT: Make a perception check.

1196
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,734
LIAM: 24.

1197
01:26:40,734 --> 01:26:48,869
MATT: 24. There are corners to the chamber. As
you fly up and glance you can see two more small

1198
01:26:48,914 --> 01:27:01,164
equal-sized pits of coals, behind him on either
side, and you do glance, two 20-foot-wide domed

1199
01:27:01,164 --> 01:27:08,873
machines that you see the flame and the billowing
smoke are being pushed out of. It's a weird

1200
01:27:08,873 --> 01:27:17,140
engine-like structure with two of them behind it,
that you can see the flames. (hammering) And

1201
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,571
that's where the sparks are shooting out of each
time.

1202
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:23,464
LIAM: Do the talking thing, I'm going to go back
in.

1203
01:27:23,464 --> 01:27:28,895
MARISHA: Before we start, how long has it been
since we entered this chamber?

1204
01:27:28,895 --> 01:27:32,071
MATT: It's been maybe ten minutes.

1205
01:27:32,071 --> 01:27:34,094
MARISHA: Entered into the volcano.

1206
01:27:34,094 --> 01:27:35,398
MATT: Oh, into the volcano?

1207
01:27:35,398 --> 01:27:39,221
MARISHA: Yeah, entered into the first forge room.
I'm trying to find out if Freedom of Movement is

1208
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:40,177
still on.

1209
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:44,503
MATT: Okay, with all of the smelting, put together
I'd say it's probably been close to an hour.

1210
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:55,164
MARISHA: Can I only have one condition effect on
him? Or can I stack them up?

1211
01:27:55,164 --> 01:27:59,820
MATT: You can have as many as you put on him. If
they're not concentration, you can stack as many

1212
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,978
as you want.

1213
01:28:00,978 --> 01:28:03,858
MARISHA: Okay, Freedom of Movement is not. I'm
going to cast Freedom of Movement on you again,

1214
01:28:03,858 --> 01:28:11,816
and then I think Enhance Ability is, though, so
I'm going to use my concentration to give you

1215
01:28:11,816 --> 01:28:17,800
Cat's Grace, right? You were using dexterity for
the smelting?

1216
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,287
TRAVIS: Yeah, on that one.

1217
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:23,298
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's would be dex or strength.

1218
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,467
MATT: For most blacksmithing, you gather that it
will be dex or strength.

1219
01:28:27,467 --> 01:28:29,452
TRAVIS: Well, strength is way better than dex.

1220
01:28:29,452 --> 01:28:31,816
MARISHA: Then I'll give you Cat's Grace. You have
advantage on dex checks.

1221
01:28:31,816 --> 01:28:37,568
LIAM: And DM. How long were we in this room?

1222
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:41,079
MATT: In that room? Since you entered that chamber
it's been about an hour.

1223
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:43,263
LIAM: It's been an hour? My wings then are--

1224
01:28:43,263 --> 01:28:45,681
MATT: At this point, yeah, your wings have now
dissipated.

1225
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:48,702
TRAVIS: Percy, I'm not afraid, go talk to this
thing.

1226
01:28:48,702 --> 01:28:54,575
TALIESIN: In Celestial, I'm going to say hello.
I'm going to say it out.

1227
01:28:54,575 --> 01:28:56,990
MATT: You shout it into the chamber?

1228
01:28:56,990 --> 01:29:12,275
TALIESIN: Hello? We come seeking the Allhammer. We
need help. Vecna walks the earth again. We come

1229
01:29:12,275 --> 01:29:15,975
seeking a way to defeat him once again.

1230
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:18,621
LAURA: Tell him we were sent by Pelor.

1231
01:29:18,621 --> 01:29:26,744
TALIESIN: We come with the blessings of Pelor. And
I'm going to start entering, very gingerly.

1232
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:28,390
TRAVIS: I'm right behind you.

1233
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,292
MATT: Okay. So Percival is entering--

1234
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:36,899
LIAM: Actually, I'll throw out that I crept back
in ahead of that, so in there, hiding.

1235
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:40,532
LAURA: I'm floating behind him on a broom.

1236
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:43,216
MATT: All righty. Scanlan, where are you coming in
on this?

1237
01:29:43,216 --> 01:29:47,313
SAM: I will lag behind Grog.

1238
01:29:47,313 --> 01:29:52,337
MATT: So we have Percival walking in, and who is
right behind Percival?

1239
01:29:52,337 --> 01:29:53,426
TALIESIN: Grog.

1240
01:29:53,426 --> 01:29:56,033
MATT: Grog, all righty. Scanlan right behind
Grog.

1241
01:29:56,033 --> 01:29:59,141
LAURA: Does it have to be single file with this?

1242
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:00,568
MATT: No, it doesn't.

1243
01:30:00,568 --> 01:30:03,759
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to be back over to the
side of Scanlan.

1244
01:30:03,759 --> 01:30:06,104
MATT: All right. Keyleth?

1245
01:30:06,104 --> 01:30:07,900
MARISHA: I'll take up the rears with my water
elemental.

1246
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,999
LAURA: The ground is still super duper hot,
right?

1247
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:19,245
MATT: The ground is, yes. All righty. So as you
begin to enter the chamber and make your way

1248
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:25,631
towards the stairway and this central, raised
platform with the two flaming pillars that flank

1249
01:30:25,631 --> 01:30:34,684
it. Shouting this into the chamber, it echoes
through, and you still hear the (hammering). Each

1250
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:41,117
flash of light causes this faint glow across your
faces and the faces of your companions as their

1251
01:30:41,117 --> 01:30:48,332
shapes go from dark obscured in the shadow and
smoke into a brief reveal of your form. As you

1252
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:57,839
begin to approach the stairs, you hear this faint
grinding of stone as the faceless giant's head

1253
01:30:57,839 --> 01:31:01,802
slowly looks up to face you. But that's all.

1254
01:31:01,802 --> 01:31:04,769
TALIESIN: I keep walking.

1255
01:31:04,769 --> 01:31:06,642
TRAVIS: Me, too.

1256
01:31:06,642 --> 01:31:12,988
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue to walk, you get
to the bottom of the stairs, and you watch as one

1257
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:18,995
of its hands on the side that clutches the hammer
unfurls and releases it and the hammer, once let

1258
01:31:18,995 --> 01:31:28,134
go, swings, the chain going taut and it slams into
the side of the raised platform out of sight and

1259
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:33,712
as it does, it stands up and rights itself, but
its head is still looking down at you, Percival.

1260
01:31:33,712 --> 01:31:40,748
TALIESIN: We ask permission to use the anvil.

1261
01:31:40,748 --> 01:31:51,561
LAURA: Tell him, nod yes. Once for yes and shake
his head no.

1262
01:31:51,561 --> 01:32:00,038
TRAVIS: How about this? I'm not afraid. If he
takes offense, I'll take it better than most.

1263
01:32:00,038 --> 01:32:01,549
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1264
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:03,678
MATT: So do you ascend the stairs?

1265
01:32:03,678 --> 01:32:05,624
TRAVIS: I am in the front now.

1266
01:32:05,624 --> 01:32:12,684
MATT: Grog has now moved to the front. All right.
And you take your first couple steps onto the

1267
01:32:12,684 --> 01:32:23,254
stairs. As you do, the large stone entity spins
around and steps into the smoke that obscures its

1268
01:32:23,254 --> 01:32:24,341
shoulders--

1269
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:27,375
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself one
more time, while this is happening.

1270
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:34,903
LIAM: I'm going to down a potion. And then a quick
question, too. Hunter's Mark has a duration of an

1271
01:32:34,903 --> 01:32:39,892
hour, but since that last battle lapsed, am I then
not allowed to slide it to this guy?

1272
01:32:39,892 --> 01:32:44,285
MATT: No, it's gone now. It has been more time-- the
process of smelting and then re-smelting and

1273
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:48,479
figuring out and adjusting everything, it has
taken over an hour, sorry.

1274
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:52,606
TRAVIS: Can I use my Second Wind? Just because.

1275
01:32:52,606 --> 01:32:54,173
MATT: Sure.

1276
01:32:54,173 --> 01:33:07,081
TALIESIN: Man, I could really use Spider Climb
right now, goddamn it.

1277
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,845
TRAVIS: Heal 13 points.

1278
01:33:08,845 --> 01:33:12,070
MATT: All righty. So as you continue to step up
the stairs. Grog, as you approach, you get about a

1279
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:22,251
third of the way up there and you hear what sounds
like heavy metal scraping against stone and one

1280
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:31,041
giant burst of sound. You watch as the giant
figure shifts and turns back out of the smoke,

1281
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:39,812
holding across its front in one hand a large
cleaver-like blade with runes glowing across the

1282
01:33:39,812 --> 01:33:49,629
side of it. About 15 feet or so from end to end,
and as it spins, it looks down towards you all and

1283
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:54,878
holds it in front, the flat end facing out towards
you in a ceremonial way.

1284
01:33:54,878 --> 01:33:56,698
TALIESIN: What kind of runes?

1285
01:33:56,698 --> 01:33:58,875
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1286
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:05,802
LAURA: Maybe if you use it the right way, it will
be fine.

1287
01:34:05,802 --> 01:34:07,403
TALIESIN: 11.

1288
01:34:07,403 --> 01:34:08,840
MATT: You have no idea.

1289
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:09,951
TALIESIN: Okay.

1290
01:34:09,951 --> 01:34:12,952
MARISHA: Are they runes or a language? Is it a
script?

1291
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:24,516
MATT: These are specifically arcane runes of an
enchantment-type nature. It's holding the blade

1292
01:34:24,516 --> 01:34:29,368
out in front like that, clutching the handle on
one side and putting its hand against the flat of

1293
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:31,163
the blade in the other.

1294
01:34:31,163 --> 01:34:33,193
TALIESIN: Do we have our bits of god?

1295
01:34:33,193 --> 01:34:34,360
LAURA: Yeah.

1296
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,486
TALIESIN: We might want to have them available for
the moment.

1297
01:34:37,486 --> 01:34:39,943
LAURA: Yeah. I take mine out of my pocket.

1298
01:34:39,943 --> 01:34:46,127
MATT: So Grog, go up to the top? You make it to
the very top of the stairs, and there is the anvil

1299
01:34:46,127 --> 01:34:53,725
there before you, and the heat you can feel. You
know when you're close to an explosion and there's

1300
01:34:53,725 --> 01:34:59,846
that brief minute of extremely uncomfortable
heat that you flinch? It's that, perpetually and

1301
01:34:59,846 --> 01:35:06,253
all of you are sweating masses beneath your
armor. You're afraid at certain points that your

1302
01:35:06,253 --> 01:35:12,845
eyebrows are beginning to singe and curl. It's
hard to breathe because the air is so hot and so

1303
01:35:12,845 --> 01:35:18,859
thick, and occasionally you can't help but find
yourself coughing at the caustic black smoke that

1304
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:21,384
fills a large portion of the chamber.

1305
01:35:21,384 --> 01:35:22,827
TRAVIS: I am consciously checking my beard.

1306
01:35:22,827 --> 01:35:30,778
MATT: Okay. As you approach the top of the stairs,
the head looks down at you. What do you do?

1307
01:35:30,778 --> 01:35:33,829
TRAVIS: Am I standing at the anvil now?

1308
01:35:33,829 --> 01:35:36,885
MATT: You're standing right at the edge of the
stairs, the very top of the platform, and the

1309
01:35:36,885 --> 01:35:40,917
anvil's maybe five feet in front of you. You can
see all the chains that are hanging on the side

1310
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:43,002
and dangling off the sides of the platform.

1311
01:35:43,002 --> 01:35:45,967
TRAVIS: Can I see where the chains are leading or
are they just dangling off?

1312
01:35:45,967 --> 01:35:52,771
MATT: The platform is about 20 feet wide and so
the chains that are all hooked at multiple places

1313
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:56,685
to the edges and the outside part of the anvil are
taut and then dangling off the edge of the

1314
01:35:56,685 --> 01:35:59,769
platform. So you can't see where it goes. You know
one of them is the hammer, because that's what he

1315
01:35:59,769 --> 01:36:01,260
let fly off the side.

1316
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,565
TALIESIN: I kept track of which one was the
hammer.

1317
01:36:03,565 --> 01:36:05,096
TRAVIS: Give me the platinum.

1318
01:36:05,153 --> 01:36:06,245
LAURA: Okay.

1319
01:36:06,245 --> 01:36:18,020
TRAVIS: Well, put it together first, please.
Thanks. With the platinum, I will approach the

1320
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:19,118
anvil.

1321
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:25,023
MATT: Okay. You step up to the edge of the anvil.
As it does, the blade tilts so that now, as

1322
01:36:25,023 --> 01:36:28,841
opposed to the flat facing you, one of the two
bladed edges is now--

1323
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:36,977
TRAVIS: I stop.

1324
01:36:36,977 --> 01:36:43,133
LAURA: In your vision of how to do it, did you see
this guy?

1325
01:36:43,133 --> 01:36:55,561
TRAVIS: Did I? No. Do I see any blacksmithing
tools, anything that I would use to hammer this?

1326
01:36:55,561 --> 01:36:57,607
LAURA: The hammer that he let go of.

1327
01:36:57,607 --> 01:36:59,924
TRAVIS: Oh, that's hanging off?

1328
01:36:59,924 --> 01:37:05,193
MATT: You saw that, but you didn't get a great
look at it by the time it was chucked off the side.

1329
01:37:05,193 --> 01:37:13,753
TRAVIS: Flat. Edge. That does feel like a ready,
set.

1330
01:37:13,753 --> 01:37:16,138
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

1331
01:37:16,138 --> 01:37:20,248
TRAVIS: I take one step back.

1332
01:37:20,248 --> 01:37:23,891
MATT: The blade goes to a flat.

1333
01:37:23,891 --> 01:37:31,607
MARISHA: So next, after the edge, is
decapitation.

1334
01:37:31,607 --> 01:37:36,332
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure that would be 150 points
of damage.

1335
01:37:36,332 --> 01:37:43,752
LAURA: What if you go and try to pick up that
hammer first? Do you need it?

1336
01:37:43,752 --> 01:37:48,583
TRAVIS: I'm picturing the anvil right in front of
me and he's off to the side, right?

1337
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:54,490
MATT: The anvil is right in front of you. He's on
the other side of the anvil. You only see the

1338
01:37:54,490 --> 01:38:01,393
upper part of the torso because he's standing off
the platform below it. So you see him from the waist

1339
01:38:01,393 --> 01:38:06,924
up; he's about 20 feet tall from top to bottom,
you only see ten feet of his torso there. The

1340
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:08,706
blade's out in front.

1341
01:38:08,706 --> 01:38:12,277
TRAVIS: And the hammer is somewhere between me and
him?

1342
01:38:12,277 --> 01:38:17,279
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check to see if you
remember which chain it was.

1343
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:20,097
TRAVIS: Seven.

1344
01:38:20,097 --> 01:38:24,998
MATT: There's four chains on each side that are dangling
off the side, and you are not sure which one it is.

1345
01:38:24,998 --> 01:38:26,385
TRAVIS: Oh, it went hanging off.

1346
01:38:26,385 --> 01:38:29,103
MATT: It went held off the side, so now there
are four chains that are taut on each side of the

1347
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:30,974
anvil that are vanishing.

1348
01:38:30,974 --> 01:38:32,917
TALIESIN: Is he another golem?

1349
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:38,054
MATT: It looks to be a golem-like construct, yeah.
You have seen golems and you have encountered

1350
01:38:38,054 --> 01:38:44,686
golems before, and the constructs of them can
vary. This one, elements of it have the same

1351
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:49,218
proportions of a golem, but there are elements
that seem more human-like as opposed to an armored

1352
01:38:49,218 --> 01:39:01,405
battering ram. The refined details of it-- no,
your perception roll isn't high enough and you're

1353
01:39:01,405 --> 01:39:04,039
too far away to make out much more of its form.

1354
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:08,073
LAURA: Is his sword as big as our table is
across?

1355
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:11,171
SAM: Oh, what if we show him one of our little
beans?

1356
01:39:11,171 --> 01:39:13,091
LAURA: Well, I pulled mine out.

1357
01:39:13,091 --> 01:39:19,909
SAM: Maybe you have to show him how good a
blacksmith you are to earn the privilege.

1358
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:22,506
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I've got to get to the anvil to
do that.

1359
01:39:22,506 --> 01:39:29,482
MATT: Yeah, the blade in his hand, just the blade
from hilt to end is about 15 feet long.

1360
01:39:29,482 --> 01:39:37,075
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you read the arcane runes on
his sword? Do you know what this enchantment is?

1361
01:39:37,075 --> 01:39:38,863
SAM: I can certainly try.

1362
01:39:38,863 --> 01:39:44,683
MATT: Make an arcana check, Scanlan, as you glance
over, stepping into the edge of the stairs.

1363
01:39:44,683 --> 01:39:46,035
MARISHA: Can I help him?

1364
01:39:46,035 --> 01:39:48,304
MATT: No, it's purely based on his knowledge.

1365
01:39:48,304 --> 01:39:50,229
LAURA: You've got this Scanlan! Come on!

1366
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:51,464
SAM: This is arcana?

1367
01:39:51,464 --> 01:39:52,429
MATT: Yes.

1368
01:39:52,429 --> 01:39:55,607
LIAM: Come on, vacation Scanlan.

1369
01:39:55,607 --> 01:39:57,381
SAM: It's a 21.

1370
01:39:57,381 --> 01:40:09,313
MATT: 21. The runes across the blade specifically
deal with cursing the physical form of what

1371
01:40:09,313 --> 01:40:10,880
touches its blade.

1372
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:19,073
TRAVIS: Shit. Okay, cool. Instead of walking
towards the anvil, can I start walking to the

1373
01:40:19,073 --> 01:40:25,902
right, towards one of those chains that's dangling
on?

1374
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:29,255
MATT: The chains are immediately to the left and
right of the anvil, so to go towards the chain

1375
01:40:29,255 --> 01:40:33,860
you'd be stepping closer to the anvil, and as you
turn to the side its head tracks you as you go.

1376
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:36,655
TRAVIS: Is it tilting it down?

1377
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:38,578
MATT: You haven't moved forward, so no.

1378
01:40:38,578 --> 01:40:40,680
TRAVIS: Okay. Can I keep moving in that
direction?

1379
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:45,358
MATT: Okay, you begin to step forward towards the
chain. The blade comes down to a flat end towards you.

1380
01:40:45,358 --> 01:40:46,997
TRAVIS: I'll stop.

1381
01:40:46,997 --> 01:40:52,227
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and sneak around the
side of it. What's behind it?

1382
01:40:52,227 --> 01:40:57,945
MATT: Make a perception check.

1383
01:40:57,945 --> 01:41:01,890
TALIESIN: 19.

1384
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:07,252
MATT: Okay. Glancing over, what you can see between
the smoke, you see the two pits of burning coals

1385
01:41:07,252 --> 01:41:13,445
to the-- behind, right and left of it, with small steps that
lead into the coals on each side and you see the

1386
01:41:13,445 --> 01:41:21,470
two edges of these large, cylindrical turbines of
stone and metal where the impacts are and the

1387
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:23,488
flames flickering off it.

1388
01:41:23,488 --> 01:41:26,477
TALIESIN: Are those bellows or is it more
complicated?

1389
01:41:26,477 --> 01:41:29,462
MATT: You're not sure. A lot of it is obscured
from the smoke that's spilling out of it and you're

1390
01:41:29,462 --> 01:41:32,248
too far and the light's too dark in here,
from that distance.

1391
01:41:32,312 --> 01:41:35,087
TALIESIN: What would happen if we put that machine
out?

1392
01:41:35,087 --> 01:41:40,118
LAURA: Well, it's not like you can step up to the
anvil before the metal's hot anyway, right? So

1393
01:41:40,118 --> 01:41:46,531
maybe we're stepping up to the anvil too soon.
Maybe you have to heat the metal first?

1394
01:41:46,531 --> 01:41:53,012
TALIESIN: I think that it feels like a guardian.
What if we put the water elemental in the--

1395
01:41:53,012 --> 01:41:57,536
MARISHA: I was just going to say. I'm going to
come into the room a little bit.

1396
01:41:57,536 --> 01:42:04,294
MATT: Okay. So you step in. Most of you are 
at the base of the stairs. Grog is at the top of

1397
01:42:04,294 --> 01:42:10,405
the stairs. Scanlan stepped up behind him to look
at the runes on the blade. That's where you

1398
01:42:10,405 --> 01:42:11,881
currently reside.

1399
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:13,725
MARISHA: Is his eyesight still trained on Grog?

1400
01:42:13,725 --> 01:42:14,958
MATT: Correct.

1401
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:18,481
MARISHA: I'm going to send my water elemental
forward and see if it attracts its attention,

1402
01:42:18,481 --> 01:42:20,480
since it's not a mortal.

1403
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,757
MATT: Where do you send it?

1404
01:42:21,757 --> 01:42:23,095
MARISHA: Towards the anvil.

1405
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,887
MATT: Okay. So you head up the stairs. The water
elemental swarms around the side. You see wherever

1406
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:32,534
it moves forward there's steam pouring off from
the heat of the ground and the surrounding metal

1407
01:42:32,534 --> 01:42:37,978
and stone. As it comes up the steps, more and more
steam (sizzling) emerging off the back of its

1408
01:42:37,978 --> 01:42:43,320
body, it comes to the top and it's now next to
Grog. You send it towards the anvil?

1409
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:47,229
MARISHA: Yeah, but didn't Grog train to the
right?

1410
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:50,775
MATT: Grog stepped to the right and then began to
step forward and then stopped.

1411
01:42:50,775 --> 01:42:54,318
MARISHA: Does the water elemental seem to be
catching its attention at all, or is it still

1412
01:42:54,318 --> 01:42:55,372
looking at Grog?

1413
01:42:55,372 --> 01:42:56,732
MATT: It's still looking at Grog.

1414
01:42:56,732 --> 01:42:59,707
MARISHA: Can I move the elemental to the left to
see if it follows the elemental?

1415
01:42:59,707 --> 01:43:02,040
MATT: Okay, the elemental moves to the left. It
doesn't follow the elemental.

1416
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,268
LAURA: I wouldn't send him any closer to the
anvil, though.

1417
01:43:06,268 --> 01:43:08,613
TRAVIS: Well, he might swing at the thing if it
got closer.

1418
01:43:08,613 --> 01:43:10,600
MARISHA: That's what I'm wondering.

1419
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,755
LAURA: It might send him in attack mode.

1420
01:43:12,755 --> 01:43:19,776
TRAVIS: So unless we're short on ideas, we might
have to starburst this thing. Scatter it.

1421
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:23,467
SAM: Who forged here before? What god?

1422
01:43:23,467 --> 01:43:25,133
MATT: The Allhammer.

1423
01:43:25,133 --> 01:43:27,963
TRAVIS: Ioun helped, Pelor helped.

1424
01:43:27,963 --> 01:43:33,329
SAM: Well, should we show our god shit? Did we do
that yet?

1425
01:43:33,329 --> 01:43:37,400
LAURA: Well, yeah, I'm going to fly up next to
Grog, but I'm not going to go past him, and I'm

1426
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,642
going to hold up the little bead of power.

1427
01:43:39,642 --> 01:43:45,707
MATT: Okay. His attention focuses in between the
two of you. Doesn't change his stance; the blade

1428
01:43:45,707 --> 01:43:47,650
is still tilted down towards you.

1429
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:53,983
LAURA: I'm going to step one step forward with it,
no further than Grog stepped that first time.

1430
01:43:53,983 --> 01:43:58,270
MATT: Right, yeah. The blade is still turned
towards you. Doesn't seem to react.

1431
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:02,964
LAURA: All right, I back up. Fuck!

1432
01:44:02,964 --> 01:44:04,754
TRAVIS: You thinkers better think.

1433
01:44:04,754 --> 01:44:11,465
TALIESIN: I want to put the engineering behind it
out. I want to put those pistons out.

1434
01:44:11,465 --> 01:44:17,202
MARISHA: But what if the pistons are fueling the
fires, the forge?

1435
01:44:17,202 --> 01:44:23,762
TRAVIS: We still can't see what's sending up
those?

1436
01:44:23,762 --> 01:44:27,663
MATT: You're not close enough, and you don't have
a far enough view. It's blocking the bulk of it.

1437
01:44:27,663 --> 01:44:30,013
LAURA: I'm going to fly to the side against the
wall.

1438
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:31,538
TRAVIS: What about an Oracle Arrow?

1439
01:44:31,538 --> 01:44:33,544
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was going to do, so I
could shoot it around.

1440
01:44:33,544 --> 01:44:37,586
MATT: Okay. So you fly off to the side of the
chamber.

1441
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:41,397
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm going to shoot an oracle
arrow behind him to see what's going on over there.

1442
01:44:41,465 --> 01:44:49,929
MATT: Okay. You go and fire the arrow just past
him. As you do, his head darts with the speed of

1443
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:55,253
the arrow as it clacks against the back of the
wall. Without even looking towards you, this hand

1444
01:44:55,253 --> 01:45:01,829
releases the blade and the blade swings a wide arc
about a foot above your head, Grog. (whoosh) Slams

1445
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:06,144
something in the back of the wall out of sight.
You hear what sounds like a heavy chain snapping

1446
01:45:06,144 --> 01:45:12,491
and falling to the ground and the wall behind you
where you entered the chamber (crash) slams shut.

1447
01:45:12,491 --> 01:45:22,009
As you all hear the sound and take in the scenery,
you watch as it retracts the blade into an

1448
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:28,473
offensive position, and we're going to take a
break. We'll be back here in just a moment, guys.

1449
01:45:28,473 --> 01:45:30,911
We have a giveaway.

1450
01:45:30,911 --> 01:45:33,876
LAURA: I wasn't even shooting at him!

1451
01:45:33,876 --> 01:45:40,213
LIAM: That's all right. We did our due diligence.
We poked it and we prodded it.

1452
01:45:40,213 --> 01:45:47,896
MATT: This is a big package going out to a bunch
of folks there. It's the complete black poisonwood

1453
01:45:47,896 --> 01:45:55,261
set, which is awesome. It's the tray, the vault,
the dice tower. Oh god, it's all falling. It might

1454
01:45:55,261 --> 01:45:57,225
be a little broken; I apologize in advance.

1455
01:45:57,225 --> 01:45:59,697
SAM: It smells of coffee.

1456
01:45:59,697 --> 01:46:06,301
MATT: Exactly. That's what it looks like. It's
going to be signed by the cast for you. So to be

1457
01:46:06,301 --> 01:46:11,447
entered in that giveaway, come into the Twitch
chat over the break, and the keyword is going to

1458
01:46:11,447 --> 01:46:19,620
be tarot. T-A-R-O-T. So yeah, we'll all be back
here in a few minutes, guys. Enjoy your break, and

1459
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:21,402
we'll see you in a minute.

1460
01:46:21,402 --> 02:11:50,806
[break]

1461
02:11:50,806 --> 02:11:55,685
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical
Role. So! First and foremost, our winner in the

1462
02:11:55,685 --> 02:12:05,028
chat of the awesome collection of various Wyrmwood
collectables is ProfessorJedi. Congratulations,

1463
02:12:05,028 --> 02:12:10,382
ProfessorJedi. Danoba will contact you and get
your information to get those to you ASAP. So

1464
02:12:10,382 --> 02:12:11,608
congrats.

1465
02:12:11,608 --> 02:12:15,308
MARISHA: Also, I've been flooded with tweets on
where I got this shirt.

1466
02:12:15,308 --> 02:12:16,502
LIAM: It's the best shirt.

1467
02:12:16,502 --> 02:12:18,405
TALIESIN: And I was wearing it yesterday.

1468
02:12:18,405 --> 02:12:20,699
MARISHA: You were wearing it yesterday. The
amazing Whitney Moore made it.

1469
02:12:20,773 --> 02:12:22,722
LIAM: This very shirt? This one?

1470
02:12:22,722 --> 02:12:28,427
TALIESIN: A more masculine cut of this exact
shirt. Not that exact shirt, but another one very

1471
02:12:28,427 --> 02:12:29,399
similar to it.

1472
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:31,707
MARISHA: Although we do have a few shirts that we
share and trade off.

1473
02:12:31,707 --> 02:12:33,326
LAURA: Tell us where to get it.

1474
02:12:33,326 --> 02:12:36,292
MARISHA: For Human Peoples! I just tweeted it
out.

1475
02:12:36,292 --> 02:12:39,509
TALIESIN: You can get a pin, you can get a hoodie,
you can get any form you want.

1476
02:12:39,509 --> 02:12:41,758
LIAM: I know you, so I'll ask you later, too.

1477
02:12:41,758 --> 02:12:43,157
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

1478
02:12:43,157 --> 02:12:56,327
MATT: All right, then. So last we left off, you
had made your way into the chamber that holds the

1479
02:12:56,327 --> 02:13:01,953
Core Anvil beneath the underwater volcano of
Scaldseat. Upon approaching the central risen

1480
02:13:01,953 --> 02:13:09,502
platform where the anvil was, some stone-built
guardian that loomed over it, upon approaching and

1481
02:13:09,502 --> 02:13:14,893
testing the boundaries, an unintentional firing
of an arrow in the vicinity seemed to have

1482
02:13:14,893 --> 02:13:21,462
triggered an aggressive stance, and the entity
seems to be on the assault. So now, with the

1483
02:13:21,462 --> 02:13:25,657
chamber there before you, I would like you all to
take stock on your current positions and roll

1484
02:13:25,657 --> 02:13:26,974
initiative.

1485
02:13:26,974 --> 02:13:31,643
LIAM: He's going to hit you like he is at a
driving range!

1486
02:13:31,643 --> 02:13:33,363
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, like tee-ball.

1487
02:13:33,363 --> 02:13:35,817
MARISHA: I'm also rolling for my elemental.

1488
02:13:35,817 --> 02:13:42,341
TRAVIS: Oh, that's really unfortunate. I get
advantage on those, and that was terrible.

1489
02:13:42,341 --> 02:13:46,230
MATT: All righty. So 25 to 20?

1490
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:47,268
TALIESIN: 24.

1491
02:13:47,268 --> 02:13:50,827
LIAM: 20. Jeez.

1492
02:13:50,827 --> 02:13:55,084
MATT: All righty. 20 to 15?

1493
02:13:55,084 --> 02:13:58,806
TRAVIS: 20 to 15? For the love of god?

1494
02:13:58,806 --> 02:14:01,997
MATT: Okay. 15 to ten?

1495
02:14:01,997 --> 02:14:03,145
LAURA: 14.

1496
02:14:03,145 --> 02:14:04,201
SAM: 12.

1497
02:14:04,201 --> 02:14:06,189
MARISHA: 11 for my elemental.

1498
02:14:06,189 --> 02:14:07,645
TALIESIN: What?

1499
02:14:07,645 --> 02:14:09,447
MARISHA: 11 for my elemental.

1500
02:14:09,447 --> 02:14:11,337
TALIESIN: You're not? Okay.

1501
02:14:11,337 --> 02:14:13,670
MATT: Ten to five?

1502
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:16,328
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Six.

1503
02:14:16,328 --> 02:14:18,634
TALIESIN: Oh. Six?

1504
02:14:18,634 --> 02:14:22,030
LAURA: We are fucked!

1505
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:33,690
MATT: Top of the round. As the large forge
guardian stands with its giant rune blade before

1506
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:38,072
it, Percival. You're up first. What are you
doing?

1507
02:14:38,072 --> 02:14:40,089
LAURA: Make peace!

1508
02:14:40,089 --> 02:14:43,373
(laughter)

1509
02:14:43,373 --> 02:14:45,475
TRAVIS: When the DM smirks like that.

1510
02:14:45,475 --> 02:14:52,801
TALIESIN: I'm going to bake a pie and deliver it--
okay, I'm going to run back towards that red

1511
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:53,760
crystal.

1512
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,197
MATT: This one?

1513
02:14:55,197 --> 02:15:08,384
TALIESIN: Yep. I run that direction, and then I'm
going to use my bonus action to do that. I'm going

1514
02:15:08,384 --> 02:15:11,725
to hold my attack until his attack.

1515
02:15:11,725 --> 02:15:17,622
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that ends
Percival's turn, holding his action to attack when

1516
02:15:17,622 --> 02:15:19,190
it attacks. Vax, you're up.

1517
02:15:19,190 --> 02:15:29,275
LIAM: Oh jeez. You know what, I tell you what I'm
going to do. I'm going to run over right next to

1518
02:15:29,275 --> 02:15:30,308
Keyleth.

1519
02:15:30,308 --> 02:15:37,981
MATT: All righty. 20, 25, 30. That's about as far
as you can get on regular movement.

1520
02:15:37,981 --> 02:15:47,354
LIAM: Right. I know what I want to do here. Is
Percy within 30 feet of me?

1521
02:15:47,354 --> 02:15:48,999
MATT: Percy is, yes.

1522
02:15:48,999 --> 02:15:57,315
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to cast Bless on Scanlan,
Keyleth, and Percy.

1523
02:15:57,315 --> 02:15:58,607
MATT: Okay.

1524
02:15:58,607 --> 02:16:00,447
SAM: What does that do?

1525
02:16:00,447 --> 02:16:03,387
LAURA: Obviously doesn't give a shit about me any
more.

1526
02:16:03,387 --> 02:16:05,893
MARISHA: Well, you stole the boots.

1527
02:16:05,893 --> 02:16:07,714
LAURA: I gave them back!

1528
02:16:07,714 --> 02:16:17,064
LIAM: You're so capable. You bless up to three
creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a

1529
02:16:17,064 --> 02:16:21,684
target makes an attack roll or a saving throw
before this spell ends, the target can roll a d4

1530
02:16:21,684 --> 02:16:25,312
and add the number. So you three.

1531
02:16:25,312 --> 02:16:26,583
MARISHA: Attack roll or saving throw?

1532
02:16:26,583 --> 02:16:31,415
MATT: Yes, you can add a d4 to it. Your movement
and your action?

1533
02:16:31,415 --> 02:16:44,336
LIAM: That's my action. I have a bonus action.
This is an intimidating map, Matt. I am going to

1534
02:16:44,336 --> 02:16:50,317
roll backward and sit underneath my sister and her
judgemental ass.

1535
02:16:50,317 --> 02:16:52,960
MATT: Okay. So you're going to dash over under
her?

1536
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:54,074
LIAM: Yep.

1537
02:16:54,074 --> 02:16:55,807
MATT: There you go.

1538
02:16:55,807 --> 02:16:57,869
LAURA: Top of my turn, I'm going to fart.

1539
02:16:57,869 --> 02:16:59,914
MATT: (chuckles) It's how she propels the broom.

1540
02:16:59,914 --> 02:17:05,230
MARISHA: It immediately catches your butt on fire
because we're surrounded by methane gas. You take

1541
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:06,323
four damage.

1542
02:17:06,323 --> 02:17:08,109
LAURA: And you're on fire.

1543
02:17:08,109 --> 02:17:10,285
MARISHA: And you're on fire, yeah.

1544
02:17:10,285 --> 02:17:16,300
TALIESIN: This is really intimidating. The
crystals are glowing, and it makes me unhappy. Is

1545
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,841
your crystal red, too?

1546
02:17:17,841 --> 02:17:19,522
(gasping)

1547
02:17:19,522 --> 02:17:21,139
TALIESIN: No! Not cool.

1548
02:17:21,139 --> 02:17:22,287
LAURA: He can walk! He can move!

1549
02:17:22,287 --> 02:17:23,865
MATT: Steps, leaps--

1550
02:17:23,865 --> 02:17:28,206
LIAM: Fuck yourself! Wow!

1551
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:30,710
MATT: It lands in the center.

1552
02:17:30,710 --> 02:17:32,979
TRAVIS: Look at him winding up. This is awful.

1553
02:17:32,979 --> 02:17:38,478
MATT: With his legs down, straddling the two sides
of this, and he's going to go into a blade storm,

1554
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:41,590
and spins around in a wide arc.

1555
02:17:41,590 --> 02:17:47,237
TALIESIN: Okay. So if he's going to do this, I was
holding my attack. I'm taking my attack now right

1556
02:17:47,237 --> 02:17:49,843
before this happens. He has no face, does he?

1557
02:17:49,843 --> 02:17:51,800
MATT: Currently, you do not see a face, no.

1558
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:55,407
TALIESIN: There's no face. So if I were to make a
head attack, that would probably be really goddamn

1559
02:17:55,407 --> 02:17:58,641
useless. One way to find out.

1560
02:17:58,641 --> 02:18:01,387
MARISHA: Well, he has a head. You can have a face
and not a head.

1561
02:18:01,387 --> 02:18:04,316
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Maybe it's a mask.

1562
02:18:04,316 --> 02:18:08,460
LAURA: Maybe it's an illusion.

1563
02:18:08,460 --> 02:18:10,214
TALIESIN: Fire a grit.

1564
02:18:10,214 --> 02:18:16,560
MARISHA: Did you custom mess with this figure? You
did, didn't you?

1565
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:18,038
MATT: Just to cover the face.

1566
02:18:18,038 --> 02:18:22,562
TALIESIN: To hide his shame. Do I add the d4 to
this, if I so am inclined?

1567
02:18:22,562 --> 02:18:24,380
MATT: Yes.

1568
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:25,812
TALIESIN: And I can do it every time?

1569
02:18:25,812 --> 02:18:26,933
MATT: Every attack, yeah.

1570
02:18:26,933 --> 02:18:35,486
TALIESIN: Oh wow, this is so nuts. So first
attack. Out of curiosity, does it keep my misfire?

1571
02:18:35,486 --> 02:18:37,527
Does it knock me out of misfire, technically?

1572
02:18:37,527 --> 02:18:39,139
MATT: It's still rolling on the d20.

1573
02:18:39,139 --> 02:18:47,860
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Okay. Let's put that away,
then, and let's take some psychic damage, because

1574
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:50,293
that's funny. Oh, that's great. Okay.

1575
02:18:50,293 --> 02:18:51,959
MATT: Nine points of psychic damage.

1576
02:18:51,959 --> 02:19:01,571
TALIESIN: Yeah, so 142, that's cool. Ow. I'm going
to put that down and get a bigger gun and try that

1577
02:19:01,571 --> 02:19:13,718
again. And that blows that grit, as well. Much
better! No, it's not. Oh my god. Oh my fucking

1578
02:19:13,718 --> 02:19:24,366
god. It's just doing it. Never mind. I'm going to
blow the rest of it and spend the end of my turn

1579
02:19:24,366 --> 02:19:29,081
trying to fix one of my guns really quickly, and
do a quick clear-out. Which is 12 versus misfire

1580
02:19:29,081 --> 02:19:35,898
on the psychic. And I do!

1581
02:19:35,898 --> 02:19:37,662
MATT: You manage to clear the weapon.

1582
02:19:37,662 --> 02:19:45,010
TALIESIN: I cleared Animus. Bad News is still out
of commission. And that's my turn. Never mind.

1583
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:51,016
MATT: So as the blade storm, it does a large sweep
all the way around it with the blade, hitting

1584
02:19:51,016 --> 02:19:52,955
everything within 15 feet of it.

1585
02:19:52,955 --> 02:19:56,135
SAM: Is it an automatic hit, or is it something I
can do Cutting Words on?

1586
02:19:56,135 --> 02:20:03,832
MATT: It's a roll to hit, but Cutting Words would
affect a single attack against an individual.

1587
02:20:03,832 --> 02:20:15,182
Yeah, because each attack roll is separate, so it
would affect one of the attack rolls.

1588
02:20:15,182 --> 02:20:22,023
SAM: Well, I will Cutting Words it for my attack.
No, he's going to hit me no matter what. Who's in

1589
02:20:22,023 --> 02:20:23,871
the path?

1590
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:32,337
MATT: Well, let's find out first. So it's going to
be Vex, Vax, Scanlan, and Grog. And then Keyleth

1591
02:20:32,337 --> 02:20:41,051
and Percy are out of range, as well as the
elemental. So against Vex that is a 17.

1592
02:20:41,051 --> 02:20:42,129
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

1593
02:20:42,129 --> 02:20:47,966
MATT: Doesn't it, and you dodge out of the way.
For Vax, 17.

1594
02:20:47,966 --> 02:20:48,942
LIAM: Nope.

1595
02:20:48,942 --> 02:20:57,544
MATT: Rolled two threes in a row. Striking around
to Grog, that is a 24.

1596
02:20:57,544 --> 02:21:02,291
TRAVIS: That'll hit. Can I try my parry maneuver?

1597
02:21:02,291 --> 02:21:05,056
MATT: What does the parry do?

1598
02:21:05,056 --> 02:21:11,759
TRAVIS: It uses your dex modifier plus the--

1599
02:21:11,759 --> 02:21:16,253
LAURA: Sup dice? He really wrote sup dice.

1600
02:21:16,253 --> 02:21:20,642
MATT: Yes, you can, to reduce the attack by your
superiority dice plus your dexterity modifier. Yep.

1601
02:21:20,642 --> 02:21:26,725
TRAVIS: I'm going to try. Seven plus two. Nine?

1602
02:21:26,725 --> 02:21:33,432
MATT: So you would take 37 points of slashing
damage, but instead you take nine away. That would

1603
02:21:33,432 --> 02:21:35,691
be 28. So you get 28 points of slashing damage.

1604
02:21:35,691 --> 02:21:38,048
TRAVIS: I'm not raging.

1605
02:21:38,048 --> 02:21:41,349
TALIESIN: And you took 28 points.

1606
02:21:41,349 --> 02:21:50,931
MATT: And you are pushed 15 feet away. You are now
right off, you get knocked over the side. You get

1607
02:21:50,931 --> 02:21:55,170
knocked prone off onto the edge of the platform
there, almost catching yourself before rolling off

1608
02:21:55,170 --> 02:21:56,702
the side of the platform.

1609
02:21:56,702 --> 02:21:58,276
LIAM: It's so exciting!

1610
02:21:58,276 --> 02:22:05,101
MATT: Scanlan, that is a natural two. That's a 16
to hit.

1611
02:22:05,101 --> 02:22:10,314
SAM: It will hit, but I will do my Cutting Words.

1612
02:22:10,314 --> 02:22:11,926
MATT: Okay, so roll a d12.

1613
02:22:11,926 --> 02:22:17,228
SAM: Okay, a d12. I rolled a nine.

1614
02:22:17,228 --> 02:22:21,351
MATT: Okay, so that will miss you. As it swings
towards you, what do you do?

1615
02:22:21,351 --> 02:22:29,074
SAM: I will quote Dr. Smith again and I will yell
at him: you are a tiresome, tin-plated,

1616
02:22:29,074 --> 02:22:30,981
tintinnabulation.

1617
02:22:30,981 --> 02:22:39,078
MATT: The second construct you've bruised the ego
of today. I need you to make a constitution saving

1618
02:22:39,078 --> 02:22:40,220
throw, Grog.

1619
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:45,585
TRAVIS: Okay. 18, with a minus two.

1620
02:22:45,585 --> 02:22:52,636
MATT: 18? No. Your vision fades as the curse takes
hold. You are considered blinded at the moment.

1621
02:22:52,636 --> 02:22:57,875
TRAVIS: Okay. Anybody else? Lights out for anyone
else?

1622
02:22:57,875 --> 02:23:01,471
MATT: And that's its turn. Vex, you're up.

1623
02:23:01,471 --> 02:23:02,939
TRAVIS: No big deal.

1624
02:23:02,939 --> 02:23:11,787
LAURA: Oh jeebies. Oh! I can use disengage! So he
doesn't hit me! I'm going to move away from him.

1625
02:23:11,787 --> 02:23:13,447
MATT: Okay, where do you move?

1626
02:23:13,447 --> 02:23:15,238
LAURA: All the way across, over here.

1627
02:23:15,238 --> 02:23:19,801
MATT: Well, your movement with your broom is? How
fast is your broom?

1628
02:23:19,801 --> 02:23:24,441
LAURA: I don't remember because I don't have the
thing anymore.

1629
02:23:24,441 --> 02:23:27,326
MATT: (heavy sigh)

1630
02:23:27,326 --> 02:23:38,323
LAURA: I know, Matthew! I think it's 40.
Probably.

1631
02:23:38,323 --> 02:23:40,740
MATT: Broom of Flying: 50 feet.

1632
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:42,309
LIAM: Wow, that was fast!

1633
02:23:42,309 --> 02:23:45,819
MATT: Look at that. Analog!

1634
02:23:45,819 --> 02:23:49,753
LAURA: 50 feet. I'm writing it down right now,
okay?

1635
02:23:49,753 --> 02:23:56,579
MATT: You can get right over right above where
Percival is. So that's your bonus action to

1636
02:23:56,579 --> 02:24:01,462
disengage, your movement to get there. What are
you doing now?

1637
02:24:01,462 --> 02:24:02,895
LAURA: I'm going to attack him.

1638
02:24:02,895 --> 02:24:04,489
MATT: Go for it.

1639
02:24:04,489 --> 02:24:12,482
LAURA: That dice attacked me while I rolled it. A
23.

1640
02:24:12,482 --> 02:24:13,791
MATT: 23 misses.

1641
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:14,942
TALIESIN: What?!

1642
02:24:14,942 --> 02:24:17,086
TRAVIS: 23 misses?

1643
02:24:17,086 --> 02:24:21,886
MATT: Yeah. You strike the armor on the side of
its body, and the arrow disintegrates on impact.

1644
02:24:21,886 --> 02:24:24,925
You see bits of it catch flame from the nearby
heat.

1645
02:24:24,925 --> 02:24:33,657
LAURA: Oh lord. Okay. I thought because he was
big, maybe. Is he covered head to toe in armor?

1646
02:24:33,657 --> 02:24:38,101
MATT: It's made of solid stone with pieces of
metal armor around the body.

1647
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:46,839
LAURA: Great. Okay, so I'm going to attack him
again but in his neck. Oh, that's good. That

1648
02:24:46,839 --> 02:24:49,297
probably hits. 18 plus 14.

1649
02:24:49,297 --> 02:24:50,454
MATT: That'll hit, yeah.

1650
02:24:50,454 --> 02:25:00,635
LAURA: Okay, I didn't want to do the math.
(counting) Do I get sneak attack?

1651
02:25:00,635 --> 02:25:03,224
MATT: He is in base to base with your brother, so
yes.

1652
02:25:03,224 --> 02:25:12,721
LAURA: Wait, that's lightning. One extra lightning
damage and then nine sneak attack.

1653
02:25:12,721 --> 02:25:14,398
MATT: Okay, so the total on that is?

1654
02:25:14,398 --> 02:25:17,950
LAURA: 17 plus nine is 27.

1655
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:21,111
MATT: 26, yeah.

1656
02:25:21,111 --> 02:25:23,541
LAURA: Plus one lightning damage, so it's 27.

1657
02:25:23,541 --> 02:25:28,169
MATT: Right, there you go. All right, cool. The
first arrow shatters, the second one you manage to

1658
02:25:28,169 --> 02:25:32,506
strike and it embeds itself in the stone, and
sticking out. It's hard to see if it had made much

1659
02:25:32,506 --> 02:25:36,904
of an impact. That ends your turn, and that brings
us to Scanlan.

1660
02:25:36,904 --> 02:25:40,766
SAM: Me? Oh Jesus. This thing's big and scary.

1661
02:25:40,766 --> 02:25:44,963
MATT: You're on the top of the staircase next to
the water elemental and Grog, who's currently on

1662
02:25:44,963 --> 02:25:48,851
the ground screaming that he's blind. The entity
is about 15 feet away from you. You're just out of

1663
02:25:48,851 --> 02:25:54,378
range of its blade, and it's an intimidating thing
to have that close to you.

1664
02:25:54,378 --> 02:26:04,092
SAM: Yeah! Of course it is! I'm not dumb. Super
intimidating! So how far is he from me?

1665
02:26:04,092 --> 02:26:13,141
MATT: He's about 16 feet from you. You're just out
of range of the blade. Well, no. Actually, because

1666
02:26:13,141 --> 02:26:17,157
it did hit you, so on the edge of there, you are
within 15 feet of him, yeah.

1667
02:26:17,157 --> 02:26:26,413
SAM: Okay, not knowing what to do, I will
(raspberry). I'm looking at my spells; I've got

1668
02:26:26,413 --> 02:26:32,102
nothing. I will blast him with a Lightning Bolt, a
level three Lightning Bolt.

1669
02:26:32,102 --> 02:26:35,614
MATT: Level three Lightning Bolt. Okay, so roll 8d6
points of damage.

1670
02:26:35,614 --> 02:26:39,775
SAM: You know what, I'll do level four, so 9d6, I
suppose.

1671
02:26:39,775 --> 02:26:49,993
MATT: All righty, so that is a natural 20. So
that's advantage on the saving throw. However, its

1672
02:26:49,993 --> 02:26:53,986
dexterity bonus is nothing. It's a straight 20.
Your spell DC?

1673
02:26:53,986 --> 02:26:55,289
SAM: 22.

1674
02:26:55,289 --> 02:26:56,957
MATT: 22, so it does not make the save.

1675
02:26:56,957 --> 02:26:59,776
SAM: So it's 34 points of damage.

1676
02:26:59,776 --> 02:27:07,810
MATT: 34 points of lightning damage to it. The
bolt hits it and seems to arc through, and its

1677
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:11,713
faceless head slowly shifts to face you.

1678
02:27:11,713 --> 02:27:19,778
SAM: Jesus. I'm within melee range of him, so if I
move I will get hit, yes?

1679
02:27:19,778 --> 02:27:21,688
MATT: If you move out of his melee range, you
will, yes.

1680
02:27:21,688 --> 02:27:22,714
SAM: Okay.

1681
02:27:22,714 --> 02:27:25,448
MATT: You'll get attacked. Doesn't mean you'll get
hit.

1682
02:27:25,448 --> 02:27:29,124
SAM: Grog, you're okay, right?

1683
02:27:29,124 --> 02:27:37,128
TRAVIS: I'm blind! It's very hot!

1684
02:27:37,128 --> 02:27:38,174
SAM: What?

1685
02:27:38,174 --> 02:27:40,947
TRAVIS: It's very hot! On the ground, and I'm
blind!

1686
02:27:40,947 --> 02:27:48,204
SAM: I don't know what to do about you, I'm sorry!
I'll inspire you, I guess, right? Because you

1687
02:27:48,204 --> 02:27:49,262
don't need health?

1688
02:27:49,262 --> 02:27:50,818
TRAVIS: Yeah, great, thanks!

1689
02:27:50,818 --> 02:27:57,720
SAM: (laughs) Sorry! All right, I'll inspire him,
I suppose.

1690
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:58,868
MATT: Okay.

1691
02:27:58,868 --> 02:28:01,776
SAM: Sorry, Grog.

1692
02:28:01,776 --> 02:28:03,686
TRAVIS: What do you sing?

1693
02:28:03,686 --> 02:28:10,244
SAM: Oh, sorry. I will pick up my flute and I will
sing: (singing) You like it when my flute goes,

1694
02:28:10,244 --> 02:28:18,156
baby make your booty glow, Scanlan know you want
to show my song, song, song, song, song.

1695
02:28:18,156 --> 02:28:20,028
TRAVIS: Is that Sisqó?!

1696
02:28:20,028 --> 02:28:27,433
MATT: Take your d12. All righty. That's your
bonus, your action, and are you going to stay

1697
02:28:27,433 --> 02:28:28,941
where you are or are you going to move?

1698
02:28:28,941 --> 02:28:30,381
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to stay where I am.

1699
02:28:30,381 --> 02:28:34,794
MATT: Okay. Ending that turn, it comes to the
elemental. Actually, no. At the end of Scanlan's

1700
02:28:34,794 --> 02:28:39,856
turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary
action to make a rune blade strike against Vax,

1701
02:28:39,856 --> 02:28:45,284
who's right in front of him. That is a 22 to hit.

1702
02:28:45,284 --> 02:28:49,049
LIAM: And this is a straight-up attack. Yeah, I
believe that hits. Yes, it does.

1703
02:28:49,049 --> 02:28:50,142
MATT: Okay.

1704
02:28:50,142 --> 02:28:55,979
LIAM: Wait. I'll use my last Luck of the day on
him, and he has to reroll.

1705
02:28:55,979 --> 02:28:56,935
MATT: Okay.

1706
02:28:56,935 --> 02:28:57,820
MARISHA: Wait.

1707
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,836
LIAM: Wait.

1708
02:28:58,836 --> 02:29:01,674
MATT: That is a 19.

1709
02:29:01,674 --> 02:29:02,848
LIAM and MATT: No.

1710
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:04,781
(cheering)

1711
02:29:04,781 --> 02:29:06,298
TRAVIS: Well done!

1712
02:29:06,298 --> 02:29:12,186
MATT: So as the blade arcs overhead towards you,
you barely duck out of the way. It slams on the

1713
02:29:12,186 --> 02:29:15,870
ground, sending shards of stone and metal up in
the air around you. You feel it rain over your

1714
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:23,731
shoulder and the back of your head as you slowly
pull away from it. All righty, now it is the

1715
02:29:23,731 --> 02:29:24,680
elemental's turn.

1716
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:39,100
MARISHA: Okay, it's going to move over to him. And
he's bigger than large, so he's going to do a

1717
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:47,919
multiattack. He's going to do two slam attacks.
Plus seven to hit. (groans) One's a natural one;

1718
02:29:47,919 --> 02:29:54,059
the other's a natural 18. So one hits. 2d8 plus
four bludgeoning damage.

1719
02:29:54,059 --> 02:29:55,894
MATT: What's the attack? 18 plus?

1720
02:29:55,894 --> 02:29:58,159
MARISHA: 18 plus seven.

1721
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:04,411
MATT: Okay, so it would be 25? That hits. Are the
creature's attacks considered magical?

1722
02:30:04,411 --> 02:30:08,675
MARISHA: They're two bludgeoning attacks.

1723
02:30:08,675 --> 02:30:12,270
MATT: Nowhere on there does it say it does magical
damage?

1724
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:16,227
MARISHA: It just says bludgeoning damage.

1725
02:30:16,227 --> 02:30:23,669
MATT: Okay. So as the elemental swings out both
fists against it, no effect. None of its attacks

1726
02:30:23,669 --> 02:30:29,283
seem to have any effect or impact on the creature.
It's like bludgeoning the side of a mountain.

1727
02:30:29,283 --> 02:30:31,688
TALIESIN: Okay. Good to know.

1728
02:30:31,688 --> 02:30:35,077
MARISHA: And he doesn't seem to be distracted or
give two shits about him.

1729
02:30:35,077 --> 02:30:36,255
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

1730
02:30:36,255 --> 02:30:40,354
MARISHA: Okay. Cool.

1731
02:30:40,354 --> 02:30:42,047
TALIESIN: There's a lot of fires to put out, I
guess.

1732
02:30:42,047 --> 02:30:45,497
MARISHA: Yeah. You know, I'll keep him on standby
in case people catch on fire.

1733
02:30:45,497 --> 02:30:51,715
MATT: (laughs) Okay. That ends the elemental's
turn, then? Grog and Keyleth, you're up.

1734
02:30:51,715 --> 02:30:55,532
MARISHA: What did you find out?

1735
02:30:55,532 --> 02:30:57,671
TRAVIS: How about you go first?

1736
02:30:57,671 --> 02:31:07,143
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do 9th-level
Shapechange and take a cue from Scanlan and turn

1737
02:31:07,143 --> 02:31:08,421
into a planetar.

1738
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:12,102
LIAM: Ooh! Do you have a big dick, too?

1739
02:31:12,102 --> 02:31:13,486
SAM: You can do that?

1740
02:31:13,486 --> 02:31:20,472
MARISHA: Yes I can. With Shapechange. Right? It is
a challenge rating that I can do, right?

1741
02:31:20,472 --> 02:31:21,851
Planetars?

1742
02:31:21,851 --> 02:31:23,651
MATT: Yeah, you can.

1743
02:31:23,651 --> 02:31:24,699
MARISHA: Okay.

1744
02:31:24,699 --> 02:31:26,285
MATT: You lose concentration on the elemental.

1745
02:31:26,285 --> 02:31:27,166
MARISHA: That's fine.

1746
02:31:27,166 --> 02:31:28,751
TALIESIN: Not like he was really--

1747
02:31:28,751 --> 02:31:29,952
MARISHA: Doing much.

1748
02:31:29,952 --> 02:31:31,881
MATT: But the elemental stays and is now hostile
to you.

1749
02:31:31,881 --> 02:31:37,881
MARISHA: Right. Can't dissipate him or anything?

1750
02:31:37,881 --> 02:31:42,242
MATT: I forgot your figure again! I'm the worst!

1751
02:31:42,242 --> 02:31:50,596
TALIESIN: I was going to say, can you dissipate
it?

1752
02:31:50,596 --> 02:31:51,832
MARISHA: Not really.

1753
02:31:51,832 --> 02:31:52,852
TALIESIN: Oh. That's okay.

1754
02:31:52,852 --> 02:31:57,360
MATT: So the planetar size is large. We'll say for
the purposes once again of this week, we'll use

1755
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:02,743
Doty as the planetar, so there you are.

1756
02:32:02,743 --> 02:32:04,924
LAURA: But he says it in Swedish.

1757
02:32:04,924 --> 02:32:08,836
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Dooty.

1758
02:32:08,836 --> 02:32:11,922
MATT: Your wings extend. You are now in the
planetar form.

1759
02:32:11,922 --> 02:32:18,254
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go up to Grog and do
Healing--

1760
02:32:18,254 --> 02:32:22,073
MATT: Well, your action is to cast the spell.

1761
02:32:22,073 --> 02:32:25,752
MARISHA: (groans) So I can't do anything else?

1762
02:32:25,752 --> 02:32:30,329
MATT: No, Shapechange takes an action to make the
transformation. Next turn you can take your

1763
02:32:30,329 --> 02:32:31,301
action.

1764
02:32:31,301 --> 02:32:36,320
LAURA: It's okay. That's great. Grog definitely
won't fall in the lava on his turn.

1765
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:41,707
MARISHA: I was going to say, can I at least go up
to him and grab onto Grog's loincloth to make sure

1766
02:32:41,707 --> 02:32:43,806
his ass doesn't tumble into the lava?

1767
02:32:43,806 --> 02:32:45,208
MATT: You could certainly try.

1768
02:32:45,208 --> 02:32:47,744
TALIESIN: You could kind of do that.

1769
02:32:47,744 --> 02:32:49,105
SAM: Loin-grab.

1770
02:32:49,105 --> 02:32:56,061
MATT: So we'll say for the purposes of this, you
glide over, and you're now flying up next to Grog

1771
02:32:56,061 --> 02:32:59,437
on the edge of the platform. There you go.

1772
02:32:59,437 --> 02:33:03,796
LAURA: To keep him from wandering off.

1773
02:33:03,796 --> 02:33:04,814
MARISHA: Yeah.

1774
02:33:04,814 --> 02:33:07,438
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog?

1775
02:33:07,438 --> 02:33:16,280
TRAVIS: Cool. Can I use my action to get up from
being prone? Half my movement, sorry. Onto one

1776
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:25,063
knee. In my mind, because I can't see! And can I
hold my action until I can see again or until it's

1777
02:33:25,063 --> 02:33:26,147
my turn?

1778
02:33:26,147 --> 02:33:27,421
MATT: It's your turn.

1779
02:33:27,421 --> 02:33:29,449
TRAVIS: Until I can see again.

1780
02:33:29,449 --> 02:33:34,001
TALIESIN: You don't get to save against this, does
he?

1781
02:33:34,001 --> 02:33:38,241
MATT: No. Nope. All right. So that ends Grog's
turn, holding his action.

1782
02:33:38,241 --> 02:33:41,167
TRAVIS: Crouched, so both hands are on the
ground.

1783
02:33:41,167 --> 02:33:45,267
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, it's going to
use another legendary action to take another swing

1784
02:33:45,267 --> 02:33:56,946
at the slippery little rogue paladin on the ground
that it can't seem to hit. Natural one. Jesus

1785
02:33:56,946 --> 02:34:00,075
Christ. Okay. That'll be the end of that luck.

1786
02:34:00,075 --> 02:34:02,905
LIAM: That demigod does not exist in this
universe.

1787
02:34:02,905 --> 02:34:04,395
MATT: Percival, your turn.

1788
02:34:04,395 --> 02:34:10,759
TALIESIN: So first thing I'm going to do is get a
quick little heal bonus going, because why not.

1789
02:34:10,759 --> 02:34:27,698
Let's do a heal. So that's 14 points up, so I'm
156. A little bit better, and that's my heal. I'm

1790
02:34:27,698 --> 02:34:35,713
noticing that this thing's only taking magic
damage. The hammer it dropped is underneath the

1791
02:34:35,713 --> 02:34:37,156
planetar right now, right?

1792
02:34:37,156 --> 02:34:43,384
MATT: It is currently dangling off the side, along
with other series of tools: tongs and other

1793
02:34:43,384 --> 02:34:45,658
smaller blacksmithing accoutrements.

1794
02:34:45,658 --> 02:34:48,445
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in that direction.

1795
02:34:48,445 --> 02:34:58,253
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20. Another step, and
you're starting to hit the molten metal and rock.

1796
02:34:58,253 --> 02:35:01,441
TALIESIN: Molten metal and rock? I can't jump
that, can I?

1797
02:35:01,441 --> 02:35:03,340
MATT: You can try, yeah. Make an athletics check.

1798
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:08,703
TALIESIN: Not an acrobatics check, I take it?

1799
02:35:08,703 --> 02:35:09,937
MATT: Not for the leap.

1800
02:35:09,937 --> 02:35:14,660
TALIESIN: But there are chains that I can reach
there?

1801
02:35:14,660 --> 02:35:20,223
MATT: If you're leaping towards the chains, you can
attempt to grab it, yeah.

1802
02:35:20,223 --> 02:35:25,341
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to attempt to grab
the hammer.

1803
02:35:25,341 --> 02:35:28,533
MATT: Okay. Are you using it to swing, or are you just
trying to grab and hold on?

1804
02:35:28,533 --> 02:35:31,084
TALIESIN: If it's available for a swing, I'll try
for a swing.

1805
02:35:31,084 --> 02:35:34,436
MATT: Okay, I'll give you advantage if you're
going for the chain, then, as you're swinging

1806
02:35:34,436 --> 02:35:36,020
across it. Go for it.

1807
02:35:36,020 --> 02:35:39,109
TALIESIN: Roll with advantage? Athletics?

1808
02:35:39,109 --> 02:35:40,121
MATT: Athletics.

1809
02:35:40,121 --> 02:35:42,302
MARISHA: Please don't fucking fall in lava.

1810
02:35:42,302 --> 02:35:43,587
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1811
02:35:43,587 --> 02:35:46,031
(cheering)

1812
02:35:46,031 --> 02:35:49,112
MATT: Percival runs, swings across, and I'll move
this a bit.

1813
02:35:49,112 --> 02:35:51,181
LIAM: Oh, the golem is dead.

1814
02:35:51,181 --> 02:35:59,223
MATT: Percival barely makes it across. (grunts) If
you let go of the chain, you'll land. If you hold

1815
02:35:59,223 --> 02:36:02,597
onto it you'll dangle and swing in the center.

1816
02:36:02,597 --> 02:36:03,912
TALIESIN: This is the hammer chain?

1817
02:36:03,912 --> 02:36:04,882
MATT: Yeah.

1818
02:36:04,882 --> 02:36:08,832
TALIESIN: So am I touching the hammer right now?
But it's not a magic hammer, it's just a really

1819
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,827
nice hammer.

1820
02:36:09,827 --> 02:36:12,668
MATT: You just grabbed it. You can take a moment to look
at it next round, if you want to.

1821
02:36:12,668 --> 02:36:15,499
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to take a moment to look
at it. I've got an action, still.

1822
02:36:15,499 --> 02:36:17,137
MATT: Do you want to do that, then?

1823
02:36:17,137 --> 02:36:21,035
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll use my action to admire the
hammer.

1824
02:36:21,035 --> 02:36:26,179
MATT: Okay. Make a arcana check. As you're
clutching the hammer now, it's dangling down, and

1825
02:36:26,179 --> 02:36:30,281
you're holding onto it. And the heat is burning
from underneath you, and you can see the

1826
02:36:30,281 --> 02:36:32,016
(bubbling noises).

1827
02:36:32,016 --> 02:36:34,236
TALIESIN: No. I have an arcana of seven.

1828
02:36:34,236 --> 02:36:39,000
MATT: Seven. You're distracted by everything going
on around you and the heat in your face. You can

1829
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:45,585
see it above you, the black and gold scrolling on
it. It looks beautiful, but you can't make out any

1830
02:36:45,585 --> 02:36:47,212
more details than that, unfortunately.

1831
02:36:47,212 --> 02:36:50,004
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. Okay, I'm hopping
off, then.

1832
02:36:50,004 --> 02:36:55,559
MATT: You swing back, you swing, and then you
land. We'll say because you rolled a natural 20,

1833
02:36:55,559 --> 02:36:56,663
I'll let you do that.

1834
02:36:56,663 --> 02:36:59,109
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right. I'm over there, hiding.
Fuck.

1835
02:36:59,109 --> 02:37:03,132
MATT: Okay, that ends Percy's turn. At the end of
Percy's turn, it's going to use its third and

1836
02:37:03,132 --> 02:37:04,033
final--

1837
02:37:04,033 --> 02:37:07,732
LIAM: Damn it. What? Where did the big guy go?
There he is!

1838
02:37:07,732 --> 02:37:09,341
SAM: He's trying to kill the cricket.

1839
02:37:09,341 --> 02:37:10,581
MATT: You did it? Good job.

1840
02:37:10,581 --> 02:37:12,053
LAURA: It shut him up for a little bit.

1841
02:37:12,053 --> 02:37:14,364
LIAM: Can't get the golem, but you can get the
cricket.

1842
02:37:14,364 --> 02:37:19,960
MATT: (laughs) Well done. All right, at the end of
Percival's turn, it's going to use its third and

1843
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:24,791
final legendary action to to try and get that hit
on you. Natural 20.

1844
02:37:24,791 --> 02:37:26,565
(groaning)

1845
02:37:26,565 --> 02:37:28,194
TRAVIS: Oh my god, really?

1846
02:37:28,194 --> 02:37:30,360
LIAM: Making up for the last time. Fine, give it
to me.

1847
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:32,185
LAURA: No, can you uncanny dodge?

1848
02:37:32,185 --> 02:37:35,007
LIAM: I can uncanny dodge, yes.

1849
02:37:35,007 --> 02:37:36,669
LAURA: Don't you have another thing?

1850
02:37:36,669 --> 02:37:45,866
LIAM: Just uncanny dodge, so maybe I can cancel
out his doubling. Yeah. Uncanny dodge halves the

1851
02:37:45,866 --> 02:37:47,970
attack, so it'll be right where it's supposed to
be.

1852
02:37:47,970 --> 02:37:53,513
TALIESIN: Technically, it'll lower slightly lower
than where it's supposed to be, because it doesn't

1853
02:37:53,513 --> 02:37:55,543
just halve the doubling of the dice.

1854
02:37:55,543 --> 02:37:57,701
MATT: 57 points of slashing damage.

1855
02:37:57,701 --> 02:37:58,750
LIAM: Uncanny dodge.

1856
02:37:58,750 --> 02:38:10,612
MATT: All right, reduce that to 28 points of damage
and your vision goes dark.

1857
02:38:10,612 --> 02:38:13,279
LAURA: Oh no. Wait, don't you have to roll the
constitution?

1858
02:38:13,279 --> 02:38:16,640
MATT: That's true. Roll constitution save.

1859
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:20,888
LIAM: Not good. 14.

1860
02:38:20,888 --> 02:38:26,043
MATT: Your vision goes dark. It hits you, and you
hit the ground, and the sheer-- the searing pain

1861
02:38:26,043 --> 02:38:30,571
hits your body, and as you get up, it feels like
all the smoke fills your vision. All you see are

1862
02:38:30,571 --> 02:38:37,065
occasional flashes of red, almost like you're
surrounded by a miniaturized electrical storm, and

1863
02:38:37,065 --> 02:38:38,937
you have no idea what's around you.

1864
02:38:38,937 --> 02:38:40,131
MARISHA: So he's blind?

1865
02:38:40,131 --> 02:38:43,450
MATT: You're considered blind for the moment, yes.
It's your turn.

1866
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:50,063
LIAM: Okay, I would like to cast Vow of Enmity on
this dick, which will put me at regular, because I

1867
02:38:50,063 --> 02:38:54,752
would get advantage versus the disadvantage of
blindness, so now I'm at regular.

1868
02:38:54,752 --> 02:38:56,436
LAURA: Is it a visual spell?

1869
02:38:56,436 --> 02:38:58,480
MATT: That's what I'm checking right now.

1870
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:00,600
LIAM: Oh, wow. I've got it here.

1871
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:03,110
MARISHA: Yeah, spellcasting's a bitch.

1872
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:11,484
MATT: Vow of Enmity. Creature you can see within
ten feet of you. You cannot currently see it.

1873
02:39:11,484 --> 02:39:15,990
TRAVIS: Shit, y'all. Fuck.

1874
02:39:15,990 --> 02:39:21,347
LIAM: Okay. Instead, I'll use my bonus action to
cast Hunter's Mark.

1875
02:39:21,347 --> 02:39:23,421
MATT: You need--

1876
02:39:23,421 --> 02:39:38,254
LIAM: Visual on that as well? Okay, got it, never
mind. It's not his turn yet, wow. Okay, I'm going

1877
02:39:38,254 --> 02:39:54,365
to use my bonus action to disengage. I can move
five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. And I'm going to get

1878
02:39:54,365 --> 02:40:00,918
the fuck out of here. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30,
there. And that's it, I'm fucking blind and I ran

1879
02:40:00,918 --> 02:40:03,412
because I can't see shit. Done.

1880
02:40:03,412 --> 02:40:07,532
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. It's now its
turn. It gets its legendary actions back.

1881
02:40:07,532 --> 02:40:15,452
LAURA: Guys, this is bad. We haven't actually done
anything to him, have we? No, I got an arrow on him.

1882
02:40:15,452 --> 02:40:18,618
TALIESIN: You got an arrow, which didn't probably
do any physical--

1883
02:40:18,618 --> 02:40:21,490
LAURA: It was a magical arrow.

1884
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:24,030
MATT: See if it gets its blade storm back. Nope.

1885
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:26,264
TRAVIS: Probably should have cast the mansion door
before we started.

1886
02:40:26,264 --> 02:40:28,909
TALIESIN: We can still do that.

1887
02:40:28,909 --> 02:40:30,721
TRAVIS: It takes a minute to cast.

1888
02:40:30,721 --> 02:40:31,788
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

1889
02:40:31,788 --> 02:40:33,094
MARISHA: We can make this work.

1890
02:40:33,094 --> 02:40:34,298
LAURA: We can't even run away.

1891
02:40:34,298 --> 02:40:37,147
LIAM: He's coming to finish me off. Look at this
motherfucker!

1892
02:40:37,147 --> 02:40:48,746
LAURA: He's going to kill all of us, dude. He can
get all of us in a circle. Everybody.

1893
02:40:48,746 --> 02:40:51,139
MARISHA: I lost control of my elemental.

1894
02:40:51,139 --> 02:40:57,519
MATT: Here's what it's going to do. Because you
ran off. It hit you; it's not even focused on you.

1895
02:40:57,519 --> 02:41:02,951
The head turns and looks towards you, Vex'ahlia.
It's going to make a rune blade attack against

1896
02:41:02,951 --> 02:41:06,647
you. Oh jeez. That is a 17.

1897
02:41:06,647 --> 02:41:07,998
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

1898
02:41:07,998 --> 02:41:13,064
MATT: Jesus Christ, it has rolled so many twos and
threes, then 20. It swings and you dodge out of

1899
02:41:13,064 --> 02:41:17,490
the way. However, hearing the skittering of a gnome
behind him, without even looking, it back-kicks

1900
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:18,983
behind it with its foot.

1901
02:41:18,983 --> 02:41:21,043
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

1902
02:41:21,043 --> 02:41:25,351
MATT: That is going to be a 21, Scanlan.

1903
02:41:25,351 --> 02:41:27,162
SAM: Oh, yeah, of course.

1904
02:41:27,162 --> 02:41:35,042
MATT: All right, so you take 23 points of
bludgeoning damage and you are pushed 15 feet away

1905
02:41:35,042 --> 02:41:36,702
from it and knocked prone.

1906
02:41:36,702 --> 02:41:40,914
LAURA and MARISHA: No!

1907
02:41:40,914 --> 02:41:43,415
MATT: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
Scanlan.

1908
02:41:43,415 --> 02:41:46,532
LIAM: Hey, you're blessed, so add 1d4.

1909
02:41:46,532 --> 02:41:50,422
SAM: Oh yeah, that's right. Okay, that's
terrible.

1910
02:41:50,422 --> 02:41:52,965
LIAM: Plus 1d4.

1911
02:41:52,965 --> 02:42:06,878
SAM: So I've already rolled a 13, plus a d4. This
is not going to go well, is it? d4 is another one.

1912
02:42:06,878 --> 02:42:08,194
That's 14.

1913
02:42:08,194 --> 02:42:10,539
LAURA: Can you inspire yourself?

1914
02:42:10,539 --> 02:42:13,721
SAM: What?

1915
02:42:13,721 --> 02:42:15,433
LIAM and LAURA: Inspire yourself.

1916
02:42:15,433 --> 02:42:18,506
SAM: This is not a check; this is a save.

1917
02:42:18,506 --> 02:42:23,827
MATT: Well, let me double check on that for your
bardic ability. And how many more bardic

1918
02:42:23,827 --> 02:42:25,940
inspirations do you have at this point, by the
way?

1919
02:42:25,940 --> 02:42:28,158
SAM: I've only used two.

1920
02:42:28,158 --> 02:42:32,905
MATT: You used Cutting Words, you've inspired
Keyleth, and you've inspired Grog.

1921
02:42:32,905 --> 02:42:40,301
SAM: Oh, Cutting Words counts? Then I've used four
so far, and I have two more to go.

1922
02:42:40,301 --> 02:42:48,809
MATT: Two more to go. And as far as your peerless
skill, you can add it to any ability check, yeah,

1923
02:42:48,873 --> 02:42:51,250
so not a save, unfortunately.

1924
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:53,647
SAM: All right, bye guys.

1925
02:42:53,647 --> 02:42:55,698
MATT: What was the total?

1926
02:42:55,698 --> 02:42:56,984
SAM: 14.

1927
02:42:56,984 --> 02:43:00,632
TALIESIN: Is that including your dex save?

1928
02:43:00,632 --> 02:43:02,238
SAM: Yeah.

1929
02:43:02,238 --> 02:43:03,255
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

1930
02:43:03,255 --> 02:43:11,433
MATT: Scanlan gets pushed off the edge and falls
prone (sizzling) into the molten metal below.

1931
02:43:11,433 --> 02:43:14,527
TALIESIN: Oh man. This is so bad.

1932
02:43:14,527 --> 02:43:17,666
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice he's picking up.

1933
02:43:17,666 --> 02:43:19,170
MATT: You're on fire.

1934
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:20,506
SAM: Sure, sure.

1935
02:43:20,506 --> 02:43:31,544
TRAVIS: I feel like you're filling a playground with
gravel right now. I feel like he's playing putt

1936
02:43:31,544 --> 02:43:32,933
putt golf with us.

1937
02:43:32,933 --> 02:43:38,529
LIAM: Well, he's strung us along on several
battles to get all of our juice out.

1938
02:43:38,529 --> 02:43:42,935
MARISHA: Yeah, he really has. We need to rest.

1939
02:43:42,935 --> 02:43:49,631
MATT: You take 53 points of fire damage, Scanlan,
as you are currently now partially submerged in

1940
02:43:49,631 --> 02:43:52,031
molten metal and screaming in horrible pain.

1941
02:43:52,031 --> 02:43:54,686
LIAM: Man. Boy, it sucks, doesn't it, buddy?

1942
02:43:54,686 --> 02:43:58,250
SAM: But with vibrato.

1943
02:43:58,250 --> 02:44:01,854
MATT: That's going to end its turn. Vex, you're
up.

1944
02:44:01,854 --> 02:44:04,608
LAURA: Great. I'm going to disengage.

1945
02:44:04,608 --> 02:44:08,283
MATT: Okay, so you use your bonus action to
disengage. Where are you going?

1946
02:44:08,283 --> 02:44:09,808
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Grog.

1947
02:44:09,808 --> 02:44:14,961
MATT: All right, so you fly over, and where are
you going?

1948
02:44:14,961 --> 02:44:18,889
LAURA: I'm going to fly next to him and I'm going
to touch him and I'm going to cast Lesser

1949
02:44:18,889 --> 02:44:20,094
Restoration on him.

1950
02:44:20,094 --> 02:44:30,282
MATT: Okay. You use your action to cast Lesser
Restoration. So the Lesser Restoration affects--

1951
02:44:30,282 --> 02:44:31,886
LAURA: Heals blindness and deafness.

1952
02:44:31,886 --> 02:44:35,764
LIAM: Good, go to the 250 hit point guy. Good
call.

1953
02:44:35,764 --> 02:44:40,424
LAURA: He needs to be able to fucking see so he
can smith while we're trying to distract this

1954
02:44:40,424 --> 02:44:41,509
fucker.

1955
02:44:41,509 --> 02:44:44,396
MATT: The blindness fades as she touches you. Your
vision comes back.

1956
02:44:44,396 --> 02:44:47,973
TRAVIS: Cool. Oh, right, then I held my action for
that.

1957
02:44:47,973 --> 02:44:50,075
LAURA: Yeah, that's the thing, he was holding.

1958
02:44:50,075 --> 02:44:53,435
TRAVIS: Should I try and smith?

1959
02:44:53,435 --> 02:44:59,993
TALIESIN: Here's the question. I should know this:
how quickly can these things be made?

1960
02:44:59,993 --> 02:45:07,197
MATT: Well, to be honest, the process of each
trammel is going to be a 15-minute process. You

1961
02:45:07,197 --> 02:45:10,244
can't hyper-smith in the middle of battle.

1962
02:45:10,244 --> 02:45:13,193
(groaning)

1963
02:45:13,193 --> 02:45:20,137
LAURA: Well. Okay. Do I have any more movement left?

1964
02:45:20,137 --> 02:45:24,382
MATT: That's 15 minutes if it's a straight
multiple people helping circumstance.

1965
02:45:24,382 --> 02:45:26,601
LAURA: Do I have any more movement left?

1966
02:45:26,601 --> 02:45:30,537
MATT: Not really. You had to go over an arc to get
there.

1967
02:45:30,537 --> 02:45:32,518
TALIESIN: You could grab the hammer.

1968
02:45:32,518 --> 02:45:36,345
TRAVIS: Yeah, but what purpose would it serve?

1969
02:45:36,345 --> 02:45:42,879
TALIESIN: I don't know. Maybe it's a control
hammer. I don't know. I'm grasping at fucking

1970
02:45:42,879 --> 02:45:44,089
straws here.

1971
02:45:44,089 --> 02:45:45,180
MATT: Vex?

1972
02:45:45,180 --> 02:45:49,154
LAURA: That's my last level two that I cast.

1973
02:45:49,154 --> 02:45:50,709
TRAVIS: I could try.

1974
02:45:50,709 --> 02:45:52,441
TALIESIN: You've got actions.

1975
02:45:52,441 --> 02:45:55,103
LAURA: Great, so I don't have any more Lesser
Restorations. I can cast it at a higher level,

1976
02:45:55,103 --> 02:45:55,991
maybe.

1977
02:45:55,991 --> 02:46:00,026
MARISHA: You also still have Freedom of Movement
on you. You don't have anything else at all; I got

1978
02:46:00,026 --> 02:46:03,341
lost concentration. But you do have Freedom of
Movement.

1979
02:46:03,341 --> 02:46:05,605
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1980
02:46:05,638 --> 02:46:07,596
TALIESIN: Grabbing that hammer is definitely an
option.

1981
02:46:07,596 --> 02:46:10,122
LAURA: I don't know why you would grab the
hammer.

1982
02:46:10,122 --> 02:46:12,724
TRAVIS: Maybe he'd stop moving if I grabbed the
hammer?

1983
02:46:12,724 --> 02:46:14,394
MATT: Vex, is that all you're doing this turn?

1984
02:46:14,394 --> 02:46:17,334
LAURA: I mean that's all I can do. That's my
action, my bonus, and my movement.

1985
02:46:17,334 --> 02:46:19,145
MATT: Yep, all right, so Scanlan.

1986
02:46:19,145 --> 02:46:22,868
TRAVIS: Oh, but I held my action until I had
sight.

1987
02:46:22,868 --> 02:46:27,402
MATT: Correct, you have sight now. What are you
going to attack? Because you can't move, it's just

1988
02:46:27,402 --> 02:46:28,336
your action.

1989
02:46:28,336 --> 02:46:30,925
TRAVIS: You're on the hammer, aren't you?

1990
02:46:30,925 --> 02:46:31,835
TALIESIN: I let go.

1991
02:46:31,835 --> 02:46:35,467
TRAVIS: Should I try pulling up the hammer and see
if that does something? Okay, I'll try and pull

1992
02:46:35,467 --> 02:46:37,871
the chain up to grab the hammer.

1993
02:46:37,871 --> 02:46:41,401
MATT: Technically, when you're holding your action
to do something, like an attack, you can only do

1994
02:46:41,401 --> 02:46:46,775
that because it's a reaction, a very quick thing.
Basically, as soon as you get your vision you're

1995
02:46:46,775 --> 02:46:47,956
like, (panting).

1996
02:46:47,956 --> 02:46:50,992
TRAVIS: I will rage, and that's it.

1997
02:46:50,992 --> 02:46:52,360
MATT: I'll let you rage on that, sure.

1998
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:56,833
MARISHA: Can he attack the elemental that's now
rogue across from him?

1999
02:46:56,833 --> 02:47:00,290
MATT: He's not within range, unfortunately. It's
across the way.

2000
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:04,210
TRAVIS: Can I turn around and look, now that I'm
right up next to the Core Anvil, is there anything

2001
02:47:04,210 --> 02:47:08,890
that I'm noticing about it that would move or
knock off? A switch or a button?

2002
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:12,197
MATT: Make a perception check.

2003
02:47:12,197 --> 02:47:18,306
TRAVIS: Doesn't look just like a flipping anvil. Yeah,
okay, cool. That's a two.

2004
02:47:18,306 --> 02:47:21,546
LIAM: This is such a shit-show! Love it!

2005
02:47:21,546 --> 02:47:29,813
MATT: It looks like an anvil, a beautiful anvil, a
primal built, ageless anvil.

2006
02:47:29,813 --> 02:47:31,171
TRAVIS: I never see shit!

2007
02:47:31,171 --> 02:47:33,934
LIAM: Hey, that's my magic trick!

2008
02:47:33,934 --> 02:47:39,341
MATT: All right, so Scanlan. You're currently
submerged in molten metal, screaming, on fire.

2009
02:47:39,341 --> 02:47:46,786
Your turn begins and you take six points of fire
damage. You're prone and sinking into it. What are

2010
02:47:46,786 --> 02:47:47,793
you doing?

2011
02:47:47,793 --> 02:47:49,797
LAURA: You should probably get out, right?

2012
02:47:49,797 --> 02:47:56,572
SAM: I guess, yeah, probably. (laughs) I will, I
guess, save my life and Dimension Door out of

2013
02:47:56,572 --> 02:47:57,572
there.

2014
02:47:57,572 --> 02:47:59,859
MATT: Okay, you Dimension Door out of the lava?

2015
02:47:59,859 --> 02:48:03,786
SAM: Yes, please. I have no other options.

2016
02:48:03,786 --> 02:48:06,255
MATT: You can walk out of it. You're right next to
the edge.

2017
02:48:06,255 --> 02:48:09,092
SAM: Oh, I'm next to the edge?

2018
02:48:09,092 --> 02:48:12,055
MATT: Yeah, you could pull yourself out of it.

2019
02:48:12,055 --> 02:48:18,205
SAM: Oh. Well, I'll try that first with my
movement, I guess, right?

2020
02:48:18,205 --> 02:48:23,408
MATT: Yeah, with your movement you get out. You're
ten feet out of it. You're on fire still, but

2021
02:48:23,408 --> 02:48:28,605
you're no longer melting in the lava. You're hurt,
but you turn the corner and you can see the giant

2022
02:48:28,605 --> 02:48:34,723
guardian that is now currently facing off with the
rest of your allies on the other side of the

2023
02:48:34,723 --> 02:48:39,587
platform in the far corner of the room. You're
staring at its back. What are you doing?

2024
02:48:39,587 --> 02:48:50,590
SAM: Oh boy. I wasn't expecting to attack this
turn. I'll do the lightning again because it seemed

2025
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:57,505
to have some damage. No, you know what? We've got
to block his sword, right? Shit. I will Bigby's

2026
02:48:57,505 --> 02:48:59,385
Hand and try to grapple his sword.

2027
02:48:59,385 --> 02:49:03,695
MATT: Okay, you're doing another Bigby's Hand? And
you'll attempt to grapple his sword?

2028
02:49:03,695 --> 02:49:04,893
SAM: Yes.

2029
02:49:04,893 --> 02:49:05,990
MATT: All righty.

2030
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:08,829
SAM: I don't know if that's going to work at all.

2031
02:49:08,829 --> 02:49:12,719
MATT: Well, let's give it a shot. Bigby's Hand
moves over here.

2032
02:49:12,719 --> 02:49:17,672
LIAM: Oh, he's dead! He's dead, Matt. Game over.

2033
02:49:17,672 --> 02:49:24,824
MATT: If we go by that tactic, Bigby's Hand's
dead. You've all died. I'll put him there.

2034
02:49:24,824 --> 02:49:38,673
Percival has been dead for a long time. We'll put
that there. That's good. There you go. All right.

2035
02:49:38,673 --> 02:49:48,487
LAURA: I want to try to move Bigby's Hand to hold
on to his arm. Can I try it?

2036
02:49:48,487 --> 02:49:51,424
MATT: If you want to. Grasping Hand?

2037
02:49:51,424 --> 02:49:55,932
SAM: I guess. This is supposed to be against a
creature, not against an item.

2038
02:49:55,932 --> 02:49:59,660
MATT: Right, I'm letting you do this, though. It's
fine. It makes sense. It's big enough. Make an

2039
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:03,859
athletics check, using the strength of Bigby's
Hand, which is a plus eight. Roll a d20 and add

2040
02:50:03,859 --> 02:50:05,130
eight to it.

2041
02:50:05,130 --> 02:50:07,881
SAM: It's a 19.

2042
02:50:07,881 --> 02:50:10,687
LIAM: Blessed! Hashtag blessed!

2043
02:50:10,687 --> 02:50:12,186
SAM: 19.

2044
02:50:12,186 --> 02:50:13,434
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

2045
02:50:13,434 --> 02:50:16,104
SAM: Plus three, so that's 22.

2046
02:50:16,104 --> 02:50:18,067
MATT: 22. It rolled a 19.

2047
02:50:18,067 --> 02:50:19,986
(cheering)

2048
02:50:19,986 --> 02:50:24,750
MATT: It is grappling the blade. What that means
is, for the purposes of this, all of its attacks

2049
02:50:24,750 --> 02:50:28,168
are at disadvantage until it can break free from
Bigby holding the blade.

2050
02:50:28,168 --> 02:50:29,924
LIAM: Bigby's Hand!

2051
02:50:29,924 --> 02:50:33,371
MATT: That's your turn, unless you want to use a
bonus action for something.

2052
02:50:33,371 --> 02:50:37,349
SAM: I will use a bonus action to level two Healing
Word myself.

2053
02:50:37,349 --> 02:50:38,524
MATT: Go for it.

2054
02:50:38,524 --> 02:50:46,852
SAM: I will sing, (singing) I'm freaked out by the
shape of me! I'm burned up and nobody can see. So

2055
02:50:46,852 --> 02:50:52,515
you know what I'll do to thee? Give some health to
my body. (vocalizing)

2056
02:50:52,515 --> 02:50:56,563
(laughter)

2057
02:50:56,563 --> 02:51:07,392
MATT: Damn it, Sam. Take your 2d4 plus six.
Finishing that out, it is the elemental's turn.

2058
02:51:07,392 --> 02:51:14,414
MARISHA: He is slowly steaming away, right,
because it's so hot?

2059
02:51:14,414 --> 02:51:18,008
MATT: You're not going to rules-lawyer me out of
the elemental.

2060
02:51:18,008 --> 02:51:21,136
(laughter)

2061
02:51:21,136 --> 02:51:29,429
MATT: It makes a slam attack against both Vex and
Grog. Vex, that's a 15 plus seven, 22. And Grog,

2062
02:51:29,429 --> 02:51:34,419
that's a 17 plus seven, 24. What's the bludgeoning
damage from the elemental?

2063
02:51:34,419 --> 02:51:39,590
MARISHA: It's 2d8 plus four.

2064
02:51:39,590 --> 02:51:50,827
MATT: Vex, you take 15 points of bludgeoning
damage. Grog, you take 11 points of bludgeoning

2065
02:51:50,827 --> 02:51:53,034
damage, reduced to five.

2066
02:51:53,097 --> 02:51:54,704
LIAM: Where you at, big guy?

2067
02:51:54,704 --> 02:51:56,007
TRAVIS: 190.

2068
02:51:56,007 --> 02:51:59,908
MATT: Grog and Keyleth. Your turn. Keyleth, you
now have complete control of your form.

2069
02:51:59,908 --> 02:52:09,241
MARISHA: Now people know why I don't conjure that
many elementals. I'm going to go fly away, since

2070
02:52:09,241 --> 02:52:18,394
Grog is now fine. Go over to my boyfriend. Would
it be part of my movement to grab him and pull him

2071
02:52:18,394 --> 02:52:21,682
away a little bit, and then can I still have an
action, or would that be my action?

2072
02:52:21,682 --> 02:52:23,391
MATT: No, that would be your action.

2073
02:52:23,391 --> 02:52:36,479
MARISHA: Then I'm going to fly by and do a Healing
Touch on you. You get 6d8 plus three hit points

2074
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:38,472
and you are freed from your blindness.

2075
02:52:38,472 --> 02:52:40,624
LIAM: Oh, I love you so much!

2076
02:52:40,624 --> 02:52:46,255
LAURA: That's amazing! Hey, Scanlan, you should
have done that before. That would have been really cool.

2077
02:52:46,255 --> 02:52:48,300
LIAM: Holy shit!

2078
02:52:48,300 --> 02:53:07,020
MARISHA: 12 plus four, 15. No, 16. Plus another
three brings us to 19. Plus another four brings us

2079
02:53:07,020 --> 02:53:15,519
to 22. 23. And then a three brings us to 26 hit
points and you are cleared from your blindness.

2080
02:53:15,519 --> 02:53:25,362
Can I use the rest of my fly speed of 120 feet
like my boyfriend to then fly away?

2081
02:53:25,362 --> 02:53:27,251
MATT: Certainly. Which direction?

2082
02:53:27,251 --> 02:53:36,196
MARISHA: I want to go back and over on this side.
Yeah, a little bit closer. Yeah.

2083
02:53:36,196 --> 02:53:42,622
MATT: You fly over. As you swing, it glances in
your direction and with a reaction, gets an attack

2084
02:53:42,622 --> 02:53:51,588
of opportunity on you with disadvantage. That's
20. What's your armor class in the planetar form?

2085
02:53:51,588 --> 02:54:00,896
LIAM: Captain Planet AC is 29.

2086
02:54:00,896 --> 02:54:04,215
MARISHA: 19, so it hits me.

2087
02:54:04,215 --> 02:54:08,852
LIAM: Hashtag blessed, though!

2088
02:54:08,852 --> 02:54:09,995
MARISHA: I am blessed!

2089
02:54:09,995 --> 02:54:16,706
MATT: Doesn't add to your armor class. It's
attacks and saving throws. It's a level one spell,

2090
02:54:16,706 --> 02:54:36,693
guys. It hits you. You take... 42 points of
slashing damage, and I need you to make a

2091
02:54:36,693 --> 02:54:38,613
constitution saving throw.

2092
02:54:38,613 --> 02:54:40,643
LAURA: You can't be blinded as a planetar, can
you?

2093
02:54:40,643 --> 02:54:44,174
MATT: You are not immune to blindness as a
planetar.

2094
02:54:44,174 --> 02:54:46,986
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

2095
02:54:46,986 --> 02:54:53,586
LAURA: There's no way to run away from him. We
have to either defeat him or find a way to

2096
02:54:53,586 --> 02:54:54,894
disengage him.

2097
02:54:54,894 --> 02:54:59,575
MARISHA: Is it con as me or con as the dude?

2098
02:54:59,575 --> 02:55:03,629
TRAVIS: There are four chains hanging off of the
thing, and we all know the hammer is attached to one.

2099
02:55:03,629 --> 02:55:07,486
TALIESIN: The rest are other tools.

2100
02:55:07,486 --> 02:55:11,033
MARISHA: Do I take my planetar's constitution?

2101
02:55:11,033 --> 02:55:12,592
MATT: Yes. That's plus seven.

2102
02:55:12,592 --> 02:55:16,648
MARISHA: That's cool, but then I still have my war
caster ability, too, right? I have advantage?

2103
02:55:16,648 --> 02:55:21,580
MATT: No, that's against concentration, so you
will have to do that in a second, but first, this

2104
02:55:21,580 --> 02:55:25,890
is to see if you go blind or not. This is a curse
effect.

2105
02:55:25,890 --> 02:55:28,496
TRAVIS: Don't they have truesight and stuff?

2106
02:55:28,496 --> 02:55:32,074
MARISHA: I do have truesight as a planetar. It is
pretty good, so that's 27.

2107
02:55:32,074 --> 02:55:36,202
MATT: 27? Okay. You resist the blindness. However,
now half that damage.

2108
02:55:36,202 --> 02:55:38,337
MARISHA: You said 42?

2109
02:55:38,337 --> 02:55:45,407
MATT: So half of that is 21, so DC 21. Make a
constitution saving throw with advantage.

2110
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:47,115
TALIESIN: With a d4.

2111
02:55:47,115 --> 02:55:52,286
MARISHA: I'm good. 17 plus my constitution?

2112
02:55:52,286 --> 02:55:59,098
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. So you maintain
concentration on your form. Perfect. That finishes

2113
02:55:59,098 --> 02:56:01,183
Keyleth's turn. Grog, what are you doing?

2114
02:56:01,183 --> 02:56:16,965
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's hammer time. I'm going to run
down here-- five, ten, 15-- right there, to this side.

2115
02:56:16,965 --> 02:56:20,804
MATT: Perfect, you can get up right against there.
The elemental gets one swing at you as you go out

2116
02:56:20,804 --> 02:56:27,087
of its range. That is a three plus seven. Ten. It
hits your back and it's like, ooh. It's kind of cool.

2117
02:56:27,087 --> 02:56:38,320
TRAVIS: And I'll take both of my attacks at the
giant death-bringer. Just reckless, not great

2118
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:45,663
weapon master. Hoping for a crit, which was not
it. 31.

2119
02:56:45,663 --> 02:56:46,785
MATT: Hits.

2120
02:56:46,785 --> 02:56:54,344
TRAVIS: Great. That's better. 32.

2121
02:56:54,344 --> 02:56:56,881
MATT: Hits. These are both with the minus five?

2122
02:56:56,881 --> 02:57:05,849
TRAVIS: No, not great weapon master. Just
reckless. Six, 22 for the first one.

2123
02:57:05,849 --> 02:57:07,011
MATT: Okay.

2124
02:57:07,011 --> 02:57:18,501
TRAVIS: And I can't disarm him; he's a giant. And
20 for the second one.

2125
02:57:18,501 --> 02:57:24,503
LAURA: His weapon is grappled right now, so I
don't know if you'd have advantage on trying to

2126
02:57:24,503 --> 02:57:25,495
disarm him.

2127
02:57:25,495 --> 02:57:26,755
TRAVIS: He's gargantuan, though.

2128
02:57:26,755 --> 02:57:28,447
LIAM: He's already at a negative because of
Bigby.

2129
02:57:28,447 --> 02:57:29,580
MATT: All right.

2130
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:31,185
TRAVIS: And that is it.

2131
02:57:31,185 --> 02:57:36,984
MATT: That is it? All right. So that ends your
turn. At the end of your turn, Grog, it's going to

2132
02:57:36,984 --> 02:57:44,832
go ahead and use its legendary action to swing
back at you as you're hitting it. So you slam it

2133
02:57:44,832 --> 02:57:51,315
in the back with the axe, as it angrily
swings a wide strike towards its back, hoping to

2134
02:57:51,315 --> 02:57:57,930
catch the side of your chest, with disadvantage,
that is an eight plus 14. 22.

2135
02:57:57,930 --> 02:57:58,957
TRAVIS: That hits.

2136
02:57:58,957 --> 02:58:09,893
MATT: That hits. Okay. You take 27 points of
slashing damage, reduced to be 13.

2137
02:58:09,893 --> 02:58:13,424
TRAVIS: Can I use my stone's endurance to reduce
that further?

2138
02:58:13,424 --> 02:58:16,595
MATT: If you want to, or you can take a
retaliation shot. Up to you. Don't forget your

2139
02:58:16,595 --> 02:58:17,525
retaliation.

2140
02:58:17,525 --> 02:58:21,389
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to do it afterwards. I
thought he did two hits backwards?

2141
02:58:21,389 --> 02:58:24,255
MATT: Well, stone's endurance is a reaction. You
get one reaction, so it's one or the other. I'm

2142
02:58:24,255 --> 02:58:25,540
pretty sure it is. I'll double check.

2143
02:58:25,540 --> 02:58:29,030
TALIESIN: I feel like we're missing at something
really hard.

2144
02:58:29,030 --> 02:58:30,704
MATT: Essentially.

2145
02:58:30,704 --> 02:58:34,731
LAURA: I feel like he's invulnerable.

2146
02:58:34,731 --> 02:58:40,276
MATT: Yeah, you can use your reactions. It's one
or the other.

2147
02:58:40,276 --> 02:58:41,974
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah. I'll do the retaliation.

2148
02:58:41,974 --> 02:58:47,073
MATT: All right, cool. You take the 13 damage.
Constitution saving throw, please.

2149
02:58:47,073 --> 02:58:53,435
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh shit. It's that fucking sword.
Right.

2150
02:58:53,435 --> 02:58:55,476
SAM: You have inspiration.

2151
02:58:55,476 --> 02:59:09,972
TRAVIS: Thank you. Going to need it. 20. I'm going
to use my inspiration. 28.

2152
02:59:09,972 --> 02:59:13,327
MATT: 28. You resist it. No issue. So now you can
take your retaliation shot.

2153
02:59:13,327 --> 02:59:24,987
TRAVIS: Okay! Reckless, great weapon master. Why
not? That's 31 minus five, that's 26?

2154
02:59:24,987 --> 02:59:26,812
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

2155
02:59:26,812 --> 02:59:32,396
TRAVIS: Nice. Fuck. 27.

2156
02:59:32,396 --> 02:59:33,932
MATT: 27 points of damage.

2157
02:59:33,932 --> 02:59:41,300
TRAVIS: That was a shit roll. I rolled a one. Oh!
I reroll ones! Sorry. Reroll ones. Thanks. 12!

2158
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:42,462
That's way better!

2159
02:59:42,462 --> 02:59:43,822
(cheering)

2160
02:59:43,822 --> 02:59:44,982
MATT: That's an extra 11 damage on it.

2161
02:59:44,982 --> 02:59:46,182
TRAVIS: 28, 38.

2162
02:59:46,182 --> 02:59:51,443
MATT: 38 damage. There you go. So as you resist
the effect, you come back with a third strike,

2163
02:59:51,443 --> 02:59:56,130
slamming it into the back, and you can watch some
of the armor in the back cracks. You can see bits

2164
02:59:56,130 --> 03:00:04,451
of glowing orange in places. It's still looking
fine, but it's taking hits. It isn't impervious.

2165
03:00:04,451 --> 03:00:07,812
MARISHA: This is why I wanted a stupid water
elemental.

2166
03:00:07,812 --> 03:00:11,186
LIAM: He's on death's door, guys. We got him.

2167
03:00:11,186 --> 03:00:13,352
MATT: That brings us to Percival's turn.

2168
03:00:13,352 --> 03:00:19,884
TALIESIN: I'm going to run all the way back to the
back of the room, I'm going to put as much

2169
03:00:19,884 --> 03:00:26,929
distance-- well, actually I'll take my shots
first. I've got Animus up, so I'm going to spend a

2170
03:00:26,929 --> 03:00:37,199
point on it. I'm running out of grit. And I'm
going to try and take a shot on this guy.

2171
03:00:37,199 --> 03:00:42,069
LAURA: I'm just above you telling you how hot you look as
you're doing it.

2172
03:00:42,069 --> 03:00:44,515
MARISHA: Physically, you're really sweaty right
now.

2173
03:00:44,515 --> 03:00:49,456
LIAM: Your hair is so white. You're like Steve
Martin without the ukulele. I'm just so turned on

2174
03:00:49,456 --> 03:00:50,487
by you.

2175
03:00:50,487 --> 03:00:58,435
TALIESIN: 36. That hits, I assume, so that's 1d10
plus 1d6, and then I'm also going to blow the last

2176
03:00:58,435 --> 03:01:08,173
of my lightning into that, as well. That's 18
points of standard damage, two points of psychic

2177
03:01:08,173 --> 03:01:15,202
damage, and 15 points of lightning damage.

2178
03:01:15,202 --> 03:01:20,122
MATT: Nice. 35 total on that shot.

2179
03:01:20,122 --> 03:01:34,144
TALIESIN: That's one shot. This is my last
advantage shot. I'm going to take another

2180
03:01:34,144 --> 03:01:36,816
advantage shot on him. Here we go.

2181
03:01:36,816 --> 03:01:38,804
TRAVIS: Come on, dude.

2182
03:01:38,804 --> 03:01:45,950
TALIESIN: That's 24 on the advantage shot.

2183
03:01:45,950 --> 03:01:47,397
MATT: 24 just hits.

2184
03:01:47,397 --> 03:01:49,168
(cheering)

2185
03:01:49,168 --> 03:01:50,484
TRAVIS: That's what it is. 24.

2186
03:01:50,484 --> 03:02:02,373
TALIESIN: Here we go. 15 points of damage plus
three points of psychic damage. I should start

2187
03:02:02,373 --> 03:02:16,547
taking track of this. Shooting again, no
advantage. 20.

2188
03:02:16,547 --> 03:02:18,265
MATT: 20 does not hit.

2189
03:02:18,265 --> 03:02:22,858
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn an action surge and
take three more shots. And I'll roll 3d20.

2190
03:02:22,858 --> 03:02:33,170
Actually, hold on. No, it wouldn't matter. 22, yeah
it doesn't actually hit. So here we go. Taking

2191
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:46,630
three shots. Oh my god! So this is great. I take
three more shots. First one is 29, so that hits.

2192
03:02:46,630 --> 03:02:48,863
LIAM: If any of those miss, you're blessed.

2193
03:02:48,863 --> 03:02:54,032
TALIESIN: No, they did not. So this is going to be
fine. I did roll the other two. 19 and 19, which

2194
03:02:54,032 --> 03:02:59,765
are both criticals. I got two criticals that we're
going to get into. First shot is not a critical.

2195
03:02:59,765 --> 03:03:08,780
That's 12 points of damage and one point of
psychic damage. And then let me get an extra d10

2196
03:03:08,780 --> 03:03:14,982
and an extra d6. This is weird. New critical. New
type of critical.

2197
03:03:14,982 --> 03:03:22,252
MATT: Takes half of the critical damage next turn.
What was the total on that last one?

2198
03:03:22,252 --> 03:03:24,055
TRAVIS: 26.

2199
03:03:24,055 --> 03:03:26,108
MATT: All right. So critical damage.

2200
03:03:26,108 --> 03:03:33,013
TALIESIN: Critical damage. That's 11 points of
psychic damage.

2201
03:03:33,013 --> 03:03:39,677
MATT: The psychic damage is doubled, too, by the
way.

2202
03:03:39,677 --> 03:03:46,797
TALIESIN: Yeah! And 20 points of normal damage. 20
normal and 11 points of psychic.

2203
03:03:46,797 --> 03:03:48,077
MATT: Okay, so 31.

2204
03:03:48,077 --> 03:03:49,814
TALIESIN: And now the next critical hit.

2205
03:03:49,814 --> 03:03:53,774
LIAM: (whispering) Yes. Yes, Percival.

2206
03:03:53,774 --> 03:03:55,578
TRAVIS: Come on, you sweet chinchilla.

2207
03:03:55,578 --> 03:04:02,855
TALIESIN: Oh my god. That's a terrible roll.
That's okay. 12 points of normal damage and six

2208
03:04:02,855 --> 03:04:04,492
points of psychic damage.

2209
03:04:04,492 --> 03:04:05,843
MATT: So 18.

2210
03:04:05,843 --> 03:04:10,996
TALIESIN: And so the two of those combined, cut in
half, is what he takes next round's bleed damage.

2211
03:04:10,996 --> 03:04:14,101
MATT: Yeah. Which is 49, so he'll be taking 24
points of bleed damage.

2212
03:04:14,101 --> 03:04:15,963
TALIESIN: I'm running in the opposite direction!

2213
03:04:15,963 --> 03:04:17,914
LIAM: You broken bastard.

2214
03:04:17,914 --> 03:04:20,888
MATT: So you run around this way.

2215
03:04:20,888 --> 03:04:27,131
TALIESIN: Oh, and that's two crits, which means I
get two grits back. I'm like (grunts) that way.

2216
03:04:27,131 --> 03:04:31,984
MATT: This is as far as you can get. If you want
to go that way, you'll have to go around in lava,

2217
03:04:31,984 --> 03:04:36,465
so you have to go around. That's as far as you can
get there. That ends your turn, Percival. All

2218
03:04:36,465 --> 03:04:42,506
right, at the end of your turn it's going to use
its third and final legendary action to hack down

2219
03:04:42,506 --> 03:04:44,312
at you because you're up next.

2220
03:04:44,312 --> 03:04:50,501
LIAM: Bring it. I have no fear.

2221
03:04:50,501 --> 03:04:52,222
MATT: All right, so that is a 25.

2222
03:04:52,222 --> 03:04:53,256
LIAM: Hits.

2223
03:04:53,256 --> 03:04:54,210
MATT: All right.

2224
03:04:54,210 --> 03:04:55,359
SAM: That was with disadvantage?

2225
03:04:55,359 --> 03:04:56,305
MATT and TRAVIS: Yeah.

2226
03:04:56,305 --> 03:04:57,269
SAM: Damn.

2227
03:04:57,269 --> 03:04:58,749
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge. Halve it.

2228
03:04:58,749 --> 03:05:01,333
MATT: 33 points of slashing damage.

2229
03:05:01,333 --> 03:05:02,760
LIAM: Okay, halved.

2230
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:07,059
MATT: All right, so it'll be 16, and I want you to
make a constitution saving throw.

2231
03:05:07,059 --> 03:05:10,175
LAURA: Right after you were healed.

2232
03:05:10,175 --> 03:05:12,364
TALIESIN: This is just what you're going to be
doing.

2233
03:05:12,364 --> 03:05:14,378
MARISHA: That's why I went there.

2234
03:05:14,378 --> 03:05:18,918
LIAM: That gets me to 18.

2235
03:05:18,918 --> 03:05:23,351
MATT: 18, not enough. The darkness takes over
again in your eyes. It's still there in front of

2236
03:05:23,351 --> 03:05:30,425
you, you know where it is, but your vision is
taken from you. That is going to end that. It's

2237
03:05:30,425 --> 03:05:31,895
now your turn.

2238
03:05:31,895 --> 03:05:38,892
LIAM: I hate holding my turn, because I don't
understand it. If I hold my turn, I can only

2239
03:05:38,892 --> 03:05:40,680
attack when it gets back to me, right?

2240
03:05:40,680 --> 03:05:42,208
MATT: Depends on whatever action you decide to
hold.

2241
03:05:42,208 --> 03:05:45,628
LIAM: Can I hold my turn to cast Vow of Enmity
until I can see again?

2242
03:05:45,628 --> 03:05:46,879
MATT: You can do that if you want to.

2243
03:05:46,879 --> 03:05:50,584
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn until I can
fucking see to cast Vow of Enmity and attack.

2244
03:05:50,584 --> 03:05:53,980
MATT: So you're expecting somebody else in your
party to come heal you?

2245
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:57,330
LIAM: I'm going to do fuck all without it. Yes.
That's what I'm doing.

2246
03:05:57,330 --> 03:05:58,580
MATT: Okay, all right.

2247
03:05:58,580 --> 03:06:02,668
TALIESIN: You can move. You have a bonus action.

2248
03:06:02,668 --> 03:06:04,394
LAURA: Well, bonus action is Vow of Enmity.

2249
03:06:04,394 --> 03:06:09,010
LIAM: This guy can get anywhere. He has shown us
that he can get anywhere on this map. There's no

2250
03:06:09,010 --> 03:06:12,002
point going anywhere. No, I'm going to stay put.
That's what I'm doing. I've already called it.

2251
03:06:12,002 --> 03:06:16,818
MATT: Okay, so Vax is going to hold that. It's now
his turn. Let's see if he gets the blade storm

2252
03:06:16,818 --> 03:06:26,013
back. Does! He does get the blade storm back. So
he's going to leap and land up here in the center.

2253
03:06:26,013 --> 03:06:27,073
Oh god.

2254
03:06:27,073 --> 03:06:29,349
LAURA: (singing) Bigby's Hand!

2255
03:06:29,349 --> 03:06:32,323
TALIESIN: Oh, that also means he takes his bleed
damage this turn.

2256
03:06:32,323 --> 03:06:34,243
MATT: It does, yeah. So we're going to go ahead
and put this over here.

2257
03:06:34,243 --> 03:06:36,113
LIAM: Can anybody do an attack of opportunity?

2258
03:06:36,113 --> 03:06:38,635
TRAVIS: I do.

2259
03:06:38,635 --> 03:06:42,175
LIAM: And then, can I get an attack of opportunity
even though I'm holding? I have no idea.

2260
03:06:42,175 --> 03:06:43,534
MATT: You will, yes.

2261
03:06:43,534 --> 03:06:51,703
TALIESIN: I'm so excited by how you're doing this
here. This is some crazy shit.

2262
03:06:51,703 --> 03:06:54,032
LAURA: It's the sword. It throws him off balance.

2263
03:06:54,032 --> 03:06:57,067
MARISHA: He's been doing his yogas, though.

2264
03:06:57,067 --> 03:07:11,830
MATT: So takes another 24 damage, all righty. Both
you guys get attacks of opportunity.

2265
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:18,380
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon master. 30.

2266
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:19,776
MATT: Hits.

2267
03:07:19,776 --> 03:07:24,623
TRAVIS: Okay. For 30 points of damage.

2268
03:07:24,623 --> 03:07:30,789
MATT: (crash) It takes the hit, it lands. Go ahead
and make your attack.

2269
03:07:30,789 --> 03:07:34,218
LIAM: Okay, so I had him flanked with Grog, right,
because he was right between the two of us? So

2270
03:07:34,218 --> 03:07:36,185
down to regular attack.

2271
03:07:36,185 --> 03:07:37,082
MATT: Correct.

2272
03:07:37,082 --> 03:07:41,396
LIAM: Good. That hits. That's 18 plus a lot. Plus
14.

2273
03:07:41,396 --> 03:07:44,451
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

2274
03:07:44,451 --> 03:08:00,448
LIAM: That is 11, plus psychic damage is 13, plus
these fuckers. (counting) 35.

2275
03:08:00,448 --> 03:08:05,236
MATT: Okay, takes 35 damage, and the blindness
fades.

2276
03:08:05,236 --> 03:08:08,015
MARISHA: Wait, how did you do that?

2277
03:08:08,015 --> 03:08:12,391
LAURA: His concentration, maybe?

2278
03:08:12,391 --> 03:08:13,869
LIAM: Yeah, maybe because I cut a bit?

2279
03:08:13,869 --> 03:08:19,462
MATT: It seems less concentration. You get the
sense that the blindness lasts until you hit it.

2280
03:08:19,462 --> 03:08:20,899
LIAM: Can I see now?

2281
03:08:20,899 --> 03:08:21,891
MATT: You can now see.

2282
03:08:21,891 --> 03:08:23,443
LIAM: So now I can do my held turn.

2283
03:08:23,443 --> 03:08:24,377
MATT: Yes, you can.

2284
03:08:24,377 --> 03:08:28,781
LIAM: Am I within ten feet? I'll move forward a
bit.

2285
03:08:28,781 --> 03:08:31,725
MATT: Well, you held your action, not your turn.
There's a difference.

2286
03:08:31,725 --> 03:08:34,522
LIAM: Okay, but he's near--

2287
03:08:34,522 --> 03:08:37,639
MATT: I will say, the minute you hit him and the
vision comes back, I'll allow you to do it.

2288
03:08:37,639 --> 03:08:44,527
LIAM: Well, wait. Is he within ten feet of Grog,
would you say? His foot?

2289
03:08:44,527 --> 03:08:46,413
MATT: Sure, I'll let it happen.

2290
03:08:46,413 --> 03:08:47,728
LIAM: Well, I'm going to save it, then.

2291
03:08:47,728 --> 03:08:50,724
LAURA: No, he said you were in range. He was in
range right when you moved.

2292
03:08:50,724 --> 03:08:55,426
LIAM: I understand that. I'm weighing multiple
options, dear. No, I will cast Vow of Enmity. I'll

2293
03:08:55,426 --> 03:08:57,572
cast it on my bonus action, then attack, attack.

2294
03:08:57,572 --> 03:09:01,317
MATT: You held your action as Vow of Enmity.

2295
03:09:01,317 --> 03:09:08,228
LIAM: To attack, right, to attack. Which was to
cast Vow of Enmity and not to attack, as well?

2296
03:09:08,228 --> 03:09:13,616
MATT: You can't hold your whole turn. You hold an
action.

2297
03:09:13,616 --> 03:09:15,264
LIAM: Vow of Enmity.

2298
03:09:15,264 --> 03:09:21,991
MATT: So as it lands there, it uses blade storm,
(crash) strikes around as it sweeps everyone in a

2299
03:09:21,991 --> 03:09:28,285
15-foot radius, which will be Grog, Vax, Vex, the
elemental, and Scanlan.

2300
03:09:28,285 --> 03:09:31,796
LAURA: Aw, he can even get Scanlan? But he's so
little!

2301
03:09:31,796 --> 03:09:36,102
SAM: Am I still holding on to his sword?

2302
03:09:36,102 --> 03:09:44,625
MATT: With Bigby, you are, so disadvantage on all
these attacks, correct. So against Scanlan, that

2303
03:09:44,625 --> 03:09:50,309
is, hah. Avoided a natural 20 because of that. So
that instead is going to be a 22.

2304
03:09:50,309 --> 03:09:51,721
SAM: That hits.

2305
03:09:51,721 --> 03:09:59,683
MATT: All righty. Against Vax is a 29.

2306
03:09:59,683 --> 03:10:00,860
LIAM: (scoffs) Yeah.

2307
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:06,810
MATT: All right, against Grog. That is a 21.

2308
03:10:06,810 --> 03:10:08,049
TRAVIS: Yep.

2309
03:10:08,049 --> 03:10:12,082
MATT: And against Vex is a 24.

2310
03:10:12,082 --> 03:10:15,290
LAURA: Ooh, that hits. And the elemental.

2311
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:21,370
MATT: Elemental is an 18.

2312
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:23,260
MARISHA: Hits. Armor class 14.

2313
03:10:23,260 --> 03:10:37,259
MATT: Yeah. All right, so each of you suffers 44
points of slashing damage.

2314
03:10:37,259 --> 03:10:38,616
LAURA: I'm going to uncanny dodge.

2315
03:10:38,616 --> 03:10:39,823
MATT: Okay, so 22.

2316
03:10:39,823 --> 03:10:42,243
LIAM: And I've already used my uncanny dodge in
this round, I think.

2317
03:10:42,243 --> 03:10:45,919
MATT: Yes, because when he took his turn, you
did.

2318
03:10:45,919 --> 03:10:47,215
LIAM: Yeah, so mine is 44 for me.

2319
03:10:47,215 --> 03:10:52,039
MATT: 44 to the elemental; you'll want to keep
track of that.

2320
03:10:52,039 --> 03:10:53,313
MARISHA: Yep, I'm on it.

2321
03:10:53,313 --> 03:10:59,036
MATT: And then 22 to you. And I need all of you to
make constitution saving throws.

2322
03:10:59,036 --> 03:11:00,703
TRAVIS: Come on, baby!

2323
03:11:00,703 --> 03:11:04,495
MATT: The elemental fails.

2324
03:11:04,495 --> 03:11:07,384
TALIESIN: It's a blind elemental

2325
03:11:07,384 --> 03:11:16,809
MARISHA: Nope, it can be blinded! He's got 70 hit
points. He hasn't taken any more damage, correct?

2326
03:11:16,809 --> 03:11:20,196
LAURA: Oh no! Ugh!

2327
03:11:20,196 --> 03:11:22,592
MARISHA: Who's blind?

2328
03:11:22,592 --> 03:11:23,979
LAURA: I'm blind!

2329
03:11:23,979 --> 03:11:25,985
MARISHA: You're blind? Is Grog blind, as well?

2330
03:11:25,985 --> 03:11:29,844
TRAVIS: But I'm in melee, so if he leaves, I can
hit him.

2331
03:11:29,844 --> 03:11:33,003
TALIESIN: Yeah, and the minute you take your turn,
you can make a reckless attack.

2332
03:11:33,003 --> 03:11:34,265
LIAM: Blind. Wow.

2333
03:11:34,265 --> 03:11:37,507
MATT: Scanlan, what's your constitution saving
throw?

2334
03:11:37,507 --> 03:11:39,911
SAM: I made a 23.

2335
03:11:39,911 --> 03:11:41,499
MATT: Scanlan resists it.

2336
03:11:41,499 --> 03:11:49,395
LIAM: That's you, and you, and Scanlan.

2337
03:11:49,395 --> 03:11:52,301
MATT: So now, Scanlan, I need you to make a
concentration check on Bigby's Hand now.

2338
03:11:52,301 --> 03:11:56,598
MARISHA: War caster. You have advantage!

2339
03:11:56,598 --> 03:12:00,000
MATT: So DC 22, because it was 44 damage. So you
have advantage.

2340
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,584
SAM: The first one was that poop thing again.

2341
03:12:03,584 --> 03:12:04,731
MATT: Okay, so one.

2342
03:12:04,731 --> 03:12:09,900
SAM: Second one, I only rolled a seven, so I'm
sure this is not going to add up to something good.

2343
03:12:09,900 --> 03:12:14,045
LIAM: What's your save? What did you roll?

2344
03:12:14,045 --> 03:12:16,344
MARISHA: Yeah, are you sure the poop is the one?

2345
03:12:16,344 --> 03:12:18,471
MATT: Yeah, the poop is a one, we already covered
that.

2346
03:12:18,471 --> 03:12:19,723
SAM: What am I adding to this, Matt?

2347
03:12:19,723 --> 03:12:21,101
MATT: Your constitution saving throw.

2348
03:12:21,101 --> 03:12:23,008
LIAM and MATT: Plus 1d4.

2349
03:12:23,008 --> 03:12:30,436
SAM: Okay, I'm still not going to hit 22. This is
a check, though, so I could inspire myself,

2350
03:12:30,436 --> 03:12:31,319
maybe?

2351
03:12:31,319 --> 03:12:32,677
MATT: It's not a check, it's a saving throw.

2352
03:12:32,677 --> 03:12:35,832
SAM: Okay, then it can max out at 20.

2353
03:12:35,832 --> 03:12:38,719
MATT: Well, 20 is the max. That's what you're
trying to hit. The DC is 20.

2354
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:44,676
SAM: Oh! Okay, well then I will roll my d4 and
see if I can hit it. I only rolled a three, not a four.

2355
03:12:44,676 --> 03:12:46,343
(groaning)

2356
03:12:46,343 --> 03:12:53,490
MATT: Bigby fades. No longer holding the weapon,
the hand fades and the blade is now no longer held

2357
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:57,044
back. The creature's looking pretty hurt, but it's
still hanging in there.

2358
03:12:57,044 --> 03:13:02,888
TRAVIS: All I see is wicked Davy Jones wanting to
chop us to pieces.

2359
03:13:02,888 --> 03:13:04,647
MATT: End of his turn, Vex, you're up.

2360
03:13:04,647 --> 03:13:06,699
SAM: Who's up?

2361
03:13:06,699 --> 03:13:07,688
MATT: Vex's turn.

2362
03:13:07,688 --> 03:13:12,358
LAURA: Do I remember where he was? Can I shoot in
his general vicinity, even though I'm blind?

2363
03:13:12,358 --> 03:13:14,989
TRAVIS: Yeah, please, shoot me in the neck.

2364
03:13:14,989 --> 03:13:17,194
MARISHA: I thought you said, "can I shoot at his
genitals?"

2365
03:13:17,194 --> 03:13:25,889
LIAM: Is Grog close enough for flanking for her?

2366
03:13:25,889 --> 03:13:40,783
LAURA: 21 won't hit him, right? Okay, so I'm going
to try it again. Goddamn it. No, it's at

2367
03:13:40,783 --> 03:13:44,006
disadvantage. Neither of them hit.

2368
03:13:44,006 --> 03:13:48,692
MATT: Both arrows go wide, disappearing into the
smoke of the room. You still hear the machine,

2369
03:13:48,692 --> 03:13:51,529
(booming), behind you.

2370
03:13:51,529 --> 03:14:01,748
LAURA: Okay. Let's see if this is-- nope, it's an
action because I'm a genius. I'm going to back up.

2371
03:14:01,748 --> 03:14:09,282
I don't know if that'll do anything. I'm going to
disengage and I'm going to back up on my broom.

2372
03:14:09,282 --> 03:14:11,401
MATT: Okay, make a perception check with
disadvantage.

2373
03:14:11,401 --> 03:14:19,453
LAURA: Great. I'm rolling so good tonight. Shush.
17.

2374
03:14:19,453 --> 03:14:25,395
MATT: 17. Because your training saved you, you
pull back and you manage to hear the echoes of the

2375
03:14:25,395 --> 03:14:29,375
bubbling and the sounds nearby. You know where the
stairs are, and you don't fall off of them.

2376
03:14:29,375 --> 03:14:31,188
LAURA: Oh, I'm on my broom, so I was flying
backwards.

2377
03:14:31,188 --> 03:14:37,313
MATT: Okay, well if that's the case then you
managed to drift backward. How far back do you

2378
03:14:37,313 --> 03:14:38,298
want to go?

2379
03:14:38,298 --> 03:14:40,204
LAURA: As far back as I can without dying.

2380
03:14:40,204 --> 03:14:44,574
MATT: Well, you're going to pull back and then
slam into the wall over here, because you're not

2381
03:14:44,574 --> 03:14:52,863
quite sure where that is. So we'll say you're
there. That ends your turn, Vex. At the end of

2382
03:14:52,863 --> 03:14:58,973
your turn, the forge guardian's going to use,
let's see--

2383
03:14:58,973 --> 03:15:01,404
TALIESIN: Don't say "let's see."

2384
03:15:01,404 --> 03:15:04,481
TRAVIS: I'm right under his foot. I'm right
there.

2385
03:15:04,481 --> 03:15:08,312
MATT: Yep. He's going to go ahead and use a
legendary action to attack with his rune blade

2386
03:15:08,312 --> 03:15:09,428
against--

2387
03:15:09,428 --> 03:15:19,004
TALIESIN: I was going to say, you are the heavy
damage dealer so far.

2388
03:15:19,004 --> 03:15:26,972
MATT: You are hitting it a lot. Yeah. It's going
to go against you. Just for this hit. Advantage

2389
03:15:26,972 --> 03:15:29,927
against you? Natural 20.

2390
03:15:29,927 --> 03:15:35,481
LAURA: Oh no! Why? What are you at?

2391
03:15:35,481 --> 03:15:48,167
MARISHA: That's a lot of air math going on.

2392
03:15:48,167 --> 03:15:52,989
MATT: 61 points of slashing damage, halved to 31.

2393
03:15:52,989 --> 03:15:57,701
TRAVIS: Okay. Cool. Can I take my retaliation?

2394
03:15:57,701 --> 03:16:03,356
MATT: It hasn't come back to your turn yet,
because you've already used that last turn.

2395
03:16:03,356 --> 03:16:04,722
TRAVIS: You are right.

2396
03:16:04,722 --> 03:16:11,869
MATT: Wait, have we? Because you went last time to
attack it, yeah, and you took it as it hit you

2397
03:16:11,869 --> 03:16:16,382
back at the end of your turn. Yeah. So that brings
us to Scanlan's turn.

2398
03:16:16,382 --> 03:16:30,546
SAM: I will cast another Lightning Bolt at level six
this time, which is 11d6.

2399
03:16:30,546 --> 03:16:35,885
MATT: It rolled a 17 on its dex save. It has no
dex bonus, so that hits without issue, so full

2400
03:16:35,885 --> 03:16:37,978
damage, so 11d6.

2401
03:16:37,978 --> 03:16:48,539
SAM: Okay. 11d6, yes. Okay. That's only 42.

2402
03:16:48,539 --> 03:16:52,870
MATT: That's pretty decent, though. 42 points of
lightning damage as you blast it from behind.

2403
03:16:52,870 --> 03:16:57,017
(crackling) The energy hits the back and arcs
through its weapon and its blade, and you can see

2404
03:16:57,017 --> 03:17:03,578
steam rising up around where its fingers grasp the
handle. The leather kilt that hangs at its sides

2405
03:17:03,578 --> 03:17:08,931
is singed and burned from the impact. Well done.
Do you want to move or stay where you are?

2406
03:17:08,931 --> 03:17:11,183
SAM: How far am I from the thing?

2407
03:17:11,183 --> 03:17:13,959
MATT: You're about ten, 12 feet from it.

2408
03:17:13,959 --> 03:17:15,868
SAM: I will not move.

2409
03:17:15,868 --> 03:17:17,779
TALIESIN: Oh, but you're not blind anymore.

2410
03:17:17,779 --> 03:17:20,427
SAM: I was never blind.

2411
03:17:20,427 --> 03:17:22,670
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. You avoided it.

2412
03:17:22,670 --> 03:17:28,279
SAM: But me hitting it doesn't un-blind someone
else, does it?

2413
03:17:28,279 --> 03:17:29,329
MATT: Nope.

2414
03:17:29,329 --> 03:17:35,111
SAM: Oh, shit. Okay, I'll Healing Word myself
again, I guess.

2415
03:17:35,111 --> 03:17:36,205
MATT: Okay.

2416
03:17:36,205 --> 03:17:41,090
SAM: What is it? 2d4 plus six.

2417
03:17:41,090 --> 03:17:48,985
MATT: At the end of that turn, it's going to use
its second legendary action to attack Vax this

2418
03:17:48,985 --> 03:17:56,042
time. And since you're blind, it has advantage.
That is a 29 to hit.

2419
03:17:56,042 --> 03:18:03,303
LIAM: Yeah, that hits. This is within the same
round, by the way.

2420
03:18:03,303 --> 03:18:04,541
LAURA: What is your--

2421
03:18:04,541 --> 03:18:05,659
LIAM: Low.

2422
03:18:05,659 --> 03:18:07,037
TALIESIN: That's okay.

2423
03:18:07,037 --> 03:18:08,671
LAURA: You can't die.

2424
03:18:08,671 --> 03:18:10,258
MATT: 29 points of slashing damage.

2425
03:18:10,258 --> 03:18:15,171
LAURA: He can't die? That's a rule?

2426
03:18:15,171 --> 03:18:18,163
TALIESIN: Let's not test that.

2427
03:18:18,163 --> 03:18:28,705
MATT: All right, end of Scanlan's turn. It's the
elemental's turn. The elemental is going to thrash

2428
03:18:28,705 --> 03:18:31,367
whatever's nearby. It's hostile to everything in
the area, and the closest thing to it is the

2429
03:18:31,367 --> 03:18:36,198
creature. So it's going to attack with
disadvantage twice against it. That's a miss and a

2430
03:18:36,198 --> 03:18:40,123
natural one on the second one, yeah. The elemental
swings and is hitting nothing in the air. It's

2431
03:18:40,123 --> 03:18:46,723
angry and thrashing about. At the end of its turn,
it's going to use his last legendary action to

2432
03:18:46,723 --> 03:18:53,347
attack Vax one more time. That's 29 again?

2433
03:18:53,347 --> 03:18:56,439
LIAM: Hits! Don't even bother; I'm unconscious.

2434
03:18:56,439 --> 03:19:04,111
MATT: Okay, so you are, yeah. It would've been 26
points of slashing damage. So with that, you are

2435
03:19:04,111 --> 03:19:05,382
unconscious.

2436
03:19:05,382 --> 03:19:08,581
TRAVIS: Okay. We're good.

2437
03:19:08,666 --> 03:19:13,946
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Grog and
Keyleth's turn.

2438
03:19:13,946 --> 03:19:16,497
TRAVIS: I'll go.

2439
03:19:16,497 --> 03:19:19,083
MARISHA: Go first, see if you hit him.

2440
03:19:19,083 --> 03:19:22,506
TRAVIS: I piñata swing, reckless, great weapon
master.

2441
03:19:22,506 --> 03:19:26,665
MATT: Okay, so the reckless cancels out blindness,
so this is a straight roll.

2442
03:19:26,665 --> 03:19:32,768
TRAVIS: Single. Don't fuck me, Gil. Blacksmith die
for a blacksmith thing. That's not great. That's a

2443
03:19:32,768 --> 03:19:37,345
miss. Yeah. 20 minus five is 15.

2444
03:19:37,345 --> 03:19:39,623
MATT: Yeah. You swing, and it hits air.

2445
03:19:39,623 --> 03:19:46,180
TRAVIS: Well, I have one more. I'll make it
reckless and not great weapon master. Natural 20.

2446
03:19:46,180 --> 03:19:53,482
MATT: Gil fucked and un-fucked you real fast.

2447
03:19:53,482 --> 03:20:02,537
TRAVIS: It's been so long since I've done this, I
don't remember how this works. Okay. So it's three

2448
03:20:02,537 --> 03:20:04,007
times the thing.

2449
03:20:04,007 --> 03:20:08,912
MATT: Yeah. For you, you roll the dice and you do
the critical damage like you normally would.

2450
03:20:08,912 --> 03:20:10,356
LAURA: Yeah! 12!

2451
03:20:10,356 --> 03:20:12,675
MATT: So that's 24, plus your bonuses.

2452
03:20:12,675 --> 03:20:14,027
TRAVIS: Which is 16.

2453
03:20:14,027 --> 03:20:21,946
MATT: And the extra necrotic damage, right? Have
you been forgetting necrotic damage this whole

2454
03:20:21,946 --> 03:20:23,946
time? Grog.

2455
03:20:23,946 --> 03:20:28,291
LIAM: There's a lot of rules and a lot of math.
It's a big book.

2456
03:20:28,291 --> 03:20:32,112
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been forgetting the fucking--

2457
03:20:32,112 --> 03:20:33,833
MATT: Well, now's the time to remember it, buddy.

2458
03:20:33,833 --> 03:20:37,193
LIAM: Travis has a job, another job.

2459
03:20:37,193 --> 03:20:38,659
MATT: It's all good.

2460
03:20:38,659 --> 03:20:41,940
TRAVIS: 1d6 necrotic damage.

2461
03:20:41,940 --> 03:20:44,581
MARISHA: Sam, how many hit points do you have
left?

2462
03:20:44,581 --> 03:20:55,398
SAM: Well, there seems to be some confusion about
that question. I have it at 62, but the overlay

2463
03:20:55,398 --> 03:20:57,499
has me at 44, so I don't know.

2464
03:20:57,499 --> 03:21:01,479
MATT: Plus two additional d12s.

2465
03:21:01,479 --> 03:21:06,956
TRAVIS: A one, 51. And a seven, so 58.

2466
03:21:06,956 --> 03:21:10,780
MATT: 58 points of damage on the hit, and your
blindness goes away.

2467
03:21:10,780 --> 03:21:11,886
LAURA: Yay!

2468
03:21:11,886 --> 03:21:13,149
LIAM: Must be nice.

2469
03:21:13,149 --> 03:21:18,955
LAURA: It's okay. It's all right. I forgot
Hunter's Mark for so many episodes.

2470
03:21:18,955 --> 03:21:22,471
MATT: So this time as you swing out, it cracks
into the side of him and the axe actually wedges a

2471
03:21:22,471 --> 03:21:28,271
few inches into the side of its thigh and rear
region. As it wedges in there, you actually hear

2472
03:21:28,271 --> 03:21:36,255
the first sound emanate from this creature:
(growling). A deep, guttural, vibrating, low

2473
03:21:36,255 --> 03:21:41,027
sound. And as soon as your vision clears up, you
see it turn around, its head under its arm, down

2474
03:21:41,027 --> 03:21:45,172
at you. You're seeing some damage on this thing.

2475
03:21:45,172 --> 03:21:50,219
TRAVIS: I'm like Tony Stark in the Hulkbuster
armor. I'm sorry! Go to sleep!

2476
03:21:50,219 --> 03:21:54,168
MATT: That the end of your turn?

2477
03:21:54,168 --> 03:22:00,078
TRAVIS: Yes, that's the end of my turn.

2478
03:22:00,078 --> 03:22:07,867
MATT: Keyleth, do what you're going to do.

2479
03:22:07,867 --> 03:22:16,850
MARISHA: You're blind as, well? Okay. I see my
boyfriend down, but I think he's all right, he's

2480
03:22:16,850 --> 03:22:30,027
fine. You're fine. God, all my friends are fucking
blind. I turn and I fly over to Vex and I go, snap

2481
03:22:30,027 --> 03:22:40,896
out of it! I slap a healing whatever into her. A
healing touch.

2482
03:22:40,896 --> 03:22:43,079
MATT: All right, so you heal the blindness.

2483
03:22:43,079 --> 03:22:48,871
MARISHA: So 6d8 plus three. Give me a d8 again.

2484
03:22:48,871 --> 03:22:54,554
TALIESIN: Reroll ones?

2485
03:22:54,554 --> 03:23:10,978
MARISHA: Not with healing. (counting) 32.

2486
03:23:10,978 --> 03:23:13,278
MATT: You heal 32, and your blindness dissipates.

2487
03:23:13,278 --> 03:23:17,238
MATT: All right, so you still have movement.

2488
03:23:17,238 --> 03:23:21,477
MARISHA: I'm going to fly back to where I was and
patrol.

2489
03:23:21,477 --> 03:23:25,116
MATT: All right, so you're right there at the edge
of the lava, keeping an eye on the battlefield.

2490
03:23:25,116 --> 03:23:27,540
MARISHA: Yeah, and out of his swinging range.

2491
03:23:27,540 --> 03:23:31,080
MATT: Yes, you're not quite within his range. All
right, that ends your turn. Percival, you're up.

2492
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:45,719
TALIESIN: Taking three shots. And that's a 34 to
hit.

2493
03:23:45,719 --> 03:23:47,288
MATT: That hits.

2494
03:23:47,288 --> 03:23:53,950
TALIESIN: Anything that didn't hit, I'm going to
run Bless. So that's 15 points of damage, five

2495
03:23:53,950 --> 03:24:03,379
points psychic. That's 24.

2496
03:24:03,379 --> 03:24:11,130
MATT: 24 just hits. No, the Bless is
concentration, right? That shit's gone.

2497
03:24:11,130 --> 03:24:13,715
TALIESIN: That misses, and then the other one
misses.

2498
03:24:13,715 --> 03:24:18,300
MATT: Totally forgot to keep rolling concentration
for you on that. That's a thing you've got to keep

2499
03:24:18,300 --> 03:24:19,723
in mind whenever you take damage.

2500
03:24:19,723 --> 03:24:24,100
TALIESIN: Burning an action surge for three more
shots. Burning a grit for advantage.

2501
03:24:24,100 --> 03:24:25,783
MATT: That's right, because you have another
action surge.

2502
03:24:25,783 --> 03:24:42,244
TALIESIN: So advantage number one is a 17 to hit.
26, that hits? Let's put that away; that's not

2503
03:24:42,244 --> 03:24:58,477
helpful anymore. That's 13 points of damage, two
points psychic. Next advantage shot. That's a

2504
03:24:58,477 --> 03:24:59,859
natural 20.

2505
03:24:59,859 --> 03:25:07,772
MARISHA: Thanks, Gil! Gil's on our side!

2506
03:25:07,772 --> 03:25:20,750
TALIESIN: That's seven points of psychic damage.
Oh shit. That's 28 points of piercing damage.

2507
03:25:20,750 --> 03:25:23,603
MATT: Plus nine points psychic?

2508
03:25:23,603 --> 03:25:30,942
TALIESIN: Plus seven points psychic. Half that
damage, next round.

2509
03:25:30,942 --> 03:25:33,138
MATT: Right. The total of that together, then is?

2510
03:25:33,138 --> 03:25:44,626
TALIESIN: Total, (counting) that's 34.

2511
03:25:44,626 --> 03:25:49,489
MATT: So it takes 17 damage next round.

2512
03:25:49,489 --> 03:25:53,595
TALIESIN: Next round, on its turn. I'm burning
another grit for my final shot.

2513
03:25:53,595 --> 03:25:56,827
LAURA: Does grit give you advantage?

2514
03:25:56,827 --> 03:25:59,490
MATT: He can burn a grit to get advantage on a
shot, if he wants to.

2515
03:25:59,490 --> 03:26:02,625
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can do a lot of things with
it, but he's so big, this is my best shot,

2516
03:26:02,625 --> 03:26:10,160
because his AC is so fucking high. That's 31 to
hit.

2517
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:11,290
MATT: That hits.

2518
03:26:11,290 --> 03:26:13,747
MARISHA: Did you have disadvantage on it?

2519
03:26:13,747 --> 03:26:19,403
TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage and one
point of psychic damage.

2520
03:26:19,403 --> 03:26:21,433
MATT: All right, so those are your shots.

2521
03:26:21,433 --> 03:26:24,953
TALIESIN: And I'm running towards that fire pit,
straight back.

2522
03:26:24,953 --> 03:26:28,393
MATT: This way. You're going to have to leap over
lava.

2523
03:26:28,393 --> 03:26:30,216
TALIESIN: I can't whirl around it?

2524
03:26:30,216 --> 03:26:34,723
MATT: If you want to go around it, you can go
(counting).

2525
03:26:34,723 --> 03:26:35,837
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2526
03:26:35,837 --> 03:26:40,303
MATT: All right, there you go. All right, that
ends Percival's turn. Death saving throw, with

2527
03:26:40,303 --> 03:26:42,337
advantage.

2528
03:26:42,337 --> 03:26:43,775
LIAM: Good, natural 20.

2529
03:26:43,775 --> 03:26:49,820
MATT: You're fine. Actually, you stabilize. You're
fine. End of your turn. It's now the forge

2530
03:26:49,820 --> 03:26:50,930
guardian's turn.

2531
03:26:50,930 --> 03:26:52,525
TALIESIN: Is he blind? Is he still blind?

2532
03:26:52,525 --> 03:26:56,528
MATT: Well, he's not conscious, and currently you
are still blind, yeah.

2533
03:26:56,528 --> 03:27:00,429
LIAM: Am I at zero hit points and stable, or one
hit point and stable?

2534
03:27:00,429 --> 03:27:01,668
MATT: Zero hit points and stable.

2535
03:27:01,668 --> 03:27:03,044
LIAM: Love it.

2536
03:27:03,044 --> 03:27:08,651
TRAVIS: One hit point. Zero is unconscious.

2537
03:27:08,651 --> 03:27:11,142
MATT: You don't have to make the death saving
throws anymore.

2538
03:27:11,142 --> 03:27:13,384
LAURA: Oh, but you're still unconscious.

2539
03:27:13,384 --> 03:27:20,813
MATT: No, you regain one hit point if you roll a
20! You're right!

2540
03:27:20,813 --> 03:27:23,652
LIAM: But we're not at the top of the round,
right? We're still mid-round, correct?

2541
03:27:23,652 --> 03:27:27,714
MATT: Correct. So you're conscious now, though
your vision, you open your eyes, and there's still

2542
03:27:27,714 --> 03:27:37,029
darkness, but you're conscious. All right. The
forge guardian does not regain his blade storm.

2543
03:27:37,029 --> 03:27:45,105
He's going to make two melee attacks against you,
Grog, since you've given him the option. Actually,

2544
03:27:45,105 --> 03:27:52,313
he's going to go ahead and leap a little bit, to
land here, not enough to give you an attack of

2545
03:27:52,313 --> 03:27:59,392
opportunity. It's going to make one strike at you,
Grog, and another kick attack at Scanlan.

2546
03:27:59,392 --> 03:28:01,333
LIAM: Kick a gnome?

2547
03:28:01,333 --> 03:28:04,439
TALIESIN: Gnome-kicking is a time-honored
tradition.

2548
03:28:04,439 --> 03:28:08,288
MATT: 31, Grog?

2549
03:28:08,288 --> 03:28:11,524
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits. I'll take the retaliation
after, as well.

2550
03:28:11,524 --> 03:28:35,836
MATT: 34 points of slashing damage. Down to 17.
And Scanlan, that is 28 to hit.

2551
03:28:35,836 --> 03:28:37,532
SAM: That hits.

2552
03:28:37,532 --> 03:28:41,506
MATT: You take 24 points of bludgeoning
damage.

2553
03:28:41,506 --> 03:28:44,756
SAM: I will reduce that with Cutting Words.

2554
03:28:44,756 --> 03:28:46,985
MARISHA: He's about to go down, isn't he?

2555
03:28:46,985 --> 03:28:51,661
MATT: All right, so reduced, so roll a d12. This
is your last bardic inspiration, so you're done

2556
03:28:51,661 --> 03:28:52,906
with this now.

2557
03:28:52,906 --> 03:28:57,356
SAM: d12. Six.

2558
03:28:57,356 --> 03:29:01,524
MATT: Okay. So take six damage off of that.

2559
03:29:01,524 --> 03:29:08,899
SAM: What was the damage? I don't think you said.

2560
03:29:08,899 --> 03:29:10,698
MATT: I thought I did, but I don't remember.

2561
03:29:10,698 --> 03:29:15,767
SAM: You rolled a 20-something to hit, but I don't
think you said damage.

2562
03:29:15,767 --> 03:29:23,274
MATT: That's fine. I can't remember. Okay.
(counting) 25 points, reduced, so you take 19

2563
03:29:23,274 --> 03:29:27,027
points of bludgeoning damage as it kicks you, and
you are pushed 15 feet back.

2564
03:29:27,027 --> 03:29:29,523
LIAM and MARISHA: Past the lava!

2565
03:29:29,523 --> 03:29:34,964
TRAVIS: Skipping across!

2566
03:29:34,964 --> 03:29:39,161
MARISHA: Please tell me you're not unconscious.

2567
03:29:39,161 --> 03:30:03,329
MATT: So Scanlan, you immediately are kicked back
into the molten rock and iron. That is 61 points

2568
03:30:03,329 --> 03:30:05,933
of fire damage.

2569
03:30:05,933 --> 03:30:08,672
LAURA: Did he go under? Tell me you're not
unconscious.

2570
03:30:08,672 --> 03:30:11,287
SAM: I'm unconscious.

2571
03:30:11,287 --> 03:30:19,480
MATT: Scanlan is now on fire, and (sizzling) he's
T-800-ing.

2572
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:21,437
TRAVIS: Can I take my retaliation attack?

2573
03:30:21,437 --> 03:30:22,641
MATT: You can.

2574
03:30:22,641 --> 03:30:23,974
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon master.

2575
03:30:23,974 --> 03:30:30,697
LAURA: I think I can get him out.

2576
03:30:30,697 --> 03:30:32,922
TRAVIS: 34 minus five. 29.

2577
03:30:32,922 --> 03:30:34,442
MATT: That hits. Roll damage on that.

2578
03:30:34,442 --> 03:30:39,022
TRAVIS: 23, 33.

2579
03:30:39,022 --> 03:30:47,532
MATT: 33 damage. By the way, at the top of its
turn, it also took 17 points of damage from your

2580
03:30:47,532 --> 03:30:57,509
hemorrhaging shot. It's looking rough now. It's
looking pretty rough. All right, so that finishes

2581
03:30:57,509 --> 03:31:00,222
that turn. End of his turn, Vex, you're up.

2582
03:31:00,222 --> 03:31:06,481
LAURA: Yeah. Okay. All right, can I get to Scanlan
from my position on the map?

2583
03:31:06,481 --> 03:31:09,640
LIAM: Movement, dash, action to grab him.

2584
03:31:09,640 --> 03:31:14,042
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to pick him up.

2585
03:31:14,042 --> 03:31:18,331
MATT: All right, so you glide down and you grab
his body, and you lift him up, and you get him out

2586
03:31:18,331 --> 03:31:20,687
of the lava but that's as much movement as you've
got.

2587
03:31:20,687 --> 03:31:22,567
LAURA: Can I use my action to--

2588
03:31:22,567 --> 03:31:24,469
MATT: It's your action to grab and pull him out.

2589
03:31:24,469 --> 03:31:28,611
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action to dash away?

2590
03:31:28,611 --> 03:31:31,090
MATT: You can. I'll say you move half speed
because you're having to bring him with you.

2591
03:31:31,090 --> 03:31:32,641
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to back up.

2592
03:31:32,641 --> 03:31:35,490
MATT: So you can get both of you guys back up to
wherever you want to go.

2593
03:31:35,490 --> 03:31:36,615
LAURA: Into the corner.

2594
03:31:36,615 --> 03:31:42,975
MATT: Into the corner? So you get about there.

2595
03:31:42,975 --> 03:31:45,279
LAURA: At least I got him out of the lava.

2596
03:31:45,279 --> 03:31:48,471
LIAM: I have had a jackrabbit knee under the table
for ten minutes.

2597
03:31:48,471 --> 03:31:50,905
LAURA: But that's it? That's everything.

2598
03:31:50,905 --> 03:31:58,338
MATT: All right, so that ends Vex's turn. Top of
the round, Scanlan, you immediately take fire

2599
03:31:58,338 --> 03:32:02,938
damage because you're still on fire, so you
immediately fail a death saving throw.

2600
03:32:02,938 --> 03:32:05,377
SAM: But I have some sort of Death Ward on me.

2601
03:32:05,377 --> 03:32:13,797
MATT: You do have Death Ward on you! So as you go
and reach and grab him and pull him up, the Death

2602
03:32:13,797 --> 03:32:19,046
Ward flickers on and he comes back to one hit
point. You pull him off to the side. As soon as

2603
03:32:19,046 --> 03:32:23,034
his turn comes up, he takes seven points of fire
damage and <i>now</i> goes to zero.

2604
03:32:23,034 --> 03:32:26,124
MARISHA: He didn't fail a death saving throw.

2605
03:32:26,124 --> 03:32:28,390
MATT: The Death Ward has expired.

2606
03:32:28,390 --> 03:32:31,655
LIAM: Point of clarification. We're at the top of
the round, so I just went from one hit point to two hit points.

2607
03:32:31,655 --> 03:32:43,701
MATT: Yeah, I think so, actually. Well, it's the
top of your turn, so yeah. Let me double check on that.

2608
03:32:43,701 --> 03:32:45,506
LIAM: Safe at two. No one can touch me.

2609
03:32:45,506 --> 03:32:46,800
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're all good.

2610
03:32:46,800 --> 03:32:59,414
MATT: All righty, so that brings us from Scanlan's
turn to the elemental's turn. The elemental is

2611
03:32:59,414 --> 03:33:01,853
going to go ahead and (whoosh).

2612
03:33:01,853 --> 03:33:03,871
SAM: This overlay thing's pretty cool.

2613
03:33:03,871 --> 03:33:09,938
LIAM: Yeah, right? It makes remote play not quite
as removed.

2614
03:33:09,938 --> 03:33:14,423
SAM: Can we have a hologram version of that in
front of us all the time?

2615
03:33:14,423 --> 03:33:15,624
TRAVIS: Yeah, right here.

2616
03:33:15,624 --> 03:33:17,600
MARISHA: Yeah, counting our hit points for us?

2617
03:33:17,600 --> 03:33:18,954
SAM: That we can see, I mean.

2618
03:33:18,954 --> 03:33:26,524
MATT: That is 13 against your armor class. Does
not hit. And 14 does not hit. It has the blindness

2619
03:33:26,524 --> 03:33:28,327
on the elemental, still.

2620
03:33:28,327 --> 03:33:30,886
TRAVIS: Super cute elemental, chasing me like a
puppy.

2621
03:33:30,886 --> 03:33:36,016
MATT: Ending that elemental's turn. It
is now Grog and Keyleth's turn.

2622
03:33:36,016 --> 03:33:45,288
TRAVIS: I'll go. Turn straight at him, reckless,
great weapon master.

2623
03:33:45,288 --> 03:33:46,807
MATT: All righty.

2624
03:33:46,807 --> 03:33:50,679
TRAVIS: That's going to be enough. Come on, crit.
No. Okay.

2625
03:33:50,679 --> 03:33:55,589
MATT: Technically, sorry, before we get to that,
at the end of its turn, at the end of the

2626
03:33:55,589 --> 03:33:59,981
elemental's turn, it's going to go ahead and
strike you with its blade.

2627
03:33:59,981 --> 03:34:03,254
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to keep that roll just in
case something happens.

2628
03:34:03,254 --> 03:34:07,195
MATT: No worries. That's a 27 to hit.

2629
03:34:07,195 --> 03:34:08,500
TRAVIS: Which it does.

2630
03:34:08,500 --> 03:34:24,508
MATT: 36 points of slashing damage, reduced to
half, so that's 18. And make a constitution saving

2631
03:34:24,508 --> 03:34:26,182
throw, please.

2632
03:34:26,182 --> 03:34:35,702
MARISHA: I have four as my planetar, so I've got
two more of those that I just did, in terms of

2633
03:34:35,702 --> 03:34:39,249
myself. I'm trying to keep tabs.

2634
03:34:39,249 --> 03:34:40,497
TRAVIS: 24.

2635
03:34:40,497 --> 03:34:46,156
MATT: 24? Yeah, you resist the blindness. So your
turn, unabated as you were before.

2636
03:34:46,156 --> 03:34:48,762
TRAVIS: Right. Minus five, is 31 to hit.

2637
03:34:48,762 --> 03:34:49,858
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2638
03:34:49,858 --> 03:35:00,840
TRAVIS: It was a great roll. And the second one is
pretty big. 34 minus five is 29.

2639
03:35:00,840 --> 03:35:02,903
MATT: That hits, yeah. Both do damage.

2640
03:35:02,903 --> 03:35:06,105
LIAM: Let me do a little roleplay here. Oh, baby!

2641
03:35:06,105 --> 03:35:13,850
TRAVIS: 17 plus ten is 27 for the first one. Oh,
nope. I'm sorry! That was a one, so I'm going to

2642
03:35:13,850 --> 03:35:31,242
re-roll it. Five, 21, 31 for the first one. Second
one. Three, 29, and my fucking necrotic dice. Two,

2643
03:35:31,242 --> 03:35:32,508
four more.

2644
03:35:32,508 --> 03:35:37,390
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?

2645
03:35:37,390 --> 03:35:45,446
TRAVIS: That does. Actually, can I move? I'm going
to stay in melee, but I want to come over here in

2646
03:35:45,446 --> 03:35:49,240
case he decides to golf-swing me into the fucking
lava river.

2647
03:35:49,240 --> 03:35:52,760
MATT: Sure. It's going to use its second legendary
action to attack you, as soon as you move around,

2648
03:35:52,760 --> 03:35:56,578
it's going to sweep low and attempt to try and
cleave you in half. With the advantage against

2649
03:35:56,578 --> 03:35:59,452
you, natural 20.

2650
03:35:59,452 --> 03:36:01,568
(screaming)

2651
03:36:01,568 --> 03:36:02,701
TALIESIN: Knock it off!

2652
03:36:02,701 --> 03:36:05,051
MATT: That reckless attack, man. He gets advantage
on all his attacks against him.

2653
03:36:05,051 --> 03:36:08,821
TRAVIS: That's the reason I roll so high most of
the time.

2654
03:36:08,821 --> 03:36:12,929
MARISHA: Yeah, you kill them before they can
retaliate.

2655
03:36:12,929 --> 03:36:21,626
MATT: 73 points of slashing damage. On 3d12, it
was a ten, eight, and a 12.

2656
03:36:21,626 --> 03:36:23,163
MARISHA: What was it, 76?

2657
03:36:23,163 --> 03:36:25,967
TRAVIS: So that's 37?

2658
03:36:25,967 --> 03:36:37,653
MATT: It's 20, 30, times two, 60, plus 13. So 73.
So half of that would be 36, we'll say. 36 points

2659
03:36:37,653 --> 03:36:39,569
of slashing damage, and make a constitution saving
throw.

2660
03:36:39,569 --> 03:36:41,532
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

2661
03:36:41,532 --> 03:36:47,026
TRAVIS: Yeah, 24.

2662
03:36:47,026 --> 03:36:50,086
MATT: 24, okay. Resisting it still.

2663
03:36:50,086 --> 03:36:53,238
TRAVIS: I can still see?

2664
03:36:53,238 --> 03:36:56,110
MATT: Yeah, you can still see. All right,
Keyleth.

2665
03:36:56,110 --> 03:37:01,241
MARISHA: Okay. You can still see? Everyone's good?
You're up? Everyone's up?

2666
03:37:01,241 --> 03:37:04,317
LAURA: Scanlan's dead. Unconscious.

2667
03:37:04,317 --> 03:37:16,925
MARISHA: You're with him. He's fine. I'm going to
fly over. 120 feet. I've got a five-foot reach

2668
03:37:16,925 --> 03:37:27,902
range. I'm going to do my multiattack as my
planetar. So two hits, with plus two. I'm going to

2669
03:37:27,902 --> 03:37:29,064
do Gil.

2670
03:37:29,064 --> 03:37:31,250
LIAM: Come on, Captain Planet!

2671
03:37:31,250 --> 03:37:33,537
TRAVIS: We just had three fights in the same day.

2672
03:37:33,537 --> 03:37:40,751
MARISHA: Goddamn. That's a natural 19 on one, and
a natural 16 on the other! Plus 12 for both of those.

2673
03:37:40,751 --> 03:37:43,480
MATT: Yeah, those both hit.

2674
03:37:43,480 --> 03:37:51,698
MARISHA: Okay, and then for both of those, 4d6
plus seven, and an additional 5d8 radiant damage.

2675
03:37:51,698 --> 03:37:52,902
MATT: Correct.

2676
03:37:52,902 --> 03:37:54,059
LIAM: Kiki, it's yours.

2677
03:37:54,059 --> 03:37:55,996
LAURA: Kill it!

2678
03:37:55,996 --> 03:38:05,902
MARISHA: Okay, for the d6s alone. Okay, that's six
plus four, that's ten plus another five, 15, plus

2679
03:38:05,902 --> 03:38:07,060
three is 18.

2680
03:38:07,060 --> 03:38:10,116
MATT: 18 plus seven. 25?

2681
03:38:10,116 --> 03:38:16,164
MARISHA: I'm just doing the d6s. 25, and then, not
as great the second time.

2682
03:38:16,164 --> 03:38:17,375
TALIESIN: Do you re-roll those?

2683
03:38:17,375 --> 03:38:24,947
MARISHA: No, not for this. Only elemental
damage. So five, six, seven, plus another seven,

2684
03:38:24,947 --> 03:38:25,946
so 14.

2685
03:38:25,946 --> 03:38:29,209
MATT: 14, okay, and then now 10d8 radiant damage.

2686
03:38:29,209 --> 03:38:37,588
MARISHA: Now 10d8 radiant damage. I may just roll
these twice, okay, so the first one. Okay, ten

2687
03:38:37,588 --> 03:38:59,541
plus seven, so 17, plus another seven is 24
radiant, and then (counting) 19 damage. Radiant

2688
03:38:59,541 --> 03:39:00,578
damage.

2689
03:39:00,578 --> 03:39:01,746
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2690
03:39:01,746 --> 03:39:04,810
(shouting)

2691
03:39:04,810 --> 03:39:11,530
MATT: As you rush across the room, rushing towards
it, and strike out towards it, what do you want to do?

2692
03:39:11,530 --> 03:39:20,875
MARISHA: Okay. (grunts) As I look around, see all
my friends, blind and running around insane, I'm

2693
03:39:20,875 --> 03:39:29,342
going to go (yells) and fly across the field, and
come down with a big radiant strike, and try and

2694
03:39:29,342 --> 03:39:37,544
invoke in the back of my head, (singing)
Hallelujah! And (grunts).

2695
03:39:37,544 --> 03:39:42,603
MATT: As you arc down with your weapon, the holy,
divine energy spraying off of the strike, the

2696
03:39:42,603 --> 03:39:48,579
arc slams into the center of the guardian's chest,
and you watch as the armor expands and explodes.

2697
03:39:48,579 --> 03:39:54,677
You see this core in the center that previously
has been guarded by its stone form, and there on

2698
03:39:54,677 --> 03:40:07,907
the inside you see this beating red gem that
(power-down sound) goes cold. As it does, the

2699
03:40:07,907 --> 03:40:17,227
guardian drops the blade (footsteps) and walks to
the other side of the chamber, pieces of its armor

2700
03:40:17,227 --> 03:40:23,962
falling off to the ground. You see cracked parts
of its outer form breaking off in small chunks of

2701
03:40:23,962 --> 03:40:33,339
shale, and it makes its way to the opposite side,
walking around, carefully, each of you. It takes

2702
03:40:33,339 --> 03:40:44,615
and places its blade (crashing) up on this stand
on the wall, turns around, and goes completely

2703
03:40:44,615 --> 03:40:45,803
inert.

2704
03:40:45,803 --> 03:40:52,550
LAURA: Whoa. It was a trial. You had to be able to
beat him in order to forge here. I'm putting

2705
03:40:52,550 --> 03:40:56,144
Scanlan out! Because he's still on fire.

2706
03:40:56,144 --> 03:40:57,402
MATT: Okay. Scanlan is still on fire.

2707
03:40:57,402 --> 03:40:58,877
LAURA: Scanlan is not on fire anymore.

2708
03:40:58,877 --> 03:41:00,043
TRAVIS: Is he unconscious still?

2709
03:41:00,043 --> 03:41:07,355
LAURA: He's still unconscious, so I'm going to
cast Cure Wounds at level one, because that's what I

2710
03:41:07,355 --> 03:41:10,365
can do, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him to
bring him back to life.

2711
03:41:10,365 --> 03:41:18,038
MARISHA: Okay, and then I fly over, (whoosh), and
do my other healing touch on Vax.

2712
03:41:18,038 --> 03:41:19,591
MATT: How many healing touches does he have?

2713
03:41:19,591 --> 03:41:20,624
MARISHA: Four.

2714
03:41:20,624 --> 03:41:24,364
LIAM: Wait. I don't need it. Wait.

2715
03:41:24,364 --> 03:41:28,055
LAURA: So six points, Scanlan, that's what you've
got.

2716
03:41:28,055 --> 03:41:45,270
LIAM: The massive gash across my entire body, as
you stand there for 30 seconds, starts to close.

2717
03:41:45,270 --> 03:41:59,737
MARISHA: Cool. (whoosh) I go over to Scanlan and
do a healing touch. 6d8. (counting) Can you give

2718
03:41:59,737 --> 03:42:14,660
me one more d8? Okay. Scanlan, you have 14, 15,
26. You heal 26 plus three, so 29 hit points.

2719
03:42:14,660 --> 03:42:17,123
SAM: Thank you.

2720
03:42:17,123 --> 03:42:21,622
MARISHA: And you're cured from any diseases. Is
anyone else blind or rough?

2721
03:42:21,622 --> 03:42:24,270
LIAM: That's gone as soon as he's done fighting.

2722
03:42:24,270 --> 03:42:25,902
MATT: Yes, the blindness has faded.

2723
03:42:25,902 --> 03:42:28,160
MARISHA: I have one more of these if anyone else
needs healing.

2724
03:42:28,160 --> 03:42:31,838
TRAVIS: I'm in double digits, which is
uncomfortable for me.

2725
03:42:31,838 --> 03:42:34,660
LAURA: Yeah, you're low double digits, too!

2726
03:42:34,660 --> 03:42:37,425
MARISHA: You're low double digits? (whoosh)

2727
03:42:37,425 --> 03:42:38,665
MATT: Where are you at?

2728
03:42:38,665 --> 03:42:39,866
TRAVIS: 53.

2729
03:42:39,866 --> 03:42:43,908
MARISHA: I drop same thing into Grog.

2730
03:42:43,908 --> 03:42:54,648
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got my ass handed to me. Two crits
by that giant bastard.

2731
03:42:54,648 --> 03:42:57,088
MATT: That reckless, man. That's the downside.

2732
03:42:57,088 --> 03:42:59,523
TRAVIS: I know. I'll take, though. It's worth the
gamble.

2733
03:42:59,523 --> 03:43:12,522
MARISHA: (counting) You get 37 hit points.

2734
03:43:12,522 --> 03:43:16,963
MATT: The first part of this fight, he was
sucking. It was like, two, three, three, two, and

2735
03:43:16,963 --> 03:43:31,152
then he picked up. All righty. So in the silence,
as you guys take a moment to breathe and recover,

2736
03:43:31,152 --> 03:43:39,184
the uncomfortable heat in here is sweltering. The
guardian is motionless across the forge. The blade

2737
03:43:39,184 --> 03:43:43,211
is set up against the wall, now obscured by the
smoke that's still billowing up across the back

2738
03:43:43,211 --> 03:43:49,237
wall. Getting a better glance around, you can see
a lot of the soot and black that has gathered in

2739
03:43:49,237 --> 03:43:56,318
the upper areas of the ceiling, which is about 50
feet high. There you see, faintly glowing and

2740
03:43:56,318 --> 03:44:04,340
obscuring the air above it, the Core Anvil, the
chains still held taut as the various

2741
03:44:04,340 --> 03:44:08,359
blacksmithing implements hang dangling off the
sides of the central platform.

2742
03:44:08,359 --> 03:44:13,546
TRAVIS: Well, that was a bitch. What do you say we
cut to the chase and hammer this shit out?

2743
03:44:13,546 --> 03:44:16,627
LAURA: I hope he won't come back to life as soon
as we start.

2744
03:44:16,627 --> 03:44:19,829
MARISHA: Is my elemental still going rogue?

2745
03:44:19,829 --> 03:44:22,425
MATT: I will say at this point, because the
elemental took quite a bit of damage, that you

2746
03:44:22,425 --> 03:44:26,173
guys quickly dispatch it. I don't want to have to
worry about you guys killing a blind elemental.

2747
03:44:26,173 --> 03:44:30,344
It's fine. No longer blind, but still. (splat)
It's gone.

2748
03:44:30,344 --> 03:44:35,386
MARISHA: Keyleth goes Mickey in Fantasia for a
second, and she's the axe to the brooms, killing

2749
03:44:35,386 --> 03:44:39,039
my creation.

2750
03:44:39,039 --> 03:44:45,233
TRAVIS: There's a big splash up against the wall,
but it's just water.

2751
03:44:45,233 --> 03:44:51,486
TALIESIN: Sam, your inspiration is a long rest
recharge, not a short rest, right?

2752
03:44:51,486 --> 03:44:52,459
MATT: Short rest.

2753
03:44:52,459 --> 03:44:55,388
TALIESIN: Oh! If we take a short rest, he can
inspire us when we do this.

2754
03:44:55,388 --> 03:44:58,656
LAURA: Yeah, we should probably, if we can, take a
short rest.

2755
03:44:58,656 --> 03:45:02,440
LIAM: That's a half hour? Yeah, that was hard.

2756
03:45:02,440 --> 03:45:03,815
TALIESIN: I want to sit down.

2757
03:45:03,815 --> 03:45:07,772
LAURA: Just so you guys can think about your
process, know exactly what you're doing.

2758
03:45:07,772 --> 03:45:09,217
TALIESIN: We do need to discuss this.

2759
03:45:09,217 --> 03:45:18,424
MATT: While you guys are taking a short rest, you
can heal up with your hit dice. I also need

2760
03:45:18,424 --> 03:45:22,488
everyone to make a constitution saving throw,
please, because it's so hot in here.

2761
03:45:22,488 --> 03:45:24,600
LIAM: Do I, with the fire on the Deathwalker's
Ward?

2762
03:45:24,600 --> 03:45:26,955
MARISHA: Yeah. And me with the mantle?

2763
03:45:26,955 --> 03:45:32,622
MATT: This is a little more than the usual mantle.
I'll say you have to make it, as well, Vax, just

2764
03:45:32,622 --> 03:45:34,040
make it with advantage.

2765
03:45:34,040 --> 03:45:37,519
MARISHA: Do I get with advantage because of the
mantle or no?

2766
03:45:37,519 --> 03:45:39,490
TALIESIN: 18.

2767
03:45:39,490 --> 03:45:40,511
TRAVIS: 21.

2768
03:45:40,511 --> 03:45:42,027
LAURA: 19.

2769
03:45:42,027 --> 03:45:42,871
LIAM: 25.

2770
03:45:42,871 --> 03:45:43,799
MARISHA: 14.

2771
03:45:43,799 --> 03:45:45,044
LAURA: Scanlan?

2772
03:45:45,044 --> 03:45:47,193
SAM: I rolled that poop thing again.

2773
03:45:47,193 --> 03:45:51,757
MATT: So both Scanlan and Keyleth gain a point of
exhaustion.

2774
03:45:51,757 --> 03:45:56,724
SAM: Wait, do I get advantage? No, I don't know.

2775
03:45:56,724 --> 03:45:57,962
MATT: You do not.

2776
03:45:57,962 --> 03:46:03,388
LAURA: You got a lot of hit dice that you can
roll.

2777
03:46:03,388 --> 03:46:09,750
TRAVIS: I do, but still. Four.

2778
03:46:09,750 --> 03:46:12,275
MATT: Your constitution modifier is?

2779
03:46:12,275 --> 03:46:14,008
TRAVIS: Five.

2780
03:46:14,008 --> 03:46:19,843
TALIESIN: And now I'm up to top again, and it only
took two hit dice. And then I get my heal back. I

2781
03:46:19,843 --> 03:46:25,014
get my action surges back. Grit comes back on a
short rest.

2782
03:46:25,014 --> 03:46:26,928
LAURA: I'm back to 144.

2783
03:46:26,928 --> 03:46:32,502
LIAM: Back at the temporary 137, due to the
feast.

2784
03:46:32,502 --> 03:46:43,502
TALIESIN: I'm going to really quickly fix Bad
News. All right, I fixed Bad News.

2785
03:46:43,502 --> 03:46:45,003
MATT: There you go.

2786
03:46:45,003 --> 03:46:54,901
TALIESIN: Wow. And so many things don't work
anymore. Okay. Yeah.

2787
03:46:54,901 --> 03:46:57,924
MATT: What's wrong now?

2788
03:46:57,924 --> 03:47:06,038
TALIESIN: Oh, my Hex is burned, my Spider Climb's
burned, Diplomacy is a long rest before that goes

2789
03:47:06,038 --> 03:47:06,910
again.

2790
03:47:06,910 --> 03:47:11,129
MATT: So you guys finish your short rest. What do
you want to do in the chamber? You have the whole

2791
03:47:11,129 --> 03:47:12,283
chamber at your disposal.

2792
03:47:12,283 --> 03:47:17,150
TRAVIS: I would like to go to the top where the
Core Anvil is and start pulling up each of the

2793
03:47:17,150 --> 03:47:19,299
tools that are hanging by the four chains.

2794
03:47:19,299 --> 03:47:26,446
MATT: Okay. You find numerous sets of tongs. You
find twisting tools. You find metal punches. You

2795
03:47:26,446 --> 03:47:33,063
find chisels of all sizes. You see a form of leg
vise that's laying at the side of the anvil which

2796
03:47:33,063 --> 03:47:40,784
you know immediately, weirdly for you, a leg vise
is a small device that you use to clamp metal onto

2797
03:47:40,784 --> 03:47:51,352
the anvil to work on it. You use your foot to hold
down with pressure. You also see the hammer that

2798
03:47:51,352 --> 03:48:01,486
was chained to it, as well, which is very well
made. The dark black hammer metal look with gold

2799
03:48:01,486 --> 03:48:10,016
inlay. It looks like scrolling all across it in
places. All these different tools are all chained

2800
03:48:10,016 --> 03:48:12,635
to the actual sides of the anvil.

2801
03:48:12,635 --> 03:48:18,481
TRAVIS: Can I tell what material the black part of
the hammer is made out of? If it's rock, metal,

2802
03:48:18,481 --> 03:48:20,314
some sort of volcanic glass?

2803
03:48:20,314 --> 03:48:22,012
MATT: It appears to be metal.

2804
03:48:22,012 --> 03:48:27,285
LAURA: So these trammels need to be made out of
platinum. You know how to do it, right?

2805
03:48:27,285 --> 03:48:29,541
TALIESIN: No, I know how to do it.

2806
03:48:29,541 --> 03:48:32,307
LAURA: Okay. So what do we do?

2807
03:48:32,307 --> 03:48:39,371
TRAVIS: I have the chunks of platinum. I hand the
chunks of platinum over to Percy to put the-- I

2808
03:48:39,371 --> 03:48:40,898
guess they don't have to be in--

2809
03:48:40,898 --> 03:48:42,682
TALIESIN: We're going to have to smelt them.

2810
03:48:42,682 --> 03:48:45,858
LAURA: They're going to be melted.

2811
03:48:45,858 --> 03:48:47,528
TRAVIS: So we should do that, right?

2812
03:48:47,528 --> 03:48:51,305
TALIESIN: We're going to have to start with
smelting them. Well, I don't know. You know the

2813
03:48:51,305 --> 03:48:58,418
process, I don't. Why am I in character talking to
the dungeon master? What's happening? Ah, the

2814
03:48:58,418 --> 03:48:59,257
meta.

2815
03:48:59,257 --> 03:49:06,591
MATT: You understand, based on the discussion you
guys had between the design, the platinum has to

2816
03:49:06,591 --> 03:49:12,138
be smelted down into workable bars, ingots of
metal that can be hammered and folded. You have to

2817
03:49:12,138 --> 03:49:16,992
get into the chamber to do so because the smelting
materials are in the chamber you just came from.

2818
03:49:16,992 --> 03:49:29,077
This is the forging chamber. The other doors are
still closed. Once they're made into bars, and

2819
03:49:29,077 --> 03:49:33,798
this is from the design that you recall Ioun gave
you, the beads of divinity that you've been given,

2820
03:49:33,798 --> 03:49:41,619
you have to actually shatter across the anvil and
then fold the pieces into the metal.

2821
03:49:41,619 --> 03:49:45,566
TRAVIS: Cool.

2822
03:49:45,566 --> 03:49:53,021
MATT: Once that's done then you actually have a
solid blank of platinum inlaid with the fragments

2823
03:49:53,021 --> 03:50:02,686
of divinity. You then have to draw out the trammel
tips, which makes them into a fine point like a

2824
03:50:02,686 --> 03:50:09,813
long javelin-like rod. Then you have to use the
vise, after heating the metal, to twist the

2825
03:50:09,813 --> 03:50:14,502
trammels. The actual design has them twisted
because it helps conduct the divine energy to the

2826
03:50:14,502 --> 03:50:22,036
point. And then using the chiseling tools, you
have to work in the runes that match and channel

2827
03:50:22,036 --> 03:50:27,516
the incantation that Scanlan's book has. It's a
multi-process step that's going to require both of

2828
03:50:27,516 --> 03:50:30,944
you to work together on this, since some elements
of it are blacksmithing elements, some of it are

2829
03:50:30,944 --> 03:50:31,737
tinkering.

2830
03:50:31,737 --> 03:50:36,313
LAURA: So we have to get into the other room first
before we do any of that. Can I fly over and see

2831
03:50:36,313 --> 03:50:38,424
if I can find any kind of apparatus that would--

2832
03:50:38,424 --> 03:50:40,174
MATT: Make a perception check.

2833
03:50:40,174 --> 03:50:46,882
LIAM: Going with her to do the same.
Investigation?

2834
03:50:46,882 --> 03:50:48,176
LAURA: 30.

2835
03:50:48,176 --> 03:50:53,513
MATT: So 30. You glance up and you see it looks
there like there were two chains that were

2836
03:50:53,513 --> 03:51:03,374
originally down held on a crank device. However,
the chain has been cut and the other half of it is

2837
03:51:03,374 --> 03:51:05,002
about 20 feet up in the air.

2838
03:51:05,002 --> 03:51:15,003
LAURA: Okay. And I'm assuming that I'm not strong
enough to pull on that chain, right? I can try.

2839
03:51:15,003 --> 03:51:16,459
I'm going to try.

2840
03:51:16,459 --> 03:51:19,117
LIAM: Why don't you and I try?

2841
03:51:19,117 --> 03:51:21,018
LAURA: Yeah, but you can't fly anymore.

2842
03:51:21,018 --> 03:51:22,695
MARISHA: I can, though. I still have wings.

2843
03:51:22,695 --> 03:51:24,592
LAURA: You fly on one and I'll try to get the
other one.

2844
03:51:24,592 --> 03:51:25,655
MARISHA: Yeah.

2845
03:51:25,655 --> 03:51:32,396
MATT: So planetar form. Go ahead and make a
strength check, please.

2846
03:51:32,396 --> 03:51:46,609
MARISHA: I am looking right now. My strength is
24, so plus seven. (scoffs) Again. Why again with

2847
03:51:46,609 --> 03:51:47,529
the threes?

2848
03:51:47,529 --> 03:51:49,887
TALIESIN: Put that one away.

2849
03:51:49,929 --> 03:51:51,808
MARISHA: Ten.

2850
03:51:51,808 --> 03:51:54,562
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a 13.

2851
03:51:54,562 --> 03:51:57,928
MATT: You two tug on those chains, and they are
not moving.

2852
03:51:57,928 --> 03:52:08,422
LAURA: Can the guardian do it? Hey, you that was
attacking us. Can you get those chains?

2853
03:52:08,422 --> 03:52:10,539
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2854
03:52:10,539 --> 03:52:20,990
LAURA: (laughs) Really? Yeah, it wasn't a very
persuasive thing to say. 14.

2855
03:52:20,990 --> 03:52:27,037
MATT: 14? It makes no motion, change, nothing.

2856
03:52:27,037 --> 03:52:31,222
LIAM: Shorthalt, you got any Bigby's left in you?

2857
03:52:31,222 --> 03:52:35,500
SAM: I could do one if we really need it. What's
wrong with Grog? He can't do it?

2858
03:52:35,500 --> 03:52:36,798
LAURA: It's too high.

2859
03:52:36,798 --> 03:52:38,483
LIAM: He could do one. We could get him up there.

2860
03:52:38,483 --> 03:52:43,981
MARISHA: Is the end of the chain able to where I
can pull to at least make it reach Grog or no?

2861
03:52:43,981 --> 03:52:47,356
MATT: No, you don't have the strength to pull it
down, not with that strength check, unfortunately.

2862
03:52:47,356 --> 03:52:55,687
LIAM: Can you Bigby one and maybe Vex can slowly
pull Grog up to that thing on your broom?

2863
03:52:55,687 --> 03:52:57,622
LAURA: Or she could probably lift Grog up.

2864
03:52:57,622 --> 03:52:59,212
MARISHA: Can I fly Grog up?

2865
03:52:59,212 --> 03:53:07,178
MATT: Yeah. You can lift him up. (grunts) It takes
you a minute and it's a slow pull. You feel the

2866
03:53:07,178 --> 03:53:10,800
veins bulging on your blue-skinned forehead.
(grunts)

2867
03:53:10,800 --> 03:53:13,388
TRAVIS: Kicking my feet, which doesn't make it any
easier.

2868
03:53:13,388 --> 03:53:14,923
MARISHA: Dog-paddling.

2869
03:53:14,923 --> 03:53:20,297
MATT: But you do get up, Grog, and you grab the
chain. Make a strength check.

2870
03:53:20,297 --> 03:53:23,872
TRAVIS: I'm not still raging, unfortunately.

2871
03:53:23,872 --> 03:53:26,627
MATT: You can still be raging if you want to.

2872
03:53:26,627 --> 03:53:29,956
LAURA: You're very angry about it.

2873
03:53:29,956 --> 03:53:32,864
TRAVIS: 23.

2874
03:53:32,864 --> 03:53:39,070
MATT: As you lift him up, you grab the chain and
rappelling down, you begin to find places in the

2875
03:53:39,070 --> 03:53:44,419
stonework and metal on the side and hold on with
your other hand, pull. As you do, you watch the

2876
03:53:44,419 --> 03:53:49,539
wall on the opposite side (scraping) move up on one
side a little bit and get stuck.

2877
03:53:49,539 --> 03:53:50,939
SAM: Should I Bigby the other?

2878
03:53:50,939 --> 03:53:51,933
LAURA: Yeah.

2879
03:53:51,933 --> 03:53:54,385
SAM: All right. I'll have to do it at level seven.

2880
03:53:54,385 --> 03:53:57,344
MARISHA: Oh shit. We're so tapped out.

2881
03:53:57,344 --> 03:54:02,358
MATT: So Bigby's Hand appears, (whoosh) rushes up
to the other chain. Go ahead and make a d20 roll

2882
03:54:02,358 --> 03:54:05,744
and add an eight to it.

2883
03:54:05,744 --> 03:54:09,948
SAM: 21.

2884
03:54:09,948 --> 03:54:16,409
MATT: As Bigby pulls the other side, the wall on
the opposite side adjusts and both chains now,

2885
03:54:16,409 --> 03:54:22,706
Grog and Bigby's Hand together, pull and pull and
pull and slowly, as you're both pulling across the

2886
03:54:22,706 --> 03:54:28,362
metal and dragging it downward, the opposite wall
(scraping). Opens up.

2887
03:54:28,362 --> 03:54:31,694
SAM: Oh wait. Is this an ability check?

2888
03:54:31,694 --> 03:54:33,083
MATT: Yeah.

2889
03:54:33,083 --> 03:54:34,997
SAM: I'm exhausted.

2890
03:54:34,997 --> 03:54:36,438
TALIESIN: Bigby isn't, though.

2891
03:54:36,438 --> 03:54:47,129
MATT: Bigby isn't. It's a check for the spell, not
for you. So together you both eventually bring the

2892
03:54:47,129 --> 03:54:52,992
chains to the bottom and you find one of the
number of hooks on the floor area where you can

2893
03:54:52,992 --> 03:54:57,820
wrap it around to hold it in place. It's tenuous
but it's holding. And so the large metal door on

2894
03:54:57,820 --> 03:55:04,693
the opposite side is currently now held up about 13
feet up. It's only partway up right now but that's

2895
03:55:04,693 --> 03:55:06,241
all you need at the moment.

2896
03:55:06,241 --> 03:55:09,312
MARISHA: Can Grog and them let go? Is it going to
slam shut?

2897
03:55:09,312 --> 03:55:12,293
MATT: They found large rings and hooks to hook
them onto.

2898
03:55:12,293 --> 03:55:16,273
TRAVIS: We hurry to the other room.

2899
03:55:16,273 --> 03:55:20,040
TALIESIN: We hurry to the other room. If we can
get any inspiration, too, before we start this

2900
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:20,850
process.

2901
03:55:20,850 --> 03:55:23,042
LAURA: There's no inspiration-- Oh, no, he rested.
Yeah.

2902
03:55:23,042 --> 03:55:24,958
MATT: Short rest, so he has his inspiration back.

2903
03:55:24,958 --> 03:55:26,396
TALIESIN: Let's just smelt for now.

2904
03:55:26,396 --> 03:55:34,055
MARISHA: And now I can do my concentration. Let me
burn another spell. I'm doing Cat's Grace on you.

2905
03:55:34,055 --> 03:55:37,191
That fell to the wayside before.

2906
03:55:37,191 --> 03:55:40,236
MATT: You have advantage on dexterity-based
ability checks.

2907
03:55:40,236 --> 03:55:41,860
TRAVIS: Oh that's right, that's the one. Thank
you.

2908
03:55:41,860 --> 03:56:00,646
MATT: So. Let's see here. Grog, Percival. You head
to the original chamber before this. You find the

2909
03:56:00,646 --> 03:56:09,449
tongs and some of the metallic ingot-based molds.
You take in pieces of platinum equal to the

2910
03:56:09,449 --> 03:56:13,865
amounts you guys had pulled up before. How much
was it?

2911
03:56:13,865 --> 03:56:16,635
LAURA: 300 platinum each.

2912
03:56:16,635 --> 03:56:19,649
MATT: That was for the face. For the trammels.

2913
03:56:19,649 --> 03:56:23,916
LAURA: Oh. Would those little pyramids work to
make the trammels? Or it needs more?

2914
03:56:23,916 --> 03:56:28,308
MATT: Well, no. There's other molds there with the
smelting device.

2915
03:56:28,308 --> 03:56:35,496
LAURA: I got 4,920 platinum.

2916
03:56:35,496 --> 03:56:39,955
MATT: If I recall, it was 1,500 platinum per
piece, I believe.

2917
03:56:39,955 --> 03:56:47,187
TRAVIS: So 4,500. So enough for three trammels.

2918
03:56:47,187 --> 03:56:52,025
MATT: So you guys made the platinum transition
when you were in Vasselheim. And the reason it

2919
03:56:52,025 --> 03:56:56,409
takes so much is because even the natural platinum
that's out there has some impurities in the

2920
03:56:56,409 --> 03:57:01,893
process of the creating so you guys have to
repeatedly go through and burn and pull out impure

2921
03:57:01,893 --> 03:57:04,039
segments of the metals that come to the top.

2922
03:57:04,039 --> 03:57:06,772
LAURA: Make sure you use some of those pyramids we
made, though.

2923
03:57:06,772 --> 03:57:10,043
MARISHA: Yeah, so we don't waste that platinum
that we melted into triangles.

2924
03:57:10,043 --> 03:57:17,340
MATT: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a
blacksmithing tool check. This is with proficiency

2925
03:57:17,340 --> 03:57:20,525
bonus. It should be dexterity for this.

2926
03:57:20,525 --> 03:57:22,124
TALIESIN: At which you have advantage.

2927
03:57:22,124 --> 03:57:22,987
TRAVIS: Which I have advantage.

2928
03:57:22,987 --> 03:57:24,053
MATT: Correct. So you'd roll twice.

2929
03:57:24,053 --> 03:57:36,474
LAURA: 1,500 per trammel? Of platinum. Okay. We're
fine. Yeah. Can you get your calculator out? Never

2930
03:57:36,474 --> 03:57:38,177
mind. I can do this it myself.

2931
03:57:38,177 --> 03:57:41,462
TALIESIN: Yeah, figure out what dex plus
proficiency. Whatever your dex plus prof is.

2932
03:57:41,462 --> 03:57:47,697
TRAVIS: Oh, advantage. Right. I got it. 19.

2933
03:57:47,697 --> 03:57:50,881
SAM: Oh, do you want me to inspire you or
anything? Do you all need anything?

2934
03:57:50,881 --> 03:57:52,503
TALIESIN: How long does inspiration last for?

2935
03:57:52,503 --> 03:57:53,730
MATT: Up to ten minutes.

2936
03:57:53,730 --> 03:57:55,589
TALIESIN: Let's wait until the final--

2937
03:57:55,589 --> 03:58:05,965
MATT: All right. So. It takes you a good 20
minutes or so, 30 minutes or so per ingot to get

2938
03:58:05,965 --> 03:58:12,293
all the impurities out, to heat it and to scoop it
out. Eventually gets so you can form three bars of pure

2939
03:58:12,293 --> 03:58:20,696
platinum to the level that you know the requirements of
the trammel are. You look around. You don't see

2940
03:58:20,696 --> 03:58:28,133
any areas here to cool the metal. You didn't get a
good look at the other chamber necessarily to see

2941
03:58:28,133 --> 03:58:29,545
if there was something for it.

2942
03:58:29,545 --> 03:58:31,711
TRAVIS: I still have the Alchemy Jug with the
water in it.

2943
03:58:31,711 --> 03:58:34,949
LAURA: You might shatter that jug.

2944
03:58:34,949 --> 03:58:40,463
TALIESIN: There's probably everything we need in
here if we take a look around.

2945
03:58:40,463 --> 03:58:41,701
MARISHA: Do you need water?

2946
03:58:41,701 --> 03:58:43,100
TALIESIN: We're going to need water.

2947
03:58:43,100 --> 03:58:45,559
LAURA: Can I fly around and see what we can see?

2948
03:58:45,559 --> 03:58:51,256
MATT: Sure. You glance around and there's the two
machines over there that are still (crashing).

2949
03:58:51,256 --> 03:58:58,565
Behind and in the center of the two machines you
do see a trough about eight feet on one side and

2950
03:58:58,565 --> 03:59:05,062
three feet the width of it. It is empty,
however.

2951
03:59:05,062 --> 03:59:07,790
MARISHA: I go over and cast Create Water.

2952
03:59:07,790 --> 03:59:13,162
MATT: You manage to fill the trough, brimming with
cool, instantly created water.

2953
03:59:13,162 --> 03:59:14,494
LAURA: We've got a trough!

2954
03:59:14,494 --> 03:59:23,168
MATT: Back and forth, you guys take the molds with
tongs and (sizzling) quench the metal and pull out

2955
03:59:23,168 --> 03:59:28,687
the three heavy platinum ingots, ready for use on
the actual anvil.

2956
03:59:28,687 --> 03:59:31,875
LIAM: This just turned into an Aerosmith video.

2957
03:59:31,875 --> 03:59:40,767
MATT: (laughter) So. Now that you're working on
the forge, you have your Gauntlets on. The two of

2958
03:59:40,767 --> 03:59:46,737
you walk up and you have all these tools around
you. To fold the metal, you're going to need the

2959
03:59:46,737 --> 03:59:53,580
hammer. So you grab the hammer and the hammer's
pretty big. It's like a maul. It's a two-handed

2960
03:59:53,580 --> 03:59:54,566
hammer.

2961
03:59:54,566 --> 03:59:56,607
TRAVIS: I love this.

2962
03:59:56,607 --> 04:00:02,396
MATT: You need the beads of divinity for this next
stage.

2963
04:00:02,396 --> 04:00:03,591
TRAVIS: Who's got the beads?

2964
04:00:03,591 --> 04:00:05,364
LAURA and SAM: I've got a bead.

2965
04:00:05,364 --> 04:00:13,921
MATT: So you take the Ioun one, which has a faint
whitish-gray glow, and place it in the center of

2966
04:00:13,921 --> 04:00:17,864
the anvil. Go ahead and make a strength check,
Grog.

2967
04:00:17,864 --> 04:00:20,539
TRAVIS: Can I go into a rage?

2968
04:00:20,539 --> 04:00:21,991
MATT: You may.

2969
04:00:21,991 --> 04:00:31,864
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) That's even better. 25.

2970
04:00:31,864 --> 04:00:39,426
MATT: 25. With a giant echoing yell, (grunts) you
bring the hammer down and you watch a flash of

2971
04:00:39,426 --> 04:00:47,887
bright, vibrant white, faintly blue light flicker
and beam across the room. All of you for a second

2972
04:00:47,887 --> 04:00:53,014
have to hold your eyes and look away and as you
come back, the hammer is on top of the anvil. As

2973
04:00:53,014 --> 04:01:00,001
you pull it back, you see, where the bead was, there
is now a crushed dust of the same color, roughly

2974
04:01:00,001 --> 04:01:03,841
about the size of a plate. None of it's scattered
away from the anvil, it is a crystalline

2975
04:01:03,841 --> 04:01:05,758
diamond-like powder that remains.

2976
04:01:05,758 --> 04:01:11,164
TRAVIS: Do we fold this into one of the ingots?
One at a time?

2977
04:01:11,164 --> 04:01:12,405
TALIESIN: One at a time.

2978
04:01:12,405 --> 04:01:19,174
MATT: All right. So with you holding the tongs and
helping him, you take the hammer. I need you to

2979
04:01:19,174 --> 04:01:20,767
make a blacksmithing tool check.

2980
04:01:20,767 --> 04:01:23,170
TALIESIN: With advantage.

2981
04:01:23,170 --> 04:01:30,133
MATT: This is with strength, on this one. This is
hammering the metal and folding it into the

2982
04:01:30,133 --> 04:01:31,309
metal.

2983
04:01:31,309 --> 04:01:34,142
TRAVIS: That is a 19.

2984
04:01:34,142 --> 04:01:37,910
MATT: 19's fine. The hammering isn't too hard. The
different things have different difficulties, and

2985
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:43,193
so the folding isn't too bad. So with that, you
guys take the dust and you scatter it across the

2986
04:01:43,193 --> 04:01:47,330
metal and then hammer and fold, hammer and fold
and take more and scatter it across the metal as

2987
04:01:47,330 --> 04:01:51,230
it's still heated. Hammer and fold, then go and
take it off to the side to two of the coal areas,

2988
04:01:51,230 --> 04:01:54,619
and you watch as the furnaces burn and heat the
metal up again. You bring it back up to the steps

2989
04:01:54,619 --> 04:01:59,924
and hammer and fold, hammer and fold with more of
it until eventually, you've managed to hammer in

2990
04:01:59,924 --> 04:02:05,840
over the next 20 or so minutes, both of you
sweating, feeling a little bit of stiffness and

2991
04:02:05,840 --> 04:02:08,744
soreness in your arms from this process, but
you've been far worse.

2992
04:02:08,744 --> 04:02:15,370
LAURA: We're cheering them on the side. Good
forging! Fold that metal.

2993
04:02:15,370 --> 04:02:22,299
MATT: You eventually build a rod blank for your
first trammel using the bead of divinity from

2994
04:02:22,299 --> 04:02:28,007
Ioun. That is complete. So who's next?

2995
04:02:28,007 --> 04:02:29,814
TRAVIS: Whose bead is up next?

2996
04:02:29,814 --> 04:02:32,881
LAURA: Oh god. All right, here we go.

2997
04:02:32,881 --> 04:02:37,377
MATT: All right. So you take the faintly
yellowish-glowing bead of divinity from the

2998
04:02:37,377 --> 04:02:41,266
Dawnfather, place it onto the anvil. Make another
strength check, please.

2999
04:02:41,266 --> 04:02:43,679
LAURA: Does he need inspiration?

3000
04:02:43,679 --> 04:02:47,973
TRAVIS: Persistent rage. I'm raging balls this
whole time.

3001
04:02:47,973 --> 04:02:49,887
MATT: Do you still have an inspiration on you
right now?

3002
04:02:49,887 --> 04:02:50,848
TRAVIS: I do not.

3003
04:02:50,848 --> 04:02:51,871
LAURA: Scanlan?

3004
04:02:51,871 --> 04:02:52,985
SAM: Do you want me to inspire you?

3005
04:02:52,985 --> 04:02:54,519
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

3006
04:02:54,519 --> 04:03:01,531
SAM: All right, I will-- I go up to Grog and I tell
him: Grog, I'm going to tell you some words of

3007
04:03:01,531 --> 04:03:11,517
wisdom that I learned from a book once. A wise man
said, "The man who hast smelted verily didst also

3008
04:03:11,517 --> 04:03:12,784
"dealt it."

3009
04:03:12,784 --> 04:03:18,817
TRAVIS: Wisdom. Unparalleled wisdom!

3010
04:03:18,817 --> 04:03:22,643
MATT: So with advantage, and you're still raging
on this.

3011
04:03:22,643 --> 04:03:25,048
TRAVIS: Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. 25.

3012
04:03:25,048 --> 04:03:26,176
MATT: 25 again.

3013
04:03:26,176 --> 04:03:28,789
TRAVIS: 17 plus eight.

3014
04:03:28,789 --> 04:03:38,788
MATT: Both times you've hit 25, and the DC on this
is 25 on the sheet here. So with Pelor's bead of

3015
04:03:38,788 --> 04:03:44,915
divinity, you (crash) slam down a second time.
This time, you guys see a flash like you stare

3016
04:03:44,915 --> 04:03:53,485
into the sun for a split second. The heat in the
room grows even warmer for a moment, and it's like

3017
04:03:53,485 --> 04:04:01,004
being on the outside of a Meteor Swarm blast,
which you all recall very distinctly. You come

3018
04:04:01,004 --> 04:04:07,986
back and pull the hammer away, and there you see
the scattering dust of the Dawnfather's blessed

3019
04:04:07,986 --> 04:04:09,343
bead.

3020
04:04:09,343 --> 04:04:15,303
The two of you then go ahead and take in the next
ingot and begin. You heat it up, bring it back to

3021
04:04:15,303 --> 04:04:20,986
the anvil and begin to fold, scatter, fold,
scatter, reheat, bring back, fold, scatter.

3022
04:04:20,986 --> 04:04:23,973
Repeating the process until you get all through
it. I need you to go ahead and make another

3023
04:04:23,973 --> 04:04:25,403
blacksmithing tool check.

3024
04:04:25,403 --> 04:04:32,681
TRAVIS: Advantage because of the Cat's Grace. It's
a 19.

3025
04:04:32,681 --> 04:04:35,307
MATT: This is strength, still.

3026
04:04:35,307 --> 04:04:36,483
TRAVIS: Oh, it is?

3027
04:04:36,483 --> 04:04:39,985
MATT: Yeah. I'll tell you if it's dex or strength
because you're hammering the metal. He's turning

3028
04:04:39,985 --> 04:04:41,118
it over.

3029
04:04:41,118 --> 04:04:42,200
TRAVIS: 27.

3030
04:04:42,200 --> 04:04:47,050
MATT: 27. Yeah. Without an issue, you guys manage
to fold in your second trammel blank without

3031
04:04:47,050 --> 04:04:49,924
worry. Bringing you to the third one, the third
and final.

3032
04:04:49,924 --> 04:04:51,586
TRAVIS: Bead.

3033
04:04:51,586 --> 04:05:00,513
MATT: Producing and placing onto the anvil, Vax,
you leave behind there the small jet black smooth

3034
04:05:00,513 --> 04:05:02,610
oval bead.

3035
04:05:02,610 --> 04:05:07,795
TRAVIS: I reach into my pouch and I take out one
of my peas that I got, and I put it on the anvil.

3036
04:05:07,795 --> 04:05:10,353
LAURA: Don't do it. Get it off of there, Grog.

3037
04:05:10,353 --> 04:05:13,640
MATT: Strength check, Grog.

3038
04:05:13,640 --> 04:05:20,595
TRAVIS: Raging strength check. Okay. It's
inspiration time.

3039
04:05:20,595 --> 04:05:22,467
SAM: Inspiration time?

3040
04:05:22,467 --> 04:05:24,753
TRAVIS: I'm going to use the dice.

3041
04:05:24,753 --> 04:05:26,520
MARISHA: Because you didn't use it before?

3042
04:05:26,520 --> 04:05:28,340
LAURA: No, he hasn't used it. (gasps)

3043
04:05:28,340 --> 04:05:30,555
TRAVIS: It's a 24.

3044
04:05:30,555 --> 04:05:39,208
MATT: 24. (clang) You slam down. And you pull back
the hammer, and there it remains. Unshattered.

3045
04:05:39,208 --> 04:05:40,848
LAURA: Try it again.

3046
04:05:40,848 --> 04:05:43,391
TRAVIS: But my arms are really sore. I need a
massage.

3047
04:05:43,391 --> 04:05:45,396
LAURA: I'm going to over and rub his muscles.

3048
04:05:45,396 --> 04:05:55,163
LIAM: Grog, if you do this I will give you
something really cool. Really cool.

3049
04:05:55,163 --> 04:05:57,208
TRAVIS: By whose standards, yours or mine?

3050
04:05:57,208 --> 04:05:58,999
LIAM: Yours.

3051
04:05:58,999 --> 04:06:00,151
TRAVIS: All right.

3052
04:06:00,151 --> 04:06:01,761
LAURA: Do you want to inspire him again, Scanlan?

3053
04:06:01,761 --> 04:06:12,975
SAM: Yes, I do. I will sing to him. (singing) Pour
some platinum on thee and get it on an anvil. Pour

3054
04:06:12,975 --> 04:06:17,675
some platinum on thee when you need a trammel!

3055
04:06:17,675 --> 04:06:24,503
MATT: Take your d12. All right, Grog, as you try
again, pulling the large maul hammer up.

3056
04:06:24,503 --> 04:06:29,401
TRAVIS: No. Come on, Gil. That's dog shit.

3057
04:06:29,401 --> 04:06:32,269
LAURA: Oh no!

3058
04:06:32,269 --> 04:06:36,533
TRAVIS: I'm not even going to use the inspiration
because it won't get us there.

3059
04:06:36,533 --> 04:06:38,314
LAURA: Try one more time. Can he try again?

3060
04:06:38,314 --> 04:06:45,900
TRAVIS: Well, now hold on. I would have to
roll a 12. Of a d12.

3061
04:06:45,900 --> 04:06:47,814
SAM: You'd have to roll a 12?

3062
04:06:47,814 --> 04:06:48,864
LAURA: Try it, though.

3063
04:06:48,864 --> 04:06:50,065
MATT: It's up to you.

3064
04:06:50,065 --> 04:06:50,825
TRAVIS: Ten.

3065
04:06:50,825 --> 04:06:52,269
LAURA: Oh, motherfuck.

3066
04:06:52,269 --> 04:06:56,520
MATT: (impact) You slam down with a second hit. As
it hits, the reverberation of the impact fills the

3067
04:06:56,520 --> 04:07:03,381
room. You pull the hammer back and there it
remains, but you do see a mild crack through its

3068
04:07:03,381 --> 04:07:05,319
form.

3069
04:07:05,319 --> 04:07:11,523
TRAVIS: (panting) I'll try one more time. One
more. No inspiration.

3070
04:07:11,523 --> 04:07:14,041
MARISHA: Can I do anything to help him?

3071
04:07:14,041 --> 04:07:17,345
TALIESIN: No. Let's just do it.

3072
04:07:17,345 --> 04:07:19,150
MARISHA: Can I give him Guidance?

3073
04:07:19,150 --> 04:07:22,665
LAURA: Do you get any more inspiration, Scanlan?

3074
04:07:22,665 --> 04:07:25,485
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I can inspire one more time.

3075
04:07:25,485 --> 04:07:30,033
TRAVIS: Hold on. Let me try it without the
inspiration. Let me try.

3076
04:07:30,033 --> 04:07:34,730
MATT: If you give him Guidance, it will give him
an additional d4 he gets to add.

3077
04:07:34,730 --> 04:07:37,780
MARISHA: But it would get rid of his Cat's Grace,
but you're not using it.

3078
04:07:37,780 --> 04:07:39,184
MATT: Oh yeah, because it's concentration.

3079
04:07:39,184 --> 04:07:40,508
TRAVIS: Let me do it straight up.

3080
04:07:40,508 --> 04:07:46,042
MARISHA: It's a cantrip. I'm going to give you
Guidance! I'm doing it! Guidance!

3081
04:07:46,042 --> 04:07:49,720
MATT: So as you're doing this, Keyleth comes up
behind and then touches you.

3082
04:07:49,720 --> 04:07:53,655
MARISHA: Come on, Grog! Come on! That's my
Guidance.

3083
04:07:53,655 --> 04:07:58,422
TRAVIS: I didn't need it. 25 on the dot.

3084
04:07:58,422 --> 04:08:00,302
MARISHA: Good.

3085
04:08:00,302 --> 04:08:07,343
MATT: What could have been only two trammels, you
barely manage to succeed in properly shattering

3086
04:08:07,343 --> 04:08:14,220
and not ruining the third bead. (impact) As you
slam, all of you for a second see nothing but

3087
04:08:14,220 --> 04:08:21,122
darkness. All the light, all the flame, even the
heat of the room goes jet cold for an instant. And

3088
04:08:21,122 --> 04:08:28,372
all of a sudden, the light of the furnaces flicker
back on, the machine once more (crushing). The

3089
04:08:28,372 --> 04:08:33,359
engine slams and light filters back. You pull the
hammer back. You see a scattering of darkened

3090
04:08:33,359 --> 04:08:35,622
coal, obsidian dust remaining behind.

3091
04:08:35,622 --> 04:08:41,343
TRAVIS: I've never been so happy to see a 17
before. Oh my god.

3092
04:08:41,343 --> 04:08:43,031
LIAM: Work that Play-Doh. Come on.

3093
04:08:43,031 --> 04:08:45,754
MATT: With that, you two holding the tongs, you
take and fold the metal, hammer it, fold the

3094
04:08:45,754 --> 04:08:49,484
metal, hammer it. Make another blacksmithing
check. Go ahead and make your final blank.

3095
04:08:49,484 --> 04:08:51,625
LAURA: Okay, but now you can add things.

3096
04:08:51,625 --> 04:08:53,655
TRAVIS: I've got advantage. Is it strength or
dex?

3097
04:08:53,655 --> 04:08:55,351
MATT: This is strength still, this one.

3098
04:08:55,351 --> 04:08:56,797
MARISHA: You still have Guidance.

3099
04:08:56,797 --> 04:09:03,185
TRAVIS: But I get a d4 on top of it? Oh, that's
great. 26 without the other stuff.

3100
04:09:03,185 --> 04:09:06,617
MATT: Without an issue. So with that, you fold and
you have your three finished trammel blanks, each

3101
04:09:06,617 --> 04:09:12,209
one infused with the bead of divinity. Now you
need to draw them out. And you can do these as one

3102
04:09:12,209 --> 04:09:16,275
check for the three of them. So you go in and you
take these blanks, these long rods, and you heat

3103
04:09:16,275 --> 04:09:20,356
up the tip and bring it back, you holding with the
tongs. You begin to, at an angle, hammering it

3104
04:09:20,356 --> 04:09:24,361
against the top of the anvil, to eventually bring
it to a gradual point. I need you to go ahead and

3105
04:09:24,361 --> 04:09:31,474
make a blacksmithing check. This will be dexterity
because this is less of just hammering, this is a

3106
04:09:31,474 --> 04:09:40,821
little more careful manipulation of the metal. Did
you cast Cat's Grace on him again? Because if you

3107
04:09:40,821 --> 04:09:42,230
don't, it's not advantage.

3108
04:09:42,230 --> 04:09:43,453
MARISHA: Cat's Grace.

3109
04:09:43,453 --> 04:09:48,334
TRAVIS: Then I'll keep that. And then what was the
Guidance? Do I have Guidance any more?

3110
04:09:48,334 --> 04:09:49,413
MATT: No, you can't have both.

3111
04:09:49,413 --> 04:09:52,633
MARISHA: Do you want advantage or do you want that
extra d4?

3112
04:09:52,633 --> 04:09:54,159
TALIESIN: Advantage.

3113
04:09:54,159 --> 04:09:58,028
LAURA: So he can still add one d4 on this?

3114
04:09:58,028 --> 04:09:59,510
MARISHA: Pick one.

3115
04:09:59,510 --> 04:10:01,896
TRAVIS: It's a 15 with advantage.

3116
04:10:01,896 --> 04:10:03,231
MATT: It's a 15?

3117
04:10:03,231 --> 04:10:06,994
SAM: Shall I inspire him?

3118
04:10:06,994 --> 04:10:09,534
MATT: Well, you have to inspire him before he
makes the check.

3119
04:10:09,534 --> 04:10:12,139
TRAVIS: Because it's my dexterity modifier plus my
proficiency bonus, right?

3120
04:10:12,139 --> 04:10:13,589
MATT: Yes.

3121
04:10:13,589 --> 04:10:15,974
TALIESIN: Can I help with this?

3122
04:10:15,974 --> 04:10:17,436
MATT: You are helping with this.

3123
04:10:17,436 --> 04:10:18,632
TALIESIN: Oh god. Okay.

3124
04:10:18,632 --> 04:10:29,132
MATT: (laughs) We'll get to you shortly. So as you
begin to hammer it out, it's getting a little

3125
04:10:29,132 --> 04:10:35,458
fragile at some points. I'll let you make one more
check so you don't ruin one of the trammels.

3126
04:10:35,458 --> 04:10:36,595
TRAVIS: Advantage, right?

3127
04:10:36,595 --> 04:10:38,343
TALIESIN: Advantage and inspiration.

3128
04:10:38,343 --> 04:10:40,906
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'll inspire him again.

3129
04:10:40,906 --> 04:10:43,794
LAURA: He needs as much as you can give him,
Scanlan.

3130
04:10:43,794 --> 04:10:48,076
SAM: I will give him every inch of myself.

3131
04:10:48,076 --> 04:10:49,962
LAURA: So one?

3132
04:10:49,962 --> 04:10:52,617
(laughter)

3133
04:10:52,617 --> 04:10:55,629
SAM: One by one by one, yeah.

3134
04:10:55,629 --> 04:11:08,060
TRAVIS: My god. That's better. Okay. That's a 24.
Should I use the inspiration?

3135
04:11:08,060 --> 04:11:09,915
SAM: Yes, you should.

3136
04:11:09,915 --> 04:11:12,279
TRAVIS: 29.

3137
04:11:12,279 --> 04:11:18,022
MATT: 29. So this time, seeing where the
imperfections were in the hammering you initially

3138
04:11:18,022 --> 04:11:22,770
did and curving and bringing fragility to one of
the trammels, you double back, heat up, and

3139
04:11:22,770 --> 04:11:29,706
correct the mistake. Over the next ten minutes or
so, you both carefully work to bring each to a

3140
04:11:29,706 --> 04:11:36,108
razor point at the end of these large platinum
javelins now. They're thicker on one side and come

3141
04:11:36,108 --> 04:11:40,051
to an impossible point at the other. You have
three of these base trammels now complete.

3142
04:11:40,051 --> 04:11:43,790
LAURA: Now we got to twist them?

3143
04:11:43,790 --> 04:11:45,501
TRAVIS: No, we got to put the runes in.

3144
04:11:45,501 --> 04:11:51,467
MATT: So now you have to twist them. This is where
you bring up the leg vice. So you go ahead and you

3145
04:11:51,467 --> 04:11:56,767
clamp it in there. This is without your help. This
is now you taking and heating the metal and

3146
04:11:56,767 --> 04:11:59,407
twisting it as you go, so make another
blacksmithing check.

3147
04:11:59,407 --> 04:12:02,696
MARISHA: I can guide you. I can do nothing else.

3148
04:12:02,696 --> 04:12:04,175
MATT: This is a dexterity-based.

3149
04:12:04,175 --> 04:12:08,273
MARISHA: Oh, it's dexterity still? Then keep the
advantage. You have advantage.

3150
04:12:08,273 --> 04:12:10,633
TRAVIS: (sobbing) I'm tired of this.

3151
04:12:10,633 --> 04:12:12,507
LAURA: Does he have any more inspiration?

3152
04:12:12,507 --> 04:12:13,880
SAM: Sure. I can inspire him.

3153
04:12:13,880 --> 04:12:15,411
LAURA: Wait, keep inspiring.

3154
04:12:15,411 --> 04:12:16,488
TALIESIN: He already rolled.

3155
04:12:16,488 --> 04:12:19,076
LAURA: But he hasn't announced it.

3156
04:12:19,076 --> 04:12:20,176
MATT: He already rolled.

3157
04:12:20,176 --> 04:12:23,182
TRAVIS: It's a 26. It's okay.

3158
04:12:23,182 --> 04:12:29,743
MATT: So with that, you, one by one, slowly using
the clamp, twist, heat it up, grab, clamp, twist,

3159
04:12:29,743 --> 04:12:35,311
hammer, twist and continue this process for each
trammel as everyone looks on with bated breath.

3160
04:12:35,311 --> 04:12:42,737
The deafening sound of the engine-like
contraptions fill the space like a heartbeat.

3161
04:12:42,737 --> 04:12:48,112
Their rhythm gets into your muscles and the aches
begin to fade as you focus on the hammers in

3162
04:12:48,112 --> 04:12:58,150
unison with the (slamming). Becomes this very
primal forging-of-the-world vision to see Grog

3163
04:12:58,150 --> 04:13:03,036
atop this anvil for over an hour at this point
now, sweating and hammering away at these

3164
04:13:03,036 --> 04:13:08,353
trammels. A vision of the Allhammer once, long
ago, forging weapons of old, long-forgotten and

3165
04:13:08,353 --> 04:13:12,996
lost, now Grog sits here, forging the means of
sealing one of the biggest threats to the Prime

3166
04:13:12,996 --> 04:13:19,530
Material Plane by himself. As you finish twisting
the final trammel, you pull it up (sizzling),

3167
04:13:19,530 --> 04:13:23,868
quenching them in the water that you left behind.
And as you pull up, you can see as the steam

3168
04:13:23,868 --> 04:13:29,586
rises, the three twisted javelins of pure platinum
ready for the final scrolling.

3169
04:13:29,586 --> 04:13:37,496
TRAVIS: (panting) Okay. Okay, give me the cool
thing.

3170
04:13:37,496 --> 04:13:44,099
LIAM: I don't want to do that with everybody here.
I'm not lying to you. It's really cool.

3171
04:13:44,099 --> 04:13:46,963
TRAVIS: I'm too tired to be upset about it.

3172
04:13:46,963 --> 04:13:48,614
LIAM: Later. I promise.

3173
04:13:48,614 --> 04:13:51,858
MARISHA: What do you--

3174
04:13:51,858 --> 04:13:56,138
TALIESIN: Well, let's see. What do I have to do?

3175
04:13:56,138 --> 04:14:03,639
MATT: The only hammer here is that maul, but all
the chiseling and tinkering work takes a much

3176
04:14:03,639 --> 04:14:05,007
smaller, more delicate hammer.

3177
04:14:05,007 --> 04:14:07,035
TRAVIS: I do have the Dwarven Thrower.

3178
04:14:07,035 --> 04:14:09,344
MATT: It's going to have to be a smaller edge than
that.

3179
04:14:09,344 --> 04:14:11,406
LAURA: Like what? Whisper?

3180
04:14:11,406 --> 04:14:12,388
LIAM: Edge? Yeah?

3181
04:14:12,388 --> 04:14:13,922
MATT: It has to be a hammer.

3182
04:14:13,922 --> 04:14:15,709
MARISHA: Like a rock hammer.

3183
04:14:15,709 --> 04:14:18,563
LAURA: Can we look around for a little teeny
hammer?

3184
04:14:18,563 --> 04:14:19,996
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3185
04:14:19,996 --> 04:14:21,243
SAM: Teeny hammer?

3186
04:14:21,243 --> 04:14:28,411
LAURA: 12 for me, so probably not so much.

3187
04:14:28,411 --> 04:14:29,931
TALIESIN: Make an investigation check?

3188
04:14:29,931 --> 04:14:31,334
TRAVIS: Me too.

3189
04:14:31,334 --> 04:14:32,580
LIAM: 18 for me.

3190
04:14:32,580 --> 04:14:34,301
TALIESIN: Glad I got that roll out of the way.

3191
04:14:34,301 --> 04:14:38,741
TRAVIS: 15?

3192
04:14:38,741 --> 04:14:44,227
MATT: Looking around, all the other tools are for
different things, but there's no other hammer.

3193
04:14:44,227 --> 04:14:46,403
There's the one singular giant hammer on the
chain.

3194
04:14:46,403 --> 04:14:49,033
LAURA: Have you picked it up? Maybe it changes
shape.

3195
04:14:49,033 --> 04:14:51,145
TALIESIN: I'm going to try picking the hammer up.

3196
04:14:51,145 --> 04:14:52,823
MATT: Okay. You pick up the hammer.

3197
04:14:52,823 --> 04:14:56,817
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and attune to it.

3198
04:14:56,817 --> 04:15:01,010
MATT: So you take a bit of time to attune with it,
if you feel that's something you could try.

3199
04:15:01,010 --> 04:15:02,513
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine it.

3200
04:15:02,513 --> 04:15:05,373
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

3201
04:15:05,373 --> 04:15:10,307
TALIESIN: Make another arcana check. Let's see
what happens. Oh, that's better. 21.

3202
04:15:10,307 --> 04:15:17,520
MATT: 21. This is definitely an enchanted hammer.
You take time with it and focus, and once you feel

3203
04:15:17,520 --> 04:15:20,808
the essence of attunement begin to drift into this
hammer, you unattune from one of your other items

3204
04:15:20,808 --> 04:15:27,890
and you will it. The hammer actually (shrinking)
shrinks down into a small, light hammer. Ball-peen

3205
04:15:27,890 --> 04:15:28,708
hammer.

3206
04:15:28,708 --> 04:15:30,483
TRAVIS: Smart move.

3207
04:15:30,483 --> 04:15:33,126
TALIESIN: I'll drop Animus for now.

3208
04:15:33,126 --> 04:15:36,920
MARISHA: Your coffee-stained artifacts.

3209
04:15:36,920 --> 04:15:39,241
LIAM: I dropped my travel mug.

3210
04:15:39,241 --> 04:15:52,813
MATT: So. Now with this tinier hammer in your
grasp, you walk over and put the trammels on the

3211
04:15:52,813 --> 04:15:58,193
anvil. You grab some of the chiseling implements,
and the two of you together begin to work. And

3212
04:15:58,193 --> 04:16:03,862
you're mainly there taking the hammer and driving
the back of the chisel while he's guiding the

3213
04:16:03,862 --> 04:16:08,006
design because you don't know what vision he has.
So you've done all the groundwork. You've built

3214
04:16:08,006 --> 04:16:12,491
the structure, the base plate for it. But you have
all the intricate designs in the head that Ioun

3215
04:16:12,491 --> 04:16:16,770
imparted with you. So now you almost go into a
trance with the chiseling tools and you have three

3216
04:16:16,770 --> 04:16:20,046
in your hands and you're juggling them behind and
you're staring ahead. It's really weird to watch

3217
04:16:20,046 --> 04:16:24,842
Percival go from this focused individual to
staring off into space and his hands take over and

3218
04:16:24,842 --> 04:16:29,112
begins moving the chisels along. Each one of them
almost too fast for you to keep up and you get to

3219
04:16:29,112 --> 04:16:32,975
the point where you're like (rapid hammering).
Trying to keep up with him as he's moving along.

3220
04:16:32,975 --> 04:16:38,628
As you do, you watch as this intricate scrolling
begins to appear and dig itself into the side of

3221
04:16:38,628 --> 04:16:43,026
each trammel. He rotates it with the tongs, moves
into place, gets the chisel and removes it,

3222
04:16:43,026 --> 04:16:47,956
rotates it again and as this continues, it gets
faster and faster and faster. I need you to go

3223
04:16:47,956 --> 04:16:50,386
ahead to make a tinkering check.

3224
04:16:50,386 --> 04:16:52,973
MARISHA: Do you want any Guidance?

3225
04:16:52,973 --> 04:16:54,976
TAILESIN: Oh, I'll take anything I can get.

3226
04:16:54,976 --> 04:16:56,818
LAURA: Cat's Grace is what, dexterity?

3227
04:16:56,818 --> 04:17:03,017
TALIESIN: Well, technically that's a dex check, so
if you have Cat's Grace I'll take it.

3228
04:17:03,017 --> 04:17:04,119
MARISHA: Is it a dex check?

3229
04:17:04,119 --> 04:17:05,432
MATT: It's what you gave to Grog earlier.

3230
04:17:05,432 --> 04:17:11,253
MARISHA: Okay. Then I will give you Cat's Grace at
third level because my 2nd-level spells are tapped.

3231
04:17:11,253 --> 04:17:15,422
And so are now my 3rd-level spells. Nothing more.

3232
04:17:15,422 --> 04:17:19,407
TALIESIN: If you have any inspiration, I'll also
take it.

3233
04:17:19,407 --> 04:17:29,084
SAM: Yes, sure. I'll give you some. I will sing to
you. I will sing: (singing) bang bang, Percy's ball-peen

3234
04:17:29,084 --> 04:17:38,195
hammer goes down, upon the ground! Bang bang,
Percy's ball-peen hammer makes a really, really

3235
04:17:38,195 --> 04:17:41,427
big sound. (vocalizing)

3236
04:17:41,427 --> 04:17:47,821
MATT: The actual heat from the Core Anvil is
enough that when you hold the trammel against it,

3237
04:17:47,821 --> 04:17:51,185
it gives it just enough of a malleable edge for
you to go ahead and chisel through it without

3238
04:17:51,185 --> 04:17:56,202
issue. As you're going, it's three checks: one for
each trammel. So the first one?

3239
04:17:56,202 --> 04:18:03,644
TALIESIN: That's without inspiration. That's 31.

3240
04:18:03,644 --> 04:18:11,675
MATT: 31. (skittering, clanging) After about five
minutes or so, you finish and grab one of the

3241
04:18:11,675 --> 04:18:18,060
trammels and (clang) onto the ground. Begin on the
other. (skittering)

3242
04:18:18,060 --> 04:18:19,719
TRAVIS: Slow down!

3243
04:18:19,719 --> 04:18:23,880
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (groan)

3244
04:18:23,880 --> 04:18:36,416
MARISHA: Try again. Inspiration it?

3245
04:18:36,416 --> 04:18:42,073
TALIESIN: I might be able to inspiration this
because that was a really bad roll. Both of them

3246
04:18:42,073 --> 04:18:49,220
are the same. Both of them are two. And this is
not one of those things where I can fix. It's

3247
04:18:49,220 --> 04:18:50,542
either good or it's bad.

3248
04:18:50,542 --> 04:18:53,191
LAURA: We might be able to fix it.

3249
04:18:53,191 --> 04:18:57,378
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and add a little bit of
inspiration, maybe.

3250
04:18:57,378 --> 04:18:59,331
MARISHA: (groans)

3251
04:18:59,331 --> 04:19:02,316
TALIESIN: That's not very good. That's 17.

3252
04:19:02,316 --> 04:19:13,540
MATT: 17. Okay. The second trammel, as you're
chiseling along, you feel as the metal (cracking)

3253
04:19:13,540 --> 04:19:24,368
begins to bend and snap in one place. It's still
one piece. (sighs) The DC has gone up, but you get

3254
04:19:24,368 --> 04:19:25,650
one more shot at that one.

3255
04:19:25,650 --> 04:19:27,957
TALIESIN: Can I get one more inspiration if you
got any? Are you out?

3256
04:19:27,957 --> 04:19:31,719
SAM: I've used five, and I think I get six.

3257
04:19:31,719 --> 04:19:35,844
TALIESIN: Let's take another one. Just in case
because Jesus fucking Christ.

3258
04:19:35,844 --> 04:19:37,615
MATT: The DC was 20. Now it's 25.

3259
04:19:37,615 --> 04:19:38,871
TALIESIN: Okay.

3260
04:19:38,871 --> 04:19:41,962
MATT: If this fails, it's going to break a
trammel.

3261
04:19:41,962 --> 04:19:43,236
LAURA: Oh my god!

3262
04:19:43,236 --> 04:19:46,989
TALIESIN: Please. I will happily take that
inspiration, please.

3263
04:19:46,989 --> 04:19:50,140
SAM: All right. I will inspire you with some
bullshit.

3264
04:19:50,140 --> 04:19:51,790
MARISHA: No one has any other type of Guidance or
anything?

3265
04:19:51,790 --> 04:19:53,163
LAURA: I'm looking. I've got nothing.

3266
04:19:53,163 --> 04:19:55,919
TRAVIS: I don't have anything; I just hit things!

3267
04:19:55,919 --> 04:20:04,238
TALIESIN: It's a skill check. It's not a save. Oh
wait. I don't get to add anything from the hammer

3268
04:20:04,238 --> 04:20:05,317
for this?

3269
04:20:05,317 --> 04:20:09,277
MATT: No. The hammer is allowing the process to
take place.

3270
04:20:09,277 --> 04:20:13,681
LIAM: Do we need to do this right now? Can we take
nappies and come back?

3271
04:20:13,681 --> 04:20:17,591
TALIESIN: I think it has to be soft, right?

3272
04:20:17,591 --> 04:20:20,888
LIAM: You would have a whole other batch of
inspirations in the morning.

3273
04:20:20,888 --> 04:20:22,874
SAM: Yeah, but he's got one more shot at this.

3274
04:20:22,874 --> 04:20:25,446
TALIESIN: I think we have to do it now, right?

3275
04:20:25,446 --> 04:20:27,415
MATT: The trance is there. It's up to you.

3276
04:20:27,415 --> 04:20:33,140
TALIESIN: Give me one more inspiration if you can,
and we'll see where we go.

3277
04:20:33,140 --> 04:20:43,213
SAM: I will sing one more song to inspire you.
I'll sing: (singing) Here's a little song I wrote! It's

3278
04:20:43,213 --> 04:20:51,142
filled with inspiration note for note. Don't fuck
up! Or I'll kill you!

3279
04:20:51,142 --> 04:20:56,288
(laughter)

3280
04:20:56,288 --> 04:20:57,396
MATT: All righty.

3281
04:20:57,396 --> 04:20:58,680
TALIESIN: I don't feel good.

3282
04:20:58,680 --> 04:21:03,310
TRAVIS: One at a time.

3283
04:21:03,310 --> 04:21:06,290
TALIESIN: That'll do. 18, 28, 30.

3284
04:21:06,290 --> 04:21:07,419
MATT: 30.

3285
04:21:07,419 --> 04:21:10,167
TRAVIS: And we have the inspiration for the third
one.

3286
04:21:10,167 --> 04:21:16,067
MATT: You managed to complete the scrolling on the
trammel. The trammel is still noticeably fragile,

3287
04:21:16,067 --> 04:21:24,131
but it seems functional. The enchantment will be
channeled. So second trammel's done. Final check

3288
04:21:24,131 --> 04:21:25,658
on the third and final trammel.

3289
04:21:25,658 --> 04:21:26,745
TRAVIS: Come on. Jesus.

3290
04:21:26,745 --> 04:21:31,557
MARISHA: This is so stressful.

3291
04:21:31,557 --> 04:21:45,539
TALIESIN: That's not bad. Yeah! So that's 34!

3292
04:21:45,539 --> 04:21:49,161
(cheering)

3293
04:21:49,161 --> 04:21:51,563
TALIESIN: Rolled a 12 on the inspiration dice.

3294
04:21:51,563 --> 04:21:55,921
MATT: With that, the feverish pace of the
scrolling as you work across the final trammel,

3295
04:21:55,921 --> 04:22:01,270
Grog, it's almost to the point where he'll move
the chisel to a place, you'll hammer, move back

3296
04:22:01,270 --> 04:22:04,892
and he's going too fast and he has to go back. And
while he's not even looking at you, the chisel

3297
04:22:04,892 --> 04:22:08,461
will clang multiple times across the side of it,
telling you to fucking hit the back of it with the

3298
04:22:08,461 --> 04:22:13,274
hammer. You take it and slam it, move along,
eventually coming across each side of the

3299
04:22:13,274 --> 04:22:18,064
spiraling trammel to completion. At that point,
the hammer still in your grasp, you back away.

3300
04:22:18,064 --> 04:22:24,638
Percival, you take it and the heated edge of it is
burning into your hand a little bit and you walk

3301
04:22:24,638 --> 04:22:33,601
over and drop it into the trough water. (sizzling)
Turn around, drop it next to the third and final

3302
04:22:33,601 --> 04:22:34,919
piece.

3303
04:22:34,919 --> 04:22:36,150
TALIESIN: And I faint.

3304
04:22:36,150 --> 04:22:38,333
(laughter)

3305
04:22:38,333 --> 04:22:45,764
MATT: And as Percival hits-- He passes out onto
the stairs, half-leaning onto the stairs. You

3306
04:22:45,764 --> 04:22:51,495
catch him. Grog, you look at your feet where
Percival left the last piece and you reach down

3307
04:22:51,495 --> 04:22:56,439
and pick up the three trammels. They're about that
long, each of them, and they're these heavy

3308
04:22:56,439 --> 04:23:01,510
spikes that come to a gradual spiraling twist at
the tip. They're covered in intricate, beautiful

3309
04:23:01,510 --> 04:23:06,948
scrolling of some sort of arcane language that you
are unfamiliar with, and you don't think you've

3310
04:23:06,948 --> 04:23:10,489
been so proud to be part of crafting anything like
this before.

3311
04:23:10,489 --> 04:23:13,814
TRAVIS: These are obviously too dangerous for this
world, and I walk over to the lava.

3312
04:23:13,814 --> 04:23:17,158
(laughter)

3313
04:23:17,158 --> 04:23:19,645
TRAVIS: Kidding!

3314
04:23:19,645 --> 04:23:24,970
LAURA: This is a step up from fine leather boots,
Grog.

3315
04:23:24,970 --> 04:23:26,254
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's true.

3316
04:23:26,254 --> 04:23:32,410
MATT: And with the completion of the trammels,
this leg of your journey now complete, we're going

3317
04:23:32,410 --> 04:23:39,543
to close tonight's episode. Good game. (sighs)
We'll pick up this at GenCon next week at our live show.

3318
04:23:39,543 --> 04:23:43,502
MARISHA: So GenCon we're going to start with
trying to get out of an active volcano?

3319
04:23:43,502 --> 04:23:46,853
TALIESIN: Well, I think we'll assume that we're
going to take a mansion rest and we'll come out of

3320
04:23:46,853 --> 04:23:49,139
a mansion rest. Can we assume that's going to be
it?

3321
04:23:49,139 --> 04:23:54,440
MATT: If you want to take that point now, we'll
say with the end of this episode you guys take a

3322
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:57,503
mansion rest? No?

3323
04:23:57,503 --> 04:23:58,411
TRAVIS: No?

3324
04:23:58,411 --> 04:24:02,436
LAURA: Or are you tapped out? Do you have any
spells left, Scanlan?

3325
04:24:02,436 --> 04:24:05,890
SAM: I saved one level eight spell for such a thing.

3326
04:24:05,890 --> 04:24:07,903
LAURA: So we head into the mansion.

3327
04:24:07,903 --> 04:24:11,967
MARISHA: And I technically have one 7th-level
spell, so if we want to go into the mansion and

3328
04:24:11,967 --> 04:24:17,002
then I can Plane Shift us home, we can do that. Or
wherever we want.

3329
04:24:17,002 --> 04:24:19,972
TALIESIN: So we can Plane Shift, mansion wherever
we need.

3330
04:24:19,972 --> 04:24:24,389
TRAVIS: And if we go into the mansion, the first
purple servant that hands me a salad, I behead

3331
04:24:24,389 --> 04:24:28,407
unless it's the GoFiBePo.

3332
04:24:28,407 --> 04:24:31,470
MATT: So are you going to long rest and then Plane
Shift or Plane Shift and then long rest wherever

3333
04:24:31,470 --> 04:24:32,938
you land?

3334
04:24:32,938 --> 04:24:34,311
MARISHA: Plane Shift and then long rest.

3335
04:24:34,311 --> 04:24:42,642
LAURA: If we're in the mansion, he can't see us.
So that's the only thing. It might be good to rest

3336
04:24:42,642 --> 04:24:46,428
inside the mansion so he can't attack us before we
attack him.

3337
04:24:46,428 --> 04:24:48,756
TALIESIN: Are we going straight to him?

3338
04:24:48,756 --> 04:24:50,309
LAURA: We don't know.

3339
04:24:50,309 --> 04:24:51,399
TALIESIN: All right. Mansion.

3340
04:24:51,399 --> 04:24:56,079
MARISHA: I will be burning my 7th-level spell at
the top of the day instead of at the end.

3341
04:24:56,079 --> 04:24:59,086
TALIESIN: So let's Plane Shift somewhere and
mansion.

3342
04:24:59,086 --> 04:25:08,724
MARISHA: Well, no. I can only Plane Shift us on
this plane by basically hacking the spell because

3343
04:25:08,724 --> 04:25:15,082
the mansion is another plane of existence. So I
can't Plane Shift us on this plane. I have to

3344
04:25:15,082 --> 04:25:16,535
plane to another plane.

3345
04:25:16,535 --> 04:25:20,894
TALIESIN: We need to rest. Let's rest. Yeah,
ignore it.

3346
04:25:20,894 --> 04:25:26,677
MARIRSHA: We'll figure it out at GenCon. We'll
figure it out in Indianapolis.

3347
04:25:26,677 --> 04:25:28,453
LAURA: Fuck it, we'll do it live!

3348
04:25:28,453 --> 04:25:30,302
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: We'll do it live!

3349
04:25:30,302 --> 04:25:36,863
MATT: All righty, then. So. We'll pick up there
next week at GenCon. (exhales) All right, guys.

3350
04:25:36,863 --> 04:25:44,608
TRAVIS: That fucking giant sword-swinging bastard!
Is he even wearing underpants under that? We don't know.

3351
04:25:44,608 --> 04:25:47,240
LAURA: No, he's not. I saw his balls. I saw his
golden balls.

3352
04:25:47,240 --> 04:25:51,321
LIAM: It's a big iron pendulum swinging around.

3353
04:25:51,321 --> 04:25:53,649
TRAVIS: Legendary action: the nut swing.

3354
04:25:53,649 --> 04:25:55,219
MATT: Yeah.

3355
04:25:55,219 --> 04:26:01,851
LAURA: Oh goodness gracious, we got to get all of
our stuff. Do we need to bring our own binder to

3356
04:26:01,851 --> 04:26:02,708
GenCon?

3357
04:26:02,708 --> 04:26:08,733
MATT: Yes, bring your binders. Bring your sheets.
Otherwise, the rest of you, thank you for joining

3358
04:26:08,733 --> 04:26:13,901
us, as always. Rest well. See you next week, and is
it Thursday yet? Good night.

3359
04:26:13,901 --> 04:26:16,298
TRAVIS: Beautiful map, Matt. That was amazing.

3360
04:26:16,298 --> 04:31:45,992
