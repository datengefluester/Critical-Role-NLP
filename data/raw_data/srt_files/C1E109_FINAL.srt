1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,325
BRIAN: What's up, GenCon?!

2
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:13,896
(cheering)

3
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:19,203
BRIAN: That's a lot of people. How you guys
doing?

4
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:23,196
(cheering)

5
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:36,127
BRIAN: Oh my god. Send me the bill for your plane
ticket! If you guys think this outfit is

6
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:45,957
ridiculous, you have literally not seen anything
yet. Okay. Thank you for waiting. What?

7
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,251
(muffled shout)

8
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:55,065
BRIAN: You know what's up, brother. Thank you guys
for waiting. I heard, Tico told me that people

9
00:00:55,065 --> 00:01:03,155
were out there at 6:00am waiting? You guys! We're
about to watch people play Dungeons and Dragons!

10
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:07,826
(cheering)

11
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:15,264
BRIAN: What is happening?! We are alive at the
best moment in history. Right now, there's a

12
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,115
stadium full of people basically watching this
live on the internet, and going,

13
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,397
"How did Ashley let him wear that?"

14
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:30,026
(laughter)

15
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:43,455
BRIAN: Okay, let's start. Let's get started.
(laughs) It is I, your host for the evening,

16
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:54,962
Recession-Friendly Ryan Seacrest. This outfit is
what happens when you take 'shrooms before

17
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,166
creating a Saint's Row character.

18
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,346
(laughter)

19
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:06,661
BRIAN: All right. You guys already sound a little
warmed up.

20
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:14,747
(cheering)

21
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:24,374
BRIAN: Yeah. But! Just to make sure, because the
live shows are all about the audience

22
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:31,836
participation. We're going to go over a couple of
rules for that really fast, but before we do, I

23
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:37,106
get paid to be the hype man, so let me get you
guys hyped up.

24
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:48,248
(cheering)

25
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:56,749
BRIAN: Okay, wait. Okay. When I say, "Tary," you
say "Who?" Tary!

26
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:57,846
AUDIENCE: Who!

27
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:58,532
BRIAN: Tary!

28
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,384
AUDIENCE: Who!

29
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:02,757
BRIAN: When I say, "Tary," you say, "Who?" Tary!

30
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:03,636
AUDIENCE: Who?

31
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,419
BRIAN: Tary!

32
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,257
AUDIENCE: Who?

33
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:08,377
BRIAN: When I say, "Tary," you say "What!" Tary!

34
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:09,307
AUDIENCE: What!

35
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,136
BRAIN: Tary!

36
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,032
AUDIENCE: What!

37
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:19,758
BRAIN: Goddamn. Okay, that's it. Warm-up time
over. That was easy. Okay, here's the deal.

38
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:24,707
Sometimes, people in the Twitch chat don't like
Critical Role Live because the audience

39
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:40,188
participates. Those people-- (laughs) Those
people-- hold on. I just want to say, with all the

40
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:44,849
love and respect in my heart, those people can
tune off right now.

41
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:51,213
(cheering)

42
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:55,319
BRIAN: Because I don't know about you, but when
I'm at home watching Critical Role, and someone

43
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,537
gets a "how do you want to do this," I fucking
scream!

44
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:02,618
(cheering)

45
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:15,310
BRIAN: Okay. Here's what you can do. You can
laugh, you can cheer, you can scream, you can cry.

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:22,265
You can stand up and blow the roof off this place
if something cool happens. You can hug your

47
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:29,228
neighbor, and get drunk after the show if
something sad happens. And then someone please

48
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:37,243
tweet me the bar that you're at, and I will join
you... with Travis Willingham's American Express.

49
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:54,474
Which is currently in my fanny pack. Please do not
shout rules. Please do not shout advice. Please do

50
00:04:54,474 --> 00:05:05,286
not shout corrections. Please do not shout ideas.
Odds are, your idea is probably better that what

51
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:12,299
some of the stuff they're going to come up with
is. However, part of the thing that is so

52
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:19,236
endearing about this show is watching these
nerdy-ass voice actors figure out how to play

53
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,171
Dungeons and Dragons.

54
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:34,858
Isn't it? That's what I love about it. Okay. It's
disruptive, and it'll light the community on fire,

55
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:41,151
and we like to keep these live things, but all
that being said, please laugh, please cheer.

56
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:44,797
There's going to be so much cool stuff. Oh, I was
supposed to throw these out.

57
00:05:44,797 --> 00:06:01,490
(cheering)

58
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:14,883
BRIAN: (laughs) Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.
Who came here from outside the US? Cheer.

59
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:17,289
(cheering)

60
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:34,917
BRIAN: Wow! Really? For this? Look at me! Without
further ado, I would like to introduce the cast of

61
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:38,248
a little show we like to call Critical Role.

62
00:06:38,248 --> 00:07:02,317
Travis Willingham!

63
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:17,319
Laura Bailey!

64
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:31,629
Liam O'Brien!

65
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:44,008
Marisha Ray!

66
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:58,358
Taliesin Jaffe!

67
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:40,569
Children, shield your eyes. I present to you: Sam
Riegel!

68
00:08:40,569 --> 00:09:03,101
And the man that brought us all together. Ladies
and gentlemen, Matthew Mercer!

69
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:07,455
The cast of Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen!

70
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:23,302
(cheering)

71
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:24,237
TRAVIS: All right.

72
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:28,180
LAURA: All right.

73
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,416
TRAVIS: Fuck! Fucking shit!

74
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:59,406
(cheering)

75
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:08,081
MATT: So that's surreal. Oh man. Well, we're all
so excited for you guys to join us tonight, both

76
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:13,713
here in person and out there on the internet. How
crazy is it that we live in a world where, right

77
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,615
now, we have people here live in this fantastic
theater to watch Dungeons and Dragons?

78
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:28,661
(cheering)

79
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:34,870
MATT: For all the crazy shit going on in the
world, it's nice to know that we can carve some

80
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,779
good out of it here tonight.

81
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:42,933
(cheering)

82
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,359
MATT: And in that regard, so we don't keep you too
long before we can get to the game which you all

83
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:54,712
came here to watch, let's go through some quick
announcements. Very quick. In fact, I think the

84
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:57,420
big announcement, if Liam and Taliesin want to
take that?

85
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:10,036
LIAM: Sure. So Taliesin and I have been working on
something for about a year, with around 89 artists

86
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:22,458
from our community. It's been a glimmer in our eye
for over a year, and it is almost here. We're

87
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:27,906
going to be releasing, in the fall from the Geek &amp;
Sundry store, a Critical Role art book.

88
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:50,400
(cheering)

89
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,162
SAM: Liam, they're excited about reading. They
love books!

90
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:58,302
TALIESIN: We've only told them about the pictures
so far.

91
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:03,805
LIAM: You guys know what a crucial part of this
community the artists have become, and we have

92
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:10,883
selected 89 artists from many more; there wasn't
enough-- pages are limited, do I have a page

93
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:11,963
number on here?

94
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:15,115
TALIESIN: 260 something pages?

95
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,044
BRIAN: 256, Liam!

96
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,951
TALIESIN: 256 pages.

97
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:29,129
LIAM: We've seen it, and it is beautiful. There's
going to be a deluxe edition and a standard

98
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:36,164
edition. It will be available for sale in the Geek
&amp; Sundry store in the late fall, published by

99
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:37,492
Hunters Books.

100
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:48,278
TALIESIN: I'll say, regardless of what version,
when you actually get the book, it's going to be

101
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:57,245
treated as an artifact from the Cobalt Reserve, so
there's going to be historical texts and writings

102
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:04,390
from various librarians in the Cobalt Reserve,
chronicling the adventures of Vox Machina,

103
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:18,099
including a lot of fun Easter eggs. And there will
be some fun Easter eggs in there, there may even

104
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:21,354
be some background meta data that doesn't really
exist anywhere else.

105
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:27,358
LIAM: Yeah. This is not your basic, go the CVS
store and get a photo book made. A lot of love and

106
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:34,218
care went into this. We've been talking with
artists for months and months. A lot of blood,

107
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:37,223
sweat and tears have gone into this. We're very
grateful to the artists who are involved, some of

108
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,944
them are in this audience tonight; thank you.

109
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:52,148
(cheering)

110
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:57,631
LIAM: We stood around and looked at a proof of
this about a week ago, and I might have gotten a

111
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,924
little verklempt. It is really special. So keep
your eyes open for it. Oh yeah, one last thing. To

112
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:09,045
keep up to date, I'm sure we'll talk more about
it, but you can visit geekandsundry.com/artbook to

113
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,295
sign up for email updates and book previews, so do
so.

114
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:20,037
TALIESIN: It should be available for ordering
sometime in the late fall.

115
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:23,907
ALL: Late fall!

116
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,541
MATT: Thank you guys very much.

117
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,947
LAURA: Yeah, thank you guys.

118
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:30,386
MATT: These two busted their ass on this book.

119
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:39,052
(cheering)

120
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:56,977
MATT: The other quick announcement we have: it's a
fun little thing that'll be tomorrow for those of

121
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:59,954
us at GenCon, and if it goes over well hopefully
at other events in future, but when we released

122
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:10,157
the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, the original design
of the cover was from a POV of Scanlan, and there

123
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:16,575
was some dissent in the community that Scanlan
wasn't in full display on the cover. So I

124
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:21,025
contacted Aaron Riley, the fantastic artist that
worked on our cover, and we got some vinyl decals

125
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:31,548
made so you can put one of two different pictures
of Scanlan on your cover of the book or any book

126
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,108
or art piece you find.

127
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:41,092
(cheering)

128
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:45,491
MATT: We're hoping to have those in tomorrow, for
those who can come to the signing, and even if you

129
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:48,716
didn't get a ticket for the signing, come to the
event anyway. We will have those available to pass

130
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:53,531
out, hopefully. So you can pick from the two, or
grab one of each, it's going to be ridiculous. One

131
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,386
of the particular images, I'm excited to see where
Scanlan shows up.

132
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:56,827
LAURA: They're really great.

133
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:57,970
MATT: It's absurd.

134
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,970
LIAM: Why's this small man on the Sistine Chapel?

135
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,600
(laughter)

136
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,545
MATT: That's why they're vinyl; you can remove
them without damaging property. I think. We'll

137
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:14,451
find out. Anyway, without further ado, I think
that brings us to the end of our announcements for

138
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:23,296
the evening, and as such, bring us into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

139
00:16:23,296 --> 00:17:51,963
[dramatic music]

140
00:17:51,963 --> 00:18:02,238
TRAVIS: Let's go!

141
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:05,524
MATT: All right, let's bring this down.

142
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:09,271
MARISHA: Holy shit.

143
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,472
LIAM: Vecna's Amish taint.

144
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:15,315
(laughter)

145
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:22,531
MATT: A little late, but thank you. I appreciate
that. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in their trek

146
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:28,354
to eventually hopefully seal and be rid of the
threat of Vecna, the Whispered One, in his

147
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:33,449
recently ascended godhood on the Prime Material
Plane, found themselves traversing below the

148
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:41,487
sub-ocean volcano, the Scaldseat, where they
managed to water-breathe their way through a jug.

149
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:52,773
They traversed the poisonous air within, and
coming upon the Allhammer's Core Anvil, on which

150
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:58,869
many artifacts of the Founding and beyond were
forged. There, you fought with the forge guardian,

151
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:04,255
who was left to see who has proven worthy to
utilize its components. You defeated it, and in

152
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:10,908
doing so, Percival, with the designs bestowed upon
you from Ioun, and Grog, with the bestowed-upon

153
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:16,512
knowledge of blacksmithing, took to the blacksmith
tools and together managed to forge, barely

154
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:25,188
successfully with a modicum of structural
integrity, the three Prime Trammels, hopefully

155
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:30,161
intended to destroy-- or at least seal off--
Vecna's influence on this plane.

156
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:38,781
The trammels now complete, each glowing with the
runes of each gifted deity power source. We have

157
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:43,579
one that glows yellow across its runic outside,
one that is a sky blue, and one that emanates a

158
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:47,976
black shadow from its runes, representing each
deity that bequeathed an element of their power

159
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:55,311
unto these trammels. You then decided to have
Scanlan drop his magnificent mansion and decide

160
00:19:55,311 --> 00:20:00,130
where your next journey was. As you all enter the
mansion, preparing for an evening's rest or

161
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,896
otherwise, we left off with you, now, away from
the heat of the volcano, plotting your next

162
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:07,520
directional path.

163
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,223
So Vox Machina, what do you want to do?

164
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,463
LIAM: That's a great question.

165
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,654
LAURA: Let me see those trammels. Who has the
trammels?

166
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:17,029
TRAVIS: I do. Why?

167
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,431
LAURA: I just want to look at them.

168
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,596
TRAVIS: All of them or just one?

169
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:21,036
LAURA: All of them.

170
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,724
TRAVIS: Fucking hell, shit. Here you go.

171
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:25,787
LAURA: That's it. I just want to hold them,
really.

172
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,643
TRAVIS: They're real big, right?

173
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:32,740
LAURA: Yeah, I'm cradling them, Grog.

174
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,236
MATT: Surprisingly, though, due to the platinum's
design, they're not as heavy as you expect them,

175
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,414
whether it'd be the enchantment or the material
that it was made from. They're still heavy for

176
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,302
you, Vex, because your strength is pretty shitty.

177
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:48,431
LAURA: Can I tell which one is which god?

178
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:53,158
MATT: Yes. The one that glows yellow, you feel a
slight bit of kinship with the blessing you

179
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:58,035
received from Pelor, the Dawnfather. The other
two, you can differentiate being the sky blue

180
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:02,473
color, probably with Ioun, the Knowing Mistress,
and the black probably representing the Raven

181
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:04,072
Queen.

182
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:07,876
LAURA: All right, cool, I'm going to hold on to
the Pelor one. Pass them back.

183
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,271
TRAVIS: I've got the other two?

184
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,639
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know if anybody else wants to
hold one.

185
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:16,082
TRAVIS: Just in case things go sour I also thought of
a nice way to use these, and I slide one between

186
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:27,755
each of my fingers, and I hold it up. (shink)
Okay, back in the Bag of Holding.

187
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,805
LIAM: Are you still embiggened right now?

188
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,782
TRAVIS: No, I haven't been biggened for a while.

189
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,782
LAURA: Yeah, he was only big fighting the
bulette.

190
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:45,322
TRAVIS: Oh, wait. By the way, I believe you said
that if I successfully did all of these trammels

191
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:53,183
that you had something for me. Thought I wouldn't
remember, did you?

192
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:57,854
(laughter)

193
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:05,123
LIAM: I did say that. It's rather personal,
though, I hope the rest of you can understand

194
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,762
that. I'm not going to be around for much longer,
so I wanted to say--

195
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,608
SAM: Do you want us to step out so you can have a
moment?

196
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,844
LIAM: No, we'll find a minute.

197
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:16,872
SAM: What? What does that mean?

198
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:22,283
LIAM: It's awkward; it's not something I'm
comfortable talking with--

199
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,218
LAURA: So you want us to leave?

200
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:30,508
LIAM: No! We can talk out a plan. Tonight before
we go to bed. It could be now; it could be later.

201
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:33,717
MARISHA: You've said too much about it now.

202
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:39,420
LIAM: I take Grog by the arm, and I usher him out
the door of the mansion.

203
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,854
TRAVIS: This is weird.

204
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,792
LAURA: Outside the mansion? You're out the mansion
now?

205
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:44,781
LIAM:Yeah.

206
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,423
SAM: You're going outside?

207
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,762
LIAM: Just out the front door.

208
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:49,938
SAM: Into the inside of the volcano?

209
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:51,148
LIAM: Is it on fire?

210
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,850
MATT: It's certainly very hot.

211
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,517
LIAM: Fuck it, Grog, let's go downstairs.

212
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:59,179
TRAVIS: War room!

213
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,789
MARISHA: He has 40 floors!

214
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,123
TRAVIS: We're going down to the war room, which is
a sand pit.

215
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,041
LIAM: Yeah, and I ignore all of the cat-calling
and all of the sniping and all of the shittiness.

216
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,522
These fucking assholes.

217
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:10,192
LAURA: Have fun, you two!

218
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:11,867
SAM: Use protection!

219
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:19,090
(laughter)

220
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,384
LIAM: That's what Grog is for!

221
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:27,227
MATT: The two of you descend the staircase into
the subterranean war room, where there you see

222
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:30,727
before you the giant sand pit that is currently
adorned with multiple training dummies with armor

223
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:36,169
and weapons. Strapped to them, magnificently
pristine, based on how many times you destroyed

224
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,454
and/or restructured the chamber, but there it lies
before you.

225
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:41,578
LIAM: Big man?

226
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:43,023
TRAVIS: Yeah? That's me.

227
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:54,366
LIAM: I'm not going to be around much longer,
probably, or you're not going to be around much

228
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,802
longer; one or the other.

229
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:56,784
TRAVIS: Yeah.

230
00:23:56,784 --> 00:24:11,214
LIAM: Yeah. Boy, I've been holding on to a thing
for a while now. Taryon, that scamp, gave me a

231
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:24,443
gift ages ago. He became a fan after I pranked his
ass at the beach. He caught the bug, and before we

232
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:29,063
said our goodbyes, he talked to me for a bit and
gave me something.

233
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,364
TRAVIS: You pranked his ass, and he caught the
bug?

234
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:44,559
(laughter)

235
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:55,139
LIAM: Right, I've got to talk simpler; sorry.
That's my mistake. Taryon gave me a very unique

236
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:58,253
item, and the purpose of it was to fuck with you.

237
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:11,399
(cheering)

238
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,194
LIAM: I could say "turducken" and you people would
turn it into sexual innuendo!

239
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:20,135
(cheering)

240
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,085
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is.

241
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:29,259
LIAM: Anyway, he wanted me to pull a prank on you,
and we have a lot of history with that, and I held

242
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:35,853
onto it for a long time, looking for a time that
felt right, and it never happened, and sometimes I

243
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:42,087
felt like I didn't want to do that anymore, but I
don't want to let his gift go to waste. And truth

244
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:50,256
be told, I did a bit of research on it. It is a
love potion, Grog.

245
00:25:50,256 --> 00:26:05,007
(gasping and cheering)

246
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:10,192
MATT: I forgot about that.
LIAM: Lasts about an hour.

247
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,985
(laughter)

248
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:18,062
LIAM: Lasts about an hour, and for a while, it was
really tempting, and I was looking for a moment

249
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:23,032
because that's you and me, that's history. But
then I did some research and it turns out that it

250
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:28,085
wouldn't have worked on you, anyway, because if
you want someone to fall in love with you, it has

251
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:36,315
to be on a person who you'd be interested in. And
to quote a very handsome dickhead we know, I'm

252
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,084
pretty sure you go taco, not hot dog.

253
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:54,686
(laughter)

254
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:57,222
LIAM: So I was right to assume then, yeah?

255
00:26:57,222 --> 00:27:00,056
TRAVIS: Yep. Taco.

256
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:09,015
LIAM: We're not all so limited, but that's your
thing; that's fine. I can't even use it on you,

257
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:22,144
but I've got it. And I'm going to miss you. I'll
be gone soon. I don't even know if we have time. A

258
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:28,244
lot of us could be dead soon, but I'm not offering
you this thing, but I'm offering you an

259
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:29,537
experience.

260
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:53,711
(cheering)

261
00:27:53,711 --> 00:28:02,994
TRAVIS: I don't know a lot of big words, but I
feel like I need a little bit of clarification.

262
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:15,168
LIAM: I don't know if we have time for this, but
maybe, for old time's sake, because I love you and

263
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:25,224
I know you love me and we share this in common. I
thought maybe we could prank Scanlan together.

264
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:44,694
(cheering)

265
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:49,298
LIAM: Because let's be honest, that guy would fuck
a turducken in front of him.

266
00:28:49,298 --> 00:29:01,923
TRAVIS: Just for the record, I had no doubts about
where that conversation was going. None. You have

267
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:07,608
a deal. I don't know how or when we are going to
pull this off, but if you don't make time--

268
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:11,345
LIAM: Yeah. It could be tonight.

269
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:13,320
TRAVIS: Fuck it. It's tonight.

270
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,704
(laughter)

271
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:29,430
LIAM: Here's what I don't have. I don't have a
plan.

272
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,118
TRAVIS: Nope, me neither. We never have those. So
listen, maybe while we're eating some of those

273
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:39,006
shitty salads that this fucking place makes now,
you can drizzle it on the top, or does he have to

274
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,474
drink it with a drink?

275
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:44,742
LIAM: I think he just needs to down it one way or
another. It could be mixed with something else; it

276
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,943
could be on its own.

277
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:49,301
TRAVIS: Who do we make him fall in love with?

278
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:53,994
LIAM: Well, originally I was thinking maybe we
could have a bet and see which one of us he falls

279
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,346
in love with.

280
00:29:55,346 --> 00:30:09,011
(laughter)

281
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:12,491
LIAM: And I know that's a shitty idea, but we have
to get up and--

282
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,993
TRAVIS: I fucking love it.

283
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:22,025
(laughter and cheering)

284
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:27,195
LIAM: So that means isolating the gnome away from
the others, because he could fall in love with

285
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:29,410
literally anything or anyone.

286
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,880
TRAVIS: Yeah, but look. The hunter does not go
after its prey in an isolated environment. The

287
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:42,555
hunter finds him in his natural habitat. Let him
roam free, I say.

288
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:52,148
(laughter)

289
00:30:52,198 --> 00:31:04,276
LIAM: I'm not sure I know what that means, but I
will carry this baton and follow your lead.

290
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:10,814
TRAVIS: Well, look. Before the rest of the group
starts wondering what we're doing in the war room,

291
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:16,295
let's go back up and whenever your sneaky ass
thinks it's appropriate you (drip) in his drink.

292
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:19,017
How about that?

293
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:27,473
LIAM: We'll call that Plan A. Plan B will be that
you grab his ass, and I just shove it in.

294
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:43,684
(laughter)

295
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:47,782
LIAM: Plan A, Plan B. You know those letters, you
know that far.

296
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:53,586
TRAVIS: I do. I know that part. And we head back
to the group.

297
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:57,975
SAM: Meanwhile, inside. I'm just so happy to be back in
the group.

298
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:03,439
(laughter)

299
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:07,959
SAM: It's been a pretty crazy few days but I feel
like you've all accepted me and I'm so happy to be

300
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:15,297
back. And I can't thank you enough, really, from
the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you for

301
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,223
fully accepting me back.

302
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:20,242
LAURA: We're really sorry for everything, Scanlan.
You know we love you.

303
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:24,476
SAM: I love you, too. Not in a weird way.

304
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:28,084
LAURA: No. I'm married.

305
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:31,716
SAM: Just friends.

306
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,981
LAURA: That would be awkward.

307
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:34,957
LIAM: Hey, what are you guys talking about?

308
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:38,323
SAM: Oh, just how much we love life.

309
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:44,179
MARISHA: How we're a happy family, you know?

310
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,630
LIAM: We are. We are close.

311
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,457
TRAVIS: (yells) Who wants a drink?

312
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:55,988
(laughter)

313
00:32:55,988 --> 00:33:04,755
SAM: That's a great idea, Grog. Invisible servants,
bring us the finest vegan wine.

314
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:10,066
MATT: As a procession of ghostly entities make
their way from the far-off kitchen on the basement

315
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:15,490
floor of Scanlan's magnificent mansion, they
procure a number of glass bottles containing wine.

316
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,709
It's just wine.

317
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:24,296
SAM: But no added animal fats.

318
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:32,448
MATT: You're not wrong. Goblets are placed across
the tables. Drinks are poured and you all have

319
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:37,141
within your grasp a fair nightcap, if you will,
before you find rest for the evening.

320
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:50,530
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Scanlan. Man. Great
teamwork today. Everyone, really.

321
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:58,333
LAURA: Yeah, seriously. I'm so amazed with both
you and Percy. You really pulled through, and we

322
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,875
would be lost without both of you.

323
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,995
LIAM: I start examining my fingernails and moving
closer to Scanlan.

324
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,531
(laughter)

325
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:18,674
MARISHA: I do feel like our teamwork has been
getting better, though. We've been doing so good.

326
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:20,858
Synergizing.

327
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:27,180
LAURA: Yeah, that fight could've gone terribly,
and we pulled through as a team.

328
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,531
MARISHA: Oh, a hundred percent.

329
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:38,326
SAM: You know what, though? I know in the past,
Vax, I've had my differences with you. I didn't

330
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:45,627
like you charging after that dragon that one time,
and we had some issues, but tonight I feel like

331
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:50,448
we're close and you would never do anything to
betray me.

332
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:57,584
LIAM: Oh, that wine looks really good.

333
00:34:57,584 --> 00:35:07,199
SAM: Let's take a sip. But first, I was thinking
about how close we've become, Vax, and I even

334
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,957
wrote you a little inspirational song.

335
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:17,093
(cheering)

336
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:20,828
LIAM: Here, let me hold your drink.

337
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:25,891
SAM: Okay, sure. You'll hold my drink while I
sing. This is just a song to show you how much you mean

338
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:37,939
to me and how close we've become over these years.
It's a long one. (rapping) Don't be tired, I'm

339
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:43,396
here to inspire. Before you blow out, let me light
your fire. I got no choir, just a gnome and a

340
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:46,205
lyre. So listen up to Burt Reynolds, esquire.

341
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:47,571
(rhythmic clapping)

342
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:54,208
SAM: Oh, that's going to fuck me up. (rapping)
You've got those moves like dagger! You're fast as

343
00:35:54,208 --> 00:36:01,988
a cat! You can attack five times-- I checked it
with Matt! You can't be killed, and one more

344
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:11,583
caveat: You get to sit next to the Poohbah de
Doink of All This and That!

345
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:17,229
So imagine a dark room, lit from above. Folks as
far as Czech Republic came to give you their love.

346
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:27,937
Your heart is beating like a goddamn drum. It's
singing, "I'm going back to Indiana, Indiana, here

347
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:37,289
"I come!" The tension is building, the roof's going
to blow. This ain't a rehearsal, it's the

348
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:43,277
motherfucking live show! Mic's rolling, camera's
on, dice rolling, Scanlan's song. No more

349
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:47,445
cajoling, this shit is on. This crowd is bigger
than my cube-like dong!

350
00:36:47,445 --> 00:37:00,077
(cheering)

351
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:05,193
SAM: You been down but what's it going to take to
give you some sack, man? How about 2,400 Critters

352
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:09,460
chanting, "Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan!"

353
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,297
(chanting)

354
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,507
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

355
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:33,708
LIAM: 29. That was inspiration to me?

356
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:40,676
MARISHA: He's inspiring you because he thinks
you're going to fucking fail.

357
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,726
LIAM: 39.

358
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:55,935
MATT: Scanlan, why don't you go ahead and make a
perception check?

359
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:59,794
SAM: That's a 12.

360
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:09,638
LIAM: I instantly dive and grab Keyleth's eyes and
cover them, and turn her away.

361
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:13,933
MARISHA: Stop. Get off of me!

362
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,089
LIAM: Sorry!

363
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:23,073
MARISHA: Why? Your hands are a little clammy. Oh
god! Why are you sweating? Why are you nervous?

364
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:24,796
You're nervous!

365
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:29,668
MATT: A very strange display from Vax'ildan.
However, your drink is available for you at the

366
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:30,487
table.

367
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:33,819
SAM: Yeah!

368
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:41,109
LAURA: That was a great song, Scanlan.

369
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,456
SAM: That's good stuff! Man, I just feel invigorated!

370
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:55,106
MATT: All right, so as you finish the drink, you
blink your eyes. I'm going to ask you, Scanlan,

371
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:59,573
who do you see first?

372
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:03,246
SAM: Let's see here, what do we got, six people
over here?

373
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:07,266
MATT: Well, you have two that have dove off to the
side.

374
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:21,647
SAM: Oh, okay. Then I'll roll a d4. One, two-- oh
wait, it's just three. It was a fucking four. Two!

375
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:22,922
Okay, Keyleth.

376
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:26,481
MATT: No, Keyleth is being shielded right now.

377
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:31,070
SAM: Oh shit! Well, then it's just Vex or Percy?
Or wait, are those two, too?

378
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:36,359
MATT: The other people in the room right now are
Percival, Vex, or Grog.

379
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,363
SAM: Okay, well, then it would be Grog. Do I have
three choices or four?

380
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,426
LAURA: You have four choices!

381
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:50,701
SAM: Four choices! All right, and could you raise
your hand if you're one of my choices? Okay. One,

382
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,788
two, three, four.

383
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:54,121
It's Percy.

384
00:39:54,121 --> 00:40:08,249
(cheering)

385
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:16,375
MATT: So here's my question, Scanlan. First and
foremost, let me pull up. Is there a saving throw?

386
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,706
LIAM: Philter of Love.

387
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,713
MATT: Right.

388
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:24,526
LIAM: I can recite it for you, if you like. The
next time you see a creature within ten minutes

389
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:29,461
after drinking this philter, you become charmed by
the creature for one hour. If the creature is of a

390
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:36,270
species and gender you are normally attracted to--
turducken-- you regard it as your true love while

391
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,093
you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued
effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss

392
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:44,163
bubble shaped like a heart.

393
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:45,632
MATT: How long does it last?

394
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:47,500
LIAM: One hour.

395
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,220
MATT: All right. And I guess my question to you,
Scanlan, is based on your journeys and travels

396
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,897
across the lands of Tal'Dorei and beyond, how
adventurous have you been in your various

397
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:58,697
exploits?

398
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:13,446
SAM: A human man? That was teenage years, baby.
I've gone much further than that since then.

399
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:21,394
MATT: Then as you glance up into the beautiful
eyes of the white-haired Master of Whitestone, his

400
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:26,917
white locks gently curling at the tips from an
afternoon of sweating amongst the heat of the

401
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:32,893
volcano, his fingers gingerly caressing the
outside of the goblet in which he's enjoyed his

402
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:54,092
own wine. You find yourself impossibly attracted
to your once ally, now direction of your

403
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:56,325
affection.

404
00:41:56,325 --> 00:42:06,520
SAM: I don't know. I don't know if it's the wine
talking, but oh man. I feel something I've never

405
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,488
felt before, Percival.

406
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:12,025
TALIESIN: That sounds like the wine talking.

407
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:39,079
SAM: I've never seen you in this light before.
Your eyebrows. I want to lick them. They seem soft.

408
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,982
LAURA: You want to what?!

409
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:50,218
SAM: That came out wrong. What I meant was, what
are you doing later?

410
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:59,540
LAURA: I walk up and I palm Scanlan's forehead and
slam him to the ground. What the fuck are you

411
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,432
doing?

412
00:43:00,432 --> 00:43:04,178
SAM: I'm sorry! It's just, well, you've seen it.

413
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:23,465
(laughter)

414
00:43:23,465 --> 00:43:24,682
MATT: Continue.

415
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:32,554
SAM: The way he looks at you and everything stops.
The way all sound fades away when he's talking.

416
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:36,211
MARISHA: No, that's his Silence spell that he got
recently.

417
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:52,421
SAM: The way he <i>cocks</i> his gun. (groans) Holds it
so firmly. It trembles just a little but then

418
00:43:52,421 --> 00:44:07,334
<i>bang</i>. (moans) Just a gentle touch is all it
takes.

419
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:13,131
TALIESIN: Would this be an insight check, at this
point?

420
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:16,075
MATT: Yes.

421
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:18,822
TRAVIS: Please.

422
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,327
TALIESIN: Oh no.

423
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:24,688
TRAVIS: No, it's not! Is it really?

424
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:29,887
LAURA: I'm going to feel his forehead. Does he
feel warm?

425
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:33,069
TALIESIN: How long have you felt this way? This is
a bit--

426
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:47,611
SAM: It feels like forever. (singing) One song,
glory. One song to win your heart, glory. Where do

427
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:49,770
I even start?

428
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,762
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening right
now.

429
00:44:51,762 --> 00:44:54,808
SAM: (singing) One song from the pretty boy
gnome.

430
00:44:54,808 --> 00:45:00,578
TRAVIS: We fucked up. Oh man.

431
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:05,932
LAURA: Scanlan, I don't blame you. I don't. This
seems to be coming out of nowhere, and he's

432
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:17,242
married to me, and I will cut you!

433
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:26,449
SAM: Love knoweth no boundaries, and even though
there's a significant age difference between us--

434
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,524
LAURA: How much of an age difference?

435
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:32,097
SAM: I'm not at liberty to say.

436
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,992
(laughter)

437
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:47,344
SAM: Why does marriage need to be so constricting,
man? I mean, can't we be free in this crazy

438
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,349
mixed-up world?

439
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:59,846
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend that I'm not
extremely flattered by this, and I am, but I don't know.

440
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:03,753
SAM: I want to see you naked.

441
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:12,409
MARISHA: Scanlan, are you experiencing a bit of
cotton mouth? Maybe?

442
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:14,123
SAM: (smacking) Yes.

443
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:15,588
MARISHA: Are your pupils a little dilated?

444
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:16,694
SAM: The lights.

445
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:18,344
LAURA: I'm going to look into his eyes. Are his
eyes dilated?

446
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:24,694
MARISHA: I turn to Vax. What did you do?

447
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:28,790
TALIESIN: Is it that hard to believe that maybe
someone finds me attractive?

448
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:42,248
(cheering)

449
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:47,630
LIAM: Guys, this is all besides the point. We have
a god to kill. What are we going to do about the god?

450
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,887
SAM: Yes. No, we should talk. We should
strategize.

451
00:46:52,887 --> 00:47:16,824
(laughter and cheering)

452
00:47:16,824 --> 00:47:24,049
LIAM: I want to step outside the game for a second
to say that Sam Riegel gave me a bullet to kill

453
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:29,654
Travis Willingham with, and I have turned the gun
back on Sam Riegel.

454
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:39,326
(cheering)

455
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:46,215
LIAM: And shortly, it will be my time to die.

456
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:53,150
MATT: After this unique and unexpected display of
overt affection, you find yourself sitting around

457
00:47:53,150 --> 00:48:01,566
a table amongst the mansion to discuss over your
wine and confusion what plan of action to take

458
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:04,998
next in your journey to take down the Whispered
One, the Undying King.

459
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:11,550
LAURA: I'm going to sit directly between Percy and
Scanlan for all of this conversation.

460
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:21,799
TRAVIS: So we rest and then we go hunting? Or do
we try and rally allies?

461
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:35,810
SAM: I cast Mage Hand to tickle Percy's knee.

462
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:42,600
LAURA: I have a 23 passive perception, Scanlan.

463
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,688
MATT: Scanlan, make a sleight of hand check.

464
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:49,219
SAM: 20.

465
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,701
LAURA: What?

466
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:57,084
MATT: Yeah, you see him starting to make his
fingers over towards your boy.

467
00:48:57,084 --> 00:49:04,636
LAURA: I grab his fingers and start to bend them
backwards. I whisper in his ear: do you want to

468
00:49:04,636 --> 00:49:08,021
keep playing your fucking lute or not?

469
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:09,989
SAM: I'd prefer it if Percy did.

470
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:21,665
(laughter)

471
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:26,320
LAURA: Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?
How long have you felt this way? Because this is

472
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,655
very fucking strange, Scanlan.

473
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:34,687
SAM: I don't know. It was love at first sight, but
now, so not first. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll try

474
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:46,586
to keep it together. I'll think of gross things.
Victor's ball sack. Ugh.

475
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:56,664
MATT: "Learn from my mistakes."

476
00:49:56,664 --> 00:50:08,455
SAM: Why are they so singed? All right. Okay,
let's focus up. Okay. Go on, strategize.

477
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:14,380
LIAM: Time! We don't have a lot of time. So what
are we going to do with it? Are we going to get

478
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,530
allies? Are we going to talk to Allura again?
Gilmore?

479
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:23,053
TRAVIS: Ooh, wait. First things first, do we know
where he is? Don't you have the ability to like--

480
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,680
LAURA: Oh yeah. Is he still in the same place?

481
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,641
LIAM: I don't know in here; I need to shove my
head out the door for a sec.

482
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:30,423
LAURA: Well, shove your head out the door.

483
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:37,626
MATT: All right. As you emerge into the heated air
of the sub-ocean volcano, you take a moment and

484
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:42,723
concentrate and you can sense the direction and
distance seems to be approximately the same.

485
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,785
LAURA: He hasn't moved at all?

486
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:48,071
MATT: Make a perception check, I guess.

487
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:53,334
LIAM: 24.

488
00:50:53,334 --> 00:51:01,118
MATT: 24. You take about five minutes or so to
concentrate, and while the distance and direction

489
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:06,263
is relatively the same, there is very faint
movement.

490
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:13,611
LIAM: Am I able to feel gradual coming towards
where we are, away, anything like that?

491
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:24,373
MATT: From where you are currently, which is in
the volcano, it seems to be east and south of its

492
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,952
previous location.

493
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:28,017
LAURA: Where would that move him towards?

494
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:29,407
MARISHA: Towards Vasselheim.

495
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:33,842
LAURA: Solid.

496
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:38,366
TALIESIN: We should maybe go to Vasselheim in the
morning, start to rally.

497
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:45,043
LAURA: Yeah. Do Allura and Gilmore and Kima and
everyone, do they know what's going on? Have we

498
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:46,338
sent word?

499
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,205
TALIESIN: Well, we've sent some word out to the
world.

500
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:52,708
LIAM: We've sent messages to Tary and to who else?
There were two messages sent.

501
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,162
MARISHA: Tary, the Ashari.

502
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:55,708
SAM: Kaylie. I think.

503
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,531
TALIESIN: We activated the beacons.

504
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:03,793
MARISHA: We activated the Chaos Orbs. Crisis Orbs.
I always mess them up.

505
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:05,831
TRAVIS: So we should rest and head to Vasselheim?

506
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,880
TALIESIN: We're not any good to anybody at the
moment, so I imagine so.

507
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:20,384
LIAM: I think we'll all feel better after a
night's sleep. Yeah.

508
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:23,979
TRAVIS: Scanlan, where are you sleeping tonight?

509
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:26,637
SAM: In my room.

510
00:52:26,637 --> 00:52:31,596
TRAVIS: Do we need to post guards outside?

511
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:35,690
SAM: I have all the guards I need. Don't worry,
I'll be safe.

512
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,284
MARISHA: We're not worried about you.

513
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,487
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

514
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:43,450
LAURA: It'll be fine!

515
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,170
TRAVIS: (laughs) It'll be great.

516
00:52:47,170 --> 00:53:02,052
SAM: So we're going to sleep and then to
Vasselheim?

517
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:04,218
TRAVIS: We rest and then we go.

518
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:07,387
TALIESIN: That's the plan.

519
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,286
LAURA: Yeah.

520
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,557
SAM: Okay, let's do it.

521
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,789
MATT: All right. Finishing your wine, you all
scatter to your various rooms throughout the

522
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:17,801
mansion, prepare yourselves for an evening's rest.
In the morning, journey to the cradle of

523
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:20,216
civilization, Vasselheim.

524
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:27,334
TALIESIN: I do set a bucket trap at the door just
in case. I set a bucket trap.

525
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:34,443
LIAM: As everybody's trundling up the stairs, I
catch Grog alone for a second and say: let this

526
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:44,217
stand as a testament to how much I love you. I'm
sorry that I shaved your beard.

527
00:53:44,217 --> 00:53:51,082
TRAVIS: Thank you. I don't have to kill you now.

528
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:58,304
(applause)

529
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:15,507
LIAM: Give him a little pinch on the cheek. Oh,
Grog, you couldn't if you tried. Now. Good night,

530
00:54:15,507 --> 00:54:16,548
big guy.

531
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:18,249
TRAVIS: 'Night.

532
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:22,178
MATT: All right. You all find yourselves in your
chambers. Anything else you wish to do before the

533
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:23,593
evening comes to a close?

534
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:35,436
SAM: Yes. Sorry, Matt. I know we're trying to get
to other things, but magic compels me to put on my

535
00:54:35,436 --> 00:54:44,515
best silk g-string, and it compels me to use the
series of tunnels that interconnect all of the rooms.

536
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:46,534
TALIESIN: Oh shit! No!

537
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:58,067
SAM: That only I know about. And it compels me to
sneak into Percival's room in the dead of night

538
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:59,827
and crawl into bed with him.

539
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:04,428
LAURA: I'm in the bed, you motherfucker!

540
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:06,065
SAM: Are you in there?!

541
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:08,703
LAURA: We're married!

542
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:12,732
SAM: I thought it was like the 50s, where you had
two twin beds.

543
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:17,616
MATT: Have you seen their gold pile?

544
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:24,166
SAM: Then I guess I better be extra stealthy.

545
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:27,184
MATT: Make a stealth check.

546
00:55:27,184 --> 00:55:29,370
SAM: Okay. I think that's going to work. Eight.

547
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:37,909
(laughter)

548
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:42,642
MATT: With a slight jostle, Vex'ahlia and
Percival, you both pop one eye open and glance

549
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:49,535
over as what you thought at first might be a small
child crawling into your bed, scared of a midnight

550
00:55:49,535 --> 00:56:00,944
storm, instead find a magnificent, silk-adorned,
familiar gnome trying to wedge himself between

551
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:06,066
your bodies, which is impressive, based on the
spooning position you're already in.

552
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:08,537
SAM: Let it happen.

553
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:21,364
TALIESIN: I reach underneath my pillow. I grab a
small copper ball. Manners.

554
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:29,699
(cheering)

555
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:32,722
MATT: All right. And that's a strength ability
check?

556
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,785
TALIESIN: That's a strength check, I believe.

557
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:35,840
SAM: Just a check?

558
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,538
MATT: Is it a check or saving throw? That's the
distinction now.

559
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:40,311
TALIESIN: Where is it? It's a check, not a saving
throw.

560
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:42,964
SAM: Ten.

561
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:44,474
TALIESIN: No.

562
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:49,002
MATT: With a rapid series of clicks, whirrs and
grinding of metal, you watch as a metallic

563
00:56:49,002 --> 00:56:54,255
exoskeleton unwinds from the sphere, (clicking)
wraps itself around your body. You find yourself

564
00:56:54,255 --> 00:57:00,124
suddenly bound and held in place, unable to shift,
as these cold metal bars wrap around you like an

565
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:01,694
exoskeleton.

566
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:06,403
LAURA: Scanlan Shorthalt, tell me now why I
shouldn't feed you to Trinket.

567
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:11,634
TALIESIN: I undo the lock so he can talk.

568
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:24,994
SAM: I'm sorry! I don't know what's happening to
me. I know that this is your marital bed. Can I at

569
00:57:24,994 --> 00:57:36,275
least watch? I promise I won't look at you, Vex. I
won't look at you at all! I'll just be looking at

570
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:37,277
Percy.

571
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:43,658
LAURA: Would we know that something is wrong?

572
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:47,050
TALIESIN: I rolled a one. I don't know anything's
wrong.

573
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,537
MATT: Make an insight check on this.

574
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,858
LAURA: What am I making? Insight. Okay.

575
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:57,811
MATT: Now that you're up close and definitely
discerning his behavior.

576
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,074
LAURA: Fucking A.

577
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,249
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

578
00:58:00,249 --> 00:58:07,068
LAURA: It's a 12, but I rolled a three.

579
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:13,670
MATT: You get the sense that something's off and
different, but you think it may be a practical

580
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,764
joke or he's just trying to fuck with you.

581
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:22,807
LAURA: All I have is Lesser Restoration. Unless
you're fucking with me, I'm going to try Lesser

582
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:23,830
Restoration.

583
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:33,820
TALIESIN: Or we could go to his room and defile
his room. God only knows what's happened there.

584
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,275
LAURA: Here's the thing, darling. If something is
wrong with him, and this is so out of character

585
00:58:38,275 --> 00:58:42,107
I'm afraid something is wrong with him-- not that
you're not completely desirable--

586
00:58:42,107 --> 00:58:44,031
TALIESIN: That's all I needed to hear; go on.

587
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:50,720
LAURA: But he needs a good night's sleep and I'm
afraid he won't get it in this.

588
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,902
TALIESIN: All right.

589
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:58,260
LAURA: I'm going to try Lesser Restoration on him.
I'm not sure if it'll work.

590
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,265
TALIESIN: In case this is magical, I just want to leave
you with something.

591
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:12,046
(laughter)

592
00:59:12,046 --> 00:59:14,867
LAURA: In case it's not, don't do that anymore.

593
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:20,654
MATT: All right. You extend your hand. You
complete the incantation under your breath and

594
00:59:20,654 --> 00:59:24,365
begrudgingly administer a Lesser Restoration spell
onto his body. You watch as his gnomish form

595
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:31,905
suddenly flashes with a brief burst of divine
energy, and as it subsides, his eyes blink and

596
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:39,107
stare back to Percival with the same longing lust
that he had when he entered the room.

597
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:47,037
LAURA: Well, fuck. I got nothing. Scanlan!
Seriously, this is not acceptable. Go to bed! If

598
00:59:47,037 --> 00:59:50,038
we let you out of this cage, will you go to bed?

599
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:52,645
SAM: (muffled agreement)

600
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:59,895
LAURA: I'm going to send Trinket to your room with
you, and he's going to sleep on top of you so that

601
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:01,765
you will go to sleep.

602
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,830
SAM: (muffled agreement)

603
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,217
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

604
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:08,118
TALIESIN: Manners. (click)

605
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:12,317
MATT: All right. It unlatches itself and reforms
into the iron ball that you carry at your side.

606
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:17,721
Scanlan, as you fall the ground, clasping the floor
with your hands and knees, breathing heavily,

607
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:23,235
still the warmth subsiding from the slight touch
that you received at Percival's fingertips. Based

608
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:28,404
on the time you spent drinking, conversing,
scattering to your rooms, getting dressed and

609
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:32,598
making sure you were properly prepared for this
endeavor, making your way through the tunnels

610
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:43,035
stealthing in at this moment, it's right about now
that the phial wears off.

611
01:00:43,035 --> 01:01:06,090
SAM: Ha ha! Just a birthday prank. Is it your
birthday?

612
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,956
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

613
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:25,292
SAM: Oh, got the date wrong. (retching) I need to
change. I have jizzed in my pants.

614
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:37,279
(laughter)

615
01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:39,081
SAM: I'm sorry.

616
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:41,103
TALIESIN: Too much information. Thank you.

617
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:43,435
SAM: Have a good evening.

618
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:48,041
TALIESIN: Good evening. Do you walk out the main
door?

619
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,306
SAM: The main door.

620
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:51,812
TALIESIN: Okay, so you do in fact trigger a
bucket.

621
01:01:51,812 --> 01:02:04,485
(laughter)

622
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:08,092
TALIESIN: With a viscous powder that I mixed up.
It's basically a flour base. It's going to be a

623
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,116
real pain to wash off.

624
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:14,707
MATT: You're a ghost-white, bucket-headed gnome in
a silk g-string.

625
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:20,574
LAURA: Why? Why did you do it?

626
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:23,339
SAM: For the lulz?

627
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:29,552
(laughter)

628
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:42,783
SAM: I don't know. I'll see you in the morning.

629
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:49,323
TALIESIN: I'm going to block the secret passage.
I'm going to shift some furniture.

630
01:02:49,323 --> 01:02:56,354
LIAM: By the way, when everyone asks me tomorrow
on social media why I did it, same answer.

631
01:02:56,354 --> 01:02:59,035
TALIESIN: This was good. Well done, you.

632
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:05,786
MATT: After some disconcerting conversation
between the married couple and a shameful walk

633
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:10,341
back to your own chambers, you eventually find
yourself coming to rest for the evening. After a

634
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:16,498
full night's sleep, you find yourself with your
spells restored, your hit points restored, half

635
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:25,583
your hit dice restored, and an embarrassing
morning breakfast before you. As you all come down

636
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:31,633
to a fine vegan breakfast meal there on the table,
you all have conversation, start plotting and

637
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:36,030
planning, and you hear the gentle footsteps of one
slowly approaching Scanlan to the breakfast

638
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,209
table.

639
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:38,920
LAURA: Oh, hey.

640
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:50,109
SAM: (husky) Hey. (clears throat) Didn't sleep a
lot. Sorry. Hey, Percy.

641
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:55,694
TALIESIN: Hi.

642
01:03:55,694 --> 01:04:09,111
MARISHA: What distributor do you get your wine
from? Just curious.

643
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:14,514
SAM: I don't want to talk about it.

644
01:04:14,514 --> 01:04:17,097
LAURA: So, Vasselheim?

645
01:04:17,097 --> 01:04:18,200
TALIESIN: Yep.

646
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:28,583
MATT: All right, so finishing your meals. What do
you guys want to do? You're going to Vasselheim.

647
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,808
How are you doing that?

648
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:36,678
MARISHA: Okay. Do we have a plan before we get
there? Before I teleport us into the middle of a

649
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:39,317
city that might possibly be in the middle of a war
zone?

650
01:04:39,317 --> 01:04:43,365
LIAM: Why don't I go see how much progress he's
made? And I stick my skull out the door again and

651
01:04:43,365 --> 01:04:45,303
see how far he's gotten.

652
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:48,308
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

653
01:04:48,308 --> 01:04:51,488
LIAM: Very good. 30.

654
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:58,646
MATT: Okay. Listening to your senses and focusing
on the direction, still traveling. Still

655
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:05,939
relatively slow pace, as far as the general
distance, but it's making headway. It's traveled

656
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:08,274
throughout the night a number of miles.

657
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:13,159
TALIESIN: We should at least prepare Vasselheim,
then.

658
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:18,079
TRAVIS: Yeah. He hasn't obviously gotten there,
right?

659
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,945
TALIESIN: If a wrath of a dark god is on its way,
they should probably prepare themselves.

660
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:24,403
MARISHA: Also, I'm assuming he's traveling with an
army.

661
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:28,746
TALIESIN: We would assume. With one eye each.

662
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:35,423
LAURA: Oh god. What if Vasselheim is a show of
power?

663
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:39,470
TALIESIN: That would be likely.

664
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,169
SAM: Let's hurry.

665
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:44,918
TRAVIS: Where to in Vasselheim?

666
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:50,215
MARISHA: How long would it take us to get out? Oh,
wait. We chartered that boat; do we care about

667
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:53,584
those people?

668
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:56,500
TALIESIN: Wow.

669
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,292
MARISHA: Or are we just going to leave them in the
middle of the ocean?

670
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:02,317
LAURA: They were only going to wait for us a
couple of days, and then they were going to head back.

671
01:06:02,317 --> 01:06:04,481
LIAM: Yeah, they would assume we drowned.

672
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:07,888
MARISHA: Okay, fair argument.

673
01:06:07,888 --> 01:06:12,596
MATT: Yeah, you gather that probably when they
drove a bunch of yahoos out in the middle of the

674
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:17,065
ocean to dive under a volcano in the ocean that
they did not expect you to return.

675
01:06:17,065 --> 01:06:23,485
MARISHA: We did put a 500 gold holding deposit on,
an incidental that we will not get back.

676
01:06:23,485 --> 01:06:28,275
LAURA: I think the destruction of the world may be
more important than 500 gold.

677
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:31,244
(shocked noises)

678
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:33,419
LAURA: I know.

679
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:38,012
SAM: Quick, cast Lesser Restoration on yourself!

680
01:06:38,012 --> 01:06:46,476
MARISHA: It would probably take us a while to get
up and out to a tree, right? I'm being a little

681
01:06:46,476 --> 01:06:49,025
selfish with my upper-level spells.

682
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:50,328
TALIESIN: No, I feel it.

683
01:06:50,328 --> 01:06:56,398
TRAVIS: Up and out to it. Up the volcano, up the
water--

684
01:06:56,398 --> 01:07:00,370
MARISHA: Okay, you know what? Don't worry about
it, let's go. Let's just Plane Shift.

685
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,937
MATT: That's an arduous journey back to any
possible tree.

686
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:05,093
TRAVIS: Wanted to talk that one out.

687
01:07:05,093 --> 01:07:08,395
MARISHA: Yeah. I Plane Shift us to Vasselheim.

688
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:13,648
MATT: All right, so you Plane Shift to Vasselheim.
As you guys encircle your hands once more,

689
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:15,848
Keyleth, you focus on whereabouts in Vasselheim?

690
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:17,117
TRAVIS: The Trial Forge?

691
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:22,284
LAURA: Or Melora's tree maybe?

692
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:39,651
(laughter and applause)

693
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,616
SAM: Residual magic.

694
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:47,949
TRAVIS, SAM, and TALIESIN: Trial Forge?

695
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:50,558
MARISHA: Where will you not get arrested?

696
01:07:50,558 --> 01:08:00,501
TRAVIS: No one's going to even notice me. Yeah,
they were ringing the bells and running around and

697
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:08,248
getting prepared and stuff. Yeah, and if for some
reason, somebody's like, "That guy punched me in

698
01:08:08,248 --> 01:08:10,995
"the face," we'll just punch them.

699
01:08:10,995 --> 01:08:15,046
TALIESIN: I agree with this plan.

700
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:16,279
MARISHA: Trial Forge.

701
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:22,858
MATT: All right. With that, you close your eyes.
Beneath your breath, you recite the incantation.

702
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:29,509
With that, you feel your body suddenly sucked into
a dark void and thrust through the absence of

703
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:34,794
space. And within a moment's time, before you can
adjust to the sudden cold and dark vacuous void

704
01:08:34,794 --> 01:08:41,185
around you, your feet hit hard ground, your eyes
focus again to the light, and you glance around

705
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:50,136
and the center streets, not actually directly at
the Trial Forge-- ooh, we got music, finally. In

706
01:08:50,136 --> 01:08:55,598
the streets around the Braving Grounds, you can
see the smokestacks from the Trial Forge over the

707
01:08:55,598 --> 01:09:06,278
distance. You also notice that the sky above you
is deep, dark gray clouds. It's as if there is a

708
01:09:06,278 --> 01:09:11,427
perpetual eclipse placed upon this ground. You
look around in all directions, and you see this

709
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:19,452
roiling gray cloud cluster that encompasses the
entirety of the sky above you, which should be

710
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:27,640
mid-morning or midday. It's blotted out by the
storm-- rainfall is absent-- and you see flashes

711
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:34,146
of light, occasionally framing strange shapes
and clouds. Whether by illusion or by a trick of

712
01:09:34,146 --> 01:09:43,548
your mind, you swear you see shifting darkness and
forms, images in the clouds: giant faces silently

713
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:51,266
screaming, hundreds of feet across, that extend and
push out of the clouds and draw back into the sky.

714
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:57,208
Massive hands that push against them, only to
slowly recede moments later. You blink and they're

715
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:01,487
gone, leaving you unsettled regardless and
uncertain as to whether or not that was just you

716
01:10:01,487 --> 01:10:04,512
or if everyone can see this.

717
01:10:04,512 --> 01:10:09,617
As your focus shifts from the sky above, you look
around and you can see Bastions are stationed all

718
01:10:09,617 --> 01:10:16,186
across the perimeter walls of Vasselheim. You see
large ballistae mounted and armed as watchers

719
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:21,628
scour the distant horizon on all sides looking for
any sign of something in the distance making its

720
01:10:21,628 --> 01:10:27,175
way towards the city, based on the warning you
previously gave. Unlit beacons sit at every major

721
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:32,029
structure and juncture of the stone walls,
awaiting the burning sign that an assault is

722
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:39,078
spotted. Militia and armored guard move with haste
to stations across the city quarters. You can feel

723
01:10:39,078 --> 01:10:42,932
the air of war permeating the streets.

724
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:47,647
The streets are far emptier than you recall, the
stragglers returning to their homes with carts

725
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:55,513
full of rations, produce, and weapons. Fear grips
their face as they pass by. You glance off to your

726
01:10:55,513 --> 01:11:01,378
left, and you can see a wiry old man in the
corner, his tangled silver and blond hair

727
01:11:01,378 --> 01:11:07,881
bouncing with fervor, as he shouts out, "The
reckoning of our opulence has come! The gods are

728
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:13,098
"away and the price of our hubris comes to consume
us." But no one's paying him mind. His tattered

729
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:18,373
bones jangling his knees across each other, as he
makes his way through the streets, his face a

730
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:21,215
glance of utter despair.

731
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:27,408
You notice an argument between two Bastions and a
middle-aged bearded man who is painting a familiar

732
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:31,946
symbol on his front door, not too far from where
you stand. A five-year-old girl cries and clings

733
01:11:31,946 --> 01:11:35,886
to his leg. What do you do?

734
01:11:35,886 --> 01:11:38,835
TALIESIN: What is the symbol?

735
01:11:38,835 --> 01:11:41,271
MATT: Make a perception check.

736
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:45,719
TALIESIN: I'll make a perception check. Let's see
if you'll roll a one again. No, that's much

737
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:49,702
better. 28.

738
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:57,479
MATT: Glancing at this distance, you see a
familiar and striking shape. It is a haphazardly

739
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:05,531
drawn circle with dark, reddish purple paint and
a small line and a pronged fork of four prongs

740
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:08,005
painted up against this wall.

741
01:12:08,005 --> 01:12:09,545
MARISHA: Oh, hell no.

742
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:12,253
LAURA: He's painting it on the door? The guy in
the city is?

743
01:12:12,253 --> 01:12:14,554
MATT: The father figure.

744
01:12:14,554 --> 01:12:17,049
LIAM: Yeah. It could be to pass over their house.

745
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:18,045
TALIESIN: Yes.

746
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:19,918
MARISHA: Pass over?

747
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:21,884
LAURA: That's the Vecna symbol, right?

748
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:27,727
MATT: Sensing the distance of Vecna, he's still
far to the northwest of here. But what was once a

749
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:38,432
few hundred miles is now shortened, about two
hundred or so, and getting lesser and lesser.

750
01:12:38,432 --> 01:12:41,067
LAURA: Fuck. Should we go up and talk to that
guy?

751
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:45,303
MARISHA: Maybe one of us. Maybe not all of us.

752
01:12:45,303 --> 01:12:46,423
LAURA: You there.

753
01:12:46,423 --> 01:12:52,410
MATT: As you make the shout, you see the soldiers
are currently arguing with him. One says, "You

754
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,746
"welcome this rubbish? Are you one of them kook
believers?"

755
01:12:55,746 --> 01:13:02,283
And the father is angrily staring in his face and
says, "You mind your business. I have no love for

756
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:05,121
"this, but if these dreams are true, I must protect
my family."

757
01:13:05,121 --> 01:13:06,887
LAURA: Dreams?

758
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:08,999
MATT: They turn and look at you as you approach.

759
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:10,961
LAURA: What dreams?

760
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:15,430
MATT: The soldiers take a step back with a look of
recognition across you as you step forward with

761
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:22,319
your white dragon scale armor. They know not to
approach and there is seemingly a sense of knowing

762
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,539
who you are, at least from the legends that are
told amongst the streets of Vasselheim. The father

763
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:35,676
turns to you and seeing your lordly approach, and
strong voice, immediately. "The nightmares I've

764
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:47,317
"had, and I'm not the first. This symbol. It scares
me, but if something comes like they say it is, I

765
01:13:47,317 --> 01:13:51,896
"must it let it know we have no quarrel. To
leave my family be."

766
01:13:51,896 --> 01:13:54,603
LAURA: This symbol will not protect you.

767
01:13:54,603 --> 01:13:55,944
MATT: "How do you know this?"

768
01:13:55,944 --> 01:14:04,302
LAURA: Because I know his followers. They won't
have mercy. They'll gouge out eyes, remove your

769
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:07,277
hand, and make you one of them.

770
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,109
MATT: Make a persuasion check, please.

771
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:19,465
LAURA: Okay. Hold on. 17?

772
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:29,018
MATT: Okay, he looks at you for a moment, his eyes
keen with fear, and his face. "You're certain of

773
01:14:29,018 --> 01:14:30,327
"this, my lady?"

774
01:14:30,327 --> 01:14:32,106
LAURA: Yes.

775
01:14:32,106 --> 01:14:35,545
MATT: "Will you protect us, then?"

776
01:14:35,545 --> 01:14:39,165
LAURA: We'll do our best. That's what we're here
for.

777
01:14:39,165 --> 01:14:45,054
MATT: He looks past you, the rest of your
companions, all looking well-armed and definitely

778
01:14:45,054 --> 01:14:52,963
capable. Looks down and rubs the hair of his
little girl, her sandy blonde hair curled up and a

779
01:14:52,963 --> 01:15:02,355
bit dirtied. Looking down from her gaze, up to
you, he says, "Then I trust you." He takes the

780
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:06,139
tattered paintbrush he was using and smears across
the symbol, destroying it.

781
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:16,248
(applause)

782
01:15:16,248 --> 01:15:18,895
LAURA: Dear god, I hope that works.

783
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:28,675
MATT: He goes inside with his daughter. Before he
closes the door: "Thank you. Please, help." Pulls

784
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:31,495
the rest of the cart in and closes the door behind
with a slam.

785
01:15:31,495 --> 01:15:37,834
The two guards awkwardly look at each other and
back to you. "Thank you."

786
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:50,745
(laughter)

787
01:15:50,745 --> 01:15:53,806
MATT: "Be safe." And they both wander off.

788
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:56,676
LAURA: I don't think they noticed you, Grog.

789
01:15:56,676 --> 01:15:59,035
TRAVIS: Man, I'm fucking slick.

790
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:06,723
MATT: Knowing the location, you're not that far
from the Quadroads juncture between the different

791
01:16:06,723 --> 01:16:12,194
areas. You can go further towards the Trial Forge
or back towards the center of where the Quadroads

792
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:17,180
meets between that and where the Platinum
Sanctuary and Platinum Dragon section is. There is

793
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:23,950
the temple to Sarenrae, where you left Pike
previously. What do you wish to do?

794
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:27,734
MARISHA: Is the crazy zealot still running
around?

795
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:32,211
MATT: Yeah. He seems to be scattered through the
streets. He's maybe 60 feet away, still shouting

796
01:16:32,211 --> 01:16:35,608
obscenities and weird doom-saying prophecies.

797
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:37,627
MARISHA: I walk up to him.

798
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:45,359
MATT: Okay. As he's shouting this time, "He will
come! He will destroy us! You! He will destroy

799
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,589
"you, too! I've seen it! I've seen it."

800
01:16:48,589 --> 01:16:51,942
MARISHA: Yeah. I believe you. I've seen it, too.

801
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:56,917
MATT: "Good! Then save yourself! Run! Run far!"

802
01:16:56,917 --> 01:17:00,487
MARISHA: Wait. How did he talk to you?

803
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:09,062
MATT: "In my mind. In my dreams. He comes. He says
it's inevitable. The clouds, they come as the

804
01:17:09,062 --> 01:17:13,628
"first warning. The first seal broken. The sky has
already left us. The sun is gone!"

805
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:20,672
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, no. Accurate.

806
01:17:20,672 --> 01:17:33,416
MATT: "Beware the Undying King!" And he goes to
run off, away.

807
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,499
LAURA: Is he already gone?

808
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:37,228
MATT: He's running away.

809
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:40,423
MARISHA: Man, I don't know how to deal with that
type of abrasive personality.

810
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:47,651
LAURA: Maybe it's best to not let people give him
power, because the more people believe in him, the

811
01:17:47,651 --> 01:17:49,197
stronger of a god he becomes.

812
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:56,286
MARISHA: But that guy resisted. He knew when
others didn't. And he was crazy.

813
01:17:56,286 --> 01:18:01,037
LAURA: Could you maybe make the sun reappear?

814
01:18:01,037 --> 01:18:12,715
MARISHA: I don't know. Can I do a nature check to
see if this is above my capabilities?

815
01:18:12,715 --> 01:18:21,667
MATT: It's definitely an unnatural form of weather
pattern. You get the sense that this is itself a

816
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:23,178
minor miracle.

817
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:25,134
MARISHA: A minor miracle?

818
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:30,961
MATT: Well, yeah. The sky that stretches beyond
all sides of the horizon is of similar strange,

819
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:33,481
roiling cloud doom.

820
01:18:33,481 --> 01:18:35,527
LAURA: Is it like Ghostbusters?

821
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:41,206
MATT: It's very similar, yeah. We're talking top
of the tower, curling ink clouds out to each side,

822
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:47,144
traveling with vast speed in almost all
directions. You see no plain, single path in which

823
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,110
they're traveling. They're emanating.

824
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,512
MARISHA: This seems like a minor miracle.

825
01:18:52,512 --> 01:18:56,638
LAURA: Yeah. Can you miracle more?

826
01:18:56,638 --> 01:19:06,526
MARISHA: I could maybe try to carve out a patch of
sunlight above us, but I don't think it would be

827
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:09,260
anything more than a morale boost, at this point.

828
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,027
TALIESIN: If we did it at a temple, perhaps.

829
01:19:11,027 --> 01:19:13,180
LAURA: Maybe above the Sarenrae temple.

830
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:16,650
LIAM: He's bearing down on us. We need to tell
Pike. We need to warn the authorities. We need to

831
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,368
tell the Temple of Bahamut, the Slayer's Take.

832
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:25,408
MARISHA: We have to keep people from defecting to
him. The more people that he has, the more of his

833
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:30,374
symbols that get spread around out of fear, the
more he'll win.

834
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:35,897
TRAVIS: Right, but we can only either spread the
word that we're going to resist or spread the word

835
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:38,869
that it's about time to fight. We can only do one
or the other.

836
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:41,422
LIAM: He's coming, one way or another.

837
01:19:41,422 --> 01:19:44,626
MARISHA: I turn to one of the guards of
Vasselheim.

838
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:47,992
MATT: One of them's rushing past. He has a cluster
of spears under one arm.

839
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,086
MARISHA: Sir!

840
01:19:49,086 --> 01:19:50,230
MATT: "Yes?"

841
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:56,280
MARISHA: If there was a universal sign of
Vasselheim, a symbol of Vasselheim, or a sign to

842
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,697
fight, what would it be?

843
01:19:58,697 --> 01:20:06,243
(laughter)

844
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:14,776
MATT: "There is no universal symbol. There are
many symbols in Vasselheim. All the various

845
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,333
"divinities that lie here have their own symbol."

846
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:23,272
MARISHA: Okay. I didn't know if there was like a
rally or cry or something that you all universally

847
01:20:23,272 --> 01:20:28,561
believed in. There's got to be something, a symbol
of Vasselheim.

848
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:31,627
MATT: "Vasselheim is a divided and united city as
one."

849
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:36,552
MARISHA: All right, you know what? Never mind!
Jeez, your politics.

850
01:20:36,552 --> 01:20:51,263
MATT: He gives a strange glint of a glare towards
your larger goliath friend. Right as he begins to

851
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:57,158
squint, you hear a voice in the distance go,
"Lieutenant, we need you!"

852
01:20:57,158 --> 01:20:59,651
"Right away." And he rushes off with spears under
his arm.

853
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:08,657
MARISHA: Thanks, Lieutenant, for nothing. Okay,
maybe some sort of sign will help them.

854
01:21:08,657 --> 01:21:12,227
TALIESIN: If we're going to make a sun appear--

855
01:21:12,227 --> 01:21:14,268
LAURA: Let's do it at the temple of Sarenrae or
the temple of Pelor.

856
01:21:14,268 --> 01:21:16,283
MARISHA: All right, we go to the temple of
Sarenrae!

857
01:21:16,283 --> 01:21:22,108
MATT: You make your way to the temple. You enter
the interior, and you can see most everyone is in

858
01:21:22,108 --> 01:21:28,906
silent prayer. They're all either holding hands or
clutching close their smaller kin, these renewed

859
01:21:28,906 --> 01:21:38,737
worshippers of the Everlight. Glancing around, you
don't see Pike currently in the vicinity. All you

860
01:21:38,737 --> 01:21:43,801
see is one of the head priests, Coraline, who's
currently off to the side is tending to a few of

861
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:48,109
the folks from the interior.

862
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:49,460
LIAM: (shouting) Pike?

863
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:54,700
MATT: Coraline looks over and sees you guys enter.
"Oh!" Rushes up to you. "I'm sorry, she's not

864
01:21:54,700 --> 01:22:00,748
"here, she went to the Platinum Sanctuary.
Apparently, there's a discussion, a meeting of

865
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:02,122
"some kind."

866
01:22:02,122 --> 01:22:03,107
MARISHA: Right now?

867
01:22:03,107 --> 01:22:04,885
MATT: "Right now. She left not but an hour ago."

868
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:05,809
MARISHA: Okay, go!

869
01:22:05,809 --> 01:22:06,819
LIAM: Thank you.

870
01:22:06,819 --> 01:22:07,948
MATT: "Of course."

871
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:17,609
(laughter)

872
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:23,624
MATT: Walking up the endless stair along the side of
the mountain that signifies the northern end of

873
01:22:23,624 --> 01:22:28,870
Vasselheim, you see small units of silver and blue
armored warriors of the Platinum Dragon descend

874
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:34,332
past you, rushing and giving you a sidelong glance
as they do. A nod of recognition as some of them

875
01:22:34,332 --> 01:22:36,962
recognize you upon your approach.

876
01:22:36,962 --> 01:22:43,192
Eventually, through an exhausting ascent and
seeing the clouds growing darker and darker, you

877
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:47,445
begin to see that there is, from this vantage
point, a very slight shift in their direction.

878
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:50,756
They seem to be coming from the northwest.

879
01:22:50,756 --> 01:22:57,761
You eventually reach the base of the massive
pillars that mark the stronghold's entrance, where

880
01:22:57,761 --> 01:23:03,868
you've been a number of times before. You
immediately notice a crowd of mixed attire. You

881
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:11,910
see Scalebearers standing tensely along various
Bastion members. You see warriors of the Dawn Fist

882
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:20,403
in their gold and red robes. And you see soldiers
of brass and sapphire: the Hand of Ord is here, as

883
01:23:20,403 --> 01:23:31,979
well. Now, upon approaching the guards. The guards
at the front gate see you and expectantly signify

884
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:39,368
for the gates to open with a shifting (thudding).
The two large marble doorways open inside, just

885
01:23:39,368 --> 01:23:41,889
enough for you to pass within.

886
01:23:41,889 --> 01:23:47,361
You enter the central chambers, the inner sanctum
of the Platinum Sanctuary, where the marble halls

887
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:53,908
lead to the familiar circular forum chambers where
you last met with the Highbearer Vord, the

888
01:23:53,908 --> 01:24:02,025
Silver-Touched, who stands there before you, among
his guard, in heated discussion. The room is

889
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:06,620
lively with representatives of each temple
clustered behind their highest lord. The red-robed

890
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:14,610
Dawn Fist of Kord flank Earthbreaker Groon.
Philosophers gather near Holy Curator Curtis Uleas

891
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:21,017
of the Quadroads of Erathis. The Gladekeepers of
the Birthheart stand behind the High Hierophant

892
01:24:21,017 --> 01:24:29,583
Ophera, while the dark-veiled maidens of the Raven
Queen gather, leaderless, as is their order. Pike

893
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:34,047
stands at the edge of the council, trying to
listen in, before seeing you and rushing to your

894
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:37,198
side. (panting) "Hi!"

895
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:39,439
TRAVIS: Pike!

896
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:45,289
MATT: She rushes in and gives a few quick hugs.
"Did it work? Did you do it?"

897
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,002
TRAVIS: Yeah! (whispering) We got the stuff.

898
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:51,370
LAURA: (whispering) We made them!

899
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:58,183
MATT: "Good. Things are a bit tense." And as she
turns, you see now at the back of the council,

900
01:24:58,183 --> 01:25:04,755
towering over most others and without armed
support stands the dark-skinned, beautiful J'mon

901
01:25:04,755 --> 01:25:16,930
Sa Ord, their simple clothing swathed in a loose
hanging robe of gold and sky blue. J'mon's

902
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:22,985
smoldering pupils shift in your direction, and
they give you a nod of respect. The discussions

903
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:29,941
halt as you approach, recognition also falling
across the room. At which point, the Highbearer

904
01:25:29,941 --> 01:25:39,233
Vord turns to you saying, "Vox Machina, with a gift
of timing. Have you anything to aid in this crisis?"

905
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:42,514
LAURA: Like, so much.

906
01:25:42,514 --> 01:25:50,651
MATT: "Then please, take the center of the
chambers. I believe everyone here could use some

907
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:56,096
"form of good news." He steps back, and as the rest
of the guards empty, they open the central space

908
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,463
of the chamber for you to approach.

909
01:25:58,463 --> 01:26:05,354
TALIESIN: Well, technically we've already been
observable, so there's very little that we can say

910
01:26:05,354 --> 01:26:06,810
that he doesn't already know.

911
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,674
LAURA: He's listening right now.

912
01:26:08,674 --> 01:26:10,754
LIAM: How much do you know already?

913
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:15,792
MATT: "We have only taken a bit from what your
companion here, Pike of the Everlight, has said.

914
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:19,166
"You went off to a volcano?"

915
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,034
TRAVIS: Scaldseat.

916
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:24,579
MARISHA: And we defeated it!

917
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:28,203
MATT: "You defeated a volcano?"

918
01:26:28,203 --> 01:26:29,602
TRAVIS: No.

919
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,060
MARISHA: Kind of.

920
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:39,264
LAURA: Look, I'm sure you've realized by this
point that Vecna has ascended to godhood.

921
01:26:39,264 --> 01:26:47,571
MATT: As he begins to speak, immediately the High
Hierophant Ophera steps forward. "Yes, the dreams

922
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:55,611
"have spread. We've seen and spoken with the
clerics all across this land, and it seems that a

923
01:26:55,611 --> 01:27:01,765
"new force has shoved its way amongst the rest of
the pantheon, though apparently closer."

924
01:27:01,765 --> 01:27:09,894
LAURA: He's not reached his full power yet. The
only way it will happen is if he claims a great

925
01:27:09,894 --> 01:27:12,472
use of power.

926
01:27:12,472 --> 01:27:17,332
MARISHA: Yeah, performs a miracle. He needs
followers.

927
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:21,941
LAURA: He's on his way here. The more followers he
has, the more power he has.

928
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:26,804
MATT: At that, when you say, "he's on his way
here," you watch as Groon steps forward, arms

929
01:27:26,804 --> 01:27:32,826
still crossed. "How do you know he's coming?"

930
01:27:32,826 --> 01:27:39,624
MARISHA: (stammers) Just look outside.

931
01:27:39,624 --> 01:27:45,025
TRAVIS: Keyleth, hey, whoa. Take it down.

932
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:49,910
SAM: We don't need the sass.

933
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:52,444
MARISHA: But I'm not sassing!

934
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:59,946
TRAVIS: With respect, there are those among us
that can tell where he is moving.

935
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,387
LAURA: Yeah.

936
01:28:01,387 --> 01:28:03,555
LIAM: I am the paladin of the Raven Queen.

937
01:28:03,555 --> 01:28:11,981
MATT: At which point two of the maidens behind you
say in unison together, "That he is, and the

938
01:28:11,981 --> 01:28:17,614
"visions we've seen, as well. The pretender god.
His words, channeled through prayers, speak of a

939
01:28:17,614 --> 01:28:25,106
"new terror, a vile tyrant unchecked. Believe him.
His words are that of our lady." And both of them

940
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:27,305
step back once more.

941
01:28:27,305 --> 01:28:29,244
MARISHA: Have you met them before?

942
01:28:29,244 --> 01:28:31,077
MATT: They said it in unison.

943
01:28:31,077 --> 01:28:35,568
MARISHA: Are you friends? Are you on the same
mailing list?

944
01:28:35,568 --> 01:28:39,771
LIAM: They all look similar.

945
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:45,435
LAURA: So yeah, he's got this ability.

946
01:28:45,435 --> 01:28:52,930
LIAM: She has granted me knowledge of his
whereabouts, and he is coming fast.

947
01:28:52,930 --> 01:29:01,179
MATT: Vord now speaks up from behind. "Good, then
let us gather our resources. The esteemed J'mon Sa

948
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:04,757
"Ord has agreed to lend aid and resources to our
defense."

949
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:11,512
At which point, J'mon speaks up. "This threat
stretches beyond the borders of Issylra. The

950
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:18,668
"clouds darken even our desert skies. If this
specter of the Age of Arcanum has indeed ascended,

951
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:25,449
"as the clerics here are convinced, then it is a
threat that we of Ank'Harel cannot ignore."

952
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:35,251
Vord then turns his head frustratingly to the east
and says, "And King Bertrand Dwendal has declined

953
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:41,206
"aid, claiming that until this rumored scourge
arrives on Dwendalian soil, it is of no interest

954
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:49,913
"to the crown of Wildemount. No resources can be
spared chasing whispers. We have sent out scouting

955
01:29:49,913 --> 01:29:54,946
"parties, however. As you've said, this threat
seems to be coming from the northwest, last you

956
01:29:54,946 --> 01:30:01,222
"came through. And wyvern riders are seeking the
location of this Thar Amphala."

957
01:30:01,222 --> 01:30:09,131
At which point, there's a flash of blue arcane
energy in the back of the room. Everyone turns;

958
01:30:09,131 --> 01:30:15,862
the guards have their weapons drawn out ready. And
you spin to see a familiar blonde-haired mage with

959
01:30:15,862 --> 01:30:17,132
braids on the side--

960
01:30:17,132 --> 01:30:21,353
(cheering)

961
01:30:21,353 --> 01:30:37,302
MATT: A bit out of breath, and in the same flash
behind, a golden-armored halfling of sun-kissed

962
01:30:37,302 --> 01:30:48,166
skin and long, golden, curling hair. Large weapon
dragging behind. Allura then, hand up in

963
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:56,742
resignation, staff to the side. "We are merely
here to offer counsel and communication. We mean

964
01:30:56,742 --> 01:31:03,035
"no harm, nor to bring our arcane knowledge to your
quarters, and I apologize, but extenuating

965
01:31:03,035 --> 01:31:10,764
"circumstances require strange bedfellows, I think
you will agree. However, at the first sight of

966
01:31:10,764 --> 01:31:17,603
"threat upon Tal'Dorei, understand that we will
seek your assistance with haste, as well. Emon and

967
01:31:17,603 --> 01:31:24,420
"the council cannot survive another catastrophe, so
we are here to behest and ask only you're ready to

968
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,877
"return depending on when or where this assault
strikes."

969
01:31:28,877 --> 01:31:37,149
There's a bit of muttering amongst the crowd and
some grumbling. Highbearer Vord nods. "We are in

970
01:31:37,149 --> 01:31:42,602
"need of aid and as many friends as we can gather.
You are welcome, Arcanist Vysoren."

971
01:31:42,602 --> 01:31:48,402
LAURA: Allura, does the sky look like this in
Emon?

972
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:56,295
MATT: "It, in the past 12 hours or so, has
stretched across the Ozmit Sea and now seeks to

973
01:31:56,295 --> 01:32:04,833
"consume as far as the east coast of Tal'Dorei. If
this is what I believe it is, within the next

974
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:11,597
"half-to-full day the entirety of Exandria will be
under the shaded sky of Vecna."

975
01:32:11,597 --> 01:32:22,571
SAM: Well, maybe the miracle thing is just the
change in weather, and we'll be okay.

976
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:31,094
(laughter)

977
01:32:31,094 --> 01:32:34,707
SAM: Not all miracles have to be deadly.

978
01:32:34,707 --> 01:32:45,650
MATT: "Very well. Will you be there fighting with
our armies, in the front line?"

979
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:53,133
TRAVIS: We will. I guess my only question is: do
we wait for him to come to us, or do we try to

980
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:55,414
take the fight to him?

981
01:32:55,414 --> 01:33:02,223
MATT: "I do not wish to fight him where he expects
it. As we are a city that has prided itself on its

982
01:33:02,223 --> 01:33:10,709
"impenetrable defenses, I can guarantee you that
this entity has seemingly procured, or cleverly

983
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:19,516
"divined, some way of breaching. I gather he would
expect less us bringing it to him. We hoped to

984
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:24,355
"have information on the whereabouts of this city
directly. What else do we have?"

985
01:33:24,355 --> 01:33:28,225
LAURA: We have the knowledge that we can't take
him by surprise.

986
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:31,825
MATT: "What do you mean?"

987
01:33:31,825 --> 01:33:33,680
LAURA: He sees everything.

988
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,335
TALIESIN: He hears everything.

989
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:39,235
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's been spying on us for quite
some time now, little shit.

990
01:33:39,235 --> 01:33:42,304
MARISHA: I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spy
in this room.

991
01:33:42,304 --> 01:33:45,406
TALIESIN: Or at least an open ear.

992
01:33:45,406 --> 01:33:53,496
MARISHA: You have citizens of your city that are
starting to paint his symbol on their doors out of

993
01:33:53,496 --> 01:34:03,263
fear. This is the last thing you want in the
middle of this crisis. All time spent with any

994
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:11,412
volunteer hands need to be from any spare clerics
who can help calm the minds of the afraid.

995
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:17,300
MATT: He looks out amongst the rest of the crowd
that has gathered here in the center inner

996
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:28,545
sanctum. "Her words speak true. If he's indeed
seeking to undermine the worship of this city, and

997
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:39,715
"as such break the defenses of our great creators,
then we need whatever strength your temples have

998
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:45,195
"here, calming the people of Vasselheim and beyond.
If you think he sees all--"

999
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:49,292
TALIESIN: I think he sees this city as a ripe
audience.

1000
01:34:49,292 --> 01:35:07,578
MATT: At this point, you watch as Vord steps
forward, fiddling with one finger. "Long ago, this

1001
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:17,870
"grand temple nearly fell to the prying minds of
terrible mages. This here," and he pulls a ring

1002
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:26,842
from his finger, "is called the Band of Shrouds, a
powerful implement of the Highbearer to shunt

1003
01:35:26,842 --> 01:35:40,287
"these prying magics aside. I lend it to you for
the coming struggle." And he passes it over to

1004
01:35:40,287 --> 01:35:46,827
Vex'ahlia.

1005
01:35:46,827 --> 01:35:49,726
LAURA: Yes!

1006
01:35:49,726 --> 01:35:57,982
MATT: "Kept close enough to the one who wears this
ring, I doubt even his newly born eyes could

1007
01:35:57,982 --> 01:36:09,206
"pierce it. However, it can only affect those
nearby, so if you are to strike, perhaps it's best

1008
01:36:09,206 --> 01:36:12,517
"you do so away from his vision, and we distract."

1009
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:16,936
LAURA: So he can't hear us right now?

1010
01:36:16,936 --> 01:36:21,989
MATT: Everyone in the room takes a few steps
closer to you.

1011
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:25,271
(laughter)

1012
01:36:25,271 --> 01:36:30,560
MATT: "Within this chamber, it seems so, yes."

1013
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,319
LAURA: (sighs) It feels so good!

1014
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,982
LIAM: I think that would look better on your
middle finger, darling.

1015
01:36:38,982 --> 01:36:43,013
LAURA: Oh, good call.

1016
01:36:43,013 --> 01:36:49,181
MATT: At which point the doors in the back of the
chamber burst open once more, and you watch as two

1017
01:36:49,181 --> 01:36:57,008
armored figures come rushing up out of breath.
(panting) You see as these two wyvern riders,

1018
01:36:57,008 --> 01:37:03,665
recognizing their armor with the horns and the
large dragon-like build of their armor and

1019
01:37:03,665 --> 01:37:10,017
headpiece, looking damaged and splashed with
crimson, come charging in. One of them, the helmet

1020
01:37:10,017 --> 01:37:16,626
is removed and you see a young man shouting
through his wounded breaths. "Highbearer! Rider

1021
01:37:16,626 --> 01:37:26,306
"Ephatus, with Rider Marley, returning from beyond
Moldire and the Tordusk pass. We found the Dark City."

1022
01:37:26,306 --> 01:37:30,796
Everyone immediately begins to mutter beneath
their breath. The voices begin to rise as the

1023
01:37:30,796 --> 01:37:37,341
Highbearer puts his hand out to hush them. "It
lies within a valley a few miles into the Zenwick

1024
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:43,552
"Mountains. Our team attempted to infiltrate, but
an unseeable barrier protects the city grounds

1025
01:37:43,552 --> 01:37:49,456
"from all sides. We found ourselves overrun by
errant magics and winged beasts of shadow and

1026
01:37:49,456 --> 01:37:54,360
"hunger. Only Marley and myself survived. We were
only a scouting regiment!"

1027
01:37:54,360 --> 01:38:03,802
At which point, the High Hierophant steps forward.
"Zenwick, of all places. Curious indeed."

1028
01:38:03,802 --> 01:38:13,481
The Highbearer turns again. "Very well, if this is
true, we must mobilize our forces very quickly."

1029
01:38:13,481 --> 01:38:20,480
Groon steps forward once more. "We can push our
ground troops along the Glasswalk Road, towards

1030
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,232
"the range."

1031
01:38:22,232 --> 01:38:29,981
Allura steps forward to join the conversation. "If
we can choose some elite select numbers for an

1032
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:32,723
"onsite assault, I can transport them."

1033
01:38:32,723 --> 01:38:39,995
At which point the Curator Curtis steps in.
"You'll do nothing of the kind! It is arcane

1034
01:38:39,995 --> 01:38:45,675
"perversions that enabled this madman, and we will
<i>not</i> allow--"

1035
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:51,668
Ophera steps forward, putting her hand in front of
his face now, saying, "We have druids who are

1036
01:38:51,668 --> 01:38:57,711
"familiar with the woods surrounding the base of
the Zenwick Mountains. We could transport you to

1037
01:38:57,711 --> 01:39:01,130
"those trees, a number of you, for an initial
assault while the rest of our ground forces

1038
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:03,529
"assemble northward."

1039
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:13,873
At which point, the wounded rider speaks up,
loudly. "I am not done! My apologies. Only Marley

1040
01:39:13,873 --> 01:39:20,383
"and myself survived with one of our wyverns. As we
fled over the nearest mountaintop as fast as we

1041
01:39:20,383 --> 01:39:22,727
"could, Marley saw--"

1042
01:39:22,727 --> 01:39:28,668
And the other one takes her helmet off, and you
can see caked with blood, one eye swollen shut and

1043
01:39:28,668 --> 01:39:40,101
a giant wound across the face. "I saw the city
move, part of it. It moved, I swear it. I heard a

1044
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:51,899
"rumble over the winds, looked past and back over
our shoulders, and I saw the city begin to rise."

1045
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:58,623
Silence takes the room. I would like any of you
with a fair amount of history to make a history check.

1046
01:39:58,623 --> 01:40:04,371
TALIESIN: What's a fair amount?

1047
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:08,073
MATT: If you feel confident in your ability to
understand history. I would say putting it this

1048
01:40:08,073 --> 01:40:11,360
way, those who have researched the lands that
would probably be Percival and Scanlan.

1049
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:17,899
TALIESIN: Okay.

1050
01:40:17,899 --> 01:40:22,811
SAM: 27!

1051
01:40:22,811 --> 01:40:24,052
TALIESIN: 21.

1052
01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:35,291
MATT: 27? Okay! I'll make part of this a whisper.

1053
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:38,446
LAURA: Wait, you'll make what? I didn't hear it!

1054
01:40:38,446 --> 01:40:39,862
SAM: A <i>live</i> whisper.

1055
01:40:39,862 --> 01:40:46,240
MATT: There are two places in the Zenwick
Mountains that would be of any interest, or

1056
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:54,025
historical lore-based elements. There is the
Crypts of Thomara: it's a subterranean vault city,

1057
01:40:54,025 --> 01:41:02,057
built around a precious metal vein cluster by the
xenophobic dwarven Thomara clan in the early years

1058
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:08,708
of the Age of Arcana. It's said a terrible madness
fed into their greed, leading to eventual

1059
01:41:08,708 --> 01:41:15,396
cannibalism and collapse of the society thousands
of years ago. It's now considered cursed and is

1060
01:41:15,396 --> 01:41:23,936
largely avoided. The other location is known as
the Silted Veil, a small, cold valley within the

1061
01:41:23,936 --> 01:41:29,014
mountains that is comprised of ice-dusted, mineral-rich
mud that was once rumored to carry natural

1062
01:41:29,014 --> 01:41:33,815
healing properties when applied to wounds and
restorative elements to aged skin. However, a

1063
01:41:33,815 --> 01:41:38,779
large variety of dangerous creatures also
discovered these features over time and moved into

1064
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:45,657
the valley, taking over and establishing a new
violent ecosystem based around the soothing muck.

1065
01:41:45,657 --> 01:41:53,949
Scanlan.

1066
01:41:53,949 --> 01:41:56,064
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys, so those t-shirts--

1067
01:41:56,064 --> 01:42:00,428
(laughter)

1068
01:42:00,428 --> 01:42:07,575
LAURA: Very true. There is Critical Role live Vox
Machina t-shirts.

1069
01:42:07,575 --> 01:42:12,464
MARISHA: Okay so the Crypts of (stumbles over
words) Tholmeer? Crypts of Tholmayer and the

1070
01:42:12,464 --> 01:42:13,750
Silted Veil.

1071
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:18,882
LAURA: Silted Veil and the Crypts of Tholmura?

1072
01:42:18,882 --> 01:42:22,954
MARISHA: Yeah, which are the two places in the
Zenwick Mountains?

1073
01:42:22,954 --> 01:42:26,391
LAURA: And one is icy valley, the other one is,
what, zombie dwarves?

1074
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:27,493
MARISHA: Yeah.

1075
01:42:27,493 --> 01:42:30,553
TALIESIN: Cannibal zombie dwarves.

1076
01:42:30,553 --> 01:42:35,216
MARISHA: Angry icy terrain or cannibal zombie
dwarves.

1077
01:42:35,216 --> 01:42:36,034
LAURA: Okay.

1078
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:45,160
MATT: At this information, Vord nods. "Well, all
forces on high for impending attack here, wyvern

1079
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,745
"riders and air units, we need eyes on the Tordusk
Pass, in case the city is indeed moving as they

1080
01:42:50,745 --> 01:42:57,047
"say. The High Hierophant will aid in transporting
advanced scouts to the base of the Zenwicks. We

1081
01:42:57,047 --> 01:43:02,580
"would wish you be part of this if you are willing
and able. Gathering information and seeking

1082

"weakness to exploit are the key. Vox Machina, you
are our focused stealth strike force into Thar

1083
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:13,192
"Amphala."

1084
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:16,878
LAURA: Yeah! We're <i>mostly</i> really good at that.

1085
01:43:16,878 --> 01:43:26,431
MATT: "If you indeed carry the boons that your
lady Pike has mentioned, then we need to keep

1086
01:43:26,431 --> 01:43:38,487
Vecna and his force occupied to grant you entry.
And we can do that. I certainly hope with the

1087
01:43:38,487 --> 01:43:43,940
strength of our numbers that there is no way that
he can see them coming.

1088
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:55,764
From the distant end of the central chamber here,
a familiar voice echoes throughout the hallway.

1089
01:43:55,764 --> 01:44:07,815
"Oh, but I do, wyrm groveler."

1090
01:44:07,815 --> 01:44:13,668
SAM: But the ring, man! We just got the ring!

1091
01:44:13,668 --> 01:44:15,891
MATT: You haven't attuned to it yet.

1092
01:44:15,891 --> 01:44:18,348
LAURA: Fuck!

1093
01:44:18,348 --> 01:44:20,532
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take our break.

1094
01:44:20,532 --> 01:44:28,116
(cheering)

1095
01:44:28,116 --> 01:44:30,125
LAURA: Come on!

1096
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:32,578
MARISHA: What all did we say?

1097
01:44:32,578 --> 01:44:35,454
TALIESIN: What <i>didn't</i> we say?

1098
01:44:35,454 --> 01:44:38,833
LAURA: Shit!

1099
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:40,960
LIAM: What a piece of shit!

1100
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:45,651
MATT: We'll take our break here. We'll return at
that moment here in a number of minutes.

1101
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:48,183
SAM: Ten minutes? 15 minutes? What are we doing?

1102
01:44:48,183 --> 01:44:52,040
MATT: You'll know when the lights start going.
We'll have people out there who'll let you know.

1103
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:56,891
It won't be too terribly long, we need to get a
bathroom break and stuff. Anyway, be back here in

1104
01:44:56,891 --> 01:45:01,678
a little bit, guys, we'll see you for the next
portion of our journey this evening.

1105
01:45:01,678 --> 02:07:01,119
[break]

1106
02:07:01,153 --> 02:07:06,574
LAURA: Fucked up because it's Trinket. It's a
Trinket cape. Yeah, but thank you. It's gorgeous.

1107
02:07:06,574 --> 02:07:08,807
TRAVIS: Really? Right now?

1108
02:07:08,807 --> 02:07:11,798
MARISHA: I'm rolling with someone's lucky die that
I got delivered.

1109
02:07:11,798 --> 02:07:18,225
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Gets a little hot!

1110
02:07:18,225 --> 02:07:20,419
LAURA: Yeah, it's warm. I'm already very warm.

1111
02:07:20,419 --> 02:07:22,587
TALIESIN: It's a little cold up here. That's
okay.

1112
02:07:22,587 --> 02:07:24,524
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you guys!

1113
02:07:24,524 --> 02:07:26,837
TALIESIN: There they are.

1114
02:07:26,837 --> 02:07:31,306
(laughter)

1115
02:07:31,306 --> 02:07:57,369
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1116
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:59,073
TRAVIS: We're missing one.

1117
02:07:59,073 --> 02:08:02,533
SAM: Who are we missing? Why? She was just here
with a bear.

1118
02:08:02,533 --> 02:08:04,005
TRAVIS: She's a moron!

1119
02:08:04,005 --> 02:08:14,554
SAM: Guys, thanks for coming to the show.

1120
02:08:14,554 --> 02:08:19,439
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

1121
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:22,938
MARISHA: Hey, Matt, was there a winner?

1122
02:08:22,938 --> 02:08:24,760
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Sam!

1123
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:28,384
SAM: I love Percy!

1124
02:08:28,384 --> 02:08:32,015
(laughter)

1125
02:08:32,015 --> 02:08:33,883
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not over yet.

1126
02:08:33,883 --> 02:08:35,835
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Where's Larkin?

1127
02:08:35,835 --> 02:08:40,940
TALIESIN: Larkin is in the hearts and minds of
children.

1128
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,674
MATT: Are we up and running?

1129
02:08:42,674 --> 02:08:43,725
TALIESIN: Are we going?

1130
02:08:43,725 --> 02:08:45,363
MATT: Are we on the internet?

1131
02:08:45,363 --> 02:08:49,215
MARISHA: Who's getting proposed to? All of us?!

1132
02:08:49,215 --> 02:08:51,164
LAURA: No, I think it was to Liam.

1133
02:08:51,164 --> 02:08:55,636
SAM: We need Brian Foster to come out here and
talk for 20 minutes and get the crowd hyped

1134
02:08:55,636 --> 02:08:56,567
again.

1135
02:08:56,567 --> 02:08:57,820
MATT: Yeah.

1136
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:06,360
(cheering)

1137
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:08,297
SAM: That'll work; that's fine.

1138
02:09:08,297 --> 02:09:16,040
MATT: That'll do! All righty, looking in the back
booth, are we good? Are we online? Perfect. Welcome

1139
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,291
back, everyone.

1140
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:25,811
So as the inner sanctum chambers of the Platinum
Sanctuary stood silent at the recent arrival of

1141
02:09:25,811 --> 02:09:34,322
the vision of Vecna, hovering but two feet off the
ground in all his lich-like glory. His toothy grin

1142
02:09:34,322 --> 02:09:40,820
is immense, threatening to crack the sides of his
face. As gasps fill the chamber, armored warriors

1143
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:46,170
thrust spear and blade towards his illusory body,
arrows and spells passing through harmlessly and

1144
02:09:46,170 --> 02:09:49,972
clattering, and splashing, exploding against
distant pillars across the room.

1145
02:09:49,972 --> 02:10:00,728
The smoke subsides and he stands there untouched.
"Quite the tea party you've gathered here, Vord. I

1146
02:10:00,728 --> 02:10:11,527
"suppose celebration is in order. After all, you
missed my re-birthday. I have something to show

1147
02:10:11,527 --> 02:10:20,513
"you that I'm quite excited about. Don't rush the
surprise, friends. I'll bring it to you; do not

1148
02:10:20,513 --> 02:10:30,489
"fret. You're all gathered here in one place. It
would be a perfect place for an ambush, wouldn't

1149
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:41,247
"you say? But where's the fun in that, when there
are so many less-protected loved ones to send my

1150
02:10:41,247 --> 02:10:45,577
"shadows to?

1151
02:10:45,577 --> 02:10:56,300
"Your daughter Desir, Earthbreaker, trains alone
at the Bozon Caves. An easy target. Vord of the

1152
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:05,126
"Platinum Dragon, your family lies behind the
double-sealed doors of your estate. I know of your

1153
02:11:05,126 --> 02:11:14,019
"secret cellar entrance. The great protector of
Marquet's jewel is away, and your studious

1154
02:11:14,019 --> 02:11:26,519
"concubines are left without their guard. Not to
mention all of Whitestone, or Cassandra. Young

1155
02:11:26,519 --> 02:11:36,110
"Velora Vessar now plays with her owlbear doll, all
alone in her room."

1156
02:11:36,110 --> 02:11:48,388
At this point, Allura shouts at the top of her
lungs, "That's enough!" And with a wave of her

1157
02:11:48,388 --> 02:12:01,081
hand, dispels the illusion with a flash of energy,
causing it to fade, leaving only the lingering

1158
02:12:01,081 --> 02:12:11,045
omnipresent sound of Vecna's chilling chuckle.
(chuckles) Then silence takes the room.

1159
02:12:11,045 --> 02:12:15,930
LAURA: Vord, does this need to be attuned?

1160
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:18,779
(laughter)

1161
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:20,675
MATT: "It does."

1162
02:12:20,675 --> 02:12:24,353
(laughter)

1163
02:12:24,353 --> 02:12:27,020
MARISHA: Why would you take it off?!

1164
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:32,123
MATT: "I was gifting it to you, I didn't realize
he was going to show up in my sanctum!"

1165
02:12:32,123 --> 02:12:40,148
LAURA: It's okay. I'm going to sit down. Keep
talking. I'm going to try to attune while that's

1166
02:12:40,148 --> 02:12:41,470
happening.

1167
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:50,524
MATT: Ophera steps forward. "It's a distraction, a
bluff. We're close, and he knows it."

1168
02:12:50,524 --> 02:12:59,247
Vord then turns to her and says, "I will not
abandon my family. Vecna knows too much, we have

1169
02:12:59,247 --> 02:13:08,654
"no more time. Those who are primed for assault, it
begins now. Vox Machina, how do you wish to

1170
02:13:08,654 --> 02:13:10,236
"proceed?"

1171
02:13:10,236 --> 02:13:13,165
LAURA: Well, we can't tell you!

1172
02:13:13,165 --> 02:13:19,084
TALIESIN: I think we proceed by taking a 15-minute
nap, really, at this point.

1173
02:13:19,084 --> 02:13:27,966
MARISHA: What? Wait, did you make a decree and
then turn to us and say, "What's your plan?"

1174
02:13:27,966 --> 02:13:30,264
MATT: "Yes."

1175
02:13:30,264 --> 02:13:38,287
(laughter)

1176
02:13:38,287 --> 02:13:46,070
MATT: "You think I haven't heard tales of your
chaotic battle strategies? I cannot <i>attempt</i> to

1177
02:13:46,070 --> 02:13:53,411
"ascertain the nature of how you've survived the
trials you have, so I leave that entirely up to

1178
02:13:53,411 --> 02:13:58,482
"you. The rest <i>we</i> can handle, organize and
strategize."

1179
02:13:58,482 --> 02:14:00,450
LAURA: You do that.

1180
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:07,241
MATT: As you take a moment and rest, the rest of
the individuals there begin to talk amongst

1181
02:14:07,241 --> 02:14:12,636
themselves. The other leaders begin to set their
clerics and warriors, sending out orders to the

1182
02:14:12,636 --> 02:14:17,650
various temples across all of Vasselheim and
beyond to prepare themselves, some for the defense

1183
02:14:17,650 --> 02:14:22,321
of the city, and some to make their way northward
to wherever Thar Amphala will be found, head on.

1184
02:14:22,321 --> 02:14:26,718
While this happens, and you're currently attuning
to this ring--

1185
02:14:26,718 --> 02:14:31,077
LAURA: I'm un-attuning the Bracers of Archery in
order to attune to this ring.

1186
02:14:31,077 --> 02:14:33,812
MATT: Okay, you're removing the Bracers of Archery
and you're attuning to the ring. That's two less

1187
02:14:33,812 --> 02:14:35,911
damage on your ranged attacks.

1188
02:14:35,911 --> 02:14:41,211
LAURA: Do you have a card that I can see?

1189
02:14:41,211 --> 02:14:43,386
MARISHA: She wants that paper!

1190
02:14:43,386 --> 02:14:44,865
LAURA: I want that paper!

1191
02:14:44,865 --> 02:14:51,800
MATT: The ring card is in my hotel room, but you
will have it next week. But essentially what it

1192
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:57,543
does, while it's attuned to you and on you, within
60 feet of you at all times, divination magic is

1193
02:14:57,543 --> 02:14:59,319
inert and cancelled.

1194
02:14:59,319 --> 02:15:00,949
LAURA: And what's the name of it, exactly?

1195
02:15:00,949 --> 02:15:04,727
MATT: It is called the Band of Shrouds.

1196
02:15:04,727 --> 02:15:08,697
MARISHA: Also, the hotel printer was broken.

1197
02:15:08,697 --> 02:15:17,316
MATT: Even getting my sheets printed out for this
game has been a whole ordeal. Thank you, Dani! As

1198
02:15:17,316 --> 02:15:23,355
this is happening and you guys are amongst
yourselves figuring out what to do, and the rest

1199
02:15:23,355 --> 02:15:31,476
of the crowd is murmuring, you hear the footfalls,
another, another, another, the approach of J'mon

1200
02:15:31,476 --> 02:15:43,421
Sa Ord. "My warriors defend this city, but my
strength also lies in the front lines. If a

1201
02:15:43,421 --> 02:15:58,644
"distraction is what you need to succeed, there are
few things as distracting as a shining dragon. I

1202
02:15:58,644 --> 02:16:09,335
"will fly with the wyverns once Vox Machina has
been delivered, and the delivery shall be upon the

1203
02:16:09,335 --> 02:16:11,844
"wings I bear, if you'll have me."

1204
02:16:11,844 --> 02:16:18,316
(cheering)

1205
02:16:18,316 --> 02:16:20,182
LAURA: Dracarys!

1206
02:16:20,182 --> 02:16:25,489
MATT: And they give a bow and a nod.

1207
02:16:25,489 --> 02:16:28,598
LAURA: Has it been long enough that it's attuned?

1208
02:16:28,598 --> 02:16:33,981
MATT: Not yet, no. The rest of the people are
gathering about. You guys are, for the moment,

1209
02:16:33,981 --> 02:16:39,850
focused inward. Pike's there with you. There is a
tension being passed around, but right now they're

1210
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:43,502
letting you strategize before you bring what you
have to the table. Right now, they have nothing

1211
02:16:43,502 --> 02:16:45,223
until you have a strategy.

1212
02:16:45,223 --> 02:16:54,682
SAM: We know of two places to go to up near the
something mountains. Zenwick Mountains?

1213
02:16:54,682 --> 02:16:59,794
LAURA: I don't want to talk about it for a little
more time.

1214
02:16:59,794 --> 02:17:05,654
SAM: Sure, we'll definitely stay here, then.
Definitely be here the whole time.

1215
02:17:05,654 --> 02:17:08,212
MARISHA: You know what? We should go shopping!

1216
02:17:08,212 --> 02:17:13,693
TRAVIS: No, fuck that! We are <i>not shopping!</i> I'll
quit! I'll leave.

1217
02:17:13,693 --> 02:17:15,164
MARISHA: No, Grog! No!

1218
02:17:15,164 --> 02:17:18,184
LAURA: Maybe we should just give up.

1219
02:17:18,184 --> 02:17:25,980
TRAVIS: What is wrong with you?! First shopping,
and now we give up. What the fuck?!

1220
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:30,086
LAURA: No, you know what? Vecna's right. I'm
really worried about our family. We should all

1221
02:17:30,086 --> 02:17:32,836
split up and go be with our families right now.

1222
02:17:32,836 --> 02:17:37,192
MARISHA: And maybe we should convert. I should
just stab myself in the eye right now.

1223
02:17:37,192 --> 02:17:41,454
LAURA: Maybe you should! Maybe we will! Let's do
it.

1224
02:17:41,454 --> 02:17:42,828
MARISHA: Let's do that.

1225
02:17:42,828 --> 02:17:46,031
LIAM: Be priests of Vecna.

1226
02:17:46,031 --> 02:17:49,842
MARISHA and SAM: Praise Vecna.

1227
02:17:49,842 --> 02:17:51,295
TRAVIS: (shouting) What. The. Fuck?!

1228
02:17:51,295 --> 02:17:57,484
(laughter)

1229
02:17:57,484 --> 02:18:04,803
TRAVIS: Take it back. Now.

1230
02:18:04,803 --> 02:18:12,462
LIAM: No, I think that's a good idea. (sizzling)
And I start pushing Whisper slowly.

1231
02:18:12,462 --> 02:18:17,161
LAURA: No! Okay, seriously, that's too far. It's
too far, don't. I don't like it.

1232
02:18:17,161 --> 02:18:30,693
SAM: Don't worry, he can't be killed. Just like
<i>all of us</i> can't be killed.

1233
02:18:30,693 --> 02:18:39,486
TRAVIS: J'mon, I'm coming with you. These people
have lost their fucking minds.

1234
02:18:39,486 --> 02:18:47,391
MATT: "Do not worry, Grog. Be patient. I think
there is more to their words than you are-- sit

1235
02:18:47,391 --> 02:18:59,555
"down." For the sake of brevity, as everyone is
cautiously waiting for the ring's attunement,

1236
02:18:59,555 --> 02:19:05,612
eventually you feel the energy click as the ring
has been slipped on for this time. You feel

1237
02:19:05,612 --> 02:19:11,271
this slight shimmer of cold wash through your body
and extend outward. At which point, you know the

1238
02:19:11,271 --> 02:19:12,972
ring has finally been attuned.

1239
02:19:12,972 --> 02:19:14,571
SAM: All right, we can talk freely.

1240
02:19:14,571 --> 02:19:16,856
LIAM: Show it to us. How does it look?

1241
02:19:16,856 --> 02:19:18,643
LAURA: It looks fucking good.

1242
02:19:18,643 --> 02:19:20,413
TALIESIN: It looks quite nice.

1243
02:19:20,413 --> 02:19:22,320
LAURA: It looks great, Grog.

1244
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:23,817
TRAVIS: Yeah, quitter.

1245
02:19:23,817 --> 02:19:37,158
LAURA: Okay. Fuck Vecna; we're not for Vecna.
Yeah. I know! Change of heart. So we have two

1246
02:19:37,158 --> 02:19:40,798
options, right? What were you saying, Scanlan?

1247
02:19:40,798 --> 02:19:43,931
SAM: The Crypts of Fomora or the Silted Bale.

1248
02:19:43,931 --> 02:19:45,988
LAURA: The Stilted Bale?

1249
02:19:45,988 --> 02:19:47,391
SAM: The Silted Bale.

1250
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:50,287
MATT: Veil. It's a Veil.

1251
02:19:50,287 --> 02:19:53,271
MARISHA: Silted Veil and the Crypts of Thromora.

1252
02:19:53,322 --> 02:19:55,458
SAM: Fomora.

1253
02:19:55,458 --> 02:19:57,203
MARISHA: Fromora?

1254
02:19:57,203 --> 02:20:03,382
SAM: Sure. We know a general sense of where we're
going.

1255
02:20:03,382 --> 02:20:07,034
LAURA: So wait, we're going there why?

1256
02:20:07,034 --> 02:20:14,933
SAM: Those are the only places that we know within
the Zenwick Mountains that have any appeal.

1257
02:20:14,933 --> 02:20:19,790
LAURA: Okay, so we choose between those two as our
strike place?

1258
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:27,932
SAM: Yes. One of them is filled with crazy dwarf
cannibals. And the other one has ice mud that can

1259
02:20:27,932 --> 02:20:31,518
heal you.

1260
02:20:31,518 --> 02:20:35,436
MARISHA: But has turned violent, because nature is
angry.

1261
02:20:35,436 --> 02:20:40,392
LIAM: The druids are dropping us off at the base
of the mountain. We don't really know where either

1262
02:20:40,392 --> 02:20:41,861
of those things are.

1263
02:20:41,861 --> 02:20:45,211
LAURA: Maybe it's best that we don't let anyone
else know where we're going.

1264
02:20:45,211 --> 02:20:46,806
SAM: All right, including ourselves?

1265
02:20:46,806 --> 02:20:49,783
(laughter)

1266
02:20:49,783 --> 02:20:52,804
SAM: I like that plan!

1267
02:20:52,804 --> 02:20:56,221
LAURA: Yeah, because that way it'll all be a
surprise.

1268
02:20:56,221 --> 02:20:59,131
MARISHA: Didn't he already hear our two options?

1269
02:20:59,131 --> 02:21:01,126
MARISHA and LAURA: Did he?

1270
02:21:01,126 --> 02:21:03,930
SAM: We don't know.

1271
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:05,639
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1272
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:12,723
LAURA: I don't know what he heard. I don't know
how often he listens to us, I don't know any of that.

1273
02:21:12,723 --> 02:21:20,241
MARISHA: Man, how does it work? Does he have
several lines open and he switches back and forth?

1274
02:21:20,241 --> 02:21:22,628
LAURA: Does he have to actively listen, or is it a
passive thing?

1275
02:21:22,628 --> 02:21:24,865
MARISHA: And how bored is this guy?

1276
02:21:24,865 --> 02:21:28,999
LAURA: I mean that's the thing, I mean he's
building an army and trying to take over the

1277
02:21:28,999 --> 02:21:31,222
world. I can't imagine he's listening to us all
the time.

1278
02:21:31,222 --> 02:21:33,037
MARISHA: Yeah, he's just trolling us!

1279
02:21:33,037 --> 02:21:36,474
LIAM: In my opinion, the gods are generally bored
and looking for things to do.

1280
02:21:36,474 --> 02:21:40,908
LAURA: Yeah but him. He's doing things. Like he's
got shit to do.

1281
02:21:40,908 --> 02:21:48,618
TALIESIN: I'm personally thinking that an undead
army of cannibalistic dwarves would be very

1282
02:21:48,618 --> 02:21:56,492
appealing if I were starting an assault on a city
like this, and I would be heading my city in that

1283
02:21:56,492 --> 02:22:05,763
direction to raise a bunch of undead cannibalistic
dwarves. That's my vibe.

1284
02:22:05,763 --> 02:22:08,663
LIAM: So you, Percy, want to go burn them up?

1285
02:22:08,663 --> 02:22:13,773
TALIESIN: I feel like that's where we're going to
find them, and where we'll find them preoccupied.

1286
02:22:13,773 --> 02:22:24,790
MARISHA: But if we know that's what he would do, then
wouldn't he know that we would go to find him at

1287
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:27,586
what he would do?

1288
02:22:27,586 --> 02:22:31,436
TALIESIN: You're assuming that he's going to do
what he would expect us to think he would do in

1289
02:22:31,436 --> 02:22:33,203
the first place.

1290
02:22:33,203 --> 02:22:38,842
LAURA: Do we know what kind of creatures are in
the icy veil? Could there be ice giants there?

1291
02:22:38,842 --> 02:22:40,243
Would Vecna want ice giants?

1292
02:22:40,243 --> 02:22:43,289
MARISHA: Undead icy zombies?

1293
02:22:43,289 --> 02:22:47,840
MATT: There's an entire ecosystem of very
dangerous monstrosities that exist there, which

1294
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:53,903
means there are living and dead. An elephant
graveyard of various aberrations and terrible

1295
02:22:53,903 --> 02:22:55,253
creatures.

1296
02:22:55,253 --> 02:23:00,793
TRAVIS: Well, look, if there are undead cannibal
dwarves or whatever in the crypts, don't we need

1297
02:23:00,793 --> 02:23:02,760
clerics to deal with them?

1298
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:04,263
LIAM: We have a cleric.

1299
02:23:04,263 --> 02:23:05,416
SAM: Let's take her.

1300
02:23:05,416 --> 02:23:07,101
LAURA: Pike!

1301
02:23:07,101 --> 02:23:09,070
MATT: "Yeah?"

1302
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:12,802
LAURA: Are you willing to leave the temple now?

1303
02:23:12,802 --> 02:23:25,479
MATT: "I'm afraid for my people there, but I feel
I can probably send myself with you like I have in

1304
02:23:25,479 --> 02:23:26,739
"the past."

1305
02:23:26,739 --> 02:23:28,919
LIAM: It's all or nothing, Pickle.

1306
02:23:28,919 --> 02:23:36,508
MATT: "I feel bad abandoning everyone that I've
brought to the temple."

1307
02:23:36,508 --> 02:23:38,491
LAURA: You aren't abandoning them.

1308
02:23:38,491 --> 02:23:40,119
LIAM: You're shielding them.

1309
02:23:40,119 --> 02:23:45,717
MARISHA: You could always do like the astral
projection thing, right?

1310
02:23:45,717 --> 02:23:47,469
MATT: "That's what I was thinking of doing."

1311
02:23:47,469 --> 02:23:56,386
LAURA: Well, okay, but if you're astral
projecting, aren't you chilling in one room here,

1312
02:23:56,386 --> 02:23:59,493
not really communicating, anyway?

1313
02:23:59,493 --> 02:24:01,491
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1314
02:24:01,491 --> 02:24:06,583
MARISHA: I don't know if it's for Pike or for the
DM.

1315
02:24:06,583 --> 02:24:13,454
TALIESIN: We have a bit of a roving blind spot
here that we could use.

1316
02:24:13,454 --> 02:24:15,665
LAURA: 13.

1317
02:24:15,665 --> 02:24:18,441
MATT: 13?

1318
02:24:18,441 --> 02:24:24,131
LAURA: Oh no! But this can't be the only thing
that determines if she's an astral projection or

1319
02:24:24,131 --> 02:24:25,484
if she comes with us?

1320
02:24:25,484 --> 02:24:27,717
LIAM: My begging has to count, as well!

1321
02:24:27,717 --> 02:24:30,628
(laughter)

1322
02:24:30,628 --> 02:24:34,740
MARISHA: She destroyed a whole undead army being a
laser light beam.

1323
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:38,428
LIAM: Yeah! That's right, she Tron'd those
motherfuckers.

1324
02:24:38,428 --> 02:24:42,206
LAURA: Will everything work like normal if she's
astral projection?

1325
02:24:42,206 --> 02:24:50,474
MATT: I'll tell you what, if you're so eager to
bring Pike along, and Ashley can't play, do you

1326
02:24:50,474 --> 02:24:52,547
guys want to jaeger her? Because I don't want to.

1327
02:24:52,547 --> 02:24:55,695
LAURA: Yeah, we'll totally jaeger her if she's
okay with it.

1328
02:24:55,695 --> 02:25:01,999
MARISHA: Remember, we've talked about this.
There's also the thing that if she dies while

1329
02:25:01,999 --> 02:25:05,391
Ashley's not here, we're fucking assholes!

1330
02:25:05,391 --> 02:25:07,419
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

1331
02:25:07,419 --> 02:25:10,609
LAURA: Okay, that's very true.

1332
02:25:10,609 --> 02:25:14,782
MARISHA: She won't die if she's a (bubbling)
thing.

1333
02:25:14,782 --> 02:25:19,319
LAURA: But if she's an astral projection, can she
still use the champion's blessing that she got

1334
02:25:19,319 --> 02:25:21,464
from Sarenrae and stuff?

1335
02:25:21,464 --> 02:25:22,777
MATT: We'll find out.

1336
02:25:22,777 --> 02:25:24,373
LAURA: Motherfuck.

1337
02:25:24,373 --> 02:25:27,100
MARISHA: But we can always easily go get her.

1338
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,905
TRAVIS: It's the best we can do.

1339
02:25:28,905 --> 02:25:36,201
MATT: The dungeon master will remember that.

1340
02:25:36,201 --> 02:25:42,194
TRAVIS: All right, so what, the Crypts or the
Silted Veil?

1341
02:25:42,194 --> 02:25:49,399
SAM: One thing that I can tell you about the
Crypts that you may not know. They're not man-made

1342
02:25:49,399 --> 02:25:56,628
crypts. They're actually the inside of a fallen
titan's body.

1343
02:25:56,628 --> 02:26:00,677
LAURA: How do you know that?

1344
02:26:00,677 --> 02:26:02,792
SAM: I know things.

1345
02:26:02,792 --> 02:26:07,701
(laughter)

1346
02:26:07,701 --> 02:26:14,987
SAM: It seems like a pretty godly place to go to
make a statement.

1347
02:26:14,987 --> 02:26:19,570
LIAM: Are you telling me we're going to have to
crawl into another monster's asshole? Is that what

1348
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:21,134
you're saying?

1349
02:26:21,134 --> 02:26:24,387
SAM: It's Friday.

1350
02:26:24,387 --> 02:26:30,508
MARISHA: And now we have two immovable rods!

1351
02:26:30,508 --> 02:26:42,785
(cheering)

1352
02:26:42,785 --> 02:26:50,082
TALIESIN: That got weird.

1353
02:26:50,082 --> 02:26:52,261
SAM: All right.

1354
02:26:52,261 --> 02:26:53,320
TRAVIS: So the Crypts?

1355
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:58,253
SAM: To the Crypts, I say. But are we druiding
there and then flying on a dragon, or just flying

1356
02:26:58,253 --> 02:26:59,915
on a dragon?

1357
02:26:59,915 --> 02:27:06,932
MATT: Pike's, "Well, I mean, I'll come with you if
that's all right? If we're going to this, we need to do

1358
02:27:06,932 --> 02:27:14,859
"this together. I trust the city guard. And if it
gets real bad, you'll take us back, right,

1359
02:27:14,859 --> 02:27:16,347
"Keyleth?"

1360
02:27:16,347 --> 02:27:17,911
MARISHA: What?

1361
02:27:17,911 --> 02:27:22,496
MATT: "If it gets real bad, you'll take us back,
right?"

1362
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:25,483
MARISHA: Yeah!

1363
02:27:25,483 --> 02:27:31,913
MATT: "Then let's do it!" And she puts her hand
out towards Grog.

1364
02:27:31,913 --> 02:27:35,349
TRAVIS: (shouting) Fuck yeah, buddy!

1365
02:27:35,349 --> 02:27:44,341
(cheering)

1366
02:27:44,341 --> 02:27:49,973
MATT: It looks like most of the sanctum is now
dissipating and heading out towards the front of

1367
02:27:49,973 --> 02:27:54,744
the temple and going about some sort of structured
exit to prepare for this assault.

1368
02:27:54,744 --> 02:27:56,127
LIAM: Allura!

1369
02:27:56,127 --> 02:28:04,035
MATT: As she's standing by, walking with Kima,
they're in a heated discussion with a member of

1370
02:28:04,035 --> 02:28:14,066
the Paramours of the Quadroads. She turns.
"Vax'ildan, yes. It's good to see you."

1371
02:28:14,066 --> 02:28:26,624
LIAM: It is <i>so</i> good to see you. We need advice.
We need help. There you go. When we fought Vecna,

1372
02:28:26,624 --> 02:28:37,704
he threw us around like ragdolls. He held us. He
did whatever he wanted. Do you have any way, any

1373
02:28:37,752 --> 02:28:44,764
<i>thing</i>, any suggestion for helping us avoid his
grasp again? Because if it went the way it went

1374
02:28:44,764 --> 02:28:47,771
the last time we are fucked right out of the
gate.

1375
02:28:47,771 --> 02:28:55,572
MATT: "What do you perceive as the weaknesses you
suffered in that previous battle?"

1376
02:28:55,572 --> 02:28:57,924
LIAM: What was that?

1377
02:28:57,924 --> 02:29:02,445
MATT: "What do you perceive are the weaknesses
that you suffered in that previous battle?"

1378
02:29:02,445 --> 02:29:04,313
LIAM: He was able to hold us, magically.

1379
02:29:04,313 --> 02:29:11,706
MATT: "There are ways to make sure those bindings
don't hold you still. There are magics that can

1380
02:29:11,706 --> 02:29:18,050
"prevent that. And if your enemy is as strong a
magic user as I know, he will use distance to his

1381
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:27,819
"advantage. Close that distance and make it your
advantage. I know not quite what he's capable of

1382
02:29:27,819 --> 02:29:38,644
"in his new ascended form, and that scares me. But
strike quickly, strike true. Everything you've

1383
02:29:38,644 --> 02:29:52,092
"got, work together. Communicate. And anything you
can do to allow yourself preparation, and the jump

1384
02:29:52,092 --> 02:30:01,515
"on this fray, do it. That ring that Vord gave you,
that'll be a boon enough. If you can catch him off

1385
02:30:01,515 --> 02:30:04,557
"guard, that might mean everything."

1386
02:30:04,557 --> 02:30:09,797
LIAM: Thank you.

1387
02:30:09,797 --> 02:30:17,022
LAURA: Do you know what kind of magic it is that
keeps him from holding us? Just wondering. You

1388
02:30:17,022 --> 02:30:19,093
said there were kinds, but I want to make sure.

1389
02:30:19,093 --> 02:30:22,961
MATT: "Certainly, there are a few in your midst
that you can utilize. There's a spell called

1390
02:30:22,961 --> 02:30:27,504
"Freedom of Movement that can prevent being held or
paralyzed in that way."

1391
02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:31,976
LAURA: That's good. Just making sure. Because I
thought that was what it was. I just wanted to

1392
02:30:31,976 --> 02:30:32,932
double-check.

1393
02:30:32,932 --> 02:30:37,883
MATT: "Completely understood."

1394
02:30:37,883 --> 02:30:41,237
SAM: Well, shall we away then? We have to go now!

1395
02:30:41,237 --> 02:30:48,795
MATT: "I'd like to come with you, but currently
with everything going on, let's be honest, if I'm

1396
02:30:48,795 --> 02:30:54,091
"not there amongst the council, it's going to tear
itself apart. The sky as it is, the people of Emon

1397
02:30:54,091 --> 02:30:58,361
"are threatening all sorts of insanity. I'm sure
you've seen shades of it here in a city which

1398
02:30:58,361 --> 02:31:09,150
"<i>has</i> faith. I myself am not completely absolved
of the dreams that haunt many others. I'll be

1399
02:31:09,150 --> 02:31:14,204
"doing what I can to pay attention, but do note
that ring also prevents me from seeing in on you,

1400
02:31:14,204 --> 02:31:23,111
"and I have to look out for Emon. Me and my lady
both."

1401
02:31:23,111 --> 02:31:26,210
She turns over to Kima, who is currently in the
process of getting into an argument with a wyvern

1402
02:31:26,210 --> 02:31:29,494
rider. You see her going, "Oh, come on. I can
ride, too!"

1403
02:31:29,494 --> 02:31:33,293
"Have you ever ridden a wyvern?"

1404
02:31:33,293 --> 02:31:42,131
"No! But I haven't met a wyvern I can't stare
down!" Wyvern rider turns around and chuckles and

1405
02:31:42,131 --> 02:31:46,925
gets tripped immediately onto his face, the crush
of metal on the banks and he spins over and she,

1406
02:31:46,925 --> 02:31:53,987
(harrumphs). Spins around and joins Allura's side
and goes, "I never really liked this place. Bunch

1407
02:31:53,987 --> 02:31:59,002
"of pricks. Good to see you guys."

1408
02:31:59,002 --> 02:32:02,337
TRAVIS: You as well, that Holy Avenger getting
some action lately?

1409
02:32:02,337 --> 02:32:10,421
MATT: "Oh, nowhere near enough. That's okay. You
come back, and you and me will have a tussle."

1410
02:32:10,421 --> 02:32:13,422
TRAVIS: God, I love Kima so much.

1411
02:32:13,422 --> 02:32:21,818
MATT: "Don't be all doom and gloom, all right?
That's a promise. Stay alive."

1412
02:32:21,818 --> 02:32:30,208
TRAVIS, LAURA, and LIAM: (singing) Stay alive.

1413
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:40,032
MATT: She looks up, and Allura looks down at her
and rubs the top of her head for a second. Kima

1414
02:32:40,032 --> 02:32:52,008
pulls away. "Come back safe, okay? I'm going to
hold you to that." And you see there's a moment of

1415
02:32:52,008 --> 02:32:56,948
her (sniffles), and she spins around not wanting
to show any weakness or emotion.

1416
02:32:56,948 --> 02:33:06,308
Allura looks back and watches her turn away and
goes, "You'll make it through this. I've seen you

1417
02:33:06,308 --> 02:33:07,975
"do great things."

1418
02:33:07,975 --> 02:33:12,186
SAM: We'll try.

1419
02:33:12,186 --> 02:33:24,367
MATT: "And you'll succeed. You have to. You have
many at your back. Look." And she puts her hand

1420
02:33:24,367 --> 02:33:30,040
out and you can see now there's at least over 100
wyvern riders, all scattered amongst the various

1421
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:35,933
mountain outcroppings that are all getting on top
of their great winged beasts that are fully

1422
02:33:35,933 --> 02:33:43,577
armored with wyvern barding and armor. They're
taking off in clusters and circling. "They're all

1423
02:33:43,577 --> 02:33:52,224
"counting on you. They're going to make sure that
you have the opportunity you have, to put those to

1424
02:33:52,224 --> 02:34:08,859
"good use." And she glances off to the side of your
pouch, closed as it is. "Come back." She turns

1425
02:34:08,859 --> 02:34:11,339
around to go and join Kima.

1426
02:34:11,339 --> 02:34:14,932
LAURA: Give Gilmore a hug for us, will you?

1427
02:34:14,932 --> 02:34:22,427
MATT: She stops and turns. "I'll do that. I owe
him a visit, anyway."

1428
02:34:22,427 --> 02:34:29,166
LIAM: And if he has any trinkets that lend Freedom
of Movement, we'll place an order.

1429
02:34:29,166 --> 02:34:32,241
MATT: "I'll ask."

1430
02:34:32,241 --> 02:34:35,242
LIAM: Tell him we say hi.

1431
02:34:35,242 --> 02:34:46,418
MATT: "I will, and I'm sure he does as well. Take
care. Be safe. Come back." She turns and walks

1432
02:34:46,418 --> 02:34:47,803
away.

1433
02:34:47,803 --> 02:34:51,256
MARISHA: Did you see that?

1434
02:34:51,256 --> 02:34:52,929
LAURA: See what?

1435
02:34:52,929 --> 02:34:56,478
MARISHA: They think we're going to die!

1436
02:34:56,478 --> 02:35:03,299
(laughter)

1437
02:35:03,299 --> 02:35:06,269
SAM: They're right!

1438
02:35:06,269 --> 02:35:08,171
TALIESIN: Safe bet.

1439
02:35:08,171 --> 02:35:10,272
TRAVIS: I feel pretty encouraged.

1440
02:35:10,272 --> 02:35:11,707
LAURA: Yeah?

1441
02:35:11,707 --> 02:35:13,242
TRAVIS: I don't know why.

1442
02:35:13,242 --> 02:35:18,168
LAURA: Well, I'm glad.

1443
02:35:18,168 --> 02:35:27,140
MARISHA: So what exactly is our plan? Is it to try
and keep Vecna from gaining more forces, or are we

1444
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:30,263
trying to cut off Vecna and his forces?

1445
02:35:30,263 --> 02:35:34,497
LAURA: I think they're taking care of the forces.
We're taking care of the god.

1446
02:35:34,497 --> 02:35:37,233
TALIESIN: They're the distraction.

1447
02:35:37,233 --> 02:35:39,460
MARISHA: Then why go through the crypt?

1448
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:41,443
TALIESIN: We think that's where they're headed.

1449
02:35:41,443 --> 02:35:46,344
LIAM: But are we trying to take out potential
additional forces?

1450
02:35:46,344 --> 02:35:49,640
TALIESIN: That'd be my thought. That's where I
would go.

1451
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:53,410
MARISHA: Is that not what other people are doing?

1452
02:35:53,410 --> 02:35:58,031
TALIESIN: I think that the surprise that he's
expecting to bring to the city, possibly,

1453
02:35:58,031 --> 02:36:04,048
especially with the information you brought, is
that he would try and raise this creature and use

1454
02:36:04,048 --> 02:36:05,618
it against the city.

1455
02:36:05,618 --> 02:36:11,913
LAURA: So he's basically wanting to raise a giant
zombie titan full of zombie cannibal dwarves, and

1456
02:36:11,913 --> 02:36:16,332
then they'll poo them out to fight other people.

1457
02:36:16,332 --> 02:36:20,530
TALIESIN: Somehow you make that less threatening.
I'm not sure how you do that.

1458
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:28,075
LIAM: You know it's like when you take a duck and
you put it inside a chicken and then you put the

1459
02:36:28,075 --> 02:36:30,525
chicken inside a turkey.

1460
02:36:30,525 --> 02:36:36,644
SAM: Well, let's get going before he starts
raising this thing. Come on!

1461
02:36:36,644 --> 02:36:38,533
TALIESIN: Turducken of the Damned.

1462
02:36:38,533 --> 02:36:46,743
(laughter)

1463
02:36:46,743 --> 02:36:53,410
LAURA: Here's the thing, are we relying on Grog to
stab these trammels through Vecna?

1464
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:58,457
LIAM: Or do we each need to deliver the one tied
to our gods?

1465
02:36:58,457 --> 02:37:01,970
TALIESIN: If we can all three in one swift
movement once we've weakened--

1466
02:37:01,970 --> 02:37:06,240
LAURA: It takes three separate attacks, I'm
assuming, right? Or would it be attack, attack,

1467
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:07,557
attack?

1468
02:37:07,557 --> 02:37:15,315
(laughter)

1469
02:37:15,315 --> 02:37:16,615
TALIESIN: So much sass.

1470
02:37:16,615 --> 02:37:20,986
MATT: You gather by the nature of their
enchantment and the size of it, you can't cluster

1471
02:37:20,986 --> 02:37:23,405
them together like darts and jam them into the
board at once.

1472
02:37:23,405 --> 02:37:29,974
LAURA: Okay, but it would be one of those
situations where you'd have to attack and then

1473
02:37:29,974 --> 02:37:32,425
draw another one, and then attack, right?

1474
02:37:32,425 --> 02:37:33,897
MATT: It's possible.

1475
02:37:33,897 --> 02:37:36,576
SAM: Or three of us could each have one.

1476
02:37:36,576 --> 02:37:42,154
MARISHA: But he mentioned Vecna has to be severely
damaged--

1477
02:37:42,154 --> 02:37:44,569
LAURA: Already, before we even do that.

1478
02:37:44,569 --> 02:37:53,612
MATT: There have to be breaks in the avatar form
for them to pierce. There have to be breaks,

1479
02:37:53,612 --> 02:38:01,132
wounds, visible cracks in the veneer of the avatar
for the actual trammels to pierce.

1480
02:38:01,132 --> 02:38:09,010
MARISHA: So we're talking about doing this. Hey,
DM? Logistical question: how many days does it

1481
02:38:09,010 --> 02:38:17,400
take me to make a 4th-level scroll? Spell. Spell
scroll? 4th-level. How many days?

1482
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:20,417
TRAVIS: Say it a couple more times.

1483
02:38:20,417 --> 02:38:30,257
MATT: That's going to be quite a while, that's
weeks and weeks and weeks. That's a downtime

1484
02:38:30,257 --> 02:38:31,634
activity.

1485
02:38:31,634 --> 02:38:36,729
SAM: I thought our whole deal was we're about to
go do a surprise attack? We have to go <i>now</i>.

1486
02:38:36,729 --> 02:38:41,976
LAURA: We do. We're saying we don't have time to
make a scroll spell, scroll scroll, spell scroll.

1487
02:38:41,976 --> 02:38:48,067
MARISHA: Allura also said, yo, plan. Maybe plan a
little.

1488
02:38:48,067 --> 02:38:53,862
LIAM: Also, DM: did we get told for these
trammels, for these harpoons, that they need to be

1489
02:38:53,862 --> 02:38:58,263
wielded by the person associated to their gods, or
can Grog chuck them all?

1490
02:38:58,263 --> 02:39:04,386
MATT: From what you understand there was no
specification of that. It was more the fusing of

1491
02:39:04,386 --> 02:39:08,756
the divine energy within the trammels' creation
grants it with the power. The means of delivering

1492
02:39:08,756 --> 02:39:10,628
it doesn't seem to be as important.

1493
02:39:10,628 --> 02:39:12,113
LAURA: But it is a melee weapon?

1494
02:39:12,113 --> 02:39:16,982
MATT: It's javelin-like; it could be thrown.

1495
02:39:16,982 --> 02:39:20,615
TALIESIN: We didn't make them to be aerodynamic,
did we?

1496
02:39:20,615 --> 02:39:24,984
MATT: They're somewhat aerodynamic by nature. Once
again, you can certainly try.

1497
02:39:24,984 --> 02:39:29,116
LAURA: I'm going to pass the Pelor trammel back to
you.

1498
02:39:29,116 --> 02:39:38,180
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement. But I have
three 4th-level spells. I can start burning into

1499
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:45,255
my 5th-level spells, as well, but it lasts for an
hour, so I was trying to figure out if there's a way--

1500
02:39:45,255 --> 02:39:47,220
MATT: Pike says, "I can also do it."

1501
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:50,245
MARISHA: Oh! Yeah!

1502
02:39:50,245 --> 02:39:55,903
LAURA: And it's not concentration, right, so you
can also cast Death Ward?

1503
02:39:55,903 --> 02:39:57,733
MATT: "It lasts for an hour."

1504
02:39:57,733 --> 02:39:59,786
TALIESIN: We'll wait until we're a little closer.

1505
02:39:59,786 --> 02:40:02,205
LAURA: And Death Ward lasts for eight hours?

1506
02:40:02,205 --> 02:40:10,327
MATT: "Death Ward? Yes! They're both 4th-level,
though."

1507
02:40:10,327 --> 02:40:15,625
TRAVIS: These words are all great and everything
but it's not going to change that we're going to

1508
02:40:15,625 --> 02:40:20,546
have to make it up when we get there, so why don't
we go ahead and fight this fucking fucker?

1509
02:40:20,546 --> 02:40:25,611
(cheering)

1510
02:40:25,611 --> 02:40:34,527
MATT: As you begin to descend down the stairs on
the outskirts of the mountainside, you can see

1511
02:40:34,527 --> 02:40:40,861
the wyvern riders have now gathered into two large
units, and in the distance, shrieks of wyvern calls

1512
02:40:40,861 --> 02:40:47,884
begin to echo through the mountain range. They all
begin to swoop towards the Abundant Terrace. You

1513
02:40:47,884 --> 02:40:50,187
guys follow suit?

1514
02:40:50,187 --> 02:40:51,455
LAURA: Sure.

1515
02:40:51,455 --> 02:40:56,314
MATT: All right, as you make your way to the
Abundant Terrace on the outskirts of the

1516
02:40:56,314 --> 02:41:01,122
Birthheart, there are the orchards, the large
clusters of trees that you have traveled to and

1517
02:41:01,122 --> 02:41:06,153
from before when travelling to and from Vasselheim
at Keyleth's behest. And there you can see a

1518
02:41:06,153 --> 02:41:14,744
number of the high priest druids of Melora have
all gathered around the High Hierophant, and

1519
02:41:14,744 --> 02:41:19,911
they're preparing means of transport for all the
troops, wyverns included, to those that are going

1520
02:41:19,911 --> 02:41:26,580
to make it as part of this initial front-line
assault. As you guys approach and watch, you see

1521
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:33,547
as other generals and such begin to gather their
army units. They begin to discuss orders, and a

1522
02:41:33,547 --> 02:41:38,692
number of them in the middle of this refer over to
you guys. You can see there's definitely direction

1523
02:41:38,692 --> 02:41:43,462
being given in regards to you guys. Someone wants
to stop their alarm?

1524
02:41:43,462 --> 02:41:46,135
TALIESIN: Okay, this is going to be weird.

1525
02:41:46,135 --> 02:41:48,716
LAURA: Is it yours?

1526
02:41:48,716 --> 02:41:50,856
TALIESIN: It's that.

1527
02:41:50,856 --> 02:41:52,754
MATT: Oh, there's an actual alarm on the stage.

1528
02:41:52,754 --> 02:41:54,386
MARISHA: Oh my god, there is!

1529
02:41:54,386 --> 02:41:58,692
SAM: When it turned 12 midnight, the alarm clock
went off!

1530
02:41:58,692 --> 02:42:00,462
MATT: It's not flashing.

1531
02:42:00,462 --> 02:42:02,333
MARISHA: That's hilarious!

1532
02:42:02,333 --> 02:42:05,419
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin.

1533
02:42:05,419 --> 02:42:10,914
(cheering)

1534
02:42:10,914 --> 02:42:14,724
LAURA: He just hit snooze, you guys.

1535
02:42:14,724 --> 02:42:18,457
LIAM: Yeah, five more minutes, Raven Mom. Five
more minutes.

1536
02:42:18,457 --> 02:42:22,933
LAURA: It was all a dream!

1537
02:42:22,933 --> 02:42:35,957
MATT: As you approach, Ophera steps up. "It would
be my honor to grant you passage to the base of

1538
02:42:35,957 --> 02:42:41,116
"the mountain range. I believe your other companion
is approaching soon, as well." And she looks over

1539
02:42:41,116 --> 02:42:47,897
past your shoulder as you glance and you see J'mon
Sa Ord approaching. Within their arms is a small

1540
02:42:47,897 --> 02:42:54,936
leather chest, a container of some kind. J'mon
steps up and places it before you, pulls it back

1541
02:42:54,936 --> 02:42:59,505
and backs away with a brandishing presentation.

1542
02:42:59,505 --> 02:43:01,205
LAURA: What is it?

1543
02:43:01,205 --> 02:43:17,023
MATT: "May these potions keep you healthy." Within
here, there are eight superior healing potions.

1544
02:43:17,023 --> 02:43:23,255
LAURA: Whoa! Okay.

1545
02:43:23,255 --> 02:43:32,241
TRAVIS: Well, we're really in for a fucking fight,
huh?! When the game gives you eight superiors.

1546
02:43:32,241 --> 02:43:36,817
LAURA: So everybody take one superior, right?

1547
02:43:36,817 --> 02:43:38,346
SAM: Everybody gets one.

1548
02:43:38,346 --> 02:43:39,807
MATT: And there's one extra.

1549
02:43:39,807 --> 02:43:42,076
LIAM: They are so fucking badass.

1550
02:43:42,076 --> 02:43:45,448
LAURA: Everybody gets one and there's one extra?

1551
02:43:45,448 --> 02:43:48,214
MATT: Yeah, because there are eight and you have
seven in your party.

1552
02:43:48,214 --> 02:43:53,851
LAURA: I'm going to mark down that Pike has one.

1553
02:43:53,851 --> 02:43:58,815
TALIESIN: And who's made of the most glass? Who's
going to get hit the most?

1554
02:43:58,815 --> 02:44:01,220
LIAM: Scanlan is important.

1555
02:44:01,220 --> 02:44:02,892
LAURA: Scanlan's super important.

1556
02:44:02,892 --> 02:44:04,865
LIAM: Scanlan should have two.

1557
02:44:04,865 --> 02:44:06,615
SAM: Guys, I'm fine.

1558
02:44:06,615 --> 02:44:10,198
(laughter)

1559
02:44:10,198 --> 02:44:14,299
LAURA: I know you're very fine and you're very
capable.

1560
02:44:14,299 --> 02:44:19,344
LIAM: Also karma is a thing, and I really want to
balance the scales.

1561
02:44:19,344 --> 02:44:24,248
SAM: Why would <i>you</i> feel any pressure that way?

1562
02:44:24,248 --> 02:44:28,393
LIAM: We've got a long road of history, you and
I.

1563
02:44:28,393 --> 02:44:29,925
SAM: We're best buds!

1564
02:44:29,925 --> 02:44:36,404
LIAM: Best buds! Best buds, met at Big Apple Anime
Fest in New York City all those years ago.

1565
02:44:36,404 --> 02:44:40,189
AUDIENCE: Aww.

1566
02:44:40,189 --> 02:44:49,397
SAM: All right, I'll take two.

1567
02:44:49,397 --> 02:44:50,733
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

1568
02:44:50,733 --> 02:44:52,736
SAM: In Marquesian I say, thank you, J'mon Sa Ord.

1569
02:44:52,736 --> 02:44:55,753
MATT: "Be pleased."

1570
02:44:55,753 --> 02:44:59,307
LAURA: We are. Very.

1571
02:44:59,307 --> 02:45:12,393
SAM: Also, if you don't like the Meat Man, I can
make him go away.

1572
02:45:12,393 --> 02:45:20,642
MATT: "Their business has not encroached upon the
order that we maintain. Yet."

1573
02:45:20,642 --> 02:45:23,460
(laughter)

1574
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:25,601
MATT: "You'd know if it did."

1575
02:45:25,601 --> 02:45:27,899
LIAM: (whispers) They know!

1576
02:45:27,899 --> 02:45:38,619
MATT: The smoldering pupils that they contain
within their darkened eyes stare back at you with

1577
02:45:38,619 --> 02:45:40,629
a curling smile.

1578
02:45:40,629 --> 02:45:46,898
SAM: Thank you. Let's go. We've got to get through
this druidy thing, right?

1579
02:45:46,898 --> 02:45:53,421
MATT: Ophera backs up and, putting her staff to one
side, makes a large oval shape with her fingers as

1580
02:45:53,421 --> 02:45:57,807
she mutters beneath her breath. You watch as one
of the heavy, thick trunks of the nearest tree

1581
02:45:57,807 --> 02:46:02,413
begins to tear and crack and pull inward. And
there you see in a similar fashion to Keyleth's

1582
02:46:02,413 --> 02:46:09,574
casting, though a little more visceral, an opening
reveals itself and a doorway is opened, and she

1583
02:46:09,574 --> 02:46:11,405
goes, "Quick! Now!"

1584
02:46:11,405 --> 02:46:14,237
MARISHA: I like your technique!

1585
02:46:14,237 --> 02:46:22,547
MATT: You all rush through, one after another,
flanked at the end by J'mon. And as you all

1586
02:46:22,547 --> 02:46:29,620
approach the opposite side of this portal, you
emerge in a somewhat crowded forest of pine trees.

1587
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:37,646
Immediately, the northern air is colder, and you
see drifting bits of snowfall softly coming

1588
02:46:37,646 --> 02:46:42,570
through bits of the tree line above you. You turn
around just in time to see the doorway close, and

1589
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:49,402
in the distance you see other doorways opening
around you in different trees, and you watch as

1590
02:46:49,402 --> 02:46:55,340
dozens upon dozens of wyvern riders and armored
soldiers begin to emerge, one cluster after the next.

1591
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:57,580
MARISHA: Fucking druids are badass!

1592
02:46:57,580 --> 02:47:03,958
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

1593
02:47:03,958 --> 02:47:14,454
MATT: You glance up and can briefly see the top
northern crest of where the Zenwick Mountain pass

1594
02:47:14,454 --> 02:47:21,189
is. Just past the canopy of the forest you're in,
because you were sent to the very slim base of the

1595
02:47:21,189 --> 02:47:27,499
Zenwick Mountains. You're within a forest. What do
you want to do?

1596
02:47:27,499 --> 02:47:30,039
LIAM: What does my Vec-dar tell me?

1597
02:47:30,039 --> 02:47:35,708
MATT: Interestingly enough, southeast of where you
are.

1598
02:47:35,708 --> 02:47:37,155
LIAM: Shit.

1599
02:47:37,155 --> 02:47:39,142
LAURA: How close?

1600
02:47:39,142 --> 02:47:44,708
MATT: I'd say it's probably close to four miles
from where you are.

1601
02:47:44,708 --> 02:47:52,152
LAURA: Oh shit.

1602
02:47:52,152 --> 02:47:55,816
MATT: And slowly moving away.

1603
02:47:55,816 --> 02:48:00,457
LIAM: We guessed wrong?

1604
02:48:00,457 --> 02:48:02,030
MARISHA: Four miles.

1605
02:48:02,030 --> 02:48:05,484
TALIESIN: Did we guess wrong?

1606
02:48:05,484 --> 02:48:09,102
LIAM: Well, we don't know where this shit is that
we're looking for.

1607
02:48:09,102 --> 02:48:10,770
SAM: Do we know where these things are?

1608
02:48:10,770 --> 02:48:14,274
MATT: They're both northwest of where you are, in
the mountain range.

1609
02:48:14,274 --> 02:48:15,890
MARISHA: He's passed them.

1610
02:48:15,890 --> 02:48:16,871
LIAM: Passed over.

1611
02:48:16,871 --> 02:48:18,341
MATT: He's passed over, it seems.

1612
02:48:18,341 --> 02:48:19,348
LIAM: Fuck.

1613
02:48:19,348 --> 02:48:22,635
SAM: What do we do?

1614
02:48:22,635 --> 02:48:30,320
MARISHA: If we get a little bit closer, I can do a
Commune with Nature spell and try and figure out

1615
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:32,934
some stuff. It's all I've got. I can scry!

1616
02:48:32,934 --> 02:48:39,057
LAURA: I mean, if he's already passed by the
crypts, is there any reason to go there? I don't

1617
02:48:39,057 --> 02:48:40,163
understand.

1618
02:48:40,163 --> 02:48:42,950
TRAVIS: What direction is Vasselheim from us now?

1619
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:44,349
MATT: Southeast.

1620
02:48:44,349 --> 02:48:45,798
MARISHA: The way they're heading.

1621
02:48:45,798 --> 02:48:51,105
TRAVIS: Anybody else think we should fucking hop
on a big-ass brass dragon and try and catch him

1622
02:48:51,105 --> 02:49:00,906
before he gets there? What are we going to do
here? There's nothing to do here!

1623
02:49:00,906 --> 02:49:02,845
LAURA: You want us to go fight Vecna right now?

1624
02:49:02,845 --> 02:49:06,513
TRAVIS: Either that, or he goes and sacks the city
and we're like, "What does this tree tell me about

1625
02:49:06,513 --> 02:49:07,969
"this area?"

1626
02:49:07,969 --> 02:49:17,957
(laughter)

1627
02:49:17,957 --> 02:49:21,949
LIAM: Quickly, please, someone come up with an argument
that counteracts that.

1628
02:49:21,949 --> 02:49:24,769
TALIESIN: We should scry on the dwarven city if we
can, really quickly.

1629
02:49:24,769 --> 02:49:26,969
SAM: How? We don't know much about it.

1630
02:49:26,969 --> 02:49:28,615
TALIESIN: Do we know enough to scry?

1631
02:49:28,615 --> 02:49:34,900
MARISHA: I can scry on Lady Briarwood.

1632
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:38,383
LAURA: Do it. Do it right now.

1633
02:49:38,383 --> 02:49:40,779
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Ooh!

1634
02:49:40,779 --> 02:49:43,471
MARISHA: Yeah, I bet she's with him.

1635
02:49:43,471 --> 02:49:45,542
TALIESIN: Or she's not.

1636
02:49:45,542 --> 02:49:48,153
LIAM: We'll learn something.

1637
02:49:48,153 --> 02:49:51,154
LAURA: Are you zoning in on the city, or are you
zoning in on Vecna?

1638
02:49:51,154 --> 02:49:55,593
TALIESIN: We know where Vecna is. We just need to
see where Lady Briarwood is.

1639
02:49:55,593 --> 02:49:57,740
MARISHA: All right, scrying on Briarwood. Oh, she
rolls.

1640
02:49:57,740 --> 02:50:00,031
MATT: She rolls. To make a saving roll. Spell DC
is?

1641
02:50:00,031 --> 02:50:01,858
MARISHA: 21!

1642
02:50:01,858 --> 02:50:04,384
MATT: And that is a 22.

1643
02:50:04,384 --> 02:50:08,529
(groaning)

1644
02:50:08,529 --> 02:50:13,959
MATT: Sorry. As you try and focus, the incantation
completes and as your vision begins to extend it

1645
02:50:13,959 --> 02:50:18,151
is blocked by darkness and sent back into your
form. And you realize the scry has failed, the

1646
02:50:18,151 --> 02:50:19,514
will is too strong.

1647
02:50:19,514 --> 02:50:22,479
LAURA: Can you scry on that death knight guy that
was next to her?

1648
02:50:22,479 --> 02:50:27,341
MARISHA: Is he still with her, though?

1649
02:50:27,341 --> 02:50:32,726
LAURA: We didn't kill him. We did not kill him. We
did not hit him! We did not!

1650
02:50:32,726 --> 02:50:36,763
(laughter)

1651
02:50:36,763 --> 02:50:45,750
MARISHA: Oh, hi Vex. All right. I'll scry on
undead douchey.

1652
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:55,483
MATT: As your vision extends from you, it races
through the darkness. You see dark clouds ahead.

1653
02:50:55,483 --> 02:51:03,606
As it fires down, you look instantly within the
streets of Thar Amphala. You see the cobblestone

1654
02:51:03,606 --> 02:51:11,679
roads now cracked and broken, you see buildings
appear to have sustained structural damage. You

1655
02:51:11,679 --> 02:51:16,631
see roofs are partially collapsed. And walking
down the street, strolling with a number of undead

1656
02:51:16,631 --> 02:51:21,897
soldiers at its back, the black knight you battled
before. As it struts through you watch as the

1657
02:51:21,897 --> 02:51:32,831
towers and buildings (rumbling) shake. And shake
again. And your vision returns.

1658
02:51:32,831 --> 02:51:34,581
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

1659
02:51:34,581 --> 02:51:42,501
MARISHA: It was shaking-- Oh, is it on the back of
some giant turtle or something?

1660
02:51:42,501 --> 02:51:45,488
(laughter)

1661
02:51:45,488 --> 02:51:48,647
TALIESIN: We should stop that from happening.

1662
02:51:48,647 --> 02:51:52,362
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're super lucky and it's just a
turtle.

1663
02:51:52,362 --> 02:52:00,735
(laughter)

1664
02:52:00,735 --> 02:52:03,222
TRAVIS: How lucky for us!

1665
02:52:03,222 --> 02:52:05,258
MARISHA: It'd be so cute.

1666
02:52:05,258 --> 02:52:12,148
MATT: "Then there is no time to waste." You watch
as J'mon Sa Ord's form shifts and giant brass

1667
02:52:12,148 --> 02:52:22,303
wings extend in a flash of reddish-orange energy.
The nearby trees bend and break at the sheer force

1668
02:52:22,303 --> 02:52:29,334
of the dragon's magnitude, their form expanding to
fill the recent vicinity of the forest, and with a

1669
02:52:29,334 --> 02:52:35,897
large guttural roar, you see before you the brass
dragon.

1670
02:52:35,897 --> 02:52:39,330
SAM: Shotgun!

1671
02:52:39,330 --> 02:52:45,373
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth? While we're flying through
the air, is it possible for you to give us a nice

1672
02:52:45,373 --> 02:52:47,754
inspiring speech?

1673
02:52:47,754 --> 02:52:50,554
MARISHA: Oh! (giggles)

1674
02:52:50,554 --> 02:52:54,315
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1675
02:52:54,315 --> 02:53:01,450
LIAM: It's all right. It's just our small group
here. No one's watching. You know us.

1676
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:11,913
MARISHA: Yeah. Man, inspiring speech. So we're on
a brass dragon?

1677
02:53:11,913 --> 02:53:18,412
MATT: You can do it while you're all climbing on
the back. They're waiting patiently for you all to

1678
02:53:18,412 --> 02:53:21,364
jump onto the back of the dragon form.

1679
02:53:21,364 --> 02:53:27,973
SAM: If you need a second to think about it, it's
okay. We can start off first and then come back to you.

1680
02:53:27,973 --> 02:53:29,775
MARISHA: Wait, what?

1681
02:53:29,775 --> 02:53:32,080
SAM: Do you need a second to compose yourself?

1682
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:35,677
MARISHA: You know, Scanlan.

1683
02:53:35,677 --> 02:53:42,734
(cheering)

1684
02:53:42,734 --> 02:53:49,951
MARISHA: It's funny you should mention that,
because I do need a second. I have to think about

1685
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:56,567
my words deeply and a long time, and even still,
they come out wrong, and you're so witty and

1686
02:53:56,567 --> 02:54:01,987
quick! And you can come up with things like
speeches and songs on the fly in front of

1687
02:54:01,987 --> 02:54:12,281
thousands of people way quicker than I can. It is
not my strength, but I do know my strength, and I

1688
02:54:12,281 --> 02:54:27,092
know each of your strengths. But not as well of
each of you know your strengths as well as you do.

1689
02:54:27,092 --> 02:54:33,832
SAM: Sing it, sister.

1690
02:54:33,832 --> 02:54:40,661
MARISHA: What I'm saying is, you should believe in
yourselves the way that I believe in you, Scanlan.

1691
02:54:40,661 --> 02:54:52,091
And the way that you believe in everyone else,
Scanlan! Because you're all strong and unique. And

1692
02:54:52,091 --> 02:54:53,826
we're probably going to die.

1693
02:54:53,826 --> 02:54:58,865
(laughter)

1694
02:54:58,865 --> 02:55:04,036
MARISHA: (stammers) Okay, let's fly! Ahoy!

1695
02:55:04,036 --> 02:55:27,292
MATT: With a slow, metallic, crinkling sound of
brass dragon scales curling, the large head of

1696
02:55:27,292 --> 02:55:34,196
J'mon Sa Ord's dragon form spins around to look
you dead in the face, Keyleth. The same dark eyes

1697
02:55:34,196 --> 02:55:39,103
with the smoldering, burning cores for pupils, the
mouth opens and you can smell immediately the

1698
02:55:39,103 --> 02:55:46,602
breath that has a very earthy, singed, burnt-wood
scent to it.

1699
02:55:46,602 --> 02:55:50,638
MARISHA: Ooh, cedar!

1700
02:55:50,638 --> 02:56:00,925
MATT: And the voice goes forth. "Very good,
Keyleth. I found that quite inspiring."

1701
02:56:00,925 --> 02:56:12,745
(cheering)

1702
02:56:12,745 --> 02:56:16,294
MATT: And with that, you guys can all take your 18
temporary hit points.

1703
02:56:16,294 --> 02:56:18,587
TRAVIS: How much is it?

1704
02:56:18,587 --> 02:56:20,695
TALIESIN: 18 temporary hit points?

1705
02:56:20,695 --> 02:56:30,454
MATT: And with that note, with one large push of
their strong dragon wings, J'mon Sa Ord raises

1706
02:56:30,454 --> 02:56:35,249
beyond the treeline up into the sky above, where
you can see the clusters of wyvern riders have now

1707
02:56:35,249 --> 02:56:42,957
also gathered to survey the territory. The first
thing you notice, the southward wall, the tall,

1708
02:56:42,957 --> 02:56:48,395
rocky landscape surrounding the fields of ice,
dust, and grasses that fill this pass, you can see

1709
02:56:48,395 --> 02:56:55,251
the mountain range seems to have suffered an
immense amount of damage. A gargantuan fresh

1710
02:56:55,251 --> 02:57:00,534
rockslide nearly a mile wide, now resting at the
base of the northern mountain, you can see

1711
02:57:00,534 --> 02:57:04,337
swallowing and burying some of the forest land.

1712
02:57:04,337 --> 02:57:16,711
And as you glance southward into the Tordusk Pass,
you can see mammoth holes in the ground, large

1713
02:57:16,711 --> 02:57:23,989
craters of broken dirt and rock forced into dunes
of mud and shale surrounding their outsides. The

1714
02:57:23,989 --> 02:57:31,982
scars, pockmarks 200 feet across, carved into the
terrain. I'd like everyone to make an intelligence

1715
02:57:31,982 --> 02:57:34,085
check, please.

1716
02:57:34,085 --> 02:57:38,480
LAURA: We're making a what, an intelligence
check?

1717
02:57:38,480 --> 02:57:40,739
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

1718
02:57:40,739 --> 02:57:41,718
MATT: Sure.

1719
02:57:41,718 --> 02:57:42,641
MARISHA: Yeah?

1720
02:57:42,641 --> 02:58:01,496
(cheering)

1721
02:58:01,496 --> 02:58:03,123
MATT: Vex'ahlia?

1722
02:58:03,179 --> 02:58:04,711
LAURA: Is this an intelligence?

1723
02:58:04,711 --> 02:58:06,177
MATT: Yes. This is your intelligence modifier.

1724
02:58:06,177 --> 02:58:07,076
LAURA: 21.

1725
02:58:07,076 --> 02:58:08,777
MATT: 21, good. Vax?

1726
02:58:08,777 --> 02:58:11,166
LIAM: Oh, man. Eight.

1727
02:58:11,166 --> 02:58:13,355
MATT: Keyleth?

1728
02:58:13,355 --> 02:58:15,471
MARISHA: I am doing a nature check.

1729
02:58:15,471 --> 02:58:16,688
MATT: Right, to find out?

1730
02:58:16,688 --> 02:58:24,045
MARISHA: If it looks like a path has been bore
through in a straight line, like it looks like

1731
02:58:24,045 --> 02:58:25,710
it's going through. 24.

1732
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:31,202
MATT: 24? What you can tell from a nature check is
that these are not natural formations in the

1733
02:58:31,202 --> 02:58:39,058
ground. These are blunt trauma to the ground that
has caused these large craters.

1734
02:58:39,058 --> 02:58:42,840
LAURA: Does it look like a walking path? A very
large walking path?

1735
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,493
MATT: Percival?

1736
02:58:44,493 --> 02:58:46,232
TALIESIN: Natural 20, for 25.

1737
02:58:46,232 --> 02:58:50,330
MATT: Scanlan?

1738
02:58:50,330 --> 02:58:51,454
SAM: 19 total.

1739
02:58:51,454 --> 02:58:57,704
MATT: Okay. Percival. And Keyleth. And Perc'ahlia.
Not you Grog, sorry.

1740
02:58:57,704 --> 02:59:00,725
TRAVIS: Holes!

1741
02:59:00,725 --> 02:59:13,065
MATT: You do notice, upon immediate view, that
these large holes are patterned, staggered about

1742
02:59:13,065 --> 02:59:24,672
every 350-400 feet. And they do almost present the
gait of a walking creature.

1743
02:59:24,672 --> 02:59:27,637
MARISHA: (anguished sounds)

1744
02:59:27,637 --> 02:59:30,045
TRAVIS: Hey! You got that big fucking turtle you
wanted!

1745
02:59:30,045 --> 02:59:34,776
MARISHA: It is a giant turtle!

1746
02:59:34,776 --> 02:59:41,415
LIAM: The final miniature is just Matt.

1747
02:59:41,415 --> 02:59:48,221
MATT: "It has been foreseen!" I've been working on
my costume.

1748
02:59:48,221 --> 02:59:53,325
LAURA: Do we see anything in the air, any of those
shadow creatures? Or is it just our wyvern

1749
02:59:53,325 --> 02:59:54,121
riders?

1750
02:59:54,121 --> 02:59:58,115
MATT: Make a perception check.

1751
02:59:58,115 --> 02:59:59,588
LAURA: Natural 20!

1752
02:59:59,588 --> 03:00:07,002
MATT: Okay. As you lift up to survey more
territory, you manage to get a brief view over the

1753
03:00:07,002 --> 03:00:14,945
edge of that mountain range. You do not see any of
the gloomstalkers that you had previously faced

1754
03:00:14,945 --> 03:00:19,768
near Thar Amphala. In the vicinity, there is only
the wyvern riders and a few errant birds that

1755
03:00:19,768 --> 03:00:24,925
normally take to the skies that are keeping a wide
berth from your sudden emerging army that has

1756
03:00:24,925 --> 03:00:30,138
joined you in the skies. You glance over this
mountain range, and you look about. About two,

1757
03:00:30,138 --> 03:00:35,295
three miles northward, you can see the same path
of destruction has torn through these mountain

1758
03:00:35,295 --> 03:00:43,049
ranges in a sinkhole, hundreds and hundreds of
feet across that disappears into darkness.

1759
03:00:43,049 --> 03:00:50,753
LAURA: Is the sinkhole in the direction of the
city that's moving right now?

1760
03:00:50,753 --> 03:00:53,809
MATT: No, it's in the direction you guys were
planning to travel.

1761
03:00:53,809 --> 03:00:57,164
SAM: Oh. Maybe that's where they ripped the thing
out.

1762
03:00:57,164 --> 03:01:02,958
TALIESIN: It's where it came out. How big are
these footprints, approximately?

1763
03:01:02,958 --> 03:01:11,519
LAURA: (shouting) That's the fucking titan! It's
the titan full of dwarf bodies! I just realized that!

1764
03:01:11,519 --> 03:01:14,255
(laughter)

1765
03:01:14,255 --> 03:01:19,248
MARISHA: It totally fucking is, yeah. Yeah.

1766
03:01:19,248 --> 03:01:22,734
LIAM: And his name is Larkin.

1767
03:01:22,734 --> 03:01:28,166
(laughter)

1768
03:01:28,166 --> 03:01:36,429
LAURA: Shit! I thought it was just a really big
giant, and then I remembered it was a titan.

1769
03:01:36,457 --> 03:01:43,917
MATT: Yes, each one of these craters is roughly
150 or so feet across.

1770
03:01:43,917 --> 03:01:47,705
SAM: Oh, his feet are a hundred feet across?!

1771
03:01:47,705 --> 03:01:49,458
MATT: 150 to 200 feet across, yeah.

1772
03:01:49,458 --> 03:01:53,898
TALIESIN: Keyleth, how big would a creature be if
it had footprints approximately 150 to 200 feet

1773
03:01:53,898 --> 03:01:54,840
across?

1774
03:01:54,840 --> 03:01:59,599
SAM: At least a hundred feet big!

1775
03:01:59,599 --> 03:02:01,161
MARISHA: Probably bigger?

1776
03:02:01,161 --> 03:02:03,537
SAM: Maybe even bigger!

1777
03:02:03,537 --> 03:02:07,667
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to find out how
fucking big this guy is?

1778
03:02:07,667 --> 03:02:09,079
MATT: Sure.

1779
03:02:09,079 --> 03:02:17,451
MARISHA: Yeah! Let's do this lucky one. That's not
too bad. 28.

1780
03:02:17,451 --> 03:02:21,123
MATT: Based on your experience with various
creatures that leave large tracks you've dealt

1781
03:02:21,123 --> 03:02:30,100
with or hunted in your history with the Ashari,
it's <i>big</i>. The legs generally are pretty thick

1782
03:02:30,100 --> 03:02:37,748
for a creature of immense size because it has to
support all that weight, but if each footfall,

1783
03:02:37,748 --> 03:02:44,759
crater here is about 150, 200 feet wide, you can
surmise the creature is hundreds of feet tall.

1784
03:02:44,759 --> 03:02:46,824
TRAVIS: At least six times.

1785
03:02:46,824 --> 03:02:53,339
LAURA: At least 600 feet tall. What did you say?

1786
03:02:53,339 --> 03:02:56,098
LIAM: I said we're going to have to Shadow of
Colossus this shit.

1787
03:02:56,098 --> 03:02:58,734
LAURA: How are we going to fucking fight something
that's 600 feet tall?

1788
03:02:58,734 --> 03:03:01,600
TRAVIS: If it bleeds, we-- we're going to die.

1789
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:12,309
(laughter)

1790
03:03:12,309 --> 03:03:19,653
MARISHA: Hang on, though. Caverns. Undead caverns
of dwarves inside the titan.

1791
03:03:19,682 --> 03:03:23,578
LIAM: Yeah, maybe we crawl up its butthole and
kill the things inside.

1792
03:03:23,578 --> 03:03:26,623
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe, or fight it from the inside
out?

1793
03:03:26,623 --> 03:03:28,071
LAURA: Maybe?

1794
03:03:28,071 --> 03:03:33,082
TALIESIN: That's the most exciting Dwarven Forge
thing I'd ever want to see. The Godzilla

1795
03:03:33,082 --> 03:03:34,153
interior.

1796
03:03:34,153 --> 03:03:38,000
LAURA: We got to get inside of it.

1797
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:41,557
TALIESIN: It may be all it takes.

1798
03:03:41,557 --> 03:03:44,629
LAURA: Are we on J'mon Sa Ord's back?

1799
03:03:44,629 --> 03:03:50,587
MATT: Yes, right now it's large brass dragon
wings (flapping).

1800
03:03:50,587 --> 03:03:55,215
TALIESIN: Neverending Storying our way to a
terrible death.

1801
03:03:55,215 --> 03:04:01,726
TRAVIS: Can you detect if we're making up any
ground on your target? I'm talking to you, Vax.

1802
03:04:01,726 --> 03:04:05,041
SAM: Liam, are we getting closer?

1803
03:04:05,041 --> 03:04:12,489
LIAM: My brain's on Vecna, not on the city. Is
Vecna doing a ride-along? Is he still moving in

1804
03:04:12,489 --> 03:04:13,741
the same direction?

1805
03:04:13,741 --> 03:04:17,883
MATT: Yeah, Vecna's slowly traveling in that
southeast direction.

1806
03:04:17,883 --> 03:04:19,740
SAM: Follow the tracks, then.

1807
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:26,475
MATT: All right. With that, you hear the booming
voice of J'mon once more, "Very well. Let us be

1808
03:04:26,475 --> 03:04:32,700
"off." (whoosh) And goes into a fast-paced dive.
You all grab a hold of nearby dragon scale and/or

1809
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:38,093
loose bits of fur there are as it drives into this
huge dive, this gargantuan dragon.

1810
03:04:38,093 --> 03:04:40,816
LAURA: Trinket's in the necklace for this part.

1811
03:04:40,816 --> 03:04:42,862
MATT: I assumed as such.

1812
03:04:42,862 --> 03:04:49,750
TRAVIS and LIAM: (scared bear noises)

1813
03:04:49,750 --> 03:04:56,045
MATT: You see as the wyvern riders immediately
take this action and begin to swoop and follow

1814
03:04:56,045 --> 03:05:03,566
suit, as well, following behind them. At this point,
you are the tip of the spear of this assault at

1815
03:05:03,566 --> 03:05:09,541
this very moment. You begin to follow this
pattern, cross the pass, heading south-southeast,

1816
03:05:09,541 --> 03:05:15,324
heading over and through different mountain
ranges. The higher you get, the wind gets a little

1817
03:05:15,324 --> 03:05:20,266
more intense, and the cold begins to get more
biting. And J'mon dips down a bit to avoid having

1818
03:05:20,266 --> 03:05:27,503
to thrust you into this very dangerous
stratosphere. The light in this area is very close

1819
03:05:27,503 --> 03:05:32,006
to near dusk almost, with how much the sunlight is
blotted out by the cloud cover that has completely

1820
03:05:32,006 --> 03:05:35,124
consumed the skyline, from horizon to horizon, on
all sides.

1821
03:05:35,124 --> 03:05:41,570
MARISHA: I do a bit of a Gust spell ahead of us to
clear the path, give him a little more visual line

1822
03:05:41,570 --> 03:05:42,616
of sight.

1823
03:05:42,616 --> 03:05:49,300
MATT: "Thank you," you hear emanate from J'mon as
the cloud cover tends to spread a little bit and

1824
03:05:49,300 --> 03:06:00,514
give a little bit of a good view. You travel on
for about 25, 30 or so minutes before Vex, Vax,

1825
03:06:00,514 --> 03:06:10,768
and Keyleth, you glance around the bend of the
pass that you've just begun to curve around, and

1826
03:06:10,768 --> 03:06:21,324
you see it: an impossibly immense entity, standing
hundreds and hundreds of feet tall. A gigantic,

1827
03:06:21,324 --> 03:06:30,471
bulky mass of jagged rock, slowly walking on two
castle-width legs, each footfall sending a

1828
03:06:30,471 --> 03:06:37,305
cloud-spray of earth into the air around it.
(crashing) Quaking the surrounding lands with a

1829
03:06:37,305 --> 03:06:44,947
terrifying crack and rumble. As the back leg
lifts, sifting through the air, you can almost

1830
03:06:44,947 --> 03:06:52,590
hear the air tear with a high-pitched whine, even
at this distance, as its sheer mass and speed in

1831
03:06:52,590 --> 03:06:56,774
which it's cutting through, breaking the
atmosphere, slams down for its next step.

1832
03:06:56,774 --> 03:07:07,935
(crashing) As you get a better view, the closer
you get, it resembles the earth elemental form

1833
03:07:07,935 --> 03:07:15,890
you've seen Keyleth take many times, only
proportionally malformed, and terrifying on a

1834
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:25,683
scale you've never seen. Four colossal arms
swing from its torso, battering rams of shifting

1835
03:07:25,683 --> 03:07:37,380
stone, each over 150 feet wide. The closer you
get, Grog, you sense a faint vibration in the

1836
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:39,394
Titanstone Knuckles.

1837
03:07:39,394 --> 03:08:01,144
TRAVIS: Oh my fucking god. Just a note. These were
made from the heart of a felled titan. I don't

1838
03:08:01,144 --> 03:08:03,213
think it's that one.

1839
03:08:03,213 --> 03:08:05,143
LAURA: It could be! That one's dead!

1840
03:08:05,143 --> 03:08:08,280
TRAVIS: That was sarcasm, but yeah.

1841
03:08:08,280 --> 03:08:12,923
SAM: Are you going to take him, one on one?

1842
03:08:12,923 --> 03:08:15,252
LAURA: Does that mean you can beat him up from the
inside?

1843
03:08:15,252 --> 03:08:17,099
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, beat him up with his heart!

1844
03:08:17,099 --> 03:08:18,658
LAURA: Yeah!

1845
03:08:18,658 --> 03:08:26,466
TRAVIS: (stammering) Do I notice anything?

1846
03:08:26,466 --> 03:08:36,144
MATT: Not in particular. You clap, and it sounds
booming, as it would. The closer you get, you

1847
03:08:36,144 --> 03:08:42,413
sense this very faint vibration to them, as if
proximity keys you in, and even your simple

1848
03:08:42,413 --> 03:08:48,177
mind, Grog, can gather that these were crafted
and made from whatever it is you see storming

1849
03:08:48,177 --> 03:08:50,401
through that ravine.

1850
03:08:50,401 --> 03:08:52,984
TALIESIN: Okay.

1851
03:08:52,984 --> 03:08:58,473
LIAM: Do I feel Vecna riding on this guy's
shoulder?

1852
03:08:58,473 --> 03:09:07,660
MATT: You sense the direction and distance of
Vecna directly where this entity lies. I would

1853
03:09:07,660 --> 03:09:10,984
like you to make a perception check, please.

1854
03:09:10,984 --> 03:09:12,202
LAURA: Do a what?

1855
03:09:12,202 --> 03:09:21,332
MATT: Perception check. Just him for now as he's
focusing.

1856
03:09:21,332 --> 03:09:23,564
LIAM: 27.

1857
03:09:23,564 --> 03:09:27,587
MATT: You glance past as your proximity grows
closer and closer. One, you notice that there are

1858
03:09:27,587 --> 03:09:34,873
beehive-type activity around the top where its
head would be. There is no massive head

1859
03:09:34,873 --> 03:09:40,995
protruding, just the shoulder shelf where the top of it
becomes these four arms, and it's faced away from

1860
03:09:40,995 --> 03:09:47,036
you, facing the way it's traveling, its arms
swinging wildly with each step, slowly. Its size

1861
03:09:47,036 --> 03:09:55,096
is difficult for you to fathom at this distance.
It seems so big yet so small. As you get closer,

1862
03:09:55,096 --> 03:10:00,862
you can see these bee swarm-like clusters
resemble creatures you saw in the Shadowfell not

1863
03:10:00,862 --> 03:10:14,326
too long ago, and there atop the shelf of its
gargantuan torso, you see a cityline resting atop of

1864
03:10:14,326 --> 03:10:23,834
this entity. There lies a portion of Thar Amphala,
moving with this gargantuan primordial earth

1865
03:10:23,834 --> 03:10:36,525
titan, risen from below its long-held tomb.

1866
03:10:36,525 --> 03:10:43,812
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
us. It's not going to make any difference, but I'm

1867
03:10:43,812 --> 03:10:45,215
going to do it.

1868
03:10:45,215 --> 03:10:48,068
TALIESIN: Will that work on the back of a big
shiny dragon?

1869
03:10:48,068 --> 03:10:54,485
TRAVIS: Another note, to be clear, these were
carved from the heart stone of a ruined earth

1870
03:10:54,485 --> 03:11:01,597
primordial. When they're doing their thing, they
make me resistant to fire, cold, and lightning

1871
03:11:01,597 --> 03:11:05,591
damage. So. That's good.

1872
03:11:05,591 --> 03:11:17,183
MARISHA: Yeah. Theory time. Maybe. This primordial
is marching with Thar Amphala on its back to

1873
03:11:17,183 --> 03:11:25,208
Vasselheim. If I were a god, wanting to prove that
I'm awesome and do a big miracle thing, I would

1874
03:11:25,208 --> 03:11:27,860
drop a giant city on top of another city.

1875
03:11:27,860 --> 03:11:31,247
TRAVIS: Or destroy the city and replace it with
that one.

1876
03:11:31,247 --> 03:11:45,914
SAM: We can stop this, though. All we have to do
is beat the titan. I've got magic missiles that

1877
03:11:45,914 --> 03:11:50,061
can do 1d6 damage.

1878
03:11:50,061 --> 03:11:56,635
MATT: 1d4 plus one.

1879
03:11:56,635 --> 03:11:59,649
SAM: We could be in business!

1880
03:11:59,649 --> 03:12:04,491
TRAVIS: Listen. I know it seems really dire,
right? But the only other option besides attacking

1881
03:12:04,491 --> 03:12:09,572
it, in my mind, is trying to get its attention.
Maybe lead it away from Vasselheim.

1882
03:12:09,572 --> 03:12:14,210
TALIESIN: I think it's also, in theory, necrotic,
which means it can be turned.

1883
03:12:14,210 --> 03:12:19,750
LAURA: That would be one powerful fucking spell.

1884
03:12:19,750 --> 03:12:22,337
TALIESIN: We're going to have to do something.

1885
03:12:22,337 --> 03:12:26,043
LAURA: Pike, how strong are you feeling right
now?

1886
03:12:26,043 --> 03:12:30,913
MATT: You look back at Pike, who's clutching onto
the back of J'mon Sa Ord. Seeing this, her face

1887
03:12:30,913 --> 03:12:35,589
pale white, eyes wide. She's like, "I don't
know."

1888
03:12:35,589 --> 03:12:38,279
TRAVIS: It's all right, buddy!

1889
03:12:38,279 --> 03:12:40,214
LAURA: You got it. You're a monster!

1890
03:12:40,214 --> 03:12:50,779
MATT: (weakly) "I'm a monster! It's also a
monster!"

1891
03:12:50,779 --> 03:12:55,348
(laughter)

1892
03:12:55,348 --> 03:13:00,351
SAM: Should we land on the city on its back, or
should we try to fuck up the titan?

1893
03:13:00,351 --> 03:13:06,036
LAURA: I think we should dive into one of the
beehive tunnels and stealth in. I think <i>we</i>

1894
03:13:06,036 --> 03:13:12,585
should still be stealth mode. J'mon can drop us
off. J'mon, you distract all of the city with all

1895
03:13:12,585 --> 03:13:16,287
of your wyvern riders, as well, and we'll come in
from the bottom up, yeah?

1896
03:13:16,287 --> 03:13:22,702
MATT: "I think that is a very sound plan.
However," and as the dragon's head turns and looks

1897
03:13:22,702 --> 03:13:29,256
ahead, you can see some of these clusters of
gloomstalkers have broken away from the titan,

1898
03:13:29,256 --> 03:13:35,469
swarming in your direction. You're about, I'd say,
a mile and a half away from it and gaining, only

1899
03:13:35,469 --> 03:13:41,331
because you're pushing at full speed. You're
seeing now them breaking off into the clusters and

1900
03:13:41,331 --> 03:13:43,939
you hear the distant (screeching).

1901
03:13:43,939 --> 03:13:49,708
TRAVIS: I know we bamfed out here, but do we have
any idea how much time we have? How far away from

1902
03:13:49,708 --> 03:13:51,412
Vasselheim we are?

1903
03:13:51,412 --> 03:13:54,683
SAM: How far have we gone?

1904
03:13:54,683 --> 03:13:57,061
MATT: Fom what you can tell, make a--

1905
03:13:57,061 --> 03:14:00,735
TRAVIS: Don't make me make it. No, I'm ready.
Let's go!

1906
03:14:00,735 --> 03:14:02,974
LAURA: I'm going to guess, too, because he's
asking out loud.

1907
03:14:02,974 --> 03:14:04,607
MARISHA and TALIESIN: It's a good question.

1908
03:14:04,607 --> 03:14:06,034
MATT: Make a nature check.

1909
03:14:06,034 --> 03:14:11,632
MARISHA: Can I do it, too?

1910
03:14:11,632 --> 03:14:12,892
TRAVIS: Negative two!

1911
03:14:12,892 --> 03:14:17,982
(laughter)

1912
03:14:17,982 --> 03:14:24,639
TRAVIS: My modifier, my <i>modifier,</i> so 15. It was
17; I was excited.

1913
03:14:24,639 --> 03:14:34,398
MATT: Not too bad! You haven't traversed this area
of the north side of Issylra before, but gathering

1914
03:14:34,398 --> 03:14:41,841
based on where you were, seeing the sinkhole, and
the distance that Vax'ildan was giving you

1915
03:14:41,841 --> 03:14:47,696
earlier, you imagine it's probably about 200 miles
or so away from Vasselheim.

1916
03:14:47,696 --> 03:14:51,599
TRAVIS: Okay, we've got time. Not a lot.

1917
03:14:51,599 --> 03:14:54,247
MATT: It has a very wide gait with each step.

1918
03:14:54,247 --> 03:14:58,621
TRAVIS: But it's like Godzilla, right? It's like
(groaning, thud).

1919
03:14:58,621 --> 03:15:04,242
MATT: Yeah! So you have time, but it's not 200
miles on normal person feet.

1920
03:15:04,242 --> 03:15:06,025
TRAVIS: I mean, if he starts skipping, we're
fucked.

1921
03:15:06,025 --> 03:15:18,769
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth. Do you have any of that Wild
Guide-- is that what's it called? That herb that scares away

1922
03:15:18,769 --> 03:15:20,920
the undead.

1923
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:24,086
MARISHA: I do. Well, I grabbed some, so I can
cultivate more of it, yeah.

1924
03:15:24,086 --> 03:15:26,308
LAURA: You should probably do that.

1925
03:15:26,308 --> 03:15:29,819
LIAM: They're a mile and a half away, and they see
us, it looks like.

1926
03:15:29,819 --> 03:15:33,128
MATT: Yeah, they're closing in, there's a short
time before they reach you. Remember, at this

1927
03:15:33,128 --> 03:15:39,219
traveling speed, any sort of smoke-based censer
material is going to go right behind you like a flare.

1928
03:15:39,219 --> 03:15:46,367
LIAM: Can we turn into clouds, Keyleth, and fly
off of our dragon ride and poof inside the titan?

1929
03:15:46,367 --> 03:15:48,094
MARISHA: Let me see what I packed.

1930
03:15:48,094 --> 03:15:52,060
TRAVIS: We'd be in the air, and not all of us are
so awesome in the air.

1931
03:15:52,060 --> 03:15:57,427
LAURA: We could fall off this dragon's back real
fast.

1932
03:15:57,427 --> 03:16:13,347
MARISHA: Okay. We could do Wind Walk. It's going
to take a minute to transform in and out. I also

1933
03:16:13,347 --> 03:16:15,014
have Animal Shapes.

1934
03:16:15,014 --> 03:16:18,496
SAM: J'mon, can you become invisible, by any
chance?

1935
03:16:18,496 --> 03:16:32,443
MATT: J'mon, you hear the voice rumble, "I can,
but only myself. I could maybe affect a couple of you."

1936
03:16:32,443 --> 03:16:35,200
SAM: I could affect a couple of us.

1937
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:36,498
LAURA: How many?

1938
03:16:36,498 --> 03:16:38,913
SAM: Three.

1939
03:16:38,913 --> 03:16:49,328
LAURA: That leaves quite a few of us left. Maybe,
J'mon, could you get--

1940
03:16:49,328 --> 03:16:50,691
LIAM: Five?

1941
03:16:50,691 --> 03:16:52,943
MATT: "I could muster about four."

1942
03:16:52,943 --> 03:16:57,666
TRAVIS: That's enough. Three and four.

1943
03:16:57,666 --> 03:16:59,786
LIAM: Pike.

1944
03:16:59,786 --> 03:17:01,986
TRAVIS: I can't add.

1945
03:17:01,986 --> 03:17:13,214
SAM: Or! I could make J'mon look like one of those
dark flappy things and make us look like undead

1946
03:17:13,214 --> 03:17:14,231
creatures?

1947
03:17:14,231 --> 03:17:16,846
LAURA: They probably have seen us coming, though;
they're on their way here.

1948
03:17:16,846 --> 03:17:21,614
SAM: Yeah. Invisible, then?

1949
03:17:21,614 --> 03:17:24,716
TALIESIN: At least we're a smaller target, at that
point.

1950
03:17:24,716 --> 03:17:30,154
MARISHA: I can throw out a fog cloud and try and
fog us the rest of the way.

1951
03:17:30,154 --> 03:17:32,329
SAM: We'll fly through it; it won't work.

1952
03:17:32,329 --> 03:17:33,840
MARISHA: We're in clouds!

1953
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:36,336
SAM: If you do the thing, we'll keep going through
it.

1954
03:17:36,336 --> 03:17:40,662
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah. That's a good point.

1955
03:17:40,662 --> 03:17:44,215
TRAVIS: Invisible or change us. One or the other.

1956
03:17:44,215 --> 03:17:46,999
LIAM: You could do invisible and I could fly as
fast as I fucking can away.

1957
03:17:46,999 --> 03:17:51,154
MATT: (screeching) The cloud breaks ahead and you
watch as two gloomstalkers come diving down

1958
03:17:51,154 --> 03:17:53,405
towards the back of J'mon.

1959
03:17:53,405 --> 03:17:54,685
SAM: Let's do invisible!

1960
03:17:54,685 --> 03:17:57,124
LAURA: I shoot one with an arrow.

1961
03:17:57,124 --> 03:17:58,545
TALIESIN: I shoot the other one with a gun.

1962
03:17:58,545 --> 03:18:00,242
MATT: Both of you guys, roll attacks.

1963
03:18:00,242 --> 03:18:04,032
TALIESIN: It's okay. We're going at a speed that
it doesn't matter. Did that just happen?

1964
03:18:04,032 --> 03:18:05,969
SAM: Yeah, I just knocked over a wine bottle.

1965
03:18:05,969 --> 03:18:09,367
MATT and TRAVIS: A grape juice bottle.

1966
03:18:09,367 --> 03:18:10,422
LAURA: 28.

1967
03:18:10,422 --> 03:18:11,701
MATT: 28 hits.

1968
03:18:11,701 --> 03:18:16,509
TALIESIN: (counting) 25.

1969
03:18:16,509 --> 03:18:17,924
MATT: 25 hits, as well.

1970
03:18:17,924 --> 03:18:23,547
TALIESIN: I should have said this. I was going to
burn a grit to drop.

1971
03:18:23,547 --> 03:18:28,369
MATT: Right, I figured that was the case. One of
them gets shot with an arrow and as the impact

1972
03:18:28,369 --> 03:18:32,486
hits, it shrieks but continues its dive. The second
one gets shot by-- which weapon was it?

1973
03:18:32,486 --> 03:18:33,785
TALIESIN: Animus.

1974
03:18:33,785 --> 03:18:39,243
MATT: With Animus. You watch as the detonation of
the spray of black from the impact of the bullet

1975
03:18:39,243 --> 03:18:45,299
hitting. As it shrieks, its wings buckle from
underneath and it plummets about 30 or 40 feet or

1976
03:18:45,299 --> 03:18:50,266
so and falls out of its dive. The one, however,
is still diving and it's going to go for the one

1977
03:18:50,266 --> 03:19:00,256
that shot it with its arrow. Natural two. That's
going to be a 13. I'm pretty sure that doesn't hit you.

1978
03:19:00,256 --> 03:19:01,531
LAURA: No, that doesn't hit.

1979
03:19:01,531 --> 03:19:05,596
MATT: As it attempts to dive past you, you duck
out of the way, still nocking a secondary arrow.

1980
03:19:05,596 --> 03:19:11,238
Its claws hits the back of the dragon scales. You
hear the scrape of it going across the back, but

1981
03:19:11,238 --> 03:19:16,459
having no effect on the hard, armored brass
dragon's back. The gloomstalker then shrieks once

1982
03:19:16,459 --> 03:19:20,042
more and takes back up into the clouds and
vanishes.

1983
03:19:20,042 --> 03:19:22,515
LIAM: Did I get an attack of opportunity on it
with daggers?

1984
03:19:22,515 --> 03:19:24,759
MATT: You can definitely attack it with daggers,
if you'd like.

1985
03:19:24,759 --> 03:19:28,731
LIAM: Yeah, that hits. 29.

1986
03:19:28,731 --> 03:19:30,404
MATT: That hits.

1987
03:19:30,404 --> 03:19:33,147
LIAM: If my friend the dragon is against it, do I
get sneak attack?

1988
03:19:33,147 --> 03:19:36,664
MATT: No. Sorry.

1989
03:19:36,664 --> 03:19:40,470
LIAM: All right. That is 12 for that.

1990
03:19:40,470 --> 03:19:43,479
MATT: 12 damage. How much damage did you do?

1991
03:19:43,479 --> 03:19:44,663
LAURA: 15.

1992
03:19:44,663 --> 03:19:52,567
MATT: As it shrieks and vanishes back into the clouds
above, you can see now the wyvern riders around

1993
03:19:52,567 --> 03:19:59,647
are starting to charge in, as well. As you're rushing
now, you're maybe three-quarters of a mile from

1994
03:19:59,647 --> 03:20:01,724
the exterior of this giant earth titan.

1995
03:20:01,724 --> 03:20:03,076
LAURA: Invisible!

1996
03:20:03,076 --> 03:20:09,186
MATT: All right. You complete your incantation in
time with J'mon, and the entirety of your party

1997
03:20:09,186 --> 03:20:15,273
turns transparent and is now free from visual
perspective.

1998
03:20:15,273 --> 03:20:17,904
LIAM: Did we get everybody?

1999
03:20:17,904 --> 03:20:20,506
MATT: You did three?

2000
03:20:20,506 --> 03:20:22,997
SAM: I can do four if J'mon can't.

2001
03:20:22,997 --> 03:20:30,716
MATT: J'mon can do four. Well, Pike and J'mon
would be eight.

2002
03:20:30,716 --> 03:20:33,167
SAM: Okay, so we'll do four and four.

2003
03:20:33,167 --> 03:20:39,753
MATT: And with that, you all manage to disappear
and go into a dive. As soon as you all vanish,

2004
03:20:39,753 --> 03:20:43,744
which is interesting because you disappear, and
suddenly your mount disappears, and all your

2005
03:20:43,744 --> 03:20:48,502
friends disappear. So you're clutching on to what
you hope is still dragon scales and fur as you

2006
03:20:48,502 --> 03:20:56,133
look down and see clouds, ground, mountains, and
eventual, plummeting death, were you not holding

2007
03:20:56,133 --> 03:20:57,306
onto the back of the dragon.

2008
03:20:57,306 --> 03:20:59,778
TRAVIS: (screams)

2009
03:20:59,778 --> 03:21:04,013
TALIESIN: Wait, if our eyelids are invisible, does
that mean we can't even close our eyes?

2010
03:21:04,013 --> 03:21:05,897
MATT: You can close your eyes.

2011
03:21:05,897 --> 03:21:10,124
TALIESIN: No, it's too much. Too much. Not cool.

2012
03:21:10,124 --> 03:21:14,174
MATT: I will say, because the enchantment doesn't
make you translucent, just invisible to the visual

2013
03:21:14,174 --> 03:21:16,906
gaze, the interior of your eyelids would not be
affected by it.

2014
03:21:16,906 --> 03:21:20,016
TALIESIN: Okay. That's my worst nightmare.

2015
03:21:20,016 --> 03:21:23,012
MATT: Much like a Harry Potter invisibility cloak.
You can still see the inside of the cloak

2016
03:21:23,012 --> 03:21:24,081
somewhat.

2017
03:21:24,081 --> 03:21:26,179
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I was just having a Clockwork
Orange moment.

2018
03:21:26,179 --> 03:21:32,755
MARISHA: You make yourself more nauseous by
closing your eyes.

2019
03:21:32,755 --> 03:21:34,168
TALIESIN: That's not true.

2020
03:21:34,168 --> 03:21:37,932
MATT: As you go into this dive, you can hear the
clashing of wyvern against gloomstalker. You hear

2021
03:21:37,932 --> 03:21:44,411
the yelps and the shrieks of two different bestial
cries. You hear shouts of humanoid and elven

2022
03:21:44,411 --> 03:21:51,086
voices shouting as spears are tossed, arrows are
let loose, and this aerial fray begins. With that,

2023
03:21:51,086 --> 03:21:57,005
you glance forward as the dragon comes out of a
dive, J'mon leading you towards this gargantuan

2024
03:21:57,005 --> 03:22:12,436
entity. You can hear the further volume, the
(massive footsteps). Even slower than that,

2025
03:22:12,436 --> 03:22:18,248
probably, based on the gait it has to walk and the
speed it's going. It is like watching a mountain

2026
03:22:18,248 --> 03:22:22,397
with legs move. As you approach, what do you do?

2027
03:22:22,397 --> 03:22:25,296
SAM: Do we see a clearing? A landing spot?

2028
03:22:25,296 --> 03:22:32,167
MATT: You can make a perception check, guys. All
of you.

2029
03:22:32,167 --> 03:22:38,483
LAURA: 25.

2030
03:22:38,483 --> 03:22:40,277
MARISHA: 30.

2031
03:22:40,277 --> 03:22:41,301
TALIESIN: 24.

2032
03:22:41,301 --> 03:22:42,909
TRAVIS: Six.

2033
03:22:42,909 --> 03:22:45,096
SAM: Eight.

2034
03:22:45,096 --> 03:22:52,355
MATT: Eight, awesome. All right. Keyleth. You
guys, at this distance, it's hard to make out

2035
03:22:52,355 --> 03:22:57,175
details. But Keyleth, you rolled a 30, which
according to 5th Edition is nearly impossible as a

2036
03:22:57,175 --> 03:23:11,419
DC. So. You glance about and amongst the broken
rock exterior of this behemoth entity, you can see

2037
03:23:11,419 --> 03:23:19,759
towards the base of its right leg, towards the
back, a faint trickle of water, like a waterfall

2038
03:23:19,759 --> 03:23:32,172
of pee, probably. A trickling of a waterfall
that's flowing from its back leg area and then

2039
03:23:32,172 --> 03:23:34,023
dissipating as it plummets into the air.

2040
03:23:34,023 --> 03:23:36,201
MARISHA: That's it?

2041
03:23:36,201 --> 03:23:39,157
SAM: Is it coming from the city or coming from the
titan?

2042
03:23:39,157 --> 03:23:40,158
MATT: From the titan.

2043
03:23:40,158 --> 03:23:42,815
MARISHA: He's leaking from the back of his calf.

2044
03:23:42,815 --> 03:23:45,697
LAURA: Let's go in there, then.

2045
03:23:45,697 --> 03:23:48,135
MARISHA: From the back of his hip.

2046
03:23:48,135 --> 03:23:52,865
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can land on that burst
pimple, then.

2047
03:23:52,865 --> 03:24:00,945
MARISHA: I don't think there's any landing. I
think there's going to be-- yeah. But you know

2048
03:24:00,945 --> 03:24:02,863
what? Let's see what happens.

2049
03:24:02,863 --> 03:24:04,750
LAURA: Let's fly in close to that waterfall.

2050
03:24:04,750 --> 03:24:10,019
MATT: Okay, so you point this out to J'mon? All
right. You hear the dragon voice boom up once

2051
03:24:10,019 --> 03:24:18,091
more. "Hold on!" Goes into an intense dive trying
to bring-- because previously you were about level,

2052
03:24:18,091 --> 03:24:22,499
if not a little higher than Thar Amphala on the
top of the entity. J'mon goes into a dive towards

2053
03:24:22,499 --> 03:24:28,037
the hip area that you point out. The wind is
pushing past you. You're holding on for dear life

2054
03:24:28,037 --> 03:24:31,436
because any possible loss of grip not only is
going to loose you from the dragon, which is going

2055
03:24:31,436 --> 03:24:40,430
to be hard to find you, as you're all invisible,
depending on the dragon's abilities, I guess. But

2056
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:45,296
as you begin to push down into this dive, I want
you all to make strength saving throws, please.

2057
03:24:45,296 --> 03:24:50,540
LAURA: Oh god, strength? Jeez Louise.

2058
03:24:50,540 --> 03:24:52,382
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2059
03:24:52,382 --> 03:24:59,459
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

2060
03:24:59,459 --> 03:25:03,447
(cheering)

2061
03:25:03,447 --> 03:25:09,705
(groaning)

2062
03:25:09,705 --> 03:25:12,296
SAM: I got an 11.

2063
03:25:12,296 --> 03:25:21,554
LIAM: I'm using my first Luck of the day. Oh,
that's worse. That is a nine for me.

2064
03:25:21,554 --> 03:25:27,167
LAURA: God. A 22 for me. I know!

2065
03:25:27,167 --> 03:25:32,504
MARISHA: This is a group success or failure thing,
right?

2066
03:25:32,504 --> 03:25:39,563
MATT: In almost a poetic justice way, both Vax and
Keyleth begin to lose their grip, and with a

2067
03:25:39,563 --> 03:25:46,632
sequence of moments, they both get blown off the
back of the brass dragon.

2068
03:25:46,632 --> 03:25:51,121
LAURA: We wouldn't even know. Were they touching
each other? Tell me they were.

2069
03:25:51,121 --> 03:25:57,592
MATT: You and Vax are currently now, no grip on
any dragon.

2070
03:25:57,592 --> 03:25:59,229
MARISHA: Vax! Whisper!

2071
03:25:59,229 --> 03:26:02,464
LIAM: I throw my dagger at that sound.

2072
03:26:02,464 --> 03:26:04,263
MATT: Roll an attack.

2073
03:26:04,263 --> 03:26:09,386
MARISHA: Wait, what?

2074
03:26:09,386 --> 03:26:11,989
TRAVIS: That sounds like us.

2075
03:26:11,989 --> 03:26:19,166
LIAM: Were you saying you were going to come to me?
There's the 18!

2076
03:26:19,166 --> 03:26:22,291
MATT: With disadvantage, because she is
invisible.

2077
03:26:22,291 --> 03:26:23,973
LIAM: That's a 20.

2078
03:26:23,973 --> 03:26:26,306
MATT: What's your armor class, Keyleth?

2079
03:26:26,306 --> 03:26:27,708
MARISHA: He hits.

2080
03:26:27,708 --> 03:26:30,913
LAURA: Good, so you can bamf to her.

2081
03:26:30,913 --> 03:26:38,691
LIAM: That's right. 12 plus psychic damage,
honey.

2082
03:26:38,691 --> 03:26:42,009
SAM: You guys have a fucked-up relationship.

2083
03:26:42,009 --> 03:26:46,838
MARISHA: Our entire relationship has been psychic
damage, baby.

2084
03:26:46,838 --> 03:26:58,356
LIAM: 14.

2085
03:26:58,356 --> 03:27:03,565
MATT: So you take 14 points of piercing damage.
However, as soon as the pain hits you, it's

2086
03:27:03,565 --> 03:27:08,344
immediately allayed by the impact of Vax's arms
wrapping around you for dear life.

2087
03:27:08,344 --> 03:27:11,814
MARISHA: (sputtering)

2088
03:27:11,814 --> 03:27:13,604
LIAM: I'm kissing you already.

2089
03:27:13,604 --> 03:27:18,106
MATT: You both are now tumbling and plummeting
through the sky.

2090
03:27:18,106 --> 03:27:20,475
LIAM: Do you want to fly, or should I?

2091
03:27:20,475 --> 03:27:23,245
MARISHA: Hold on! And I go giant eagle form.

2092
03:27:23,245 --> 03:27:30,576
MATT: Okay. The giant eagle form takes flight. As
her wings extend, you realize you've been

2093
03:27:30,576 --> 03:27:36,455
clutching on to the under down feathers. As soon
as the form takes, you grasp hold and climb back

2094
03:27:36,455 --> 03:27:46,746
onto the top of the giant eagle. With that, you
both (whooshing). Now, here's an interesting

2095
03:27:46,746 --> 03:27:52,485
question, because invisibility lasts until you do
an attack or cast a spell. It's a magical ability,

2096
03:27:52,485 --> 03:27:55,418
I'm going to say that because it's a natural
effect, it will not affect the invisibility,

2097
03:27:55,418 --> 03:28:00,224
especially because you're at a high enough druid
level. Specifically, shape changing is your thing.

2098
03:28:00,224 --> 03:28:06,355
So I'll say you skirt under what would reveal
invisibility. You lose it, however, for attacking

2099
03:28:06,355 --> 03:28:14,719
her. So now there's a Vax huddled on nothing,
full-on Wonder Woman-style invisible jet, riding

2100
03:28:14,719 --> 03:28:29,198
through the sky. So as you guys coast in, the rest
of you hear J'mon go, "It appears we've lost some

2101
03:28:29,198 --> 03:28:30,701
"passengers."

2102
03:28:30,701 --> 03:28:36,585
MARISHA: No! Keep going! (cawing) Tell them! Keep
going!

2103
03:28:36,585 --> 03:28:45,908
LIAM: We're all right. Everything's fine here.
Everything's fine. How are you?

2104
03:28:45,908 --> 03:28:54,219
SAM: J'mon, they say they're okay. It's okay, we
can go.

2105
03:28:54,219 --> 03:29:01,600
MATT: "Very well." Continues into the dive. You
guys are trailing behind at this point, but making

2106
03:29:01,600 --> 03:29:07,712
your way down towards the hip region of this
entity, following the direction that Keyleth gave

2107
03:29:07,712 --> 03:29:15,598
at her spotting earlier. As you guys get closer
and closer, you can see there is indeed a

2108
03:29:15,598 --> 03:29:22,190
trickle of a waterfall that is dissipating, the
wind is so strong that it gets maybe 25 or 30 feet

2109
03:29:22,190 --> 03:29:24,544
down before it gets scattered into droplets.

2110
03:29:24,544 --> 03:29:26,416
SAM: Is it pee-colored?

2111
03:29:26,416 --> 03:29:32,661
MATT: No, it is actually pretty clear water. You
do also glance, as you get closer, it appears to

2112
03:29:32,661 --> 03:29:35,412
be emerging from some sort of an opening, like a
cavern entrance.

2113
03:29:35,412 --> 03:29:36,992
LAURA: Yeah, let's head for the opening.

2114
03:29:36,992 --> 03:29:42,100
MATT: So as you approach--

2115
03:29:42,100 --> 03:29:47,470
LAURA: We have Pass Without a Trace!

2116
03:29:47,470 --> 03:30:01,851
MATT: You do, but the flying man does not. So as
the rest of you make it up towards the side, and

2117
03:30:01,851 --> 03:30:06,334
the wind is strong here, you can hear the impact
of each footfall, so deafening your eardrums

2118
03:30:06,334 --> 03:30:14,611
almost shake and are in pain with each impact, the
bass of each footfall is immense. But you do see,

2119
03:30:14,611 --> 03:30:20,342
interestingly enough, there is the waterfall
coming out of it. The waterfall is careening down

2120
03:30:20,342 --> 03:30:31,525
a broken stone staircase. The opening is about
15 feet across and about ten feet wide. It

2121
03:30:31,525 --> 03:30:37,400
looks like it was at some point attached, before
this creature arose, to another series of tunnels

2122
03:30:37,400 --> 03:30:41,965
or wherever else this dwarven stronghold, this
series of vaults that were carved within this

2123
03:30:41,965 --> 03:30:49,594
creature's body, extended beyond its torso. This
is one of the breaking points. As you glance back,

2124
03:30:49,594 --> 03:30:55,770
you can see your brother coasting down about a
hundred or so feet away. You also watch as one of

2125
03:30:55,770 --> 03:30:58,672
the large arms swings back.

2126
03:30:58,672 --> 03:31:00,432
LAURA: No!

2127
03:31:00,432 --> 03:31:02,959
MARISHA: I dodge it! I try and dodge it!

2128
03:31:02,959 --> 03:31:10,442
MATT: I need both of you guys to make dexterity
saving throws. Actually, because you're riding

2129
03:31:10,442 --> 03:31:14,341
Keyleth right now, it's going to be on the giant
eagle form, because you're clutching it.

2130
03:31:14,341 --> 03:31:15,888
MARISHA: It's just on me?

2131
03:31:15,888 --> 03:31:21,943
MATT: It's just on you. It's hard to avoid a
hundred-plus-foot-wide arm.

2132
03:31:21,943 --> 03:31:33,120
LIAM: This is a save? Wait. This is a dex save,
right? I'm blessing Keyleth.

2133
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:36,807
MATT: As you see it coming? I'll say you have the
time because it's so immense.

2134
03:31:36,807 --> 03:31:43,014
MARISHA: Add a d4, yeah? Four, yeah! Okay, 24
total!

2135
03:31:43,014 --> 03:32:05,394
MATT: That's not enough. You were one away. It's a
25 DC because this is a giant fucking arm! Both

2136
03:32:05,394 --> 03:32:18,549
you and Vax-- I don't have the dice for this, so
I'm going to have to use the app. You both suffer

2137
03:32:18,549 --> 03:32:29,917
87 points of bludgeoning damage as the force of a
mountain slams into the side of your half-elf and

2138
03:32:29,917 --> 03:32:36,337
eagle form.

2139
03:32:36,337 --> 03:32:38,546
MARISHA: You said 87?

2140
03:32:38,546 --> 03:32:40,481
MATT: 87 points of bludgeoning damage, yes.

2141
03:32:40,481 --> 03:32:47,146
MARISHA: Okay. I immediately drop form and start
falling.

2142
03:32:47,146 --> 03:32:50,303
MATT: Okay, any carryover damage, make sure to
mark that.

2143
03:32:50,303 --> 03:32:53,614
LIAM: Does Uncanny Dodge affect this at all?

2144
03:32:53,614 --> 03:33:00,977
MATT: Unfortunately, because you were relying on
her eagle maneuverability, no.

2145
03:33:00,977 --> 03:33:05,063
LIAM: Okay. Well then, I shoot the wings out
immediately.

2146
03:33:05,063 --> 03:33:12,372
MATT: Okay. The wings emerge as both of you begin
to plummet at this point.

2147
03:33:12,372 --> 03:33:14,796
MARISHA: I'm okay.

2148
03:33:14,796 --> 03:33:23,294
MATT: Keyleth? As you're plummeting, Vax, I need
you to roll a perception check.

2149
03:33:23,294 --> 03:33:41,143
SAM: J'mon, they're fine. They told us they're
fine! They'll be here any second! Don't worry.

2150
03:33:41,143 --> 03:33:44,165
TALIESIN: We did see this happen, right?

2151
03:33:44,165 --> 03:33:50,766
MATT: You guys are right now hovering by this and
looking back. You watch this occur. You see Vax

2152
03:33:50,766 --> 03:34:00,013
get smacked, fall, and then his wings shoot out.
Vax, roll a perception check. With disadvantage.

2153
03:34:00,013 --> 03:34:08,762
TALIESIN: Roll really high, twice.

2154
03:34:08,762 --> 03:34:15,855
LIAM: I rolled the same thing, so it's a 24.
Reliable talent.

2155
03:34:15,855 --> 03:34:23,810
MATT: Strangely, you're able to see a slight shift
in wind to give you a brief moment to see where

2156
03:34:23,810 --> 03:34:27,396
Keyleth's invisible, plummeting body is.

2157
03:34:27,396 --> 03:34:29,531
MARISHA: Oh, I'm still invisible as I'm falling.

2158
03:34:29,531 --> 03:34:36,737
MATT: Yeah, because you haven't cast a spell or
any attacks. So you manage to see this brief

2159
03:34:36,737 --> 03:34:42,864
shimmer in space where the wind bends around her
reverting form.

2160
03:34:42,864 --> 03:34:44,981
LIAM: I pick it up, grab it.

2161
03:34:44,981 --> 03:34:50,039
MATT: You thrust downward with your wings. You
grab her body and manage to carry. You can feel

2162
03:34:50,039 --> 03:34:54,292
her invisible body below you as you bring it back
up.

2163
03:34:54,292 --> 03:34:56,192
LIAM: Punch me in the face. Punch me in the face
right now!

2164
03:34:56,192 --> 03:34:57,424
MARISHA: (yelling)

2165
03:34:57,424 --> 03:35:00,617
LIAM: Hey, beautiful.

2166
03:35:00,617 --> 03:35:02,229
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

2167
03:35:02,229 --> 03:35:04,815
LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here! Do a barrel
roll.

2168
03:35:04,815 --> 03:35:19,878
MATT: All right. Another giant arm swings, but
swings wide as it attempts to swing in the same

2169
03:35:19,878 --> 03:35:25,266
place it did before. It does not seem to see the
two of you quickly approach the proximity of its

2170
03:35:25,266 --> 03:35:32,307
torso. You hear this (zooming) passing over you by
about 30 or 40 feet.

2171
03:35:32,307 --> 03:35:35,384
MARISHA: Oh, trying to go for J'mon?

2172
03:35:35,384 --> 03:35:43,530
MATT: No, trying to go where you guys were. You
still have a visual point on it, so you direct and

2173
03:35:43,530 --> 03:35:47,049
tug Vax by the hair and ears in the direction of
the path you saw.

2174
03:35:47,049 --> 03:35:48,953
MARISHA: By the ponytail.

2175
03:35:48,953 --> 03:36:03,895
MATT: Yeah, basically. And there, on the edge, you
can see J'mon Sa Ord there, wings flapping, as you

2176
03:36:03,895 --> 03:36:08,500
guys rocket down and land right on the edge of the
footsteps. There's about a five-foot gap where the

2177
03:36:08,500 --> 03:36:10,413
water isn't rushing past.

2178
03:36:10,413 --> 03:36:15,676
MARISHA: Okay. I immediately cast Control Water
and suck it inside.

2179
03:36:15,676 --> 03:36:25,927
MATT: Okay. The waterfall stops and bends upward
and is now being held. You guys have a row of

2180
03:36:25,927 --> 03:36:29,962
steps ahead of you that are safe enough to land on
right now. They're still slick with water, but

2181
03:36:29,962 --> 03:36:32,679
there isn't a rushing waterfall pouring over
them.

2182
03:36:32,679 --> 03:36:34,861
LAURA: Can we see where to go to? An opening?

2183
03:36:34,861 --> 03:36:36,837
MATT: You can see it ascends upward out of view.

2184
03:36:36,837 --> 03:36:38,752
LAURA: Let's just go.

2185
03:36:38,752 --> 03:36:41,412
TALIESIN: This is what's happening. This is who we
are now.

2186
03:36:41,412 --> 03:36:50,389
MATT: J'mon, they swoop down and the giant dragon
claws (clattering) grapple onto the rock side of

2187
03:36:50,389 --> 03:36:57,382
this large titan and leans forward, giving each of
you the opportunity to jump a very short distance

2188
03:36:57,382 --> 03:37:06,582
over to these steps. As each of you make this
leap, J'mon disengages and flies up and says, "I

2189
03:37:06,582 --> 03:37:12,824
"can only grant you so much, for I have many to
watch out here as we distract he who resides

2190
03:37:12,824 --> 03:37:20,627
"above. However, take this." As the dragon head
descends, you see the eyes flare with energy as

2191
03:37:20,627 --> 03:37:46,701
they cast Mass Cure Wounds. Ooh, two sixes and a
seven, not bad. All right, 12, 19. That's going to

2192
03:37:46,701 --> 03:37:51,925
be 28 hit points healed to both of you.

2193
03:37:51,925 --> 03:37:53,674
TALIESIN: That helps.

2194
03:37:53,674 --> 03:38:01,901
LIAM: Yeah, as we were landing, the gashes all
over Vax's face started to heal up a little bit,

2195
03:38:01,901 --> 03:38:04,683
but not all the way. Then suddenly they went even
further.

2196
03:38:04,683 --> 03:38:13,224
MATT: "Be safe, and I'll see you on the other
side."

2197
03:38:13,224 --> 03:38:19,185
LAURA: (fake-crying) See you on the other side of
the war.

2198
03:38:19,185 --> 03:38:27,197
MATT: As you all stand on the precipice of this
opening that falls off into a drop, hundreds of

2199
03:38:27,197 --> 03:38:33,617
feet to the rocky ground below, you can smell the
cold wind blowing through these caverns, emerging

2200
03:38:33,617 --> 03:38:38,433
from this entrance you've found. As Keyleth holds
back the flow of this river, you glance up the

2201
03:38:38,433 --> 03:38:45,210
dark, rising stairs, deep into the body of the
titan amongst the cursed vaults of this dwarven

2202
03:38:45,210 --> 03:38:53,664
city, long abandoned, and begin your trek to
eventually meet your final conflict with the

2203
03:38:53,664 --> 03:38:56,214
Whispered One. That's where we're going to end
tonight's game.

2204
03:38:56,214 --> 03:40:14,377
(extended cheering)

2205
03:40:14,377 --> 03:40:15,792
BRIAN: Keep it up!

2206
03:40:15,792 --> 03:40:17,446
MATT: This is a little surreal.

2207
03:40:17,446 --> 03:40:26,364
BRIAN: Big time. There's some people that we
really want to thank really fast. It's our crew,

2208
03:40:26,364 --> 03:40:36,827
and it's the people who helped put this on for us.
So we want to thank-- I had the list but I left it

2209
03:40:36,827 --> 03:40:47,140
backstage because I was too involved in what was
going on. Okay. Dani, Sax, Courtney, Ryan, Rachel,

2210
03:40:47,140 --> 03:41:05,453
Ed, Jamie, Danny, Ben, Chris, Fernando, Audrey.
You guys. It takes literally six months to put one

2211
03:41:05,453 --> 03:41:13,298
of these on. The amount of work and heart and love
that our crew has put into this has been

2212
03:41:13,298 --> 03:41:18,868
incredible. You guys are incredible!

2213
03:41:18,868 --> 03:41:47,456
(cheering)

2214
03:41:47,456 --> 03:41:53,160
BRIAN: Thank you for waiting, thank you for
coming, thank you for participating! Don't worry,

2215
03:41:53,160 --> 03:41:59,067
it's almost Thursday. Good night, GenCon!

2216
03:41:59,067 --> 03:42:35,279

SAM: See you guys tomorrow. Get some sleep. Thanks
so much; this was a lot of fun!

2218
03:42:46,787 --> 03:42:59,162
MATT: So just a reminder, guys, those of you who
will be able to come to the signing tomorrow,

2219
03:42:59,162 --> 03:43:02,335
we'll see you there. If you can come at least to
pick up some Scanlan stickers, I think it'll be

2220
03:43:02,335 --> 03:43:13,629
worth your while. I'm going to post some images of
what they look like. I think you'll be happy. It's

2221
03:43:13,629 --> 03:43:20,532
high time you got the fuck out and went to sleep.
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

2222
03:43:20,581 --> 03:43:23,213
TALIESIN: What time is the signing? That's
actually a real question.

2223
03:43:23,213 --> 03:43:34,058
MATT: Sorry, trigger warning on that question. Oh,
the signing is at 2:30, looks like, begins at

2224
03:43:34,058 --> 03:43:38,688
2:30. Yeah, ticket says 3:00?

2225
03:43:38,688 --> 03:43:44,455
BRIAN: Lucas Oil Field Stadium.

2226
03:43:44,455 --> 03:43:49,237
MATT: (singing) My schedule is wrong! (speaking)
Pay attention to Geek and Sundry's Twitter for

2227
03:43:49,237 --> 03:43:53,233
announcements. Anyway, thank you so much for
coming. Hope you had fun. We had a great time.

2228

2229
03:44:02,530 --> 03:44:05,593
TALIESIN: No, don't touch that!

2230
03:44:05,593 --> 03:44:09,885
MATT: You don't know what you've done.

2231
03:44:09,885 --> 03:44:15,160
BRIAN: I hope you brought two gallons of hand
sanitizer with you.

2232
03:44:15,160 --> 03:44:21,578
MATT: We love you guys. Good night.
