2
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:24,393
SAM: -- about the company itself who
so kindly sponsors us and about their founder,

3
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:34,055
one Ebenezer Lootacrata. Born on a silk-worm farm
in Budapest in 1919, Ebenezer Lootacrata was a

4
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:40,550
unique child. His siblings-- Claudrica, Piterca,
Dominocos, and Bob-- would always play checkers,

5
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,283
but Ebenezer was fascinated by the box they came
in. In fact, he was obsessed with boxes.

6
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:52,711
Did he wear briefs? No, boxers. He traded in his
backpack for a backbox. He wouldn't eat jelly from

7
00:19:52,711 --> 00:20:00,767
jars. He scooped it out of a large pine jelly box.
Dick-in-a-box? He invented that in 1930.

8
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:07,806
And in 1937 he packed up everything that was
special to him-- one shirt, one sticker, one comic

9
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:15,942
book, and one toy-- placed them in a crate and set
off for college. One day later, he was expelled

10
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:24,697
from college because he did not own pants.
But he had a vision! A revolutionary idea!

11
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:29,768
Before, people had boxes and people had cool
stuff, but he dared to put the cool stuff inside

12
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:39,485
the boxes! He named his company "Lootacrata".
In America we bastardize it as Loot Crate,

13
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:43,239
but history has never been the same.

14
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,361
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Very informative.

15
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:50,863
SAM: And you guys should know that you should go
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Promo code this

16
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:55,279
week, to celebrate the arrival of Taryon
Darrington to Critical Role, please use code

17
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:03,362
"Tary", that's T-A-R-Y, for 10% off your first
month's order. We at Loot Crate welcome Taryon

18
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,791
Darrington and look forward to his adventures.
He totally isn't the worst. Definitely not the

19
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:14,027
worst character to ever appear on Critical Role.
Actually, we've changed our mind.

20
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,705
Please use the code "criticalrole".

21
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,839
(all laugh)

22
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,314
TRAVIS: Do you know how many people are going to
go to their website and enter in "Taryon".

23
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,961
They're like "What the fuck!?" "Code not
received."

24
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,123
MARISHA: It's an ARG, I know it!

25
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:26,019
MATT: Exactly.

26
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,202
TALIESIN: It's perfect. They'll enter 'Tary' and
be disappointed.

27
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:29,566
MATT: Tary's the new Sombra.

28
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:31,736
(all laugh)

29
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:33,829
MARISHA: My subscription went up three dollars?
Aw.

30
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:38,046
(all laugh)

31
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,526
MATT: Hey, at least it's in character.

32
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:40,648
MARISHA: Worse.

33
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:48,069
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Appreciate it. All righty,
so, a number of us, if the weather is with us-- as

34
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:52,454
a giant storm apparently just blew into the west
coast-- are intending to fly out tomorrow to Anime

35
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,774
Milwaukee. So it'll be me and Marisha--

36
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:55,816
TRAVIS: Wisconsin!

37
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:56,637
MATT: Yes!

38
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:57,658
MARISHA: It's gonna be cold.

39
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:01,263
MATT: It's gonna be cold. With Travis, Laura,
myself, and Marisha will be out there along with

40
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:05,758
a bunch of other awesome guests, so hopefully
we'll see you guys there very soon. Also,

41
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:12,571
as far as the merch goes, apparently we're out of
dice! Right? We're out of dice. Dice are gone.

42
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:15,735
LAURA: We even ordered a lot this time, but we're
out.

43
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,227
SAM: But what will the people do? What will they
roll?

44
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:22,766
LAURA: Well, maybe they'll roll something extra
special later. I don't know.

45
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,559
TALIESIN: (laughs)

46
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,000
MATT: You speak like you know what you're talking
about.

47
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,556
TRAVIS: What a tease. What a tease.

48
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,715
SAM: You have no idea.

49
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:43,029
LAURA: We do still have bracelets. We do still
have pins. We do still have a few socks left.

50
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,606
We still have shirts!

51
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,761
TALIESIN: The Gilmore shirt is back--

52
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:51,561
LAURA: We have Gilmore shirts. We have a few-- We
have Strongjaw shirts! Are you wearing yours?

53
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:52,309
TRAVIS: Nope.

54
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,065
LAURA: No.

55
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:54,802
MATT: (laughs)

56
00:22:54,802 --> 00:23:00,001
LAURA: There's our Critical Role logo shirt! All
these shirts are still available in the store!

57
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,189
LIAM: He's wearing it on his face. That's
Strongjaw.

58
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,930
LAURA: This is Strong-- this is a strong jaw.

59
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,314
LIAM: Wears it every day.

60
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:08,737
TALIESIN: You should work in radio.

61
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,185
TRAVIS: They don't want me.

62
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,474
LAURA: That's all I got.

63
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,066
MATT: No worries. Thank you, Laura. Marisha,
do you want to talk about Signal Boost? I guess

64
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,668
Amy Dallen just had her run, right?

65
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:23,254
MARISHA: Yeah! Amy Dallen had her episode.
It's great. This week is Eric Campbell coming up

66
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:28,554
in the run. And you should go-- (airhorn noises)--
and you should go watch 'em.

67
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:29,796
LAURA: We gotta stop.

68
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:34,017
MARISHA: Yeah, where does that end? Once you
stop-- once you pop you just don't stop-- oh god,

69
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,344
now it's a Pringles reference. Okay, go watch
Signal Boost!

70
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,307
MATT: (laughs) Well done!

71
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:39,530
SAM: And eat Pringles.

72
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,102
(all laugh)

73
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:44,229
MARISHA: Not boosted on the Signal Boost.
But could be!

74
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:47,504
MATT: Indeed. (In Scottish accent) And there's a
new thing called Wednesday Club. You want to talk

75
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:51,617
about that? What's that about, Taliesin? Tell us
about that!

76
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:57,740
TALIESIN: For anybody who reads comic books
normally, you know that Wednesdays is when comic

77
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,364
books get released at comic book stores all across
the country. And if you're a big comic book nerd--

78
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:07,329
and you had a really fun comic book store-- you
would go on a Wednesday night and hang out with

79
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:11,216
all the other comic book nerds and have
six-week-long conversations on who would win in a

80
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,476
fight, Superman or Thor.

81
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:14,503
SAM: Thor.

82
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,653
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Superman.

83
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,328
TALIESIN: Actually, funny enough. You don't go to
a Wednesday Club, so you--

84
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,371
SAM: Thor's a god.

85
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,267
TALIESIN: Well, now you have a show to watch.
So now that I don't really have time to do that

86
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:27,053
any more, we thought it would be fun to just do it
here with all of our comic book nerds, so Amy

87
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:32,449
Dallen and Matt Key and I are going to be talking
comics every Wednesday from noon to two on the

88
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:33,945
Twitch stream and we're going to--

89
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,199
LAURA: Yay!

90
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,213
TALIESIN: Yay!

91
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:36,945
MARISHA: New shows!

92
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:42,100
TALIESIN: New show! The Wednesday Club, and we're
going to try and make it fun to watch, and easy if

93
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:46,236
you've not picked up a book in ages and you've
maybe thought about getting into comics,

94
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:50,340
or you had some kids and now the comic books have
just turned into giant shreds of paper.

95
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,865
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not a news show.

96
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,495
TALIESIN: We're not talking news. We're just
talking fun, cool comic book facts, and our first

97
00:24:55,495 --> 00:25:00,086
episode is going to be "Origin Stories" were we
talk about why we got into comic books, and then

98
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:05,121
starting the week after we're going to be talking
about cool characters, team-ups, classic runs of

99
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,650
books, anything and everything. It's going to be
great.

100
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,768
TRAVIS: Crossovers?

101
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:12,339
TALIESIN: No crossovers. Never mention
crossovers.

102
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,433
SAM: Special guests?

103
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,764
TALIESIN: Special guests! We will have special
guests and not-so-special guests-- you can come,

104
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:21,000
too. So yes! Wednesday Club, we'll be talking
about comic books! It's going to be great!

105
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,097
LAURA: Yaaay!

106
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:23,071
LIAM: So exciting!

107
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:23,884
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin.

108
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:24,812
TALIESIN: Check us out on Wednesday.

109
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:26,308
MATT: Also, there's a game called For Honor that
just came out

110
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:28,342
that a couple of you assholes are in.

111
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:30,937
LIAM: Oh, it's on the shelves, we've been playing
it for weeks here!

112
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:31,763
TRAVIS: Yeah!

113
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:36,560
LIAM: You can play it as well if you go to your
local shop or download it or get it at a store--I

114
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,749
already said that but you can play samurais-- we
have no samurais here. You can play knights--

115
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,371
Hey!-- or you can play Vikings-- you can use this
guy!

116
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,704
TRAVIS: Buuhh, Vikings!

117
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:46,640
LAURA: What kind of Viking are you?

118
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,387
TRAVIS: (loud belch) The male raider.

119
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,321
LAURA: The raider.

120
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:52,664
TRAVIS: It comes out Tuesday, February 14th on all
gaming platforms.

121
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:53,433
LAURA: That's yesterday.

122
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:54,360
MATT: That was two days ago.

123
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,235
TRAVIS: It's Valentine's Day-- I didn't...
miss...

124
00:25:57,235 --> 00:26:00,319
(all laugh)

125
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,718
LAURA: Our Valentine's Day consisted of me making
chili and then us going to Menchie's.

126
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:05,898
TRAVIS: And farting a lot.

127
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:06,695
LAURA: Yup!

128
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:07,488
MATT: There ya go!

129
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,040
LAURA: It was a gooood Valentine's Day.

130
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,198
TALIESIN: It's good chili, to be fair.

131
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,451
MATT: You got out of the house, though.

132
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:13,015
TRAVIS: That's true.

133
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:16,350
MARISHA: We watched Jurassic World and Suicide
Squad.

134
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,744
TRAVIS: You did both of those?

135
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,305
MARISHA: We wanted to get caught up on our,
like--

136
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:20,355
MATT: Bad movies.

137
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:21,528
MARISHA: -- questionably bad movies.

138
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:22,508
TRAVIS: That's a bunch of stank.

139
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:23,180
MATT and LAURA: Yeah.

140
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,891
MATT: No, we had to sit quietly for an hour
afterward, just to take it all in.

141
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,864
MARISHA: My favorite is Rick Flag just shouting
exposition

142
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:30,511
through Suicide Squad and that's his purpose.

143
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:31,505
TRAVIS: Yeah.

144
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:35,182
MATT: Including Katana's needless arrival--
Anyway! This is not this night's game of D&amp;D.

145
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:37,195
TALIESIN: I went to Underworld and met some
Critters, it was good.

146
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,017
MATT: That's awesome!

147
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,373
MARISHA: Oh! That's a better Valentine's Day.

148
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:44,381
LIAM: You know, honestly, you two having the time
to sit down and watch two bad movies--

149
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:45,098
TRAVIS: Here it comes.

150
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,594
LIAM: When I don't have time to watch one good
movie--

151
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:48,263
LAURA: Here we go. Here we go.

152
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:50,823
LIAM: -- is offensive. That is offensive to me.

153
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:52,657
TRAVIS: You have the joy of children in your
life!

154
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:53,363
MARISHA: Yeah!

155
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,236
LAURA: That's right.

156
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,126
TRAVIS: The beacons of hope in life. Of future
generations.

157
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,908
(all laugh)

158
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,328
MARISHA: You have spawn.

159
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,528
LAURA: Gulp gulp gulp gulp!

160
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:01,846
TRAVIS: He's so thirsty! He's just dehydrated.

161
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:05,325
MARISHA: They'll be holding your hand, you know,
in later years.

162
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,750
LIAM: It will help me when I'm dying. That is
true--

163
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,096
TALIESIN: Pushing you slowly off the edge.

164
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:08,979
MATT: Yes.

165
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:13,574
We're just gonna be somewhere in a forest,
lost, screaming to each other, Help!

166
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,986
So that's our future.

167
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:19,772
LIAM: I guess it's time to climb this mountain and
throw myself off.

168
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,660
TRAVIS: That's a good way to go.

169
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,764
MATT: Cultural heritage of ours.

170
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:28,010
MARISHA: This is my child. This's what I've
accomplished.

171
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:37,093
MATT: Last but not least, quick little note,
due to the current difficulties with green cards

172
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:43,828
and people that are in the country who weren't
born here, one of our fantastic crew members,

173
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,320
Amandine, unfortunately is having to leave and go
back to Switzerland. This is her last episode of

174
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,131
Critical Role. She's been a tremendously amazing
member of our team, and we've loved having her

175
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:59,773
here, and we certainly know this is not the last
we'll see of her, but this'll be her last show for

176
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:02,668
awhile, so I just wanted to bring her out and say
hi to the community real fast.

177
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,023
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah! Come on out!

178
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:07,297
(all applaud)

179
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:09,661
MATT: Come here. You've been amazing.

180
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,633
AMANDINE: Thank you.

181
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,202
SAM: If anyone would like to sponsor-slash-marry
her, she could stay--

182
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:14,899
(all laugh)

183
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:19,110
SAM: -- and she could stay on the crew. Just a
quick little marriage.

184
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,510
MATT: We all tried, everyone here did our best,
but we're going to

185
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,043
miss you terribly and you've been amazing.

186
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:25,536
AMANDINE: I will miss you too.

187
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,630
MARISHA: I know, you've been great, man.

188
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,954
LAURA: You're amazing.

189
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:30,209
MARISHA: She's been working on Talks Machina,
kicking ass.

190
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,058
MATT: Yeah, she's been kicking ass on set.

191
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:33,404
SAM: She's why it looks good now.

192
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:34,450
MARISHA: Really, yeah.

193
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,350
MATT: Seriously, so, everyone send your love,
give your hearts out, and yeah, we'll look

194
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,060
forward to seeing your adventures as you progress
and we'll bring you back as soon as we can.

195
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,257
We'll find a way.

196
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:43,516
AMANDINE: Okay.

197
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:44,548
LAURA: Yeah!

198
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:45,338
MARISHA: We love you!

199
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:46,526
MATT: Thank you.

200
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:47,436
AMANDINE: Thank you, guys.

201
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,560
TRAVIS: Woo-woo!

202
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,373
SAM: Let's bring the show to her!

203
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,596
MATT: Yeah, perfect! We're coming to Switzerland!

204
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,653
TALIESIN: I'm okay with that.

205
00:28:54,653 --> 00:29:02,480
MATT: Guys. Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's
episode... of Critical Role.

206
00:29:02,480 --> 00:30:32,442
[opening credits]

207
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:38,768
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. As we left off
on the adventures of Vox Machina, you had just

208
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:45,570
finished destroying the long-standing reign and
terrorizing assault of the Chroma Conclave across

209
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:53,073
the face of Tal'Dorei. As you finished that
chapter, defeating Raishan and collecting the

210
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:58,308
remnants of the necromancer's sanctum of where the
final battle took place, you returned with the

211
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:02,369
unfortunately fallen corpse of your friend,
Scanlan Shorthalt. You succeeded in the

212
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:07,945
resurrection, however upon returning from
Vasselheim, Scanlan coming to consciousness,

213
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:14,313
it was discovered that Scanlan was in a place in
his life where he needed to take some time with

214
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:22,190
his estranged and recently discovered daughter.
And arguments ensued, and agreement was had that

215
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,393
he would step away from Vox Machina to follow his
own path. The group took a period to mourn,

216
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:36,778
and then began to decide what their next layer of
plans were, what loose ends still were held out

217
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:43,642
there, and you made your way to the city of
Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet to return

218
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:51,173
the right hand of Ripley, the person responsible
for assassinating a member of the Scarbearers

219
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:57,988
within the Debt's Respite tavern in the city.
As you made your way past the bazaar towards the

220
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:04,141
inn, on the outside you saw what appeared to be a
large humanoid structure built of iron and metal

221
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:13,720
walking on its own behind a very flashily dressed
blond gentleman with goatee and a, for lack of a

222
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,999
better term, braggartly demeanor who managed to
weasel his way into the company of Vox Machina and

223
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:29,008
to continue his adventures alongside theirs as his
robot friend Doty continued to archive it in his

224
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:36,779
book of his adventures. And that is where we left
off. As you guys step into the relatively empty

225
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:45,993
interior of the Debt's Respite at this hour,
with this individual Taryon Darrington in tow.

226
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,950
TRAVIS: Is that really his name?

227
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,782
LAURA: That's his name.

228
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:49,843
SAM: Still his name.

229
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:50,777
LAURA: Taryon Darrington.

230
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:55,374
SAM: Still his name.

231
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,533
LAURA: We agreed to bring him along because he's
paying us.

232
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,090
MATT: Correct.

233
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,092
LAURA: That is an important fact.

234
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,059
MATT: That is a very important fact.

235
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,704
TRAVIS: Oi, T-- Tar--

236
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:07,256
SAM: Friends call me Tary, Jumbo.

237
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:08,569
TRAVIS: Tary Jumbo.

238
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,751
SAM: No, you're Jumbo, I'm Tary.

239
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:18,069
TRAVIS: Jumbo-- Tar-- I'm Tary. Can you spell out
your name for me on a piece of parchment?

240
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:22,469
SAM: Sure. Do you write?

241
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:24,853
TRAVIS: Frequently.

242
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:28,159
SAM: T-A-R-Y-O-N-D-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N

243
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,880
TRAVIS: No, no. I asked you to spell it out on a
piece of parchment.

244
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,233
SAM: Oh, you want me to write it down.

245
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:36,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm, uh, I study handwriting.

246
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:45,013
SAM: I understand. A scholarly mind is not a thing
to shirk. Doty, write out my name in the finest

247
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,935
calligraphy and give him a page.

248
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:51,376
MATT: (writing noises) And the hand seems to pick
up speed

249
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:53,789
and start rapidly whipping across the page--

250
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:54,794
TRAVIS: Whoa.

251
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:58,432
MATT: (tearing paper noise) Tears it out and
presents it to you rather forcefully just over

252
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:05,441
Taryon's head. And it is pretty fine calligraphy,
actually. Not that you can appreciate it.

253
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:06,255
TRAVIS: I know.

254
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,560
MATT: It just looks like a god damn scribble.

255
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,887
(all laugh)

256
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:09,546
LAURA: Scribbles!

257
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:15,626
TRAVIS: Mm! Yes. Uh-huh. Thank you.

258
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:19,014
SAM: You're quite welcome, Jumbo.

259
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,093
TRAVIS: Oh my god, behind you!

260
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,891
SAM: What, what is it?

261
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:27,686
TRAVIS: It was nothing. I'm always looking out for
this group, though. Thank you.

262
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:33,846
SAM: Are you the leader of this collection of
individuals? You are the biggest.

263
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:34,532
TRAVIS: No, I'm--

264
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,182
LAURA: Our leader isn't with us right now.

265
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:37,629
TRAVIS: Yeah, just the biggest.

266
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:44,585
SAM: Hm. All right. Have we already begun our
mission that we're on right now?

267
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:45,466
TRAVIS: Nope.

268
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:46,091
SAM: Oh.

269
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,849
TRAVIS: We just got here and then you started
talking.

270
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:49,006
SAM: You're right.

271
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:52,088
TALIESIN: I'm getting drinks for everybody.
I assume we've got the table at this point.

272
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:56,098
MATT: The entire establishment pretty much is full
except for a couple of individuals that you

273
00:34:56,098 --> 00:35:01,583
remember from before who are kind of masquerading
as patrons, but each, while they have their drink

274
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,043
in front of them, they haven't touched it,
and they have their hand on the side of their

275
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:12,326
sword belts. At the bar, there is nobody currently
manning it. And as this conversation's occurring

276
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:18,202
you do see the familiar face of Treev Bonebreaker,
the bronze Dragonborn who is the Scarbearer Head

277
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:23,408
here within the facility, turn the corner into the
room. It looks like he's wiping out what looks to

278
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:28,734
be a large tankard, as he kind of like gives it a
shine and looks over.

279
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:34,680
"Well, look at that. It looks like they all
returned. It's not often you see folks who are at

280
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,926
"least trying to stick to their word."

281
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:39,291
LAURA:  Well, that's us--

282
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,412
TRAVIS: We've been here before?

283
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:44,461
LAURA: -- promise keepers. Yes, dear.

284
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,116
TRAVIS: Oh.

285
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:47,560
TALIESIN: We're trying to stick to our word at the
very least.

286
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,487
MARISHA: Key word is 'try'. Mainly by avoiding
death at this point.

287
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,799
MATT: One would recommend that.

288
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:55,424
MARISHA: Yeah.

289
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,188
MATT: Yeah.

290
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,683
TALIESIN: Vax? Who has--

291
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:00,398
LAURA:  Grog.

292
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:01,310
TALIESIN: Grog!

293
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,209
LAURA: I believe.

294
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,028
MARISHA: The bag of holding.

295
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,118
TRAVIS: Oh god, don't point to me, I forgot we
were even here.

296
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,100
LAURA: Or maybe, unless you meant to say me and
you said Vax.

297
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,752
TALIESIN: No!

298
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:09,198
LAURA: Because why would Vax have anything,
I'm the one with the bag of colding.

299
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:11,188
LIAM: See, actually, this is one of those
instances where it

300
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,873
sounded halfway between Vax and Vex--

301
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:15,100
TALIESIN: It was not, it was a "Vax."

302
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,291
LIAM: It could work for either of us.

303
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,369
TALIESIN: I will definitely, I will stand behind
that.

304
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:19,466
MARISHA: Sure, it was like a long 'a' like a
Vaaax.

305
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:20,404
LAURA: Vaaax.

306
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,472
LIAM: It's the "ae" thing.

307
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,539
TALIESIN:  It was Vax, it was not a Vex.

308
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:25,008
SAM: What's your name? I am a bit confused at
what's going on here so--

309
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:25,998
(all laugh)

310
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:27,286
SAM:  What's your name?

311
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,618
MATT: Treev. What's your name?

312
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:32,021
SAM: Taryon Darrington. You may have heard of me.
Friends call me Tary.

313
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:32,975
MATT: No.

314
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:35,574
SAM:  Well, you will once my book comes out.

315
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:38,027
TALIESIN: I don't think that-- no.

316
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:39,352
MATT: Who's this fucker?

317
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:41,186
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA:  We don't know.

318
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:42,627
TRAVIS: Tary Jumbo.

319
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:48,469
TALIESIN: He just sort of found us outside.
And he had, honestly--

320
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:51,173
LAURA: Just ignore him, really. How about that?

321
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:52,897
TALIESIN: We're not entirely sure what happened
here.

322
00:36:52,897 --> 00:36:54,766
MATT: Ah, there's some fancy garb you're wearing.

323
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,918
SAM: Oh, yes. Quite fancy.

324
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:57,955
MATT:  Good to know.

325
00:36:57,955 --> 00:37:00,681
SAM: Deadly as well.

326
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:01,885
MATT: Anyway.

327
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:02,771
LAURA:  Grog--

328
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:05,752
MATT:  He leans forward. "So what? Are you here to
talk--"

329
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:06,604
TALIESIN: Grog?

330
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,472
MATT: "-- or drink?  You here to talk?"

331
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:11,680
LAURA:  Shall we bust it out here or do you want
to talk in private?

332
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,979
MATT: He does a quick scan of the room. "It's my
people and you. Might as well."

333
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,048
LAURA: Should I dig into the bag of holding?

334
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,613
TRAVIS: What? I don't even remember being here!

335
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,986
LAURA:  Okay, I'm just gonna reach in the bag of
holding and pull out the hand.

336
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:27,628
MATT:  Okay, and you do. You find the mechanical
digits of Ripley,

337
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:30,158
plus some of them partially bent
from the combat--

338
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:31,181
TRAVIS: Oh!

339
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,095
LAURA: Oh yeah!

340
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:33,728
TRAVIS: I still don't have it, I'm trying to--

341
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:34,982
LAURA: It's good.

342
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:38,402
TALIESIN: We have the human hand as well.
We have the mechanical hand and the human hand.

343
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,394
MARISHA: Yeah, we took both.

344
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:42,169
TALIESIN:  We took both. We figured we'd have
options, if I recall.

345
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:45,030
LAURA: Oh, that's right, I put the regular hand--
did we?

346
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,811
TALIESIN: We took both! We took the robot hand and
the--

347
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,897
To be fair, I was dead at the time so I don't--

348
00:37:49,897 --> 00:37:55,313
TRAVIS: Tary, we work on very strict rules.
If you fuck us, we take your hands.

349
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:58,200
SAM: You have more than one hand with you right
now?

350
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,432
LIAM:  We have a lot of stuff in that bag.

351
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,323
LAURA: You wouldn't even.

352
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:01,126
TALIESIN: Huge collection.

353
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:02,116
TRAVIS: We really don't know what's in there.

354
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,117
LAURA: You don't want to see in there.

355
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,191
MARISHA: Lots of body parts.

356
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:05,215
TALIESIN: It's pretty gruesome.

357
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:06,380
SAM: Okay...

358
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,174
TRAVIS: Yeah.

359
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,209
TALIESIN: You have to ask, then--

360
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:11,387
SAM: Just tell me when to start swinging the
sword.

361
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:13,773
TRAVIS: Thought you had to-- oh, yeah! And it
extends, but--

362
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:14,840
SAM: Sure.

363
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,772
MATT: Do you pass over the hand?

364
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:17,760
LAURA: Sure!

365
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,662
MATT: While this is happening you kind of slam it
down on the table. The giant, bronze dragonborn

366
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:27,329
claw reaches out and grabs it, and rakes it
forward, picks it up, and the fingers fall limp in

367
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,555
the grasp. And he turns it around in his vision.

368
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:37,765
(sniffs) "It's a strange contraption. Certainly
looks like a hand."

369
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:40,591
LAURA: She was a strange woman.

370
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:43,950
MATT: So you're telling me, this is the one that
took out the Mistress Asharru?

371
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,814
TALIESIN: I put the Retort Pistol on the table.
She used one of these devices.

372
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:56,903
MATT: "Right, right. Very well."

373
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,379
He takes the hand and begins scraping the pistol 
back with him as well.

374
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:05,039
TALIESIN: The pistol was just for show. It wasn't
a gift.

375
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:15,172
MATT: "All right. Well, at least the Mistress can
lay at rest. I thank you for your deed."

376
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:18,717
And he spins his finger in the air and one of the 
men at the table gets up and walks

377
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:22,710
out of the room and exits through the 
front door behind you.

378
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:28,774
TALIESIN: I won't pretend that we didn't have our
own reasons for it. But we are grateful that you

379
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:32,598
recognize that we respect your authority.

380
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:36,925
MATT: Takes some balls to come back here and not
have anything to show for it. So, glad you got

381
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:40,127
balls, all of you. Except for that one.

382
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,326
LAURA: Giant balls. Yeah, his I'm not sure of--

383
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,157
TALIESIN: We haven't checked his, to be fair.

384
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:45,648
SAM: They're quite-- quite lovely.

385
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:46,764
(all laugh)

386
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:50,803
MATT: Well, I have called off my associates.
The hunt is null and void.

387
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:53,140
You're free to wander without worry.

388
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,832
LAURA: Thank you, Treev.

389
00:39:54,832 --> 00:40:01,494
TALIESIN: We'll probably only be another day or
two in town before we head home. Thank you.

390
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:03,313
Thank you for your time.

391
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,386
LAURA: We're out.

392
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:06,589
TRAVIS:  Did we not get anything for that?

393
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,308
LAURA:  We got our lives.

394
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,789
TALIESIN: We got someone to remove a debt upon our
heads.

395
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:12,525
MARISHA: Yes.

396
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:13,332
TRAVIS: Oh.

397
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:14,648
MARISHA: Yes.

398
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:16,208
TRAVIS: Could we see the debt or was it magic?

399
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,750
TALIESIN: It was metaphorical.

400
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,531
LAURA: Magic. Pure magic.

401
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:22,000
TALIESIN: Magic. Sure.

402
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,650
TRAVIS: Whoa. Glad we did that.

403
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:29,558
(all laugh)

404
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,582
MATT: Stay for a drink?

405
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,948
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes! Yes!

406
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,040
TALIESIN: Yes.

407
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,521
LIAM: Yeah. Let the big guy play.

408
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,556
MARISHA and LAURA: Sure.

409
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:41,125
LAURA: But I wanna keep an eye out on the bar
because I still don't trust our environment.

410
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,644
MATT: Certainly. It's been kinda low-key here for
the day.

411
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,282
TRAVIS: Tary, do you drink anything?

412
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:47,071
SAM: Wine, mostly, yes.

413
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,461
TRAVIS: Does Dottie drink anything?

414
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:49,326
SAM: Doty.

415
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:49,956
TRAVIS: Right.

416
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:51,175
SAM: He does not drink.

417
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:52,494
TRAVIS: Then that's two for you. I'll have two of
your

418
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:56,273
strongest whatevers for blond-chin over there.

419
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:58,455
MATT: All right. Anyone else?

420
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,562
TALIESIN: Yes, please.

421
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:04,764
MATT:  "Round it is." And he goes and he gathers
up a number of small mugs, tankards, it's

422
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:10,446
ramshackle in here. This essentially acts as a
base of operations first and a tavern a distant

423
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:15,840
second, so it's barely functional really as a
comparable establishment for fine drinks and

424
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,246
atmosphere, but it works.

425
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:18,715
TALIESIN: Heineken's coming, basically.

426
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:26,258
MATT: Yeah, yeah. The drinks are passed around,
some small talk's made with Treev, discussing

427
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:32,728
just how things have been pretty low-key since
Asharru was killed and you guys last left,

428
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:37,652
there hasn't been an upset. There was apparently
a vision of some sort of a creature at the top of

429
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:40,232
the Cerulean Palace a few days ago.

430
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,251
LAURA: Really?

431
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:47,358
MATT: But people were wondering if that was a
sighting of Devo'ssa, and some of the rather

432
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:54,065
intense historians and younger believers in the
myth of Devo'ssa have been up in a tizzy,

433
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,565
and Treev just kinda shrugs it off and takes a
drink and goes,

434
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:59,629
"Just what we need is another 
bigger fucking dragon."

435
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:02,831
TALIESIN: Not for a long time, one would hope.

436
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,776
MATT: Aye.

437
00:42:04,776 --> 00:42:06,510
TALIESIN: So. Tary?

438
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,370
SAM: Yes?

439
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,541
TALIESIN: I have to admit, I'm curious, where did
you get your friend there?

440
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,963
SAM: Why, I made him!

441
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:16,148
TALIESIN: Did you?

442
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:17,097
SAM: Yes, I did?

443
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:22,553
TALIESIN: Really? What's his power? How's he
powered? What runs him? I'm just sort of curious.

444
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:26,650
SAM: I-- no offense, but I doubt you would
understand the

445
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,788
inner workings of something as
complicated as this.

446
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:41,225
TALIESIN: That's a very interesting thought you
have there. But, still, I would be just delighted

447
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:46,381
to hear your attempt to simplify it for me.

448
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:52,144
SAM: All right, I will. Are you familiar with
levers? Things that move up and down?

449
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:55,183
TALIESIN: Yes.

450
00:42:55,183 --> 00:43:03,434
SAM: Yes? Some of those. There's also a machine
called a pulley where you can apply force and it

451
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:06,121
will amplify it with a wheel and a string.

452
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:09,198
TALIESIN:  I think I've read about such things
before, yes.

453
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:13,013
SAM:  Some of those are in there. Also, an
incline. It's another simple machine.

454
00:43:13,013 --> 00:43:14,532
TALIESIN: You didn't build it, did you?

455
00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:15,550
SAM: I did build it.

456
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,418
TALIESIN: Did you? Did you build it?

457
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:19,057
SAM: I did build it.

458
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:24,793
TALIESIN: So, one would assume there's an access
panel somewhere on him where one can make

459
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:27,401
adjustments, or otherwise fix him if he breaks
down?

460
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,390
SAM: Pretty fancy technological speak.

461
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,773
TALIESIN: Thank you. Where would the access panel
be?

462
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:37,318
SAM: Why do you care to know?

463
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,787
TALIESIN: Well, just in case you're knocked
unconscious by, let's say, someone sneaking up

464
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,506
behind you and hitting you with a weapon?

465
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:45,413
SAM: Won't happen. Doty has my back. Right, Doty?

466
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:52,655
MATT: At which point Doty crams in right behind
and is dwarfing Tary in size with the broad

467
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:55,798
metallic shoulders and is (heavy footfalls)

468
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:58,884
TALIESIN: Doty? Did he build you?

469
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:03,064
MATT: No response.

470
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:08,586
SAM: I'm a bit of a tinkerer. I can show you a few
things if we have a quiet moment, not in public.

471
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:09,437
TALIESIN: Can you?

472
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:11,524
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

473
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,571
TALIESIN: That would be... excellent.

474
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,780
SAM: I look forward to the lesson.

475
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,211
TALIESIN: I look forward to giving the lesson,
yes.

476
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:24,839
LIAM: I'm curious if we could uh, it was
Ermergerd, right?

477
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,777
SAM: My name?

478
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:30,381
LIAM: Ermergerd Swearengen, yeah.

479
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:33,376
(all laugh)

480
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:39,635
SAM: Nope. You misheard me, Little Elf Boy,
it's Taryon Darrington.

481
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:52,536
LIAM: Fucking don't like this guy. I'm curious,
where do you hail from? Are you from here?

482
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:55,760
SAM: Nope, not from here. Matt, we discussed this,
where am I from?

483
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,078
(all laugh)

484
00:44:59,078 --> 00:45:04,836
SAM: You gave me three options.

485
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:05,538
MATT: I did.

486
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:07,852
SAM: And I was like, "hmm, I don't know what any
of those--"

487
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:08,991
TRAVIS: Hey Tary! Open up!

488
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,499
LIAM: Ooh.

489
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,544
TRAVIS: Missile snaring!

490
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:12,603
LAURA: Missile snaring!

491
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:14,597
TALIESIN: Gloves of Missile Snaring are currently
equipped, motherfucker!

492
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:15,645
MATT: Oh, shit!

493
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:18,811
(all laugh)

494
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:19,916
MARISHA: That's great.

495
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:24,571
MATT: That's beautiful. Okay. Let me go look up
the information that I emailed you.

496
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,692
SAM: I can also look it up.

497
00:45:25,692 --> 00:45:27,543
LIAM: Who is that guy and what is email?

498
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:29,500
LAURA: Yeah?

499
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,628
TALIESIN: Doty's got email.

500
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:35,627
MATT: You are from the city of Diastock,
in the Truscan Empire of Wildmount.

501
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:36,385
SAM: What he just said.

502
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,492
LAURA: Wildmount! You're from Wildmount.

503
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:38,622
TALIESIN: Wildmount, fine.

504
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:40,362
MARISHA: He's from Dias-where?

505
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,471
MATT: Diastock.

506
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,927
MARISHA: Diastock.

507
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:43,998
MATT: In the Truscan Empire

508
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:44,911
MARISHA: Dia--

509
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:45,713
LIAM: Stark.

510
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:47,834
MARISHA: --stock.

511
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:49,412
LAURA: Wildmount, hm?

512
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:50,802
MARISHA: Truscan?

513
00:45:50,802 --> 00:45:51,676
LAURA: Yeah.

514
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:53,722
SAM: Have you been?

515
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,157
LAURA: I haven't been no.

516
00:45:55,157 --> 00:45:56,688
LIAM: No we've not been.

517
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:57,593
SAM: It's quite lovely.

518
00:45:57,593 --> 00:45:58,783
LIAM: Yeah?

519
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:02,050
SAM: My family has quite a reputation there and I
live on

520
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,721
a vast compound with beautiful orchards and--

521
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:10,663
MARISHA: Wait! You're not related to the
Briarwoods, are you?

522
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:13,338
SAM: I'm sorry, no, I don't know them.

523
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:14,721
TALIESIN: He doesn't look like a Briarwood.

524
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,598
LAURA: No.

525
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:18,087
MARISHA: Have you ever heard the name Briarwood
before?

526
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:22,159
SAM: I have not, I'm sorry. Is Antlers okay over
here?

527
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,792
LAURA: She's quite all right.

528
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:27,688
SAM: All right. She seems a bit drunk already or
something.

529
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:28,728
LAURA: She always does.

530
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:29,475
SAM: All right.

531
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:31,885
MARISHA: That's true. Especially these days.

532
00:46:31,885 --> 00:46:34,453
LIAM: Bring back the history lesson, though.
So pampered,

533
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:36,339
young, everything you could ever want--

534
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:38,457
SAM: I wouldn't say pampered. All right?

535
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:40,033
LIAM: Those were my words. Go on.

536
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,071
TRAVIS: Huggies.

537
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:45,668
SAM: I had a normal upbringing. Private tutors,
classes--

538
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:46,911
LAURA: Right, as you do.

539
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:47,728
LIAM: Same. Same.

540
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:49,466
LAURA: Right.

541
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:55,608
SAM: I wandered through the halls of our extensive
library many nights.

542
00:46:55,608 --> 00:46:57,511
Read many books about adventure--

543
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,087
TRAVIS: Yes, keep going.

544
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:01,857
SAM: -- exploration, magic, alchemy--

545
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:04,579
LIAM: Is that code for masturbating?

546
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:06,611
SAM: I mean... you know.

547
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:08,464
TALIESIN: Yes, yes it is.

548
00:47:08,464 --> 00:47:10,827
MARISHA: Kind of sounds like your upbringing,
Percy.

549
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,333
TALIESIN: Yes, it was code for masturbating.

550
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:16,513
(all laugh)

551
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:19,138
SAM: My family runs a very prosperous business,
and yes,

552
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:23,065
I have received some benefits from that.

553
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:24,337
LAURA: Mm-hm.

554
00:47:24,337 --> 00:47:26,148
SAM: But I am a self-starter in my own mind and--

555
00:47:26,148 --> 00:47:27,130
LAURA: Oh God!

556
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,263
TALIESIN: (yells)

557
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:29,961
MARISHA: God!

558
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:33,868
SAM: I've gone out on my own to seek my fortune--

559
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:36,838
TRAVIS: Oh God. The universe is collapsing.

560
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:39,590
TALIESIN: We've lost Liam.

561
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,902
SAM: -- and record my exploits.

562
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:45,176
LAURA: Did you purchase that armor all on your own
as well, or did Mommy and Daddy buy it for you?

563
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:49,010
SAM: I purchased it myself. With my money, that--

564
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,331
LIAM: Bequeathed to you.

565
00:47:50,331 --> 00:47:51,862
SAM: -- that I can withdraw once a month.

566
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:53,341
(all laugh)

567
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:56,665
TALIESIN: It is quite lovely.

568
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,188
SAM: But it is mine.

569
00:47:58,188 --> 00:48:01,059
LAURA: That's good.

570
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:04,265
SAM: It belongs to me. It's my birthright.

571
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:10,780
TRAVIS: Tary Jumbo, do you have a most dangerous
conquest in that book? That Dotty has.

572
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:16,023
SAM: Doty. I have a list of adventures that I am
currently going through.

573
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,117
LAURA: (quietly) He's such an ass.

574
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:20,471
SAM: Some of the adventures include: Rescue a
maiden--

575
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:21,724
TRAVIS: Just any maiden?

576
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,151
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

577
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:31,930
SAM: Transport a treasure. Escort a muckety-muck.
A revenge plot. A classic dungeon crawl.

578
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,787
Oh, this one I'm looking forward to! Solving a
mysterious riddle.

579
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,272
LAURA: Ooh!

580
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:41,596
SAM: The old fashioned double-cross. Teleport,
haven't done that yet.

581
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:42,723
LAURA: Really?

582
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:45,430
SAM: Shopping mission, but really I can wait on
that one.

583
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,850
(all laugh)

584
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:57,080
SAM: Slay a dragon. And there's more, but the list
is extensive and I'd like to conquer various

585
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:04,085
beasts, rescue different people, find different
treasures. It's going to be quite an adventure.

586
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:06,737
TRAVIS: Shopping is not what it's cracked up to
be.

587
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:09,050
You should just wipe it off the list right now.

588
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,671
SAM: Shopping?

589
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:10,525
TRAVIS: While we're watching.

590
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:12,668
SAM: It's low on the list. It's a low one.

591
00:49:12,668 --> 00:49:14,099
TRAVIS: You can just erase it. You'll be fine.

592
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,620
SAM: All right, I will.

593
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,670
LAURA: It's funny, that whole list... it seems
like we've done all of it.

594
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,459
MARISHA: I know.

595
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:19,208
TALIESIN: Yeah.

596
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:19,858
LAURA: Yeah.

597
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:20,605
SAM: Have you?

598
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:21,518
TRAVIS: Several times.

599
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:24,607
TALIESIN: Oh yes. How many dragons now?

600
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:25,343
LIAM: Lost count.

601
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:26,107
TRAVIS: Hard to count.

602
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:27,858
LAURA: Five? Six? Something like that.

603
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:30,390
SAM: You haven't really, have you?

604
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,391
LIAM: Yeah, we have.

605
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,287
SAM: An actual dragon?

606
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:33,067
TALIESIN: Several of them.

607
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:34,039
LIAM: Multiple dragons.

608
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:34,810
LAURA: Ancient dragons

609
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,670
TRAVIS: Dragons.

610
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,296
SAM: What was it like?

611
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:38,436
LAURA: Deadly.

612
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:41,470
MARISHA: Tary, do you feel like we look healthy
and sane to you?

613
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,780
SAM: I mean--

614
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,672
TALIESIN: Don't hold back.

615
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:46,412
MARISHA: It's fine, you can be honest.

616
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:47,943
SAM: Healthy AND sane?

617
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,582
MARISHA: Yes.

618
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:55,765
SAM: You seem healthy. You certainly are decked
out in adventuring gear, which is quite

619
00:49:55,765 --> 00:50:04,218
attractive. Sanity I can't be a good judge of yet,
I just met you. You seem like lovely creatures.

620
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:07,015
LIAM: How old are you, exactly?

621
00:50:07,015 --> 00:50:08,428
SAM: I'm a young 28.

622
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:15,188
LIAM: You and I are the same age.

623
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,530
SAM: Is that true?

624
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,778
LAURA: It's weird, you look older, but you act
younger.

625
00:50:18,778 --> 00:50:22,150
SAM: Oh, that is strange. Youthful exuberance,
I suppose.

626
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,856
LAURA: I suppose.

627
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,732
SAM: (hearty laugh)

628
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:29,522
MARISHA: So, what do you hope to accomplish at the
end of completing all these tasks, you know,

629
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:32,451
slaying a dragon? What do you want in the other
end?

630
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:39,850
SAM: The other end will be my masterpiece,
my book. Doty has been very, very good about

631
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:47,080
taking down all of my adventures and exploits,
and at the end of it all... I know we just met,

632
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,480
but may I share with you some of my working
titles?

633
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,382
TRAVIS: Please.

634
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,068
SAM: All right.

635
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:52,976
TALIESIN: Oh, please.

636
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:54,397
LAURA: I would love to hear.

637
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:55,347
TRAVIS: Hold on. Wait, one more!

638
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:56,920
TALIESIN: Another round, I've got it, I've got
it.

639
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,787
MATT: Treev's already on it. Treev is like, "Oh,
don't worry. I'm loving this." Then he's just

640
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:06,616
pouring all of you glasses and shoving them
forward to you guys and crossing his arms.

641
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:09,291
TRAVIS: Maybe some meats too, if you have any.
Or cheeses.

642
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,265
MATT: We ain't got meat.

643
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:11,672
TRAVIS: Oh.

644
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:17,463
LAURA: I want to keep an eye-- I'm keeping an eye
out for any kind of questionable behavior.

645
00:51:17,463 --> 00:51:22,399
MATT: All right, perception check. Go ahead.

646
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:23,424
LAURA: (quietly) God damn it.

647
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,716
TALIESIN: That's a huge die you just rolled.

648
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:25,461
LAURA: I know, right?

649
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:26,524
TRAVIS: It's a newbie, it's a newbie.

650
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:27,403
LAURA: 17.

651
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:28,675
MATT: Okay, good to know. Continue.

652
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:30,016
TRAVIS: Which is why it screwed you.

653
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:34,483
SAM: Maybe you fellows could help me pick a title.
Here's what I have so far.

654
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:35,999
LAURA: I thought we already did, the Daring
Adventures of--

655
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:37,610
TALIESIN: We talked about it briefly.

656
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,416
SAM: That was a good one, but I have some other
ones.

657
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:40,523
LAURA: All right.

658
00:51:40,523 --> 00:51:43,291
SAM: Tarry On with Taryon Darrington.

659
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:47,332
The Terrific and Terrifying Tales of Daring 
Taryon Darrington--

660
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,281
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

661
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:49,242
LIAM: That is all right.

662
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,237
SAM: Fifty Shades of Tary.

663
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:52,000
(all laugh)

664
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,608
SAM: Bravado! The T. Darrington Story.

665
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:56,911
LAURA: That one seems appropriate.

666
00:51:56,911 --> 00:51:59,517
SAM: Zen and the Art of Robot Manservant Repair.

667
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,393
LIAM: No. No. Thumbs down.

668
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,956
SAM: Adventuring for Dummies.

669
00:52:03,956 --> 00:52:05,025
TALIESIN: I feel like that's been done.

670
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:06,403
SAM: The Things They Tarried.

671
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:07,462
LAURA: Oh.

672
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:09,010
SAM: The Blond Hair of Courage.

673
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:12,411
(all laugh)

674
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:14,205
SAM: The Adventures of Huckle-Tary Finn.

675
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:24,465
(all laugh)

676
00:52:24,465 --> 00:52:25,399
SAM: The Odyssey.

677
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:26,051
MARISHA: Oh.

678
00:52:26,051 --> 00:52:27,482
LAURA: Classic.

679
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:29,787
TRAVIS: What? No!

680
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:30,839
TALIESIN: Seen it.

681
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,714
SAM: Tary's Daring Do's and Daring Do-Nots.
Dungeons and Darringtons.

682
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:35,939
LAURA: Oh, wow.

683
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:37,019
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

684
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:40,176
SAM: And this one just popped into my head:
Critical Patrol.

685
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:42,070
(all laugh)

686
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,143
LIAM: I grab my sister by the arm, and I drag her
off the the side. What-- Why are we doing this

687
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:47,767
exactly? Why are we bringing him with us,
exactly?

688
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,925
MARISHA: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed, and she's
not sure why.

689
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:51,115
LAURA: His money.

690
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:54,812
LIAM: You think he can pay 50k an hour for
realsies?

691
00:52:54,812 --> 00:52:56,432
LAURA: Hey, Tary.

692
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:57,570
SAM: Hm? Oi.

693
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,944
LAURA: How much money do you have in your account
right now?

694
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:00,949
SAM: In my account?

695
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:02,609
LAURA: In your account.

696
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:06,127
SAM: I would not care to say. We're in a public
place.

697
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:08,310
LAURA: You can whisper it in my ear.

698
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,021
SAM: (whispers) I would not care to say.

699
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:16,816
LAURA: Here's what I need to know. Are you full of
shit and you don't actually have any money,

700
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:20,448
or do you have enough to pay our fee?

701
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:25,876
SAM: Does this helmet look like it's something
that didn't cost a shit ton of money?

702
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:29,227
LAURA: It looks like it did, but for all I know
you spent all your money on it.

703
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:34,696
SAM: All right, well, if you don't want the money,
we can

704
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:37,304
break the contract right now, and I'll go
my way.

705
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:41,622
LAURA: How about you just show me some money,
and that way we can be sure.

706
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:45,628
SAM: All right, I will. Come with me over to the
corner.

707
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:47,045
LAURA: All right.

708
00:53:47,045 --> 00:53:48,371
TRAVIS: That's where the good stuff happens.

709
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:49,657
TALIESIN: That was a nice little Jerry Maguire
there,

710
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:51,368
especially considering the date. Very appropriate.

711
00:53:51,368 --> 00:53:53,360
TRAVIS: Tavern corner.

712
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,944
SAM: Are we away from--?

713
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,897
MATT: You guys have stepped away from the rest of
the crowd, as you guys watch--

714
00:53:56,897 --> 00:53:58,303
TALIESIN: I am watching this--

715
00:53:58,303 --> 00:53:59,346
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

716
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:01,265
MATT: Tary kind of puts his arm on her shoulder--

717
00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:02,036
LAURA: Don't touch me.

718
00:54:02,036 --> 00:54:03,087
MATT: Leads her over to the corner.

719
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:04,117
LAURA: Don't touch me.

720
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:05,544
SAM: I'll reach into my Bag of Holding

721
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:07,632
TRAVIS: (gasps)

722
00:54:07,632 --> 00:54:12,442
SAM: And pull up just a handful of coin.

723
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:19,396
MATT: A nice fistful of pristine platinum pieces
in his grip.

724
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:25,761
LAURA: Just a whole bag of that? I want to look at
one.

725
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:27,564
TRAVIS: Yeah, insight check that money.

726
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,280
SAM: Ding!

727
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,883
LAURA: Don't. Flick. Money at me. Dear. If you
want to keep your hands.

728
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:37,199
SAM: I'm sorry, Little--

729
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:38,102
LAURA: Is this--?

730
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:42,298
MATT: You hear the scratching sound of quill on
parchment as Doty has arrived behind you and is

731
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:44,925
now currently cataloguing the entire
conversation.

732
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,856
(all laugh)

733
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:49,833
LAURA: Does it look real?

734
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:54,551
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

735
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:55,556
TRAVIS: Fucking roll high.

736
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:58,826
LAURA: I'm gonna use my gold dice for this.
It makes sense.

737
00:54:58,826 --> 00:54:59,604
LIAM: Oh, that was not good.

738
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:00,560
LAURA: Ah, fuckin' A.

739
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,120
TALIESIN: Yellow and black!

740
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:05,227
TRAVIS: That's not the cup of a carpenter.

741
00:55:05,227 --> 00:55:06,871
LAURA: That's only 15.

742
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:10,743
MATT: Okay. You've seen quite a few gold,
platinum pieces in your time.

743
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:13,032
This seems fairly legit.

744
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:14,768
LAURA: All right.

745
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:21,689
MATT: It seems like it's been minted recently,
relative in the past maybe ten or so years.

746
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:30,790
It has not seen a lot of antiquing across its
surface, and most of the coin is branded in a way

747
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:35,993
that emanates from the Truscan Empire. It does
appear to have Wildmount origin.

748
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:43,181
LAURA: Lovely. I believe you. Congratulations on
being born into privilege.

749
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:53,057
SAM: Yes, well, I didn't choose to be, and I am
trying to lead my life honest and true, humble and

750
00:55:53,148 --> 00:56:02,814
brave, every day of my life. And I thank you for
allowing me to travel with you, and perhaps go on

751
00:56:02,814 --> 00:56:08,467
a mission? I mean, is this mission going to start
at some point?

752
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:11,113
LAURA: It was just completed, didn't you notice?

753
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,038
SAM: I'm sorry?

754
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:17,474
LAURA: It happened right under your eyes.
Mysterious, isn't it?  And I walk away.

755
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,401
MARISHA: It's true, she's actually very correct.

756
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,848
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy.

757
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:22,534
TALIESIN: Yes.

758
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:23,604
TRAVIS: We're not near them, right?

759
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:24,400
TALIESIN: No.

760
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,637
TRAVIS: Hey, hey. Remember when we were at
Greyskull Keep,

761
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:33,101
and we made all the guards, like,
audition to be guards?

762
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,840
TALIESIN: Yes, that was quite a while ago.

763
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:41,052
TRAVIS: What if we have an audition for Tary
Jumbo?

764
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,910
TALIESIN: It's not the most ridiculous thing I've
ever heard.

765
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:45,305
TRAVIS: I love it when I do that, right?

766
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:50,347
TALIESIN: I know, it's quite good. Let's finish up
our business here.

767
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:51,526
TRAVIS: We have business here?

768
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:54,849
TALIESIN: Well, I think we should--

769
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:58,086
MARISHA: Does anyone not understand, we had a
mission here that we just completed?

770
00:56:58,086 --> 00:56:59,218
LAURA: We just did it! We completed it!

771
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:00,133
MARISHA: We just did it!

772
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,932
TALIESIN: We were also going to go to the Cerulean
Tower and have a quick conversation.

773
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:03,125
LAURA: Yeah, no. We need to do that.

774
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,854
TALIESIN: We need to do that. But we did just
finish a mission.

775
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,970
MARISHA: Wait, J'mon?

776
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,914
TALIESIN: Yes, we have to talk to--

777
00:57:06,914 --> 00:57:09,410
MARISHA: I am not taking him to J'mon.

778
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,342
LIAM: That's probably wise.

779
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,938
TRAVIS: You know, I can stand outside with him.

780
00:57:13,938 --> 00:57:19,548
MARISHA: We're like specially, you know, trained.
And proven ourselves warriors.

781
00:57:19,548 --> 00:57:21,101
We got permission to see--

782
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:24,214
TRAVIS: How about I audition him outside,
while you go have your convo? Like, we make him

783
00:57:24,214 --> 00:57:25,758
beat somebody up or something.

784
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:26,350
LIAM: Yeah.

785
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,944
LAURA: Audition who? What are you talking about?

786
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,298
TRAVIS: I'm saying we should, like,
initiate Ole Tary J.

787
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:32,207
TALIESIN: Like we did back at Greyskull.

788
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,036
LAURA: Oh!

789
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:34,736
TRAVIS: If that's what the letter that second word
starts with.

790
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:35,963
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah, right.

791
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:36,831
MARISHA: You did good, Grog.

792
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:37,410
LAURA: Impressive.

793
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,135
TRAVIS: Yup.

794
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:39,071
MARISHA: Good job.

795
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,524
LAURA: I thought you only learned Gs.

796
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,116
TRAVIS: What?

797
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,228
MARISHA: Tary G.

798
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:48,023
TALIESIN: Our business concluded, we actually have
some business at the Cerulean Tower, so we should

799
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:50,910
all, perhaps, head there at this point.

800
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,846
SAM: I... not to be a pest, but--

801
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,920
TALIESIN: Too late, but yes?

802
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,958
SAM: I paid for adventure.

803
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,613
TALIESIN: Oh, we're heading-- there will be
adventure.

804
00:57:58,613 --> 00:57:59,139
SAM: Okay.

805
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,992
LAURA: You didn't actually pay for anything.
You haven't paid.

806
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:02,479
SAM: I understand.

807
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,718
LIAM: And we also didn't offer access to every
contact and

808
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:10,029
person that we know on this globe, all right?

809
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:11,017
SAM: Understood.

810
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:13,192
LIAM: You're a tag-along.

811
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:14,673
SAM: And happy to be one.

812
00:58:14,673 --> 00:58:19,517
TRAVIS: Plus, these are several, subtle steps.
We don't just chuck you in the furnace right

813
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:23,261
away. We've got to temper you a bit.

814
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:25,114
SAM: Yeah. That makes total sense.

815
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:25,908
TRAVIS: Cool.

816
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:27,939
MARISHA: Besides, things just seem to happen
around us.

817
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:28,907
TALIESIN: Inevitably.

818
00:58:28,907 --> 00:58:30,342
MARISHA: So if you just hang out long enough,

819
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:34,291
I'm sure someone's gonna want to beat our ass
over something.

820
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:37,281
LAURA: Like, most boring day ever now that Tary's
here, we don't do anything fun at all.

821
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:39,348
TRAVIS: Set up a craft fair.

822
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:41,206
TALIESIN: Critical Craft Fair.

823
00:58:41,206 --> 00:58:42,526
LAURA: We all sit down and start knitting.

824
00:58:42,526 --> 00:58:44,397
TRAVIS: I will kill myself.

825
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:46,292
MARISHA: Go to the post office. Check our P.O.
box.

826
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,683
LAURA: (laughs) Do some grocery shopping.

827
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:48,451
TALIESIN: Laundry.

828
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:50,012
LIAM: VM Accounting.

829
00:58:50,012 --> 00:58:51,336
TALIESIN: Magazines.

830
00:58:51,336 --> 00:58:54,333
MATT: If only.

831
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,953
TALIESIN: So, yes. We would love to head in that
direction.

832
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:57,743
TRAVIS: Yeah! Cinnamon Tower!

833
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,680
(all laugh)

834
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,890
TALIESIN: That sounds weird.

835
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,212
MARISHA: I want to live in that world!

836
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:06,939
TALIESIN: I would also like to, quietly on the
headphone, I would really like to know where this

837
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:12,672
machine comes from, because I'm finding it just a
bit creepy, and I would love to get that

838
00:59:12,672 --> 00:59:14,444
information out of him before he disappears.

839
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:15,798
TRAVIS: How tall is it again?

840
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:18,161
MATT: It's roughly eight and a half feet tall.

841
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:19,923
TRAVIS: So just a bit taller than me?

842
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,156
MATT: A bit taller, yeah, I'd say a little larger
than that.

843
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:23,399
TRAVIS: A head and a half?

844
00:59:23,399 --> 00:59:25,837
MATT: It's kind of hunched forward as it walks,
it probably could stand taller if it wanted to.

845
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:28,282
TRAVIS: Was he kind of like, Fassbender size-ish,
or?

846
00:59:28,282 --> 00:59:29,314
MATT: Not as broad.

847
00:59:29,314 --> 00:59:30,617
LAURA: Fassbender was bigger, right?

848
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:31,185
TRAVIS: Okay.

849
00:59:31,185 --> 00:59:34,370
MATT: It's tall, but it's kind of lanky in its
construction, and it seems to be thicker at the

850
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:40,439
feet and the arms and fists, but the actual
structure itself is proportionally pretty thin.

851
00:59:40,439 --> 00:59:41,658
TRAVIS: Got it. It's Groot.

852
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:42,878
LIAM: Hey, Percy...

853
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:43,582
TALIESIN: Yes?

854
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:47,364
LIAM: I faintly remember you talking about,
you were talking to someone, I don't know who it

855
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:51,605
was, but you were talking about plans you had for
sort of a walking,

856
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:55,629
automated something. Am I
imagining that?

857
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:59,983
TALIESIN: I dabbled... No, I talked about it.
It always just seemed so impractical. And now I'm

858
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:03,031
looking at one, and I'm irritated.

859
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:05,103
LIAM: Yeah, I can see that.

860
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:11,622
MARISHA: Irritated? Or was inferior the word you
were looking for?

861
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:13,282
TALIESIN: Vexed.

862
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:15,696
MARISHA: Vexed, that's a good word.

863
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:16,765
LAURA: It is a good word.

864
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:17,994
TRAVIS: That's her name.

865
01:00:17,994 --> 01:00:20,820
LIAM: To be honest, you seem like you got your
goolies burned there

866
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,008
just from a conversation, a little bit.

867
01:00:22,008 --> 01:00:23,241
MARISHA: I know.

868
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:27,684
TALIESIN: He didn't build this thing, and I'm
worried about who did.

869
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:31,238
He didn't build this thing.

870
01:00:31,238 --> 01:00:32,116
MARISHA: Percy,

871
01:00:32,116 --> 01:00:33,024
TALIESIN: What?

872
01:00:33,024 --> 01:00:33,805
MARISHA: Percy.

873
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:34,390
LIAM: Well, you're the expert.

874
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,302
TALIESIN: No. Yes. What?

875
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:43,538
MARISHA: Look, you can turn this to your
advantage.

876
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:46,165
Brain drain him for all the knowledge you can!

877
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:47,639
TALIESIN: I think we've already done that.

878
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:50,095
MARISHA: All right.

879
01:00:50,095 --> 01:00:54,446
TALIESIN: I think that was an oyster we've already
supped upon.

880
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,765
MARISHA: I trust your judgement.

881
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:57,125
TALIESIN: Ah yes, that got weird.

882
01:00:57,125 --> 01:01:01,997
I'm gonna flip on the cloak by the way, now that
we are well out of that area.

883
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:02,866
MATT: Okay.

884
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:05,545
LAURA: Is anyone following us from the Scarbearers?

885
01:01:05,613 --> 01:01:07,155
MATT: The eye that you have been keeping out,
you don't notice

886
01:01:07,155 --> 01:01:09,740
anyone giving chase or following you.

887
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,257
LIAM: Walking with Kelyeth.

888
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:17,337
You know I don't know anything about that shit,
but in my experience talent and skill have

889
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:20,915
nothing to do with whether you're a douchenozzle
or not. He seems like a schmuck.

890
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:23,043
MARISHA: Oh, he's definitely a douchenozzle.

891
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:23,755
LIAM: Yeah.

892
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:26,590
MARISHA: (gasps) I think that's the first time I
said douchenozzle.

893
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,963
TALIESIN: I think it actually is.

894
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:29,679
LIAM: He called you 'antlers'.

895
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,764
MARISHA: Yeah he called you 'little elf-girl and
little elf-boy'. I don't like him.

896
01:01:34,764 --> 01:01:37,115
LIAM: Mm.

897
01:01:37,115 --> 01:01:39,313
MARISHA: What's wrong with my antlers?

898
01:01:39,313 --> 01:01:40,474
LIAM: Nothing at all

899
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:43,342
MARISHA: I know my hair's shorter so it makes my
antlers look bigger, which I was concerned about.

900
01:01:43,342 --> 01:01:45,179
LIAM: No, they're very attractive I'm sure you
heard---

901
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:46,639
MARISHA: Is it okay?

902
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,647
LIAM: Okay? It's your best feature.

903
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:52,206
MARISHA: Thanks?

904
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:57,609
LAURA: I like your face more than your antlers,
but both are nice, dear.

905
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:59,323
LIAM: No, definitely the antlers.

906
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:02,716
MARISHA: All right, you know what? Let's move off
this conversation.

907
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:06,240
LAURA: I just wanted to ask Tary.

908
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,474
SAM: Oh, yes?

909
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:12,283
LAURA: So your... Doty? Yes?

910
01:02:12,283 --> 01:02:13,201
MARISHA: Dottie.

911
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:14,132
LAURA: Dottie, sorry.

912
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:15,037
SAM: Doty.

913
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:16,124
LIAM: Duty.

914
01:02:16,124 --> 01:02:21,003
LAURA: Duty. Got it. Does he fight or does he just
write?

915
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,097
SAM: He does what I tell him to do.

916
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:24,997
LAURA: Is he competent in a battle?

917
01:02:24,997 --> 01:02:26,512
SAM: I would say so.

918
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:29,583
LAURA: Has he ever been in battle?

919
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,595
SAM: Doty has been in a battle.

920
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:34,537
LAURA: Does he look like he has any battle scars?

921
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:39,001
MATT: Glancing over and getting a quick look--
make a perception check actually.

922
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:40,575
LAURA: All right, just doing some--

923
01:02:40,575 --> 01:02:42,225
TRAVIS: Roll your new dice to redeem it for that
shit--

924
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,507
LAURA: (yells)

925
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:44,430
TRAVIS: Should have done it.

926
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,453
LAURA: No no no, at least it's not a one. 20.

927
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:51,437
MATT: Okay, glancing over and giving a once over
of the giant mechanical creature

928
01:02:51,437 --> 01:02:57,006
(footsteps) walking a few feet behind you,
you can see there are a lot of signs of repair.

929
01:02:57,006 --> 01:03:01,918
You can see there are a lot of places where bits
of metal have been re-hammered. Elements have been

930
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:07,451
patched over, and additional layers of armor have
been added to it. You do see what appear to be

931
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:13,677
some scrapes and areas where it has sustained
various weapon attacks. That whole circumstance.

932
01:03:13,677 --> 01:03:16,849
It looks like it's seen some scuffles in it's
time.

933
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,563
LAURA: Duty looks... worn.

934
01:03:18,563 --> 01:03:19,706
SAM: Doty.

935
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:27,074
LAURA: Doty, my apologies. He looks worn.
Old, far older than your armor.

936
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:36,007
SAM: That may be because in battle I am deft,
fearless.

937
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:37,391
TRAVIS: You're deaf?

938
01:03:37,391 --> 01:03:48,492
SAM: No deft, with a T. I can dodge blows
uncannily. I can anticipate what my opponent is

939
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,106
going to do ahead of time and dodge out of the
way.

940
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:52,440
LAURA: I can see that about you.

941
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,039
SAM: Yes.

942
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,545
LAURA: You seem very dexterous too.

943
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:56,845
SAM: I think I am.

944
01:03:56,845 --> 01:04:01,623
LAURA: Yes. Did Doty raise you? Is he like your
nanny?

945
01:04:01,623 --> 01:04:05,660
SAM: No, he's a mechanical construct that I made,
he did not--

946
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:10,670
LAURA: That you made when you were two? Because he
looks like he raised you.

947
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:18,443
SAM: Doty did not raise me. He is a mechanical
construct that I built when I learned how.

948
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:20,128
LIAM: Does he cook?

949
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:21,240
SAM: He does not cook.

950
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,174
LIAM: Does he clean?

951
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:24,347
SAM: He could clean. I---

952
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:25,867
LIAM: Keep you warm at night?

953
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:27,610
SAM: No, he's cold as ice.

954
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,112
LAURA: How old were you when you built him?

955
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:31,000
SAM: Well I'm 28 now.

956
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,716
LAURA: Yes?

957
01:04:31,716 --> 01:04:34,058
SAM: So that would have been 27.

958
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,500
LAURA: He's a year old?

959
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,663
SAM: He's a year old.

960
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,402
LAURA: And he only talks to you?

961
01:04:39,402 --> 01:04:41,502
SAM: Nope. He doesn't talk to me.

962
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,782
LAURA: Oh, he only listens to you.

963
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:54,252
SAM: He's the best really. Fearless, strong, big,
and excellent penmanship. He's everything

964
01:04:54,252 --> 01:04:59,406
I could hope for in a friend. Silent.

965
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:03,314
MARISHA: Were pen pals a thing for you? Is that
why you like penmanship?

966
01:05:03,314 --> 01:05:07,183
SAM: I mean, no. I don't think I ever had a
penpal.

967
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:09,562
MARISHA: No? Did you have any friends? Ever?

968
01:05:09,562 --> 01:05:11,016
LIAM: Or siblings?

969
01:05:11,016 --> 01:05:13,954
SAM: I had tutors. I had the best teachers.
I had--

970
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:16,271
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww...

971
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:23,945
SAM: --wonderful. No, no! Don't 'aww'. They were
wonderfully smart and engaging, but my best

972
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:27,746
friends were the books I read.

973
01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:30,049
LIAM: What were Mom and Dad like?

974
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:33,259
SAM: They're still alive. There's no were.
They are wonderful people my father--

975
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,697
LIAM: I mean when you were a tyke.

976
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:46,489
SAM: (sighs) My father is a very talented
businessman. He can be hard at times. He has great

977
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:49,647
expectations for everyone he meets.

978
01:05:49,647 --> 01:06:00,190
My mother is... a saint; she's perfect in every
way. She's a wonderful person and... yes.

979
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,887
MARISHA: Really? And they're still alive? Weren't
killed in some crazy raid, or... eaten by dragons

980
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:07,165
or...fell in a pit of lava?

981
01:06:07,165 --> 01:06:09,472
SAM: No, they are eagerly awaiting me to arrive
back at home

982
01:06:09,472 --> 01:06:12,279
and tell them tales of my journeys and adventures.

983
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:14,735
LIAM: What is your father's business?

984
01:06:14,735 --> 01:06:16,953
SAM: He is a businessman.

985
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:19,695
LIAM: A businessman? Is that a taboo subject with
you?

986
01:06:19,695 --> 01:06:25,172
SAM:  No! Not at all. It's just, I'm not sure how
well versed you are in financial transactions.

987
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:28,676
LIAM: Oh, fuck-all. I thought you could
give me the layman's terms.

988
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:36,687
SAM: He is in real estate. He buys and sells
properties, charges rent, taxes...

989
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:37,855
LIAM: A land baron.

990
01:06:37,855 --> 01:06:39,151
TRAVIS: So bored right now.

991
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:45,502
SAM: He owns a lot of things, places and makes a
lot of money off of these places.

992
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:50,148
LIAM: Interesting... Interesting.

993
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:51,475
TRAVIS: Cinnamon Tower.

994
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:56,183
SAM: I will be forthcoming with anything that you
ask me.

995
01:06:56,183 --> 01:07:01,795
I have nothing to hide. I come from money; this is clear.

996
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:03,669
LIAM: Can I insight check him on 'I have
nothing'?

997
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:06,895
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

998
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:07,633
LAURA: Aw.

999
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:08,866
LIAM: It's terrible, that's all right.

1000
01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:10,274
LAURA: No, it's not! Don't use luck!

1001
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:11,186
LIAM: You shush!

1002
01:07:11,186 --> 01:07:11,789
LAURA: You can--

1003
01:07:11,789 --> 01:07:17,462
LIAM: I will use luck if I want to use luck!

1004
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:20,373
MATT: Hard to read. For many reasons!

1005
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:22,631
LIAM: I'll say!

1006
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:27,190
TALIESIN: I also want to take a good long look at
robot and see if I can-- this automaton.

1007
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,281
MATT:  Okay. Investigation check.

1008
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:35,514
TALIESIN: Come on. (sighs) Okay, 13.

1009
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:38,069
MATT: What are you trying to ascertain about it?

1010
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:42,248
TALIESIN: How old it is, how it was built,
where it was built. Just to get a sense of it,

1011
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:45,060
like looking over a classic car.

1012
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:50,254
MATT: Best that you can tell from its construction
and your understanding, there is a lot of

1013
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:58,950
ingenuity in its design. But it is, it exists,
and moves through a combination of decent

1014
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,446
engineering and enchantment.

1015
01:08:01,446 --> 01:08:03,927
TALIESIN: Oh thank God! Okay, I feel better.

1016
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:10,864
MATT: You can see very, very faint engravings of
various runic glyphs that are similar

1017
01:08:10,864 --> 01:08:12,773
some of the ones that you saw on--

1018
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:13,963
TALIESIN: Fassbender?

1019
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:14,744
MATT: -- Fassbender.

1020
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:20,123
TALIESIN: All right. I feel better already,
thank you. Ego restored.

1021
01:08:20,123 --> 01:08:22,599
LIAM: (sings the Legend of Zelda 'item' tune)

1022
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,173
MATT: You guys make your way to the Sand Herald
District and there you can see the distant towers

1023
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:31,969
of the Cerulean Place. The large central one that
leads up into the chamber of J'mon Sa Ord.

1024
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:36,496
As you approach the outside, you see the familiar
faces and armor of the Hands of Ord there,

1025
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:43,311
guarding the exterior of the palace walls.
As you approach, one of the guards steps up with

1026
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:47,254
their same kind of brass and sapphire emblazoned
armor,

1027
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,141
and one of them approaches and steps forward.

1028
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:55,134
"I'm sorry. Do you have business at the palace?"

1029
01:08:55,134 --> 01:09:00,757
LAURA: Yes. Question: the symbol? Scanlan?

1030
01:09:00,826 --> 01:09:02,515
LIAM: Scanlan had it...

1031
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,398
LAURA: That's what I thought.

1032
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:05,757
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking shit.

1033
01:09:05,757 --> 01:09:07,530
MARISHA: I thought we got it back, though.

1034
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:10,414
LAURA: Did he give back to us or did he not?

1035
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:14,650
MARISHA: Wait, no. Are we talking about the
flute?

1036
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,416
LIAM: No, there was a symbol.

1037
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,018
LAURA: Remember the symbol that had--

1038
01:09:19,018 --> 01:09:20,521
LIAM: J'mon's symbol to show to all friends.

1039
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,089
TALIESIN:I think he still has the symbol,
doesn't he?

1040
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:24,258
MARISHA: I have his flute because I picked it up
last.

1041
01:09:24,258 --> 01:09:25,864
LAURA: Yeah, that doesn't have his symbol on it
though.

1042
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:27,232
LIAM: That's not the same thing.

1043
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:29,751
TALIESIN: We do bring news though, so...

1044
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:32,018
MARISHA: Fuck!

1045
01:09:32,018 --> 01:09:42,288
LIAM: We are friends to-- the man on top.
J'mon, I misspoke.

1046
01:09:42,288 --> 01:09:43,590
LAURA: J'mon Sa Ord.

1047
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,118
MARISHA: We need to speak with him.

1048
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:46,893
LIAM: Vox Machina is here, he knows us.

1049
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:51,180
MARISHA: And return this: I show the flute.
Maybe they'll recognize it?

1050
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:52,843
MATT:  The guard takes the flute and--

1051
01:09:52,843 --> 01:09:59,482
MARISHA: I take it and I dust the ash and drug use
off of it. And then--

1052
01:09:59,482 --> 01:10:02,197
MATT: The guard takes it and looks at it, 
confused.

1053
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:06,544
"Please to be patient, for just a moment."

1054
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:08,477
LAURA: Of course, be pleased!

1055
01:10:08,477 --> 01:10:10,380
MATT: "Be pleased."

1056
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,807
Turns around and walks back up the stairs,
the front of the palace, and enters through

1057
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:18,191
one of the side doorways. About two, three 
minutes pass.

1058
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:23,376
The guards just keep a view out, and then
eventually you see an older woman in familiar

1059
01:10:23,376 --> 01:10:28,250
ceremonial robes exit from the doorway that the
guard went into. This is the Grand Maven,

1060
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,950
Gameshega, who you met and escorted you up into
the palace originally. She walks up with her

1061
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:38,115
bracelets still jingling as she steps down the
stairs, her long robes trailing behind her a good

1062
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:43,773
like two-three feet. Her headdress still has
little brass quills that streak down, past her

1063
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:47,175
shoulders into her mid-back, and as she steps up:

1064
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:50,641
"It is good to see all of you once more.

1065
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:55,832
"I do not believe we have met, I'm sorry,
what is your name?"

1066
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:57,955
SAM: Taryon Darrington. Nice to meet you.
Be pleased.

1067
01:10:57,955 --> 01:11:05,216
MATT: Taryon Darrington, friend of Vox Machina,
it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

1068
01:11:05,216 --> 01:11:11,367
So J'mon would like to extend their greetings to
all of you,

1069
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:16,876
and respect in the wake of the news of the
destruction of the Conclave.

1070
01:11:16,876 --> 01:11:24,008
You've aided in closing a far too lingering
chapter in the history of Marquet and the ruin of

1071
01:11:24,008 --> 01:11:27,101
the Cinder King. Thank you.

1072
01:11:27,101 --> 01:11:29,846
SAM: You're welcome.

1073
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:35,521
TALIESIN: We wanted to make sure that they were
aware that all of the dragons had been dealt with,

1074
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:38,190
and that the Conclave had been completely
vanquished.

1075
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,822
MATT: This information did make it to the ears of
J'mon.

1076
01:11:40,822 --> 01:11:45,126
TALIESIN: Excellent. And we thank you 
for your time.

1077
01:11:45,387 --> 01:11:48,432
MATT: Of course. Anything else?

1078
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:50,768
LAURA: Um.

1079
01:11:50,768 --> 01:11:52,249
MARISHA: I guess not?

1080
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:58,525
LAURA: Well, could I take you aside for a
moment?

1081
01:11:58,525 --> 01:12:00,773
MATT: "Of course, my dear."

1082
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:05,039
And she walks alongside you as you pull her off a
little bit.

1083
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:11,371
LAURA: We have in our service, in Emon, a
wonderful man, who has been of great aid in

1084
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:22,889
battling the Conclave as well, and we learned
recently that he was expelled from Marquet due

1085
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:31,054
to crimes in his youth and was wondering if we
could maybe speak in his name and his regard,

1086
01:12:31,054 --> 01:12:34,507
to you, to clear his name?

1087
01:12:34,507 --> 01:12:37,896
MATT: I can see what I can do. What is the name
of this gentleman?

1088
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:40,981
LAURA: Jarett. His last name?

1089
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:43,360
LIAM: Serpersveshzhg?

1090
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,523
SAM: Anderson?

1091
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:45,531
MARISHA: Howarth.

1092
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:46,762
LAURA: Jarett...

1093
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,217
MARISHA: Howarth. Howarth.

1094
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:49,040
MATT: There you go.

1095
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,807
LAURA: Jarett Howorth?

1096
01:12:49,807 --> 01:12:50,636
MARISHA: Howarth.

1097
01:12:50,636 --> 01:12:51,546
LAURA: Jarett Howarth.

1098
01:12:51,546 --> 01:12:52,624
SAM: You have his name?

1099
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:53,911
LAURA: Of course she does, because she takes
killer notes.

1100
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,020
SAM: Holy Bajoly!

1101
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,641
TALIESIN: She writes everything down.

1102
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:58,699
SAM: I didn't know that he had a name!

1103
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:01,614
MATT: Jarrett Howarth.

1104
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:02,287
LAURA: Yes.

1105
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:07,121
MATT: Okay. I will go and take this into the
archives, discover and see what can be done.

1106
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:12,051
LAURA: Thank you so much. If you find out
anything, will you please send word?

1107
01:13:12,051 --> 01:13:14,623
MATT: Yes, should we be sending it to Emon as
well?

1108
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,570
LAURA: If you could, send it to Whitestone?

1109
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,658
MATT: To Whitestone?

1110
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:18,632
LAURA: That would be wonderful.

1111
01:13:18,632 --> 01:13:23,468
MATT: Okay. Very well.
We have not sent anything to Whitestone before.

1112
01:13:23,468 --> 01:13:25,210
We will find a way to do so.

1113
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,906
LAURA: It's an up and coming city. Very prominent
on Tal'dorei.

1114
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:29,203
TALIESIN: It's on the move.

1115
01:13:29,203 --> 01:13:32,543
LAURA: It's on the move.

1116
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:37,464
LIAM: Would you send J'mon, would you send
them our thanks?

1117
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:43,082
MATT: I will do this. I apologize, J'mon is not
currently taking audiences.

1118
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:43,973
LAURA: Totally fine.

1119
01:13:43,973 --> 01:13:48,056
MATT: But I will continue to pass this word onto
them.

1120
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,136
LAURA: Thank you so much.

1121
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:51,673
MATT: Thank you very much. And good day! Be
pleased.

1122
01:13:51,673 --> 01:13:52,726
LAURA: Be pleased.

1123
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:55,154
TRAVIS: Beep-beep!

1124
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:58,757
MATT: As the Grand Maven turns around and heads
back up the stairs, the guards take their place

1125
01:13:58,757 --> 01:14:04,111
and the palace is at rest.

1126
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,160
LAURA: Welp.

1127
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,061
TRAVIS: He must be sick.

1128
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:07,744
LAURA: Probably.

1129
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:09,185
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1130
01:14:09,185 --> 01:14:10,689
TALIESIN: The flu, perhaps.

1131
01:14:10,689 --> 01:14:11,918
MARISHA: It's been going around.

1132
01:14:11,918 --> 01:14:14,256
LAURA: Lots of travel happening. Happens when you
travel, I hear.

1133
01:14:14,256 --> 01:14:18,326
MARISHA: It's true, yeah. Anytime you fly.

1134
01:14:18,326 --> 01:14:23,605
TALIESIN: So I think that concludes this little
jaunt, it might be back home now.

1135
01:14:23,605 --> 01:14:26,322
LAURA: Oh jeez.

1136
01:14:26,322 --> 01:14:31,364
TRAVIS: Well, I think it's about time that we see
what Tary Jumbo's worth.

1137
01:14:31,364 --> 01:14:32,479
SAM: I'm sorry?

1138
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,217
TRAVIS: One of your things on your list, right,
it was to get in a kerfuffle?

1139
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:38,663
SAM: There's no kerfuffle on the list--

1140
01:14:38,663 --> 01:14:39,841
TRAVIS: Riff-ram, bah-zhu.

1141
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:44,055
SAM: --but we are going to have an adventure,
is that right?

1142
01:14:44,055 --> 01:14:44,747
LAURA: So many.

1143
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:45,535
SAM: At some point?

1144
01:14:45,535 --> 01:14:46,408
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

1145
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:47,209
LAURA: All of them.

1146
01:14:47,209 --> 01:14:50,170
LIAM: Buddy boy, you're buying in for shit you're
not really ready for, yes.

1147
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:50,978
SAM: All right.

1148
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:52,030
TRAVIS: We gotta know how--

1149
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,751
SAM: So far, we've delivered a dead body part to
someone,

1150
01:14:56,751 --> 01:15:00,310
and had a brief conversation with a guard.

1151
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,873
TALIESIN: It's only been two hours.

1152
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:05,490
SAM: Is this what you all are about?

1153
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:11,415
LIAM: We're gonna take a little time for a day.
And then we're gonna take you to hell.

1154
01:15:11,415 --> 01:15:12,308
SAM: All right.

1155
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:13,521
LIAM: How does that sound?

1156
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:15,324
SAM: Are you speaking metaphorically?

1157
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:16,410
TRAVIS: No, no, literally hell.

1158
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:17,797
TALIESIN: No, we're going to hell.

1159
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:19,594
TRAVIS: There's like seven or eleven of them.

1160
01:15:19,594 --> 01:15:20,939
SAM: All right.

1161
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:22,633
LIAM: Wow.

1162
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:24,752
TRAVIS: Are those together? Close?

1163
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,230
LAURA: Very big numbers, Grog.

1164
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,523
LIAM: Sure.

1165
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,634
TALIESIN: We're taking this one to hell then?

1166
01:15:29,634 --> 01:15:31,768
MARISHA: Might be a good trial run.

1167
01:15:31,768 --> 01:15:34,273
LIAM: I don't know. Do you want to put him through
his paces?

1168
01:15:34,273 --> 01:15:35,299
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.

1169
01:15:35,299 --> 01:15:36,600
LIAM: Yeah.

1170
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,442
MARISHA: I want to save traveling the Ozmit Sea
and heading

1171
01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:44,236
to the water Ashari for when Pike is back.

1172
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:45,023
LAURA: Yeah.

1173
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,798
LIAM: Yeah.

1174
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:46,991
MARISHA: So, yeah.

1175
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:49,117
LIAM: Yeah. Let's take this fucker to hell.

1176
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:50,937
SAM: I don't know what you're talking about.

1177
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:55,670
MARISHA: No, we're speaking insanely literally
right now. That's what's impressive about it.

1178
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:56,535
SAM: I...

1179
01:15:56,535 --> 01:16:00,890
LIAM: We are going to Hell.

1180
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,157
SAM: All right.

1181
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,851
LIAM: And you are coming along.

1182
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:05,491
MARISHA: And we're taking you with us.

1183
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:06,864
LAURA: Shouldn't we see him fight first?

1184
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:08,381
LIAM: Yeah, well, let's bring him home.

1185
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:09,821
LAURA: I'd hate for him to die immediately.

1186
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:12,803
LIAM: Yeah, we want Grog to run him out like a
labrador.

1187
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:16,421
TRAVIS: Do I see any large, intimidating looking
creatures

1188
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:18,837
just walking around where we are at the moment?

1189
01:16:18,837 --> 01:16:20,204
LAURA: No, not in the city, Grog.

1190
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:21,944
TRAVIS: I'm not talking to you.

1191
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:25,052
MATT: Make a perception check.

1192
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:28,448
LIAM: He only has to listen to you at home.

1193
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:29,420
LAURA: I know.

1194
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,426
TRAVIS: 12.

1195
01:16:30,426 --> 01:16:34,344
MATT: Uh, best that you can tell here in the Sand
Herald district, no. Most everyone who wanders

1196
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:39,003
around here are of noble dress or part of the Hand
of Ord.

1197
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:41,127
TRAVIS: You see that fruit merchant over there?

1198
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:44,354
SAM: Yes.

1199
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:48,106
TRAVIS: Killed many, many people.

1200
01:16:48,106 --> 01:16:56,695
SAM: Oh, well maybe I should pay him to take me on
an adventure because Jesus Christ. This is about

1201
01:16:56,695 --> 01:17:01,292
as fucking boring as I can get.

1202
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:05,999
TRAVIS: I might just hit him. I might just attack
him.

1203
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:08,693
LAURA: Hey! You know what you can cross off your
list?

1204
01:17:08,693 --> 01:17:10,412
Teleportation, because that's what we're
about to do.

1205
01:17:10,412 --> 01:17:11,399
SAM: No, really?

1206
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:12,048
LAURA: Oh yeah.

1207
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:12,791
MARISHA: It's true.

1208
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,623
SAM: It's on my list; it's literally on my list.

1209
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,273
LAURA: I know.

1210
01:17:15,273 --> 01:17:18,191
MARISHA: Wait what? All right, let's go.

1211
01:17:18,252 --> 01:17:20,366
SAM: All right, all right, all right! Finally
getting my money's worth.

1212
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:22,312
MARISHA: So we're going back to Whitestone?

1213
01:17:22,364 --> 01:17:23,509
TALIESIN: Yes, Whitestone.

1214
01:17:23,509 --> 01:17:25,908
LIAM: Yes, get your big boy pants on, Ermergerd.

1215
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:26,854
SAM: It's Taryon!

1216
01:17:26,854 --> 01:17:28,634
MARISHA: Come on, Doodee.

1217
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:30,602
SAM: Doty.

1218
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:37,437
MATT: All right, as you find a familiar tree you
can utilize to transport over to Whitestone,

1219
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:43,117
Tary you watch as the center of this tree's trunk
suddenly seems to split open with divine energy.

1220
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:43,882
SAM: Cool.

1221
01:17:43,882 --> 01:17:47,717
MATT: On the opposite side, you watch this tunnel
progress about four or five feet within where it

1222
01:17:47,717 --> 01:17:52,478
just looks like the striations of the interior of
the tree trunk before it emerges on the other side

1223
01:17:52,478 --> 01:17:56,006
into another town square currently in the middle
of an evening.

1224
01:17:56,006 --> 01:18:00,423
SAM: Doty, take this down. As the tree split in
front of me--

1225
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:01,541
TALIESIN: I shove him through.

1226
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:03,634
SAM: Ahhh!

1227
01:18:03,634 --> 01:18:06,363
MARISHA: You have six seconds!

1228
01:18:06,363 --> 01:18:10,595
MATT: As you all tumble through the Transport via
Plants spell, you all emerge on the opposite side

1229
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:16,597
of the Sun Tree in the center of Whitestone's
courtyard. What do you wish to do?

1230
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:23,039
SAM: Oh my. Oh my gods. Where are we? What's going
on?  What happened?

1231
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,725
Where am I? Is this a fantasy world? 
What happened?

1232
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:27,946
MARISHA: Are you feeling nauseous?

1233
01:18:27,946 --> 01:18:28,534
LIAM: Whack!

1234
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:30,181
SAM: Ahh!

1235
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:31,343
TALIESIN: How about now?

1236
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:37,285
SAM: Wow! That was exhilarating! It's like my body
fell apart and came back together again!

1237
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:38,332
LAURA: That's exactly what it was like.

1238
01:18:38,332 --> 01:18:39,709
SAM: It was amazing!

1239
01:18:39,709 --> 01:18:40,910
LIAM: I've never had that.

1240
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,398
LAURA: Or it was like walking forward.

1241
01:18:42,398 --> 01:18:45,281
LIAM: Yeah. I've never had that sensation ever
before. Ever.

1242
01:18:45,281 --> 01:18:51,664
SAM: I felt a great force behind me, pushing me
forward! And then all of a sudden I opened my eyes

1243
01:18:51,664 --> 01:19:01,251
and was in a new place. Doty, take this down.
Today is the greatest day of Taryon Darrington's

1244
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:11,041
life. The day that he experienced the wonder of
the gods. That's enough for now.

1245
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:17,480
MARISHA: Oh my god, did you guys hear that? He
thinks I'm a god. Doucher!

1246
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,576
TRAVIS: Douchenozzle.

1247
01:19:18,576 --> 01:19:23,202
MARISHA: Douchenozzle, that's right! That's what
it was. Sorry, I'm just learning it.

1248
01:19:23,202 --> 01:19:25,140
LAURA: What time is it here?

1249
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,335
MATT: Technically now that I think about it,
it would still be day, because you guys left in

1250
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:30,439
the morning to Ank'Harel, and you've been there
for a few hours,

1251
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:32,727
so it's early afternoon at this point.

1252
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:36,442
LAURA: Okay. Oh, fabulous. All right.

1253
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:37,933
TRAVIS: So we're back on home turf, right?

1254
01:19:37,933 --> 01:19:39,576
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to take this guy to a
field and kick his ass,

1255
01:19:39,576 --> 01:19:40,771
or what are we going to do?

1256
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:41,845
TRAVIS: Yeah, I kind of want to.

1257
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:43,557
LAURA: Oh, can I go find Jarett really fast?

1258
01:19:43,557 --> 01:19:47,493
MATT: Yeah, it's easy enough to find. You head
down to where the makeshift garrison, which has

1259
01:19:47,493 --> 01:19:52,485
now seen reconstruction, actually being turned
into a decent functional garrison within the town

1260
01:19:52,485 --> 01:19:56,117
itself. A lot of the guards are out there running
through their drills for the afternoon, and you

1261
01:19:56,182 --> 01:20:01,206
can see Jarrett is in the process of running them
through what looks like

1262
01:20:01,206 --> 01:20:07,008
ranged combat training. As you approach,
Jarett looks over and watches you walking up from

1263
01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:08,132
a distance and kind of gives a wave,

1264
01:20:08,132 --> 01:20:09,563
"Hello!"

1265
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:11,204
LAURA: Hi.

1266
01:20:11,204 --> 01:20:16,886
MATT: "So, everything seems to be in order here.
I have to say, I am very glad to know that we

1267
01:20:16,965 --> 01:20:19,081
"have no more dragons for quite some time."

1268
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:26,341
And you see he's recovering; he's healing,
but there is noticeable scarring on the side of

1269
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:30,349
his neck. And it looks like he's going through the
process of recovering from the Thordak battle,

1270
01:20:30,349 --> 01:20:32,734
but he's doing much better than the last time you
saw him.

1271
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:34,949
LAURA: How are you mentally?

1272
01:20:34,949 --> 01:20:41,087
MATT: To be perfectly honest, very happy to not
be anywhere near that terrible city. I never

1273
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:46,800
thought I had the sense for the slower parts of
the countryside, but I don't know; I've come to

1274
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,657
like it here in Whitestone.

1275
01:20:48,657 --> 01:20:51,969
LAURA: It is quite nice. Well, you're welcome to
stay.

1276
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:53,959
MATT: Well, I was intending to.

1277
01:20:53,959 --> 01:20:57,152
LAURA: We are planning to rebuild our home in Emon
as well.

1278
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,109
MATT: Yes, yes.

1279
01:20:58,109 --> 01:21:00,056
LAURA: So it's up to you where you'd like to be.

1280
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:06,453
MATT: Really, you employ me so it is more up to
you, but I kind of like the change in temperature.

1281
01:21:06,453 --> 01:21:07,586
LAURA: I do too.

1282
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,334
MATT: Bit chillier up here, north.

1283
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:11,865
LAURA: Well, in case you're wondering, we just
came from Marquet.

1284
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:12,849
MATT: Oh?

1285
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:17,768
LAURA: Where we spoke with the Grand Maven?

1286
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:18,705
MATT: Right?

1287
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:25,949
LAURA: Of J'mon Sa Ord. Spoke very highly of you
and she's working on getting your name cleared.

1288
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:27,447
MATT: Really?

1289
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:30,295
LAURA: Well, she said she would. I don't know what
you did, dear,

1290
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:33,253
but hopefully it wasn't anything too terrible.

1291
01:21:33,253 --> 01:21:35,999
LIAM: Serial killer.

1292
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:38,447
MATT: He doesn't look nervous at all, he looks
elated and is like,

1293
01:21:38,447 --> 01:21:48,460
"Well, thank you. I hope that comes to a fruitful
end. I've been living here long enough where it's

1294
01:21:48,525 --> 01:21:51,386
"not a huge deal to me, but it would be nice to
occasionally return--"

1295
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:52,254
LAURA: See home?

1296
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:53,189
MATT: Yeah. You know.

1297
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:54,523
LAURA: That's nice.

1298
01:21:54,523 --> 01:21:55,944
MATT: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1299
01:21:55,944 --> 01:22:07,813
LAURA: Of course. And you may not have heard,
but our resident bard has left us. Possibly for

1300
01:22:07,813 --> 01:22:14,834
the time being, possibly for more. So you won't be
seeing his face around here.

1301
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:17,986
MATT: I am sorry to hear that.

1302
01:22:17,986 --> 01:22:21,142
LAURA: I only tell you because I saw you speaking
with him several times

1303
01:22:21,142 --> 01:22:25,790
and thought you might want to know.

1304
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:32,327
MATT: This is good to know. Well, I look forward
to his return.

1305
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,478
That being the case, can I ask a favor of you?

1306
01:22:34,478 --> 01:22:35,519
LAURA: Of course.

1307
01:22:35,519 --> 01:22:37,443
MATT: "Could you hold this?"

1308
01:22:37,443 --> 01:22:39,910
And he reaches back and pulls out a small pouch
and puts it in your hand.

1309
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:42,095
"I don't feel comfortable holding on to this."

1310
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:43,604
LAURA: What is it?

1311
01:22:43,604 --> 01:22:51,674
MATT: It was requested by your small bard friend
and I probably should not have it on my person.

1312
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:52,765
LAURA: Requested?

1313
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:53,660
MATT: Yes.

1314
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:58,043
LAURA: What is it? Components of a potion? I
don't...

1315
01:22:58,109 --> 01:23:00,432
MATT: One that you should not probably drink.

1316
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,822
LAURA: What is it, Jarrett?

1317
01:23:02,822 --> 01:23:06,196
MATT: It's suude. It's illegal. You should not--
It is dangerous.

1318
01:23:06,196 --> 01:23:07,514
LAURA: It's drugs?

1319
01:23:07,514 --> 01:23:14,796
MATT: Yes! Yes it is! Let's talk about it in
front of everyone I'm training! Yes, thank you!

1320
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:15,876
LAURA: I put it in my pocket.

1321
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:16,838
MATT: Don't do drugs!

1322
01:23:16,838 --> 01:23:18,513
LAURA: Don't do drugs!

1323
01:23:18,513 --> 01:23:24,719
Scanlan was doing drugs? Jarett, you sold Scanlan
drugs?

1324
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,246
MATT: No, I procured them for him at his
request.

1325
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:31,115
LAURA: Is this why you were expelled from
Marquet?

1326
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:32,825
MATT: (unconvincingly) No.

1327
01:23:32,825 --> 01:23:41,201
(all laugh)

1328
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:47,058
MATT: There are a number of reasons.

1329
01:23:47,058 --> 01:23:50,109
LAURA: How long have you been providing this to
him?

1330
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:56,091
MATT: This was only the second. I did not want to
do this! He is a very convincing person and looked

1331
01:23:56,091 --> 01:23:57,715
like he was going through a hard time.

1332
01:23:57,715 --> 01:23:58,553
LAURA: Yes, he is.

1333
01:23:58,553 --> 01:24:01,898
MATT: And look, I understand that, and I warned
him. He knew full well the dangers involved; he's

1334
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:07,531
a much stronger man than I am. Who was I to tell
him this? And he's very persuasive.

1335
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:11,928
LAURA: He is. When was the first time you gave it
to him?

1336
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:17,546
MATT: Not more than maybe a week or two ago?

1337
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:22,458
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you for giving them to
me.

1338
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:26,215
MATT: Yes, it was burning a hole in my pocket.
And I don't want to hold onto it.

1339
01:24:26,215 --> 01:24:28,762
LAURA: I understand.

1340
01:24:28,762 --> 01:24:31,559
MATT: Sorry.

1341
01:24:31,559 --> 01:24:33,788
LAURA: I appreciate your service, Jarrett.

1342
01:24:33,788 --> 01:24:38,511
MATT: I appreciate your understanding.

1343
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:41,215
LAURA: Get better. Keep training.

1344
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:42,590
MATT: Yes, I should do that.

1345
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:44,051
LAURA: All right.

1346
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:46,449
MATT: He turns around,

1347
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:50,244
"You lot heard nothing! Nock your crossbows,
nock--"

1348
01:24:50,426 --> 01:24:52,437
(whack) and slaps one guy on the back of the head.

1349
01:24:52,437 --> 01:24:54,427
"All right. Focus up, on the targets,"

1350
01:24:54,427 --> 01:24:56,379
and you hear him begin taking a few volleys off in
the distance

1351
01:24:56,379 --> 01:25:00,649
as you walk your way back to the castle.

1352
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:05,497
The rest of you, as you walk through
Whitestone, Taryon, you watch this beautiful,

1353
01:25:05,497 --> 01:25:09,486
wonderfully slightly backwards city--

1354
01:25:09,486 --> 01:25:11,721
TALIESIN: Hey! Okay...

1355
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:12,943
SAM: It's amazing.

1356
01:25:12,943 --> 01:25:13,948
MATT: It's charming.

1357
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:15,638
SAM: Yes, quaint really.

1358
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:18,984
MATT: Yeah! And there's a castle. They have a
castle!

1359
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:22,449
SAM: Tourists must love it here.

1360
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:26,507
TALIESIN: We do quite well... in the on season.

1361
01:25:26,507 --> 01:25:28,275
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. In years ago.

1362
01:25:28,275 --> 01:25:32,867
TRAVIS: Do you mind if you come to the outskirts
of the city with us?

1363
01:25:32,867 --> 01:25:36,144
SAM: I literally know nothing about this city.

1364
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:42,078
TRAVIS: Great, yeah, come with us. Just Vax knows
the way, Vax will you... You know? The spot?

1365
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:44,808
LIAM: The beautiful parts of the city, actually,
are the countryside,

1366
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:48,722
the woods around. It's drab in the middle.

1367
01:25:48,722 --> 01:25:50,238
SAM: I paid for adventure.

1368
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:51,368
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's out there.

1369
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:52,787
LIAM: And adventure you shall have, my friend.

1370
01:25:52,787 --> 01:25:54,250
SAM: All right.

1371
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:59,255
TRAVIS: So can we find our way to like a fairly
open and not populated part of Whitestone?

1372
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:04,659
MATT: Yeah. Your best bet, at this point,
would be to make your way to the unclaimed

1373
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,572
gardens in the back of the castle.

1374
01:26:06,572 --> 01:26:07,627
TALIESIN: I was going to say.

1375
01:26:07,627 --> 01:26:08,478
MARISHA: Castle courtyards.

1376
01:26:08,478 --> 01:26:16,956
MATT: For awhile there was no greenery back there.
The processing and disposing of the excess acids

1377
01:26:16,956 --> 01:26:21,576
lead to the green fume that was billowing behind
the castle when you first arrived here and

1378
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:27,077
destroyed most of the plant life. Through your aid
and the people who kept the castle, those have

1379
01:26:27,077 --> 01:26:31,848
been filled in and it looks like the castle
grounds are starting to recover. There is now a

1380
01:26:31,848 --> 01:26:38,310
fresh growing season of green back there,
and that is closed off. It is protected.

1381
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:41,792
There are guards around and it is away from the
general populace of Whitestone.

1382
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:47,975
TRAVIS: Nice. This looks like a great place.
Now, if you want your first taste of adventure,

1383
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:50,819
you need to bring Dottie and come over here.

1384
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:51,646
SAM: Doty.

1385
01:26:51,646 --> 01:26:55,861
TRAVIS: I have to whisper it because it's very
secret.

1386
01:26:55,861 --> 01:27:06,399
SAM: Four-eyes, shall I trust Jumbo here because
he seems a bit shady.

1387
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:12,624
TALIESIN: Yes, no, you should trust him with your
life. He's very trustworthy.

1388
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:19,427
SAM: I will roll an insight check.

1389
01:27:19,427 --> 01:27:21,458
LIAM: Grog and I are just waiting.

1390
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:23,337
SAM: What do I add to it?

1391
01:27:23,337 --> 01:27:24,760
MATT: Your insight skill.

1392
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:32,800
SAM: Oh yeah, that. I have forgotten how to play
Dungeons and Dragons. 18.

1393
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,781
MATT: Travis, I would like you to roll a
deception.

1394
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:38,428
TALIESIN: Wait, is it Travis or is it me?

1395
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:39,631
LAURA: Is it deception?

1396
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:41,645
MATT: Oh wait, no, it's from you, sorry.
Yeah, this is Percival, technically.

1397
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:43,557
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

1398
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:44,929
MATT: It's kind of both of you.

1399
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:47,169
TRAVIS: Bitch! I rolled a 17.

1400
01:27:47,169 --> 01:27:49,361
LIAM: So Percy at advantage then, right?

1401
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:51,943
MARISHA: You can trust Grog for some things.

1402
01:27:51,943 --> 01:27:52,663
LAURA: You can!

1403
01:27:52,663 --> 01:27:54,533
SAM: Go on!

1404
01:27:54,533 --> 01:27:56,200
TRAVIS: Plus I do want to take him on an
adventure.

1405
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,051
LAURA: I feel like Grog is getting far more
trustworthy.

1406
01:27:58,051 --> 01:27:58,929
MARISHA: I agree!

1407
01:27:58,929 --> 01:27:59,920
TALIESIN: 12.

1408
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,560
MATT: You get the sense that maybe not all the
information is there.

1409
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,289
TALIESIN: It's not a lie.

1410
01:28:05,289 --> 01:28:12,943
MATT: It's not a lie, but it's definitely-- it
speaks of a half truth.

1411
01:28:12,943 --> 01:28:14,995
SAM: What's going on out here?

1412
01:28:14,995 --> 01:28:16,851
TRAVIS: Secret stuff. Are you ready?

1413
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:17,981
SAM: For what?

1414
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:19,177
TRAVIS: Where's Dottie?

1415
01:28:19,177 --> 01:28:21,973
SAM: Doty. He's right behind me, as he always is.

1416
01:28:21,973 --> 01:28:24,524
TRAVIS: Nice. So put out your hand like this.

1417
01:28:24,524 --> 01:28:25,909
SAM: What's going to happen?

1418
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:31,540
TRAVIS: And take your other hand, and you either
make a boulder, a piece of paper, or a pair of

1419
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:35,537
shears. Right? And we do it on three.

1420
01:28:35,537 --> 01:28:38,221
TALIESIN: To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely
sure what's happening either.

1421
01:28:38,221 --> 01:28:39,979
MARISHA: You've never played Boulder, Paper,
Shears?!

1422
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:43,793
(all laugh)

1423
01:28:43,793 --> 01:28:48,146
SAM: That's the best thing you've ever said,
Marisha.

1424
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:58,608
TALIESIN: That just went right up my nose.
It burns. That is not pleasant.

1425
01:28:58,608 --> 01:29:00,836
SAM: Of course I've played Boulder, Paper,
Shears.

1426
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:04,402
TRAVIS: Great, great. It's just to see who goes
first. Ready?

1427
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:05,502
SAM: One, two, three--

1428
01:29:05,502 --> 01:29:08,515
TRAVIS: And on the third one, I cast enlarge with
the Titanstone Knuckles,

1429
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,626
LIAM: And I sneak attack Ermergerd.

1430
01:29:10,626 --> 01:29:12,495
TRAVIS: And I smack Doty.

1431
01:29:12,577 --> 01:29:15,761
(all laugh)

1432
01:29:15,761 --> 01:29:17,135
SAM: Fuck, I'm dead.

1433
01:29:17,135 --> 01:29:20,261
LIAM: Pommel side, pommel side! I'm gonna Kynan
him.

1434
01:29:20,261 --> 01:29:21,680
MATT: Okay, and you're going after Doty.

1435
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,129
TRAVIS: Yup.

1436
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:23,192
MATT: With just your hands?

1437
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:24,300
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a backhand.

1438
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,020
MATT: Okay, both you guys roll attack.

1439
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,561
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

1440
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:31,618
TALIESIN: Boulder, Paper, Shears-- Boulder,
Parchment, Shears.

1441
01:29:31,618 --> 01:29:32,913
MARISHA: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.

1442
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,233
TRAVIS: 24.

1443
01:29:34,233 --> 01:29:36,595
LIAM: Natural 20!

1444
01:29:36,595 --> 01:29:39,364
LAURA: Why do you want a natural 20?! You're going
to kill him!

1445
01:29:39,364 --> 01:29:40,301
TALIESIN: No, no.

1446
01:29:40,301 --> 01:29:42,178
LIAM: Not with the pommel side, man!

1447
01:29:42,178 --> 01:29:43,815
MATT: Okay, go ahead and do your sneak attack
damage.

1448
01:29:43,815 --> 01:29:45,090
MARISHA: Non-lethal.

1449
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,051
LIAM: Thank you.

1450
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:48,694
MATT: And double it cause you rolled a natural 20.

1451
01:29:48,694 --> 01:29:50,846
You, go ahead and roll for the backhand, it's one--

1452
01:29:50,846 --> 01:29:51,853
SAM: I will be dead.

1453
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:52,986
TRAVIS: It's four, right?

1454
01:29:52,986 --> 01:29:56,971
MATT: It's just a backhand. I would say it's one
damage plus your strength modifier.

1455
01:29:57,062 --> 01:30:00,259
TALIESIN: "Vax, where'd you get that amazing 
armor?"

1456
01:30:00,259 --> 01:30:01,722
TRAVIS: Eight, so nine?

1457
01:30:01,722 --> 01:30:03,927
MATT: Okay, so nine damage.

1458
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:05,443
TRAVIS: My strength modifier is eight.

1459
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:12,013
MATT: Yeah, so it'd be nine.

1460
01:30:12,013 --> 01:30:17,399
SAM: Doty is going to use his reaction to attack
Vax.

1461
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,186
MATT: Okay, yes.

1462
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:23,379
SAM: Right? Because when attacked within five
feet of me, he gets to react?

1463
01:30:23,379 --> 01:30:24,168
MATT: Yep.

1464
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:25,351
TALIESIN: What?!

1465
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:26,583
SAM: To defend me? Or to attack?

1466
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,074
MATT: To attack the person who attacked you.

1467
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:29,594
TRAVIS: See, this is a real good way to figure
shit out.

1468
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:30,482
TALIESIN: I'm already excited by this.

1469
01:30:30,482 --> 01:30:32,066
LAURA: This is true! This is smart.

1470
01:30:32,066 --> 01:30:33,054
TRAVIS: Thanks.

1471
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:35,328
LAURA: You're so smart!

1472
01:30:35,328 --> 01:30:38,234
MATT: After this round, actually, for the tension
basis of this and for the arrangement for the

1473
01:30:38,234 --> 01:30:41,505
circumstance, I'm going to take a break,
and then come back to this, so we can give this

1474
01:30:41,505 --> 01:30:47,835
the real feel you want to. So after this round.
All right, so after--

1475
01:30:47,897 --> 01:30:50,750
Okay, so you do seven damage,
you backhand Doty (impact sound)--

1476
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,473
TRAVIS: Nine! Nine damage, yeah.

1477
01:30:52,473 --> 01:30:56,754
MATT: -- and the head turns to the side.
The tome falls to the ground, open on the ground

1478
01:30:56,807 --> 01:31:01,505
so the pages fold a little bit, and the metallic
creature (shifting metal) back to

1479
01:31:01,505 --> 01:31:06,929
you, stands up, and now goes a full six inches
taller than you, and then rears back with its

1480
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:10,687
fist, and right as it's about to swing, it sees
from behind

1481
01:31:10,687 --> 01:31:14,523
Vax creep up and hit-- how much damage?

1482
01:31:14,523 --> 01:31:15,411
LIAM: 86.

1483
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:17,115
MATT: 86 points of damage.

1484
01:31:17,115 --> 01:31:17,754
SAM: 86 to me?

1485
01:31:17,754 --> 01:31:18,626
TALIESIN: What?!

1486
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:19,278
LIAM: Yes.

1487
01:31:19,278 --> 01:31:20,479
SAM: Great. Great.

1488
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:24,400
TRAVIS: Plus I'm enlarged, so I am probably taller
than Doty now.

1489
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,629
MATT: Actually, that's right, yeah, so even at
your enlarged height, you're still probably a good

1490
01:31:27,629 --> 01:31:29,353
foot and a half, two feet larger than Doty.

1491
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:31,598
TRAVIS: Let's say I hit him, he looks back,
and he's looking at my nipples.

1492
01:31:31,598 --> 01:31:33,038
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

1493
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:35,700
MATT: Yeah, there you go. As you're growing
(robotic motion noises)--

1494
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:36,694
TRAVIS: What happened?

1495
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:41,029
MATT: Goes to punch towards you, however out of
the corner of Doty's eye, sees this half-elf show

1496
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:46,342
up and whack him right square in the center of the
neck and spinal column and then the fist just goes

1497
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:51,465
wide and slams toward you. That is going to be a
23 to hit.

1498
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:54,657
LIAM: Hits.

1499
01:31:54,678 --> 01:32:00,364
MATT: You suffer... Ooh! 16 points of bludgeoning
damage.

1500
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:01,577
LAURA: Ooh!

1501
01:32:01,577 --> 01:32:07,077
MATT: As the giant iron fist of Doty just (whack)
clangs into the back of your head and part of your

1502
01:32:07,077 --> 01:32:10,020
ear and you feel the ringing in your skull from
the impact.

1503
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,622
LIAM: Mm-hm.

1504
01:32:12,622 --> 01:32:14,122
MATT: You, Taryon, fall to your knees--

1505
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:15,050
SAM: (pained grunt)

1506
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:19,402
MATT: -- and find a large portion of your
vitality and breath and just general awareness

1507
01:32:19,485 --> 01:32:22,909
knocked out of you from from one singular blow
from nowhere. Your eyes go white for a second--

1508
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:26,675
SAM: This is the sound that I make. (high pitched
goat-like yelps)

1509
01:32:26,737 --> 01:32:35,934
(all laugh)

1510
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:37,594
TRAVIS: That's a wuss panic.

1511
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:42,816
SAM: Do I get a shot?

1512
01:32:42,816 --> 01:32:47,178
MATT: That was the surprise round, because you
were not aware of this circumstance. We're going

1513
01:32:47,178 --> 01:32:48,702
to continue combat after this break.

1514
01:32:48,702 --> 01:32:50,926
(cheers and laughter)

1515
01:32:50,926 --> 01:32:51,896
MARISHA: I'm getting in on this!

1516
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:53,095
LIAM: It was his idea!

1517
01:32:53,095 --> 01:32:56,467
MATT: Oh yeah. Just so you're aware, everyone
who's watching, you just watched your boyfriend

1518
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:59,034
cold-cock an innocent person.

1519
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:02,702
MARISHA: I watched him walk up behind him and do
it. I knew what he was doing.

1520
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:04,989
MATT: All right, just so you're aware. All right
guys--

1521
01:33:04,989 --> 01:33:09,743
MARISHA: This is a part of our Vox Machina hazing.
This is what we do!

1522
01:33:09,743 --> 01:33:11,726
MATT: This is pretty fucked up, you guys.

1523
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:13,101
(all laugh)

1524
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:13,848
TALIESIN: So fucked up!

1525
01:33:13,848 --> 01:33:15,846
MATT: All right, we'll come back in a few minutes
after we take a quick break to continue this

1526
01:33:15,846 --> 01:33:21,305
combat. We'll see you here shortly.

1527
01:33:21,305 --> 01:50:34,037
[BREAK]

1528
01:50:34,105 --> 01:50:39,215
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome back to Critical
Role. So, last we left off, in the middle of the

1529
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:45,128
Whitestone courtyard, two members of Vox Machina
decided, as part of the hazing process, to assault

1530
01:50:45,128 --> 01:50:46,967
our new temporary party member.

1531
01:50:46,967 --> 01:50:48,728
TALIESIN: (laughs) When you put it like that.

1532
01:50:48,728 --> 01:50:50,428
TRAVIS: How about test?

1533
01:50:50,428 --> 01:50:52,184
LIAM: This is literally the third time we have
done this.

1534
01:50:52,184 --> 01:50:55,882
MATT: I know! I'm not surprised by any of you.
It's just-- Oh no, I am surprised, I wasn't

1535
01:50:55,882 --> 01:50:57,993
expecting it, but it makes sense.

1536
01:50:57,993 --> 01:50:59,801
MARISHA: Wow, it sounds like us last week.

1537
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:00,702
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

1538
01:51:00,702 --> 01:51:01,224
LAURA: Hey!

1539
01:51:01,224 --> 01:51:02,371
TRAVIS: Or every week.

1540
01:51:02,371 --> 01:51:06,634
MATT: That being the case, anyone who cares to get
involved in this, I need you to roll initiative.

1541
01:51:06,634 --> 01:51:07,408
TALIESIN: In.

1542
01:51:07,408 --> 01:51:07,962
MARISHA: In.

1543
01:51:07,962 --> 01:51:09,053
LAURA: Am I there?

1544
01:51:09,053 --> 01:51:10,521
SAM: Wait, you guys are all doing this to me?

1545
01:51:10,521 --> 01:51:13,355
TALIESIN: No, I want to be in initiative just to
make sure that I can actually make sure that--

1546
01:51:13,355 --> 01:51:14,733
MARISHA: I want to make decisions.

1547
01:51:14,733 --> 01:51:16,428
MATT: Would you have gone with him,
or would you have stayed back?

1548
01:51:16,428 --> 01:51:19,418
LAURA: Well, I was coming from talking to Jarrett
so, it's up to you if I'm there yet.

1549
01:51:19,494 --> 01:51:20,966
MATT: So yeah, you wouldn't be there actually,
yeah.

1550
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:22,299
LAURA: Am I walking up as it's happening?

1551
01:51:22,299 --> 01:51:23,638
MATT: You will be walking up towards the castle.

1552
01:51:23,638 --> 01:51:24,372
LIAM: This was a--

1553
01:51:24,372 --> 01:51:25,400
TRAVIS: Yeah, this was a Tweedledee and
Tweedledum.

1554
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,257
LIAM: -- Grog whispering to Vax thing,
on a walk.

1555
01:51:28,257 --> 01:51:30,764
MATT: So. There is no Percival, no Keyleth in,
but you guys were--

1556
01:51:30,764 --> 01:51:31,703
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm in!

1557
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:32,389
MARISHA: No, I'm in.

1558
01:51:32,389 --> 01:51:33,406
MATT: Okay. Percival's in, yeah, they're there.

1559
01:51:33,406 --> 01:51:35,781
LIAM: Yeah, we're not trying try to ditch them.
I'm just saying. It wasn't an announced thing.

1560
01:51:35,781 --> 01:51:42,075
MATT: Yeah, so Vex is the only one who's not 
there. Okay, so, for those who are present and

1561
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:46,495
wish to be part of this: roll initiative. 
What have we got? So we have...

1562
01:51:46,495 --> 01:51:47,675
SAM: Eight.

1563
01:51:47,675 --> 01:51:48,628
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1564
01:51:48,628 --> 01:51:51,777
SAM: (choking noise)

1565
01:51:51,777 --> 01:51:53,121
TALIESIN: 25.

1566
01:51:53,121 --> 01:51:56,353
SAM: You shouldn't bother. It's over!

1567
01:51:56,353 --> 01:51:57,314
MARISHA: 16.

1568
01:51:57,314 --> 01:52:01,951
LIAM: (choking noise) Big 11.

1569
01:52:01,951 --> 01:52:07,951
TRAVIS: 18.

1570
01:52:07,951 --> 01:52:15,748
MATT: Okay, Percival, you're up first. As you watch
Grog backhand this mechanical entity in the face,

1571
01:52:15,815 --> 01:52:24,845
while Vax appears from the shadows and 
just beans the back of Taryon across the center of

1572
01:52:24,845 --> 01:52:26,027
the neck and spinal column--

1573
01:52:26,027 --> 01:52:27,227
SAM: (muffled scream)

1574
01:52:27,227 --> 01:52:29,645
MATT: -- and he falls to his knee making this
horrible, horrible sound.

1575
01:52:29,689 --> 01:52:32,420
LIAM: (laughs) That's my friend.

1576
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:38,205
TALIESIN: Come on man, pick it up, pick it up! I
just draw my sword and stand on the sidelines,

1577
01:52:38,205 --> 01:52:40,167
preparing for whatever is about to happen.

1578
01:52:40,167 --> 01:52:42,156
SAM: (gasping for breath)

1579
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:44,103
MATT: Okay. Grog.

1580
01:52:44,103 --> 01:52:47,044
TRAVIS: Did Doty go down or-- no, he just stood
there looking at me afterwards, right?

1581
01:52:47,044 --> 01:52:49,463
MATT: Yeah. Doty just (twang), and looked back at
you slowly.

1582
01:52:49,463 --> 01:52:51,760
TRAVIS: Right. Where is--

1583
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,105
MATT: Unblinking mechanical face.

1584
01:52:53,105 --> 01:52:55,017
TRAVIS: Where is Tary Jumbo?

1585
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,466
MATT: Right here, about five feet from you.

1586
01:52:58,466 --> 01:52:59,356
TRAVIS: I look at him.

1587
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:00,528
SAM: (whimpers)

1588
01:53:00,528 --> 01:53:04,922
TRAVIS: I hold up my hand and say: Show me what
you have learned

1589
01:53:04,922 --> 01:53:10,846
(all laugh)

1590
01:53:10,846 --> 01:53:11,934
MATT: That's all you do?

1591
01:53:11,934 --> 01:53:12,693
TRAVIS: That's it.

1592
01:53:12,693 --> 01:53:15,055
MATT: Okay, that's Grog's turn. Keyleth.

1593
01:53:15,055 --> 01:53:24,334
MARISHA: Okay, first and foremost I'm going to
create a windwall, around us, like an arena.

1594
01:53:24,334 --> 01:53:24,947
MATT: Like an arena.

1595
01:53:24,947 --> 01:53:25,546
MARISHA: Yeah.

1596
01:53:25,546 --> 01:53:27,357
MATT: Okay.

1597
01:53:27,357 --> 01:53:29,108
MARISHA: (wind swirling) And then I'm
gonna--

1598
01:53:29,108 --> 01:53:32,340
MATT: Suddenly, the wind kicks up around (heavy 
wind). The leaves and various fallen parts

1599
01:53:32,417 --> 01:53:37,797
of the greenery around here kick up into this
torrent around you, as the wind is now creating a

1600
01:53:37,797 --> 01:53:40,631
barrier around the battlefield.

1601
01:53:40,631 --> 01:53:49,762
MARISHA: Yeah, I turn to Percy and I say: man,
you know, I almost feel bad for the guy.

1602
01:53:49,762 --> 01:53:50,710
SAM: (gasps loudly)

1603
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:51,556
TALIESIN: Give him a boost.

1604
01:53:51,556 --> 01:53:52,295
MARISHA: Should I give him a boost?

1605
01:53:52,295 --> 01:53:53,326
TALIESIN: Give him a boost.

1606
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:54,845
MARISHA: Should we give him an incentive?

1607
01:53:54,845 --> 01:53:56,036
TALIESIN: Nah.

1608
01:53:56,036 --> 01:53:59,128
MARISHA: All right, we'll start with a boost.
And I give him a healing word.

1609
01:53:59,128 --> 01:54:00,069
MATT: Okay, what level?

1610
01:54:00,069 --> 01:54:01,956
MARISHA: We'll give him a level two.

1611
01:54:01,956 --> 01:54:04,505
MATT: Level two, all right. 2d4 plus six.

1612
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:12,334
MARISHA: I guess you're worth it. Oh, you got real
lucky Tary. I got a four and a three,

1613
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:15,921
which adds to be seven. Plus...

1614
01:54:15,921 --> 01:54:17,721
MATT: Plus six for your Wisdom, so it's 13.

1615
01:54:17,721 --> 01:54:22,566
MARISHA: 13 points. And then I say: come on,
Tary!

1616
01:54:22,566 --> 01:54:27,434
SAM: (high-pitched) What? Who said that? Why is
the wind blowing?

1617
01:54:27,434 --> 01:54:28,793
MATT: Vax, what are you doing?

1618
01:54:28,793 --> 01:54:32,644
(all laugh)

1619
01:54:32,644 --> 01:54:35,803
LIAM: I bring my hand around the back of his head,
and I'm gonna use my action to cast Lay on Hands

1620
01:54:35,803 --> 01:54:42,094
and dump all 15 hit points into the back of his
head. Then I'm going to use Disengage and hop back

1621
01:54:42,094 --> 01:54:46,885
away from him and say-- Oh, no! Before I hop back
and say: we are a bunch of fucking assholes and

1622
01:54:46,885 --> 01:54:49,299
this is all you are going to get with us.
Are you sure?

1623
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:51,542
And then use Disengage to roll back.

1624
01:54:51,542 --> 01:54:52,947
MATT: All right. And you move back away from him?

1625
01:54:52,947 --> 01:54:56,045
LIAM: Yeah, but I have my movement plus-- Yes,
back.

1626
01:54:56,045 --> 01:54:56,710
MATT: How far?

1627
01:54:56,710 --> 01:54:57,387
LIAM: 30 feet.

1628
01:54:57,387 --> 01:55:00,807
MATT: 30 feet.

1629
01:55:00,807 --> 01:55:09,354
MATT: All righty. Yep, okay. That ends your turn.
Taryon. What do you wish to do?

1630
01:55:09,354 --> 01:55:10,300
TRAVIS: First time.

1631
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:17,168
SAM: Hands shaking, body quivering, blood
everywhere.

1632
01:55:17,233 --> 01:55:19,435
(all laugh)

1633
01:55:19,435 --> 01:55:20,520
LIAM: No, no, no--

1634
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,064
MATT: No, out of the nose.

1635
01:55:22,064 --> 01:55:23,568
LIAM: You have a massive headache.

1636
01:55:23,568 --> 01:55:27,646
MATT: You did 88 damage to him from
behind with the back of your dagger. There is

1637
01:55:27,646 --> 01:55:29,616
blood out of his nose, out of his ears.

1638
01:55:29,616 --> 01:55:32,994
LIAM: I just wanted to get him to unconscious.
If I'm not a master assassin--

1639
01:55:32,994 --> 01:55:33,910
LAURA: Nope.

1640
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:35,337
LIAM: How can I not go (thu-kunk) and not--

1641
01:55:35,337 --> 01:55:36,916
MARISHA: You at least split his head.

1642
01:55:36,916 --> 01:55:38,274
TRAVIS: He has weak capillaries.

1643
01:55:38,274 --> 01:55:42,730
MATT: Understand, you critically hit him from
behind to do 88 points of damage.

1644
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:43,524
LIAM: Right.

1645
01:55:43,524 --> 01:55:45,316
MATT: That would have killed a regular human
being.

1646
01:55:45,316 --> 01:55:46,217
LIAM: Right, right.

1647
01:55:46,217 --> 01:55:48,767
MATT: Or at least have put them in a-- He's not
like, bleeding out.

1648
01:55:48,767 --> 01:55:49,504
LIAM: Okay.

1649
01:55:49,504 --> 01:55:52,371
MATT: But he looks rough.

1650
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,563
(all laugh)

1651
01:55:53,654 --> 01:55:56,097
LIAM: Did I make it clear that I was trying to do
this to Sam and not Tary?

1652
01:55:56,097 --> 01:55:57,577
(all laugh)

1653
01:55:57,577 --> 01:55:59,287
MATT: No. Sam, what are you doing?

1654
01:55:59,287 --> 01:56:03,057
SAM: I-- I, shit, well Grog gets an attack,
but I'm going to--

1655
01:56:03,057 --> 01:56:05,651
MATT: Actually, Grog is not directly in a melee
with you, so Grog does not.

1656
01:56:05,651 --> 01:56:11,968
SAM: Oh, I'm going to counter clockwise around
Doty, all the way round.

1657
01:56:12,049 --> 01:56:13,389
MATT: All the way around to here?

1658
01:56:13,389 --> 01:56:18,481
SAM: Yeah, yeah. All the way round, yeah.
So I'm facing Grog and the others, in a sort of a

1659
01:56:18,481 --> 01:56:27,501
cone pattern. And I fumble, I'm fumbling on the
helmet, trying to find the right gem to pull out.

1660
01:56:27,501 --> 01:56:37,825
And I pull out a diamond. And I pluck it out of
the helmet and I go (screams).

1661
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:40,465
And I will cast Prismatic Spray.

1662
01:56:40,759 --> 01:56:41,669
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1663
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:43,907
LAURA: Oh shit!

1664
01:56:43,907 --> 01:56:50,455
MATT: So just past Doty, (whoosh), as a familiar,
and previously prevented, blast of rainbow arcane

1665
01:56:50,455 --> 01:56:57,866
energy comes shooting forth from Taryon's hand.
Hitting Grog, Keyleth and Percival.

1666
01:56:57,866 --> 01:56:59,730
TALIESIN: Yep.

1667
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:01,769
MATT: I need you all to make a dexterity saving
throw.

1668
01:57:01,769 --> 01:57:02,453
MARISHA: Yeah.

1669
01:57:02,453 --> 01:57:03,720
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1670
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:06,875
TALIESIN: I get advantage on that.

1671
01:57:06,875 --> 01:57:08,636
MATT: You do, because of your cloak.

1672
01:57:08,636 --> 01:57:11,332
TALIESIN: It's a-- What saving throw? I'm so
sorry.

1673
01:57:11,332 --> 01:57:13,039
MATT: What's the DC on that?

1674
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:14,493
SAM: Oh! On me?

1675
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:16,311
MATT: Yes, on the helmet.

1676
01:57:16,311 --> 01:57:17,535
SAM: The helm is 18.

1677
01:57:17,535 --> 01:57:21,845
MATT: Okay.

1678
01:57:21,845 --> 01:57:22,873
TRAVIS: 13.

1679
01:57:22,873 --> 01:57:24,148
MARISHA: 23.

1680
01:57:24,148 --> 01:57:27,622
SAM: Wow.

1681
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:28,635
TALIESIN: 20.

1682
01:57:28,635 --> 01:57:29,837
SAM: Wow, guys.

1683
01:57:29,837 --> 01:57:33,763
MATT: Okay, so. Both of you guys halve the damage.
Grog does not.

1684
01:57:33,763 --> 01:57:35,441
TRAVIS: Gimme what you got.

1685
01:57:35,441 --> 01:57:37,261
LIAM &amp; MARISHA: Show me what you got!

1686
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:39,330
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my reaction to swallow
part of the spell, so I'm going to take half

1687
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,902
damage of his half damage.

1688
01:57:40,902 --> 01:57:43,515
MATT: Okay, got you. I'm going to go ahead and do
this.

1689
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:45,069
MARISHA: Can you do the chargey thing?

1690
01:57:45,069 --> 01:57:46,383
TALIESIN: Mm-hm. But I'm fully charged.

1691
01:57:46,383 --> 01:57:50,076
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool. That's cool.

1692
01:57:50,076 --> 01:57:52,289
TALIESIN: I can use this as long as I have a
reaction.

1693
01:57:52,289 --> 01:57:53,309
MARISHA: Right.

1694
01:57:53,309 --> 01:57:55,969
SAM: Do I roll? Do you roll?

1695
01:57:55,969 --> 01:58:01,560
MATT: Actually, you get to roll. If you want to.
So it's 10d6 damage.

1696
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,322
SAM: Maybe you should roll.

1697
01:58:03,322 --> 01:58:04,654
MATT: Okay, I did roll for that one.

1698
01:58:04,654 --> 01:58:05,531
SAM: Oh, okay.

1699
01:58:05,531 --> 01:58:06,535
MATT: Just in case, so--

1700
01:58:06,535 --> 01:58:08,098
SAM: 10d6 what damage?

1701
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:09,967
MATT: I'm gonna figure that out here in just a
minute.

1702
01:58:09,967 --> 01:58:10,699
SAM: Okay.

1703
01:58:10,699 --> 01:58:11,412
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

1704
01:58:11,412 --> 01:58:13,544
MATT: 41 damage, however, against you, Percy.

1705
01:58:13,544 --> 01:58:16,564
MARISHA: If you've vaporized me, I'm going to be
real pissed.

1706
01:58:16,564 --> 01:58:21,235
MATT: That is 41 points of poison damage to you.

1707
01:58:21,235 --> 01:58:21,925
TALIESIN: Halved.

1708
01:58:21,925 --> 01:58:24,062
MATT: Reduced to 20, reduced to ten.

1709
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:25,069
TALIESIN: To ten.

1710
01:58:25,069 --> 01:58:28,567
MATT: And your charges are still full,
regardless.

1711
01:58:28,567 --> 01:58:29,955
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1712
01:58:29,955 --> 01:58:31,046
MATT: Keyleth.

1713
01:58:31,046 --> 01:58:32,286
MARISHA: Yeah.

1714
01:58:32,286 --> 01:58:37,292
MATT: You take 41 points of fire damage,
halved to 20. So, 20 points of fire damage as the

1715
01:58:37,292 --> 01:58:43,432
red beam hits you and the flames just burn across.
The front of your hair blown back from the blast

1716
01:58:43,432 --> 01:58:48,691
of the heat. Percival, you feel the sickly ray of
the poison splatter past and cover your skin with

1717
01:58:48,691 --> 01:58:57,591
this semi-translucent poisonous liquid. Grog,
you take 41 points of cold damage.

1718
01:58:57,591 --> 01:59:00,925
TRAVIS: I have resistance, with my new exalted
knuckles.

1719
01:59:00,996 --> 01:59:03,247
MATT: You do. So, you take 20 points of cold
damage from that.

1720
01:59:03,247 --> 01:59:05,593
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1721
01:59:05,593 --> 01:59:08,829
MATT: So, the beam subsides and you see them all
blasted with it, but they're still standing.

1722
01:59:08,829 --> 01:59:10,298
SAM: (gasps)

1723
01:59:10,298 --> 01:59:11,145
MATT: Perturbed by it.

1724
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:13,852
SAM: How are they still alive?

1725
01:59:13,918 --> 01:59:15,451
(all laugh)

1726
01:59:15,451 --> 01:59:17,821
MATT: And Doty's at the ready, (metal
hitting metal) What do you want Doty to do?

1727
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:19,386
MARISHA: New kid's got game.

1728
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:23,073
SAM: Well, first of all, as my bonus action,
I will cast Sanctuary on myself.

1729
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,169
MARISHA: What the fuck is that?

1730
01:59:25,169 --> 01:59:26,132
TRAVIS: What is that?

1731
01:59:26,132 --> 01:59:27,669
SAM: It protects me from things.

1732
01:59:27,669 --> 01:59:29,470
(all laugh)

1733
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,511
SAM: Like a lot.

1734
01:59:30,511 --> 01:59:31,765
TRAVIS: We'll see.

1735
01:59:31,765 --> 01:59:38,803
MATT: (laughing) Yeah, I love it.

1736
01:59:38,803 --> 01:59:40,509
TRAVIS: That's a new one right? We haven't come up
against that before.

1737
01:59:40,509 --> 01:59:42,043
SAM: They're all new, friend.

1738
01:59:42,043 --> 01:59:44,423
MATT: All right, so Sanctuary on you, and what do
you want to tell Doty to do?

1739
01:59:44,423 --> 01:59:53,261
SAM: Doty, I will say, (gasping for breath) Doty,
save me... Save me! Hit the big guy!

1740
01:59:53,261 --> 02:00:00,825
MATT: (metal grinding and a heavy force
swinging) And is going to go in for ...

1741
02:00:00,825 --> 02:00:06,760
The giant fist hit towards you.
That is going to be a 17 to hit. What's your AC?

1742
02:00:06,893 --> 02:00:08,220
TRAVIS: That is my AC.

1743
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:13,024
MATT: All right, that hits. And then, after the
fist comes back and smacks you in the face,

1744
02:00:13,024 --> 02:00:16,805
across the jaw, for nine plus five-- 14 points of
bludgeoning damage.

1745
02:00:16,805 --> 02:00:17,986
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

1746
02:00:17,986 --> 02:00:23,491
MATT: The hand grabs the front your clavicle,
pulls back, and attempts to headbutt you.

1747
02:00:23,491 --> 02:00:24,866
That's a natural 20.

1748
02:00:24,866 --> 02:00:25,490
LIAM: Ooh.

1749
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:26,207
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1750
02:00:26,207 --> 02:00:28,339
TRAVIS: Nice. I love it.

1751
02:00:28,339 --> 02:00:29,478
MARISHA: Yeah? Yeah.

1752
02:00:29,478 --> 02:00:32,513
MATT: That is 14-- That is 19 points of
bludgeoning damage.

1753
02:00:32,529 --> 02:00:34,061
So, halved to nine.

1754
02:00:34,061 --> 02:00:34,898
LIAM: That's terrible.

1755
02:00:34,898 --> 02:00:35,916
TRAVIS: I'm not raging.

1756
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:36,872
MATT: That's right! So--

1757
02:00:36,872 --> 02:00:38,111
TRAVIS: 19 points of bludgeoning damage.

1758
02:00:38,111 --> 02:00:40,872
MATT: Yeah, so 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
As Doty just

1759
02:00:40,872 --> 02:00:44,228
(clang) slams you right in the middle of the face.

1760
02:00:44,228 --> 02:00:46,924
You feel the nose kinda (cracking noise) from the
break, and the blood getting gushed from your

1761
02:00:46,924 --> 02:00:49,089
nostrils. From the headbutt.

1762
02:00:49,089 --> 02:00:49,977
TRAVIS: Nice.

1763
02:00:49,977 --> 02:00:54,072
MATT: All right, that ends Doty's turn.
Sanctuary's on you.

1764
02:00:54,072 --> 02:00:55,934
Next up, top of the round, Percival.

1765
02:00:55,934 --> 02:01:00,073
TALIESIN: Mm.

1766
02:01:00,073 --> 02:01:01,682
MARISHA: Yeah, that Prismatic Spray was
impressive.

1767
02:01:01,682 --> 02:01:02,960
TALIESIN: That was very impressive, yes.

1768
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,511
MARISHA: What are you gonna do?

1769
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:07,717
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think I'm just gonna
enjoy watching this for a minute.

1770
02:01:07,717 --> 02:01:08,929
MARISHA: Yeah.

1771
02:01:08,929 --> 02:01:16,357
TALIESIN: I'm gonna hold my attack. Until he pulls
out another object. Of any kind.

1772
02:01:16,357 --> 02:01:18,564
MATT: Okay, so you're holding until he fiddles
with an object.

1773
02:01:18,564 --> 02:01:19,153
TALIESIN: Yep.

1774
02:01:19,153 --> 02:01:21,897
MATT: Okay. That brings it to Grog.

1775
02:01:21,897 --> 02:01:28,765
TRAVIS: Right. That was a pretty good hit,
and now I'm angry. And I rage.

1776
02:01:28,765 --> 02:01:29,531
MATT: Okay.

1777
02:01:29,531 --> 02:01:30,363
SAM: I'm dead.

1778
02:01:30,363 --> 02:01:32,760
MATT: Bonus action, rage.

1779
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:39,378
TRAVIS: And I walk up so I am within melee--
Actually, I'll go opposite... yeah, on the other

1780
02:01:39,378 --> 02:01:41,702
side of Tary from Doty.

1781
02:01:41,702 --> 02:01:44,571
MATT: Okay.

1782
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:46,670
SAM: I don't attack of opportunity, do I?

1783
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:47,946
TRAVIS: No, no, I wanna be on Tary, opposite of--

1784
02:01:47,946 --> 02:01:49,297
MATT: You weren't in combat with him.

1785
02:01:49,297 --> 02:01:49,977
SAM: Got it.

1786
02:01:49,977 --> 02:01:53,736
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I wanna be-- I wanna put Tary
between me and the big robot.

1787
02:01:53,736 --> 02:01:55,752
MATT: Oh I see. So you go this way.

1788
02:01:55,752 --> 02:01:56,675
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1789
02:01:56,675 --> 02:02:03,465
MATT: Okay. Great. I will say Doty does get an
attack of opportunity on you.

1790
02:02:03,465 --> 02:02:04,264
TRAVIS: Yep.

1791
02:02:04,264 --> 02:02:07,110
MATT: As you pull out of the way. That is a nine.
That does not hit you.

1792
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:08,014
TRAVIS: Nope.

1793
02:02:08,014 --> 02:02:11,395
MATT: (whoosh) Just too slow, and too wide as the
rage kinda instills you with adrenaline,

1794
02:02:11,395 --> 02:02:12,824
and you dodge past.

1795
02:02:12,824 --> 02:02:15,131
SAM: Dammit, Doty, do better!

1796
02:02:15,131 --> 02:02:16,254
MATT: All right.

1797
02:02:16,254 --> 02:02:22,974
TRAVIS: And as I look down, dribbling out of my
mouth, I say, Is that it? And that's my turn.

1798
02:02:22,974 --> 02:02:24,040
LAURA: Oh, God.

1799
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:25,367
SAM: What? You're not gonna kill me?

1800
02:02:25,367 --> 02:02:26,516
MATT: That's your turn?

1801
02:02:26,516 --> 02:02:27,269
TRAVIS: Yep.

1802
02:02:27,269 --> 02:02:29,215
MATT: Okay. Keyleth.

1803
02:02:29,215 --> 02:02:37,159
MARISHA: (sighs) Should I make this more
interesting? What haven't we tested yet? We

1804
02:02:37,159 --> 02:02:39,423
haven't really seen him dodge yet, right?

1805
02:02:39,423 --> 02:02:40,634
TALIESIN: I think we should see him dodge.

1806
02:02:40,634 --> 02:02:44,138
MARISHA: See how well he can dodge. And I throw a
Fireball. (explosion)

1807
02:02:44,212 --> 02:02:45,355
LAURA: (gasps)

1808
02:02:45,355 --> 02:02:46,568
MARISHA: Right next to Tary.

1809
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:47,638
MATT: Next to Tary? Okay.

1810
02:02:47,638 --> 02:02:50,818
MARISHA: I don't wanna mess up Grog. Just Tary and
Doty.

1811
02:02:50,818 --> 02:02:53,290
MATT: Okay, make a wisdom saving throw.

1812
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:53,863
LIAM: Whoa.

1813
02:02:53,863 --> 02:02:55,516
MARISHA: Make a wisdom saving throw?

1814
02:02:55,516 --> 02:02:56,209
TRAVIS: (gasps)

1815
02:02:56,209 --> 02:02:56,848
MATT: Yes.

1816
02:02:56,848 --> 02:02:57,709
MARISHA: Why? Because...

1817
02:02:57,709 --> 02:02:58,605
TRAVIS: Because he asked you to.

1818
02:02:58,605 --> 02:02:59,597
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1819
02:02:59,597 --> 02:03:00,316
LIAM: You find out afterwards.

1820
02:03:00,316 --> 02:03:02,179
MARISHA: The fuck did you do?

1821
02:03:02,179 --> 02:03:03,277
SAM: I got tricks.

1822
02:03:03,277 --> 02:03:04,151
TRAVIS: Sanctuary.

1823
02:03:04,151 --> 02:03:09,192
MARISHA: I got-- oh, Sanctuary. Against spells?
Even though this is an AOE?

1824
02:03:09,192 --> 02:03:11,735
TRAVIS: What's an AOE?

1825
02:03:11,735 --> 02:03:14,593
MATT: Any attack or spell that targets the warded
creature with an attack, so yes.

1826
02:03:14,593 --> 02:03:22,050
MARISHA: Any attack or spell. All right.
So, let's roll this one. Not great. That's not

1827
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:25,889
great, but luckily I got really high wisdom.
So, 18.

1828
02:03:25,889 --> 02:03:27,481
MATT: What's your spell DC, Tary?

1829
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:31,804
SAM: My spell DC? Is 17.

1830
02:03:31,804 --> 02:03:34,979
MATT: Okay, so yeah. Go ahead and roll your
Fireball damage. Tary, I'm gonna need you to make

1831
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:37,037
a dexterity saving throw.

1832
02:03:37,037 --> 02:03:38,079
LIAM: Oh my God.

1833
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:40,699
MARISHA: Ow, jeez, oh my God. There's like-- There
was like a little twinge.

1834
02:03:40,699 --> 02:03:42,789
TALIESIN: You should have Vax work that out,
later.

1835
02:03:42,789 --> 02:03:44,590
MARISHA: I think I was-- No, it's this guy.

1836
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,797
SAM: What do I do?

1837
02:03:45,797 --> 02:03:46,959
MATT: Dexterity saving throw, please.

1838
02:03:46,959 --> 02:03:48,220
SAM: Oh, that's not gonna go well.

1839
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:49,487
TALIESIN: No, you should get someone to work on
that.

1840
02:03:49,487 --> 02:03:50,333
MARISHA: I think it's Tary.

1841
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,065
SAM: Yeah, that's an 11.

1842
02:03:52,065 --> 02:03:55,365
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll damage if you don't
mind, Keyleth.

1843
02:03:55,365 --> 02:03:56,814
LIAM: Oh my God, he is hanging on by a thread.

1844
02:03:56,814 --> 02:03:57,766
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

1845
02:03:57,766 --> 02:03:59,286
MARISHA: Wait, where's my-- Who stole my book?

1846
02:03:59,286 --> 02:04:00,034
SAM: I have your book.

1847
02:04:00,034 --> 02:04:00,730
MARISHA: Fireball!

1848
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:02,420
SAM: But I need it more than you, you get
nothing!

1849
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:04,231
MARISHA: I need to know what Fireball does.

1850
02:04:04,231 --> 02:04:05,868
MATT: (laughs) 8d6 points of damage.

1851
02:04:05,868 --> 02:04:06,438
MARISHA: What is it?

1852
02:04:06,438 --> 02:04:08,100
MATT: 8d6 points of fire damage.

1853
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:08,653
SAM: Oh my God.

1854
02:04:08,653 --> 02:04:09,451
MARISHA: 8d6?

1855
02:04:09,451 --> 02:04:09,964
MATT: Yes.

1856
02:04:09,964 --> 02:04:11,068
MARISHA: I got it. One-- one, two...

1857
02:04:11,068 --> 02:04:12,851
LAURA: Where am I on my walk up? Can I hear this
going on?

1858
02:04:12,851 --> 02:04:13,712
MARISHA: Seven.

1859
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:17,198
MATT: You hear the distant-- As you're walking up
towards the front of the castle, you see,

1860
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:20,189
suddenly, this blast of multicolored arcane
energy just,

1861
02:04:20,189 --> 02:04:22,695
(shhhh) out from over the castle wall.

1862
02:04:22,695 --> 02:04:23,873
LAURA: Take off running.

1863
02:04:23,873 --> 02:04:26,291
MATT: You start running. Through the castle?

1864
02:04:26,291 --> 02:04:28,520
LAURA: As fast as I can get there-- The way I know
to get there the--

1865
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:29,466
MATT: Okay.

1866
02:04:29,466 --> 02:04:31,851
LAURA: Would it be faster to go up-- Broom up and
over? Into the courtyard.

1867
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:32,796
MATT: Probably, otherwise you'd--

1868
02:04:32,796 --> 02:04:33,790
LAURA: Let's do that.

1869
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:38,089
MATT: Okay so you immediately take the broom,
slam it under, and begin flying at dash speed.

1870
02:04:38,089 --> 02:04:40,090
It'll still take you a couple rounds to get
there.

1871
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:41,211
LAURA: Okay.

1872
02:04:41,211 --> 02:04:45,124
MATT: And as you begin to crest up you see a fiery
explosion in the middle of the courtyard, now.

1873
02:04:45,124 --> 02:04:48,214
LAURA: I make sure I take off my hat.

1874
02:04:48,214 --> 02:04:49,169
MATT: Okay.

1875
02:04:49,169 --> 02:04:52,701
MARISHA: 34 damage. So he did not dodge, though,
right?

1876
02:04:52,701 --> 02:04:55,518
MATT: No, so it's 34 points of fire damage.

1877
02:04:55,518 --> 02:04:56,626
SAM: Yeah.

1878
02:04:56,626 --> 02:04:57,747
MATT: Okay.

1879
02:04:57,747 --> 02:04:58,829
TALIESIN: You're still ...

1880
02:04:58,829 --> 02:04:59,651
MATT: Vax!

1881
02:04:59,651 --> 02:05:00,369
SAM: Alive?

1882
02:05:00,369 --> 02:05:01,177
TALIESIN: You're still alive.

1883
02:05:01,177 --> 02:05:02,499
MATT: It is your turn.

1884
02:05:02,499 --> 02:05:09,762
LIAM: I take both daggers and I shove them in my
belt, and I start circling down-- I'm looking at

1885
02:05:09,762 --> 02:05:13,761
the map-- yeah, that way, and just start talking.
Tary. Tary.

1886
02:05:13,761 --> 02:05:15,003
SAM: Who's talking?!

1887
02:05:15,003 --> 02:05:23,427
LIAM: It's the elf boy. This is what we do,
this is what we're gonna be facing, all right?

1888
02:05:23,427 --> 02:05:27,820
Guys, we're fine, we're fine, that's enough.

1889
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:29,080
MARISHA: You sure?

1890
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:33,219
LIAM: Are you sure you want to play with us?
Because we're going somewhere very dangerous very

1891
02:05:33,219 --> 02:05:38,778
soon, and they did not play nicely with me.
We're about to go to hell

1892
02:05:38,778 --> 02:05:43,843
with someone who did not deal fairly with me.

1893
02:05:43,843 --> 02:05:45,837
TALIESIN: Several of us have already died.

1894
02:05:45,837 --> 02:05:49,076
MARISHA: I drop the wind wall.

1895
02:05:49,076 --> 02:05:54,848
MATT: And as you come up over the outside
perimeter wall of castle Whitestone, you watch as

1896
02:05:54,848 --> 02:05:59,030
the wind that is whipping around slowly subsides,
and there in the center of the courtyard,

1897
02:05:59,030 --> 02:06:04,231
you see the rest of your friends encircling
Taryon Darrington, who is currently on one knee

1898
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:07,787
almost, and looks a little worse for wear.

1899
02:06:07,787 --> 02:06:11,707
LIAM: You can come along, and buddy, let me tell
you something, if we get in the middle of the

1900
02:06:11,707 --> 02:06:18,950
shit, I will protect you, but it is going to be
rough. And they're not going to call off their

1901
02:06:18,950 --> 02:06:25,276
attack like we are. Are you sure you want to write
this book and come with us?

1902
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:27,510
LAURA: Can I cannonball Trinket into the middle of
it?

1903
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:30,396
MATT: Sure. In the middle of this conversation,
you watch,

1904
02:06:30,396 --> 02:06:32,913
out of the corner of your eye, Taryon--

1905
02:06:32,913 --> 02:06:35,802
LAURA: Not at Taryon, at my party.

1906
02:06:35,802 --> 02:06:39,502
MATT: I know, but he looks over, because they're
all facing him, and he looks up and sees you

1907
02:06:39,502 --> 02:06:49,151
arcing over the top of the wall, and suddenly
there's a flash of dark energy and a large bear,

1908
02:06:49,151 --> 02:06:55,998
an armored bear, rolls out and just breaks into
the center of everyone here

1909
02:06:55,998 --> 02:06:59,613
as Taryon's pulling back, and now roars.

1910
02:06:59,613 --> 02:07:02,418
SAM: (yells)

1911
02:07:02,418 --> 02:07:08,838
LAURA: What the fuck is happening? I step away for
five seconds and everybody's at war.

1912
02:07:08,838 --> 02:07:10,075
MARISHA: No, no, this isn't war.

1913
02:07:10,075 --> 02:07:11,115
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're playing.

1914
02:07:11,115 --> 02:07:14,229
MARISHA: This is great, we were just giving him a
little trial run.

1915
02:07:14,229 --> 02:07:15,992
Isn't that right, Tary? Isn't this great?

1916
02:07:15,992 --> 02:07:17,640
SAM: No, this is not good.

1917
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:18,681
MARISHA: He's fine.

1918
02:07:18,681 --> 02:07:20,260
LIAM: Are you changing your mind?

1919
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:27,272
SAM: I can't do this. I can't do any of this.
I'm sorry.

1920
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:28,627
LIAM: Oh, wow.

1921
02:07:28,627 --> 02:07:39,773
SAM: I'm not a real adventurer. That was a story I
told you. I know it was very convincing,

1922
02:07:39,773 --> 02:07:46,629
but I haven't been on any real adventures, ever,
and--

1923
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:49,438
MARISHA: We knew that as soon as you said you
wanted to rescue a damsel.

1924
02:07:49,438 --> 02:07:52,949
SAM: I know that you thought that I was an
adventurer.

1925
02:07:52,949 --> 02:07:54,567
MARISHA: We never-- no.

1926
02:07:54,567 --> 02:08:02,841
SAM: I know that you all look at me and you just
see the armor and the handsomeness--

1927
02:08:02,841 --> 02:08:03,863
TALIESIN: The armor, yes.

1928
02:08:03,863 --> 02:08:05,343
SAM: --and the bravado.

1929
02:08:05,343 --> 02:08:06,357
TALIESIN: The armor.

1930
02:08:06,357 --> 02:08:08,949
SAM: And you think, he has it all.

1931
02:08:08,949 --> 02:08:10,227
TALIESIN: It's very nice armor.

1932
02:08:10,227 --> 02:08:18,526
SAM: He has everything that we want. But it's a
lie. It's a ruse.

1933
02:08:18,526 --> 02:08:19,485
LAURA: Can I land?

1934
02:08:19,485 --> 02:08:22,006
(all laugh)

1935
02:08:22,006 --> 02:08:26,959
MATT: And Trinket is still holding this aggressive
stance to the rest of you, just in the vicinity,

1936
02:08:26,959 --> 02:08:29,898
and looks a little more confused and just sits
down.

1937
02:08:29,898 --> 02:08:32,505
LAURA: Yeah, I think we're fine here, Trinket.

1938
02:08:32,505 --> 02:08:34,039
MARISHA: You notice we tend to make a lot of
people cry?

1939
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:35,328
LAURA: You made him cry?

1940
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,088
TALIESIN: We do.

1941
02:08:36,088 --> 02:08:36,941
MARISHA: We make a lot of people cry.

1942
02:08:36,941 --> 02:08:38,469
LAURA: What the fuck happened?

1943
02:08:38,469 --> 02:08:40,128
TALIESIN: We thought we would just give him a
little taste of

1944
02:08:40,128 --> 02:08:44,070
where he's going to make sure that
he was up to it.

1945
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:47,585
MARISHA: We told him we were gonna go see Hotis
and defeat him in the Nine Hells,

1946
02:08:47,585 --> 02:08:49,462
and we wanted to make sure he lived.

1947
02:08:49,462 --> 02:08:51,479
TALIESIN: We couldn't have this happen in the Nine
Hells.

1948
02:08:51,479 --> 02:08:52,635
MARISHA: Yeah, look at him.

1949
02:08:52,635 --> 02:08:53,824
TALIESIN: There's no crying in the Nine Hells.

1950
02:08:53,824 --> 02:08:55,604
LIAM: The worst place in all the multiverse,
and we're gonna

1951
02:08:55,604 --> 02:08:59,161
let him smack into that for his first time?

1952
02:08:59,161 --> 02:09:01,239
LAURA: Tary, you could die.

1953
02:09:01,239 --> 02:09:07,087
SAM: I... can I be real with you guys?

1954
02:09:07,087 --> 02:09:08,425
LAURA: Oh, we're ready.

1955
02:09:08,425 --> 02:09:12,692
TALIESIN: All right, all right.

1956
02:09:12,692 --> 02:09:19,783
SAM: (tearfully) My sister's gonna get everything.
All the money. The whole business. The compound,

1957
02:09:19,783 --> 02:09:29,276
the villas, everything. He's giving it to my
sister unless I prove myself. All right? I just

1958
02:09:29,276 --> 02:09:39,132
came out here to prove myself to my old man.
And I know that if I do, he will respect me

1959
02:09:39,132 --> 02:09:50,160
finally, and he will give me my money, and my
trust fund, and he will give me my villa,

1960
02:09:50,160 --> 02:10:01,131
and I will be the guy who takes over the
business. And I just-- I thought that I could.

1961
02:10:01,131 --> 02:10:05,136
But I can't. And I neeeed to.

1962
02:10:05,136 --> 02:10:09,913
(all laugh)

1963
02:10:09,913 --> 02:10:11,336
TALIESIN: Oh son, oh son.

1964
02:10:11,336 --> 02:10:13,202
LAURA: Oh, Tary.

1965
02:10:13,202 --> 02:10:14,496
LIAM: I walk over.

1966
02:10:14,496 --> 02:10:16,485
TALIESIN: Daddy issues, that's all we had to
hear.

1967
02:10:16,485 --> 02:10:20,210
SAM: I need to, I need to.

1968
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:24,674
LIAM: I kneel in front of him and I start
massaging where I fucking beaned him.

1969
02:10:24,674 --> 02:10:26,174
LAURA: Oh, careful there, it'll leave a bruise.

1970
02:10:26,174 --> 02:10:27,268
MATT: It stings a lot.

1971
02:10:27,268 --> 02:10:30,513
LIAM: No, no, I have very deft fingers.

1972
02:10:30,513 --> 02:10:33,868
MARISHA: Honestly, if you would've led with daddy
issues, we probably would've trusted you.

1973
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,603
TALIESIN: We would've just taken you right on.

1974
02:10:35,603 --> 02:10:37,802
LIAM: Because fathers can be assholes.

1975
02:10:37,802 --> 02:10:40,267
TALIESIN: They're so awful.

1976
02:10:40,267 --> 02:10:48,112
SAM: He doesn't like me, and he doesn't like the
books I read, and he doesn't like that I like

1977
02:10:48,112 --> 02:10:53,567
fantasy novels, and he doesn't like anything about
me.

1978
02:10:53,567 --> 02:10:56,334
TALIESIN: It's like looking into a dark mirror.
I don't know how I feel about this very dark

1979
02:10:56,334 --> 02:10:57,778
mirror right now.

1980
02:10:57,778 --> 02:11:01,686
LIAM: I take him into a gentle headlock and I turn
to my sister and say, Ahh, this guy.

1981
02:11:01,686 --> 02:11:02,773
LAURA: Ahh, this guy.

1982
02:11:02,773 --> 02:11:04,743
LIAM: Now I like this guy.

1983
02:11:04,743 --> 02:11:07,412
TRAVIS: I raise my hands above my head.

1984
02:11:07,412 --> 02:11:09,828
LIAM: Wait, what are you doing, what are you
doing?

1985
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:11,195
TRAVIS: Are we not finishing this?

1986
02:11:11,195 --> 02:11:13,384
TALIESIN: No.

1987
02:11:13,384 --> 02:11:16,298
MARISHA: No.

1988
02:11:16,298 --> 02:11:17,116
LIAM: No.

1989
02:11:17,116 --> 02:11:18,237
LAURA: Not so much.

1990
02:11:18,237 --> 02:11:20,453
MARISHA: We just learned that Tary's an ugly
crier.

1991
02:11:20,453 --> 02:11:23,325
We can't beat him over the head after that.

1992
02:11:23,325 --> 02:11:27,851
MATT: Trinket's head pokes just into frame to you,
Taryon, and he goes (licks)

1993
02:11:27,851 --> 02:11:29,012
SAM: (yelps)

1994
02:11:29,012 --> 02:11:31,463
LAURA: No no no. He's my pet.

1995
02:11:31,463 --> 02:11:40,062
LIAM: That was terrible tough love, and I'm very
sorry. I think you should come with us.

1996
02:11:40,062 --> 02:11:41,078
LAURA: What?

1997
02:11:41,078 --> 02:11:42,873
LIAM: I think you should.

1998
02:11:42,873 --> 02:11:49,051
SAM: I can be like an apprentice. Or an intern.
You guys are so powerful and I'm not.

1999
02:11:49,051 --> 02:11:55,271
LIAM: Do you know something? That fucking gaudy
hat you're wearing? I would have no idea how to

2000
02:11:55,271 --> 02:11:57,130
harness the power of that hat.

2001
02:11:57,130 --> 02:11:57,917
SAM: Really?

2002
02:11:57,917 --> 02:12:01,273
LIAM: I don't know shit about shit. All I know how
to do is hit people in the back of the head,

2003
02:12:01,273 --> 02:12:08,129
that's the one skill that I have. You know a lot
more than I do. All you lack is experience.

2004
02:12:08,129 --> 02:12:11,774
LAURA: Yeah, but I really am a little worried he's
gonna die in the Nine Hells.

2005
02:12:11,774 --> 02:12:15,504
LIAM: Well, I'm worried that we're all going to
die in the Nine Hells.

2006
02:12:15,504 --> 02:12:18,652
LAURA: Isn't there somewhere a little less scary
we can take him?

2007
02:12:18,652 --> 02:12:20,957
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's other stuff we need to do.

2008
02:12:20,957 --> 02:12:22,364
LIAM: Is there?

2009
02:12:22,364 --> 02:12:28,610
MARISHA: I guess we could go ahead and head to the
Water Ashari. It should be fairly calm.

2010
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:31,434
TRAVIS: Tary, have you ever passed out from
drinking too much?

2011
02:12:31,434 --> 02:12:32,331
SAM: No.

2012
02:12:32,331 --> 02:12:34,047
TRAVIS: Have you ever been unconscious?

2013
02:12:34,047 --> 02:12:36,436
SAM: Only when I go to sleep at night.

2014
02:12:36,436 --> 02:12:38,757
(all laugh)

2015
02:12:38,757 --> 02:12:41,179
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

2016
02:12:41,179 --> 02:12:44,194
LAURA: Oh no, I like him! Damn it.

2017
02:12:44,194 --> 02:12:49,586
LIAM: We had to beat him to a bloody pulp before
we liked him.

2018
02:12:49,586 --> 02:12:55,251
MARISHA: Look, we're all fuck-ups. We like people
who show their vulnerabilities.

2019
02:12:55,251 --> 02:12:56,863
SAM: No, I'm brave and strong.

2020
02:12:56,863 --> 02:12:58,681
TALIESIN: No, no.

2021
02:12:58,681 --> 02:13:00,734
LAURA: Nobody likes a dick. Well.

2022
02:13:00,734 --> 02:13:02,342
MARISHA: Or a douchenozzle.

2023
02:13:02,342 --> 02:13:03,309
LAURA: There it is.

2024
02:13:03,309 --> 02:13:04,908
TRAVIS: Now you're using it too many times.

2025
02:13:04,908 --> 02:13:06,776
MARISHA: Too much? Okay.

2026
02:13:06,776 --> 02:13:10,824
TALIESIN: Your cowering honesty has won us over.
Let's get you a beer. Would you like a beer?

2027
02:13:10,824 --> 02:13:12,355
SAM: No, I don't drink beer.

2028
02:13:12,355 --> 02:13:13,503
TALIESIN: Would you like a glass of wine?

2029
02:13:13,503 --> 02:13:14,157
SAM: Yes.

2030
02:13:14,157 --> 02:13:17,868
TALIESIN: We have wine. We have a lot of wine.
Some of it is quite good.

2031
02:13:17,868 --> 02:13:18,620
SAM: Really?

2032
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:19,236
TALIESIN: Really.

2033
02:13:19,236 --> 02:13:23,449
SAM: Because the stuff we had in Ank'harel was
really gross. I didn't wanna say anything, but--

2034
02:13:23,449 --> 02:13:24,966
TALIESIN: No, we know it was gross.

2035
02:13:24,966 --> 02:13:26,008
SAM: It was really gross.

2036
02:13:26,008 --> 02:13:26,866
TALIESIN: Yes.

2037
02:13:26,866 --> 02:13:28,426
SAM: It had no terroir.

2038
02:13:28,426 --> 02:13:31,534
TALIESIN: Sometimes we must sacrifice for the
adventure.

2039
02:13:31,534 --> 02:13:33,221
LAURA: Do you have any wine in your bag of
holding?

2040
02:13:33,221 --> 02:13:34,002
SAM: No!

2041
02:13:34,002 --> 02:13:34,990
TALIESIN: We have wine.

2042
02:13:34,990 --> 02:13:36,459
LAURA: I know, I just want to taste his wine.

2043
02:13:36,459 --> 02:13:37,514
TALIESIN: Well, that's fair.

2044
02:13:37,514 --> 02:13:38,522
SAM: I don't have any wine.

2045
02:13:38,522 --> 02:13:40,627
TRAVIS: Has Dotty been in any fights, or--

2046
02:13:40,627 --> 02:13:42,612
SAM: Doty.

2047
02:13:42,612 --> 02:13:45,578
MATT: Which, for the record, you now look over and
Doty has been writing all this down.

2048
02:13:45,578 --> 02:13:47,985
(all laugh)

2049
02:13:47,985 --> 02:13:49,983
TALIESIN: You are the worst person, I love you.

2050
02:13:49,983 --> 02:13:58,131
SAM: Doty, no! Why? Just pause for now.

2051
02:13:58,131 --> 02:14:03,066
LAURA: No, but seriously, was he your nanny? It's
okay if he was. I just want to know.

2052
02:14:03,066 --> 02:14:04,543
LIAM: I mean, honestly, we'd like--

2053
02:14:04,543 --> 02:14:06,070
LAURA: We'd like you more.

2054
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:09,139
LIAM: We like fuck-ups. We're a family of
fuck-ups, so, you want in or not?

2055
02:14:09,139 --> 02:14:10,780
LAURA: If you're honest.

2056
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:20,567
SAM: Doty is my best friend. My only friend.
Because he listens to me, and understands me,

2057
02:14:20,567 --> 02:14:33,127
and at night, when I play my characters,
he plays with me. I play combat, and I pretend to

2058
02:14:33,127 --> 02:14:38,313
be some of the characters I've read about,
and he pretends to be the others.

2059
02:14:38,313 --> 02:14:39,335
TRAVIS: I'm gonna kill him.

2060
02:14:39,335 --> 02:14:41,972
(all laugh)

2061
02:14:41,972 --> 02:14:45,009
LAURA: No, that's really wonderful. So you want to
be an actor.

2062
02:14:45,009 --> 02:14:53,432
SAM: No, I want to be a hero. And I just haven't
had the chance yet because my father says that I

2063
02:14:53,432 --> 02:15:00,864
should just be focused on taking over the family
business, learning financial things. And learning

2064
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:05,791
how to shake down a customer, and I'm so much more
than that.

2065
02:15:05,791 --> 02:15:11,589
MARISHA: There are other ways of being a hero than
being an adventurer. There are a lot of ways you

2066
02:15:11,589 --> 02:15:13,860
could be a hero.

2067
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:15,750
SAM: Tell me one.

2068
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,940
LAURA: You could be a philanthropist.

2069
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:23,723
MARISHA: Yeah. People who spend a lot of their
earnings and people who are more privileged,

2070
02:15:23,723 --> 02:15:26,512
like you, who help people in less privileged
places.

2071
02:15:26,512 --> 02:15:28,086
LIAM: There are many ways to help people in need.

2072
02:15:28,086 --> 02:15:30,047
SAM: Do they write books about philanthropists?

2073
02:15:30,047 --> 02:15:31,355
LAURA: A lot of times they do.

2074
02:15:31,355 --> 02:15:36,609
MARISHA: Yeah. People generally like them.

2075
02:15:36,609 --> 02:15:41,329
SAM: But the stories I've read of adventure and
derring-do and bravery--

2076
02:15:41,329 --> 02:15:42,164
TRAVIS: Much cooler.

2077
02:15:42,164 --> 02:15:43,787
SAM: Much cooler!

2078
02:15:43,787 --> 02:15:44,775
TRAVIS: Less boring.

2079
02:15:44,775 --> 02:15:46,015
SAM: Jumbo gets it.

2080
02:15:46,015 --> 02:15:49,710
TRAVIS: I promise you, none of their dads leave
the adventurers' money to their daughters,

2081
02:15:49,765 --> 02:15:51,914
it's always to the sons.

2082
02:15:51,914 --> 02:15:57,278
LIAM: But first I'd like to suggest a mantra.
I don't know if you've ever tried it. It helps

2083
02:15:57,278 --> 02:16:01,251
for me, it has in the past. Fuck your dad.
That's one--

2084
02:16:01,251 --> 02:16:02,859
LAURA and TALIESIN: Well.

2085
02:16:02,859 --> 02:16:05,666
LIAM: You know what I mean, you fucking
third-grade assholes, jeepers creepers.

2086
02:16:05,666 --> 02:16:08,050
SAM: He could have me or any of you killed.

2087
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:13,625
LIAM: We'll see. The other thing is, you've done
the impossible.

2088
02:16:13,625 --> 02:16:15,775
SAM: Which is?

2089
02:16:15,775 --> 02:16:21,515
LIAM: Well, I've taken a shine to you for some
reason. Do you wanna shake off the child's play

2090
02:16:21,515 --> 02:16:24,523
and do the real thing?

2091
02:16:24,523 --> 02:16:25,322
SAM: Very much.

2092
02:16:25,322 --> 02:16:32,289
LIAM: The truth is, you never stop being afraid.
Being brave doesn't mean you stop being afraid,

2093
02:16:32,289 --> 02:16:37,348
it means you learn to compartmentalize it.
You just live with it. So that feeling you're

2094
02:16:37,348 --> 02:16:40,685
feeling? You're not gonna lose that.

2095
02:16:40,685 --> 02:16:44,436
SAM: Okay. But how will I survive in battle?

2096
02:16:44,436 --> 02:16:45,257
LIAM: Well...

2097
02:16:45,257 --> 02:16:48,816
TRAVIS: Healing potions, people who look out for
each other.

2098
02:16:48,816 --> 02:16:50,118
TALIESIN: Friends. Friends.

2099
02:16:50,118 --> 02:16:51,721
LAURA: Hide behind your giant robot.

2100
02:16:51,721 --> 02:16:55,842
LIAM: This guys absorbs damage, so stick by him.

2101
02:16:55,842 --> 02:17:00,316
LAURA: Stay clear if what you do is cast spells.
Don't get up in the fray.

2102
02:17:00,316 --> 02:17:09,761
MARISHA: I can cast spells, and so can Vex, here.
It's through my antlers, so respect the antlers.

2103
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:14,549
SAM: Oh, I do. I do. They look very powerful.

2104
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:16,618
MARISHA: Respect.

2105
02:17:16,618 --> 02:17:20,449
SAM: Something about your eyes make me feel
ashamed.

2106
02:17:20,449 --> 02:17:22,298
LAURA: (laughs)

2107
02:17:22,298 --> 02:17:25,102
LIAM: Wow.

2108
02:17:25,102 --> 02:17:27,899
SAM: I'm sorry.

2109
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:30,381
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. That is a new one.

2110
02:17:30,381 --> 02:17:32,337
LAURA: Let's go get a drink.

2111
02:17:32,337 --> 02:17:35,372
LIAM: Can we get this guy drunk, please.

2112
02:17:35,372 --> 02:17:38,449
TALIESIN: We're getting into shame and we're
sober, I think something must be done about this.

2113
02:17:38,449 --> 02:17:43,894
TRAVIS: We got him so close to the brink,
right? Shouldn't we just introduce him to the

2114
02:17:43,894 --> 02:17:47,148
deep end so he can say he's been there, and then
we bring him up?

2115
02:17:47,148 --> 02:17:49,453
LAURA: What, like knock him unconscious?

2116
02:17:49,453 --> 02:17:51,091
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2117
02:17:51,091 --> 02:17:52,367
SAM: Please don't.

2118
02:17:52,367 --> 02:17:54,387
TRAVIS: No, no, really, there's something to be
said for it.

2119
02:17:54,387 --> 02:17:56,159
TALIESIN: Why don't we do it with wine?

2120
02:17:56,159 --> 02:17:57,901
LIAM: Yeah, yes, Percy's right.

2121
02:17:57,901 --> 02:18:02,358
MARISHA: We could do a little roleplay exercise,
like in your stories.

2122
02:18:02,358 --> 02:18:04,199
TALIESIN: We have a magnificent library.

2123
02:18:04,199 --> 02:18:05,274
SAM: You do?

2124
02:18:05,274 --> 02:18:06,218
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

2125
02:18:06,218 --> 02:18:07,047
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

2126
02:18:07,047 --> 02:18:09,754
MARISHA: Full disclosure.

2127
02:18:09,754 --> 02:18:12,844
TALIESIN: It's time we had another nerd.

2128
02:18:12,844 --> 02:18:19,383
MARISHA: Full disclosure, Tary, there aren't many
damsels you have to rescue in the wild. I've

2129
02:18:19,383 --> 02:18:27,573
learned mainly because women in the world have to
be tougher. So that doesn't happen very often.

2130
02:18:27,573 --> 02:18:37,428
But, if you want, we can make pretend and do a
little thought exercise, and I'll pretend to be in

2131
02:18:37,428 --> 02:18:44,060
distress and you can rescue me if that'll make you
feel better.

2132
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:46,635
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah, he just has to vanquish
me.

2133
02:18:46,635 --> 02:18:48,658
MARISHA: Yeah, but you have to vanquish Grog.

2134
02:18:48,658 --> 02:18:50,686
SAM: All right, let's go get drunk, then.

2135
02:18:50,686 --> 02:18:51,514
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Okay!

2136
02:18:51,514 --> 02:18:55,193
(all laugh)

2137
02:18:55,193 --> 02:18:59,986
LIAM: We really haven't had a barn-burner since we
got back from the big do, you know. We should get

2138
02:18:59,986 --> 02:19:05,056
your sister, we should get Shaun, we should get
Allura and Kima and anyone who's in town.

2139
02:19:05,056 --> 02:19:10,660
TALIESIN: Let's have a good drink, and in the
morning we'll set off on the next leg of idiocy.

2140
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:15,829
LIAM: Yeah, you know, Tary, there's something you
don't really know about-- we've just-- I mean,

2141
02:19:15,829 --> 02:19:20,290
it's really complicated, it's hard to explain to
you, you're an outsider. But we have just lost

2142
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:29,326
someone very dear to us. It's very complicated.
And maybe we're dealing with shit that is hard,

2143
02:19:29,326 --> 02:19:35,657
so I'm sorry if we pushed you too hard.
I think there was benefit to be had from what

2144
02:19:35,657 --> 02:19:44,806
just happened, but we're in a shitty headstate.
A dear friend is gone, so, apologies.

2145
02:19:44,806 --> 02:19:56,298
SAM: I understand. I haven't really experienced
loss of that type before. I mean. But I want to

2146
02:19:56,298 --> 02:20:04,069
understand, and I thank you for your honesty with
me and for not holding back.

2147
02:20:04,069 --> 02:20:07,684
Did I at least cause you some harm in the battle?

2148
02:20:07,684 --> 02:20:08,617
MARISHA: Yes!

2149
02:20:08,617 --> 02:20:11,635
LIAM: I thought you would go down in one shot,
and you were still standing!

2150
02:20:11,635 --> 02:20:12,978
TRAVIS: It was pretty weak, actually.

2151
02:20:12,978 --> 02:20:14,718
TALIESIN: I still feel a little ill.

2152
02:20:14,718 --> 02:20:18,249
MARISHA: Yeah! And look, you singed a little of my
hair!

2153
02:20:18,249 --> 02:20:19,426
SAM: That's good, right?

2154
02:20:19,426 --> 02:20:20,395
MARISHA: Yeah!

2155
02:20:20,395 --> 02:20:21,345
SAM: All right.

2156
02:20:21,345 --> 02:20:25,800
TALIESIN: To be fair, we've killed dragons,
so the fact that you actually managed to hold it

2157
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:28,107
together is actually quite impressive!

2158
02:20:28,107 --> 02:20:32,199
LIAM: I mean, clearly we've been fucking with you
a little bit, but you have ability and skill,

2159
02:20:32,199 --> 02:20:34,656
and that's not bullshit. Seriously.

2160
02:20:34,656 --> 02:20:36,632
TRAVIS: Yeah, the rest's just fake it 'til you
make it, yeah?

2161
02:20:36,632 --> 02:20:37,895
LIAM: Yeah. That will get you--

2162
02:20:37,895 --> 02:20:40,083
LAURA: I didn't see any of it, so I'm not sure.

2163
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:42,877
SAM: It was really great. It was really great?

2164
02:20:42,877 --> 02:20:43,431
TALIESIN: Yes!

2165
02:20:43,431 --> 02:20:45,230
LIAM: Yeah! Yes!

2166
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:52,616
SAM: Thank you, thank you all. I'm sorry for
deceiving you before, and I promise to do better

2167
02:20:52,616 --> 02:21:01,849
and to aid you in whatever way I can. Please teach
me your ways, and I will learn what I can.

2168
02:21:01,849 --> 02:21:04,473
TRAVIS: Did you build Dotty?

2169
02:21:04,473 --> 02:21:07,291
SAM: For heaven's sake, yes! I did.

2170
02:21:07,291 --> 02:21:09,773
LIAM: I believe him, I believe him.

2171
02:21:09,773 --> 02:21:11,930
TRAVIS: Let's open him up and figure out if he's
lying.

2172
02:21:11,930 --> 02:21:13,045
SAM: Please no, no, I, no--

2173
02:21:13,045 --> 02:21:14,439
TALIESIN: No no no no no.

2174
02:21:14,505 --> 02:21:15,817
LAURA: (laughs) Grog!

2175
02:21:15,817 --> 02:21:16,534
TRAVIS: What.

2176
02:21:16,534 --> 02:21:17,713
LAURA: Stop. (laughs)

2177
02:21:17,713 --> 02:21:20,959
LIAM: (whispers) He's just-- he's fucking with
you, it's fine. (normal volume) It's all right.

2178
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:22,766
It's all right. Let's go get drunk.

2179
02:21:22,766 --> 02:21:23,654
MARISHA: Yeah!

2180
02:21:23,654 --> 02:21:24,695
LAURA: That's all we do.

2181
02:21:24,695 --> 02:21:25,883
LIAM: Yeah.

2182
02:21:25,883 --> 02:21:27,579
MARISHA: Get drunk and make people cry.

2183
02:21:27,579 --> 02:21:28,815
LIAM: It's been too long, are you kidding?

2184
02:21:28,815 --> 02:21:33,536
SAM: All right, I hang back just a little bit to
collect myself. Just try to dry my eyes,

2185
02:21:33,536 --> 02:21:38,406
and I say to Doty: Doty, just delete most of that
last chapter--

2186
02:21:38,406 --> 02:21:41,806
MATT: (sounds of Doty ripping and crumpling paper)

2187
02:21:41,806 --> 02:21:51,356
SAM: -- and take this down. "The battle a draw,
Taryon decided it was better to lie than tell the

2188
02:21:51,422 --> 02:22:00,662
"truth, and embarked on a new adventure pretending
to be their humble intern, when in actuality,

2189
02:22:00,662 --> 02:22:06,634
"they were working for him." End of chapter!

2190
02:22:06,634 --> 02:22:10,748
MATT: (sounds of book slamming shut and Doty
walking)

2191
02:22:10,748 --> 02:22:12,900
LIAM: Oh my gosh, that can go in any direction.

2192
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,953
TALIESIN: I love it.

2193
02:22:13,953 --> 02:22:15,856
LAURA: So dark. SO DARK!

2194
02:22:15,856 --> 02:22:17,241
TRAVIS: We're getting to the deep end!

2195
02:22:17,241 --> 02:22:21,067
MATT: (chuckles) As Doty follows you, you guys
make your way into the castle. Wine bottles are

2196
02:22:21,067 --> 02:22:28,265
brought about, and a raucous evening of drinking
is easily found. The barn-burner you're looking

2197
02:22:28,265 --> 02:22:35,063
for: Shaun is able to be mustered, Jarrett,
Kima's still back in Emon, and actually Allura is

2198
02:22:35,063 --> 02:22:40,037
in town briefly to retrieve Pike. And as Pike
comes in, she reaches you guys.

2199
02:22:40,037 --> 02:22:48,082
"Hi. Apparently there's still a lot of recovery
that's needed in Emon and they need kind of an

2200
02:22:48,082 --> 02:22:51,248
"all-hands-on-deck circumstance with anyone who's
trained in healing,

2201
02:22:51,248 --> 02:22:55,465
"so I may have to go help with that for a little
bit, if that's okay?"

2202
02:22:55,465 --> 02:22:56,469
LIAM: Oh, man.

2203
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:57,453
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course!

2204
02:22:57,453 --> 02:22:58,517
LAURA: Whatever you need, dear.

2205
02:22:58,517 --> 02:23:04,662
MATT: I mean, don't-- don't go-- (sigh) don't go
to any crazy hell places without me, let me know

2206
02:23:04,662 --> 02:23:06,185
before that happens, please.

2207
02:23:06,185 --> 02:23:06,984
LAURA: Oh. Right.

2208
02:23:06,984 --> 02:23:08,153
TRAVIS: (scoffs) No, we would never!

2209
02:23:08,153 --> 02:23:09,656
SAM: That's exactly what they're planning on
doing!

2210
02:23:09,656 --> 02:23:11,107
TRAVIS: No, Tary, what did we say about lying?

2211
02:23:11,107 --> 02:23:13,916
SAM: They just said that they're taking me to
hell, or something like that!

2212
02:23:13,916 --> 02:23:15,849
LAURA: Well, we won't, obviously, if you don't
want us to, Pike.

2213
02:23:15,849 --> 02:23:17,467
TALIESIN: We've decided to go a little softer with
him.

2214
02:23:17,467 --> 02:23:18,888
LIAM: We're figuring it out.

2215
02:23:18,888 --> 02:23:20,779
MATT: I mean, try and at least let me know?

2216
02:23:20,779 --> 02:23:22,255
LAURA: 'Course.

2217
02:23:22,255 --> 02:23:26,357
MARISHA: Pike, I have to eventually go visit the
Water Ashari,

2218
02:23:26,357 --> 02:23:29,693
but I didn't want to do that without you.

2219
02:23:29,693 --> 02:23:33,135
MATT: It's fine, go! I mean, I don't know how much
help I'll be other than just getting you there,

2220
02:23:33,135 --> 02:23:38,989
but there's plenty of people that can, you know,
helm a ship and get you across the sea.

2221
02:23:38,989 --> 02:23:43,196
MARISHA: Is there any advice you can give?

2222
02:23:43,196 --> 02:23:47,949
MATT: Hire a good crew. Really. I was but one of
many and everything I learned, I learned from

2223
02:23:47,949 --> 02:23:51,600
watching other people. You might learn more than I
did!

2224
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,403
MARISHA: All right.

2225
02:23:53,403 --> 02:23:54,755
MATT:Okay?

2226
02:23:54,755 --> 02:23:56,198
MARISHA: Okay.

2227
02:23:56,198 --> 02:24:01,277
LAURA: Pike. I step away with her.

2228
02:24:01,277 --> 02:24:04,797
(all laugh)

2229
02:24:04,797 --> 02:24:11,479
LAURA: How are you? I mean, you're heading off to
Emon right after Scanlan left, does this have

2230
02:24:11,479 --> 02:24:13,188
anything to do with him?

2231
02:24:13,188 --> 02:24:17,594
MATT: I could use the distraction, to be honest.
You'll be fine, I mean, it's all tying up loose

2232
02:24:17,594 --> 02:24:27,021
ends, and I'm more needed helping people that
really need what I can do right now.

2233
02:24:27,021 --> 02:24:29,530
LAURA: I understand.

2234
02:24:29,530 --> 02:24:32,668
MATT: It won't be long, they're gathering a lot of
great healers.

2235
02:24:32,668 --> 02:24:34,405
I know Keeper Yennen's coming along--

2236
02:24:34,405 --> 02:24:35,496
LAURA: Oh, good.

2237
02:24:35,496 --> 02:24:38,045
MATT: -- and we're gonna be doing some people some
real good.

2238
02:24:38,045 --> 02:24:39,699
LAURA: All right.

2239
02:24:39,699 --> 02:24:45,047
MATT: Might even bring the love of my Lady to a
few people.

2240
02:24:45,047 --> 02:24:49,248
Her light can definitely heal a lot of
wounds and spirits, so.

2241
02:24:49,248 --> 02:24:54,224
LAURA: All right. I give her a big hug, and I
whisper in her ear.

2242
02:24:54,224 --> 02:24:57,589
You don't always have to put
on a brave face, dear.

2243
02:24:57,589 --> 02:25:02,114
MATT: She pulls back from you and kind of pats you
on the side of your face.

2244
02:25:02,114 --> 02:25:11,555
MATT: "Yeah, I do." And she smiles and turns
around and puts her hand out, and Allura takes her

2245
02:25:11,555 --> 02:25:14,058
hand. 
"Are we ready?"

2246
02:25:14,058 --> 02:25:16,637
TRAVIS: Wait, bye, Pike!

2247
02:25:16,637 --> 02:25:19,695
MATT: She lets go of Allura's hand, runs up real
fast, and just slugs you in the face--

2248
02:25:19,695 --> 02:25:20,330
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2249
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:21,637
MATT: -- and jumps into your arms.

2250
02:25:21,637 --> 02:25:22,258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2251
02:25:22,258 --> 02:25:23,485
MATT: Ohh.

2252
02:25:23,485 --> 02:25:26,027
TRAVIS: You go be a monster, and you heal all the
people.

2253
02:25:26,027 --> 02:25:26,916
MATT: I will!

2254
02:25:26,916 --> 02:25:27,998
TRAVIS: All right.

2255
02:25:27,998 --> 02:25:28,832
MATT: Okay.

2256
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:29,840
TRAVIS: Okay, bye.

2257
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:32,056
MATT: "Bye." She turns around and runs back to
Allura.

2258
02:25:32,056 --> 02:25:33,061
LIAM: It's pretty good.

2259
02:25:33,061 --> 02:25:34,125
TRAVIS: That got harder, man, damn.

2260
02:25:34,125 --> 02:25:36,882
LIAM: It's pretty good.

2261
02:25:36,882 --> 02:25:40,492
MATT: After Yennen is summoned forth, the three of
them vanish into a swirl of arcane energy,

2262
02:25:40,492 --> 02:25:42,418
towards the direction of Emon.

2263
02:25:42,418 --> 02:25:47,046
LAURA: (exhales) First one goes, then the other.

2264
02:25:47,046 --> 02:25:48,417
TALIESIN: She'll be back.

2265
02:25:48,417 --> 02:25:51,326
LAURA: (sighs)

2266
02:25:51,326 --> 02:25:52,527
LIAM: We're gnomeless.

2267
02:25:52,527 --> 02:25:53,781
LAURA: Gnomeless.

2268
02:25:53,781 --> 02:25:56,981
SAM: Was that your girlfriend, Jumbo?

2269
02:25:57,185 --> 02:25:58,618
TRAVIS: What'd you say?

2270
02:25:58,618 --> 02:25:59,863
SAM: Was that your girlfriend?

2271
02:25:59,863 --> 02:26:02,157
LIAM: (sharp inhale) We just got good.

2272
02:26:02,157 --> 02:26:06,320
SAM: Oh. Sorry. I don't-- I'm just trying to catch
up. I'll--

2273
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:07,332
TALIESIN: That's fair, that's fair.

2274
02:26:07,332 --> 02:26:08,158
TRAVIS: Let me see your hand.

2275
02:26:08,158 --> 02:26:09,123
LAURA: It's a fair question.

2276
02:26:09,123 --> 02:26:09,831
SAM: My hand?

2277
02:26:09,831 --> 02:26:10,680
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold your hand out.

2278
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:11,438
SAM: My hand?

2279
02:26:11,438 --> 02:26:12,166
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it in mine.

2280
02:26:12,166 --> 02:26:19,017
SAM: Please don't kill me.

2281
02:26:19,017 --> 02:26:19,673
MARISHA: Aw.

2282
02:26:19,673 --> 02:26:20,825
TALIESIN: Aw.

2283
02:26:20,825 --> 02:26:24,685
MARISHA: That was a good exercise in restraint,
Grog. Proud of you.

2284
02:26:24,685 --> 02:26:32,302
TRAVIS: (grumbling)

2285
02:26:32,302 --> 02:26:36,242
LIAM: Come here. Tell me more about your father.

2286
02:26:36,242 --> 02:26:44,568
SAM: He's really a rotten guy. (sighs) He does
these unfair deals-- nobody knows about them but

2287
02:26:44,568 --> 02:26:49,978
me, and I tried to tell him to play on the up and
up but he's just a liar and a cheat.

2288
02:26:49,978 --> 02:26:51,930
LIAM: That's terrible. Drink up, by the way.

2289
02:26:51,930 --> 02:26:54,430
SAM: Oh, thank you.

2290
02:26:54,430 --> 02:27:00,364
MARISHA: So how long have you been set forth on
your little mission to prove yourself worthy?

2291
02:27:00,364 --> 02:27:03,233
SAM: Month, month and a half.

2292
02:27:03,233 --> 02:27:06,053
LIAM: Really?

2293
02:27:06,053 --> 02:27:09,020
MARISHA: Welcome aboard the proving-yourself
train.

2294
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:12,333
SAM: I hired a band of mercenaries to assist me
for the first month.

2295
02:27:12,333 --> 02:27:14,064
LAURA: Did you really get them killed?

2296
02:27:14,064 --> 02:27:15,189
SAM: No, they left me.

2297
02:27:15,189 --> 02:27:16,674
(all laugh)

2298
02:27:16,674 --> 02:27:17,610
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2299
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:18,661
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

2300
02:27:18,661 --> 02:27:22,137
MATT: Yeah.

2301
02:27:22,137 --> 02:27:23,453
LAURA: Natural 20.

2302
02:27:23,453 --> 02:27:24,737
MARISHA: (gasps)

2303
02:27:24,737 --> 02:27:26,062
SAM: Truth.

2304
02:27:26,062 --> 02:27:28,414
LAURA: All right.

2305
02:27:28,414 --> 02:27:32,305
TRAVIS: Is that your real name?

2306
02:27:32,305 --> 02:27:33,687
SAM: Yes, it is.

2307
02:27:33,687 --> 02:27:36,966
TRAVIS: Thought you would've made a shitty name
like that one up.

2308
02:27:36,966 --> 02:27:39,054
SAM: Taryon Gary Darrington.

2309
02:27:39,054 --> 02:27:42,200
(all laugh)

2310
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:44,595
MARISHA: Wow, your dad really is an asshole.

2311
02:27:44,595 --> 02:27:45,762
SAM: Yes, he is.

2312
02:27:45,762 --> 02:27:46,408
LIAM: No.

2313
02:27:46,408 --> 02:27:48,329
TALIESIN: How's your sister, at least? Is your
sister reasonable?

2314
02:27:48,329 --> 02:27:50,569
SAM: She's the fucking worst.

2315
02:27:50,569 --> 02:27:51,523
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

2316
02:27:51,523 --> 02:27:52,228
MARISHA: What?

2317
02:27:52,228 --> 02:27:59,477
SAM: Yes, she's so-- She's such a jock. She just
does push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups all day and

2318
02:27:59,477 --> 02:28:04,932
all night and beats on me. She's younger than me,
but she's so much stronger.

2319
02:28:04,932 --> 02:28:06,228
TRAVIS: What's her name?

2320
02:28:06,228 --> 02:28:09,490
SAM: Her name is-- I wrote this down.

2321
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:11,867
LAURA: What's my sister's name? You don't know!

2322
02:28:11,867 --> 02:28:15,792
SAM: (ugly cries)

2323
02:28:15,792 --> 02:28:17,945
(all laugh)

2324
02:28:17,945 --> 02:28:18,862
SAM: Mary-Anne.

2325
02:28:18,862 --> 02:28:19,671
LAURA: Mary-Anne Darrington.

2326
02:28:19,671 --> 02:28:20,486
TRAVIS: Mary-Anne.

2327
02:28:20,486 --> 02:28:21,496
SAM: Mary-Anne Darrington.

2328
02:28:21,496 --> 02:28:22,586
TALIESIN: Mary-Anne. Marian Darrington.

2329
02:28:22,586 --> 02:28:24,028
LAURA: Marion Darrington.

2330
02:28:24,028 --> 02:28:24,821
TRAVIS: Is she older, or younger?

2331
02:28:24,821 --> 02:28:25,619
TALIESIN: Marion Darrington.

2332
02:28:25,619 --> 02:28:26,734
MARISHA: Marion Darrington. (laughs)

2333
02:28:26,734 --> 02:28:27,520
SAM: My father, Howard--

2334
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,456
TALIESIN: He is the worst person.

2335
02:28:28,456 --> 02:28:29,872
SAM: -- and my mom, Maria.

2336
02:28:29,872 --> 02:28:30,619
MARISHA: Maria.

2337
02:28:30,619 --> 02:28:32,028
TRAVIS: Is Mary-Anne older or younger than you?

2338
02:28:32,028 --> 02:28:32,708
TALIESIN: Younger.

2339
02:28:32,708 --> 02:28:33,584
SAM: Younger!

2340
02:28:33,584 --> 02:28:34,535
TRAVIS: Is she married?

2341
02:28:34,535 --> 02:28:36,090
SAM: No. She's not a married Marion.

2342
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:38,808
(all laugh)

2343
02:28:38,808 --> 02:28:40,294
TALIESIN: She's a maid Marion?

2344
02:28:40,294 --> 02:28:41,190
LAURA: Oh...

2345
02:28:41,190 --> 02:28:42,325
MARISHA: She's a maid Marion.

2346
02:28:42,325 --> 02:28:44,622
TALIESIN: No. Maid Marion Darrington.

2347
02:28:44,622 --> 02:28:50,180
SAM: She's all focused on the business, and taking
it over when Dad's ready to retire.

2348
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:51,815
TALIESIN: Then she'll be a made maid Marion.

2349
02:28:51,815 --> 02:28:56,211
(all laugh)

2350
02:28:56,211 --> 02:28:56,840
TRAVIS: Wow...

2351
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:57,944
TALIESIN: I may be drunk.

2352
02:28:57,944 --> 02:28:59,937
(all laugh)

2353
02:28:59,937 --> 02:29:00,707
MARISHA: That's fun.

2354
02:29:00,707 --> 02:29:04,546
LIAM: Was there anything good about your
upbringing? Any positive points?

2355
02:29:04,546 --> 02:29:13,440
SAM: Yes. Yes, I learned so much. I was left to my
own devices for hours on end. I traveled the

2356
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:23,082
world... in literature. And I experienced such
great adventures, tales of history and fiction

2357
02:29:23,082 --> 02:29:32,722
and-- For most of my life, I was just a
happy-go-lucky kid in my room. Reading my books,

2358
02:29:32,722 --> 02:29:40,330
and making up characters that I would fight
against, and only recently have things gotten

2359
02:29:40,330 --> 02:29:46,279
pretty bad with Dad, since I am now of age to take
over the business, and uh--

2360
02:29:46,279 --> 02:29:48,448
LIAM: At the early age of 28?

2361
02:29:48,448 --> 02:29:54,976
SAM: Well, he's getting up in years. Wants to
retire to the southern villa.

2362
02:29:54,976 --> 02:29:57,849
TALIESIN: This is such a dark mirror. This is a
very dark mirror.

2363
02:29:57,849 --> 02:30:07,558
MARISHA: I'm concerned-- I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Tary. That was a Freudian slip. Why does your

2364
02:30:07,558 --> 02:30:14,792
father think it's important to have brute strength
and combat experience to run a business?

2365
02:30:14,792 --> 02:30:21,489
SAM: It's less about strength and more about a
cutthroat attitude. Take no prisoners. Hold back

2366
02:30:21,489 --> 02:30:23,566
nothing. Pull no punches.

2367
02:30:23,566 --> 02:30:27,531
MARISHA: Are you sure your father's a real estate
agent?

2368
02:30:27,531 --> 02:30:38,413
SAM: To be honest, he doesn't take me along with
him to many business deals, but he has great

2369
02:30:38,413 --> 02:30:44,864
influence over many places and cities, and
important people, and I don't exactly know the ins

2370
02:30:44,864 --> 02:30:46,517
and outs of the business--

2371
02:30:46,588 --> 02:30:56,333
SAM: But (inhales) I do know that he is ruthless
and a bastard, if you ask me truthfully.

2372
02:30:56,775 --> 02:30:58,971
LIAM: Literally?

2373
02:30:58,971 --> 02:31:05,531
SAM: No, I mean, we had a grandfather, so I-- I
mean, I think he's not really a bastard. I think.

2374
02:31:05,531 --> 02:31:06,820
I don't know. What do you mean?

2375
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:08,508
(all laugh)

2376
02:31:08,508 --> 02:31:16,075
LIAM: I mean. What do I mean? I mean, was he the
offspring of--

2377
02:31:16,075 --> 02:31:18,358
SAM: He has a father.

2378
02:31:18,358 --> 02:31:23,535
LIAM: I'm sure he does. Was he married to your
mother?

2379
02:31:23,535 --> 02:31:26,385
SAM: I think so. They were around a lot.

2380
02:31:26,437 --> 02:31:28,178
LIAM: So you mean, shithead?

2381
02:31:28,178 --> 02:31:29,557
SAM: He's an asshole.

2382
02:31:29,557 --> 02:31:30,523
LIAM: All right.

2383
02:31:30,523 --> 02:31:32,131
MARISHA: That's a long walk to get to shithead.

2384
02:31:32,131 --> 02:31:33,378
TALIESIN: That was a long walk to--

2385
02:31:33,378 --> 02:31:35,207
LIAM: There's a lot of backstory here that you're
not privy to.

2386
02:31:35,207 --> 02:31:38,434
MARISHA: What's your father's name?

2387
02:31:38,434 --> 02:31:38,839
SAM: Howard.

2388
02:31:38,839 --> 02:31:39,569
TALIESIN: Howard.

2389
02:31:39,569 --> 02:31:40,403
LIAM: Howard.

2390
02:31:40,403 --> 02:31:41,567
LAURA: Howard Darrington.

2391
02:31:41,567 --> 02:31:42,975
TRAVIS: C'mon, note-taker.

2392
02:31:42,975 --> 02:31:48,172
TALIESIN: Show him your tattoo, I'm just sort of
curious. I just had a thought.

2393
02:31:48,172 --> 02:31:53,386
LIAM: My tattoo? What? The Slayer's Take?

2394
02:31:53,386 --> 02:31:54,461
TALIESIN: --the Clasp.

2395
02:31:54,461 --> 02:31:57,246
LIAM: That's a fucking Keyleth palm at this
point.

2396
02:31:57,246 --> 02:31:58,450
MARISHA: I removed it.

2397
02:31:58,450 --> 02:31:59,224
TALIESIN: You did?

2398
02:31:59,224 --> 02:32:00,026
LAURA: Oh...

2399
02:32:00,026 --> 02:32:01,098
MARISHA: I burnt it off of him.

2400
02:32:01,098 --> 02:32:11,901
TALIESIN: You're gonna make me draw it? That's
fine. I'm doing the Clasp logo, if I-- Does this

2401
02:32:11,901 --> 02:32:14,957
look at all familiar? I have the Clasp logo.

2402
02:32:14,957 --> 02:32:16,121
MATT: Yeah, it does not.

2403
02:32:16,121 --> 02:32:17,599
MARISHA: Hashtag Clasp.

2404
02:32:17,599 --> 02:32:18,346
TALIESIN: Hashtag Clasp.

2405
02:32:18,346 --> 02:32:19,295
MARISHA: Interesting.

2406
02:32:19,295 --> 02:32:24,324
SAM: No. You're all literate? You can read and
write?

2407
02:32:24,324 --> 02:32:25,689
TALIESIN: Most of us, yes.

2408
02:32:25,689 --> 02:32:29,170
SAM: Wow. I haven't met many of you in my travels
that have--

2409
02:32:29,170 --> 02:32:31,069
TALIESIN: We even have a library.

2410
02:32:31,069 --> 02:32:32,460
SAM: That's amazing.

2411
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:33,577
LAURA: Big one.

2412
02:32:33,577 --> 02:32:37,518
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, he's particularly brainy.
You guys have a lot in common.

2413
02:32:37,518 --> 02:32:39,189
TALIESIN: We have quite a nice library.

2414
02:32:39,189 --> 02:32:42,122
LIAM: I mean, there's a lot of differences between
the two of you, but you have a lot in common.

2415
02:32:42,122 --> 02:32:42,777
SAM: Really?

2416
02:32:42,777 --> 02:32:43,461
LIAM: Yeah.

2417
02:32:43,461 --> 02:32:45,158
TALIESIN: Horrifyingly, yes.

2418
02:32:45,158 --> 02:32:46,786
LAURA: Yeah.

2419
02:32:46,786 --> 02:32:48,849
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was a bit of a reader growing
up.

2420
02:32:48,849 --> 02:32:49,718
SAM: Oh?

2421
02:32:49,718 --> 02:32:55,322
TALIESIN: Yes. Fiction and non-fiction. A bit of
everything. I was a--

2422
02:32:55,322 --> 02:32:58,075
SAM: Perhaps we can compare books later?

2423
02:32:58,075 --> 02:33:00,346
TALIESIN: I will happily show you my library.

2424
02:33:00,346 --> 02:33:01,981
LIAM: Huh.

2425
02:33:01,981 --> 02:33:03,566
SAM: This guy-- This excites me.

2426
02:33:03,566 --> 02:33:05,234
TALIESIN: Stop. Stop smiling at that.

2427
02:33:05,234 --> 02:33:08,601
LIAM: You can teach him the art of nerd chic,
Percy.

2428
02:33:08,601 --> 02:33:11,538
TALIESIN: He seems to be well-built for it.

2429
02:33:11,538 --> 02:33:13,900
MARISHA: You know, Percy is a bit of a tinkerer
himself as well.

2430
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:14,794
TALIESIN: I do... Yeah.

2431
02:33:14,794 --> 02:33:15,430
SAM: Really?

2432
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:17,075
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, I've built a few things.

2433
02:33:17,075 --> 02:33:23,701
SAM: That piece of equipment you showed to that
weirdo earlier today-- the thing with the handle?

2434
02:33:23,701 --> 02:33:24,607
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2435
02:33:24,607 --> 02:33:25,947
SAM: Did you make that?

2436
02:33:25,947 --> 02:33:31,765
TALIESIN: I didn't make that, but I did make this
one. And I pull down the folded ridiculous--

2437
02:33:31,765 --> 02:33:32,879
MATT: Bad News contraption?

2438
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:33,922
TALIESIN: Bad News.

2439
02:33:33,922 --> 02:33:36,126
TALIESIN: Um, yeah.

2440
02:33:36,126 --> 02:33:38,829
LAURA: I keep filling up Grog's mug, to make sure
he gets his fill.

2441
02:33:38,829 --> 02:33:41,493
SAM: What does that-- What does that do?

2442
02:33:41,493 --> 02:33:47,035
TALIESIN: It takes these-- and I pull out a musket
ball-- and it fires them at great speed.

2443
02:33:47,035 --> 02:33:51,040
In whatever direction I like.

2444
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,215
SAM: That is--

2445
02:33:52,215 --> 02:33:53,690
TALIESIN: Very dangerous--

2446
02:33:53,690 --> 02:33:54,658
SAM: Sexy.

2447
02:33:54,658 --> 02:33:55,834
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's very dangerous.

2448
02:33:55,834 --> 02:33:56,728
SAM: It's very sexy.

2449
02:33:56,728 --> 02:33:58,072
TALIESIN: Thank you. I think so.

2450
02:33:58,072 --> 02:33:59,717
SAM: Wow. And did you make this by yourself?

2451
02:33:59,717 --> 02:34:03,910
TALIESIN: I did. This took about six months? Seven
months? I mean, I'd been thinking about it for

2452
02:34:03,910 --> 02:34:05,496
quite a while. I'm working on a few others, too--

2453
02:34:05,496 --> 02:34:06,390
SAM: Wow.

2454
02:34:06,390 --> 02:34:07,762
LIAM: Oh, I didn't know that.

2455
02:34:07,762 --> 02:34:09,769
TALIESIN: This is kind of the definitive-- Yes,
this is when we were all--

2456
02:34:09,769 --> 02:34:11,408
MARISHA: Built it on our little summer vacation.

2457
02:34:11,408 --> 02:34:12,954
TALIESIN: -- on the last time we took a break.

2458
02:34:12,954 --> 02:34:17,281
SAM: Is the propellant part of this piece right
here? Or is it in that big piece right there?

2459
02:34:17,281 --> 02:34:18,403
TALIESIN: Ah, neither. It's in this--

2460
02:34:18,403 --> 02:34:19,580
SAM: Or is it magical?

2461
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:24,055
TALIESIN: No, it's not magical at all. Everything
in this is purely physical.

2462
02:34:24,055 --> 02:34:25,696
No magic involved whatsoever.

2463
02:34:25,696 --> 02:34:26,314
SAM: Oh...

2464
02:34:26,314 --> 02:34:27,036
TALIESIN: Yes.

2465
02:34:27,036 --> 02:34:27,712
SAM: Wow.

2466
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:28,815
LIAM: What do you make of all this?

2467
02:34:28,815 --> 02:34:29,587
SAM: That's impressive.

2468
02:34:29,587 --> 02:34:30,311
LAURA: Huh?

2469
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:31,310
TALIESIN: Showing the mechanism off.

2470
02:34:31,310 --> 02:34:32,468
LIAM: I don't know-- nerd talk?

2471
02:34:32,468 --> 02:34:34,073
LAURA: I think it's great.

2472
02:34:34,073 --> 02:34:34,824
LIAM: Yeah?

2473
02:34:34,824 --> 02:34:35,689
LAURA: Uh-huh.

2474
02:34:35,689 --> 02:34:37,305
LIAM: What do you think of the new guy?

2475
02:34:37,305 --> 02:34:40,496
LAURA: Oh, yeah. He's weird? I don't know.

2476
02:34:40,496 --> 02:34:41,978
LIAM: I mean, he's not Scanlan.

2477
02:34:41,978 --> 02:34:43,268
LAURA: No.

2478
02:34:43,268 --> 02:34:44,126
LIAM: No.

2479
02:34:44,126 --> 02:34:45,922
LAURA: Nobody is.

2480
02:34:45,922 --> 02:34:51,281
SAM: Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. One second.
I forgot, I owe you some money, don't I?

2481
02:34:51,281 --> 02:34:56,041
LAURA: Yes you do.

2482
02:34:56,041 --> 02:35:00,144
SAM: The adventure was 50 thousand, correct?

2483
02:35:00,144 --> 02:35:01,690
LAURA: Yes, it was.

2484
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:10,532
SAM: I think I had a good adventure today.
But I didn't die. So, minus the Prismatic Spray,

2485
02:35:10,532 --> 02:35:14,838
that's 6000 gold taken off. Minus the wear and
tear on my armor and equipment,

2486
02:35:14,838 --> 02:35:17,071
that's another 5000 taken off.

2487
02:35:17,071 --> 02:35:18,633
LAURA: Darling, this wasn't part of the deal.

2488
02:35:18,633 --> 02:35:23,811
SAM: Minus the fact that I wasn't the star of the
adventure, I'll halve the rest of it. Do you have

2489
02:35:23,811 --> 02:35:27,960
a tax ID or some sort of tax-exempt status?

2490
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:34,100
LIAM: Wait, you need to be the lead character in
your death-taunting?

2491
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:35,649
Is that what you're telling us?

2492
02:35:35,649 --> 02:35:37,765
SAM: I'm just trying to find out how much I
actually owe you.

2493
02:35:37,765 --> 02:35:42,429
LAURA: No contract stipulations when we made the
deal, therefore, you pay full price, darling.

2494
02:35:42,429 --> 02:35:48,013
SAM: I am a man of business and I always follow
the law. So by my calculations, 20% federal taxes,

2495
02:35:48,013 --> 02:35:56,702
9.5% local and city taxes, I put that at about
11,000 gold total left still. Doty?

2496
02:35:56,702 --> 02:35:59,016
TALIESIN: Technically, she is tax-exempt.

2497
02:35:59,016 --> 02:36:00,202
SAM: Write a check.

2498
02:36:00,202 --> 02:36:01,301
LAURA: A check?

2499
02:36:01,301 --> 02:36:02,267
SAM: Of course.

2500
02:36:02,267 --> 02:36:03,530
TALIESIN: She is tax-exempt.

2501
02:36:03,530 --> 02:36:05,806
SAM: How is she tax-exempt?

2502
02:36:05,806 --> 02:36:10,603
TALIESIN: She's a baroness.

2503
02:36:10,603 --> 02:36:11,708
SAM: Make it 16.

2504
02:36:11,708 --> 02:36:19,745
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2505
02:36:19,745 --> 02:36:21,437
SAM: My father will pay that. In full.

2506
02:36:21,437 --> 02:36:23,323
LAURA: Oh, dear lord.

2507
02:36:23,323 --> 02:36:25,374
TALIESIN: We can put it in the treasury,
technically.

2508
02:36:25,374 --> 02:36:26,763
MARISHA: Did he just give us an IOU?

2509
02:36:26,763 --> 02:36:31,487
TRAVIS: What about all the jingly-jangly in your
bag of holding?

2510
02:36:31,487 --> 02:36:34,507
SAM: Go on and reach in there.

2511
02:36:34,507 --> 02:36:35,933
LAURA: I know how bags of holding work.

2512
02:36:35,933 --> 02:36:38,111
TRAVIS: I'll just stick my hand in the bag of
holding.

2513
02:36:38,111 --> 02:36:42,616
MATT: It is empty. What are you thinking of while
you reach in there?

2514
02:36:42,616 --> 02:36:43,446
TRAVIS: Candy.

2515
02:36:43,446 --> 02:36:46,140
(all laugh)

2516
02:36:46,140 --> 02:36:47,330
MATT: Does he find candy?

2517
02:36:47,330 --> 02:36:48,041
SAM: Nope.

2518
02:36:48,041 --> 02:36:50,255
MATT: Nope. It's just a void, an empty sack.

2519
02:36:50,255 --> 02:36:55,740
TRAVIS: This is bullshit! You can't come with us.

2520
02:36:55,740 --> 02:37:01,756
SAM: Is he holding any equipment or weapons?

2521
02:37:01,756 --> 02:37:05,062
MATT: The weapon is near him, but not currently on
him.

2522
02:37:05,062 --> 02:37:09,738
SAM: Okay. Fire. And I set his weapon on fire.

2523
02:37:09,738 --> 02:37:13,710
MATT: You watch as your hammer just ignites with
flame.

2524
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:14,832
TRAVIS: You better put that out.

2525
02:37:14,832 --> 02:37:16,437
SAM: It's cool, though, right?

2526
02:37:16,437 --> 02:37:17,723
TRAVIS: You burning my hammer?

2527
02:37:17,723 --> 02:37:21,562
SAM: No, no, it's magical, it's good. It helps!

2528
02:37:21,562 --> 02:37:23,013
TRAVIS: I touch it.

2529
02:37:23,013 --> 02:37:23,914
MATT: It burns your hand.

2530
02:37:23,914 --> 02:37:24,920
(all laugh)

2531
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:28,693
SAM: Why would you touch a flame?

2532
02:37:28,693 --> 02:37:29,967
TRAVIS: Because you said it was magical!

2533
02:37:29,967 --> 02:37:31,077
SAM: (whispers) Is he an idiot?

2534
02:37:31,077 --> 02:37:36,228
TALIESIN: Well... I don't feel like I can answer
that question appropriately at the moment.

2535
02:37:36,228 --> 02:37:38,768
MARISHA: Legally? Maybe?

2536
02:37:38,768 --> 02:37:41,965
TRAVIS: You know when people poke you in the
sternum with their finger? I do that with the

2537
02:37:41,965 --> 02:37:44,706
Titanstone Knuckle really hard.

2538
02:37:44,706 --> 02:37:46,432
MATT: Yeah, it hurts.

2539
02:37:46,432 --> 02:37:49,820
TALIESIN: I pour more wine for him. More wine.
More wine.

2540
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:52,158
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just getting used
to this.

2541
02:37:52,158 --> 02:37:53,915
TALIESIN: No, you're fitting in very well.

2542
02:37:53,915 --> 02:38:00,208
TRAVIS: You have your strengths, and while you may
be able to "read" with your friends over there,

2543
02:38:00,208 --> 02:38:03,776
I think it's also important to work on your
weaknesses.

2544
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:04,915
SAM: All right.

2545
02:38:04,915 --> 02:38:09,639
TRAVIS: Yeah, so we gotta work on your bravery,
maybe your fighting voice.

2546
02:38:09,639 --> 02:38:10,798
SAM: Absolutely.

2547
02:38:10,798 --> 02:38:11,997
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2548
02:38:11,997 --> 02:38:15,704
SAM: Was it really bad? Did I sound okay?

2549
02:38:15,704 --> 02:38:19,728
LAURA: No, I mean, I wasn't there to witness it,
I just know your normal voice.

2550
02:38:19,782 --> 02:38:21,917
TRAVIS: When you were flying over the city,
did it sound like

2551
02:38:21,917 --> 02:38:24,998
a llama being mauled by a pack of wolves?

2552
02:38:24,998 --> 02:38:28,110
LAURA: I heard this braying. I thought it was a
goat, actually.

2553
02:38:28,110 --> 02:38:29,006
TRAVIS: That was him.

2554
02:38:29,006 --> 02:38:30,094
LAURA: Oh.

2555
02:38:30,094 --> 02:38:32,730
TALIESIN: What a picture you just painted.
That was lovely.

2556
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:35,386
TRAVIS: Yeah. Big tall neck, all furry.

2557
02:38:35,386 --> 02:38:37,852
TALIESIN: No, I heard the llama.

2558
02:38:37,852 --> 02:38:43,523
LIAM: I'm gonna squish in next to him and put my
arm around with an ale and say, I don't know why I

2559
02:38:43,523 --> 02:38:51,208
am suddenly taking a shine to you when I felt like
I hated you a couple hours ago. Just stick with

2560
02:38:51,208 --> 02:38:58,069
us. You don't have to know-- I hear everything
you're saying. You're an asshole, and I love you,

2561
02:38:58,069 --> 02:39:03,101
but you really are an asshole. I'm just talking
to the guy. I have taken a shine to you,

2562
02:39:03,101 --> 02:39:07,808
and I'm gonna look out for you, all right? The
first time I got attacked I was a fucking mess.

2563
02:39:07,808 --> 02:39:12,485
I'm still a fucking mess. That's the thing,
people are writing stories about us, we're a

2564
02:39:12,485 --> 02:39:16,719
bunch of fucking shitheads, and nobody talks about
that-- maybe a few people do.

2565
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:17,891
TALIESIN: A few people do talk about that.

2566
02:39:17,891 --> 02:39:19,523
LIAM: A few people do talk about that.

2567
02:39:19,523 --> 02:39:20,478
MARISHA: I think more than a few.

2568
02:39:20,478 --> 02:39:21,787
LAURA: A lot of people talk about that.

2569
02:39:21,787 --> 02:39:25,488
LIAM: There's no way to prepare, you just have to
hit your face against the wall a couple of times,

2570
02:39:25,488 --> 02:39:27,927
then it starts to feel normal-ish.

2571
02:39:27,927 --> 02:39:29,187
TRAVIS: I can help you with that.

2572
02:39:29,187 --> 02:39:31,376
LIAM: Yeah.

2573
02:39:31,376 --> 02:39:32,301
SAM: Thank you.

2574
02:39:32,301 --> 02:39:34,250
LIAM: You're good, you've done it, you've been
hazed, you're good, kid.

2575
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:41,495
SAM: I am so appreciative of all of you,
and I will repay this debt, I promise you.

2576
02:39:41,495 --> 02:39:45,629
I will make you guest-stars in one chapter of my
book,

2577
02:39:45,629 --> 02:39:49,723
and it will be top three most epic chapters.

2578
02:39:49,723 --> 02:39:50,694
LIAM: That's pretty cool.

2579
02:39:50,694 --> 02:39:52,203
LAURA: Fabulous.

2580
02:39:52,203 --> 02:39:57,246
TALIESIN: Is the money that you're paying us with
your father's money as well? Please be honest.

2581
02:39:57,246 --> 02:39:58,167
SAM: Yes, absolutely.

2582
02:39:58,167 --> 02:39:59,117
TALIESIN: That's fabulous.

2583
02:39:59,117 --> 02:40:00,218
LAURA: Oh, I like that.

2584
02:40:00,218 --> 02:40:04,258
TALIESIN: That makes everything even better.
We'll get you a room right next to the library so

2585
02:40:04,258 --> 02:40:06,148
you can have easy access.

2586
02:40:06,148 --> 02:40:07,551
SAM: Thank you.

2587
02:40:07,551 --> 02:40:09,186
TALIESIN: We can set that up right away.

2588
02:40:09,186 --> 02:40:10,641
SAM: Thank you.

2589
02:40:10,641 --> 02:40:16,801
TRAVIS: The doors don't lock, though, so you have
to be on guard all night long. Training is a

2590
02:40:16,801 --> 02:40:18,969
24-hour regimen around here.

2591
02:40:18,969 --> 02:40:22,300
SAM: All right. I accept your conditions.

2592
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:24,192
TALIESIN: I'll give you access to the workshop if
you feel like

2593
02:40:24,192 --> 02:40:25,916
building yourself a lock. Feel free.

2594
02:40:25,916 --> 02:40:27,005
SAM: You have a workshop?

2595
02:40:27,005 --> 02:40:27,678
TALIESIN: Oh, my.

2596
02:40:27,678 --> 02:40:28,480
SAM: For tinkering?

2597
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:29,400
TALIESIN: Oh, my.

2598
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:31,937
SAM: Ooh, I like you.

2599
02:40:31,937 --> 02:40:35,806
TALIESIN: Yes, it's my pleasure. It's so nice.
Of course, you'll have a tour.

2600
02:40:35,806 --> 02:40:37,429
In the morning, we'll do a brief tour.

2601
02:40:37,429 --> 02:40:40,766
SAM: Absolutely. And I could show you the inner
workings of Doty.

2602
02:40:40,766 --> 02:40:42,278
TALIESIN: I would be so delighted.

2603
02:40:42,278 --> 02:40:44,477
SAM: It's pretty outstanding if I do say so
myself.

2604
02:40:44,477 --> 02:40:45,904
TALIESIN: It's very good work, I'm very
impressed.

2605
02:40:45,904 --> 02:40:47,349
SAM: Little bit of luck, little bit of magic.

2606
02:40:47,349 --> 02:40:49,334
MARISHA: Do you want us to excuse the two of you?

2607
02:40:49,334 --> 02:40:51,058
MATT: The two of them, as you guys are having this
conversation,

2608
02:40:51,058 --> 02:40:54,241
without realizing it, slowly exit together.

2609
02:40:54,241 --> 02:40:56,004
TALIESIN: I'm not leaving.

2610
02:40:56,004 --> 02:40:57,708
MATT: Right, then you stop yourself as you reach
the door.

2611
02:40:57,708 --> 02:41:00,780
TALIESIN: I'm gonna send him to the library at the
very least.

2612
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:07,231
MATT: Okay, the waitstaff come in and retrieve
your belongings and lead you up to the chamber

2613
02:41:07,231 --> 02:41:08,661
that'll be prepared for your evening.

2614
02:41:08,661 --> 02:41:10,971
SAM: Good evening. Bye.

2615
02:41:10,971 --> 02:41:11,889
LAURA: Bidet.

2616
02:41:11,889 --> 02:41:16,482
LIAM: Good night, Tary, good night. Oh, boy.
What a babe in the woods.

2617
02:41:16,482 --> 02:41:17,977
TALIESIN: I kind of like him.

2618
02:41:17,977 --> 02:41:20,748
LAURA: Grog, how ragey are you right now?

2619
02:41:20,748 --> 02:41:22,055
TRAVIS: Pretty ragey, yeah.

2620
02:41:22,055 --> 02:41:23,027
LAURA: Super ragey?

2621
02:41:23,027 --> 02:41:23,828
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2622
02:41:23,828 --> 02:41:25,880
MARISHA: All the people who tend not to like
people are liking him.

2623
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:29,082
TALIESIN: It's a terrible sign, isn't it? Just
really, really disturbing.

2624
02:41:29,082 --> 02:41:32,044
MARISHA: I feel like the two of you never like the
same person.

2625
02:41:32,044 --> 02:41:33,431
TALIESIN: No, that's weird.

2626
02:41:33,431 --> 02:41:37,786
LIAM: You know, we don't have the weight of the
world crushing us at the moment, so I feel like

2627
02:41:37,786 --> 02:41:39,398
that might have something to do with it, yeah.

2628
02:41:39,398 --> 02:41:40,881
LAURA: It feels very strange for you two to be
agreeing.

2629
02:41:40,881 --> 02:41:47,229
TALIESIN: It does. It makes me want to take risks.
It's nice.

2630
02:41:47,229 --> 02:41:49,445
MARISHA: I thought we were taking a break from
risk-taking for a second.

2631
02:41:49,445 --> 02:41:51,121
TALIESIN: No, I feel like we've been playing it
very safe,

2632
02:41:51,121 --> 02:41:54,575
it's just been that the world has been 
taking risks.

2633
02:41:54,575 --> 02:41:57,505
MARISHA: I love the way you frame things, Percy.

2634
02:41:57,505 --> 02:41:59,582
LIAM: Once again you're a couple steps ahead of
us.

2635
02:41:59,582 --> 02:42:03,024
MARISHA: I love the way you lawyer your way out of
every situation.

2636
02:42:03,024 --> 02:42:07,669
TALIESIN: That's so nice.

2637
02:42:07,669 --> 02:42:11,382
LIAM: I wonder where Scanlan is.

2638
02:42:11,382 --> 02:42:14,374
MARISHA: I could check in on him. Haven't used the
scrying eye today.

2639
02:42:14,374 --> 02:42:18,275
TALIESIN: I wanna say let's give him some privacy,
but

2640
02:42:18,275 --> 02:42:21,324
at the same time I do kind of want to see him.

2641
02:42:21,324 --> 02:42:22,966
LAURA: I just want to know if he's all right.

2642
02:42:22,966 --> 02:42:25,181
TRAVIS: I don't.

2643
02:42:25,181 --> 02:42:27,159
MARISHA: I'm gonna look. I take out the scrying
eye.

2644
02:42:27,159 --> 02:42:28,320
TRAVIS: Don't.

2645
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:29,803
MARISHA: What? Why?

2646
02:42:29,803 --> 02:42:33,544
LIAM: I walk over to Grog and start playing-- what
was it? Rock, paper, what was it?

2647
02:42:33,544 --> 02:42:36,294
MARISHA: Boulder, parchment, shears.

2648
02:42:36,294 --> 02:42:37,718
TALIESIN: Paper, shears or parchment, shears?

2649
02:42:37,718 --> 02:42:39,284
SAM and LAURA: It should be parchment, shears.

2650
02:42:39,284 --> 02:42:41,990
LIAM: Trying to teach Grog that game.

2651
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:43,007
TRAVIS: No. Stop.

2652
02:42:43,007 --> 02:42:43,820
LIAM: No?

2653
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:45,263
TRAVIS: I don't want you to look in on him.

2654
02:42:45,263 --> 02:42:46,315
TALIESIN: I think I'm done for the evening.

2655
02:42:46,315 --> 02:42:48,281
MARISHA: Why? We just want to make sure he's
okay.

2656
02:42:48,281 --> 02:42:52,880
TRAVIS: Because he asked us for his own time.
Can we respect that or not? Or did you want him

2657
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:55,326
to yell at you more when we see him again?

2658
02:42:55,326 --> 02:42:57,413
MARISHA: He can't know if I'm scrying on him.

2659
02:42:57,413 --> 02:42:58,897
TALIESIN: He might know if you're scrying on him.

2660
02:42:58,897 --> 02:42:59,979
LAURA: He might know.

2661
02:42:59,979 --> 02:43:01,857
MARISHA: Not if I use my scrying eye.

2662
02:43:01,857 --> 02:43:04,252
TALIESIN: Let's give him a little bit of time.

2663
02:43:04,252 --> 02:43:05,761
MARISHA: All right.

2664
02:43:05,761 --> 02:43:08,825
TALIESIN: Thank you, Grog. That's a very fair
point.

2665
02:43:08,825 --> 02:43:12,610
TRAVIS: Okay, now I'll play.

2666
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:15,098
TALIESIN: Little elf girl?

2667
02:43:15,098 --> 02:43:17,950
LAURA: Danger-zone. I swear.

2668
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:19,408
TALIESIN: Is it a danger zone?

2669
02:43:19,408 --> 02:43:20,284
LAURA: Mm.

2670
02:43:20,284 --> 02:43:23,351
TALIESIN: Because, you know, it occurs to me,
I've never given you

2671
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:25,988
a full tour of the treasury room, have I?

2672
02:43:25,988 --> 02:43:29,310
LAURA: Um. Why, no, Percival.

2673
02:43:29,310 --> 02:43:31,500
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing the wine and I'm leaving
right now.

2674
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:34,037
SAM: You guys are gonna fuck in the treasury? Oh
my god!

2675
02:43:34,037 --> 02:43:36,739
(all laugh)

2676
02:43:36,739 --> 02:43:41,347
TALIESIN: Who has never wanted to have the full
Scrooge McDuck? For fuck's sake.

2677
02:43:41,347 --> 02:43:44,831
(all laugh)

2678
02:43:44,831 --> 02:43:56,624
LAURA: As we leave, I turn to Grog. And I think
about talking to him for just a second,

2679
02:43:56,624 --> 02:43:58,360
and then I leave the room.

2680
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:01,552
TALIESIN: I owe you for that shit. Thank you.

2681
02:44:01,552 --> 02:44:08,855
MATT: All right. As the rest of you wind down the
evening, drinking, perusing the treasury,

2682
02:44:08,855 --> 02:44:13,429
reading the various books that are at your
disposal--

2683
02:44:13,429 --> 02:44:15,676
TALIESIN: We do deposit the check at the treasury,
by the way, while we're there.

2684
02:44:15,676 --> 02:44:17,375
MATT: Yeah.

2685
02:44:17,375 --> 02:44:19,043
MARISHA: Deposit the checks.

2686
02:44:19,043 --> 02:44:22,571
MATT: You find your evening to a close.

2687
02:44:22,571 --> 02:44:24,642
MARISHA: We haven't had the night off in a while.

2688
02:44:24,642 --> 02:44:25,904
LIAM: Yeah.

2689
02:44:25,904 --> 02:44:32,792
MATT: You enjoy the time to relax a bit and take
another breath of air after this constant pressure

2690
02:44:32,792 --> 02:44:39,097
that's been pushing you. Next morning comes in as
the sun rises, you all come to consciousness,

2691
02:44:39,097 --> 02:44:44,980
rouse yourselves for breakfast, and whatever the
next day ensues. You all begin to gather in the

2692
02:44:44,980 --> 02:44:47,436
common room of the castle once more.

2693
02:44:47,436 --> 02:44:48,546
TRAVIS: We all healed up?

2694
02:44:48,546 --> 02:44:49,352
TALIESIN: All healed up.

2695
02:44:49,352 --> 02:44:50,907
MATT: Yep, all healed up.

2696
02:44:50,907 --> 02:44:58,093
TALIESIN: Airship or sea ship? This is your call.

2697
02:44:58,093 --> 02:44:59,361
TRAVIS: We've never done a sea ship.

2698
02:44:59,361 --> 02:45:03,685
LIAM: Yeah, I think we've got some-- We could go
after the dude in hell,

2699
02:45:03,685 --> 02:45:05,442
but I think we have some more time.

2700
02:45:05,442 --> 02:45:06,589
LAURA: Pike asked us not to.

2701
02:45:06,589 --> 02:45:08,371
TALIESIN: We should bring a Pike to hell.

2702
02:45:08,371 --> 02:45:09,521
MARISHA: Pike wants to go.

2703
02:45:09,521 --> 02:45:13,574
LIAM: I agree, I agree. So..

2704
02:45:13,574 --> 02:45:14,289
MARISHA: All right.

2705
02:45:14,289 --> 02:45:16,278
TRAVIS: Time to go finish your Atari.

2706
02:45:16,278 --> 02:45:20,127
(all laugh)

2707
02:45:20,127 --> 02:45:28,612
TALIESIN: We have twenty six hundred men in the
back.

2708
02:45:28,612 --> 02:45:34,798
MARISHA: All right. Do I know roughly where the
water ashari are?

2709
02:45:34,798 --> 02:45:44,898
MATT: You vaguely know that it exists somewhere in
the Ozmit Sea. Kind of south-ish from Tal'Dorei.

2710
02:45:44,898 --> 02:45:50,490
But you don't really know. Maybe a little bit of
information-gathering, or asking people who may

2711
02:45:50,490 --> 02:45:53,627
traverse that area would help you, but you don't
really know.

2712
02:45:53,627 --> 02:45:57,378
LAURA: Yeah, we can go down to the docks.
Are there docks here?

2713
02:45:57,378 --> 02:45:59,500
MARISHA: Not in Whitestone. I think we're pretty
landlocked.

2714
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:00,676
MATT: Pretty landlocked in Whitest--

2715
02:46:00,676 --> 02:46:02,559
TALIESIN: No. There is actually, technically
there's the sea to the north,

2716
02:46:02,559 --> 02:46:03,837
but that would be useless.

2717
02:46:03,837 --> 02:46:05,551
SAM: She meant the doctor's office.

2718
02:46:05,551 --> 02:46:08,680
MATT: Yeah, you have the Lucidian Ocean to the
east of you.

2719
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:09,677
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.

2720
02:46:09,677 --> 02:46:12,723
MATT: But it is a very treacherous water,
and the Shearing Channel, that is the series of

2721
02:46:12,723 --> 02:46:15,558
broken land mass between here and Wildmount,
the one that the

2722
02:46:15,558 --> 02:46:17,862
Briarwoods were brokering the
bridge for, is-- yeah.

2723
02:46:17,862 --> 02:46:19,764
TALIESIN: There's a reason we're not a poor city.

2724
02:46:19,764 --> 02:46:26,605
MARISHA: Is there like a port at the very south
end of the continent, to where we could hop a ship

2725
02:46:26,605 --> 02:46:28,393
and also do some research?

2726
02:46:28,393 --> 02:46:30,189
MATT: Uh, there's Stillben, very very far south.

2727
02:46:30,189 --> 02:46:31,054
LIAM: Ooh.

2728
02:46:31,054 --> 02:46:32,057
MARISHA: Stillben?

2729
02:46:32,057 --> 02:46:33,253
MATT: But that is still out to the Lucidian Ocean,
east.

2730
02:46:33,253 --> 02:46:35,118
The Ozmit Sea is on the western side of the
continent.

2731
02:46:35,118 --> 02:46:37,584
Emon is the closest port city to head to the Ozmit
Sea.

2732
02:46:37,584 --> 02:46:42,151
MARISHA: Oh, western. Oh you mean western.
Okay well then, hang on. If it's w-- Nope.

2733
02:46:42,151 --> 02:46:45,514
TALIESIN: Oh, I was about to say, who has the map?
You have the map. Okay.

2734
02:46:45,514 --> 02:46:47,397
LAURA: Yeah, it would be Emon.

2735
02:46:47,397 --> 02:46:49,802
MARISHA: 'Cause the Earth Ashari are on the
eastern side of the continent. Right?

2736
02:46:49,802 --> 02:46:51,126
TALIESIN: Do you have a map?

2737
02:46:51,126 --> 02:46:54,506
MATT: The Earth Ashari are kind of northern,
like mid-northern of the continent.

2738
02:46:54,506 --> 02:46:57,293
They're in the Cliffkeep Mountains.

2739
02:46:57,293 --> 02:47:00,436
TALIESIN: This is a conversation that is happening
right now. I'm so amused.

2740
02:47:00,436 --> 02:47:02,494
MATT: Yes it is.

2741
02:47:02,494 --> 02:47:04,960
TALIESIN: We're trying to remember the fake
geography--

2742
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:06,183
MARISHA: Of our fake world--

2743
02:47:06,183 --> 02:47:07,285
TALIESIN: Of our fantasy world.

2744
02:47:07,285 --> 02:47:09,648
MATT: Ask me, it's been my life for the past year.

2745
02:47:09,648 --> 02:47:12,798
Writing all this down for a book for all you guys.

2746
02:47:12,798 --> 02:47:13,649
SAM: I got it.

2747
02:47:13,649 --> 02:47:14,398
TALIESIN: All right.

2748
02:47:14,398 --> 02:47:15,159
MARISHA: So Emon is like--

2749
02:47:15,159 --> 02:47:15,944
SAM: We're up here.

2750
02:47:15,944 --> 02:47:16,937
LAURA: Yeah, Emon is the place to go to.

2751
02:47:16,937 --> 02:47:17,840
LIAM: Thanks, Matt.

2752
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:19,019
LAURA: Thanks, Matt.

2753
02:47:19,019 --> 02:47:21,181
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. We're up here. Whitestone's
here.

2754
02:47:21,181 --> 02:47:21,893
SAM: Yeah.

2755
02:47:21,893 --> 02:47:22,794
TALIESIN: And we need to be the south-west, so--

2756
02:47:22,794 --> 02:47:24,006
LIAM: We will live in the stars.

2757
02:47:24,006 --> 02:47:29,513
TALIESIN: Emon's here. Emon is the biggest port
city on the Ozmit Sea, isn't it?

2758
02:47:29,513 --> 02:47:31,170
MATT: Uh, on this continent? Yes.

2759
02:47:31,170 --> 02:47:32,443
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's--

2760
02:47:32,443 --> 02:47:33,901
MARISHA: So we might as well leave out of Emon.

2761
02:47:33,901 --> 02:47:34,916
TALIESIN: We might as well leave out of Emon.

2762
02:47:34,916 --> 02:47:38,170
MARISHA: And then I could also do some research,
because-- Is the libraries and the lyceums and

2763
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:40,721
stuff open again? Or are they just fucking
demolished?

2764
02:47:40,721 --> 02:47:42,620
MATT: You don't know. I mean, a lot of that part
of the town

2765
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:45,270
is just now being rebuilt and recovered so--

2766
02:47:45,270 --> 02:47:47,090
TALIESIN: Where's the airship by the way,
as well?

2767
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:49,853
MATT: You have not checked in on the airship.
You guys--

2768
02:47:49,853 --> 02:47:51,465
TALIESIN: When was the last time we saw them?

2769
02:47:51,465 --> 02:47:53,604
MATT: The last time you saw them was in the throes
of the battle with Thordak,

2770
02:47:53,604 --> 02:47:57,285
when they came in and
gave it a helping hand briefly.

2771
02:47:57,285 --> 02:47:58,821
LAURA: Did they come back here?

2772
02:47:58,821 --> 02:48:02,060
SAM: Just to keep up the audience: We're in Maine,
and we're trying to get to Los Angeles.

2773
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:02,761
TALIESIN and MATT: Yes.

2774
02:48:02,761 --> 02:48:05,124
TALIESIN: Well-put.

2775
02:48:05,124 --> 02:48:11,886
SAM: As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever
we're trying to go?

2776
02:48:11,886 --> 02:48:14,786
TALIESIN: It's easier to teleport if you're
already been there.

2777
02:48:14,786 --> 02:48:15,527
SAM: Ooh.

2778
02:48:15,527 --> 02:48:17,132
MARISHA: Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never
been there.

2779
02:48:17,132 --> 02:48:21,494
And the Ashari are a very reclusive
type people.

2780
02:48:21,494 --> 02:48:23,952
SAM: I've read about most people and places.

2781
02:48:23,952 --> 02:48:28,133
MARISHA: Have you read about the Water Ashari and
the Ashari people?

2782
02:48:28,133 --> 02:48:29,202
MATT: Make a history check.

2783
02:48:29,202 --> 02:48:30,802
LAURA: Ooh!

2784
02:48:30,802 --> 02:48:33,123
TALIESIN: I'm gonna join in on this history check
as well.

2785
02:48:33,123 --> 02:48:34,667
SAM: Yeah, that's a one.

2786
02:48:34,667 --> 02:48:36,626
TALIESIN: Wow.

2787
02:48:36,626 --> 02:48:40,428
SAM: Her eyes just intimidate me.

2788
02:48:40,428 --> 02:48:41,653
MARISHA: (whispering) Sam.

2789
02:48:41,653 --> 02:48:42,591
LAURA: Shame you.

2790
02:48:42,591 --> 02:48:43,849
LIAM: Shame! Shame!

2791
02:48:43,849 --> 02:48:48,188
TALIESIN: (singing) No one knows what it's like,
to be a bad man. Okay.

2792
02:48:48,188 --> 02:48:50,790
MARISHA: Do you wanna touch my antlers?

2793
02:48:50,790 --> 02:48:51,843
TALIESIN: Hey now.

2794
02:48:51,843 --> 02:48:52,782
MARISHA: Ignore that, that got weird.

2795
02:48:52,782 --> 02:48:53,749
TALIESIN: That got real weird.

2796
02:48:53,749 --> 02:48:55,730
(all laugh)

2797
02:48:55,730 --> 02:49:00,299
TALIESIN: I'm gonna join in on a terrible history
check. That is a 19.

2798
02:49:00,299 --> 02:49:02,021
It's not terrible, I just had a very high history.

2799
02:49:02,021 --> 02:49:06,448
MATT: It's not terrible, but your research hasn't
delved too deeply into the Ashari. And the Ashari

2800
02:49:06,448 --> 02:49:10,585
that you do know of are the Terra and uh,
and the Air Ashari.

2801
02:49:10,654 --> 02:49:13,598
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've only got what I read at
home.

2802
02:49:13,598 --> 02:49:15,893
MATT: There's the Terra and the Zephra. Those are
the only two you know about. Those are the only

2803
02:49:15,893 --> 02:49:19,033
two on the continent. The Vesrah you're not too
familiar with.

2804
02:49:19,033 --> 02:49:21,585
TALIESIN: Well, who else can we talk to?

2805
02:49:21,585 --> 02:49:26,114
MARISHA: I mean, I guess I could always go back to
the Earth Ashari, or the Air Ashari,

2806
02:49:26,114 --> 02:49:27,724
and talk to some of those people.

2807
02:49:27,724 --> 02:49:31,204
LAURA: Maybe somebody at the docks in Emon would
know?

2808
02:49:31,274 --> 02:49:32,826
TALIESIN: She really wants to go to the docks in
Emon.

2809
02:49:32,826 --> 02:49:34,925
LAURA: I wanna just pay off that docks comment,
really.

2810
02:49:34,925 --> 02:49:38,478
(all laugh)

2811
02:49:38,478 --> 02:49:42,080
SAM: Worth it.

2812
02:49:42,080 --> 02:49:45,175
TALIESIN: Magic.

2813
02:49:45,175 --> 02:49:48,413
MARISHA: I don't know. I guess we could go back
and talk to the Earth Ashari.

2814
02:49:48,413 --> 02:49:49,988
You guys haven't been there yet.

2815
02:49:49,988 --> 02:49:50,905
LAURA: Let's go!

2816
02:49:50,905 --> 02:49:52,990
TALIESIN: Let's go to the Earth Ashari.

2817
02:49:52,990 --> 02:49:54,109
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

2818
02:49:54,109 --> 02:49:56,566
TALIESIN: Let's collect our things. What's the
temperature like there?

2819
02:49:56,566 --> 02:49:57,657
LAURA: Ooh.

2820
02:49:57,657 --> 02:50:04,373
MARISHA: Right now, with it being the Season of-

2821
02:50:04,373 --> 02:50:07,260
TALIESIN: The witch.

2822
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:14,953
MATT: It's in essentially a heavy valley of stone
in the center of the Cliffkeep Mountain range.

2823
02:50:14,953 --> 02:50:23,398
It is far from civilization, it's maybe a few
days of heavy mountain--

2824
02:50:23,398 --> 02:50:26,329
constant hiking north of where Kraghammer is.

2825
02:50:26,329 --> 02:50:30,615
MARISHA: Oh. We'd have to hike to get there? No,
there's gotta be

2826
02:50:30,615 --> 02:50:33,650
trees that I can Tree Stride there to.

2827
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:37,802
MATT: There are a couple that aren't too far
outside of Terra that you can Tree Stride to.

2828
02:50:37,802 --> 02:50:41,123
MARISHA: We're druids, there's gotta be trees
within that camp, right? And stuff?

2829
02:50:41,123 --> 02:50:42,016
MATT: Yeah.

2830
02:50:42,016 --> 02:50:43,146
MARISHA: Like, nearby?

2831
02:50:43,146 --> 02:50:44,407
MATT: Yes, I'm saying that there are some that are
like,

2832
02:50:44,407 --> 02:50:46,263
just in the outskirts of Terra, none 
directly in it.

2833
02:50:46,263 --> 02:50:47,129
MARISHA: Okay.

2834
02:50:47,129 --> 02:50:52,136
SAM: Oh shit! Okay, no. Nothing. I had resistance
to something and I forgot to use it.

2835
02:50:52,136 --> 02:50:53,799
(all laugh)

2836
02:50:53,799 --> 02:50:55,318
TRAVIS: Resistance to a beating?

2837
02:50:55,318 --> 02:50:59,985
SAM: Yeah. Would not have helped me very much.

2838
02:50:59,985 --> 02:51:04,768
TALIESIN: Let's also say, as we're getting ready,
I'm gonna take Tary down and let him pick through

2839
02:51:04,768 --> 02:51:10,954
the tinkering room, see if he needs any tools and
upgrade anything

2840
02:51:10,954 --> 02:51:13,055
that he might need, give him a quick tour.

2841
02:51:13,055 --> 02:51:14,636
LAURA: And I wanna talk to Grog.

2842
02:51:14,636 --> 02:51:15,621
MATT: All righty.

2843
02:51:15,621 --> 02:51:17,110
SAM: (whispered) I'll take everything.

2844
02:51:17,110 --> 02:51:18,616
MATT: So as you guys are taking through the--

2845
02:51:18,616 --> 02:51:19,835
TALIESIN: Showing him the equipment.

2846
02:51:19,835 --> 02:51:21,838
MATT: You find Grog off to the side.

2847
02:51:21,903 --> 02:51:24,549
TALIESIN: Don't touch that.

2848
02:51:24,619 --> 02:51:25,975
LAURA: How are you?

2849
02:51:25,975 --> 02:51:26,536
TRAVIS: Me?

2850
02:51:26,536 --> 02:51:27,652
LAURA: Yeah!

2851
02:51:27,652 --> 02:51:29,620
TRAVIS: I'm good. I slept really well.

2852
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:32,187
LAURA: Yeah. Feeling less rage-y?

2853
02:51:32,187 --> 02:51:33,518
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2854
02:51:33,518 --> 02:51:45,605
LAURA: That's good, that's good. Okay. Hey, so...
This is difficult for me to do. Did you know that

2855
02:51:45,605 --> 02:51:51,031
Scanlan had acquired drugs?

2856
02:51:51,031 --> 02:51:53,603
TRAVIS: No?

2857
02:51:53,603 --> 02:51:54,521
LAURA: Did you?

2858
02:51:54,521 --> 02:51:56,260
TRAVIS: No.

2859
02:51:56,260 --> 02:52:02,719
LAURA: I just found this out, that he was using
drugs behind our back.

2860
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:04,721
TRAVIS: Like bad drugs?

2861
02:52:04,721 --> 02:52:06,661
LAURA: I think so, I mean, I've never tried them,
but--

2862
02:52:06,661 --> 02:52:08,825
TRAVIS: Me neither.

2863
02:52:08,825 --> 02:52:17,716
LAURA: So, I don't know, finding out secrets about
people doesn't feel good. Feeling like they've

2864
02:52:17,716 --> 02:52:27,425
broken your trust in some way, right? And being
trustworthy is very important.

2865
02:52:27,425 --> 02:52:29,726
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, I think that's very
important.

2866
02:52:29,726 --> 02:52:37,082
LAURA: Right. So. Just hold on.

2867
02:52:37,082 --> 02:52:39,367
TRAVIS: I'm not even fighting anyone right now.

2868
02:52:39,367 --> 02:52:53,145
LAURA: Ah. I pull out the deck. So, this is-- Do
you know what this is? Do you remember this?

2869
02:52:53,145 --> 02:52:58,397
TRAVIS: Where did you find one?

2870
02:52:58,397 --> 02:53:11,180
LAURA: Okay. So, Grog, I have to be honest with
you.

2871
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:23,435
When you asked me for this before, I lied. To you.

2872
02:53:23,435 --> 02:53:24,595
TRAVIS: You lied?

2873
02:53:24,595 --> 02:53:25,583
LAURA: Yeah.

2874
02:53:25,583 --> 02:53:26,843
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

2875
02:53:26,843 --> 02:53:32,535
LAURA: Well, I sort of tricked you and thought
it'd be funny if I gave you maybe the wrong thing.

2876
02:53:32,535 --> 02:53:38,611
To see if you'd notice! But-- I'm still lying.
I didn't-- I was afraid--

2877
02:53:38,611 --> 02:53:42,989
I gave you a false deck.

2878
02:53:42,989 --> 02:53:45,144
TRAVIS: No, no, you gave it to me, it's in my
bag.

2879
02:53:45,144 --> 02:53:46,844
LAURA: You wanna pull it out?

2880
02:53:46,844 --> 02:53:48,412
TRAVIS: But you said I wasn't supposed to look at
it.

2881
02:53:48,412 --> 02:53:53,112
LAURA: Well, you're still not supposed to,
technically. Do you want me to pull it out?

2882
02:53:53,112 --> 02:53:54,355
TRAVIS: Phrasing.

2883
02:53:54,355 --> 02:54:00,335
(all laugh)

2884
02:54:00,335 --> 02:54:02,366
LAURA: Should I-- Should you-- Do you just--

2885
02:54:02,366 --> 02:54:03,744
TRAVIS: You want me to get the deck out?

2886
02:54:03,744 --> 02:54:06,369
LAURA: Yeah, maybe close your eyes and get the
deck out.

2887
02:54:06,369 --> 02:54:09,148
(all laugh)

2888
02:54:09,148 --> 02:54:10,239
TRAVIS: All right, I got it.

2889
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:12,618
LAURA: All right, I am taking it from your hand.

2890
02:54:12,618 --> 02:54:13,831
TRAVIS: But these are mine!

2891
02:54:13,831 --> 02:54:14,574
LAURA: These ones are--

2892
02:54:14,574 --> 02:54:16,236
TRAVIS: Don't take them from me again!

2893
02:54:16,236 --> 02:54:25,515
LAURA: Grog! Open your eyes. It's not really a
deck, you see? It's a bag. With rocks in it.

2894
02:54:25,515 --> 02:54:27,117
TRAVIS: Did you take my salt lick rock?

2895
02:54:27,117 --> 02:54:31,925
LAURA: No. You gave that to Scanlan. Here's your
deck. Still don't use it, still don't look at it,

2896
02:54:31,925 --> 02:54:37,356
it's still very dangerous! But I want you to know
that I trust you with it.

2897
02:54:37,356 --> 02:54:39,345
TRAVIS: I know. You said, "Don't look at it," 
and I haven't looked at it.

2898
02:54:39,345 --> 02:54:42,915
LAURA: Oh, good, then still don't, how about
that?

2899
02:54:42,915 --> 02:54:44,001
TRAVIS: I'm very confused.

2900
02:54:44,001 --> 02:54:45,151
(all laugh)

2901
02:54:45,151 --> 02:54:46,237
LAURA: I know, basically, I just--

2902
02:54:46,237 --> 02:54:47,406
TRAVIS: Do you want a card?

2903
02:54:47,406 --> 02:54:48,359
LAURA: No! I don't know.

2904
02:54:48,359 --> 02:54:49,175
TRAVIS: I open the flap--

2905
02:54:49,175 --> 02:54:50,721
LAURA: No no no! Don't-- Grog!

2906
02:54:50,721 --> 02:54:53,305
TRAVIS: Do you want a card? What're you worried
about, it's a deck of cards.

2907
02:54:53,305 --> 02:55:00,702
LAURA: You're making me regret giving this back to
you right now. I just want to say. I close it.

2908
02:55:00,702 --> 02:55:02,247
Please don't make me regret this.

2909
02:55:02,247 --> 02:55:04,017
TRAVIS: Why?

2910
02:55:04,017 --> 02:55:10,619
LAURA: I'm sorry that I lied to you. Even though
you didn't notice. I want you to know you can

2911
02:55:10,619 --> 02:55:14,174
still trust me, and I can still trust you to not
fuck with this.

2912
02:55:14,174 --> 02:55:16,131
TRAVIS: I would like to insight check Vex.

2913
02:55:16,131 --> 02:55:17,260
MATT: Make an insight check.

2914
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:20,040
LIAM: (laughing) I love you guys.

2915
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:22,283
TRAVIS: Six.

2916
02:55:22,283 --> 02:55:27,713
(all laugh)

2917
02:55:27,713 --> 02:55:32,849
MATT: It's a lot of words. It's a lot of words.
But you got your deck back.

2918
02:55:32,849 --> 02:55:34,823
TRAVIS: But I always had it.

2919
02:55:34,823 --> 02:55:39,824
MATT: You-- It's really confusing. She's talking
at you, but nothing changed.

2920
02:55:39,824 --> 02:55:42,888
TRAVIS: Is this a lesson?

2921
02:55:42,888 --> 02:55:47,984
LAURA: Sure.

2922
02:55:47,984 --> 02:55:51,575
TRAVIS: Can we just skip to the part where you get
so frustrated that I haven't got it and you just

2923
02:55:51,575 --> 02:55:54,306
tell me the answer anyway?

2924
02:55:54,306 --> 02:55:55,171
LAURA: Grog?

2925
02:55:55,171 --> 02:55:57,513
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2926
02:55:57,513 --> 02:56:02,643
LAURA: You're a good person. Still don't look at
the deck.

2927
02:56:02,643 --> 02:56:11,907
I'm glad you have our back. Don't do drugs.

2928
02:56:11,907 --> 02:56:15,006
TRAVIS: What do you think Scanlan did with the
rest of those drugs?

2929
02:56:15,006 --> 02:56:16,523
LAURA: What do you mean 'the rest of the drugs'?

2930
02:56:16,523 --> 02:56:18,243
TRAVIS: Well, you said he was doing drugs, right?

2931
02:56:18,243 --> 02:56:18,938
LAURA: Right.

2932
02:56:18,938 --> 02:56:21,345
TRAVIS: Well, did he just take them with him?

2933
02:56:21,345 --> 02:56:23,188
LAURA: Should we search his room?

2934
02:56:23,188 --> 02:56:26,727
TRAVIS: Ooh, maybe!

2935
02:56:26,727 --> 02:56:27,688
LAURA: Let's do it.

2936
02:56:27,688 --> 02:56:29,089
TRAVIS: All right, I put the deck away.

2937
02:56:29,089 --> 02:56:30,861
MATT: Okay. You guys head up to Scanlan's room.

2938
02:56:30,861 --> 02:56:31,652
LAURA: Yeah.

2939
02:56:31,652 --> 02:56:33,206
MATT: Both you guys make investigation checks.

2940
02:56:33,206 --> 02:56:34,496
LIAM: You've done a lot of brilliant things.

2941
02:56:34,496 --> 02:56:37,213
That was the most brilliant thing you have ever
done.

2942
02:56:37,213 --> 02:56:40,015
TALIESIN: I am so consistently proud of you.

2943
02:56:40,015 --> 02:56:41,234
LIAM: Oh my god.

2944
02:56:41,234 --> 02:56:42,830
TRAVIS: 16. 18 minus two.

2945
02:56:42,830 --> 02:56:44,587
LAURA: Oh! 16 for me as well.

2946
02:56:44,587 --> 02:56:46,503
TRAVIS and LAURA: Hey!

2947
02:56:46,503 --> 02:56:50,500
MATT: Together you both see-- You both spend the
better part of an hour thumbing through the

2948
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:56,875
various drawers and odd boxes and sundries that
were left behind in the wake of Scanlan's

2949
02:56:56,875 --> 02:57:00,256
departure. And at the same time you both come to
find that,

2950
02:57:00,256 --> 02:57:03,648
no, there are-- no illegal substances remain.

2951
02:57:03,648 --> 02:57:04,762
LAURA: He took them with him!

2952
02:57:04,762 --> 02:57:05,892
TRAVIS: What about nudey pictures?

2953
02:57:05,892 --> 02:57:06,881
LAURA: Oh, nudey pictures.

2954
02:57:06,881 --> 02:57:08,962
TALIESIN: Other things, what else is in the room?

2955
02:57:08,962 --> 02:57:13,175
MATT: Honestly? There are no nudey pictures,
per se.

2956
02:57:13,175 --> 02:57:14,286
TRAVIS: Boring.

2957
02:57:14,286 --> 02:57:19,586
MATT: You do find a series of books on art and the
human physique.

2958
02:57:19,586 --> 02:57:20,449
TRAVIS: Ugh.

2959
02:57:20,449 --> 02:57:22,803
MATT: And all the corresponding images have been
torn out.

2960
02:57:22,803 --> 02:57:24,838
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

2961
02:57:24,838 --> 02:57:25,892
TRAVIS: Damn it.

2962
02:57:25,892 --> 02:57:30,336
SAM: I have magic that can make things that are
way more real than a drawing.

2963
02:57:30,336 --> 02:57:35,374
TALIESIN: He has three original print issues of
Cherry Comics number one through four.

2964
02:57:35,374 --> 02:57:36,672
TRAVIS: Well, there's no drugs.

2965
02:57:36,672 --> 02:57:39,396
LAURA: Well, I guess he took them with him.

2966
02:57:39,396 --> 02:57:44,656
TRAVIS: All right. When do I get to look at the
cards?

2967
02:57:44,656 --> 02:57:45,894
LAURA: Like, never, Grog.

2968
02:57:45,894 --> 02:57:51,713
TRAVIS: Like, never never? Never, never?

2969
02:57:51,713 --> 02:57:58,318
LAURA: Well, I heard from Percival that they're
super, super dangerous.

2970
02:57:58,318 --> 02:57:59,924
But I don't know what they do.

2971
02:57:59,924 --> 02:58:01,056
TRAVIS: Yeah, you don't.

2972
02:58:01,056 --> 02:58:03,312
LAURA: No, I don't.

2973
02:58:03,312 --> 02:58:05,816
TRAVIS: Only one way to find out! Not today.

2974
02:58:05,816 --> 02:58:07,678
LAURA: Not today, how about that?

2975
02:58:07,678 --> 02:58:08,975
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2976
02:58:08,975 --> 02:58:10,129
LAURA: All right.

2977
02:58:10,129 --> 02:58:16,759
MATT: All right. You've joined the rest of the
party, the rest of-- After you guys finish your

2978
02:58:16,759 --> 02:58:24,451
perusal of the workshop, which is quite a
workshop, mundane in a lot of ways, but functional

2979
02:58:24,451 --> 02:58:26,788
for the basic purposes of tinkering.

2980
02:58:26,788 --> 02:58:27,669
TALIESIN: Rustic!

2981
02:58:27,669 --> 02:58:29,775
MATT and TALIESIN: Rustic.

2982
02:58:29,775 --> 02:58:32,926
SAM: I think it's magnificent, what you've put
together here.

2983
02:58:32,926 --> 02:58:33,844
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2984
02:58:33,844 --> 02:58:40,080
SAM: And I'm impressed, and from me that's quite a
compliment.

2985
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:43,021
TALIESIN: No, I'm feeling it. And, my workshop,
obviously, is your workshop for as long as you

2986
02:58:43,021 --> 02:58:47,087
stay here. Anything you need to work on,
of course, it's fully available.

2987
02:58:47,087 --> 02:58:52,417
SAM: You know what? I don't normally do this,
but... What's your name?

2988
02:58:52,417 --> 02:58:55,286
(all laugh)

2989
02:58:55,286 --> 02:58:58,917
MARISHA: Oh my god. He doesn't know any of our
names!

2990
02:58:58,917 --> 02:59:01,571
LAURA: Oh my god!

2991
02:59:01,571 --> 02:59:04,884
MARISHA: We're like a bad speed dating session.
Holy shit.

2992
02:59:04,884 --> 02:59:08,841
TALIESIN: This is so amazing. Percival
Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski

2993
02:59:08,841 --> 02:59:11,269
de Rolo the third. At your service.

2994
02:59:11,269 --> 02:59:12,941
MARISHA: Oooh! He's still got it!

2995
02:59:12,941 --> 02:59:15,807
SAM: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski
de Rolo the third. All right.

2996
02:59:15,807 --> 02:59:18,470
TALIESIN: Percy to my friends.

2997
02:59:18,470 --> 02:59:19,552
SAM: I'm Tary to mine.

2998
02:59:19,552 --> 02:59:25,104
TALIESIN: Tary, it's a pleasure. This is the
castle I live in, this is my sister's castle,

2999
02:59:25,104 --> 02:59:28,799
except of course, she's lovely.
Cassandra de Rolo.

3000
02:59:28,799 --> 02:59:29,767
SAM: Hm.

3001
02:59:29,767 --> 02:59:32,966
TALIESIN: You are in Whitestone, as our guest.

3002
02:59:32,966 --> 02:59:36,905
SAM: It is my honor and privilege to be your
guest, sir.

3003
02:59:36,905 --> 02:59:40,697
TALIESIN: A pleasure. I recommend eventually,
not necessarily today 'cause I am actually

3004
02:59:40,697 --> 02:59:43,511
enjoying it, learning everyone else's name as
well.

3005
02:59:43,511 --> 02:59:44,921
SAM: All right, well. Okay.

3006
02:59:44,921 --> 02:59:54,330
(all laugh)

3007
02:59:54,330 --> 02:59:57,172
SAM: Let's Tary-on! No? Maybe?

3008
02:59:57,172 --> 02:59:58,918
TALIESIN: No it's-- I'm okay with it, I'm rolling
with it.

3009
02:59:58,918 --> 03:00:00,180
MARISHA: No! No.

3010
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:01,192
SAM: Doty! Doty, put it as a maybe.

3011
03:00:01,192 --> 03:00:02,346
MARISHA: Not becoming a catchphrase.

3012
03:00:02,346 --> 03:00:03,544
TALIESIN: It's not a catchphrase.

3013
03:00:03,544 --> 03:00:06,957
SAM: Doty, put it as a maybe for catchphrases.

3014
03:00:06,957 --> 03:00:08,388
MATT: You guys gather up--

3015
03:00:08,388 --> 03:00:09,940
TALIESIN: Another daring rescue.

3016
03:00:09,940 --> 03:00:13,506
MATT: Together, prepare yourselves for what the
next step of your journey is. What are you doing?

3017
03:00:13,506 --> 03:00:14,891
MARISHA: Are we going? Are we going?

3018
03:00:14,891 --> 03:00:15,487
LAURA: Yeah.

3019
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:17,064
MARISHA: Going, going, gone, gotta go?

3020
03:00:17,064 --> 03:00:19,203
TALIESIN: Got your stuff together? Everything you
need?

3021
03:00:19,203 --> 03:00:21,045
LAURA: Are we going to Emon? No. We're going to
the earth-- the earth people.

3022
03:00:21,045 --> 03:00:22,001
MARISHA: Got everything. Earth people first.

3023
03:00:22,001 --> 03:00:22,837
MATT: Okay.

3024
03:00:22,837 --> 03:00:25,701
MARISHA: So we can be like, where do I find the
other fourth of my tribe.

3025
03:00:25,701 --> 03:00:28,709
TALIESIN: You've written your camp number.
In pen, on your arm.

3026
03:00:28,709 --> 03:00:31,427
MARISHA: Yes, I've got my safety tags.

3027
03:00:31,427 --> 03:00:32,453
TALIESIN: You've got your safety tags.

3028
03:00:32,453 --> 03:00:33,568
MARISHA: I'm good. I'm good.

3029
03:00:33,568 --> 03:00:35,782
TALIESIN: You've got your rights written on the
back, so that, y'know. If anyone tries to--

3030
03:00:35,782 --> 03:00:36,656
MARISHA: Yes.

3031
03:00:36,656 --> 03:00:38,716
LIAM: Let's do it, let's--

3032
03:00:38,716 --> 03:00:40,584
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

3033
03:00:40,584 --> 03:00:41,262
MATT: All right.

3034
03:00:41,262 --> 03:00:43,199
MARISHA: Respect. Respect the antlers.

3035
03:00:43,199 --> 03:00:45,154
LIAM: Always have.

3036
03:00:45,154 --> 03:00:47,424
TALIESIN: We decorated them at the last winter
festival.

3037
03:00:47,424 --> 03:00:48,775
MARISHA: I like decorating my antlers.

3038
03:00:48,775 --> 03:00:50,067
TALIESIN: And it looked quite nice.

3039
03:00:50,067 --> 03:00:52,840
MARISHA: It's a traditional Ashari tradition.

3040
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:53,900
LIAM: All right. Eyes on the prize.

3041
03:00:53,900 --> 03:00:54,843
LAURA: Let's go!

3042
03:00:54,843 --> 03:00:59,052
MATT: (laughs) You guys find your way to the Sun
Tree. Utilizing Transport via Plants you find

3043
03:00:59,052 --> 03:01:04,386
yourself (teleportation sound) thrust through the
trunk of the Sun Tree, and emerging on the

3044
03:01:04,441 --> 03:01:10,054
opposite side, on the cusp of a deep bowl-like
valley that goes probably for a good mile and a

3045
03:01:10,054 --> 03:01:15,086
half, or two miles across, before you reach the
other side of this crest.

3046
03:01:15,086 --> 03:01:18,182
LIAM: Tary! That's two times! You've teleported
two times.

3047
03:01:18,182 --> 03:01:23,536
SAM: (gasps) Oh my god, every time it's amazing.
Wow, thank you. Thank you all.

3048
03:01:23,536 --> 03:01:26,447
Where are we?

3049
03:01:26,447 --> 03:01:28,397
TALIESIN: Uh.

3050
03:01:28,397 --> 03:01:29,284
MARISHA: Well.

3051
03:01:29,284 --> 03:01:30,199
MATT: Central Cliffkeep.

3052
03:01:30,199 --> 03:01:31,730
MARISHA: We are in the central Cliffkeep

3053
03:01:31,730 --> 03:01:33,065
SAM: Of?

3054
03:01:33,065 --> 03:01:37,399
MARISHA: Of Tal'Dorei. And of the central-- Of the
Cliffkeep Mountains.

3055
03:01:37,399 --> 03:01:38,717
SAM: So cool.

3056
03:01:38,717 --> 03:01:39,432
MARISHA: Yeah!

3057
03:01:39,432 --> 03:01:44,079
(all laugh)

3058
03:01:44,079 --> 03:01:51,539
MATT: You glance around, and there are the edges
of a forest here. A lot of them are stockier

3059
03:01:51,539 --> 03:01:57,716
trees, and things that live in harsh environments,
and a lot of them are rooted in cracks in the

3060
03:01:57,716 --> 03:02:05,086
ground, and portions of the rock that have split
open. Down within this valley, you can already see

3061
03:02:05,086 --> 03:02:12,129
what appear to be dozens and dozens of trenches,
that seem to have been dug. And there are areas

3062
03:02:12,211 --> 03:02:16,957
of this valley that appear to have eroded or
collapsed.

3063
03:02:16,957 --> 03:02:23,838
Like small, long rockslides that are just kind of
dotting the edges of the mountain walls.

3064
03:02:23,838 --> 03:02:30,844
Down towards the center you can see, also,
a cluster of dozens and dozens of small abodes,

3065
03:02:30,844 --> 03:02:37,360
it looks like. Homes, huts, structures made of
rock. This is Terra, this is the Earth Ashari

3066
03:02:37,360 --> 03:02:45,198
village here. Currently guarding over the
localized rift to the Earth Elemental plane.

3067
03:02:45,198 --> 03:02:47,989
You guys are traversing down into it?

3068
03:02:47,989 --> 03:02:50,434
MARISHA: Yep

3069
03:02:50,434 --> 03:02:54,126
MATT: It takes you a short time, you find one of
the paths that kinda zigzags down the side of this

3070
03:02:54,126 --> 03:03:00,944
mountain drop, and make your way in towards the
center. The sun is now-- I'd say at this time,

3071
03:03:00,944 --> 03:03:07,837
just over the very top, kind of noon-ish portion
of the day. You begin to walk your way in and it's

3072
03:03:07,837 --> 03:03:13,649
very warm here, partially because the-- It's
northern enough where usually it's a colder

3073
03:03:13,649 --> 03:03:16,699
temperature on the island-- Don't you even,
you motherfucker.

3074
03:03:16,699 --> 03:03:20,686
LIAM: Wow. You lasered in on that like nobody's
business!

3075
03:03:20,686 --> 03:03:21,729
TRAVIS: (gunshots)

3076
03:03:21,729 --> 03:03:23,312
MATT: I'm a little sensitive

3077
03:03:23,508 --> 03:03:27,155
(all laugh)

3078
03:03:27,155 --> 03:03:31,411
MATT: But the further down you get it is just--
The tree line has stopped and it is just rock,

3079
03:03:31,411 --> 03:03:35,625
stone, that is reflecting the light and it is
warm. You're starting to find yourself sweat in

3080
03:03:35,625 --> 03:03:41,217
your full armor as you traverse deeper and deeper
into the center of this mountain valley.

3081
03:03:41,271 --> 03:03:43,479
MARISHA: It's always like 20 degrees warmer in the
valley.

3082
03:03:43,479 --> 03:03:48,341
LAURA: (laughs) Terrible.

3083
03:03:48,341 --> 03:03:49,738
MATT: Disadvantage on the next roll.

3084
03:03:49,738 --> 03:03:51,046
(all laugh)

3085
03:03:51,046 --> 03:03:52,805
TALIESIN: Thank you for turning us into an episode
of California, yes.

3086
03:03:52,805 --> 03:03:56,078
LIAM: That's a little bit of Los Angeles actor
humor for you guys over in Sweden today.

3087
03:03:56,078 --> 03:03:59,110
TRAVIS: (surfer accent) Californians.

3088
03:03:59,110 --> 03:04:01,792
TALIESIN: To get to Critical Role, take the 101
with the 5

3089
03:04:01,792 --> 03:04:03,981
to get up to Burbank to get to Critical Role.

3090
03:04:03,981 --> 03:04:07,572
LIAM: For all you fans in Germany, that's a little
San Fernando valley humor!

3091
03:04:07,572 --> 03:04:10,495
TALIESIN: From beautiful downtown Burbank.

3092
03:04:10,495 --> 03:04:12,499
SAM: I loved it, you can do no wrong.

3093
03:04:12,499 --> 03:04:14,489
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3094
03:04:14,489 --> 03:04:15,354
MATT: Exactly.

3095
03:04:15,354 --> 03:04:17,042
MARISHA: I like Tary.

3096
03:04:17,042 --> 03:04:21,358
MATT: Yeah. So as you continue downward,
you get maybe a quarter-mile into this walk,

3097
03:04:21,358 --> 03:04:27,515
still relatively far from the village, before--
And you recognize this. You watch as one of the

3098
03:04:27,515 --> 03:04:33,030
nearby trenches, (earth moving) shifts up
about two feet in stone, and you watch as three

3099
03:04:33,094 --> 03:04:36,447
figures step out from within the trench and begin
walking towards you.

3100
03:04:36,447 --> 03:04:37,564
TRAVIS: Are we killing these?

3101
03:04:37,564 --> 03:04:39,939
MARISHA: Stop-- No, no? These are-- Grog!

3102
03:04:39,939 --> 03:04:40,860
TRAVIS: Sorry, but--

3103
03:04:40,860 --> 03:04:42,214
TALIESIN: They're sending us to the things we're
going to kill.

3104
03:04:42,214 --> 03:04:44,626
TRAVIS: Oh! Okay.

3105
03:04:44,626 --> 03:04:48,791
MARISHA: Everyone, wait for a second. I step
forward a second.

3106
03:04:48,791 --> 03:04:54,123
MATT: Okay. You watch as three humanoids
approach.

3107
03:04:54,123 --> 03:04:55,821
TRAVIS: Lambchop-looking motherfucker.

3108
03:04:55,821 --> 03:04:57,827
SAM: Just a stick. Just a stick. It doesn't do
anything.

3109
03:04:57,827 --> 03:04:59,744
TALIESIN: It's from the walking company.

3110
03:04:59,744 --> 03:05:03,845
MATT: They are clad in darkened leathers, furs,

3111
03:05:03,845 --> 03:05:07,141
and it looks like a lot of the armor and garb 
here is taken from

3112
03:05:07,141 --> 03:05:13,808
hunted creatures and animals that have been
prepared and tanned, here within the sun-wracked

3113
03:05:13,808 --> 03:05:19,500
center of this mountain valley. The two to the--
Flanking the central figure appear to be human,

3114
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:26,794
male and female, both very short, kind of tossed
hair. Then at the center you see what appears to

3115
03:05:26,794 --> 03:05:36,281
be a surprisingly short, but very stocky and
thick, half orc female. As she approaches she

3116
03:05:36,281 --> 03:05:43,456
has-- the hair is woven back into these thick
braids that are pulled into a singular, what looks

3117
03:05:43,456 --> 03:05:48,093
like a topknot, on the upper back of her skull.
Her jaw protrudes a bit, you can see the two

3118
03:05:48,093 --> 03:05:51,544
lower fangs kinda pushing past the lips.

3119
03:05:51,544 --> 03:05:52,909
MARISHA: Is this Patisse?

3120
03:05:52,909 --> 03:05:54,572
MATT: No, this is--

3121
03:05:54,572 --> 03:05:56,152
TRAVIS: Lower fangs?

3122
03:05:56,152 --> 03:05:57,507
LAURA: She's a half orc.

3123
03:05:57,507 --> 03:05:58,601
LIAM: Yeah, she's got the big teeth.

3124
03:05:58,601 --> 03:05:59,862
MATT: This is Rockcaller Dryden.

3125
03:05:59,862 --> 03:06:00,849
LAURA: Rockcaller--?

3126
03:06:00,849 --> 03:06:01,946
MATT: Dryden.

3127
03:06:01,946 --> 03:06:03,910
LAURA: Not that I would know that.

3128
03:06:03,910 --> 03:06:05,604
LIAM: (sing-song) Rock Caller Dryden

3129
03:06:05,604 --> 03:06:07,553
SAM: Good old RCD.

3130
03:06:07,553 --> 03:06:08,977
MARISHA: Do I know Dryden from before?

3131
03:06:08,977 --> 03:06:09,744
MATT: You do.

3132
03:06:09,744 --> 03:06:11,055
MARISHA: All right.

3133
03:06:11,055 --> 03:06:12,452
MATT: This is not the headmaster of the tribe,

3134
03:06:12,452 --> 03:06:13,204
MARISHA: Right.

3135
03:06:13,204 --> 03:06:15,594
MATT: But one of the central sentinels that's
around this portion here.

3136
03:06:15,655 --> 03:06:17,575
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3137
03:06:17,575 --> 03:06:21,614
MATT: Approaches you, and for a moment puts a hand
out almost to hail you,

3138
03:06:21,614 --> 03:06:24,378
and then recognizes your face and steps forward.

3139
03:06:24,378 --> 03:06:27,766
"Keyleth? What brings you to Terra?"

3140
03:06:27,766 --> 03:06:29,480
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, Dryden.

3141
03:06:29,480 --> 03:06:30,469
MATT: Kaitiaki.

3142
03:06:30,469 --> 03:06:31,864
MARISHA: How are you?

3143
03:06:31,864 --> 03:06:32,661
MATT: We are well.

3144
03:06:32,661 --> 03:06:35,578
MARISHA: Have you fared well here recently,
in the past several months?

3145
03:06:35,578 --> 03:06:38,081
MATT: We have hunkered down. Our business was to
make sure

3146
03:06:38,081 --> 03:06:42,052
that no more of the Rifts befall the
same fate of the Pyrah.

3147
03:06:42,052 --> 03:06:44,699
MARISHA: Have you talked to Cerkonos or Korren at
all?

3148
03:06:44,699 --> 03:06:46,355
MATT: Not recently, no.

3149
03:06:46,355 --> 03:06:50,964
MARISHA: We have slayed the Chroma Conclave.
All the dragons are dead.

3150
03:06:50,964 --> 03:06:52,885
MATT: Then this is a time for celebration.

3151
03:06:52,885 --> 03:06:54,062
MARISHA: Yes.

3152
03:06:54,062 --> 03:06:55,591
MATT: I will pass this along.

3153
03:06:55,591 --> 03:06:58,901
MARISHA: I was wondering if I could speak to
Headmaster Patisse.

3154
03:06:58,901 --> 03:07:04,175
MATT: Perhaps, but what do you wish to speak on?

3155
03:07:04,175 --> 03:07:09,882
MARISHA: I am intent on continuing my journey on
to the Water Ashari tribe.

3156
03:07:09,882 --> 03:07:13,641
And I need information from him.

3157
03:07:13,641 --> 03:07:20,922
MATT: To the Vesrah. Very well. I could help you
with this information if need be.

3158
03:07:20,922 --> 03:07:25,836
MARISHA: Is Patisse indisposed?

3159
03:07:25,836 --> 03:07:28,848
MATT: No. No, right this way.

3160
03:07:28,848 --> 03:07:32,829
MARISHA: I mean it would just be nice to, like,
say hi. While I'm here at least.

3161
03:07:32,829 --> 03:07:41,742
MATT: "Very well." They turn around and begin to
lead you back towards the outskirts of the city,

3162
03:07:41,742 --> 03:07:45,262
not directly into Terra itself, but as you
approach, and walk past, you can see the ground

3163
03:07:45,262 --> 03:07:54,650
here-- every ten minutes or so you feel a sudden
shift, and a slight quake beneath your feet.

3164
03:07:54,704 --> 03:07:58,411
The landscape here, the closer you walk to the
center of the village, seems to be in this

3165
03:07:58,411 --> 03:08:02,896
perpetual state of shifting rock. And you watch as
different areas kind of collide.

3166
03:08:02,896 --> 03:08:06,773
Areas of stone kind of (cracking noise),
and rocks tumble down. Parts of it break and

3167
03:08:06,773 --> 03:08:12,242
crack and reform. At one point, as you guys are
not maybe 200 feet out from the first major

3168
03:08:12,242 --> 03:08:17,649
structures, the ground has one major spike.
(loud rock slide) And you hear this heavy rolling

3169
03:08:17,649 --> 03:08:26,701
rumble, and you watch as, maybe 300 feet off from
the side, a new pinnacle is formed. Two big plates

3170
03:08:26,701 --> 03:08:31,769
kind of (crack), jut upward, one kind of coasting
over the other and coming to a halt. There is very

3171
03:08:31,769 --> 03:08:37,109
heavy localized seismic activity as part of the
proximity to the rift of the earth elemental plane

3172
03:08:37,109 --> 03:08:42,442
here. And you watch as three druids come rushing
out of the side of the Terra tribe, and as they

3173
03:08:42,442 --> 03:08:49,469
focus, the rocks (crumbling noises) crumble back
down and subside. The central mountain landscape,

3174
03:08:49,469 --> 03:08:53,788
here, brought back to a momentary beat of peace
and quiet.

3175
03:08:53,788 --> 03:08:55,551
MARISHA: I'm like a New Yorker on a subway.

3176
03:08:55,551 --> 03:08:56,409
MATT: Yeah. Just going straight in.

3177
03:08:56,409 --> 03:08:58,064
MARISHA: I'm just like, whatever. Used to this.

3178
03:08:58,064 --> 03:08:59,938
LAURA: Must wreak havoc on the local
architexture.

3179
03:08:59,938 --> 03:09:01,007
TRAVIS: Architexture?

3180
03:09:01,007 --> 03:09:02,754
LAURA: Architexture.

3181
03:09:02,754 --> 03:09:05,479
MARISHA: Oh, it's built-- We've got infrastructure
built for that sort of thing.

3182
03:09:05,479 --> 03:09:10,738
It's fine, they're used to it here.

3183
03:09:10,738 --> 03:09:14,695
MATT: Right. As you progress inward, and some of
the other Terra Ashari--

3184
03:09:14,695 --> 03:09:18,755
LAURA: Shut your mouth, you wouldn't even know
what architecture is!

3185
03:09:18,755 --> 03:09:26,334
MATT: Different visual representations. Some
appear to be more ornamental. Jewelry seems to be

3186
03:09:26,334 --> 03:09:33,562
here, like jewels and metallics used, it seems to
connote a level of prestige within the tribe,

3187
03:09:33,562 --> 03:09:38,419
and every individual that walks, usually with a
cluster or protectors around them, or at least,

3188
03:09:38,419 --> 03:09:44,214
seems to be in a place of notable importance
within groups, seems to be more adorned in this

3189
03:09:44,214 --> 03:09:52,405
natural-based jewelry. You know exactly where to
go to head straight to the hut

3190
03:09:52,405 --> 03:09:54,333
in which the headmaster resides and as--

3191
03:09:54,333 --> 03:09:59,741
LIAM: And I'm watching her stride through here
with confidence, just impressed.

3192
03:09:59,741 --> 03:10:09,407
MARISHA: Rockcaller. Rockcaller. Oh Jerry! How you
been? How's the kids?

3193
03:10:09,407 --> 03:10:10,981
LIAM: Jerry! Jerry!

3194
03:10:10,981 --> 03:10:14,318
MARISHA: Jerry! JERRY!

3195
03:10:14,318 --> 03:10:19,273
MATT: What looks to be a heavy wooden doorway,
built out of a series of tree trunks that are

3196
03:10:19,273 --> 03:10:24,458
strapped to this one area. Just (tree trunks
shifting) shifts open and now you see, walks a

3197
03:10:24,458 --> 03:10:37,526
very tall, thin, and older, like mid-60s human
male, who is adorned in a similar tattoo pattern

3198
03:10:37,579 --> 03:10:42,581
as the Rockcaller you saw earlier. But it seems to
reside from the center of the cheeks and through

3199
03:10:42,581 --> 03:10:46,601
the jowls and then crosses across the neck and
then

3200
03:10:46,601 --> 03:10:50,091
across the arms all the way down to the 
fingertips.

3201
03:10:50,091 --> 03:10:51,177
LAURA: (quietly) Tight.

3202
03:10:51,177 --> 03:10:54,193
MATT: And there are certain portions which are
broken up by hard lines, it's like this parallel

3203
03:10:54,193 --> 03:11:01,696
intersection multiple times as the tattoo
progresses down. Very, very loose, almost a

3204
03:11:01,696 --> 03:11:10,673
flowing central shoulder-based robe that tosses
down the front of the body and meets with a long

3205
03:11:10,673 --> 03:11:15,755
skirt that drags behind him as he steps out.
And as he looks over in the direction of you,

3206
03:11:15,755 --> 03:11:24,487
you can see the eyes are very hardened, dark,
deep brown in color, and the sockets are very

3207
03:11:24,487 --> 03:11:29,954
weathered, his skin texture in general is pretty
weathered. He looks over towards you,

3208
03:11:29,954 --> 03:11:35,998
clean-shaven, short white hair, puts a hand up.

3209
03:11:35,998 --> 03:11:43,239
"Keyleth, you grace the Terra with your presence.
What can we be of service to you for?"

3210
03:11:43,239 --> 03:11:48,277
MARISHA: I stand more in attention, more formal.

3211
03:11:48,277 --> 03:11:51,423
Good to see you, Patisse, it's been quite some 
time.

3212
03:11:51,423 --> 03:11:53,478
MATT: You as well.

3213
03:11:53,478 --> 03:12:00,495
MARISHA: I just came to check in after the recent
events in the world, make sure everyone was okay.

3214
03:12:00,495 --> 03:12:10,789
MATT: Everything seems to be fine. We've been
intent of care to the rift, and from the word that

3215
03:12:10,789 --> 03:12:15,807
seems to have passed quickly since your arrival
over the past few days, it's come to our attention

3216
03:12:15,807 --> 03:12:21,272
that Thordak no longer sits in the center of the
city of Emon.

3217
03:12:21,272 --> 03:12:27,238
MARISHA: That's correct. We've also slain his
right-hand man, Raishan, who seemed to be the

3218
03:12:27,238 --> 03:12:29,826
mastermind of the entire orchestration.

3219
03:12:29,826 --> 03:12:34,111
MATT: Good. Good and well done.

3220
03:12:34,111 --> 03:12:37,533
MARISHA: Thank you. I couldn't have done it
without your help and training,

3221
03:12:37,533 --> 03:12:41,003
so I appreciate that.

3222
03:12:41,003 --> 03:12:46,520
MATT: You are but a seed, you allowed it to
germinate. So what do you need?

3223
03:12:46,520 --> 03:12:55,211
MARISHA: Well, I'm intent on continuing on with my
Aramente now that there's relative peace in the

3224
03:12:55,279 --> 03:13:04,057
world. The Vesrah people are quite insular,
of course. I was wondering if you could give me

3225
03:13:04,057 --> 03:13:08,387
some advice on how to get there and any advice in
general on dealing with them?

3226
03:13:08,387 --> 03:13:17,040
MATT: It has been a long time since I've attended
any sort of gathering with the Vesrah. It is for

3227
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:25,464
people of our skill set not the easiest of
journeys, as many of us are capable of traversing

3228
03:13:25,464 --> 03:13:30,844
through the sentinels of nature. Unfortunately,
most of the tree life

3229
03:13:30,844 --> 03:13:34,141
that exists around Vesrah is beneath the water.

3230
03:13:34,141 --> 03:13:35,622
MARISHA: Right.

3231
03:13:35,622 --> 03:13:44,697
MATT: So your most likely form of transport will
be that of a vessel across the waves.

3232
03:13:44,697 --> 03:13:49,949
MARISHA: Who's their headmaster there now? Do you
know?

3233
03:13:49,949 --> 03:13:57,740
MATT: The headmaster there-- Uvenda, the heart of
the tides.

3234
03:13:57,740 --> 03:13:59,613
MARISHA: Uvenda.

3235
03:13:59,613 --> 03:14:01,144
MATT: Uvenda.

3236
03:14:01,144 --> 03:14:14,723
MARISHA: Uvenda, the heart of the tides.
What can I expect of this Uvenda? Uvenda.

3237
03:14:14,723 --> 03:14:22,288
MATT: Not what you'd expect. I'll leave it at
that.

3238
03:14:22,288 --> 03:14:25,293
MARISHA: That's very vague of you, Patisse.

3239
03:14:25,293 --> 03:14:32,343
MATT: Well, what would be the fun if I were to
unveil the next fold of your Aramente?

3240
03:14:32,343 --> 03:14:41,399
MARISHA: No, you've got a point. Do you recommend
by ship or would flight be more appropriate?

3241
03:14:41,399 --> 03:14:44,468
MATT: If you have the means, that is up to you.

3242
03:14:44,468 --> 03:14:51,144
MARISHA: All right. Any other words of
encouragement?

3243
03:14:51,144 --> 03:15:07,378
MATT: Listen closely. Keep your friends about you.
That should be sufficient.

3244
03:15:07,378 --> 03:15:14,431
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, I probably should've
introduced-- by the way, this is my band I've been

3245
03:15:14,431 --> 03:15:20,459
traveling with, Vox Machina. And Tary. Tary
Darrington.

3246
03:15:20,459 --> 03:15:23,707
SAM: Lovely to meet you. I have no idea where we
are right now.

3247
03:15:23,707 --> 03:15:26,580
MATT: Good, keep it that way.

3248
03:15:26,580 --> 03:15:29,985
MARISHA: He's new.

3249
03:15:29,985 --> 03:15:33,518
LAURA: Can I ask a question? Is that all right?

3250
03:15:33,518 --> 03:15:34,554
MARISHA: Of course.

3251
03:15:34,554 --> 03:15:35,598
LAURA: Is it polite?

3252
03:15:35,598 --> 03:15:36,634
MARISHA: Yeah.

3253
03:15:36,634 --> 03:15:43,093
LAURA: (quietly) Hi, sorry. You mentioned that the
water Ashari live under the water.

3254
03:15:43,093 --> 03:15:45,775
MATT: They don't live beneath the water,
not entirely.

3255
03:15:45,775 --> 03:15:50,042
LAURA: Okay, I thought maybe they were like
mer-people or something, I wasn't sure.

3256
03:15:50,042 --> 03:15:51,517
MARISHA: That would be awesome.

3257
03:15:51,517 --> 03:15:52,826
LAURA: Yeah, right? That'd be really cool.

3258
03:15:52,826 --> 03:15:53,824
MARISHA: Yeah.

3259
03:15:53,824 --> 03:15:55,807
LAURA: Cool. So we'll see them above land then if
we're flying.

3260
03:15:55,807 --> 03:15:58,301
MATT: Some of them, yes.

3261
03:15:58,301 --> 03:16:07,171
LAURA: Some of them. All right, that was my
question. Thank you for your answer. Thank you.

3262
03:16:07,242 --> 03:16:11,935
MARISHA: Are there any other landmarks or ways of
navigation to find them?

3263
03:16:11,935 --> 03:16:14,679
They're an island in the middle of the Ozmit sea.

3264
03:16:14,679 --> 03:16:23,485
MATT: It's not the island of usual appearance.
The beaches and sands of Vesrah are built upon a

3265
03:16:23,485 --> 03:16:31,508
great circular reef. And part of the city lies
above, part of it lies below.

3266
03:16:31,508 --> 03:16:33,806
TRAVIS: (quietly) Sick.

3267
03:16:33,806 --> 03:16:36,288
MARISHA: (quietly) Awesome.

3268
03:16:36,288 --> 03:16:40,077
MATT: Look for the white sands beneath the
surface. Some structures will be visible from

3269
03:16:40,077 --> 03:16:59,441
above. It would lie quite a ways to the southwest,
not too far from the Hespit. I would recommend

3270
03:16:59,441 --> 03:17:06,541
perhaps procuring the service of someone who knows
the sea well.

3271
03:17:06,541 --> 03:17:14,883
MARISHA: Yes. We were going to look into trying to
do that. Well, is there anything you need from me,

3272
03:17:14,883 --> 03:17:17,486
Patisse, before we head on?

3273
03:17:17,486 --> 03:17:30,032
MATT: No. Just do your best to have your friends
keep the location of our village to themselves.

3274
03:17:30,032 --> 03:17:36,209
MARISHA: Don't worry, we have many places we'd
prefer to keep this way.

3275
03:17:36,209 --> 03:17:45,039
MATT: Good. I trust you all. Safe journeys.
Keep her safe.

3276
03:17:45,039 --> 03:17:46,138
TALIESIN: Of course.

3277
03:17:46,138 --> 03:17:47,804
LAURA: Always.

3278
03:17:47,804 --> 03:17:53,258
MATT: The tempest needs a new voice.

3279
03:17:53,258 --> 03:17:58,767
MARISHA: Thank you for your belief in me.
Kaitiaki, Patisse.

3280
03:17:58,767 --> 03:18:01,888
MATT: Kaitiaki, young Keyleth.

3281
03:18:01,888 --> 03:18:03,162
SAM: You're welcome.

3282
03:18:03,162 --> 03:18:04,947
LAURA: Kai... tiaki.

3283
03:18:04,947 --> 03:18:05,817
MARISHA: (quietly) Good job.

3284
03:18:05,817 --> 03:18:07,111
TALIESIN: Kaitiaki.

3285
03:18:07,111 --> 03:18:12,428
(all laugh)

3286
03:18:12,497 --> 03:18:14,070
SAM: Kaiahoga.

3287
03:18:14,070 --> 03:18:15,266
MARISHA: What did you say?

3288
03:18:15,266 --> 03:18:16,486
LAURA: Kamehameha.

3289
03:18:16,486 --> 03:18:18,946
LIAM: Ticonderoga... pencils.

3290
03:18:18,946 --> 03:18:23,314
SAM: I pull Vax aside and say--

3291
03:18:23,314 --> 03:18:26,429
LIAM: What's up, buddy?

3292
03:18:26,429 --> 03:18:33,121
SAM: Poise, grace, confidence, she is amazing.

3293
03:18:33,121 --> 03:18:35,221
LIAM: Yeah? That's true.

3294
03:18:35,221 --> 03:18:40,101
SAM: Is she your leader?

3295
03:18:40,101 --> 03:18:42,558
LIAM: Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes.

3296
03:18:42,558 --> 03:18:43,739
SAM: (quietly) Incredible.

3297
03:18:43,739 --> 03:18:44,767
LIAM: Yeah.

3298
03:18:44,767 --> 03:18:46,510
SAM: I'm learning so much already, thank you
again.

3299
03:18:46,510 --> 03:18:54,487
LIAM: That's-- you're welcome, that's good.
That's good. One step at a time.

3300
03:18:54,487 --> 03:18:55,516
SAM: Absolutely.

3301
03:18:55,516 --> 03:18:56,577
LIAM: Yeah.

3302
03:18:56,577 --> 03:19:00,619
TRAVIS: Vax, you made sure Tary partook of some of
the soil here, right?

3303
03:19:00,619 --> 03:19:02,891
It's an Ashari tradition, right?

3304
03:19:02,891 --> 03:19:04,887
LIAM: What? Are you asking me if he shit here?
What are you talking about?

3305
03:19:04,887 --> 03:19:07,125
TRAVIS: No, no. He has to eat-- did you? Tary,
did you manage

3306
03:19:07,125 --> 03:19:09,991
to get some of the soil in your mouth?

3307
03:19:09,991 --> 03:19:11,037
SAM: The what in my mouth?

3308
03:19:11,037 --> 03:19:14,936
TRAVIS: It's a custom here you have to eat the
dirt of the earth Ashari.

3309
03:19:14,936 --> 03:19:17,393
LIAM: I walk off. I'm not getting part of this.

3310
03:19:17,393 --> 03:19:18,494
SAM: Absolutely. I will do it.

3311
03:19:18,494 --> 03:19:20,046
TRAVIS: You don't want to be offensive.

3312
03:19:20,046 --> 03:19:21,634
SAM: You're absolutely right.

3313
03:19:21,634 --> 03:19:23,694
TRAVIS: Yeah. Custom is important.

3314
03:19:23,694 --> 03:19:28,995
SAM: Mm-hm. Following the local customs,
I took a handful of dirt

3315
03:19:28,995 --> 03:19:30,821
and shoved it down my fucking throat.

3316
03:19:30,821 --> 03:19:32,631
(all laugh)

3317
03:19:32,631 --> 03:19:35,380
MATT: (coughs) You go into an immediate coughing
fit as the--

3318
03:19:35,380 --> 03:19:37,768
SAM: (coughs)

3319
03:19:37,768 --> 03:19:42,346
MATT: -- the surface dirt here is built from
constant colliding of stone and rock, and a lot of

3320
03:19:42,346 --> 03:19:45,236
it has been ground to almost a fine powder in
places--

3321
03:19:45,236 --> 03:19:46,602
LIAM: Have some volcanic ash.

3322
03:19:46,602 --> 03:19:50,798
MATT: -- yeah, yeah. It's akin to the cinnamon
challenge in a way.

3323
03:19:50,798 --> 03:19:53,062
(all laugh)

3324
03:19:53,062 --> 03:19:57,312
SAM: (coughs)

3325
03:19:57,312 --> 03:19:59,182
TRAVIS: Just stay with it, the first time's the
worst.

3326
03:19:59,182 --> 03:20:01,221
Don't dilute it with any water or anything.

3327
03:20:01,221 --> 03:20:06,527
TALIESIN: Just thinking, it's like diatomaceous
earth. Just hateful.

3328
03:20:06,527 --> 03:20:10,538
TRAVIS: You're toughening up already.

3329
03:20:10,538 --> 03:20:11,538
SAM: Thank you.

3330
03:20:11,538 --> 03:20:12,849
TRAVIS: Ooh, your voice sounds deeper.

3331
03:20:12,849 --> 03:20:17,590
SAM: Yeah, that is my vocal cords
being covered in dirt.

3332
03:20:17,590 --> 03:20:18,735
TRAVIS: I like this.

3333
03:20:18,735 --> 03:20:20,199
LAURA: Why are your vocal cords covered in
dirt?

3334
03:20:20,199 --> 03:20:22,778
SAM: I just ate dirt.

3335
03:20:22,778 --> 03:20:24,840
LAURA: Why on earth would you eat dirt?

3336
03:20:24,840 --> 03:20:29,173
SAM: I'll go into my satchel and pull out some 
healing draught,

3337
03:20:29,173 --> 03:20:34,359
and just-- ah, just take a big gulp.

3338
03:20:34,359 --> 03:20:35,252
MATT: Okay.

3339
03:20:35,252 --> 03:20:36,120
SAM: Okay.

3340
03:20:36,120 --> 03:20:37,648
MATT: It feels much better.

3341
03:20:37,648 --> 03:20:40,959
SAM: Much better. Shall we?

3342
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:42,682
TALIESIN: Yes, let's.

3343
03:20:42,682 --> 03:20:45,787
LIAM: Kiki, what do you think? Are we staying
here for the night, or-- I mean, we just got here,

3344
03:20:45,787 --> 03:20:47,676
it's the middle of the day, isn't it?

3345
03:20:47,676 --> 03:20:49,185
LAURA: Can we Treestride again today?

3346
03:20:49,185 --> 03:20:50,283
MARISHA: Yeah, we can.

3347
03:20:50,283 --> 03:20:54,092
LIAM: We need to make camp? You need to
rest? Or can we go now?

3348
03:20:54,092 --> 03:20:57,371
MARISHA: I'm good. After this we'll probably
have-- No, I'm good. I mean--

3349
03:20:57,371 --> 03:20:59,165
TALIESIN: We Treestride, we get a ship,
and then--

3350
03:20:59,165 --> 03:21:00,386
MARISHA: And then I'll be resting.

3351
03:21:00,386 --> 03:21:01,526
TALIESIN: -- we spend a night on the
ship.

3352
03:21:01,526 --> 03:21:02,391
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

3353
03:21:02,391 --> 03:21:02,999
TRAVIS: I like it.

3354
03:21:02,999 --> 03:21:03,920
TALIESIN: Isn't that gonna be fun?

3355
03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:04,552
LAURA: Yeah.

3356
03:21:04,552 --> 03:21:06,698
TALIESIN: I haven't been on a ship si-- Oh
my, yeah.

3357
03:21:06,698 --> 03:21:09,259
MARISHA: Are we gonna do the airship, or-- no, I 
guess we left the airship in Whitestone.

3358
03:21:09,259 --> 03:21:11,507
TALIESIN: Well, we-- technically, we--

3359
03:21:11,507 --> 03:21:12,617
MARISHA: Or did we leave it in Emon?

3360
03:21:12,617 --> 03:21:13,784
TALIESIN: We left it in Emon.

3361
03:21:13,784 --> 03:21:14,460
MATT: Emon.

3362
03:21:14,460 --> 03:21:15,463
LAURA: Yeah.

3363
03:21:15,463 --> 03:21:17,789
MARISHA: Hopefully, it's-- you know, let's see 
if it's still intact.

3364
03:21:17,789 --> 03:21:20,056
TRAVIS: What's wrong with a boat? We
haven't been on a boat.

3365
03:21:20,056 --> 03:21:20,830
MARISHA: That's true.

3366
03:21:20,830 --> 03:21:22,140
TALIESIN: I'm kind of feeling the
boat.

3367
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:22,846
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

3368
03:21:22,846 --> 03:21:24,212
MARISHA: You guys wanna go on a boat?

3369
03:21:24,212 --> 03:21:25,577
LIAM: You are feeling the boat over the airship?

3370
03:21:25,577 --> 03:21:30,029
TALIESIN: I haven't been on a boat in a long time,
and I'm feeling a little weird about an airship.

3371
03:21:30,029 --> 03:21:30,720
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3372
03:21:30,720 --> 03:21:34,389
LIAM: I know, but you practically sang ballads
for airships for weeks.

3373
03:21:34,389 --> 03:21:35,080
TALIESIN: I know.

3374
03:21:35,080 --> 03:21:36,050
LAURA: Yeah, and we got one.

3375
03:21:36,050 --> 03:21:36,916
TALIESIN: We did-- we could--

3376
03:21:36,916 --> 03:21:37,956
TRAVIS: He tap-dances on boats.

3377
03:21:37,956 --> 03:21:39,274
TALIESIN: I mean, I wouldn't object to it,
I just--

3378
03:21:39,274 --> 03:21:40,434
LIAM: So one and done, all right.

3379
03:21:40,434 --> 03:21:41,311
MARISHA: Wait, does this mean--

3380
03:21:41,311 --> 03:21:42,359
LAURA: We can be regular pirates now.

3381
03:21:42,359 --> 03:21:46,598
MARISHA: Does this mean we can get yacht gear if
we go on a boat-- or pirate gear?

3382
03:21:46,598 --> 03:21:47,278
LIAM: I'm on a boat!

3383
03:21:47,278 --> 03:21:48,139
TALIESIN: I'm not getting the proper
shoes.

3384
03:21:48,139 --> 03:21:48,800
LAURA: (gasps) Pirate gear!

3385
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:49,500
MARISHA: Pirate gear!

3386
03:21:49,500 --> 03:21:51,247
SAM: Boat shoes? I own boat shoes.

3387
03:21:51,247 --> 03:21:52,624
TALIESIN: I knew you would.

3388
03:21:52,624 --> 03:21:53,380
LIAM: What does that mean?

3389
03:21:53,380 --> 03:21:54,459
TRAVIS: You do?

3390
03:21:54,459 --> 03:21:58,022
SAM: They're great, they're flat-soled, 
they are white, and--

3391
03:21:58,022 --> 03:21:58,895
LIAM: White.

3392
03:21:58,895 --> 03:22:00,239
TALIESIN: They are.

3393
03:22:00,239 --> 03:22:01,130
SAM: Yes, they are--

3394
03:22:01,130 --> 03:22:02,603
MARISHA: You mean like Keds? You're talking
about Keds?

3395
03:22:02,603 --> 03:22:03,688
TALIESIN: No, no, they're boating shoes.

3396
03:22:03,688 --> 03:22:04,465
SAM: Boat shoes.

3397
03:22:04,465 --> 03:22:05,491
MARISHA: Boat shoes. (laughs)

3398
03:22:05,491 --> 03:22:06,832
TALIESIN: They're actually boating shoes. I am 
embarrassed that I know

3399
03:22:06,832 --> 03:22:08,857
exactly what you're talking about.

3400
03:22:08,857 --> 03:22:09,761
SAM: Of course.

3401
03:22:09,761 --> 03:22:12,265
LIAM: Your boating shoes, I'm sure, are very 
white.

3402
03:22:12,265 --> 03:22:13,753
SAM: Yes, they are.

3403
03:22:13,753 --> 03:22:14,635
TRAVIS: What are they made of, leather?

3404
03:22:14,635 --> 03:22:15,778
SAM: With little leather stripes--

3405
03:22:15,778 --> 03:22:16,635
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're made of leather.

3406
03:22:16,635 --> 03:22:17,393
SAM: Yeah.

3407
03:22:17,393 --> 03:22:18,689
LIAM: Yes.

3408
03:22:18,689 --> 03:22:21,278
SAM: And a little sailor's cap.

3409
03:22:21,278 --> 03:22:21,963
LAURA: No.

3410
03:22:21,963 --> 03:22:24,086
LIAM: Ooh, no.

3411
03:22:24,086 --> 03:22:25,710
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

3412
03:22:25,710 --> 03:22:26,994
SAM: I have a navigator's kit.

3413
03:22:26,994 --> 03:22:29,528
MATT: He does, it's--

3414
03:22:29,528 --> 03:22:33,593
(all laugh)

3415
03:22:33,593 --> 03:22:34,342
MATT: He does.

3416
03:22:34,342 --> 03:22:35,582
SAM: Let's set sail!

3417
03:22:35,582 --> 03:22:36,521
MATT: Yeah!

3418
03:22:36,521 --> 03:22:38,082
SAM: A sextant and everything.

3419
03:22:38,082 --> 03:22:41,738
TALIESIN: That is-- that is my
favorite phrase in the English language,

3420
03:22:41,812 --> 03:22:43,438
is "I have a kit for that."

3421
03:22:43,438 --> 03:22:44,713
MARISHA: I have a kit for that. (laughs)

3422
03:22:44,713 --> 03:22:46,760
TALIESIN: You have just come upon it.

3423
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:48,507
MATT: I'm so excited that worked out.

3424
03:22:48,507 --> 03:22:50,343
LIAM: What is going on?

3425
03:22:50,343 --> 03:22:51,613
MATT: All right. So--

3426
03:22:51,613 --> 03:22:52,692
MARISHA: Well, that's fun.

3427
03:22:52,692 --> 03:22:56,426
MATT: You find your way back to the edge 
of the valley,

3428
03:22:56,426 --> 03:23:01,141
to the same tree that you made your Transport via
Plants through--

3429
03:23:01,141 --> 03:23:04,303
MARISHA: I do the touristy thing to 'em again on
the way out, like I do.

3430
03:23:04,303 --> 03:23:08,513
MATT: Pointing out. What is your destination
tree?

3431
03:23:08,513 --> 03:23:13,546
MARISHA: (stammers)

3432
03:23:13,546 --> 03:23:14,457
TALIESIN: Pine.

3433
03:23:14,457 --> 03:23:17,356
MARISHA: Our keep. Greyskull Keep. Garden. Tree.

3434
03:23:17,356 --> 03:23:18,139
MATT: Okay.

3435
03:23:18,139 --> 03:23:20,063
MARISHA: Sorry. That just took a while 
to find in my brain.

3436
03:23:20,063 --> 03:23:21,853
LAURA: I imagine you saying all that as you touch
the tree.

3437
03:23:21,853 --> 03:23:24,202
MARISHA: (stammers) It's been a long few weeks.

3438
03:23:24,202 --> 03:23:25,311
TRAVIS: The channel just--

3439
03:23:25,311 --> 03:23:29,609
MARISHA: Only the best, only the best.

3440
03:23:29,609 --> 03:23:34,830
MATT: You transport from the outskirts of Terra,
find your way back to Greyskull Keep, and walking

3441
03:23:34,830 --> 03:23:42,162
towards Emon proper. You can see now, even from
the distance as you approach, the walls, some of

3442
03:23:42,162 --> 03:23:46,912
the larger buildings, the higher towers and 
structures that just barely peek over the wall,

3443
03:23:46,912 --> 03:23:49,703
you can see are already in the process of
repair. You can see--

3444
03:23:49,703 --> 03:23:50,837
LAURA: Wow, that was fast.

3445
03:23:50,837 --> 03:23:54,483
MATT: -- teams of people that are in-- currently
trying to rebuild and restructure as you enter

3446
03:23:54,483 --> 03:23:59,744
from the southern gates of the city and enter the
streets, it's more lively than you've ever seen it.

3447
03:23:59,744 --> 03:24:02,578
People are returning. People are coming back and
reclaiming what remains of their homesteads,

3448
03:24:02,578 --> 03:24:05,053
many of them still intact without a problem.

3449
03:24:05,053 --> 03:24:07,649
The damage was
extensive, but not universal in the city,

3450
03:24:07,649 --> 03:24:13,136
and so I'd say there's still a good 60% to 70% of
the city that is mostly without damage, and there

3451
03:24:13,136 --> 03:24:21,109
are areas that are just destroyed, but even those,
people are picking up, reclaiming-- There appears

3452
03:24:21,109 --> 03:24:27,591
to be a process of memorial being constructed on
the outskirts of the Cloudtop to remember those

3453
03:24:27,591 --> 03:24:34,028
who fell in the battle for Emon. There is also the
skyport, which was on the outskirts of the

3454
03:24:34,028 --> 03:24:40,000
Cloudtop, and up there you can see the skyship
Deera,

3455
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:42,912
however it looks to have sustained a severe 
amount of damage--

3456
03:24:42,912 --> 03:24:43,886
LIAM: Damn it!

3457
03:24:43,886 --> 03:24:46,364
MATT: -- in the battle, and is in the 
process of also receiving its own repairs.

3458
03:24:46,364 --> 03:24:47,394
LIAM: Son of a bitch.

3459
03:24:47,394 --> 03:24:48,911
LAURA: Oh, I hope Captain Damon's all right.

3460
03:24:48,911 --> 03:24:49,585
MARISHA: Yeah.

3461
03:24:49,585 --> 03:24:53,501
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

3462
03:24:53,501 --> 03:24:54,384
LAURA: He's so dreamy.

3463
03:24:54,384 --> 03:24:55,362
TRAVIS: Heartthrob Damon.

3464
03:24:55,362 --> 03:24:57,004
TALIESIN: He's just gotten a little scar.

3465
03:24:57,004 --> 03:24:59,265
MATT: There you go.

3466
03:24:59,265 --> 03:25:00,359
LAURA: The perfect scar.

3467
03:25:00,359 --> 03:25:01,071
TALIESIN: Yes.

3468
03:25:01,071 --> 03:25:02,270
MATT: Now he's dangerous Damon.

3469
03:25:02,270 --> 03:25:03,298
MARISHA: Cap Damon.

3470
03:25:03,298 --> 03:25:04,711
LAURA: He's got the-- no, he's got the
Harrison Ford.

3471
03:25:04,711 --> 03:25:06,275
TALIESIN: Is this the Harrison Ford, or is it the 
scar right below the cheek

3472
03:25:06,275 --> 03:25:08,750
so that when he cries it hits the scar
and goes down.

3473
03:25:08,750 --> 03:25:10,757
MARISHA: Oh yeah, and it trickles down.

3474
03:25:10,757 --> 03:25:12,762
LIAM: I mean either way, he can make it
work, right?

3475
03:25:12,762 --> 03:25:13,835
LAURA: Yeah.

3476
03:25:13,835 --> 03:25:15,519
MATT: Yeah. All right, so what are you guys doing?

3477
03:25:15,519 --> 03:25:16,691
TALIESIN: It's like a little pachinko machine 
of pain.

3478
03:25:16,691 --> 03:25:18,914
TRAVIS: Run the canal, run the canal.

3479
03:25:18,914 --> 03:25:20,779
LIAM: Don't leave me hanging up top. Woo!

3480
03:25:20,779 --> 03:25:21,723
LAURA: That was a good one.

3481
03:25:21,723 --> 03:25:24,634
MARISHA: Pike's here, right? She's in the city.

3482
03:25:24,634 --> 03:25:29,272
MATT: Pike is in the city somewhere, you haven't 
found her, you don't know where she is.

3483
03:25:29,272 --> 03:25:33,264
MARISHA: 'Cause I imagine she would have good
recommendations on good crews--

3484
03:25:33,264 --> 03:25:34,161
LIAM: Boats.

3485
03:25:34,161 --> 03:25:35,026
MARISHA: -- and boats.

3486
03:25:35,026 --> 03:25:35,977
TALIESIN: Ooh.

3487
03:25:35,977 --> 03:25:37,292
MARISHA: So, let's try and find Pike.

3488
03:25:37,292 --> 03:25:40,371
TRAVIS: Didn't she just say a good crew?
She just said to find a good crew.

3489
03:25:40,371 --> 03:25:42,036
LAURA: Find a good crew.

3490
03:25:42,036 --> 03:25:43,814
TALIESIN: She wouldn't maybe not know,
necessarily.

3491
03:25:43,814 --> 03:25:47,308
MARISHA: Would Pike know if there's
a good crew? Let's save ten minutes on finding

3492
03:25:47,308 --> 03:25:49,362
Pike. Would Pike know if there's a good
crew?

3493
03:25:49,362 --> 03:25:52,724
MATT: Pike had one crew that she travelled
with on the ocean--

3494
03:25:52,724 --> 03:25:53,765
LIAM: Seems dodgy.

3495
03:25:53,765 --> 03:25:55,772
SAM: They're all dead.

3496
03:25:55,772 --> 03:26:00,500
TALIESIN: They're not dead, they just left her.

3497
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:04,789
MATT: But that crew, I will say for the sake of 
time, is not currently docked at Emon.

3498
03:26:04,789 --> 03:26:05,635
MARISHA: Okay.

3499
03:26:05,635 --> 03:26:07,398
LIAM: She was busy doing push-ups on that cruise.

3500
03:26:07,398 --> 03:26:08,203
MATT: Yeah.

3501
03:26:08,203 --> 03:26:09,238
TALIESIN: One-handed.

3502
03:26:09,238 --> 03:26:10,865
LAURA: Let's go to the docks, you guys. Today.

3503
03:26:10,865 --> 03:26:11,718
MARISHA: To the docks!

3504
03:26:11,718 --> 03:26:13,201
MATT: You find yourself at the western docks of 
Emon.

3505
03:26:13,201 --> 03:26:14,316
LIAM: Ter the dercks!

3506
03:26:14,316 --> 03:26:15,613
MARISHA: Ter the dercks!

3507
03:26:15,613 --> 03:26:17,712
TALIESIN: Ter the dercks.

3508
03:26:17,712 --> 03:26:23,323
MATT: You hear the familiar sound of seagulls
and other water-based fowl,

3509
03:26:23,323 --> 03:26:26,865
mixed with the creaking of wood from 
large ships that are all

3510
03:26:26,865 --> 03:26:34,170
making their way in and out of this rather large
port here on the side of the Ozmit Sea. You can

3511
03:26:34,170 --> 03:26:38,640
see there's a lot of goods coming into the city
now, as a lot of heavy orders have come from

3512
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:45,230
nearby villages to transport goods as part of the
recovery, both from the south from the Mornset as

3513
03:26:45,230 --> 03:26:50,950
well as things that were too large to carry by
cart from Syngorn, and have been coming up along

3514
03:26:50,950 --> 03:26:56,701
the coast, avoiding Dagger Bay, and making their
way up to Emon. There are a number of individuals

3515
03:26:56,701 --> 03:27:02,160
around, and who would want to spearhead the
investigation--

3516
03:27:02,160 --> 03:27:03,871
MARISHA: I'm not good at investigating. Who's good
at investigating?

3517
03:27:03,871 --> 03:27:04,725
LAURA: I'll go.

3518
03:27:04,725 --> 03:27:05,896
LIAM: Yeah.

3519
03:27:05,896 --> 03:27:07,035
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

3520
03:27:07,035 --> 03:27:09,943
LIAM: I'll back you up. Me too, me too.

3521
03:27:09,943 --> 03:27:14,297
TALIESIN: Looks good.

3522
03:27:14,297 --> 03:27:16,834
LAURA: 19?

3523
03:27:16,834 --> 03:27:18,642
LIAM: 18. Oh, you've done me in by one.

3524
03:27:18,642 --> 03:27:19,941
LAURA: Oh, by one!

3525
03:27:19,941 --> 03:27:20,836
LIAM: One.

3526
03:27:20,836 --> 03:27:22,912
MATT: Asking about for a while, you eventually-- 
people point you in the

3527
03:27:22,912 --> 03:27:26,194
direction of what appears to be an individual
named Dockmaster Abban.

3528
03:27:26,194 --> 03:27:28,974
MARISHA: Dockmaster Oban?

3529
03:27:28,974 --> 03:27:29,768
LIAM: Abban.

3530
03:27:29,768 --> 03:27:31,093
MATT: Abban. A-B-B-A-N.

3531
03:27:31,093 --> 03:27:31,839
MARISHA: Abban.

3532
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:32,722
TALIESIN: Abban.

3533
03:27:32,722 --> 03:27:34,599
MARISHA: A-B-B-A-N.

3534
03:27:34,599 --> 03:27:37,857
MATT: You're eventually led to this 
individual who, pointed

3535
03:27:37,857 --> 03:27:45,383
out, is dressed simply at first glance. The
clothing he wears, just a plain white, billowing

3536
03:27:45,383 --> 03:27:54,717
shirt, nice tailored pants, and some boots that go
just up to the mid-calf. Dark brown-red skin,

3537
03:27:54,717 --> 03:28:06,922
completely shaved, smooth, bald, shining in the
sun, no facial hair, with piercing blue-grey eyes.

3538
03:28:06,922 --> 03:28:09,509
As soon as you begin to approach, he's finishing
a conversation with someone and turns to you and

3539
03:28:09,566 --> 03:28:12,189
flashes the brightest of white smiles and goes,

3540
03:28:12,189 --> 03:28:18,885
"Hello! Ah, you look like you are looking for some
help, or in aid of something, yes? No?"

3541
03:28:18,885 --> 03:28:19,530
LAURA: Yes.

3542
03:28:19,530 --> 03:28:21,000
MATT: You're staring at me. What do you want?

3543
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:24,761
LAURA: We are-- I don't know if you've noticed, 
but the city has just been saved.

3544
03:28:24,761 --> 03:28:30,168
MATT: I have noticed it, strangely enough.
I've watched it be saved, and--

3545
03:28:30,168 --> 03:28:36,072
LAURA: Yes, then you maybe saw us in the fray, and
now, after saving this beautiful city, we are on

3546
03:28:36,072 --> 03:28:42,290
our way to the middle of the fucking sea. Would
somebody be able to take us?

3547
03:28:42,290 --> 03:28:47,147
MATT: Well, are you looking for a-- to purchase a
vessel?

3548
03:28:47,147 --> 03:28:55,359
LAURA: No. To rent a crew of well-seasoned sailors
who know their way around the ocean.

3549
03:28:55,359 --> 03:29:00,440
MATT: I guess it really depends on the size of the
vessel you're taking-- what ship do you have?

3550
03:29:00,440 --> 03:29:02,336
TALIESIN: We're looking to-- I'm cutting in for
a second--

3551
03:29:02,336 --> 03:29:03,171
LAURA: Sure, darling.

3552
03:29:03,171 --> 03:29:03,900
LIAM: Sure.

3553
03:29:03,900 --> 03:29:05,290
TALIESIN: -- charter, dear, charter. You're 
looking to charter.

3554
03:29:05,290 --> 03:29:08,741
LAURA: We're looking to charter a ship.

3555
03:29:08,741 --> 03:29:09,941
MATT: Okay.

3556
03:29:09,941 --> 03:29:11,985
LAURA: I just learn so much from you, you
know?

3557
03:29:11,985 --> 03:29:13,079
TALIESIN: I-- well, this was just--

3558
03:29:13,079 --> 03:29:13,890
TRAVIS: Barf.

3559
03:29:13,890 --> 03:29:14,887
LAURA: Take over.

3560
03:29:14,887 --> 03:29:15,809
MATT: And where are you travelling?

3561
03:29:15,809 --> 03:29:16,656
TALIESIN: No, please.

3562
03:29:16,656 --> 03:29:17,699
LIAM: Ah, that's complicated.

3563
03:29:17,699 --> 03:29:24,125
LAURA: Well, just very close to Hespit,
actually, not far so-- very far southwest--

3564
03:29:24,125 --> 03:29:27,212
MATT: How close to the Hespits?

3565
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:29,808
LIAM: We're hoping for a bit of a discount for the
group

3566
03:29:29,808 --> 03:29:33,332
that is responsible for this city still existing.

3567
03:29:33,332 --> 03:29:35,114
TALIESIN: She's much better at this than you.

3568
03:29:35,114 --> 03:29:35,741
MARISHA: Oh, man.

3569
03:29:35,741 --> 03:29:37,006
LIAM: Give it a second, please.

3570
03:29:37,006 --> 03:29:37,731
TALIESIN: Okay.

3571
03:29:37,731 --> 03:29:38,650
LIAM: Doubting Thomas.

3572
03:29:38,650 --> 03:29:43,904
MATT: I have-- I apologise, I do not
follow this train of thought. Discount?

3573
03:29:43,904 --> 03:29:47,454
LIAM: (sighs) Do your fucking thing, whatever.

3574
03:29:47,454 --> 03:29:50,229
(all laugh)

3575
03:29:50,229 --> 03:29:54,434
LIAM: I didn't roll any kind of a check, I just 
got shat upon,

3576
03:29:54,434 --> 03:29:58,117
but whatever, do your thing. And I walk off.

3577
03:29:58,117 --> 03:29:59,600
TRAVIS: I just got shat upon.

3578
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:01,343
TALIESIN: I just-- I don't feel the dice were 
necessary at that point.

3579
03:30:01,343 --> 03:30:02,213
TRAVIS: (laughs) Shat upon.

3580
03:30:02,213 --> 03:30:05,373
LIAM: I do! I do! They're necessary all the time.

3581
03:30:05,373 --> 03:30:06,784
All the time! Except when it comes--

3582
03:30:06,784 --> 03:30:07,594
TRAVIS: Do I?

3583
03:30:07,594 --> 03:30:10,773
LIAM: --to me. Go, go, do your thing. Do your 
thing. I'm gone.

3584
03:30:10,773 --> 03:30:16,639
MATT: No, you-- Okay. Vax walks away before he 
finishes his point,

3585
03:30:16,639 --> 03:30:19,367
and doesn't get to make his roll.

3586
03:30:19,367 --> 03:30:19,971
LIAM: Yep.

3587
03:30:19,971 --> 03:30:20,641
MATT: Okay.

3588
03:30:20,641 --> 03:30:23,198
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, whatever, Matthew, whatever.

3589
03:30:23,198 --> 03:30:23,920
MATT: What?

3590
03:30:23,920 --> 03:30:25,724
LIAM: What roll?

3591
03:30:25,724 --> 03:30:26,602
MATT: All right.

3592
03:30:26,602 --> 03:30:29,083
SAM: We'll never know.

3593
03:30:29,083 --> 03:30:30,464
LAURA: Forgive my brother, he gets very 
embarrassed when he talks

3594
03:30:30,464 --> 03:30:36,484
about how much we've saved. Humble
creature.

3595
03:30:36,484 --> 03:30:42,176
MATT: I'm still very confused here. You're asking 
for a discount, why?

3596
03:30:42,176 --> 03:30:43,637
Because the city was saved?

3597
03:30:43,637 --> 03:30:45,705
LAURA: Oh, well I wasn't, of course not.

3598
03:30:45,705 --> 03:30:49,603
MATT: Look, I don't know who you
are,

3599
03:30:49,603 --> 03:30:51,232
I don't know what you're trying to do here--

3600
03:30:51,232 --> 03:30:52,065
TRAVIS: We killed all the dragons.

3601
03:30:52,065 --> 03:30:54,668
MATT: --but we're in the process of trying to

3602
03:30:54,668 --> 03:31:00,607
recover the economy of what was once a very strong
economy, of a town that has been under attack.

3603
03:31:00,607 --> 03:31:05,295
Now, we cannot offer discounts to anybody because
right now, we're all in financial dire straits.

3604
03:31:05,295 --> 03:31:06,271
LAURA: Understandable.

3605
03:31:06,271 --> 03:31:07,815
MATT: So, if you're going to ship, if you're going
to move,

3606
03:31:07,815 --> 03:31:10,458
if you're going to charter, if you're going to
purchase, it's going to have to be the ask--

3607
03:31:10,458 --> 03:31:14,524
LAURA: We're looking to charter a ship, full 
of sailors, who can get us to

3608
03:31:14,524 --> 03:31:20,171
a circular reef to the southwest, near the
Hespit.

3609
03:31:20,171 --> 03:31:22,076
MATT: Captain Adella. That would be your
best bet.

3610
03:31:22,076 --> 03:31:23,777
LAURA: Captain Adella.

3611
03:31:23,777 --> 03:31:28,074
MATT: "Now." 
And he points off to the end of one of the

3612
03:31:28,074 --> 03:31:31,799
nearest docks, there's two that are close by,
and there's a long row of various ships that are

3613
03:31:31,799 --> 03:31:39,080
in the process of being loaded and unloaded,
but there appears to be one sailing ship.

3614
03:31:39,269 --> 03:31:44,984
They have some galleys and long-ships along the
side, but there's a sailing ship with the sails

3615
03:31:44,984 --> 03:31:55,356
currently tied up and bound to the mast,
and a crew that is lounging on the deck.

3616
03:31:55,356 --> 03:32:00,319
There is a woman, towards the edge, that's just
walking past. You cannot make out a lot of details

3617
03:32:00,319 --> 03:32:02,416
from this point, but he points over.

3618
03:32:02,416 --> 03:32:06,607
"That is Captain Adella. She will be able to 
help you."

3619
03:32:06,607 --> 03:32:08,469
LAURA: Thank you so much, Dockmaster.

3620
03:32:08,469 --> 03:32:12,490
MATT: Of course. Now, if you wish to charter, 
speak with her. Let her know that the

3621
03:32:12,490 --> 03:32:15,538
Dockmaster is the one that brought you that point,
and all shall be well.

3622
03:32:15,538 --> 03:32:16,804
LAURA: Wonderful.

3623
03:32:16,804 --> 03:32:21,938
MATT: "All right. Good luck, travel safe."
And he turns around and walks aw--

3624
03:32:21,938 --> 03:32:24,356
LAURA: Percy, do we tip him? I don't know how this
works.

3625
03:32:24,356 --> 03:32:25,790
TALIESIN: No, I think we just--

3626
03:32:25,790 --> 03:32:27,368
SAM: No, we do not tip him.

3627
03:32:27,368 --> 03:32:28,367
LAURA: Oh, all right.

3628
03:32:28,367 --> 03:32:31,478
TRAVIS: Can I just ask before we leave,
how much are the ships that are for sale?

3629
03:32:31,478 --> 03:32:35,292
MATT: Oh! Well, it depends on the ship that you 
are looking for. For a long-ship, no crew

3630
03:32:35,292 --> 03:32:41,595
of course, which is a fairly decent speed, 
requires maybe 30 to 40 rowers, and a handful

3631
03:32:41,595 --> 03:32:47,773
of deck hands, that would run you about 
10,000 gold pieces?

3632
03:32:47,773 --> 03:32:49,313
LAURA: Oh, that's it?

3633
03:32:49,313 --> 03:32:50,881
TALIESIN: That's a long-ship--

3634
03:32:50,881 --> 03:32:53,054
TRAVIS: Just let me ask the important questions,
you all retire.

3635
03:32:53,054 --> 03:32:54,705
LAURA: We don't even need that.

3636
03:32:54,705 --> 03:32:56,107
TALIESIN: We need a big-- we need a
bigger ship.

3637
03:32:56,107 --> 03:33:00,585
TRAVIS: If I wanted a ship that had, let's say,
this many sails,

3638
03:33:00,585 --> 03:33:05,370
and came with a crew, how much would 
that be, about?

3639
03:33:05,370 --> 03:33:07,057
MATT: Are you talking about a fully outfitted
galleon?

3640
03:33:07,057 --> 03:33:08,608
TRAVIS: That.

3641
03:33:08,608 --> 03:33:09,733
TALIESIN: Yes, yes you are.

3642
03:33:09,733 --> 03:33:12,588
MATT: I would put that...

3643
03:33:12,588 --> 03:33:16,006
well, I mean the crew you'd have to
pay whatever they're asking, but for the actual

3644
03:33:16,006 --> 03:33:21,639
ship, the general asking price can range somewhere
in around 30,000 to 40,000 gold pieces.

3645
03:33:21,639 --> 03:33:25,169
TRAVIS: 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, that's what 
I thought. Yep. Thank you.

3646
03:33:25,169 --> 03:33:28,083
MATT: Right. Obviously a man of the world.

3647
03:33:28,083 --> 03:33:33,059
TALIESIN: Do you want a galleon, Grog?

3648
03:33:33,059 --> 03:33:36,606
TRAVIS: These dock pretzels are amazing.

3649
03:33:36,606 --> 03:33:40,113
SAM: He's literally picking up dried pieces of 
seagull poop.

3650
03:33:40,113 --> 03:33:42,281
(all laugh)

3651
03:33:42,281 --> 03:33:43,789
TALIESIN: There is this thing for seasickness, 
with seaweed--

3652
03:33:43,789 --> 03:33:44,581
LAURA: Dock pretzels.

3653
03:33:44,581 --> 03:33:47,055
TRAVIS: It's not pretty.

3654
03:33:47,055 --> 03:33:50,113
MARISHA: Grog, that's-- that's not like free
peanuts at the tavern.

3655
03:33:50,113 --> 03:33:52,956
TALIESIN: That's not-- that's...

3656
03:33:52,956 --> 03:33:57,801
LAURA: That was so gross.

3657
03:33:57,801 --> 03:33:59,014
TRAVIS: Really crunchy.

3658
03:33:59,014 --> 03:34:00,411
MARISHA: The profile of that.

3659
03:34:00,411 --> 03:34:01,302
LAURA: Oh my god.

3660
03:34:01,302 --> 03:34:04,802
LIAM: There's protein in everything. Everything.

3661
03:34:04,802 --> 03:34:08,519
TRAVIS: Well, let's go get a ship.

3662
03:34:08,519 --> 03:34:12,525
LAURA: Oh my god. Wow. We could seriously 
buy a ship.

3663
03:34:12,525 --> 03:34:13,343
TALIESIN: We could, or we could just--

3664
03:34:13,343 --> 03:34:14,540
LAURA: I mean we have no need for a ship.

3665
03:34:14,540 --> 03:34:15,735
TALIESIN: What are we going to do when we're done
with it?

3666
03:34:15,735 --> 03:34:16,527
LAURA: I know, right?

3667
03:34:16,527 --> 03:34:18,175
TALIESIN: I know, really.

3668
03:34:18,175 --> 03:34:21,830
LAURA: We've gotta be frugal, even though we don't
have to be, we should be.

3669
03:34:21,830 --> 03:34:24,427
TALIESIN: It's not even frugal, this is just what 
you do once you have money--

3670
03:34:24,427 --> 03:34:25,096
LAURA: Exactly.

3671
03:34:25,096 --> 03:34:27,661
TALIESIN: -- you only buy things you need, and just
lease everything else.

3672
03:34:27,715 --> 03:34:30,268
It's very, very common. It's all good.

3673
03:34:30,268 --> 03:34:31,917
LAURA: All right.

3674
03:34:31,917 --> 03:34:33,000
TALIESIN: This is very true.

3675
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:34,959
MATT: All righty. As you guys walk to the edge 
of the--

3676
03:34:34,959 --> 03:34:35,813
TALIESIN: Leasing.

3677
03:34:35,813 --> 03:34:36,959
LIAM: It's true.

3678
03:34:36,959 --> 03:34:38,413
MATT: --aforementioned dock that was
pointed out,

3679
03:34:38,413 --> 03:34:42,837
you come to the outskirts of this
larger sailing ship, and as you begin to walk up,

3680
03:34:42,837 --> 03:34:46,422
and your footfalls 'clack-clack, clack-clack,
clack' against the dock, a couple of the

3681
03:34:46,422 --> 03:34:50,390
deckhands that are kind of leaning off to the
side, kind of just looking up, one of them appears

3682
03:34:50,390 --> 03:34:56,583
to be taking a hit off of a flask of some kind,
both hear the footfalls and get up and turn

3683
03:34:56,583 --> 03:35:00,775
around, spin and look. "Cap'n? Cap'n!"

3684
03:35:00,775 --> 03:35:07,150
And they kind of point over and the
coat-wearing figure that you saw walking across

3685
03:35:07,150 --> 03:35:13,461
the deck of the ship spins around, and begins to
abruptly quicken her pace in the direction of the

3686
03:35:13,461 --> 03:35:20,259
gangplank that leads off onto the side of the
dock. As she comes up to the edge, reaching and

3687
03:35:20,259 --> 03:35:27,907
grabbing the sides of it, you see before you a
woman with long, sea-air tattered mass of hair.

3688
03:35:27,907 --> 03:35:34,295
It is just this halo of crimped, curled,
and wild dark hair that's also been sun-bleached

3689
03:35:34,295 --> 03:35:42,345
to the point where the tips kinda go light.
It is crazed in appearance immediately as she

3690
03:35:42,345 --> 03:35:47,881
arrives. She looks spry and somewhat young,
maybe late 20s early 30s, but her skin has been

3691
03:35:47,881 --> 03:35:51,385
very heavily weathered from all these days at sea,
and you can see already she's getting these crows

3692
03:35:51,385 --> 03:36:02,049
nests at the corners of her face, but has a very
bright smile, and her light brown coat hangs just

3693
03:36:02,049 --> 03:36:12,185
past her calf-high boots. She looks like the kind
of woman who captains a ship. As she glances over,

3694
03:36:12,185 --> 03:36:16,688
"Hi. You looking for a crew?"

3695
03:36:16,688 --> 03:36:19,198
MARISHA: You look like a pirate!

3696
03:36:19,198 --> 03:36:23,099
MATT: I do not look like a pirate. Why would
you say that?

3697
03:36:23,099 --> 03:36:24,983
TALIESIN: She meant it as a compliment.

3698
03:36:24,983 --> 03:36:29,968
MARISHA: Where do you buy your clothes?

3699
03:36:29,968 --> 03:36:32,893
MATT: Are you looking for a crew or not?

3700
03:36:32,893 --> 03:36:36,719
LAURA: Why, yes we are! I assume you're
Captain Adella.

3701
03:36:36,719 --> 03:36:40,876
MATT: Yes. (laughs) I see my reputation 
precedes me.

3702
03:36:40,876 --> 03:36:42,195
TALIESIN: By about ten feet.

3703
03:36:42,195 --> 03:36:46,907
LAURA: Yes, it does. Dockmaster Abban speaks
very highly of you.

3704
03:36:46,907 --> 03:36:49,576
Do you know your way around the Ozmit?

3705
03:36:49,576 --> 03:36:53,870
MATT: Quite a bit actually, I do. Where you 
looking to go?

3706
03:36:53,870 --> 03:36:57,218
LAURA: Near the Hespit Sea? Near the Hespit? I 
don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

3707
03:36:57,218 --> 03:36:58,168
MARISHA: Yep, that's right. Southwest.

3708
03:36:58,168 --> 03:36:59,247
LIAM: Hespit-bound.

3709
03:36:59,247 --> 03:37:00,201
LAURA: Ish.

3710
03:37:00,201 --> 03:37:03,119
MATT: No. We don't travel to the Hespit. That's--

3711
03:37:03,195 --> 03:37:04,816
LAURA: It's near the Hespit, not quite--

3712
03:37:04,816 --> 03:37:08,225
MARISHA: Have you stumbled upon Vesrah?

3713
03:37:08,225 --> 03:37:09,788
MATT: Vesrah, I know of.

3714
03:37:09,788 --> 03:37:11,798
LAURA: Oh! Perfect.

3715
03:37:11,798 --> 03:37:13,649
MATT: I know of it.

3716
03:37:13,649 --> 03:37:17,842
MARISHA: All right.

3717
03:37:17,842 --> 03:37:18,869
LAURA: Goodness gracious.

3718
03:37:18,869 --> 03:37:22,031
TALIESIN: We would be excited to make it worth 
your while.

3719
03:37:22,031 --> 03:37:24,816
MATT: How worth your while?

3720
03:37:24,816 --> 03:37:29,165
LAURA: How worth our while are you thinking?

3721
03:37:29,165 --> 03:37:31,415
TALIESIN: What is your while worth, I imagine?

3722
03:37:31,415 --> 03:37:34,993
MATT: Well, we have a crew here, 12 deckhands, 
my captaining and navigating skills,

3723
03:37:34,993 --> 03:37:42,572
a first mate, and the use of the ship... 
that would run you-- let's put it

3724
03:37:42,572 --> 03:37:46,486
at 150 gold per day for chartering the
ship.

3725
03:37:46,486 --> 03:37:48,545
TALIESIN: There's six of us and a bear.

3726
03:37:48,545 --> 03:37:51,359
MATT: (laughs)

3727
03:37:51,359 --> 03:37:54,012
TALIESIN: The bear sleeps in jewelry.

3728
03:37:54,012 --> 03:37:55,189
SAM: And a robot.

3729
03:37:55,189 --> 03:37:57,944
TALIESIN: Oh, and a robot. An automaton. Can I
say automaton?

3730
03:37:57,944 --> 03:38:00,438
SAM: He doesn't eat, it'll be fine.

3731
03:38:00,438 --> 03:38:01,694
TALIESIN: Okay.

3732
03:38:01,694 --> 03:38:04,984
MATT: Well this has certainly got real 
interesting, didn't it? All right!

3733
03:38:04,984 --> 03:38:08,466
So, have we a deal?

3734
03:38:08,466 --> 03:38:09,908
TALIESIN: 150 gold a day?

3735
03:38:09,908 --> 03:38:11,766
LIAM: That's nothing for us.

3736
03:38:11,766 --> 03:38:13,932
LAURA: How many crew-- 12-man crew?

3737
03:38:13,932 --> 03:38:16,770
LIAM: Vex'ahlia. We have so--

3738
03:38:16,770 --> 03:38:20,942
LAURA: No, I think that's a fair price.

3739
03:38:20,942 --> 03:38:24,050
MATT: All right. So.

3740
03:38:24,050 --> 03:38:29,019
SAM: She is such not a good negotiator. 
What is going on?

3741
03:38:29,019 --> 03:38:30,056
LIAM: Hey, buddy?

3742
03:38:30,056 --> 03:38:30,932
SAM: Oh, sorry.

3743
03:38:30,932 --> 03:38:31,599
LIAM: There's a lot of--

3744
03:38:31,599 --> 03:38:32,622
SAM: I will be quiet.

3745
03:38:32,622 --> 03:38:34,387
LIAM: -- inner working dynamics in this group
that you don't know anything about--

3746
03:38:34,387 --> 03:38:35,447
SAM: I'll be-- you're right.

3747
03:38:35,447 --> 03:38:36,423
LIAM: If you'd just wait a bit, all right?

3748
03:38:36,423 --> 03:38:37,808
SAM: You're right, I will be quiet.

3749
03:38:37,808 --> 03:38:38,821
LIAM: That sounds good.

3750
03:38:38,821 --> 03:38:40,465
TALIESIN: I'm so pleased.

3751
03:38:40,465 --> 03:38:45,060
MATT: "Fine. You've found yourself a leader, a 
captain, and a partner."

3752
03:38:45,060 --> 03:38:48,326
Shakes your hand. "So."

3753
03:38:48,326 --> 03:38:49,701
TRAVIS: Are you all right?

3754
03:38:49,701 --> 03:38:50,939
LAURA: Honestly, I feel...

3755
03:38:50,939 --> 03:38:56,890
MATT: Vesrah, you say? Crazy
water folk. Who am I to judge? But yes, six to

3756
03:38:56,890 --> 03:39:02,305
seven days travel at sea, depending on the
weather, of course. Storms are common this time of

3757
03:39:02,305 --> 03:39:06,441
year, do keep in mind we will be passing north of
the Hespit,

3758
03:39:06,441 --> 03:39:10,743
so be wary of any wandering bandit ships.

3759
03:39:10,743 --> 03:39:12,022
LAURA: Bandit ships?

3760
03:39:12,022 --> 03:39:14,440
MARISHA: Not pirates.

3761
03:39:14,440 --> 03:39:17,784
MATT: Or pirates, you can call them pirates as 
well, but we already had that conversation.

3762
03:39:17,784 --> 03:39:19,661
MARISHA: And you are definitely not--

3763
03:39:19,661 --> 03:39:21,792
MATT: Nope.

3764
03:39:21,792 --> 03:39:22,806
MARISHA: --a pirate.

3765
03:39:22,806 --> 03:39:23,837
MATT: Not anymore.

3766
03:39:23,837 --> 03:39:27,160
MARISHA: Nope. You just look really cool.

3767
03:39:27,160 --> 03:39:29,439
TRAVIS: What kinda weapons you got 
on this ship?

3768
03:39:29,439 --> 03:39:38,250
MATT: Oh! We've got some ballistae. 
We travel with speed.

3769
03:39:38,250 --> 03:39:39,777
TRAVIS: Oh. It's a fast ship?

3770
03:39:39,777 --> 03:39:40,601
LIAM: What d'you mean?

3771
03:39:40,601 --> 03:39:41,902
MATT: Fast ship.

3772
03:39:41,902 --> 03:39:43,177
LIAM: You got-- you got nothing?

3773
03:39:43,177 --> 03:39:44,964
MARISHA: Oh, we don't need weapons. 
We're weapons!

3774
03:39:44,964 --> 03:39:45,798
LAURA: We're weapons.

3775
03:39:45,798 --> 03:39:46,962
TALIESIN: We're quite fierce.

3776
03:39:46,962 --> 03:39:48,527
MARISHA: We're the most deadly thing in this land.

3777
03:39:48,527 --> 03:39:54,595
LAURA: How often do sea monsters sprout up on
you? Ever? I've never been on the sea.

3778
03:39:54,595 --> 03:39:56,227
MATT: Often enough.

3779
03:39:56,227 --> 03:39:57,521
MARISHA: Often enough?

3780
03:39:57,521 --> 03:39:58,308
LAURA: Really?

3781
03:39:58,308 --> 03:39:59,924
LIAM: We have, we were just way high
above it.

3782
03:39:59,924 --> 03:40:01,655
LAURA: Well yeah, not like in it.

3783
03:40:01,655 --> 03:40:03,089
TRAVIS: Oh that's true, we have never 
been in a boat, yeah.

3784
03:40:03,089 --> 03:40:05,580
TALIESIN: Actually, that's a good question.

3785
03:40:05,580 --> 03:40:08,997
How many of us have actually been on a 
ship before?

3786
03:40:08,997 --> 03:40:11,277
LIAM: I'm afraid of getting nauseous, actually.

3787
03:40:11,277 --> 03:40:12,727
TALIESIN: Am I really-- come on.

3788
03:40:12,727 --> 03:40:13,944
SAM: I had a boat--

3789
03:40:13,944 --> 03:40:15,030
LAURA: You own boat shoes.

3790
03:40:15,030 --> 03:40:21,659
SAM: I had a boat in one of my larger baths that
I would take at night, and it would go on epic

3791
03:40:21,659 --> 03:40:26,893
adventures through the bubbles! But never
quite at sea.

3792
03:40:26,893 --> 03:40:28,608
TRAVIS: What was the boat's name?

3793
03:40:28,608 --> 03:40:33,049
SAM: The boat was the SS...

3794
03:40:33,049 --> 03:40:33,930
... that's it.

3795
03:40:33,930 --> 03:40:37,018
(all laugh)

3796
03:40:37,018 --> 03:40:39,147
TALIESIN: Even better than I could have 
possibly imagined.

3797
03:40:39,147 --> 03:40:44,267
MATT: That's adorable. Well, welcome to my ship.
She is called the Drensala Vis--

3798
03:40:44,267 --> 03:40:46,105
SAM: That's such a cool name.

3799
03:40:46,105 --> 03:40:46,953
LIAM: Drensala Vis.

3800
03:40:46,953 --> 03:40:48,345
MARISHA: Drensala Vis.

3801
03:40:48,345 --> 03:40:49,222
LIAM: Drensala Vis!

3802
03:40:49,222 --> 03:40:50,139
TALIESIN: The Drensala Vis.

3803
03:40:50,139 --> 03:40:51,475
MATT: It is Marquesian for Luck of the Mother.

3804
03:40:51,475 --> 03:40:53,021
TALIESIN: Mother Lucker.

3805
03:40:53,021 --> 03:40:54,476
LIAM: Mother Lucker.

3806
03:40:54,476 --> 03:40:57,903
MATT: Treat her well and she'll treat
you well in kind. Respect my crew, respect my

3807
03:40:57,903 --> 03:41:05,499
authority, respect our direction, and we'll do
just fine. So! To the crazy water people.

3808
03:41:05,499 --> 03:41:08,325
Welcome on board the Drensala Vis.

3809
03:41:08,325 --> 03:41:09,608
TALIESIN: Aye, Captain.

3810
03:41:09,608 --> 03:41:11,006
LAURA: Do we need anything? Do we need anything
before we do--

3811
03:41:11,006 --> 03:41:12,261
MARISHA: Did she just say crazy water people?

3812
03:41:12,261 --> 03:41:13,758
LIAM: Too many mother luckers!

3813
03:41:13,758 --> 03:41:15,596
LAURA: Let's do it!

3814
03:41:15,596 --> 03:41:17,265
MARISHA: I don't think we need anything. 
Do we need anything?

3815
03:41:17,265 --> 03:41:18,947
TALIESIN: I think as long as the ship is prepared 
and has--

3816
03:41:18,947 --> 03:41:20,217
TRAVIS: Anything you can buy on dry land?

3817
03:41:20,217 --> 03:41:21,985
TALIESIN: --everything stocked, everything it 
needs, I think we're just reasonable.

3818
03:41:21,985 --> 03:41:24,756
TRAVIS: I've got a couple canisters of underwater 
breathing that nobody else has.

3819
03:41:24,756 --> 03:41:30,492
TALIESIN: And I have the remnants of several
bottles of liquor. I'm quite pleased.

3820
03:41:30,492 --> 03:41:32,880
MARISHA: I will come stacked with some 
water-breathing stuff.

3821
03:41:32,880 --> 03:41:34,663
I think we can do it to eight people for
like an hour or something like that?

3822
03:41:34,663 --> 03:41:36,093
TRAVIS: There you go.

3823
03:41:36,093 --> 03:41:37,634
LIAM: That'll help in the middle of the ocean.

3824
03:41:37,634 --> 03:41:39,329
MARISHA: That'll definitely help.

3825
03:41:39,329 --> 03:41:43,848
LAURA: Do you think that Raven's Slumber is
waterproof?

3826
03:41:43,848 --> 03:41:46,376
MATT: You imagine the enchantment probably 
is waterproof.

3827
03:41:46,376 --> 03:41:49,418
LAURA: All right. I would hate to-- little baby, 
mini Trinket in there

3828
03:41:49,418 --> 03:41:51,416
gets like drowned or something if I'm underwater.

3829
03:41:51,416 --> 03:41:53,359
LIAM: Yeah. You don't wanna drop the iPhone 
in the toilet.

3830
03:41:53,359 --> 03:41:55,748
LAURA: Exactly. Or the bathtub.

3831
03:41:55,748 --> 03:41:57,420
TRAVIS: About what time of day is it right now?

3832
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:58,696
LIAM: What do you mean?

3833
03:41:58,696 --> 03:42:04,154
MATT: Right now, it's a little bit past three 
o'clock in the afternoon.

3834
03:42:04,209 --> 03:42:06,944
TRAVIS: Shouldn't we go out early in the morning?

3835
03:42:06,944 --> 03:42:08,455
TALIESIN: Why?

3836
03:42:08,455 --> 03:42:11,470
TRAVIS: Isn't that what you do? You, like, 
set sail--

3837
03:42:11,470 --> 03:42:13,234
SAM: You can sail all night while we sleep
on the ship.

3838
03:42:13,234 --> 03:42:14,724
LAURA: I wanna sleep on the ship!

3839
03:42:14,724 --> 03:42:16,821
MARISHA: It's gonna be like a seven-hour trip--
or a seven-day trip.

3840
03:42:16,821 --> 03:42:18,154
TALIESIN: You're gonna get to sleep on a hammock,
Grog.

3841
03:42:18,154 --> 03:42:19,111
LIAM: You can spend days on a ship.

3842
03:42:19,111 --> 03:42:19,823
TALIESIN: There'll be a hammock.

3843
03:42:19,823 --> 03:42:21,208
TRAVIS: What if it's only a three-hour tour?

3844
03:42:21,208 --> 03:42:23,488
LIAM: Tary, there wo-- what is that in reference
to?

3845
03:42:23,488 --> 03:42:24,937
TALIESIN: No. I'm not even dignifying that
with a groan--

3846
03:42:24,937 --> 03:42:26,523
TRAVIS: Come on, Tal, you're with me.

3847
03:42:26,523 --> 03:42:28,339
TALIESIN: That would not even-- I expect
better of you.

3848
03:42:28,339 --> 03:42:31,853
LIAM: It would make for a good
beginning of a chapter to set out at dawn.

3849
03:42:31,853 --> 03:42:36,405
SAM: That is true. Poetically it would be nice, 
but--

3850
03:42:36,405 --> 03:42:37,655
TALIESIN: He could just write that we set
out at dawn.

3851
03:42:37,655 --> 03:42:42,298
SAM: I am eager to get my adventuring on, 
L.E.B., so I am eager to go.

3852
03:42:42,298 --> 03:42:43,133
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

3853
03:42:43,133 --> 03:42:45,917
TALIESIN: Little elf girl. L.E.B. Little elf boy.

3854
03:42:45,925 --> 03:42:46,923
TRAVIS: I'm fine with that.

3855
03:42:46,923 --> 03:42:47,556
MARISHA: Adella.

3856
03:42:47,556 --> 03:42:48,722
MATT: Yes?

3857
03:42:48,722 --> 03:42:49,345
LIAM: Little elf boy?

3858
03:42:49,345 --> 03:42:52,916
MARISHA: Oh, been on the sea a little long. Is 
your crew ready to go?

3859
03:42:52,916 --> 03:42:56,322
Or would it be better to set sail in the morning?

3860
03:42:56,322 --> 03:43:01,044
MATT: Well. We leave at your leisure,
but we're not against

3861
03:43:01,044 --> 03:43:05,228
the idea of a raucous final evening at the 
local tavern.

3862
03:43:05,228 --> 03:43:07,838
LAURA: How many beds do you have on that ship?

3863
03:43:07,838 --> 03:43:09,556
SAM: You're asking us to get her drunk?

3864
03:43:09,556 --> 03:43:10,326
LIAM: Well...

3865
03:43:10,326 --> 03:43:11,275
SAM: Is that true?

3866
03:43:11,275 --> 03:43:12,295
LIAM: I mean--

3867
03:43:12,295 --> 03:43:13,148
SAM: Is that what's happening?

3868
03:43:13,148 --> 03:43:17,092
LIAM: We've really been through the
shit, so I'm not opposed. Just saying.

3869
03:43:17,092 --> 03:43:22,167
MATT: Not including for my crew? we have bunks
for at least 15 other passengers.

3870
03:43:22,167 --> 03:43:23,080
MARISHA: Okay.

3871
03:43:23,080 --> 03:43:25,578
LAURA: Bunks? Or rooms? I mean, obviously you
don't have rooms for--

3872
03:43:25,578 --> 03:43:29,066
MATT: Between the bunks, six rooms.

3873
03:43:29,066 --> 03:43:30,910
LIAM: How many bunks per room?

3874
03:43:30,910 --> 03:43:32,146
MATT: Two or three, depending.

3875
03:43:32,146 --> 03:43:32,967
LAURA: Oh.

3876
03:43:32,967 --> 03:43:34,487
LIAM: That's weird.

3877
03:43:34,487 --> 03:43:35,199
LAURA: All right.

3878
03:43:35,199 --> 03:43:36,211
TALIESIN: No, no. It's quite common.

3879
03:43:36,211 --> 03:43:36,949
LAURA: No, it's totally doable.

3880
03:43:36,949 --> 03:43:37,712
LIAM: No, it's weird.

3881
03:43:37,712 --> 03:43:38,652
TALIESIN: No, it's quite common.

3882
03:43:38,652 --> 03:43:39,396
LIAM: I disagree.

3883
03:43:39,396 --> 03:43:41,427
TALIESIN: I think it's perfectly fine.

3884
03:43:41,427 --> 03:43:44,226
LIAM: Well, you're fucked.

3885
03:43:44,226 --> 03:43:45,903
LAURA: Let's just go.

3886
03:43:45,903 --> 03:43:46,808
MATT: If you don't find--

3887
03:43:46,808 --> 03:43:47,901
LIAM: Yeah. Fuck it.

3888
03:43:47,901 --> 03:43:50,588
MATT: "Good! Grab your things! On this ship! 
Let's set sail!"

3889
03:43:50,588 --> 03:43:55,165
Starts giving out orders to her crew,
seems to now kind of come to life, and they're

3890
03:43:55,165 --> 03:43:58,888
starting to go ahead and start pulling up anchor,
they're starting to get the sails ready.

3891
03:43:58,888 --> 03:44:04,718
You already can feel the spray of the water as
the tide's coming in now, the water's starting to

3892
03:44:04,718 --> 03:44:11,008
get a little choppier as it's hitting up against
the side of the docks and the shore end.

3893
03:44:11,008 --> 03:44:14,925
SAM: A sea voyage. This is unprecedented.

3894
03:44:14,925 --> 03:44:15,680
LIAM: Oh, jeez.

3895
03:44:15,680 --> 03:44:21,637
SAM: Doty, take down every word of anyone saying
anything ever on this whole trip.

3896
03:44:21,637 --> 03:44:24,777
This is amazing. I'm so excited.

3897
03:44:24,777 --> 03:44:30,586
MATT: Doty stops for a second, leans back, and 
then starts scribbling furiously

3898
03:44:30,586 --> 03:44:32,843
at anything that he can pick up within earshot.

3899
03:44:32,843 --> 03:44:37,758
LIAM: Tary, staring off into the distance, shat his 
pants. Crying, into his poo--

3900
03:44:37,758 --> 03:44:41,419
SAM: Well, okay, all right, so zing, you got me.

3901
03:44:41,419 --> 03:44:42,708
TRAVIS: He pulls out of his waistband--

3902
03:44:42,708 --> 03:44:44,116
(all laugh)

3903
03:44:44,116 --> 03:44:49,239
TRAVIS: -- and notices the tiny member 
between his legs.

3904
03:44:49,239 --> 03:44:51,790
SAM: You're smarter than I thought, you.

3905
03:44:51,790 --> 03:44:54,760
LIAM: No, I'm as smart as you thought I was.

3906
03:44:54,760 --> 03:44:59,666
MATT: Eventually, the ship disembarks,
and begins making its way further out

3907
03:44:59,666 --> 03:45:07,908
into the water, just as the sun begins to
set into the slightly orange, purple, and dark

3908
03:45:07,908 --> 03:45:13,271
blues of the end of daylight. You can see the
various lights in Emon come on, especially towards

3909
03:45:13,271 --> 03:45:21,331
the dock, as the night comes to life. And out the
opposite side, the sparse clouds that are

3910
03:45:21,331 --> 03:45:28,836
scattered in the distance, the ship picks up the
winds and pushes with guiding speed out to the

3911
03:45:28,836 --> 03:45:33,077
southwest, into the depths of the Ozmit Sea.

3912
03:45:33,077 --> 03:45:35,121
And that's where we'll pick up next session!

3913
03:45:35,121 --> 03:45:36,323
TALIESIN: And so--

3914
03:45:36,323 --> 03:45:37,283
MARISHA: Moana!

3915
03:45:37,283 --> 03:45:41,957
TALIESIN: As our ship sinks slowly in the
west, we bid farewell!

3916
03:45:41,957 --> 03:45:47,086
MARISHA: It just slowly sinks.

3917
03:45:47,086 --> 03:45:49,382
MATT: I finally get to use the ocean
voyage audio!

3918
03:45:49,382 --> 03:45:51,608
(all cheer)

3919
03:45:51,608 --> 03:45:53,177
MATT: Had that on my playlist for a long-ass time.

3920
03:45:53,177 --> 03:45:54,803
MARISHA: Ocean voyage!

3921
03:45:54,803 --> 03:45:56,525
MATT: Awesome.

3922
03:45:56,525 --> 03:45:57,545
MARISHA: We're going on a cruise, you guys!

3923
03:45:57,545 --> 03:45:58,955
MATT: That took some interesting turns tonight!

3924
03:45:58,955 --> 03:46:02,718
MARISHA: Now we learn how shitty cruises are.

3925
03:46:02,718 --> 03:46:05,165
TALIESIN: I love ships. Ships are great.

3926
03:46:05,165 --> 03:46:06,719
LIAM: Everybody's vomiting.

3927
03:46:06,719 --> 03:46:07,570
MATT: Pretty much.

3928
03:46:07,570 --> 03:46:10,143
TALIESIN: I think I'm the only character who's 
spent some time on a boat, at this point.

3929
03:46:10,143 --> 03:46:11,054
MARISHA: Well, and Pike.

3930
03:46:11,054 --> 03:46:12,049
TALIESIN: Who's been on a ship. And Pike--

3931
03:46:12,049 --> 03:46:13,292
MARISHA: Well, Pike's not here--

3932
03:46:13,292 --> 03:46:14,371
LIAM: I'm on a boat!

3933
03:46:14,371 --> 03:46:16,397
MATT: Yeah, Pike's still back at home.
Ashley, come back to us!

3934
03:46:16,397 --> 03:46:17,130
LAURA: I know!

3935
03:46:17,130 --> 03:46:19,666
MATT: Blindspot, stop filming! You finished your
season, right?

3936
03:46:19,666 --> 03:46:20,652
LIAM: Almost, almost.

3937
03:46:20,652 --> 03:46:22,082
LAURA: Almost. So close!

3938
03:46:22,082 --> 03:46:23,399
LIAM: Getting there.

3939
03:46:23,399 --> 03:46:24,996
MATT: We'll get her back. Guys, thank you 
so much.

3940
03:46:24,996 --> 03:46:28,090
LIAM: What an episode.

3941
03:46:28,090 --> 03:46:30,802
MATT: Ridiculous fucking people.

3942
03:46:30,802 --> 03:46:31,536
MARISHA: That was so good.

3943
03:46:31,536 --> 03:46:35,508
MATT: We're gonna pick up next week, as you head
deeper into the Ozmit Sea towards Vesrah.

3944
03:46:35,508 --> 03:46:37,216
Thank you again Loot Crate for being our awesome
sponsors this evening--

3945
03:46:37,216 --> 03:46:38,442
ALL: Lootcrate!

3946
03:46:38,442 --> 03:46:42,276
MATT: -- you've been fantastic. The rest
of you guys, rest well, sleep well,

3947
03:46:42,276 --> 03:46:44,040
and is it Thursday yet?

3948
03:46:44,114 --> 03:46:45,634
LAURA: I'll most likely kill you in the morning.

3949
03:46:45,634 --> 03:46:46,957
MATT: Have a good night.

3950
03:46:46,957 --> 03:51:28,305
