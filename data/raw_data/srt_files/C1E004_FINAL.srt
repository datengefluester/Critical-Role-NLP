1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:07,158
MATT: Everyone, welcome to the new
episode of Critical Role.

2
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:09,003
This evening, we luckily
have Ashley Johnson

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:10,731
back in as her character Pike.

4
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:13,462
Unfortunately, Laura
Bailey will be gone for

5
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,669
most of the game, possibly,
she might come in,

6
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,160
'cause she's busy recording
a show with Wil Wheaton.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,211
It's gonna be a great
show, but we'll miss her,

8
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,130
until she shows up.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,030
However, we shall see what
the next chapter has in store

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,863
in just a moment.

11
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,696
In the meantime,

12
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:29,869
let's go ahead and get you situated
with the character backgrounds.

13
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,412
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

14
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:35,579
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

15
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,743
A goliath of towering height and size.

16
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:43,898
This barbarian has an appetite for the two

17
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:45,846
great loves in his life:

18
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,763
combat, women, and ale.

19
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:50,776
(record scratch)

20
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:51,665
Wait.

21
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,164
Easily the brains of the group,

22
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,541
Grog is often consulted
for his vast knowledge

23
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,653
of shapes, colors, and
(giggles), shiny things.

24
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,567
But also ale.

25
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:07,603
In his early years, armed
with his two handed gray axe,

26
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:09,857
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

27
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:13,280
amongst the ranks of his
family's wandering herd.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,410
But after coming upon

29
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,669
an unsuspecting elderly
gnome in the woods,

30
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:21,748
he objected to the killing
of such an innocent life.

31
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,915
A creature of impulse, Grog
felt only pity for this,

32
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,962
this terrified little thing.

33
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:33,242
His disobedience cost him dearly.

34
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:36,727
Beaten bloody, and banished
by the herd leader,

35
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:40,894
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned, and left to die.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,657
Exiled from his herd,

37
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:46,898
it was then that the
relative of the very gnome

38
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,315
he fought to save, saved him.

39
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,071
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

40
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,143
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

41
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:01,631
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

42
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,458
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

43
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,628
entire taverns to wrestling matches.

44
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,112
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house,

45
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:13,612
where you pay for lady favors.

46
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,701
Also ale.

47
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,650
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

48
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,887
would leave you with little information

49
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,762
on the half-elven druid.

50
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,079
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

51
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,599
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

52
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,319
Of course it would be
unwise to underestimate her

53
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,079
based on first impressions.

54
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,773
(thunder clap)

55
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,344
Under that unintimidating, petite frame

56
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,957
is a vicious beast,
waiting to be unleashed,

57
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,364
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

58
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,762
of champions pee their pants.

59
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:45,595
Literally.

60
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,735
(giggles)

61
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:49,640
Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people,

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,292
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

63
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,252
and the elemental magics.

64
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,929
It is her people's inherent duty

65
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:58,712
to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

66
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,427
where the four elemental planes

67
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:02,828
begin to bleed with this realm.

68
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,325
Since she was a little girl,

69
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,575
she had quite a knack
for air manipulation,

70
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,690
and beast shaping abilities.

71
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,718
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

72
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,334
to be little beasts.

73
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,334
Which, I do.

74
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:16,352
Anyways.

75
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,824
It wasn't long before the
headmaster of the tribe,

76
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,650
her father, Korren, realized
her true prodigious abilities,

77
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,877
and she was inveterated to succeed him

78
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,012
as the next headmaster.

79
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:30,108
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped,

80
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,769
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

81
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,605
teachings from ancient traditions,

82
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:37,105
and exceedingly high expectations.

83
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,944
Every druid leader-to-be
must embark on a journey

84
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:41,555
to seek out the sister tribes

85
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,052
in order to introduce
and establish respect

86
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,213
amongst the fellow headmasters.

87
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:50,270
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

88
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,073
When her father felt she was ready,

89
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:55,198
he set her on the path to
truly discovering herself,

90
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,852
not knowing when or if
she will ever return.

91
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,547
As she hiked down the
mountain towards Stilben,

92
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:03,977
she meditated on the task ahead.

93
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,314
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

94
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:09,326
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

95
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,881
and a wise, and compassionate leader.

96
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,386
With this knowledge,

97
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,719
one thought plays in repeat in her mind:

98
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,177
Is she even worthy?

99
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,773
TALIESIN: Percy was the
third of seven children,

100
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:26,689
born to a noble family who
lived far to the north,

101
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,140
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

102
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,962
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

103
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,504
Percy turned his
attentions to the sciences,

104
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,104
engineering, and naturalism.

105
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,333
One day, a mysterious couple

106
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,176
named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court.

107
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:44,159
During a feast held in their honor,

108
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,332
the Briarwoods violently
took control of the castle,

109
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,116
killing or imprisoning everyone

110
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,201
who would stand in their way.

111
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,296
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

112
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:55,699
only to be freed by his younger sister.

113
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,439
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

114
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,449
As they ran, Percy's sister

115
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,524
took several arrows to
the chest, and fell.

116
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:05,777
Percy kept running,

117
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:08,077
eventually jumping into a freezing river,

118
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,555
and floating unconscious to freedom.

119
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,409
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

120
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,365
He barely remembered the next two years

121
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:19,384
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

122
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:22,106
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

123
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:25,197
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

124
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:27,872
against those who destroyed his family.

125
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:32,039
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

126
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,304
(gunshot)

127
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,458
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard

128
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,331
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

129
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,015
Well gird your loins ladies

130
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,039
because he has his eyes on you.

131
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,342
A talented musician, master of disguise,

132
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,794
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

133
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:49,017
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

134
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,513
as he sings his own praises.

135
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,155
Born a poor gnome,

136
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:56,087
Scanlan used his endless
charm and soaring tenor voice

137
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:59,371
to croon for coin and
support his single mother.

138
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:02,226
One day he was discovered
by a half orc promoter,

139
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:06,046
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troop,

140
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,292
where he learned the ways of the world,

141
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:11,857
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

142
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:13,362
A loner much of his life,

143
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:15,161
Scanlan has never quite come to terms

144
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,941
with the violent death of his mother

145
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,996
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

146
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,542
While his years on the road provided many,

147
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:26,095
shall we say, educational
experiences with the opposite sex,

148
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,960
deep down Scanlan yearns for
the one thing he's never known:

149
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,395
the true love of a fellow gnome.

150
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:36,441
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

151
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,776
performer second, and
fighter a distant third.

152
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,074
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies,

153
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:44,068
but rarely draws blood,

154
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,913
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike.

155
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:49,051
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

156
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:51,832
a rollicking song, and
a twinkle in his eye

157
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:55,749
that melts hearts, and
makes the females swoon.

158
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:57,884
(sputtering)

159
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,071
ORION: Greetings, and salutations.

160
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,181
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

161
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,289
I hail from a town called Tirex,

162
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,291
located in the heart of Draconia.

163
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,672
Born from a politically respected family,

164
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:12,341
at the age of 15, I succeeded
in passing the sorcerer's right,

165
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:14,681
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

166
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,593
The judges in the Draconian high council

167
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,819
were amazed at how powerful my spells were

168
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,773
for how long I had been training.

169
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,778
At 20 years old,

170
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:24,243
I was the youngest appointed
member of the magic guild

171
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,885
in Draconian history.

172
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,867
For the next few years I almost went mad

173
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,365
from the malaise of being a guild member,

174
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,290
as it's rather boring.

175
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,944
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

176
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,858
unused for quite some time.

177
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,323
In the room were stacks of books and maps,

178
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:40,803
of the surrounding cities and areas

179
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,235
around the known world.

180
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,496
For months I would frequent the chamber,

181
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,578
and learn of artifacts from legend.

182
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:48,319
After a long period of research,

183
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,471
I made a list of artifacts
that caught my eye.

184
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,828
I brought these findings
to the high council

185
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,893
and was told that all of the information

186
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,269
in the chamber I stumbled
upon was either believed

187
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,074
to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries,

188
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,073
and hence were lost forever.

189
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,951
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

190
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,874
A year later I devised a ruse,

191
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:08,468
and managed to convince the city council

192
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,621
to lend support in me leaving Draconia

193
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,366
on a mission of peace and diplomacy

194
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,846
for the surrounding kingdoms,

195
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:15,724
going from town to town and making friends

196
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:18,318
and allies in and for
the name of Draconia.

197
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,089
Being a red dragonborn,

198
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,255
I had quite the task on
my hands, in that respect.

199
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,881
But it was exactly what I needed,

200
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,930
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

201
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,416
as I felt the truth was out there.

202
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,788
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

203
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:34,099
but I say poppycock to all that!

204
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,190
(sputtering)

205
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,592
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

206
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:40,624
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

207
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:42,984
I've also been known to be rather cunning,

208
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:46,651
loyal, happy go lucky,
and, well, dangerous.

209
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:50,936
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

210
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:55,870
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

211
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,135
LIAM: Never entirely welcome

212
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,086
in the company of elves or men,

213
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:03,019
Vax’ildan learned at a young
age to skip past formality,

214
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,386
preferring instead to
invite himself in your door.

215
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,814
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

216
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,666
Vax was born by a chance encounter

217
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,383
between elven royalty and human peasantry.

218
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,608
Raised by their mother
in their early years,

219
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,795
the twins were eventually
sent off to their father

220
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:21,021
in the elven capitol of Syngorn.

221
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:24,732
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

222
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,153
and their time in the capitol didn't last.

223
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,652
The siblings stole away one autumn night,

224
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,178
and set out on the open road.

225
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:33,929
After a few years of wandering,

226
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,816
they eventually decided
to return to their mother,

227
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,173
and journey back to the lands of their youth.

228
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:42,267
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

229
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,764
they returned to a pile of rubble.

230
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:48,427
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

231
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:51,305
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

232
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,521
they learned of the day the dragon came.

233
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,688
(roaring)

234
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,964
With their ties all severed,

235
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,798
Vax’ildan and his sister set out

236
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:04,360
to find their fortune together in Tal'dorei.

237
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,373
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

238
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,331
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

239
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:14,116
often by side-stepping them entirely.

240
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:17,830
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough,

241
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,487
(drawing blades)

242
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,111
the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

243
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,001
more than makes up the difference.

244
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,981
LAURA: Like so many half elves,

245
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,227
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life

246
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,821
suffering the cool reception of a people

247
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:34,155
who don't fully accept her.

248
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:37,233
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

249
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,738
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

250
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:43,729
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax’ildan

251
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:47,415
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

252
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:50,605
in this world were each other.

253
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,455
It was at the age of ten when the two

254
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,189
were taken from their mother,

255
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:56,055
and brought to live in Syngorn,

256
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,457
the isolated elven city
for which their father

257
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,129
was an ambassador.

258
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,525
He quietly took them in, but
always kept an icy distance.

259
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,313
And after too many years
of disdainful looks,

260
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:10,830
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind

261
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,835
and set out on their own.

262
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:16,958
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

263
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,447
and learning the ways of a thief.

264
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:22,176
While Vex kept to the woods.

265
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,469
She preferred the isolation.

266
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:27,686
Always the keen observer,
she learned to hunt,

267
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,036
and to track, to spy, and to shoot.

268
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,666
And through a series of fateful events,

269
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,368
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear--

270
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:41,241
her own stolen trinket--
to fight along side her

271
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,826
and protect her fiercely.

272
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,846
Also he is adorable.

273
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,013
And gives expert massages.

274
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,711
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

275
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,878
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

276
00:11:56,296 --> 00:12:00,028
A goliath of towering height and size,

277
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:02,279
this Barbarian has an appetite

278
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,211
for the two great loves in his life:

279
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,128
combat, women, and ale.

280
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:09,952
(record scratch)

281
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:10,885
Wait.

282
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:13,383
Easily the brains of the group,

283
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:16,777
Grog is often consulted
for his vast knowledge

284
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,901
of shapes, colors, and
(giggles), shiny things.

285
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,765
But also ale.

286
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:26,861
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

287
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,945
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

288
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:32,465
amongst the ranks of his
family's wandering herd.

289
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,814
But after coming upon an unsuspecting

290
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:36,384
elderly gnome in the wood--

291
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:38,167
MATT: Welcome back.

292
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,307
Unfortunately, we don't have
Pike's video ready yet.

293
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:41,140
I'm working on it.

294
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,973
ASHLEY: My bad.

295
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:42,842
MATT: This week got away from me,

296
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:43,922
and Ashley got it to me a little late,

297
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:45,551
but we'll have it up
next week, don't worry.

298
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,702
However we are happy
to have Ashley with us.

299
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,952
(all cheer)

300
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:53,941
She's come down from her BAFTA cloud.

301
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,342
(all laugh)

302
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,861
Which is amazing, congratulations again.

303
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,911
ASHLEY: Thank you guys.

304
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,940
MATT: So yeah, as a heads up too,

305
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,476
if you wanna do any quick
announcements real fast,

306
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:03,817
I think you had an announcement
you wanted to make.

307
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,492
ASHLEY: It's my mom's birthday today.

308
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:06,539
(all cheer)

309
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,628
MATT: Happy birthday Ashley's mom, yay!

310
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:09,641
ASHLEY: Her name's Nancy.

311
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,474
LIAM: Hi Nancy.

312
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:12,246
TRAVIS: Happy birthday, Nancy.

313
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:13,737
Totally watching this right now.

314
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,239
MARISHA: Is she watching?

315
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,562
ASHLEY: She probably is.

316
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,708
(all laugh)

317
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,791
MATT: Well, hello!

318
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,854
Also for those who are
Hearthstone players,

319
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:25,857
the new Black Hawk Mountain
Expansion came out today,

320
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:28,369
in which I voice Nefarian and Ragnaros.

321
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:29,653
(all cheer)

322
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:32,110
My vanilla-WoW-playing self 
from back in the day

323
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,982
is nerding out over that, so enjoy that.

324
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:35,289
Anyone have anything
else they wanna announce

325
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,258
or talk about?

326
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,361
Are we good to start?

327
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,293
SAM: Hi, mom!

328
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,126
MARISHA: Hi, mom.

329
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:40,915
MATT: All righty.

330
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:43,637
TRAVIS: I don't think my mom knows
what the internet is.

331
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,025
ORION: Related, I leveled my
undead holy priest to 64

332
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,518
last night, on Warcraft.

333
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,347
ZAC: We're just
about a thousand happy--

334
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:53,913
MATT: Congrats.

335
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,103
Way to go, level 64.

336
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,516
So you're just barely into
burning crusade, good man.

337
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,349
(all laugh)

338
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:01,645
TALIESIN: I got one too.

339
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:04,015
My brother who also works in video games

340
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,588
gave a talk at GVC this year,
and it just went online,

341
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:10,177
and not now but later you should watch

342
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:13,719
Alex Jaffe's talk on metagame balancing.

343
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,817
It's really really fun, it's fabulous,

344
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,229
and you learn a lot.

345
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,412
MATT: There you go, Alex Jaffe, look it up.

346
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:20,535
MARISHA: Alex is brilliant.

347
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:23,208
MATT: All right guys, so, getting
to the game at hand.

348
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,345
So little overview for the story,

349
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:27,902
the party has been sent
to the city of Kraghammer,

350
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:32,407
through a friend of theirs
named Arcanist Allura Vysoren.

351
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,257
A good friend of hers and a folk hero

352
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,686
throughout the land known
as Lady Kima of Vord,

353
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:39,412
who's the halfling paladin of Bahamut,
has gone missing.

354
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,848
She went on a vision quest

355
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,577
as part of a pilgrimage she's
been on for the past year,

356
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,344
and sensed a dark evil brewing

357
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,349
far beneath the city of Kraghammer.

358
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:50,873
Disappeared into the city and
hasn't been seen for weeks.

359
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,302
So Arcanist Allura asked the party,

360
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:56,028
hired them essentially, to
go and see her whereabouts.

361
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,248
Upon getting to Kraghammer,

362
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:00,072
they interacted with some
of the local characters,

363
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,905
eventually found theirself talking

364
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:05,313
to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who
owns the mines at the very bottom

365
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:08,151
of Kraghammer proper.

366
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:11,319
After a brief encounter
with a mutated abomination

367
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,663
of a Naga creature,

368
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,638
they were then hired by lord
Nostoc to go into the mines,

369
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,960
find whatever's creating
these abominations,

370
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,909
destroy whatever is the source of them,

371
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,290
and he will pay well and also pay for each

372
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,721
creature head that is
brought to him individually.

373
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,495
After getting into the mines,

374
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,074
a few battles ensue with
some of the local denizens,

375
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,982
couple of the umber hulks,
that were turned into snails,

376
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:34,776
and other interesting circumstances.

377
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,615
The party then found 
what looked to be

378
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,311
an entirely abandoned goblin city,

379
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,357
and a series of goblinoid corpses,

380
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,345
many of which had bored
holes in their skull

381
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:45,484
in various states of decay.

382
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:48,382
They found a long bridge
across an open chasm.

383
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,987
Upon traversing it,
Scanlan went invisible,

384
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,340
and found what looked
like a duergar war camp,

385
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,406
which are like ashy-skinned, evil dwarves

386
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:58,477
that live deep underground.

387
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,934
Watched a dwarf get executed
by what appeared to be

388
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,126
some sort of strange alienoid creature,

389
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,933
that was revealed to be an
illithid, or a mind flayer.

390
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,416
A being that is psychic
and consumes brains.

391
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,117
ASHLEY: Brains!

392
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,250
MATT: Upon returning,

393
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,959
the party had a plan to lead them

394
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,597
off of a illusionary cliff,
that went pretty well.

395
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:19,062
Ended up taking out a significant portion

396
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,773
of the charging army at the time.

397
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,054
Vax here, however, got
stunned on the way across

398
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:27,382
by the one mind flayer, nearly fell,
however was saved by Tiberius

399
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:28,669
at the last moment.

400
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:32,012
Nearly lost their magic
carpet, but it was retrieved.

401
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:33,893
ASHLEY: Wait, you still have
the magic carpet, right?

402
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,894
MATT: Yeah, it got recovered. Barely.

403
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,420
MARISHA: We got it back, it's okay.

404
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,969
TRAVIS: Not thanks to some.

405
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,962
MATT: (laughs)

406
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,557
After brief discussion, Keyleth and Vex

407
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,215
decided they didn't want to listen
to anyone's bullshit,

408
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,017
and hijacked magic carpet,

409
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:52,188
flew down into the chasm below,

410
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:55,473
and discovered behind one of
the underground waterfalls

411
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,890
some sort of a

412
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,752
mind flayer who was
cast out from the society,

413
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:04,048
covered in rags, kind of
a twisted physical form,

414
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,723
and after a very tense discussion

415
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,377
seemed to befriend it under the guise of

416
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:12,625
mutually agreed retribution
against those that are oppressive

417
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,682
to this whole chasm area.

418
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,146
MARISHA: Clarence.

419
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,700
LIAM and SAM: Clarota.

420
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,873
MATT: Clarota. I don't think he'll
take kindly to Clarence.

421
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:26,040
However, this is where we
left off the previous game.

422
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,016
ASHLEY: So nervous.

423
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,375
MATT: As you guys have gathered up,

424
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,623
and you've finished your luxurious song

425
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,123
to try and ease his torn form,

426
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,153
he finishes tapping his
toe in spite of himself.

427
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,238
Looks about the rest
of the group and says,

428
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,747
once again, not vocally,

429
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,525
but speaking directly into your mind,

430
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,341
through a horrifying whispered voice

431
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,037
that you cannot even close
your ears to get rid of,

432
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:56,860
"I think it's best we rest out of sight."

433
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,753
He points across the chasm,

434
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:02,277
to the war camp that is
looming across the way.

435
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,383
He begins to dart off
towards the abandoned

436
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,291
goblinoid village.

437
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,945
ORION: I guess we should follow him, then.

438
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:11,476
SAM: Yes, that's wise.

439
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,313
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

440
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,136
SAM: We follow.

441
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,603
TALIESIN: No, nothing can be there.

442
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:19,771
MATT: As you guys make your way in
toward the goblinoid village,

443
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:23,213
you can see Clarota who
is genuinely hovering

444
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,839
about a foot off the ground,

445
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,064
and kind of just coasting
around in a very creepy way.

446
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,515
Finds one tent, opens up and looks inside,

447
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:34,320
"Here, here we can talk."

448
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,403
Darts inside.

449
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,578
TRAVIS: We follow.

450
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:39,613
SAM: We do follow, yes.

451
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,362
MATT: As you're following--

452
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:42,195
TRAVIS: Oh crap.

453
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,028
SAM: Oh God, we're dead.

454
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,568
TRAVIS: Why?

455
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:46,083
Why would he touch his dice?

456
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,712
We're gonna die!

457
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:50,505
MATT: As you're following towards
the center of this town,

458
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,387
you, see in the distance,
a small light moving,

459
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,585
back from the direction
where you first saw

460
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:59,252
that duergar camp, where
Grog was assaulted.

461
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,832
TRAVIS: I don't recall that.

462
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,316
LIAM: Look back the way we came,

463
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:07,684
there's some sort of light up ahead.

464
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,362
ORION: That can't be good.

465
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,573
LIAM: Stay with Clarota, I'm
gonna go take a look,

466
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:12,446
Scanlan, come on.

467
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:13,946
SAM: I'm coming with.

468
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,892
MATT: Both of you guys roll stealth.

469
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,419
TRAVIS: I'll stay outside the
tent if somebody wants

470
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,502
to ask him how to get a
Magneto helmet like his.

471
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:23,510
(all laugh)

472
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,468
'Cause I'm gonna need that.

473
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:25,812
ORION: I'll talk to him.

474
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,577
SAM: It's just a roll? Not great.

475
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:28,757
Nine!

476
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:29,971
LIAM: 29.

477
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,753
TALIESIN: That's a number.

478
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,836
MATT: So, as you

479
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:38,160
officially vanish into the
ether and surrounding darkness,

480
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,958
Scanlan, who still has that song

481
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,827
stuck in his head from earlier,

482
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,646
his slow jam is just...
(laughs)

483
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,084
Abstractedly humming to
himself without realizing,

484
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,895
and calling a little bit of attention,

485
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:52,684
at which point you began
to hear some footsteps

486
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,443
in the distance that come
to an immediate halt.

487
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:58,072
LIAM: Grab Scanlan, put my hand
over his mouth, and say,

488
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,021
Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?

489
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,730
SAM: It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry!

490
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,575
(all laugh)

491
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:07,796
LIAM: With great power comes great
responsibility, shut up!

492
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:10,595
SAM: It's a gift I have to
share with the world!

493
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:12,074
LIAM: Later, later.

494
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:15,203
Save it for the mind flayer.

495
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:18,771
So with him tucked under
my arm like a football,

496
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:20,688
I start to creep further.

497
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:25,360
And try to make out--
if there's light from the lantern,

498
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,845
I can see in dim light, thanks to
daddy's blood, so.

499
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:30,175
I'm gonna try to figure
out what it is exactly

500
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,188
that I'm seeing.

501
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,328
MATT: Go ahead and make
a perception check.

502
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:35,011
SAM: I also have low light vision.

503
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:37,833
MATT: You can make perception
check with disadvantage,

504
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,318
because you're under his arm.

505
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,318
LIAM: Perception check? Oh.

506
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:41,631
SAM: Nope.

507
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,704
LIAM: Do I have any advantage on that?

508
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:45,757
MATT: No.
LIAM: 11.

509
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:46,590
MATT: All right.

510
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,369
Actually, directly
looking in the direction

511
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:50,972
of that duergar camp earlier,

512
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:53,663
you can see behind a pillar
that's blocking your view,

513
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:56,362
it's obstructing your view
of the actual camp proper,

514
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:58,492
you can see some movement in the light.

515
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,202
You hear some shuffling,
it sounds like plate.

516
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:07,603
You hear a voice just kind
of muttering to itself.

517
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:10,186
A familiar, female gnomish voice.

518
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,392
LIAM: Pike?

519
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:14,820
ASHLEY: Hey guys!

520
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,764
(all laugh)

521
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:17,931
ASHLEY: It's me, Pike!

522
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,239
LIAM: Jeez, where have you been?

523
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,930
ASHLEY: Oh man, I've had quite a time.

524
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,430
I've missed you guys terribly.

525
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,889
A lot has happened.

526
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm sure for you guys as well.

527
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,985
SAM: Not so much.

528
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,667
ORION: I say into my thing,
"Scanlan, what the hell's going on?"

529
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,294
SAM: Don't worry, it's a friend,
we'll bring her back soon.

530
00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:41,862
ORION: Okay, well,
there's a mind flayer here.

531
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:42,935
SAM: Keep him busy.

532
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:43,935
He likes slow jams.

533
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,221
ORION: Right, right.

534
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,195
MATT: As you guys take a look at Pike,

535
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:49,763
you notice she's fully armored, but dirty,

536
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,345
she's got sweat across her face,

537
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,494
looks like she may have
had a couple scuffles

538
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:55,942
on the way through here.

539
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:56,775
ASHLEY: I did.

540
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,629
MATT: She's got a wild look to her eyes.

541
00:21:58,629 --> 00:21:59,545
SAM: Oh my God.

542
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,333
MATT: Genuinely relieved to see you.

543
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,188
Pike, you've managed to come down here

544
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,546
through the front of the mines,

545
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:06,515
which for the most part have been clear.

546
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:08,963
You follow what details you can
after asking around

547
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:11,191
and discovering that the rest of your party

548
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:13,029
had ventured below without you.

549
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,028
You've followed the tracks best you can,

550
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:17,545
and are glad that you at
least chose the right path

551
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,835
and ran into them before you ran into
something far more dangerous.

552
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,045
What you were inspecting
was this campsite

553
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,884
that appeared to have been abandoned.

554
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:27,133
What caught your eye
was against the stone wall

555
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,207
right above the ring of stones that form

556
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:30,422
the fire itself,

557
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,588
there is a giant symbol
carved into the stone

558
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:35,296
that is a protective sigil of Bahamut,
the platinum dragon,

559
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:37,404
which is a religious symbol of protection,

560
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:39,923
used in different divine rituals.

561
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,426
LIAM: We were looking at that,

562
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,384
we couldn't make heads or tails of it.

563
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:44,771
You ever seen that before?

564
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:48,477
ASHLEY: No.

565
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:50,119
(all laugh)

566
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,498
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check.

567
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,367
LIAM: Are you sure?
Think about it, just for a moment longer.

568
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,999
ASHLEY: Well give me, actually,
let me rethink on this.

569
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:58,880
I think maybe--

570
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,706
MARISHA: So wait, are we all reunited?

571
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:02,153
LIAM: Oh, it's a natural 20!

572
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:04,692
MARISHA: Oh, welcome back Pike!

573
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:06,109
TRAVIS: The first roll.

574
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,522
MARISHA: Are we all reunited?

575
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:08,802
LIAM: You just forgot.

576
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:10,245
ASHLEY: I just-- you know what?

577
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,172
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it.

578
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,129
(all laugh)

579
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,444
MATT: You clutch your 
holy symbol instinctually

580
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:18,182
as you reach up and run your fingers
along the stonework,

581
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:20,504
tracing the carving across the stone.

582
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,079
As you do, your eyes close,

583
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,076
and you feel the warmth
of Sarenrae's presence

584
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,530
fill your mind for a second,
and for a split moment,

585
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,863
you can see a well-armored, very driven,

586
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:33,985
female halfling with hair pulled back

587
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:36,459
into tight brown braids,

588
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,828
a dark green cloak
thrown over one shoulder,

589
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:42,192
who's currently carving
that symbol into the stone.

590
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,948
You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord,

591
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:45,947
the one who left this symbol,

592
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,609
to protect her campsite
as she made up camp here.

593
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,759
You don't know how long
ago this transpired,

594
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,483
but this was definitely
left by her in this tunnel.

595
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:55,115
LIAM: What is it?

596
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,617
ASHLEY: It was left by a woman.

597
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:00,166
SAM: Lady Kima, 
the one we're trying to find?

598
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,421
ASHLEY: Yes, Lady Kima.

599
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:02,885
LIAM: How did you know that?

600
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,773
SAM: Me and Pike are like--

601
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:05,690
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

602
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,333
SAM: It's so great to see you, you
look fantastic by the way.

603
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,268
ASHLEY: I don't feel fantastic.

604
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:15,017
SAM: Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug.

605
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,063
Ooh, you smell a little.

606
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,807
I like it though.

607
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,516
Somehow it works on you.

608
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:23,683
LIAM: We're in a very complicated situation,

609
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,392
a lot has happened to us.

610
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,168
We found sort of a war camp down here,

611
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,251
and there is sort of a

612
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,477
being, I don't know what to call it.

613
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:40,839
He's got a little of
this going on, and he

614
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,076
speaks and lashes out through his mind.

615
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:46,478
We fought a huge force down here,

616
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:48,555
and then we ended up
falling into a cavern,

617
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,264
and then Keyleth and my sister

618
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:53,259
found another one, what are they called?

619
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,092
They're called--

620
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,415
illithids.

621
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,248
SAM: Yes, yes.

622
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:58,661
And we found a rogue one,

623
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:02,307
and we may team up with
him-- or her?-- to go back

624
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,273
and get revenge and maybe
kick some ass in the camp.

625
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:06,860
LIAM: This just happened.

626
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,301
He seems extremely dangerous, however,

627
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,487
the forces we faced in the other illithid

628
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,074
seem maybe worse.
So that's where we're at.

629
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,629
SAM: So welcome back.

630
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:20,125
Great, sounds like a fun time.

631
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,299
SAM: Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?

632
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,312
ASHLEY: Let's go kick some ass.

633
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:26,879
SAM: So we trot back over to
the dead goblin village.

634
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,299
MATT: All right, you make your
way back to the tent

635
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,887
that was originally scouted out.

636
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,796
The rest of the party's there waiting

637
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,462
as Clarota is awkwardly
sitting in the far end,

638
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:38,955
just looking out as all of you
slowly approach and enter the tent.

639
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,391
Not speaking, just reactionary,

640
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,644
and keeping a watch on all of you.

641
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,616
ORION: I turn to Clarota, I'm like,

642
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,137
"Ooh, that's our friend, Pike.

643
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,078
"She's a good ally.

644
00:25:49,078 --> 00:25:50,395
"Hello, Pike!"

645
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:51,598
ASHLEY: Hello everybody.

646
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:54,681
ALL: (gasp) Pike!

647
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,791
ORION: Sometimes we hug as allies, Clarota.

648
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,335
MARISHA: Where have you been?

649
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:02,585
ASHLEY Well, I had quite a time.

650
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:05,902
When we were up on the tower,

651
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,106
I noticed something,

652
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:10,456
and I felt...

653
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:13,456
I had to leave,
because I started to

654
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:16,001
have a vision.

655
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,318
ORION: Oh, those are fun.

656
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:24,444
ASHLEY: I feel like I should talk to
you guys about this later,

657
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:25,694
just because--

658
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:26,876
SAM: It's personal?

659
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,592
ASHLEY: What is your name? I'm so sorry.

660
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:30,577
I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.

661
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,706
MATT: You get a better look as
you approach this entity.

662
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:35,454
You see what looks like a very tall,

663
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:38,115
thin, gaunt-looking humanoid
with a hood over the head

664
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:39,666
as you approach.

665
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,604
You get a better look
at the facial features.

666
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:46,525
Smooth, kind of dull, bluish-purple skin.

667
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:49,860
These sunken, creepy,
yellowish green eyes,

668
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,215
and instead of where a
mouth or nose would be,

669
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,847
you see four slightly twitching tentacles.

670
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,398
Barely obscuring what looks like
a round lamprey-like toothed maw.

671
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:00,395
LIAM: Pike, this is Clarota.

672
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:03,108
We've just met.

673
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,274
ASHLEY: Can I shake his hand?

674
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:07,214
MATT: Do you wanna reach your hand out?

675
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:08,047
ASHLEY: Yes.

676
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,809
MATT: There is no physical response,

677
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,857
the hand is not extended, but you hear,

678
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:16,568
in the middle of your
mind, at full volume,

679
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,052
a creepy whispered voice go,

680
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:23,119
"Are you to be one of our allies as well?"

681
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:26,578
ASHLEY: Yes.

682
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,854
Of course.

683
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,712
MATT: "Very well, she may stay."

684
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,505
ORION: Thank you very much, Clarota.

685
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:36,015
ASHLEY: I take my hand and
scratch the back of my head.

686
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:37,762
(all laugh)

687
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:40,262
MARISHA: I take Pike and I kind of

688
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:44,246
pull her out of the tent
really quick, and I'm like--

689
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,472
SAM: Girl talk.

690
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,285
MARISHA: Okay he's like a mind flayer,

691
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:49,467
and we found him in a
hole under a waterfall,

692
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,539
but he's cool, but he wants vengeance.

693
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,412
ASHLEY: Is that-- the thing is
covering, so he can't be--

694
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:56,549
MARISHA: He's like outcast, yeah.

695
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,716
But he's gonna help us fight
all of his tribe who hates us.

696
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:04,488
LIAM: Clarota.

697
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:07,291
ASHLEY: Do we know for sure 
he's helping us?

698
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,212
ORION: Yes.

699
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:09,573
MARISHA: Yeah.

700
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:12,194
LIAM: Can you help us understand your kind?

701
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:14,222
Your history?

702
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:18,659
How you've come to be here and who this

703
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,654
individual is that is
fucking with your shit?

704
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:24,724
(all laugh)

705
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:27,288
MATT: Proverbial statement, I like that.

706
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,607
At which point Clarota's eyes narrow,

707
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,017
and you can feel just the
general mood and energy

708
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:34,036
of the inside of the tent grows dark.

709
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,266
It grows mildly

710
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,167
tense.

711
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,721
Suddenly you feel this
presence, a voice once again,

712
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,471
fill your mind as Clarota says,

713
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,013
"Seven years since I discovered my curse.

714
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:54,096
"My form was struck with
the brand of the Arcane.

715
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,133
"And these foul arts proved
difficult to conceal.

716
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,178
"My brethren could sense my impurity,

717
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,139
"my deviation, and cast me out.

718
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:14,582
"I was severed from the Elder Brain.

719
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:20,197
"And chased on threat of
death, should I return.

720
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:25,289
"I wandered these tunnels in squalor,

721
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,289
"feeding on what paltry
filth I could ensnare,

722
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:34,499
"and fleeing from the ones
I could not face alone.

723
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:41,043
"In my wandering, I discovered
a duergar stronghold,

724
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,430
"with a magma pool,

725
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,985
"and it proved to be a
decent source of sustenance

726
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:51,235
"for some time.

727
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:57,238
"Paying off the occasional straggler.

728
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,464
"Suddenly a great battle took place.

729
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:09,281
"It appeared something
had sieged the stronghold.

730
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:14,804
"Reading the surface
thoughts of the deep dwarves

731
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:17,450
"I encountered in the following weeks,

732
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,617
"I found a shift of power.

733
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:25,803
"Whatever had taken this hold had now

734
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:29,352
"demanded fealty of them.

735
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:34,164
"And they accepted when
faced with annihilation.

736
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:37,831
"This entity that took
the duergar by force,

737
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,947
"they called K'varn.

738
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,632
"I caught no sight of it.

739
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,739
"But the fear I could sense,

740
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:54,533
"from within these doors
were so primal, so great,

741
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:58,033
"that I knew to keep a distance to be safe.

742
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:05,115
"But four months ago
one of my estranged people,

743
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,545
"was captured by these ash-skins,

744
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:14,395
"and brought within the obsidian walls,

745
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:17,478
"for what I assumed was interrogation.

746
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:23,773
"Long after, the bulk of
the Duergar people marched

747
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:26,162
"in packs through the long, deep tunnels

748
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:29,786
"that led to my people's colony

749
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:30,953
"and attacked.

750
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:36,480
"Strangely, before much
bloodshed could occur,

751
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:42,029
"which I only assume was the
next step in this onslaught,

752
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,982
"the fighting stopped.

753
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:50,410
"And the colony allowed
the ash skins to waltz

754
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,577
"directly into the temple,
unharmed, unchallenged,

755
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,223
"where our Elder Brain resides.

756
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:05,182
"It wasn't until after I
discovered whoever this

757
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:09,349
"K'varn is, they themselves
infiltrated the temple,

758
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:14,800
"and somehow took the Elder
Brain under their own control.

759
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:20,942
"I watched as my people had
their will robbed of them.

760
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,580
"And they took the will of all the others

761
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,080
"that lived and breathed in these tunnels.

762
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:37,651
"Now, a terrible army is
forged of both factions.

763
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,376
"And they walk under the
banner of this K'varn.

764
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:53,203
"Since this, I've fled
back to the higher tunnels,

765
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,396
"and scrounged for materials so I could

766
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:58,432
"shield myself from
the iron grip influence

767
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:01,182
"of the now enslaved Elder Brain.

768
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:04,056
"It took me weeks.

769
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:08,832
"But I'm confident I'm
safe from its influence.

770
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:09,665
"For now."

771
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:15,490
TALIESIN: Is that the thing that
you wear upon your head?

772
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,056
MATT: As it pulls the hood back,

773
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,072
you see once again this kind of haphazard,

774
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:22,541
metallic cluster of patches of metal,

775
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:26,275
and iron, this dull kind
of blue metallish glow,

776
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:27,924
that you can only now
see once he's sitting

777
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,752
in near pitch darkness.

778
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:32,082
As he reaches up and
runs his finger along it,

779
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:32,915
"Yes.

780
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:36,670
"This I feel can protect me.

781
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,266
"But I think...

782
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,994
"I think there is a way to change
the tides of this circumstance,

783
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:49,827
"I feel that if I could
somehow free my people

784
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:54,493
"from the influence of K'varn,

785
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,874
"release its hold on the hive mind,

786
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:01,791
"my people would allow
me to rejoin the colony.

787
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,122
"To be one again with my family.

788
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:07,289
"My brethren."

789
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,628
LIAM: I have a few questions.
Is that all right?

790
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:15,293
MATT: "Yes."

791
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:18,460
LIAM: You and your brethren, without this,

792
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:21,944
do you think as one?

793
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,433
MATT: "We think as individuals,

794
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:28,911
but the hive mind connects us all.

795
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:33,079
"The hive mind gives us
knowledge, history, direction.

796
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:37,911
"It is the source of our family."

797
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:43,621
LIAM: So, one individual of your
family sees something,

798
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:50,606
the entire hive sees the
same, is that correct?

799
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:52,118
MATT: "Yes."

800
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,993
ORION: Oh dear, that's no good.

801
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,175
(all laugh)

802
00:34:56,175 --> 00:35:00,342
LIAM: And you mentioned the Arcane
being a stigma upon you?

803
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:04,263
MATT: At which point it turns its gaze away,

804
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:07,413
and slinks down
into its form slightly.

805
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:14,453
LIAM: What do your brethren put their faith in,

806
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:15,953
if not the Arcane?

807
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:21,061
MATT: "They put their faith in
the arts of the mind.

808
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,454
"Both understanding,

809
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:28,954
"manipulating, controlling, and devouring."

810
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,664
ORION: Clarota, we've already
allied ourselves with you,

811
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:38,772
as we've already agreed.

812
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,772
MATT: "You'll help me free my people?

813
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,122
"To be family again, to belong."

814
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,622
ORION: As we said, yes.

815
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:51,160
But the thing you wear on your head,

816
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,409
it would make us all the more

817
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:56,791
equipped to take on this task.

818
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:01,750
It's against such powerful mind
creatures, such as yourself,

819
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,637
I know my way around a
couple Arcane things,

820
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,399
but nothing of the mind control sorts.

821
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,865
If someone like me were to be influenced,

822
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:11,718
it would be very bad for our group.

823
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,497
Even yourself, perhaps.

824
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:17,478
It would do well to at least maybe show us

825
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,357
how you built it, and--

826
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,382
You get what I'm getting at, right?

827
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,825
TRAVIS: I would like a steel beanie as well.

828
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:26,972
ASHLEY: Basically, where do we get one of those?

829
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:29,948
MATT: "It would take weeks to build another."

830
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:30,781
TRAVIS: Weeks?

831
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,947
TALIESIN: I would like to take a
look into it if possible,

832
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:36,187
and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.

833
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:40,327
MARISHA: Maybe we can figure out 
something a little bit more jerryrigged.

834
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:44,494
TALIESIN: If we were all hidden, we would
have a distinct advantage.

835
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:49,252
TRAVIS: I have a very large bronze
pot in the bag of holding.

836
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,094
Could I wear that on me noggin?

837
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:52,645
TALIESIN: If you like.

838
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,249
MATT: It gives you a look in response and says,

839
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:59,416
"This protects me from the
influence of the hive mind,

840
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,852
"my preexisting connection."

841
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,040
TALIESIN: Could we be hidden from them?

842
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,236
Would there be a way

843
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:10,890
to cloak ourselves from
their understanding?

844
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,390
MATT: "Stay hidden from the others.

845
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:17,081
"Their sight is the mind's sight.

846
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:22,822
"The Elder Brain is a collection of
the once living mind flayers

847
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:25,394
"of my people."

848
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:29,257
LIAM: I have one more question,

849
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:32,635
and we have allied ourselves
to you, that's true.

850
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:36,802
But I'm curious to know,
hopefully our goals intertwine,

851
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,717
and we want the same thing.

852
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:43,476
But once that is achieved, and it will be,

853
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:46,393
what happens then for the Illithid?

854
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,030
Do you return to your home below?

855
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:55,317
Do your people harbor any

856
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:58,325
ambition to

857
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,302
move upward into Kraghammer?

858
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:08,673
MATT: It looks to the side and says,

859
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:12,256
"Our ambition is to
pursue the continuation

860
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,410
"of our knowledge-seeking.

861
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,964
"We have no interest in the surface.

862
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:24,964
"We only wish to spread
our dominion here below.

863
00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:29,813
"Expand our great city of Yug'Voril."

864
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:33,058
LIAM: I'm sorry, what was that name?

865
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:34,141
MATT: "Yug'Voril."

866
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:38,819
ORION: Sounds like a lovely town, Yug'Voril.

867
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,236
MATT: "It's beautiful."

868
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:44,938
TALIESIN: I feel that we could
come to an arrangement.

869
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,365
LIAM: I do as well.

870
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:50,582
TALIESIN: We would require of
you, at the very least,

871
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,738
safe passage once we have helped you

872
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,108
reunite with your people, for ourselves,

873
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,392
and for a friend of ours
who's lost in the darkness,

874
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,725
who we are here to retrieve.

875
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:07,131
MATT: "For this deed, of freeing
my people from this

876
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:13,437
"insidious presence that is K'varn..."

877
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,866
TALIESIN: Freeing all of our people.

878
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,783
MATT: "I believe this could be arranged."

879
00:39:21,857 --> 00:39:24,357
LIAM: Scanlan, does he speak true?

880
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,327
SAM: Uh.

881
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:28,463
Let's find out.

882
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:29,818
(all laugh)

883
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:32,524
SAM: I'm gonna just see if
I can detect any lies.

884
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:35,607
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

885
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:37,915
SAM: What am I adding to this?

886
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:38,748
LIAM: Insight.

887
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,996
SAM: Oh.

888
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,602
13.

889
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:44,422
I'm not an insight person.

890
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:45,375
ASHLEY: Oh, can I--

891
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,421
TRAVIS: (scoffs)

892
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:47,626
LIAM: 20 over here!

893
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:49,078
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

894
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:50,405
TRAVIS: She's rolled twice.

895
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:51,747
ASHLEY: Assisting, assisting.

896
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:52,536
(all laugh)

897
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,416
TALIESIN: All of your 20's,
running out.

898
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:57,228
MATT: It's too late for the assist, 
unfortunately, 'cause it's already rolled.

899
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,774
LIAM: But can she suss him out?

900
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:03,041
MATT: Best you can tell, those
who are looking into it,

901
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,988
he seems to be speaking
from a point of desperation,

902
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,425
and intent, as he has no other option.

903
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,105
He is genuinely--

904
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,886
You can see it in the way he talks,

905
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:16,480
and the way he speaks about his family.

906
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,669
He's a little crazy.

907
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:21,184
The isolation has put him to a point

908
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,472
where he wants to return to his people,

909
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,695
and will do whatever it
takes to get back with them,

910
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,112
however, he also seems to be,

911
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:33,746
in a weird way that you can read,

912
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:36,324
appreciative that you're willing to help,

913
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:39,491
and seems to be, on his part, genuine.

914
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:44,112
As a note, music's not playing?

915
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:46,259
I don't know if there's a reason for that.

916
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:49,566
TRAVIS: Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes,

917
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:52,263
are what put people in
trances, or their minds?

918
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,681
SAM: Yeah, the eyes, the eyes.

919
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,845
TRAVIS: So if we wear helmets,
it's not gonna help us.

920
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:58,572
SAM: No, the helmet is what separates
him from his hive mind.

921
00:40:58,572 --> 00:40:59,837
It wouldn't help us at all.

922
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,685
TRAVIS: I'll still wear the big
bronze pot on my head.

923
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:03,888
MATT: You put the pot on your head.
It's clunky.

924
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:04,976
TRAVIS: On my whole head.

925
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,402
MATT: You cannot see with the pot on your head.

926
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:08,314
TRAVIS: No, but I'm protected from the flayer.

927
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:10,437
SAM: Can you bore two like, ghost holes in?

928
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:13,642
TRAVIS: I don't need it, I have
incredible warrior skills.

929
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:17,280
TALIESIN: Do their powers work with reflection?

930
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,413
MATT: "No, they can peer into your very mind."

931
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:27,198
TALIESIN: But if we approach them
using a reflective surface

932
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:29,823
to view them, can they peer into our minds

933
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,707
through a reflected surface?

934
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:34,714
MATT: "If they know you're
there, you're in sight,

935
00:41:34,714 --> 00:41:36,545
"they can read into you."

936
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,378
TRAVIS: Shit.

937
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:39,979
MARISHA: They can read our minds.

938
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:44,146
MATT: "If you are obscured, unknown to
them, then you are hidden.

939
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:50,039
"They cannot sense you, but
if they know you are there,

940
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,372
"they can peer, they can pry."

941
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:57,788
LIAM: Is there any way to be hidden for us?

942
00:41:57,788 --> 00:41:59,455
MATT: "Hidden from sight.

943
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:03,556
"Be hidden from knowledge.

944
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:05,223
"Be hidden from them."

945
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,857
MARISHA: Clarence?

946
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:12,327
Sorry, Clarota.

947
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:13,744
SAM: How about Clay?

948
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:16,524
MATT: "Clarota!"

949
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:18,323
TRAVIS: Jesus.

950
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:20,233
MARISHA: Sorry, Clarota.

951
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,816
I just have one quick question.

952
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,265
Why would you want to rejoin your colony

953
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:29,515
after they've banished you?

954
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:31,558
Why not leave?

955
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:34,717
MATT: "I have nowhere to go.

956
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:38,085
"They are my essence, my connection.

957
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:39,502
"I long to return.

958
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:43,223
"It is the way of my people,

959
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:46,052
"I understand this curse I hold.

960
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:50,999
"I spite myself, I look upon this disease,
and spit.

961
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:52,711
"But perhaps,

962
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,563
"with this deed, they can overlook it."

963
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:01,670
MARISHA: You're not diseased, you're special.

964
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,503
TRAVIS: Oh, God.

965
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:05,964
SAM: Question, Clarota.

966
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:08,714
MATT: "You know nothing of my culture.

967
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:12,186
"You presume too much."

968
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,836
LIAM: I think we do understand
your desires though,

969
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:23,926
and we can align ours with yours.

970
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:27,563
So let us speak of specifics, Clarota.

971
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,396
SAM: Strategy.

972
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:30,041
LIAM: Strategy.

973
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,958
SAM: Number one, that assortment of

974
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:36,912
dwarves and some of your friends

975
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:39,519
and ogres over there on the
other side of the chasm.

976
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,104
Is that something that we
need to face headlong,

977
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,087
or can we maybe surpass them,

978
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:48,254
trying to find K'varn, or this
temple that you speak of?

979
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,476
MATT: "We may if you wish.

980
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,628
"Their stronghold is far below.

981
00:43:57,288 --> 00:44:00,378
"The magma leads the way.

00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:05,080
"However, if I know what I've seen,

"the general resides in that camp.

00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:12,550
"I know no way within the stronghold,

985
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,217
"without the brunt of their army.

986
00:44:17,005 --> 00:44:21,088
"Perhaps the general can be
pried for information.

987
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:26,488
"If you bring him to me."

988
00:44:26,488 --> 00:44:30,154
SAM: "Bring him," so you won't be 
accompanying us on any adventure, or...?

989
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:31,716
MATT: "I will be coming."

990
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,074
ORION: We have to fetch him.

991
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:37,317
SAM: And the general is in that...

992
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:38,822
ORION: Where you were, right?

993
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:39,722
SAM: Yes, yes.

994
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:41,718
So we have to go over.

995
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:44,623
ASHLEY: Did you say something about a temple,

996
00:44:44,623 --> 00:44:46,607
or did I completely misunderstand?

997
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:49,599
MATT: "There is a temple in our city.

998
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,766
"Where my people reside, that
is where the Elder Brain sits."

999
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:56,984
SAM: We'll get there eventually,

1000
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:59,997
but first step is this smaller
force across the chasm.

1001
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,007
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down.

1002
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:03,514
(all laugh)

1003
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,701
ORION: Well said, Grog.

1004
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,901
MARISHA: You said there was a big army front,

1005
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:09,609
guarding this general?

1006
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:10,863
Of duergar?

1007
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,659
SAM: Well, the general's right across the chasm.

1008
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:16,429
MARISHA: Oh, he's just right across the way?

1009
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:19,390
MATT: "Their forces are gathering there.
The bulk of their army

1010
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,547
"currently is divided between that
and the stronghold below."

1011
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:26,530
LIAM: Percy shot this one, I think.

1012
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,376
TALIESIN: I did.

1013
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:29,018
LIAM: I think it's important to point out

1014
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,975
that your kin, this general,

1015
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:34,144
is aware of at least three of us,

1016
00:45:34,144 --> 00:45:38,311
of my dragonborn friend, the
singer over here, and myself.

1017
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,114
SAM: I don't think he knows about me.

1018
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,664
TRAVIS: No, you were invisible.
LIAM: Just us, then.

1019
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:46,361
ORION: I don't even know if he saw me.

1020
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:48,118
He saw my funny cards.

1021
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:50,868
LIAM: True, it could be just me then.

1022
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:55,990
ORION: Oh, I cast Prestidigitation on Pike
and I clean her up real quick.

1023
00:45:56,952 --> 00:45:58,970
LIAM: You look lovely.

1024
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,771
How do you think your
kin will react to that?

1025
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:06,463
What will their response be
if they know that outsiders have come?

1026
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,616
If they've seen just me at this moment,

1027
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:10,533
plus a few illusions.

1028
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:14,161
MATT: "They will be prepared.

1029
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,828
"So you must find another way in.

1030
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:22,830
"You must think how to not be seen."

1031
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:25,145
TRAVIS: Think.

1032
00:46:25,145 --> 00:46:26,658
(all laugh)

1033
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,325
ORION: Don't worry, Grog.

1034
00:46:29,225 --> 00:46:31,138
MATT: You've never ever, in your life,

1035
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:35,614
ever heard someone else
chuckle inside your brain,

1036
00:46:35,614 --> 00:46:37,675
but you hear within the center of yours:

1037
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:42,742
(chuckles) "Think, yes."

1038
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:44,881
TRAVIS: Oh ho, it echoes in the pot.

1039
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,082
(all laugh)

1040
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:49,666
But I start laughing to myself.
(silly laughter)

1041
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:52,987
LIAM: Can I assume that you
would have already given us

1042
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:55,987
any advice by now if you knew a way?

1043
00:46:57,736 --> 00:47:00,736
Are we stuck with our own resources?

1044
00:47:01,627 --> 00:47:04,240
MATT: "I've only watched from a distance.

1045
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,862
"Getting too close was too dangerous.

1046
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,279
"I only read surface thoughts.

1047
00:47:10,214 --> 00:47:13,047
"If I were seen, I would be nothing,

1048
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:16,288
"I would be destroyed."

1049
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:18,838
LIAM: So no back doors, no secret
entrances that you know of,

1050
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:20,858
into the camp, anywhere near this general?

1051
00:47:20,858 --> 00:47:22,909
MATT: "None."

1052
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:25,147
LIAM: Fuck.

1053
00:47:25,147 --> 00:47:27,483
TRAVIS: What's in the bottom of the crevasse?

1054
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:29,080
SAM: It's water and magma.

1055
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,572
TRAVIS: Can we pick up the little loch ness monster

1056
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:32,198
and throw it at him or something?

1057
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:36,265
SAM: Oh yes, down below, in the waters,

1058
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,828
our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody.

1059
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:41,144
(all laugh)

1060
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:43,778
Found some creatures under the water,

1061
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,278
snatching bodies as they fell.

1062
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,001
Keyleth.

1063
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,575
Yes, I forgot who went.

1064
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,105
ORION: Her majesty, Keyleth.

1065
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:53,344
SAM: Pike's beauty distracted me,

1066
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:55,513
you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice.

1067
00:47:55,513 --> 00:47:56,903
ORION: I'm sorry.

1068
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:58,839
SAM: Anyway, there were some creatures

1069
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:00,254
down below in the waters,

1070
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:02,162
are those anything that we could use,

1071
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:03,914
or should we just avoid them?

1072
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,768
MATT: You see it actually hisses for a second,

1073
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:07,532
as soon as you mention this he goes,

1074
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:08,449
"No, avoid.

1075
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:11,155
"That creature is older than all of us.

1076
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,738
"It resides there, an ancient mind.

1077
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:17,030
"One that should be

1078
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:19,626
"Kept at bay.

1079
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:22,397
"An aboleth."

1080
00:48:22,397 --> 00:48:24,107
SAM: Do you need a lozenge?

1081
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:26,720
(all laugh)

1082
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,050
MATT: Its eyes narrow once again,

1083
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,720
not quite understanding the words you use,

1084
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,880
seemingly amused.

1085
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,477
SAM: It's a gnome thing.

1086
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,359
MATT: As a brief aside, too,

1087
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:36,293
I checked the connection on my iPad,

1088
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:38,382
I'm playing music fine, and
the connection's in the iPad,

1089
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,253
I don't quite know where
it's losing its connection.

1090
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,086
But I think we need some music.

1091
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:46,620
SAM: All right, so let's review
our options, shall we?

1092
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,001
TRAVIS: We're gonna charge in there.

1093
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,316
SAM: We can't charge, there's a chasm.

1094
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:51,764
LIAM: How did that go with
the little brain thing?

1095
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:52,736
Not too well.

1096
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:55,307
TALIESIN: The chasm is a problem.

1097
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,474
SAM: Master switch.

1098
00:48:59,832 --> 00:49:02,656
MARISHA: An entire colony of mind flayers.

1099
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,754
SAM: We could fly in, right?

1100
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,771
LIAM: The bridge is gone, we have to--

1101
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:10,018
SAM: We can fly in death from above.

1102
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:11,461
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can.

1103
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:13,260
SAM: Well, we can figure out a way.

1104
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,274
Enough of us can turn into flying things

1105
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:16,121
to get you there.

1106
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,092
TALIESIN: We also have a flying carpet.

1107
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,541
We can repair the bridge if we had to,

1108
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,525
at least put a rope across.

1109
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:21,525
ASHLEY: I think--

1110
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,140
SAM: Or we could disguise ourselves somehow.

1111
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,529
ASHLEY: I think I know where we need to go.

1112
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:30,538
SAM: What?

1113
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:31,371
TRAVIS: Really?

1114
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:33,315
MARISHA: Really?

1115
00:49:34,225 --> 00:49:36,142
LIAM: Get out of this city.

1116
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,729
MARISHA: Please, do tell.

1117
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:39,627
SAM: So, hold on--

1118
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:42,321
(static)

1119
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:44,721
(music)

1120
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:45,654
MATT: There we go.

1121
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:46,987
SAM: There's music.

1122
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:58,174
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I think I read this wrong.

1123
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:00,037
(all laugh)

1124
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:01,867
SAM: Pike, don't toy with our emotions.

1125
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:03,253
TRAVIS: You just got back.

1126
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,250
ASHLEY: So you guys haven't gone to the war camp.

1127
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,083
SAM: We have.

1128
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,052
ASHLEY: You have.

1129
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,697
SAM: We been there and we quickly retreated.

1130
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:11,232
LIAM: Scanlan took a poke about.

1131
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:15,094
He boofed himself out of sight
and had a look around,

1132
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:17,706
and then we returned to the edge of it,

1133
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:19,668
and I kind of flipped the bird at them,

1134
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:20,850
and taunted them a little,

1135
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,092
but most of us haven't been in.

1136
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:25,851
ASHLEY: Have you been to the lake?

1137
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,774
TRAVIS: None of us went in the water.

1138
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,648
SAM: Lake?

1139
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:30,663
No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?

1140
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:32,579
ASHLEY: Isn't that where that thing is?

1141
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,656
TRAVIS: The bottom of the crevasse, right?

1142
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,363
LIAM: Under the bridge, there was--

1143
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:38,548
SAM: No, that's rushing water, that's not--

1144
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:41,302
MATT: The area after the big drop
that was at the bottom,

1145
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:42,645
there was a lake of water.

1146
00:50:42,645 --> 00:50:44,923
And there was a waterfall
coming out of the natural--

1147
00:50:44,923 --> 00:50:48,072
LIAM: And the ogres were getting
sucked under by something.

1148
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:50,046
TRAVIS: So we didn't go down there.

1149
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,798
MARISHA: Is there something under the lake?

1150
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,131
ASHLEY: Well I just--

1151
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:56,082
I don't know if I should
be talking about this

1152
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:57,919
in front of him.

1153
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,941
TRAVIS: We could go away from him for a second.

1154
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:05,363
LIAM: He will probably hear the
thoughts inside your mind.

1155
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,245
ORION: Clarota is totally fine
to talk in front of. He's amazing.

1156
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:10,370
ASHLEY: Earmuffs.

1157
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,323
(all laugh)

1158
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:17,133
ASHLEY: Well, shall I share a vision I had?

1159
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:19,311
LIAM: I think so, Pike. I think at this point,

1160
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:21,983
we should just move forward.

1161
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,483
ASHLEY: In this vision that I had,

1162
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:29,611
I was pulled down toward the mines.

1163
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:35,195
Into the tunnels, below where
the dwarves were working.

1164
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:37,392
MARISHA: Through the lake?

1165
00:51:37,392 --> 00:51:40,071
ASHLEY: Well, past the goblinoid creatures,

1166
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:42,904
and past a great underground lake.

1167
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:48,772
Past a jagged onyx colored fortress,

1168
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,040
framed in molten rock.

1169
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,910
TRAVIS: We haven't been there yet.

1170
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,877
ASHLEY: Past a field of broken glass and bone.

1171
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,214
Have you seen any of this?

1172
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,501
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No.

1173
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,367
TRAVIS: I don't think an onyx fortress.

1174
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,163
ORION: Those last things sound terrible.

1175
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,375
LIAM: Yes, that all sounds shitty.

1176
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,208
(all laugh)

1177
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,008
LIAM: The last thing we've seen is the lake,

1178
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:07,393
and we didn't go too close to it,

1179
00:52:07,393 --> 00:52:10,365
because a couple of
ogres fell in from above,

1180
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:12,273
and they disappeared like
something grabbed them.

1181
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:14,660
TRAVIS: We didn't have him fly down there
and get a close look.

1182
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,708
LIAM: No, we haven't had a look around.

1183
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,405
ASHLEY: I wonder if there's like--

1184
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:20,716
MARISHA: I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.

1185
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:23,417
TRAVIS: Why don't we send one,
like Mars Rover over here,

1186
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,264
and have him go check it out?

1187
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:28,431
MARISHA: I can always turn into, like, a whale.

1188
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:31,650
LIAM: Perhaps, but the water
breathing sounds good to me.

1189
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,484
I feel like a head-on--

1190
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,978
TRAVIS: Isn't there something in the water?

1191
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,561
LIAM: -- run into the chasm is a bad idea.

1192
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:39,707
ORION: I pull out my empty bottle,

1193
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:40,932
and I go, and I have this!

1194
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:42,618
LIAM: Yes, he's got a bottle, plus,

1195
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,503
we've killed a fucking dragon.

1196
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:48,421
I know it's not an easy
task to accomplish,

1197
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,483
but we're pretty badass, I think.

1198
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:51,982
We might have a good chance.

1199
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:56,476
MARISHA: So wait, is going through the lake gonna
get us through to the general?

1200
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:57,917
LIAM: Well, we don't know.

1201
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:00,214
TRAVIS: We haven't been down
to the water's surface.

1202
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:01,555
SAM: What's the best-case scenario?

1203
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:02,991
What, we come up behind them?

1204
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,610
It's still gonna be a fight.

1205
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,735
TRAVIS: But maybe there's a
different vantage point.

1206
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:09,051
SAM: We can fly over them,

1207
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:10,952
that seems like a pretty
good attack point.

1208
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:12,732
TALIESIN: Some of us can fly over them.

1209
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,924
MARISHA: Well we can figure out
to where where all of us can fly over them.

1210
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:17,451
I'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves.

1211
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:19,443
Even if we're flying they're still
going to see us.

1212
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:21,602
SAM: There's an ancient death thing down there.

1213
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,549
TRAVIS: He might die, didn't say it was foolproof.

1214
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:25,366
SAM: I don't know, man, he's volunteering you.

1215
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:27,820
ORION: Wait, what's going on?

1216
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,160
LIAM: I mean, our options are:
we can vote on it,

1217
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,678
although we all know Keyleth is just

1218
00:53:30,678 --> 00:53:32,592
gonna go fucking do whatever she wants.

1219
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,733
Our options are--

1220
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,410
MARISHA: That was one time.

1221
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,523
LIAM: Just the one time.

1222
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:38,377
MARISHA: Just one time.

1223
00:53:38,377 --> 00:53:39,475
TRAVIS: Never to be forgotten.

1224
00:53:39,475 --> 00:53:41,341
LIAM: Our options are a headlong advance

1225
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:43,560
into the middle of their camp.

1226
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,385
That's a big fucking force.

1227
00:53:45,385 --> 00:53:48,077
SAM: Or some sort of disguise, distraction.

1228
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:48,910
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

1229
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:50,349
MATT: Is the stream down by the way?

1230
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:51,801
ZAC: It goes down every two hours

1231
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,609
and 17 minutes, it's
been doing that for--

1232
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:54,957
It comes right back up.

1233
00:53:54,957 --> 00:53:57,094
MATT: All right, so let us know when it's back up.

1234
00:53:57,094 --> 00:53:59,480
SAM: Two hours and 17 minutes,
that sounds like Lost or something.

1235
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,397
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

1236
00:54:00,397 --> 00:54:01,338
Do it.

1237
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,087
MARISHA: Amityville Twitch stream.

1238
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:05,560
TRAVIS: Go fly all the way down
to the water's surface.

1239
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,023
Like Michael J. Fox in
Back to the Future 2,

1240
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:12,106
and check out if there's any other tunnels

1241
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:13,909
that we haven't seen, or ways to go.

1242
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:16,241
ORION: Isn't this the same water that you bended?
MARISHA: I think so.

1243
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:18,709
TRAVIS: We didn't go down to the
water's surface though, did we?

1244
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:20,354
MARISHA: Well, we went over the top of it,

1245
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:21,840
and kind of looked down.

1246
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,940
TRAVIS: Oh, we did? We went all the way down?

1247
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,706
MARISHA: When I was bending the water back,

1248
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:27,101
we were kind of in that area, right?

1249
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:28,794
That was that area, but the lake--

1250
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:30,514
SAM: Do it smart.

1251
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,252
Let's go bomb them.

1252
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:33,700
ASHLEY: What if, I mean--

1253
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,923
TRAVIS: Can you freeze it?

1254
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,348
ASHLEY: Do you guys wanna like,
put me down on a rope,

1255
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:42,288
and I can just run around,
see if there's any openings?

1256
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:43,360
I mean I have a lot of armor.

1257
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,537
LIAM: Go fishing with you?

1258
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:45,956
MARISHA: Go fishing, yeah.

1259
00:54:45,956 --> 00:54:47,542
ASHLEY: Well no, just like halfway,

1260
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,709
and then I can run around
and look for tunnels.

1261
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,598
Well some of us can fly, so we're okay.

1262
00:54:51,598 --> 00:54:54,307
MARISHA: I can attempt to try and
drain the lake a little bit.

1263
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:57,112
LIAM: And Keyleth said that she
can cast Water Breathing,

1264
00:54:57,112 --> 00:54:58,966
can help us breathe
underneath the surface.

1265
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,340
TRAVIS: We have two underwater breathing potions.

1266
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,657
MARISHA: Control Water's a level five spell.

1267
00:55:01,657 --> 00:55:03,291
MATT: I realize that.
But that's a lot of water.

1268
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,944
TRAVIS: But remember, we're
slow as balls in water.

1269
00:55:04,944 --> 00:55:06,752
LIAM: You were having trouble, if I recall,

1270
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:08,912
just getting the waterfall
out of the way to create,

1271
00:55:08,912 --> 00:55:10,443
I mean it was amazing, but--

1272
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:11,475
MARISHA: I managed to get it stopped--

1273
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,330
LIAM: I know, you fucking saved the day,

1274
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,714
but we're talking about--

1275
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:15,557
MARISHA: A lake.

1276
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:16,873
LIAM: Yeah, Lake Superior.

1277
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:17,995
SAM: This is not just a lake,

1278
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:19,976
there is a death monster in there.

1279
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:22,165
If we go under the water, we're dead.

1280
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,348
TRAVIS: Can we stand on it?

1281
00:55:23,348 --> 00:55:24,671
Anything, if we wanna fight it?

1282
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,502
Or are we gonna be
fighting it in the water?

1283
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:28,248
TALIESIN: Well, we can all have Water Breathing.

1284
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:29,469
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we'll be slow.

1285
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:32,025
SAM: And we'll be underwater,
where there's a death monster.

1286
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:34,009
TRAVIS: I'm not worried about
that part of the question.

1287
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:37,389
LIAM: There's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top.

1288
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:39,706
SAM: Well, then let's come up with a good plan.

1289
00:55:39,706 --> 00:55:42,011
ASHLEY: Maybe there's hidden stairs
or something,

1290
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:43,305
like in Indiana Jones?

1291
00:55:43,305 --> 00:55:45,648
TRAVIS: Can you electrify the
water and fry the guy?

1292
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:47,247
LIAM: Hold up, hold up.

1293
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,344
ORION: There's only 26 people up there.

1294
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:51,359
On our last count.

1295
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,601
TALIESIN: Before the ones we killed, or after?
ORION: After.

1296
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,955
LIAM: Those are the ones we saw, though.

1297
00:55:55,955 --> 00:55:57,936
How do we know how far back the camp goes?

1298
00:55:57,936 --> 00:55:59,594
How many are in the gate behind it?

1299
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:01,809
TRAVIS: Don't a couple of you have Lightning?

1300
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:03,809
Can't you deep-fry the water?

1301
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,784
MARISHA: I mean, I can make a giant whirlpool.

1302
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:09,940
LIAM: Wait a second, wait a second.

1303
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,512
Clarota, you've been
listening to our thoughts

1304
00:56:12,512 --> 00:56:14,057
for the last ten minutes.

1305
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:16,974
SAM: And what clear thoughts they have been.

1306
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,394
LIAM: What do you think?

1307
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:20,464
What do you think?

1308
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:25,221
MATT: "What resides in that lake is

1309
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:29,518
"something you wish not to tamper with.
An ancient mind."

1310
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:30,921
TRAVIS: Blah blah blah.

1311
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,454
Hodie-fucking-ho.

1312
00:56:33,454 --> 00:56:36,753
MATT: "It clouds the water with its own filth.

1313
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:39,500
"You find yourself unable to breathe air."

1314
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,193
MARISHA: Didn't that happen already?

1315
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,326
MATT: "Its mind, it takes--"

1316
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:44,601
LIAM: Have you seen it?

1317
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,364
MATT: "Yes."

1318
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:47,520
LIAM: It's big?

1319
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,696
MATT: "It's rather large."

1320
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:54,391
ASHLEY: Is it like a many-armed

1321
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:55,801
...situation?

1322
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,819
(all laugh)

1323
00:56:57,819 --> 00:56:59,486
MATT: "One could say, yes."

1324
00:57:00,778 --> 00:57:01,778
ASHLEY: Okay. Swell.

1325
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:03,998
LIAM: What's the sitch?

1326
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:06,581
MARISHA: So we can face Cthulhu, or

1327
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,537
little Cthulhu minons,
seems to be our choice.

1328
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:13,370
ORION: Clarota.

1329
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,955
TRAVIS: Why don't I have Lightning, I swear.

1330
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,327
Can't you fry the water first?
See if it hurts it?

1331
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,060
SAM: We can fly overhead and just
Lightning the shit out of it.

1332
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,384
TRAVIS: Do that, please.

1333
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:23,514
'Cause maybe there's a
way-- there's a tunnel,

1334
00:57:23,514 --> 00:57:25,322
and we come up behind
them or whatever it was.

1335
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:29,563
LIAM: That illithid took out my
brain from like 100 feet.

1336
00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:32,267
SAM: You know what-- wait, wait, if I may.

1337
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:35,600
When I was there, I saw the main general

1338
00:57:37,863 --> 00:57:39,870
control all of them instantly,

1339
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,196
when he was about to make
a sacrifice, or feed,

1340
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:44,212
or whatever he was doing.

1341
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,336
No offense.

1342
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,503
He instantly had all of their command.

1343
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:52,594
If we could somehow get to him, and

1344
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,565
cut off that connection, distract him,

1345
00:57:55,565 --> 00:57:59,025
influence him somehow to
command them to all jump

1346
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:01,559
in the lake, for instance.

1347
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,110
That would get rid of a
lot of them all at once.

1348
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,376
LIAM: Can you make me invisible?

1349
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:08,116
SAM: I can get you there.

1350
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:11,834
I can make you unseeable,
but not invisible.

1351
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:12,805
LIAM: What?

1352
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,412
TRAVIS: What's the difference?

1353
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,085
SAM: I can make you a fly.

1354
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:18,397
TALIESIN: May I examine-- without removing--

1355
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:21,127
may I examine your device?

1356
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:21,960
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1357
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,122
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1358
00:58:23,122 --> 00:58:24,609
TRAVIS: Oh man, Percy, Percy.

1359
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:26,718
SAM: What's he doing?

1360
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:27,831
ORION: He's asking to--

1361
00:58:27,831 --> 00:58:28,664
TALIESIN: 16.

1362
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,987
LIAM: What's he doing?

1363
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,111
SAM: Touching the hat.

1364
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:34,548
MATT: He glares at you and says,

1365
00:58:34,548 --> 00:58:38,715
"Our agreement does not
include this interaction."

1366
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:45,377
TALIESIN: It may be the key to
returning you to your people.

1367
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:46,699
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

1368
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:47,532
ORION: Yes?

1369
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:49,412
TRAVIS: Would you go fry the fucking lake?

1370
00:58:49,412 --> 00:58:51,165
TALIESIN: I won't touch. I will just look.

1371
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:53,583
ORION: I'm reading my book.

1372
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,862
TRAVIS: No, I want you to--

1373
00:58:55,862 --> 00:58:58,505
MATT: It kind of bows its head,
but does not move closer.

1374
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:02,205
It just slightly shows
you an element of it.

1375
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,743
TALIESIN: Can I understand how it functions?

1376
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,388
MATT: Best you can tell

1377
00:59:08,388 --> 00:59:11,842
it looks like a skullcap
that's been kind of

1378
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:13,458
decently made for what it is,

1379
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,754
but you can see some of
the hammer marks on it,

1380
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:18,421
or whatever it was put together.

1381
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:25,516
It appears to be a very simple
piece of metallic material.

1382
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:27,002
TALIESIN: So it's magic.

1383
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:29,431
MATT: It looks like it is some
sort of enchantment,

1384
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:31,113
probably what's causing the effect.

1385
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:34,332
It's not any mechanical
device that causes it.

1386
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:36,866
TRAVIS: (metal clanging)

1387
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:39,963
TALIESIN: So there'd be no way to
build something to create a feedback loop?

1388
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:42,905
MARISHA: Ooh.

1389
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:46,271
I see what you're getting at.

1390
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:49,141
TALIESIN: I wanna try and see if there's any way
that I can take a look at this

1391
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:51,210
and figure out a way to build some sort

1392
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,404
of feedback system.

1393
00:59:52,404 --> 00:59:54,022
MARISHA: We need to build a coconut radio.

1394
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:55,995
SAM: We don't even have a laboratory.

1395
00:59:55,995 --> 00:59:58,398
TALIESIN: He wants a coconut radio.

1396
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:00,028
ORION: I love coconuts.

1397
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,887
MATT: You have never interacted with 
anything psionic-based before.

1398
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:06,545
The time to research that,

1399
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:09,781
and the materials needed
to do it would take months.

1400
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:11,991
TALIESIN: Plan two--

1401
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,154
LIAM: This is a fairly shitty situation.

1402
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:15,755
TRAVIS: While all this is going on!

1403
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:18,255
TALIESIN: Because if they can't see,

1404
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:19,255
what if we blind them?

1405
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:20,468
LIAM: How?

1406
01:00:20,468 --> 01:00:22,276
MARISHA: With some sort of interference?

1407
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:24,735
TALIESIN: With a really bright light.

1408
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:26,850
ORION: Oh, I love doing light things.

1409
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,969
TALIESIN: What if they are so blind
they can't actually see us coming?

1410
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:32,918
MARISHA: I believe Pike and I both have
access to spells like that.

1411
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:35,403
SAM: I assume that would make
us pretty blind as well.

1412
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:37,280
MARISHA: Not necessarily.

1413
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,898
ASHLEY: Not if we wear our--

1414
01:00:38,898 --> 01:00:40,634
SAM: -- sunglasses?

1415
01:00:40,634 --> 01:00:42,371
(all laugh)

1416
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:44,698
TALIESIN: Can I attempt to build sunglasses?

1417
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:47,127
SAM: Before we build sunglasses--

1418
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:49,115
MATT: You can probably make a couple

1419
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:50,968
with the materials you have on hand.

1420
01:00:50,968 --> 01:00:53,238
You are limited when
it comes to resources,

1421
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:55,320
as you are currently halfway underground.

1422
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,487
TALIESIN: Even better.

1423
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,795
TRAVIS: Vax could show his ass,
that's a pretty white light.

1424
01:00:58,795 --> 01:01:00,233
TALIESIN: That's as white as it gets.

1425
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:02,030
LIAM: It's pale as shit. When I go to the beach,

1426
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,425
I don't tan, I stroke.

1427
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:06,234
SAM: But I thought we established that 
they don't need visual contact to influence us,

1428
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:08,567
they just need to be able to be aware--

1429
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,495
TALIESIN: Once they have visual contact
they can influence us,

1430
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,669
but they need to make that visual contact

1431
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:15,081
in the first place.

1432
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,664
MATT: "The dark, deep dwarves,

1433
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:21,948
"they hate light. This I know."

1434
01:01:21,962 --> 01:01:23,839
MARISHA: I think it'll stun them long enough

1435
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,951
for us to get across.

1436
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:27,078
TALIESIN: If we could perhaps put some Light spells

1437
01:01:27,078 --> 01:01:28,827
on the back and the front of our shields,

1438
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:31,038
so that we are guarded from it.

1439
01:01:31,038 --> 01:01:33,779
ORION: If you can make a pair
for our friend here,

1440
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:35,451
that would help him out, I assume.

1441
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,580
MARISHA: Wait, that's not a bad idea.

1442
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,247
Pike, can we temporarily enchant

1443
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:45,125
the magic carpet as a spotlight

1444
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,375
as we fly over?

1445
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,109
As a light death ray?

1446
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:53,941
LIAM: We've seen you surrounded
in radiant light before,

1447
01:01:53,941 --> 01:01:56,195
you think you can do that to the carpet?

1448
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:58,051
ASHLEY: I mean, I have--

1449
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,794
MARISHA: We should have Daylight.

1450
01:01:59,794 --> 01:02:01,800
Where's my book?

1451
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,780
Where's my Player's Handbook?

1452
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,589
LIAM: And Clarota, while
they're figuring that out,

1453
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:10,589
if we remain to be hidden
or blind our opponents

1454
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,450
as we approach your kin,

1455
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:18,221
will not know our
thoughts 'til they see us?

1456
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:19,054
MATT: "Yes.

1457
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:24,819
"They need to look into you,
by knowing you're there."

1458
01:02:27,462 --> 01:02:31,629
LIAM: Can I fight one of your
kin with a blindfold on?

1459
01:02:33,381 --> 01:02:34,214
MATT: "Perhaps."

1460
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,144
TRAVIS: I thought if they could see you--

1461
01:02:40,144 --> 01:02:40,977
ORION: Clarota.

1462
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,557
The mind hive that you possess,

1463
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:48,749
how close can one be
before it actually affects?

1464
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:51,813
Say 100 feet, caught my friend in mid air,

1465
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,146
alas, in their run-in.

1466
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,958
Is its range about--?

1467
01:02:57,675 --> 01:02:59,832
MATT: "That's about the distance, yes."

1468
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,067
SAM: You may not know the answer to this.

1469
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:09,193
I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom,

1470
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:13,227
but I happen to have a
ring with mind shielding,

1471
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,560
will that aid me in any way?

1472
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,875
MATT: "It may.

1473
01:03:17,925 --> 01:03:21,285
"If it gives you resistance to psionic influence,

1474
01:03:21,285 --> 01:03:24,742
"it would be of aid, yes."

1475
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:26,919
MARISHA: Daylight.

1476
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:28,339
TRAVIS: Do we have a plan?

1477
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:31,213
LIAM: It wouldn't be hard to get hold of

1478
01:03:31,213 --> 01:03:34,182
some pitch down here, some tar.

1479
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:35,327
SAM: To burn?

1480
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:36,650
LIAM: No.

1481
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,231
If you can be invisible,

1482
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,523
and you have a ring of mind shielding,

1483
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:43,660
and you can carry a bucket of
pitch to that motherfucker,

1484
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:47,105
you can splash it on its
face, cover its eyes,

1485
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:48,544
and it's helpless.

1486
01:03:49,384 --> 01:03:50,217
TALIESIN: My God.

1487
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:53,248
SAM: Or I can hang that big
brass pot on its head.

1488
01:03:53,248 --> 01:03:54,900
TRAVIS: But I'm wearing that.

1489
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,740
LIAM: Yes, but it could take it off, possibly.

1490
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,650
If you smear sticky shit on its eyes--

1491
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,725
SAM: So wait, I just have to blind it?

1492
01:04:01,725 --> 01:04:03,229
LIAM: Then it can't control--

1493
01:04:03,229 --> 01:04:05,841
SAM: Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell!

1494
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:09,884
MATT: "It may still try, but to be blind,

1495
01:04:09,884 --> 01:04:13,726
"it would be very difficult for it to pry
into your mind."

1496
01:04:17,768 --> 01:04:20,539
SAM: Could it still control the others, though?

1497
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:21,997
MATT: "Probably.

1498
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:25,696
"That is a permanent enslavement."

1499
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:28,050
SAM: So you want me to go in there, solo,

1500
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,077
invisible, and try to blind this thing.

1501
01:04:30,077 --> 01:04:31,070
LIAM: No, not solo.

1502
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,143
SAM: I'm in!

1503
01:04:32,143 --> 01:04:35,947
LIAM: I like your idea of turning me into a fly.

1504
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:37,277
You and I go in--

1505
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,537
TALIESIN: And we've got Light spells.

1506
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:43,704
MARISHA: Pike and I can cast Daylight
on our magic carpet.

1507
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:48,402
ASHLEY: I can cast it onto my shield,

1508
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:51,943
and then on the carpet, and
we would have a double--

1509
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:53,483
MARISHA: I have to take a nap, though.

1510
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:56,770
What's that?

1511
01:04:57,847 --> 01:05:00,117
LIAM: But that could get us in close.

1512
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:02,544
Scanlan and I could get in closer,

1513
01:05:02,544 --> 01:05:05,942
and blind it, and I could
stab it in the head.

1514
01:05:05,942 --> 01:05:08,583
MARISHA: I mean, technically I can also turn into 
something flying,

1515
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,562
I could back you guys up,

1516
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,998
if someone else wants to take the carpet.

1517
01:05:12,998 --> 01:05:14,982
SAM: We can all get there.

1518
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:16,367
We can all get there.

1519
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:18,947
MARISHA: I can cast Daylight on your helmet.

1520
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,315
On your pot helmet.

1521
01:05:20,315 --> 01:05:22,427
TRAVIS: Really?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1522
01:05:22,427 --> 01:05:24,040
TRAVIS: That I'm game with

1523
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,311
MARISHA: All right.

1524
01:05:25,311 --> 01:05:28,066
TRAVIS: I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around.

1525
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:29,488
Crushing life.

1526
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:30,488
(all laugh)

1527
01:05:30,488 --> 01:05:33,122
MATT: You'd be the cover of 
John Carpenter's "The Thing."

1528
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:36,817
LIAM: Did everyone hear Percy,
that's a good idea.

1529
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:37,748
TALIESIN: Two fronts.

1530
01:05:37,748 --> 01:05:39,033
LIAM: Yes, two fronts.

1531
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:39,866
SAM: What is it?

1532
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:41,822
LIAM: You and I separate from the group,

1533
01:05:41,822 --> 01:05:43,910
they go in shining like a beacon,

1534
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,031
you and I (buzzes) in,

1535
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:50,870
and while the illithid is focused on them,

1536
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:54,337
we go in, you blind him,
and I stab him in his maw.

1537
01:05:55,233 --> 01:05:56,139
It's pretty good.

1538
01:05:56,139 --> 01:05:57,986
SAM: That's a suicide mission.

1539
01:05:57,986 --> 01:05:59,771
TRAVIS: I like it, let's do it.

1540
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,720
LIAM: What else are we going to do?

1541
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,213
TALIESIN: I'm behind this plan.

1542
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,873
SAM: Surgical, special ops, seal team six.

1543
01:06:06,873 --> 01:06:08,813
MARISHA: What does Vax have to say about this?

1544
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:10,932
LIAM: Vex, you mean? My sister Vex?

1545
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:11,765
MARISHA: Yes, that one.

1546
01:06:11,765 --> 01:06:12,598
LIAM: That's a good question.

1547
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:14,221
SAM: Oh, Vex, you look so tired.

1548
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,438
MATT: Vex, your sister seems genuinely perturbed

1549
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:18,998
by the circumstance, but looks to you and says,

1550
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,785
"Look, I found him, you
deal with the situation.

1551
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,278
"Just tell me what to do."

1552
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:27,117
SAM: She's so like that.

1553
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:29,367
(all laugh)

1554
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:32,860
ASHLEY Let's do it.

1555
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,573
LIAM: I gave up trying to
understand her years ago.

1556
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,165
MARISHA: Do you know what time it is?

1557
01:06:37,165 --> 01:06:39,578
I'm feeling a bit nappy.

1558
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,149
ORION: Your hair looks fine.

1559
01:06:41,149 --> 01:06:43,331
LIAM: Well, I--
SAM: Wait-- (shushes)

1560
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:46,553
MATT: "If you need rest, then rest.

1561
01:06:46,553 --> 01:06:49,303
"Time of day has no bearing down here."

1562
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:52,885
MARISHA: I have to rest so I can--

1563
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:56,055
I'm gonna read up on this Daylight spell,

1564
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:59,034
so that you and me can both cast it.

1565
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:01,274
ASHLEY Yeah, we'll just take a nap and just get,

1566
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:04,981
you know, rest our muscles,
and get ready for the fight.

1567
01:07:06,658 --> 01:07:09,490
TRAVIS: I'm gonna read up
on this Chopping Head spell.

1568
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,899
Yep, I'm read up.

1569
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:13,495
SAM: I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire

1570
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:16,488
a couple of my allies here, if I can.

1571
01:07:16,488 --> 01:07:18,452
MATT: Okay, I would recommend
doing it after rest.

1572
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,238
The dice would go away while they rest.

1573
01:07:20,238 --> 01:07:21,180
SAM: Okay, forget it.

1574
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,097
MARISHA: I go ahead and I light an incense

1575
01:07:24,097 --> 01:07:27,925
in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow.

1576
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,092
That's better. That's nice.

1577
01:07:30,207 --> 01:07:32,527
TALIESIN: I'm gonna do a little bit of work

1578
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:34,549
on that first trick arrow.

1579
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:35,954
On the trap arrow.

1580
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:37,548
Since I've got a little time.

1581
01:07:37,548 --> 01:07:39,235
MATT: Go ahead and make a roll.

1582
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:40,318
TALIESIN: That's a--

1583
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,288
What am I rolling?

1584
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:44,879
MATT: Your engineering-- your tinker's kit.

1585
01:07:44,879 --> 01:07:47,223
TALIESIN: Oh, it's just an intelligence roll, right?

1586
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:48,632
MATT: Plus your tinker's kit proficiency.

1587
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,973
It's down underneath your skills.

1588
01:07:50,973 --> 01:07:53,075
Proficiency, at the very bottom left.

1589
01:07:53,075 --> 01:07:55,388
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't have a number for that.

1590
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:58,190
MATT: You can add your proficiency modifier
to your intelligence check.

1591
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,957
Add your intelligence modifier plus four.

1592
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:02,290
TALIESIN: Ah, thank you.

1593
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,266
17.

1594
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:06,919
MATT: All right, and so what are
you trying to accomplish

1595
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:07,952
with this arrow again?

1596
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:10,250
TALIESIN: I was just trying to make
an entanglement arrow.

1597
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,153
It's a trapper's arrow.

1598
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:13,267
MATT: Okay.

1599
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:16,497
You manage to work out what
seems like a tanglefoot bag-type

1600
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:19,011
detonation, where if an arrow were fired,

1601
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,005
it would be a grapple check
against the individual,

1602
01:08:21,005 --> 01:08:22,658
probably give them
penalties until they're able

1603
01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:24,193
to break free of the grapple.

1604
01:08:24,193 --> 01:08:25,587
So yeah, success on that one.

1605
01:08:25,587 --> 01:08:27,291
TRAVIS: Nice job, Doogie.

1606
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:29,607
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing
Laura out at some point,

1607
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:30,720
I got a couple of them.

1608
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,312
ORION: Before I retire, Clarota,

1609
01:08:32,312 --> 01:08:35,187
you said you wanted to
speak with me later.

1610
01:08:35,187 --> 01:08:36,434
Anything in particular,

1611
01:08:36,434 --> 01:08:39,254
or you wish to save it for after the battle?

1612
01:08:39,254 --> 01:08:40,638
MATT: "Perhaps after.

1613
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:43,953
"I just am curious about the source

1614
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,899
"of your Arcane power."

1615
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:47,493
ORION: Ooh, I'd be happy to discuss it.

1616
01:08:47,493 --> 01:08:51,161
I could learn a great
deal from you as well.

1617
01:08:52,978 --> 01:08:53,943
MATT: "Later."

1618
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:55,765
ORION: Later, of course.

1619
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,750
I go to my books.

1620
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,113
MATT: So Clarota closes his eyes,

1621
01:08:59,113 --> 01:09:01,337
and kind of goes into a meditative stance.

1622
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,693
The rest of you, those
who have spells to choose,

1623
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:05,940
go ahead and choose
your spells accordingly

1624
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,066
for the next day.

1625
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:08,066
TRAVIS: Rub it in.

1626
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:10,381
I'm sharpening my ax.

1627
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:11,908
MATT: Good. Good.

1628
01:09:11,908 --> 01:09:13,207
TRAVIS: It is good.

1629
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:15,345
SAM: Just doing my vocal warmups.

1630
01:09:15,345 --> 01:09:18,729
♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫

1631
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:19,970
MARISHA: I'm meditating.

1632
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:23,075
SAM: ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, 
molto bene, molto bene ♫

1633
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,779
TRAVIS: The human torch was denied a bank loan.

1634
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:28,029
(all laugh)

1635
01:09:30,447 --> 01:09:33,608
MATT: So as you all have your evening's rest...

1636
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,017
Not very comfortable.

1637
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:37,021
Number one, you're in the middle of a tent

1638
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:38,923
of a goblinoid city. Second,

1639
01:09:38,923 --> 01:09:42,064
just the general proximity
of sleeping near an illithid,

1640
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:45,455
you just have a general
sense of unsettling dreams,

1641
01:09:45,455 --> 01:09:47,513
imagery that is disturbing.

1642
01:09:48,493 --> 01:09:52,138
Pike, you have many flashbacks
to the vision you had,

1643
01:09:52,138 --> 01:09:54,145
and actually wake partway through the night

1644
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:55,251
in a cold sweat.

1645
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:59,076
As you wake up, you all
kind of slowly come to,

1646
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:01,230
it's about four hours
into the evening's rest.

1647
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,650
You feel a slight tremor,

1648
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,409
a familiar tremor that
you felt once before in this cavern.

1649
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,719
(rumbling)

1650
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,660
You feel the ground begin
to vibrate and shake.

1651
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,910
TALIESIN: I get up and look around.

1652
01:10:12,995 --> 01:10:14,328
SAM: Is Clay awake?

1653
01:10:15,331 --> 01:10:16,815
(all laugh)

1654
01:10:16,815 --> 01:10:18,580
MATT: Eyes are open, just sitting there.

1655
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,787
SAM: Clarota, do you know
what that rumbling is?

1656
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:24,379
MATT: "There are many creatures
that live in this rock.

1657
01:10:24,379 --> 01:10:25,879
"You'd best be still."

1658
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,331
SAM: Ooh, still.

1659
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:29,164
MATT: "Still."

1660
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:31,957
ORION: Don't move.

1661
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:33,707
TRAVIS: So, vocal warm ups.

1662
01:10:34,639 --> 01:10:36,402
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check.

1663
01:10:36,402 --> 01:10:37,235
MARISHA: Oh!

1664
01:10:37,235 --> 01:10:38,535
TRAVIS: Fucking nipples.

1665
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:39,355
MARISHA: Pooper.

1666
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,870
TRAVIS: We get advantage on that, right?

1667
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:46,259
MATT: Nope!

1668
01:10:46,259 --> 01:10:47,092
ORION: 16.

1669
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:49,576
SAM: 14.

1670
01:10:49,576 --> 01:10:50,675
MARISHA: 19.
TALIESIN: 18.

1671
01:10:50,675 --> 01:10:51,592
LIAM: 20.

1672
01:10:51,592 --> 01:10:52,729
ASHLEY: One.

1673
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:53,866
TRAVIS: One.

1674
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:55,003
(all laugh)

1675
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:56,232
MATT: Two natural ones?

1676
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:57,383
TRAVIS: Yup!

1677
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,492
SAM: After her two natural 20's.

1678
01:10:59,492 --> 01:11:00,745
LIAM: Nothing to add.

1679
01:11:00,745 --> 01:11:02,441
ASHLEY: Nothing to add.

1680
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,166
Well I'm new to armor, you know.

1681
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,860
MATT: You both rolled natural ones.

1682
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,006
Those both count as two failures.

1683
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:08,939
ASHLEY: Fuck.

1684
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:11,958
MATT: Thankfully, the rest of your group
all rolled pretty high.

1685
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,544
So it was four versus five.

1686
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:14,708
ORION: Yes!

1687
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,935
MATT: You guys just barely succeed.

1688
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:19,105
As you all hold still, barely breathe,

1689
01:11:19,115 --> 01:11:20,657
the rumbling intensifies,

1690
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:23,157
and goes on for a good
minute, minute and a half,

1691
01:11:23,157 --> 01:11:25,048
before it eventually subsides.

1692
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:25,968
TRAVIS: Aw.

1693
01:11:25,968 --> 01:11:27,963
Thought we were gonna get a warm up.

1694
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:29,864
MATT: Fades into the distance.

1695
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:32,074
Rumbling is complete.

1696
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:34,044
It appears to be no issue.

1697
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,127
Clarota says,

1698
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:39,936
"Many of these creatures,
they pick up on movement,

1699
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:42,103
"in that sound, be wary."

1700
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:44,894
LIAM: What creatures are you speaking of now?

1701
01:11:44,894 --> 01:11:45,727
Is this something--

1702
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,354
SAM: The rumbling creatures.

1703
01:11:47,354 --> 01:11:49,076
LIAM: But what are they?

1704
01:11:49,076 --> 01:11:51,166
ORION: Probably buttholes.

1705
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,893
MATT: "I've only got glimpses."

1706
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:56,237
LIAM: This is something worse
than umberhulks, I assume.

1707
01:11:56,237 --> 01:11:57,404
MATT: "Larger, yes."

1708
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:00,854
SAM: All right, we've all rested up.

1709
01:12:00,854 --> 01:12:03,448
LIAM: Buttholes in the underdark!

1710
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,838
SAM: I had a crazy dream.

1711
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:08,333
It said if Geek &amp; Sundry got to 1,400 followers,

1712
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,659
there would be some sort of a giveaway.

1713
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,260
ORION: Oh, I had the same dream, Scanlan!

1714
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,084
SAM: Wow!

1715
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:15,984
MATT: Yeah guys, just so you're aware,

1716
01:12:15,984 --> 01:12:17,426
every 50 subscribers we get,

1717
01:12:17,426 --> 01:12:20,952
we are giving away an awesome
Geek &amp; Sundry game package.

1718
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:23,036
ZAC: Ethanmyhead just won one.

1719
01:12:23,036 --> 01:12:24,954
MATT: Oh, there you go, congratulations!

1720
01:12:24,954 --> 01:12:26,197
We already got a winner.

1721
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:28,955
We'll be putting those out for every 50
subscribers we get tonight.

1722
01:12:28,955 --> 01:12:31,570
We'll be choosing one to
win that awesome award,

1723
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:34,277
our wonderful package,
so keep that in mind.

1724
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:40,491
SAM: So the plan is again, you and I,

1725
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:43,309
stealth. The rest, attack with light?

1726
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:45,751
What's first, what's second,
what happens here?

1727
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:48,077
LIAM: Well, I need to take a moment to find some--

1728
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:51,115
I'm gonna look around and
see if I can find any pitch,

1729
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:52,760
anywhere in the goblin camp.

1730
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,460
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check.

1731
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,358
Actually, this would be investigation.

1732
01:12:57,358 --> 01:12:59,036
LIAM: Investigation.

1733
01:12:59,036 --> 01:13:01,703
I got the exact same number, 12.

1734
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:04,625
MATT: Takes about an hour.

1735
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,495
You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of

1736
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,237
rather disgusting,
sticky, goblinoid refuse,

1737
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:15,278
that you imagine will probably
stick and burn pretty well.

1738
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:16,788
In a pitch-type way, yeah.

1739
01:13:16,788 --> 01:13:17,838
LIAM: Goblin shit?

1740
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:20,308
MATT: You find just a whole
bunch of goblin shit.

1741
01:13:20,308 --> 01:13:22,742
LIAM: Let's cook it up a little.

1742
01:13:22,742 --> 01:13:25,194
TALIESIN: How do you feel about
lacing it with gun powder?

1743
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:26,787
SAM: I'll make some fire for you.

1744
01:13:26,787 --> 01:13:28,573
LIAM: Feel pretty good about that.

1745
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:31,421
MARISHA: Goblin molotov cocktails? I like that.

1746
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:32,963
TALIESIN: Goblin poop cocktail.

1747
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:35,298
LIAM: So here's how I think this goes.

1748
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:37,655
I think the team

1749
01:13:37,655 --> 01:13:40,333
infuses the carpet, and any shields,

1750
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,757
or head pots they have with radiant light.

1751
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,553
They go in and make a big
stink on the side of the camp.

1752
01:13:46,553 --> 01:13:48,330
You and I go in, you're invisible.

1753
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,855
I'm a--

1754
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:53,585
SAM: Fly, flea, mosquito,
dragonfly, whatever you'd like.

1755
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:55,335
LIAM: Yes, let's say fly.

1756
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,933
We go in, find the illithid, and then

1757
01:14:02,682 --> 01:14:03,682
we pop in,

1758
01:14:05,435 --> 01:14:07,540
you yell, "Hey, Spanky,"

1759
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,264
throw goblin shit in its face.

1760
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:12,207
SAM: Or I try to blind it with magic.

1761
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:13,322
LIAM: Yes.

1762
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:14,155
TALIESIN: Both.

1763
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:15,905
ORION: Both! Why not both?

1764
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:20,611
LIAM: We want to increase our odds.

1765
01:14:20,611 --> 01:14:24,278
As soon as he's blind,
I go in for the kill.

1766
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:28,710
And then it's on us to deal
with what happens after that.

1767
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,053
TRAVIS: It's playtime.

1768
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:31,313
LIAM: It's playtime.

1769
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,897
SAM: Might I suggest one other wrinkle.

1770
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:34,980
LIAM: Yes, please do.

1771
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,856
SAM: Remember there are some
dwarves being held captive.

1772
01:14:37,856 --> 01:14:40,052
We can make our way to
them and release them.

1773
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:42,063
TRAVIS: We don't need all of them, though.

1774
01:14:42,063 --> 01:14:43,724
Just to cause further distraction,

1775
01:14:43,724 --> 01:14:45,799
or to get some allies on the inside.

1776
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:48,597
LIAM: It's possible they could
be weary, frightened.

1777
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:49,430
TALIESIN: Mind controlled.

1778
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,776
LIAM: Seems unreliable-- yes, mind controlled.

1779
01:14:51,776 --> 01:14:53,929
TRAVIS: They're probably ready to fight, like me.

1780
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:55,361
(all laugh)

1781
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:58,786
SAM: Grog, we understand, you
want to bash some things.

1782
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,657
LIAM: Your time to kill is coming.

1783
01:15:00,657 --> 01:15:03,232
SAM: All right, is there anyone else in the party

1784
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,223
who could help us with stealth, or anything?

1785
01:15:06,223 --> 01:15:07,618
ASHLEY: Definitely not me.

1786
01:15:07,618 --> 01:15:08,451
SAM: Okay.

1787
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:09,504
TRAVIS: Clang clang.

1788
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:11,432
ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang.

1789
01:15:11,432 --> 01:15:14,449
MATT: As a note, just remember. 
Because you're the one who walked through.

1790
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:17,336
There is essentially a shanty town, 
a tent city of war tents.

1791
01:15:17,336 --> 01:15:18,646
With a few rock formations.

1792
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,881
You also notice that, or
you remember last time,

1793
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:24,742
that there was the main square
that had the raised platform.

1794
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:27,039
And then there was the
small stone barracks,

1795
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,019
where it seemed both the mind flayer

1796
01:15:29,019 --> 01:15:31,930
and the duergar general both went back in.

1797
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,765
SAM: So we gotta go into the barracks.

1798
01:15:33,765 --> 01:15:36,087
MATT: Well that's where you
saw at least they were

1799
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:37,240
last time you were there.

1800
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,016
LIAM: That's our starting point, I imagine.

1801
01:15:39,016 --> 01:15:40,412
ORION: Well, there's two targets.

1802
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:41,892
SAM: So we gotta get in, and then get in.

1803
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:43,618
LIAM: The main thing is to get the illithid,

1804
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:47,015
because if he's out, nobody's--

1805
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:49,859
Then they're all separate.

1806
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:52,303
He's playing chess with all his minions

1807
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:53,303
until we take him out.

1808
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:54,670
TRAVIS: I hate chess.

1809
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:56,886
ORION: So we all strike right on him.

1810
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,192
You two are going to
take that little journey.

1811
01:16:00,192 --> 01:16:02,501
The rest of us, what shall we do?

1812
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:05,627
I have many options and they're all fun.

1813
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:06,460
So Percy.

1814
01:16:07,884 --> 01:16:09,116
Your sniper rifle.

1815
01:16:09,116 --> 01:16:11,147
I should think that you want to post up

1816
01:16:11,147 --> 01:16:12,809
and start taking out position.

1817
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:15,052
TALIESIN: I'll do that at first, 
but then eventually

1818
01:16:15,052 --> 01:16:17,261
I'm going to just have to
jump into the fray.

1819
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:20,704
ORION: Yes, of course, onslaught
to the rest of the camp,

1820
01:16:20,704 --> 01:16:22,386
that we'll go about it too, right?

1821
01:16:22,386 --> 01:16:24,358
Make a bunch of noise, a bunch of light.

1822
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:27,906
SAM: How are you going to get Grog over there?

1823
01:16:27,906 --> 01:16:32,026
MARISHA: I'm gonna put a giant
sunlight beacon on his head,

1824
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:34,151
and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.

1825
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:36,348
LIAM: Yes, but there's no
bridge, we talked about--

1826
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:38,294
MARISHA: Oh, how are we gonna
get him over it?

1827
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,517
LIAM: We have an infinite amount of rope.

1828
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,352
SAM: How do we get it over there?

1829
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,875
LIAM: Tiberius talks about making
him light as a feather.

1830
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:46,340
TRAVIS: Or you can fly me.

1831
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,028
SAM: Yes, you can fly him, right?

1832
01:16:48,028 --> 01:16:49,350
ORION: Perhaps you can fly.

1833
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,902
TRAVIS: Why don't we turn my
pot into a lighthouse,

1834
01:16:51,902 --> 01:16:54,097
and then you fly me
over, and I'll do like,

1835
01:16:54,097 --> 01:16:56,097
abominable snow man walk.

1836
01:16:56,097 --> 01:16:57,773
MARISHA: I like that.

1837
01:16:57,773 --> 01:16:59,931
LIAM: Clarota, is there anything you can do

1838
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:02,141
to help us on this endeavor?

1839
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:08,330
MATT: "I can try to cloud his mind 
with mine,

1840
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:13,558
"but you have to swear
to protect me from harm."

1841
01:17:13,947 --> 01:17:15,609
LIAM: You have our word.

1842
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:17,670
SAM: -- that we will try.

1843
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,132
(all laugh)

1844
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:21,309
MATT: "Then I will come.

1845
01:17:22,257 --> 01:17:23,974
"You must work swiftly.

1846
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:28,897
"If we can leap most of the city,

1847
01:17:28,897 --> 01:17:31,139
"get to that barrack, storm it,

1848
01:17:31,139 --> 01:17:34,972
"and take out the mind flayer that resides."

1849
01:17:37,506 --> 01:17:40,852
SAM: Let's set down right in
the middle of the thing.

1850
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:43,333
MARISHA: Well I was gonna say,
can we set down where

1851
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:45,172
we're kind of backing you guys up,

1852
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:47,334
holding the fort down while you guys go?

1853
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,860
LIAM: There's no bridge.

1854
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,340
SAM: We all have to get there.

1855
01:17:50,345 --> 01:17:51,458
MARISHA: I'm not worried about that.

1856
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,919
LIAM: Get over together, get to the edge.

1857
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,731
SAM: Yes, but where are we going to make land?

1858
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:57,003
In the middle of the shit,
next to the barracks?

1859
01:17:57,003 --> 01:17:59,275
MARISHA: I say we might as well
go closest to the barracks as we can get.

1860
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:02,142
SAM: Okay, then you and I
can get in the barracks.

1861
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:05,355
LIAM: That's a good idea.
If we go as high as we can,

1862
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:07,939
and just hug the ceiling
of this motherfucker,

1863
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:09,441
and then go down in the middle.

1864
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:11,782
And as we're going down,

1865
01:18:11,782 --> 01:18:14,129
you turn me into a fly and go invisible,

1866
01:18:14,129 --> 01:18:16,234
and that's when all hell breaks lose.

1867
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,817
TRAVIS: I like that part.

1868
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:19,470
Let's do it.

1869
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,990
LIAM: No time like the present.

1870
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:22,452
TRAVIS: Hands up if you're in.

1871
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:25,079
MARISHA: I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.

1872
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:26,701
ORION: I cast Stoneskin.

1873
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,877
TALIESIN: Gonna be buffing us
like a vampire slayer.

1874
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:31,142
MARISHA: Oh! Joss Whedon
up in this bitch!

1875
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:33,286
SAM: Question to the dungeon master.

1876
01:18:33,286 --> 01:18:34,096
MATT: Yes.

1877
01:18:34,096 --> 01:18:36,527
SAM: I think my Polymorph spell
is a concentration spell.

1878
01:18:36,527 --> 01:18:37,360
MATT: It is, yes.

1879
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,857
SAM: I'm going solo.

1880
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:44,138
(sighs)

1881
01:18:44,138 --> 01:18:44,971
TRAVIS: Do it.

1882
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,370
SAM: I can get you in.

1883
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,645
I can make you a fly,

1884
01:18:47,645 --> 01:18:49,681
but I can't be invisible at the same time.

1885
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:51,598
LIAM: I will sneak through.

1886
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:57,239
If shit goes south, I will
peel off and join the others.

1887
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:00,250
MARISHA: Well, I can cast Pass
Without A Trace on myself,

1888
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,542
and as long as we hug close to me,

1889
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:05,155
there's an area around me
that's like a dark shadow.

1890
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,322
We get like, all stealthy.

1891
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:10,470
SAM: We're going in.

1892
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,042
LIAM: We're just gonna have to improvise that.

1893
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:13,474
We'll do it live, we'll do it live.

1894
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:15,174
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait! Don't go in yet.

1895
01:19:15,174 --> 01:19:16,492
Let me buff people.

1896
01:19:16,492 --> 01:19:17,811
MATT: You said you were casting Stoneskin?

1897
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:18,926
Stoneskin is concentration.

1898
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,121
The moment you cast another
concentration spell,

1899
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:21,204
it goes away.

1900
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:23,675
ORION: Oh, right.

1901
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:24,954
So I don't cast it, then.

1902
01:19:24,954 --> 01:19:27,204
(all laugh)

1903
01:19:29,093 --> 01:19:31,158
God damned concentration spells.

1904
01:19:31,158 --> 01:19:33,127
TRAVIS: I would like to cast, um.

1905
01:19:33,127 --> 01:19:35,377
(all laugh)

1906
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:38,095
TRAVIS: Blood Lust on myself.

1907
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:40,516
Blood Lust.

1908
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:44,266
MARISHA: I go ahead and I cast
Enhance Ability on Vex.

1909
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,330
ALL: Vax.

1910
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,552
LIAM: Sorry, everybody does it.

1911
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:51,536
Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.

1912
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:52,621
MATT: To increase his dexterity?

1913
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,040
MARISHA: To increase your dexterity.

1914
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,297
MATT: So essentially you have advantage

1915
01:19:56,297 --> 01:19:58,448
on dexterity-based checks, yeah.

1916
01:19:58,448 --> 01:19:59,783
MARISHA: Which is your stealth, right?

1917
01:19:59,783 --> 01:20:01,224
MATT: Yes.

1918
01:20:01,224 --> 01:20:02,877
MARISHA: And then I'm gonna go ahead

1919
01:20:02,877 --> 01:20:04,434
and let me keep track of all this.

1920
01:20:04,434 --> 01:20:07,860
And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight

1921
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,853
on Grog's helmet.

1922
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,896
Are we ready for this, are we going?

1923
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:13,729
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

1924
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:14,562
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1925
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:18,418
MARISHA: And I'm gonna go ahead
and cast Daylight on--

1926
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:19,472
SAM: Wait.

1927
01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:20,305
TRAVIS: What?

1928
01:20:20,305 --> 01:20:21,191
SAM: Wait.

1929
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:24,626
We're trying to sneak
over them before we land.

1930
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:26,310
Don't cast Daylight on anything yet.

1931
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,752
We don't wanna be bright
and shiny in the sky.

1932
01:20:28,752 --> 01:20:30,807
MATT: A giant flare coasting over the city.

1933
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:31,906
TRAVIS: We'll be like UFO's.

1934
01:20:31,906 --> 01:20:33,320
LIAM: (hissing)

1935
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,970
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead and
cast Pass Without A Trace

1936
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:35,803
on myself.

1937
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:39,659
MATT: All right, so that's preparation there.

1938
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:43,151
SAM: I'm gonna sing a little
ditty to inspire Vax.

1939
01:20:43,151 --> 01:20:45,785
♫ I didn't see the Vax

1940
01:20:45,785 --> 01:20:48,972
♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy

1941
01:20:48,972 --> 01:20:52,829
♫ Da da da da da da da da

1942
01:20:52,829 --> 01:20:54,240
TRAVIS: Was that "I Saw The Sun"?

1943
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,073
SAM: Yes it was.

1944
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:57,018
(all laugh)

1945
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,464
MATT: That wondrous rendition allows you

1946
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:01,714
a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.

1947
01:21:04,933 --> 01:21:06,213
ORION: Is everybody finished?

1948
01:21:06,213 --> 01:21:09,167
LIAM: Vox Machina, let's do this shit.

1949
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:12,219
MARISHA: I turn into an eagle,
and I'll take the gnomes.

1950
01:21:12,219 --> 01:21:13,731
MATT: All right.

1951
01:21:13,731 --> 01:21:14,564
Scanlan.

1952
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:16,830
Pike is heavy with the plate mail,

1953
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:21,028
but it's still enough to carry
with your giant eagle form.

1954
01:21:21,028 --> 01:21:23,243
LIAM: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet,

1955
01:21:23,243 --> 01:21:27,410
and Tiberius, are you good
to help Grog fly across?

1956
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:29,226
ORION: Fly.

1957
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:34,518
MATT: At which point you feel this
strange lifting sensation,

1958
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:36,680
for a second your stomach
kind of has butterflies,

1959
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,720
and you realize that you
can just think forward,

1960
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,024
and you drift forward.

1961
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:42,821
Think back, you drift back.

1962
01:21:42,821 --> 01:21:44,738
Think up, you drift up.

1963
01:21:45,598 --> 01:21:47,322
TRAVIS: Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though,

1964
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:49,773
that would be gross.

1965
01:21:49,773 --> 01:21:52,734
(imitates puking)

1966
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:55,630
ORION: Am I light enough for him to take me in?

1967
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,112
TRAVIS: I can't see anything.

1968
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,840
Just a cauldron on my head.

1969
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,696
ORION: For him to carry me.

1970
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:00,529
MATT: For him to carry you?

1971
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:01,389
Yeah, yeah.

1972
01:22:01,389 --> 01:22:03,317
ORION: I hop on your back.

1973
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:04,635
Let's go, Grog.

1974
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:05,468
TRAVIS: Great.

1975
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,630
MARISHA: I guess the rest of them are on the rug?

1976
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,560
TRAVIS: I can't see, so you gotta tell me.

1977
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,250
I start flying the wrong way.

1978
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,329
ORION: Back up, the other way,
other way, very good.

1979
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:18,333
MATT: You actually clutch Grog
by the sides of his face,

1980
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,544
and start steering him.

1981
01:22:19,544 --> 01:22:21,189
(all laugh)

1982
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:22,146
ORION: Wherever I move your head,

1983
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,729
just tilt that way.

1984
01:22:26,212 --> 01:22:29,008
SAM: Are we all in flight now?

1985
01:22:29,008 --> 01:22:30,079
LIAM: We're all taken care of, yes.

1986
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:32,298
SAM: And the carpet?

1987
01:22:32,298 --> 01:22:34,973
LIAM: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet.

1988
01:22:34,973 --> 01:22:36,390
SAM: What about Vex?

1989
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,166
Is she with us?

1990
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,022
ASHLEY: She's on the carpet.

1991
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:40,059
SAM: She's staying behind.

1992
01:22:40,059 --> 01:22:42,411
MATT: Vex, for the time being,

1993
01:22:42,411 --> 01:22:44,888
because it's just easier
to organize for that,

1994
01:22:44,888 --> 01:22:46,570
is coming on the carpet with you guys,

1995
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:49,820
and is preparing in case she is needed.

1996
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:52,525
TALIESIN: She's just quiet 
'cause she's feeling smug

1997
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:53,882
about the last game.

1998
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:54,715
LIAM: Yes.

1999
01:22:55,609 --> 01:23:00,078
MATT: She's feeling smug about
making another RPG right now.

2000
01:23:00,078 --> 01:23:00,911
LIAM: She'll be back.

2001
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:03,257
SAM: I wanna see how you fly, Grog.

2002
01:23:03,257 --> 01:23:05,392
ORION: It's really rickety!

2003
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:07,600
TRAVIS: It's one arm in and one forward.

2004
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,030
(all laugh)

2005
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,113
ORION: Just think.

2006
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:14,776
LIAM: Do you propel yourself with thoughts?

2007
01:23:14,776 --> 01:23:16,963
MATT: It's an awkward zig zag.

2008
01:23:16,963 --> 01:23:20,046
TALIESIN: Do you think happy thoughts?

2009
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:23,590
MARISHA: I'm gonna fly in the middle

2010
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:26,709
between Grog and the carpet,

2011
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:30,876
that way my Pass Without A
Trace encompasses everybody.

2012
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:32,870
MATT: All right.

2013
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:35,604
LIAM: I turn to Scanlan and say, Scanlan,

2014
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:38,055
we are probably going to die today.

2015
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,759
It has been an honor.

2016
01:23:39,759 --> 01:23:41,489
SAM: It has been an honor.

2017
01:23:41,489 --> 01:23:42,534
ASHLEY: You won't die today.

2018
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:44,076
SAM: Only one of us will die.

2019
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:45,659
And it won't be me.

2020
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:48,581
I can be invisible.

2021
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:49,414
(all laugh)

2022
01:23:49,414 --> 01:23:51,416
ORION: You're not listening, it'll just happen.

2023
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:52,266
LIAM: What were you saying Tiberius?

2024
01:23:52,266 --> 01:23:53,470
ORION: Nothing.

2025
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:57,546
LIAM: Don't play it that way,
what were you saying?

2026
01:23:57,546 --> 01:23:59,476
ORION: I was saying, if you're all finished,

2027
01:23:59,476 --> 01:24:03,277
I'll just make you invisible
right before it happens.

2028
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:05,681
MATT: You guys are all coasting over the chasm.

2029
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:08,481
Now you're over the top
of the large bridge,

2030
01:24:08,481 --> 01:24:12,314
and the 200-foot-wide
open hole in this tunnel

2031
01:24:13,854 --> 01:24:15,741
that leads to the lake below.

2032
01:24:15,741 --> 01:24:18,364
As you glance down, you
can see just a little bit

2033
01:24:18,364 --> 01:24:19,670
of a trickle from the soft red light

2034
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,922
that is deeper inside.

2035
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,219
You can see the small streams of lava,

2036
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:24,132
they're just slowly pooling at the bottom

2037
01:24:24,132 --> 01:24:27,082
on the outskirts of the lake proper.

2038
01:24:27,082 --> 01:24:29,697
As you begin to make it to the other side,

2039
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,626
you can see tiny shapes moving in this

2040
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:34,543
barely lit war camp of the duergar.

2041
01:24:36,763 --> 01:24:37,875
As you're coasting over,

2042
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:42,735
and Clarota is along with
you guys with his hood up,

2043
01:24:42,735 --> 01:24:45,735
he kind of whispers into
all of your heads, just,

2044
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:48,485
"Beware that some of these armies

2045
01:24:49,831 --> 01:24:53,914
"carry abominations created
below within my city.

2046
01:24:56,734 --> 01:25:00,045
"I know not what to expect from them.

2047
01:25:00,045 --> 01:25:01,212
"So be wary."

2048
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:07,050
As this happens, everyone
make a stealth check.

2049
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:09,397
Everyone, because of the
Pass Without A Track,

2050
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:11,204
everyone gets a plus ten
to their stealth check.

2051
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:12,037
TRAVIS: Plus ten?

2052
01:25:12,037 --> 01:25:13,311
MATT: Plus ten.

2053
01:25:13,311 --> 01:25:14,592
Thanks to Keyleth.
SAM: Thank God.

2054
01:25:14,592 --> 01:25:16,283
MATT: Keyleth, however, you
are carrying two gnomes,

2055
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:17,862
so you have a disadvantage on it.

2056
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,060
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2057
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,310
LIAM: It's all right.

2058
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,048
MARISHA: Even with the plus 10?

2059
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:30,652
18?

2060
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:31,485
MATT: 18.

2061
01:25:31,485 --> 01:25:32,318
SAM: 15.

2062
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:35,994
TALIESIN: 22.

2063
01:25:35,994 --> 01:25:37,170
TRAVIS: 27.

2064
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,065
SAM: Wow.

2065
01:25:38,065 --> 01:25:38,898
ASHLEY: 23.
LIAM: 28.

2066
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:45,642
MATT: All right.

2067
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:48,926
You guys begin to crest over
the very top of the war camp,

2068
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,234
and looking down you can see now,

2069
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:52,417
there are what looks to be the beginnings

2070
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:55,277
of tunneling siege
engines being constructed.

2071
01:25:55,277 --> 01:25:56,496
SAM: What? Siege?

2072
01:25:56,496 --> 01:25:57,391
MATT: Siege.

2073
01:25:57,391 --> 01:26:00,552
You can see giant wheeled
carts with drills up front,

2074
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:04,362
giant auger bores that are
being currently constructed.

2075
01:26:04,362 --> 01:26:06,369
You can see what looks
like a series of weapons

2076
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:07,539
being stacked at the ready.

2077
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:09,232
You can see there is a preparation

2078
01:26:09,232 --> 01:26:12,821
for some sort of attack
on the city above.

2079
01:26:12,821 --> 01:26:14,090
LIAM: Want to take Kraghammer.

2080
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,670
MATT: Continue to press ahead.

2081
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:20,261
There does not seem to be
any reaction to your flying.

2082
01:26:20,261 --> 01:26:21,426
SAM: Don't say anything.

2083
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,310
LIAM: This close to the ceiling.

2084
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,364
ASHLEY: Good thing we didn't cast the light.

2085
01:26:25,364 --> 01:26:28,233
ORION: We can all talk to each other.

2086
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:30,423
SAM: Whisper to each other.

2087
01:26:30,423 --> 01:26:31,256
Shut up!

2088
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:33,051
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

2089
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:35,361
SAM: Just wait 'til we get there.

2090
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:39,600
MATT: You guys make it towards the
center portion of the city.

2091
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,456
TRAVIS: Roll shake it, roll
shake it, roll shake it.

2092
01:26:41,456 --> 01:26:42,456
TALIESIN: Die rolls.

2093
01:26:44,437 --> 01:26:46,046
MATT: You can just start beginning to see

2094
01:26:46,046 --> 01:26:48,461
the opening in the
center of this war camp.

2095
01:26:48,461 --> 01:26:51,285
There is a circle where there
are no tents constructed,

2096
01:26:51,285 --> 01:26:53,784
you can see what looks to
be a small wooden platform,

2097
01:26:53,784 --> 01:26:57,367
and there is a stone
building that is of

2098
01:26:58,523 --> 01:27:01,296
makeshift functional construction.

2099
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:03,080
Not pretty, but functional,
looks like a barracks,

2100
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,096
or some sort of a large bunker.

2101
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:08,629
Right on the northern
side of that opening,

2102
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:10,903
that center portion of the war camp.

2103
01:27:10,903 --> 01:27:12,631
That would be what you saw,

2104
01:27:12,631 --> 01:27:15,543
both the general and the mind
flayer head of this encampment

2105
01:27:15,543 --> 01:27:17,009
go into last time you--

2106
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:17,842
SAM: The barracks.

2107
01:27:17,842 --> 01:27:18,675
MATT: Yes.

2108
01:27:18,675 --> 01:27:19,508
SAM: With a roof?

2109
01:27:19,508 --> 01:27:20,456
MATT: There is a roof to it,

2110
01:27:20,456 --> 01:27:22,097
you don't know if there's any roof access.

2111
01:27:22,097 --> 01:27:23,764
But there is a roof.

2112
01:27:25,216 --> 01:27:27,472
LIAM: Tiberius, can you turn me invisible now.

2113
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:29,699
ORION: (sputtering)

2114
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:32,699
SAM: But we're still in the air, right?

2115
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:34,838
He's gotta concentrate on that.

2116
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:36,546
LIAM: He's sitting on the carpet.

2117
01:27:36,546 --> 01:27:37,379
SAM: Yeah but he's--

2118
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:38,707
MARISHA: Thinking about--

2119
01:27:38,707 --> 01:27:40,104
SAM: Him flying.

2120
01:27:40,104 --> 01:27:41,661
ORION: I cast invisibility on you,

2121
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:43,156
that's when everything happens.

2122
01:27:43,156 --> 01:27:45,406
(all laugh)

2123
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:48,201
MARISHA: Just falls from the air.

2124
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:50,245
LIAM: So are we floating above?

2125
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:51,903
MATT: You guys are currently

2126
01:27:51,903 --> 01:27:55,298
floating about 100 to 150
feet above the war camp,

2127
01:27:55,298 --> 01:27:57,475
you do not appear to
have been noticed yet.

2128
01:27:57,475 --> 01:27:58,308
TRAVIS: Get down there and wing it.

2129
01:27:58,308 --> 01:27:59,553
SAM: Should we land on the roof?

2130
01:27:59,553 --> 01:28:01,776
Or do we land right
outside the barracks door?

2131
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:02,609
What do we do?

2132
01:28:02,609 --> 01:28:04,277
ASHLEY: Roof, roof, roof.

2133
01:28:04,277 --> 01:28:06,246
SAM: You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?

2134
01:28:06,246 --> 01:28:07,242
TRAVIS: You go!

2135
01:28:07,242 --> 01:28:08,075
Yes.

2136
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:08,908
SAM: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yes!

2137
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:09,805
MARISHA: We can start on the roof,

2138
01:28:09,805 --> 01:28:10,857
that way that gives us time.

2139
01:28:10,857 --> 01:28:13,215
LIAM: But I can't go invisible
while you're flying.

2140
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:14,083
TRAVIS: Who needs you to be invisible?

2141
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:15,342
You're a stealthy bastard.

2142
01:28:15,342 --> 01:28:16,979
ORION: We land on the roof, we get in there,

2143
01:28:16,979 --> 01:28:18,118
I cast Invisibility on you,

2144
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:19,077
and then you go do your thing.

2145
01:28:19,077 --> 01:28:22,064
LIAM: We're running the risk of
as we come down on Duergar,

2146
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:23,760
going (groans).

2147
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,612
ORION: We would risk that anyway, either way.

2148
01:28:27,612 --> 01:28:29,380
SAM: I'm so scared right now.

2149
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,597
(all laugh)

2150
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:33,782
TRAVIS: Why don't we land on the roof

2151
01:28:33,782 --> 01:28:35,221
and we all lay flat,

2152
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:36,365
except for the people that are going in,

2153
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:37,643
and you cast Invisibility.

2154
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:38,940
SAM: This is the exact 
conversation they had

2155
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,764
when they were about to go kill Osama.

2156
01:28:40,764 --> 01:28:43,014
(all laugh)

2157
01:28:45,316 --> 01:28:47,043
ORION: Wait, I have an idea.

2158
01:28:47,043 --> 01:28:47,876
TRAVIS: Oh God.

2159
01:28:49,553 --> 01:28:51,281
ORION: Is there enough weight
for me get on the carpet

2160
01:28:51,281 --> 01:28:52,114
at this point?

2161
01:28:52,114 --> 01:28:54,242
ASHLEY: This is fucking stressful.

2162
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:55,312
MATT: You can certainly try.

2163
01:28:55,312 --> 01:28:57,474
There was weight, but you're not
aware of how much was on it.

2164
01:28:57,474 --> 01:28:59,809
ORION: Yes I do, it's 1000 pounds.

2165
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:03,186
MATT: You don't know how much
weight is on there, total.

2166
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:05,743
ORION: Everybody, how much do you weigh?

2167
01:29:05,743 --> 01:29:07,390
SAM: Don't ask a woman that!

2168
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:09,422
ORION: I'm sorry, Your Highness,
but I need to know.

2169
01:29:09,422 --> 01:29:11,512
The idea is if, I can
step off on the carpet,

2170
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,818
and hang with you guys,

2171
01:29:13,818 --> 01:29:17,514
then Grog you can float down to the

2172
01:29:17,514 --> 01:29:20,854
whatchamacallit, and take Vax here,

2173
01:29:20,854 --> 01:29:23,780
then I can, oh shit, I need
to be near you to cast it,

2174
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,248
damn it!
(all laugh)

2175
01:29:26,248 --> 01:29:27,186
MARISHA: Let's just land on the roof.

2176
01:29:27,186 --> 01:29:28,361
ASHLEY: Let's land on the roof.

2177
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:32,326
LIAM: We're gonna go in, we're
gonna hit the roof,

2178
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:34,219
you turn me invisible,
he turns him invisible,

2179
01:29:34,219 --> 01:29:37,102
you guys light up the
night, and we just do it,

2180
01:29:37,102 --> 01:29:37,935
we just gotta go.

2181
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:38,768
ASHLEY: We're lighting up now?

2182
01:29:38,768 --> 01:29:40,872
SAM: You light up on the roof?

2183
01:29:40,872 --> 01:29:42,717
Let's look for access first.

2184
01:29:42,717 --> 01:29:44,230
Don't light up 'til we give the go aside.

2185
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:45,320
ASHLEY: We're still not safe stealthy.

2186
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,644
ORION: We need to wait before we light up.

2187
01:29:46,644 --> 01:29:50,158
LIAM: If anyone takes notice,
then turn off the lights.

2188
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:51,055
SAM: By the way--

2189
01:29:51,055 --> 01:29:53,725
TALIESIN: Do not light up until you see the black

2190
01:29:53,725 --> 01:29:54,934
or greens of their eyes.

2191
01:29:54,934 --> 01:29:56,934
SAM: By the way, Clarota--

2192
01:29:57,861 --> 01:30:00,812
Clarota you have definitely
picked the right people

2193
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:01,979
to assist you.

2194
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,728
MATT: There's no verbal response,

2195
01:30:05,728 --> 01:30:09,720
but you do just emotionally
sense a slight hint of regret.

2196
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,992
(all laugh)

2197
01:30:11,992 --> 01:30:13,743
MATT: Emanating from the mind flayer.

2198
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:14,910
SAM: We got this!

2199
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:17,905
All right, let's go land on the roof.

2200
01:30:17,905 --> 01:30:20,413
LIAM: All right, let's do it.

2201
01:30:20,413 --> 01:30:21,742
MATT: You guys descend.

2202
01:30:21,742 --> 01:30:22,825
ORION: Down, down.

2203
01:30:23,764 --> 01:30:25,907
MATT: Eagle flies down, you both,
(wind rushing),

2204
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:26,962
as part of the landing,

2205
01:30:26,962 --> 01:30:29,330
everyone make a secondary stealth check.

2206
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,004
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We still have that plus 10?

2207
01:30:31,004 --> 01:30:32,192
MATT: You still have the spell.

2208
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:33,599
ORION: Oh yes!

2209
01:30:33,599 --> 01:30:34,432
MARISHA: Oh, that was cocked.

2210
01:30:34,432 --> 01:30:35,573
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2211
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:36,406
MARISHA: Oh, no!

2212
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:39,663
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person.

2213
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:40,817
SAM: 30.

2214
01:30:40,817 --> 01:30:41,650
ORION: 20.

2215
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:46,868
MARISHA: I'm like those boobies, that
crash land when they fall.

2216
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:47,701
MATT: You rolled at disadvantage?

2217
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:49,632
MARISHA: Well, I rolled a one.

2218
01:30:49,632 --> 01:30:50,922
MATT: Okay.

2219
01:30:50,922 --> 01:30:51,941
Two failures.

2220
01:30:51,941 --> 01:30:53,441
TALIESIN: That's a 15, 29.

2221
01:30:55,511 --> 01:30:56,721
TRAVIS: 23.
ASHLEY: 21.

2222
01:30:56,721 --> 01:30:57,759
LIAM: 28.

2223
01:30:57,759 --> 01:31:01,342
MATT: Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace.

2224
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:06,099
A bit of a harsh landing,
from your perspective,

2225
01:31:06,099 --> 01:31:09,884
but thankfully you have two
small gnomes to break your fall.

2226
01:31:09,884 --> 01:31:11,697
ASHLEY and SAM: (groan)

2227
01:31:11,697 --> 01:31:14,515
MATT: You drag them a little bit
across the stonework on the top.

2228
01:31:14,515 --> 01:31:15,633
It's not stonework, actually.

2229
01:31:15,633 --> 01:31:17,377
Most of this whole thing, is stonework,

2230
01:31:17,377 --> 01:31:21,387
it looks like the roof
of this is made of

2231
01:31:21,387 --> 01:31:23,720
like a thick scavenged wood.

2232
01:31:25,978 --> 01:31:27,076
Whether it was taken from the surface

2233
01:31:27,076 --> 01:31:28,133
or from the mines itself,

2234
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:30,820
it is just wooden planks
that are all keeping--

2235
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,540
ASHLEY: Let's go in through the roof.

2236
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,370
TALIESIN: It's reclaimed, it's very nice.

2237
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,214
LIAM: If that thing sees us, though,

2238
01:31:36,214 --> 01:31:37,800
it could be game over.

2239
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,246
I still think we should stick to the plan

2240
01:31:39,246 --> 01:31:40,525
of blinding it.

2241
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:41,591
ORION: Yeah, do it.

2242
01:31:41,591 --> 01:31:43,450
SAM: So some of us need to go inside.

2243
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:44,462
LIAM: You and I.

2244
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:49,363
TRAVIS: Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit
goes down, we light it up.

2245
01:31:49,363 --> 01:31:52,527
LIAM: I will fucking yell into my
earring if shit goes down,

2246
01:31:52,527 --> 01:31:54,145
and you guys gotta pray for me.

2247
01:31:54,145 --> 01:31:54,978
TRAVIS: Go find shit!

2248
01:31:54,978 --> 01:31:58,282
SAM: We look around for any roof access.

2249
01:31:58,282 --> 01:31:59,882
TRAVIS: Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.

2250
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:01,967
MATT: Looking around, there is no roof entrance.

2251
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,163
It looks like it is
purely a functional roof

2252
01:32:04,163 --> 01:32:06,704
for any weathering, rocks,

2253
01:32:06,704 --> 01:32:08,674
you do see there are a few small rocks

2254
01:32:08,674 --> 01:32:12,266
and pieces of cavern that
may have plummeted here.

2255
01:32:12,266 --> 01:32:13,953
SAM: No chimneys.

2256
01:32:13,953 --> 01:32:15,076
MATT: No chimneys, no nothing,

2257
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:16,401
there doesn't appear to be a fireplace,

2258
01:32:16,401 --> 01:32:18,982
or any sort of interior like that.

2259
01:32:18,982 --> 01:32:22,662
Glancing over the sides, you
can see that on the floor--

2260
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:25,415
You can't really tell if
there's two floors or not,

2261
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:28,158
it looks tall enough to have two floors,

2262
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:29,463
but you don't see a set of windows

2263
01:32:29,463 --> 01:32:31,842
or anything that belies that to you.

2264
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:34,333
May just be a really tall single floor.

2265
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,991
But there are a couple
of small window openings,

2266
01:32:36,991 --> 01:32:40,824
one on each side of-- 
[static]

2267
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:44,897
SAM: We're gonna go--

2268
01:32:44,897 --> 01:32:47,037
LIAM: Tiberius, could you do me a favor

2269
01:32:47,037 --> 01:32:49,341
of making me disappear?

2270
01:32:49,341 --> 01:32:52,468
ORION: Yes, when I do this, though,
it's going to be very cool.

2271
01:32:52,468 --> 01:32:54,394
(all laugh)

2272
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:56,745
LIAM: Holy shit, where are my hands?

2273
01:32:56,745 --> 01:32:57,747
ORION: Right?

2274
01:32:57,747 --> 01:32:59,393
MATT: You immediately disappear from view.

2275
01:32:59,393 --> 01:33:01,818
You currently, visually do not exist.

2276
01:33:01,818 --> 01:33:03,003
MARISHA: And you still have my buff.

2277
01:33:03,003 --> 01:33:04,378
TRAVIS: We're like, flat on the roof, right?

2278
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:06,551
MATT: You guys are all on the
roof now, you're fine.

2279
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:07,571
Your Fly spell vanishes,

2280
01:33:07,571 --> 01:33:09,398
you feel your weight
return to you for a second.

2281
01:33:09,398 --> 01:33:10,723
For a split moment you're a little sad,

2282
01:33:10,723 --> 01:33:11,556
'cause you were having fun.

2283
01:33:11,556 --> 01:33:12,389
TRAVIS: Oh.

2284
01:33:12,389 --> 01:33:13,571
(all laugh)

2285
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:15,724
TRAVIS: I was a dancer.

2286
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:18,604
SAM: We can see the window,
we pick one of the sides,

2287
01:33:18,604 --> 01:33:20,281
I don't know, west side.

2288
01:33:20,281 --> 01:33:21,188
MATT: West side!

2289
01:33:21,188 --> 01:33:23,021
SAM: Is it a single pane?

2290
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:26,041
Is it an openable window?

2291
01:33:27,188 --> 01:33:29,970
MATT: As you glance over, it is just an opening.

2292
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,448
There is no glass.

2293
01:33:31,448 --> 01:33:32,321
There is nothing blocking the way.

2294
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:35,962
It is about roughly big enough to fit

2295
01:33:35,962 --> 01:33:39,144
a normal-sized half-elf or human.

2296
01:33:39,144 --> 01:33:42,311
LIAM: I take Scanlan by the scruff, and

2297
01:33:43,286 --> 01:33:44,935
swing him down.

2298
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:47,410
SAM: Oh, I turn invisible.

2299
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,572
MATT: As you grab him and
you're bringing him down,

2300
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:50,512
you cast Invisibility on yourself,

2301
01:33:50,512 --> 01:33:51,555
you both vanish now,

2302
01:33:51,555 --> 01:33:53,227
all the rest of you are
kind of holding your breath,

2303
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:55,052
hoping that now that you don't
know what's happening,

2304
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:56,417
it's gonna go well.

2305
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:58,492
LIAM: I'm scaling in after him.

2306
01:33:58,492 --> 01:34:01,156
LIAM: Go ahead and just make
an acrobatics check.

2307
01:34:01,156 --> 01:34:03,697
SAM: Don't roll a one, please don't drop me.

2308
01:34:03,697 --> 01:34:04,530
LIAM: 18.

2309
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:05,902
MATT: All right, yeah, you're good.

2310
01:34:05,902 --> 01:34:07,719
You gingerly scale down the wall,

2311
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:10,086
the stones thankfully are

2312
01:34:10,086 --> 01:34:11,464
just haphazardly put together,

2313
01:34:11,464 --> 01:34:13,311
where there's enough grip
space for you to catch on.

2314
01:34:13,311 --> 01:34:15,283
SAM: I have a climbing kit!

2315
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:16,116
(all laugh)

2316
01:34:16,116 --> 01:34:16,949
LIAM: We're in, we're in.

2317
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:18,518
MATT: Little late for that, but okay.

2318
01:34:18,518 --> 01:34:20,561
(all laugh)

2319
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:22,525
MATT: You lower him down, you bring him inside,

2320
01:34:22,525 --> 01:34:25,061
you step down through the opening,

2321
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:28,428
into the center of the hallway.

2322
01:34:28,428 --> 01:34:29,400
SAM: We can't talk to each other.

2323
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,345
TRAVIS: Yes we get a map, finally!

2324
01:34:31,345 --> 01:34:32,637
SAM: We can't signal each other,

2325
01:34:32,637 --> 01:34:34,858
and we don't know where each other is.

2326
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:36,200
I hold his hand.

2327
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,328
(all laugh)

2328
01:34:37,328 --> 01:34:40,639
LIAM: We're holding hands, I'm
leaning way down on the side.

2329
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,370
TRAVIS: 'Course you are.

2330
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,658
LIAM: Sam and I have done this before.

2331
01:34:44,658 --> 01:34:46,241
ORION: I use my earring.

2332
01:34:48,898 --> 01:34:52,086
SAM: I'm not gonna talk back to
you, so whatever you say.

2333
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:54,676
ORION: Just to remind you of how
these particular things work,

2334
01:34:54,676 --> 01:34:57,663
I'm not actually talking right now.

2335
01:34:57,663 --> 01:35:02,614
So you can just talk to each
other through the rings.

2336
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,180
MATT: As the two of you step into this room,

2337
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,013
you look about you,

2338
01:35:08,013 --> 01:35:11,525
and there are some ramshackle,
makeshift beds in the room.

2339
01:35:11,525 --> 01:35:13,169
Five to be exact, from right to left.

2340
01:35:13,169 --> 01:35:14,558
This appears to be one portion

2341
01:35:14,558 --> 01:35:18,115
of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement.

2342
01:35:18,115 --> 01:35:19,812
Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed,

2343
01:35:19,812 --> 01:35:20,883
they're not like well-kept or anything.

2344
01:35:20,883 --> 01:35:21,962
There's sheets kind of tossed about,

2345
01:35:21,962 --> 01:35:24,245
and it smells awful in here, but it--

2346
01:35:24,245 --> 01:35:27,595
LIAM: First, I just heard
Tiberius' voice in my head.

2347
01:35:27,595 --> 01:35:29,825
So I'm going to test it out and think.

2348
01:35:29,825 --> 01:35:31,788
Scanlan, can you hear me?

2349
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:33,205
SAM: Can I hear him?

2350
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:34,987
MATT: From?

2351
01:35:34,987 --> 01:35:38,665
LIAM: I heard Tiberius whispering about.

2352
01:35:38,665 --> 01:35:41,192
SAM: From thoughts only, can I hear him?

2353
01:35:41,192 --> 01:35:42,547
MATT: No.

2354
01:35:42,547 --> 01:35:46,714
LIAM: I tug on his hand to keep
going into the barracks.

2355
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:53,183
SAM: I notice that his hand
is weirdly cold and sweaty.

2356
01:35:53,183 --> 01:35:54,984
MATT: Yeah, not weirdly.

2357
01:35:54,984 --> 01:35:57,265
LIAM: You just lean to
live with the stage fright,

2358
01:35:57,265 --> 01:35:59,182
you never move past it.

2359
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,920
Should we pause right now?

2360
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,217
MARISHA: You didn't bring your stuff?

2361
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:05,641
LAURA: I didn't have it!

2362
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,801
ORION: Come on in!

2363
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:09,062
LIAM: Look, my sister's here.

2364
01:36:09,062 --> 01:36:10,674
LAURA: Hello!

2365
01:36:10,674 --> 01:36:13,113
LIAM: We'll make it work.

2366
01:36:13,113 --> 01:36:14,249
We'll bring you up to speed later,

2367
01:36:14,249 --> 01:36:16,544
you're on the roof of
Osama Bin Laden's house.

2368
01:36:16,544 --> 01:36:17,825
(all laugh)

2369
01:36:17,825 --> 01:36:19,946
LIAM: So question for the DM, I'm invisible.

2370
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:23,416
Do I need to stealth, do I stealth?

2371
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:24,696
MATT: There's still a stealth
check 'cause you're invisible,

2372
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:27,443
but noise is still a factor.

2373
01:36:27,443 --> 01:36:30,078
You just have 
advantage on your stealth check.

2374
01:36:30,078 --> 01:36:33,178
LIAM: So, I think we should probably stealth.

2375
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:34,636
And start moving in.

2376
01:36:34,636 --> 01:36:36,239
SAM: Yeah, that's, we tug each other.

2377
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:40,591
MATT: Beyond being invisible, you
guys make your stealth check.

2378
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:44,118
SAM: I mean, I'm invisible,
and I rolled a five.

2379
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:45,159
MATT: You have an advantage, you roll twice.

2380
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:48,254
'Cause you're both invisible.

2381
01:36:48,254 --> 01:36:49,087
SAM: 13.

2382
01:36:49,087 --> 01:36:49,921
LIAM: 20.

2383
01:36:49,921 --> 01:36:51,073
MATT: All right.

2384
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:52,507
You both feel you're stealthed,

2385
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:54,981
there is one opening into a hallway here.

2386
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:56,630
LIAM: We have, does anyone have a laser light?

2387
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:57,463
TRAVIS: Yep.

2388
01:36:57,463 --> 01:36:58,296
LIAM: All right.

2389
01:36:58,296 --> 01:37:00,129
TRAVIS: Squeeze it together.

2390
01:37:01,863 --> 01:37:03,353
Press the little button.

2391
01:37:03,353 --> 01:37:04,339
LIAM: Squeeze it together?

2392
01:37:04,339 --> 01:37:05,232
Ah, there we go.

2393
01:37:05,232 --> 01:37:08,662
Okay so we're going to go down here.

2394
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:10,598
MATT: Down to this one.

2395
01:37:10,598 --> 01:37:11,431
As you guys step out,

2396
01:37:11,431 --> 01:37:14,772
you can see immediately
there are two duergar guards

2397
01:37:14,772 --> 01:37:16,858
right by a door that leads
to a central chamber.

2398
01:37:16,858 --> 01:37:18,753
LIAM: So we're gonna go this way.

2399
01:37:18,753 --> 01:37:19,586
MATT: All right.

2400
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:23,972
Immediately you see--

2401
01:37:26,183 --> 01:37:28,595
TRAVIS: I like how you guys have
different-colored lightsabers.

2402
01:37:28,595 --> 01:37:30,391
MATT: Two more Duergar guards.

2403
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:33,917
TRAVIS: (lightsaber noises)

2404
01:37:33,917 --> 01:37:36,153
LIAM: All right, I'm inching up,

2405
01:37:36,153 --> 01:37:37,350
I'm pulling Scanlan behind me,

2406
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,779
but I'm inching up to this
door, just peeking through,

2407
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:40,909
seeing what I can see.

2408
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:42,667
MATT: Okay, looking inside, you
can see these small symbols,

2409
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:44,978
basically just red stone, the glow stone,

2410
01:37:44,978 --> 01:37:47,367
that lights the underground caverns here

2411
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,630
and in a large portion of Kraghammer,

2412
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:52,334
are just embedded in the
wall in a small sconce.

2413
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:54,739
Peering through here, you
see one against the wall,

2414
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:56,790
you also see along the edges here,

2415
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:59,103
what looks to be racks of spears and pikes

2416
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:02,770
and hammers and various war
accoutrements of weapons,

2417
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:05,363
just hanging, and there's a set of armor,

2418
01:38:05,363 --> 01:38:07,280
over a small, wooden

2419
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:12,746
arrangement, the armor itself
is just being stored there.

2420
01:38:12,746 --> 01:38:16,163
This looks to be like a fast-grab armory.

2421
01:38:17,815 --> 01:38:18,648
LIAM: Okay.

2422
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:23,223
I pull Scanlan by the hand,
and we enter into this room.

2423
01:38:23,223 --> 01:38:25,649
SAM: This is so romantic.

2424
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:28,304
LIAM: It's just like
the day we met, Sam.

2425
01:38:28,304 --> 01:38:29,197
MAT: You guys enter.

2426
01:38:29,197 --> 01:38:32,694
LIAM: Quietly walking this way.

2427
01:38:32,694 --> 01:38:34,705
We're past the door, that
looks like the front door.

2428
01:38:34,705 --> 01:38:36,619
MATT: It is the front door,
it is currently closed, though.

2429
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:37,787
LIAM: We're gonna keep going this way.

2430
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:41,287
SAM: Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking!

2431
01:38:42,928 --> 01:38:45,339
MATT: Just come out this way.

2432
01:38:45,339 --> 01:38:47,506
There is one duergar here.

2433
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:51,243
There doesn't appear to
be a doorway or entrance

2434
01:38:51,243 --> 01:38:54,102
to the central chamber on
this side of the hallway.

2435
01:38:54,102 --> 01:38:55,677
SAM: That's pretty good.

2436
01:38:55,677 --> 01:38:57,579
LIAM: I still have the pitch in a bucket.

2437
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:00,564
The shit in a bucket
in my hand, by the way.

2438
01:39:00,564 --> 01:39:02,590
SAM: We can take these guys,
I'm not worried about that.

2439
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:04,257
LIAM: But we'd make noise.

2440
01:39:05,574 --> 01:39:10,087
How far apart are the two
duergar standing in that door?

2441
01:39:10,087 --> 01:39:12,549
MATT: They're about five feet
apart, just enough space,

2442
01:39:12,549 --> 01:39:15,966
like one is on each side of the doorway.

2443
01:39:18,045 --> 01:39:18,878
LIAM: Okay.

2444
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:21,914
SAM: Wait.

2445
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:25,670
What are those red things right there?

2446
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:28,058
MATT: Those are the small sconces
with the glow stone,

2447
01:39:28,058 --> 01:39:29,806
the red stone that lights the--

2448
01:39:29,806 --> 01:39:31,475
SAM: So we're trying to get there.

2449
01:39:31,475 --> 01:39:33,934
ORION: -- with Greater Invisibility,
so you can attack,

2450
01:39:33,934 --> 01:39:36,270
and you'll still be invisible.

2451
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:40,020
LIAM: I pull a gold coin out of my pocket,

2452
01:39:43,181 --> 01:39:45,514
and throw it in this corner.

2453
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:48,415
SAM: This is straight up Metal Gear.

2454
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:51,279
(all laugh)

2455
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:55,249
MATT: Go ahead and just make a
general dexterity check.

2456
01:39:55,249 --> 01:39:57,906
LIAM: And because of Keyleth, I
have advantage, correct?

2457
01:39:57,906 --> 01:39:58,997
MATT: Yes.

2458
01:39:58,997 --> 01:39:59,830
ORION: Sure do.

2459
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:03,377
LIAM: So this is, what is this?

2460
01:40:03,377 --> 01:40:06,297
MATT: Just a dexterity modifier.

2461
01:40:06,297 --> 01:40:07,758
LIAM: So that's a 17.

2462
01:40:07,758 --> 01:40:09,175
MATT: All right, you--

2463
01:40:11,265 --> 01:40:13,322
(coin ringing)

2464
01:40:13,322 --> 01:40:16,551
Ringing sound, both of the
duergar kinda look over.

2465
01:40:16,551 --> 01:40:18,609
They look at each other.

2466
01:40:18,609 --> 01:40:20,551
Grunt for a second.

2467
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:22,367
This one nods her head
and begins walking over

2468
01:40:22,367 --> 01:40:24,566
to inspect it, this one stays at its post.

2469
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:26,071
MARISHA: (Metal Gear voice) Must have been my 
imagination.

2470
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:28,321
(all laugh)

2471
01:40:29,905 --> 01:40:32,155
LIAM: I pull Scanlan behind me,

2472
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:37,236
and tiptoe right behind this asshole.

2473
01:40:39,049 --> 01:40:41,062
TRAVIS: Do it! Put it in him!

2474
01:40:41,062 --> 01:40:44,086
LIAM: And take out my vorpal blade.

2475
01:40:44,086 --> 01:40:45,749
And reach out and grab him by the hair

2476
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:47,055
and stick it in the back of his neck.

2477
01:40:47,055 --> 01:40:48,523
SAM: You got my dice.

2478
01:40:48,523 --> 01:40:50,707
MATT: All right, so, as you reach up,

2479
01:40:50,707 --> 01:40:53,861
you grasp the back of this really nasty,

2480
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:56,063
wiry, thick duergar hair--

2481
01:40:56,063 --> 01:40:57,228
LIAM: I'm so tense right now.

2482
01:40:57,228 --> 01:41:00,702
MATT: You yank the head back, and
take the base of the blade,

2483
01:41:00,702 --> 01:41:03,180
go ahead and make an attack roll.

2484
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:04,077
It's a surprise roll,

2485
01:41:04,077 --> 01:41:06,979
so you have an advantage on the attack.

2486
01:41:06,979 --> 01:41:07,812
LIAM: Okay, good.

2487
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,176
MATT: I believe you have a bonus too,

2488
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:11,177
if you get the attack.

2489
01:41:11,177 --> 01:41:12,010
LIAM: Yes.

2490
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,843
MARISHA: Sneak attack?

2491
01:41:12,843 --> 01:41:14,093
LIAM: Well, I get--

2492
01:41:14,932 --> 01:41:16,548
Yes, I get

2493
01:41:16,548 --> 01:41:20,810
advantage, but you can't triple
up on advantage I believe?

2494
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,999
(loud bang offscreen)

2495
01:41:21,999 --> 01:41:22,832
SAM: What was that?

2496
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:25,165
MATT: That was to freak you out.

2497
01:41:26,194 --> 01:41:27,541
All right, so just double-checking here

2498
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:28,908
as part of your ability.

2499
01:41:28,908 --> 01:41:33,075
SAM: Remember every 50 subscribers
gets a free giveaway.

2500
01:41:33,952 --> 01:41:36,315
ORION: Subscribe now, kids.

2501
01:41:36,315 --> 01:41:37,394
ASHLEY: What is that smile?

2502
01:41:37,394 --> 01:41:39,144
MATT: If you score it, and the creature 
is surprised,

2503
01:41:39,144 --> 01:41:40,397
it is a critical hit,
that's the other thing

2504
01:41:40,397 --> 01:41:41,230
I was going to mention.

2505
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:42,063
LIAM: Thank you.

2506
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:45,123
So this isn't a dexterity
check, this is an attack.

2507
01:41:45,123 --> 01:41:47,351
MATT: This is an attack.

2508
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:48,285
LIAM: Okay.

2509
01:41:48,285 --> 01:41:49,535
So that's a 26.

2510
01:41:51,126 --> 01:41:52,903
MATT: That is going to hit, and
that is a critical hit.

2511
01:41:52,903 --> 01:41:54,280
Go ahead and roll damage with Sneak Attack.

2512
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,113
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2513
01:41:56,128 --> 01:41:57,295
LAURA: Die die die.

2514
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:00,739
LIAM: I'm sweating.

2515
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:02,893
Okay, that's two plus seven is nine.

2516
01:42:02,893 --> 01:42:05,810
That's nine, that's just that part.

2517
01:42:06,837 --> 01:42:08,298
Six.

2518
01:42:08,298 --> 01:42:09,726
Seven.

2519
01:42:09,726 --> 01:42:11,088
Nine.

2520
01:42:11,088 --> 01:42:11,921
14.

2521
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:13,954
And 19.

2522
01:42:15,852 --> 01:42:17,903
Which is, what's doubled,
the Sneak Attack damage?

2523
01:42:17,903 --> 01:42:19,541
MATT: The Sneak Attack damage
and the dice damage.

2524
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:22,931
MATT: And the dice damage, 19 plus, is 26,

2525
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:24,069
52.

2526
01:42:24,069 --> 01:42:24,996
MARISHA: Oh!

2527
01:42:24,996 --> 01:42:25,854
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2528
01:42:25,854 --> 01:42:28,616
MATT: As you pull the head back,
you can hear a slight,

2529
01:42:28,616 --> 01:42:31,119
a slight (gurgles) is about as much noise

2530
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,157
as can make it out before the blade just,

2531
01:42:33,157 --> 01:42:34,723
right out the front of its throat,

2532
01:42:34,723 --> 01:42:36,375
blocking any passage of the air.

2533
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,521
As you hold it, you twist the blade,

2534
01:42:38,521 --> 01:42:39,464
it goes limp in your hand,

2535
01:42:39,464 --> 01:42:40,816
but you catch it and
keep holding it there,

2536
01:42:40,816 --> 01:42:42,187
so it doesn't make any noise.

2537
01:42:42,187 --> 01:42:43,875
You're now clutching a dead duergar.

2538
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,511
SAM: Easy, easy.

2539
01:42:45,511 --> 01:42:47,678
ASHLEY: (shushes) Night-night.

2540
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:49,933
LAURA: Oh yeah!

2541
01:42:49,933 --> 01:42:51,534
TRAVIS: Lean him up against the wall!
Like he's standing there.

2542
01:42:51,534 --> 01:42:52,367
LIAM: Just had a thought,

2543
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:55,545
I'm going to sit him
back against the wall,

2544
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:58,695
and let him slide against
it, and grab Scanlan,

2545
01:42:58,695 --> 01:43:00,195
and into the room.

2546
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:03,926
MATT: Into this room?

2547
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:05,866
MARISHA: There's Scanlan.

2548
01:43:05,866 --> 01:43:08,365
TALIESIN: He's still standing up, kind of.

2549
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:11,761
LAURA: Why is he leading
Scanlan, what's happening?

2550
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:14,205
LIAM: (shushes)

2551
01:43:14,205 --> 01:43:18,370
SAM: While I'm invisible, I
look around for traps.

2552
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:21,335
I'm just gonna see if
there's any trap doors.

2553
01:43:21,335 --> 01:43:24,016
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

2554
01:43:24,016 --> 01:43:25,113
SAM: Not great?

2555
01:43:25,113 --> 01:43:26,196
LIAM: I got a 28.

2556
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:29,403
SAM: Nine.

2557
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:31,148
MATT: You notice no traps. What
you do notice, though,

2558
01:43:31,148 --> 01:43:33,137
is there a giant kind of war room table,

2559
01:43:33,137 --> 01:43:34,565
at the top of this raised platform.

2560
01:43:34,565 --> 01:43:36,298
It's about six feet up,

2561
01:43:36,298 --> 01:43:38,405
and there's a stairway
that leads up to it.

2562
01:43:38,405 --> 01:43:40,155
You see at the table.

2563
01:43:41,186 --> 01:43:43,130
One of the illithid mind flayers.

2564
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:46,555
The armored general that you saw before.

2565
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:48,387
And there are two other duergar currently

2566
01:43:48,387 --> 01:43:50,246
at the table.

2567
01:43:50,246 --> 01:43:51,867
TRAVIS: Nope, nope, nope, nope.

2568
01:43:51,867 --> 01:43:54,125
ASHLEY: Stay invisible.

2569
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:55,773
SAM: We can't communicate.

2570
01:43:55,773 --> 01:43:56,787
TRAVIS: You guys have got seconds until

2571
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:57,701
that other guard comes back.

2572
01:43:57,701 --> 01:43:58,598
LIAM: We can't talk.

2573
01:43:58,598 --> 01:43:59,582
MATT: You hear footsteps behind you.

2574
01:43:59,582 --> 01:44:02,851
LIAM: I put the bucket of shit
into Scanlan's hands.

2575
01:44:02,851 --> 01:44:04,344
LAURA: What are you doing?

2576
01:44:04,344 --> 01:44:05,486
LIAM: Give him a little nudge,

2577
01:44:05,486 --> 01:44:06,673
a gentle little nudge.

2578
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:08,441
SAM: I step forward into the room,

2579
01:44:08,441 --> 01:44:10,501
and I hurl it at the fucker's face.

2580
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:12,131
The mind controllers.

2581
01:44:12,131 --> 01:44:15,588
LIAM: And I'm rolling behind
him at the same time.

2582
01:44:15,588 --> 01:44:18,339
Behind the illithid, ready to go.

2583
01:44:18,339 --> 01:44:19,483
MATT: So I'll say you go up here as well?

2584
01:44:19,483 --> 01:44:22,033
LIAM: Oh yeah, behind him, behind him.

2585
01:44:22,033 --> 01:44:23,041
LAURA: What is happening?

2586
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:24,680
MATT: Make a stealth check, both of you.

2587
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,355
TRAVIS: Oh God, oh God.

2588
01:44:26,355 --> 01:44:28,188
Oh God, over extended.

2589
01:44:30,127 --> 01:44:31,868
SAM: Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth?

2590
01:44:31,868 --> 01:44:32,701
MATT: No.

2591
01:44:32,701 --> 01:44:34,315
LIAM: Plus advantage, oh thank christ.

2592
01:44:34,315 --> 01:44:35,307
SAM: 19.

2593
01:44:35,307 --> 01:44:38,557
LIAM: Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29.

2594
01:44:39,842 --> 01:44:41,842
(sighs)

2595
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,753
MATT: Okay.

2596
01:44:46,222 --> 01:44:48,288
You slink up behind, seemingly unnoticed.

2597
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:51,352
There's a slight twitch
to the mind flayer's head,

2598
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:53,029
for a second, as you go ahead,

2599
01:44:53,029 --> 01:44:54,856
and take a big ol'--

2600
01:44:54,856 --> 01:44:55,689
SAM: Bucket of shit!

2601
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:56,889
MATT: And fling it.

2602
01:44:56,889 --> 01:44:58,651
(all laugh)

2603
01:44:58,651 --> 01:45:01,722
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack roll.

2604
01:45:01,722 --> 01:45:05,222
It would be, you're not proficient with

2605
01:45:06,316 --> 01:45:08,793
goblin shit buckets, unfortunately,

2606
01:45:08,793 --> 01:45:10,049
so go ahead and roll a d20,

2607
01:45:10,049 --> 01:45:12,233
and add your dexterity.

2608
01:45:12,233 --> 01:45:13,753
ORION: (groans)

2609
01:45:13,753 --> 01:45:15,541
SAM: My dexterity?

2610
01:45:15,541 --> 01:45:17,147
MATT: Dexterity or strength, whichever's
higher, strength higher?

2611
01:45:17,147 --> 01:45:21,090
SAM: No, no, strength is not higher for me.

2612
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:22,075
Oh, it is higher!

2613
01:45:22,075 --> 01:45:22,908
So 19.

2614
01:45:23,953 --> 01:45:24,870
MATT: All righty.

2615
01:45:26,254 --> 01:45:27,204
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

2616
01:45:27,204 --> 01:45:29,981
MATT: You fling it as the Invisibility
spell wears off of you

2617
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:32,854
as part of the attack,
you fling the bucket.

2618
01:45:32,854 --> 01:45:36,511
A spray of thick, green,
goblin fecal matter

2619
01:45:36,511 --> 01:45:38,158
goes streaking through the air

2620
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:40,463
as the illithid turns, its eyes wide,

2621
01:45:40,463 --> 01:45:42,956
to see you suddenly appear,

2622
01:45:42,956 --> 01:45:45,882
and then suddenly see this
entire batch of thick goblin shit

2623
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:48,230
just (splashes) across its face.

2624
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:51,211
Suddenly you see his tentacles
writhing,

2625
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:54,241
as it screams, all of
you hear in your head

2626
01:45:54,241 --> 01:45:55,383
a scream.

2627
01:45:55,383 --> 01:45:57,677
LIAM: I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing!

2628
01:45:57,677 --> 01:45:59,389
ORION: I cast Stoneskin immediately.

2629
01:45:59,389 --> 01:46:01,505
MATT: As this happens, you cast Stoneskin,

2630
01:46:01,505 --> 01:46:02,461
you go in for the blade,

2631
01:46:02,461 --> 01:46:05,186
and you hear a counter voice in your mind.

2632
01:46:05,186 --> 01:46:06,019
ASHLEY: Fuck.

2633
01:46:06,019 --> 01:46:07,686
MATT: Clarota going, "Now."

2634
01:46:08,867 --> 01:46:12,116
MARISHA: I cast Light on Grog's head!

2635
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:14,318
MATT: Your head comes to an extremely bright glow,

2636
01:46:14,318 --> 01:46:15,662
all of you averting your gaze.

2637
01:46:15,662 --> 01:46:17,459
LIAM: This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?

2638
01:46:17,459 --> 01:46:19,703
MATT: No, you're invisible.

2639
01:46:19,703 --> 01:46:20,939
LIAM: Oh, okay.

2640
01:46:20,939 --> 01:46:22,329
SAM: Attack, attack, kill him!

2641
01:46:22,329 --> 01:46:23,162
LIAM: 29! 29!

2642
01:46:24,759 --> 01:46:26,536
MATT: That definitely rolls to
hit, you have surprise.

2643
01:46:26,536 --> 01:46:27,485
Go ahead and roll.

2644
01:46:27,485 --> 01:46:28,555
LIAM: That's a critical, right?

2645
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:29,706
I'm assassinating this mother fucker.

2646
01:46:29,706 --> 01:46:30,539
MATT: It's a critical, technically. Yep.

2647
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,622
SAM: We're going for the general?

2648
01:46:33,622 --> 01:46:36,455
LIAM: The illithid can control us all.

2649
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,593
ASHLEY: Should we go in?

2650
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:40,536
ORION: We don't know anything.

2651
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:41,697
MATT: So, roll damage on this.

2652
01:46:41,697 --> 01:46:42,971
LIAM: Roll my damage.

2653
01:46:42,971 --> 01:46:43,924
ORION: We just heard a scream.
Oh, we can act on that.

2654
01:46:43,924 --> 01:46:44,886
TRAVIS: And I rage.

2655
01:46:44,886 --> 01:46:45,800
MATT: Stone skin. Light on his head.

2656
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,958
TRAVIS: Rage.

2657
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:47,837
MATT: Going into a rage.

2658
01:46:47,837 --> 01:46:48,788
ASHLEY: Daylight on my shield.

2659
01:46:48,788 --> 01:46:49,836
MATT: Daylight on your shield.

2660
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:51,851
LAURA: I'm so happy to be here.

2661
01:46:51,851 --> 01:46:54,612
(all laugh)

2662
01:46:54,612 --> 01:46:56,330
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this battle,

2663
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,365
there is no Trinket here,

2664
01:46:57,365 --> 01:47:00,471
because Trinket would not have fit
across the way to get there.

2665
01:47:00,471 --> 01:47:01,304
LAURA: Okay.

2666
01:47:01,304 --> 01:47:02,677
TRAVIS: Didn't you give her an arrow?

2667
01:47:02,677 --> 01:47:05,415
TALIESIN: Yes, and you have an entrapment arrow 
now.

2668
01:47:05,415 --> 01:47:07,396
LAURA: Okay, I get ready for that.

2669
01:47:07,396 --> 01:47:08,313
LIAM: Okay, DM?

2670
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:10,451
62 into the back of his head.

2671
01:47:11,523 --> 01:47:12,832
TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

2672
01:47:12,832 --> 01:47:13,665
TRAVIS: 62?

2673
01:47:14,602 --> 01:47:15,956
ASHLEY: How?

2674
01:47:15,956 --> 01:47:17,206
LIAM: Critical hit.

2675
01:47:18,168 --> 01:47:20,849
MATT: You take the blade, and
as it pierces the back--

2676
01:47:20,849 --> 01:47:22,283
LIAM: Oh, it's a poison one by the way.

2677
01:47:22,283 --> 01:47:23,653
ORION: Damn!

2678
01:47:23,653 --> 01:47:25,290
MATT: It pierces the back of its skull,

2679
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,461
you feel the muscles in its neck

2680
01:47:26,461 --> 01:47:29,579
tense in reaction to the blade,
but the blade slips past.

2681
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:32,081
You can see a gout of purplish-black blood

2682
01:47:32,081 --> 01:47:32,997
begin to spill from its neck,

2683
01:47:32,997 --> 01:47:35,280
as it instinctually reaches up,

2684
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,306
and pulls the blade from
the back of its head.

2685
01:47:38,306 --> 01:47:40,003
What's the DC on the poison?

2686
01:47:40,003 --> 01:47:41,420
LIAM: I have no idea.

2687
01:47:42,982 --> 01:47:44,170
MATT: It should be on the blade info.

2688
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,503
LIAM: Poison dagger.

2689
01:47:46,367 --> 01:47:47,200
TALIESIN: Fuck.

2690
01:47:48,261 --> 01:47:49,094
Ah!

2691
01:47:49,094 --> 01:47:52,041
LIAM: I think it's oh, it's 15.

2692
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:52,874
TALIESIN: This was a good plan.

2693
01:47:52,874 --> 01:47:54,596
MATT: The poison does not seem to take effect,

2694
01:47:54,596 --> 01:47:56,103
the body resists it.

2695
01:47:56,103 --> 01:47:58,001
It is still alive.

2696
01:47:58,001 --> 01:48:00,210
But it's clutching the back of its neck,

2697
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,588
as it turns around going (sputters),

2698
01:48:02,588 --> 01:48:05,056
you can see its blood
spurting out of its mouth,

2699
01:48:05,056 --> 01:48:07,425
and its eyes are now
just burning with rage.

2700
01:48:07,425 --> 01:48:09,477
All the rest of these duergar are now reaching

2701
01:48:09,477 --> 01:48:11,889
and pulling their weapons out.

2702
01:48:11,889 --> 01:48:12,819
Everyone roll initiative.

2703
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:15,069
(all yell)

2704
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:18,155
LAURA: I don't have my stuff with me.

2705
01:48:18,155 --> 01:48:19,658
LIAM: Natural 20.

2706
01:48:19,658 --> 01:48:20,575
MATT: Oh, shit.

2707
01:48:24,143 --> 01:48:26,673
SAM: Let's kill some bad guys.

2708
01:48:26,673 --> 01:48:29,173
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're doing.

2709
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:32,777
MATT: All right, so.

2710
01:48:34,381 --> 01:48:35,214
25 to 20?

2711
01:48:36,291 --> 01:48:38,241
LIAM: 20. Natural 20.

2712
01:48:38,241 --> 01:48:39,074
MATT: But you have no bonuses?

2713
01:48:39,074 --> 01:48:40,585
You should have your dex bonus too.

2714
01:48:40,585 --> 01:48:42,502
LIAM: Oh yeah, that's a 25.

2715
01:48:43,457 --> 01:48:46,074
MATT: So, I'm gonna say you're
probably going in first, buddy.

2716
01:48:46,074 --> 01:48:47,045
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2717
01:48:47,045 --> 01:48:49,143
MATT: All right, 20, 25 to 20, anyone else?

2718
01:48:49,143 --> 01:48:50,864
LAURA: Oh, I think I got like a 21.

2719
01:48:50,864 --> 01:48:51,697
MATT: What'd you roll?

2720
01:48:51,697 --> 01:48:52,758
LAURA: I got 16 plus--

2721
01:48:52,758 --> 01:48:54,337
MATT: Yep, that'd be 21, yeah.

2722
01:48:54,337 --> 01:48:55,504
All right, so.

2723
01:49:00,795 --> 01:49:02,138
19, anyone?

2724
01:49:02,138 --> 01:49:02,972
TALIESIN: 19.

2725
01:49:02,972 --> 01:49:03,889
MATT: 19, nice.

2726
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:07,743
LAURA: No.

2727
01:49:10,144 --> 01:49:10,977
TALIESIN: Gonna wing it.

2728
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:11,810
MATT: 18, anyone?

2729
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:12,643
TRAVIS: 18.

2730
01:49:12,643 --> 01:49:13,476
MATT: Nice.

2731
01:49:13,476 --> 01:49:14,448
ORION: I got 16.

2732
01:49:14,448 --> 01:49:16,657
MARISHA: Do you have like a picture,

2733
01:49:16,657 --> 01:49:18,800
or a file anywhere, saved of your--

2734
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:19,838
LAURA: I got jack shit!

2735
01:49:19,838 --> 01:49:21,137
MARISHA: Of your sheet?

2736
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:23,367
LIAM: We snuck into the war camp.

2737
01:49:23,367 --> 01:49:24,534
LAURA: We're in the war camp?

2738
01:49:24,534 --> 01:49:27,135
LIAM: We all landed on the top
of their main building.

2739
01:49:27,135 --> 01:49:28,952
MATT: So, what's your?

2740
01:49:28,952 --> 01:49:30,388
SAM: 14.

2741
01:49:30,388 --> 01:49:31,221
ORION: I have 16.

2742
01:49:31,221 --> 01:49:32,388
MATT: 16, all right, so Tiberius.

2743
01:49:33,639 --> 01:49:35,956
Scanlan, what was yours?

2744
01:49:35,956 --> 01:49:37,148
ASHLEY: Nine.

2745
01:49:37,148 --> 01:49:38,390
MARISHA: Also nine.

2746
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:39,934
ASHLEY: Not to brag.

2747
01:49:39,934 --> 01:49:42,851
TRAVIS: Ashley's first two rolls were 20s.

2748
01:49:44,034 --> 01:49:47,427
MATT: All right, top of the round
is Vax, with initiative.

2749
01:49:47,427 --> 01:49:49,569
LIAM: I'm just gonna (grunts) in the
back of his head some more.

2750
01:49:49,569 --> 01:49:51,111
I'm still invisible according to Tiberius'

2751
01:49:51,111 --> 01:49:52,600
Greater Invisibility spell.

2752
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,253
ORION: No no no, as soon as I cast Stoneskin,

2753
01:49:56,253 --> 01:49:57,192
you were attacking,

2754
01:49:57,192 --> 01:49:58,495
that's why I said this is all going--

2755
01:49:58,495 --> 01:50:00,127
MATT: You are now visible, you are not stealthed.

2756
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:01,845
LIAM: Stab him in the back of the head.

2757
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:05,625
For assassinate, do I get
the critical still here, DM?

2758
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:06,458
MATT: No.

2759
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:08,823
You've gotten the one hit, it
is completely aware of you,

2760
01:50:08,823 --> 01:50:09,888
it is not a surprise attack.

2761
01:50:09,888 --> 01:50:10,938
LIAM: So this is a 28.

2762
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:12,336
MATT: It is so aware of you,

2763
01:50:12,336 --> 01:50:14,162
it has never been more
aware of you in its life.

2764
01:50:14,162 --> 01:50:15,800
(all laugh)

2765
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:16,995
LIAM: I just rolled a 28.

2766
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:19,006
MATT: Okay, that definitely hits.

2767
01:50:19,006 --> 01:50:21,654
Attacking with your off hand?

2768
01:50:21,654 --> 01:50:23,626
LIAM: Oh, so this is my bonus attack?

2769
01:50:23,626 --> 01:50:25,137
MATT: Yeah, you get the one attack,
then you get the bonus hand.

2770
01:50:25,137 --> 01:50:26,887
Which is just dice damage.

2771
01:50:27,869 --> 01:50:30,254
LIAM: Okay, this is fire.

2772
01:50:30,254 --> 01:50:35,120
My flame tongue dagger, I
got two plus six is eight.

2773
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,537
MATT: Eight?
LIAM: Eight.

2774
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:38,249
MATT: All right.

2775
01:50:40,637 --> 01:50:42,237
And your other attack?

2776
01:50:42,237 --> 01:50:43,070
Are you doing your bonus attack?

2777
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:44,262
LIAM: Was that the bonus attack?

2778
01:50:44,262 --> 01:50:45,306
Or was that my main attack?

2779
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:47,391
MATT: This is your new combat round,
that was your main attack.

2780
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:50,515
LIAM: That's a nine, and here
comes my bonus attack.

2781
01:50:50,515 --> 01:50:51,476
Okay, 14.

2782
01:50:51,476 --> 01:50:52,309
MARISHA: Kill him.

2783
01:50:52,309 --> 01:50:53,324
LIAM: 24.

2784
01:50:53,324 --> 01:50:54,157
MATT: 24 hits.

2785
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:58,204
LIAM: Here comes my keen dagger.

2786
01:50:58,204 --> 01:50:59,704
Which is an eight.

2787
01:51:01,392 --> 01:51:02,225
MATT: Eight damage?

2788
01:51:02,225 --> 01:51:03,058
LIAM: Yes.

2789
01:51:03,058 --> 01:51:03,933
MATT: So the first strike,

2790
01:51:03,933 --> 01:51:05,884
you swing across with
the flame tongue dagger.

2791
01:51:05,884 --> 01:51:07,511
As it backs up, you put another gash

2792
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:10,592
across the front of its
neck and chest area.

2793
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,754
It reels back and is looking
at you with angry fury.

2794
01:51:12,754 --> 01:51:14,832
You feel this coming shake,

2795
01:51:14,832 --> 01:51:17,351
this horrible force of severe retribution

2796
01:51:17,351 --> 01:51:20,298
coming to your mind, and
as you're bracing for it,

2797
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:21,571
you take your other blade,

2798
01:51:21,571 --> 01:51:24,351
you see its mouth opens up
with frustration and anger

2799
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,738
as its tentacles kinda curl back,

2800
01:51:25,738 --> 01:51:27,699
and just go in for the grab.

2801
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:29,907
You place the blade
squarely into that maw,

2802
01:51:29,907 --> 01:51:32,048
you feel the scraping of its
teeth across your knuckles,

2803
01:51:32,048 --> 01:51:32,881
but it doesn't matter,

2804
01:51:32,881 --> 01:51:35,648
because whatever anger and
light was once in its face,

2805
01:51:35,648 --> 01:51:36,680
goes dark and dull.

2806
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,229
(all cheer)

2807
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:39,633
MATT: As immediately it crumples to the ground,

2808
01:51:39,633 --> 01:51:42,877
lifeless, pull the blade from the maw,

2809
01:51:42,877 --> 01:51:44,003
mind flayer down.

2810
01:51:44,003 --> 01:51:45,951
(all cheer)

2811
01:51:45,951 --> 01:51:46,868
MARISHA: Yeah Vax!

2812
01:51:48,133 --> 01:51:50,142
MATT: He was next, but not anymore.

2813
01:51:50,142 --> 01:51:51,090
As it falls to the ground,

2814
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:54,340
all the rest of the duergar immediately

2815
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:57,338
have a reaction.

2816
01:51:57,338 --> 01:51:58,675
We'll get to their turn in a second.

2817
01:51:58,675 --> 01:51:59,705
Vex, you're up.

2818
01:51:59,705 --> 01:52:01,232
So you're on the roof, up here right now.

2819
01:52:01,232 --> 01:52:02,498
SAM: Gotta get inside first.

2820
01:52:02,498 --> 01:52:04,194
LAURA: We have to run down in?

2821
01:52:04,194 --> 01:52:06,383
MATT: Run down, you're on a wooden roof surface,

2822
01:52:06,383 --> 01:52:08,780
you heard before there's an entrance here,

2823
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,613
and an entrance there.

2824
01:52:09,613 --> 01:52:11,013
LIAM: Windows are swing-down-in-able.

2825
01:52:11,013 --> 01:52:14,763
SAM: Unless Grog can just
tear through the roof.

2826
01:52:16,846 --> 01:52:17,966
LAURA: What was your initiative?

2827
01:52:17,966 --> 01:52:18,984
LIAM: It's wood.

2828
01:52:18,984 --> 01:52:19,999
TALIESIN: You can hold initiative.

2829
01:52:19,999 --> 01:52:21,360
LAURA: I guess I'll hold, I'll hold,

2830
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,285
to see what the hell's happening.

2831
01:52:23,285 --> 01:52:25,469
MATT: So you hold on that.

2832
01:52:25,469 --> 01:52:28,949
It is now this dude's turn, the general.

2833
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:31,177
He, unaffected by this, it seems,

2834
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:34,606
just angrily leaps on to
the table, runs across,

2835
01:52:34,606 --> 01:52:38,662
(groans), and jumps down towards you.

2836
01:52:38,662 --> 01:52:42,829
As he does, you see his
physical form seems to enlarge.

2837
01:52:45,348 --> 01:52:47,989
His actual small dwarvish
form begins to swell,

2838
01:52:47,989 --> 01:52:49,207
his muscles tense.

2839
01:52:49,207 --> 01:52:50,544
He's about the size of a normal person,

2840
01:52:50,544 --> 01:52:52,207
if not a little bigger right now.

2841
01:52:52,207 --> 01:52:54,320
He comes at you with this giant black,

2842
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,320
jagged metal war hammer.

2843
01:52:57,276 --> 01:52:59,778
(groans) Comes down to swing at you,

2844
01:52:59,778 --> 01:53:02,952
as he comes down, you
see it burst into flame.

2845
01:53:02,952 --> 01:53:04,814
There's fire now surrounding
the head of this war hammer

2846
01:53:04,814 --> 01:53:05,970
as it arcs toward you.

2847
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,803
SAM: What?

2848
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:10,566
MATT: That is going to be a

2849
01:53:12,918 --> 01:53:13,751
24 to hit.

2850
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:15,602
LIAM: Oh, it hits, but I use Uncanny Dodge

2851
01:53:15,602 --> 01:53:18,280
to try to swoop out of
the way as best I can.

2852
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,280
MATT: All righty. You suffer--

2853
01:53:23,089 --> 01:53:25,122
That would be...

2854
01:53:25,122 --> 01:53:29,205
12 plus six fire damage,
so, 18, reduced to nine.

2855
01:53:30,702 --> 01:53:32,752
You take nine damage from the strike.

2856
01:53:32,752 --> 01:53:35,746
As it strikes down, it
goes for a back swing

2857
01:53:35,746 --> 01:53:37,629
to attack you a second time.

2858
01:53:37,629 --> 01:53:40,546
That is going to be a 15 versus AC.

2859
01:53:41,563 --> 01:53:44,122
This time you just dodge
completely out of the way.

2860
01:53:44,122 --> 01:53:45,412
Derge out of the way.

2861
01:53:45,412 --> 01:53:46,284
MARISHA: Derge.

2862
01:53:46,284 --> 01:53:48,231
LIAM: Er mah gerd, I derged.

2863
01:53:48,231 --> 01:53:49,925
(all laugh)

2864
01:53:49,925 --> 01:53:51,508
MATT: Percy, you're up.

2865
01:53:52,498 --> 01:53:54,603
TALIESIN: Just in case, I'm going to push off

2866
01:53:54,603 --> 01:53:55,717
and wait for Grog.

2867
01:53:55,717 --> 01:53:57,738
So I'm holding my turn.

2868
01:53:57,738 --> 01:54:00,074
MATT: Okay, Grog, your turn.

2869
01:54:00,074 --> 01:54:01,520
TRAVIS: Right, so we're on the
roof of the thing, right?

2870
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,353
MATT: Correct, you are.

2871
01:54:02,353 --> 01:54:05,777
TRAVIS: I'm in a rage, I take
the pot still on my head,

2872
01:54:05,777 --> 01:54:07,224
and I pick up my ax,

2873
01:54:07,224 --> 01:54:10,396
and I draw one gigantic
smash through the roof

2874
01:54:10,396 --> 01:54:11,229
of the building.

2875
01:54:11,229 --> 01:54:12,956
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

2876
01:54:12,956 --> 01:54:13,873
TALIESIN: God, yes.

2877
01:54:15,245 --> 01:54:16,693
ORION: This is all you're good for.

2878
01:54:16,693 --> 01:54:18,360
MARISHA: Yes, come on Grog.

2879
01:54:19,277 --> 01:54:21,081
This is all you're good for.

2880
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:24,001
TRAVIS: 15.

2881
01:54:24,001 --> 01:54:25,313
MATT: 15?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2882
01:54:25,313 --> 01:54:26,423
MATT: All right.

2883
01:54:26,423 --> 01:54:28,026
MARISHA: Come on.

2884
01:54:28,026 --> 01:54:28,859
SAM: 15?

2885
01:54:29,937 --> 01:54:32,115
MATT: You bring your ax up,

2886
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:33,464
you bring it down on
top as hard as you can,

2887
01:54:33,464 --> 01:54:35,552
go ahead and roll ax damage.

2888
01:54:35,552 --> 01:54:36,680
TRAVIS: Is that a d12?

2889
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,398
MATT: It's a d12 plus your strength modifier.

2890
01:54:39,398 --> 01:54:41,329
Plus two 'cause you're raging.

2891
01:54:41,329 --> 01:54:42,375
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on that?

2892
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:43,208
MATT: No.

2893
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:45,334
TRAVIS: Seven.

2894
01:54:45,334 --> 01:54:46,562
LAURA: Plus two 'cause you're raging.

2895
01:54:46,562 --> 01:54:47,395
TRAVIS: Nine.

2896
01:54:47,395 --> 01:54:48,560
MATT: Nine damage, okay.

2897
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,101
As you swing the ax down,
slam, it hits the wood.

2898
01:54:51,101 --> 01:54:52,968
With the sheer weight of you there,

2899
01:54:52,968 --> 01:54:54,646
and most of you guys conglomerated
at that point,

2900
01:54:54,646 --> 01:54:57,857
the actual roof breaks open and splits,

2901
01:54:57,857 --> 01:54:58,985
into a small space.

2902
01:54:58,985 --> 01:55:01,872
You slide down in the process.

2903
01:55:01,872 --> 01:55:04,400
ASHLEY: I jump on to Grog's foot.

2904
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,542
(all laugh)

2905
01:55:06,542 --> 01:55:07,850
MATT: All right.

2906
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:10,812
Go ahead, both of you
make an acrobatics check.

2907
01:55:10,812 --> 01:55:12,405
ASHLEY: Oh, I wouldn't have had to do it.

2908
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:14,840
All right, well, I'm in the building.

2909
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,385
TRAVIS: 21.

2910
01:55:16,385 --> 01:55:17,218
MATT: Acrobatics check?

2911
01:55:17,218 --> 01:55:18,051
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2912
01:55:18,051 --> 01:55:18,893
MATT: Pike?

2913
01:55:18,893 --> 01:55:22,168
You have disadvantage 'cause
you're in plate armor.

2914
01:55:22,168 --> 01:55:23,107
ASHLEY: Six.

2915
01:55:23,107 --> 01:55:25,855
MATT: All right, so Grog, you
manage to land on your feet.

2916
01:55:25,855 --> 01:55:28,256
Pike, you actually
plummet off and fall off

2917
01:55:28,256 --> 01:55:30,036
to the side, right there.

2918
01:55:30,036 --> 01:55:31,968
You are currently prone,
and from the fall,

2919
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,189
which you guys both dropped down,

2920
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:34,151
you managed to reduce the damage,

2921
01:55:34,151 --> 01:55:38,149
but you from the fall, you take
eight points of fall damage.

2922
01:55:38,149 --> 01:55:39,087
You are now flat on your back,

2923
01:55:39,087 --> 01:55:42,074
the wind knocked out of you for a minute.

2924
01:55:42,074 --> 01:55:43,325
SAM: Pike!

2925
01:55:43,325 --> 01:55:44,494
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay!

2926
01:55:44,494 --> 01:55:45,910
SAM: Oh okay, thank God.

2927
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:46,743
MATT: All right.

2928
01:55:47,705 --> 01:55:51,288
That brings us now,
Vex and Percy are the same.

2929
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:54,114
TALIESIN: You first? Or should I go first?

2930
01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:55,121
LAURA: Let's go down at the same time.

2931
01:55:55,121 --> 01:55:56,879
TALIESIN: We'll go, we both jump
down at the same time.

2932
01:55:56,879 --> 01:55:57,712
MATT: Both jump down,

2933
01:55:57,712 --> 01:56:01,471
go ahead and make your
acrobatics checks, guys.

2934
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:02,304
TALIESIN: 20.

2935
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,022
LAURA: Oh, I rolled really bad.

2936
01:56:05,022 --> 01:56:05,855
MATT: What did you roll?

2937
01:56:05,855 --> 01:56:09,075
LAURA: I rolled a two, but I
add it to my acrobatics.

2938
01:56:09,075 --> 01:56:10,094
MATT: Yes, which is?

2939
01:56:10,094 --> 01:56:10,927
SAM: Which you don't know.

2940
01:56:10,927 --> 01:56:12,485
LAURA: Which is like, I bet.

2941
01:56:12,485 --> 01:56:13,747
MATT: Your acrobatics, as you're proficient in it,

2942
01:56:13,747 --> 01:56:14,838
and you have plus five dex,

2943
01:56:14,838 --> 01:56:16,647
so that would bring it to 11?

2944
01:56:16,647 --> 01:56:17,480
LAURA: Yes.

2945
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,313
MATT: Or no, 12.

2946
01:56:18,313 --> 01:56:19,171
LAURA: Yes.

2947
01:56:19,171 --> 01:56:20,858
LIAM: Did you bring any Wheaton
power from the other room?

2948
01:56:20,858 --> 01:56:23,258
(all laugh)

2949
01:56:23,258 --> 01:56:24,917
MATT: You just barely land on your feet,

2950
01:56:24,917 --> 01:56:27,227
you do take fall damage,
but you don't fall prone.

2951
01:56:27,227 --> 01:56:29,987
You take eight points of fall damage.

2952
01:56:29,987 --> 01:56:31,788
Percy, you manage to land fine,

2953
01:56:31,788 --> 01:56:33,971
without any damage, on your feet.

2954
01:56:33,971 --> 01:56:36,950
On the ground, both of you
kind of three-point landing.

2955
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:38,287
Avengers style.

2956
01:56:38,287 --> 01:56:40,533
TALIESIN: Do I have time to get a shot off?

2957
01:56:40,533 --> 01:56:43,283
MATT: You do, that was your movement.

2958
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:45,813
So what's the deal?

2959
01:56:45,813 --> 01:56:47,651
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm taking a second,

2960
01:56:47,651 --> 01:56:51,022
and I see that Vax is getting attacked,

2961
01:56:51,022 --> 01:56:53,064
and I'm gonna just take a shot at the--

2962
01:56:53,064 --> 01:56:55,743
The guy with the hammer.

2963
01:56:55,743 --> 01:56:57,455
The biggest thing I see.

2964
01:56:57,455 --> 01:57:00,910
MATT: Do you have your glasses or goggles on?

2965
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:02,891
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right, I have a helmet.

2966
01:57:02,891 --> 01:57:04,414
So yeah, I'm wearing the helmet.

2967
01:57:04,414 --> 01:57:05,720
I'm cool with that.

2968
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,642
MATT: So go for it.

2969
01:57:07,642 --> 01:57:09,059
LIAM: Do it, Starlord.

2970
01:57:10,971 --> 01:57:12,314
TALIESIN: Ah! A natural 20.

2971
01:57:12,314 --> 01:57:13,330
(all cheer)

2972
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:15,816
MATT: Against the general,
or one of the duergar?

2973
01:57:15,816 --> 01:57:16,706
TALIESIN: The general.

2974
01:57:16,706 --> 01:57:19,340
LIAM: The guy on the table attacking me.

2975
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:20,988
MATT: Yeah, you can just barely see him,

2976
01:57:20,988 --> 01:57:22,193
the stairway is up there.

2977
01:57:22,193 --> 01:57:24,198
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter, as long
as I have-- partial cover,

2978
01:57:24,198 --> 01:57:25,031
it don't matter.

2979
01:57:25,031 --> 01:57:26,123
MATT: Right, I know, and he does have,

2980
01:57:26,123 --> 01:57:28,056
he has three-quarters cover
because of the distance,

2981
01:57:28,056 --> 01:57:29,514
but you natural 20'd, so it doesn't matter.

2982
01:57:29,514 --> 01:57:32,712
TALIESIN: I can ignore it, I ignore
three-quarters cover.

2983
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:33,830
MATT: You do, because--

2984
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:34,663
TALIESIN: I'm awesome.

2985
01:57:34,663 --> 01:57:35,496
MATT: Yep.

2986
01:57:35,496 --> 01:57:36,689
(all laugh)

2987
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:39,819
TALIESIN: So that's double 1d-- I should have gotten

2988
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:42,700
some bonuses on that, I'm an idiot.

2989
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:43,533
Plus five.

2990
01:57:44,687 --> 01:57:46,303
It's just double dice damage?

2991
01:57:46,303 --> 01:57:49,147
MATT: Double dice damage, then add your modifier.

2992
01:57:49,147 --> 01:57:49,980
MARISHA: Woo!

2993
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,240
TALIESIN: That's 19 points of damage.

2994
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,273
MATT: To the general, nice.

2995
01:57:53,273 --> 01:57:54,428
MARISHA: Nice.

2996
01:57:54,428 --> 01:57:55,479
MATT: (explosion)

2997
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:56,888
He gets shot in the back
of the shoulderplate,

2998
01:57:56,888 --> 01:57:57,966
you hear it ricochet and a little bit

2999
01:57:57,966 --> 01:58:00,227
of blood begins to streak
off the back of his head.

3000
01:58:00,227 --> 01:58:01,679
He looks over his shoulder
with an angry grunt,

3001
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,785
you can see now this dwarf,
who's still swelling in size.

3002
01:58:04,785 --> 01:58:08,952
It looks, (growls), an
angry nostril flare.

3003
01:58:10,245 --> 01:58:11,710
You, have your bow ready?

3004
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:14,541
LAURA: I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy

3005
01:58:14,541 --> 01:58:15,894
attacking my brother.

3006
01:58:15,894 --> 01:58:16,727
MATT: That guy there?

3007
01:58:16,727 --> 01:58:17,560
LAURA: Yeah.

3008
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:21,353
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.

3009
01:58:21,353 --> 01:58:22,882
LAURA: Ugh, I don't think I hit.

3010
01:58:22,882 --> 01:58:23,715
MATT: What'd you roll?

3011
01:58:23,715 --> 01:58:24,735
LAURA: I had rolled a four.

3012
01:58:24,735 --> 01:58:27,397
MATT: A four, you had a plus 11 to hit,

3013
01:58:27,397 --> 01:58:29,417
it's going to be a 15,
unfortunately you miss.

3014
01:58:29,417 --> 01:58:31,334
The arrow streaks past.

3015
01:58:34,428 --> 01:58:36,699
Yeah, the arrow just ended up
striking the wall back here

3016
01:58:36,699 --> 01:58:38,870
and (explosion) arcs
lightning throughout the wall,

3017
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:39,703
unfortunately does not--

3018
01:58:39,703 --> 01:58:42,491
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him anyway,
just for future stuff.

3019
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:43,324
MATT: You used your--

3020
01:58:43,324 --> 01:58:44,171
LAURA: That was a bon--

3021
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:46,244
MATT: You used your bonus action
to cast Lightning Arrow.

3022
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:47,702
LAURA: Oh! So I get a regular attack now?

3023
01:58:47,702 --> 01:58:48,801
MATT: Well, that was part of your regular attack,

3024
01:58:48,801 --> 01:58:49,877
like your next arrow you fired.

3025
01:58:49,877 --> 01:58:51,096
LAURA: I get it.

3026
01:58:51,096 --> 01:58:52,244
(all laugh)

3027
01:58:52,244 --> 01:58:53,563
TALIESIN: You're going off-book, this is cool.

3028
01:58:53,563 --> 01:58:56,768
MATT: I think, let me double-check
real fast, just to be sure.

3029
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:58,750
Because I don't wanna screw
you out of a cool turn.

3030
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,000
LAURA: That is mine!

3031
01:59:01,282 --> 01:59:02,462
MATT: Next time bring your sheet.

3032
01:59:02,462 --> 01:59:03,295
LAURA: I'm sorry.

3033
01:59:03,295 --> 01:59:04,128
MATT: That's okay.

3034
01:59:04,128 --> 01:59:05,134
Yeah that's a bonus
action to cast lightning,

3035
01:59:05,134 --> 01:59:06,265
into your next arrow you fire,

3036
01:59:06,265 --> 01:59:07,647
however, you do have two attacks.

3037
01:59:07,647 --> 01:59:08,772
So you can shoot a second time.

3038
01:59:08,772 --> 01:59:11,964
It just isn't affected by Lightning Arrow.

3039
01:59:11,964 --> 01:59:13,073
LAURA: I roll 14.

3040
01:59:13,073 --> 01:59:14,387
MATT: That does hit, go ahead and roll
damage

3041
01:59:14,387 --> 01:59:15,507
there's 1d10, plus--

3042
01:59:15,507 --> 01:59:17,039
LAURA: I think it was 1d8, actually.

3043
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:20,453
MATT: Oh, for the longbow?
Okay, 1d8 plus five for your dex,

3044
01:59:20,453 --> 01:59:22,329
and then plus two for the bow.

3045
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:23,848
Plus seven.

3046
01:59:23,848 --> 01:59:24,754
LAURA: Ten.

3047
01:59:24,754 --> 01:59:26,072
MATT: Ten damage, all right.

3048
01:59:26,072 --> 01:59:28,727
So first arrow just
streaks off, hits the wall.

3049
01:59:28,727 --> 01:59:29,749
As he's kind of staring at Percy,

3050
01:59:29,749 --> 01:59:30,811
he looks towards you, and as he does,

3051
01:59:30,811 --> 01:59:31,915
the second arrow

3052
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:33,408
sticks into the plate,
he kinda looks at it.

3053
01:59:33,408 --> 01:59:34,445
(grunts)

3054
01:59:34,445 --> 01:59:36,828
Just snaps it off in the armor.

3055
01:59:36,828 --> 01:59:38,519
Grabbing his two-handed sword, or sorry,

3056
01:59:38,519 --> 01:59:41,838
the war hammer in the other hand.

3057
01:59:41,838 --> 01:59:44,029
Minis, it's confusing.

3058
01:59:44,029 --> 01:59:47,007
All right, that ends your turn.

3059
01:59:47,007 --> 01:59:50,177
Grog, the light that is
beaming from your helmet

3060
01:59:50,177 --> 01:59:52,120
currently right now is
filling up the room,

3061
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,781
and it is extremely bright,
most of you guys can handle it.

3062
01:59:55,781 --> 01:59:58,605
You see all the duergar at
the table like (groans),

3063
01:59:58,605 --> 01:59:59,952
bunch of duergar come running in as well,

3064
01:59:59,952 --> 02:00:01,614
as they run in, they're
having to shield their eyes,

3065
02:00:01,614 --> 02:00:04,330
but it's actually physically hurting them

3066
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:05,424
to be in that room right now.

3067
02:00:05,424 --> 02:00:06,692
They're like (groans).

3068
02:00:06,692 --> 02:00:09,505
Keeping it at bay, this
one attempts to run in,

3069
02:00:09,505 --> 02:00:12,381
this one's kind of making its way over.

3070
02:00:12,381 --> 02:00:15,088
These guys here, this one's
gonna go ahead and run here,

3071
02:00:15,088 --> 02:00:16,873
this one's gonna go
ahead and come to Grog.

3072
02:00:16,873 --> 02:00:20,445
These two are gonna come up behind.

3073
02:00:20,445 --> 02:00:22,086
SAM: Is that guy the general?

3074
02:00:22,086 --> 02:00:23,504
MATT: That guy's the general, yes.

3075
02:00:23,504 --> 02:00:25,312
This one's gonna come up behind to you.

3076
02:00:25,312 --> 02:00:29,164
All right, they have
disadvantage on their attacks.

3077
02:00:29,164 --> 02:00:30,100
ORION: Nice.

3078
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:31,523
MATT: Because of the light.

3079
02:00:31,523 --> 02:00:33,799
(all cheer)

3080
02:00:33,799 --> 02:00:35,908
TRAVIS: 'Cause I'm so bright.

3081
02:00:35,908 --> 02:00:37,683
MATT: Attack against you.

3082
02:00:37,683 --> 02:00:40,274
MARISHA: You're the brightest
tool in the shed today.

3083
02:00:40,274 --> 02:00:42,357
MATT: That is a 17 versus AC.

3084
02:00:43,932 --> 02:00:46,543
You just dodge out of the way.

3085
02:00:46,543 --> 02:00:49,050
Next one, its
war pick against you, Grog.

3086
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:50,879
ASHLEY: Get skinny, get skinny.

3087
02:00:50,879 --> 02:00:52,489
MATT: That is

3088
02:00:52,489 --> 02:00:53,795
20 versus AC?

3089
02:00:53,795 --> 02:00:54,628
TRAVIS: That hits.

3090
02:00:54,628 --> 02:00:56,357
MATT: That hits, all right.

3091
02:00:56,357 --> 02:00:58,940
You take eight points of damage

3092
02:01:00,545 --> 02:01:02,604
as it slams you with its
war pick in the chest,

3093
02:01:02,604 --> 02:01:03,802
you can feel it kind of gets about

3094
02:01:03,802 --> 02:01:05,017
a half an inch of depth into it,

3095
02:01:05,017 --> 02:01:06,005
but you just kind of shrug it off,

3096
02:01:06,005 --> 02:01:08,130
and flex your muscles and it
pops it out of your torso.

3097
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,297
TRAVIS: That's cute.

3098
02:01:10,427 --> 02:01:12,260
MATT: The two against you.

3099
02:01:15,179 --> 02:01:17,346
That'll be a 19 versus AC.

3100
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,261
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that hits for sure.

3101
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:22,518
MATT: And a 17 versus AC.

3102
02:01:22,518 --> 02:01:23,351
LAURA: That--

3103
02:01:24,206 --> 02:01:25,039
hits.

3104
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:26,345
MATT: All right, so you take two hits.

3105
02:01:26,345 --> 02:01:27,928
That's 11 damage.

3106
02:01:29,217 --> 02:01:32,817
And 13 damage as both of them
start whaling you from behind

3107
02:01:32,817 --> 02:01:33,872
with war picks.

3108
02:01:33,872 --> 02:01:35,108
LIAM: Vex'ahlia!

3109
02:01:35,953 --> 02:01:36,871
I yell.

3110
02:01:36,871 --> 02:01:38,038
LAURA: 13 and what?

3111
02:01:39,468 --> 02:01:40,754
MATT: All right.

3112
02:01:40,754 --> 02:01:43,235
Next up is the one that's attacking you.

3113
02:01:43,235 --> 02:01:44,068
SAM: Scanlan.

3114
02:01:44,068 --> 02:01:46,910
MATT: Scanlan, that's going to
be, at a disadvantage,

3115
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:48,853
a 15 versus armor class.

3116
02:01:48,853 --> 02:01:49,686
SAM: 14.

3117
02:01:49,686 --> 02:01:51,756
MATT: 14? That still strikes you.

3118
02:01:51,756 --> 02:01:54,085
You take eight points of
damage from the war pick.

3119
02:01:54,085 --> 02:01:55,845
Slamming you over the shoulder.

3120
02:01:55,845 --> 02:01:58,077
SAM: (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike!

3121
02:01:58,077 --> 02:02:00,327
(all laugh)

3122
02:02:02,016 --> 02:02:04,319
MATT: That ends their go, Tiberius, you're up.

3123
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:05,471
ORION: I'm still on the roof, right?

3124
02:02:05,471 --> 02:02:06,730
MATT: You're still on the roof, yes.

3125
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:09,073
ORION: What can I see, like if I go down,

3126
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:10,421
what can I see?

3127
02:02:10,421 --> 02:02:11,442
MATT: You look through the hole,

3128
02:02:11,442 --> 02:02:13,069
and you can see pretty much
the entire battlefield.

3129
02:02:13,069 --> 02:02:14,740
You're just up here
looking down through it.

3130
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:16,210
ORION: Oh, wonderful.

3131
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:17,565
MATT: You're currently the
only one still up there.

3132
02:02:17,565 --> 02:02:20,422
ORION: Yes, I think I'll stay right
here, thank you very much.

3133
02:02:20,422 --> 02:02:23,126
And how tall is the roof?

3134
02:02:23,126 --> 02:02:24,376
How high is it?

3135
02:02:25,691 --> 02:02:26,524
15 feet?

3136
02:02:26,524 --> 02:02:29,285
MATT: It's about 25 feet up?

3137
02:02:29,285 --> 02:02:31,702
ORION: Okay, wonderful, wonderful.

3138
02:02:33,021 --> 02:02:35,164
So, let me see here.

3139
02:02:35,164 --> 02:02:36,331
This is fun.

3140
02:02:37,621 --> 02:02:40,141
MATT: You are technically, because I can do it.

3141
02:02:40,141 --> 02:02:41,793
TALIESIN: Gonna use one of the
little lifties, aren't you?

3142
02:02:41,793 --> 02:02:42,626
MATT: I am.

3143
02:02:43,493 --> 02:02:44,359
MARISHA: Finally.

3144
02:02:44,359 --> 02:02:45,779
LIAM: Bring the fire, Tiberus.

3145
02:02:45,779 --> 02:02:46,612
SAM: Oh.

3146
02:02:50,644 --> 02:02:51,477
Toys.

3147
02:02:51,477 --> 02:02:53,685
MARISHA: Now he's getting out toys.

3148
02:02:53,685 --> 02:02:54,518
TALIESIN: Aw yeah.

3149
02:02:54,518 --> 02:02:57,101
SAM: Come on, do something.

3150
02:02:57,101 --> 02:02:58,145
ORION: I'm waiting for him to do something,

3151
02:02:58,145 --> 02:02:58,989
'cause it's so cool.

3152
02:02:58,989 --> 02:03:00,632
MARISHA: I got him this for
Christmas two years ago,

3153
02:03:00,632 --> 02:03:01,580
and he's finally using it.

3154
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:02,413
MATT: You are up here right now.

3155
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:05,963
ORION: Awesome.

3156
02:03:05,963 --> 02:03:06,894
TRAVIS: Three-dimensional fighting.

3157
02:03:06,894 --> 02:03:08,625
LIAM: Toys, toys.

3158
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:10,129
MATT: Is that visible?

3159
02:03:10,129 --> 02:03:11,629
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3160
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,210
Sweet D&amp;D rave.

3161
02:03:15,992 --> 02:03:17,364
ORION: Okay.

3162
02:03:17,364 --> 02:03:18,614
I'm going to--

3163
02:03:19,732 --> 02:03:22,504
I see the two guards behind Vex, right?

3164
02:03:22,504 --> 02:03:23,440
Is that what's going on?

3165
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:24,273
MATT: Yep, right there.

3166
02:03:24,273 --> 02:03:26,399
ORION: And then the one duergar in front of Grog?

3167
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:27,232
Is that what's going on, too?

3168
02:03:27,232 --> 02:03:28,065
MATT: Yep, right there.

3169
02:03:28,065 --> 02:03:30,288
Great, I will cast

3170
02:03:30,288 --> 02:03:32,399
Grand Columns

3171
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:35,142
under all three of those
dudes, and pin 'em.

3172
02:03:35,142 --> 02:03:38,057
Right up against the roof.

3173
02:03:38,057 --> 02:03:39,162
With my columns.

3174
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:39,995
LIAM: Clever girl.

3175
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:40,828
MATT: The?

3176
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:43,228
ORION: Pillars, yes.

3177
02:03:43,228 --> 02:03:44,889
MATT: But those pillars only go 15 feet up.

3178
02:03:44,889 --> 02:03:47,264
ORION: No, they go up to 25.

3179
02:03:47,264 --> 02:03:48,194
MATT: 25? Oh nice.

3180
02:03:48,194 --> 02:03:49,027
ORION: Yeah.

3181
02:03:49,027 --> 02:03:49,938
MATT: Okay.

3182
02:03:49,938 --> 02:03:52,044
ORION: That's why I always ask that question.

3183
02:03:53,393 --> 02:03:57,077
It does 66 bludgeoning
damage when it's pinned.

3184
02:03:57,077 --> 02:03:57,957
ASHLEY: Bye bye.

3185
02:03:57,957 --> 02:04:00,718
SAM: If they don't make their save.

3186
02:04:00,718 --> 02:04:02,069
MATT: All right, so.

3187
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:04,948
Go ahead and what is your DC on that?

3188
02:04:04,948 --> 02:04:05,959
Your spell DC?

3189
02:04:05,959 --> 02:04:06,792
ORION: 17.

3190
02:04:06,792 --> 02:04:07,959
MATT: 17, all right.

3191
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:16,536
All right, the heartiness
of the duergar resilience

3192
02:04:16,536 --> 02:04:19,365
gives them advantage on
saves against spells.

3193
02:04:19,365 --> 02:04:21,639
They all make their saves.

3194
02:04:21,639 --> 02:04:22,472
SAM: What?

3195
02:04:23,357 --> 02:04:26,085
MATT: But they are still up
on these platforms now,

3196
02:04:26,085 --> 02:04:27,984
raised above.

3197
02:04:27,984 --> 02:04:29,067
So what is--

3198
02:04:31,193 --> 02:04:33,157
Does it do any damage if
they make their saves?

3199
02:04:33,157 --> 02:04:35,740
ORION: (reading)

3200
02:04:37,157 --> 02:04:38,741
SAM: Come on iPhone, come on iphone!

3201
02:04:39,964 --> 02:04:41,291
MARISHA: You're supposed to know everything!

3202
02:04:41,291 --> 02:04:42,458
SAM: iPhone five!

3203
02:04:43,894 --> 02:04:44,977
This is the Fifth Edition.

3204
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:45,907
ORION: Why doesn't it say?

3205
02:04:45,907 --> 02:04:47,436
I guess it doesn't.

3206
02:04:47,436 --> 02:04:48,686
It doesn't say.

3207
02:04:49,936 --> 02:04:51,185
MATT: So they are currently--

3208
02:04:51,185 --> 02:04:52,380
SAM: What is this madness?

3209
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,880
TALIESIN: Oh, you're crazy.

3210
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:57,292
ORION: Oh, wait a minute, no.

3211
02:04:58,126 --> 02:04:59,285
You make this call.

3212
02:04:59,285 --> 02:05:01,204
If a pillar is prevented
from reaching its full height

3213
02:05:01,204 --> 02:05:02,636
because of a ceiling or other obstacle,

3214
02:05:02,636 --> 02:05:04,697
a creature on the pillar
takes 66 bludgeoning damage

3215
02:05:04,697 --> 02:05:07,029
and is restrained, pinched
between the pillar and obstacle.

3216
02:05:07,029 --> 02:05:08,802
The restrained creature can use an action

3217
02:05:08,802 --> 02:05:10,299
to make a strength or dexterity check

3218
02:05:10,299 --> 02:05:12,475
against the spell save DC. On a success they are

3219
02:05:12,475 --> 02:05:14,523
no longer restrained, and must
either move off the pole,

3220
02:05:14,523 --> 02:05:15,661
or fall off of it.

3221
02:05:15,661 --> 02:05:17,393
So they still, it still happens,

3222
02:05:17,393 --> 02:05:19,053
but they're not pinned by it.

3223
02:05:19,053 --> 02:05:19,886
Got you, okay.

3224
02:05:19,886 --> 02:05:21,396
So go ahead and roll
damage for all of them.

3225
02:05:21,396 --> 02:05:22,284
MARISHA: Woo!

3226
02:05:22,284 --> 02:05:23,275
MATT: Good to know.

3227
02:05:23,275 --> 02:05:24,898
(sings) New spells that just got released.

3228
02:05:24,898 --> 02:05:27,295
LIAM: There's magic in the dwarves.

3229
02:05:27,295 --> 02:05:28,609
SAM: Magic in them.

3230
02:05:28,609 --> 02:05:30,477
LIAM: The duergar.

3231
02:05:30,477 --> 02:05:33,021
MARISHA: ♫ A whole new spell

3232
02:05:33,021 --> 02:05:36,499
TALIESIN: ♫ A fantastic way to die

3233
02:05:36,499 --> 02:05:38,702
MARISHA: ♫ No one can tell us no

3234
02:05:38,702 --> 02:05:39,535
ORION: 27 damage.

3235
02:05:39,535 --> 02:05:41,207
MARISHA: ♫ Except for Matt

3236
02:05:41,207 --> 02:05:43,993
(all laugh)

3237
02:05:43,993 --> 02:05:47,239
MATT: All three of the duergar are crushed.

3238
02:05:47,239 --> 02:05:48,323
SAM: To death?

3239
02:05:48,323 --> 02:05:49,226
MATT: Against the ceiling.

3240
02:05:49,226 --> 02:05:50,210
ORION: I did 27 damage to each one.

3241
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,864
TRAVIS: Nice!

3242
02:05:51,864 --> 02:05:54,062
MATT: Splat, splat, splat, they're all slammed
into the ceiling,

3243
02:05:54,062 --> 02:05:57,062
you can see limp dwarf arms and legs

3244
02:05:57,908 --> 02:05:59,624
now dangling out of the stone pillars

3245
02:05:59,624 --> 02:06:01,594
that are now permanently
embedding them into the ceiling.

3246
02:06:01,594 --> 02:06:02,439
LIAM: Yeah, son.

3247
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:03,400
SAM: Crazy room!

3248
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:05,361
ORION: I go like this, hah!

3249
02:06:05,361 --> 02:06:08,028
I use two of my sorcerer points,

3250
02:06:09,088 --> 02:06:10,521
and I cast Quicken Spell,

3251
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:13,827
and I look at the general, and I--

3252
02:06:13,827 --> 02:06:16,007
Because of my books I've
been tampering with,

3253
02:06:16,007 --> 02:06:18,174
I cast Blight on his eyes.

3254
02:06:19,686 --> 02:06:20,519
Okay.

3255
02:06:20,519 --> 02:06:22,184
'Cause I wanna.

3256
02:06:22,184 --> 02:06:23,986
(all laugh)

3257
02:06:23,986 --> 02:06:25,593
MATT: What's the-- the DC is 17, you said?

3258
02:06:25,593 --> 02:06:27,179
ORION: Yes.

3259
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:28,589
MATT: All right, natural 20.

3260
02:06:28,589 --> 02:06:29,422
So he makes his save.

3261
02:06:29,422 --> 02:06:31,735
(all groan)

3262
02:06:31,735 --> 02:06:34,203
ORION: He takes 8d8 damage, and if he saves,

3263
02:06:34,203 --> 02:06:35,606
he takes half the damage.

3264
02:06:35,606 --> 02:06:36,439
MATT: Okay.

3265
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:39,232
ORION: 10, 15.

3266
02:06:41,366 --> 02:06:42,992
LIAM: They were all eights, right?

3267
02:06:42,992 --> 02:06:44,716
MARISHA: Well, he does all of them 
and then divides.

3268
02:06:44,716 --> 02:06:45,549
SAM: But you said half.

3269
02:06:45,549 --> 02:06:46,976
MARISHA: He rolls all of them and then divides.

3270
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:48,149
SAM: I see.

3271
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:50,964
ORION: 15 plus, what is that, ten, 14.

3272
02:06:50,964 --> 02:06:51,830
MARISHA: Your first one was--

3273
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:52,663
ORION: 29?

3274
02:06:54,035 --> 02:06:57,651
MATT: So we'll say a solid 14 points of damage.

3275
02:06:57,651 --> 02:06:58,984
All right, gotcha.

3276
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:03,310
No other effect, just the
damage from Blight, right?

3277
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:05,653
ORION: Yeah, because he made his save.

3278
02:07:05,653 --> 02:07:06,559
MATT: All right, Scanlan, you're up.

3279
02:07:06,559 --> 02:07:07,979
SAM: Oh, okay.

3280
02:07:07,979 --> 02:07:10,973
I'm going to, (groans).

3281
02:07:10,973 --> 02:07:13,264
God there's so few people to kill now.

3282
02:07:13,264 --> 02:07:14,910
(all laugh)

3283
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,829
SAM: You did it all, is it
just us and the general?

3284
02:07:16,829 --> 02:07:18,126
LAURA: Wait, that guy behind you though.

3285
02:07:18,126 --> 02:07:19,132
MATT: Just you guys, the general.

3286
02:07:19,132 --> 02:07:21,349
There's a guy right behind you.

3287
02:07:21,349 --> 02:07:22,622
Those guys got slammed.

3288
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:27,287
SAM: Okay, I'm gonna cast

3289
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:32,589
Dominate Person on the general.

3290
02:07:32,589 --> 02:07:34,423
TRAIVS: (laughs) What does that do?

3291
02:07:34,423 --> 02:07:35,821
ORION: Oh shit.

3292
02:07:35,821 --> 02:07:36,654
TALIESIN: No.

3293
02:07:36,654 --> 02:07:38,386
LIAM: He's a power top.

3294
02:07:38,386 --> 02:07:39,867
MATT: With advantage, he
rolled a one and a two,

3295
02:07:39,867 --> 02:07:40,700
on the saving throw.

3296
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,459
(all cheer)

3297
02:07:42,459 --> 02:07:44,271
MATT: That's ridiculous, okay.

3298
02:07:44,271 --> 02:07:45,689
SAM: I'm going to

3299
02:07:45,689 --> 02:07:47,771
Dominate him and inform him,

3300
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:50,015
I can give him a command, right?

3301
02:07:50,015 --> 02:07:50,848
Yes.

3302
02:07:50,848 --> 02:07:51,681
ORION: You can make him do whatever.

3303
02:07:51,681 --> 02:07:53,687
SAM: I'm going to tell him to stand down,

3304
02:07:53,687 --> 02:07:57,104
and tell all of his allies to stand down.

3305
02:07:58,233 --> 02:07:59,066
MATT: All right.

3306
02:08:01,653 --> 02:08:03,626
He turns around.

3307
02:08:03,626 --> 02:08:06,524
Gives you a look, a strange look, he goes.

3308
02:08:06,524 --> 02:08:09,524
"Men, all of you, drop your weapons!

3309
02:08:10,392 --> 02:08:11,225
"Now.

3310
02:08:12,078 --> 02:08:16,258
"We are surrendering to
our new infiltrators."

3311
02:08:16,258 --> 02:08:19,508
He throws his war hammer to the ground.

3312
02:08:21,085 --> 02:08:23,402
The rest of them all kind of look around.

3313
02:08:23,402 --> 02:08:26,077
Go ahead and, I'm gonna have
you make intimidation check

3314
02:08:26,077 --> 02:08:27,000
on his behalf.

3315
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,407
SAM: Okay, on his behalf?

3316
02:08:28,407 --> 02:08:29,240
MATT: Yes.

3317
02:08:31,002 --> 02:08:32,293
SAM: Do I add mine?

3318
02:08:32,293 --> 02:08:35,243
MATT: No, I'm just considering
that, so you rolled 11?

3319
02:08:35,243 --> 02:08:36,076
SAM: 11.

3320
02:08:39,831 --> 02:08:41,998
(sings along with the music)

3321
02:08:43,392 --> 02:08:45,242
MATT: The three other duergar look confused,

3322
02:08:45,242 --> 02:08:46,496
look at the dead mind flayer,

3323
02:08:46,496 --> 02:08:47,910
look at their general
telling them to surrender,

3324
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:50,114
and they all kinda throw
their weapons to the ground,

3325
02:08:50,114 --> 02:08:52,198
and stand there with
their arms to the side,

3326
02:08:52,198 --> 02:08:55,751
kind of waiting for
what's gonna happen next.

3327
02:08:55,751 --> 02:09:00,250
As you finish that,
Clarota slowly drifts down.

3328
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:02,234
SAM: Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks
for all the fucking help.

3329
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:04,484
(all laugh)

3330
02:09:06,010 --> 02:09:06,843
LAURA: Oh no.

3331
02:09:06,843 --> 02:09:08,593
This is gonna be bad.

3332
02:09:10,513 --> 02:09:12,256
MATT: Clarota just kinda looks around.

3333
02:09:12,256 --> 02:09:15,366
Says, you hear this voice in your mind go,

3334
02:09:15,366 --> 02:09:18,199
"I had my doubts, but, well done."

3335
02:09:21,077 --> 02:09:22,684
ORION: Thank you.

3336
02:09:22,684 --> 02:09:23,970
MATT: So.

3337
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:25,857
That ends that turn.

3338
02:09:25,857 --> 02:09:27,994
Scanlan, do you want to move at all?

3339
02:09:27,994 --> 02:09:29,924
Are you going to stay where you are?

3340
02:09:29,924 --> 02:09:31,370
SAM: I'm gonna stay where, well,

3341
02:09:31,370 --> 02:09:32,605
I'm gonna move just a couple feet

3342
02:09:32,605 --> 02:09:33,871
away from the guy right behind me,

3343
02:09:33,871 --> 02:09:36,720
and I'm going to, as my bonus action,

3344
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:39,841
might as well give Grog some dice.

3345
02:09:39,841 --> 02:09:41,077
And also just tell everyone,

3346
02:09:41,077 --> 02:09:42,629
remember, let's not kill the general,

3347
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:44,217
we need him for information.

3348
02:09:44,217 --> 02:09:45,578
LIAM: Probably if anyone tries to hit him,

3349
02:09:45,578 --> 02:09:47,661
he'll snap out of it, so.

3350
02:09:50,351 --> 02:09:51,351
SAM: That's it.

3351
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:56,660
I also take a little poo in my pants.

3352
02:09:57,524 --> 02:09:58,607
TALIESIN: Small kilo.

3353
02:10:02,022 --> 02:10:04,174
SAM: This is still--

3354
02:10:04,174 --> 02:10:06,279
A battle? Even though.

3355
02:10:06,279 --> 02:10:07,112
No combatants?

3356
02:10:07,112 --> 02:10:09,378
MATT: I mean, if you guys are deciding
not to fight anymore,

3357
02:10:09,378 --> 02:10:11,383
what's your plan?

3358
02:10:11,383 --> 02:10:12,216
MARISHA: I--

3359
02:10:13,281 --> 02:10:17,097
Come on down and I say, good work guys.

3360
02:10:17,097 --> 02:10:20,142
That was cool, that was great.

3361
02:10:20,142 --> 02:10:21,759
SAM: He's under my spell.

3362
02:10:21,759 --> 02:10:22,988
LAURA: Perhaps we should tie him up.

3363
02:10:22,988 --> 02:10:24,363
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna say,

3364
02:10:24,363 --> 02:10:28,759
I cast Grasping Vine
and I just take a vine

3365
02:10:28,759 --> 02:10:32,180
and I tie his hands behind his back.

3366
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:33,972
And kind of grapple him.

3367
02:10:33,972 --> 02:10:35,194
SAM: So that'll break the spell.

3368
02:10:35,194 --> 02:10:37,904
MARISHA: Well no, I'm not damaging him, I'm just--

3369
02:10:37,904 --> 02:10:38,805
LIAM: Hugging him.

3370
02:10:38,805 --> 02:10:39,638
MARISHA: Yeah.

3371
02:10:39,638 --> 02:10:41,013
LAURA: Hugging him with vines.

3372
02:10:41,013 --> 02:10:42,763
TALIESIN: Vine hugs.

3373
02:10:46,001 --> 02:10:50,168
MATT: As this is happening, you
guys feel a familiar tremble.

3374
02:10:51,064 --> 02:10:51,897
SAM: Oh no.

3375
02:10:53,243 --> 02:10:54,456
Be quiet.

3376
02:10:54,456 --> 02:10:56,020
MATT: In the ground.

3377
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:58,020
LIAM: DM is out of his mind.

3378
02:10:59,703 --> 02:11:00,857
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check.

3379
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:01,690
(all laugh)

3380
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:03,231
MARISHA: Damn it.

3381
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:05,374
ORION: Oh, that's a 20.

3382
02:11:05,374 --> 02:11:06,624
SAM: That is a 20.

3383
02:11:07,509 --> 02:11:09,723
MARISHA: (whimpers)

3384
02:11:09,723 --> 02:11:12,979
This is the second time I
rolled a one on my stealth check.

3385
02:11:12,979 --> 02:11:14,455
TALIESIN: Wow.

3386
02:11:14,455 --> 02:11:15,992
MARISHA: I'm not stealthy today.

3387
02:11:15,992 --> 02:11:16,825
ASHLEY: 17.
LIAM: 18.

3388
02:11:16,825 --> 02:11:17,658
LAURA: 19.

3389
02:11:17,658 --> 02:11:18,722
TRAVIS: 14.

3390
02:11:18,722 --> 02:11:20,352
TALIESIN: 23.

3391
02:11:20,352 --> 02:11:21,337
LIAM: Pretty good overall.

3392
02:11:21,337 --> 02:11:22,241
ORION: Two.

3393
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:23,757
SAM: 22.

3394
02:11:23,757 --> 02:11:24,590
MATT: All right.

3395
02:11:30,124 --> 02:11:33,683
There is the rumble,
gets louder and louder,

3396
02:11:33,683 --> 02:11:38,509
and you can see the duergar
looking around nervously.

3397
02:11:38,509 --> 02:11:41,842
The rumbling kind of fades for a second.

3398
02:11:43,169 --> 02:11:44,912
And with a cacophonous cracking sound,

3399
02:11:44,912 --> 02:11:47,434
the stone floor beneath
you

3400
02:11:47,434 --> 02:11:48,435
splits open.

3401
02:11:48,435 --> 02:11:49,268
SAM: No!

3402
02:11:50,959 --> 02:11:51,850
MATT: Right here.

3403
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:53,005
LIAM: (groans)

3404
02:11:53,005 --> 02:11:54,197
MATT: Percy, make an acrobatics check

3405
02:11:54,197 --> 02:11:57,213
and try to avoid whatever
is coming through.

3406
02:11:57,213 --> 02:11:59,320
SAM: Whatever? It's a dragon!

3407
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:00,504
TALIESIN: 18.
LIAM: It's a worm.

3408
02:12:00,504 --> 02:12:02,559
MATT: All right, you manage to
just pull out of the way.

3409
02:12:02,559 --> 02:12:04,097
As a large--

3410
02:12:04,097 --> 02:12:06,118
LAURA: What the fuck is that?

3411
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:07,253
MARISHA: : What is that?

3412
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:09,890
MATT: A large armored four-legged creature

3413
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:12,764
comes bursting out of
the ground around you.

3414
02:12:12,764 --> 02:12:14,679
ORION: Oh great, it's a rock butthole.

3415
02:12:14,679 --> 02:12:17,230
(all laugh)

3416
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:21,448
MATT: Lets out this horrible
screeching growl,

3417
02:12:21,448 --> 02:12:23,832
has this kind of hungry look in its eyes.

3418
02:12:23,832 --> 02:12:25,624
MARISHA: Can I reactionary real quick,

3419
02:12:25,624 --> 02:12:28,921
take my Grasping Vine and just lift him

3420
02:12:28,921 --> 02:12:30,009
and kind of put him in the corner

3421
02:12:30,009 --> 02:12:32,116
to keep the general safe?

3422
02:12:32,116 --> 02:12:34,365
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

3423
02:12:34,365 --> 02:12:35,721
ORION: Is he rooted?

3424
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:37,451
MATT: He is currently--

3425
02:12:37,451 --> 02:12:39,689
Is considered grappled.

3426
02:12:39,689 --> 02:12:41,539
LIAM: I have a question.

3427
02:12:41,539 --> 02:12:42,839
MARISHA: I was just trying to keep him safe.

3428
02:12:42,839 --> 02:12:43,971
LIAM: Can we take a potty break before?

3429
02:12:43,971 --> 02:12:44,861
SAM: A potty break?

3430
02:12:44,861 --> 02:12:45,943
No breaks tonight!

3431
02:12:45,943 --> 02:12:46,776
LIAM: No breaks?

3432
02:12:46,776 --> 02:12:47,776
MARISHA: No breaks.

3433
02:12:48,753 --> 02:12:50,726
MATT: We're pushing through.

3434
02:12:50,726 --> 02:12:51,559
You need a bottle.

3435
02:12:51,559 --> 02:12:53,476
MARISHA: Exercise your kegels.

3436
02:12:55,059 --> 02:12:56,481
MATT: If you really need to go, you can.

3437
02:12:56,481 --> 02:12:58,116
When it's not your turn.

3438
02:12:58,116 --> 02:12:58,979
LIAM: No, I'm fine.

3439
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:01,859
SAM: Just pee on Ashley, it's okay.

3440
02:13:01,859 --> 02:13:04,776
CREW: Suck it up, man.

3441
02:13:04,776 --> 02:13:06,372
MATT: As this entity comes burrowing up

3442
02:13:06,372 --> 02:13:08,789
from underneath the ground,

3443
02:13:10,668 --> 02:13:13,413
it immediately makes a

3444
02:13:13,413 --> 02:13:14,830
strike against--

3445
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:22,804
SAM: Guys, this is so exciting.

3446
02:13:22,804 --> 02:13:24,646
And Laura has no idea what's going on.

3447
02:13:24,646 --> 02:13:26,887
LAURA: No clue, good times.

3448
02:13:26,887 --> 02:13:29,027
MATT: This is gonna be a bite
attack against you, Percy.

3449
02:13:29,027 --> 02:13:32,701
That is, all right, 24 versus armor class.

3450
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:34,284
TRAVIS: Shit, bite is at 24.

3451
02:13:35,185 --> 02:13:36,106
TALIESIN: Yeah, that--

3452
02:13:36,106 --> 02:13:36,939
That hits.

3453
02:13:37,904 --> 02:13:40,938
MATT: As you reactively attempt
to move out of the way,

3454
02:13:40,938 --> 02:13:43,452
this creature comes
tearing out of the ground.

3455
02:13:43,452 --> 02:13:46,013
Gets its bearings, rears back,

3456
02:13:46,013 --> 02:13:48,672
and this giant, toothy
maw comes clamping down

3457
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:50,783
onto your entire torso.

3458
02:13:50,783 --> 02:13:52,521
You suffer 36 points of piercing damage.

3459
02:13:52,521 --> 02:13:53,401
SAM: Oh!

3460
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:54,832
TALIESIN: The fuck?

3461
02:13:54,832 --> 02:13:55,733
MARISHA: 36?

3462
02:13:55,733 --> 02:13:58,316
MATT: 36 points of piercing damage.

3463
02:14:03,161 --> 02:14:05,578
That's going to end its turn.

3464
02:14:06,506 --> 02:14:07,509
MARISHA: Shit.

3465
02:14:07,509 --> 02:14:09,310
MATT: Pike, you're up.

3466
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,703
ASHLEY: Okay, well.

3467
02:14:10,703 --> 02:14:11,703
TALIESIN: That hurt.

3468
02:14:12,641 --> 02:14:14,098
ASHLEY: I'm still prone?

3469
02:14:14,098 --> 02:14:14,931
MATT: You are prone,

3470
02:14:14,931 --> 02:14:16,031
you can use your movement to get back up.

3471
02:14:16,031 --> 02:14:19,339
ASHLEY: Okay, I use my movement to get back up.

3472
02:14:19,339 --> 02:14:21,592
Do I also get an attack for doing that?

3473
02:14:21,592 --> 02:14:23,239
MATT: You still have your action,
and your bonus action,

3474
02:14:23,239 --> 02:14:24,104
it's just your move.

3475
02:14:24,104 --> 02:14:25,717
ASHLEY: Okay.

3476
02:14:25,717 --> 02:14:29,884
I will use Guiding Bolt, and
I'm gonna shoot that thing.

3477
02:14:31,142 --> 02:14:35,090
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.

3478
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:36,580
SAM: That's my girlfriend.
TRAVIS: Come on, Pike.

3479
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:37,630
MARISHA: Does this guy appear to be messed up

3480
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:39,425
by the Daylight at all?

3481
02:14:39,425 --> 02:14:40,766
ASHLEY: Okay.

3482
02:14:40,766 --> 02:14:42,006
Do I add anything?

3483
02:14:42,006 --> 02:14:44,123
MATT: You add your spell attack modifier,

3484
02:14:44,123 --> 02:14:46,388
it's on your spell sheet.

3485
02:14:46,388 --> 02:14:47,813
So the top of your spell sheet.

3486
02:14:47,813 --> 02:14:49,472
ASHLEY: Sorry guys.

3487
02:14:49,472 --> 02:14:51,055
Oh sweet, okay, so.

3488
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:55,716
That would be 25.

3489
02:14:55,716 --> 02:14:57,023
MATT: That definitely hits.

3490
02:14:57,023 --> 02:14:59,119
So, Guiding Bolt, what does that do?

3491
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:02,286
ASHLEY: So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6.

3492
02:15:04,231 --> 02:15:05,079
I roll 4d6.

3493
02:15:05,079 --> 02:15:07,329
MATT: 4d6, go ahead and do that.

3494
02:15:10,807 --> 02:15:11,640
ASHLEY: Yes.

3495
02:15:14,691 --> 02:15:15,957
16.

3496
02:15:15,957 --> 02:15:17,860
MATT: 16, all right.

3497
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:21,488
So you reach back,
clutching your holy symbol.

3498
02:15:21,488 --> 02:15:22,882
You get back off the ground,

3499
02:15:22,882 --> 02:15:25,756
release your hand as this
suddenly flaring blast

3500
02:15:25,756 --> 02:15:27,453
of divine energy comes cascading

3501
02:15:27,453 --> 02:15:28,806
out of the front of your palm,

3502
02:15:28,806 --> 02:15:30,300
blasting into the side of the face,

3503
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:32,426
nearly searing one of
the eyes of the creature.

3504
02:15:32,426 --> 02:15:34,687
It rears back, brings
one leg up instinctually,

3505
02:15:34,687 --> 02:15:37,542
(growls) slams the ground in the process--

3506
02:15:37,542 --> 02:15:38,674
How you doing?

3507
02:15:38,674 --> 02:15:40,240
That's disadvantage to your next attack.

3508
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,073
LIAM: Aw!

3509
02:15:44,052 --> 02:15:46,402
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you at?

3510
02:15:46,402 --> 02:15:47,402
TALIESIN: I'm at 38.

3511
02:15:49,835 --> 02:15:51,508
MATT: It lands, puts its foot
back on the ground,

3512
02:15:51,508 --> 02:15:54,113
and kinda gears its attention towards you.

3513
02:15:54,113 --> 02:15:55,128
It's angling around the room

3514
02:15:55,128 --> 02:15:57,940
for what should be its next meal.

3515
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,837
Anything else you wanna do?

3516
02:15:59,837 --> 02:16:02,479
ASHLEY: Can I give him a healing potion?

3517
02:16:02,479 --> 02:16:03,675
Can I heal him?

3518
02:16:03,675 --> 02:16:04,654
MATT: He's too far away.

3519
02:16:04,654 --> 02:16:05,487
You could use your bonus action

3520
02:16:05,487 --> 02:16:06,571
if you wanna use Healing Word.

3521
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:07,512
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll use Healing Word.

3522
02:16:07,512 --> 02:16:09,654
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll that for him.

3523
02:16:09,654 --> 02:16:13,260
While you're doing that, brings us--

3524
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,463
So Clarota now gets its action.

3525
02:16:16,463 --> 02:16:17,924
MARISHA: Yeah, Clarota!

3526
02:16:17,924 --> 02:16:20,457
MATT: Clarota now looks wide-eyed, seeing this happen.

3527
02:16:20,457 --> 02:16:23,957
You hear a slight voice in
the back of your head go,

3528
02:16:23,957 --> 02:16:25,943
"This is complicating."

3529
02:16:25,943 --> 02:16:27,357
As it rears back,

3530
02:16:27,357 --> 02:16:29,795
you hear the slight
echoing, screeching sound,

3531
02:16:29,795 --> 02:16:32,647
that just manages to skirt the outside

3532
02:16:32,647 --> 02:16:34,202
of your mental capacity.

3533
02:16:34,202 --> 02:16:35,459
You feel like if you were any closer,

3534
02:16:35,459 --> 02:16:36,584
or if it was directed towards you,

3535
02:16:36,584 --> 02:16:38,575
it would be a horrible
ringing pain in your head.

3536
02:16:38,575 --> 02:16:40,329
You're just peripheral to it.

3537
02:16:40,329 --> 02:16:42,475
It makes its attack.

3538
02:16:42,475 --> 02:16:44,601
Unfortunately, the exterior, the bulette,

3539
02:16:44,601 --> 02:16:46,173
and/or its mind shielding is too strong,

3540
02:16:46,173 --> 02:16:48,114
it seems to have no
effect on the creature.

3541
02:16:48,114 --> 02:16:49,162
SAM: Damn it!

3542
02:16:49,162 --> 02:16:51,170
Clarota, worthless!

3543
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:53,503
MATT: A bulette, is the entity.

3544
02:16:56,061 --> 02:16:58,947
That ends its turn,
top of the round, Vax.

3545
02:16:58,947 --> 02:17:01,530
LIAM: Okay, I think, where's the laser?

3546
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:03,905
Here it is.

3547
02:17:03,905 --> 02:17:06,250
It looks like I have
just enough squares to go

3548
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:07,416
one two three.

3549
02:17:10,032 --> 02:17:10,912
Who's this right here?

3550
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:12,208
MATT: That's a duergar.

3551
02:17:12,208 --> 02:17:13,772
Weapon on the ground, not armed right now.

3552
02:17:13,772 --> 02:17:15,652
LIAM: Can I get to here on a turn?

3553
02:17:15,652 --> 02:17:17,077
I can't tell.

3554
02:17:17,077 --> 02:17:18,243
MATT: What's your movement?

3555
02:17:18,243 --> 02:17:20,075
LIAM: It's 30 feet.

3556
02:17:21,708 --> 02:17:24,614
I'll use my bonus action to
click my haste boots together.

3557
02:17:24,614 --> 02:17:27,331
MATT: Okay, then you can definitely do that.

3558
02:17:27,331 --> 02:17:30,191
LIAM: Okay, and since Percy
is right up against it,

3559
02:17:30,191 --> 02:17:32,911
I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage,

3560
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:34,869
because there's another one of its foes.

3561
02:17:34,869 --> 02:17:36,054
MATT: Exactly, yes.

3562
02:17:36,054 --> 02:17:37,272
You don't get an advantage on the attack,

3563
02:17:37,272 --> 02:17:38,834
but if you attack, you do it.

3564
02:17:38,834 --> 02:17:41,824
LIAM: So I'm gonna try to strike
him in his underbelly.

3565
02:17:41,824 --> 02:17:42,656
MATT: All right.

3566
02:17:43,618 --> 02:17:45,749
Even the underbelly
itself is heavily armored,

3567
02:17:45,749 --> 02:17:47,585
you have to kind of gauge
quickly where the plate is.

3568
02:17:47,585 --> 02:17:48,466
LIAM: 20.

3569
02:17:48,466 --> 02:17:49,321
MATT: 20?

3570
02:17:49,321 --> 02:17:50,443
20 hits.

3571
02:17:50,443 --> 02:17:52,543
MATT: Go ahead and roll with
your Sneak Attack damage.

3572
02:17:52,543 --> 02:17:53,555
MARISHA: So 20 hits?

3573
02:17:53,555 --> 02:17:55,138
LIAM: Oh, and it was--

3574
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:57,121
Never mind.

3575
02:17:57,121 --> 02:17:57,955
So three.

3576
02:18:04,105 --> 02:18:05,105
There we go.

3577
02:18:11,066 --> 02:18:11,898
22.

3578
02:18:13,726 --> 02:18:15,318
MATT: 22 damage?

3579
02:18:15,318 --> 02:18:16,152
All righty.

3580
02:18:17,563 --> 02:18:18,396
Got it.

3581
02:18:19,504 --> 02:18:21,671
Cool, that brings us to--

3582
02:18:24,147 --> 02:18:26,858
The general is going to
attempt to make a saving throw.

3583
02:18:26,858 --> 02:18:27,950
SAM: Shit.

3584
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:29,045
He can do that?

3585
02:18:29,045 --> 02:18:29,878
MATT: Every time he gets a turn round,

3586
02:18:29,878 --> 02:18:33,127
he gets a chance to break out of the--

3587
02:18:33,127 --> 02:18:34,320
And he does.

3588
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:35,638
SAM: Oh, he broke out?

3589
02:18:35,638 --> 02:18:36,481
LAURA: (gasps)

3590
02:18:36,481 --> 02:18:39,565
MATT: Shrugs off the mental influence
of the Dominate spell.

3591
02:18:39,565 --> 02:18:42,139
However, he is not currently armed.

3592
02:18:42,139 --> 02:18:43,307
He uses his

3593
02:18:45,535 --> 02:18:49,272
movement, or action to
pick up the war hammer.

3594
02:18:49,272 --> 02:18:50,941
Fury and anger is in his eyes.

3595
02:18:50,941 --> 02:18:52,101
MARISHA: He's still grappled.

3596
02:18:52,101 --> 02:18:53,678
SAM: No no, he just broke out, right?

3597
02:18:53,678 --> 02:18:55,068
MARISHA: Oh, from the grapple, too?

3598
02:18:55,068 --> 02:18:56,752
MATT: Yeah, he used his whole turn
to break out of the grapple

3599
02:18:56,752 --> 02:18:58,147
and grab its weapon, that's all he can do.

3600
02:18:58,147 --> 02:18:59,273
SAM: Where is he?

3601
02:18:59,273 --> 02:19:00,477
MATT: Right there.

3602
02:19:00,477 --> 02:19:01,749
LIAM: To fight the bulette?

3603
02:19:01,749 --> 02:19:02,582
Or to--

3604
02:19:02,582 --> 02:19:03,592
MATT: You have no idea.

3605
02:19:03,592 --> 02:19:04,919
LIAM: Oh, we don't know, oh.

3606
02:19:04,919 --> 02:19:07,427
He could just be reacting to the bulette.

3607
02:19:07,427 --> 02:19:08,894
MATT: The flames on the hammer are out too.

3608
02:19:08,894 --> 02:19:09,924
But it picks up the war hammer,

3609
02:19:09,924 --> 02:19:11,304
it's cold black steel currently.

3610
02:19:11,304 --> 02:19:12,137
TRAVIS: We got our Davy Jones in the room,

3611
02:19:12,137 --> 02:19:13,623
he'll take care of the dwarves.

3612
02:19:13,623 --> 02:19:15,456
MATT: That brings us to...

3613
02:19:16,806 --> 02:19:17,638
Grog.

3614
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:19,812
TRAVIS: (groans)

3615
02:19:19,812 --> 02:19:20,912
Kitty!

3616
02:19:20,912 --> 02:19:23,939
I would like to go into a frenzied rage,

3617
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:26,743
and charge at Clifford the big red dog.

3618
02:19:26,743 --> 02:19:28,525
(all alguH)

3619
02:19:28,525 --> 02:19:29,943
MATT: You leap off the higher platofrm,

3620
02:19:29,943 --> 02:19:31,387
come rushing out with your ax in the air,

3621
02:19:31,387 --> 02:19:33,737
as you come down using the
full weight of your body

3622
02:19:33,737 --> 02:19:37,282
behind the attack, go ahead
and roll your three attacks.

3623
02:19:37,282 --> 02:19:40,147
TRAVIS: All right, I have nine, eight, 17.

3624
02:19:40,147 --> 02:19:42,025
SAM: You have one dice from me.

3625
02:19:42,025 --> 02:19:43,386
I've inspired you.

3626
02:19:43,386 --> 02:19:44,825
TRAVIS: Oh.

3627
02:19:44,825 --> 02:19:45,995
SAM: (singing) Grog. Grog.

3628
02:19:45,995 --> 02:19:47,505
TRAVIS: Is it a 20 or is it a what?

3629
02:19:47,505 --> 02:19:49,501
MATT: You get to add a d8 to an attack roll.

3630
02:19:49,501 --> 02:19:51,023
SAM: If you have a shitty attack roll,

3631
02:19:51,023 --> 02:19:53,383
add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll.

3632
02:19:53,383 --> 02:19:54,216
TRAVIS: 17.

3633
02:19:54,216 --> 02:19:56,293
ORION: Grog, smash right
through his plate thingy.

3634
02:19:56,293 --> 02:19:58,129
MATT: Barely hits.

3635
02:19:58,129 --> 02:19:58,962
TRAVIS: 19.

3636
02:19:58,962 --> 02:20:00,133
MATT: Hits, all three attacks hit.

3637
02:20:00,133 --> 02:20:02,827
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight.

3638
02:20:02,827 --> 02:20:04,954
MATT: So all three attacks hit,
roll damage for three hits.

3639
02:20:04,954 --> 02:20:07,422
As you come now, just
slamming your grey ax,

3640
02:20:07,422 --> 02:20:08,900
into the side of this armored beast,

3641
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:10,282
just over and over again.

3642
02:20:10,282 --> 02:20:12,268
Cleaving this nice little wide section

3643
02:20:12,268 --> 02:20:13,403
of its armor on the side.

3644
02:20:13,403 --> 02:20:15,736
LIAM: Take his fucking head off.

3645
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:19,366
TRAVIS: 14.

3646
02:20:19,366 --> 02:20:20,199
21.

3647
02:20:24,391 --> 02:20:25,224
21 again.

3648
02:20:26,927 --> 02:20:27,760
ASHLEY: What?

3649
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:28,593
TRAVIS: 22.

3650
02:20:29,727 --> 02:20:30,832
LAURA: Oh, so.

3651
02:20:30,832 --> 02:20:32,439
22, 21, and 14.

3652
02:20:32,439 --> 02:20:33,272
SAM: Whoa.

3653
02:20:34,221 --> 02:20:35,309
LAURA: I was doing his math.

3654
02:20:35,309 --> 02:20:36,496
(all laugh)

3655
02:20:36,496 --> 02:20:38,351
MATT: 21, 22, and 14 you said?

3656
02:20:38,351 --> 02:20:39,184
ASHLEY: 57?

3657
02:20:39,184 --> 02:20:40,298
SAM: 57.

3658
02:20:40,298 --> 02:20:43,326
TRAVIS: I don't wanna do math and show you all up.

3659
02:20:43,326 --> 02:20:45,810
LIAM: That's a level nine barbarian.

3660
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:50,265
MATT: So, slam him, you see a portion
of its side armor splits,

3661
02:20:50,265 --> 02:20:54,461
you can see a little bit of
that dark red, fleshy interior.

3662
02:20:54,461 --> 02:20:55,897
You do a significant amount of damage,

3663
02:20:55,897 --> 02:20:57,843
and leave a nice little
weak point in its armor.

3664
02:20:57,843 --> 02:20:59,180
However, it still doesn't seem

3665
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,986
to be entirely phased by the damage,

3666
02:21:00,986 --> 02:21:02,650
it just kinda shrugs at the damage,

3667
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:03,903
and kinda glares at you for a second.

3668
02:21:03,903 --> 02:21:06,317
One of its eyes that was focused
on Percy and Keyleth,

3669
02:21:06,317 --> 02:21:10,096
now looks over
at you Jurassic-Park style,

3670
02:21:10,096 --> 02:21:13,875
with the t-rex up at
the side of the vehicle.

3671
02:21:13,875 --> 02:21:15,132
Vex?

3672
02:21:15,132 --> 02:21:17,714
LAURA: I back up a little bit.

3673
02:21:17,714 --> 02:21:18,816
Yeah, like that.

3674
02:21:18,816 --> 02:21:22,233
And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him.

3675
02:21:23,283 --> 02:21:24,563
MATT: Okay.

3676
02:21:24,563 --> 02:21:25,521
SAM: Sounds nasty.

3677
02:21:25,521 --> 02:21:26,354
LAURA: Right?

3678
02:21:28,037 --> 02:21:30,012
I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack.

3679
02:21:30,012 --> 02:21:31,378
MATT: So your bonus action to cast
Hail of Thorns,

3680
02:21:31,378 --> 02:21:33,671
and then you attack
with the arrow, go for it.

3681
02:21:33,671 --> 02:21:34,504
LAURA: Yes.

3682
02:21:36,616 --> 02:21:37,683
MATT: You're adding 11 to it.

3683
02:21:37,683 --> 02:21:40,510
LAURA: Okay, good, then that'd be

3684
02:21:40,510 --> 02:21:41,805
18.

3685
02:21:41,805 --> 02:21:42,829
MATT: 18? 18 hits.

3686
02:21:42,829 --> 02:21:47,535
LAURA: Yes, so I was casting that
as a level three spell.

3687
02:21:47,535 --> 02:21:50,452
I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10.

3688
02:21:52,233 --> 02:21:54,014
MATT: Against the creature?

3689
02:21:54,014 --> 02:21:56,264
LAURA: Against 14 which is my

3690
02:21:57,409 --> 02:21:58,992
spell level thingy.

3691
02:22:01,041 --> 02:22:02,632
TRAVIS: 3d10.

3692
02:22:02,632 --> 02:22:04,123
LAURA: Yeah, 1d10 for damage.

3693
02:22:04,123 --> 02:22:05,540
MATT: Yep, go for it.

3694
02:22:08,941 --> 02:22:10,463
LAURA: That is an eight-sided dice, yay!

3695
02:22:10,463 --> 02:22:11,630
MATT: There yougo.

3696
02:22:16,102 --> 02:22:17,600
LAURA: An eight.

3697
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,850
MATT: That'd be 25.

3698
02:22:20,612 --> 02:22:24,362
LAURA: I get another attack,
so I'm gonna do that.

3699
02:22:26,138 --> 02:22:27,383
Natural 20!
(all cheer)

3700
02:22:27,383 --> 02:22:29,441
MATT: Nice, all right, go ahead and roll damage,

3701
02:22:29,441 --> 02:22:31,872
double the dice and add
your modifier of seven.

3702
02:22:31,872 --> 02:22:33,804
LIAM: That arrow just went slow mo.

3703
02:22:33,804 --> 02:22:35,304
LAURA: Double the dice.

3704
02:22:36,417 --> 02:22:37,250
15.

3705
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:38,083
MATT: 15, all right.

3706
02:22:38,083 --> 02:22:40,729
So what happens here is
you pull an arrow out,

3707
02:22:40,729 --> 02:22:42,292
as you whisper a couple of
words under your breath,

3708
02:22:42,292 --> 02:22:44,349
you see all these thorny
spikes being to shoot out

3709
02:22:44,349 --> 02:22:45,493
the shaft of the arrow.

3710
02:22:45,493 --> 02:22:47,874
You release it and as it strikes
in the front of its face,

3711
02:22:47,874 --> 02:22:49,194
the arrow actually splinters,

3712
02:22:49,194 --> 02:22:51,500
sending a bunch of these
thorns all over its torso,

3713
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,098
piercing an inch or two into its armor

3714
02:22:53,098 --> 02:22:54,943
with each blast of these thorns.

3715
02:22:54,943 --> 02:22:57,077
It kinda rears back and
tries to shake itself off.

3716
02:22:57,077 --> 02:22:59,185
As it does, you get a little bit of a look

3717
02:22:59,185 --> 02:23:00,426
as Grog backs away from it,

3718
02:23:00,426 --> 02:23:01,704
checking to see the wound he left.

3719
02:23:01,704 --> 02:23:04,428
You take your secondary arrow,
aim for the red soft spot,

3720
02:23:04,428 --> 02:23:05,963
boom, slips right past the armor plating,

3721
02:23:05,963 --> 02:23:07,546
doing the extra damage on the interior

3722
02:23:07,546 --> 02:23:09,060
of its physical self.

3723
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:11,337
Awesome, that's your turn I believe.

3724
02:23:11,337 --> 02:23:12,170
ASHLEY: Good turn.

3725
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:13,066
MATT: Percy, you're up.

3726
02:23:13,066 --> 02:23:15,782
TALIESIN: Okay, is my hand still stuck in its 
mouth?

3727
02:23:15,782 --> 02:23:18,239
(all laugh)

3728
02:23:18,239 --> 02:23:19,580
TALIESIN: I would like it to be.

3729
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:22,582
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah,
you could've left it there.

3730
02:23:22,582 --> 02:23:24,467
TALIESIN: Do I have an advantage to hit

3731
02:23:24,467 --> 02:23:26,213
if my gun is in its mouth?

3732
02:23:26,213 --> 02:23:27,593
(all laugh)

3733
02:23:27,593 --> 02:23:30,673
MATT: You are considered grappled
if you leave your hand there.

3734
02:23:30,673 --> 02:23:33,029
You can remain grappled for
advantage on the attack roll.

3735
02:23:33,029 --> 02:23:33,862
TALIESIN: Done.

3736
02:23:35,831 --> 02:23:36,863
So I get to roll twice?

3737
02:23:36,863 --> 02:23:37,982
MATT: You do.

3738
02:23:37,982 --> 02:23:41,732
MARISHA: This is a whole new
meaning to point-blank.

3739
02:23:44,309 --> 02:23:45,320
TALIESIN: 19.

3740
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:46,863
MATT: 19, that'll hit.

3741
02:23:46,863 --> 02:23:49,022
TALIESIN: Okay, I spent some grit on this,

3742
02:23:49,022 --> 02:23:51,302
and did some interesting modifiers.

3743
02:23:51,302 --> 02:23:52,135
MATT: How much grit did you spend?

3744
02:23:52,135 --> 02:23:52,968
TALIESIN: Two points of grit.

3745
02:23:52,968 --> 02:23:54,801
MATT: Okay, this is the--

3746
02:23:56,334 --> 02:23:57,303
TALIESIN: The Deadshot.

3747
02:23:57,303 --> 02:23:59,720
And I also took a negative

3748
02:24:03,352 --> 02:24:06,487
five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot,

3749
02:24:06,487 --> 02:24:09,409
and I'm using my fire modifier.

3750
02:24:09,409 --> 02:24:10,739
I'm just being an asshole.

3751
02:24:10,739 --> 02:24:13,655
(all laugh)

3752
02:24:13,655 --> 02:24:15,072
MARISHA: That's amazing.

3753
02:24:17,422 --> 02:24:18,339
TALIESIN: That's...

3754
02:24:19,395 --> 02:24:22,194
16 and 20, 35 points of fire damage

3755
02:24:22,194 --> 02:24:24,423
inside of its mouth.

3756
02:24:24,423 --> 02:24:27,363
MATT: So, your hand inside,
you pull back and fire,

3757
02:24:27,363 --> 02:24:28,991
knowing which barrel is next.

3758
02:24:28,991 --> 02:24:31,847
You hear this dull(muffled explosion) sound,

3759
02:24:31,847 --> 02:24:34,055
and its eyes kinda pulse for a second,

3760
02:24:34,055 --> 02:24:35,987
in intense fury and pain,

3761
02:24:35,987 --> 02:24:38,333
smoke just billows out
the sides of its mouth,

3762
02:24:38,333 --> 02:24:41,352
and its nostrils, and it begins
to kind of shake its head,

3763
02:24:41,352 --> 02:24:43,200
lifting you about a foot off the ground,

3764
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,602
painfully, but you think
it's worth the deal.

3765
02:24:45,602 --> 02:24:46,714
Well done.

3766
02:24:46,714 --> 02:24:47,827
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3767
02:24:47,827 --> 02:24:48,660
LIAM: Aw man.

3768
02:24:50,187 --> 02:24:51,400
MATT: I will say that ends your turn.

3769
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,429
LIAM: Thank you Gary Gygax, wherever you are.

3770
02:24:53,429 --> 02:24:55,679
(all laugh)

3771
02:24:57,869 --> 02:24:59,290
MATT: All right.

3772
02:24:59,290 --> 02:25:02,307
The duergar, currently
seeing the situation,

3773
02:25:02,307 --> 02:25:04,642
and the change of tone, go
and grab their weapons.

3774
02:25:04,642 --> 02:25:05,670
TRAVIS: Change of tone.

3775
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:07,224
(all laugh)

3776
02:25:07,224 --> 02:25:09,214
TRAVIS: Shit got real.

3777
02:25:10,631 --> 02:25:12,374
MATT: This duergar is going to move up,

3778
02:25:12,374 --> 02:25:14,840
back to you, Scanlan, as it sees

3779
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,581
that you were the one that
took over the general.

3780
02:25:16,581 --> 02:25:17,414
SAM: Dicks, bring it.

3781
02:25:17,414 --> 02:25:18,247
LIAM: Dicks.

3782
02:25:18,247 --> 02:25:19,178
MATT: This one comes rushing in.

3783
02:25:19,178 --> 02:25:20,648
MARISHA: Aw, come on.

3784
02:25:20,648 --> 02:25:21,789
LIAM: Freakin' tank in the room.

3785
02:25:21,789 --> 02:25:24,264
MARISHA: There's a bigger problem, bro.

3786
02:25:24,264 --> 02:25:26,231
MATT: Opportunists, man.

3787
02:25:26,231 --> 02:25:28,581
It rushes after you, actually.

3788
02:25:28,581 --> 02:25:30,524
LIAM: ♫ Why can't we be friends

3789
02:25:30,524 --> 02:25:32,882
ALL: ♫ Why can't we be friends

3790
02:25:32,882 --> 02:25:34,496
MATT: All right, the attack against you, Scanlan.

3791
02:25:34,496 --> 02:25:37,126
That is gonna be a 17 versus AC.

3792
02:25:37,126 --> 02:25:39,758
All right, this one is actually
also physically growing

3793
02:25:39,758 --> 02:25:41,530
in size as it comes towards you.

3794
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:42,511
SAM: It's getting hard.

3795
02:25:42,511 --> 02:25:44,808
(all laugh)

3796
02:25:44,808 --> 02:25:46,058
MATT: You suffer

3797
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:50,184
16 points of damage.

3798
02:25:50,184 --> 02:25:51,017
ORION: Such a bummer.

3799
02:25:51,017 --> 02:25:52,975
MATT: As the war pick comes
slamming into your side.

3800
02:25:52,975 --> 02:25:55,046
You see it's coming, but
you're just not fast enough.

3801
02:25:55,046 --> 02:25:57,034
It hits you, on impact,
it may have cracked a rib,

3802
02:25:57,034 --> 02:25:58,319
you're not sure.

3803
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:00,842
The one that's coming
up against you, rolls,

3804
02:26:00,842 --> 02:26:03,577
that's going to be a
17 versus armor class.

3805
02:26:03,577 --> 02:26:04,494
LIAM: Fuck you.

3806
02:26:05,395 --> 02:26:06,642
MATT: You see it and just duck out of the way,

3807
02:26:06,642 --> 02:26:09,399
its war pick slams into
the stone wall next to you,

3808
02:26:09,399 --> 02:26:11,633
with a horrible screeching stone sound.

3809
02:26:13,078 --> 02:26:14,411
High-AC rogue, yo.

3810
02:26:15,283 --> 02:26:17,479
All right that ends their
turn, Tiberius, you're up.

3811
02:26:17,479 --> 02:26:22,025
ORION: I'm looking in, I'm
like, oh, that's no good.

3812
02:26:22,025 --> 02:26:25,992
I look at where he made
the crack in the armor,

3813
02:26:25,992 --> 02:26:27,359
where is that, is that in the head?

3814
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:28,961
MATT: It's in the head area, right over here.

3815
02:26:28,961 --> 02:26:29,982
ORION: Right, awesome.

3816
02:26:29,982 --> 02:26:34,559
I'm going to kind of motion
towards the mind flayer,

3817
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:37,183
and give a telepathic wink.

3818
02:26:37,183 --> 02:26:38,354
MATT: It is on the ground.

3819
02:26:38,354 --> 02:26:39,187
ORION: Yeah.

3820
02:26:40,378 --> 02:26:41,521
SAM: Are you flirting with it?

3821
02:26:41,521 --> 02:26:43,029
MATT: You make a telepathic wink.

3822
02:26:43,029 --> 02:26:46,459
ORION: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis,

3823
02:26:46,459 --> 02:26:49,577
and I'm going to pry open the metal.

3824
02:26:49,577 --> 02:26:51,037
I'm not going to target the creature,

3825
02:26:51,037 --> 02:26:53,111
I'm going to target the armor.

3826
02:26:53,111 --> 02:26:53,944
TRAVIS: Nice.

3827
02:26:54,922 --> 02:26:55,898
MATT: Interesting thought, okay.

3828
02:26:55,898 --> 02:26:58,717
See if it-- the 17 is the DC?

3829
02:26:58,717 --> 02:26:59,550
ORION: Yes.

3830
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:00,584
TRAVIS: This could be cool.

3831
02:27:00,584 --> 02:27:02,392
MATT: All right, it fails.

3832
02:27:04,293 --> 02:27:05,781
So here's what happens.

3833
02:27:05,781 --> 02:27:07,698
For the effect of this.

3834
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:10,434
It suffers, I'm gonna say it suffers

3835
02:27:10,434 --> 02:27:14,228
about 2d6 points of
damage from the tearing.

3836
02:27:14,228 --> 02:27:15,876
So go ahead and roll that.

3837
02:27:15,876 --> 02:27:16,709
ORION: Six damage.

3838
02:27:16,709 --> 02:27:18,141
MATT: So six damage, however,

3839
02:27:18,141 --> 02:27:20,526
you have effectively reduced
its armor class by five.

3840
02:27:20,526 --> 02:27:21,359
TRAVIS: Yes!

3841
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,192
MATT: In doing so.

3842
02:27:22,192 --> 02:27:23,025
SAM: Ooh!

3843
02:27:24,299 --> 02:27:29,004
ORION: And I'm going to spend
two more sorcery points,

3844
02:27:29,004 --> 02:27:30,653
and do the spell again.

3845
02:27:30,653 --> 02:27:32,320
I'm going to do a--

3846
02:27:36,949 --> 02:27:39,815
I'm gonna do Firebolt, right in the hole.

3847
02:27:39,815 --> 02:27:41,680
And I'm going to use my metamagic wand

3848
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:42,978
to fire the spell.

3849
02:27:42,978 --> 02:27:44,285
MARISHA: Fire in the hole!

3850
02:27:44,285 --> 02:27:46,035
MATT: All right, go for it!

3851
02:27:47,630 --> 02:27:50,630
SAM: He has so many dice, it's crazy.

3852
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:53,412
ORION: Oh, that hits.

3853
02:27:54,405 --> 02:27:57,215
TALIESIN: Actually, does that
crit? Does your 19 crit?

3854
02:27:57,215 --> 02:27:58,650
MATT: No.

3855
02:27:58,650 --> 02:28:01,733
Usually, 20 is only crit, except for,

3856
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:04,211
I think he has a bonus ability.

3857
02:28:04,211 --> 02:28:06,661
SAM: Critical Role by the
way, name of the show.

3858
02:28:06,661 --> 02:28:09,622
(all laugh)

3859
02:28:09,622 --> 02:28:12,475
MATT: It's okay, you're good,
and you're a fighter,

3860
02:28:12,475 --> 02:28:13,531
which means eventually you'll end up

3861
02:28:13,531 --> 02:28:16,766
with four attacks per round anyway, so 
you're fine.

3862
02:28:16,766 --> 02:28:17,599
ORION: Can't do that.

3863
02:28:17,599 --> 02:28:20,021
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to it.

3864
02:28:26,358 --> 02:28:29,138
MATT: Damage, what you got?
Scanlan, you're on deck, by the way.

3865
02:28:29,138 --> 02:28:30,138
SAM: I'm ready.

3866
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:33,156
ORION: I zap him, I zap him for one.

3867
02:28:33,156 --> 02:28:33,989
MATT: Okay.

3868
02:28:33,989 --> 02:28:36,174
(all laugh)

3869
02:28:36,174 --> 02:28:37,942
ORION: No, no no no, I empowered it.

3870
02:28:37,942 --> 02:28:39,822
Full, it takes ten damage.

3871
02:28:39,822 --> 02:28:41,872
'Cause I empowered the spell.

3872
02:28:41,872 --> 02:28:43,521
MATT: That's correct, so.

3873
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:44,739
As you pull down with the ray,

3874
02:28:44,739 --> 02:28:47,981
it streaks down across the
ceiling portion of the building,

3875
02:28:47,981 --> 02:28:50,565
right into the fleshy,
exposed part of its armor,

3876
02:28:50,565 --> 02:28:52,174
now it looks like it has
this giant jagged scar

3877
02:28:52,174 --> 02:28:53,007
in the side of its head,

3878
02:28:53,007 --> 02:28:54,690
where you can see muscle and sinew

3879
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:56,479
pulsing with each of its movements.

3880
02:28:56,479 --> 02:28:57,438
You blast into it,

3881
02:28:57,438 --> 02:28:59,478
you can see this darkened black portion

3882
02:28:59,478 --> 02:29:02,472
of its interior flesh, it's now charred,

3883
02:29:02,472 --> 02:29:04,302
slight embers beginning to percolate

3884
02:29:04,302 --> 02:29:08,086
and burn on the outskirts of the impact.

3885
02:29:08,086 --> 02:29:10,762
Well done, you gonna stay where you are?

3886
02:29:10,762 --> 02:29:12,391
ORION: Yes.

3887
02:29:12,391 --> 02:29:13,494
MATT: Scanlan, what you got?

3888
02:29:13,494 --> 02:29:15,935
SAM: Okay, I'm going, I know
he'll get a hit on me,

3889
02:29:15,935 --> 02:29:18,774
but I'm gonna run away
from the guy behind me,

3890
02:29:18,774 --> 02:29:20,719
run straight at the general,

3891
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:25,394
and just open out my arms
in an outstretched big hug,

3892
02:29:25,394 --> 02:29:28,541
and I'm like, come here
big guy, come here!

3893
02:29:28,541 --> 02:29:30,511
And I give him a big hug,
and upon touching him,

3894
02:29:30,511 --> 02:29:31,997
I cast Banishment on him

3895
02:29:31,997 --> 02:29:33,732
and send him to another dimension.

3896
02:29:33,732 --> 02:29:34,793
ORION: Nice!

3897
02:29:34,793 --> 02:29:35,626
MATT: All right.

3898
02:29:35,626 --> 02:29:38,124
(all laugh)

3899
02:29:38,124 --> 02:29:42,357
MATT: As you move away, the duergar
is going to attempt to make,

3900
02:29:42,357 --> 02:29:44,618
as a reaction, to make an attack on you.

3901
02:29:44,618 --> 02:29:46,026
SAM: It's okay, it's all cool for Pike.

3902
02:29:46,026 --> 02:29:49,020
MATT: That's going to be a
13 versus armor class.

3903
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:50,371
SAM: Does not hit.

3904
02:29:50,371 --> 02:29:53,551
MATT: You hear it coming, as
you're walking, "buddy!"

3905
02:29:53,551 --> 02:29:55,647
(all laugh)

3906
02:29:55,647 --> 02:29:57,480
MATT: Duck under a war pick.

3907
02:29:59,395 --> 02:30:00,584
MATT: With advantage on its saving throw.

3908
02:30:00,584 --> 02:30:02,149
What's the DC?

3909
02:30:02,149 --> 02:30:02,982
SAM: DC?

3910
02:30:02,982 --> 02:30:03,816
MATT: The DC on your spell?

3911
02:30:03,816 --> 02:30:07,371
SAM: Well, if I'm doing it
through my cone, it's 19.

3912
02:30:07,371 --> 02:30:09,200
MATT: I will say for this, you do
not have it through your cone,

3913
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:11,151
because you had your arms
open, you didn't specify,

3914
02:30:11,151 --> 02:30:13,579
however, it still fails

3915
02:30:13,579 --> 02:30:16,647
it's saving throw. The
general, as you reach up,

3916
02:30:16,647 --> 02:30:18,203
he has his war pick ready.

3917
02:30:18,203 --> 02:30:22,357
Pulls back its war pick
as the flames burst in.

3918
02:30:22,357 --> 02:30:23,288
(all laugh)

3919
02:30:23,288 --> 02:30:26,578
MATT: Then blinks out of existence.

3920
02:30:26,578 --> 02:30:27,905
(all cheer)

3921
02:30:27,905 --> 02:30:28,795
ORION: Nice move.

3922
02:30:28,795 --> 02:30:29,628
ASHLEY: One down, one down.

3923
02:30:29,628 --> 02:30:32,099
SAM: Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go?

3924
02:30:32,099 --> 02:30:33,590
I don't know.

3925
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:34,870
MATT: How long does it last, by the way?

3926
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:36,168
SAM: It's concentration.

3927
02:30:36,168 --> 02:30:37,795
(all laugh)

3928
02:30:37,795 --> 02:30:39,128
MATT: Okay. All right.

3929
02:30:40,506 --> 02:30:42,570
LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt, playing Vegas,
ladies and gentlemen.

3930
02:30:42,570 --> 02:30:43,981
SAM: Do I get a bonus?

3931
02:30:43,981 --> 02:30:45,084
MATT: You do get a bonus action.

3932
02:30:45,084 --> 02:30:47,426
SAM: Okay, I'm just going
to sing a little ditty

3933
02:30:47,426 --> 02:30:49,931
to Pike, just to give
her a little inspiration.

3934
02:30:49,931 --> 02:30:52,146
I'll just do some pelvic
thrusting--

3935
02:30:52,146 --> 02:30:55,111
a little (guitar),

3936
02:30:55,111 --> 02:30:56,280
that's a flute, by the way.

3937
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:58,049
(all laugh)

3938
02:30:58,049 --> 02:31:00,454
ORION: Super, play that thing.

3939
02:31:00,454 --> 02:31:03,056
MATT: His electric flute gives
you a d8 inspiration dice,

3940
02:31:03,056 --> 02:31:04,995
so you can add that to any attack rolls.

3941
02:31:04,995 --> 02:31:08,629
LIAM: He can do anything with any instrument.

3942
02:31:08,629 --> 02:31:10,003
ASHLEY: Sweet licks on your flute.

3943
02:31:10,003 --> 02:31:12,253
(all laugh)

3944
02:31:16,967 --> 02:31:18,684
MATT: All right, so, Keyleth.

3945
02:31:18,684 --> 02:31:21,775
MARISHA: So, upon seeing this big thing crash in,

3946
02:31:21,775 --> 02:31:23,275
and I'm like, oh.

3947
02:31:24,891 --> 02:31:26,203
Now you're really angry.

3948
02:31:26,203 --> 02:31:29,500
But I just kind of analyze
him and I say okay,

3949
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:32,195
and then I go, (grunts),

3950
02:31:32,195 --> 02:31:34,921
and I turn into a rhinoceros.

3951
02:31:34,921 --> 02:31:35,754
ALL: Ooh!

3952
02:31:37,089 --> 02:31:39,824
MATT: Okay, I don't have a
rhinoceros mini on me,

3953
02:31:39,824 --> 02:31:42,224
so we'll use a bear for the time being,

3954
02:31:42,224 --> 02:31:43,398
but we'll know it's a rhinoceros.

3955
02:31:43,398 --> 02:31:44,807
SAM: Why don't you have a rhinoceros?

3956
02:31:44,807 --> 02:31:46,962
MATT: 'Cause I was not prepared for such things.

3957
02:31:46,962 --> 02:31:48,604
LIAM: Way to slack off, Mercer.

3958
02:31:48,604 --> 02:31:52,637
MATT: Hey, I'm gonna order a
rhinoceros now, you happy?

3959
02:31:52,637 --> 02:31:54,455
I'm gonna go to Toys R Us.

3960
02:31:54,455 --> 02:31:55,791
TALIESIN: Get the whole animal collection.

3961
02:31:55,791 --> 02:31:58,390
Actually got them, the whole set.

3962
02:31:58,390 --> 02:32:00,733
MATT: So you transform into a rhinoceros,

3963
02:32:00,733 --> 02:32:02,572
now basically facing an armored beast

3964
02:32:02,572 --> 02:32:04,405
with an armored beast.

3965
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:07,031
MARISHA: Kaiju battle.

3966
02:32:07,031 --> 02:32:08,963
(all laugh)

3967
02:32:08,963 --> 02:32:09,796
MATT: Whatcha got, whatcha doing?

3968
02:32:09,796 --> 02:32:11,393
MARISHA: I'm charging him.

3969
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:16,407
TRAVIS: Activity in the Breach.

3970
02:32:16,407 --> 02:32:18,516
MATT: You leap down, go in for the attack,

3971
02:32:18,516 --> 02:32:20,313
this duergar already used its reaction,

3972
02:32:20,313 --> 02:32:21,578
so it can't attack you.

3973
02:32:21,578 --> 02:32:25,161
MARISHA: So if he fails to save, I knock him over.

3974
02:32:26,394 --> 02:32:28,975
That's plus seven, so 19?

3975
02:32:28,975 --> 02:32:29,970
MATT: 19 does hit.

3976
02:32:29,970 --> 02:32:30,803
MARISHA: Awesome!

3977
02:32:32,039 --> 02:32:33,495
MATT: Does save though, is not knocked over.

3978
02:32:33,495 --> 02:32:34,396
MARISHA: A strength save?

3979
02:32:34,396 --> 02:32:35,229
MATT: Yeah.

3980
02:32:35,229 --> 02:32:36,062
MARISHA: Aw, damn it.

3981
02:32:36,062 --> 02:32:38,041
MATT: This is a big creature.

3982
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:39,541
MARISHA: He does, I do

3983
02:32:40,941 --> 02:32:43,006
2d8 of bludgeoning damage.

3984
02:32:43,006 --> 02:32:44,006
MATT: Go for it.

3985
02:32:45,782 --> 02:32:48,593
MARISHA: Seven, nine, 14 damage.

3986
02:32:48,593 --> 02:32:50,343
MATT: 14 damage, all right.

3987
02:32:51,562 --> 02:32:53,080
You have multi attack or
did you get the one hit?

3988
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,529
MARISHA: Well, I charged, yeah.

3989
02:32:54,529 --> 02:32:55,924
MATT: Okay yeah, so the charge is the hit.

3990
02:32:55,924 --> 02:32:57,797
But you slam into it, your horn gores,

3991
02:32:57,797 --> 02:32:58,630
you can see actually,

3992
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:00,545
you slam it into the
side of the armor wound

3993
02:33:00,545 --> 02:33:03,307
that Grog left and then
Tiberius pried open.

3994
02:33:03,307 --> 02:33:04,222
Part of it gets pulled back,

3995
02:33:04,222 --> 02:33:06,809
and you see a quick
splatter of some sort of

3996
02:33:06,809 --> 02:33:10,094
bloody splash as you're
staring to actually

3997
02:33:10,094 --> 02:33:12,367
pull apart its interior.

3998
02:33:12,367 --> 02:33:13,693
The horn is jabbed in there,

3999
02:33:13,693 --> 02:33:15,730
and it manages to shrug
it off at the last point.

4000
02:33:15,730 --> 02:33:17,920
You do significant gore to its side.

4001
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:18,837
LIAM: Good musical riff.

4002
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,912
MARISHA: Oh, wait.

4003
02:33:21,912 --> 02:33:24,739
No no no, that's right, keep going.

4004
02:33:24,739 --> 02:33:27,189
It's actually 15 damage.

4005
02:33:27,189 --> 02:33:29,435
I always forget that I have a plus
one to attack.

4006
02:33:29,435 --> 02:33:30,268
MATT: 15? Yeah, don't forget that.

4007
02:33:30,268 --> 02:33:31,101
You need to remember that.

4008
02:33:36,412 --> 02:33:38,580
After taking the arrow wound,

4009
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:40,136
and after everyone else
attacking around it,

4010
02:33:40,136 --> 02:33:42,467
it's going to try and get
a different situation.

4011
02:33:42,467 --> 02:33:44,050
It's going to jump.

4012
02:33:45,202 --> 02:33:49,072
It rears back, and leaps into the air.

4013
02:33:49,072 --> 02:33:49,905
SAM: Oh jesus.

4014
02:33:51,824 --> 02:33:55,895
MATT: Landing right on top
of Clarota and Scanlan.

4015
02:33:55,895 --> 02:33:57,062
SAM: Oh no!

4016
02:33:59,192 --> 02:34:00,622
ASHLEY: Wait, does he get, do we get--

4017
02:34:00,622 --> 02:34:03,917
MATT: You guys all get attacks
on it as it jumps away.

4018
02:34:03,917 --> 02:34:04,828
MARISHA: We all get attacks?

4019
02:34:04,828 --> 02:34:05,661
MATT: Yes, you do.

4020
02:34:05,661 --> 02:34:06,676
SAM: Do I?

4021
02:34:06,676 --> 02:34:07,696
MATT: No, you do not.

4022
02:34:07,696 --> 02:34:08,912
MARISHA: We get advantage, right?

4023
02:34:08,912 --> 02:34:09,745
MATT: No.

4024
02:34:09,745 --> 02:34:11,644
TALIESIN: Did he take me, no he didn't take me.

4025
02:34:11,644 --> 02:34:14,149
MATT: No, actually, you are still in its hand.

4026
02:34:14,149 --> 02:34:16,133
In its mouth, it carries you with it.

4027
02:34:18,729 --> 02:34:19,562
MARISHA: 19.

4028
02:34:20,999 --> 02:34:23,471
MATT: Okay, so 19, you hit.

4029
02:34:23,471 --> 02:34:24,491
LIAM: 24.
MATT: Hit.

4030
02:34:24,491 --> 02:34:25,408
TRAVIS: 26.
MATT: Hit.

4031
02:34:29,627 --> 02:34:30,781
No, it's the three of you, so that's it.

4032
02:34:30,781 --> 02:34:32,966
So all of you guys just roll
damage for a basic attack.

4033
02:34:32,966 --> 02:34:34,282
SAM: Come on, kill him before he gets to me.

4034
02:34:34,282 --> 02:34:35,275
TRAVIS: 24.

4035
02:34:35,275 --> 02:34:36,275
MATT: 24 damage?

4036
02:34:37,673 --> 02:34:38,918
24 damage you said?

4037
02:34:38,918 --> 02:34:39,751
Nice.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4038
02:34:39,751 --> 02:34:41,385
ASHLEY: Was I close enough to
him to get an attack?

4039
02:34:41,385 --> 02:34:43,382
MATT: No you weren't, unfortunately.

4040
02:34:43,382 --> 02:34:44,215
LIAM: 11.

4041
02:34:44,215 --> 02:34:45,607
MATT: 11, all righty, and?

4042
02:34:45,607 --> 02:34:46,440
MARISHA: 17.

4043
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,471
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4044
02:34:47,471 --> 02:34:48,971
MATT: So, as it lands.

4045
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,045
All of you guys have to make a strength

4046
02:34:53,045 --> 02:34:56,123
or dex saving throw, your choice.

4047
02:34:56,123 --> 02:34:57,714
For Percy.

4048
02:34:57,714 --> 02:34:59,117
TALIESIN: Dex.

4049
02:34:59,117 --> 02:35:02,832
MATT: And Scanlan, and I'm rolling for Clarota.

4050
02:35:02,832 --> 02:35:03,999
Clarota fails.

4051
02:35:05,190 --> 02:35:06,219
TALIESIN: 20.

4052
02:35:06,219 --> 02:35:08,829
MATT: It's okay, it's okay, Scanlan.

4053
02:35:08,829 --> 02:35:10,301
It's okay, you can do this.

4054
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:13,134
MATT: What'd you roll?
TALIESIN: 20.

4055
02:35:14,133 --> 02:35:16,153
SAM: He's coming back from the other dimension.

4056
02:35:16,153 --> 02:35:17,486
I rolled a nine.

4057
02:35:20,295 --> 02:35:21,658
ORION: Did it hit the floor or did you go again?

4058
02:35:21,658 --> 02:35:23,823
SAM: No, I used the one that
rolled on the floor.

4059
02:35:23,823 --> 02:35:25,288
LAURA: Roll it on the table, that doesn't count.

4060
02:35:25,288 --> 02:35:27,527
MATT: So Clarota is not prone.

4061
02:35:27,527 --> 02:35:30,372
SAM: Dungeon Master, does a
roll on the floor count?

4062
02:35:30,372 --> 02:35:31,205
What happened?

4063
02:35:31,205 --> 02:35:32,038
MATT: I usually roll on the table.

4064
02:35:32,038 --> 02:35:33,957
I usually prefer to roll on the table.

4065
02:35:33,957 --> 02:35:34,893
SAM: It's even worse.

4066
02:35:34,893 --> 02:35:37,299
(all laugh)

4067
02:35:37,299 --> 02:35:38,661
LIAM: That'll learn ya.

4068
02:35:38,661 --> 02:35:41,090
MATT: You guys are knocked prone on the ground,

4069
02:35:41,090 --> 02:35:45,292
and you all take 14 points
of bludgeoning damage,

4070
02:35:45,292 --> 02:35:47,293
plus 14 points of slashing damage.

4071
02:35:47,293 --> 02:35:48,693
As he just lands on top of you.

4072
02:35:48,693 --> 02:35:51,445
Yeah, so 28 points of
damage, as it crushes you,

4073
02:35:51,445 --> 02:35:53,169
and its claws sink into you.

4074
02:35:53,169 --> 02:35:54,951
Clarota takes the same.

4075
02:35:54,951 --> 02:35:56,571
LIAM: Did it drag Percy through the air?

4076
02:35:56,571 --> 02:35:57,834
TALIESIN: Yes it did.

4077
02:35:57,834 --> 02:35:58,706
LAURA: It did?

4078
02:35:58,706 --> 02:36:01,091
TALIESIN: My arms are still stuck in its mouth.

4079
02:36:01,091 --> 02:36:01,924
MATT: You're not knocked prone,

4080
02:36:01,924 --> 02:36:04,210
but you do take 14 points
of crushing damage,

4081
02:36:04,210 --> 02:36:07,163
as its mouth bites down on
your arm again, for free.

4082
02:36:07,163 --> 02:36:07,996
TALIESIN: That's fine.

4083
02:36:07,996 --> 02:36:11,663
MATT: It's going to actually release you, Percy.

4084
02:36:13,684 --> 02:36:15,706
So you're there.

4085
02:36:15,706 --> 02:36:16,539
MARISHA: Think your arm might be a 
bit busted.

4086
02:36:16,539 --> 02:36:21,124
MATT: It turns, and makes a bite
attack against Scanlan.

4087
02:36:21,124 --> 02:36:22,374
SCANLAN: As he does

4088
02:36:23,687 --> 02:36:24,937
I distract him.

4089
02:36:26,344 --> 02:36:29,131
(air horn blowing)

4090
02:36:29,131 --> 02:36:31,350
(all laugh)

4091
02:36:31,350 --> 02:36:32,767
SAM: Playing my shawm.

4092
02:36:33,663 --> 02:36:35,390
MATT: That's the sound a shawm makes?

4093
02:36:35,390 --> 02:36:36,756
SAM: Cutting Words reaction.

4094
02:36:36,756 --> 02:36:37,954
MATT: Okay, so as your reaction,

4095
02:36:37,954 --> 02:36:39,905
go ahead and do that, so roll the d8.

4096
02:36:39,905 --> 02:36:41,840
ASHLEY: (imitates horn)

4097
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:43,800
TRAVIS: It's like the start of a Pitbull song.

4098
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:44,892
SAM: Six.

4099
02:36:44,892 --> 02:36:47,424
MATT: Okay, he rolled a 27.

4100
02:36:47,424 --> 02:36:49,114
Reduced it by seven to 19.

4101
02:36:49,114 --> 02:36:51,140
So even with the reduction, it's not enough,

4102
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:52,890
you're on the ground.

4103
02:36:54,784 --> 02:36:56,796
It sinks its teeth right into you.

4104
02:36:56,796 --> 02:36:58,629
You take, let's see.

4105
02:37:02,573 --> 02:37:04,465
LIAM: These games keep getting better.

4106
02:37:04,465 --> 02:37:06,691
MATT: You take 41 points of piercing damage.

4107
02:37:06,691 --> 02:37:08,796
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4108
02:37:08,796 --> 02:37:09,698
LIAM: Scanlan!

4109
02:37:09,698 --> 02:37:12,303
SAM: No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now.

4110
02:37:12,303 --> 02:37:13,814
(all laugh)

4111
02:37:13,814 --> 02:37:14,647
MARISHA: Really?

4112
02:37:14,647 --> 02:37:15,480
SAM: Yep.

4113
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:16,989
MATT: Okay, so.

4114
02:37:16,989 --> 02:37:19,427
MARISHA: Wait, how did that happen?

4115
02:37:19,427 --> 02:37:20,736
TALIESIN: That happened fast.

4116
02:37:20,736 --> 02:37:22,323
LIAM: He's unconscious, he's in bad shape,

4117
02:37:22,323 --> 02:37:23,156
but we're gonna get him.

4118
02:37:23,156 --> 02:37:23,989
MATT: Scanlan's looking rough,

4119
02:37:23,989 --> 02:37:25,818
Scanlan is now just being thrashed around

4120
02:37:25,818 --> 02:37:26,651
in the mouth of the creature.

4121
02:37:26,651 --> 02:37:27,630
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

4122
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:30,217
MATT: His limp arms and legs
just (thumping)

4123
02:37:30,217 --> 02:37:32,346
as it's kind of just running him around

4124
02:37:32,346 --> 02:37:33,659
and across the air.

4125
02:37:33,659 --> 02:37:35,126
LIAM: Hashtag save Scanlan.

4126
02:37:35,126 --> 02:37:37,582
Strings of gnome blood are
being flung across the room.

4127
02:37:37,582 --> 02:37:41,227
LIAM: Oh, he's so little though, he's so little.

4128
02:37:41,227 --> 02:37:42,140
MATT: Pike, your turn.

4129
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:44,890
ASHLEY: Okay, so time for a Cure Wounds.

4130
02:37:45,816 --> 02:37:46,733
So I guess.

4131
02:37:47,722 --> 02:37:49,259
Let's see.

4132
02:37:49,259 --> 02:37:51,714
MATT: You can't even see him right now.

4133
02:37:51,714 --> 02:37:54,004
If you want to Cure Wounds,
you have to touch him.

4134
02:37:54,004 --> 02:37:56,560
ASHLEY: I'll go, yeah, I'll go.

4135
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:58,396
SAM: I'm being thrashed around.

4136
02:37:58,396 --> 02:38:00,660
ASHLEY: Can I just go, he's over there?

4137
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:02,425
LAURA: He's in the mouth of the thing.

4138
02:38:02,425 --> 02:38:03,753
LIAM: She's 25 speed.

4139
02:38:03,753 --> 02:38:06,239
MATT: So you can move five squares.

4140
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:07,266
ASHLEY: Okay.

4141
02:38:07,266 --> 02:38:09,932
MARISHA: Didn't you get that speed boost?

4142
02:38:09,932 --> 02:38:11,216
ASHLEY: How close can I get to him?

4143
02:38:11,216 --> 02:38:12,764
I can't see the lines in the squares.

4144
02:38:12,764 --> 02:38:14,201
ORION: Don't forget your boots, Pike.

4145
02:38:14,201 --> 02:38:16,701
ASHLEY: Oh, I have sprinter's boots!

4146
02:38:17,548 --> 02:38:19,515
I have sprinter's boots.

4147
02:38:21,266 --> 02:38:25,239
Okay, so I'm gonna use
my sprinter's boots.

4148
02:38:25,239 --> 02:38:26,072
I can--

4149
02:38:27,042 --> 02:38:29,183
While you wear these boots,
you can use a bonus action,

4150
02:38:29,183 --> 02:38:30,969
and click the boots' heels together,

4151
02:38:30,969 --> 02:38:32,870
if you do, the boots
double your walking speed

4152
02:38:32,870 --> 02:38:33,787
for one minute.

4153
02:38:33,787 --> 02:38:36,102
MATT: So you can move ten squares,
takes your bonus action.

4154
02:38:36,102 --> 02:38:39,057
ASHLEY: So then, I'm so sorry, I
can't see the squares.

4155
02:38:39,057 --> 02:38:40,963
So if I can get ten to get over there.

4156
02:38:40,963 --> 02:38:43,906
MATT: So you go one, two, three, four, five,

4157
02:38:43,906 --> 02:38:47,443
six, seven, eight, there is a ledge there,

4158
02:38:47,443 --> 02:38:49,891
and he's blocking the way up, so nine, ten,

4159
02:38:49,891 --> 02:38:51,627
make an acrobatics check to actually

4160
02:38:51,627 --> 02:38:53,837
jump and climb up onto the--

4161
02:38:53,837 --> 02:38:55,397
LAURA: Oh no.

4162
02:38:55,397 --> 02:39:00,056
MATT: With disadvantage, 'cause
you have plate armor.

4163
02:39:00,056 --> 02:39:02,911
LIAM: But what about her--

4164
02:39:02,911 --> 02:39:04,903
MATT: Disadvantage, you roll
twice and take a lower.

4165
02:39:04,903 --> 02:39:06,736
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, hold on.

4166
02:39:07,594 --> 02:39:09,844
Can I cast Guided Strike?

4167
02:39:09,844 --> 02:39:11,427
Which adds ten to--

4168
02:39:13,292 --> 02:39:15,052
SAM: I gave you a dice.

4169
02:39:15,052 --> 02:39:17,290
I gave you a dice.

4170
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:20,002
LIAM: Which means you're--

4171
02:39:20,002 --> 02:39:20,835
Ten.

4172
02:39:20,835 --> 02:39:21,671
MATT: Total of ten?

4173
02:39:21,671 --> 02:39:22,504
LIAM: Yeah.

4174
02:39:22,504 --> 02:39:23,337
MATT: That's exactly what you needed.

4175
02:39:23,337 --> 02:39:24,545
(all cheer)

4176
02:39:24,545 --> 02:39:25,885
MATT: That was the baseline. You run up,

4177
02:39:25,885 --> 02:39:27,817
it takes all the strength you can feel,

4178
02:39:27,817 --> 02:39:28,796
you're gonna be sore in the morning.

4179
02:39:28,796 --> 02:39:30,962
All your muscles tense
as you pull yourself up,

4180
02:39:30,962 --> 02:39:33,409
with all the inertia from the run,

4181
02:39:33,409 --> 02:39:35,912
your parkour up to the top, land,

4182
02:39:35,912 --> 02:39:37,864
Scanlan's there, currently
being flung around,

4183
02:39:37,864 --> 02:39:39,386
you manage to reach up and grab him,

4184
02:39:39,386 --> 02:39:42,601
and get in a brief tug of war
with the bulette creature.

4185
02:39:42,601 --> 02:39:44,474
ASHLEY: Hey, get away from him, man!

4186
02:39:44,474 --> 02:39:46,308
MATT: As you cast Cure Wounds.

4187
02:39:46,308 --> 02:39:47,391
Go ahead and--

4188
02:39:48,251 --> 02:39:51,320
ASHLEY: So that's Mass Cure Wounds, so does that heal--

4189
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:52,969
MATT: Is it Mass Cure Wounds, or
just doing Cure Wounds?

4190
02:39:52,969 --> 02:39:54,390
ASHLEY: I'll just do Cure Wounds.

4191
02:39:54,390 --> 02:39:56,263
MATT: So at what level are you using?

4192
02:39:56,263 --> 02:39:57,144
SAM: Don't chintz out.

4193
02:39:57,144 --> 02:39:58,634
ASHLEY: I'm gonna use it at the highest-- I'll use it at fifth level.

4194
02:39:58,634 --> 02:39:59,823
SAM: Cast whatever you can cast.

4195
02:39:59,823 --> 02:40:00,819
LIAM: It's one or multiple people.

4196
02:40:00,819 --> 02:40:02,832
SAM: Can you do it at a higher level?

4197
02:40:02,832 --> 02:40:04,672
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do it at my highest
level that I can cast,

4198
02:40:04,672 --> 02:40:05,505
which is--

4199
02:40:05,505 --> 02:40:07,391
SAM: Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here.

4200
02:40:07,391 --> 02:40:11,009
ASHLEY: Sorry guys, I'm just warming up again.

4201
02:40:11,009 --> 02:40:13,259
(all laugh)

4202
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:16,907
TRAVIS: Let's not skimp on Scanlan.

4203
02:40:18,631 --> 02:40:20,646
LIAM: Remember when I brought
you back from the dead?

4204
02:40:20,646 --> 02:40:21,733
Remember that? Remember that?

4205
02:40:21,733 --> 02:40:23,958
SAM: Remember when my kiss
healed you from death?

4206
02:40:23,958 --> 02:40:25,142
Just throwing that out there.

4207
02:40:25,142 --> 02:40:26,164
ASHLEY: -- which I think is eight.

4208
02:40:26,164 --> 02:40:28,150
MATT: So it's 5d8 + 5.

4209
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:31,053
5d8 + 5 is how
much you're healing him.

4210
02:40:31,053 --> 02:40:31,886
LIAM: You're gonna be all right.

4211
02:40:31,886 --> 02:40:34,040
ASHLEY: My spell attack bonus, plus eight?

4212
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:35,137
MATT: You don't have to worry about the bonus,

4213
02:40:35,137 --> 02:40:35,970
you're just touching him.

4214
02:40:35,970 --> 02:40:37,261
ASHLEY: So 5d8 + 5.

4215
02:40:37,261 --> 02:40:40,094
MATT: Is what you're healing him, yes.

4216
02:40:46,771 --> 02:40:47,604
All right.

4217
02:40:49,297 --> 02:40:50,130
SAM: That's three.

4218
02:40:50,130 --> 02:40:53,019
LIAM: I think you did it four times, yeah.

4219
02:40:53,019 --> 02:40:53,852
ASHLEY: 18, plus five.

4220
02:40:53,852 --> 02:40:56,435
SAM: I thought that was three, no?

4221
02:40:57,333 --> 02:40:59,263
ASHLEY: Yeah, 23, 23.

4222
02:40:59,263 --> 02:41:00,838
SAM: Plus five.

4223
02:41:00,838 --> 02:41:03,261
LIAM: That was plus five.

4224
02:41:03,261 --> 02:41:04,699
LAURA: Are you still unconscious?

4225
02:41:04,699 --> 02:41:07,282
SAM: But now I'm only negative 11.

4226
02:41:08,168 --> 02:41:09,753
ASHLEY: Wait, what?

4227
02:41:09,753 --> 02:41:12,967
SAM: I've taken almost 100
points of damage in this.

4228
02:41:12,967 --> 02:41:15,446
MATT: You're unconscious, how it works in this,

4229
02:41:15,446 --> 02:41:17,317
and this is different from Pathfinder--

4230
02:41:17,317 --> 02:41:18,592
Yeah, you go to zero and you stay there.

4231
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:20,519
You are now up to 23.

4232
02:41:20,519 --> 02:41:22,291
LIAM: You don't go below zero, you hit zero,

4233
02:41:22,291 --> 02:41:25,289
and you're there, making
rolls to see if you die.

4234
02:41:25,289 --> 02:41:27,544
LAURA: You only have three chances if you roll,

4235
02:41:27,544 --> 02:41:29,361
fail, three times, you die.

4236
02:41:29,361 --> 02:41:31,111
MATT: And if something hits you
while you're unconscious,

4237
02:41:31,111 --> 02:41:32,526
it's an automatic fail.

4238
02:41:32,526 --> 02:41:34,330
Now you're 23 hit points.

4239
02:41:34,330 --> 02:41:36,305
SAM: Hey, I feel great, guys!
(all laugh)

4240
02:41:36,305 --> 02:41:38,165
MATT: You're still in its
mouth being shook around.

4241
02:41:38,165 --> 02:41:40,734
SAM: Oh shit!
(all laugh)

4242
02:41:40,734 --> 02:41:43,683
SAM: What is this ride?

4243
02:41:43,683 --> 02:41:44,850
This is crazy!

4244
02:41:45,774 --> 02:41:47,948
MATT: Pike, that's your turn.

4245
02:41:47,948 --> 02:41:49,099
ASHLEY: I can't do anything else, right?

4246
02:41:49,099 --> 02:41:50,887
MATT: Clarota's going to get up.

4247
02:41:50,887 --> 02:41:52,452
LIAM: Come on Clarota, show us what you got.

4248
02:41:52,452 --> 02:41:54,743
MATT: Clarota looks pretty rough.

4249
02:41:54,743 --> 02:41:55,576
Rears back.

4250
02:41:55,576 --> 02:41:56,693
LIAM: Got to bring that mental power

4251
02:41:56,693 --> 02:41:59,737
and that arcane magic, let's do it.

4252
02:41:59,737 --> 02:42:03,288
MATT: Taking a cue from the opening you left,

4253
02:42:03,288 --> 02:42:05,621
Clarota pulls back its hand,

4254
02:42:06,683 --> 02:42:09,725
you see a familiar spark
of bluish electrical energy

4255
02:42:09,725 --> 02:42:11,911
as Clarota reaches for
unleashing a torrent

4256
02:42:11,911 --> 02:42:13,362
of electrical arcane energy forward,

4257
02:42:13,362 --> 02:42:14,998
into the form of a Lightning Bolt.

4258
02:42:14,998 --> 02:42:18,997
Blasting across the bow
of this giant creature.

4259
02:42:18,997 --> 02:42:19,830
Let's see.

4260
02:42:21,105 --> 02:42:24,438
Does not make its saving throw, so it's

4261
02:42:30,816 --> 02:42:32,369
32 points of lightning damage.

4262
02:42:32,369 --> 02:42:33,202
LAURA: Clarota!

4263
02:42:34,674 --> 02:42:36,187
MATT: As the back of its armor is now seared,

4264
02:42:36,187 --> 02:42:38,266
and you can see parts of its armored flesh

4265
02:42:38,266 --> 02:42:42,240
are kind of blackened and
charred and slightly crimping.

4266
02:42:43,073 --> 02:42:44,355
Vax, you're up.

4267
02:42:44,355 --> 02:42:45,476
LIAM: Okay,

4268
02:42:45,476 --> 02:42:49,050
so I've got enough room
to run up to its anus,

4269
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:50,258
which I'll do.

4270
02:42:50,258 --> 02:42:51,542
TRAVIS: As you always do.

4271
02:42:51,542 --> 02:42:52,492
LIAM: It's got plenty of people around,

4272
02:42:52,492 --> 02:42:54,249
so that means I can Sneak Attack him.

4273
02:42:54,249 --> 02:42:57,101
MATT: As you rush past, before you attack?

4274
02:42:57,101 --> 02:42:58,745
This duergar that was right by you,

4275
02:42:58,745 --> 02:43:00,799
that has currently grown to a larger size

4276
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:01,863
gets a free swing at you.

4277
02:43:01,863 --> 02:43:03,055
LIAM: Ain't no thing.

4278
02:43:03,055 --> 02:43:05,382
MATT: That's going to be a 21 to hit.

4279
02:43:05,382 --> 02:43:06,500
LIAM: Okay, that hits.

4280
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:09,833
MATT: All right, with its war pike it takes--

4281
02:43:10,737 --> 02:43:13,843
deals 14 points of damage to you.

4282
02:43:13,843 --> 02:43:16,313
LIAM: Who cares, I'm saving
my gnome friend, okay.

4283
02:43:16,313 --> 02:43:17,146
Here I go.

4284
02:43:18,932 --> 02:43:21,432
14, it's a 25 to hit his butt.

4285
02:43:22,369 --> 02:43:23,202
MATT: 25 hits.

4286
02:43:24,310 --> 02:43:26,388
LIAM: This is my keen dagger, with vorpal blade,

4287
02:43:26,388 --> 02:43:29,252
two plus seven is nine, that's just nine.

4288
02:43:29,252 --> 02:43:31,266
Where's a pencil, that's a pencil.

4289
02:43:31,266 --> 02:43:33,149
And then we add my Sneak Attack damage,

4290
02:43:33,149 --> 02:43:35,149
which is six, seven, ten.

4291
02:43:38,158 --> 02:43:38,991
15.

4292
02:43:39,967 --> 02:43:41,717
21, plus nine, is 30.

4293
02:43:44,557 --> 02:43:46,499
MATT: All right, nice.

4294
02:43:46,499 --> 02:43:47,401
LIAM: To the butt.

4295
02:43:47,401 --> 02:43:48,402
Specifically to the butt.

4296
02:43:48,402 --> 02:43:49,286
MATT: As you rush up,

4297
02:43:49,286 --> 02:43:51,099
you take a moment as it's thrashing about,

4298
02:43:51,099 --> 02:43:53,679
and you can see what looks, anatomy-wise,

4299
02:43:53,679 --> 02:43:55,721
to be probably where it
expels whatever it eats.

4300
02:43:55,721 --> 02:43:57,055
LIAM: The hole? Right in there.

4301
02:43:57,055 --> 02:43:59,708
MATT: You go ahead and just
slash and eviscerate there.

4302
02:43:59,708 --> 02:44:01,045
LIAM: How do you like me now?

4303
02:44:01,045 --> 02:44:02,858
MATT: Even back there it's heavily armored,

4304
02:44:02,858 --> 02:44:06,079
it takes, you carve through, and it--

4305
02:44:06,079 --> 02:44:08,542
You've definitely left a lasting
impression on this bulette.

4306
02:44:08,542 --> 02:44:09,375
LIAM: Pucker up, baby, pucker up.

4307
02:44:09,375 --> 02:44:10,695
SAM: Hashtag, armored anus.

4308
02:44:10,695 --> 02:44:13,470
(all laugh)

4309
02:44:13,470 --> 02:44:15,005
TRAVIS: What, what, in the butt.

4310
02:44:15,005 --> 02:44:17,689
LIAM: This is D&amp;D in 2015, people, 2015.

4311
02:44:17,689 --> 02:44:18,730
So that's the first attack, right?

4312
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:19,731
Now I get a second attack?

4313
02:44:19,731 --> 02:44:21,014
MATT: The general also, by the way,

4314
02:44:21,014 --> 02:44:23,703
appears as the
concentration spell was lost

4315
02:44:23,703 --> 02:44:24,871
as you were unconscious.

4316
02:44:24,871 --> 02:44:27,608
SAM: I must have stopped
concentrating for some reason.

4317
02:44:27,608 --> 02:44:30,187
MATT: However, it is right
in front of, it's like.

4318
02:44:32,177 --> 02:44:33,728
It's now in his face.

4319
02:44:33,728 --> 02:44:35,061
LIAM: Second attack.

4320
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:37,823
22.

4321
02:44:37,823 --> 02:44:39,411
MATT: That hits.

4322
02:44:39,411 --> 02:44:41,581
Okay, and that's a four plus ten,

4323
02:44:41,581 --> 02:44:45,164
ten points of fire-based
damage to the butt.

4324
02:44:46,083 --> 02:44:47,042
MATT: All right.

4325
02:44:47,042 --> 02:44:49,292
(all laugh)

4326
02:44:50,432 --> 02:44:51,765
TRAVIS: Preparation H?

4327
02:44:53,123 --> 02:44:55,606
Fire damage to the anus.

4328
02:44:55,606 --> 02:44:58,023
MATT: That brings us to his turn.

4329
02:44:59,548 --> 02:45:00,381
LAURA: The general's?

4330
02:45:00,381 --> 02:45:02,523
MATT: The general's turn, who now
is there from the bulette,

4331
02:45:02,523 --> 02:45:04,751
sees it, looks over and sees you.

4332
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:06,044
TRAVIS: It's right in front of him!

4333
02:45:06,044 --> 02:45:09,271
MATT: Kind of sitting there
with your bloody hand.

4334
02:45:09,271 --> 02:45:13,466
It's still flaming, swings
back, and goes for your head.

4335
02:45:13,466 --> 02:45:14,692
TALIESIN: God.

4336
02:45:14,692 --> 02:45:17,460
MATT: That is a 23 versus armor class.

4337
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:19,793
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah, that's gonna hit.

4338
02:45:21,936 --> 02:45:22,935
Armor class sucks.

4339
02:45:22,935 --> 02:45:23,982
MATT: Plus the fire damage.

4340
02:45:23,982 --> 02:45:25,217
ASHLEY: What are you at?

4341
02:45:25,217 --> 02:45:26,282
TALIESIN: I'm at

4342
02:45:26,282 --> 02:45:27,532
39 I wanna say?

4343
02:45:29,429 --> 02:45:32,103
MATT: Well, you take 31 points of damage.

4344
02:45:32,103 --> 02:45:33,902
Including the fire damage from the pike,

4345
02:45:33,902 --> 02:45:36,330
it goes for its second attack against you.

4346
02:45:36,330 --> 02:45:37,263
TRAVIS: This thing sucks.

4347
02:45:37,263 --> 02:45:39,863
MATT: That's gonna be a 22 versus armor class.

4348
02:45:39,863 --> 02:45:41,052
TALIESIN: That's gonna hit.

4349
02:45:41,052 --> 02:45:42,210
LIAM: It's a tank.

4350
02:45:42,210 --> 02:45:43,043
TRAVIS: One.

4351
02:45:43,043 --> 02:45:44,126
MATT: You take...

4352
02:45:46,280 --> 02:45:48,223
That's gonna be 21 points of damage.

4353
02:45:48,223 --> 02:45:49,165
TALIESIN: I'm out.

4354
02:45:49,165 --> 02:45:53,165
Okay, Percy being pummeled
and pummeled again.

4355
02:45:54,093 --> 02:45:55,926
Loses, your gun falls from your hand,

4356
02:45:55,926 --> 02:45:58,265
as you slump to the ground,
your eyes roll back,

4357
02:45:58,265 --> 02:45:59,853
unconsciousness and darkness.

4358
02:45:59,853 --> 02:46:00,686
SAM: We're droppin' like flies!

4359
02:46:00,686 --> 02:46:01,942
MATT: Taking you.

4360
02:46:01,942 --> 02:46:03,773
That brings us to--

4361
02:46:03,773 --> 02:46:05,736
ASHLEY: Everybody knows shit's fucked.

4362
02:46:05,736 --> 02:46:06,569
MATT: Grog.

4363
02:46:06,569 --> 02:46:08,641
TRAVIS: What, me? Bah!

4364
02:46:08,641 --> 02:46:10,197
How tall is the thing?

4365
02:46:10,197 --> 02:46:13,844
MATT: Tall? I'd say it's probably about...

4366
02:46:13,844 --> 02:46:16,549
20 feet tall? 15, 20 feet tall?

4367
02:46:16,549 --> 02:46:18,307
TRAVIS: Can I climb up on its back?

4368
02:46:18,307 --> 02:46:21,189
MATT: It's not your size, it'd be really, really

4369
02:46:21,189 --> 02:46:22,389
tight, pinning in there.

4370
02:46:22,389 --> 02:46:24,143
TRAVIS: I would like to run up to its right side

4371
02:46:24,143 --> 02:46:25,581
and flank it.

4372
02:46:25,581 --> 02:46:26,851
MATT: Over here?

4373
02:46:26,851 --> 02:46:27,750
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4374
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:29,417
MATT: So you run around.

4375
02:46:31,958 --> 02:46:33,869
Which you can do, 'cause
you're a freaking barbarian.

4376
02:46:33,869 --> 02:46:35,683
TRAVIS: (snarls)

4377
02:46:35,683 --> 02:46:36,971
MATT: All right, go ahead, you're
making your attacks.

4378
02:46:36,971 --> 02:46:39,355
Go for it, three strikes against it.

4379
02:46:39,355 --> 02:46:40,188
TRAVIS: 21.

4380
02:46:41,106 --> 02:46:41,939
Hits, right?

4381
02:46:41,939 --> 02:46:43,332
MATT: 21 definitely hits.

4382
02:46:43,332 --> 02:46:44,568
TRAVIS: 16 plus eight, hits.

4383
02:46:44,568 --> 02:46:45,873
MATT: Definitely hits.

4384
02:46:45,873 --> 02:46:46,963
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

4385
02:46:46,963 --> 02:46:49,219
(all cheer)

4386
02:46:49,219 --> 02:46:50,491
TRAVIS: Does that mean I get extra?

4387
02:46:50,491 --> 02:46:51,730
LIAM: Double damage, it means double damage.

4388
02:46:51,730 --> 02:46:52,997
TRAVIS: Oh, double damage, okay.

4389
02:46:52,997 --> 02:46:54,059
MATT: So first strike.

4390
02:46:54,059 --> 02:46:56,178
ASHLEY: Kill him, kill him, kill him!

4391
02:46:59,562 --> 02:47:00,871
TRAVIS: 16?

4392
02:47:00,871 --> 02:47:02,371
MATT: 16 damage?
TRAVIS: Yes.

4393
02:47:04,292 --> 02:47:05,204
LAURA: 21.

4394
02:47:05,204 --> 02:47:06,444
TRAVIS: 21, thank you.

4395
02:47:06,444 --> 02:47:07,978
LIAM: Stay in school, kids.

4396
02:47:07,978 --> 02:47:08,967
TRAVIS: Stay on the table.

4397
02:47:08,967 --> 02:47:11,723
MATT: It's the critical now,
so double the dice roll.

4398
02:47:11,723 --> 02:47:13,473
TRAVIS: 20, thank you, and.

4399
02:47:15,169 --> 02:47:16,669
15, plus that, 20.

4400
02:47:18,254 --> 02:47:20,731
MATT: You double the dice,
then add the modifier.

4401
02:47:20,731 --> 02:47:22,071
TRAVIS: Oh, double the second one.

4402
02:47:22,071 --> 02:47:24,027
LAURA: So that's 40 on the last one.

4403
02:47:24,027 --> 02:47:24,920
SAM: Jesus.

4404
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:25,920
LAURA: So 61, 76.
MATT: How do you want to do this, Grog?

4405
02:47:27,771 --> 02:47:30,021
(all cheer)

4406
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:31,913
ASHLEY: Oh, you killed him?

4407
02:47:31,913 --> 02:47:32,982
LIAM: Yes!

4408
02:47:32,982 --> 02:47:34,333
MATT: How you wanna do this, Grog?

4409
02:47:34,333 --> 02:47:37,286
TRAVIS: I would like to chop
down into the fleshy bit,

4410
02:47:37,286 --> 02:47:38,544
and after I've sliced--

4411
02:47:38,544 --> 02:47:39,892
MATT: The fleshy bit is on the
opposite side, by the way.

4412
02:47:39,892 --> 02:47:41,691
So you're now at an unarmored side.

4413
02:47:41,691 --> 02:47:43,612
However, it's still holding
Scanlan in its mouth,

4414
02:47:43,612 --> 02:47:45,648
shaking him around, so,
how do you wanna finish it?

4415
02:47:45,648 --> 02:47:48,154
TRAVIS: Can I get to its mouth at all?

4416
02:47:48,154 --> 02:47:49,361
MATT: I could say for the flavor of this,

4417
02:47:49,361 --> 02:47:51,460
yeah, you manage to just
barely make it over here.

4418
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:52,518
TRAVIS: I would like to swing through

4419
02:47:52,518 --> 02:47:53,861
and catch the corner of its mouth,

4420
02:47:53,861 --> 02:47:56,359
open its mouth wide, and
then I'd like to reach in,

4421
02:47:56,359 --> 02:47:59,640
and with my teeth, pull its
fucking tongue out of its head,

4422
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:01,607
and start thrashing it side to side.

4423
02:48:01,607 --> 02:48:02,655
(all laugh)

4424
02:48:02,655 --> 02:48:04,937
MATT: First you rush up with your ax,

4425
02:48:04,937 --> 02:48:07,584
using all of the aggression,
you take it and swing it,

4426
02:48:07,584 --> 02:48:10,251
barely leaving you with a shave.

4427
02:48:11,114 --> 02:48:12,449
You gash the side of its mouth,

4428
02:48:12,449 --> 02:48:14,292
and draw this giant wound open.

4429
02:48:14,292 --> 02:48:15,886
As it does, you actually snap,

4430
02:48:15,886 --> 02:48:18,414
and cut through the tendons
that clench the jaw,

4431
02:48:18,414 --> 02:48:19,720
causing it to fall open and slack.

4432
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:21,030
Scanlan spills out of its mouth,

4433
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:22,664
hitting the ground with a dull thud.

4434
02:48:22,664 --> 02:48:25,215
As its mouth is now open,
it kind of rears back.

4435
02:48:25,215 --> 02:48:26,320
You shake your head angrily,

4436
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:28,681
as the froth is gathering at
the corners of your mouth.

4437
02:48:28,681 --> 02:48:32,259
You drop your ax from
one hand, grab the jaw,

4438
02:48:32,259 --> 02:48:35,945
reach in, bite down on
its giant meaty tongue.

4439
02:48:35,945 --> 02:48:37,365
Using your hand at the back of it,

4440
02:48:37,365 --> 02:48:39,777
you pull and yank and you feel the muscle

4441
02:48:39,777 --> 02:48:42,264
tearing and tensing before,
eventually it comes free,

4442
02:48:42,264 --> 02:48:45,236
and is now dangling about 25, 30 pounds,

4443
02:48:45,236 --> 02:48:47,736
of very very wet, tongue meat.

4444
02:48:50,327 --> 02:48:51,929
With your third attack,
how do you finish it?

4445
02:48:51,929 --> 02:48:54,088
(all laugh)

4446
02:48:54,088 --> 02:48:56,538
TRAVIS: What do you after you're biting
its tongue in your mouth?

4447
02:48:56,538 --> 02:48:57,393
MATT: That's what I'm asking.

4448
02:48:57,393 --> 02:48:58,349
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

4449
02:48:58,349 --> 02:48:59,227
MATT: It's looking really rough,

4450
02:48:59,227 --> 02:49:00,741
but you still need to get
that final death blow.

4451
02:49:00,741 --> 02:49:01,963
What are you doing with this, Grog?

4452
02:49:01,963 --> 02:49:02,871
ASHLEY: Rip him apart.

4453
02:49:02,871 --> 02:49:05,383
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw.

4454
02:49:05,383 --> 02:49:07,195
I'm gonna take the broken
part, the top of his head,

4455
02:49:07,195 --> 02:49:09,050
and just pull apart.

4456
02:49:09,050 --> 02:49:11,512
MATT: Okay, so you drop your ax entirely,

4457
02:49:11,512 --> 02:49:13,522
the tongue still dangling from your mouth.

4458
02:49:13,522 --> 02:49:16,415
You reach and put one foot up
into the bottom of the jaw,

4459
02:49:16,415 --> 02:49:18,438
using your other hands you push and push,

4460
02:49:18,438 --> 02:49:20,521
you hear it crack, and pull,

4461
02:49:20,521 --> 02:49:22,018
as it tenses and is trying to push down.

4462
02:49:22,018 --> 02:49:24,187
It has no tension because
the jaw was destroyed.

4463
02:49:24,187 --> 02:49:26,867
You pull back and hear a sickening snap,

4464
02:49:26,867 --> 02:49:28,763
as the armor plate buckles underneath

4465
02:49:28,763 --> 02:49:31,184
where the neck joint would
be on such a creature.

4466
02:49:31,184 --> 02:49:33,095
Its eyes kinda roll back for a second,

4467
02:49:33,095 --> 02:49:34,671
and it begins to slacken.

4468
02:49:34,671 --> 02:49:36,309
As it does, you reach up with your fist,

4469
02:49:36,309 --> 02:49:39,098
and penetrate the bottom of
where its brain would be.

4470
02:49:39,098 --> 02:49:41,654
With a sickening (suction) sound,

4471
02:49:41,654 --> 02:49:44,500
it goes entirely limp and
collapses on the ground.

4472
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:46,229
LIAM: And that's why you're on the team.

4473
02:49:46,229 --> 02:49:48,236
(all cheer)

4474
02:49:48,236 --> 02:49:49,191
TRAVIS: And as it falls,

4475
02:49:49,191 --> 02:49:51,070
the tongue that's hanging in my mouth,

4476
02:49:51,070 --> 02:49:53,540
I look to one of the
dwarves that's left, I go,

4477
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:55,122
who's next?

4478
02:49:55,122 --> 02:49:56,613
(all laugh)

4479
02:49:56,613 --> 02:49:57,702
MATT: We're gonna end it there for the night.

4480
02:49:57,702 --> 02:49:59,952
(all groan)

4481
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:04,073
MATT: Damn guys, well done.

4482
02:50:04,073 --> 02:50:05,147
TALIESIN: I'm sleeping.

4483
02:50:05,147 --> 02:50:07,860
SAM: Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy.

4484
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:10,351
LAURA: I want more chicken.

4485
02:50:10,351 --> 02:50:11,583
MATT: Before we finish, I'd say go ahead

4486
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:12,729
and throw a heal up on him.

4487
02:50:12,729 --> 02:50:13,571
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

4488
02:50:13,571 --> 02:50:14,832
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4489
02:50:14,832 --> 02:50:15,832
ASHLEY: Good plan.

4490
02:50:18,056 --> 02:50:19,588
MATT: It's nasty, man.

4491
02:50:19,588 --> 02:50:21,717
You guys picked that, by the way.

4492
02:50:21,717 --> 02:50:23,772
LAURA: Oh seriously?
TRAVIS: They did?

4493
02:50:23,772 --> 02:50:24,635
You dicks!

4494
02:50:24,635 --> 02:50:25,552
TALIESIN: You suck.

4495
02:50:26,888 --> 02:50:28,251
ZAC: That was the chat room.

4496
02:50:28,251 --> 02:50:29,915
ORION: Try harder next time.

4497
02:50:29,915 --> 02:50:31,487
MATT: We'll be doing more of
those as time goes on.

4498
02:50:31,487 --> 02:50:32,320
Not all the time,

4499
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:33,983
but whenever I have the
opportunity to put it in there,

4500
02:50:33,983 --> 02:50:35,072
I'm gonna start asking for you guys

4501
02:50:35,072 --> 02:50:37,583
to help me figure out what
to throw at these adventurers.

4502
02:50:37,583 --> 02:50:38,817
LIAM: You sadists.

4503
02:50:38,817 --> 02:50:40,107
(all laugh)

4504
02:50:40,107 --> 02:50:41,006
ZAC: We shouldn't tell them the other options,
should we,

4505
02:50:41,006 --> 02:50:43,077
just in case we wanna save them.

4506
02:50:43,077 --> 02:50:45,392
MATT: Oh no, they'll come back in, don't worry.

4507
02:50:45,392 --> 02:50:46,225
ASHLEY: 25.

4508
02:50:46,225 --> 02:50:48,121
TALIESIN: Oh wow, I feel much better.

4509
02:50:48,121 --> 02:50:51,642
ZAC: So you guys, we're gonna
be doing a Q and A.

4510
02:50:51,642 --> 02:50:53,396
MATT: Yeah, for anyone who wants to stay over.

4511
02:50:53,396 --> 02:50:54,451
ZAC: Anyone who wants to stick around,

4512
02:50:54,451 --> 02:50:57,342
the audience has a ton of
questions for you guys.

4513
02:50:57,342 --> 02:51:00,051
For the audience, it's a sub-only Q and A,

4514
02:51:00,051 --> 02:51:02,955
so if you're been wondering
whether or not you should sub,

4515
02:51:02,955 --> 02:51:05,008
let me give you some reasons why.

4516
02:51:05,008 --> 02:51:07,645
Number one, you can ask
these guys questions

4517
02:51:07,645 --> 02:51:08,827
in a little bit.

4518
02:51:08,827 --> 02:51:10,167
Number two, every 50 subs,

4519
02:51:10,167 --> 02:51:12,918
we're giving away tabletop promo kits

4520
02:51:12,918 --> 02:51:17,062
that are like $250 worth of special stuff,

4521
02:51:17,062 --> 02:51:19,347
and we will ship that internationally,

4522
02:51:19,347 --> 02:51:20,180
doesn't matter.

4523
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:21,337
Even in Antarctica.

4524
02:51:21,337 --> 02:51:23,718
We want someone in Antarctica
to do tabletop day,

4525
02:51:23,718 --> 02:51:25,445
do you know anyone?

4526
02:51:25,445 --> 02:51:26,278
MATT: I don't.

4527
02:51:27,608 --> 02:51:29,835
ZAC: We had someone last year.

4528
02:51:29,835 --> 02:51:31,284
MATT: Well shit, we gotta reach out then.

4529
02:51:31,284 --> 02:51:33,606
ZAC: They're gone, they were
like the only people there,

4530
02:51:33,606 --> 02:51:34,439
and they're gone.

4531
02:51:34,439 --> 02:51:36,637
MATT: There's nobody there left,
they were the last bastion.

4532
02:51:36,637 --> 02:51:38,300
Well, somebody needs to move to Antarctica

4533
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:40,336
in the next few days and let us know,

4534
02:51:40,336 --> 02:51:41,400
so then we can totally use that.

4535
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:44,470
ZAC: We also do a Minecraft
server, for subs only,

4536
02:51:44,470 --> 02:51:45,471
but if you want in on that,

4537
02:51:45,471 --> 02:51:47,810
there's no automated message
for that server info,

4538
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:51,299
so just make sure and message
the Geek &amp; Sundry account,

4539
02:51:51,299 --> 02:51:54,376
and we'll get you that sub IP address

4540
02:51:54,376 --> 02:51:55,991
for the Minecraft server.

4541
02:51:55,991 --> 02:51:58,619
I know we have more,
there's lots more stuff.

4542
02:51:58,619 --> 02:52:01,599
We do some other sub-only
chats throughout the week.

4543
02:52:01,599 --> 02:52:03,725
lots of emotes, other fun stuff.

4544
02:52:03,725 --> 02:52:05,691
But we're gonna go ahead
and roll some videos

4545
02:52:05,691 --> 02:52:08,008
while we get set up for the Q and A.

4546
02:52:08,008 --> 02:52:09,291
This was a lot of fun, oh!

4547
02:52:09,291 --> 02:52:12,459
I would like to challenge
you guys to do a quick

4548
02:52:12,459 --> 02:52:14,796
little donation drive for the charity

4549
02:52:14,796 --> 02:52:16,125
that you guys support.

4550
02:52:16,125 --> 02:52:17,625
MATT: Yeah, for 826LA.

4551
02:52:18,543 --> 02:52:19,922
Had it going up in the chat room,

4552
02:52:19,922 --> 02:52:20,806
if you have the opportunity,

4553
02:52:20,806 --> 02:52:22,878
you wanna help support these children

4554
02:52:22,878 --> 02:52:25,961
getting side educations and tutoring.

4555
02:52:28,641 --> 02:52:30,881
ZAC: You guys
wanna tell them about,

4556
02:52:30,881 --> 02:52:32,503
just to get them psyched up for it?

4557
02:52:32,503 --> 02:52:34,024
'Cause we can get that command going.

4558
02:52:34,024 --> 02:52:36,916
MARISHA: Yeah, 826LA, they're a
non-profit organization

4559
02:52:36,916 --> 02:52:40,037
that helps primarily with literacy

4560
02:52:40,037 --> 02:52:42,767
and creative story children for children

4561
02:52:42,767 --> 02:52:45,850
between the ages of like five and 18.

4562
02:52:46,915 --> 02:52:50,498
They have a really
great young authors book

4563
02:52:51,939 --> 02:52:53,234
that you can buy that's a collection

4564
02:52:53,234 --> 02:52:54,566
of all of the kids' book,

4565
02:52:54,566 --> 02:52:57,992
and you can also go and check
out the time travel mart,

4566
02:52:57,992 --> 02:52:59,293
there's one in Echo Park and then

4567
02:52:59,293 --> 02:53:01,245
there's also one in Marina Del Rey.

4568
02:53:01,245 --> 02:53:03,232
But you should just google 826,

4569
02:53:03,232 --> 02:53:05,076
'cause I know there's one in Seattle,

4570
02:53:05,076 --> 02:53:06,680
I know there's one in like Atlanta.

4571
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:08,837
New York, San Francisco.

4572
02:53:08,837 --> 02:53:11,014
There might be an 826 in your city.

4573
02:53:11,014 --> 02:53:12,550
LIAM: 826LA probably, right?

4574
02:53:12,550 --> 02:53:15,800
MARISHA: 826LA is who we're raising money for.

4575
02:53:17,605 --> 02:53:19,823
But yeah all of the 826 store fronts

4576
02:53:19,823 --> 02:53:22,122
are a little bit different,
depending on where you go.

4577
02:53:22,122 --> 02:53:23,160
They're super cool.

4578
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,042
MATT: Guys, please, check it out, it's awesome.

4579
02:53:25,042 --> 02:53:28,046
It's a good group of people,
what they do is fantastic.

4580
02:53:28,046 --> 02:53:29,706
If you have the opportunity please do,

4581
02:53:29,706 --> 02:53:31,248
go ahead and donate to the charity.

4582
02:53:31,248 --> 02:53:33,033
MATT: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in

4583
02:53:33,033 --> 02:53:34,774
for the fourth episode of Critical Role,

4584
02:53:34,774 --> 02:53:36,531
with the grand return of Pike, our cleric.

4585
02:53:36,531 --> 02:53:38,662
(all laugh)

4586
02:53:38,662 --> 02:53:39,791
MATT: Necessary.

4587
02:53:39,791 --> 02:53:40,624
Glad to have you back,

4588
02:53:40,624 --> 02:53:42,761
I'm sure everyone here is
glad to have the healer back.

4589
02:53:42,761 --> 02:53:44,633
LAURA: Especially today.

4590
02:53:44,633 --> 02:53:46,671
TALIESIN: Very happy today.

4591
02:53:46,671 --> 02:53:49,772
MATT: And a surprise return of Laura, so.

4592
02:53:49,772 --> 02:53:51,173
LAURA: What a time to join the game.

4593
02:53:51,173 --> 02:53:52,161
MATT: Heck yeah.

4594
02:53:52,161 --> 02:53:53,567
All right guys, well, we're
gonna take a little bit

4595
02:53:53,567 --> 02:53:54,630
to set up for the Q and A.

4596
02:53:54,630 --> 02:53:56,294
Those who can stay, feel free to,

4597
02:53:56,294 --> 02:53:57,320
those who can't, totally understand.

4598
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:58,937
We have kids and families to get to.

4599
02:53:58,937 --> 02:54:00,266
Those who can will be here for the Q and A

4600
02:54:00,266 --> 02:54:01,381
for the next hour or so.

4601
02:54:01,381 --> 02:54:02,214
ZAC: One more thing,

4602
02:54:02,214 --> 02:54:05,111
just so they know we're following through.

4603
02:54:05,111 --> 02:54:08,062
We have the picture for you guys to sign.

4604
02:54:08,062 --> 02:54:12,468
So Niareth won this, when
we reached 1,000 subs,

4605
02:54:12,468 --> 02:54:14,618
so I think Pike is all
that's left for that.

4606
02:54:14,618 --> 02:54:16,312
MATT: Pike is left to sign
this Player's Handbook.

4607
02:54:16,312 --> 02:54:17,145
SAM: I haven't signed it.

4608
02:54:17,145 --> 02:54:19,995
ZAC: And then we've got the picture.

4609
02:54:19,995 --> 02:54:23,822
So we'll pass that around
while we're doing the set up.

4610
02:54:23,822 --> 02:54:25,687
MATT: Do any of you have the gold marker?

4611
02:54:25,687 --> 02:54:26,645
ZAC: I'll find it.

4612
02:54:26,645 --> 02:54:27,478
MATT: All right, cool.

4613
02:54:27,478 --> 02:54:28,548
Yeah guys we're gonna go
ahead and set up for this,

4614
02:54:28,548 --> 02:54:30,110
we'll see you in a little
bit for the Q and A,

4615
02:54:30,110 --> 02:54:32,114
thank you everyone for watching.

4616
02:54:32,114 --> 02:54:32,947
Thanks guys.

4617
02:54:32,947 --> 02:54:34,247
Awesome day at Critical Role, thanks.

4618
02:54:34,247 --> 02:54:35,080
ASHLEY: Bye!

4619
02:54:36,542 --> 02:54:38,726
WIL: Hey nerds, I'm Wil Wheaton, I know right?

4620
02:54:38,726 --> 02:54:39,578
And guess what?

4621
02:54:39,578 --> 02:54:40,481
It is back.

4622
02:54:40,481 --> 02:54:43,119
International Tabletop Day has returned,

4623
02:54:43,119 --> 02:54:45,797
this year on April 11th.

4624
02:54:45,797 --> 02:54:46,779
What is that, you say?

4625
02:54:46,779 --> 02:54:48,376
What is Tabletop Day?

4626
02:54:48,376 --> 02:54:51,292
Well, if you don't
know, then shame on you.

4627
02:54:51,292 --> 02:54:54,202
International Tabletop Day
is a worldwide celebration

4628
02:54:54,202 --> 02:54:56,901
dedicated to the tabletop games we love

4629
02:54:56,901 --> 02:54:59,183
to play with the people we love.

4630
02:54:59,183 --> 02:55:01,036
People we like, people
we've never even met before,

4631
02:55:01,036 --> 02:55:01,869
it doesn't matter,

4632
02:55:01,869 --> 02:55:04,016
last year we had over
3,000 registered events

4633
02:55:04,016 --> 02:55:07,227
across seven continents
and over 80 countries,

4634
02:55:07,227 --> 02:55:08,242
that is amazing!

4635
02:55:08,242 --> 02:55:12,045
But this year we're going
to make it even bigger.

4636
02:55:12,045 --> 02:55:14,348
"Will Wheaton, how can
we make it even bigger

4637
02:55:14,348 --> 02:55:15,375
"than last year?"

4638
02:55:15,375 --> 02:55:16,375
That's what she said.

4639
02:55:16,375 --> 02:55:17,208
Start now.

02:56:03,113 --> 02:56:04,446
Play more games.

4660
02:56:05,951 --> 02:56:07,252
Hey everybody, I'm Wil Wheaton,

4661
02:56:07,252 --> 02:56:09,101
and I am coming to you semi-live

4662
02:56:09,101 --> 02:56:12,187
from the Twitch TV set here
at the Geek &amp; Sundry stages

4663
02:56:12,187 --> 02:56:14,181
in beautiful downtown Burbank, California.

4664
02:56:14,181 --> 02:56:17,444
I am here to tell you
everything you ever wanted

4665
02:56:17,444 --> 02:56:19,982
to know about Tabletop's RPG show,

4666
02:56:19,982 --> 02:56:22,475
coming this June, but were afraid to ask.

4667
02:56:22,475 --> 02:56:24,135
Or have been asking for close to a year

4668
02:56:24,135 --> 02:56:24,968
and I've been saying,

4669
02:56:24,968 --> 02:56:27,488
"We'll tell you at some
point in the future."

4670
02:56:27,488 --> 02:56:30,983
You can consider this
the big announcement.

4671
02:56:30,983 --> 02:56:33,694
It was incredibly difficult
to cast this show.

4672
02:56:33,694 --> 02:56:35,716
We needed people who were very comfortable

4673
02:56:35,716 --> 02:56:39,010
improvising, who had experience
playing role playing games,

4674
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:42,374
and who were available when
we planned to shoot the show.

4675
02:56:42,374 --> 02:56:45,311
It was surprisingly difficult
to get a pool of people

4676
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:47,885
who fit all of those criteria,

4677
02:56:47,885 --> 02:56:50,470
and choose the most awesome among them.

4678
02:56:50,470 --> 02:56:55,044
So your cast playing in
this wonderful show are:

4679
02:56:55,044 --> 02:56:58,544
Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Hank Green,

4680
02:56:59,643 --> 02:57:01,338
and Alison Haislip.

4681
02:57:01,338 --> 02:57:03,277
I'm really excited to have
these people all together.

4682
02:57:03,277 --> 02:57:04,638
They're all my friends,

4683
02:57:04,638 --> 02:57:06,856
they are all wonderful storytellers,

4684
02:57:06,856 --> 02:57:10,271
and they are going to
be a tremendous party

4685
02:57:10,271 --> 02:57:11,596
of adventurers.

4686
02:57:11,596 --> 02:57:14,584
I'm only gonna try to
kill them a little bit.

4687
02:57:14,584 --> 02:57:16,034
The most frequently asked question

4688
02:57:16,034 --> 02:57:17,739
since I announced that
there was going to be

4689
02:57:17,739 --> 02:57:20,629
a Tabletop RPG show is, hey Wil Wheaton!

4690
02:57:20,629 --> 02:57:22,468
Why are you so awesome?

4691
02:57:22,468 --> 02:57:24,574
The second most frequently
asked question is,

4692
02:57:24,574 --> 02:57:28,324
what system are you
using to power this game?

4693
02:57:29,162 --> 02:57:30,226
First and foremost,

4694
02:57:30,226 --> 02:57:31,779
I needed a system that
was going to support

4695
02:57:31,779 --> 02:57:34,119
the way I play roleplaying games,

4696
02:57:34,119 --> 02:57:37,820
and that is telling a
story collaboratively

4697
02:57:37,820 --> 02:57:40,532
with a group of players with me as the GM.

4698
02:57:40,532 --> 02:57:42,491
I looked at some very well known systems

4699
02:57:42,491 --> 02:57:44,971
like Dungeons &amp; Dragons,
and Savage Worlds,

4700
02:57:44,971 --> 02:57:48,327
I looked at systems that
I love, like Fate Core,

4701
02:57:48,327 --> 02:57:52,494
and I even looked at the
True 20, a d20 modern system.

4702
02:57:53,329 --> 02:57:55,156
And I really wanted to use something

4703
02:57:55,156 --> 02:57:58,019
that was released by an
independent publisher.

4704
02:57:58,019 --> 02:58:01,818
I wanted to bring
something to the forefront

4705
02:58:01,818 --> 02:58:04,714
of the roleplaying world
that maybe not as many

4706
02:58:04,714 --> 02:58:08,335
people are familiar with
as I want them to be.

4707
02:58:08,335 --> 02:58:09,919
But I wanna play the way that I played

4708
02:58:09,919 --> 02:58:12,239
when I was falling in love
with roleplaying games

4709
02:58:12,239 --> 02:58:13,127
when I was a kid.

4710
02:58:13,127 --> 02:58:14,975
I wanna be able to sit around on a couch

4711
02:58:14,975 --> 02:58:16,368
and some chairs with my friends,

4712
02:58:16,368 --> 02:58:19,110
not have to worry about a map
on a table in front of us,

4713
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:21,659
and just work together
to use our imaginations

4714
02:58:21,659 --> 02:58:22,687
to tell a story.

4715
02:58:22,687 --> 02:58:24,621
But there's a system that I really love

4716
02:58:24,621 --> 02:58:27,213
that's elegant, it's easy to learn,

4717
02:58:27,213 --> 02:58:30,299
it's easy to teach, it's
very easy to understand,

4718
02:58:30,299 --> 02:58:33,989
and it really just gets out of the way

4719
02:58:33,989 --> 02:58:36,688
when you want to tell a story together.

4720
02:58:36,688 --> 02:58:39,002
And that is the Adventure Game Engine

4721
02:58:39,002 --> 02:58:41,335
that Green Ronin Publishing used

4722
02:58:41,335 --> 02:58:44,652
to drive the Dragon Age
tabletop roleplaying game.

4723
02:58:44,652 --> 02:58:47,408
I asked the developer three years ago

4724
02:58:47,408 --> 02:58:49,325
to please make generic,

4725
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:52,453
so that we can build a
setting and put on top of it.

4726
02:58:52,453 --> 02:58:54,599
They said actually this is
something we really wanna do.

4727
02:58:54,599 --> 02:58:56,193
And it's come together.

4728
02:58:56,193 --> 02:58:58,955
We have been able to work
together with Green Ronin

4729
02:58:58,955 --> 02:59:02,066
to develop the fantasy
Adventure Game Engine.

4730
02:59:02,066 --> 02:59:04,122
This is gonna take a lot
of the things you know

4731
02:59:04,122 --> 02:59:05,718
from the Dragon Age RPG,

4732
02:59:05,718 --> 02:59:09,476
and put it all together
to support our world,

4733
02:59:09,476 --> 02:59:12,809
which I have had the best time creating.

4734
02:59:14,309 --> 02:59:18,476
I sat down three months ago
with some amazing writers,

4735
02:59:20,154 --> 02:59:23,635
and just started brainstorming
about what kind of world

4736
02:59:23,635 --> 02:59:25,318
we wanted to explore.

4737
02:59:25,318 --> 02:59:27,965
But what I kept coming back to is,

4738
02:59:27,965 --> 02:59:31,548
I love science fiction,
and I love fantasy.

4739
02:59:32,606 --> 02:59:34,844
Why not put them together?

4740
02:59:34,844 --> 02:59:38,598
Why not build a world that is inspired by

4741
02:59:38,598 --> 02:59:40,848
the 1978 Heavy Metal movie,

4742
02:59:42,575 --> 02:59:46,658
and 1980's amazing Saturday
morning cartoon show,

4743
02:59:47,676 --> 02:59:49,831
Thundarr the Barbarian.

4744
02:59:49,831 --> 02:59:51,786
I thought it would be great for characters

4745
02:59:51,786 --> 02:59:54,800
to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures,

4746
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:56,735
and instead of them using crossbows,

4747
02:59:56,735 --> 02:59:58,412
they're using laser rifles.

4748
02:59:58,412 --> 03:00:00,076
I've got it all worked out,

4749
03:00:00,076 --> 03:00:02,737
we have a huge team of writers
that put all this together

4750
03:00:02,737 --> 03:00:04,218
that built an amazing codex

4751
03:00:04,218 --> 03:00:07,394
that gave terrific logic to all of these

4752
03:00:07,394 --> 03:00:09,928
decisions that we made.

4753
03:00:09,928 --> 03:00:11,381
We're not gonna tell you what they are.

4754
03:00:11,381 --> 03:00:13,361
You may discover some of
them during the course

4755
03:00:13,361 --> 03:00:14,831
of the season.

4756
03:00:14,831 --> 03:00:17,989
So what is the name of
this incredible world?

4757
03:00:17,989 --> 03:00:22,985
The title of our show is
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana.

4758
03:00:22,985 --> 03:00:24,720
You can sort of come
up with your own ideas

4759
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,938
about what those words mean.

4760
03:00:26,938 --> 03:00:28,401
I know, but I'm not telling.

4761
03:00:28,401 --> 03:00:31,884
'Cause that's not how the Wheaton talks.

4762
03:00:31,884 --> 03:00:34,176
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana

4763
03:00:34,176 --> 03:00:37,694
will premiere right here
at Geekandsundry.com

4764
03:00:37,694 --> 03:00:38,694
on June 2nd.

4765
03:00:39,758 --> 03:00:41,875
For those of you not in America,

4766
03:00:41,875 --> 03:00:44,062
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana

4767
03:00:44,062 --> 03:00:47,298
will premiere right here on Geek &amp; Sundry

4768
03:00:47,298 --> 03:00:48,783
on two June.

4769
03:00:48,783 --> 03:00:51,861
So I hope that you're as
excited about this as I am,

4770
03:00:51,861 --> 03:00:53,295
and I hope that you will tune in,

4771
03:00:53,295 --> 03:00:55,539
and then watch us for ten straight weeks

4772
03:00:55,539 --> 03:00:57,728
of incredible high
adventure story telling,

4773
03:00:57,728 --> 03:01:00,202
and until then, play more games.

4774
03:01:00,202 --> 03:01:02,319
IVAN: Hey guys, Ivan here, the
host of Game the Game,

4775
03:01:02,319 --> 03:01:04,199
on Geek &amp; Sundry's new Twitch channel.

4776
03:01:04,199 --> 03:01:06,202
I'm here with Becca, Ify, and Hector,

4777
03:01:06,202 --> 03:01:08,880
to get you excited about
International Tabletop Day.

4778
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:10,171
So International Tabletop Day

4779
03:01:10,171 --> 03:01:11,699
is going to be on April 11th,

4780
03:01:11,699 --> 03:01:13,692
and all of our friends
at AEG have brought us

4781
03:01:13,692 --> 03:01:15,725
an amazing edition of Love Letter

4782
03:01:15,725 --> 03:01:17,342
in order to play with you today.

4783
03:01:17,342 --> 03:01:19,205
That's right nerds.

4784
03:01:19,205 --> 03:01:21,419
It's Batman Love Letter.

4785
03:01:21,419 --> 03:01:23,494
Now Batman Love Letter is a game of logic,

4786
03:01:23,494 --> 03:01:24,799
deduction, and risk,

4787
03:01:24,799 --> 03:01:27,037
in which you try to capture or hold

4788
03:01:27,037 --> 03:01:29,052
the highest value card in your hand

4789
03:01:29,052 --> 03:01:30,442
by the end of the rounds.

4790
03:01:30,442 --> 03:01:32,355
In the meantime we'll all be playing cards

4791
03:01:32,355 --> 03:01:34,022
in order to eliminate each other.

4792
03:01:34,022 --> 03:01:36,352
But whoever has the highest-value card

4793
03:01:36,352 --> 03:01:39,405
at the end of the round will win a token.

4794
03:01:39,405 --> 03:01:42,600
So who will be the greatest
detective in all of Gotham?

4795
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:43,679
It's gonna be Batman.

4796
03:01:43,679 --> 03:01:46,871
BECCA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it'll be Poison Ivy.

4797
03:01:46,871 --> 03:01:50,382
IFY: You guys both are wrong,
it's going to be Bane.

4798
03:01:50,382 --> 03:01:52,428
HECTOR: It's probably not gonna be Robin.

4799
03:01:52,428 --> 03:01:54,084
(all laugh)

4800
03:01:54,084 --> 03:01:56,537
IVAN: Now, normally we will
play until seven tokens,

4801
03:01:56,537 --> 03:01:58,171
but for the purposes of this video,

4802
03:01:58,171 --> 03:01:59,751
we'll play until three.

4803
03:01:59,751 --> 03:02:01,610
Whoever gets three is gonna win.

4804
03:02:01,610 --> 03:02:03,200
Let's play.

4805
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:05,726
Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.

4806
03:02:05,726 --> 03:02:06,559
BECCA: Burn the first?

4807
03:02:06,559 --> 03:02:08,144
IVAN: Burn the first.

4808
03:02:08,144 --> 03:02:10,343
You have to burn a card
before you even begin,

4809
03:02:10,343 --> 03:02:12,213
because there is a mystery card

4810
03:02:12,213 --> 03:02:13,962
that isn't in play normally.

4811
03:02:13,962 --> 03:02:15,809
So keep that in mind when you're playing.

4812
03:02:15,809 --> 03:02:17,441
HECTOR: Burning a card, who are we playing with?

4813
03:02:17,441 --> 03:02:18,858
The Batman villain Firefly?

4814
03:02:18,858 --> 03:02:20,179
(all laugh)

4815
03:02:20,179 --> 03:02:22,248
IFY: Leave the jokes to me, Robin.

4816
03:02:22,248 --> 03:02:23,282
HECTOR: All right, fine.

4817
03:02:23,282 --> 03:02:26,595
IFY: Just so you know, I'm doing
a set at the comedy store,

4818
03:02:26,595 --> 03:02:29,518
and I need three friends to show up.

4819
03:02:29,518 --> 03:02:30,632
HECTOR: What night is it?

4820
03:02:30,632 --> 03:02:31,596
I'm busy that night.

4821
03:02:31,596 --> 03:02:34,351
IFY: I didn't even give you the time yet.

4822
03:02:34,351 --> 03:02:36,419
IVAN: Hector, why don't you go first?

4823
03:02:36,419 --> 03:02:37,699
HECTOR: Robin.

4824
03:02:37,699 --> 03:02:39,485
IVAN: Robin, the man wonder.

4825
03:02:39,485 --> 03:02:41,068
HECTOR: Okay, here we go.

4826
03:02:43,901 --> 03:02:45,651
I'm gonna play Robin.

4827
03:02:48,074 --> 03:02:50,845
I've got protection for
my entire next round.

4828
03:02:50,845 --> 03:02:51,678
IVAN: Right.

4829
03:02:51,678 --> 03:02:53,344
So every single time you play a card,

4830
03:02:53,344 --> 03:02:55,954
normally it has an action
that is attached to it.

4831
03:02:55,954 --> 03:02:57,807
So I'm playing Catwoman,

4832
03:02:57,807 --> 03:03:00,526
who allows me to look at
another player's hand.

4833
03:03:00,526 --> 03:03:01,443
Poison Ivy?

4834
03:03:03,827 --> 03:03:05,448
Noted.

4835
03:03:05,448 --> 03:03:06,281
Now it's your turn.

4836
03:03:06,281 --> 03:03:09,193
BECCA: It's my turn, so I draw a card.

4837
03:03:09,193 --> 03:03:11,737
I'm gonna hang on to that one, maybe.

4838
03:03:11,737 --> 03:03:13,544
And I also play Catwoman.

4839
03:03:13,544 --> 03:03:16,627
And I'm going to look at Bane's hand.

4840
03:03:18,415 --> 03:03:19,324
That's terrible.

4841
03:03:19,324 --> 03:03:22,427
IFY: You make fun of me but
you lack the understanding

4842
03:03:22,427 --> 03:03:23,677
of my strategy.

4843
03:03:25,014 --> 03:03:27,163
I will play the Batman.

4844
03:03:27,163 --> 03:03:30,144
I can't guess Robin's
because he has immunity,

4845
03:03:30,144 --> 03:03:32,039
but I can guess Poison Ivy's.

4846
03:03:32,039 --> 03:03:33,246
IVAN: If he can guess correctly,

4847
03:03:33,246 --> 03:03:34,362
not only does he get a token,

4848
03:03:34,362 --> 03:03:35,963
but she's eliminated from the round,

4849
03:03:35,963 --> 03:03:37,939
and now there's only
three of us available.

4850
03:03:37,939 --> 03:03:39,892
So it's one step closer to victory.

4851
03:03:39,892 --> 03:03:41,183
What's your guess?

4852
03:03:41,183 --> 03:03:43,345
IFY: My guess is Two-Face.

4853
03:03:43,345 --> 03:03:44,897
BECCA: Incorrect.

4854
03:03:44,897 --> 03:03:45,818
IVAN: Robin?

4855
03:03:45,818 --> 03:03:47,175
HECTOR: Thanks, Batman.

4856
03:03:47,175 --> 03:03:48,842
All right, here we go.

4857
03:03:50,998 --> 03:03:52,965
I'm also gonna play Batman.

4858
03:03:52,965 --> 03:03:56,895
I'm gonna guess that Poison
Ivy has the Joker card.

4859
03:03:56,895 --> 03:03:57,945
BECCA: Incorrect.

4860
03:03:57,945 --> 03:03:58,936
HECTOR: Darn it.

4861
03:03:58,936 --> 03:04:00,791
Jiminey Jillickers.

4862
03:04:00,791 --> 03:04:03,539
BECCA: Now you have to do something
terribly embarrassing, right?

4863
03:04:03,539 --> 03:04:04,468
Or is that just Half Scrolls?

4864
03:04:04,468 --> 03:04:06,735
HECTOR: Like maybe wear a Robin
costume, cool, sounds good.

4865
03:04:06,735 --> 03:04:08,482
Oh, already doing it, great.

4866
03:04:08,482 --> 03:04:09,794
So great.

4867
03:04:09,794 --> 03:04:13,502
IVAN: I have two cards and I'm going to

4868
03:04:13,502 --> 03:04:15,553
also play the Batman.

4869
03:04:15,553 --> 03:04:17,332
You've been picked on a lot, Poison Ivy.

4870
03:04:17,332 --> 03:04:18,904
BECCA: I've been picked on so much.

4871
03:04:18,904 --> 03:04:21,524
IVAN: You played a Batman.

4872
03:04:21,524 --> 03:04:22,596
HECTOR: Get him Batman.

4873
03:04:22,596 --> 03:04:24,331
IVAN: I'm gonna guess you've got a Poison Ivy.

4874
03:04:24,331 --> 03:04:25,498
IFY: You're wrong!

4875
03:04:25,498 --> 03:04:27,214
IVAN: (groans)

4876
03:04:27,214 --> 03:04:28,607
IFY: No survivors!

4877
03:04:28,607 --> 03:04:30,086
IVAN: (laughs)

4878
03:04:30,086 --> 03:04:32,649
All right, I'm done, go ahead, Poison Ivy.

4879
03:04:32,649 --> 03:04:34,790
BECCA: If anyone's wondering
why so many Batman cards

4880
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:36,752
are being drawn, it's because
there are five in the deck.

4881
03:04:36,752 --> 03:04:39,371
There's either one or two
of all the other characters.

4882
03:04:39,371 --> 03:04:43,288
So I draw, and I will
play, myself, Poison Ivy.

4883
03:04:46,052 --> 03:04:47,302
This card says,

4884
03:04:48,190 --> 03:04:50,423
choose any player including yourself

4885
03:04:50,423 --> 03:04:53,775
to discard his or her
hand, and draw a new card.

4886
03:04:53,775 --> 03:04:55,560
Ivan, you look pretty confident.

4887
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:56,474
Discard.

4888
03:04:56,474 --> 03:04:57,307
IVAN: Discard, all right.

4889
03:04:57,307 --> 03:04:58,140
BECCA: And draw a new hand.

4890
03:04:58,140 --> 03:04:58,973
IVAN: Had a Two-Face.

4891
03:04:59,819 --> 03:05:01,614
IFY: It's time for me to draw.

4892
03:05:01,614 --> 03:05:03,168
IVAN: I have a hard time thinking that we're

4893
03:05:03,168 --> 03:05:05,327
gonna get anything out
of you in that mask.

4894
03:05:05,327 --> 03:05:06,981
IFY: Oh, you'll see.

4895
03:05:06,981 --> 03:05:08,538
BECCA: I'm sorry, what?

4896
03:05:08,538 --> 03:05:09,482
IFY: You'll see.

4897
03:05:09,482 --> 03:05:10,380
BECCA: What did he say?

4898
03:05:10,380 --> 03:05:11,731
IVAN: I think it's something about seals?

4899
03:05:11,731 --> 03:05:14,068
BECCA: Did you need help opening a seal?

4900
03:05:14,068 --> 03:05:17,304
IFY: I'll play the Batman, and
I will guess Becca again,

4901
03:05:17,304 --> 03:05:19,636
she has the Harley Quinn.

4902
03:05:19,636 --> 03:05:20,636
BECCA: Incorrect.

4903
03:05:22,312 --> 03:05:23,621
HECTOR: Geez, we're terrible at this game.

4904
03:05:23,621 --> 03:05:25,333
IVAN: We're really, really bad.

4905
03:05:25,333 --> 03:05:26,289
BECCA: I'm great at it.

4906
03:05:26,289 --> 03:05:28,854
IFY: Sooner or later.

4907
03:05:28,854 --> 03:05:30,984
IVAN: He's in there, or he's there.

4908
03:05:30,984 --> 03:05:32,521
Not there, there.

4909
03:05:32,521 --> 03:05:33,599
Not there, there.

4910
03:05:33,599 --> 03:05:34,449
BECCA: There?
IVAN: There.

4911
03:05:34,449 --> 03:05:35,282
BECCA: Where?

4912
03:05:35,282 --> 03:05:38,992
HECTOR: I'm going to play my own version of Bane.

4913
03:05:38,992 --> 03:05:40,748
That was terrible.

4914
03:05:40,748 --> 03:05:42,325
BECCA: You don't have the mask.

4915
03:05:42,325 --> 03:05:45,000
HECTOR: Myself and another player
can secretly compare hands,

4916
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,453
and whichever hand is lowest is out.

4917
03:05:47,453 --> 03:05:49,373
So I'm gunning for you, Poison Ivy.

4918
03:05:49,373 --> 03:05:50,550
Because you kissed me that one time,

4919
03:05:50,550 --> 03:05:53,362
and then you didn't wanna
hang out with me afterwards,

4920
03:05:53,362 --> 03:05:54,795
like that was really mean, so.

4921
03:05:54,795 --> 03:05:56,435
BECCA: I had ulterior motives.

4922
03:05:56,435 --> 03:06:00,002
IVAN: I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.

4923
03:06:00,002 --> 03:06:01,362
BECCA: I'm out of the game.

4924
03:06:01,362 --> 03:06:02,606
HECTOR: You're out, yes!

4925
03:06:02,606 --> 03:06:04,905
BECCA: I had myself again.

4926
03:06:04,905 --> 03:06:06,637
IVAN: Which means you have a
higher numbered card.

4927
03:06:06,637 --> 03:06:07,731
HECTOR: Yes, that is correct.

4928
03:06:07,731 --> 03:06:08,810
IVAN: Higher than five.

4929
03:06:08,810 --> 03:06:10,919
HECTOR: Good detective work, Batman.

4930
03:06:10,919 --> 03:06:13,428
Real genius, this one.

4931
03:06:13,428 --> 03:06:14,542
IVAN: All right.

4932
03:06:14,542 --> 03:06:16,008
This is the last card of the deck,

4933
03:06:16,008 --> 03:06:20,148
which means after this, whoever
has the highest card, wins.

4934
03:06:20,148 --> 03:06:22,105
HECTOR: Duh, Batman, we know, God.

4935
03:06:22,105 --> 03:06:24,215
IVAN: I'm playing Robin, Robin.

4936
03:06:24,215 --> 03:06:25,125
All right?

4937
03:06:25,125 --> 03:06:27,013
BECCA: That makes me think he has the Joker.

4938
03:06:27,013 --> 03:06:28,602
IVAN: Well, we'll find out won't we?

4939
03:06:28,602 --> 03:06:29,968
What do you got?

4940
03:06:29,968 --> 03:06:31,218
IFY: I had myself.

4941
03:06:32,389 --> 03:06:34,225
HECTOR: Boom, Harley Quinn beats Bane.

4942
03:06:34,225 --> 03:06:37,274
IVAN: And the Joker beats Harley Quinn.

4943
03:06:37,274 --> 03:06:38,133
HECTOR: Darn it.

4944
03:06:38,133 --> 03:06:39,822
IVAN: I got you, Joker.

4945
03:06:39,822 --> 03:06:41,059
BECCA: Take your token.

4946
03:06:41,059 --> 03:06:43,372
IVAN: I will take my narcissistic token

4947
03:06:43,372 --> 03:06:45,119
that has my symbol on it.

4948
03:06:45,119 --> 03:06:47,185
HECTOR: This is just what Batman
needed, an ego boost.

4949
03:06:47,185 --> 03:06:49,766
Batman needed an ego boost, great.

4950
03:06:49,766 --> 03:06:50,754
IFY: Robin.

4951
03:06:50,754 --> 03:06:52,527
BECCA: The deb chef, the deb chef.

4952
03:06:52,527 --> 03:06:54,791
HECTOR: You seem to live with a multi billionaire,

4953
03:06:54,791 --> 03:06:57,130
yet can't afford contacts.

4954
03:06:57,130 --> 03:06:58,898
What's the deal with that?

4955
03:06:58,898 --> 03:07:00,648
BECCA: No burn card, no burn card.

4956
03:07:00,648 --> 03:07:01,481
IVAN: Oh, great.

4957
03:07:01,481 --> 03:07:04,802
So since I won the last
round, I get to play first,

4958
03:07:04,802 --> 03:07:07,102
because I am the greatest detective.

4959
03:07:07,102 --> 03:07:09,439
And I got a Catwoman,

4960
03:07:09,439 --> 03:07:13,321
which means I think I'm
interested in Bane's hand.

4961
03:07:13,321 --> 03:07:14,906
Whatcha got, Bane?

4962
03:07:14,906 --> 03:07:17,392
You got crap, is what he's got.

4963
03:07:17,392 --> 03:07:19,471
BECCA: Choose any player including yourself

4964
03:07:19,471 --> 03:07:22,597
to discard his or her
hand and draw a new card.

4965
03:07:22,597 --> 03:07:24,011
Hector, burn your card.

4966
03:07:24,011 --> 03:07:25,322
HECTOR: You got it, but it's Robin,

4967
03:07:25,322 --> 03:07:26,918
and I'm not gonna tell you again.

4968
03:07:26,918 --> 03:07:30,270
All right, I had Batman, which is cool,

4969
03:07:30,270 --> 03:07:32,850
because he's the least
value card in the game,

4970
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:33,810
so that's just gonna help me out,

4971
03:07:33,810 --> 03:07:35,561
so I'm just gonna grab a new card.

4972
03:07:35,561 --> 03:07:37,679
IFY: All right, I'm going to draw.

4973
03:07:37,679 --> 03:07:38,679
Draw a card.

4974
03:07:39,525 --> 03:07:42,311
Oof, oof, oof, such a good card.

4975
03:07:42,311 --> 03:07:45,363
IVAN: Who are you gonna use it on, Bane?

4976
03:07:45,363 --> 03:07:46,743
BECCA: It's probably Batman.

4977
03:07:46,743 --> 03:07:49,645
IFY: I'm gonna do a Batman card.

4978
03:07:49,645 --> 03:07:51,572
Robin, do you have Poison Ivy?

4979
03:07:51,572 --> 03:07:54,155
HECTOR: (laughs) No.

4980
03:07:55,468 --> 03:07:57,249
IFY: My turn is over.

4981
03:07:57,249 --> 03:07:59,768
HECTOR: All right, it's my turn.

4982
03:07:59,768 --> 03:08:01,798
Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Tim Drake,

4983
03:08:01,798 --> 03:08:05,199
Stephanie Brown, Carrie
Kelley, John Blake, help me.

4984
03:08:05,199 --> 03:08:06,611
Okay, here we go.

4985
03:08:06,611 --> 03:08:09,459
My girl Selina Kyle, Catwoman, bam.

4986
03:08:09,459 --> 03:08:12,126
And I wanna look at Bane's hand.

4987
03:08:13,033 --> 03:08:14,419
Show me back here buddy,
show me back here,

4988
03:08:14,419 --> 03:08:15,365
whatcha got?

4989
03:08:15,365 --> 03:08:16,234
IFY: Got this.

4990
03:08:16,234 --> 03:08:17,391
HECTOR: Okay, good to know.

4991
03:08:17,391 --> 03:08:18,487
IVAN: All right.

4992
03:08:18,487 --> 03:08:22,145
I'm going to just play my ward Robin.

4993
03:08:22,145 --> 03:08:23,046
HECTOR: You're welcome.

4994
03:08:23,046 --> 03:08:24,713
IVAN: Grant me immunity.

4995
03:08:27,706 --> 03:08:28,830
BECCA: Batman.

4996
03:08:28,830 --> 03:08:31,678
I'm gonna guess that Bane has Poison Ivy.

4997
03:08:31,678 --> 03:08:32,928
IFY: You're wrong!

4998
03:08:34,063 --> 03:08:36,646
BECCA: You'll never have Poison Ivy.

4999
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:39,167
IFY: I'll use Catwoman.

5000
03:08:40,256 --> 03:08:42,651
BECCA: To look at another player's hands.

5001
03:08:42,651 --> 03:08:44,151
HECTOR: Pause for error.

5002
03:08:45,777 --> 03:08:47,994
IFY: I will look at

5003
03:08:47,994 --> 03:08:49,494
Poison Ivy's hand.

5004
03:08:51,026 --> 03:08:54,583
HECTOR: Don't do it Bane, don't fall
into that venus fly trap.

5005
03:08:54,583 --> 03:08:56,586
Get it, 'cause it's a trap, 'cause it's.

5006
03:08:56,586 --> 03:08:57,419
It's a plant based pun.

5007
03:08:57,419 --> 03:08:58,336
IVAN: Good job.

5008
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:01,091
IFY: Ah.

5009
03:09:01,091 --> 03:09:01,924
IVAN: There it is.

5010
03:09:01,924 --> 03:09:03,183
IFY: Ah.

5011
03:09:03,183 --> 03:09:04,016
Ah!

5012
03:09:05,228 --> 03:09:07,380
IVAN: Robin, Robin go ahead.

5013
03:09:07,380 --> 03:09:09,672
HECTOR: Okay, here we go.

5014
03:09:09,672 --> 03:09:10,856
IVAN: What's it gonna be?

5015
03:09:10,856 --> 03:09:13,426
HECTOR: I'm gonna play Batman.

5016
03:09:13,426 --> 03:09:15,960
And I'm gonna guess that Bane

5017
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:17,460
Has a Batman card.

5018
03:09:18,547 --> 03:09:20,019
IFY: You are wrong.

5019
03:09:20,019 --> 03:09:22,520
IVAN: For once he doesn't have a Batman card.

5020
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:25,687
IFY: I want to point out to the watchers.

5021
03:09:27,009 --> 03:09:29,414
Hector looked at my hand.

5022
03:09:29,414 --> 03:09:30,595
HECTOR: Oh I did, that's true.

5023
03:09:30,595 --> 03:09:33,161
IFY: And saw me play the card.

5024
03:09:33,161 --> 03:09:36,661
He knew exactly which card was in my hand.

5025
03:09:37,722 --> 03:09:39,805
And chose the wrong card.

5026
03:09:40,842 --> 03:09:44,682
IVAN: This is why you're the boy
wonder, and not Batman.

5027
03:09:44,682 --> 03:09:45,772
HECTOR: I'd like to point out,

5028
03:09:45,772 --> 03:09:48,454
that my chest has made
me very uncomfortable,

5029
03:09:48,454 --> 03:09:50,602
and I'm clearly out of my element,

5030
03:09:50,602 --> 03:09:52,779
and dressing me up as Robin
was a good call everybody,

5031
03:09:52,779 --> 03:09:54,259
good call everyone.

5032
03:09:54,259 --> 03:09:56,096
Good call guys.

5033
03:09:56,096 --> 03:09:56,929
Wow.

5034
03:09:56,929 --> 03:09:59,829
IFY: I really thought that
was game over for me.

5035
03:09:59,829 --> 03:10:01,420
I was wrong.

5036
03:10:02,684 --> 03:10:04,055
HECTOR: Oh my God.

5037
03:10:04,055 --> 03:10:08,222
Your annoying voice has
really gotten into my head.

5038
03:10:09,569 --> 03:10:11,902
BECCA: That's his greatest power.

5039
03:10:13,207 --> 03:10:15,203
IVAN: I also have the Batman.

5040
03:10:15,203 --> 03:10:18,844
So we know he doesn't have a
Batman, you know what it is.

5041
03:10:18,844 --> 03:10:20,107
Thanks Robin.

5042
03:10:20,107 --> 03:10:21,137
Useless.

5043
03:10:21,137 --> 03:10:24,970
So I'm gonna guess that
Bane has Harley Quinn.

5044
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:28,840
IFY: You are wrong!

5045
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:30,067
IVAN: Damn.

5046
03:10:30,067 --> 03:10:30,917
I tried.

5047
03:10:30,917 --> 03:10:35,711
All the clues are there,
just one missing element.

5048
03:10:35,711 --> 03:10:39,310
BECCA: I played Batman, I'm going
to guess that Bane has

5049
03:10:39,310 --> 03:10:40,624
Two-Face.

5050
03:10:40,624 --> 03:10:43,431
IFY: You are wrong as well.

5051
03:10:43,431 --> 03:10:46,089
IVAN: He has the Joker then, or something.

5052
03:10:46,089 --> 03:10:49,384
How can you throw that many
Batmans at a single man,

5053
03:10:49,384 --> 03:10:51,060
and not get what he's got in his hand.

5054
03:10:51,060 --> 03:10:52,780
HECTOR: He really did break you, he really did.

5055
03:10:57,164 --> 03:10:59,342
And now I'm Nightwing, great,
that's how long that took.

5056
03:10:59,342 --> 03:11:00,925
IFY: I'm going to say.

5057
03:11:01,954 --> 03:11:05,378
Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.

5058
03:11:05,378 --> 03:11:07,378
BECCA: (sighs)

5059
03:11:08,471 --> 03:11:10,304
IVAN: That's where it was.

5060
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:13,710
Robin?

5061
03:11:13,710 --> 03:11:14,960
HECTOR: It's my turn.

5062
03:11:16,478 --> 03:11:17,895
IVAN: Diddly fingers.

5063
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:20,500
HECTOR: You guys think you're gonna win this?

5064
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:21,795
You don't know Dick.

5065
03:11:21,795 --> 03:11:23,780
Greyson, because that's my real name.

5066
03:11:23,780 --> 03:11:25,619
I'm gonna play

5067
03:11:25,619 --> 03:11:26,507
Bane.

5068
03:11:26,507 --> 03:11:27,533
BECCA: Bane-in it up.

5069
03:11:27,533 --> 03:11:30,089
IVAN: What's up, who's gonna compare?

5070
03:11:30,089 --> 03:11:32,564
HECTOR: It's gonna be you, Batman.

5071
03:11:32,564 --> 03:11:33,863
Let's see what you got, old chum.

5072
03:11:33,863 --> 03:11:35,483
Oh hoh, bye, you're out.

5073
03:11:35,483 --> 03:11:36,690
(laughs)

5074
03:11:36,690 --> 03:11:38,190
IVAN: Batman card, so.

5075
03:11:39,350 --> 03:11:40,198
Batman's out.

5076
03:11:40,198 --> 03:11:41,977
BECCA: Batman's the worst.

5077
03:11:41,977 --> 03:11:42,810
HECTOR: Oh my gosh.

5078
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:45,157
IVAN: How's it feel to knock a
man down from his tower?

5079
03:11:45,157 --> 03:11:45,990
HECTOR: It feels great.

5080
03:11:45,990 --> 03:11:46,823
IVAN: Right, okay.

5081
03:11:46,823 --> 03:11:47,656
HECTOR: How's it feel for not giving me--

5082
03:11:47,656 --> 03:11:50,144
MARISHA: Great for my back.

5083
03:11:50,144 --> 03:11:50,977
ZAC: We're live.

5084
03:11:50,977 --> 03:11:52,014
MATT: What's up everyone,

5085
03:11:52,014 --> 03:11:53,994
we got this camera right
here in the middle, right?

5086
03:11:53,994 --> 03:11:55,121
ASHLEY: Hello.

5087
03:11:55,121 --> 03:11:55,954
LIAM: Oh, hi.

5088
03:11:55,954 --> 03:11:57,403
MATT: Thank you guys for watching.

5089
03:11:57,403 --> 03:11:58,743
Hope you enjoyed yourselves.

5090
03:11:58,743 --> 03:12:01,039
These guys all being crazy players,

5091
03:12:01,039 --> 03:12:02,579
and kicking ass,

5092
03:12:02,579 --> 03:12:04,215
and occasionally getting
knocked unconscious,

5093
03:12:04,215 --> 03:12:05,048
and nearly eaten.

5094
03:12:05,048 --> 03:12:06,490
ZAC: Any mods want to put this in sub mode for us?

5095
03:12:06,490 --> 03:12:08,092
Let's do sub mode.

5096
03:12:08,092 --> 03:12:10,240
MARISHA: So you have to sub.

5097
03:12:10,240 --> 03:12:12,083
Bye everybody who's not a sub.

5098
03:12:12,083 --> 03:12:13,151
ASHLEY: Bye!

5099
03:12:13,151 --> 03:12:13,984
ZAC: They can still watch,

5100
03:12:13,984 --> 03:12:14,817
they just can't ask questions.

5101
03:12:14,817 --> 03:12:15,650
ORION: Oh.

5102
03:12:15,650 --> 03:12:16,483
Okay.

5103
03:12:16,483 --> 03:12:19,198
MARISHA: Well, your word is not important.

5104
03:12:19,198 --> 03:12:21,625
LIAM: Laura had to bugger out.

5105
03:12:21,625 --> 03:12:23,749
ASHLEY: Wait, is that a little icon of you?

5106
03:12:23,749 --> 03:12:24,582
MATT: Yeah.

5107
03:12:24,582 --> 03:12:25,466
ASHLEY: What?

5108
03:12:25,466 --> 03:12:26,749
ORION: Yeah, he's an emoji now.

5109
03:12:26,749 --> 03:12:27,759
ASHLEY: You're an emoji?

5110
03:12:27,759 --> 03:12:28,592
MATT: It's weird.

5111
03:12:28,592 --> 03:12:29,425
TALIESIN: He's made it.

5112
03:12:29,425 --> 03:12:30,634
ASHLEY: You've made it.

5113
03:12:32,651 --> 03:12:33,875
MATT: All right, so how are we
doing the questions?

5114
03:12:33,875 --> 03:12:35,165
Are we just picking as we go?

5115
03:12:35,165 --> 03:12:37,211
ZAC: You can moderate yourselves.

5116
03:12:37,211 --> 03:12:39,918
ASHLEY: Laura and Sam did leave.

5117
03:12:39,918 --> 03:12:41,058
MATT: Unfortunately.

5118
03:12:41,058 --> 03:12:44,759
ASHLEY: Laura had to go to a thing,
and Sam had to go to a thing.

5119
03:12:44,759 --> 03:12:46,528
MATT: Sam's thing is kids.

5120
03:12:46,528 --> 03:12:48,291
Sam has two kids.

5121
03:12:48,291 --> 03:12:49,440
Liam has two kids, but he--

5122
03:12:49,440 --> 03:12:50,273
ASHLEY: Hey look at--

5123
03:12:51,458 --> 03:12:53,708
(all laugh)

5124
03:12:54,655 --> 03:12:55,966
MATT: I am so sorry, everyone.

5125
03:12:55,966 --> 03:12:58,719
LIAM: I mean he's pretty good at
Dungeon Mastering, right?

5126
03:12:58,719 --> 03:13:00,306
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's pretty good.

5127
03:13:00,306 --> 03:13:02,375
ORION: Someone asked what alignment we are.

5128
03:13:02,375 --> 03:13:04,996
First question, what
alignment are our characters?

5129
03:13:04,996 --> 03:13:06,012
MARISHA: We're all good.

5130
03:13:06,012 --> 03:13:06,999
LIAM: Chaotic good.

5131
03:13:06,999 --> 03:13:07,832
ASHLEY: Chaotic good.

5132
03:13:07,832 --> 03:13:09,764
ORION: Tiberius is chaotic good.

5133
03:13:09,764 --> 03:13:11,510
TRAVIS: Chaotic neutral, bitches.

5134
03:13:11,510 --> 03:13:13,044
LIAM: What was your first
roleplaying experience?

5135
03:13:13,044 --> 03:13:15,266
I saw that go through.

5136
03:13:15,266 --> 03:13:16,955
TALIESIN: GURPS in high school.

5137
03:13:16,955 --> 03:13:18,122
ALL: GURPS.

5138
03:13:18,973 --> 03:13:22,664
MATT: The second edition of Dungeons
&amp; Dragons in high school.

5139
03:13:22,664 --> 03:13:23,497
TRAVIS: This.

5140
03:13:23,497 --> 03:13:24,782
ASHLEY: Was my first, yeah.

5141
03:13:24,782 --> 03:13:26,202
LIAM: This guy just started.

5142
03:13:26,202 --> 03:13:28,184
I did AD&amp;D in high school,

5143
03:13:28,184 --> 03:13:31,347
and I DM'ed while playing,
which is totally cheating.

5144
03:13:31,347 --> 03:13:35,267
This is the first pure
experience I've had.

5145
03:13:35,267 --> 03:13:38,017
ORION: This is my first campaign also.

5146
03:13:39,156 --> 03:13:41,139
I was a Magic the Gathering fan.

5147
03:13:41,139 --> 03:13:45,899
MARISHA: I actually had Matt as my
first DM, way before

5148
03:13:45,899 --> 03:13:47,490
All this started.

5149
03:13:47,490 --> 03:13:49,810
So I played a few other games, and then,

5150
03:13:49,810 --> 03:13:52,384
now I'm back to the OG master.

5151
03:13:52,384 --> 03:13:55,938
LIAM: I saw, when and how did you
all start playing together?

5152
03:13:55,938 --> 03:13:58,452
The reason this started is because,

5153
03:13:58,452 --> 03:14:01,898
I directed Matt as Leon
Kennedy in Resident Evil 6,

5154
03:14:01,898 --> 03:14:04,159
and every time he came in he would say,

5155
03:14:04,159 --> 03:14:06,533
"hey, you know, I'm running a game,

5156
03:14:06,533 --> 03:14:08,055
"you can come in and just do a one off."

5157
03:14:08,055 --> 03:14:09,072
And I was like, "oh, I got babies,

5158
03:14:09,072 --> 03:14:12,129
"I can't do that, I can't
do that, I can't do that."

5159
03:14:12,129 --> 03:14:15,341
And then finally once for
my birthday I thought,

5160
03:14:15,341 --> 03:14:17,277
I can do a one off, it'll be
the only time we'll do it,

5161
03:14:17,277 --> 03:14:18,833
just see how it goes.

5162
03:14:18,833 --> 03:14:22,096
Scanlan and I did a podcast together,

5163
03:14:22,096 --> 03:14:24,140
and every week we would do some new thing,

5164
03:14:24,140 --> 03:14:26,743
and we're like fuck it, let's play D&amp;D.

5165
03:14:26,743 --> 03:14:29,043
We all did it and everybody got snake bit,

5166
03:14:29,043 --> 03:14:31,532
and it's been the best
thing that ever happened.

5167
03:14:31,532 --> 03:14:32,365
To me at least.

5168
03:14:32,365 --> 03:14:33,749
ASHLEY: Yup.

5169
03:14:33,749 --> 03:14:36,114
ORION: Our character alignments do matter

5170
03:14:36,114 --> 03:14:38,676
on how we play the characters,
an earlier question.

5171
03:14:38,676 --> 03:14:40,216
MATT: Yeah, they do definitely matter.

5172
03:14:40,216 --> 03:14:42,281
A couple quick answers here.

5173
03:14:42,281 --> 03:14:45,297
The conversion from
Pathfinder to Fifth Edition

5174
03:14:45,297 --> 03:14:47,929
was decided because, as
we're going on to this show,

5175
03:14:47,929 --> 03:14:50,730
and we had so many players,
combat tends to get bogged down,

5176
03:14:50,730 --> 03:14:52,544
and a lot of floating
modifiers in Pathfinder.

5177
03:14:52,544 --> 03:14:53,854
For large groups like this it's difficult

5178
03:14:53,854 --> 03:14:55,398
to keep it flowing and moving.

5179
03:14:55,398 --> 03:14:56,761
I felt once I had taken
a look at Fifth Edition,

5180
03:14:56,761 --> 03:14:58,696
that the combat system was
a little more simplified,

5181
03:14:58,696 --> 03:15:01,642
and a little easier to make
freeform and just roll with it.

5182
03:15:01,642 --> 03:15:03,942
So that was a much better decision.

5183
03:15:03,942 --> 03:15:06,026
Plus Dungeons &amp; Dragons
generally has a better

5184
03:15:06,026 --> 03:15:07,595
name recognition than Pathfinder,

5185
03:15:07,595 --> 03:15:09,189
so when you're putting a show out there,

5186
03:15:09,189 --> 03:15:11,794
it's probably easier to do
with very minimal transition,

5187
03:15:11,794 --> 03:15:12,989
it took a little bit of customizing,

5188
03:15:12,989 --> 03:15:15,682
like for Percy's gunslinger.

5189
03:15:15,682 --> 03:15:17,203
We just had to customize
it, we made it ourselves.

5190
03:15:17,203 --> 03:15:18,069
We sat down.

5191
03:15:18,069 --> 03:15:18,902
TALIESIN: Took a day.

5192
03:15:18,902 --> 03:15:20,259
MATT: Took a day, and we worked out,

5193
03:15:20,259 --> 03:15:21,092
some of the stuff we wanted to keep,

5194
03:15:21,092 --> 03:15:22,163
some of the things that didn't break it,

5195
03:15:22,163 --> 03:15:23,309
we wanted to make it interesting.

5196
03:15:23,309 --> 03:15:26,759
It is a martial archetype
for the fighter class.

5197
03:15:26,759 --> 03:15:30,250
So it does give the bonus
a fighter class does.

5198
03:15:30,250 --> 03:15:31,456
Nothing is too overpowered about it,

5199
03:15:31,456 --> 03:15:33,281
other than just having custom weapons,

5200
03:15:33,281 --> 03:15:34,815
and some cool grit-based abilities

5201
03:15:34,815 --> 03:15:37,419
that we kinda transferred
over from Pathfinder.

5202
03:15:37,419 --> 03:15:38,252
It's interesting.

5203
03:15:38,252 --> 03:15:41,592
It's a good challenge
to see how it works out.

5204
03:15:41,592 --> 03:15:42,509
TALIESIN: It is, it's working out.

5205
03:15:42,509 --> 03:15:43,421
I'm digging it.

5206
03:15:43,421 --> 03:15:45,713
I keep reading and finding
things I'm not doing

5207
03:15:45,713 --> 03:15:47,856
that could be more interesting, so.

5208
03:15:47,856 --> 03:15:49,633
MATT: Keeping your hand and
firing into the mouth

5209
03:15:49,633 --> 03:15:50,973
of a bulette is fun.

5210
03:15:50,973 --> 03:15:52,705
TALIESIN: That felt great.

5211
03:15:52,705 --> 03:15:56,164
LIAM: Travis, everybody's
asking about your shirt.

5212
03:15:56,164 --> 03:15:57,442
TRAVIS: Oh.

5213
03:15:57,442 --> 03:16:00,677
I think it's a website
called redbubble.com?

5214
03:16:00,677 --> 03:16:03,064
I just googled Grog, and there was that.

5215
03:16:03,064 --> 03:16:04,934
TALIESIN: Just google Grog.

5216
03:16:04,934 --> 03:16:06,641
TRAVIS: I needed it right away.

5217
03:16:09,458 --> 03:16:10,471
Right, right.

5218
03:16:10,471 --> 03:16:12,139
LIAM: I'm also seeing, why did we switch

5219
03:16:12,139 --> 03:16:14,326
from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition?

5220
03:16:14,326 --> 03:16:16,072
MATT: I answered that a second ago.

5221
03:16:16,072 --> 03:16:16,905
LIAM: Oh, you did?

5222
03:16:16,905 --> 03:16:18,054
MATT: Yeah, the idea being that
the reason we switched

5223
03:16:18,054 --> 03:16:19,657
was it was easier for large-scale combat,

5224
03:16:19,657 --> 03:16:21,610
and the system was a
little more simplified,

5225
03:16:21,610 --> 03:16:24,664
and I felt for such a large
party it'd be easier to do.

5226
03:16:24,664 --> 03:16:26,188
Plus character creation
for any guests we have

5227
03:16:26,188 --> 03:16:28,237
in the future, so that
was the main reason.

5228
03:16:28,237 --> 03:16:30,676
I love Pathfinder, but
at this size, it's good.

5229
03:16:30,676 --> 03:16:31,829
Answering your earlier question too,

5230
03:16:31,829 --> 03:16:33,842
I saw someone ask, a good party size.

5231
03:16:33,842 --> 03:16:38,616
Legitimately, my preference is
between four and six players.

5232
03:16:38,616 --> 03:16:41,070
This works because
they're amazing players,

5233
03:16:41,070 --> 03:16:43,255
and because we keep it very freeform,

5234
03:16:43,255 --> 03:16:46,150
and not getting bogged
down in minutia too often.

5235
03:16:46,150 --> 03:16:50,112
The four to six players I
think is a good sweet spot.

5236
03:16:50,112 --> 03:16:52,006
MARISHA: I see, does Keyleth have limitations

5237
03:16:52,006 --> 03:16:54,612
on what animals she can transform into?

5238
03:16:54,612 --> 03:16:56,214
Yeah, for the most part
I can only transform

5239
03:16:56,214 --> 03:16:58,220
into beasts and I have to be under

5240
03:16:58,220 --> 03:17:00,138
a certain challenge rating.

5241
03:17:00,138 --> 03:17:02,496
So right now, at my level, I
can only turn into beasts

5242
03:17:02,496 --> 03:17:05,281
that are a challenge
reading of three or lower.

5243
03:17:05,281 --> 03:17:06,380
MATT: A third of your druid level, right?

5244
03:17:06,380 --> 03:17:10,355
MARISHA: Yeah, a third of my druid
level which is nine right now.

5245
03:17:10,355 --> 03:17:12,745
But for the most part I can change into

5246
03:17:12,745 --> 03:17:15,768
almost anything as long as
it's under a challenge rating

5247
03:17:15,768 --> 03:17:17,183
of three.

5248
03:17:17,183 --> 03:17:18,423
MATT: Pike, how do you feel about Scanlan?

5249
03:17:18,423 --> 03:17:19,580
Do you return his affections?

5250
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:20,762
ASHLEY: Oh, well.

5251
03:17:20,762 --> 03:17:22,742
I'm on the fence about him.

5252
03:17:24,978 --> 03:17:27,516
He's really pretty
great, but I don't know.

5253
03:17:27,516 --> 03:17:28,874
I'm not really sold yet.

5254
03:17:28,874 --> 03:17:30,243
MARISHA: You know Pike, I feel
like we haven't actually

5255
03:17:30,243 --> 03:17:31,538
girl talked about this.

5256
03:17:31,538 --> 03:17:32,991
ASHLEY: I know, we never girl talked about it.

5257
03:17:32,991 --> 03:17:33,824
MARISHA: We should.

5258
03:17:33,824 --> 03:17:34,657
ASHLEY: I know, we should talk.

5259
03:17:34,657 --> 03:17:38,638
I just, I really like him,
I think he's really funny.

5260
03:17:38,638 --> 03:17:42,275
I really the fact that
he's a musician, but.

5261
03:17:42,275 --> 03:17:43,108
MARISHA: That's hot.

5262
03:17:43,108 --> 03:17:45,230
ASHLEY: I don't know, I'm not
really sold on him yet.

5263
03:17:45,230 --> 03:17:47,001
MARISHA: I'm just concerned if
he could treat you well.

5264
03:17:47,001 --> 03:17:48,753
ASHLEY: Oh no, you know what?

5265
03:17:48,753 --> 03:17:50,586
MARISHA: He's got bad habits.

5266
03:17:51,873 --> 03:17:54,238
ASHLEY: He likes to frequent brothels
and things like that,

5267
03:17:54,238 --> 03:17:55,571
which, you know.

5268
03:17:56,406 --> 03:17:58,156
I'd wanna give him his
freedom and his space.

5269
03:17:58,156 --> 03:18:00,912
I don't know if I'm into it.

5270
03:18:00,912 --> 03:18:02,344
TALIESIN: If I say it so you can understand it,

5271
03:18:02,344 --> 03:18:03,256
what's the point?

5272
03:18:05,474 --> 03:18:07,185
LIAM: Someone's asking if we like presents.

5273
03:18:07,185 --> 03:18:09,754
I think we'd all like fan art.

5274
03:18:09,754 --> 03:18:12,372
MATT: Fan art's awesome, we love it.

5275
03:18:12,372 --> 03:18:15,899
LIAM: Immortalize our
shitheadedness, that'd be good.

5276
03:18:15,899 --> 03:18:16,846
MARISHA: Oh, it's true.

5277
03:18:16,846 --> 03:18:18,657
ASHLEY: Another couple people on there

5278
03:18:18,657 --> 03:18:20,600
were asking about my ears.

5279
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:23,389
And I really like
supporting small businesses.

5280
03:18:23,389 --> 03:18:28,179
And there's a store on Etsy
called Tiny Tangerines,

5281
03:18:28,179 --> 03:18:30,953
and she makes these by hand.

5282
03:18:30,953 --> 03:18:34,369
And makes like deer, and bears,

5283
03:18:34,369 --> 03:18:35,364
she makes a ton of stuff.

5284
03:18:35,364 --> 03:18:36,796
MATT: That's really cute.

5285
03:18:36,796 --> 03:18:38,129
ASHLEY: Check her out.

5286
03:18:39,314 --> 03:18:40,868
LIAM: We still got that little one.

5287
03:18:40,868 --> 03:18:43,202
Socrates asked what was a favorite moment

5288
03:18:43,202 --> 03:18:46,170
before we started streaming the show?

5289
03:18:46,170 --> 03:18:49,183
Our first game was pretty amazing.

5290
03:18:49,183 --> 03:18:50,266
MARISHA: Our first game was great,

5291
03:18:50,266 --> 03:18:54,152
I've got some good memories from that one.

5292
03:18:54,152 --> 03:18:57,636
LIAM: Most of us, I was giggling uncontrollably,

5293
03:18:57,636 --> 03:18:59,605
I couldn't believe we were doing it.

5294
03:18:59,605 --> 03:19:02,216
And just watching my friends,
who I work with all the time,

5295
03:19:02,216 --> 03:19:04,473
just dropping into
character, there was no like,

5296
03:19:04,473 --> 03:19:06,557
oh, let's see, what will
I do, what am I doing?

5297
03:19:06,557 --> 03:19:08,282
I will move, I will roll.

5298
03:19:08,282 --> 03:19:11,874
Like Bailey, Bailey dropped
into character from the get-go,

5299
03:19:11,874 --> 03:19:13,291
and was a ringer.

5300
03:19:14,255 --> 03:19:16,894
But the moment I was thinking
of was when Pike died.

5301
03:19:16,894 --> 03:19:17,835
Pike died.

5302
03:19:17,835 --> 03:19:18,668
MATT: Like died died.

5303
03:19:18,668 --> 03:19:23,153
LIAM: Shortly before we switched
from private to public.

5304
03:19:23,153 --> 03:19:24,326
It was emotional.

5305
03:19:24,326 --> 03:19:26,903
A couple people started
crying, I teared up.

5306
03:19:26,903 --> 03:19:29,652
We put two and a half years into this,

5307
03:19:29,652 --> 03:19:31,872
and we're all very connected to it.

5308
03:19:31,872 --> 03:19:33,319
I'm not gonna get into it,

5309
03:19:33,319 --> 03:19:35,799
but I've had a hard couple
of years personally,

5310
03:19:35,799 --> 03:19:38,482
everything's fine, but this
was like therapy for me.

5311
03:19:38,482 --> 03:19:41,285
And to see one of my friends go down?

5312
03:19:41,285 --> 03:19:42,446
ASHLEY: It was sad.

5313
03:19:42,446 --> 03:19:43,382
LIAM: It was fucking emotional.

5314
03:19:43,382 --> 03:19:44,732
MARISHA: I don't think a few people were crying,

5315
03:19:44,732 --> 03:19:46,192
I think everyone was crying.

5316
03:19:46,192 --> 03:19:47,025
ORION: I was crying.

5317
03:19:47,025 --> 03:19:48,505
ASHLEY: I was definitely crying.

5318
03:19:48,505 --> 03:19:50,597
I was like, "no, I love
doing this so much!"

5319
03:19:50,597 --> 03:19:52,147
I don't wanna, I mean,

5320
03:19:52,147 --> 03:19:53,754
when you spend that much time with people,

5321
03:19:53,754 --> 03:19:56,106
over two and a half years,
you get so attached,

5322
03:19:56,106 --> 03:19:57,823
and attached to characters.

5323
03:19:57,823 --> 03:19:59,662
MARISHA: We know these characters almost as well

5324
03:19:59,662 --> 03:20:01,601
as we know each other now.

5325
03:20:01,601 --> 03:20:04,390
MATT: Factoids, the tower you made for us

5326
03:20:04,390 --> 03:20:06,150
in Minecraft is awesome.

5327
03:20:06,150 --> 03:20:08,003
Seriously, well done,
look at the pictures,

5328
03:20:08,003 --> 03:20:09,591
it's great, we're gonna have
to actually go through it.

5329
03:20:09,591 --> 03:20:10,554
MARISHA: Wait, we have a tower?

5330
03:20:10,554 --> 03:20:12,770
MATT: A guy built an entire tower for the group.

5331
03:20:12,770 --> 03:20:13,686
ASHLEY: No way!

5332
03:20:13,686 --> 03:20:15,910
MARISHA: They built a castle Greyskull?

5333
03:20:15,910 --> 03:20:19,417
MATT: Essentially, on the Geek
&amp; Sundry Minecraft server.

5334
03:20:21,787 --> 03:20:22,709
No.

5335
03:20:22,709 --> 03:20:23,945
Wait no I did see that!

5336
03:20:23,945 --> 03:20:24,778
It was huge.

5337
03:20:24,778 --> 03:20:26,155
ZAC: It towers over the entire --

5338
03:20:26,155 --> 03:20:26,988
LIAM: Of what?

5339
03:20:26,988 --> 03:20:28,023
MATT: Of him!

5340
03:20:28,023 --> 03:20:29,906
Someone made a sculpture of--.

5341
03:20:29,906 --> 03:20:31,860
Did you make that or somebody else?

5342
03:20:31,860 --> 03:20:32,761
You made that?

5343
03:20:32,761 --> 03:20:33,594
ZAC: Oh no.

5344
03:20:33,594 --> 03:20:36,099
MATT: Okay, somebody else made it for you.

5345
03:20:36,099 --> 03:20:37,804
LIAM: Do we have $50 in the budget

5346
03:20:37,804 --> 03:20:40,881
to go on eBay and get a
Castle of Greyskull set?

5347
03:20:40,881 --> 03:20:42,037
Put it on the set somewhere?

5348
03:20:42,037 --> 03:20:43,204
Let's do that.

5349
03:20:44,328 --> 03:20:45,257
MATT: There we go.

5350
03:20:45,257 --> 03:20:47,224
I see a couple quick questions.

5351
03:20:47,224 --> 03:20:48,391
ORION: To answer your question,

5352
03:20:48,391 --> 03:20:52,224
there is an origin of
Tiberius, fully written.

5353
03:20:53,156 --> 03:20:54,351
I won't say it all right now,

5354
03:20:54,351 --> 03:20:56,601
but he comes from a political family,

5355
03:20:56,601 --> 03:20:58,718
and there's a whole
bunch of layers to him.

5356
03:20:58,718 --> 03:21:01,218
He is a thought-out character.

5357
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:05,323
The buffoonery is half-planned.

5358
03:21:07,258 --> 03:21:10,866
MARISHA: I mean, we're all really
deep, thought out characters.

5359
03:21:10,866 --> 03:21:13,241
ORION: Well, they asked if I actually thought out

5360
03:21:13,241 --> 03:21:14,357
a story for him.

5361
03:21:14,357 --> 03:21:18,033
He does have a thing for
this character named Allura.

5362
03:21:18,033 --> 03:21:19,119
MATT: Yeah, Arcanist Allura,

5363
03:21:19,119 --> 03:21:21,266
the one that actually
sent them on this mission,

5364
03:21:21,266 --> 03:21:22,859
he has kind of a thing for.

5365
03:21:22,859 --> 03:21:23,906
ORION: She's super awesome.

5366
03:21:23,906 --> 03:21:25,682
Hot, I think she's hot.

5367
03:21:25,682 --> 03:21:26,597
MATT: She's pretty hot.

5368
03:21:26,597 --> 03:21:27,597
ASHLEY: Super hot.

5369
03:21:29,944 --> 03:21:31,004
MATT: The gunslinger class info,

5370
03:21:31,004 --> 03:21:33,692
I actually posted on
Twitter a few days ago,

5371
03:21:33,692 --> 03:21:36,141
it's in my dropbox if you
look through my Twitter.

5372
03:21:36,141 --> 03:21:37,061
It's on there, otherwise,

5373
03:21:37,061 --> 03:21:38,179
we'll probably put it up on the website,

5374
03:21:38,179 --> 03:21:39,409
when all the website stuff is up there.

5375
03:21:39,409 --> 03:21:41,530
I'm happy to release it now.

5376
03:21:41,530 --> 03:21:43,699
It's pretty balanced, it's fun.

5377
03:21:43,699 --> 03:21:44,802
Might have some tweaks down the road,

5378
03:21:44,802 --> 03:21:46,470
depending on how things play out.

5379
03:21:46,470 --> 03:21:48,163
You should go to my Twitter,
you'll find it there.

5380
03:21:48,163 --> 03:21:50,365
TRAVIS: We're gonna have a website
with all our characters.

5381
03:21:50,365 --> 03:21:51,698
LIAM: Yeah, we're working towards that.

5382
03:21:51,698 --> 03:21:52,961
MATT: Working on it, yeah.

5383
03:21:52,961 --> 03:21:55,354
Like a lot of things right
now, it's a work in progress.

5384
03:21:56,618 --> 03:22:00,072
LIAM: Someone asked what kind of
food would everyone like?

5385
03:22:00,072 --> 03:22:01,115
ORION: Ooh, like Thai food.

5386
03:22:01,115 --> 03:22:01,948
LIAM: I like Indian.

5387
03:22:01,948 --> 03:22:03,204
MATT: Ooh, Indian is good.

5388
03:22:03,204 --> 03:22:04,430
ASHLEY: I really noticed--

5389
03:22:04,430 --> 03:22:05,996
ZAC: Let them know not to order food.

5390
03:22:05,996 --> 03:22:08,429
LIAM: Don't, that's a terrible idea.

5391
03:22:08,429 --> 03:22:11,258
ORION: We just had a bunch of chicken.

5392
03:22:11,258 --> 03:22:12,311
MARISHA: Oh you mean like right now?

5393
03:22:12,311 --> 03:22:13,144
Yeah, don't do it right now.

5394
03:22:13,144 --> 03:22:13,977
ZAC: If you tell them what you want,

5395
03:22:13,977 --> 03:22:15,004
all of a sudden I'll get a call, like,

5396
03:22:15,004 --> 03:22:16,216
"your food is on the way!"

5397
03:22:16,216 --> 03:22:18,259
MARISHA: Yeah, no, not right now, maybe next week.

5398
03:22:18,259 --> 03:22:20,255
TRAVIS: Matt, you're going
to Wizard World in Philly.

5399
03:22:20,255 --> 03:22:21,412
But we will not be joining

5400
03:22:21,412 --> 03:22:24,052
because we don't own a
private fucking plane.

5401
03:22:24,052 --> 03:22:25,467
MARISHA: But I'll be there.

5402
03:22:25,467 --> 03:22:26,951
Is anybody else gonna be there?

5403
03:22:26,951 --> 03:22:28,917
TRAVIS: Oh really?

5404
03:22:28,917 --> 03:22:29,750
MARISHA: We'll be there.

5405
03:22:29,750 --> 03:22:31,693
LIAM: Somebody asked something, like,

5406
03:22:31,693 --> 03:22:34,679
what do we hope is the
result of this show?

5407
03:22:34,679 --> 03:22:36,504
I can't remember the wording.

5408
03:22:36,504 --> 03:22:38,819
Obviously we're doing this
because we love each other

5409
03:22:38,819 --> 03:22:41,536
and we're having fun
together, but I also hope,

5410
03:22:41,536 --> 03:22:45,757
D&amp;D has been, its entire
history has been like,

5411
03:22:45,757 --> 03:22:47,711
"oh, it's this weird thing that guys do

5412
03:22:47,711 --> 03:22:50,081
"with dice in a room."

5413
03:22:50,081 --> 03:22:53,120
Anyone can do this, I love video games,

5414
03:22:53,120 --> 03:22:56,886
I work in video games, but
D&amp;D has changed my life.

5415
03:22:56,886 --> 03:23:01,204
It is social, it is person
to person, it is real,

5416
03:23:01,204 --> 03:23:04,103
because it's people in a
room doing shit together,

5417
03:23:04,103 --> 03:23:06,359
and that's kind of lacking
a little bit in our world,

5418
03:23:06,359 --> 03:23:08,068
and I would say find some friends.

5419
03:23:08,068 --> 03:23:09,833
I mean, I love that there are sort of

5420
03:23:09,833 --> 03:23:12,420
online tools to play with
people across the country,

5421
03:23:12,420 --> 03:23:14,545
but if you can find three
or four people in your town

5422
03:23:14,545 --> 03:23:16,712
to do this, I'd say do it.

5423
03:23:17,757 --> 03:23:19,021
Do it.

5424
03:23:19,021 --> 03:23:20,243
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

5425
03:23:20,243 --> 03:23:22,396
MARISHA: There's something really
amazing about the fact

5426
03:23:22,396 --> 03:23:24,835
that we're all essentially
kind of building

5427
03:23:24,835 --> 03:23:28,162
and communally developing
a story together,

5428
03:23:28,162 --> 03:23:30,913
and that's something that not a whole lot

5429
03:23:30,913 --> 03:23:32,121
of things can grant you,

5430
03:23:32,121 --> 03:23:36,121
and we don't really get
in today's society much.

5431
03:23:38,096 --> 03:23:40,756
We're all kinda creating this as a thing.

5432
03:23:40,756 --> 03:23:42,929
And I think it's good
that we're like, hey,

5433
03:23:42,929 --> 03:23:45,034
this is socially acceptable.

5434
03:23:45,034 --> 03:23:48,071
D&amp;D's cool, everyone should play D&amp;D.

5435
03:23:48,071 --> 03:23:50,645
MATT: Actually, the IT Crowd episode of D&amp;D

5436
03:23:50,645 --> 03:23:52,771
is one of the best on camera examples

5437
03:23:52,771 --> 03:23:54,084
of a D&amp;D game night thing.

5438
03:23:54,084 --> 03:23:55,230
ORION: That is an awesome episode.

5439
03:23:55,230 --> 03:23:56,826
MATT: Fucking hilarious, and a great,

5440
03:23:56,826 --> 03:23:59,769
truncated version of this
is kinda what the game is.

5441
03:23:59,769 --> 03:24:01,490
So good on you.

5442
03:24:01,490 --> 03:24:03,080
ORION: Cut to them weeping.

5443
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:04,088
TALIESIN: So many questions going so quickly.

5444
03:24:04,088 --> 03:24:05,378
MATT: I know.

5445
03:24:05,378 --> 03:24:07,333
ASHLEY: I want a Grog shirt that says "do it."

5446
03:24:07,333 --> 03:24:09,626
TALIESIN: And the kitty shirts were an accident.

5447
03:24:09,626 --> 03:24:10,980
This was not planned.

5448
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:11,813
MARISHA: Oh yeah, our kitty shirts.

5449
03:24:11,813 --> 03:24:13,720
LIAM: Someone's saying what
edition to start with?

5450
03:24:13,720 --> 03:24:15,239
I would start with the most recent,

5451
03:24:15,239 --> 03:24:16,705
because you know they're
gonna keep updating

5452
03:24:16,705 --> 03:24:17,843
it over the years.

5453
03:24:17,843 --> 03:24:20,042
MATT: Fifth is great, Fifth
is a great entry point.

5454
03:24:20,042 --> 03:24:20,875
LIAM: It's really loose.

5455
03:24:20,875 --> 03:24:22,332
I feel like all of us felt like,

5456
03:24:22,332 --> 03:24:25,386
we were doing Pathfinder, and...

5457
03:24:25,386 --> 03:24:27,128
Fucking loved it, otherwise
we wouldn't be doing it,

5458
03:24:27,128 --> 03:24:29,402
but it was really intricate,

5459
03:24:29,402 --> 03:24:31,848
and we were doing it
every six or seven weeks,

5460
03:24:31,848 --> 03:24:33,953
when we were off-air, so.

5461
03:24:33,953 --> 03:24:35,792
We felt like the rules
were really complicated

5462
03:24:35,792 --> 03:24:37,862
and we'd lose track of it.

5463
03:24:37,862 --> 03:24:39,063
We loved doing it, obviously,

5464
03:24:39,063 --> 03:24:42,646
but Fifth Edition is
really fast and loose.

5465
03:24:44,356 --> 03:24:45,319
I recommend that.

5466
03:24:45,319 --> 03:24:46,900
And Travis just stuck
his finger in my ear,

5467
03:24:46,900 --> 03:24:48,483
he kinda does that.

5468
03:24:49,655 --> 03:24:51,988
He hits me in the nads a lot.

5469
03:24:53,275 --> 03:24:56,431
MATT: This is a homebrew campaign.

5470
03:24:56,431 --> 03:24:58,956
I wrote it all just kind
of for the hell of it.

5471
03:24:58,956 --> 03:25:02,502
Custom, don't really base
it on anything existing.

5472
03:25:02,502 --> 03:25:03,710
I feel like I'm playing
more in that world,

5473
03:25:03,710 --> 03:25:06,398
and I always hate the idea
of, in the middle of DMing,

5474
03:25:06,398 --> 03:25:07,805
having to go to a module,

5475
03:25:07,805 --> 03:25:10,163
or having to look for a
rule that wasn't my own.

5476
03:25:10,163 --> 03:25:11,398
It feels more detached.

5477
03:25:11,398 --> 03:25:12,318
There are modules that are great,

5478
03:25:12,318 --> 03:25:13,266
and I've run great modules,

5479
03:25:13,266 --> 03:25:15,104
but for me personally, with the pacing,

5480
03:25:15,104 --> 03:25:17,345
and the flow of the game,
I prefer to do homebrew.

5481
03:25:17,345 --> 03:25:20,492
LIAM: Connected to that, someone
asked, if you had any tips,

5482
03:25:20,492 --> 03:25:21,782
and I'd like to know
the answer to this too,

5483
03:25:21,782 --> 03:25:23,879
because I'm running a game
for my eight-year-old son

5484
03:25:23,879 --> 03:25:25,959
and his friends who are about to start,

5485
03:25:25,959 --> 03:25:28,581
do you have any tips for new DM's?

5486
03:25:28,581 --> 03:25:29,802
MATT: Yes.

5487
03:25:29,802 --> 03:25:30,941
Let's see.

5488
03:25:30,941 --> 03:25:32,917
I could do a whole panel on that.

5489
03:25:32,917 --> 03:25:34,993
Tips for new DMs.

5490
03:25:34,993 --> 03:25:36,414
Preparation is important.

5491
03:25:36,414 --> 03:25:40,954
You wanna outline cities,
come up with ideas for NPCs,

5492
03:25:40,954 --> 03:25:43,707
that you think would be
essential to a story,

5493
03:25:43,707 --> 03:25:46,207
or like people that really
run elements of the town.

5494
03:25:46,207 --> 03:25:47,962
Simple notes can be
like, they're this race,

5495
03:25:47,962 --> 03:25:49,775
this is their disposition,

5496
03:25:49,775 --> 03:25:51,506
if you have a particular
voice you wanna try for,

5497
03:25:51,506 --> 03:25:53,410
make a note of this kind of voice.

5498
03:25:53,410 --> 03:25:55,486
So whenever you come back
to them you have a reminder.

5499
03:25:55,486 --> 03:25:58,048
And spend a lot of time
building that structure,

5500
03:25:58,048 --> 03:25:59,629
you don't have to be too detailed.

5501
03:25:59,629 --> 03:26:01,449
Always leave room to play in the world,

5502
03:26:01,449 --> 03:26:03,304
because you never know what
your players are gonna do.

5503
03:26:03,304 --> 03:26:05,531
Be prepared to improv.

5504
03:26:05,531 --> 03:26:07,129
I prefer loose preparation,

5505
03:26:07,129 --> 03:26:10,945
and then just kinda rolling
where the players take you.

5506
03:26:10,945 --> 03:26:13,872
LIAM: Although you wrote a
monologue for Clarence, right?

5507
03:26:13,872 --> 03:26:15,659
Because that was very intricate.

5508
03:26:15,659 --> 03:26:16,798
We were all just ready--

5509
03:26:16,798 --> 03:26:19,756
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's no way you
just thought that up.

5510
03:26:19,756 --> 03:26:20,902
MATT: There are certain elements,

5511
03:26:20,902 --> 03:26:23,183
part of the notes I take
is for certain NPCs

5512
03:26:23,183 --> 03:26:25,692
I'll write down key
information that they know,

5513
03:26:25,692 --> 03:26:27,230
and depending on how you ask them,

5514
03:26:27,230 --> 03:26:28,063
what you say to them,

5515
03:26:28,063 --> 03:26:29,638
and what you try and extract from them,

5516
03:26:29,638 --> 03:26:32,033
they might give you
some of the information,

5517
03:26:32,033 --> 03:26:34,572
they might not, if you coerce
them, or intimidate them.

5518
03:26:34,572 --> 03:26:37,223
Or if they're willing to
give up the information,

5519
03:26:37,223 --> 03:26:38,525
I have all that written down.

5520
03:26:38,525 --> 03:26:39,859
So for that information today,

5521
03:26:39,859 --> 03:26:42,397
you guys were asking
him, and since you allied

5522
03:26:42,397 --> 03:26:47,020
with Clarence, he was
willing to discuss with you.

5523
03:26:47,020 --> 03:26:48,042
So I had all that prewritten,

5524
03:26:48,042 --> 03:26:49,549
but depending on how much you said,

5525
03:26:49,549 --> 03:26:51,257
it was what you guys asked.

5526
03:26:51,257 --> 03:26:52,590
LIAM: Do you have

5527
03:26:53,482 --> 03:26:55,583
random encounters ready,
in case we're like,

5528
03:26:55,583 --> 03:26:57,574
"ah, fuck it, I don't wanna
go down to the dungeon,

5529
03:26:57,574 --> 03:26:59,524
"I wanna go back up and
beat up some dwarves."

5530
03:26:59,524 --> 03:27:02,923
Do you have shit kind of ready?

5531
03:27:02,923 --> 03:27:05,118
MATT: Yep. I have a stack of different creature

5532
03:27:05,118 --> 03:27:06,554
and encounters already prebuilt,

5533
03:27:06,554 --> 03:27:09,529
based on what you guys may encounter.

5534
03:27:09,529 --> 03:27:11,126
Tonight was an example
of players being able

5535
03:27:11,126 --> 03:27:12,959
to pick what happened.

5536
03:27:13,795 --> 03:27:16,095
But also it's one of those
things where it depended,

5537
03:27:16,095 --> 03:27:17,418
I don't know where you guys are gonna go.

5538
03:27:17,418 --> 03:27:18,761
I present a story,

5539
03:27:18,761 --> 03:27:21,168
I present an idea of a
general throughline,

5540
03:27:21,168 --> 03:27:23,829
but how you guys go
from point A to point B,

5541
03:27:23,829 --> 03:27:24,853
that's entirely up to you.

5542
03:27:24,853 --> 03:27:26,799
Sometimes that can be a
very long, meandering line,

5543
03:27:26,799 --> 03:27:29,524
sometimes it could be a direct ray, so.

5544
03:27:29,524 --> 03:27:31,205
TRAVIS: There was a question, how
much do you improvise,

5545
03:27:31,205 --> 03:27:33,373
and when is it appropriate to improvise?

5546
03:27:33,373 --> 03:27:35,248
MATT: A lot, and always.

5547
03:27:35,248 --> 03:27:37,229
MARISHA: Always, yeah.

5548
03:27:37,229 --> 03:27:38,685
TRAVIS: The answer is yes.

5549
03:27:38,685 --> 03:27:41,215
MATT: I've had whole games where
I've prepared a session,

5550
03:27:41,215 --> 03:27:42,310
and none of it happened,

5551
03:27:42,310 --> 03:27:45,853
because people just put
an entirely wrong direction.

5552
03:27:45,853 --> 03:27:48,112
Not wrong, but a different direction.

5553
03:27:48,112 --> 03:27:49,322
So the whole game was just me

5554
03:27:49,322 --> 03:27:50,827
pulling everything out of my ass.

5555
03:27:50,827 --> 03:27:52,911
MARISHA: Like that time we walked
through the back door

5556
03:27:52,911 --> 03:27:55,073
of the Thieves' Guild, that was fun.

5557
03:27:55,073 --> 03:27:56,476
MATT: Yeah, there was that.

5558
03:27:56,476 --> 03:27:58,886
MARISHA: What's up, Thieves' Guild.

5559
03:27:58,886 --> 03:28:00,318
'Sup.

5560
03:28:02,531 --> 03:28:04,448
ORION: Donkey Kong, Pikachu.

5561
03:28:05,566 --> 03:28:06,399
TRAVIS: What?

5562
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:07,706
ORION: Somebody asked me what my favorite

5563
03:28:07,706 --> 03:28:09,146
Smash Brothers character is.

5564
03:28:09,146 --> 03:28:10,019
TRAVIS: Oh.

5565
03:28:10,019 --> 03:28:14,081
LIAM: Somebody asked how we
pick the character class

5566
03:28:14,081 --> 03:28:15,567
that we picked.

5567
03:28:15,567 --> 03:28:17,523
When we first started
this game, and I said,

5568
03:28:17,523 --> 03:28:20,766
"hey, it's my birthday,
I wanna play a game."

5569
03:28:20,766 --> 03:28:23,149
Laura really likes rogues as well,

5570
03:28:23,149 --> 03:28:26,462
but I made sure that as
fast as I fucking could.

5571
03:28:26,462 --> 03:28:27,545
TRAVIS: She was pissed.

5572
03:28:27,545 --> 03:28:28,878
LIAM: So she, yeah.

5573
03:28:28,878 --> 03:28:32,692
She plays rogue, in like
Dragon Age and everything.

5574
03:28:32,692 --> 03:28:33,871
That shit's a favorite class of hers,

5575
03:28:33,871 --> 03:28:35,123
so I know I got it out there.

5576
03:28:35,123 --> 03:28:36,817
Also, the reason that we're twins

5577
03:28:36,817 --> 03:28:38,873
is because Laura and I have
the exact same birthday,

5578
03:28:38,873 --> 03:28:39,706
May 28th.

5579
03:28:41,119 --> 03:28:42,289
ASHLEY: I didn't know that.

5580
03:28:42,289 --> 03:28:43,240
MARISHA: I didn't know that either.

5581
03:28:43,240 --> 03:28:45,507
LIAM: That's why we're twins.

5582
03:28:45,507 --> 03:28:46,340
MARISHA: That's cool.

5583
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:49,113
ASHLEY: I knew-- I came in late to the game,

5584
03:28:49,113 --> 03:28:51,142
and there were only a couple options left.

5585
03:28:51,142 --> 03:28:53,432
And I had never played, so.

5586
03:28:53,432 --> 03:28:55,323
I picked gnome because I
was like, oh, that's funny.

5587
03:28:55,323 --> 03:28:59,162
And then cleric, I didn't really
realize what a cleric was.

5588
03:28:59,162 --> 03:29:03,180
And how detailed it can
be if you've never played.

5589
03:29:03,180 --> 03:29:04,239
And important to the game.

5590
03:29:04,239 --> 03:29:06,618
So when I started I was like, well shit,

5591
03:29:06,618 --> 03:29:09,134
this is a little tougher
than I thought it would be.

5592
03:29:09,134 --> 03:29:13,039
But it's been awesome,
I love being a cleric.

5593
03:29:13,039 --> 03:29:14,278
LIAM: I'm so glad we pulled you in.

5594
03:29:14,278 --> 03:29:16,111
ASHLEY: Me too, man, me too.

5595
03:29:18,532 --> 03:29:21,913
Oh, also, someone asked,
who is Pike's deity.

5596
03:29:21,913 --> 03:29:25,535
And it's Sarenrae, the goddess of healing

5597
03:29:25,535 --> 03:29:28,545
and redemption, among other things.

5598
03:29:28,545 --> 03:29:31,609
MATT: Which is carried over
actually from Pathfinder.

5599
03:29:31,609 --> 03:29:34,447
Fifth Edition has its own suggested,

5600
03:29:34,447 --> 03:29:36,979
there's never a definitive pantheon.

5601
03:29:36,979 --> 03:29:39,398
But they have the deity pantheon.

5602
03:29:39,398 --> 03:29:40,977
But we're carrying over Pathfinder deities

5603
03:29:40,977 --> 03:29:44,092
that were prominently in the campaign
up to this certain point,

5604
03:29:44,092 --> 03:29:45,133
because why the hell not?

5605
03:29:45,133 --> 03:29:46,296
We're not gonna make her change her deity,

5606
03:29:46,296 --> 03:29:47,457
that would be weird.

5607
03:29:47,457 --> 03:29:48,891
MARISHA: Travis, how did you pick your character?

5608
03:29:48,891 --> 03:29:49,724
TRAVIS: What?

5609
03:29:49,724 --> 03:29:50,936
Oh.

5610
03:29:50,936 --> 03:29:54,369
I asked what the biggest
playable character was, I think.

5611
03:29:54,369 --> 03:29:57,869
One that liked to fight, drink, and fight.

5612
03:30:00,998 --> 03:30:02,379
LIAM: One of the greatest pleasures for me,

5613
03:30:02,379 --> 03:30:05,080
and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger,

5614
03:30:05,080 --> 03:30:08,210
and this is just me reliving high school.

5615
03:30:08,210 --> 03:30:11,091
When I was talking to Sam
about starting all this,

5616
03:30:11,091 --> 03:30:12,332
and saying hey, let's get together,

5617
03:30:12,332 --> 03:30:13,930
it's what I wanna do for my birthday,

5618
03:30:13,930 --> 03:30:17,145
we pulled Travis in,
Travis is fucking tight,

5619
03:30:17,145 --> 03:30:18,295
look at him.

5620
03:30:18,295 --> 03:30:20,761
He's not the stereotypical D&amp;D player,

5621
03:30:20,761 --> 03:30:23,215
and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us.

5622
03:30:23,215 --> 03:30:25,727
Play Dungeons &amp; Dragons,
please play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5623
03:30:25,727 --> 03:30:26,560
TRAVIS: It was so good.

5624
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:27,393
ASHLEY: It's the best.

5625
03:30:27,393 --> 03:30:28,226
LIAM: It'll make you so happy.

5626
03:30:28,226 --> 03:30:29,322
ORION: What about you?

5627
03:30:29,322 --> 03:30:30,840
Keyleth?

5628
03:30:30,840 --> 03:30:32,922
MARISHA: I remember at the time I had a,

5629
03:30:32,922 --> 03:30:34,203
we were playing another campaign,

5630
03:30:34,203 --> 03:30:36,935
and I had like a rogue assassin,

5631
03:30:36,935 --> 03:30:38,893
that you were in with me.

5632
03:30:38,893 --> 03:30:42,724
And I had a kind of assassin character

5633
03:30:42,724 --> 03:30:47,495
who was super seductress,
and really high charisma.

5634
03:30:47,495 --> 03:30:49,322
And I remember when I joined this game,

5635
03:30:49,322 --> 03:30:52,379
I didn't really know any of you guys

5636
03:30:52,379 --> 03:30:53,243
really all that well,

5637
03:30:53,243 --> 03:30:55,403
and I was kind of new to this world,

5638
03:30:55,403 --> 03:30:58,348
so I ended up going with a kind of druid,

5639
03:30:58,348 --> 03:31:00,815
and I kind of deliberately
made her introvert,

5640
03:31:00,815 --> 03:31:04,648
in a weird way to kind
of reflect my newcoming

5641
03:31:05,743 --> 03:31:07,203
to the group, but I was like,

5642
03:31:07,203 --> 03:31:09,644
"whoa, it'll be like I can be quiet."

5643
03:31:09,644 --> 03:31:11,381
so Keyleth has a really low charisma,

5644
03:31:11,381 --> 03:31:14,743
but I kind of spin it
in that she's naive,

5645
03:31:14,743 --> 03:31:16,484
and doesn't really know.

5646
03:31:16,484 --> 03:31:20,042
And that's why she says
things like, "but Clarence."

5647
03:31:20,042 --> 03:31:21,046
(all laugh)

5648
03:31:21,046 --> 03:31:22,621
MARISHA: "You're just special."

5649
03:31:22,621 --> 03:31:26,033
Because she's naive, and kind of quiet.

5650
03:31:26,033 --> 03:31:27,458
So she was just different than anything

5651
03:31:27,458 --> 03:31:28,910
I've played before.

5652
03:31:28,910 --> 03:31:30,244
But I really love being a druid.

5653
03:31:30,244 --> 03:31:32,267
Druids are great.

5654
03:31:32,267 --> 03:31:34,735
TALIESIN: I played a lot in school.

5655
03:31:34,735 --> 03:31:35,905
Other than Matt,

5656
03:31:35,905 --> 03:31:38,745
I probably had the most
experience playing D&amp;D,

5657
03:31:38,745 --> 03:31:39,887
and playing roleplaying games.

5658
03:31:39,887 --> 03:31:41,175
TRAVIS: Yeah you did.

5659
03:31:41,175 --> 03:31:42,231
Genius.

5660
03:31:42,231 --> 03:31:45,443
TALIESIN: So I was really excited by
the gunslinger in Pathfinder

5661
03:31:45,443 --> 03:31:48,244
just 'cause it was something
I hadn't done before.

5662
03:31:48,244 --> 03:31:51,797
So I found it the most
interesting and unusual,

5663
03:31:51,797 --> 03:31:55,733
but I was not, and I also
felt it was a hole within

5664
03:31:55,733 --> 03:31:57,924
the group that could be filled very well.

5665
03:31:57,924 --> 03:32:00,739
LIAM: Thedouginator
keeps asking you, Matt,

5666
03:32:00,739 --> 03:32:02,484
how you brought the party together

5667
03:32:02,484 --> 03:32:04,760
the first day of play.

5668
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:07,972
MARISHA: Wait, we haven't heard
Tiberius' story as sorcerer.

5669
03:32:07,972 --> 03:32:10,770
Then we can answer that question.

5670
03:32:10,770 --> 03:32:12,325
ORION: When this was going on,

5671
03:32:12,325 --> 03:32:15,142
I asked Matt if there was a caster yet,

5672
03:32:15,142 --> 03:32:18,794
like any glass cannons, and he said no.

5673
03:32:18,794 --> 03:32:22,377
So I debated between
a wizard and sorcerer.

5674
03:32:23,510 --> 03:32:26,502
When we went over the different mechanics,

5675
03:32:26,502 --> 03:32:29,167
how a wizard and a sorcerer works,

5676
03:32:29,167 --> 03:32:31,268
I was more drawn to that.

5677
03:32:31,268 --> 03:32:33,945
And I'm a huge RPG guy.

5678
03:32:33,945 --> 03:32:36,028
LIAM: You're so entertaining.

5679
03:32:36,963 --> 03:32:38,960
ORION: To piggyback a quick question,

5680
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:41,556
to seal off the Tiberius thing,

5681
03:32:41,556 --> 03:32:44,306
somebody asked if any of our voice acting

5682
03:32:44,306 --> 03:32:46,765
influences our characters.

5683
03:32:46,765 --> 03:32:48,446
Tiberius, absolutely.

5684
03:32:48,446 --> 03:32:52,446
I played Elminster Aumar
in the Neverwinter MMO.

5685
03:32:53,872 --> 03:32:55,426
Which is a D&amp;D MMO.

5686
03:32:55,426 --> 03:32:57,180
And when we started this

5687
03:32:57,180 --> 03:32:59,847
I'm essentially doing Elminster,

5688
03:33:01,739 --> 03:33:04,072
but I made him super bubbly.

5689
03:33:07,302 --> 03:33:09,586
TALIESIN: No, someone asked how the group, yeah.

5690
03:33:09,586 --> 03:33:12,037
MATT: We got together, first
session, essentially,

5691
03:33:12,037 --> 03:33:14,823
was in a swamp town named Stillben,

5692
03:33:14,823 --> 03:33:16,989
and the group at the time had,

5693
03:33:16,989 --> 03:33:18,480
for their own separate reasons,

5694
03:33:18,480 --> 03:33:20,514
been in this town, needing money,

5695
03:33:20,514 --> 03:33:24,064
and had kind of come
together as a mercenary group

5696
03:33:24,064 --> 03:33:25,641
out of necessity.

5697
03:33:25,641 --> 03:33:29,356
So the first session was
them having known each other

5698
03:33:29,356 --> 03:33:32,319
from a circumstance where they
all ended up helping out

5699
03:33:32,319 --> 03:33:34,940
an individual in the city, long story short,

5700
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:37,237
they had a small rapport,

5701
03:33:37,237 --> 03:33:39,162
and knew at least each
other were useful,

5702
03:33:39,162 --> 03:33:40,643
and needed cash.

5703
03:33:40,643 --> 03:33:41,811
And there was a job board in the town.

5704
03:33:41,811 --> 03:33:44,621
So the first session was them being hired

5705
03:33:44,621 --> 03:33:48,134
to look into a conspiracy
within this swamp

5706
03:33:48,134 --> 03:33:50,566
port town, Stillben.

5707
03:33:50,566 --> 03:33:52,387
That was their first
real adventure together.

5708
03:33:52,387 --> 03:33:56,578
And when that finished,
they kept going from there.

5709
03:33:56,578 --> 03:33:58,483
ORION: Uh, troll penis story.

5710
03:33:58,483 --> 03:33:59,316
ASHLEY: Troll penis.

5711
03:33:59,316 --> 03:34:00,665
(all laugh)

5712
03:34:00,665 --> 03:34:01,498
MARISHA: That's fair.

5713
03:34:01,498 --> 03:34:03,045
ORION: I know you guys keep asking.

5714
03:34:03,045 --> 03:34:05,382
LIAM: Take it away, Mercer.

5715
03:34:05,382 --> 03:34:07,132
MATT: There was a battle.

5716
03:34:08,275 --> 03:34:09,672
Subterranean battle
that involved the party

5717
03:34:09,672 --> 03:34:13,839
sneaking upon a group of two
trolls that were around a fire.

5718
03:34:14,812 --> 03:34:18,513
The idea to work past
this came to Tiberius

5719
03:34:18,513 --> 03:34:22,808
to transform himself
visually into a female troll

5720
03:34:22,808 --> 03:34:24,572
so he could Bugs Bunny them.

5721
03:34:24,572 --> 03:34:27,565
Hey boys, you know, that thing.

5722
03:34:27,565 --> 03:34:29,371
Not knowing the temperament of trolls,

5723
03:34:29,371 --> 03:34:31,120
especially ones that are deep underground,

5724
03:34:31,120 --> 03:34:32,933
and don't get to see
female trolls very often,

5725
03:34:32,933 --> 03:34:34,636
they immediately just
got extremely aggressive,

5726
03:34:34,636 --> 03:34:35,826
and he found himself almost between

5727
03:34:35,826 --> 03:34:37,826
a rock and a hard place.

5728
03:34:38,761 --> 03:34:41,082
ORION: I was getting raped by trolls.

5729
03:34:41,082 --> 03:34:44,111
MATT: The party then descended
upon these trolls,

5730
03:34:44,111 --> 03:34:47,142
and in the middle of
battle, at numerous times,

5731
03:34:47,142 --> 03:34:49,825
I believe Percy once and Laura the other,

5732
03:34:49,825 --> 03:34:54,225
both took specific shots
at each troll's dick.

5733
03:34:54,225 --> 03:34:59,055
Rolled a good shot with enough
damage to blow them off.

5734
03:34:59,055 --> 03:35:02,369
Now being a troll, they regenerate.

5735
03:35:02,369 --> 03:35:05,919
But it was still a good effect,
and when the battle was over,

5736
03:35:05,919 --> 03:35:07,687
it was decided by the party to at least

5737
03:35:07,687 --> 03:35:10,065
take one as a trophy and place
it in the bag of holding.

5738
03:35:10,065 --> 03:35:12,193
TRAVIS: That was decided by me, thank you.

5739
03:35:12,193 --> 03:35:14,507
MATT: By Grog, and as such,
it stayed for a while,

5740
03:35:14,507 --> 03:35:16,505
until it was used as an
implement of distraction

5741
03:35:16,505 --> 03:35:17,870
in another encounter I believe.

5742
03:35:17,870 --> 03:35:18,703
TRAVIS: It worked.

5743
03:35:18,703 --> 03:35:19,536
MATT: Yeah, it worked.

5744
03:35:19,536 --> 03:35:20,825
That was where troll dick came from.

5745
03:35:20,825 --> 03:35:22,287
ORION: It was spitroasting.

5746
03:35:22,287 --> 03:35:24,788
LIAM: Jake Bodro asked what's it like playing

5747
03:35:24,788 --> 03:35:27,023
for three hours in front of 2,500 people?

5748
03:35:27,023 --> 03:35:29,923
I think our games have
gotten a little bit better,

5749
03:35:29,923 --> 03:35:32,761
only because when we play privately,

5750
03:35:32,761 --> 03:35:35,828
there were sometimes lulls,
where we weren't sure what to do,

5751
03:35:35,828 --> 03:35:38,025
we would go off to bathroom,
we would take a break.

5752
03:35:38,025 --> 03:35:40,787
But now there's a little bit
of the element of theater to it.

5753
03:35:40,787 --> 03:35:42,329
Just a sprinkle of it.

5754
03:35:42,329 --> 03:35:44,580
And it kinda of gooses the energy up.

5755
03:35:44,580 --> 03:35:46,049
ORION: I'm doing the same thing for the record.

5756
03:35:48,284 --> 03:35:49,586
TRAVIS: I keep seeing this one.

5757
03:35:49,586 --> 03:35:51,479
For the 11 year old Sadie,

5758
03:35:51,479 --> 03:35:53,251
the son of Odin shall have that cookie!

5759
03:35:53,251 --> 03:35:54,834
MATT: Aw, that's sweet.

5760
03:35:56,223 --> 03:35:57,473
ASHLEY: There you go.

5761
03:35:59,093 --> 03:36:00,809
MATT: There is one bag of holding in the group,

5762
03:36:00,809 --> 03:36:02,726
and Grog always has it.

5763
03:36:04,026 --> 03:36:07,091
TRAVIS: A troll dick
and a bulette tongue.

5764
03:36:07,091 --> 03:36:08,427
MATT: There are many things
that go into the bag.

5765
03:36:08,427 --> 03:36:09,465
TRAVIS: It hasn't gone in that bag.

5766
03:36:09,465 --> 03:36:10,793
TALIESIN: Is there still a cow in the bag?

5767
03:36:10,793 --> 03:36:12,639
TRAVIS: No, Dork the ox.

5768
03:36:12,639 --> 03:36:14,338
MATT: Dork the ox is probably not.

5769
03:36:14,338 --> 03:36:17,876
TRAVIS: That's when we first
learned its limitations.

5770
03:36:17,876 --> 03:36:20,696
MATT: Why does Scanlan have
so many awesome spells?

5771
03:36:20,696 --> 03:36:21,974
Bards in Fifth Edition have one

5772
03:36:21,974 --> 03:36:23,650
of the options they can choose.

5773
03:36:23,650 --> 03:36:25,317
As they level up,

5774
03:36:25,317 --> 03:36:27,798
can choose a couple of spells
from any spellcasting class,

5775
03:36:27,798 --> 03:36:29,891
which is great, and the boon that
bards kinda needed to be

5776
03:36:29,891 --> 03:36:31,393
more combat-effective.

5777
03:36:31,393 --> 03:36:33,330
And you can choose the School of Lore

5778
03:36:33,330 --> 03:36:36,161
or the School of Combat,
I think, for the bard.

5779
03:36:36,161 --> 03:36:37,113
He chose the School of
Lore which allows you

5780
03:36:37,113 --> 03:36:38,615
even more spells from other classes

5781
03:36:38,615 --> 03:36:39,739
to boost your repertoire,

5782
03:36:39,739 --> 03:36:42,952
so he became a fucking amazing bard.

5783
03:36:42,952 --> 03:36:47,287
LIAM: Also, Sam Riegel did a lot
of a capella in college.

5784
03:36:47,287 --> 03:36:49,612
TRAVIS: He did, he really did.

5785
03:36:49,612 --> 03:36:53,884
LIAM: He helped write several
seasons of The Voice,

5786
03:36:53,884 --> 03:36:55,195
which was all about a capella,

5787
03:36:55,195 --> 03:36:58,087
so Samis sort of a ringer
for the bard class.

5788
03:36:58,087 --> 03:36:59,242
MATT: Yeah, kinda had to happen that way.

5789
03:36:59,242 --> 03:37:01,106
TRAVIS: Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation?

5790
03:37:01,106 --> 03:37:01,939
MARISHA: Nope.

5791
03:37:02,864 --> 03:37:03,697
LIAM: Yordee yorda--

5792
03:37:03,697 --> 03:37:05,769
MARISHA: Yorda youree yourdee yourd.

5793
03:37:05,769 --> 03:37:08,985
ASHLEY: Someone asked if Grog could keep

5794
03:37:08,985 --> 03:37:11,118
one of his women in the bag of holding.

5795
03:37:11,118 --> 03:37:13,400
You can't put living things
in the bag of holding.

5796
03:37:13,400 --> 03:37:14,720
TALIESIN: As we've learned.

5797
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:16,102
MATT: You can.
MARISHA: With Dork.

5798
03:37:16,102 --> 03:37:17,508
MATT: They just die.

5799
03:37:17,508 --> 03:37:19,894
TRAVIS: There's no air, it's like a vacuum.

5800
03:37:19,894 --> 03:37:21,019
A magical vacuum.

5801
03:37:21,019 --> 03:37:22,305
MATT: Dork the ox did not survive.

5802
03:37:23,473 --> 03:37:26,391
TRAVIS: One giant dead ox came out of the bag.

5803
03:37:26,391 --> 03:37:28,233
LIAM: Someone keeps asking if any of us

5804
03:37:28,233 --> 03:37:30,608
have hirelings, or henchmen,

5805
03:37:30,608 --> 03:37:32,012
and the simple answer to that is no.

5806
03:37:32,012 --> 03:37:33,116
MATT: That's not true.

5807
03:37:33,116 --> 03:37:33,949
LIAM: Just Trinket.

5808
03:37:33,949 --> 03:37:35,443
ORION: At our Keep.

5809
03:37:35,443 --> 03:37:36,276
TALIESIN: We do.

5810
03:37:36,276 --> 03:37:37,859
LIAM: Oh, that's right!

5811
03:37:38,905 --> 03:37:40,085
TRAVIS: Yeah, we battle-tested them.

5812
03:37:40,085 --> 03:37:41,687
ORION: We have a Keep back in--

5813
03:37:41,687 --> 03:37:42,787
LIAM: Right before we started.

5814
03:37:42,787 --> 03:37:44,288
TRAVIS: The game before we came here.

5815
03:37:44,288 --> 03:37:46,163
After they saved the kingdom of Eman,

5816
03:37:46,163 --> 03:37:48,856
the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III,

5817
03:37:48,856 --> 03:37:51,000
as part of his gift to the group

5818
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:53,025
for essentially saving his family

5819
03:37:53,025 --> 03:37:57,974
and the city itself, had a
Keep constructed for them,

5820
03:37:57,974 --> 03:37:59,107
and took about six months or so,

5821
03:37:59,107 --> 03:37:59,940
and the Keep was finished,

5822
03:37:59,940 --> 03:38:02,678
and then the party's first
session

5823
03:38:02,678 --> 03:38:05,399
was them finding who they're going to hire

5824
03:38:05,399 --> 03:38:06,662
to take care of the Keep for them.

5825
03:38:06,662 --> 03:38:08,959
LIAM: It was like one episode of the Sims.

5826
03:38:08,959 --> 03:38:09,792
MATT: Kind of.

5827
03:38:09,792 --> 03:38:12,372
It was great too, 'cause Grog's whole idea

5828
03:38:12,372 --> 03:38:14,807
of making them to see who
would be the better hire

5829
03:38:14,807 --> 03:38:16,759
was to break the pool cue and be like,

5830
03:38:16,759 --> 03:38:17,843
"who survives?"

5831
03:38:17,843 --> 03:38:19,092
Make them fight, it was pretty great.

5832
03:38:19,092 --> 03:38:22,618
TALIESIN: For Tone17, I played
a modified Malkavian,

5833
03:38:22,618 --> 03:38:24,789
and a Smetty if you can
believe such a thing,

5834
03:38:24,789 --> 03:38:27,120
which was badass.

5835
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:28,174
MATT: There you go.

5836
03:38:28,174 --> 03:38:30,921
LIAM: We've been playing for
two and a half years.

5837
03:38:30,921 --> 03:38:32,166
Someone wanted to know how long.

5838
03:38:32,166 --> 03:38:33,111
TALIESIN: Oh my God, really?

5839
03:38:33,111 --> 03:38:34,530
TRAVIS: Did we tell them about your podcast

5840
03:38:34,530 --> 03:38:36,080
with the recording of the very first one?

5841
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:44,275
LIAM: If you want, Sam and I,
it's kind of languishing,

5842
03:38:44,275 --> 03:38:47,255
but we have a podcast
together called AllWorkNoPlay.

5843
03:38:47,255 --> 03:38:48,088
TRAVIS: It's amazing.

5844
03:38:48,088 --> 03:38:50,341
LIAM: We're both parents, we have kids,

5845
03:38:50,341 --> 03:38:52,147
so we have no time to do anything.

5846
03:38:52,147 --> 03:38:55,217
Enough time to take a shit.

5847
03:38:55,217 --> 03:38:56,632
The first or second episode,

5848
03:38:56,632 --> 03:38:59,334
the first episode is about
us playing the first game,

5849
03:38:59,334 --> 03:39:01,678
and there's audio from the first game.

5850
03:39:01,678 --> 03:39:05,845
Again, go to iTunes, or to
AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean,

5851
03:39:08,140 --> 03:39:10,550
and you'll hear about two minutes of us

5852
03:39:10,550 --> 03:39:14,096
dealing with a puzzle
that Matt threw at us.

5853
03:39:14,096 --> 03:39:15,197
MARISHA: It was timed.

5854
03:39:15,197 --> 03:39:18,854
LIAM: Yeah, it was timed, there
was an hourglass going off.

5855
03:39:18,854 --> 03:39:22,490
It was us discovering
D&amp;D really for the first time.

5856
03:39:22,490 --> 03:39:24,924
AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.

5857
03:39:24,924 --> 03:39:26,234
MARISHA: Actually one of my favorite stories

5858
03:39:26,234 --> 03:39:28,133
that I tell all the time is about you,

5859
03:39:28,133 --> 03:39:31,759
from our first game, 'cause if
you remember, I didn't play.

5860
03:39:31,759 --> 03:39:35,228
I just kinda helped Matt help you guys.

5861
03:39:35,228 --> 03:39:37,102
I was like a D&amp;D minion.

5862
03:39:37,102 --> 03:39:38,544
And I remember I was helping you,

5863
03:39:38,544 --> 03:39:40,169
and I remember you were like,

5864
03:39:40,169 --> 03:39:44,971
"So, if I just wanted to go
up and punch those guards,

5865
03:39:44,971 --> 03:39:46,225
"I could do that?"

5866
03:39:46,225 --> 03:39:47,453
And I was like, yeah,
well you would go up,

5867
03:39:47,453 --> 03:39:48,286
and you would punch them,

5868
03:39:48,286 --> 03:39:50,278
and then Matt would tell
you how you'd do that.

5869
03:39:50,278 --> 03:39:53,861
And then you went like
this, you were like.

5870
03:39:56,361 --> 03:39:57,194
TRAVIS: Computing.

5871
03:39:57,194 --> 03:40:00,922
MARISHA: Yeah, you were like,
"so, we can do anything?"

5872
03:40:00,922 --> 03:40:02,392
(all laugh)

5873
03:40:02,392 --> 03:40:04,142
MARISHA: And I was like, yeah.

5874
03:40:05,371 --> 03:40:09,125
LIAM: Taliesin on game one
was actually not Percy,

5875
03:40:09,125 --> 03:40:11,024
he was a dragonborn paladin?

5876
03:40:11,024 --> 03:40:12,229
TALIESIN: I was a dragonborn paladin.

5877
03:40:12,229 --> 03:40:14,321
LIAM: You fucking blew our minds, we were like,

5878
03:40:14,321 --> 03:40:15,154
"what do I do?

5879
03:40:15,154 --> 03:40:17,179
"Can I do damage points
to stop this puzzle."

5880
03:40:17,179 --> 03:40:19,591
There was this tunnel with
all these moving parts,

5881
03:40:19,591 --> 03:40:21,233
we thought we were gonna be crushed,

5882
03:40:21,233 --> 03:40:23,220
and he was a dragonborn
for the first episode.

5883
03:40:23,220 --> 03:40:25,720
It's in the recording on the
the AllWorkNoPlay podcast.

5884
03:40:25,720 --> 03:40:30,276
And he just breathed ice
on this water-based--

5885
03:40:30,276 --> 03:40:31,749
TALIESIN: Contraption.

5886
03:40:31,749 --> 03:40:33,803
LIAM: And froze it, and everyone was like,

5887
03:40:33,803 --> 03:40:34,827
"you can do that?

5888
03:40:34,827 --> 03:40:36,256
"You can't just roll dice and hit it?"

5889
03:40:36,256 --> 03:40:37,855
And that's when we kind of understood

5890
03:40:37,855 --> 03:40:39,353
oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.

5891
03:40:39,353 --> 03:40:41,552
TALIESIN: That was such a good game for learning

5892
03:40:41,552 --> 03:40:42,890
the basic mechanics.

5893
03:40:42,890 --> 03:40:44,037
Such a well put together game.

5894
03:40:44,037 --> 03:40:46,404
ORION: Matt does control the
music while we play.

5895
03:40:46,404 --> 03:40:47,643
MATT: Yes, I have playlists.

5896
03:40:47,643 --> 03:40:49,583
They were much more broad playlists before,

5897
03:40:49,583 --> 03:40:50,796
unfortunately on the stream,

5898
03:40:50,796 --> 03:40:54,270
we have to use only
approved royalty-free music,

5899
03:40:54,270 --> 03:40:55,911
so it took me a while to
figure it out previous to this.

5900
03:40:55,911 --> 03:40:57,227
TRAVIS: I do miss those Madonna songs.

5901
03:40:57,227 --> 03:40:58,417
MATT: I know.

5902
03:40:58,417 --> 03:41:00,562
I used to play a lot of Bush.

5903
03:41:00,562 --> 03:41:02,425
MARISHA: Hey, would that count as fan art?

5904
03:41:02,425 --> 03:41:05,049
If fans made us music?

5905
03:41:05,049 --> 03:41:05,882
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5906
03:41:05,882 --> 03:41:06,715
MARISHA: Could we then use that?

5907
03:41:08,365 --> 03:41:09,978
Yeah? He's nodding.

5908
03:41:09,978 --> 03:41:11,678
ZAC: They can send
us whatever they want.

5909
03:41:11,678 --> 03:41:13,795
MARISHA: Some consent forms? Yeah.

5910
03:41:13,795 --> 03:41:14,713
TRAVIS: If one of your characters died,
would you roll a new character?

5911
03:41:14,713 --> 03:41:16,145
ORION: Music people out there.

5912
03:41:16,145 --> 03:41:18,467
MARISHA: Any music people.

5913
03:41:18,467 --> 03:41:21,016
Anything atmospheric.

5914
03:41:22,980 --> 03:41:24,108
LIAM: No, no, that's an important question.

5915
03:41:24,108 --> 03:41:24,941
TRAVIS: Ignore it.

5916
03:41:24,941 --> 03:41:25,774
LIAM: No, it's important.

5917
03:41:25,774 --> 03:41:27,579
Someone's asking, if we die,

5918
03:41:27,579 --> 03:41:29,613
would we roll in a new character?

5919
03:41:29,613 --> 03:41:31,723
And plus, we just started this show,

5920
03:41:31,723 --> 03:41:33,115
so part of us were wondering like,

5921
03:41:33,115 --> 03:41:34,254
what if we die the second episode?

5922
03:41:34,254 --> 03:41:35,087
What happens?

5923
03:41:35,087 --> 03:41:38,089
We recorded this opening
to the show that's coming.

5924
03:41:38,089 --> 03:41:39,769
MATT: So here's how I run the world.

5925
03:41:39,769 --> 03:41:42,372
I feel that one of the
problems in some RPGs

5926
03:41:42,372 --> 03:41:43,948
is that death becomes flippant when magic

5927
03:41:43,948 --> 03:41:45,790
allows you to completely undo it.

5928
03:41:45,790 --> 03:41:48,252
In my campaigns certain powerful spells

5929
03:41:48,252 --> 03:41:50,860
like Greater Restoration, Resurrection,

5930
03:41:50,860 --> 03:41:52,713
things like that are a challenge,

5931
03:41:52,713 --> 03:41:54,847
meaning you can definitely undo death,

5932
03:41:54,847 --> 03:41:56,850
but a lot of it is based
on your capabilities

5933
03:41:56,850 --> 03:41:58,004
as a spellcaster,

5934
03:41:58,004 --> 03:42:00,538
your attachment to the people
you've been traveling with.

5935
03:42:00,538 --> 03:42:03,099
So if ever a character does die,

5936
03:42:03,099 --> 03:42:06,849
a resurrection can be attempted,
but it is a challenge.

5937
03:42:06,849 --> 03:42:08,679
Which means there's a
possibility of it failing.

5938
03:42:08,679 --> 03:42:10,897
In which case, if the resurrection fails,

5939
03:42:10,897 --> 03:42:13,717
the soul is lost, the
character is permanently dead.

5940
03:42:13,717 --> 03:42:16,189
The player then can leave
and never come back

5941
03:42:16,189 --> 03:42:17,022
if they want to,

5942
03:42:17,022 --> 03:42:18,565
but they have the option
to create a new character,

5943
03:42:18,565 --> 03:42:20,104
and be reintroduced to the campaign

5944
03:42:20,104 --> 03:42:22,375
like half a level lower than the rest.

5945
03:42:22,375 --> 03:42:23,818
ASHLEY: That would suck so much.

5946
03:42:23,818 --> 03:42:27,064
LIAM: When Pike died we had, all of us,

5947
03:42:27,064 --> 03:42:29,327
many series of dice rolls to do,

5948
03:42:29,327 --> 03:42:31,363
and it was very story-based.

5949
03:42:31,363 --> 03:42:33,247
MARISHA: Yeah people are asking how she came back.

5950
03:42:33,247 --> 03:42:36,696
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, luckily
we were in a big city,

5951
03:42:36,696 --> 03:42:37,836
there was a huge temple.

5952
03:42:37,836 --> 03:42:40,670
There were very wise clerics who were good

5953
03:42:40,670 --> 03:42:41,672
at bringing people back.

5954
03:42:41,672 --> 03:42:43,291
But still, we all had to roll.

5955
03:42:43,291 --> 03:42:45,451
There was three rounds we had to roll,

5956
03:42:45,451 --> 03:42:47,204
he might have fudged
numbers, I don't know.

5957
03:42:47,204 --> 03:42:49,621
But we were all still scared.

5958
03:42:51,117 --> 03:42:52,985
We had to all, the majority of us,

5959
03:42:52,985 --> 03:42:56,047
had to have good rolls
three times in a row.

5960
03:42:56,047 --> 03:42:57,181
Scanlan had to put--

5961
03:42:57,181 --> 03:42:58,646
TRAVIS: The tears of three women in the room.

5962
03:42:58,646 --> 03:43:01,601
LIAM: The tears, Scanlan had
to kiss her on the head,

5963
03:43:01,601 --> 03:43:03,254
he put a figure that he carved of her,

5964
03:43:03,254 --> 03:43:04,831
it was very elaborate.

5965
03:43:04,831 --> 03:43:07,777
This one was majorly in tears.

5966
03:43:07,777 --> 03:43:09,455
Laura was in tears.

5967
03:43:09,455 --> 03:43:10,865
ASHLEY: I was in tears.

5968
03:43:10,865 --> 03:43:12,479
TALIESIN: Laura was hyperventilating.

5969
03:43:12,479 --> 03:43:14,744
ORION: And when that was going on, I remember,

5970
03:43:14,744 --> 03:43:17,245
when that went off, being still Tiberius,

5971
03:43:17,245 --> 03:43:19,708
I was like in half character but half not,

5972
03:43:19,708 --> 03:43:22,945
and I was not crying,
I was like, (grumbles)

5973
03:43:22,945 --> 03:43:23,778
the whole time,

5974
03:43:23,778 --> 03:43:26,181
and as soon as she sprung back to life,

5975
03:43:26,181 --> 03:43:27,155
because the cleric--

5976
03:43:27,155 --> 03:43:29,183
MATT: Breathed in her first breath after that.

5977
03:43:29,183 --> 03:43:31,959
ORION: We luckily, because I
know it was a tight roll.

5978
03:43:31,959 --> 03:43:32,866
MATT: It was a very tight roll.

5979
03:43:32,866 --> 03:43:35,214
It was a DC of 14 in the final roll,

5980
03:43:35,214 --> 03:43:39,075
and because Scanlan brought
out this figure of her

5981
03:43:39,075 --> 03:43:41,720
that he had carved for her
like two months beforehand

5982
03:43:41,720 --> 03:43:44,015
as a gift, sets it down and
kisses her on the forehead,

5983
03:43:44,015 --> 03:43:47,116
and it was kinda the
final connection point.

5984
03:43:47,116 --> 03:43:51,116
He needed 14, he rolled
a 12, but, because he--

5985
03:43:54,129 --> 03:43:57,894
There's a plus two modifier to
the skill check, being a bard,

5986
03:43:57,894 --> 03:44:00,783
and that was what he
needed, he just made it.

5987
03:44:00,783 --> 03:44:01,928
Basic, basic--

5988
03:44:01,928 --> 03:44:03,530
LIAM: Someone's asking if we drink while playing,

5989
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:04,876
and the answer is no.

5990
03:44:04,876 --> 03:44:06,582
(all laugh)

5991
03:44:06,582 --> 03:44:07,915
TRAVIS: It's just water in those tankards.

5992
03:44:09,335 --> 03:44:10,978
TALIESIN: Coffee.

5993
03:44:14,674 --> 03:44:15,941
MARISHA: I almost did, yeah.

5994
03:44:15,941 --> 03:44:20,361
ORION: When she came back to
life is when Tiberius,

5995
03:44:20,361 --> 03:44:23,854
I was like, "oh my God, she's okay!"

5996
03:44:23,854 --> 03:44:26,343
ASHLEY: I think also having--

5997
03:44:26,343 --> 03:44:29,080
Because with magic and
everything like that,

5998
03:44:29,080 --> 03:44:31,881
just bringing somebody
back to life so easily,

5999
03:44:31,881 --> 03:44:36,048
since we don't have that as
much as maybe other games--

6000
03:44:37,184 --> 03:44:39,460
It's heightened, so every
time someone gets hurt,

6001
03:44:39,460 --> 03:44:42,180
we're all, I think now,
after having that death,

6002
03:44:42,180 --> 03:44:43,585
all of us are like, "where are you at?

6003
03:44:43,585 --> 03:44:44,524
"Where are you at?"

6004
03:44:44,524 --> 03:44:45,747
ORION: Where are you going?

6005
03:44:45,747 --> 03:44:48,848
I wish I could turn to
Sam, but he's not here.

6006
03:44:48,848 --> 03:44:52,160
ASHLEY: We're all so stressed out now, which is,

6007
03:44:52,160 --> 03:44:53,350
it's kinda cool.

6008
03:44:53,350 --> 03:44:55,514
MATT: Mortality's a real thing
you have to deal with,

6009
03:44:55,514 --> 03:44:57,122
and up until Pike's death it was kind of

6010
03:44:57,122 --> 03:44:59,262
a thing people weren't considering.

6011
03:44:59,262 --> 03:45:01,696
It just happened so suddenly.

6012
03:45:01,696 --> 03:45:03,993
LIAM: One I see keep coming up
since we started is

6013
03:45:03,993 --> 03:45:08,160
how would we react to life
if we were our characters?

6014
03:45:10,352 --> 03:45:12,305
I don't know, or differently
from our characters?

6015
03:45:12,305 --> 03:45:15,612
'Cause I wouldn't stab my
children when they frustrate me.

6016
03:45:15,612 --> 03:45:17,134
MATT: I'd be in a padded room.

6017
03:45:17,134 --> 03:45:19,551
(all laugh)

6018
03:45:19,551 --> 03:45:22,697
MARISHA: I feel like everyone
tries to make decisions

6019
03:45:22,697 --> 03:45:26,168
in a game that their character
would make in real life,

6020
03:45:26,168 --> 03:45:27,788
'cause that's kind of the point.

6021
03:45:27,788 --> 03:45:32,462
I take into consideration
that I have shitty charisma,

6022
03:45:32,462 --> 03:45:33,954
whenever I open my mouth.

6023
03:45:33,954 --> 03:45:36,429
I feel like we all try and
take into consideration

6024
03:45:36,429 --> 03:45:38,068
our background and our alignment,

6025
03:45:38,068 --> 03:45:39,566
because that's, you know.

6026
03:45:39,566 --> 03:45:41,736
TALIESIN: I feel significantly more
badass than my character.

6027
03:45:44,285 --> 03:45:45,202
ORION: I feel...

6028
03:45:47,460 --> 03:45:49,372
Tiberius is just me with magic.

6029
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:52,165
So that's how I feel.

6030
03:45:52,165 --> 03:45:53,770
TRAVIS: Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions,

6031
03:45:53,770 --> 03:45:56,103
which is just all that I do.

6032
03:45:58,767 --> 03:46:00,315
MATT: Pike died when they were fighting

6033
03:46:00,315 --> 03:46:01,492
what was called a treachery demon,

6034
03:46:01,492 --> 03:46:02,659
or a glabrezu,

6035
03:46:03,566 --> 03:46:07,384
which had basically infiltrated the

6036
03:46:07,384 --> 03:46:11,254
Sovereign Uriel, and the city of Emon.

6037
03:46:11,254 --> 03:46:12,821
And when it revealed its final form,

6038
03:46:12,821 --> 03:46:14,515
it got one lucky critical hit on Pike

6039
03:46:14,515 --> 03:46:17,798
when she was too close, and
just instantly took her out.

6040
03:46:17,798 --> 03:46:18,922
That's how she died.

6041
03:46:18,922 --> 03:46:21,203
Someone's asking if they can (laughs)

6042
03:46:21,203 --> 03:46:23,027
send us equipment we need for the show.

6043
03:46:23,027 --> 03:46:23,860
Zac.

6044
03:46:23,860 --> 03:46:24,768
ZAC: Yeah, they can.

6045
03:46:24,768 --> 03:46:25,601
MATT: What do you need?

6046
03:46:25,601 --> 03:46:26,555
ZAC: We'll put it on the wishlist.

6047
03:46:26,555 --> 03:46:27,610
MATT: There you go, it's on the wishlist.

6048
03:46:27,610 --> 03:46:28,479
ORION: There's a wishlist?

6049
03:46:28,479 --> 03:46:30,654
MATT: I didn't know there was
one, but now there is.

6050
03:46:30,654 --> 03:46:32,631
ZAC: Castle Greyskull on there.

6051
03:46:32,631 --> 03:46:35,798
LIAM: How do we feel about Team Demihooman,

6052
03:46:37,513 --> 03:46:40,570
and inspiring them to play
D&amp;D for the first time?

6053
03:46:40,570 --> 03:46:42,599
I think the number one
reason we all wanna do this

6054
03:46:42,599 --> 03:46:45,262
is because we love each
other, and we love this game.

6055
03:46:45,262 --> 03:46:46,999
The second thing is we all knew,

6056
03:46:46,999 --> 03:46:49,120
we kind of felt like--

6057
03:46:49,120 --> 03:46:52,446
We're gonna make Dungeons
&amp; Dragons cool again.

6058
03:46:52,446 --> 03:46:53,337
MATT: Try at least.

6059
03:46:54,394 --> 03:46:56,075
LIAM: And make it open for anyone to do,

6060
03:46:56,075 --> 03:46:58,175
there's no reason not to do this.

6061
03:46:58,175 --> 03:47:00,762
If there's someone you know
who doesn't understand it,

6062
03:47:00,762 --> 03:47:01,897
don't worry about it.

6063
03:47:01,897 --> 03:47:05,165
Just find some friends
and connect with them.

6064
03:47:05,165 --> 03:47:06,380
MATT: I find one of the difficult things

6065
03:47:06,380 --> 03:47:09,008
is explaining to somebody
who has never played an RPG,

6066
03:47:09,008 --> 03:47:11,216
or a game of D&amp;D at all, they're like,

6067
03:47:11,216 --> 03:47:13,280
"how does it work, what is it?"

6068
03:47:13,280 --> 03:47:15,652
And it's hard to explain, so if anything,

6069
03:47:15,652 --> 03:47:18,422
now we have an example with this show.

6070
03:47:18,422 --> 03:47:19,724
Other than the IT Crowd episode,

6071
03:47:19,724 --> 03:47:21,859
or the Community episode,

6072
03:47:21,859 --> 03:47:23,719
which are both great
examples for quick little

6073
03:47:23,719 --> 03:47:24,762
succinct things.

6074
03:47:24,762 --> 03:47:26,584
TALIESIN: If we had the power to
bring one guest player

6075
03:47:26,584 --> 03:47:27,417
for one session.

6076
03:47:27,417 --> 03:47:28,613
ORION: Oh, that's easy.

6077
03:47:28,613 --> 03:47:30,142
Tom Hanks, for sure.

6078
03:47:30,142 --> 03:47:32,708
(all laugh)

6079
03:47:32,708 --> 03:47:33,721
MARISHA: Mazes and Madness.

6080
03:47:33,721 --> 03:47:34,565
ZAC: Everyone is asking for you guys

6081
03:47:34,565 --> 03:47:35,820
to somehow get Vin Diesel.

6082
03:47:35,820 --> 03:47:37,375
MARISHA: I was gonna say, Vin Diesel.

6083
03:47:37,375 --> 03:47:38,422
ORION: He lives for this shit!

6084
03:47:38,422 --> 03:47:40,334
MATT: Vin Diesel's good.

6085
03:47:40,334 --> 03:47:42,042
Top of my list is Stephen Colbert,

6086
03:47:42,042 --> 03:47:43,914
because I know he also plays.

6087
03:47:43,914 --> 03:47:45,107
ASHLEY: That would be amazing.

6088
03:47:45,107 --> 03:47:47,939
TALIESIN: I would love to see Joss Whedon do this.

6089
03:47:47,939 --> 03:47:50,469
I admit I would like to
see Joss Whedon play D&amp;D.

6090
03:47:50,469 --> 03:47:52,020
That'd be interesting.

6091
03:47:53,530 --> 03:47:54,442
ZAC: That might be possible.

6092
03:47:54,442 --> 03:47:55,617
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm throwing that one out there.

6093
03:47:55,617 --> 03:47:56,985
ORION: What, Tom Hanks isn't?

6094
03:47:56,985 --> 03:47:58,223
MARISHA: Felicia's got some.

6095
03:47:59,315 --> 03:48:02,732
MATT: But he's also a super fuckin' busy man.

6096
03:48:04,042 --> 03:48:06,586
ORION: Guys, tweet at Tom Hanks
to come play with us.

6097
03:48:06,586 --> 03:48:09,062
TRAVIS: I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one.

6098
03:48:09,062 --> 03:48:11,812
MATT: Right now, Critical Role Hanks.

6099
03:48:13,108 --> 03:48:15,444
See if we can make it trend.

6100
03:48:15,444 --> 03:48:16,635
Patton Oswalt would be great.

6101
03:48:16,635 --> 03:48:18,429
ORION: That'd be hilarious.

6102
03:48:18,429 --> 03:48:19,936
ZAC: What about Dan Harmon,

6103
03:48:19,936 --> 03:48:21,585
just so I can get fired, can we do that?

6104
03:48:21,585 --> 03:48:23,437
(all laugh)

6105
03:48:23,437 --> 03:48:24,782
MATT: Yeah.

6106
03:48:24,782 --> 03:48:26,898
Hardwick used to play
D&amp;D with Patton Oswalt

6107
03:48:26,898 --> 03:48:28,534
in the mid-2000s.

6108
03:48:28,534 --> 03:48:29,974
I can't even imagine what
those games were like.

6109
03:48:29,974 --> 03:48:31,918
ORION: I'd like to like--

6110
03:48:31,918 --> 03:48:34,956
Amy Poehler, I'd like
to have one of those.

6111
03:48:34,956 --> 03:48:36,653
ZAC: She might be open to that.

6112
03:48:36,653 --> 03:48:38,523
She's a partner with Legendary.

6113
03:48:38,523 --> 03:48:41,883
ORION: I'd love her, Tina, Tina Fey.

6114
03:48:41,883 --> 03:48:43,160
LIAM: Someone keeps asking about Troy,

6115
03:48:43,160 --> 03:48:46,338
I don't know if Troy Baker is ready.

6116
03:48:47,854 --> 03:48:49,746
ORION: I don't think he's ready for this jelly.

6117
03:48:51,284 --> 03:48:52,280
You guys think he's ready for this jelly?

6118
03:48:52,280 --> 03:48:53,790
I don't think so.

6119
03:48:53,790 --> 03:48:54,891
MATT: Whenever it comes up in conversation,

6120
03:48:54,891 --> 03:48:57,044
Troy always gives me that look of like...

6121
03:48:57,044 --> 03:48:58,080
"All right."

6122
03:48:58,080 --> 03:49:01,147
TRAVIS: You can see him swimming
in the infinity of--

6123
03:49:01,147 --> 03:49:02,613
MARISHA: "That's not cool."

6124
03:49:02,613 --> 03:49:04,380
LIAM: He has some preconceived notions.

6125
03:49:04,380 --> 03:49:07,666
MARISHA: "My scarves are cooler than you."

6126
03:49:07,666 --> 03:49:09,306
MATT: Once we get him like a proper

6127
03:49:09,306 --> 03:49:10,505
plus two enchanted scarf.

6128
03:49:10,505 --> 03:49:12,528
ASHLEY: Can we ship Grog and Vex?

6129
03:49:12,528 --> 03:49:15,142
TRAVIS: Grog and Vex.

6130
03:49:15,142 --> 03:49:18,889
No, I'm here to annoy Vex
by smacking her bear around,

6131
03:49:18,889 --> 03:49:22,744
and she's here to tell
me not to kill myself.

6132
03:49:22,744 --> 03:49:25,484
"Don't jump into the crevasse,
it's 1000 feet deep."

6133
03:49:25,484 --> 03:49:27,442
ASHLEY: Troy Baker is Pike's distanced dad.

6134
03:49:27,442 --> 03:49:29,282
(all laugh)

6135
03:49:29,282 --> 03:49:31,245
MATT: That's pretty funny.

6136
03:49:31,245 --> 03:49:32,641
LIAM: Answer this question I like,

6137
03:49:32,641 --> 03:49:33,474
I saw it a couple times,

6138
03:49:33,474 --> 03:49:35,593
how did you guys get involved in streaming

6139
03:49:35,593 --> 03:49:37,093
for Geek &amp; Sundry?

6140
03:49:38,122 --> 03:49:39,023
TRAVIS: Virgin sacrifice.

6141
03:49:39,023 --> 03:49:41,137
MATT: The best way I know that happened was,

6142
03:49:41,137 --> 03:49:42,145
we had been playing for a while,

6143
03:49:42,145 --> 03:49:44,812
and we all work in the industry.

6144
03:49:46,040 --> 03:49:49,676
People began to hear about
our voiceover D&amp;D game,

6145
03:49:49,676 --> 03:49:50,509
weirdly.

6146
03:49:50,509 --> 03:49:51,540
Like I'd come into sessions with directors

6147
03:49:51,540 --> 03:49:52,814
I've never worked with
before, they'd be like,

6148
03:49:52,814 --> 03:49:55,277
"Oh yeah, you're the guy
that runs that D&amp;D game."

6149
03:49:55,277 --> 03:49:57,376
How did that happen? How is that my thing?

6150
03:49:57,376 --> 03:49:58,687
I'm cool with it, like heck yeah,

6151
03:49:58,687 --> 03:50:00,295
my little high school self is like,

6152
03:50:00,295 --> 03:50:02,635
I'm okay with being known about that.

6153
03:50:02,635 --> 03:50:06,530
But then over time eventually
Geek &amp; Sundry contacted us.

6154
03:50:06,530 --> 03:50:08,661
Felicia had heard about it.

6155
03:50:08,661 --> 03:50:10,003
They called me in for a meeting,

6156
03:50:10,003 --> 03:50:11,350
and we spent a number of months

6157
03:50:11,350 --> 03:50:12,937
trying to figure out what
format we were gonna try,

6158
03:50:12,937 --> 03:50:14,584
if we wanna do it like multi camera,

6159
03:50:14,584 --> 03:50:15,740
filmed canned episodes,

6160
03:50:15,740 --> 03:50:17,224
then eventually the Twitch
possibility came up,

6161
03:50:17,224 --> 03:50:18,057
and we were like no,

6162
03:50:18,057 --> 03:50:20,003
this is a much better format for us.

6163
03:50:20,003 --> 03:50:21,645
And that's kind of how it happened.

6164
03:50:21,645 --> 03:50:24,477
LIAM: Are you kosher with me,

6165
03:50:24,477 --> 03:50:26,494
you took this film, there's a video of you

6166
03:50:26,494 --> 03:50:28,462
breaking the news to us that Geek &amp; Sundry

6167
03:50:28,462 --> 03:50:29,482
came to you about it.

6168
03:50:29,482 --> 03:50:31,056
Are you kosher with me sharing that video?

6169
03:50:31,056 --> 03:50:32,108
MATT: Yeah, I don't see why not.

6170
03:50:32,108 --> 03:50:33,625
LIAM: All right, I'll find a way to put it

6171
03:50:33,625 --> 03:50:35,497
through my Twitter.

6172
03:50:35,497 --> 03:50:37,530
So just keep your eye on my Twitter.

6173
03:50:37,530 --> 03:50:38,549
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you sharing?

6174
03:50:38,549 --> 03:50:40,445
LIAM: There was a video that Orion took

6175
03:50:40,445 --> 03:50:45,018
when Matt told us about
Geek &amp; Sundry coming to him.

6176
03:50:45,018 --> 03:50:48,788
And us all sort of toasting and laughing.

6177
03:50:48,788 --> 03:50:49,621
ORION: Reacting.

6178
03:50:49,621 --> 03:50:51,538
LIAM: Giggling like idiots.

6179
03:50:52,503 --> 03:50:54,173
MATT: Why is D&amp;D Pathfinder
making you so much more

6180
03:50:54,173 --> 03:50:55,962
attached to the characters
than a regular RPG?

6181
03:50:55,962 --> 03:50:57,830
If you mean like a video game RPG?

6182
03:50:57,830 --> 03:50:59,661
I mean you get attached either way,

6183
03:50:59,661 --> 03:51:02,139
but with this, because you
are so much more fluid,

6184
03:51:02,139 --> 03:51:03,820
with how you can influence the world,

6185
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:05,880
and the character, and the
way the character reacts

6186
03:51:05,880 --> 03:51:10,006
to the world and how it can
influence it is so much more--

6187
03:51:10,006 --> 03:51:10,839
MARISHA: Personal.

6188
03:51:10,839 --> 03:51:13,296
MATT: Personal, a good way of putting it.

6189
03:51:13,296 --> 03:51:14,489
It's just that much more involving,

6190
03:51:14,489 --> 03:51:17,056
and you invest so much
into that atmosphere.

6191
03:51:17,056 --> 03:51:18,431
And it depends on the group,

6192
03:51:18,431 --> 03:51:19,841
some people just like to do dungeon crawls,

6193
03:51:19,841 --> 03:51:21,179
and kill and get loot and experience,

6194
03:51:21,179 --> 03:51:23,512
and that's totally cool too.

6195
03:51:24,392 --> 03:51:25,486
For me at least.

6196
03:51:25,486 --> 03:51:27,982
I like 'em both for different reasons.

6197
03:51:27,982 --> 03:51:30,443
I still play the crap
out of video game RPGs.

6198
03:51:30,443 --> 03:51:32,690
LIAM: Someone asked if given the chance,

6199
03:51:32,690 --> 03:51:35,273
would we like to do a live game

6200
03:51:37,264 --> 03:51:40,807
at a convention like Acquisition Inc.?

6201
03:51:40,807 --> 03:51:43,081
I'd like to do, although
there's nine of us,

6202
03:51:43,081 --> 03:51:44,360
so that'd be kind of--

6203
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:45,775
ASHLEY: That'd be a long game.

6204
03:51:45,775 --> 03:51:49,032
ZAC: We may be asking
you guys to do that soon.

6205
03:51:49,032 --> 03:51:50,187
LIAM: Oh good, then yes.

6206
03:51:50,187 --> 03:51:52,566
MATT: As long as you're handling the tech,

6207
03:51:52,566 --> 03:51:54,173
I think we'd be fine with that.

6208
03:51:54,173 --> 03:51:55,283
LIAM: I'd like to do it.

6209
03:51:55,283 --> 03:51:57,850
ZAC: We may be streaming from Comic Con,

6210
03:51:57,850 --> 03:51:58,793
I don't know.

6211
03:51:58,793 --> 03:52:00,313
We may be asking if you guys are gonna

6212
03:52:00,313 --> 03:52:02,248
go through that hell hole.

6213
03:52:03,503 --> 03:52:05,037
LIAM: The answer is yes.

6214
03:52:05,037 --> 03:52:07,870
ORION: Can we get a jib? I like crane shots.

6215
03:52:07,870 --> 03:52:08,758
MARISHA: Ooh.

6216
03:52:10,156 --> 03:52:11,872
ASHLEY: A helicopter? A helicopter shot.

6217
03:52:11,872 --> 03:52:12,712
ORION: Put it on the wishlist.

6218
03:52:12,712 --> 03:52:14,433
ZAC: Put it on the wishlist, a jib.

6219
03:52:17,131 --> 03:52:18,623
LIAM: How many of you aside from Matt

6220
03:52:18,623 --> 03:52:21,790
have run a game of D&amp;D or another RPG?

6221
03:52:22,778 --> 03:52:25,580
In high school I ran a D&amp;D game,

6222
03:52:25,580 --> 03:52:28,498
I ran a Rifts game for a little while.

6223
03:52:28,498 --> 03:52:29,581
MATT: Rifts, yes.

6224
03:52:30,715 --> 03:52:33,802
LIAM: I ran a cyberpunk game
for a little while.

6225
03:52:33,802 --> 03:52:34,635
TRAVIS: Really?

6226
03:52:34,635 --> 03:52:35,468
LIAM: Yes.

6227
03:52:36,804 --> 03:52:39,274
The last two months I have been helping

6228
03:52:39,274 --> 03:52:41,127
my eight-year-old son
and two of his friends

6229
03:52:41,127 --> 03:52:42,692
from school create characters.

6230
03:52:42,692 --> 03:52:45,707
And I wouldn't have done this if Matt

6231
03:52:45,707 --> 03:52:48,382
had not forced this shit into my life.

6232
03:52:48,382 --> 03:52:49,544
I wouldn't have done this,

6233
03:52:49,544 --> 03:52:52,350
but I'm about to start
running a game for my son,

6234
03:52:52,350 --> 03:52:54,768
the half-elf druid, and his two friends,

6235
03:52:54,768 --> 03:52:58,771
the dragonborn fighter,
and the dragonborn rogue.

6236
03:52:58,771 --> 03:53:00,168
TRAVIS: What if they die?

6237
03:53:00,168 --> 03:53:02,106
LIAM: That's just how the cookie
crumbles, motherfucker.

6238
03:53:02,106 --> 03:53:04,213
TRAVIS: Oh man, you are teaching life lessons.

6239
03:53:04,213 --> 03:53:05,264
MARISHA: Gotta teach lessons.

6240
03:53:05,264 --> 03:53:06,293
TRAVIS: Go Fish and then D&amp;D.

6241
03:53:06,293 --> 03:53:10,651
TALIESIN: I ran a Rifts game as well in high school.

6242
03:53:10,651 --> 03:53:14,615
Then I ran a game of
Vampire the Masquerade,

6243
03:53:14,615 --> 03:53:16,459
and I was in a bunch of them.

6244
03:53:16,459 --> 03:53:17,938
LIAM: Of course you did.

6245
03:53:17,938 --> 03:53:21,061
TALIESIN: Couple rounds of Paranoia, and Hole,

6246
03:53:21,061 --> 03:53:22,525
because that's funny.

6247
03:53:22,525 --> 03:53:23,510
Hole was amazing.

6248
03:53:23,510 --> 03:53:24,454
MATT: Which you gave me books for.

6249
03:53:24,454 --> 03:53:25,939
For my birthday, which was awesome.

6250
03:53:25,939 --> 03:53:28,467
MARISHA: I was a part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer

6251
03:53:28,467 --> 03:53:30,388
tabletop RPG for a while.

6252
03:53:30,388 --> 03:53:32,566
Yeah, it's actually quite fun.

6253
03:53:32,566 --> 03:53:34,149
I was a pyromancer.

6254
03:53:35,532 --> 03:53:39,183
ORION: Somebody asked a fun one,
they asked if we play,

6255
03:53:39,183 --> 03:53:41,766
what's our favorite video game?

6256
03:53:42,813 --> 03:53:44,024
MARISHA: What's our favorite video games?

6257
03:53:44,024 --> 03:53:45,802
Oh that's a hard question.

6258
03:53:45,802 --> 03:53:46,635
ORION: Is it?

6259
03:53:46,635 --> 03:53:47,972
MARISHA: There's so many!

6260
03:53:47,972 --> 03:53:48,935
ORION: Well we can skip it.

6261
03:53:48,935 --> 03:53:51,323
LIAM: Metal Gear, Dragon Age.

6262
03:53:51,323 --> 03:53:53,451
ASHLEY: Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.

6263
03:53:53,451 --> 03:53:54,352
MATT: Portal's great.

6264
03:53:54,352 --> 03:53:55,900
LIAM: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night,

6265
03:53:55,900 --> 03:53:57,553
I played 'til I had blisters on my thumbs.

6266
03:53:57,553 --> 03:53:59,253
MATT: Symphony of the Night, yeah, dude.

6267
03:53:59,253 --> 03:54:00,086
What is a man?

6268
03:54:00,086 --> 03:54:01,274
TALIESIN: Borderlands 2, and I'm happy--

6269
03:54:01,274 --> 03:54:03,605
ASHLEY: Borderlands 2.

6270
03:54:03,605 --> 03:54:06,924
LIAM: Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64.

6271
03:54:06,924 --> 03:54:07,817
ORION: Oh shit.

6272
03:54:07,817 --> 03:54:10,742
LIAM: Baldur's Gate, which I
played again on my iPad

6273
03:54:10,742 --> 03:54:12,242
a year or two ago.

6274
03:54:13,458 --> 03:54:15,331
Somebody, oh go ahead.

6275
03:54:15,331 --> 03:54:17,040
ORION: I was just saying.

6276
03:54:17,040 --> 03:54:19,866
LIAM: Somebody asked how we focus in the room

6277
03:54:19,866 --> 03:54:23,323
with the sexual magnetism
that is Scanlan Shorthalt.

6278
03:54:23,323 --> 03:54:24,651
ASHLEY: Ooh, it's tough man.

6279
03:54:24,651 --> 03:54:25,484
LIAM: I don't know.

6280
03:54:25,484 --> 03:54:26,317
TALIESIN: I wear a codpiece.

6281
03:54:26,317 --> 03:54:28,238
I wear a codpiece that
keeps everything in check.

6282
03:54:28,238 --> 03:54:29,832
MATT: I'm heavily sedated most of the game,

6283
03:54:29,832 --> 03:54:31,102
just for that reason.

6284
03:54:31,102 --> 03:54:32,840
Otherwise the clothes
would just come right off.

6285
03:54:32,840 --> 03:54:35,657
LIAM: I just let myself get a
gigantic boner every week.

6286
03:54:37,591 --> 03:54:39,248
MATT: Does anyone play League?

6287
03:54:39,248 --> 03:54:40,530
Generally.
MARISHA: Sometimes.

6288
03:54:40,530 --> 03:54:42,686
We're playing Heroes
of the Storm more now.

6289
03:54:42,686 --> 03:54:44,229
ORION: I'm a big Final Fantasy fan.

6290
03:54:44,229 --> 03:54:45,922
I like all kinds of games.

6291
03:54:45,922 --> 03:54:49,382
I definitely would say
if I had to pick one RPG,

6292
03:54:49,382 --> 03:54:51,422
cause I'm an RPG guy, I love Chrono Cross,

6293
03:54:51,422 --> 03:54:52,323
that'd be my favorite game.

6294
03:54:52,323 --> 03:54:55,142
I've played that more than
I have Chrono Trigger,

6295
03:54:55,142 --> 03:54:56,338
which is way too many times.

6296
03:54:56,338 --> 03:54:59,255
TRAVIS: Dragon Age race/class.

6297
03:55:00,516 --> 03:55:02,494
Ash, anybody that plays?

6298
03:55:02,494 --> 03:55:03,435
MATT: Elf rogue.

6299
03:55:03,435 --> 03:55:04,829
TALIESIN: Human fighter.

6300
03:55:04,829 --> 03:55:06,372
TRAVIS: Always the mage.

6301
03:55:06,372 --> 03:55:08,821
LIAM: Travis, stupid question, Thor, Odinson,

6302
03:55:08,821 --> 03:55:10,914
or Hulk, in a knock down drag out?

6303
03:55:10,914 --> 03:55:12,274
TRAVIS: Oh (scoffs).

6304
03:55:12,274 --> 03:55:13,895
ORION: Type-0 also, dammit.

6305
03:55:13,895 --> 03:55:16,757
TRAVIS: Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk.

6306
03:55:19,617 --> 03:55:22,269
I mean I am Thor, I
can't say any other guy.

6307
03:55:22,269 --> 03:55:23,835
TALIESIN: Hulk's on a scaling power level,

6308
03:55:23,835 --> 03:55:25,685
'cause he just gets too mad.

6309
03:55:25,685 --> 03:55:28,650
TRAVIS: Yeah let's just be real about that.

6310
03:55:28,650 --> 03:55:30,209
That's Hulk.

6311
03:55:30,209 --> 03:55:31,657
MATT: Tried new Final Fantasy yet?

6312
03:55:31,657 --> 03:55:35,157
ASHLEY: ChocolateSweets a bunch of times has asked

6313
03:55:35,157 --> 03:55:38,209
would you guys consider
cosplay for the games?

6314
03:55:38,209 --> 03:55:40,340
TALIESIN: Well technically.

6315
03:55:40,340 --> 03:55:41,194
We already did.

6316
03:55:41,194 --> 03:55:43,694
MARISHA: You'll see, maybe next week?

6317
03:55:44,717 --> 03:55:45,886
MATT: He's trying the best he can.

6318
03:55:45,886 --> 03:55:48,728
We have an intro coming
up some point soon.

6319
03:55:48,728 --> 03:55:49,713
ZAC: Halfway done.

6320
03:55:49,713 --> 03:55:54,266
MATT: Halfway done, we all shot
loosely in character costumes

6321
03:55:54,266 --> 03:55:55,622
inspired by everyone's characters,

6322
03:55:55,622 --> 03:55:56,937
so you'll be able to see that soon.

6323
03:55:56,937 --> 03:55:59,514
TALIESIN: If anyone would like to make us costumes.

6324
03:55:59,514 --> 03:56:01,650
LIAM: One man doing it all.

6325
03:56:01,650 --> 03:56:03,067
TRAVIS: A million arms.

6326
03:56:08,768 --> 03:56:10,413
ASHLEY: I think it would be kinda hard for me

6327
03:56:10,413 --> 03:56:12,785
to play the game in cosplay,

6328
03:56:12,785 --> 03:56:15,408
'cause I have probably the most armor now.

6329
03:56:15,408 --> 03:56:16,420
MATT: You do.

6330
03:56:16,420 --> 03:56:17,412
You wear the most armor.

6331
03:56:18,396 --> 03:56:19,841
ORION: That's a cool question.

6332
03:56:19,841 --> 03:56:21,754
If you had to switch characters Matt,

6333
03:56:21,754 --> 03:56:23,466
if you had to switch characters,

6334
03:56:23,466 --> 03:56:25,383
which one would you be?

6335
03:56:26,637 --> 03:56:28,667
MARISHA: If you had to trade places with one of us?

6336
03:56:28,667 --> 03:56:30,822
ORION: Yeah, if you would switch characters.

6337
03:56:30,822 --> 03:56:31,655
ZAC: That question was Matt included,

6338
03:56:31,655 --> 03:56:32,488
question was for everyone,

6339
03:56:32,488 --> 03:56:34,448
if you guys could switch
characters with anyone,

6340
03:56:34,448 --> 03:56:35,281
who would you pick?

6341
03:56:35,281 --> 03:56:36,531
Including Matt.

6342
03:56:38,043 --> 03:56:41,876
ASHLEY: I would probably switch
with Liam or Travis.

6343
03:56:43,189 --> 03:56:46,864
TALIESIN: Tiberius would be mine, I'd take Tiberius.

6344
03:56:46,864 --> 03:56:49,197
LIAM: Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.

6345
03:56:49,197 --> 03:56:51,068
MATT: I would be Scanlan, bards man.

6346
03:56:51,068 --> 03:56:52,278
Bards are my favorite class.

6347
03:56:52,278 --> 03:56:54,757
MARISHA: I'd be probably either Scanlan or Pike.

6348
03:56:54,757 --> 03:56:55,842
TRAVIS: I'd be Trinket.

6349
03:56:57,455 --> 03:56:58,380
MATT: Yeah you would.

6350
03:57:00,421 --> 03:57:01,806
TRAVIS: Why are you peeing on everything?

6351
03:57:01,806 --> 03:57:03,468
MARISHA: Bards and clerics are great.

6352
03:57:03,468 --> 03:57:05,346
ORION: I'd definitely be Grog.

6353
03:57:05,346 --> 03:57:08,759
Just the complete
opposite of what I can do.

6354
03:57:08,759 --> 03:57:11,782
TALIESIN: I'm a WoW player on occasion,
I haven't played in ages.

6355
03:57:11,782 --> 03:57:13,115
ORION: For the Horde.

6356
03:57:15,776 --> 03:57:17,360
MATT: Player wants to play a lizardfolk monk,

6357
03:57:17,360 --> 03:57:18,911
what's my opinion about the idea?

6358
03:57:18,911 --> 03:57:19,999
That's fine, I mean a player can play

6359
03:57:19,999 --> 03:57:20,832
whatever they want to,

6360
03:57:20,832 --> 03:57:22,885
as long as you as the DM
want it in your campaign.

6361
03:57:22,885 --> 03:57:24,842
Just make sure they have
more to their character

6362
03:57:24,842 --> 03:57:27,754
besides "I'm a lizard monk!"

6363
03:57:27,754 --> 03:57:29,250
have a good reason why
they trained as a monk.

6364
03:57:29,250 --> 03:57:31,340
If they make a cool personality behind it,

6365
03:57:31,340 --> 03:57:32,565
work it into the social structure

6366
03:57:32,565 --> 03:57:34,209
of their lizardfolk people,

6367
03:57:34,209 --> 03:57:36,389
and see whether the monks
will be shunned or accepted,

6368
03:57:36,389 --> 03:57:38,068
are they an outcast of the society?

6369
03:57:38,068 --> 03:57:39,011
Think of those ideas,

6370
03:57:39,011 --> 03:57:40,846
and make a cool character
based on the story,

6371
03:57:40,846 --> 03:57:41,952
from a fighting standpoint?

6372
03:57:41,952 --> 03:57:43,112
That'd be cool.

6373
03:57:43,112 --> 03:57:44,736
I used to play a

6374
03:57:44,736 --> 03:57:48,703
lizard monk in Ruins of Kunark
back in the old EQ days.

6375
03:57:48,703 --> 03:57:50,529
Oh man.

6376
03:57:50,529 --> 03:57:51,362
That was a while back.

6377
03:57:51,362 --> 03:57:53,699
LIAM: Someone asked when
Trinket came into the mix.

6378
03:57:53,699 --> 03:57:54,532
Day one.

6379
03:57:54,532 --> 03:57:55,365
TRAVIS: Day one.

6380
03:57:55,365 --> 03:57:57,614
She had that shit like that.

6381
03:57:57,614 --> 03:57:59,473
She knew she wanted a pet bear.

6382
03:57:59,473 --> 03:58:01,296
MARISHA: He hasn't died yet.

6383
03:58:01,296 --> 03:58:02,427
ORION: He hasn't died, it's amazing,

6384
03:58:02,427 --> 03:58:04,368
this thing has not died.

6385
03:58:04,368 --> 03:58:05,375
He should have died so many times.

6386
03:58:05,375 --> 03:58:06,619
MATT: She spent all of her character focus

6387
03:58:06,619 --> 03:58:08,441
in having a pet from combat,

6388
03:58:08,441 --> 03:58:09,563
and then never puts it in combat,

6389
03:58:09,563 --> 03:58:11,485
because she doesn't want it to get killed,

6390
03:58:11,485 --> 03:58:12,995
and it's fucking hilarious.

6391
03:58:12,995 --> 03:58:14,965
TRAVIS: We put it jeopardy situations before.

6392
03:58:14,965 --> 03:58:16,190
MATT: Yeah, you have.

6393
03:58:16,190 --> 03:58:17,497
Every time she goes, "never again!"

6394
03:58:17,497 --> 03:58:20,217
And I'm like, all right, well.

6395
03:58:20,217 --> 03:58:22,697
TALIESIN: The day that bear dies,
it's gonna get ugly.

6396
03:58:22,697 --> 03:58:23,628
ASHLEY: It's gonna be bad.

6397
03:58:23,628 --> 03:58:27,347
ORION: It's good to change her, as a character.

6398
03:58:27,347 --> 03:58:28,947
TRAVIS: Alignment shift.

6399
03:58:28,947 --> 03:58:30,497
TALIESIN: So much black to wear.

6400
03:58:30,497 --> 03:58:33,199
MARISHA: Douginator asked me a
super detailed question.

6401
03:58:33,199 --> 03:58:35,885
So I don't wanna blow over
it, 'cause it was awesome.

6402
03:58:35,885 --> 03:58:39,289
He asked me how my path has gone,

6403
03:58:39,289 --> 03:58:42,020
and my personal Aramente journey,

6404
03:58:42,020 --> 03:58:44,471
and how working with the group has helped

6405
03:58:44,471 --> 03:58:46,070
and slowed it down.

6406
03:58:46,070 --> 03:58:49,602
For the Air Ashari and
for Keyleth's journey,

6407
03:58:49,602 --> 03:58:53,271
it's kind of expected
to take her maybe ten,

6408
03:58:53,271 --> 03:58:55,090
maybe 20 years?

6409
03:58:55,090 --> 03:58:57,673
It takes her like, the
Aramente is expected

6410
03:58:57,673 --> 03:58:59,097
to take a long time,

6411
03:58:59,097 --> 03:59:01,513
and part of it is her kind
of proving herself a hero.

6412
03:59:01,513 --> 03:59:04,135
So she kind of ended up tagging along

6413
03:59:04,135 --> 03:59:06,885
with this motley crew in order to

6414
03:59:08,272 --> 03:59:11,280
kind of help her so
she's not doing it alone.

6415
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:13,726
So it's a good thing
that she's tagging along.

6416
03:59:13,726 --> 03:59:17,249
But she also has to deal
with sometimes the moral

6417
03:59:17,249 --> 03:59:21,083
dilemma of maybe choices that she might

6418
03:59:21,083 --> 03:59:23,454
not normally make if she
wasn't with the group

6419
03:59:23,454 --> 03:59:25,574
that she has to go with.

6420
03:59:25,574 --> 03:59:28,124
LIAM: I see two questions I wanna address.

6421
03:59:28,124 --> 03:59:30,896
One is what is each of our favorite kill?

6422
03:59:30,896 --> 03:59:32,445
ORION: I was gonna say that was a good one.

6423
03:59:32,445 --> 03:59:35,408
LIAM: And the second one is
what's the story behind

6424
03:59:35,408 --> 03:59:37,266
the Super High Intensity Team?

6425
03:59:37,266 --> 03:59:39,662
(all laugh)

6426
03:59:39,662 --> 03:59:40,585
LIAM: Let's start with the kills,

6427
03:59:40,585 --> 03:59:42,722
and then we'll get to the SHITs.

6428
03:59:42,722 --> 03:59:46,889
My favorite kill, I finished
off a blue dragon we faced.

6429
03:59:48,527 --> 03:59:51,562
We all chipped away at this dragon,

6430
03:59:51,562 --> 03:59:54,939
someone who had disguised himself as human

6431
03:59:54,939 --> 03:59:59,106
for a long time, then we came
to their secret cubbyhole,

6432
04:00:00,044 --> 04:00:01,561
and they revealed themselves.

6433
04:00:01,561 --> 04:00:02,802
We chipped away and chipped away,

6434
04:00:02,802 --> 04:00:07,117
then at the end I sort
of parkour-ran up a wall

6435
04:00:07,117 --> 04:00:09,280
and shoved the daggers into its neck,

6436
04:00:09,280 --> 04:00:13,447
and just slid down its
entire body and finished it.

6437
04:00:14,979 --> 04:00:17,487
ORION: My favorite kill is actually--

6438
04:00:17,487 --> 04:00:18,320
LIAM: Until today.

6439
04:00:18,320 --> 04:00:20,580
ORION: When Pike kicked the bucket,

6440
04:00:20,580 --> 04:00:24,100
and that moment all of us
realized what happened,

6441
04:00:24,100 --> 04:00:27,440
and there was an instant
shift in real emotion,

6442
04:00:27,440 --> 04:00:29,395
where whatever the hell,

6443
04:00:29,395 --> 04:00:30,783
I don't even remember
who we were fighting,

6444
04:00:30,783 --> 04:00:33,220
because I went like, fucking cast this,

6445
04:00:33,220 --> 04:00:35,601
and everyone's just, kill this thing,

6446
04:00:35,601 --> 04:00:39,630
because we all cared so much
in a real life situation,

6447
04:00:39,630 --> 04:00:43,668
where we hated this
thing, with real emotion,

6448
04:00:43,668 --> 04:00:45,984
and we just slaughtered it.

6449
04:00:45,984 --> 04:00:49,214
TALIESIN: The demon-possessed royal
family was my favorite.

6450
04:00:49,214 --> 04:00:50,261
LIAM: That was the same thing.

6451
04:00:50,261 --> 04:00:52,118
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was my favorite fight.

6452
04:00:52,118 --> 04:00:54,238
Just using the light,
also we were shooting,

6453
04:00:54,238 --> 04:00:56,502
I was getting to shoot
holes in the glass.

6454
04:00:56,502 --> 04:00:58,508
MATT: The entire throne room
had a glass dome overtop,

6455
04:00:58,508 --> 04:01:00,980
but because the family had been possessed

6456
04:01:00,980 --> 04:01:03,900
by the shades, these shadow entities,

6457
04:01:03,900 --> 04:01:05,626
it was all covered.

6458
04:01:05,626 --> 04:01:07,500
They were able to force these spirits

6459
04:01:07,500 --> 04:01:09,713
out of the physical bodies
without killing them

6460
04:01:09,713 --> 04:01:11,571
by being able to tear off the cloth

6461
04:01:11,571 --> 04:01:13,372
or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in

6462
04:01:13,372 --> 04:01:14,667
and use that as part of the battle tactic,

6463
04:01:14,667 --> 04:01:15,601
it worked out really cool.

6464
04:01:15,601 --> 04:01:16,692
MARISHA: Yeah, that was fun.

6465
04:01:16,692 --> 04:01:18,113
TRAVIS: My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy,

6466
04:01:18,113 --> 04:01:19,954
it was when Scanlan summoned that pony,

6467
04:01:19,954 --> 04:01:21,817
when we were facing those five wizards.

6468
04:01:21,817 --> 04:01:22,893
(all laugh)

6469
04:01:22,893 --> 04:01:23,844
TRAVIS: He summoned this pony,

6470
04:01:23,844 --> 04:01:27,029
and then I turned and abruptly
cut its fucking head off,

6471
04:01:27,029 --> 04:01:29,099
and reached in and grabbed its organs,

6472
04:01:29,099 --> 04:01:31,412
and smeared its gore all over myself,

6473
04:01:31,412 --> 04:01:32,892
and started screaming.

6474
04:01:34,237 --> 04:01:36,570
And Mercer was like, "okay."

6475
04:01:38,223 --> 04:01:39,056
ORION: The fight ended there.

6476
04:01:39,056 --> 04:01:41,889
MATT: Roll intimidation, with a bonus.

6477
04:01:44,481 --> 04:01:46,687
TRAVIS: Butchered a pony for intimidation.

6478
04:01:46,687 --> 04:01:48,162
MATT: Yeah, it worked.

6479
04:01:48,162 --> 04:01:50,737
MARISHA: I think one of my
favorite Keyleth moments,

6480
04:01:50,737 --> 04:01:52,751
it wasn't a kill,

6481
04:01:52,751 --> 04:01:56,812
but when we were in the
crazy, Michael Jackson,

6482
04:01:56,812 --> 04:02:01,505
Neverland Ranch, sorcerer
dude's plane of existence.

6483
04:02:01,505 --> 04:02:03,009
MATT: The Dread Emperor.

6484
04:02:03,009 --> 04:02:04,965
MARISHA: Yeah, when we were in
his plane of existence,

6485
04:02:04,965 --> 04:02:08,858
and we encountered that
big tree rock monster,

6486
04:02:08,858 --> 04:02:11,246
and I just happened to
take Command Plants,

6487
04:02:11,246 --> 04:02:13,279
and he happened to be a plant monster,

6488
04:02:13,279 --> 04:02:14,629
so it just worked out perfectly,

6489
04:02:14,629 --> 04:02:17,043
and I was just like, "we
don't wanna fight you!

6490
04:02:17,043 --> 04:02:18,575
"back down."

6491
04:02:18,575 --> 04:02:20,516
and avoided an entire battle.

6492
04:02:20,516 --> 04:02:22,714
TALIESIN: Getting the magic carpet
was also pretty badass.

6493
04:02:22,714 --> 04:02:25,660
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that was a good story.

6494
04:02:25,660 --> 04:02:29,111
LIAM: Another fabulous moment that
you guys have to know about

6495
04:02:29,111 --> 04:02:33,687
is we wanted to get into
a tower at one point,

6496
04:02:33,687 --> 04:02:36,436
and there was a very intelligent sort of

6497
04:02:36,436 --> 04:02:39,540
right-hand man to whoever owned the tower.

6498
04:02:39,540 --> 04:02:41,502
Scanlan just started fast-talking,

6499
04:02:41,502 --> 04:02:43,681
which is his defining characteristic.

6500
04:02:43,681 --> 04:02:46,012
Took his finger and put it
right here as a mustache,

6501
04:02:46,012 --> 04:02:48,470
and said, "hi, I'm Burt Reynolds."

6502
04:02:48,470 --> 04:02:50,152
(all laugh)

6503
04:02:50,152 --> 04:02:53,402
LIAM: And he rolled, either
Scanlan rolled a 20--

6504
04:02:53,402 --> 04:02:55,214
TRAVIS: I think it was a natural.

6505
04:02:55,214 --> 04:02:56,735
MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

6506
04:02:56,735 --> 04:02:58,369
LIAM: And you weren't expecting it to work,

6507
04:02:58,369 --> 04:03:00,864
in any way, shape, or form, and you went,

6508
04:03:00,864 --> 04:03:01,697
"okay."

6509
04:03:02,905 --> 04:03:04,723
TRAVIS: Mr. Reynolds.

6510
04:03:04,723 --> 04:03:06,398
MARISHA: Burt Reynolds just announced that he's

6511
04:03:06,398 --> 04:03:08,767
gonna be at Philly Wizard World with us,

6512
04:03:08,767 --> 04:03:11,391
so we could theoretically
tell him that story.

6513
04:03:11,391 --> 04:03:12,391
MATT: I have to.

6514
04:03:13,433 --> 04:03:15,382
ASHLEY: Burt Reynolds would be a dream guest.

6515
04:03:17,232 --> 04:03:18,327
ORION: Him and Tom Hanks.

6516
04:03:18,327 --> 04:03:20,339
TRAVIS: He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet.

6517
04:03:20,339 --> 04:03:23,422
MATT: The whole family history organized.

6518
04:03:24,572 --> 04:03:26,687
ASHLEY: I've only had one kill.

6519
04:03:26,687 --> 04:03:28,105
TRAVIS: But, it was what?

6520
04:03:28,105 --> 04:03:29,519
ASHLEY: And it was a dragon.

6521
04:03:29,519 --> 04:03:30,873
TRAVIS: Yeah, dragonslayer.

6522
04:03:30,873 --> 04:03:33,235
ASHLEY: But the thing that I,

6523
04:03:33,235 --> 04:03:37,249
probably the whole battle with the family

6524
04:03:37,249 --> 04:03:39,695
that was sort of possessed
when I actually died,

6525
04:03:39,695 --> 04:03:42,571
that was probably one
of my favorite battles.

6526
04:03:42,571 --> 04:03:45,321
Maybe not after I died, prior to.

6527
04:03:47,311 --> 04:03:50,002
When I got to finish off the dragon--

6528
04:03:50,002 --> 04:03:52,038
TALIESIN: Was that on Christmas?

6529
04:03:52,038 --> 04:03:53,946
ASHLEY: The dragon? Yes.

6530
04:03:53,946 --> 04:03:57,491
That night was so amazing because we had,

6531
04:03:57,491 --> 04:03:59,672
we made it a winter festival.

6532
04:03:59,672 --> 04:04:02,172
So we all came in our pajamas.

6533
04:04:04,460 --> 04:04:06,746
It was close to Christmas,

6534
04:04:06,746 --> 04:04:07,967
that's why it was a winter festival.

6535
04:04:07,967 --> 04:04:10,171
It was like our little Christmas party.

6536
04:04:10,171 --> 04:04:11,121
MARISHA: Our holiday episode.

6537
04:04:11,121 --> 04:04:13,523
LIAM: That was sad for me because it was my idea

6538
04:04:13,523 --> 04:04:15,204
but I had health problems at the time

6539
04:04:15,204 --> 04:04:16,448
and I had to bow out,

6540
04:04:16,448 --> 04:04:18,595
and I was very, very, very sad.

6541
04:04:18,595 --> 04:04:20,235
MATT: But you made it to this year's.

6542
04:04:20,235 --> 04:04:23,009
I made it the following year, yeah.

6543
04:04:23,009 --> 04:04:25,008
TALIESIN: Yeah, we had a whole little
thing, it was really nice.

6544
04:04:25,008 --> 04:04:29,117
MATT: I would love to play D&amp;D
with Dame Judy Dench.

6545
04:04:29,117 --> 04:04:29,950
MARISHA: Heck yeah.

6546
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:31,976
MATT: You guys can tweet at her
so you can get her to agree.

6547
04:04:31,976 --> 04:04:32,809
LIAM: The SHITs.

6548
04:04:32,809 --> 04:04:33,690
How did we become the SHITs?

6549
04:04:33,690 --> 04:04:35,202
MATT: Yes.

6550
04:04:35,202 --> 04:04:37,535
So the party had run into a,

6551
04:04:39,038 --> 04:04:42,329
debearded, actually, shaven
dwarf named Grimthorn,

6552
04:04:42,329 --> 04:04:44,039
who wanted to represent them for,

6553
04:04:44,039 --> 04:04:47,801
what is occasionally, a
roving brawling guild,

6554
04:04:47,801 --> 04:04:48,700
essentially.

6555
04:04:48,700 --> 04:04:50,809
Like underground fighting
rings that happen

6556
04:04:50,809 --> 04:04:53,001
around the world at different
points throughout the year.

6557
04:04:53,001 --> 04:04:55,643
It may come up again, we'll see.

6558
04:04:55,643 --> 04:04:59,156
But they had to think of a team name.

6559
04:04:59,156 --> 04:05:00,613
And Scanlan.

6560
04:05:01,621 --> 04:05:03,638
Recommended the Super
High Intensity Team.

6561
04:05:03,638 --> 04:05:07,305
Which stuck for a while,
so the group name,

6562
04:05:07,305 --> 04:05:09,408
against the better judgement of, I think,

6563
04:05:09,408 --> 04:05:12,605
a lot of the group, became The SHITs.

6564
04:05:12,605 --> 04:05:13,969
So their name for a while was The SHITs,

6565
04:05:13,969 --> 04:05:15,362
they were announced as
The SHITs in the ring,

6566
04:05:15,362 --> 04:05:16,232
when they won the tournament.

6567
04:05:16,232 --> 04:05:17,653
That was when the pony was cut in half,

6568
04:05:17,653 --> 04:05:19,354
to intimidate the opposing team.

6569
04:05:19,354 --> 04:05:20,335
TRAVIS: Scanlan's idea also.

6570
04:05:20,335 --> 04:05:22,859
ORION: Tiberius and Keyleth were not happy.

6571
04:05:22,859 --> 04:05:24,175
MATT: SHITs stuck for a while until eventually

6572
04:05:24,175 --> 04:05:25,257
they got rid of the SHITs,

6573
04:05:25,257 --> 04:05:27,727
as all of a sudden they
were about to go to the

6574
04:05:27,727 --> 04:05:30,681
winter festival parade in their honor

6575
04:05:30,681 --> 04:05:32,558
for saving the entire city of Eman,

6576
04:05:32,558 --> 04:05:33,951
and the Sovereign Uriel said,

6577
04:05:33,951 --> 04:05:35,702
"what should we announce you as?"

6578
04:05:35,702 --> 04:05:37,738
and it was decided not
to announce you guys

6579
04:05:37,738 --> 04:05:39,591
in front of the city at
your parade as The SHITs.

6580
04:05:39,591 --> 04:05:41,962
ASHLEY: I was super into it.

6581
04:05:41,962 --> 04:05:44,085
Still love The SHITs.

6582
04:05:44,085 --> 04:05:45,935
MATT: Instead the name became Vox Machina.

6583
04:05:45,935 --> 04:05:47,153
So if you've heard them say that,

6584
04:05:47,153 --> 04:05:48,749
that's the official team name

6585
04:05:48,749 --> 04:05:50,278
they've created for themselves as a group.

6586
04:05:50,278 --> 04:05:52,406
ORION: With credit to Sam as well,

6587
04:05:52,406 --> 04:05:54,823
which was voted down was also

6588
04:05:56,564 --> 04:05:58,064
the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

6589
04:05:58,064 --> 04:05:58,955
Which I was a huge fan of.

6590
04:05:59,832 --> 04:06:02,196
I really wanted it to be the
Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

6591
04:06:02,196 --> 04:06:03,877
But Vox Machina sounded cooler.

6592
04:06:03,877 --> 04:06:05,608
ASHLEY: The Brotherhood of the
Sisterhood of the Order,

6593
04:06:05,608 --> 04:06:07,167
or something like that?

6594
04:06:07,167 --> 04:06:10,401
MARISHA: The Order of the Brotherhood
of the Sisterhood.

6595
04:06:10,401 --> 04:06:12,272
ORION: So Tiberius recognizes as the

6596
04:06:12,272 --> 04:06:14,990
Vox Machina/Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

6597
04:06:14,990 --> 04:06:17,501
LIAM: LargoSensei keeps asking,

6598
04:06:17,501 --> 04:06:22,128
what are your most cathartic
voice acting experiences?

6599
04:06:22,128 --> 04:06:23,942
I'm gonna guess for Ashley
that's The Last of Us,

6600
04:06:23,942 --> 04:06:26,449
since that's your fucking
heart ripped out of your chest.

6601
04:06:26,449 --> 04:06:27,866
ASHLEY: Probably, yeah.

6602
04:06:29,073 --> 04:06:32,313
LIAM: Gollum was pretty sad for me,

6603
04:06:32,313 --> 04:06:33,626
because he's a miserable bastard.

6604
04:06:33,626 --> 04:06:36,318
Also Angel from Wolverine, the X-Men.

6605
04:06:36,318 --> 04:06:38,098
ORION: Wait, does cathartic mean sad?

6606
04:06:38,098 --> 04:06:42,281
LIAM: Well it just means get
your fucking demons out.

6607
04:06:42,281 --> 04:06:43,931
Chew it up.

6608
04:06:43,931 --> 04:06:45,315
TALIESIN: Mine's really old,

6609
04:06:45,315 --> 04:06:49,086
it's probably either
Monster or Paranoia Agent.

6610
04:06:49,086 --> 04:06:51,107
I'm gonna go that far back.

6611
04:06:51,107 --> 04:06:53,152
Yeah, all the way back.

6612
04:06:53,152 --> 04:06:54,682
MATT: Fate Zero for me had a moment

6613
04:06:54,682 --> 04:06:56,879
that was pretty intense emotionally,

6614
04:06:56,879 --> 04:06:59,390
that I really enjoyed.

6615
04:06:59,390 --> 04:07:01,500
TRAVIS: Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic.

6616
04:07:01,500 --> 04:07:03,589
(all laugh)

6617
04:07:03,589 --> 04:07:04,799
MATT: Sonic Boom, yo.

6618
04:07:04,799 --> 04:07:06,382
MARISHA: Boom, Sonic Boom.

6619
04:07:08,063 --> 04:07:08,896
TRAVIS: What's that?

6620
04:07:08,896 --> 04:07:09,960
LIAM: Infamous, maybe?

6621
04:07:09,960 --> 04:07:11,171
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

6622
04:07:11,171 --> 04:07:13,431
LIAM: Pretty fucking sad.

6623
04:07:13,431 --> 04:07:14,986
TRAVIS: Brothers. Brotherhood.

6624
04:07:14,986 --> 04:07:16,042
Brotherly love.

6625
04:07:16,042 --> 04:07:19,590
ORION: I'd say for me it was doing Type-0.

6626
04:07:19,590 --> 04:07:23,807
Not so much the actual lines,
'cause I had a lot of fun.

6627
04:07:23,807 --> 04:07:26,568
I don't know if that's cathartic, but.

6628
04:07:26,568 --> 04:07:30,068
Completing an actual real life dream goal.

6629
04:07:32,177 --> 04:07:33,800
I've said this a couple times before,

6630
04:07:33,800 --> 04:07:37,381
but the last day I was
recording the last stuff,

6631
04:07:37,381 --> 04:07:39,580
I was literally crying on the way home,

6632
04:07:39,580 --> 04:07:42,738
because I finally got to level myself up.

6633
04:07:42,738 --> 04:07:45,037
And this thing kept it up,
and it was really cool.

6634
04:07:45,037 --> 04:07:46,311
TRAVIS: Matt, who were you in Fate-0?

6635
04:07:46,311 --> 04:07:48,767
MATT: I'm Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu Emiya.

6636
04:07:48,767 --> 04:07:49,600
TRAVIS: Bless you.

6637
04:07:49,600 --> 04:07:50,433
MATT: Thank you.

6638
04:07:51,449 --> 04:07:52,681
That's the dark assassin character.

6639
04:07:52,681 --> 04:07:53,957
TALIESIN: Saw a question about Percy's home,

6640
04:07:53,957 --> 04:07:55,032
and his family.

6641
04:07:55,032 --> 04:07:56,590
Percy has a really really big family,

6642
04:07:56,590 --> 04:07:58,277
that I don't mention in the video,

6643
04:07:58,277 --> 04:08:01,211
and he has not been home yet.

6644
04:08:01,211 --> 04:08:03,112
He has no interest in going home yet,

6645
04:08:03,112 --> 04:08:04,969
'cause that's terrifying.

6646
04:08:04,969 --> 04:08:06,672
So we have not dealt with that.

6647
04:08:06,672 --> 04:08:08,301
MATT: That's going to be interesting
when that comes around.

6648
04:08:08,301 --> 04:08:10,168
TRAVIS: What's under the freakin' lake?

6649
04:08:10,168 --> 04:08:11,626
LIAM: What's under the freakin' lake, Matt?

6650
04:08:11,626 --> 04:08:12,832
MARISHA: Yeah, what's under the lake?

6651
04:08:12,832 --> 04:08:14,659
MATT: You were told.

6652
04:08:14,659 --> 04:08:16,781
ORION: Yeah, it's one of those big--

6653
04:08:16,781 --> 04:08:17,614
MATT: Aboleth.

6654
04:08:17,614 --> 04:08:19,546
MARISHA: Oh yeah that's right, I did write it down.

6655
04:08:19,546 --> 04:08:22,385
MATT: Which you encountered one underground.

6656
04:08:22,385 --> 04:08:24,885
MARISHA: Yes, I was a shark.

6657
04:08:24,885 --> 04:08:27,042
MATT: Put the slime into the water.

6658
04:08:27,042 --> 04:08:29,013
You could only breathe water
and couldn't breathe air.

6659
04:08:29,013 --> 04:08:30,007
MARISHA: Remember, 'cause I was like,

6660
04:08:30,007 --> 04:08:32,746
"I'm gonna be crafty
and turn into a shark,"

6661
04:08:32,746 --> 04:08:35,508
and then I started immediately drowning.

6662
04:08:35,508 --> 04:08:39,215
ORION: How do you keep players
from getting OP, Matt?

6663
04:08:39,215 --> 04:08:41,751
MATT: Make the monsters more powerful.

6664
04:08:41,751 --> 04:08:43,710
ORION: Behind the scenes,

6665
04:08:43,710 --> 04:08:46,140
I'm always constantly up his ass,

6666
04:08:46,140 --> 04:08:48,162
trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible,

6667
04:08:48,162 --> 04:08:50,020
and he's always stopping me a lot.

6668
04:08:50,020 --> 04:08:51,937
MATT: Balance is important.

6669
04:08:53,125 --> 04:08:54,288
I mean, the characters,

6670
04:08:54,288 --> 04:08:55,770
everyone here has really good characters

6671
04:08:55,770 --> 04:08:56,965
that have a lot of cool abilities,

6672
04:08:56,965 --> 04:08:59,376
but they also have a lot of challenges

6673
04:08:59,376 --> 04:09:00,635
that come at them that make them,

6674
04:09:00,635 --> 04:09:03,011
not only use those abilities, but also,

6675
04:09:03,011 --> 04:09:04,810
monsters can have cool abilities too.

6676
04:09:04,810 --> 04:09:07,633
LIAM: Bracheon89, you said
Stephen King plays D&amp;D?

6677
04:09:07,633 --> 04:09:08,866
ASHLEY: Yes, that's what I was trying to say.

6678
04:09:08,866 --> 04:09:10,011
What?

6679
04:09:10,011 --> 04:09:11,534
LIAM: Bracheon, we're going
to wait for your answer.

6680
04:09:11,534 --> 04:09:12,869
How do you know he plays D&amp;D?

6681
04:09:12,869 --> 04:09:13,702
ASHLEY: Are you sure?

6682
04:09:13,702 --> 04:09:14,535
LIAM: Let's get him in here.

6683
04:09:14,535 --> 04:09:15,702
MATT: I'd love that.

6684
04:09:16,571 --> 04:09:19,899
TALIESIN: The group's worst decision
in D&amp;D was the dragon,

6685
04:09:19,899 --> 04:09:21,374
I think.

6686
04:09:21,374 --> 04:09:22,527
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Grog?

6687
04:09:22,527 --> 04:09:23,360
TALIESIN: Grog.

6688
04:09:23,360 --> 04:09:25,102
TRAVIS: Listen, there was a shitload of gold.

6689
04:09:25,102 --> 04:09:27,427
ASHLEY: I still don't think that was a bad idea.

6690
04:09:27,427 --> 04:09:28,801
ORION: Oh, when he started hoarding all the gold?

6691
04:09:28,801 --> 04:09:29,912
MARISHA: We still don't know if that--

6692
04:09:29,912 --> 04:09:30,745
LIAM: Takes a lot of stupid.

6693
04:09:30,745 --> 04:09:32,129
MARISHA: He might have been an ally.

6694
04:09:32,129 --> 04:09:34,774
We might have killed
someone who was valuable.

6695
04:09:34,774 --> 04:09:37,365
TALIESIN: You were still freaking
out like a month later,

6696
04:09:37,365 --> 04:09:38,746
you were feeling really bad.

6697
04:09:38,746 --> 04:09:40,342
TRAVIS: Well, I did almost get us killed.

6698
04:09:40,342 --> 04:09:41,175
ASHLEY: I feel like it was a good decision.

6699
04:09:41,175 --> 04:09:42,008
MATT: To be fair,

6700
04:09:42,008 --> 04:09:43,505
it's the only time I've ever had a player

6701
04:09:43,505 --> 04:09:44,962
rage loot before.

6702
04:09:44,962 --> 04:09:46,304
(all laugh)

6703
04:09:46,304 --> 04:09:49,278
MATT: You went into a rage, and
used it to just loot more.

6704
04:09:49,278 --> 04:09:51,093
And then the dragon revealed itself,

6705
04:09:51,093 --> 04:09:52,218
and you looked at it,

6706
04:09:52,218 --> 04:09:53,353
and you just kept looting.

6707
04:09:53,353 --> 04:09:56,044
(all laugh)

6708
04:09:56,044 --> 04:09:57,929
TRAVIS: You guys take care of this.

6709
04:09:57,929 --> 04:09:59,141
ASHLEY: That was hilarious.
MATT: That's Grog.

6710
04:09:59,141 --> 04:10:00,416
LIAM: Somebody keeps asking,

6711
04:10:00,416 --> 04:10:01,996
and we'll do a show of hands here,

6712
04:10:01,996 --> 04:10:04,338
Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?

6713
04:10:04,338 --> 04:10:05,630
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.

6714
04:10:05,630 --> 04:10:06,686
MARISHA: Ooh, that's tough.

6715
04:10:06,686 --> 04:10:07,519
LIAM: What do you prefer?

6716
04:10:07,519 --> 04:10:09,378
10 seconds to think
about it, and then I'll--

6717
04:10:09,378 --> 04:10:10,634
TALIESIN: That's like Star Trek or Star Wars.

6718
04:10:10,634 --> 04:10:12,378
MARISHA: Yeah, hard.

6719
04:10:12,378 --> 04:10:13,446
LIAM: They're asking the question.

6720
04:10:13,446 --> 04:10:15,301
ZAC: Don't be afraid, come on.

6721
04:10:15,301 --> 04:10:16,134
TRAVIS: That's tough.

6722
04:10:16,134 --> 04:10:19,163
LIAM: Lord of the Rings,
fuckin' Lord of the Rings.

6723
04:10:19,163 --> 04:10:21,659
There you go, there's the answer.

6724
04:10:21,659 --> 04:10:23,782
ASHLEY: I don't know, man.

6725
04:10:23,782 --> 04:10:25,399
TALIESIN: Lord of the Rings, but
I see Game of Thrones on the side.

6726
04:10:25,399 --> 04:10:26,629
LIAM: I love Game of Thrones.

6727
04:10:26,629 --> 04:10:27,475
MARISHA: Of course we do.

6728
04:10:27,475 --> 04:10:28,964
TRAVIS: Lord of the Rings.

6729
04:10:28,964 --> 04:10:30,159
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have Game of Thrones

6730
04:10:30,159 --> 04:10:31,225
without Lord of the Rings.

6731
04:10:31,225 --> 04:10:32,058
MARISHA: That's the thing.

6732
04:10:32,058 --> 04:10:34,254
LIAM: Maybe possibly not Dungeons &amp; Dragons

6733
04:10:34,254 --> 04:10:35,495
without Lord of the Rings.

6734
04:10:35,495 --> 04:10:38,297
ASHLEY: This is true, it's the OG.

6735
04:10:38,297 --> 04:10:39,741
I don't know what that even--

6736
04:10:39,741 --> 04:10:40,902
TALIESIN: You said that.

6737
04:10:40,902 --> 04:10:42,122
That just came out of your mouth.

6738
04:10:42,122 --> 04:10:44,435
ASHLEY: Please let's leave it alone.

6739
04:10:44,435 --> 04:10:45,482
Moving on.

6740
04:10:45,482 --> 04:10:46,315
TRAVIS: That's the OG.

6741
04:10:46,315 --> 04:10:48,556
ASHLEY: What is this, what do we have over here?

6742
04:10:48,556 --> 04:10:50,596
Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved

6743
04:10:50,596 --> 04:10:51,858
in his intro video?

6744
04:10:51,858 --> 04:10:52,691
LIAM: Pike's daddy.

6745
04:10:52,691 --> 04:10:54,637
ASHLEY: No, that was my great great grandfather.

6746
04:10:54,637 --> 04:10:55,917
TRAVIS: That's right.

6747
04:10:55,917 --> 04:10:58,001
ASHLEY: Yes, great great grandfather Wilhand.

6748
04:10:58,001 --> 04:11:00,267
TRAVIS: Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand.

6749
04:11:00,267 --> 04:11:01,100
ASHLEY: That's right.

6750
04:11:01,100 --> 04:11:03,551
LIAM: Wilhand the money.

6751
04:11:06,091 --> 04:11:08,491
TRAVIS: Grog has an intelligence of six,
he's gonna get names wrong from time to time.

6752
04:11:08,491 --> 04:11:12,328
LIAM: Everybody, if you could
choose whatever fantasy world

6753
04:11:12,328 --> 04:11:14,583
to live in, what would it be?

6754
04:11:14,583 --> 04:11:15,810
TRAVIS: Marvel.

6755
04:11:15,810 --> 04:11:16,794
TALIESIN: Ooh.

6756
04:11:16,794 --> 04:11:18,794
ORION: I would live in the...

6757
04:11:19,982 --> 04:11:23,129
Next Generation world, universe.

6758
04:11:23,129 --> 04:11:24,414
TALIESIN: You had me at Marvel.

6759
04:11:24,414 --> 04:11:25,495
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6760
04:11:25,495 --> 04:11:26,580
ZAC: Here's the thing,

6761
04:11:26,580 --> 04:11:28,761
you could live in Marvel what you live in,

6762
04:11:28,761 --> 04:11:31,439
if you couldn't live in
that world as a superhero,

6763
04:11:31,439 --> 04:11:32,832
just as a normal person.

6764
04:11:32,832 --> 04:11:34,803
TRAVIS: Right, not in New York.

6765
04:11:34,803 --> 04:11:36,017
Anybody that lives in New York

6766
04:11:36,017 --> 04:11:37,458
in the Marvel universe is just stupid.

6767
04:11:37,458 --> 04:11:38,822
Like rent's gotta be $1.50.

6768
04:11:38,822 --> 04:11:39,727
TALIESIN: Terrible idea.

6769
04:11:39,727 --> 04:11:41,792
MATT: I'd say Myst.

6770
04:11:41,792 --> 04:11:44,364
So I can just write my own worlds

6771
04:11:44,364 --> 04:11:46,290
to infinity from there.

6772
04:11:46,290 --> 04:11:47,255
LIAM: Lord of the Rings.

6773
04:11:47,255 --> 04:11:48,258
MATT: Or Amber as well.

6774
04:11:48,258 --> 04:11:49,957
ASHLEY: I was gonna say Lord of the Rings.

6775
04:11:49,957 --> 04:11:52,034
Maybe Rivendell.

6776
04:11:52,034 --> 04:11:53,895
MARISHA: I'm gonna say Final Fantasy 10.

6777
04:11:53,895 --> 04:11:54,770
MATT: Grey Havens.

6778
04:11:54,770 --> 04:11:56,431
If you're gonna do Lord of the Rings, do
Grey Havens,

6779
04:11:56,431 --> 04:11:57,735
'cause you're far enough away from Mordor,

6780
04:11:57,735 --> 04:12:00,279
where it's generally
not gonna be a problem.

6781
04:12:00,279 --> 04:12:03,098
LIAM: I wanna be one of the Fellowship.

6782
04:12:03,098 --> 04:12:05,868
Ashley Johnson lived in a
Marvel universe already, right?

6783
04:12:05,868 --> 04:12:06,780
MATT: That's true.

6784
04:12:06,780 --> 04:12:09,096
ORION: See, and it's a big hassle.

6785
04:12:09,096 --> 04:12:10,319
MARISHA: It was a big hassle.

6786
04:12:10,319 --> 04:12:11,526
ORION: Yeah.

6787
04:12:11,526 --> 04:12:13,588
MATT: Before the stream, our D&amp;D session--

6788
04:12:13,588 --> 04:12:15,778
MARISHA: High insurance rates.

6789
04:12:15,778 --> 04:12:16,859
MATT: Before the stream our D&amp;D sessions

6790
04:12:16,859 --> 04:12:19,412
would happen once every
month to month and a half,

6791
04:12:19,412 --> 04:12:20,486
more like month and a half.

6792
04:12:20,486 --> 04:12:21,962
LIAM: Why is Matt Scarlet Witch?

6793
04:12:21,962 --> 04:12:23,545
MATT: I'm down with it.

6794
04:12:24,578 --> 04:12:26,421
'Cause I alter reality.

6795
04:12:26,421 --> 04:12:28,471
Power makes sense.

6796
04:12:28,471 --> 04:12:29,887
Our sessions used to be once every month,

6797
04:12:29,887 --> 04:12:30,745
or month and a half,

6798
04:12:30,745 --> 04:12:34,073
and they would be about
six to eight hours.

6799
04:12:34,073 --> 04:12:35,658
But the problem is we'd
play so infrequently,

6800
04:12:35,658 --> 04:12:38,196
every session I'd have to
remind everyone what happened,

6801
04:12:38,196 --> 04:12:40,037
and it was hard to schedule.

6802
04:12:40,037 --> 04:12:41,291
Part of the reason we're
even doing this show,

6803
04:12:41,291 --> 04:12:42,752
is because it's technically work,

6804
04:12:42,752 --> 04:12:45,097
which allows those of us who have families

6805
04:12:45,097 --> 04:12:48,496
and children more of an
excuse to come more often.

6806
04:12:48,496 --> 04:12:49,329
So yeah.

6807
04:12:51,126 --> 04:12:53,876
LIAM: Googoo17, Arkazey keeps asking,

6808
04:12:55,615 --> 04:12:57,420
what's your favorite
nerdy t-shirt you own?

6809
04:12:57,420 --> 04:12:59,873
Mine is one that says Mordor World Tour,

6810
04:12:59,873 --> 04:13:01,574
it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt,

6811
04:13:01,574 --> 04:13:03,569
but it says Mordor World Tour.

6812
04:13:03,569 --> 04:13:05,031
MARISHA: That's cool.

6813
04:13:05,031 --> 04:13:07,005
Favorite nerdy t-shirt.

6814
04:13:07,005 --> 04:13:10,290
TALIESIN: I've got a Sons of Anarchy
Doctor Who t-shirt,

6815
04:13:10,290 --> 04:13:12,598
I'm a really big fan of.

6816
04:13:12,598 --> 04:13:14,664
I'll wear it next week.

6817
04:13:14,664 --> 04:13:18,544
MARISHA: I've got like an army, kind of soldiery,

6818
04:13:18,544 --> 04:13:23,272
looking t-shirt that says
Chimera, like Chimera Corps.

6819
04:13:23,272 --> 04:13:24,248
MATT: That's actually the one I was gonna say,

6820
04:13:24,248 --> 04:13:26,287
that's my favorite shirt too.

6821
04:13:26,287 --> 04:13:28,096
MARISHA: I like your displacer kitty you've got.

6822
04:13:28,096 --> 04:13:29,391
MATT: Displacer kitty's kind of cool.

6823
04:13:29,391 --> 04:13:30,406
Adorable.

6824
04:13:30,406 --> 04:13:32,509
TALIESIN: I like your shine on me shirt.

6825
04:13:32,509 --> 04:13:33,342
MATT: Oh God.

6826
04:13:33,342 --> 04:13:34,862
If you guys haven't watched.

6827
04:13:35,789 --> 04:13:37,609
Chris Dane Owens, on YouTube,

6828
04:13:37,609 --> 04:13:39,114
Chris Dane Owens, Shine on Me.

6829
04:13:39,114 --> 04:13:40,918
It's a music video, watch it.

6830
04:13:40,918 --> 04:13:44,457
Chris Dane Owens, Shine, or
Shine on Me, YouTube, do it.

6831
04:13:44,457 --> 04:13:45,512
TALIESIN: I love that you own the shirt from it.

6832
04:13:45,512 --> 04:13:47,385
MATT: I bought a shirt from it,
'cause it's that amazing,

6833
04:13:47,385 --> 04:13:48,329
I had to.

6834
04:13:48,329 --> 04:13:49,973
TRAVIS: Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan

6835
04:13:49,973 --> 04:13:52,272
killed the naga for her?

6836
04:13:52,272 --> 04:13:53,526
MATT: I don't think someone's done it yet.

6837
04:13:53,526 --> 04:13:56,045
LIAM: Scanlan had his first kill.

6838
04:13:56,045 --> 04:13:57,033
You saw it, right?

6839
04:13:57,033 --> 04:13:58,949
MATT: You saw it on the stream.

6840
04:13:58,949 --> 04:14:00,585
ASHLEY: I saw it, me, Ashley saw it,

6841
04:14:00,585 --> 04:14:03,189
but Pike did not hear about it yet.

6842
04:14:03,189 --> 04:14:05,006
Who knows, that could be the thing

6843
04:14:05,006 --> 04:14:06,985
that seals the deal.

6844
04:14:06,985 --> 04:14:08,410
I'll be like, you killed the naga?

6845
04:14:08,410 --> 04:14:09,818
Okay, let's do this.

6846
04:14:09,818 --> 04:14:12,068
(all laugh)

6847
04:14:14,792 --> 04:14:17,441
MARISHA: Any betrayals in the game?

6848
04:14:17,441 --> 04:14:22,040
MATT: No betrayals, disagreements,
and occasional--

6849
04:14:22,040 --> 04:14:23,049
TRAVIS: Trippings and beat-downs.

6850
04:14:23,049 --> 04:14:25,211
MATT: And stealing of flying carpets.

6851
04:14:25,211 --> 04:14:27,044
ASHLEY: I actually did step,

6852
04:14:27,886 --> 04:14:31,077
I kind of did hurt Liam one game.

6853
04:14:31,077 --> 04:14:31,910
Or Vax.

6854
04:14:33,773 --> 04:14:35,213
LIAM: The game we played together?

6855
04:14:35,213 --> 04:14:37,414
We did just the two of us one night.

6856
04:14:37,414 --> 04:14:41,581
ASHLEY: There were some of the
girls changing in a room.

6857
04:14:43,120 --> 04:14:44,091
MATT: I forgot about this.

6858
04:14:44,091 --> 04:14:47,119
LIAM: I was very curious to see you naked.

6859
04:14:47,119 --> 04:14:49,016
But that's kinda fallen on the wayside.

6860
04:14:49,016 --> 04:14:50,317
ASHLEY: Vax was very curious to see

6861
04:14:50,317 --> 04:14:52,607
what a gnome looked like naked.

6862
04:14:52,607 --> 04:14:53,942
LIAM: Never seen it before.

6863
04:14:53,942 --> 04:14:55,143
MARISHA: So you did a little peeping tom?

6864
04:14:55,143 --> 04:14:56,799
LIAM: Why wouldn't I wanna expand my horizons?

6865
04:14:56,799 --> 04:14:57,953
MATT: So he rolled stealth.

6866
04:14:57,953 --> 04:15:00,968
ASHLEY: So he rolled stealth, and
he did, and saw or whatever,

6867
04:15:00,968 --> 04:15:03,286
and then when I came back
out, and I found out about it.

6868
04:15:03,286 --> 04:15:04,838
LIAM: Looked good, it was compact.

6869
04:15:06,285 --> 04:15:08,163
ASHLEY: It was just a small human.

6870
04:15:08,163 --> 04:15:10,013
And I think I stepped on your foot,

6871
04:15:10,013 --> 04:15:11,481
and gave you some damage.

6872
04:15:11,481 --> 04:15:12,314
LIAM: Maybe a hit point.

6873
04:15:12,314 --> 04:15:13,514
ASHLEY: Yeah, a hit point or two.

6874
04:15:13,514 --> 04:15:14,548
MATT: You earned it.

6875
04:15:14,548 --> 04:15:15,423
ASHLEY: I earned it.

6876
04:15:15,423 --> 04:15:17,335
ORION: Somebody, seagullblaster--

6877
04:15:17,335 --> 04:15:19,992
LIAM: No, Vax didn't spy on
Vex, sorry, go ahead.

6878
04:15:19,992 --> 04:15:23,647
ORION: Asked-- Tiberius said something
about the Palestone,

6879
04:15:23,647 --> 04:15:26,555
and what it is, and this is,

6880
04:15:26,555 --> 04:15:27,784
somebody asked a different question,

6881
04:15:27,784 --> 04:15:30,413
this is kinda gonna answer both.

6882
04:15:30,413 --> 04:15:31,739
I, and everybody else,

6883
04:15:31,739 --> 04:15:34,575
wrote backstories for Matthew

6884
04:15:34,575 --> 04:15:39,317
to essentially give him so he
could construct our universe.

6885
04:15:39,317 --> 04:15:41,854
Tiberius' particular quest

6886
04:15:41,854 --> 04:15:45,282
is looking for particular artifacts.

6887
04:15:45,282 --> 04:15:47,737
Essentially I made him like Mulder.

6888
04:15:47,737 --> 04:15:50,145
Nobody believes in the city
that these things exist,

6889
04:15:50,145 --> 04:15:53,139
except him, so the truth
is out there kinda thing.

6890
04:15:53,139 --> 04:15:56,323
So I made up these five
different artifacts

6891
04:15:56,323 --> 04:15:57,383
that do different things.

6892
04:15:57,383 --> 04:15:58,645
And I don't know what they do until

6893
04:15:58,645 --> 04:16:00,992
I might maybe find them, and if I do,

6894
04:16:00,992 --> 04:16:04,789
it's up to him, to Matt,
to determine what they are,

6895
04:16:04,789 --> 04:16:06,437
if they are anything.

6896
04:16:06,437 --> 04:16:07,715
They might be nothing, I don't know.

6897
04:16:07,715 --> 04:16:10,186
I've found one item so
far, and it's awesome,

6898
04:16:10,186 --> 04:16:13,155
and all of us have given him bits and pieces,

6899
04:16:13,155 --> 04:16:15,283
and that's how he constructs our story

6900
04:16:15,283 --> 04:16:17,577
with things that you throw in yourself.

6901
04:16:17,577 --> 04:16:19,437
MATT: Yeah, and each player,

6902
04:16:19,437 --> 04:16:22,381
all their story lines work into the world.

6903
04:16:22,381 --> 04:16:24,692
Not all of them will happen
immediately of course,

6904
04:16:24,692 --> 04:16:27,143
some people have had personal encounters

6905
04:16:27,143 --> 04:16:30,483
and story encounters already,
some are yet to occur,

6906
04:16:30,483 --> 04:16:32,298
and there will be points
throughout the campaign

6907
04:16:32,298 --> 04:16:34,943
where the party will probably have to move

6908
04:16:34,943 --> 04:16:37,846
and individually deal
with each person's story

6909
04:16:37,846 --> 04:16:39,343
to some extent.

6910
04:16:39,343 --> 04:16:42,033
MARISHA: Dealt a little bit with each person.

6911
04:16:42,033 --> 04:16:44,255
MATT: Touched a little bit like--

6912
04:16:44,255 --> 04:16:46,715
In Eman, we've seen Vex and Vax's father.

6913
04:16:46,715 --> 04:16:49,062
LIAM: Vex and I ran into to our father again

6914
04:16:49,062 --> 04:16:50,498
for the first time in many years,

6915
04:16:50,498 --> 04:16:51,874
it was a little frosty.

6916
04:16:51,874 --> 04:16:53,087
MATT: Had a new family.

6917
04:16:53,087 --> 04:16:55,297
LIAM: Have a little half sister.

6918
04:16:55,297 --> 04:16:56,511
TRAVIS: Matt, you have a favorite voice?

6919
04:16:56,511 --> 04:17:00,767
And does it hurt to do
the gnarly monster voice?

6920
04:17:00,767 --> 04:17:02,129
MATT: If you do it for an
extended period of time

6921
04:17:02,129 --> 04:17:03,560
it can be kind of shitty.

6922
04:17:03,560 --> 04:17:05,634
ASHLEY: I don't know how you do this new one.

6923
04:17:05,634 --> 04:17:06,595
TRAVIS: Breathing in and out.

6924
04:17:06,595 --> 04:17:07,895
LIAM: That's inward singing, man.

6925
04:17:07,895 --> 04:17:09,494
TRAVIS: It is inward singing.

6926
04:17:09,494 --> 04:17:11,043
LIAM: And then I'm fucking singing,

6927
04:17:11,043 --> 04:17:14,126
and then--

6928
04:17:19,205 --> 04:17:20,038
MATT: Actually, it's funny,

6929
04:17:20,038 --> 04:17:22,831
a bunch of my NPCs that
I've done since high school

6930
04:17:22,831 --> 04:17:25,962
have ended up turning into
characters I've booked.

6931
04:17:25,962 --> 04:17:27,479
I'll go into an audition and be like,

6932
04:17:27,479 --> 04:17:29,404
"I'll go ahead and do Nutibe Curios,

6933
04:17:29,404 --> 04:17:31,369
"from my Second campaign,"

6934
04:17:31,369 --> 04:17:32,758
and I'll end up doing that character.

6935
04:17:32,758 --> 04:17:36,008
Alof in Pillars is a character I NPCed

6936
04:17:37,855 --> 04:17:38,939
back in high school.

6937
04:17:38,939 --> 04:17:39,772
LIAM: That's awesome.

6938
04:17:39,772 --> 04:17:41,348
TALIESIN: They still haven't heard my favorite voice

6939
04:17:41,348 --> 04:17:42,808
from this campaign yet.

6940
04:17:42,808 --> 04:17:44,739
'Cause we haven't gone
back to the city yet.

6941
04:17:44,951 --> 04:17:47,951
MATT: Oh, Gilmore?

6942
04:17:47,951 --> 04:17:50,790
LIAM: Gilmore is a wonderful
magician who owns a shop.

6943
04:17:51,806 --> 04:17:52,689
ORION: Was that the fancy--

6944
04:17:52,689 --> 04:17:53,699
LIAM: Yes, in the city of Eman,

6945
04:17:53,699 --> 04:17:57,104
he's got a big friggin'
crush on me, and wants me.

6946
04:17:57,104 --> 04:18:00,447
Wants me and some day you
and I will actualize that.

6947
04:18:00,447 --> 04:18:01,355
MATT: We'll have to roleplay that.

6948
04:18:02,738 --> 04:18:03,642
LIAM: Maybe in a game. Maybe not.

6949
04:18:03,642 --> 04:18:07,425
TRAVIS: What do we think is
taking over the hive mind?

6950
04:18:07,425 --> 04:18:09,081
MATT: What do you guys think is
taking over the hive mind?

6951
04:18:09,081 --> 04:18:10,794
MARISHA: Well we know it's named--

6952
04:18:10,794 --> 04:18:11,777
ORION: Obviously some butthole.

6953
04:18:13,539 --> 04:18:15,483
ASHLEY: I think I might have an idea.

6954
04:18:15,483 --> 04:18:16,536
TRAVIS: Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even

6955
04:18:16,536 --> 04:18:18,191
know about yet, right?

6956
04:18:18,191 --> 04:18:19,337
ASHLEY: Well.

6957
04:18:19,337 --> 04:18:23,138
TRAVIS: Taking those mushrooms,
having those visions.

6958
04:18:23,138 --> 04:18:24,795
ASHLEY: Taking those mushrooms.

6959
04:18:24,795 --> 04:18:28,011
LIAM: Someone asked how do game devs find us

6960
04:18:28,011 --> 04:18:29,344
for acting work?

6961
04:18:30,282 --> 04:18:33,194
We all audition, hundreds
of people audition,

6962
04:18:33,194 --> 04:18:37,018
for every role in Los
Angeles, we all just try.

6963
04:18:37,018 --> 04:18:40,734
Today I worked on a superhero game,

6964
04:18:40,734 --> 04:18:43,671
and the guy who was directing
me for voiceover said,

6965
04:18:43,671 --> 04:18:45,048
"hey, so what are you doing
for the rest of the day?"

6966
04:18:45,048 --> 04:18:46,689
And I said, well, I'm gonna go to the gym,

6967
04:18:46,689 --> 04:18:48,378
I'm gonna do this, then
I'm gonna go do that,

6968
04:18:48,378 --> 04:18:49,478
do you know about that D&amp;D show

6969
04:18:49,478 --> 04:18:50,686
that a couple of us are doing?

6970
04:18:50,686 --> 04:18:52,111
And he's like, "yeah, I heard about that."

6971
04:18:52,111 --> 04:18:54,654
And the guy who had written the game went,

6972
04:18:54,654 --> 04:18:56,924
"yeah, I've watched every episode."

6973
04:18:56,924 --> 04:18:58,538
(all laugh)

6974
04:18:58,538 --> 04:19:00,104
MATT: So awesome.

6975
04:19:00,104 --> 04:19:01,521
TALIESIN: That's so cool.

6976
04:19:03,947 --> 04:19:05,912
ASHLEY: Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.

6977
04:19:05,912 --> 04:19:07,262
TALIESIN: I think we should save that for,

6978
04:19:07,262 --> 04:19:09,254
wait until they actually meet Gilmore.

6979
04:19:09,254 --> 04:19:11,071
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can't give it away.

6980
04:19:11,071 --> 04:19:12,272
MATT: Gilmore's a fun one.

6981
04:19:12,272 --> 04:19:13,701
ASHLEY: Gilmore's awesome.

6982
04:19:13,701 --> 04:19:15,845
MATT: Gilmore is very Broadway.

6983
04:19:16,803 --> 04:19:18,437
He's very--

6984
04:19:18,437 --> 04:19:19,475
TALIESIN: Not the gargoyle.

6985
04:19:19,475 --> 04:19:20,376
MATT: No, no.

6986
04:19:20,376 --> 04:19:23,128
I could see him being a
character in a John Waters film.

6987
04:19:23,128 --> 04:19:25,073
TALIESIN: Oh my God, yeah.

6988
04:19:25,073 --> 04:19:26,116
ASHLEY: Totally.

6989
04:19:26,116 --> 04:19:27,378
LIAM: Give him a pencil-thin mustache.

6990
04:19:27,378 --> 04:19:28,315
MATT: Yeah.

6991
04:19:32,148 --> 04:19:33,862
TALIESIN: I'm trying to catch up.

6992
04:19:33,862 --> 04:19:35,830
TRAVIS: Greater overall motivations?

6993
04:19:36,757 --> 04:19:37,613
MATT: That may or may not be secret,

6994
04:19:37,613 --> 04:19:39,095
depending on the characters.

6995
04:19:39,095 --> 04:19:43,677
MARISHA: What is each person's
favorite D&amp;D monster?

6996
04:19:43,677 --> 04:19:44,652
TRAVIS: A dead one.

6997
04:19:45,839 --> 04:19:49,172
LIAM: I liked it when Grog got it on with a,

6998
04:19:50,203 --> 04:19:51,458
what was it, a nymph?

6999
04:19:51,458 --> 04:19:52,291
TRAVIS: What?

7000
04:19:52,291 --> 04:19:53,193
MATT: Yeah!

7001
04:19:53,193 --> 04:19:55,127
TRAVIS: You don't know man, I
went through the portal,

7002
04:19:55,127 --> 04:19:57,109
handled my business like a champ.

7003
04:19:57,109 --> 04:19:58,877
LIAM: In the air.

7004
04:19:58,877 --> 04:20:00,309
TRAVIS: I don't kiss and tell.

7005
04:20:00,309 --> 04:20:01,142
Nobody knows.

7006
04:20:01,142 --> 04:20:02,709
I got what we were supposed to get.

7007
04:20:02,709 --> 04:20:04,248
LIAM: A nymph could have attacked us,

7008
04:20:04,248 --> 04:20:05,713
but Grog looked her in the eye,

7009
04:20:05,713 --> 04:20:07,312
and she liked what she saw.

7010
04:20:07,312 --> 04:20:08,883
Then he disappeared for a little while,

7011
04:20:08,883 --> 04:20:11,333
and he came back and he
was in a really good mood.

7012
04:20:11,333 --> 04:20:12,553
TRAVIS: I flashed her the look, man.

7013
04:20:12,553 --> 04:20:13,714
She was mine, what can I say?

7014
04:20:14,647 --> 04:20:17,329
TALIESIN: I like the little green gelatinous cubes.

7015
04:20:17,329 --> 04:20:19,074
I think they're fun, and
then if you make 'em right,

7016
04:20:19,074 --> 04:20:20,082
you can just make 'em out of jello,

7017
04:20:20,082 --> 04:20:23,014
and eat them when you're
done, that's awesome.

7018
04:20:23,014 --> 04:20:25,002
MATT: I don't wanna answer that
question necessarily,

7019
04:20:25,002 --> 04:20:27,032
because I might be using
them in the campaign

7020
04:20:27,032 --> 04:20:27,865
at some point.

7021
04:20:27,865 --> 04:20:28,698
ORION: Which one?

7022
04:20:28,698 --> 04:20:29,626
MATT: Nothing.

7023
04:20:29,626 --> 04:20:31,390
ASHLEY: So that means we haven't used 'em yet.

7024
04:20:31,390 --> 04:20:34,229
MATT: But overall, I just love the tarrasque

7025
04:20:34,229 --> 04:20:35,938
because it's like the game ender.

7026
04:20:35,938 --> 04:20:37,115
It's the godzilla.

7027
04:20:37,115 --> 04:20:38,836
It's the one DM's move where he's like,

7028
04:20:38,836 --> 04:20:40,236
"I'm done with this campaign, hey guys,

7029
04:20:40,236 --> 04:20:41,783
"you're gonna fight a tarrasque,
either you're all gonna die,

7030
04:20:41,783 --> 04:20:43,732
"or you beat it, and you beat the game!"

7031
04:20:43,732 --> 04:20:45,392
So the tarrassque is always fun.

7032
04:20:45,392 --> 04:20:47,588
ORION: Is it the final boss?

7033
04:20:47,588 --> 04:20:50,999
LIAM: I've always been fascinated with the mind flayers.

7034
04:20:50,999 --> 04:20:54,832
You're fucking throwing
an army of them at us.

7035
04:20:56,669 --> 04:20:57,762
'Cause they're dangerous.

7036
04:20:57,762 --> 04:20:59,155
MATT: Yeah, they're terrible.

7037
04:20:59,155 --> 04:21:01,803
LIAM: And they're so outside of the norm.

7038
04:21:01,803 --> 04:21:03,788
MATT: And hey you stealthed up,

7039
04:21:03,788 --> 04:21:05,722
and pretty much killed
one in one round today.

7040
04:21:05,722 --> 04:21:06,974
ORION: That was insane.

7041
04:21:06,974 --> 04:21:09,579
When the mud on the face,

7042
04:21:09,579 --> 04:21:11,512
and the stab in the
fucking back of the head.

7043
04:21:11,512 --> 04:21:15,095
MATT: You guys black ops'ed that entire barracks.

7044
04:21:16,533 --> 04:21:18,679
LIAM: I'm proud of the knife.

7045
04:21:18,679 --> 04:21:21,567
TALIESIN: I know what you're talking about.

7046
04:21:21,567 --> 04:21:23,433
TRAVIS: Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children,

7047
04:21:23,433 --> 04:21:24,893
that we know of.

7048
04:21:27,019 --> 04:21:28,787
Or that you can prove.

7049
04:21:28,787 --> 04:21:30,124
LIAM: Other streamed D&amp;D games,

7050
04:21:30,124 --> 04:21:33,551
like Rollplay hosted by itmejp?

7051
04:21:33,551 --> 04:21:34,384
TRAVIS: No.

7052
04:21:34,384 --> 04:21:35,399
LIAM: No.

7053
04:21:35,399 --> 04:21:36,564
Maybe we will, though.

7054
04:21:36,564 --> 04:21:37,397
ORION: I won't.

7055
04:21:37,397 --> 04:21:40,300
LIAM: Everyone play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

7056
04:21:40,300 --> 04:21:43,050
ASHLEY: My favorite NPC character is

7057
04:21:46,174 --> 04:21:47,994
a little butler who I think became--

7058
04:21:48,963 --> 04:21:50,125
TRAVIS: Yes!

7059
04:21:50,125 --> 04:21:52,778
ASHLEY: He's the cutest little
thing you will ever see,

7060
04:21:52,778 --> 04:21:55,385
and I think now he works at--

7061
04:21:55,385 --> 04:21:56,360
TALIESIN: He works for us now.

7062
04:21:56,360 --> 04:21:57,344
MATT: Yep, you guys hired him,

7063
04:21:57,344 --> 04:21:59,974
and he's currently helping
keep your Keep in good shape.

7064
04:21:59,974 --> 04:22:00,898
ASHLEY: What's his name?

7065
04:22:00,898 --> 04:22:01,731
ORION: The old fellow, right?

7066
04:22:01,731 --> 04:22:04,611
MATT: I'm trying to remember, I'll have to
go look at the list again.

7067
04:22:04,611 --> 04:22:05,729
I have so many NPCs, I have a hard time.

7068
04:22:05,729 --> 04:22:06,819
ASHLEY: He's just the sweetest little thing

7069
04:22:06,819 --> 04:22:08,236
you ever did see.

7070
04:22:11,030 --> 04:22:12,375
MATT: Grog's flatlined intelligence,

7071
04:22:12,375 --> 04:22:13,817
anything like that happen before?

7072
04:22:13,817 --> 04:22:16,744
That was the first of
that type of situation.

7073
04:22:16,744 --> 04:22:18,611
TRAVIS: I went unconscious once 'cause I fell,

7074
04:22:18,611 --> 04:22:19,506
how far did I fall?

7075
04:22:19,506 --> 04:22:20,419
TALIESIN: Wow, you fell.

7076
04:22:20,419 --> 04:22:21,436
ORION: Oh, that was a crazy one too.

7077
04:22:21,436 --> 04:22:23,373
MATT: They were there fighting
in an underground cavern,

7078
04:22:23,373 --> 04:22:25,223
and at the very, very top of this giant,

7079
04:22:25,223 --> 04:22:27,467
like 170-foot ceiling,

7080
04:22:27,467 --> 04:22:29,463
which they had all kinda floated up to,

7081
04:22:29,463 --> 04:22:31,789
and put a rope, anchor in.

7082
04:22:31,789 --> 04:22:33,183
TRAVIS: I was ready to Toro the bull.

7083
04:22:33,183 --> 04:22:35,346
MATT: The first umber hulk you guys ever encountered,

7084
04:22:35,346 --> 04:22:37,252
ended up pushing Grog out of the hole,

7085
04:22:37,252 --> 04:22:38,715
bullrushing him.

7086
04:22:38,715 --> 04:22:40,642
Had the rope tied around his waist,

7087
04:22:40,642 --> 04:22:42,359
but unfortunately Grog
weighs about 600 pounds,

7088
04:22:42,359 --> 04:22:43,192
rope snapped,

7089
04:22:43,192 --> 04:22:44,736
and he took enough damage
to go from full health

7090
04:22:44,736 --> 04:22:47,573
to unconscious and
bleeding out in one round.

7091
04:22:47,573 --> 04:22:49,517
MARISHA: 'Cause he confused you, right?

7092
04:22:49,517 --> 04:22:51,768
And you just hari-karied off the hole?

7093
04:22:51,768 --> 04:22:53,596
TRAVIS: I was gonna dodge and be all awesome,

7094
04:22:53,596 --> 04:22:57,323
and say ole or some
shit, but I was just out.

7095
04:22:57,323 --> 04:22:59,746
MARISHA: That was when I was a spider tiger.

7096
04:22:59,746 --> 04:23:01,531
'Cause I cast Spider Climb on myself,

7097
04:23:01,531 --> 04:23:02,546
and I was in tiger form,

7098
04:23:02,546 --> 04:23:04,402
so I was spider climbing
all over the place.

7099
04:23:04,402 --> 04:23:05,756
MATT: That's also one of my
favorite risky rolls,

7100
04:23:05,756 --> 04:23:07,416
which was after that happened,

7101
04:23:07,416 --> 04:23:10,251
Tiberius, you pushed the
umber hulk onto the ground,

7102
04:23:10,251 --> 04:23:11,778
or through the hole, it fell.

7103
04:23:11,778 --> 04:23:13,532
ORION: I had this amazing spell with Pathfinder

7104
04:23:13,532 --> 04:23:17,163
called Aquasphere, orb, and you can like,

7105
04:23:17,163 --> 04:23:19,355
capture large creatures.

7106
04:23:19,355 --> 04:23:21,657
I literally can waterbend a sphere

7107
04:23:21,657 --> 04:23:23,943
and carry this dude and drop them down,

7108
04:23:23,943 --> 04:23:26,751
it was amazing, I miss it so much.

7109
04:23:26,751 --> 04:23:28,334
Continue the story.

7110
04:23:29,709 --> 04:23:32,021
MATT: So essentially Tiberius decided,

7111
04:23:32,021 --> 04:23:33,206
'cause Grog was unconscious,

7112
04:23:33,206 --> 04:23:34,507
and the creature was down there.

7113
04:23:34,507 --> 04:23:35,970
All of them were stuck 170 feet up,

7114
04:23:35,970 --> 04:23:38,632
in this little hive essentially.

7115
04:23:38,632 --> 04:23:40,765
Tiberius said fuck it, he
jumped out of the hole,

7116
04:23:40,765 --> 04:23:44,339
swan dove down, and cast
Featherfall on himself

7117
04:23:44,339 --> 04:23:45,172
at the last minute,

7118
04:23:45,172 --> 04:23:46,240
had to make a concentration check

7119
04:23:46,240 --> 04:23:47,455
because of the wind rushing past,

7120
04:23:47,455 --> 04:23:48,549
and having to cast a spell while falling.

7121
04:23:48,549 --> 04:23:50,037
It's a very difficult thing.

7122
04:23:50,037 --> 04:23:53,903
He had about a 40% chance of success,

7123
04:23:53,903 --> 04:23:56,223
60% chance of instant
death, and he made the roll.

7124
04:23:56,223 --> 04:24:00,396
I love risky moments like
that so much, I love 'em.

7125
04:24:00,396 --> 04:24:02,740
TRAVIS: It was pretty legit.

7126
04:24:02,740 --> 04:24:05,717
ORION: I did it again and held
that fucker, it was intense.

7127
04:24:05,717 --> 04:24:07,953
MARISHA: I'm wondering when we're
gonna face a beholder.

7128
04:24:07,953 --> 04:24:09,093
MATT: That'll be nasty.

7129
04:24:09,093 --> 04:24:11,737
MARISHA: That's my favorite D&amp;D monster.

7130
04:24:11,737 --> 04:24:13,312
ORION: With all the eyes?

7131
04:24:13,312 --> 04:24:16,514
MARISHA: They're like a big floating head

7132
04:24:16,514 --> 04:24:19,235
with a giant eye, and
they've got tentacles,

7133
04:24:19,235 --> 04:24:20,856
with eyes on the end of 'em,

7134
04:24:20,856 --> 04:24:25,194
and each eyeball does a
different ray of effect.

7135
04:24:25,194 --> 04:24:26,433
TRAVIS: A beholder?

7136
04:24:26,433 --> 04:24:27,975
MATT: Nasty.

7137
04:24:27,975 --> 04:24:29,454
TRAVIS: You know what that is too?

7138
04:24:29,454 --> 04:24:30,628
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: They're nasty.

7139
04:24:30,628 --> 04:24:31,461
ASHLEY: Bad news bears.

7140
04:24:31,461 --> 04:24:32,406
MARISHA: They're super awesome.

7141
04:24:32,406 --> 04:24:33,983
One of these days we're gonna fight one.

7142
04:24:33,983 --> 04:24:35,221
MATT: One of these days.

7143
04:24:35,221 --> 04:24:38,511
LIAM: They're a signature character
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

7144
04:24:38,511 --> 04:24:39,870
They represent D&amp;D.

7145
04:24:39,870 --> 04:24:42,639
TRAVIS: What made the dwarves get
bigger today in the battle?

7146
04:24:42,639 --> 04:24:44,818
MATT: That's actually an ability of the duergar.

7147
04:24:44,818 --> 04:24:45,651
LIAM: Viagra.

7148
04:24:45,651 --> 04:24:46,783
MATT: Yeah.

7149
04:24:46,783 --> 04:24:50,206
They can summon through
sheer force of will,

7150
04:24:50,206 --> 04:24:52,027
and just the way they've
been bred over time,

7151
04:24:52,027 --> 04:24:54,222
they can increase their
form for a short time

7152
04:24:54,222 --> 04:24:55,935
to increase their damage,

7153
04:24:55,935 --> 04:24:58,495
and be just a general asshole, so.

7154
04:24:58,495 --> 04:25:00,065
It's an ability the duergar have.

7155
04:25:00,065 --> 04:25:01,243
TRAVIS: Long lost son.

7156
04:25:01,243 --> 04:25:04,038
LIAM: I'm gonna guess that none
of us have been to Sweden?

7157
04:25:04,038 --> 04:25:04,871
MATT: I have.

7158
04:25:04,871 --> 04:25:06,515
ASHLEY: My dad was from Sweden.

7159
04:25:06,515 --> 04:25:08,419
MATT: That's awesome. I've been to Gothenberg.

7160
04:25:08,419 --> 04:25:09,275
TALIESIN: That's not surprising.

7161
04:25:09,275 --> 04:25:10,806
ORION: I have not, but I would like to go.

7162
04:25:10,806 --> 04:25:12,692
MARISHA: Yeah, who wouldn't
want to go to Sweden?

7163
04:25:12,692 --> 04:25:14,188
LIAM: Makes sense.

7164
04:25:14,188 --> 04:25:15,481
Pale and blonde.

7165
04:25:15,481 --> 04:25:16,864
MATT: Have you been?

7166
04:25:16,864 --> 04:25:17,697
ASHLEY: Never been.

7167
04:25:17,697 --> 04:25:20,507
MATT: It's beautiful, I spent two
weeks in Gothenberg, Sweden,

7168
04:25:20,507 --> 04:25:21,999
on business years ago.

7169
04:25:21,999 --> 04:25:23,543
It was gorgeous.

7170
04:25:23,543 --> 04:25:24,633
Food was amazing.

7171
04:25:24,633 --> 04:25:25,512
Nothing like walking down the street

7172
04:25:25,512 --> 04:25:27,867
and seeing a giant gothic stone structure

7173
04:25:27,867 --> 04:25:29,683
with an archway and a gargoyle perched,

7174
04:25:29,683 --> 04:25:32,367
and you walk in and it's a 7-Eleven.

7175
04:25:32,367 --> 04:25:33,512
It's pretty hilarious.

7176
04:25:33,512 --> 04:25:34,652
All the architecture there is old,

7177
04:25:34,652 --> 04:25:36,897
but it's been repurposed, it's great.

7178
04:25:36,897 --> 04:25:38,722
LIAM: If you had to choose

7179
04:25:38,722 --> 04:25:40,302
would you pick to receive an extra level,

7180
04:25:40,302 --> 04:25:41,495
or Matt's hair?

7181
04:25:41,495 --> 04:25:43,022
MATT: God damn it.
LIAM: Matt's hair.

7182
04:25:43,022 --> 04:25:44,151
(all laugh)

7183
04:25:44,151 --> 04:25:46,037
ASHLEY: Hair, obviously.

7184
04:25:46,037 --> 04:25:47,421
MARISHA: Receive an extra level or Matt's hair.

7185
04:25:47,421 --> 04:25:51,245
TRAVIS: You can't get hair like
this without unicorn blood.

7186
04:25:51,245 --> 04:25:52,810
My God.

7187
04:25:52,810 --> 04:25:53,743
MATT: I'm gonna shave my head one of these days.

7188
04:25:53,743 --> 04:25:56,937
LIAM: Shave his head, he can't DM anymore.

7189
04:25:56,937 --> 04:25:58,123
MATT: I'd wither.

7190
04:25:58,123 --> 04:25:58,956
It's like Sampson.

7191
04:25:58,956 --> 04:26:00,717
I would just like become
this little raisin,

7192
04:26:00,717 --> 04:26:01,792
I'd be David Tennant.

7193
04:26:01,792 --> 04:26:05,793
LIAM: The beholder strikes for the-- mawp. Mawp.

7194
04:26:09,837 --> 04:26:11,233
MATT: Let's see.

7195
04:26:11,233 --> 04:26:12,954
What are the questions we got up there?

7196
04:26:12,954 --> 04:26:14,608
MARISHA: It is 11:38, by the way.

7197
04:26:14,608 --> 04:26:17,217
LIAM: What is the most outrageous
and unexpected thing

7198
04:26:17,217 --> 04:26:19,266
to come from a natural 20?

7199
04:26:19,266 --> 04:26:20,914
That was Scanlan.

7200
04:26:20,914 --> 04:26:22,258
ASHLEY: Probably the--

7201
04:26:22,258 --> 04:26:24,367
LIAM: Scanlan as Burt Reynolds.

7202
04:26:24,367 --> 04:26:25,378
MARISHA: Oh right.

7203
04:26:25,378 --> 04:26:29,545
MATT: We'll take about five
more minutes of questions.

7204
04:26:30,580 --> 04:26:31,538
Five or ten more minutes of questions,

7205
04:26:31,538 --> 04:26:32,371
then we gotta take off.

7206
04:26:32,371 --> 04:26:33,625
LIAM: How long will you be doing this show?

7207
04:26:33,625 --> 04:26:34,458
30 years.

7208
04:26:35,971 --> 04:26:38,675
MATT: Considering we've been playing
for two and a half years,

7209
04:26:38,675 --> 04:26:40,284
and everyone's level nine,

7210
04:26:40,284 --> 04:26:44,250
we can keep going for quite some time.

7211
04:26:44,250 --> 04:26:46,273
Whether or not we continue past that,

7212
04:26:46,273 --> 04:26:48,165
means either we do a new campaign,

7213
04:26:48,165 --> 04:26:51,968
or we go into epic or mythic levels?

7214
04:26:51,968 --> 04:26:54,916
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

7215
04:26:54,916 --> 04:26:55,763
I mean, I'd love to keep playing

7216
04:26:55,763 --> 04:26:56,746
for as long as people wanna play,

7217
04:26:56,746 --> 04:26:58,265
but also people get busy, life changes,

7218
04:26:58,265 --> 04:26:59,611
we'll see how it goes.

7219
04:26:59,611 --> 04:27:02,414
I'm in for the long haul as
much as everyone else is.

7220
04:27:02,414 --> 04:27:04,717
LIAM: Matt, multiple people are
asking what the music is

7221
04:27:04,717 --> 04:27:06,615
that we're hearing on the show.

7222
04:27:06,615 --> 04:27:08,909
MATT: What you hear in the
show is a combination of

7223
04:27:08,909 --> 04:27:10,386
a gentlemen named Kevin Macleod,

7224
04:27:10,386 --> 04:27:13,423
who has a website called Incompetech,

7225
04:27:13,423 --> 04:27:15,837
which he produces really amazing,

7226
04:27:15,837 --> 04:27:17,561
royalty-free musical tracks.

7227
04:27:17,561 --> 04:27:20,134
I've used them for many
web series for many years.

7228
04:27:20,134 --> 04:27:21,283
He's very talented, and I contacted him,

7229
04:27:21,283 --> 04:27:22,597
and asked him permission
to use on the stream.

7230
04:27:22,597 --> 04:27:24,935
He's like, "yeah, anything
on Twitch, go for it."

7231
04:27:24,935 --> 04:27:28,410
And the other half are a
lot of soundscapes I use

7232
04:27:28,410 --> 04:27:30,007
from a company called Platemail Games,

7233
04:27:30,007 --> 04:27:33,186
which make great custom RPG soundscapes,

7234
04:27:33,186 --> 04:27:36,034
and some tracks that are just creepy,

7235
04:27:36,034 --> 04:27:39,636
and dwarf cityscapes,
and dark forest night.

7236
04:27:39,636 --> 04:27:41,922
It's a great, great resource.

7237
04:27:41,922 --> 04:27:45,728
Those are my two big ones
for this Twitch stream.

7238
04:27:45,728 --> 04:27:47,858
ORION: And yes, we did roll
for our starting stats.

7239
04:27:47,858 --> 04:27:51,432
MATT: Yeah it was 4d6, drop the lowest,

7240
04:27:51,432 --> 04:27:52,314
arrange as desired.

7241
04:27:52,314 --> 04:27:55,452
So it was a powerful campaign.

7242
04:27:55,452 --> 04:27:57,316
LIAM: What was the most nail-biting moment

7243
04:27:57,316 --> 04:27:58,286
the group has seen?

7244
04:27:58,286 --> 04:27:59,119
It was Pike's death.

7245
04:27:59,119 --> 04:27:59,952
MARISHA: Pike dying.

7246
04:27:59,952 --> 04:28:01,035
MATT: Definitely.

7247
04:28:04,685 --> 04:28:05,752
Do you prefer being the DM,

7248
04:28:05,752 --> 04:28:07,062
or do you like mixing it
up and being characters?

7249
04:28:07,062 --> 04:28:09,084
I never get a chance to play games really.

7250
04:28:09,084 --> 04:28:10,451
It's kind of one of those, always a DM,

7251
04:28:10,451 --> 04:28:12,698
never a bride circumstance.

7252
04:28:12,698 --> 04:28:13,550
LIAM: You wanna play with my kid?

7253
04:28:13,550 --> 04:28:14,776
MATT: Yeah.

7254
04:28:14,776 --> 04:28:16,261
I'll be an evil character
and murder them all,

7255
04:28:16,261 --> 04:28:17,670
you're going to regret it immediately,

7256
04:28:17,670 --> 04:28:18,560
make 'em just cry.

7257
04:28:18,560 --> 04:28:20,354
LIAM: "Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"

7258
04:28:20,354 --> 04:28:22,267
MATT: Yeah, turn it into Mazes and Monsters.

7259
04:28:22,267 --> 04:28:23,640
TALIESIN: Is that why you play so much War Machine,

7260
04:28:23,640 --> 04:28:26,267
is because for once you
don't have to be responsible?

7261
04:28:26,267 --> 04:28:27,184
MATT: Probably.

7262
04:28:28,091 --> 04:28:29,160
I occasionally,

7263
04:28:29,160 --> 04:28:30,812
I got to play a game of
Diaspora for a while,

7264
04:28:30,812 --> 04:28:33,156
with Philip Eisner, the guy
who wrote Event Horizon.

7265
04:28:33,156 --> 04:28:37,239
So playing a sci-fi kind
of horror-based universe

7266
04:28:38,763 --> 04:28:39,982
with him running, that was great.

7267
04:28:39,982 --> 04:28:40,854
That was very brief.

7268
04:28:40,854 --> 04:28:43,976
LIAM: Matt, can you give us any
teasers of things to come?

7269
04:28:43,976 --> 04:28:44,830
MATT: No.

7270
04:28:46,681 --> 04:28:47,762
See as they happen, man,

7271
04:28:47,762 --> 04:28:49,537
that's part of the fun,
the mystery of it all.

7272
04:28:49,537 --> 04:28:50,775
I know what's coming.

7273
04:28:50,775 --> 04:28:52,658
I got stuff planned for years.

7274
04:28:52,658 --> 04:28:53,491
It's gonna be fun.

7275
04:28:53,491 --> 04:28:56,476
LIAM: Do you have any advice
to get into voice acting?

7276
04:28:56,476 --> 04:28:59,068
Learn to act, study acting,
go to where the work is,

7277
04:28:59,068 --> 04:29:02,967
keep acting, in anything,
in fucking anything.

7278
04:29:02,967 --> 04:29:04,477
Go to where the work is.

7279
04:29:06,622 --> 04:29:07,455
Act.

7280
04:29:09,703 --> 04:29:10,836
MATT: What age did you play your first

7281
04:29:10,836 --> 04:29:12,327
tabletop RPG game?

7282
04:29:12,327 --> 04:29:14,536
For me it was Second
Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons,

7283
04:29:14,536 --> 04:29:16,542
and it was freshman year of high school.

7284
04:29:16,542 --> 04:29:18,010
TALIESIN: GURPS, 13.

7285
04:29:18,010 --> 04:29:21,406
I was, yeah, 13 years old, GURPS.

7286
04:29:21,406 --> 04:29:23,562
ASHLEY: Favorite tabletop games, not D&amp;D?

7287
04:29:23,562 --> 04:29:24,974
LIAM: Get Hulk Hogan to play.

7288
04:29:24,974 --> 04:29:25,807
ORION: That's not D&amp;D?

7289
04:29:25,807 --> 04:29:27,649
TALIESIN: Mansions of Madness.

7290
04:29:27,649 --> 04:29:29,556
MARISHA: Mansions of Madness is great.

7291
04:29:29,556 --> 04:29:32,383
ORION: Is MTG, Magic the Gathering a tabletop?

7292
04:29:32,383 --> 04:29:33,289
Is that considered tabletop?

7293
04:29:33,289 --> 04:29:35,622
MARISHA: It's a card building game.

7294
04:29:36,538 --> 04:29:37,371
ORION: Magic.

7295
04:29:38,389 --> 04:29:39,652
MARISHA: War Machine.

7296
04:29:39,652 --> 04:29:41,278
MATT: War Machine is really fun.

7297
04:29:41,278 --> 04:29:43,171
MARISHA: I'm a Cryx player.

7298
04:29:43,171 --> 04:29:44,246
MATT: It's awesome.

7299
04:29:44,246 --> 04:29:45,977
ASHLEY: I'm just starting.

7300
04:29:45,977 --> 04:29:46,967
MATT: You're the awesome Retribution.

7301
04:29:46,967 --> 04:29:49,428
ORION: I'm Circle of Orboros.

7302
04:29:55,277 --> 04:29:57,750
TALIESIN: We played with Scanlan, of course we do.

7303
04:29:57,750 --> 04:29:59,226
TRAVIS: It said do you ever think about sexuality

7304
04:29:59,226 --> 04:30:01,653
while playing, besides Grog, of course.

7305
04:30:01,653 --> 04:30:04,462
Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have.

7306
04:30:04,462 --> 04:30:06,050
TALIESIN: It's hard not to think about it with Sam.

7307
04:30:06,050 --> 04:30:08,278
TRAVIS: We just pay for it.

7308
04:30:08,278 --> 04:30:10,374
LIAM: Are we gonna release more
background information

7309
04:30:10,374 --> 04:30:11,688
of your campaign?

7310
04:30:11,688 --> 04:30:12,666
MATT: Yes, actually.

7311
04:30:12,666 --> 04:30:13,499
LIAM: We are?

7312
04:30:14,591 --> 04:30:18,584
MATT: Time has been hard, but
I'm trudging through.

7313
04:30:18,584 --> 04:30:20,731
What I'm gonna make
essentially is a video recap

7314
04:30:20,731 --> 04:30:23,439
of the previous two and a
half years of the campaign.

7315
04:30:23,439 --> 04:30:25,640
I'm gonna narrate it,
it's gonna be very simple.

7316
04:30:25,640 --> 04:30:26,542
It's gonna be just information,

7317
04:30:26,542 --> 04:30:29,067
with the occasional slides
of stuff in the background.

7318
04:30:29,067 --> 04:30:30,436
But I'm working on a video,

7319
04:30:30,436 --> 04:30:31,726
kind of like your guys' intros,

7320
04:30:31,726 --> 04:30:34,914
that'll be a synopsis of the story

7321
04:30:34,914 --> 04:30:36,716
up until this stream stared.

7322
04:30:36,716 --> 04:30:37,983
TRAVIS: Claymation, that's awesome, man.

7323
04:30:37,983 --> 04:30:41,148
MATT: I will destroy you, I
will fucking stab you.

7324
04:30:41,148 --> 04:30:43,565
LIAM: If you want, it's not much,

7325
04:30:44,635 --> 04:30:47,946
but I have a Vine account
that's under the name

7326
04:30:47,946 --> 04:30:51,779
VoiceofOBrien, and I
took a lot of Vine videos

7327
04:30:53,050 --> 04:30:54,064
from our private game.

7328
04:30:54,064 --> 04:30:55,243
So it's not a ton,

7329
04:30:55,243 --> 04:30:57,334
but you'll see us acting like shitheads.

7330
04:30:57,334 --> 04:30:58,827
TRAVIS: That's seven seconds at a time.

7331
04:30:58,827 --> 04:31:00,572
MARISHA: Seven seconds at a time, yeah.

7332
04:31:00,572 --> 04:31:01,541
I think I still have the video

7333
04:31:01,541 --> 04:31:04,265
of you trying to woo the nymph lady.

7334
04:31:04,265 --> 04:31:06,848
TRAVIS: Try?
TALIESIN: That was a good video.

7335
04:31:08,160 --> 04:31:10,175
MARISHA: It's basically just you
flirting with my boyfriend.

7336
04:31:10,175 --> 04:31:11,996
TALIESIN: I have some videos of the tarot game,

7337
04:31:11,996 --> 04:31:14,098
and a couple of us

7338
04:31:14,098 --> 04:31:15,990
TRAVIS: Matt is now a nymph.

7339
04:31:15,990 --> 04:31:17,573
MATT: Yeah, we sat there, and, hey man,

7340
04:31:17,573 --> 04:31:19,536
I've had to flirt with
quite a few of these people

7341
04:31:19,536 --> 04:31:21,904
as characters, it's interesting.

7342
04:31:21,904 --> 04:31:25,753
LIAM: Who's your favorite NPC that
you brought to life for us?

7343
04:31:25,753 --> 04:31:27,831
MATT: Oh, that's a tough one.

7344
04:31:27,831 --> 04:31:28,743
There's been a lot of good ones.

7345
04:31:28,743 --> 04:31:31,876
I really enjoyed Grimthorn,
the dwarf that was--

7346
04:31:31,876 --> 04:31:32,826
LIAM: Clarota is pretty good.

7347
04:31:32,826 --> 04:31:34,251
MATT: Yeah, Clarota is great.

7348
04:31:34,251 --> 04:31:36,948
He was the one eyed dwarf with the shave,

7349
04:31:36,948 --> 04:31:38,500
that was taking you guys
to the fighting ring.

7350
04:31:38,500 --> 04:31:39,333
He was fun.

7351
04:31:39,333 --> 04:31:42,150
I'm enjoying Balgus as
well, he's a good one.

7352
04:31:42,150 --> 04:31:42,983
MARISHA: Ballsack.

7353
04:31:42,983 --> 04:31:43,900
LIAM: Ballsack.

7354
04:31:46,177 --> 04:31:48,847
MARISHA: Do we have nicknames for all of our NPCs?

7355
04:31:48,847 --> 04:31:52,637
MATT: You know, I really enjoy
Arcanist Allura Visoren.

7356
04:31:52,637 --> 04:31:53,470
ORION: So do I!

7357
04:31:53,470 --> 04:31:57,637
MATT: She's an awesome, powerful,
headstrong elven sorceress,

7358
04:31:58,969 --> 04:32:02,045
who is part of a, not a secret,

7359
04:32:02,045 --> 04:32:05,992
but a very powerful circle
of magic practitioners

7360
04:32:05,992 --> 04:32:06,825
around the world,

7361
04:32:06,825 --> 04:32:08,520
and also a member of
the council of Tal'Dorei.

7362
04:32:08,520 --> 04:32:10,479
She's one of the largest
allies that this group

7363
04:32:10,479 --> 04:32:12,551
has had through a lot
of the adventure arcs,

7364
04:32:12,551 --> 04:32:14,861
and I love playing her, she's great.

7365
04:32:14,861 --> 04:32:17,624
LIAM: Grog, have you even thrown
a gnome as an attack.

7366
04:32:17,624 --> 04:32:19,062
TRAVIS: The very first time we played,

7367
04:32:19,062 --> 04:32:21,609
I picked up Sam and
chucked him across a room.

7368
04:32:21,609 --> 04:32:23,010
That was full of a trap.

7369
04:32:23,010 --> 04:32:24,093
MARISHA: Fastball special.

7370
04:32:25,017 --> 04:32:26,851
TRAVIS: And it worked.

7371
04:32:26,851 --> 04:32:28,024
It was awesome.

7372
04:32:28,024 --> 04:32:28,872
MATT: What character type would I play

7373
04:32:28,872 --> 04:32:29,908
if I ever got a chance to play?

7374
04:32:29,908 --> 04:32:32,641
I would probably be a bard.

7375
04:32:32,641 --> 04:32:36,528
I wanna make a bard that
actually conducts the battle.

7376
04:32:36,528 --> 04:32:38,873
Meaning, sits there and watches the fight,

7377
04:32:38,873 --> 04:32:40,159
and he's conducting,

7378
04:32:40,159 --> 04:32:41,784
like music happens when
other people attack.

7379
04:32:41,784 --> 04:32:44,029
Cymbals go off, and drum beats,

7380
04:32:44,029 --> 04:32:46,235
and all of his abilities are tied to music,

7381
04:32:46,235 --> 04:32:48,602
so he's actually conducting
the battle like a symphony.

7382
04:32:48,602 --> 04:32:49,527
That's what I wanna make.

7383
04:32:49,527 --> 04:32:50,360
MARISHA: That's cool.

7384
04:32:50,360 --> 04:32:52,099
ASHLEY: That's badass.

7385
04:32:52,099 --> 04:32:53,723
MATT: One day.

7386
04:32:53,723 --> 04:32:55,775
LIAM: Would you ever play an evil character?

7387
04:32:55,775 --> 04:32:58,527
My contingency plan, if I get killed,

7388
04:32:58,527 --> 04:32:59,490
I don't know about evil,

7389
04:32:59,490 --> 04:33:02,704
but he won't be as nice as Vax.

7390
04:33:02,704 --> 04:33:04,508
MATT: Evil characters have to
be discussed with the DM.

7391
04:33:04,508 --> 04:33:06,376
I'm iffy on the evil character,

7392
04:33:06,376 --> 04:33:07,582
unless they have a good reason,

7393
04:33:07,582 --> 04:33:09,451
and a personality that isn't going to

7394
04:33:09,451 --> 04:33:11,136
completely derail the campaign.

7395
04:33:11,136 --> 04:33:12,734
Doing an evil campaign, that's fine.

7396
04:33:12,734 --> 04:33:14,573
But if you're building a character

7397
04:33:14,573 --> 04:33:16,044
that is going to inherently be a troll,

7398
04:33:16,044 --> 04:33:17,374
and basically diminish everybody else's

7399
04:33:17,374 --> 04:33:20,505
good time in the story,
it becomes a problem.

7400
04:33:20,505 --> 04:33:21,685
ZAC: It's the internet though, man.

7401
04:33:21,685 --> 04:33:22,540
MATT: I know.

7402
04:33:22,540 --> 04:33:24,903
If you make a cool,
interesting evil character,

7403
04:33:24,903 --> 04:33:26,505
that can be evil but still like,

7404
04:33:26,505 --> 04:33:28,990
like a good example would
be in Baldur's Gate, Edwin.

7405
04:33:28,990 --> 04:33:30,679
ZAC: What if one of your guests,

7406
04:33:30,679 --> 04:33:33,777
that came on for one night,
would they be allowed to be?

7407
04:33:33,777 --> 04:33:34,882
MATT: Yeah, they'd be allowed to.

7408
04:33:34,882 --> 04:33:37,228
They may not survive.

7409
04:33:37,228 --> 04:33:39,187
ORION: Tiberius might not--

7410
04:33:39,187 --> 04:33:40,144
MARISHA: Or kill them.

7411
04:33:40,144 --> 04:33:42,708
LIAM: I don't know about evil,
but if I have to come back,

7412
04:33:42,708 --> 04:33:44,968
I might be a lot more selfish.

7413
04:33:44,968 --> 04:33:46,583
MATT: In it cool news, tabletop columnist,

7414
04:33:46,583 --> 04:33:48,838
offering to DM a game for me.

7415
04:33:48,838 --> 04:33:50,761
I may have to hit you
up on that some time.

7416
04:33:50,761 --> 04:33:52,339
'Cause that'd be awesome.

7417
04:33:52,339 --> 04:33:54,171
TALIESIN: He deserves a break.

7418
04:33:55,170 --> 04:33:56,564
ZAC: How do you remember all the voices

7419
04:33:56,564 --> 04:33:57,930
that you've done of the
NPC's over the years?

7420
04:33:57,930 --> 04:34:00,509
MATT: I make notes and audio files.

7421
04:34:00,509 --> 04:34:01,343
TRAVIS: You do?

7422
04:34:01,343 --> 04:34:02,176
MATT: I do.

7423
04:34:02,176 --> 04:34:03,087
As a reminder in case I forget.

7424
04:34:03,087 --> 04:34:04,039
TRAVIS: Jarvis.

7425
04:34:04,039 --> 04:34:05,633
(all laugh)

7426
04:34:05,633 --> 04:34:07,280
MATT: I have notes written next to every NPC,

7427
04:34:07,280 --> 04:34:09,420
like an accent or dialect
that I chose for them,

7428
04:34:09,420 --> 04:34:10,785
a general texture.

7429
04:34:10,785 --> 04:34:12,117
Kind of like what you'd see for breakdowns

7430
04:34:12,117 --> 04:34:13,639
for a character you're auditioning for.

7431
04:34:13,639 --> 04:34:14,808
I basically make that for each NPC

7432
04:34:14,808 --> 04:34:16,165
to remind me of what I've done.

7433
04:34:16,165 --> 04:34:17,634
And if it's a particularly weird voice

7434
04:34:17,634 --> 04:34:19,736
that I don't know if I could
replicate in the future,

7435
04:34:19,736 --> 04:34:21,502
after the session I'll go
and do a little audio file

7436
04:34:21,502 --> 04:34:23,429
of me doing the voice so
I can go back to it later.

7437
04:34:23,429 --> 04:34:24,848
TRAVIS: You're a freak of nature, man.

7438
04:34:24,848 --> 04:34:25,848
TALIESIN: Seriously.

7439
04:34:27,826 --> 04:34:28,659
MATT: Good question.

7440
04:34:28,659 --> 04:34:29,491
MARISHA: There's a lot that goes into it.

7441
04:34:29,491 --> 04:34:31,800
I think Matt, just to
put it into perspective,

7442
04:34:31,800 --> 04:34:32,862
for everyone in the chat room,

7443
04:34:32,862 --> 04:34:36,098
I think Matt probably
spends close to eight hours,

7444
04:34:36,098 --> 04:34:39,840
at least, on each time before we play.

7445
04:34:39,840 --> 04:34:41,831
Or I guess at least we used to.

7446
04:34:41,831 --> 04:34:42,665
MATT: For our big session,

7447
04:34:42,665 --> 04:34:44,476
I'd spend as much time
preparing as we did playing.

7448
04:34:44,476 --> 04:34:45,310
I'll put it that way,

7449
04:34:45,310 --> 04:34:46,304
I spend as much time preparing as we play.

7450
04:34:46,304 --> 04:34:47,205
So for these sessions,

7451
04:34:47,205 --> 04:34:48,653
I'm spending about three hours a week,

7452
04:34:48,653 --> 04:34:50,585
preparing, what, three to four hours a week?

7453
04:34:50,585 --> 04:34:52,088
For old sessions that was bigger.

7454
04:34:52,088 --> 04:34:54,651
LIAM: Someone asked, what was the
reaction to discovering

7455
04:34:54,651 --> 04:34:56,174
you had a magic flying carpet?

7456
04:34:56,174 --> 04:34:59,094
Which you can see if you
go to Matt's YouTube channel.

7457
04:34:59,094 --> 04:35:01,655
There's a video that
Ashley made of us playing,

7458
04:35:01,655 --> 04:35:03,970
and you see our reactions to that.

7459
04:35:03,970 --> 04:35:07,029
MARISHA: Who was it, was it you, or Vex?

7460
04:35:07,029 --> 04:35:10,002
That tried to float down with the carpet,

7461
04:35:10,002 --> 04:35:13,043
and then we realized it was magic?

7462
04:35:13,043 --> 04:35:14,207
LIAM: Yeah, underneath.

7463
04:35:14,207 --> 04:35:16,190
MARISHA: But we tried to just
use it like a parachute.

7464
04:35:16,190 --> 04:35:18,232
MATT: It was a crumbling tower,
it was Allura's tower.

7465
04:35:18,232 --> 04:35:19,874
You guys went into,
realized she was missing,

7466
04:35:19,874 --> 04:35:21,901
because the tower had been attacked.

7467
04:35:21,901 --> 04:35:23,754
You set off essentially a defense system

7468
04:35:23,754 --> 04:35:25,770
of her arcane tower,

7469
04:35:25,770 --> 04:35:28,325
which caused it to
crumble into a tiny pearl.

7470
04:35:28,325 --> 04:35:29,743
ORION: Tiberius jumped out the window

7471
04:35:29,743 --> 04:35:30,848
and just cast Featherfall.

7472
04:35:30,848 --> 04:35:32,507
MATT: Yeah, and just kinda glided away.

7473
04:35:32,507 --> 04:35:34,538
You turned into an eagle
and grabbed the gnomes.

7474
04:35:34,538 --> 04:35:36,519
The rest of the party had to try

7475
04:35:36,519 --> 04:35:38,810
to rapidly escape a crumbling tower

7476
04:35:38,810 --> 04:35:40,481
that was compacting on to itself.

7477
04:35:40,481 --> 04:35:43,493
MARISHA: I think it was mainly
the twins in the tower.

7478
04:35:43,493 --> 04:35:45,493
LIAM: Hey, Grog almost died once.

7479
04:35:47,045 --> 04:35:49,241
He fell from a great--

7480
04:35:49,241 --> 04:35:50,784
MATT: You fall a lot, but when
you fall on to something,

7481
04:35:50,784 --> 04:35:52,534
that thing is fucked.

7482
04:35:54,643 --> 04:35:55,865
MATT: All right, we're winding down here,

7483
04:35:55,865 --> 04:35:57,449
'cause we gotta leave here shortly guys.

7484
04:35:57,449 --> 04:35:58,408
Two more questions.

7485
04:35:58,408 --> 04:35:59,512
LIAM: Three more questions.

7486
04:35:59,512 --> 04:36:00,930
ZAC: Closing messages
before you guys go, too.

7487
04:36:00,930 --> 04:36:02,504
MATT: Oh yeah, all right, so we'll
do a couple more questions,

7488
04:36:02,504 --> 04:36:04,252
then we'll go to closing messages.

7489
04:36:04,252 --> 04:36:05,437
Who wants to pick?

7490
04:36:05,437 --> 04:36:06,518
LIAM: Let's make it a magic three.

7491
04:36:06,518 --> 04:36:07,534
MARISHA: Let's do a good one.

7492
04:36:07,534 --> 04:36:11,502
MATT: Three, three questions, make 'em quick.

7493
04:36:11,502 --> 04:36:12,502
Let's see.

7494
04:36:16,979 --> 04:36:18,863
MARISHA: Waiting for a good one.

7495
04:36:18,863 --> 04:36:20,080
MATT: How much does Grog weigh?

7496
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:22,598
Grog weighs approximately
600 pound we decided.

7497
04:36:22,598 --> 04:36:24,442
TRAVIS: Just under 700.

7498
04:36:24,442 --> 04:36:26,275
MATT: So he's kinda rough.

7499
04:36:27,146 --> 04:36:28,569
TRAVIS: It's all muscle, bitch.

7500
04:36:28,569 --> 04:36:30,035
MATT: Yeah it is.

7501
04:36:30,035 --> 04:36:31,535
Muscle and brains.

7502
04:36:32,845 --> 04:36:34,345
TRAVIS: Muscle and wang.

7503
04:36:36,165 --> 04:36:37,529
500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang.

7504
04:36:37,529 --> 04:36:38,797
MATT: Any of you consider running a game

7505
04:36:38,797 --> 04:36:40,783
for fans of the stream?

7506
04:36:40,783 --> 04:36:43,086
Actually, I've run a couple
games at conventions

7507
04:36:43,086 --> 04:36:44,383
for some groups.

7508
04:36:44,383 --> 04:36:46,990
I had a couple of sessions I ran,

7509
04:36:46,990 --> 04:36:48,152
actually in conjunction with Wizards,

7510
04:36:48,152 --> 04:36:49,579
they sent stuff out for us.

7511
04:36:49,579 --> 04:36:50,492
TALIESIN: And for charity.

7512
04:36:50,492 --> 04:36:54,947
MATT: Yeah, we've had some charity
D&amp;D games out here in L.A.

7513
04:36:54,947 --> 04:36:55,779
So we've done them before.

7514
04:36:55,779 --> 04:36:57,719
I'd consider it if there
was time available,

7515
04:36:57,719 --> 04:36:59,331
and a venue that allowed it.

7516
04:36:59,331 --> 04:37:00,859
So if it does happen,

7517
04:37:00,859 --> 04:37:03,692
we'll definitely announce it here.

7518
04:37:05,017 --> 04:37:07,018
TRAVIS: Best item in your inventory?

7519
04:37:07,018 --> 04:37:08,536
ORION: That's for a magic item?

7520
04:37:08,536 --> 04:37:10,118
TRAVIS: Oh, did we already say that?

7521
04:37:10,118 --> 04:37:10,952
I'm just blanking.

7522
04:37:10,952 --> 04:37:11,785
ORION: No.

7523
04:37:13,432 --> 04:37:15,432
TALIESIN: It's hard to read this quickly.

7524
04:37:15,432 --> 04:37:16,648
MATT: You guys have some good questions.

7525
04:37:16,648 --> 04:37:18,124
TRAVIS: My brain's turning into applesauce.

7526
04:37:18,124 --> 04:37:19,541
ASHLEY: I know, me too.

7527
04:37:22,732 --> 04:37:25,261
LIAM: Do you realize how lucky you all are

7528
04:37:25,261 --> 04:37:27,451
to have such a nice group of friends?

7529
04:37:27,451 --> 04:37:28,458
ALL: Yes.

7530
04:37:28,458 --> 04:37:29,669
MATT: Very much so.

7531
04:37:29,669 --> 04:37:31,849
TALIESIN: The world is cold and unfeeling.

7532
04:37:31,849 --> 04:37:33,713
LIAM: Let's close it on that.

7533
04:37:33,713 --> 04:37:35,237
I love these guys.

7534
04:37:35,237 --> 04:37:38,011
MATT: And I like to think that this is,

7535
04:37:38,011 --> 04:37:39,666
because there are so many good
people out there in the world,

7536
04:37:39,666 --> 04:37:41,886
and we were lucky enough
to find each other

7537
04:37:41,886 --> 04:37:42,936
through weird circumstances.

7538
04:37:42,936 --> 04:37:44,832
And there are so many good
people in the world out there,

7539
04:37:44,832 --> 04:37:45,978
don't close yourself off to it.

7540
04:37:45,978 --> 04:37:48,169
You'd be surprised how many awesome--

7541
04:37:48,169 --> 04:37:49,372
TRAVIS: How long does it usually take
the woman in the back

7542
04:37:49,372 --> 04:37:51,215
to tie her boot?

7543
04:37:51,215 --> 04:37:53,832
MARISHA: I'm multi-tasking.

7544
04:37:53,832 --> 04:37:55,732
MATT: No, that's the question we end it on.

7545
04:37:55,732 --> 04:37:57,797
That's the question.

7546
04:37:57,797 --> 04:37:59,145
MARISHA: I've just been tightening my laces

7547
04:37:59,145 --> 04:38:01,075
while I've been kicking it back here.

7548
04:38:01,075 --> 04:38:02,935
ZAC: I'm gonna squeeze in here really quick.

7549
04:38:08,277 --> 04:38:11,078
So I have some thank
you's I wanna call out

7550
04:38:11,078 --> 04:38:12,618
while you guys are here.

7551
04:38:12,618 --> 04:38:13,913
I figured they'd appreciate
me calling them out

7552
04:38:13,913 --> 04:38:16,689
the most while you guys were on screen.

7553
04:38:16,689 --> 04:38:18,848
'Cause they like you guys for some reason.

7554
04:38:18,848 --> 04:38:19,681
ALL: Aw.

7555
04:38:19,681 --> 04:38:22,106
ZAC: So these are all people
that have sent us stuff

7556
04:38:22,106 --> 04:38:25,688
off Amazon, to help
make the studio better.

7557
04:38:27,087 --> 04:38:28,587
So Danielle Denny.

7558
04:38:30,101 --> 04:38:31,672
ASHLEY: Thanks Danielle!

7559
04:38:31,672 --> 04:38:33,401
MATT: Danielle, thank you so much Danielle.

7560
04:38:33,401 --> 04:38:34,901
ZAC: Bradley Dealman?

7561
04:38:36,330 --> 04:38:37,163
MARISHA: Dalman.

7562
04:38:37,163 --> 04:38:38,439
MATT: Bradley Dalman.

7563
04:38:38,439 --> 04:38:39,430
LIAM: Do we know what they sent us?

7564
04:38:39,430 --> 04:38:40,982
Can you tell us some of
the things they sent?

7565
04:38:40,982 --> 04:38:42,556
ZAC: I have, I--

7566
04:38:42,556 --> 04:38:45,256
Well I mean they're like--

7567
04:38:45,256 --> 04:38:47,809
new microphones for
that station and lights.

7568
04:38:47,809 --> 04:38:48,749
MARISHA: That's amazing.

7569
04:38:48,749 --> 04:38:50,249
ZAC: Wii controllers.

7570
04:38:51,113 --> 04:38:54,395
MATT: Brad, thank you, that's amazing.

7571
04:38:54,395 --> 04:38:58,142
ZAC: And other stuff for tech we
needed that we didn't have.

7572
04:38:58,142 --> 04:39:00,578
Shane and Russell said thanks
for all your hard work,

7573
04:39:00,578 --> 04:39:01,938
and everything you are doing.

7574
04:39:01,938 --> 04:39:03,047
MATT: Aw.

7575
04:39:03,047 --> 04:39:03,881
Thank you Shane!

7576
04:39:03,881 --> 04:39:05,437
ZAC: Ty Odlinger.

7577
04:39:05,437 --> 04:39:06,871
ASHLEY: Ty!

7578
04:39:06,871 --> 04:39:08,274
ZAC: Timothy B. Hudson.

7579
04:39:08,274 --> 04:39:09,107
ASHLEY: Timothy!

7580
04:39:09,107 --> 04:39:11,252
ZAC: Timothy B. Hudson, he went nuts.

7581
04:39:11,252 --> 04:39:12,085
MATT: Timothy!

7582
04:39:13,524 --> 04:39:14,577
TALIESIN: Triple threat.

7583
04:39:14,577 --> 04:39:16,871
ZAC: Kathel T. Stockdale.

7584
04:39:16,871 --> 04:39:18,532
ASHLEY: Cool name, Kathel.

7585
04:39:18,532 --> 04:39:19,855
ZAC: Yeah, that's rad.

7586
04:39:19,855 --> 04:39:21,355
Luis Archuletta.

7587
04:39:22,537 --> 04:39:23,817
MATT: Luis Archeletta!

7588
04:39:23,817 --> 04:39:25,343
ASHLEY: Luis!

7589
04:39:25,343 --> 04:39:26,812
ZAC: Steve Chua.

7590
04:39:26,812 --> 04:39:27,646
MATT: Steve!

7591
04:39:27,646 --> 04:39:29,601
ZAC: Here's a little something
to help you guys out.

7592
04:39:29,601 --> 04:39:31,214
Another one from Chua,

7593
04:39:31,214 --> 04:39:32,373
here's a little something
to help you guys out.

7594
04:39:32,373 --> 04:39:33,332
And I know there's more coming in,

7595
04:39:33,332 --> 04:39:34,674
this is what we've got so far.

7596
04:39:34,674 --> 04:39:35,625
Thanks everybody.

7597
04:39:35,625 --> 04:39:37,108
MATT: That's so cool guys, thank you.

7598
04:39:37,108 --> 04:39:40,957
ZAC: And they also have asked
that a couple of you guys

7599
04:39:40,957 --> 04:39:42,916
come on Honesty Hour sometime.

7600
04:39:42,916 --> 04:39:43,825
LIAM: What is that?

7601
04:39:43,825 --> 04:39:46,825
ZAC: It's a show I do on Monday nights,

7602
04:39:48,067 --> 04:39:51,574
where it's 100% no-holds-barred.

7603
04:39:51,574 --> 04:39:54,237
I will answer any question that they ask.

7604
04:39:54,237 --> 04:39:55,070
TRAVIS: What?

7605
04:39:55,070 --> 04:39:56,270
ORION: I would love to do that.

7606
04:39:56,270 --> 04:39:58,253
TRAVIS: Sounds like a horrifying idea.

7607
04:39:58,253 --> 04:40:00,087
ZAC: Okay, they've asked
specifically for Ashley,

7608
04:40:00,087 --> 04:40:01,419
they've asked for Matt, and as for,

7609
04:40:01,419 --> 04:40:03,299
actually I think everyone has been asked

7610
04:40:03,299 --> 04:40:04,759
at one point in time.

7611
04:40:04,759 --> 04:40:07,047
So I'll say maybe I'll
have you guys once a month.

7612
04:40:07,047 --> 04:40:08,629
ASHLEY: When is Honesty Hour?

7613
04:40:08,629 --> 04:40:12,546
ZAC: It's usually Monday nights from nine to,

7614
04:40:12,546 --> 04:40:13,700
whenever the fuck.

7615
04:40:13,700 --> 04:40:16,044
Like it went to 1:30AM the other night.

7616
04:40:16,044 --> 04:40:17,411
CREW: Isn't it really an Honesty Time?

7617
04:40:17,411 --> 04:40:20,828
ZAC: Don't do it!

7618
04:40:24,322 --> 04:40:25,756
It's only for subscribers.

7619
04:40:25,756 --> 04:40:30,674
It's not that bad, because they
ask really great questions,

7620
04:40:30,674 --> 04:40:31,881
a lot of them have been about

7621
04:40:31,881 --> 04:40:34,404
how have you gotten through
certain aspects of depression,

7622
04:40:34,404 --> 04:40:36,393
or what kind of thing--

7623
04:40:36,393 --> 04:40:37,226
MARISHA: Oh that's good.

7624
04:40:37,226 --> 04:40:38,952
ZAC: It's pretty inspirational.

7625
04:40:38,952 --> 04:40:41,483
LIAM: How many times have you been
hit in the nuts in your life?

7626
04:40:41,483 --> 04:40:42,692
ZAC: I can say twice.

7627
04:40:42,692 --> 04:40:45,932
And would probably
explained how it happened,

7628
04:40:45,932 --> 04:40:46,765
and what I did.

7629
04:40:46,765 --> 04:40:48,478
It's just story time.

7630
04:40:48,478 --> 04:40:51,873
Sometimes the questions
get a little inappropriate.

7631
04:40:51,873 --> 04:40:53,039
MATT: That's okay.
ZAC: That's fine.

7632
04:40:53,039 --> 04:40:53,872
MATT: But like for the most part,

7633
04:40:53,872 --> 04:40:54,826
the audience here's been so awesome,

7634
04:40:54,826 --> 04:40:56,968
they're all super intelligent
with great questions.

7635
04:40:56,968 --> 04:40:58,382
I'd be down, I'd totally be down.

7636
04:40:58,382 --> 04:40:59,972
ASHLEY: Wait, is this Noncompliant?

7637
04:40:59,972 --> 04:41:00,835
ZAC: Yeah.

7638
04:41:00,835 --> 04:41:01,773
MATT: Oh, that's awesome.

7639
04:41:01,773 --> 04:41:04,479
Yeah, I got the Noncompliant
tattoo this week, actually.

7640
04:41:04,479 --> 04:41:05,436
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I saw your picture.

7641
04:41:05,436 --> 04:41:06,853
ASHLEY: That's amazing.

7642
04:41:07,909 --> 04:41:09,381
ZAC: We have a comic book show on Tuesday.

7643
04:41:09,381 --> 04:41:13,061
TRAVIS: (air-horn sound)

7644
04:41:13,061 --> 04:41:13,907
ZAC: Real talk with Zac.

7645
04:41:13,907 --> 04:41:16,046
But thank you guys so much for doing this.

7646
04:41:16,046 --> 04:41:17,307
The subscribers really wanted to do it,

7647
04:41:17,307 --> 04:41:19,980
so hopefully you guys enjoyed as well.

7648
04:41:19,980 --> 04:41:21,147
And we will

7649
04:41:22,743 --> 04:41:24,553
come back next week.

7650
04:41:24,553 --> 04:41:25,386
TRAVIS: Yeah!

7651
04:41:25,386 --> 04:41:26,219
ASHLEY: Yay!

7652
04:41:27,899 --> 04:41:31,297
ZAC: Tomorrow, if you guys are at Wonder Con,

7653
04:41:31,297 --> 04:41:33,085
are any of you guys
gonna be at Wonder Con?

7654
04:41:33,085 --> 04:41:34,654
TALIESIN: Saturday.
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe.

7655
04:41:34,654 --> 04:41:36,025
ORION: I'll be there Saturday.

7656
04:41:36,025 --> 04:41:37,120
MATT: I'm sadly not gonna be there.

7657
04:41:37,120 --> 04:41:40,870
ZAC: I will be there tomorrow
from 12:30 to one,

7658
04:41:42,990 --> 04:41:44,494
for a meet and greet,

7659
04:41:44,494 --> 04:41:47,191
which I'm going to pretend
is an autograph signing,

7660
04:41:47,191 --> 04:41:48,646
and I'm going to bring my own pictures.

7661
04:41:48,646 --> 04:41:50,675
MATT: Yeah!

7662
04:41:50,675 --> 04:41:51,811
ZAC: We're gonna have fun with it.

7663
04:41:51,811 --> 04:41:53,183
Going in costume.

7664
04:41:53,183 --> 04:41:55,173
Becca and I are going in costume,

7665
04:41:55,173 --> 04:41:57,774
and then Hector and Ify will be at four.

7666
04:41:57,774 --> 04:42:01,816
And then Hector and Ify are doing a Q and A,

7667
04:42:01,816 --> 04:42:05,886
or no, a trivia game
that night on the stage

7668
04:42:05,886 --> 04:42:07,401
for Geek &amp; Sundry and stuff like that.

7669
04:42:07,401 --> 04:42:08,708
So Geek &amp; Sundry will be there,

7670
04:42:08,708 --> 04:42:10,295
you guys should stop by.

7671
04:42:10,295 --> 04:42:13,659
LIAM: Thanks for all those
greater than three's, guys.

7672
04:42:13,659 --> 04:42:15,047
MATT: Less than three's.

7673
04:42:15,047 --> 04:42:17,348
TALIESIN: Greater than three, too.

7674
04:42:17,348 --> 04:42:18,722
ZAC: The computer, the story behind that,

7675
04:42:18,722 --> 04:42:20,457
is during the charity drive,

7676
04:42:20,457 --> 04:42:23,713
we had a robot read off
all the donation messages.

7677
04:42:23,713 --> 04:42:25,742
And the robot would say,
and when they made a heart,

7678
04:42:25,742 --> 04:42:27,804
it would say, "we less than three."

7679
04:42:27,804 --> 04:42:28,671
MATT: So beautiful.

7680
04:42:28,671 --> 04:42:29,847
ZAC: So we turned that into a thing.

7681
04:42:29,847 --> 04:42:31,663
LIAM: (robot voice) We less than three you.

7682
04:42:32,913 --> 04:42:36,305
MATT: It fucks me up every time you do that.

7683
04:42:36,305 --> 04:42:37,209
ZAC: Cool.

7684
