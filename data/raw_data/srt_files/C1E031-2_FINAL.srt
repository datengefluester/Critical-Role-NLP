1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,972
MARISHA: And I cast my Skywrite spell--
ew, I just
spit-- and I use the smoke in
the distance and as

2
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:16,259
it's rising up into the sky, start
drawing out the
de Rolo family crest in
the smoke.

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,595
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the plume
of smoke
and filter into the dark rain
clouds and you make

4
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:28,266
the smoke go to a thicker, thicker black
and take
the next few moments to begin
sculpting in the air

5
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:32,700
until eventually we have a very
well-defined de
Rolo crest now staring
down at the entire city of

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,958
Whitestone.

7
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:37,243
SAM: Oh! Something's happening!
Something's
happening in the sky!

8
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,650
MARISHA: That's me.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,202
SAM: I think it's a magic wielder of
some sort.
Something-- I must flee!

10
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:45,302
(laughter)

11
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:53,189
MATT: All right. Investigation checks
from both of
you.

12
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:55,021
LAURA: Okay.

13
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,299
TRAVIS: Did I find anything on
Smash-Face?

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,479
LIAM: (sighs) That's what you rolled the
last
time.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
LAURA: I know!

16
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:01,669
TALIESIN: 16.

17
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,729
LAURA: I've got to put this one away for
a while.

18
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,279
MATT: What did you roll?

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,630
LAURA: I rolled a nine.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,043
MATT: Okay. The two of you take a while
upstairs
looking about the rooms. You
manage to acquire

21
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:20,827
from just some of the local bits of
cabinets and
dust, you gather about 230
gold pieces.

22
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,242
LAURA: 230?

23
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:27,141
MATT: Just loose gold pieces that are
around.
There is a nice jewelry box that
seems to contain

24
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:31,264
most of the jewels and gems that this
individual
likes.

25
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:34,324
LAURA: I'm going to take the whole
jewelry box and
sort through it later.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,489
MATT: Okay. So say a box of Tylieri's
jewelry
would be what you've marked
down.

27
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,299
TALIESIN: Tylieri family jewels.

28
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,063
(laughter)

29
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:43,803
TALIESIN: That won't be confusing at
all.

30
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:47,681
MATT: There you go. You do notice,
however, that's
all you're able to find
for the most part, other than

31
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:51,094
some few bits of clothing and outfit.
The master
bedroom has no bed.

32
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,427
LAURA: Does he sleep in a coffin?

33
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:58,125
TALIESIN: We're going to finish
searching
downstairs and then find the
entrance to the--

34
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,425
MATT: Okay.

35
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:02,662
LIAM: I'd like to wind my way up there,
as well.

36
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:05,642
MATT: Okay, as you make your way up
there you
notice them stepping out.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,266
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still curious. I want to
go have a
look as well.

38
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,936
MATT: Go for it. Investigation.

39
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,427
LAURA: That's better, thank you.

40
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,257
LIAM: 16.

41
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:17,729
MATT: 16? You look through the room.
Most
everything of interest has already
been picked

42
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:24,536
clean. This room also doesn't seem to
see much use
other than the clothing
that's in there. This room

43
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:28,476
is used for dressing and presentational
purposes
but other than that, as a
bedroom, it's pretty

44
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:34,907
useless. As you guys go downstairs,
we'll say for
the sake of brevity you
take a little bit of time

45
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:39,007
to start looking through. You know
you're a little
pressed for time because
you can feel the energy

46
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,499
in the town begin to rise and you start
hearing
noises. You keeping an eye out?

47
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,226
MARISHA: Yeah.

48
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:46,078
MATT: The people that rush into the
rooms are now
rushing back out, some of
them wearing leather

49
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:49,267
tunics and small bits of armor, their
weapons
gathered, and they're forming
small bands.

50
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:54,758
MARISHA: I come over the speakers once
again, the
ear pieces. "I think it's
time to go. Whenever you

51
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,957
"guys are ready, I want to light this
bitch up."

52
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,657
TRAVIS: We need to check all the rooms
that go
downstairs first.

53
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:00,700
MARISHA: All right, quick.

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,706
TRAVIS: "Got an empty house." I run out
to the
door to the left. To the
uncovered areas.

55
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:10,660
MATT: Okay. You go over to this hallway.
You
eventually smash the door, doesn't
take too long.

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:19,607
It leads into what looks like a small
study or
some sort of an office room. A
big blue rug, a

57
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,268
desk with a chair, some papers strewn
about.

58
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,722
TRAVIS: Can I grab the rug and yank it?

59
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:27,189
MATT: Yeah, pull the rug off, reveals a
hatch.

60
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,371
TRAVIS: (excited shouting) I found a
hatch!

61
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,490
LAURA: (cries out in pain) No need to
yell!

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,578
TRAVIS: Oh sorry. (quieter) I found a
hatch.

63
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:38,640
TALIESIN: Quick, I just want to do a
quick round
of the downstairs room
before going to the hatch.

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,440
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you find
what looks to
be a general sitting area,
a music room, or a

65
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,719
place where you would host guests. Also
in fair disuse.
And then beyond that,
you find a room that's

66
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,444
pretty bland, with a staircase that
leads down
into what was once servants'
quarters that has

67
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,159
been converted into a torture room.

68
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,599
LAURA: Oh, lovely.

69
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,318
MATT: It's a little nicer in its
presentation and
tools than the duergar
torture room that you

70
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:10,298
encountered in the Underdark, but this
looks to be
like Tylieri had a definite
interest in

71
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:14,920
entertaining unwanted guests.

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,635
TALIESIN: Okay.

73
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:20,449
TRAVIS: Vax or Vex, will you come check
this hatch
for boobies?

74
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,388
(laughter)

75
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,186
LIAM: I jog on down.

76
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,499
MATT: All right, make a perception
check.

77
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,029
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 23.

78
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,129
MATT: Yeah, it does not appear to be
trapped.

79
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,399
TRAVIS: No boobies.

80
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,267
LIAM: Okay. You want to open that, big
guy?

81
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,677
TRAVIS: Yeah! (growls)

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:44,873
MATT: (vroom) The hatch comes up. There
is no
ladder; it's just a ten-foot drop
down into a

83
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:45,973
basement.

84
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:47,192
TRAVIS: Okay, I jump.

85
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:52,700
MATT: Land down there. A 20 foot by 20
foot room.
It's very musty. However, you
do see in the far

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,668
corner there is a pad of fresh earth set
up, and
there is a dark box.

87
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:59,364
TRAVIS: Um.

88
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,603
MATT: About eight feet long.

89
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:04,383
LIAM: I hear him say "Um," and I jump
down, too.
With the Flametongue dagger
out for light.

90
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,430
MATT: Okay. The room lights up a little
bit and
you can see across the way there
is a not

91
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,205
super-detailed, but a fairly
well-crafted coffin
on the opposite side
of the room.

92
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:16,146
TRAVIS: Ooh! I bet there's treasure in
there!

93
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:19,223
LIAM: You might be right. Yeah, let's go
have a
look.

94
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:21,243
LAURA: Is there treasure? Did you find
treasure?

95
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:27,357
LIAM: "Hold, please." Perception check
the coffin.
That's a 20.

96
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:32,199
MATT: Okay. The coffin does not appear
to be
trapped?

97
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,136
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

98
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,956
MARISHA: He said that with a question
mark.

99
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:37,595
MATT: It's always fun to do that.

100
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:41,609
TRAVIS: Well, should I just smash it?

101
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,934
LIAM: I really feel like this could be--

102
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,211
LAURA: Smash it!

103
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:50,499
TRAVIS: Three, two. Grog smashes.

104
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,858
LIAM: I kick it off with the end of my
foot.
Little bit. Or try to.

105
00:05:53,958 --> 00:06:00,066
MATT: Okay. (boof) The lid flies off and
then
slams on the ground. A smell hits
you that's just

106
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:08,628
like musty old mildewed earth. The
inside of the
coffin is, it's lined with
like a fine purplish

107
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:13,698
velvet material, the smell quickly
fades. It looks
like there are some
small baubles in there,

108
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:22,198
keepsakes. There is what looks to be a
cape or a
cloak that is laid across the
bottom of this for

109
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,898
comfort.

110
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:28,721
LIAM: Roll it up. Put it into my
satchel. I'm
going to take a dagger out
and I want to cut all

111
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,378
the way up through that purple velvet.
Just see,
just in case.

112
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,790
MATT: Okay. You cut through the purple
velvet.
Rummage through underneath. It
appears to be the

113
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,119
back of the box.

114
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:42,139
TALIESIN: I'm going to check his desk
upstairs for
anything interesting.

115
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:45,289
MATT: Okay. Want to make an
investigation check?

116
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,908
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

117
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:56,069
MATT: As you're rummaging through the
notes in the
desk, a lot of them are
ledgers involving the

118
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,089
trade in and out of the city. He has his
hands
dabbling in elements of the timber
trade, elements

119
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:08,085
of the actual trade of whitestone. He
talks about
the-- and you understand,
the reason that

120
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:13,685
Whitestone itself is-- the stone that's
mined here
is so popular for
construction and architecture

121
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:22,245
and other elements is the stone that
these
mountains are made of, when
properly prepared,

122
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:28,801
there is a faint bit of residuum that is
naturally
ingrained in the rock here. No
one really knows

123
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:33,922
how it came about, but whatever it is,
while it is
not inherently magical, it
makes it a little bit

124
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:38,826
easier, faster, and cheaper to enchant
the stone.
So when it comes to, you
know, enchanting a

125
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:46,142
teleportation circle permanently
somewhere or for
traps or things-- not
actual objects but actually

126
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:52,031
enchanting anything made of stonework.
It's easier
to enchant, and that's why
the whitestone of this

127
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:58,132
area is sought after and a good trade
element. So
there's notes about that.
But the stone trade has

128
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:03,221
been halted, all stone has continued to
be mined,
but it's not being
transported.

129
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:05,996
TRAVIS: Is the desk made out of the
stone?

130
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:12,401
MATT: No, there's just notes about it.
So all the
whitestone that is being
mined is not being

131
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,681
exported. It's being kept here,
somewhere.

132
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,221
LAURA: They're making something big.

133
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:17,497
TALIESIN: They're making something big.

134
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,512
LIAM: I think we need to get out of
here.

135
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,932
TRAVIS: I was going to ask, are you good
with the
coffin?

136
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,219
LIAM: Yeah.

137
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,821
TRAVIS: Okay. I smash the shit out of
it, in an
effort to see what's
underneath.

138
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:33,696
MATT: Okay. You take about 30 seconds of
extreme
violence against the wooden
coffin, killing it

139
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:39,297
into chunks and blocks. You get the
feeling that
this may have been the
place the mist was

140
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:50,088
trying to get to. But it did not make
its journey.
It got scattered by druid
Sunbeam and destroyed,

141
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:56,402
and the coffin is left in ruins. You
do-- even you,
Grog-- absorb the fact
that when a vampire goes to

142
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:01,227
mist form, you get the feeling that this
is the
home it needs to come to, to try
and survive.

143
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,073
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

144
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,852
MATT: Not anymore. Not that one.

145
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:07,725
MARISHA: Do I see anyone coming?

146
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:13,321
MATT: Oh. You see another zombie giant
coming up
the way. You can see people
attacking it, it's

147
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:17,461
just thrashing them about, but this one
seems less
bothered by the group and is
now moving towards a

148
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,915
specific area, moving towards the fiery
plume
in the distance. They're all
gathering in that

149
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,015
direction.

150
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:25,326
MARISHA: But no one seems to be rushing
towards
this house?

151
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,600
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

152
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:26,997
TRAVIS: This one's not on fire. Yet.

153
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:34,195
MATT: All right, you all gather, you can
hear the
rainstorm itself is coming down
in sheets. What

154
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,417
do you want to do?

155
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:36,811
TRAVIS: Light this candle!

156
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,549
LAURA: Should we light this on fire,
too?

157
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,174
TALIESIN: Burn it to the ground.

158
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:44,344
MARISHA: "Everyone out." And I start
casting a
Flaming Sphere.

159
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,585
MATT: Okay.

160
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,826
TRAVIS: We're out by now.

161
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:47,952
MARISHA: Everyone out.

162
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:51,732
MATT: You guys all step out into the
rain
(whooshes) pouring down. What bits
of guard blood

163
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,915
that have been pressed against you
washes off.

164
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,124
TRAVIS: Aw.

165
00:09:55,224 --> 00:10:01,734
MARISHA: I peek in this foyer. And just
(boof),
right in the middle, and take a
minute to

166
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,688
move it all around.

167
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:07,748
MATT: A Flaming Sphere begins to
corkscrew around
this room, up over the
banister, up to the upper

168
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:13,177
area, and like an artist, you paint this
entire
room with flame until the entire
interior of this

169
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:18,614
main foyer is just an inferno. You can
hear the
flames licking and the light is
very bright. You

170
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:24,122
end up backing up and you can see
people,
unarmored folk in nearby homes
that are pressed up

171
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:28,801
against their windows watching this
happen and
whispering to each other. The
children, those that

172
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:33,015
are kept guarded and are not part of
this
rebellion, they are watching this
with smiles.

173
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:38,066
MARISHA: Okay, I think that's good
enough.
Let's go.

174
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,059
TALIESIN: Head back to the curiosity
shop.

175
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,154
LAURA: Yeah, sneaky, stealthing.

176
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:44,597
MATT: Okay. As you guys run off into the
alley
behind--

177
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:46,617
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace I cast on
all of us.

178
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:50,615
MATT: Okay. How many more spells do you
have at
that level? Because you used it
several times

179
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:51,715
today.

180
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:55,404
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine with Pass Without
a Trace.
That's a 1st-level. 2nd-level,
but I'm fine.

181
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,736
TALIESIN: Back to the alcove, then?

182
00:10:56,786 --> 00:11:01,985
MATT: You guys all dart off into the
alley under
the cover of the shadows of
the storm and the

183
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:05,325
rainfall, to head towards the alcove,
and we'll go
ahead and take a quick
break.

184
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:06,485
(cheering)

185
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,065
MATT: A quick break, I know I always say
that, I'm
not going to say five minutes,
but.

186
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:10,432
SAM: This one's a real quick break.

187
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:14,308
MATT: We'll take it real quick because
we want to
try and get through as much
of the story before we

188
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:13,243
get to Critmas.

189
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:14,343
LAURA: Critmas!

190
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,265
LIAM: Critmas! Crimmas.

191
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,295
TALIESIN: Oh dear god.

192
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,616
TRAVIS: It's going to be a thing.

193
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,046
MATT: Which is going to, which is going
to take
some time tonight. Be back here
in a few minutes

194
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,503
guys, we'll see you in a sec.

195
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,325
TRAVIS: Pizza!

196
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,496
[break]

197
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:36,682
MATT: Welcome back. So. Jumping back
into the
chaos, the party has scattered
back into the

198
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:42,141
rainstorm. I would like everyone to make
a stealth
check.

199
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,881
LAURA: Oh, right. Plus ten for
everybody.

200
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:45,290
MATT: Plus ten.

201
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,607
LIAM: I did all right.

202
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:52,497
TALIESIN: I rolled my disadvantage.

203
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:54,769
TRAVIS: Does it matter on a one?

204
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,130
MATT: All right.

205
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,504
TRAVIS: Ten?

206
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:00,900
MATT: Total ten?

207
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,896
TRAVIS: Total ten. 11.

208
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,546
LAURA: 11, technically.

209
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,791
MATT: Okay.

210
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,070
LAURA: 29.

211
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,328
LIAM: 43.

212
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:10,492
SAM: I'm not there.

213
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:12,202
TRAVIS: 43?

214
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:17,951
MATT: Well, you're making your own
stealth,
though. You're invisible, so
just roll twice.

215
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,221
SAM: Natural 20.

216
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:20,722
MARISHA: 28.

217
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:22,052
TALIESIN: 30.

218
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:28,693
MATT: Okay. So making up for the
bounding chaos
that is Grog throughout
the city, you manage to

219
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:34,878
still make your way largely as a group
stealthed
to-- are you heading to the
alcove, you said?

220
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,570
TALIESIN: That's where we had our little
crash-base set up, right?

221
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:46,851
MATT: Correct. All right. You make your
way to the
alcove. As you're darting
through, you can see in

222
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:54,422
the distance small pocketed sounds of
yells and
the occasional sound of some
sort of large-scale

223
00:26:54,522 --> 00:27:00,443
crumbling or crashing of wood and
stone.
Occasionally, darting past the
streets, you see

224
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:10,822
militant occupants of Whitestone:
armored, rushing
through, shouting
orders to each other, some

225
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:16,963
coming back wounded and helping their
friends
back. The midday rebellion has
definitely started,

226
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:22,533
and you get the sense that the initial
surprise
has been effective, but the
longer this runs, the

227
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:28,508
longer this wears on, the more and more
of a body
count this will be.

228
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:33,716
TRAVIS: Seeing the chaos, can I get the
Dust of
Tracelessness and start trying
to sprinkle it

229
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:34,816
behind us?

230
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:35,893
MATT: Yeah.

231
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:37,619
MARISHA: Guys, we should do something.

232
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,999
LAURA: I know, we really should.

233
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:40,653
SAM: Am I with these guys yet?

234
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:47,056
MATT: You have not, but you all meet up
back at
the alcove, communicating over
your earpieces. You

235
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:50,897
make your way to the front of the
building. The
doors are closed and
locked.

236
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:53,592
LIAM: The alcove?

237
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:55,772
TRAVIS: Closed and locked?

238
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:59,261
LIAM: I'll see about that. I'm going to
check the
door.

239
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,834
MATT: Go for it.

240
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:05,154
LIAM: That is ten. 23.

241
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:07,874
MATT: Okay. Seems to be a fairly simple
lock.

242
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:08,979
LIAM: All right.

243
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,279
TRAVIS: Look for an ambush around. Can
we look
around?

244
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,238
LAURA: Yeah, perceive it?

245
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:13,938
TRAVIS: Rooftops? Sides of the building?

246
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:15,503
MATT: Make a perception check, guys.

247
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:16,754
MARISHA: All of us?

248
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,254
SAM: Me too?

249
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,608
MATT: Not you, you haven't gotten there
yet.

250
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,377
LIAM: 20.

251
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:24,803
TRAVIS: I actually rolled a 17.

252
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,903
MARISHA: 12.

253
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:26,923
TALIESIN: 24.

254
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:27,924
LAURA: 26.

255
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:34,753
MATT: Okay. Looking about, there doesn't
appear to
be any set ambush or anybody
else here. You do

256
00:28:34,853 --> 00:28:39,355
hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps
in the
interior.

257
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:43,556
LAURA: Should we knock on the door?

258
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:44,964
TRAVIS: Canvass the building.

259
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:51,179
LIAM: I can get in there and see who
that is. I
can go in, yeah.

260
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,685
LAURA: They're right on the inside.

261
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:57,065
LIAM: I thought it was upstairs, or you
said right
on the other side of the
door?

262
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:58,597
LAURA: Right on the other side of the
door.

263
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:05,194
MARISHA: Oh, for crying out loud. I push
past
them I just go, Jordana! Jordana,
it's us!

264
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:10,024
MATT: Okay, there's a pause and a voice
goes,
"Who's us?"

265
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,590
LAURA: Oh. Crazy grandma!

266
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,674
MARISHA: And Vox Machina. (quietly) Does
she know
we're called that?

267
00:29:16,774 --> 00:29:20,437
LAURA: No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy
grandma
was staying with you. Crazy
peasants.

268
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:21,838
MARISHA: Allies.

269
00:29:21,938 --> 00:29:23,565
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

270
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:28,129
MARISHA: Son of a-- nine?

271
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,782
LAURA: Can I help?

272
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:31,936
LAURA AND MARISHA: Crazy grandma!

273
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,724
MARISHA: Crazy grandma can help!

274
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,504
MATT: I'll say since you're backing her
failure
up, go ahead and make it with
disadvantage.

275
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:41,731
MARISHA: Hey, you don't have to call
it-- that
sounds so sad when you say it
like that.

276
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,831
LAURA: 18.

277
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:54,384
MATT: 18. There's a pause. "Crazy
grandma? Come
in." You hear the sound of
a locking sound and the

278
00:29:54,484 --> 00:30:00,432
door opens up ever-so-slightly. A very,
very dimly
lit interior, there's a small
lantern, a hooded

279
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,572
lantern across the room. Other than
that, you see
the shadow of Jordana as
she ushers you all in out

280
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,015
of the rain.

281
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:08,735
LAURA: So, hey guess what? It's started.

282
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:15,161
MATT: "Yeah, apparently." She closes the
door
behind you, looks out the window
that has the

283
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:22,925
curtains closed and goes, "Okay. So.
It's
underway. It's not safe to be here
right now."

284
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:24,055
LAURA: No.

285
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,114
MATT: "Did anyone see you come in?"

286
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:27,619
LAURA: No, no.

287
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:32,822
MATT: "Good. Who are you?"

288
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:39,966
LAURA: "Oh. Well." How about Seeming?
This whole
time, have we looked like

289
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,442
crazy peasants during the battle?

290
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,542
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

291
00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:43,438
TRAVIS: We dropped it.

292
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
LAURA: We dropped it?

293
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,992
MATT: You dropped Seeming before all of
this.

294
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,190
LAURA: Okay, just making sure Trinket
wasn't a
donkey that killed the--

295
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,708
MATT: No.

296
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:50,498
TALIESIN: That would've been intense and
awesome.

297
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:53,027
MATT: That would've been amazing. Donkey
eating a
vampire head? Aw, man.

298
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:57,774
LIAM: This is hard to believe, but this
is crazy
grandma.

299
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:02,536
LAURA: "I'm crazy grandma." I do a crazy
eye thing
just to show her.

300
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:05,570
SAM: Am I there, Matt?

301
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,536
MATT: You've just now gotten to that
point, you
see the door closing as you
get there.

302
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:13,845
SAM: Hello. Hi. How'd it go?

303
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:18,840
MARISHA: Good work, by the way! That was
awesome!
I mean, I saw the fire, I don't
know what you did.

304
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,956
LAURA: So it went well?

305
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:27,295
SAM: I set fire to the place, some shit
went down,
dinosaurs were harmed, but I
know you got the

306
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:29,573
smoke signal and used that to attack.

307
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,477
MARISHA: The de Rolos have dinosaurs?

308
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:35,790
SAM: No, it was me. It's all good,
though. I
caused a ruckus, that's all I
was supposed to do.

309
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,978
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah.

310
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,428
MATT: "What is going on?"

311
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:39,528
TRAVIS: Right.

312
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:43,533
TALIESIN: We may have just started a
revolution.

313
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:46,228
MARISHA: Does he look familiar to you?

314
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:51,899
LIAM: You don't recognize us, it's not
safe to
walk these streets for
outsiders, so we were using

315
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:58,729
a little bit of trickery. This is us.
We're the
same people you were dealing
with before.

316
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,310
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

317
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,038
LAURA: We just need to rest.

318
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:07,509
MATT: "Okay. You can rest here, but how
long?"

319
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,560
LAURA: Until we're healed, and then
we'll go.

320
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,962
LIAM: Overnight.

321
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,098
MATT: "All right."

322
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:16,200
LAURA: I feel like we should get word
out to
somebody, though, because--

323
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,599
SAM: To what? To hold the revolution?

324
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,819
LAURA: I feel like everybody's going to
die before
we even get to the castle!

325
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:24,398
MARISHA: That's the thing. I don't know
if this is
the time to rest.

326
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:26,409
LAURA: But we don't have any spells.

327
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:31,577
MARISHA: I'm okay. We can maybe make do.

328
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,744
LAURA: I can't make do.

329
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:37,969
TRAVIS: You might be cool, but we're
fucked.

330
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:43,868
TALIESIN: How about we stay here until
4:00, 5:00
in the morning--

331
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:45,390
MARISHA: What time is it now?

332
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,449
MATT: Right now, I'd say you're close to
three in
the afternoon.

333
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,419
LAURA: How do we tell the people to like
hold
off?

334
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,279
SAM: We need to briefly quell the
rebellion?

335
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:58,791
MARISHA: We started something. We can't
stop it
now.

336
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:05,232
TALIESIN: We're going to be indoors. It
doesn't
matter what time we go to attack
the castle.

337
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:10,202
SAM: Let's spread word. We can spread
word. Let's
find a few--

338
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,957
LAURA: Can we send off a message?

339
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:23,582
MARISHA: We sparked a hope in people. We
now have
innocent peasants, people who
are not fighters--

340
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:28,499
SAM: Can you Skywrite something like
"attack
tomorrow" or "hold"?

341
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,239
LAURA: What if we all take off in
separate
directions and we tell all the
peasants we find

342
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:35,225
that are fighting the time that we're
going to
attack?

343
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:39,472
TRAVIS: Aren't there a bunch of zombie
stone
giants walking around?

344
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:43,750
LAURA: Well yeah, we'll have to be
sneaky about
it, but we'll spread the
rumors around. I look at

345
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,854
Jordana. Joanna?

346
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:47,022
MATT: Jordana.

347
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:53,578
LAURA: Jordana. And I say, can you get
word out
to people?

348
00:33:53,678 --> 00:34:01,593
MATT: "To a few, maybe. I don't want to
go outside
right now."

349
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,421
LAURA: I don't blame you, dear.

350
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:09,075
TALIESIN: Let's let her stay. I say we
just rest
up and we attack tonight.

351
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:11,662
TRAVIS: Tonight?

352
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,424
MARISHA: What if there isn't a town to
defend
tonight?

353
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:17,893
TRAVIS: Aren't they stronger then?

354
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:21,367
TALIESIN: It's going to be indoors,
anyway.

355
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:25,993
SAM: First of all, it's raining outside.
It's
daytime. There's no vampires out
there right now,

356
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:27,855
right? They don't like water, do they?

357
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,955
LAURA: No, they don't like running
water, in fact
they hate running water!

358
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,427
I didn't think about that.

359
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:35,847
MARISHA: It's a lot of running water,
though. I
think they're all right with
rain.

360
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:37,923
TRAVIS: Yeah, they said a river is what
the...
right?

361
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:45,677
SAM: I'm sure they don't like it. In any
case, the only
thing that our rebels are
rebelling against right

362
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:51,544
now are six zombie giants, one of whom
I'm pretty
sure they killed already. Did
I see them?

363
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:55,787
MATT: Best you could see, that group was
doing
pretty well and was hacking it
down. Lost a few of

364
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,143
their number in the process.

365
00:34:57,243 --> 00:35:00,083
MARISHA: Did we ever get a count of how
many
zombie giants there were?

366
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:00,322
SAM: There were six.

367
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:03,335
MATT: There were six that you saw while
you were
doing your overall flight.

368
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:05,337
LAURA: What, so we go out and fight
zombie
giants?

369
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:07,325
SAM: No, but maybe we could--

370
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:14,090
MARISHA: Why not? We are the most
capable people
in this town right now.

371
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,153
LAURA: Well. We could go fight zombie
giants and
then tell everybody to wait.

372
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:23,104
TRAVIS: Nah, it's going to fuck us.
We've got to
rest.

373
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:30,496
MARISHA: Why don't we take a short rest,
heal up a
bit, get back out there, take
down some giants.

374
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,526
What do you guys say?

375
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:36,701
SAM: I admire this fire in your eyes,
but it's so
stupid.

376
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,481
LAURA: What if we run out and tell
people to stop
fucking fighting and wait
until tomorrow?

377
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:44,686
LIAM: They won't. The giants are going
to keep
smashing them.

378
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:46,839
SAM: What time did he say it was?

379
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:51,366
TALIESIN: It's about three. We could
just do a
round of the front courtyard
and see what's going on.

380
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:53,400
LAURA: Fuck! Fine.

381
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,665
TALIESIN: Try and sleep through the
night.

382
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:58,485
LAURA: All right. We fight until we
absolutely
can't fight anymore.

383
00:35:58,193 --> 00:36:01,704
TRAVIS: What about the people who
absolutely need a
short rest at the
minimum stay.

384
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:02,936
LIAM: We stay for an hour.

385
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,748
TALIESIN: We're short-resting right now.

386
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:06,075
LIAM: Rest for an hour.

387
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:10,055
MARISHA: This is going to go on for a
while, but
the longer we wait indoors,
the more people are

388
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:17,931
going to die, and if we're killing
people to try
and save the masses--
which is how I'm justifying

389
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:23,226
this whole thing, by the way-- I feel
like we
can't leave the masses to their
own devices.

390
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:28,736
SAM: Wait a second, what about that,
what about
that cleric, the religious
man that you've talked

391
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:32,373
to. Could he get a message out to
everybody?
What's his name?

392
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:34,113
LAURA: At this point, though, it's
chaos.

393
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,066
TRAVIS: Yeah.

394
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:39,013
MARISHA: We literally lit the fire and
we can't
stop it now.

395
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,450
SAM: Archibald? Is that his name?

396
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,510
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're standing up for
themselves.

397
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:47,025
TALIESIN: We also, somebody-- there's
the point
that somebody is informing on
us.

398
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,966
MARISHA: Someone <i>is</i> informing on us.

399
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,546
SAM: What are you talking about, why?

400
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:52,897
TALIESIN: They were ready for us. They
knew we
were coming.

401
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:54,646
SAM: Of course they knew we were coming,
we killed
one of their--

402
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:57,457
LAURA: They said there was an informant.
They said
that there was an informant
when we were there.

403
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:57,875
TRAVIS: Who did?

404
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:03,062
LAURA: That guard. He said our contacts
were
right. Our informant was correct.
Somebody is

405
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:05,881
informing on us. It could be you.

406
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,626
LIAM: I insight-check this woman.

407
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,762
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

408
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,662
LIAM: 14.

409
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:16,918
LAURA: Can I say it? Because I just
said, "It
could be you." Can I do the
same thing?

410
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:18,877
MATT: Sure, go ahead.

411
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:24,256
LAURA: All right. That's terrible. Okay.
So.

412
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:25,700
SAM: What do you want to know?

413
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,335
MATT: Best that you can tell, she just
looks
genuinely scared and is
uncomfortable with your

414
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:34,539
presence right now but is letting it
happen. She's
still getting over the
fact that you guys look

415
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,819
entirely different than when you first
talked to
her about staying here.

416
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:41,208
LAURA: Well, short rest and then we head
out? We
do some attacks and--

417
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:43,737
LIAM: I've never fought a zombie giant
before.

418
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:46,769
LAURA: No, but everybody else is doing
it. Those
peasants are doing it.

419
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:50,789
LIAM: That's what I'm saying. Let's see
what we're
up against. Let's take a
breather and let's go

420
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,033
pick one off.

421
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:58,437
MARISHA: Jordana, do you have any books
here on
zombie giants?

422
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:09,038
MATT: "For the most part, necromancy is
not
studied in this town. At least, we
never had to

423
00:38:09,138 --> 00:38:15,397
"deal with it until recently, and we
haven't had
the opportunity to really
study since."

424
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:22,024
MARISHA: Well, I mean, zombie combined
with
giants. We've fought zombies and
we've fought

425
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:25,889
giants, so I'm assuming it with a
vague--

426
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:28,030
TRAVIS: What?

427
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,472
LAURA: We keep our distance.

428
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:32,078
TALIESIN: How long does it take to
recharge Hex,
by the way?

429
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:34,198
MATT: You need a long rest.

430
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:37,516
TRAVIS: How many Sunbeam hadoukens do
you have
left, Keyleth?

431
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:42,059
MARISHA: How many hadoukens? As in
Sunbeams? I'm
done on Sunbeams.

432
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,894
SAM: We need to rest.

433
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:46,114
TRAVIS: If we get a short rest, how many
do you
get?

434
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,502
MARISHA: I'm done. None.

435
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:48,242
LAURA: We need a long rest to get
spells.

436
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,577
MARISHA: However, if I short rest, I
actually
haven't burnt any of my animal
forms here recently

437
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:59,210
and I can water elemental up, which
would also
permanently kill them. So I
have other defenses

438
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,422
that could still take down vampires if
we
encounter another one. I'm more
concerned about

439
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,131
these giants right now.

440
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:08,511
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about.
They're
vampires.

441
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,261
MARISHA: No, they're zombies. They're
undead.

442
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,361
LAURA: They're zombies.

443
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:12,343
LIAM: They're undead.

444
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:14,115
TRAVIS: Those are two different things,
huh?

445
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,550
MATT: They are two very different
things.

446
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:16,469
TRAVIS: Grog learns.

447
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:18,569
(laughter)

448
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:22,563
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

449
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,887
LAURA: We short rest and get back out.

450
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,615
LIAM: We take a short rest and then
exterminate.

451
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:32,386
SAM: Wait, join the rebellion or ride
around town
telling everyone, "quell?"

452
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:37,330
MARISHA: We're taking down these damn
giants.
These giants are killing people
left and right; we

453
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,808
watched them crush people on our way
here.

454
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,388
TALIESIN: We tell them that they take
cover during
the night.

455
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,242
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll four hit dice.

456
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:48,182
MATT: Yeah, you guys go ahead, use your
hit dice to
heal up while you're taking
your short rest

457
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,660
for those who've taken damage.

458
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,112
LAURA: Oh, Trinket. Can you heal
Trinket?

459
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:52,345
MARISHA: I can.

460
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:59,612
LAURA: Heal him so much. Does Trinket
get... oh,
he does get hit dice.

461
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:05,679
MATT: Trinket technically does not.
Trinket
requires--

462
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,021
LAURA: It says he does. It's written
down.

463
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,121
MATT: Hit dice?

464
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,081
LAURA: Yeah.

465
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:10,838
MATT: Okay.

466
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:17,832
TALIESIN: Also, another strange
question: what
creates initiative?
Initiative is your dexterity

467
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:18,932
modifier?

468
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
MATT: Correct.

469
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,361
TALIESIN: So with me, it's my dexterity
modifier.
Plus two.

470
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:23,314
MATT: Correct.

471
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:26,984
TALIESIN: I'm also currently wearing a
Headband of
Initiative, which I'd
forgotten about.

472
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:27,235
MATT: Which...?

473
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,100
TALIESIN: Gives me plus two to my
initiative.

474
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:30,075
MATT: Correct.

475
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,807
TALIESIN: Oh, dear god almighty. Okay.
Thank you.

476
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,691
MATT: Percy, Percy, Percy.

477
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,990
TALIESIN: I don't mean to be doing this.

478
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:42,477
MATT: No, it's great. Just glad you
didn't take the
Alertness feat. Then
things would have gotten

479
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:43,683
stupid.

480
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,392
LAURA: Are you healing Trinket?

481
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:46,932
MARISHA: How much more does he need?

482
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:51,571
LAURA: He's at 36. He needs 24 more.

483
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:56,363
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to be
using the Hat
of Disguise just because
it's probably safe. Does

484
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:58,788
anybody want a Headband of Initiative?

485
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:02,502
LAURA: Yeah. Do you not need it?

486
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,972
TALIESIN: I can't wear two things on my
head.

487
00:41:05,072 --> 00:41:07,036
LAURA: I don't have anything on my head.

488
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:10,652
TALIESIN: So you've got plus two to
your
initiative, and I'm losing plus two
to my

489
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:14,267
initiative. It's called a Headband of
Initiative.

490
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,567
MARISHA: You already have an eight to
your
initiative.

491
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,661
LIAM: It's very mystical.

492
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:22,575
TRAVIS: How much time do we have before
the sun
that is being blocked by the
rainclouds goes

493
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:23,675
down?

494
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:28,089
MATT: Well, you guys are taking a short
rest,
about 30 minutes to an hour, so
you have about two

495
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:30,349
and a half, three hours before it goes
down
entirely.

496
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,090
TALIESIN: That should give us enough
time to do a
quick tour. We already know
their walking route,

497
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,031
and I'm sure that the people are putting
up a
fight.

498
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,363
MARISHA: I'm going to give him a level
two Cure
Wounds.

499
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:39,172
LAURA: Okay.

500
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:40,657
MARISHA: So do 2d8 plus ten.

501
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:41,757
LAURA: Me?

502
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:44,934
MARISHA: Sure. Me or you. Whoever feels
more
comfortable.

503
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,432
LAURA: I'll do it. It was good.

504
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:52,684
MATT: During this rest, if you wanted to
spend some time with that cape--

505
00:41:52,784 --> 00:41:58,547
LIAM: I do. I'm going to sniff it and
shake it
out.

506
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:01,566
MATT: For the most part, it doesn't
appear to be
enchanted.

507
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:05,057
SAM: No, I can sing a Song of Rest for
all of us.

508
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:06,977
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh, yeah. Do that.

509
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:10,582
SAM: It gives us all 1d6. That's pretty
weak.

510
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:12,823
MARISHA: No, but that's...

511
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:15,763
LAURA: No, it's fine. He's got extra hit
points;
don't worry about it.

512
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:21,392
MARISHA: Well, Song of Rest just
happens, right?
Do you get that for
free? You might as well, if

513
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:22,866
you don't burn anything.

514
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:32,351
SAM: Okay. (sings) Health! We need some
now.
Health! Not just anybody. Health!
You know you

515
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:33,502
need someone.

516
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:35,189
ALL: (sings) Health!

517
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:47,472
MATT: That's not trademarked at all. I
love it.
All right, so you guys have
rested up. Through the

518
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:53,601
rest, you occasionally hear voices run
by,
yelling. As you guys get toward the
end of your

519
00:42:53,701 --> 00:43:03,749
rest, you hear the (stomping) large
heavy
footfalls heading nearby.
(groaning, crash) A

520
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,527
loud, heavy impact, and you hear some
short cheers
outside.

521
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:08,627
TRAVIS: Yes!

522
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,690
LAURA: Yay!

523
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,914
SAM: Oh, he died. That's two down.
Splash two.

524
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:17,264
TRAVIS: Right out front, we hear it?

525
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:21,467
MATT: Out front, a little ways off. Not
immediately.

526
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:23,847
SAM: Do we have horses? We don't have
any horses,
do we?

527
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:24,565
LAURA: No.

528
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:25,299
LIAM: They died.

529
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:26,922
MATT: Yeah, they got eaten by harpies.

530
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,262
TRAVIS: Should we go outside and see how
they're
doing?

531
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,416
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's check it out.

532
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:31,854
TRAVIS: We go out front.

533
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:33,762
LIAM: Time to kill some giant undead.

534
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,142
MATT: Okay. Jordana lets you guys out,
locks
behind her.

535
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:36,929
MARISHA: Do we want to split up?

536
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:38,203
TALIESIN: No, let's keep together.

537
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:41,612
LAURA: Actually, before we go, I ask, do
you have
any holy symbols at all in
here?

538
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,524
MATT: "I'm sorry, no."

539
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:43,673
LAURA: Nothing?

540
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:49,214
MATT: "No. All those were kept in either
of the
two temples here."

541
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:51,693
LAURA: Do you have anything magic that
could help
me?

542
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:54,353
MATT: "I already gave you everything of
magic that
I had here."

543
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:55,424
LAURA: Oh, right. I forgot we took it.

544
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:56,524
MATT: "Sorry."

545
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,176
LAURA: Shit. All right, thank you.

546
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:01,156
TRAVIS: Once we're outside, how far away
is that
giant that was felled?

547
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:04,949
MATT: As you step outside and look, it's
about 60
feet off, near one of the big
crossroads near this

548
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:09,837
area. And a zombie giant has been
completely
felled down, and there are
three people now that

549
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:13,937
are currently in the process of hacking
its head
off just to make sure. It's a
group of about seven

550
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:18,203
people that live here. They're all
looking pretty
messed up, but they're
all eager and

551
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,297
adrenaline-driven, they're all hacking
away, then
stopping and taking a breath
(breathes heavily).

552
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:28,696
You hear in the distance, (thunder
crack) bolt of
lightning coming down
from the storm, and as it

553
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:35,172
echoes, everyone shakes for a second,
look at each
other, (cheers) give a
cheer of victory. They all

554
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:40,675
hop off the body of the zombie giant and
begin
darting further in towards the
center of the city.

555
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:43,885
MARISHA: I look up. Is my de Rolo symbol
still in
the sky?

556
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:48,194
MATT: It's there. It's dissipating
slowly, but
it's still there. It's moved
a little bit off-axis

557
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,736
with the storm.

558
00:44:49,836 --> 00:44:54,284
TRAVIS: So that's it for the big houses,
right?
Just the castle.

559
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:55,424
TALIESIN: Just the castle.

560
00:44:55,494 --> 00:44:59,538
SAM: Except we haven't killed the
members of one
of the houses. By the
way, my Song of Rest is a d8.

561
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:00,675
LAURA: Awesome.

562
00:45:00,775 --> 00:45:05,797
SAM: But we haven't killed the last one.
Now, the
one that you guys killed.
What's his name again,

563
00:45:05,897 --> 00:45:06,897
Tylieri?

564
00:45:06,764 --> 00:45:07,764
MATT: Tylieri.

565
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:08,716
SAM: He was a vampire.

566
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:09,816
ALL: Yes.

567
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:15,855
SAM: Because Sylas killed him. Right?

568
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:17,027
TALIESIN: Yes.

569
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:19,365
SAM: And then made him a vampire.

570
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:20,545
TALIESIN: One would assume.

571
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:22,665
SAM: Didn't he hang him on the Sun Tree?

572
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:25,682
LAURA: What? No. What? What are you
talking
about?

573
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:28,237
SAM: I don't know. Didn't that guy that
we
meet...

574
00:45:28,337 --> 00:45:36,105
MATT: You do recall, actually, when you
were
interrogating the driver of the
Briarwoods.

575
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:46,217
Tylieri was the master of the driver
Desmond, who
beat him and subjugated him
to various forms of

576
00:45:46,317 --> 00:45:53,891
torture and abuse before Lord Briarwood
took
Desmond and, to try and show
extension of faith,

577
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:58,418
revealed to Desmond Tylieri hanging from
the Sun
Tree. That was true.

578
00:45:58,518 --> 00:45:59,962
TRAVIS: Wow.

579
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:04,319
SAM: And then he became a vampire. Is
that where
they're spawning?

580
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:10,367
LAURA: No. Maybe he was already a
vampire and he
hung him from the tree
just to show--

581
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,388
SAM: That doesn't seem right.

582
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:16,530
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Sun Tree,
why don't
we?

583
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,897
LAURA: Let's head that direction.

584
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,236
TRAVIS: Let's go.

585
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:25,346
MARISHA: Something to us about how when
people die
in this town. The guy you
talked to at the bar?

586
00:46:25,446 --> 00:46:29,291
SAM: Yes, we talked to a guy at the bar.
What
about him?

587
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:32,779
MARISHA: He said when people die here
they don't
die.

588
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,598
SAM: Well, yes, we know that, yes.

589
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:35,831
LAURA: They come back.

590
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:38,945
LIAM: They could be-- yes, that could
apply, too.

591
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:44,037
MARISHA: I think this whole damn town--
I think
the whole land is cursed. Is
what I think.

592
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,231
TRAVIS: I think that's--

593
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:46,637
LAURA: Probably pretty fair.

594
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,467
TRAVIS: Should we go to the tree?

595
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:49,567
LAURA: Sure.

596
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:50,972
MARISHA: Why?

597
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:53,701
TALIESIN: Just to see--

598
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:57,601
LAURA: We'll make our way through the
town and
look for giants as we make our
way to the tree.

599
00:46:56,798 --> 00:46:59,038
MARISHA: Let's look for giants. Let's go
giant-hunting.

600
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:04,339
MATT: Okay. All right, so from the
Alcove, you guys
head in a southwestern
motion, keeping off the

601
00:47:04,439 --> 00:47:11,661
main paths best you can. The main chaos
seems to
have died down a little bit in
this area of the

602
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:19,143
town. You come across another body of a
zombie
giant, surrounded by what looks
like eight bodies

603
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:21,302
of civilians of the town.

604
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:23,242
LAURA: Are they all dead, or are they
injured?

605
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:28,209
MATT: No, they are all very dead. Two of
which are
torn in half and just tossed
to different sides,

606
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:34,831
one appears to be half-eaten, and the
rest are
just smashed. But whatever
troop was with

607
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:38,731
them managed to take the zombie giant
down.
Eventually, you make your way to
the center of the

608
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:46,731
town square where the Sun Tree is and
there is,
across the way on the opposite
side, what appears

609
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:54,476
to be, in mid-struggle, one zombie giant
that has
a series of spears or javelins
sticking out of its

610
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:59,017
torso. It's currently swatting at a
group of
individuals that have torches
in the rain, still

611
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:04,199
trying to get up towards it and push it
backward.
The Sun Tree, at a glance--
roll a perception

612
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,499
check.

613
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,700
MARISHA: All of us?

614
00:48:06,556 --> 00:48:07,879
MATT: Yes.

615
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:12,430
TALIESIN: One. There's a tree!

616
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,779
SAM: Four.

617
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:15,269
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, so 29?

618
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:16,369
MATT: Okay.

619
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,400
LIAM: 23.

620
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,600
LAURA: If my passive perception's higher
than my
roll--

621
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:22,949
MATT: Active perception and passive
perception--
passive is more something
to keep track when

622
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:26,467
you're not actively perceiving. So.
Grog?

623
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:27,624
TRAVIS: Seven.

624
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:33,175
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you pick this out
in the
rain, and it's hard to see, but
from this angle,

625
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:41,831
you see what looks to be eight ropes,
currently,
just dangling free from the
Sun Tree.

626
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,340
TALIESIN: Damn it.

627
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,540
LAURA: Shit.

628
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,375
SAM: The tree is the spawning spot.

629
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:48,070
LAURA: Really?

630
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,280
SAM: Or maybe one of them.

631
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,350
TRAVIS: Or maybe they cut them down.

632
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,146
SAM: We've got to cut down this tree.

633
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:58,151
LAURA: Does it look like the ropes have
been cut?

634
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:00,291
MATT: You can go closer to inspect it if
you
want.

635
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:01,161
MARISHA: Yeah.

636
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,550
MATT: You're hearing in the distance the
(roars)
the battle's still raging about
65, 70 feet from

637
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,787
you. You get up behind the tree and you
take the
ropes and inspect it. All the
ropes are very

638
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:11,887
finely cut.

639
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:14,241
LAURA: Oh. They were cut. They cut them
down.

640
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:15,948
TRAVIS: They cut their dead down.

641
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:17,789
MARISHA: Okay, so the nooses are gone.

642
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:23,988
MATT: Yeah. And you do see, there are a
number.
This close, you can see there
are loops of rope

643
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:29,287
all over the tree: some very old and
weathered and
aged, some of them are
torn, some of them are cut,

644
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:34,941
but the fresh ones that are the longest
currently
and that are placed closest to
where the bodies

645
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,380
were originally there are all very
cleanly cut.

646
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,352
LAURA: Can we spin around and look and
see if
there's anything around that
looks like-- or look

647
00:49:41,452 --> 00:49:45,321
at tracking and see if it looks like
somebody cut
them down or if they fell
on their own?

648
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:52,405
MATT: You glance around real fast and
you can see
to the south there is still
the battle raging

649
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:56,185
between the zombie giant and the crew
of
individuals, but you look back where
you guys were

650
00:49:56,015 --> 00:50:01,763
from, and you see a large series of
shapes
stepping through the rain, coming
from the

651
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:03,231
direction you guys were.

652
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:07,091
LIAM: I think they cut them down just
like
Tylieri. I think that this is where
they hang them

653
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:11,082
to ripen, and then when they're ready
they pluck
them off the tree and set
them on their way.

654
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:16,143
MATT: As you're having this
conversation, you,
keeping your eyes
forward as he's saying this in

655
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:23,132
your ear, you can see, as the light of
the town is
slowly beginning to vanish
into a sunset--

656
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:24,534
MARISHA: Is it still raining?

657
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:31,802
MATT: It is still raining. You see ahead
of you,
coming from the central roadway
into the square of

658
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:40,535
the town, what you can only surmise to
be anywhere
from 30 to 50 armored
skeletal entities that are

659
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,733
pouring from the north.

660
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,594
MARISHA: Okay. I climb the Sun Tree.

661
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:46,534
SAM: Wait, what? We've got to get out of
here!

662
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:47,793
MARISHA: I'm climbing the Sun Tree.

663
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:51,076
MATT: Climbing the Sun Tree. All right.
You guys
see Keyleth scurry up the Sun
Tree.

664
00:50:51,153 --> 00:50:56,758
SAM: I blow my Horn of Fog to create
a
smokescreen. I don't know what the
fuck she's

665
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:57,858
doing.

666
00:50:57,923 --> 00:51:03,103
MATT: Okay. (foghorn sound) The slow
horn-blow
comes out, and this fog begins
to fill the area

667
00:51:03,203 --> 00:51:08,795
between this marching skeletal army and
the Sun
Tree where you guys currently
are. Looking over

668
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:13,274
your shoulder, you can see the zombie
giant
finishes smashing the last
individual in that

669
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:18,024
crew, picks it up and jams it into its
jagged
giant teeth.

670
00:51:18,124 --> 00:51:20,884
MARISHA: So there's a big army coming
down,
filtering down a street.

671
00:51:20,694 --> 00:51:22,054
MATT: Down the street towards you.

672
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,041
MARISHA: How far away?

673
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:25,392
MATT: You can't tell now. There's just
fog along
the way.

674
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,249
MARISHA: I can't tell how far away they
are right
now?

675
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:27,823
MATT: No, you can't see them.

676
00:51:27,764 --> 00:51:29,203
MARISHA: I can't see them?

677
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:33,538
MATT: No, because Scanlan just created a
whole
bunch of fog between the two of
you. The moment

678
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:37,705
you saw, they may be about a hundred or
so feet
from you.

679
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:41,645
LIAM: Keyleth, tell us what you're
thinking,
because the rest of us are
taking this time to go.

680
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,985
TRAVIS: You engage, they'll follow, we
go, we
fight another day, we sleep in
the rafters and

681
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:46,436
wait until daybreak.

682
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,053
LIAM: Who are you?

683
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:53,341
MARISHA: I might be able to do
something.

684
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:55,424
LAURA: What is it? Say it!

685
00:51:55,524 --> 00:52:01,912
MARISHA: I can do a big ice storm or do
something
to take all these fuckers out
at once.

686
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:04,664
TRAVIS: All 30 to 50 of them? Kill them
all?

687
00:52:04,764 --> 00:52:06,280
MARISHA: It's a big range.

688
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,595
LIAM: No. Keyleth, we've got to go.

689
00:52:08,695 --> 00:52:14,965
TALIESIN: I say we let her hit them, and
we run.

690
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:20,095
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you drop the fog
just a
bit?

691
00:52:20,195 --> 00:52:21,677
SAM: Nope, not by magic.

692
00:52:21,777 --> 00:52:22,925
MATT: He can't control it.

693
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:27,065
LAURA: It's on the ground. You can
probably see
above it. Fog is low.

694
00:52:27,165 --> 00:52:32,705
MATT: Well, the fog this creates is a
magical fog
that obscures an entire
area. If you climbed to

695
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:35,885
the very top of the tree, you might be
able to get
a little bit of a visual.

696
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:38,614
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to climb
as high as
I can.

697
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:40,475
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

698
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,135
LAURA: I'm going to climb up after her.

699
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:43,479
SAM: Oh my god.

700
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:49,897
MARISHA: 11. Acrobatics or athletics?

701
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:50,997
MATT: Athletics.

702
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:53,326
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 15.

703
00:52:53,426 --> 00:52:59,898
MATT: 15. Okay. You make your way up to
the very
precarious top of the branches.
You can feel the

704
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:04,515
brittleness of it as the tree itself,
its life
force is withered over time and
some of it cracks

705
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:10,720
and some of the actual bark of the tree
twists off
in your grip as you get to
the very top. You can look

706
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,843
just over the bank of fog that Scanlan
has created
and you can see beyond that.
The number of undead

707
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:20,883
from this angle, what was initially like
30
probably pushes closer to about a
hundred.

708
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:24,907
MARISHA: Okay. And they're like a
hundred feet
away?

709
00:53:25,007 --> 00:53:27,847
MATT: Starting about a hundred feet
away, slowly
marching towards you.

710
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:33,571
MARISHA: Right where they are, I'm going
to start
a little ahead of where they
originate, I'm going

711
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:39,828
to start making an ice storm. I'm
pushing all the
way back to where-- just
right down these

712
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:40,928
fuckers.

713
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:43,566
LIAM: I'm also just trying to stay
underneath her
as best I can.

714
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,514
LAURA: Stop looking up her skirt,
brother.

715
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:48,347
LIAM: Is she in a skirt?

716
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:50,688
SAM: She's been wearing a dress this
whole time?

717
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:52,468
LIAM: I thought she was covered in
leaves.

718
00:53:52,426 --> 00:53:55,064
TALIESIN: Stop looking up her fig leaf.

719
00:53:55,164 --> 00:54:00,497
MATT: All right. What's the damage on
that? Is it
2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8--

720
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:04,088
MARISHA: They take 2d8 bludgeoning
damage and 4d6
cold damage.

721
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:09,097
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for both.
And it's a
save for half, right?

722
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:10,589
TALIESIN: Inspiration?

723
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:12,958
SAM: Oh. Well. I didn't do it.

724
00:54:13,058 --> 00:54:28,358
MARISHA: 2d8 bludgeoning, that's
seven
bludgeoning... 4d6. Not great at
all. Four, five,

725
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,858
six, seven, eight.

726
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:34,136
MATT: Total of eight. Eight plus... what
was the
other one?

727
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:35,368
MARISHA: Seven.

728
00:54:35,468 --> 00:54:36,980
MATT: Seven, okay.

729
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,778
MARISHA: And it's difficult terrain.

730
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:46,314
MATT: Okay. So the first area. Suddenly
you see
some of the clouds above you
begin to funnel

731
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:52,741
downward, and a few bolts of electricity
(crackle)
through it. As the funnel
hits, it grows dark, and

732
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:58,838
then all of a sudden this cold wind
begins to
swirl around it. And with
that, the cloud almost

733
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:04,740
seems to tear open within itself and a
sheet of
jagged ice and sleet begins to
pour downward into

734
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:12,129
the center of this undead horde. As it
does, you
can see probably a good 25, 30
of these are just

735
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:19,269
blown apart, bone shards scattered
around and you
can see bits of rusted
metal weapons and armor

736
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:25,209
thrown left and right. The ice then
coalesces over
the floor of this area
and some of the skeletons

737
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:31,490
just slip, but they keep marching
forward. It
definitely took a chunk, but
as it continues

738
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,921
pushing forward--

739
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:36,899
MARISHA: Now we can run.

740
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:41,110
LAURA: Good job. I grab the back of her 
shirt and yank her towards me.

741
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:47,252
MATT: You guys make your way down the
tree.
As you get to the bottom of the
tree, the zombie

742
00:55:47,352 --> 00:55:55,528
giant has taken notice of the sudden
flashing of
light and the movement in
the tree and is bounding

743
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,638
towards the tree after you guys.

744
00:55:57,738 --> 00:55:59,583
LAURA: Are we running?

745
00:55:59,683 --> 00:56:02,123
TRAVIS: Are we going to the Alcove or
going to the
treeline?

746
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:05,832
TALIESIN: I say we go to the treeline,
and I say
that you take a couple shots
as we're heading--

747
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,405
LAURA: I'm definitely doing that, yes.
I'm going
to shoot at the giant as we're
running. Hunter's

748
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:11,505
Mark him.

749
00:56:11,492 --> 00:56:14,252
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark, turning
around,
looking at the giant.

750
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:17,515
MARISHA: As she says that, I'm going to
go ahead
and start casting my Call
Lightning spell.

751
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:22,599
MATT: Okay. So you land and you cast
Call
Lightning. The fog that you
created, Scanlan?

752
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:23,699
SAM: Yes.

753
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:28,744
MATT: Has formed up. You start seeing
shapes;
these terrifying skeletal faces
begin to appear

754
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:35,591
through the fog as the rest of the army
begins to
push through. The clouds
coalescing above Keyleth

755
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:39,611
as you get your Call Lightning ready,
you marking
the zombie giant, you guys
begin bolting out of

756
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:43,791
the way. Trinket comes running up behind
you, Vex,
and picks you up onto his
back, and you guys begin

757
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:46,251
rushing off toward the treeline-- to the
west or
the east?

758
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:47,510
LAURA: Can I shoot him?

759
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,170
MARISHA: Yeah, as I turn around, I Call
Lightning
on the giant.

760
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:52,575
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage on
that.

761
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:56,063
MARISHA: And it's cloudy, so I get how
much more?

762
00:56:56,163 --> 00:57:00,259
MATT: I don't know, how much do you get
more on
that? Call Lightning would be...

763
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:03,151
SAM: While you decide, which way are we
going,
Percy? West or east?

764
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:07,972
MATT: 3d10. It does an additional d10.
It does
4d10.

765
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:12,452
LAURA: And I'm going to shoot him
through my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel
as we're going away, too.

766
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:13,913
MATT: Okay.

767
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:21,692
TALIESIN: So the passage to the castle
I'm aware
of is to the west, and then
the one that Stonefell

768
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,462
mentioned is to the east?

769
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:26,442
TRAVIS: Do we go to the treeline by the
castle?

770
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:28,114
MATT: No, the one Stonefell mentioned
was the
same.

771
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:28,513
TALIESIN: Was the same?

772
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,032
MATT: It wasn't Stonefell, it was Vouk.

773
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:31,233
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you.

774
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:33,293
MATT: But yeah. He was referring to the
same one.

775
00:57:33,072 --> 00:57:35,712
TALIESIN: Treeline to the west so that
we can
attack first thing.

776
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:37,212
LAURA: 22. Twice.

777
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:38,412
MATT: 22 hits.

778
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:40,032
LAURA: And then three on the last one.

779
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:41,152
MATT: Okay, yeah.

780
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:43,352
LAURA: Well, it's technically 14 on the
last one.

781
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:46,274
MATT: For him? Still hits.

782
00:57:46,374 --> 00:57:47,374
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

783
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:50,312
MATT: It's a big target. Big target, lot
of hit
points.

784
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:55,422
MARISHA: And as she's brewing up her
bow, I'm
behind her and just bring down
the bolt for 32

785
00:57:55,522 --> 00:57:56,522
damage.

786
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,600
MATT: Damn. (lightning sound) You can
see the bolt
strikes the front of the
zombie giant right as it

787
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:05,842
starts swinging after you guys. The bolt
hits its
shoulder and blasts a chunk of
its shoulder blade

788
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:10,723
off. You see bone shards fire behind,
and there's
a giant piece of its torso
now missing where the

789
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:15,162
bolt hit. (groans) Stumbles back onto
its back
foot and catches itself, almost
toppling over.

790
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:17,683
MARISHA: Just start backing up. "Vex?"

791
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:22,134
MATT: It starts lumbering forward again
as Vex
releases her arrow, which splits
into three.

792
00:58:22,234 --> 00:58:23,426
MARISHA: Vex?

793
00:58:23,526 --> 00:58:25,773
LAURA: 54 points of damage.

794
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:26,873
MARISHA: Kill it!

795
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:35,000
MATT: Nice! (impact sounds) All the
arrows
blasting into its body, you can
see they sink in

796
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:40,185
and burst on the inside. There's a
little, a dull
glow as this burst of
electrical energy hits from

797
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:45,894
underneath its sickly zombified flesh.
At which
point, there's a slight delay
before it (explosion

798
00:58:45,994 --> 00:58:50,683
sound) bubbles forth and a bit of its
internal
liquid just spews out like a
boil. You can see

799
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:57,210
it's definitely taking damage, and it
keeps
pushing forward. Yeah, it's still
moving towards

800
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,310
you guys.

801
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,515
LIAM: How far away is it?

802
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:00,746
TALIESIN: For gods' sakes!

803
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,886
MATT: It's about ten feet from you guys
right
now.

804
00:59:02,808 --> 00:59:10,714
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News. I'm
shooting it
with Bad News, and I'm going
for an aimed shot to

805
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,355
the legs.

806
00:59:12,455 --> 00:59:18,154
MATT: Okay. The moment it would take for
you to
stop and pull out Bad News, by
the way, the moment

807
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,934
you guys are turning around to attack
it, it has
gotten within range to hit,
so this is all

808
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:25,765
happening simultaneously, so it's going
to get two
strikes as you guys get your
attacks, as well.

809
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:27,176
MARISHA: What are you doing?

810
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:28,963
MATT: So. Go ahead and roll your attack.

811
00:59:29,063 --> 00:59:30,063
LIAM: I did.

812
00:59:29,924 --> 00:59:30,924
MATT: What did you get?

813
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:31,755
LIAM: 27 and an 18.

814
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:32,574
MATT: Both hit.

815
00:59:32,585 --> 00:59:34,725
TALIESIN: I got 28.

816
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:41,624
MATT: Okay. And against Percy, that is a
17 and a
20.

817
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,184
TALIESIN: 17 misses. The 20 hits.

818
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:55,541
MATT: Okay. You take 16 points of
bludgeoning
damage as its fist comes
down and (whack) slams

819
00:59:55,641 --> 01:00:00,155
into your side just as Bad News fires
off and your
daggers go (dagger sounds)
towards it.

820
01:00:00,255 --> 01:00:02,508
LIAM: Keen Dagger, Flametongue, combined
20 hit
points.

821
01:00:02,608 --> 01:00:05,071
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

822
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:09,661
MARISHA: And as soon as I'm able, I'm
backing up
and bringing down another
lightning bolt.

823
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:12,761
LAURA: Well, I've got another attack.
That was
just one attack that I did.

824
01:00:11,944 --> 01:00:13,700
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

825
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,541
SAM: You need your spells. We need to
hide. We
need to run.

826
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:21,821
MARISHA: It's okay, this is a
concentration spell.
I can keep doing
it. I'm not blowing spells on it.

827
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:25,440
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage, plus he's
knocked
prone.

828
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,070
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. Through the
daggers--

829
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,330
TALIESIN: Oh, he can make a con saving
throw,
though.

830
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:36,202
MATT: It doesn't matter. It still
manages to keep
its zombie form, though
it seems like every single

831
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:40,251
hit you're taking chunks off its body,
but it
continues to push through the
damage until

832
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:45,120
eventually it swings at you with the
hit, Bad News
goes off as it blasts
through the center of its

833
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,390
torso and takes out the back of its
spine. It
can't keep its physical form
together, and as its

834
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,301
body lunges forward, you throw both of
your
daggers, which go (thoonk thoonk)
into each of its

835
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:58,982
eyes. It falls forward. The torso seems
to roll on
impact and come after you
like a slow-moving

836
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:03,083
boulder for a few feet, but since you're
all
moving forward, you manage to outrun
it, just

837
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:07,094
barely keeping out of the way. The
legs
walk on their own for two more
steps before it

838
01:01:07,194 --> 01:01:14,205
just falls forward into the mud,
relieving all its
intestines into the
rain-soaked ground.

839
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:15,727
SAM: Let's get out of here!

840
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:16,931
MARISHA: Go, go, go. Run!

841
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:18,432
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace!

842
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:20,062
TRAVIS: Aggressive flower girl.

843
01:01:20,162 --> 01:01:23,322
MARISHA: Do I see any other-- as we're
running
through--

844
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:24,705
LAURA: Just run, Keyleth!

845
01:01:24,805 --> 01:01:27,085
LIAM: I grab Keyleth by the arm and I
just pull
and run.

846
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:30,384
MATT: You guys go running back and as
you're
looking over your shoulder you
can see the

847
01:01:29,802 --> 01:01:36,252
skeletal army swarming the center of the
square
and pouring into the streets. It
seems that the

848
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:42,422
Briarwoods had their own reserve
anti-riot
campaign at the ready.

849
01:01:42,522 --> 01:01:44,593
LAURA: Oh, are they going to take out
everybody?

850
01:01:44,693 --> 01:01:46,182
MARISHA: We can't go, we can't go!

851
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:49,118
SAM: We have to go. We have nothing
left.

852
01:01:49,218 --> 01:01:51,778
MATT: And with that, we're going to
conclude
tonight's session.

853
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,263
(groaning)

854
01:01:53,363 --> 01:01:58,082
MATT: We'll be returning next week on
that note.

855
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:02,673
TRAVIS: (laughs) You son of a bitch, I
love it.

856
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:08,495
MATT: All right, so we're going to take
a little break
here while we set up for
Critmas. Quick one, very

857
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:13,051
quick, we'll be back here in just a few
minutes,
for those who want to hang in
and watch how

858
01:02:13,151 --> 01:02:15,102
ridiculously amazing this community is.

859
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:17,694
LAURA: Oh my gosh. There's like, there's
a lot.

860
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:19,352
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys are crazy.

861
01:02:19,452 --> 01:02:21,324
LIAM: Buckle up!

862
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:24,043
MATT: All right, quick break. See you in
a
second.
