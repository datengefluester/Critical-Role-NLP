1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,312
MATT: Hello and welcome to Critical Role, the game
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:10,425
around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we
have an interesting continuation of the story;

3
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:14,286
we'll be picking up here shortly. First and
foremost, we're going to get ourselves through

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:19,651
a few announcements and some cool things you guys
should know. So, first and foremost for returning

5
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:25,095
fans and people watching the show, thank you, and
if this your first time live or your first time

6
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:32,084
seeing the show, hopefully you're not too confused
and welcome as well. First and foremost, for those

7
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:36,255
who haven't seen it yet we've been doing Spotify
playlists for each of the players and the

8
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:41,268
characters; we just finished that whole sequence
with mine that went up today, so if you haven't

9
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:45,517
had a chance to check it out you can go ahead and
check it out. I did a playlist based around many

10
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:51,581
of the NPCs in the world of Exandria that Vox
Machina have come across and just a couple little

11
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:56,882
tidbits about their characters and their
backgrounds and one song per NPC that rounds out

12
00:00:56,882 --> 00:01:01,973
their personalities, so check it out if you're
interested. Hopefully you like it and you also get

13
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,052
an eye into my taste in music, too.

14
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:08,316
SAM: A lot of classic rock!

15
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:11,885
MATT: We had a new comic come up this week, didn't
we?

16
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:12,830
TALIESIN: We have a new comic!

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,760
MARISHA: New comic!

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,384
LIAM: Drink!

19
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:22,104
MARISHA: Yes, based off of real events that
happened in real life and in game.

20
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:23,777
SAM: That's true.

21
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:26,256
TALIESIN: Who won that drinking contest in real
life?

22
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:27,253
LAURA: Ashley.

23
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,278
TALIESIN: I was trying to remember.

24
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,325
MARISHA: I think Ashley.

25
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:30,628
TALIESIN: Who lost that drinking contest, if I
recall?

26
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:31,725
MATT: Laura.

27
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,058
(laughter)

28
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,512
LAURA: I lost so hard.

29
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:39,723
MARISHA: But the pitchers is actually how you have
to do it, so, but we just didn't post-- it's like

30
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:45,950
the rules are for alcohol commercials. As long as
you're not actually physically drinking it,

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,940
it's fine.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,925
MATT: I will say, Laura, you plop down drunkenly
very adorably.

33
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:50,973
LAURA: Shush, you.

34
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:53,384
(laughter)

35
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,387
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:01:55,387 --> 00:02:03,106
MATT: All right, cool, so go check out the comic,
drawn by our wonderful artist Wendy, and this is

37
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:08,099
all leading into a retelling of the Winter's Crest
festival, the first one that Vox Machina had in

38
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:16,119
the city of Westrun, so go check it out and see.
Other updates: my class update also went up

39
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:22,159
yesterday and it was actually just updated before
the show tonight with a couple of fixes to some of

40
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,435
the text and stuff, so if you've already
downloaded, go to the website and download the

41
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:30,226
newest one, it's 1.2. It's called the Bloodhunter;
it's a retool of the Witchhunter, taking it away

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,037
from the promotional aspect that it was tied to
back in October. I was able to retool it and make

43
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:40,176
it something a little more wholly my own and my
own unique design as opposed to being tied to the

44
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:45,060
preexisting IP. So it's got some cool abilities. I
hope you like it. If you feel like running it in

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,824
your game or allowing your players to do so, have
fun.

46
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:49,051
MARISHA: And it's got the seal of approval.

47
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:55,098
MATT: Not the seal of approval, I would say. I did
manage to have some wonderful feedback from Mike

48
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:58,560
Mearls from Dungeons and Dragons at Wizards of the
Coast. He was very very sweet enough to give me

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,657
notes and ideas when I was going through the
redesign process so thank you tremendously Mike

50
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:08,515
for that. It's still my real first homebrew class
that I've ever designed, so it's far from perfect

51
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:13,450
and there'll be adjustments as time goes on and
play tests and balance things come through, so be

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:22,306
gentle. But it should at least be fun. Let's see.
Marisha! You wanted to talk about Super Power Beat

53
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,427
Down real fast.

54
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:27,877
MARISHA: Yeah, there was a new Super Power Beat
Down that came out today where we are challenging

55
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:31,575
Darth Maul versus Spider-man. Because, why not?

56
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,382
TALIESIN: Because it's Christmas.

57
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,552
MATT: (laughing) Because it's Christmas?

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:42,939
MARISHA: Why not. But you should check it out
because we have a very fun cameo by someone who I

59
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,108
don't want to spoil.

60
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,587
SAM: (laughs) It's not me!

61
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,960
MARISHA: It's not Sam.

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,243
SAM: No, it's really not.

63
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:57,038
MARISHA: No, it's really not. But his name might
rhyme with Pan Me.

64
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:02,109
SAM: Bahn mi, the Vietnamese sandwich that you can
get in many places?

65
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:07,165
MARISHA: Yes. It rhymes with bahn me. No, it
doesn't, actually.

66
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,667
LIAM: You got Ang Lee to be in your short?!

67
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,829
SAM: Ang Lee!

68
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,035
MATT: That's crazy!

69
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,846
TALIESIN: I'm really lost right now. I'm genuinely
lost.

70
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,873
MARISHA: The chat room gets it, don't you?

71
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,114
TRAVIS: Pan Me?

72
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,241
LAURA: That's major!

73
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,367
MARISHA: His name... yeah! There's a cameo in
there.

74
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,917
LIAM: He directed The Hulk! And The Ice Storm!

75
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,249
MATT: The not-good one!

76
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:29,435
ALL: Oh...

77
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,136
TALIESIN: And now that cameo's being edited out.

78
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,155
MATT: Just saying.

79
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:36,924
LAURA: You'll never work on broken... what is it?
Mountain? Brokeback Mountain II? That was a

80
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,416
horrible joke. Just forget I said that.

81
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,037
(laughter)

82
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:44,332
MATT: No. If the internet's been watching--

83
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:45,844
ASHLEY: I thought it was funny.

84
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:48,482
MATT: If the internet's been paying attention,
they'll know that I've practically already been in

85
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,828
Brokeback Mountain II.

86
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,522
TALIESIN: Speaking of which, you're in a thing
this week.

87
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:52,745
MATT: Oh yeah.

88
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,089
LIAM: Get it, girl!

89
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:01,795
MATT: So, on Hulu, there's the new Rocket Jump
series that went up, and our dear friend Ashly

90
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:07,701
Burch, a very talented girl, wrote and directed a
very awesome, really hilarious sketch that is a

91
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:14,376
loving parody of fanfiction on the internet and
fan cultures colliding. And I had the pleasure of

92
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:20,944
briefly having a cameo as Loki in it, and I'm
not going to spoil the ending, because it's a

93
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,206
whopper.

94
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,415
(laughter)

95
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,819
LIAM: It's a happy ending.

96
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:34,510
MATT: It's a very happy ending with multiple happy
endings. All over. So, you can go check that out.

97
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,239
And I'm sorry.

98
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,518
MARISHA: "And I'm sorry."

99
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,642
MATT: And I'm sorry.

100
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:40,929
LIAM: You're welcome.

101
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:44,813
MATT: (laughs) Depending on who I'm talking to.
Another quick awesome announcement, this is huge:

102
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:47,901
Ashley, can you please wear headphones, a slight
echo is coming through?

103
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,446
ASHLEY: Yeah.

104
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:58,112
MATT: Thank you. So, if you guys could all help
her do that, that would be great. Next week is our

105
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,354
last episode before the holiday break.

106
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:01,540
LAURA: Ever.

107
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,118
MATT: No, don't even say that! We've already had
that rumor go around apparently, like, "Oh my god,

108
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,519
is the show going to end forever?" I'm like, no!

109
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,283
LIAM: As long as they'll let us do this, we're
going to do it.

110
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:11,170
MATT: Yeah.

111
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,864
SAM: Or as long as Matt doesn't kill us all.

112
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:23,765
MATT: Oh, we'll just reroll characters. Yeah, and
we'll all play Rifts. It'll be good. No. So, next

113
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:28,552
week will be our last episode before the break.
We'll be returning on January 7th. But in the

114
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:33,135
meantime, everyone will be enjoying time with
their families and such. Enjoy your two week break

115
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:40,139
off. I know we will. Also, once again just a
reminder, we have our Critmas sweaters available.

116
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,722
SAM: I'm modeling one right now!

117
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,723
LAURA: Also available in green.

118
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:55,620
SAM: It's lovely. The fabric is soft. It fits
snugly and warmly... but not too warm. I think...

119
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,093
I would pay 50 dollars for a sweater like this.

120
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,487
TALIESIN: You look like you're snugly in there, I
must say.

121
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,575
LIAM: It's got your poops right on it.

122
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:05,380
SAM: It keeps my poops nice and snug.

123
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,851
LAURA: Poop through a cone.

124
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,752
SAM: It's got two pockets for two poops.

125
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:18,510
MATT: You can't beat promotion like this, folks.
Check out the Geek and Sundry website. They have

126
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,674
all of the awesome stuff up there so you can get
those last-minute presents for your friends and

127
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:26,464
family who hopefully haven't seen the show so
they're really confused what you get them.

128
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:29,132
MARISHA: Yeah, like, "Dude! I got you something I
like!"

129
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:33,875
MATT: Yeah, hey, works out well. It's the season
of the Homer bowling ball. Marisha, you want to

130
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,996
talk about the Boonzy Arts candles?

131
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:43,211
MARISHA: Oh, yes, the Boonzy Arts candles. I meant
to grab those. The D&amp;D-related candles that I

132
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:50,930
plugged back when we were doing the Slayer's Take
episodes forever ago. They had a Kickstarter. They

133
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,594
are out now and you can buy them on their website
at BoonzyArts.com. Yes, and we have a set that we

134
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:04,263
were going to be doing in a giveaway as well that
she delivered that I'll find during break.

135
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:10,271
MATT: There you have it. Also as a reminder, we
have Wyrmwood Gaming that does the really awesome

136
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:13,740
high-quality gamer stuff.

137
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,388
LIAM: An excellent Christmas gift, or Critmas
gift, a Wyrmwood Gaming box would be. If you use

138
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:28,592
the code CritRole, you'll get free shipping. And
they are lovely and fancy and they will make a

139
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,175
nice, handsome Christmas present.

140
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,911
TRAVIS: And they will poop in your box for the
delivery.

141
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,736
MATT: You have to request that.

142
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,687
TALIESIN: That was only you.

143
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,870
LIAM: Sam will do that.

144
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,626
SAM: I will do that if you request.

145
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,505
ASHLEY: Oh man, I can't wait to get mine!

146
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,157
(laughter)

147
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,955
ASHLEY: Including the poo.

148
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:53,516
SAM: Ashley, we can see the sparkle on your eyes
is messing with the cameras. Can you also wear

149
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:57,366
something over your eyes? So, headphones and also
cover your eyes.

150
00:08:57,366 --> 00:09:02,518
ASHLEY: (laughs) I don't know.

151
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,953
TRAVIS: No promises, you guys.

152
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,898
ASHLEY: I didn't have a comeback for that one.

153
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:14,756
MATT: Couple of last things. The Critter's
Guide to Critmas is going up tomorrow, isn't it?

154
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,304
MARISHA: Tomorrow. At 6AM.

155
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,342
MATT: 6AM.

156
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:18,974
SAM: You're going to wake up for that?

157
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:30,465
MARISHA: Like the Macy's Day Parade. No. But it'll
be up that early. Now that we've had an awesome

158
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:38,283
year of amazing Critmases, we've had a few ideas
that the Critters actually gave us to focus the

159
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:41,365
idea of Critmas a little bit.

160
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,001
TALIESIN: The spirit of Critmas.

161
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,786
SAM: On what it originally was, Jesus Crit.

162
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,023
(laughter)

163
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,922
SAM: That's what the holiday was always about.

164
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,050
TRAVIS: No.

165
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,835
SAM: And now we're getting it back to Jesus Crit.

166
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:57,682
(laughter)

167
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,211
SAM: No?

168
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,281
MARISHA: Yep. We'll leave it at that.

169
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,929
TRAVIS: You can't do any better that.

170
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:12,739
MATT: So, tomorrow you'll be able to read this
really inaccurate description by Sam Riegel-- the

171
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:17,171
Critter's Guide to Critmas. And last but not
least, if anybody has any other announcements or

172
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:22,116
projects coming up that they'd like to mention.
There's a Wii U game that just came out called

173
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,281
Xenoblade Chronicles X where I voice a character
named Lao, that just came out recently, so if

174
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:32,072
you're a fan of those awesome RPGs, I will be
really subdued and arrogant in your face.

175
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,989
TRAVIS: Subdued and arrogant.

176
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,421
TALIESIN: We get that for free.

177
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,921
MATT: Exactly. Every week. Anything else, guys? We
good?

178
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,182
TALIESIN: Yeah.

179
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,643
MATT: All righty. Now let's get down to the nitty
gritty.

180
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,829
(sound effect noises)

181
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,810
TRAVIS: Was that "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

182
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,084
SAM: Yeah. Of course. It's got to be, right?

183
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:59,910
MATT: The lights swish. All right. So, to get you
guys up to speed as fast as I can-- this is a

184
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,823
really long arc. The Briarwoods, being a family
that five years ago took over the city of

185
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:11,983
Whitestone, where Percy hails from, murdered his
family, and he barely escaped with his life, years

186
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:20,709
later, came back into the folds of Vox Machina's
existence, and it was decided to go ahead and hunt

187
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:25,554
them down and save the city of Whitestone. Upon
arriving, they began to stir rebellion in the town

188
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:32,087
against this horrible undead menace controlled by
Lady Briarwood herself. After this rebellion was

189
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:37,558
incited, fires were burning, individuals were
killed that were responsible for keeping the

190
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:42,316
people down and just generally bad people all
around were being slaughtered by our intrepid

191
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:49,376
adventurers. They made their way into Whitestone
Castle, where they had uncovered some information

192
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,458
about the ziggurat, a project in which the
Briarwoods had been developing something beneath

193
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:58,015
the city of Whitestone, and discovered that
Percy's sister Cassandra, who was thought to be

194
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:02,811
dead long ago, actually still survived and was
being kept in the castle. She joined the party as

195
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:08,978
you guys fought your way down underneath the city
of Whitestone through a series of tunnels, finding

196
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:16,112
yourselves unintentionally locked within a trap, a
retooled version of what was previously an acid

197
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:20,106
distillery for the whitestone that's actually
mined from the surrounding mountains, and thought

198
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:25,376
left for dead by the Briarwoods themselves. In
which Vax was charmed and taken along with them,

199
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,998
and Cassandra showed herself--

200
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,165
LAURA: You were the one who got us into the acid
in the first place. Thank you for that.

201
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,858
LIAM: You don't think they would have done that?

202
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,469
LAURA: I don't know.

203
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,535
TRAVIS: We'll never know.

204
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:35,908
LAURA: We'll never know.

205
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:41,876
MARISHA: Acid sucks. I never want to encounter
acid again. Every time we do, it's bad. It's

206
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,788
always bad.

207
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:48,737
MATT: Well, acid's bad in general, you know, it's
not like, "Oh, this acid's fine."

208
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,422
LIAM: Citric acid is pretty good.

209
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,261
LAURA: Pretty delicious.

210
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,520
MARISHA: Preserves apples.

211
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,709
MATT: I stand corrected.

212
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,605
LIAM: Could it be a citric acid trap?

213
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:59,632
MATT: No. It's probably not going to happen.

214
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:04,004
TRAVIS: Damn it, we should have done that 
check last time.

215
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:07,281
"Can we check for citric acid?" 
"You can certainly try."

216
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:09,422
(laughter)

217
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,259
MATT: It's not acid resistance on your armor, it's
citric acid resistance.

218
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,475
SAM: You don't get scurvy?

219
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:24,628
MATT: Very possible. Anyway, back to the story.
Upon facing the danger of this trap, and seeing

220
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:30,387
Cassandra turn redcoat to them with the
Briarwoods, the party managed to think their way

221
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:34,379
out of the trap before too much damage was taken,
and following the Briarwoods to the final chamber

222
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,717
where the ziggurat was constructed, where apparently
there is some sort of ritual underway to some

223
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:44,368
entity they worship or work with that they refer
to as "The Whispered One." Upon following, the

224
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:48,596
party dividing up and following up the sides of
the ziggurat, they managed to catch an encounter

225
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,868
with the Briarwoods, a charmed Vax, and Cassandra
before they could enter the actual ritual

226
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:54,967
chamber.

227
00:13:54,967 --> 00:14:01,487
A battle commenced where, thanks to proper
preparation, did not go all so poorly, and in the

228
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:08,207
process Sylas Briarwood was destroyed through a
combination of Sunbeam via Keyleth and some Pike

229
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:16,148
shield deflection-- a very "Avengers" moment with
a hint of phallic imagery. Sylas's destruction

230
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:22,417
sent Delilah into a mournful wail and she decided
to try and complete the ritual herself, although

231
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:27,531
it may or may not have been too soon to do so.
Dimension Doored her way into the ritual room,

232
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:32,799
which you guys followed over the wall. She seemed
to complete the ritual, creating this small

233
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:41,127
vacuous spinning black sphere that is locked in
place. Vex was nearly felled by a spell as she

234
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:49,223
attempted to fly in and stop it. The party then
rushed in to aid Vex. Percy took a shot that

235
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:55,895
intentionally did not finish Lady Briarwood, just
taking off her right arm as she fell unconscious,

236
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,211
bleeding out.

237
00:14:57,211 --> 00:15:01,791
Vex, unconscious from the fall and also on the
cusp of dying, the party rushed in to help her and

238
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:09,656
realized seemingly the vicinity around this orb
had cut all magic. So thus, they were snatched up

239
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:16,429
and escorted off the side of the ziggurat, and
that was where we left the last game. To pick up

240
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,860
where we were, who had Vex in their arms last
time? Was that you?

241
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,811
LIAM: Grog.

242
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:28,093
MATT: Grog, you have Vex in your arms. Who has
Delilah? And who has Cassandra?

243
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,569
LIAM: Grog has both.

244
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:32,443
LAURA: He has both of us. I'm piled on top of
Delilah.

245
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:39,717
MATT: Okay. So, you have Delilah and and Vex. Who
has Cassandra?

246
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,325
TALIESIN: I think I have Cassandra.

247
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:49,879
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys are rushing down the
steps of the ziggurat itself, the green glass-like

248
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:55,588
jade material slowly fading into the whitestone as
you rush towards the base with what little bit of

249
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,248
light was available to you from the small bits of
torches placed at the bottom of the ziggurat and

250
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:03,104
what light sources you brought with you. You find
yourselves at the very bottom of the dirt, looking

251
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:09,602
around. There's the exit where you guys originally
entered this chamber. You do also see a number of

252
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:17,557
small metallic carts, some turned on their sides;
you can see crumpled bits of whitestone and

253
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:24,396
shards of that green glass residuum material left
out. You can see there's piles of leftover

254
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:28,310
building materials that are scattered about the
floor of this area.

255
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,462
LIAM: Are you saying that Keyleth and I are caught
up, at this point? Because I know that people

256
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:39,260
started going out of the temple, Keyleth ran in, I
handed Vex to Grog, I ran after.

257
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,792
MATT: So you guys are still a little bit behind
the rest of the group. You're on your way now,

258
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,545
you're just now rushing down the stairs of the
ziggurat while the rest of you have reached the

259
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,879
bottom.

260
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,335
TRAVIS: She rolled that natural 20 that kept her
from probably getting sucked into Uranus.

261
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:53,211
MARISHA: Yep. Probably.

262
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,973
MATT: Save versus Uranus.

263
00:16:54,973 --> 00:17:00,799
MARISHA: That would have been bad. Save versus
Uranus? Is that what you said?

264
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,908
MATT: That is what I said.

265
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,160
LIAM: Put it in the handbook.

266
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,748
TALIESIN: It's like we're 12.

267
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:08,050
MATT: The next errata document.

268
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,841
TRAVIS: And Lady Briarwood is manacled.

269
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:14,737
MATT: She's manacled behind you. And Cassandra is
tied up. As the rest of you rush down to the

270
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:20,193
bottom, minus Vax and Keyleth, do you wish to wait
for them, or push on to the tunnel where you

271
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:20,961
entered?

272
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,036
TRAVIS: Fuck them. We keep running. We're trying
to get out of the area, right?

273
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:26,071
LAURA: I'm barely conscious right now, right?

274
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:30,350
MARISHA: I was yelling in the earpiece, fuck it,
run!

275
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,271
MATT: So you know that they're following you.

276
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:33,354
LAURA: Grog.

277
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:34,646
TRAVIS: Yes?

278
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:38,766
LAURA: Get this bitch off of me.

279
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,532
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Yeah, fuck it. It's like
carrying coats. Hold on. So I put one in each

280
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,630
arm. There you go.

281
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,613
LAURA: Are we leaving?

282
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,352
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're trying to get out of here as
fast as we can. How are you feeling?

283
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:53,121
LAURA: Grog. And I reach up and grab onto his
beard. This is a beautiful beard.

284
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,322
Watch out for traps.

285
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,359
MATT: So at this point, as you're having this
discussion, you guys are rushing down, and you

286
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,968
guys see this as you're rushing down the ziggurat,
the radiant energy that is currently the form of

287
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:08,969
Pike seems to have slowly dwindled and she looks
over her shoulder with a look of immediate fear as

288
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,292
it blinks out.

289
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,795
MARISHA: What? Why the-- why?

290
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:18,372
SAM: Because of technology, and also the
story.

291
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:22,005
TRAVIS: (laughs) I didn't even know she was gone!

292
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,397
MARISHA: I didn't, either!

293
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,391
SAM: Pike, no! No, Pike!

294
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:32,674
MATT: It seems as if whatever anti-magical aura
has slowly pushed the divine connection that keeps

295
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:35,929
her present from the current vicinity.

296
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,626
MARISHA: Did your computer die?

297
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:40,184
SAM: Also, the battery died on the computer.

298
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:43,031
LIAM: It's that black orb!

299
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:47,400
LAURA: I didn't know. Where can we plug it in at?

300
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,604
MATT: So, you guys push on, making your way to the
cavern and heading back towards the undercroft

301
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,600
vicinity of Whitestone.

302
00:18:56,644 --> 00:19:01,613
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let me know when we leave that
big-ass room that the ziggurat is in. We're still

303
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:02,558
in it, right?

304
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,292
MATT: You guys have just now made your way towards
the exit tunnel, so you're just now leaving.

305
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,850
TRAVIS: I remember the tunnels sucking
booby-trap-wise.

306
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:16,022
TALIESIN: Not until we're past the gold room. The
glass room.

307
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,368
LIAM: I marked all the traps.

308
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:18,809
TALIESIN: All the traps are marked.

309
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,967
SAM: All the traps that we found.

310
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:24,907
LAURA: No, remember? There was one, the poison
dust one which we're immune to still.

311
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,628
TALIESIN: But that already got set off.

312
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:30,863
TRAVIS: Can I check for traps as I go?

313
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,587
MATT: Sure. Well, you push and make your way
into--

314
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,119
SAM: You're checking for traps?

315
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,070
TRAVIS: Yeah.

316
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,567
SAM: You're holding two ladies.

317
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,943
MATT: As you guys rush behind.

318
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,726
TRAVIS: Normal Saturday night, my friend.

319
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:42,762
SAM: Oh boy.

320
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:47,037
MATT: You head back into the tunnel having to
lower your head a little bit as you're carrying

321
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:50,697
this payload, you're lumbering through, giant
goliath body just stomping through--

322
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:54,009
MARISHA: A payload? He called you a payload.

323
00:19:54,009 --> 00:20:01,283
MATT: Yeah. You come to where there is the
partially-dissolved stone door, and you rush

324
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,318
underneath and using all of your back muscle--
make a strength check.

325
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:11,402
TRAVIS: Okay. That's good. 24.

326
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:15,371
MATT: (grunts) Tensing the entirety of your muscle
structure--

327
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:16,585
LAURA: I'm not that heavy.

328
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:20,018
MATT: Oh, it's not about you being heavy. It's
about the door itself not being quite large enough

329
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:25,335
for him to come through carrying that large of
people. You (grunts) lift it, and you hear the

330
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:31,598
stone (scraping noise) shift as it's forcefully
pushed up. You hear snaps of things breaking or

331
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:36,473
supports that were keeping it in place as you,
essentially, break the door and jam it upward,

332
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,612
giving you enough space to pull through the rest
of the party.

333
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,782
TRAVIS: I fucking hate doors. Don't we all?

334
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,898
SAM: We do.

335
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,110
MATT: Indeed. Greatest nemesis of Vox Machina.

336
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,118
TALIESIN: Is Cassandra awake or is she
unconscious?

337
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:48,084
MATT: She's unconscious now.

338
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,054
TALIESIN: Damn it.

339
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:57,377
MATT: You make your way into the top level of the
distillery room, down the pathway into the upward

340
00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:01,242
ramp to the opposite side, the door open, and you
are now outside of the distillery trap.

341
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:04,316
TRAVIS: It's the danger area.

342
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:05,825
LAURA: Oh no.

343
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:06,978
TRAVIS: You're out.

344
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,399
SAM: Wait, so who's at zero health?

345
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:10,572
TRAVIS: One point.

346
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,929
LAURA: I'm at one point of health.

347
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,447
SAM: We have potions, now. We're out of the
magic--

348
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:14,759
TRAVIS: Can't you heal some people?

349
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,824
TALIESIN: We can try a--

350
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,544
TRAVIS: I have potions, too, but--

351
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,944
MARISHA: Are we out of the room?

352
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,085
LAURA: We're out of the room.

353
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,146
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're out of the room.

354
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,246
MATT: You're not currently with them, though.
You're behind with Vax, trying to catch up.

355
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:29,252
TRAVIS: I have a common. Can I try giving Vex a
common healing potion?

356
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:32,269
MATT: Yeah. You want to stop for a second and pull
it out?

357
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,733
TRAVIS: I fucking drop Lady Briarwood on her face,
hard.

358
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:36,861
SAM: Oh no, she might die.

359
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:38,085
LAURA: Oh no, she could <i>die</i>, die.

360
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:43,297
MATT: Okay. She (thudding noise) rolls, bounces a
little bit from the sheer force of the throw.

361
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:47,481
You're not even paying attention as to whether or
not she's still breathing. You reach in your pouch

362
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:50,007
and bring out your potion. Set Vex down and hand
it to her.

363
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,448
TRAVIS: Please work.

364
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:55,918
MATT: You go ahead and heal 2d4 plus two hit
points.

365
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:57,677
LAURA: Oh! Really?!

366
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:58,786
MATT: Yeah.

367
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:07,253
LAURA: Okay. Where's my d4? Plus two. Oh, that's
good. That's a whole eight points.

368
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:10,007
MATT: There you go. That's actually a pretty good
roll.

369
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,102
TRAVIS: And it stays? It works?

370
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:15,579
MATT: At this point, as you guys have pushed
outside of that room, it appears to be functioning

371
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:16,408
again.

372
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:17,438
LAURA: Yay!

373
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:25,882
TRAVIS: Oh, good. That took. Can you heal people?
It's a yes or no question.

374
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,068
LAURA: I'm awake enough.

375
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,179
TALIESIN: I can try.

376
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,692
LAURA: I'm awake enough. I wake up and I cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

377
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,942
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll for that.

378
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,049
TALIESIN: I can't do that.

379
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,176
LAURA: I'm like, "Ooh, I love me so much. Cure
me."

380
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,589
MATT: At 1st level?

381
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:47,467
LAURA: I think 2nd level. I have enough.

382
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:54,371
MATT: So 2d8 plus your spellcasting modifier.
Whatever your wisdom modifier is.

383
00:22:54,371 --> 00:23:04,766
LAURA: That was not even as good as the common
potion. Oh. Well, sort of. 14.

384
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,354
MATT: Okay.

385
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,350
TRAVIS: Still pretty low.

386
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,125
LAURA: So, basically full hit points at this
point.

387
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:15,321
TRAVIS: I feel like we should heal you up just a
touch more. What are you at?

388
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,495
LAURA: 23 points.

389
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,076
TRAVIS: That's pretty fucking low.

390
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,349
SAM: All right. I'll give you my greater heal.

391
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:21,947
TRAVIS: I have one. She can have mine.

392
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,015
LAURA: Really?

393
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:23,970
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a giant.

394
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,372
SAM: No, I'll take this one. I want you to have my
greater healing potion. It would mean so much to

395
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:34,395
me if you would take it, drink.

396
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:35,542
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan.

397
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:39,445
SAM: No problem. If Pike were here, I'd give it to
her, but...

398
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,934
LAURA: Understandable.

399
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:44,085
SAM: She's not, so. You're pretty cool, too.

400
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:48,082
LAURA: Okay. Thanks, buddy. What do I roll for
that?

401
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:49,606
SAM: 4d4 plus four.

402
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:53,304
LAURA: Whoa. I feel so strong now.

403
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:56,046
TRAVIS: You'd better roll strong.

404
00:23:56,046 --> 00:24:03,569
LAURA: 11. So I'm at 34 points.

405
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,416
SAM: Hey, as a thank you for that.

406
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,656
LAURA: What?

407
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,229
SAM: What about that gun?

408
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:10,379
LAURA: Scanlan!

409
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:11,537
SAM: Just let me hold it!

410
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,646
TRAVIS: Oh, he did just give you a potion.

411
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:17,614
LAURA: I'm just letting you know, you're not
skilled with ranged attacks.

412
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:19,657
TALIESIN: There's nothing he can do with it,
anyway. I have all the ammunition.

413
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:20,666
LAURA: I know.

414
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:25,269
SAM: That's what you think. My pickpocket fingers
are faster than you could ever imagine.

415
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,807
TALIESIN: I really don't think they are.

416
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,942
TRAVIS: Sounds like a challenge!

417
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:36,590
MATT: At this point, Keyleth and Vax catch up to
the rest of you guys.

418
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,624
SAM: I'll take that.

419
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:43,517
TRAVIS: How did it go? Did you kill the little
black thing of death?

420
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:47,204
MARISHA: (slowly) No, I didn't.

421
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:54,403
TRAVIS: Vex gave Scanlan a gun. I don't think it's
loaded.

422
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:57,293
MARISHA: Oh, god. Be careful.

423
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:58,649
SAM: Does it look cool?

424
00:24:58,649 --> 00:24:59,724
TALIESIN: No.

425
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,642
LAURA: We need to take care of that orb.

426
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:10,933
MARISHA: No, I tried to jam a piece of the magic
glass. The jammy magic glass into it and-- I'm

427
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:20,418
probably lucky that I was able to pull away as
quickly as I did, because I think it eats

428
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,263
everything around it.

429
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,839
LAURA: So wait, it's still there?

430
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,069
MARISHA: Still there, yeah.

431
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,607
TRAVIS: Is it moving at all?

432
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,937
MARISHA: It's doing its really fast spinny thing.

433
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:34,337
TRAVIS: What about all the bodies in the room? Are
they still like, (moans)?

434
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:37,932
MARISHA: I thought I could maybe go into my
wildshape and bring down the building, I

435
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:43,527
thought maybe if I collapsed the building, maybe
it was drawing some sort of energy from the net of

436
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:49,959
intertwined bodies, but I couldn't, because it was
blocking all magic capabilities.

437
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:54,301
LAURA: Can I look over at Lady Briarwood and do a
check on her to see if she looks stable?

438
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:59,501
MATT: Sure. Which, at this point, just a note, in
all the chaos and all the intent, trying to get

439
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:04,610
things out of there, you're just now starting to
realize that the Seeming spell that you placed on

440
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,156
the whole party has also been canceled as part of
whatever this trigger anti-field was. So you all

441
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:13,898
look around and realize, oh, we aren't a bunch of
Percys and Cassandras.

442
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,195
TRAVIS: I'm beautiful again!

443
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,298
TALIESIN: Thank you?

444
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:18,673
LAURA: That's good, because I noticed your beard.

445
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:19,652
TRAVIS: That's right.

446
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:20,703
LAURA: That's right.

447
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:22,693
TALIESIN: Are you checking on Lady Briarwood?

448
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:23,540
LAURA: I am.

449
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,874
MATT: Trinket's nuzzling the body.

450
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,076
TALIESIN: Keep her unconscious.

451
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:27,144
LAURA: Trinket, careful.

452
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:29,215
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wake Cassandra up.

453
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:30,548
MATT: Okay.

454
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,348
(Skype sounds)

455
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:33,802
SAM: It's the magic.

456
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,023
LAURA: That's magic.

457
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:43,142
MATT: All right, so. You go ahead and check on
her. Go ahead and make--actually this is pretty

458
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:46,894
easy, you just go ahead and take a moment, you
just feel her for a pulse. She is currently still

459
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:56,318
alive. And with a flash of divine energy just past
the outskirts of this anti-magic field, you can

460
00:26:56,318 --> 00:27:01,941
see Pike's radiant ethereal form all of a sudden
reconstruct itself.

461
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:03,778
LAURA and MARISHA: Pike!

462
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:05,578
ASHLEY: I'm back!

463
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:07,351
SAM: Oh, thank god.

464
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:09,810
ASHLEY: We were killing Lady Briarwood?

465
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,684
SAM: No, we're okay. Everything's okay. Thank
Sarenrae you're back.

466
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:17,682
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I heal somebody?

467
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:20,948
SAM: We did that a bit while you were gone, but
yes.

468
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:25,819
LAURA: But I'm still pretty low! If you feel like
it, I would take it and I would be grateful.

469
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,278
ASHLEY: How's everybody else?

470
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,750
TRAVIS: Can you heal a couple of people?

471
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,740
ASHLEY: Yeah!

472
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,240
MARISHA: I'm a little shaky.

473
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,487
TALIESIN: I'm a little shaky, as well.

474
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,859
LAURA: Pike, heal us all. We love you.

475
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,556
ASHLEY: Okay. Let me do a Mass Cure Wounds. I have
that.

476
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,651
LIAM: Gather together, everyone, gather together.

477
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,883
MARISHA: Group hug!

478
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:45,973
LAURA: Oh wait, but wait! Don't let Lady Briarwood
in the circle of healing.

479
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:47,347
SAM: Wait, is she alive? Did you check her?

480
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:54,645
MATT: She is currently alive. She's unconscious.
And she's, thankfully from the blast and the sheer

481
00:27:54,645 --> 00:28:02,243
force of it, part of the wound was cauterized, but
she has been bleeding quite a bit on the run down

482
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:04,260
here, and she would probably need some sort of--

483
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,327
MARISHA: Should I stabilize her?

484
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:07,251
TRAVIS: Yeah, wait, stabilize her first.

485
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:11,188
LAURA: We're away from the fucking sacrifice area.
Maybe we should just kill her.

486
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:16,110
TALIESIN: I want to quickly check my gun. Is Lord
Briarwood's name still on it?

487
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:23,502
MATT: You go and inspect the barrel. No. Sylas
Briarwood is currently erased from the barrel.

488
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:27,437
TALIESIN: Let's hold off just a bit before we kill
her.

489
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:32,240
TRAVIS: I have some really dirty rags. Could I do
a medicine check and try and stabilize her

490
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,220
bleeding?

491
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,342
MATT: If you want to.

492
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,465
SAM: Dirty rags?

493
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,560
TRAVIS: 18!

494
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,581
SAM: Do you have medicine skills?

495
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:40,478
TRAVIS: Zero!

496
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:44,526
MATT: So yeah, as you guys are having this
conversation, Grog comes over and pulls out a

497
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:51,573
mottled mass of really filthy rags from the Bag of
Holding, probably used in various nose-wiping

498
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:52,516
circumstances.

499
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:53,698
TRAVIS: Or other things.

500
00:28:53,698 --> 00:29:03,004
MATT: But somehow it manages to stop the bleeding
and keep her relatively stable

501
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,342
for the moment, yeah.

502
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:11,267
TRAVIS: Okay, and then I take her by the foot and
I drag her on her face away from the group. Very

503
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,992
gently, but still by her foot.

504
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:13,794
MATT: Okay.

505
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,609
TALIESIN: Double-check. Perhaps gag her, as well.

506
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:18,508
TRAVIS: Oh right, yeah, she talks that shit,
doesn't she?

507
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:22,720
TALIESIN: We don't want her speaking, and she only
has one arm, so magic's going to be tricky.

508
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,085
LIAM: She can't do this kind of thing, but she can
still talk.

509
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,572
MATT: Pike, did you say you wanted to cast Mass
Cure Wounds, you said?

510
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:28,712
ASHLEY: Yes.

511
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:31,806
MATT: Okay, you can choose up to six creatures in
a 30-foot radius, so it's your choice who you want

512
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:32,787
to heal.

513
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:36,110
TALIESIN: She can't see us. Why are we holding our
hands up?

514
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,205
LAURA: I don't know.

515
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,908
TALIESIN: Actually, you can see us on the screen.
Never mind.

516
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,840
ASHLEY: I know, I have you guys on my iPad down
here, but you're delayed.

517
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,654
LIAM: There's six including all of us.

518
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:48,199
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll cure all the six people in
my family.

519
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:52,424
MATT: All right, so that's 3d8 plus five for you.

520
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,617
LAURA: Wow!

521
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,078
LIAM: Pour one out for your homies.

522
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:56,734
MARISHA: Roll high!

523
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:59,179
MATT: Oh, to have a cleric in the group again.

524
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,656
TRAVIS: I know, right? Shit! Life!

525
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:04,983
LAURA and MARISHA: She's rolling.

526
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:10,058
ASHLEY: 26!

527
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,168
ALL: Ooh!

528
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:15,439
(laughter)

529
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:20,162
MATT: Oh. Let this be a lesson to all the people
out there who think clerics are lame and nobody

530
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:21,464
loves them.

531
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:29,029
TRAVIS: We love them! Can I tear a piece of fabric
off of one of the three remaining fancy robes and

532
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:35,838
I tie it around Lady Briarwood's mouth? But like--
(muffled) in, and you know like (muffled) in the

533
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:37,962
teeth all-- she can't really enunciate.

534
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,699
MATT: Okay, so you pull it and you gag her around
the side of her mouth and as you end up

535
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,595
tying it, you see one of her eyes lulls open and
she kind of, (coughs, sputters).

536
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,308
TRAVIS: (yelps) Shit, she's awake!

537
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,668
SAM and LAURA: Punch her in the face!

538
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,639
SAM: No wait, don't. You'll kill her.

539
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:53,795
MATT: Up to you. What do you want to do?

540
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:54,822
SAM: Blindfold her!

541
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:55,912
TRAVIS: I slap her.

542
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,649
MATT: (laughing) Roll a strength check.

543
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,617
SAM: Shit!

544
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,152
(laughter)

545
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,321
SAM: He's going to kill her with a slap.

546
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:06,452
LAURA: She'll be knocked unconscious and she'll
have to save three times again.

547
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,636
TRAVIS: 21.

548
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:08,633
SAM: Oh that's good!

549
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:14,027
MATT: (whack) Right across her face. You hear a
resounding crack sound as it appears some part of

550
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:17,521
her cheek bone probably is going to be fairly
bruised tomorrow. But she is straight to

551
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,712
unconsciousness again.

552
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,237
(cheering)

553
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:22,238
TRAVIS: If you're curious, she's still alive.

554
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:23,268
TALIESIN: I can tell.

555
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:24,613
LAURA: She almost killed me.

556
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:26,455
MARISHA: Is she just unconscious?

557
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:28,228
MATT: She's still breathing.

558
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:30,470
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wake up Cassandra.

559
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,728
MATT: Okay.

560
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:33,470
TRAVIS: I did bandages on her real good.

561
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:38,142
MATT: As you're standing in the tunnel, they're
off to one side. You go over to where Cassandra

562
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:43,921
is. You briefly set her down to have this
conversation. She's still bound on her arms and

563
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:48,987
legs-- she was nearly hogtied by Grog when you
guys finished up at the top of the temple. She's

564
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:55,630
breathing. You can see, the dirt from being tossed
to the ground is caked in on where the tear marks

565
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:01,338
are down her face. You shake her gently and eventually
she comes to consciousness and her eyes

566
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:07,200
roll around for a moment, she glances over at you.
"Percy?"

567
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,172
TALIESIN: We will have a discussion later. In the
meantime, do you know what that thing in there is

568
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,781
and how do we stop it?

569
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:19,625
MATT: "I don't... what? What's going on?"

570
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,239
LAURA: The spinning orb of death.

571
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,713
MATT: She starts moving around, looking around the
tunnel real fast at everyone. "What happened?

572
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:26,298
"What's going on?"

573
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,244
TRAVIS: You betrayed some bitches, that's what you
did.

574
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:33,974
MATT: And as you say this, you see she reacts as
almost someone had just punched her in the chest

575
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:40,117
and the tears begin to flow down her face again,
and she, "I'm sorry."

576
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:42,421
TALIESIN: I'm going to slap her in the face.

577
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:46,203
MATT: Okay. (slap) Go ahead and roll a strength
check.

578
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:47,663
SAM: That's your sister, Percy!

579
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:49,836
LAURA: She might be unconscious too!

580
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:51,648
TALIESIN: Not with my strength!

581
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,251
TRAVIS: (jokingly) Natural 20.

582
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,149
(laughter)

583
00:32:55,149 --> 00:33:03,362
TALIESIN: 16. Well, actually my strength is still
thin because I still have a--

584
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,867
SAM: Oh! Negative two strength, right.

585
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:06,930
TALIESIN: So, 15.

586
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:15,677
MATT: 15, yeah okay. You smack her to get her
attention in this circumstance. She stops for a

587
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:20,192
second and gathers herself. Her breathing slows
and she stares off into space for a moment.

588
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:27,803
TALIESIN: I need my sister back. Are you awake?
Are you a terrible person? Do I want to strangle

589
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,004
you right now?

590
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:30,115
MATT: "Probably."

591
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:35,654
TALIESIN: Good. Then we can work with this. They
were building something down here. The Briarwoods

592
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:41,088
are no longer a problem. They were building
something-- what do you know about it? It maybe

593
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:46,218
started, it seems to be affecting magic. I think.

594
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:50,982
MATT: "I don't know. They wouldn't let me near
it."

595
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:53,162
LAURA: Don't lie to us anymore!

596
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:58,219
MATT: "I'm not lying! Do I have a reason to lie
right now?" And she looks over at you with an

597
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:10,583
intensity to her gaze that catches you not as
desperation, but as passionate self-loathing.

598
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:16,352
LIAM: You seem to really believe your words, but
you know your word is worth fuck all right now.

599
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:18,388
Fuck all.

600
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:33,529
MATT: "I know. I know." She leans her head down on
the side of this cavern wall and stares off into

601
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:47,017
space. "All that I know about this is that they've
been building it under the guidance of some other

602
00:34:47,017 --> 00:35:00,429
"person or entity. They referred to him many times
as the Whispered One. They're very secretive about

603
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:06,915
"it. The only reason I knew was because I overheard
a few conversations and questioned them about it. To

604
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:18,494
"which there was punishment. But they mainly kept
me to try and keep the people at bay. My job was

605
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:27,752
"to keep in contact with anyone who would attempt
to rise against them, and inform them. I would

606
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:33,153
"prevent any surprises, although apparently
(chuckles) and thankfully, I didn't do a very good job."

607
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:36,568
And she looks around the room at the rest of
you.

608
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:47,489
SAM: Can I check my history memory banks to see if
I know anything about the Whispered One or if that

609
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:48,588
jogs any memory?

610
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:50,032
MATT: Roll a religion check, Mr. Bard.

611
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:54,414
SAM: Religion check? Well, that's not good. 20.

612
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:56,022
LAURA: What?! Natural 20?

613
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:56,820
SAM: No.

614
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,709
LAURA: Damn it! I had a really strong reaction to
that.

615
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,679
SAM: Oh.

616
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,799
TRAVIS: Yes, the whispers!

617
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,058
MARISHA: He's whispering about the Whispered One!

618
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:08,280
SAM: He's gone! Where is he?

619
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
TRAVIS: This is the pre-show days!

620
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,189
LIAM: It's not new, it's just been a while.

621
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:12,367
TRAVIS: It's been a long time.

622
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,826
LAURA: Yeah, but he's on this side of the table.

623
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,348
TALIESIN: None of us have rolled this well in so
long.

624
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:17,182
TRAVIS: We used to play-- don't over-listen to
it!

625
00:36:17,182 --> 00:36:25,356
TALIESIN: (starts singing In the Hall of the
Mountain King)

626
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,250
LIAM: He is licking the inside of Sam's ear.

627
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,655
LAURA: Look at his eyes!

628
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:36,649
LIAM: Matthew is the Whispered One.

629
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:43,184
LAURA: He is the Whispered One! This is normally
the time when Sam would--

630
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,746
SAM: It was all tongue in my ear the whole time!

631
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:46,992
(laughter)

632
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:48,591
SAM: It was so dirty.

633
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:59,036
The Whispered One! I have a memory! I don't
know where I learned of this knowledge-- I am very

634
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:09,589
old-- but I did, at some point in my travels, I
remember reading about something. A lich king?

635
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,317
MATT: A lich entity, yeah.

636
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:19,727
SAM: Who wanted to be a god. And his name was
Vecna, and they called him the Whispered One.

637
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:25,717
That's all I remember, he tried to achieve great
power, and I don't know if he was successful or

638
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:26,694
not.

639
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,066
MARISHA: Oh boy.

640
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,789
LAURA: Cassandra, does any of that sound
familiar?

641
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:37,047
MATT: Cassandra shakes her head and says,
"Honestly, I didn't know anything beyond the name.

642
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:41,506
"I just knew they were very close with this
individual."

643
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:48,879
LAURA: When you betrayed us, you said you were
serving a higher purpose. Did they plan to

644
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,674
sacrifice you to him?

645
00:37:50,674 --> 00:38:02,025
MATT: "I know there was a blood ritual involved. I
did not know more than that. There was to be a

646
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:10,479
"gift of power should I give an element of my life
to this ritual." She shakes her head for a second.

647
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:23,047
She blinks her eyes, and she says, "I don't feel
like I was right in my head. I look back on so

648
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:34,488
"many decisions I've made, and all the people that
I've--" The tears just start flowing again.

649
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:40,956
LIAM: Insight check. (rolls) I'll take that. 14.

650
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:54,389
MATT: 14. Best that you can read off her is
there is a deep look of regret and sorrow in her

651
00:38:54,444 --> 00:39:00,310
face. And you do notice that, through most of this
conversation, as much as she's been able to talk

652
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:04,657
to all of you, she has been unable to make eye
contact with Percy.

653
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:15,755
LIAM: I'm going to walk over and plop down in
front of her and say, you've backed a losing

654
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:24,457
team. And that's not surprising, you having been
through what you've been through. That's all gone

655
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:36,284
now. Sylas is gone, Delilah is on death's door.
Whitestone needs to be tended to and protected. Do

656
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:44,576
you know anything that can help us save your
birthright here and now?

657
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:55,308
MATT: "I mean, you've already done half the job."
Her eyes look over at the unconscious Delilah in

658
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:57,788
the hallway.

659
00:39:57,788 --> 00:40:05,550
MARISHA: Cassandra, is there any reason why they'd
want to sacrifice you in particular?

660
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:20,976
MATT: She thinks hard for a second, her eyes
squinting. "I don't. They spoke very little--

661
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:30,650
"intentionally, I think-- of what they wanted to
do. To be honest, I think there was an element

662
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:39,203
"that even they didn't know quite what they were
doing. I was a tool. I was to be used. I had my

663
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:47,554
"purposes. I did my best to fulfill them."

664
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:54,289
TRAVIS: I've got a question. Do you care if I
smash the shit out of Lady Briarwood's head now?

665
00:40:54,289 --> 00:41:01,436
MATT: She glances over at her, and with a stern
look on her face she goes, "Someone needs to

666
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:08,543
"avenge my family." And for the first time she
looks over and makes eye contact with you. You

667
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:15,857
feel a pulse in your hand, like a heartbeat.
(thoom) The gun itself seems warmer and warmer,

668
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:23,524
and you guys all notice as a bit of smoke begins
to billow out the sides of Percy's sleeves. You

669
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:31,663
hear a familiar voice creep up in the back of your
head. "Percival."

670
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:34,207
TALIESIN: I walk up to Lady Briarwood.

671
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:36,810
MATT: "Here at your mercy."

672
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,439
TALIESIN: I put my gun to Lady Briarwood's
head.

673
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:41,614
SAM: Wait, Percy, you're going to shoot an unarmed
woman?

674
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:42,720
TRAVIS: Hush!

675
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,378
SAM: Don't shoot an unarmed woman.

676
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,618
TRAVIS: Unarmed? She tried to kill us.

677
00:41:46,618 --> 00:41:52,796
TALIESIN: You changed the deal. Take her name off
the gun.

678
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:58,988
MATT: "The deal was never changed."

679
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,412
TRAVIS: Who's he talking to?

680
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:02,368
MATT: "The deal was made."

681
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:09,700
TALIESIN: I pull the gun away. Things have
changed. We need to talk.

682
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,038
TRAVIS: All right?

683
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:14,130
SAM: Who's he talking to?

684
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,200
LIAM: I hold up my hand and shush the group with my
hand.

685
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:24,434
MATT: "You made a great sacrifice for my gifts,
Percival. Do not let it be in vain."

686
00:42:24,434 --> 00:42:40,975
TALIESIN: (sighs) Did I even want revenge before
I talked to you? Did I? I don't remember anymore.

687
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:57,245
What does she die for? What do I even need? I want
my country. I want my sister! I've killed two of

688
00:42:57,245 --> 00:43:06,319
those who have wronged me and nothing is better.
Nothing feels better, nothing is avenged. What is

689
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,331
this worth to you? And I put the gun back at her
head.

690
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:14,778
MATT: "Pull the trigger."

691
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:17,013
TRAVIS: I take out my hammer...

692
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:20,182
TALIESIN: Pull it back, put it to her, put it
back. "Maybe I will."

693
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:23,608
MATT: You're placing the gun against your own
head?

694
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,287
TALIESIN: And back to hers.

695
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:27,555
LAURA: Percival, don't!

696
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:29,005
MATT: "Percy, no!"

697
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:38,951
"Percival, don't do this. We made a deal."

698
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:50,576
TALIESIN: I put the gun to the side-- no, I'm
holding the gun on Briarwood. That deal was a

699
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:55,421
soft deal. It was a dream. It was a vision.

700
00:43:55,421 --> 00:44:05,568
MATT: "What are visions if not a window into the
future? You understand so little, Percival. Do not

701
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:09,141
"make me regret sharing this with you."

702
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:15,912
TALIESIN: I need more from you if you want
anything from me. I don't trust you anymore.

703
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:25,786
Besides. I put the gun to the hand of Lady
Briarwood and pull the trigger. The gun's broken

704
00:44:25,786 --> 00:44:39,426
anyway. I drop it. I'm not satisfied. I want my
money back.

705
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:45,915
MATT: (chuckles) The smoke still billows out from
you at this point.

706
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:48,789
TALIESIN: It's actually also still around her, it
occurs to me.

707
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:54,071
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

708
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:55,581
TALIESIN: Yep.

709
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:57,565
MARISHA: (mumbles) You have advantage.

710
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,452
TALIESIN: I have advantage! Thank you!

711
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:00,769
MATT: You do.

712
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:05,881
LIAM: I'm not doing anything, but I'm holding a
dagger and just watching Percy, and aiming at

713
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:07,058
Percy.

714
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:08,254
TALIESIN: Yay! 20.

715
00:45:08,254 --> 00:45:18,359
MATT: 20. You feel that warm pulse that was in your
hand earlier that was coming from the gun? It

716
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:24,420
pulses like a heartbeat in the hand that was
holding it, and for a second you feel like

717
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:31,422
something grabbed your wrist and slapped it away
towards your back, reaching for

718
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:33,146
where Bad News is.

719
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:34,295
TALIESIN: Which does work.

720
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:38,119
MATT: And then you (grunts) rip control of your
hand once again.

721
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:48,943
TALIESIN: Delilah. You are going to die tonight.
Whether or not it is a merciful, quick death or a

722
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:55,642
slow and agonizing one, controlled by something
darker than I know, is entirely up to you. How do

723
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:58,355
we stop that thing?!

724
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,979
MATT: Delilah, whose eyes are still rolling after
all the shouting that's been going on as she comes

725
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:11,260
into consciousness with a gag around her mouth and
goes (breathes heavily, struggling) And her eyes

726
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,393
dart around in fear. You can see that her makeup
has run down her cheeks from her own lamenting

727
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:22,470
over Sylas's loss and the confusion over the
ritual. And the fear all of a sudden turns to

728
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:27,257
seething, burning hatred as they dart around. And
then (struggles again). She can't talk.

729
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:30,262
SAM: I will Mage Hand to remove the gag from her.

730
00:46:30,262 --> 00:46:32,447
LAURA: Oh god! I pull an arrow and aim it right at
her head.

731
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,583
MARISHA: Yeah, I prep my fire hands.

732
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:41,360
TALIESIN: I know the pain you're feeling right
now. I know the rage. I know every moment of it,

733
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:51,480
and I guarantee I can make it worse. I can make it
so much worse. Fix this. And join your beloved.

734
00:46:51,480 --> 00:47:05,862
MATT: As this is happening, the gag falls away
from her mouth from the magic hand. She's glancing

735
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:09,986
at you and the smoke is now billowing up stronger
to the point where you can barely see Percy's

736
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:15,833
torso. You can see his head now, and what little
bit of a view you have, his eyes have gone

737
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:21,565
completely dark. There is just pitch black,
completely encasing the entirety of his visible

738
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:26,143
eye. You can see his feet still dangling beneath
the smoke, and his feet are digging and tensed

739
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,424
into the ground.

740
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:29,542
TALIESIN: Delilah, don't make me hurt you.

741
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:37,903
MARISHA: I reach over and I grab Vex's hand. And I
look at her and I say, what do we do?

742
00:47:37,903 --> 00:47:39,897
TALIESIN: Grog, be ready to restrain me.

743
00:47:39,897 --> 00:47:41,212
TRAVIS: I'm ready!

744
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:48,428
LAURA: Percival Frederickstein von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III, you will fight this

745
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:50,198
monster inside of you!

746
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:56,354
MATT: Delilah is looking at you right now and the
anger and fury in her eyes clarified, she just

747
00:47:56,354 --> 00:48:00,179
looks up and, "You've already taken everything
from me."

748
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:06,970
TALIESIN: I really haven't. You still have your
sanity and your life. I will take your life

749
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,885
tonight, but I can leave you your sanity.

750
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:16,616
MATT: "Interesting. You seem to be struggling,
Percy."

751
00:48:16,616 --> 00:48:25,947
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to be an asshole. Fine.
Fine. Casting Minor Illusion.

752
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:26,983
MATT: Okay.

753
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:33,288
TALIESIN: I'm changing my form into the screaming,
writhing, slowly-melting visage of Lord

754
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:34,451
Briarwood.

755
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:36,048
LAURA: Oh shit!

756
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:41,075
TALIESIN: And I'm just going to scream in holy
high hell and pain.

757
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:42,413
MATT: Okay.

758
00:48:42,413 --> 00:48:45,514
TALIESIN: Suck it, girl!

759
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:49,180
MATT: So Minor Illusion, as a limitation, it
wouldn't be a full-body illusion, but you can take

760
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,671
elements of your features.

761
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,049
TALIESIN: I'm in smoke. I'm just taking--

762
00:48:52,049 --> 00:49:00,488
MATT: Yeah. Where once Percy's face existed, it
twists into this shimmering apparition of Sylas

763
00:49:00,488 --> 00:49:06,908
Briarwood looking down at her as his face contorts
into horrible, screaming pain. The head rises up

764
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:12,688
and almost soundlessly, he screams out as the
flesh begins to melt from the bone. As it does,

765
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:16,935
Percy's voice rings out in this cacophonous roar
that shakes the cavern around you.

766
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:22,642
TALIESIN: That pain you're feeling, I've felt for
years. Don't think I've imagined every way to hurt

767
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:36,055
you! I could spend years hurting you before you
die, in ways you cannot imagine. Now, how do we

768
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:40,873
stop it?

769
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:46,874
MATT: "I don't know. I don't even know if it
worked. We've been preparing for this ritual

770
00:49:46,874 --> 00:50:01,245
"for... five godforsaken years. All to repay a
debt. And that's all. You forced us.

771
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:03,482
"It was too soon."

772
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:08,475
TALIESIN: Why? Why was it too soon? What were you
waiting for?

773
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:19,736
MATT: "We were waiting for a particular date.
There is a time each year in which the barriers

774
00:50:19,736 --> 00:50:34,429
"between realms grow and grow very weak. You recall
Erevan's attempt generations ago to blur between

775
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:48,208
"the realm of ice and this one, which you call the
Winter's Crest. Well, this is too early, and you

776
00:50:48,208 --> 00:51:04,434
"saw our failure. He will not be happy, I imagine.
And I still owe him for what he gave me. For what

777
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:06,039
"he gave us."

778
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,810
LAURA: What did he give you?

779
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:27,508
MATT: At which point, her eyes well up with tears,
and she looks over. "He gave me my Sylas back. And

780
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:45,475
"you took him from me again. So do what you must
do. I know I've paid my penance, and I know that

781
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:49,684
"no matter what steps you take now, it will only
drag you deeper into this dark hole you've drawn

782
00:51:49,684 --> 00:51:52,908
"yourselves. And you will hear me laughing."

783
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:58,008
TALIESIN: No, I really won't. Knock her out
again.

784
00:51:58,008 --> 00:52:01,324
TRAVIS: Oh. Fine! (punching sound)

785
00:52:01,324 --> 00:52:02,600
MATT: Make a strength check.

786
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,689
TRAVIS: 19.

787
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:14,119
MATT: 19? (impact noise) You hear (clinking)
across some of the lower rocks as two of her teeth

788
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:16,428
go scattering out the side of her mouth.

789
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:17,692
TALIESIN: Collect them.

790
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:21,484
TRAVIS: They're not pointy, right?

791
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:22,372
MATT: No.

792
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,282
TALIESIN: Check her person for anything.

793
00:52:24,282 --> 00:52:28,474
LAURA: Oh, I will gladly do that for you.

794
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:30,988
TRAVIS: Hold on a second. Are you sure you don't
want to smoke this bitch?

795
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,640
LAURA: I check her person for anything valuable.

796
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,386
TALIESIN: I think we're just going to throw her
into the acid pits.

797
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:40,750
No, I don't feel...

798
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,237
LIAM: What's the plan here, Percy?

799
00:52:45,237 --> 00:52:49,852
SAM: I pick up the Pepperbox off the floor to give
it to him, and I try to sneak out a bullet.

800
00:52:49,852 --> 00:52:51,702
TALIESIN: They're different bullets.

801
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,261
SAM: I don't know that!

802
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:55,854
MATT: Okay. Make a sleight of hand check.

803
00:52:55,854 --> 00:52:57,869
SAM: Three!

804
00:52:57,869 --> 00:52:58,824
TRAVIS: Shit!

805
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:01,370
SAM: Plus two! Plus two.

806
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,510
MATT: So five. (giggles)

807
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:07,275
TALIESIN: The three, in theory, is actually low
enough to break it further.

808
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:08,508
MATT: Make a perception check.

809
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:11,019
MARISHA: Plus two, it's five.

810
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:12,308
TALIESIN: Fine.

811
00:53:12,308 --> 00:53:13,574
LIAM: Natural one.

812
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:15,451
TALIESIN: Nope. That's a 16.

813
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:24,688
MATT: So you watch as Scanlan looks around, grabs
it. Picks it up and (clink) the full barrel comes

814
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:26,331
off of the gun.

815
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:29,022
SAM: I back away from it.

816
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:32,662
LAURA: You guys, he's got smoke billowing out of
him right now.

817
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:36,324
SAM: Kick it off away to the corner.

818
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:40,030
TALIESIN: Scanlan. Give me the other gun.

819
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,856
SAM: Oh, it's on the floor right there.

820
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:45,489
TALIESIN: The other gun.

821
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:52,218
SAM: You were talking to something out there. What
was it? I was very scared. I'm a little man!

822
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:54,005
TRAVIS: Just change the subject.

823
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:56,213
SAM: Who were you talking to?

824
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,551
TALIESIN: I need another gun.

825
00:53:57,551 --> 00:54:01,175
SAM: Are you going to kill me with it?

826
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:03,921
(laughter)

827
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:05,665
TALIESIN: Maybe?

828
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:09,862
LIAM: I walk between them and say, Percy, what
are we doing here? That woman deserves everything

829
00:54:09,862 --> 00:54:15,663
that is brought upon her, but what are we doing
for Whitestone? What are we doing?

830
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:20,793
MARISHA: More importantly, what was that just
now?! Who were you talking to?

831
00:54:20,793 --> 00:54:21,850
TALIESIN: I don't know.

832
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,248
MARISHA: What?!

833
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:24,918
TALIESIN: Things have gotten a bit weird.

834
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:30,705
MARISHA: Percy, you cannot honestly tell us you
don't know anymore! We just watched you have a

835
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:33,017
full-fledged conversation with yourself!

836
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:35,386
TALIESIN: Did they not hear any of the voice?

837
00:54:35,386 --> 00:54:37,481
LIAM: Yeah, was he talking out loud?

838
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:40,187
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I came off like a crazy person
just then!

839
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:42,323
TRAVIS: You did! Yes, you did.

840
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:44,260
SAM: Here's what I know.

841
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,221
TRAVIS: We were trying to answer you for a little
bit.

842
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:52,390
SAM: Here's what I know. Vecna is possibly, maybe
on the loose, maybe coming back. We know that this

843
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,803
ritual has been started, and we don't know whether
killing her is going to end it or not. So I

844
00:54:56,803 --> 00:54:58,990
propose that we start leaving right away.

845
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:01,485
LAURA: Pike, do you know anything about Vecna?

846
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:03,635
MARISHA: Anything further?

847
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:10,412
MATT: Pike, you go ahead and make a religion
check.

848
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:12,667
SAM: Matt, fly to New York to whisper in her ear.

849
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,871
(laughter)

850
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:15,208
MATT: It's tempting.

851
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,450
MARISHA: Yeah, just text her!

852
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,179
LIAM: 47!

853
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:20,353
ASHLEY: 17.

854
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:27,009
MATT: 17, okay. Not a whole lot more information
than what Scanlan was able to ascertain from

855
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:32,579
this. You just know that this entity known as
Vecna, once a very powerful arch-lich, had once

856
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:40,096
attempted to ascend to godhood, and was supposedly
halted in the process, a battle that occurred on

857
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:47,342
another plane, amongst heroes that only a few came
back from, but apparently stopped a very terrible

858
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:52,044
thing. But that was hundreds and hundreds of years
ago.

859
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:55,154
MARISHA: I wonder what Erevan has to do with
this.

860
00:55:55,154 --> 00:55:58,878
LAURA: And he created a vampire? He made Sylas a
vampire?

861
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,160
MATT: You do know that-- sorry.

862
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,171
MARISHA: Go ahead.

863
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:11,560
MATT: You do know, and Pike relays this too. In
particular, Vecna is known as, for lack of a

864
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:22,106
better term, the patron saint-- or lesser god to
those who worship-- as the deity of secrets. Dark

865
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:30,629
secrets, things that wish to be kept out of the
knowledge of most of the world at large. And

866
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:33,518
these secrets are coveted.

867
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,237
ASHLEY: Jeez.

868
00:56:35,237 --> 00:56:44,554
TALIESIN: Things are complex, and I don't trust
myself to take her life. I'm in over my head.

869
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:46,472
LAURA: Do you need someone else to do it for you?

870
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:48,614
TALIESIN: I don't know if that will help.

871
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:53,318
TRAVIS: She almost killed Vex, she didn't kill
Vax, we've got to do fucking something with her.

872
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:56,821
TALIESIN: This thing wants her dead, and the only
thing I can think to do is to say no.

873
00:56:56,821 --> 00:56:59,988
LIAM: This thing? What thing?

874
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,836
TALIESIN: This thing in my head--

875
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,296
LAURA: Your thing?!

876
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,366
LIAM: What thing is that, Percival?

877
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:06,525
TALIESIN: I don't know!

878
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:11,152
LIAM: Well, start fucking talking, Percival,
because we've all watched you talk to yourself for

879
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:14,473
five straight minutes, and we're not going to deal
with it for much longer!

880
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,515
MARISHA: Sorry, Percy. I'm with Vax, here.

881
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:20,123
TALIESIN: I had a dream, and that was all.

882
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:27,248
MARISHA: You mentioned just now that you wanted
your money back. Was this a dream? Did you pay

883
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:30,785
somebody? And with what?

884
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:38,873
TALIESIN: It was a dream where I was offered a
means to revenge. It was a dream!

885
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:41,288
MARISHA: Well, clearly it wasn't!

886
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:42,937
TALIESIN: Well, I know that now.

887
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:44,144
LIAM: Percival.

888
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:46,300
TALIESIN: This is as new to me as anyone.

889
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,104
LIAM: It feels like you are lying to us.

890
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:50,827
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

891
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:51,878
TALIESIN: Please.

892
00:57:51,878 --> 00:57:54,706
LAURA: (laughs) "Let me know if I'm lying,
because--"

893
00:57:54,706 --> 00:57:56,864
MARISHA: Fucking fuck!

894
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:59,016
TALIESIN: Why do you all keep rolling so poorly
against me?

895
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:00,711
MARISHA: 16.

896
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:10,054
MATT: Taliesin, tell me what your persuasion and
deception skills are.

897
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:12,448
TALIESIN: Persuasion six, deception two.

898
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:18,921
LAURA: 23! Ooh! Two in one!

899
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:20,445
TRAVIS: You got a whisper?!

900
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:23,244
MATT: Inter-party insight.

901
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:26,146
MARISHA: We have to title this "Whispers!"

902
00:58:26,146 --> 00:58:27,518
TRAVIS: Whispers!

903
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:29,900
TALIESIN: I think we've already had an episode
called "Whispers."

904
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,799
SAM: Well, this one's called "Secrets and Lies!"

905
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:35,324
LIAM: This one's called "Whisper-Sync."

906
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:37,275
TALIESIN: "Ear-tonguing."

907
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:39,773
SAM: This one's called just (whisper noises).

908
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:43,834
TRAVIS: For the record, I like the shadow stuff.

909
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:45,538
MARISHA: (squeals) I get one, too!

910
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:47,611
SAM: He whispers to you all the time.

911
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:53,282
(laughter)

912
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:55,935
LAURA: It looks like there was more tongue with
you, though, Sam.

913
00:58:55,935 --> 00:58:57,806
MATT: Way to point that out.

914
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,734
TRAVIS: Didn't get sufficient tongue in yours?

915
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:09,368
TALIESIN: You don't seem very satisfied.

916
00:59:09,368 --> 00:59:13,506
SAM: Remember, these shirts are available online
at geekandsundry.com!

917
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:16,726
LAURA: I knew you were going to do that. I almost
did it when he was whispering in your ear, just

918
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:17,801
for your sake!

919
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:24,985
MATT: I would also like you to make another
wisdom saving throw.

920
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:28,861
SAM: Oh shit.

921
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:29,982
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

922
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:31,971
TRAVIS: (yelling) Shut the fuck up!

923
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:34,101
TALIESIN: Breaking the game!

924
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,850
TRAVIS: What the-- what?!

925
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:46,700
MATT: At this point, you feel your hands tense up,
and once again begin to reach towards your back. You

926
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:54,019
close your eyes and with all your will and might,
you just scream "No!" Instinctively, it wasn't

927
00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:58,849
even a conscious thought, it was just an
animalistic response to feeling your physical form

928
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:03,417
being taken over, and in that moment, every muscle
in your body tenses.

929
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:09,929
And you guys watch the smoke momentarily drift
from his form behind him.

930
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:11,599
LAURA: Behind him?

931
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,274
TRAVIS: Off of him.

932
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:18,489
SAM: You don't need to yell at us, Percy. We're
just trying to help you.

933
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,121
TRAVIS: The smoke dissipates or goes behind him?

934
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,619
SAM: I don't think he's rational.

935
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,899
MATT: Behind him.

936
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:28,308
LIAM: I'm aiming at the smoke and just watching
and waiting.

937
01:00:28,437 --> 01:00:39,157
MATT: At this point, you can see this smoke that
was once billowing from Percy is now standing in

938
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:41,345
this outer human-like shape.

939
01:00:41,345 --> 01:00:43,789
SAM: Unbeam-say!

940
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:48,054
MARISHA: Cashed out-say.

941
01:00:48,054 --> 01:00:54,574
MATT: As it stands there for a moment, it begins
to swell and grow larger, filling almost the

942
01:00:54,574 --> 01:01:00,560
height of the ten-foot tunnel that you guys are
standing in, looming over Percy's body, still

943
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:06,461
connected through his shadow through the floor of
the tunnel itself. It just looms over and as it

944
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:11,223
peeks forward, you guys for the first time hear
the voice that's been poking through him this

945
01:01:11,223 --> 01:01:16,944
entire time just say, "Percival. Do it."

946
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:18,845
LAURA: I shoot a holy arrow at it.

947
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:20,241
MATT: Then let's roll some initiative.

948
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,542
(yelling)

949
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:27,262
MARISHA: We're fighting the thing that's been in
your head!

950
01:01:27,262 --> 01:01:29,121
TALIESIN: Therapy!

951
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:30,276
MARISHA: There's so many allegories!

952
01:01:30,276 --> 01:01:31,329
TALIESIN: Therapy!

953
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:33,797
MARISHA: We're fighting the demons in your head.

954
01:01:33,797 --> 01:01:37,350
MATT: (laughs) That's pretty great, actually.

955
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,979
TALIESIN: My therapist would be so proud right
now.

956
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:47,894
LAURA: Oh man, we're out of like everything,
aren't we?

957
01:01:47,894 --> 01:01:48,792
LIAM: Yes.

958
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,270
TRAVIS: Oh, we're great, we're fine, we're good.

959
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,741
SAM: We got a guy with a hammer. We're fine.

960
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:57,636
LAURA: Oh jeez, okay. Well, I've still got two
3rd-level spells.

961
01:01:57,636 --> 01:02:00,933
TALIESIN: I need stats on Lord Briarwood's sword.

962
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:04,284
MATT: You haven't taken a short rest.

963
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:07,167
SAM: You know what we have? We have fucking Pike.

964
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:08,262
LAURA: We have Pike!

965
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:10,082
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do! We've got Pike!

966
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:14,178
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm pretty low on spells, guys, but
we're going to be okay.

967
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:19,827
TALIESIN: I have been dreading this for years.

968
01:02:19,827 --> 01:02:21,418
LIAM: What? What have you been dreading?

969
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:22,884
TALIESIN: This moment right now.

970
01:02:22,884 --> 01:02:26,621
LAURA: Oh my god, this has been in him for three
years, four years.

971
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:29,237
MARISHA: Forever! Since the beginning.

972
01:02:29,237 --> 01:02:31,835
TALIESIN: Since you've met me.

973
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,223
TRAVIS: I've been standing in front of Lady
Briarwood.

974
01:02:34,223 --> 01:02:35,801
MATT: Yeah. So right there with her.

975
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:43,034
TALIESIN: I'm either going to be a new Percy or a
new person entirely.

976
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:44,383
LAURA: No, don't say that.

977
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:47,314
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. It's so fun to torture
you.

978
01:02:47,314 --> 01:02:54,171
SAM: As everyone's drawing their weapons, I shout,
maybe we should check and make sure it won't kill

979
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,253
him if we kill it.

980
01:02:56,253 --> 01:02:57,745
LAURA: It's too late. I shot an arrow at it!

981
01:02:57,745 --> 01:03:00,425
MATT: It's too late. Who's standing where? I'm
going to say Pike's probably--

982
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:02,930
TALIESIN: You have a little cavern for this!

983
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,021
LIAM: Where's Percy?

984
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:10,267
MATT: Percy is currently right here. Well, more in
the center there talking to everybody.

985
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:17,036
TALIESIN: Do you have a mini for the dark
specter of my soul? I love you!

986
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:18,905
I love you so much!

987
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:22,257
MATT: With Cassandra on the ground there.

988
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,310
LIAM: I'm next to Vex.

989
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:30,288
MATT: Right, so you guys would be probably back
here. Your daggers ready. Trinket is probably over

990
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:31,366
by you, of course.

991
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:32,355
LAURA: Yeah, of course he is.

992
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:35,060
MATT: And Keyleth? I'd say you're probably on this
side, talking to Percy.

993
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:39,212
LAURA: Oh wait, but we were holding hands at one
point, so we would be close.

994
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:44,332
TALIESIN: And Grog was covering me, so Grog
would've been closer to me, because I had him--

995
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:47,096
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was in front of Lady Briarwood,
though.

996
01:03:47,096 --> 01:03:49,273
MATT: I have you right here between him and Lady
Briarwood. Right there.

997
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:50,570
LAURA: That seems good, we're good.

998
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:55,842
LIAM: Do I have a clear shot, not that I'm going
to do it, but I was aiming at Percy, so I would

999
01:03:55,842 --> 01:03:57,759
have a clear line of sight. Is there nothing
between us?

1000
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:01,669
MATT: You would have a clear line of sight. The
two gnomes are between you, so you're fine.

1001
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:03,668
TALIESIN: I am so happy right now.

1002
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:05,009
LAURA: How did my holy arrow do?

1003
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:11,368
MATT: We're going to find out in just a second.
So, first and foremost, initiative order. We have

1004
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:13,661
25 to 20?

1005
01:04:13,661 --> 01:04:14,928
LAURA: 25.

1006
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:18,194
MATT: Wow, okay, so we have Vex.

1007
01:04:18,194 --> 01:04:19,099
SAM: 20.

1008
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:26,178
MATT: Two 20s. 19 to 15?

1009
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:27,453
LIAM: 19.

1010
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:28,428
MATT: 19.

1011
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:29,404
MARISHA: 16.

1012
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,629
MATT: 16, okay.

1013
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:32,275
MARISHA: I didn't suck it up this game.

1014
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:36,321
MATT: 15 to ten?

1015
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:37,594
TRAVIS: 17.

1016
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,336
MATT: 17. Oh, 17, all right.

1017
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:40,874
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, did I miss that section?

1018
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:43,116
MATT: You did. That's okay. Pike, what did you
get?

1019
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:44,168
ASHLEY: Eight!

1020
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:51,557
MATT: Eight! Yeah! All right. First and foremost,
Vex, you're up with the initiative on this. You go

1021
01:04:51,557 --> 01:04:53,469
ahead and you bring your holy arrow and you
release it.

1022
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:54,692
LAURA: Is it a surprise attack?

1023
01:04:54,692 --> 01:04:59,961
MATT: Technically, no, it knew you were there, it
was very aware of everyone's position. And was

1024
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:03,355
essentially after being forced out of his body at
the moment preparing itself for some sort of

1025
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:07,218
assault, so not a surprise round, unfortunately.
So go ahead and make your attacks with your

1026
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:11,582
arrows, if you'd like.

1027
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:15,071
LAURA: Yes! 28 and 27.

1028
01:05:15,071 --> 01:05:16,741
MATT: Both of those hit.

1029
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:29,710
LAURA: Awesome. Okay. These two... balls. So 15,
16, 17, plus holy damage?

1030
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:39,693
MATT: I'll consider that, do 1d4 radiant damage to
it. In addition to that, so 17 plus--

1031
01:05:39,693 --> 01:05:41,702
LAURA: 17 plus four is 21.

1032
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:43,000
MATT: 21 for the first one.

1033
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,540
LAURA: And then ten for the second.

1034
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,021
MATT: All right. So--

1035
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:49,956
LAURA: And then I Hunter's Mark him.

1036
01:05:49,956 --> 01:05:51,046
MATT: All righty.

1037
01:05:51,046 --> 01:05:58,446
LAURA: I didn't say I Hunter's Marked him at the
beginning-- I'm explaining this to you guys,

1038
01:05:58,446 --> 01:06:00,441
because I'd already said I shot at him.

1039
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:01,415
MATT: You did.

1040
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:05,831
LAURA: So I was being honest. I'm looking at the
chat room, because I know they're going to tell me

1041
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,248
I forgot my damn Hunter's Mark.

1042
01:06:07,248 --> 01:06:12,631
MATT: That's okay. All right. You pull back and
release the first arrow. As it goes and hits, you

1043
01:06:12,631 --> 01:06:16,000
can see the smoke itself is obscuring its place
and keeping it hard to hit, but you still strike

1044
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,563
true, the arrow striking into its form. And
there's a flash of radiant energy as it hits, and

1045
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:25,250
you see the creature takes from the impact and
stares down at its chest. As it looks up, its face

1046
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:31,036
turning towards you, and it is this formless
humanoid body, but the face itself does pinch into

1047
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:34,822
this elongated crow skull--

1048
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:36,763
LAURA: Ooh, I didn't do holy damage for the second
one!

1049
01:06:36,763 --> 01:06:39,281
SAM: Did the arrows hit?

1050
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:41,865
LAURA: Yeah. Plus two more for the holy damage.

1051
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:42,971
SAM: They impacted?

1052
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,537
MATT: They impacted.

1053
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:46,550
SAM: Okay.

1054
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:56,082
MATT: All right. Takes both the hits and looks
over at you, and you can see as it turns the head,

1055
01:06:56,082 --> 01:07:00,533
you can see better, even in this low light, the
shape of its face, and its eyes burst into this

1056
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:06,961
angry burning purplish energy expression and it
looks very unhappy with the current circumstance.

1057
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:09,190
Do you want to move you or Trinket?

1058
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:18,641
LAURA: Trinket moves around and in front of me to
protect me.

1059
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:22,766
MATT: Okay. There you go. That's it, you're just
going to keep there?

1060
01:07:22,766 --> 01:07:23,710
LAURA: Yeah.

1061
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,795
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up next.

1062
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:27,182
SAM: How tall is the tunnel?

1063
01:07:27,182 --> 01:07:29,796
MATT: It's about 12 feet.

1064
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:43,351
SAM: Okay. No? Okay. Precious little I can do. I
will Lightning Bolt it. Ooh,

1065
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,724
I'm right next to it.

1066
01:07:44,724 --> 01:07:47,649
MATT: You are, which means you could blast towards
the wall and hit it.

1067
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:51,989
SAM: All right. I will turn around and I will, I
will Lightning Bolt it, yes.

1068
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:56,553
MATT: Okay. All right. So you, it's right there in
front of you as the smoke rises up, and you see

1069
01:07:56,553 --> 01:07:59,883
the arrows strike it, there's the flash of holy
energy from Vex's attack, and that moment, as it's

1070
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:03,401
distracted, you use that to conjure a lightning
bolt and (lightning sound). For a moment, the

1071
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:07,846
flashing of light lights up the cavern around. The
bolt passes through it harmlessly.

1072
01:08:07,846 --> 01:08:10,247
MARISHA: What? What did you, what was that?

1073
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:11,234
SAM: Lightning.

1074
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:15,120
LAURA: Either or magic. One of the two didn't
affect it.

1075
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,811
MATT: The lightning bolt passes through it and it
strikes the back of the wall and you can see the

1076
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:24,982
electrical energy discharge across the stone and
earth, arcing and spidering off until it

1077
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:31,024
dissipates, seeming to not have any sort of impact
or effect on the billowing smoke entity.

1078
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,757
SAM: Shit.

1079
01:08:32,757 --> 01:08:37,302
MATT: You want to stay there or you want to move?
You are in its melee range. You are in its melee

1080
01:08:37,302 --> 01:08:39,745
range, so if you move it will get an attack of
opportunity if it chooses to take it.

1081
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:55,066
SAM: (stammers) I will not move and instead I will
inspire Percy.

1082
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:56,241
MATT: Okay.

1083
01:08:56,241 --> 01:09:00,881
SAM: And I'll say, you feel good in this
motherfucker! Your whole hood in this

1084
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:02,553
motherfucker! (laughs) That's it.

1085
01:09:02,553 --> 01:09:04,172
(laughter)

1086
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:09,461
MATT: All right, take your d10. This moment of
intensity, as you turn around now at this point,

1087
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:13,496
seeing everyone striking, you've looked your head
over and you can see for the first time in full

1088
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:20,191
physical form, the creature that has haunted your
dreams for the past five years. While it is not

1089
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:23,606
present, you can feel it smile. It's your turn.

1090
01:09:23,606 --> 01:09:37,768
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to my sister.

1091
01:09:37,768 --> 01:09:39,206
MATT: Okay.

1092
01:09:39,206 --> 01:09:43,679
TALIESIN: And cut open her bonds.

1093
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,640
MATT: Okay, so you pull out the-- okay.

1094
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:54,590
TALIESIN: Take out my sword and cut open her
bonds. Get back! Run! And then, if I still have

1095
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,170
enough timing beyond that, I'd love to take a
swipe at it with my sword.

1096
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:03,490
MATT: Unfortunately, it's going to, to free her
entirely of her bonds and give her that, it's

1097
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,606
going to be your action.

1098
01:10:04,606 --> 01:10:08,505
TALIESIN: Okay. We haven't had a short rest, have
we?

1099
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:09,683
MATT, LAURA, and MARISHA: No.

1100
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:11,604
MATT: I know.

1101
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:13,608
MARISHA: We're not looking good.

1102
01:10:13,608 --> 01:10:19,453
MATT: All right. It is now Vax's turn.

1103
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:23,603
LIAM: Oh? Good. So I've got advantage because the
smoke demon hasn't gone yet, so dagger and a

1104
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:35,516
dagger. First one is, that's 29, and the second
one is a 24, so 29 and 24.

1105
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:38,839
MATT: What's giving you advantage on this? Because
he hasn't gone first in the first round? That is

1106
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:41,397
correct, yes. All right. So both of those hit.

1107
01:10:41,397 --> 01:10:46,494
LIAM: The first one is eight and the second one is
eight.

1108
01:10:46,494 --> 01:10:47,463
MATT: Okay.

1109
01:10:47,463 --> 01:10:49,924
LIAM: Keen dagger, life-stealing.

1110
01:10:49,924 --> 01:10:54,229
MATT: Right. Do you want to sneak attack with
this? Because in theory, it's in melee range with

1111
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:55,168
an ally.

1112
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,174
LIAM: Oh, with Percy.

1113
01:10:56,174 --> 01:10:57,423
MATT: With Percy and with Scanlan.

1114
01:10:57,423 --> 01:10:58,967
LIAM: Thanks, boss! Yeah.

1115
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:01,764
MATT: Don't rob yourself of what you do.

1116
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:05,490
TALIESIN: Matt's understanding that we are all
screwed.

1117
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:11,551
LIAM: Seven, eight, nine. It's hard to see over
there. 15 points of sneak attack damage. Yeah, I'm

1118
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,052
not used to the screen.

1119
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:18,649
MATT: We're working out the bugs. It's a process.
We're working on it. All right, cool. 15 points of

1120
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:23,776
sneak attack damage. So as you throw the two
daggers, plunging them both, both of them, their

1121
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:29,385
little aura of magical energy flashing as they
both impact the smoke form, seeming to sink slowly

1122
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:35,448
as they hit and then finding the edge of their
blades sunken into its torso. As it rears back.

1123
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:40,547
LIAM: Eight and eight and 15.

1124
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:41,648
MATT: Correct, all right.

1125
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:46,381
MARISHA: So the daggers did it.

1126
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:51,381
MATT: Cool. That, are you going to stay where you
are, Vax?

1127
01:11:51,381 --> 01:11:53,234
LIAM: Yeah, I am.

1128
01:11:53,234 --> 01:12:02,591
MATT: All right. Now it is the entity's turn. As
it rears and the daggers both vanish from its

1129
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:08,400
torso, returning to your belt side, it is glaring
down at you to its side, and it says, "Percival.

1130
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:15,120
"Don't make Orthax regret working with you."

1131
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,683
SAM: Orthax?

1132
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:18,128
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Orthax.

1133
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:21,645
SAM: I hired them to get rid of some termites in
my house, once.

1134
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:26,378
TALIESIN: Well that was really your mistake,
then.

1135
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:35,251
MATT: Shifting this way twice. Percy, you will get
an attack of opportunity with

1136
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:36,522
your rapier if you'd like.

1137
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:37,366
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

1138
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:38,400
MATT: All right.

1139
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,041
TRAVIS: You're using Briarwood's rapier?

1140
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,105
TALIESIN: No, I haven't. No short rest.

1141
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:42,987
TRAVIS: Right.

1142
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:48,119
TALIESIN: 25.

1143
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:50,153
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1144
01:12:50,153 --> 01:12:58,553
TALIESIN: Nine points.

1145
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:03,143
MATT: Nine points of damage. All right. Good to
know.

1146
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,916
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah.

1147
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:12,552
MATT: Now, on the rest of its turn. As it shifts
up, it doesn't walk or move, its form drifts along

1148
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:16,827
and the shadows meet it there, the smoke almost
appears at the spot where it intends to go and

1149
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:21,324
then it meets it in that moment. As it does, it
now stands between a bunch of you. Its eyes flare

1150
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:27,760
with dark purple, and you just hear this scream,
this screeching (scream) echo out from it, and as

1151
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,689
it does, all of you hold your ears for a second. I
need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. You

1152
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:33,603
have advantage.

1153
01:13:33,603 --> 01:13:35,835
LAURA: We have advantage?

1154
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:42,513
TALIESIN: 21.

1155
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:46,841
MARISHA: With the ten, 23.

1156
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:50,862
SAM: Natural 20. On the first roll.

1157
01:13:50,862 --> 01:13:51,949
LIAM: 16.

1158
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:52,955
LAURA: 22.

1159
01:13:52,955 --> 01:13:54,050
TRAVIS: 16.

1160
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,471
LAURA: 18 for Pike.

1161
01:13:55,471 --> 01:14:05,878
MATT: Okay. So. All of you guys hold your ears for
a second, and everyone that rolled higher than a

1162
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:10,856
17 takes six points of psychic damage.

1163
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:12,953
MARISHA: Psychic damage?

1164
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:18,551
MATT: Correct. You guys both take 13 points of
psychic damage.

1165
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:21,351
TALIESIN: 13 because he's evil.

1166
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:31,332
MATT: Both of you feel all of a sudden like your
brain fill with this urge to strike something,

1167
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:42,018
this overwhelming need to slash out at whatever's
near you. Both of you get a brief move. Grog,

1168
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:47,838
that's going to pull you this way, and Vax, it's
going to pull you this way.

1169
01:14:47,838 --> 01:14:48,891
LIAM: Right at each other.

1170
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:55,359
MATT: I need both of you guys to roll an attack
roll. As you rush up with your hammer, flames, and

1171
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,241
you swing it down towards Scanlan.

1172
01:14:57,241 --> 01:14:58,871
LAURA: Scanlan!

1173
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,554
TRAVIS: Don't dap me for hitting Scanlan!

1174
01:15:00,554 --> 01:15:04,869
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to try to
dodge out of the way.

1175
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:06,055
MATT: Okay, roll the attack.

1176
01:15:06,055 --> 01:15:11,348
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 19?

1177
01:15:11,348 --> 01:15:13,211
MATT: Okay, so 19.

1178
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:18,455
SAM: I'm going to say, you gonna fail that
attack, so you better sit your ass on back,

1179
01:15:18,482 --> 01:15:22,827
because I ain't no hollaback gnome, I ain't no
hollaback gnome.

1180
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:24,449
MATT: All right, roll a d10.

1181
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:31,896
SAM: d10. Three? So that, what does that do?

1182
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:33,868
MATT: All right, so Cutting Words, if I recall--

1183
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:36,030
SAM: It lowers his attack by three.

1184
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,257
MATT: Right, so that brings it from 19 to 16.
What's your armor class?

1185
01:15:38,257 --> 01:15:40,174
SAM: It's 17.

1186
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:46,855
MATT: With that, the bard's words ring true to
your mind, and for a second, you feel this new,

1187
01:15:46,855 --> 01:15:51,541
this not Grog-based rage, this outside forceful
rage that it confuses you, and as he says that,

1188
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,985
you're right! He is no hollaback gnome.

1189
01:15:53,985 --> 01:15:56,126
(laughter)

1190
01:15:56,126 --> 01:16:00,024
MATT: And you resist with the hammer, giving him
just enough time to step out of the way, and it

1191
01:16:00,024 --> 01:16:03,209
slams into the ground harmlessly, cracking the
stone at the base.

1192
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:05,872
TRAVIS: "You know what? You're right! He is no
hollaback gnome."

1193
01:16:05,872 --> 01:16:11,378
MATT: Vax, I'd like you to go ahead and make a
dagger strike against Pike.

1194
01:16:11,378 --> 01:16:13,194
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

1195
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:17,877
MATT: Rolled a 13. Pike, you look over your
shoulder as all of a sudden Vax appears behind you

1196
01:16:17,877 --> 01:16:23,898
and slams forward with the dagger. You whip around
with your shield and, with a large striking arc of

1197
01:16:23,898 --> 01:16:29,776
sparks deflect the blade blow across the dark air
of this interior tunnel, harmlessly. You take no

1198
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:30,920
damage.

1199
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,727
LAURA: Badass Pike!

1200
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:34,617
TALIESIN: She also ain't no hollaback gnome.

1201
01:16:34,617 --> 01:16:36,267
MARISHA: Ain't no hollaback gnome.

1202
01:16:36,267 --> 01:16:37,552
TALIESIN: Ain't no hollaback gnome.

1203
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:39,504
ASHLEY: Ain't no hollaback gnome!

1204
01:16:39,504 --> 01:16:50,051
MATT: And with that, you know what? It's going to
go ahead and do this. The entity then moves

1205
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:54,758
backwards. Pike and Scanlan-- oh, you already used
your reaction to do Cutting Words, so you don't

1206
01:16:54,758 --> 01:16:57,268
get that. Pike, go ahead and make a melee attack.

1207
01:16:57,268 --> 01:17:00,452
SAM: Damn it. That's a reaction?

1208
01:17:00,452 --> 01:17:02,641
ASHLEY: What do I roll for that, again?

1209
01:17:02,641 --> 01:17:03,916
MATT: One reaction per round.

1210
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,151
LAURA: Your d20.

1211
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,997
MATT: Just roll a d20, roll for your normal mace
attack.

1212
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,101
ASHLEY: 17?

1213
01:17:09,101 --> 01:17:13,994
MATT: 17, unfortunately, does not hit. It seems
like it should've, but the smoke is obscuring the

1214
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:17,663
vision around it, and where you swing, you do not
manage to get quite close enough to hit its body.

1215
01:17:17,663 --> 01:17:21,162
As it steps backward into the wall and out of
visual range.

1216
01:17:21,162 --> 01:17:22,044
MARISHA: What!

1217
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:23,526
LAURA: What?

1218
01:17:23,526 --> 01:17:24,852
SAM: Into the wall?

1219
01:17:24,852 --> 01:17:31,145
MATT: Into the wall. It just vanishes into the
side of the tunnel. That brings us to Grog.

1220
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:32,798
LIAM: The cloud went in the wall?

1221
01:17:32,798 --> 01:17:33,952
MATT: Yeah.

1222
01:17:33,952 --> 01:17:36,065
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

1223
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:37,232
MATT: Okay.

1224
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:44,240
TRAVIS: And move in front of the rest of the
group. I put my back to the rest of the group.

1225
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,028
MATT: Okay, so like right there?

1226
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:46,917
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1227
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:47,674
MATT: Okay.

1228
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:50,019
SAM: What the fuck, Grog, you just tried to kill
me!

1229
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,012
TRAVIS: I did?

1230
01:17:51,012 --> 01:17:52,042
SAM: Yes!

1231
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,215
TRAVIS: I don't remember that.

1232
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:54,086
SAM: Are you okay?

1233
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:54,969
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1234
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:57,348
MATT: If you want to, you can hold. You can use
your action to ready an attack so whenever a

1235
01:17:57,348 --> 01:18:00,512
trigger of your choosing happens, you can then
make your attack.

1236
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:01,704
TRAVIS: I would like to do that.

1237
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:03,275
MATT: Okay. What trigger would you like?

1238
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:05,784
TRAVIS: When he reappears.

1239
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:07,586
MATT: Okay, and comes within melee range?

1240
01:18:07,586 --> 01:18:09,987
TRAVIS: Yeah, when I can see him with my beautiful
eyes.

1241
01:18:09,987 --> 01:18:13,892
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your action there.
Good to know. Keyleth, you're up.

1242
01:18:13,892 --> 01:18:24,226
MARISHA: Okay. Not trusting this guy, I'm going to
go ahead and cast Faerie Fire. It's a 20-foot

1243
01:18:24,226 --> 01:18:27,309
radius. Just right in this bubble that we've been
hanging out in.

1244
01:18:27,309 --> 01:18:28,428
MATT: Okay.

1245
01:18:28,428 --> 01:18:30,707
MARISHA: Because I'm assuming he's going to be up
in our faces.

1246
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:37,638
MATT: All righty. Faerie Fire. Where do you want
it? Just in this vicinity?

1247
01:18:37,638 --> 01:18:40,034
MARISHA: Yeah, just right, right around us.

1248
01:18:40,034 --> 01:18:44,622
MATT: Okay, so, 20-foot radius so we'll say
probably in the back here and forward this way, so

1249
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:53,901
this area between these. So as Keyleth, you put
your arms up and this burst of glowing luminescent

1250
01:18:53,901 --> 01:19:01,013
pinkish-purple energy begins to sparkle through
the air like glitter suspended in low gravity, and

1251
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:04,845
it drifts through the air in the entire vicinity,
you can see it clinging to you guys a little bit.

1252
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:08,621
All right. Are you going to move or you going to
stay where you are?

1253
01:19:08,621 --> 01:19:10,215
MARISHA: I'll step back a bit.

1254
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:12,319
MATT: Step out of the Faerie Fire or into it?

1255
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:13,439
MARISHA: Step out of it.

1256
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:14,645
MATT: Okay. Am I?

1257
01:19:14,645 --> 01:19:15,901
MARISHA: That's good.

1258
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:19,156
MATT: Just ten feet? Okay. Ending your turn,
Keyleth. Pike, you're up.

1259
01:19:19,156 --> 01:19:24,718
ASHLEY: Okay. Is Guiding Bolt considered the same
thing that Lightning Bolt would be?

1260
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:28,251
MATT: No, as far as you know--

1261
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:29,654
LIAM: Radiant damage.

1262
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:34,927
MATT: Yeah, it's radiant damage and, let me pull
up the--

1263
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:36,669
TRAVIS: We can't see him right now, though.

1264
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:42,696
MATT: Yeah, you have no visual on him. The smoke
entity has moved into the wall and is nowhere in

1265
01:19:42,696 --> 01:19:46,982
your visible range right now, so you have nothing
that you can attack in theory that you know of.

1266
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,580
ASHLEY: Okay.

1267
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:56,546
MATT: If you have any buff spells, anything you
want to do in preparation for it, or hold your

1268
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:58,660
action as well until it reappears, you can do
that.

1269
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,148
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll hold my action.

1270
01:20:00,148 --> 01:20:01,158
MATT: Okay.

1271
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:02,110
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1272
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:04,949
MATT: Are you staying put? Are you moving at all,
or do you want to stay where you are?

1273
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:09,249
ASHLEY: I think I'll stay. I can't see where I'm
at, but I think I'll just stay.

1274
01:20:09,249 --> 01:20:10,330
MATT: Okay. Cool.

1275
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:15,619
SAM: I'm going to just call out to everybody, the
thing seems to want Percy.

1276
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:18,131
Should we surround him?

1277
01:20:18,131 --> 01:20:19,339
LIAM: Yes.

1278
01:20:19,339 --> 01:20:26,734
MATT: So you shout that out at the end of that?
Cassandra, now, who has been unbound, gets up. Her

1279
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:31,579
weapons were taken from her when you bound her, so
she stands up and puts herself to the wall and

1280
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:33,282
looks at you with a--

1281
01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:34,512
TALIESIN: I hand her my sword.

1282
01:20:34,512 --> 01:20:42,000
MATT: Okay. She takes the rapier and looks at it
and goes running away, back towards where Castle

1283
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,379
Whitestone is.

1284
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:44,608
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1285
01:20:44,608 --> 01:20:46,145
TRAVIS: She runs?

1286
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:50,459
ASHLEY: Can I do something?

1287
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:56,561
MATT: If you want to, instead of holding your
action, cast something, you can do that.

1288
01:20:56,561 --> 01:21:03,975
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to go up to Percy and cast
Protection from Evil on him.

1289
01:21:03,975 --> 01:21:06,045
TALIESIN: Whoa!

1290
01:21:06,045 --> 01:21:07,871
ASHLEY: Which...

1291
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:15,310
MATT: What are you going to choose? You get to
choose a certain type of creature which he's

1292
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,978
protected against.

1293
01:21:16,978 --> 01:21:18,964
TALIESIN: Do we know anything about Orthax?

1294
01:21:18,964 --> 01:21:27,020
MATT: You have no idea. You saw it briefly. I'm
going to have you roll a religion check. Being a

1295
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:33,851
religiously trained individual, let's see if you
can ascertain the nature of this creature, this

1296
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:35,706
entity.

1297
01:21:35,706 --> 01:21:39,430
ASHLEY: 22.

1298
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:45,527
MATT: 22? Okay. In the brief moment you got to see
it, the way it moves, the way it completely cast

1299
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:50,280
aside Scanlan's attack, and the way that it housed
itself within Percy for so long. There are

1300
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:55,451
elements of it that make you think of a shadow
demon. But usually, they're not this large.

1301
01:21:55,451 --> 01:22:02,287
They're not this powerful. Either this is just a
powerful entity of a similar type, or it's been

1302
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:07,687
feeding over time, or it's something beyond that,
but you get the sense that this thing is demonic

1303
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:10,717
in nature, based on the brief appearance you had
with it.

1304
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,470
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to protect him from shadow
demons.

1305
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,153
MATT: Okay, so that would be fiends. So you choose
fiends? Great. So any attack rolls against you

1306
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:21,394
from fiend creatures have disadvantage.

1307
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:22,504
LAURA: He's a demon?

1308
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,105
MATT: She's thinking he might be, based on her
roll.

1309
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:28,911
LAURA: I have favored enemy as demons.

1310
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:40,871
MATT: Then, knowing that going forward, that may
change your next round of combat. Good to know! So

1311
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:43,679
you are currently are protected from fiends.

1312
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,395
TALIESIN: If only that were true in real life.

1313
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,111
MATT: Vex, you're up first.

1314
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:53,284
LAURA: Oh. So demons are my favored enemy, so I
have advantage against recalling information about

1315
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:56,620
them. Can I recall anything about something that
looks like this?

1316
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,955
MARISHA: Orthax?

1317
01:22:57,955 --> 01:23:02,760
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Just roll a d20
and add your intelligence. And you have advantage

1318
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,962
on it because he's your favored.

1319
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:08,432
LAURA: I'm not that smart. 12.

1320
01:23:08,432 --> 01:23:18,250
MATT: 12? Okay. You know that these creatures are
incorporeal. They can generally shift in and out

1321
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:23,816
of solid matter as a way of moving and defending
itself. You know that they're difficult to fight

1322
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:29,951
in the dark. You also know that they, because of
their form, are generally resistant to a lot of

1323
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:36,678
types of elemental-type damage. And lighting and
cold: no effect whatsoever.

1324
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,020
LAURA: Got it.

1325
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:39,356
MATT: As well as poison.

1326
01:23:39,356 --> 01:23:40,658
LAURA: Good to know.

1327
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:42,699
MATT: That's as much as you can ascertain with
that roll.

1328
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:51,747
LAURA: Okay. All right, then I'm going to cast--
where is he? (shouting) He's in the fucking wall!

1329
01:23:51,747 --> 01:23:53,369
SAM: Just hit the whole wall.

1330
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:55,955
LAURA: Hunter's Mark. Can I sense anything about
where he is?

1331
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:59,402
MATT: Yeah, you can actually sense him. He's maybe
ten feet inside the wall.

1332
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:00,792
LAURA: So he's hiding?

1333
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:02,436
MATT: He's currently hiding in the wall, yeah.

1334
01:24:02,436 --> 01:24:07,280
LAURA: All right, then for my bonus action, I'm
going to hide, as well.

1335
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,192
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

1336
01:24:11,192 --> 01:24:12,335
LIAM: Advantage.

1337
01:24:12,335 --> 01:24:13,320
MATT: Yeah.

1338
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,563
LAURA: Really?!

1339
01:24:16,563 --> 01:24:20,808
LIAM: I didn't roll it. The cape had nothing to do
with your rolls.

1340
01:24:20,808 --> 01:24:22,931
MATT: What?

1341
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:24,122
LIAM: Three and a three.

1342
01:24:24,122 --> 01:24:26,012
LAURA: Well, hold on, let me add my stealth to
it.

1343
01:24:26,012 --> 01:24:27,004
SAM: That's a 33.

1344
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:28,192
LAURA: That's a 12.

1345
01:24:28,192 --> 01:24:32,451
MATT: Okay, good to know. So you (wind noise)
flatten yourself against the wall, best of your

1346
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:33,250
ability.

1347
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,152
LAURA: I do pretty much nothing. And I'm going to
hold my turn until he appears.

1348
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:37,522
MATT: Okay, so you're going to hold your action
until he appears.

1349
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:38,795
MARISHA: How dark is it in here?

1350
01:24:38,795 --> 01:24:41,254
MATT: Other than the torches you guys have been
carrying through here?

1351
01:24:41,254 --> 01:24:43,153
SAM: And the glowing off of our bodies.

1352
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:44,243
MATT: Yes.

1353
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:46,995
LAURA: Oh, right. I'm glowing. No wonder I rolled
so poorly.

1354
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:54,722
MATT: Glowing from the Faerie Fire. But it's a
gentle glow, so it's very low light in this area.

1355
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,589
TALIESIN: Like inside of Groot gentle glow.

1356
01:24:56,589 --> 01:24:57,766
MARISHA: It's like we have body glitter on.

1357
01:24:57,766 --> 01:24:58,864
LAURA: It's beautiful.

1358
01:24:58,864 --> 01:25:01,794
MATT: Yeah. It's like a nice basement bar. A good
dive.

1359
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:03,473
SAM: Get this shit off me!

1360
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:06,689
MATT: (laughs) Ending your turn. Scanlan, you're
up.

1361
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:15,877
SAM: I say to Keyleth, get this shit off me. I
don't want it to see me. Please. And then I will

1362
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:21,239
walk to the other side of Percy. We don't see the
thing, right?

1363
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:22,384
MATT: No.

1364
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:24,923
MARISHA: You can just move out of the Faerie Fire.
It's only a 20-foot radius.

1365
01:25:24,923 --> 01:25:26,352
SAM: No, but isn't it on me now?

1366
01:25:26,352 --> 01:25:30,875
MARISHA: No, it's a radius. If you move out of it,
you're not in it.

1367
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:31,912
SAM: I walk out of it.

1368
01:25:31,912 --> 01:25:35,833
MATT: All right. You step out of the area and it
all drifts off your body, and you're no longer

1369
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:36,924
affected by the spell.

1370
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:48,003
SAM: We don't see the thing, right? Yeah. There's
not much we can do without

1371
01:25:48,003 --> 01:25:49,420
seeing our enemy, right?

1372
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,047
MATT: Not currently, no.

1373
01:25:51,047 --> 01:25:54,824
SAM: I'll just hold my turn? Is that a thing? Can
I do that?

1374
01:25:54,824 --> 01:25:56,513
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1375
01:25:56,513 --> 01:26:01,193
SAM: I can say to Grog, Grog? You're sure you
want to-- are you okay? You're good?

1376
01:26:01,193 --> 01:26:02,225
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1377
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:03,395
SAM: All right.

1378
01:26:03,395 --> 01:26:06,530
MATT: All right. Ends your turn. Percy, you're
up.

1379
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,232
TALIESIN: I'm going to back out of the Faerie
Fire.

1380
01:26:08,232 --> 01:26:11,715
MATT: You're just stepping out of it there. You
can keep going if you want.

1381
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:16,895
TALIESIN: I'm going to go a little further back
behind Scanlan. And I'm going to pull out Bad News

1382
01:26:16,895 --> 01:26:18,557
and hold my turn.

1383
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:23,830
MATT: Okay. Ending your turn. Vax, you're up.

1384
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:28,349
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to practice an old trick
that my sister and I have done, where I hide

1385
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:35,395
behind Trinket's gigantic bear ass and hold my
turn and aim at the spot that

1386
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:36,755
my sister is aiming at.

1387
01:26:36,755 --> 01:26:38,335
MATT: All right, good to know.

1388
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:39,382
TALIESIN: Ditto.

1389
01:26:39,382 --> 01:26:49,787
MATT: All right. At that moment, as you vanish to
the side, the entity pops out from this side--

1390
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:53,236
LAURA: Right behind him?

1391
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:57,042
MATT: Right behind you as you're preparing. And
all of a sudden (whoosh) smoke billows out. You

1392
01:26:57,042 --> 01:26:59,703
turn out of the corner of your head. At that
point, everyone who was holding your action,

1393
01:26:59,703 --> 01:27:02,074
you're doing your attacks simultaneously.

1394
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:03,044
LAURA: Whoa.

1395
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:05,332
MARISHA: And he's in that Faerie Fire, right?

1396
01:27:05,332 --> 01:27:06,947
MATT: He is, currently, yeah.

1397
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:08,395
MARISHA: So you get advantage, yo.

1398
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:11,577
MATT: He didn't see it being cast. He withdrew
before it happened, so he steps right into it.

1399
01:27:11,577 --> 01:27:15,667
TALIESIN: All right, starting with Bad News with a
sharpshooter.

1400
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:19,127
LAURA: We get advantage on attacking him?

1401
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:21,161
MATT: Yeah, all of your attacks on him currently
have advantage.

1402
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:29,616
TALIESIN: Thank god, because I rolled a one. 14?

1403
01:27:29,616 --> 01:27:34,487
MATT: 14 unfortunately misses. You fire and
(ricochet noise) it seems that, in a strange way,

1404
01:27:34,487 --> 01:27:38,355
the gentle pink dust is actually obscuring your
vision with the dark shadow in that vicinity and

1405
01:27:38,355 --> 01:27:40,635
it blasts a piece of rock off the side of the
wall.

1406
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,105
TALIESIN: Firing again.

1407
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:43,281
MATT: So fire, reload.

1408
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:49,065
TALIESIN: Better! 26.

1409
01:27:49,065 --> 01:27:52,242
MATT: 26 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1410
01:27:52,242 --> 01:28:14,988
TALIESIN: That's... That's pizza! I'm looking for
my dice. I didn't think this through. 25 points of

1411
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,095
damage.

1412
01:28:16,095 --> 01:28:20,828
MATT: All right, good to know. This is piercing,
right?

1413
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:21,876
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1414
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:29,016
MATT: All right. The blast hits, but it appears
that the expected impact from the blast of Bad

1415
01:28:29,016 --> 01:28:35,791
News-- a bit of smoke dissipates its impact and it
seems to not be as damaging as you expected it to

1416
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:40,828
be. All right, that brings us to the next person
who was holding their action. I believe Scanlan,

1417
01:28:40,828 --> 01:28:43,462
you were? What do you want to do?

1418
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:53,219
SAM: There's precious little I can do, so I will
viciously mock it.

1419
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:55,440
(laughter)

1420
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,556
MATT: Good.

1421
01:28:56,556 --> 01:29:03,705
SAM: Through the Hand Cone, I will say, don't you
know smoking is the number one cause of cancer and

1422
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:11,284
emphysema and will shorten your life by an
estimated ten to 20 years? It's not cool, and you

1423
01:29:11,284 --> 01:29:12,836
shouldn't do it.

1424
01:29:12,836 --> 01:29:14,247
TALIESIN: Is that all true?

1425
01:29:14,247 --> 01:29:15,546
SAM: I'm BS-ing!

1426
01:29:15,546 --> 01:29:16,627
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

1427
01:29:16,627 --> 01:29:24,856
MATT: Okay. It does not make its saving throw; it
rolled a four, so it takes 3d4 psychic damage. Go

1428
01:29:24,856 --> 01:29:28,684
ahead and roll that. And it has disadvantage on
its next attack roll.

1429
01:29:28,684 --> 01:29:31,121
LIAM: That fiend has low self-esteem.

1430
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:32,712
SAM: Five points.

1431
01:29:32,712 --> 01:29:35,317
MATT: Five points of damage, boom.

1432
01:29:35,317 --> 01:29:36,762
SAM: And it has disadvantage on what?

1433
01:29:36,762 --> 01:29:43,188
MATT: On its next attack roll. Its eyes go darker
purple for a second, like it can't contemplate the

1434
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:49,815
fact that it just got insulted mid-battle, and
then they flare up again, even more furious. As

1435
01:29:49,815 --> 01:29:51,302
part of that, it's going to use its reaction.

1436
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:53,164
SAM: Oh shit. Okay.

1437
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:57,810
MATT: It turns towards you and in-- what languages
do you speak?

1438
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,944
SAM: Gnome, Common. That's it.

1439
01:30:00,944 --> 01:30:02,827
(laughter)

1440
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:08,755
MATT: You hear a muttering through your ears.
(mutters in foreign language) And for a second,

1441
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:12,586
you feel your field of vision close down like it's
focused entirely on you. You're currently marked

1442
01:30:12,586 --> 01:30:15,079
by its Mark of Vengeance.

1443
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:16,784
SAM: Marked?

1444
01:30:16,784 --> 01:30:21,871
MATT: Yeah. So, essentially, there's an effect
that's intent on you at the moment.

1445
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:23,318
SAM: Is it a charm effect?

1446
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:24,138
MATT: Nope.

1447
01:30:24,138 --> 01:30:25,131
SAM: Damn it.

1448
01:30:25,131 --> 01:30:27,458
MATT: All right, that ends your held actions.

1449
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:28,478
SAM: Is it a fear effect?

1450
01:30:28,478 --> 01:30:29,309
MATT: No.

1451
01:30:29,309 --> 01:30:30,170
SAM: Damn it!

1452
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:30,953
MATT: You're up.

1453
01:30:30,953 --> 01:30:33,454
LIAM: Yeah, I just saw him mutter in Scanlan's ear
as I take both of my blades and I'm just going to

1454
01:30:33,454 --> 01:30:37,880
slash both of them across and he's surrounded, so
this is a sneak attack, as well.

1455
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,745
MATT: Yes.

1456
01:30:38,745 --> 01:30:40,846
LIAM: With advantage. The first one...

1457
01:30:40,846 --> 01:30:42,694
LIAM and LAURA: (groan)

1458
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:47,990
LIAM: Is 16. Oh no! And the second one is a 27.

1459
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:49,280
MATT: Second one hits.

1460
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,408
LIAM: All right.

1461
01:30:50,408 --> 01:30:54,266
MATT: You go to strike the first time, and as you
swing outward, you catch smoke and it dissipates

1462
01:30:54,266 --> 01:30:56,972
around the blade and you stab into the side of the
wall.

1463
01:30:56,972 --> 01:30:57,939
LIAM: Okay.

1464
01:30:57,939 --> 01:30:59,263
MATT: Second attack (impact noise).

1465
01:30:59,263 --> 01:31:05,311
LIAM: Here comes that sneak attack damage. That's
four plus six is ten plus... sneak attack,

1466
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:11,908
motherfucker! Ten, 16, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29 total.

1467
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:13,096
LAURA: That was 38.

1468
01:31:13,096 --> 01:31:14,213
LIAM: Huh?

1469
01:31:14,213 --> 01:31:15,352
LAURA: Just kidding.

1470
01:31:15,352 --> 01:31:16,726
LIAM and LAURA: 29 total.

1471
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:18,502
LAURA: (singing) My math is awesome!

1472
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:24,572
MATT: Okay. This blade, however: as you stab into
this cloud of smoke, you feel there is more

1473
01:31:24,572 --> 01:31:31,382
physical presence to where it was and it sinks in
and you feel this reverberation as it reacts to

1474
01:31:31,382 --> 01:31:34,902
the pain. This dull (hoarse growl) growl sound.

1475
01:31:34,902 --> 01:31:37,325
LIAM: I shout, hands off the gnome! as I do it.

1476
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,483
MATT: Okay.

1477
01:31:38,483 --> 01:31:41,125
SAM: On my roll, do I still get a bonus?

1478
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:47,161
MATT: You used it last turn. That was his reaction
to you holding your action.

1479
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:50,642
SAM: No, but do I get my bonus action as part of
my move, or no?

1480
01:31:50,642 --> 01:31:54,409
MATT: That would have had to be during your turn.
When you hold your action, you just get the action

1481
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:55,415
when it triggers.

1482
01:31:55,415 --> 01:31:56,447
SAM: Got it.

1483
01:31:56,447 --> 01:32:00,760
MATT: All right, so that ends Vax. Do you want to
do anything else?

1484
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:14,857
LIAM: No. Oh, I'm right up against it? I'm going
to use disengage and back up further back by my

1485
01:32:14,857 --> 01:32:17,630
sister. Is that Vex and Keyleth?

1486
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:18,732
MATT: Right there, yeah.

1487
01:32:18,732 --> 01:32:20,339
LIAM: I'm going to move between my two favorite
ladies.

1488
01:32:20,339 --> 01:32:25,860
MATT: All right, there you go. Good to know. And
you were holding your action?

1489
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,996
LAURA: Yes.

1490
01:32:26,996 --> 01:32:28,118
MATT: And you were holding your action.

1491
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:28,877
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1492
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,005
MATT: So everyone make your attacks.

1493
01:32:30,005 --> 01:32:32,030
LAURA: Yes. Here's my question.

1494
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:32,979
MATT: Yes?

1495
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:39,393
LAURA: Because I want to be honest and I don't
remember if I said I dipped arrows in the second

1496
01:32:39,393 --> 01:32:43,330
holy oil flask or if I put them on Trinket's
claws. Do we remember?

1497
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,720
MATT: You did all arrows.

1498
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:48,276
LAURA: That's fine. Then I'm going to shoot two
more holy arrows at him.

1499
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:52,265
Okay, well, I'll roll for that.

1500
01:32:52,265 --> 01:32:55,055
MARISHA: With advantage!

1501
01:32:55,055 --> 01:33:04,443
LAURA: With advantage, which is good. I'm going to
switch things. New ones. (gasps) What just

1502
01:33:04,443 --> 01:33:05,414
happened?

1503
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:10,409
LIAM: Well, one of those was a 14, so that hit.
There's 14 and eight. 14 plus your attack. The

1504
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:12,143
second roll, she got a one and a two, so.

1505
01:33:12,143 --> 01:33:19,629
LAURA: Seriously?! So one was a 25. And then 17.

1506
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:20,906
MATT: 17 misses, unfortunately.

1507
01:33:20,906 --> 01:33:22,657
LAURA: I mean 19. 19 and a 25.

1508
01:33:22,657 --> 01:33:24,821
MATT: What's the 19 from?

1509
01:33:24,821 --> 01:33:27,297
LAURA: Was the first roll. And the second--

1510
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:28,756
MATT: Right, so you rolled a one and a two?

1511
01:33:28,756 --> 01:33:31,608
LIAM: No, that was the second roll. The first was
an eight and a 14, plus her modifiers.

1512
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:36,973
LAURA: Oh. See, I was rolling-- I understand. I
was rolling it in my head differently, but we'll

1513
01:33:36,973 --> 01:33:42,087
count it as that. I was counting it as that was my
first attempts at my first two attacks and my

1514
01:33:42,087 --> 01:33:43,975
second attempts at my first two attacks.

1515
01:33:43,975 --> 01:33:45,120
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

1516
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,213
LAURA: Yeah, okay, that's fine. So, 25.

1517
01:33:47,213 --> 01:33:50,182
MATT: Okay, so one of them hit. All right, so you
go ahead and roll damage on that.

1518
01:33:50,182 --> 01:33:59,801
LAURA: I won't roll like that anymore. Where am I?
That's radiant damage and that's that. Here we go.

1519
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,044
All right.

1520
01:34:01,044 --> 01:34:06,130
LIAM: Oh jeez, we've got a smoke demon, don'tcha
know?

1521
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:11,511
LAURA: 17 plus five is--

1522
01:34:11,511 --> 01:34:12,346
LIAM: 24.

1523
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:13,316
LAURA: 24 points.

1524
01:34:13,316 --> 01:34:17,933
MATT: 24 points of damage. So one of them flies
forward and misses--

1525
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:18,971
LAURA: 22.

1526
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:23,271
MATT: Yeah. Nearly grazes the top of your head,
just vanishing. You don't notice because you're

1527
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:28,073
currently (growls) right in his face. Second one
manages to strike it and splinter inside of its

1528
01:34:28,073 --> 01:34:34,806
torso, and you can see a flash of energy from the
impact and it (squawking groan, growl) surveys the

1529
01:34:34,806 --> 01:34:38,457
area around it. The smoke around it gets even more
intense, and you can see it flaring up.

1530
01:34:38,457 --> 01:34:40,134
LAURA: I'm still against the wall, glowing.

1531
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:43,403
MATT: Yeah, so the smoke gets even thicker and
obscures it even further.

1532
01:34:43,403 --> 01:34:50,895
LAURA: We should probably light up this area as
much as possible, FYI.

1533
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:52,251
MATT: And Grog?

1534
01:34:52,251 --> 01:34:56,609
TRAVIS: I'm going to light it up with my flaming
war hammer. I turn and I swing at it.

1535
01:34:56,609 --> 01:34:57,435
MATT: Okay.

1536
01:34:57,435 --> 01:35:00,252
MARISHA: So metal.

1537
01:35:00,252 --> 01:35:04,589
TRAVIS: Hey, that's good. 28?

1538
01:35:04,589 --> 01:35:07,147
MATT: 28 hits. Second attack.

1539
01:35:07,147 --> 01:35:08,955
TRAVIS: 26.

1540
01:35:08,955 --> 01:35:10,512
MATT: 26 hits.

1541
01:35:10,512 --> 01:35:13,315
TRAVIS: Nice. Oh, is it still covered in the holy
oil?

1542
01:35:13,315 --> 01:35:17,527
MATT: Yes, so an extra 1d4 radiant damage on each
strike.

1543
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:24,393
TRAVIS: 21 for the first one.

1544
01:35:24,393 --> 01:35:25,587
MATT: Okay.

1545
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,078
TRAVIS: With the radiant, fiery damage.

1546
01:35:28,078 --> 01:35:31,884
MATT: Burning, holy wrath.

1547
01:35:31,884 --> 01:35:35,891
TRAVIS: Fuck yes! 19, 20, 21. 22!

1548
01:35:35,891 --> 01:35:42,995
MATT: 22. All righty. (impact sounds) Both hammer
blows strike it, battering the smoke around, and

1549
01:35:42,995 --> 01:35:47,980
you can see as this hammer swings through its
body, the smoke almost swallows the light and for

1550
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:53,652
a second, it's almost like this dull orb of
darkness beneath the surface of a deep lake. And

1551
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:56,616
then as the hammer emerges from its body, the
light flares up again. It's almost like it's

1552
01:35:56,616 --> 01:36:02,130
swallowing the light as you strike it. But it
seems to be taking the impacts pretty hard. All

1553
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:06,214
right, that ends your turn. Now, Orthax can take
his turn.

1554
01:36:06,214 --> 01:36:07,068
LAURA: Oh no.

1555
01:36:07,068 --> 01:36:09,511
MATT: All right, so let's see.

1556
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:10,996
ASHLEY: Wait, do I get my--

1557
01:36:10,996 --> 01:36:14,301
MATT: That's right, you were holding, too. Yeah,
you can do it, too. Thank you for reminding me.

1558
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:15,443
LAURA: Yay, Pike!

1559
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:17,683
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Guiding Bolt it.

1560
01:36:17,683 --> 01:36:18,855
MATT: All right, go for it.

1561
01:36:18,855 --> 01:36:22,036
LIAM: Your punishment will be more severe.

1562
01:36:22,036 --> 01:36:24,570
(laughter)

1563
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,217
ASHLEY: All right, so 4d6--

1564
01:36:27,217 --> 01:36:29,970
MATT: What level of Guiding Bolt are you doing?

1565
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:32,020
ASHLEY: Say one more time?

1566
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,778
MATT: What level of Guiding Bolt are you casting?

1567
01:36:33,778 --> 01:36:40,322
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at 4th because I have a
couple of 4th-level left.

1568
01:36:40,322 --> 01:36:47,540
MATT: Okay, so that will be... (chuckles) Roll to
attack first. You have advantage on the attack

1569
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:51,222
roll because it's currently inside Faerie Fire, so
take the higher of the two rolls.

1570
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:56,204
LIAM: I would just like to say that Pike is very
eerie, yet beautiful in this iridescent glow of

1571
01:36:56,204 --> 01:37:00,185
astral projection. It's hard to hear her
sometimes, but god damn it,

1572
01:37:00,185 --> 01:37:01,663
she makes it look good.

1573
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:05,593
ASHLEY: Oh. Oh my god. I rolled a one and a
natural 20.

1574
01:37:05,593 --> 01:37:07,808
(cheering)

1575
01:37:07,808 --> 01:37:11,602
ASHLEY: What?

1576
01:37:11,602 --> 01:37:19,930
MATT: Okay. So at 4th level, that would be 7d6
radiant damage.

1577
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:21,556
LAURA and MARISHA: Whoa!

1578
01:37:21,556 --> 01:37:23,518
MARISHA: Wait, what did you cast?

1579
01:37:23,518 --> 01:37:25,077
LAURA and TRAVIS: Guiding Bolt.

1580
01:37:25,077 --> 01:37:26,389
MARISHA: Oh, fuck yeah!

1581
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:30,765
TALIESIN: 7d6?

1582
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:31,819
MATT: Yeah.

1583
01:37:31,819 --> 01:37:33,037
SAM: That's a lot of d6.

1584
01:37:33,037 --> 01:37:34,500
TALIESIN: Times two?

1585
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,262
LAURA: Is it times two after that because it's a
crit?

1586
01:37:36,262 --> 01:37:40,552
MARISHA: It's a crit? Oh, right, because that's--
well, it's straight dice rolls. Or does she roll

1587
01:37:40,552 --> 01:37:44,418
dice twice?

1588
01:37:44,418 --> 01:37:49,279
MATT: For the purpose of ease, I usually double.
I'm just confirming one thing real fast.

1589
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:52,555
LIAM: She has just blinded us all in holy light is
what I'm assuming.

1590
01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:54,205
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and do your math.

1591
01:37:54,205 --> 01:37:55,494
MARISHA: Little holy nuke.

1592
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:57,261
SAM: That's my Pike.

1593
01:37:57,261 --> 01:37:58,657
ASHLEY: Okay.

1594
01:37:58,657 --> 01:38:01,513
LAURA: What was it, Pike?

1595
01:38:01,513 --> 01:38:03,074
ASHLEY: 21.

1596
01:38:03,074 --> 01:38:04,297
LAURA: 21.

1597
01:38:04,297 --> 01:38:06,149
MATT: 21. All right.

1598
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:09,267
LAURA: Times two?

1599
01:38:09,267 --> 01:38:12,668
MARISHA: Times two, right?

1600
01:38:12,668 --> 01:38:13,680
LAURA: Please?

1601
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,608
MATT: Yep, so that would be times two. Just
confirming. It has been a while since we've had

1602
01:38:16,608 --> 01:38:21,798
any sort of spell-based crit. So that would be 42
points of radiant damage.

1603
01:38:21,798 --> 01:38:23,329
LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Whoa!

1604
01:38:23,329 --> 01:38:28,281
MATT: As you release this bolt of energy out of
your hand, you see it charges up and fills up your

1605
01:38:28,281 --> 01:38:33,448
hand, shaking, as you're waiting for the moment
where it might be too much to control, and your

1606
01:38:33,448 --> 01:38:45,359
holy symbol flares as it releases and streaks
forward, right behind you. You were technically in

1607
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:51,538
melee with it, which would have given you
disadvantage on the attack, but you had advantage

1608
01:38:51,538 --> 01:38:55,419
on him because of that and... we'll say it's fine.
It stays there because there were a lot of things

1609
01:38:55,419 --> 01:38:59,118
giving advantage against him and then
disadvantage. We'll stay with it. As you turn

1610
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:02,714
around, you release it. Point blank, it slams into
the front and you can see where the smoke was

1611
01:39:02,714 --> 01:39:06,719
swelling around it, it almost seems to be
scattered away from the impact of this radiant

1612
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:12,023
bolt, and for a second, this image of this
obscured, shadowy humanoid becomes very clear and

1613
01:39:12,023 --> 01:39:18,076
you can see this extremely muscular humanoid torso
with elongated, exaggerated arms and fingers.

1614
01:39:18,076 --> 01:39:26,317
Seemingly featureless across its body other than
its black, obsidian torso. No legs. They disappear

1615
01:39:26,317 --> 01:39:33,290
into the smoke beneath it. Its head has the long,
hooked, birdlike skull beak, and where the eyes

1616
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:39,840
are, it's just this smooth, almost leathery
texture across the dark body itself. You can see

1617
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,550
what looks like faint horns that curve around the
back, that curl upward. And as it takes the

1618
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:51,701
impact, its head rolls back and you can hear this
billowing scream: (moaning cry) As it leans back

1619
01:39:51,701 --> 01:39:57,274
forward towards you, it looks like it's having a
rough moment. Now we get to its turn.

1620
01:39:57,274 --> 01:39:58,240
LAURA: Oh no.

1621
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:02,014
MATT: All right.

1622
01:40:02,014 --> 01:40:08,750
TRAVIS: It farts a little cloud of smoke.

1623
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:11,531
TALIESIN: A lot of us are outside the Faerie
Fire.

1624
01:40:11,531 --> 01:40:18,395
MATT: Based on that, it zeroes down on the little
ball of radiant energy staring before it that just

1625
01:40:18,395 --> 01:40:24,468
blasted a hole in its form. It's going to take all
three of its strikes at you, Pike.

1626
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:26,777
TALIESIN: It's got disadvantage on its attacks.

1627
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:31,701
MATT: And has advantage because she's in Faerie
Fire, so it cancels it to a natural attack. That

1628
01:40:31,701 --> 01:40:38,441
is 21. What's your AC?

1629
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:40,481
ASHLEY: 20.

1630
01:40:40,481 --> 01:40:46,529
MATT: 20, so that hits. 27. And a natural one.

1631
01:40:46,529 --> 01:40:47,930
MARISHA: Oh!

1632
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:49,943
MATT: It was like 19... one.

1633
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,400
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1634
01:40:51,400 --> 01:41:05,429
MATT: All right, so... That would be 14 points of
psychic damage.

1635
01:41:05,429 --> 01:41:07,389
ASHLEY: Okay.

1636
01:41:07,389 --> 01:41:15,903
MATT: Oh. No, I'm sorry, because of the roll
there-- that's 14 plus an additional 12, so that's

1637
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,682
16 for the first strike.

1638
01:41:17,682 --> 01:41:21,431
SAM: (quietly) 12? That's 26.

1639
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:26,630
MATT: Right, it was 12 on top of the original
amount, which I said was 16?

1640
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,745
SAM: 14.

1641
01:41:28,745 --> 01:41:29,856
TALIESIN: 14 and then 12.

1642
01:41:29,856 --> 01:41:33,674
MATT: 14 and 12, yeah, so it was 26 psychic damage
you took on the first strike and the second one

1643
01:41:33,674 --> 01:41:35,571
was seven, too. 21.

1644
01:41:35,571 --> 01:41:37,837
ASHLEY: I thought the second one failed?

1645
01:41:37,837 --> 01:41:39,636
MATT: The third one. It has three attacks.

1646
01:41:39,636 --> 01:41:41,668
ASHLEY: Oh, there's three.

1647
01:41:41,668 --> 01:41:42,717
MATT: Yeah.

1648
01:41:42,717 --> 01:41:44,517
ASHLEY: Okay, so what was the total, sorry?

1649
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:51,445
MATT: It would be 26 and 21, so yeah, 47 points of
psychic damage as its arm reaches out towards you

1650
01:41:51,445 --> 01:41:57,278
and strikes. Also, I need you to make a wisdom
saving throw.

1651
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:58,381
TALIESIN: With advantage.

1652
01:41:58,381 --> 01:41:59,547
MATT: With advantage.

1653
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:01,968
SAM: And with beauty.

1654
01:42:01,968 --> 01:42:04,016
TALIESIN: Grace. Dignity.

1655
01:42:04,016 --> 01:42:05,681
LIAM: Skype.

1656
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:16,172
ASHLEY: Okay. 20.

1657
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:18,193
MATT: You're doing your Hunter's Mark damage?

1658
01:42:18,193 --> 01:42:19,655
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, I did.

1659
01:42:19,655 --> 01:42:20,714
MATT: So what was that?

1660
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:21,624
LIAM: 20.

1661
01:42:21,624 --> 01:42:22,516
ASHLEY: 20.

1662
01:42:22,516 --> 01:42:28,357
MATT: 20. Yeah, you feel as its claws move through
your body, elements of its shadow essence reach up

1663
01:42:28,357 --> 01:42:33,083
and try to grasp an element of your willpower. You
shrug it off. The might of Sarenrae is too strong

1664
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:35,535
and it has no way of grasping your intent.

1665
01:42:35,535 --> 01:42:36,616
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

1666
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:38,410
ASHLEY: Yeah, get out of here!

1667
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:45,232
MATT: Unfortunately, that used all of its
movement. It cannot withdraw into the room. That

1668
01:42:45,232 --> 01:42:50,643
will be the end of its turn. Let's see if that
recharges. Oh, it does. Okay.

1669
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:52,502
That brings us to Grog.

1670
01:42:52,502 --> 01:42:53,574
TRAVIS: It does?

1671
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:54,842
MATT: Yep, you're back up to your turn now.

1672
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,345
TRAVIS: (grunts) I want to hit it again!

1673
01:42:56,345 --> 01:42:57,467
MATT: Go for it.

1674
01:42:57,467 --> 01:43:00,147
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage?

1675
01:43:00,147 --> 01:43:01,584
MARISHA: Yes.

1676
01:43:01,584 --> 01:43:04,442
TRAVIS: Faerie Fire. That's better. 24.

1677
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:06,112
MATT: Okay.

1678
01:43:06,112 --> 01:43:10,524
TRAVIS: The second one is... 21.

1679
01:43:10,524 --> 01:43:11,605
MATT: Hits.

1680
01:43:11,605 --> 01:43:12,645
TRAVIS: Nice.

1681
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:14,000
MATT: Just barely.

1682
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,481
TRAVIS: First one is 15.

1683
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:20,862
MATT: Okay.

1684
01:43:20,862 --> 01:43:28,746
TRAVIS: 18.

1685
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:36,443
MATT: 18, okay. You hit the side of its body and
you can see now, small cracks in its black form

1686
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:40,011
are starting to form and you can see a bit of that
purplish energy leaking out. It's starting to

1687
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:48,514
actually visibly show a difficulty in keeping its
corporeal form. As both blows slam into it, you

1688
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:53,526
can see it shaking, and there is a struggle to its
movement. Do you want to stay where you are, or do

1689
01:43:53,526 --> 01:43:54,774
you want to move?

1690
01:43:54,774 --> 01:43:55,721
TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.

1691
01:43:55,721 --> 01:43:57,173
MATT: Okay. Keyleth.

1692
01:43:57,173 --> 01:44:01,627
MARISHA: He's totally surrounded, pretty much,
right?

1693
01:44:01,627 --> 01:44:02,716
MATT: Essentially.

1694
01:44:02,716 --> 01:44:06,723
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm actually going to throw up--
I'm going to maintain my Faerie Fire.

1695
01:44:06,723 --> 01:44:07,923
SAM: You're going to throw up?

1696
01:44:07,923 --> 01:44:08,907
MARISHA: I'm going to-- yes.

1697
01:44:08,907 --> 01:44:10,104
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (retching noises)

1698
01:44:10,104 --> 01:44:11,379
(laughter)

1699
01:44:11,379 --> 01:44:14,008
MARISHA: (dry-heaving noises) It's purple.

1700
01:44:14,008 --> 01:44:15,975
SAM: I hold her hair back.

1701
01:44:15,975 --> 01:44:21,148
MARISHA: And I say, (slurred) I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry.

1702
01:44:21,148 --> 01:44:22,621
SAM: That's okay. It's okay.

1703
01:44:22,621 --> 01:44:29,659
MARISHA: (laughing) How tall is the ceiling?

1704
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:31,290
TALIESIN: 12 feet.

1705
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:32,558
MATT: About 12 feet, yeah.

1706
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:37,323
MARISHA: I'm going to take a Daylight beam and go
(bing) right over top of it like a nice pretty

1707
01:44:37,323 --> 01:44:38,383
spotlight.

1708
01:44:38,383 --> 01:44:39,443
MATT: Okay.

1709
01:44:39,443 --> 01:44:40,547
TRAVIS: Ah!

1710
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:44,671
MATT: All right. Which, that is a concentration
spell.

1711
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:47,474
MARISHA: It's not, actually. It's an action that
lasts for an hour.

1712
01:44:47,474 --> 01:44:50,005
MATT: Interesting! I would assume that was.

1713
01:44:50,005 --> 01:44:52,793
MARISHA: I looked it up just now.

1714
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:59,616
MATT: This little spark ball of daylight opens up
on the ceiling like a bright spotlight that fills

1715
01:44:59,616 --> 01:45:03,651
the area. As it does, you can see the creature
(howling groan) shrinks away from it, and its

1716
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:06,507
smoke actually dissipates, lowering its armor
class again.

1717
01:45:06,507 --> 01:45:08,721
SAM: Oh, that's a good move!

1718
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:12,481
MATT: All right. Are you going to stay where you
are, or are you going to move?

1719
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:14,947
MARISHA: I'll take another step back.

1720
01:45:14,947 --> 01:45:16,041
MATT: Okay.

1721
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:17,193
MARISHA: That's good.

1722
01:45:17,193 --> 01:45:28,491
MATT: All right. With that... Okay. There's a
momentary whisper in the shadow around you. And

1723
01:45:28,491 --> 01:45:33,296
the sound of chains. I want everyone to make a
perception check.

1724
01:45:33,296 --> 01:45:34,594
MARISHA: What?

1725
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:37,734
TALIESIN: Damn!

1726
01:45:37,734 --> 01:45:40,366
TRAVIS: So close.

1727
01:45:40,366 --> 01:45:41,437
TALIESIN: 26.

1728
01:45:41,437 --> 01:45:42,654
MATT: 26.

1729
01:45:42,654 --> 01:45:43,589
TRAVIS: 19.

1730
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:44,416
LAURA: 20.

1731
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:45,323
LIAM: 20.

1732
01:45:45,323 --> 01:45:46,229
SAM: 17.

1733
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:47,086
MARISHA: 16.

1734
01:45:47,086 --> 01:45:48,106
SAM: Pike?

1735
01:45:48,106 --> 01:45:48,996
ASHLEY: 17.

1736
01:45:48,996 --> 01:45:52,208
MATT: Okay. So all of you continue focusing.

1737
01:45:52,208 --> 01:45:55,408
SAM: Oh, whispers! Whispers and whispers.

1738
01:45:55,408 --> 01:45:59,117
LIAM: The whispers are back! It's like we're back
in Casa de WillingBlam.

1739
01:45:59,117 --> 01:46:03,175
MARISHA: Whispers are so exciting.

1740
01:46:03,175 --> 01:46:07,398
LAURA: I know. I really did miss the whispers. I
hadn't even realized how much I

1741
01:46:07,398 --> 01:46:08,758
missed them until today.

1742
01:46:08,758 --> 01:46:14,616
SAM: Ashley, Matt is whispering in Taliesin's ear,
just so you know.

1743
01:46:14,616 --> 01:46:15,889
MARISHA: Sweet nothings.

1744
01:46:15,889 --> 01:46:17,886
TALIESIN: Fuck. Really?

1745
01:46:17,886 --> 01:46:20,518
LAURA: He's licking his ear a lot.

1746
01:46:20,561 --> 01:46:23,086
ASHLEY: He's giving him a wet willie?

1747
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:24,389
SAM: Yes.

1748
01:46:24,389 --> 01:46:25,753
LIAM: Really, really.

1749
01:46:25,753 --> 01:46:28,354
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up. What's your
turn?

1750
01:46:28,354 --> 01:46:34,537
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt it
again.

1751
01:46:34,537 --> 01:46:38,119
MATT: Okay. Same deal?

1752
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:40,114
TALIESIN: I can't tell you yet. It's not my turn.

1753
01:46:40,114 --> 01:46:47,703
MATT: Go ahead and make your single attack roll
right now because the previous thing is--

1754
01:46:47,703 --> 01:46:49,277
ASHLEY: (sighs) Ten.

1755
01:46:49,277 --> 01:46:54,074
MATT: Okay. Yeah, so this time, it's ready for you
and it dodges out of the way. The blast hits the

1756
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:59,342
stone wall behind it and cracks it slightly. Do
you want to move or stay where you are?

1757
01:46:59,342 --> 01:47:01,823
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll move away from it.

1758
01:47:01,823 --> 01:47:03,585
MATT: It will get an attack of opportunity on
you.

1759
01:47:03,585 --> 01:47:08,325
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on a minute. I should probably
take a potion or something.

1760
01:47:08,325 --> 01:47:09,963
MATT: It's up to you.

1761
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:11,093
LAURA: Are you low?

1762
01:47:11,093 --> 01:47:12,683
ASHLEY: I'm pretty low.

1763
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:14,006
LAURA: Pike!

1764
01:47:14,006 --> 01:47:15,852
MARISHA: Oh, I could have done something about
that.

1765
01:47:15,852 --> 01:47:25,011
ASHLEY: Nope. It's okay. I'm going to take a--
what do I have in here? It just says I have a

1766
01:47:25,011 --> 01:47:26,860
healing potion. God, I don't know what that
means.

1767
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:30,324
MATT: That would be the lowest. That's 2d4 plus
two.

1768
01:47:30,324 --> 01:47:34,208
LAURA: Didn't you get healed from your own
healing?

1769
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:40,716
ASHLEY: Well, I don't have enough-- I don't think
I have enough left. I want to save them.

1770
01:47:40,716 --> 01:47:41,802
LAURA: Yeah.

1771
01:47:41,802 --> 01:47:47,560
ASHLEY: Okay. Two. Six. Okay, eight.

1772
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,884
MATT: Okay, you heal eight and did you want to
move back or stay where you are?

1773
01:47:50,884 --> 01:47:53,676
ASHLEY: I'll stay.

1774
01:47:53,676 --> 01:48:06,081
MATT: Okay, so you stay where you are. All right.
Cassandra keeps running off this way and halts for

1775
01:48:06,081 --> 01:48:07,044
a second.

1776
01:48:07,044 --> 01:48:10,855
SAM: Wait, who's that? Who's going? Oh, that's
Cassandra? We're okay with her running away?

1777
01:48:10,855 --> 01:48:12,036
LAURA: She's running away.

1778
01:48:12,036 --> 01:48:15,872
MATT: He sent her running away. Top is Vex. You're
up.

1779
01:48:15,872 --> 01:48:16,746
LAURA: Me?

1780
01:48:16,746 --> 01:48:17,702
MATT: Yes.

1781
01:48:17,702 --> 01:48:23,660
LAURA: Okay. Who all's around him? Pike and Grog?

1782
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,055
MATT: Pike and Grog and technically Trinket, as
well, are all in melee.

1783
01:48:27,055 --> 01:48:30,383
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to shoot a couple
of arrows at him again, man.

1784
01:48:30,383 --> 01:48:31,435
MATT: Okay.

1785
01:48:31,435 --> 01:48:34,471
LAURA: I can't do anything. But he's still
advantage, right?

1786
01:48:34,471 --> 01:48:37,073
MATT: It's advantage against him, yes.

1787
01:48:37,073 --> 01:48:43,217
LAURA: 21?

1788
01:48:43,217 --> 01:48:44,717
MATT: 21 hits.

1789
01:48:44,717 --> 01:48:48,419
LAURA: And 28.

1790
01:48:48,419 --> 01:48:49,958
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1791
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,381
LAURA: Okay.

1792
01:48:51,381 --> 01:48:57,672
MATT: These will be your last holy arrows because
you've used six.

1793
01:48:57,672 --> 01:48:59,839
LAURA: No. I'm out of holy arrows.

1794
01:48:59,839 --> 01:49:01,083
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's right.

1795
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:02,982
LAURA: Because one of them was my exploding
arrow.

1796
01:49:02,982 --> 01:49:04,934
MATT: Yeah, so these are just regular.

1797
01:49:04,934 --> 01:49:15,308
LAURA: So that's... 21 for the first.

1798
01:49:15,308 --> 01:49:16,506
MATT: Nice, all right.

1799
01:49:16,506 --> 01:49:19,218
LAURA: Shitballs. Well, there you go. Goodbye.

1800
01:49:19,218 --> 01:49:22,418
LIAM: It was a 20.

1801
01:49:22,418 --> 01:49:25,678
LAURA: 21 for the second.

1802
01:49:25,678 --> 01:49:30,936
MATT: Nice. 42 points of damage this round. These
arrows now find their way towards the cracks that

1803
01:49:30,936 --> 01:49:35,431
are starting to appear in its chest and as each
one strikes in, these arrows are actually visibly

1804
01:49:35,431 --> 01:49:40,577
staying in its body. What was once this amorphous
smoke, after the impacts from Grog and as it

1805
01:49:40,577 --> 01:49:44,935
begins to wear itself down, it's starting to find
it harder and harder to keep this ethereal form,

1806
01:49:44,935 --> 01:49:49,066
so now these arrows are sticking out of these
cracks of purplish, glowing energy and it's moving

1807
01:49:49,066 --> 01:49:50,634
a little more sluggishly.

1808
01:49:50,634 --> 01:49:52,458
LAURA: I hide again for my bonus.

1809
01:49:52,458 --> 01:49:58,779
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check. Scanlan, you're
up.

1810
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:00,266
SAM: Scanlan's up?

1811
01:50:00,266 --> 01:50:01,776
LAURA: 21 stealth.

1812
01:50:01,776 --> 01:50:04,901
MATT: Good to know. All right.

1813
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:06,957
SAM: Do I have my wits about me?

1814
01:50:06,957 --> 01:50:07,771
MATT: You do.

1815
01:50:07,771 --> 01:50:08,799
SAM: Oh, that's nice.

1816
01:50:08,799 --> 01:50:13,604
MATT: You just feel like there's an aspect-- you
get the sense you probably don't want to be close

1817
01:50:13,604 --> 01:50:14,936
to it.

1818
01:50:14,936 --> 01:50:18,587
SAM: Okay. I charge at it! No.

1819
01:50:18,587 --> 01:50:20,464
(laughter)

1820
01:50:20,464 --> 01:50:22,988
MATT: That's the Scanlan I know and love.

1821
01:50:22,988 --> 01:50:26,713
SAM: I have so little that I can do.

1822
01:50:26,713 --> 01:50:28,819
MATT: Suddenly there's a stained-glass wall behind
it.

1823
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:31,025
TALIESIN: Wow, in-joke.

1824
01:50:31,063 --> 01:50:43,637
SAM: As my bonus action, I will-- as my movement,
I (sighs) tragically, flip the gun to Percy.

1825
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:45,301
MATT: Okay.

1826
01:50:45,301 --> 01:50:46,600
LIAM: It's two pieces.

1827
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,202
LAURA: No, the one that I gave him.

1828
01:50:48,202 --> 01:50:52,303
SAM: No, the good gun. In the-- what's that Martin
Lawrence movie? Bad Boys. They did it all in slow

1829
01:50:52,303 --> 01:50:59,406
motion. Just throw the gun. Okay. As a bonus
action, I will Healing Word Pike.

1830
01:50:59,406 --> 01:51:00,710
MATT: Okay.

1831
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:01,957
SAM: Did she heal herself okay?

1832
01:51:01,957 --> 01:51:03,045
LAURA: No, she didn't.

1833
01:51:03,045 --> 01:51:10,640
SAM: Okay, I will Healing Word her, and I'll sing,
believe it or not, you're made mostly of air. I

1834
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:14,752
never thought you could feel so free.

1835
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:17,496
MATT: All right, what level are you using Healing
Word at?

1836
01:51:17,496 --> 01:51:18,769
SAM: Just at one.

1837
01:51:18,769 --> 01:51:19,712
MATT: Level one? Okay.

1838
01:51:19,712 --> 01:51:22,676
SAM: d4 plus five. Lame.

1839
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:24,802
MATT: 1d4 plus five.

1840
01:51:24,802 --> 01:51:26,849
SAM: Eight. Eight, honey. I love you.

1841
01:51:26,849 --> 01:51:28,983
ASHLEY: "Thanks!" I blow him a smoke kiss.

1842
01:51:28,983 --> 01:51:39,098
SAM: Oh! I love it. And then for my move, my
action, my whatever you call it... I've got

1843
01:51:39,098 --> 01:51:47,281
fucking nothing, man! I say to the beast, to the
whatever it is, I say, and another thing! Your

1844
01:51:47,281 --> 01:51:55,984
smoking encourages minors to smoke and creates an
aura that makes going to restaurants not pleasant

1845
01:51:55,984 --> 01:52:01,476
and it's just horrible. It makes your clothes
stink. It's terrible. So another Vicious

1846
01:52:01,476 --> 01:52:02,650
Mockery.

1847
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:06,388
TRAVIS: (laughing) Please. Please be enough.

1848
01:52:06,388 --> 01:52:09,583
TALIESIN: Please let this be what kills him.

1849
01:52:09,583 --> 01:52:12,667
MARISHA: Please. He's laughing like it is.
Wouldn't that be the third time this has

1850
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:13,758
happened?

1851
01:52:13,758 --> 01:52:18,116
MATT: All right. Roll damage. 3d4 psychic damage.

1852
01:52:18,116 --> 01:52:21,198
LAURA: Come on, come on.

1853
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:22,250
SAM: Eight.

1854
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:29,332
MATT: Eight. All right. You can see now, it turns
to you for a second and the Mark of Vengeance

1855
01:52:29,332 --> 01:52:36,694
fades as suddenly you feel like you've damaged it
mentally enough to the point where it doesn't even

1856
01:52:36,694 --> 01:52:39,854
want to deal with you anymore. You're far too
mean.

1857
01:52:39,854 --> 01:52:42,232
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're too mean.

1858
01:52:42,232 --> 01:52:44,311
SAM: Take that!

1859
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:46,648
MATT: You're going to stay where you are?

1860
01:52:46,648 --> 01:52:47,582
SAM: Yes.

1861
01:52:47,582 --> 01:52:49,626
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up.

1862
01:52:49,626 --> 01:52:53,288
TALIESIN: I yell, Delilah's getting away!

1863
01:52:53,329 --> 01:52:59,355
MATT: You guys all glance over. The shackles that
are on the ground are now collapsed and empty.

1864
01:52:59,355 --> 01:53:00,554
SAM: Oh shit!

1865
01:53:00,554 --> 01:53:05,894
MATT: With the gag safely removed from her mouth
during this allowed her to cast Misty Step, which

1866
01:53:05,894 --> 01:53:10,000
is a verbal-based spell. She is currently--

1867
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,278
TALIESIN: How far away?

1868
01:53:11,278 --> 01:53:13,021
MATT: I'm calculating that right now.

1869
01:53:13,021 --> 01:53:14,553
TALIESIN: And can I see her?

1870
01:53:14,553 --> 01:53:17,967
MATT: I'm going to have to ask you to roll a
perception check here in a minute.

1871
01:53:17,967 --> 01:53:18,996
TALIESIN: Okay.

1872
01:53:18,996 --> 01:53:20,629
LAURA: Oh my god.

1873
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:25,729
TALIESIN: And the question is-- yeah, I'm curious
how far she got.

1874
01:53:25,729 --> 01:53:30,275
TRAVIS: We didn't bind her?

1875
01:53:30,275 --> 01:53:32,419
LAURA: Because we're morons.

1876
01:53:32,419 --> 01:53:33,918
TRAVIS: Well, she got out of her manacles.

1877
01:53:33,918 --> 01:53:36,234
MARISHA: She Misty Stepped, so she turned into
air.

1878
01:53:36,234 --> 01:53:43,342
MATT: She landed, cast Invisibility, and vanished,
and you just hear the footsteps down the hall.

1879
01:53:43,342 --> 01:53:48,549
You're not quite sure where she is or how far
she's gotten, but you know she's down that way.

1880
01:53:48,549 --> 01:53:50,249
LAURA: (gasps) Cassandra!

1881
01:53:50,249 --> 01:53:51,576
TALIESIN: Cassandra's right there.

1882
01:53:51,576 --> 01:53:56,459
MATT: Yeah. Cassandra doesn't notice. She's just
been running because you told her to run. She did

1883
01:53:56,459 --> 01:54:01,020
hear you shout and she looked over her shoulder,
but not in time for her to see anything happen,

1884
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:06,715
because this all happened during the last round,
during your realization. You guys look around and

1885
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:10,034
Delilah's gone. You're the only one who really saw
the direction she's going, but it's your turn.

1886
01:54:10,034 --> 01:54:13,657
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch, we left her alive.

1887
01:54:13,657 --> 01:54:15,921
LAURA: I cannot believe we left her alive!

1888
01:54:15,921 --> 01:54:17,853
SAM: I'm sure it'll be fine.

1889
01:54:17,853 --> 01:54:21,537
TRAVIS: I'm fucking pissed.

1890
01:54:21,537 --> 01:54:28,112
SAM: Maybe she's learned the error of her ways.

1891
01:54:28,112 --> 01:54:31,211
MATT: What are you doing?

1892
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:34,116
TALIESIN: Fuck! Ugh. Okay, I'm going to--

1893
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:35,452
SAM: Chase her?

1894
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:36,774
MARISHA: Tell us where she is.

1895
01:54:36,774 --> 01:54:44,216
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- fuck! Ugh, goddamn it.
I'm going to double my speed. I'm going to burn my

1896
01:54:44,216 --> 01:54:46,079
turn double-speeding, trying to--

1897
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:48,504
MATT: Trying to catch up?

1898
01:54:48,504 --> 01:54:49,642
TALIESIN: Trying to catch up.

1899
01:54:49,642 --> 01:54:50,630
MATT: Okay.

1900
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:54,084
TALIESIN: And then as I pass my sister, I yell,
she went this way. She's invisible.

1901
01:54:54,084 --> 01:54:54,976
MATT: Okay.

1902
01:54:54,976 --> 01:54:55,847
SAM: Do I hear that?

1903
01:54:55,847 --> 01:54:57,155
TALIESIN: She went this way! She's invisible!

1904
01:54:57,155 --> 01:54:57,946
SAM: I hear it.

1905
01:54:57,946 --> 01:54:58,954
MARISHA: We hear it.

1906
01:54:58,954 --> 01:54:59,710
LIAM: Yep.

1907
01:54:59,710 --> 01:55:01,409
MATT: All right, so that's Percy's turn.

1908
01:55:01,409 --> 01:55:03,038
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, everybody.

1909
01:55:03,038 --> 01:55:05,686
MATT: For the situation, make a perception check.

1910
01:55:05,686 --> 01:55:06,885
TALIESIN: All right.

1911
01:55:06,885 --> 01:55:08,982
ASHLEY: You've got to do what you've got to do.

1912
01:55:08,982 --> 01:55:13,342
TALIESIN: Do I have--

1913
01:55:13,342 --> 01:55:16,760
MATT: No. You do not have advantage on this.

1914
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,568
TALIESIN: I'm adding my bonus die.

1915
01:55:18,568 --> 01:55:19,903
SAM: You have inspiration.

1916
01:55:19,903 --> 01:55:26,020
TALIESIN: Yeah, I haven't used my inspiration die.
23.

1917
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:31,873
MATT: 23. Okay. You see a couple of the recent
footsteps, but you don't see them freshly being

1918
01:55:31,873 --> 01:55:35,139
made, so you know she's not too far yet.

1919
01:55:35,139 --> 01:55:39,837
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow that path of
footsteps. I'm keeping an eye on them.

1920
01:55:39,837 --> 01:55:42,586
MATT: Good to know. Vax, you're up.

1921
01:55:42,586 --> 01:55:47,383
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use my bonus action
to dash and run 60 feet after Percy to catch up.

1922
01:55:47,383 --> 01:55:49,965
LAURA: What? You're not going to kill the smoke
beast?

1923
01:55:49,965 --> 01:55:51,921
LIAM: You're going to kill the smoke beast.

1924
01:55:51,921 --> 01:55:56,573
MATT: Okay, so you use your bonus dash, your
movement to get there, so you move up 60.

1925
01:55:56,573 --> 01:56:02,837
LIAM: So that's 60 feet from where I was? Okay,
and I'm going to throw a dagger after-- well, can

1926
01:56:02,837 --> 01:56:05,576
I do a perception check and that, or is that two
different things?

1927
01:56:05,576 --> 01:56:09,805
MATT: Honestly, once the creature's invisible and
you don't know where it was, you don't even get a

1928
01:56:09,805 --> 01:56:12,647
chance to check at this distance, so it's just
attacking at disadvantage.

1929
01:56:12,647 --> 01:56:14,329
LIAM: All right, I'm going to attack at
disadvantage, then.

1930
01:56:14,329 --> 01:56:15,648
MATT: All right.

1931
01:56:15,648 --> 01:56:21,625
LIAM: That is a 14.

1932
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:28,381
MATT: 14 is a miss. (whoosh) It returns to your
belt. Finds no purchase.

1933
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:30,125
LIAM: No, it was an 18.

1934
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:31,962
LAURA: It was an 18. He rolled 18.

1935
01:56:31,962 --> 01:56:33,855
MATT: That was an 18?

1936
01:56:33,855 --> 01:56:41,573
LIAM: Yeah. Seven plus 11 is 18.

1937
01:56:41,573 --> 01:56:47,344
MATT: Seven plus 11 is indeed 18. Go ahead and
roll damage.

1938
01:56:47,344 --> 01:56:49,108
LAURA: See?

1939
01:56:49,108 --> 01:56:50,696
LIAM: Thanks. Thanks, sis.

1940
01:56:50,696 --> 01:56:53,457
LAURA: No problem. This is why I look over your
shoulder even when my math is bad.

1941
01:56:53,457 --> 01:56:58,991
LIAM: Okay, that is eight.

1942
01:56:58,991 --> 01:57:00,746
MATT: Eight? Okay.

1943
01:57:00,746 --> 01:57:02,453
LAURA: But she was almost unconscious.

1944
01:57:02,453 --> 01:57:08,548
MATT: At this point, as you're running, you're
rushing forward. To the left of your ear, you hear

1945
01:57:08,548 --> 01:57:16,505
(impact noise) and you glance over your shoulder.
And there, face down on the ground, is Delilah,

1946
01:57:16,505 --> 01:57:20,513
sprawled out, face down in the dirt with a single
dagger sticking out of the center of her back.

1947
01:57:20,513 --> 01:57:22,636
LIAM: For a second.

1948
01:57:22,636 --> 01:57:24,570
LAURA: And then it's gone.

1949
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:28,642
MATT: And then it disappears. And blood begins to
pour out from the wound.

1950
01:57:28,642 --> 01:57:29,987
SAM: She's dead. You killed her.

1951
01:57:29,987 --> 01:57:31,269
MATT: All right.

1952
01:57:31,269 --> 01:57:33,948
TALIESIN: Is she dead?

1953
01:57:33,948 --> 01:57:45,737
MATT: You'd have to go and inspect. Now it is
Orthax's turn. Orthax is going to move here, still

1954
01:57:45,737 --> 01:57:50,406
remain in melee, and is going to use a secondary
rampage pulse, since it recharges. Gives out

1955
01:57:50,406 --> 01:57:58,785
another desperate scream (raspy roar) outwards in
the vicinity. 20-foot radius. I need Keyleth, Vex,

1956
01:57:58,785 --> 01:58:05,110
Trinket, Pike, and Grog to all make wisdom saving
throws with advantage.

1957
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:08,102
MARISHA: I'll take a 12.

1958
01:58:08,102 --> 01:58:10,138
MATT: 12?

1959
01:58:10,138 --> 01:58:11,234
MARISHA: 25 total.

1960
01:58:11,234 --> 01:58:12,274
MATT: Oh, 25 total.

1961
01:58:12,274 --> 01:58:13,247
TRAVIS: 12.

1962
01:58:13,247 --> 01:58:14,274
MATT: 12.

1963
01:58:14,274 --> 01:58:17,344
LAURA: Wait. 19 for me.

1964
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:25,886
ASHLEY: 22.

1965
01:58:25,886 --> 01:58:28,116
LAURA: 13 for Trinket.

1966
01:58:28,116 --> 01:58:37,208
MATT: Okay, so Vex, Keyleth, and Pike, you guys
all take five points of psychic damage as you

1967
01:58:37,208 --> 01:58:46,903
cover your ears momentarily. Grog and Trinket both
take ten points of psychic damage. Both turn

1968
01:58:46,903 --> 01:58:53,952
immediately, flanking Pike, who has been the
radiant blaster across this entity. I need you to

1969
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:57,648
make an attack and I need Trinket to make an
attack against Pike. You guys both have advantage

1970
01:58:57,648 --> 01:58:59,503
because she's in the Faerie Fire.

1971
01:58:59,503 --> 01:59:00,781
MARISHA: Fuck.

1972
01:59:00,781 --> 01:59:05,219
TRAVIS: Yes! Three and a four. 13.

1973
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:06,579
MATT: 13. Okay.

1974
01:59:06,579 --> 01:59:09,084
LIAM: Trinket rolled a natural 20.

1975
01:59:09,084 --> 01:59:11,259
TALIESIN: Whoa!

1976
01:59:11,259 --> 01:59:16,768
MATT: All right, so Pike. This blast comes out
ringing in your ears and as your vision comes back

1977
01:59:16,768 --> 01:59:21,308
to you and you look up, all you see is Grog
lifting this giant hammer with his eyes clouded in

1978
01:59:21,308 --> 01:59:25,887
the same black smoke material. You bring up your
shield and as the hammer comes down, striking at

1979
01:59:25,887 --> 01:59:28,913
you, you know there's a bruise going to be on your
forearm tomorrow because the sheer force of it

1980
01:59:28,913 --> 01:59:33,314
hits you, but at the same time, you know it's not
the friend you grew up with. And you look up into

1981
01:59:33,314 --> 01:59:37,770
his face as the cloud fades and you can see an
expression of immediate regret on his face.

1982
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:39,544
TRAVIS: What? What did I do?

1983
01:59:39,544 --> 01:59:45,636
MATT: Before you can respond, though, the bear
behind you. Trinket snarls (roar) and latches on.

1984
01:59:45,636 --> 01:59:46,749
Go ahead and roll damage.

1985
01:59:46,749 --> 01:59:49,080
LAURA: Do you want a bite attack or a claw
attack?

1986
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,084
MATT: I'm going to have to probably go bite on
this.

1987
01:59:51,084 --> 01:59:54,482
ASHLEY: Oh no.

1988
01:59:54,482 --> 02:00:01,048
MATT: So roll the dice and then that times two.

1989
02:00:01,048 --> 02:00:05,296
LAURA: Oh, right, I have to-- no, yeah. Okay.
That's 11.

1990
02:00:05,296 --> 02:00:10,638
MATT: So you take 11 points of piercing damage as
all of a sudden, Trinket sinks his jaws into the

1991
02:00:10,638 --> 02:00:11,938
back of your shoulder.

1992
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:12,954
SAM: Times two?

1993
02:00:12,954 --> 02:00:14,946
LIAM: Yeah, times two. Natural 20.

1994
02:00:14,946 --> 02:00:17,195
MATT: Oh. Oh, that wasn't with the multiplier.
What did you roll on the dice?

1995
02:00:17,195 --> 02:00:18,782
LAURA: I rolled 11.

1996
02:00:18,782 --> 02:00:21,409
MATT: On the dice? So 22, plus whatever the
modifier is.

1997
02:00:21,409 --> 02:00:23,877
LAURA: What? No!

1998
02:00:23,877 --> 02:00:26,727
LIAM: That's eight plus the modifier.

1999
02:00:26,727 --> 02:00:28,570
LAURA: Oh! Okay. 15!

2000
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:30,703
MATT: Okay, so 16 plus whatever the modifier is.

2001
02:00:30,703 --> 02:00:32,051
TALIESIN: 19, then.

2002
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:35,174
LAURA: No, I rolled four. Times two is eight.

2003
02:00:35,174 --> 02:00:37,137
LIAM: Plus the modifier of seven.

2004
02:00:37,137 --> 02:00:38,340
LIAM and LAURA: Is 15.

2005
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:41,346
MATT: There we go. Thank you so much for
clarification. 15 points of piercing damage.

2006
02:00:41,346 --> 02:00:42,785
TALIESIN: Math, everybody!

2007
02:00:42,785 --> 02:00:49,868
MATT: And Trinket clenches down. You feel the armor
plates jamming together and it wrenches your

2008
02:00:49,868 --> 02:00:54,162
shoulder out of the socket. Not enough to actually
do too much serious damage. And immediately

2009
02:00:54,162 --> 02:00:59,460
Trinket pulls away and you hear this whine behind
you, this (sad moaning). His nose rubs against

2010
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,922
your head.

2011
02:01:00,922 --> 02:01:03,707
ASHLEY: I put my hand out and touch his nose and
tell him it's okay.

2012
02:01:03,707 --> 02:01:05,047
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh.

2013
02:01:05,047 --> 02:01:18,986
MATT: Okay. Orthax is at a point where-- no.
Orthax is going to turn and begin to chase after

2014
02:01:18,986 --> 02:01:20,444
Percy now.

2015
02:01:20,444 --> 02:01:21,949
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity.

2016
02:01:21,949 --> 02:01:25,048
MATT: Yes, I know. Grog and Pike and Trinket all
get attacks of opportunity.

2017
02:01:25,048 --> 02:01:26,247
MARISHA: Kill him!

2018
02:01:26,247 --> 02:01:27,452
TRAVIS: With advantage?

2019
02:01:27,452 --> 02:01:28,651
MATT: With advantage, yeah.

2020
02:01:28,651 --> 02:01:34,604
TRAVIS: Natural 20. First roll. Don't even need to
do it again.

2021
02:01:34,604 --> 02:01:37,214
MARISHA: Nat 20s all up in this bitch.

2022
02:01:37,214 --> 02:01:38,442
LAURA: 24.

2023
02:01:38,442 --> 02:01:39,653
MATT: Okay, and Pike?

2024
02:01:39,653 --> 02:01:40,813
ASHLEY: 16.

2025
02:01:40,813 --> 02:01:44,814
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately. So Pike, you
swing, but, still in pain from Trinket's attack

2026
02:01:44,814 --> 02:01:51,752
and Grog coming at you, you swing wide and it
passes through the space behind it. Grog, remember

2027
02:01:51,752 --> 02:01:54,308
to roll with an additional d12, too, because of
your brutal critical.

2028
02:01:54,308 --> 02:01:55,630
ASHLEY: Kill him.

2029
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:58,192
LAURA: 13 for Trinket.

2030
02:01:58,192 --> 02:01:59,795
MATT: 13 for Trinket. Awesome.

2031
02:01:59,795 --> 02:02:07,382
TRAVIS: (muttering) 20, 21, 22. (louder) 31
total.

2032
02:02:07,382 --> 02:02:10,228
MATT: 31 total. How do you and Trinket want to do
this?

2033
02:02:10,228 --> 02:02:12,785
(cheering)

2034
02:02:12,785 --> 02:02:14,800
ASHLEY: Wait, did you kill him?

2035
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,899
LAURA: Yeah!

2036
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:17,017
ASHLEY: Oh, yes!

2037
02:02:17,017 --> 02:02:22,308
TRAVIS: I'd like to pick up the hammer and slam
him down to the ground just so he's at Trinket's

2038
02:02:22,308 --> 02:02:23,507
head height.

2039
02:02:23,507 --> 02:02:27,906
LAURA: And then right when he gets to his height,
Trinket reaches up and bites him as hard as he can

2040
02:02:27,906 --> 02:02:30,599
and lashes him around like dog with a toy.

2041
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:36,635
MATT: Okay. As you slam it on the ground, (boof)
the smoke billows out around it and dissipates for

2042
02:02:36,635 --> 02:02:40,576
a moment where, as opposed to its obscured form,
you now have a very clear view of its physical

2043
02:02:40,576 --> 02:02:44,680
body. Just a little bit of smoke trailing about
where its lower torso and legs would be. As its

2044
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:50,270
arms reach out (slashing noise, grunt) and it
looks up, its head shaking as the purple cracks

2045
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:55,658
are rising up its body, it looks up straight into
the face of Trinket, who snarls. (growl, chomp)

2046
02:02:55,658 --> 02:03:01,289
And just lunges out, clamping onto its face and
tearing upward, its head arcing in the air. As it

2047
02:03:01,289 --> 02:03:08,133
does, the body (whoosh) dissipates into smoke and
sinks into the ground into this black shadow in

2048
02:03:08,133 --> 02:03:12,794
the dirt that (whoosh) races up the hallway in the
direction of Percy.

2049
02:03:12,794 --> 02:03:16,875
Percy, as you're stopping and looking over, you
look down just in time for the shadow to (whoosh)

2050
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:22,857
reach your legs, and you feel this cold rise up
your body and then slowly dissipate into this

2051
02:03:22,857 --> 02:03:26,669
little nugget of cold in the center of your chest,
and then vanish.

2052
02:03:26,669 --> 02:03:30,987
ASHLEY: Wait, but doesn't he have protection?

2053
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:33,105
MARISHA: How about the protection?

2054
02:03:33,105 --> 02:03:35,879
LAURA: He disappears. It disappeared. Maybe it
disappeared forever.

2055
02:03:35,879 --> 02:03:39,896
SAM: Or maybe it's always going to be there,
haunting us.

2056
02:03:39,896 --> 02:03:46,689
LIAM: While he's thinking, I walk up to Delilah,
grab her by the clothes, drag her to the side of

2057
02:03:46,689 --> 02:03:53,935
the wall and prop her up, and turn to Percy. And
say, end this.

2058
02:03:53,935 --> 02:03:55,837
TALIESIN: Cassandra?

2059
02:03:55,837 --> 02:04:06,840
MATT: Cassandra, who has now stopped, looks at
you. She clutches the rapier in her hand, and you

2060
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,469
can see her hand shaking, the tension of the
muscles in her fingers clenching it as hard as she

2061
02:04:10,469 --> 02:04:17,376
possibly can, as she walks up with each slow,
quiet step echoing across the stone. (footsteps)

2062
02:04:17,376 --> 02:04:22,883
Delilah up against the wall, blood spilling out of
the corner of her mouth, (coughs) coughing,

2063
02:04:22,883 --> 02:04:28,622
conscious, with her one missing arm to the side.
Blood's beginning to ooze now from the wound as

2064
02:04:28,622 --> 02:04:33,123
the sheer force of all the movement has torn the
wounds fresh open. And she's there and she looks

2065
02:04:33,123 --> 02:04:38,560
over out of the corner of her eye and turns,
seeing the rest of you, and sees Cassandra. As

2066
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,540
Cassandra steps up, she holds the rapier at her
side, staring down. This time, a single tear

2067
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:54,437
cresting down the side of her cheek. Delilah looks
up and goes, "You could have been my daughter."

2068
02:04:54,437 --> 02:05:12,549
She looks down at Delilah and says, "No. Cassandra
is a de Rolo, and you took them away from me. And

2069
02:05:12,549 --> 02:05:17,964
"now we're taking everything away from you." And
thrusts the rapier forward, right into the chest.

2070
02:05:17,964 --> 02:05:22,198
As it hits her, it actually pulls her up about a
foot against the wall. The sheer force of the

2071
02:05:22,198 --> 02:05:31,641
wound. (gasps, sighs) Last breath escaping from
Delilah's mouth. Her arm falls limp to the side.

2072
02:05:31,641 --> 02:05:37,401
The moment of tension passes and Cassandra's still
holding her there, her head down, her hair in

2073
02:05:37,401 --> 02:05:40,964
front of her face, just shaking, keeping her
pinned against the wall.

2074
02:05:40,964 --> 02:05:46,916
LAURA: (whispering) Percival.

2075
02:05:46,916 --> 02:05:50,920
TALIESIN: I put my hand on her shoulder and gently
pull her back.

2076
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:59,790
MATT: The rapier withdraws and the body tumbles to
the ground. She looks back at you, face just a

2077
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:04,535
mess. "Thank you."

2078
02:06:04,535 --> 02:06:07,262
TALIESIN: We have a lot to do.

2079
02:06:07,262 --> 02:06:20,548
MATT: "We do." And she hands the rapier back to
you, and she grabs the scruff of Delilah's collar

2080
02:06:20,548 --> 02:06:24,179
and begins dragging her up the hallway towards the
castle.

2081
02:06:24,179 --> 02:06:29,707
LAURA: Wait, I meant to loot her earlier and it
didn't happen. Sorry, I just

2082
02:06:29,707 --> 02:06:31,386
really like that part.

2083
02:06:31,386 --> 02:06:39,562
MATT: She drops the body and gives you a look.
"Hurry. If there's one thing I've learned here in

2084
02:06:39,562 --> 02:06:43,172
"Whitestone, it's that things do not stay dead
long."

2085
02:06:43,172 --> 02:06:47,613
LIAM: Seeing as I'm 50 feet ahead of my sister, I
walk ahead of her.

2086
02:06:47,613 --> 02:06:49,365
LAURA: Don't you fucking do this to me.

2087
02:06:49,365 --> 02:06:51,041
LIAM: Is she wearing a cloak?

2088
02:06:51,041 --> 02:07:01,029
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Inspecting the body, you find
a very fine pair of metallic bracers.

2089
02:07:01,029 --> 02:07:03,594
LAURA: (gasps) For archery purposes?

2090
02:07:03,594 --> 02:07:05,448
LIAM: You're not here.

2091
02:07:05,448 --> 02:07:07,515
LAURA: I'm like five feet away from you, at this
point.

2092
02:07:07,515 --> 02:07:10,534
MATT: Her robe, though soaked with blood, is very,
very well-made.

2093
02:07:10,534 --> 02:07:11,870
LIAM: I roll that up.

2094
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:15,694
MATT: Okay, so you roll up the robe. Her cloak
is--

2095
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:18,107
LIAM: No, that's what I meant. The cloak. I leave
the robe.

2096
02:07:18,107 --> 02:07:19,396
TALIESIN: No, take everything.

2097
02:07:19,396 --> 02:07:20,576
MARISHA: Take everything.

2098
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:23,150
LIAM: Yeah. All the fabric. I take it.

2099
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:26,994
MATT: Okay, you take all the fabric. The robe and
the cloak. So mark those down. The cloak itself

2100
02:07:26,994 --> 02:07:32,415
looked like cloth at a distance. Close up, you can
see it's actually a very fine dark black/purple

2101
02:07:32,415 --> 02:07:39,314
fur, and down at the side of it, you see dangling
these two long tentacles that end in these little

2102
02:07:39,314 --> 02:07:44,957
cupping spiked elements. It looks like it was
carved from a creature at one point.

2103
02:07:44,957 --> 02:07:46,151
LIAM: This is the cloak?

2104
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:47,016
MATT: The cloak.

2105
02:07:47,016 --> 02:07:48,405
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see?

2106
02:07:48,405 --> 02:07:49,490
MATT: Go for it.

2107
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:50,944
MARISHA: Because I think I know what it is.

2108
02:07:50,944 --> 02:07:54,206
LAURA: I get up in time to smack him upside the
head.

2109
02:07:54,206 --> 02:07:56,281
MARISHA: 29.

2110
02:07:56,281 --> 02:08:00,277
MATT: Yeah, you've actually fought these creatures
before. This is a displacer beast. It's a Cloak of

2111
02:08:00,277 --> 02:08:01,296
Displacement.

2112
02:08:01,296 --> 02:08:04,881
LIAM: I got the cloak and I walk away from it and
leave my sister to go sick on the rest of it.

2113
02:08:04,881 --> 02:08:13,192
LAURA: She's naked. Good job, brother.

2114
02:08:13,192 --> 02:08:15,347
MATT: Yeah, she's mostly nude, other than her
undergarments.

2115
02:08:15,347 --> 02:08:17,184
LIAM: I toss the robe back on her.

2116
02:08:17,184 --> 02:08:20,462
TALIESIN: Vax, Cassandra, let's take her to the
acid pits.

2117
02:08:20,462 --> 02:08:22,217
MATT: The only thing she has left is a ring on her
finger.

2118
02:08:22,217 --> 02:08:23,379
LAURA: What about those bracers you were talking
about?
