1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,572
MATT: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:08,606
of nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:12,383
am the dungeon master for the show, and we're
excited to have you. A couple of cool things about

4
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:17,016
this, for those who are checking in or aren't
aware of what's going on: our main party, Vox

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:22,207
Machina, has been split for two different trials.
We'll get into that story in a little bit, but

6
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:26,605
because of that, we have some guests playing. This
will be the second week of our two fantastic

7
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:34,063
guests, Wil Wheaton and Will Friedle. We're
excited about them. They're pretty nice. This is

8
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:38,998
the second week of the Wills; we're excited to
have them. Also, do we have any other

9
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,345
announcements anyone wants to talk about? Anything
crazy coming up?

10
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:50,209
MARISHA: Speaking of the Wills, just to talk about
the first two giveaways that we reached. That's

11
00:00:50,209 --> 00:01:01,402
it. Once it hits the board, it's done. It's like
the American flag. These are TableTop nail

12
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,890
wrap-specific.

13
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,062
WIL: Oh yeah, these are from our friends at
Espionage Cosmetics.

14
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:11,786
MARISHA: Yes, these are Espionage Cosmetics nail
wraps, and they're actual TableTop--

15
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:19,150
WIL: Yeah, they're official licensed TableTop
merchandise that we made happen. I'm very happy.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,797
MARISHA: So yes. Wear the support on your
fingertips.

17
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:35,336
WIL: I have two announcements. Announcement the
first: for the next four hours and 56 minutes,

18
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:39,726
Pacific Time, I am the King of the Internet
because I won yesterday on @Midnight.

19
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,247
MATT: Congratulations!

20
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:47,599
WIL: Also, Hardwick hipped me to this movie that I
want everybody to see, so I'm telling everyone I

21
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:54,265
know about it, and I won't shut up about it. It's
called What We Do in the Shadows. It is a comedy

22
00:01:54,265 --> 00:02:00,091
that is a documentary about a group of vampires
who live together in a house in

23
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,310
Wellington, New Zealand.

24
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,171
MATT: Oh wait, is this the one that has Jemaine
Clement in it?

25
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:03,887
WIL: Yeah.

26
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,057
MATT: Yeah, I've heard of this.

27
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:16,125
WIL: It is one of the most amazing, hilarious,
pitch-perfect, well-done genre comedy and horror

28
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:24,526
films I have ever seen. It is a delight, and I
want everyone to watch it because I'm afraid it's

29
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,586
not going to get the attention it deserves.

30
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:29,135
WILL: This is a new movie? This isn't something
from years ago?

31
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,370
WIL: From this year, yeah.

32
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,167
MATT: This episode sponsored by What We Do-- no,
I'm kidding.

33
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:42,599
ORION: Tomorrow, Friday, on Gather Your Party, I
had a thumbtack comedy buddy, Alex Lewis, and

34
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,826
Keith Habersberger--

35
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,428
MATT: That's not a real name.

36
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:53,637
ORION: I know. From Buzzfeed. Together, they are
Lewberger, and they're going to be playing here,

37
00:02:53,637 --> 00:03:00,699
and I'm going to be doing some songs with them and
performing with them, as well. Check it out for

38
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,154
Gather Your Party tomorrow. What time is that,
sorry Zac?

39
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:04,991
ZAC: 7:00PM.

40
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,041
ORION: 7:00PM.

41
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,461
MATT: Tomorrow. Wondrous.

42
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:11,274
LIAM: I would like to announce that I am nervous
as shit.

43
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,784
MATT: Why? I can't imagine why you would be.

44
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:18,192
WIL: Is it because you're sitting so close to me
that you're worried that you're not going to roll

45
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:19,398
anything well tonight?

46
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,768
LIAM: No. I should feel comfortable that you're
going to soak it all up.

47
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:26,363
WIL: Look, you're the regular. I'm the guest star.
I can die, and it's fine.

48
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,115
WILL: It's not fine.

49
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:33,405
WIL: It doesn't matter. No, it'll be dramatic and
great. I plan to sacrifice my life for someone in

50
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,041
this group who deserves it.

51
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,312
ZAC: Spoilers!

52
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:39,334
MARISHA: Hopefully you don't fail at that, too.

53
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:41,009
ALL: Oh!

54
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,034
WIL: Not for you!

55
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,156
WILL: Wow.

56
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,984
WIL: Not for you. No, not for you!

57
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:50,093
WILL: It's a hug-worthy moment. This is a good
day.

58
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:54,824
MARISHA: Only because of the dice, not because of
your choices.

59
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,297
WIL: Too late!

60
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:59,727
LIAM: Come on, guys. Just like we did in
rehearsals.

61
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,808
(laughter)

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:11,151
MARISHA: So 826LA, our charity. Everyone should go
check them out; they have amazing storefronts in

63
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:17,925
cities all across the country. The one here is
themed after time travel in Echo Park. And also in

64
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:25,446
Marina Del Rey; that's the other city that I'm
trying to think of. But yes, a portion of all of

65
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:30,624
our donations go to them, and they're amazing, so
thank you so much. And thank you for everyone who

66
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:35,476
has donated in the past. We love you. And I think
we are going to be doing a video. I know I've been

67
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:41,854
saying that for a while, but we have a date
scheduled now! It is happening. We have a way for

68
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:46,157
everyone to get back in town, but it's going to
happen, and we're going to have a field trip.

69
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:54,904
MATT: Yeah, to 826 and deliver all your wonderful
donations. Last announcement I have to make. Let's

70
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:59,004
see. The wonderful folks at Midnight Syndicate--
for those who don't know who they are, they make

71
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:05,736
fantastic music and soundtrack tracks. They've
done an official DND soundtrack years ago, and

72
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:11,966
they've done stuff for World of Darkness and Call
of Cthulhu. They do great atmospheric music. They

73
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:15,811
finally got back to me, and they gave me
permission to use their songs on this feed, so my

74
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:20,445
playlist expands even further. They're really
cool guys.

75
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,898
MARISHA: How long ago did you send that e-mail?

76
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,867
MATT: That was a while back. It was before we
started the stream. But they responded, and

77
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:30,479
they've been really cool about it, and if you're
looking for your own soundtrack stuff to work on,

78
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,103
they have a great array of stuff. I highly
recommend checking out Midnight Syndicate.

79
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,201
WILL: Are you still trying to get Queen, too?

80
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,245
MATT: I'm trying, but Freddie hasn't returned my
e-mails.

81
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:49,514
WIL: Hey, guys? This is weird. He's not going to
return your emails. No. He's not a fan.

82
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,012
LIAM: He's more into Shadowrun.

83
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,016
WIL: He's really a Shadowrun guy.

84
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,739
MATT: That's okay, Shadowrun's cool.

85
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,149
WIL: Very much a Shadowrun guy.

86
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,932
ORION: I played that on Genesis.

87
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:05,536
LIAM: We need to build bleachers back here. We've
got this thing.

88
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,170
MATT: We lost Wheaton.

89
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,528
WILL: All right, so now we got a shot!

90
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:19,403
LIAM: Well, step into camera if you're going to
make such a big to-do. Come in and say hi, and

91
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:23,209
then get out. You already pulled Wil out of the
picture.

92
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:27,721
MATT: Thorbir died really fast tonight. Yay, we
got a Laura!

93
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,818
WIL: And by the way, unlike Thorbir, I did not
trip over anything or fall down trying to go down

94
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:33,863
one step.

95
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,125
MATT: That's true.

96
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:40,567
WIL: Just so we don't mistake the actor for the
character.

97
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:46,552
MATT: Indeed. There's a distinction. It is a
creative character. No buckets were harmed in the

98
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:51,367
announcement here. All right, so. I think if we're
all ready, let's go ahead--

99
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,586
WIL: Oh, I don't have a pencil.

100
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,766
MATT: You don't have a pencil? I'm going to throw
a pencil at you.

101
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,294
WIL: Throw a pencil at me, dungeon master!

102
00:06:56,294 --> 00:07:00,460
MATT: I mean, gingerly hand it to our fantastic
overlord, who will deliver it.

103
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,343
MARISHA: Oh, are we going into our intro?

104
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:07,681
MATT: Yeah, so let's go ahead and get ready to
play ourselves some Critical Role.

105
00:07:07,681 --> 00:08:14,413
[dramatic music]

106
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:21,115
MATT: Welcome back. As we left off last time, to
give you a little backstory: Vox Machina, put into

107
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:24,989
some sort of legal trouble in the city of
Vasselheim, found themselves breaking a contract

108
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:28,949
for a guild called the Slayer's Take that was
essentially a monster hunters' guild, and all

109
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:36,043
kills near the city of this magnitude required
approval. So to make sure they weren't sent to the

110
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:41,071
seat of judgment to essentially be arrested and/or
tried for this infraction they didn't realize they

111
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:46,796
made, they were given the opportunity to actually
join the guild, which they chose to do. However,

112
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:51,694
as part of joining it, they had to go through a
small trial, in which the party was split and had

113
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:56,978
to go off to their own smaller contracts. One half
had journeyed through with our guests Mary

114
00:08:56,978 --> 00:09:03,459
Elizabeth McGlynn and Felicia Day, and they went
after a white dragon. They were awesome. Everyone

115
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:11,164
survived, barely. It was pretty rough. And this
adventuring party met as the second contract and

116
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:18,516
were given the task to seek out and destroy and
harvest pieces from a rakshasa, a demonic entity

117
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:24,549
that stems from the Nine Hells and apparently was
somewhere in the city masquerading as the

118
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:29,666
assistant to the owner of the Velvet Cabaret, an
establishment for upper-class pleasure-seekers.

119
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:38,149
The party, after essentially forcing this
individual to reveal themself, the rakshasa fled

120
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:45,490
through a tunnel underneath its room into a long
subterranean tunnel fraught with traps that were

121
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:52,153
set to protect it. The party managed to avoid
these rather deftly until the steady decline of

122
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:59,397
the hallway, combined with the increasing moisture
and scent of refuse, caused a slick surface, and

123
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:07,303
our fantastic cleric, Brother Kashaw, slipped and
fell down. Two party members, Keyleth and

124
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:11,053
Tiberius, decided it'd be a fun time to go
slip-n-sliding, joined him at the bottom of the

125
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:18,231
tunnel, where Thorbir and Vax stayed at the top,
shaking their heads with frustration. Upon

126
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:25,098
splashing down into what appeared to be some sort
of underground cistern or a collection of compost

127
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:31,261
and refuse that had been just rotting food and all
kinds of nasty stuff, the party pulled themselves

128
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:38,842
up, nearly waist-deep in this nasty substance.
Began to hear skittering and screeching sounds

129
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:45,204
throughout the room-- hundreds of small ones--
while two large thorny tentacles jettisoned out of

130
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:52,004
this, call it a dung heap if you want, and pulled
itself to the surface, with a central body filled

131
00:10:52,004 --> 00:11:02,599
with teeth and one giant toothy maw. And that was
where we left off. So. In the nature of that, I

132
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,301
would like everyone to roll initiative.

133
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:12,011
WIL: Even those of us that are very quietly
walking slowly? Okay.

134
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:18,097
MATT: You can continue slowly on your turn, if
you'd like. That's entirely up to you.

135
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:22,775
WILL: Natural 20! Plus two.

136
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,741
MARISHA: Good start.

137
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:27,330
ORION: I'll take it. That's 20 for me.

138
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,752
WIL: Well, I guess that just leaves me, then.

139
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,217
MARISHA: Come on, Wil.

140
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:33,295
WIL: Two.

141
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,770
(laughter)

142
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,846
MATT: And they're off!

143
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,073
WILL: We pick up where we left off.

144
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,448
LIAM: We never left.

145
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,781
WILL: MIT is just going, come on.

146
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:49,672
MATT: As a note, because I forgot, guys. For subs
tonight, every hundred subscribers we get, one

147
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:54,121
person in the chat will be chosen to win a signed
cast picture and a signed poster of one of our

148
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:57,672
artists, Kit Buss's wonderful art pieces for
Critical Role, signed by us, as well.

149
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:59,767
MARISHA: And Espionage Cosmetic nail wraps!

150
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:05,968
MATT: So we got some cool giveaways. Forgot that
at the top. Anyway. 20 and up?

151
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,425
WILL: 22.

152
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,915
ORION: 20.

153
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:15,847
MATT: All right. Ten to 15?

154
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,850
LIAM: 13.

155
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,948
MATT: 13? All right.

156
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:25,002
WIL: I don't know if you have numbers low enough.
Two.

157
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,344
MATT: Keyleth, what do you have?

158
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,463
MARISHA: Six.

159
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:38,146
MATT: Six, okay. All right. As the skittering
seems to go to a fervored frenzy, you can see masses

160
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:45,020
and masses of extremely matted fur moving and
quivering through this refuse as a series of rat

161
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,935
swarms pour out of the edges of this giant dung
pile. And where at the center that giant entity

162
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:58,330
has revealed itself to be a terrifying visage of
some kind. I'm going to have you go ahead and roll

163
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,535
an arcana check.

164
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,540
ORION: 22.

165
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:12,539
MATT: 22. Immediately, as soon as this creature
comes out (squelch), this horrible guttural

166
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:20,137
bubbling sound its throat makes as it pulls itself
out of this nasty collection of refuse. You've

167
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:23,934
read of this in quite a few tomes before in your
travels. This is known as an otyugh.

168
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,460
ORION: A what?

169
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,161
MATT: An otyugh.

170
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:30,972
ORION: Oh. Nasty things, these otyughs.

171
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:37,844
MATT: Usually riddled with disease, they're
controlled garbage disposals for those that can keep

172
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:42,350
control of them. And it is Kashaw's turn.

173
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,442
WILL: Do we get to know how dangerous they are to
us?

174
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,447
MATT: You currently have no idea.

175
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,171
WILL: Are these creatures dangerous to us?

176
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,223
ORION: Yes.

177
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:55,341
WILL: So should we just try to get rid of
everything right now, then, as it were?

178
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,422
ORION: They're not even there yet.

179
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,338
WILL: They're not with us at all yet, are they?

180
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:04,895
MATT: About 15 feet up, you can see the opening of
the tunnel where you guys slipped out, and you

181
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:09,044
have no visual sight of the rest of your party--
which, you guys were left in darkness, by the way.

182
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:12,298
You can see. You have dim light, so you're fine.

183
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:15,188
ORION: Whatever you do, don't go up next to it
right now.

184
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:21,901
WILL: Yeah, can I cast some light? Turn on some
light and see what we can see down there?

185
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,544
MATT: Well, he still has his Light spell.

186
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,713
WILL: Oh, we're still lit up? Oh, okay. Good.

187
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:29,403
MATT: You can see this creature now. (growls)

188
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:36,141
WILL: Okay. Now, is there any chance that any kind
of spell that I cast could hurt them, even though

189
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,694
we can't see where they are?

190
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:43,242
MATT: It depends on the spell's radius. If it's
relatively small, then probably not. They're not

191
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,621
even within visual range, so you'd really have to
try hard to hit them at this point.

192
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:50,716
WILL: And how about the rest of us, though? How
close are we to this thing and this cylinder?

193
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:56,105
MATT: You guys are all about ten feet away from this
giant creature right now.

194
00:14:56,162 --> 00:15:02,315
WILL: Yeah, that's a pretty tight thing. Okay. You
know what, I think I'm going to try to at least

195
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,600
slow this thing down as much as I can before
everybody else gets down here. I think that's the

196
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,064
best thing to do is just slow it down. I'd like to
cast Sacred Flame.

197
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,723
MATT: Sacred Flame.

198
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,255
WIL: Kash money.

199
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:14,267
MARISHA: (laughs) Kash money.

200
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:17,035
MATT: (laughs) Kash money. All right, so go ahead
and look at the spell.

201
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,928
What's it require from you?

202
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,133
WILL: Let's see, it's one action.

203
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:26,893
MATT: Okay, so the target makes a dexterity saving
throw. Let's see if it makes this. What is your

204
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,746
spell DC?

205
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,721
WILL: My spell DC?

206
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,490
MATT: Should be at the top of your spell list.

207
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:40,192
WILL: Where is that? Oh, I see what you're saying.
Yeah, okay. It's a 16.

208
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:44,727
MATT: 16. Okay, it does not make it. As you bring
out your holy symbol for a moment from beneath

209
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:48,955
your armor, you look forward and thrust your spear
forward. This energy travels from the middle of

210
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:54,706
your torso, across your arm, down the spear, and
fires off as this burst of vibrant whitish-blue

211
00:15:54,706 --> 00:16:01,829
light that blasts into the front of this otyugh
creature. You deal 3d8 damage to it. So go ahead

212
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,869
and roll eight-sided dice three times.

213
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,837
WILL: Eight. Now we need the full set, right?

214
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:08,900
MARISHA: Wait, they're all here. Here's an eight.

215
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,639
WILL: All right, I got the eight here.

216
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,047
WIL: If you need to roll a one, you can use one of
mine.

217
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:20,049
MARISHA: Wait, that's a ten. That's a ten-sider.
This one.

218
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:25,045
WILL: So three, right? Here we go.

219
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,423
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

220
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:28,844
WILL: That's all right. Eight and five and four.

221
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:29,919
MARISHA: That's really good.

222
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,474
MATT: Eight and five and four. 17 damage. (impact,
growling) You can see now it has the two giant

223
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:39,144
tentacles with these jagged spines that look
covered in whatever it's been climbing in and this

224
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:43,976
one central stalk that has eyes across it, and
the eyes flicker in pain and wince and then

225
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:48,545
focus in on you and looks across your companions.
Do you wish to move, or do you want to stay where

226
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:49,720
you are?

227
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,538
WILL: Yeah, I would like to move. Once I've
struck, I'd like to get at least a little bit

228
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:58,088
farther away from it to try to distract it from
the opening where these guys might be coming down,

229
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,673
so the opposite side of the opening where these
guys might drop in.

230
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:05,021
MATT: Okay, so you can try and move closer this
way, probably. You're now adjacent to one of the

231
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,560
rat swarms, but you're pulling it away from the
entrance here.

232
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,999
LIAM: Are they rats or are they ROUS's?

233
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:16,305
MATT: It looks like normal-sized rats. Not that
you would know, because you're not in the room,

234
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:20,718
but there's clusters and clusters of these rats
swarming over each other.

235
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:24,716
WILL: Were any of them affected at all by the
Sacred Flame?

236
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:27,712
MATT: No, it's just the singular target, but if
you have things that hit larger areas, they can

237
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:33,723
hit multiple guys. That ends your turn. Next up is
Tiberius.

238
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:35,703
ORION: I can move first, right?

239
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,792
MATT: You can, yes.

240
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:41,327
ORION: I'll move around next to Kashaw.

241
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,137
MATT: Next to him? Okay, you will get free strikes
from both the rat swarms, currently, because

242
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:48,279
you'll be passing through there and out of their
melee range. You cool with that?

243
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:58,079
ORION: No, I'm not. Can I take a step back?

244
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,317
MATT: You can. This guy will still get an attack
of opportunity on you.

245
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,586
ORION: Really? I thought I could move five feet.

246
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,631
MATT: You can use an action to disengage.

247
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:16,544
ORION: Okay. I won't do anything. Here's what I'm
going to do instead. I'm sorry, I don't know what

248
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:21,790
was wrong. I've been off, and I apologize for how
I've been sounding. What I'm going to do is I'm

249
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,683
going to lift my finger and I'm going to aim
behind that three-headed bastard and I'm going to

250
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:28,894
release a 4th-level Fireball.

251
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:30,940
MATT: Over here?

252
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,495
ORION: Yes.

253
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:36,258
MATT: Show me with your laser pointer where you
want the impact to be.

254
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:41,742
ORION: Behind him where it won't hurt Keyleth and
will just hurt him. Wherever that is.

255
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:44,874
MATT: Okay. I'd say that'd probably be right
around this area here.

256
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:55,172
ORION: I'm going to immediately spend two sorcery
points and quicken spell, and I'm going to turn

257
00:18:55,172 --> 00:19:03,944
around and do three Scorching Rays to follow up
the Fireball right at that dude, each head.

258
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,584
MATT: Okay.

259
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:14,762
ORION: I'm going to, on that spell, spend
another--

260
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,059
MATT: Wait up, let's do the Fireball first.

261
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,158
ORION: Okay.

262
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:27,072
MATT: One thing at a time. So as you use your
ring, you focus. The ray streaks past. Slams into

263
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:30,746
the wall behind (explosion sound) with a deafening
roar, and you guys definitely hear this. The

264
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:34,691
hallway in the distance suddenly brightens up, and
you can see a bit of flame roll up, and the scent

265
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:39,150
of smoke comes wafting past you as a wave of heat
blasts through the tunnel.

266
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,613
LIAM: Yeah, he does that.

267
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,311
MATT: What's the DC on your spells?

268
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,374
ORION: 17.

269
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:47,897
MATT: Does not make the save, so full damage on
the otyugh.

270
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:49,895
ORION: Wonderful, so let's see. Here's a six.

271
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:52,079
MATT: That rat swarm would also be hit.

272
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,961
ORION: Here's a five. Okay, so I'm going to now--

273
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,331
MATT: What's the damage on the Fireball?

274
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:03,495
ORION: Hold on, I'm going to spend one sorcery
point to empower the spell, and I'm going to pick

275
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:09,669
the six and reroll these four dice, because I can
reroll up to that many when I empower. For that

276
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:16,126
damage. Perfect. What's the total for that, guys?

277
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,721
MATT: (singing) Math. Wizard math.

278
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:22,473
WIL: Math has no power here.

279
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:27,582
LIAM: Math is for everybody, guys. Really.

280
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:36,250
ORION: What is that? Nine. That's 24. And then
(counting).

281
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,386
MATT: We're going to pimp out a calculator for him
one day.

282
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:39,600
MARISHA: Yes, abacus.

283
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,794
ORION: 48.

284
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:53,031
MATT: 48 points of damage. Boom. All right. Well.
After the fireball explosion settles, you can see

285
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:56,693
there's a big char mark in the front of it. Some
of its teeth have been blown into the inside of

286
00:20:56,693 --> 00:21:01,512
its mouth. The rat swarm behind Keyleth is
completely incinerated with a hundred-squeak

287
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:06,891
screeches, and you can smell charred fur and hair
and flesh in the air.

288
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,831
MARISHA: Oh, you burned my new robes! Ugh.

289
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:28,476
ORION: So I'm going to do that. Okay, and then the
Scorching Ray happens. And I'm going to heighten

290
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:35,333
that spell, which gives you disadvantage against
the save? Is that what I want to do? Yeah, that's

291
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,448
what I'm going to do.

292
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:39,728
LIAM: It feels like you just did 17 things.

293
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,617
MATT: Well, no. You have to make a ranged spell
attack for each one.

294
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:45,494
There is no saving throw for it.

295
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:49,333
ORION: Oh. Actually, I don't do that, then. I
don't spend those points. I was supposed to do

296
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,273
True Strike to make that work. d20s, right?

297
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,268
MATT: Yep, so roll for each ray.

298
00:21:55,268 --> 00:22:03,829
ORION: Wonderful. Yeah, they all hit. I got a 14,
an 18, a 19, and my

299
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,836
spell attack bonus is plus 11.

300
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:09,498
MATT: Okay. They all hit.

301
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,801
(laughter)

302
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:18,240
WIL: I saw that DM move of, I'll tell you if it
hits. I felt that.

303
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:27,214
MATT: It was there, and he was right. 6d6 fire
damage.

304
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:35,211
ORION: Ooh, that's gross, and I'm going to empower
that spell, as well. So it's four, and I'm going

305
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:52,211
to pick four out of these six-- no! I rolled a
six. (counts quietly) 29.

306
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:59,627
MATT: 29? All righty. As each ray (impact sounds),
you can see the flashing of the flaming light in

307
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:03,570
the air. This darkened room is suddenly
illuminated in bursts as each of these rays of

308
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,030
burning fire go blasting into the side of the
otyugh. It's nearly pushed back into the pile that

309
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,750
it pulled itself from, but steadies itself. Does
that end your turn?

310
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,293
ORION: Yes, it does.

311
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,379
MATT: All right. Tiberius's turn has come to an
end.

312
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:21,465
MARISHA: I've knitted a sweater while Tiberius
took his turn.

313
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:30,148
MATT: All right. Next up is the otyugh, who is
extremely unhappy with how that went down.

314
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:37,193
(growls) You now see as it pulls from the front of
its body one giant backwards-looking elephant leg

315
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:41,498
that steps into the front of the material, a
second one, forward. It pulls itself completely

316
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:46,723
out of the pile, and you can see a third one, like
a giant tripod. These thick legs carry it forward.

317
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:54,981
It is going to do a bite attack and a tentacle
attack on you, and a tentacle attack on Keyleth,

318
00:23:54,981 --> 00:24:01,987
as you're the nearest to it. So as it rears back
with its mouth, this giant maw opens with all

319
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:06,762
these nasty jagged broken teeth, and the smell
that comes out of its mouth is horrifying, even

320
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:15,905
for your experience as a dragonborn. That would
be... 18 to hit.

321
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:25,423
ORION: Did you roll at disadvantage?

322
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,423
MATT: Why would I have disadvantage?

323
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,359
ORION: Cloak of Displacement?

324
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,811
MATT: Oh! Good call. Oh, that's even higher. 19.
But thank you for the reminder;

325
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,029
that's good to know.

326
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:38,544
ORION: AC is 18.

327
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,824
MATT: So it hits.

328
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:42,951
LIAM: Now go home and get your shine box.

329
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:50,842
MATT: So as you're hanging back and your image is
shifting and shimmering nearby, its mouth is just

330
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:54,860
too big, and as it bites down, while it would have
partially hit the side, it manages to find your

331
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:01,564
proper location. The teeth clomp down onto you.
You take 16 points of piercing damage. As you

332
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:04,290
(grunts) reach back in pain, you push yourself out
of its mouth. I need you to make a constitution

333
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,291
saving throw.

334
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:14,900
ORION: 22.

335
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,079
MATT: 22. Okay, so you pull off and away. You can
see where it dragged across your scales, it left

336
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:27,090
this nasty trail of black-- whatever you would
call it, saliva-- but you manage to slip it off

337
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,614
your hand, and you feel like it's probably not
going to bother you too much. However, as you

338
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:36,622
steady yourself, one of the tentacles comes
swinging down towards you. That is also with

339
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:40,872
disadvantage. That would be a 21 to hit.

340
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,441
ORION: Yeah, that hits.

341
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:53,616
MATT: All right. You take seven points of
bludgeoning damage from the impact. That's only

342
00:25:53,616 --> 00:26:01,706
four points of piercing damage as the spines slam
into your side and seem to stick onto you. You are

343
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:06,470
also considered grappled and restrained for the
time, as the tentacle wraps around you and the

344
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,513
spines are digging into your body. It now has you
by your waist and is holding you in place.

345
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:16,240
ORION: This is fun. How much damage is that,
total?

346
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:18,446
MATT: That'd be a total of 11 damage.

347
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:21,540
ORION: Really? Plus the other damage?

348
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,696
MATT: Plus the bite, no. Did you not write down
the bite damage I told you?

349
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:28,097
ORION: That's 16, so 26? 27. So what's half of
that?

350
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:29,889
MATT: Half of that?

351
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,784
ORION: Because of the Stoneskin. My Stoneskin is
still up.

352
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:37,237
MATT: Stoneskin is still up. That is correct. How
long does that last?

353
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:38,709
ORION: Hour?

354
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:42,512
MATT: Hour. Yeah, that should've lasted long
enough. You're fine, yeah. So half of that

355
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:43,709
would've been--

356
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,115
ORION: I cast that when we were chasing him--

357
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:46,225
MATT: Yeah. 13 points of damage.

358
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:47,479
ORION: Okay. 13 points.

359
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:53,011
MATT: That was a lot of technicality in one turn.
Well done, Tiberius. All right.

360
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,700
WIL: Spellcasters.

361
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,949
MATT: That will be a 23 against you.

362
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,697
MARISHA: Yeah.

363
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:09,824
MATT: That turn's done. That'll be a total of 14
points of bludgeoning damage to you and five

364
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:13,611
points of piercing damage, and you are also
grappled by the other tentacles here. You are both

365
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:16,815
currently being held to the sides of the
creature.

366
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,516
MARISHA: 14 and five, you said?

367
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:22,086
MATT: Correct. That brings us to Vax.

368
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:24,533
LIAM: We're how high up from here?

369
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:26,886
MATT: About 15 feet up, and you're that far back.

370
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:30,062
LIAM: We're that far back? All right, so it takes
my whole movement just to run to the edge

371
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:31,461
probably, yeah?

372
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:37,200
MATT: (counting) Yeah, pretty close, right there.
That's your turn?

373
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,458
LIAM: And that's it? Bonus action, right?

374
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,170
MATT: Bonus action if you want it, yeah.

375
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,960
LIAM: But I can't see. Can I see past the lip of
the edge to the top of that?

376
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,261
MATT: Whatever you're trying to hit might have
three-quarters cover.

377
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:49,500
LIAM: (sighs) That's it.

378
00:27:49,500 --> 00:28:01,098
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Now the swarms.
Moving in. Each one of these rats swarms start

379
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,579
crawling up towards your body, and they're
starting to find their way into your armor, and

380
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:12,530
they're biting. It's a terrible experience. Swarm
attacking Keyleth is going to be a 16 to hit.

381
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,687
MARISHA: Nope.

382
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:16,166
MATT: Nope. You brush them off yourself.

383
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:19,959
MARISHA: I look at them and I go, (rat noises).

384
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:26,019
MATT: (laughs) The rat whisperer. Attacking you,
Brother Kash. That looks like it's going to be a

385
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:28,277
ten to hit?

386
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,829
WILL: Okay, so now what?

387
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:31,117
MATT: What's your armor class?

388
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:34,706
WILL: My armor class is where? There. It's 20.

389
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:38,263
MATT: 20. These rats come forward and you (whack)
knock them out of the way with your shield.

390
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:44,202
Against Tiberius, that is going to be, with
disadvantage--

391
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:47,354
ORION: Man, they can't touch me. I'm up in the
air, yo.

392
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:49,771
MATT: You're grappled, but you're not floating in
the air.

393
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,028
ORION: Aw man, I thought he was whipping me
around.

394
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:51,973
MATT: Not yet.

395
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:54,042
MARISHA: (laughs) Not yet.

396
00:28:54,042 --> 00:29:00,164
MATT: That's going to be a 13, so it's going to
miss you. So the rats, no effect yet. That ends

397
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:01,789
their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

398
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:11,301
MARISHA: I take the tentacle that's grappled
around me and I grab onto it, and I cast Blight.

399
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:16,469
MATT: All right.

400
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,450
MARISHA: It has to make a constitution saving
throw.

401
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,525
MATT: What level is Blight? Blight is 4th?

402
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:26,824
MARISHA: 3rd.

403
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:32,775
MATT: All right, constitution saving throw. That
is an 11. What's your DC?

404
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,513
I'm pretty sure it fails.

405
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:35,970
MARISHA: 18.

406
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,821
MATT: Okay, it takes 8d8 necrotic damage. Go ahead
and roll damage.

407
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,342
MARISHA: Yes, it does.

408
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:41,711
WILL: Nice work.

409
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:44,214
MARISHA: Where'd all my d8s go?

410
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:47,366
WILL: You gave them to me. You very nicely gave
them to me.

411
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:57,857
MARISHA: Here's one. Ooh, there's four, so five,
six. Seven. I just like rolling all of them I

412
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:23,524
could roll. Okay. That's all right. There's ten,
there's 20, there's 35. Sorry. Yes, 36 damage.

413
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,318
MATT: 36 damage.

414
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:26,266
MARISHA: Yes.

415
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:33,541
MATT: Nice! As you grab the tentacle, you can see
the slippery, slimy flesh, and it has the residue

416
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:38,323
on it. As your fingers grasp into it, its
brownish-yellow color all of a sudden turns into

417
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:44,325
this grayish sickly dried landscape, as you can
see the flesh cracking to dust around it. The

418
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:49,532
tentacle's still grasping onto you. The magical
energy travels up the side of what would be its

419
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:53,873
torso and body, and you can see it beginning to
withdraw through severe pain. It manages to

420
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:59,952
eventually shrug off any further spread of the
magical disease, of the Blight, but it has left

421
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:06,689
this horrible scarring across one side of its
whole body. You can't really move this turn, since

422
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,150
you're currently restrained.

423
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,308
MARISHA: It's fine.

424
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:15,693
MATT: Yep. All right. That brings us to Thorbir.
What you got?

425
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:21,786
WIL: I'm going to continue down this corridor to
get close to the half-elf.

426
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:26,191
MATT: That's a full round of movement there.

427
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:29,712
WIL: That's all I can do. Leave something for me!

428
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:35,434
MATT: All right, that ends that. That's going to
bring us to the top. Kashaw. Your turn.

429
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:40,465
WILL: Is the side that she damaged useless at this
point? The one tentacle?

430
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:45,074
MATT: No, it's still functional, still wrapped
around her. There's scarring across it and a large

431
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:51,381
part of its upper torso. Torso. It's weird to say
parts of its body when it has that strange

432
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:52,705
construction.

433
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:57,279
WIL: Don't attach your body norms to it, man.

434
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,533
MATT: (laughs) I apologize.

435
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:03,127
LIAM: Are you body-shaming that otyugh?

436
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:13,791
WILL: Shouldn't we? I'd like to move as much
directly in front of the creature as possible.

437
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:19,718
MATT: Okay. That'll get you there. That one rat
swarm does get a free attack on you as you move

438
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:26,300
past it. That is going to be an 11. You can see
the rats swarming up your legs and trying to get

439
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,993
past, but the armor's too thick and the chain
mail's too strong underneath the plate you have,

440
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:34,902
and you brush them off as you move to the side.
Pulls you right up in front of it, now. Its giant

441
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:40,626
mouth is (chomping sounds) angrily gnashing and
biting down in front of you, and it's sending bits

442
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:46,740
of that brackish spittle across your face and
smells horrifying. What are you doing?

443
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:56,568
WILL: I'd like to try to take control of it with
Geas. See if I can tell this bitch what to do.

444
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,671
MARISHA: Do it!

445
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,108
WILL: Not you.

446
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:03,540
MARISHA: I was hoping you weren't talking about
me.

447
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,334
WILL: I'd never call you bitch.

448
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,859
MATT: Okay, the casting time for Geas is one
minute.

449
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,977
WILL: Okay.

450
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:16,700
MATT: Knowing that, every combat round is
equivalent to six seconds, so you could try it. It

451
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,226
probably won't survive that long, but hold onto
that spell for now. Is there another one you'd

452
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:24,499
like to use?

453
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:40,754
WILL: I will hold onto that. Yeah. I think then
I'm going to try... How about just another Sacred

454
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,315
Flame for now?

455
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:48,128
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll to attack, sir. No,
this one it just makes its saving throw. I forgot.

456
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:53,538
All right, cool. It's going to attempt at making
another dexterity saving throw. That is a 14, and

457
00:33:53,538 --> 00:34:02,356
that does not beat it, so go ahead and roll 3d8
points of damage to it. Radiant damage. Tiberius,

458
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:03,670
you're on deck.

459
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,127
MARISHA: Oh, nice. Not bad.

460
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,135
WILL: 16.

461
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:12,922
MATT: 16 points of damage, nice. Yes. (impact
sounds) Once again, the flames burst up, and you

462
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:18,256
can see parts of its body where the scarring is
across it all of a sudden explode with light, and

463
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:25,434
beneath you can see the freshly exposed
grayish-brown fleshy muscle beneath its outer

464
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:33,441
armored structure. It is looking a little rough.
That ends your turn. That brings us to Tiberius.

465
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:54,338
ORION: He's got me like this, right? Yeah, sure.
I'm going to cast True Strike on him. Cantrip.

466
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,155
MATT: True Strike on yourself?

467
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,313
ORION: On him.

468
00:34:57,313 --> 00:34:58,356
MATT: On him.

469
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:04,533
ORION: I'm going to look for a weakness. That'll
give me advantage on my next--

470
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:07,343
MATT: Attack roll against the target? Okay.

471
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:17,462
ORION: Then I'm going to quicken spell and spend
two more sorcery points to cast-- well, I'm going

472
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,960
to look over. Can I see where Vax and him are
coming?

473
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,806
MATT: Currently, no. There is so much going on in
the room, and the only light source is you right

474
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:29,224
now. You have no inclination that they're even at
the top at this point, and you're currently

475
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:34,100
wrapped in a tentacle and being swarmed by rats.
You have no way of telling that they've even

476
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,550
arrived at this point.

477
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,457
ORION: I can see behind the creature, though,
because that's within range. So I will do Misty

478
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,398
Step behind him and get out of that grip.

479
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:51,667
MATT: All righty. Misty Step is a 2nd-level?

480
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:52,801
ORION: Yes.

481
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,414
MATT: All right. To where do you want to go?

482
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,353
ORION: As far away behind him as I can go.

483
00:35:58,353 --> 00:35:59,554
MATT: There you go.

484
00:35:59,554 --> 00:36:01,165
ORION: And that is my turn.

485
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:09,624
MATT: All righty. Ending your turn, the otyugh
turns around angrily. Now it looks, it has its

486
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:20,860
empty tendril. It's going to step away. You do get
one, Brother Kash, as it steps away. You get one

487
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,184
free attack with your spear as it tries to move
away from you.

488
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,446
WILL: Okay.

489
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,760
MATT: So go ahead and roll an attack with your
spear.

490
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,616
WILL: That is a d20? 14.

491
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,683
MATT: Plus your attack bonus.

492
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:35,110
WILL: Attack bonus is--

493
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,722
MARISHA: Oh, plus nine.

494
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:40,864
MATT: Oh, that definitely hits. So go ahead and
roll damage for the spear.

495
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,668
WILL: Damage for the spear?

496
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,806
MARISHA: Which is 1d8 plus three.

497
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:50,871
WILL: 1d8 plus three. Where's my d8? Ten.

498
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:58,302
MATT: So as it moves away (stomping sounds) you
reach out and (whoosh) hit it with the spear,

499
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:03,310
leaving this big old gaping wound in the side
where more of its dark blood begins to spill out

500
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:09,340
from the wound. As it moves over, it's going to go
ahead and do one bite attack towards Keyleth with

501
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,124
its open mouth. That's going to be a 24.

502
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:15,324
MARISHA: That hits.

503
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:26,622
MATT: All right. That's going to be 16 points of
piercing damage to you, and make a constitution

504
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:29,591
saving throw.

505
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:31,862
MARISHA: 16.

506
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:38,154
MATT: 16. You can feel the diseased liquid that
fills the inside of the otyugh's mouth begin to

507
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:44,605
pulse into your arm for a second. You tense, and
eventually the pain and numbness tends to fade

508
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:51,028
within a few seconds. However, as you take that
moment to yourself, as it's still grabbing you

509
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:54,595
with the one tentacle, it's going to reach and
attack twice towards Tiberius.

510
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:59,814
That is going to be a 16?

511
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:01,127
ORION: Nope.

512
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:05,248
MATT: Okay. That'll be a 19.

513
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,225
ORION: Yes.

514
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:17,354
MATT: So the second one hits you. That is eight
points of bludgeoning damage and five points, so

515
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:24,153
13. Half that because of Stoneskin. That puts you
at seven points of damage. And you are once again

516
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:26,063
grappled and wrapped up by it.

517
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:28,150
ORION: I think he likes me!

518
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,282
MATT: I think you pissed it off when you set it on
fire multiple times in a row.

519
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,398
WILL: We could use a little help down here!

520
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,774
LIAM: Coming!

521
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:36,604
MATT: That ends its turn. Vax, you're up.

522
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:40,762
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to run up to the edge of it.
Are any of my friends

523
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,707
right up against this nasty shit?

524
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:45,200
MATT: Currently, Keyleth is right next to it.

525
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,894
LIAM: Keyleth. So if it's occupied with my friend,
I can take a second, aim really well, and sneak

526
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:56,813
attack from up here. Okay, so that is 24.

527
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,914
MATT: 24? That hits, definitely.

528
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:00,541
LIAM: All right, so sneak attack.

529
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:05,292
MARISHA: Oh good, you showed up!

530
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:26,159
LIAM: That's a two plus nine. This is Keen Dagger.
Nine. Plus 12, 17, 21. That's 21. 30.

531
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,777
MATT: 30 points of damage. All right.

532
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:33,604
LIAM: And the second dagger, which is
Life-Stealing, hits with a 24.

533
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,018
MATT: That hits, definitely.

534
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:37,248
LIAM: That is eight.

535
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:42,636
MATT: Eight. All right. You still have the rest of
your movement if you want to stay up there or wish

536
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:44,347
to move somewhere.

537
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:49,155
LIAM: Nope, just going to perch.

538
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:51,265
MATT: Okay, cool. All right.

539
00:39:51,265 --> 00:40:01,780
MATT: Ending Vax's turn, the rats now move up.
This one is going to go there, attacking Keyleth.

540
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,795
You are currently restrained. Tiberius, you are
also restrained, so attacks against you have

541
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:12,066
advantage. That'll be a 19 against you.

542
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:13,483
MARISHA: Yeah.

543
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:18,041
MATT: Against Tiberius, it just has a general
attack roll because you give it disadvantage on

544
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:30,733
attacks. That is going to be a 17, which I think
misses you. All right. Keyleth, you take nine

545
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:35,848
points of piercing damage as the rats are now
swarming up over the side of the tentacle and

546
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:39,074
biting at your neck and shoulder area, and you're
trying to brush them off of you.

547
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:42,351
MARISHA: No! (squeaking noises)

548
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:46,156
MATT: Rats aren't your friends anymore. That
finishes their turn. It is now your turn,

549
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:47,265
Keyleth.

550
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:51,341
MARISHA: My turn? Okay, are rats swarming me?

551
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:52,612
MATT: Yep.

552
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:58,732
MARISHA: This guy's looking pretty close to dead,
yeah?

553
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:02,149
MATT: He's looking pretty hurt.

554
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:08,959
MARISHA: He's looking pretty hurt? I'm going to do
it again. I'm going to do Blight again.

555
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,552
MATT: Blight again against this guy?

556
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,223
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm still grappled, right?

557
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:13,371
MATT: You are, yes.

558
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:18,629
MARISHA: So just same thing, I'm just going to
(sucking sound) try and

559
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:20,328
suck the life out of this guy.

560
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:21,725
MATT: All right.

561
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:23,334
MARISHA: Constitution saving throw.

562
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:27,172
MATT: That is going to be a 13.

563
00:41:27,172 --> 00:41:43,661
MARISHA: (laughs, counts) I need one more, where's
it at? Big money, no whammies. Ooh, that's not

564
00:41:43,661 --> 00:42:02,600
bad. Okay, so that's 14, 15, 16, 24, 30, 32, 35,
41, 45.

565
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,358
MATT: 45 points of damage from Blight. So this
time, as the rats are swarming over you, you reach

566
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,111
up your hands. They're glowing with the energy
that you're drawing from this. You can see the

567
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,948
actual air around her hands beginning to turn
black and the air is beginning to be pulled in.

568
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:21,310
What was once a very moist and warm vicinity gets
strangely cold as now her hands embody the end of

569
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:28,918
life. She grasps the tentacle, and the rats
scatter as the proximity grows. As you touch it,

570
00:42:28,918 --> 00:42:34,467
you can see now what was once the Blight's
scarring begins to fill the entire tentacle, and as

571
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:38,410
it turns, it hardens around you, almost like a
brittle piece of concrete. The rest of its body

572
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:44,462
(cracking) you see it begins to (roars), starts
thrashing about. Its tendril releases you,

573
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:48,864
Tiberius, dropping you into a pile of refuse. As
it reaches around to try and grasp its own

574
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:54,010
tentacle, (shattering sound) it breaks through its
own arm. As it reels back, you fall onto your

575
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:59,053
butt, the rest of the broken pieces of otyugh
crumbling into dust around you. You look up and

576
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:02,718
see the creature as it attempts to back up, each
one of its legs pulling up against the one door

577
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:07,108
that's partially buried in the far corner. It
slams into the side as the Blight spreads across

578
00:43:07,108 --> 00:43:11,086
its body. Its teeth begin to shatter and turn to
dust within its mouth, which begins to slowly curl

579
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:17,236
inward as it ages extremely rapidly in a short
period of time. Suddenly, it slumps to the ground,

580
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:22,113
(gurgling sound) and joins the refuse of which it
once came from.

581
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:23,661
MARISHA: Dead?

582
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:28,072
MATT: Thorbir?

583
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,923
WIL: You were supposed to save something for me!

584
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,845
ORION: There's a bunch of rats down here!

585
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:35,980
WIL: Rats!

586
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,365
WILL: Walk faster.

587
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:45,532
WIL: (clunk clunk) To the edge, there. How far
down is it?

588
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:47,663
MATT: 15 feet. And it is soft ground.

589
00:43:47,663 --> 00:43:50,171
WIL: Can I jump and land on those rats?

590
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:53,108
MATT: You know what? Sure. Go ahead and make an
athletics check.

591
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:58,340
MARISHA: Come on. You can do it.

592
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:07,147
WIL: Okay. 17.

593
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,608
MARISHA: It's rats!

594
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:19,683
MATT: You leap, slam down on top of the rat swarm
that just jettisoned off the side of Keyleth. I'm

595
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:24,327
going to say for that impact, go ahead and roll
1d6. It takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from you

596
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:26,415
stepping on a few of the rats.

597
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,454
WIL: Six.

598
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:31,626
MATT: Six! All righty. And they're now all around
you on the ground and they're trying to swarm away

599
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,640
from the impact zone. You still have your action.

600
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,626
WIL: Okay, so. I haven't played a character this
high-level in this system, so bear with me while I

601
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:44,473
walk through this. I believe that I can attack
three times in a round, right? I have the extra

602
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,047
attack feature?

603
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:48,109
MATT: Yes, as a fighter, you do. You have three
attacks.

604
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:57,413
WIL: Okay, so I'm going to take my axe and just
try to kill as many of these things as I possibly

605
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,764
can. So I swing my axe.

606
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:06,029
MATT: All right.

607
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:11,763
WIL: And I roll a two.

608
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:16,484
MATT: All right, you swing your axe for the first
batch of rats. Unfortunately, it's hard to see

609
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:22,817
where the compost pile and the rats separate. You
cleave through a bunch of the slimy mess, slinging

610
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:29,330
a bunch of it against the wall, and as you spatter
a bit against Keyleth, who's behind you. Roll for

611
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,597
your next attack.

612
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:39,189
WIL: Very unhappy about that. Okay, three. How's
that hole looking? It's a great hole, right?

613
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:44,296
MATT: You decide, as opposed to a small swath,
let's make it a wider one, and your axe swings

614
00:45:44,296 --> 00:45:49,051
again. This time you catch a singular rat, but
with the flat of the blade, and you send it flying

615
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:51,990
about ten feet, where it comes back unharmed and
joins the rest of its crew.

616
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,546
WIL: Just getting warmed up! And a one.

617
00:45:56,546 --> 00:46:02,089
WILL: It can't be real! It can't be real.

618
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:05,952
LIAM: That is CG. That is computer-generated.

619
00:46:05,952 --> 00:46:14,555
MATT: This time, in an angry fury that you are
being stifled by what is essentially sewer rats,

620
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:19,000
you lift your axe up in the air as one rat has
climbed up your pants

621
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,380
bites you right in the crotch.

622
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,898
WIL: Don't touch it, don't do that. Okay. Yes, it
does.

623
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:28,250
MATT: In pain, you drop the axe behind you and
reach down and grab the rat and tear it in half

624
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,458
out of frustration and anger, and I will give you
a point of damage for that.

625
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:35,552
WIL: A point of damage? The rat bit through my
metal codpiece?

626
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:43,613
MATT: It snuck up past the small little gap there
and ate through your leather britches, and you are

627
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:46,673
in severe pain, nearing prone.

628
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:50,961
WIL: Well, I mean us dwarves are known for our
dicks that are sensitive to rat bites.

629
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:54,836
MATT: This is true. They didn't put that in the
Player's Handbook, but I think they're going to

630
00:46:54,836 --> 00:46:55,930
amend it, too.

631
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,481
WIL: Oh, it's canon in my game.

632
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,206
MATT: And with that, Thorbir's turn is up.

633
00:47:01,206 --> 00:47:04,653
WIL: Yeah, it sure is. Excuse me, I must inform
the internet of my majesty.

634
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:08,744
LIAM: You got your dick bit by a rat, son. You're
a man now.

635
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:10,614
WILL: (laughs) You're a man now.

636
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:15,098
MATT: Every dwarf, when they hit the tender age of
30, has to wander waist-deep into the rat pits.

637
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,124
All right. Kashaw, you're up.

638
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:23,282
WILL: First I would like to turn to Thorbir and
say, are you kidding me?! How many rats are left?

639
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:28,213
MATT: You have the group that is currently
swarming around Thorbir, one immediately to your

640
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:31,691
left that you're batting away with your shield,
and one group that is currently trying to get all

641
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:33,405
up in Tiberius's shit.

642
00:47:33,405 --> 00:47:36,281
WILL: Can we tell who's in the most danger at this
point?

643
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:41,156
MATT: For the most part, everyone seems to be
doing okay. He's looking the roughest from a

644
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:42,640
situational--

645
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,298
MARISHA: That's just a bruised ego. That's
different.

646
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:54,624
WILL: Yeah. I think I would like to move to come
to Strongcastle's defense over here.

647
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:55,996
ORION: Stormwind.

648
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:56,976
WILL: Right.

649
00:47:56,976 --> 00:48:04,802
MATT: All right, so. There we go. The rats do get
a swing at you. That is going to be-- that's not

650
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:08,166
going to hit. Once again, you hear the little
small tings against the back of your armor, but

651
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:11,609
it's not even a bother at this point. All right,
what are you doing? You move up to the rats.

652
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:17,492
WILL: Once again, because again, people, I need
some help. I'm a healer for god's sakes, so I'm

653
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:19,438
going to try Sacred Flame again.

654
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:23,519
MATT: All right, which I'm going to say you stayed
a step back on, because it's a ranged attack. So

655
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:29,335
you get real close, once again set your spear down
real fast, grab your holy symbol, and then release

656
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,939
that burst. Go ahead and roll for attack.
Actually, no, it's a saving throw again. That's my

657
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:45,489
end. The rats roll a one. Go ahead and roll
straight damage on that. It's 3d8.

658
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,386
WILL: Oh, the 3d8s. That's right. I'm sorry.

659
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:48,370
MATT: It's all good.

660
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,111
WILL: Here are the d8s, right?

661
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:52,662
WIL: You know, if you're me, you only have to roll
once.

662
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:57,098
WILL: That's not that great. Eight.

663
00:48:57,098 --> 00:49:03,577
MATT: Eight points of damage. You release it and
you can see about 13, 14 rats get thrown and

664
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:09,586
scattered, their lifeless burnt corpses (pattering
sound) around, and the little hole that you left

665
00:49:09,586 --> 00:49:16,995
in the middle of that pile closes up as the rats
form once again into a coalesced swarm. That

666
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:20,989
ends your turn, I believe. That'll bring us to
Tiberius.

667
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:23,133
MARISHA: Kill some rats.

668
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:26,089
ORION: What the hell are we in?

669
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:30,652
MATT: It's a giant cylindrical-- it looks like it
was once a cistern that has been turned into some

670
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:32,034
sort of a refuse--

671
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,403
ORION: Is there a roof?

672
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,895
MATT: From what you can see? Roll a perception
check.

673
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:43,405
ORION: What do I use?

674
00:49:43,405 --> 00:49:48,337
MATT: Perception. It's a skill. You don't use it
very often.

675
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:49,770
ORION: 15. No, 14.

676
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:54,798
MATT: As far as you can see, it goes up maybe 30
or so feet beyond the radius of your Light spell

677
00:49:54,798 --> 00:49:58,999
and fades into darkness. You have no idea if
there's a ceiling or end to it or how far it would

678
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,432
be if there was one.

679
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:05,047
ORION: Okay. Well, I've got one right next to me,
right?

680
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:06,310
MATT: You do.

681
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:21,910
ORION: I'm going to put out my hand and I'm going
to do a Firebolt right next to that one.

682
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,210
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll to attack with
disadvantage.

683
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:30,380
ORION: Why, are they on me?

684
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,562
MATT: Yeah, they're right up against you. Ranged
attacks, when you're in melee with the target,

685
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:37,234
it's at disadvantage.

686
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:50,098
ORION: Oh, right. Well, then I'm going to not do
that. I'm going to cast Obelisk of Stone and then

687
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:53,877
quicken spell and then I'm going to do a Firebolt.
That's what I'm going to do.

688
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,177
MATT: Okay.

689
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,366
ORION: Yeah.

690
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:59,394
WIL: Avenge me!

691
00:50:59,394 --> 00:51:04,053
MATT: Obelisk of Stone puts you up on top there.

692
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:09,403
ORION: About ten feet. And then I'll do the 2d10
damage.

693
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:10,867
MATT: All righty.

694
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,607
ORION: d10s. Here's one.

695
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:15,360
WILL: All right, I think I have one.

696
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,104
MATT: Roll to hit first.

697
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:21,663
ORION: Is it a d10? Do what now? Roll to hit
first?

698
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,577
LIAM: You need d10s.

699
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:35,819
ORION: Yes, thank you. Is that a spell attack
roll? That's 31.

700
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:40,380
MATT: 31? Yeah, that hits. Swarm of rats: not too
hard to hit, really.

701
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,266
ORION: Cool, so that's 11, so that's 16.

702
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:55,618
MATT: 16? All right. You lift up onto your
ten-foot platform as this stone pushes up from

703
00:51:55,618 --> 00:52:02,676
beneath all of the slime, and as it emerges, it
sends this spilling cluster of whatever was at the

704
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:15,580
bottom of this. You have to keep your footing as
you go up. In fact, because of this room, I'm

705
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,112
going to go ahead and have you roll a dexterity
saving throw.

706
00:52:19,112 --> 00:52:25,499
ORION: What is that, 12?

707
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:32,040
MATT: 12. So you get the attack off, but you lose
your footing from the slick nature of the obelisk

708
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,941
you just created, and you will plummet off and
fall prone into the refuse to the side of the

709
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:42,658
obelisk, but you still get the damage off on the
spell. As you blast-- whoa-- and Tiberius, you

710
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:46,779
tumble off the side. It's a soft impact. You only
fall ten feet. It doesn't do any damage, but you

711
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:48,856
are currently prone on the ground next to your
obelisk.

712
00:52:48,856 --> 00:52:50,769
LIAM: Refuse is code for shit.

713
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:58,160
MATT: I believe that ends your turn. You haven't
moved yet, so you could technically use your

714
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,170
movement to get up from prone if you wanted.

715
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,497
ORION: Oh, I'll do that.

716
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:06,402
MATT: Okay. Cool, that ends your turn. He's gone.
Vax, you're up.

717
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:13,475
LIAM: I'm staying safe up here. I'm going to throw
more daggers. There's a little pile under

718
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:16,733
Thorbir's hiney? And a little bit out by itself,
right?

719
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:17,756
MATT: Right here, yes.

720
00:53:17,756 --> 00:53:20,698
LIAM: Are they spilling out from under the dwarf's
hiney? Or are they all hidden?

721
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,344
MATT: No, they're all around him. They're sharing
the same space.

722
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:32,651
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to throw daggers at the one
that's biting his ass, so it's a sneak attack.

723
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:34,797
That's not good. That's 13.

724
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:36,282
MATT: So a 13, that hits.

725
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:37,350
LIAM: Oh hey, rats.

726
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,902
MATT: Rats are easy to hit.

727
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:39,943
LIAM: Oh, right.

728
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:41,181
WIL: No, they're not.

729
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:42,376
(laughter)

730
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:44,097
WILL: Usually, they are.

731
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:54,034
LIAM: That's two plus seven is nine, plus 11, 12,
17, 18, 19, 21 is the first dagger, and I send the

732
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:59,250
next one down. If the last one hit, this one hits.
So that's 21 and the second dagger

733
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,271
is a ten, so 31.

734
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:10,186
MATT: 31 damage total? All right. You notice that
because of the nature of the swarm, what would

735
00:54:10,186 --> 00:54:14,319
normally be a creature that you could do a
shit-ton of damage to, knowing its physicality, it

736
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,893
seems like a lot of the physical attacks aren't as
effective as you would like. However, this swarm

737
00:54:18,893 --> 00:54:22,417
has already taken a few hits, and as you carve
through, dagger after dagger, eventually you pick

738
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:27,981
off the remainder of the rats and the swarm is
dissipated. The few ones that are stragglers,

739
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:33,564
realizing that safety in numbers is missing, begin
to curl their ways back underneath the piles they

740
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,162
clawed from originally.

741
00:54:35,162 --> 00:54:37,578
WIL: I was doing fine.

742
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:43,097
MATT: That ends your turn? At the end of your
turn, the other two rat swarms, also realizing

743
00:54:43,097 --> 00:54:47,968
the circumstance is bad, fight-or-flight kicks in and they
flee and crawl back underneath.

744
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,483
MARISHA: Smart rats.

745
00:54:49,483 --> 00:54:51,138
LIAM: Cheese!

746
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:59,434
WILL: (Mickey Mouse voice) Haha! I think I'm going
to flee. Let's all swarm, come on, we can do it.

747
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:03,588
MATT: So you all take a moment, take your breath.
You get back up.

748
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:11,806
LIAM: I'm going to hop down in the shit and loop
an arm under Thorbir's arm. Come on, old man.

749
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:14,369
WILL: How's your dick?

750
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:16,357
WIL: I don't want to talk about it.

751
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:18,621
ORION: I Prestidigitate all the crap off.

752
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:20,061
MATT: Okay.

753
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,040
WILL: Is she still on the ground, or has she
gotten up?

754
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,278
MATT: You've gotten back up. She's still
spattered--

755
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:28,285
WILL: You ruined your new dress.

756
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:32,496
MARISHA: I know. I got scorched by Tiberius's
fireball.

757
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,677
WILL: You fought well, though.

758
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:39,340
WIL: I'm looking for the way out of here. I'm
looking to see where the rakshasa went.

759
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:45,197
MATT: Looking on the far side, it's partially
buried in the ground from the collection here, but

760
00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:49,226
you can see there is a bit of a push, like the
door had been opened briefly and pushed things

761
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,801
away, then slammed shut, and it's slowly starting
to coalesce back towards it.

762
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:57,658
LIAM: All right. Hold on, everybody. I walk right
toward it, perception checking the area around it

763
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:00,535
and the door itself. That's 24.

764
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:09,272
MATT: 24? The door appears to be a normal door.
Nothing strange about its presentation. However,

765
00:56:09,272 --> 00:56:13,161
upon checking the handle on the edge of it, it
does appear to be locked.

766
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:18,440
LIAM: Locked. All right, well, I pull out my
little sack and I pull out one of these (twing)

767
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,001
and go to work on it. That is a 28.

768
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:30,520
MATT: 28. In a matter of seconds-- this is an
old-school lock, and one that is generally used

769
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:39,140
for not very security-required rooms. Flick of the
wrist, (click, creak) the door pushes inward a

770
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:46,636
little bit and you have to get your strength in to
push back the cluster of dried and liquid plant

771
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:51,085
matter that is rotting against it, with just
enough of a gap to push through into a dark room

772
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,305
beyond, it looks like.

773
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:53,601
LIAM: I Fonzie'd it.

774
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:54,931
MATT: You did, kind of.

775
00:56:54,931 --> 00:56:57,699
LIAM and MARISHA: (Fonzie impressions) Hey.

776
00:56:57,699 --> 00:57:00,675
LIAM: Okay, Tiberius, are you still lighting up
this room?

777
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:02,792
MATT: He is currently the only light source, yes.

778
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:05,860
LIAM: Okay, so there's probably a little bit of
light going in there, so I'm trying to look in to

779
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,229
see what I can see from his spill-in there.

780
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:18,585
MATT: Okay. Glancing into the next room, you can
see there's a little bit of a trickle of liquid

781
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:22,207
that has spilled from underneath the doorway from
this room. And you get the feeling this door isn't

782
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:27,274
open very often, if at all, and the little bit of
slime that has coasted through only goes about

783
00:57:27,274 --> 00:57:33,989
five, ten feet into a long stone hallway that
disappears in the darkness no more than maybe 20

784
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:37,267
feet from you. Even with the low light, you can
see pretty far. To the right and left of you,

785
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,785
though: sets of iron bars.

786
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:49,558
LIAM: Okay. Tibs. Follow that. Try and keep behind
me. And I throw up the hood and go as low to the

787
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:56,031
ground as I can, and I start to Gollum along the
floor, looking at the ground in front of me in the

788
00:57:56,031 --> 00:57:58,657
dim light, trying to see if I can see any traps
ahead of me.

789
00:57:58,657 --> 00:58:01,966
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

790
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,317
LIAM: 25.

791
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:08,077
MATT: 25. As you begin walking into the hallway,
you go past, and you start to notice from the

792
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:15,228
visual around you, there's smooth stone floor. The
iron bars are all the way across with some

793
00:58:15,228 --> 00:58:22,175
partitions between. This is in particular a
subterranean holding facility, some sort of an

794
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:32,455
underground prison, and it's very quiet and there
is no light in here. There are sconces set up, but

795
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:35,272
it looks like there have been no recent torches
set.

796
00:58:35,272 --> 00:58:36,818
LIAM: Hear anything?

797
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:40,339
MATT: Hearing? You hear nothing. It is absolutely
still and quiet.

798
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:49,073
LIAM: I grab my earring. Let's do it. And I start
moving forward.

799
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:50,767
MARISHA: I follow him.

800
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:53,304
MATT: The rest of you guys continue with him?

801
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:56,907
WIL: I come up to the door and see what I can see
with my darkvision.

802
00:58:56,907 --> 00:59:05,570
MATT: Okay. Glancing inside as well, you can see
the prison goes on for as far as your visual range

803
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:12,359
is, about 60 feet. There are four sets of prison
cells on each side, so there are eight cells total,

804
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:17,358
and the hallway continues past that. But you can't
quite see beyond those initial four on each side.

805
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,271
You can glance on the inside. You can see what
looks like dried and brittle thatch that was once

806
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:29,526
used to cover the floor has slowly molded over
time. To your left, you see what looks to

807
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:37,501
be elements of a skeletal corpse that was left for
a very long period of time in the cell immediately

808
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:40,220
to your left as you look through the doorway.

809
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,778
WIL: I'll continue on.

810
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:52,632
MATT: Okay. As you enter this area and start
stepping in, the air itself has a very chemical

811
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:59,746
smell to it. It's hard to describe. There's
something musty and untouched to the air, but

812
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:08,627
there's also some sort of gentle hint of an acrid
scent. Do you guys continue forward through this

813
01:00:08,627 --> 01:00:09,976
prison area?

814
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:14,148
LIAM: I'm looking at the floor and everything as
far out as I can see ahead of me.

815
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:15,421
MATT: Okay.

816
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:17,571
MARISHA: What's above us?

817
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:25,629
MATT: Looking up, it's about 15 feet up, and it is
another smooth stone ceiling. The construction

818
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:42,423
here looks old. You, specifically, go ahead and
make a perception check. With advantage, because

819
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:44,358
you are a dwarf.

820
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:47,971
WIL: 12 plus whatever. Do I roll again?

821
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:52,126
MATT: Yeah, roll again. As you're a dwarf, and
this is an underground stone structure.

822
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:54,687
WIL: Oh, nine. So 15.

823
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:59,423
MATT: Okay, that's not bad. Looking at the
stonework here, it's definitely created for

824
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:08,279
function more than any sort of presentory
functionality. You gather from looking at the

825
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:17,089
nearby pieces of the stone wall that connects with
the first set of metal bars that this was probably

826
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:23,956
carved a few hundred years ago, and the metal bars
as you move past-- you guys see this too-- the

827
01:01:23,956 --> 01:01:29,651
doorways that lead into these, some appear to be
locked and some are completely open, easy to

828
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:36,909
swing, and as you pull it open, (creak) very heavy
rust against those iron doors, probably affected

829
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:42,400
largely by the nearby moisture emanating from the
room and whatever chemical's hanging in the air.

830
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,038
WILL: Are we still lit?

831
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,211
MATT: You're still lit by his Light spell, yes.

832
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:56,137
MARISHA: And there's nothing really in the prison
cells, with the exception of one skeleton?

833
01:01:56,137 --> 01:01:58,756
MATT: Well, that was in one room. If you want to
go ahead and check around, go ahead and make an

834
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,904
investigation check.

835
01:01:59,904 --> 01:02:01,669
LIAM: I thought we would have seen it here.

836
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:04,494
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll look around in the cells.
Natural 20!

837
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:11,545
MATT: There is balance to the universe. As you're
walking past, Keyleth, looking over on one side,

838
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:18,446
you see further up, with a bunch of the thatch
pushed around it, there appears to be a corpse

839
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:25,438
that doesn't have the layer of dust that a number
of the other skeletal piles in some of the other

840
01:02:25,438 --> 01:02:31,871
cells seem to have. The door to get into the cell,
though, does appear to be locked.

841
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:36,757
MARISHA: Vax. Need your help; this is locked.

842
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,249
LIAM: What's in there?

843
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:41,237
MARISHA: Looks like a fresh dead guy?

844
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:45,589
LIAM: Okay. Out comes the pick. I'm going to
perception check that corpse through the cell.

845
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:49,280
That's a 12.

846
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,824
MATT: It's hard to tell. It's mostly covered with
a lot of this thatch. It doesn't look like it was

847
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:57,796
intentionally covered, but some sort of a struggle
took place in this room.

848
01:02:57,796 --> 01:03:00,736
LIAM: Now for the door. Natural 20.

849
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,945
WIL: You're welcome.

850
01:03:03,945 --> 01:03:07,680
(laughter)

851
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,625
WIL: I work in mysterious ways.

852
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:17,639
MATT: The lock on this, it's not an intricate
lock, but it is very heavily rusted, and as soon

853
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,889
as you start moving in there, you realize that
there is actually something metal that has been

854
01:03:20,889 --> 01:03:27,416
broken off inside, whether by a previous key, just
through accident, or intent, it was broken off

855
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:32,672
inside. You manage to find a way to remove it,
pull the piece out, and still get the lock open.

856
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:39,545
The gate swings open, and you guys enter to
inspect this corpse. Looking at it, you notice

857
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:46,473
that the body has been probably dead for a couple
months. It is in prolonged state of decomposition,

858
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:52,949
but there is still some semblance of flesh
sloughing off the remnants of the bone. You can

859
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:57,468
see from the wounds that it has received that a
large portion of it has been torn open very

860
01:03:57,468 --> 01:04:02,906
violently and elements of it have been removed.
The softer organs.

861
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,785
WIL: Is it wearing any clothing?

862
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:12,136
MATT: As you inspect it, you look and see that
while smashed with blood and dirt and dust, the

863
01:04:12,136 --> 01:04:17,142
outfit does appear to be that of a Duskmeadow
Bastion.

864
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:22,948
LIAM: I feel really terrible, but I'm going to
give him the old half-elven pat-down and see if I

865
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:25,485
can find anything on his personage.

866
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:29,349
MATT: Looking about his entire body, anything of
value has been taken.

867
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:31,025
WILL: Can I speak with him?

868
01:04:31,025 --> 01:04:32,332
MATT: Can you what?

869
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:34,381
WILL: I'd like to cast Speak With Dead.

870
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:36,404
MATT: You can.

871
01:04:36,404 --> 01:04:39,142
WILL: Let's find out what killed him.

872
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:40,262
LIAM: You can do that?

873
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:42,024
WILL: Yes, I can do many things.

874
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:43,538
LIAM: That's badass!

875
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:45,821
MARISHA: And he's a dusk-what Bastion?

876
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:51,310
MATT: Duskmeadow, which is the section of
Vasselheim that worships the Raven Queen. The guys

877
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:57,171
that you encountered earlier in the road? The
dark, studded leather armor with the cloak swept

878
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:58,337
over one arm.

879
01:04:58,337 --> 01:04:59,774
LIAM: You know he's dead, right?

880
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:04,046
WIL: I cast Annoyed Dwarf to know that he was
likely killed by the rakshasa. Why are we standing

881
01:05:04,046 --> 01:05:05,309
in this room?

882
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:06,975
WILL: I want to know when he was killed.

883
01:05:06,975 --> 01:05:09,813
WIL: I'm not stopping you.

884
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:17,369
MATT: Okay, so as you sit down and you begin
preparing your ritual, you once again mutter under

885
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:24,018
your breath and begrudgingly pull out your symbol.
As you continue casting the spell, there's a

886
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:32,405
slight shimmer of greenish-blue light that slowly
pours over the corpse, seeps into the bones, and

887
01:05:32,405 --> 01:05:40,253
for a moment you see Kashaw go into this
trance-like state. Kashaw, you see from within the

888
01:05:40,253 --> 01:05:46,749
corpse, the face sits up with this horrible
cracking bone-like sound. The skeletal element

889
01:05:46,749 --> 01:05:52,950
with this partially mummified and mostly rotten
face steps forward, and the vacuous sockets that

890
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:58,570
once held its eyes turn towards you, and you could
swear you see the bone of its grimace grin as it

891
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:04,624
airily whispers towards you, "Why do you bother
me?"

892
01:06:04,624 --> 01:06:06,930
WILL: Because I have questions.

893
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,180
MATT: "What questions do you have?"

894
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,869
WILL: What killed you?

895
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:23,609
MATT: "Something that was not supposed to be here.
Something vicious, something untrue. It wasn't

896
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:31,568
"what it seemed. This woman was asking for help,
and no one's supposed to be down here if it's not

897
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:42,947
"their route. Occasionally, we come and check on
these abandoned parts of the prison. A woman was

898
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:55,096
"here. A woman should not be down here. I went to
ask what was wrong, and she took this from me."

899
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:59,206
And the bony hand reaches up and gestures to the
throat, and you can see there's giant claw marks

900
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:06,031
across the front of its spinal cord where its neck
is that give the sensation that something tore its

901
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:07,570
throat out.

902
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,137
WILL: A woman did this to you?

903
01:07:09,137 --> 01:07:11,055
MATT: "Aye."

904
01:07:11,055 --> 01:07:13,571
MARISHA: Shapeshifter.

905
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:18,778
WILL: Or there's more than one. When? When were
you killed?

906
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:27,544
MATT: "14 weeks have passed. I was resting."

907
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:38,561
WILL: Anybody have questions? He's not going to be
here long, I can tell you that. Not at 14 weeks.

908
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:46,220
MARISHA: Ask him if he knows which direction he
went, and if he has a hideout.

909
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,892
WILL: Which direction she went, you mean.

910
01:07:48,892 --> 01:07:51,351
MARISHA: Well, he or she or whatever it was.

911
01:07:51,351 --> 01:07:55,154
WILL: Did you see which direction she went after
she killed you?

912
01:07:55,154 --> 01:08:06,669
MATT: "She walked away, laughing and eating parts
of me. I have not seen her since, but others walk

913
01:08:06,669 --> 01:08:17,552
"these halls. I've seen a dwarf pass through two or
three times, and as it did and passed my cell, it

914
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:26,887
"laughed. Sometimes guards come to inspect, but
none have found me. None have found me yet."

915
01:08:26,887 --> 01:08:33,468
WILL: Are all the guards that come Bastions of the
Raven Queen?

916
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:42,622
MATT: "We are the ones to protect the Amaranthine
Oubliette. That is our job here. You sit in the

917
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:49,286
"lower forgotten halls of the Oubliette. My final
resting place."

918
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:52,270
WILL: Stormcloud? Any questions?

919
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,293
ORION: I think we've learned all we can from this
one.

920
01:08:55,293 --> 01:08:57,763
MARISHA: Which direction was the dwarf walking?

921
01:08:57,763 --> 01:09:02,782
WILL: You can answer her. What direction was the
dwarf going?

922
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:10,000
MATT: The other hand creeps up from underneath the
thatch. As you guys are watching this, the corpse

923
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,632
is doing nothing, it's just lying there, he is
talking to an unmoving corpse. For your vision,

924
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:18,172
the hand reaches over and points in the direction
you guys came from.

925
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:22,808
WILL: So it went the way we came.

926
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:26,256
MATT: "That was two weeks ago."

927
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:34,024
MARISHA: But he said he's been coming and going,
so maybe he was just leaving?

928
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:40,371
WILL: Coming the same direction we came from,
though. That seems odd. And a man,

929
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:42,732
a dwarf, and a woman.

930
01:09:42,732 --> 01:09:45,428
LIAM: Weeks ago. Not five minutes ago.

931
01:09:45,428 --> 01:09:54,180
MATT: The spell fades, and the corpse falls back
to its original pose, jaw left open, aghast in its

932
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,564
final moments.

933
01:09:55,564 --> 01:09:58,874
LIAM: Thorbir's right. We're burning time. We need
to go in.

934
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:01,570
WILL: Go in where? Do we go back the direction the
dwarf came?

935
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:09,421
ORION: I rolled a 23 arcana check on Thorbir's
jeweled knife that he gave me.

936
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:28,358
MATT: Just so you guys are aware, you are
essentially in this vicinity of the prison. This

937
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:33,682
was the room where you found the corpse, here. And
you've seen just enough light begin to reveal

938
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:36,082
there is a secondary prison room up here.

939
01:10:36,082 --> 01:10:38,597
WILL: I'm sorry, but we came from that direction?

940
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:42,693
MATT: From this door, yes. This would've connected
right there.

941
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:44,216
WILL: Okay.

942
01:10:44,216 --> 01:10:48,764
WIL: Every second we're here, it's getting away.

943
01:10:48,764 --> 01:10:50,900
ORION: I agree.

944
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:58,189
LIAM: You're absolutely right. We're going in.
When we're in there, you keep it busy, and I will

945
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:59,627
carve it up.

946
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:02,729
WIL: I will keep it busy.

947
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:06,855
WILL: Try not to get your dick bit by a rat.

948
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:12,957
LIAM: I slide past Tiberius, crouch down to the
ground again, and start scuttling along the

949
01:11:12,957 --> 01:11:17,218
ground. Looking, listening.

950
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:20,901
ORION: What was the ruling on the arcana check?

951
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,109
MATT: For?

952
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:24,692
ORION: The jeweled knife that Thorbir gave me.

953
01:11:24,692 --> 01:11:30,330
MATT: The knife does not appear to have any sort
of magical aura about it. It's just a very

954
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:38,883
well-crafted and probably relatively expensive
piece of functionality or ornamental use. It's a

955
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:42,958
very fine blade, though. It would be a fine thing
to enchant, if you were inclined to.

956
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:45,898
ORION: Kashaw. How close are you to your god?

957
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:53,357
WILL: At one time, very close. Now? I don't think
you'd want to be anywhere near her.

958
01:11:53,357 --> 01:11:55,828
MARISHA: And which god is that?

959
01:11:55,828 --> 01:12:07,354
WILL: My god is called Vesh, and I am the only one
on the planet who has ever heard of her. Yeah, she

960
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:11,790
killed everybody else. Want to talk to her?

961
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,623
ORION: I don't.

962
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:16,533
WILL: No. Neither do I.

963
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,951
MARISHA: Why did she spare you?

964
01:12:18,951 --> 01:12:24,195
WILL: Because I'm her husband.

965
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:29,705
ORION: Oh. How is that, being married to a god?
That's rather inconvenient.

966
01:12:29,705 --> 01:12:33,693
MARISHA: And how does that happen in the first
place?

967
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:40,037
WIL: Thorbir sighs heavily and steps into the
room, and follows Vax.

968
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:43,372
MARISHA: We can walk and talk. You guys go.

969
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:46,832
MATT: So you're walking forward.

970
01:12:46,832 --> 01:12:53,767
WILL: She married me at birth. My mother was told
that I was a special child, which is why I had the

971
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:59,586
yellow eyes. I had two when I was born. We were
married at birth. She killed everyone in the

972
01:12:59,586 --> 01:13:05,792
village. On my 15th naming-day she came to
consummate the marriage. I made the first 50

973
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:11,466
slashes on my right arm. She made the next 50 for
a ritual called the Sting of the Hundred, and when

974
01:13:11,466 --> 01:13:15,968
my blood mixed with her sweat, I gained all her
memories. That's when I found out she was

975
01:13:15,968 --> 01:13:22,142
essentially the devil. I was raised as a healer
because I wasn't just supposed to be her husband,

976
01:13:22,142 --> 01:13:26,122
but also her balance, because the
universe wouldn't accept somebody as black as her

977
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:30,502
in it. Tried to kill her at 15. Haven't seen her
since.

978
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:37,576
ORION: Ooh. So it's not like you can ask for a
favor, I suppose.

979
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:43,045
WILL: I suppose I could, but there's a good chance
she'll kill you, me, and everyone around at the

980
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:44,034
same time.

981
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:46,846
MATT: At this point in time, as you guys are
having this conversation, you moved up and looked

982
01:13:46,846 --> 01:13:52,649
and you can see there are two humanoids walking
from this direction further down this hallway,

983
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:57,218
which you can see leads this direction.

984
01:13:57,218 --> 01:14:00,841
LIAM: I'd like to imagine that Thorbir and Vax
left that conversation behind a little.

985
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:09,124
MATT: As you see them approaching here, stepping
in your direction, they are both dressed in full

986
01:14:09,124 --> 01:14:18,042
Duskmeadow Bastion armor. The one on the far end
appears to be older, balding with thinning gray

987
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:24,229
hair. The one who's further up is in his forties.
Big thick brown beard, hair pulled back into a

988
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:29,574
ponytail, and they're both lightly conversing to
each other. Not paying much attention, like

989
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:32,277
they're running through a routine.

990
01:14:32,277 --> 01:14:37,615
LIAM: I start pushing back on Thorbir, backing
everybody up, silently pushing backward and trying

991
01:14:37,615 --> 01:14:43,193
to steer everyone in a heap backwards and to the
side of the cell we just came from.

992
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:46,978
Just trust me.

993
01:14:46,978 --> 01:14:48,859
MATT: Make a stealth check.

994
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:53,667
LIAM: 19.

995
01:14:53,667 --> 01:15:03,912
MATT: 19? Okay. As you're pushing everyone back,
(shushing) whispering all this, you hear a voice

996
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:20,128
say, "Hello? Hold on. Hello?" The one with the
beard approaches with his hand on his weapon, the

997
01:15:20,128 --> 01:15:21,798
other one moving along the back.

998
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:23,512
LIAM: Did I get them into the cell?

999
01:15:23,512 --> 01:15:25,454
MATT: You pushed them far back and into the cell?

1000
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,276
LIAM: Yeah, that was what I wanted to do, just
backwards to everybody.

1001
01:15:28,276 --> 01:15:30,017
ORION: Yeah, and as this is going on, I dissipate
the Light spell.

1002
01:15:30,017 --> 01:15:34,183
MATT: Okay. Light spell vanishes. He walks up and
turns the corner.

1003
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:42,461
LIAM: I give everybody a group hug with my Cloak
of Elvenkind and try to make a big rag pile out of

1004
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:47,884
this corner. I'm very uncomfortably pressed
against Thorbir's backside.

1005
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:53,946
MATT: Okay. The cloak can only really cover you
and partially another person. The rest of you all

1006
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:55,274
make a stealth check.

1007
01:15:55,274 --> 01:15:59,914
MARISHA: So who's it partially covering?

1008
01:15:59,914 --> 01:16:01,567
LIAM: (laughs) Thorbir.

1009
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:02,552
MARISHA: Thorbir.

1010
01:16:02,552 --> 01:16:07,168
MATT: No, it's not enough to really effectively do
it to another person. It's just more for flavor.

1011
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:08,454
LIAM: It's the thought that counts.

1012
01:16:08,454 --> 01:16:09,935
MARISHA: 15.

1013
01:16:09,935 --> 01:16:11,106
WILL: Five.

1014
01:16:11,106 --> 01:16:12,255
ORION: 20.

1015
01:16:12,255 --> 01:16:25,344
WIL: A viewer whose chat name begins with a U-- I
won't identify the viewer in case this goes

1016
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:34,197
badly-- sent me these dice and said, may they roll
well. I would like to apologize in advance for

1017
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:46,191
what is about to happen to this person's beloved
dice. It's a 15. Oh, look at that! It turns out

1018
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:48,664
that there are two-digit numbers on these dice.

1019
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,951
(laughter)

1020
01:16:50,951 --> 01:16:55,661
WIL: And my stealth is two, so that's 17.

1021
01:16:55,661 --> 01:17:03,030
MATT: 17, all right. So the guy walks into the
room, looks back and forth. The one behind him

1022
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:13,185
steps forward into the room a bit. The other one
steps behind him. Looks about. Looks from one side

1023
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:19,658
of the room, looks over to your room. There's
almost a glimmer of recognition in his eye, and

1024
01:17:19,658 --> 01:17:37,986
continues walking past. They just start walking
back the direction you guys came from.

1025
01:17:38,055 --> 01:17:40,056
MARISHA: Uh.

1026
01:17:40,187 --> 01:17:44,844
MATT: The other one--

1027
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:46,961
MARISHA: I throw up a Wall of Stone.

1028
01:17:47,048 --> 01:17:48,944
MATT: Where?

1029
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,341
MARISHA: Right there.

1030
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:52,439
MATT: Right there?

1031
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:53,729
MARISHA: To lock them in.

1032
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:56,906
WILL: That wasn't quiet.

1033
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,853
MATT: Wall of Stone goes up.

1034
01:17:59,853 --> 01:18:01,565
LIAM: (muffled) What the fuck?

1035
01:18:01,565 --> 01:18:05,423
WIL: How long does that last?

1036
01:18:05,423 --> 01:18:06,805
MARISHA: It's permanent!

1037
01:18:06,805 --> 01:18:07,859
WIL: Let's go.

1038
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:10,400
WILL: It's time to move.

1039
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:18,062
LIAM: All right, back around the corner, following
around, looking, listening. Everybody the same.

1040
01:18:18,062 --> 01:18:25,733
MATT: That chemical smell is getting stronger and
stronger. It's burning your nose a little bit.

1041
01:18:25,733 --> 01:18:35,007
MARISHA: So Kashaw. If you're the only one who
knows about this goddess, that means she also

1042
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,480
killed your parents?

1043
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,857
WILL: Yes. Thank you for bringing that up.

1044
01:18:40,857 --> 01:18:47,292
LIAM: Perception? I got you, baby. Well, that was
perception.

1045
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:53,712
WIL: So I'm attempting to make a perception roll
to see if I can pull anything out of these smells,

1046
01:18:53,712 --> 01:19:00,720
maybe based on my experience with smithing and the
chemicals that are associated with all that sort

1047
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:11,855
of thing, but I did roll a three. So I guess I
would add a three. The best I can get out of that

1048
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:13,423
is a nine.

1049
01:19:13,423 --> 01:19:22,006
MATT: Okay. You (sniffs) and it clears your
sinuses up pretty well. Much like a fresh dab of

1050
01:19:22,006 --> 01:19:28,809
wasabi, your nostrils are a little more open.
Because it's not sulfurous, it doesn't have

1051
01:19:28,809 --> 01:19:34,232
something similar to what you'd find in smithing
in your experience, at the very least. It's hard

1052
01:19:34,232 --> 01:19:36,963
to really place where it comes from. You said
you're going which way?

1053
01:19:36,963 --> 01:19:39,110
LIAM: Towards that other door that they did not
come out of.

1054
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,275
MATT: This here? All right.

1055
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,877
LIAM: 23 I rolled, perception.

1056
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:46,796
MATT: 23. You approach the door. This door is
locked. It does not appear to be trapped.

1057
01:19:46,796 --> 01:19:48,910
LIAM: Okay. Let's unlock it.

1058
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,077
MATT: Okay.

1059
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,735
LIAM: That is a 21.

1060
01:19:52,735 --> 01:20:00,133
MATT: Okay. As you reach down to the lock and you
place the picks inside, start fiddling, you look

1061
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:08,321
at the iron around it, and the actual metal seems
to be frosting over. You pull back your head, and

1062
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:12,968
as you exhale, your breath becomes visible and the
temperature seems to drop significantly, and as

1063
01:20:12,968 --> 01:20:19,117
soon as you look up at the wood, something
shimmers in the wood, and it's a humanoid face

1064
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:21,388
that just pushes out of the wood.

1065
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:24,141
LIAM: Can I use Uncanny Dodge to roll backward
right now?

1066
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:25,891
MATT: Right now?

1067
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,491
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1068
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:29,932
WIL: Do we see this happening?

1069
01:20:29,932 --> 01:20:36,559
MATT: You guys are hearing his reaction to this
just happen in the front, there. I'm going to go

1070
01:20:36,559 --> 01:20:39,580
ahead and say sure.

1071
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,464
ORION: Are there torches down this hallway?

1072
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:47,845
MATT: So one of the hands comes through, reaching
out for you, this ghostly arm

1073
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:49,391
just swings towards you.

1074
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,457
LIAM: And I say, nope!

1075
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:56,032
MATT: I'd like to have everybody roll initiative.

1076
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:59,890
MARISHA: Oh, again? Man, we're going to run into
everything.

1077
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:07,356
ORION: Are there torches in this hallway?

1078
01:21:07,356 --> 01:21:08,586
MATT: No.

1079
01:21:08,586 --> 01:21:10,756
WILL: Lighting, open flame of any kind?

1080
01:21:10,756 --> 01:21:12,041
MATT: Currently, no.

1081
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:13,661
WILL: Ten.

1082
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:14,708
WIL: 11.

1083
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,978
MATT: All right. So we have 20 or higher? Anyone?

1084
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:21,233
ORION: Yes. 21.

1085
01:21:21,233 --> 01:21:26,914
MATT: All right. 20 to 15? 15 to ten?

1086
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:28,168
WIL: 11.

1087
01:21:28,168 --> 01:21:29,789
WILL: I had ten, yeah.

1088
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:38,739
MATT: There we go. All right, nine to five?

1089
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:41,433
MARISHA: Nine.

1090
01:21:41,433 --> 01:21:43,264
MATT: All right, and then?

1091
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:47,239
LIAM: 11, as well. I roll back, going (squeals).

1092
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:53,925
MATT: All right. Tiberius, you're up first. As you
see these two drifting humanoid translucent

1093
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:59,481
ghostly entities drift out the door that Vax was
at as he leaps backward, a second one drifts out

1094
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:03,409
of the stone down the hallway and turns towards
the group, both of them giving these horrible low

1095
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:09,447
moaning sounds. (moans) Their feet are dragging
about a foot off the ground.

1096
01:22:09,447 --> 01:22:13,612
ORION: I'll point to the one coming from opposite
of Vax.

1097
01:22:13,612 --> 01:22:14,649
MATT: There?

1098
01:22:14,649 --> 01:22:18,823
ORION: That guy.

1099
01:22:18,823 --> 01:22:20,141
MATT: That guy, all right.

1100
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:24,082
ORION: And then I'm going to do True Strike on
him. And I'll back away!

1101
01:22:24,082 --> 01:22:26,221
MATT: Back away.

1102
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:30,473
ORION: That's good. That's my turn.

1103
01:22:30,473 --> 01:22:44,698
MATT: Cool. All right. They go next. This one is
going to drift forward. Now, the one that swiped

1104
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:50,184
at you, as you dodge backward, it drifts forward
and its arms reach out for you and attempt to

1105
01:22:50,184 --> 01:22:54,197
pierce the front of your chest. Go ahead and make
a charisma saving throw.

1106
01:22:54,197 --> 01:22:56,311
LIAM: Okay. I will do that.

1107
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:59,474
MATT: Keyleth, you do the same as the spirit
suddenly--

1108
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,205
MARISHA: A charisma saving throw?

1109
01:23:01,205 --> 01:23:03,552
MATT: Yes. Flickers and appears right before you.

1110
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,466
LIAM: 11.

1111
01:23:04,466 --> 01:23:05,579
MATT: 11.

1112
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:08,035
MARISHA: Okay. 11.

1113
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:10,001
MATT: Okay.

1114
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:21,822
LIAM, MARISHA, and WILL: (cartoonish ghost 
noises)

1115
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:28,657
MATT: You guys watch as both of these ghostly
entities (whoosh) completely slip into the

1116
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:35,041
physical form of Vax and Keyleth, who each shudder
for a second as their eyes glaze over. Both the

1117
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:41,958
entities are no longer visible. However, you feel
the presence of a cold, invading mind full of

1118
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:49,106
anger and distant loss and rage fill your brain,
and your body is not your own.

1119
01:23:49,106 --> 01:23:51,029
MARISHA: Sorry, guys.

1120
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:53,292
LIAM: This is going to be fun.

1121
01:23:53,292 --> 01:24:00,723
MATT: Suddenly you see Vax pull his daggers out and
turn around and look at the rest of the group.

1122
01:24:00,723 --> 01:24:05,698
Keyleth turns around and snarls at the rest of the
group, this twisted grin.

1123
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:08,959
LIAM: (whispering) They call me Count Chocula.

1124
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:13,319
(laughter)

1125
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,371
MATT: Thorbir, you're up.

1126
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:32,612
WIL: I am going to make a goading attack to try
and draw whoever's closer.

1127
01:24:32,612 --> 01:24:35,383
MATT: Closest to you would be Keyleth. Keyleth is
right next to you.

1128
01:24:35,383 --> 01:24:37,335
MARISHA: I don't even know what to do.

1129
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:49,006
WIL: Yeah, so I'm just going to make a goading
attack, and if I hit, then they come after me. Or

1130
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:58,480
she comes after me. I'm pretty sure I don't hit. I
don't know why I'm rolling. Sorry, that's a four

1131
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,864
on my first roll.

1132
01:24:59,864 --> 01:25:02,316
LIAM: Use this one; it's quicker.

1133
01:25:02,316 --> 01:25:09,338
WIL: (laughs) Oh, 14. I'm sorry. I can't remember.
Oh, plus ten. 24.

1134
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,766
MATT: 24 versus Keyleth? What's your armor class?

1135
01:25:11,766 --> 01:25:13,107
MARISHA: 17.

1136
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:14,665
MATT: 17. That hits Keyleth.

1137
01:25:14,665 --> 01:25:16,535
WIL: Sorry about this.

1138
01:25:16,535 --> 01:25:20,555
MARISHA: It's okay. Just keep me alive, Cashew.

1139
01:25:20,555 --> 01:25:27,686
WIL: Can I pull the attack to not do as much
damage? I mean, other than the way I usually roll

1140
01:25:27,686 --> 01:25:32,584
dice. Can I hit her with like the blunt side of
the axe--

1141
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:35,078
MATT: You can say subdual damage. It'll still
damage her.

1142
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:38,194
WIL: Okay. Should I roll my regular attack dice?

1143
01:25:38,194 --> 01:25:40,496
MATT: Yeah, your regular attack dice.

1144
01:25:40,496 --> 01:25:43,690
WIL: 15 points of damage.

1145
01:25:43,741 --> 01:25:49,761
MATT: 15 points of damage to you, Keyleth, as you
get smacked broadside with the blunt edge of

1146
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:54,669
Thorbir's axe. You see this happening, and in your
head you're screaming, trying to push this out,

1147
01:25:54,669 --> 01:26:00,554
but no matter how hard your will imposes itself,
your body is not your own. You feel like you're

1148
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:03,324
restrained in a dark closet, watching from a
distant hallway as

1149
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,953
somebody else controls your body.

1150
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:11,414
WIL: So I have to expend a superiority die, and I
add this-- yeah. Oh, fuck you! Now you're going to

1151
01:26:11,414 --> 01:26:14,326
work? So that's nine more points. Sorry.

1152
01:26:14,326 --> 01:26:16,114
MATT: Nine more points of damage on top of that.

1153
01:26:16,114 --> 01:26:18,793
WIL: And then the target needs to make a wisdom
saving throw.

1154
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:25,564
MATT: All right. I will make that the ghost
creature. That is a 16.

1155
01:26:25,564 --> 01:26:27,682
WIL: Yeah.

1156
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,525
MATT: What's the DC on it?

1157
01:26:29,525 --> 01:26:31,531
WIL: I don't know. It doesn't say.

1158
01:26:31,531 --> 01:26:33,527
MATT: Is this for your battlemaster, for goading
attack?

1159
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:34,736
WIL: Yeah.

1160
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:37,076
MATT: Goading attack with battlemaster.

1161
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:38,799
WIL: Sorry, nerds. I don't play this version.

1162
01:26:38,799 --> 01:26:41,125
LIAM: Would it be his wisdom?

1163
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:48,922
WIL: My wisdom saving throw is two. My wisdom is
plus two.

1164
01:26:48,922 --> 01:26:53,428
MATT: Okay. Oh, the DC is eight plus your
proficiency bonus, which would be 12, plus your--

1165
01:26:53,428 --> 01:26:55,078
what's your strength modifier?

1166
01:26:55,078 --> 01:26:56,259
WIL: Four.

1167
01:26:56,259 --> 01:27:05,560
MATT: Four, so that'd be 16. 16. So yeah, it just
makes the saving throw.

1168
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:10,386
WIL: Oh. Well. Glad I wounded my friend for no
good reason. Okay.

1169
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:12,063
MARISHA: It makes its saving throw?

1170
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:14,986
WIL: So it makes its saving throw, so nothing
happens.

1171
01:27:14,986 --> 01:27:16,817
MATT: Right, so that was your first two strikes.

1172
01:27:16,817 --> 01:27:19,885
MARISHA: So he just punched me for no reason?

1173
01:27:19,885 --> 01:27:25,201
WIL: Yeah, I'm not going to make my third attack.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

1174
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:29,298
MATT: Vax, you don't get a turn. You are unable to
control your body, and you also do not get a

1175
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:33,343
saving throw. You are considered possessed. Kash,
you're up.

1176
01:27:33,343 --> 01:27:40,044
WILL: I don't know if this is possible. Can I use
Banishment and target one of the ghosts that's

1177
01:27:40,044 --> 01:27:41,412
actually possessing them?

1178
01:27:41,412 --> 01:27:46,285
MATT: You have no way of knowing how to target the
creature. There is no visual or physical form. You

1179
01:27:46,285 --> 01:27:51,495
just see your friend with a glazed-over look in
the eyes, and that cold sensation around them. You

1180
01:27:51,495 --> 01:27:56,395
have some experience with undead, and you know you
have some tools against them, but Banishment is

1181
01:27:56,395 --> 01:28:00,558
something that you have no way of targeting the
spirit within them. You would have to target them

1182
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:01,735
physically.

1183
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:09,383
WILL: I think what you said was right; we might
have to knock them out. So maybe we target one at

1184
01:28:09,383 --> 01:28:12,998
a time? I hold Vax, and you come in.

1185
01:28:12,998 --> 01:28:14,640
MARISHA: I have 13 hit points.

1186
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,719
ORION: Yeah, you should definitely--

1187
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:21,330
WILL: Should do that. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to cast
Hold Person, and I'm going to hold Vax as tight as

1188
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:22,428
I can.

1189
01:28:22,428 --> 01:28:28,657
MATT: All right. What's the spell DC for you?

1190
01:28:28,657 --> 01:28:31,526
WILL: It is 16.

1191
01:28:31,577 --> 01:28:34,193
MATT: And is that wisdom saving throw on that?

1192
01:28:34,193 --> 01:28:36,629
WILL: Is that right?

1193
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:42,905
MATT: Let's see, Hold Person. Wisdom, all right.
Go ahead and make a will saving throw, Vax. Or

1194
01:28:42,905 --> 01:28:44,126
wisdom saving throw.

1195
01:28:44,126 --> 01:28:47,219
MARISHA: Fail it. Something I'll never say to
you.

1196
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:48,459
LIAM: 17.

1197
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:49,657
MATT: 17.

1198
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:54,523
MARISHA: What's his DC? What's your DC? Or is it
versus his wisdom?

1199
01:28:54,523 --> 01:28:55,579
WILL: 16.

1200
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:58,740
MATT: 16. Defeats it. The spell effect shimmers
off.

1201
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:02,854
LIAM: Right now, me and ghost in my mind are doing
that scene from Ghost with the pottery.

1202
01:29:02,854 --> 01:29:07,116
WILL: And my spell just can't get to you. Damn
it.

1203
01:29:07,116 --> 01:29:12,381
MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn. Do
you want to move anywhere, or are you going to

1204
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,996
stay where you are?

1205
01:29:13,996 --> 01:29:17,456
WILL: Yeah, I think I'm going to have to tuck tail
and run. Let's try to split them up, at least, if

1206
01:29:17,456 --> 01:29:18,521
we can.

1207
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:20,625
MATT: Okay. Which way do you want to go?

1208
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:24,342
WILL: Really? You want to get them together? Then
let's do that. All right, fair enough. Let's get

1209
01:29:24,342 --> 01:29:25,713
them together.

1210
01:29:25,713 --> 01:29:27,967
ORION: Over here, Kashaw!

1211
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:32,080
WILL: Yeah. Let's move. I want to go with
Stormdragon.

1212
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,946
MATT: As you move back, Keyleth, you get an attack
of opportunity on him. Go ahead and roll an attack

1213
01:29:35,946 --> 01:29:37,513
with your staff.

1214
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:46,991
MARISHA: Sorry, Cashew. Ooh, critical fail. I
don't want to!

1215
01:29:46,991 --> 01:29:49,093
WILL: I think she might like me!

1216
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:54,964
MATT: As there is the mental struggle going on in
Keyleth's mind, this swing has extreme intensity

1217
01:29:54,964 --> 01:29:59,610
and then halfway through, just streaks off and slams
into the stone wall. Part of the staff splinters

1218
01:29:59,776 --> 01:30:02,782
and breaks at the edge. It's still functional, but
definitely took a hit from the wall.

1219
01:30:02,782 --> 01:30:04,267
MARISHA: My favorite staff!

1220
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:10,838
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you
lose your turn. Up at the top of the round,

1221
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:11,874
Tiberius.

1222
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:16,364
MARISHA: Can we not try and save from it? We can't
do shit? We're just on auto-pilot, at this point?

1223
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:22,521
MATT: Does anyone here at the top of this round
want to make a religion check? Does anyone here

1224
01:30:22,521 --> 01:30:24,166
want to make a religion check?

1225
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:25,250
WILL: Might as well, right?

1226
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:28,935
MATT: Yeah, you've had some experience with death
and undeath in your history.

1227
01:30:28,935 --> 01:30:29,934
ORION: 20?

1228
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:32,751
MATT: 20. Not you.

1229
01:30:32,751 --> 01:30:40,239
WILL: So plus seven. It's a six. No, it was nine.
16.

1230
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:47,871
MATT: 16. Okay. You've heard of certain creatures,
ghosts, that can possess certain entities. When a

1231
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:53,379
creature is possessed, you know from your
experience that it is very difficult to remove the

1232
01:30:53,379 --> 01:31:00,486
possession unless it's through some sort of a
ritual that forces undead away, or if the actual

1233
01:31:00,486 --> 01:31:09,392
person is brought to unconsciousness and near
death themself. Tiberius, you have the same visual

1234
01:31:09,392 --> 01:31:14,477
on this, though a little part of your brain says,
wait. You've seen Pike do something that scared

1235
01:31:14,477 --> 01:31:18,108
undead before. Top of the round, brings us to
Tiberius.

1236
01:31:18,108 --> 01:31:23,532
ORION: I take no pleasure in this. I cast Obelisk
of Stone and crush them.

1237
01:31:23,532 --> 01:31:25,862
MARISHA: Crush who?

1238
01:31:25,862 --> 01:31:27,064
ORION: Both of them.

1239
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:30,544
MATT: You don't have visual on Vax, currently.
There's a wall.

1240
01:31:30,544 --> 01:31:32,284
ORION: I'll move forward and then do it.

1241
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:35,288
MATT: Okay. You move up to there and do it?

1242
01:31:35,288 --> 01:31:39,084
ORION: Or as close as I can, as far away as I can
see Vax.

1243
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:45,933
MATT: Cool. So currently, these two stone pillars
slam and crush both of you towards the ceiling.

1244
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:47,638
LIAM: No, Tiberius-- !

1245
01:31:47,638 --> 01:31:51,686
MATT: Well, it's a dexterity saving throw, right?
So both of you make a dexterity saving throw.

1246
01:31:51,742 --> 01:31:56,272
LIAM: I rolled 22.

1247
01:31:56,272 --> 01:31:58,276
MARISHA: It's not going to be good. Yeah, I rolled
an 18.

1248
01:31:58,276 --> 01:32:00,294
MATT: So take half damage.

1249
01:32:00,294 --> 01:32:04,894
ORION: No, they take the damage. They're not
pinned. They just take the damage.

1250
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,632
MATT: So they both take the damage.

1251
01:32:06,632 --> 01:32:08,568
MARISHA: Probably unconscious.

1252
01:32:08,568 --> 01:32:17,513
ORION: 31 points of damage.

1253
01:32:17,513 --> 01:32:20,470
MARISHA: I'm unconscious.

1254
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:27,718
MATT: Keyleth, you fall unconscious on the ground,
forcing the spiritual entity out of your body.

1255
01:32:27,718 --> 01:32:37,597
ORION: I'm going to spend two sorcery points to
quicken a spell and then cast Scorching Ray right

1256
01:32:37,597 --> 01:32:38,773
at it. (fire blasts)

1257
01:32:38,773 --> 01:32:47,589
MATT: Okay. Go for it. So go ahead and roll for
the attack on each of them. Since it was forced

1258
01:32:47,589 --> 01:32:51,559
out, it is not in melee with you because it is far
enough away, so you straight roll for these.

1259
01:32:51,559 --> 01:33:08,765
ORION: What is that? Oh, plus my spell attack.
Okay, so 16 was one, 19, and 19.

1260
01:33:08,765 --> 01:33:12,627
MATT: All hit. Go ahead and roll damage for each.
Just give me a total damage.

1261
01:33:12,627 --> 01:33:15,894
ORION: Two, four, six.

1262
01:33:15,894 --> 01:33:18,573
LIAM: Rock that math, come on.

1263
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:26,462
ORION: Okay, that's ten and 15, and then 18, 23.

1264
01:33:26,462 --> 01:33:36,676
MATT: 23? Okay. You release all three Scorching
Rays blasting into the ghost. It's impacting, but

1265
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:42,770
the bursts seem to detonate through it. You can
see it's taking the hits, but it seems almost like

1266
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:49,506
because of its ethereal form, it's not feeling the
full brunt of the attacks. It's affected by it,

1267
01:33:49,506 --> 01:33:52,814
and you can see its form being shuddered around by
it, but it's not as effective as you're used to

1268
01:33:52,814 --> 01:34:01,230
them being. That ends your turn, Tiberius. This
creature here. Okay, it does not regain its

1269
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:10,524
possession ability. It is going to use Horrifying
Visage. All of a sudden, the ghost (roars)

1270
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:17,567
Ghostbusters style. It grows and it's just a
horrible screaming entity. I need all of you

1271
01:34:17,567 --> 01:34:21,762
except for Vax to go ahead and make a wisdom
saving throw.

1272
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:28,907
ORION: That's negative. That's 16.

1273
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:30,186
MATT: 16?

1274
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:31,435
WIL: 13.

1275
01:34:31,435 --> 01:34:32,537
WILL: 12.

1276
01:34:32,537 --> 01:34:40,912
MATT: 12. All of you guys manage to shrug off the
effect. You, however. There's something about the

1277
01:34:40,912 --> 01:34:47,787
way it screamed that for a moment, you swear it
had a face similar to Vesh from your wedding

1278
01:34:47,787 --> 01:34:53,227
night. It clutches your heart, and you are
considered frightened for the next minute. That

1279
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:59,366
means you cannot move closer to it, and your
attacks against it are at a disadvantage until you

1280
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:10,814
shrug it off. All right, then the possessed Vax is
going to, as his bonus action, attempt to make a

1281
01:35:10,814 --> 01:35:19,283
stealth check and back out of the way. Goes
against the wall. If I could have Thorbir and

1282
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:21,235
Tiberius make perception checks.

1283
01:35:21,235 --> 01:35:22,927
LIAM: Don't I make a stealth check?

1284
01:35:22,927 --> 01:35:24,353
MATT: I'm making it for you.

1285
01:35:24,353 --> 01:35:25,922
WIL: Oh, look at that!

1286
01:35:25,922 --> 01:35:27,105
LIAM: He got 19!

1287
01:35:27,105 --> 01:35:28,654
MARISHA: Oh my god!

1288
01:35:28,654 --> 01:35:31,372
WIL: All right. 24.

1289
01:35:31,372 --> 01:35:32,925
MATT: 24. Nice.

1290
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:35,288
ORION: I failed.

1291
01:35:35,288 --> 01:35:42,201
MATT: You failed? Okay. You see, out of the corner
of your eye, a couple of footsteps as Vax comes

1292
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:48,757
rushing up. You do not see it, though, and as Vax
turns the corner right here, brings out the

1293
01:35:48,757 --> 01:35:53,012
daggers and goes towards Tiberius, out of the
corner of your eye, you see a flash of light.

1294
01:35:53,012 --> 01:35:57,938
Actually, no. You make the attack roll on this.
Attack roll against Tiberius.

1295
01:35:57,938 --> 01:35:59,654
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

1296
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:03,674
MATT: Okay.

1297
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:10,635
ORION: Wait, he has to roll at disadvantage.
Cloak.

1298
01:36:10,635 --> 01:36:13,845
MATT: Right, but he has advantage on you because
you didn't see him, so it cancels it out.

1299
01:36:13,845 --> 01:36:17,738
LIAM: That's true, yeah. My cloak gives you
disadvantage.

1300
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:25,355
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll with sneak
attack damage against Tiberius.

1301
01:36:25,355 --> 01:36:38,908
LIAM: Okay. That is a nine plus five, ten, 22, 24.
That's 33.

1302
01:36:38,908 --> 01:36:42,118
MATT: 33 points of piercing damage against you.

1303
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:43,672
ORION: What's half of that?

1304
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:47,966
MATT: No Stoneskin. You've already cast a
concentration spell. Right, but when you cast one,

1305
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:51,482
the other one lasts for two more rounds, and you
started with True Strike.

1306
01:36:51,482 --> 01:36:55,183
MARISHA: It's also been way over a minute.

1307
01:36:55,183 --> 01:37:02,304
ORION: It's an hour-long spell. I can still hold
another one and do a different one, and hold the

1308
01:37:02,304 --> 01:37:03,614
other spell.

1309
01:37:03,614 --> 01:37:09,435
MATT: How it works is whenever you cast a new
concentration spell, the other one lasts for two

1310
01:37:09,435 --> 01:37:14,346
rounds, and then vanishes. I think this should be
the last round that you have it, because it's been

1311
01:37:14,346 --> 01:37:17,994
two rounds since you moved back. So this would be
the last round that you have it. So you still have

1312
01:37:17,994 --> 01:37:21,587
it, but it fades after this round. So halve that.

1313
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:27,039
ORION: That's 16? 17 points?

1314
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:33,278
MATT: Actually, and Stoneskin only works against
non-magical. So no, you take full damage because

1315
01:37:33,278 --> 01:37:35,106
his daggers are magic.

1316
01:37:35,106 --> 01:37:36,582
ORION: Both daggers are magical?

1317
01:37:36,582 --> 01:37:37,995
MATT: All of his daggers are magical.

1318
01:37:37,995 --> 01:37:40,319
MARISHA: Yeah, we're only rolling with magical
weapons at this point, yo.

1319
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:41,620
MATT: So you take full damage.

1320
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:46,144
ORION: Okay, cool. That's actually great to know.
I'm actually happy about that.

1321
01:37:46,144 --> 01:37:53,893
MATT: And you do not have your bonus action
because you used that to hide. So that's the one

1322
01:37:53,893 --> 01:37:55,585
attack you got. That round's over.

1323
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:57,274
LIAM: There's no save or anything?

1324
01:37:57,274 --> 01:38:05,888
MATT: Not for this. Not until someone somehow
forces the undead entity out of your body or drops

1325
01:38:05,888 --> 01:38:07,096
you to zero hit points.

1326
01:38:07,096 --> 01:38:08,553
LIAM: Let's go to the bar.

1327
01:38:08,553 --> 01:38:12,307
MATT: All right. That brings us to Thorbir.

1328
01:38:12,307 --> 01:38:22,141
WIL: (sighs) If I see this correctly, there's this
spectral creature in front of me and my possessed

1329
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:24,471
friend to my left. Is that right?

1330
01:38:24,471 --> 01:38:28,137
MATT: Correct. Actually, Keyleth, make a saving
throw.

1331
01:38:28,137 --> 01:38:34,107
MARISHA: I'm unconscious. Oh, right. Because I'm
unconscious. Seven.

1332
01:38:34,107 --> 01:38:38,785
MATT: Mark off a death saving throw. Thorbir?

1333
01:38:38,785 --> 01:38:54,308
WIL: Okay. Thorbir is going to-- I'm sorry. 16.

1334
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:56,578
MATT: Total of 16?

1335
01:38:56,578 --> 01:38:58,453
WIL: Yeah, total of 16.

1336
01:38:58,453 --> 01:38:59,956
LIAM: 17.

1337
01:38:59,956 --> 01:39:04,390
MATT: 17. Whiffs. He's too fast. He ducks
underneath the depth of the axe swing.

1338
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:08,970
WIL: Okay. Second attack. 18?

1339
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:11,583
MATT: 18 will hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
that.

1340
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,437
WIL: And I want to do that same thing.

1341
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:16,011
MATT: Goading attack? Okay.

1342
01:39:16,011 --> 01:39:26,412
WIL: Sorry, no. Those are 20-siders. I'm like, how
did I roll a 19 on a d12? 15 plus six. 21.

1343
01:39:26,412 --> 01:39:31,725
MATT: Are you rolling 2d12 for damage on that?

1344
01:39:31,725 --> 01:39:35,917
WIL: Yeah. My damage is 2d12 plus six slashing
damage.

1345
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:41,164
MATT: For a great axe, I think it should be 1d12.
I'm pretty sure.

1346
01:39:41,164 --> 01:39:44,028
WIL: I'm happy to make it 1d12.

1347
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:48,797
MATT: (laughs) Just as a note, yeah. The great axe
is 1d12 damage.

1348
01:39:48,797 --> 01:39:51,658
WIL: Oh. Well, I don't know why it says 2d12,
then.

1349
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:54,895
MATT: That's okay.

1350
01:39:54,895 --> 01:39:57,644
WIL: All right, so that's ten.

1351
01:39:57,644 --> 01:40:02,387
MATT: So ten damage to you. Goading attack, it
failed its saving throw. It rolled an 11.

1352
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:09,593
It failed its saving throw. As you slam, you
can see the spiritual anger in the eyes (growls)

1353
01:40:09,593 --> 01:40:11,923
turn towards you, and it's focused on you at the
moment.

1354
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:26,565
WIL: And I'm going to make my third attack. So
everyone knows that things have gotten back to

1355
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:27,577
normal.

1356
01:40:27,577 --> 01:40:29,488
WILL: The world is right again!

1357
01:40:29,488 --> 01:40:30,466
WIL: Everything's fine.

1358
01:40:30,466 --> 01:40:36,736
MATT: The third strike, you swing and you swear
it's going right for the torso of Vax, and for a

1359
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,744
second you almost want to restrain because you're
afraid of what it's going to do, before all of a

1360
01:40:39,744 --> 01:40:52,352
sudden both daggers catch the axe in midair and scissor-hold it
before it shoves off the blade. However, it does

1361
01:40:52,409 --> 01:40:56,614
appear to be focused on you. Does that end your
turn?

1362
01:40:56,614 --> 01:41:03,799
WIL: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to expend another
superiority die. I'm sorry, this is a whole new

1363
01:41:03,799 --> 01:41:04,683
mechanic.

1364
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:06,969
MATT: That's okay. It's a new mechanic for me, too.

1365
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:12,861
WIL: Okay, so I add one more to my damage roll,
and that was it. That was the only attack that

1366
01:41:12,861 --> 01:41:13,717
landed.

1367
01:41:13,717 --> 01:41:16,278
MATT: All right, that brings us to Brother Kash.

1368
01:41:16,278 --> 01:41:18,820
WILL: Who still can't move, correct?

1369
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,218
MATT: You can't move closer.

1370
01:41:20,218 --> 01:41:25,078
WILL: Well, what I'd like to do is, if I know I'm
going to be rolling everything essentially at a

1371
01:41:25,078 --> 01:41:29,246
disadvantage, I'd like to at least help the people
that are still standing as much as I can, so I'd

1372
01:41:29,246 --> 01:41:37,534
like to Bless Stormwind and Thorbir. And can I do
myself, as well? It's up to three creatures.

1373
01:41:37,534 --> 01:41:38,684
MATT: Then yes, you can.

1374
01:41:38,684 --> 01:41:40,169
WILL: And myself, as well.

1375
01:41:40,169 --> 01:41:45,673
MATT: Okay, so you are all currently affected by a
Bless spell. What a Bless spell does-- if you want

1376
01:41:45,673 --> 01:41:47,282
to read it real fast.

1377
01:41:47,282 --> 01:41:50,565
WILL: Bless up to three creatures of your choice
within range. Whenever a target makes an attack

1378
01:41:50,622 --> 01:41:55,814
roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the
target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to

1379
01:41:55,814 --> 01:41:58,195
the attack roll or saving throw.

1380
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,672
LIAM: It's hard to accept love from others when
you hate yourself.

1381
01:42:00,672 --> 01:42:03,533
WIL: No one hates themselves as much as I do.

1382
01:42:03,533 --> 01:42:05,384
MATT: All right, so do you want to move?

1383
01:42:05,384 --> 01:42:09,910
WILL: I can only move back and forth, right? Then
let me stay there so I can concentrate as much as

1384
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:11,379
I can on holding the blessing.

1385
01:42:11,379 --> 01:42:12,846
MARISHA: An attack roll or saving throw?

1386
01:42:12,846 --> 01:42:13,784
MATT: Yes.

1387
01:42:13,784 --> 01:42:16,987
MARISHA: Can he target me? And would it work for
my saving throws?

1388
01:42:16,987 --> 01:42:19,731
MATT: I think you have to be a conscious creature
for the Bless spell to affect you. You do,

1389
01:42:19,731 --> 01:42:23,476
however, get your saving throw at the end of your
turn to try to shrug off the fright, so roll that.

1390
01:42:23,476 --> 01:42:25,612
And you can add a d4 to it.

1391
01:42:25,612 --> 01:42:27,243
WILL: So it's a d20 plus a four.

1392
01:42:27,243 --> 01:42:30,431
MATT: Yeah, with your wisdom, and then add a d4 to
it.

1393
01:42:30,431 --> 01:42:37,938
WILL: 19. Was that right? And wait, it's for
wisdom?

1394
01:42:37,938 --> 01:42:39,064
MATT: Yes.

1395
01:42:39,064 --> 01:42:45,697
WILL: So it's 19, then, plus-- where is wisdom?
Plus nine, so 28.

1396
01:42:45,697 --> 01:42:46,782
MATT: Okay, yeah.

1397
01:42:46,782 --> 01:42:48,536
WILL: Plus d4, right?

1398
01:42:48,536 --> 01:42:50,892
MATT: Plus d4 if you want to add it. Go for it.

1399
01:42:50,892 --> 01:42:52,419
WILL: One. 29.

1400
01:42:52,419 --> 01:42:56,469
MATT: You slam your foot into the ground for a
second and focus, and for a second the divine

1401
01:42:56,469 --> 01:43:00,365
energy pulses through your body, and you let a
little bit of Vesh's essence seep into you,

1402
01:43:00,365 --> 01:43:06,908
against your better judgment. It gives you that
sense of bravery to shrug off the fear you felt,

1403
01:43:06,908 --> 01:43:14,487
and for a second there, you're like, as a healing
cleric, undead should be afraid of you. And you

1404
01:43:14,487 --> 01:43:19,635
remember that there's an ability that you have
called Turn Undead that may come in handy, going

1405
01:43:19,635 --> 01:43:25,153
forward. That ends your turn. Keyleth, make
another saving throw.

1406
01:43:25,153 --> 01:43:36,180
MARISHA: (sighs) Let's use this one. This is a
big, shiny die. 17.

1407
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:39,168
MATT: 17? Okay. So you're still unconscious.

1408
01:43:39,168 --> 01:43:42,365
MARISHA: I'm good!

1409
01:43:42,365 --> 01:43:48,121
MATT: Tiberius, you're up. (louder) Tiberius!
You're up.

1410
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:52,538
ORION: Keyleth is right next to me, right?

1411
01:43:52,538 --> 01:43:57,814
MATT: She's currently on the ground. You can see a
little bit of blood trickling out the corner of

1412
01:43:57,814 --> 01:44:02,309
her mouth from the injury she sustained from the
crushing pillar. You can see a little of the light

1413
01:44:02,309 --> 01:44:04,087
fading from her eyes.

1414
01:44:04,087 --> 01:44:15,020
ORION: Vax is right next to me, also? Can I move,
probably take a hit from him,

1415
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,616
and drag her with me?

1416
01:44:16,616 --> 01:44:20,173
MATT: You can do that, yeah. That will be your
whole turn, but yeah, you can do that.

1417
01:44:20,173 --> 01:44:23,414
ORION: That's what I choose to do.

1418
01:44:23,414 --> 01:44:29,139
MATT: Okay. So Tiberius, you reach down, you grab
Keyleth's body, and you pull her back through the

1419
01:44:29,139 --> 01:44:34,746
hallway. You can get her, probably about
half-speed, which is 30, so 15 feet. That far

1420
01:44:34,746 --> 01:44:40,007
back, out of the fray. Go ahead and make an attack
of opportunity against Tiberius as he moves away.

1421
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:47,509
LIAM: Okay. That's shit. I rolled a 12.

1422
01:44:47,509 --> 01:44:52,959
MATT: Total of 12? Okay. As you swing back, you
dodge out of the way as you're pulling her along

1423
01:44:52,959 --> 01:45:05,612
the floor. That's your turn. This ghost entity
here does not get its possession back. It's going

1424
01:45:05,612 --> 01:45:09,251
to make a Withering Touch against you, Thorbir.

1425
01:45:09,251 --> 01:45:10,713
WIL: Damn it!

1426
01:45:10,713 --> 01:45:14,478
MATT: With a 13.

1427
01:45:14,478 --> 01:45:17,038
WIL: Against my--

1428
01:45:17,038 --> 01:45:18,097
MATT: Yeah.

1429
01:45:18,097 --> 01:45:19,283
WIL: No. 20.

1430
01:45:19,283 --> 01:45:22,973
MATT: As you reach out, you manage to pull back
with your axe and swing in its direction. It

1431
01:45:22,973 --> 01:45:29,059
dissipates its form for a second, and the attack
whiffs through the air. However, as you pull on

1432
01:45:29,059 --> 01:45:34,787
that side, Vax comes up from behind you. I want
you to go ahead and do two attacks against

1433
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:37,449
Thorbir, with advantage.

1434
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:40,519
LIAM: With advantage on both attacks or one?

1435
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:42,872
MATT: You currently have him flanked.

1436
01:45:42,872 --> 01:45:46,515
LIAM: Because of my ghost friend.

1437
01:45:46,515 --> 01:45:47,868
MATT: Yes.

1438
01:45:47,868 --> 01:45:53,675
LIAM: So the first is high.

1439
01:45:53,675 --> 01:45:55,078
MATT: That hits.

1440
01:45:55,078 --> 01:45:58,410
LIAM: 28. Second is a one.

1441
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:02,419
MATT: And another roll. They both have advantage
because you have him flanked.

1442
01:46:02,419 --> 01:46:07,637
LIAM: Come on, one. (mutters) 19.

1443
01:46:07,637 --> 01:46:10,946
MATT: Okay, so roll damage for both. First one
with sneak attack.

1444
01:46:10,946 --> 01:46:16,615
LIAM: Doesn't he have an armor class of 20?
Doesn't one of them miss? Wouldn't a 19 miss his

1445
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:17,489
20 armor?

1446
01:46:17,489 --> 01:46:19,013
MATT: It was a total 19. I thought you rolled a
19.

1447
01:46:19,013 --> 01:46:20,474
LIAM: No, one was a total 19.

1448
01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:23,294
MATT: Oh, then the second one doesn't hit. Just
the first one does.

1449
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:30,432
LIAM: So the first one does, and that is-- okay,
that's the lowest this could possibly be. Seven

1450
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:39,008
plus nine, 12, 16, 17, 24.

1451
01:46:39,008 --> 01:46:44,794
WIL: Ouch. That's a lot of damage.

1452
01:46:44,794 --> 01:46:52,047
MATT: All right, that ends the ghosts' turn.
Thorbir, you're up. You've now got the attention

1453
01:46:52,047 --> 01:46:55,862
of both spiritual entities and your possessed
friend, and they're both swarming around you at

1454
01:46:55,862 --> 01:46:56,722
the moment.

1455
01:46:56,722 --> 01:47:05,714
WIL: Okay, great. I have this deal. (chuckles) I'm
sorry, I don't remember what it's called. I have a

1456
01:47:05,714 --> 01:47:10,196
maneuver where if I hit a thing, I can hit a
second thing. Let's just see if I hit. I'm going

1457
01:47:10,196 --> 01:47:13,922
to go ahead and try to hit Vax again.

1458
01:47:13,922 --> 01:47:15,515
MATT: Okay.

1459
01:47:15,515 --> 01:47:20,694
WIL: Two is probably not going to hit him.
Probably not going to happen. I'm thinking two's

1460
01:47:20,694 --> 01:47:25,486
probably not going to be-- it's a total of 12, but
I'm still pretty confident that 12 doesn't hit

1461
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:30,572
him. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that misses. Okay,
let's try again. I get three attacks. That's

1462
01:47:30,572 --> 01:47:37,863
right. Let's see here. Oh, a four. Okay, so four.
Let's see, so that's 14. So I'm thinking the 14 is

1463
01:47:37,863 --> 01:47:46,903
probably not going to hit him. All right, let's
try one more time. Come on, right? And oh, that's

1464
01:47:46,903 --> 01:47:49,166
a seven. So that's a 17.

1465
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:51,080
LIAM: Tag.

1466
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,025
WIL: Oh!

1467
01:47:52,025 --> 01:47:54,818
MATT: You find purchase with your third strike
with your axe.

1468
01:47:54,818 --> 01:48:06,704
WIL: I just need time to warm up! I'm thinking
about my daughter. So I guess I hit you.

1469
01:48:06,704 --> 01:48:15,928
LIAM: I don't like this game. I don't really like
this episode.

1470
01:48:15,928 --> 01:48:29,623
WIL: I make a precision attack, so I can add one
more die to the roll.

1471
01:48:29,623 --> 01:48:33,781
LIAM: Come on, clock me, War and Peace. Let's do
this.

1472
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:35,252
WIL: I'm working on it.

1473
01:48:35,252 --> 01:48:36,687
MARISHA: War and Peace?

1474
01:48:36,687 --> 01:48:44,663
WIL: Oh, good. So that's a one on the d12, plus
six, seven, plus nine is 16.

1475
01:48:44,663 --> 01:48:47,605
MATT: 16 points of slashing damage to you.

1476
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:48,937
LIAM: Okay.

1477
01:48:48,937 --> 01:48:55,174
MATT: Do you wish to move, or are you going to
stay where you are, Thorbir?

1478
01:48:55,174 --> 01:48:58,578
WIL: I would like to no longer be flanked by them,
if that's at all possible.

1479
01:48:58,578 --> 01:49:04,095
So I will move back. Sure.

1480
01:49:04,095 --> 01:49:10,121
MATT: I'll say you can move there pretty safely.
Move the other way. All right, that brings us to

1481
01:49:10,121 --> 01:49:12,209
Kashaw.

1482
01:49:12,209 --> 01:49:16,523
WILL: Okay. I'm going to Channel Divinity: Turn
Undead.

1483
01:49:16,523 --> 01:49:18,725
MATT: Turn Undead. Okay, what's the radius on
that?

1484
01:49:18,725 --> 01:49:19,872
WILL: 30 feet.

1485
01:49:19,872 --> 01:49:22,774
MATT: 30 feet. You're probably going to have to
move a little closer to get them both in there.

1486
01:49:22,774 --> 01:49:27,118
WILL: I want to get as close as I can, right on
the 30-foot radius.

1487
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:31,247
MATT: All right. Not a problem. So you're going to
go ahead and Turn Undead. As you reach up and grab

1488
01:49:31,247 --> 01:49:35,097
your holy symbol, pulling it out from under your
armor once again, clutching it tightly, you can

1489
01:49:35,097 --> 01:49:39,522
feel the blood begin to pour from the inside of
your hand, you're holding it so hard. And with a

1490
01:49:39,522 --> 01:49:47,555
flash of extremely vibrant white light with this
strange halo of pitch black that surrounds it, a

1491
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:52,462
force wave billows out from you throughout the
hallway. For a brief moment, you see Vax look

1492
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:57,276
over, and his eyes widen for a second as the blast
wave hits him.

1493
01:49:57,276 --> 01:50:01,902
WILL: You're stronger than that.

1494
01:50:01,902 --> 01:50:04,959
LIAM: You have a fan.

1495
01:50:04,959 --> 01:50:09,651
WILL: I just think it would be funny. Hit pedals
like a guitar. You can just change your thing.

1496
01:50:09,651 --> 01:50:13,325
Fan. Rain.

1497
01:50:13,325 --> 01:50:24,135
MATT: Both fail. All right. So suddenly, as the
blast wave hits Vax, the spirit is forced out of

1498
01:50:24,135 --> 01:50:29,695
his body against the wall. It pushes it out, and
all of a sudden, you have control of your form

1499
01:50:29,695 --> 01:50:36,575
again. Blown against the wall, and they both
halfway slide into the wall. They both have a

1500
01:50:36,575 --> 01:50:44,466
severe look of fear on their face. That's going to
end your turn. Keyleth,

1501
01:50:44,466 --> 01:50:46,374
make another saving throw.

1502
01:50:46,374 --> 01:50:49,890
MARISHA: Eight.

1503
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,466
MATT: So a second failed death saving throw.

1504
01:50:52,466 --> 01:50:54,775
MARISHA: Someone pump some life into me!

1505
01:50:54,775 --> 01:50:56,529
MATT: Tiberius.

1506
01:50:56,529 --> 01:51:03,404
ORION: Yeah, I'm going to pop one of my simple
potions.

1507
01:51:03,404 --> 01:51:06,188
MATT: Okay, just the level one?

1508
01:51:06,188 --> 01:51:07,300
ORION: Yeah.

1509
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:10,538
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll. That is 2d4
plus two.

1510
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:15,700
ORION: Okay. That's seven.

1511
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,638
MATT: Seven? Okay, you heal seven hit points. You
come to consciousness.

1512
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:19,855
MARISHA: (gasps)

1513
01:51:19,855 --> 01:51:27,843
MATT: You get rid of the saving throws. You look
around. Your eyes focus and you can see now,

1514
01:51:27,843 --> 01:51:31,532
there's these two glowing entities, the ghosts
that attacked. The one that was inside you is now

1515
01:51:31,532 --> 01:51:37,309
over against the wall and looks like it's
dissipating and is extremely frightened by

1516
01:51:37,309 --> 01:51:38,414
something.

1517
01:51:38,414 --> 01:51:40,267
ORION: Can I use the rest of my turn to help her
up?

1518
01:51:40,267 --> 01:51:43,367
MATT: Sure. You go ahead and prop her up to her
feet.

1519
01:51:43,367 --> 01:51:46,245
ORION: All right, and that's my turn.

1520
01:51:46,245 --> 01:51:53,731
MATT: Okay. For their turn, they both fade into
the wall and vanish from sight.

1521
01:51:53,731 --> 01:52:03,840
MARISHA: They were so cold.

1522
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:09,727
MATT: So all of you take a moment of stillness, as
the spiritual entities seem to have vanished into

1523
01:52:09,727 --> 01:52:10,983
the wall.

1524
01:52:10,983 --> 01:52:12,217
MARISHA: Oh, they left?

1525
01:52:12,217 --> 01:52:17,916
MATT: They left after he blasted them with his
shockwave of positive energy. They just went into

1526
01:52:17,916 --> 01:52:18,907
the wall.

1527
01:52:18,907 --> 01:52:20,953
MARISHA: You scared them with positive energy?

1528
01:52:20,953 --> 01:52:24,574
WILL: Unfortunately, the only kind of energy I'm
allowed to use, most of the time.

1529
01:52:24,574 --> 01:52:30,303
LIAM: You told me, when I pick-pocketed that guy
topside, it was a healing potion. It was blue,

1530
01:52:30,303 --> 01:52:32,226
right? That's what you told me.

1531
01:52:32,226 --> 01:52:34,122
MATT: Yeah.

1532
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:38,793
LIAM: I'm pulling that out of my pocket and
walking over to that door in a daze and I just

1533
01:52:38,793 --> 01:52:41,705
down it, push the door open with my foot.

1534
01:52:41,705 --> 01:52:46,426
MATT: Okay. That is a greater healing potion. 4d4
plus four.

1535
01:52:46,426 --> 01:52:48,893
ORION and MARISHA: Are you moving forward?

1536
01:52:48,893 --> 01:52:51,198
LIAM: No. Well, yeah. Sort of.

1537
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:54,412
ORION: Vex, no! Stop! What are you doing?

1538
01:52:54,453 --> 01:52:56,390
LIAM: My name is Vax! And I keep going.

1539
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,824
ORION: That's what I said.

1540
01:52:57,824 --> 01:53:04,664
MATT: Okay, you kick the door open. You have very
little light source in here, but with your vision,

1541
01:53:04,664 --> 01:53:09,186
you manage to look in past there, and it looks
like it's a hallway that was once used for storage

1542
01:53:09,186 --> 01:53:16,239
of some kind, but the first thing that catches you
is that strange chemical smell is extremely strong

1543
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:20,818
in this room, and your eyes burn as soon as the
doorway opens and you have to close your eyes.

1544
01:53:20,818 --> 01:53:23,456
Thorbir, you see Vax kick the door open.

1545
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,011
MARISHA: Wait. Vax, slow down.

1546
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:26,065
WIL: I follow him.

1547
01:53:26,065 --> 01:53:27,113
MARISHA: You guys.

1548
01:53:27,113 --> 01:53:28,831
ORION: I do not follow.

1549
01:53:28,831 --> 01:53:32,737
MATT: You do not follow? Okay, Tiberius stays
back. You guys are all staying there?

1550
01:53:32,737 --> 01:53:36,836
WILL: I'd like to call everyone together, if I
could, first. Let's take a moment.

1551
01:53:36,836 --> 01:53:41,637
LIAM: I'm just looking. I take another potion,
because I have one more. And I'm going to look

1552
01:53:41,637 --> 01:53:42,627
down the hall.

1553
01:53:42,627 --> 01:53:45,425
WIL: Wait, friend. I give him a potion of superior
healing.

1554
01:53:45,425 --> 01:53:50,587
WILL: You know I'm a healer, right? You can save
your potions.

1555
01:53:50,587 --> 01:53:55,032
LIAM: Save it. What's that? Superior is a 4d4?

1556
01:53:55,032 --> 01:54:00,209
MATT: Superior's another 4d4, yeah. You guys can
take a short rest, if you wish to, and also use

1557
01:54:00,209 --> 01:54:01,597
your hit dice.

1558
01:54:01,597 --> 01:54:07,708
MARISHA: Can I get some healing? Will you use some
of that positive energy on me?

1559
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,056
WILL: Of course I will.

1560
01:54:09,056 --> 01:54:11,378
ORION: I will go no further until I take a proper
rest.

1561
01:54:11,378 --> 01:54:13,562
LIAM: I'm just going to look down that hall.

1562
01:54:13,562 --> 01:54:18,391
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, as you enter the
room, and your Darkvision looks out, you see the

1563
01:54:18,391 --> 01:54:26,968
room that has that strong chemical scent, parts of
the wall have crumbled in sections, ruining this

1564
01:54:26,968 --> 01:54:33,127
long, empty hallway. You can see there are
elements of broken boxes and crates that have been

1565
01:54:33,127 --> 01:54:38,680
sundered or removed or destroyed in the collapse.
But what catches your attention, too, is a large

1566
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:45,324
portion of the floor seems to be lower than the
rest of it. There is some sort of a liquid that

1567
01:54:45,324 --> 01:54:49,835
has largely overtaken the entirety of this room.
Something has seeped through from some unseen

1568
01:54:49,835 --> 01:54:56,518
source, and has slowly, over time, dissolved a
large pit into the center of this hallway. This

1569
01:54:56,518 --> 01:55:04,614
dull yellowish-green liquid now fills the entirety
of the center portion of this hallway for a good,

1570
01:55:04,614 --> 01:55:11,484
let's say, about that distance, there.

1571
01:55:11,484 --> 01:55:16,610
LIAM: Okay. I put my hand on Thorbir's hand and
guide him back out and shut the door and say, it's

1572
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,304
fucking acid in that room. I just sit on the
ground.

1573
01:55:21,304 --> 01:55:23,333
WIL: Of course it is.

1574
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,640
MARISHA: Vax?

1575
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:35,505
LIAM: I'm back in the hall with you. Acid-filled
room. I'm going to rest. Let's all just take a

1576
01:55:35,505 --> 01:55:36,364
breather.

1577
01:55:36,364 --> 01:55:39,563
MARISHA: Can we make camp? I'm hurting really
bad.

1578
01:55:39,563 --> 01:55:41,513
WILL: Let's take a moment here.

1579
01:55:41,513 --> 01:55:44,457
ORION: I agree. We've been hit pretty hard, pretty
quickly.

1580
01:55:44,457 --> 01:55:47,467
LIAM: Do you want to camp, or do you want to take
a breather?

1581
01:55:47,467 --> 01:55:55,035
MARISHA: Just take a rest. Actually, I have
something that I think will make us all feel

1582
01:55:55,035 --> 01:55:58,834
better. And I prepare a Heroes' Feast.

1583
01:55:58,834 --> 01:56:01,133
ORION: You have those?

1584
01:56:01,133 --> 01:56:02,479
MARISHA: I do now.

1585
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:07,000
ORION: What does that do?

1586
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,580
MARISHA: I'll tell you.

1587
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,627
ORION: Are there bananas?

1588
01:56:10,686 --> 01:56:13,763
LIAM: It's a 20-foot-long hoagie.

1589
01:56:13,763 --> 01:56:18,469
MARISHA: Yes, it's the 20-foot-long Subway
dealio.

1590
01:56:18,469 --> 01:56:20,562
WILL: No, not Subway.

1591
01:56:20,562 --> 01:56:21,684
LIAM: Too soon.

1592
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:24,124
(laughter)

1593
01:56:24,124 --> 01:56:31,318
MATT: Marisha. Just a heads-up. One of the
material components is a gem-encrusted bowl that

1594
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:36,748
costs 1000 gold pieces that is consumed by it. You
can totally cast this, but you'll have to deduct a

1595
01:56:36,748 --> 01:56:38,798
thousand gold off your personal gold supply.

1596
01:56:38,798 --> 01:56:41,662
WILL: How much money have you got?

1597
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,598
MARISHA: Like 3k, I think.

1598
01:56:43,598 --> 01:56:46,414
WILL: You have 3k? You said you were single?

1599
01:56:46,414 --> 01:56:51,069
MARISHA: All right, fine. I'll do it.

1600
01:56:51,069 --> 01:56:52,295
MATT: All right.

1601
01:56:52,295 --> 01:57:00,203
MARISHA: You guys, I've just had a near-death
experience. I've been craving some lasagna. Okay?

1602
01:57:00,203 --> 01:57:04,855
So I'm going to make some of the best goddamn
lasagna we've ever had in our life. I'm going to

1603
01:57:04,855 --> 01:57:09,407
spend a thousand dollars and make some amazing
fucking lasagna.

1604
01:57:09,452 --> 01:57:11,106
ORION: What are dollars?

1605
01:57:11,106 --> 01:57:12,774
MARISHA: A thousand gold.

1606
01:57:12,774 --> 01:57:13,993
WILL: What's lasagna?

1607
01:57:13,993 --> 01:57:18,046
LIAM: It's a tribal food that her people eat. It's
vegetarian.

1608
01:57:18,094 --> 01:57:21,718
WILL: If she's spending the money, I'll eat.

1609
01:57:21,718 --> 01:57:27,590
MATT: So as you guys take a few moments to tend to
your wounds and catch your breath, Keyleth finds a

1610
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:35,332
section of the center of this dank, dreary prison
and concentrates, taking this gem-encrusted bowl

1611
01:57:35,332 --> 01:57:38,945
and setting it in the center of the floor. As time
goes on, you begin to see this strange, shimmering

1612
01:57:38,945 --> 01:57:44,220
energy in the center of the room. At the end of
the ritual, she raises her hand in the air, and

1613
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:50,432
through a plume of whitish-silver smoke that
slowly dissipates, you can now see there is a long

1614
01:57:50,432 --> 01:57:57,026
table. A very well-crafted table in the center of
the room, with chairs and benches, and an

1615
01:57:57,026 --> 01:58:06,022
extremely well-prepared, incredible-smelling meal.
Fruits and breads and meats all just strewn about

1616
01:58:06,022 --> 01:58:08,604
this table in the center of this prison.

1617
01:58:08,604 --> 01:58:16,018
MARISHA: Okay, everybody. Close your eyes. Okay?
Tiberius, will you make the little forks dance for

1618
01:58:16,018 --> 01:58:18,645
me with Mage Hand?

1619
01:58:18,645 --> 01:58:20,964
ORION: Sure.

1620
01:58:20,964 --> 01:58:28,117
MARISHA: Okay. Are you guys ready? (singing) Be
our guest, be our guest,

1621
01:58:28,117 --> 01:58:30,421
put our service to the test!

1622
01:58:30,421 --> 01:58:34,033
WILL: Is this a thing? Is this happening right
now?

1623
01:58:34,033 --> 01:58:40,062
MARISHA: Look, I'm making a musical out of our
food. People pay a lot of money for this.

1624
01:58:40,062 --> 01:58:42,528
LIAM: She set it out. Have a seat. Eat the food.

1625
01:58:42,528 --> 01:58:44,672
ORION: Thank you, Keyleth.

1626
01:58:44,672 --> 01:58:47,231
MARISHA: I thought that was funny.

1627
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:49,630
LIAM: I just start eating. I'm wiped out.

1628
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,916
MATT: All right. You guys can use as many hit dice
as you want to heal yourself. If you check on your

1629
01:58:52,916 --> 01:58:57,322
sheet, it has a hit dice number. Use those to heal
yourself naturally.

1630
01:58:57,322 --> 01:59:04,831
MARISHA: So after we eat all of this food, we are
cured of all diseases and poisons. We become

1631
01:59:04,831 --> 01:59:13,515
immune to poison and being frightened, and all of
our wisdom saving throws have advantage. Also, our

1632
01:59:13,515 --> 01:59:16,596
maximum hit points increase by 2d10.

1633
01:59:16,596 --> 01:59:18,169
WILL: For how long?

1634
01:59:18,169 --> 01:59:25,628
MARISHA: 24 hours. And you gain the same number of
hit points. So don't spend any of your hit dice.

1635
01:59:25,628 --> 01:59:29,338
We're going to eat our way to health.

1636
01:59:29,338 --> 01:59:32,690
MATT: Well, no. You still spend your hit dice.
Meaning, you gain 2d10 hit points.

1637
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:37,114
MARISHA: And it gains the same number of hit
points. Oh.

1638
01:59:37,114 --> 01:59:39,603
MATT: So you increase the maximum and you heal up
what you gained.

1639
01:59:39,603 --> 01:59:41,870
MARISHA: Okay. I see what it means.

1640
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:43,972
WILL: So how do you heal yourself, then?

1641
01:59:43,972 --> 01:59:49,987
MATT: Where it says hit dice, on your page? It
should be toward the middle, right above your

1642
01:59:49,987 --> 01:59:50,641
attacks.

1643
01:59:50,641 --> 01:59:51,553
WILL: Yeah.

1644
01:59:51,553 --> 01:59:56,684
MATT: You can spend up to your top level and you
roll a dice with the number you have for your hit

1645
01:59:56,684 --> 01:59:59,580
dice, and you heal that much. So what's the number
that you have there?

1646
01:59:59,643 --> 02:00:02,936
WILL: Total is 11. 1d8 plus three.

1647
02:00:02,936 --> 02:00:07,590
MATT: So you can spend up to 11 if you want to,
and heal up that much naturally.

1648
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:09,463
WILL: But I wasn't taking any damage. That's the
thing.

1649
02:00:09,463 --> 02:00:12,008
MATT: Then you don't have to worry about it.
You're fine.

1650
02:00:12,008 --> 02:00:17,172
MARISHA: Why did you burn all of your sorcerer
points? We told you not to burn all of your

1651
02:00:17,172 --> 02:00:21,095
sorcerer points. We don't have time to sit here
and take a full rest.

1652
02:00:21,095 --> 02:00:28,936
WILL: I can still cure everybody, you know. I can
heal everybody. The wounds.

1653
02:00:28,936 --> 02:00:33,589
MATT: Use your hit dice to heal yourself. You
commence on the meal, and

1654
02:00:33,589 --> 02:00:37,773
it is a very delightful meal.

1655
02:00:37,773 --> 02:00:46,191
MARISHA: You can ask the group, but I have a
feeling that Vax and Thorbir aren't going to want

1656
02:00:46,191 --> 02:00:47,859
to take a full rest down here.

1657
02:00:47,859 --> 02:00:51,091
LIAM: He's going to get gone. That guy or that
gal.

1658
02:00:51,091 --> 02:00:52,543
WILL: Both of them.

1659
02:00:52,543 --> 02:00:54,377
WIL: It's a thing.

1660
02:00:54,377 --> 02:00:57,930
LIAM: I don't want to go on a date with it. I want
to kill it.

1661
02:00:57,930 --> 02:01:01,539
WILL: So while we're sitting here, can I cast
Locate Creature? Oh, wait. Here's a question that

1662
02:01:01,539 --> 02:01:09,457
I have. How much time has passed since the last
time I cast it?

1663
02:01:09,457 --> 02:01:14,742
MATT: I'd say, with shopping time, it's probably
been about six hours.

1664
02:01:14,742 --> 02:01:16,797
LIAM: We're on the clock, here.

1665
02:01:16,797 --> 02:01:19,457
MATT: How long does it last?

1666
02:01:19,457 --> 02:01:21,190
ORION: We're still on day one.

1667
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:23,740
WILL: It lasts for up to an hour.

1668
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:25,330
MATT: So yeah, you'd have to re-cast it.

1669
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:34,164
WILL: Yeah. But that's my question. My level-4
spells, I cast three of them last game, so do I

1670
02:01:34,164 --> 02:01:39,689
get those back for this one? They're gone, right?
I can't cast. So that's what I thought. I can't

1671
02:01:39,689 --> 02:01:42,265
cast Locate Creature. I wish I could help.

1672
02:01:42,265 --> 02:01:47,871
MATT: Yeah, Locate Creature currently cannot be
cast. You spent all your 4th level.

1673
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:53,708
LIAM: How long does everything last from that
feast, Keyleth?

1674
02:01:53,708 --> 02:02:00,736
MARISHA: 24 hours. So we can still take a long
rest and still have benefits from the feast. It

1675
02:02:00,736 --> 02:02:02,830
lasts for 24 hours.

1676
02:02:02,830 --> 02:02:06,620
WIL: If we wait, it escapes.

1677
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:09,997
WILL: He's a day longer away, and we only have
three days to do this.

1678
02:02:09,997 --> 02:02:18,988
WIL: And who's to say more guards won't come down.
How will we explain ourselves to them? And what if

1679
02:02:18,988 --> 02:02:20,868
those things come back?

1680
02:02:20,868 --> 02:02:24,296
MARISHA: I actually have a Locate Creature spell.
I can do it.

1681
02:02:24,296 --> 02:02:28,987
ORION: Well, I'll tell you this, everyone. I have
only a limited amount of spells left to be

1682
02:02:28,987 --> 02:02:34,782
effective in a fight against a creature like this.
I have no melee offenses towards this creature,

1683
02:02:34,782 --> 02:02:41,749
whatsoever, so that's going to be up to you with
magical weapons and whatnot, I'm assuming. I'm

1684
02:02:41,749 --> 02:02:48,802
virtually tapped out of all my spells. So is the
cleric, as well. So if we move forward, that's

1685
02:02:48,802 --> 02:02:51,304
fine. We're only six hours in on the first day of
this contract.

1686
02:02:51,304 --> 02:02:56,135
MARISHA: Well, the cleric is burned out of
4th-level spells. Cleric is good.

1687
02:02:56,135 --> 02:03:02,843
WILL: It's time or it's strength. That's what
we're talking about. We wait and we go in, fully

1688
02:03:02,843 --> 02:03:10,873
charged. Or we go now and we have a much better
chance of catching up to it, but weakened.

1689
02:03:10,873 --> 02:03:19,188
ORION: I will follow the group.

1690
02:03:19,188 --> 02:03:21,400
WILL: As will I.

1691
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,823
WILL: You're in charge. What do you say?

1692
02:03:24,868 --> 02:03:27,130
WIL: Oh, now I'm in charge?

1693
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:31,119
WILL: You've always been in charge. Because you
chose not to lead was your own fault.

1694
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:32,387
WIL: We go.

1695
02:03:32,387 --> 02:03:33,949
WILL: We go.

1696
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:36,415
MARISHA: Can I get another healing spell, then,
Cashew?

1697
02:03:36,415 --> 02:03:39,722
WILL: Why don't I do Mass Cure Wounds on
everybody?

1698
02:03:39,722 --> 02:03:41,659
MARISHA: Oh, that would be great.

1699
02:03:41,659 --> 02:03:42,847
LIAM: I'm already good.

1700
02:03:42,847 --> 02:03:43,987
WILL: You're good?

1701
02:03:43,987 --> 02:03:49,492
LIAM: Yeah. I flip my last potion to Keyleth. It's
a superior.

1702
02:03:49,492 --> 02:03:52,867
MARISHA: So what are those? 2d8?

1703
02:03:52,867 --> 02:03:56,124
MATT: It's 8d4 plus eight. Did you use your hit
dice to heal yourself?

1704
02:03:56,124 --> 02:03:58,132
MARISHA: I did. 8d4?

1705
02:03:58,132 --> 02:04:01,952
MATT: 8d4 plus eight. Big heal.

1706
02:04:01,952 --> 02:04:05,391
WILL: Let's see if you're even going to need me to
mass cure.

1707
02:04:05,391 --> 02:04:18,218
MARISHA: (quietly) Let me get more d4s out. I'll
do this twice. That will be enough. Four, five,

1708
02:04:18,218 --> 02:04:35,693
six, seven, eight, nine. Oh, that's good. Eight,
so that's 15, 19, 22, plus another eight?

1709
02:04:35,693 --> 02:04:38,224
MATT: Plus another eight, yeah.

1710
02:04:38,224 --> 02:04:44,754
MARISHA: So 30. Cool. Awesome.

1711
02:04:44,754 --> 02:04:48,168
WILL: So is everybody good? Anybody need healing?

1712
02:04:48,168 --> 02:04:49,526
ORION: I'm fine.

1713
02:04:49,526 --> 02:04:51,068
WILL: You sure?

1714
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:53,996
MARISHA: I mean, you knew we were on a time
crunch, Tiberius.

1715
02:04:53,996 --> 02:04:55,702
ORION: We have days left.

1716
02:04:55,702 --> 02:04:58,688
MARISHA: We were chasing him down a hall.

1717
02:04:58,688 --> 02:05:06,165
LIAM: We don't have an egg timer. He just ran down
here. He could fly to Timbuktu. Go to Kraghammer.

1718
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:08,529
Hang out with Johnny Kraghammer.

1719
02:05:08,529 --> 02:05:15,700
ORION: (laughs) I like Johnny Kraghammer.

1720
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:17,852
WILL: Johnny Kraghammer.

1721
02:05:17,852 --> 02:05:28,415
LIAM: Long story, Kash. Let's go. I'm going to
slowly push that door open and try to use

1722
02:05:28,415 --> 02:05:30,459
perception in the room.

1723
02:05:30,459 --> 02:05:31,573
MATT: In this room?

1724
02:05:31,573 --> 02:05:33,489
LIAM: Yeah. If that crud is moving.

1725
02:05:33,489 --> 02:05:35,950
MATT: Okay. Were you about to do something,
Keyleth?

1726
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:38,655
LIAM: And try to see a door on the far end.

1727
02:05:38,655 --> 02:05:47,375
MARISHA: Actually, you know what? Here's what I'm
going to do instead. Let me double-check and make

1728
02:05:47,375 --> 02:05:49,518
sure I can do this.

1729
02:05:49,518 --> 02:05:56,560
MATT: As you look inside, you walk up to the
liquid. It looks like there is a very slow flow to

1730
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:07,334
it, coming at an angle. It's very thick and looks
like it's melted through the basis of the floor

1731
02:06:07,334 --> 02:06:17,027
and almost like it would continue under, around,
and out of this room into whatever is beyond. You

1732
02:06:17,027 --> 02:06:21,790
get a feeling there is something to why this part
of the prison was probably abandoned.

1733
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:28,842
LIAM: Wait a tic. Wait a sec. I back out slowly,
and I'm going to creep back to the other door.

1734
02:06:28,842 --> 02:06:36,182
That other one, yeah. Perception check there, as
well. That's 16.

1735
02:06:36,182 --> 02:06:41,265
MATT: Okay. The door is not currently locked.

1736
02:06:41,265 --> 02:06:45,845
LIAM: Okay, and does that count for the traps, as
well?

1737
02:06:45,845 --> 02:06:47,452
MATT: Yeah, it's not trapped, either.

1738
02:06:47,452 --> 02:06:49,642
LIAM: Okay, so I'm going to open it an inch and
see what I can see.

1739
02:06:49,642 --> 02:06:55,015
MATT: Look inside. There is a large collapsed pile
of rubble. Whatever this room once was has

1740
02:06:55,015 --> 02:07:02,842
entirely collapsed on itself. You can see, it's
pushed up against the door. Something made this

1741
02:07:02,842 --> 02:07:04,872
room inert, and it's not currently functional.

1742
02:07:04,872 --> 02:07:06,229
LIAM: Acid, it is.

1743
02:07:06,229 --> 02:07:08,037
WILL: Acid alley is the only way to go.

1744
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:12,478
WIL: Wait, there's a door at the end of this
hallway.

1745
02:07:12,478 --> 02:07:14,343
LIAM: That's what I just looked in.

1746
02:07:14,343 --> 02:07:16,683
WIL: A third door.

1747
02:07:16,683 --> 02:07:18,719
LIAM: Oh, a third door. I thought there was two.

1748
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:33,377
WIL: There's a third door. I once knew someone who
met a bad fate in acid. I would prefer to not

1749
02:07:33,377 --> 02:07:35,276
encounter it myself.

1750
02:07:35,276 --> 02:07:37,285
ORION: Yes, I agree.

1751
02:07:37,285 --> 02:07:40,709
WIL: He was a good man.

1752
02:07:40,709 --> 02:07:44,099
ORION: I heard he was brave. Very brave.

1753
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:46,389
WILL: I never heard about this. How did you hear
about this?

1754
02:07:46,389 --> 02:07:48,737
WIL: He was a good man who was murdered by the
gods.

1755
02:07:48,737 --> 02:07:50,374
ORION: It is legend.

1756
02:07:50,374 --> 02:07:53,205
WILL: The acid guy is legend? All right.

1757
02:07:53,205 --> 02:07:56,169
WIL: I go walking down the hallway, this way.

1758
02:07:56,169 --> 02:07:59,552
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing? You're
meditating?

1759
02:07:59,552 --> 02:08:03,131
MARISHA: Let me wait until he opens this door.

1760
02:08:03,131 --> 02:08:04,236
MATT: Okay.

1761
02:08:04,236 --> 02:08:06,005
WIL: I'll make a perception check at that door.

1762
02:08:06,005 --> 02:08:08,170
MATT: Go for it.

1763
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:10,966
WIL: 11.

1764
02:08:10,966 --> 02:08:17,489
MATT: All right. The door does not appear to be
trapped. You don't know if it's locked yet. It's

1765
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:18,632
hard to tell.

1766
02:08:18,632 --> 02:08:22,357
LIAM: Just, allow me. You're strong.

1767
02:08:22,357 --> 02:08:24,326
WIL: That's what they say.

1768
02:08:24,326 --> 02:08:27,827
LIAM: That's 27.

1769
02:08:27,827 --> 02:08:31,777
MATT: It is also, from your perspective, not
locked or trapped.

1770
02:08:31,777 --> 02:08:38,487
MARISHA: Okay, now I'm going to drop to my knees
and cast Locate Creature.

1771
02:08:38,487 --> 02:08:43,063
MATT: Okay. As you're finishing your small ritual
for Locate Creature, you open up the door, and it

1772
02:08:43,063 --> 02:08:47,922
is a spiral staircase that leads upward. You get
the sensation this is where those earlier Bastions

1773
02:08:47,985 --> 02:08:49,358
were coming from.

1774
02:08:49,358 --> 02:08:50,651
WILL: No acid.

1775
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:52,292
MATT: No acid in this room, no.

1776
02:08:52,292 --> 02:08:54,092
MARISHA: Just a staircase up?

1777
02:08:54,092 --> 02:08:59,546
MATT: You finish Locate Creature, and you sit
there, and you can sense, grasping on that one

1778
02:08:59,546 --> 02:09:05,399
encounter you had with the rakshasa, though it was
still disguised as a dwarf, and the descriptor you

1779
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:10,131
have. And you recognize this immediately. This is
the same type of ritual that you did earlier, and

1780
02:09:10,131 --> 02:09:14,510
so there's now this weird, synchronous moment that
you share magical knowledge.

1781
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:17,761
WILL: And she has money.

1782
02:09:17,761 --> 02:09:23,891
MATT: And she has money. Though a thousand less,
now. You finish your concentration for a second,

1783
02:09:23,891 --> 02:09:30,667
and the divine energy pulls you in a direction,
and it pulls you in the direction of this way.

1784
02:09:30,667 --> 02:09:38,793
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I think we're going to need to
go through the acid.

1785
02:09:38,793 --> 02:09:45,834
WIL: Very well.

1786
02:09:45,834 --> 02:09:59,349
LIAM: My armor is resistant to acid. Let me lead
the way. Is there any shit sitting around? Any

1787
02:09:59,349 --> 02:10:00,517
rubbish?

1788
02:10:00,517 --> 02:10:05,800
MATT: There are clumps of what looks like a
destroyed crate, pieces of stone that have fallen

1789
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,714
from the partially collapsed walls.

1790
02:10:07,714 --> 02:10:09,685
LIAM: I'm going to pull up a plank of that crate.

1791
02:10:09,685 --> 02:10:18,184
ORION: As he's doing this, I cast Fly on Thorbir,
Keyleth, the cleric, and Vax. And myself.

1792
02:10:18,184 --> 02:10:19,933
MATT: You can only cast it on three people.

1793
02:10:19,933 --> 02:10:21,242
ORION: I can cast it at 6th level.

1794
02:10:21,242 --> 02:10:24,309
MATT: 6th level. It's one additional person per
spell level.

1795
02:10:24,309 --> 02:10:27,758
ORION: I'm terrible at math. Not Vax.

1796
02:10:27,758 --> 02:10:33,177
WIL: With your math and my rolling, we are a
formidable team.

1797
02:10:33,177 --> 02:10:34,720
ORION: Us four.

1798
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:40,049
MATT: All right. It's a 3rd-level spell, so you
can do four. Okay. So against who?

1799
02:10:40,049 --> 02:10:43,634
LIAM: Everyone but me.

1800
02:10:43,634 --> 02:10:45,394
MATT: Everyone but you. Okay. So.

1801
02:10:45,394 --> 02:10:52,062
MARISHA: Oh, wait. We brought the flying carpet
with us. It's in your Bag of Holding.

1802
02:10:52,062 --> 02:10:54,087
WILL: You have a flying carpet?

1803
02:10:54,087 --> 02:10:56,065
ORION: Oh. Yes.

1804
02:10:56,065 --> 02:10:57,461
LIAM: Well, there's that.

1805
02:10:57,461 --> 02:11:00,769
WILL: That would be helpful. To fly over things.
Like pools of acid.

1806
02:11:00,769 --> 02:11:02,747
MARISHA: Why don't we pull that out?

1807
02:11:02,747 --> 02:11:04,309
WILL: Yeah. That's a good idea.

1808
02:11:04,309 --> 02:11:08,005
MATT: As you're pulling out the flying carpet,
we're going to go ahead and take a break. Quick

1809
02:11:08,005 --> 02:11:12,338
restroom break for about five minutes or so, and
we'll come right back to continue as they enter

1810
02:11:12,338 --> 02:11:18,748
the room with a rather large pit of acid. We'll be
back in five minutes, guys. See you in a second.

1811
02:11:18,748 --> 02:11:20,945
MARISHA: Acid pit!

1812
02:11:20,945 --> 02:21:01,967
[break]

1813
02:21:02,016 --> 02:21:06,299
MATT: Welcome back, guys! Before we get back to
the game, Orion, you want to talk

1814
02:21:06,299 --> 02:21:07,526
about that video?

1815
02:21:07,526 --> 02:21:13,075
ORION: Yeah. That Disney princess shit you saw was
Lewberger, and they're playing tomorrow at Gather

1816
02:21:13,075 --> 02:21:19,223
Your Party on this channel, and I will be
performing songs with Alex Lewis, who's half of

1817
02:21:19,223 --> 02:21:28,427
Lewberger, and I get to call Zac a dumdum for
once. Zac the dumdum played the one video that I'm

1818
02:21:28,427 --> 02:21:29,573
not in.

1819
02:21:29,573 --> 02:21:33,565
ZAC: Technically, the video I was sent ten minutes
before show started.

1820
02:21:33,565 --> 02:21:40,334
ORION: Was through Alex, so he's the dumdum now.
Sorry about that, for the confusion. That's what's

1821
02:21:40,334 --> 02:21:42,678
going on. You'll see me dance like a monkey
tomorrow.

1822
02:21:42,678 --> 02:21:47,740
MATT: Yeah. That's okay. It was a hell of a way to
break the tension, so it worked out well. All

1823
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:54,099
right, so as the rest of you have found your way
into this long, partially eroded hallway

1824
02:21:54,099 --> 02:22:03,008
containing this thick green viscous liquid, you
have pulled out the flying carpet?

1825
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:05,662
MARISHA: Yes. We all fit on it, right?

1826
02:22:05,662 --> 02:22:07,476
ORION: Oh yeah, we can all get on this one.

1827
02:22:07,476 --> 02:22:09,976
LIAM: Do you maybe want to sparrow across,
Keyleth?

1828
02:22:09,976 --> 02:22:14,709
MARISHA: Oh! We took a short rest. I could.

1829
02:22:14,709 --> 02:22:16,452
LIAM: Then I get to come.

1830
02:22:16,452 --> 02:22:19,481
WIL: What's happening?

1831
02:22:19,481 --> 02:22:22,096
MATT and MARISHA: We have flying carpets.

1832
02:22:22,096 --> 02:22:29,625
MATT: Built by some of our amazing Critters. I'm
going to go ahead and go with the crocheted one

1833
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:30,679
tonight.

1834
02:22:30,679 --> 02:22:33,480
WIL: That's fantastic.

1835
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:37,687
WILL: Crocheting is fantastic, and a wonderful way
to spend your time.

1836
02:22:37,687 --> 02:22:40,788
WIL: You guys have the best fans.

1837
02:22:40,788 --> 02:22:41,862
MATT: We really do.

1838
02:22:41,862 --> 02:22:43,478
LIAM: You guys are pretty great.

1839
02:22:43,478 --> 02:22:45,409
MARISHA: Okay, we all fit! We're good.

1840
02:22:45,409 --> 02:22:47,663
LIAM: Oh, we all fit on it? Oh, look at that.

1841
02:22:47,663 --> 02:22:49,900
MARISHA: Let's go.

1842
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:51,090
MATT: All right.

1843
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:52,068
MARISHA: Onward!

1844
02:22:52,068 --> 02:22:56,296
MATT: You drift down the hallway on the flying
carpet.

1845
02:22:56,296 --> 02:22:58,109
LIAM: Staring at the slime on the ground.

1846
02:22:58,109 --> 02:23:01,743
MATT: The air itself, like I said, it hurts. You
have to continuously rub your eyes

1847
02:23:01,743 --> 02:23:03,449
and keep them shut.

1848
02:23:03,449 --> 02:23:09,228
MARISHA: I make a nice little wind zephyr to give
us a little airflow.

1849
02:23:09,228 --> 02:23:16,465
MATT: Okay. As you move partway through this
section, everyone make a perception check.

1850
02:23:16,465 --> 02:23:19,096
ORION: Oh, natural 20.

1851
02:23:19,096 --> 02:23:20,429
WILL: Nice.

1852
02:23:20,429 --> 02:23:23,698
WILL: 19.

1853
02:23:23,698 --> 02:23:24,908
MARISHA: 19.

1854
02:23:24,908 --> 02:23:26,409
MATT: Who's helming the magic carpet, by the way?

1855
02:23:26,567 --> 02:23:27,887
LIAM: Looks like Kash is.

1856
02:23:27,887 --> 02:23:31,585
ORION: I am helming the damn magic carpet, of
course.

1857
02:23:31,585 --> 02:23:33,362
MATT: All right. So you're helming the magic
carpet.

1858
02:23:33,362 --> 02:23:35,756
WIL: I rolled a six plus a 12 total, 12.

1859
02:23:35,756 --> 02:23:37,474
MATT: And you rolled a total of what?

1860
02:23:37,474 --> 02:23:38,395
ORION: Natural 20.

1861
02:23:38,395 --> 02:23:39,363
MATT: Natural 20.

1862
02:23:39,363 --> 02:23:40,416
LIAM: 26.

1863
02:23:40,416 --> 02:23:45,850
MATT: So pulling forward, as you come around
through the sections of the wall that are

1864
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:53,746
collapsed in rubble, you notice that there are
some sigils in the wall. Two-foot-high

1865
02:23:53,746 --> 02:23:59,408
carved-stone sigils about five feet ahead of you
guys. There's one on each side.

1866
02:23:59,408 --> 02:24:01,767
ORION: Are they infernal?

1867
02:24:01,767 --> 02:24:08,140
MATT: It is not infernal. They are arcane in
nature, though. Make an arcana check.

1868
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:12,269
LIAM: Sometimes I really hate this old-world
shit.

1869
02:24:12,269 --> 02:24:14,165
WILL: Can I do a religion check on them?

1870
02:24:14,165 --> 02:24:15,551
MATT: You can, yes.

1871
02:24:15,551 --> 02:24:18,158
ORION: I got ten, so I figured.

1872
02:24:18,158 --> 02:24:20,329
WILL: 15.

1873
02:24:20,329 --> 02:24:27,986
MATT: Okay. There doesn't appear to be much
religious connotation to these symbols, but

1874
02:24:28,034 --> 02:24:34,285
they're old, and it looks like they were placed
there for a specific reason. That's as much as you

1875
02:24:34,342 --> 02:24:35,499
can get from it.

1876
02:24:35,499 --> 02:24:38,425
LIAM: Can I make out any traps or anything in the
ceilings or the walls?

1877
02:24:38,425 --> 02:24:42,237
MATT: You can make a perception check. Tiberius
points it out to the rest of you guys, and you can

1878
02:24:42,237 --> 02:24:43,154
see it.

1879
02:24:43,154 --> 02:24:44,867
LIAM: But nothing in addition to that.

1880
02:24:44,867 --> 02:24:49,086
MATT: No. Especially for you, your experience
doesn't fall too much in the realm of the arcane.

1881
02:24:49,086 --> 02:24:50,800
MARISHA: Could I do a history check?

1882
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:52,027
MATT: You can try.

1883
02:24:52,027 --> 02:24:53,423
MARISHA: Why not?

1884
02:24:53,423 --> 02:24:55,497
LIAM: How about handle animals, man?

1885
02:24:55,497 --> 02:24:57,623
MATT: Try every skill. Just go through the whole
list.

1886
02:24:57,623 --> 02:24:58,609
MARISHA: 12.

1887
02:24:58,609 --> 02:25:02,291
MATT: Yeah, there's nothing really historic about
this, other than the fact that you're in the

1888
02:25:02,291 --> 02:25:04,703
historic Amaranthine Oubliette prison here.

1889
02:25:04,703 --> 02:25:09,765
WIL: Did anyone make an arcana check? And we
didn't find anything out? Is this something that

1890
02:25:09,765 --> 02:25:13,493
my stonecunning skills would be relevant to?

1891
02:25:13,493 --> 02:25:20,562
MATT: It's not structural. In looking at it, it
looks like these were added to it once it was

1892
02:25:20,562 --> 02:25:24,054
built, although it is a storage room, so it's
strange that these would be placed in the center

1893
02:25:24,054 --> 02:25:25,244
of the room.

1894
02:25:25,244 --> 02:25:29,725
WIL: Would I make an insight check, perhaps? No,
that doesn't apply.

1895
02:25:29,725 --> 02:25:33,349
MATT: Insight's more for individuals and motives.

1896
02:25:33,349 --> 02:25:36,315
MARISHA: Wisdom saving throws. Continue.

1897
02:25:36,315 --> 02:25:47,826
WIL: I just don't want to be over this acid
anymore.

1898
02:25:47,826 --> 02:25:50,166
MATT: Okay, so you push forward?

1899
02:25:50,166 --> 02:25:53,034
LIAM: It's going to be all right.

1900
02:25:53,034 --> 02:25:55,340
WIL: That's what my friend thought.

1901
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:59,903
MATT: You push forward. You get about here as
you're passing through the two sigils, and there's

1902
02:25:59,903 --> 02:26:05,432
a flash from the sigils. They glow bright, and
it's almost like two flashbulbs go off from side

1903
02:26:05,432 --> 02:26:14,349
to side. You stop. The carpet dips. As in, the
carpet goes limp.

1904
02:26:14,349 --> 02:26:20,448
ORION: I cast Fly on all of us.

1905
02:26:20,448 --> 02:26:24,658
MATT: Okay. As the carpet goes limp, you all begin
to plummet forward. You need to go ahead and make

1906
02:26:24,658 --> 02:26:26,268
a concentration check.

1907
02:26:26,268 --> 02:26:28,173
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1908
02:26:28,173 --> 02:26:32,033
MATT: It's with your constitution modifier.

1909
02:26:32,033 --> 02:26:33,453
ORION: 16.

1910
02:26:33,453 --> 02:26:50,474
MATT: 16? Okay. So you cast Fly multiple times?
People begin to lift up, and then the spell fades.

1911
02:26:50,474 --> 02:26:59,809
There is something about these sigils that is
cancelling magic. However, the carpet is now going

1912
02:26:59,809 --> 02:27:06,293
limp and all of you are now plummeting down
towards the acidic surface below. Your action was

1913
02:27:06,293 --> 02:27:13,829
casting Fly. There is one piece of open ground
here that can fit maybe two people.

1914
02:27:13,829 --> 02:27:15,550
WIL: Thorbir dives for it.

1915
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:16,511
MATT: Okay.

1916
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:25,292
MARISHA: Can I cast Wall of Stone and make a big
stone underneath of us to support the carpet?

1917
02:27:25,292 --> 02:27:28,076
MATT: Go ahead and roll a concentration check.

1918
02:27:28,076 --> 02:27:37,169
MARISHA: Let's use this one. Add my what?

1919
02:27:37,169 --> 02:27:47,202
MATT: Constitution saving throw, essentially, is
what it is.

1920
02:27:47,202 --> 02:27:51,081
MARISHA: Constitution saving throw? Why?

1921
02:27:51,081 --> 02:27:54,826
MATT: This is to maintain your concentration as
you're falling.

1922
02:27:54,826 --> 02:27:56,125
MARISHA: 13.

1923
02:27:56,125 --> 02:28:01,533
MATT: Yeah. Unfortunately, due to the jostling,
you're unable to get the spell out in time.

1924
02:28:01,533 --> 02:28:05,873
Thorbir. Who else is jumping for the platform?

1925
02:28:05,873 --> 02:28:07,101
MARISHA: I go eagle.

1926
02:28:07,101 --> 02:28:13,019
MATT: Okay, you go eagle form. Keyleth catches
herself before plummeting inside and goes giant

1927
02:28:13,019 --> 02:28:20,587
eagle form, gliding past without an issue.
Tiberius is falling. I want you guys-- Tiberius,

1928
02:28:20,587 --> 02:28:24,991
Thorbir, Vax, and Kash-- to all make dexterity
saving throws.

1929
02:28:24,991 --> 02:28:29,860
LIAM: Tell me how I would go about doing this. As
I fall with the carpet, I want to try to pull up

1930
02:28:29,860 --> 02:28:33,651
on the carpet and land in the shit.

1931
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:39,505
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.

1932
02:28:39,505 --> 02:28:42,618
LIAM: 27.

1933
02:28:42,618 --> 02:28:49,642
MATT: 27. All right. What was your dex?

1934
02:28:49,642 --> 02:28:50,665
WIL: 14.

1935
02:28:50,665 --> 02:28:51,484
MATT: 14.

1936
02:28:51,484 --> 02:28:52,646
ORION: 17.

1937
02:28:52,646 --> 02:28:53,672
MATT: 17.

1938
02:28:53,672 --> 02:28:54,579
WILL: 12.

1939
02:28:54,579 --> 02:29:02,406
MATT: 12. So Thorbir and Tiberius make it onto
that small platform and barely catch yourself

1940
02:29:02,406 --> 02:29:11,337
before plummeting into the liquid. However,
Brother Kash, you (splash). And it's about

1941
02:29:11,337 --> 02:29:18,144
waist-deep from where you impact. (sizzling)
Immediately, you feel this horrible corrosive

1942
02:29:18,144 --> 02:29:24,327
burning sensation. You, grabbing the carpet, lift
and drift and come down into the section. This

1943
02:29:24,327 --> 02:29:31,725
section has eroded more, and you are about to go
up to your shoulders. Immediately, the two of you

1944
02:29:31,725 --> 02:29:34,967
suffer 18 points of acid damage.

1945
02:29:34,967 --> 02:29:37,712
LIAM: I'm wearing acid-resistant armor.

1946
02:29:37,712 --> 02:29:39,778
MATT: So you take nine points instead.

1947
02:29:39,778 --> 02:29:50,265
MARISHA: Can I fly and pick up Brother Kash, as an
eagle, and try and fly and drag him to the shore?

1948
02:29:50,265 --> 02:29:52,820
ORION: Don't worry about him. Is he a gnome?

1949
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:54,531
MARISHA: No, he's a human.

1950
02:29:54,531 --> 02:29:56,570
ORION: Get the carpet from him instead.

1951
02:29:56,570 --> 02:30:03,076
MATT: You're barely catching yourself. She's over
the other way right now. You, however, are

1952
02:30:03,076 --> 02:30:04,674
submerged in the liquid now.

1953
02:30:04,674 --> 02:30:05,713
LIAM: Am I under?

1954
02:30:05,713 --> 02:30:11,037
MATT: You're having to tread. You are now
underneath. Yep. You are completely submerged.

1955
02:30:11,037 --> 02:30:12,356
LIAM: Is the carpet with me?

1956
02:30:12,356 --> 02:30:13,293
MATT: Carpet is with you.

1957
02:30:13,293 --> 02:30:14,255
LIAM: Under the acid.

1958
02:30:14,255 --> 02:30:16,529
MATT: It is currently (sizzling) in the acid.

1959
02:30:16,529 --> 02:30:17,804
LIAM: Well, that did not work.

1960
02:30:17,804 --> 02:30:19,218
WILL: (laughs) No.

1961
02:30:19,218 --> 02:30:21,383
MARISHA: Wait, carpet's in the acid?

1962
02:30:21,383 --> 02:30:31,004
MATT: With him, yes. You guys are still on the
edge there. You reach over and grab him--

1963
02:30:31,004 --> 02:30:34,648
MARISHA: Grab the carpet. Grab the carpet with
you, Kash!

1964
02:30:34,648 --> 02:30:39,255
WILL: (grunts) He reaches out and grabs the
carpet, even though it's sizzling.

1965
02:30:39,255 --> 02:30:49,978
MATT: The carpet takes 16 points of acid damage.
As you're taking your turn to pull it out as opposed

1966
02:30:49,978 --> 02:30:58,599
to trying to escape from that point, you take
another 15 points of acid damage, until eventually

1967
02:30:58,642 --> 02:31:06,381
you're pulled out from the entire pool and carried
over to the other side and then dropped on the

1968
02:31:06,381 --> 02:31:14,283
other side, both of you guys pulling the carpet
out. The carpet itself, its color has dampened.

1969
02:31:14,283 --> 02:31:19,260
Portions of the corners of the carpet have
dissolved, and you can see the liquid on it is

1970
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:26,038
still eating away at the actual fibers of the
carpet. You're still submerged. You take another

1971
02:31:26,038 --> 02:31:34,215
18 points of acid damage, reduced to nine again.
Same as you took last time.

1972
02:31:34,215 --> 02:31:35,978
And what are you doing?

1973
02:31:35,978 --> 02:31:42,660
LIAM: Me? I'm trying to climb up onto the rock
that is right there that I didn't jump onto.

1974
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:44,902
MATT: Right here? There's only enough room for two
people.

1975
02:31:44,902 --> 02:31:46,096
LIAM: Who's on it now?

1976
02:31:46,096 --> 02:31:48,394
MATT: Currently, Tiberius and Thorbir.

1977
02:31:48,394 --> 02:31:50,091
LIAM: Well, I guess I'm swimming through acid,
then.

1978
02:31:50,091 --> 02:31:51,899
MATT: You can try and get on there, but you'd
probably push somebody else off.

1979
02:31:51,899 --> 02:31:54,100
LIAM: No, I'm just going to start wading towards
the other side.

1980
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:58,008
MATT: Okay. Athletics roll. It is a very thick,
gloopy liquid.

1981
02:31:58,008 --> 02:32:04,937
LIAM: That's all right because I rolled a 19, so
that is a total of 21.

1982
02:32:04,937 --> 02:32:08,321
MATT: 21. That'll be enough to get you just
towards the edge and you (grunts) pull yourself

1983
02:32:08,321 --> 02:32:17,419
out onto the side of the stonework, taking a final
13 points of acid damage, halved because of your

1984
02:32:17,419 --> 02:32:28,321
armor. You take seven. (pants) On the side, both
you and Kashaw are catching yourself, wiping it

1985
02:32:28,321 --> 02:32:33,366
off the parts of the flesh. You can see, there's
scarring on your skin from where the liquid began

1986
02:32:33,366 --> 02:32:39,580
to dissolve some of the flesh on the outer layers.
The carpet itself is still (sizzling). The edges

1987
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:42,229
of it are starting to burn away and dissolve.

1988
02:32:42,229 --> 02:32:44,209
MARISHA: Can you Prestidigitation that shit off?

1989
02:32:44,209 --> 02:32:47,197
MATT: He's across the way right now, currently on
the small platform with Thorbir. What are you guys

1990
02:32:47,197 --> 02:32:48,463
doing right now?

1991
02:32:48,463 --> 02:32:51,475
WIL: I want to look at the walls and see if
there's hand-holds or some other way that I can

1992
02:32:51,475 --> 02:32:57,509
try to go across the wall. You know, God of War
style.

1993
02:32:57,509 --> 02:33:03,286
MATT: Looking at it, there are parts of the walls
that have slowly become pockmarked from the

1994
02:33:03,286 --> 02:33:12,129
proximity of this caustic vitriol. They're few and
far between. You can attempt to do a leap,

1995
02:33:12,129 --> 02:33:16,887
parkour-style, but that would be a pretty hefty
feat of acrobatics to do so.

1996
02:33:16,887 --> 02:33:23,079
WIL: Well, as you may know, acrobatics is
something we heavy plate mail-wearing dwarves are

1997
02:33:23,079 --> 02:33:35,786
extraordinarily good at. Is she still an eagle?
Eagle! Hey, eagle!

1998
02:33:35,786 --> 02:33:37,074
MARISHA: (caws)

1999
02:33:37,074 --> 02:33:42,740
MATT: Swoop over.

2000
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:46,225
LIAM and MARISHA: (screech)

2001
02:33:46,225 --> 02:33:47,815
MATT: You grab Thorbir?

2002
02:33:47,815 --> 02:33:52,672
MARISHA: Actually, eagles sound like shit. They
use a raptor or something like that. Eagles don't

2003
02:33:52,672 --> 02:33:55,696
actually sound like that. Eagles are actually
like, (weak squawk).

2004
02:33:55,696 --> 02:34:01,498
MATT: They use an actual raptor sound they record
from the wild to dub the eagle.

2005
02:34:01,498 --> 02:34:03,687
WILL: They carry tiny little microphone things
right here.

2006
02:34:03,687 --> 02:34:06,092
MATT: Yeah, they have to construct eagle noises in
post.

2007
02:34:06,092 --> 02:34:08,205
WIL: It's all part of the great eagle conspiracy.

2008
02:34:08,205 --> 02:34:14,096
WILL: It's all Foley. Everything with an eagle.
Frank Welker is the sound of every eagle that's

2009
02:34:14,096 --> 02:34:15,390
ever been out there.

2010
02:34:15,390 --> 02:34:16,917
(laughter)

2011
02:34:16,917 --> 02:34:19,125
LIAM: I saw this great documentary about it on
YouTube.

2012
02:34:19,125 --> 02:34:21,518
MATT: Giraffes, foxes, eagles.

2013
02:34:21,518 --> 02:34:23,262
WILL: It's all Frank Welker.

2014
02:34:23,262 --> 02:34:27,488
WIL: Every other animal, Dee Bradley Baker.

2015
02:34:27,488 --> 02:34:28,654
ALL: Dee Bradley Baker!

2016
02:34:28,654 --> 02:34:31,590
(laughter)

2017
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:34,750
MATT: So are you grabbing Tiberius or Thorbir?

2018
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:42,990
MARISHA: Tiberius. (caws) Sorry! He's more
important. (caws)

2019
02:34:42,990 --> 02:34:45,745
ORION: I'll take out my Mending Wheel when I land,
and grab the carpet.

2020
02:34:45,745 --> 02:34:46,765
MARISHA: Fix that shit.

2021
02:34:46,765 --> 02:34:48,005
MATT: Okay.

2022
02:34:48,005 --> 02:34:50,505
MARISHA: And then I go back for Thorbir.

2023
02:34:50,505 --> 02:34:58,639
MATT: Okay. You take Thorbir and lift him back
over. Magic carpet has sustained fairly hefty

2024
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:04,829
damage and currently, the way you're reading it,
its enchantment is fading.

2025
02:35:04,829 --> 02:35:08,105
MARISHA: Hurry. Quick! Come on, Tiberius.

2026
02:35:08,105 --> 02:35:10,625
ORION: What, I'm fixing it! I'm using the Mending
Wheel.

2027
02:35:10,625 --> 02:35:13,839
MATT: Okay. You take the Mending Wheel, and you
set it up.

2028
02:35:13,839 --> 02:35:16,282
MARISHA: Maybe get the acid off it first.

2029
02:35:16,282 --> 02:35:19,795
ORION: I Prestidigitate it off, first. There.

2030
02:35:19,795 --> 02:35:25,765
WILL: How are you doing?

2031
02:35:25,765 --> 02:35:31,012
LIAM: I can walk. I can fight. I'm not as pretty.

2032
02:35:31,012 --> 02:35:32,111
WILL: Let's heal.

2033
02:35:32,111 --> 02:35:37,354
MARISHA: And remember, if everyone rolled 2d12,
you get that added to your maximum hit points,

2034
02:35:37,354 --> 02:35:39,318
from your meal.

2035
02:35:39,318 --> 02:35:45,294
WIL: Thorbir is pushing himself back as far away
from the acid as he can possibly get. He doesn't

2036
02:35:45,294 --> 02:35:47,463
care how ridiculous he looks.

2037
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:50,293
MATT: Okay. As you're keeping yourself at the
back, you can see it's all flowing in this

2038
02:35:50,293 --> 02:35:56,606
direction, slowly. It looks like there's a section
of the wall here that's somewhat open, and you can

2039
02:35:56,606 --> 02:36:02,177
see there's a pathway where it's flowing through
this direction, and it's coasting and flowing out

2040
02:36:02,177 --> 02:36:08,611
underneath the wall on this side. So you're
keeping a close eye on that. You've finished

2041
02:36:08,611 --> 02:36:14,493
assembling the Mending Wheel. You take the flying
carpet and set it on there. The wheel begins to

2042
02:36:14,493 --> 02:36:22,291
rotate, and as it does, the carpet curls up,
almost like heat to a hair. Curls up on its own

2043
02:36:22,291 --> 02:36:26,831
and begins to formulate this small cluster of
material. You can see where a lot of its vibrant

2044
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:33,903
color is gone and left with dark, charred, and
partially eaten-away cloth and cotton. I'm going

2045
02:36:33,903 --> 02:36:43,127
to ask you to make an arcana check to attempt to
use your concentration and knowledge of magic

2046
02:36:43,127 --> 02:36:45,512
enchantment to maintain it.

2047
02:36:45,512 --> 02:36:46,550
ORION: 18.

2048
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:55,509
MATT: 18 vs the damage dealt. Okay, as the Wheel
spins and spins, you can see as the color is

2049
02:36:55,509 --> 02:37:02,662
fading and fading and fading, the spark of
enchantment sputters and sputters, and then the

2050
02:37:02,662 --> 02:37:13,169
threads of the flying carpet begin to reattach and
reform, and areas where the damage to the carpet

2051
02:37:13,169 --> 02:37:19,451
begin to ravel back out into a fully functional
formed carpet. The Mending Wheel eventually comes

2052
02:37:19,451 --> 02:37:26,667
to a stop. The spokes of it collapse inward, and
the carpet unfurls. A solid, seemingly untouched

2053
02:37:26,667 --> 02:37:35,459
piece of material... A mundane carpet.

2054
02:37:35,459 --> 02:37:38,914
WIL: Well, that could have gone better.

2055
02:37:38,914 --> 02:37:41,513
WILL: It was a nice carpet.

2056
02:37:41,513 --> 02:37:45,512
ORION: It was a waste of fucking time. Let's press
on.

2057
02:37:45,512 --> 02:37:48,063
WILL: I'd like to Mass Cure Wounds first.

2058
02:37:48,063 --> 02:37:50,629
MATT: Okay.

2059
02:37:50,629 --> 02:37:52,010
MARISHA: Fuck.

2060
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:56,089
LIAM: Vex is going to kill us.

2061
02:37:56,089 --> 02:37:57,370
MARISHA: Yeah.

2062
02:37:57,370 --> 02:37:59,316
WILL: Who is that?

2063
02:37:59,316 --> 02:38:01,415
LIAM: My sister.

2064
02:38:01,415 --> 02:38:05,114
MARISHA: Oh god. We just heard them scream from
the other room. Oh my god.

2065
02:38:05,156 --> 02:38:09,492
LIAM: On a delay, they just saw it.

2066
02:38:09,492 --> 02:38:11,892
MARISHA: Yeah, they did. We're sorry!

2067
02:38:11,892 --> 02:38:18,113
LIAM: The other half of the party saw it die. 20
seconds after it happened, and we heard them

2068
02:38:18,113 --> 02:38:19,852
scream from out there.

2069
02:38:19,852 --> 02:38:22,066
MARISHA: Why are you being so poopy today,
Tiberius?

2070
02:38:22,066 --> 02:38:24,728
ORION: I'm cranky because I haven't slept, that's
why.

2071
02:38:24,728 --> 02:38:27,967
LIAM: Can we just take a moment for the carpet,
please? We've had a lot of good times

2072
02:38:27,967 --> 02:38:29,218
with that carpet.

2073
02:38:29,218 --> 02:38:30,573
ORION: Yeah. Too bad, right?

2074
02:38:30,573 --> 02:38:31,831
MARISHA: We've had a lot of good times.

2075
02:38:31,831 --> 02:38:33,290
WILL: You've had that carpet for a while?

2076
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:36,999
LIAM: We found Clarota on that carpet. Never mind.
Let's not talk about that. (sighs)

2077
02:38:36,999 --> 02:38:38,732
MARISHA: Fuck.

2078
02:38:38,732 --> 02:38:41,826
WIL: Thorbir has no attachment to this carpet. I'm
looking for exits.

2079
02:38:41,826 --> 02:38:43,982
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

2080
02:38:43,982 --> 02:38:45,266
ORION: Nor does Tiberius.

2081
02:38:45,266 --> 02:38:48,159
LIAM: Well, I do. And my sister's going to kill
me, specifically.

2082
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:49,971
MARISHA: Vex is going to be so angry.

2083
02:38:49,971 --> 02:38:51,971
ORION: This is a death march.

2084
02:38:51,971 --> 02:38:53,496
WIL: 15.

2085
02:38:53,496 --> 02:38:56,225
MARISHA: I give Vax a hug.

2086
02:38:56,225 --> 02:38:58,421
WILL: Are we curing the wounds, too?

2087
02:38:58,421 --> 02:39:03,394
MATT: Yes. What's the total amount of cure? Mass
Cure Wounds?

2088
02:39:03,394 --> 02:39:08,794
WILL: I want to cast on everybody, if I can.

2089
02:39:08,794 --> 02:39:12,541
MATT: I would say Mass Cure Wounds, as a tactical
standpoint, is a better thing to save for combat

2090
02:39:12,692 --> 02:39:14,899
because it's a thing you can do one round, and you
can heal everybody.

2091
02:39:14,899 --> 02:39:15,913
WILL: Oh, okay.

2092
02:39:15,913 --> 02:39:20,363
MATT: So you'd more want to spend your level-1
spells and cure people as you go.

2093
02:39:20,363 --> 02:39:23,021
WILL: Yeah, I think I'd like to do that. I'd like
to at least cure myself with

2094
02:39:23,021 --> 02:39:24,204
my level-1 cure, then.

2095
02:39:24,204 --> 02:39:33,212
MATT: Okay, go for it. Looking at this area, the
wall is solid stone. There is no apparent exit.

2096
02:39:33,212 --> 02:39:39,997
You take a while and inspect the wall, but it just
seems to be solid walls. Either the exit may have

2097
02:39:39,997 --> 02:39:43,714
been part of the collapsed wall, or there is no
exit to this room.

2098
02:39:43,714 --> 02:39:47,015
WILL: Equal to 1d8 plus my spellcasting ability.

2099
02:39:47,015 --> 02:39:50,395
WIL: I can't seem to find a way out of here.

2100
02:39:50,534 --> 02:39:53,109
LIAM: (groans) Sorry.

2101
02:39:53,109 --> 02:40:01,007
WIL: Maybe your skills could be useful. There's
time to mourn the dead. And the carpet.

2102
02:40:01,007 --> 02:40:02,792
MARISHA: It's like a member of our family, man.

2103
02:40:02,792 --> 02:40:04,243
LIAM: Got an 18 on perception.

2104
02:40:04,243 --> 02:40:05,633
MATT: 18 on perception.

2105
02:40:05,633 --> 02:40:08,106
LIAM: So we're at a dead end on the other side of
this shit?

2106
02:40:08,106 --> 02:40:09,731
WIL: I certainly hope not.

2107
02:40:09,731 --> 02:40:15,792
MATT: Looking around the wall, you can see there's
a section where you both look over on the far end

2108
02:40:15,836 --> 02:40:24,416
in the corner, and there is a small panel of stone
that seems to have a slight mismatch in the

2109
02:40:24,416 --> 02:40:30,825
texture of the rest of the wall. As you both
look at the wall, you see it and you take that cue

2110
02:40:30,825 --> 02:40:37,839
and walk up and shove the plate at the side and it
(stone scraping) glides to the side, slightly. And

2111
02:40:37,839 --> 02:40:43,904
there is a small three foot by three foot entryway
that exits this side of the room.

2112
02:40:43,904 --> 02:40:50,279
MARISHA: We almost lost the carpet that one time,
too, and we found it.

2113
02:40:50,279 --> 02:40:51,903
WILL: She's still talking about the carpet.

2114
02:40:51,903 --> 02:40:52,964
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

2115
02:40:52,964 --> 02:40:55,134
WILL: I was literally just swimming in acid.

2116
02:40:55,134 --> 02:40:57,898
LIAM: Look, Tiberius, it has sentimental value.
We'll put it in Greyskull Keep.

2117
02:40:57,898 --> 02:40:59,504
Just put it in the bag.

2118
02:40:59,504 --> 02:41:03,638
MARISHA: We can hang it up like a tapestry. That
would be nice.

2119
02:41:03,638 --> 02:41:06,360
ORION: No, we can make it fly again.

2120
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:10,391
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Thorbir has disappeared through a small pathway

2121
02:41:10,391 --> 02:41:12,579
that he and Vax both found.

2122
02:41:12,579 --> 02:41:15,440
LIAM: Folks, we're moving! And I follow him.

2123
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:21,671
MATT: You step through a 15-foot corridor that
immediately opens into another room that has a

2124
02:41:21,671 --> 02:41:32,855
small lower foyer area and a slight step up into a
large contained room. This room is not as dark as

2125
02:41:32,855 --> 02:41:37,532
everything else you've gone through, as far as
light source. This room has a very faint series of

2126
02:41:37,532 --> 02:41:43,706
braziers along the walls. They have almost a
slight ember torchlight lighting the vicinity.

2127
02:41:43,706 --> 02:41:51,354
Looking inside, you can immediately see what looks
to be another small stream of that same acidic

2128
02:41:51,354 --> 02:41:57,619
vitriol that is slowly pouring across the floor,
and this appears to be the source that you saw

2129
02:41:57,619 --> 02:42:01,465
before that has been trickling through and is
eating into the side of the wall immediately to your

2130
02:42:01,537 --> 02:42:06,970
left. Along the walls, there are sets of armor of
varying size. They're set up as ornamental pieces.

2131
02:42:06,970 --> 02:42:13,344
In the center of the room, there is a
ten-foot-tall stone statue that stands before you.

2132
02:42:13,344 --> 02:42:23,160
Humanoid, male, with slicked long hair that goes
to about mid-back. You see fine robes that look

2133
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:30,244
beautifully carved out of this dark gray
stone. The face is very chiseled and handsome, but

2134
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:36,435
at the top of the forehead, you see these two
hooked horns that continue upward. There is not

2135
02:42:36,435 --> 02:42:43,364
two legs, but one singular cloven hoof at the
bottom of its torso as it stands. And you can see,

2136
02:42:43,364 --> 02:42:49,450
from the eyes, the source of the green acidic
liquid that drips down like tears, pools on the

2137
02:42:49,450 --> 02:42:52,038
ground, and spills out of the room.

2138
02:42:52,038 --> 02:42:59,199
WILL: Well, that's not good.

2139
02:42:59,199 --> 02:43:11,735
MARISHA: Kashaw, does this mean anything to you?

2140
02:43:11,735 --> 02:43:13,787
MATT: You guys are entering after?

2141
02:43:13,787 --> 02:43:14,991
WILL: Yes.

2142
02:43:14,991 --> 02:43:17,979
WIL: I step away from the acid to my left.

2143
02:43:17,979 --> 02:43:24,950
WILL: Can I do a religion check on the statue?

2144
02:43:24,950 --> 02:43:29,012
MATT: You may, very much so.

2145
02:43:29,012 --> 02:43:36,372
WILL: 18.

2146
02:43:36,372 --> 02:43:46,947
MATT: 18. You recognize, very clearly from your
religious studies and your travels, this is

2147
02:43:46,947 --> 02:43:53,229
Dispater, who is one of the archdevils of the
second layer of Hell. Also known as the Iron Duke,

2148
02:43:53,229 --> 02:43:56,873
and is considered a master of politics and
manipulation.

2149
02:43:56,873 --> 02:44:00,212
WILL: The Iron Duke.

2150
02:44:00,212 --> 02:44:04,392
LIAM: I'm going stealth now.

2151
02:44:04,392 --> 02:44:05,908
MATT: Roll stealth.

2152
02:44:05,908 --> 02:44:12,388
MARISHA: Master of politicians and deception.

2153
02:44:12,388 --> 02:44:13,865
MATT: Politics and deception.

2154
02:44:13,865 --> 02:44:15,768
ORION: I cast Greater Invisibility.

2155
02:44:15,768 --> 02:44:35,201
MATT: All righty. I will say, it's at this point
that as you all assembled, you hear a voice echo

2156
02:44:35,201 --> 02:44:51,525
through the room. It starts off as this low
simmering growl. (growls) "I ask you all this

2157
02:44:51,525 --> 02:45:03,771
"question: Why do you hunt Hotis? Why do you come
seeking me dead so fervently that you would

2158
02:45:03,771 --> 02:45:13,533
"continue past such terrible losses and dangers?"
Looking around the room, you see no source of the

2159
02:45:13,533 --> 02:45:17,633
voice that seems to be either omnipresent or loud
enough that the echoing of the walls doesn't give

2160
02:45:17,633 --> 02:45:20,110
away any location.

2161
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:26,435
ORION: Our hand is forced. We are bound by
contract. I do not personally wish to be here.

2162
02:45:26,435 --> 02:45:36,988
MATT: "What if I could tell you this contract you
are bound to, there are ways of getting around

2163
02:45:36,988 --> 02:45:38,570
"such magics?"

2164
02:45:38,570 --> 02:45:43,083
WIL: Why should we trust someone who chooses not
to reveal itself?

2165
02:45:43,083 --> 02:45:48,642
MATT: "Why should you trust someone that with very
little reason sent you to your death beneath a prison

2166
02:45:48,796 --> 02:45:50,956
"cell to die a pit of acid?"

2167
02:45:50,956 --> 02:45:52,548
WILL: We're not dead yet.

2168
02:45:52,548 --> 02:45:53,914
MATT: "Yet."

2169
02:45:53,914 --> 02:45:58,256
ORION: What is this offer that you speak of?

2170
02:45:58,256 --> 02:46:09,077
MATT: "You could try and kill me, and you may very
well destroy me, but I'll be back. Or we could

2171
02:46:09,077 --> 02:46:15,618
"choose to make a deal. Perhaps a separate
contract. Equally binding, but nowhere near as

2172
02:46:15,618 --> 02:46:25,200
"dangerous as this one. And I would say as part of
this deal, perhaps we could do some business down

2173
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:30,226
"the road. You've already walked into my place of
business and disturbed my customers and briefly

2174
02:46:30,267 --> 02:46:37,068
"nearly ended my business venture for the time
being. This is a very angering thing for one who

2175
02:46:37,068 --> 02:46:45,389
"spends a very long time building these ventures.
And I have plans. I have plots. Looking at the

2176
02:46:45,389 --> 02:46:51,718
"both of you, I can see that perhaps you are not
bound by the moralities that such silly folks in

2177
02:46:51,718 --> 02:46:55,755
"Vasselheim seem to cling to. Am I incorrect?"

2178
02:46:55,755 --> 02:47:11,320
MARISHA: Why don't you come out and speak to us
face to face, Hosier? Or Hosien?

2179
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:13,832
MATT: "Hotis."

2180
02:47:13,832 --> 02:47:16,373
MARISHA: Ah, so your real name is Hotis.

2181
02:47:16,373 --> 02:47:20,496
ORION: If that is your real name.

2182
02:47:20,496 --> 02:47:30,798
MATT: (chuckles) "It is the name you know. That is
all that is required. But I think you know as well

2183
02:47:30,798 --> 02:47:41,433
"as I do. For my safety, I will remain unseen, just
as your friend has. Now, will you let me leave? We

2184
02:47:41,433 --> 02:47:46,533
"can have this conversation in the comfort of my
own room. In fact, we can throw a small party. I

2185
02:47:46,533 --> 02:47:54,002
"have the means to do so. You've already proven
quite skilled at combat, and I would hate to think

2186
02:47:54,002 --> 02:47:57,014
"you would throw away an opportunity for what
paltry sum they're offering you

2187
02:47:57,054 --> 02:47:59,641
"for a temporary victory."

2188
02:47:59,641 --> 02:48:02,409
WIL: Thorbir steps back and blocks the door.

2189
02:48:02,409 --> 02:48:04,352
MATT: Okay.

2190
02:48:04,352 --> 02:48:07,063
WILL: Does anybody trust this guy?

2191
02:48:07,063 --> 02:48:08,582
WIL: No deal.

2192
02:48:08,582 --> 02:48:10,238
ORION: I don't think it's a bad idea.

2193
02:48:10,238 --> 02:48:13,416
MARISHA: He serves the god of politics and
deception.

2194
02:48:13,482 --> 02:48:14,889
WILL: Does he?

2195
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:16,504
MARISHA: I'm assuming.

2196
02:48:16,504 --> 02:48:18,317
ORION: That same guy?

2197
02:48:18,317 --> 02:48:21,991
MARISHA: Well, I'm assuming if he's got the statue
of--

2198
02:48:22,035 --> 02:48:25,688
WILL: The Iron Duke himself.

2199
02:48:25,688 --> 02:48:36,578
WIL: I'd like to make an insight check and see if
I can get a sense of how confident he feels.

2200
02:48:36,637 --> 02:48:50,224
20, motherfuckers!

2201
02:48:50,224 --> 02:48:53,744
I want to know everything about
him. I want to know his parents' name. I want to

2202
02:48:53,744 --> 02:48:57,686
know his social security number. I want to know
what his bank account balance is. And I want to

2203
02:48:57,686 --> 02:48:59,907
know his Ashley Madison password.

2204
02:48:59,950 --> 02:49:03,430
(laughter)

2205
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:06,614
LIAM: I want him dead. I want his house burned to
the ground.

2206
02:49:06,614 --> 02:49:15,589
MATT: As you're all taking in this still and very
creepy omnipresence of this Hotis character, you,

2207
02:49:15,589 --> 02:49:20,969
in hearing the voice, it is a very trained voice.
This is an individual that has spent the entirety

2208
02:49:20,969 --> 02:49:26,783
of their life manipulating and toying with the
emotions, minds, greed, and goals of others to get

2209
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:34,302
its desires itself, both self-preservation and
progressive expansion of its own territory. You

2210
02:49:34,302 --> 02:49:42,798
can tell in its voice, there is a hint of fear and
a very heavy coating of words that are very well

2211
02:49:42,798 --> 02:49:49,563
practiced and silver-tongued. But you gather that
there is very little intent to follow through on

2212
02:49:49,563 --> 02:49:53,332
its side of the bargain, and everything is
designed as misdirection to send whatever it's

2213
02:49:53,332 --> 02:49:56,250
made a deal with to its eventual doom.

2214
02:49:56,250 --> 02:50:03,397
WIL: It dies in this room. Do you hear me? You die
in this room.

2215
02:50:03,397 --> 02:50:08,033
MATT: "That is unfortunate." I would like all of
you to make a perception check right now.

2216
02:50:08,033 --> 02:50:10,253
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2217
02:50:10,253 --> 02:50:17,477
WIL: 13 total.

2218
02:50:17,477 --> 02:50:18,863
MARISHA: Not bad. 23.

2219
02:50:18,863 --> 02:50:19,804
LIAM: 22.

2220
02:50:19,804 --> 02:50:20,862
WILL: 19.

2221
02:50:20,862 --> 02:50:21,829
MARISHA: 23.

2222
02:50:21,829 --> 02:50:22,870
ORION: Five.

2223
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:29,557
MATT: Okay. Both Keyleth and Vax, looking around
the room, there is a little hint of movement, and

2224
02:50:29,557 --> 02:50:34,532
you look over at the statue itself. There's a
little glimmer of something shift. You see what

2225
02:50:34,532 --> 02:50:41,164
appears to be this amulet or necklace of some kind
that was resting around the statue. It vanishes.

2226
02:50:41,164 --> 02:50:50,697
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch. I want to cast Faerie
Fire in that direction, right where I see the

2227
02:50:50,697 --> 02:50:51,625
glimmer.

2228
02:50:51,625 --> 02:50:54,904
MATT: Okay. First off, everyone roll initiative.

2229
02:50:54,904 --> 02:51:00,595
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2230
02:51:00,595 --> 02:51:08,068
WIL: Just in case anyone was worried. If you
thought perhaps we'd slipped into some sort of odd

2231
02:51:08,068 --> 02:51:17,009
parallel universe where I was competent or in any
way able to do anything. Just to let you know that

2232
02:51:17,009 --> 02:51:21,200
we are, in fact, in the same reality, I did just
roll another one.

2233
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:24,514
WILL: Good god.

2234
02:51:24,514 --> 02:51:27,785
LIAM: I can fly!

2235
02:51:27,785 --> 02:51:32,302
MATT: Okay.

2236
02:51:32,302 --> 02:51:35,200
ORION: Well done.

2237
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:40,518
WILL: You got us so much insight, though.

2238
02:51:40,518 --> 02:51:48,335
WIL: Thorbir is just slow because he is processing
and dealing with the rage and anger and the

2239
02:51:48,335 --> 02:51:56,019
memories of betrayal that he has experienced,
having heard these sounds come from the mouths of

2240
02:51:56,019 --> 02:51:57,851
others before.

2241
02:51:57,851 --> 02:52:04,551
MATT: And with that, 20 or higher? 15 to 20?

2242
02:52:04,551 --> 02:52:05,979
LIAM: 19.

2243
02:52:05,979 --> 02:52:10,435
MATT: 19. All right. 15 to ten?

2244
02:52:10,435 --> 02:52:11,386
WILL: 14.

2245
02:52:11,386 --> 02:52:12,371
MARISHA: 13.

2246
02:52:12,371 --> 02:52:13,465
ORION: 12.

2247
02:52:13,465 --> 02:52:20,503
MATT: (laughs) Look at that. All right, so 14 was
Kash?

2248
02:52:20,503 --> 02:52:22,075
WILL: Yes, sir.

2249
02:52:22,075 --> 02:52:25,689
MATT: 13 was?

2250
02:52:25,689 --> 02:52:27,215
MARISHA: Me.

2251
02:52:27,215 --> 02:52:42,174
MATT: Keyleth. And then Tiberius. All righty. (laughs) All
right. Top of the round. You hear some footsteps.

2252
02:52:42,219 --> 02:53:00,802
There is a brief shimmering, and you see across
the room, a form appear in the far corner. You see

2253
02:53:00,802 --> 02:53:07,129
immediately this humanoid figure appear. Long,
reddish robes, humanoid body, but the head itself

2254
02:53:07,129 --> 02:53:15,496
is this dark gray feline tiger-like entity. This long,
pronounced feline snout. Big fangs dripping from

2255
02:53:15,536 --> 02:53:21,180
it, long whiskers, a sadistic grin on its face.
The amulet that was once adorning the statue now

2256
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:25,265
around its neck. Where its hands are, you can see
the hands are actually backwards and upturned in

2257
02:53:25,265 --> 02:53:32,070
these nasty-looking claws. It continues and
releases its hands in some sort of arcane form.

2258
02:53:32,070 --> 02:53:33,263
ORION: Rakshasa.

2259
02:53:33,263 --> 02:53:34,663
MARISHA: Rakshasa.

2260
02:53:34,663 --> 02:53:39,718
MATT: Rakshasa.

2261
02:53:39,874 --> 02:53:41,013
WILL: A rakshasa!

2262
02:53:41,142 --> 02:53:43,620
(laughter)

2263
02:53:43,663 --> 02:53:46,017
MATT: And with that, Tiberius.

2264
02:53:46,177 --> 02:53:48,328
MARISHA: So I don't get Faerie Fire off on him
first?

2265
02:53:48,328 --> 02:53:55,705
MATT: No, that's going to be on your turn there.
That's what the initiative roll was for. I need

2266
02:53:55,705 --> 02:53:58,162
you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

2267
02:53:58,162 --> 02:53:59,719
ORION: Hold on, what is he doing? Is he casting a
spell?

2268
02:53:59,719 --> 02:54:01,193
MATT: He is, currently, yes.

2269
02:54:01,193 --> 02:54:02,620
ORION: 4th-level Counterspell.

2270
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:05,033
MATT: 4th-level Counterspell.

2271
02:54:05,033 --> 02:54:08,475
MARISHA: You have advantage on wisdom saving
throws. Just throwing it out there.

2272
02:54:08,475 --> 02:54:10,710
MATT: So you do that.

2273
02:54:10,710 --> 02:54:15,384
ORION: No. It shall not do nothing on my watch.

2274
02:54:15,384 --> 02:54:19,688
LIAM: To quote the bard. Scanlan.

2275
02:54:19,781 --> 02:54:23,118
MARISHA: I love that you felt like you had to
clarify.

2276
02:54:23,118 --> 02:54:30,987
MATT: So he goes and finishes a Charm Person spell
towards you. You release that with your ring and

2277
02:54:30,987 --> 02:54:35,797
the spell dissipates from his grasp. (growls) It
growls under its breath.

2278
02:54:35,797 --> 02:54:37,914
ORION: How can he see me, by the way? I'm
invisible, still.

2279
02:54:37,914 --> 02:54:39,339
MATT: He can see you.

2280
02:54:39,339 --> 02:54:40,605
ORION: Bastard!

2281
02:54:40,605 --> 02:54:41,749
MARISHA: He's smart.

2282
02:54:41,749 --> 02:54:51,700
MATT: Yeah. Even though you're invisible, he
looked right at you and cast the spell. You gather

2283
02:54:51,700 --> 02:54:58,361
that there's something about him that can see
through invisibility. With that, he's going to

2284
02:54:58,361 --> 02:55:07,317
move in that direction. And at the end of that,
that brings us to Vax.

2285
02:55:07,317 --> 02:55:14,703
LIAM: All right. Well, I earlier rolled a 32 on
stealth, but I don't know if that means shit right

2286
02:55:14,703 --> 02:55:19,514
now, but I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and moving
along the wall.

2287
02:55:19,514 --> 02:55:23,158
MATT: Along the wall here?

2288
02:55:23,158 --> 02:55:29,794
LIAM: No. I'm going to stay put. I'm going to
attack him. I'm going to throw-- dagger, dagger,

2289
02:55:29,794 --> 02:55:34,189
dagger-- through the air. (flying blades) From the
shadows. I have no idea. He might be able to see

2290
02:55:34,189 --> 02:55:35,628
me like the Predator.

2291
02:55:35,628 --> 02:55:37,090
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2292
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:44,195
LIAM: He already moved, right? So I don't get
advantage for Assassinate, but we'll see if I get

2293
02:55:44,195 --> 02:55:55,564
sneak attack damage. That's a three, so that's
shit. That's a nine-- 15.

2294
02:55:55,564 --> 02:55:57,183
MATT: 15? Misses.

2295
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:59,169
MARISHA: Dagger, dagger, dagger.

2296
02:55:59,169 --> 02:56:03,193
LIAM: That is 21.

2297
02:56:03,193 --> 02:56:04,456
MATT: 21 does hit.

2298
02:56:04,456 --> 02:56:07,342
LIAM: That was the Dagger of Life-Stealing.

2299
02:56:07,342 --> 02:56:12,164
MATT: All right, so first one spins off. Second
one, he ducks out of the way. The third one hits

2300
02:56:12,164 --> 02:56:14,105
him in the side of the shoulder.

2301
02:56:14,105 --> 02:56:16,862
LIAM: Now you tell me: I was hidden in the shadows
and rolled a 32. Does that matter with him?

2302
02:56:16,862 --> 02:56:18,992
MATT: Right, you can roll sneak attack damage.

2303
02:56:18,992 --> 02:56:34,512
LIAM: Yeah! Okay. (counts quietly) 22. Yeah, 22.

2304
02:56:34,512 --> 02:56:44,406
MATT: 22 damage? All right. It smacks into him. It
hits him. The impact, though, seems to almost be

2305
02:56:44,406 --> 02:56:49,617
partially absorbed or shrugged off. You're not
entirely certain. It feels like it should have hit

2306
02:56:49,617 --> 02:56:59,512
harder, but nevertheless, he took damage. All
righty. Are you going to stay put?

2307
02:56:59,512 --> 02:57:07,452
LIAM: I'm going to move through the group,
directly counter to him, behind the statue.

2308
02:57:07,452 --> 02:57:15,488
MATT: All righty. That'll end your turn. Now Kash,
you are going. At the same time, one of the nearby

2309
02:57:15,488 --> 02:57:23,388
larger pieces of armor comes to life and steps
forward. You can now see, there is a large

2310
02:57:23,388 --> 02:57:27,160
humanoid form that is built out of a giant
breastplate with the shoulder pauldrons, a helmet,

2311
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:34,150
and these giant stone-like fists and feet that
come lunging forward. Portions of its body are

2312
02:57:34,150 --> 02:57:41,941
made of a thick leather or wood structure. As it
comes bursting forward. (impact noise)

2313
02:57:41,941 --> 02:57:45,544
MARISHA: What's that?

2314
02:57:45,544 --> 02:57:55,092
MATT: You can hope to make a check on your turn.
Brother Kash, what are you doing?

2315
02:57:55,092 --> 02:58:03,042
WILL: Let's see how tough this guy is. Let me cast
a quick Sacred Flame-- well, first I want to move

2316
02:58:03,042 --> 02:58:04,314
into the room.

2317
02:58:04,314 --> 02:58:07,145
MATT: Okay, move there? Further in?

2318
02:58:07,145 --> 02:58:11,825
WILL: Yeah. I want to get it to where eventually
we're going to try to get a semicircle around him.

2319
02:58:11,825 --> 02:58:17,644
So closer to that area around there to get a
crescent going.

2320
02:58:17,644 --> 02:58:20,213
MATT: Okay, cool. This is about as far as you can
get on this turn.

2321
02:58:20,367 --> 02:58:25,695
WILL: Okay. Perfect. And then let's try a quick
Sacred Flame on him.

2322
02:58:25,695 --> 02:58:26,850
MATT: Against which guy?

2323
02:58:26,850 --> 02:58:28,535
WILL: Against the new entity.

2324
02:58:28,535 --> 02:58:29,900
MATT: All right, go for it.

2325
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:32,051
WILL: That's you, right?

2326
02:58:32,051 --> 02:58:39,827
MATT: Yeah. He gets a saving throw. All right, it
does make its saving throw. I just rolled a

2327
02:58:39,827 --> 02:58:45,567
natural 19. So as you release the Sacred Flame, it
seems to almost ricochet off. There's some sort of

2328
02:58:45,567 --> 02:58:56,251
magical essence about this creature's
construction. That ends your turn. This entity

2329
02:58:56,251 --> 02:59:09,637
here is going to step forward, and you can see it
brings its fist up for a second. There's a small

2330
02:59:09,637 --> 02:59:15,786
gem that's embedded in one of the stone fists, and
you can see it's pulsing with stored energy. It

2331
02:59:15,786 --> 02:59:21,185
puts the fist forward as the rakshasa in the
background as Hotis instructs it and points

2332
02:59:21,185 --> 02:59:26,403
forward towards you guys. It puts the fist
forward. The gem glows red and then releases a

2333
02:59:26,403 --> 02:59:29,082
very familiar-looking bead of red energy.

2334
02:59:29,082 --> 02:59:32,371
ORION: Is that a spell? Do I recognize that as a
spell being cast?

2335
02:59:32,371 --> 02:59:33,583
MATT: It is a spell.

2336
02:59:33,583 --> 02:59:35,124
ORION: Counterspell!

2337
02:59:35,124 --> 02:59:37,217
MATT: You've already used your reaction this
turn.

2338
02:59:37,217 --> 02:59:38,588
ORION: Damn it!

2339
02:59:38,588 --> 02:59:44,768
MATT: (laughs) You guys look over and see this as
the red beam comes and hits the back wall and

2340
02:59:44,768 --> 02:59:49,804
(explosion) detonates in a large Fireball blast
that encapsulates the entire

2341
02:59:49,804 --> 02:59:51,043
opposite side of the room.

2342
02:59:51,043 --> 02:59:52,957
LIAM: I'm using Evasion. I'm going to hit the
ground and roll.

2343
02:59:52,957 --> 02:59:56,043
MATT: Okay. That would be a dexterity saving throw
for all of you.

2344
02:59:56,043 --> 03:00:03,499
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah! Natural 19. 19.

2345
03:00:03,499 --> 03:00:09,304
WILL: Seven.

2346
03:00:09,304 --> 03:00:11,089
MATT: Seven? (laughs) Fail.

2347
03:00:11,089 --> 03:00:12,227
ORION: 19.

2348
03:00:12,227 --> 03:00:13,073
MATT: 19.

2349
03:00:13,073 --> 03:00:13,775
MARISHA: 24.

2350
03:00:13,775 --> 03:00:14,525
MATT: 24.

2351
03:00:14,525 --> 03:00:19,898
WIL: Well, I mean, I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, oh, clearly I haven't touched my

2352
03:00:19,948 --> 03:00:27,837
die because the last time I rolled my die, it had
a one on it. But in fact, I did roll another one.

2353
03:00:27,837 --> 03:00:36,978
MATT: I feel like we're this close to starting the
apocalypse. With each one that you roll--

2354
03:00:36,978 --> 03:00:40,439
WILL: One small black hole is getting a little bit
bigger in the universe?

2355
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:44,413
MATT: Yeah. Somewhere deep beneath the Vatican,
there's some monk who's running around screaming

2356
03:00:44,413 --> 03:00:52,124
as their artifacts are cracking in half. That's
amazing. All right. Well, that is 33 points of

2357
03:00:52,124 --> 03:00:59,725
damage to Thorbir and to Brother Kash. Half of
that to both of you guys.

2358
03:00:59,725 --> 03:01:01,338
MARISHA: How much was the first one?

2359
03:01:01,338 --> 03:01:04,237
MATT: It was 33. So half of that would put you at
16.

2360
03:01:04,237 --> 03:01:06,148
LIAM: Well, what did we have to hit? I rolled a
16.

2361
03:01:06,148 --> 03:01:08,746
MATT: You rolled a 16? It would be a 16.

2362
03:01:08,746 --> 03:01:10,115
LIAM: So I made it?

2363
03:01:10,115 --> 03:01:11,825
MATT: So you made it. You take no damage.

2364
03:01:11,825 --> 03:01:14,245
LIAM: Nothing. I hit the ground and roll. Stop,
drop, and roll, people! Stop, drop, and roll.

2365
03:01:14,245 --> 03:01:17,287
WIL: Little busy right now, on fire.

2366
03:01:17,287 --> 03:01:30,018
MATT: (laughs) All right, so. That is the
creature's turn. It finishes its spell, pulls

2367
03:01:30,018 --> 03:01:33,971
back. However, the gem goes to a dull, dark state.
No more stored magical energy.

2368
03:01:33,971 --> 03:01:36,336
Kash, what are you doing?

2369
03:01:36,336 --> 03:01:43,236
WILL: I've got to heal myself, unfortunately,
because I'm getting down there. So I'm going to

2370
03:01:43,236 --> 03:01:46,432
Cure Wounds.

2371
03:01:46,432 --> 03:01:50,432
MATT: Okay. At what level? You can cast it at a
higher level.

2372
03:01:50,432 --> 03:01:57,853
WILL: I know. I'm not sure I want to, yet. You
know what? I am. I'm going to Mass Cure Wounds

2373
03:01:57,853 --> 03:01:59,749
right now, just because I'm so low.

2374
03:01:59,749 --> 03:02:00,614
MATT: Okay.

2375
03:02:00,614 --> 03:02:01,886
WILL: So it's level 5.

2376
03:02:01,886 --> 03:02:03,631
MATT: Okay, so Mass Cure Wounds.

2377
03:02:03,631 --> 03:02:14,832
WIL: Did you do this to them? Did you come to
watch them die when they were playing?

2378
03:02:14,832 --> 03:02:17,022
MATT: So that is 3d8 plus five.

2379
03:02:17,022 --> 03:02:21,305
WILL: 3d8 plus five. Where are the d8s?

2380
03:02:21,305 --> 03:02:23,936
MATT: Plus, you get a healing bonus, as you are a
healing cleric, as well.

2381
03:02:23,936 --> 03:02:25,211
Look under your special abilities.

2382
03:02:25,211 --> 03:02:27,315
MARISHA: Yeah, you get plus two to all your
healing spells.

2383
03:02:27,315 --> 03:02:28,562
WILL: So 3d8.

2384
03:02:28,562 --> 03:02:31,424
MARISHA: Nice!

2385
03:02:31,424 --> 03:02:38,097
WILL: Nice, okay. That's good. So 17 plus five,
you said? So that's 23.

2386
03:02:38,097 --> 03:02:39,434
MARISHA: Plus two.

2387
03:02:39,434 --> 03:02:40,392
WILL: Plus two.

2388
03:02:40,392 --> 03:02:42,511
MATT: Plus seven to each, since it's plus your
spell level, too.

2389
03:02:42,511 --> 03:02:45,034
So it's plus seven on top of that.

2390
03:02:45,034 --> 03:02:52,773
WILL: Plus seven? Okay, now you've confused me.
Now there's all these numbers. 17 plus two, so

2391
03:02:52,773 --> 03:02:54,295
that's 19. Plus five.

2392
03:02:54,295 --> 03:02:55,396
MATT: Yes.

2393
03:02:55,396 --> 03:03:00,981
WILL: Okay. So it's 24. Okay. So everybody gets
24, is that right?

2394
03:03:00,981 --> 03:03:02,638
MATT: 24 hit points.

2395
03:03:02,638 --> 03:03:08,496
MARISHA: Back up to full. And remember, you get
plus 2d12 to your max hit points because we ate

2396
03:03:08,496 --> 03:03:11,843
good food. Nothing beats a home-cooked meal.

2397
03:03:11,843 --> 03:03:19,927
MATT: Did everyone keep track of that? All righty.
So Kash, that's your move and that's your spell.

2398
03:03:19,927 --> 03:03:22,250
That's your turn. You're done. Keyleth, you're
up.

2399
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:25,604
MARISHA: Faerie Fire, right on the rakshasa.

2400
03:03:25,604 --> 03:03:27,215
MATT: All righty.

2401
03:03:27,215 --> 03:03:28,601
WILL: Rakshasa!

2402
03:03:28,601 --> 03:03:34,144
MATT: You cast Faerie Fire, and you can see the
energy coalesce and dissipate.

2403
03:03:34,144 --> 03:03:35,688
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

2404
03:03:35,688 --> 03:03:38,603
MATT: The rakshasa: unaffected entirely by the
spell.

2405
03:03:38,603 --> 03:03:42,180
ORION: None of our magical works against-- you
know what I'm going to say! I'm speaking Draconic

2406
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:43,572
again, sorry.

2407
03:03:43,572 --> 03:03:45,889
(laughter)

2408
03:03:45,889 --> 03:03:53,522
MARISHA: I look at him, and I go, um? And now I'm
going Minxie.

2409
03:03:53,522 --> 03:03:54,836
MATT: Okay.

2410
03:03:54,836 --> 03:03:57,883
MARISHA: Going Minxie!

2411
03:03:57,883 --> 03:04:00,523
LIAM: Tiger on tiger?!

2412
03:04:00,523 --> 03:04:02,212
MARISHA: Tiger on tiger!

2413
03:04:02,212 --> 03:04:04,112
WILL: There's a website for that.

2414
03:04:04,112 --> 03:04:07,505
WIL: I saw the show at the Bellagio. It's
amazing.

2415
03:04:07,505 --> 03:04:15,538
MATT: You guys watch as Keyleth now angrily morphs
into this large, white saber-toothed tiger that

2416
03:04:15,538 --> 03:04:19,287
roars on the ground where she once was. You can
move, still, if you wish.

2417
03:04:19,287 --> 03:04:27,348
MARISHA: I'm going for rakshasa, so I'm going to
head this way.

2418
03:04:27,348 --> 03:04:29,486
MATT: You have a speed of 40, I think?

2419
03:04:29,486 --> 03:04:35,671
MARISHA: Speed is 40.

2420
03:04:35,671 --> 03:04:42,889
MATT: So you can get right up next to it. Yep. So
you run around the side of the giant statue and

2421
03:04:42,889 --> 03:04:45,925
right up in the face of Hotis, personally.

2422
03:04:45,925 --> 03:04:48,223
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine. Bring it.

2423
03:04:48,223 --> 03:04:53,097
MATT: End of Keyleth's turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Thorbir, you're on deck.

2424
03:04:53,097 --> 03:05:07,308
ORION: Okay. Fine. I'm going to attempt to cast
Slow on both of them.

2425
03:05:07,308 --> 03:05:08,633
MATT: On both of them?

2426
03:05:08,633 --> 03:05:15,129
ORION: 40-foot cube, 120-foot range. Center it
where it won't hurt anybody else except for them.

2427
03:05:15,129 --> 03:05:28,810
Actually, I think I can pick who I affect. And
that's what I do. Slow down. I think that will

2428
03:05:28,810 --> 03:05:30,963
affect the rakshasa.

2429
03:05:30,963 --> 03:05:35,195
MATT: What's the DC on it?

2430
03:05:35,195 --> 03:05:36,905
ORION: 17.

2431
03:05:36,905 --> 03:05:45,854
MATT: 17. The golem-like creature-- which, if you
want to make an arcana check right now, see if you

2432
03:05:45,854 --> 03:05:48,891
can ID it.

2433
03:05:48,891 --> 03:05:50,326
ORION: 21.

2434
03:05:50,326 --> 03:05:53,839
MATT: 21. You haven't seen one of these before,
but you've heard about it in passing, and you feel

2435
03:05:53,839 --> 03:05:58,609
like there was a story once about it. It's
referred to as a shield guardian. It is linked to

2436
03:05:58,609 --> 03:06:03,736
whoever wears the amulet and manages to share
damage, should the wearer take damage.

2437
03:06:03,736 --> 03:06:07,685
WILL: Oh, that's interesting to know.

2438
03:06:07,685 --> 03:06:15,091
MATT: It also slowly repairs itself over time. So
yes. You cast Slow. The rakshasa appears

2439
03:06:15,091 --> 03:06:22,932
unaffected. However, the guardian's movements do
seem to shimmer and shake as it's forcing its way

2440
03:06:22,932 --> 03:06:26,049
through the arcane net you've now cast around it.

2441
03:06:26,049 --> 03:06:30,000
ORION: Cool. So now it takes a negative two
penalty to its AC and its dexterity saving throws,

2442
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,867
and it can't use reactions.

2443
03:06:31,867 --> 03:06:33,090
MATT: Yep.

2444
03:06:33,090 --> 03:06:40,917
ORION: Sweet. And I move as far away from
everything as I can.

2445
03:06:40,917 --> 03:06:48,668
MATT: Okay. So where are you going? Over here?
That's about as far as you can get away from

2446
03:06:48,668 --> 03:06:49,652
everything.

2447
03:06:49,652 --> 03:06:50,702
ORION: That's what I do.

2448
03:06:50,702 --> 03:06:52,437
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Thorbir.

2449
03:06:52,437 --> 03:06:55,998
WIL: Am I close enough to charge up and hit that
guardian?

2450
03:06:55,998 --> 03:07:01,004
MATT: You could. You could probably leap over
these. You could do that.

2451
03:07:01,004 --> 03:07:02,914
WIL: I would like to do that.

2452
03:07:02,914 --> 03:07:10,498
MATT: Okay. You leap across, grin and bear it as
you dodge over the bits of acid, cringing.

2453
03:07:10,498 --> 03:07:12,569
WIL: I'm accustomed to failure.

2454
03:07:12,569 --> 03:07:15,603
MATT: And you rush up to the side with your axe
and?

2455
03:07:15,603 --> 03:07:27,033
WIL: I'm going to use an action surge, so I get an
additional action. So that was my move, right? So

2456
03:07:27,033 --> 03:07:36,292
my additional action will be to make my attack.
Does that mean I get to do six attacks?

2457
03:07:36,292 --> 03:07:40,369
WILL: That's going to be six points! Go for it.

2458
03:07:40,369 --> 03:07:44,756
WIL: I know, right? Okay. If I'm going to use a
maneuver, do I have to declare it ahead of time?

2459
03:07:44,756 --> 03:07:45,984
MATT: I would say yes.

2460
03:07:45,984 --> 03:07:49,568
WIL: This is a commander's strike.

2461
03:07:49,568 --> 03:07:51,982
LIAM: Here we go. This is science.

2462
03:07:51,982 --> 03:07:55,283
WIL: 23.

2463
03:07:55,283 --> 03:07:56,694
MATT: That hits, yeah!

2464
03:07:56,694 --> 03:08:03,540
WIL: All right. This is a commander's strike.
"When you take the attack action on your turn, you

2465
03:08:03,540 --> 03:08:08,608
"can forego one of your attacks and use a bonus
action to direct one of your companions to strike.

2466
03:08:08,608 --> 03:08:12,635
"When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can
see you or hear you and expend a superiority die.

2467
03:08:12,635 --> 03:08:17,427
"That creature can immediately use its reaction to
make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die

2468
03:08:17,427 --> 03:08:23,743
"to the attack's damage roll." So I would like to
direct the tiger thing to attack the tiger thing.

2469
03:08:23,743 --> 03:08:24,916
MARISHA: I'm there.

2470
03:08:24,916 --> 03:08:26,182
WIL: Can I do that?

2471
03:08:26,182 --> 03:08:27,089
MATT: You can, yeah.

2472
03:08:27,089 --> 03:08:30,111
WIL: So that's with my first attack situation.

2473
03:08:30,111 --> 03:08:32,431
MATT: So first, roll your damage from the strike.

2474
03:08:32,431 --> 03:08:42,636
WIL: Six plus six slashing damage. 12 slash.

2475
03:08:42,636 --> 03:08:44,024
MATT: 12 slashing. Nice.

2476
03:08:44,024 --> 03:08:51,588
WIL: Do I roll the superiority die for her, or
does she roll it?

2477
03:08:51,588 --> 03:08:54,103
MATT: You give it to her. You can roll it now, and
she'll add it to her damage.

2478
03:08:54,103 --> 03:08:55,861
WIL: You don't want to touch this, so just roll a
d10.

2479
03:08:55,861 --> 03:08:57,073
MARISHA: Good to know.

2480
03:08:57,073 --> 03:09:07,240
MATT: So now he looks to you and gives you the
opportunity to attack the rakshasa as a reaction.

2481
03:09:07,240 --> 03:09:12,435
MARISHA: (roars) So I'm going to do my bite
attack. And I get to add this?

2482
03:09:12,435 --> 03:09:13,951
MATT: To your damage.

2483
03:09:13,951 --> 03:09:17,888
MARISHA: To damage? Okay, so that's 15?

2484
03:09:17,888 --> 03:09:25,119
MATT: 15 misses. You strike out and the rakshasa
right at your face ducks out of the way and has a

2485
03:09:25,119 --> 03:09:28,661
small cane to its side that it knocks your strike
to the side.

2486
03:09:28,905 --> 03:09:30,942
MARISHA: Sorry.

2487
03:09:30,942 --> 03:09:32,701
WIL: That's all right. Second attack.

2488
03:09:32,701 --> 03:09:34,484
MARISHA: Do I get to keep this, or was that the
only time?

2489
03:09:34,484 --> 03:09:35,671
MATT: That's the only time.

2490
03:09:35,671 --> 03:09:38,039
WIL: Ha! That's a two.

2491
03:09:38,039 --> 03:09:43,064
MATT: All right. You hit the side of its armor and
deflects off the side with a loud ringing sound.

2492
03:09:43,064 --> 03:09:53,941
WIL: Attack number three is a three. I'm guessing
13 is not good enough to hit that thing?

2493
03:09:53,941 --> 03:09:55,443
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

2494
03:09:55,443 --> 03:09:59,361
WIL: Okay, attack number four is a 27!

2495
03:09:59,361 --> 03:10:00,950
MATT: Hits!

2496
03:10:00,950 --> 03:10:02,275
WIL: How about that.

2497
03:10:02,275 --> 03:10:04,159
MATT: Roll some damage on that one.

2498
03:10:04,159 --> 03:10:13,940
WIL: This is going to be-- shoot, sorry. My thing
got moved around. Apologies. Sorry! This is

2499
03:10:13,940 --> 03:10:25,027
ruining the dramatic tension. This is a precision
attack, so I use a superiority die and I add it to

2500
03:10:25,027 --> 03:10:28,094
my damage roll, right?

2501
03:10:28,094 --> 03:10:29,955
MATT: That's added to your attack.

2502
03:10:29,955 --> 03:10:36,649
WIL: Son of a bitch! All right. Never mind, then
I'm just going to roll regular damage. That's one

2503
03:10:36,649 --> 03:10:38,113
plus six is seven.

2504
03:10:38,113 --> 03:10:39,537
MATT: Seven damage.

2505
03:10:39,537 --> 03:10:40,944
WIL: Fifth attack.

2506
03:10:40,944 --> 03:10:42,372
MATT: You have two more.

2507
03:10:42,372 --> 03:10:49,744
WIL: That's another one.

2508
03:10:49,744 --> 03:10:51,551
MATT: Roll your last one.

2509
03:10:51,622 --> 03:10:56,220
WIL: All right, here's my last attack. Oh, it's an
18! I crit on an 18!

2510
03:10:56,220 --> 03:10:57,921
MARISHA: You crit on an 18?

2511
03:10:57,921 --> 03:11:02,486
WIL: I crit on an 18. Son of a bitch! No, I don't!
Fuck me.

2512
03:11:02,486 --> 03:11:04,931
LIAM: Even your memory betrays you, Wheaton.

2513
03:11:04,931 --> 03:11:06,932
WIL: I know. It does. 28?

2514
03:11:06,932 --> 03:11:10,009
MATT: 28 I think will hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2515
03:11:10,009 --> 03:11:15,685
WIL: Great. Oh, and let me look at these things
and see if any of this useless stuff is going to

2516
03:11:15,685 --> 03:11:22,613
do any good for me at all. Oh, you know what? I'm
going to use this as a maneuvering attack. I can

2517
03:11:22,613 --> 03:11:31,516
expend a superiority die to maneuver one of my
comrades into a more advantageous position. One of

2518
03:11:31,516 --> 03:11:35,539
my comrades can move-- there's no point in doing
that. I thought I could move the bad guy, which is

2519
03:11:35,539 --> 03:11:43,114
what I could do if I had a pushing attack. All
right, so. Can I use my riposte? When a creature

2520
03:11:43,114 --> 03:11:46,078
misses you with a melee attack, use your reaction
and expend a die to

2521
03:11:46,078 --> 03:11:47,702
make a melee attack against it.

2522
03:11:47,730 --> 03:11:49,150
MATT: You'd do that if it attacks you.

2523
03:11:49,150 --> 03:11:51,431
WIL: Great. Okay, so I'm just going to remember
that I have that.

2524
03:11:51,431 --> 03:11:55,107
MATT: Just do your damage.

2525
03:11:55,107 --> 03:11:56,275
WIL: 13.

2526
03:11:56,275 --> 03:12:01,290
MATT: All righty. So out of the six strikes, three
make contact. You're starting to carve sections

2527
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:06,684
into the leathery connecting areas of the shield
guardian. You're doing damage, but it's still

2528
03:12:06,684 --> 03:12:13,114
pretty hardy and holding itself up. That ends your
turn, Thorbir? Up at the top. Hotis, who is

2529
03:12:13,114 --> 03:12:26,723
unhappy and next to you, is going to disengage
here.

2530
03:12:26,723 --> 03:12:28,697
MARISHA: Do I get a free attack?

2531
03:12:28,697 --> 03:12:30,230
MATT: You do, yes.

2532
03:12:30,230 --> 03:12:36,307
MARISHA: (growls) Nope.

2533
03:12:36,307 --> 03:12:48,240
MATT: Nope? Okay. He's actually going to stay back
here and is going to look over and glance at...

2534
03:12:48,240 --> 03:13:00,579
yeah, he's going to glance at you, Vax. You see
this time, it pulls itself back and with this

2535
03:13:00,579 --> 03:13:07,535
grin, it catches your eye and has a slight shine
to its connection. It whispers something under its

2536
03:13:07,535 --> 03:13:09,785
breath. Make a wisdom saving throw.

2537
03:13:09,785 --> 03:13:11,040
LIAM: But with advantage.

2538
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:16,651
MARISHA: Advantage! I'm so glad I made such a
hearty meal.

2539
03:13:16,651 --> 03:13:18,897
LIAM: Ugh, 15.

2540
03:13:18,897 --> 03:13:21,436
MATT: 15 total?

2541
03:13:21,436 --> 03:13:23,067
LIAM: Yeah.

2542
03:13:23,067 --> 03:13:29,520
MATT: All right. For the second time in a row,
your mind is not your own.

2543
03:13:29,520 --> 03:13:32,809
LIAM: (robotic) I will kill you all.

2544
03:13:32,809 --> 03:13:37,552
MATT: You feel the will of the rakshasa take your
mind as you are dominated by it.

2545
03:13:37,552 --> 03:13:40,045
MARISHA: Is this something he can save from,
though?

2546
03:13:40,045 --> 03:13:42,446
ORION: What happened? Is a spell being cast?

2547
03:13:42,446 --> 03:13:44,048
LIAM: I'm possessed, man.

2548
03:13:44,048 --> 03:13:45,822
ORION: Oh, Counterspell. 4th level.

2549
03:13:45,822 --> 03:13:49,143
MATT: You currently don't have visual on him.

2550
03:13:49,143 --> 03:13:53,448
LIAM: Besides, you should have done that shit
already! The moment already happened. I'm

2551
03:13:53,448 --> 03:13:55,065
possessed.

2552
03:13:55,065 --> 03:13:57,348
ORION: Shut up. I'm trying to save you.

2553
03:13:57,348 --> 03:13:58,825
LIAM: You can't retcon that shit.

2554
03:13:58,825 --> 03:14:00,478
WIL: Same team!

2555
03:14:00,478 --> 03:14:04,402
MATT: There's a big statue between the two of you,
unfortunately, the ten-foot statue, so you

2556
03:14:04,402 --> 03:14:10,333
wouldn't have visual on it when it cast the spell.
This is the big statue, right there. So you are

2557
03:14:10,333 --> 03:14:19,922
currently dominated. It is now your turn. The
rakshasa is going to send you up behind Kash.

2558
03:14:19,922 --> 03:14:23,544
LIAM: Let's cut the guest visitor because really.
Really?

2559
03:14:23,544 --> 03:14:28,785
MATT: (laughs) It makes sense. He comes in and
heals the party and is closest to you and has no

2560
03:14:28,785 --> 03:14:33,077
idea that you're currently turned against the rest
of your allies. Make an attack on him.

2561
03:14:33,077 --> 03:14:34,551
WILL: I'm attacking him?

2562
03:14:34,551 --> 03:14:36,131
MATT: He's attacking you.

2563
03:14:36,131 --> 03:14:37,687
WILL: You suck.

2564
03:14:37,687 --> 03:14:46,222
LIAM: And I'm hasted. My boots are hasted. So here
I go. Oh, that's good. That is a 23.

2565
03:14:46,222 --> 03:14:47,609
MATT: 23 hits.

2566
03:14:47,609 --> 03:14:49,848
LIAM: Should I do damage on all of these?

2567
03:14:49,848 --> 03:14:51,852
MATT: Go ahead and do your sneak attack damage on
this one.

2568
03:14:51,852 --> 03:14:54,289
LIAM: All right, but there's no sneak attack, so
not that bad.

2569
03:14:54,289 --> 03:14:56,194
MATT: I will say this. Make a perception check.

2570
03:14:56,194 --> 03:15:04,237
WILL: Okay. I perceive I'm going to get my ass
kicked. Oh, good! 23.

2571
03:15:04,237 --> 03:15:09,471
MATT: 23. You just catch, out of the corner of
your eye, as Vax turns towards you, weapons drawn,

2572
03:15:09,471 --> 03:15:13,405
and swooshes up to your side. You get the
sensation that his mind is not his own, since this

2573
03:15:13,405 --> 03:15:17,583
has already happened once today. Doing so, you
turn to face him, negating the sneak attack.

2574
03:15:17,583 --> 03:15:19,502
You're aware of it. So you don't get sneak attack
damage.

2575
03:15:19,502 --> 03:15:26,355
LIAM: Great. Good. I mean, let's kill this guy. I
love you, rakshasa! Okay, so that first one hit

2576
03:15:26,355 --> 03:15:35,769
for eight. The second one is a natural 20.
(carving noises) You're already cut up. You don't

2577
03:15:35,769 --> 03:15:37,102
even know.

2578
03:15:37,102 --> 03:15:40,205
MATT: So first one was eight damage, so you take
eight damage.

2579
03:15:40,205 --> 03:15:43,651
LIAM: This is not sneak attack, so it's not the
worst it could be.

2580
03:15:43,651 --> 03:15:48,084
WILL: (laughing) It's not the worst it could be.
Thanks. I'm not stabbing you the worst I could.

2581
03:15:48,084 --> 03:15:56,664
LIAM: That was my life-stealing dagger, and on a
natural 20, I get the ten hit points that I cut

2582
03:15:56,664 --> 03:16:00,406
from him. Or whatever I get, I guess.

2583
03:16:00,406 --> 03:16:03,948
WILL: Do it without the smile. Do it without the
little smile!

2584
03:16:03,948 --> 03:16:06,775
(laughter)

2585
03:16:06,775 --> 03:16:09,993
WILL: Just do it without the tiny little smile!

2586
03:16:09,993 --> 03:16:13,079
LIAM: It was seven, which is doubled to 14.

2587
03:16:13,079 --> 03:16:16,033
MATT: The dice is doubled, and then you add the
modifier.

2588
03:16:16,033 --> 03:16:24,719
LIAM: Oh, okay. Oh, so that's much less, then.
That is an eight. And then I get ten hit points.

2589
03:16:24,719 --> 03:16:27,512
How does it work? It says I get ten hit points, so
I just get ten, or

2590
03:16:27,512 --> 03:16:29,612
do I get up to what I cut him for?

2591
03:16:29,612 --> 03:16:33,162
MATT: You deal damage, and then you heal yourself
ten hit points, draining the life of whatever you

2592
03:16:33,162 --> 03:16:34,221
damaged.

2593
03:16:34,221 --> 03:16:35,670
LIAM: Well, the good news is, I'm back up to
full.

2594
03:16:35,670 --> 03:16:37,169
WILL: Oh, that is good news.

2595
03:16:37,169 --> 03:16:40,306
MATT: So you took another eight damage.

2596
03:16:40,306 --> 03:16:41,768
WILL: I took another eight? Sweet.

2597
03:16:41,768 --> 03:16:45,878
LIAM: Here comes that third dagger, man. This one
is poisonous. And that hits.

2598
03:16:45,878 --> 03:16:49,416
WILL: (laughs) Shit.

2599
03:16:49,416 --> 03:16:51,262
MARISHA: Take Wil's dice.

2600
03:16:51,262 --> 03:17:00,669
WILL: Again, you can't get the smile off your
face! It's etched in there permanently! You suck!

2601
03:17:00,669 --> 03:17:01,675
Look at that.

2602
03:17:01,675 --> 03:17:06,512
LIAM: That is an eight, plus the poison has a DC
of 15.

2603
03:17:06,512 --> 03:17:11,914
MATT: Take another eight damage, and then make a
constitution saving throw.

2604
03:17:11,914 --> 03:17:15,286
LIAM: Roll a 15 or higher, please, Will.

2605
03:17:15,286 --> 03:17:16,520
MARISHA: Nope.

2606
03:17:16,520 --> 03:17:18,913
MATT: That's okay. You guys are immune to poison,
thanks to the meal that she made.

2607
03:17:18,913 --> 03:17:20,143
MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

2608
03:17:20,143 --> 03:17:26,212
MATT: So as he eviscerates you with the daggers,
most of the armor's absorbing a lot of the blows

2609
03:17:26,212 --> 03:17:29,863
and you're feeling the impact and one of them
catches you in the side, and you feel the poison

2610
03:17:29,863 --> 03:17:36,674
pulse into your system, but your physical body
shuts it down, and you feel yourself unaffected.

2611
03:17:36,674 --> 03:17:38,376
LIAM: Sorry! I'm so sorry!

2612
03:17:38,376 --> 03:17:43,251
WILL: And I want to look at him and go, why are
you smiling the whole time?!

2613
03:17:43,251 --> 03:17:46,134
LIAM: He's putting it on my face. I can't help
it.

2614
03:17:46,134 --> 03:17:48,165
WILL: The whole time, you're smiling!

2615
03:17:48,165 --> 03:17:49,785
LIAM: I'm so guilty.

2616
03:17:49,785 --> 03:17:54,195
MATT: Your turn to make another wisdom saving
throw with advantage to try and resist it.

2617
03:17:54,195 --> 03:18:00,663
LIAM: With advantage. 19 or a five. So I'll take
the 19. 21.

2618
03:18:00,663 --> 03:18:02,659
MATT: You've resisted the effect. Domination
fades.

2619
03:18:02,659 --> 03:18:05,637
LIAM: Oh man. I feel so bad about this.

2620
03:18:05,637 --> 03:18:09,036
WILL: You don't. I don't buy that face at all. I
don't buy it at all!

2621
03:18:09,036 --> 03:18:10,881
MATT: Kash, it's your turn.

2622
03:18:10,881 --> 03:18:14,159
WILL: Oh. Wow. My turn, huh?

2623
03:18:14,159 --> 03:18:16,331
LIAM: Channel it to where it matters.

2624
03:18:16,331 --> 03:18:21,257
WILL: (laughs) Yeah, but see, I'm the guest. Where
it matters is just getting some revenge.

2625
03:18:21,257 --> 03:18:26,760
So he is still--

2626
03:18:26,760 --> 03:18:28,878
LIAM: No, I'm good. I'm out.

2627
03:18:28,878 --> 03:18:32,277
MATT: As he finishes attacking, he goes, (grunts,
pants).

2628
03:18:32,277 --> 03:18:35,113
MARISHA: Oh, did you save from it? Dope.

2629
03:18:35,113 --> 03:18:40,919
WILL: I have to heal myself, somehow. I have to,
or I'm just not going to be around for a while.

2630
03:18:40,919 --> 03:18:42,834
MARISHA: Do it. We need our healer.

2631
03:18:42,834 --> 03:18:45,099
ORION: Take a potion.

2632
03:18:45,099 --> 03:18:47,203
WILL: I don't have any potions.

2633
03:18:47,203 --> 03:18:50,176
WIL: A healer dying would be like your warrior
never being able to hit anything.

2634
03:18:50,176 --> 03:18:52,310
WILL: That would be crazy!

2635
03:18:52,310 --> 03:18:56,904
MARISHA: I know. It's crazy, because it scales for
players.

2636
03:18:56,904 --> 03:19:02,340
WILL: I have one more level five. Oh, I can do a
level-6 Heal, if I wanted to, but I want to hold

2637
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:05,775
onto my level six. I think I'm going to do my last
level-5 Mass Cure Wounds.

2638
03:19:05,775 --> 03:19:07,766
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2639
03:19:07,766 --> 03:19:09,509
MARISHA: And that does to everybody?

2640
03:19:09,509 --> 03:19:21,510
WILL: Yeah. Everybody within a certain radius.
Hang on. Six creatures. Oh, you're full? That must

2641
03:19:21,510 --> 03:19:22,396
be nice.

2642
03:19:22,396 --> 03:19:28,217
MATT: 30-foot radius sphere. You can hit everybody
here, for the most part. You can hit all of your

2643
03:19:28,217 --> 03:19:29,116
allies there.

2644
03:19:29,116 --> 03:19:31,198
WILL: And 3d8 plus--

2645
03:19:31,198 --> 03:19:37,104
MATT: Plus five, and then plus an additional
seven. So it would be plus 12. 3d8 plus 12.

2646
03:19:37,104 --> 03:19:46,534
WILL: 3d8 plus 12. Okay, that's the same thing as
last time, so 17 plus 12.

2647
03:19:46,534 --> 03:19:48,302
MATT: 29.

2648
03:19:48,302 --> 03:19:49,647
WILL: Again, 29. Yeah.

2649
03:19:49,647 --> 03:19:57,011
MATT: So everyone heals 29 hit points. That is the
end of your 5th-level spells. You are out of

2650
03:19:57,011 --> 03:19:58,043
5th-levels.

2651
03:19:58,043 --> 03:20:00,144
WILL: I am now out of 5th-level spells.

2652
03:20:00,144 --> 03:20:15,101
MATT: All right. That ends Kash's turn. The shield
guardian is going to turn this way and is going to

2653
03:20:15,101 --> 03:20:17,007
attempt to pummel on you.

2654
03:20:17,007 --> 03:20:18,722
WIL: Let's do this.

2655
03:20:18,722 --> 03:20:22,449
WILL: Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

2656
03:20:22,449 --> 03:20:24,394
MATT: That is a 25 to hit.

2657
03:20:24,394 --> 03:20:26,437
WIL: Oh, it turns out that that hits me.

2658
03:20:26,437 --> 03:20:30,218
MATT: (laughs) The second one is a 13.

2659
03:20:30,218 --> 03:20:31,655
WIL: That does not hit me.

2660
03:20:31,655 --> 03:20:39,972
MATT: Okay, so the first one hits you for 12
points of bludgeoning damage as the fist slams

2661
03:20:39,972 --> 03:20:45,423
into you. Second one comes down, and you manage to
knock it away with the edge of your axe,

2662
03:20:45,423 --> 03:20:55,446
bulldogging up in its face. It also heals itself
ten hit points. As it begins to repair its form with

2663
03:20:55,446 --> 03:21:00,259
each progressive round, the magic energy is
sealing up the cracks and divots its armor is

2664
03:21:00,259 --> 03:21:04,434
taking. This leads to the end of its turn.
Keyleth, you're up.

2665
03:21:04,434 --> 03:21:12,114
MARISHA: All right. I'm still pretty close to the
rakshasa, right?

2666
03:21:12,114 --> 03:21:13,130
MATT: Correct.

2667
03:21:13,130 --> 03:21:17,426
MARISHA: All right, hitting it with my bite
attack. Ooh, that's much better.

2668
03:21:17,426 --> 03:21:18,918
Chopper, sic balls.

2669
03:21:18,918 --> 03:21:24,588
WIL: That's not what I heard. I heard, Chopper,
sic kid.

2670
03:21:24,588 --> 03:21:27,732
(laughter)

2671
03:21:27,732 --> 03:21:33,695
MARISHA: That just made my night, in many ways.
Okay, 21.

2672
03:21:33,695 --> 03:21:38,183
MATT: That does hit. However, are your natural
weapons magical?

2673
03:21:38,183 --> 03:21:41,008
MARISHA: Yes, they are, because Circle of the
Moon, baby.

2674
03:21:41,008 --> 03:21:45,862
MATT: That's right. So yes, you do bypass his
nonmagical physical immunity.

2675
03:21:45,862 --> 03:21:53,826
MARISHA: Yes, I do. Circle of the Moon. So that
does 1d10 plus six piercing damage. Where's my

2676
03:21:53,826 --> 03:22:08,095
d10s? That's eight piercing damage from my bite.
(growls) And then I do my claws,

2677
03:22:08,095 --> 03:22:10,096
which happen twice.

2678
03:22:10,096 --> 03:22:14,422
MATT: So what's the damage total on that?

2679
03:22:14,422 --> 03:22:21,380
MARISHA: That was eight damage. Piercing damage.
And then yeah, that's good, too.

2680
03:22:21,380 --> 03:22:24,784
MATT: And what's your alignment?

2681
03:22:24,784 --> 03:22:31,181
MARISHA: What's my alignment? I'm good. I'm
Keyleth. I'm neutral good.

2682
03:22:31,181 --> 03:22:32,609
MATT: Just checking.

2683
03:22:32,609 --> 03:22:34,403
LIAM: She's becoming the Destroyer!

2684
03:22:34,403 --> 03:22:36,523
MATT: And the other two attacks are?

2685
03:22:36,523 --> 03:22:38,494
MARISHA: 22 for the first one.

2686
03:22:38,494 --> 03:22:39,826
MATT: Hits.

2687
03:22:39,826 --> 03:22:44,138
MARISHA: Hang on, do I get two claw attacks, or
just one?

2688
03:22:44,138 --> 03:22:45,621
ORION: Did you say "clow?"

2689
03:22:45,621 --> 03:22:47,055
MARISHA: "Clow." My "clows."

2690
03:22:47,055 --> 03:22:50,324
MATT: What does it say for the multi-attack of the
tiger form?

2691
03:22:50,324 --> 03:22:57,949
MARISHA: It says-- oh, wait.

2692
03:22:57,949 --> 03:23:02,294
MATT: Saber-toothed tiger is the form.

2693
03:23:02,294 --> 03:23:12,965
MARISHA: Yeah. I have a pounce. I guess I don't
have a multi-attack. So I just have the bite

2694
03:23:12,965 --> 03:23:18,556
attack? Or do I also get a claw attack, as well,
as my two actions?

2695
03:23:18,556 --> 03:23:20,137
MATT: You do not have multi-attack with that
creature.

2696
03:23:20,137 --> 03:23:24,209
MARISHA: One is piercing, and one is slashing,
right? So I'll do my bite. (growls)

2697
03:23:24,209 --> 03:23:30,704
MATT: You bite in and as you do, it (groans) hits
you with its elbow, its backward-turned hand

2698
03:23:30,704 --> 03:23:36,537
trying to grasp out and push you off. As it tears
you away, you got a chunk of its meat. And for

2699
03:23:36,537 --> 03:23:43,159
some reason, you did a lot more damage than you
thought you would. You hit some sort of vulnerable

2700
03:23:43,159 --> 03:23:48,832
point in its body, or there's something about the
attack method that it did not like. (gasps, roars)

2701
03:23:48,832 --> 03:23:53,902
It hisses at you with this guttural tiger growl.
Tiger on tiger.

2702
03:23:53,902 --> 03:23:56,116
MARISHA: I go, (growls) right back to him.

2703
03:23:56,116 --> 03:24:00,255
MATT: You going to stay put, or are you going to
move away?

2704
03:24:00,255 --> 03:24:02,094
MARISHA: I'm up in his ass.

2705
03:24:02,094 --> 03:24:03,319
MATT: All right, so you're staying right there.

2706
03:24:03,319 --> 03:24:06,001
WILL: There's another website for that.

2707
03:24:06,001 --> 03:24:09,882
MATT: All right. Tiberius, you're up.

2708
03:24:09,882 --> 03:24:22,779
ORION: Move me in sight range of both of them. As
a good sorcerer would be positioned.

2709
03:24:22,779 --> 03:24:25,048
MATT: There.

2710
03:24:25,048 --> 03:24:28,860
ORION: I'll cast Silence right in the center of
the room.

2711
03:24:28,860 --> 03:24:30,018
MATT: Center of the room?

2712
03:24:30,018 --> 03:24:31,219
ORION: Yep.

2713
03:24:31,219 --> 03:24:32,248
MATT: All right.

2714
03:24:32,248 --> 03:24:33,596
ORION: Not hitting Kashaw.

2715
03:24:33,596 --> 03:24:39,364
MATT: Okay. There is an orb of Silence here that
fills the vicinity. All righty.

2716
03:24:39,364 --> 03:24:41,756
ORION: And I sit in Indian-style position.

2717
03:24:41,756 --> 03:24:45,738
LIAM: It's called crisscross applesauce now.

2718
03:24:45,738 --> 03:24:54,853
ORION: Now cast stuff, butthole! I dissipate my
Greater Invisibility spell so it can see me.

2719
03:24:54,853 --> 03:25:02,343
MATT: All right. Your visibility comes back. All
righty. That ends Tiberius's turn.

2720
03:25:02,343 --> 03:25:03,775
Thorbir, you're up.

2721
03:25:03,775 --> 03:25:13,452
WIL: I am attacking the guardian again, and I will
be doing another one of my commander's strikes.

2722
03:25:13,452 --> 03:25:15,021
MATT: Go for it.

2723
03:25:15,021 --> 03:25:16,796
WIL: 21.

2724
03:25:16,796 --> 03:25:18,020
MATT: That hits.

2725
03:25:18,020 --> 03:25:22,917
WIL: So I will direct you, again, to hit the
dude.

2726
03:25:22,917 --> 03:25:29,583
MARISHA: (growls) Bite. No. Son of a cock.

2727
03:25:29,583 --> 03:25:33,548
WIL: I rolled a 12 on my die, so 18. 18 points of
damage.

2728
03:25:33,548 --> 03:25:36,301
MARISHA: Nothing for me.

2729
03:25:36,301 --> 03:25:37,454
MATT: What did you roll?

2730
03:25:37,454 --> 03:25:40,641
MARISHA: Four, so 13 total.

2731
03:25:40,641 --> 03:25:43,957
MATT: It adds to the damage roll, not the attack.

2732
03:25:43,957 --> 03:25:47,700
WIL: Damn it! I keep looking at it and expecting
it to change.

2733
03:25:47,700 --> 03:25:50,204
MATT: That's okay. Your first attack hit. You have
two more.

2734
03:25:50,204 --> 03:25:54,777
WIL: Yeah. My second attack against the guardian.
16?

2735
03:25:54,777 --> 03:26:01,042
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately. It beats
away the edge of your blade

2736
03:26:01,042 --> 03:26:02,688
with one of its giant fists.

2737
03:26:02,688 --> 03:26:07,098
WIL: And my last attack. 23?

2738
03:26:07,098 --> 03:26:12,251
MATT: 23 hits. As it pulls back from knocking away
your blade, you use the inertia to spin it around

2739
03:26:12,251 --> 03:26:14,430
and come down on top with your axe.

2740
03:26:14,430 --> 03:26:20,325
WIL: Hey, I have a dumb question, and I'm sorry.
This is at your discretion, but I can add a d10 to

2741
03:26:20,325 --> 03:26:23,438
my attack roll after I've made the attack roll.

2742
03:26:23,438 --> 03:26:32,802
MATT: You add it before I tell you if it hit or
missed. So you can roll and be like, "I don't know

2743
03:26:32,802 --> 03:26:34,777
"if that will hit or not. Let me add my dice to
it."

2744
03:26:34,777 --> 03:26:43,104
WIL: I get it. So I'm going to hit again. 11.

2745
03:26:43,104 --> 03:26:49,194
MATT: 11. All righty. Knocked away, and then come
down with a third hit, cracking in the center of

2746
03:26:49,194 --> 03:26:51,597
the breastplate. The breastplate actually
separates slightly. You can see a little of the

2747
03:26:51,597 --> 03:26:56,208
arcane energy holding it together underneath.
Starting to knock some damage into it. You can see

2748
03:26:56,208 --> 03:27:00,425
it's taken a little wear and tear. It's still
pretty hefty, but you're starting to dig into the

2749
03:27:00,425 --> 03:27:03,652
shield guardian. Does that end your turn?

2750
03:27:03,652 --> 03:27:08,456
WIL: Can I use second wind? It says I can take it
as a bonus action, but I don't know how bonus

2751
03:27:08,456 --> 03:27:09,757
actions work.

2752
03:27:09,757 --> 03:27:12,707
MATT: You get one bonus action every turn, if you
have an ability that uses one.

2753
03:27:12,707 --> 03:27:18,151
WIL: Oh, great. So I get hit points equal to d10
plus my fighter level.

2754
03:27:18,151 --> 03:27:21,781
MATT: Go for it.

2755
03:27:21,781 --> 03:27:23,543
WIL: 11 plus ten is 21.

2756
03:27:23,543 --> 03:27:32,103
MATT: There you go. Very nice. Ends your turn.
Back at the top. That is Hotis's turn. Hotis

2757
03:27:32,103 --> 03:27:41,170
begins looking at itself. It moves. It gets an
attack from you, Marisha.

2758
03:27:41,170 --> 03:27:48,150
MARISHA: That's 20.

2759
03:27:48,150 --> 03:27:49,848
MATT: So that does hit.

2760
03:27:49,848 --> 03:28:02,873
MARISHA: Awesome. I'm going to do my bite attack
again. Oh, wait. That's a d20. Eight damage.

2761
03:28:02,873 --> 03:28:04,774
Piercing damage again.

2762
03:28:04,774 --> 03:28:09,507
MATT: All right. You strike. Once again, as it
runs by, you get a chunk out of it and it (grunts)

2763
03:28:09,507 --> 03:28:14,405
growls in anger and pain. You notice at the same
time that she takes the bite out of it, the

2764
03:28:14,405 --> 03:28:22,657
guardian shudders, like it suddenly took an impact
on its own. As it charges away, though, it runs

2765
03:28:22,657 --> 03:28:49,833
out of the field of Silence... It is going to
begin casting a spell on itself, and immediately

2766
03:28:49,833 --> 03:29:01,500
drifts up toward the ceiling. It is now currently
flying in the room about ten feet up right now.

2767
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:03,135
WILL: He's flying now?

2768
03:29:03,135 --> 03:29:06,443
ORION: I can do that, too!

2769
03:29:06,443 --> 03:29:09,271
MATT: That's going to end its turn. Vax, you're
up.

2770
03:29:09,271 --> 03:29:11,764
LIAM: I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.

2771
03:29:11,764 --> 03:29:13,107
MATT: Okay.

2772
03:29:13,107 --> 03:29:16,859
LIAM: 27.

2773
03:29:16,859 --> 03:29:18,922
MATT: 27. Okay.

2774
03:29:18,922 --> 03:29:32,504
LIAM: Two daggers out of the dark. I'll keep that.
That is a 30.

2775
03:29:32,504 --> 03:29:36,992
MATT: Remember, in order to properly hide, you
would have to go somewhere where you would remain

2776
03:29:36,992 --> 03:29:38,653
out of the sight of the individual.

2777
03:29:38,653 --> 03:29:40,452
LIAM: Can I squat down behind Kash?

2778
03:29:40,452 --> 03:29:42,011
WILL: Wait, whoa.

2779
03:29:42,011 --> 03:29:47,670
LIAM: All right, you tell me. I don't know how
bright or dark it is in here.

2780
03:29:47,670 --> 03:29:50,534
MATT: Hiding behind another party member is a
little hard to do.

2781
03:29:50,534 --> 03:29:56,407
LIAM: Can I run, Naruto-style, low, now he's
behind me, toward the statue and crouch at the

2782
03:29:56,407 --> 03:29:58,785
base of it? And then shoot up from there?

2783
03:29:58,785 --> 03:30:09,418
MATT: Yeah. Thanks to your stealth roll, the
guardian does not see you. It can't get a

2784
03:30:09,418 --> 03:30:14,007
reaction, anyway, because it's slowed from you. So
yeah, you're able to scoot around to the side

2785
03:30:14,007 --> 03:30:15,959
there, and then fling the daggers around the
corner. The rakshasa

2786
03:30:15,959 --> 03:30:17,498
apparently has not noticed you.

2787
03:30:17,498 --> 03:30:19,101
LIAM: Okay. First roll was a 30.

2788
03:30:19,101 --> 03:30:22,606
MATT: That hits, and it does do sneak attack
damage.

2789
03:30:22,606 --> 03:30:25,433
ORION: Good job, Lara! I mean, Vax.

2790
03:30:25,433 --> 03:30:30,320
MARISHA: Kill this thing.

2791
03:30:30,320 --> 03:30:40,087
LIAM: (counts quietly) 38, for the one dagger.

2792
03:30:40,087 --> 03:30:49,331
MATT: 38 damage. Okay. First off, when you throw
the dagger, and it strikes, it hits the side of

2793
03:30:49,411 --> 03:30:54,801
the ribcage of the rakshasa who is floating up,
and (grunts) it doubles over in severe pain, more

2794
03:30:54,801 --> 03:30:57,985
than you expected it would be, and it clutches and
tries to grab the dagger to pull it out before it

2795
03:30:57,985 --> 03:31:04,911
vanishes from the wound, leaving the blood pooling
out of it. It looks like it was hurt significantly

2796
03:31:04,911 --> 03:31:09,719
by this attack, more so than you were expecting.
However, at the same time, the shield guardian

2797
03:31:09,719 --> 03:31:17,725
doubles over for a second. The link appears to be
sharing the damage between the two of them.

2798
03:31:17,725 --> 03:31:19,852
MARISHA: Piercing damage, yo.

2799
03:31:19,852 --> 03:31:23,566
WILL: When you hit either one, or just when you
hit the rakshasa?

2800
03:31:23,566 --> 03:31:25,947
MATT: Apparently, just when you hit the rakshasa.

2801
03:31:25,947 --> 03:31:33,195
LIAM: Number two. Probably going to go astray.
That was 14.

2802
03:31:33,195 --> 03:31:47,892
MATT: 14? Nope. All right. So that is Vax's turn.
The rakshasa, you can see, is clutching its side

2803
03:31:47,892 --> 03:31:53,399
now, and there's blood beginning to pool around
its robe and it (pants) is looking around with

2804
03:31:53,454 --> 03:31:58,542
nervous eyes. That brings us to the end of Vax's
turn. Kash, you're up.

2805
03:31:58,542 --> 03:32:01,836
WILL: Who's over here?

2806
03:32:01,836 --> 03:32:03,371
MATT: Over here?

2807
03:32:03,371 --> 03:32:06,859
WILL: No, near the shield warrior. Who's over
there? The shield guardian.

2808
03:32:06,859 --> 03:32:08,777
MATT: This is Thorbir and Vax.

2809
03:32:08,777 --> 03:32:18,842
WILL: Okay. I'm going to move a little bit. Even
though he's floating, I can still move closer to

2810
03:32:18,842 --> 03:32:20,241
the rakshasa, correct?

2811
03:32:20,241 --> 03:32:21,266
MATT: You can, yes.

2812
03:32:21,266 --> 03:32:23,759
WILL: I want to move a little bit closer and then
cast Spiritual Weapon.

2813
03:32:23,759 --> 03:32:29,447
MATT: Okay. All right, so you create a spiritual
weapon of some kind.

2814
03:32:29,447 --> 03:32:30,997
What weapon would you like to create?

2815
03:32:30,997 --> 03:32:32,651
WILL: How about a giant mace?

2816
03:32:32,651 --> 03:32:39,723
MATT: Okay, so as you clutch your holy symbol to
yourself, now there's a sudden pillar of bright,

2817
03:32:39,723 --> 03:32:44,028
vibrant healing light surrounded by that same halo
of pitch-black darkness, almost like this strange

2818
03:32:44,028 --> 03:32:48,093
border around it. This duality hits the
ground, and as it vanishes, you can see on the

2819
03:32:48,093 --> 03:32:55,182
ground this shimmering, almost static-y mace is
left behind, almost flickering in and out of

2820
03:32:55,182 --> 03:32:59,445
existence. It drifts off on its own and is now
hovering in the air next to you.

2821
03:32:59,445 --> 03:33:02,191
WILL: Sweet.

2822
03:33:02,191 --> 03:33:04,709
(laughter)

2823
03:33:04,709 --> 03:33:06,651
MATT: Do you wish to send it up?

2824
03:33:06,651 --> 03:33:12,680
WILL: I do. I wish to send it towards the
rakshasa. Concentrate all fire on the rakshasa.

2825
03:33:12,680 --> 03:33:15,905
MATT: Okay. What's the damage on the magical
weapon?

2826
03:33:15,905 --> 03:33:23,526
WILL: When I cast the spell, I can make a melee
spell attack against a creature within five feet

2827
03:33:23,526 --> 03:33:24,711
of the weapon.

2828
03:33:24,711 --> 03:33:26,871
MATT: All right, so roll a d20 and add your spell
attack bonus.

2829
03:33:26,871 --> 03:33:32,514
WILL: Spell attack bonus is-- 20.

2830
03:33:32,514 --> 03:33:37,147
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage. It's 1d8 plus five,
which is your spell bonus.

2831
03:33:37,147 --> 03:33:38,635
WILL: 1d8.

2832
03:33:38,635 --> 03:33:41,992
MARISHA: All those blue guys. Yeah.

2833
03:33:41,992 --> 03:33:43,903
LIAM: Give him the Al Capone, Kash.

2834
03:33:43,903 --> 03:33:45,781
WILL: Five and five, so ten.

2835
03:33:45,781 --> 03:33:51,720
MATT: Okay. Ten points of damage. All right, so as
it slams into the side, the rakshasa (gasps) takes

2836
03:33:51,720 --> 03:33:55,699
the brunt of it to its arm, and the shield
guardian shudders slightly in the distance.

2837
03:33:55,699 --> 03:34:02,774
WILL: It says that now I can, as a bonus action on
my turn, move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat

2838
03:34:02,774 --> 03:34:07,443
the attack against the creature within five feet
of it. So can I swing it around and attack him

2839
03:34:07,443 --> 03:34:08,736
again from the back?

2840
03:34:08,736 --> 03:34:13,296
MATT: You can use your bonus action to do that,
yes. So it drifts behind and makes a second

2841
03:34:13,296 --> 03:34:14,769
strike. Roll a d20.

2842
03:34:14,769 --> 03:34:15,942
WILL: A d20?

2843
03:34:15,942 --> 03:34:19,154
MATT: A d20 to try and hit. And add your spell
attack bonus.

2844
03:34:19,154 --> 03:34:20,982
WILL: Ten. Damn it.

2845
03:34:20,982 --> 03:34:24,424
MATT: Ten? This time, the rakshasa's a little more
wise to your plan. As it swings around, it

2846
03:34:24,424 --> 03:34:28,909
actually uses its Fly to dip down as it swings,
and then comes back up around in its place,

2847
03:34:28,909 --> 03:34:37,743
gliding and staring at it with a snarl. (snarls) I
believe that ends your turn. Now the shield

2848
03:34:37,743 --> 03:34:50,748
guardian turns this way and now it's taken notice
of the rogue that has run up and eviscerated a

2849
03:34:50,748 --> 03:34:55,688
portion of its master. It's going to pivot in
place and bring both fists

2850
03:34:55,688 --> 03:34:57,813
right down towards you.

2851
03:34:57,813 --> 03:34:59,569
LIAM: I'm going to uncannily dodge.

2852
03:34:59,569 --> 03:35:01,360
MATT: Okay. What does that do, again?

2853
03:35:01,360 --> 03:35:08,008
LIAM: Once a round, I can halve the damage.

2854
03:35:08,008 --> 03:35:17,414
MATT: For one attack, right? Well, that one will
be a 25 to hit?

2855
03:35:17,414 --> 03:35:18,793
LIAM: Oh, yes.

2856
03:35:18,793 --> 03:35:20,727
MATT: And that will be a 14 to hit.

2857
03:35:20,727 --> 03:35:21,724
LIAM: No.

2858
03:35:21,724 --> 03:35:28,287
MATT: So the one that hits you-- 15 damage.
Bludgeoning damage,

2859
03:35:28,287 --> 03:35:31,515
which is halved to eight damage.

2860
03:35:31,515 --> 03:35:34,257
ORION: What's above us?

2861
03:35:34,257 --> 03:35:39,416
MATT: Above you? It's about a 15-foot ceiling. 15
to 20-foot ceiling.

2862
03:35:39,416 --> 03:35:45,066
ORION: Okay. Any light coming down?

2863
03:35:45,066 --> 03:35:49,309
MATT: Nothing in particular, no. You just have the
wall sconces up there. This room has been

2864
03:35:49,309 --> 03:35:53,936
repurposed from its original construction and
hidden away. It looks like it was initially some

2865
03:35:53,936 --> 03:36:03,868
sort of storage or altar room, based on how it was
designed. All right, that ends its turn. Keyleth,

2866
03:36:03,868 --> 03:36:05,337
you're up.

2867
03:36:05,337 --> 03:36:13,487
MARISHA: Okay. Since he's floating, I'm going to
go, (growls) and go for the spiritual guardian.

2868
03:36:13,487 --> 03:36:18,827
Ooh, the first one is a 21.

2869
03:36:18,827 --> 03:36:20,158
MATT: That hits.

2870
03:36:20,158 --> 03:36:21,387
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. 22.

2871
03:36:21,387 --> 03:36:22,700
MATT: Is this a pounce?

2872
03:36:22,700 --> 03:36:25,024
MARISHA: Can it be a pounce? Was I far enough
away?

2873
03:36:25,024 --> 03:36:27,184
MATT: If you move back and then pounce, you
could.

2874
03:36:27,184 --> 03:36:29,396
MARISHA: Then fuck yeah, it's a pounce.

2875
03:36:29,396 --> 03:36:36,803
MATT: You have the movement to do so. So you back
up, (growls) leap, and pounce on the shield

2876
03:36:36,803 --> 03:36:37,750
guardian.

2877
03:36:37,750 --> 03:36:41,398
MARISHA: So does he succeed his strength saving
throw, DC 14?

2878
03:36:41,398 --> 03:36:43,064
MATT: Nope! Not with a three.

2879
03:36:43,064 --> 03:36:44,901
MARISHA: Then he is knocked prone.

2880
03:36:44,901 --> 03:36:46,789
MATT: (impact noise) Slow and prone.

2881
03:36:46,789 --> 03:36:59,344
MARISHA: And then I make a bite attack, which is a
19. Ooh, that's not good, in terms of damage.

2882
03:36:59,344 --> 03:37:00,389
Seven damage.

2883
03:37:00,389 --> 03:37:06,536
MATT: Seven damage. All righty. So as you jump on
it, you force it to the ground. You see the thing

2884
03:37:06,536 --> 03:37:10,460
topple towards you, and you have to step back to
avoid it, Thorbir. It crashes into the ground, and

2885
03:37:10,460 --> 03:37:15,345
now Minxie, the white saber-toothed tiger, is on
top of it, and starts biting and clawing at it,

2886
03:37:15,345 --> 03:37:20,040
dealing a bunch of damage to the front of its
armor. Very cool. That ends Keyleth's turn.

2887
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:34,191
Tiberius, you're up. Strangely enough, none of
this makes any sound. It's a silent battle. It is

2888
03:37:34,191 --> 03:37:37,446
the creepiest, quietest fight over here right
now.

2889
03:37:37,446 --> 03:37:56,033
ORION: I'm going to cast Obelisk of Stone.
Rakshasa! The butthole. And smash the shit out of

2890
03:37:56,033 --> 03:37:59,938
both of them! 20 feet high. Maximum height.

2891
03:37:59,938 --> 03:38:12,242
MATT: Okay. I'm looking up the spell real fast.

2892
03:38:12,242 --> 03:38:16,064
MARISHA: Dex save.

2893
03:38:16,064 --> 03:38:18,497
ORION: It's a dex save.

2894
03:38:18,497 --> 03:38:28,750
MATT: That's a natural 20 for the rakshasa, and
that is a six for the shield guardian.

2895
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:41,790
ORION: So he's pinned to the ceiling, and they
both take 21 damage.

2896
03:38:41,790 --> 03:38:46,299
WILL and MARISHA: (laugh)

2897
03:38:46,299 --> 03:38:53,080
WILL: What's that weird James Gandolfini breathing
next to me? It's really bizarre.

2898
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:57,263
MATT: I'm clarifying this because the spell says
this. They make a dex saving throw, or they're

2899
03:38:57,263 --> 03:39:01,449
lifted by the pillar. If they make a save, they
are not touched by the pillar.

2900
03:39:01,449 --> 03:39:04,999
ORION: Right. That means they don't get pinned by
it.

2901
03:39:04,999 --> 03:39:08,884
MATT: No, they don't take any damage. If they make
their save, they dodge out of the way. That's how

2902
03:39:08,884 --> 03:39:10,182
the spell is designed.

2903
03:39:10,182 --> 03:39:11,528
ORION: All right.

2904
03:39:11,528 --> 03:39:16,892
MATT: It's primarily intended to be a defensive
spell that can occasionally be used offensively,

2905
03:39:16,892 --> 03:39:19,998
if they fail their save. The shield guardian takes
the damage.

2906
03:39:19,998 --> 03:39:21,258
ORION: And he's pinned.

2907
03:39:21,258 --> 03:39:22,840
MATT: And he's pinned, currently. Yep.

2908
03:39:22,840 --> 03:39:26,791
WIL and WILL: Nice move.

2909
03:39:26,791 --> 03:39:33,369
WILL: Get him, Stormchaser.

2910
03:39:33,369 --> 03:39:40,391
MATT: All right. The rakshasa dodges out of the
way, and there is now a giant pillar in the middle

2911
03:39:40,391 --> 03:39:41,409
of the room.

2912
03:39:41,409 --> 03:39:43,295
ORION: I look at him, and I'm like--

2913
03:39:43,295 --> 03:39:49,048
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Tiberius?
Thorbir, you're up.

2914
03:39:49,048 --> 03:39:52,124
WIL: Can I hit the guardian?

2915
03:39:52,124 --> 03:39:56,558
MATT: Currently, it is pinned against the ceiling,
so you cannot hit it.

2916
03:39:56,558 --> 03:39:59,434
WIL: Right, so I can't do anything. Can I just
delay?

2917
03:39:59,434 --> 03:40:03,494
MATT: You can if you want to. You can use your
action to hold off until something triggers, which

2918
03:40:03,494 --> 03:40:06,995
could be moving into range, in case you could then
take your action on it.

2919
03:40:06,995 --> 03:40:11,377
WIL: I'll do that. I can't get the rakshasa.

2920
03:40:11,377 --> 03:40:16,702
MATT: Not from that distance, no. So you'll wait
for this thing to try and find its way out. All

2921
03:40:16,702 --> 03:40:20,242
right, cool. So that brings us to the top: the
rakshasa's turn.

2922
03:40:20,242 --> 03:40:26,093
WIL: Oh, but I am calling out, and yelling at, and
taunting at the guy. And it's just this.

2923
03:40:26,093 --> 03:40:28,064
(mouthing words)

2924
03:40:28,064 --> 03:40:36,425
ORION: Oh, because of the Silence. I'll dissipate
the spell so I can hear him. Were you trying to

2925
03:40:36,425 --> 03:40:37,559
say something, Thorbir?

2926
03:40:37,559 --> 03:40:41,124
WIL: (shouting) And I will be naked and riding
through the desert--

2927
03:40:41,124 --> 03:40:44,837
(laughter)

2928
03:40:44,837 --> 03:40:49,968
MATT: The rakshasa finishes scanning the room for
a second, and he says, "Well, this has been a lot

2929
03:40:49,968 --> 03:40:55,519
"of fun. I appreciate this little scuffle. However,
I have other business to attend to. Looking at the

2930
03:40:55,519 --> 03:41:02,407
"rest of you, at least I know where to hit you all
the hardest. I know you have a father you seek. I

2931
03:41:02,407 --> 03:41:12,078
"know you have family in Draconia. I know you have
a sister that is not too far from here. And you. I

2932
03:41:12,078 --> 03:41:17,897
"know you have one you hold dear to your heart. I
can now see your minds, see their faces, and I

2933
03:41:17,897 --> 03:41:23,256
"will see them soon. However, I must say adieu."
And he begins to cast--

2934
03:41:23,256 --> 03:41:24,963
ORION: 4th-level Counterspell!

2935
03:41:24,963 --> 03:41:26,275
MARISHA: Tiberius!

2936
03:41:26,275 --> 03:41:28,682
MATT: You already used one 4th-level Counterspell
from your ring earlier.

2937
03:41:28,682 --> 03:41:30,876
ORION: Yeah, and I have two stored in there.

2938
03:41:30,876 --> 03:41:34,949
MATT: How do you have two 4th-level Counterspells
in a ring that can carry

2939
03:41:34,949 --> 03:41:37,528
up to four levels of a spell?

2940
03:41:37,528 --> 03:41:45,016
ORION: No. I can carry five up to 4th-level
spells. It's my Ring of Spell Storing. It can

2941
03:41:45,016 --> 03:41:47,552
carry up to five spells that go up to 4th level.

2942
03:41:47,552 --> 03:41:48,915
MARISHA: No, that's not how it works.

2943
03:41:48,915 --> 03:41:50,682
MATT: It can carry up to four levels of spells.

2944
03:41:50,682 --> 03:41:52,412
ORION: I don't understand that.

2945
03:41:52,412 --> 03:41:56,786
LIAM: You can do four level-1 spells. You can do
one level-4 spell. You can do two level-2 spells.

2946
03:41:56,786 --> 03:41:58,473
ORION: That's not how it worked before.

2947
03:41:58,473 --> 03:42:04,904
MARISHA: Yeah. That's how my ring works, as well.
It's a level-5 Ring of Storing.

2948
03:42:04,904 --> 03:42:10,288
MATT: Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons. It's all
good. You have Counterspell as a spell you know,

2949
03:42:10,288 --> 03:42:11,677
though, right?

2950
03:42:11,677 --> 03:42:14,408
ORION: Yeah. Still 4th-level Counterspell.

2951
03:42:14,408 --> 03:42:20,329
MATT: Okay. Good to know. That makes a difference.
Let me double-check one thing real fast, because

2952
03:42:20,329 --> 03:42:22,128
this will make or break the circumstance, really.

2953
03:42:22,128 --> 03:42:29,078
ORION: As a matter of fact, no. 6th-level
Counterspell. (growling) You will go nowhere!

2954
03:42:29,078 --> 03:42:32,825
MATT: All right.

2955
03:42:32,825 --> 03:42:35,805
ORION: That's far as I can go.

2956
03:42:35,805 --> 03:42:37,678
MARISHA: We go to 11.

2957
03:42:37,678 --> 03:42:45,112
MATT: All right. It is a 7th-level spell, so let's
go ahead and roll.

2958
03:42:45,112 --> 03:42:48,706
MARISHA: Come on.

2959
03:42:48,706 --> 03:42:53,507
ORION: Do I have advantage or anything?

2960
03:42:53,507 --> 03:42:55,999
MARISHA: I don't think so.

2961
03:42:55,999 --> 03:42:57,669
MATT: Okay. Don't roll yet.

2962
03:42:57,669 --> 03:42:59,155
ORION: Okay.

2963
03:42:59,155 --> 03:43:07,692
WILL: (laughs) That's awesome. Okay. He's in
charge!

2964
03:43:07,692 --> 03:43:16,130
MATT: Okay, so roll a d20 and your spell-casting
ability is five for this.

2965
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:18,234
LIAM: Don't piss off Tetsuo, man.

2966
03:43:18,234 --> 03:43:23,710
MATT: So you roll a d20. Add a five. I will say
you have advantage on this because you were

2967
03:43:23,710 --> 03:43:28,529
expecting and waiting for this, so go ahead and
make your first roll. Roll one at a time.

2968
03:43:28,529 --> 03:43:30,726
MARISHA: Okay.

2969
03:43:30,726 --> 03:43:32,280
ORION: 19.

2970
03:43:32,280 --> 03:43:33,774
MATT: 19? All right.

2971
03:43:33,774 --> 03:43:37,048
MARISHA: Oh, take that 19.

2972
03:43:37,097 --> 03:43:38,185
ORION: 19.

2973
03:43:38,185 --> 03:43:43,779
MATT: 19? All right. To counter this spell as a
level seven, you needed to roll a 17 or higher.

2974
03:43:43,779 --> 03:43:54,611
You are targeting the spell, not the rakshasa
itself. As you can see, its form begins to

2975
03:43:54,611 --> 03:44:00,649
shimmer, and you see a small gate begin to open
around its form. You, as a reaction, reach up and

2976
03:44:00,649 --> 03:44:05,224
unleash your torrent of countering arcane energy.
It hits this opening gate. The gate then

2977
03:44:05,224 --> 03:44:10,203
fluctuates and shuts. At which point, the rakshasa
goes, (quiet growl) and for the first time,

2978
03:44:10,203 --> 03:44:13,882
really, in this entire battle, looks genuinely
scared.

2979
03:44:13,882 --> 03:44:14,737
WILL: Yeah!

2980
03:44:14,737 --> 03:44:15,891
MARISHA: Fucking kill it!

2981
03:44:15,891 --> 03:44:17,937
LIAM: You were saying something about my sister?

2982
03:44:17,937 --> 03:44:20,858
ORION: (shouting) No one threatens a goddamn
Stormwind!

2983
03:44:20,858 --> 03:44:22,652
WILL: What he said.

2984
03:44:22,652 --> 03:44:25,995
ORION: I think I just broke my hand.

2985
03:44:25,995 --> 03:44:27,790
(laughter)

2986
03:44:27,790 --> 03:44:36,951
MATT: Don't break your hand! It's going to fly--
actually, it's going to fly toward the door.

2987
03:44:36,951 --> 03:44:39,045
WILL: Towards the door?

2988
03:44:39,045 --> 03:44:42,890
MATT: Yeah. That's all the movement it can get,
there, but it is heading towards the exit.

2989
03:44:42,890 --> 03:44:44,587
MARISHA: Oh, he's fucking trying to leave!

2990
03:44:44,587 --> 03:44:48,282
LIAM: He suddenly turns pink and says,
(Snagglepuss impression) exit stage right, even!

2991
03:44:48,282 --> 03:44:50,518
(laughter)

2992
03:44:50,518 --> 03:44:56,389
MATT: He's gliding toward the doorway over everybody.
That brings us to Vax's turn.

2993
03:44:56,389 --> 03:44:59,976
WILL: Come on, Vax! Don't let this bitch leave!

2994
03:44:59,976 --> 03:45:06,477
LIAM: How far is he from that statue?

2995
03:45:06,477 --> 03:45:11,643
MATT: From this statue here? At that height, I'd
say it's about 30 feet.

2996
03:45:11,643 --> 03:45:20,585
LIAM: 30 feet? Okay. He's not paying attention to
me. Can I use my bonus action to go stealth?

2997
03:45:20,585 --> 03:45:25,070
MATT: You're partially obscured by the statue. I'd
say you can do that.

2998
03:45:25,070 --> 03:45:34,996
LIAM: All right. With advantage. Come on, you
fucking motherfucker. That is 28. And I'm throwing

2999
03:45:34,996 --> 03:45:46,021
daggers at the back of his head. Yes. That is a
27. Do we call that sneak attack?

3000
03:45:46,021 --> 03:45:51,883
MATT: He did not see you stealth, actually. He did
not roll high enough perception, so you have sneak

3001
03:45:51,883 --> 03:45:53,264
attack on him.

3002
03:45:53,264 --> 03:46:01,482
MARISHA: Ugh, I'm out of alcohol. It's the worst
time to be out.

3003
03:46:01,482 --> 03:46:05,622
WIL: Druid needs booze badly.

3004
03:46:05,622 --> 03:46:06,718
LIAM: 30.

3005
03:46:06,718 --> 03:46:11,470
MATT: 30 damage?

3006
03:46:11,470 --> 03:46:13,325
How do you want to do this?

3007
03:46:13,325 --> 03:46:19,766
(cheering)

3008
03:46:19,766 --> 03:46:23,615
LIAM: I've got the dagger in my hand, right? I see
him flying away. I'm crouched down. I flip it over

3009
03:46:23,615 --> 03:46:28,788
so the blade's in my hand. I don't go fast. I just
take my time, pull back, throw it harder than I

3010
03:46:28,788 --> 03:46:34,703
usually do, through its neck, out the front.

3011
03:46:34,703 --> 03:46:42,363
MATT: The dagger hits it in the back of the neck
and the spine. It doesn't quite cut through the

3012
03:46:42,363 --> 03:46:46,737
spinal column. You see it comes out the front of
the throat. (choking noise) The spell falters.

3013
03:46:46,737 --> 03:46:54,241
(thud) It falls to the ground, taking a serious
impact fall and is now, (grunts) dragging itself

3014
03:46:54,241 --> 03:47:03,343
towards the exit of the room as you start walking
up to collect your blade. (coughing, gasping) It

3015
03:47:03,343 --> 03:47:07,483
brings up its hand to start trying to cast a
spell. (wet choking sound) It coughs this big pool

3016
03:47:07,483 --> 03:47:09,147
of blood onto the ground.

3017
03:47:09,147 --> 03:47:15,142
LIAM: I grab it by the ear and lift its head back.
You talk about my sister again.

3018
03:47:15,142 --> 03:47:21,374
MATT: (death rattle) With a spray of crimson
across the ground and this horrible sucking sound,

3019
03:47:21,374 --> 03:47:27,723
you pull back the head as the life force of the
rakshasa comes spraying across the stone floor. As

3020
03:47:27,723 --> 03:47:34,718
you release it and leave it to the ground with the
last bit of life left in its body leaves its form,

3021
03:47:34,718 --> 03:47:41,272
you hear this chuckle. "I'll find you."

3022
03:47:41,272 --> 03:47:43,193
LIAM: And I boot it into the acid.

3023
03:47:43,193 --> 03:47:45,596
WILL: No, we need the eyes!

3024
03:47:45,596 --> 03:47:53,030
MATT: (laughs) The body tumbles into the acid.
(sizzling sound) You guys run over really quickly

3025
03:47:53,030 --> 03:47:55,287
and pull it out.

3026
03:47:55,287 --> 03:47:57,403
WILL: What were you thinking?! (laughs)

3027
03:47:57,403 --> 03:48:01,446
LIAM: Don't push my buttons, man.

3028
03:48:01,446 --> 03:48:07,388
WIL: Has the animation gone out of the guardian?

3029
03:48:07,388 --> 03:48:10,702
MATT: The shield guardian that was currently
struggling has gone limp,

3030
03:48:10,702 --> 03:48:12,333
pinned against the ceiling.

3031
03:48:12,333 --> 03:48:15,712
WILL: Nice work.

3032
03:48:15,712 --> 03:48:23,322
MARISHA: Okay. I go over to it, and I bust out my
book, and I start harvesting all the parts we

3033
03:48:23,322 --> 03:48:30,334
need. Who's got the contract? What all do we
need?

3034
03:48:30,334 --> 03:48:33,798
WILL: Who has it? I don't have the contract.

3035
03:48:33,798 --> 03:48:35,446
LIAM: I never touched it.

3036
03:48:35,446 --> 03:48:38,456
WILL: We need the eyes. I didn't have the
contract.

3037
03:48:38,456 --> 03:48:39,581
WIL: You had the contract.

3038
03:48:39,581 --> 03:48:41,004
WILL: I did not. You were in charge.

3039
03:48:41,004 --> 03:48:47,740
WIL: I was not in charge. I was never in charge. I
was sent here to be a babysitter.

3040
03:48:47,740 --> 03:48:50,239
WILL: That's in charge, as far as I'm concerned.

3041
03:48:50,239 --> 03:48:53,337
MATT: Does nobody have the contract?

3042
03:48:53,337 --> 03:48:55,786
ORION: Is it behind us?

3043
03:48:55,786 --> 03:48:56,916
LIAM: Oh, come on.

3044
03:48:56,916 --> 03:49:03,089
MARISHA: We signed it, after, and left it
somewhere.

3045
03:49:03,089 --> 03:49:04,947
MATT: It might have ended up in the storage.

3046
03:49:04,947 --> 03:49:06,314
LIAM: Oh, the actual, physical--

3047
03:49:06,314 --> 03:49:08,096
MATT: The actual, physical contract.

3048
03:49:08,096 --> 03:49:10,401
MARISHA: Might have ended up in storage.

3049
03:49:10,401 --> 03:49:12,271
WIL: Someone from production made us sign it.

3050
03:49:12,271 --> 03:49:15,432
LIAM: Here it is, clearly, right here.

3051
03:49:15,432 --> 03:49:17,504
MARISHA: The fangs and the tongue.

3052
03:49:17,504 --> 03:49:19,225
WILL: Ah, yes!

3053
03:49:19,225 --> 03:49:20,579
MARISHA: We found it!

3054
03:49:20,579 --> 03:49:22,847
MATT: That would have been a real shame to get all
this far.

3055
03:49:22,847 --> 03:49:28,120
MARISHA: I got it. Cool.

3056
03:49:28,120 --> 03:49:32,274
WILL: We got it. It's all good. What do we need?

3057
03:49:32,274 --> 03:49:33,739
LIAM: We're fine here. Everything's fine.

3058
03:49:33,739 --> 03:49:36,289
WIL, LIAM, and WILL: How are you?

3059
03:49:36,289 --> 03:49:43,241
MARISHA: Okay, I have my book, which I think gives
me advantage, I think is how it works?

3060
03:49:43,241 --> 03:49:45,155
MATT: Gives you advantage on those, yeah.

3061
03:49:45,155 --> 03:49:50,657
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, gives me advantage. So I have
to do this individually for each one, correct?

3062
03:49:50,657 --> 03:49:56,109
MATT: Correct. Roll two at a time to make it more
expedient.

3063
03:49:56,109 --> 03:50:05,250
MARISHA: Two at a time? Okay, first for the eyes
and tongue. Ooh, I'll take that 18 and 20.

3064
03:50:05,250 --> 03:50:06,980
Natural 20.

3065
03:50:06,980 --> 03:50:10,851
MATT: Well, it's with advantage, so the first
roll's a 20. That's for the eyes?

3066
03:50:10,851 --> 03:50:12,373
MARISHA: That's for the eyes.

3067
03:50:12,373 --> 03:50:14,703
MATT: Without a problem, pop both eyes out.

3068
03:50:14,703 --> 03:50:20,534
MARISHA: Tongue. I'll also take that natural 20.

3069
03:50:20,534 --> 03:50:24,457
MATT: There is a purpose you serve.

3070
03:50:24,457 --> 03:50:26,677
WILL: And it's the balance on the sides of the
room.

3071
03:50:26,677 --> 03:50:28,035
MARISHA: I'll take that.

3072
03:50:28,035 --> 03:50:29,651
WIL: I am good for something.

3073
03:50:29,651 --> 03:50:36,503
MARISHA: And for the heart. That's 16 total.

3074
03:50:36,503 --> 03:50:43,959
MATT: 16? All right. With some difficulty, you
manage to eventually tear the heart out of the

3075
03:50:43,959 --> 03:50:50,886
chest cavity. It's a very nasty process, and most
of you guys-- well, not so much you guys; you've

3076
03:50:50,886 --> 03:50:56,141
seen a lot of crimson, but watching this little
druid girl, seemingly unfazed by the process of

3077
03:50:56,141 --> 03:50:59,631
tearing into the chest of this rakshasa, is very
disconcerting.

3078
03:50:59,631 --> 03:51:01,911
LIAM: Come on, Mononoke.

3079
03:51:01,911 --> 03:51:04,855
MARISHA: Here, hold this.

3080
03:51:04,855 --> 03:51:10,204
MATT: And it is this dark, dull red, like
overcooked meat.

3081
03:51:10,204 --> 03:51:24,017
MARISHA: Okay. The claws. Oh, I'll take that 19!
30. Oh, sorry. 29.

3082
03:51:24,017 --> 03:51:31,109
MATT: You take each one of the hands of the
rakshasa, the back-turned, strange, upside-down

3083
03:51:31,109 --> 03:51:35,908
humanoid hands, and cut them off at the wrists,
very cleanly, and both are

3084
03:51:35,908 --> 03:51:37,343
harvested without issue.

3085
03:51:37,343 --> 03:51:43,696
MARISHA: And the canine teeth. I'll take that 15
for 25.

3086
03:51:43,696 --> 03:51:44,862
MATT: 25 total?

3087
03:51:44,862 --> 03:51:45,835
MARISHA: Total.

3088
03:51:45,835 --> 03:51:53,794
MATT: You take the rest of the head. You can see
this terrible grin, this perpetually pulled smile

3089
03:51:53,794 --> 03:52:01,739
from its final moments. You manage to pull out,
very cleanly, both of the canines from the inside

3090
03:52:01,739 --> 03:52:02,979
of the mouth.

3091
03:52:02,979 --> 03:52:08,367
MARISHA: Tiberius? Do you have any vials left
over? Empty vials?

3092
03:52:08,367 --> 03:52:09,695
ORION: Yes, of course.

3093
03:52:09,695 --> 03:52:12,538
MARISHA: Can I try and harvest some of the blood,
as well, to keep for personal use?

3094
03:52:12,538 --> 03:52:13,899
ORION: That's exactly what I was going to do.

3095
03:52:13,899 --> 03:52:15,509
WILL: (gags) For the love of-- (gags)

3096
03:52:15,509 --> 03:52:17,935
ORION: I'm taking some of the blood, for sure.
Filling some vials.

3097
03:52:17,935 --> 03:52:20,914
MARISHA: Are you squeamish about blood, Kashaw?

3098
03:52:20,914 --> 03:52:22,430
WILL: I'm a healer!

3099
03:52:22,430 --> 03:52:29,444
MATT: It's a little difficult, since a rather
large portion of the rakshasa's blood is currently

3100
03:52:29,444 --> 03:52:35,483
spattered across the floor, thanks to Vax. You
manage to harvest one vial of its blood.

3101
03:52:35,483 --> 03:52:37,445
MARISHA: One vial?

3102
03:52:37,445 --> 03:52:38,818
MATT: One vial.

3103
03:52:38,818 --> 03:52:45,035
ORION: I'm going to take my dagger out, and I'm
going to shave trimmings from his fur and his

3104
03:52:45,035 --> 03:52:46,650
whiskers. I'll take those.

3105
03:52:46,650 --> 03:52:51,332
MATT: You currently have a vial of rakshasa
shave scum.

3106
03:52:51,332 --> 03:52:57,090
WILL: Thorbir, you want the taint? There's tons of
magic in it.

3107
03:52:57,090 --> 03:53:01,689
(laughter)

3108
03:53:01,689 --> 03:53:16,115
WIL: I take the jeweled dagger, and I walk down to
the corpse of the rakshasa. I drive the dagger

3109
03:53:16,115 --> 03:53:26,088
through one of the eye sockets, and I say, you
will never harm my daughter.

3110
03:53:26,088 --> 03:53:33,888
MATT: The dagger is left there as a proclaiment,
and all of you feel the weight behind that

3111
03:53:33,888 --> 03:53:37,464
whispered statement and decide it might be best to
leave that dagger where it sits.

3112
03:53:37,464 --> 03:53:42,233
WIL: Let us conclude our business.

3113
03:53:42,233 --> 03:53:43,964
ORION: Very good.

3114
03:53:43,964 --> 03:53:46,756
MATT: As you've completed the harvesting, you
notice the contract, the sigils that currently

3115
03:53:46,756 --> 03:53:54,513
lock it, flash and seem to vanish from the paper,
your contract completed. For the sake of brevity,

3116
03:53:54,513 --> 03:54:01,636
you all manage to make your way-- arduously and
with much difficulty-- not through the Amaranthine

3117
03:54:01,636 --> 03:54:05,277
Oubliette, because that would be difficult, but
retracing your steps back through a tunnel which

3118
03:54:05,277 --> 03:54:07,530
has been sealed shut by iron pillars.

3119
03:54:07,530 --> 03:54:13,620
ORION: We have to break through those first.
Fireball, fireball, fireball. Breaky, breaky,

3120
03:54:13,620 --> 03:54:14,459
breaky.

3121
03:54:14,459 --> 03:54:19,590
MATT: That's a terrible idea. Creating explosions
in small, enclosed, earthen tunnels is a really

3122
03:54:19,590 --> 03:54:20,721
good idea.

3123
03:54:20,721 --> 03:54:22,339
WILL: (laughs) No problem.

3124
03:54:22,339 --> 03:54:25,391
MATT: They completed the contract, but then all
suffocated due to a sudden cave-in. It was so

3125
03:54:25,391 --> 03:54:27,220
unfortunate, the second team.

3126
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:28,984
ORION: I had a bottle of air!

3127
03:54:28,984 --> 03:54:38,091
MATT: Everyone's just permanently breathing air.
It is the worst fate ever for a PC.

3128
03:54:38,091 --> 03:54:40,365
LIAM: Gather around. Watch what I can do!

3129
03:54:40,365 --> 03:54:42,370
(laughter)

3130
03:54:42,370 --> 03:54:46,930
MATT: It takes you a long time to retrace your
steps and find your way through the entrapment,

3131
03:54:46,930 --> 03:54:51,627
especially since as you remove the iron pillars,
the boulder then begins to roll past, so you carve

3132
03:54:51,627 --> 03:54:59,486
your way through. You make your way precariously
back to the Velvet Cabaret, back into the room

3133
03:54:59,486 --> 03:55:08,842
where the rakshasa once lived. Do you wish to walk
into the center of the Velvet Cabaret, covered in

3134
03:55:08,842 --> 03:55:10,543
various fluids?

3135
03:55:10,543 --> 03:55:12,073
WIL: Fuck yes, we do.

3136
03:55:12,073 --> 03:55:13,281
WILL: Yeah, I think absolutely.

3137
03:55:13,281 --> 03:55:16,824
MATT: All right. (boof) The door slams open and
you all step into the center of the Velvet

3138
03:55:16,824 --> 03:55:23,114
Cabaret. As you do, two of the guards turn and see
you exit. "Hey! Hey, wait! What are you doing?"

3139
03:55:23,114 --> 03:55:24,985
And they go for their blades to the side.

3140
03:55:24,985 --> 03:55:26,397
WILL: Seriously?

3141
03:55:26,397 --> 03:55:33,461
ORION: I turn around and go like, you really don't
want to do that, friend. Trust me, please.

3142
03:55:33,461 --> 03:55:35,815
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3143
03:55:35,815 --> 03:55:41,681
ORION: Oh, what is that? 14.

3144
03:55:41,681 --> 03:55:48,776
MATT: 14? He rolled a three. He looks to the other
guy. "As long as you're leaving."

3145
03:55:48,776 --> 03:55:51,640
ORION: (garbled) Draconian again.

3146
03:55:51,640 --> 03:55:53,775
(laughter)

3147
03:55:53,775 --> 03:55:55,565
WIL: Thorbir just keeps walking.

3148
03:55:55,565 --> 03:55:58,374
MATT: He sheathes the sword, and they give a wide
berth. You can hear the music playing, and

3149
03:55:58,374 --> 03:56:02,300
everyone's laughing. As you enter the room, the
music comes to a stop.

3150
03:56:02,300 --> 03:56:11,483
MARISHA: Right before we leave, I turn and have a
piece of pelt from the rakshasa, and I throw it at

3151
03:56:11,483 --> 03:56:16,363
the guard's feet, and I say, here. That's what's
left of your boss.

3152
03:56:16,363 --> 03:56:23,336
MATT: He steps back for a second. Some of the
other patrons are watching this. Some look scared;

3153
03:56:23,336 --> 03:56:28,398
some look intrigued by this whole sudden arrival
of strange warriors covered in various ichor.

3154
03:56:28,398 --> 03:56:34,431
Watching as you step out, a swarm of them look at
the feet, and one of them goes, "Oh! They killed

3155
03:56:34,431 --> 03:56:37,317
"some sort of tiger!" That's not an accent.

3156
03:56:37,317 --> 03:56:40,945
(laughter)

3157
03:56:40,945 --> 03:56:46,985
MATT: Another who's watching says, "They bought
that down at the market." The guards take it and

3158
03:56:46,985 --> 03:56:53,536
lift it up with the blade and look strangely, and
you see, coming out of the far corner, the bashful

3159
03:56:53,536 --> 03:56:58,252
owner of the establishment that you had previously
knocked unconscious, looks out. Not wanting to

3160
03:56:58,252 --> 03:57:03,023
engage, just watching you as you leave with a look
of fear on his face. You step out onto the

3161
03:57:03,023 --> 03:57:07,740
thoroughfare, close the door behind you, back into
the Quad Roads district, making your way towards

3162
03:57:07,740 --> 03:57:09,625
the Slayer's Take guildhall.

3163
03:57:09,625 --> 03:57:16,159
LIAM: On the way out, I grab two glasses of ale,
and I hand one to this guy and just walk and don't

3164
03:57:16,159 --> 03:57:17,735
say shit.

3165
03:57:17,735 --> 03:57:19,308
MATT: No one argues.

3166
03:57:19,308 --> 03:57:23,325
WIL: Thorbir is genuinely touched by this
gesture.

3167
03:57:23,325 --> 03:57:30,388
MATT: As you sip, you make your way through
the main thoroughfare back to the center of the

3168
03:57:30,388 --> 03:57:36,107
Quad Roads to the Slayer's Take guildhall. You
step inside, and there across the way, in

3169
03:57:36,107 --> 03:57:43,657
mid-conversation with his wife, is Mertin, talking
to the Huntmaster, Vanessa. As you enter, they

3170
03:57:43,657 --> 03:57:47,101
both turn with a look of excited surprise.

3171
03:57:47,101 --> 03:57:52,267
"I assume that this means the contract 
went well, right?"

3172
03:57:52,267 --> 03:57:54,236
WIL: It's done.

3173
03:57:54,236 --> 03:58:00,778
MARISHA: I take a canvas bag and I plop it on the
table, full of the rakshasa bits.

3174
03:58:00,778 --> 03:58:10,124
MATT: (excited chuckles) He shows it to the
Huntmaster. She glances down with a smile. "Very

3175
03:58:10,124 --> 03:58:15,694
"good. I am glad that we gave you such a trusted
member as your overseer. You did well, Thorbir.

3176
03:58:15,694 --> 03:58:21,170
"Thank you for your effort in keeping these
fledglings alive."

3177
03:58:21,170 --> 03:58:25,040
ORION: One more insult, madam, and you will find
your whole establishment on fire.

3178
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:26,271
MARISHA: Tiberius.

3179
03:58:26,271 --> 03:58:27,633
ORION: I'm not in the mood.

3180
03:58:27,633 --> 03:58:32,666
MATT: "It's not meant as an insult. I'm sorry,
perhaps you do not understand that we speak with

3181
03:58:32,666 --> 03:58:34,145
"terms of endearment."

3182
03:58:34,145 --> 03:58:36,459
ORION: Oh. Well, in that case, I take it as a
compliment.

3183
03:58:36,459 --> 03:58:46,542
MATT: "Very well. So, looking at the contract. Is
everything hopefully in order?" She takes it from

3184
03:58:46,542 --> 03:58:54,576
you, looks into the contents of the bag. "Very
well. You shall be paid out in full and scattered

3185
03:58:54,576 --> 03:58:56,513
"amongst your party as you see fit."

3186
03:58:56,513 --> 03:59:03,118
MARISHA: And our counterparts? The rest of our
party, have they returned?

3187
03:59:03,118 --> 03:59:04,505
Have they checked in yet?

3188
03:59:04,505 --> 03:59:09,470
MATT: "Not yet. They are still out at the moment.
They've been gone for about as long as you have

3189
03:59:09,470 --> 03:59:15,275
"been. You've returned faster than they have. Let
us hope that they are safe. But I have faith. They

3190
03:59:15,275 --> 03:59:23,163
"seemed very intent on completing this without
issue, so I would not be too worried. I will

3191
03:59:23,163 --> 03:59:25,169
"notify you upon their return, though."

3192
03:59:25,169 --> 03:59:26,239
MARISHA: Please do.

3193
03:59:26,239 --> 03:59:28,403
MATT: "Where are you staying?"

3194
03:59:28,403 --> 03:59:30,888
MARISHA: Where are we staying?

3195
03:59:30,888 --> 03:59:33,169
WILL: I thought as members of the Take, you got to
stay here?

3196
03:59:33,169 --> 03:59:38,845
MATT: "You could, if you like. We have room, and
technically, as of this contract, you are all

3197
03:59:38,845 --> 03:59:41,649
"officially members of the Take. You may stay here,
if you wish."

3198
03:59:41,649 --> 03:59:46,086
ORION: I need a bed. And I motion towards the
thing. I'm sleepy.

3199
03:59:46,086 --> 03:59:47,393
MARISHA: We'll wait here.

3200
03:59:47,393 --> 03:59:51,955
MATT: "Very well. We shall hold off the ceremony
for when the rest of your team arrives."

3201
03:59:51,955 --> 03:59:58,377
WIL: If the rest of this team is half as good as
these members, the Take has grown much stronger

3202
03:59:58,377 --> 04:00:02,791
this day. They're worthy.

3203
04:00:02,791 --> 04:00:08,398
MATT: She crosses her arms and her usual jovial,
passive attitude grows a little more stern. She

3204
04:00:08,398 --> 04:00:16,743
gives a nod of genuine respect towards Thorbir.
And for the first time she looks about the rest of

3205
04:00:16,743 --> 04:00:27,387
you with a slightly intense look of really
understanding the essence of strength between and

3206
04:00:27,387 --> 04:00:36,555
behind each of you. "I believe you're correct. I
think there will be great things ahead for us.

3207
04:00:36,555 --> 04:00:43,242
"Welcome to the Slayer's Take." She reaches down,
brings up a small wooden chest. Sets it on the

3208
04:00:43,242 --> 04:00:49,353
edge and opens it. On the inside, you can see it
is rather abundant in gold and platinum, of which

3209
04:00:49,353 --> 04:01:06,398
the total comes to-- (counts quietly) 5,100 gold
pieces for this contract.

3210
04:01:06,398 --> 04:01:10,642
That is 1,020 gold each.

3211
04:01:10,642 --> 04:01:12,706
MARISHA: 1,020 gold?

3212
04:01:12,706 --> 04:01:13,816
MATT: Correct.

3213
04:01:13,816 --> 04:01:23,981
WILL: You can split up my take amongst them. I
take it my obligation has been fulfilled?

3214
04:01:23,981 --> 04:01:26,043
MATT: "It has."

3215
04:01:26,043 --> 04:01:28,384
WILL: You know I have no desire to stay.

3216
04:01:28,384 --> 04:01:34,799
MATT: "If you insist. But you know that whenever
you come back to our little humble abode, you

3217
04:01:34,799 --> 04:01:39,334
"always have a place to stay and work at your
disposal, Brother Kash."

3218
04:01:39,334 --> 04:01:46,870
WILL: Thank you. He turns and looks at the rest of
his party. Well. It's certainly been interesting.

3219
04:01:46,870 --> 04:01:52,187
ORION: It has been a pleasure and an honor,
Kashaw. You as well, Thorbir. You are brave

3220
04:01:52,187 --> 04:01:54,692
warriors and would do well in the Draconian
Knights.

3221
04:01:54,692 --> 04:01:57,495
WILL: Thank you, Stormwind.

3222
04:01:57,495 --> 04:02:02,596
ORION: He said my name right!

3223
04:02:02,596 --> 04:02:08,422
WILL: And you. You might be the most annoying
person I've ever met in my life. With that, he

3224
04:02:08,422 --> 04:02:11,294
grabs her around the waist, pulls her in, and
plants one right on her.

3225
04:02:11,294 --> 04:02:17,697
(laughter)

3226
04:02:17,697 --> 04:02:23,894
WILL: Turns, winks, and walks out of the room.

3227
04:02:23,894 --> 04:02:29,065
WIL: Thorbir sighs heavily and is annoyed.

3228
04:02:29,065 --> 04:02:36,590
MATT: "Very well. Welcome to the Slayer's Take."
And with that,

3229
04:02:36,590 --> 04:02:38,483
we'll close this evening's session.

3230
04:02:38,483 --> 04:02:41,896
(laughter)

3231
04:02:41,896 --> 04:02:44,302
LIAM: What a button on the night!

3232
04:02:44,302 --> 04:02:47,200
(laughter)

3233
04:02:47,200 --> 04:03:00,216
MATT: Well done, guys. There were a few seriously
clutch moments in those encounters there. You were

3234
04:03:00,216 --> 04:03:09,006
one roll away from losing the contract. Congrats
on that. Guys, well done. Please, round of

3235
04:03:09,006 --> 04:03:11,409
applause for our fantastic guests these past
couple of weeks.

3236
04:03:11,409 --> 04:03:15,701
(cheering)

3237
04:03:15,701 --> 04:03:19,313
MATT: Happy to have you in the player's seat.
You've been an absolute pleasure, man.

3238
04:03:19,313 --> 04:03:24,969
WIL: Thanks very much. Like I said last week, it's
weird. This is out of my comfort zone, to be in

3239
04:03:24,969 --> 04:03:28,469
this place. But yeah, this was really fun.

3240
04:03:28,469 --> 04:03:30,658
MATT: Awesome. Thank you for coming to be a part.

3241
04:03:30,658 --> 04:03:34,174
WIL: Yeah. And I'm glad that you all got to see
that the legends are true.

3242
04:03:34,174 --> 04:03:36,376
ORION: It's mind-boggling.

3243
04:03:36,376 --> 04:03:37,778
MARISHA: It's so insane.

3244
04:03:37,778 --> 04:03:39,386
MATT: Absolutely surreal.

3245
04:03:39,386 --> 04:03:43,595
WIL: People always accuse me of taking it easy on
my players. I really don't.

3246
04:03:43,595 --> 04:03:45,223
(laughter)

3247
04:03:45,223 --> 04:03:50,762
LIAM: Dice aside, great character.

3248
04:03:50,762 --> 04:03:52,620
MARISHA: Keyleth got her first kiss!

3249
04:03:52,620 --> 04:03:54,411
TALIESIN: That was so awesome.

3250
04:03:54,411 --> 04:03:57,093
MATT: And Will Friedle, guys, who had never
played.

3251
04:03:57,093 --> 04:04:02,299
WILL: Oh, yeah. I've never played. This was a ton
of fun.

3252
04:04:02,299 --> 04:04:04,906
TALIESIN: You were amazing.

3253
04:04:04,906 --> 04:04:06,620
MARISHA: So good.

3254
04:04:06,620 --> 04:04:08,595
MATT: You totally gave Keyleth her first kiss.

3255
04:04:08,595 --> 04:04:11,539
(laughter)

3256
04:04:11,539 --> 04:04:15,474
WILL: And then vanish like a thief in the night!

3257
04:04:15,474 --> 04:04:19,791
MARISHA: Moments that Keyleth has dreamed of.

3258
04:04:19,791 --> 04:04:26,798
MATT: Damn, guys. All right, so we have our
donation list for the evening.

3259
04:04:26,798 --> 04:04:28,772
ZAC: Lots of donations tonight.

3260
04:04:28,772 --> 04:04:32,456
ORION: And our warlock.

3261
04:04:32,456 --> 04:04:34,977
(cheering)

3262
04:04:34,977 --> 04:04:38,457
MARISHA: We fucking lived!

3263
04:04:38,457 --> 04:04:39,983
MARY: How was the kiss?

3264
04:04:39,983 --> 04:04:45,907
MARISHA: Oh my god. I got pink in the face. In
real life.

3265
04:04:45,907 --> 04:04:48,319
TALIESIN: You two totally made out on graph
paper.

3266
04:04:48,319 --> 04:04:49,615
MARY: You did!

3267
04:04:49,615 --> 04:04:51,550
WILL: I want to see that artwork.

3268
04:04:51,550 --> 04:04:56,871
TALIESIN: Oh, it's coming. I heard the sound of
300 pencils going.

3269
04:04:56,871 --> 04:05:02,915
MARISHA: I have a cowboy who just rode into the
sunset, you guys.

3270
04:05:02,915 --> 04:05:05,668
TALIESIN: Ship. He just shipped all over.

3271
04:05:05,668 --> 04:05:07,458
MATT: Darin, get in here!

3272
04:05:07,458 --> 04:05:10,502
LIAM: Kash money!

3273
04:05:10,502 --> 04:05:13,715
(laughter)

3274
04:05:13,715 --> 04:05:16,346
WILL: I know what you've got to do to get invited
back.

3275
04:05:16,346 --> 04:05:21,025
MATT: Also, guys, this is a friend of the show.
Darin, another amazing voice actor who's a fan of

3276
04:05:21,025 --> 04:05:22,178
the show.

3277
04:05:22,178 --> 04:05:24,151
(cheering)

3278
04:05:24,151 --> 04:05:26,949
MATT: For all you Warcraft players, you've
probably killed him as Blackhand in

3279
04:05:26,949 --> 04:05:28,335
Warlords of Draenor.

3280
04:05:28,335 --> 04:05:29,912
DARIN: How dare you?!

3281
04:05:29,912 --> 04:05:32,093
(laughter)

3282
04:05:32,093 --> 04:05:37,145
MATT: And so many other great characters. I'm so
glad he could come and watch tonight.

3283
04:05:37,145 --> 04:44:19,471
