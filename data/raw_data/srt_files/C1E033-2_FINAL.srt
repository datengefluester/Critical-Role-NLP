1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
MATT: Instead of using the table, though, you use
Grog's knee. You just run, jump onto his knee with

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,959
one foot, leap off, blade in the air, go for the
strike.

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:06,891
MARISHA: That's cool!

4
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:10,394
LAURA: You can do it, Scanlan! (laughs)

5
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,593
SAM: What do I add?

6
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:12,543
MARISHA: Your attack bonus.

7
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:13,706
MATT: Attack bonus for your weapon.

8
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:14,606
SAM: I don't know what that is!

9
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,293
(laughter)

10
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:17,495
TRAVIS: It is never used.

11
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:18,958
SAM: Okay. It's a plus seven!

12
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,959
MATT: Yeah, so?

13
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:20,805
SAM: 15.

14
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:21,902
(laughter)

15
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:24,961
MATT: As you rush in the air, you hesitate for a
moment, remembering the Pike thing, and you see

16
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,056
this burning arcane rage in the face of this
entity. At that moment, that hesitation was all it

17
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:34,038
needed. It takes the shield and almost knocks the
weapon out of your hand. You catch yourself, land

18
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:41,343
on your feet-- yeah, your fingers sting a little
bit. (laughs) Worth a shot. All right, in

19
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:46,482
retribution, it's going to strike at you twice.
That's a 15?

20
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,519
SAM: That fails.

21
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:49,650
MATT: 21.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,095
SAM: That is successful.

23
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:52,547
MATT: That is seven points of slashing damage.

24
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:53,547
SAM: Okay.

25
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,968
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

26
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:59,832
MARISHA: Ugh. You guys, I thought someone was
going to kill him!

27
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:03,359
SAM: I tried, but he hurt my wrist really bad!

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,773
MARISHA: I know, because I don't want to fucking
burn any spells on this asshole.

29
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,117
TALIESIN: Just hit him with your stick.

30
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,316
MARISHA: Just-- ugh. God.

31
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,248
MATT: Roll for it.

32
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:17,115
MARISHA: Goddamn it, this hopefully works-- nope.

33
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,277
TALIESIN: No! Wow!

34
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,145
MARISHA: Nope, that didn't work. (tink)

35
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,876
(laughter)

36
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:24,663
MATT: Heavy armor on these guys. All right. Vex,
you're up.

37
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:28,014
LAURA: Oh gosh. I guess I shoot him. Can I see him
to shoot him?

38
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:32,011
MATT: I'll say yeah, you can see him all right.
You can move over there and get a better view a

39
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,143
little bit. Just around this corner, off the
table.

40
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:35,572
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

41
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:36,442
MATT: Hunter's Mark him?

42
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,370
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him.

43
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,758
MATT: Okay, go for it.

44
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:48,784
LAURA: Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking
the 20. No. 19?

45
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:52,852
MATT: 19? The arrow hits the armor and shatters
across the side.

46
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:53,905
LAURA: Shit.

47
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,111
TRAVIS: 19?

48
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,619
LAURA: 24.

49
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,026
MATT: 24 does hit.

50
00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:58,905
LAURA: Okay.

51
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,579
TALIESIN: Yay, you hurt it.

52
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,154
LAURA: Well, maybe.

53
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:05,871
TRAVIS: That's a high AC. Because of the shield,
right?

54
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,909
MATT: Because of the shield and the armor.

55
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:08,853
LAURA: 18.

56
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:13,677
MATT: 18 points of damage? With that, the second
arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor.

57
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:20,486
It hits some sort of core where its arcane form is
held and the reddish energy blinks out, and the armor

58
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:22,500
just (impact noise) crumples to the ground.

59
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,439
TRAVIS: That's two of them!

60
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,114
LAURA: What's up, bitches?

61
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,759
TRAVIS: That was tough.

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,305
MARISHA: Okay, I immediately turn my attention to
Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make

63
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:35,558
sure she's okay?

64
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:37,245
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check, yeah.

65
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,269
TRAVIS: Where's Ripley?

66
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,446
SAM: I start running out the hall to Ripley.

67
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:41,354
TRAVIS: Me, as well.

68
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:43,417
LAURA: Oh, Trinket is still running after her,
too.

69
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:47,863
MATT: All right, make a perception check for
Trinket.

70
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:51,298
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) Okay, is it his smelling?

71
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:53,388
MATT: Yeah, it's his wisdom bonus.

72
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:58,298
LAURA: I'm rolling a big dice for Trinket! Oh,
that's good. 26!

73
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,667
MATT: 26, okay.

74
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,839
LAURA: 25.

75
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:05,072
MATT: 25, okay. Trinket is giving chase best it
can.

76
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:10,382
LAURA: Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage
because he's got advantage on smell perception.

77
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:12,637
Oh, it's the same thing.

78
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:18,383
MATT: Okay, so Trinket is keeping track, but is
having a hard time fully keeping up at this point

79
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:24,745
unless you're giving full attention towards him at
this point in time, but is keeping a track. He is

80
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:28,866
rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is
currently out of your sphere of personal influence

81
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,938
at the moment.

82
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,057
LAURA: I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs)

83
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:35,850
TRAVIS: I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off 
after her out the door.

84
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,804
MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on a medicine check.

85
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:46,943
MATT: Okay, checking Cassandra, there is no sign
of a wound now. She seems to be not in any

86
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,298
danger.

87
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,660
MARISHA: Okay.

88
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,586
MATT: So, she's on the ground, dazed.

89
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:55,896
TALIESIN: I'm going to collapse in a corner for a
minute and start using my ascot to clean some of

90
00:03:55,896 --> 00:04:00,534
the gore off my weapon and my clothing and my
mask.

91
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,424
MATT: It is a lot of gore. Okay.

92
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,096
LIAM: Are we out of combat now?

93
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,313
MATT: You guys are currently out of combat.

94
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:13,437
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to, clutching my bleeding
belly, walk over toward Keyleth and say, that was

95
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:15,499
a close one.

96
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:23,061
MARISHA: Yeah. You know, I feel like we've been
here before-- oh, right. We have been here

97
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:25,113
before.

98
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,862
LIAM: You know I'm in love with you, right? 
And I kiss her.

99
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:29,045
SAM: Oh!

100
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:33,427
TALIESIN: (coughs heavily)

101
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:34,983
SAM: Persistent cough.

102
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,352
MATT: (laughs) And on that note, we're going to go
ahead and take a quick little break!

103
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,015
LAURA: What the fuck?!

104
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:46,344
MATT: (laughs) All right, quick break!

105
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,698
TALIESIN: I want to see what color you turned. Oh
my god, yeah!

106
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:50,318
(laughter)

107
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:53,604
MATT: All right, awesome. Quick break, guys! See
you guys back here in a few minutes.

108
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:55,381
TRAVIS: Dude, what?!

109
00:04:55,381 --> 00:14:02,384
[break]

110
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:06,563
ZAC: Couple quick things, guys, or I could just
sit here and talk for a good ten minutes, make you

111
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:11,699
guys wait before we come back to the bombshell
that was dropped. I'm just going to keep going. We

112
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:16,353
are 15 away from doing a giveaway, if we hit that
15 we will be doing that giveaway at the very end

113
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:21,955
of this stream, right whenever Matt says that's
it. We will open up the chat for everyone and do

114
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:25,062
that giveaway. I also want to say for all the
people wondering what in the world was the No

115
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:30,448
Survivors thing, Snakes on a Plane number one was
this last Monday, and it's up on the website right

116
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:33,525
now if you guys are curious and want to check it
out, it's probably the funniest thing we've ever

117
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:37,861
done on this channel, and I don't say that
lightly. But we're doing Snakes on a Plane 2 this

118
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,960
coming Monday, so thanks, guys.

119
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,774
MATT: Hell yeah.

120
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,717
TALIESIN: Snakes on a Plane 2: More Snakes, More
Plane.

121
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:50,544
MATT: All right. So. With the chaos that has
ensued through the battle in Anders's study in the

122
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:57,840
castle of Whitestone, the party looks about,
Cassandra de Rolo recovered, and pulled from

123
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:06,061
seemingly the brink of death. Vax pulled seemingly
from the brink of death, and Percy managing to

124
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:12,503
squeak in a second killshot on a member of his
list. As the rest period kicks in, Vax stepped

125
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:17,391
across the room, holding his wound to his side,
admitting his affection for Keyleth, and reaching

126
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,816
out and kissing her.

127
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,043
TRAVIS: Or attempting to kiss.

128
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:24,590
LAURA: Roll for contact there?

129
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,885
SAM: Roll for tongue action.

130
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,952
MATT: No.

131
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,128
LIAM: No.

132
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:36,617
MATT: So, as he breaks from the momentary,
unexpected embrace, you catch yourself off guard.

133
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:43,611
LIAM: You know, the way you turn into animals and
stuff is really cool.

134
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,107
TALIESIN: I'm going to collect some of Vex's
arrows.

135
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:49,712
MARISHA: Are you sure you're--

136
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:52,084
LAURA: I leave the room and look for Trinket.

137
00:15:52,084 --> 00:16:04,308
MARISHA: Just... let me. And I Cure Wounds him.
I'll do a 4th level. Shut up, Sam. I just can't

138
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:08,464
find my spell. Yeah, I'll do that 4th-level Cure
Wounds.

139
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:14,053
MATT: Burn all the spell slots. Go ahead and
roll.

140
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,217
LIAM: Folks, we don't know what we're doing. None
of us know what we're doing.

141
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:23,143
MARISHA: I feel like in the moment I would just do
it really at a-- shut up.

142
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,611
SAM: Sure, overcompensate.

143
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:34,896
MARISHA: Right. What do I roll? Hang on. 1d8. So
I'm rolling 4d8. I need d8s, goddamn it!

144
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:35,965
Give me d8s.

145
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,916
TALIESIN: You can't have my d8s.

146
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,403
MARISHA: Why can't I have your d8s?

147
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:41,803
TALIESIN: Okay, fine, have my d8s.

148
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,609
MARISHA: That's fine, give me one more.

149
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,172
MATT: All right.

150
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,908
MARISHA: Okay, 14, 18. (counting)

151
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,210
MATT: What are you doing?

152
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:58,147
TALIESIN: I'm collecting three or four of Vex's
arrows from the ground and getting them in my

153
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:03,255
hand, and I'm staying back from all of this and
letting it happen.

154
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:08,711
MATT: Okay. Collect the arrows, Vex has stepped
out of the room to pursue after Trinket, Trinket

155
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,069
is currently pursuing Ripley. Grog, you watched
that happen.

156
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,798
TRAVIS: No, Grog and Scanlan ran out of the room
after Ripley.

157
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,498
MATT: Okay, have you guys bolted out? Okay.

158
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,948
TRAVIS: We're yelling out, Ripley!

159
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:19,671
SAM: Ripley!

160
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,271
TALIESIN: Vax, are you all right?

161
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,072
SAM: We shouldn't yell, Grog.

162
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,676
TRAVIS: Fuck that. I yell anyway.

163
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,993
LIAM: Was there a total?

164
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:26,970
MARISHA: 33.

165
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,681
LIAM: Yes, I feel better. Thank you.

166
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:36,740
TALIESIN: That's good. I'm going to now take my
handful of what is now basically a switch, and I'm

167
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,521
going to start whacking him with it really hard on
the chest.

168
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:40,701
LIAM: Who?

169
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:45,257
TALIESIN: You! Don't go into rooms by yourself,
god damn it!

170
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:48,733
MARISHA: I back into a corner upon seeing this, as
Percy ruins the moment.

171
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:55,648
LIAM: Percival, he had a knife to your sister's
throat. He was going to kill her.

172
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:59,468
TALIESIN: Thank you, but count to ten. And now I
drop them and go over to my sister.

173
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:03,597
LIAM: I was afraid she was going to die.

174
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:07,006
MARISHA: To be fair, you did get her throat slit,
but it's okay.

175
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:12,585
MATT: As you're saying this, you turn around, you
can see she's sat up and she sees this

176
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:16,446
conversation and goes, "Percy?"

177
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,226
TALIESIN: Hi.

178
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,789
MATT: "Percy!"

179
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,576
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

180
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:26,719
MATT: And she gets up off the ground and runs up
and just grabs you and embraces you tightly. You

181
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:30,070
can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she
just holds you with a slight shake to her body.

182
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,392
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry for leaving you.

183
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:37,652
MATT: "I thought you were dead." She pulls away
for a second and just looks at you, and there's a

184
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:46,078
coldness to her face. She's happy, but even for
her young age, you can see there's lines at the

185
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:55,574
corners of her eyes. She's probably been through a
lot. She smiles and looks up at you again and you

186
00:18:55,574 --> 00:19:00,903
can see there's the white shocks in her hair, and
she looks up and touches your hair and goes, "I see

187
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:04,595
"we've both survived quite a bit."

188
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:05,941
TALIESIN: I wouldn't trade.

189
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:11,797
MATT: She laughs to herself, and you see another
tear curl at her eye, and then her face goes cold

190
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:18,586
for a second and she, not breaking this gaze,
steps back. "You shouldn't be here. They were

191
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,797
"using me to get to you. I'm so sorry."

192
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:24,562
TALIESIN: Are you all right? Did they do anything?
Are you yourself?

193
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:33,977
MATT: She reaches up and holds her neck. "I'm
good. I'm good." And she steels herself for a

194
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:39,028
second, and even more so, you see there's an
intensity to her.

195
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,369
TALIESIN: Perception check?

196
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,444
MATT: To...?

197
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:49,864
TALIESIN: Insight. I want to make sure she's not
holding anything really important back.

198
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:51,473
MATT: Okay, go for it.

199
00:19:51,473 --> 00:20:00,147
TALIESIN: Insight? Do I get a bonus for that right
now? It's a wisdom-- yeah!

200
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:01,825
MATT: No, because you were concentrating.

201
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,268
TALIESIN: This is not a saving throw, though.

202
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,670
MATT: Yeah, and that's wisdom, not a saving
throw.

203
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,605
TALIESIN: 11.

204
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:19,396
MATT: 11. Okay. Best you can tell, she seems very
honest. She seems forthright. You're used to the

205
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:26,402
memory of your sister being this bright-eyed,
cheerful, youngest of the bunch, and definitely a

206
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:35,626
woman who sees the world with fresh eyes. These
eyes are different. They're colder. They're

207
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:44,839
hardened. In ways, you're impressed; in ways,
you're also immediately sad to see that that

208
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,261
memory of your sister probably is no longer
there.

209
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:52,600
TALIESIN: We're putting an end to the Briarwoods
tonight. Before the sun sets. This is the end of

210
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,379
them. It's all going to be over, and we're going
to stop whatever it is they're doing

211
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,244
under the city.

212
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:04,481
MATT: "You say this. We've tried twice."

213
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:08,888
TALIESIN: I know. This is it.

214
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:21,145
MATT: "That's what the others thought. You left
me, you know."

215
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:24,136
TALIESIN: I know, and I'm so sorry.

216
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:32,002
MATT: "Good. Well, if we're going to do this,
let's get ready."

217
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:35,829
TALIESIN: You're going to your room.

218
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,920
MATT: "Yes, I am."

219
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,519
TALIESIN: To wait until this is over.

220
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:47,044
MATT: "No. No, I'm not. I'm going to my room to
get my things. To get my mother's armor."

221
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:54,644
TALIESIN: (sputters) You're-- I don't think that's
a very good idea.

222
00:21:54,644 --> 00:22:00,366
MATT: "You've been fighting them for what, a few
days? I've been fighting them for nearly three

223
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:09,086
"years. You have no power over me, brother. And if
our goals are aligned to free this city, let's do

224
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:12,491
"it together. But I don't have to listen to you."

225
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,631
TALIESIN: God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh!

226
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,249
MATT: She walks out of the room.

227
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,678
MARISHA: Percy!

228
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,938
TALIESIN: She's so obnoxious. What?

229
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:26,472
MARISHA: You have a sister.

230
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:30,381
TALIESIN: Oh god, I do.

231
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:39,289
MATT: You guys, charging off. Trinket's keeping
trail. She's run down the stairway, he is

232
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:49,478
beginning to slowly gain on her. She reaches the
front doors, does remember the caltrops. Jumps

233
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:55,826
over them, grabs the door, opens it, and rushes
out into the daylight. Go ahead and roll a

234
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:58,149
perception check for Trinket.

235
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:00,017
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Trinket.

236
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:04,570
LAURA: He saw it happen! He's got really good
vision.

237
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,612
MARISHA: Come on, Trink.

238
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:08,770
TALIESIN: Yay!

239
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,409
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's like 24.

240
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:18,029
MATT: Yeah, Trinket just jumps over. The door's
only slightly open so Trinket has to stop and

241
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,466
wedge his way through.

242
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,657
LAURA: Can he cannonball into her? To try to catch
her?

243
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:24,849
MATT: It's the same speed as if he dashed. It
would be the same speed.

244
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,005
LAURA: All right.

245
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:33,951
MATT: However, it takes a moment to get through.
You guys now get down the stairs. As Trinket opens

246
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:44,607
the door and wedges through, there's a scent out
there, but she's nowhere in visible range. She's

247
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:51,160
either darted off the path or possibly off the
actual sides, and you can see now the struggle

248
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,476
that's happened. You can now hear in the distance
the sound of yells and fighting and there doesn't

249
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,861
appear to be any one side or the other pushing.

250
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,211
LAURA: I whistle at Trinket to get him to stop.

251
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,617
MATT: Okay, as you get to the landing you whistle
out, and Trinket is just now pushing through the

252
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:11,485
door and gets out for a bit, looking back and
forth. Looks over the shoulder, and runs back to

253
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:16,834
you. It appears that Ripley has scattered into
Whitestone somewhere.

254
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,440
SAM: Damn it.

255
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,729
TRAVIS: We stop.

256
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,731
MATT: Okay.

257
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:24,323
LAURA: We need to find the Briarwoods.

258
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:28,836
TALIESIN: I'm still upstairs. Are you going to
come meet us again upstairs?

259
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:33,554
SAM: We'll get Trinket and go back upstairs,
wherever they are.

260
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:36,836
TALIESIN: Taking a short rest.

261
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:39,759
MARISHA: We're taking a short rest?

262
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,767
TALIESIN: We're waiting there. They followed her
down; I'm waiting on Cassandra.

263
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,847
TRAVIS: I could stay down in that foyer.

264
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:48,084
TALIESIN: Come up.

265
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,451
MATT: Are you waiting in the study?

266
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:50,678
TALIESIN: Yeah, waiting in the study.

267
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:53,962
MATT: Okay, she goes off to her room. You're there
for a few minutes.

268
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,506
TALIESIN: Does Grog show up?

269
00:24:55,506 --> 00:25:06,829
SAM: We come back and say, that Ripley is very
talented. She got away. Talented Dr. Ripley.

270
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:17,479
TALIESIN: We have bigger issues than Anna at this
point. Grog, do you have the Bag of Holding?

271
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,561
TRAVIS: I do.

272
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,986
TALIESIN: Can you scoop up what's left of
Professor Anders?

273
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:28,853
LAURA: Can I loot him first? I mean, just see
what's on him.

274
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:30,837
TRAVIS: Like, his head bits?

275
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:36,712
TALIESIN: I don't want any of him sticking
around.

276
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,612
MARISHA: Do we have to put him in the Bag of
Holding, though?

277
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:40,262
TRAVIS: Why can't we just set him on fire?

278
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,967
MARISHA: Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something
for now.

279
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,579
TALIESIN: Fire will do.

280
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,517
TRAVIS: Is there a fireplace in the room?

281
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,622
TALIESIN: There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll
throw him in the fire.

282
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:52,463
LAURA: Wait. Let me see what's on him, first.

283
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:55,090
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

284
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,714
TALIESIN: We don't want him coming back.

285
00:25:56,714 --> 00:26:02,177
MATT: He's crumpled up against the desk in the
corner, there's all these papers that got pushed

286
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,931
off the side, there were a bunch of random
scrawlings.

287
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,178
LAURA: 24.

288
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:19,167
MATT: 24? Okay. You search his body. You find 120
gold pieces on him. Not a whole lot. He doesn't

289
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:25,400
keep his important shit on him, for the most part.
You do find, however, the boots that he's wearing

290
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:34,468
are very finely crafted, and unlike the rest of
his wear, have a hand-stitching in it that is

291
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:40,562
exemplary in construction and doesn't match with
the rest of his ensemble. So it seems like

292
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:44,188
something you'd wear more for function than for
actual style. Pardon.

293
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,472
LAURA: I take them.

294
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,152
MATT: You take them.

295
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,319
TALIESIN: Take his shoes.

296
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,329
MATT: Okay.

297
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,801
LAURA: Does anybody have magic? Can you see what
these are?

298
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,542
SAM: Sure, I can look at them.

299
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:55,993
LAURA: Look at these, Scanlan.

300
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,259
SAM: I look at them.

301
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:00,894
MATT: Okay, if you're taking a short rest, you can
take the short rest to inspect the boots, get the

302
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:08,319
feel for them, they are indeed enchanted. They are
a pair of Boots of Levitation. Once per day, you

303
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,259
can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes
as per the spell. You can't actually move as part

304
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,474
of it, you just levitate in the air, and you have
to push off to get space.

305
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:19,783
TRAVIS: So like zero-G.

306
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:20,617
MATT: Zero-G.

307
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:21,764
TALIESIN: Like Willy Wonka.

308
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,402
MARISHA: Zero-G boots! Oh, hell yeah.

309
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,749
SAM: Who do they fit?

310
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:29,953
MATT: They fit anyone who wishes to put them on.
Magical items alter themselves.

311
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,668
MARISHA: Oh, we're playing with that later.

312
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,590
TRAVIS: I'll just hang onto it. I'll just hold
onto it.

313
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,828
MARISHA: Can we all just try them once when we get
back to Greyskull Keep?

314
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,603
MATT: Anything else you want to do while you're
waiting?

315
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:42,608
SAM: Anything else in the room? Can I sniff around
the room and investigate?

316
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,284
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

317
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:46,164
TRAVIS: I drag Anders over to the fireplace.

318
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,859
LIAM: I'll look with Scanlan.

319
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,320
SAM: 12.

320
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,749
TRAVIS: He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap
some joints.

321
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:53,039
LIAM: 27.

322
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,377
MATT: Okay, good. As you're looking through and
finding papers, papers and ledgers and tough

323
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:04,357
discussions of old classes, untouched on the side,
you go through one of the bottom drawers, and

324
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,559
there's a lock to it.

325
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,083
LIAM: Well, let's unlock that.

326
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,421
SAM: Vax, do you need my help to unlock it?

327
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,869
LIAM: No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps
in there?

328
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,591
MATT: Make a perception check.

329
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,511
LIAM: Oh, that is 20.

330
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:19,240
MATT: It does appear to be trapped.

331
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,648
SAM: It does appear to be trapped?

332
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:23,580
LIAM: So what do I roll to undo that? Dexterity?
Lockpick?

333
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,612
MATT: Thieves' tools, as well. So same check you
did.

334
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:29,547
SAM: Oh, I can open it for you.

335
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:31,824
LIAM: That's a natural 20, so that's untrapped.

336
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:36,928
MATT: As part of that, you notice that this
mechanism is when it opens, if there isn't a

337
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:43,243
switch underneath it held that's hidden, it will
cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction

338
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:47,009
of whoever's in front of it. You hold the button,
you find it, you open it up without an issue, and

339
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:51,795
you find the spring mechanism, snap it, and remove
the little poison-tipped bolt,

340
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:52,941
and chuck it to the side.

341
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,446
LAURA: No, wait. Give me that. I take it.

342
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,739
MATT: Okay. You have a poison-tipped bolt.

343
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:57,688
LAURA: Okay.

344
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:00,821
MATT: For a tiny little hand-crossbow is
essentially what it is.

345
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:02,609
LIAM: So now I've got to unlock it, right?

346
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:03,565
MATT: Yeah.

347
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,111
LIAM: Yeah. Hey, 20.

348
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,320
MATT: Natural 20?

349
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,585
LIAM: No, not a natural 20.

350
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:11,114
MATT: Oh, okay. Easy enough to unlock at this
point, you get it open, you pull it open, there's

351
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,340
a collection of letters.

352
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:22,538
LIAM: Percival, come here. You're probably the
best person to know what to make of these.

353
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:28,538
MATT: You glance through and inspect them, and you
take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of

354
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:36,942
these letters while Cassandra's away. Many of them
talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting

355
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:42,850
to you as the information hits you, and you relay
this information to the group. Notes on the

356
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:52,284
removal of key magical defenses during the
political meeting at Emon. The discussion, as in

357
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:58,028
making sure that certain individuals and
safeguards that are usually made during political

358
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:02,567
meetings like that were not present during that
endeavor.

359
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,386
LAURA: Evidence is what that is!

360
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:11,306
MATT: Notes on best construction methods using the
mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the

361
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:12,468
ziggurat.

362
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:13,768
MARISHA and TRAVIS: The manse?

363
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,035
SAM: As in a mansion?

364
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:25,543
MATT: A manse is a place or a home; it has many
different meanings. They're warning Anders, and

365
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:28,569
there are multiple letters at different periods of
time over the past few years that are warning

366
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:31,447
Anders of an arrival of Seeker Asum's spies.

367
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:33,029
SAM: He's a good guy.

368
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:34,020
LAURA: Oh!

369
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,236
SAM: No, he's a bad guy?

370
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:41,641
MATT: There are letters talking about plotting,
diverting political attention away from Whitestone

371
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:50,399
to leave it a political enigma during this period
of time. There are letters talking about planting

372
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:57,500
information within Wildmount that would lead their
investigation team to believe the Briarwoods had

373
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,700
been found dead.

374
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,228
SAM: This is a whole paper trail!

375
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:06,731
MATT: And occasionally there are mentions in a lot
of these letters that speak of, "The Undying King

376
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,847
"shall return, we are his blood."

377
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,777
MARISHA: Jarl? What?

378
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:13,756
MATT: The Undying King shall return.

379
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,237
LAURA: Where did she get Jarl from?

380
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:16,285
MATT: We are his blood.

381
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:17,398
LAURA: Oh, "we are."

382
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:19,582
MARISHA: The Undying King...

383
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:20,670
TALIESIN: Shall return.

384
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,402
TALIESIN and SAM: We are his blood.

385
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:23,927
MARISHA: Which is what he said.

386
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,072
SAM: And then it says Jarl.

387
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,173
TALIESIN: Jarl. Maybe he was dictating.

388
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:28,697
MATT: The letters aren't signed.

389
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:32,217
SAM: Okay? Are they all of the same hand?

390
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:37,941
MATT: They are all of the same handwriting. In the
cluster, there is one completely unrelated letter

391
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:42,893
that talks about business ledgers and construction
of the bridge. It appears to be a simple

392
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:49,315
discussion on the future plans to construct the
bridge.

393
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:50,532
SAM: Is that in the same hand?

394
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:51,485
MATT: It is in the same handwriting.

395
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:52,433
SAM: And is it signed?

396
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,653
MATT: It is signed a Lord Riskel Daxio.

397
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:57,354
MARISHA: What! Who? Axio?

398
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:58,965
TRAVIS and SAM: Riskel Daxio.

399
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:00,339
MATT: Riskel Daxio.

400
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:01,745
LAURA and MARISHA: We know him!

401
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:02,812
MATT: Yep.

402
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:03,709
LAURA: Who is he?

403
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,153
MATT: He's on the Council of Tal'Dorei.

404
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:09,044
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, motherfucker! He's a spy.

405
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,452
MARISHA: He's our fucking spy!

406
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:15,074
MATT: He's technically also the one that helped
designate the construction of your keep and

407
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:16,326
plotted the construction stuff--

408
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:17,396
LAURA: Oh no.

409
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,458
SAM: He built our keep!

410
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,157
MARISHA: He's the construction guy, he's like our
head builder.

411
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:22,754
LIAM: He could be spying on us around the keep.

412
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:29,491
TALIESIN: He could have a secret entrance to our
Keep that he built and didn't tell us.

413
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,860
LAURA: Holy moly.

414
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,768
SAM: As soon as I see that, I go down in a crouch
and I shit-scry on our keep to

415
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:36,620
see if it's still there.

416
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,963
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's right, you did that!
And I put an elemental there. It's babysitting.

417
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:43,506
MATT: Yes, you did.

418
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:46,917
MARISHA: Hopefully still there. 30 days.

419
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:54,186
MATT: 30 days. Glancing within the kitchen, there
doesn't appear to be much that catches your

420
00:32:54,186 --> 00:32:54,963
attention.

421
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:56,210
TALIESIN: You shat in the kitchen?

422
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,572
SAM: I put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen
and I told them, don't clean it up.

423
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:03,111
MATT: Like you do.

424
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,591
SAM: You know.

425
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:05,507
LAURA: Like you do.

426
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:06,999
SAM: Thursdays.

427
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:11,475
TRAVIS: I've got Anders in the fireplace, and I
light the Firebrand War Hammer with the magic

428
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:14,192
word, bacon, and I hit it and set him on fire.

429
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:19,068
MATT: There was already a fire in the fireplace,
but you just stoke it a little further, and pretty

430
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:22,252
soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh
fills the room.

431
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,280
LAURA: Bacon?

432
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,931
TRAVIS: Yeah, bacon. Did you not know that's what
the word was?

433
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,929
SAM: So everything's fine at the keep?

434
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,362
MATT: At the time.

435
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:31,970
SAM: At the time, okay.

436
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,251
MATT: At least, there's nothing on fire, there's
no screams, there's no movement. It just seems

437
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:36,903
like the cold kitchen is untouched.

438
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:41,270
SAM: Guys, my shit saw no movement.

439
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,408
(laughter)

440
00:33:43,408 --> 00:33:46,267
LAURA: Good to know, Scanlan.

441
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:49,611
TALIESIN: You've squeezed all you're going to be
able to get out of that.

442
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:57,302
TRAVIS: Percy. Can we get into the underground
caverns from here?

443
00:33:57,302 --> 00:34:02,635
TALIESIN: Can I think of a way? I'm assuming I
know a way to where this might be.

444
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:09,595
MATT: As you have this conversation, a voice from
the doorway rings out. "I can take you." You look

445
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,981
over, and it's Cassandra.

446
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:12,248
TALIESIN: She's going to take us.

447
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:13,374
SAM: Is that your sister?

448
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:14,298
TALIESIN: Apparently.

449
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:19,905
MATT: She's currently now dressed in armor you've
seen as ornamental before. It was armor that your

450
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:25,607
mother trained in when she was young, but was
unused for a long time. It seems to be

451
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:31,297
serviceable; it's been updated and such. She
slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side, and

452
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:36,674
her hair is pulled back and tied off, and she
looks at the rest of the room. "So are we ready?"

453
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,586
TRAVIS: Let me see your neck.

454
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:42,538
MATT: She steps up and lifts her chin up towards
you.

455
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,888
SAM: By the way, this is Grog.

456
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:45,412
LIAM: I'm going to insight check as he does that.

457
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:47,093
TALIESIN: These are my friends, by the way.

458
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,908
TRAVIS: Do I see anything on her neck?

459
00:34:49,908 --> 00:34:54,833
MATT: No. It seems fine. There's no signs of any
puncture wounds. Rolling?

460
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:55,892
LIAM: It's a 15.

461
00:34:55,892 --> 00:35:01,188
MATT: Okay. She seems as determined as the rest of
you.

462
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:04,414
LAURA: All right.

463
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:07,620
TALIESIN: Lead the way, sister.

464
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,915
MATT: She turns around and she begins walking back
down the hallway.

465
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:16,823
LAURA: Can we expect any more traps that you're
aware of?

466
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:22,402
MATT: "That I'm aware of, no, but I'm certain that
there may be. They know you're coming, it seems.

467
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:26,063
"So be wary. Be careful. I'll take you to the
undercroft."

468
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:27,836
LIAM: Did we just have a short rest here?

469
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:28,777
MATT: You did.

470
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:30,379
LIAM: Going to heal up.

471
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:43,068
SAM: Hey, Percival. Any chance you can load up one
of Ripley's guns for me?

472
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:50,191
TALIESIN: I don't know if it will actually-- I
would have to probably train you in

473
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,431
how to use it.

474
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:57,414
SAM: Really? I've seen you use it. You just pull
your finger on the finger part and the big boom

475
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:58,727
part goes out.

476
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,399
TALIESIN: It's a little more complicated than
that, actually.

477
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,812
SAM: Well, you have to point it at the thing you
want to be boomed.

478
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:07,400
MATT: He could use it, he just wouldn't be able to
add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls.

479
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,652
TALIESIN: I'll load one for you. I'll give him
her boomstick.

480
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,375
MATT: Okay. You take it. You inspect it as you
guys are walking along.

481
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,227
TALIESIN: Just making sure it functions, too.

482
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:22,465
MATT: It seems pretty functional. It's
well-constructed, it's sleek. Your Pepperbox has a

483
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:27,807
bit of flair to its design, this is your
background. Hers is just streamlined, simple, much

484
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:32,791
like the decor of her room when you saw it. She
doesn't mess with anything fancy or unnecessary.

485
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:39,860
The ammunition she does have are made specific to
size to her pistol. They will not function for the

486
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,450
Pepperbox, unfortunately. They will only work for
the pistol.

487
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,956
TALIESIN: Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm
doing okay.

488
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:51,906
MATT: It does act as a pistol for rules-wise,
which is on your sheet here, so yes, you would

489
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:53,027
have that.

490
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,061
LAURA: Do you want it? Just in case yours
misfires?

491
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,628
TALIESIN: I'll steal it back from him if I need,
but it should be fine.

492
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:04,935
SAM: I'd like to make an athletics check.
Athletics. See if I can spin it around and put it

493
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:06,263
in my pocket.

494
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:08,782
LAURA: Wait, where did you get it? I had it in my
belt.

495
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:10,133
TALIESIN: No, if you have it.

496
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,026
LAURA: I have it.

497
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:12,031
SAM: Okay, give it to me.

498
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:13,106
TALIESIN: Give it to him.

499
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,759
MARISHA: Put your eye out.

500
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:18,000
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll dexterity, roll
a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

501
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,313
LIAM: Don't roll a one.

502
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:23,275
TALIESIN: This is literally how she lost her
hand.

503
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:26,770
SAM: Wait, what's this? Why does it say plus
four?

504
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,884
LAURA: This music is awful as you're checking.

505
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,926
MARISHA: Yeah, the violins plinking.

506
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:34,482
SAM: Well, it's zero, but it says a big plus four
next to it for some reason.

507
00:37:34,595 --> 00:37:39,178
MATT: I don't know. Add zero. What did you roll?

508
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:40,445
SAM: It was 14.

509
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:45,779
MATT: Okay. You manage to get it in there.
Thankfully it's not loaded, because you feel the

510
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,514
trigger go off. But there wasn't a bullet loaded,
so it's like (click).

511
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,050
TRAVIS: Yeah, we took out the ammunition.

512
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,666
SAM: Okay, now give me a bullet.

513
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:56,732
TRAVIS: Maybe don't do that.

514
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:01,555
TALIESIN: I hand him the ammunition. I load four
of them.

515
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:02,835
SAM: Yeah!

516
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:04,839
LAURA: Giving him a loaded gun?

517
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:07,243
SAM: I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But
I'm a little big boy.

518
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,758
LIAM: I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab
it out of his hand.

519
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,104
SAM: I will prevent him from doing that!

520
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,109
MATT: Okay.

521
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:16,527
MARISHA: You guys are fighting over a loaded gun.

522
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,756
MATT: Sleight-of-hand check. Athletics check.

523
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:23,985
LIAM: You go first.

524
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:26,055
SAM: Is this a skill check?

525
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,245
MATT: Yeah. Add your athletics to your roll.

526
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,472
SAM: 17!

527
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,440
LIAM: Shut up. 27.

528
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,941
MATT: As you go to be, "No, what are you--" It's
already gone. You don't even know where it went,

529
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,487
you didn't see him take it, you just all of a
sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you.

530
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:43,667
LIAM: And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give
her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra?

531
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,608
MATT: "Yes."

532
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:50,488
LIAM: I was at the door. He had a knife to your
throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What

533
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:51,815
did he want you to say?

534
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:57,021
MATT: "He wanted me to shout for help. He wanted
me to draw you in."

535
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,892
LAURA: Can I insight check her to see if she's
telling the truth?

536
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:00,860
MATT: Yeah.

537
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:07,020
LIAM: You've been living here. How did it come
that he had a blade to your throat today? How did

538
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,886
it all unravel? Have you been living here?

539
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:09,954
LAURA: 24.

540
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:11,934
MATT: 24. She's telling the truth.

541
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,644
LAURA: Okay. That's good.

542
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:23,418
MATT: "Well, after the arrows felled me-- I guess
I should start at the beginning." And she's

543
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:27,504
walking along with you guys as she's leading you
down the stairs and down to the bottom floor. She

544
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:30,436
doesn't look to you. She's still looking ahead,
very intent.

545
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,980
LAURA: I take that pistol back from you.

546
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:41,369
MATT: "After the arrows felled me, I recovered.
Father Reynal found me. Brought me from the brink

547
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:51,051
"at the temple of Pelor outside of town. Things
hadn't fallen quite that far back then. We had

548
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:58,720
"more people in the city. At the time, the
Briarwood rule was fresh and folks were eager to

549
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,931
"speak out against what they had wrought on this
city, the fall of the de Rolos.

550
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:07,252
"We still thought they had fallen to plague, but
through some unfortunate political business, they

551
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:13,322
"had come to power, but we began to question it. I
knew better. I told the truth once I'd recovered.

552
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:22,932
"We began to build our first rebellion. Two years
we built up the resistance before we made our

553
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:32,886
"first move. They seemed to know exactly what we
were plotting. Cut us off at every angle.

554
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:43,480
"Couldn't see who it was who was giving up our
information, but I knew it was close. But before I

555
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:51,563
"had the opportunity, I was helming a group that
was traveling to utilize the escape route that I

556
00:40:51,606 --> 00:41:00,672
"took you through when they first attacked. It was
just after dusk, and Lord Briarwood was there

557
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:13,539
"waiting for us in the forest. He slaughtered most
of the men, but he recognized my face from the

558
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,808
"dinner we had the night they took the castle.

559
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:33,155
"They did not harm me, strangely. They treated me
like a guest against my will, in my own house. I

560
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:40,648
"seemed to ascertain that by keeping me there,
having a member of the house within their grasp,

561
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,810
"they could use that as leverage. I don't know.

562
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:50,517
"Sylas, he had his charms, and there were many
that worked beneath them against their own will.

563
00:41:50,517 --> 00:42:03,932
"It did not work on me. My hatred was too strong.
So instead, they tried to provide me with wealth.

564
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:15,272
"Power, here in Whitestone. I just took to reading
and ignoring it all. I don't know why they kept me

565
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:21,650
"around, but I wasn't going to question it if it
gave me a chance to possibly undermine them."

566
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:28,159
She grabs the side of her sword as you guys have
now reached now down the long hallway towards the

567
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,407
back of the castle. You know the direction she's
taking you. It leads to the cellar, to the

568
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:35,546
undercroft and the de Rolo mausoleum.

569
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:49,329
"Three years of reading in that library. Father's
library. Strategy. Tactics. Old lines of

570
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:58,620
"information, as well as the myths and history of
Whitestone. I found allies within the castle. I

571
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,770
"contacted Yennen, and through him, Archibald, who
helped me build the first rebellion.

572
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:14,743
"Archibald still lives, Percy. He's been
completely necessary for what we've built here."

573
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:23,747
She looks down at her armor as you guys reach the
edge of the cellar, and she pulls the door open

574
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:33,993
quietly. There's wooden stairs that lead down into
the cellar. She taps her armor. "This was

575
00:43:33,993 --> 00:43:39,443
"Mother's. It's good to know I'm not the only
tomboy in the bloodline." Brushes the hair out of

576
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:42,939
her face, and for the first time really looks at
you with a smile since she first saw you.

577
00:43:42,939 --> 00:44:00,620
TALIESIN: (sighs) Can we do one thing before we go
down into the cellar? This is the best day of my

578
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:06,995
life, and I can't help but be suspicious.

579
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:09,789
MATT: "I completely understand."

580
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:18,918
TALIESIN: Is there any way to check if she's being
controlled?

581
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:21,323
TRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing.

582
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:22,978
TALIESIN: Can we put your helmet on her?

583
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:31,102
MATT: The only thing you really have seen work is
the Greater Restoration spell you cast on Seeker

584
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:36,818
Asum when you guys were with the Council of
Tal'Dorei. That did seem to remove any sort of

585
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:38,527
charm effects, if that's what you're asking.

586
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,996
LAURA: We don't have that?

587
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:47,521
MARISHA: I didn't learn it. Not for today. I
thought Pike's magic would hold up.

588
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,092
TRAVIS: I can try and jog her memory.

589
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:54,561
MATT: "What can I do to make you trust me?"

590
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:55,884
SAM: Punch her in the face?

591
00:44:55,884 --> 00:44:58,576
TALIESIN: I do trust you. That's the problem.

592
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:03,112
MATT: She smiles a little. "Whatever you need."

593
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:10,240
TALIESIN: I've got nothing. (sighs)

594
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,653
MATT: Does anyone have any creative means with
which they would want to check?

595
00:45:18,695 --> 00:45:21,624
TALIESIN: What would happen if we put your helmet
on her?

596
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:24,689
MARISHA: If she's already controlled--

597
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,784
TALIESIN: This would disrupt it, maybe.

598
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:30,359
MARISHA: We could try it. It doesn't hurt to put a
hat on.

599
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,077
LAURA: It has to be attuned over a short rest,
though.

600
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,270
MARISHA: It does.

601
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,464
TALIESIN: Does the hat need to be attuned over a
short rest?

602
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:37,762
MATT: In theory.

603
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:45,840
LIAM: I want to suggest something to you. We rest
here for a half hour, and I give this to you. This

604
00:45:45,840 --> 00:46:01,841
came from a very strange creature. It will help
you resist any control, if there is any control,

605
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:10,271
and one of us-- you could even choose-- could
strike you and try to take you out of it, and if

606
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:14,860
you are not being controlled, then you are being
struck across the face, and I'm sorry for that,

607
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:22,765
but if you are, there's a possibility we'd pull
you out. I know that would hurt, but it would go a

608
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:24,799
long way to earn our trust.

609
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:33,348
MATT: "If that's what it takes." She takes it from
your hand and inspects it for a second. "Shoddy

610
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:38,375
"craftsmanship." Places it on her head, and it's a
little big at first,

611
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,319
then it conforms to her head.

612
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,833
LIAM: Your choice.

613
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:48,577
MATT: She sits down a couple of steps deeper into
the cellar. Curls around a corner; ushers you all

614
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,124
over into the shadows.

615
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:52,376
MARISHA: Can I see, before we leave, are we near
any windows?

616
00:46:52,376 --> 00:47:01,940
MATT: From this location? No. All the windows that
would be here would face out into the north side

617
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,288
of Whitestone, which is forested.

618
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,354
MARISHA: Backyard?

619
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,987
MATT: You guys are on the north side of the castle
now. The city is south from you.

620
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:08,446
MARISHA: All right.

621
00:47:08,446 --> 00:47:17,131
MATT: So you take a moment and sit. While you guys
are waiting, she takes a moment. She's adjusting

622
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:24,563
it and feeling it and inspecting her hands.
(sighs) "I don't feel any different.

623
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:26,297
"While we wait--"

624
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:28,744
LIAM: What if the little one struck you?

625
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:30,838
SAM: Struck her?

626
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:33,263
LAURA: Give it some time.

627
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:36,356
MATT: She gives a wry grin. "Whatever you
choose."

628
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:40,136
SAM: I could try to tell if she's evil or not.
Would that help?

629
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,077
LAURA: Yeah.

630
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:45,590
LIAM: I don't know. I don't think she's evil. She
could be a puppet.

631
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:56,726
MARISHA: Can I try this? This is a long shot. My--
actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves.

632
00:47:56,726 --> 00:48:03,456
We're immune to charm effects. Or we have
resistance.

633
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:04,856
LIAM: Resistant to it.

634
00:48:04,856 --> 00:48:14,386
MARISHA: Advantage against saves. Since we have
that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of

635
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:18,005
us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a
charm?

636
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:22,750
MATT: Your resistance doesn't make you attuned to
it. Unfortunately, it's just a natural ability

637
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,828
that's inherent. Her being human, there's not a
way to really correlate with that. I mean, you've

638
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:30,486
read over her a few times, doing insight checks.

639
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:32,446
TALIESIN: Wait, it was Greater Restoration?

640
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:33,347
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

641
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:34,466
TALIESIN: Ah!

642
00:48:34,466 --> 00:48:37,906
SAM: You have that?

643
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:41,623
TALIESIN: I have a potion. This should solve all
of our problems.

644
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:44,465
SAM: Or you could save that for when one of us
becomes a vampire.

645
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:49,998
TALIESIN: No, it will be-- And I'm pulling out a
potion bottle. This is if you are controlled.

646
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:51,980
This could fix it.

647
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,336
MATT: She puts her hand out. Her leather glove's
pulled over it now. You've never seen her militant

648
00:48:57,336 --> 00:49:00,559
before, and it's a really interesting visual to
you.

649
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,132
TALIESIN: I look at her.

650
00:49:02,132 --> 00:49:16,930
MATT: She drinks the potion. Whole thing down.
(coughs)

651
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,575
TALIESIN: That was actually a minor healing
potion. I was just seeing if you did it

652
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:20,747
intentionally.

653
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:22,970
(laughter)

654
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,502
MATT: She gives a wry grin and wipes her mouth. "I
thought I recognized that terrible earthy taste."

655
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:30,008
She tosses the crystal decanter to you.

656
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,521
LIAM: Clever boy.

657
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:35,102
MATT: "Huh. You always were the clever one."

658
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:41,987
TALIESIN: I figured it was worth a shot. Best
we're going to do.

659
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:43,775
SAM: Am I supposed to punch her in the face now?

660
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:44,750
LIAM: No.

661
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,933
MATT: "Do you need this thing?"

662
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:48,234
LIAM: I'll take it back, yeah.

663
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:49,449
MATT: She hands it back to you.

664
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,214
TALIESIN: All right.

665
00:49:51,214 --> 00:50:00,148
MATT: There's a fascination she has with her
armor. "I've not been able to wear this before. It

666
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:02,721
"feels good to have something close to Mother."

667
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:05,977
TALIESIN: It's been a long time. (sighs)

668
00:50:05,977 --> 00:50:13,259
MATT: "Simon repaired it for me when he was
working here. I haven't seen him in a while. I'm

669
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,655
"worried."

670
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:18,656
TALIESIN: Let's go down and take care of this.
Cass?

671
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:22,592
MATT: She leads you down through the cellar--

672
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:26,996
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. Before we enter: it's safe
to assume they know we're coming, correct?

673
00:50:26,996 --> 00:50:27,955
SAM: If they're there.

674
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:29,293
LAURA: Yeah.

675
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,155
TALIESIN: Yeah.

676
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:32,730
LIAM: Better safe than sorry.

677
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:38,880
SAM: Can I ask Cassandra--

678
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,314
MATT: You can ask her anything you'd like.

679
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:45,647
SAM: Are the Briarwoods going to be down there?
Are they here?

680
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:50,210
MATT: She goes, "I have no confirmation of it, but
they spend most of their time down here. They're

681
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,608
"preparing for something."

682
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:53,236
LIAM: Have you ever been down here?

683
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:58,341
MATT: "I'm not allowed down here, by their orders,
but I've snuck down a few times out of curiosity.

684
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:06,196
"I've only gotten so far before I had to return,
but I've made it through the undercroft, through

685
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:12,413
"most of the tunnels, and I've gotten to the
distillery, and that's about as far as I've

686
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:17,250
"gotten. But I've followed them down here, and they
usually come with a group of guards,

687
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,741
"four or five strong."

688
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:22,415
LAURA: All right.

689
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:26,045
TRAVIS: Are there sentries? Can we expect to find
traps, lookouts?

690
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:30,874
MATT: "It's definitely a possibility, so move
quietly. Be careful."

691
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,453
LAURA: What is Lady Briarwood?

692
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:41,540
MATT: "What is Lady Briarwood? She's a wicked
beast of a creature, is what she is. I'd use less

693
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,062
"savory words, but my brother's here."

694
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:47,050
TALIESIN: There's a first time for everything, I
suppose.

695
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:56,483
MATT: As she leads you guys down the stairs
towards the undercroft, she goes, "She's not like

696
00:51:56,483 --> 00:52:07,609
"her husband. That I know. As far as I can tell,
she's human, but she has a very powerful control

697
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:13,911
"over life and death. She's a practitioner of the
arcane, definitely, but her focus seems to be

698
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:23,520
"necromancy on a wide scale. And while Delilah and
Sylas are man and wife, they speak of another."

699
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:26,787
SAM: They speak of another?

700
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:29,116
LAURA: The guy that they're trying to bring back.

701
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:31,739
MATT: "It's as if a third party completes their
union."

702
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:34,365
SAM: Oh, this is the king that will rise again?

703
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:40,694
MATT: "They don't say any names. They refer to him
as 'him' or 'The Whispered One.' No reference

704
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:41,882
"beyond that."

705
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:43,081
LAURA: (gasps)

706
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:44,199
SAM: What?

707
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,209
LAURA: (whispering) What if it's the guy in
Percy?

708
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:47,041
SAM: What if it's what?

709
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,276
TALIESIN: I'm having that thought, as well.

710
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:49,847
LAURA: Percy's smoke monster.

711
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:50,989
SAM: Oh shit.

712
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:52,013
MARISHA: Oh boy.

713
00:52:52,013 --> 00:52:55,914
LIAM: He's playing both sides, possibly,
Percival.

714
00:52:55,914 --> 00:53:02,878
SAM: Oh, another question for Cassandra. The duke,
Negmeyer? Vegmeyer? Venkman?

715
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:04,511
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Quagmire.

716
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:06,865
MATT: "Vedmeyer, yes."

717
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:10,449
SAM: Vedmeyer. Have you seen him around the castle
today, or recently?

718
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:13,357
MATT: "I've only seen him in the castle maybe
three times since we've been here."

719
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,860
SAM: Because Grog? He's a goliath.

720
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,320
TRAVIS: He's-- wait, what?

721
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,394
SAM: He's a big goliath, so if he's here, you
should just, you know--

722
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:24,759
TRAVIS: How did you see him?

723
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:30,131
SAM: Oh, when I was a dinosaur and I burned down a
house and killed a bunch of people...

724
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:33,949
TALIESIN: That's a series of words that I know
individually, but he strings them together in ways

725
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,271
that don't make any sense.

726
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:38,910
SAM: I wouldn't say fought, because I beat him
really easily, and then I ran away.

727
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,174
TRAVIS: Oh, you killed him?

728
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:46,267
SAM: No, I just pushed him off a building, then I
thought that was enough for the day,

729
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:47,579
so I went home.

730
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:54,238
MATT: Cassandra looks over her shoulder at this.
"It's a shame you're not as tall as your tales,

731
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:55,291
"small one."

732
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:58,928
SAM: Well, thank you. I'll take that as a
compliment.

733
00:53:58,928 --> 00:54:00,195
TALIESIN: No!

734
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,714
SAM: Don't worry.

735
00:54:01,714 --> 00:54:03,442
MARISHA: (laughing) No.

736
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:05,306
(laughter)

737
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:09,721
SAM: Before we cross the precipice into this--
what is it, undercroft?

738
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:11,381
MATT: Undercroft she was referring to, yes.

739
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:18,757
SAM: Percival, we all have fought with you this
whole time, and you know that we have your back

740
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:23,683
and that we're with you in this 100 percent. But
I'd like our enemies to know that, as well, so

741
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:29,864
with your permission, I will cast Seeming on all
of us. And I make the girls look like Cassandra,

742
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:34,999
and the boys look like Percy. So I give us all the
gray hair.

743
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:37,691
TALIESIN: You crazy motherfucker!

744
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:44,611
SAM: And if possible, I'd like to emblazon the
sign of the rebellion on our chests in sort of an

745
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:47,231
awesome Superman glowing thing.

746
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:59,841
MATT: With a flicker of Scanlan's arcane mastery,
all of you form into a small battalion of Percys

747
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,144
and Cassandras.

748
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:02,574
LIAM: Is he a big Percy?

749
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:08,406
MATT: He would have to be, yeah, because he still
stays similar to his actual size, so if Percy was

750
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:10,012
a little thicker and a little taller--

751
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,175
MARISHA: Percy's been hitting the 'roids.

752
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,186
MATT: Yep.

753
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:14,303
LAURA: What is Trinket?

754
00:55:14,303 --> 00:55:17,606
SAM: A bear with two streaks of white hair.

755
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,127
(all laugh)

756
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,831
LAURA: And he's wearing little circle glasses.

757
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:26,117
SAM: Yeah, with the little glasses. We are all de
Rolos today.

758
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,565
MARISHA: He's a Hello Trinket!

759
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,413
TALIESIN: Hello Trinket?

760
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,436
MARISHA: Hello Trinket.

761
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:40,616
MATT: Cassandra looks around very confused for a
second. "Curious, yes."

762
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:45,881
MARISHA: But abrasive. Right? You're put off by
it, so it works. It's working.

763
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:47,118
SAM: Possibly confused.

764
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:49,369
TALIESIN: Abrasiveness is his most powerful
weapon.

765
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:57,484
MATT: "So I'm beginning to see. Well, then." She
pulls her shortsword out. "Shall we?"

766
00:55:57,484 --> 00:56:00,013
LAURA: Are we going in to fight now?

767
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,651
TRAVIS: We're going into the cavern.

768
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:02,840
LAURA: I'm stealthing.

769
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,903
MATT: "As are we all." Everyone roll stealth
checks.

770
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:11,149
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace? Yeah,
I'm going to use Pass Without a Trace, because I

771
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:12,764
don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells.

772
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:13,767
MATT: Okay.

773
00:56:13,767 --> 00:56:15,024
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Please.

774
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:15,878
MATT: Plus ten.

775
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:17,076
LAURA: Yeah, plus ten to your stealth.

776
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:17,877
SAM: Oh, really?

777
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:18,661
LAURA: Yeah.

778
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:19,421
TALIESIN: Thank god.

779
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,125
TRAVIS: Boom!

780
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,196
LAURA: Natural 20!

781
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:22,231
LIAM: You're welcome.

782
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:24,870
TRAVIS: 26. Natural 20.

783
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,601
LIAM: 30. Natural 20.

784
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:29,405
LAURA: Oh, natural 20.

785
00:56:29,405 --> 00:56:31,065
MATT: 30, plus whatever your bonus is.

786
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:32,849
LIAM: That's with the bonus.

787
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,303
MATT: I thought you rolled a natural 20?

788
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:36,700
LAURA: That's 29, that's 39.

789
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,916
MATT: Oh, you?

790
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,229
LAURA: 39 for me.

791
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,894
MATT: 39? Your sister just out-stealthed you.

792
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:42,349
LIAM: I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt.

793
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:44,287
SAM: Do we all get plus ten?

794
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,162
TALIESIN: Yeah.

795
00:56:45,162 --> 00:56:46,235
SAM: Oh, then 29.

796
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:47,459
MARISHA: 28.

797
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:48,521
TALIESIN: 21.

798
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:52,129
MATT: You all (whoosh) vanish.

799
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:55,461
MARISHA: Before we go in, I go, Vax?

800
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:58,335
LAURA: How do you know it's him?

801
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,863
MATT: Solid point.

802
00:57:00,863 --> 00:57:01,984
MARISHA: Vax?

803
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,600
SAM: Yes, it's me.

804
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,646
TALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth?

805
00:57:04,646 --> 00:57:05,621
MARISHA: Vax?

806
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:08,409
(laughter)

807
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:17,623
SAM: Yes, it's me, Vax. What do you need? It's
me.

808
00:57:17,623 --> 00:57:19,051
LIAM: Kiki, I'm over here.

809
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:20,571
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Scanlan!

810
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:27,901
LAURA: This is really creepy because it's brother
and sister talking to each other right now. It

811
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:29,966
looks like Percival and Cassandra.

812
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:32,954
MATT: She's very uncomfortable right now, by the
way.

813
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:36,725
TALIESIN: Is there anybody who is not made
uncomfortable by this?

814
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:41,325
MARISHA: This was supposed to be a passing
comment, and it's turned into a thing. (laughs)

815
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:49,877
Be careful.

816
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:51,357
TALIESIN: Of course, Keyleth.

817
00:57:51,357 --> 00:57:52,408
LAURA: He will be.

818
00:57:52,408 --> 00:57:55,657
MARISHA: God damn it! I can't do this anymore.

819
00:57:55,657 --> 00:57:56,650
TALIESIN: Carry on.

820
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,150
MARISHA: Just go. Let's go. Can we go?

821
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:04,486
SAM: Sister Vex? Do you mind giving me that gun
again?

822
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:06,293
MARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan.

823
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:08,188
TALIESIN: It will be no problem at all.

824
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:09,689
LAURA: No, you can't have it.

825
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,617
SAM: Why, because I'm three feet tall?

826
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,352
LAURA: Because I want it.

827
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:16,009
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Is this the body-switching
episode?

828
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:19,669
TALIESIN: Right.

829
00:58:19,669 --> 00:58:20,843
SAM: Let's go.

830
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:21,696
TALIESIN: Let's go.

831
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:28,063
MATT: Continuing down, a long set of
whitestone-constructed stairs descend for about 45

832
00:58:28,063 --> 00:58:40,079
feet before they level off into the de Rolo
mausoleum. A long hallway continues forward that

833
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:48,194
contains two ten-by-ten stone structures that
contain the entombed bodies of previous

834
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:54,325
generations of de Rolos, with six passages-- three
on each side-- that split off of this main hallway

835
00:58:54,325 --> 00:59:03,770
that contain their own stone-encapsulated corpses.
This is a place of silent prayer and showing

836
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:09,356
appreciation for the previous families. Not all of
them are full, and there were extensions planned

837
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:17,411
as the family grew, but the first thing you notice
is all of the tomb doors are open.

838
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:31,638
Is anyone holding a torch light source, going
through this?

839
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:33,721
LAURA: He's got his flaming war hammer.

840
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:35,335
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll light up my hands.

841
00:59:35,335 --> 00:59:37,871
TALIESIN: I think I still have a torch, actually.

842
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:40,382
MATT: Have you been carrying it with you
throughout this?

843
00:59:40,382 --> 00:59:41,379
TALIESIN: Yeah.

844
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:42,226
MATT: Okay.

845
00:59:42,226 --> 00:59:43,112
LIAM: Dagger.

846
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,630
MATT: Okay, so you have enough light sources to
keep a general idea of what's going on, and I know

847
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:50,298
a lot of you guys have darkvision, too, so you have a
pretty decent range. What's the marching order

848
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,320
here, guys? Just so I know, continuing down this
path.

849
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,749
SAM: We'll go Percy, Cassandra, Cassandra, Percy,
Percy, Percy, Percy, Cassandra.

850
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:00,508
MARISHA: Boy girl, boy girl, boy girl.

851
01:00:00,508 --> 01:00:02,563
LAURA: I'm going to perception ahead, so I'll be
towards the front.

852
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,942
MATT: Towards the front?

853
01:00:03,942 --> 01:00:06,436
LIAM: How about Grog in second place? You big
sponge.

854
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,320
MATT: Is Trinket staying with you or staying in
back?

855
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,549
LAURA: He's going to stay further back.

856
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:10,769
MARISHA: Put me in a happy middle.

857
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:15,163
MATT: Grog's second. Keyleth is, you said, in the
middle?

858
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:16,326
SAM: She's lucky Pierre.

859
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:18,086
MATT: All right, the rest of you guys?

860
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:21,388
LAURA: Trinket's staying close to Scanlan.

861
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:23,678
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, you staying towards the
back?

862
01:00:23,678 --> 01:00:24,706
SAM: I guess so.

863
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:26,673
MATT: All right. Percy and Vax?

864
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:31,803
LIAM: I'll be behind Grog, as well.

865
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:34,498
TALIESIN: So I'll be in the back with my sister.

866
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:38,977
MATT: All right, and this is Cassandra.

867
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:41,118
LAURA: Oh no. She's so drunk.

868
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:43,768
MATT: Okay, so it's like a flying V formation you
guys are pushing in here.

869
01:00:43,768 --> 01:00:45,252
TALIESIN: Go home, de Rolo, you're drunk.

870
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:55,925
MATT: All right, so. You progress through the
undercroft as quietly as possible. You notice as

871
01:00:55,925 --> 01:01:01,330
you get past the first section, you look to your
right and left and the inside of these small like

872
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:08,908
cubby offshoots that contain these separate ten by
ten stone tombs. The walls have shelves burrowed

873
01:01:08,908 --> 01:01:17,654
into it, in which there are urns and small gems
and offerings-- things that were buried alongside

874
01:01:17,654 --> 01:01:21,426
the family members as part of a remembrance.

875
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:23,679
LIAM and LAURA: (make snatching noises)

876
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,451
MATT: Yeah, no. Don't go Skyrim on me.

877
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:27,900
TALIESIN: Yeah. Not fun.

878
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:34,417
MATT: Once again, you see the doors are open, and
from what you can tell, the stone lids on the

879
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:42,280
tombs are pulled off and to the side. Across the
way, as you move towards the center of the room to

880
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:48,778
the second set of openings, you can see the far
wall which, the room ends in the far side, but

881
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:56,658
there is about a 15, 20-foot wide and about a ten
to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall.

882
01:01:56,658 --> 01:02:03,036
And the closer you get, you see large piles of
dirt that fill one side of the room were put off

883
01:02:03,036 --> 01:02:09,143
to the side as if pieces of this dig were
discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the

884
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:13,979
ground that appears to have not been very well
cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and

885
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:21,195
out of this area. You also see, as you push
two-thirds into the room, broken pieces of

886
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:26,422
whitestone that had been carved into what looks
like parts of walls or pillars. Support things

887
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:34,220
that failed in their construction and just broke
and were tossed and discarded to the side. Make a

888
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,045
perception check.

889
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,158
MARISHA: Oh!

890
01:02:39,158 --> 01:02:42,560
TALIESIN: Oh! Natural 20.

891
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,683
SAM: Jesus.

892
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:45,460
TRAVIS: What the flipping fuck, man.

893
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,964
TALIESIN: I had a one today.

894
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,331
MATT: A one.

895
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:50,899
TRAVIS: And four 20s.

896
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:52,057
TALIESIN: I had a one.

897
01:02:52,057 --> 01:02:55,842
MATT: One of you Critters out there has to get
Taliesin a really, really pretty new d20 that he

898
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:57,448
has to use going forward.

899
01:02:57,448 --> 01:03:00,417
TALIESIN: That's shapeways.com.

900
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:01,662
MATT: Not that one!

901
01:03:01,662 --> 01:03:03,738
(laughter)

902
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,632
MATT: All right. So what did you get?

903
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:07,628
MARISHA: 29.

904
01:03:07,628 --> 01:03:08,528
SAM: 12.

905
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:09,603
LIAM: 26.

906
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:11,113
LAURA: I don't remember. It wasn't very good.

907
01:03:11,113 --> 01:03:11,918
MATT: Okay.

908
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:12,775
TRAVIS: 13.

909
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:21,046
MATT: Okay. Those of you with about 25 or above,
you glance and you find two of these slivers of

910
01:03:21,046 --> 01:03:31,012
this material you don't recognize and part of this
broken stone. It's like a dark green glass. About

911
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:37,415
a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers. You
only find a small scattering few, and it has a

912
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:48,367
grainy texture to it, and you take a look at it,
and it's transparent. You can see shapes through

913
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:53,291
it, but it's opaque enough to the point where it
distorts a little bit of the visual and color

914
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:54,583
behind it.

915
01:03:54,583 --> 01:04:00,755
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on this? Is this
similar to the broken glass that I collected

916
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:01,737
before?

917
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,943
MATT: Which broken glass you collected before?

918
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:07,987
MARISHA: I don't know. I just have broken glass
shards.

919
01:04:07,987 --> 01:04:10,421
TRAVIS: I feel like that was the red stones or
something from before.

920
01:04:10,421 --> 01:04:11,632
MARISHA: I feel like there was some sort of--

921
01:04:11,632 --> 01:04:13,223
TALIESIN: There was that sea of glass.

922
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:15,137
MARISHA: Yeah, we were in some cavern.

923
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:20,613
MATT: Oh, the sea of bone and glass? Okay. Yeah,
it is not similar to that, no. However, those who

924
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:23,554
are trained in arcana, you can go ahead and make
an arcana roll.

925
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:26,189
LAURA: Trained in arcana?

926
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:27,404
MATT: Trained in arcana.

927
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:29,319
LAURA: How do you know if you're trained in
arcana?

928
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:30,474
TRAVIS: Negative two.

929
01:04:30,474 --> 01:04:33,190
MATT: You would have filled in, if you have a
proficiency.

930
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,011
SAM: The dot?

931
01:04:34,011 --> 01:04:34,776
TALIESIN: The dot.

932
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:35,684
LAURA: Oh.

933
01:04:35,684 --> 01:04:37,504
SAM: Oh. 11.

934
01:04:37,504 --> 01:04:43,806
MATT: You have really no idea what this glass is.

935
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:45,059
LIAM: I grab it back.

936
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,216
MATT: Okay.

937
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:50,377
SAM: That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained
person here?

938
01:04:50,377 --> 01:04:51,356
LAURA: That's it?

939
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:54,951
SAM: Wow. Sorry, guys. Sorry.

940
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:56,656
MARISHA: Can I try a nature check on it?

941
01:04:56,656 --> 01:04:58,017
MATT: Sure.

942
01:04:58,017 --> 01:05:02,049
MARISHA: He's like, "It's not going to tell you
shit, but sure." 15?

943
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:12,964
MATT: It's glass. Most glass you understand is
designed by usually sand or other materials that

944
01:05:12,964 --> 01:05:17,787
at a high temperature or some sort of process is
melted and fused.

945
01:05:17,787 --> 01:05:22,218
MARISHA: So it's manufactured.

946
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:28,811
MATT: It appears to be, or naturally occurred, and
the structure of it has this bumpy, wavy-- it's

947
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:30,227
not like smooth glass.

948
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,495
MARISHA: Like when lightning hits sand?

949
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:34,526
MATT: Kind of. But you're not sure what it
actually is.

950
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:36,778
LAURA: I wonder if this was holding that acid.

951
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:40,660
TALIESIN: I wonder if something very, very hot...

952
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:43,585
MARISHA: I'm wondering if it's a symptom of
something.

953
01:05:43,585 --> 01:05:46,643
SAM: When they burn the whitestone with the acid
or something?

954
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,090
LAURA: Do I see any recent tracks around here?
Does it look like people came down here?

955
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:56,947
MATT: Make a survival check with advantage because
you're a crazy ranger tracker.

956
01:05:56,947 --> 01:06:04,158
LAURA: 13.

957
01:06:04,158 --> 01:06:10,468
MATT: You see tracks here and there, some fresher
than others. Yeah.

958
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:12,158
LIAM: How many of us found this?

959
01:06:12,158 --> 01:06:15,200
MATT: Well, two of you saw it.

960
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,415
LIAM: I've got one.

961
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:17,566
MATT: Yeah, you've got one piece.

962
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:18,520
LIAM: And Percy's got the other?

963
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,004
MATT: Second piece, yeah.

964
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:21,419
SAM: You want to burn one?

965
01:06:21,419 --> 01:06:25,155
LIAM: I walk away from the group all the way to
the back, and I take it--

966
01:06:25,155 --> 01:06:27,548
MATT: To where you came from?

967
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:33,918
LIAM: Yeah, towards where we came from. What's
behind us? Is it just tunnel back that way?

968
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:37,641
MATT: You mean on that path you're going?

969
01:06:37,641 --> 01:06:39,687
LIAM: Yeah, I push through the back of the group
to the back.

970
01:06:39,687 --> 01:06:40,579
MATT: Okay.

971
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,919
LIAM: What's behind us?

972
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:43,988
MATT: Where you just came from is the stairs that
lead up to the castle.

973
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:47,950
LIAM: I was going to throw it, but...

974
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,372
TRAVIS: I see Vex looking around. Can I look for
tracks as well? I'm proficient in survival, and I

975
01:06:52,372 --> 01:06:53,645
never use it.

976
01:06:53,645 --> 01:06:57,109
MATT: Sure.

977
01:06:57,109 --> 01:07:00,408
TRAVIS: Natural 20! I swear to god.

978
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:03,927
MATT: While you sit there inspecting the dirt--

979
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:07,424
LAURA: It looks like there's some tracks here, but
I don't know what it's saying.

980
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:15,789
MATT: Grog, you immediately see a cluster of
recent footprints, probably a day old at most,

981
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:28,025
that lead in towards the tunnel. Looks like the
prints are of seven individuals. Feet are fairly

982
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:35,098
wide, masculine and heavy in step. One gait
appears to be smaller, thinner, and more

983
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:36,389
feminine.

984
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:38,673
TRAVIS: How many tombs are open around us?

985
01:07:38,673 --> 01:07:45,092
MATT: Eight total in this room.

986
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:47,505
TRAVIS: Should we check the tombs?

987
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:49,043
LAURA: They're already open and empty.

988
01:07:49,043 --> 01:07:50,532
SAM: They're open and empty.

989
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:52,142
MATT: You all make a perception check.

990
01:07:52,142 --> 01:07:53,558
MARISHA: All of us?

991
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:56,595
SAM: Ten.

992
01:07:56,595 --> 01:07:58,119
MARISHA: 28.

993
01:07:58,119 --> 01:07:59,418
TALIESIN: 25.

994
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:00,618
LIAM: 20.

995
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,903
LAURA: 11.

996
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:03,403
TRAVIS: 18.

997
01:08:03,403 --> 01:08:05,186
MATT: Okay, 20 and above that'd be just you two?

998
01:08:05,186 --> 01:08:06,278
LIAM: 20.

999
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:12,978
MATT: Oh, yeah, three. All right, so you three,
you notice the temperature drop ever so slightly

1000
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:20,768
in the room and in the darkened shadow. you look
around and you see what appears to be some sort of

1001
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:23,061
ethereal mass drifting away.

1002
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:24,162
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1003
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,481
MARISHA: God damn it! Here we go again.

1004
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:26,597
LIAM: We've got company.

1005
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:29,705
MATT: There's one round that you three get to act.
The rest of you have a surprise round right now.

1006
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,996
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

1007
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:35,220
SAM: Bad deadly ghost mist.

1008
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,782
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

1009
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:38,145
SAM: A miasma.

1010
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:45,773
MATT: Grog and Vex are out here checking this. You
guys are back here. Keyleth is here. Vax, you're

1011
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:51,622
back here. Trinket's up with you, and Scanlan
you're--

1012
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:52,897
SAM: I was in the back.

1013
01:08:52,897 --> 01:09:07,187
MATT: So you're over here with these guys. You see
one drifts out from this side, another drifts out

1014
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:10,431
from this side, and another drifts in from this
side.

1015
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:13,432
MARISHA: Undead ghoulie guys?

1016
01:09:13,432 --> 01:09:14,779
LIAM: Ghosts. Wraiths.

1017
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:16,140
MARISHA: Wraiths?

1018
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:23,207
MATT: There is a cold chill that runs down the
spine of Keyleth and Vax, as they've encountered

1019
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:25,412
enemies similar to this in the past.

1020
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,774
MARISHA: It's that fucking shit that turned us.

1021
01:09:27,774 --> 01:09:33,178
MATT: All right, let's roll some initiatives.

1022
01:09:33,178 --> 01:09:36,656
TRAVIS: Just those three, right?

1023
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:37,934
MATT: Just those three.

1024
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:39,509
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

1025
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,683
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

1026
01:09:40,683 --> 01:09:42,022
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

1027
01:09:42,022 --> 01:09:42,897
MARISHA: Get out!

1028
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:45,430
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice. This is bullshit.

1029
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,508
MATT: Yeah, I'm banning that d20 for the rest of
the game.

1030
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:48,734
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice.

1031
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:55,176
MARISHA: It makes no sense. Yes! It's a hollow
die.

1032
01:09:55,176 --> 01:10:00,495
TALIESIN: It's a hollow die. There's nothing to be
weighted on it. It's a wiffle die.

1033
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:02,308
MARISHA: And I rolled a one!

1034
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:06,696
MATT: So it's just you. Okay, so! Initiatives.

1035
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:08,785
TALIESIN: 28.

1036
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:11,217
MATT: (giggles) Okay.

1037
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:12,274
MARISHA: 14.

1038
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:13,309
MATT: Okay.

1039
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:14,125
LIAM: 15.

1040
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,221
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

1041
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:18,893
MARISHA: (laughing) I can't believe I did that.
Rolled a one on it.

1042
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:23,727
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up first. You
glance around, and you can see the two entities

1043
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:29,490
going (hiss) towards you, towards Keyleth, and you
glance over your shoulder and see one drifting out

1044
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,133
of the distance towards Vax.

1045
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:37,133
TALIESIN: I yell, "Look out!" And I take several
steps toward Vax.

1046
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:42,126
MATT: To there?

1047
01:10:42,126 --> 01:10:45,638
TALIESIN: Actually, on the other side of the
pillar so I can actually see the one that's

1048
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:46,938
getting towards him.

1049
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:47,956
MATT: There?

1050
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:48,622
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1051
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:51,423
MATT: You won't be able to see this one, just
those. This one actually will block your view to

1052
01:10:51,423 --> 01:10:57,295
that one. These are about ten feet tall. These are
the little sections here, so right now, you would

1053
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:04,723
be able to see these two here and barely see this
one. It would have three-quarters cover. Which you

1054
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:05,848
ignore, with Sharpshooter.

1055
01:11:05,848 --> 01:11:10,326
TALIESIN: I know. I want to back up into that
corner, though, just to get away from them.

1056
01:11:10,326 --> 01:11:11,380
MATT: Over here?

1057
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,289
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1058
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:14,712
MATT: Okay, so you can see one of them right now.

1059
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:23,292
TALIESIN: I'll take-- fuck. Yep, screw it. I'll
take shots with the Pepperbox.

1060
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:24,567
MATT: Okay.

1061
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:25,846
TALIESIN: I'll take my first shot.

1062
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,022
MATT: Go for it.

1063
01:11:27,022 --> 01:11:32,017
TALIESIN: That can't be right. Just checking. 20.
Natural 20.

1064
01:11:32,017 --> 01:11:32,926
MATT: Okay.

1065
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:33,838
LAURA: With a different dice?

1066
01:11:33,838 --> 01:11:36,178
TALIESIN: With a different die. Of course, with a
different die.

1067
01:11:36,178 --> 01:11:37,488
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

1068
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:39,050
TRAVIS: Who are you?

1069
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:44,480
TALIESIN: I'm the devil. I am the devil, and I
have come to do the devil's work.

1070
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,995
MATT: So all of you who are going to conventions
to meet Taliesin in the future, make sure you get

1071
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:51,082
a nice long hold of his hand so you can roll
better, too.

1072
01:11:51,082 --> 01:11:52,232
TRAVIS: Yeah, would you touch my dice?

1073
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:55,798
TALIESIN: I will lick your die, because that is
how I bless them.

1074
01:11:55,798 --> 01:12:01,077
MATT: All right, so that's your first attack.
Second attack?

1075
01:12:01,077 --> 01:12:02,316
TALIESIN: First attack.

1076
01:12:02,316 --> 01:12:03,698
MATT: Both at the same guy?

1077
01:12:03,698 --> 01:12:07,882
TALIESIN: Yeah, all against the same guy.

1078
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:09,190
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1079
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:14,774
TALIESIN: First attack is 22 points of damage.

1080
01:12:14,774 --> 01:12:16,710
MATT: Okay, is this with the element, or not?

1081
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:17,788
TALIESIN: No, no element.

1082
01:12:17,788 --> 01:12:20,557
MATT: Okay. You fire. Just passes through it with
no effect.

1083
01:12:20,557 --> 01:12:24,396
MARISHA: Yeah, fucking misty dudes.

1084
01:12:24,396 --> 01:12:25,624
TRAVIS: What?

1085
01:12:25,624 --> 01:12:28,788
MARISHA: Damn misty dudes. I'm mocking them.

1086
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:30,199
TALIESIN: I spin.

1087
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:31,154
MATT: Okay.

1088
01:12:31,154 --> 01:12:34,320
TALIESIN: Shoot with fire.

1089
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,866
MATT: Okay.

1090
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,598
TALIESIN: What the fuck?!

1091
01:12:38,598 --> 01:12:41,109
MARISHA: Get out!

1092
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:42,834
MATT: Take a picture. Take a picture right now.

1093
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:43,938
TALIESIN: Taking a picture.

1094
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:45,084
MARISHA: Get out! You're the anti-Wheaton.

1095
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:46,265
SAM: He's had, like, eight tonight.

1096
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:47,208
MARISHA: How many is that?

1097
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,579
TALIESIN: I don't know!

1098
01:12:48,579 --> 01:12:53,093
MARISHA: CritRoleStats, how many is that? Tell us!
I know you've been counting.

1099
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:54,911
LAURA: Ridiculous.

1100
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:57,686
SAM: Go to Vegas!

1101
01:12:57,686 --> 01:12:59,087
TALIESIN: I'll put it on Instagram later.

1102
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,518
MARISHA: Go to Vegas!

1103
01:13:00,518 --> 01:13:01,518
LAURA: Yeah.

1104
01:13:01,518 --> 01:13:03,297
TALIESIN: I go to Vegas. I don't gamble!

1105
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:04,397
LAURA: We need to go.

1106
01:13:04,397 --> 01:13:07,127
MATT: You need to go find the D&amp;D casino.

1107
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:09,682
SAM: D&amp;D casino?

1108
01:13:09,682 --> 01:13:11,995
MATT: D&amp;D casino. Make it happen, guys. I know one
of you can.

1109
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:13,077
TALIESIN: All right.

1110
01:13:13,077 --> 01:13:15,143
MATT: So which one is this?

1111
01:13:15,143 --> 01:13:17,894
TALIESIN: This is fire elemental.

1112
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:18,790
MATT: Okay.

1113
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:27,721
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage, plus three
damage of fire.

1114
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:29,259
MATT: That's including crit damage?

1115
01:13:29,259 --> 01:13:32,032
TALIESIN: Including the crit damage. I rolled
really poorly on my damage.

1116
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:36,997
MATT: Okay, so this one, the bullet does (impact
noise) hit its form with a burst of flame, the

1117
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:42,455
bullet converted to magical due to the nature of
the chamber. You can see its form (raspy cry). It

1118
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:45,727
disperses for a second and then re-forms,
continuing its movement.

1119
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,486
TALIESIN: We need magic! I'm taking my last
shot.

1120
01:13:47,486 --> 01:13:48,511
MATT: Okay.

1121
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:52,131
MARISHA: That was seven, by the way. Seven 20s
this game.

1122
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:53,635
MATT: That's stupid.

1123
01:13:53,635 --> 01:13:57,078
TALIESIN: Okay, see? That's better. 15.

1124
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:58,892
MATT: 15 does hit.

1125
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:08,686
TALIESIN: All right. They're easy to hit, at
least. That's such a shitty roll. 12 points of ice

1126
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:09,690
damage.

1127
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:16,731
MATT: Okay. The ice shot (gunshot) tears through
it, doing additional damage. You see part of its

1128
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:20,102
form crystallize from the little bit of ectoplasm
that's floating in the air, but it's not enough to

1129
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:28,142
actually disperse its form. It continues pushing
forward. You would have to reload to use those

1130
01:14:28,142 --> 01:14:29,112
again.

1131
01:14:29,112 --> 01:14:30,345
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out.

1132
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:36,856
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. It's now their
go. This one drifts forward to Keyleth. This one

1133
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:38,890
drifts forward to Grog.

1134
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,199
MARISHA: That's with our surprise round? You said
we have a surprise round.

1135
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,977
MATT: No, you guys were aware. Everyone else is
surprised.

1136
01:14:44,977 --> 01:14:49,899
MARISHA: Oh, we're the only three that aren't
surprised. Oh, that sucks.

1137
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:54,710
MATT: So. Unless you do anything against
surprise?

1138
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:56,205
TRAVIS: Not unless I'm raging.

1139
01:14:56,205 --> 01:15:06,471
MATT: That's true. All right. Keyleth, I need you
to make a constitution saving throw. Sorry, no, a

1140
01:15:06,471 --> 01:15:07,848
charisma saving throw.

1141
01:15:07,848 --> 01:15:13,941
MARISHA: A charisma saving throw? That's not
great. And no saving throw bonuses, okay, so

1142
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:15,381
that's ten?

1143
01:15:15,381 --> 01:15:17,672
LIAM: (quietly) Oh, she's gone.

1144
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:19,880
MARISHA: We've been here before.

1145
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,419
MATT: Did you roll already?

1146
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:22,620
MARISHA: I did.

1147
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,741
MATT: What did you get?

1148
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:24,747
MARISHA: Ten.

1149
01:15:24,747 --> 01:15:35,326
MATT: Ten. Okay. The ghost reaches out and
embraces Keyleth. It disappears into her form and

1150
01:15:35,362 --> 01:15:38,827
she shivers for a second, and it is no longer
visible.

1151
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:40,887
LAURA: Oh, he's taken over her body?

1152
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:45,252
MATT: Keyleth's eyes all of a sudden flare up with
a ghostly blue glow, and she turns around, looking

1153
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:53,941
at the group with a hunger you haven't seen in her
eyes. For those who see it, as well-- I should

1154
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:57,734
have made this happen before-- I need you guys to
immediately after seeing these ghosts make a

1155
01:15:57,734 --> 01:15:58,999
wisdom saving throw.

1156
01:15:58,999 --> 01:15:59,934
TALIESIN: What for?

1157
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:00,777
SAM: Everyone?

1158
01:16:00,777 --> 01:16:01,870
MATT: No, just the ones that see it.

1159
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,595
LAURA: We're all immune to fear because of the
feast.

1160
01:16:04,595 --> 01:16:06,861
MATT: That's right, so never mind. That doesn't
matter.

1161
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:08,507
SAM: (laughs) Yeah!

1162
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:13,967
MATT: Good reminding. So I was right, then. I
didn't forget anything! All right,

1163
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:15,674
charisma saving throw?

1164
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:17,805
LIAM: Charisma saving throw?

1165
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:18,798
MATT: Correct.

1166
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:19,746
LIAM: Okay.

1167
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:20,988
MARISHA: This isn't a charm thing?

1168
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:22,670
MATT: And Grog, charisma saving throw.

1169
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:23,640
LAURA: Is this charm?

1170
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,382
MATT: Nope. This is not a charm.

1171
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:32,318
LIAM: Okay, so a 12 for me. Am I caught, as well?

1172
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:33,319
SAM: 12?

1173
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:34,228
MATT: 12?

1174
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:35,067
LIAM: Yeah.

1175
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:35,964
MATT: Okay.

1176
01:16:35,964 --> 01:16:39,213
TALIESIN: God damn it.

1177
01:16:39,213 --> 01:16:41,026
SAM: That was your last Luck, too.

1178
01:16:41,026 --> 01:16:42,795
LIAM: No, that's two, isn't it?

1179
01:16:42,795 --> 01:16:44,115
MARISHA: You did two.

1180
01:16:44,115 --> 01:16:45,905
LAURA: We're going to die!

1181
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:47,906
TRAVIS: Grog is batting for the other team.

1182
01:16:47,906 --> 01:16:49,378
MATT: What did you roll?

1183
01:16:49,378 --> 01:16:50,460
TRAVIS: Four.

1184
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,272
LAURA: (muffled) We don't even have a cleric with
us!

1185
01:16:54,272 --> 01:16:57,049
SAM: Wait, this is against charisma?

1186
01:16:57,049 --> 01:16:58,347
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

1187
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,449
SAM: Jesus.

1188
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:06,422
MATT: And with that, three of your teammates turn
around, their eyes intensely glowing with some

1189
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:09,385
sort of a weird ghostly glow.

1190
01:17:09,385 --> 01:17:13,124
MARISHA: Three v three, man. Battle royale. Let's
do this.

1191
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:14,426
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1192
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,508
SAM: Wait, we have to fight them?

1193
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,870
MARISHA: He's going to call it at eight. He's
going to call it.

1194
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:20,614
MATT: Everyone else roll initiative.

1195
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:23,537
SAM: We have to fight them. How is that going to
happen?

1196
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:25,531
TALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.

1197
01:17:25,531 --> 01:17:27,726
TRAVIS: Not us. Not the possessed ones, right?

1198
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,080
MATT: No, you guys are already on the initiative.
Oh, no. Grog, you still do.

1199
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,454
TRAVIS: I still roll initiative?

1200
01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:33,654
MATT: Yeah, for yourself.

1201
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,121
LAURA: What?

1202
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:37,305
TRAVIS: I'm possessed, though.

1203
01:17:37,305 --> 01:17:45,155
TALIESIN: Roll your initiative.

1204
01:17:45,155 --> 01:17:46,521
LIAM: What just happened?

1205
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:49,479
LAURA: You have to roll initiative to see when you
attack all of us.

1206
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:50,528
MATT: Yeah.

1207
01:17:50,528 --> 01:17:52,263
TRAVIS: Well, then it's good it was a one.

1208
01:17:52,263 --> 01:17:54,226
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1209
01:17:54,226 --> 01:17:56,566
MARISHA: Do we roll initiative, too? We're
re-rolling initiative, the three of us?

1210
01:17:56,566 --> 01:18:00,358
MATT: Everyone who hasn't rolled yet rolls now.

1211
01:18:00,358 --> 01:18:01,449
MARISHA: Oh.

1212
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:02,540
SAM: 15.

1213
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,706
MATT: 15. Okay.

1214
01:18:03,706 --> 01:18:05,069
TRAVIS: Unless I have to roll with advantage.

1215
01:18:05,069 --> 01:18:07,535
SAM: Do you have to roll with advantage?

1216
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:10,724
MATT: Technically, you would, yeah.

1217
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:12,028
TRAVIS: Two.

1218
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:14,454
MATT: All right, and what did you get?

1219
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:15,291
LAURA: 13.

1220
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:19,675
MATT: 13. All right. Percy, you're up first.

1221
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:24,195
MARISHA: Help us!

1222
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:26,251
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

1223
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:28,029
LAURA: We don't have a cleric!

1224
01:18:28,029 --> 01:18:30,936
SAM: You have-- ugh.

1225
01:18:30,936 --> 01:18:32,481
MARISHA: I think you guys--

1226
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:35,254
SAM: No, it's up to us to figure out, right?

1227
01:18:35,254 --> 01:18:37,450
LAURA: He cast Turn Undead. We don't have that.

1228
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,917
MARISHA: Was that when Kashaw was here?

1229
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:39,733
LAURA: Yeah.

1230
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:41,852
MARISHA: That was Kashaw. Yeah, he cast Turn
Undead.

1231
01:18:41,852 --> 01:18:43,725
TRAVIS: Awesome. He's not here right now. What are
you going to do?

1232
01:18:43,725 --> 01:18:44,952
TALIESIN: Okay! What are we going to do?

1233
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:46,508
MATT: What are you going to do?

1234
01:18:46,508 --> 01:18:53,298
TALIESIN: (sighs) All right, who's the most
dangerous?

1235
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:54,970
TRAVIS: Does Cassandra have any--

1236
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:59,665
TALIESIN: That's my first action. I'm going to use
my bonus action to turn to my sister and go, what

1237
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:01,740
the hell do we do?

1238
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:08,049
MATT: She looks at you, a little bit frustrated.

1239
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:14,886
MARISHA: Please tell me she trained in cleric.
Please tell me she multiclassed.

1240
01:19:14,886 --> 01:19:28,657
MATT: She looks about, annoyed, and goes, "I'm
sorry. I'm not a holy woman. I have no symbols. I

1241
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:31,461
"have no power. I have nothing. Let's see what we
can do."

1242
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:35,095
TALIESIN: All right. I'm--

1243
01:19:35,095 --> 01:19:38,572
MARISHA: You guys have that holy water, right?

1244
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:43,885
TALIESIN: I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best
to back up into the tomb right here.

1245
01:19:43,885 --> 01:19:45,310
MATT: Right there?

1246
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:51,220
TALIESIN: Keep going to my right until the
drop-off behind me, and I'm going to back up into

1247
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,301
the tomb.

1248
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:54,104
MATT: Okay. Into there?

1249
01:19:54,104 --> 01:19:57,152
TALIESIN: No, up. Towards you; the other side.

1250
01:19:57,152 --> 01:19:58,148
MATT: There we go.

1251
01:19:58,148 --> 01:19:59,868
TALIESIN: There we go. I'm putting my back against
the wall.

1252
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:01,505
MATT: Okay, so you're up against the stone?

1253
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:02,546
TALIESIN: I mean that column.

1254
01:20:02,546 --> 01:20:04,705
MARISHA: Take the damn laser pointer.

1255
01:20:04,705 --> 01:20:06,145
TALIESIN: Yeah, there.

1256
01:20:06,145 --> 01:20:07,182
MATT: There you go.

1257
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:08,197
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1258
01:20:08,197 --> 01:20:09,411
MATT: All right.

1259
01:20:09,411 --> 01:20:15,300
TALIESIN: I'm unloading two shots. I'm reloading
and unloading two magical shots at Vax.

1260
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,827
MATT: Okay.

1261
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:31,573
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn some fucking points.
What am I going to do?

1262
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:35,200
SAM: We're fucked!

1263
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,052
TRAVIS: Do your worst.

1264
01:20:37,052 --> 01:20:44,555
TALIESIN: First shot-- fuck it, I'm using the old
die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one.

1265
01:20:44,555 --> 01:20:51,843
First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his
knives.

1266
01:20:51,843 --> 01:20:53,309
MATT: Okay.

1267
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:55,225
TALIESIN: Burning a grit point to drop his knife.

1268
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,430
MARISHA: Good idea!

1269
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:57,861
MATT: He has two, so you only knock--

1270
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:01,732
TALIESIN: One of them out of his hand. The one
that doesn't auto-return.

1271
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,669
LIAM: They all do.

1272
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:04,697
TALIESIN: They all do?

1273
01:21:04,697 --> 01:21:05,538
LIAM: Yeah.

1274
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:08,225
MATT: That crazy belt, man.

1275
01:21:08,225 --> 01:21:15,247
TALIESIN: Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And
my gun jams. You did that!

1276
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,810
MARISHA: I touched it. I'm sorry!

1277
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:22,678
MATT: (laughs) You turn around and holding your
gun out at Vax, even with this ghostly form, it's

1278
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:27,307
so hard to do so, and you close your eyes for a
second and you pull the trigger, and in a weird

1279
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:34,546
way you're both immediately distraught and at the
same time relieved that the gun jammed.

1280
01:21:34,546 --> 01:21:35,605
(mechanical noise)

1281
01:21:35,605 --> 01:21:36,948
TALIESIN: (frustrated noise)

1282
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:38,088
MATT: So that's your turn.

1283
01:21:38,088 --> 01:21:38,987
TALIESIN: Yep.

1284
01:21:38,987 --> 01:21:53,085
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up first. The ghost
drives you to turn up to him as he's trying to fix

1285
01:21:53,085 --> 01:22:00,037
the gun. Daggers out. Go ahead and make your two
attacks against him. No sneak attack damage.

1286
01:22:00,037 --> 01:22:06,160
LIAM: The first was a 13. The second was a 22.

1287
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,700
MATT: Pretty sure the 22 hits.

1288
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,607
TALIESIN: 22 hits.

1289
01:22:08,607 --> 01:22:11,081
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage against
Percy.

1290
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:13,955
LIAM: Eight.

1291
01:22:13,955 --> 01:22:19,923
MATT: All right, so you take eight points of
piercing damage. You feel the blade (pained cry)

1292
01:22:19,923 --> 01:22:23,518
pierce into the side. It doesn't get too far in,
but you haven't been on the receiving end of his

1293
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:28,713
daggers before, and it's not fun seeing what they
do to others. All right, at the end of your turn,

1294
01:22:28,713 --> 01:22:36,440
I want you to make a religion check.

1295
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:38,584
SAM: Check?

1296
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:39,936
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

1297
01:22:39,936 --> 01:22:41,148
MARISHA: Come on.

1298
01:22:41,148 --> 01:22:43,181
TALIESIN: Magic fingers.

1299
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:44,410
LAURA: Magic glove.

1300
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:46,063
MARISHA: Do you want Taliesin to lick it?

1301
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:48,317
LIAM: 18.

1302
01:22:48,317 --> 01:22:56,254
MATT: 18? That gentle glow left behind, that
slight sliver of Pike's essence that went into

1303
01:22:56,254 --> 01:23:04,812
your symbol of Sarenrae, flares for a second. It
flares again, and for a moment, in your head, in

1304
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:08,257
which darkness has taken your vision, you feel
your body moving on its own, but you have no

1305
01:23:08,257 --> 01:23:15,873
control. You hear Pike's voice whisper in your ear
from a distance. It says, "Vax? It's okay." At

1306
01:23:15,873 --> 01:23:21,277
which point, suddenly you feel the coldness sucked
out from you. The symbol flares for a second, and

1307
01:23:21,277 --> 01:23:23,519
the ghost is thrust out of your form.

1308
01:23:23,519 --> 01:23:24,775
MARISHA: (excited shout)

1309
01:23:24,775 --> 01:23:26,274
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1310
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:34,046
MATT: That is your turn, however. All right.
Scanlan, you're up.

1311
01:23:34,046 --> 01:23:52,045
SAM: I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call
them forth to protect us in this moment.

1312
01:23:52,045 --> 01:23:54,555
TALIESIN: Treguna mekoides--

1313
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:55,857
SAM: Hakuna matata.

1314
01:23:55,857 --> 01:23:57,697
TALIESIN: Trecorum satis dee.

1315
01:23:57,697 --> 01:23:59,853
SAM: I don't know how this works.

1316
01:23:59,853 --> 01:24:01,832
(laughter)

1317
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:03,341
MATT: That's okay.

1318
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:10,887
SAM: (silly voice) They attack bad things around
me, and they don't like bad things, so I thought

1319
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:12,336
maybe that would be good.

1320
01:24:12,336 --> 01:24:14,463
(laughter)

1321
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:25,029
SAM: Spirit Guardians. The thing I bought from
Gilmore. Right? Didn't I buy the Scroll of Spirit

1322
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:26,369
Guardians?

1323
01:24:26,369 --> 01:24:27,972
LAURA: Yeah, you did.

1324
01:24:27,972 --> 01:24:32,614
SAM: They attack anything evil within 15 feet of
me.

1325
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:34,468
MATT: Indeed.

1326
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:39,277
SAM: Necrotic damage.

1327
01:24:39,277 --> 01:24:45,453
MATT: There we go: Spirit Guardians. So you call
forth spirits to protect you for the duration, for

1328
01:24:45,453 --> 01:24:50,956
up to ten minutes. Your alignment is...?

1329
01:24:50,956 --> 01:24:52,163
SAM: Good?

1330
01:24:52,163 --> 01:24:53,122
MATT: Good, yeah.

1331
01:24:53,122 --> 01:25:02,212
SAM: Good-ish. Sort of devious good.

1332
01:25:02,212 --> 01:25:09,145
MATT: Okay, so here's what you do. You actually
use this to create these guardians-- this spell

1333
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:13,289
hasn't been used, either. To a distance of 15
feet. You have to choose things within 15 feet of

1334
01:25:13,289 --> 01:25:14,829
you, so you have these two right here.

1335
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:17,193
SAM: They're both within 15 feet of me, aren't
they?

1336
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:22,579
MATT: So, these guys. Their speed is halved.

1337
01:25:22,579 --> 01:25:30,047
SAM: When they take their turn, they get 3d8
damage.

1338
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,704
MATT: Yeah.

1339
01:25:31,704 --> 01:25:37,580
SAM: It's a very confusing spell.

1340
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:43,612
MATT: Yeah, when they move within 15 feet of you,
their speed is halved, and at the start or when

1341
01:25:43,612 --> 01:25:46,445
they enter the area, they make a wisdom saving
throw or take radiant damage.

1342
01:25:46,445 --> 01:25:47,846
SAM: Is that now or when they move?

1343
01:25:47,846 --> 01:25:49,573
MATT: That will be at the end of their turn.

1344
01:25:49,573 --> 01:25:51,691
TALIESIN: Yay, radiant damage. That's awesome.

1345
01:25:51,691 --> 01:25:52,879
SAM: I know.

1346
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:54,957
TALIESIN: You made a good call.

1347
01:25:54,957 --> 01:25:55,987
TRAVIS: Nice, dude.

1348
01:25:55,987 --> 01:26:01,750
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?

1349
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,388
SAM: Do I get a bonus action?

1350
01:26:03,388 --> 01:26:05,467
MATT: You get a bonus action, yes.

1351
01:26:05,467 --> 01:26:14,100
SAM: Okay. Who's not undead right now? You? I've
already inspired you once. Sure, I'll inspire you

1352
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:23,226
again. I've got nothing. This time, I'll just go,
(harmonica noises).

1353
01:26:23,226 --> 01:26:25,691
LAURA: I feel really inspired.

1354
01:26:25,691 --> 01:26:30,891
MATT: Take the lamest d10 you've ever accepted,
because harmonica's not your favorite instrument.

1355
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:41,218
All righty. Great. That brings us to Keyleth's
turn.

1356
01:26:41,218 --> 01:26:48,358
TALIESIN: (squeaking noise)

1357
01:26:48,358 --> 01:26:51,859
MARISHA: Did you just squeak?

1358
01:26:51,859 --> 01:26:55,940
TALIESIN: Maybe. You don't know. Shut up!

1359
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:02,487
MATT: So it turns towards Scanlan, having cast
that, and you make a staff attack against him.

1360
01:27:02,487 --> 01:27:04,383
MARISHA: (grunts)

1361
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:16,559
SAM: I do a little doo-wop. (vocalizes) And that's
my Cutting Words to try to distract her from her

1362
01:27:16,559 --> 01:27:17,418
attack.

1363
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:18,938
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1364
01:27:18,938 --> 01:27:20,015
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

1365
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:21,061
SAM: Do I roll now?

1366
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:23,486
MATT: Yeah, you roll a d10 and subtract that from
her attack.

1367
01:27:23,486 --> 01:27:24,553
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

1368
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:26,582
SAM: Two.

1369
01:27:26,582 --> 01:27:28,024
MATT: So it's a 17.

1370
01:27:28,024 --> 01:27:29,157
MARISHA: What's your AC?

1371
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:31,020
SAM: I have a 17 armor class.

1372
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,560
MATT: Roll damage.

1373
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,691
SAM: Oh, wait! No, that's a ten. That's right.

1374
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:42,675
MARISHA: It's not a lot of damage, I promise. Oh,
see? Even better. Four damage.

1375
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:45,158
SAM: Oh. I shouldn't have even wasted it.

1376
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:46,138
TALIESIN: It's "ow."

1377
01:27:46,138 --> 01:27:48,218
LAURA: It's just your little staff?

1378
01:27:48,218 --> 01:27:50,309
SAM: You're adorable.

1379
01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:51,785
MARISHA: I'm still doing my granny routine.

1380
01:27:51,785 --> 01:28:02,289
MATT: Okay, now it has to make a wisdom saving
throw, which it succeeds. It still takes half as

1381
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:04,756
much damage, so roll 3d8.

1382
01:28:04,756 --> 01:28:05,809
SAM: Who, me?

1383
01:28:05,809 --> 01:28:06,681
MATT: Yes.

1384
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:15,041
SAM: Oh. Yes. Of course I will. I will do that
right now with these d8s that I have. 12.

1385
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:28,227
MATT: Okay. All righty. So this burst of radiant
energy burns around her. You take 12 points of

1386
01:28:28,227 --> 01:28:29,245
radiant damage.

1387
01:28:29,245 --> 01:28:33,106
MARISHA: 12 points?

1388
01:28:33,106 --> 01:28:37,337
MATT: Yep. Vex, you're up.

1389
01:28:37,337 --> 01:28:39,731
LAURA: All right.

1390
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,782
MATT: You see Grog turn to you with this wicked
grin on his face, eyes glowing a pale whitish-blue

1391
01:28:43,782 --> 01:28:46,005
as he brings the hammer up in the air.

1392
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:51,484
LAURA: Oh god! Am I close by him?

1393
01:28:51,484 --> 01:28:53,878
MATT: You are. You're right next to him.

1394
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:55,248
LAURA: I'm right next to him?

1395
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:56,440
MATT: You're right there.

1396
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:03,507
LAURA: Oh no! I back away from him. He's going to
get an attack on me.

1397
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:04,551
MATT: Yep.

1398
01:29:04,551 --> 01:29:06,613
LAURA: But I really needed to put some distance
there.

1399
01:29:06,613 --> 01:29:08,311
MATT: Make an attack of opportunity.

1400
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:10,659
LAURA: Wait! Okay, that's good.

1401
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:13,271
TRAVIS: 13.

1402
01:29:13,271 --> 01:29:14,654
LAURA: You don't hit me!

1403
01:29:14,654 --> 01:29:19,711
MATT: Whiff. (impact noise) The hammer hits the
side of the stonework, cracking it a little.

1404
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:20,985
TALIESIN: Oh, that's my mausoleum.

1405
01:29:20,985 --> 01:29:23,174
MATT: What are you doing, Vex?

1406
01:29:23,174 --> 01:29:30,621
LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket-- is he lined up
with anybody?

1407
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:34,523
MATT: Just Keyleth right now.

1408
01:29:34,523 --> 01:29:37,706
LAURA: He can't cannonball through to Grog and
Keyleth?

1409
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:40,105
MATT: He can, but he'll hit Scanlan, as well.

1410
01:29:40,105 --> 01:29:42,205
LAURA: Can you dodge, Scanlan?

1411
01:29:42,205 --> 01:29:47,092
SAM: We'll see. Let's do this. I always loved that
bear.

1412
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:50,219
LAURA: Right! You deserve it. He's doing it.

1413
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:58,407
MATT: We'll say Trinket backs up a little bit to
get enough room on it. Keyleth, swing an attack.

1414
01:29:58,407 --> 01:30:01,083
MARISHA: Oh, to Trinket?

1415
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:04,148
MATT: Yeah. Trinket has to get enough distance to
actually build up momentum.

1416
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:05,845
MARISHA: Oh, I think that hits. 20 total?

1417
01:30:05,845 --> 01:30:08,804
MATT: 20 total is exactly the AC. Roll damage for
Trinket.

1418
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:11,321
MARISHA: It's okay. It's not a lot. Nine?

1419
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:13,628
MATT: Trinket takes nine points of bludgeoning
damage from the staff.

1420
01:30:13,628 --> 01:30:14,669
LAURA: Halved?

1421
01:30:14,669 --> 01:30:22,287
MATT: Right, yeah, because it's bludgeoning, so
five points. Trinket then rolls forward, (thudding

1422
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:27,928
noises). Roll attacks on Grog, Scanlan, and
Keyleth.

1423
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:30,639
MARISHA: Trinket bowling.

1424
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:40,984
LAURA: Eight plus 16 is 24.

1425
01:30:40,984 --> 01:30:45,656
MATT: For who? Keyleth, Scanlan, and Grog.

1426
01:30:45,656 --> 01:30:47,646
LAURA: Okay, so Keyleth is 24.

1427
01:30:47,646 --> 01:30:48,718
MARISHA: Hits.

1428
01:30:48,718 --> 01:30:50,724
LAURA: Scanlan is 18.

1429
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:51,528
SAM: Hits.

1430
01:30:51,528 --> 01:30:52,945
LAURA: And Grog is 18.

1431
01:30:52,945 --> 01:30:54,084
TRAVIS: Misses.

1432
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,585
LAURA: No, Grog is 20.

1433
01:30:55,585 --> 01:30:56,704
TRAVIS: Hits.

1434
01:30:56,704 --> 01:31:02,086
MATT: All three hit? All right, so no attacks of
opportunity against Trinket. Roll damage, and

1435
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:03,479
everyone takes that damage.

1436
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:06,982
LAURA: I don't know what to roll for cannonball
damage because I've never actually gotten to hit.

1437
01:31:06,982 --> 01:31:09,235
MATT: Oh, I know. I have this. It's 2d6 plus
four.

1438
01:31:09,235 --> 01:31:13,088
LAURA: Okay. For each person?

1439
01:31:13,088 --> 01:31:13,978
MATT: Yep.

1440
01:31:13,978 --> 01:31:18,517
LAURA: Oh, okay, so ten for Keyleth.

1441
01:31:18,517 --> 01:31:20,417
MATT: Ten points of bludgeoning damage.

1442
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:24,906
LAURA: Seven plus four is 11 for Scanlan.

1443
01:31:24,906 --> 01:31:25,890
SAM: Okay.

1444
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:29,772
LAURA: Oh, less for Grog. Eight.

1445
01:31:29,772 --> 01:31:31,242
MATT: Eight points of damage for Grog.

1446
01:31:31,242 --> 01:31:36,739
LAURA: And while he's doing-- I don't get to shoot
an arrow. Yes, I do! I get to shoot an arrow.

1447
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:37,611
MATT: Bonus.

1448
01:31:37,611 --> 01:31:41,322
LAURA: I'm going to shoot an arrow as Trinket is
hitting Grog.

1449
01:31:41,322 --> 01:31:42,254
MATT: Okay.

1450
01:31:42,254 --> 01:31:50,546
LAURA: Oh god. 14 doesn't hit him.

1451
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:56,490
MATT: Nope. It hits the shoulder and gleans off
and carves a little wound across his chest, but not

1452
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:01,488
enough to do any damage. That ends your turn.
Grog.

1453
01:32:01,535 --> 01:32:04,750
LAURA: And now Trinket is close to me, then. Did
he go through them and get back to me?

1454
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:07,526
MATT: Trinket, due to the line, slams into Grog at
the end of it, so he is now between the three

1455
01:32:07,526 --> 01:32:08,461
others.

1456
01:32:08,461 --> 01:32:09,594
LAURA: Shit.

1457
01:32:09,594 --> 01:32:20,051
MATT: Grog. As a ghost, you just got shot and
slammed by a bear. I want you to roll one d20.

1458
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:22,438
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to see if he raged.

1459
01:32:22,438 --> 01:32:25,705
TRAVIS: 15.

1460
01:32:25,705 --> 01:32:30,830
MATT: 15. Your attention goes to Vex, as opposed
to Trinket. You move out of the way.

1461
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:33,399
SAM: And he takes 3d8.

1462
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:35,455
MATT: That's true.

1463
01:32:35,455 --> 01:32:41,332
SAM: Eight plus nine is 17.

1464
01:32:41,332 --> 01:32:49,375
MATT: Well, the creature has to make a wisdom
save. Fails, so yeah, takes 3d8. Yep.

1465
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:50,945
SAM: 17.

1466
01:32:50,945 --> 01:32:52,164
MATT: 17.

1467
01:32:52,164 --> 01:32:53,199
TRAVIS: 17 to hit?

1468
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,982
SAM: No, I just hit you with 17 points of damage.

1469
01:32:54,982 --> 01:32:55,917
TRAVIS: Okay.

1470
01:32:55,917 --> 01:33:04,306
MATT: All right. You're feeling the ghostly form--
you take the damage as soon as the form inside;

1471
01:33:04,306 --> 01:33:11,164
you're feeling this dissipation. All right, so you
make your two attacks against Vex.

1472
01:33:11,164 --> 01:33:12,177
LAURA: Shit.

1473
01:33:12,177 --> 01:33:15,505
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not awesome. That's 17.

1474
01:33:15,505 --> 01:33:16,716
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

1475
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,571
TRAVIS: That does. 24.

1476
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:25,075
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. The first
hammer swing you're ready for. Swing backward. It

1477
01:33:25,075 --> 01:33:25,966
goes long.

1478
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:27,857
LAURA: Grog! Grog, no. No!

1479
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:32,816
TRAVIS: 20 on the first.

1480
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:36,167
MATT: 20 points of damage. (impact noise) First
one didn't hit, did it?

1481
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,017
LAURA: The first one didn't hit, so you only get
the 20.

1482
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:39,136
TRAVIS: Oh, just the 20!

1483
01:33:39,136 --> 01:33:43,046
MATT: Just 20, so as the first one misses, you
pull back, trying to stop him, but the hammer

1484
01:33:43,046 --> 01:33:46,021
still slams you in the side; you don't have time
to move out of the way, and it pushes you up

1485
01:33:46,021 --> 01:33:50,647
against the wall. You land on your feet, and you
can feel the pulsing of the blood broken beneath

1486
01:33:50,647 --> 01:33:54,551
the skin. That ends Grog's go. Percy, you're up.

1487
01:33:54,551 --> 01:34:02,146
TALIESIN: (gasps, sighs) "Hi!" I saw what just
happened, right?

1488
01:34:02,164 --> 01:34:03,465
MATT: Yeah.

1489
01:34:03,465 --> 01:34:04,894
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to fix my gun.

1490
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:06,407
MATT: Go for it.

1491
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:07,508
TALIESIN: That fixes.

1492
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:08,450
MATT: All righty.

1493
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:20,343
TALIESIN: (sighs) Are you better? Good, then
let's deal with this. I'm going to start diving

1494
01:34:20,343 --> 01:34:22,692
around the columns to get away from the wraith.

1495
01:34:22,692 --> 01:34:23,713
MATT: Around here?

1496
01:34:23,713 --> 01:34:25,131
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I don't have a shot this
round.

1497
01:34:25,131 --> 01:34:27,666
MATT: Okay, so you move around that way.

1498
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:28,523
TALIESIN: Yeah, cool.

1499
01:34:28,523 --> 01:34:31,124
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

1500
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:31,955
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

1501
01:34:31,955 --> 01:34:46,432
MATT: It's now their turn. This one currently
loses interest in you and drifts two, three, four,

1502
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:53,618
five, six, seven, eight-- it (whoosh) passes
through the stone. Moves through and appears on

1503
01:34:53,618 --> 01:34:56,580
the other side. I need you to make a charisma
saving throw.

1504
01:34:56,580 --> 01:35:00,851
TALIESIN: I have advantage on charisma saving
throws right now, do I not?

1505
01:35:00,851 --> 01:35:03,002
LAURA: Oh, yeah, because she cast--

1506
01:35:03,002 --> 01:35:05,293
MARISHA: It's not there anymore. Sorry.

1507
01:35:05,293 --> 01:35:08,317
MATT: Yeah. She dropped it when she picked up the
concentration spell.

1508
01:35:08,317 --> 01:35:11,582
TRAVIS: Roll high, golden snitch.

1509
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:13,403
MATT: And that was ability checks, not saving
throws.

1510
01:35:13,403 --> 01:35:22,765
TALIESIN: Oh, then never mind. What's my charisma
saving-- oh boy. Nope. I rolled a natural one. You

1511
01:35:22,765 --> 01:35:25,472
did this! This is the third natural one. You
touched it.

1512
01:35:25,472 --> 01:35:28,754
LAURA: That's why I'm superstitious about my
dice.

1513
01:35:28,754 --> 01:35:29,925
MARISHA: I touched it.

1514
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:31,704
LAURA: He also touched mine, and I rolled a
three.

1515
01:35:31,704 --> 01:35:34,739
TALIESIN: I'll come back to you after
Thanksgiving, baby.

1516
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:43,173
MATT: And with that, it goes dark and a spiritual
intent takes over your body. You feel like you're

1517
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:46,943
being puppeted, and you have no control over
yourself. You're hidden, captured within your own

1518
01:35:46,943 --> 01:35:51,787
form. All right, that ends his turn. Vax, you're
up.

1519
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:52,758
LIAM: Okay.

1520
01:35:52,758 --> 01:36:01,490
MATT: You still feel the residual warmth in your
glove pulsing.

1521
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:12,284
LIAM: All right. I'm going to click my boots
together. I'm going to move towards him.

1522
01:36:12,284 --> 01:36:14,585
MATT: Towards Percy?

1523
01:36:14,585 --> 01:36:21,444
LIAM: Towards Percy. Shit. I'm going to take the
keen dagger and stick it into his gut, and I'm

1524
01:36:21,444 --> 01:36:25,745
going to take the glove with the symbol of
Sarenrae and punch him in the nose.

1525
01:36:25,745 --> 01:36:26,949
MATT: Okay.

1526
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:31,365
LAURA: I like that you're violent instead of just
going, "Healing hand."

1527
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:32,364
MARISHA: Yeah!

1528
01:36:32,364 --> 01:36:33,821
LAURA: You go, "fuck you!"

1529
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:37,566
SAM: Can I just say, this is Percy beating up
Percy right now.

1530
01:36:37,566 --> 01:36:40,354
(laughter)

1531
01:36:40,354 --> 01:36:43,476
MATT: Yeah. You're being attacked and stabbed by
yourself. It's weird.

1532
01:36:43,476 --> 01:36:44,547
LIAM: 20 for the dagger.

1533
01:36:44,547 --> 01:36:46,749
TALIESIN: I'm not reading too much into this.

1534
01:36:46,749 --> 01:36:47,846
MATT: That hits.

1535
01:36:47,846 --> 01:36:52,405
LIAM: The punch is just strength modifier, right?

1536
01:36:52,405 --> 01:36:53,653
TALIESIN: This is not a metaphor!

1537
01:36:53,653 --> 01:36:55,115
LIAM: 17 for the punch.

1538
01:36:55,115 --> 01:37:02,491
MATT: All right. Roll damage for the dagger.
What's your AC?

1539
01:37:02,491 --> 01:37:03,413
TALIESIN: 18.

1540
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:04,625
MATT: 18. Okay.

1541
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,283
LIAM: Nine.

1542
01:37:06,283 --> 01:37:10,914
MATT: You take nine points of piercing damage as
the dagger stabs into your stomach. As you swing

1543
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:14,891
to haul the punch off, the body ducks out of the
way.

1544
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:16,426
MARISHA: Take the punch!

1545
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,101
MATT: All right. That ends your turn.

1546
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:19,613
LIAM: Wait. How far did I go?

1547
01:37:19,613 --> 01:37:25,787
MATT: You were there, so that's 15 feet.

1548
01:37:25,787 --> 01:37:28,655
LIAM: I want to spring back and run as far as I
can in the other direction, around the corner

1549
01:37:28,655 --> 01:37:30,185
towards the rest.

1550
01:37:30,185 --> 01:37:37,095
MATT: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.

1551
01:37:37,095 --> 01:37:48,593
SAM: I walk between Grog and Keyleth, maintaining
my 15-foot distance. Even more between.

1552
01:37:48,593 --> 01:37:50,252
MATT: There?

1553
01:37:50,252 --> 01:37:54,495
SAM: Yeah, and I'll Thunderwave them both. Oh no,
and I hit Trinket.

1554
01:37:54,495 --> 01:37:58,136
(laughter)

1555
01:37:58,136 --> 01:38:05,516
MATT: All right. Constitution saving throw from
Grog and Keyleth and Trinket.

1556
01:38:05,516 --> 01:38:09,636
TRAVIS: Do we roll something?

1557
01:38:09,636 --> 01:38:10,754
LAURA: Yeah.

1558
01:38:10,754 --> 01:38:11,723
MATT: What did you roll?

1559
01:38:11,723 --> 01:38:12,722
MARISHA: 12.

1560
01:38:12,722 --> 01:38:15,255
MATT: (thud) Grog?

1561
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:16,455
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

1562
01:38:16,455 --> 01:38:18,593
MATT: What's your DC?

1563
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:20,089
SAM: 19.

1564
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:22,619
MATT: All right, so roll damage. What's
Trinket's?

1565
01:38:22,619 --> 01:38:25,230
LAURA: You have a constitution saving throw of
eight.

1566
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,706
TRAVIS: Oh. 26.

1567
01:38:26,706 --> 01:38:27,824
MATT: Okay, so you take half damage.

1568
01:38:27,824 --> 01:38:30,563
LAURA: Trinket rolled an 11.

1569
01:38:30,563 --> 01:38:32,793
MATT: Okay. (thud)

1570
01:38:32,793 --> 01:38:37,000
SAM: Eight points of damage.

1571
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,621
MATT: Okay, so you take eight points of damage.
Grog takes four. Trinket takes eight.

1572
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:47,951
SAM: Are we trying to kill our friends, here?

1573
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:49,116
TRAVIS: Yeah, get us.

1574
01:38:49,116 --> 01:38:51,825
LAURA: Get them unconscious so they come out. But
then if they're unconscious, the ghosts come out

1575
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,847
and they could possess us.

1576
01:38:53,847 --> 01:38:55,342
SAM: That's great.

1577
01:38:55,342 --> 01:38:57,413
MARISHA: But they take radiant damage.

1578
01:38:57,413 --> 01:39:00,677
MATT: Keyleth, top of the turn, roll--

1579
01:39:00,677 --> 01:39:03,358
MARISHA: Did I get radiant damage from that push?

1580
01:39:03,358 --> 01:39:04,246
SAM: No.

1581
01:39:04,246 --> 01:39:06,294
MATT: You take 3d8 points of radiant damage.

1582
01:39:06,294 --> 01:39:07,315
MARISHA: Oh, I do.

1583
01:39:07,315 --> 01:39:15,318
SAM: From the spirit guardians. Oh, and I'll also
inspire Vax. (sings) Rip out someone's tongue

1584
01:39:15,318 --> 01:39:21,741
and I'll know you. Cure someone dead and I'll show
you've got those moves with dagger. You've got

1585
01:39:21,741 --> 01:39:23,812
those moves with dagger. You've got those--

1586
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:26,989
ALL: (sings) Moves like dagger.

1587
01:39:26,989 --> 01:39:31,725
SAM: Okay. 13.

1588
01:39:31,725 --> 01:39:41,679
MATT: All right, so 13 points of radiant damage to
you and to... okay.

1589
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,741
MARISHA: 62 hit points.

1590
01:39:45,741 --> 01:39:49,606
MATT: All right. Scanlan, that's your turn.
Keyleth.

1591
01:39:49,606 --> 01:39:50,748
MARISHA: Yeah?

1592
01:39:50,748 --> 01:39:57,148
MATT: You turn around as you see Vax rush up with
a look of fear and intensity on his face. You see

1593
01:39:57,148 --> 01:40:02,290
her turn around with this twisted grin on her
face, and she brings her staff up and swings it

1594
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:04,075
towards your head. Roll an attack.

1595
01:40:04,075 --> 01:40:09,238
MARISHA: (whoosh) Baseball. 17.

1596
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:10,608
MATT: What's your AC?

1597
01:40:10,608 --> 01:40:12,515
LIAM: It is 18.

1598
01:40:12,515 --> 01:40:16,641
MATT: 18. As she swings, you duck, and her staff
(impact noise) smacks against the stone wall of

1599
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:23,629
the mausoleum. That ends your turn, bringing us to
Vex.

1600
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:27,371
LAURA: And I'm in a fight with Grog.

1601
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:28,350
MATT: Correct.

1602
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:34,376
LAURA: Okay. This is totally awesome.

1603
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:37,882
SAM: Wait! We have Cass. Does she get a turn?

1604
01:40:37,882 --> 01:40:39,715
LAURA: She's not doing anything.

1605
01:40:39,715 --> 01:40:42,272
MATT: I forgot to add her to the initiative.
That's my own fault.

1606
01:40:42,272 --> 01:40:43,871
LAURA: I just thought she was being a bitch.

1607
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:47,337
MATT: I'll give her a couple of rounds here in a
second. Anyway, finish up.

1608
01:40:47,337 --> 01:40:53,180
LAURA: Trinket runs forward and tries to pull
Grog's focus so that I can back away.

1609
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:59,752
MATT: Okay, so Trinket moves up to there.

1610
01:40:59,752 --> 01:41:03,509
LAURA: He tries to grapple him, or something. Can
he do anything to make Grog not be able to attack

1611
01:41:03,509 --> 01:41:09,949
me if I run away? Can he try to knock him down, or
something? Jump up on his back and knock him

1612
01:41:09,949 --> 01:41:11,176
over.

1613
01:41:11,176 --> 01:41:16,149
MATT: Use an action to make a trip attack. Sure,
why not. Roll an athletics check.

1614
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:19,495
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, no problem.

1615
01:41:19,495 --> 01:41:21,636
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a bear doing mild
calisthenics.

1616
01:41:21,636 --> 01:41:25,077
LAURA: An athletics check for me?

1617
01:41:25,077 --> 01:41:26,244
MATT: No, for Trinket.

1618
01:41:26,244 --> 01:41:28,961
LAURA: Okay. 12?

1619
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:31,108
MATT: Make a strength saving throw, Grog.

1620
01:41:31,108 --> 01:41:36,020
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

1621
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:41,594
MATT: Yeah, Trinket rushes over and tries to knock
you off your feet, and you just (thud) no effect.

1622
01:41:41,594 --> 01:41:44,411
You still have a bonus action and your movement,
if you want to.

1623
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:50,329
LAURA: I'm going to try to roll out of the way.
I'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the

1624
01:41:50,329 --> 01:41:53,350
way to make him less likely to hit me.

1625
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:57,887
SAM: Yeah! The old "less likely" trick.

1626
01:41:57,887 --> 01:42:00,146
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

1627
01:42:00,146 --> 01:42:03,809
LAURA: Okay. Oh, my dice suck tonight!

1628
01:42:03,809 --> 01:42:05,041
SAM: You're inspired.

1629
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,606
MARISHA: He's sucking up all the good energy.

1630
01:42:07,606 --> 01:42:13,251
LAURA: That's good! Acrobatics. 28.

1631
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:19,594
MATT: 28? Grog, roll an attack with disadvantage,
just for the hell of it.

1632
01:42:19,594 --> 01:42:24,938
TRAVIS: 23.

1633
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,007
MATT: Okay, roll damage against Vex as she pulls
away from you.

1634
01:42:28,007 --> 01:42:31,951
TRAVIS: The first one was a natural 20.

1635
01:42:31,951 --> 01:42:34,417
MATT: Be glad it was disadvantage.

1636
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:37,950
TRAVIS: 21.

1637
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:43,568
MATT: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. As
you pull away, Grog (whack) backhands you with his

1638
01:42:43,568 --> 01:42:47,013
hammer. Now you can take your bonus action, if you
want to.

1639
01:42:47,013 --> 01:42:53,179
LAURA: As my bonus action, I'm going to cast--

1640
01:42:53,179 --> 01:42:57,281
TRAVIS: Kill Goliath.

1641
01:42:57,281 --> 01:43:02,163
LAURA: Right? I don't want to use any of my shit!

1642
01:43:02,163 --> 01:43:04,026
TRAVIS: Can you conjure a keg of beer?

1643
01:43:04,026 --> 01:43:06,408
SAM: That would distract you.

1644
01:43:06,408 --> 01:43:13,879
LAURA: I can't, but that's a really good idea. For
my bonus action, I'm going to go, help!

1645
01:43:13,879 --> 01:43:17,493
SAM: You can use your bonus action to throw me the
gun!

1646
01:43:17,493 --> 01:43:20,467
LAURA: Oh. No.

1647
01:43:20,467 --> 01:43:28,208
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Cassandra is
going to rush up angrily with her shortsword out.

1648
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:40,973
Rushing up behind Grog, she's going to make a
strike. That is going to be 18.

1649
01:43:40,973 --> 01:43:42,270
What's your armor class?

1650
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:43,061
TRAVIS: 19.

1651
01:43:43,061 --> 01:43:46,981
MATT: 19. She goes to strike and whiffs,
unfortunately. She's going to attack with her

1652
01:43:46,981 --> 01:43:54,679
dagger she pulls out in her off hand. Rolls a
three. Yeah. I'm giving her a second round because

1653
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:58,577
I missed the one. She's going to angrily pull up
again and attempt to strike with both a second

1654
01:43:58,577 --> 01:44:01,102
time. That will be a 20.

1655
01:44:01,102 --> 01:44:02,103
TRAVIS: That hits.

1656
01:44:02,103 --> 01:44:06,631
MATT: All righty. Because Trinket is adjacent, she
gets sneak attack damage.

1657
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:09,082
LAURA: Yay! Oh, she's a rogue.

1658
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:10,283
LIAM: Rogue.

1659
01:44:10,283 --> 01:44:24,873
MATT: So you take 27 points of piercing damage.
Well, it's slashing damage from the shortsword.

1660
01:44:24,873 --> 01:44:29,240
The offhand attack is another three. Going to
miss.

1661
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,404
TRAVIS: Okay.

1662
01:44:30,404 --> 01:44:40,906
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Grog. Roll
another d20.

1663
01:44:40,906 --> 01:44:46,442
TRAVIS: 11.

1664
01:44:46,442 --> 01:44:52,352
MATT: 11. Your attention switches to Cassandra.
Roll two attacks.

1665
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:55,752
SAM: Do I get my radiant damage on him?

1666
01:44:55,752 --> 01:45:00,023
MATT: At the top of his turn, you do, yeah.
Actually, before that happens, roll radiant

1667
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:00,989
damage.

1668
01:45:00,989 --> 01:45:02,327
SAM: 21.

1669
01:45:02,327 --> 01:45:04,710
TRAVIS: 21 points?

1670
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:11,570
MATT: With that, as you're reeling up your hammer
to strike Cassandra, a burst of radiant energy

1671
01:45:11,608 --> 01:45:16,865
disintegrates the ghostly presence within your
body, and you find your mind come to you as you're

1672
01:45:16,865 --> 01:45:22,405
about to go into a downswing to smash Cassandra's
head in. You catch yourself.

1673
01:45:22,405 --> 01:45:23,711
SAM: Do it anyway, Grog!

1674
01:45:23,711 --> 01:45:25,408
(laughter)

1675
01:45:25,408 --> 01:45:26,585
MARISHA: Don't!

1676
01:45:26,585 --> 01:45:28,151
SAM: She's one of us.

1677
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:29,705
MATT: You have your turn now.

1678
01:45:29,705 --> 01:45:30,997
TRAVIS: Oh, I have my turn?

1679
01:45:30,997 --> 01:45:31,819
MATT: Yes.

1680
01:45:31,819 --> 01:45:36,950
SAM: Grog, I know you don't know what's going on
right now, but kill Keyleth!

1681
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:41,805
TRAVIS: Okay. I turn and walk over to Keyleth.

1682
01:45:41,805 --> 01:45:43,528
MATT: Over Cassandra.

1683
01:45:43,528 --> 01:45:44,775
TALIESIN: Poor Cass.

1684
01:45:44,775 --> 01:45:48,911
TRAVIS: I'm going to swing my hammer at the middle
of her chest.

1685
01:45:48,911 --> 01:45:53,995
SAM: Oh, you're scary. She's so cute.

1686
01:45:53,995 --> 01:45:56,025
TRAVIS: 15.

1687
01:45:56,025 --> 01:45:57,957
MATT: What's your AC, Keyleth?

1688
01:45:57,957 --> 01:45:58,982
MARISHA: 18.

1689
01:45:58,982 --> 01:46:02,167
MATT: She ducks out of the way with this
preternatural speed.

1690
01:46:02,167 --> 01:46:05,584
TRAVIS: Wow. 16.

1691
01:46:05,584 --> 01:46:08,434
MARISHA: (cackles)

1692
01:46:08,434 --> 01:46:13,730
MATT: Keyleth's ghostly form is too fast for you.
The confusion of the whole sequence caused you to

1693
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:18,597
not be able to think straight in the moment, and
you miss twice. That ends your turn, Grog. Percy.

1694
01:46:18,597 --> 01:46:21,956
LAURA: Oh, right. Percy's still--

1695
01:46:21,956 --> 01:46:23,817
SAM: Jesus. And he's got guns.

1696
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:25,170
MATT: Your gun was just fixed, correct?

1697
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,462
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1698
01:46:26,462 --> 01:46:28,452
(laughter)

1699
01:46:28,452 --> 01:46:32,282
TALIESIN: Would he use the gun or the sword in
phantom mode?

1700
01:46:32,282 --> 01:46:38,242
MATT: You just finished fixing this, and you have
a gun before you. It's going to use it. Make three

1701
01:46:38,242 --> 01:46:40,995
attacks against Vex-- Vax. I mean Vax.

1702
01:46:40,995 --> 01:46:43,503
TALIESIN: I'm going to use this die, because it's
been--

1703
01:46:43,503 --> 01:46:46,383
MARISHA: Failing? Yeah, I touched it. Use the one
that I touched.

1704
01:46:46,383 --> 01:46:54,731
TALIESIN: That's-- I can't talk. 21.

1705
01:46:54,731 --> 01:46:59,544
LIAM: That hits, but what's applicable? Uncanny
Dodge or Evasion for a gunshot?

1706
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:06,612
MATT: Whatever reduces the damage to half. It's
not a saving throw, so it would be-- which one

1707
01:47:06,612 --> 01:47:08,026
reduces the damage by half?

1708
01:47:08,061 --> 01:47:09,338
LIAM: That's Uncanny Dodge.

1709
01:47:09,338 --> 01:47:12,856
MATT: Then it would be Uncanny Dodge. All right,
so attack two more times.

1710
01:47:12,856 --> 01:47:15,309
TALIESIN: 21.

1711
01:47:15,309 --> 01:47:17,194
MATT: Hits. And?

1712
01:47:17,194 --> 01:47:20,684
TALIESIN: 26.

1713
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:23,348
MATT: All right, so roll damage three times. The
first one is halved.

1714
01:47:23,348 --> 01:47:29,993
TALIESIN: All right. 13.

1715
01:47:29,993 --> 01:47:32,125
MATT: So you take seven damage.

1716
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:35,321
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 15.

1717
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:37,109
MATT: 15 piercing damage.

1718
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:38,471
TALIESIN: And 11.

1719
01:47:38,471 --> 01:47:42,918
MATT: Okay. (three gunshots)

1720
01:47:42,918 --> 01:47:46,497
SAM: We are so strong! We should never fight
ourselves.

1721
01:47:46,497 --> 01:47:58,402
MATT: All right. That ends Percy's turn there.
Vax, you're up.

1722
01:47:58,402 --> 01:48:04,191
LIAM: Am I able to slide around Keyleth closer to
you, into that little alcove, or am I too pressed

1723
01:48:04,191 --> 01:48:06,790
against the wall? The other way.

1724
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:10,655
MATT: Currently, it's just enemies, so you can't
move past them.

1725
01:48:10,655 --> 01:48:11,879
LIAM: Okay.

1726
01:48:11,879 --> 01:48:13,939
MATT: I could make you roll an acrobatics check,
if you wanted.

1727
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:16,791
LIAM: That's all right. I flip the daggers over,
and I start to whale on

1728
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,076
the back of Keyleth's head.

1729
01:48:18,076 --> 01:48:18,843
MATT: Okay.

1730
01:48:18,843 --> 01:48:20,095
LIAM: Pommels of the daggers.

1731
01:48:20,095 --> 01:48:21,921
SAM: Kiss or kill.

1732
01:48:21,921 --> 01:48:25,883
LIAM: 18.

1733
01:48:25,883 --> 01:48:29,650
MATT: Are you doing sneak attack on this? She's
adjacent to Grog, so yeah.

1734
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:30,794
LIAM: Definitely.

1735
01:48:30,794 --> 01:48:31,873
MATT: 18 hits.

1736
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:36,760
LIAM: Second one is 20.

1737
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,156
MARISHA: Hits.

1738
01:48:39,156 --> 01:48:41,276
MATT: They both hit, so roll damage on both.

1739
01:48:41,276 --> 01:48:42,752
LIAM: And then 32 on the last.

1740
01:48:42,752 --> 01:48:45,547
MATT: Oh, that's right. So three hits, with sneak
attack.

1741
01:48:45,547 --> 01:48:47,877
MARISHA: Oh, sneak attack is going to take me
down.

1742
01:48:47,877 --> 01:48:57,514
LIAM: Three. Plus seven is ten. And the ten gets
doubled? Or everything?

1743
01:48:57,514 --> 01:48:59,147
MARISHA: Dice rolls get doubled.

1744
01:48:59,147 --> 01:49:03,985
LIAM: Ten, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 50.

1745
01:49:03,985 --> 01:49:05,324
SAM: 50?

1746
01:49:05,324 --> 01:49:06,698
LIAM: 50 for the first hit.

1747
01:49:06,698 --> 01:49:08,584
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm still alive.

1748
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:10,054
MATT: Was it doubled because you rolled a
critical?

1749
01:49:10,054 --> 01:49:11,365
MARISHA: Sneak Attack.

1750
01:49:11,365 --> 01:49:12,950
MATT: Sneak Attack, you just roll the dice.

1751
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:14,019
LIAM: Well, then no. 25.

1752
01:49:14,019 --> 01:49:14,828
MATT: 25.

1753
01:49:14,828 --> 01:49:16,005
LIAM: Thank you.

1754
01:49:16,005 --> 01:49:16,890
MATT: No worries.

1755
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:19,016
LIAM: Plus nine, plus nine.

1756
01:49:19,016 --> 01:49:21,184
MATT: Okay, so 25 plus 18...

1757
01:49:21,184 --> 01:49:22,348
LIAM: 38.

1758
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:23,592
MARISHA: 38? Okay.

1759
01:49:23,592 --> 01:49:27,656
MATT: 25 plus 18 is 43.

1760
01:49:27,656 --> 01:49:30,357
MARISHA: 43?

1761
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:31,539
MATT: Yep.

1762
01:49:31,539 --> 01:49:32,713
MARISHA: What was I at just now?

1763
01:49:32,713 --> 01:49:34,441
SAM: 62. So you're at 19.

1764
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:35,597
MARISHA: 19 hit points.

1765
01:49:35,597 --> 01:49:41,847
LIAM: I'm going to use-- I don't care. I'm going
to slide around Grog, to the side. Towards

1766
01:49:41,847 --> 01:49:44,423
Scanlan. Right there, yeah.

1767
01:49:44,423 --> 01:49:45,559
MATT: Okay.

1768
01:49:45,559 --> 01:49:47,608
SAM: What's up, brother?

1769
01:49:47,608 --> 01:49:53,473
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

1770
01:49:53,473 --> 01:49:54,947
SAM: I'm up again?

1771
01:49:54,947 --> 01:49:56,100
MATT: Yep.

1772
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:02,978
SAM: I feel like I just went. All right. We're
trying to kill our friends, right?

1773
01:50:02,978 --> 01:50:03,945
LIAM: Yes.

1774
01:50:03,945 --> 01:50:09,086
SAM: Okay. Thank you for moving, Vax. I'm going to
blast them both with lightning. Straight shot

1775
01:50:09,086 --> 01:50:10,456
through, 100 feet.

1776
01:50:10,456 --> 01:50:15,161
MATT: Through those two? Yeah. Okay.

1777
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:19,204
SAM: Yeah. What do I do? 8d6?

1778
01:50:19,204 --> 01:50:23,177
MATT: 8d6, and I need Keyleth and Percy to both
make dexterity saving throws.

1779
01:50:23,177 --> 01:50:29,206
MARISHA: Just the two of us? I actually have
disadvantage on dexterity stuff because of

1780
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:35,503
corruption. 20 for me.

1781
01:50:35,503 --> 01:50:36,700
TALIESIN: 21.

1782
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,152
MATT: You both take half damage.

1783
01:50:38,152 --> 01:50:39,206
SAM: 24.

1784
01:50:39,206 --> 01:50:45,469
MATT: You both take 12 points of lightning damage.
The bolt strikes through, hitting both of you in

1785
01:50:45,469 --> 01:50:48,240
the chest, but you both manage to pull out of the
way just in time to reduce the

1786
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:49,473
impact of the spell.

1787
01:50:49,473 --> 01:50:58,830
SAM: And as a bonus action, I'll do a Healing Word
on Vex. Right? You're injured badly?

1788
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:02,219
LAURA: I mean, not badly, but--

1789
01:51:02,219 --> 01:51:07,686
SAM: Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured
badly? Would I know that?

1790
01:51:07,726 --> 01:51:11,686
MATT: You could glance over and look at him as he
pulls up to you, and see him (pants).

1791
01:51:11,736 --> 01:51:13,259
LIAM: I've got gunshots in my back.

1792
01:51:13,259 --> 01:51:17,324
SAM: Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word.

1793
01:51:17,324 --> 01:51:19,114
MATT: Roll the healing points for that.

1794
01:51:19,114 --> 01:51:27,109
SAM: What is it? Shit. It's right here: d4 plus
five. That's it?! So lame. Seven points.

1795
01:51:27,109 --> 01:51:31,226
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, at
the top of your turn, roll 3d8 radiant damage.

1796
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:34,343
SAM: Ooh, yes. Oh, this is going to knock you
out.

1797
01:51:34,343 --> 01:51:35,556
MARISHA: Hopefully.

1798
01:51:35,556 --> 01:51:41,036
SAM: That's nine already.

1799
01:51:41,036 --> 01:51:42,075
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm down.

1800
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:44,936
SAM: Six more is 15.

1801
01:51:44,936 --> 01:51:52,243
MATT: Keyleth falls unconscious to the ground as
this blast of radiant energy bursts around her as

1802
01:51:52,243 --> 01:51:56,799
this spiritual radiant form that's been
surrounding the area and stalking the various

1803
01:51:56,799 --> 01:52:03,421
individuals. It slams into her form. As she
collapses, the ghost is jettisoned from her body

1804
01:52:03,421 --> 01:52:08,262
and looks like it's been taking the radiant damage
and is having a hard time keeping its corporeal

1805
01:52:08,262 --> 01:52:15,145
form. All right, that ends Keyleth's turn.
Keyleth, I need you to roll a death saving throw.

1806
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:17,786
MARISHA: Nope. Six.

1807
01:52:17,786 --> 01:52:22,786
MATT: You take one death saving throw failure. All
right. Vex, you're up.

1808
01:52:22,786 --> 01:52:31,576
LAURA: I see the ghost come out of her? Okay, I'm
going to shoot it with my Blazing Bowstring.

1809
01:52:31,576 --> 01:52:33,071
MATT: Okay.

1810
01:52:33,071 --> 01:52:40,050
LAURA: 16?

1811
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:41,558
MATT: 16 hits.

1812
01:52:41,558 --> 01:52:57,647
LAURA: 17. I want a good one. 17. 25.

1813
01:52:57,647 --> 01:53:02,122
MATT: 25. As you pull back the arrow and you see
the flames ignite around the shaft, you release

1814
01:53:02,122 --> 01:53:08,586
it. It slams into the ghost, and you see its form
(raspy cry) disperse from the impact, the arrow

1815
01:53:08,586 --> 01:53:12,676
hitting the wall behind it and shattering against
the stone. Ghost destroyed.

1816
01:53:12,676 --> 01:53:17,816
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to attack
Percy. Can I see him?

1817
01:53:17,816 --> 01:53:19,181
MATT: Yep, right over there.

1818
01:53:19,181 --> 01:53:22,930
LAURA: All right, I'm going to do it. 21.

1819
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:24,187
MATT: 21 hits.

1820
01:53:24,187 --> 01:53:27,981
TALIESIN: (ghost noises)

1821
01:53:27,981 --> 01:53:28,974
LAURA: 16.

1822
01:53:28,974 --> 01:53:30,803
MATT: 16 points of damage to you, Percy.

1823
01:53:30,803 --> 01:53:32,071
TALIESIN: 16?

1824
01:53:32,071 --> 01:53:32,981
MATT: Yep.

1825
01:53:32,981 --> 01:53:33,712
TALIESIN: Cool.

1826
01:53:33,712 --> 01:53:35,413
LAURA: That was also through my Blazing
Bowstring.

1827
01:53:35,413 --> 01:53:37,881
MATT: So you're using both Blazing Bowstring
abilities right now?

1828
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:38,715
LAURA: Yeah.

1829
01:53:38,715 --> 01:53:42,860
MATT: Okay. A flaming arrow (impact noise) sticks
into the shoulder, and you can feel the flames

1830
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:44,122
burning into your body--

1831
01:53:44,122 --> 01:53:46,468
LAURA: Plus another five. That was another five
burning damage.

1832
01:53:46,468 --> 01:53:47,251
TRAVIS: 21.

1833
01:53:47,251 --> 01:53:48,174
TALIESIN: 21?

1834
01:53:48,174 --> 01:53:49,592
MATT: There you go.

1835
01:53:49,592 --> 01:53:51,578
TALIESIN: I'm still doing fine.

1836
01:53:51,578 --> 01:53:52,984
MARISHA: I hate these things.

1837
01:53:52,984 --> 01:53:57,523
MATT: It's now Cass's turn. Cass, who's having a
weird time with the whole process of seeing a

1838
01:53:57,523 --> 01:54:00,631
bunch of herselves and her brothers stabbing each
other and getting possessed.

1839
01:54:00,631 --> 01:54:01,922
LAURA: How do we even know who's who?

1840
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:03,313
MARISHA: Stop hitting yourself!

1841
01:54:03,313 --> 01:54:09,865
TALIESIN: Thank you for that. I was almost going
there.

1842
01:54:09,865 --> 01:54:13,145
MATT: She's right there, and she brings herself
around the way. She's not able to do any actions,

1843
01:54:13,145 --> 01:54:20,247
so she sees another of her brothers possessed but
clutching the gun in the hand, and is steeling her

1844
01:54:20,247 --> 01:54:23,868
blade for the moment and doesn't do anything with
her turn. Grog, you're up.

1845
01:54:23,936 --> 01:54:27,187
TRAVIS: "Percy!" And I run towards him.

1846
01:54:27,187 --> 01:54:34,736
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul!

1847
01:54:34,736 --> 01:54:36,456
TRAVIS: 25.

1848
01:54:36,456 --> 01:54:39,100
TALIESIN: Is no one a Sam Raimi fan? Never mind.

1849
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,601
SAM: That was Donald Duck, right?

1850
01:54:40,601 --> 01:54:41,619
TRAVIS: 18?

1851
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:43,042
MATT: What's your armor class?

1852
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:43,902
TALIESIN: 18.

1853
01:54:43,902 --> 01:54:45,436
MATT: Yeah, hits. Damage on both.

1854
01:54:45,436 --> 01:54:55,714
TRAVIS: 17 for the first one. 19 for the second
one.

1855
01:54:55,714 --> 01:55:05,556
MATT: Okay, so 36 points of damage. (two impacts)
You're thrown up against the wall and almost

1856
01:55:05,556 --> 01:55:08,708
pushed over off your feet from the sheer weight of
the impact.

1857
01:55:08,708 --> 01:55:10,411
TALIESIN: It has to be magic damage, though.

1858
01:55:10,411 --> 01:55:11,779
LAURA: It was. It's a magic war hammer.

1859
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:15,516
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's
good. Maybe.

1860
01:55:15,516 --> 01:55:16,999
MARISHA: They have to be spells.

1861
01:55:16,999 --> 01:55:18,453
TRAVIS: There was fire damage.

1862
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:26,652
MATT: Yeah. It seems that the radiant damage from
the Spirit Guardian spell you're doing has been

1863
01:55:26,652 --> 01:55:31,250
doing the bulk of damage to them while they're
inside the form. Most everything else is going

1864
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,674
straight to the individual.

1865
01:55:32,674 --> 01:55:34,109
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh shit!

1866
01:55:34,109 --> 01:55:36,753
SAM: We've just been killing our friends for no
reason?

1867
01:55:36,753 --> 01:55:38,078
LAURA: Good times.

1868
01:55:38,078 --> 01:55:40,970
TRAVIS: Let's pass our--

1869
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:42,762
SAM: Hold our wrath.

1870
01:55:42,762 --> 01:55:48,068
MATT: Percy. You have three more shots with this
gun, two of which are magical.

1871
01:55:48,068 --> 01:55:49,366
TALIESIN: I do.

1872
01:55:49,366 --> 01:55:53,855
MATT: So you pull up the gun, you take a step
back.

1873
01:55:53,855 --> 01:55:57,785
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?

1874
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:01,319
MATT: You do. Attack of opportunity against Percy,
if you want to take it.

1875
01:56:01,319 --> 01:56:02,555
MARISHA: Come on, take him down.

1876
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:04,007
LAURA: Oh no!

1877
01:56:04,007 --> 01:56:05,324
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

1878
01:56:05,324 --> 01:56:06,218
TALIESIN: Yes!

1879
01:56:06,218 --> 01:56:07,265
MATT: Roll damage.

1880
01:56:07,265 --> 01:56:11,216
TRAVIS: That's actually the first time I've
critted on this show.

1881
01:56:11,216 --> 01:56:13,377
MATT: You get additional dice.

1882
01:56:13,377 --> 01:56:14,753
TRAVIS: It does additional damage.

1883
01:56:14,753 --> 01:56:16,868
MATT: It's the first time you've critically hit on
this show?

1884
01:56:16,868 --> 01:56:18,185
TRAVIS: I think so, because I've never doubled my
dice.

1885
01:56:18,185 --> 01:56:19,812
MATT: That's absurd.

1886
01:56:19,812 --> 01:56:22,770
TRAVIS: I know. 14.

1887
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:24,571
TALIESIN: 14? I'm already out.

1888
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:26,765
MATT: Roll damage. I want to know what it is.

1889
01:56:26,765 --> 01:56:28,858
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead, but I'm out.

1890
01:56:28,858 --> 01:56:35,948
TRAVIS: 18, so-- what was the first one? 18 and?

1891
01:56:35,948 --> 01:56:37,085
MARISHA: You said 14.

1892
01:56:37,085 --> 01:56:43,154
MATT: Okay. You are out. Percy falls to the
ground, unconscious. The spirit is jettisoned out

1893
01:56:43,154 --> 01:56:52,670
the side. That ends your turn entirely. The ghost
is going to shift over. It does not get its

1894
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:54,186
possession back.

1895
01:56:54,186 --> 01:56:58,284
TALIESIN: It was just a crit. It wasn't hit
twice.

1896
01:56:58,284 --> 01:57:00,079
MARISHA: It wasn't when he was down.

1897
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:03,866
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a death saving
throw, by the way.

1898
01:57:03,866 --> 01:57:06,105
TALIESIN: Yay!

1899
01:57:06,105 --> 01:57:13,393
MATT: Okay. The ghost gets pushed out of the body.
With you on the ground and its possession not

1900
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:16,151
returned, it reaches down and strikes at you with
its withering touch.

1901
01:57:16,151 --> 01:57:17,359
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of--

1902
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:18,491
MARISHA: With its withering touch?

1903
01:57:18,491 --> 01:57:21,797
MATT: You take two death saving throw losses.

1904
01:57:21,797 --> 01:57:23,088
TALIESIN: Whoa!

1905
01:57:23,088 --> 01:57:24,199
LAURA: He rolled a crit?

1906
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:25,770
MATT: It's an auto-crit because he's unconscious.

1907
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:27,665
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!

1908
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,444
MARISHA: But you passed your first one.

1909
01:57:29,444 --> 01:57:30,676
TALIESIN: I passed my first one.

1910
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:31,846
MARISHA: So you have two failures on you?

1911
01:57:31,846 --> 01:57:38,090
TALIESIN: I have two failures and one success. So
guys? Heal me. Heal me now.

1912
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:39,702
MATT: Vax, you're up.

1913
01:57:39,702 --> 01:57:48,042
LIAM: I start sprinting around that open hallway
near Cassandra. I stop by Cassandra and dagger,

1914
01:57:48,042 --> 01:57:49,661
dagger, dagger.

1915
01:57:49,661 --> 01:57:51,154
MATT: Do it.

1916
01:57:51,154 --> 01:57:57,445
LIAM: First one is 30. Second one is 15. Third is
28.

1917
01:57:57,445 --> 01:57:58,895
MATT: All three hit.

1918
01:57:58,895 --> 01:58:10,867
LIAM: They all hit? Good. Ten plus seven is 17. 27
total.

1919
01:58:10,867 --> 01:58:13,342
MATT: 27 damage, total?

1920
01:58:13,342 --> 01:58:14,447
LIAM: All magic.

1921
01:58:14,447 --> 01:58:19,083
MATT: All righty, so all daggers strike through
its form. You see it tearing through its ethereal

1922
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:22,905
physicality, but it's still holding its form
together. It looks damaged, but it's still holding

1923
01:58:22,905 --> 01:58:26,223
its form on this plane. Scanlan, you're up.

1924
01:58:26,223 --> 01:58:29,767
SAM: I vault over Keyleth--

1925
01:58:29,767 --> 01:58:34,820
LIAM: Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet?

1926
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:39,421
MATT: You were here, so 35.

1927
01:58:39,421 --> 01:58:42,400
LIAM: 35? Can I run the "west" of the way--

1928
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,122
LAURA: The "west" of the way?

1929
01:58:44,122 --> 01:58:48,838
LIAM: The "west" of the way through it in front of
Percy. Yeah.

1930
01:58:48,838 --> 01:58:50,320
MATT: There? You can, yeah.

1931
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,587
LIAM: That's what I want to do.

1932
01:58:51,587 --> 01:58:54,955
MATT: All right. Scanlan?

1933
01:58:54,955 --> 01:59:04,179
SAM: I vault over Keyleth's body, using the right
part of a buttcheek to launch off. Grab a little

1934
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:05,691
feel as I go.

1935
01:59:05,691 --> 01:59:07,182
MATT: Creepy gnome.

1936
01:59:07,182 --> 01:59:10,569
SAM: I try to get within 15 feet of the thing.

1937
01:59:10,569 --> 01:59:11,914
MATT: Okay.

1938
01:59:11,914 --> 01:59:25,753
SAM: And as my first thing, I will Healing Word
Mr. Taliesin Jaffe. Percival de Rolo de Monico de

1939
01:59:25,753 --> 01:59:27,350
Chico...

1940
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:29,317
TALIESIN: (sings) It's delightful, it's
de-lovely.

1941
01:59:29,317 --> 01:59:37,954
SAM: Just at normal level, so that's nine points.

1942
01:59:37,954 --> 01:59:39,719
TALIESIN: Thank you!

1943
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:41,255
MATT: Your death saving throws are fine.

1944
01:59:41,255 --> 01:59:44,239
TALIESIN: Nine. Nine points! Ah-ah-ah.

1945
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:48,951
SAM: Jesus. I don't want to burn another fucking
thing on this guy.

1946
01:59:48,951 --> 01:59:55,816
TALIESIN: Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do
it.

1947
01:59:55,816 --> 02:00:02,623
SAM: I know, but that's when he moves, not when I
move, so I will mock him! I will say, you're not

1948
02:00:02,623 --> 02:00:13,219
even corporeal. You have no substance. You're a
nothing. You're a nobody! You won't amount to

1949
02:00:13,219 --> 02:00:14,779
nothing in this world!

1950
02:00:14,779 --> 02:00:17,957
(laughter)

1951
02:00:17,957 --> 02:00:20,948
MATT: Okay.

1952
02:00:20,948 --> 02:00:23,111
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're a nothing. You're a
nobody!

1953
02:00:23,111 --> 02:00:24,800
MATT: What's the DC on that?

1954
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,229
SAM: 19.

1955
02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:29,470
MATT: It fails its save. Roll 3d4.

1956
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:31,922
MARISHA: Kill it, Scanlan. Kill it.

1957
02:00:31,922 --> 02:00:35,083
SAM: Six.

1958
02:00:35,133 --> 02:00:36,722
MATT: (laughing) How do you want to do this?

1959
02:00:36,722 --> 02:00:38,577
(cheers and laughter)

1960
02:00:38,577 --> 02:00:40,112
TRAVIS: A mocking kill!

1961
02:00:40,112 --> 02:00:44,929
SAM: (giggles) I would like it to cry. That's
all.

1962
02:00:44,929 --> 02:00:50,031
MATT: (laughs) As you're shouting this, you can
see its ghostly form. Its face suddenly shifts

1963
02:00:50,031 --> 02:00:53,747
into the face of a person.

1964
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:56,176
SAM: You were nothing in life, and now you're
nothing in death!

1965
02:00:56,176 --> 02:01:02,624
MATT: It recalls its memories. You can see its
physical form become that of a young adult wearing

1966
02:01:02,624 --> 02:01:08,200
robes that hold the symbol of the de Rolo crest.
You see it look at its hands, and you see it look

1967
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:13,952
at you and look at Percy on the ground,
unconscious, and it moans out in horror as it

1968
02:01:13,952 --> 02:01:15,120
suddenly dissipates.

1969
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:16,808
SAM: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

1970
02:01:16,808 --> 02:01:21,909
TALIESIN: Which one of my ancestors did you just
shame to death? Again?

1971
02:01:21,909 --> 02:01:23,520
SAM: The one who possessed you!

1972
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,597
TALIESIN: Okay, fair.

1973
02:01:24,597 --> 02:01:28,650
MARISHA: Again! (laughs)

1974
02:01:28,650 --> 02:01:33,032
TALIESIN: You're going to say it, aren't you?

1975
02:01:33,032 --> 02:01:37,168
LIAM: I double back to Keyleth and start trying to
administer some sort of aid.

1976
02:01:37,168 --> 02:01:38,443
MARISHA: Hi, I'm dead.

1977
02:01:38,443 --> 02:01:39,842
LIAM: Medicine check? Is that it?

1978
02:01:39,842 --> 02:01:42,663
MATT: You can make a medicine check to try to
stabilize her, yeah.

1979
02:01:42,663 --> 02:01:43,825
LIAM: 18.

1980
02:01:43,825 --> 02:01:46,981
MATT: 18, yeah. You stabilize the bleeding. She's
no longer making death saving throws. She is still

1981
02:01:46,981 --> 02:01:52,814
unconscious. You all reconvene. Take a breath.

1982
02:01:52,814 --> 02:01:54,001
SAM: Wait, is Keyleth alive?

1983
02:01:54,001 --> 02:01:54,825
MARISHA: Nope.

1984
02:01:54,825 --> 02:01:55,903
SAM: Oh Jesus! Keyleth, I'm sorry.

1985
02:01:55,903 --> 02:01:57,711
MARISHA: I'm stabilized.

1986
02:01:57,711 --> 02:01:59,841
LIAM: She needs help. Scanlan, come here.

1987
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:01,678
TALIESIN: Let's pull ourselves together.

1988
02:02:01,678 --> 02:02:08,169
SAM: I will sing a song of rest, which will give
us 1d8 for everybody.

1989
02:02:08,169 --> 02:02:11,180
MATT: For hit dice spent, or just for the rest?

1990
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:15,171
SAM: I don't know. It just says 1d8. It's my song
of rest.

1991
02:02:15,171 --> 02:02:16,440
MATT: Song of rest.

1992
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,226
TRAVIS: I've got a lot of health potions.

1993
02:02:18,226 --> 02:02:20,978
MARISHA: You do?

1994
02:02:20,978 --> 02:02:21,911
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1995
02:02:21,911 --> 02:02:22,888
MARISHA: That's good.

1996
02:02:22,888 --> 02:02:24,382
TALIESIN: I've got three.

1997
02:02:24,382 --> 02:02:25,411
TRAVIS: Would you like one?

1998
02:02:25,411 --> 02:02:26,450
TALIESIN: Probably.

1999
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:27,877
LAURA: What if we take a short rest?

2000
02:02:27,877 --> 02:02:34,136
MATT: At the end of the short rest, everyone gains
an additional 1d8. It's nice. Doesn't hurt.

2001
02:02:34,136 --> 02:02:37,501
MARISHA: I come to consciousness by Scanlan's
singing?

2002
02:02:37,501 --> 02:02:42,363
SAM: (singing) You're down with more HP. Yeah, you
know me!

2003
02:02:42,453 --> 02:02:44,401
TALIESIN: That's nice.

2004
02:02:44,449 --> 02:02:45,535
MARISHA: What?

2005
02:02:45,535 --> 02:02:46,716
TRAVIS: Hit dice?

2006
02:02:46,716 --> 02:02:47,940
LAURA: Yeah, we can roll some hit dice.

2007
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,458
MATT: You guys take a short rest here to roll some
hit dice.

2008
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:53,428
MARISHA: (groans) Wait, how much did you heal us,
Scanlan?

2009
02:02:53,428 --> 02:02:57,426
SAM: Just one extra d8. Do I roll that, or do
they?

2010
02:02:57,426 --> 02:02:59,177
MATT: Everyone rolls it on their own. It's fine.

2011
02:02:59,177 --> 02:03:09,554
SAM: Holy ba-Jesus, guys.

2012
02:03:09,554 --> 02:03:10,955
LAURA: That was insane.

2013
02:03:10,955 --> 02:03:12,735
SAM: Can we never do that again?

2014
02:03:12,735 --> 02:03:14,883
LAURA: Well, we're about to, I think.

2015
02:03:14,883 --> 02:03:19,528
LIAM: Who feels like making camp?

2016
02:03:19,528 --> 02:03:21,609
SAM: Making camp?

2017
02:03:21,609 --> 02:03:22,589
LIAM: Yes.

2018
02:03:22,589 --> 02:03:26,062
SAM: We're in a tomb with ghosts. We have to
continue on.

2019
02:03:26,062 --> 02:03:27,357
LIAM: I'm exhausted.

2020
02:03:27,357 --> 02:03:31,600
TALIESIN: We'll heal, but I think we need to
continue down.

2021
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,648
LAURA: We need to keep going.

2022
02:03:33,648 --> 02:03:43,537
MATT: Cassandra looks about the rest of you, still
seeing a group of herself and her brothers. She

2023
02:03:43,537 --> 02:03:48,696
shakes her head for a second. "We can rest a
moment, but I don't think we can stay here much

2024
02:03:48,696 --> 02:03:53,477
"longer. The more time we spend here, the more
chance they have of returning. If they get the

2025
02:03:53,477 --> 02:03:56,436
"jump on us, we're done."

2026
02:03:56,436 --> 02:03:57,816
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2027
02:03:57,816 --> 02:03:59,980
LAURA: We need to press on.

2028
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:02,137
SAM: Yeah, aye.

2029
02:04:02,137 --> 02:04:03,331
MARISHA: Yeah.

2030
02:04:03,331 --> 02:04:04,407
SAM: Let's continue.

2031
02:04:04,407 --> 02:04:05,260
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2032
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:06,901
SAM: Into the tunnel. Into the dark.

2033
02:04:06,901 --> 02:04:15,282
MATT: She sheathes her sword and her dagger.
(sighs) "Let's do this." As you all climb into the

2034
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:20,190
beginning of the excavation tunnel leading to 
the south, slowly making your way towards--

2035
02:04:20,233 --> 02:04:24,807
SAM: Wait! Sorry. Percival, any point in looting?

2036
02:04:24,807 --> 02:04:28,428
TALIESIN: Don't loot my family's crypt!

2037
02:04:28,428 --> 02:04:32,106
SAM: Sorry! Forget I mentioned it. Let's go kick
some ass.

2038
02:04:32,106 --> 02:04:37,821
MATT: Making your way towards the tunnels beneath
the city of Whitestone, towards whatever this

2039
02:04:37,821 --> 02:04:43,976
ziggurat construction project has been, we will
pick this up the week after Thanksgiving.

2040
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:46,250
LAURA: Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from
this.

2041
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:49,579
MATT: Yeah. We went a little late tonight to try
and give a little extra since we're not going to

2042
02:04:49,579 --> 02:04:52,933
be here next week, but that's it for the evening.

2043
02:04:52,975 --> 02:04:57,592
MARISHA: We almost got our ass kicked by ghosts!

2044
02:04:57,592 --> 02:04:59,414
SAM: No, by each other.

2045
02:04:59,414 --> 02:05:00,824
LAURA: We really need a cleric.

2046
02:05:00,824 --> 02:05:05,008
MATT: There were some really bad-- everyone rolled
poorly on those saving throws.

2047
02:05:05,008 --> 02:05:07,077
That sucked. Oh, yes!

2048
02:05:07,077 --> 02:05:09,390
LAURA: Oh, man. Right. Giveaways.

2049
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:13,446
ZAC: We've got to do a giveaway, so I am opening
the floodgates.

2050
02:05:13,446 --> 02:05:16,676
TALIESIN: Welcome, all!

2051
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:18,437
LAURA: The whole time.

2052
02:05:18,437 --> 02:05:25,875
TALIESIN: This is Twitch. Holy cow.

2053
02:05:25,875 --> 02:05:28,781
MARISHA: I might need to burn a Cure Wounds or
something.

2054
02:05:28,781 --> 02:05:30,781
TALIESIN: I'm not at a hundred, but I'm okay.

2055
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:35,751
MARISHA: I burned almost all of my hit dice to
bring me back up.

2056
02:05:35,751 --> 02:05:40,813
TALIESIN: Ashley is getting home right now, in
case we need her.

2057
02:05:40,813 --> 02:05:41,777
LAURA: Yeah.

2058
02:05:41,777 --> 02:05:43,691
MATT: We're good.

2059
02:05:43,691 --> 02:05:45,186
TRAVIS: Are we?

2060
02:05:45,186 --> 02:05:48,550
TALIESIN: Can she come in for 30 seconds and heal
us?

2061
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:51,302
MATT: (laughs) It doesn't work that way.

2062
02:05:51,302 --> 02:05:52,374
TALIESIN: I know.

2063
02:05:52,374 --> 02:05:56,678
MARISHA: Guys, I got a little bit of a connection!
And gone. That's all.

2064
02:05:56,678 --> 02:06:03,549
ZAC: We also got up to $6,000 total so far,
raised.

2065
02:06:03,549 --> 02:06:05,318
LAURA: Oh wow, that's great!

2066
02:06:05,318 --> 02:06:06,454
MATT: Incredible!

2067
02:06:06,454 --> 02:06:10,191
ZAC: So we will continue that throughout the
weekend, all the way up to Monday.

2068
02:06:10,191 --> 02:06:12,675
MATT: Thank you all so much for helping out.

2069
02:06:12,675 --> 02:06:13,737
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

2070
02:06:13,737 --> 02:06:17,388
MATT: You're helping a lot of wonderful people do
a lot of amazing things in places that need it.

2071
02:06:17,388 --> 02:06:23,265
ZAC: So the floodgates are open. We're going to
let that build up for a little bit and then do the

2072
02:06:23,265 --> 02:06:24,357
giveaway.

2073
02:06:24,357 --> 02:06:27,853
MATT: Oh! Chat room explode!

2074
02:06:27,853 --> 02:06:33,320
ZAC: Oh shoot, that's true. The next episode is
Critmas, as well, isn't it?

2075
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:34,631
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

2076
02:06:34,631 --> 02:06:36,168
ZAC: Is there not? There's one before it?

2077
02:06:36,168 --> 02:06:37,470
LAURA: No, there's another one before.

2078
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:38,419
ZAC: Are you sure?

2079
02:06:38,419 --> 02:06:39,314
TALIESIN: No.

2080
02:06:39,314 --> 02:06:48,537
MARISHA: No, we're doing the Christmas Critmas a
little bit earlier, so we're going to do the next

2081
02:06:48,537 --> 02:06:50,481
one before we go on Christmas break, right?

2082
02:06:50,481 --> 02:06:58,205
MATT: No, the 3rd is the next Critmas. Because the
17th, our last show, is also the opening night of

2083
02:06:58,205 --> 02:07:03,052
the new Star Wars movie, we can't go late that
night because everyone's going to be gone.

2084
02:07:03,052 --> 02:07:06,859
LAURA: Oh. So yeah, we can't do Critmas next
week.

2085
02:07:06,859 --> 02:07:09,253
ZAC: Next week's Thanksgiving.

2086
02:07:09,253 --> 02:07:10,911
LAURA: I mean, on the 3rd.

2087
02:07:10,911 --> 02:07:14,488
ZAC: And we've already told everyone the first
week of the month is--

2088
02:07:14,488 --> 02:07:18,523
SAM: So the Christmas Critmas is going to be the
3rd.

2089
02:07:18,523 --> 02:07:19,640
MATT: It's going to be the 3rd.

2090
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:20,522
LAURA: December 3rd?

2091
02:07:20,522 --> 02:07:21,295
ZAC: Yes.

2092
02:07:21,295 --> 02:07:22,549
TALIESIN: Yeah, that will be the Crit--

2093
02:07:22,549 --> 02:07:26,001
ZAC: Math is hard, guys.

2094
02:07:26,001 --> 02:07:28,384
MATT: Welcome to our late-night meetings.

2095
02:07:28,384 --> 02:07:30,390
(all laugh)

2096
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:31,966
ZAC: All right, pull in a winner.

2097
02:07:31,966 --> 02:07:33,332
MATT: We've got a winner coming in.

2098
02:07:33,332 --> 02:07:36,626
LAURA: Can't we just do it the second week? It's
going to be a long episode. We'll have to cut it

2099
02:07:36,626 --> 02:07:37,566
super short.

2100
02:07:37,566 --> 02:07:39,561
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Can we move
it to the second week?

2101
02:07:39,561 --> 02:07:41,531
TALIESIN: Move it to the 10th.

2102
02:07:41,531 --> 02:07:43,391
MARISHA: Christmas Critmas is going to be the
10th.

2103
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:46,582
ZAC: Before we officially say that, let me check
the schedule, because we've already told everyone

2104
02:07:46,582 --> 02:07:50,893
the first week, so before we say that officially,
let me check the schedule and make sure that's

2105
02:07:50,893 --> 02:07:51,705
okay.

2106
02:07:51,705 --> 02:07:53,173
LAURA: It's going to be really hard to do it on
the 3rd.

2107
02:07:53,173 --> 02:07:53,974
ZAC: Okay.

2108
02:07:53,974 --> 02:07:56,113
TALIESIN: I'm literally leaving the studio on the
17th for a road trip.

2109
02:07:56,113 --> 02:07:57,744
ZAC: IEShoemaker is the winner.

2110
02:07:57,744 --> 02:07:59,688
MATT: IEShoemaker, congratulations!

2111
02:07:59,688 --> 02:08:04,554
ZAC: We're sending you a message right now. Send
back with your address and we'll send you all

2112
02:08:04,554 --> 02:08:11,444
sorts of great shit. Tune in tomorrow, guys, for
Group Hug. Hector's bringing a couple of comedian

2113
02:08:11,444 --> 02:08:17,441
friends of his, and they are playing all of the
Jessica Jones Alias characters tomorrow, and

2114
02:08:17,441 --> 02:08:22,959
nobody wanted to play Purple Man.

2115
02:08:22,959 --> 02:08:24,166
MATT: Understandably so.

2116
02:08:24,166 --> 02:08:25,887
TALIESIN: Creepiest character in the Marvel
universe.

2117
02:08:25,887 --> 02:08:27,088
ZAC: How do we do this?

2118
02:08:27,088 --> 02:08:28,334
TALIESIN: He is the creepiest creep.

2119
02:08:28,435 --> 02:08:30,900
ZAC: Whoever plays him has to know you're going to
get your ass kicked.

2120
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:31,975
MATT: That's Tennant, right?

2121
02:08:31,975 --> 02:08:36,838
TALIESIN: That's Tennant. That's also who I
dressed up as at the superhero party. I painted

2122
02:08:36,838 --> 02:08:38,191
myself purple.

2123
02:08:38,191 --> 02:08:40,206
ZAC: You did Purple Man? Why would you do that?!

2124
02:08:40,206 --> 02:08:43,961
TALIESIN: There's an amazing photo of a friend of
ours dressed as Luke Cage, just beating the shit

2125
02:08:43,961 --> 02:08:45,062
out of me. It's amazing.

2126
02:08:45,062 --> 02:08:46,157
ZAC: Well, that's good.

2127
02:08:46,157 --> 02:08:47,847
MARISHA: He also sang Gogol Bordello's--

2128
02:08:47,847 --> 02:08:49,210
MARISHA and TALIESIN: "Start Wearing Purple."

2129
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:50,877
MATT: It was good.

2130
02:08:50,877 --> 02:08:52,587
TALIESIN: It was creepy.

2131
02:08:52,587 --> 02:08:56,906
MATT: I'm just excited to see all the Doctor Who
Tennant fans watch the series for Tennant and then

2132
02:08:56,906 --> 02:08:59,905
be like, "Oh no, no, no!"

2133
02:08:59,905 --> 02:09:04,516
ZAC: Yeah. Sorry, guys. No bueno.

2134
02:09:04,516 --> 02:09:06,727
TALIESIN: It's just going to be bad.

2135
02:09:06,727 --> 02:09:09,169
ZAC: Sweet. That's it for tonight, guys.

2136
02:09:09,169 --> 02:09:10,358
MATT: Thank you guys so much.

2137
02:09:10,358 --> 02:09:12,179
MARISHA: See you in two weeks!

2138
02:09:12,179 --> 02:09:14,000
MATT: For the next episode. See you guys in two weeks.

2139
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,138
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!

2140
02:09:15,138 --> 02:09:21,414
MARISHA: There will still be a new comic next week
to hold you guys over. And playlists. Guess whose

2141
02:09:21,457 --> 02:09:22,933
playlist is next.

2142
02:09:22,933 --> 02:09:24,885
TRAVIS: Oh, is it mine?

2143
02:09:24,885 --> 02:09:26,187
MARISHA: You're the last one, right?

2144
02:09:26,187 --> 02:09:27,457
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm the Thanksgiving playlist.

2145
02:09:27,457 --> 02:09:28,962
SAM: Does the DM get a playlist?

2146
02:09:28,962 --> 02:09:29,895
MATT: I get one.

2147
02:09:29,895 --> 02:09:31,807
MARISHA: He does, but he'll go last. Because you
always go last.

2148
02:09:31,807 --> 02:09:34,385
MATT: All right, guys. Thank you so much. Have a
wonderful evening.

2149
02:09:34,385 --> 02:09:35,463
We'll see you in a couple of weeks.

2150
02:09:35,463 --> 02:09:36,241
MARISHA: Bye!

2151
02:09:36,241 --> 02:09:37,129
SAM: Happy Thanksgiving.

2152
02:09:37,129 --> 02:09:39,123
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!
