1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:03,896
MATT: Hello, and good evening everyone, to
tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:11,158
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight's going to be an

3
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:15,609
interesting evening based on how we left off last
week, so we'll get to that here in a moment. First

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:20,709
and foremost, let's get through our announcements.
At the top, we are excited. This episode and the

5
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:24,652
episodes of this month are brought to you by our
new sponsor for this month, Loot Crate.

6
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:27,375
(cheering)

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:31,577
MATT: Me and Marisha have been Loot Crate--

8
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,644
MARISHA: --purveyors for like three years.

9
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:39,805
MATT: But they've been awesome enough and
interested in helping us sponsor this next month

10
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:44,171
of content, so that being the case, if we want to
go ahead and open some of these boxes real fast,

11
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:50,571
and see, so you're aware of the kind of stuff that
Loot Crate does. While they're opening this, Loot

12
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:56,196
Crate is a monthly subscription box service that's
20 bucks a month and you get six to eight unique

13
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,653
items that are based on a specific theme every
month.

14
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,299
LAURA: Leeloo Dallas Multipass!

15
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:08,472
TALIESIN: This is the one that comes with the
Harry Potter socks.

16
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:11,001
LAURA: Sorry, Matt, you were talking.

17
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,466
MATT: That's okay. You guys show off what you
got.

18
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,094
LIAM: I have a little cute facehugger for the
face.

19
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,372
MARISHA: Yes, a drinking horn!

20
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:31,241
SAM: I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should
rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month.

21
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,511
I'm just saying.

22
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,778
MATT: No, I'm good. I'm good on that, thank you.

23
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,863
TALIESIN: This fabulous Labyrinth t-shirt, which
Travis is sporting.

24
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:49,558
TRAVIS: I think if David Bowie can't keep you
alive, I don't know what can. Original War of the

25
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,060
Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still prints?

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,199
MATT: So, the cool thing about this is, they send
you a new crate every month that has a certain

27
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,776
theme and the content in that is based around that
theme. If you go to

28
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:11,349
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole, you can enter the
code 'criticalrole', one word, to save $3 on your

29
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,861
new subscription, so if you're thinking about it
and you want to try it out for a little while, go

30
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:19,599
ahead and use our code and get yourself a nice
little discount, which is rad.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,940
LIAM: The other neat thing about Loot Crate boxes
is you can turn them inside out and they become

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,016
something. This one's an arcade machine.

33
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,956
MARISHA: This one's got a maze on the inside.

34
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,022
TALIESIN: I keep all my stuff in these boxes.

35
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,956
MARISHA: Yeah, they're good storage boxes. Or
regifting boxes.

36
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:36,109
MATT: That the invasion box?

37
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:40,797
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest
box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet.

38
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,665
MATT: Not yet, power box, I think, is this month.

39
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:49,070
ASHLEY: There's so much X-Files stuff in here.
This is awesome.

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,259
MATT: (laughs) That was a good month.

41
00:02:51,259 --> 00:03:00,125
LAURA: I think May is World of Warcraft, DBZ. It's
got all these amazing things and I was like, I'm a

42
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,420
part of all of these things and I want it!

43
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:10,517
MATT: I like how it's essentially a really tiny
pre-stream Critmas.

44
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:20,820
SAM: Guys, you could watch us open stuff all
night.

45
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,709
MATT: I've already lost control of the episode.

46
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,452
TRAVIS: Go to Loot Crate, click the link. Show
some love.

47
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:33,084
MATT: So, yeah, lootcrate.com/criticalrole. You
can put in 'criticalrole' as your code there and

48
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,778
you'll get 3% off your subscription.

49
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:36,063
MARISHA: $3 off.

50
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:44,583
MATT: Or yeah, sorry, $3, not 3%. Much better than
3%. I'm so stupid. $3. It's awesome. Thank you,

51
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:53,227
Loot Crate! Next announcement we have, for those
who missed it previously, it is now available: the

52
00:03:53,227 --> 00:04:02,862
latest issue of Rat Queens, in which Vox Machina
make a cameo appearance during a certain bar-crawl

53
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:11,099
portion of the issue. And some wayward bard ends
up trying to buy a drink for one of the members.

54
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,619
TRAVIS: He's got glorious hair, though.

55
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,965
MATT: He has glorious hair, which, mine is shorter
now, but it'll grow. Don't worry, those of you who

56
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:21,814
freaked out. I've already gotten people who're
like, "You cut it!" and I'm like, "It's hair! I

57
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,918
"live in the Valley where it's hot."

58
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,101
LAURA: Well, it's not really hot right now.

59
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:33,761
MATT: Yeah, not today. Today, the weather's been
nice. So, yeah, next up on the list, Taliesin.

60
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:39,250
Supposedly, for those who haven't seen it, the
next run on Signal Boost, the show that Marisha

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,255
writes and produces for, has a new person hosting
the next series of episodes.

62
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:49,871
TALIESIN: Who's hosting the new series-- Oh, fuck.
I'd better start working on that right now. Oh.

63
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:56,932
It's going to be great. No, I'm having a lot of
fun. We're putting it together, and--

64
00:04:56,932 --> 00:05:02,034
MARISHA: It's going to be weird. We're going even
weirder. So for everyone who already hates how

65
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,452
weird it is, buckle up.

66
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:17,007
MATT: All right, so, look for that. All right.
Also, there is a new series of Geek and Sundry

67
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:24,036
website content coming up called Ask Vox Machina,
in which Vox Machina members have been written to

68
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:29,854
by various people living in the world of
Tal'Dorei, asking how to solve their problems. Our

69
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:33,348
wondrous players here are answering them in
character. I believe the first one is going to be

70
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,625
Sam, right?

71
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:41,768
SAM: Yeah, Scanlan got some great letters from the
fans, and he replied with some award-winning

72
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:45,920
advice. So, check that out tomorrow on
geekandsundry.com.

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,373
TALIESIN: Participation awards all around.

74
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:50,712
MATT: (laughs) Did you say anticipation awards?

75
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:51,719
TALIESIN: Participation.

76
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:58,843
MATT: Oh, I like anticipation awards, too. There's
a video game that some people may have heard of

77
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:04,692
called Uncharted 4 that's coming out. Reviews have
been coming out and everyone's giving it the best

78
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:06,086
game of forever.

79
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:07,365
LAURA: It's amazing!

80
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:12,674
MATT: So, and I believe one of our own Vox Machina
plays a rather awesome role in that, Laura?

81
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:14,889
(cheering)

82
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,208
MATT: Nadine Ross in the story.

83
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,866
LAURA: Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face
off with her. It's really fun.

84
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,092
MATT: That is exciting.

85
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,454
LIAM: You are a good actor.

86
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:29,669
MATT: And in the multiplayer you might hear me try
and kill you a couple times.

87
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,559
LIAM: Yeah, kill him a lot for what he's about to
do!

88
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,449
SAM: You also might hear me try to heal you a
couple times.

89
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,899
MATT: Okay, so between us, we got you.

90
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,968
LAURA: That's right, I remember when we were going
in for multiplayer, it was like, we've got several

91
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,848
members of Vox Machina as the multiplayer
characters, which is pretty ridiculous.

92
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:55,915
MATT: Should be fun. All right. Also, we put the
new full title intro on Facebook yesterday, so you

93
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:02,221
guys can get it in hi-def glory at your request.
And we've already hit a million views on it in a day.

94
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,034
TRAVIS: (laughs) Which is weird.

95
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,912
LIAM: Dungeons and Dragons!

96
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:14,921
MATT: It's a good time when you can dress up as
your D&amp;D characters for a weekend and people on

97
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,763
Facebook are like, cool. Like, that's the weirdest
thing ever.

98
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,781
TALIESIN: A million people go, huh.

99
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:22,355
MATT: Huh. That's a thing. (laughs)

100
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,684
LAURA: Although I did get made fun of already.

101
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:25,747
MATT: Did you?

102
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,672
LAURA: Some fan pointed out that I looked stupid.

103
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,291
MATT: Did they really?

104
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,603
SAM: I wouldn't call that person a fan,
necessarily.

105
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:38,515
MATT: They say that (funny voice) I love the intro
but Laura Bailey looks stupid.

106
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:40,984
LAURA: (fake cries)

107
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:42,551
SAM: I'm sorry I wrote that.

108
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,677
LAURA: It was Sam.

109
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:53,087
MATT: All right, last couple things here. The
title song actually for that intro, written by our

110
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:58,144
wondrous friend of the show, Jason Charles Miller,
who you saw play as Garthok, the half-orc rogue a

111
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,399
number of episodes back, who wrote our original
theme and the new one, has it up on iTunes. So if

112
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,424
you want to have the most badass, nerdy ringtone
and/or music to play on repeat until you start

113
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:12,597
bleeding out of your nose, that is now available
on iTunes, so you can search for the Critical Role

114
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:17,969
intro music. It's awesome. All right, Liam, you
want to take it away?

115
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:25,025
LIAM: We've come a long way to get here tonight.
It's true we may die, and when our bones are

116
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:32,697
turned to dust, carry them away in Wyrmwood gaming
boxes, the finest wooden boxes for carrying the

117
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:37,343
remains of the dead ever. They're great! Oh and
you can put dice in 'em too, which is probably

118
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:41,839
their intended purpose. And if you like them, they
have many different kinds of woods, you go to

119
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,101
wyrmwoodgaming.com. And if you want to pay for
shipping, you can, but if you don't want to pay

120
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:49,135
for shipping, use the code 'critrole'.

121
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:51,104
ALL: Critrole!

122
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:55,983
LIAM: Feels so good. And you'll get free shipping.
And then also, lastly, this is the last couple of

123
00:08:55,983 --> 00:09:02,501
hours for their kickstarter for the sentinel box.
You can get our logo onto any box, like this, or

124
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:10,293
you can get the real swag and get the master box.
It looks like this on any wood. And you put your

125
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,054
dice in it, cards in it.

126
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:19,424
ASHLEY: My favorite part of Wyrmwood Gaming is the
magnets. Magnets, bitch!

127
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:20,990
(laughter)

128
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,529
MATT: It's so satisfying.

129
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:30,704
LIAM: So, that kickstarter, a couple more hours,
then finito if you want to get in on that. Okay.

130
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,490
MATT: Cool. And last but not least on my list, it
says 'death to all puppies'. I don't know who

131
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,530
wrote that.

132
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,099
TRAVIS: Who would write that?

133
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,828
LAURA: It was you, Matt. It was you!

134
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:48,836
MATT: I'm going to assume it's Sam. It's usually
Sam. All right. Well, then, let's go ahead and

135
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:58,252
bring this down now to get in the mood for
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

136
00:09:58,252 --> 00:11:30,298
[dramatic music]

137
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:38,267
MATT: Welcome back. So! Leaving off from last
week's episode, the party of intrepid adventurers,

138
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:43,521
Vox Machina, trying to save the whole of Tal'Dorei
from the Chroma Conclave, a collection of

139
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:47,961
chromatic dragons that have destroyed many of the
main cities here, have gone about searching for

140
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:51,977
items called the Vestiges of Divergence, magical
artifacts from a war of ancient times that

141
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:57,290
apparently hold some great power that could aid in
defeating these dragons. One of which, apparently,

142
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:06,034
is being held by Kevdak, the leader of the herd of
roaming tribal barbaric individuals that Grog once

143
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:13,065
belonged to, and had beaten the crap out of and
left Grog for dead long ago. While the dragons had

144
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,816
destroyed part of Westruun and left it behind,
this tribe utilized that time to take over the

145
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:23,207
town, enslaving or keeping most of the people
under their thumb, and making an accord with the

146
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:28,964
one black dragon, Umbrasyl, that is currently in a
tenuous relationship right now with these herd

147
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:38,248
members, Herd of the Storm, as they're known. You,
having sent a few of them to their death via a

148
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:43,822
trap on the outside, found your way into the city,
saved some of the individuals that lived there, as

149
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:51,608
well as Kaylie and Dr. Dranzel, and Grog went
ahead and issued a challenge to the Herd to meet

150
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:58,663
with Kevdak himself. After some fairly decent
intimidation checks, it was agreed, and while most

151
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:02,953
of the party stealthed behind, you made your way
to the very center of the town square, where

152
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:11,048
Kevdak leapt off the top of the ex-Margrave's
homestead and the two of you began to do battle in

153
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:15,489
a pit of spikes that was gathered in the center of
the town square, surrounded by a number of the

154
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:23,564
clan watching on. During this fight, it went back
and forth a bit before Grog felt that this was a

155
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:29,109
losing battle should it continue in this way and
decided to, at least it seemed to me, call out to

156
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:37,862
his friends for aid with the classic Shakespearean
battle cry of, "Vox Machina, fuck shit up!"

157
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,475
LIAM: That's from Coriolanus.

158
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:44,305
MATT: Oh, sorry, Coriolanus, thank you. And that
is where we're picking up. So--

159
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:51,311
SAM: Before we go, I have to inspire everyone with
this.

160
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:55,297
(laughter)

161
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,756
MATT: Holy shit. What the-- what?

162
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:02,653
TALIESIN: What are you? What the fuck are you? Oh
my God!

163
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,341
LIAM: I want a d10!

164
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:12,351
SAM: And look, Ashley's, like, somewhere, I can't
even see.

165
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:18,271
MATT: Please tell me that was a gift from
somebody.

166
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:25,669
SAM: No, I made this myself, because I wanted you
all to know how passionate I was about tonight.

167
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:29,508
LIAM: Sam? Could you kiss your right gun?

168
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:33,796
ASHLEY: Kiss it! Kiss it!

169
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:43,864
SAM: Mm. Tastes like strawberries. And sweat.

170
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:48,952
MATT: Inspiration granted and immediately taken
away.

171
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:52,067
TRAVIS: Do your pants also have photoshopped
lightning coming out of the crotch?

172
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,687
SAM: No, my pants are just jeans.

173
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:56,125
ASHLEY: Wait, how far down does it go?

174
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,974
SAM: All the way, baby.

175
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:02,867
MATT: That's the first step of the process. The
pants come soon.

176
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,783
LAURA: Did you just do that at home with a--?

177
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,576
SAM: Yeah, I just penciled it in.

178
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:18,728
MATT: I can't even. That's a thing. All righty,
so, with that, we are going into the realm of

179
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:27,240
battle. Let's go ahead and kick on the proper
music for this. So, with Vox Machina currently on

180
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,099
the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of
this building, we have the four archers that have

181
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,575
appeared on the rooftop of the Margrave's house.
We have most of the individuals that are

182
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:43,032
surrounding this, along with the few innocents,
which just for the sake of appearance, here, I

183
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:46,168
will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few
markers so you know who you're looking for,

184
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,956
innocents-wise.

185
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:50,475
LIAM: We're the innocents, Matt. We're the
innocents.

186
00:15:50,475 --> 00:16:02,101
MATT: No, you're not. Not anymore. All right, so,
the red markers are going to act as markers for

187
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:07,129
the innocent, just so you're aware.

188
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:20,096
TRAVIS: Percy. Percy! Taliesin! You're on that
roof, right?

189
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:32,162
MATT: Percy's over there. All righty, so, that all
being the case, guys, as Grog shouted, at this

190
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:39,597
moment the individuals in the center of the square
start looking around, confused, not knowing where

191
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:46,256
to come from. At this moment, a few of them manage
to catch up a glance at the individuals that are

192
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:50,048
on the rooftops. I need everyone to roll
initiative, along with you, Grog, because combat

193
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,400
has begun again at this point at the top.

194
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,681
MARISHA: Wait, all of us?

195
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,275
MATT: All of you guys. This has started.

196
00:16:57,275 --> 00:17:12,134
TALIESIN: I mean, that's not amazing. That's
better. 14.

197
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:24,221
MARISHA: You're still ahead of me. You rolled a
nat 20?

198
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:30,051
ASHLEY: Why's he laughing?

199
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,715
TRAVIS: Because he's fucking evil.

200
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,516
MATT: 'Because he's fucking evil'? Is that what
you said?

201
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:38,304
TRAVIS: Who said that? I will beat him with my
fists.

202
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:45,825
MATT: All right, so, for the sake of this one, we
have 25 to 20.

203
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,727
LAURA: 27.

204
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:51,306
LIAM: 24.

205
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:54,284
SAM: 21.

206
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:57,505
MATT: 21, okay, so we have-- let's see.

207
00:17:57,505 --> 00:18:03,728
LIAM: All the people who wanted to go first are
going first.

208
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:06,884
MATT: All right, 20 to 15?

209
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,941
TRAVIS: 18.

210
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:22,923
MATT: All righty. 15 to ten.

211
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:24,713
TALIESIN: 14.

212
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,130
MARISHA: 13.

213
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,781
ASHLEY: 12.

214
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,790
MATT: Pike, getting into the double-digits!

215
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,855
ASHLEY: Oh, you know. Moving on up.

216
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,935
TALIESIN: I'd rather have my low roll here than
for anything else.

217
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:41,477
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

218
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:47,890
TRAVIS: It's like a roller coaster. We're just
going tick-tick-tick-tick-shooom.

219
00:18:47,890 --> 00:19:07,197
MATT: A lot here I'm keeping track of, guys. All
right, so, the surprise round affects all the

220
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:15,235
archers. It affects everyone except for these four
individuals, or these two individuals with the

221
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:28,034
clubs, and these two women here with big swords,
and Kevdak. So, top of the round, Vex.

222
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:33,514
LAURA: Does the second story of the house that I'm
in have windows? Can I see?

223
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,715
MATT: The second story does.

224
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:41,752
LAURA: Can I run up the stairs, then, so I can get
a better look at the playing field?

225
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:47,376
MATT: Actually, this one was supposed to go this
way for the entrance point there. All right. So

226
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:50,631
you are currently now looking out the side of the
window.

227
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:59,180
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to-- I'm already hiding,
right?

228
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,671
MATT: Right, no one's seen you at this point.

229
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:07,582
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark
Kevdak. And I'm going to hold my turn--

230
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:11,043
MATT: Putting a green on him for the Hunter's
Mark.

231
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:18,347
LAURA: I'm going to hold my turn until it seems
like he's better incapacitated or until something

232
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:20,467
happens. I'm going to hold my turn.

233
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:21,952
MATT: Hold your action until--?

234
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:26,750
LAURA: I think until Scanlan goes.

235
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,548
MATT: Okay, so that finishes your turn. Vax,
you're up.

236
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:36,266
LIAM: Am I at a window as well, downstairs?

237
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:37,939
MATT: You are by a door.

238
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:41,378
LIAM: Am I half on a street? In a door?

239
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:45,488
MATT: You're inside the house right now. The door
is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in.

240
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:52,266
LIAM: All right, I'm going to click my boots,
crack the door a few inches, and I'm going to hold

241
00:20:52,266 --> 00:21:00,737
my turn until one of our magic-users pulls a trick
or Kevdak takes a swing at Grog.

242
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:09,039
MATT: Okay. That'll end your current actions.
The archers are surprised. They do not go. It is

243
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:17,442
Kevdak's turn. Kevdak sees you shouting out. He
rolled a natural 20 on his initiative.

244
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,791
LAURA: No, he didn't! That's why you shook your
fucking head.

245
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,837
MATT: Yeah. I was like, man, all right. Let's
start this right.

246
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:25,234
MARISHA: Fucking Wheaton!

247
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:32,395
MATT: They had Wheaton come in and touch all my
stuff. All right, so he's going to go ahead and,

248
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:41,207
seeing you shout like this, he looks about for a
second. He's going to continue his rage. He

249
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:52,538
glances about, looks over and he sees nothing
immediately on the rooftops, but looks down at

250
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:58,109
this individual now shouting out for help before
him, prostrate, and he gives you a glance and

251
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:06,409
says, "Well this seems real familiar, doesn't it,
Strongjaw?" At which point he's going to go ahead

252
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:24,855
and take two of his reckless attacks against you.
That's going to be a 28 to hit.

253
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:27,395
TRAVIS: I'll have to look, but I think it hits.

254
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:31,900
MATT: Yeah. Second attack is a 30 to hit.

255
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,637
TRAVIS: These aren't Great Weapon Master, right?

256
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:35,451
MATT: No, these are not Great Weapon Master.

257
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:41,681
LAURA: What is his attack fucking bonus?

258
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:45,668
TALIESIN: At least ten.

259
00:22:45,668 --> 00:23:06,622
MATT: You take 30 points of slashing damage,
reduced to 15. And two points of necrotic damage,

260
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:15,779
because it's not reduced. And second one's going
to be 22 points of slashing damage, reduced to 11,

261
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,736
and then five points of necrotic on top of that.

262
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:25,648
SAM: However, for the second slash, I'm going to
use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.

263
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:31,199
TRAVIS: Before he does that, you said 17 on the
first one, 11 on the second attack, and how much

264
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,645
necrotic on the second one?

265
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:37,725
LAURA: Seven overall. Plus two necrotic on the
first hit. Five necrotic on the second.

266
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:46,173
MATT: You might have to get a little bit closer to
make sure that he can hear you.

267
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:49,428
LAURA: Plus that would be giving away your
hiding.

268
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,846
MATT: What're you going to do, Sam?

269
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:58,152
SAM: I step forward closer to him and I use
Cutting Words.

270
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:03,393
MATT: Okay, you step to the very edge of the
rooftop here.

271
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:04,894
LAURA: Oh god.

272
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:07,038
MATT: We'll say for the sake of this, right
there.

273
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:15,033
SAM: And I shout, oi, Kevdak! I have a message
from the people of Westruun! And I moon him.

274
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,839
(laughter)

275
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,991
SAM: And I say, kiss our metaphorical hairy
arses!

276
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:29,538
MATT: Just like that on your shirt. As he brings
around his axe for a second swing, he hears that

277
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:35,302
and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny
gnome butt up on the top. Continuing the swing,

278
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,748
though, to attack. Go ahead and reduce the damage
using your Cutting Words.

279
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,295
SAM: Ten, right?

280
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:41,442
MATT: Uh-huh.

281
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,785
SAM: Pff. One.

282
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:55,186
MATT: So you take ten points of slashing damage
from that strike. Oh, you're wielding Mythcarver,

283
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:58,225
so his next saving throw is at disadvantage,
right?

284
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,376
SAM: Yes, it is.

285
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:07,326
MATT: Because you're not currently wielding your
weapon, Kevdak's going to go ahead and take a step

286
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:16,423
back and glance over at you, as he's going to move
his fingers up and point towards the roof. And you

287
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:20,937
see a bunch of the other entities and archers,
whoosh, shift their attention over in your

288
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:29,529
direction, Sam. All right, that finishes Kevdak's
turn. Scanlan, you're up next. Actually, you do

289
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,628
get an attack of opportunity on him with your
fist. Because you're not holding your warhammer

290
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:36,022
right now.

291
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:40,242
TRAVIS: I rolled a five, plus what? My strength?

292
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:43,738
MATT: I mean, it's your strength modifier plus
your proficiency modifier.

293
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:46,987
TRAVIS: 13?

294
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:55,980
MATT: 13, no. You punch his back and it just hits
off his muscle. All right. Sam, you're up.

295
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,960
SAM: Okay. From my crouched, butt-out position,
whilst holding my Hand Cone of Clarity.

296
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,724
MATT: Where are you holding it?

297
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,969
SAM: It's shoved up there.

298
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,359
LIAM: Between the legs, upside-down.

299
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:22,076
SAM: Before I make this attack, when I scanned
around, did I see any of his allies without any

300
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:25,483
weapons or carrying a staff or something like
that?

301
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:35,559
MATT: No, they're all the type of people that
would be at all times wielding something at their

302
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,180
side. There are two individuals that you do
notice, there is this one here, and there is

303
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:48,152
Greenbeard right there, and they both appear to
have some sort of a quarterstaff-type implement,

304
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:52,114
but everything else is either bladed or giant
clubs or some sort of big melee weapon.

305
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:53,665
SAM: But they're surprised anyway.

306
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:54,651
MATT: They are, yes.

307
00:26:54,651 --> 00:27:01,449
SAM: Okay. Okay. Well, then, I will cast Hold
Person at level three on Kevdak.

308
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:02,598
MATT: On Kevdak.

309
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:03,661
SAM: Yes.

310
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,885
MATT: Oh boy.

311
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,972
SAM: At level three, so I get to target one other
individual.

312
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,868
MATT: You would, yeah.

313
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:15,540
SAM: And I would target the beardy guy with the
staff.

314
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:24,680
MATT: All right, Hold Person. For a minute, wisdom
saving throw, for the duration. Okay.

315
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,255
SAM: Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage.

316
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:30,730
MATT: With disadvantage, yes, that is true.
Kevdak. All right.

317
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,273
SAM: Because of Cutting Words.

318
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:42,395
MATT: He rolled a 19 and an eight. Taking the
eight, that brings it to a ten, so that's a

319
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,783
failure on him.

320
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:45,418
(cheering)

321
00:27:45,418 --> 00:27:53,627
LAURA: For Hold Person, does it un-paralyze him if
we hit him?

322
00:27:53,627 --> 00:28:01,881
SAM: No. He's just paralyzed. You can have at him.
And can I still move and do other things?

323
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:06,525
MATT: You can in a moment. We have to figure out
if the other guy makes his save. He rolls a

324
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:07,752
natural one.

325
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,324
LAURA: Yay!

326
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:12,328
MATT: Aw, man, the rest of these people are going
to be real pissed.

327
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:14,872
LIAM: This is where my held turn comes in.

328
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:16,422
LAURA: Me too, but I was in front of you.

329
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:18,044
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

330
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,351
TRAVIS: If you hit him, does he become not
paralyzed?

331
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:21,698
LIAM: No, he's stuck.

332
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:27,109
MATT: Yes. At the end of each of his turns, the
target can make another wisdom saving throw. And

333
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:32,566
paralyzed, for those who are aware what
paralyzation does, a paralyzed creature is

334
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:36,320
incapacitated and cannot speak, automatically
fails strength and dexterity saving throws,

335
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,674
attacks rolls have advantage, and any attack that
hits the target is a critical hit if it's within

336
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,038
five feet of the creature.

337
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,617
LAURA: Oh, five feet. Damn it. Oh, but that's good
for Grog. Okay.

338
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:47,505
SAM: Okay, wait. I still get my move, right?

339
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:48,467
MATT: You do.

340
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:52,493
SAM: Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys?
Is there anything I can duck behind?

341
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:54,703
MATT: You can duck behind the other side of this
roof if you'd like.

342
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:58,161
SAM: And still maintain sight? Oh, wait, no, I'd
be more than 60 feet away.

343
00:28:58,161 --> 00:29:04,284
MATT: I mean, it's more the casting time. You can
still move away once you've cast the spell and

344
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,459
hold it there.

345
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:11,013
SAM: Okay. Then I'll duck back behind some cover.
And as my bonus, I still get a bonus, I will

346
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:17,630
inspire Grog and I'll say, Grog! Now it's your
turn to fuck shit up.

347
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,560
(laughter)

348
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,962
SAM: All right.

349
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:23,338
MATT: And that finishes your turn, Scanlan?

350
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:24,320
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

351
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,488
MATT: Grog, you're up.

352
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:26,821
TRAVIS: He's paralyzed.

353
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:33,773
MATT: You watch as he steps away from you, points
up, and all the archers turn towards that,

354
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:40,122
everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you
hear a cacophony of voices around growling, before

355
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:46,075
Kevdak takes another step and (grunts). And you
see the gleaming ass of Scanlan in the distance,

356
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:55,016
the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale,
sun-dappled, gnomish skin. These two round globes

357
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:57,796
of victory staring down from the rooftop.

358
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,383
SAM: Round globes of victory! I love it.

359
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,779
TRAVIS: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak?

360
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,791
MATT: Do you want to pick up your weapon first,
or?

361
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:06,977
TRAVIS: No.

362
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,796
MATT: Nope? Okay.

363
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:10,599
LIAM: Do the twins go first or does Grog go
first?

364
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,963
MATT: Oh right, because you held your actions, so,
up to you.

365
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:16,770
SAM: Okay, do your thing, do your thing.

366
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,090
LIAM: I'm going to go.

367
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,308
LAURA: I'm going to go.

368
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:23,517
MATT: Yep. All right. So. We have now Vex, taking
your shots.

369
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:27,067
LAURA: Yes. Yes. I'm going to shoot from my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So that's three

370
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:28,557
attacks on the first attack.

371
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:32,441
MATT: Yes, and they all have advantage because
he's paralyzed. This is bad for Kevdak, but we'll

372
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,802
see how it works.

373
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,151
LAURA: Okay, so.

374
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:37,320
MATT: Still raging, so everything's half-damage.

375
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,733
LAURA: So 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first
attack.

376
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,099
MATT: Yeah, that does.

377
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:46,512
LAURA: Okay. 19 plus 12 hits on the second.

378
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,833
MATT: Yep.

379
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,405
LAURA: And 17 plus 12 hits on the third?

380
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:51,537
MATT: Yeah, they all hit.

381
00:30:51,537 --> 00:31:06,860
LAURA: Okay. I'm adjusting my glasses, I'm so
nervous. Okay. 28 on the first hit.

382
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,924
MATT: 28, reduced to 14, okay.

383
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:17,739
LAURA: 21 on the second hit.

384
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:21,483
ASHLEY: Get him, baby.

385
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:27,041
LAURA: 16 on the third hit.

386
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:31,384
MATT: Okay, that reduces to eight. All the arrows
strike true, thump-thump-thump, but still each one

387
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:38,184
is only piercing the flesh so far, he's generally
so dense in his musculature, each impact is not

388
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:45,318
having the same satisfying (impact) sound you're
used to. But that ends your held action and it is

389
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,641
now your turn.

390
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:48,164
LAURA: Oh, but I get another attack, because
that's just one attack.

391
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:50,549
MATT: Oh right, that was the sky sentinel, go for
it. Take a second attack.

392
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:56,210
LAURA: My second attack, I'm going to take at
Greenbeard, and I'm going to shoot through the

393
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,193
flaming bowstring.

394
00:31:58,193 --> 00:31:59,657
MATT: Okay.

395
00:31:59,657 --> 00:32:07,099
LAURA: 17 plus 12 probably hits? 17 plus 12?

396
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,416
MATT: Yeah, that's going to hit.

397
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:19,760
LAURA: Okay. Gah! 14 on that one.

398
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,973
MATT: 14, okay. 14 damage to him. Greenbeard is
currently stuck there in place, the arrow sinks

399
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:30,573
into his robe and you don't even see the impact,
it absorbs into the cloth and he goes, ah, and you

400
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,623
hear the escaping air from the impact but he can't
actually move.

401
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:35,364
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark.

402
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:37,806
LAURA: I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked
already.

403
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,107
TALIESIN: Okay.

404
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:41,344
MATT: At this point, you'd better.

405
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,700
TALIESIN: We're not panicking, no, not at all.

406
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,796
LAURA: Not at all. Hunter's Mark! I did it, I
swear!

407
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,070
MATT: All right. You're up.

408
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:52,141
LIAM: Just to verify, because Kevdak is still
raging, am I denied the surprise attack from

409
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:53,408
inside here?

410
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:54,527
MATT: Correct.

411
00:32:54,527 --> 00:33:02,518
LIAM: Okay. So I'm going to use sharpshooter and
drop five to hit harder, I'm going to throw a

412
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:05,778
dagger at advantage, yeah?

413
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:07,334
MATT: So you're moving up into the doorway.

414
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:08,988
LIAM: Yeah, to the doorway, right, so the first--

415
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,266
MATT: Who are you attacking?

416
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,676
LIAM: Kevdak. 60 feet.

417
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,994
MATT: 60 feet, you'd, okay, yeah, you can get
right into there and probably still hit him from

418
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,864
there. Because you have sharpshooter, you don't
have the second increment range, go for it.

419
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:19,289
LIAM: Okay, so it's 25.

420
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,513
MATT: That hits.

421
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:27,230
LIAM: Four, oh, hold on, I'll save that four. 20.
Okay.

422
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:36,372
TRAVIS: My hands are fucking shaking.

423
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:43,240
LIAM: (counting) 31, 37.

424
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,720
MATT: 37. And half of that is going to put it at
18.

425
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,956
LIAM: Okay. I'd like to use my bonus action to
throw the next--

426
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:54,285
MATT: You had the held-- a held action is just
your action.

427
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:56,035
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you did the clicking the boots of
haste already.

428
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,242
LIAM: I thought that was a gimme-- oh, that's the
bonus action?

429
00:33:58,242 --> 00:34:04,402
MATT: Well, the idea being that when you hold your
action, you have an action that you hold until it

430
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:08,918
triggers. The bonus action's a whole different
thing that you have to take on your turn.

431
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,370
LIAM: So taking a hold is an action? I don't
understand.

432
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,001
SAM: Holding your turn loses your bonus action.

433
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:20,579
MATT: Yes, essentially you have your action and
your bonus action. Holding your action means you

434
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,296
hold that one bit of it but your turn still
continues past it.

435
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:28,900
LIAM: Okay. Which doorway, where am I on the map,
I can't see myself? Right there? Could I run to

436
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,615
the corner of the building that the archers are on
and scrabble up the side of it?

437
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:33,792
MATT: Over here?

438
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:34,904
LIAM: And get to that archer?

439
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,151
MATT: You can certain try it.

440
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,894
(laughter)

441
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:41,098
MATT: You rush past one of the peasants, fear in
their face, they're confused and looking around

442
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:44,304
and you see there's mud and a little trickle of
blood that's dried down their face. As you

443
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:47,801
(darting noise) by, they go, (gasps) You don't pay
too much mind to them.

444
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:52,086
LIAM: Acrobatics check?

445
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:53,530
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

446
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,787
LIAM: 30.

447
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:58,642
MATT: 30. You manage to make it up to the top.

448
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:00,668
LIAM: Do I have an action left?

449
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,142
MATT: No, you used your action.

450
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:05,920
LIAM: Action, action, bonus action with the hasted
boots?

451
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,385
MATT: Technically, you wouldn't be able to move at
this point even, but I'm letting you do that.

452
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:11,977
Usually your move, it's a little weird.

453
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,329
LIAM: Okay, so I'm outta gas.

454
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:14,229
MATT: So yeah.

455
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,083
TRAVIS: This is the most epic map ever, by the
way.

456
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:23,271
MATT: Trinket's just chilling in the house. (sad
bear noise) All righty. So that ends your held

457
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,992
action, now Grog, you're up.

458
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:29,703
TRAVIS: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak,
please?

459
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:31,066
MATT: Okay.

460
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:41,120
TRAVIS: Knowing that he pointed up with a hand at
Scanlan's beautiful ass, hand still on his

461
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:49,143
greataxe, paralyzed, can I try and rip--
continuing my rage because he hit me last round--

462
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,670
can I pull the axe from his hand?

463
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,014
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

464
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,492
LIAM: He's going to fail this one.

465
00:35:57,492 --> 00:36:01,152
MATT: With advantage, because you are raging.

466
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,462
TRAVIS: 27.

467
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:07,979
MATT: Oof! You yank the bloodaxe from his grip.

468
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,789
SAM: Yes!

469
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:14,331
TRAVIS: Because I'm frenzied raging, do I have
another move?

470
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:17,988
MATT: I mean--

471
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:19,745
TRAVIS: Like, can I hit him with it?

472
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:23,932
MATT: Let's check on that, because I don't know if
it's an attack-action-based, because you didn't

473
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,652
take an attack action last turn, you used your
action to pull it away.

474
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:33,248
Looking at that right now, the berserker is
here. Let me see.

475
00:36:33,248 --> 00:36:37,382
SAM: Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level
rules.

476
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:42,582
MATT: Yeah, it's a bonus action, so you could if
you wanted to. The weapon isn't attuned to you, so

477
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,301
it would just act as a regular axe, possibly.

478
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,859
ASHLEY: Make it attuned to you!

479
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,670
MARISHA: That's a short rest.

480
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:58,751
TRAVIS: Can I, looking at the axe, say, oh, I do
hope you have a necromancer in your group, because

481
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:00,696
I'm looking at a fucking dead man.

482
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,539
(laughter)

483
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:13,205
TRAVIS: Can I aim right above the gauntlet below
the elbow on his left arm? Swing to his side with

484
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:14,433
the axe.

485
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:21,104
MATT: Like on his left arm? Sure. You're going to
be-- it's going to-- okay, so you're raging.

486
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:25,186
Advantage. Well no, reckless attack would be the
advantage if you wanted to.

487
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:27,500
TRAVIS: Well, he did it against me so I get it
against him.

488
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,191
MATT: Well, you have advantage against attacks
with him anyway, because he's paralyzed. I will

489
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:40,663
say, it'll have-- okay, you'll have advantage on
the attack, but I will say it's a general minus

490
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:45,914
five to the attack, just because it's a very
specific called shot. Go for it.

491
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:47,835
MARISHA: Do it, do it.

492
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:53,919
TRAVIS: Oh, that's much better. 20.

493
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:56,411
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.

494
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:59,040
TRAVIS: I don't know what the attack bonus is with
the axe.

495
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,416
MATT: It's a d12, and add your strength modifier.

496
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:06,170
TRAVIS: Okay. Where is it? Jesus.

497
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,039
LAURA: That's it, that's it, that top one. That
one. Yeah.

498
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,415
MATT: Poor d12.

499
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,171
TRAVIS: This one? Plus what?

500
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:17,105
MATT: Strength modifier, which would be three.

501
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,706
TRAVIS: Ah. So five.

502
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:24,385
MATT: Five. Whoosh, you hack the blade and it
sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the

503
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:29,445
elbow, you can see as you pull it out, a bit of
bone is exposed from it, but the arm is still

504
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:33,995
intact. It wasn't enough damage to go through, but
he's like, (stifled yell)

505
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:37,758
TRAVIS: And it hit him, right? So is it an
automatic critical because it hit?

506
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:43,717
MATT: Because you were within five feet, so, yes.
So double the dice. So what'd you roll on the dice?

507
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:45,291
TRAVIS: So it was a two.

508
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,885
MATT: So four. So instead it would be seven
damage. Still not enough. But you do do a

509
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:56,824
significant amount of damage to his left arm. His
now-open hand's gripping nothing. Actually the one

510
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:59,970
hand was holding the axe and the other one was
pointing up, so he's like, (strained sound)

511
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:05,136
looking at you right now as the blood begins to
seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm.

512
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:10,925
TRAVIS: Do I have any of my movement left, can I
move around behind him? 50.

513
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:14,099
MATT: You can move three more spaces, so yeah.

514
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,216
TRAVIS: I'll either flank him or, yeah.

515
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:25,251
MATT: Three. That's where you can get, right
there. Okay. That ends your turn. Surprise back,

516
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:26,689
Percy, you're up.

517
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:35,621
TALIESIN: This'll be fun, we'll see what happens.
All right, first thing I'm going to do is cast Hex

518
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:39,921
on Kevdak, on the asshole, I'm going to Hex him.

519
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,857
MATT: (laughs) Cast Hex on the asshole.

520
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:49,701
TALIESIN: So he is now enveloped in my dark smoke
of death. He's also now at disadvantage on all

521
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:50,892
strength checks.

522
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,229
MATT: Okay.

523
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,444
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

524
00:39:53,444 --> 00:40:00,302
MATT: That's the thing with Hex, all right. So
yeah. You watch as Grog walks around him, Grog's

525
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:05,260
shadow seems to stretch out from his form, reach
up, and wrap itself around, almost merging with

526
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,538
the tattoos across his torso. The actual bear
tattoo almost seems to be almost

527
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,292
covered with shadow.

528
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:14,458
TRAVIS: I love you.

529
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:20,409
TALIESIN: I know, I'm so happy. I'm going to take
a little step back to get a slight bit of cover

530
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:24,826
from those archers for when they start hearing the
big bang-bangs coming from the house, to get

531
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,820
half-cover, so I can still--

532
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,181
MATT: Which way are you going?

533
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:32,372
TALIESIN: I'm going from my current vantage point,
to about seven o'clock, eight o'clock.

534
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:33,389
MATT: About here?

535
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:38,317
TALIESIN: Yeah, about there. For a little bit of
cover from the arrows. And I can still see Kevdak.

536
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:39,929
MATT: Yes, you can.

537
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:47,228
TALIESIN: So if I wanted to take my little pistol
and start carving a little-- and I've got a nice

538
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:53,605
little chunk of bone I can see in his arm-- can I
take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point?

539
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:57,918
MATT: You could. I'll move this board a little bit
so you guys can see better.

540
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:03,086
TALIESIN: So I'm going to shoot with sharpshooter
specifically for his arm.

541
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,395
MATT: His left arm, you do not have a view on it
right away.

542
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:08,454
TALIESIN: Oh.

543
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:10,564
MATT: I would say from your perspective on the
rooftop, because he was turned this way and is

544
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:14,204
facing this way, you would have a big ol' view of
his back and shoulders.

545
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,412
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take a shot for the
elbow.

546
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:17,686
MATT: On this arm?

547
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,405
TALIESIN: I'm going to try, yeah, on the visible
elbow.

548
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:20,541
MATT: Okay.

549
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,882
TALIESIN: I'm going to sharpshooter through that
shit, see what happens.

550
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,387
MATT: Go for it.

551
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:29,475
TALIESIN: Okay. And I'm happy if you want to put
any weird disadvantage--

552
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:31,456
MATT: You have advantage on the attack because
he's paralyzed.

553
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:36,494
TALIESIN: No, I don't, because I'm at distance. Or
do I have advantage be--

554
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,678
MARISHA: He's paralyzed.

555
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:39,441
TALIESIN: Oh, he's paralyzed! I have advantage on
the attack.

556
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,606
MATT: You have advantage on that, and then you
have disadvantage because it's a called shot, plus

557
00:41:42,606 --> 00:41:43,636
minus five.

558
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:45,572
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. But I get the bonus
ten points still.

559
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:46,728
MATT: You would if you hit.

560
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:50,923
TALIESIN: Okay. All right. That's fine. Natural
20.

561
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:52,923
ALL: Oh!

562
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:54,590
TRAVIS: Oh my god, are you serious?

563
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,859
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

564
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:02,178
TALIESIN: Should've used the big gun, really. All
right, that's okay. So that's, oh, hello baby,

565
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:04,093
you're over here. Actually, I'm going to use the
pink one--

566
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:05,716
MATT: What's the first range increment for the
pistol?

567
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,419
TALIESIN: 400 feet.

568
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,725
MATT: Yeah, okay.

569
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,910
TALIESIN: I'm scary.

570
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,295
MATT: Gun. Go for it.

571
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,633
TALIESIN: I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about
that. Come on, baby, no whammies.

572
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,994
Do I double the dice?

573
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,712
MATT: Double the dice and then add the modifier to
it.

574
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:26,552
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's 16, (counting), 32
points of damage for the first shot.

575
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:29,445
MATT: 32 points of damage? Okay, half of that into
16.

576
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:39,743
(gunshot) You watch as the blast hits into the
side of his arm. The arm actually hyperextends and

577
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:47,112
part of the bone shoots out the side, and he goes
and screams out. The arm does not, you know, it

578
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:48,752
looks like it's in a rough place.

579
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:50,553
TALIESIN: I'm shooting again. Same thing.

580
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,793
LAURA: Oh my god, he's going to shoot his arm
off.

581
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:57,898
TALIESIN: 17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good.

582
00:42:57,898 --> 00:43:00,068
MATT: With the disadvantage?

583
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:05,068
TALIESIN: No, it cancels out because he's-- it's
no advantage, no disadvantage, right?

584
00:43:05,068 --> 00:43:09,883
MATT: You got advantage because he's paralyzed,
yeah. You're right, you're right. Hold Person,

585
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:11,556
man. Nasty.

586
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,173
TALIESIN: (counting) 25 to hit. That hits.

587
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,198
SAM: This is like 127 Hours, except with a gun.

588
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:19,536
TALIESIN: That's the title of my, '127 Hours With
a Gun'.

589
00:43:19,536 --> 00:43:21,385
LIAM: And remember, this is happening in about ten
seconds.

590
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:26,795
TALIESIN: I know. I actually, also, I rolled the
wrong die, he didn't take nearly what, that's

591
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:28,022
okay, so here.

592
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,139
MATT: Too late.

593
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,345
TALIESIN: I know, too late. I know. I fucked that
up.

594
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,440
MARISHA: You rolled four, though.

595
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,897
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six,
seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage.

596
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:46,506
MATT: 24 points of damage. So minus that to 12,
this is the same elbow?

597
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:47,722
TALIESIN: Same elbow.

598
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:55,515
MATT: (gunshot) You see now, the arm actually is
dangling now from some sort of sinew and bone that

599
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:58,426
is barely keeping it on at this point.

600
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:02,764
TALIESIN: Do you have a d6 that I can borrow? I'm
going to go for my third, can I borrow your pink

601
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:09,134
d6? I want to Bowie this shit. Yeah. I want to be
flamboyant as fuck. All right. Going to call it.

602
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:15,457
14. (counting) 24 to hit.

603
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:16,765
MATT: That hits.

604
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:27,734
TALIESIN: Goodbye, elbow. Eh, well, not bad.
(counting) 23 points of damage.

605
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:39,539
MATT: Lower that to 11. Okay. This shot hits the
elbow again, actually destroying a big portion of

606
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:47,239
the upper forearm. It's now essentially but a
single leftover bicep muscle that's holding it in

607
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:50,867
place as blood's pouring from the wound right
now.

608
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,307
LIAM: Who wants bacon?

609
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:53,580
TALIESIN: All right. I'm calling it for now.

610
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,292
MATT: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

611
00:44:56,292 --> 00:45:06,696
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to roll up this roof like
a big, ominous fog cloud. And come up, and I want

612
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:09,408
to do a Whirlwind on those two archers up there.

613
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:10,964
MATT: Up here? Are you coming from up here, you
mean?

614
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:12,048
MARISHA: Yup.

615
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:16,878
MATT: All righty. Let's take this here.

616
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:19,883
MARISHA: So they must make a DC 13 strength saving
throw.

617
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,711
TALIESIN: I haven't burned any grit yet, I'm so
excited.

618
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:28,120
MATT: Balancing here, there we go. A DC what? Oh
no! Keyleth's dead.

619
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,145
LAURA and ASHLEY: No!

620
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:34,929
TALIESIN: Ironically, crushed by a tree. Curse
you, nature.

621
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:36,869
MATT: All right, what's the DC on that?

622
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:39,549
MARISHA: The thing that she loved killed her. 13.
Strength.

623
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:40,419
MATT: Strength?

624
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:42,341
TALIESIN: Strength check or save?

625
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:44,524
MATT: This is a saving throw.

626
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:46,416
TALIESIN: Oh, damn. Does he still have
disadvantage?

627
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:48,499
SAM: Except she's not attacking him.

628
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:51,042
MATT: Okay, one of them fails, one of them
succeeds.

629
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:58,108
MARISHA: Okay, so the one that fails takes 3d8
plus two bludgeoning damage, which is pretty good.

630
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:08,032
11, and he's flung 20 feet away. In a random
direction.

631
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:13,563
MATT: In a random direction? All right. Let's go
ahead and see what direction, that's a one, so he

632
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,558
gets flung this way 20 feet?

633
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:17,788
MARISHA: Yeah.

634
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:21,793
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20. (yells, impact). Falls
prone there.

635
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:27,574
MARISHA: He takes another 1d6 bludgeoning damage
for every ten feet he was thrown.

636
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:34,788
MATT: Yes, that would be-- 2d6, that puts it at, I
rolled double sixes on that, so that's 12 points

637
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:35,872
of damage.

638
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:36,972
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah!

639
00:46:36,972 --> 00:46:38,047
MARISHA: And he's knocked prone.

640
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,144
MATT: Yes he is.

641
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,424
MARISHA: And the other guy--

642
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,483
MATT: (yells, impact), as this whirlwind of--

643
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:45,613
LAURA and ASHLEY: Ow ow ow ow.

644
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:51,251
MATT: Yeah, as you see, of the roof itself up
there, portions of the rooftop are cracking off

645
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:56,048
and spinning into the void of wind that Keyleth's
currently creating within herself. Portions of the

646
00:46:56,048 --> 00:47:01,428
tree branches are swirling into it as various
leaves and dead plant life that had been scattered

647
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:04,930
around the roof are all filling this giant vortex
that has appeared on the roof of the Margrave's

648
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,440
house, tearing into both of the archers. One of
them flung off, landing face-first, the other one--

649
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,602
MARISHA: Takes half damage.

650
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:17,903
MATT: Takes half damage. Okay. All right. Five
points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Does that

651
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,021
finish your turn?

652
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:19,975
MARISHA: Yup.

653
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:21,247
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up.

654
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:22,665
SAM: Yeah, Pike!

655
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:29,930
ASHLEY: Since I can't reach Kevdak, I'm going to
send over a Spiritual Weapon.

656
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,089
MATT: Okay.

657
00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:34,794
ASHLEY: Range is 60 feet.

658
00:47:34,794 --> 00:47:43,900
MATT: Spiritual Weapon. As a cleric. That's a
level... two?

659
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,677
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at a higher level, I'm
going to do it at a level five.

660
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:50,400
TALIESIN: Five? Five?

661
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,741
ASHLEY: It's a big one.

662
00:47:52,741 --> 00:47:54,841
(laughter)

663
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:58,521
LIAM: In the shape of Madeline Kahn and it's out
for blood.

664
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:00,564
MATT: We'll use this metal d20, where do you want
to place it?

665
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:04,227
ASHLEY: Right above him.

666
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:07,175
MATT: We'll say in this central area there.

667
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,702
ASHLEY: It's, I don't even know, a big--

668
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:17,498
MATT: What weapon of Sarenrae's retribution would
you want to summon in spiritual form upon Kevdak?

669
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:18,673
SAM: A beartrap!

670
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:21,003
ASHLEY: I just want it to be a big sword.

671
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:28,853
MATT: Okay, so a large greathand sword, almost a
light reflection mirror-image of the Craven Edge

672
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:30,500
that nearly tore the soul from your friend--

673
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,647
TRAVIS: Yes!

674
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:37,738
MATT: You see a large light blade of Sarenrae's
wrath emerges out of the stonework in the center

675
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:43,996
of the square. Floats in the air for a second, and
you want to go ahead and make that, and this is

676
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,233
your bonus action--

677
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:47,249
ASHLEY: This is a bonus action, yeah.

678
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:50,471
MATT: If you want to use your action to cast a
spell, you can't do higher than a level two right

679
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:56,721
now. Because of the limitations on spells in our
homebrew. However, do you want to have it attack

680
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:57,841
Kevdak?

681
00:48:57,841 --> 00:48:58,735
ASHLEY: Yeah!

682
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,050
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for the damage.
With advantage.

683
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,930
ASHLEY: That would be a natural 20.

684
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,966
LAURA: C'mon, Pike!

685
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,649
ASHLEY: All right, okay.

686
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,991
MARISHA: We talked for a week!

687
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:16,696
TALIESIN: Hundreds of text messages.

688
00:49:16,696 --> 00:49:20,393
MATT: Wait 'til the surprise round's over.

689
00:49:20,393 --> 00:49:23,367
LIAM: You mean 30 seconds with the earring.

690
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:26,922
MATT: All right, so, you're looking at 4d8.

691
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:31,026
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use Divine Strike
to make it 5d8.

692
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:35,074
MATT: Well, that's only on your melee attack, it's
not your actual spells.

693
00:49:35,074 --> 00:49:36,751
LIAM: It's all right, you're already a badass.

694
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:40,448
MATT: So roll 4d8, multiply that by two.

695
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:42,471
SAM: Multiply by two.

696
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:43,701
MATT: Critical hit.

697
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:45,708
SAM: Oh my god.

698
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,469
ASHLEY: What did you say?

699
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:50,587
MATT: You roll 4d8 times two.

700
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,068
ASHLEY: 22.

701
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:53,987
MATT: So 22 plus your wisdom modifier.

702
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:56,248
ASHLEY: Is 30.

703
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,827
MATT: So 30. Half that to 15.

704
00:49:58,827 --> 00:49:59,966
ASHLEY: Aw.

705
00:49:59,966 --> 00:50:01,529
SAM: Hey, that's good!

706
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:07,459
MATT: As the blade strikes down onto the now
currently brutalized Kevdak who is still held in

707
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:14,021
place angrily being whaled upon by the majority of
you. So what else do you want to do

708
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:15,482
this turn, if anything?

709
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,042
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can still do other things!

710
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,381
MATT: You can move, you have an action.

711
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:19,516
LAURA: This is a bonus!

712
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,796
MATT: It lasts for a minute, and it's not
concentration.

713
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:23,677
ASHLEY: Yeah, I should probably, I should
probably--

714
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:26,003
MATT: As a bonus action you can make it move and
attack every round, so.

715
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:34,185
ASHLEY: Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to, would it
be possible to get down on that bottom roof and hide?

716
00:50:34,185 --> 00:50:35,198
MATT: Here?

717
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,106
ASHLEY: Yeah.

718
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:37,608
MATT: You could. Make an acrobatics check.

719
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:39,199
TALIESIN: Clang clang clang.

720
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:48,087
LAURA: You're going to roll, roll for it! I can't
even read that. Oh.

721
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,858
MATT: What's the total?

722
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:54,154
ASHLEY: Five.

723
00:50:54,154 --> 00:51:02,799
MATT: Fresh off the 20. Pike looks over the edge,
leaps, hits a little bit to the side, her feet

724
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:08,055
actually break-- from the weight of the armor and
the angle you hit, break some of the shingles on

725
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:12,760
the rooftop and you end up slipping onto your
shield and you slide off the roof.

726
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,990
LAURA: No!

727
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,622
MATT: And end up on the ground there.

728
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:22,864
MATT: You take seven points of damage from the
fall, and you're knocked prone currently on the

729
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:29,149
ground as you now see staring at you-- You're
prone. A number of these angry Herd members that

730
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:32,952
are all intent on murder at what's been
happening.

731
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:34,989
LIAM: I still think you're really cool.

732
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:37,523
ASHLEY: It's okay, I can run out of there with my
Sprinter's Boots.

733
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:43,898
MATT: All right, Pike, that ends your turn. Now. I
get to do some more stuff.

734
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:45,804
TALIESIN: She's made of armor.

735
00:51:45,804 --> 00:51:50,579
SAM: They're coming for you, Pike. You got a
reaction or something?

736
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,870
LAURA: Seriously. Pike, they're all coming for
you.

737
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,741
SAM: Yeah. You're dead. Do you have a reaction of
some sort? Do you have a reaction?

738
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,885
MARISHA: Don't die, you are not dying tonight.

739
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:02,368
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're
going to be fine, we're going to be fine.

740
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:06,599
TALIESIN: She's made of armor and they're people
with sticks, with sharp sticks.

741
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,233
SAM: Oh my god, she's going to die.

742
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,068
MARISHA: She's not going to die, she's not going
to die.

743
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:11,239
SAM: Love of my life.

744
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:12,534
TALIESIN: Not in one round.

745
00:52:12,534 --> 00:52:14,149
MARISHA: There's only one guy who ran up to her.

746
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:17,301
LAURA: Scanlan, would it say 'reaction' here?

747
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,318
SAM: She knows what her reactions are. You do have
one.

748
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,787
MATT: All right, so. Three of these individuals,
some of which you may have passed in your time,

749
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:30,888
and two of which you see are members that were
absorbed into the tribe from what was previously

750
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:37,619
the Rivermaw tribe, (roar) give off these angry
roars and go into an immediate rage, breaking the

751
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,877
surprise element, and charge. Three of them on
you, one of them goes darting across the field

752
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:49,720
right towards you, Pike. With that, these, pull
out this sheet here, these Herd of the Storm

753
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:57,885
warmongers are going to go apeshit on your ass.
Grog, that's six attacks on you. Because of the

754
00:52:57,885 --> 00:53:01,265
flanking rules, that's going to put four of them
at advantage.

755
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:05,133
SAM: Oh my god.

756
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:09,869
MATT: First one is going to be an 18 to hit?

757
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:11,164
TRAVIS: Misses.

758
00:53:11,164 --> 00:53:14,562
MATT: Misses. The first one goes and swings
towards you, and you duck underneath it and

759
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:17,961
whoomph, misses you by a mile. However, as that's
happening, another blade comes the other

760
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,278
direction, that's going to be a 25?

761
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:22,691
TRAVIS: That hits.

762
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:33,521
MATT: Natural 20. Third one, so one hit. Second
one's going to be a 28, so that's two hits and a

763
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:38,279
critical. And then one that doesn't have advantage
on you with both strikes is going to be 23, that

764
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:41,028
hits, and a 16 that misses. So.

765
00:53:41,028 --> 00:53:42,643
SAM: You do have inspiration.

766
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:43,851
MATT: Four hits and one crit.

767
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,825
TRAVIS: I can't use it on this stuff, though. Only
when I attack.

768
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:55,512
MATT: All righty. So, the four hits first. That's
going to be 15 points of slashing damage.

769
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:57,285
TRAVIS: Reduced to seven?

770
00:53:57,285 --> 00:54:04,697
MATT: Reduced to seven. Right. Ooh, 19 points of
slashing damage, reduced to eight.

771
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:06,006
TRAVIS: Okay.

772
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:15,405
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage, reduced to
six. And another 13, reduced to six. Now for the crit.

773
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:20,608
TALIESIN: I would like to remind you that potions
are a bonus action. Thank you.

774
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:24,852
MATT: (counting) That's going to be 22 points of
slashing damage on that, reduced to 11.

775
00:54:24,852 --> 00:54:27,300
TALIESIN: Whew, you are a tank.

776
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,898
LAURA: Unless he's unconscious.

777
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:34,859
MATT: Pike. So you're now surrounded on all sides,
Kevdak's there before you, but you've now been

778
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:39,563
completely swarmed in by three of these entities.
Pike, this one rushes towards you, (battle-cry),

779
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:43,929
this female half-elf, you can see a line of drool
from her face with the sheer speed she was running

780
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:48,328
and the froth that was forming at the corner of
it. She leaps into the air, blade in front, and is

781
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:55,751
going to come down on your tiny form. (counting)
That's 28 to hit on the first one.

782
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,024
ASHLEY: Yeah.

783
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,431
MATT: And a 28. Rolled 18s on both advantage
ones.

784
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,930
ASHLEY: Okay okay okay okay.

785
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:09,047
MATT: Right, so two hits on you, you take 19
points of slashing damage from the first strike.

786
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,469
ASHLEY: That's not halved? No, it's only halved
because he's--

787
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:12,788
MATT: Only because he's raging.

788
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:14,183
ASHLEY: I'm a barbarian, too!

789
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:15,966
(laughter)

790
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:26,154
MATT: 19 on the first strike, the second one is
13, so that's a total of 32 points of slashing

791
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:30,952
damage to you. And that's going to end the
barbarians' turn, everyone else finishes out

792
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:35,024
surprise round, now we're back into full
initiative, everyone's in play, top of the round,

793
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:36,149
Vex, you're up.

794
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:48,297
LAURA: Okay. If I aim an arrow, it's at
disadvantage?

795
00:55:48,297 --> 00:55:53,211
MATT: If you aimed specifically for something? It
would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit.

796
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:59,249
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast, I'm going to
cast--

797
00:55:59,249 --> 00:56:03,945
MATT: I mean, he's paralyzed, so it would have
advantage, so it would cancel out, it would be

798
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,515
just a regular attack at minus five.

799
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:06,591
LAURA: Okay, here's my question.

800
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:07,554
MATT: Yes?

801
00:56:07,554 --> 00:56:13,668
LAURA: The siege arrow that Percy gave me, is that
a magical weapon or a technical weapon?

802
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:19,468
MATT: It's a technical weapon, it's used
essentially against structures, objects.

803
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:20,662
LAURA: So just structures.

804
00:56:20,662 --> 00:56:24,691
MATT: It's an explosive in an arrow that is used
primarily to destroy structures, yeah.

805
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:25,989
LAURA: So it wouldn't harm people?

806
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:28,619
MATT: I mean, it would hurt people like a regular
arrow, and it might do a little bit extra, but--

807
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,109
LAURA: Not anything crazy?

808
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:34,599
MATT: Not that you know of, you don't have a full
understanding of what the arrow's capable of. You

809
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,844
did not create it.

810
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:38,015
TALIESIN: I gave you the big debrief with the
arrow, I gave you the how-to--

811
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:39,610
LAURA: I know I know I know I know.

812
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,824
MATT: What're you doing? Hurry.

813
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:42,534
LAURA: Okay okay okay! Okay!

814
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,659
MATT: Vax, you're on deck.

815
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:51,176
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third
level into a group, the group. At Kevdak.

816
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:53,779
TRAVIS: No. Whatever you're going to do. Just do
it.

817
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:58,159
LAURA: Just do it? I'm going to do it at Kevdak
and anything that is close to him gets hit.

818
00:56:58,159 --> 00:56:59,726
Anything--

819
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:03,514
MATT: Within five feet of him? And you're doing it
at what level?

820
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:04,859
LAURA: At level three.

821
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:11,756
MATT: Level three, so that's 3d10 points of piercing
damage. All righty. Okay. So go ahead and make an

822
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:18,345
attack against Kevdak, that is going to be-- Yeah,
with advantage because it's not an aimed shot, so

823
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:20,077
go ahead and take it.

824
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:22,180
LAURA: Natural 20.

825
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,301
MATT: Are you serious?

826
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:27,751
TALIESIN: You've been doing it all night, too. I
figure, you know, it's only fair.

827
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:30,179
MATT: I've gotten like one.

828
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,701
TALIESIN: No, you've had more than one. We've been
counting.

829
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:33,723
MATT: I've had two?

830
00:57:33,723 --> 00:57:36,345
LIAM: Two for Kevdak's initiative and two for
here.

831
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:39,733
MATT: That's true, that's true, I actually,
could've been worse. All right, so. Go ahead and

832
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:44,941
roll against Kevdak, that is going to be six, or
3d10 times two.

833
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:47,168
LAURA: Oh, 3d10? Oh.

834
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:50,255
SAM: Yeah, oh.

835
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:59,903
LAURA: 20, plus an additional-- oh no, Hunter's
Mark dropped because it's a concentration. But I

836
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:07,697
am sneaking-attacking. An additional six. Oh,
that's 12 then, because it doubles the dice.

837
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:08,916
MATT: Correct, yeah.

838
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,393
LAURA: So that's 32 points of damage.

839
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:16,602
MATT: 32 on him, reduce that to 16 piercing. All
righty. And then all the rest of them have to make

840
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:20,047
dexterity saving throws against your spell DC.
What's your spell DC? This includes Grog.

841
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:21,256
LAURA: 15.

842
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:22,563
SAM: C'mon, Groggy.

843
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:23,733
TRAVIS: What, what was it?

844
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,696
LAURA: 15.

845
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:25,957
TRAVIS: What 15?

846
00:58:25,957 --> 00:58:27,898
SAM: You got to make a save to get outta the way.

847
00:58:27,898 --> 00:58:30,188
With inspiration.

848
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:33,592
LAURA: With inspiration.

849
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:41,367
TRAVIS: 17.

850
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:44,235
MATT: All right, so half damage to you, Grog.

851
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,300
TRAVIS: Okay.

852
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,581
MATT: Which is halved again, one quarter, because
there's a whole bunch of raging individuals.

853
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:53,262
TRAVIS: 32, halved is 16, which is eight.

854
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:55,963
MATT: Two of them succeed as well and also take
eight damage.

855
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:59,388
LAURA: They're barbarians as well?

856
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:01,394
SAM: They're raging? They're raging.

857
00:59:01,394 --> 00:59:10,199
MATT: And then one of them takes full damage at
16. All righty. So. That concludes your action.

858
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:12,199
You want to move, or you going to stay where you
are?

859
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:19,610
LAURA: If I fly on my broom, can I go down and
grab Pike? As an action? I mean, as a movement?

860
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:25,068
MATT: It's going to be hard-pressed for you this
turn to pull out your broom. I mean, you've been

861
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:28,186
clutching your broom with you this whole time, you
leaned it up against the wall as you hid down there?

862
00:59:28,186 --> 00:59:34,709
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm
going to hide against the window so nobody can see me.

863
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:36,624
MATT: Okay.

864
00:59:36,624 --> 00:59:38,328
LAURA: Against on-- yeah, like that.

865
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:46,127
MATT: That brings us to the next in the initiative
order, Vax.

866
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:50,654
LIAM: All right, I want to preface this with, last
week I misspoke, I thought I had one Luck left as

867
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:55,276
I used it, but I got it backwards, so I have one
Luck left this week in case I want to use it.

868
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:56,308
MATT: Okay.

869
00:59:56,308 --> 00:59:57,849
SAM: Go back and look at the videotape.

870
00:59:57,849 --> 01:00:03,143
LIAM: You can. Well no, I said the wrong thing.
But anyway, I want to use my first action to shove

871
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:05,009
that archer backward off the roof.

872
01:00:05,009 --> 01:00:06,365
MATT: Shove them?

873
01:00:06,365 --> 01:00:07,680
LIAM: Yeah, shove them off.

874
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:16,117
MATT: All right, let's go ahead and do a shove
action. Find myself on this one here-- all right,

875
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:20,621
so, for shove-- I need you to go ahead and--

876
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,175
LIAM: Strength?

877
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:23,742
MATT: --make an athletics check.

878
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:24,879
LIAM: Athletics check.

879
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:25,986
MATT: Yes.

880
01:00:25,986 --> 01:00:28,464
LIAM: I'm going to trigger the Luck right now.

881
01:00:28,464 --> 01:00:29,511
MATT: All right.

882
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:32,079
LIAM: That helped it, yeah. That gets it to 20.

883
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,912
MATT: To 20? That's going to be a 12.

884
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:38,536
LAURA and MARISHA: Yay!

885
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:45,140
MATT: So you shove it five feet. This way? All
right, so it's going to go ahead and make an

886
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,073
acrobatics--

887
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:47,656
LIAM: Ah, no, towards you, Matt, was my intention,
yeah.

888
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:52,352
MATT: Towards me? All right, this way. Shove, they
do make an acrobatics check but they do land off

889
01:00:52,352 --> 01:01:00,813
the side here. So they take eight points of damage
being pushed off the side. All righty.

890
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:02,904
SAM: This board is incredible.

891
01:01:02,904 --> 01:01:07,721
MATT: So that person's now fallen out of sight
(yells), off the side.

892
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:11,975
LIAM: Now, question: am I able to use my bonus
action to hide behind that chimney from Kevdak's

893
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:16,314
view, and the archers are, am I able to do that?
Just with Kevdak?

894
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:19,368
MATT: Yeah, the chimney should offer you enough,
and you have a tree between the two of you

895
01:01:19,368 --> 01:01:20,288
anyway.

896
01:01:20,288 --> 01:01:22,395
LIAM: Okay. So I hide behind the chimney.

897
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:24,134
MATT: Make a dexterity, make a stealth check.

898
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:27,537
LIAM: Stealth check. That's 25.

899
01:01:27,537 --> 01:01:28,531
MATT: Okay.

900
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:32,414
LIAM: And I would like to use my last action to
throw at Kevdak, so I should still have advantage,

901
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:38,493
because he's held, and I should have, if I'm
hiding, it's a sneak attack, isn't it?

902
01:01:38,493 --> 01:01:41,636
MATT: Well, sneak attack is if it's an attack with
advantage anyway.

903
01:01:41,636 --> 01:01:44,981
LIAM: Oh, my friend's still next to him. Oh, then,
then, excuse me, I would like to throw two

904
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,137
daggers.

905
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:47,686
MATT: Well, the shove was your action.

906
01:01:47,686 --> 01:01:50,730
LIAM: Right, and I did the boots, so I have
action-action-bonus action.

907
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,864
MATT: Okay, hold on. Let me see if it's-- You
don't have two actions, you have two attacks. Let

908
01:01:54,864 --> 01:02:02,091
me check and see if it is. There is a distinction
there.

909
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:05,178
LIAM: Every millimeter counts tonight.

910
01:02:05,178 --> 01:02:09,045
MATT: Yeah, this attack replaces one of them, if
you have multiple attacks, with the attack action,

911
01:02:09,045 --> 01:02:13,594
which you don't. So you have your offhand bonus
and the haste one, so you do have--

912
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:24,306
LIAM: Two attacks right now. Okay. So first one is
an 18 to hit Kevdak, second one is a 25 to hit

913
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:25,256
Kevdak.

914
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:26,376
MATT: Both hit.

915
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:33,047
LIAM: Both hit. Okay. So the first one,
(counting).

916
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:35,457
MARISHA: That rogue damage. That rogue damage!

917
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:46,672
LIAM: I'm missing a big pile of dice! Eight, 12,
13, 19, 22, 28, 30, 36.

918
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:54,082
MATT: 36, half that to-- I know, that brings it to
36, 18.

919
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:56,066
LIAM: Is it? It's not a crit, right?

920
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:57,669
MATT: No, but it's half-damage for him.

921
01:02:57,669 --> 01:03:02,894
LIAM: Right, I have to be right up against him to
get a crit, and the second dagger does eight

922
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:04,107
halved to four.

923
01:03:04,107 --> 01:03:08,337
MATT: Okay, four damage, gotcha. Total 22 points
of damage on him. As he's taking all these hits.

924
01:03:08,337 --> 01:03:09,678
All right.

925
01:03:09,678 --> 01:03:11,097
LIAM: And I have a little bit of movement, right?

926
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:12,995
MATT: You do have a little bit of movement,
because you--

927
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:18,383
LIAM: I'll go fwoosh, right up against the flat
side, right below Keyleth, pressed against the

928
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:19,361
wall there.

929
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:20,287
MATT: All right.

930
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:21,651
LAURA: Looking up her windskirts?

931
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,459
LIAM: No. Not that.

932
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:27,072
MARISHA: I've got a Marilyn Monroe thing going on
in my air elemental, oh.

933
01:03:27,072 --> 01:03:29,538
MATT: There we go. So you're now hidden up against
that roof right below there, and your stealth

934
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,179
check was 25 earlier, so we'll go with that.

935
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:34,292
LIAM: All right, maybe, maybe a quick look. Maybe
a quick look.

936
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:41,634
MATT: Move the board a little bit for the people
that are watching so they can get a better view

937
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:49,642
here. There we go. So you're over here. Right
here, Liam. All right. So! That brings us to--

938
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:52,635
LIAM: Oh, shit! Never mind.

939
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:53,700
SAM: Six more attacks!

940
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,048
MATT: No, you're done, your turn's over.

941
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,720
LIAM: Never mind, I didn't say it, I didn't say it
so it doesn't matter.

942
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:08,836
MATT: Yeah. All right, so. This archer here is
going to turn, looking over at the-- let's see.

943
01:04:08,836 --> 01:04:16,848
He's currently handled, he's okay right there.
This archer saw you firing. Over in that hide,

944
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:17,990
he's going to turn to you.

945
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:21,950
TALIESIN: I'm looking at him right now, actually,
I've got my gun in my left hand and I'm looking at him.

946
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,756
MATT: Archer's going to take two shots, pulling on
his longbow, (arrow sounds).

947
01:04:24,756 --> 01:04:26,532
Two arrows at you, Percy.

948
01:04:26,532 --> 01:04:28,542
TALIESIN: I smile the whole time. Bring it.

949
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:31,506
LIAM: Staring at him with that dead-in-the-eyes
Percy look? Yeah.

950
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:33,741
TALIESIN: Do not fuck with Reed Richards. He will
fuck you up.

951
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:36,843
MATT: That is a 20 to hit on the first one.

952
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:38,474
TALIESIN: That hits.

953
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,968
MATT: And a 25 on the second.

954
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:41,930
TALIESIN: That, that also hits.

955
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,939
SAM: Everybody's rolling high tonight. Except us.

956
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:52,890
MATT: First one is 11 points of piercing damage to
you.

957
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,325
TALIESIN: 11 for the first one?

958
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:56,174
MATT: Yep.

959
01:04:56,174 --> 01:04:57,383
TALIESIN: I take it in the shoulder.

960
01:04:57,383 --> 01:05:02,265
MATT: All right. The second one is going to go
ahead and do 13 points of piercing damage.

961
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:03,671
TALIESIN: That one I'm going to catch.

962
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:06,115
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for it.

963
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:08,868
SAM: Gloves of Missile Snaring!

964
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:15,206
TALIESIN: That's 14, so not only does it do no
damage, I actually take it and catch.

965
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,206
MATT: You catch the arrow in front of your face.

966
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,359
TALIESIN: Snap it.

967
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,232
MATT: (laughs) That's amazing.

968
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:23,558
TALIESIN: And the gun is going to turn to look at
him.

969
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:24,486
MATT: Okay.

970
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:25,362
TALIESIN: Thank you.

971
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:26,582
LAURA: Nice, Percy.

972
01:05:26,582 --> 01:05:31,641
MATT: You can see from the distance the visage of
this half-orc looks back as you do that and goes--

973
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:44,248
And goes to shakily-- hand reaching back for
another arrow. This archer's going to go ahead and

974
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:48,871
leap down onto here. Oh, you do get an attack of
opportunity on him.

975
01:05:48,871 --> 01:05:51,236
LAURA: He knocks down a tree in the process.

976
01:05:51,236 --> 01:05:55,958
MARISHA: What a dick! That's a natural 18, so
that's a 26.

977
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:59,678
MATT: Pretty sure that hits. Also rolled a natural
19 on the acrobatics check, so lands fine, but you

978
01:05:59,678 --> 01:06:02,561
do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him
as he jumps down.

979
01:06:02,561 --> 01:06:07,386
LIAM: Airsoft shot to the nuts.

980
01:06:07,386 --> 01:06:08,812
MARISHA: I rolled double ones.

981
01:06:08,812 --> 01:06:10,518
LAURA: Pathetic!

982
01:06:10,518 --> 01:06:12,156
MARISHA: Plus five, so seven.

983
01:06:12,156 --> 01:06:14,215
LAURA: That's not bad, that's not bad.

984
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:15,578
MARISHA: Little damage.

985
01:06:15,578 --> 01:06:17,601
LIAM: Something to remember you by.

986
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,072
ASHLEY: Maybe he only has like ten hit points.

987
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:24,036
MATT: Cool, so your elemental form swings wide,
manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap

988
01:06:24,036 --> 01:06:27,852
down, sending them into a spin, but they do manage
to catch themself because they're quite acrobatic.

989
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:33,115
In doing so, they step up to the very edge here to
their friend, who is currently on the ground, who

990
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:38,202
is also going to get up there, and they're both
going to look at each other, pull their arrows

991
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:46,168
out, and they're going to go ahead and make a
series of strikes. Let's see. This one here is

992
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:51,053
going to go ahead and is going to shoot at Pike,
because Pike's on the ground. And this one's going

993
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:57,263
to go ahead and strike at Grog, because it can't
see Percy over there through the tree. So Grog--

994
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:04,083
LAURA: Natural one, natural one.

995
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,961
MATT: That is a 19.

996
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:07,326
TRAVIS: Misses.

997
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:12,176
MATT: Misses you? (arrow sound) One arrow hits the
bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters

998
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:15,719
off the bone. The second one, however, is a 26.

999
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:16,900
TRAVIS: Yes, that hits.

1000
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:23,264
MATT: All right, so. From that one, you take, I
don't like that, cocked. Nine points of piercing

1001
01:07:23,264 --> 01:07:29,765
damage. Reduced to four. The one that's taking two
strikes at you, Pike, because you're on the

1002
01:07:29,765 --> 01:07:30,810
ground, now.

1003
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,768
ASHLEY: It's also probably very hard for him to
shoot through the people that are attacking me.

1004
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:37,618
MATT: There is one individual attacking you that
is on the other side of your body, so you're

1005
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:39,179
pretty visible from that point in time.

1006
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:40,916
ASHLEY: Okay.

1007
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:43,665
LAURA: She's really little.

1008
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:50,946
MATT: However, the attack, because you are prone,
it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you

1009
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:56,819
because it's not within five feet of you. But it's
going to go ahead and attempt to make it. Two 17s

1010
01:07:56,819 --> 01:08:02,713
in a row. Plus ten, that's-- sorry, not plus ten,
plus eight on the archers, yeah, plus eight. So

1011
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:03,993
that's 25?

1012
01:08:03,993 --> 01:08:04,894
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1013
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:11,812
MATT: And natural one on the other disadvantage,
so that misses. You take 13 points of piercing

1014
01:08:11,812 --> 01:08:16,616
damage from one of the arrows, (arrow sound). So
it's going to do there. They finish their turns.

1015
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:23,313
This one is going to, being pushed, shoved off,
come around here.

1016
01:08:23,313 --> 01:08:26,517
MARISHA: What? Who's that?

1017
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:28,235
LAURA: Oh, that's the one you pushed off the
roof.

1018
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:35,531
MATT: Is going to come over this way and hide to
the side. Just going to watch what's happening.

1019
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:41,861
That finishes the archers' turn. Kevdak. (grunts)
Unable to do anything, is going to attempt to make

1020
01:08:41,861 --> 01:08:48,739
a saving throw. And that is going to be a total of
18. What's your DC?

1021
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:49,853
SAM: 20.

1022
01:08:49,853 --> 01:08:51,400
(yelling)

1023
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:57,555
TRAVIS: Oh, Scanlan! I will make out with that
fucking shirt, I swear to god!

1024
01:08:57,555 --> 01:09:08,206
SAM: I mean, my spell DC's 18, but with the Hand
Cone of Clarity, okay.

1025
01:09:08,206 --> 01:09:11,526
TALIESIN: Don't talk him out of it.

1026
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:12,790
SAM: Just making sure.

1027
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:18,738
MATT: Oh man. All right, well, that ends Kevdak's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1028
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:27,647
SAM: Okay. I, while maintaining concentration I
can still use the wand to do things, yeah? So I'll

1029
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:30,715
use three charges of the Wand of Fireballs.

1030
01:09:30,715 --> 01:09:32,162
MATT: What're you doing now?

1031
01:09:32,162 --> 01:09:36,328
SAM: I'm aiming a Fireball right around there.

1032
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:37,867
MATT: So moving up to here.

1033
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:44,083
SAM: Oh yes, I guess I have to move forward to
attack. Can I get a radius that includes Kevdak

1034
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,478
and these guys over here?

1035
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:46,898
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1036
01:09:46,898 --> 01:09:50,938
SAM: But not Pike. And hopefully not Grog if my
aim is true.

1037
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:54,185
MATT: Yeah, if you get it there you can manage to
hit all of them but Grog right there.

1038
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:55,157
SAM: Okay.

1039
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,412
ASHLEY: Go Scanlan!

1040
01:09:56,412 --> 01:09:58,626
MATT: One, two, three, four, five, six.

1041
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:01,375
SAM: Okay. Three charges is 10d6.

1042
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:06,128
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll that. Kevdak
automatically fails, because he's paralyzed.

1043
01:10:06,128 --> 01:10:10,840
LIAM: Yeah. MVP.

1044
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,668
MATT: So does Greenbeard.

1045
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:16,827
SAM: 34.

1046
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:26,421
MATT: All right, so. 34, reduced to half because
he's raging. That brings it to six, no, 17. All

1047
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:38,831
right, and then Greenbeard takes 34. The other
ones there, they do not get advantages because

1048
01:10:38,831 --> 01:10:46,399
they're all just fighters, that's a failure,
failure, what was the spell DC on the wand?

1049
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:48,467
Because it's different from yours.

1050
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:51,972
SAM: DC's 15, I wrote it down. DC 15.

1051
01:10:51,972 --> 01:11:03,282
MATT: Okay, so that's a success. Success. So two
of them over there take-- all right.

1052
01:11:03,282 --> 01:11:08,479
TALIESIN: It'll be fine, it'll be fine, things are
working.

1053
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:15,172
MATT: All righty. Great, so (explosion). Giant
burst of flame hits, it actually sets fire to this

1054
01:11:15,172 --> 01:11:20,556
entire structure. The wooden barricade is in
flames, we'll say for the purposes of considering that.

1055
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:22,606
SAM: There's flaming spikes on the field!

1056
01:11:22,606 --> 01:11:25,213
MARISHA: Flaming spikes!

1057
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:31,477
MATT: All right, so. There we go. There is
currently--

1058
01:11:31,477 --> 01:11:35,168
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you were going to
come up with a-- oh wow, that's actually-- never

1059
01:11:35,168 --> 01:11:37,177
mind, I am not disappointed at all.

1060
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:39,364
MATT: So those are on fire.

1061
01:11:39,364 --> 01:11:44,065
MARISHA: Hah, 'I thought you were going to come
out with a f-- that, that, yeah, that works, that.'

1062
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:46,132
MATT: All right. So.

1063
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:50,296
SAM: I'm going to try to do the Pike move and jump
down one level.

1064
01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:52,186
MATT: Down there? All right, make an acrobatics
check.

1065
01:11:52,186 --> 01:11:56,390
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. 14-- 19!

1066
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:00,646
MATT: 19. You leap down and make it right there.

1067
01:12:00,646 --> 01:12:07,838
SAM: Okay. And I will, with the bonus, I will heal
Grog with a Healing Word.

1068
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,204
MATT: Healing Word, okay.

1069
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:16,138
What's the range on it?

1070
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:20,194
SAM: Oh. 60 feet for Healing Word, I believe.
Right?

1071
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:22,114
MATT: He's just out of your range.

1072
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:24,557
SAM: Okay, well then I will heal Pike, is that
okay?

1073
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,535
MATT: You can do that, you can shout over the
side. You have to get into view of her, which

1074
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:28,276
means you have to move a little bit closer to the
edge, but yeah.

1075
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:29,676
SAM: Okay, I'll do that.

1076
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:34,510
MATT: Okay, so you get about there, glance off the
side. All right. Go for it.

1077
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:41,876
SAM: I'll peek over the side and say, (singing)
Never going to fuck you up, never going to let you

1078
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:46,803
down, never going to run around and not heal you.

1079
01:12:46,803 --> 01:12:48,415
(laughter)

1080
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:53,894
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll your heal
for Pike. Grog, you're up next.

1081
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:55,453
SAM: Yeah, seven points!

1082
01:12:55,453 --> 01:12:56,956
ASHLEY: Oh, I'll take it.

1083
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,957
MATT: Hey, it all helps. All right. And with that,
Grog, you're up.

1084
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:04,126
LAURA: Oh my god. (singing) Natural crit.

1085
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:12,941
TRAVIS: So in my frenzied reckless attacking,
great weapon master, can I bring my axe up high

1086
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:17,336
and swing it for the first attack to his left side
where dangly hand is?

1087
01:13:17,336 --> 01:13:23,319
MATT: You can, go for it. Your regular straight
attack. You have advantage, and then it's

1088
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:26,784
disadvantage for that, so that brings it to a
regular attack. Minus five.

1089
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:28,103
TRAVIS: Disadvantage for the?

1090
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,582
MATT: Because of the called shot.

1091
01:13:29,582 --> 01:13:30,623
TRAVIS: Okay.

1092
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,515
MARISHA: But then advantage because it's
reckless?

1093
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:39,377
TRAVIS: 23.

1094
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,753
MATT: 23? Hits. With the minus five?

1095
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,109
TRAVIS: No. 18.

1096
01:13:45,109 --> 01:13:46,261
MATT: Still hits.

1097
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:47,809
(cheering)

1098
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:49,227
TALIESIN: You asshole.

1099
01:13:49,227 --> 01:13:52,527
MATT: So it's a d12.

1100
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:58,434
TRAVIS: (counting) 20 for the first one. 30, with
great weapon master.

1101
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:02,110
LAURA: But you double your dice because it's a
natural crit, because he's five feet away.

1102
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,704
MATT: Because he's paralyzed and five feet away.

1103
01:14:03,704 --> 01:14:05,204
TRAVIS: 60.

1104
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:06,793
LAURA: No, just your dice, double your dice.

1105
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:11,692
MATT: This is with your axe, right? So with the axe,
it's a d12 plus your raging bonus,

1106
01:14:11,692 --> 01:14:13,036
plus your strength.

1107
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,109
TRAVIS: 11. Which is seven. Or eight. Rage bonus
is eight.

1108
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:18,760
MATT: Well, the rage bonus should be plus-- the
total becomes plus--

1109
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,166
TRAVIS: Oh sorry, the total bonus is eight.

1110
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:24,618
MATT: Three plus-- four, isn't it, right now? So
it should be seven.

1111
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:28,270
TRAVIS: That's why that's a seven. That's it.
Right.

1112
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,540
MATT: Yeah. You're not using your warhammer.
You're not attuned to this weapon.

1113
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,205
TRAVIS: Right, okay, so whatever.

1114
01:14:32,205 --> 01:14:33,252
MATT: So what'd you roll on the dice?

1115
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:34,298
TRAVIS: 11.

1116
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:39,804
MATT: 11. Technically it's a critical hit. So, I
mean, it's a critical hit, so you do your brutal

1117
01:14:39,804 --> 01:14:48,936
critical. You roll two more d12s. So it was an 11
times two, that's 22, plus seven, that's 29,

1118
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:50,109
plus 2d12.

1119
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:53,887
TRAVIS: Five, so that's 34.

1120
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:55,139
MATT: 34.

1121
01:14:55,139 --> 01:14:59,256
TRAVIS: And a nine, so that's 43.

1122
01:14:59,256 --> 01:15:02,023
MATT: 43 reduced to half, that's 21 points of
slashing damage.

1123
01:15:02,023 --> 01:15:05,082
TRAVIS: And that's the first one, called shot.

1124
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:11,031
MATT: With that, thunk, the blade finds its way
into his side, as you hear cracking on the rock

1125
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:18,426
below him, the sound of the left gauntlet,
(cracking) hitting the bottom of the square. The

1126
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:22,487
fingers twitch in the gauntlet as he's currently
standing there with his left arm bisected from the

1127
01:15:22,487 --> 01:15:23,979
rest of his body.

1128
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,750
LAURA: Does he shrink?

1129
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,561
MATT: No.

1130
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:29,185
LAURA: Dammit.

1131
01:15:29,185 --> 01:15:31,482
TRAVIS: Second attack, straight across his back.

1132
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:32,802
MATT: Okay, straight into his back?

1133
01:15:32,802 --> 01:15:38,742
SAM: Does another smaller doll hand come out to
replace it?

1134
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,384
LAURA: Teeny tiny.

1135
01:15:41,384 --> 01:15:44,942
TRAVIS: That is a 22.

1136
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:46,336
MATT: 22 hits.

1137
01:15:46,336 --> 01:15:57,582
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22. Okay. And that's four, so double
this-- 12, right? So four times two is eight. Plus

1138
01:15:57,582 --> 01:16:10,324
four is 11. Math is a bitch. And two more of them?
Because it's a critical? Okay. Seven. And a nine.

1139
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:13,249
MATT: 28, half that is 14.

1140
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:16,414
LAURA: Math! Math is fun!

1141
01:16:16,414 --> 01:16:21,298
MATT: So you're hacking into him, you see the
wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the

1142
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:26,520
amount of pain that's wracking him at this time.
He's still holding up against a lot of damage

1143
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,074
that's come to him, but he's starting to look a
little rough.

1144
01:16:29,074 --> 01:16:36,521
TRAVIS: So I have my third frenzied attack for a
bonus action, right? With my bonus action I have

1145
01:16:36,521 --> 01:16:40,439
one superior healing potion. Can I take that?

1146
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:54,031
MATT: You can, yeah. That will heal you, a
superior, let's see. Superior is 8d4 plus eight.

1147
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,469
TRAVIS: 8d4 plus eight?

1148
01:16:55,469 --> 01:16:58,058
MATT: Your superior, that's the expensive one you
guys got.

1149
01:16:58,058 --> 01:17:01,460
LIAM: 8d4, four-sided, the four-sided. Pyramids.

1150
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:19,696
TRAVIS: Fuck me, asshole. Fuck. Fuck me asshole!
Seven. Nine. Ele-- 12. 14. 16. 19. 20. 20.

1151
01:17:19,696 --> 01:17:23,331
MATT: All right, so you heal 20. All right, that
ends your turn, Grog. All righty. Unless you want

1152
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:24,384
to move.

1153
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:26,490
TRAVIS: Can I, can I-- huh?

1154
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,143
LAURA: You could pick it up.

1155
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,978
TRAVIS: I can't pick it up, I can only move.

1156
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:34,288
MATT: I mean, you have, you wouldn't be able to
wield your axe.

1157
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:37,809
LAURA: But can you put it in the Bag of Holding?

1158
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:39,524
MATT: Next turn, if you want to try it.

1159
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:45,021
TRAVIS: No, I'm going to, can I move, if I stay in
his flank, if I move away from the three guys that

1160
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:46,126
are surrounding me, they're--

1161
01:17:46,126 --> 01:17:47,674
MATT: They're all going to get an attack on you.

1162
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:48,971
TRAVIS: I'll stay.

1163
01:17:48,971 --> 01:17:51,412
MATT: All right. All right, so that finishes your
turn, Grog.

1164
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:52,408
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you.

1165
01:17:52,408 --> 01:17:58,724
MATT: Next up is Greenbeard, who is currently
frozen in place, however, rolls an 18 plus five,

1166
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:04,950
as far as, his wisdom is plus ten, so that puts
him at 28. So he resists the Hold Person and is

1167
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:09,389
currently no longer affected by that. All right,
that finishes his turn, though, because that's the

1168
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:10,960
end of his turn. Percy, you're up.

1169
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:17,567
TALIESIN: All right. This is going to be fun. That
asshole who just shot me, I'm now aiming at him.

1170
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:28,231
And I'm going to push him off the roof, this'll be
fun. So, pushing him off the roof, am I going to

1171
01:18:28,231 --> 01:18:30,610
do extra damage to him, or am I?

1172
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:33,073
LIAM: If he hits. If he hits the ground.

1173
01:18:33,073 --> 01:18:36,361
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I'm debating whether or
not to sharpshooter it to do-- no, I think I'll

1174
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:39,059
just push him off the roof. It's funnier.

1175
01:18:39,059 --> 01:18:40,855
TRAVIS: I can feel my heartbeat in my face.

1176
01:18:40,855 --> 01:18:45,450
LAURA: I know, I can't tell if it's actually
really warm in here or if we're all just really hot.

1177
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:48,374
MATT: Probably a little bit of column A, a little
bit of column B. What was it?

1178
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:49,469
TALIESIN: 28 to hit.

1179
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:51,380
MATT: 28 hits. Non-sharpshooter?

1180
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,470
TALIESIN: Non-sharpshooter.

1181
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,692
SAM: Dullshooter.

1182
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:59,952
TALIESIN: But I'm doing a torso shot. So he gets
no save, there's no save for the torso shot, he's

1183
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:03,136
going to take his damage and move ten feet away
from me.

1184
01:19:03,136 --> 01:19:04,177
MATT: Okay.

1185
01:19:04,177 --> 01:19:09,921
TALIESIN: So. That's 14 points of damage, of
piercing damage.

1186
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:13,582
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage and he gets
shoved off the back of the roof, he's going to

1187
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:19,322
make an acrobatics check, which he succeeds, so he
lands down there and he only takes one point of

1188
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:21,716
damage from the fall, but. There you go.

1189
01:19:21,716 --> 01:19:30,999
TALIESIN: Fine. I'm going to reload, and now, what
am I going to do? Let's see.

1190
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,370
SAM: Jump down the chimney, deliver presents.

1191
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,933
TALIESIN: Surveying the field, trying to make some
decisions.

1192
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:38,520
SAM: Help Pike!

1193
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,006
TALIESIN: I can't. Well!

1194
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:41,814
MARISHA: Can you hit Greenbeard?

1195
01:19:41,814 --> 01:19:45,916
TALIESIN: I can hit Greenbeard, I'm going to hit
Greenbeard. He's got the magicky creepy thing, right?

1196
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:49,465
LAURA: Yeah, he's gross. He's got mold on his
neck.

1197
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:51,944
MATT: Fungal moss on his whole neck and chest
area.

1198
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:59,372
TALIESIN: All right. Well, we'll see how things
go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now.

1199
01:19:59,372 --> 01:20:06,165
Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him.
So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my

1200
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:08,512
pistol goes (breaking sound).

1201
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,256
(groaning)

1202
01:20:10,256 --> 01:20:11,640
MATT: All right.

1203
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,597
TALIESIN: And I'm putting it away, so.

1204
01:20:13,597 --> 01:20:16,870
MATT: Okay, all right, so that's going to end your
turn? Keyleth, you're up.

1205
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:22,325
MARISHA: All right. Tornado's coming down the
house. I'm going to hit these two guys with a

1206
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:23,688
Whirlwind again.

1207
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:24,877
MATT: Right here?

1208
01:20:24,877 --> 01:20:27,926
MARISHA: Yep. 13 strength save.

1209
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:37,826
MATT: 13 strength saves on both of them. Archers--
all right. That's a natural 19 plus two, and two

1210
01:20:37,826 --> 01:20:40,006
natural 19s in a row. Yeah, they both make their
saves.

1211
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:58,057
MARISHA: So nine plus-- oh, one more d8. Plus
another five, so that was 12 plus five is 17,

1212
01:20:58,057 --> 01:20:59,959
plus another two, so 19 halved.

1213
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:05,533
MATT: 19 halved? All right, so that puts them at
nine points of bludgeoning damage each. Not really

1214
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:08,843
having much of an effect at this point in the
fight, however, as you swirl around, picking up

1215
01:21:08,843 --> 01:21:12,440
the debris from the roof as you can, it slams into
them and they brace against it, but they still,

1216
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,727
glancing over their shoulder, realize that they've
got to continue what they're doing now. The bigger

1217
01:21:16,727 --> 01:21:18,786
threat appears to be out in front of them.

1218
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:20,963
MARISHA: I'm staying in their space, by the way.

1219
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:24,944
MATT: Right, right, so you're up in there. Up in
their shit.

1220
01:21:24,944 --> 01:21:28,659
LAURA: Up in their business? Oh, it fell anyway!
It happened.

1221
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:34,870
MATT: There you go. No. All righty. Finished your
turn? All right. Pike, you're up.

1222
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,281
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to put on my
Sprinter's Boots.

1223
01:21:37,281 --> 01:21:39,662
MATT: They're on you, right?

1224
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:40,820
ASHLEY: What's that?

1225
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:44,766
MATT: So you're getting up, that's half your
movement to stand up, all right.

1226
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:50,866
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to run around
towards the back of the house.

1227
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:52,359
MATT: This way?

1228
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:54,163
SAM: Door.

1229
01:21:54,163 --> 01:22:04,352
MATT: What're you doing? Ashley, what're you
doing? So your Sprinter's Boots activate, which

1230
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:10,193
gives you double movement. Right? So you can move
50 feet. But you moved up, it took you 25 to stand

1231
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:14,361
up because it's half your speed to get up from
prone, so you still have 25 feet you can move.

1232
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:16,413
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go around to the
side.

1233
01:22:16,413 --> 01:22:22,815
MATT: This side? All right, so you move. Here?
Right?

1234
01:22:22,815 --> 01:22:24,186
ASHLEY: Yeah, as far as it'll--

1235
01:22:24,186 --> 01:22:28,177
MATT: Okay, so you rush over there. That one guy
takes a swing at you as you rush by, gah!, or girl

1236
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:36,381
I should say, the female half-elf swings with the
giant blade. That's going to be a 23?

1237
01:22:36,381 --> 01:22:38,056
ASHLEY: Fuck. Yeah.

1238
01:22:38,056 --> 01:22:46,651
MATT: Okay. As the blade smacks you from behind as
you rush past, you suffer 14 points of slashing

1239
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:52,514
damage. In your back. But you keep running around
the edge. All right, what are you doing?

1240
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:55,192
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to heal myself.

1241
01:22:55,192 --> 01:22:56,510
MATT: All righty.

1242
01:22:56,510 --> 01:23:08,371
ASHLEY: A little, doing a little rough here. I'm
going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. At third level.

1243
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:22,357
SAM: Isn't this exciting?

1244
01:23:22,357 --> 01:23:23,958
LIAM: Yes it is!

1245
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,127
MARISHA: Good times, guys.

1246
01:23:25,127 --> 01:23:26,691
SAM: We're fighting a horde of goliaths!

1247
01:23:26,691 --> 01:23:28,186
MATT: What you got, Ashley?

1248
01:23:28,186 --> 01:23:29,688
ASHLEY: What's that?

1249
01:23:29,688 --> 01:23:30,739
MATT: What you got, what you doing?

1250
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:31,854
ASHLEY: Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself.

1251
01:23:31,854 --> 01:23:33,501
MATT: And you're done? You're healed up? Okay,
that's the end of your turn.

1252
01:23:33,501 --> 01:23:34,793
ASHLEY: I can't do any, don't I have a bonus
action?

1253
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,058
MATT: You have a bonus action still if you want.

1254
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:37,372
LAURA: You got your spiritual weapon still.

1255
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:42,790
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon
on him again, on Kevdak.

1256
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,777
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and swing for the attack
on that one.

1257
01:23:45,777 --> 01:23:54,972
ASHLEY: Okay, and I'm going to use Guided Strike?

1258
01:23:54,972 --> 01:24:01,095
MATT: Well, I mean, yeah, you have advantage. You
have advantage on the attack, by the way, he's

1259
01:24:01,095 --> 01:24:03,622
paralyzed. He's still paralyzed.

1260
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:06,971
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

1261
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,331
ASHLEY: It's still under it.

1262
01:24:08,331 --> 01:24:10,607
LAURA: Don't you add anything to it?

1263
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:11,870
MATT: Add your spell attack.

1264
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:15,353
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm
forgetting everything, I'm so nervous!

1265
01:24:15,353 --> 01:24:17,346
MATT: It's okay, you've been away for a while.

1266
01:24:17,346 --> 01:24:20,158
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. 22.

1267
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:25,283
MATT: 22? That hits. So go ahead and roll your
3d8, I think it is, no, 4d8.

1268
01:24:25,283 --> 01:24:26,737
LAURA: 4d8.

1269
01:24:26,737 --> 01:24:32,043
MATT: Plus your wisdom modifier, which is plus--
what's your wisdom modifier?

1270
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:36,579
SAM: She's doing math, give her a second.

1271
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:42,060
TALIESIN: Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's
within five feet.

1272
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:42,891
MATT: Yeah.

1273
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:44,074
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1274
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:47,879
SAM: (nerdy voice) Oh, the weapon's within five
feet.

1275
01:24:47,879 --> 01:24:49,201
LAURA: Do you add the spell attack bonus to it?

1276
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:50,519
TALIESIN: Suck it, nerd. Dear god.

1277
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:52,921
MATT: No, it's not attack, it's your wisdom
modifier, but what's the dice, the dice are

1278
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,155
doubled because it's a critical hit.

1279
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,165
TRAVIS: 18.

1280
01:24:55,165 --> 01:24:56,119
LAURA: Times two.

1281
01:24:56,119 --> 01:24:59,956
MATT: 36, half that to 18. Then add your wisdom
modifier.

1282
01:24:59,956 --> 01:25:03,190
LAURA: Plus four!

1283
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:10,511
MATT: Plus four. All right, so. Half of that would
be two, so 20. 20 points of damage to him from the

1284
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:14,919
strike of that. All righty, that finishes your
turn.

1285
01:25:14,919 --> 01:25:17,435
TRAVIS: Does your piece of paper back there look
like Stephen Hawking's chalkboard?

1286
01:25:17,435 --> 01:25:19,103
MATT: Kind of, right now, yeah.

1287
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:21,341
SAM: Wow.

1288
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:24,056
LAURA: That's actually way more organized than I
thought it would be.

1289
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:28,806
TRAVIS: Young Stephen Hawking. You horrible,
horrible person.

1290
01:25:28,806 --> 01:25:37,705
MATT: First, the woman who just swung past you is
going to go ahead and rush around the corner as

1291
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:44,510
well and follow you, since you got out of the way.
Rush into and go after you, Pike. The three that

1292
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:49,715
are on you, Grog, are still going to, after
watching you cut one of Kevdak's arms off, roar

1293
01:25:49,715 --> 01:25:56,179
angrily around you, all three of them (roar), and
go into another round of angry, angry strikes

1294
01:25:56,179 --> 01:25:57,357
against you.

1295
01:25:57,357 --> 01:25:58,605
LAURA: Oh god.

1296
01:25:58,605 --> 01:26:02,676
MATT: All right, so that comes to you, Grog, since
you did reckless attack on him for the stuff, they

1297
01:26:02,676 --> 01:26:06,282
all have advantage on you anyway, so all the
attacks are with advantage, that's six attacks.

1298
01:26:06,282 --> 01:26:08,581
MARISHA: Six attacks.

1299
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:09,932
MATT: That's a natural 20.

1300
01:26:09,932 --> 01:26:11,424
(yelling)

1301
01:26:11,424 --> 01:26:19,080
MATT: 26 on the second. 23 on the third.

1302
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,630
TRAVIS: Hits.

1303
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:24,680
MATT: 24 on the fourth.

1304
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,784
TALIESIN: Can you roll poorly?

1305
01:26:26,784 --> 01:26:29,587
MATT: 26 on the fifth.

1306
01:26:29,587 --> 01:26:31,110
SAM: Wow.

1307
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:33,483
LIAM: Welcome to our production of Julius Caesar.

1308
01:26:33,483 --> 01:26:35,246
MATT: No, they all, five hits and one crit.

1309
01:26:35,246 --> 01:26:36,504
LAURA: What?

1310
01:26:36,504 --> 01:26:42,619
MATT: They all hit, yeah. Reckless attack puts you
in a bad position when you're surrounded with guys

1311
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:44,556
that can do multiple hits that are also
barbarians.

1312
01:26:44,556 --> 01:26:46,185
LIAM: Here it comes.

1313
01:26:46,185 --> 01:26:51,410
MARISHA: Get that barbarian's resistance.

1314
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:53,356
MATT: We'll do the crit first on you.

1315
01:26:53,356 --> 01:26:54,464
TRAVIS: Okay.

1316
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,488
MATT: You already used the Stone's Resistance. Oh,
the barbarian, yeah. So that'll help.

1317
01:26:57,488 --> 01:26:59,472
TRAVIS: Don't say the word yet.

1318
01:26:59,472 --> 01:27:00,627
MARISHA: Well.

1319
01:27:00,627 --> 01:27:02,479
SAM: Is it that thing where you die?

1320
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:07,523
MATT: Seven plus eight, 15, reduced to half,
that's seven. So I'll give you the direct amounts

1321
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:16,394
here. So this is with the reduction. So that's
seven points of slashing damage. Another seven.

1322
01:27:16,394 --> 01:27:17,826
TRAVIS: Okay.

1323
01:27:17,826 --> 01:27:21,596
MATT: Another seven.

1324
01:27:21,596 --> 01:27:22,842
TRAVIS: Okay.

1325
01:27:22,842 --> 01:27:25,771
MATT: Here we go. That's a nine.

1326
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:26,930
TRAVIS: Okay.

1327
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:30,068
MATT: Not that great. That's a six.

1328
01:27:30,068 --> 01:27:31,195
TRAVIS: Okay.

1329
01:27:31,195 --> 01:27:32,662
MATT: And then now the crit.

1330
01:27:32,662 --> 01:27:36,044
LAURA: I thought you said the first one was a
crit.

1331
01:27:36,044 --> 01:27:39,867
LIAM: That's what you said.

1332
01:27:39,867 --> 01:27:42,619
MATT: And then I thought differently but I didn't
say it out loud, but because you're calling me on

1333
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:43,779
it, I'll let it happen.

1334
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:45,305
ALL: No, no, no.

1335
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:48,984
LIAM: Are you saying what's in your head is
different than what's in my head?

1336
01:27:48,984 --> 01:27:56,112
MATT: Okay. That was double sixes. So that's 22
plus eight is 30, so 15 points of slashing damage.

1337
01:27:56,112 --> 01:28:00,308
On all those strikes against you. Pike? Two
attacks on you.

1338
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,105
SAM: You still alive there?

1339
01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:07,960
MATT: That's a natural 20. And that's 15.

1340
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,001
ASHLEY: No.

1341
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:16,486
MATT: No, so. That is a one and two, so that's
three, six plus eight, you take 14 points of

1342
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:20,619
slashing damage from this barbarian female who's
all up on your grill.

1343
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:22,295
ASHLEY: I hate this bitch!

1344
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:27,768
MATT: Ending that turn, it's now the druid's turn
over here. End of surprise round, the druid's

1345
01:28:27,768 --> 01:28:37,506
going to rush forward here. And do a 5th-level
Cure Wounds. On Kevdak.

1346
01:28:37,506 --> 01:28:39,171
TALIESIN: No!

1347
01:28:39,171 --> 01:28:43,320
MARISHA: I mean, he doesn't have an arm, he
doesn't have the arm. That was-- he can't get that back.

1348
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,338
LIAM: He can't get the bone or stuff, I hope.

1349
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:47,951
MARISHA: I know, how does that work if you only
have half your--

1350
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:49,557
LIAM: Ask that guy.

1351
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:54,112
MATT: All right, we're looking at 5d8.

1352
01:28:54,112 --> 01:28:58,717
SAM: You know what? Fuck it. I'll Counterspell
that.

1353
01:28:58,717 --> 01:29:06,514
MATT: Yeah, it's too high, or no, okay. So. It's
at a fifth level. Go ahead and roll for it,

1354
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:14,444
adding, so it's d20 plus five, plus two because of
your bardic knowledge.

1355
01:29:14,444 --> 01:29:16,308
LAURA: That's not concentration, it doesn't do
anything.

1356
01:29:16,308 --> 01:29:20,529
SAM: It's not concentration, right, Counterspell?
So what do I do, just a d20?

1357
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,250
MATT: Roll a d20, add seven.

1358
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:25,743
SAM: 17.

1359
01:29:25,743 --> 01:29:32,379
MATT: Let me check here real fast. Plus the
spell's level. Yeah. It's dispelled.

1360
01:29:32,379 --> 01:29:34,261
SAM: It's dispelled?

1361
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:35,357
MATT: Yeah, Counterspell.

1362
01:29:35,357 --> 01:29:37,749
(cheering)

1363
01:29:37,749 --> 01:29:40,062
MATT: It was 15, was what he had to beat.

1364
01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:41,951
MARISHA: MVP this fight!

1365
01:29:41,951 --> 01:29:43,633
TALIESIN: Oh my god, Sam. Oh my god.

1366
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:45,534
LIAM: Scanlan's going to Disneyworld!

1367
01:29:45,534 --> 01:30:09,242
MATT: Okay. (laughs) All right. That ends his
turn. Now. So. This guy here, let's see. Got to

1368
01:30:09,242 --> 01:30:10,874
stand up for this one, pardon me.

1369
01:30:10,874 --> 01:30:12,370
SAM: Oh, shoot.

1370
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:19,758
LAURA: Shit. Shit.

1371
01:30:19,758 --> 01:30:22,894
ASHLEY: Should we just take a break or something?

1372
01:30:22,894 --> 01:30:32,108
SAM: The benches we're sitting on are covered in so
much ass sweat right now.

1373
01:30:32,108 --> 01:30:35,855
MATT: We'll say for the sake of this, going to put
him up there.

1374
01:30:35,855 --> 01:30:39,785
SAM: Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on
right there?

1375
01:30:39,785 --> 01:30:41,518
MATT: This guy jumps up this way.

1376
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:44,972
SAM: Hey wait, well, that's where I am, I don't
want him to come up there!

1377
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,345
MATT: Too bad.

1378
01:30:46,345 --> 01:30:47,810
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?

1379
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:53,946
MATT: These two guys rush forward and grab these
innocents here.

1380
01:30:53,946 --> 01:30:55,967
LAURA: Oh my god. This is where it all turns.

1381
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:58,442
ASHLEY: Because I fucking fell off the fucking
roof.

1382
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:01,001
MATT: Yeah, into the middle here, towards the
fire.

1383
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:02,309
LIAM: Head of the snake.

1384
01:31:02,309 --> 01:31:04,454
MARISHA: Into the fire? What?

1385
01:31:04,454 --> 01:31:12,281
MATT: Pushing them towards the fire with what
remains of their movement. Let's see, this guy's

1386
01:31:12,281 --> 01:31:19,121
going to move in towards Grog there. This archer's
going to get back up--

1387
01:31:19,121 --> 01:31:21,955
SAM: (belches) Pardon me. Was that out loud?

1388
01:31:21,955 --> 01:31:25,340
MARISHA: It's okay, we're not live.

1389
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:26,774
LAURA: No!

1390
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:31,283
MATT: Well actually, no, archers aren't part of
this movement. This guy here's going to move into

1391
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:32,711
Grog there.

1392
01:31:32,711 --> 01:31:34,752
SAM: Now he has seven people attacking him.

1393
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:52,246
MATT: I don't know what to tell you, man. These
guys here, seeing, hah. This guy's going to be up

1394
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:56,921
with this one here. This guy can't really get over
there, so he's going to go ahead and rush

1395
01:31:56,921 --> 01:31:58,187
forward.

1396
01:31:58,187 --> 01:32:01,056
LAURA: How many people are there? I feel like
there's so many more people than there were.

1397
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:02,702
TALIESIN: How do you own this many models?

1398
01:32:02,702 --> 01:32:05,743
LAURA: Why are you doing this to Pike? Stop
hurting her!

1399
01:32:05,743 --> 01:32:08,273
SAM: Only you can protect her.

1400
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:10,257
ASHLEY: We should've killed the guys first.

1401
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:13,240
TALIESIN: There's no should'ves, this is what we
got.

1402
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,630
ASHLEY: Okay guys, we can do this, we can do
this.

1403
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:20,458
MARISHA: It was going pretty well.

1404
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:23,096
LAURA: Why did it all turn?

1405
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:24,812
MARISHA: How did he fucking scale that fast?

1406
01:32:24,812 --> 01:32:27,199
LAURA: Because he can roll acrobatics just like we
can!

1407
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:30,882
MATT: Because they're-- yeah, you guys can do it,
they can do it too. And they're pretty strong. So

1408
01:32:30,882 --> 01:32:35,655
he basically runs up, puts the sword on his back,
jumps up onto the roof, pulls the weapon. He

1409
01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:38,209
doesn't manage to get an attack on you, because it
took all of his movement to get up there. But he

1410
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:39,452
gets up there.

1411
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:41,704
MARISHA: No one wants to fuck with the elemental?
Really? No one?

1412
01:32:41,704 --> 01:32:48,326
MATT: Right now, you're not a huge threat to them
at the moment and they're both going to focus

1413
01:32:48,326 --> 01:32:52,751
actually on you, Scanlan. When it gets around to
their turn, though. This guy's going to go ahead

1414
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:58,328
and pull both of these innocent folk in front of
them as a shield. This guy's going to get freaked

1415
01:32:58,328 --> 01:33:05,556
out, rush around the building and try to escape
there. Okay. So! Bringing us into the combat

1416
01:33:05,556 --> 01:33:12,361
portion of the round, Grog, you have two more
attacking you. This is the bladestorms.

1417
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:14,972
TRAVIS: Bladestorms?

1418
01:33:14,972 --> 01:33:17,717
MATT: With advantage, that's going to be a 14.

1419
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,986
TRAVIS: That'll miss. I haven't said that much
tonight.

1420
01:33:20,986 --> 01:33:22,228
MATT: 18?

1421
01:33:22,228 --> 01:33:23,705
TRAVIS: That misses.

1422
01:33:23,705 --> 01:33:27,365
MATT: So first one, both attacks swinging across
you, you're feeling it on your back, but it's

1423
01:33:27,365 --> 01:33:31,563
catching most of your armor and part of your flesh
that is nice and calloused and does not really do

1424
01:33:31,563 --> 01:33:40,382
any damage. The second one rolls a 20. Second one,
and second attack on the second one is a 21.

1425
01:33:40,382 --> 01:33:42,573
TRAVIS: That hits, yeah.

1426
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:49,564
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So you get a critical and hit on
this one. So this is the bladestorm. Critical is

1427
01:33:49,564 --> 01:33:59,920
going to be 16, eight points of slashing damage on
that one. And the next one's going to be four

1428
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,503
points of slashing damage. This is already halved.
Just so you know. So that's that round there.

1429
01:34:04,503 --> 01:34:13,106
Against Pike, only one of them could get to you
and still attack this round, so Pike, that's 19?

1430
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:15,605
ASHLEY: Misses.

1431
01:34:15,605 --> 01:34:18,387
MATT: And that's going to be a 15.

1432
01:34:18,387 --> 01:34:19,714
ASHLEY: Misses.

1433
01:34:19,714 --> 01:34:22,744
MATT: So one strikes against you, hits the back of
the armor and streaks off, so you spin around as

1434
01:34:22,744 --> 01:34:25,509
the second blade comes around and you deflect it
with the shield angrily.

1435
01:34:25,509 --> 01:34:26,702
MARISHA: Yes!

1436
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:28,388
ASHLEY: This is so fucking stressful!

1437
01:34:28,388 --> 01:34:33,173
MATT: That brings us back to the top of the
initiative order. Vex, you're up.

1438
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:36,163
SAM: What, they just approached me, they didn't
attack me?

1439
01:34:36,163 --> 01:34:39,296
MATT: Oh, there was the one guy that got up there
with movement. Thank you for the reminder. So

1440
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:42,930
before that happens, actually, reminder, this one
did have enough movement to get up there and still

1441
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:44,191
get attacks off on you.

1442
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:45,509
LAURA: Okay, he's attacking Percy.

1443
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:46,607
SAM: No, he's attacking me.

1444
01:34:46,607 --> 01:34:48,172
LAURA: Oh.

1445
01:34:48,172 --> 01:34:51,949
MATT: That's going to be a 13 with the first
strike.

1446
01:34:51,949 --> 01:34:53,712
SAM: That misses.

1447
01:34:53,712 --> 01:34:56,479
MATT: Misses, second one's going to be a 22.

1448
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:57,903
SAM: That just hits.

1449
01:34:57,903 --> 01:35:00,044
(laughter)

1450
01:35:00,044 --> 01:35:08,781
MATT: All right, that's going to be 17 points of
slashing damage from that greatsword, whoosh. I

1451
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:10,926
need you to go ahead and make a concentration
check.

1452
01:35:10,926 --> 01:35:13,004
LAURA: Oh no!

1453
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:17,286
MATT: Yeah, you have Warcaster, so you have
advantage on that.

1454
01:35:17,286 --> 01:35:18,481
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

1455
01:35:18,481 --> 01:35:19,673
SAM: 15-- plus anything?

1456
01:35:19,673 --> 01:35:21,321
MATT: It's a constitution.

1457
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:24,108
SAM: Ooh. Plus two. 17.

1458
01:35:24,108 --> 01:35:25,338
MATT: So 17.

1459
01:35:25,338 --> 01:35:26,835
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

1460
01:35:26,835 --> 01:35:34,003
MATT: Going to check it real fast, concentration
here-- plus ten, half the damage you take. So that

1461
01:35:34,003 --> 01:35:36,718
would be ten, yeah, you maintain concentration.

1462
01:35:36,718 --> 01:35:38,087
LAURA: Oh, thank god.

1463
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:42,318
TRAVIS: We might as well just be doing this on a
treadmill, because I think I'm pretty close to 130?

1464
01:35:42,318 --> 01:35:43,820
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

1465
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:46,297
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to fly out of the window on
the broom.

1466
01:35:46,297 --> 01:35:50,013
LIAM: The roof blows off.

1467
01:35:50,013 --> 01:35:52,605
LAURA: Out of the window.

1468
01:35:52,605 --> 01:35:55,803
MATT: Where do you want to go?

1469
01:35:55,803 --> 01:36:06,053
LAURA: I'm going to fly down and I'm going to
shout, Grog! Raise your arm! And I'm going to go

1470
01:36:06,053 --> 01:36:09,181
down and I'm going to hit his hand with the
Pokeball.

1471
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,703
LIAM: Shit.

1472
01:36:10,703 --> 01:36:12,531
MATT: You're going to scoot by here?

1473
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:19,003
LAURA: I'm above, I want to be high up in the air
but low enough that I can reach down and touch the

1474
01:36:19,003 --> 01:36:21,707
locket to Grog's hand.

1475
01:36:21,707 --> 01:36:24,454
MATT: Okay, it's a good thing Kevdak is paralyzed,
because otherwise he'd get an attack on you.

1476
01:36:24,454 --> 01:36:25,751
LAURA: I know, I know.

1477
01:36:25,751 --> 01:36:28,028
MATT: This will put you in range for their
strikes, so you're going to have to stay in place

1478
01:36:28,028 --> 01:36:31,330
or move past and suffer five attacks of
opportunity.

1479
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:34,566
LAURA: Wait, all of them can attack, but I'm in
the air!

1480
01:36:34,566 --> 01:36:38,342
MATT: But for you to get low enough to hand him
that, they all have big double greatswords, and

1481
01:36:38,342 --> 01:36:43,605
they're-- well, half of them are half-giants. So
you can do this. As you swish up, which you've

1482
01:36:43,605 --> 01:36:46,014
already said you're going to do, you fly up and
you reach down.

1483
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:47,662
LAURA: With the locket and I hit.

1484
01:36:47,662 --> 01:36:49,109
MATT: With the locket and you hand over to him, do
you--

1485
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:50,405
LAURA: I don't hand it to him.

1486
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:51,804
MATT: Okay. So you just hold it there?

1487
01:36:51,804 --> 01:36:53,789
LAURA: I'm putting Grog in the fucking locket.

1488
01:36:53,789 --> 01:36:56,018
MATT: Oh.

1489
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:58,721
TRAVIS: She's trying to medevac me.

1490
01:36:58,721 --> 01:37:03,202
MATT: I misunderstood what you were trying to do.
All right, so, what--

1491
01:37:03,202 --> 01:37:04,997
LAURA: I want to fly by and poof and keep going.

1492
01:37:04,997 --> 01:37:06,362
MATT: What's it say again?

1493
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,697
LAURA: It's a wisdom save, but if it's a willing
person they can go in.

1494
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:11,085
MATT: Yeah. So, Grog, are you willing?

1495
01:37:11,085 --> 01:37:14,531
TRAVIS: Well. Yes.

1496
01:37:14,531 --> 01:37:22,787
MATT: And with that, as you reach down and touch
Grog with it, you see Grog's form shimmer for a

1497
01:37:22,787 --> 01:37:25,766
second into dark shadow, and then vanish inside--

1498
01:37:25,766 --> 01:37:28,431
LAURA: And I want to fly on past and go up to the
next roof.

1499
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:32,757
MATT: Okay. So Grog is currently off the table as
he's locked inside the gauntlet.

1500
01:37:32,757 --> 01:37:34,800
LAURA: Where should I go, where should I go?

1501
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,699
MATT: Where are you going? As you rush away, you
do get--

1502
01:37:37,699 --> 01:37:42,373
LAURA: I'm going to fly back into the-- I'm going
to fly around the back of the big building.

1503
01:37:42,373 --> 01:37:43,496
MATT: Back here, you mean?

1504
01:37:43,496 --> 01:37:44,558
LAURA: Yeah.

1505
01:37:44,558 --> 01:37:50,508
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this,
you are back here.

1506
01:37:50,508 --> 01:37:51,774
LAURA: Okay.

1507
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:56,897
MATT: As you fly off from doing this, all of them
swing wide at you, that's five attacks of

1508
01:37:56,897 --> 01:38:01,533
opportunity against you. That's 20.

1509
01:38:01,533 --> 01:38:02,962
LAURA: Hits.

1510
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:05,080
MATT: That is 17.

1511
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,484
LAURA: It did? What'd you, what'd you give me?

1512
01:38:08,484 --> 01:38:10,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, she gave you, she handed out, before
we moved out.

1513
01:38:10,608 --> 01:38:12,461
LAURA: Oh, that's right, she gave me a blessing.

1514
01:38:12,461 --> 01:38:15,417
MATT: Well, it's Aid, you have 15 extra hit
points. So that's what it is.

1515
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:16,607
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1516
01:38:16,607 --> 01:38:18,373
ASHLEY: I thought it was the armor class goes up
one.

1517
01:38:18,373 --> 01:38:19,898
SAM: I got 15 extra hit points.

1518
01:38:19,898 --> 01:38:24,217
MATT: Yeah, Aid just gives you guys extra hit
points. So anyway. 17. Doesn't hit. All right. So

1519
01:38:24,217 --> 01:38:28,287
three more attacks. That was cocked. 19?

1520
01:38:28,287 --> 01:38:30,209
LAURA: It's my armor class.

1521
01:38:30,209 --> 01:38:31,948
MATT: All right, 26?

1522
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,655
LAURA: Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch.

1523
01:38:33,655 --> 01:38:36,077
MATT: And that's 19 again. So four attacks hit
you.

1524
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,179
LAURA: Okay.

1525
01:38:37,179 --> 01:38:42,256
MATT: First one is for 14 points of slashing
damage.

1526
01:38:42,256 --> 01:38:43,854
LAURA: Okay.

1527
01:38:43,854 --> 01:38:55,482
MATT: Next one, hoo, that's eight, 12 points of
slashing damage.

1528
01:38:55,482 --> 01:38:56,592
LAURA: Okay.

1529
01:38:56,592 --> 01:38:59,032
SAM: Doubled. Halved.

1530
01:38:59,032 --> 01:39:01,829
TALIESIN: Stop it! Don't be helpful!

1531
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:05,063
MATT: Nine plus four-- another 13 points of
slashing damage.

1532
01:39:05,063 --> 01:39:06,653
LAURA: Dammit. Okay.

1533
01:39:06,653 --> 01:39:10,849
MATT: And the last one. That's going to be 15
points of slashing damage.

1534
01:39:10,849 --> 01:39:15,651
LAURA: Great, cool, great. I'm fine and I'm just
going to keep going.

1535
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:19,506
MATT: You streak off as all these blades hammer
into your side, cutting the bottom of your feet,

1536
01:39:19,506 --> 01:39:23,858
one of them hits you in the back of the neck and
curves across your lower back, and as you pull

1537
01:39:23,858 --> 01:39:28,208
away clutching it, you look at your hand with the
blood pooling in the middle of your palm, and you

1538
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:33,950
look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of
a human inside the gem that's currently mingling

1539
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:38,208
with all the blood that's smeared across your
body, as all of a sudden you coast around, through

1540
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:43,478
the air, the wind whirling past you, and you spin
around towards the top of the Margrave's estate.

1541
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:48,297
And you can hear the blood in your body--
(heartbeat sounds)-- in your ears as you start

1542
01:39:48,297 --> 01:39:52,818
getting a little dizzy and realizing just how
rough you are at the moment from that exchange.

1543
01:39:52,818 --> 01:39:54,061
LAURA: Okay.

1544
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:55,296
MARISHA: Wow.

1545
01:39:55,296 --> 01:40:06,259
MATT: Technically you'd probably be higher than
this. Up there, if you wanted to fly around. Okay.

1546
01:40:06,259 --> 01:40:07,920
So. That ends your turn?

1547
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,342
LAURA: That-- yeah.

1548
01:40:11,342 --> 01:40:12,734
MATT: Vax, you're up.

1549
01:40:12,734 --> 01:40:16,865
LIAM: I'm going to use my bonus action to dash,
and hasted I get 24 squares of movement

1550
01:40:16,865 --> 01:40:17,829
on this board.

1551
01:40:17,829 --> 01:40:18,891
MATT: Yes.

1552
01:40:18,891 --> 01:40:22,665
LIAM: I'm going to drop off the roof, staying
along the wall, I should be able to take a

1553
01:40:22,665 --> 01:40:26,240
diagonal at that corner and totally avoid
Greenbeard.

1554
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,974
MATT: Oh, you mean, dodge off--?

1555
01:40:27,974 --> 01:40:32,250
LIAM: I want to go, no, I want to go straight this
way. Towards the tree, and drop.

1556
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,077
MATT: Towards the tree, drop off here?

1557
01:40:34,077 --> 01:40:41,234
LIAM: All right. Yep. I want to go along the wall.
I can swoop around it and avoid Greenbeard, I'm

1558
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:45,465
going to run past this barbarian, she'll probably
take an attack but I'm wearing that cloak so she's

1559
01:40:45,465 --> 01:40:51,508
at disadvantage. I'm going to run up to Kevdak and
I'm going to stab him twice-- I should get sneak

1560
01:40:51,508 --> 01:40:53,602
attack damage and a crit, because he's frozen.

1561
01:40:53,602 --> 01:40:54,724
MATT: You do.

1562
01:40:54,724 --> 01:40:56,639
LIAM: Then I'm going to run the fuck out. That's
what I'd like to do.

1563
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:57,566
MATT: Okay.

1564
01:40:57,566 --> 01:40:58,824
(laughter)

1565
01:40:58,824 --> 01:41:02,021
MATT: You rush up, you manage to avoid Greenbeard,
there is one of these guys there who was holding

1566
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:05,894
his place, seeing what things were going on, he
had no target at the moment, was staying nearby.

1567
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:11,513
With disadvantage, that is 21?

1568
01:41:11,513 --> 01:41:13,544
LIAM: Misses. 22.

1569
01:41:13,544 --> 01:41:14,617
MATT: 22!

1570
01:41:14,617 --> 01:41:18,827
LIAM: Daggers out, hasted. Raven Queen armor, fuck
y'all.

1571
01:41:18,827 --> 01:41:25,059
MATT: As you dart past, this blur of dark motion
swings towards you, and where it is about to catch

1572
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:29,751
some of the armor, there's a burst of black
feathers that lift behind where the blade struck

1573
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:35,356
through. As you dart up right into the face of
Kevdak, who's like, (strained sound), trying

1574
01:41:35,356 --> 01:41:39,398
desperately to resist the effect of this. Go for
it. Advantage on the attacks.

1575
01:41:39,398 --> 01:41:40,724
LIAM: Okay. Advantage on all these, right right
right.

1576
01:41:40,724 --> 01:41:42,663
LAURA: Oh my god. Ermagerd.

1577
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:51,020
LIAM: Ermagerd. 22 for the first, which hits. Ah,
yeah, they both hit. And 26 for the second. First

1578
01:41:51,020 --> 01:42:07,049
one. Three plus-- oh my god. Three plus-- Eight,
ten, 16, 22, 23, 29, 32. Which is doubled to 64

1579
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:08,802
plus six.

1580
01:42:08,802 --> 01:42:10,785
MATT: Well, 32 plus six, because he takes
half-damage.

1581
01:42:10,785 --> 01:42:19,453
LIAM: Right, well, let's get it up to the top and
then halve it. So 32 to 64 plus six is 72 halved.

1582
01:42:19,453 --> 01:42:22,923
MATT: Right, 72 halved puts you at 36.

1583
01:42:22,923 --> 01:42:33,060
LIAM: That's the first, and then the second one
does two plus six is eight, no, two and,

1584
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,693
da-ba-ba-ba--

1585
01:42:34,693 --> 01:42:37,309
LAURA: Four, right?

1586
01:42:37,309 --> 01:42:39,150
LIAM: That's just the dice is doubled, so four,
it's ten.

1587
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,431
MATT: All right.

1588
01:42:40,431 --> 01:42:42,323
LIAM: And I'd like to use the rest of, well, go
ahead.

1589
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:48,799
MATT: So yeah, so as you rush up, you slam your
dagger square into the side of his body, and as

1590
01:42:48,799 --> 01:42:52,761
you push it inside, you can see his eyes glancing
back down towards you, held in place, his arm

1591
01:42:52,761 --> 01:42:58,946
broken, still dangling from the little elements of
ligaments that keep it shifting there. With the

1592
01:42:58,946 --> 01:43:03,843
impact of the slam, it swings from the sheer force
of the blow. As you push the blade to the hilt and

1593
01:43:03,843 --> 01:43:08,252
even further in, you feel your hands actually push
into the wound itself about an inch, your fingers

1594
01:43:08,252 --> 01:43:14,561
getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the
interior of his body. As you push up inside, you

1595
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:20,596
pull back, pulling the blade around, in your
pommel, and jam it over the top of the shoulder,

1596
01:43:20,596 --> 01:43:26,767
into the side of his body, the muscle flexes from
the tension of the Hold Person spell, managing to

1597
01:43:26,767 --> 01:43:29,527
reduce a portion of the damage, but it left a
pretty serious wound.

1598
01:43:29,527 --> 01:43:35,903
LIAM: Any movement I have left, I want to use to
run up to the other side of the wall that Keyleth

1599
01:43:35,903 --> 01:43:41,718
is on. If I have enough, I'll climb up, if not,
I'll go behind that barrel. But if I, before I go,

1600
01:43:41,718 --> 01:43:46,238
quietly I say to Kevdak, your fate is sealed here
today, my friend.

1601
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:50,744
MATT: Okay. He does not get an attack of
opportunity on you because he is paralyzed, and

1602
01:43:50,744 --> 01:43:54,080
the guy already took one against you so he already
used his reaction, you rush past him. You do not

1603
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:59,405
have enough movement to get to the top, but you do
get to the corner right where the barrel is. Okay?

1604
01:43:59,405 --> 01:44:00,751
LIAM: Yeah.

1605
01:44:00,751 --> 01:44:02,895
MATT: That ends your turn. It's now the archers'
turn.

1606
01:44:02,895 --> 01:44:04,028
LAURA: Oh god.

1607
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:08,401
SAM: Oh god. So much bloodshed.

1608
01:44:08,401 --> 01:44:13,423
TRAVIS: Can we do some recreational drugs or
something? Take the edge off?

1609
01:44:13,423 --> 01:44:15,164
LAURA: We're going to, we're all going to die.

1610
01:44:15,164 --> 01:44:18,864
SAM: All we got to do is get Kevdak and they're
fucking lost.

1611
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:23,164
TALIESIN: I've got a Scrooge McDuck-sized pit of
Xanax at my house I'm just going to dive into.

1612
01:44:23,164 --> 01:44:29,419
LAURA: Once we kill him, his gauntlets are going
to be there, we have to go in and

1613
01:44:29,419 --> 01:44:30,750
get his gauntlets.

1614
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:38,277
SAM: Yeah, that's a point, that's a point made.
You know who could get them, who's fast and

1615
01:44:38,277 --> 01:44:40,361
strong? Trinket.

1616
01:44:40,361 --> 01:44:45,136
MATT: This guy here is going to go ahead, he's out
of range of you, Marisha. Shoving this barrel off

1617
01:44:45,136 --> 01:44:47,425
the side to try and get away from you.

1618
01:44:47,425 --> 01:44:48,692
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity.

1619
01:44:48,692 --> 01:44:51,146
MATT: Marisha, you do get an attack of
opportunity, it does fall and hit the barrel next

1620
01:44:51,146 --> 01:44:55,806
to you, I mean, next to Vax. It doesn't hit you,
but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the

1621
01:44:55,806 --> 01:44:57,701
barrel next to your side and rolls off.

1622
01:44:57,701 --> 01:44:59,118
MARISHA: Rolling terribly.

1623
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:00,499
MATT: What'd you get, Keyleth?

1624
01:45:00,499 --> 01:45:01,502
MARISHA: Ten total.

1625
01:45:01,502 --> 01:45:03,325
MATT: Ten total? Misses.

1626
01:45:03,325 --> 01:45:06,370
MARISHA: Oh no, oh, I had to roll to hit. I'm
sorry, I was rolling damage.

1627
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,708
MATT: What'd you roll?

1628
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:13,661
MARISHA: I didn't roll to hit. To hit, that is,
plus, 16 to hit?

1629
01:45:13,661 --> 01:45:17,355
MATT: 16 versus the archer? 17. Just misses.

1630
01:45:17,355 --> 01:45:20,823
SAM: You really... blew it.

1631
01:45:20,823 --> 01:45:23,064
TALIESIN: To be fair, she's a bit winded.

1632
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:25,737
SAM: Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice.

1633
01:45:25,737 --> 01:45:32,912
MATT: They're both, having now made out the
connection between the mooning and Kevdak holding

1634
01:45:32,912 --> 01:45:37,370
himself in place, they're both trying to take you
out. One of them has disadvantage because you're

1635
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,833
in its spot and it couldn't get away from you, it
had nowhere to go really. So one's taking two

1636
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:45,299
attacks at you, Scanlan. That is going to be, heh,
a 12.

1637
01:45:45,299 --> 01:45:46,430
SAM: Miss.

1638
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:47,896
MATT: And a 26.

1639
01:45:47,896 --> 01:45:48,837
SAM: Hit.

1640
01:45:48,837 --> 01:45:53,486
MATT: The other one's going to have two attacks
with disadvantage against you. That's, even with

1641
01:45:53,486 --> 01:45:54,998
disadvantage, that's a 21.

1642
01:45:54,998 --> 01:45:56,101
SAM: Hit.

1643
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:59,298
MATT: And the other one with disadvantage is a
15.

1644
01:45:59,298 --> 01:46:00,708
SAM: Hit.

1645
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:03,205
LAURA: What? 15 hits you?

1646
01:46:03,205 --> 01:46:05,460
SAM: I am not wearing some things.

1647
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:07,332
MATT: Yeah, it's true. So three attacks hit you.

1648
01:46:07,332 --> 01:46:09,060
SAM: Yeah.

1649
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:17,053
MATT: The first one is going to be, all right.
That's a full ten plus--

1650
01:46:17,053 --> 01:46:19,882
14 points of piercing damage.

1651
01:46:19,882 --> 01:46:21,766
SAM: Okay.

1652
01:46:21,766 --> 01:46:24,991
MATT: Go ahead and roll your concentration.

1653
01:46:24,991 --> 01:46:26,552
SAM: Oh, yeah, that.

1654
01:46:26,552 --> 01:46:28,146
MATT: So roll and add two.

1655
01:46:28,146 --> 01:46:31,190
SAM: Roll and add two, or?

1656
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:32,609
MATT: Because it's plus your constitution.

1657
01:46:32,609 --> 01:46:33,695
SAM: Oh. 19.

1658
01:46:33,695 --> 01:46:39,251
MATT: 19? Okay. The next attack deals five points.
Go ahead and roll again with advantage.

1659
01:46:39,251 --> 01:46:44,396
SAM: 19.

1660
01:46:44,396 --> 01:46:53,064
MATT: Damn. All right. And the third one. Yeah,
what's your constitution saving throw, it's plus

1661
01:46:53,064 --> 01:46:54,079
two, right?

1662
01:46:54,079 --> 01:46:55,107
SAM: Yep.

1663
01:46:55,107 --> 01:46:59,663
MATT: Last one does 11 points of piercing damage
to you. And make another series of checks for

1664
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:01,029
concentration.

1665
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:03,133
SAM: 17.

1666
01:47:03,133 --> 01:47:04,278
MATT: Fine.

1667
01:47:04,278 --> 01:47:06,216
LAURA: We're fine, we're okay, we're okay?

1668
01:47:06,216 --> 01:47:13,959
MATT: That Warcaster feat, man. Okay, that
finishes those two guys. This one here's off to

1669
01:47:13,959 --> 01:47:20,636
the side, this one's going to go ahead and turn
around this way and get around the edge. Actually,

1670
01:47:20,636 --> 01:47:21,925
he's going to--

1671
01:47:21,925 --> 01:47:23,279
LAURA: I'm going to start crying.

1672
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:28,318
MATT: This one over here didn't notice you swing
by over the top, swoosh overhead. It does see

1673
01:47:28,318 --> 01:47:36,359
Percy on the roof that shot it, you do have
partial cover, so. We'll say that's half cover, so

1674
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:48,691
plus two to your AC against this guy's two arrow
shots against you. All righty. That is 26 to hit.

1675
01:47:48,691 --> 01:47:50,146
TALIESIN: Well, that hits.

1676
01:47:50,146 --> 01:47:52,308
MATT: All right. Second strike. Same thing, 26.

1677
01:47:52,308 --> 01:47:53,466
TALIESIN: All right.

1678
01:47:53,466 --> 01:47:54,540
MATT: 18 and 18.

1679
01:47:54,540 --> 01:48:01,195
TALIESIN: 18 and 18? I can use the-- yeah, I only
have one reaction, so. All right.

1680
01:48:01,195 --> 01:48:05,785
MATT: So that's nine points of piercing damage
with the first shot.

1681
01:48:05,785 --> 01:48:06,999
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

1682
01:48:06,999 --> 01:48:08,759
MATT: And 14 points of piercing damage with the
second one.

1683
01:48:08,759 --> 01:48:10,218
TALIESIN: I'll fight that one, I'll contest that.

1684
01:48:10,218 --> 01:48:11,692
SAM: This has been a long fight, guys.

1685
01:48:11,692 --> 01:48:14,041
LIAM: No, this is like 30 seconds later, if that.

1686
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,174
MATT: What are you contesting it with?

1687
01:48:16,174 --> 01:48:19,084
TALIESIN: Gloves of Missile Snaring.

1688
01:48:19,084 --> 01:48:20,695
MATT: How many times can you use that?

1689
01:48:20,695 --> 01:48:25,808
TALIESIN: It's a reaction. It doesn't say, I can
make an attempt to catch.

1690
01:48:25,808 --> 01:48:27,461
MATT: Yeah. So go ahead and make the attempt.

1691
01:48:27,461 --> 01:48:28,719
TALIESIN: That's 14 points?

1692
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,005
MATT: 14 points, yeah.

1693
01:48:30,005 --> 01:48:42,372
TALIESIN: Dexterity modifier, 11, so I can reduce
it to three points of damage. I still got hit, so.

1694
01:48:42,372 --> 01:48:47,811
MATT: So go ahead and mark that. Okay. And this
guy over here at the very top moves over as well

1695
01:48:47,811 --> 01:48:54,616
and is going to go ahead and take two more shots
at Scanlan. Since there's currently not a whole

1696
01:48:54,616 --> 01:49:00,782
lot he can see in the area that's a threat to him,
near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple up on

1697
01:49:00,782 --> 01:49:06,874
the rooftop another friend of his is currently
whaling on, so. Two attacks against you. That's

1698
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,814
going to be a 19.

1699
01:49:09,814 --> 01:49:11,124
SAM: Hit.

1700
01:49:11,124 --> 01:49:12,608
MATT: And 23.

1701
01:49:12,608 --> 01:49:13,738
SAM: Hit.

1702
01:49:13,738 --> 01:49:17,766
MATT: All right. You take another six points of
piercing damage. Go ahead and make your--

1703
01:49:17,766 --> 01:49:19,665
SAM: Yeah, 20.

1704
01:49:19,665 --> 01:49:24,471
MATT: What was it? 20? Okay. Second one is 14
points of piercing damage.

1705
01:49:24,471 --> 01:49:25,788
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus.

1706
01:49:25,788 --> 01:49:31,568
SAM: Six.

1707
01:49:31,568 --> 01:49:38,459
MATT: And with that, the Hold Person fades,
concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from

1708
01:49:38,459 --> 01:49:48,334
the nearby Herd archers. You hear a roar across
the battlefield, (roars). Currently with one

1709
01:49:48,334 --> 01:49:55,094
busted arm, no arm on the other side, Kevdak is
screaming in terrible pain and anger.

1710
01:49:55,094 --> 01:49:56,972
LIAM: But he's great at riverdance.

1711
01:49:56,972 --> 01:49:59,326
(laughter)

1712
01:49:59,326 --> 01:50:04,365
MATT: All right, archers finish their turn. It
comes to Kevdak's turn. He's going to go ahead and

1713
01:50:04,365 --> 01:50:13,248
use his bonus action to go ahead and use Second
Wind. Heals 17 hit points on that, rolled a ten.

1714
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:24,809
He is then going to-- let's see. Huh.

1715
01:50:24,809 --> 01:50:26,400
MARISHA: No one's around him.

1716
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,793
MATT: Yeah, he has no axe. He reaches over and
picks up your hammer.

1717
01:50:28,793 --> 01:50:30,604
TALIESIN: With his broken hand?

1718
01:50:30,604 --> 01:50:33,874
MATT: Oh, yeah, no, actually no, he can't do that
right now.

1719
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:35,458
SAM: With his beak.

1720
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:37,825
LAURA: He kicks the hammer.

1721
01:50:37,825 --> 01:50:40,900
MARISHA: He, yeah. He teabags it.

1722
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,472
TRAVIS: He kills one of his subordinates for
letting him--

1723
01:50:43,472 --> 01:50:49,607
MATT: Yeah, he turns to one of his subordinates to
the side and says, "One of you, pick that up. The

1724
01:50:49,607 --> 01:50:53,894
"rest of you, kill them." And looks over to the
other two innocent that are on the ground right

1725
01:50:53,894 --> 01:50:59,484
now. He then is going to go ahead and start moving
over towards Greenbeard.

1726
01:50:59,484 --> 01:51:00,929
SAM: Because he moves.

1727
01:51:00,929 --> 01:51:02,079
MATT: Yes?

1728
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,552
SAM: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?

1729
01:51:05,552 --> 01:51:06,840
LAURA: Oh, the Spiritual Weapon!

1730
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:13,331
MATT: A Spiritual Weapon is technically not a
creature. It doesn't get a reaction. It's only on

1731
01:51:13,331 --> 01:51:18,664
a bonus action you get a chance to attack with it.
Yeah. He's going to move over here, around the

1732
01:51:18,664 --> 01:51:25,304
flames, up to Greenbeard. Okay. That finishes his
turn, there's not much else he can do at this

1733
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:27,318
point. Scanlan, you're up.

1734
01:51:27,318 --> 01:51:28,827
SAM: Pike, how you doing?

1735
01:51:28,827 --> 01:51:38,421
ASHLEY: I'm at 20. I'm pretty rough. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay. I have an idea to try and

1736
01:51:38,421 --> 01:51:40,327
get out of it if I need to.

1737
01:51:40,327 --> 01:51:41,868
SAM: Kevdak or Pike?

1738
01:51:41,868 --> 01:51:45,345
LAURA: They're all clustered right there. If you
have something that does area.

1739
01:51:45,345 --> 01:51:47,560
SAM: They are, I don't care about them, I just
care about Kevdak.

1740
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,053
LIAM: End the fight, Scanlan.

1741
01:51:49,053 --> 01:51:51,060
LAURA: Well, Greenbeard can probably heal Kevdak.

1742
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:52,125
SAM: All right.

1743
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:54,367
MARISHA: That's probably what he's going over
there for.

1744
01:51:54,367 --> 01:52:01,843
SAM: I don't think I'll be able to do a Fireball
without hitting either Kiki or that innocent.

1745
01:52:01,843 --> 01:52:06,951
MARISHA: I'm fine, I haven't taken any damage.

1746
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:08,341
TALIESIN: She's up 60 bonus hit points.

1747
01:52:08,341 --> 01:52:10,737
MARISHA: No, I'm up 90 bonus hit points and I
haven't taken any damage.

1748
01:52:10,737 --> 01:52:14,865
SAM: All right. I'll do the same thing, then.
Shit.

1749
01:52:14,865 --> 01:52:19,564
MATT: What're you doing, Scanlan?

1750
01:52:19,564 --> 01:52:22,054
SAM: Yep. The Wand of Fireballs again.

1751
01:52:22,054 --> 01:52:23,185
MATT: How many--

1752
01:52:23,185 --> 01:52:26,836
SAM: I have seven charges, I've used three, I'll use
three more.

1753
01:52:26,836 --> 01:52:30,442
MATT: Okay, where, in the center here at Kevdak?

1754
01:52:30,442 --> 01:52:32,502
SAM: Yes, Kevdak is the center square.

1755
01:52:32,502 --> 01:52:34,749
MATT: That would hit that archer.

1756
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:36,426
SAM: Would it hit that innocent?

1757
01:52:36,426 --> 01:52:39,322
MATT: It would hit those innocents there, both of
those innocents.

1758
01:52:39,322 --> 01:52:42,314
SAM: Okay. Angle it a little over towards Kiki so
it doesn't hit the innocent?

1759
01:52:42,314 --> 01:52:45,093
MATT: Yeah, with your angle, you could angle it
this way.

1760
01:52:45,093 --> 01:52:46,901
SAM: Oh, would it hit Vax that way?

1761
01:52:46,901 --> 01:52:48,046
MATT: Yeah, it would.

1762
01:52:48,046 --> 01:52:49,353
LIAM: It's all right. Do it.

1763
01:52:49,353 --> 01:52:50,604
SAM: Okay, I'll kill the innocent.

1764
01:52:50,604 --> 01:52:51,547
LIAM: Do it!

1765
01:52:51,547 --> 01:52:53,475
SAM: I'll kill the innocent.

1766
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:57,589
LIAM: I can dodge that shit! I can dodge that
shit!

1767
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:59,753
LAURA: Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents!

1768
01:52:59,753 --> 01:53:01,314
SAM: I said it already, it's too late.

1769
01:53:01,314 --> 01:53:05,515
MATT: Yep. So Scanlan fires the Fireball at
Kevdak, it detonates.

1770
01:53:05,515 --> 01:53:07,556
LIAM: I could've avoided it completely.

1771
01:53:07,556 --> 01:53:11,909
SAM: Okay. Yes. Do I just roll? 10d8.

1772
01:53:11,909 --> 01:53:13,777
TALIESIN: 10d6.

1773
01:53:13,777 --> 01:53:15,331
SAM: Six. Six, yes.

1774
01:53:15,331 --> 01:53:21,190
MATT: Kevdak, save for that, yeah, he makes his
save.

1775
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:23,001
MARISHA: Gah, fucking fucker.

1776
01:53:23,001 --> 01:53:27,261
MATT: Because it's DC 15. Greenbeard also makes
his save.

1777
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:29,278
SAM: 42.

1778
01:53:29,278 --> 01:53:40,562
MATT: 42. Damn. (counting) Ten. So Kevdak takes
ten points of fire damage.

1779
01:53:40,562 --> 01:53:43,840
SAM: Ten? He made his save.

1780
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,427
MATT: Because he made his save for half damage,
and then he takes half that from his rage.

1781
01:53:47,427 --> 01:53:55,370
Greenbeard takes 21. He's looking rough,
Greenbeard is now burned and (grunts) is looking a

1782
01:53:55,370 --> 01:54:02,898
bit frenzied at this point. The archer does make
the save, high dex, they take 21 points on him.

1783
01:54:02,898 --> 01:54:06,465
SAM: (belches) Pardon me.

1784
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:17,406
MATT: This archer there also makes it. However,
that one's taken-- no, that one hasn't taken a lot

1785
01:54:17,406 --> 01:54:25,694
of damage, it was that one over there. This one
here does also make his save.

1786
01:54:25,694 --> 01:54:28,552
SAM: Ah, Jesus. These guys are unkillable.

1787
01:54:28,552 --> 01:54:30,250
MARISHA: They all made their saves.

1788
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,743
LAURA: Surprise attack would've been really good
on these guys.

1789
01:54:32,743 --> 01:54:40,604
MATT: That guy there does make his save, they're
all rolling 15 or above on this.

1790
01:54:40,604 --> 01:54:41,972
LAURA: God.

1791
01:54:41,972 --> 01:54:47,758
MATT: This guy here rolls a natural 20 on his
save.

1792
01:54:47,758 --> 01:54:49,545
LAURA: Fuck all of them!

1793
01:54:49,545 --> 01:54:53,126
MATT: Well, that was the innocent there.

1794
01:54:53,185 --> 01:54:55,170
ALL: Oh.

1795
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:56,386
MARISHA: Good job, guy.

1796
01:54:56,386 --> 01:54:58,508
MATT: It's still 21 points of damage for a
peasant, he is incinerated and you hear the

1797
01:54:58,508 --> 01:55:00,773
horrible scream of pain as--

1798
01:55:00,773 --> 01:55:02,764
SAM: Hey, we killed something, guys!

1799
01:55:02,764 --> 01:55:04,864
LAURA: That was the first thing we killed in this
fight.

1800
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:06,755
MATT: First thing you killed in this fight was an
innocent villager.

1801
01:55:06,755 --> 01:55:08,698
LAURA: That is terrible.

1802
01:55:08,698 --> 01:55:12,298
MATT: And with that scream that echoes in the back
of your mind, knowing the decision you made, a

1803
01:55:12,298 --> 01:55:17,827
little part of your heart sinks in your chest.
However, Keyleth, I need you to go ahead and make

1804
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:19,343
a dexterity save as well.

1805
01:55:19,343 --> 01:55:22,075
MARISHA: Yeah. On it. Natural 19.

1806
01:55:22,075 --> 01:55:23,967
MATT: All right, so you take 21 points of fire
damage.

1807
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:28,338
SAM: Even though I can't see her--

1808
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:37,430
MATT: And actually, that guy technically would
be-- yeah, that innocent there would also be in

1809
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:41,610
range. He doesn't make his save, he is also
incinerated. Both of them burn.

1810
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:45,904
MARISHA: Whoops.

1811
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,637
LAURA: Two peasants dead.

1812
01:55:47,637 --> 01:55:49,066
SAM: Sorry.

1813
01:55:49,066 --> 01:55:51,447
MATT: All right. So.

1814
01:55:51,447 --> 01:55:58,288
SAM: Even though I can't see her, I'm so connected
to her, can I try to heal Pike with a big shout?

1815
01:55:58,288 --> 01:56:02,902
MATT: As a Healing Word spell? A creature you can
see within range, so no, you have to be able to

1816
01:56:02,902 --> 01:56:04,374
see her to aid her.

1817
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:05,511
SAM: Okay.

1818
01:56:05,511 --> 01:56:08,890
MATT: Which you could do if you wanted to risk
it.

1819
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:12,301
SAM: I don't know if I want to move, this guy is
on me.

1820
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:14,620
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you're also getting pummeled
by arrows.

1821
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:16,012
LAURA: That's true.

1822
01:56:16,012 --> 01:56:18,576
TALIESIN: So maybe standing there is not
necessarily the--

1823
01:56:18,576 --> 01:56:21,223
LAURA: Like, up and over would probably be
better.

1824
01:56:21,223 --> 01:56:23,393
SAM: He's going to take a whack at me.

1825
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:25,796
TALIESIN: He's going to take a whack at you
in a minute anyway.

1826
01:56:25,796 --> 01:56:27,194
LIAM: Can't you stay alongside him the whole
time?

1827
01:56:27,194 --> 01:56:29,965
LAURA: Yeah. If you're within five feet of him, he
doesn't attack.

1828
01:56:29,965 --> 01:56:31,018
LIAM: Just circle him.

1829
01:56:31,018 --> 01:56:34,558
SAM: Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even
really see where I am, but. Yeah.

1830
01:56:34,558 --> 01:56:37,301
LIAM: Just going around him. Kitty-corner.

1831
01:56:37,301 --> 01:56:39,571
MATT: So yeah, you get over this side here.

1832
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:40,902
LIAM: Oh, he's dead.

1833
01:56:40,902 --> 01:56:42,415
LAURA: (laughs) Every time.

1834
01:56:42,415 --> 01:56:48,370
MATT: All right, so you move around him. And you
see Pike now surrounded by a number of the

1835
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:49,544
barbarians.

1836
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:50,936
LAURA: Oh no!

1837
01:56:50,936 --> 01:56:52,428
MATT: You can use your bonus action to heal her if
you'd like.

1838
01:56:52,428 --> 01:56:54,194
SAM: You have some plan or something, right?

1839
01:56:54,194 --> 01:56:56,869
ASHLEY: I mean, who the fuck knows if that's going
to fucking work?

1840
01:56:56,869 --> 01:57:03,490
SAM: My healing is barely anything. So
I'll inspire you instead, I think.

1841
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:05,226
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll take it, I'll take it.

1842
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:06,503
MATT: How do you inspire her?

1843
01:57:06,503 --> 01:57:16,892
SAM: I sing, (singing) Well then I saw her mace,
now I'm a believer, without a trace, of blood in

1844
01:57:16,892 --> 01:57:20,152
her hair. I'm in love.

1845
01:57:20,152 --> 01:57:22,267
ALL: (singing) Ooh-ahh.

1846
01:57:22,267 --> 01:57:24,198
SAM: (singing) I'm a believer.

1847
01:57:24,198 --> 01:57:25,454
MATT: (singing) Take your d10.

1848
01:57:25,454 --> 01:57:28,228
ASHLEY: (singing) I'll take my d10, use it later.

1849
01:57:28,228 --> 01:57:33,561
MATT: Ends Scanlan's turn. That's the end of your
turn. Grog, you are sealed. You have no turn.

1850
01:57:33,561 --> 01:57:37,784
LAURA: Sorry, Grog. I was trying to keep you from
dying.

1851
01:57:37,784 --> 01:57:43,827
MATT: Brings us to Greenbeard, who's in a rough
place right now. Greenbeard is going to go ahead

1852
01:57:43,827 --> 01:57:46,462
and finally do something.

1853
01:57:46,462 --> 01:57:51,308
SAM: God dammit, he's going to heal fucking
Kevdak. It's a new round.

1854
01:57:51,308 --> 01:57:57,555
MATT: "Kevdak. Protect the Herd." And he reaches
forward and touches him.

1855
01:57:57,555 --> 01:57:59,662
ASHLEY: Fuck that guy.

1856
01:57:59,662 --> 01:58:03,502
SAM: Yeah, I'll counterspell that too.

1857
01:58:03,502 --> 01:58:06,873
MATT: As he's right there. That's Heal.

1858
01:58:06,873 --> 01:58:10,315
MARISHA: No, I knew it, I knew it, it's going to
heal him for all of his hit points.

1859
01:58:10,315 --> 01:58:11,812
SAM: I'm counterspelling.

1860
01:58:11,812 --> 01:58:18,097
MATT: Okay, so that's a 6th-level. Go ahead and
roll, add seven, and you have to get 16 or higher.

1861
01:58:18,097 --> 01:58:20,577
SAM: Can I cast it at a higher level?

1862
01:58:20,577 --> 01:58:22,219
MARISHA: Heal is a 7th-level spell.

1863
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:24,046
MATT: What level are you casting Counterspell at?

1864
01:58:24,046 --> 01:58:28,704
SAM: Do I know what this spell is?

1865
01:58:28,704 --> 01:58:33,224
MATT: No, Heal, 70. Old version was almost all
your hit points.

1866
01:58:33,224 --> 01:58:36,471
SAM: Fifth level.

1867
01:58:36,471 --> 01:58:43,896
MATT: At fifth level? All right, so you're casting
it at fifth level. Counterspell, mark that off.

1868
01:58:43,896 --> 01:58:49,971
Less than or equal to the level of the spell slot
you use. So it is fifth level, doesn't do

1869
01:58:49,971 --> 01:58:57,227
anything. Because what fifth level does is it
increases the equal level of the spell to cancel.

1870
01:58:57,227 --> 01:59:02,857
Fifth level, it's a 6th-level spell, so now you
just roll. So now roll. Add seven. You're trying

1871
01:59:02,857 --> 01:59:04,609
to get 16 or higher.

1872
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:05,954
LAURA: No!

1873
01:59:05,954 --> 01:59:07,382
ASHLEY: What is it, what is it, what is it?

1874
01:59:07,382 --> 01:59:11,225
SAM: It was a three. But I get advantage.

1875
01:59:11,225 --> 01:59:12,845
MATT: No.

1876
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:14,514
SAM: Because I'm wearing this.

1877
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:20,548
MATT: With that, Greenbeard reaches out and
touches Kevdak. Kevdak roars in pain as all of a

1878
01:59:20,548 --> 01:59:27,463
sudden the muscles and tendons in his arm reform
and in his still-wounded but now-functional arm,

1879
01:59:27,463 --> 01:59:32,465
he crushes the gauntlet in his hand. "Bring me the
other!"

1880
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:33,929
LAURA: Shit.

1881
01:59:33,929 --> 01:59:36,915
MATT: And you see the other one who was over there
reach for the gauntlet.

1882
01:59:36,915 --> 01:59:39,014
MARISHA: God dammit, I was about to handle that. I
was about to handle that!

1883
01:59:39,014 --> 01:59:40,679
Who's bringing him the gauntlet?

1884
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:46,367
MATT: Greenbeard is now going to go ahead and back
behind here, trying to get behind the tree as he

1885
01:59:46,367 --> 01:59:48,040
now notices he's in the open.

1886
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,201
LIAM: Burn him up.

1887
01:59:49,201 --> 01:59:53,524
MATT: Done his business in that moment. No, as a
bonus action, he's going to go ahead and turn into

1888
01:59:53,524 --> 01:59:55,046
an earth elemental.

1889
01:59:55,046 --> 01:59:56,087
MARISHA: Who is?

1890
01:59:56,087 --> 01:59:57,048
LAURA: Greenbeard.

1891
01:59:57,048 --> 01:59:59,155
MARISHA: Fucking druids! Fucking druids!

1892
01:59:59,155 --> 02:00:01,145
ASHLEY: Kill him! Kill him, Keyleth.

1893
02:00:01,145 --> 02:00:02,146
MATT: All right.

1894
02:00:02,146 --> 02:00:03,414
LIAM: Everything just flipped.

1895
02:00:03,414 --> 02:00:05,992
MATT: Now. Percy, you're up.

1896
02:00:05,992 --> 02:00:07,853
SAM: Kill Kevdak.

1897
02:00:07,853 --> 02:00:14,059
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I can't kill Kevdak,
he just healed for--

1898
02:00:14,059 --> 02:00:16,037
MATT: Kevdak was on the cusp.

1899
02:00:16,037 --> 02:00:19,189
ASHLEY: But now he has 70 extra hit points.

1900
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:20,365
MATT: He does.

1901
02:00:20,365 --> 02:00:26,986
LAURA: He heals 70 extra hit points? Oh, not 70
percent of his hit points? We can still take him,

1902
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:28,205
we can still take him.

1903
02:00:28,205 --> 02:00:29,373
TALIESIN: Oh, seven hit points.

1904
02:00:29,373 --> 02:00:30,543
ALL: 70.

1905
02:00:30,543 --> 02:00:33,196
TRAVIS: 140. We have to hit him for 140.

1906
02:00:33,196 --> 02:00:34,825
TALIESIN: He healed him 70 hit points. Is he still
raging, though?

1907
02:00:34,825 --> 02:00:39,423
MATT: Yeah. He continues to rage if he's taken
damage since the last round. He's taken a lot of

1908
02:00:39,423 --> 02:00:40,580
damage.

1909
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:45,000
MARISHA: We've got to get those fucking
gauntlets.

1910
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,730
LAURA: Don't let him get the gauntlets, Percy!

1911
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:51,810
MARISHA: Where's the gauntlet, can we see the
gauntlet on the battlefield?

1912
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:54,010
MATT: It's over here right now, it's on the
ground.

1913
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:55,730
LIAM: He told somebody to pick it up, but they
didn't do it yet.

1914
02:00:55,730 --> 02:01:07,042
TALIESIN: Okay. No, I can't do that, can I? I look
at the guy next to me, I'm going to take a look--

1915
02:01:07,042 --> 02:01:14,377
oh god. I'm going to take a running jump off the
front of the house.

1916
02:01:14,377 --> 02:01:15,511
SAM: Oh my god.

1917
02:01:15,511 --> 02:01:16,859
TALIESIN: Straight into the--

1918
02:01:16,859 --> 02:01:20,706
LAURA: In the kill box, you're going into the kill
box?

1919
02:01:20,706 --> 02:01:22,470
SAM: You're not fast, you're not a fast person!

1920
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:24,560
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to jump for the other
house.

1921
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,739
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an acrobatics
check. Oh right, this is a jump, so this would be

1922
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:28,677
athletics.

1923
02:01:28,677 --> 02:01:31,947
TALIESIN: Is it not an acrobatics, I can't do an
acrobatics, I can't parkour this? My hands are free.

1924
02:01:31,947 --> 02:01:36,363
MATT: I'll say you can make an acrobatics with
disadvantage or an athletics with a single roll.

1925
02:01:36,363 --> 02:01:40,829
Since this is actually the strength of the run,
it's not a big distance, so it's not a huge DC for

1926
02:01:40,829 --> 02:01:42,849
a jump, but it's your call. What do you want to
do?

1927
02:01:42,849 --> 02:01:48,441
TALIESIN: I'll take an athletics. What do you
think, athletics or? Oh, no no. I'll acrobatics it

1928
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:49,496
with disadvantage.

1929
02:01:49,496 --> 02:01:51,069
MATT: All right. Go for it.

1930
02:01:51,069 --> 02:01:53,723
TALIESIN: Yeah, I. Yeah, no.

1931
02:01:53,723 --> 02:01:54,987
MATT: What'd you roll?

1932
02:01:54,987 --> 02:01:56,773
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

1933
02:01:56,773 --> 02:02:05,594
MATT: You rolled a one? So, as you leap off the
side, your foot hits the edge of the tile, and the

1934
02:02:05,594 --> 02:02:12,094
blade behind you swings. Which I believe is going
to hit you with a 20. Is that your AC?

1935
02:02:12,094 --> 02:02:13,308
TALIESIN: My AC's 18.

1936
02:02:13,308 --> 02:02:17,609
MATT: 18, yeah. You take seven plus four, 11
points of slashing damage.

1937
02:02:17,609 --> 02:02:18,892
TALIESIN: I'm fine with that.

1938
02:02:18,892 --> 02:02:22,247
MATT: The blow, however, is just enough to throw
you off-kilter, and you go plummeting down into

1939
02:02:22,247 --> 02:02:23,390
the alleyway.

1940
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:24,400
TALIESIN: Okay.

1941
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,820
MATT: Falling prone. You can use your movement to
get back up, the remainder of your movement, but

1942
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:31,657
you can't move from there. The fall does deal an
additional five points of bludgeoning damage.

1943
02:02:31,657 --> 02:02:32,781
TALIESIN: Don't care.

1944
02:02:32,781 --> 02:02:40,080
MATT: All right, so you get back up-- You're now
in this alleyway right here facing this line here

1945
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,832
is all you can really see from your perspective.

1946
02:02:41,832 --> 02:02:43,121
TALIESIN: Who can I see from my perspective?

1947
02:02:43,121 --> 02:02:47,888
MATT: You can see Vax, you can see Kevdak, and you
can see this dude here, and an archer, but has

1948
02:02:47,888 --> 02:02:49,397
partial cover because of the--

1949
02:02:49,397 --> 02:02:56,224
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to, as a bonus action
I'm going to do a quick heal.

1950
02:02:56,224 --> 02:02:58,193
MATT: Okay. Second Wind?

1951
02:02:58,193 --> 02:03:07,823
TALIESIN: Second Wind. Just to make that go away.
God, that's amazing. 18 back, so, I've got--

1952
02:03:07,823 --> 02:03:09,666
MATT: Second Wind, man.

1953
02:03:09,666 --> 02:03:19,355
TALIESIN: And: ow! I'm going to pull out the big
gun and I'm going to take a nice heavy serious

1954
02:03:19,355 --> 02:03:31,066
look at Kevdak. What am I going to hit him with?
I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face.

1955
02:03:31,066 --> 02:03:34,051
I'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun.

1956
02:03:34,051 --> 02:03:36,533
MATT: A headshot? With the big gun?

1957
02:03:36,533 --> 02:03:38,350
TALIESIN: A headshot. With the big, with
sharpshooter.

1958
02:03:38,350 --> 02:03:39,982
MATT: Right, so you're using the trickshot on
him.

1959
02:03:39,982 --> 02:03:51,559
TALIESIN: Trickshot on sharpshooter. I'm doing a
combo. 23 to hit.

1960
02:03:51,559 --> 02:03:53,045
MATT: That hits.

1961
02:03:53,045 --> 02:03:55,583
TALIESIN: I don't feel good.

1962
02:03:55,583 --> 02:03:59,109
TRAVIS: I have the worst headache right now.

1963
02:03:59,109 --> 02:04:03,188
TALIESIN: I feel really bad right now. I don't
feel happy.

1964
02:04:03,188 --> 02:04:07,739
All right, so that's-- first the
damage.

1965
02:04:07,739 --> 02:04:09,366
MATT: All right.

1966
02:04:09,366 --> 02:04:15,301
TALIESIN: That's 26 points of piercing damage.

1967
02:04:15,301 --> 02:04:18,904
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage, reduced to
half, 13.

1968
02:04:18,904 --> 02:04:26,222
TALIESIN: Plus he has to make a constitution
saving throw against a DC of 19.

1969
02:04:26,222 --> 02:04:31,290
MATT: Constitution, yeah, that's a 23.

1970
02:04:31,290 --> 02:04:34,743
LAURA: Wait, what?

1971
02:04:34,743 --> 02:04:37,451
MARISHA: He just made his constitution save.

1972
02:04:37,451 --> 02:04:40,535
MATT: He's got a high constitution, saving throws,
it's kind of his thing.

1973
02:04:40,535 --> 02:04:43,616
TALIESIN: Reloading, taking another shot. I don't
care, I don't care.

1974
02:04:43,616 --> 02:04:45,434
MATT: Same thing, sharpshooter?

1975
02:04:45,434 --> 02:04:50,078
TALIESIN: Same thing, sharpshooter, I'm going
to--

1976
02:04:50,078 --> 02:04:58,745
MATT: Any other trickshots you're going to use,
or? Deadshot, anything you want to use?

1977
02:04:58,745 --> 02:05:00,827
LAURA: This is heroic death music right now.

1978
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:02,529
TALIESIN: I hate this music you're playing.

1979
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:03,749
MATT: I could switch it up, if you want.

1980
02:05:03,749 --> 02:05:04,834
TALIESIN: No no.

1981
02:05:04,834 --> 02:05:06,185
LIAM: Benny Hill?

1982
02:05:06,185 --> 02:05:09,473
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop a grit for advantage,
because--

1983
02:05:09,473 --> 02:05:11,623
MATT: Okay, for deadeye shot?

1984
02:05:11,623 --> 02:05:12,944
TALIESIN: Deadeye with sharpshooter.

1985
02:05:12,944 --> 02:05:14,246
MATT: Go for it.

1986
02:05:14,246 --> 02:05:25,510
TALIESIN: That's good. It can only go up from
there. And we do, all right. That's 19, 26 to hit,

1987
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:26,434
that hits.

1988
02:05:26,434 --> 02:05:27,594
MATT: With the minus five?

1989
02:05:27,594 --> 02:05:30,227
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, that's with the minus
five, how about that, I rolled a 19.

1990
02:05:30,227 --> 02:05:31,874
MATT: Yeah. Great, yeah, so go ahead and roll
damage on that.

1991
02:05:31,874 --> 02:05:35,676
TALIESIN: Asshole, asshole, that's better.

1992
02:05:35,676 --> 02:05:38,310
LAURA: (laughs) He's saying 'asshole, asshole,
asshole'.

1993
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:47,932
TALIESIN: That is a seven. So that's 17, 18, 19,
20. 30. 36 points of damage.

1994
02:05:47,932 --> 02:05:49,801
MATT: 36 halved to 18.

1995
02:05:49,801 --> 02:05:56,890
TALIESIN: 18. And that's my two shots so I'm not
reloaded.

1996
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:59,904
MATT: That's your three attacks. Shot, reloaded,
shot.

1997
02:05:59,904 --> 02:06:10,478
TALIESIN: Shot, reloaded, shot. I'm now going to
burn my action surge.

1998
02:06:10,478 --> 02:06:12,413
MATT: Okay, angry Percy's angry.

1999
02:06:12,413 --> 02:06:19,020
TALIESIN: Can I-- I was going to say, can I burn
that as a run or can I only burn that as an attack?

2000
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:25,857
MATT: As part of the function, it's like-- You can
use your action as a dash, so you could.

2001
02:06:25,857 --> 02:06:33,776
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action as a dash to,
oh fuck, there's no way around, is there? Fuck it,

2002
02:06:33,776 --> 02:06:35,882
then, I'm taking another shot.

2003
02:06:35,882 --> 02:06:46,494
MATT: All right, so your fourth attack is a
reload, fifth is an attack. Go for it. Is this

2004
02:06:46,494 --> 02:06:48,195
deadeye as well or just regular?

2005
02:06:48,195 --> 02:06:52,054
TALIESIN: This is sharpshooter as well, no
deadeye.

2006
02:06:52,054 --> 02:06:53,897
MATT: Okay, sharpshooter, go for the shot.

2007
02:06:53,897 --> 02:06:59,149
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

2008
02:06:59,149 --> 02:07:01,068
MATT: 23 hits.

2009
02:07:01,068 --> 02:07:05,025
TALIESIN: I want to save some grit for some
problems. (raspberry)

2010
02:07:05,025 --> 02:07:06,561
SAM: That's not bad.

2011
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:07,806
TALIESIN: Yeah it is.

2012
02:07:07,806 --> 02:07:09,174
MARISHA: Wait. Did you roll that?

2013
02:07:09,174 --> 02:07:15,140
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, yeah, thank you! That's the
wrong one. Oh, that's so much better.

2014
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:17,423
MATT: Hah, you rolled a 20-sider instead of a 12?

2015
02:07:17,423 --> 02:07:18,962
TALIESIN: I can't count, my brain.

2016
02:07:18,962 --> 02:07:22,189
LAURA: We're all breaking.

2017
02:07:22,189 --> 02:07:24,180
MARISHA: I know, we're breaking under pressure.

2018
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:28,849
TALIESIN: 32 points of damage? 32 points of
damage.

2019
02:07:28,849 --> 02:07:30,796
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage, all right.

2020
02:07:30,796 --> 02:07:31,957
TALIESIN: And a reload.

2021
02:07:31,957 --> 02:07:44,726
MATT: And a reload. That's your turn. Percy is
done, dealing a grand total of 47 points of damage

2022
02:07:44,726 --> 02:07:45,924
in that round.

2023
02:07:45,924 --> 02:07:47,309
(cheering)

2024
02:07:47,309 --> 02:07:48,743
LAURA: That's good!

2025
02:07:48,743 --> 02:07:51,623
SAM: And I did ten, so we're almost back to where
we were.

2026
02:07:51,623 --> 02:07:59,653
MARISHA: Okay, angry at the fact that I'm not doing
much, I'm going to slowly, for flavor, my air

2027
02:07:59,653 --> 02:08:03,198
elemental's going to start burning a little fire,
I'm going to drop my air elemental and I'm going

2028
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:04,823
to do Firestorm.

2029
02:08:04,823 --> 02:08:07,789
MATT: Okay, Ryan, I need the mini-box that was not
brought.

2030
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:09,449
ASHLEY: (singing) Mini-box.

2031
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:15,072
LIAM: Borrow the Thordak mini.

2032
02:08:15,072 --> 02:08:24,617
LAURA: What if we all die and the dragons take
over everything?

2033
02:08:24,617 --> 02:08:26,182
LIAM: No. No.

2034
02:08:26,182 --> 02:08:30,383
SAM: You know, it's this kind of intense fun that
you can get in every Loot Crate.

2035
02:08:30,383 --> 02:08:33,327
(laughter)

2036
02:08:33,327 --> 02:08:34,663
MATT: Dammit, Sam.

2037
02:08:34,663 --> 02:08:38,989
SAM: Every month, you'll be on pins and needles to
see what's in this box.

2038
02:08:38,989 --> 02:08:46,483
MATT: All right, for the time being, I'll use this
one here. All right, so Keyleth, you revert back.

2039
02:08:46,483 --> 02:08:47,904
MARISHA: I revert back.

2040
02:08:47,904 --> 02:08:49,703
MATT: We'll use this barmaid for the time being.

2041
02:08:49,703 --> 02:08:51,035
LAURA: You're a barmaid.

2042
02:08:51,035 --> 02:08:52,416
MARISHA: Aw, I've been demoted.

2043
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:54,737
LIAM: Beers for everybody.

2044
02:08:54,737 --> 02:08:57,225
TALIESIN: We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair.

2045
02:08:57,225 --> 02:09:00,326
MARISHA: This is alternate timeline version.

2046
02:09:00,326 --> 02:09:02,950
MATT: All right, so, Keyleth, what are you doing?
You dropped form.

2047
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:06,184
MARISHA: I drop form and I'm going to Firestorm
all up in this bitch.

2048
02:09:06,184 --> 02:09:10,966
MATT: Oh, shit. All right. What are you
firestorming, where, what are you doing?

2049
02:09:10,966 --> 02:09:17,882
MARISHA: Seventh level, so it's ten
ten-square-feet. So let's do like--

2050
02:09:17,882 --> 02:09:20,546
MATT: Ten ten-foot cubes.

2051
02:09:20,546 --> 02:09:22,060
MARISHA: Ten ten-foot cubes.

2052
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:27,625
SAM: Jesus. Well see, those peasants would've died
anyway, it's not me, it's her, she did it.

2053
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:29,825
MARISHA: I could've gone around them.

2054
02:09:29,825 --> 02:09:33,136
MATT: So how do you want to arrange this here?

2055
02:09:33,136 --> 02:09:37,138
MARISHA: So let's start, can I do ten including
this archer, ten?

2056
02:09:37,138 --> 02:09:43,752
MATT: You can do there, which would burst off the
corner, it would hit Kevdak, the archer, and

2057
02:09:43,752 --> 02:09:45,085
Greenbeard.

2058
02:09:45,085 --> 02:09:46,545
LIAM: Set that tree on fire.

2059
02:09:46,545 --> 02:09:54,267
MARISHA: Actually, as part of the spell I can
choose to not set the tree on fire. So I choose to

2060
02:09:54,267 --> 02:09:55,650
spare the tree.

2061
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:57,248
MATT: All right, the tree is spared.

2062
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,800
MARISHA: All plant life is spared.

2063
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,974
TALIESIN: Vegan. Sorry.

2064
02:10:00,974 --> 02:10:06,356
MARISHA: I am not a vegan. From there-- is that a
guy, who's that, who's that?

2065
02:10:06,356 --> 02:10:07,874
SAM: They're all baddies.

2066
02:10:07,874 --> 02:10:10,374
LAURA: Everything's bad unless they've got a red
ring around them.

2067
02:10:10,374 --> 02:10:11,654
ASHLEY: Kill 'em, baby, kill 'em.

2068
02:10:11,654 --> 02:10:12,941
LIAM: C'mon, Red!

2069
02:10:12,941 --> 02:10:15,871
LAURA and ASHLEY: C'mon, Kiki!

2070
02:10:15,871 --> 02:10:18,419
MARISHA: Another one there.

2071
02:10:18,419 --> 02:10:26,753
MATT: Okay, so we have there. There. You'd be able
to get one that wouldn't actually hit any of them.

2072
02:10:26,753 --> 02:10:36,632
MARISHA: That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And
then let's go. Can I go four, and then--

2073
02:10:36,632 --> 02:10:42,080
MATT: Six, seven, and that's about all you can
get.

2074
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:50,273
MARISHA: And that got all of these guys? And then
can I go eight, nine, get this guy--

2075
02:10:50,273 --> 02:11:04,884
MATT: Eight, nine, ten, it wouldn't be able to get
that far over. I mean, you could-- (counting).

2076
02:11:04,884 --> 02:11:06,463
MARISHA: And get all of 'em?

2077
02:11:06,463 --> 02:11:11,393
MATT: You could probably get this section there,
yeah. Because they're all pretty clustered, just barely.

2078
02:11:11,393 --> 02:11:12,594
MARISHA: Okay.

2079
02:11:12,594 --> 02:11:16,035
SAM: And you're doing an "S", which is cool.

2080
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:17,566
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that, Keyleth.

2081
02:11:17,566 --> 02:11:18,711
MARISHA: Zorro!

2082
02:11:18,711 --> 02:11:19,991
LAURA: Sorro!

2083
02:11:19,991 --> 02:11:22,084
MARISHA: Okay, ten-- Sorro! Sorry.

2084
02:11:22,084 --> 02:11:28,008
LAURA: What are you rolling, what is the damage?

2085
02:11:28,008 --> 02:11:33,265
MARISHA: 10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait.
Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is.

2086
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:35,273
LAURA: That's a lot. All tens.

2087
02:11:35,273 --> 02:11:41,711
MATT: I'd say you'd be able to get this guy, this
guy you wouldn't be able to, but all the rest of

2088
02:11:41,711 --> 02:11:43,521
these you could. As long as you get over there.

2089
02:11:43,521 --> 02:11:45,455
MARISHA: 7d10. Okay. 7d10.

2090
02:11:45,455 --> 02:11:47,236
MATT: 7d10. Dexterity saving throws, correct,
against your spell DC?

2091
02:11:47,236 --> 02:11:56,793
MARISHA: Uh-huh, which my spell DC is 19. Eight.

2092
02:11:56,793 --> 02:11:58,200
SAM: Oh, some of those are good.

2093
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:10,258
MARISHA: Some of those are good. Plus six, so
that's 14, 16, 18, 19. Another nine, around

2094
02:12:10,258 --> 02:12:11,422
another-- 29.

2095
02:12:11,422 --> 02:12:13,735
MATT: 29 total points of fire damage?

2096
02:12:13,735 --> 02:12:15,112
MARISHA: 29 total points of fire damage.

2097
02:12:15,112 --> 02:12:25,920
MATT: Hm. Okay. Kevdak takes-- he failed his save,
but he takes half that, so 14 points of fire damage.

2098
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,387
SAM: He's back to where he was before the Heal.

2099
02:12:29,387 --> 02:12:35,425
MATT: Yep. Greenbeard takes the full. 29.

2100
02:12:35,425 --> 02:12:38,772
LAURA: But now he's a tank. Greenbeard's an earth
elemental.

2101
02:12:38,772 --> 02:12:43,582
MATT: Yeah, Greenbeard's taking earth elemental
damage now. That archer, that archer burns up,

2102
02:12:43,582 --> 02:12:46,558
archer screams in pain as it incinerates from the
Firestorm.

2103
02:12:46,558 --> 02:12:47,943
SAM: Wait, somebody died?

2104
02:12:47,943 --> 02:12:49,108
LAURA: An archer died!

2105
02:12:49,108 --> 02:12:50,530
SAM: Oh, thank god.

2106
02:12:50,530 --> 02:13:02,299
MATT: That bladestorm there takes 29 damage. That
guy there, they all take 29 damage. That druid fails.

2107
02:13:02,299 --> 02:13:06,401
TALIESIN: Are they on fire now too?

2108
02:13:06,401 --> 02:13:09,494
LAURA: They're all burning to death slowly.

2109
02:13:09,494 --> 02:13:20,748
MATT: 29 damage there. That druid and the rest of
them, fail, success, fail with a one, fail. Fail

2110
02:13:20,748 --> 02:13:25,071
with another one. Okay, so 29, all righty.

2111
02:13:25,071 --> 02:13:30,535
LIAM: While the entire square sets on fire, Vax
quietly and quickly falls a little deeper.

2112
02:13:30,535 --> 02:13:33,799
ASHLEY: Falls a little deeper in what?

2113
02:13:33,799 --> 02:13:35,066
LIAM: In love.

2114
02:13:35,066 --> 02:13:37,954
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh. Aww!

2115
02:13:37,954 --> 02:13:40,882
MATT: All right, cool. All righty.

2116
02:13:40,882 --> 02:13:43,318
MARISHA: I light Vax's fire in the meantime.

2117
02:13:43,318 --> 02:13:45,985
MATT: So. That finishes your turn with a
Firestorm?

2118
02:13:45,985 --> 02:13:51,461
MARISHA: No it does not, I'm going to use a bonus
action to do Grasping Vine.

2119
02:13:51,461 --> 02:13:55,373
MATT: Too high-level, you can't do it, Grasping
Vine's a 4th-level spell. You can only do up to a

2120
02:13:55,373 --> 02:13:57,629
second level as a bonus.

2121
02:13:57,629 --> 02:13:59,696
SAM: Can you use your bonus action to heal?

2122
02:13:59,696 --> 02:14:05,373
MARISHA: I could do a bonus action to heal
somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike?

2123
02:14:05,373 --> 02:14:08,523
MATT: You can't see Pike right now, Pike is out of
the room.

2124
02:14:08,523 --> 02:14:11,098
LAURA: Can you see me up in the air?

2125
02:14:11,098 --> 02:14:12,716
MARISHA: Are you rough? Have you taken some
damage?

2126
02:14:12,716 --> 02:14:14,521
LAURA: Can you see me in the air?

2127
02:14:14,521 --> 02:14:17,247
MARISHA: Can I see Vex flying off into the
distance?

2128
02:14:17,247 --> 02:14:19,827
MATT: Currently, roll a perception check.

2129
02:14:19,827 --> 02:14:24,436
MARISHA: Not great, 14.

2130
02:14:24,436 --> 02:14:27,657
MATT: Nope. You do not see Vex, you have no idea
where she is right now, you just saw her.

2131
02:14:27,657 --> 02:14:32,937
MARISHA: I see, I can't hurt him anymore, I see
Scanlan, that's all I can really see?

2132
02:14:32,937 --> 02:14:36,269
MATT: Scanlan you can see over there, but even
then he's too far away for a Healing Word, I think.

2133
02:14:36,269 --> 02:14:38,127
MARISHA: That's it, that's my turn.

2134
02:14:38,127 --> 02:14:39,620
SAM: Well, kill Kevdak, then.

2135
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:40,952
MATT: Pike, you're up.

2136
02:14:40,952 --> 02:14:47,317
ASHLEY: All right, so I'm going to look at the three
around me, one of them fell off the roof, so

2137
02:14:47,317 --> 02:14:48,851
there's only three there, right?

2138
02:14:48,851 --> 02:14:53,453
MATT: Correct, there are three, ah. There are five
there total, actually.

2139
02:14:53,453 --> 02:14:54,941
ASHLEY: Well, one of them fell the roof.

2140
02:14:54,941 --> 02:14:56,575
LIAM: You accidentally knocked one off the roof,
Matt, five minutes ago.

2141
02:14:56,575 --> 02:14:58,004
MATT: That's good to know.

2142
02:14:58,004 --> 02:14:59,202
ASHLEY: There's how many there?

2143
02:14:59,202 --> 02:15:00,335
MATT: There's four of them there.

2144
02:15:00,335 --> 02:15:02,019
LIAM: He's drunk, fell asleep.

2145
02:15:02,019 --> 02:15:03,472
MATT: No, it's fine.

2146
02:15:03,472 --> 02:15:06,295
ASHLEY: I'm going to tell them.

2147
02:15:06,295 --> 02:15:08,125
LAURA: I'm a barbarian.

2148
02:15:08,125 --> 02:15:09,910
ASHLEY: I'm a barbarian.

2149
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:11,570
MATT: There we go. That'll work.

2150
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:21,562
ASHLEY: I'm going to look at them and I am going
to Command all four of them to attack each other.

2151
02:15:21,562 --> 02:15:26,319
At fourth level.

2152
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:29,441
LIAM: And they're all by their allies so they
should get advantage on each other.

2153
02:15:29,441 --> 02:15:45,274
MATT: Well, technically it doesn't work that way.
All right. All right, so. What's the DC on that?

2154
02:15:45,274 --> 02:15:48,969
MATT and SAM: Spell DC.

2155
02:15:48,969 --> 02:15:50,632
ASHLEY: 16.

2156
02:15:50,632 --> 02:16:00,001
MATT: That's a failure. That's a failure. That's a
20, so that succeeds. That's a failure. So one of

2157
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:02,681
them succeeded, three of them didn't.

2158
02:16:02,681 --> 02:16:08,017
TRAVIS: What a call. What. A. Call.

2159
02:16:08,017 --> 02:16:09,510
ASHLEY: Well, hopefully, hopefully.

2160
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:11,199
MATT: So. Does that end your turn?

2161
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:12,350
ASHLEY: No.

2162
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:13,785
MATT: Your bonus action still, what are you going
to do?

2163
02:16:13,785 --> 02:16:15,261
SAM: Heal thyself!

2164
02:16:15,261 --> 02:16:21,816
MATT: You do still have Spiritual Weapon up if you
want to use your bonus action to do that.

2165
02:16:21,816 --> 02:16:29,648
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon.

2166
02:16:29,648 --> 02:16:32,700
MATT: The Spiritual Weapon can only move 20 feet.

2167
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:33,697
ASHLEY: Say again?

2168
02:16:33,697 --> 02:16:35,000
MATT: It can only move 20 feet as a bonus action.

2169
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,423
SAM: Oh, so it can only catch up to him.

2170
02:16:36,423 --> 02:16:43,100
LIAM: Diagonally. Right on his ass. Yeah!

2171
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:44,731
TALIESIN: It flies over objects, too.

2172
02:16:44,731 --> 02:16:49,912
MATT: But you can't see him right now, you'd have
to move over to have him in view.

2173
02:16:49,912 --> 02:16:53,969
LAURA: And one of them would get an opportunity
now because--

2174
02:16:53,969 --> 02:16:57,708
MATT: One of them would, if you were to try and
dodge past, yeah. What do you want to do?

2175
02:16:57,708 --> 02:16:59,253
ASHLEY: I have to move anyway.

2176
02:16:59,253 --> 02:17:00,797
MATT: It's up to you. What do you want to do?

2177
02:17:00,797 --> 02:17:02,577
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to-- yeah.

2178
02:17:02,577 --> 02:17:05,937
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you
try to tumble in your armor between the legs of

2179
02:17:05,937 --> 02:17:07,361
one of the guys in front of you.

2180
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:09,926
SAM: Tumbling!

2181
02:17:09,926 --> 02:17:11,391
LAURA: You can do it, Pike!

2182
02:17:11,391 --> 02:17:14,103
ASHLEY: I have inspiration?

2183
02:17:14,103 --> 02:17:18,210
SAM: Oh, you do have inspiration! And you'll need
it, it looks like.

2184
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:24,924
MATT: Whatever your acrobatics is.

2185
02:17:24,924 --> 02:17:29,427
SAM: With advantage. With triple disadvantage.

2186
02:17:29,427 --> 02:17:34,498
MATT: What is it?

2187
02:17:34,498 --> 02:17:35,702
ASHLEY: 14?

2188
02:17:35,702 --> 02:17:40,021
MATT: 14. Let me double-check here real fast.

2189
02:17:40,021 --> 02:17:43,680
SAM: Oh, he's going to the book for this. For a
somersault!

2190
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:46,524
TALIESIN: And isn't this guy technically flanked
by enemies now?

2191
02:17:46,524 --> 02:17:48,602
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm not going to somersault, I'm
going to sneak around.

2192
02:17:48,602 --> 02:17:51,990
LIAM: Can't she run under his balls and--

2193
02:17:51,990 --> 02:17:53,809
SAM: It's okay, let the DM DM.

2194
02:17:53,809 --> 02:17:59,367
MATT: Let me deal with it, guys. You don't want to
prod me right now.

2195
02:17:59,367 --> 02:18:02,792
SAM: Chapter three: Somersaults.

2196
02:18:02,792 --> 02:18:05,720
TALIESIN: All that I have and more.

2197
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:11,142
LIAM: Matt, you do amazing, every week you do
amazing and we're all going to die.

2198
02:18:11,142 --> 02:18:18,459
MATT: Let's see the roll there. All right, so you
manage to barely push past, but you do trigger a

2199
02:18:18,459 --> 02:18:25,063
second attack of opportunity to do so. From that
guy, that big half-orc there that gets in your way.

2200
02:18:25,063 --> 02:18:33,609
So that's two strikes against you, that is a
natural 20. And that's going to be a 13.

2201
02:18:33,609 --> 02:18:35,274
ASHLEY: Okay, well that misses.

2202
02:18:35,274 --> 02:18:43,454
MATT: So that is a pretty low roll, ten points of
slashing damage.

2203
02:18:43,454 --> 02:18:46,948
ASHLEY: I'm alive, I'm alive.

2204
02:18:46,948 --> 02:18:48,608
MATT: What are you at? What're you at?

2205
02:18:48,608 --> 02:18:50,834
ASHLEY: I am at 15.

2206
02:18:50,834 --> 02:19:00,041
MATT: So as you dodge past, get slammed by two
blades, you arc around the corner and they're all

2207
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:04,456
looking at each other, confused, some of them
affected by this magic they aren't expecting, and

2208
02:19:04,456 --> 02:19:09,846
you rush around and you see in the distance
Kevdak, who's now getting shot a couple times,

2209
02:19:09,846 --> 02:19:15,284
gets set on fire, flames burst up, and he starts
screaming out in pain. As you turn the corner, you

2210
02:19:15,284 --> 02:19:21,777
look over at your Spiritual Weapon, and you can
nudge it forward. Right there, its full movement,

2211
02:19:21,777 --> 02:19:26,494
20 feet. Go ahead and make an attack with your
spell attack modifier. Does not have advantage

2212
02:19:26,494 --> 02:19:28,593
because he is no longer paralyzed.

2213
02:19:28,593 --> 02:19:32,447
ASHLEY: 20.

2214
02:19:32,447 --> 02:19:35,770
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. So 4d8
plus four.

2215
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:37,518
SAM: Oh wow, that's good.

2216
02:19:37,518 --> 02:19:39,709
TALIESIN: Oh no, it doesn't fuck around.

2217
02:19:39,709 --> 02:19:40,898
MATT: Still halved, but.

2218
02:19:40,898 --> 02:19:43,255
LIAM: Yeah well. C'mon Sarenrae.

2219
02:19:43,255 --> 02:19:50,162
ASHLEY: Okay. Plus what?

2220
02:19:50,162 --> 02:19:51,737
MATT: Plus four.

2221
02:19:51,737 --> 02:19:53,161
ASHLEY: All right, 24.

2222
02:19:53,161 --> 02:19:55,518
MATT: 24 halved, to 12.

2223
02:19:55,518 --> 02:19:56,835
ASHLEY: Fuck!

2224
02:19:56,835 --> 02:19:58,477
TRAVIS: I know, I forget about it too.

2225
02:19:58,477 --> 02:19:59,721
MATT: Yeah, I know.

2226
02:19:59,721 --> 02:20:00,780
TRAVIS: I forget about it too.

2227
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:02,922
TALIESIN: This is how we all feel watching you
fight, by the way.

2228
02:20:02,922 --> 02:20:08,366
MATT: So the blade drifts over and in a giant arc
swings down with a resounding shining metallic

2229
02:20:08,366 --> 02:20:14,624
slam. The blade streaks through and cuts this
swath, the blade doesn't stop, it passes through

2230
02:20:14,624 --> 02:20:20,390
and leaves this scar across his body of burned
radiant energy. (grunt of pain) Looks over and

2231
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:26,741
glares at you from across the open cobblestone of
this marketplace, and you see for a second that

2232
02:20:26,741 --> 02:20:32,082
look that Grog saw that caused him to drop his
weapon, you suddenly feel this quake in your soul.

2233
02:20:32,082 --> 02:20:35,007
This is a powerful entity whose hatred is now bent
on you.

2234
02:20:35,007 --> 02:20:38,104
ASHLEY: I can still move a little bit more, right?
Because that was only--

2235
02:20:38,104 --> 02:20:42,192
MATT: You can if you'd like to. You may take more
attacks of opportunity, though.

2236
02:20:42,192 --> 02:20:43,977
LAURA: What, why?

2237
02:20:43,977 --> 02:20:48,572
MATT: In order for her to move further, you might
move out of combat with the other guys that are there.

2238
02:20:48,572 --> 02:20:50,620
LIAM: But they're all attacking each other.

2239
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:55,471
MATT: The Command move means on their next turn
they attack each other. Doesn't mean that they're

2240
02:20:55,471 --> 02:20:56,902
charmed or dominated.

2241
02:20:56,902 --> 02:21:02,766
ASHLEY: But how many feet did I move, how many
feet am I able to move anyway?

2242
02:21:02,766 --> 02:21:05,069
MATT: That would've been ten feet, you can move 15
more.

2243
02:21:05,069 --> 02:21:07,146
ASHLEY: Okay, I can move 15 more anyway.

2244
02:21:07,146 --> 02:21:10,399
MATT: Yeah. But you will take two attacks of
opportunity if you move out of range of these two.

2245
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:14,044
ASHLEY: But wouldn't that be included in the
attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total?

2246
02:21:14,044 --> 02:21:18,899
MATT: You can move 25 total because of your tiny
feet. You moved ten, you have 15 more feet you can move.

2247
02:21:18,899 --> 02:21:20,418
MARISHA: Your tiny feet.

2248
02:21:20,418 --> 02:21:24,982
ASHLEY: Should I stay? I'll just stay.

2249
02:21:24,982 --> 02:21:26,612
MATT: Okay.

2250
02:21:26,612 --> 02:21:32,632
SAM: You need to heal yourself, dude.

2251
02:21:32,632 --> 02:21:33,978
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know.

2252
02:21:33,978 --> 02:21:37,270
MATT: Barbarians are going now. This one picks up
the gauntlet and is going to rush over.

2253
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:39,100
MARISHA: Fuck!

2254
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:44,324
MATT: And bring it to Kevdak, and he's going to go
ahead and hold it there, as Kevdak takes his arm and--

2255
02:21:44,324 --> 02:21:45,774
MARISHA: Is the arm still in it?

2256
02:21:45,774 --> 02:21:49,974
MATT: The arm is still in it, yeah. And he looks
at it and takes it with his free hand and clutches

2257
02:21:49,974 --> 02:21:53,805
it to his chest. And looks around at the other
ones, says, "We're going." And he--

2258
02:21:53,805 --> 02:21:55,977
TALIESIN: Wait, was he holding a weapon?

2259
02:21:55,977 --> 02:21:58,533
MATT: Yes, he has no weapons, his weapon was
pulled away from him.

2260
02:21:58,533 --> 02:22:00,022
TALIESIN: I thought someone brought him his
weapon.

2261
02:22:00,022 --> 02:22:01,723
MATT: Oh, brought the hammer, he brings up the
hammer as well, but he doesn't--

2262
02:22:01,723 --> 02:22:04,749
TALIESIN: But I thought he was hold--I'm trying,
yeah, no, I'm desperately trying to give a reason

2263
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:05,905
why this couldn't work.

2264
02:22:05,905 --> 02:22:08,498
MATT: No, he has no weapon on him currently. He
tried to reach for it, but he had no functioning

2265
02:22:08,498 --> 02:22:12,667
arm at the time. He told someone to pick it up, so
someone has your flaming warhammer. These guys

2266
02:22:12,667 --> 02:22:27,076
here are going to move over here. Move over here.
And that one's going to be attacking Pike. Over

2267
02:22:27,076 --> 02:22:38,669
here, that's two attacks on Pike. That's going to
be a 13? And a 14. Rolled really low on that one.

2268
02:22:38,669 --> 02:22:41,008
TALIESIN: Praise Sarenrae, praise Sarenrae.

2269
02:22:41,008 --> 02:22:46,058
MATT: You hear the growl behind you, and without
even turning your head, you slam your shield up

2270
02:22:46,058 --> 02:22:50,086
and deflect one of the blows. Look over your
shoulder and glare at it as another one comes

2271
02:22:50,086 --> 02:22:53,931
down, and this-- you take your mace and swing it
in a wide arc over and slam their blade against

2272
02:22:53,931 --> 02:23:00,460
the stone wall of the side, deflecting the entire
attack. As that's happening, both of those guys go

2273
02:23:00,460 --> 02:23:06,334
forward. Two and a one. Goes up against one of the
peasants and strikes and the peasant ducks out of

2274
02:23:06,334 --> 02:23:08,159
the way and manages to avoid the attacks.

2275
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:09,304
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2276
02:23:09,304 --> 02:23:15,175
MATT: This guy here with the giant club goes down
and dodges one of the attacks, the other one does

2277
02:23:15,175 --> 02:23:20,037
come down at 11, yeah, this peasant gets smashed.

2278
02:23:20,037 --> 02:23:21,637
LAURA: Oh no, was that the little kid?

2279
02:23:21,637 --> 02:23:23,247
MATT: No, this was the drunker guy.

2280
02:23:23,247 --> 02:23:25,528
ASHLEY: Well, he didn't feel it.

2281
02:23:25,528 --> 02:23:27,523
TALIESIN: Died happy.

2282
02:23:27,523 --> 02:23:33,812
MATT: All right. That ends their turn, it's the
druids' turn now.

2283
02:23:33,812 --> 02:23:38,310
LAURA: There's so many. They all get to go.

2284
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:42,094
SAM: That's how they all feel when we attack.

2285
02:23:42,094 --> 02:23:48,853
MATT: This druid here is going to move forward,
seeing you over there, Vax. Reaches out towards

2286
02:23:48,853 --> 02:23:57,704
you as it only has its 4th-level spells and lower
left, because of you, you Counterspell

2287
02:23:57,704 --> 02:24:04,847
motherfucker. It's going to go ahead and cast
Blight on you, Liam. I'm going to need you to go

2288
02:24:04,847 --> 02:24:09,147
ahead and make a constitution saving throw, as the
druid reaches out at you with its hand and says,

2289
02:24:09,147 --> 02:24:17,719
"Kevdak! Inside!" and concentrates, gripping out.
This female goliath, you can see with these thick

2290
02:24:17,719 --> 02:24:22,506
braids in the back of her head, pulled into a
very, very tight braid down to the lower part of

2291
02:24:22,506 --> 02:24:27,756
her back, reaches out and grasps. You feel the
blood begin to pool in parts of your body and your

2292
02:24:27,756 --> 02:24:29,123
veins turn dark around.

2293
02:24:29,123 --> 02:24:30,245
LIAM: Now, constitution save, right?

2294
02:24:30,245 --> 02:24:31,462
MATT: Yes.

2295
02:24:31,462 --> 02:24:36,825
LIAM: This is real bad. What is that? That's
eight.

2296
02:24:36,825 --> 02:24:39,506
SAM: Eight total?

2297
02:24:39,506 --> 02:24:41,320
MATT: Total. All right.

2298
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:43,284
LIAM: I'm Kate Moss, man.

2299
02:24:43,284 --> 02:24:50,336
TALIESIN: Don't make that face.

2300
02:24:50,336 --> 02:24:52,814
MATT: You take 41 points of necrotic damage.

2301
02:24:52,814 --> 02:24:54,004
MARISHA: Wow.

2302
02:24:54,004 --> 02:25:00,288
MATT: As you feel the energy pulse through your
entire body and it's like all the blood in your

2303
02:25:00,288 --> 02:25:05,501
body momentarily becomes toxic. Your vision blurs
and you feel the dizziness hit you and you almost

2304
02:25:05,501 --> 02:25:07,841
stumble to one knee but you catch yourself against
the wall.

2305
02:25:07,841 --> 02:25:10,761
LIAM: It just halved me.

2306
02:25:10,761 --> 02:25:16,874
MATT: That ends the druids' turn. Now the
blademongers are going to go. All right. These

2307
02:25:16,874 --> 02:25:18,600
guys are all going to attack each other.

2308
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,907
ALL: Yeah!

2309
02:25:19,907 --> 02:25:21,259
MATT: Except for that one.

2310
02:25:21,259 --> 02:25:23,254
TALIESIN: Are they not going to attack him as
well?

2311
02:25:23,254 --> 02:25:26,963
MATT: Well, one of them's going to go ahead and
attack Pike, because it was the one that wasn't

2312
02:25:26,963 --> 02:25:33,324
affected by the Command spell. That's going to be
a 19. No? Okay!

2313
02:25:33,324 --> 02:25:34,518
ASHLEY: Just misses.

2314
02:25:34,518 --> 02:25:39,974
MATT: And a 13. No. Cannot hit this armored little
gnome, who's pushed against the wall, and you're

2315
02:25:39,974 --> 02:25:43,602
deflecting blows and taking hits against the armor
that are denting the front of it, and you're

2316
02:25:43,602 --> 02:25:44,959
grinning and bearing it.

2317
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:47,416
ASHLEY: I'm growling! Arrr!

2318
02:25:47,416 --> 02:25:49,199
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Arr!

2319
02:25:49,199 --> 02:25:56,563
MATT: These guys are attacking each other now.
That is seven-- it hits. They can't hit you but

2320
02:25:56,563 --> 02:26:02,428
they can hit each other. Two attacks against that
guy, and then the other guy. Both hit. So the

2321
02:26:02,428 --> 02:26:08,117
first guy takes 14. 24 points of damage.

2322
02:26:08,117 --> 02:26:09,661
SAM: Are you okay?

2323
02:26:09,661 --> 02:26:10,902
ASHLEY: 15.

2324
02:26:10,902 --> 02:26:12,287
SAM: Do you want us to do something?

2325
02:26:12,287 --> 02:26:13,590
ASHLEY: I can. I'm like--

2326
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:14,910
MARISHA: Just focus on the mission.

2327
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:16,247
ASHLEY: Focus on the mission at hand.

2328
02:26:16,247 --> 02:26:32,149
MATT: Ends up-- That guy there then also takes 22
points of damage on them. Okay. They start hacking

2329
02:26:32,149 --> 02:26:40,316
into each other with their blades suddenly, trying
to figure out what's happening. And technically

2330
02:26:40,316 --> 02:26:43,793
another barbarian strikes, so the third one who
actually missed you? That would've been an attack

2331
02:26:43,793 --> 02:26:50,263
against its own guy, because that was the one that
didn't hit, so he would've been-- Once again

2332
02:26:50,263 --> 02:26:55,253
against this guy. So he deals an additional 13
points of damage against one of the other ones.

2333
02:26:55,253 --> 02:27:05,193
Okay. Got you. So that finishes their turn there.
So these guys here are going to move around the

2334
02:27:05,193 --> 02:27:12,700
fire, this guy's going to move up here.

2335
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:15,572
LIAM: Everyone's at disadvantage with me, just a
reminder.

2336
02:27:15,572 --> 02:27:23,450
MATT: Yeah. This guy here is going to go ahead and
move one, two, three. And then using Greenbeard,

2337
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:32,016
who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental
arm and alley-oops him up onto the roof. With the

2338
02:27:32,016 --> 02:27:33,434
acrobatics roll. Rolls a one.

2339
02:27:33,434 --> 02:27:35,723
ASHLEY: He dies!

2340
02:27:35,723 --> 02:27:39,760
MATT: This guy gets slammed into the side and
falls back to the ground, missing his turn.

2341
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,294
LAURA: Falls right back down like some other loser
that I know of.

2342
02:27:42,294 --> 02:27:47,890
MATT: Yeah, (laughs). Greenbeard miscalculates and
actually slams him against the wall. And then the

2343
02:27:47,890 --> 02:27:54,652
goliath sort of slides down. Takes four points of
bludgeoning damage from that.

2344
02:27:54,652 --> 02:27:56,711
(laughter)

2345
02:27:56,711 --> 02:28:06,430
MATT: All righty. And that guy there is going to
go ahead and strike at the child.

2346
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,509
LAURA: No!

2347
02:28:07,509 --> 02:28:13,312
MATT: A three. And 14.

2348
02:28:13,312 --> 02:28:15,066
MARISHA: Shifty kid, c'mon.

2349
02:28:15,066 --> 02:28:17,079
SAM: He's a little weasel, he's a little weasel.

2350
02:28:17,079 --> 02:28:22,630
MATT: No, he's going to hit the kid.

2351
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:25,749
LAURA: He's a scrapper, he's dodgy. No!

2352
02:28:25,749 --> 02:28:28,126
MATT: Kid gets cleaved.

2353
02:28:28,126 --> 02:28:31,502
LAURA: We didn't save anybody and we killed
ourselves.

2354
02:28:31,502 --> 02:28:34,389
ASHLEY: If we kill everybody, maybe I can raise
him.

2355
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:42,512
MATT: They're now trying to find a way to draw you
out. They're taking turns doing this, keeping, as

2356
02:28:42,512 --> 02:28:48,526
each person they strike down they look about the
rooftops again for more of you. That's going to go

2357
02:28:48,526 --> 02:28:57,397
ahead, and these guys here are going to go ahead
and start swarming over towards the front. This

2358
02:28:57,397 --> 02:29:07,661
guy here (counting) can't quite get to you, Vax.
This guy here, seeing Percy jump down, is going to

2359
02:29:07,661 --> 02:29:15,249
go ahead and jump down to meet you from behind.
See if he makes his. He fails on a two. He falls

2360
02:29:15,249 --> 02:29:17,117
prone. Takes--

2361
02:29:17,117 --> 02:29:18,891
LIAM: "I'm coming. Whoa!"

2362
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:21,249
MATT: He takes 12 points of falling damage

2363
02:29:21,249 --> 02:29:23,048
LIAM: "Ah, help."

2364
02:29:23,048 --> 02:29:30,834
MATT: However, he does use the rest of his
movement to stand back up and is going to take two

2365
02:29:30,834 --> 02:29:35,777
swings at you, Percy. That's going to be a 23 to
hit?

2366
02:29:35,777 --> 02:29:42,949
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull my magic shield,
actually, I would have to have a 24 AC for that

2367
02:29:42,949 --> 02:29:44,040
not to hit.

2368
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:45,031
MATT: Correct.

2369
02:29:45,031 --> 02:29:46,095
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm--

2370
02:29:46,095 --> 02:29:53,839
MATT: Okay. Second one's a natural 20. So the
first strike hits you for 12 points of slashing

2371
02:29:53,839 --> 02:30:00,231
damage. Second strike, double ones on the crit, so
that's four, eight points of slashing damage with

2372
02:30:00,231 --> 02:30:06,641
the second hit. (laughs) I rolled double ones on
his crit, that's really frustrating. You're fine

2373
02:30:06,641 --> 02:30:10,439
with that. All right, that ends their turn, top of
the round, Vex, you're up.

2374
02:30:10,439 --> 02:30:11,423
LAURA: Okay.

2375
02:30:11,423 --> 02:30:15,997
MATT: As you're standing there now, bleeding
profusely, holding the necklace that holds Grog,

2376
02:30:15,997 --> 02:30:18,227
what are you doing?

2377
02:30:18,227 --> 02:30:23,383
LAURA: I'm going to fly over right above Kevdak.

2378
02:30:23,383 --> 02:30:30,887
TRAVIS: How high?

2379
02:30:30,887 --> 02:30:34,023
LAURA: Like a good 50 feet.

2380
02:30:34,023 --> 02:30:37,203
MATT: Yeah, that's 50. All right.

2381
02:30:37,203 --> 02:30:48,571
LAURA: All right. I'm going to
Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight

2382
02:30:48,571 --> 02:30:51,659
out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball
Trinket.

2383
02:30:51,659 --> 02:30:53,256
TRAVIS: And I am willing.

2384
02:30:53,256 --> 02:30:54,756
MATT: All right.

2385
02:30:54,756 --> 02:30:57,029
SAM: Aren't you at death's door?

2386
02:30:57,029 --> 02:30:57,997
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2387
02:30:57,997 --> 02:31:00,893
MATT: I'll say essentially because you held your
action last turn, if you wanted to go ahead and

2388
02:31:00,893 --> 02:31:05,243
take your action to do a drop attack on this point
here.

2389
02:31:05,243 --> 02:31:11,173
LAURA: Can this be my bonus, so I'm dropping him
out is the bonus, and then I still can attack? I

2390
02:31:11,173 --> 02:31:15,873
mean, it's only a locket. It's not like it's a
whole move.

2391
02:31:15,873 --> 02:31:17,789
MATT: Yeah, I'd say it's your bonus action to do
it, yeah.

2392
02:31:17,789 --> 02:31:18,824
LAURA: Okay.

2393
02:31:18,824 --> 02:31:27,265
MATT: So, Grog, you were released, falling down to
land on top of Kevdak with the bloodaxe in a

2394
02:31:27,265 --> 02:31:28,515
downward arc.

2395
02:31:28,515 --> 02:31:30,073
TRAVIS: And a big windup as we're coming down.

2396
02:31:30,073 --> 02:31:31,473
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

2397
02:31:31,473 --> 02:31:32,976
TRAVIS: Any chance I can make this reckless?

2398
02:31:32,976 --> 02:31:34,326
MATT: Yeah.

2399
02:31:34,326 --> 02:31:38,004
LAURA: No! Then they all get advantages against
you again.

2400
02:31:38,004 --> 02:31:39,250
MATT: Up to you.

2401
02:31:39,250 --> 02:31:46,995
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god for that. Natural. 20. Look
at it. The first one was a one.

2402
02:31:46,995 --> 02:31:48,263
ASHLEY: Fuck you!

2403
02:31:48,263 --> 02:31:53,578
MATT: Ones and twenties, man, you got to stop
this. And that's why he did reckless.

2404
02:31:53,578 --> 02:31:57,740
(screaming and cheering)

2405
02:31:57,740 --> 02:32:00,176
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage on
this.

2406
02:32:00,176 --> 02:32:01,829
ASHLEY: Get 'im, Grog.

2407
02:32:01,829 --> 02:32:05,218
LAURA: Does that mean he gets the three 12s
again?

2408
02:32:05,218 --> 02:32:09,333
MATT: With the Brutal Critical at this level, how
many extra dice is it for you?

2409
02:32:09,333 --> 02:32:14,353
TRAVIS: Brutal Critical is one additional damage
die during critical hits.

2410
02:32:14,353 --> 02:32:17,689
MATT: But then that's gone up since you leveled
previously.

2411
02:32:17,689 --> 02:32:18,866
TRAVIS: That's true.

2412
02:32:18,866 --> 02:32:24,206
MATT: So you are now at, I believe-- so Brutal
Critical, yeah, 13 increases to two. So you roll

2413
02:32:24,206 --> 02:32:29,314
an additional 2d12 on the attack. So roll 1d12
plus, you're not raging anymore, because you spent

2414
02:32:29,314 --> 02:32:30,344
the last round.

2415
02:32:30,344 --> 02:32:31,711
TRAVIS: That's right, that's three.

2416
02:32:31,711 --> 02:32:32,980
MATT: All right, so plus three.

2417
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:34,174
TRAVIS: So ten.

2418
02:32:34,174 --> 02:32:37,218
MATT: Ten. Plus two more d12s.

2419
02:32:37,218 --> 02:32:45,368
TRAVIS: 12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32.

2420
02:32:45,368 --> 02:32:47,181
LAURA: And then double that?

2421
02:32:47,181 --> 02:32:50,670
His crits don't get double?

2422
02:32:50,695 --> 02:32:52,703
MATT: You only double the first roll.

2423
02:32:52,703 --> 02:32:54,786
TRAVIS: Yeah, double the first, right. Which was
ten, so 20, so 42.

2424
02:32:54,786 --> 02:32:58,040
MATT: 42, brings it to 21 damage.

2425
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,714
How do you want to do this?

2426
02:32:59,714 --> 02:33:04,569
(screaming and cheering)

2427
02:33:04,569 --> 02:33:05,687
MARISHA: It worked!

2428
02:33:05,687 --> 02:33:07,002
LIAM: Poetic justice!

2429
02:33:07,002 --> 02:33:14,573
MATT: As the shadow fires from the necklace as she
holds it aloft, bleeding and shaking, you appear,

2430
02:33:14,573 --> 02:33:22,012
and dive down in silence. The square coming
towards you, as Kevdak, clutching in the one

2431
02:33:22,012 --> 02:33:26,415
nearly ruined arm, the other arm that you
bisected, is turning the corner, about to open the

2432
02:33:26,415 --> 02:33:31,671
door to dive into the house to avoid it, looks up
just in time to see you streaking down.

2433
02:33:31,671 --> 02:33:32,901
What do you do?

2434
02:33:32,901 --> 02:33:39,497
TRAVIS: I say: For Strongjaw! And I sink the axe
right into his neck and part him perfectly down

2435
02:33:39,497 --> 02:33:40,986
the middle.

2436
02:33:40,986 --> 02:33:47,759
MATT: With the sheer force of the blow, the weight
behind it, and the intent, the axe hits him right

2437
02:33:47,759 --> 02:33:52,381
in the side of the neck, cleaves off part of his
ear, shaves off part of his skin here, exposing

2438
02:33:52,381 --> 02:33:58,068
the jawbone, hits here, breaks the clavicle, tears
through, and every single rib is destroyed. It

2439
02:33:58,068 --> 02:34:02,773
cuts right through the center of this giant body
until it gets to about the midsection where it

2440
02:34:02,773 --> 02:34:11,798
catches, finally. The upper torso splits open and
covers you with gore, however, you still impact,

2441
02:34:11,798 --> 02:34:14,709
not raging.

2442
02:34:14,709 --> 02:34:16,201
TRAVIS: Yep. Nope.

2443
02:34:16,201 --> 02:34:17,482
MATT: You take--

2444
02:34:17,482 --> 02:34:18,691
SAM: He's going to die.

2445
02:34:18,691 --> 02:34:22,750
TRAVIS: Don't care.

2446
02:34:22,750 --> 02:34:28,370
MATT: 25 points of fall damage from the impact.

2447
02:34:28,370 --> 02:34:33,927
TRAVIS: That will put me unconscious and 21 points
under.

2448
02:34:33,927 --> 02:34:40,018
MATT: And 21 points under. You have that barbarian
ability-- Would that be part of this?

2449
02:34:40,018 --> 02:34:41,442
TRAVIS: I have Relentless Rage.

2450
02:34:41,442 --> 02:34:46,793
MATT: If you drop to zero hit points while raging,
you're not raging. So yeah. As you shout, the

2451
02:34:46,793 --> 02:34:53,861
blow, in a very Superman-versus-Doomsday way,
cleaves him in half, and as you slam into the

2452
02:34:53,861 --> 02:34:59,255
ground, you pull the axe free as your shattered
legbones give under and you fall to the ground.

2453
02:34:59,255 --> 02:35:05,365
You smile as you see his form crumple, and then
you (impact) face-first into the ground before him.

2454
02:35:05,365 --> 02:35:16,151
LAURA: Who's next? Oh, I'm still going. It's still
my turn!

2455
02:35:16,151 --> 02:35:27,372
MATT: It's still your turn. You watch as every
single Herd member in the entire open square gasps

2456
02:35:27,372 --> 02:35:32,995
at this whole sight. They all turn hearing you
scream "For Strongjaw" and see this happen. As

2457
02:35:32,995 --> 02:35:39,073
Kevdak's body slumps to the ground, it shrinks
back down to its average size, and you crumple to

2458
02:35:39,073 --> 02:35:43,617
the ground, smiling, and fall next to him. And
everyone takes a moment of breathless silence.

2459
02:35:43,617 --> 02:35:45,193
What are you doing, Vex?

2460
02:35:45,193 --> 02:35:46,563
LAURA: Oh my god.

2461
02:35:46,563 --> 02:35:47,903
SAM: Wait, are you dead, Grog?

2462
02:35:47,903 --> 02:35:49,492
LAURA and LIAM: He's unconscious.

2463
02:35:49,492 --> 02:35:56,600
LAURA: I mean, my only option to heal him is to
land and touch him.

2464
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:00,207
SAM: He's surrounded by baddies.

2465
02:36:00,207 --> 02:36:05,032
LAURA: Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch
Grog.

2466
02:36:05,032 --> 02:36:08,448
MATT: Okay. What's the speed of the broom?

2467
02:36:08,448 --> 02:36:10,541
LAURA: I don't know.

2468
02:36:10,541 --> 02:36:12,540
MATT: It should say on the broom how fast you can
move on it.

2469
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:15,902
LAURA: Do I have that somewhere?

2470
02:36:15,902 --> 02:36:21,524
SAM: You know, in your broom chapter.

2471
02:36:21,524 --> 02:36:23,228
MATT: Here we go, I'll find it for you.

2472
02:36:23,228 --> 02:36:25,452
LAURA: Oh wait, wait.

2473
02:36:25,452 --> 02:36:42,041
MATT: Just a moment, guys. Broom of Flying. Speed
of 50 feet. So you moved from over here, which

2474
02:36:42,041 --> 02:36:45,901
would have put you-- it's about 50 to get there.
So you could use your action to dash with it,

2475
02:36:45,901 --> 02:36:47,572
you'd land, that's all you could do.

2476
02:36:47,572 --> 02:36:56,655
LAURA: I couldn't do anything else? Okay. Then I
guess I'm going to stay where I am and-- Jeez. Can

2477
02:36:56,655 --> 02:37:01,906
I hold my action? I'm going to hold my action
until--

2478
02:37:01,906 --> 02:37:08,289
MATT: Yeah, it's an action to feed a potion to
anyone.

2479
02:37:08,289 --> 02:37:09,452
LAURA: Yeah.

2480
02:37:09,452 --> 02:37:12,143
MATT: What are you going to do, Vex? Hurry up.

2481
02:37:12,143 --> 02:37:16,385
LAURA: I'm going to hold my action until Grog is
healed.

2482
02:37:16,385 --> 02:37:19,920
MATT: Okay. Okay.

2483
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:23,493
LAURA: And I-- can I shout anything?

2484
02:37:23,493 --> 02:37:24,816
MATT: If you want to.

2485
02:37:24,816 --> 02:37:30,349
LAURA: I'm going to shout, witness Grog Strongjaw,
and bend the knee!

2486
02:37:30,349 --> 02:37:34,309
ASHLEY: It's great, it's great, it's great.

2487
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:37,835
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2488
02:37:37,835 --> 02:37:41,581
LAURA: Natural 20!

2489
02:37:41,581 --> 02:37:43,962
(yelling and cheering)

2490
02:37:43,962 --> 02:37:45,604
MATT: Don't hit the table, I was going to go
inspect it.

2491
02:37:45,604 --> 02:37:47,610
LAURA: No, I hit, I hit, but it was, it was a 20,
I swear.

2492
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:52,155
MATT: No, I trust you guys. I trust you guys.

2493
02:37:52,155 --> 02:37:54,159
SAM: It's all ones and twenties.

2494
02:37:54,159 --> 02:37:58,284
We have these two-sided dice. Just a one and
a 20.

2495
02:37:58,284 --> 02:38:02,819
MATT: This is going to be an interesting night to
explain to the internet, guys. All right.

2496
02:38:02,819 --> 02:38:06,726
LIAM: You opened it up to the dice, and the dice
decided.

2497
02:38:06,726 --> 02:38:08,387
ASHLEY: We witnessed, we witnessed.

2498
02:38:08,387 --> 02:38:22,489
MATT: Okay. So. At this point in time, you watch
as Greenbeard's form shrinks down and shifts back

2499
02:38:22,489 --> 02:38:32,442
into his goliath form, still busted, he's looking
down at the destroyed, crumpled body of Kevdak,

2500
02:38:32,442 --> 02:38:39,269
and you there on the ground as well, looking up at
you above and hovering. He looks over at the other

2501
02:38:39,269 --> 02:38:46,017
goliaths nearby here that are rushing in, and they
all step out and backwards, inspecting this body.

2502
02:38:46,017 --> 02:38:53,447
There's a pause, a moment of pause. But they've
all paid attention to what you said. That ends

2503
02:38:53,447 --> 02:38:56,653
your turn. It is now the archers' turn.

2504
02:38:56,653 --> 02:38:58,648
LIAM: Not me right after Vex?

2505
02:38:58,648 --> 02:38:59,975
MATT: I'm sorry, you're up next.

2506
02:38:59,975 --> 02:39:03,523
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to use disengage to back a
little bit away from them, I'm going to scrabble

2507
02:39:03,523 --> 02:39:09,091
up the wall-- where's the light, no-- I want to go
up by Keyleth.

2508
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:10,769
TRAVIS: You're pointing at the screen.

2509
02:39:10,769 --> 02:39:12,021
MATT: So you move around.

2510
02:39:12,021 --> 02:39:18,067
LIAM: I'm not the first one to do that. And pass
her, I want to jump down and land in front of Grog.

2511
02:39:18,067 --> 02:39:21,058
MATT: Okay. So you run past there?

2512
02:39:21,058 --> 02:39:26,878
LIAM: And jump in front of him, between him and--
not Greenbeard, between Grog and everyone over there.

2513
02:39:26,878 --> 02:39:30,349
MATT: Okay, so you'd be leaping, technically onto
the body of Kevdak is what you'd be doing.

2514
02:39:30,349 --> 02:39:31,438
LIAM: That's fine.

2515
02:39:31,438 --> 02:39:32,560
MARISHA: Squish.

2516
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:38,415
MATT: So you land onto Kevdak's form, very angry
slash, I'll say for the purposes of this you're

2517
02:39:38,415 --> 02:39:41,864
there, because Kevdak's body is way too big right
now to put on the field.

2518
02:39:41,864 --> 02:39:43,633
LAURA: But we are so going to loot that.

2519
02:39:43,633 --> 02:39:45,108
MARISHA: So going to loot that shit.

2520
02:39:45,108 --> 02:39:46,310
MATT: All right, you land.

2521
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:47,532
LAURA: If we survive this.

2522
02:39:47,532 --> 02:39:49,433
MATT: With your hasted movement, make an
acrobatics check for the jump.

2523
02:39:49,433 --> 02:39:52,184
LIAM: That's fine. 25.

2524
02:39:52,184 --> 02:39:57,984
MATT: Yeah, you scale up, run, leap, land there,
feet sinking into the body.

2525
02:39:57,984 --> 02:40:05,914
LIAM: And I land on him and I say, Kevdak has
fallen. Will you let Strongjaw rise? And I hold my

2526
02:40:05,914 --> 02:40:07,821
action to attack if they come at me.

2527
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:21,559
MATT: Okay. It's the archers' turn. This archer
has its arrow trained on you and is going to hold

2528
02:40:21,559 --> 02:40:29,679
its action. This archer here is going to move up
to see what's happened, dashing to look out and

2529
02:40:29,679 --> 02:40:33,346
see what happened, doesn't get its turn. This
archer here, who's now moved, moves over to this

2530
02:40:33,346 --> 02:40:38,696
side with its arrow trained on you as well. It's
also going to hold its action. And they're all

2531
02:40:38,696 --> 02:40:42,346
looking at each other at this Mexican standoff
moment where they're all poised and ready.

2532
02:40:42,346 --> 02:40:47,059
Everyone's holding their actions right now. It
would be Kevdak's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

2533
02:40:47,059 --> 02:40:55,356
SAM: I'm pretty far. I'm going to jump down off
the roof and move towards Grog.

2534
02:40:55,356 --> 02:41:07,902
MATT: Okay, so you run down. Okay. The guy who was
up against you has looked over and is not paying

2535
02:41:07,902 --> 02:41:10,079
attention at this moment. Make a stealth check.

2536
02:41:10,079 --> 02:41:13,334
SAM: Oh. Stealth check. 13.

2537
02:41:13,334 --> 02:41:19,133
MATT: 13. As you rush down the thing, he looks
over, looks at you and goes, "Hey. Hey!" And can't

2538
02:41:19,133 --> 02:41:25,461
even catch you, you're too fast. Make an
acrobatics check as you leap off the roof.

2539
02:41:25,461 --> 02:41:28,195
SAM: 19.

2540
02:41:28,195 --> 02:41:36,377
MATT: 19. You gnomish three-point-land in this
square. You're right next to Pike now, you've

2541
02:41:36,377 --> 02:41:40,592
landed next to her. As you're around the corner
now, you see Scanlan (impact) right next to you.

2542
02:41:40,592 --> 02:41:41,993
ASHLEY: Hi!

2543
02:41:41,993 --> 02:41:44,854
MATT: You've got about 15 more feet you can move
if you wanted to.

2544
02:41:44,854 --> 02:41:53,556
SAM: Move 15 feet? Okay. I will, can I, I can't
take her hand and walk too, she can't move right now.

2545
02:41:53,556 --> 02:41:56,184
MATT: No, not at the moment.

2546
02:41:56,184 --> 02:41:57,432
SAM: Okay, well I'm going to continue to walk.

2547
02:41:57,432 --> 02:42:00,137
MATT: I mean, I could say if you wanted to, you
could move half your movement and take her with you.

2548
02:42:00,137 --> 02:42:02,905
SAM: Okay, I'll do that. I'll take her with me.

2549
02:42:02,905 --> 02:42:04,635
MATT: Okay, you take her hand.

2550
02:42:04,635 --> 02:42:14,949
SAM: I'm going to use Healing Word, oh shit, what
just happened?

2551
02:42:14,949 --> 02:42:17,959
MATT: You and Pike move there, holding each
other's hand.

2552
02:42:17,959 --> 02:42:25,897
SAM: Okay. I'm going to use Healing Word on Grog,
and I'm just going to start chanting, Strongjaw!

2553
02:42:25,897 --> 02:42:28,229
Strongjaw! Strongjaw!

2554
02:42:28,229 --> 02:42:31,754
ALL: Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!

2555
02:42:31,754 --> 02:42:33,508
SAM: Communicate that as a Healing Word.

2556
02:42:33,508 --> 02:42:37,519
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll the heal on that. I
also want you to go ahead and make a persuasion check.

2557
02:42:37,519 --> 02:42:39,389
SAM: Me?

2558
02:42:39,389 --> 02:42:40,815
MATT: Yeah.

2559
02:42:40,815 --> 02:42:44,996
SAM: Heal is eight points. What's that do?

2560
02:42:44,996 --> 02:42:46,894
MATT: So you go to zero, and then eight.

2561
02:42:46,894 --> 02:42:48,166
TRAVIS: Okay.

2562
02:42:48,166 --> 02:42:50,949
SAM: And then persuasion check?

2563
02:42:50,949 --> 02:42:52,243
MATT: Yes.

2564
02:42:52,243 --> 02:42:57,245
SAM: Well, I mean, come on.

2565
02:42:57,245 --> 02:42:58,402
TALIESIN: I know.

2566
02:42:58,402 --> 02:42:59,729
SAM: That's 23.

2567
02:42:59,729 --> 02:43:03,364
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Finishes your turn,
Scanlan--?

2568
02:43:03,364 --> 02:43:04,900
SAM: No, I have an action still.

2569
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:06,207
MATT: Yes, you do.

2570
02:43:06,207 --> 02:43:18,045
SAM: So I will cast Bigby's Hand and lift Grog up
30 feet like a fucking god.

2571
02:43:18,045 --> 02:43:19,590
(laughter)

2572
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:26,314
SAM: If he's willing.

2573
02:43:26,314 --> 02:43:36,863
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this, because
I want to do this, this is ridiculous.

2574
02:43:36,863 --> 02:43:42,763
SAM: Oh, I had to cast that at level six, by the
way.

2575
02:43:42,763 --> 02:43:45,268
LIAM: Is it full palm-up, or is it Barcalounger
style?

2576
02:43:45,268 --> 02:43:48,399
MARISHA: Is it like a chair?

2577
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:52,313
SAM: You know what, because he's the god
and the hand is subservient, it's the back of the

2578
02:43:52,313 --> 02:43:55,000
hand like this. It's a dainty lift.

2579
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,704
(laughter)

2580
02:43:56,704 --> 02:44:00,808
MATT: I will say Grog is now currently being held
aloft right there.

2581
02:44:00,808 --> 02:44:02,281
MARISHA: Nice!

2582
02:44:02,281 --> 02:44:09,437
MATT: As the hand is clutching Grog Strongjaw,
lifting him up into the air, you're conscious now

2583
02:44:09,437 --> 02:44:14,070
as the hand's holding you on its back and you get
up from one knee. Grog, it's your turn.

2584
02:44:14,070 --> 02:44:15,143
LIAM: Pinkie's up?

2585
02:44:15,143 --> 02:44:17,563
SAM: Pinkie's up. Tea-time.

2586
02:44:17,563 --> 02:44:31,013
TRAVIS: My herd. Hear me. Fallen is your mighty
leader Kevdak, the very goliath swine who would

2587
02:44:31,013 --> 02:44:38,479
have domesticated you like a common household cat,
who would have made you bend a knee to a mere

2588
02:44:38,479 --> 02:44:44,567
dragon. I show you this. And I reach into the Bag
of Holding and I pull out one of the dragon's

2589
02:44:44,567 --> 02:44:48,110
teeth that is still in there and I toss it into
the middle of the square.

2590
02:44:48,110 --> 02:44:59,005
MATT: Clatters to the ground at the feet of one of
the nearby bladestorms. It stops at his foot. He

2591
02:44:59,005 --> 02:45:01,204
looks at it, picks it up.

2592
02:45:01,204 --> 02:45:09,329
TRAVIS: I would tell you that under the correct
rule, and a return of power to this Herd,

2593
02:45:09,329 --> 02:45:20,799
dragons would bend a knee to the Herd of the
Storm. Where is Zanror?

2594
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:28,529
MATT: They all look at each other and Greenbeard
hobbles out, still wounded and hurt, into the

2595
02:45:28,529 --> 02:45:30,071
center of this area.

2596
02:45:30,071 --> 02:45:31,891
SAM: Does he have an actual name or is that just
his name?

2597
02:45:31,891 --> 02:45:32,892
MATT: Greenbeard's his name.

2598
02:45:32,892 --> 02:45:34,171
SAM: Oh, great.

2599
02:45:34,171 --> 02:45:47,786
MATT: Steps out into the middle, looking up at
you. "Strongjaw. You stand above us all. In a way."

2600
02:45:47,786 --> 02:45:50,231
(laughter)

2601
02:45:50,231 --> 02:45:59,874
MATT: "Claiming dominion over a herd that you fell
to and left behind for years. Though you struck

2602
02:45:59,874 --> 02:46:08,943
"down Kevdak, what do you think makes you aligned
with the interests of our people?"

2603
02:46:08,943 --> 02:46:19,904
TRAVIS: Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do
not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower

2604
02:46:19,904 --> 02:46:29,357
you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire
your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend

2605
02:46:29,357 --> 02:46:37,429
the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight
and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you

2606
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:47,146
can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows.
Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we

2607
02:46:47,146 --> 02:46:52,806
will chase down dragons, gods, and more.

2608
02:46:52,806 --> 02:46:56,254
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

2609
02:46:56,254 --> 02:46:57,660
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on.

2610
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,517
MATT: With advantage on that.

2611
02:46:59,517 --> 02:47:04,859
TRAVIS: Fuck. That's only an 11.

2612
02:47:04,859 --> 02:47:06,618
ASHLEY: Can I use War God's Blessing, or?

2613
02:47:06,618 --> 02:47:08,452
MATT: I don't think it works for abilities.

2614
02:47:08,452 --> 02:47:12,751
MARISHA: Can I assist him with a skywrite
'Strongjaw'?

2615
02:47:12,751 --> 02:47:16,369
MATT: (laughs) Bing! Strongjaw.

2616
02:47:16,369 --> 02:47:20,011
MARISHA: I mean a stormcloud above him?

2617
02:47:20,011 --> 02:47:22,325
ASHLEY: Inspo, inspo, inspiration from anywhere?

2618
02:47:22,325 --> 02:47:27,156
MATT: It's a little late for that. It's okay. At
this point Greenbeard sizes you up from a

2619
02:47:27,156 --> 02:47:31,366
distance. Everyone else is waiting for a word, you
can see everyone is hand on the side of their

2620
02:47:31,366 --> 02:47:37,543
weapons looking at each other and there's this
extremely tense air. Greenbeard turns around and

2621
02:47:37,543 --> 02:47:47,741
looks to two of the individuals near the front of
the building and goes, "Bring out Zanror." And the

2622
02:47:47,741 --> 02:47:52,718
two of them go inside the door and close it behind
them. They step inside the building and there's

2623
02:47:52,718 --> 02:47:58,556
this long silence. You wait for 30 seconds.

2624
02:47:58,556 --> 02:48:01,908
LAURA: Can I take a healing potion while they're
inside? I'm up on the thing.

2625
02:48:01,908 --> 02:48:03,899
MATT: You can, yes.

2626
02:48:03,899 --> 02:48:05,387
ASHLEY: Can I heal Grog?

2627
02:48:05,387 --> 02:48:07,215
MATT: Are you going to step up?

2628
02:48:07,215 --> 02:48:08,467
ASHLEY: I can see him.

2629
02:48:08,467 --> 02:48:09,565
MATT: You can see him, yeah.

2630
02:48:09,565 --> 02:48:11,044
ASHLEY: So I'm going to cast Heal on him.

2631
02:48:11,044 --> 02:48:12,362
MATT: You're going to cast Heal?

2632
02:48:12,362 --> 02:48:13,163
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2633
02:48:13,163 --> 02:48:19,550
MATT: As you begin to go for your holy symbol, you
can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for

2634
02:48:19,550 --> 02:48:20,641
their weapons.

2635
02:48:20,641 --> 02:48:28,709
TRAVIS: Hold! It is not necessary. Brothers, look
me in the eye. Has the taste of food lost its

2636
02:48:28,709 --> 02:48:37,991
appeal? Has the zest for life fallen from your
hearts? Living in this domesticated dwelling. I

2637
02:48:37,991 --> 02:48:47,645
promise you this: hear me, and I promise you
adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd.

2638
02:48:47,645 --> 02:48:52,837
MATT: The door slams open from the front of the
Margrave's home. You see as the two individuals

2639
02:48:52,837 --> 02:49:00,117
come out with chains over their shoulders as they
drag out into the center two individuals. You see

2640
02:49:00,117 --> 02:49:07,176
another half-giant goliath man, one that you've
all seen once before on your way to Kraghammer

2641
02:49:07,176 --> 02:49:19,402
months and months ago. Well. Yeah, about. You see
him swollen in the face, bruised, and in shackles,

2642
02:49:19,402 --> 02:49:26,061
dragged out and thrown to the ground. And the
other one holds over his shoulder another chain.

2643
02:49:26,061 --> 02:49:33,599
He pulls out behind him a half-giant woman with
the hair on the sides of her head shaved, one

2644
02:49:33,599 --> 02:49:41,654
single long mane of hair, and it looks like she's
with child. Also in shackles. And she's pushed to

2645
02:49:41,654 --> 02:49:51,741
the ground with Zanror. Zanror looks up and you
can see him closing his eyes like the daylight

2646
02:49:51,741 --> 02:50:02,880
itself is very bright and he probably hasn't seen
light in a period of time. "Strongjaw."

2647
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:06,237
TRAVIS: Cousin.

2648
02:50:06,313 --> 02:50:11,966
MATT: "Well. This is a surprise."

2649
02:50:11,966 --> 02:50:18,235
TRAVIS: Your face seems a little different.

2650
02:50:18,235 --> 02:50:22,018
MATT: It's at this moment that he looks over and
glances, and can see the body of Kevdak on the

2651
02:50:22,018 --> 02:50:27,703
ground for the first time, and then he goes, "You
did this?"

2652
02:50:27,703 --> 02:50:32,082
TRAVIS: Scanlan. Lower me down.

2653
02:50:32,082 --> 02:50:38,992
SAM: I swoop him down. Do you want to be on the
ground or just above it?

2654
02:50:38,992 --> 02:50:40,178
TRAVIS: On the ground.

2655
02:50:40,178 --> 02:50:47,789
SAM: On the ground. But I release him and I make a
fist that clenches right next to him. Just in case

2656
02:50:47,789 --> 02:50:49,495
anything goes bad.

2657
02:50:49,495 --> 02:50:56,698
MATT: So. As you're brought down to the ground,
Bigby's Hand sets you gently on the cobblestone.

2658
02:50:56,698 --> 02:51:09,772
TRAVIS: I take a few steps forward. Yes. This my
work. A debt fulfilled after many, many years.

2659
02:51:09,772 --> 02:51:31,857
MATT: (sighs) "I fear the Herd's lost its edge.
Priorities. My father had grown docile in this

2660
02:51:31,857 --> 02:51:38,381
"place. But he wouldn't be if whispers hadn't found
his ears." And he looks over at Greenbeard.

2661
02:51:38,381 --> 02:51:47,864
Greenbeard immediately steps back and goes, "Look
at him in shackles. This isn't a warrior, this is

2662
02:51:47,864 --> 02:51:51,772
"a slave. Both of 'em." Spits in their direction.

2663
02:51:51,772 --> 02:52:01,387
TRAVIS: Strange. I would ask, why is he in
shackles? What did Zanror do that would draw this

2664
02:52:01,387 --> 02:52:04,101
sort of ire from the Herd?

2665
02:52:04,101 --> 02:52:09,284
MATT: The one that's holding the chains on Zanror
pulls them a little tighter and Zanror's lifted up

2666
02:52:09,284 --> 02:52:13,430
a little bit off of his leaning-forward position,
he's now on his knees and his arms are pulled up,

2667
02:52:13,430 --> 02:52:27,781
in towards his torso. And Greenbeard looks back
towards you. "This skyshield here spoke against his

2668
02:52:27,781 --> 02:52:34,285
"father. He was attempting some sort of a mutiny.
But we quelled that right quick. Gave him time to

2669
02:52:34,285 --> 02:52:42,980
"think about it. His father was deciding what to do
with this traitor. And his next of kin. You,

2670
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:50,010
"however, seemingly stopped his trial, so I think
it's only fitting that you do the honors of

2671
02:52:50,010 --> 02:52:57,404
"finishing the job." And you can see as you were
lifted off the ground and everything, you did not

2672
02:52:57,404 --> 02:53:04,894
have your weapon with you, as you were on the
ground, lifted up. Greenbeard steps over and takes

2673
02:53:04,894 --> 02:53:10,420
the bloodaxe from the ground, walks up to you, and
hands it out, and looks over to Zanror.

2674
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:22,492
TRAVIS: I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a
glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well.

2675
02:53:22,492 --> 02:53:33,080
MATT: "Let it be." And two of the other
individuals, one of the half-orc individuals looks

2676
02:53:33,080 --> 02:53:37,862
over, hushed, and starts backing away from this,
this is too much for him. There's now this tribal

2677
02:53:37,862 --> 02:53:42,234
tension, this cultural tension that only exists
within the initial Herd and has been only recently

2678
02:53:42,234 --> 02:53:49,974
adopted by the Rivermaw that were absorbed by the
Herd and are still confused by this. Two of the

2679
02:53:49,974 --> 02:53:56,151
goliaths step over and pull and pry out the
somewhat soggy leftover arm of Kevdak.

2680
02:53:56,151 --> 02:53:59,358
LAURA: Kind of like when you're eating lobster, to
get the claw out, yeah.

2681
02:53:59,358 --> 02:54:02,853
LIAM: Shrinks as it leaves.

2682
02:54:02,853 --> 02:54:04,161
MATT: They toss it to the ground before you.

2683
02:54:04,161 --> 02:54:07,473
TRAVIS: I stand. Put on the gauntlets.

2684
02:54:07,473 --> 02:54:10,650
MATT: Kevdak at this point is still being held up
by the chains and says--

2685
02:54:10,650 --> 02:54:12,255
TRAVIS: Zanror.

2686
02:54:12,255 --> 02:54:21,137
MATT: Sorry, Zanror. Thank you. "It was
unbefitting of us all to be living under one of

2687
02:54:21,137 --> 02:54:28,474
"those beasts. Under my rule, we were going to take
back our power as a people."

2688
02:54:28,474 --> 02:54:37,381
TRAVIS: Quiet yourself. I've heard enough. And I
lift the bloodaxe and I say: you are a disgrace to

2689
02:54:37,381 --> 02:54:41,465
this herd and I will return this herd to power.

2690
02:54:41,465 --> 02:54:47,021
And I pivot, and I drive the bloodaxe into
Greenbeard.

2691
02:54:47,021 --> 02:54:49,090
MATT: Oh shit! Roll an attack.

2692
02:54:49,090 --> 02:54:50,776
TALIESIN: Yeah you do, buddy.

2693
02:54:50,776 --> 02:54:51,835
TRAVIS: Reckless?

2694
02:54:51,835 --> 02:54:53,351
MATT: If you want to.

2695
02:54:53,351 --> 02:54:57,568
LAURA: No!

2696
02:54:57,568 --> 02:54:58,898
ASHLEY: Get the fuck out!

2697
02:54:58,898 --> 02:55:01,340
LAURA: It's a fucking natural 20.

2698
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:02,441
MATT: Roll damage.

2699
02:55:02,441 --> 02:55:04,844
SAM: We're going to have to get these dice
calibrated later.

2700
02:55:04,844 --> 02:55:07,619
LAURA: But why does it only happen when it's a
story element?

2701
02:55:07,619 --> 02:55:08,979
TRAVIS: That's an 11.

2702
02:55:08,979 --> 02:55:11,785
MATT: Watch as next week Critical Role implements
dice cam.

2703
02:55:11,785 --> 02:55:13,187
(laughter)

2704
02:55:13,187 --> 02:55:14,824
MATT: No, that's awesome.

2705
02:55:14,824 --> 02:55:16,320
LAURA: Oh, let me take a picture, I'll take a
picture.

2706
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:17,408
TRAVIS: So that's 15.

2707
02:55:17,408 --> 02:55:18,349
MATT: All right.

2708
02:55:18,349 --> 02:55:19,563
TRAVIS: And then two more?

2709
02:55:19,563 --> 02:55:20,891
MATT: Two more, yeah.

2710
02:55:20,891 --> 02:55:24,982
TALIESIN: Watch next week as we fail to open the
door to his house for an hour and a half.

2711
02:55:24,982 --> 02:55:29,324
MARISHA: Yeah, yes, can't roll above a five next
week.

2712
02:55:29,324 --> 02:55:30,804
TRAVIS: That's 27. 37.

2713
02:55:30,804 --> 02:55:32,656
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2714
02:55:32,656 --> 02:55:34,038
SAM: Oh, you got it?

2715
02:55:34,038 --> 02:55:36,172
MATT: (laughs) He had taken a shit-ton of damage
in the battle, and was already moving by--

2716
02:55:36,172 --> 02:55:37,495
TALIESIN: Yeah, he was pretty low.

2717
02:55:37,495 --> 02:55:39,178
MATT: He had like 12 more hit points left, so.

2718
02:55:39,178 --> 02:55:43,519
TRAVIS: It seems all the poison came from his
head, so I'll remove that from his body.

2719
02:55:43,519 --> 02:55:50,033
MATT: And with that moment, (swishing), with a
very slick snapping sound, the blade coasts

2720
02:55:50,033 --> 02:55:55,653
through and the neck retreats as the head
continues forward and tumbles to the feet as

2721
02:55:55,653 --> 02:56:01,164
Greenbeard's body takes an instinctual step
backward and then falls, lifeless, in the center

2722
02:56:01,164 --> 02:56:05,758
of the marketplace. All the rest of the Herd moves
for a second, nervously.

2723
02:56:05,758 --> 02:56:12,449
TRAVIS: I spin and I say: do you see? Do you see
what staying in one place does? This is what

2724
02:56:12,449 --> 02:56:20,250
weakness looks like. I would return you to the
wild. I would return you to power. But you will

2725
02:56:20,250 --> 02:56:29,346
have to do it under this goliath's rule. Unchain
Zanror.

2726
02:56:29,346 --> 02:56:32,073
SAM: I point Bigby's Hand like he was too.

2727
02:56:32,073 --> 02:56:34,106
(laughter)

2728
02:56:34,106 --> 02:56:42,659
MATT: As Bigby's hand points to Zanror, the two
that are holding the chains move up and begin to

2729
02:56:42,659 --> 02:56:46,921
unchain them both, taking the shackles off his
hands and the female goliath at his side.

2730
02:56:46,921 --> 02:56:52,433
Eventually he stands up, reaches over and puts his
arm around her and says, "I am sorry, Worra."

2731
02:56:52,433 --> 02:56:54,765
TRAVIS: Worra.

2732
02:56:54,765 --> 02:57:03,295
MATT: Worra. She stands and goes, "Do not be
sorry. It seems we've been delivered from our

2733
02:57:03,295 --> 02:57:06,121
"judgment." She looks up towards you. You don't
recognize her.

2734
02:57:06,121 --> 02:57:07,987
TRAVIS: I don't.

2735
02:57:07,987 --> 02:57:11,445
MATT: She's not from the original Herd.

2736
02:57:11,445 --> 02:57:19,197
TRAVIS: Zanror, she is quite a beauty.
Congratulations.

2737
02:57:19,197 --> 02:57:31,401
MATT: "You saved us narrowly being executed,
Grog." And he stands up and gets to the front of

2738
02:57:31,401 --> 02:57:46,212
all the rest of the Herd there. "Call forth the
rest of our people. We do not leave this town yet.

2739
02:57:46,212 --> 02:58:00,279
"We claim Westruun home for one more night. For it
is tomorrow at dawn, we slam our blades against

2740
02:58:00,279 --> 02:58:02,327
"the hide of a dragon."

2741
02:58:02,327 --> 02:58:19,870
TRAVIS: No. This is honor. This is pride. This is
a life worth living.

2742
02:58:19,870 --> 02:58:29,341
MATT: "Will you join us in this glory and pride,
fair cousin Grog? You have proven yourself worthy

2743
02:58:29,341 --> 02:58:35,536
"of life and respect and the might of the Herd of
Storms."

2744
02:58:35,536 --> 02:58:38,745
TRAVIS: How many do you number?

2745
02:58:38,745 --> 02:58:43,239
MATT: He looks about and takes in the mental math
of all the people that were killed.

2746
02:58:43,239 --> 02:58:47,049
MARISHA: Yeah, we didn't kill that many.

2747
02:58:47,049 --> 02:58:54,779
MATT: I know, you took a few down. "We'd stand,
between the people that were loyal to me and my

2748
02:58:54,779 --> 02:59:00,928
"father, a good 43 men strong."

2749
02:59:00,928 --> 02:59:06,899
TRAVIS: More than we need. And I grab my earpiece
and I go, (meekly) thoughts?

2750
02:59:06,899 --> 02:59:08,824
(laughter)

2751
02:59:08,824 --> 02:59:13,795
SAM: I mean, we have a busy day tomorrow already,
I don't know if we should add dragons to it.

2752
02:59:13,795 --> 02:59:15,903
TALIESIN: We're hunting another dragon.

2753
02:59:15,903 --> 02:59:18,253
SAM: Just say yes, we can always leave in the dead
of night.

2754
02:59:18,253 --> 02:59:27,125
TRAVIS: All right. All this bloodshed is giving me
a terrible itch in my ear. We shall stay with you

2755
02:59:27,125 --> 02:59:34,332
and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a
dragon.

2756
02:59:34,332 --> 02:59:38,841
MATT: He steps forward to you now, there's a
slight limp to his walk, but there's too much

2757
02:59:38,841 --> 02:59:43,827
pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches
out his hands to you and clasps it in his own,

2758
02:59:43,827 --> 02:59:47,133
Beastmaster-style, holding onto it.

2759
02:59:47,133 --> 02:59:48,819
TRAVIS: Yeah, strength and honor!

2760
02:59:48,819 --> 02:59:52,900
MATT: "For the dragons, it shall be."

2761
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:54,681
TRAVIS: It shall be.

2762
02:59:54,681 --> 03:00:03,430
MATT: He releases the grasp. "Let them walk
amongst us as brethren. Come. We have much

2763
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:11,436
"preparation to do." And he goes back to Worra and
limps into her arms, and she takes him up and it's

2764
03:00:11,436 --> 03:00:15,947
her strength now lifting him on his feet. And the
two begin to make their way across the rest of the

2765
03:00:15,947 --> 03:00:21,945
center of town. All the rest of them take their
weapons and they relax, and they still keep a very

2766
03:00:21,945 --> 03:00:27,893
wary eye of you. The words have been said and
there is still this tenuous truce, but they're

2767
03:00:27,893 --> 03:00:32,075
still coming off the cusp of adrenaline, warfare,
and the slaughtering of their previous leader.

2768
03:00:32,075 --> 03:00:36,340
However, they are going along with the words that
were spoken, and there is a look of general fear

2769
03:00:36,340 --> 03:00:42,401
and respect in their eyes, guarded as it may be.
What do you guys want to do?

2770
03:00:42,401 --> 03:00:47,133
LIAM: I would like to sever the remaining gristle
away from his arm that's holding the gauntlet on.

2771
03:00:47,133 --> 03:00:51,915
MATT: The gauntlets have been retrieved. And given
to Grog, yeah.

2772
03:00:51,915 --> 03:00:55,426
LIAM: Then I would like to loot Greenbeard's
body.

2773
03:00:55,426 --> 03:00:59,574
TRAVIS: Could you do me a favor? Could you butcher
me a skull of Kevdak, please?

2774
03:00:59,574 --> 03:01:00,722
LIAM: Yeah.

2775
03:01:00,722 --> 03:01:03,833
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to land.

2776
03:01:03,833 --> 03:01:06,751
MATT: You're going to land, all right.

2777
03:01:06,751 --> 03:01:08,549
LAURA: And I'm going to call Trinket out.

2778
03:01:08,549 --> 03:01:12,146
MATT: Trinket, who's been hiding in the back room
there.

2779
03:01:12,146 --> 03:01:14,138
LAURA: Because things happened so fast for him!

2780
03:01:14,138 --> 03:01:15,227
MATT: They did happen.

2781
03:01:15,227 --> 03:01:16,652
LAURA: And there were really strong people!

2782
03:01:16,652 --> 03:01:20,273
ASHLEY: And I got to go over and heal, yeah.
Already healed him.

2783
03:01:20,273 --> 03:01:23,627
SAM: I'm going to go over-- are there any remains
of the little boy?

2784
03:01:23,627 --> 03:01:25,172
MATT: Yeah.

2785
03:01:25,172 --> 03:01:33,575
SAM: Do you have anything that can heal the little
boy or bring him back somehow, Pike? Key?

2786
03:01:33,575 --> 03:01:34,606
Anything?

2787
03:01:34,606 --> 03:01:38,448
MARISHA: I go and check the little boy. How bad is
he? Is he beyond the point of return?

2788
03:01:38,448 --> 03:01:39,855
MATT: He's done.

2789
03:01:39,855 --> 03:01:41,099
ASHLEY: Could I--

2790
03:01:41,099 --> 03:01:42,993
SAM: Resurrect him or something?

2791
03:01:42,993 --> 03:01:46,031
ASHLEY: I have Raise Dead.

2792
03:01:46,031 --> 03:01:47,430
MATT: Do you?

2793
03:01:47,430 --> 03:01:49,890
LAURA: Does it turn him into a zombie, or does
it--

2794
03:01:49,890 --> 03:01:51,556
MATT: No, it just raises him from the dead.

2795
03:01:51,556 --> 03:01:53,039
LAURA: Okay, yeah, do that.

2796
03:01:53,039 --> 03:01:57,722
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll go over to the little boy and
see if I can--

2797
03:01:57,722 --> 03:02:02,475
MATT: Okay, this will take a while. All right. So,
as the rest of herd move on, following Zanror,

2798
03:02:02,475 --> 03:02:06,242
they begin to separate to gather the rest of the
herd throughout the town. A few stay behind, keeping watch--

2799
03:02:06,242 --> 03:02:09,624
MARISHA: I'll assist Pike in any way that I can.

2800
03:02:09,624 --> 03:02:10,530
MATT: Okay.

2801
03:02:10,530 --> 03:02:12,164
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and fix my gun.

2802
03:02:12,164 --> 03:02:19,665
MATT: It's going to cost-- 500 gold are consumed
by the casting of this spell as part of the--

2803
03:02:19,665 --> 03:02:21,309
LAURA: I'll help.

2804
03:02:21,309 --> 03:02:32,314
MATT: Okay. Takes an hour. So, as you guys take
this time, this is a short rest for those of you

2805
03:02:32,314 --> 03:02:37,479
who aren't part of this ritual. You complete the
ritual. Go ahead and make a religion check.

2806
03:02:37,479 --> 03:02:42,994
LAURA: Hey, you already boxed up your stuff.

2807
03:02:42,994 --> 03:02:45,914
MATT: She was like, I'm done, I'm out. Peace.

2808
03:02:45,914 --> 03:02:47,362
ASHLEY: 20?

2809
03:02:47,362 --> 03:02:48,990
MATT: d20, add your religion.

2810
03:02:48,990 --> 03:02:50,992
LAURA: That's good.

2811
03:02:50,992 --> 03:02:57,556
ASHLEY: 24.

2812
03:02:57,556 --> 03:03:01,598
MATT: Okay. Vex, you said you wanted to help. What
did you want to help with the ritual on?

2813
03:03:01,598 --> 03:03:03,532
MARISHA: No, I said I wanted to help.

2814
03:03:03,532 --> 03:03:05,524
LAURA: She was assisting. I was helping with the
money.

2815
03:03:05,524 --> 03:03:10,117
MATT: Right, sorry, helping with the money. How
are you aiding with the ritual?

2816
03:03:10,117 --> 03:03:12,398
MARISHA: What? How am I aiding with the ritual?

2817
03:03:12,398 --> 03:03:13,399
MATT: Yes.

2818
03:03:13,399 --> 03:03:14,500
MARISHA: What were you doing?

2819
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:17,415
MATT: Well, she was casting-- she was preparing
the ritual, preparing seals and taking out the

2820
03:03:17,415 --> 03:03:22,907
components and praying to Sarenrae and speaking
the rites, which channel through her in Celestial

2821
03:03:22,907 --> 03:03:26,038
language. Although she doesn't understand
Celestial, she speaks it through as part of the

2822
03:03:26,038 --> 03:03:27,158
spell, almost like--

2823
03:03:27,158 --> 03:03:28,343
TALIESIN: I speak Celestial.

2824
03:03:28,343 --> 03:03:31,323
MARISHA: I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I
keep getting that confused.

2825
03:03:31,323 --> 03:03:33,256
MATT: Yep. How are you aiding in this?

2826
03:03:33,256 --> 03:03:42,265
MARISHA: Can place my hand on his chest and place
my other hand on the ground and try and use

2827
03:03:42,265 --> 03:03:45,685
natural healing to assist?

2828
03:03:45,685 --> 03:03:51,458
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a straight wisdom
roll.

2829
03:03:51,458 --> 03:03:54,353
MARISHA: Natural one.

2830
03:03:54,353 --> 03:03:55,486
MATT: Okay.

2831
03:03:55,486 --> 03:03:56,744
TALIESIN: Can I assist?

2832
03:03:56,744 --> 03:03:57,868
MATT: How would you like to assist?

2833
03:03:57,868 --> 03:04:00,738
TALIESIN: I would like to come over and start
listening to the chanting that she's doing in

2834
03:04:00,738 --> 03:04:04,771
Celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it
since I can actually speak Celestial.

2835
03:04:04,771 --> 03:04:06,768
MATT: Roll a performance check.

2836
03:04:06,768 --> 03:04:08,062
SAM: Performance.

2837
03:04:08,062 --> 03:04:09,332
LAURA: That's lovely.

2838
03:04:09,332 --> 03:04:12,120
TALIESIN: 21.

2839
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:18,749
MATT: All right. As you finish the ritual, both
the voices of Pike and Percy begin to harmonize

2840
03:04:18,749 --> 03:04:24,862
across these various refrains in a language that,
especially when spoken in this rhythmic,

2841
03:04:24,862 --> 03:04:29,166
ritualistic way, it seems to almost create a third
voice. And then you hear, clearly, there is a

2842
03:04:29,166 --> 03:04:32,840
third voice harmonizing with them that you don't
know where it's coming from.

2843
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:38,536
SAM: It's me. I'm off here in the corner. (sings
scat)

2844
03:04:38,536 --> 03:04:45,942
MATT: As the beautiful musical tones of the
singing come to a close, your holy symbol, the

2845
03:04:45,942 --> 03:04:53,504
glow fades, and a moment passes before you hear
the soft coughing of the child's throaty

2846
03:04:53,504 --> 03:05:01,419
expulsion, himself taking in his next breath of
air. He sits up, cradling his head.

2847
03:05:01,419 --> 03:05:03,368
"What happened?"

2848
03:05:03,368 --> 03:05:07,711
MARISHA: It's okay. I dump a Cure Wounds in him
now.

2849
03:05:07,711 --> 03:05:09,656
MATT: It's okay!

2850
03:05:09,656 --> 03:05:11,538
(laughter)

2851
03:05:11,538 --> 03:05:14,485
MARISHA: Not a potion! I cast Cure Wounds.

2852
03:05:14,485 --> 03:05:15,780
MATT: Okay, okay.

2853
03:05:15,780 --> 03:05:17,051
TALIESIN: Take it, take it!

2854
03:05:17,051 --> 03:05:18,885
MATT: He's like, (choking sounds).

2855
03:05:18,885 --> 03:05:25,335
LAURA: I cast Grasping Vine and lift him up by the
neck.

2856
03:05:25,335 --> 03:05:26,657
LIAM: Shot right in the chest.

2857
03:05:26,657 --> 03:05:32,317
TALIESIN: Six years of Celestial, and when are you
ever going to use it? It finally pays off.

2858
03:05:32,317 --> 03:05:36,187
ASHLEY: Thanks for helping, Percy.

2859
03:05:36,187 --> 03:05:37,698
TALIESIN: That was lovely, thank you.

2860
03:05:37,698 --> 03:05:42,200
MATT: All right. So the child is brought back to
life, healed, confused, dazed, but not really

2861
03:05:42,200 --> 03:05:44,505
understanding the circumstances around him, just
happy to--

2862
03:05:44,505 --> 03:05:46,176
MARISHA: He heals 24 hit points.

2863
03:05:46,176 --> 03:05:50,796
MATT: Yeah, he's good to go. His wounds close, the
dried blood's still there, but he seems to be in

2864
03:05:50,796 --> 03:05:55,287
perfect health at the moment, although a little
weak and worse for wear.

2865
03:05:55,287 --> 03:05:56,995
LAURA: Where's your mother, child?

2866
03:05:56,995 --> 03:05:58,789
MATT: "I don't know."

2867
03:05:58,789 --> 03:06:00,450
LAURA: Was she here in the square with you?

2868
03:06:00,450 --> 03:06:08,153
MATT: "No, everything went by so fast. They tried
to pull them out, but they found me and pulled me

2869
03:06:08,153 --> 03:06:13,610
"out and brought me here. That's all. There was a
fight and a lot of yelling. That's all I remember."

2870
03:06:13,610 --> 03:06:15,139
ASHLEY: Where do you live?

2871
03:06:15,139 --> 03:06:17,735
MATT: "Up by the temples."

2872
03:06:17,735 --> 03:06:25,889
LAURA: Okay. Well, we'll help you find your
family. And maybe while we're there we can see if

2873
03:06:25,889 --> 03:06:27,971
your grandfather's around.

2874
03:06:27,971 --> 03:06:36,171
MATT: He smiles a little bit. You can still see
the dried blood streaks across his face, but you

2875
03:06:36,171 --> 03:06:40,650
can see past that to the smile that peeks through
beneath his dirty face.

2876
03:06:40,650 --> 03:06:43,833
LAURA: I lift him up and put him on Trinket so we
can start walking.

2877
03:06:43,833 --> 03:06:48,749
MATT: Okay. He laughs and Trinket licks him and
takes some of that off and he is excited to be

2878
03:06:48,749 --> 03:06:53,592
grasping something, although he slides a couple
times. You can see he's weak from the remnants of

2879
03:06:53,592 --> 03:06:54,884
the resurrection spell.

2880
03:06:54,884 --> 03:06:56,352
MARISHA: I give him a boost.

2881
03:06:56,352 --> 03:06:59,142
MATT: Okay. Anybody else doing anything for the
short rest?

2882
03:06:59,142 --> 03:07:07,064
TRAVIS: I would like to not only remove Kevdak's
head, just the upper part, no jaw, just the skull,

2883
03:07:07,064 --> 03:07:14,241
and I would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the
skin around the bear tattoo off.

2884
03:07:14,241 --> 03:07:18,704
LAURA: Is there anything else to loot off of
Kevdak?

2885
03:07:18,704 --> 03:07:22,942
MATT: I mean, there is the bloodaxe, there is
the--

2886
03:07:22,942 --> 03:07:24,165
LAURA: Gauntlets?

2887
03:07:24,165 --> 03:07:30,666
MATT: The gauntlets, and he has four plus-one
enchanted javelins that he did not have an

2888
03:07:30,666 --> 03:07:32,281
opportunity to use this battle.

2889
03:07:32,281 --> 03:07:35,186
LAURA: (sings) Bag of Holding!

2890
03:07:35,186 --> 03:07:37,216
LIAM: I already called Greenbeard.

2891
03:07:37,216 --> 03:07:45,045
TRAVIS: I'll take the plus-one javelins. And I'd
like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag.

2892
03:07:45,045 --> 03:07:48,425
MATT: So mark that, mark down in your refrigerated
bag, flayed bear tattoo of Kevdak.

2893
03:07:48,425 --> 03:07:50,287
LAURA: Flayed bear tattoo. Got it.

2894
03:07:50,287 --> 03:07:56,152
MATT: That's disgusting. General leather armor,
quarterstaff. You do find one potion of greater

2895
03:07:56,152 --> 03:07:58,013
healing he did not have the opportunity to try.

2896
03:07:58,013 --> 03:08:00,768
LAURA: Nice. I'm putting that down.

2897
03:08:00,768 --> 03:08:02,342
MATT: That's all he has on him.

2898
03:08:02,342 --> 03:08:07,888
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to spend the rest of the
time that they did that ritual gathering up the

2899
03:08:07,888 --> 03:08:09,509
bodies, the remains.

2900
03:08:09,509 --> 03:08:10,846
TALIESIN: I'm going to fix my gun.

2901
03:08:10,846 --> 03:08:12,492
MATT: Okay. Make a tinkering check.

2902
03:08:12,492 --> 03:08:19,413
TALIESIN: Just barely. By one point. Did not
break.

2903
03:08:19,413 --> 03:08:21,742
MATT: Good. All right.

2904
03:08:21,742 --> 03:08:22,958
LIAM: I'm going to start a fire--

2905
03:08:22,958 --> 03:08:25,499
MATT: There's already a fire going.

2906
03:08:25,499 --> 03:08:26,404
LIAM: Is it?

2907
03:08:26,404 --> 03:08:29,910
MATT: Well, it's slower-burning embers now. One of
the barricades that had been set fire by the

2908
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:30,960
Fireball earlier.

2909
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:33,645
LIAM: I'll stoke it, and then put the bodies on.

2910
03:08:33,645 --> 03:08:39,442
MATT: Okay, so you take the bodies of the dead
villagers that had been lost in the battle and the

2911
03:08:39,442 --> 03:08:44,723
handful of the other combatants that had fallen,
and you throw them onto the fire and it crackles

2912
03:08:44,723 --> 03:08:49,175
and burns over time. The smell of burning bodies
fills the space around it for a while.

2913
03:08:49,175 --> 03:08:55,715
TALIESIN: We have a house to procure some items
from. And a conversation to have with Zanror at

2914
03:08:55,715 --> 03:08:56,712
some point.

2915
03:08:56,712 --> 03:08:58,289
SAM: What time of day is it now?

2916
03:08:58,289 --> 03:09:02,076
TRAVIS: Are there any other goliaths in the square
that are lingering?

2917
03:09:02,076 --> 03:09:06,679
MATT: There are three lingering that are keeping
an eye.

2918
03:09:06,679 --> 03:09:09,581
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to one?

2919
03:09:09,581 --> 03:09:11,511
MATT: Sure.

2920
03:09:11,511 --> 03:09:25,295
TRAVIS: Tonight we prepare for an incredible
battle. Go. Release any meager prisoners you may

2921
03:09:25,295 --> 03:09:28,742
have kept. They will do nothing for our fight.

2922
03:09:28,742 --> 03:09:40,163
MATT: "Very well. These two stay, though. No
offense, but you did just kill one of my friends

2923
03:09:40,163 --> 03:09:41,771
"naught but an hour ago."

2924
03:09:41,771 --> 03:09:44,366
TRAVIS: I did. And your claim is fair.

2925
03:09:44,366 --> 03:09:45,772
TALIESIN: These two?

2926
03:09:45,772 --> 03:09:47,482
LAURA: Who's these two?

2927
03:09:47,482 --> 03:09:51,526
MATT: There were three Herd members that were
keeping an eye--

2928
03:09:51,526 --> 03:09:52,714
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2929
03:09:52,714 --> 03:09:59,140
MATT: Two of them are goliaths. One of them is
human. The human and the other goliath stay

2930
03:09:59,140 --> 03:10:04,936
behind. The one you talked to walks off and seems
to be following through on what you told him to do.

2931
03:10:04,936 --> 03:10:10,314
TALIESIN: Is it Lord Zanror, by the way? I may
request an audience with Lord Zanror at some

2932
03:10:10,314 --> 03:10:12,305
point. With your supervision.

2933
03:10:12,305 --> 03:10:14,915
TRAVIS: Yeah. Have at it.

2934
03:10:14,915 --> 03:10:17,155
MATT: Now Thunderlord Zanror.

2935
03:10:17,155 --> 03:10:22,889
TRAVIS: Yeah, Thunderlord! I say that in my head.

2936
03:10:22,889 --> 03:10:26,621
SAM: We have Pike's dad to find, we've got a house
to loot--

2937
03:10:26,621 --> 03:10:29,252
MARISHA: We've got a child to deliver home.

2938
03:10:29,252 --> 03:10:31,553
MATT: Did you want to look over the items you
found on Kevdak?

2939
03:10:31,553 --> 03:10:33,300
TRAVIS: Oh fucking shit, yes, may I please?

2940
03:10:33,300 --> 03:10:40,088
TALIESIN: And a unique opportunity to maybe really
fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart.

2941
03:10:40,088 --> 03:10:42,799
MATT: There's your bloodaxe. And there's your
Titanstone Knuckles.

2942
03:10:42,799 --> 03:10:46,289
LAURA: (laughs) Bowing down like he's been
knighted.

2943
03:10:46,289 --> 03:10:53,555
TALIESIN: Hm? We have a dragon who's going to go
pick up a giant package of whatever we give him.

2944
03:10:53,555 --> 03:10:55,091
LAURA: Oh shit, you're right.

2945
03:10:55,091 --> 03:10:58,112
TALIESIN: We could make some interesting decisions
on what's in that box.

2946
03:10:58,112 --> 03:11:02,959
MARISHA: That is an interesting point.

2947
03:11:02,959 --> 03:11:05,405
LAURA: I mean, do we have to stay in the square,
or are we allowed to?

2948
03:11:05,405 --> 03:11:08,843
MATT: No. Doesn't seem to be anything holding you
there other than the ritual that was done. When

2949
03:11:08,843 --> 03:11:13,852
the ritual's completed, you're welcome to go about
what you're doing. At which point you do see as

2950
03:11:13,852 --> 03:11:19,883
time has passed, a few people start poking through
windows, who apparently were either hiding in some

2951
03:11:19,883 --> 03:11:26,240
of these buildings, and see you guys and check out
and then go back into hiding again. The town still

2952
03:11:26,240 --> 03:11:30,518
has people living throughout it. Many of them stay
hidden whenever things move in their vicinity.

2953
03:11:30,518 --> 03:11:31,870
LAURA: Okay.

2954
03:11:31,870 --> 03:11:33,908
MATT: So.

2955
03:11:33,908 --> 03:11:38,765
SAM: What's our thing? Do we want to achieve
anything else tonight or just rest?

2956
03:11:38,765 --> 03:11:43,719
LAURA: I feel like we should return this little
boy to his family. And see if we can

2957
03:11:43,719 --> 03:11:45,244
find your grandpa.

2958
03:11:45,244 --> 03:11:46,964
LIAM: In the short term, we should be able to walk
freely, though.

2959
03:11:46,964 --> 03:11:56,190
MATT: All right. So, as you guys gather
yourselves, partially rested and breathing a sigh

2960
03:11:56,190 --> 03:12:01,541
of relief at the not horrible circumstance that
nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the

2961
03:12:01,541 --> 03:12:03,046
gods in a lot of cases.

2962
03:12:03,046 --> 03:12:05,268
LAURA: I can't believe we're not all dead.

2963
03:12:05,268 --> 03:12:11,499
MATT: You make your way northward through
Westruun, toward the temple district, small child

2964
03:12:11,499 --> 03:12:13,053
at your side with the intent--

2965
03:12:13,053 --> 03:12:14,064
LAURA: On Trinket.

2966
03:12:14,064 --> 03:12:22,359
MATT: On Trinket by your side. And possibly to
prepare for whatever the Herd has in store for

2967
03:12:22,359 --> 03:12:26,914
dawn. And with that, we'll finish tonight's game.

2968
03:12:26,914 --> 03:12:30,667
MARISHA: Now we're going to have to have another
huge conversation.

2969
03:12:30,667 --> 03:12:38,347
LAURA: We didn't die! I seriously thought we were
all going to die. When he got healed and

2970
03:12:38,347 --> 03:12:40,088
everything was running--

2971
03:12:40,088 --> 03:12:43,611
TRAVIS: Yup. Yup. I was like, we might as well
make it cool, because we're dead.

2972
03:12:43,611 --> 03:12:47,869
LIAM: We had it, then it flipped and it was gone.
And then we snaked it outta the fire.

2973
03:12:47,869 --> 03:12:49,560
MARISHA: But we had them on the run!

2974
03:12:49,560 --> 03:12:52,041
MATT: He, by the way, on that Hold Person, that
Cutting Words/Hold Person.

2975
03:12:52,041 --> 03:12:54,471
Like, that's exactly what that--

2976
03:12:54,471 --> 03:12:59,398
TRAVIS: Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking
bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina.

2977
03:12:59,398 --> 03:13:01,218
SAM: Oh yeah, appearing tomorrow.

2978
03:13:01,218 --> 03:13:06,334
MATT: Yeah, no. Kevdak hadn't used his action
surge yet.

2979
03:13:06,334 --> 03:13:08,286
MARISHA: What was that?

2980
03:13:08,286 --> 03:13:10,255
MATT: Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.

2981
03:13:10,255 --> 03:13:12,096
SAM: Action surge? What does that do?

2982
03:13:12,096 --> 03:13:13,652
MATT: Multi, it's what he does.

2983
03:13:13,652 --> 03:13:15,656
TALIESIN: What I do, where he can take an extra
action.

2984
03:13:15,656 --> 03:13:17,679
MATT: He can do four attacks in one round with the
bloodaxe.

2985
03:13:17,679 --> 03:13:19,084
SAM: Did he ever get to attack?

2986
03:13:19,084 --> 03:13:23,441
MATT: No. Couldn't make his save. His arms were
gone by the time he came around.

2987
03:13:23,441 --> 03:13:27,855
LAURA: Oh my god, getting his arms off him,
brilliant.

2988
03:13:27,855 --> 03:13:34,545
MATT: Plus, he had four more superiority die and
the riposte ability. So he could--

2989
03:13:34,545 --> 03:13:36,011
TRAVIS: What is riposte?

2990
03:13:36,011 --> 03:13:39,113
MATT: When a creature misses him with a melee
attack, he can use one of his superiority die to

2991
03:13:39,113 --> 03:13:42,415
do a reaction attack as well. So he could in
theory get five attacks in one round.

2992
03:13:42,415 --> 03:13:47,907
TRAVIS: Oh. Holy shit. That's that half-fighter
side, right?

2993
03:13:47,907 --> 03:13:49,399
TALIESIN: That's sexy.

2994
03:13:49,399 --> 03:13:53,086
MATT: Yeah, that Hold Person really changed the
dynamic really fast.

2995
03:13:53,086 --> 03:13:57,766
LIAM: We had a very heated discussion over the
earring in that 30 seconds, let me tell you.

2996
03:13:57,766 --> 03:14:00,191
TALIESIN: Well, we had that whole long walk. That
was the theory.

2997
03:14:00,191 --> 03:14:03,644
ASHLEY: I think that was the most stressful game
I've ever played.

2998
03:14:03,644 --> 03:14:05,062
LAURA: This was incredibly stressful.

2999
03:14:05,062 --> 03:14:07,890
SAM: Pike almost died, Grog died.

3000
03:14:07,890 --> 03:14:15,371
TALIESIN: I was about to be toast. Two more hits
from that guy and that would've been the end of me.

3001
03:14:15,371 --> 03:14:17,342
TRAVIS: That was fucking amazing.

3002
03:14:17,342 --> 03:14:20,048
MARISHA: That was a three-hour battle. We did
nothing but fight.

3003
03:14:20,048 --> 03:14:23,879
MATT: And honestly, mucking it up with the archers
helped too, because they were all about to start

3004
03:14:23,879 --> 03:14:25,954
focus-firing on whoever was visible.

3005
03:14:25,954 --> 03:14:30,448
LAURA: Yeah. So I'm glad we split them up. Getting
Grog out.

3006
03:14:30,448 --> 03:14:36,201
MATT: Getting Grog out was key. If you hadn't
pulled him out and taken all those attacks of

3007
03:14:36,201 --> 03:14:40,345
opportunity? You would be gone. They weren't going
to stop when you hit zero.

3008
03:14:40,345 --> 03:14:41,531
TRAVIS: No no, that would've been it.

3009
03:14:41,531 --> 03:14:43,201
MATT: They were going to cut you up until you were
dead.

3010
03:14:43,201 --> 03:14:44,409
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep.

3011
03:14:44,409 --> 03:14:45,714
LIAM: Look at that guy.

3012
03:14:45,714 --> 03:14:47,076
MATT: What?

3013
03:14:47,076 --> 03:14:50,361
TRAVIS: I know, look at the face, you saw it too,
didn't you? The shadow of a man that wished he

3014
03:14:50,361 --> 03:14:53,617
could have butchered somebody and didn't quite get
to.

3015
03:14:53,617 --> 03:14:55,349
(laughter)

3016
03:14:55,349 --> 03:14:58,129
TRAVIS: The shadow of Craven Edge lives behind
those eyes.

3017
03:14:58,129 --> 03:15:01,190
MATT: It's okay. Bunch of dudes. You guys have
dragons to deal with.

3018
03:15:01,190 --> 03:15:02,509
LAURA: Oh god.

3019
03:15:02,509 --> 03:15:08,974
MATT: All right, well, guys, thank you very much
for watching. Thanks again for Loot Crate for

3020
03:15:08,974 --> 03:15:10,906
being awesome and being our sponsor--

3021
03:15:10,906 --> 03:15:12,206
ALL: Thank you, Loot Crate!

3022
03:15:12,206 --> 03:15:14,452
MATT: If-- I dunno, if he's still around. Is our
guest still around?

3023
03:15:14,452 --> 03:15:15,927
LAURA: Is he?

3024
03:15:15,927 --> 03:15:18,074
SAM: No, there's no way.

3025
03:15:18,074 --> 03:15:22,960
TRAVIS: Why don't you mention the Loot Crate link
again?

3026
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:26,876
SAM: Oh yeah, we should flash up the Loot Crate
link and we'll be tweeting that out later.

3027
03:15:26,876 --> 03:15:31,695
MATT: Yeah, it's ww (stammers), www.Loot
Crate.com/criticalrole.

3028
03:15:31,695 --> 03:15:33,563
SAM: So that's five w's?

3029
03:15:33,563 --> 03:15:38,115
TALIESIN: And the code is "criticalrole", not
"critrole".

3030
03:15:38,115 --> 03:15:41,145
MATT: They didn't coordinate with Wyrmwood.

3031
03:15:41,145 --> 03:15:42,469
LIAM: Missed opportunity.

3032
03:15:42,469 --> 03:15:45,614
TALIESIN: I got Loot Crate for my little brother.
It's his nerd of the month club.

3033
03:15:45,614 --> 03:15:47,712
ASHLEY: It's the best. I have Loot Crate and it's
the best.

3034
03:15:47,712 --> 03:15:50,012
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a bash. Every time around we're
like, aha!

3035
03:15:50,012 --> 03:15:53,620
MARISHA: I know, it's like a little present to
yourself that you forgot you got.

3036
03:15:53,620 --> 03:16:00,288
TALIESIN: Also, anything I don't want, I put into
a big bin and, at Christmas, I am Santa Claus to

3037
03:16:00,288 --> 03:16:04,558
all the kids on the block. It's intense. They all
want to know what's up with me.

3038
03:16:04,558 --> 03:16:11,679
MATT: That's fantastic. All right. Well, in the
meantime, we'll be back next week to see what this

3039
03:16:11,679 --> 03:16:20,924
next chapter in the Westruun portion of this
adventure holds. Well done, guys. That's the

3040
03:16:20,924 --> 03:16:22,513
largest battlefield I've made so far.

3041
03:16:22,513 --> 03:16:24,463
SAM: That was an amazing battlefield.

3042
03:16:24,463 --> 03:16:26,317
LAURA: Good job, Matthew Mercer.

3043
03:16:26,317 --> 03:16:28,692
MARISHA: Thank you, Dwarven Forge!

3044
03:16:28,692 --> 03:16:31,895
MATT: Is he-- he's not here?

3045
03:16:31,895 --> 03:16:33,936
(groans of disappointment)

3046
03:16:33,936 --> 03:16:38,989
MATT: Well, we had the pleasure of having Patrick
Rothfuss in the office today to watch the game, so

3047
03:16:38,989 --> 03:16:42,792
wherever you are, Patrick, pleasure to meet you,
and maybe we'll drag you--

3048
03:16:42,792 --> 03:16:44,321
ASHLEY: Big fans, big fans.

3049
03:16:44,321 --> 03:16:50,261
MATT: Maybe we'll drag you on the show sometime.
Next time you're in LA. So, anyway guys, have a

3050
03:16:50,261 --> 03:16:54,189
wonderful evening, see you next week, and is it
Thursday yet?

3051
03:16:54,189 --> 03:16:57,298
(cheering)

3052
03:16:57,298 --> 03:19:27,675
