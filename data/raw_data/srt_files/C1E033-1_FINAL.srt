1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,858
MATT: So first and foremost, we'll get our
announcements out of the way as fast as possible.

2
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:11,342
First thing I want to announce, with a little help
from our resident gnome bard here today: Scanlan's

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:15,136
playlist on Spotify went up on the website. Do you
want to talk a little bit about that?

4
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:20,214
SAM: Go log on to GeekandSundry.com, slash "find
it on that site somewhere."

5
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:22,796
MARISHA: It's on the front page right now.

6
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:27,067
SAM: And you can find it on Spotify. There's some
cool songs on there.

7
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:30,308
TRAVIS: That's baby-making music right there,
baby.

8
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:34,827
SAM: Yeah. There's some panty peelers in there,
too.

9
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,286
LAURA: Oh god.

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,547
MATT: That's a terrible term.

11
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:41,517
SAM: I wrote it in the song description. Somebody
edited it out.

12
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,717
(laughter)

13
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:46,177
MARISHA: Oh no.

14
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:48,391
TALIESIN: Well.

15
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,912
MATT: Go check that out, guys.

16
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:52,419
LAURA: Go check that out, guys.

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,586
MATT: Exactly. It's actually a pretty great
playlist; I've been listening to it all afternoon

18
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:58,948
while prepping for this. By the way, it's really
interesting to write stuff for the current

19
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:01,620
scenario in Whitestone with some Marvin Gaye in
the background.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,417
TALIESIN: Are we going to feel that influence in
tonight's game?

21
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:14,396
MATT: I certainly hope not. Also, next cool
announcement: our first Critical Role comic came

22
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:24,921
out today. Our four glorious first panels starting
off the past adventure of the party in Westruun

23
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:30,199
for their first Winter's Crest Festival. So yeah,
there will be one four-panel comic coming out each

24
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:35,085
week to go through the six week run of this
storyline, written by our fantastic Taliesin Jaffe

25
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:39,317
and Marisha Ray over here, and drawn by the
incredible--

26
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,509
SAM: Sam Riegel.

27
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,601
MATT: No. (laughs) @WendyDoodles on Twitter. You
guys know her as Wendy. She's one of our official

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:51,061
artists. She's absolutely amazing. She's our
artist for this run. So show her some love.

29
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,358
LIAM: Endlessly charming.

30
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,462
LAURA: Yes, she is.

31
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:54,581
MATT: Very much so.

32
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,651
ZAC: Really quick announcement that I forgot to
put on the document. Hey, guys. We are still in

33
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,671
sub-only chat tonight, but we will be doing a
giveaway at the half if we reach the sub goal,

34
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:09,308
which is every 100, and I think we're 93 away from
the next one. So if we hit 11,500 before the half,

35
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:13,718
there will be a giveaway, and we will open that up
to everyone watching, not just subscribers only.

36
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,528
So anyone watching, don't fret. You still have a
chance to win stuff.

37
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,103
MATT: And what is in the giveaway?

38
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:25,924
ZAC: Tons of shit. Signed posters, D&amp;D stuff. It's
just a box of awesome shit.

39
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,980
TALIESIN: www.TonsOfShit.com

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,620
MARISHA: Don't look that up.

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,160
TALIESIN: Don't look that up. It's just going to
make you unhappy.

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,087
LIAM: We got a big fat care package from Kurtis
Wiebe, who is the writer of Rat Queens, so we have

43
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:42,953
collected volumes. I think the first volume or two
of Rat Queens. There's some t-shirts, so some of

44
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:45,694
that will probably be finding its way in.
Obviously, we love Rat Queens.

45
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:47,219
LAURA: Obviously.

46
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:54,209
MATT: We like to fill your care packages with tons
of cool shit. We throw random things in there for

47
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,679
you guys, as well. Cool random things, not just
random things.

48
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,315
MARISHA: It's like Critical Role's favorite
things.

49
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,650
MATT and LAURA: Yeah.

50
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,141
TALIESIN: We'll be putting out a catalog.

51
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:01,889
MARISHA: Yes.

52
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,091
TALIESIN: Critical Role's most favorite things.

53
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,593
MATT: Cool, so check out the comic strip.

54
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,352
ZAC: There is a fucking broom behind you.

55
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,512
MATT: There is a broom. Get that out of there.
There you go.

56
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:12,991
TRAVIS: It's because we're going to sweep these
Briarwoods under the carpet!

57
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,760
ALL: Whoa!

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,177
SAM: That was quick. Love that one.

59
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,582
MARISHA: So good.

60
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,790
MATT: Are you?

61
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,838
(laughter)

62
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,731
TALIESIN: I've got another character ready to roll
when this all goes down.

63
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:29,369
MARISHA: No! You can't have a plan B already.

64
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:30,903
LAURA: I don't have a plan B.

65
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,738
TALIESIN: Much like my parents, I have no plan B.

66
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:38,263
MATT: Laura, if you want to take this away, we
have some new merch, apparently, that just went up

67
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,251
in the store.

68
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:46,066
LAURA: Oh my goodness gracious! So yeah, starting
today, there will be a couple of Critmas hoodies

69
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,553
available in the Geek and Sundry store, so
Marisha, if you want to hold up one?

70
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:50,578
MARISHA: Ready?

71
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:55,268
LAURA: There's black and green. You guys should go
on the website and check it out, because all the

72
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,349
little details are freaking amazing.

73
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:58,959
TRAVIS: There's ugly Critmas sweaters.

74
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,772
LAURA: And these are designed by Kenneth.

75
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:03,523
TALIESIN: Yule poop! There's yule poop here.

76
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:08,162
SAM: Aw, there is, and it's singing!

77
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:14,036
LAURA: There's a little Trinket and there's Minxie.
And there's a Pepperbox shooting bullets

78
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,480
TALIESIN: And then there's arrows.

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,951
LAURA: And there's "dagger, dagger, dagger."

80
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:18,636
MARISHA: It's a Critmas sweater.

81
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,592
LIAM: I just tweeted out links to the store from
the @criticalrole twitter handle.

82
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:28,393
LAURA: So they're the coolest, and then I know
everybody was talking about how the "How Do You

83
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,855
Want to Do This?" shirts were sold out. Those will
be coming back very soon, and there is also "How

84
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,492
Do You Want to Do This?" mouse pads for those
people that don't want to wear anything and just

85
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,619
want to surf the web.

86
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,915
TRAVIS: Watch us, au naturel.

87
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,980
TALIESIN: I'm now wondering how much of our
audience is currently-- no, never mind.

88
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,205
SAM: Just wearing a mouse pad?

89
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,716
(laughter)

90
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,242
MATT: For those who don't know, I don't wear pants
during this show.

91
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:51,220
LAURA: We're like newscasters.

92
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,619
MATT: Exactly.

93
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,421
TALIESIN: He's so hairy, we hardly notice.

94
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,042
MATT: It's true, I'm like a satyr.

95
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:01,190
(laughter)

96
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,690
MARISHA: This is escalating quickly.

97
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,033
TALIESIN: I've got plastic on my character.

98
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,990
TRAVIS: A satyr! Draw that shit first.

99
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,646
(laughter)

100
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:13,257
MATT: No, damn it. Oh man. Yeah, we had a lot of
great feedback from people saying that shirts were

101
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,738
great, but we want to expand into other parts of
merchandise people were requesting, so we're

102
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:17,832
starting to do that.

103
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:21,446
LAURA: Yeah, there's some other cool things coming
up, too, but that's what's available now.

104
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,602
MATT: We've been trying to be creative to make
sure you guys have stuff if you want it,

105
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:25,963
especially for this season.

106
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:29,917
TALIESIN: Oh, and just to do it again since we
haven't done it enough, please do check out the

107
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:36,157
Spotify links and the comics. Go to the actual
Geek and Sundry website because the more traffic

108
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:42,461
the Geek and Sundry website gets for you guys
going there to look at our stuff, the more excited

109
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:46,823
they are to do cool stuff for us, so if you want
more of this, definitely go there.

110
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:50,817
LAURA: Well, also if you go to the website, then
you can see the blurbs that we wrote about each of

111
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,355
the songs and the explanations about why we chose
them.

112
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,808
MARISHA: We each picked fanart.

113
00:05:54,808 --> 00:06:00,123
SAM: What I do is I favorite the geekandsundry.com
website. I check it every morning when I wake up.

114
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,431
That's what I do. It's my news in the morning.

115
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:07,552
TRAVIS: I think I'll do that tomorrow morning.
That's a great idea. That's imitatable.

116
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:10,981
TALIESIN: We have so much stuff we want to do for
you guys. We have grand plans.

117
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:12,756
LAURA: Grand slam plans.

118
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,040
TALIESIN: Thank you, ma'am.

119
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,301
MARISHA: Thanks, Denny's.

120
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:20,979
MATT: All right, cool. Next up, just to remind you
guys, most of our actual show announcements and

121
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,809
stuff go up on our @criticalrole twitter handle,
and we have all our personal ones, but that's our

122
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:29,553
central place for all Critical Role-related
business and announcements, so if you don't

123
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:36,205
already follow that, you should because all our
cool stuff goes up on that. Also, today's

124
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:41,312
donations and our donations for a while are going
to be going towards a new charity, pushing towards

125
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:46,915
Doctors Without Borders, to help support people in
crisis around the world. It's a wonderful

126
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:51,016
organization. We're going to play a video with
information about it during the break today, but

127
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:56,945
in a world that is filled with a lot of
positivity, there are dark places and there are

128
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:02,441
dark things and people need aid, so we're hoping
to do what we can to try and give to those

129
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,747
circumstances, so check it out at the break and if
anyone who is able to help give to that,

130
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,078
please do so.

131
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,364
TRAVIS: Solid.

132
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:13,923
MATT: Let's see, a couple other announcements. We
will be off next week for Thanksgiving because all

133
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:18,684
of us have families to see, so there will be no
Critical Role next week, unfortunately. I think

134
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:22,129
we'll be doing-- are we doing a rebroadcast of
something?

135
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,099
ZAC: We'll probably do a rebroadcast of all the
episodes.

136
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:25,994
MATT: Okay.

137
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:27,133
LAURA: Like a marathon?

138
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,008
ZAC: Sure, why not.

139
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:34,349
MATT: Or just 24 hours of a close-up of a turkey.
A turkey I cooked, so undercooked. But yeah, so we

140
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,081
won't be here next Thursday, but we'll be thinking
of you lovingly in the process, and we'll be

141
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,875
returning the Thursday after that to continue the
story.

142
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,410
TALIESIN: You'll be DMing a game for your family,
I would assume.

143
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,778
(laughter)

144
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:54,311
MATT: No, it never ends. No, I'll be eating
copious amounts of pumpkin pie, probably.

145
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:57,574
LIAM: You are now Homer Simpson in hell with
donuts just going in.

146
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,372
(laughter)

147
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:09,122
MATT: More, more! Yeah, so there's that. Other
cool announcement, this week saw a video game

148
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,279
release of Star Wars: Battlefront.

149
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,475
TRAVIS: It's so good.

150
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,598
MATT: I haven't had a chance to play it yet,
because Fallout.

151
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,531
LAURA and MARISHA: Because Fallout.

152
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:22,164
MATT: But that's next on the list. But you can
hear both me and Marisha in Star Wars: Battlefront

153
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:23,478
as stormtroopers.

154
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,045
(cheering)

155
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:28,793
MATT: Both to kill you if you're rebels or to do
better if you're with the Empire.

156
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:34,675
MARISHA: This is the first time they're really
focusing on female stormtroopers,

157
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,302
so it's pretty cool.

158
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:40,400
MATT: I think it's rad. So apologies for being
yelled at by us.

159
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,844
Anything else you want to go over?

160
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:47,403
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sam. Put your hand up by your face.
Now high five me while I high five down on the

161
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,534
count of three. One.

162
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:49,693
SAM: Wait, do I go up or down?

163
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:54,000
TRAVIS: You're going straight down, straight up.
One, two, three (impact noise). Did it work?

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,015
SAM: Did it work?

165
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,603
TRAVIS: I've got to go lower. One, two, three
(impact noise).

166
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,015
SAM: Ah! So strong!

167
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,640
(laughter)

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,209
LAURA: I want to see if it works.

169
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,667
TRAVIS: You've got to wait 20 seconds.

170
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,021
(laughter)

171
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:17,500
LIAM: Switched over to PayPal. While he looks at
that, one last thing. We are, as always, friends

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,642

174
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,355
LAURA: Say it again. CritRole.

175
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:34,300
LIAM: You'll get free shipping. Hey, one nerd
helping out another.

176
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,381
TRAVIS: They are so sexy.

177
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:40,998
LAURA: They are very sexy. And they have magnets
in them to keep your dice protected when they're

178
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,116
in your other bags. Your Bag of Holding.

179
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,107
MARISHA: Christmas is just around the corner.

180
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:50,111
MATT: It keeps my Critmas bronze? Thank you.

181
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,204
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you've got your little mini.

182
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:57,343
MATT: I know I'm so excited I have a mini! I'm not
even in the game, really, but I am.

183
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:02,145
LAURA: That's Gilmore's mini. Any time Gilmore
talks, can he have that mini?

184
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:06,864
MATT: No. I'm going to one day do a Gilmore mini
in private. It'll be fun. All right.

185
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:09,462
LIAM: I brought this for good luck today.

186
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,354
(laughter)

187
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:14,481
LIAM: It's going to be my woobie.

188
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:22,959
TALIESIN: Hey, now. Not cool. Not cool. We do not
use the W word around here.

189
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,594
SAM: Does he even know what he's saying?

190
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:26,146
TALIESIN: Yeah, he knows.

191
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,731
LIAM: We're off the rails again.

192
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,887
SAM: All right, let's go.

193
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:29,730
TALIESIN: Sorry.

194
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,257
MARISHA: Fucking vampires.

195
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,656
MATT: Did you use woobie intentionally?

196
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:33,601
LIAM: Yes.

197
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,748
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

198
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,874
LIAM: He's in Mr. Mom!

199
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:40,053
TALIESIN: They don't know where you're pointing.

200
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,028
LAURA: Point down!

201
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:48,441
LIAM: He's in Mr. Mom. This guy right here.

202
00:10:48,441 --> 00:11:00,515
MATT: Anyway! Let's get kicking into this
evening's episode of Critical Role. So. To get all

203
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:08,955
of you up to speed. The party has traveled to
Whitestone, partially to free their name of some

204
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:14,746
negative political ramifications back in their
home city of Emon, and to aid Percy in possibly

205
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:20,278
freeing his hometown of Whitestone from the
oppression of Lord and Lady Briarwood, a couple

206
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:27,060
who have risen to power over the past five years
after slaughtering his family and taking it over

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,712
and keeping it all this time.

208
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:36,705
After arriving, they found a very heavy undead
presence in the town, with giant zombies roaming

209
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:44,649
the streets as sentinels. Most of the townsfolk
kept under perpetual watch in this slowly

210
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:51,033
will-crushing atmosphere. But as Vox Machina
arrived, they began to instill the thoughts of

211
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:57,675
rebellion. Stoking those flames once again with
the return of the surviving de Rolo, they began to

212
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,516
sway the people's minds to make a final stand.

213
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:06,198
During that time, they also discovered that
Percy's sister Cassandra is also a surviving de

214
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:12,614
Rolo and exists somewhere in Castle Whitestone,
seemingly under lock and key. The party began to

215
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:17,934
systematically take out members of the new nobles
who worked underneath the Briarwoods, setting many

216
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:23,770
buildings on fire, leaving emblems of the de Rolo
crest across the town and written in the sky, and

217
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:30,093
after an extensive battle, began to make their way
toward Castle Whitestone itself. Burrowing into a

218
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:37,347
partially collapsed but long-remembered secret
passage underneath the castle, the party rested

219
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:44,313
for the evening with the help of their recently
arrived cleric Pike, who had managed to project

220
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:49,653
herself through the will of Sarenrae as a
spiritual body given temporary physical form.

221
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:55,610
While they were searching this tunnel, it led to
the dungeons, the prison cells beneath the Castle

222
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,982
Whitestone where Percy once woke up five years
before, before Cassandra helped him escape. While

223
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:07,369
they were walking through those cells, they
discovered an old woman currently locked down

224
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:15,260
below there who is asking for the party's aid in
freeing her from her imprisonment. And last time

225
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,205
we left off, you were helping with--

226
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,352
LAURA: Fake helping.

227
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,816
MATT: Fake helping with the lock, much to her
chagrin.

228
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,039
LAURA: Yeah, and I had just snapped it off into
the locks so that it's jammed it.

229
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,140
MATT: Yeah, you're a terrible person. All right,
so as you snap off the lock and pull away from it,

230
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,104
having the strange physical interaction in the
darkness around here, Trinket behind you just

231
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:44,146
breathing over your shoulder, keeping close to you
just in case anything's wrong. She pulls her hands

232
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:50,898
away. "Fine. (huff) Do as you wish, leave me to
rot."

233
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,357
LAURA: Oh, we'll be back. Don't worry.

234
00:13:53,357 --> 00:14:00,410
MATT: She backs up and sits in the far corner of
the prison cell and (huffs).

235
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,821
LAURA: I look around. Has everyone left me?

236
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,917
TRAVIS: The only people that are in the light--

237
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:09,498
LAURA: All right then I follow to where everybody
else is going.

238
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,771
MATT: All right.

239
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,036
TRAVIS: She only saw me and--

240
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,348
LAURA: Me and Scanlan.

241
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,615
MATT: And Scanlan, yeah. You all stepped out into
the light. The rest of you stayed in the shadows.

242
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:23,484
LAURA: Okay.

243
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:31,357
MATT: All right, so there are the rest of the
cells which Vax has gone through and taken some

244
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:35,709
time to inspect, where you found what appear to be
the remnants of individuals who were imprisoned

245
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,544
here and then left to die, long rotted, their
corpses picked apart by various resident rodents

246
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:48,488
and other creatures. After doing your passes, the
conversation has happened, you see no other signs

247
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:54,442
of life down here. This being the sole prisoner
currently within the cells below.

248
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:57,318
LAURA: I go and I find Scanlan.

249
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,889
SAM: Oi.

250
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,053
LAURA: So, question.

251
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:02,246
SAM: Yes?

252
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:17,538
LAURA: When you cast Seeming on us, our visual--
if you made me look like a cow, would I seem like

253
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,587
a cow when I bumped into you, or would I seem like
a human?

254
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,536
SAM: Are you asking me to make you into a cow
right now?

255
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:24,358
LAURA: No, I'm saying that if something was
different--

256
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,042
SAM: Because I think this is not the right time.

257
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,344
LAURA: I think that old woman was doing something
weird.

258
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,494
SAM: Why do you think that?

259
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:32,769
LAURA: Because she looked like she had full
handses, but--

260
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,018
SAM: Four hands?

261
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,556
LAURA: Full.

262
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,327
SAM: Oh, full hands. Okay.

263
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,684
LAURA: Normal sort of hands, but I didn't feel
them.

264
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:44,083
SAM: You didn't feel them? You touched her hand
and it just passed right through?

265
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,460
LAURA: Her hand touched me, but it didn't--

266
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,344
SAM: That's an illusion of some sort, yeah.

267
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,637
LAURA: So she was doing some sort of--

268
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:54,064
SAM: I don't know what, but yes. If I were to cast
Seeming on us, or some other sort of magic, it

269
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:57,475
would make us look one way but not feel that way.

270
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,335
LAURA: I guess it's good that we left her, then.

271
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,754
SAM: She's a caster of some sort?

272
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,783
LAURA: I don't know.

273
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,423
TRAVIS: Can you dispel Seeming?

274
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,819
SAM: Should we go find out?

275
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,139
LAURA: I don't know.

276
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,447
TRAVIS: How would we do that?

277
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,381
LAURA: Can you dispel Seeming?

278
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,913
SAM: I don't know. (laughing) Let's go find out.

279
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:19,677
MARISHA: Do you have a Dispel Magic on you right
now?

280
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:20,897
SAM: I have-- No.

281
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,456
MARISHA: Oh my god, I do!

282
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:23,247
SAM: Well.

283
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,368
MARISHA: I learned it.

284
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,409
SAM: Oh, Keyleth?

285
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,759
TALIESIN: Are we calling everyone over for this
conversation?

286
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,179
SAM: I think we should.

287
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,548
TRAVIS: Away from her.

288
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:33,929
LAURA: Yeah, I'm far away from her now.

289
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,911
SAM: That prisoner over there is casting magic of
some sort.

290
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:41,258
LAURA: I think she had Seeming cast on her. I
don't know if she did it herself or if-- well, I

291
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,807
don't think she was what she appeared to be.

292
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,859
TALIESIN: Do we want to waste power on somebody
who's...

293
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:45,942
SAM: What if she's--

294
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:47,061
TRAVIS: An early warning system?

295
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,486
SAM: Yeah, what if she's a guard?

296
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:53,113
MARISHA: What if she's Lady Briarwood? Like what
we were saying? That's what I'm most afraid of.

297
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,722
SAM: Well, then we should find out now and kill
the shit out of her.

298
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,749
TRAVIS: I vote for that.

299
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:05,109
MARISHA: Well, before we do that, let's see who
she is. I did come prepared, though,

300
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,842
to dispel magic.

301
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,077
LAURA: So you can do Dispel Magic?

302
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,508
MARISHA: I learned it. I did.

303
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,315
LAURA: Stay in the shadows, Keyleth, and cast it
on her.

304
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:15,362
TRAVIS: Percy, you're wearing what?

305
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:20,252
TALIESIN: I'm wearing a hat of disguise so that
I'm not immediately identifiable.

306
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,089
TRAVIS: What are you in disguise as?

307
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,683
LAURA: A dude in a hat.

308
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:28,471
TALIESIN: Link from the Legend of Zelda. I don't
know.

309
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,599
SAM: Well, you've got to figure it out right now.

310
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,641
TALIESIN: I'm going to figure it out right now.
Just as a reasonable Whitestone peasant.

311
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,746
MATT: Okay.

312
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,299
LIAM: Terrible teeth.

313
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,688
TALIESIN: Trying to blend in.

314
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:45,511
MATT: By comparison to this troop, you're some
poor sap who got pulled along, but yeah. You are

315
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:52,046
that one quest-giver in Warcraft that walks way
too slow and the party is like, "Come on, move!"

316
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,912
That's who you look like right now.

317
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:59,957
TRAVIS: Before we dispel magic on her, should we
have someone put her in their sights in case she

318
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,449
gets a little funky monkey?

319
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:02,916
MARISHA: She will be able to feel it.

320
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,493
LAURA: Well, yeah. She'll look like she's not
herself.

321
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:09,120
TALIESIN: We could also just ask her to drop it.

322
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,996
TRAVIS: We asked her who she was. She lied. A
lot.

323
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:17,133
TALIESIN: Well, we could ask her to drop the
Seeming.

324
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,627
MARISHA: She lied pretty well, too.

325
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:19,952
TALIESIN: She did.

326
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:25,393
SAM: I could go talk to her, and meanwhile she
could be fiddling with her magic behind me.

327
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:26,571
LAURA: Do it.

328
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,279
MARISHA: You go talk to her. I'll be prepared.

329
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,926
LAURA: I'll stay in the shadows with my arrow
notched.

330
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,389
TRAVIS: I'll stay with Scanlan in case things go
wrong.

331
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:37,764
MARISHA: I stay next to Vex.

332
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,055
TALIESIN: I stay in the shadows.

333
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:40,936
LIAM: How close together are the bars to this
cell?

334
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,663
MATT: The bars are about four inches apart.

335
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:44,553
LIAM: Four inches.

336
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:46,470
LAURA: So my arrow will do much better than your
dagger.

337
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,844
LIAM: Well, no. I'm not saying for you not to, but
would I be able to comfortably throw through?

338
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,364
MATT: Yeah!

339
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,116
LIAM: Yeah? All right. I'm not telling you not
to.

340
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,416
LAURA: No, it's fine.

341
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,179
MATT: She'd have a little bit of cover.

342
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,185
LAURA: Shoot your arrow, too. Shoot your dagger.
Whatever.

343
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:02,484
MARISHA: Shoot your dagger?

344
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:03,695
SAM: He doesn't shoot daggers

345
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:06,426
LIAM: Passive-aggressive much?

346
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,574
SAM: All right, so I stroll over back to the
cell.

347
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:10,159
TRAVIS: With Scanlan, also.

348
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,538
SAM: Oh, flanked by Grog. Yes.

349
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:14,036
MATT: Okay.

350
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,298
TRAVIS: Not looking friendly, neither.

351
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:20,570
MATT: Okay, and there is the one torch that's a
little off to the side that gives a little bit of

352
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,180
light into this one portion of the dungeon below
here. She's sat out, into the shadows of the far

353
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,372
corner, arms crossed. You can see a little bit of
the light framing her form. You make out okay in

354
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:36,964
the darkness this close as a gnome, but you can
see that she's just hunched in the corner, huffing

355
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:38,857
in frustration.

356
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:45,883
SAM: Oi. Old lady. Listen. We said we were going
to come back for you and release you when all was

357
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:52,413
said and done, but we cannot make that promise if
you don't tell us the complete truth. Now, we know

358
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:55,989
that you're using magic of some sort. Tell us who
you really are.

359
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:58,989
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

360
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,610
SAM: We are smart little people. And big people.

361
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,723
TRAVIS: Thank you.

362
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:10,739
SAM: And we can sense that you are casting magic
of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself.

363
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:17,640
Now, I have some familiarity with this, so I make
no judgment as to why, but please reveal your

364
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:23,390
true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we
will leave you here to rot and possibly die.

365
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,077
TRAVIS: (whispered) Now.

366
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:31,601
MARISHA: Now! I do it now!

367
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,664
(laughter)

368
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,570
SAM: "Now, I do it now?"

369
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,161
TRAVIS: Hopefully quieter than that.

370
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:48,130
MATT: As Keyleth, partially in the shadows-- the
form of Scanlan small enough to not really obscure

371
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,640
her presence-- but she nevertheless gestures in
the air, recites beneath her words the forbidden

372
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,908
druidic languages that coalesce the powers of
nature around. At which point, there's a dull

373
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:12,631
flash of energy within the cell. Some of the
nearby straw on the ground gets blown away from

374
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:16,673
her form from the general push of air the spell
disperses and the impact.

375
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,269
MARISHA: Sorry, got a little squirrely on that
one.

376
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:29,443
MATT: The grey hair, the tattered clothes all
vanish, revealing beneath it a woman in her early

377
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:36,104
mid-forties or so. Jet black hair pulled into a
tight ponytail, but strings of it in front of her

378
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:41,645
face. Still in disarray but nowhere near as
wrecked as the previous visage you were presented

379
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:51,480
with. She's wearing nice travel clothes with what
looks like some sort of a long duster-like coat

380
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,722
that is a little ragged. You can see there's a
little stain from being down here for a while. As

381
00:21:57,722 --> 00:22:01,949
soon as this moment hits, she pushes back even
further, pressing herself against the wall, arms

382
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,288
to the side.

383
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,238
TRAVIS: There you are.

384
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:09,415
SAM: I must say, you look way better like this.

385
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:13,558
MATT: "Happy?"

386
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,399
SAM: Extremely.

387
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,648
TRAVIS: Yes, I'd say so.

388
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:19,267
SAM: Yes, so who are you for real?

389
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:30,379
MATT: "My name is Anna, and I would like to be set
free, if you don't mind. I can be of assistance to

390
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:34,619
"you. I happen to know a lot of information about
the people that currently

391
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,615
"reside within this castle."

392
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:38,645
SAM: How would you know anything about them?

393
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:42,511
MATT: "Release me and I'll tell you."

394
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:44,408
TRAVIS: You want to be set free?

395
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,648
LAURA: Tell us and we'll release you.

396
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:52,511
MATT: "You've been so forthright in your interest
in helping such an old and frail woman. How can I

397
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,957
"have any sort of guarantee of my safety should I
give you the information you seek? You could very

398
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,850
"well slay me in this cell."

399
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,771
TRAVIS: That might happen if you're not careful.

400
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:02,270
MARISHA: What's Percy doing right now? Where's
Percy?

401
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,872
LAURA: Do you recognize her, Percy?

402
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:07,065
TALIESIN: Yes.

403
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:16,748
MATT: You very much recognize her. You do notice,
by the way, her right hand? The sleeve ends. There

404
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:21,205
is no hand there. It is just a missing hand, and
the left hand is visible.

405
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:25,808
TRAVIS: As far as we can see, unarmed? Right?

406
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:26,962
MATT: Yeah.

407
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:28,052
TALIESIN: Anna?

408
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,160
MATT: "Yes?"

409
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:38,030
TALIESIN: Let's be frank with each other. You have
two options: either you are going to die in this

410
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:45,401
cell-- and I promise you, you will die in this cell--
or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't.

411
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:53,664
So I would start talking right now or I swear we
will not leave this dungeon before you're dead.

412
00:23:53,664 --> 00:24:01,574
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

413
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,705
MARISHA: It's pretty good.

414
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,351
TALIESIN: 16.

415
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,543
MATT: 16, okay.

416
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:14,114
LIAM: And just as he finishes talking, I throw a
dagger a foot away from her head in the wall.

417
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:15,051
MATT: Okay.

418
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,951
LAURA: You gave her a fucking dagger? And then it
flashes back to you, right?

419
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:19,989
(laughter)

420
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:26,422
MATT: So the dagger which is thrown (whoosh) hits
the stone wall next to her and jams itself between

421
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:32,297
two of the stone bricks and gets wedged there for
a second. She looks over for a second, reaches up

422
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:35,652
for it and grabs the hilt as it vanishes in a puff
of smoke.

423
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,365
LAURA: You are so fucking lucky it did that.

424
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:43,335
(laughter)

425
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:48,272
MATT: She leans forward and stands up and steps
into the light, and you have a better look of her

426
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:53,699
now, and her face is a little weathered from
travel. You can see she definitely doesn't appear

427
00:24:53,699 --> 00:25:05,835
to be nobleborn, at least. She's by no means a
homely looking individual, but you can see she's

428
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:10,764
seen the world, or elements of it, to have those
dark lines at the sides of her face, whether it be

429
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:17,684
from smiles or frowning. She steps into the light
and looks to you, this peasant individual making

430
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:24,395
these threats, and seems partially shaken but
keeping her composure in the face of such threats.

431
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:33,014
She says, "Well, for one thing, I've been here
with them for the past five years. I helped them

432
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:39,233
"reestablish their current social control of this
city when they left it a pile of flames and

433
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:44,703
"rubble. And their little experiment beneath the
castle?

434
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:48,604
"I was one of their chief scientific designers."

435
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:52,815
TALIESIN: Tell us about the experiments beneath
the castle.

436
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:56,702
MATT: (chuckles) "You'll have to ask Sylas or
Delilah for that. I don't have all the details or

437
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:59,976
"the reasons behind it, other than the process I
was brought in to construct."

438
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,799
MARISHA: Can I see if she's lying?

439
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,075
MATT: You can. Make an insight check.

440
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:06,895
MARISHA: Not great.

441
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:08,544
TALIESIN: That's a number.

442
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,558
MARISHA: It is a number. 16.

443
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:20,381
MATT: 16? Okay. You get the sense that she's
telling the truth. You're not quite sure how far

444
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:26,802
off the truth, but there doesn't seem to be any
sort of bald-faced deception in her voice, at this

445
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:31,359
point. She speaks with a confidence and a
brusqueness of a person who is frustrated by the

446
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:39,149
circumstance and has no other choice. "I wasn't
interested in their zealotry or the whispered

447
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:44,195
"dealings, just the challenge behind the
construction. I enjoy challenge. Challenge that

448
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:47,863
"pays, well, (chuckles) I enjoy that even more."

449
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:54,997
TALIESIN: Question two: What are you doing down
here, really?

450
00:26:54,997 --> 00:27:02,106
MATT: "I'm down here because my work is done and I
wish not to linger with an impending battle. I

451
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:07,348
"don't choose sides; I merely let them fight while
I live another day far, far away. I wouldn't have

452
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:12,430
"gotten this far dealing with the people I've dealt
with in the past if I had chosen to stick around

453
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:19,542
"under such circumstances, so I tried to leave. It
appears Anders saw me packing and decided to gain

454
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:25,120
'a little favor by turning me in, so they threw me
down here, told me to wait out the rest of the

455
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,281
"experiment, at least until the ziggurat was
complete. So here I am, living amongst rats in a

456
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,016
"cell for over a week. That's my reward."

457
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:37,391
LAURA: How did you lose the hand?

458
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:44,017
MATT: "Experiments can be dangerous, sometimes. I
dabble with chemicals and alchemical reagents that

459
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:53,281
"can be miscalculated, and I paid a price that will
be an ever-present reminder until I can find a way

460
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:56,185
"to fix it. And there are ways."

461
00:27:56,185 --> 00:28:00,067
TRAVIS: Are you looking for ways to get back at
the Briarwoods?

462
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:07,166
MATT: "Based on the way they've treated me here
and their possible intent to not even keep up

463
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:11,312
"their end of the bargain now that I'm free to walk
away? Perhaps."

464
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:15,161
TALIESIN: Can you lead us to Cassandra de Rolo?

465
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:25,692
MATT: She turns her head with a curious look. "I
could, yes. Why do you ask?" She looks at you very

466
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:26,698
intently.

467
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:30,856
TALIESIN: That may be what your life is worth.

468
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:44,175
MATT: "So. What else do you wish to know? What
else do you need, even, to get me out from behind

469
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:48,611
"these bars? Because I'm growing very uncomfortable
and cold here in this cellar."

470
00:28:48,611 --> 00:29:00,297
TALIESIN: I pull forward, I look her very deeply
in the eye, and I say, you should know who your

471
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:08,169
friends are here. Do you know that we're friends?
And I'm going to become friends.

472
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,531
I'm casting Friends.

473
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,838
MATT: Okay.

474
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:17,571
TRAVIS and LAURA: What?

475
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:23,113
TRAVIS: Is good Percy casting Friends or shadow
monster casting Friends?

476
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:28,642
SAM: We'll never know until he and Ripley kill us
all.

477
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,918
TALIESIN: I'm getting creepy. Just for flavor.
There is definitely some creepy happening.

478
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:37,477
MATT: Okay. You stare at her at this point, intent
pushing yourself toward the bars, and she's still

479
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:42,093
looking you over like she's searching for some
sort of an inclination as to why you're so

480
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,075
interested in these particular questions.

481
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:51,870
TALIESIN: You've been truthful with us so far,
correct? You haven't been fudging around or

482
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,214
playing games with us, really, have you?

483
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:57,285
MATT: "I've no reason to lie. Worst comes to
worst, you kill me where I stand or leave me here

484
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:01,428
"to rot. What do I have to gain by lying at this
point? Besides, you've already proven you can see

485
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,015
"through quite a few ruses. Apparently."

486
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:10,266
TALIESIN: So you'd be happy to help us find
Cassandra de Rolo, wouldn't you?

487
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:14,792
MATT: "If it gets me out of here and gets me free
to do my own business, then yes. I'll have to get

488
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:22,071
"a few things from my room, but I would be more
than happy to be free of this desolate landscape.

489
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:31,247
"This whole town is a ruin of misery, and it has no
color. It has no culture. I've grown bored of it."

490
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,778
LAURA: You say you're a scientist.

491
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:33,657
MATT: "Yes."

492
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,661
LAURA: Do you use magic?

493
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:47,265
MATT: "I've no interest in paltry magics. I'm more
of one who embraces the sciences as a means of

494
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:52,277
"understanding mystery. My whole purpose here was
one giant chemical experiment."

495
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:56,234
LAURA: Then who cast Seeming on you?

496
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:59,995
MATT: "Oh, that isn't to say I have don't have my
tricks."

497
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:10,969
TALIESIN: Anna. You will take us to Cassandra de
Rolo. You will tell us what you know about what's

498
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:16,165
in the basement. You will tell us where to find
Lord and Lady Briarwood, and you will tell us

499
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:24,627
where to find professor Anders. And for this, we
may let you go.

500
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:29,347
MATT: "Hmm, may. That word, 'may.'"

501
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,632
TALIESIN: I'll let you leave the castle.

502
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:39,081
MATT: "And if I agree to these terms, you'll
release me at this moment? Keep me safe until it

503
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:41,340
"is time for me to take my leave?"

504
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,554
SAM: We may chain you to a bear, but yes.

505
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:48,872
LAURA: This is Clarota all fucking over again.

506
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:57,736
TALIESIN: You are, at the moment, the luckiest
person in Whitestone. Do you know why? Because

507
00:31:57,736 --> 00:31:59,872
you're at the bottom of my list.

508
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:02,145
(laughter)

509
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:03,706
TALIESIN: And I take off the hat.

510
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:08,614
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh shit!

511
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:18,130
MATT: As the peasant image fades, for her, there's
an intensity to her eyes, a widening of

512
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:26,374
realization as she steps back instinctually with a
gasp. And there is definite fear in her voice and

513
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:32,056
her eyes, but there's an uncontrollable smile on
her face which catches you off guard.

514
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:37,159
"Percival." (laughs)

515
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,049
MARISHA: She's a nervous laugher.

516
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:49,838
MATT: "Well, then. This certainly explains a lot.
I have many questions. I found your recent work

517
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,629
"very fascinating."

518
00:32:51,629 --> 00:33:00,378
TALIESIN: I will be happy to give you an up close
and very personal demonstration. Unless, of

519
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,818
course, you would rather have conversations about
other topics.

520
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:12,411
MATT: "We'll start with the other topics." She
adjusts her coat, regains her composure, and steps

521
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:15,357
up to the bars expectantly.

522
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:16,601
SAM: Vax?

523
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:21,353
LIAM: All right. I come out of the shadows.

524
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,761
LAURA: Oh god, are we really letting her out?

525
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:27,038
SAM: Get a chain ready, or a noose of some sort.

526
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,312
TRAVIS: No, we have manacles.

527
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:32,312
LAURA: She's got one hand. How's that going to be
useful?

528
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:36,335
MARISHA: One hand and then one on the bear,
right?

529
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:40,647
TALIESIN: It means there's only one to shoot off
to make sure she won't be a problem.

530
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:50,724
LIAM: I pull out a pick and I walk up to the gate
and I say, he's a very good shot. She's a <i>very</i>

531
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:52,129
good shot.

532
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:57,380
LAURA: He poops on things.

533
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:03,684
LIAM: This guy, I've watched turn things into the
Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very

534
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:05,486
carefully.

535
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:12,110
MARISHA: And then I peek out of the shadows and
go, hi. (giggles)

536
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,814
LIAM: She's a nervous laugher.

537
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:15,594
(laughter)

538
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:20,815
MATT: Go ahead and make a check lock pick. This
will be more difficult than normal because--

539
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:24,715
LAURA: I snapped off a thing in there. Sorry about
that.

540
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:32,227
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use Luck.

541
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:34,418
LAURA: You're going to use Luck now?!

542
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:35,795
SAM: Shall I inspire you?

543
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:40,324
TALIESIN: Don't use Luck yet

544
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:44,375
LIAM: It's not that bad. That's a 20.

545
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,971
MATT: That's a 20 baseline?

546
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:48,648
LIAM: Yeah, because of my--

547
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:53,177
MATT: Expertise? All right. 20 is exactly what you
needed.

548
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,166
LIAM: Skadoosh.

549
00:34:55,166 --> 00:35:02,235
MATT: That was the next one. So you take a moment
you walk up all slick and (click).

550
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,587
LIAM: Wait. One sec. This never happens.

551
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:05,697
(laughter)

552
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:09,514
MATT: You have to get down and you spend the next
30 seconds actually managing to get the pin that

553
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:12,351
she has stuck in there out without actually
breaking the spring inside.

554
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,324
LAURA: Sorry about that.

555
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:15,494
SAM: Fucking doors!

556
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,738
LIAM: Shut up!

557
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:20,217
LAURA: It never ends!

558
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:24,986
MATT: About a minute and a half of awkward quiet
as the sound of scraping metal and jimmying

559
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:26,908
thieves' tools, eventually (click).

560
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,442
LIAM: We're still very tough.

561
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,602
(laughter)

562
00:35:30,602 --> 00:35:35,718
MATT: And with that, (ting) the lock comes loose
and the bars (creak) open a little bit.

563
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,868
LAURA: Trinket, watch her.

564
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:43,642
MATT: (grunts) The bear, which at this point has
been barely visible, steps

565
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,738
out of the shadows, as well--

566
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:45,795
SAM: Bear-ly?

567
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,011
(groaning)

568
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,044
MATT: It would be you.

569
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:49,500
LIAM: Kill him!

570
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:59,487
MATT: Steps out and presents a very puffed-up
Trinket made to look intimidating. (growl) Towards

571
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:01,557
Dr. Anna Ripley.

572
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:11,644
TALIESIN: Here's the deal, Anna. You do what we
ask, you do not betray us, you do not make our

573
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:24,481
life difficult in any way, and you have my word
that you will leave Whitestone unmolested by us.

574
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:33,267
If I sense the slightest hint, if I have a moment
where I think that you might make a run for it, if

575
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:41,058
I have a moment where I think you may cough
inappropriately, I would ask you to think about

576
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:47,559
everything you did to me, and I would like you to
know that I have learned so much more than what

577
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:56,879
you taught me that day, and I cannot wait to show
you. And I will. But not until I find you again.

578
00:36:56,879 --> 00:37:08,559
MATT: "Understood, Percival. Well, then. Shall
we?" She steps out of the cell, pushes the bar

579
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:15,657
aside, saunters up past you, steps over, still
facing you underneath the torch light.

580
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:18,452
SAM: Should we shackle her?

581
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,612
TALIESIN: No.

582
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,287
SAM: Oh? All right.

583
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:22,870
TALIESIN: It'll arouse suspicion.

584
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,643
MATT: "I'd like to gather my things."

585
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,492
SAM: Things? They let you have things in a prison
cell?

586
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,479
MATT: "Well, I don't have them here in the cell.
They're in my room."

587
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,318
SAM: We have to go to your room?

588
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,266
MATT: "I would like to."

589
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:36,734
LAURA: Tell us what you need and we'll get it for
you, dear.

590
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:44,457
MATT: "Very well. Come." And she begins to step up
the stairway that leads out of the dungeon.

591
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:47,346
LAURA: Can you walk quietly? Please?

592
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:52,291
MATT: You can hear the slight chuckle in the
darkness. She goes, "I haven't lived this long

593
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,422
"without learning to step a little gingerly."

594
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:59,088
SAM: Oh boy.

595
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,021
LIAM: Let's go parading through the castle.

596
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:03,573
TALIESIN: I'll follow her.

597
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,559
MATT: Okay.

598
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,949
SAM: Let's all follow her, right?

599
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:11,226
TRAVIS: We should check any of the other cells?

600
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,960
LAURA: We did. We already checked them all

601
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,089
MATT: As you're walking up the stairs, she's
talking to you a bit out loud and she's just

602
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:28,175
saying, "This whole entire endeavor-- while it did
pay well at the get-go and did pique some of my

603
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:36,506
"curiosity, I'm very happy to see it out of my life
after this." You guys get to the top of the stairs

604
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:44,891
and there is a closed wooden door there. She comes
to the door and listens to it for a second.

605
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:55,949
(creak) Opens it up and looks out. "Huh. Empty."
Holds the door open and says,

606
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:58,323
"Who would like to enter?"

607
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:00,872
SAM: You would like to enter.

608
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:08,026
MATT: "All right, just giving the offer." And
she steps into the room. This is the end of a long

609
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:12,188
hallway that leads to a series of doors on the
right and left side, and it opens into a large

610
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:24,693
central entrance chamber to what would be the
castle. So she steps in. She's not going too far

611
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:29,867
ahead. She's being very conscious that based on
the fact that she has nothing on her and you are

612
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,207
very well armed, it would not behoove her to
attempt to make a run for it.

613
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,279
LAURA: Do we see anything in the room?

614
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:42,485
TALIESIN: Perception is passive as hell right now.
I am keeping very sharp eye on--

615
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:49,716
MATT: No, I understand. Looking around. She's
taking her steps slowly, and she's looking around

616
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:54,712
corners as you guys progress. The doors that are
there-- everyone's being very quiet, just the very

617
00:39:54,712 --> 00:40:04,076
gentle sounds of careful footsteps against the
smooth stone floor. (footsteps) She turns around,

618
00:40:04,076 --> 00:40:09,315
looking at the rest of you a little confused, and
goes, "Huh. Usually there are a lot more

619
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,374
"individuals frequenting this castle."

620
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:17,739
SAM: Maybe they've been drawn out by the thing
that we incited outside that's been going on for

621
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:19,315
like 45 minutes now?

622
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,679
MARISHA: Feels like a trap.

623
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,244
LAURA: No, but there is fighting. Can we hear
fighting?

624
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:29,931
MATT: You're inside the castle right now. You
could go and if you want to try and enter one of

625
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:32,802
the rooms to the right or left, you can see if
there's a window.

626
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:36,050
SAM: Are there any open doors?

627
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,643
MATT: All the doors are currently closed.

628
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:41,674
LIAM: I just want to see if I sense anything
around.

629
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:42,741
MATT: Okay.

630
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:43,910
LIAM: 23.

631
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,792
MATT: Perception?

632
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,774
LIAM: Perception, yeah.

633
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:54,451
MATT: Okay. You take a moment and listen around.
Silent. Still. It's unnerving.

634
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:58,309
SAM: Does she have a window in her room?

635
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:59,664
MATT: You asking?

636
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:02,299
SAM: We're at her doorway, aren't we?

637
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:07,348
MATT: No, you've just stepped up to the base floor
of the castle. You're on the base floor, on the

638
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:09,694
side of it. You're not even quite sure which way
is north.

639
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:13,381
TRAVIS: Nobody we're looking for is going to be
above us, right? They're going to be below the

640
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:14,475
castle.

641
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:15,481
SAM: For sure.

642
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:18,679
TRAVIS: So we don't want her to get her shit in
her room. We need to be asking how to get below

643
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,915
the castle.

644
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:21,155
TALIESIN: We'll get there.

645
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,376
SAM: What are you getting?

646
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,550
MARISHA: She wants her weapons.

647
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,615
TALIESIN: And I want to see what she's built,
anyway.

648
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:26,944
SAM: Why would we let her have a weapon?

649
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:28,222
TRAVIS: We're not going to.

650
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:31,727
LAURA: Can't we look at what she's built after we
fight them?

651
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:33,999
SAM: It could be useful.

652
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:39,814
TALIESIN: As we're walking, I just want to very
gently take my gun--

653
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,775
SAM: And shoot her with it.

654
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:43,749
(laughter)

655
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:48,754
TALIESIN: And just put it gently at her back,
going, nothing personal.

656
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:51,148
I'm just feeling a bit nervous.

657
00:41:51,148 --> 00:42:00,245
MATT: "Understood." She straightens up a little
more and continues walking ever so carefully. Not

658
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:04,115
quite leaning her head or making too many large
movements, but definitely still keeping a

659
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:08,746
seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere
is.

660
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:11,500
LAURA: I creep over to one of the doors in the
room and see if I can hear

661
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,351
anything on the other side.

662
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:19,155
MATT: You don't hear anything inside the room.
Roll a perception check.

663
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:27,105
LAURA: (groans) 14.

664
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:39,416
MATT: You hear some slight, muffled, dull thud
noise, but you can't really tell how close it is.

665
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:41,320
It's very, very faint.

666
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,473
LAURA: Can I see if the door handle is--

667
00:42:44,473 --> 00:42:47,144
MATT: (click) It's open.

668
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:49,043
LAURA: I step to the side and push it open.

669
00:42:49,043 --> 00:42:53,412
MATT: Push it open (creak) The door opens.
Everyone before you whips around, hearing the

670
00:42:53,465 --> 00:43:07,259
noise in the silence. Looking inside, it appears
to be a long-untouched music room, a space for

671
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:12,850
hosting individuals where you would have small
performances, and there is a very cold fireplace

672
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:21,680
in the far corner. There is a small, circular
window that is placed in the center of the room

673
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,945
that has a very thick glass pane with cross bar on
it that seems to look out. And this is your first

674
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:31,164
view-- for you, especially, since you woke up in
the tunnel-- your first view of the outside.

675
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:32,602
LAURA: And?

676
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:34,482
MATT: Do you go up to the window and look?

677
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:35,912
LAURA: Sure.

678
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:38,401
LIAM: I'm following my sister in, doing the buddy
cop thing.

679
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:46,905
MATT: Okay. You two coast up to the glass and look
out, and another cloud-covered, slightly drizzly

680
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:55,917
morning has taken the caldera between the
mountains that houses Whitestone in this forest.

681
00:43:55,917 --> 00:44:04,141
You can see the entire city of Whitestone down
below this elevated part of topography. What you

682
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:10,909
do see, one, are large plumes of smoke, about six
or seven of them, all gathered towards what you

683
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:14,012
can tell now is the north side of the city, which
is the closest to you. You guys are on the

684
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:18,511
southwest side of the castle, based on the spatial
awareness you've now made.

685
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:22,505
MARISHA: Where the more upper-class folk would
live, I'm assuming?

686
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:29,543
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception check, while
you're glancing out.

687
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:30,871
MARISHA: Sure.

688
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:34,676
LIAM: So close.

689
00:44:34,676 --> 00:44:36,312
LAURA: That could've been so bad. 20.

690
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:37,152
MATT: Okay.

691
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,888
LAURA: It was like whee-- oh.

692
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:44,555
MATT: (laughing) Love those little (gasps)
moments. Taking a moment, you pull your brother in

693
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:51,200
to point out where you're looking. It looks like
the gates to the castle are wide open. There are

694
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,521
tracks through the mud that lead down the pathway
to the bottom, and right where the path from the

695
00:44:57,521 --> 00:45:03,973
castle intersects with the outer wall of
Whitestone, there is a fray going on right now. It

696
00:45:03,973 --> 00:45:08,202
looks like the remnants of whatever sort of undead
army that wasn't destroyed by you guys, combined

697
00:45:08,202 --> 00:45:14,068
with what may have been a number of the
individuals who normally guard the castle, have

698
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:20,930
all been momentarily distracted by the rebellion
you guys have started, and for the time being, at

699
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,043
least, have left elements of this castle
unguarded.

700
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:33,043
LAURA: Nice. I would loot, but it's Percival's
home. Do we see anything that looks like it could

701
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:35,243
be a doorway leading down, or anything?

702
00:45:35,243 --> 00:45:36,514
SAM: We've gone up, right?

703
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,453
LAURA: We're on the main level.

704
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:39,995
TALIESIN: We're going to try to get my sister
first.

705
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,218
LAURA: Do you know, Percival, how to go under?

706
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:46,263
TALIESIN: Yes. Unless there's something new, then
yes. I was born here.

707
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:54,273
LIAM: Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the
arm and say, "Listen to me--"

708
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,250
(creaking)

709
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:06,145
LIAM: What is that? Pizza. Forget I said that.
Listen to me, I do not have a good feeling about

710
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:15,521
this. And I start to undo the cloak that's on me,
And I want you to wear this. And I tie an elven

711
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:22,077
cloak. Shut up, please. I don't need it. You will
wear this. You will stay hidden when it is needed.

712
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:30,087
You almost lost me. I almost lost you. You will
wear this as needed.

713
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:35,345
LAURA: I will wear it. Thank you.

714
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:38,093
LIAM: I walk out ahead of her.

715
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:47,581
MATT: Pull the hood up. So you get advantage on
stealth checks. As you guys step into the hallway

716
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:57,186
and move forward, Pike's physical form is drifting
along you guys as she takes each step. You can see

717
00:46:57,229 --> 00:47:03,437
she's stopped a little bit and she's lost in
thought for a moment. And she looks at the rest of

718
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:12,513
you and says, "There is a great evil here. It's--"
And you can see part of her form flicker and shake

719
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:19,305
and almost blink for a moment, and then she
reaches forward and says, "Something's willing me

720
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:22,541
"away. I ca--" And with that, her form just
vanishes.

721
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,844
LAURA: Oh no!

722
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:27,607
TALIESIN: Damn.

723
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:34,724
MATT: As you feel this warmth on your hand, Vax,
and the symbol of Sarenrae that you have embedded

724
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:40,769
in your glove. You look down, and it has a slight
glow to it, similar to the color that her divine

725
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:47,990
energy form had taken. And you see it just slowly
fade, but not entirely. The symbol seems to just

726
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:54,489
have this general very faint radiation. A
reminder, or at least what small semblance of a

727
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:56,887
connection to her in this dark, dark place.

728
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:59,698
LIAM: (whispering) Goodbye, Pike.

729
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:05,008
TRAVIS: Before we move on from that foyer, can we
see the front door from where we're at?

730
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:10,643
MATT: If you go another 20, 30 feet ahead to the
end of this hallway, it should open up into the

731
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:13,316
main entrance chamber and you would be able to see
the doors.

732
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:14,486
TRAVIS: So we're not there yet, okay.

733
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:19,587
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment and I have an
epiphany, and I'm going to shift my form into a

734
00:48:19,587 --> 00:48:21,048
castle guard.

735
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:22,667
MATT: Okay.

736
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:31,127
SAM: Vex, what you saw through the window, should
we move through the castle quickly because it's

737
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:32,459
unguarded?

738
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:36,821
LAURA: I guess. There's fighting going on now. I
don't want to eat right now.

739
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:39,443
TALIESIN: We'll get it on the break.

740
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:49,901
LAURA: I saw fighting, lots of fighting. I feel
like if we're going to move, we need to do it

741
00:48:49,936 --> 00:48:50,873
quickly.

742
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:52,366
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're on a clock.

743
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:53,715
SAM: Okay, let's go.

744
00:48:53,715 --> 00:49:01,278
TALIESIN: Anna. I lower the gun and let her move
forward.

745
00:49:01,278 --> 00:49:03,166
TRAVIS: You don't need to lower it.

746
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:17,243
MATT: She continues forward, heads towards the
rest of the hallway into the main entrance chamber

747
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:23,147
of the castle, very carefully looking about. She
gestures to the rest of you to follow. And as you

748
00:49:23,147 --> 00:49:28,170
follow along beside her, you can see the two large
front doors that situate the entrance, the main

749
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,665
entrance to Whitestone--

750
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:30,951
SAM: Are they open?

751
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:32,283
MATT: No, they are closed.

752
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:38,229
TRAVIS: I have 20 caltrops. Can I throw ten of
them in front of the door?

753
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:39,954
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

754
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:43,197
(laughter)

755
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:46,291
MATT: They scatter and clink against the ground,
scraping against the stone and eventually coming

756
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:52,121
to a stop loosely around the two doors, which are
about eight feet wide each, so 16 feet of it, so

757
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:55,059
you're scattering about one every foot and a
half.

758
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:59,557
LIAM: I watched him do that, and I shrug and I
reach into my pack, and I throw 30 more of them.

759
00:49:59,557 --> 00:50:04,498
MATT: Okay. The area has a little more coverage on
there, but nevertheless there is a nice cluster of

760
00:50:04,498 --> 00:50:07,446
nasty spiked caltrops now.

761
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:10,450
LAURA: That was a good idea. Very smart there.

762
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,621
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thank you.

763
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:12,861
SAM: Grog, using your noggin.

764
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:14,034
TRAVIS: One a day.

765
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:15,195
(laughter)

766
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:20,479
TALIESIN: Was that a thought for the day, then?
Don't sprain yourself. We need you later.

767
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,057
TRAVIS: I'm back.

768
00:50:22,057 --> 00:50:24,108
(laughter)

769
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:32,224
MATT: Ripley starts making her way up the stairs,
and the staircase ascends for a good 15 feet up

770
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:35,176
before it splits into two curved stairways that
come around to a second landing

771
00:50:35,176 --> 00:50:36,505
to the second floor.

772
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:39,797
MARISHA: So hang on one second, real quick, he's
dressed as a guard?

773
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:40,898
TALIESIN: Yes.

774
00:50:40,898 --> 00:50:48,444
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance
Ability on you. For charisma.

775
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:49,997
TALIESIN: I don't need it.

776
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:51,843
MATT: Well, you do now.

777
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:53,290
TALIESIN: Has it worn off?

778
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,020
MATT: It lasts for a minute, so yeah, it's worn
off.

779
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,464
MARISHA: Oh, it only lasts for a minute?

780
00:50:56,464 --> 00:50:58,872
MATT: Friends only lasts for a minute.

781
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:02,181
TALIESIN: I had enhance charisma on for a while,
but now it's gone, so if you do it,

782
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:06,941
what I had is gone--

783
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:08,854
TRAVIS: Pour some sugar on, Keyleth.

784
00:51:08,854 --> 00:51:12,705
MARISHA: I'll do it. I'm going to enhance. In case
we get busted. So you'll have advantage on

785
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:13,874
persuasion rolls.

786
00:51:13,874 --> 00:51:16,094
MATT: Okay, so you have advantage on all
charisma-based ability checks.

787
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:18,286
TALIESIN: All right, putting that down.

788
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:20,514
MARISHA: Also, no one forget that we have Heroes'
Feast.

789
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:27,950
LAURA: Wait, if I put the holy oil on things, it
lasts for a few hours, right? It lasts for half a

790
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,106
day or something?

791
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:31,187
MATT: I'd say it lasts for about an hour after
application.

792
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:33,110
TALIESIN: Wait until we're in the thick of it.

793
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,537
MATT: The oil will eventually just drift off, as
it is an oil.

794
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:37,906
LAURA: It dries and stuff.

795
00:51:37,906 --> 00:51:41,209
MATT: Yeah, it dries and gets rubbed off. It lasts
about an hour after application.

796
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,877
TALIESIN: Let's head to her room.

797
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:51,966
MATT: Okay. You head up the stairs. She's being
very quiet about it. She comes up to the landing,

798
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:57,938
heads to the first major hallway that opens up
into a long set that goes all the way to the

799
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:06,623
eastern side of the castle. You recognize this
area. This is where a number of smaller guest

800
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:16,737
rooms were arranged. There's also a reading room.
Around the corner and down the way is where your

801
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:26,277
father's study is. And around the back is where
Professor Anders's study was. She continues

802
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:31,099
forward and eventually stops at a door halfway
down the hall. Motions to all of you.

803
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:33,890
"Do you mind?"

804
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,751
LAURA: What do you want? What's in there?

805
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,682
MATT: "My belongings."

806
00:52:38,682 --> 00:52:41,088
TALIESIN: I want to see what you've been working
on.

807
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:45,881
MATT: "All right." She opens the door. (creak)

808
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:48,150
MARISHA: I'll wait outside and stand watch.

809
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,553
LAURA: I walk in with her.

810
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:51,151
TRAVIS: I stay right next to her.

811
00:52:51,151 --> 00:53:02,699
MATT: So in her room, it's very plainly decorated.
You know these rooms are generally very well

812
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:08,049
decorated, just in case. Decorations have been
taken off. This room looks very minimalistic and

813
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:15,527
for the most part more for function than anything
else. You see there is plain sheets on the bed,

814
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:23,559
most of the room's open space is taken by a long
table that's been put here that has a series of

815
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:31,685
alchemical glassware, and you can see what looks
to be small containers that contain different

816
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:40,142
materials and powders and seems like she does her
own work here. There are two open drums on the

817
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:52,340
side, and there is this very caustic smell to the
air. There is an acerbic tinge to the nose as soon

818
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:58,177
as the room enters. There's just this
ever-present, very heavy fresh rust smell to the

819
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:06,580
room. She walks to the far end. Underneath the
desk that contains this alchemical setup, she

820
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,699
pulls a small chest out--

821
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,705
TALIESIN: I watch very carefully.

822
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:14,875
MATT: She brings the chest to the top. She opens
it up, and on the inside you can see just some

823
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:19,144
folded clothing. She moves the clothing off to the
side and she pulls out what looks like relatively

824
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:22,304
simple leather armor. "May I?"

825
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,616
TRAVIS: Very, very slowly.

826
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:29,546
LAURA: Don't be creepy, Grog.

827
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:30,687
(laughter)

828
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:34,335
TRAVIS: Creepy? I'm going to put her through the
wall if she moves in the wrong way.

829
00:54:34,335 --> 00:54:36,899
TALIESIN: You know, I almost killed you in
Stillben.

830
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,827
MATT: "Really?"

831
00:54:38,827 --> 00:54:41,305
TALIESIN: Do you remember?

832
00:54:41,305 --> 00:54:44,263
MATT: "Huh. I didn't know that was you."

833
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:47,298
TALIESIN: I was kind of curious if you had figured
it out or not.

834
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:48,466
MATT: "No."

835
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:51,936
LAURA: Tell you what, I'll hold onto that armor
for the time being.

836
00:54:51,936 --> 00:54:53,339
MATT: She's partway into it.

837
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:56,298
LAURA: Yeah, you can take it off. We'll put it in
the Bag of Holding. You can put it

838
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:57,949
on after we're done.

839
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:04,516
MATT: (heavy sigh) She folds the tunic portion
over the chest piece and hands it to you, pulls

840
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:07,570
out some of the arm braces and leg guards and
hands those over as well.

841
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,739
TALIESIN: Show me your work.

842
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:17,608
MATT: She goes underneath the chest and she pulls
out two small glass vials and sets them on the

843
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:23,521
side. She then reaches underneath and pulls up
what looks to be a false bottom of the chest.

844
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:31,752
Places it. At which point she reaches in and pulls
out a metallic construction that you all see looks

845
00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:37,347
not unlike in shape and purpose as the Pepperbox
that you've seen Percy use all this time, though

846
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:46,195
it has only a single barrel and has a small
rotating four-part chamber to it. It's a little

847
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:54,803
more refined than his construction, and you can
see now part of the alchemical setup she has in

848
00:55:54,803 --> 00:56:00,219
here actually is, and you recognize this as you
get close, part of it is designed in the creation

849
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:08,262
of ammunition and refining the powder that is used
by this process. You see a series of notes that

850
00:56:08,262 --> 00:56:13,876
are off to the side that have sketches outlined of
your Pepperbox, though not really accurate. Almost

851
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:20,173
like they were recalled from various individuals
that had seen it in person and given accounts of

852
00:56:20,173 --> 00:56:24,423
it. She's been keeping a very close log of
eyewitness accounts of your weaponry, apparently,

853
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,866
for some time.

854
00:56:25,866 --> 00:56:28,065
SAM: She's a fangirl.

855
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:29,094
MARISHA: Yeah, she is.

856
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:33,708
TALIESIN: I'm disappointed. I was expecting
something more imaginative.

857
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:38,289
MATT: (laughs) "You've seen my room, have you not?
I prefer function."

858
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:42,520
TALIESIN: (scoffs) Hack.

859
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,932
MATT: She reaches down and--

860
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:45,991
TRAVIS: Keep your hands away and step back.

861
00:56:45,991 --> 00:56:49,238
TALIESIN: We'll give those to you when it's time
to leave.

862
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:55,582
MATT: "How am I to defend myself should things go,
and pardon my term, ass-up?"

863
00:56:55,582 --> 00:57:00,620
LAURA: Are you planning on fighting with us?
Helping us?

864
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,270
MATT: "You say you won't release me until you've
finished what you're doing here. I assume that what

865
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:11,911
"you're doing here is ending the current reign of
those who rule this town. I can't assume that's

866
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:14,238
"going to end with a conversation."

867
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:16,744
LIAM: I lean my head in and say, the goliath
could turn your head into paste now,

868
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:18,146
if you like.

869
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:23,578
LAURA: Tell you what, we'll take the weapons and
give it to you if we need your help.

870
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:28,664
TALIESIN: Let her have the armor. As a sign of
good faith.

871
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:30,502
TRAVIS: What if it's enchanted armor?

872
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:38,023
TALIESIN: And give me your ammunition. And when
it's time, I will hand some to you.

873
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:40,990
SAM: So you're leaving her the weapons but no
ammo?

874
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,219
LAURA: No, I'm taking the weapon.

875
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,526
TALIESIN: The weapon's useless.

876
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,151
LAURA: I don't care.

877
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:49,445
MATT: She gives you the weapon begrudgingly. Hands
you a pouch about this big that's pretty heavy,

878
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:58,609
containing a series of iron balls inside. You can
see there's the various instruments she uses for

879
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:03,335
forging them and crafting them there across the
table. She puts her hand out towards you for the

880
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:09,080
armor. She puts it on, a little quicker this time,
because she feels like she had a little victory.

881
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,574
She takes a little vial, puts it in her pocket.
She reaches over and grabs a little pouch inside

882
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:20,055
the side with change. Puts a little bit of money
to the side there.

883
00:58:20,055 --> 00:58:23,319
TRAVIS: What are in those vials?

884
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:29,006
MATT: She reaches in, pulls them out, shows them
to you. And you recognize the color. She goes,

885
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:35,414
"What, you think you're the only one who doesn't
occasionally suffer a wound? I have to look after

886
00:58:35,414 --> 00:58:39,310
"myself, as well." It's a greater healing potion.

887
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,610
TRAVIS: One of them is? Or they both are?

888
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,295
MATT: The one she pulled out and showed you.

889
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:45,115
TRAVIS: What about the other one?

890
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:48,301
(laughter)

891
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:49,603
MATT: "Really?"

892
00:58:49,603 --> 00:58:53,873
TRAVIS: Really. Lest your brains leak out your
ears.

893
00:58:53,873 --> 00:59:01,287
MATT: She pulls out the other one. "This is in
case things go really poorly and I need to uphold

894
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,831
"my sense of self-preservation."

895
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,987
LAURA: What does that mean?

896
00:59:05,987 --> 00:59:07,801
TRAVIS: Yeah, what does that mean?

897
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:12,109
MATT: (sighs angrily)

898
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:14,185
TALIESIN: Convince us to let you keep it.

899
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:19,170
MATT: "It allows me to make a fleeting escape on
the air as opposed to by foot."

900
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:24,620
LAURA: Oh. Well, then give it to me.

901
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,017
TRAVIS: Axe.

902
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:28,134
(laughter)

903
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:32,176
MATT: And with that, the glass almost shatters
with the amount of frustrating force she slams

904
00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:33,609
it into your hand.

905
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:36,352
LAURA: Careful. That's made of glass, darling.

906
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:39,822
TRAVIS: I was only stretching. No need to get
testy.

907
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,136
MATT: So you have a Potion of Flying in your
inventory right now.

908
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:47,426
TALIESIN: And god forbid you'll see how gracious
we're feeling when we find Cassandra De Rolo

909
00:59:47,426 --> 00:59:48,407
unhurt.

910
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:51,832
SAM: Yeah, Grog! Grog with the steal.

911
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:54,347
LAURA: Ooh, I get a piece of paper!

912
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:55,627
TRAVIS: Shit, Potion of Flying.

913
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:57,096
LAURA: This is awesome.

914
00:59:57,096 --> 01:00:00,236
SAM: All right, do you have your shit? Can we get
out of here?

915
01:00:00,236 --> 01:00:05,404
MATT: "Yes. Everything else here is of no interest
to me." She kicks one of the drums on the way out.

916
01:00:05,404 --> 01:00:07,256
Slips back into the hallway.

917
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:08,749
SAM: Anything you could use, Percival?

918
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:12,765
TALIESIN: Was there any more black powder? I've
taken all of her ammunition and black powder, I

919
01:00:12,765 --> 01:00:14,906
suppose. Anything else that looks useful to me?

920
01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:17,286
MATT: Make an investigation check.

921
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:21,877
TALIESIN: That's intelligence.

922
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:23,027
MATT: Yeah.

923
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,384
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, hell. Eight.

924
01:00:24,384 --> 01:00:31,991
MATT: Eight? You give a quick once-over of the
room. The place is pretty barren. Other than the

925
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:39,569
large drums of what seems like three inches of
some weird caustic substance at the bottom.

926
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,512
TALIESIN: I hate what you've done with the place.

927
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:45,358
MATT: It's a recurring substance. A lot of the
vials are based around it. There's a recurring

928
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,896
theme of this caustic liquid throughout all of her
instruments.

929
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:52,952
TALIESIN: We'll have a conversation about what she
was trying to do off-camera so I can have a better

930
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:54,372
understanding of it.

931
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:56,508
MATT: In what way?

932
01:00:56,508 --> 01:01:00,739
TALIESIN: I figure I may poke you later to get a
better understanding, just so we don't have to

933
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:07,659
bore other people with her technical
accoutrements, but I would like, at some point, an

934
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:12,674
out-of-character understanding of what I'm looking
at. Of what I could discern

935
01:01:12,674 --> 01:01:14,611
about what I'm looking at.

936
01:01:14,611 --> 01:01:16,094
MATT: Or we could have it on camera.

937
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:17,868
TALIESIN: All right. No, I just figured it'd be, I
don't want to--

938
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:19,259
(laughter)

939
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,346
TALIESIN: I want to kill something tonight.

940
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:23,080
LAURA: Yeah! We were also running out of time.

941
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,214
TALIESIN: Exactly.

942
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:27,150
LAURA: There are people fighting right now.

943
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,557
TALIESIN: Committed as much to memory as possible.
Let's go.

944
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:35,375
LAURA: When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come
back and explore this room to your heart's

945
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,276
content.

946
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,275
TALIESIN: Touche.

947
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:38,516
MARISHA: It'd still be your place.

948
01:01:38,516 --> 01:01:42,209
MATT: "Now, to your sister, is it?"

949
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:45,049
SAM: Up or down?

950
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:48,033
MATT: "This would be on the other side of this
floor."

951
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,369
TALIESIN: Which room?

952
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:57,510
MATT: "I think you know the room." And you know
that you're not too far from your sister's room.

953
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,472
MARISHA: They let her keep her room.

954
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:05,799
LIAM: See you later. I go stealth. 20. No, 23.

955
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:13,162
MATT: As you guys make your way across the other
side of the hallway, back toward the western side

956
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:19,039
of the castle, eventually finding where, not far
from where your room was, as well as the rooms of your

957
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:25,124
brother and Cassandra. They're all localized in
this one area of the castle, so you were all

958
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:29,765
nearby. She goes straight to Cassandra's room.
Goes to the door and doesn't touch it yet.

959
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:37,519
TALIESIN: A quick question before I open this
door. Am I going to have a violent reaction

960
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,617
towards you when I open it?

961
01:02:39,617 --> 01:02:42,128
MATT: "I certainly hope not."

962
01:02:42,128 --> 01:02:46,495
TALIESIN: Good. (sighs)

963
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:48,610
TRAVIS: I stand right behind her.

964
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:58,361
TALIESIN: I motion to everyone, stay back, open
the door, and I push Dr. Ripley into the room,

965
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:00,301
with me behind her.

966
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:07,754
MATT: Okay. As you pull the door open, (creak) you
push her in. The room is dark. There is no light.

967
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:13,565
What little bit of light that peeks in from the
hallways in the poorly-lit interior of the castle

968
01:03:13,565 --> 01:03:20,192
for this time of day. You can see there is her
canopy bed. You can see there is her cabinet in

969
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:23,162
the corner, but the room appears to be dark and
empty.

970
01:03:23,162 --> 01:03:26,143
TALIESIN: Torch.

971
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:29,500
MARISHA: Are there any wall sconces around? Torch
wall sconces on the outside?

972
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,140
MATT: There are a few along the walls that are
currently burnt out at this point.

973
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:38,258
TRAVIS: I take a torch out of the Bag of Holding
and I take the Firebrand War Hammer, ignite it,

974
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:40,219
and hand the torch to Percy.

975
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:48,320
MATT: Okay. You glance about the room. It's lived
in. The actual bed covers themselves are pulled

976
01:03:48,320 --> 01:04:00,306
off. You can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet
in the far corner. It's all put away. The chair's

977
01:04:00,306 --> 01:04:07,803
open a little, like it was stepped out of. The
room is absent of anyone.

978
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:11,117
TALIESIN: I walk over to the closet. I open it.

979
01:04:11,117 --> 01:04:18,714
MATT: Okay. You open the closet. She has outfits
there. Many of them don't appear to have been worn

980
01:04:18,714 --> 01:04:20,148
in a while.

981
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:24,682
TALIESIN: Looking for signs of life with the paper
on the desk.

982
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:27,170
MATT: You search her desk?

983
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,356
TALIESIN: Yes.

984
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:30,619
MATT: Make an investigation check.

985
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:32,295
TALIESIN: Let's have a real roll. That will do.

986
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:34,273
MARISHA: That's a really good roll.

987
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:36,093
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

988
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:37,413
TRAVIS: It is?

989
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:38,584
MARISHA: Yeah.

990
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,976
SAM: Classic Percy.

991
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:42,957
MATT: All right.

992
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:45,817
TALIESIN: It was doing this on Group Hug, man.

993
01:04:45,817 --> 01:04:55,801
MATT: You go through her vanity cabinet, and you
find there's small gems there. Just little

994
01:04:55,801 --> 01:05:05,402
keepsakes of hers. Things from her childhood. You
do find there is a tattered portrait of her and

995
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:11,767
your brothers and you that appears to be partially
burned on one side that is kept on its own at the

996
01:05:11,767 --> 01:05:20,555
bottom of the top shelf. You can see currently it
just shows half of your face, her next to you, and

997
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:24,333
your other three brothers to the side. The rest of
the family is burned off at the top point, but

998
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:28,761
this was once a portrait that was in one of the
hallways that apparently was destroyed in the

999
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:33,971
initial attack or since then. And she's kept this
scrap as some sort of memory and hid it within her

1000
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:35,002
cabinet.

1001
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:44,708
You also do find a stack of paper, a series of
partially-written notes and ink and quill that are

1002
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:50,538
false stops. Letters that were partially written
and then crossed off, or mistakes were made or

1003
01:05:50,538 --> 01:06:01,309
they never got finished that are all written to
Archibald. And they talk about the general unrest

1004
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:15,356
in the city. Preparation for a possible coming
rebellion. Discussing past failures but the intent

1005
01:06:15,356 --> 01:06:22,173
to try again. There's a theme through a lot of
these notes that this appears to be one of the

1006
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:27,545
methods she was using to communicate in the
outside of the castle, and was her role in

1007
01:06:27,545 --> 01:06:30,768
previous attempts at freeing the people of
Whitestone.

1008
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:34,282
TALIESIN: She's not here.

1009
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:40,034
MATT: You see Ripley's also like, "Well, if she's
not here, she's somewhere else in

1010
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:42,442
"the castle. I assume."

1011
01:06:42,442 --> 01:06:44,016
TALIESIN: Where would she be?

1012
01:06:44,016 --> 01:06:54,082
MATT: "I don't spend my time wondering or curious
about her well-being! I just know that she is

1013
01:06:54,082 --> 01:06:55,437
"usually here."

1014
01:06:55,437 --> 01:07:05,197
TALIESIN: Anna. I'm going to take a leap of faith
and believe, contrary to all evidence, that you

1015
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:16,708
are a smart woman. I pull out the gun, and I put
it to her head. Now. If you were the Briarwoods,

1016
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:20,372
where would you put my sister?

1017
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:29,967
LAURA: An important question here, Percy. Are they
keeping her, or is she here of her own volition?

1018
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:35,075
TALIESIN: I don't know. And if you don't know,
make me believe it.

1019
01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:47,610
MATT: "I know she's not allowed anywhere near the
ziggurat or near our distillery."

1020
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:50,359
TALIESIN: Distillery? I pull the gun away.

1021
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:56,452
MATT: She breathes a sigh of relief. "That's been
largely my project as part of this entire

1022
01:07:56,452 --> 01:08:11,999
"endeavor. All right, so when I was brought in
here, I was tasked to experiment with the design

1023
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:19,079
"and create large amounts of a very, very
delicately prepared acidic compound, one that

1024
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:27,598
"could dissolve the stone of your whitestone and
distill it down into pure residuum. This would allow

1025
01:08:27,598 --> 01:08:35,824
"the bulk creation of a very powerful magical
essence for use in construction materials that we

1026
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:42,874
"could instill and use apparently for this
ziggurat, as well as other such things. Thus, that

1027
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:50,392
"was my main reason for being here. We were ahead
of schedule, and I completed the bulk of our

1028
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:55,380
"development weeks ago, and I no longer had much of
a purpose here."

1029
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:06,044
MARISHA: Ahead of schedule? I'm sorry. Hi. By the
way, I'm Keyleth. We haven't really talked yet.

1030
01:09:06,044 --> 01:09:11,796
What schedule were you trying to keep? What was
the deadline?

1031
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:17,019
MATT: "We were trying to create enough continuous
acid to develop enough residuum to be used in the

1032
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:21,758
"reconstruction of the ziggurat. Once I had
developed enough of the compound to where we no

1033
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:28,460
"longer had to create more, my purpose was
complete. I had no interest beyond that. The rest

1034
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,647
"is gibberish to me."

1035
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:36,873
TALIESIN: So you're telling me that somewhere in this
castle there is a storage facility full of caustic

1036
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:40,721
acid that dissolves the very stones of this
castle?

1037
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:42,237
MATT: "Yes."

1038
01:09:42,237 --> 01:09:46,931
SAM: I reach out and I take out my potion of acid
resistance and I drink it.

1039
01:09:46,931 --> 01:09:49,413
(laughter)

1040
01:09:49,457 --> 01:09:59,951
MATT: Okay. Mark that. She looks at you, goes,
"Yes. If you've seen the vents of greenish fume

1041
01:09:59,951 --> 01:10:04,332
"billowing out in the garden, that is where the
distillery exhausts to."

1042
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:11,154
TALIESIN: Well, this is interesting.

1043
01:10:11,154 --> 01:10:14,821
LAURA: Ziggurat? What's it for?

1044
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:16,718
MARISHA: What exactly does it do?

1045
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:20,030
SAM: Hurry up. Time is of the essence.

1046
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:28,519
MATT: "I don't know. It has something to do with
the Briarwoods' interest in some third party.

1047
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:33,023
"Someone they've been working with. Someone I've
not met, someone who I have no interest in

1048
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:34,307
"inquiring within."

1049
01:10:34,307 --> 01:10:36,076
MARISHA: A name. Give us a name, girl.

1050
01:10:36,076 --> 01:10:39,851
MATT: "I was not given a name. They don't speak of
this individual's name. They are very secretive

1051
01:10:39,851 --> 01:10:43,979
"about it. They paid well, they gave me land, they
gave me a title, and when things were done, I was

1052
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:49,486
"to go free. Which is why I was not happy in which
the predicament you found me, made me."

1053
01:10:49,486 --> 01:10:51,339
TRAVIS: Where can we find this ziggurat?

1054
01:10:51,339 --> 01:11:00,842
MATT: Her eyes trail down to the floor. "The
ziggurat itself is, well, based on the tunneling

1055
01:11:00,842 --> 01:11:07,140
"structure, the distillery's direction? Right
beneath the city of Whitestone."

1056
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,074
TRAVIS: The city or this castle?

1057
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:12,603
MARISHA: They're going to destroy this fucking
city.

1058
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:14,173
LAURA: Is it underneath the Sun Tree?

1059
01:11:14,173 --> 01:11:18,732
MATT: "No, not the distillery. The ziggurat might
be."

1060
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,798
SAM: Wait, what?

1061
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:21,842
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

1062
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:24,445
MARISHA: They're going to-- yeah.

1063
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:30,245
TALIESIN: Are they still melting down the
whitestone for magical energy?

1064
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:38,771
MATT: "No, I don't believe so, not for weeks. We
finished that process for quite a bit now."

1065
01:11:38,771 --> 01:11:42,999
MARISHA: So you're done melting the whitestone,
but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic

1066
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,049
compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere?

1067
01:11:45,049 --> 01:11:49,470
MATT: "Well, not in a warehouse. That's all kept
stored underneath the garden of the castle."

1068
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:53,670
TRAVIS: We need to finish clearing this house now.
I don't know if they're even here.

1069
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,767
TALIESIN: We'd better move.

1070
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:56,494
SAM: Downstairs.

1071
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:57,589
TALIESIN: Downstairs.

1072
01:11:57,589 --> 01:12:01,689
MATT: "You were asking about Anders, though. Do
you wish to pay him a visit?"

1073
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,894
TALIESIN: (growls)

1074
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:06,479
MATT: You can see a smile on her face. She does
not like Anders.

1075
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,893
MARISHA: She's trying-- Percy? Percy, she's trying
to bait you. She's trying to waste time right now.

1076
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:12,674
Come on.

1077
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:14,243
MATT: "He was your sister's keeper."

1078
01:12:14,243 --> 01:12:17,645
MARISHA: She's trying to-- Percy, la la la. Percy,
come on.

1079
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:19,854
LAURA: He's probably with the Briarwoods.

1080
01:12:19,854 --> 01:12:21,580
MARISHA: Come on, he's not there.

1081
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,894
LIAM: I'm off sitting in the shadows, but I say,
Percival, we need to cut off the head.

1082
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:27,427
TALIESIN: Is it possible that my sister would be
with him?

1083
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,346
MATT: "It's very possible if she's not here."

1084
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:33,740
LAURA: Anna, shut. Up.

1085
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,851
MATT: "Very well."

1086
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:35,683
LAURA: Percival.

1087
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:37,622
MATT: "I only say because my whole--"

1088
01:12:37,622 --> 01:12:43,411
LAURA: "Anna!" And I notch an arrow and aim it
right at her throat. "Shut. Up."

1089
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:45,225
MARISHA: Percy?

1090
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:49,403
SAM: Where would this professor be?

1091
01:12:49,403 --> 01:12:52,630
MATT: "I imagine his study. It's around the
corner."

1092
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:55,639
TALIESIN: We'll check his study, and then we'll
go.

1093
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:56,744
MARISHA: No!

1094
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:58,146
TALIESIN: Just his study, then we'll go.

1095
01:12:58,146 --> 01:12:59,013
MARISHA: Percy!

1096
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:01,462
TALIESIN: Even if he's there, if she's not there,
we'll leave.

1097
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:02,771
TRAVIS: Go. Lead the way.

1098
01:13:02,771 --> 01:13:05,133
MARISHA: We're running out of time.

1099
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:06,816
LAURA: Brother, run and check the study.

1100
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:10,341
LIAM: I start running towards the direction that
was described.

1101
01:13:10,341 --> 01:13:11,996
LAURA: Let's go towards the under--

1102
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:13,289
TALIESIN: Very well.

1103
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,084
LAURA: Lead the way down.

1104
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:17,262
MATT: "Very well."

1105
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:19,143
LAURA: No talking.

1106
01:13:19,143 --> 01:13:20,693
SAM: Wait, we're going down?

1107
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:22,835
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not leaving Vax.

1108
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:25,182
LAURA: We're heading down. He's going to catch
up.

1109
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:32,640
MATT: She begins making her way towards the
landing that leads to the stairway down, whereas

1110
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,644
you stealth off in that direction. You find your
way around that corner. Go ahead and roll perception.

1111
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:43,412
LIAM: As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I
take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap

1112
01:13:43,412 --> 01:13:50,469
and put it on, and I also whip out this other
cloak that I've been looking at and whip it

1113
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,860
around. You're not here. And now continue on.

1114
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,774
MATT: All right. So both will attune to you at
your next short rest.

1115
01:13:54,774 --> 01:13:56,583
LIAM: Yes, all right, excellent. It's fine.

1116
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,481
LAURA: Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before.

1117
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:03,232
LIAM: There's two things. Moving forward.

1118
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:05,604
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

1119
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:09,421
LIAM: That is 22.

1120
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:15,908
MATT: All right, as you make your way down the
hallway, you hear what sounds like a muffled

1121
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:23,603
female voice from behind a distant doorway. Like a
small cry in pain or worry.

1122
01:14:23,603 --> 01:14:26,966
LIAM: Do I need to stealth again, or am I already
stealthed?

1123
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:29,655
MATT: You rolled stealth before this.

1124
01:14:29,655 --> 01:14:31,382
LIAM: Yeah. It was like 23 before.

1125
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:32,409
MATT: Yeah.

1126
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:35,027
LIAM: So I'm going to move toward that sound.
Carefully.

1127
01:14:35,027 --> 01:14:41,445
MATT: Okay. It leads down. There are three
doorways on this side of the hallway. The central

1128
01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:46,284
door there is where you hear the noise coming
from.

1129
01:14:46,284 --> 01:14:52,883
LIAM: Okay, I'm sticking my ear to the door, and
I'm going to listen for a full minute to see what

1130
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:54,035
I hear.

1131
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:59,835
MATT: You hear a little bit of quiet and a light
sobbing. Then you hear another voice, a male voice,

1132
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:05,806
an older voice, just say quickly, "Shh! You be
quiet until you're told to speak.

1133
01:15:05,806 --> 01:15:08,659
"They should be close."

1134
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:13,963
LIAM: I want to gently try the door handle.

1135
01:15:13,963 --> 01:15:19,045
MATT: Okay. It is not locked. It does turn.

1136
01:15:19,045 --> 01:15:24,077
LIAM: I want to push it like one inch in and try
to peek in.

1137
01:15:24,077 --> 01:15:25,521
SAM: Just the tip.

1138
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,778
LAURA: Don't.

1139
01:15:26,778 --> 01:15:28,269
MARISHA: I'm having deja vu.

1140
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:29,962
LAURA: I know. We've been here before.

1141
01:15:29,962 --> 01:15:35,282
MATT: You glance inside the room, and it's a nice
study, and there is a fireplace on one side that

1142
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:40,309
is part of a continuation of a two-story fireplace
column that goes up through the castle on this

1143
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:44,240
side. There are shelves of books, there is a desk
in the far corner, there's a couple of chairs

1144
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:50,390
laying around. From this side, from what you can
see, in the center to the back of the room is an

1145
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:59,869
older gentleman wearing a breastplate. You can see
his very short gray hair, a little bit of facial

1146
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:03,831
hair that's grown in but not to a full beard. It
looks like it's been left to go on its own for a

1147
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:09,834
little while. And he's currently holding a young
woman, roughly early twenties or so with dark

1148
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:15,297
brown hair with a couple streaks of white through
the sides of the temple. Holding her by her hair

1149
01:16:15,297 --> 01:16:26,419
with a dagger to her throat, saying, "Shh! Now.
When I tell you, you'll say what I told you to

1150
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:31,361
"say. Got it?"

1151
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:34,613
And you can see she has tears streaking down her
face she's like (gasping).

1152
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:44,407
LIAM: I back up about five steps and very quietly
say, Jenga.

1153
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:47,428
(laughter)

1154
01:16:47,428 --> 01:16:51,810
LIAM: And I run at the door and I kick it open and
throw at him.

1155
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:53,099
SAM: Yeah!

1156
01:16:53,099 --> 01:16:59,314
TALIESIN: Well, that happened.

1157
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:00,568
SAM: Yeah.

1158
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:02,194
MATT: All righty.

1159
01:17:02,194 --> 01:17:03,484
LAURA: So we take off running towards him.

1160
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:11,432
MARISHA: Here we go. Jenga. Fucking asshole.

1161
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:13,454
(laughter)

1162
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:14,664
TALIESIN: Dick!

1163
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,402
MARISHA: It's a trap. It's such a trap.

1164
01:17:16,402 --> 01:17:17,551
SAM: Of course.

1165
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:23,619
MATT: All right. (laughs) So you have a surprise
round.

1166
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:24,931
LIAM: Yeah.

1167
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,697
MARISHA: Come on, Sneak Attack.

1168
01:17:26,697 --> 01:17:31,177
MATT: Both those individuals right there. Go ahead
and make your attack.

1169
01:17:31,177 --> 01:17:33,626
LIAM: What am I looking at?

1170
01:17:33,626 --> 01:17:37,065
MATT: Okay, so as you burst in. You can see the
man's holding, there's the desk behind him, right

1171
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:41,346
there. Papers and stuff scattered on there.
There's some tables around with some chairs. There

1172
01:17:41,346 --> 01:17:45,594
are these large bookshelves that hold this side
and there's the fireplace in the far corner right

1173
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:51,249
there. Flames. Warming the room. There's a small
chandelier on the ceiling that has magical light

1174
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:56,481
emanating from it that gives the room this warm
glow. You don't care right now because you're

1175
01:17:56,481 --> 01:17:58,040
throwing a fucking dagger.

1176
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,823
LIAM: Right. But he's behind her a bit, right?

1177
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:01,769
MATT: Yeah, he's holding her right there with a
dagger to her throat.

1178
01:18:01,769 --> 01:18:07,224
LIAM: Well, I recently added the sharpshooter
feat, so three-quarter and half cover means

1179
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:12,646
nothing to me. So I'm going to aim for his eye
that's peeking out the side. All three are

1180
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,784
going right in his eye.

1181
01:18:14,784 --> 01:18:16,057
MATT: Okay.

1182
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:20,609
LIAM: So here's the first. The first is 24.

1183
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:22,844
MATT: That'll hit.

1184
01:18:22,844 --> 01:18:29,033
LIAM: Okay, the second is 26. As you can tell,
I've been screaming monster sounds. My voice is a

1185
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:30,637
little ragged. 26 on the second.

1186
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:32,345
MATT: Hits.

1187
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:34,568
LIAM: And 16 on the third.

1188
01:18:34,568 --> 01:18:38,743
MATT: 16 misses. But the first two strike true.

1189
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:52,277
LIAM: The first, it's three plus seven is ten.
Plus 14, 20, 26, 29, 33, 39. That's the first one.

1190
01:18:52,277 --> 01:19:01,029
And then the second one does four plus six is ten.
Oh! But it's surprise, so the first one is doubled

1191
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,712
because it's automatically a crit.

1192
01:19:02,712 --> 01:19:06,367
MATT: All right, so what's that now?

1193
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:14,043
LIAM: Well, it was 39, so now it's 60, 78. For the
first one. Ten for the second.

1194
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:15,393
TALIESIN: I love you.

1195
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:21,214
MATT: Okay. So 88 points of damage. You just went
80 miles per hour on your first turn. As you kick

1196
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:27,416
the doors open. (whoosh) The first dagger, he sees
it coming towards him for a second and attempts to

1197
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:31,253
dodge out of the way, and as he moves this eye out
of the way, the dagger (impact noise) right into

1198
01:19:31,253 --> 01:19:37,356
this one, he screams out (screaming) in pain as it
just plunges into his eye socket. Not deep enough

1199
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:41,896
to actually hit any brain, but enough to
definitely take that eye out as any sort of viable

1200
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:48,142
method. The second one just hits him in the
shoulder and a reaction to that, Cassandra screams

1201
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:54,788
out, "No, run! It's a trap!" At which point, he
takes his dagger and just

1202
01:19:54,788 --> 01:19:56,508
runs it across her throat.

1203
01:19:56,508 --> 01:19:59,375
LAURA: (softly) I don't think it's her. 
It's not her.

1204
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:04,661
MATT: You see crimson start to pour down the front
as she (choking). Go ahead and roll initiative.

1205
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:14,544
LIAM: All right. I'm going to do luck. Yeah.
That's a 22.

1206
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:16,595
TALIESIN: Why would she be saying it's a trap if
it's not her?

1207
01:20:16,595 --> 01:20:18,048
LAURA: Could be a peasant.

1208
01:20:18,048 --> 01:20:28,617
MATT: All right. Okay. So you're going first.
Also, at this point as you throw the dagger,

1209
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:35,618
you're still at the doorway and you hear what
sounds like two sources of metal clanking

1210
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:42,716
together. You can't really see a source, but you
hear other sounds in the room. What are you doing

1211
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:44,084
with your action?

1212
01:20:47,684 --> 01:20:55,343
LIAM: I am running at him and stabbing the shit
out of him.

1213
01:20:55,343 --> 01:21:03,481
MATT: Okay, as you cross this boundary, I need you
to go ahead and immediately make a constitution

1214
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:04,712
saving throw.

1215
01:21:04,712 --> 01:21:09,659
LIAM: I'll use luck again. Yeah.

1216
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:11,342
SAM: That's two lucks.

1217
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:14,251
LIAM: That's 17 for constitution saving throw.

1218
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:18,912
MATT: Great. All right, so as you step across the
threshold of the room, the tile in front of you

1219
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:23,751
all of a sudden bursts in a flash of blue,
painfully cold energy, like there's a concentrated

1220
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:26,060
moment of shredding ice.

1221
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,589
LIAM: Am I able to use evasion for that?

1222
01:21:28,589 --> 01:21:30,005
MATT: You can, technically.

1223
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:31,567
LIAM: So if I succeed, I take no damage.

1224
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:37,396
MATT: Correct. Okay, so you take no damage. You
dart across, just managing to use that momentum

1225
01:21:37,396 --> 01:21:41,429
and your intensity toward this horrible moment
that just happened before you. And you feel the

1226
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:45,964
explosion happen behind you. You just manage to
pass beyond it. You rush forward to him. All

1227
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:52,393
right. And he's dropped her to the ground now.
She's fallen onto her hands and knees.

1228
01:21:52,393 --> 01:21:55,195
LIAM: I'm going into his guts.

1229
01:21:55,195 --> 01:21:56,370
MATT: Okay.

1230
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:04,311
LIAM: So first attack is a 25, second attack is a
20, and the third attack is a 26.

1231
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:06,823
One, two, three?

1232
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:08,268
MATT: One, two, three.

1233
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:11,687
LIAM: Oh, and I'm going to turn the poison on for
the poison dagger, which I'm going to use for the

1234
01:22:11,687 --> 01:22:12,774
second.

1235
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:14,813
LAURA: Just flip the little switch.

1236
01:22:14,813 --> 01:22:27,204
LIAM: Well, it just drips. So nine for the first,
eight for the second, plus the poison is-- shit, I

1237
01:22:27,204 --> 01:22:32,402
didn't copy it down here. I think it's 1d12. Let's
say it's 1d12, because I can't remember. If anyone

1238
01:22:32,402 --> 01:22:39,569
wants to correct me, they can. Five points of
poison added to the five is 13. And then the last

1239
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:43,077
dagger is nine.

1240
01:22:43,077 --> 01:22:48,631
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up to him and shank him
repeatedly in the side, the breastplates

1241
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:52,330
deflecting part of the blow, but you're managing
to find openings in the side, and you go for a

1242
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:56,390
shoulder and jam it underneath his arm, through
his ribcage, and he screams out (yelps) in pain,

1243
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:02,123
and you can see there's blood pouring out the
side of his mouth. And the dagger's returned by

1244
01:23:02,123 --> 01:23:05,637
now, but there's this giant gaping, bleeding wound
on the side of his face where one of his eyes is

1245
01:23:05,637 --> 01:23:12,446
completely ruined. He looks both surprised,
angered, and very, very confused about the way

1246
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,178
things suddenly happened.

1247
01:23:14,178 --> 01:23:15,608
LIAM: Hello.

1248
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:19,732
MATT: All right so that's your turn.

1249
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:20,979
LIAM: That's it, I'm out.

1250
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:23,096
MATT: Okay, he's going to go.

1251
01:23:23,096 --> 01:23:27,720
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

1252
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:33,384
LIAM: We're six seconds in, Taliesin.

1253
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:40,015
MATT: First off, there were two sets of
decorative armor on the sides of the wall that

1254
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:45,225
suddenly have filled with some sort of reddish
arcane energy that gives them a solid physical

1255
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:49,383
form, and they both step off their pedestals and
begin (heavy impact) making their way towards you.

1256
01:23:49,383 --> 01:23:53,284
But before all that happens, Professor Anders in
front of you, wounded and not looking terribly

1257
01:23:53,284 --> 01:24:04,632
happy at the moment, is going to use his action to
attempt to cast Confusion on you. So he goes to

1258
01:24:04,632 --> 01:24:12,509
step back, and (grunting) just releases his hand
in front of you as one functioning eye bores into

1259
01:24:12,509 --> 01:24:17,403
you as he screams out. You can feel the pressure
towards your head. Go ahead and make a wisdom

1260
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:18,799
saving throw.

1261
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:21,085
LIAM: Wisdom, which I have advantage.

1262
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:23,560
MATT: Well, wisdom saving throw because of that
anyway, so.

1263
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,446
LIAM: That is a 20.

1264
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:32,242
MATT: A 20? The effect shrugs off. Nothing on you.
He is going to attempt to step back--

1265
01:24:32,242 --> 01:24:33,726
LIAM: Oh, attack him.

1266
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:35,505
MATT: So you get attack of opportunity on him.

1267
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:38,433
LIAM: Yeah, it's a 22.

1268
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:40,206
MATT: 22? Okay, that does hit.

1269
01:24:40,206 --> 01:24:42,446
LIAM: Eight.

1270
01:24:42,446 --> 01:24:55,361
MATT: Okay. He will use his bonus action and he--
let me look up the definition of it real fast.

1271
01:24:55,361 --> 01:25:02,223
Okay, takes a bonus action as he steps back,
"(grunts) Come. Take this inspiration to defeat my

1272
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:10,295
foe!" And he lends an inspiration dice to one of
the armored creatures stepping forward towards

1273
01:25:10,295 --> 01:25:19,236
you. Now it's their turn. Both these armored
creatures pull out swords, and they lift up the

1274
01:25:19,236 --> 01:25:26,372
shields that they had to their sides, and they
rush into you from two sides right there. You see

1275
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:30,414
this as they rush up to you: they're not really
touching the ground, they're gliding across it. So

1276
01:25:30,414 --> 01:25:41,275
the first one is going to attempt to strike you
with two attacks of its longsword. That is a 14?

1277
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:42,370
LIAM: No.

1278
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,811
MATT: Second one is a 17.

1279
01:25:44,811 --> 01:25:45,885
LIAM: No.

1280
01:25:45,885 --> 01:25:51,970
MATT: All right. The second one now is going to go
ahead and take two swings at you. That is an 18.

1281
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:54,595
LIAM: Yeah, but I'll use uncanny dodge.

1282
01:25:54,595 --> 01:25:55,814
MATT: To reduce the damage by half?

1283
01:25:55,814 --> 01:25:56,479
LIAM: Yeah.

1284
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:03,563
MATT: Okay, so the first strike hits you for 13
points of slashing damage.

1285
01:26:03,563 --> 01:26:06,219
LIAM: So, half that or all of that?

1286
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:07,335
MATT: That'll be half that.

1287
01:26:07,335 --> 01:26:08,794
LIAM: Half that. Okay, so seven.

1288
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:12,315
MATT: There you go. And then that's going to be a
24 to hit.

1289
01:26:12,315 --> 01:26:14,277
LIAM: That hits, yeah.

1290
01:26:14,277 --> 01:26:22,004
MATT: And this is not halved. Okay, that's 12
points of slashing damage.

1291
01:26:22,004 --> 01:26:24,239
LIAM: All right.

1292
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:36,216
MATT: Okay, now to Cassandra's turn. She is on the
ground just spilling out her life essence onto the

1293
01:26:36,216 --> 01:26:39,273
ground. She's clutching at her throat and is like
(gasping). You hear that horrible sucking sound of

1294
01:26:39,273 --> 01:26:50,705
her feeling her life drain from her. She's not
unconscious, but she doesn't have long for this

1295
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:55,394
world. All right, that brings us to the top of the
round. The rest of you guys are now rushing, I

1296
01:26:55,394 --> 01:27:01,004
assume, dash motion, making your way as fast as
you can to that side. Due to distance, you would

1297
01:27:01,004 --> 01:27:04,997
all get to the end of this hallway, about there.

1298
01:27:08,927 --> 01:27:11,155
TALIESIN: Is that including sprint?

1299
01:27:11,155 --> 01:27:14,343
MATT: Well, the dash action, yeah.

1300
01:27:14,343 --> 01:27:15,862
TALIESIN: That's full dash?

1301
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:18,766
MATT: This is your movement and then dash action,
you guys, because you guys were down in this area,

1302
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:25,718
heading down the stairs. You just made it up and
over. And this is Ripley. We'll use that for

1303
01:27:25,718 --> 01:27:34,930
Ripley for now. Everyone else roll initiative.
We're in a new combat round.

1304
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,925
TALIESIN: What the hell!?

1305
01:27:36,925 --> 01:27:40,247
MARISHA: Oh! Percy's pissed.

1306
01:27:40,247 --> 01:27:41,691
TALIESIN: I Percy'd again.

1307
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:42,584
MARISHA: He Percy'd.

1308
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:44,158
MATT: Who got him that dice?

1309
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:46,071
(laughter)

1310
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:47,781
TRAVIS: The golden snitch is powerful.

1311
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:53,613
TALIESIN: No, I was on Group Hug last week with
somebody else's dice, and it was comedy.

1312
01:27:53,613 --> 01:27:54,893
LAURA: It's just you, Taliesin.

1313
01:27:54,893 --> 01:27:57,397
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1314
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,664
MATT: You are the anti-Wheaton.

1315
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:00,200
TALIESIN: I'm the anti-Wheaton.

1316
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,207
MATT: If you guys were to play in the same group,
all RPGs would fold into themselves and no longer

1317
01:28:04,207 --> 01:28:10,533
exist. It's like the end of Timecop. It'll be
terrible. Okay, so initiatives. We have 25 to 20?

1318
01:28:10,533 --> 01:28:11,593
TALIESIN: 28.

1319
01:28:11,593 --> 01:28:12,659
MATT: 28.

1320
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:13,656
TRAVIS: 21.

1321
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:15,590
MATT: 21. Remember your advantage, by the way.

1322
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,826
TRAVIS: That's the second roll.

1323
01:28:16,826 --> 01:28:19,800
MATT: All right, so Percy at the top.

1324
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,004
TRAVIS: Feral instinct.

1325
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:24,936
MATT: All right, and you were at-- I think your
initiative was 20?

1326
01:28:24,936 --> 01:28:27,974
LIAM: I don't remember. It was early 20s.

1327
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:33,839
MATT: Early 20s, yeah, so it'd be Percy, Vax. 20
to 15?

1328
01:28:33,839 --> 01:28:34,756
MARISHA: 13.

1329
01:28:34,756 --> 01:28:35,870
SAM: 19.

1330
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:37,027
MATT: 19.

1331
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:46,399
MARISHA: Oh wait, sorry. Might have jumped the gun
a bit there. I'm excited. Sorry. I'm bringing up

1332
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:48,884
the ranks anyway, I think. It's fine.

1333
01:28:56,124 --> 01:29:00,098
MATT: Keyleth, all right. Vex, what'd you get?

1334
01:29:00,098 --> 01:29:01,147
LAURA: 11.

1335
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:02,009
MATT: 11.

1336
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:03,017
LIAM: I'm Vax.

1337
01:29:03,017 --> 01:29:06,945
MATT: I know, I said Vex! I got it right this
time!

1338
01:29:06,945 --> 01:29:07,943
LIAM: Oh, you're from California.

1339
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:11,281
LAURA: Yeah. (laughing)

1340
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:21,081
MATT: Technically, I'm from Florida. All right, so
Percy, you're up first.

1341
01:29:21,081 --> 01:29:24,693
TALIESIN: Can I drag Ripley with me?

1342
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,374
MATT: You can, but you'll be moving half
movement.

1343
01:29:27,374 --> 01:29:28,294
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1344
01:29:28,294 --> 01:29:31,020
TRAVIS: Leave her. Somebody else--

1345
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:39,978
TALIESIN: So as my bonus action before anything
happens I'm going to tell her, she lives, you

1346
01:29:40,078 --> 01:29:46,320
show us where the entrance to the caverns are, you
walk with your things. And run.

1347
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,797
LAURA: She was trying to set us up in this trap.
You do understand that?

1348
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:53,343
MARISHA: Oh yeah, she's all about this fucking
shit.

1349
01:29:53,343 --> 01:29:54,167
MATT: Full movement?

1350
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:55,106
TALIESIN: Full movement.

1351
01:29:55,106 --> 01:29:59,895
MATT: Okay, that's your full turn there. All
right, that ends your turn, Percy.

1352
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:04,691
LIAM: I have one healing potion left, and I'm
going to take it and stick it into this girl's

1353
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:08,709
mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her
neck as well.

1354
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:10,379
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1355
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:12,585
MARISHA: Maybe hold her neck. Make sure it goes
down.

1356
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:19,633
MATT: Well, you have to roll to heal. You pull
back, and it's a really unsettling thing as you

1357
01:30:19,633 --> 01:30:21,826
pull up her head to try and feed her the potion.

1358
01:30:21,826 --> 01:30:25,379
LIAM: It's 2d4?

1359
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:26,890
MATT: It's just a regular healing potion?

1360
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:32,309
LIAM: Yeah, regular. It's the lowest of the rung.
Moderate? I think it's called moderate?

1361
01:30:32,309 --> 01:30:34,649
MATT: Sorry, got it right here. That's 2d4 plus
two.

1362
01:30:34,649 --> 01:30:46,966
LIAM: So four. Six. And then I want to step in
front of her, between her and that one, and then

1363
01:30:47,016 --> 01:30:48,217
stab the one.

1364
01:30:48,217 --> 01:30:51,860
MATT: Okay, as you take the potion, it's a messy
process. You get most of it in her, but some of it

1365
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:59,240
drips on the ground, but the wound seems to close.
All the blood goes away on the ground around her

1366
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,699
neck from the splashing of the potion, which has
vanished entirely, and you can see she's

1367
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:04,343
(gasping).

1368
01:31:04,343 --> 01:31:05,674
LAURA: That's good.

1369
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:07,933
MATT: She's right on the edge, but she's looking
pretty rough.

1370
01:31:07,933 --> 01:31:09,745
LIAM: So is that the bonus action, or is that the
action?

1371
01:31:09,745 --> 01:31:10,873
MATT: That was your action.

1372
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:19,480
LIAM: Action, okay. By the way, I'm realizing I
didn't click my boots, so I did one two three

1373
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:24,263
before, and the third one missed, so luckily that
worked out, but I'm not clicking those.

1374
01:31:24,263 --> 01:31:26,911
MATT: Thank you for the reminder. So used to
dagger, dagger, dagger. I'm like, "Wait, no."

1375
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:29,746
LIAM: So I just step between them, and that's all
I can do, yeah?

1376
01:31:29,746 --> 01:31:33,246
MATT: Okay, so you move into there, great. That's
your turn.

1377
01:31:33,246 --> 01:31:35,631
LIAM: No, I mean between her and the closest one
to her.

1378
01:31:35,631 --> 01:31:38,773
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we've got this new thing now.
That's so much better.

1379
01:31:38,773 --> 01:31:45,577
MATT: For those who don't know, we have a top-down
camera for the players, which is really helpful

1380
01:31:45,577 --> 01:31:46,682
for them to know--

1381
01:31:46,682 --> 01:31:47,769
LAURA: What's going on.

1382
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:48,700
MATT: So you move.

1383
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:50,687
LIAM: I was hoping to stand in front of her, yeah.
Like that.

1384
01:31:50,687 --> 01:31:54,524
MATT: So you push her aside and get in between the
two, okay. Cool, that ends your turn.

1385
01:31:54,524 --> 01:31:56,136
Grog, you're up.

1386
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:57,350
TRAVIS: Dead sprint after Percy.

1387
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,575
MATT: Okay, and your speed is?

1388
01:31:58,575 --> 01:31:59,580
TRAVIS: 50.

1389
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,882
LIAM and TALIESIN: (heavy footsteps)

1390
01:32:01,882 --> 01:32:08,615
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1391
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:10,248
MARISHA: What's up, Grog?

1392
01:32:10,248 --> 01:32:15,335
MATT: You can get all the way up into here, but
that's all you can do this turn. Yeah, so you're

1393
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:22,070
(heavy footsteps) bounding down the hall. You push
past Percy and rush into the room, and you see a

1394
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:30,022
young girl on the ground, doubled over, barely
conscious. You see Vax stepping in front of these

1395
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:36,911
weird, glowing armored creatures, and at the back
of the room, there's a man with bleeding, gaping

1396
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:38,237
eye socket.

1397
01:32:38,237 --> 01:32:39,679
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you do?

1398
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:40,714
LIAM: Welcome to the party.

1399
01:32:40,714 --> 01:32:42,177
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

1400
01:32:42,177 --> 01:32:47,419
SAM: I'm up? I run as fast as my little legs will
take me. 25.

1401
01:32:47,419 --> 01:32:48,824
MATT: There you go.

1402
01:32:48,824 --> 01:32:59,950
SAM: I can't see them, so I'll just inspire--
Who's going to get in there next? Who's behind me?

1403
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:06,019
Can I inspire people that I can't see?

1404
01:33:06,019 --> 01:33:08,319
MATT: I think they have to be in your sight.

1405
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:13,783
TALIESIN: You can see me, though whether or not
you want to inspire me at this point is definitely

1406
01:33:13,783 --> 01:33:15,112
debatable.

1407
01:33:15,544 --> 01:33:18,996
MATT: You can inspire somebody else in the hallway, if
you'd like.

1408
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:22,277
SAM: All right. They can't even make it in the
next turn, right?

1409
01:33:22,277 --> 01:33:24,343
MARISHA: No, but we'll keep it.

1410
01:33:24,343 --> 01:33:43,150
SAM: Sure. I will inspire Vex, behind me, and I'll
say, (sings) Arrows and bows, they fire at our

1411
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:50,398
foes and kill them, and they make them ghosts.
They won't let go.

1412
01:33:50,398 --> 01:33:52,302
SAM and LAURA: (sing) Arrows and bows!

1413
01:33:52,302 --> 01:34:01,442
MATT: As the beat hits you, you feel yourself a
little more sure shot with any arrows. Take your

1414
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:03,006
d10 inspiration die.

1415
01:34:03,006 --> 01:34:07,014
LIAM: Forearms go (explosion noises).

1416
01:34:07,014 --> 01:34:09,314
(laughter)

1417
01:34:09,314 --> 01:34:20,611
MATT: All righty. So, that brings us to-- all
right. Professor Anders, now, is taking his turn.

1418
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:22,416
MARISHA: Professor Anders.

1419
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,443
SAM: Professor Anders.

1420
01:34:24,443 --> 01:34:26,085
MARISHA: Professor Anders.

1421
01:34:26,085 --> 01:34:29,813
LIAM: Mr. Anderson.

1422
01:34:29,813 --> 01:34:35,793
MATT: He sees this giant creature in the room
looming and he reaches up and closes up one eye

1423
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:42,985
and goes, "You. Do this for me." And as he looks
at you for a second, he releases another spell and

1424
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:49,108
you feel a familiar arcane grasp begin to curl
over the back of your mind. Go ahead and roll a

1425
01:34:49,108 --> 01:34:51,815
wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your
Heroes' Feast.

1426
01:34:51,815 --> 01:34:53,553
TRAVIS: All right, okay.

1427
01:34:53,553 --> 01:34:57,643
LIAM: Come on, baby. One more time.

1428
01:34:57,643 --> 01:35:01,545
TRAVIS: 14.

1429
01:35:01,545 --> 01:35:07,184
MATT: 14. Your brain, not tempered against these
types of magics and having previously failed you

1430
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:11,706
before. You feel your will no longer become your
own as now you are an instrument of destruction

1431
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:16,539
controlled by Professor Anders. You've been
Dominated.

1432
01:35:16,539 --> 01:35:17,413
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1433
01:35:17,413 --> 01:35:18,551
LAURA: Fuck!

1434
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:22,504
SAM: Oh no. Dominate goliath.

1435
01:35:22,504 --> 01:35:24,478
LAURA: We've got to kill that motherfucker!

1436
01:35:24,478 --> 01:35:34,296
MATT: Okay. I mean, he looks to you and goes,
"Kill that one!" And points to Vax, and you look

1437
01:35:34,296 --> 01:35:38,505
down at Vax with a grin as the blood-letting
you've wanted so bad,

1438
01:35:38,505 --> 01:35:39,959
your target lies before you.

1439
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:41,276
SAM: Hulk versus Wolverine!

1440
01:35:41,276 --> 01:35:44,545
(laughter)

1441
01:35:44,545 --> 01:35:45,790
MATT: Ending Anders's turn--

1442
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:48,298
TALIESIN: Remember what he did to your beard.

1443
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:51,554
TRAVIS: I know, is it me grinning, or is it
dominated Grog?

1444
01:35:51,554 --> 01:35:53,553
(laughter)

1445
01:35:53,553 --> 01:35:54,815
MATT: Moves to here.

1446
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:57,074
TALIESIN: Hulk versus Wolverine, man. I'm excited
by that.

1447
01:35:57,074 --> 01:36:00,301
MATT: Both of these horrors move and shift around
now at this moment to get on each sides of you,

1448
01:36:00,301 --> 01:36:07,077
giving them both a flanking bonus. Now it's four
strikes, longsword against you, with advantage.

1449
01:36:07,077 --> 01:36:09,460
Double eights. Can't roll shit!

1450
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,607
LIAM: Why advantage? I'm just curious. Give it to
me, but what's the advantage from?

1451
01:36:12,607 --> 01:36:15,196
MATT: They have advantage against you because they
moved into flanking position.

1452
01:36:15,196 --> 01:36:16,305
LIAM: Because they're in flanking. Got it.

1453
01:36:16,305 --> 01:36:22,611
MATT: Which, for those who're curious about it, it
is an optional rule in the DMG. It exists. Second

1454
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:25,580
attack. Three and a four. I can't roll!

1455
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,548
TALIESIN: (sucking sounds)

1456
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:30,516
MATT: So this guy just whiffs with both of his
weapon strikes.

1457
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:31,857
MARISHA: You're sucking his energy?

1458
01:36:31,857 --> 01:36:33,349
TALIESIN: (raspy) I have your power.

1459
01:36:33,349 --> 01:36:35,653
MATT: Natural 20 on the next strike.

1460
01:36:35,653 --> 01:36:37,704
LAURA and MARISHA: Spoke too soon.

1461
01:36:37,704 --> 01:36:38,944
MATT: Two natural 20s.

1462
01:36:38,944 --> 01:36:40,195
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1463
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:44,816
MATT: It was a miss and a natural 20 on the first
attack, and then a natural 20 on the first roll of

1464
01:36:44,816 --> 01:36:45,680
the second attack.

1465
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,980
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm sorry.

1466
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,939
MARISHA: Spoke too soon.

1467
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:49,569
MATT: So you take on the first hit--

1468
01:36:49,569 --> 01:36:51,965
MARISHA: You mock fate, fate punches you in the
mouth.

1469
01:36:51,965 --> 01:37:02,644
MATT: That would be 16 points of slashing damage,
and 20 points of slashing damage with the second

1470
01:37:02,644 --> 01:37:08,269
strike, so a total of 36 points of slashing
damage. And you can feel this strange, angry

1471
01:37:08,269 --> 01:37:14,652
vibrating growl coming from within this unhallowed
armor that floats before you. That ends their go.

1472
01:37:14,652 --> 01:37:16,112
Keyleth, you're up.

1473
01:37:16,112 --> 01:37:22,730
MARISHA: I'm running like hell. Running, running,
running. Can I see? Can I peek around the corner

1474
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:23,710
just to see?

1475
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,602
MATT: You can just peek around the corner and see
the circumstance.

1476
01:37:25,602 --> 01:37:26,651
MARISHA: Can I see Cassandra?

1477
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:27,723
MATT: You do, yes.

1478
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:28,855
MARISHA: Healing Word.

1479
01:37:28,855 --> 01:37:30,184
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll.

1480
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:31,204
SAM: Do you know it's her?

1481
01:37:31,204 --> 01:37:32,379
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1482
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:33,724
LAURA: Either way. Whoever it is.

1483
01:37:33,724 --> 01:37:34,874
SAM: Do you know what she looks like?

1484
01:37:34,874 --> 01:37:35,846
TRAVIS: Just do what you're going to do.

1485
01:37:35,846 --> 01:37:36,844
LAURA: Just do it.

1486
01:37:36,844 --> 01:37:37,585
SAM: Okay.

1487
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:38,503
MARISHA: Healing Word.

1488
01:37:38,503 --> 01:37:39,403
TALIESIN: Family resemblance.

1489
01:37:39,403 --> 01:37:40,251
MARISHA: Family resemblance.

1490
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:45,378
MATT: I'd say given the circumstances, you have an
inkling that someone's in danger there. And the

1491
01:37:45,378 --> 01:37:47,194
calling of Jenga. So go for it.

1492
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:53,655
MARISHA: I'll cast it-- no, I'm just going to keep
it at 1st level for now. I'm going to save my

1493
01:37:53,655 --> 01:38:04,371
higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to
cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my

1494
01:38:04,371 --> 01:38:11,898
spellcaster. Three. That's not too bad. No, sorry.
16? No, 13.

1495
01:38:11,898 --> 01:38:16,907
MATT: 13? Okay, good to know. All righty. That's
your turn. Vex, you're up.

1496
01:38:16,907 --> 01:38:26,859
LAURA: So I'm with Anna. Trinket-- I tell him to
hold onto her and drag her along with us.

1497
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,210
MATT: Okay.

1498
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:30,389
LAURA: So he clamps down on her arm.

1499
01:38:30,389 --> 01:38:34,405
MATT: So one, two. He's going to attempt to
grapple her. Go ahead and roll an athletics check

1500
01:38:34,405 --> 01:38:39,498
with advantage because she's not expecting it.

1501
01:38:39,498 --> 01:38:44,280
LAURA: 16?

1502
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:50,517
MATT: Okay. Trinket grabs onto the scruff of her
coat and begins pushing forward. They both get the

1503
01:38:50,517 --> 01:38:53,665
rest of half of his movement because he's forcing
her forward. That's as far as he can get.

1504
01:38:53,665 --> 01:38:55,732
LAURA: But I can keep running? I can run all the
way up?

1505
01:38:55,732 --> 01:38:57,892
MATT: What's your speed? Is it 30?

1506
01:38:57,892 --> 01:38:58,926
LAURA: 30.

1507
01:38:58,926 --> 01:39:05,141
MATT: You get about there, right at the edge.

1508
01:39:05,141 --> 01:39:06,451
LAURA: So I can shoot an arrow?

1509
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:09,645
MATT: No, that's your movement and then your dash
action to get there.

1510
01:39:09,645 --> 01:39:10,659
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1511
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:22,751
MATT: All right. Ripley is just going to stay put
for the time being. She's held by a bear and being

1512
01:39:22,751 --> 01:39:24,620
pushed along. She's just "Ugh."

1513
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,911
TALIESIN: With no weapons and no armor.

1514
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:27,474
MATT: Leather armor, basically.

1515
01:39:27,474 --> 01:39:28,490
TALIESIN: Leather armor, yeah.

1516
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:31,456
MATT: Percy, you're up.

1517
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:38,606
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in. I can move six,
right?

1518
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:40,827
MATT: You can move six squares, yes.

1519
01:39:40,827 --> 01:39:48,393
TALIESIN: One, two. Can I get a good view of
Professor Anders and maybe get a little cover from

1520
01:39:48,393 --> 01:39:49,596
the dining room table?

1521
01:39:49,596 --> 01:39:51,087
MATT: You can a little bit, yeah.

1522
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:55,589
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take my cover. I'm going
to pull out--

1523
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:59,711
MATT: As you walk in, around the corner you can
see these armor attacking Grog, his axe forward at

1524
01:39:59,711 --> 01:40:03,151
these two armored entities floating in the air.
You see Anders in the corner, clutching a hand

1525
01:40:03,151 --> 01:40:05,918
over one eye with blood streaking down the face, a
number of wounds bleeding out from the armor.

1526
01:40:05,918 --> 01:40:09,486
Already been a rough day for him, and your eye
slips down, and for the first time in a long time,

1527
01:40:09,486 --> 01:40:16,395
you see on the ground before you, clutching her
throat, no wound or blood splatter but clutching

1528
01:40:16,395 --> 01:40:25,485
her throat and breathing heavily, your sister
Cassandra. And you look back up at Anders and you

1529
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:31,264
feel the burning rage begin to billow up inside
you, and as you walk in the room towards the

1530
01:40:31,264 --> 01:40:36,607
center of the table, you guys who are able to see
the room, you see now, from outside of his

1531
01:40:36,607 --> 01:40:42,549
sleeves, outside from under his coat, there's
blackish purple smoke beginning to (whoosh) billow

1532
01:40:42,549 --> 01:40:43,768
out from behind.

1533
01:40:43,768 --> 01:40:47,326
MARISHA: Does it seem more extreme than it has
been in the past?

1534
01:40:47,326 --> 01:40:50,348
MATT: It seemed pretty extreme in the past. It
just started; you don't know. Go for it.

1535
01:40:50,348 --> 01:40:59,873
TALIESIN: Bonus, I pull off my hat of disguise,
drop it on the floor. And I'm going to just unload

1536
01:40:59,873 --> 01:41:01,287
at that motherfucker.

1537
01:41:01,287 --> 01:41:08,868
MATT: As you pull off the hat, your image shifts
fully to Percy, at which point Anders looks back

1538
01:41:08,868 --> 01:41:14,049
and sees this source of smoke and glances over.
His hand falls away at a moment of realization,

1539
01:41:14,049 --> 01:41:19,199
eye goes wide. "Percy..."

1540
01:41:19,229 --> 01:41:20,527
TALIESIN: Shot one.

1541
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:22,937
MATT: All right.

1542
01:41:22,937 --> 01:41:25,933
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god!

1543
01:41:25,933 --> 01:41:27,651
MARISHA: Oh, when it counts.

1544
01:41:27,651 --> 01:41:30,604
SAM and MARISHA: (ricochet noise)

1545
01:41:30,604 --> 01:41:38,875
MATT: In the frustration, the rage and such, you
pull up your gun and as you go to fire, the bullet

1546
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:44,149
gets caught in the chamber and it almost ejects
the entire barrel from the front of it. It's not

1547
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:46,820
too difficult to repair, but it definitely upsets
the current flow.

1548
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:52,847
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to repair it really
quickly. Trying to remember how to do that because

1549
01:41:52,847 --> 01:41:55,921
I hate it. (mumbling)

1550
01:41:55,921 --> 01:42:03,818
MATT: Is it an action or is it an attack to do?
Should say under the--

1551
01:42:03,818 --> 01:42:07,803
TALIESIN: Action, shit.

1552
01:42:07,803 --> 01:42:10,878
MATT: Yeah, so you have to use your next turn to
try and repair it.

1553
01:42:10,878 --> 01:42:16,922
TALIESIN: (sighs) So I'm just going to sit and
scream a little bit. (shouting)

1554
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:24,635
MATT: Okay, you can see that this whole moment
here, as the smoke pours out from the front of the

1555
01:42:24,635 --> 01:42:30,871
gun, you yell out angrily and there is this
unnatural bassy reverb from your scream that

1556
01:42:30,871 --> 01:42:35,335
shakes the room. Anders actually takes a step back
from this and is looking about the room, and finds

1557
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:39,062
himself basically trapped in the far corner of his
study.

1558
01:42:39,062 --> 01:42:42,216
MARISHA: Oh, you better not!

1559
01:42:42,216 --> 01:42:43,224
MATT: That ends your turn.

1560
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:44,388
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

1561
01:42:44,388 --> 01:42:45,283
MATT: Vax.

1562
01:42:45,283 --> 01:42:57,225
LIAM: I'm going to use disengage, and I'm going to
hop over Cassandra towards Anders and stab him in

1563
01:42:57,225 --> 01:42:58,346
the other eye.

1564
01:42:58,346 --> 01:42:59,401
MATT: Okay.

1565
01:42:59,401 --> 01:43:03,025
LIAM: First attack is 21.

1566
01:43:03,025 --> 01:43:04,380
MATT: That hits.

1567
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,400
LIAM: Second attack is 17.

1568
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,850
MATT: That hits.

1569
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:14,290
LIAM: Okay, ten on the first, ten on the second.

1570
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:19,983
MATT: Okay. Needs to make concentration checks to
see if he can maintain his Dominate. Against ten

1571
01:43:19,983 --> 01:43:24,740
damage? That succeeds, and yeah, that succeeds. So
he maintains concentration of his spell, but both

1572
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,764
daggers, you just run up and stab him. This angry
grunt under your breath with each stab and you can

1573
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:34,222
feel the armor itself is now warm with the pooling
blood from the wounds that you gave him before.

1574
01:43:34,222 --> 01:43:36,025
He's looking pretty rough.

1575
01:43:36,025 --> 01:43:39,478
LIAM: So, question? I asked if I could hit the
eye. Did I hit the eye?

1576
01:43:39,478 --> 01:43:45,500
MATT: Unfortunately, no. It's one of those things
where a Sneak Attack would be an eye shot for this

1577
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:51,731
one. You go and try and stab towards the eye, and
he pulls away; he knows what's coming and uses

1578
01:43:51,731 --> 01:43:57,024
that inertia to jam it into his side and stab a
second time in there. So yeah, no purchase in the

1579
01:43:57,024 --> 01:43:58,018
eye, unfortunately.

1580
01:43:58,018 --> 01:44:00,598
LIAM: Okay. And I'm squared off right in front of
him.

1581
01:44:00,598 --> 01:44:03,671
MATT: Yeah, just right in front of him. That ends
your turn. Grog.

1582
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:06,765
TRAVIS: So when you're dominated, does that mean
charmed?

1583
01:44:06,765 --> 01:44:12,033
MATT: Essentially, you have to follow his orders.
He's not directly, specifically controlling you

1584
01:44:12,033 --> 01:44:17,615
right now, but he told you, "Attack him," so you
have to use all the things at your disposal to now

1585
01:44:17,615 --> 01:44:18,650
attack him.

1586
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:22,269
TRAVIS: Okay. I can't try and break the
domination? Or rage?

1587
01:44:22,269 --> 01:44:24,004
MATT: Nope. You get a saving throw at the end of
your turn.

1588
01:44:24,004 --> 01:44:25,053
TRAVIS: I'm not raging.

1589
01:44:25,053 --> 01:44:25,890
MATT: You're not raging.

1590
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:26,754
TRAVIS: So I only get two.

1591
01:44:26,754 --> 01:44:33,021
MATT: One. You step over Cassandra, (impact noise)
stepping on the back of her leg, and find your way

1592
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:41,610
right there, which is flanking him between Anders,
so you have advantage on both your attacks.

1593
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,557
LAURA: Shit.

1594
01:44:42,557 --> 01:44:44,902
TRAVIS: It's a three.

1595
01:44:44,902 --> 01:44:45,953
LAURA: That's good.

1596
01:44:45,953 --> 01:44:49,933
TRAVIS: 21.

1597
01:44:49,933 --> 01:44:51,042
LIAM: Yeah.

1598
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:52,210
MATT: Second attack.

1599
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:56,031
TRAVIS: 26.

1600
01:44:56,031 --> 01:44:58,343
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1601
01:44:58,343 --> 01:45:01,912
TRAVIS: Really trying not to enjoy this.

1602
01:45:01,912 --> 01:45:04,687
MATT: (laughs) With your flaming war hammer.

1603
01:45:04,687 --> 01:45:10,580
TRAVIS: 18 for the first one.

1604
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:13,227
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage. No, sorry,
bludgeoning damage.

1605
01:45:13,227 --> 01:45:20,556
TRAVIS: Bludgeoning, yeah. And fire. 20, 21.

1606
01:45:20,556 --> 01:45:23,416
MATT: 21 points of bludgeoning and fire damage
with the second strike.

1607
01:45:23,468 --> 01:45:28,994
LIAM: I am on my feet, but I am swaying back and
forth.

1608
01:45:28,994 --> 01:45:32,996
MATT: Unexpectedly, these two titanic slams hit
you from behind. The first one throws you into

1609
01:45:32,996 --> 01:45:38,523
Anders for a second. Anders then pushes you away,
and as you are still reeling from the impact, you

1610
01:45:38,523 --> 01:45:42,773
look up and see the hammer come down, and (whack)
you move your head out in time, preventing you

1611
01:45:42,773 --> 01:45:45,745
from being squished, but the impact hits your
shoulder and the side of your neck, and your whole

1612
01:45:45,745 --> 01:45:50,658
body crumples into itself. You cry out in pain
instinctively, just (screams) from the hit. And

1613
01:45:50,658 --> 01:45:54,938
your whole world blurs for a second as you're
barely keeping yourself on your feet. Grog, that

1614
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:57,668
ends your turn. You can make another saving throw
with advantage to try and shrug the effect.

1615
01:45:57,668 --> 01:46:01,109
TRAVIS: Yeah. Add wisdom right?

1616
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:02,141
MATT: Yes.

1617
01:46:02,141 --> 01:46:05,591
TRAVIS: 19?

1618
01:46:05,591 --> 01:46:12,178
MATT: 19. With that, the momentary controlled
bloodshed fades. Your mind becomes your own, and

1619
01:46:12,178 --> 01:46:17,102
what little bit of remorse you may feel for the
battered Vax in front of you, you can't help but

1620
01:46:17,102 --> 01:46:21,784
laugh a little bit. But then you turn your
attention to the one who bent your will, and your

1621
01:46:21,784 --> 01:46:26,444
rage begins to swell up inside you. So that ends
your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1622
01:46:26,444 --> 01:46:31,060
SAM: I continue my long journey into the room.

1623
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:36,439
MATT: You just get past there, and you can see
into the room. You have visual on, yeah, pretty

1624
01:46:36,439 --> 01:46:37,852
much everything in the room from there.

1625
01:46:37,852 --> 01:46:39,789
SAM: So I have to make a ranged shot if I'm to do
anything.

1626
01:46:39,789 --> 01:46:40,753
MATT: Correct, yeah.

1627
01:46:40,753 --> 01:46:44,570
SAM: What do I see? Can I see how rough Vax is?

1628
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,044
MATT: At a glance, it's hard to tell.

1629
01:46:47,044 --> 01:46:49,883
LIAM: I'm bleeding out my mouth.

1630
01:46:49,883 --> 01:46:51,752
MATT: He's also facing away from you.

1631
01:46:51,752 --> 01:46:53,227
SAM: Looks normal to me.

1632
01:46:53,227 --> 01:46:57,025
MATT: You see Grog and Vax facing off the guy in
the corner. You see two of these large armored

1633
01:46:57,025 --> 01:46:58,102
entities.

1634
01:46:58,102 --> 01:46:59,403
SAM: Okay, I'll go for them.

1635
01:46:59,403 --> 01:47:00,472
MATT: Okay.

1636
01:47:00,472 --> 01:47:06,845
SAM: Wand of Magic Missiles. And I'll shoot three
at the one at the left. That's the first charge,

1637
01:47:06,845 --> 01:47:09,650
and then use three additional charges on the one
on the right.

1638
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:13,245
MATT: Okay. How many charges were restored in the
wand from your last long rest?

1639
01:47:13,245 --> 01:47:20,662
SAM: I roll every day, and I restored five and I
had used five, so it's back to normal. I have

1640
01:47:20,662 --> 01:47:21,815
seven total.

1641
01:47:21,815 --> 01:47:23,614
MATT: So you're casting three on one and then--

1642
01:47:23,614 --> 01:47:25,825
SAM: An additional three on the other.

1643
01:47:25,825 --> 01:47:28,913
MATT: Okay, go for it. So that's 3d4 plus three to
each one. Go for it.

1644
01:47:28,913 --> 01:47:30,751
SAM: Right, 3d4. Okay.

1645
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:34,810
MATT: (magical sound effects) Releasing the wand
on both flicks of your wrist, you can see these

1646
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:37,569
bursts of arcane energy swirl around and slam into
each one of these creatures.

1647
01:47:37,569 --> 01:47:43,360
SAM: 3d4 plus three? Is that right? Is that how it
works, Matt?

1648
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,165
MATT: Yes.

1649
01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:52,981
SAM: Okay, so five (mumbles), eight. Lame. And
(mumbles) nine, no wait. Yes, nine.

1650
01:47:52,981 --> 01:48:01,469
MATT: Okay. All right. (explosion noise) The
impact hits. You see the armor shake for a second and

1651
01:48:01,469 --> 01:48:07,239
look angered and frustrated for what a faceless
arcane entity in armor could, and both heads just

1652
01:48:07,239 --> 01:48:11,616
go (shhhh) and look in your direction simultaneously. That
ends your turn.

1653
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:19,623
SAM: Oh, and I will inspire Grog. (sings) This
is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius. Age of

1654
01:48:19,623 --> 01:48:23,979
a-Grog-ius. A-Grog-ius!

1655
01:48:23,979 --> 01:48:26,227
(laughter)

1656
01:48:26,227 --> 01:48:27,429
TRAVIS: d10?

1657
01:48:27,429 --> 01:48:30,012
MATT: The words are lost on you, but it's a nice
theme. You take a d10, yeah.

1658
01:48:30,012 --> 01:48:31,686
TRAVIS: Not quite my jam, but I'll still take it.

1659
01:48:31,686 --> 01:48:41,077
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Anders,
frustrated by the whole circumstance and on the

1660
01:48:41,077 --> 01:48:49,351
cusp of a really bad circumstance, is going to
attempt to cast Dimension Door.

1661
01:48:49,351 --> 01:48:52,050
MARISHA: I knew it. I knew he was going to do
that.

1662
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,952
LIAM: Do I get an attack? A reaction attack?

1663
01:48:56,952 --> 01:48:59,868
MATT: Not unless you have-- there's a feat that
lets you do that.

1664
01:48:59,868 --> 01:49:00,730
LIAM: No.

1665
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:03,073
MATT: Yeah, I think it's mage slayer.

1666
01:49:03,073 --> 01:49:04,355
LIAM: I don't have that.

1667
01:49:04,355 --> 01:49:05,668
MATT: Okay, all right.

1668
01:49:05,668 --> 01:49:06,851
SAM: Do I see him?

1669
01:49:06,851 --> 01:49:07,975
MATT: Yeah, you see him.

1670
01:49:07,975 --> 01:49:16,663
SAM: I take out my broken shawm and I (piercing
whistle). And I cast Counterspell on him.

1671
01:49:16,663 --> 01:49:18,886
MATT: Right, because you took that when you
leveled up.

1672
01:49:18,886 --> 01:49:20,575
(cheering)

1673
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:28,459
MATT: All right. Oh lord bards. Shit.

1674
01:49:28,459 --> 01:49:30,050
TRAVIS: (laughs) Shit.

1675
01:49:30,092 --> 01:49:31,963
SAM: Wait, I have to tell a level, don't I?

1676
01:49:31,963 --> 01:49:33,394
MATT: Yeah, you can tell me what level.

1677
01:49:33,394 --> 01:49:35,728
SAM: Do I know, because he's a bard, what he's
doing?

1678
01:49:35,728 --> 01:49:38,861
MATT: You are very familiar with the spell. It is
a 4th-level spell.

1679
01:49:38,861 --> 01:49:40,750
SAM: Then I cast it at fourth level.

1680
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:47,738
MATT: Okay. Then there is no roll. With that, he
takes a moment to finish casting. You see there's

1681
01:49:47,738 --> 01:49:52,924
a moment where this bit of purple arcane energy,
familiar to most of you as Scanlan's escapes, begins

1682
01:49:52,924 --> 01:49:58,155
to sparkle behind him and as he goes to step into
it, the shawm shrieks out into the room, he

1683
01:49:58,155 --> 01:50:02,445
(groans) reaches up and covers his eye as it
almost seems to be shrill to his head and cause the

1684
01:50:02,445 --> 01:50:05,943
pain to pulse and the doorway just slams behind
him. (panting)

1685
01:50:05,943 --> 01:50:08,290
SAM: Uh-uh, that door is locked, motherfucker!

1686
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,414
(laughter)

1687
01:50:10,414 --> 01:50:12,212
SAM: Get used to it, because I am!

1688
01:50:12,212 --> 01:50:14,180
(laughter)

1689
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:24,339
MATT: Yeah, that's his turn. That was his action.
He's going to use his bonus action to say, "Come

1690
01:50:24,339 --> 01:50:33,280
"to my aid! Quickly!" He's going to put another
inspiration die to the other armor. And that's

1691
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:41,221
going to end his turn. It's now their turn. They
are both going to come around. This one is just

1692
01:50:41,221 --> 01:50:44,328
going to move around Grog; no attack of
opportunity because it's still in your melee. This

1693
01:50:44,328 --> 01:50:52,768
one is going to step into range from over here.
This one is going to turn and go for Percy. Sees

1694
01:50:52,768 --> 01:50:56,612
this billowing as you're stuck there trying to fix
the gun, and just rushing towards you with its

1695
01:50:56,612 --> 01:51:02,990
shield forward, its horrible, jagged longsword in
the air arcing towards you. Two strikes versus

1696
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:07,101
you. That'll be a 19?

1697
01:51:07,101 --> 01:51:09,775
LIAM: That hits.

1698
01:51:09,775 --> 01:51:18,372
MATT: Okay, first strike, you take nine points of
slashing damage.

1699
01:51:18,372 --> 01:51:19,622
LIAM: I'm down.

1700
01:51:19,622 --> 01:51:24,727
MATT: So you go down. Second strike, because it's
still going for you, hits automatically. It's an

1701
01:51:24,727 --> 01:51:27,891
auto critical. You fail two death saving throws.

1702
01:51:27,891 --> 01:51:28,974
LIAM: That's it?

1703
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:37,883
MATT: That ends its turn. This one is now going
for you, Percy. First strike.

1704
01:51:37,883 --> 01:51:42,034
That would be a nine.

1705
01:51:42,034 --> 01:51:43,069
TALIESIN: No.

1706
01:51:43,069 --> 01:51:47,761
MATT: It's going to use its inspiration die. Add
nine to that, so 18.

1707
01:51:47,761 --> 01:51:49,466
TALIESIN: 18? That's my armor class.

1708
01:51:49,466 --> 01:51:58,824
MATT: (evil laugh) Bards! I'm sorry. I don't get
to use them very often. So that is 11 points of

1709
01:51:58,824 --> 01:52:06,364
slashing damage. And the other strike-- oh, that's
a natural 18, so yeah, that will be... cocked. Oh,

1710
01:52:06,364 --> 01:52:08,421
only eight points of slashing damage.

1711
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:10,145
TALIESIN: So 19 points of slashing damage, total?

1712
01:52:10,145 --> 01:52:16,060
MATT: Correct. (whooshing) And it's painful, but
not a huge thing at this point. You're so focused

1713
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:19,898
right now on the weapon. All right. That ends
their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1714
01:52:19,898 --> 01:52:25,882
MARISHA: Okay, can I see Vax down? Which one
is he on the ground?

1715
01:52:25,882 --> 01:52:30,770
MATT: Vax is right there. You see him get slashed
from behind, fall to the ground, and you see it

1716
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:35,045
raise a blade again and jam it into his torso,
pull it out, and there's a streak of blood that

1717
01:52:35,071 --> 01:52:38,151
just spatters across the ceiling from the force of
the arc.

1718
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:41,304
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think you saw that.

1719
01:52:41,304 --> 01:52:47,389
MARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to move around, tuck
in the door a bit.

1720
01:52:47,389 --> 01:52:50,633
MATT: Okay, so you move in and you see this. As
you rush into the room, you see this arc

1721
01:52:50,633 --> 01:52:51,553
happening.

1722
01:52:51,553 --> 01:52:56,563
MARISHA: Can I tuck right here? God, I'm shaking.
Yeah, right behind that door.

1723
01:52:56,563 --> 01:52:59,352
MATT: Right there, yeah. That'll be pretty much
your movement to get there.

1724
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:06,239
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to duck down, crouch on
the floor. I'm going to cast-- first I'm going

1725
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:12,579
to-- god I'm so nervous-- I'm going to use Healing
Word on Vax, and heal that motherfucker.

1726
01:53:12,579 --> 01:53:14,477
MATT: At what level?

1727
01:53:14,477 --> 01:53:17,863
MARISHA: You're like <i>down</i> down, right?

1728
01:53:17,863 --> 01:53:19,043
LAURA: He's unconscious.

1729
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:23,587
LIAM: And I-- there wasn't even any rolls for
that, right?

1730
01:53:23,587 --> 01:53:24,602
LAURA: No.

1731
01:53:24,602 --> 01:53:29,042
MATT: If you're unconscious and a creature hits
you, you automatically fail a death saving throw

1732
01:53:29,042 --> 01:53:33,024
and if it's a critical hit, which if you're
unconscious a hit is an automatic critical, it's

1733
01:53:33,024 --> 01:53:34,576
technically two death saving throws.

1734
01:53:34,576 --> 01:53:37,184
LIAM: Yeah, and just to understand the whole
breakdown, but where do the three rolls come in?

1735
01:53:37,184 --> 01:53:38,842
LAURA: If nobody hits you--

1736
01:53:38,842 --> 01:53:40,620
LIAM: Oh, if nobody hits, got it.

1737
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:43,443
MATT: Yeah, if nobody hits you and it's your turn,
you roll to see if you-- but if something keeps

1738
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:45,466
hitting you while you're down? Can kill you pretty
quick.

1739
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:46,447
LIAM: Got it.

1740
01:53:46,447 --> 01:53:47,760
MATT: Like two hits.

1741
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,608
MARISHA: But he just hit zero hit points, so
whatever I bring will bring him over, correct?

1742
01:53:51,608 --> 01:53:55,233
MATT: Yeah, and your death saves go away. It's per
turn. Per time you go down.

1743
01:53:55,233 --> 01:54:00,471
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to do a-- I'm sorry,
a level one Healing Word for right now.

1744
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:01,565
MATT: Okay.

1745
01:54:01,565 --> 01:54:10,105
MARISHA: Yes, which gives you 12 hit points. And
then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast

1746
01:54:10,105 --> 01:54:15,484
Grasping Vine, and I'm going to take the vine and
I'm going to wrap it around--

1747
01:54:15,484 --> 01:54:16,515
MATT: Your source?

1748
01:54:16,515 --> 01:54:17,183
MARISHA: Huh?

1749
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:18,335
MATT: Which source?

1750
01:54:18,335 --> 01:54:19,863
MARISHA: Next to me.

1751
01:54:19,863 --> 01:54:21,237
MATT: Okay. So right here?

1752
01:54:21,237 --> 01:54:23,285
MARISHA: I guess, yes.

1753
01:54:23,285 --> 01:54:27,336
MATT: Okay so, out of the wood, a vine-- or it's
not wood, actually. This would be a stone wall. So

1754
01:54:27,336 --> 01:54:31,944
out of a crack in the wall, little bit of material
begins to form into a giant vine that forms next to you.

1755
01:54:31,944 --> 01:54:34,088
What are you doing with it?

1756
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:39,434
MARISHA: I want to wrap it around Cassandra's
feet, her ankle, and I want to

1757
01:54:39,434 --> 01:54:40,667
pull her toward me.

1758
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:44,182
MATT: You pull her over to the side and she gets
pulled across the ground, and she's on her back

1759
01:54:44,182 --> 01:54:49,449
now looking up. Her eyes are a little starry-eyed,
but she's (panting). Looks very confused, and her

1760
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:51,277
eyes are still adjusting to the whole
circumstance.

1761
01:54:51,277 --> 01:54:54,713
MARISHA: And I say, "Hi! Just hang on." And that's
my turn.

1762
01:54:54,713 --> 01:54:56,715
MATT: Yep. All right. Vex, you're up.

1763
01:54:56,715 --> 01:54:59,176
LAURA: Okay. So I saw him go down.

1764
01:54:59,176 --> 01:55:00,375
MATT: Yes.

1765
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:04,655
LAURA: Does it look like he's awake now to me? I'm
mean, it was all happening very quickly.

1766
01:55:04,655 --> 01:55:07,642
MATT: You have no idea. This all happens very
quickly. You just saw your brother take a huge--

1767
01:55:07,642 --> 01:55:09,841
LAURA: I scream and I run towards him.

1768
01:55:09,841 --> 01:55:11,080
MATT: Okay.

1769
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:16,466
LAURA: I slide down on my knees and slide across
the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute--

1770
01:55:16,466 --> 01:55:18,212
or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him.

1771
01:55:18,212 --> 01:55:19,736
MATT: You won't get close enough to do it,
unfortunately.

1772
01:55:19,736 --> 01:55:21,688
LAURA: If I slide down and slide?

1773
01:55:21,688 --> 01:55:28,614
MATT: Make an acrobatics check. For this
circumstance, due to the circumstances with your

1774
01:55:28,614 --> 01:55:30,909
brother being on the ground, I'll let this be a
little more intense.

1775
01:55:30,909 --> 01:55:33,113
SAM: With inspiration.

1776
01:55:33,113 --> 01:55:40,150
LAURA: With inspiration. That is-- wait, hold on.

1777
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:41,481
LIAM: Acrobatics.

1778
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:42,414
LAURA: Acrobatics?

1779
01:55:42,414 --> 01:55:43,234
MATT: Yeah.

1780
01:55:43,234 --> 01:55:45,306
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 17?

1781
01:55:45,306 --> 01:55:50,617
MATT: 17, all right. With that, you rush forward,
just seeing this tunnel vision image of Vax on the

1782
01:55:50,617 --> 01:55:55,241
ground, blood pooling under his form. You dart
forward, slam on your knees and begin preparing

1783
01:55:55,241 --> 01:56:00,385
the spell as you skid across the stone floor of
the study. You reach out and your hands meet his

1784
01:56:00,385 --> 01:56:05,558
form, stopping you in the process just as the surge of
healing energy jolts through his body. So you can

1785
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:07,020
go ahead and cast it on him.

1786
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:22,806
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd
level. So that's 3d8. Where are my d8s? That was

1787
01:56:22,852 --> 01:56:26,580
the worst roll! Nine!

1788
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,345
MATT: So you heal nine hit points.

1789
01:56:28,345 --> 01:56:29,639
LIAM: That's good.

1790
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:31,889
LAURA: That's okay, because I slid to you.

1791
01:56:31,889 --> 01:56:34,486
LIAM: It was amazing. I'll never forget it.

1792
01:56:34,486 --> 01:56:37,738
MATT: (laughs) Okay, that's your turn.

1793
01:56:37,738 --> 01:56:40,080
LAURA: Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her.

1794
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:53,459
MATT: Forward? Okay. That ends your turn. All
right, go ahead and roll an athletics check for

1795
01:56:53,459 --> 01:56:55,955
Trinket.

1796
01:56:55,955 --> 01:57:09,217
LAURA: Right, okay. It's going to count even
though it slipped out of my hand. It's eight.

1797
01:57:09,217 --> 01:57:20,304
MATT: Eight? Okay. Trinket, holding onto the
scruff of Ripley's neck. Ripley then tugs away

1798
01:57:20,304 --> 01:57:26,614
from the grip. Reaches into the pouch she had
earlier. As a bonus action throws down a small

1799
01:57:26,614 --> 01:57:34,263
rock that (explosion noise) fills this entire
tunnel here with a 20 by 20 fog cloud, apparently.

1800
01:57:34,263 --> 01:57:38,475
And now that she's disengaged, she's going
to...

1801
01:57:38,567 --> 01:57:40,377
MARISHA: She smoke-bombed out.

1802
01:57:40,377 --> 01:57:42,095
LAURA: She ain't got no weapons.

1803
01:57:42,095 --> 01:57:49,181
MATT: Nope. Trinket does get an attack of
opportunity on her as she runs past.

1804
01:57:49,181 --> 01:57:51,321
SAM: Yeah, Trinket does. Come on, Trinket.

1805
01:57:51,321 --> 01:58:00,911
LAURA: All right, he's going to bite her. Can he
cannonball her as an attack of opportunity?

1806
01:58:00,911 --> 01:58:02,066
MATT: No, unfortunately.

1807
01:58:02,066 --> 01:58:03,076
LAURA: No? Not so much?

1808
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:04,343
MATT: No, sorry.

1809
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:07,495
LAURA: Nine.

1810
01:58:07,495 --> 01:58:09,282
MATT: Nine. All right

1811
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:12,358
LAURA: Oh wait! Oh, no. I've got to roll for
attack first, huh?

1812
01:58:12,358 --> 01:58:13,682
MATT: Yeah.

1813
01:58:13,682 --> 01:58:19,408
LAURA: That was not what I was doing. So that's
21.

1814
01:58:19,408 --> 01:58:20,505
MATT: That hits, yeah.

1815
01:58:20,505 --> 01:58:21,616
LAURA: Okay, good. That's way better.

1816
01:58:21,616 --> 01:58:22,712
MATT: She has no armor.

1817
01:58:22,712 --> 01:58:28,839
LAURA: Oh, I don't know what I'm doing. What is
going on? I never attack with Trinket. 13.

1818
01:58:28,839 --> 01:58:30,786
MATT: Okay, got it.

1819
01:58:30,786 --> 01:58:32,218
TALIESIN: Cautionary tale in there somewhere.

1820
01:58:32,218 --> 01:58:37,708
MATT: She runs past. The whole area is obscured
for Trinket. Trinket for the moment really has no

1821
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:43,613
idea really where she went as she rushed past, and
bit out and is now giving out this (bear growl)

1822
01:58:43,613 --> 01:58:48,385
notification growl sound, but in the chaos right
now, it's not catching your attention as your

1823
01:58:48,385 --> 01:58:49,718
brother nearly died before you.

1824
01:58:49,718 --> 01:58:50,669
LAURA: Right.

1825
01:58:50,669 --> 01:58:52,703
MATT: All right, that ends her turn. Percy, you're
up.

1826
01:58:52,703 --> 01:58:57,207
TALIESIN: I'm going to break-- first off, I'm
going to fix my gun.

1827
01:58:57,207 --> 01:58:59,635
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make your roll.

1828
01:58:59,713 --> 01:59:14,948
TALIESIN: I'm going to make my roll. Come on. What
do I have to roll? (muttering) I hit the

1829
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:16,926
difficulty. Does that--

1830
01:59:16,926 --> 01:59:23,208
MATT: You hit it, then yeah. With the creature
looming there, you manage to bend it back into

1831
01:59:23,208 --> 01:59:28,633
place. You get it aligned as best as you can.
That's your action, though.

1832
01:59:28,633 --> 01:59:31,819
TALIESIN: If that had been a slightly bigger
fuck-up, that would have been-- oh god! Okay.

1833
01:59:31,819 --> 01:59:33,895
MATT: So your gun's functional, but that's your
action.

1834
01:59:33,895 --> 01:59:37,367
TALIESIN: I'm going to use an action surge anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

1835
01:59:37,367 --> 01:59:38,680
MATT: Yes, you are. Okay.

1836
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:44,513
TALIESIN: I'm going to break off from this guy,
and I'm going to rush towards Professor.

1837
01:59:44,513 --> 01:59:46,808
MATT: Okay, gets an attack of opportunity on you.

1838
01:59:46,808 --> 01:59:48,899
TALIESIN: Go ahead. Don't care.

1839
01:59:48,899 --> 01:59:50,403
MATT: Guy rolls a 14.

1840
01:59:50,403 --> 01:59:51,291
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1841
01:59:51,291 --> 01:59:54,557
MATT: So you just (whoosh) duck under it
instinctually. It comes toward you. Eyes forward,

1842
01:59:54,557 --> 01:59:55,812
you duck underneath the blade.

1843
01:59:55,812 --> 01:59:57,207
TALIESIN: I push him in the face. I don't care.

1844
01:59:57,207 --> 02:00:00,418
MATT: Okay, you get right up to there, and you can
see Anders backing away as you approach.

1845
02:00:00,418 --> 02:00:01,896
TALIESIN: I'm going to unload in him.

1846
02:00:01,896 --> 02:00:03,110
MATT: Go for it.

1847
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:07,676
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.

1848
02:00:07,676 --> 02:00:08,606
MATT: That hits.

1849
02:00:08,606 --> 02:00:12,284
TALIESIN: That's 25 to hit.

1850
02:00:12,284 --> 02:00:13,613
MATT: That hits.

1851
02:00:13,613 --> 02:00:16,287
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

1852
02:00:16,287 --> 02:00:18,007
MARISHA: There is Percy!

1853
02:00:18,007 --> 02:00:19,682
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

1854
02:00:19,682 --> 02:00:21,510
MATT: Anti-Wheaton.

1855
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:29,462
TALIESIN: Okay, let's see, that's 11.

1856
02:00:29,462 --> 02:00:30,583
MATT: Okay.

1857
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:34,005
TALIESIN: 14.

1858
02:00:34,005 --> 02:00:40,008
MATT: All righty. This is the critical.

1859
02:00:40,008 --> 02:00:49,118
TALIESIN: Yep, this is the critical which is
seven, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 with fire damage.

1860
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:51,674
MATT: Okay. How do you want to do this?

1861
02:00:51,674 --> 02:00:53,530
(cheering)

1862
02:00:53,530 --> 02:01:00,588
TALIESIN: How close to him do I get? And this was
without smoke damage, I might add.

1863
02:01:00,588 --> 02:01:04,085
MATT: You can get one more step up there. You can
take the shots as you're stepping towards him,

1864
02:01:04,085 --> 02:01:05,081
unloading.

1865
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:06,532
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm unloading as I walk towards
him.

1866
02:01:06,532 --> 02:01:11,017
MATT: So the first one (gunshot) blasts out the
shoulder. You can see the bone exposed, the metal

1867
02:01:11,017 --> 02:01:21,703
breastplate sundered by the bullet, as he backs up
(gasping) As you're walking towards him, he begins

1868
02:01:21,703 --> 02:01:28,184
shouting, "Percival, you disappoint us all. All
you had to do was die like a good de Rolo."

1869
02:01:28,184 --> 02:01:32,595
TALIESIN: Traitor! And I've got two more shots.
Next shot.

1870
02:01:32,595 --> 02:01:38,081
MATT: This one (gunshot) into his chest, and you
can see the actual breastplate bends inward to the

1871
02:01:38,081 --> 02:01:43,776
wound and he's (choking noise) spitting out blood
from his mouth as he bends forward. "This land has

1872
02:01:43,776 --> 02:01:51,526
"a greater destiny. You and that fool Ripley, you
place your faith in toys and dust. You seek the

1873
02:01:51,526 --> 02:01:52,956
"transient truths."

1874
02:01:52,956 --> 02:01:57,019
TALIESIN: How close am I to him at this point?

1875
02:01:57,019 --> 02:01:58,417
MATT: You're stepping up to him.

1876
02:01:58,417 --> 02:01:59,480
TALIESIN: Perfect.

1877
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:04,674
MATT: And as you're doing this, as you're pull the
mask down, he says, "I die to rise again. We are

1878
02:02:04,674 --> 02:02:05,912
"his blood."

1879
02:02:05,912 --> 02:02:12,016
TALIESIN: I put my gun in his mouth to shut him
the fuck up. "You're the face I saw when murder

1880
02:02:12,016 --> 02:02:16,306
"entered my heart. This is your doing." And I pull
the trigger.

1881
02:02:16,306 --> 02:02:22,546
MATT: With that, a resounding blast (explosion
noise) echoes through the room. The back of his

1882
02:02:22,546 --> 02:02:28,973
head just scatters across the wall behind him. The
top of his head folds in a little bit from the

1883
02:02:28,973 --> 02:02:36,012
lack of a substantial base, and he tumbles
backwards, releasing the gun with a limp (splat)

1884
02:02:36,012 --> 02:02:42,026
onto the ground behind. You're still holding the
Pepperbox in front of you, hands shaking. As you

1885
02:02:42,026 --> 02:02:45,551
hold it there, looking at it, you can see there's
a flash of purple energy across the barrel that

1886
02:02:45,551 --> 02:02:50,022
has Anders's name across it and (fluttering noise)
the name burns away, leaving the barrel blank.

1887
02:02:50,022 --> 02:02:53,845
TALIESIN: (heavy breathing)

1888
02:02:53,845 --> 02:02:59,243
MATT: Smoke begins to subside a little bit. It's
still there, but it seems like at the moment, it

1889
02:02:59,243 --> 02:03:00,810
has this release aspect to it.

1890
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:02,277
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

1891
02:03:02,277 --> 02:03:04,984
MATT: Yeah, that is your turn. Vax you're up.

1892
02:03:04,984 --> 02:03:09,759
LIAM: How close are the suits of armor to me? I
can't tell.

1893
02:03:09,759 --> 02:03:15,469
MATT: There's one over here, and there's one--
technically it's right next to you.

1894
02:03:15,469 --> 02:03:17,312
LIAM: Right next to me? And am I still prone?

1895
02:03:17,312 --> 02:03:18,376
MATT: You're still prone.

1896
02:03:18,376 --> 02:03:19,618
LIAM: So how much movement does it take to--

1897
02:03:19,618 --> 02:03:20,634
MATT: Half your movement.

1898
02:03:20,634 --> 02:03:21,802
LIAM: Half my movement.

1899
02:03:21,802 --> 02:03:23,468
SAM: Don't give him an attack of opportunity.

1900
02:03:23,468 --> 02:03:26,382
LIAM: No, I'm going to get up, and I'm going to
use disengage.

1901
02:03:26,382 --> 02:03:28,007
MATT: As a bonus action, okay.

1902
02:03:28,007 --> 02:03:32,594
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going to skip back into the
corner, and at this point I can throw one dagger

1903
02:03:32,594 --> 02:03:35,036
at that suit of armor, so I'm going to do that.

1904
02:03:35,036 --> 02:03:36,077
MATT: Yes, you can.

1905
02:03:36,077 --> 02:03:39,042
LIAM: That is 19.

1906
02:03:39,042 --> 02:03:40,163
MATT: That hits.

1907
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:44,720
LIAM: I have no voice left. That is an 11.

1908
02:03:44,720 --> 02:04:07,381
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty. Great,
okay. Let's see here now. That ends your turn. I

1909
02:04:07,381 --> 02:04:09,585
had the list down here. All right. Grog, you're
up.

1910
02:04:09,585 --> 02:04:12,253
TRAVIS: Am I flanked by two suits of armor or just
one?

1911
02:04:12,253 --> 02:04:13,405
MATT: Nope, there's just one right next to you.

1912
02:04:13,405 --> 02:04:15,409
TRAVIS: I'll turn to him and rage.

1913
02:04:15,409 --> 02:04:16,782
MATT: Okay. Regular rage.

1914
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,826
TRAVIS: Regular rage, and swing away.

1915
02:04:18,826 --> 02:04:20,517
LIAM: Classic rage, we call it.

1916
02:04:20,517 --> 02:04:21,511
TRAVIS: Classic rage.

1917
02:04:21,511 --> 02:04:22,765
LAURA: Good old classic rage.

1918
02:04:22,765 --> 02:04:24,950
TRAVIS: 14?

1919
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:26,256
MATT: 14 hits.

1920
02:04:26,256 --> 02:04:29,252
TRAVIS: Nice. And 25.

1921
02:04:29,252 --> 02:04:30,817
MATT: Both hit, yeah.

1922
02:04:30,817 --> 02:04:31,719
LAURA: You get three hits.

1923
02:04:31,719 --> 02:04:32,719
TRAVIS: Nah, just two.

1924
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:33,715
LAURA: I thought rage-- oh.

1925
02:04:33,715 --> 02:04:45,785
TRAVIS: Believe me, I know. 17 with the fire
damage. First one.

1926
02:04:45,785 --> 02:04:47,262
MATT: Okay.

1927
02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:52,486
TRAVIS: 18 on the second one.

1928
02:04:52,486 --> 02:05:00,460
MATT: Okay, cool. So as you slam your hammer twice
into it, the armor dents. You can see now, the

1929
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:05,005
energy that's holding it together is flickering,
almost like the arcane entity that resides within

1930
02:05:05,005 --> 02:05:09,945
it is having a hard time keeping itself in
physical form. All right. That end your turn,

1931
02:05:09,945 --> 02:05:11,483
unless you want to move or do anything else.

1932
02:05:11,483 --> 02:05:12,438
TRAVIS: Nope.

1933
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:13,563
SAM: Did you hit?

1934
02:05:13,563 --> 02:05:14,503
MATT: Scanlan. You're up.

1935
02:05:14,503 --> 02:05:15,409
TRAVIS: Yeah, twice.

1936
02:05:15,409 --> 02:05:18,475
SAM: Okay. Oh, me? Oh man, I can't do anything
against these fuckers.

1937
02:05:18,475 --> 02:05:20,874
MARISHA: Yes, you can.

1938
02:05:20,874 --> 02:05:22,244
LIAM: You're Scanlan Shorthalt.

1939
02:05:22,244 --> 02:05:23,854
MARISHA: Believe!

1940
02:05:23,854 --> 02:05:31,454
SAM: All right. I'll enter the room, I suppose.
Just a little. Right there.

1941
02:05:31,454 --> 02:05:32,806
MARISHA: Just the tip.

1942
02:05:32,806 --> 02:05:42,111
SAM: Just the tip, and shit. I don't want to waste
anything on these fuckers. Okay, let's see here.

1943
02:05:42,111 --> 02:05:49,486
I'll just do-- 2d8. All right, I'll run up.
Actually, a little bit closer to the guy closest

1944
02:05:49,486 --> 02:05:51,623
to me.

1945
02:05:51,623 --> 02:05:53,124
MATT: Okay. You'll get into melee with him if you
do.

1946
02:05:53,124 --> 02:05:56,004
SAM: What does that mean?

1947
02:05:56,004 --> 02:05:59,253
MATT: Means if you want to do any ranged attack or
spell attack roll, you would have disadvantage on

1948
02:05:59,253 --> 02:06:00,692
it, but otherwise it has no effect.

1949
02:06:00,692 --> 02:06:03,139
LAURA: He can attack you, though, because he's
right next to you.

1950
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:04,354
SAM: He won't be for long.

1951
02:06:04,354 --> 02:06:05,678
MATT: Okay.

1952
02:06:05,678 --> 02:06:10,130
SAM: So I get up close in, like five feet away,
and then I'll just Thunderwave him.

1953
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:11,349
MATT: Okay.

1954
02:06:11,349 --> 02:06:15,208
SAM: I do that thing where frat boys do the chest
bump.

1955
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:16,917
MARISHA: Like, "Come at me, bro?"

1956
02:06:16,917 --> 02:06:18,813
SAM: Yeah. (grunts)

1957
02:06:18,813 --> 02:06:21,306
MARISHA: That's awesome.

1958
02:06:21,353 --> 02:06:23,426
TRAVIS: (quietly) We did do that.

1959
02:06:23,467 --> 02:06:25,228
MATT: All righty.

1960
02:06:25,255 --> 02:06:29,901
SAM: That's just like 2d8.

1961
02:06:29,901 --> 02:06:31,232
MATT: Yeah, okay.

1962
02:06:31,232 --> 02:06:32,902
LIAM: Roll two d8s.

1963
02:06:32,902 --> 02:06:34,598
MATT: Is this the 1st-level Thunderwave?

1964
02:06:34,598 --> 02:06:36,487
SAM: I believe it is, yes.

1965
02:06:36,487 --> 02:06:43,072
MATT: Okay, so makes a constitution saving throw.
No, he rolled a natural four, so it takes 2d8

1966
02:06:43,072 --> 02:06:49,479
thunder damage and he is pushed over the table,
and then would fall over if it wasn't now drifting

1967
02:06:49,479 --> 02:06:53,949
above the ground a few inches. Rights itself, but
it did push it away from you. Roll 2d8 damage.

1968
02:06:53,949 --> 02:06:56,149
SAM: I did. It's only nine points of damage.

1969
02:06:56,149 --> 02:07:02,213
MATT: Nine points of thunder damage against that
helmed creature. All right, that brings us to

1970
02:07:02,213 --> 02:07:08,155
their turn. This creature you just slammed into is
going to rush back towards you. This one's going

1971
02:07:08,155 --> 02:07:13,881
to turn and attack you, Grog. Two strikes against
you. That is a 15.

1972
02:07:13,881 --> 02:07:15,038
TRAVIS: Misses.

1973
02:07:15,038 --> 02:07:16,694
MATT: Sorry. 25. Rolled an 18 naturally.

1974
02:07:16,694 --> 02:07:17,586
TRAVIS: Hits.

1975
02:07:17,586 --> 02:07:18,504
MATT: And that is a 21.

1976
02:07:18,504 --> 02:07:19,288
TRAVIS: Both hit.

1977
02:07:19,288 --> 02:07:26,239
MATT: Okay, so you take six points of slashing
damage, halved to three, and nine points slashing

1978
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:31,379
damage, halved to five. So eight points of
slashing damage total. Two strikes against you,

1979
02:07:31,379 --> 02:07:33,816
Scanlan. That is an 18.

1980
02:07:33,816 --> 02:07:35,150
SAM: Oh, yes. That hits.

1981
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:37,468
MATT: Okay, and then a 12.

1982
02:07:37,468 --> 02:07:38,957
SAM: Hey, that misses!

1983
02:07:38,957 --> 02:07:46,977
MATT: So you take-- that's seven plus 11 points of
slashing damage. (whoosh) As it goes to strike a

1984
02:07:46,977 --> 02:07:53,051
second time, you see the second blow coming and
just duck out of the way. That ends their go. Next

1985
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:54,590
up is Keyleth.

1986
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:56,250
MARISHA: So there are two guys alive right now?

1987
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:57,219
MATT: Correct, yes.

1988
02:07:57,219 --> 02:07:58,730
MARISHA: One's on Scanlan.

1989
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:03,102
MATT: One's on Grog. The one on Grog is looking a
little rough. The one near Scanlan's doing okay.

1990
02:08:03,102 --> 02:08:05,827
MARISHA: How's Cassandra looking next to me?

1991
02:08:05,827 --> 02:08:11,340
MATT: She's fine. There's no blood. There's
nothing; the wound is gone entirely. But other

1992
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,779
than that, she looks fine.

1993
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:19,921
MARISHA: Looks fine. Okay, I've got my Grasping
Vine still up. I'm going to wrap it around the guy

1994
02:08:19,921 --> 02:08:23,691
that's close to Scanlan and just yank him off of
Scanlan.

1995
02:08:23,691 --> 02:08:31,148
MATT: Okay. This pulls him over Scanlan's form and
slams him right next to Cassandra.

1996
02:08:31,148 --> 02:08:43,017
MARISHA: Okay, and then I will just go, oh! And
pop him with my staff.

1997
02:08:43,017 --> 02:08:44,039
MATT: Go for it.

1998
02:08:44,039 --> 02:08:45,360
SAM: You can hit things?

1999
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:52,231
MARISHA: Yeah, I got a big old staff, yo! I'm not
great at it, but I can do it. Oh, that's not bad.

2000
02:08:52,231 --> 02:08:53,333
16.

2001
02:08:53,333 --> 02:08:55,230
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.

2002
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:56,920
MARISHA: Aw. (ping)

2003
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,450
SAM: He's got armor.

2004
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:00,322
MARISHA: It sounded nice, though.

2005
02:09:00,322 --> 02:09:01,249
SAM: It did.

2006
02:09:01,249 --> 02:09:02,812
MARISHA: Kind of resonated a little.

2007
02:09:02,812 --> 02:09:08,482
MATT: Shakes off of it for a second. All right, so
that ends your turn?

2008
02:09:08,482 --> 02:09:09,450
MARISHA: Yep.

2009
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:10,810
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Vex.

2010
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,151
LAURA: So I'm still down on my knees.

2011
02:09:12,151 --> 02:09:14,509
MATT: You're still down on your knees. Your
brother got up and rushed off, he seems okay,

2012
02:09:14,509 --> 02:09:16,697
(panting) taking a breath for himself.

2013
02:09:16,743 --> 02:09:22,369
LAURA: I look up at Percy who is covered in smoke,
and I grab his hand and I say,

2014
02:09:22,369 --> 02:09:25,910
"Percival, how are you?"

2015
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:29,735
MATT: His head slowly turns towards you, the mask
still on. You can see his eyes just barely through

2016
02:09:29,735 --> 02:09:33,805
the glistening circular glass slots where he looks
through. The smoke still billowing up from

2017
02:09:33,805 --> 02:09:36,803
underneath, the head slowly turns towards you.

2018
02:09:36,803 --> 02:09:37,977
TALIESIN: Fine.

2019
02:09:37,977 --> 02:09:40,763
LAURA: "Darling, take the mask off," and I--

2020
02:09:40,763 --> 02:09:42,477
TALIESIN: I don't have a turn yet.

2021
02:09:42,477 --> 02:09:43,539
MATT: No.

2022
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:46,840
LAURA: And I shoot at the guy that's attacking
Grog.

2023
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:52,616
MATT: Okay. He is technically in melee with you,
so you get disadvantage on these strikes unless

2024
02:09:52,616 --> 02:09:54,304
you want to move away.

2025
02:09:54,304 --> 02:09:58,215
LAURA: Does he get an attack of opportunity,
though, if I scooch back?

2026
02:09:58,215 --> 02:10:01,450
MATT: He would, unless-- he didn't take one
against you when you ran back because you

2027
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:02,740
disengaged, so yes, he would.

2028
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:04,020
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

2029
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:09,139
MATT: Okay, so you move back a step. That is a
21.

2030
02:10:09,139 --> 02:10:10,519
LAURA: Hits.

2031
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:14,822
MATT: Okay, you take nine points of slashing
damage as you reach back. The creature (whoosh)

2032
02:10:14,822 --> 02:10:16,868
arcs with its sword and manages to strike you.

2033
02:10:16,868 --> 02:10:17,871
LAURA: Bastard!

2034
02:10:17,871 --> 02:10:19,299
MATT: Roll for your attacks.

2035
02:10:19,299 --> 02:10:27,050
LAURA: Okay, that is a 26 and a 23.

2036
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:30,918
MATT: Both hit.

2037
02:10:30,918 --> 02:10:41,456
LAURA: I didn't Hunter's Mark him, because I'm
brilliant. Yes! 15, 30, 34 points.

2038
02:10:41,456 --> 02:10:43,745
MATT: 34 points of damage for both?

2039
02:10:43,745 --> 02:10:49,067
LAURA: Yeah, two eights. Plus 14. Plus my
bracers.

2040
02:10:49,067 --> 02:10:54,428
MATT: Right. You pull the arrows out and launch
them both simultaneously, two arrows in one notch;

2041
02:10:54,428 --> 02:10:58,683
release them both. One slams into the armor. That
one goes underneath the helmet, and as it strikes

2042
02:10:58,683 --> 02:11:04,038
you hear this horrible echoing (screeching)
screech that echoes as the armor (thud) falls to

2043
02:11:04,038 --> 02:11:04,903
the ground.

2044
02:11:04,903 --> 02:11:05,964
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2045
02:11:05,964 --> 02:11:09,776
MATT: You can take the rest of your movement, if
you like.

2046
02:11:09,776 --> 02:11:12,431
LAURA: I stand up.

2047
02:11:12,431 --> 02:11:15,316
MATT: Well, you were standing up to move back.

2048
02:11:15,316 --> 02:11:16,320
LAURA: I scooched back, right?

2049
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:17,965
MATT: Unless you wanted to be like--

2050
02:11:17,965 --> 02:11:19,457
LAURA: Yeah I wanted to be like--

2051
02:11:19,457 --> 02:11:21,311
MATT: Okay, so you pulled back while on the
ground. Release the arrows.

2052
02:11:21,311 --> 02:11:22,625
LAURA: Yeah, like up into them.

2053
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:27,281
MATT: There you go. All right. Stand up, brush
yourself off. That ends your go.

2054
02:11:27,281 --> 02:11:30,429
LAURA: And Trinket isn't allowed to move any at
all?

2055
02:11:30,429 --> 02:11:31,877
MATT: Trinket can, if you want.

2056
02:11:31,877 --> 02:11:33,028
LAURA: Can he run after her?

2057
02:11:33,028 --> 02:11:39,707
MATT: Yep. Rushes out. Will get there. Rushes
through the fog and looks over and sees her right

2058
02:11:39,707 --> 02:11:49,284
there. Okay. That ends your turn, and now it's her
turn. She goes into a full dash and takes off.

2059
02:11:49,284 --> 02:11:50,964
TALIESIN: Does Trinket get an attack of
opportunity for that?

2060
02:11:50,964 --> 02:11:52,633
MATT: Trinket does get attack of opportunity.

2061
02:11:52,633 --> 02:11:53,486
LAURA: Okay.

2062
02:11:53,486 --> 02:11:54,487
MARISHA: Come on, Trinket.

2063
02:11:54,487 --> 02:11:55,440
TRAVIS: Scratch her up.

2064
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:56,722
LAURA: That's in the corner. I can't really say.

2065
02:11:56,722 --> 02:12:00,588
TRAVIS: Oh, you piece of shit

2066
02:12:00,588 --> 02:12:01,692
LIAM: (clicks his teeth together)

2067
02:12:01,692 --> 02:12:03,139
LAURA: Don't do that. I hate that sound.

2068
02:12:03,139 --> 02:12:05,021
(laughter)

2069
02:12:05,021 --> 02:12:06,033
MATT: So what did you roll?

2070
02:12:06,033 --> 02:12:07,868
LAURA: That's a 12.

2071
02:12:07,868 --> 02:12:09,062
LIAM: Good to know.

2072
02:12:09,351 --> 02:12:10,367
MATT: 12?

2073
02:12:10,367 --> 02:12:11,286
LAURA: Yeah.

2074
02:12:11,286 --> 02:12:12,380
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately.

2075
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,187
LAURA: No, it doesn't.

2076
02:12:13,187 --> 02:12:16,524
MATT: Even with no armor, she's a pretty quick
one. She ducks below and bolts down the hallway

2077
02:12:16,524 --> 02:12:17,758
and around the corner.

2078
02:12:17,758 --> 02:12:19,797
TRAVIS: Why did we let her have anything?

2079
02:12:19,797 --> 02:12:20,726
MATT: All right.

2080
02:12:20,726 --> 02:12:21,769
LAURA: You're out.

2081
02:12:21,769 --> 02:12:25,228
MATT: So that ends your turn, her turn. Percy,
you're up.

2082
02:12:25,228 --> 02:12:39,717
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull off the mask and walk
forward a bit, about there, and take three shots

2083
02:12:39,717 --> 02:12:41,255
at the armor.

2084
02:12:41,255 --> 02:12:42,344
MATT: Okay, regular shots?

2085
02:12:42,344 --> 02:12:43,640
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shots.

2086
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,571
MATT: Okay.

2087
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:49,950
TALIESIN: With one ice, so 14.

2088
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:53,120
MATT: 14 misses. Deflects it with the shield.

2089
02:12:53,120 --> 02:13:00,221
TALIESIN: Make sure I'm doing this right. Yeah.
Goddamn it. 17.

2090
02:13:00,221 --> 02:13:02,259
MATT: Deflects the second one with the shield.

2091
02:13:02,259 --> 02:13:03,338
LAURA: Damn it!

2092
02:13:03,338 --> 02:13:04,696
MATT: Heavy armor on this one.

2093
02:13:04,696 --> 02:13:06,601
TALIESIN: Dropping sharpshooter for the third
one.

2094
02:13:06,601 --> 02:13:09,151
MATT: Okay.

2095
02:13:09,151 --> 02:13:13,104
TALIESIN: Not that it helped. 16.

2096
02:13:13,104 --> 02:13:17,565
MATT: This one actually manages to duck out of the
way and splinters across the wall behind it.

2097
02:13:17,565 --> 02:13:20,309
SAM: They're tough.

2098
02:13:20,309 --> 02:13:22,170
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

2099
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:23,551
MATT: All righty. Vax, you're up.

2100
02:13:23,551 --> 02:13:24,585
MARISHA: Kill them.

2101
02:13:24,585 --> 02:13:29,594
LIAM: I'm just going to walk as far as I can, so
30 feet.

2102
02:13:29,594 --> 02:13:31,419
MATT: There.

2103
02:13:31,419 --> 02:13:33,720
LIAM: Am I within 40 feet?

2104
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:36,651
MATT: No.

2105
02:13:36,651 --> 02:13:38,545
LIAM: Then I just stand.

2106
02:13:38,545 --> 02:13:40,987
MATT: Well, you can use the rest of your action to
keep moving, if you'd like.

2107
02:13:40,987 --> 02:13:46,141
LIAM: All right, yeah. I'm going to move around
that table and get by Scanlan.

2108
02:13:46,141 --> 02:13:47,534
Stand right next to him.

2109
02:13:47,534 --> 02:13:49,990
MATT: Okay, that brings us to Grog.

2110
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:52,349
TRAVIS: I would like to move to the suit of armor
please.

2111
02:13:52,349 --> 02:14:00,116
MATT: Run towards it, jumping and putting one foot
on the table; using that as momentum to rush in

2112
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:03,129
the air. Go ahead and roll
your attack.

2113
02:14:03,129 --> 02:14:05,217
TRAVIS: 24?

2114
02:14:05,217 --> 02:14:06,992
MATT: 24 hits.

2115
02:14:06,992 --> 02:14:08,284
TRAVIS: And 25.

2116
02:14:08,284 --> 02:14:09,762
MATT: That hits.

2117
02:14:09,762 --> 02:14:15,388
TRAVIS: 20 with fire damage.

2118
02:14:15,388 --> 02:14:16,542
MATT: Nice.

2119
02:14:16,542 --> 02:14:21,658
TRAVIS: And 16 with fire damage.

2120
02:14:21,658 --> 02:14:27,066
MATT: Gotcha. (grunts) Bringing the hammer down,
the helmet actually gets pushed into the armor and

2121
02:14:27,066 --> 02:14:30,239
has to reform itself. Before it has a chance to,
you bring around the hammer and hit the shield

2122
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:34,416
with such force that it pushes it into itself and
slams it against the wall. You take the back of

2123
02:14:34,416 --> 02:14:39,775
the hammer and slam it up under the actual helmet,
hitting the creature. You see the flames burn

2124
02:14:39,775 --> 02:14:43,584
across the side of its arcane form, causing it to
shimmer for a second. It's looking pretty rough.
