1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:03,155
MATT: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:06,610
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,880
(cheering)

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,565
MATT: Indeed. Tonight, we are sadly down one Sam
Riegel, because apparently he has priorities.

5
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,323
LAURA: Where is he?

6
00:00:14,323 --> 00:00:15,494
MATT: I actually don't know.

7
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,211
LIAM: Watching his kids!

8
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,707
LAURA: Is that where he's at?

9
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:19,774
LIAM: I don't know where he is.

10
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:20,632
LAURA: I don't know where he is.

11
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:21,590
MATT: That's weird. Well--

12
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,722
MARISHA: Oh, man, I feel like he told us.

13
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,683
(laughter)

14
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:24,709
MARISHA: You know? I just don't remember where he
is--

15
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,700
LAURA: What is his mother's name!?

16
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,855
MARISHA: What is his mother's name!?

17
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,498
LAURA: It's Lenore! I know it. It's Scanlan's
mom--

18
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:30,707
MARISHA: You don't care about his past!

19
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,115
TALIESIN: What am I doing Thursday night!?

20
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,591
(laughter)

21
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,103
TRAVIS: It's not that we don't remember, we just
don't care.

22
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,340
TALIESIN: (laughs) Yeah.

23
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,734
MATT: Well, Sam, wherever you are, you're not
watching, so you'll never hear this anyway.

24
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:42,646
(laughter)

25
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,164
MATT: But we love you.

26
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,703
TRAVIS: It's true. That's hilarious because it's
true.

27
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:51,635
MATT: Before we get into tonight's episode, let's
get through a few announcements here. First and

28
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:56,218
foremost, tonight we have the delight of being
sponsored by our returning friends Puzzle Quest!

29
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,024
(cheering)

30
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:03,040
MATT: Puzzle Quest, they're not pushing anything
in particular, but we're wanting to talk about a

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,468
bit how they're just-- their Marvel Puzzle Quest
is awesome. I've been playing Puzzle Quest since

32
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:12,032
it first came out. I remember spending many angry
hours on Xbox Live, getting my ass kicked by

33
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:15,264
people in Puzzle Quest when it first came there.
But Taliesin, did you have anything

34
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,314
you wanted to say?

35
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:17,186
TRAVIS: It's a big anniversary for them.

36
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,951
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's Puzzle Quest's ten-year
anniversary.

37
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,905
LAURA: Wow, really?

38
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:28,667
TALIESIN: Yeah, and gosh, golly. Puzzle Quest.
Marvel. Marvel Puzzle Quest.

39
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:32,076
Marvel and Puzzle Quest.

40
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:32,980
MARISHA: You're not Sam Riegel.

41
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,781
TALIESIN: I'm not Sam Riegel!

42
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:34,617
MARISHA: You're not Sam Riegel.

43
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:38,422
TALIESIN: I'm doing my best! I was just given
this! I thought he was going to be here! We

44
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:42,787
brought his things out. I thought he was going to
be here! And now I have this,

45
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:44,198
and I have to somehow--

46
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,216
TRAVIS: Can you just play on his harmonica, or
something?

47
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,663
TALIESIN: I'm not touching that. I know where it's
been.

48
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:52,062
LIAM: It's a hard truth that only one of us is
irreplaceable.

49
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,024
TALIESIN: That's so true.

50
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:53,843
MATT: This is true.

51
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:54,782
LAURA: It's sad.

52
00:01:54,782 --> 00:02:01,897
TALIESIN: I can say that I do love comic books. I
love three-jewel replacement games that I can play

53
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,089
on airplanes--

54
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,039
LIAM: And Marvel.

55
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,197
TALIESIN: -- and when I wanna pretend to listen to
my family over Christmas. It's great.

56
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:08,315
MARISHA: You're killing it, man.

57
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:10,789
TALIESIN: I know, and I suddenly realised a couple
of them watch the show, and now they know that I'm

58
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,048
not really texting you guys.

59
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:15,119
LIAM: Taliesin pulls out a curly blonde wig and--

60
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,271
MATT: And starts jamming candy bars in his mouth.

61
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,657
LAURA: Shaka, man, oh yeah.

62
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:19,730
(laughter)

63
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,606
TALIESIN: But, Marvel Puzzle Quest is great,
because it's all the fun of the three-gem,

64
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:27,613
Bejeweled-style games, but you would also collect
characters if you're a big nerd like I am, and

65
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:33,604
they've got basics like Thor and Iron Man, and new
fun ones, like Ms. Marvel, and--

66
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,903
LAURA: What about Black Widow? Do they have Black
Widow?

67
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:35,780
TALIESIN: They have Black Widow.

68
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,515
LAURA: Hell yeah, they do.

69
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,646
TALIESIN: Black Widow is actually one of the first
ones I ever got, but they've also got crazy ones--

70
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,443
they've got Devil Dinosaur. That's nuts.

71
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:42,123
MATT: That's pretty intense, actually.

72
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,064
MARISHA: It's pretty nuts.

73
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,659
MATT: Do they have Slapstick?

74
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:52,059
TALIESIN: I'm even more embarrassed that I know
you now. It was already bad. This is why you're

75
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,906
never going to be on my show, Matt.

76
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,567
MATT: (cries) I know.

77
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,038
TALIESIN: Ooh. You're never going to be on my show
because you don't have time. I know.

78
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:00,334
(laughter)

79
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,557
MATT: That's exactly why.

80
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,264
TALIESIN: But yeah. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Thank you
guys. You can get it on Steam, Amazon App Store,

81
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,702
Google Play, Apple Store-- it's all over the
place.

82
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:11,334
LAURA: Yay, thanks, Marvel Puzzle Quest!

83
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,639
LIAM: Next up!

84
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,870
MATT: We have any merch updates? Or are we just
still kicking ass in the store?

85
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,042
LAURA: (high-pitched) Hey, there's stuff in the
store, you guys! You should go look in the store

86
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,538
and see what is there.

87
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,537
MATT: Perfect. Thank you, Laura.

88
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,661
LAURA: You're welcome.

89
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:29,453
MATT: That was adorable. We have Wondercon coming
up! Which we're excited about. It's for you guys

90
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:34,139
who are able to come to Wondercon, Anaheim,
California, April 1st on Saturday, we're having

91
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,841
our Talks Machina live panel from 2-3PM in the
Arena, the big room there, and--

92
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,624
TRAVIS: Come to Anaheim, 4,000 seats!

93
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,723
MARISHA: Yeah, big seats!

94
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,592
MATT: Trying to fill the room.

95
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,700
TALIESIN: Comfy seats.

96
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,438
MATT: Because if we manage to fill the room, we
can use that as an example as to why we have good

97
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,152
crowds, and we can hopefully do more events in
more places in the country, or around the world!

98
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:53,412
And see you guys in person.

99
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:59,478
TRAVIS: We want to see everyone within a
reasonable driving or flying distance.

100
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:03,626
LIAM: Also, Taliesin and I are going to fistfight
until one of us is dead or unconscious.

101
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,137
MARISHA: I'm going to break a pool cue.

102
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:06,046
TALIESIN: While drunk.

103
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,964
MATT: That's new. I didn't--

104
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:07,921
LAURA: It's going to be epic.

105
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:08,954
MATT: Okay! So that's a thing.

106
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:10,319
TRAVIS: Just roll with it.

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,444
MATT: See that-- yeah.

108
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,139
LIAM: Got a lot of pent-up aggression, Tal.

109
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,033
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

110
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,553
MATT: Perfect.

111
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,186
TALIESIN: I want a bruise, right here.

112
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:19,079
MATT: April 1st.

113
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,415
MARISHA: (laughs) I want a bruise.

114
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:24,490
MATT: 2PM at Wondercon, our panel, and--

115
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:28,063
TALIESIN: Critical Brawl. We just barefist it.

116
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:28,893
MARISHA: Man.

117
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,393
MATT: Speaking of Taliesin unconscious-- Wednesday
Club!

118
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,677
TALIESIN: Oh, god! That's right.

119
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,190
TRAVIS: (laughs) Great one.

120
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,868
TALIESIN: We had a great time this week talking
about Swamp Thing and horror comics. Next week,

121
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:46,494
we're going to be talking vaguely about DC Comics;
everything from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,

122
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:51,877
Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, the whole set of
them and all the weirdness, and talking about

123
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:56,620
52, what it is, why people seemed weird about it
and why people are coming back to read it now.

124
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,519
Like a brief overlook on everything DC Comics.
It's going to be fun.

125
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,618
MARISHA: It was a weird time.

126
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,556
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was a weird time. It's getting
cooler now.

127
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:08,725
MARISHA: I feel like when people talk about DC
Comics, they just only vaguely talk about DC

128
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,974
Comics these days.

129
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,764
TALIESIN: We're gonna try and see how many
euphemisms we can-- We're going to talk about it

130
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:17,768
like, "I know you think this is a new dog, but
it's really the same dog, he's just better now."

131
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:18,952
Yeah, we're working on it.

132
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:27,257
MATT: And Signal Boost. Our good friend of the
show, David Nett, actually, his episode just went

133
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:31,905
up today. David Nett, who is an amazing dungeon
master. You can actually see him on Round Table,

134
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:38,219
the new show that just hopped up on Alpha. He's
also our trainer, who's been kicking our ass in

135
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:38,928
the gym.

136
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,974
MARISHA: He's our personal trainer. We did a
Hamilton work-out yesterday.

137
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,756
Oh man, it was so cool.

138
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:44,843
MATT: Four sets of core sets.

139
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,717
TALIESIN: Did you take your shots?

140
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:51,824
MARISHA: Well, I rised up when doing squats.

141
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:57,172
MATT: And Peggy, not happy to be there. Perfect.

142
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:02,258
MARISHA: And if you go to iTunes, you can get the
Signal Boost ringtone for your phone and it's

143
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:07,649
pretty great. Also, we have another surprise
coming next week that I'm pretty stoked about, but

144
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,274
you have to wait. No one probably cares. But I
care.

145
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:12,464
LAURA: I'm so excited!

146
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:21,350
MATT: I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm so
scared! For those who don't know what that is,

147
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,373
you're young.

148
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,290
(laughter)

149
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,189
TRAVIS: YouTube it!

150
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:34,942
MATT: All right. Also, today was the episode of
CelebriD&D.

151
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:35,756
LAURA: Oh yay!

152
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:41,137
MATT: There's a preview on YouTube and the full
episode's on Alpha right now. Hopefully they'll

153
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:47,255
bring it out down the road. With Joe Manganiello,
who is legitimately an awesome guy. We got to know

154
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:53,936
him pretty well through the process and he's a
huge old-school RPG-- like, he GM'd GURPS and

155
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:57,935
Rifts for years in the late 80s in a little comic
shop. I would never have guessed. We nerded out

156
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,065
extremely hard. He's one of my new favorite
people.

157
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:01,239
MARISHA: He's pretty cool.

158
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,833
MATT: So check it out. We had a good time.

159
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,039
MARISHA: And he had a cool hat.

160
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,408
MATT: He had a cool hat and a fun character. And
he got to play with a younger Keyleth and Percival

161
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,507
in a one-shot that is technically Exandria-canon.

162
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,077
MARISHA: I was much happier.

163
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,861
TALIESIN: I was not.

164
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,678
MARISHA: No.

165
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:17,843
TALIESIN: You were. I was not.

166
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:22,473
MATT: And, of course, next Tuesday you can come
and see some of us as well as our fantastic host,

167
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:29,520
Brian Wayne Foster, on Talks Machina, Tuesday at
7PM, here on Twitch or Alpha. And don't forget to

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,024
check that out. It will be about this episode.
Now, lest I am mistaken, I think we're done. And

169
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,782
that means it's time--

170
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:39,579
TALIESIN: No!

171
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,587
LAURA: No! No! Hey, look at this cool dice bag I
have, it's got a bear!

172
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,461
MATT: -- to start tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

173
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:45,459
LAURA: Damn it.

174
00:07:45,459 --> 00:09:16,119
[opening credits]

175
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:27,990
MATT: Hello and welcome back, everybody. Nice one,
Laura. Well done. So, bringing us into tonight's

176
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,300
episode. Last we left off, Vox Machina, after
completing their assault and destruction of the

177
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,843
Chroma Conclave, they're tying up loose ends,
various adventure hooks and dangers they'd left

178
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:47,508
out in the open from earlier or during that whole
adventure. After taking Keyleth to Vesrah to take

179
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:53,147
her final trial of the Aramente, her long,
many-year journey to prove her ability to lead her

180
00:09:53,147 --> 00:10:01,124
people, the Air Ashari, you returned to Zephra.
Met her father, expressed that the trial was

181
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:06,546
complete, and the ceremony took place in which
Keyleth was given the mantle and officially titled

182
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:12,076
as the Voice of the Tempest, the now-standing
leader of the Air Ashari. Which, by the way, I'm

183
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,049
supposed to give you this.

184
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,341
MARISHA: What? Was that the thing?

185
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:16,286
MATT: That's the thing.

186
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,879
LAURA: You get another thing?!

187
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,130
MARISHA: I think this is my leadership thing.
Yeah?

188
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,712
MATT: You have your leadership feat.

189
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:22,609
LAURA: That's your mantle!

190
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:23,794
MATT: It's your mantle.

191
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,193
MARISHA: I get another thing?!

192
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,675
MATT: It's nothing crazy. But it's fun.

193
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,928
LAURA: Wait. Is it a cloak? Don't you already have
a cloak on?

194
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,930
TALIESIN: It's a mantle, it only goes to here.

195
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,457
MARISHA: I gave that cloak to Kerr--

196
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:35,030
LIAM: Rothfuss jacked that cloak.

197
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,273
MARISHA: -- who wore it away.

198
00:10:36,273 --> 00:10:38,175
MATT: (laughs) Rothfuss jacked that cloak.

199
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:43,190
TALIESIN: I like to think there's a piece of paper
like pinned to his wall right now.

200
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,881
MATT: He has the stats up there as a reminder?
Framed? Please do that if you haven't already,

201
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:55,968
Pat, please. So, after the ceremony is
completed--

202
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,742
MARISHA: What?!

203
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,630
TALIESIN: Sorry, we're good. Carry on.

204
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,771
TRAVIS: Perfect timing.

205
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:01,857
LIAM: Rehearsal paid off.

206
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:05,609
(laughter)

207
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,703
TALIESIN: Don't feed them.

208
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:13,160
MATT: After the crowning, the ceremony coming to a
close, the evening's celebration kicks off and as

209
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,184
the setting sun begins to darken the sky, the
people of Zephra are now bringing out foods and

210
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:25,019
treats and cakes, and they're putting up ribbons
of blue and white and gold on some of the nearby

211
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:34,014
trees and doorways. And the folks of the Air
Ashari tribe now are in the process of enjoying

212
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:39,547
both the return of their people and the fact that
there is now a clear head of leadership, and you

213
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:48,407
guys are now surrounded, basking in the afterglow
of the event as well as deciding with slow-rising

214
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:54,826
tension what you have as the next step in your
journey. So, what would you guys like to do?

215
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,186
TRAVIS: Charge headlong into danger with no
lessons having been learned

216
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,517
from the previous sessions.

217
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,876
MARISHA: Like it's day one. Vox Machina, let's do
this!

218
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:07,263
TRAVIS: Naked and running in full steam.

219
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:08,281
LIAM: Like right now?

220
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:10,843
TRAVIS: Yeah. No Vestiges, no nothing.

221
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:16,224
LIAM: That would be the best end to that ceremony.
Peace.

222
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,506
MARISHA: It's our save game plus.

223
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:23,667
LAURA: But can I go talk to Keyleth, actually? I
did want to ask you--

224
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,118
MARISHA: Yeah?

225
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:29,817
LAURA: Are you allowed to leave? How does this
work, exactly?

226
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:35,151
MARISHA: I mean, I'm the chief. I can do whatever
I want, right? I don't know, actually.

227
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:36,232
LAURA: Should we talk to your dad?

228
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,484
MARISHA: I should maybe talk to Dad.

229
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,499
LAURA: All right.

230
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,155
MARISHA: Yeah. I go talk to Dad.

231
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,378
(laughter)

232
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:46,470
MATT: Okay. And wherever you walk now, because you
have the mantle upon you and you have the

233
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,793
cascading autumn-colored leaf cloak that flows
behind you, it still seems very ceremonial in this

234
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:58,515
jovial, party-based atmosphere. And as you move,
you still can't help but notice that all eyes are

235
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:02,180
on you at any given point in time. People seem
generally excited that you've returned and that

236
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,989
you've taken up this position. Eventually you make
your way off where you can see there are a handful

237
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:18,165
of the older, the more elder members of the Zephra
tribe. They're around Korren currently, who

238
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:23,534
notices you approach and shushes them all for a
moment, turns to you, "Ah, Keyleth, my daughter.

239
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,395
"How can I help you?"

240
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:28,590
MARISHA: Korren, I was wondering if I could have a
word with you for a minute?

241
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:35,296
MATT: "Of course. You do realise that you can
still call me father. I mean, I know you're the

242
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:37,048
"leader, but--"

243
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:40,068
MARISHA: Can I? Is that allowed? I don't really
know.

244
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:45,498
MATT: He puts his hand up and puts his arm around
your shoulder and guides you off away from the

245
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:53,375
chaos of the celebration. You hear the whistling
of music and flutes and thin tanner drums going

246
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,317
off in the distance. And as it fades the further
off you guys walk in the direction of the tree

247
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:58,459
where the ceremony took place--

248
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,949
(something falls in the background)

249
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,256
MATT: "Oh, sorry."

250
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,515
MARISHA: You should fire that guy.

251
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:03,876
MATT: "I will."

252
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,992
MARISHA: Shitty servants.

253
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,744
MATT: "It's very windy up here. Don't worry about
it."

254
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:09,512
MARISHA: Yes, that's true.

255
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:14,478
MATT: As you walk further away towards the tree,
he takes his arm off from around your shoulder and

256
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:25,006
says, "Now, I understand you have many questions
and we've prepared you as much as we could leading

257
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:28,890
"up to this journey you've gone on, but now you're
here."

258
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,497
MARISHA: I guess.

259
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:39,067
MATT: "Primarily, the people of Zephra look to you
for guidance when choices are hard, difficult."

260
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,322
MARISHA: Okay.

261
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:46,717
MATT: "You are the acting head of law, like I've
been all this time. If there is conflict, if there

262
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:57,875
"is difficulty, if there is a challenge that
presents itself, that requires the wisdom of a

263
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,073
"leader to step in--"

264
00:14:59,073 --> 00:14:59,922
MARISHA: Right.

265
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,650
MATT: "That's when you're called upon."

266
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:17,325
MARISHA: So, (sighs) I'm confused. Was the
Aramente my training to be a leader? You

267
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:24,820
apparently prepared me as best as you could before
I left, I don't know how well you all did

268
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:32,665
(sarcastic laugh). So I'm just wondering if I need
to expect that again, is this just me figuring

269
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,911
this out again? Or do I have guidance?

270
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:46,630
MATT: "The nature of the Aramente is fluid. I have
not taken it as I am not the leader. It is

271
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:56,516
"tradition and it is both, as far as I understand,
a series of challenges and lessons tailored to

272
00:15:56,516 --> 00:16:02,257
"whatever a person seems to be seeking or what you
can draw from that, but also to interface with the

273
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:07,310
"other tribes and establish that connection between
all the leaderships."

274
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:21,503
MARISHA: I did that (laughs). You're right, you
haven't taken it, but that's been about 5% of my

275
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,882
journey, all of the lessons that I've learned have
been in the in-between.

276
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:30,736
MATT: "That is part of the Aramente itself."

277
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:44,380
MARISHA: I know. I guess... I don't know. Just
trying to figure out how to navigate this, like

278
00:16:44,380 --> 00:17:01,191
the leader I'm expected to be. You know, Dad, you
didn't tell me a lot about the world and sometimes

279
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:05,458
I think I get angry at you for that.

280
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:11,165
MATT: "You're not wrong to have these thoughts."

281
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:18,840
MARISHA: Why didn't you tell me that the world
could be so cruel and mean? Why did you never tell

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,312
me that?

283
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:30,287
MATT: "We tried, but you can only tell someone so
much. Do you not think we spent days warning you

284
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:36,078
"of the dangers and difficulty? We didn't thrust
you out in the world with a smile, going 'have fun.'

285
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:43,633
"We told you it was challenging, we warned
you of the people you might interface with that

286
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:55,237
"you couldn't trust. And for the first legs of it,
we had a few scouts keeping an eye."

287
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,688
MARISHA: What?

288
00:17:56,688 --> 00:18:00,761
MATT: "Just to make sure you were safe."

289
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:10,789
MARISHA: Okay. It just sounds like it was advice
coming from people who didn't really fully know.

290
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:19,363
MATT: "To be fair, when every parent has a child
come of age, you can only coddle them so far.

291
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:26,077
"Every bird has to be kicked out of the nest for it
to learn to fly. Not because we want to, but

292
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:29,273
"because that's how things are."

293
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:42,417
MARISHA: I know, and I thank you for that. I guess
I'm just wondering what's next. Now what?

294
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:54,829
MATT: "Now, as leader of these people, you go and
learn how best we can establish ourselves in this

295
00:18:54,897 --> 00:19:08,544
"countryside. Where once we-- (sighs) Gwessar, or
Tal'Dorei as the humans call it, all of our

296
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:18,902
"civilizations are merging. Isolation that we've
relied upon is becoming less and less viable."

297
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,903
MARISHA: I agree.

298
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:31,651
MATT: "And so part of, I think, what you have
already begun, is finding a way to bring not just

299
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:38,520
"the Ashari, but Zephra as well, necessary
friendships and allies."

300
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:48,121
MARISHA: Our people need to be connected to the
rest of the world that we've sworn to protect. I

301
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:58,057
understand the need for our isolation but I often
wonder if we had a few close allies on alert, if

302
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:02,785
the Thordak incident might've have gone a little
bit differently.

303
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,354
MATT: "I agree."

304
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:16,552
MARISHA: I still need time, with Vox Machina. We
still have things we need to complete. And then I

305
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:19,102
promise I will return.

306
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:25,573
MATT: "All right. Come back. Do what you need to.
You're not bound to this mountain. Just know that

307
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:32,112
"your heart is here, and we'll call for you if we
need you. And when you're not needed beyond it,

308
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,563
"this is your home."

309
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:38,482
MARISHA: Thanks, Dad.

310
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:48,910
MATT: "I'm proud of you." And his professional
exterior falls away and he just steps forward and

311
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,758
gives you a big, warm, fatherly embrace and just
holds you there.

312
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:58,204
MARISHA: Okay, Dad. Thank-- okay.

313
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:03,415
MATT: "Sorry." He rights his posture, shoulders
back.

314
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:10,350
MARISHA: I do the same. Adjust my mantle a bit.
Another question. Do I have to wear this like all

315
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:16,776
the time? It's a little unwieldy. It feels a
little froufrou-y. Kind of ceremonial. It's just a

316
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,447
little, feel like I'm going to trip on it.

317
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:23,680
MATT: "You know, do what you like. It's yours."

318
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,592
MARISHA: Okay. 'Cause going upstairs in it, like
in the heels, it's a little unwieldy. I mean, it's

319
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:34,460
beautiful! I'm going to go get a drink.

320
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,661
MATT: "You probably should."

321
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:37,477
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

322
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:38,406
MATT: "All right."

323
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,630
LIAM: You read lips, what're they talking about?

324
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,570
LAURA: Ah, they were talking all about you,
actually.

325
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,777
LIAM: I don't believe you.

326
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:45,721
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,829
LIAM: Why would they be talking about me?

328
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:47,926
LAURA: It's this whole conversation about you.

329
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:48,873
LIAM: You are full of shit.

330
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:52,243
LAURA: No, I heard she was saying how much she
admired you, and he was saying, "Er. I don't think

331
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:57,724
"I feel it as much," and she was like, "No, really,
Dad, you just need a chance to really talk to him,"

332
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:02,401
and he was like, "No, just believe me, I did
talk to him, and I don't feel that way."

333
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,747
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah, I'm--

334
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,621
LAURA: And then she was like-- Never mind.

335
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,182
(laughter)

336
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:14,870
LIAM: I'm so glad I confide in you. I have you to
lean on. You are the rock in my life. What would I

337
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,578
do without you?

338
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:18,179
LAURA: They actually said that, as well. They were
talking about how amazing I am.

339
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,459
(laughter)

340
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:24,422
LIAM: While she's talking I start to walk away,
quietly as possible.

341
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:31,404
TRAVIS: I'm so happy right now.

342
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,163
MARISHA: (laughs) So good.

343
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:37,184
TRAVIS: Ah, deception.

344
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:46,430
MATT: So as the ceremony dies down, the evening
comes to rest, the night sky takes over and you

345
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,528
can still hear the gentle whistling of the winds
through the various cracks and crevices in the

346
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:56,990
mountainside. You are brought to your respective
temporary abodes for the evening to rest, and to

347
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:05,368
plan, and plot what you wish to do going forward.
So, what do you want to do?

348
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:10,378
LIAM: Well, figuratively or literally go to hell,
I imagine.

349
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:14,841
LAURA: Yeah, are we doing this? Tomorrow morning,
we're heading out to hell.

350
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,341
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, what're we going to--

351
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,587
TRAVIS: First things first.

352
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:19,885
LAURA: First things first what, Grog?

353
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:20,819
TRAVIS: Right.

354
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:21,670
LIAM: Squad leader.

355
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,154
(laughter)

356
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,640
TRAVIS: How do we get there?

357
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,867
LAURA: Oh, she's got Plane Shift, right?

358
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:27,737
MARISHA: I can get us there.

359
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:29,105
TALIESIN: Very easily, actually. That's the easy
part.

360
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:30,539
TRAVIS: We don't take, like, a ship?

361
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,713
TALIESIN: No, sadly we can't.

362
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:32,646
LAURA: No ships.

363
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:35,216
LIAM: No, but we don't know exactly where we're
going to land, right?

364
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,102
MARISHA: Correct.

365
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:37,672
LAURA: Well, we know the city that we want to go
to.

366
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:40,273
MARISHA: I can get us somewhere within the City of
Dis. I don't know if--

367
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:41,362
LAURA: Dis city.

368
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:43,072
MARISHA: Built Dis city!

369
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:48,459
LIAM: Man. This is going to go great.

370
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,146
MARISHA: It was too easy!

371
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:54,370
LIAM: I mean, when we went to the City of Brass,
we did not shift into the City of Brass. We dumped

372
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,452
quite a ways away.

373
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,165
MARISHA: It was, yeah. But on the outskirts.

374
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:01,002
LIAM: Yeah. So we have no control over that, so--

375
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:03,282
LAURA: We could pop into it. We could pop out of
it.

376
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:09,709
LIAM: Yeah. So, whatever plan we come up with, one
branch of the future is complete bullshit

377
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,057
improvisation for if we fall into the shit.

378
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:13,989
TRAVIS: Right.

379
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:18,397
LIAM: So there's no planning for that. So if we
don't fall into the shit and we land somewhere

380
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:22,723
relatively safe, what're we going to do? How're we
going to play this? This is hell.

381
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:27,619
TALIESIN: Well, it is complicated. And, as hells
go, there could be worse hells.

382
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,548
I've been reading.

383
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:33,135
LIAM: Shocking.

384
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:39,834
TALIESIN: Thank you. I've been looking into this,
and it seems that where we're going has a very,

385
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:48,999
very structured hierarchy. It's very ordered, the
society makes sense, and wherever we find this

386
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:54,932
creature that we have to slay, there will probably
already be forces working against him that will be

387
00:24:54,932 --> 00:25:03,878
happy to ally with us to help that happen. They're
vicious psychopathic creatures that only function

388
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,509
because they maintain these rules with each other
about how they're supposed to act.

389
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:08,784
LAURA: It's very ordered.

390
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:13,739
TALIESIN: I think it would be possible to find
people who would be delighted for outsiders to

391
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:16,168
come in and do their dirty work for them.

392
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:26,219
LAURA: However, Scalebearer, big high guy. Really
important guy said not to make a scene. He said if

393
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:30,726
we make a scene, that would go poorly.

394
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:31,950
TALIESIN: Yes.

395
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,309
TRAVIS: Says him. Psh.

396
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:37,867
LIAM: There's no point for sextuplets. We can't do
that. That's not going to work.

397
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:43,509
TALIESIN: No. They can see through things. It's
going to be complicated as well because we have

398
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,839
value as well.

399
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:51,168
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it! We kidnap the president of
hell and we assume his visage.

400
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:52,957
LIAM: What's a president?

401
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:57,628
TALIESIN: His name is Asmodeus. And no, we are not
kidnapping Asmodeus of Hell.

402
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:59,444
TRAVIS: Why?

403
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:02,296
LAURA: I think he's probably kind of powerful.

404
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:03,776
LIAM: He's really heavy.

405
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,871
LAURA: Might be hard to lift him up.

406
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,301
TRAVIS: Have you seen him?

407
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,418
TALIESIN: I've seen sketches.

408
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,436
LAURA: You have?

409
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:14,554
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, I mean, I don't know how
correct these are--

410
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:16,113
LAURA: Morning! Morning has come!

411
00:26:16,113 --> 00:26:16,972
MARISHA: Oh, wow!

412
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,036
TALIESIN: Oh, my.

413
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,710
MARISHA: These are a power surge in there.

414
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,483
LIAM: We talked all night and we squared it away
and we're going to hell!

415
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:24,412
MATT: You talked all through the night. No rest
was had.

416
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,790
(laughter)

417
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,362
MARISHA: It's very bright.

418
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:34,657
TALIESIN: We're going to be offered things there.
There's going to be deals made.

419
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:39,858
LIAM: So we're talking negotiation or bullshitting
our way. One or the other--

420
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:43,562
TALIESIN: It's going to be negotiating, probably
with someone who'll give us cover if we do some

421
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,617
dirty work.

422
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:47,230
LAURA: I mean, is it similar to the City of Brass?
It sounds so similar.

423
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,775
TALIESIN: They have a lot in common, yes. It's
even more structured, though. There's quite a

424
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:59,792
complex-- I alone have identified 13 different
caste systems within their function.

425
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:00,982
LIAM: Caste systems?

426
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:06,032
TALIESIN: There's imps, spine devils, barbed
devils, chain devils, bone devils. There's all

427
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:10,171
these different kinds of devil, and each devil has
to answer to a different devil. They answer

428
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:16,044
specifically to the devils that have fealty over
them, who in turn are at constant war with the

429
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:20,921
devils who are in fealty to other devils, and
archdevils, and greater devils, who in turn all

430
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:24,055
owe their fealty to Asmodeus.

431
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,564
LAURA: But we are not devils.

432
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:26,812
TALIESIN: We are not devils.

433
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,850
LAURA: Therefore, weak and liable to be taken as
slaves.

434
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,377
TALIESIN: We are not even slaves. We are
consumables.

435
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:41,827
MARISHA: I don't know. I feel like we've gotten a
bit of a reputation for ourselves. I'm sure that

436
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,508
word has spread. We're not, you know--

437
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:46,754
MATT: You would know this.

438
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:47,656
TALIESIN: Yes.

439
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:54,245
MATT: Percy, through your research. It's not
terribly uncommon for mortals to wander through

440
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:02,070
the City of Dis specifically because it is where
goods, gold, and largely souls are traded to and

441
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:11,304
from various structures or entities within the
hells and beyond. To just consume or eat someone

442
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:18,588
means nothing. The true worth of a soul is in
corrupting it. And they do so through enticing,

443
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:26,366
through corrupting their morals, through driving
mortals through bargains and pacts to end up

444
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:34,760
twisting into entities of order and evil as well,
and then claim the soul of that. Contracts are a

445
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,073
big thing.

446
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,930
TALIESIN: And then turning that into a lemure.
Yes.

447
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:43,006
MATT: Yeah, into a lemure, or other forms of
soul-based energy. But contracts are a very, very

448
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:46,285
important part of the whole economy.

449
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:50,832
LAURA: So the person that we made a contract with
was a devil that ended up being the one that

450
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:54,518
killed Pike, right? That was a devil disguised as
a demon?

451
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:57,639
MATT: Ah, no. That was a demon disguised as a
devil.

452
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,986
MARISHA: Yeah, that was super confusing.

453
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:00,793
LAURA: Okay.

454
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:01,821
MATT: Confusing?

455
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,166
MARISHA: That was the one that we wished our way
out of the contract.

456
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,309
MATT: Correct. Yes.

457
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,416
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't really have that anymore.

458
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,526
TALIESIN: I was very proud of that.

459
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:08,509
LAURA: Yeah, we don't have a wish. Okay, so we
make no deals when we go.

460
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:09,517
MARISHA: No deals. No contracts.

461
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:11,849
LAURA: No deals. No contracts. No shaking of
hands. No signing of anything.

462
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:14,027
TALIESIN: No accepting of gifts.

463
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,038
TRAVIS: Feel like I'm going to forget this.

464
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,112
TALIESIN: You are.

465
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:18,384
MARISHA: Just don't touch anything.

466
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:20,056
LAURA: Oh no. Don't touch anything.

467
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:22,283
TALIESIN: Might have to make you special gloves
that don't have any fingers.

468
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:23,910
TRAVIS: I've got special gloves.

469
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,329
TALIESIN: Even specialer gloves.

470
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,090
MARISHA: Like a muff.

471
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,388
LAURA: That we can wear over those gloves.

472
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:28,290
TRAVIS: Like a what?

473
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,698
MARISHA: Like a hand muff.

474
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,692
(laughter)

475
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:34,438
TRAVIS: You're going to make me a special hand
muff?

476
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,197
(laughter)

477
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:37,518
MATT: Taryon does pipe in, he's like--

478
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:38,938
MARISHA: We could put little ears on, we can make
it like a kitten!

479
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:41,867
MATT: "Oh, but I've such fine handwriting! If we
need to sign anything, just let me know. I'm happy to."

480
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:42,959
LAURA: No, Tary, no signing anything.

481
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:43,703
MARISHA: Nope.

482
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:45,113
MATT: "I've signed a lot of contracts in my time.
My father used--"

483
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,078
LAURA: No signing of contracts.

484
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,604
MATT: "-- to do contracts throughout the
countryside."

485
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:49,613
LAURA: Although I'm sure you're good at reading
contracts as well.

486
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:50,427
MATT: "This is true!"

487
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:53,995
LAURA: Yes. You can read them, but don't sign
them. How about that?

488
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:56,190
MATT: "How about if I read them and I like it?"

489
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,378
LAURA: No. No signing.

490
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,637
(laughter)

491
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:01,708
LAURA: Unless you want to stay in hell.

492
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,229
MATT: "Agree to disagree."

493
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:04,500
LAURA: And we come back here.

494
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,896
TALIESIN: Your current contract with us actually
stipulates that you can't have another contract

495
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,820
enacted until you confer with all of us.

496
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,598
MARISHA: Exclusivity.

497
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:10,284
TALIESIN: Yes.

498
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:15,287
MATT: He goes through his bag and pulls out the
contract. "I stand corrected."

499
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,647
TALIESIN: I'm very thorough.

500
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:20,167
LAURA: I don't even remember he signed a
contract.

501
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:23,740
MATT: "Doty, write this down. Be more careful
about exclusivity in future contracts."

502
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,282
(laughter)

503
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,314
TALIESIN: I don't think you were there. This might
have been just him and me getting

504
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:29,808
drunk at one point.

505
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:36,418
TRAVIS: Is there any worth to only a few people,
or one or two, going in to get a lay of the land,

506
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:41,981
once we get there? Instead of just moving in our
truffle-shuffle normal formation.

507
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:48,121
LAURA: I feel like that could be very dangerous,
for one person to go in alone.

508
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,545
LIAM: Yes, I agree.

509
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:50,785
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

510
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:51,890
LAURA: Grog, no.

511
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,749
LIAM: No.

512
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:53,821
TRAVIS: I'm very stealthy.

513
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:57,251
LAURA: Last time you were alone-ish, you almost
killed two guards.

514
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,280
TRAVIS: What is the problem with that?

515
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,816
LAURA: In Vasselheim.

516
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:05,343
TRAVIS: We got away with it, right? Did we get
caught? Did we get caught, Tary?

517
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:07,579
MATT: "No! We did-- Did we get caught?"

518
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:08,773
TRAVIS: No.

519
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:12,076
MATT: "I don't know. I still have-- I only
remember half of what happened."

520
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:16,617
TRAVIS: Tary is very excited about my plan. It's
affecting his memory of what happened.

521
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:17,749
LAURA: Right.

522
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:21,880
MATT: "I think I blocked it out. But what I
remember was interesting."

523
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,368
LAURA: You could always look in Doty's diary and
find out exactly what happened.

524
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:31,734
TRAVIS: Yeah, peruse the last 90 pages for the
last hour.

525
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:35,814
MATT: Takes the book and starts thumbing through
real fast. You look over at Doty who still has

526
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:40,233
chunks and clusters of bits of red hair from the
somewhat removed goatee.

527
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,295
LAURA: Fu Manchu?

528
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,255
MATT: Yeah. His secret goatee.

529
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:49,630
MARISHA: So, Percy. We know a lot of things and
people move through the Nine Hells. What does it

530
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,515
say about rakshasas in there? Where do they fall
in the caste?

531
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:57,059
TALIESIN: It doesn't actually say where rakshasas
would fall in the caste, does it?

532
00:31:57,284 --> 00:32:03,724
MATT: There wasn't a terrible lot of information.
Not all the devils are in the same system. There

533
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:11,259
is a promotion-demotion system in which devils
advance and are demoted based on their elements

534
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:15,920
there. But there are other fiends that exist in
that space that aren't part of that system.

535
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,967
Rakshasas are a little bit outside of that system.
Succubi, incubi, they're a little bit outside of

536
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:24,750
that system. There are other fiendish creatures
that actually traverse between both the Abyss and

537
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,640
the Hells based on what their interests are. So
that's predominantly the structure of the devils

538
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,965
that are--

539
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,010
TALIESIN: In Dis?

540
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,983
MATT: Well, that are built within the Hells as
their primary domain.

541
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:42,314
LIAM: Percy, help me understand, since you've read
so much about this.

542
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:44,891
TALIESIN: Yes. Whole page.

543
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:47,031
(laughter)

544
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:54,679
LIAM: Good on you. So if the Raven Queen escorts
souls-- If you're an absolute, terrible shit of a

545
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,793
person and the Raven Queen escorts you over to the
other side, we're going to be wandering amongst the

546
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:05,809
souls of the damned? People who die go to where
we're going?

547
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:08,616
TALIESIN: If they're under contract, this is where
they go.

548
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:11,605
MATT: And many who sometimes aren't under contract
go there as well.

549
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:12,740
LAURA: Oh really?

550
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,489
MATT: And you would know this, actually. The Raven
Queen, as part of the laws of the cosmos that hold

551
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:25,216
the various planes together, the Raven Queen does
indeed escort good souls to the positive planes,

552
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:29,534
the upper planes, and not-so-good souls to the
lower ones.

553
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:34,116
LAURA: Actually, I know that from reading a lot
about the Raven Queen. I can answer that for you.

554
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:37,674
TRAVIS: If you don't use a turn signal, if you
have a vanity plate, you go to hell.

555
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:38,920
(laughter)

556
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,682
LIAM: Thank you. I know they get escorted to the
other side. It just seems like an odd idea to be

557
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:51,336
walking in a city full of the thrown-away. I'm
talking to the air right now.

558
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:53,261
TALIESIN: No, we're absolutely listening.

559
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:54,467
LAURA: I'm sorry. Keep going.

560
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,634
LIAM: It was the best thing you never heard.

561
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,151
(laughter)

562
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,600
TALIESIN: That changed the game forever.

563
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,974
LIAM: I miss Scanlan Shorthalt so badly.

564
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:03,464
MARISHA: Because he listened to you so much more?

565
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:05,190
LIAM: No, he's just my buddy.

566
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,723
ALL: Aww.

567
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:09,470
TALIESIN: Speaking of just our buddy--

568
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,058
MARISHA: As we move on.

569
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:16,444
TALIESIN: -- Pike is another concern. I would feel
far more comfortable making sure that she is

570
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:18,439
definitely on board for this.

571
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,053
TRAVIS: Really?

572
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:26,170
LAURA: Well, that's difficult.

573
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:32,628
LIAM: Phone a friend? What do we do?

574
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:38,653
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've been thinking about
that, the best way to--

575
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:41,340
LIAM: I mean, Hotis-- How long has it been, DM?

576
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,547
MATT: Since?

577
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,606
LIAM: Since Pike wasted his sorry ass.

578
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:51,406
MATT: It's been, offhand, a couple of months.

579
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:59,835
LIAM: A couple months. I mean, I don't think one
more day is going to kill us, if we want to go get

580
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:05,925
her. You know.

581
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,440
(laughter)

582
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,694
LAURA: That's difficult.

583
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:11,661
(laughter)

584
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:17,403
TALIESIN: I know, I do bring it up, though, that
it is one those things that we should talk about.

585
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:18,999
LIAM: I mean, if the fates allow.

586
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:24,274
MARISHA: Yes. I feel like we would have to find
someone to Send Message.

587
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:25,206
LAURA: Yeah.

588
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,727
MARISHA: There is a Message spell, maybe in the
form of a text.

589
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,497
MATT: Just blackmail the writers of Blindspot.

590
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:30,161
LAURA: Yeah.

591
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,336
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

592
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,175
LAURA: Ashley is in New York. (laughs)

593
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,429
TALIESIN: This is one of those things where I
thought I would just bring it up now before we go

594
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,381
running in there.

595
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:40,495
LIAM: Oh, I was just trying to guilt Matt into
playing Pike, but--

596
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:41,745
TALIESIN: I am okay with that too.

597
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:43,298
LAURA: No, it's Ashley's character, though.

598
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:44,464
MARISHA: I mean we kind of did--

599
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,055
TRAVIS: Pike, Tary, what else? (laughs)

600
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:47,535
MATT: Yeah, just throw all the NPCs at me.

601
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:48,481
(laughing)

602
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,767
LIAM: It's not the Thordak battle, there's not 87
miniatures on the board!

603
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:53,364
LAURA: No, but I mean, it could be, we don't
know.

604
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:54,451
LIAM: All right, well, we're all going to die.

605
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:56,705
MARISHA: We'd also have to see if Ashley would be
down with us, you know--

606
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:57,947
TALIESIN: I thought I would bring it up.

607
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,624
MARISHA: -- Kaiju-ing Pike once again.

608
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,878
TALIESIN: I just thought I would bring it up--

609
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:02,114
MATT: You guys could Jaeger her again.

610
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:03,611
TALIESIN: -- 'cause it is one of those things that
is pretty clutch down there.

611
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:04,899
LIAM: Not prepared, but we never are.

612
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:09,146
TRAVIS: Nope. So we kidnap the president.

613
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,867
(laughter)

614
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,950
LAURA: Definitely. I'm liking it more.

615
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:21,236
MARISHA: So, I'm curious, if-- Rakshasas aren't
necessarily part of the system, and this guy tends

616
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:32,155
to come in and out and just make people's lives a
living hell. (laughs) Hell! We're going! Puns!

617
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,669
TRAVIS: Good. Slick.

618
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:40,170
MARISHA: Then maybe no one would miss him. In
fact, maybe people down there don't like him.

619
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,732
You know?

620
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:46,150
TALIESIN: The feeling I get reading-- the more I
read about this place, is no one likes anybody down

621
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,832
there, and so if we can figure out a way to be
convenient about it, you can disappear anybody.

622
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:56,966
LIAM: Also, didn't someone tell us that if they
get trashed they are treated like shit there?

623
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,915
TALIESIN: He's probably not well-respected.

624
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,248
LIAM: We've trashed his ass twice.

625
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:05,853
TRAVIS: When we went to the City of Brass we were
owned, right? That's what let us move

626
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,593
around so freely?

627
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,272
TALIESIN: We don't have to do that here.

628
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:10,400
LAURA: Are you sure-- okay.

629
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,259
LIAM: (sighs) I mean, we thought it was getting us
around but it clearly wasn't.

630
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,136
TRAVIS: There's nothing that we need to think
about like that so that we have--

631
00:37:14,136 --> 00:37:18,036
LAURA: So we should just go down, act like we're
evils, like our souls have been claimed by another

632
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,431
devil already.

633
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:22,247
TALIESIN: Honestly, the more we act like us, the
more people are going to try to

634
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:24,021
tempt us into things.

635
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:27,706
MARISHA: I could use Alter Self or try and change
into something that's devil-y.

636
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,158
LAURA: Can't they see through that?

637
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:30,824
TALIESIN: They'll probably see through it.

638
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:32,654
MARISHA: I have a question.

639
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:33,421
MATT: Yes?

640
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:35,172
MARISHA: Because that is an interesting question,
because--

641
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:38,145
MATT: Illusions are different than actually
physically changing yourself.

642
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:39,465
MARISHA: Right. It's transmutation--

643
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,316
MATT: Correct.

644
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:43,797
MARISHA: Because Shapechange is considered a
transmutation spell, whereas Seeming was an

645
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:44,780
illusion spell.

646
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,820
MATT: Seeming was an illusion. Illusions and--

647
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,196
TRAVIS: You actually become that thing.

648
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:51,543
MATT: As far as you know, the pit fiend you
encountered is the only creature that saw through

649
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,506
an illusion.

650
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:53,562
LAURA: Okay.

651
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,799
MATT: However, illusions and transmutation spells,
things that actually physically alter your form,

652
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:02,531
that's not considered an illusion. You are
actually changing your physicality, so Alter Self

653
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,757
would not be something that a creature with
Truesight could see through.

654
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:08,606
MARISHA: Can I Alter Self to a succubus?

655
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:10,583
MATT: I mean, you could alter yourself to look
more--

656
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,649
MARISHA: To look like one.

657
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,928
MATT: -- like one. Maybe, yeah.

658
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:14,568
MARISHA: Or like a tiefling?

659
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:16,066
MATT: I mean, you wouldn't be able to give
yourself wings.

660
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,258
MARISHA: Are tieflings a thing in the City of Dis?

661
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,410
MATT: You don't know.

662
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,532
MARISHA: Percy, are tieflings a thing in the City
of Dis?

663
00:38:24,532 --> 00:38:25,604
TALIESIN: I don't know.

664
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:26,640
MATT: Ah, actually--

665
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,897
(laughter)

666
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:29,249
TALIESIN: Would I know? It's not on the page. You
gave me one page.

667
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:30,775
LIAM: If you just think for a second.

668
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,499
MATT: I know, I know. Well, before I gave you a
basic structure and I am filling

669
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:33,431
in the gaps as we go.

670
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:34,816
TALIESIN: Sure, thank you.

671
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:45,103
MATT: Yes, they are quite often found there. That
is specifically a city that a lot of the social

672
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:50,387
construct revolves around the cross-section
between the mortal races and devils.

673
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:56,328
MARISHA: I wonder if they have guides. I wonder if
I can be like a tiefling tour guide for you guys.

674
00:38:56,328 --> 00:39:00,062
LAURA: Maybe you could be our conduit, the person
that brings us to--

675
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:02,047
MARISHA: Yeah, like an ambassador, an escort.

676
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:03,840
TALIESIN: Already have us under contract.

677
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,902
MARISHA: Already have you under contract.

678
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:07,515
LAURA: Sure.

679
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,751
TRAVIS: Yeah.

680
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:11,900
TALIESIN: Do you feel up to this level of
deception? I say with all seriousness.

681
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,048
MARISHA: (inhales) You know it's not my strongest
suit, and I recognize this.

682
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:21,410
LAURA: Wait, wait, Tary. Do you have anything,
like a spell you can make, any kind of trinket,

683
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,135
(laughs) that would help Keyleth be better at
lying?

684
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:34,421
MATT: "Oh, well, I do believe that I can enhance
somebody's visage."

685
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:40,723
LAURA: Well, not that, no. I'm talking an actual
like ability to tell lies better. Something that

686
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,766
would up her maybe charisma?

687
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,674
MARISHA: Does he have Enhance Ability? Is that
what you are talking about?

688
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,746
MATT: Yeah.

689
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:49,129
MARISHA: He can give me Enhance Ability which
means I would get advantage on checks.

690
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:50,234
LAURA: That's better.

691
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:57,655
MARISHA: Which I can do on myself as well. Yeah.
So, yeah, I can give myself, you know, I can--

692
00:39:57,655 --> 00:40:00,332
MATT: "But I can do it as well, and probably a
little better."

693
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:03,250
MARISHA: And Tary can do it as well. I'll talk
into a mirror for a little bit, practice some

694
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,117
things that tieflings might say. What are things
tieflings say?

695
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:10,208
TALIESIN: Oh God, I'm a tiefling. What happened?
Why has this happened to me?

696
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,412
MARISHA: "Oh God, I'm a tiefling. What happened?
Why is this happening to me?" See?

697
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,687
LAURA: That's perfect, that's perfect.

698
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:15,795
TALIESIN: It's uncanny.

699
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:17,287
TRAVIS: I don't believe you.

700
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:24,074
LIAM: We are so close to being able to semi-retire
and take it easy. We cannot cock this up. We're

701
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:34,913
going to hell, we've no plan! What if we went and
were completely honest, and were ourselves? And

702
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:39,885
explained that we were here to remove the
shittiest devil in the city?

703
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:41,189
LAURA: Seriously? Seriously?

704
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,217
LIAM: I am being serious.

705
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:43,402
TRAVIS: Yeah, he does have a slight point.

706
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:47,961
LIAM: We tried that. We've tried that. I mean,
maybe it'll work. We just run willy-nilly. That's

707
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:48,875
what we do.

708
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,496
TRAVIS: Maybe we do them a favor, it's not like
we're saying--

709
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:55,216
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that a bunch of
mortals show up in the City of Dis looking for a

710
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:58,306
rakshasa, I think they're going to be able to put
two and two together.

711
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:01,040
MARISHA: Why? Yeah, they're going to know. I
honestly don't think anyone's going to have a

712
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,479
problem with us killing this guy. It's just a
matter of do we want to be full Vox Machina?

713
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:11,698
Because it might paint a giant target on us. Or
maybe have someone as a silent escort? I could try

714
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:13,639
and not speak a whole lot.

715
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,434
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, you could--

716
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:20,565
MARISHA: I could just-- maybe I could be a mute
escort? I had my tongue cut out.

717
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:24,840
LIAM: I mean, I just feel like our-- certainly
without Scanman-- our chances of fooling anybody

718
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,919
are lower than they've ever been. So maybe having
you as a tiefling escort gives a little

719
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,594
credibility to the dummies there.

720
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:34,655
LAURA: Yeah.

721
00:41:34,655 --> 00:41:37,648
LIAM: There's lots of people who're not dummies, 
though, and I feel like we should just quietly

722
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:41,780
negotiate our way through, because I don't think
we can bullshit, not without Scanlan.

723
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,178
TALIESIN: I think that's very fair.

724
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:43,827
MARISHA: Yeah.

725
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:44,544
LAURA: All right.

726
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,113
MARISHA: I agree. Okay.

727
00:41:46,113 --> 00:41:48,134
TRAVIS: I got lost, but I agree.

728
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:56,941
LAURA: Did you ever get a response from Sam on his
potions? So, I didn't want to tell.

729
00:41:56,941 --> 00:42:02,570
LIAM: Six regular, three medium, one superstar. If
you need gold, I've got loads.

730
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,894
TRAVIS: It's literally right there.

731
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:07,673
LAURA: Oh. I didn't know you wrote it down, Grog.

732
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:09,227
TRAVIS: Motherfuck--

733
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,872
LAURA: You can't count.

734
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:15,128
Okay, we gotta pass these potions out. Who
wants a superior?

735
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:16,584
LIAM: I do.

736
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:18,453
TRAVIS: Oh, do you have those potions?

737
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,765
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, Tary gave them to me.

738
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:22,450
TALIESIN: They were gift-wrapped and everything.

739
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,555
LAURA: Did you steal them from me when I wasn't
noticing? Because if you did I would have

740
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:26,496
perceived it.

741
00:42:26,496 --> 00:42:27,793
MATT: "I did, sorry."

742
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:28,822
TRAVIS: Perceived it?

743
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:30,776
LAURA: Yeah, I would have. Because I have really
high perceiving.

744
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:32,816
MATT: "I thought that's why you wanted it
gift-wrapped."

745
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,342
LAURA: Yeah.

746
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:38,519
LIAM: I'll take any-- I forget the sizes, is it
venti, or grande?

747
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,655
LAURA: I don't want you dying again. Take the
superior.

748
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:41,716
LIAM: Ooh, thank you.

749
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:43,174
LAURA: Is that all right with everyone?

750
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:44,439
TALIESIN: Yes, that's perfectly fine.

751
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,479
MATT: "I will say I did buy them, if I could
also--"

752
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:51,088
LAURA: Really, Tary? Because you have all those
patches, I thought that's the reason you gave them

753
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:52,019
to us.

754
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,070
MATT: "Oh, but they're measly trifles of healing,
I could use something--"

755
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,198
LIAM: Tary, how tough is that armor?

756
00:42:58,198 --> 00:43:01,172
MATT: "The best that money could buy."

757
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:05,246
LIAM: Yeah, but is it ceremonial or is it like
shit-kicker?

758
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:06,474
MATT: "It's functional."

759
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:11,671
LAURA: Do you want two regular potions, how is
that, Tary? Is that good for you? In addition to

760
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:16,367
your patches? Or would you want one of the
greaters that you bought for us?

761
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:17,461
MATT: "Greater."

762
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,472
LAURA: Wow, all right, sure, take it back.

763
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,436
TALIESIN: (laughs) I'm so sad Sam couldn't be here
for that.

764
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,741
LAURA: Okay, I'll take a greater as well.

765
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:27,208
MARISHA: All right.

766
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,790
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't want to give me
one? Because I usually end up pouring it into one

767
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:31,766
of you sloppy saps.

768
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:33,364
LAURA: Good call. Greater for Grog.

769
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:34,534
LIAM: That's a good idea.

770
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:35,910
LAURA: So that's all three greaters taken.

771
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,375
TALIESIN: I'll take two regular if you've got
them.

772
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,615
LAURA: Two regulars for Percy, two regulars for
Keyleth.

773
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:41,680
MARISHA: Sure.

774
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,792
LAURA: And that's-- well, that's two regulars
left.

775
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,675
LIAM: That's like strapping a turkey baster to a
tank, that's what that is.

776
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:48,807
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

777
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:51,296
MARISHA: I would maybe just keep those or give
them to Grog maybe, once again.

778
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,498
TRAVIS: Get up. (laughs)

779
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:53,347
LAURA: Okay, so Grog.

780
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,139
TRAVIS: What?

781
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,983
LAURA: You have two regulars and one greater.

782
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:58,089
TRAVIS: Yarr.

783
00:43:58,089 --> 00:43:59,831
LAURA: All right.

784
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:06,825
LIAM: Fred, Freddie. Do we know what languages are
likely to be spoken there?

785
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:07,862
TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

786
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,060
LIAM: Does that say in your books?

787
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,698
MARISHA: Did you just call Percy 'Freddie'? I like
it.

788
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:12,845
LAURA: He keeps calling him that.

789
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:13,800
MATT: Infernal.

790
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,197
LIAM: It's his name, isn't it?

791
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,090
TRAVIS: Frederick.

792
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,346
TALIESIN: Infernal? They speak Infernal.
Technically it would be a middle name.

793
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:21,168
LIAM: Do you speak Infernal? Well, it is--

794
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:22,294
TALIESIN: I do not speak Infernal.

795
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:26,280
LIAM: -- your name, is it not? You have 37 of
them, am I allowed to use any of ones between the

796
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,545
first and the last?

797
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:31,246
TALIESIN: I am struggling to find a reason why
not, which is somewhat irritating.

798
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:34,347
LIAM: You know, we're years into being friends.
What do you prefer?

799
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:36,417
TALIESIN: Percy is just perfectly reasonable.

800
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:38,117
TRAVIS: What about D-Roll?

801
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:38,840
LAURA: What about Von?

802
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,892
MARISHA: D-Roll's pretty good.

803
00:44:39,892 --> 00:44:40,783
LIAM: D-Roll--

804
00:44:40,783 --> 00:44:42,283
LAURA: What about Musel?

805
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:44,143
LIAM: Oh jeez, I was just about to agree on it
but--

806
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,505
TALIESIN: My god, you've found the line, and I've
drawn it.

807
00:44:46,505 --> 00:44:49,575
LIAM: I don't know, D-Roll's pretty good. Man,
D-Roll's great!

808
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:51,666
TALIESIN: D-Roll is actually pretty slick.

809
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:58,543
LIAM: I'm suddenly extremely jealous of Grog for
coming up with that name. Oh man, yeah, that's

810
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:00,096
going to haunt you, my friend.

811
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:02,744
TALIESIN: You're just going to end up Wings
someday, that's all I'm saying.

812
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:06,667
LIAM: Y'all wanna stop and get a wing?

813
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,465
LAURA: Infernal. But they speak Common, I'm
assuming, as well.

814
00:45:09,465 --> 00:45:12,908
MATT: You don't know. You really don't know.

815
00:45:12,908 --> 00:45:15,219
LAURA: Ah, shit. We don't know anybody who speaks
Infernal, do we?

816
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,255
MARISHA: Hey, Tary.

817
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,209
LIAM: What about Zahra?

818
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:21,652
MARISHA: Do you have any spells that help you be
able to speak languages? Isn't there a spell

819
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,266
called Languages?

820
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:29,409
MATT: "Not at the moment. However, if we have
enough time, I'm sure we could go and find a local

821
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:37,182
"class that teaches, maybe go to the Lyceum and we
could learn the basics. Few weeks."

822
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:38,947
TRAVIS: Tary, do you want me to punch you in the
face?

823
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:48,465
MATT: "No, I do not. Please, don't do that. Which,
by the way, if we need any sort of healing--" And

824
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:55,103
he rummages through his pouch here and says, "I
can muster a couple of short-term potions if it

825
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:56,925
"gets too bad."

826
00:45:56,925 --> 00:46:01,102
LAURA: Why did you take one of the greaters if you
can make healing potions on your own?

827
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:04,196
MATT: "Well, I can only really use one for myself,
and I wanted a backup."

828
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:05,651
LAURA: Right.

829
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:12,077
TALIESIN: So Infernal is going to be a problem.

830
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:15,775
LIAM: And we're taking Doty with us? Is that the
plan?

831
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:18,789
MATT: "I don't see why we wouldn't. Why would we
not want to bring him with us?"

832
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,136
LIAM: I'm sure there's lots of robits in hell.

833
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:23,218
TALIESIN: Does Doty speak Infernal?

834
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:26,140
MATT: "Doty doesn't speak."

835
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,572
TALIESIN: Can he write in Infernal?

836
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:31,845
LIAM: Is he a protocol droid?

837
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:35,328
MATT: This is where it would be useful for Sam to
send me his character sheet so I would know what

838
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:41,953
languages he chose. But because Sam's not here,
no. Doty does not know or speak Infernal.

839
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,738
LIAM: Somewhere an aerator's going (raspberry).

840
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:46,402
TRAVIS: Sam's stuff is right there, isn't it?

841
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,280
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

842
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,056
TALIESIN: No, that's my stuff. I'm spreading
because he's not here.

843
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:51,310
LAURA: Understandable.

844
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,648
MARISHA: Not really.

845
00:46:52,648 --> 00:46:54,515
LAURA: Man-spreading.

846
00:46:54,515 --> 00:47:00,075
TRAVIS: Can we tear off your sleeve and then you
understand Infernal?

847
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:03,868
MATT: "No, you don't need to do that."

848
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:04,746
TRAVIS: We could try.

849
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:05,939
MATT: "I would not recommend it."

850
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:09,159
TALIESIN: I speak Disco, but not Infernal.

851
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,836
LAURA: No.

852
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:12,779
TALIESIN: So sorry.

853
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:13,780
MARISHA: (sings) Disco Inferno.

854
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,018
TALIESIN: I'm not really that sorry.

855
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,808
TRAVIS: You can't just off-the-cuff that. You've
gotta save that for something.

856
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:23,370
TALIESIN: That was for the Aladdin earlier. I had
to do something in retaliation. We're looking to

857
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,114
see if anything--

858
00:47:25,114 --> 00:47:27,575
LAURA: I speak Abyssal, but that's the other
ones.

859
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:28,788
LIAM: That's the other guys.

860
00:47:28,788 --> 00:47:32,925
MARISHA: I mean, if I wanted to use Shapechange to
actually turn myself into--

861
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:33,879
LAURA: A succubus.

862
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:40,301
MARISHA: -- a succubus or a rakshasa, then I would
speak Infernal because I do get that with-- we

863
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:43,429
didn't really fully decide. It never specifies.

864
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,292
MATT: I would say, yeah.

865
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:48,670
MARISHA: Because you get everything, but you just
keep your intellect, wisdom, and--

866
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,741
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that!

867
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,900
LIAM: You get a whole other language?

868
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,831
LAURA: Tight, then make yourself a succubus.

869
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:55,199
MATT: Well, no, you keep your intellect, it's not
like you learn what the creature would know. So

870
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,035
probably not.

871
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:59,648
MARISHA: But you learn their spells and abilities.
You automatically get those.

872
00:47:59,648 --> 00:48:04,030
LIAM: Are the spells in the brain, though? Or in
the body?

873
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,271
MARISHA: It doesn't specify in the spell. It's
kind of what you decide.

874
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:10,501
TALIESIN: It depends on what kind of spell. Like,
elemental spells--

875
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,500
LAURA: I really want to see what you look like as
a succubus, personally.

876
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,385
TALIESIN: I do, too. This picture they have in the
book is quite exciting.

877
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:17,648
MARISHA: Yeah, she's got a whip.

878
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:18,740
TALIESIN: Yes, she does.

879
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,392
MATT: Any average example of that creature, one
without any class levels or the spellcasting

880
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:25,530
trait. So you don't get any spells. If you turn
into something that has spellcasting, you don't

881
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,598
get their spells. You maintain your intellect--

882
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:30,184
MARISHA: But I get their abilities.

883
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:32,281
MATT: You get their abilities, their physical
abilities and things they can do.

884
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:34,274
LAURA: Oh, but that's different than knowing their
language.

885
00:48:34,274 --> 00:48:35,916
MATT: Yeah. So I don't think you'd pick up a
language.

886
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,597
TRAVIS: Yeah. You get to suck.

887
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:42,640
MARISHA: All right.

888
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,782
MATT: Sorry.

889
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:46,726
TALIESIN: Well, we may have to actually hire a
guide once we're in there, then.

890
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:52,528
LAURA: No, we can't hire anyone! Why can't we just
a hire a tiefling? Don't you have any other

891
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:55,763
tieflings in your tribe?

892
00:48:55,763 --> 00:49:00,047
MARISHA: Maybe, but I imagine they would be
super-rare.

893
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:01,245
LIAM: You've been gone a while.

894
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:02,684
MARISHA: Do we have any?

895
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:04,262
LIAM: Maybe ask dear old Dad.

896
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:15,199
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of-- thank you
for the text. So, he checked on the languages that

897
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,392
Doty knew.

898
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:17,889
LAURA: Aw, that's great.

899
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:27,007
MATT: And Infernal was not one of them, I'm sorry.
So there are two tieflings that exist in this

900
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:33,656
society. They're pretty rare when it comes to
Ashari, just because a lot of tieflings tend to

901
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:37,215
not feel comfortable in some natural elements
sometimes.

902
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:38,502
MARISHA: Sure.

903
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:45,338
MATT: One of them is about six years old. And the
other predominantly works as

904
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:49,579
a gardener in the vicinity.

905
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:53,641
MARISHA: So it's not a guarantee that they know
Infernal, necessarily?

906
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:56,311
MATT: It's not a guarantee, I don't think.

907
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:59,417
TALIESIN: We could go ask.

908
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,506
LAURA: I think we go.

909
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:02,975
MARISHA: I could go ask. I mean, I could go and
get a few buzz-words, you know--

910
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:03,907
LIAM: Let's find that six-year-old.

911
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:06,866
MARISHA: -- hello, goodbye, please, thank you,
left, right.

912
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,150
TALIESIN: No, thank you.

913
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,994
MATT: Actually, most tieflings do learn Infernal
as a language.

914
00:50:10,994 --> 00:50:13,742
MARISHA: What time is it?

915
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:20,416
MATT: You guys have been talking late into the
evening, it's maybe one or two in the morning.

916
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,250
LAURA: So go in the morning, find out. If not,
we'll just go there and hope that

917
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,642
someone speaks Common.

918
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:28,036
TALIESIN: It is called Common for a reason.

919
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:31,154
MARISHA: Yeah, Common. I feel like we'll be okay.

920
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:35,103
LIAM: Well, we can't sit here and wait for him to
come back, we've just gotta fucking do it, right?

921
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:36,606
LAURA: Yeah.

922
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:41,238
MARISHA: Unless-- I could try and talk to Dad,
too, and see if he has anything that might help with

923
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:48,175
languages, but I don't know. I think we'll be
okay. We'll be all right, right?

924
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:49,237
LAURA: It's just hell.

925
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:50,079
MARISHA: It's just hell. It's fine.

926
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,721
LAURA: No big deal. Fine.

927
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:54,248
MARISHA: Okay, so do we have a vague plan? Should
we sleep?

928
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:56,473
TALIESIN: Sleep, talk to the gardener.

929
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,394
LIAM: But if we do this, we're done. We can take
it easy.

930
00:50:59,394 --> 00:51:01,397
LAURA: Ish.

931
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:02,374
TALIESIN: For a bit.

932
00:51:02,374 --> 00:51:08,738
LIAM: To do what? What is left? The dragons are
dead. All that's left is Hotis. What is left?

933
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:16,221
LAURA: The fucking deal that I made with your
fucking goddess. Who knows if she'll call us out

934
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:17,628
on it, but.

935
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:19,193
LIAM: Yeah.

936
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:23,424
LAURA: There's that.

937
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:27,542
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to run right back to the
temple. Are you?

938
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,807
LAURA: Well, hell no. She creeps me out.

939
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:31,954
LIAM: Thank you.

940
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:33,680
LAURA: I saw her face. It's fucking weird.

941
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,708
MARISHA: Yeah, I saw that-- wait, you guys all
saw-- we really talked to--

942
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:38,960
LAURA: Yeah, that happened.

943
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,354
MARISHA: Because that feels like a fever-dream.
That happened, you saw that.

944
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:42,795
LAURA: Did you know we saw her?

945
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,720
MARISHA: Grog, you saw that, right?

946
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,278
LAURA: The giant white mask?

947
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:48,903
MARISHA: The giant white face.

948
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:49,909
TRAVIS: Nope.

949
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,267
LAURA and MARISHA: Grog.

950
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:59,110
LAURA: I feel like Grog's getting more--

951
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,690
MARISHA: Indignant?

952
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,216
LAURA: I feel like you're lying more now than you
used to.

953
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:05,877
TRAVIS: That is not true.

954
00:52:05,877 --> 00:52:11,360
(laughter)

955
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:19,141
LIAM: What do you want to do after this, Grog? Say
we get back from hell. What's the next step for

956
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:26,306
you? I mean, we're going to party, that's a given,
but, like, are you done with the Herd?

957
00:52:26,306 --> 00:52:32,817
TRAVIS: Oh, I dunno, I never look that far ahead.
It keeps disappointment low.

958
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,085
MARISHA: No expectations. I like it.

959
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,660
TRAVIS: Yep.

960
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,089
MARISHA: I mean, it's bad for goals, but yeah.

961
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:42,205
TRAVIS: Goals?

962
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:47,326
MARISHA: High-five, buddy.

963
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:48,188
TRAVIS: Hey!

964
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:49,584
MARISHA: Hey!

965
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:56,103
TRAVIS: (with a mouthful of drink) I don't have
any plans, so I do anything and it normally works

966
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,497
out great.

967
00:52:57,497 --> 00:52:59,977
MARISHA: Word.

968
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:02,305
TALIESIN: There were words in there.

969
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:05,794
LAURA: I actually understood it. How fucked-up is
that?

970
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,419
TRAVIS: You don't need to see all the way to the
horizon, right? You just gotta see right in front

971
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,633
of your own little feet. You'll get there.

972
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:15,006
LIAM: Yeah. You remember that time a sword killed
you?

973
00:53:15,006 --> 00:53:18,280
(laughter)

974
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,207
TRAVIS: Yep.

975
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,971
LIAM: You do, yeah. Doesn't always work out.
Sometimes it gets cocked up, yeah?

976
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:24,906
TRAVIS: Not yet.

977
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:25,845
LIAM: Not yet.

978
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:26,836
TALIESIN: He's got a point.

979
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,415
MARISHA: He does have a point.

980
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:29,721
LAURA: This is true. I mean, we're all here.

981
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:32,497
MARISHA: Has anyone stopped to wonder why we're
all still alive?

982
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:34,227
TALIESIN: All the time.

983
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:44,104
MARISHA: Yeah, by all likelihood we shouldn't be.
That's fun. Good times, good times. What about

984
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,971
you, Vex? What are you doing after we take a
retirement?

985
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:49,762
LAURA: Oh, wow, this is happening.

986
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:51,223
TRAVIS: Percy.

987
00:53:51,223 --> 00:53:54,643
LAURA: (laughs) Good one, Grog. I mean, yeah.

988
00:53:54,643 --> 00:53:57,756
MARISHA: I mean, we knew that.

989
00:53:57,756 --> 00:54:00,649
LAURA: I'm going to hopefully build up my small
house.

990
00:54:00,649 --> 00:54:03,748
TALIESIN: You do have a small house if you're
feeling--

991
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:05,162
LIAM: Has it been built?

992
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,196
LAURA: No, no, it needs to be.

993
00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:08,456
TALIESIN: It needs to be. There's land.

994
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,548
LIAM: 'Twill be.

995
00:54:09,548 --> 00:54:12,039
TALIESIN: Yeah, 'twill be. It's going to be
lovely.

996
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,500
MARISHA: 'Twill be lovely.

997
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,946
TRAVIS: Are you going to be like Mr. Bates on
Downton Abbey afterwards?

998
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:18,637
LAURA: I don't know who that is.

999
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:21,123
MARISHA: Considering your idea of "small".

1000
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:24,290
TALIESIN: It was very nice before it caught fire.

1001
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:29,296
LIAM: This is the sweetest before-we-all-die.

1002
00:54:29,296 --> 00:54:35,442
TALIESIN: This is, and the Grey Hunt itself is
eventually going to be popping up.

1003
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:36,873
LAURA: I would love to know what that is.

1004
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,747
MARISHA: What is the Grey Hunt, Percy? You keep
saying what the Grey Hunt is.

1005
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:39,748
LIAM: Yeah, bust that out.

1006
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:40,497
MARISHA: What is it?

1007
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:41,810
TALIESIN: What's your plans, Kiki?

1008
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,636
LIAM: Whoa, whoa, back it up.

1009
00:54:43,636 --> 00:54:46,047
MARISHA: It's nothing. It's nothing, is what it
is.

1010
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,843
LAURA: I feel like the Grey Hunt is something
really terrible and you just haven't told me.

1011
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,013
TALIESIN: It's not terrible.

1012
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:50,009
LIAM: Bust it out, D-Roll.

1013
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:55,390
TALIESIN: No, no, no, I mean, there's some boring
bits of it, obviously.

1014
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,730
LIAM: Well, tell us the juicy bits of it.

1015
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,676
MARISHA: Yeah.

1016
00:54:57,676 --> 00:55:00,726
TALIESIN: (sighs)

1017
00:55:00,726 --> 00:55:05,721
MARISHA: Is it like paying your taxes, where it's
not a real thing, but you kind of have to do it

1018
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:07,604
because it's on paper, and someone tells you to?

1019
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,283
LAURA: Do I get a jolly hat out of it?

1020
00:55:09,283 --> 00:55:10,582
TALIESIN: Where does she learn this stuff? I've
never--

1021
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:13,663
MARISHA: I learned it from you, Percy!

1022
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,574
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1023
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:17,266
(laughter)

1024
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:18,518
TRAVIS: "I learned it from you!"

1025
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:22,389
(laughter)

1026
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,378
TRAVIS: No guilt.

1027
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:28,433
TALIESIN: Part of the Grey Hunt-- and this happens
not every season, but often on Winter's Crest

1028
00:55:28,433 --> 00:55:32,960
festivals, and again it is an official title and
does actually carry with it some responsibilities

1029
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:39,349
beyond that, but they're very, very you, they'll
be fine-- is, and I can't give too much of it away

1030
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:40,991
because part of the ritual is also--

1031
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:44,231
MARISHA: Oh my god! Tell us something!

1032
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:51,352
TALIESIN: You are going to have to go into the
woods, and meet something.

1033
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:52,696
LIAM: He's making this up as he goes.

1034
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:53,766
TALIESIN: No, I'm really not.

1035
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:54,836
LAURA: Meet something?

1036
00:55:54,836 --> 00:55:58,019
TALIESIN: You go into the woods, there are
creatures that live in the woods that have been

1037
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:05,049
affected by the land, that have gained some--

1038
00:56:05,049 --> 00:56:07,241
TRAVIS: You're going to shroom your tits off.

1039
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:10,275
LAURA: Do I get really high? Is this the whole
point of the Grey Hunt?

1040
00:56:10,275 --> 00:56:14,419
TALIESIN: Whitestone. There are things within the
earth of Whitestone that have certain power and

1041
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:18,798
certain energies, and they have been seeped into
the plants and the stones and the animals

1042
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,594
themselves, and your job will be--

1043
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:24,006
LAURA: Do I have to find the highest animal in the
woods?

1044
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,684
TALIESIN: More or less.

1045
00:56:25,684 --> 00:56:28,797
LIAM: I am starting to regret that I asked. What's
the punchline?

1046
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:32,768
TALIESIN: The punchline is you're going to go and
you're going to have to actually bring back a

1047
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:35,350
kill, and it will be a very specific kill that is
asked for.

1048
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,734
LAURA: Oh, wow.

1049
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:43,118
TALIESIN: But part of that then gives you a
practically divine right to manage and look after

1050
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:49,653
the creatures of the woods, and our hunting, and
what is reasonable to be killed, and otherwise. I

1051
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:51,228
think I'm covering most of it--

1052
00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:54,836
MARISHA: How do you mean divine? Like she can see
things? If she kills the radioactive beast does

1053
00:56:54,836 --> 00:56:57,315
that mean she gets radioactive powers?

1054
00:56:57,315 --> 00:57:01,575
TALIESIN: Divine more in the sense of what
reasonable people do to tell commoners that we're

1055
00:57:01,575 --> 00:57:03,101
allowed to talk to them.

1056
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,380
MARISHA: Oh. That's not as fun.

1057
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,804
TALIESIN: Less exciting.

1058
00:57:05,804 --> 00:57:07,607
LAURA: Do I go alone or do I get help?

1059
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:09,228
TALIESIN: You do go alone. No, you do not get
help.

1060
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:10,534
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1061
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:11,661
MARISHA: That's so cool.

1062
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,773
LIAM: You're so fucking transparent sometimes.

1063
00:57:13,773 --> 00:57:14,738
LAURA: Sounds fun.

1064
00:57:14,738 --> 00:57:16,461
TALIESIN: I think you're going to do very well.

1065
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:18,002
MARISHA: Oh, you'll be fine!

1066
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,178
LAURA: I look forward to it.

1067
00:57:19,178 --> 00:57:22,308
MARISHA: She's killed tree beasts and dragons,
she's fine.

1068
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:23,614
LIAM: Everything under the sun.

1069
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,181
TRAVIS: Tree beasts or three beasts?

1070
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,778
MARISHA: Both!

1071
00:57:26,778 --> 00:57:28,911
LAURA: Look, my light-up 20 just lit up for no
reason as we were talking about it. I think it'll

1072
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:29,717
go very well.

1073
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:31,019
TALIESIN: It's a sign.

1074
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:35,582
It'll be a lovely Winter's Crest. We
haven't had a master or mistress of the Grey Hunt

1075
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:38,138
in many, many, many years.

1076
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:41,631
MARISHA: So, what are you going to do when we take
a break, Percy? You still

1077
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,938
haven't answered the question.

1078
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:49,128
TALIESIN: I don't know. I mean, I think I'm going
home. I say "I think." I'm going home. There will

1079
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:50,572
be work to do there.

1080
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:52,077
LAURA: Don't look at me.

1081
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:59,616
TALIESIN: And I have plans for my city. I have
plans for the people. I want to make it great

1082
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:04,132
again. I want to make it shining, beautiful,
comfortable for everyone.

1083
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:09,625
MARISHA: You know, I might need your help. I have
a few ideas for the Ashari tribes as well.

1084
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,319
TALIESIN: I think that that would be an excellent
thing, for our two people

1085
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,090
to communicate very regularly.

1086
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,231
MARISHA: I think they need to.

1087
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,516
TALIESIN: I think they must.

1088
00:58:17,516 --> 00:58:20,698
MARISHA: Can you help me build some sort of, maybe
like, alarm system?

1089
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:24,437
TALIESIN: That sounds very expensive, I'm not sure
that that's possible. Yes, of course I can help

1090
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:25,561
you with something like that.

1091
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:29,943
MARISHA: Okay! But with taxpayer's money. Also
something else you taught me.

1092
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:32,908
TALIESIN: It will be a string on a bell. You're
learning so well.

1093
00:58:32,908 --> 00:58:34,683
MARISHA: Yeah, just two cups on a string.

1094
00:58:34,683 --> 00:58:35,766
LAURA: Can we go to bed?

1095
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:36,876
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's do that.

1096
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:38,795
(laughter)

1097
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:42,784
TALIESIN: Are we all sleeping in this hut, or do
we have separate huts? We're all sleeping in this

1098
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:44,092
hut, aren't we?

1099
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:45,597
LIAM: Welcome to your yurt.

1100
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:49,652
TRAVIS: Is it all water outside still? Like, a
little bit of water on the ground? No. We're not

1101
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,805
there anymore.

1102
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:52,172
LAURA: It's windy. You're up on a cliff.

1103
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:53,273
MATT: Grog is very drunk at this point.

1104
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:54,462
LIAM: So drunk.

1105
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:55,692
TRAVIS: There's so much water outsi--

1106
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:58,265
(laughter)

1107
00:58:58,265 --> 00:59:04,694
MATT: No, you guys do have separate places to
stay. People clear out in clusters, you have your

1108
00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:06,701
own locations to sleep.

1109
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,462
LIAM: Why does it smell like mayo?

1110
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,221
LAURA: That's gross.

1111
00:59:10,221 --> 00:59:11,492
TRAVIS: Taste of choice.

1112
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:13,590
LIAM: It is mayo! Take that!

1113
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,829
LAURA: He's just been drinking mayo. (laughs)

1114
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:17,758
TRAVIS: Takes a strong constitution.

1115
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:18,715
LIAM: That is vile!

1116
00:59:18,715 --> 00:59:21,512
(laughter)

1117
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:22,814
TALIESIN: That's probably not kept well.

1118
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:25,494
LAURA: That's so gross. All right.

1119
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:26,985
TALIESIN: Goodnight, lovely people.

1120
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:31,304
MATT: You guys rest for the evening. The morning
comes, with your mayo hangover.

1121
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:34,037
(laughter)

1122
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,509
TRAVIS: It's so pure, it never leaves a hangover.

1123
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:37,540
(laughter)

1124
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:45,662
MATT: As morning comes around, you all come to
consciousness. The village of Zephra is already

1125
00:59:45,662 --> 00:59:49,543
come to life. You can see that the townspeople are
up and about, they're handling their business. The

1126
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:56,728
guard's being tended to. You can see the
Windriders are already out, leaping from mountain

1127
00:59:56,728 --> 01:00:03,017
peak to mountain peak, doing their perimeters in
the vicinity. The children are up and being led

1128
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:13,050
to their various outdoor classes. The city is
alive, and your business is your own.

1129
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:20,521
MARISHA: I get information on that gardener and
where to find him. Or them. Or she. Or he. I don't

1130
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:22,763
know who they are.

1131
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:26,195
MATT: Right. It's easy enough to find, in this
city in particular a tiefling sticks out like a

1132
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:33,425
sore thumb. You see a woman, probably in her--
it's hard to tell with a tiefling, demon don't

1133
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:44,392
crack. But she's a little older, she's in her 40s
probably. Dark purple skin, the horns curl

1134
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:47,243
backward and come to almost a singular point
behind--

1135
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,270
LAURA: Oh, cool.

1136
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,199
MATT: And the dark hair shifts in streaks of gray,
but she's in the middle of what looks to be,

1137
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:57,740
gloves on, in the process of checking and planting
more seeds.

1138
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,545
MARISHA: Do I know her name? Did I get a name?

1139
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:01,085
MATT: Yeah. This is Whitney.

1140
01:01:01,085 --> 01:01:01,980
MARISHA: Whitney.

1141
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,892
MATT: Yeah.

1142
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,078
LIAM: I've tagged along, by the way.

1143
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,159
MARISHA: Okay.

1144
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:08,476
MATT: Not her given name, but the name she chose
when she joined the Zephra.

1145
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:12,356
MARISHA: Sure. Okay.

1146
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:16,007
MATT: You've interfaced here and there, nothing
too immediate. You were very young and you were

1147
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:21,073
still-- last you were in the village, being pushed
towards this place of greatness, so a lot of

1148
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:23,272
people didn't interact with you directly too
much.

1149
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:24,134
MARISHA: Sure.

1150
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:25,351
MATT: But you've seen her around.

1151
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:28,388
MARISHA: When we were like kiddies? Oh, no, but
she'd be forever--

1152
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:29,745
MATT: She was older, much older.

1153
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:30,545
MARISHA: Yeah.

1154
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:39,603
MATT: As you approach, she stops and wipes the
dust from her hands, and turns, "Ah! My lady

1155
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:42,899
"Keyleth, I'm sorry." And she stands up and does,
like a small--

1156
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:47,551
MARISHA: Don't do that. The bowing thing is-- I've
always been uncomfortable with it, don't--

1157
01:01:47,551 --> 01:01:48,943
MATT: "I didn't really know what to do--"

1158
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:52,430
MARISHA: No! It's-- No, don't, it's fine. No.
You're fine. You're great! Hi!

1159
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,258
MATT: "Hi."

1160
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,535
MARISHA: Good to see you!

1161
01:01:54,535 --> 01:01:56,259
MATT: "You as well, congratulations."

1162
01:01:56,259 --> 01:02:05,788
MARISHA: Oh, thank you. I was just wondering if I
could actually just ask you a few questions, on

1163
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,142
behalf of everybody.

1164
01:02:07,142 --> 01:02:09,267
MATT: "Certainly, what can I do to help?"

1165
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:16,138
MARISHA: Well, okay. (sighs) I don't know if this
is a sensitive subject or not, I know you've been

1166
01:02:16,138 --> 01:02:25,353
away from this for a little bit, but it seems me
and my team are going to the Nine Hells. To the

1167
01:02:25,353 --> 01:02:35,246
City of Dis. And, yeah. No. I know. We all had the
same reaction. (laughs) I just, I didn't know if

1168
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:44,190
you could actually help me with any Infernal
language or any knowledge that might help, or if

1169
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,656
you still know the language.

1170
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:55,877
MATT: "I've not had to use it in a very long time.
I don't know much about what you're talking about,

1171
01:02:55,877 --> 01:03:07,240
"I've lived here my whole life. I don't
know what else I can offer, as far as-- I can read

1172
01:03:07,298 --> 01:03:13,335
"a little Infernal, and I can understand it if I
hear it, I haven't really had to speak it in a

1173
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,669
"while. What do you need?"

1174
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:22,531
MARISHA: Well, we were thinking of going in under
disguise as, potentially, as tieflings, since they

1175
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:25,070
are more common there.

1176
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:25,982
MATT: "All right."

1177
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:29,208
MARISHA: So I didn't know if you could share any
basics of your language?

1178
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,395
MATT: "What do you want to know?"

1179
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:38,553
MARISHA: Well, you know, hello. Goodbye. Thanks.
Sorry. Left, right.

1180
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:42,773
MATT: "Oh, all right." And she takes a minute and
has to scratch her head, you can see it's been a

1181
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:46,703
long time since she's ever had to exercise her
Infernal-speaking muscles--

1182
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,898
MARISHA: Do you want to do this over breakfast? I
can, we'd be more than

1183
01:03:48,898 --> 01:03:50,005
happy to buy you breakfast.

1184
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:56,593
MATT: "I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm in the
middle of my work here. Okay. For a greeting, I

1185
01:03:56,593 --> 01:04:04,013
"mean as much as there is one. It's pretty abrupt."
And if you're keeping tabs on this, it's

1186
01:04:04,013 --> 01:04:06,848
pronounced "koo-thok".

1187
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:12,808
ALL: Kuthok.

1188
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:17,002
TALIESIN: Kuthok. We're all going to say that over
and over again now. Kuthok.

1189
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:17,740
LIAM: It's like Klingon.

1190
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,766
LAURA: Yeah, it does. It sounds like Klingon.

1191
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:20,957
MARISHA: Okay, cool.

1192
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,174
LAURA: Emphasis on "THOK".

1193
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:23,406
(laughter)

1194
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,377
MARISHA: KuTHOK. You're right.

1195
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:34,732
MATT: "There's, goodbye is very similar.
Kuthrek."

1196
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:36,111
MARISHA: Kuthrek.

1197
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:45,940
MATT: "That is usually said in a very forceful
manner. Goodbyes outside of-- it's usually a very

1198
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,366
"stern separation."

1199
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:49,516
MARISHA: Sure.

1200
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:51,885
MATT: "What else did you--?"

1201
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:57,559
LIAM: Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm Lady Keyleth's...
friend, and--

1202
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,517
MARISHA: (laughs)

1203
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:01,330
LIAM: Aren't I, though?

1204
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,245
MARISHA: No. Sorry. I saw the hesitation and it
was cute. Keep going.

1205
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:13,163
LIAM: All right. We-- You grew up here, so I don't
know if this means anything to you, but we are

1206
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:18,717
searching for a rakshasa. Do you know what that
is?

1207
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:20,383
MATT: "I'm afraid I do not."

1208
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,276
LIAM: No.

1209
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:24,904
MATT: "Look, it's all right. I understand, I--
many people just assume because of the way I look

1210
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:27,958
"that I know a lot about devils and demons."

1211
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,458
MARISHA: No! No, no, no! I--

1212
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,885
MATT: But I really don't. I'm sorry.

1213
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:33,623
LIAM: No, it's all right. Sorry.

1214
01:05:33,623 --> 01:05:34,755
MATT: "It's okay. I just--"

1215
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:37,491
LIAM: Yeah, we're-- we're kind of grasping at
straws so I hope we didn't offend.

1216
01:05:37,491 --> 01:05:43,940
MATT: "No, no offense taken. Just-- I wish I could
be of more help. I'm sorry."

1217
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,163
TRAVIS: (whispers) Insight check.

1218
01:05:45,163 --> 01:05:46,583
MATT: "Any other phrases?"

1219
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,090
LAURA: (whispers) Insight check.

1220
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:50,341
LIAM: (whispers) No.

1221
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:58,324
MARISHA: I mean-- maybe like a 'yes' and a 'no'?
And then we'll totally leave you to your work,

1222
01:05:58,324 --> 01:06:02,363
because I feel like I've totally interrupted,
like, your flow and I'm so sorry.

1223
01:06:02,363 --> 01:06:08,034
MATT: "It's okay. You're allowed to. You're the
Voice of the Tempest, for goodness sake. I--"

1224
01:06:08,034 --> 01:06:11,910
MARISHA: Doesn't excuse me from human decency.
(laughs)

1225
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:19,088
MATT: "Fair enough. 'Yes' is-- 'yes' or an
acknowledgement, is more of a 'yai'."

1226
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:21,472
ALL: Yai.

1227
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:22,590
MARISHA: Yai. Was that right?

1228
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:25,487
LAURA: Episode 91, where we force Matt to make up
an entire language on the spot.

1229
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:26,464
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

1230
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:27,806
MATT: Yeah. Thanks guys.

1231
01:06:27,806 --> 01:06:29,141
TALIESIN: This is so wonderfully Doctor Dolittle.

1232
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:31,071
LAURA: Yai equals yes.

1233
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,031
TRAVIS: Ai.

1234
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:32,935
MARISHA: Yai.

1235
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:35,801
LAURA: Nai. Nern.

1236
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:37,656
(laughter)

1237
01:06:37,656 --> 01:06:39,682
TRAVIS: She's not even waiting for it.

1238
01:06:39,682 --> 01:06:41,406
LIAM: Ermahgerd.

1239
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:42,856
MATT: Sure, that's it now, guys.

1240
01:06:42,856 --> 01:06:43,983
(laughter)

1241
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,365
TALIESIN: No! No! Damn it Liam!

1242
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,830
MARISHA: Fuck! Shut up! Shut up!

1243
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,939
LAURA: No, not 'ermahgerd'!

1244
01:06:47,939 --> 01:06:48,947
MATT: It is now.

1245
01:06:48,947 --> 01:06:50,414
MARISHA: Come on. Come on, really?

1246
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:51,313
LIAM: He's god.

1247
01:06:51,313 --> 01:06:52,199
LAURA: No he is not.

1248
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:53,073
LIAM: Ermahgerd.

1249
01:06:53,073 --> 01:06:54,304
LAURA: Oh. My. God.

1250
01:06:54,304 --> 01:06:56,289
TALIESIN: Ermahgerd. I hate you.

1251
01:06:56,289 --> 01:06:57,401
LAURA: That's canon.

1252
01:06:57,401 --> 01:06:59,217
TALIESIN: It's going in the book.

1253
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:02,494
LIAM: What's that, Mr. Disco? Who do you hate?

1254
01:07:02,494 --> 01:07:06,462
(laughter)

1255
01:07:06,462 --> 01:07:08,342
LAURA: Thanks a lot, Liam!

1256
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:10,083
TALIESIN: You and she of the so-called "Tempest"
can both--

1257
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,211
LIAM: You're welcome.

1258
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:12,491
(laughter)

1259
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:16,759
TRAVIS: Brilliant. You're not going to ask her any
questions? But she's a fuckin' felon on the run

1260
01:07:16,759 --> 01:07:18,905
from the Hells. You're just going to let her go--

1261
01:07:18,905 --> 01:07:23,327
MARISHA: She's not a felon on the run. I've known
her since I was a child.

1262
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:24,554
TRAVIS: No, you're a fool. You're blind.

1263
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:27,030
LAURA: We're not here, so don't worry. We're not
having this conversation in front of her.

1264
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,962
TRAVIS: She's a mass murderer and you let her pick
your vegetables.

1265
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:32,398
MARISHA: She's a peaceful fucking gardener for the
past 20 years.

1266
01:07:32,398 --> 01:07:33,510
TRAVIS: It's a great cover.

1267
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,653
LAURA: For the past 20 years.

1268
01:07:34,653 --> 01:07:38,606
LIAM: Speaking of which, do you know-- what's the
word for peace? Is there a word for peace?

1269
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:39,866
Do you know?

1270
01:07:39,866 --> 01:07:41,512
MATT: "Not that I know of."

1271
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:44,468
LIAM: All right. Shit. This was not very
fruitful.

1272
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:50,057
MARISHA: Mm. It's the Nine Hells. Is there a word
for 'thank you'? Do they thank people there?

1273
01:07:50,057 --> 01:07:51,886
MATT: "It's similar to 'goodbye'."

1274
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:54,269
MARISHA: (laughs) It's similar to goodbye.

1275
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:56,517
LIAM: Is it more or less forceful?

1276
01:07:56,517 --> 01:07:58,700
MATT: "About the same. It can mean both."

1277
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,120
LIAM: Okay.

1278
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,274
MARISHA: Can be both?

1279
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:02,696
LIAM: It's an inflection thing?

1280
01:08:02,696 --> 01:08:09,486
MATT: Well, it's more like 'aloha.' It can be
'hello' or 'goodbye', you know.

1281
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:12,332
LIAM: I feel like we've hassled this woman
enough.

1282
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:13,909
LAURA: You should ask, like, how to say 'Don't
fuck with me.'

1283
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:15,498
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel bad. Whitney.

1284
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:19,021
LIAM: Well that's a bit of a complicated phrase
for someone who barely knows how to say 'hi' and

1285
01:08:19,021 --> 01:08:21,112
'bye.' Woman who's not here.

1286
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:22,026
LAURA: Ermahgerd.

1287
01:08:22,026 --> 01:08:25,616
MARISHA: Thank you so much for us interrupting
your morning. Is there anything you'd like from me

1288
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:27,206
in return?

1289
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:29,657
MATT: "Just leave me to my gardening, if that's
okay."

1290
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:32,743
(laughter)

1291
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:35,926
LIAM: Yeah, we can be annoying sometimes. We
understand.

1292
01:08:35,926 --> 01:08:38,083
TRAVIS: She's got more people to bury.

1293
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:41,429
MARISHA: Great to see you. See you again.

1294
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:42,513
MATT: "You as well."

1295
01:08:42,513 --> 01:08:45,403
MARISHA: Man. So good to be home. Okay, let's go!
Vax?

1296
01:08:45,403 --> 01:08:50,271
MATT: As soon as you start walking away in the
awkward quiet you hear her say over your shoulder,

1297
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:52,391
"Good luck."

1298
01:08:52,391 --> 01:08:55,422
MARISHA: "Thanks." I don't look back out of
embarrassment.

1299
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,382
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

1300
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:59,840
TALIESIN: Ah. Voice of the Tempest.

1301
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,599
MARISHA: Voice of the Tempest, motherfuckers!

1302
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:02,969
LIAM: "Kuthrek."

1303
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:05,019
MARISHA: First act of being king!

1304
01:09:05,019 --> 01:09:06,666
LAURA: Kathrek. Kuthrek.

1305
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:07,654
LIAM: I don't know if I said that right.

1306
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:08,693
LAURA: It's koothrek.

1307
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:09,828
LIAM: I just said tangerine in--

1308
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:15,149
MARISHA: It's Kuthok. Kuthrek. Yai. And
ermahgerd.

1309
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:18,136
MATT: (with accent) Ermahgerd.

1310
01:09:18,136 --> 01:09:19,271
LAURA: What is it?

1311
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:22,948
LIAM: Mordor.

1312
01:09:22,948 --> 01:09:24,692
MATT: Yeah, you got to roll it.

1313
01:09:24,692 --> 01:09:26,618
MARISHA: Rounded vowels.

1314
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:32,653
(laughter)

1315
01:09:32,724 --> 01:09:34,983
MATT: We've all suffered through those
pronunciations.

1316
01:09:35,035 --> 01:09:36,283
LIAM: Inside baseball.

1317
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:38,297
TRAVIS: Make it the last word in a four-sentence
line.

1318
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:39,814
LAURA: No!

1319
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:47,855
MATT: Mordor. Anyway, sorry. Voice-acting
lamenting. So!

1320
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:49,794
MARISHA: Metamucil?

1321
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:52,545
TALIESIN: Mm. Open your portal to the Nine Hells.

1322
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:55,262
MATT: That's a 6th-level spell. So what do you
guys want to do?

1323
01:09:55,262 --> 01:09:56,327
TRAVIS: Regularity.

1324
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:58,385
TALIESIN: I think it's-- are we going to just do
this?

1325
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:01,290
TRAVIS: How did it go? Did you learn everything?

1326
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:05,494
MARISHA: You know, it went about as well as one
could expect?

1327
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:07,981
TRAVIS: I expected it to go pretty fucking well.

1328
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:11,003
LAURA: Did you learn all of the language?

1329
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:15,458
MARISHA: Uh-huh, I totally learned all the
language in one 15-minute setting of annoying a

1330
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,020
poor gardener.

1331
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,742
LAURA: Well, tell us what you learned so that we
can speak it too.

1332
01:10:18,742 --> 01:10:22,481
MARISHA: Okay. Hello, hello-- kuthok.

1333
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:23,833
ALL: Kuthok!

1334
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,246
LAURA: Kuthok. Got it.

1335
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:27,435
MARISHA: Kuthok. Yeah, an emphasis on 'thok'.

1336
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:28,246
LAURA: Got it.

1337
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:29,685
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Goodbye--

1338
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:30,805
LIAM: Is Cusack.

1339
01:10:30,805 --> 01:10:35,997
MARISHA: Close. Close. Kuthrek.

1340
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:37,110
ALL: Kuthrek.

1341
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:38,225
LAURA: Check.

1342
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:39,603
TRAVIS: Oopeck.

1343
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:42,640
MARISHA: Yes: yai.

1344
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,761
ALL: Yai.

1345
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:47,894
LAURA: It's like 'yay', only kind of weird.

1346
01:10:47,894 --> 01:10:50,550
ALL: Yai.

1347
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,058
MATT: So excited for this.

1348
01:10:52,058 --> 01:10:53,644
(laughter)

1349
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:54,621
LIAM: I'm not.

1350
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:55,844
TALIESIN: (whispers) Hate you.

1351
01:10:55,844 --> 01:10:58,228
MARISHA: No-- is ermahgerd.

1352
01:10:58,228 --> 01:11:02,466
ALL: Ermahgerd.

1353
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:09,959
MARISHA: It's impressive that no is the most
complicated one. I know.

1354
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:13,714
TALIESIN: So how do you say, 'Do you speak
Common?'

1355
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:16,364
LAURA: I think probably, 'Do you speak Common?'

1356
01:11:16,364 --> 01:11:17,758
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's fair.

1357
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:19,681
(laughter)

1358
01:11:19,681 --> 01:11:20,994
TRAVIS: That's it? That's all you got?

1359
01:11:20,994 --> 01:11:22,067
TALIESIN: It's remarkable.

1360
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:26,880
MARISHA: She didn't remember a whole lot. She's
been living amongst us for quite a while. In fact,

1361
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,924
she never lived in the Nine Hells, because
apparently that was maybe vaguely offensive?

1362
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:33,078
LAURA: Well, yeah.

1363
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:34,289
TRAVIS: Did you believe her?

1364
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,372
TALIESIN: She kills at night.

1365
01:11:35,372 --> 01:11:39,350
MARISHA: She's n-- yes. I've known her for a
while.

1366
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,016
TRAVIS: What's her last name?

1367
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:42,358
LAURA: What's her mother's name?

1368
01:11:42,358 --> 01:11:43,675
MARISHA: (laughs) What's her mother's name?!

1369
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,210
TALIESIN: No. No, I'm calling that one.

1370
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,183
TRAVIS: She's coming with us though, right?

1371
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:49,346
LAURA: Did you learn how to say 'Leave us alone'?

1372
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:53,233
LIAM: She wasn't very good on phrasing.

1373
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:54,566
MARISHA: Ermahgerd.

1374
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:55,857
LAURA: That works.

1375
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:56,769
LIAM: It was just words.

1376
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:57,697
MARISHA: Just words.

1377
01:11:57,697 --> 01:12:00,426
TALIESIN: Yet I will say, 'yes', 'no', 'please,'
and 'thank you' can get you through an enormous

1378
01:12:00,426 --> 01:12:02,728
amount of transactions with reasonable people.

1379
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,183
MARISHA: Well, we don't have 'please' and 'thank
you' because apparently they--

1380
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:07,709
LAURA: It's the Nine fucking Hells, nobody says
please and thank you.

1381
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:09,157
MARISHA: Yeah, they're not very polite.

1382
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:10,325
TALIESIN: So 'yes' and 'no' get you through an
awful lot.

1383
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:12,806
LIAM: If a horrible devil is bearing down on you
to kill you, you just say 'Ermahgerd, ermahgerd,

1384
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:14,837
ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd, ermahgerd.'

1385
01:12:14,837 --> 01:12:17,108
(laughter)

1386
01:12:17,108 --> 01:12:19,288
MARISHA: It's like the equivalent of the Shia
Leboeuf 'Nanananana!'

1387
01:12:19,288 --> 01:12:20,445
TRAVIS: Nononono!

1388
01:12:20,445 --> 01:12:22,382
MARISHA: Nananana no.

1389
01:12:22,382 --> 01:12:23,850
LAURA: Check! This is great.

1390
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,128
MATT: I am so excited for this.

1391
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:26,529
TALIESIN: We are stalling.

1392
01:12:26,529 --> 01:12:28,894
MARISHA: This is going great. We are totally
stalling.

1393
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:30,514
LAURA: All right, we should probably go.

1394
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:34,421
TRAVIS: How do we feel about kidnapping the
nine-year-old tiefling?

1395
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:39,037
MATT: You hear the tearing of paper behind you as
Taryon takes a sheet from Doty's book and is now,

1396
01:12:39,037 --> 01:12:40,508
"Ermahgerd."

1397
01:12:40,508 --> 01:12:41,868
LAURA: Uh-huh.

1398
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:48,232
MATT: "Er-- (clears throat)--er-- (high pitched
voice)-- ermahgerd. Er-- I'm practicing."

1399
01:12:48,232 --> 01:12:51,843
LIAM: Get it out of your system now, because when
we get over there you should probably keep your

1400
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:52,809
voice down.

1401
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:54,087
LAURA: You've got to be, like, so cool.

1402
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:55,696
You've got to be the coolest.

1403
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:59,548
LIAM: And if that means not talking, that's what
it's got to be, all right?

1404
01:12:59,548 --> 01:13:03,148
TRAVIS: Tary do you remember how dangerous the
kraken was?

1405
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:04,929
MATT: "Yes, but we still prevailed."

1406
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:09,306
TRAVIS: And this is like-- (whispers) what's a big
number?

1407
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:10,699
LIAM: Seven.

1408
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:14,415
TRAVIS: This is, like, seven times more
dangerous.

1409
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:15,695
TALIESIN: Easily.

1410
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:18,153
LIAM: Yeah. Everybody's a kraken there. More or
less.

1411
01:13:18,153 --> 01:13:20,189
TALIESIN: A city of krakens.

1412
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:23,481
MATT: "Well, do we all have to go?"

1413
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:31,111
TRAVIS: Only if you want to become, you know, a
full-fledged, permanent, into-the-histories member

1414
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:32,875
of Vox Machina.

1415
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,539
LIAM: Is that on the table?

1416
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:37,463
MATT: "Then I accept!"

1417
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:38,938
TRAVIS: Mm. Wise choice.

1418
01:13:38,938 --> 01:13:39,849
TALIESIN: It is now.

1419
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:44,078
TRAVIS: A wise choice. It's only like part of it.

1420
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:47,157
TALIESIN: This is assuming that we're going to
survive, to be fair, so--

1421
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:48,346
LAURA: I know, we could all die.

1422
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:51,990
TALIESIN: It's a lot of assumption. Oh, any of us.
Any.

1423
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,036
MATT: "What?"

1424
01:13:53,036 --> 01:13:54,183
TALIESIN: Nothing, it's going to be great.

1425
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:55,998
LAURA: Let's do this. Let's build Dis city.

1426
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,311
TRAVIS: Do you have a will made up?

1427
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:00,531
TALIESIN: How do you even know that-- I-- no,
never mind.

1428
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:03,690
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it, we'll get to that
later.

1429
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,469
LIAM: The multi-verse is large and wide.

1430
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:06,890
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

1431
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,287
MARISHA: Time is a flat circle.

1432
01:14:08,287 --> 01:14:10,218
LAURA: (sings) Let's go to Dis city.

1433
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:11,802
MARISHA: (sings) We built Dis city on rock--

1434
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:13,986
TALIESIN: Nope. Nope.

1435
01:14:13,986 --> 01:14:16,033
TRAVIS: I will shave both of your heads.

1436
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:21,351
TALIESIN: Thank you. Thank you. I'm behind this
plan. It's a good plan.

1437
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:23,353
LIAM: Not in character.

1438
01:14:23,353 --> 01:14:24,874
MARISHA: That was a bad song.

1439
01:14:24,874 --> 01:14:26,481
TRAVIS: (electric razor noise)

1440
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:28,728
MARISHA: All right. Are we going?

1441
01:14:28,728 --> 01:14:29,761
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1442
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,049
MARISHA: Are we going? Are we ready?

1443
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,724
LAURA: I mean, I was kind of joking, but sure.
Let's go.

1444
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:33,970
MARISHA: All right.

1445
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,144
LAURA: What is this? What is this creepy, weird--

1446
01:14:35,144 --> 01:14:35,968
LIAM: Who Dis?

1447
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:37,050
LAURA: Who Dis? Who dat?

1448
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,480
MARISHA: Who Dis? We gotta hold hands and then--

1449
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,880
TALIESIN: Wait are you above me or below me?

1450
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,794
TRAVIS: I'm above you.

1451
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:42,108
TALIESIN: All right.

1452
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:45,994
MARISHA: Good job. Bamf, City of Dis.

1453
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:51,988
MATT: As you all hold hands, and you complete the
ritual, the incantations leaving your lips, your

1454
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:56,519
vision suddenly grows dark as the magics of the
spell pluck you from your home plane and thrust

1455
01:14:56,519 --> 01:14:59,090
you into the space between.

1456
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,919
LAURA: Oh god.

1457
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:09,345
MATT: Before you, a glow begins as you rocket
towards an unexpected and incredible sight: an

1458
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:18,934
endless permeable tapestry, a tangled lattice of
burning, divine fire appears before you, writhing

1459
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:25,697
and growing as you shoot towards it with
incredible speed. You instinctively wince and

1460
01:15:25,697 --> 01:15:33,993
curl, a promise of impact triggering your need to
defend yourself, the dread as the air begins to

1461
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:44,212
heat around you. Then-- whoom-- you impact and
pass through harmlessly, the heat fading. You

1462
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:50,261
glance over your shoulder to see it gone. You just
passed through the Divine Gate.

1463
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:52,257
TRAVIS: The Divine Gate.

1464
01:15:52,257 --> 01:16:00,021
MATT: You glance over your shoulder to see it
vanish, but then another flash of red magical

1465
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:07,164
power consumes your vision as your feet suddenly
find hard ground. As the rush of powerful energies

1466
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:13,454
subside, the swirl of color and sudden thrust of
movement coming to an abrupt halt, you find

1467
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:19,589
yourself standing within an extremely dark
alleyway of some kind, framed by the exterior of

1468
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:26,123
dark stone buildings, climbing up above you for
many, many stories. The cracked, thick

1469
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:32,916
cobblestones that mark the floor are littered with
filth, slivers of cracked skulls and bones, as

1470
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:40,648
well as discarded refuse of some indeterminate
origin. The air here is extremely hot, the walls

1471
01:16:40,648 --> 01:16:49,034
and floors themselves around you seemingly the
source. As you look, you glance out past both sides

1472
01:16:49,034 --> 01:16:56,036
of this alleyway you've somehow arrived in, and the
air distorts with intense heat as smoke rises from

1473
01:16:56,097 --> 01:17:02,586
the streets themselves around you, the occasional
ash or ember drifting through the air in front.

1474
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:08,690
Now, the dense city that surrounds you is
incredibly massive; the walls, the structures that

1475
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:16,463
clutter the immense black metropolis surrounding
you glow at the edges like heated glass. As you

1476
01:17:16,463 --> 01:17:23,161
peek past and look further out, you can see the
city is a broken maze of metal ramparts built into

1477
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:27,386
miles of steep hillsides and shattered towers
framing an endless labyrinth of twisting

1478
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:35,184
alleyways. Within these streets, your eyes dart
around to see dozens of molten, slithering masses

1479
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:44,934
of flesh shifting past the mouth of the alleyway,
roiling, stepping with sick slapping sound, their

1480
01:17:44,934 --> 01:17:50,321
faces twisted into a grotesque look of
ever-retching horror, the sound escaping like a

1481
01:17:50,321 --> 01:18:00,715
(gasps in pain) wince with an underlying screech
and scream. You see behind them, cracking lashes

1482
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:09,463
over these masses of flesh, two large humanoid
devils with spine-like protrusions that come

1483
01:18:09,463 --> 01:18:16,642
jutting out of the sides of ash-white skin pulled
tight against a massive skeletal form, the backs

1484
01:18:16,642 --> 01:18:21,273
of their bodies forming these gargantuan
scorpion-like tails that dangle, looming

1485
01:18:21,273 --> 01:18:27,702
dangerously in front of them. As they step forward
(whip sounds), two more lashes go, you see these

1486
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:34,896
fleshy masses (gasps) begin to clutter up again
and move further past the exit to the alley as

1487
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:45,884
these bone devil-like creatures slowly crawl past.
One of them stops for a second and continues

1488
01:18:45,884 --> 01:18:53,365
walking as you all hold your breath. A sudden,
horrid stench of decay fills the air as they pass.

1489
01:18:53,365 --> 01:19:00,573
You hear them crackling in the distance as they
shove along their tortured charges. As you glance

1490
01:19:00,573 --> 01:19:09,407
up past them, you see the sky now: dozens of
winged shadows glide through the air across a

1491
01:19:09,407 --> 01:19:18,066
greenish, cloudy, barely lit sky that flashes with
far distant cracks of lightning, occasionally

1492
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:24,586
brightening darker shapes, larger, looming in the
distance. But one that draws your eye like a

1493
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:32,334
terrible dream, unable to look away upon noticing
it, is an impossibly colossal tower of black iron

1494
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:40,269
and lead, stretching for hundreds of miles into
the sky before vanishing into the dark, clouded

1495
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:50,745
expanse above you. You blink and turn around to
look at the other side of the horizon, but there

1496
01:19:50,745 --> 01:20:00,609
stands the exact same tower. You shift around; no
matter your view of that horrid horizon, there

1497
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:07,924
stands the Iron Tower, the throne of the
archdevil, Dispater, standing ever-vigilant over

1498
01:20:07,924 --> 01:20:13,454
his Iron City of Dis. And that's where we're going
to take a break.

1499
01:20:13,454 --> 01:20:17,099
MARISHA: Good, I have to pee so bad!

1500
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:20,037
LAURA: Wait, I have a question! We did a Heroes'
Feast last night, right?

1501
01:20:20,037 --> 01:20:20,898
MATT: Nope!

1502
01:20:20,898 --> 01:20:21,949
MARISHA: Nope, we didn't!

1503
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,690
LAURA: I thought we said we were going to do it! I
thought we were going to do it!

1504
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:26,231
MATT: You gotta say you're going to do it.
Nobody said it.

1505
01:20:26,412 --> 01:20:28,744
LAURA: Didn't we say we were going to do it?!

1506
01:20:28,744 --> 01:20:30,867
LIAM: Might have said it last game, but I don't
remember it this game.

1507
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,017
TRAVIS: We didn't say it.

1508
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:33,601
LAURA: I thought we said it in the last game.

1509
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,408
LIAM: No, but then you have to follow through--

1510
01:20:35,408 --> 01:20:37,659
LAURA: Shit balls mother bitch fuck balls!

1511
01:20:37,659 --> 01:20:39,659
TALIESIN: It's okay, we're going to find an inn.

1512
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:45,070
MATT: We're going to take a break here, guys, real
fast. For the chat room, we're giving away this

1513
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:46,985
really awesome Wyrmwood.

1514
01:20:46,985 --> 01:20:48,806
LAURA: Ah, that's some of my favorite wood right
there!

1515
01:20:48,806 --> 01:20:55,364
MATT: It is the black and white ebony tabletop
dice tray. It's fantastic. The word to use in the

1516
01:20:55,364 --> 01:20:59,858
Twitch chat-- if you're in Alpha, move over to
Twitch chat to make sure you put this in there to

1517
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:04,644
be part of this giveaway-- the word of the night
is 'Doty', D-O-T-Y.

1518
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:06,441
LAURA: It should be 'ermahgerd,' but whatever.

1519
01:21:06,441 --> 01:21:07,905
MATT: They've already established it. Next
episode.

1520
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:08,888
LIAM: Too bad, so sad.

1521
01:21:08,888 --> 01:21:13,051
MATT: Back here in a few minutes, and we'll pick
up where we left off. See you guys shortly.

1522
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:14,791
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

1523
01:21:14,791 --> 01:37:33,836
[break]

1524
01:37:33,895 --> 01:37:39,135
MATT: Welcome back. So, first, before it begins,
our winner of the chatroom who's going to win the

1525
01:37:39,135 --> 01:37:44,610
awesome dice box from Wyrmwood is Thaign,
T-H-A-I-G-N.

1526
01:37:44,777 --> 01:37:45,500
TALIESIN: Thaign.

1527
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,783
(cheering)

1528
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:49,831
MATT: So congratulations, we'll get your
information and get that sent to you, well done.

1529
01:37:49,831 --> 01:37:50,946
LAURA: Fight!

1530
01:37:50,946 --> 01:37:52,512
TRAVIS: The box is really sweet, We just saw it.

1531
01:37:52,512 --> 01:37:53,483
LAURA: Yeah, we did.

1532
01:37:53,483 --> 01:38:01,703
MATT: All right, so, as you guys have just taken
in as much of the scenery as you can here within

1533
01:38:01,703 --> 01:38:08,101
someplace in an alley in the center of the City of
Dis. Where no matter where you look, the creepy

1534
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:11,515
distant tower of iron seems to follow--

1535
01:38:11,515 --> 01:38:12,990
LAURA: (whispers) Dis tower.

1536
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:17,511
MATT: -- your vision no matter where on the
horizon you glance. Ever watching, ever present.

1537
01:38:17,511 --> 01:38:18,823
TRAVIS: That's weird.

1538
01:38:18,823 --> 01:38:20,843
MATT: What do you want to do?

1539
01:38:20,843 --> 01:38:22,441
TRAVIS: Send up a flare.

1540
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:24,448
TALIESIN: While we can do that--

1541
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:27,760
LAURA: Let's put our hoods and cloaks on. Weren't
you going to make yourself look like a tiefling?

1542
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,811
MARISHA: I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do
it right now. Is anyone watching?

1543
01:38:31,811 --> 01:38:34,782
LAURA: Can I see if anybody is watching right
now?

1544
01:38:34,782 --> 01:38:37,239
TALIESIN: There's an omnipresent iron tower that's
watching.

1545
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:39,461
LAURA: Is there a-- I mean, iron tower?

1546
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:42,933
TALIESIN: It's more the 'omnipresent' part that
was really the point of that, but yes.

1547
01:38:42,933 --> 01:38:46,282
LAURA: I thought you said an eye on a tower, and I
was like, that's a different tower.

1548
01:38:46,282 --> 01:38:47,400
MATT: That's a different tower.

1549
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,798
TALIESIN: That's copyrighted, I'm well aware.

1550
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:52,463
MARISHA: Percy's got a good point. We might want
to try and get out of the street.

1551
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:54,289
Get indoors. Yeah.

1552
01:38:54,289 --> 01:39:02,753
LAURA: Can I perceive anywhere that looks like
where travelers would stay?

1553
01:39:02,753 --> 01:39:05,668
MATT: Make a perception check.

1554
01:39:05,668 --> 01:39:07,298
LIAM: I'll do the same.

1555
01:39:07,298 --> 01:39:11,492
LAURA: 30.

1556
01:39:11,492 --> 01:39:13,574
LIAM: That's better than me. 24.

1557
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:25,458
MATT: Okay. As you come up to the edge and lean
against the wall, looking over the side. First, a

1558
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:30,754
moment passes, and as your shoulder hits the wall,
you smell something burning as you glance back.

1559
01:39:30,754 --> 01:39:35,167
Suddenly your shoulder, you can see the heat of
the actual wall with just a brief contact to your

1560
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:38,373
body has begun to burn--

1561
01:39:38,373 --> 01:39:39,290
TRAVIS: What?

1562
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:41,443
MATT: -- and singe the outside of your cloak.

1563
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:42,370
LAURA: Oh crap!

1564
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,562
LIAM: Pat your hair, pat your hair, pat your hair,
pat your hair.

1565
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:44,621
LAURA: Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1566
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:45,782
MARISHA: Wait, from just peeking around the
corner?

1567
01:39:45,782 --> 01:39:47,525
MATT: From just leaning and touching the wall.

1568
01:39:47,525 --> 01:39:48,719
TRAVIS: (groans) Ugh, it's Tucson.

1569
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:56,535
MATT: You immediately notice that the bottom
elements of your shoes are melting a little bit on

1570
01:39:56,535 --> 01:39:58,035
the bottom with your steps.

1571
01:39:58,035 --> 01:40:00,697
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Good thing rubber doesn't exist
here.

1572
01:40:00,697 --> 01:40:08,239
MATT: The city itself is just this emanating
source of perpetual heat. You're already sweating

1573
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:12,821
in the presence here, and as you glance around the
corner and look at these buildings that rise up,

1574
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:20,036
you can see the architecture is hooked to the
corner as the monolithic deep reds and blacks and

1575
01:40:20,036 --> 01:40:27,322
grays that everything's built from, nothing belies
an exterior that would seem to be welcoming to a

1576
01:40:27,322 --> 01:40:30,876
traveling pack of people, at least not from your
current standpoint.

1577
01:40:30,876 --> 01:40:36,244
LIAM: And remind us, it's dim or it's not super
bright here, is it? Dark?

1578
01:40:36,244 --> 01:40:44,362
MATT: No. It's not super dark either. Imagine a
very very very very cloudy day around sunset.

1579
01:40:44,362 --> 01:40:50,441
LAURA: Well. I don't know what to do other than
to-- Does it look like there's anybody around us

1580
01:40:50,441 --> 01:40:52,599
that can see us? Anybody watching?

1581
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:55,936
MATT: (laughs) Are you trying to be stealthy?

1582
01:40:55,936 --> 01:41:00,624
LAURA: I mean, I'm glancing subtly, trying to look
like a badass but also stealthy.

1583
01:41:00,624 --> 01:41:03,565
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1584
01:41:05,356 --> 01:41:07,549
LAURA: 18.

1585
01:41:07,549 --> 01:41:24,780
MATT: Okay. As you glance out to the side, you
watch as two, what look to be humanoid,

1586
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:34,249
normal-sized humans, but deep red skin, black
hair, horns curled at the front of the forehead

1587
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:40,960
and folded leathery wings at their sides, begin
stepping off from one of the nearby roads that

1588
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,645
seems to go further into the city, and they walk
past and one of them glances over and sees you.

1589
01:41:46,645 --> 01:41:52,012
And they both just keep walking, seemingly not
affected or alerted by your presence.

1590
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:53,511
LAURA: Okay.

1591
01:41:53,511 --> 01:42:02,341
MATT: Looking about each side of the road as you
go, there is a lot of movement through these

1592
01:42:02,341 --> 01:42:09,181
streets, there are a lot of creatures, all sorts
of weird shapes, you see a lot of that weird

1593
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:14,867
fleshy mass that you saw stepping forward, there's
clusters of them all over. Many of them seem to be

1594
01:42:14,867 --> 01:42:22,710
herded or pushed, some seem to be almost chained
together in places and being dragged around.

1595
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:30,887
LAURA: Is it like that thing we ran into in-- Was it
Kraghammer? Where were we where that thing was

1596
01:42:31,008 --> 01:42:33,007
like a mash of bones and stuff?

1597
01:42:33,007 --> 01:42:34,664
LIAM: Oh, in the field of bone shards.

1598
01:42:34,664 --> 01:42:35,597
MATT: Oh, right, right!

1599
01:42:35,597 --> 01:42:36,523
LAURA: Is it like that?

1600
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:48,988
MATT: No, imagine a very, very rotund person that
is perpetually melting out of clay, and-- let me

1601
01:42:48,988 --> 01:42:50,414
just show you a picture, actually.

1602
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:53,669
TRAVIS: Is it like a fondue pot of nine people in
one?

1603
01:42:53,669 --> 01:42:55,444
MATT: There's a single face.

1604
01:42:55,444 --> 01:42:56,792
LAURA: Okay.

1605
01:42:56,792 --> 01:42:58,990
LIAM: It's like a walking shit sack, yeah?

1606
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,490
MATT: Kind of.

1607
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,434
TALIESIN: Pizza the Hutt.

1608
01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:03,874
LIAM: Yeah.

1609
01:43:03,874 --> 01:43:04,968
MATT: That right there.

1610
01:43:04,968 --> 01:43:07,241
LAURA: Ew! You can't even see legs!

1611
01:43:07,241 --> 01:43:13,716
MATT: It's just these, like a liquified person
that is just a somewhat-shifting, burbling forth

1612
01:43:13,716 --> 01:43:20,264
fleshy sack that occasionally-- you can see like
the mouth and what looks almost like a face that

1613
01:43:20,264 --> 01:43:23,277
is ever-screaming and writhing in pain.

1614
01:43:23,277 --> 01:43:24,509
LAURA: That seems awful.

1615
01:43:24,509 --> 01:43:25,816
TRAVIS: This guy needs some calcium.

1616
01:43:25,816 --> 01:43:28,357
LAURA: Wait, imma put my glasses on so I can see
it again! Oh, you already closed it.

1617
01:43:28,357 --> 01:43:33,685
MATT: I can bring it back up again, it's all
right.

1618
01:43:33,685 --> 01:43:35,686
TRAVIS: Right next to that beautiful picture of
a--

1619
01:43:35,686 --> 01:43:37,123
MATT: Oh, yeah! Well, you've already seen the
other creatures before.

1620
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:38,531
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1621
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:40,117
MATT: But that's your fun one there.

1622
01:43:40,117 --> 01:43:42,907
LAURA: That is so creepy. Okay.

1623
01:43:42,907 --> 01:43:51,687
MATT: But they're being herded around. You see
smaller creatures, you see imps, which you've

1624
01:43:51,687 --> 01:44:00,134
encountered before: tiny winged leathery humanoid
creatures that flutter around and seem to be more

1625
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:05,430
keeping a peripheral view, an overhead view of the
goings-on of each one of these clusters of

1626
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:13,472
entities being pulled through the city. You see a
handful attending each of these that move along,

1627
01:44:13,534 --> 01:44:21,404
these humanoid devils that have long polearms, and
from their dark, almost like bluish-purple skin,

1628
01:44:21,404 --> 01:44:28,368
what looks to be almost like a series of jagged
pointed tendrils that jut from the bottom of their

1629
01:44:28,368 --> 01:44:34,646
chin and almost like writhe and curl as they push
forward, occasionally shoving their weapon into

1630
01:44:34,646 --> 01:44:39,914
the side of these things and just getting them
back on track as they wander off.

1631
01:44:39,914 --> 01:44:45,319
LAURA: Do I see anything that looks like normal
Exandrians? People that are just like--

1632
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:51,475
MATT: At the very-- at this moment, no. And you
get the sense that, at least, they're not super

1633
01:44:51,475 --> 01:44:54,944
common. (laughs) Almost everyone that is currently
walking through the street in this particular

1634
01:44:54,944 --> 01:45:01,099
intersection seems to be of some sort of devilish
heritage.

1635
01:45:01,099 --> 01:45:09,911
LAURA: Right. I go back to our group and say,
well, I was spotted for sure. Nobody seemed to pay

1636
01:45:09,911 --> 01:45:15,539
me very much mind, but there's nobody here that
looks like us. I don't know if we've happened to

1637
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:21,040
pop into a particular area of the city that is
inhabited mostly by devils,

1638
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,589
but that's where we are.

1639
01:45:23,589 --> 01:45:27,347
TRAVIS: Do we know what layer we're in?

1640
01:45:27,347 --> 01:45:28,821
TALIESIN: Dis would be--

1641
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:31,875
MARISHA: What layer of Hell? It's like, the third,
fourth? Second.

1642
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:33,631
LIAM: Dis is two.

1643
01:45:33,631 --> 01:45:35,540
TRAVIS: Oh, we gotta find the--

1644
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,075
LIAM: What level Dis?

1645
01:45:37,075 --> 01:45:39,132
TRAVIS: Open market, right?

1646
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:42,073
LAURA: Yes, the market.

1647
01:45:42,073 --> 01:45:43,756
TRAVIS: Yep.

1648
01:45:43,756 --> 01:45:45,008
LAURA: Oh, right.

1649
01:45:45,008 --> 01:45:46,102
MARISHA: What?

1650
01:45:46,102 --> 01:45:49,150
TALIESIN: If we find the market, we'll find an
inn. Find an inn, we'll find a place to drink and

1651
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:50,280
get a room.

1652
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:53,895
TRAVIS: Please don't make me be the one that
remembered all the shit about Dis. I mean, I am

1653
01:45:53,895 --> 01:45:56,691
The Grand Poobah de Doink of All of Dis and That,
so.

1654
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:59,387
LAURA: Oh, that's true, you would know!

1655
01:45:59,387 --> 01:46:02,452
TRAVIS: Y'all motherfuckers is coming with me.

1656
01:46:02,452 --> 01:46:05,048
TALIESIN: Oh no, I can already see that going
poorly.

1657
01:46:05,048 --> 01:46:08,696
LAURA: I feel like we should put our hoods up and
just generally act like we belong here.

1658
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,288
LIAM: Just walk with purpose.

1659
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:14,982
MARISHA: Do you think if I do an Alter Self here
that people will notice?

1660
01:46:14,982 --> 01:46:16,290
LAURA: Can you do it quickly? I mean--

1661
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:17,427
MARISHA: Yeah, I can do it at will.

1662
01:46:17,427 --> 01:46:19,180
LAURA: We're in an alleyway.

1663
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,641
TALIESIN: All right, let's all make the changing
circle.

1664
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:25,096
MARISHA: Yeah, just shield me, like we're changing
at the beach.

1665
01:46:25,096 --> 01:46:28,099
LAURA: Can you just lean in front of Keyleth?

1666
01:46:28,099 --> 01:46:31,147
MARISHA: Look casual. Don't touch the wall, you'll
burn!

1667
01:46:31,147 --> 01:46:32,256
TRAVIS: Ahh!

1668
01:46:32,256 --> 01:46:37,055
MATT: Which actually, you do immediately take four
points of fire damage as you do so.

1669
01:46:37,055 --> 01:46:40,155
LIAM: Aww, poor baby.

1670
01:46:40,155 --> 01:46:41,219
MARISHA: Aww, buddy!

1671
01:46:41,219 --> 01:46:42,577
LAURA: Put some mayonnaise on it, you'll feel
better.

1672
01:46:42,577 --> 01:46:43,590
MARISHA: Yeah, it's true.

1673
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:46,870
TRAVIS: Mayonnaise (squelching noise).

1674
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:49,420
MATT: So, are you changing your appearance?

1675
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:50,750
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to--

1676
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:55,714
LAURA: Can you imagine how sour Grog must smell
all the time? He just has mayonnaise on him.

1677
01:46:55,714 --> 01:46:58,695
LIAM: Curdled dairy at all times.

1678
01:46:58,695 --> 01:47:04,484
TRAVIS: Or how much I love it? Sam said he can
cast Alter Self on himself plus three others.

1679
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:05,982
MATT: Yes, I'm working on that.

1680
01:47:05,982 --> 01:47:06,907
TRAVIS: Okay.

1681
01:47:06,907 --> 01:47:08,618
MARISHA: Oh, he can do it on others?

1682
01:47:08,618 --> 01:47:11,923
MATT: Yeah, people who can actually cast the
spell, they can cast on other people, but you as a

1683
01:47:11,923 --> 01:47:14,061
druid ability, you can only do it right on
yourself.

1684
01:47:14,061 --> 01:47:22,531
MARISHA: Oh, copy. Cool. I'm going to look like
kind of a vague cross between Whitney and Zahra.

1685
01:47:22,531 --> 01:47:28,070
MATT: Okay, and as you do that, Taryon immediately
goes, "Oh, great idea!" and he turns himself

1686
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:34,492
into-- he pulls out a small object and clicks it
for a second, as it does, his form shifts into an

1687
01:47:34,492 --> 01:47:36,862
almost identical-looking--

1688
01:47:36,862 --> 01:47:38,414
TRAVIS: Female?

1689
01:47:38,414 --> 01:47:43,694
MATT: (laughs) No, a male tiefling. And then goes,
"Who else, who else? Who else would like my blessing?"

1690
01:47:43,694 --> 01:47:51,015
MARISHA: You know? Hold off on that. I'm not
saying it's not a good idea, but maybe we should

1691
01:47:51,015 --> 01:47:54,723
workshop it. What--

1692
01:47:54,723 --> 01:47:56,382
LAURA: I want to be one.

1693
01:47:56,382 --> 01:47:59,949
MATT: "I knew you would!" And he comes forward and
pulls another one out and as he breaks this small

1694
01:47:59,949 --> 01:48:04,034
capsule in your direction, this burst of arcane
energy hits you and all of a sudden, your form

1695
01:48:04,034 --> 01:48:07,129
shifts into an almost identical-looking tiefling;
same colors--

1696
01:48:07,129 --> 01:48:10,216
LAURA: No, change it up-- stop, Taryon!

1697
01:48:10,216 --> 01:48:15,668
MATT: "I wh-- okay! Ah!" and he tries to finagle
with it for the last second as the spell just

1698
01:48:15,668 --> 01:48:21,334
about takes hold of your shape goes slightly more,
and he goes, "Uh, blue?" and you're a little more

1699
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:24,580
blue. It's the tail-end, like the "Eh?"

1700
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:26,560
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, we don't want to be--

1701
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,508
LIAM: No, I'm talking it out. You can do that to
how many more of us?

1702
01:48:29,508 --> 01:48:30,564
LAURA: Two more people.

1703
01:48:30,564 --> 01:48:32,325
MATT: "Two more!"

1704
01:48:32,325 --> 01:48:34,859
LAURA: (laughs) Kidding, he knew.

1705
01:48:34,859 --> 01:48:38,102
TALIESIN: I'll take one, why not?

1706
01:48:38,102 --> 01:48:42,074
LAURA: Yeah, Grog can look like Grog.

1707
01:48:42,074 --> 01:48:46,370
LIAM: I feel like a handful of tieflings and Grog
is better than us as we are.

1708
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:48,002
TALIESIN: I would agree.

1709
01:48:48,002 --> 01:48:49,969
MATT: He goes ahead and takes one--

1710
01:48:49,969 --> 01:48:53,400
LAURA: But make him more red. Pink!

1711
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,372
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, how long does Alter
Self last when it's just a spell? Because if we

1712
01:48:57,372 --> 01:49:05,883
were going to try and eat some food, and take a
break, then maybe we should do that first? Are we

1713
01:49:05,883 --> 01:49:09,020
still doing that, or are we just going head-on
into this? Feel like

1714
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:10,511
our plan's already dissolving.

1715
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:12,778
LAURA: No no, we need to get a-- we need to eat.

1716
01:49:12,778 --> 01:49:13,952
LIAM: Yeah, we're in a back alley.

1717
01:49:13,952 --> 01:49:15,156
TRAVIS: Heroes' Feast.

1718
01:49:15,156 --> 01:49:16,872
LIAM: We gotta walk through this town.

1719
01:49:16,872 --> 01:49:18,494
MARISHA: I can find it too, Matt.

1720
01:49:18,494 --> 01:49:20,412
MATT: I'm looking it up, hold on.

1721
01:49:20,412 --> 01:49:23,246
MARISHA: Alter Self lasts for one hour.

1722
01:49:23,246 --> 01:49:24,548
MATT: Correct, concentration though, right?

1723
01:49:24,548 --> 01:49:26,892
LAURA: Okay, well that'd-- concentration?

1724
01:49:26,892 --> 01:49:28,561
MATT: Yeah, and so--

1725
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:32,249
TALIESIN: If we go into a fight, it doesn't
matter. I'll take grey.

1726
01:49:32,305 --> 01:49:37,533
MATT: "Well, by all means!" and he hands you the
small capsule-- It's almost like he enchants the

1727
01:49:37,533 --> 01:49:42,105
coins, you're actually casting the spells on
yourself, so you are concentrating on the spell.

1728
01:49:42,105 --> 01:49:48,048
MARISHA: Okay, so I guess we will get through this
city and eat a Heroes' Feast when we get to our

1729
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:49,373
destination?

1730
01:49:49,373 --> 01:49:52,697
LAURA: Yeah, and then we'll just Alter Self
again.

1731
01:49:52,697 --> 01:49:54,184
LIAM: So I can do this on my own then?

1732
01:49:54,184 --> 01:49:55,849
MATT: "Yeah, by all means."

1733
01:49:55,849 --> 01:49:57,579
LIAM: Fuck it, all white.

1734
01:49:57,579 --> 01:49:58,788
LAURA: White?

1735
01:49:58,788 --> 01:50:00,150
MATT: You become an albino--

1736
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:01,543
TRAVIS: Whoa!

1737
01:50:01,543 --> 01:50:03,151
MATT: -- tiefling of your own intrinsic design.

1738
01:50:03,151 --> 01:50:04,672
LAURA: Way to totally blend in.

1739
01:50:04,672 --> 01:50:05,638
TRAVIS: Cool!

1740
01:50:05,638 --> 01:50:06,934
MARISHA: Very, very unique.

1741
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:07,927
LAURA: Good job, rogue.

1742
01:50:07,927 --> 01:50:11,221
LIAM: Do you think everybody here dresses like the
Raven Queen's butler? I mean--

1743
01:50:11,221 --> 01:50:13,058
MATT: You have encountered an albino tiefling
before.

1744
01:50:13,058 --> 01:50:13,941
TALIESIN: We have.

1745
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,040
MARISHA: Have we?

1746
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,113
LIAM: Smartypants.

1747
01:50:16,113 --> 01:50:17,107
TALIESIN: Lillith.

1748
01:50:17,107 --> 01:50:18,335
LAURA: Lillith was an albino?

1749
01:50:18,335 --> 01:50:19,372
MARISHA: Lillith.

1750
01:50:19,372 --> 01:50:20,590
LAURA: That's why she was so pale.

1751
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,809
MARISHA: She was so cute!

1752
01:50:21,809 --> 01:50:23,340
LIAM: You can say you're sorry.

1753
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:24,195
LAURA: I'm not.

1754
01:50:24,195 --> 01:50:25,446
LIAM: You're not? You should be.

1755
01:50:25,446 --> 01:50:26,962
LAURA: I'm not!

1756
01:50:26,962 --> 01:50:27,960
LIAM: You're wrong, though.

1757
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,651
TALIESIN: Right! Let's find ourselves a
marketplace and an inn!

1758
01:50:30,651 --> 01:50:32,581
MARISHA: And a rakshasa.

1759
01:50:32,581 --> 01:50:40,605
TALIESIN: Let's go. I am going to step out into
the street.

1760
01:50:40,605 --> 01:50:42,530
LAURA: Act like you belong here. Act tough
and cool.

1761
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:44,212
TALIESIN: With pomp and circumstance and purpose.

1762
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,987
MARISHA: I join Percy.

1763
01:50:45,987 --> 01:50:48,575
TALIESIN: Please don't write things down while I
do that.

1764
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:49,511
LAURA: Oh no!

1765
01:50:49,511 --> 01:50:50,572
TALIESIN: That's not nice!

1766
01:50:50,572 --> 01:50:51,529
LAURA: Act like you belong.

1767
01:50:51,529 --> 01:50:52,602
MATT: Why, whatever do you mean?

1768
01:50:52,602 --> 01:50:56,716
LAURA: People will buy it. We just walk looking
straight ahead; don't look around too much.

1769
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:57,969
MARISHA: Yep yep!

1770
01:50:57,969 --> 01:51:01,040
LIAM: 10% what you say, 90% how you say it.

1771
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,190
TALIESIN: I act like me, I think I'm going to be
fine.

1772
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:05,213
LIAM: I act like Percy.

1773
01:51:05,213 --> 01:51:07,495
TALIESIN: He's also going to be fine.

1774
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:15,879
MATT: As you guys step out into the main road, you
can see the cracked stones that make up the

1775
01:51:15,879 --> 01:51:27,053
walkway here. Even just walking through here,
though you feel confident in your placement, the

1776
01:51:27,053 --> 01:51:33,270
presence here you're still getting used to, and
it's something about the air, or you feel just a

1777
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:38,424
little dizzy as you're still adjusting to the
heat, to the placement, to the strange

1778
01:51:38,424 --> 01:51:48,402
ever-so-faintly non-Euclidian structure to the
landscape around you. It's forcing you to

1779
01:51:48,402 --> 01:51:54,047
consciously right your posture and pay more
attention to your surroundings than you normally

1780
01:51:54,047 --> 01:52:04,758
would. There's just something about the presence
here that's unwelcoming. You can see there are a

1781
01:52:04,758 --> 01:52:09,695
number of other streets that head in any
direction. It's hard to tell which way is further

1782
01:52:09,695 --> 01:52:15,578
into the city and which is further out, it's so
vast. Even the City of Brass or Ank'harel in their

1783
01:52:15,578 --> 01:52:21,663
size, none of them seem to really scrape the
surface of the sheer immensity of the City of Dis

1784
01:52:21,663 --> 01:52:23,196
by comparison.

1785
01:52:23,196 --> 01:52:27,943
LIAM: This should be easy.

1786
01:52:27,943 --> 01:52:32,702
TALIESIN: I wouldn't know from reading anything, I
wouldn't have a vague idea of where to go? I have

1787
01:52:32,702 --> 01:52:35,958
a theory at the moment, but it's pretty light.

1788
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:39,408
MATT: From what you read, it was mostly about the
structure of the society, there was no

1789
01:52:39,408 --> 01:52:42,375
well-written cartographer's experience--

1790
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:46,238
TALIESIN: Hitchhiker's Guide to the City of Dis. I
say we head to the tower.

1791
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:49,037
LAURA: The tower's in every direction.

1792
01:52:49,037 --> 01:52:51,531
TALIESIN: So, whichever direction it is, that's the
way we'll head.

1793
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:53,681
TRAVIS: Wow. That's true.

1794
01:52:53,681 --> 01:52:55,750
LIAM: So it's that way.

1795
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:57,502
MARISHA: And also that way!

1796
01:52:57,502 --> 01:53:00,060
LIAM: Some people go both ways.

1797
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:04,875
TALIESIN: I feel like if I were going to build a
giant tower that couldn't be ignored, I would have

1798
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:08,394
that be the center of anything and every place. It
may not even matter.

1799
01:53:08,394 --> 01:53:10,797
LIAM: Let's take a stroll and see a lay of the
land.

1800
01:53:10,797 --> 01:53:16,506
MARISHA: As we start taking a stroll, can I do a
nature check to see if I can spot any native

1801
01:53:16,506 --> 01:53:21,962
beasts, insects, etc.? Native animals, birds.

1802
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:23,405
MATT: Make a nature check.

1803
01:53:23,405 --> 01:53:25,462
MARISHA: Critters, and the usual.

1804
01:53:25,462 --> 01:53:29,313
MATT: Sure. This would be more perception,
actually because you're trying to pick up details

1805
01:53:29,313 --> 01:53:30,453
in the scenery.

1806
01:53:30,453 --> 01:53:31,642
MARISHA: Perception check?

1807
01:53:31,642 --> 01:53:33,396
MATT: Nature to understand if you knew what they
were.

1808
01:53:33,396 --> 01:53:35,022
MARISHA: That's a shithole roll: 14.

1809
01:53:35,022 --> 01:53:35,875
MATT: 14?

1810
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:36,868
MARISHA: Total.

1811
01:53:36,868 --> 01:53:44,653
MATT: You do, occasionally, catch what looks to be
some element of small, flying, buzzing pests, but

1812
01:53:44,653 --> 01:53:50,642
they're different than what you're used to. The
brief glances you get of one that comes nearby, it

1813
01:53:50,642 --> 01:53:56,181
seems to have eight sets of wings and some
horrid-looking pincers on the front and looks like

1814
01:53:56,181 --> 01:54:00,153
a nasty denizen of the scenery. And immediately,
you're like, "Ugh!"

1815
01:54:00,153 --> 01:54:06,312
TRAVIS: I lean over to Vex, and I say, oi. In an
effort to blend in, should we just

1816
01:54:06,312 --> 01:54:09,560
kill a random person?

1817
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:15,957
LAURA: I feel like only if it's called for, yeah?

1818
01:54:15,957 --> 01:54:19,916
TRAVIS: I just thought of it, so does that mean
it's called for? Is that what you do here?

1819
01:54:19,916 --> 01:54:23,011
LAURA: No, probably not just yet.

1820
01:54:23,011 --> 01:54:24,671
TRAVIS: They might really like it here.

1821
01:54:24,671 --> 01:54:26,876
LAURA: I know, they could, but they also thrive on
order.

1822
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:28,256
TRAVIS: Oh.

1823
01:54:28,256 --> 01:54:30,553
LAURA: And I feel like that's a little out of
order.

1824
01:54:30,553 --> 01:54:32,194
TRAVIS: Right. I'm glad I asked you.

1825
01:54:32,194 --> 01:54:33,329
LAURA: Me too.

1826
01:54:33,329 --> 01:54:34,213
TRAVIS: Okay.

1827
01:54:34,213 --> 01:54:35,222
LAURA: Keep doing that.

1828
01:54:35,222 --> 01:54:36,074
TRAVIS: Asking you?

1829
01:54:36,074 --> 01:54:37,365
LAURA: Yeah.

1830
01:54:37,365 --> 01:54:40,613
LIAM: Why is our life so much like Vaudeville?

1831
01:54:40,613 --> 01:54:42,416
MARISHA: You do like the theater.

1832
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:44,258
LIAM: That's true.

1833
01:54:44,258 --> 01:54:49,962
MARISHA: Do you think a Pass Without a Trace spell
would be beneficial here?

1834
01:54:49,962 --> 01:54:51,746
LAURA: It's concentration.

1835
01:54:51,746 --> 01:54:54,259
TALIESIN: Why try to be complicated?

1836
01:54:54,259 --> 01:54:56,511
LIAM: Let's just own this.

1837
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:57,808
TALIESIN: Let's own it.

1838
01:54:57,808 --> 01:54:59,293
LIAM: Take a walk. Percival.

1839
01:54:59,293 --> 01:55:00,477
TALIESIN: No fear!

1840
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:01,738
LIAM: Strut!

1841
01:55:01,738 --> 01:55:02,884
TALIESIN: I strut.

1842
01:55:02,884 --> 01:55:07,086
LAURA: (gasps) Maybe we can drop a little bit of
dust of tracelessness behind us, though, so

1843
01:55:07,086 --> 01:55:08,299
we're-- no?

1844
01:55:08,299 --> 01:55:18,973
TALIESIN: No, let's not make a scene. I'm going to
look for signs to look for the sorts of people who

1845
01:55:18,973 --> 01:55:23,694
are walking around, if there seems to be a flow of
traffic, if people seem to be going in a

1846
01:55:23,694 --> 01:55:25,451
direction, coming from a direction.

1847
01:55:25,451 --> 01:55:26,314
MATT: Okay!

1848
01:55:26,314 --> 01:55:27,755
TALIESIN: Getting a sense of the city.

1849
01:55:27,755 --> 01:55:29,005
MATT: While heading towards the tower?

1850
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:33,221
TALIESIN: While heading towards the tower to make
sure that I am trying to get a lay of the land so

1851
01:55:33,221 --> 01:55:37,775
maybe I can see if we should veer off in a
direction. I'm also looking for humans, someone

1852
01:55:37,775 --> 01:55:39,612
who might speak Common.

1853
01:55:39,612 --> 01:55:43,153
LIAM: And, are there stores, are there businesses?
Are these all non-descript buildings, or does it

1854
01:55:43,153 --> 01:55:45,681
all just look like the same shit? Or is it--

1855
01:55:45,681 --> 01:55:50,601
MATT: They are varying, but there's nothing here
that looks like a welcoming shopfront. The

1856
01:55:50,601 --> 01:55:57,360
structures are varied, but any of the signs or any
of the scrollings that you see chiseled into the

1857
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:00,116
stonework and metal is not a language--

1858
01:56:00,116 --> 01:56:02,415
LIAM: So, it's like a hellish financial district,
there's just nothing there.

1859
01:56:02,415 --> 01:56:08,518
MATT: Loosely, yeah. It looks like Detroit on
Halloween.

1860
01:56:08,518 --> 01:56:11,086
LIAM: Purge!

1861
01:56:11,086 --> 01:56:13,451
TRAVIS: Love you, Detroit.

1862
01:56:13,451 --> 01:56:15,654
TALIESIN: It's been a while.

1863
01:56:15,654 --> 01:56:18,411
MATT: Yeah, man. Devil's Night, it's great.

1864
01:56:18,411 --> 01:56:20,601
LIAM: Hell.

1865
01:56:20,601 --> 01:56:33,291
MATT: So, you follow. As Doty's (stomping) behind
Tary, staying as close to the middle of all of you

1866
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:39,937
guys and shielding himself between your various
bodies. You continue to follow Percival as you

1867
01:56:39,937 --> 01:56:47,068
step through, paying attention. Go ahead and make
an investigation check.

1868
01:56:47,068 --> 01:56:49,703
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out for anybody
that looks like they're noticing

1869
01:56:49,703 --> 01:56:51,823
us too much, anything.

1870
01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:52,820
LIAM: Yeah, same.

1871
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:53,769
LAURA: Of course.

1872
01:56:53,769 --> 01:56:54,838
TRAVIS: Natural snitch.

1873
01:56:54,838 --> 01:56:55,657
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1874
01:56:55,657 --> 01:56:57,214
MARISHA: Natural snitch!

1875
01:56:57,214 --> 01:56:58,219
MATT: You are--

1876
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:59,323
TALIESIN: -- a problem.

1877
01:56:59,323 --> 01:57:00,825
MATT: You are a problem.

1878
01:57:00,825 --> 01:57:05,897
TALIESIN: I may have to-- I'm aware that there's a
lifespan on this die, that I may eventually need

1879
01:57:05,897 --> 01:57:07,048
to put it away.

1880
01:57:07,048 --> 01:57:08,484
LIAM: We are in hell. If it's going to come out
anywhere--

1881
01:57:08,484 --> 01:57:11,868
TRAVIS: If you roll one more natural 20, it's just
going to dissolve into gold dust and float away.

1882
01:57:11,868 --> 01:57:13,512
TALIESIN: Heads.

1883
01:57:13,512 --> 01:57:15,374
MATT: It's okay. One of these days, your contract
will come to me.

1884
01:57:15,374 --> 01:57:16,908
TALIESIN: I'm well aware.

1885
01:57:16,908 --> 01:57:21,740
LIAM: If you lift up Taliesin's mohawk, you can
see the little tiny, little points. Little horns.

1886
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:23,370
MARISHA: Yep.

1887
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:39,027
MATT: Or the maze. You walk for the next ten or so
minutes. Two things you notice, looking for

1888
01:57:39,027 --> 01:57:49,433
patterns and elements of the city around. There
does seem to be a general direction of, not

1889
01:57:49,433 --> 01:57:56,273
individuals as such, but a lot of these fleshy
masses, which you've read about in the book,

1890
01:57:56,273 --> 01:58:03,669
they're referred to as lemures. They are fallen
damned souls that have been tortured into this

1891
01:58:03,669 --> 01:58:09,124
specific form that are the lowest base level of
devil that exists here.

1892
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:12,691
MARISHA: Just a fleshy mass, Liam.

1893
01:58:12,691 --> 01:58:15,517
LIAM: I want to go to bed.

1894
01:58:15,517 --> 01:58:22,935
MATT: But a lot of them seem to be going in this
certain direction. It's difficult to maintain

1895
01:58:22,986 --> 01:58:27,521
focus on the direction of the tower if you have to
avert your eyes. However, if you're looking in a

1896
01:58:27,521 --> 01:58:31,527
particular direction, it doesn't follow your
vision when you move, it's whenever you

1897
01:58:31,662 --> 01:58:36,001
have to look away and change your perspective on
the horizon, that's when it appears elsewhere. So,

1898
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:45,825
you assert yourself in a direction and maintain
that way. After about ten, 15 minutes, there's no

1899
01:58:45,825 --> 01:58:48,958
discernable gaining of distance on the tower.

1900
01:58:48,958 --> 01:58:50,265
LIAM: Oh, for fuck's sake.

1901
01:58:50,265 --> 01:58:58,465
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to find a lemure
and inquire sternly of directions.

1902
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:00,134
MATT: Okay.

1903
01:59:00,134 --> 01:59:02,294
MARISHA: Sternly?

1904
01:59:02,294 --> 01:59:09,106
MATT: As you're walking, you see there are three
of them currently that are chained together with

1905
01:59:09,106 --> 01:59:17,149
two of these weird black, jagged spiked collar and
midsection bands that are jammed into their sides

1906
01:59:17,149 --> 01:59:24,259
and they're all joined and the hooks and the
chains are screwed into the side of this building.

1907
01:59:24,259 --> 01:59:29,547
They do not appear to be currently attended at the
moment. And, as you approach one is there like

1908
01:59:29,605 --> 01:59:32,313
(gurgling).

1909
01:59:32,313 --> 01:59:35,640
TALIESIN: Kuthok.

1910
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:40,287
MATT: (pained gurgling)

1911
01:59:40,287 --> 01:59:42,039
TALIESIN: Marketplace.

1912
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:44,439
MATT: (pained gurgling)

1913
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:46,337
TALIESIN: Point.

1914
01:59:46,337 --> 01:59:49,231
LIAM: That is fucking disgusting.

1915
01:59:49,231 --> 01:59:56,451
MATT: There is no language. It looks like it can't
really communicate.

1916
01:59:56,451 --> 01:59:57,458
LAURA: Oh god.

1917
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:58,364
MARISHA: Wow.

1918
01:59:58,364 --> 01:59:59,351
LAURA: That's really sad.

1919
01:59:59,351 --> 02:00:00,833
MARISHA: It kind of is.

1920
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:07,971
TALIESIN: Well, that's depressing. All right. What
building are they currently chained to?

1921
02:00:08,045 --> 02:00:22,428
MATT: It's about a three-story tall, long tower.
It's long on one side and then half the size on

1922
02:00:22,428 --> 02:00:25,920
the other, and it juts up like a monolith that
comes from these two hooks at the top. There's no

1923
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:34,017
signs or particular language on its exterior, but
there does appear to be a doorway, a big, black

1924
02:00:34,017 --> 02:00:41,561
metal iron doorway that is closed maybe a foot to
the left of them. You're--

1925
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:46,074
LAURA: Does it look like people are coming in and
out of that building?

1926
02:00:46,074 --> 02:00:48,572
MATT: If you wait a moment, you can find out.

1927
02:00:48,572 --> 02:00:50,993
LAURA: Maybe we can post up and see, or just walk
on in.

1928
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:53,553
TALIESIN: I wouldn't recommend walking on in.

1929
02:00:53,553 --> 02:00:59,038
LIAM: We're walking and nothing's changing. Do we
want to stay put for a while and see what

1930
02:00:59,038 --> 02:01:00,737
happens?

1931
02:01:00,737 --> 02:01:03,004
LAURA: Well, our surroundings are changing, we're
just not--

1932
02:01:03,004 --> 02:01:11,749
MATT: (crashing noise) At this point, the door
shifts open with a slam, there's a burst of

1933
02:01:11,749 --> 02:01:21,451
phosphorous-type clouded fume that drifts out from
the interior as, curling down, looming from the

1934
02:01:21,451 --> 02:01:28,025
inside, another one of those large, lanky,
skeletal-looking devils with the giant scorpion

1935
02:01:28,025 --> 02:01:37,943
tail lurches out, and sees all of you clustered
over, and begins to rush up quickly and grabs the

1936
02:01:37,943 --> 02:01:42,588
side of where the hook is jammed into the wall and
just breaks it out with its bare strength, and

1937
02:01:42,588 --> 02:01:53,937
yanks the lemures closer. (speaks Infernal) You
see its jaw almost seems to disconnect and unhinge

1938
02:01:53,937 --> 02:02:05,021
for a moment as it gets impossibly long and its
tongue (slurping noise) and begins to just walk

1939
02:02:05,021 --> 02:02:08,756
away from you guys down the road, dragging these
lemures behind it from the chains.

1940
02:02:08,756 --> 02:02:12,648
LAURA: As soon as he opened the door, I wanted to
get a look inside of where he came out.

1941
02:02:12,648 --> 02:02:15,463
MATT: Perception check.

1942
02:02:17,088 --> 02:02:21,530
LAURA: It was almost a 20, but it was a 25.

1943
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:30,855
MATT: 25? You get a very brief glance on the
inside. Very dark, red light seems to slightly

1944
02:02:30,855 --> 02:02:41,807
light the interior. It looks almost like a shelf
of some kind. That's as much of a view as you got.

1945
02:02:41,807 --> 02:02:46,064
It was just some sort of a shelf, bit of furniture
in the side there.

1946
02:02:46,064 --> 02:02:47,559
LAURA: Fuck.

1947
02:02:47,559 --> 02:02:50,723
LIAM: Hotis, where the fuck are you?

1948
02:02:50,723 --> 02:02:53,728
LAURA: Where's a fucking place we can have a
stupid feast?

1949
02:02:53,728 --> 02:03:00,764
MARISHA: If we can get to a safe, quiet place, I
can do a Locate Creature spell and see if I can find

1950
02:03:00,764 --> 02:03:05,182
him. I can also scry on him, but I need to--

1951
02:03:05,252 --> 02:03:07,491
LAURA: You need something--

1952
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:11,885
MARISHA: Something not in this back alley of a
street.

1953
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:14,771
LIAM: Did that devil who just left leave the door
wide open, or did it shut it?

1954
02:03:14,771 --> 02:03:19,115
MATT: No, the door slammed open and as it walked
towards you guys, slammed it shut behind it.

1955
02:03:19,115 --> 02:03:21,338
TALIESIN: Which way did the creature go?

1956
02:03:21,338 --> 02:03:25,861
MATT: Loosely the same direction as where you were
walking for the tower.

1957
02:03:25,861 --> 02:03:27,621
LAURA and TALIESIN: Keep walking in that
direction--

1958
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:35,673
TALIESIN: See if we can gently catch up, just to
the vague periphery, so if I can see them, then

1959
02:03:35,673 --> 02:03:37,655
great, and if not, oh well.

1960
02:03:37,655 --> 02:03:39,463
MATT: Are you following this group? Is that what's
going on?

1961
02:03:39,463 --> 02:03:43,638
TALIESIN: (indecisive noise) From a gentle long
distance, and not with great intent.

1962
02:03:43,638 --> 02:03:46,715
MARISHA: Was he talking to the lemures, or to us?

1963
02:03:46,715 --> 02:03:48,447
MATT: Talking to you guys.

1964
02:03:48,447 --> 02:03:50,432
MARISHA: To back the fuck off? Okay.

1965
02:03:50,432 --> 02:03:52,266
MATT: You were clustered around, apparently, his
charge or--

1966
02:03:52,266 --> 02:03:56,814
MARISHA: His, yeah, his people. "Back the fuck off
from my people", yeah.

1967
02:03:56,814 --> 02:03:59,989
TALIESIN: That was a chain devil?

1968
02:03:59,989 --> 02:04:03,323
MATT: No, this was a bone devil.

1969
02:04:03,323 --> 02:04:05,673
TALIESIN: That was a bone devil? All right.

1970
02:04:05,673 --> 02:04:07,046
MATT: I can show you what that looks like.

1971
02:04:07,046 --> 02:04:11,737
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

1972
02:04:11,737 --> 02:04:17,112
MARISHA: This means I could theoretically turn
into him now that I've met them, right?

1973
02:04:17,112 --> 02:04:18,387
MATT: Technically, yeah.

1974
02:04:18,387 --> 02:04:21,273
TALIESIN: That won't go poorly.

1975
02:04:21,273 --> 02:04:22,653
MARISHA: Nope!

1976
02:04:22,653 --> 02:04:26,527
TRAVIS: Get. The fuck. Out of my nightmares.

1977
02:04:26,527 --> 02:04:32,687
TALIESIN: (Minnesotan accent) "Hello, we're from
outta town, y'know?"

1978
02:04:32,687 --> 02:04:34,803
LAURA, MARISHA and TALIESIN: (Minnesotan accent)
"Oh, don't ya know?"

1979
02:04:34,803 --> 02:04:37,310
MARISHA: (Minnesotan accent) "Yo, I got my
Polaroid with me."

1980
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:39,751
MATT: "Oh, hello."

1981
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:42,652
ALL: "Oh, hello."

1982
02:04:42,652 --> 02:04:44,387
TRAVIS: And we all fall out.

1983
02:04:44,387 --> 02:04:48,026
TALIESIN: And we all die. Too much Fargo lately.

1984
02:04:48,026 --> 02:05:01,305
MATT: As you tail this from a distance, go ahead
and make a stealth check, Percival.

1985
02:05:03,544 --> 02:05:08,344
TALIESIN: Well, that's-- 15.

1986
02:05:08,344 --> 02:05:11,828
MATT: Okay.

1987
02:05:11,828 --> 02:05:14,295
TALIESIN: I'm not-- (indecisive noise) Keeping my
distance.

1988
02:05:14,295 --> 02:05:17,336
MARISHA: He's D-Rollin'.

1989
02:05:17,336 --> 02:05:20,949
LAURA: They see me-- no.

1990
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:26,676
MARISHA: I love Laura bailing so fast.

1991
02:05:27,582 --> 02:05:36,517
MATT: As you guys are following Percival's lead
along the roads here, the heat is starting to

1992
02:05:36,517 --> 02:05:44,534
really crawl under your armor-- those of you who
are wearing it, you're fine, Grog. You watch as

1993
02:05:44,534 --> 02:05:50,116
the lemures are dragged off into an alley to the
right.

1994
02:05:50,116 --> 02:05:52,991
TALIESIN: If they go to an alley, then I'm not
going to go down an alley. I'm going to walk by

1995
02:05:52,991 --> 02:05:56,546
and maybe look down the alley from across the
street, but I'm not--

1996
02:05:56,546 --> 02:05:58,450
I'm trying to stay on main roads.

1997
02:05:58,450 --> 02:06:03,942
MATT: You make a large arc around and glance over.
You can see them being pulled down the alleyway,

1998
02:06:03,942 --> 02:06:07,692
and then to the left around the corner.

1999
02:06:07,692 --> 02:06:16,062
TALIESIN: No-- That feels like a trap to me. That
feels like the sort of thing I would do if I

2000
02:06:16,062 --> 02:06:19,315
wanted to shank someone in an alley.

2001
02:06:19,315 --> 02:06:21,718
LIAM: I've done that, actually, that's true.

2002
02:06:21,718 --> 02:06:23,624
TALIESIN: I knew you had.

2003
02:06:23,624 --> 02:06:27,655
LAURA: Do I see any buildings that look like
people are coming in and out raucously?

2004
02:06:27,655 --> 02:06:33,258
MATT: Not yet, no.

2005
02:06:33,258 --> 02:06:37,220
LIAM: What if we walked for a while and looked
back. Let's give it ten minutes, and then we'll

2006
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:38,536
figure something out.

2007
02:06:38,536 --> 02:06:41,686
TALIESIN: We'll take a left at the next main
thoroughfare.

2008
02:06:41,804 --> 02:06:43,253
MATT: Okay.

2009
02:06:43,327 --> 02:06:45,918
LAURA: He's going to keep an eye out for anybody watching
us.

2010
02:06:45,976 --> 02:06:47,604
MATT: Perception check.

2011
02:06:47,678 --> 02:06:51,564
LAURA: While I'm looking for buildings.

2012
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:52,900
LIAM: 27.

2013
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:57,365
MATT: Okay. You do hear the occasional screech in
the air, as you see these winged entities in the

2014
02:06:57,365 --> 02:07:04,350
distance just (screeching). As they just dive
through and around the top of the city.

2015
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:08,183
MARISHA: Do we recognise what they are? Are they
wyverns? What are they?

2016
02:07:08,183 --> 02:07:13,382
MATT: No, there's a humanoid aspect to their
bodies but they're just beyond the general red

2017
02:07:13,382 --> 02:07:15,800
glow of the city to make out their details.

2018
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:21,292
MARISHA: I'm going to try and start focusing on
that for the next walk. When one gets down close,

2019
02:07:21,292 --> 02:07:22,995
I want to see if I can see what it is?

2020
02:07:22,995 --> 02:07:31,009
MATT: Okay. Some of them look to be imps. Armored
imps. These tiny little things that dive through.

2021
02:07:31,009 --> 02:07:35,399
Some appear to be larger. Some have long tails
that draw behind them, their giant leathery wings,

2022
02:07:35,399 --> 02:07:39,581
and they just glide through. You get a glance at
one that seems to have a human torso and legs that

2023
02:07:39,581 --> 02:07:46,068
are hanging at its sides as it swoops through,
like a sentinel just watching over the city. A lot

2024
02:07:46,068 --> 02:07:50,474
seem to be doing arcs to and from the tower as you
watch these patterns--

2025
02:07:50,474 --> 02:07:54,819
LAURA: I could fly up in the air and see if I can
spot a market.

2026
02:07:54,819 --> 02:08:02,179
MARISHA: I could Beast Shape into something that's
natural--

2027
02:08:02,179 --> 02:08:03,985
LIAM: That's better.

2028
02:08:03,985 --> 02:08:05,107
TALIESIN: Is it?

2029
02:08:05,107 --> 02:08:07,387
LIAM: Better? Well, I don't like anybody going
up.

2030
02:08:07,387 --> 02:08:13,232
MATT: Ten minutes' travel, Percival, by the way?
Still not anywhere near closer to the tower.

2031
02:08:13,232 --> 02:08:19,055
MARISHA: Weird thought: what if we try to walk
away from the tower?

2032
02:08:19,055 --> 02:08:22,265
TALIESIN: There is no walking away from the
tower.

2033
02:08:22,265 --> 02:08:25,812
LIAM: This is stupid. What if I think about being
in front of the tower?

2034
02:08:25,812 --> 02:08:29,683
MATT: Do you just think about it?

2035
02:08:29,683 --> 02:08:33,038
LIAM: Yeah. That's it.

2036
02:08:33,038 --> 02:08:39,470
MATT: Okay, so you walk towards the tower, but
thinking about being there. So you guys keep

2037
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:46,641
walking for a bit. You get about two blocks before
you see the next major road turns to the right,

2038
02:08:46,641 --> 02:08:58,311
and there you can see, this road you've been on,
which seemed sparse as far as the denizens of the

2039
02:08:58,311 --> 02:09:04,696
City of Dis-- As soon as this big roadway opens to
the right of you, the buildings seem to grow

2040
02:09:04,696 --> 02:09:11,289
larger and taller, and they seem to almost twist
and collide the higher they get. They're all

2041
02:09:11,289 --> 02:09:19,723
constructed from metal and iron, but there's
almost an organic, natural curvature at times that

2042
02:09:19,723 --> 02:09:25,900
seems warped, causing a few to almost seem to
collide and jut into each other at their peak.

2043
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:30,482
Many of them have these big, black metal chains
that dangle from the outside, and giant,

2044
02:09:30,482 --> 02:09:35,210
evil-looking hooks mounted onto the front of the
buildings, some of which currently hold lemures

2045
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:43,394
that sit there and writhe on it, like a punishment
for something they did. In the roads themselves, a

2046
02:09:43,394 --> 02:09:47,299
lot of them have pikes jutting up, and it looks
like sections of the road cracked open, and there

2047
02:09:47,299 --> 02:09:53,401
are natural rock spikes and formations that have
protruded out from the ancient construct of the

2048
02:09:53,401 --> 02:09:57,970
city. But people just walk around them as they go.
And you do see more people down this way. You see

2049
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:05,970
more of those devil-like creatures, you see a few
tieflings in the distance. You see a few humans.

2050
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:15,118
You see a few fair-skinned folk wandering through.
You see that same bone devil that earlier you saw

2051
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:23,602
emerge from the side alleyway about two blocks up,
still clutching those three other lemures behind

2052
02:10:23,602 --> 02:10:29,378
it by chain. It walks up to another bone devil
that seems to be sitting off to the side, and is

2053
02:10:29,378 --> 02:10:35,058
in the process of scratching the side of its
horrible, bony chin and jaw. It comes up to it,

2054
02:10:35,058 --> 02:10:40,793
and they both speak and snarl. You cannot read
their lips, because they don't really have lips,

2055
02:10:40,793 --> 02:10:48,457
and you don't know Infernal. But they both almost
become a unit, and walking side-by-side head

2056
02:10:48,457 --> 02:10:55,102
further down that path, with the three chained
lemures behind them. Glancing over, you do see, as

2057
02:10:55,102 --> 02:10:59,995
you've been focusing on the ground and around you,
look up, and the tower has shifted position down

2058
02:10:59,995 --> 02:11:04,189
to the end of that roadway. You thinking of it--

2059
02:11:04,189 --> 02:11:08,290
LAURA: Was that what did it?

2060
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:17,189
MATT: No. It's still the same distance it ever has
been. In the process of losing its sight from your

2061
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:21,340
peripheral, due to other buildings closing off
your vision-- As soon as you lose sight of it

2062
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:26,808
entirely and reassess where your vision is on the
horizon, there the tower is once more.

2063
02:11:26,808 --> 02:11:29,240
LIAM: Does it always feel like it's dead ahead of
us, all the time?

2064
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:30,828
LAURA: No, it's always off to the side, right?

2065
02:11:30,828 --> 02:11:38,096
MATT: It changes. As soon as you become aware of
the horizon, it becomes oriented wherever that

2066
02:11:38,096 --> 02:11:40,045
awareness is.

2067
02:11:40,045 --> 02:11:48,440
LAURA: How about I watch any of the people, the
humanoids, or anything like that, that are

2068
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:53,345
together-- Can I see them talking, does it look
like any of them are speaking Common, if I'm

2069
02:11:53,345 --> 02:11:54,762
trying to read their lips--

2070
02:11:54,762 --> 02:11:57,482
MATT: They're quite a ways away from you. You're
not able to make out any detail.

2071
02:11:57,482 --> 02:12:02,055
LAURA: I'll walk in the direction, just get in the
area that they're in, so that I can try to read

2072
02:12:02,055 --> 02:12:03,180
their lips.

2073
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:07,105
MARISHA: Once again, I want to keep an eye out,
because I had a shitty perception check, for any

2074
02:12:07,105 --> 02:12:11,310
birds, bats, beasts that I see flying?

2075
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:18,892
MATT: No birds, no bats, no beasts. There isn't a
whole lot of indigenous wildlife within the Hells,

2076
02:12:18,892 --> 02:12:22,484
it seems. Or at least nothing that would be
considered a beast.

2077
02:12:22,484 --> 02:12:24,071
MARISHA: Insects?

2078
02:12:24,071 --> 02:12:30,631
MATT: Even the insect you saw earlier, or the
insect-like creature, it had twisted, fiendish

2079
02:12:30,631 --> 02:12:32,816
qualities to it on a very micro scale.

2080
02:12:32,816 --> 02:12:34,390
LIAM: That was an ambassador.

2081
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:37,428
MARISHA: It probably was! That's the thing, it
probably was!

2082
02:12:37,428 --> 02:12:43,643
LIAM: I'm going to trail my sister by like ten
feet and watch her back.

2083
02:12:43,643 --> 02:12:51,188
MATT: You're moving closer to get a view of
lip-reading. What's everyone else doing?

2084
02:12:51,188 --> 02:12:54,309
TRAVIS: Is the ground as hot as the walls are?

2085
02:12:54,309 --> 02:13:00,303
MATT: It is. Even as you're walking, you've grown
somewhat accustomed to the uncomfortable heat that

2086
02:13:00,303 --> 02:13:06,417
your boots are currently mustering. Thankfully,
you guys are wearing footwear designed to endure

2087
02:13:06,417 --> 02:13:13,853
environmental hazards, or magical footwear, for
some of you. But you imagine if you were to stand

2088
02:13:13,853 --> 02:13:18,539
still for too long in one place, it would probably
end up damaging any sort of

2089
02:13:18,539 --> 02:13:20,162
regular footwear worn.

2090
02:13:20,162 --> 02:13:23,418
TRAVIS: Jesus. It's like a parking lot in Texas.

2091
02:13:23,418 --> 02:13:29,419
TALIESIN: Venice in August. Beach, not--

2092
02:13:29,419 --> 02:13:35,299
TRAVIS: Is there anything about the humans in
particular? Are they wearing anything unusual, or

2093
02:13:35,299 --> 02:13:42,471
do they have any company with them that might
denote why they're allowed to roam about?

2094
02:13:42,471 --> 02:13:50,876
MATT: The two that you see ahead of you, a man and
a woman, the man has stark white hair that is

2095
02:13:50,876 --> 02:14:02,184
almost wet, and brushed very tight to the back of
the skull, with a series of black and red markings

2096
02:14:02,184 --> 02:14:08,485
or tattoos, or some sort of scar, that goes across
one side of his face. A very, very thick nose

2097
02:14:08,485 --> 02:14:14,022
piercing that connects to a chain that links to
the back of his ear and is wearing layered, black

2098
02:14:14,022 --> 02:14:19,961
leather armor. The woman, who is currently
conversing with him on the other side, has long

2099
02:14:19,961 --> 02:14:31,130
black hair with a shock of white that curls to the
front. Her skin is a deep reddish brown, tan

2100
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:41,673
color, and her armor is a dull gray, like a
cloth-patterned armor? But she seems to have at

2101
02:14:41,673 --> 02:14:46,142
her side a very wicked-looking scimitar that is
hanging at her belt, and she rests her arm on it,

2102
02:14:46,142 --> 02:14:55,045
casually. You look just past them, and you can see
they have two sacks resting on the ground as

2103
02:14:55,045 --> 02:15:00,862
they're having this conversation, and a cage.

2104
02:15:00,862 --> 02:15:02,306
TRAVIS: Empty?

2105
02:15:02,306 --> 02:15:06,015
MATT: The cage is not empty, there is something
inside, but you're not quite close enough to make

2106
02:15:06,015 --> 02:15:08,633
out any details. You can just see there is a cage
and some shape inside.

2107
02:15:08,633 --> 02:15:12,562
You make a perception check.

2108
02:15:15,799 --> 02:15:23,165
LAURA: That's cocked. (deep voice) 27.

2109
02:15:23,165 --> 02:15:35,678
MATT: I will say make a stealth check as well.
This is to both get close enough to witness their

2110
02:15:35,678 --> 02:15:39,811
conversation but not be noticed as overtly trying
to--

2111
02:15:39,811 --> 02:15:41,052
LAURA: 17.

2112
02:15:41,052 --> 02:15:42,464
MATT: Okay.

2113
02:15:42,464 --> 02:15:44,893
LAURA: That was bad.

2114
02:15:44,893 --> 02:15:52,715
MATT: You saddle up and instinctually go to lean
on the wall. And go (winces). This is not

2115
02:15:52,715 --> 02:16:00,216
conducive to your usual casual tactics. But you
pay attention and you catch bits and pieces of

2116
02:16:00,216 --> 02:16:08,938
their conversation. They're arguing about price.
They are both talking about how much it's worth.

2117
02:16:08,938 --> 02:16:14,982
Is it even worth bringing it here? We've come this
far. We already have the offer. Might as well go

2118
02:16:14,982 --> 02:16:20,144
through with it. One of them talks about how they
hate the Fetters.

2119
02:16:20,144 --> 02:16:22,104
LAURA: The Fetters?

2120
02:16:22,104 --> 02:16:23,752
MATT: The Fetters.

2121
02:16:23,752 --> 02:16:27,600
TRAVIS: (whispers) I bet it's one of those little
dudes we had.

2122
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:37,008
MATT: Then one of them goes, let's get going, this
place makes me feel uncomfortable.

2123
02:16:37,008 --> 02:16:40,261
LAURA: I still can't see what they have in the
cage?

2124
02:16:40,261 --> 02:16:48,838
MATT: You can glance just barely past and you can
see what looks to be some sort of a humanoid.

2125
02:16:48,838 --> 02:16:57,420
Naked. You can't make out much more detail. You
can't tell if it's male or female. It appears to

2126
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:02,653
be medium- to light-skinned. You can't get much
detail beyond that

2127
02:17:02,653 --> 02:17:04,330
from this distance, unfortunately.

2128
02:17:04,330 --> 02:17:05,919
MARISHA: How big is this cage?

2129
02:17:05,919 --> 02:17:14,645
MATT: It's maybe four foot by three foot. A little
smaller, actually. It would be more like three

2130
02:17:14,645 --> 02:17:17,621
foot by two foot, because it looks pretty cramped.

2131
02:17:17,621 --> 02:17:21,725
LAURA: I'm going to walk up to them. Before they
walk away.

2132
02:17:21,725 --> 02:17:27,660
MATT: As they both start turning to walk, one of
them--

2133
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:30,604
LAURA: I'm going to be casual as I do it. I just
walk up.

2134
02:17:30,604 --> 02:17:34,021
MATT: You can see there is a couple of chains
fixed to the front of this cage and there is a

2135
02:17:34,021 --> 02:17:39,089
handle of some kind that the guy lifts. There are
small wheels you can now see that are fixed onto

2136
02:17:39,089 --> 02:17:41,184
the cage that you can now see as it rolls--

2137
02:17:41,184 --> 02:17:44,494
LAURA: I don't even look at the cage at all, like
I don't give a shit about it.

2138
02:17:44,494 --> 02:17:49,165
And I walk up and I say--

2139
02:17:49,165 --> 02:17:53,304
MATT: The woman immediately turns and sees you,
and her hand moves from resting on the pommel of

2140
02:17:53,304 --> 02:17:56,214
the blade to grasping the handle.

2141
02:17:56,214 --> 02:17:57,733
LIAM: Same.

2142
02:17:57,733 --> 02:17:59,781
LAURA: Oh! Are you with me?

2143
02:17:59,781 --> 02:18:01,959
LIAM: Ten feet behind you.

2144
02:18:01,959 --> 02:18:09,441
LAURA: I signal at you to come over. I don't want
to look like I'm talking to the people, yet. I'm

2145
02:18:09,441 --> 02:18:13,504
just walking in their direction, and I lean over
to my brother and say, God I hate this place,

2146
02:18:13,504 --> 02:18:15,199
don't you?

2147
02:18:15,199 --> 02:18:17,307
LIAM: Yep. Pretty much.

2148
02:18:17,307 --> 02:18:19,952
LAURA: (exhales) It's so hot. I wish we were back
home.

2149
02:18:19,952 --> 02:18:22,182
LIAM: Everything fucking looks the same.

2150
02:18:22,182 --> 02:18:23,127
LAURA: Right.

2151
02:18:23,127 --> 02:18:24,491
LIAM: Nondescript bullshit.

2152
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:26,938
LAURA: I make eye contact with the woman as I say
it.

2153
02:18:26,938 --> 02:18:36,760
MATT: Make a subtle deception check. They are
intensely paranoid, it seems.

2154
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:42,037
LAURA: 30-- no, 20-- 21.

2155
02:18:42,037 --> 02:18:51,346
MATT: She stands there, and keeps watching you.
The guy who was pulling the cage stops, turns

2156
02:18:51,346 --> 02:18:55,271
around and looks. You can see the chain swing and
dangle for a second before coming to a stop as he

2157
02:18:55,271 --> 02:19:05,142
glances back, his eyes iris-less. Just dark pupils
with white around them. And he just-- not a snarl,

2158
02:19:05,142 --> 02:19:11,204
but a very intense stare, he doesn't seem to be
put at ease, but he's

2159
02:19:11,386 --> 02:19:12,386
definitely paying attention.

2160
02:19:12,386 --> 02:19:13,651
(cell phone rings)

2161
02:19:13,651 --> 02:19:15,056
LAURA: Can I help you?

2162
02:19:15,056 --> 02:19:17,431
MATT: As he silences his cell phone.

2163
02:19:22,531 --> 02:19:23,828
"I'm sorry, what?"

2164
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,450
LAURA: You were staring at me, darling.

2165
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:33,640
MATT: "You, unless I'm mistaken, approached our
space."

2166
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:42,276
LAURA: Oh, you had claimed it. Sorry. Everything
here's claimed.

2167
02:19:42,348 --> 02:19:47,773
MATT: She turns around, and gives him the
expression of, fucking shove off, and he takes the

2168
02:19:47,773 --> 02:19:51,836
chain, and begins to tug it and they both walk
away.

2169
02:19:51,836 --> 02:20:01,592
LAURA: That didn't go as well as I planned.
(laughs) I just want to find a fucking tavern!

2170
02:20:01,592 --> 02:20:03,547
MATT: You just let them walk away?

2171
02:20:03,547 --> 02:20:07,450
LAURA: Yeah, but as they walk away I want to look
at the fucking cage and really get a good look at

2172
02:20:07,450 --> 02:20:08,887
what they had.

2173
02:20:08,887 --> 02:20:18,336
MATT: Glancing inside, you're not sure how old or
how young, but there is a definitely beaten,

2174
02:20:18,336 --> 02:20:34,675
wounded young man. Between the streaks of blood
and visible gashes and lash marks, the skin seems

2175
02:20:34,675 --> 02:20:43,658
pretty vibrant and clean. This is a creature that
was taken here. This person was taken here against

2176
02:20:43,658 --> 02:20:48,446
their interest and is being dragged in a
direction.

2177
02:20:48,446 --> 02:20:54,028
LAURA: All right, before they walk off I go, oi!
You made a deal for that one yet?

2178
02:20:54,028 --> 02:20:59,606
MATT: They turn back and look at you. "Yeah."

2179
02:20:59,606 --> 02:21:06,349
LAURA: Where do you go? I have something I'd like
to sell as well.

2180
02:21:06,349 --> 02:21:12,229
MATT: "We don't share our clients." And they both
just keep walking back in the

2181
02:21:12,229 --> 02:21:14,837
direction they were going.

2182
02:21:14,837 --> 02:21:19,599
LAURA: It's not working. I'm trying so hard.

2183
02:21:19,599 --> 02:21:22,899
MARISHA: You're doing great. It was amazing.

2184
02:21:22,899 --> 02:21:24,647
LIAM: Hey, man.

2185
02:21:24,647 --> 02:21:26,284
LAURA: (whispers) Oh god!

2186
02:21:26,284 --> 02:21:31,628
LIAM: What about-- I want to get off the street.
I'm tired of walking. We've been walking all--

2187
02:21:31,628 --> 02:21:34,860
MATT: He's about 20 feet from you.

2188
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:36,508
LIAM: We've been walking all day.

2189
02:21:36,508 --> 02:21:40,612
MATT: He's not even turning around. They are just
walking away.

2190
02:21:40,612 --> 02:21:42,451
LIAM: Are you whispering that to me?

2191
02:21:42,451 --> 02:21:50,895
LAURA: Yes, I am whispering to you. It didn't
work. We find other people.

2192
02:21:50,895 --> 02:21:54,285
TRAVIS: I am currently spitting on the ground and
watching it evaporate.

2193
02:21:54,285 --> 02:21:56,306
MATT: And it does. It's like (psh).

2194
02:21:56,306 --> 02:21:58,551
TRAVIS: Ooh!

2195
02:21:58,551 --> 02:22:02,458
LAURA: I mean, do I see a tavern around here? It
seems like a busy sort of street.

2196
02:22:02,458 --> 02:22:06,872
MATT: (laughs) You can keep walking and looking
for some sort of a tavern.

2197
02:22:06,872 --> 02:22:09,510
TALIESIN: Are there any other people around? I'm
going to give a roll.

2198
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:14,935
MATT: Sure, I mean, there are people, those are
the only two humans that you had seen in the

2199
02:22:14,935 --> 02:22:18,619
vicinity. Again, you saw--

2200
02:22:18,619 --> 02:22:19,947
TALIESIN: Tieflings?

2201
02:22:19,947 --> 02:22:28,420
MATT: -- you saw a handful of tieflings a little
even further down the road and you see a few

2202
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:35,410
humanoid-like devils that are just covered in
barbs and spines that seem to walk in spurts, like

2203
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:39,728
they'll step, step, and then dash a few steps and
then stop and then glance around nervously and

2204
02:22:39,728 --> 02:22:43,826
then continue forward. Roughly human-sized, maybe
a little smaller.

2205
02:22:43,826 --> 02:22:49,339
MARISHA: Is everyone here afraid that they're
going to be murdered at any corner?

2206
02:22:49,339 --> 02:22:54,085
TALIESIN: No, obviously-- just us. Let's
try this proper. I'm going to start walking and

2207
02:22:54,306 --> 02:22:56,715
see if I can make eye contact with anything.

2208
02:22:56,715 --> 02:22:59,683
MARISHA: You're going to try to make eye contact
with these people?

2209
02:22:59,683 --> 02:23:03,088
MATT: Are you guys following them or are you
staying back with your party?

2210
02:23:03,088 --> 02:23:05,509
TALIESIN: Well, I am walking in their direction
anyway--

2211
02:23:05,509 --> 02:23:10,880
MATT: You guys have caught up to them now and
Percival is apparently walking forward so--

2212
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:12,694
LAURA: Percy, where are you going?

2213
02:23:12,694 --> 02:23:14,838
TALIESIN: Just trying to--

2214
02:23:14,884 --> 02:23:19,317
MARISHA: Did you notice no one here makes eye
contact with you? It's really weird.

2215
02:23:19,317 --> 02:23:21,276
TALIESIN: Well, they did.

2216
02:23:21,276 --> 02:23:25,533
LAURA: I follow in the general direction of those
people that walked off.

2217
02:23:25,533 --> 02:23:28,650
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to head toward the
tieflings as well. Which I think is the same

2218
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:30,423
direction anyway, so.

2219
02:23:30,423 --> 02:23:40,320
MATT: Yeah. As you are following from a distance
these two humans, the two tieflings that were

2220
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:46,885
conversing split off. One walks across the way and
vanishes into an alley. The other one joins, not

2221
02:23:46,885 --> 02:23:51,797
the humans, but seems to be walking in the same
direction if maybe about 20 or so

2222
02:23:51,797 --> 02:23:54,681
feet ahead of them.

2223
02:23:54,681 --> 02:24:02,539
MARISHA: As we walk a little bit, I just want to
covertly heat up my hands, light them up a little

2224
02:24:02,539 --> 02:24:16,085
bit and then touch the wall to see if it burns me
as well a little bit. Just graze my fingers along it.

2225
02:24:16,085 --> 02:24:20,526
MATT: The flames that you create from your hand
are magically produced and insulated from your

2226
02:24:20,526 --> 02:24:26,960
body because you are the source of their magic by the
blessing of the emberstone that you struck. It

2227
02:24:27,142 --> 02:24:30,548
does not unfortunately protect you from the
searing heat from the building as you reach out.

2228
02:24:30,548 --> 02:24:33,579
(sizzle) You immediately take four points of fire
damage.

2229
02:24:33,579 --> 02:24:37,208
MARISHA: Even though my mantle of the tempest, I
ignore extreme heat?

2230
02:24:37,208 --> 02:24:43,830
MATT: You do ignore extreme heat from a general
air, like being on a desert. It doesn't prevent

2231
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:46,288
you from touching a fire and burning your hands.

2232
02:24:46,288 --> 02:24:48,779
MARISHA: It's what I was curious about.

2233
02:24:48,779 --> 02:24:51,831
LIAM: Stove. Stove. Stove! Stove! Ahh!

2234
02:24:51,831 --> 02:24:55,733
MARISHA: S'good, s'good. It feels good. It feels
good. Stove cat.

2235
02:24:55,733 --> 02:24:57,556
TALIESIN: Stove cat.

2236
02:24:57,556 --> 02:25:05,491
MATT: Some of the rolling clouds, you hear a
distant clap of thunder roll through the vicinity

2237
02:25:05,491 --> 02:25:11,831
as the occasional flashes of bluish-white and
green ash clouds on top of you.

2238
02:25:11,831 --> 02:25:15,632
LIAM: Those humans are both gone,
out of sight?

2239
02:25:15,632 --> 02:25:18,870
MATT: No, they're still in sight, you guys are
slowly following from a distance.

2240
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:21,848
LAURA: You said they split off? They split away
from each other?

2241
02:25:21,927 --> 02:25:25,346
MATT: The humans kept going. The tieflings that he
was following, there were two of them that were

2242
02:25:25,346 --> 02:25:30,378
loosely stepping in, they split off. One vanished
into an alley, the other began walking

2243
02:25:30,378 --> 02:25:31,754
in the same direction.

2244
02:25:31,754 --> 02:25:34,161
LIAM: Do we talk to this guy? Because I'm about
to. We're fucking dicking around, here.

2245
02:25:34,161 --> 02:25:38,823
TALIESIN: I'm just going to ask somebody where to
find a pub or an inn. Not trying to be coy. Not

2246
02:25:38,823 --> 02:25:40,319
trying to be interesting.

2247
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:42,609
LIAM: We can't pretend shit here. Let's just go
talk to them.

2248
02:25:42,609 --> 02:25:44,398
MARISHA: Wait, are we interesting?

2249
02:25:44,398 --> 02:25:45,709
TALIESIN: Yes, we are interesting.

2250
02:25:45,709 --> 02:25:46,995
MARISHA: Oh!

2251
02:25:46,995 --> 02:25:54,802
MATT: You watch as three different flying imp-like
creatures suddenly dart off the nearby buildings

2252
02:25:54,802 --> 02:26:02,128
and dart past you, and you watch as the two humans
stop and drag themselves off to the side. The

2253
02:26:02,128 --> 02:26:08,653
tiefling that was walking not far ahead of them
takes a few steps back and waits patiently. As you

2254
02:26:08,653 --> 02:26:22,656
watch, stepping through one of the adjacent
roadways, about three or four small devils that

2255
02:26:22,656 --> 02:26:29,320
have these barbed spines that stick out of their
body in all directions come walking through,

2256
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:31,122
carrying these little spears.

2257
02:26:31,122 --> 02:26:32,476
LAURA: We step off to the side.

2258
02:26:32,476 --> 02:26:34,438
TALIESIN: I push everybody to the side and down.

2259
02:26:34,438 --> 02:26:45,580
MATT: As a procession behind them you see a
familiar creature. You see a massive, rippling

2260
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:51,142
red-muscled pit fiend come stepping through.

2261
02:26:51,142 --> 02:26:52,727
MARISHA: Oh no!

2262
02:26:52,727 --> 02:26:54,316
LAURA: Not the one! Not that one!

2263
02:26:54,316 --> 02:26:55,771
MARISHA: It's not the same one?

2264
02:26:55,771 --> 02:26:57,587
TRAVIS: He said a familiar creature.

2265
02:26:57,587 --> 02:26:59,634
MATT: And the creature is familiar. You're not--

2266
02:26:59,634 --> 02:27:02,523
LAURA: It doesn't mean it's <i>the</i> pit fiend.

2267
02:27:02,523 --> 02:27:09,267
MATT: But you see it begins lurching through the
street, strolling like it's walking with purpose

2268
02:27:09,267 --> 02:27:15,035
to whatever business destination it has. But it
has an entourage around it of lesser demons that

2269
02:27:15,035 --> 02:27:21,572
are all clearing the street as it walks. You see
the respect that a creature of this strength has

2270
02:27:21,572 --> 02:27:32,905
even within the center of this sphere of hell.
Behind it, you see a very large orb, about ten

2271
02:27:32,905 --> 02:27:39,938
feet in diameter. It's a glistening, golden glass
and on the inside, it seems to have what look to

2272
02:27:39,938 --> 02:27:44,780
be almost a hundred different screaming faces
pressed against it from the inside that are

2273
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:52,358
merging and swirling. As it's being pulled by
these lesser demons behind it, the pit fiend's

2274
02:27:52,358 --> 02:27:59,777
just walking like it's the middle of its work day.
As it crosses the path, the demons and the cart

2275
02:27:59,777 --> 02:28:08,534
continue past out of view, and eventually the
various entities walking the street before pick up

2276
02:28:08,534 --> 02:28:11,485
their pace and continue on like nothing happened.

2277
02:28:11,485 --> 02:28:13,975
TALIESIN: I kind of like it here.

2278
02:28:13,975 --> 02:28:21,218
MARISHA: I subtly, as he goes by, study and
examine what he looks like, the pit fiend.

2279
02:28:21,218 --> 02:28:33,966
MATT: It's very similar in size and shape, design,
musculature as the one you battled in the City of

2280
02:28:33,966 --> 02:28:40,896
Brass. There are a couple of pretty
quick-to-pick-out marks and changes in the bony

2281
02:28:40,896 --> 02:28:47,010
crest and horns on its head, and the coloration on
its wings go to a dark, deep purple as opposed to

2282
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:58,248
the bright, vibrant red of the last one. So, it is
a different entity than the one you battled. You

2283
02:28:58,248 --> 02:29:01,984
continue walking and you're starting to notice, as
you follow these people forward, that the further

2284
02:29:01,984 --> 02:29:07,871
you walk in this path, and already the sides of
the alleys and street corners and such were pretty

2285
02:29:07,871 --> 02:29:13,451
littered with broken refuse pushed into the
corners, but the further you step into this, the

2286
02:29:13,451 --> 02:29:23,439
more and more destitute and filthy the city seems
to become. You begin to see more and more lesser

2287
02:29:23,439 --> 02:29:32,865
demons just sitting off to the side, just lazily
looking around for some sort of impulse to kick

2288
02:29:32,865 --> 02:29:38,854
in, and grab something that's dangling from the
bottom of whatever food chain exists here. You see

2289
02:29:38,854 --> 02:29:45,597
more lemures that are in the process of being
grabbed and fought over, that have just dwindled

2290
02:29:45,597 --> 02:29:54,227
over time, like their fleshy, tortured soul mass
has been abused and slowly disintegrated and has

2291
02:29:54,227 --> 02:30:02,114
been left to be fought over by whatever exists in
this area. The buildings themselves begin becoming

2292
02:30:02,114 --> 02:30:12,949
less these large monolithic towers of black iron
and more resembling sagging, stone-like swamp

2293
02:30:13,123 --> 02:30:18,546
structures that have a blackish-purple moss that
seems to seep from the side; the air almost

2294
02:30:18,546 --> 02:30:23,558
becomes more humid with the heat as you pass
through. The streets are becoming far more dense.

2295
02:30:23,558 --> 02:30:32,699
You are seeing more humanoids of different races,
you're seeing more of the lesser devils coalescing

2296
02:30:32,699 --> 02:30:38,830
in these center spaces, and you do see what
appears to be some semblance of what you would

2297
02:30:38,830 --> 02:30:45,135
call a devilish tavern. There is no music, there
is no lively chatter, but you do see what looks to

2298
02:30:45,135 --> 02:30:54,958
be chairs, you look to see what seems to be a
common area where some entities are sitting and

2299
02:30:54,958 --> 02:30:59,470
partaking in food of some kind.

2300
02:30:59,470 --> 02:31:05,766
MARISHA: As we move through the streets, I just
want to trail behind Vax and take a look at if

2301
02:31:05,766 --> 02:31:12,684
anyone's reacting to him unusually, or taking
notice of him.

2302
02:31:12,684 --> 02:31:16,148
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check

2303
02:31:16,148 --> 02:31:22,704
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Okay, yeah, 24.

2304
02:31:22,907 --> 02:31:24,415
MATT: Okay.

2305
02:31:24,415 --> 02:31:28,067
MARISHA: It's all right, it's all right.

2306
02:31:28,067 --> 02:31:39,225
MATT: As you're keeping an eye out, the gleaming
bright albino tiefling does seem to, at least,

2307
02:31:39,225 --> 02:31:47,385
have caught the eye of a handful of humanoid-- it
looks like humans, you see they're trailing behind

2308
02:31:47,385 --> 02:31:49,735
you by a good hundred or so feet--

2309
02:31:49,735 --> 02:31:50,701
MARISHA: They are following us?

2310
02:31:50,701 --> 02:32:02,328
MATT: -- but they appear to be following you. One
appears to be a-- it looks dwarvish in how stout

2311
02:32:02,328 --> 02:32:11,556
it is, but it's hard to tell at this distance, and
the humanoid creature to the right of it is

2312
02:32:11,556 --> 02:32:19,635
human-sized, but it is wrapped in a wreath of dark
chains that seem to cover most features, the face

2313
02:32:19,635 --> 02:32:26,928
and the torso. You can see bits of skin and muscle
peeking through, but it's just an entire robe of

2314
02:32:26,928 --> 02:32:31,885
very tightly-wound chains, just massed around its
torso and legs and arms.

2315
02:32:31,885 --> 02:32:33,437
LAURA: Ugh, this is like Hellraiser!

2316
02:32:33,437 --> 02:32:35,281
TALIESIN: I was having a Hellraiser moment.

2317
02:32:35,281 --> 02:32:37,039
LIAM: Perfectly healthy, perfectly normal.

2318
02:32:37,039 --> 02:32:40,463
MARISHA: Does he seem to be following slightly
behind in step of the

2319
02:32:40,463 --> 02:32:42,717
dwarvish-maybe-creature?

2320
02:32:42,781 --> 02:32:45,298
MATT: They're staying in step with each other, but
you--

2321
02:32:45,298 --> 02:32:46,747
LAURA: Oh, it's a buddy movie!

2322
02:32:46,747 --> 02:32:48,160
MARISHA: Yeah, buddy cop?

2323
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:49,879
LIAM: It's like Fox and the Hound.

2324
02:32:49,879 --> 02:32:54,068
MATT: But they're both very directly fixed and
have been for a little while, on the white

2325
02:32:54,068 --> 02:32:55,570
tiefling that has just walked by.

2326
02:32:55,570 --> 02:32:57,745
LIAM: How far is this tavern from us?

2327
02:32:57,745 --> 02:33:01,940
MATT: When you notice it at this point, as you're
walking actually forward, it's about 30 feet off.

2328
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:11,890
MARISHA: I come over the comms and I say, hey,
Vaxy-poo, I think we're being followed, I kind of

2329
02:33:11,890 --> 02:33:14,805
feel like they can smell you.

2330
02:33:14,805 --> 02:33:16,849
LIAM: Me specifically?

2331
02:33:16,849 --> 02:33:22,531
LAURA: Well, you are quite lovely, brother. Into
the tavern? It's up ahead.

2332
02:33:22,531 --> 02:33:23,708
TALIESIN: Into the tavern.

2333
02:33:23,708 --> 02:33:29,837
MARISHA: Keep an eye out, it's like a kind of
stout, maybe dwarvish man and a humanoid creature

2334
02:33:29,837 --> 02:33:31,278
covered in chains.

2335
02:33:31,278 --> 02:33:34,579
LAURA: I glance back and see them.

2336
02:33:34,579 --> 02:33:37,753
LIAM: Thank you for the heads-up, I'm going to go
in.

2337
02:33:37,753 --> 02:33:42,319
LAURA: Yeah. I stand outside the tavern with Grog
and wait for everybody to get inside.

2338
02:33:42,319 --> 02:33:43,341
MATT: Okay.

2339
02:33:43,341 --> 02:33:45,039
TALIESIN: I go stepping inside the tavern.

2340
02:33:45,039 --> 02:33:47,240
MARISHA: I slip inside as well.

2341
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:56,470
MATT: Okay, as you guys, and Taryon follows suit.
"Ah, Doty, do whatever he does." He points to

2342
02:33:56,470 --> 02:33:59,668
Grog. Doty steps next to you.

2343
02:33:59,668 --> 02:34:01,969
LIAM: What a setup.

2344
02:34:01,969 --> 02:34:08,172
(laughter)

2345
02:34:16,781 --> 02:34:27,645
MATT: As you guys enter, the low-burning,
orangish-red glow of the interior shows you a slab

2346
02:34:27,802 --> 02:34:37,523
slate floor. Across you see tables that are carved
from similar deep obsidian bedrock-type material.

2347
02:34:37,523 --> 02:34:43,874
The edges of them almost hook upward, and within
the inside, you can see a handful of these similar

2348
02:34:43,874 --> 02:34:48,612
spined devils, that you've seen as part of that
procession earlier with the pit fiend, are sitting

2349
02:34:48,612 --> 02:34:54,757
and ravenously feasting on some nondescript
purplish-red meat. You can see the tables,

2350
02:34:54,757 --> 02:34:59,922
actually, are almost like troughs, and the center
of it seems to be almost a funnel, where all the

2351
02:34:59,922 --> 02:35:01,565
blood and gore that is--

2352
02:35:01,565 --> 02:35:03,101
LAURA: Ohh-- (shuddering noise)

2353
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:08,835
MATT: -- sent out from the viscera that slurps
past their toothy maw, is gathered and then

2354
02:35:08,835 --> 02:35:10,936
siphoned down below.

2355
02:35:10,936 --> 02:35:17,087
LIAM: Out of curiosity, these spined devils look
like the thing we fought under Krieg's house. Was

2356
02:35:17,087 --> 02:35:18,798
that Krieg's house? It was, wasn't it?

2357
02:35:18,798 --> 02:35:19,795
LAURA: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

2358
02:35:19,795 --> 02:35:20,961
LIAM: With the succubus.

2359
02:35:20,961 --> 02:35:23,164
LAURA: Should we-- I just walk up. I'm just going
to ask for a room, and just go up.

2360
02:35:23,164 --> 02:35:25,641
MATT: I can show pictures of all these creatures,
it's great!

2361
02:35:25,641 --> 02:35:28,975
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay downstairs to see if
they try and come in.

2362
02:35:28,975 --> 02:35:30,764
LIAM: Is there a bar here?

2363
02:35:30,764 --> 02:35:32,493
TRAVIS: We're still outside.

2364
02:35:32,493 --> 02:35:37,202
MATT: There is the ones that are currently
feasting at the one table there.

2365
02:35:37,202 --> 02:35:38,051
LAURA: Oh my god.

2366
02:35:38,051 --> 02:35:41,203
LIAM: Is there the hellish equivalent of a bar
here?

2367
02:35:41,203 --> 02:35:46,730
MATT: You glance-- that's one table there; there's
another table where you can see what looks to be a

2368
02:35:46,730 --> 02:35:59,786
deep-red-skinned, very handsome-looking man who
has black hair that fades to a very faint grey at

2369
02:35:59,786 --> 02:36:03,952
the tips; it's long and goes past the shoulders.
He has horns that protrude up the front, he's--

2370
02:36:03,952 --> 02:36:09,583
the rest of his body is swathed in dark black and
grey cloak, and you can see wings folded against

2371
02:36:09,583 --> 02:36:13,577
his back, and he just sits there, clutching a
goblet at the table, usually staring into it as he

2372
02:36:13,577 --> 02:36:20,180
occasionally sips, lost in his own thought. Beyond
that, in the corner, you do see sitting--

2373
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:21,922
MARISHA: Me at 1 AM.

2374
02:36:21,922 --> 02:36:36,698
MATT: A rather rotund-- He's a greasy,
obese-looking fella who's been-- he has a big and

2375
02:36:36,698 --> 02:36:46,621
matted brown beard. His hair has this curl and he
has a whole series of scratch marks across his

2376
02:36:46,621 --> 02:36:56,099
face that just-- long, deep-set scars that leave
this very marred visage, and he grins this toothy

2377
02:36:56,099 --> 02:37:02,492
grin as you enter. You can see he's just-- his
chest hair that's exposed under his white tunic,

2378
02:37:02,492 --> 02:37:10,376
and his leather apron that he has over the front
of that. It's just a very, very disturbing grin

2379
02:37:10,376 --> 02:37:15,206
when he smiles at you as you enter, and he sits up
from his stool and walks over and puts his hands

2380
02:37:15,206 --> 02:37:19,076
down, and as it puts its hands down, you can see
them begin to burn his skin but you can now see

2381
02:37:19,076 --> 02:37:23,806
these calloused fingers-- you can see he's been
here for quite some time and has had his own way

2382
02:37:23,806 --> 02:37:31,162
of adjusting to the atmosphere, and just leans in,
(speaks Infernal).

2383
02:37:31,162 --> 02:37:32,759
LAURA: Kuthok.

2384
02:37:32,759 --> 02:37:33,968
MATT: "Kuthok."

2385
02:37:33,968 --> 02:37:34,918
TALIESIN: Common?

2386
02:37:34,918 --> 02:37:36,827
LAURA: Rooms.

2387
02:37:36,827 --> 02:37:40,861
MATT: "Ah, you aren't from around here. (laughs)"

2388
02:37:40,861 --> 02:37:43,453
TALIESIN: Certainly not.

2389
02:37:43,453 --> 02:37:47,183
MARISHA: Ermahgerd. Ermahgerd?

2390
02:37:47,183 --> 02:37:48,615
TALIESIN: Ermahgod.

2391
02:37:48,615 --> 02:37:49,837
MARISHA: Ermahgerd.

2392
02:37:49,837 --> 02:37:57,608
MATT: As you say that, the devilish entity that
was sitting at the table slowly turns its head

2393
02:37:57,608 --> 02:37:58,841
over towards her--

2394
02:37:58,841 --> 02:38:02,454
(laughter)

2395
02:38:02,454 --> 02:38:06,095
MATT: -- and has now taken an interest in this
group that has entered--

2396
02:38:06,095 --> 02:38:06,956
TRAVIS: Slick!

2397
02:38:06,956 --> 02:38:08,445
MATT: -- sipping his wine.

2398
02:38:08,445 --> 02:38:13,397
MARISHA: I look back at him and I light up my
fingers and I give him the flaming finger guns.

2399
02:38:13,397 --> 02:38:17,574
Super douchey.

2400
02:38:17,574 --> 02:38:19,785
MATT: He gives a nod.

2401
02:38:19,785 --> 02:38:23,374
MARISHA: Over-exaggerated nod.

2402
02:38:23,374 --> 02:38:26,211
TRAVIS: He's literally eating raw meat and blood.

2403
02:38:26,211 --> 02:38:28,371
LAURA: No more, Keyleth. No more eye contact.

2404
02:38:28,371 --> 02:38:32,989
MATT: Well, he just has a goblet, but you don't
know what's in it.

2405
02:38:32,989 --> 02:38:35,223
LAURA: Do you have rooms available?

2406
02:38:35,223 --> 02:38:41,282
MATT: "We can provide space, yes."

2407
02:38:41,282 --> 02:38:51,921
TALIESIN: We're here on a few days' business and
we were hoping to find a friendly place to rest

2408
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:58,276
our heads on occasion, maybe take in a meal of
something not necessarily--

2409
02:38:58,276 --> 02:38:59,613
LAURA: Organ?

2410
02:38:59,613 --> 02:39:01,058
TALIESIN: Too conscious?

2411
02:39:01,058 --> 02:39:02,370
MARISHA: Too conscious? (laughs)

2412
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:12,605
MATT: He leans in and goes, "I can provide that,
don't worry. How're you paying?"

2413
02:39:12,605 --> 02:39:14,622
TALIESIN: Will coin suffice?

2414
02:39:14,622 --> 02:39:17,456
MATT: "I suppose."

2415
02:39:17,456 --> 02:39:22,987
TALIESIN: If we get anything more exciting, we'll
be sure to let you know. We just got here.

2416
02:39:22,987 --> 02:39:27,810
MATT: "One room," and he puts up a thick, meaty
finger that you can see has-- it's been broken in

2417
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:30,046
two places and not healed right.

2418
02:39:30,046 --> 02:39:33,050
TALIESIN: Oh god, stop it, Matt! Ugh.

2419
02:39:33,050 --> 02:39:50,745
MATT: "Three rooms, and a special meal for the
lot. 250 gold."

2420
02:39:50,745 --> 02:39:57,220
MARISHA: Wow, wow, vacation destination right
here.

2421
02:39:57,220 --> 02:39:59,368
TALIESIN: I'm totally okay with that.

2422
02:39:59,368 --> 02:40:02,756
LIAM: Yeah, it's airport prices.

2423
02:40:02,874 --> 02:40:05,707
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, it doesn't really matter
what we think about that price.

2424
02:40:05,707 --> 02:40:11,249
TALIESIN: You, sir, is that 250 a night or 250
total for our stay?

2425
02:40:11,249 --> 02:40:21,529
MATT: He gives you all a really dark look. "We'll
say for the stay. A few days, you said, right?"

2426
02:40:21,529 --> 02:40:32,237
TALIESIN: For that, 350 I think. I feel that I
want you to know just how grateful we are. I'll

2427
02:40:32,237 --> 02:40:35,704
put the extra 100 out of my personal bin.

2428
02:40:35,704 --> 02:40:39,400
MATT: You can see he's looking at you as you're
saying this, and he's contemplating. You can see

2429
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:47,726
there's that urge to jack it up. But he keeps
glancing past you occasionally and just nods and

2430
02:40:47,726 --> 02:40:49,917
accepts it.

2431
02:40:49,917 --> 02:40:51,271
MARISHA: Do I notice this?

2432
02:40:51,271 --> 02:40:58,412
LAURA: As he's talking, I turn around and lean
against the table that he's talking over and see

2433
02:40:58,412 --> 02:40:59,880
who he's looking at.

2434
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:00,936
MATT: Okay.

2435
02:41:00,936 --> 02:41:01,871
TRAVIS: Does that burn you?

2436
02:41:01,871 --> 02:41:02,827
MATT: You take five points of fire damage.

2437
02:41:02,827 --> 02:41:05,702
LAURA: Well yeah, but I'm going to act totally
calm about it.

2438
02:41:05,702 --> 02:41:11,910
MATT: You glance, watching his eyeline and you can
see that same dark red-skinned devilish-looking

2439
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:17,202
man who was paying attention to you all is
currently meeting his gaze directly and gives him

2440
02:41:17,202 --> 02:41:18,761
a nod.

2441
02:41:18,761 --> 02:41:23,608
MARISHA: Oh, no no no! This ain't no Hostel
situation! Aw, hell no.

2442
02:41:23,608 --> 02:41:26,052
LAURA: I think he might be the owner.

2443
02:41:26,052 --> 02:41:34,536
MARISHA: That makes sense-- but still, still, no.
No, we're not going to go in here to be sold in

2444
02:41:34,536 --> 02:41:36,257
the middle of the night.

2445
02:41:36,257 --> 02:41:37,876
TALIESIN: We're good, we're good.

2446
02:41:37,876 --> 02:41:38,947
MARISHA: Are we cool?

2447
02:41:38,947 --> 02:41:41,181
TALIESIN: I think we're cool. Just let it play
out.

2448
02:41:41,181 --> 02:41:44,617
LAURA: Can we insight check the guy we're talking
to?

2449
02:41:44,617 --> 02:41:46,188
MATT: Sure, go for it.

2450
02:41:46,188 --> 02:41:55,442
LAURA: Okay. Sure, why not! Here we go. Yeah, yeah
that's good. 17.

2451
02:41:55,442 --> 02:42:06,551
MATT: 17? I mean, he's hard to read, but he seems
to be a pretty fucking creepy guy who's giving you

2452
02:42:06,551 --> 02:42:13,930
rooms to stay in, and seems to be making eye
contact and his reactions based on some sort of

2453
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:20,660
unspoken conversation with this other entity in
the room with you. But he reaches down without

2454
02:42:20,660 --> 02:42:25,654
breaking eye contact with the rest of you as well
and puts a set of three keys onto the table.

2455
02:42:25,654 --> 02:42:31,925
They're all these ragged-looking black iron
constructs that are identical in some ways but

2456
02:42:31,925 --> 02:42:40,170
their handcrafted visual style shows that they
have different slight changes to their designs.

2457
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:46,893
Kind of shoves them forward towards you.
"Premium." And he reaches down. You hear the

2458
02:42:46,893 --> 02:42:54,551
clanking of some sort of glass-like instruments
and he pulls up these small, almost dull

2459
02:42:54,551 --> 02:43:01,155
gray-looking sponge-like stones that are about
that large. Kind of puts one out in front of each

2460
02:43:01,155 --> 02:43:11,613
of you. Takes the coins. (sighs) Goes and walks
back--

2461
02:43:11,613 --> 02:43:15,679
LAURA: Wait, before he walks away. How long have
you owned this space?

2462
02:43:15,679 --> 02:43:20,934
MATT: "Oh, I don't own it. I just work here."

2463
02:43:20,934 --> 02:43:24,085
LAURA: Who runs it, then?

2464
02:43:24,085 --> 02:43:29,610
MATT: "Why you asking so many questions, girl?"

2465
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:33,809
LAURA: I'm curious, big man. That's all.

2466
02:43:33,809 --> 02:43:36,597
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2467
02:43:36,597 --> 02:43:42,427
LAURA: (squeaking noises) 18.

2468
02:43:42,427 --> 02:43:46,107
LIAM: She said with confidence.

2469
02:43:46,107 --> 02:43:58,703
MATT: "That's on a need-to-know basis, sweetheart.
Enjoy your meal." He goes and like sweatily

2470
02:43:58,703 --> 02:44:02,758
waddles over to his chair in the corner and sits
down.

2471
02:44:02,758 --> 02:44:10,541
MARISHA: Is this rock tartare? Oh my god. We used
to serve this all the time in the Air Ashari. It

2472
02:44:10,541 --> 02:44:13,108
was a delicacy in the Earth Ashari.

2473
02:44:13,108 --> 02:44:17,514
MATT: As you lift it and bring it towards you, it
seems to have this very, very

2474
02:44:17,514 --> 02:44:20,691
faint energy around it.

2475
02:44:20,691 --> 02:44:24,902
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know if this is rock crudite.

2476
02:44:24,935 --> 02:44:29,276
LAURA: Let's get up to the rooms. I want Tary to
identify it once we get up to the rooms.

2477
02:44:29,276 --> 02:44:31,502
MARISHA: I kind of do like a--

2478
02:44:31,502 --> 02:44:34,627
LAURA: Don't, don't. Not yet, Keyleth.

2479
02:44:34,627 --> 02:44:40,917
MATT: Keyleth, as you tap it and bring it towards
your mouth, you guys watch as it glows with a

2480
02:44:40,917 --> 02:44:53,684
faint pale yellow-green color and, Keyleth, you
hear this faint soft, wailing sound as this slight

2481
02:44:53,684 --> 02:44:59,481
drift of soul energy drifts off of the stone and
is inhaled by Keyleth.

2482
02:44:59,481 --> 02:45:00,377
MARISHA: Oh.

2483
02:45:00,377 --> 02:45:03,510
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughs)

2484
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:06,274
MATT: Keyleth, you feel a sudden rush--

2485
02:45:06,274 --> 02:45:08,199
TRAVIS: Of course!

2486
02:45:08,199 --> 02:45:12,042
MATT: An unexpected rush of energy. Your vision
clarifies--

2487
02:45:12,042 --> 02:45:13,837
LIAM: Give it to Keyleth, she'll try anything!

2488
02:45:14,003 --> 02:45:15,338
(laughter)

2489
02:45:15,338 --> 02:45:17,188
LAURA: You ate a soul, Keyleth?!

2490
02:45:17,188 --> 02:45:21,062
TALIESIN: That had a name! That had a life, that
had a mortgage.

2491
02:45:21,062 --> 02:45:23,779
LAURA: Oh my god!

2492
02:45:23,779 --> 02:45:28,491
TALIESIN: He made some bad decisions, and now
you're eating it--

2493
02:45:28,491 --> 02:45:30,790
MATT: A sudden rush of energy--

2494
02:45:30,790 --> 02:45:33,389
MARISHA: It's so Keyleth, yeah. Oh shit.

2495
02:45:33,389 --> 02:45:36,413
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

2496
02:45:36,413 --> 02:45:46,843
MATT: You feel very awake. Your senses clarify and
like a boundless surge of energy in your body,

2497
02:45:46,843 --> 02:45:48,484
like you could do anything.

2498
02:45:48,484 --> 02:45:53,929
MARISHA: (exhales) Do we-- are we resting right
now? Let's go right now.

2499
02:45:53,929 --> 02:45:57,236
LAURA: Let's go up to the room.

2500
02:45:57,236 --> 02:45:58,615
LIAM: You okay over there?

2501
02:45:58,615 --> 02:46:02,905
MARISHA: This is like the best rock tartare I
think I've ever experienced.

2502
02:46:02,905 --> 02:46:05,607
MATT: Tary, by the way, goes--

2503
02:46:05,607 --> 02:46:06,966
LAURA: No, no, Tary!

2504
02:46:06,966 --> 02:46:14,132
MATT: Like sucking hard on the stone. And you
watch as the hairs on the back of his neck stand

2505
02:46:14,132 --> 02:46:20,113
and he goes, "Good sir. How much are each of
these?"

2506
02:46:20,113 --> 02:46:22,834
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

2507
02:46:22,834 --> 02:46:27,105
LIAM: I'm quietly thinking about Scanlan, watching
this happen.

2508
02:46:27,105 --> 02:46:34,014
MATT: The guy sits forward and goes, "For you? 30
gold apiece."

2509
02:46:34,014 --> 02:46:35,331
MARISHA: Taryon--

2510
02:46:35,331 --> 02:46:37,367
MATT: Tary goes, "I'll take 20."

2511
02:46:37,367 --> 02:46:44,724
MARISHA: Buy the lot, Tary! Buy the lot! Good man!
And I like Beastman shake him. Yeah!

2512
02:46:44,724 --> 02:46:46,331
LIAM: Are you okay?

2513
02:46:46,331 --> 02:46:48,157
MARISHA: I'm great! I feel great.

2514
02:46:48,157 --> 02:46:49,776
LAURA: Let's go upstairs.

2515
02:46:49,776 --> 02:46:52,310
TRAVIS: We got one left, let's take it upstairs.

2516
02:46:52,310 --> 02:46:54,979
LAURA: No, we've got one for each of us.

2517
02:46:54,979 --> 02:46:56,288
TRAVIS: He said three of them.

2518
02:46:56,288 --> 02:46:57,629
TALIESIN: Three rooms.

2519
02:46:57,629 --> 02:47:05,493
MATT: So Sam, mark 600 gold and wherever you are,
Sam, mark down 20 soul stone slivers.

2520
02:47:05,493 --> 02:47:08,009
LIAM: Welcome to Hollywood.

2521
02:47:08,009 --> 02:47:10,452
MARISHA: They're soul stone slivers?

2522
02:47:10,452 --> 02:47:11,266
MATT: Yes.

2523
02:47:11,266 --> 02:47:15,388
MARISHA: That's what they're fucking called?
That's some-- man. You need to put

2524
02:47:15,388 --> 02:47:17,291
a disclaimer on those.

2525
02:47:17,291 --> 02:47:19,768
LIAM: Let's get to the rooms, shall we?

2526
02:47:19,768 --> 02:47:24,462
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted. Yeah, let's
go to the rooms.

2527
02:47:24,462 --> 02:47:32,466
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up to the
chambers, and to your surprise, the interior of

2528
02:47:32,466 --> 02:47:38,108
these rooms are fairly well furnished. While the
entrance chamber seemed to be pretty brutal, the

2529
02:47:38,108 --> 02:47:42,189
chambers that you were given-- they aren't next to
each other. They're a little scattered as far as

2530
02:47:42,189 --> 02:47:48,208
the rooms. Only maybe ten or so rooms in the whole
establishment. But each room has a very

2531
02:47:48,208 --> 02:47:56,733
well-crafted bed. There appear to be some
well-made chairs of a similar stone material of

2532
02:47:56,733 --> 02:48:06,877
the downstairs setup there, all having this weird,
jagged stylings to their construct. The chamber's

2533
02:48:06,877 --> 02:48:12,214
still hot as fuck, and it is an uncomfortable
interior, but the bed itself does not appear to be

2534
02:48:12,214 --> 02:48:16,851
bursting into flames. The material here is
seemingly resistant to the heat in which it's in

2535
02:48:16,851 --> 02:48:18,033
the proximity of.

2536
02:48:18,033 --> 02:48:19,736
LIAM: No, it's just a bed in New York City in
July.

2537
02:48:19,736 --> 02:48:23,049
LAURA: I open up the bag of colding and just like
put my face next to it.

2538
02:48:23,049 --> 02:48:24,226
TALIESIN: Don't fall in.

2539
02:48:24,226 --> 02:48:26,857
LAURA: No, I just want to breathe in the cold.

2540
02:48:26,857 --> 02:48:30,416
TALIESIN: Don't lick it, either.

2541
02:48:30,416 --> 02:48:33,879
LAURA: Wait, should we all go to one room, then?

2542
02:48:33,879 --> 02:48:35,369
LIAM: Yeah.

2543
02:48:35,369 --> 02:48:39,535
LAURA: And I want to look all around the room and
see if anybody's watching, if there's any kind of

2544
02:48:39,535 --> 02:48:40,954
holes in the wall.

2545
02:48:40,954 --> 02:48:44,380
LIAM: Yeah, is there any kind of bugs or
any-- bugs.

2546
02:48:44,448 --> 02:48:46,926
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2547
02:48:46,926 --> 02:48:49,783
TALIESIN: Bugs or bugs. I cast black light.

2548
02:48:49,783 --> 02:48:52,859
MARISHA: Bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs-- I cast
black light!

2549
02:48:52,859 --> 02:48:54,452
LAURA: 13.

2550
02:48:54,452 --> 02:48:55,977
LIAM: 18.

2551
02:48:55,977 --> 02:49:03,151
MATT: Cool. So as you guys take a good ten minutes
or so. As you're looking over the room, everyone's

2552
02:49:03,151 --> 02:49:05,450
Alter Selves except for Keyleth's fade.

2553
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:07,470
LAURA: Yeah, we were close there.

2554
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:12,350
MATT: You guys were very close. But you glance
around the room and it seems safe. You don't see

2555
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:15,961
any sort of signs of any spying.

2556
02:49:15,961 --> 02:49:19,905
MARISHA: Tary. You look like yourself again.

2557
02:49:19,905 --> 02:49:23,471
MATT: "Oh, I'm about to feel a lot more like
myself here in a second." And he starts going

2558
02:49:23,471 --> 02:49:24,445
through the--

2559
02:49:24,445 --> 02:49:29,379
LAURA: Not yet. Just hold on one second. Maybe I'd
cast Identify on those, just before you eat

2560
02:49:29,379 --> 02:49:30,759
another one.

2561
02:49:30,759 --> 02:49:31,836
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

2562
02:49:31,836 --> 02:49:33,272
MATT: "Oh, right!"

2563
02:49:33,272 --> 02:49:40,449
MARISHA: Tary. Tary. There are beds. And Keyleth
goes and jumps up on a bed, and just starts

2564
02:49:40,449 --> 02:49:41,958
jumping on them a little.

2565
02:49:41,958 --> 02:49:46,385
MATT: Tary goes like-- leans into you and goes
like, "Is she hitting on me?"

2566
02:49:46,385 --> 02:49:49,281
MARISHA: As Keyleth jumps in the bed on the
background.

2567
02:49:49,281 --> 02:49:53,116
LIAM: It's hard to tell sometimes. Just go with
it. Don't make any sudden movements, and let her

2568
02:49:53,116 --> 02:49:54,740
get it out of her system.

2569
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:56,005
MATT: "Right, right."

2570
02:49:56,005 --> 02:49:58,394
MARISHA: Mattresses are springy here!

2571
02:49:58,394 --> 02:49:59,694
LAURA: Wow.

2572
02:49:59,694 --> 02:50:02,030
LIAM: What's the D&D equivalent of a glowstick?

2573
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:04,524
MATT: It'd be a Sunrod.

2574
02:50:04,524 --> 02:50:05,987
TALIESIN: That's actually true.

2575
02:50:05,987 --> 02:50:08,106
MATT: That is actually true. (laughs)

2576
02:50:08,106 --> 02:50:15,646
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently pop her in the ankle
to see if I can get her to just fall onto the bed

2577
02:50:15,646 --> 02:50:17,266
and stop hopping.

2578
02:50:17,266 --> 02:50:21,331
MATT: (falling and slamming noise) Percy just
knocks you onto your ass.

2579
02:50:21,331 --> 02:50:23,651
LAURA: Okay, Keyleth, okay.

2580
02:50:23,651 --> 02:50:30,706
MATT: By the way, the buzz, if you will, the rush
slowly begins to fade over the next minute or so.

2581
02:50:30,706 --> 02:50:38,171
Taryon finishes his Identification and goes, "Huh.
Apparently these are receptacles to contain a

2582
02:50:38,171 --> 02:50:40,879
"fragment of refined soul."

2583
02:50:40,879 --> 02:50:42,180
MARISHA: What?!

2584
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:45,092
MATT: "Yeah, these were once living people. I'm
going to be sick."

2585
02:50:45,092 --> 02:50:49,274
LIAM: I start giving Keyleth--

2586
02:50:49,274 --> 02:50:52,497
LAURA: (laughs) You just ate a person! You just
ate people.

2587
02:50:52,497 --> 02:50:54,816
MATT: "I know. I kn-- (nervous noises)"

2588
02:50:54,816 --> 02:50:56,177
MARISHA: I go with Taryon to puke.

2589
02:50:56,177 --> 02:50:59,275
LIAM: Ooh, never mind. I was going to give her a
scalp massage, but ugh.

2590
02:50:59,275 --> 02:51:01,824
TALIESIN: So does the Identification spell
actually tell you the name of the person that you

2591
02:51:01,824 --> 02:51:02,797
were consuming?

2592
02:51:02,797 --> 02:51:05,800
MATT: "Nope! And I'm glad! I don't want to-- I
didn't-- I don't-- I'm sure they were a terrible

2593
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:08,062
"person. If they're here they're probably a
terrible person. They're probably

2594
02:51:08,062 --> 02:51:09,228
"terrible people, right?!"

2595
02:51:09,228 --> 02:51:10,649
TRAVIS: How many souls did you just buy?

2596
02:51:10,649 --> 02:51:11,710
MATT: "I don't know!"

2597
02:51:11,710 --> 02:51:14,524
LAURA: (gasps) Well, it was fragments, so maybe
it's only like five souls, completely?

2598
02:51:14,524 --> 02:51:16,177
MATT: "Maybe? I don't know the logistics."

2599
02:51:16,177 --> 02:51:17,418
TRAVIS: Like a whole family.

2600
02:51:17,418 --> 02:51:20,965
LIAM: I mean, you were really up, though, when you
were, you know, full there.

2601
02:51:20,965 --> 02:51:27,029
LAURA: But does it heal you? What do the fragments
do? I mean do the soul fragments just like--

2602
02:51:27,029 --> 02:51:29,726
MARISHA: Yeah, what happened? What happened when
that happened?

2603
02:51:29,726 --> 02:51:34,724
LAURA: -- do you just feel better, are you healed
or are you just not hungry anymore?

2604
02:51:34,724 --> 02:51:35,948
TALIESIN: Sustained.

2605
02:51:35,948 --> 02:51:43,747
MATT: Sustained. I mean, as far you understand,
and from what you experienced there, any sort of

2606
02:51:43,747 --> 02:51:48,680
hunger pains that would have existed there seem to
have been staved off, and there is a--

2607
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:50,995
TALIESIN: (laughs) It's literally Soylent.

2608
02:51:50,995 --> 02:51:52,962
MARISHA: That's really messed up, because now I'm
hungry.

2609
02:51:52,962 --> 02:51:55,244
(laughter)

2610
02:51:55,244 --> 02:51:58,246
MARISHA: It's very hollow sustenance, I'm really
hungry now.

2611
02:51:58,246 --> 02:51:59,903
LAURA: Well, we're about to have a Heroes' Feast.

2612
02:51:59,903 --> 02:52:01,265
MARISHA: Oh boy.

2613
02:52:01,265 --> 02:52:02,800
TRAVIS: Back to the plan.

2614
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:04,036
LAURA: Back to the plan.

2615
02:52:04,036 --> 02:52:05,801
MARISHA: Oh god, my throat's a little tight.

2616
02:52:05,801 --> 02:52:07,373
TALIESIN: Scry. You're going to be fine after you
scry.

2617
02:52:07,373 --> 02:52:09,593
LAURA: Okay, scry. Let's scry on Hotis.

2618
02:52:09,593 --> 02:52:11,077
TRAVIS: And then the Feast?

2619
02:52:11,077 --> 02:52:14,292
TALIESIN: I'm going to give her a shot of
something, just to calm down.

2620
02:52:14,292 --> 02:52:15,627
MARISHA: Yeah, can you give me like, a minute?

2621
02:52:15,627 --> 02:52:20,699
TALIESIN: Going to give her a shot of something.
Got to go back for more, soon.

2622
02:52:20,699 --> 02:52:22,229
LIAM: Pours a soul in.

2623
02:52:22,229 --> 02:52:29,623
TALIESIN: (laughs) Certainly spirits at the very
least. Soul and spirits. I shouldn't be finding

2624
02:52:29,623 --> 02:52:31,494
this as funny as I am.

2625
02:52:31,494 --> 02:52:32,966
LIAM: Oh, it's very in-character.

2626
02:52:32,966 --> 02:52:36,433
MARISHA: Keyleth paces back and forth for about
five minutes, and then goes, okay, I'm good.

2627
02:52:36,433 --> 02:52:37,807
LAURA: Let it settle.

2628
02:52:37,807 --> 02:52:41,603
MARISHA: I'm great. Okay.

2629
02:52:41,603 --> 02:52:45,815
LAURA: Grog, do you want to keep leaning against
the door, maybe? I'm just afraid-- I feel really

2630
02:52:45,815 --> 02:52:48,601
uncomfortable in here. Are there windows in the
room at all?

2631
02:52:48,601 --> 02:52:49,684
MATT: Nope.

2632
02:52:49,684 --> 02:52:50,535
LAURA: Okay.

2633
02:52:50,535 --> 02:52:52,775
TRAVIS: Can I touch the door with my pointy finger
real quick?

2634
02:52:52,775 --> 02:52:53,893
MATT: Yes, you do.

2635
02:52:53,893 --> 02:52:54,825
TRAVIS: Is it burny?

2636
02:52:54,825 --> 02:52:55,869
MATT: It is.

2637
02:52:55,869 --> 02:52:57,756
LAURA: Maybe Doty can lean against the door? Stand
in front of the--

2638
02:52:57,756 --> 02:53:00,873
LIAM: Hey yeah, Tarytown, can you have Dotes lean
on the door?

2639
02:53:00,873 --> 02:53:07,668
MATT: Which, by the way, as Grog does that, Doty
goes-- into the door, and Taryon's like, "Oh,

2640
02:53:07,668 --> 02:53:12,120
"Doty, you can stop doing that, but do lean against
the door."

2641
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:15,591
LAURA: Does he take fire damage?

2642
02:53:15,591 --> 02:53:17,848
MATT: Doesn't appear to be affecting him.

2643
02:53:17,848 --> 02:53:19,194
LAURA: Okay.

2644
02:53:19,194 --> 02:53:22,351
MATT: Though, over the next minute or so, you see
parts of the back of his armor begin to glow a

2645
02:53:22,351 --> 02:53:27,025
dull red to match the coloration of the edges of
the buildings.

2646
02:53:27,025 --> 02:53:28,913
LAURA: Oh shit, that's kind of cool.

2647
02:53:28,913 --> 02:53:30,347
MARISHA: That's pretty cool, yeah.

2648
02:53:30,347 --> 02:53:31,507
LAURA: Don't touch Doty!

2649
02:53:31,507 --> 02:53:33,070
MATT: It's my favourite board game.

2650
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:36,346
ALL: Don't. Touch. Doty!

2651
02:53:36,346 --> 02:53:38,332
MATT: Waiting for it.

2652
02:53:38,332 --> 02:53:41,622
LIAM: Seems like a Catholic school game.

2653
02:53:41,622 --> 02:53:44,303
(laughter)

2654
02:53:44,303 --> 02:53:47,108
MATT: All right, so, what are you doing?

2655
02:53:47,108 --> 02:53:48,450
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2656
02:53:48,450 --> 02:53:52,006
LAURA: Oh no. We're going to scry on Hotis.

2657
02:53:52,006 --> 02:53:57,148
MARISHA: We're going to scry on Hotis. I'm going
to scry, using my 5th-level spell, not the Scrying

2658
02:53:57,148 --> 02:54:01,619
Eye because I want to use my spell ability, and
it's going to be awesome, and I'm not going to be

2659
02:54:01,619 --> 02:54:04,803
hiding from a soul that I accidentally consumed.

2660
02:54:04,803 --> 02:54:06,619
LIAM: No, you're going to be bottoming out.

2661
02:54:06,619 --> 02:54:08,919
MATT: Okay, hold on just a second.

2662
02:54:08,919 --> 02:54:10,507
LIAM: Just need another soul, man.

2663
02:54:10,507 --> 02:54:12,843
MARISHA: Let's add to Keyleth's guilt a little bit
more.

2664
02:54:12,843 --> 02:54:19,422
LAURA: It's okay, it was already dead, Keyleth. Or
maybe it was like the soul gems.

2665
02:54:19,422 --> 02:54:21,838
TRAVIS: Yep, that thing was still alive.

2666
02:54:21,838 --> 02:54:25,555
MARISHA: Don't say any of that. I've got to
focus.

2667
02:54:25,555 --> 02:54:27,300
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
kidding, kidding, I'm totally kidding.

2668
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:29,728
LIAM: Here-- I'm sure it was somebody who murdered
children, you know?

2669
02:54:29,728 --> 02:54:31,315
It was probably a major arsehole.

2670
02:54:31,315 --> 02:54:33,131
LAURA: Yeah, it was probably a really bad person,
and now they're inside of you.

2671
02:54:33,131 --> 02:54:34,915
MARISHA: You know, not something else I'd want
right now, no. None of these things.

2672
02:54:34,915 --> 02:54:36,072
MATT: What level spell is the scry?

2673
02:54:36,072 --> 02:54:37,057
MARISHA: Fifth.

2674
02:54:37,057 --> 02:54:43,479
MATT: Fifth? As soon as you cast the spell and
center your vision on the idea of Hotis, the spell

2675
02:54:43,479 --> 02:54:45,884
immediately fizzles and dissipates.

2676
02:54:45,884 --> 02:54:47,159
LIAM: Son of a--

2677
02:54:47,159 --> 02:54:49,185
MARISHA: Son of a-- god--

2678
02:54:49,185 --> 02:54:53,011
MATT: And you begin to remember, through your
research of the rakshasa, up to a certain level of

2679
02:54:53,011 --> 02:54:56,210
spells, 6th-level spells, they're immune to it.

2680
02:54:56,210 --> 02:55:01,370
MARISHA: Damn it to the Nine-- or Second Layer of
Hell. All right.

2681
02:55:01,370 --> 02:55:03,942
LAURA: So, cast it at a higher level.

2682
02:55:03,942 --> 02:55:05,860
MARISHA: So, I'm going to try again.

2683
02:55:05,860 --> 02:55:06,963
LAURA: At what level?

2684
02:55:06,963 --> 02:55:08,630
MARISHA: I'm going to-- we're in for the night,
yeah?

2685
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:10,200
LAURA: We can be.

2686
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:13,308
LIAM: That's the plan. That's the intention.

2687
02:55:13,308 --> 02:55:14,718
MARISHA: We're going to eat a Heroes' Feast.

2688
02:55:14,718 --> 02:55:18,241
LIAM: All topped off at the moment, so whatever
you do, we'll make up.

2689
02:55:18,241 --> 02:55:22,465
LAURA: Do we know if the Nine Hells have day and
night the same way--

2690
02:55:22,465 --> 02:55:24,512
TRAVIS: I'm not topped off; I need four hit
points.

2691
02:55:24,512 --> 02:55:29,839
LIAM: I touch Grog's shoulder and I give him four
hit points.

2692
02:55:29,839 --> 02:55:32,731
MATT: And, just like that--

2693
02:55:32,731 --> 02:55:34,728
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2694
02:55:34,728 --> 02:55:35,900
LIAM: Ticklish.

2695
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:37,113
MATT: Yeah, a little bit.

2696
02:55:37,113 --> 02:55:38,885
LAURA: Does this place have day and night the same
way?

2697
02:55:38,885 --> 02:55:42,462
MARISHA: We'll be eating a Heroes' Feast,
correct?

2698
02:55:42,462 --> 02:55:44,371
LAURA: Yeah, but are we going to scry first?

2699
02:55:44,371 --> 02:55:45,511
MARISHA: Yeah!

2700
02:55:45,511 --> 02:55:46,904
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

2701
02:55:46,904 --> 02:55:50,799
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! I'm going to do
an 8th-level Scry.

2702
02:55:50,799 --> 02:55:52,242
MATT: An 8th-level Scrying?

2703
02:55:52,242 --> 02:55:53,292
MARISHA: On Hotis.

2704
02:55:53,292 --> 02:55:54,471
LAURA: Shit!

2705
02:55:54,471 --> 02:55:55,353
MATT: Okay!

2706
02:55:55,353 --> 02:55:56,217
LIAM: Boom!

2707
02:55:56,217 --> 02:55:57,254
LAURA: Eat it, Hotis!

2708
02:55:57,254 --> 02:55:58,509
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Show me what you got!

2709
02:55:58,509 --> 02:55:59,700
LIAM: Ho-dis!

2710
02:55:59,700 --> 02:56:00,886
LAURA: Eat that scry!

2711
02:56:00,886 --> 02:56:01,802
TRAVIS: He's rolling.

2712
02:56:01,802 --> 02:56:03,204
LAURA: Oh god, he is.

2713
02:56:03,204 --> 02:56:07,147
MATT: This time, you grit your teeth. The space
is already prepared for

2714
02:56:07,147 --> 02:56:08,690
the first ritual you did.

2715
02:56:08,862 --> 02:56:13,849
MARISHA: I also give it a good ten minutes, let
him get distracted and forget that he, maybe, just

2716
02:56:13,849 --> 02:56:15,479
got scryed on.

2717
02:56:15,479 --> 02:56:23,313
MATT: Okay! You close your eyes, and this time,
remembering both the original conflicts with him

2718
02:56:23,313 --> 02:56:31,147
in the Quad Roads, the battle, which you recall
was at the base of a statue of Dispater, the

2719
02:56:31,147 --> 02:56:33,930
archdevil of this sphere of Hell.

2720
02:56:33,930 --> 02:56:36,555
MARISHA: Oh fuck, no.

2721
02:56:36,555 --> 02:56:45,546
MATT: Way back when. You remember him falling off
the top of the balcony with Vax--

2722
02:56:45,546 --> 02:56:47,393
LIAM: Good times.

2723
02:56:47,393 --> 02:56:49,114
LAURA: And then being stabbed by Scanlan.

2724
02:56:49,114 --> 02:56:55,052
MATT: -- and using these memories, you focus on
the essence of Hotis. Your vision suddenly pulls

2725
02:56:55,052 --> 02:57:04,249
out of the top of this chamber that you're in, to
a brief glance, just a flash over the horizon of

2726
02:57:04,249 --> 02:57:10,056
the city, and there you see the ominous dark
tower, for but a moment. Then there's a flash as

2727
02:57:10,056 --> 02:57:23,683
your vision is pulled further into this cityscape
of darkened, withering alleys, and the whole

2728
02:57:23,683 --> 02:57:29,925
atmosphere as the core of this space that you guys
are heading towards seems to be disheveled,

2729
02:57:29,925 --> 02:57:36,981
ruined, destitute, and filthy. Your vision is
dragged in that direction, to ground level, then

2730
02:57:36,981 --> 02:57:47,938
below, and is brought, suddenly thrust into
chambers, dark, bars, iron doors, a prison. A

2731
02:57:47,938 --> 02:57:52,593
prison beneath the streets of the city. There's
another flash. You see devils, dozens of them,

2732
02:57:52,593 --> 02:57:57,974
walking guards, some larger than others. You see a
flash of large, red leathery wings. You see

2733
02:57:57,974 --> 02:58:05,346
something horned and dark, grinning beyond a metal
door, and then beyond that door, there's another

2734
02:58:05,346 --> 02:58:12,754
flash, and on the inside, you see tendrils of red
flesh extending from the ceilings and the walls,

2735
02:58:12,754 --> 02:58:22,074
all merging to a center small core. There you see
this fleshy egg-like structure, about this large,

2736
02:58:22,074 --> 02:58:30,143
that is suspended by these strands of muscle-y
sinew, and there you see writhing and twisting

2737
02:58:30,143 --> 02:58:36,747
within the membrane of this, a small, misshapen
humanoid cat-like creature that is currently

2738
02:58:36,747 --> 02:58:41,652
writhing on the inside. You can hear the faint
squealing and screaming--

2739
02:58:41,652 --> 02:58:42,831
LAURA: (high-pitched) Rakshasa!

2740
02:58:42,831 --> 02:58:50,413
MATT: -- in pain as Hotis, not yet fully formed,
slowly torturing its way back to its full physical

2741
02:58:50,413 --> 02:58:58,176
form, is just screaming with hatred, awaiting
the moments of vengeance once the torturous pain

2742
02:58:58,348 --> 02:59:03,200
that currently consumes its existence fades and it
can once more plot its return to the Prime

2743
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:04,902
Material Plane.

2744
02:59:04,902 --> 02:59:09,206
MARISHA: But it was in a prison underground, under
the tower?

2745
02:59:09,206 --> 02:59:10,575
LIAM: In a Faberge egg.

2746
02:59:10,575 --> 02:59:12,954
MATT: Underneath this portion of the city, or a
little ways ahead.

2747
02:59:12,954 --> 02:59:14,139
TALIESIN: Suspended by octopi.

2748
02:59:14,139 --> 02:59:15,550
MARISHA: Holy fuck!

2749
02:59:15,550 --> 02:59:17,166
TALIESIN: This is going to go great!

2750
02:59:17,166 --> 02:59:18,101
MARISHA: Holy shit!

2751
02:59:18,101 --> 02:59:19,681
LAURA: Anything else? Anything else? Anything
else? Did you see anything else?

2752
02:59:19,681 --> 02:59:23,434
MATT: That's all you see. You just saw flashes
just leading into this. You have no idea exactly

2753
02:59:23,434 --> 02:59:30,154
where it is. All you saw were flashes of a prison
under the city, and Hotis

2754
02:59:30,154 --> 02:59:33,542
still incubating in this chamber.

2755
02:59:33,542 --> 02:59:35,909
TRAVIS: We've got to get arrested.

2756
02:59:35,909 --> 02:59:40,801
LAURA: Or become police officers.

2757
02:59:40,801 --> 02:59:43,255
LIAM: Yeah! Police Academy, that's the thing the
do!

2758
02:59:43,255 --> 02:59:45,125
TRAVIS: Keyleth will get arrested, no problem.

2759
02:59:45,125 --> 02:59:52,016
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true. Just tell me to go do
something in public. That's all you need. All

2760
02:59:52,016 --> 03:00:03,393
right. So, I'm remembering, it seems like Hotis
might serve the devil of this realm, the leader,

2761
03:00:03,393 --> 03:00:07,699
the president, as you have said a few times,
Grog.

2762
03:00:07,765 --> 03:00:08,977
TRAVIS: Dispator.

2763
03:00:08,977 --> 03:00:15,576
MARISHA: Mm-hm, Dispator. Seems like he serves
him, and is in a prison. You know what's fun, I

2764
03:00:15,576 --> 03:00:19,664
feel like a lot of the things we were looking for
this whole time are all underground. It's like an

2765
03:00:19,664 --> 03:00:22,192
underground city. Man, this is terrifying.

2766
03:00:22,192 --> 03:00:25,485
TALIESIN: What if that means it's just as hot
underground?

2767
03:00:25,485 --> 03:00:34,293
MARISHA: (exhales) Well, the good news is, once we
find Hotis, it'll be super easy. The bad news is,

2768
03:00:34,518 --> 03:00:36,976
finding Hotis? Super hard.

2769
03:00:36,976 --> 03:00:41,087
LIAM: Gotta find out-- I assume she's-- you've
filled us all in on what you saw.

2770
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:43,300
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm assuming I translated.

2771
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:49,860
TALIESIN: So all we have to do is teleport through
that tree that's underground. We can send him a

2772
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:52,034
small bonsai tree, as a gift.

2773
03:00:52,034 --> 03:00:54,149
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh my god, oh my god!

2774
03:00:54,149 --> 03:00:55,745
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, then as soon as he wakes
up--

2775
03:00:55,745 --> 03:00:57,458
LIAM: We have to find the prison--

2776
03:00:57,458 --> 03:01:00,711
TALIESIN: We have to find the prison, find out
what it is, who runs it--

2777
03:01:00,711 --> 03:01:04,411
LIAM: And then get in, get arrested, get--

2778
03:01:04,411 --> 03:01:06,954
TALIESIN: Infiltrate, perhaps. Call a favor.

2779
03:01:06,954 --> 03:01:17,223
MARISHA: I have a weird feeling that this prison
is run by Dis-- Lord Dispater himself.

2780
03:01:17,223 --> 03:01:18,324
LIAM: James Spader.

2781
03:01:18,324 --> 03:01:19,671
MARISHA: James Spader.

2782
03:01:19,671 --> 03:01:23,688
TRAVIS: Wait, you said it wasn't fully formed,
right? It's still, like, in its goo phase?

2783
03:01:23,688 --> 03:01:25,093
MARISHA: It is.

2784
03:01:25,093 --> 03:01:28,806
TRAVIS: Am I the only one that feels like this is
an awful lot of trouble for something that's not a

2785
03:01:28,806 --> 03:01:30,230
problem yet?

2786
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:35,053
TALIESIN: The trouble is, once it becomes a
problem, it continues to be a problem until you

2787
03:01:35,053 --> 03:01:37,007
cut it off at the root.

2788
03:01:37,007 --> 03:01:40,209
LAURA: He only stops when you kill him down here.

2789
03:01:40,209 --> 03:01:45,855
LIAM: Right, Grog, it's two different sets of
problems. Here, he's a wee, wee bab in a chocolate

2790
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:50,733
egg, but getting to him is difficult. If we wait,
then he gets the jump on us when we're sleeping in

2791
03:01:50,733 --> 03:01:52,067
our beds.

2792
03:01:52,067 --> 03:01:53,383
TRAVIS: Not in a chocolate egg?

2793
03:01:53,383 --> 03:01:59,056
LIAM: Not in a chocolate egg. Then he looks like a
guy in a mascot suit at a Winter's Crest fair.

2794
03:01:59,056 --> 03:02:00,652
LAURA: Or like Gilmore.

2795
03:02:00,652 --> 03:02:02,307
MARISHA: Or like Keyleth.

2796
03:02:02,307 --> 03:02:04,582
TALIESIN: Or like Pike.

2797
03:02:04,582 --> 03:02:08,506
LAURA: Oh, I can't even imagine Hotis disguised as
Pike.

2798
03:02:08,506 --> 03:02:11,439
MARISHA: I know, what a dick move that would be.

2799
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:16,207
LIAM: So, it's now or later, it's just a different
set of problems, and now we know what we're doing

2800
03:02:16,207 --> 03:02:17,553
at least.

2801
03:02:17,553 --> 03:02:19,037
TRAVIS: Okay.

2802
03:02:19,037 --> 03:02:21,050
MARISHA: So--

2803
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:27,482
TALIESIN: I may-- well, I'm tempted to head
downstairs to have a drink, start scoping out and

2804
03:02:27,482 --> 03:02:31,499
see who might know what's what about that prison.

2805
03:02:31,499 --> 03:02:35,336
LIAM: I mean, we know fucking nobody in this
city.

2806
03:02:35,336 --> 03:02:36,182
TALIESIN: No.

2807
03:02:36,182 --> 03:02:41,838
LIAM: And they all look like garbage, so why don't
we just start with the garbage downstairs?

2808
03:02:41,838 --> 03:02:46,472
TRAVIS: Small question: we checked in as-- you
checked in as tieflings.

2809
03:02:46,472 --> 03:02:51,964
LAURA: Yeah. We have to re-alter ourselves before
we go downstairs.

2810
03:02:51,964 --> 03:02:54,460
TRAVIS: For bursts of an hour, each time?

2811
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:58,848
TALIESIN: Or we could just not talk about it and
see if anyone actually notices, just see if

2812
03:02:58,848 --> 03:03:01,082
anyone's going to be rude about it.

2813
03:03:01,082 --> 03:03:03,201
TRAVIS: There's only a few rooms in this place,
right?

2814
03:03:03,201 --> 03:03:06,460
MARISHA: They keep a fairly close eye on their
patrons.

2815
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:11,962
TRAVIS: I would think so-- ol' broken sausage
finger may be sharper than we think.

2816
03:03:11,962 --> 03:03:16,105
MARISHA: Hmm, I have a feeling there are more eyes
on us here than we even realise.

2817
03:03:16,105 --> 03:03:17,551
LAURA: Oh, I'm sure.

2818
03:03:17,551 --> 03:03:19,702
TRAVIS: Hey, I'm really hungry, can we have that
fucking Feast now?

2819
03:03:19,702 --> 03:03:20,867
LAURA: Yeah.

2820
03:03:20,867 --> 03:03:23,489
MARISHA: Yeah, and I make a Heroes' Feast.

2821
03:03:23,489 --> 03:03:27,255
MATT: All righty. You guys go ahead and muster the
Heroes' Feast.

2822
03:03:27,255 --> 03:03:29,685
LAURA: I mark off 1,000 gold.

2823
03:03:29,685 --> 03:03:32,524
LIAM: Extra hit points, no fear.

2824
03:03:32,524 --> 03:03:33,584
MARISHA: Yep.

2825
03:03:33,584 --> 03:03:34,793
LIAM: Lustrous hair.

2826
03:03:34,793 --> 03:03:37,043
TALIESIN: Shiny fingernails.

2827
03:03:37,043 --> 03:03:40,662
LIAM: Shiny fingernails. Feel like you ate a
soul.

2828
03:03:40,662 --> 03:03:46,067
LAURA: Does that mean all of our heal-- our points
are healed, or are we just--

2829
03:03:46,067 --> 03:03:47,756
MATT: Well, if you guys take a full rest, you
will.

2830
03:03:47,756 --> 03:03:52,522
LAURA: Oh. Oh, that's the question I wanted to ask
you: did we know if here,

2831
03:03:52,522 --> 03:03:54,653
night and day is the same?

2832
03:03:54,653 --> 03:03:56,496
MATT: You don't know that.

2833
03:03:56,496 --> 03:03:58,781
LAURA: No, that wasn't in any of his books?

2834
03:03:58,781 --> 03:04:01,516
MATT: Make an intelligence check, actually.

2835
03:04:04,023 --> 03:04:06,317
TALIESIN: That's 12.

2836
03:04:06,317 --> 03:04:13,315
MATT: You really have no idea. I mean, there are
beds, there are places to stay, and from what you

2837
03:04:13,315 --> 03:04:19,812
can tell, there are-- there is traffic from
creatures that travel from different planes,

2838
03:04:19,812 --> 03:04:25,025
probably require sleep. So, whether or not there
is a day-night cycle based on any sort of

2839
03:04:25,025 --> 03:04:33,024
improbable sun, there probably are expected
day-sleep cycles for creatures

2840
03:04:33,024 --> 03:04:34,296
that need to sleep.

2841
03:04:34,296 --> 03:04:36,220
TRAVIS: They pump oxygen in, you can stay up as
late as you want.

2842
03:04:36,220 --> 03:04:37,424
MATT: Yeah, it's fine.

2843
03:04:37,424 --> 03:04:38,615
MARISHA: No windows.

2844
03:04:38,615 --> 03:04:39,955
MATT: So Keyleth, roll 2d10.

2845
03:04:39,955 --> 03:04:41,452
MARISHA: All right.

2846
03:04:41,452 --> 03:04:42,539
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

2847
03:04:42,539 --> 03:04:44,507
TRAVIS: Come on, now.

2848
03:04:44,507 --> 03:04:51,194
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies! That's an eight
for one, and the other, not as good. Ten total.

2849
03:04:51,194 --> 03:04:57,165
MATT: Okay, so everyone gets a bonus of ten--
that's an average, I guess. Close to average. So,

2850
03:04:57,165 --> 03:05:00,716
ten maximum hit point increase to everybody for
the next 24 hours.

2851
03:05:00,716 --> 03:05:11,425
MARISHA: I also, at the end of dinner say, I would
like to raise a toast. To Vox Machina: for going

2852
03:05:11,425 --> 03:05:16,047
and being together all the way into hell and
back.

2853
03:05:16,047 --> 03:05:18,133
LAURA: Well, fingers crossed.

2854
03:05:18,133 --> 03:05:19,798
LIAM: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

2855
03:05:19,798 --> 03:05:21,028
TRAVIS: We might not come back.

2856
03:05:21,028 --> 03:05:22,965
MARISHA: Well, all the way to Hell and--

2857
03:05:22,965 --> 03:05:24,047
TALIESIN: To hell!

2858
03:05:24,047 --> 03:05:24,948
TRAVIS: Here.

2859
03:05:24,948 --> 03:05:27,661
MATT: "Thanks to the wonderful guidance of the
Voice of the Tempest!"

2860
03:05:27,661 --> 03:05:28,575
LAURA: Okay.

2861
03:05:28,575 --> 03:05:29,478
TRAVIS: (sighs) Oh Tary.

2862
03:05:29,478 --> 03:05:31,013
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

2863
03:05:31,013 --> 03:05:34,710
MATT: "Keyleth of the Air Ashari and-- keep
writing this down-- and to the majesty and the

2864
03:05:34,710 --> 03:05:38,163
heroic and adventurous drive--"

2865
03:05:38,163 --> 03:05:39,357
MARISHA: Yes!

2866
03:05:39,357 --> 03:05:40,819
MATT: "Of Taryon Darrington!"

2867
03:05:40,819 --> 03:05:45,114
MARISHA: Of Tary-- Everybody, to Taryon
Darrington!

2868
03:05:45,114 --> 03:05:48,045
MATT: "To me!"

2869
03:05:48,045 --> 03:05:59,857
MARISHA: And with that, I do Inspiring Leader, my
newest feat since I'm a leader.

2870
03:05:59,857 --> 03:06:02,581
(laughter)

2871
03:06:02,581 --> 03:06:04,486
TALIESIN: What voice is this?

2872
03:06:04,486 --> 03:06:06,193
MARISHA: Mine.

2873
03:06:06,193 --> 03:06:08,825
TALIESIN: This is your "Leader" voice.

2874
03:06:08,825 --> 03:06:12,410
MARISHA: This is why I'm a voice actor. And--

2875
03:06:12,410 --> 03:06:14,836
MATT: So you cheer and talk for about ten
minutes.

2876
03:06:14,836 --> 03:06:24,357
MARISHA: Yes, cheers to Taryon Darrington and his
glistening armor and his flowing locks of golden

2877
03:06:24,357 --> 03:06:27,832
hair. And I continue for ten minutes about Taryon
Darrington.

2878
03:06:27,832 --> 03:06:29,156
LAURA: Wow.

2879
03:06:29,156 --> 03:06:35,508
MARISHA: And his glistening boots of shining
upkeep. And his--

2880
03:06:35,508 --> 03:06:37,594
TRAVIS: He's losing hit points from this.

2881
03:06:37,594 --> 03:06:39,226
LAURA: I want to throw up.

2882
03:06:39,226 --> 03:06:41,006
MATT: And the whole time Doty's--

2883
03:06:41,006 --> 03:06:45,876
MARISHA: Writing it all down. And then I give
temporary hit points equal to my level, which is

2884
03:06:45,876 --> 03:06:51,827
17, plus my charisma modifier, which is nothing.
So you get an extra 17 on that ten.

2885
03:06:51,827 --> 03:06:53,371
MATT: That's temporary, though.

2886
03:06:53,371 --> 03:06:54,869
MARISHA: Temporary.

2887
03:06:54,869 --> 03:06:58,502
LAURA: Why are we inspired by hearing you talk all
that shit about Tary?

2888
03:06:58,502 --> 03:06:59,795
LIAM: Because it's in the spellbook.

2889
03:06:59,795 --> 03:07:01,311
LAURA: I don't feel inspired.

2890
03:07:01,311 --> 03:07:09,599
MARISHA: Well, because I would hope that with my,
you know, Tary's golden locks of flowing hair and

2891
03:07:09,599 --> 03:07:15,471
with my very impressive cape that I got, you know,
for touring the world.

2892
03:07:15,471 --> 03:07:17,100
Like a frequent flyer card.

2893
03:07:17,100 --> 03:07:22,262
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, Taryon
got 17 temporary hit points.

2894
03:07:22,262 --> 03:07:23,576
(laughter)

2895
03:07:23,576 --> 03:07:29,865
MARISHA: What?! No! You know what, Vex, I'm still,
I'm still practicing.

2896
03:07:29,938 --> 03:07:33,474
LAURA: You know what? It's getting there. Next
time, share the compliments,

2897
03:07:33,474 --> 03:07:35,989
make all of us feel cool.

2898
03:07:36,153 --> 03:07:39,079
LIAM: And all this while, Vax has been staring at
Taryon and imagining him

2899
03:07:39,079 --> 03:07:41,584
with exactly half a beard.

2900
03:07:41,584 --> 03:07:45,168
(laughter)

2901
03:07:45,168 --> 03:07:49,523
MATT: While Taryon notices you staring intently
and she's giving this inspiring speech about how

2902
03:07:49,523 --> 03:07:53,948
amazing he is-- Taryon looks over at you and goes,
"She's hitting on me."

2903
03:07:53,948 --> 03:07:55,100
(laughter)

2904
03:07:55,100 --> 03:08:00,585
MARISHA: With his belt that is bejeweled and his
very bedazzled pauldrons and his--

2905
03:08:00,585 --> 03:08:03,400
LAURA: So over this part.

2906
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:08,118
MARISHA: Very, very manicured cuticles. And I
don't know what else to say for

2907
03:08:08,118 --> 03:08:09,784
ten minutes about Tary.

2908
03:08:09,784 --> 03:08:12,236
TRAVIS: Are we staying in? For the, for a bit?

2909
03:08:12,236 --> 03:08:14,029
TALIESIN: On the plus side, we're all very tired
now.

2910
03:08:14,029 --> 03:08:17,061
LIAM: What else is there to say about Taryon
Darrington?

2911
03:08:17,061 --> 03:08:19,817
MARISHA: Don't ask me. Please don't ask me.

2912
03:08:19,817 --> 03:08:21,986
MATT: What are you guys doing? Are you resting?

2913
03:08:21,986 --> 03:08:25,632
LAURA: I don't know. Should we? Rest? I don't even
know what time it is here.

2914
03:08:25,632 --> 03:08:27,227
MATT: You don't.

2915
03:08:27,227 --> 03:08:31,001
LAURA: It could be like early morning and we could
rest and then wake up in the middle of the night.

2916
03:08:31,001 --> 03:08:35,029
TRAVIS: We've only been traveling for like a few
hours, right?

2917
03:08:35,029 --> 03:08:37,058
LAURA: But it could be a completely different time
here!

2918
03:08:37,058 --> 03:08:39,882
MATT: Yeah. But it's more about your internal
clock, whatever you want to do.

2919
03:08:39,882 --> 03:08:42,701
TALIESIN: It took us quite a while to find this
place.

2920
03:08:42,701 --> 03:08:46,036
MARISHA: I've also expended my 6th, 7th and
8th-level spells.

2921
03:08:46,036 --> 03:08:49,910
MATT: It took an hour, a little over an hour since
your arrival. Since you guys did your

2922
03:08:49,978 --> 03:08:51,587
transformations.

2923
03:08:51,587 --> 03:08:56,465
LIAM: Yeah. We went to bed, got up, and then--
what was that?

2924
03:08:56,465 --> 03:08:59,863
LAURA: Oh, that was a burp. I forgot we were
filming. (laughs)

2925
03:08:59,863 --> 03:09:02,153
MATT: Yeah. You've had maybe three hours, four
hours since waking up in the morning.

2926
03:09:02,153 --> 03:09:04,639
LIAM: It's like noon in our internal clock,
probably.

2927
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:06,831
LAURA: I feel like we should just fucking try to
do something.

2928
03:09:06,831 --> 03:09:14,871
TRAVIS: Yeah, so if we've got to find our way to
some sort of prison, two options. Get arrested. Or

2929
03:09:14,871 --> 03:09:20,147
ask people where people go who get arrested, which
seems really fishy and stupid.

2930
03:09:20,147 --> 03:09:27,492
MARISHA: It seemed like it was underground, almost
spanning this entire city. We could possibly try

2931
03:09:27,492 --> 03:09:30,633
and find a back entrance. I don't know.

2932
03:09:30,633 --> 03:09:35,237
LIAM: We need to talk to somebody. Just talk to
somebody. We can walk around for another two hours

2933
03:09:35,237 --> 03:09:40,074
and wait until somebody gets the heebie-jeebies
from us and fucks us up. Or we can talk to

2934
03:09:40,074 --> 03:09:43,141
somebody. I'm going to talk to somebody.

2935
03:09:43,141 --> 03:09:44,802
(laughter)

2936
03:09:44,802 --> 03:09:46,560
LAURA: Well, there's the owner downstairs, the
creepy guy.

2937
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:47,543
LIAM: I've already left the room.

2938
03:09:47,543 --> 03:09:48,720
LAURA: Oh, Jesus.

2939
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:49,876
TALIESIN: I follow him.

2940
03:09:49,876 --> 03:09:51,887
LAURA: I follow. Wait! We're not altered!

2941
03:09:51,887 --> 03:09:53,532
MARISHA: No, you're not.

2942
03:09:53,532 --> 03:09:54,980
TALIESIN: No. He already went down.

2943
03:09:54,980 --> 03:09:56,812
MARISHA: You want to come back-- Vax, Vax, Vax,
Vax!

2944
03:09:56,812 --> 03:09:57,762
LIAM: Yeah?

2945
03:09:57,762 --> 03:09:59,477
MARISHA: You're not altered! You're not altered!
Hey! Hey!

2946
03:09:59,477 --> 03:10:00,640
LIAM: I do a quick U-turn.

2947
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:02,882
TALIESIN: All right, we grab him, drag him back
in.

2948
03:10:02,882 --> 03:10:04,000
LAURA: Oh god.

2949
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:09,559
MATT: At which, as Tary goes, "All right, Doty.
Let him through," as you leave, Doty kind of moves

2950
03:10:09,559 --> 03:10:15,061
away from the door and lets you by. As he bends
forward with kind of the taut gesture of bowing as

2951
03:10:15,061 --> 03:10:17,920
you pass by, you see his entire back is glowing
bright red.

2952
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:19,442
(laughter)

2953
03:10:19,442 --> 03:10:23,588
LAURA: Tary, can he heat up to the point that he
doesn't work any more?

2954
03:10:23,588 --> 03:10:29,928
MATT: "I hope not. Probably not. I'm going to say
not."

2955
03:10:29,928 --> 03:10:32,767
LAURA: You made him, after all. You would know.

2956
03:10:32,767 --> 03:10:37,279
MATT: "Right. It's fine." He looks over to
Percival. "Right? He's going to be fine?"

2957
03:10:37,279 --> 03:10:43,507
TALIESIN: Maybe flip? Flip sides, just keep
flipping the sides.

2958
03:10:43,507 --> 03:10:47,506
MATT: "Right! All right, Doty: chest against the
wall." And Doty just kind of pancakes against the

2959
03:10:47,506 --> 03:10:49,201
door a second time.

2960
03:10:49,201 --> 03:10:50,513
TRAVIS: I wish I had some bacon right now.

2961
03:10:50,513 --> 03:10:51,526
LAURA: Tary?

2962
03:10:51,526 --> 03:10:52,453
MATT: "Mm-hm?"

2963
03:10:52,453 --> 03:10:54,571
LAURA: Can you Alter Self again, on us?

2964
03:10:54,571 --> 03:11:02,692
MATT: Let's see, I'm going to check the character
sheet that I got sent.

2965
03:11:02,692 --> 03:11:04,573
LIAM: You're god, you can do anything.

2966
03:11:04,573 --> 03:11:07,440
LAURA: If we're screwed, we might have to be us.

2967
03:11:07,504 --> 03:11:09,069
TALIESIN: We might have to.

2968
03:11:09,069 --> 03:11:17,176
MATT: Well, he can cast Alter Self, he goes, "I
can technically do it one more time."

2969
03:11:17,176 --> 03:11:20,338
LAURA: But you'll be out of other things you can
do?

2970
03:11:20,338 --> 03:11:25,923
MATT: "I will be out of all my things. Of the big
things. I mean, I still can--" He kind of jostles

2971
03:11:25,923 --> 03:11:31,618
a satchel he has on the side, you hear a bunch of
glass and things clinking. He says, "I still have

2972
03:11:31,618 --> 03:11:41,847
"my accoutrements. But as far my devices to help
you guys out, I'm kind of spent at that point. But--"

2973
03:11:41,847 --> 03:11:48,440
TRAVIS: You know, I still look the way I did when
I checked in. Looking like me going to go and do

2974
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:50,637
all the recon.

2975
03:11:50,637 --> 03:11:54,345
MARISHA: I can do Alter Self at will, I'm just not
the best person to talk to people.

2976
03:11:54,345 --> 03:11:56,867
MATT: "Why don't we let the two of them go?"

2977
03:11:56,867 --> 03:11:59,478
TALIESIN: (inhales nervously)

2978
03:11:59,478 --> 03:12:00,767
LAURA: Oh god.

2979
03:12:00,767 --> 03:12:06,714
MARISHA: Are you? Is that Grog and Keyleth?

2980
03:12:06,714 --> 03:12:07,671
LAURA: Yes.

2981
03:12:07,671 --> 03:12:12,793
MARISHA: Grog and Keyleth. Haven't done it for a
while. Grog and Minxie. (laughs nervously)

2982
03:12:12,793 --> 03:12:15,002
TRAVIS: What? You and I, me and the tiger?

2983
03:12:15,002 --> 03:12:20,111
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not saying I'd be a tiger. I'm
just hearkening back to our team-up.

2984
03:12:20,111 --> 03:12:21,969
TRAVIS: But you said Minxie.

2985
03:12:21,969 --> 03:12:24,001
LIAM: Yeah but, I mean, I haven't stepped in lava
in a while. Doesn't mean that's something I should

2986
03:12:24,001 --> 03:12:25,404
right now.

2987
03:12:25,404 --> 03:12:28,627
MARISHA: Well, you know, it's what we call a
call-back? You know, don't worry about it.

2988
03:12:28,627 --> 03:12:32,342
TALIESIN: It's, you know, what's-- No, I don't
want to say what's the worst that could happen.

2989
03:12:32,342 --> 03:12:36,992
What's the best could happen? What's the best
outcome here?

2990
03:12:36,992 --> 03:12:44,354
LIAM: I feel like with Scanlan gone, our best
talker is this one.

2991
03:12:44,354 --> 03:12:46,904
TALIESIN: Yes. Probably the two of us, possibly.

2992
03:12:46,904 --> 03:12:51,473
TRAVIS: Where are you pointing, over here? I can't
see.

2993
03:12:51,473 --> 03:12:52,905
TALIESIN: Yes. Grog.

2994
03:12:52,905 --> 03:12:54,935
TRAVIS: I've got a head of hair in the way.
Where'd you point?

2995
03:12:54,935 --> 03:12:59,783
MARISHA: You know, Grog and I can be very
intimidating. Right, Grog?

2996
03:12:59,783 --> 03:13:03,736
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's more angry.

2997
03:13:03,736 --> 03:13:06,502
LAURA: You know, he might do great here. I haven't
been doing so hot.

2998
03:13:06,502 --> 03:13:11,492
LIAM: Yeah, but you know, I feel like in so many
situations we go: "What happens if I push this

2999
03:13:11,716 --> 03:13:13,656
"button? Let's just see what happens."

3000
03:13:13,656 --> 03:13:14,795
LAURA: Let's just send Grog down.

3001
03:13:14,795 --> 03:13:17,743
LIAM: But that's not what I'm saying. I'm actually
arguing the opposite of that. I'm saying for once,

3002
03:13:17,743 --> 03:13:23,422
maybe, I mean, you're a very good talker. Why
don't we send the person who's good at talking

3003
03:13:23,422 --> 03:13:30,715
down? Instead of on a lark, sending down, you
know, the brute to talk.

3004
03:13:30,715 --> 03:13:37,169
LAURA: Yeah, but everything I've tried hasn't
worked so far. Maybe they're immune to persuasion

3005
03:13:37,169 --> 03:13:41,602
down here and maybe all they need is a little
(grunts) a little jostle.

3006
03:13:41,602 --> 03:13:45,618
LIAM: Maybe you haven't been lucky. Maybe you need
to give it another shot. I mean, your average is a

3007
03:13:45,618 --> 03:13:47,769
little bit better than the Big Man's.

3008
03:13:47,769 --> 03:13:51,187
MARISHA: Yeah. We could go back to old-school days
and I could always go Minxie.

3009
03:13:51,187 --> 03:13:52,848
Little intimidation check?

3010
03:13:52,848 --> 03:13:56,966
TRAVIS: They're going to want to steal you and put
you in a cage.

3011
03:13:56,966 --> 03:14:01,755
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly content to just go down
there, and if anyone asks we've just changed into

3012
03:14:01,755 --> 03:14:02,993
something more comfortable.

3013
03:14:02,993 --> 03:14:04,281
LAURA: Let's just fucking go.

3014
03:14:04,281 --> 03:14:05,170
TALIESIN: Let's go.

3015
03:14:05,170 --> 03:14:07,112
LIAM: Both of you! You're both-- he can only do
one person.

3016
03:14:07,112 --> 03:14:10,730
MARISHA: Yeah. Are going to change into something?
Or are you just going to be totally oblivious that

3017
03:14:10,730 --> 03:14:13,377
you're definitely not the people who walked in
upstairs?

3018
03:14:13,377 --> 03:14:14,930
TALIESIN: I'm going to be totally okay.

3019
03:14:14,930 --> 03:14:16,137
MATT: "I have one capsule."

3020
03:14:16,137 --> 03:14:17,895
LAURA: We're going to be okay. He says he's got
enough for everyone still.

3021
03:14:17,895 --> 03:14:19,058
LIAM: He's only got enough for one.

3022
03:14:19,058 --> 03:14:21,252
LAURA: No, he can do it again to all of us.

3023
03:14:21,252 --> 03:14:23,176
MATT: "I can do it to one person"

3024
03:14:23,233 --> 03:14:24,400
LIAM: One person.

3025
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:26,263
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I go down as just backup.

3026
03:14:26,263 --> 03:14:28,904
LAURA: It's up to you, Percy, dear.

3027
03:14:28,904 --> 03:14:30,078
MARISHA: And I can do it at will.

3028
03:14:30,078 --> 03:14:31,094
LIAM: You go, you go.

3029
03:14:31,094 --> 03:14:33,711
TALIESIN: I don't think I-- do you think with the
capsule or without. I don't want to--

3030
03:14:33,711 --> 03:14:35,351
LAURA: With.

3031
03:14:35,508 --> 03:14:36,539
TALIESIN: Fine, with.

3032
03:14:36,539 --> 03:14:38,856
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. Someone pick who goes down and
talks. I feel like Grog.

3033
03:14:38,856 --> 03:14:41,597
LIAM: I just did. Percival, you're going. It's
hell, this is your game now.

3034
03:14:41,597 --> 03:14:43,628
LAURA: With Grog. You're going with Grog.

3035
03:14:43,628 --> 03:14:45,180
LIAM: Sure, as back-up, yes.

3036
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:46,112
MATT: "Be my guest."

3037
03:14:46,112 --> 03:14:47,965
MARISHA: Percy and Grog! Go, go, go, go!

3038
03:14:47,965 --> 03:14:53,358
MATT: All right, so as you take the coin and you
kind of focus on it (fwoosh) and your form shifts

3039
03:14:53,414 --> 03:14:58,765
back into the previous tiefling appearance.

3040
03:14:58,765 --> 03:15:02,495
TALIESIN: I grab a soul shard, I suck it down.
(sniffs)

3041
03:15:02,495 --> 03:15:03,896
LAURA: Have fun storming the castle.

3042
03:15:03,896 --> 03:15:05,011
TALIESIN: Oh, let's do this.

3043
03:15:05,011 --> 03:15:06,814
TRAVIS: Oh, you did a rail of soul, huh? Okay.
Sweet!

3044
03:15:06,814 --> 03:15:09,039
LIAM: He just-- (mimics snorting cocaine)

3045
03:15:09,039 --> 03:15:12,025
TALIESIN: And we head down.

3046
03:15:12,025 --> 03:15:14,256
LAURA: Did he really? Did you take soul?

3047
03:15:14,256 --> 03:15:18,009
TRAVIS: He did! He's so causal, he was like,
(inhales, then roars)

3048
03:15:18,009 --> 03:15:19,181
(laughter)

3049
03:15:19,181 --> 03:15:21,254
TALIESIN: (inhales) Let's do this. Sucked it down
like an oyster.

3050
03:15:21,254 --> 03:15:28,275
MATT: And as the rush hits you, you take a step
and pause for a moment, because the rush is strong

3051
03:15:28,275 --> 03:15:37,333
and familiar. It's similar to the sensation and
the rush you had when you took a life with the

3052
03:15:37,333 --> 03:15:39,765
Pepperbox when Orthax was still holding sway.

3053
03:15:39,765 --> 03:15:40,737
TALIESIN: Huh.

3054
03:15:40,737 --> 03:15:41,766
TRAVIS: Oh no.

3055
03:15:41,766 --> 03:15:47,141
MATT: That same passage of some sort of a soul
energy, and as the rush hits, that familiarity

3056
03:15:47,141 --> 03:15:54,709
itches you on the inside, and you're a little
caught off-guard and made uncomfortable by it.

3057
03:15:54,709 --> 03:15:58,255
LIAM: Steady as she goes, Percival.

3058
03:15:58,255 --> 03:16:01,238
MARISHA: Too much?

3059
03:16:01,238 --> 03:16:02,448
TALIESIN: Too much.

3060
03:16:02,448 --> 03:16:03,330
MARISHA: Little much?

3061
03:16:03,330 --> 03:16:04,183
TALIESIN: Little much.

3062
03:16:04,183 --> 03:16:05,083
MARISHA: Little overwhelming?

3063
03:16:05,083 --> 03:16:05,827
TALIESIN: Yes, little bit.

3064
03:16:05,827 --> 03:16:07,001
MARISHA: Okay.

3065
03:16:07,001 --> 03:16:11,449
TALIESIN: I'm going to be meditating upon that a
little bit later. Let's head downstairs.

3066
03:16:11,449 --> 03:16:14,126
LAURA: Come back, please.

3067
03:16:14,126 --> 03:16:18,727
LIAM: I place my hands on Grog's shoulder and
Percival's shoulder and cast Bless as they walk

3068
03:16:18,727 --> 03:16:20,022
out the door.

3069
03:16:20,022 --> 03:16:24,044
MATT: Okay. You guys head out, into the hallway.

3070
03:16:24,044 --> 03:16:25,446
LAURA: I smack both their asses.

3071
03:16:25,446 --> 03:16:26,673
MATT: (smack noise)

3072
03:16:26,673 --> 03:16:28,511
LIAM: You dive in front of me to do that?

3073
03:16:28,511 --> 03:16:29,903
LAURA: Yeah.

3074
03:16:29,903 --> 03:16:42,585
MATT: (laughs) And Taryon goes, (inhales deeply).
(laughs) He gets weirdly uncomfortable. All right,

3075
03:16:42,585 --> 03:16:51,690
so, you guys head back downstairs. The two devils
that were there feasting earlier appear to have

3076
03:16:51,690 --> 03:16:57,843
left, and the room is mostly quiet and empty now,
except for the same rough-looking bartender in the

3077
03:16:57,843 --> 03:17:04,083
corner and there, at the same table, is the
red-skinned, devilish, handsome gentleman. As you

3078
03:17:04,083 --> 03:17:07,892
walk down, you see what appears to be a small
impish creature that's on his shoulder, and he's

3079
03:17:07,892 --> 03:17:14,151
currently conversing with it quietly, and then as
you guys step down, he (waving noise) to it, and

3080
03:17:14,151 --> 03:17:20,879
it flies up, and skitters off into the distance
outside of the door. Turns to you, reaches over

3081
03:17:20,879 --> 03:17:23,144
and takes a bottle off the table and fills the
goblet.

3082
03:17:23,205 --> 03:17:25,620
TRAVIS: What comes out of the bottle?

3083
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:28,284
MATT: It appears to be some deep red liquid.

3084
03:17:28,284 --> 03:17:29,754
LAURA: Ugh.

3085
03:17:29,754 --> 03:17:31,394
LIAM: It's merlot.

3086
03:17:31,394 --> 03:17:33,448
LAURA: Oh. Yum.

3087
03:17:33,448 --> 03:17:37,401
MATT: He's watching you, but he's not expecting
any interface.

3088
03:17:37,401 --> 03:17:43,997
TALIESIN: I walk over. (clears throat) Could I
possibly entertain you with some company?

3089
03:17:43,997 --> 03:17:54,005
MATT: "It would-- it would be a change of pace
that is quite welcome. Take a seat, both of you."

3090
03:17:54,005 --> 03:17:59,136
TRAVIS: Okay.

3091
03:17:59,136 --> 03:18:07,924
MATT: The seats, as they-- they're heavy and
they're not quite as-- they're heated at the base,

3092
03:18:07,924 --> 03:18:14,374
they're warm to the touch, but they're not burning
you. You both pull them up and they grind against

3093
03:18:14,374 --> 03:18:23,670
the slate stone floor of the interior as you plop
down and sit. "Shall I also fetch you a drink?"

3094
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:30,247
TALIESIN: That sounds lovely. What is actually
available at this hour at this establishment?

3095
03:18:30,247 --> 03:18:35,442
MATT: "Available at the establishment, not this
kind of drink. My personal reserve,

3096
03:18:35,442 --> 03:18:38,186
"that I can offer."

3097
03:18:38,186 --> 03:18:44,812
TALIESIN: I would be curious, I would hate to be
indebted to you at this point, but I would be very

3098
03:18:44,812 --> 03:18:48,835
curious to try whatever it is that you consider to
be your personal stash.

3099
03:18:48,835 --> 03:18:51,186
MATT: "I would prefer you indebted to me."

3100
03:18:51,186 --> 03:18:53,308
MARISHA: Jesus.

3101
03:18:53,308 --> 03:19:01,797
MATT: And he lifts a finger and the gentleman at
the far edge of the bar stirs, "(grunts) Oh, right."

3102
03:19:01,797 --> 03:19:06,386
and Chris Farleys his pants a bit.

3103
03:19:06,386 --> 03:19:08,592
(laughter)

3104
03:19:08,592 --> 03:19:15,747
MATT: Comes over with two similar goblets and
places them on the table, and steps back to the

3105
03:19:15,747 --> 03:19:22,519
corner. The gentleman takes the bottle and fills
them both, kind of finishing the last bit he had

3106
03:19:22,519 --> 03:19:26,955
in Grog's chalice, and sets it to the side.

3107
03:19:26,955 --> 03:19:30,684
TALIESIN: What may I call you?

3108
03:19:30,684 --> 03:19:37,281
MATT: "You may call me Ipkesh. What may I call
you?"

3109
03:19:37,339 --> 03:19:40,981
TALIESIN: Ah, Freddie will do for now.

3110
03:19:40,981 --> 03:19:42,417
MATT: "Freddie?"

3111
03:19:42,417 --> 03:19:44,048
TRAVIS: Greg.

3112
03:19:44,048 --> 03:19:46,537
MATT: "Freddie and Greg?"

3113
03:19:49,848 --> 03:19:53,367
(laughs) God damn it!

3114
03:19:53,367 --> 03:19:54,780
TALIESIN: Broke the DM, ten points. Boom!

3115
03:19:54,780 --> 03:19:56,406
(laughter)

3116
03:19:56,406 --> 03:20:02,032
TALIESIN: Fuck souls, that's a rush.

3117
03:20:02,032 --> 03:20:04,463
LIAM: Two points for Gryffindor.

3118
03:20:04,463 --> 03:20:10,916
MARISHA: Oh man, buddy cop, go!

3119
03:20:10,916 --> 03:20:17,036
MATT: "So what brings you to my fine
establishment?"

3120
03:20:17,036 --> 03:20:19,414
TRAVIS: What does the chalice smell like?

3121
03:20:19,414 --> 03:20:24,272
MATT: Smells like a strong, alcoholic wine of some
kind.

3122
03:20:24,272 --> 03:20:26,440
TRAVIS: I take a big old sip.

3123
03:20:26,440 --> 03:20:31,794
MATT: It's good. It's very good. You're not a big
fan of wine, generally, because you're more of a

3124
03:20:31,794 --> 03:20:36,491
liquor and ale person, but as far as the wines
you've had, it's pretty good.

3125
03:20:36,491 --> 03:20:38,179
LIAM: Your pancreas melts.

3126
03:20:38,179 --> 03:20:41,744
TRAVIS: This, I'm sure you know, is really good.

3127
03:20:41,744 --> 03:20:50,427
MATT: "It better be. So, what is your business?"

3128
03:20:50,427 --> 03:20:57,472
TALIESIN: Honestly, cards on the table, we're in
town because a friend of ours got in badly with a

3129
03:20:57,472 --> 03:20:59,436
rakshasa.

3130
03:20:59,436 --> 03:21:03,605
MATT: "(chuckles) This is not an unfamiliar
tale."

3131
03:21:03,605 --> 03:21:12,277
TALIESIN: We figured not, and we're definitely out
of place, a bit out of sorts, and definitely out

3132
03:21:12,277 --> 03:21:19,161
of our depths, but thank you for the rooms. I
assume this is your establishment, is it not?

3133
03:21:19,161 --> 03:21:32,928
MATT: "I run it at the-- how do I say? A
partnership with my betters."

3134
03:21:32,928 --> 03:21:45,138
TALIESIN: I think I understand. Take another sip.
Ah, well, regardless of betters or otherwise, I'm

3135
03:21:45,138 --> 03:21:56,831
grateful for the sanctuary. All of us are. So we,
I assume, are not the first people you've met

3136
03:21:56,831 --> 03:22:02,002
coming into town, looking for a rakshasa?

3137
03:22:02,002 --> 03:22:12,338
MATT: "I have not met them, but stories do swirl,
and find my ears. It does all of us well here to

3138
03:22:12,338 --> 03:22:15,082
"know what's going on."

3139
03:22:15,082 --> 03:22:19,442
TALIESIN: Well, I will admit, we have some
questions.

3140
03:22:19,442 --> 03:22:22,686
MATT: "Well, perhaps I have some answers."

3141
03:22:22,686 --> 03:22:35,684
TALIESIN: We've heard of a-- would you call it a
prison? An underground series of cells, beneath

3142
03:22:35,684 --> 03:22:43,495
the tower? Beneath the tower, beneath the city.
That's where we think we might find our boy.

3143
03:22:43,495 --> 03:22:51,122
MATT: "There is a prison here, yes. I know it
well."

3144
03:22:51,122 --> 03:22:55,313
TALIESIN: You know it well, I would hope not from
personal experience?

3145
03:22:55,313 --> 03:23:12,291
MATT: "Oh, no, no. It imprisons many things, but--
I would be blunt with you as well. We live here

3146
03:23:12,291 --> 03:23:15,883
"under the interest of business, yes?"

3147
03:23:15,883 --> 03:23:17,338
TALIESIN: I understand.

3148
03:23:17,338 --> 03:23:19,310
MATT: "Information is a resource."

3149
03:23:19,310 --> 03:23:28,987
TALIESIN: A very, very great one. There is a
prison, underground, people go there. Perhaps this

3150
03:23:28,987 --> 03:23:36,102
is an easy question to ask that will flow freewy--
freely. What is this?

3151
03:23:36,216 --> 03:23:40,103
Why do people get sent to that prison?

3152
03:23:40,103 --> 03:23:45,084
MATT: "What do you have to offer for my
information?"

3153
03:23:45,084 --> 03:23:57,937
TALIESIN: What are you in the market for? I have
dull things, but I get the distinct impression

3154
03:23:57,937 --> 03:24:02,544
you're not necessarily somebody who's going to be
interested in coin?

3155
03:24:02,544 --> 03:24:11,997
MATT: "I prefer not to dole out small tidbits. I
prefer to bundle in larger packages."

3156
03:24:11,997 --> 03:24:16,750
TALIESIN: I understand. How do I know that what
you have to offer is worthwhile?

3157
03:24:16,917 --> 03:24:19,386
MATT: "I can--"

3158
03:24:19,386 --> 03:24:23,175
TALIESIN: I have a proposal.

3159
03:24:23,175 --> 03:24:25,665
MATT: "Hm, tempt me."

3160
03:24:25,665 --> 03:24:32,105
TALIESIN: Obviously we're interested in the
prison. We're interested in somehow getting into

3161
03:24:32,105 --> 03:24:38,432
the prison, or possibly getting our problem out of
the prison. I'm not saying that we're looking for

3162
03:24:38,432 --> 03:24:44,111
some sort of grand mastermind or otherwise, but if
you feel that you're the sort of person that would

3163
03:24:44,111 --> 03:24:49,567
have enough information in this direction of how
one might get access to the prison or otherwise,

3164
03:24:49,567 --> 03:24:54,607
and get out with their skin intact-- at least most
of it-- or the sorts of people who would be

3165
03:24:54,607 --> 03:25:00,429
interested in helping such an adventure go
forward, that would be

3166
03:25:00,429 --> 03:25:03,259
worth our while and interesting.

3167
03:25:03,259 --> 03:25:08,781
MATT: Brings up a hand and snaps his finger. As it
does, the entire room around both of you goes

3168
03:25:08,781 --> 03:25:15,221
dark. Jet black. You still see the table before
you, the drinks in your hand, the gentleman across

3169
03:25:15,221 --> 03:25:22,583
the way, but everything else around you just goes
complete, lightless, umbra expanse.

3170
03:25:22,583 --> 03:25:24,562
TRAVIS: I had too much of this wine.

3171
03:25:24,562 --> 03:25:26,550
TALIESIN: I don't think I've had enough.

3172
03:25:26,550 --> 03:25:31,485
MATT: "If we're to speak freely, it's best that we
speak in a place that is safe to speak."

3173
03:25:31,485 --> 03:25:37,212
MARISHA: Oh my god. He fucking teleported you guys
away somewhere.

3174
03:25:37,265 --> 03:25:53,682
MATT: "My cost for my information is high, but I
can both give you what you seek and the means of

3175
03:25:53,682 --> 03:25:58,661
"achieving what you want, but I want a favor in
trade."

3176
03:25:58,661 --> 03:26:06,504
TALIESIN: And I hope-- If you're willing, that if
we decline your offer, I hope you will take no

3177
03:26:06,504 --> 03:26:08,474
offense.

3178
03:26:08,474 --> 03:26:12,130
MATT: "I will take no offense, but those that
listen might."

3179
03:26:12,130 --> 03:26:14,987
TALIESIN: That's fair.

3180
03:26:14,987 --> 03:26:30,771
MATT: "What I'm trying to say is, it behooves you
to make this contract. So. What you seek is the

3181
03:26:30,771 --> 03:26:43,480
"Mentiri. The Mentiri is the prison beneath the
city. I can tell you more, I can get you there. I

3182
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:56,815
"can probably even find out who there knows of or
is involved with this rakshasa. And this favor I

3183
03:26:56,815 --> 03:27:05,804
"ask will lead you to this path." He leans forward
after taking a big sip of his wine, finishing the

3184
03:27:05,804 --> 03:27:21,632
last of it, setting it aside with a heavy (poof)
on the table. "I work for Utugash, one of the

3185
03:27:21,632 --> 03:27:28,910
"prominent owners and taskmasters involved in
moving souls and soul goods throughout this area

3186
03:27:28,910 --> 03:27:42,270
"of Dis. He is slovenly, he is lazy, he is
powerful, and he needs to fall."

3187
03:27:42,270 --> 03:27:44,321
TALIESIN: Is he a pit fiend?

3188
03:27:44,321 --> 03:27:53,917
MATT: "At one time, maybe. At this time, his
laziness has left him a useless sack of demon

3189
03:27:53,917 --> 03:28:04,264
"shit, and I have bent under his fist and brow for
far too long. I have friends now in other places,

3190
03:28:04,264 --> 03:28:16,834
"and if his business were to crumble, that void
left behind could elevate me and my compatriots."

3191
03:28:16,834 --> 03:28:18,666
TALIESIN: Of course.

3192
03:28:18,666 --> 03:28:28,052
MATT: "Now, I have friends in this prison, and the
offense of travelers tearing down someone of

3193
03:28:28,052 --> 03:28:37,369
"prominence, and yourselves being still within your
very mortal coils, why that's what this prison is

3194
03:28:37,369 --> 03:28:46,340
"designed for; for those that break the laws of the
land but haven't yet passed. To be ripened. To be

3195
03:28:46,340 --> 03:29:00,880
"kept, until they do, once the corruption has set
them for the rest of our factory. So, you slay

3196
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:12,797
"this creature, I can see that you are safely
arrested and placed with allies on the inside that

3197
03:29:12,797 --> 03:29:35,964
"could move you around and bring you fairly close
to this rakshasa you seek. That is my offer."

3198
03:29:40,505 --> 03:29:53,190
TALIESIN: This is a fair offer. I will quietly,
without naming names of any kind, confer with my

3199
03:29:53,190 --> 03:30:00,580
compatriots and we will give you a yes or no,
without naming names of any kind.

3200
03:30:00,580 --> 03:30:02,856
MATT: "Very well."

3201
03:30:03,029 --> 03:30:15,973
TALIESIN: Before we leave, and just as a personal
favor. I've been touched by a demon before, by a

3202
03:30:15,973 --> 03:30:22,476
creature. Does it show here? Can you see?

3203
03:30:22,476 --> 03:30:25,361
MATT: He gives you a strong look.

3204
03:30:25,361 --> 03:30:28,428
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull Hex up on myself.

3205
03:30:28,428 --> 03:30:33,288
MATT: At which point, you see his expression
change, and he rears back and goes, "It doesn't

3206
03:30:33,288 --> 03:30:41,154
"show, but the blood ward leaves its scar on many
who exist here. Your essence is not of the Abyss,

3207
03:30:41,154 --> 03:30:48,729
"I would not worry. But do be careful in flashing
such power."

3208
03:30:48,729 --> 03:31:03,506
TALIESIN: I'm thankful. My last question: this
taskmaster of yours, the name you gave me, is it

3209
03:31:03,506 --> 03:31:05,268
his true name?

3210
03:31:05,268 --> 03:31:12,013
MATT: "No. True names, now that is an expensive
trade."

3211
03:31:12,013 --> 03:31:15,083
TALIESIN: One would hope. Would have made our job
much easier.

3212
03:31:15,083 --> 03:31:16,774
MATT: "And mine long ago."

3213
03:31:16,774 --> 03:31:21,658
TALIESIN: Fair. We will meditate upon it.

3214
03:31:21,658 --> 03:31:31,855
MATT: "I will say: beware the Whisperers, the
golden-armored fliers, the watchers of the

3215
03:31:31,855 --> 03:31:41,028
"archdevil himself. His paranoia seeks to know
everything that goes on, and should such treachery

3216
03:31:41,028 --> 03:31:50,486
"that we talk of be revealed, well, that would a
very unfitting end to me, my compatriots, and

3217
03:31:50,486 --> 03:31:53,323
"every one of your friends."

3218
03:31:53,323 --> 03:31:57,843
TALIESIN: I will not speak your name in public. I
will not speak your name in private, to be honest.

3219
03:31:57,843 --> 03:32:01,268
You'll just be Our Friend Downstairs for now.

3220
03:32:01,268 --> 03:32:09,760
MATT: "Avoid the Whisperers." He snaps again and the
sphere of darkness fades, and you're back in the

3221
03:32:09,820 --> 03:32:11,975
tavern, unmoved.

3222
03:32:11,975 --> 03:32:14,382
TRAVIS: Anybody looking at us strange?

3223
03:32:14,382 --> 03:32:20,177
MATT: No. The one person in the room there, the
rather bulky fellow in the corner seems to be

3224
03:32:20,177 --> 03:32:26,520
half-asleep, almost like (sleepy lip smacking).

3225
03:32:26,520 --> 03:32:37,799
TALIESIN: We finish our drinks. Keep an eye on the
door, see if that strange dwarf-like creature

3226
03:32:37,799 --> 03:32:39,444
shows up.

3227
03:32:39,444 --> 03:32:49,227
MATT: You finish your drinks over the next couple
of minutes or so-- it wasn't a heavy pour. Ipkesh

3228
03:32:49,227 --> 03:32:56,978
just intensely, with a slight smile, looks you both
over as you all quietly assess your positions in

3229
03:32:57,031 --> 03:33:01,943
the discussion. No sign of that individual you saw
earlier.

3230
03:33:01,943 --> 03:33:07,055
TALIESIN: All right.

3231
03:33:07,055 --> 03:33:09,113
TRAVIS: I've made up my mind.

3232
03:33:09,113 --> 03:33:10,880
TALIESIN: Well, the rest have to do the--

3233
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:12,513
TRAVIS: No, no, it's you and me down here.

3234
03:33:12,513 --> 03:33:14,134
TALIESIN: No, we're going up.

3235
03:33:14,134 --> 03:33:19,314
TRAVIS: If you want your glasses back, we decide
here and now.

3236
03:33:19,314 --> 03:33:21,820
TALIESIN: That's fair. Let's head upstairs.

3237
03:33:21,820 --> 03:33:24,286
(laughter)

3238
03:33:24,286 --> 03:33:27,010
TRAVIS: Damn it!

3239
03:33:27,010 --> 03:33:32,240
TALIESIN: We head up.

3240
03:33:32,240 --> 03:33:34,310
LAURA: How'd it go?

3241
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:43,731
TALIESIN: Well, our friend downstairs says be
careful of what you talk about out loud. It's

3242
03:33:43,731 --> 03:33:45,481
pretty standard.

3243
03:33:45,481 --> 03:33:48,653
TRAVIS: Apparently people are listening to
everything.

3244
03:33:48,653 --> 03:33:50,039
LAURA: Like in here?

3245
03:33:50,039 --> 03:33:51,437
TALIESIN: Probably in here.

3246
03:33:51,437 --> 03:33:52,540
LAURA: Oh.

3247
03:33:52,540 --> 03:33:55,777
TRAVIS: So no names. No specifics.

3248
03:33:55,777 --> 03:34:00,199
LAURA: God, it's good to be so cool.

3249
03:34:00,199 --> 03:34:03,716
TALIESIN: Well. It's pretty typical.

3250
03:34:03,716 --> 03:34:06,677
MATT: Doty is writing that. Tary goes, "Don't--
don't write that down."

3251
03:34:06,677 --> 03:34:09,999
TRAVIS: How many empty soul stones did she have
while we were gone?

3252
03:34:09,999 --> 03:34:13,187
LAURA: I've had none! This place is just so hot.

3253
03:34:13,187 --> 03:34:19,924
LIAM: So, we switch back to Little Elf Boy, Little
Elf Girl, Antlers, Greg.

3254
03:34:19,924 --> 03:34:23,863
TALIESIN: I definitely would recommend everybody
not use their real names. That's something I

3255
03:34:23,863 --> 03:34:28,393
should've pointed out earlier. Nothing here is
using its real name.

3256
03:34:28,393 --> 03:34:32,461
LAURA: Did you ask him if you don't look like a
tiefling if people are going to notice?

3257
03:34:32,461 --> 03:34:35,545
TALIESIN: I didn't. But I asked him some other
things.

3258
03:34:35,545 --> 03:34:36,746
TRAVIS: I don't think it matters, though.

3259
03:34:36,746 --> 03:34:38,026
TALIESIN: I don't think it matters, either.

3260
03:34:38,026 --> 03:34:39,560
LIAM: What did you find out?

3261
03:34:39,560 --> 03:34:42,815
TALIESIN: Well, there's a prison underneath the
city.

3262
03:34:42,815 --> 03:34:46,074
MARISHA: Yes. Knew that.

3263
03:34:46,074 --> 03:34:55,189
TALIESIN: Our friend says he can probably, very
likely get us in there and get us close enough to

3264
03:34:55,189 --> 03:34:57,136
deal with our problem.

3265
03:34:57,136 --> 03:34:58,174
LAURA: All right.

3266
03:34:58,174 --> 03:34:59,493
TALIESIN: I believe him.

3267
03:34:59,493 --> 03:35:00,715
MARISHA: What's the catch?

3268
03:35:00,715 --> 03:35:01,865
TRAVIS: We gotta kill someone.

3269
03:35:01,865 --> 03:35:04,925
TALIESIN: It's the typical catch. We have to do
him a favor.

3270
03:35:04,925 --> 03:35:07,342
TRAVIS: And then get arrested for it.

3271
03:35:07,342 --> 03:35:10,824
TALIESIN: Or he'll arrange for us to be arrested.

3272
03:35:10,824 --> 03:35:16,382
TRAVIS: I understood that we kill him, then when
we go to the prison, he knows people in the prison

3273
03:35:16,382 --> 03:35:22,512
who would make sure that we find our way to the
right places. But that's the shady part.

3274
03:35:22,512 --> 03:35:24,969
LIAM: Who do we kill? The person you just spoke
to?

3275
03:35:25,036 --> 03:35:25,820
TALIESIN: No.

3276
03:35:25,820 --> 03:35:26,874
LIAM: Someone else?

3277
03:35:26,874 --> 03:35:28,526
TALIESIN: Someone else whose name I will not say
out loud for now.

3278
03:35:28,526 --> 03:35:30,001
LIAM: Okay. But you know it?

3279
03:35:30,001 --> 03:35:31,104
TALIESIN: Yes.

3280
03:35:31,104 --> 03:35:32,223
LIAM: All right.

3281
03:35:32,223 --> 03:35:35,841
LAURA: All right. How would we do that?

3282
03:35:35,841 --> 03:35:38,949
TALIESIN: Well-- How do we ever do anything?
(laughs)

3283
03:35:38,949 --> 03:35:45,605
MARISHA: And why does he want this certain someone
killed? I'm sure it's out of politics?

3284
03:35:45,605 --> 03:35:46,855
TALIESIN: Sure.

3285
03:35:46,855 --> 03:35:47,827
MARISHA: All right.

3286
03:35:47,827 --> 03:35:48,701
TRAVIS: Business.

3287
03:35:48,701 --> 03:35:49,799
MARISHA: Business.

3288
03:35:49,799 --> 03:35:51,809
LIAM: It's just evil versus evil here.

3289
03:35:51,809 --> 03:35:55,120
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's really actually quite
convenient that there's no such thing as the right

3290
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:58,860
thing to do. It just sort of takes so many things
off the table here.

3291
03:35:58,860 --> 03:36:03,194
LIAM: Mm. You're not going to throw a rock and hit
an innocent person in this city.

3292
03:36:03,194 --> 03:36:06,271
TALIESIN: No, the rock is probably the most
innocent person that you're going to throw.

3293
03:36:06,271 --> 03:36:08,549
LAURA: What if somebody threw a rock and hit us?
We're quite innocent.

3294
03:36:08,549 --> 03:36:10,245
LIAM: Right-- Right.

3295
03:36:10,245 --> 03:36:12,767
TALIESIN: It would be a contract, we would be--

3296
03:36:12,767 --> 03:36:13,998
LAURA: Well, Tary is.

3297
03:36:13,998 --> 03:36:15,068
MARISHA: A contract?

3298
03:36:15,068 --> 03:36:16,382
TALIESIN: Everything here is a contract.

3299
03:36:16,382 --> 03:36:18,887
MARISHA: But Tary's exclusive, he can't sign any
more contracts!

3300
03:36:18,887 --> 03:36:20,408
MATT: "That's true! You told me that."

3301
03:36:20,408 --> 03:36:22,138
TALIESIN: He would not be signing the contract.

3302
03:36:22,138 --> 03:36:23,496
LAURA: (whispers) Don't say his name!

3303
03:36:23,496 --> 03:36:26,550
MARISHA: I mean, Barry! Barry's exclusive.

3304
03:36:26,550 --> 03:36:27,739
TALIESIN: Barry Barrington.

3305
03:36:27,739 --> 03:36:29,017
MARISHA: (laughs) Barry Barrington!

3306
03:36:29,017 --> 03:36:31,345
MATT: "I don't like this at all."

3307
03:36:31,345 --> 03:36:33,571
TALIESIN: Chin up, Barry. (laughs)

3308
03:36:33,571 --> 03:36:36,890
MARISHA: Barry Barrington-- (laughs)

3309
03:36:36,890 --> 03:36:39,894
TALIESIN: (chuckles) It's better than--

3310
03:36:39,894 --> 03:36:41,216
MATT: "Don't write that either!"

3311
03:36:41,216 --> 03:36:42,791
TALIESIN: -- Perry Paddington.

3312
03:36:42,791 --> 03:36:44,614
LIAM: Berenstain Bear.

3313
03:36:44,614 --> 03:36:46,925
TALIESIN: Barry Paddington is actually-- has got a
nice ring to it.

3314
03:36:47,037 --> 03:36:49,936
TRAVIS: Well, if we've got your code name, what'll
we call you?

3315
03:36:49,936 --> 03:36:51,053
TALIESIN and LAURA: Freddie.

3316
03:36:51,053 --> 03:36:52,098
TRAVIS: Freddie. Right.

3317
03:36:52,098 --> 03:36:53,177
LAURA: I wouldn't know that--

3318
03:36:53,177 --> 03:36:54,180
TALIESIN: And Greg.

3319
03:36:54,180 --> 03:36:56,320
LIAM: Is that, I mean, that kind of is your name,
is that all right?

3320
03:36:56,320 --> 03:36:59,168
TALIESIN: It's not really, it's a bit of it. It's
off.

3321
03:36:59,168 --> 03:37:01,244
TRAVIS: I still like D-Roll, but whatever.

3322
03:37:01,244 --> 03:37:02,279
LIAM: D-Roll's good.

3323
03:37:02,279 --> 03:37:06,578
TALIESIN: D-Roll's fine, just don't use any real
first or last names, nothing you would sign to a

3324
03:37:06,578 --> 03:37:07,705
piece of parchment.

3325
03:37:07,705 --> 03:37:10,598
TRAVIS: Freddie, how do you feel about this plan?

3326
03:37:10,598 --> 03:37:13,850
TALIESIN: I feel good about it. I feel like it's a
terrible idea.

3327
03:37:13,850 --> 03:37:18,350
TRAVIS: Right. But do you have any amendments to
it? Would you change it somehow?

3328
03:37:18,350 --> 03:37:24,771
TALIESIN: I would just confirm with someone of
reason that we're to do this and get arrested for

3329
03:37:24,771 --> 03:37:27,115
it, or we're to do this and otherwise--

3330
03:37:27,115 --> 03:37:32,127
LAURA: Oh my god, how wonderful would it be if
Scanlan could just Dimension Door-- Oh, I

3331
03:37:32,127 --> 03:37:38,327
shouldn't have said his name. Could just Dimension
Door down to that thing, to the room, and just

3332
03:37:38,327 --> 03:37:40,677
slice up the little egg, and then--

3333
03:37:40,677 --> 03:37:42,469
TRAVIS: Who's to say where he's going?

3334
03:37:42,469 --> 03:37:43,840
LAURA: -- bamf out?

3335
03:37:43,840 --> 03:37:46,289
TALIESIN: Well, we can't, can we?

3336
03:37:46,289 --> 03:37:48,206
LAURA: Probably not.

3337
03:37:48,206 --> 03:37:52,637
LIAM: Also, I'm not trying to prevent us from
following this plan, but we were warned not to

3338
03:37:52,637 --> 03:37:54,678
make any deals with any creature--

3339
03:37:54,678 --> 03:38:00,209
MARISHA: We definitely made a deal between
ourselves before we came down here: no contracts,

3340
03:38:00,209 --> 03:38:01,381
no deals.

3341
03:38:01,381 --> 03:38:02,630
TRAVIS: Right.

3342
03:38:02,630 --> 03:38:03,857
TALIESIN: I didn't agree to that.

3343
03:38:03,857 --> 03:38:05,234
LIAM: So the first thing we do, is--

3344
03:38:05,234 --> 03:38:06,620
MARISHA: Make a contract.

3345
03:38:06,620 --> 03:38:10,175
TALIESIN: Well, look at where we are, to be fair.
I sort of knew we would have to.

3346
03:38:10,175 --> 03:38:15,049
MARISHA: But do we need help getting arrested? I'm
kind of with Grog! All I have to do is walk out

3347
03:38:15,049 --> 03:38:18,342
into the square and open my mouth, and then I'll
get arrested.

3348
03:38:18,342 --> 03:38:22,873
TALIESIN: Do we just want to get arrested? Or do
we want to actually end up where we need to be?

3349
03:38:22,873 --> 03:38:30,008
TRAVIS: So my thought, right? Is that I think we
have to be arrested. Breaking into a prison seems

3350
03:38:30,008 --> 03:38:37,842
real tough. At least with this guy's plan, if he's
lying, the worst we get is just straight-up

3351
03:38:37,842 --> 03:38:41,964
arrested, which I would assume means all our toys
get confiscated, right?

3352
03:38:41,964 --> 03:38:42,991
LAURA: Probably.

3353
03:38:42,991 --> 03:38:47,068
TRAVIS: So, not all of us go on the killing.

3354
03:38:47,068 --> 03:38:53,098
MARISHA: A couple of us go and get arrested--

3355
03:38:53,098 --> 03:39:00,456
TRAVIS: Yeah. And if he's a man of his word, then
those people that are in get led along to this

3356
03:39:00,456 --> 03:39:03,186
magic place where you can go and smash Chicken
Little.

3357
03:39:03,186 --> 03:39:04,710
MARISHA: And the rest of us can follow along?

3358
03:39:04,710 --> 03:39:07,454
TRAVIS: But if he's a lying piece of shit, like
I'm sure everyone else is, we're going to need

3359
03:39:07,454 --> 03:39:08,653
someone on the outside--

3360
03:39:08,653 --> 03:39:12,584
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression that most
people here are painstakingly honest, which is the

3361
03:39:12,584 --> 03:39:14,995
horrifying thing about a place like this.

3362
03:39:14,995 --> 03:39:16,127
TRAVIS: Really?

3363
03:39:16,127 --> 03:39:19,175
TALIESIN: I think that they-- that there's a lot
of lying by omission.

3364
03:39:19,175 --> 03:39:23,418
LIAM: I have a thing. Might be helpful while we're
here.

3365
03:39:23,418 --> 03:39:24,521
LAURA: What is it?

3366
03:39:24,521 --> 03:39:32,346
LIAM: It's a little vial of oil of etherealness.
The oil can cover someone of my size, maybe

3367
03:39:32,346 --> 03:39:36,857
Scanlan's size, and it lets you--

3368
03:39:36,857 --> 03:39:39,511
LAURA: No Scanlan! (laughs) Well, he's not here--

3369
03:39:39,511 --> 03:39:47,941
LIAM: Lets you walk through the Ethereal Plane for
an hour, so you can sort of bypass where you are.

3370
03:39:47,941 --> 03:39:51,440
MARISHA: (whispers) It's like wearing the Ring,
the One Ring.

3371
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:52,835
LIAM: Little bit, yeah.

3372
03:39:52,835 --> 03:39:54,162
LAURA: Like, you walk through walls?

3373
03:39:54,162 --> 03:39:55,633
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, you're walking on a whole
parallel--

3374
03:39:55,633 --> 03:39:56,719
MARISHA: Dimension?

3375
03:39:56,719 --> 03:40:02,805
LIAM: The way it was explained to me, on this
piece of paper, is that you are parallel to where

3376
03:40:02,805 --> 03:40:03,742
you are.

3377
03:40:03,742 --> 03:40:05,508
MARISHA: I will say, having--

3378
03:40:05,508 --> 03:40:07,309
LIAM: Can't pick anything up, I don't think,
can't--

3379
03:40:07,309 --> 03:40:10,980
MARISHA: -- having Truesight, if anything has
Truesight, like the archdevils--

3380
03:40:10,980 --> 03:40:11,854
LIAM: Yeah.

3381
03:40:11,854 --> 03:40:16,018
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure they can see into the
Ethereal Plane, with Truesight. But that's only

3382
03:40:16,018 --> 03:40:20,917
the archdevils who might have it, but it is
illusory magic, I'm pretty sure.

3383
03:40:20,917 --> 03:40:28,042
MATT: How does it say it on the item?

3384
03:40:28,042 --> 03:40:31,018
LIAM: Well, it's the effect of the Etherealness
spell, for one hour.

3385
03:40:31,018 --> 03:40:35,665
MATT: Oh right and so, for that-- the specifics on
that.

3386
03:40:35,665 --> 03:40:40,142
LIAM: I was trying to sprinkle fairy dust on it,
but let's just go to the rules, shall we?

3387
03:40:40,142 --> 03:40:54,004
MATT: Let's see here, 4th-- 8th-level.

3388
03:40:54,004 --> 03:40:57,256
MARISHA: 'Cause I think anything with Truesight
can see into the Ethereal Plane, I think.

3389
03:40:57,256 --> 03:40:59,303
LIAM: This is like Nazgűl KY.

3390
03:40:59,303 --> 03:41:02,830
MATT: Kind of. It says: You remain in the Border
Ethereal for the duration, or until you use your

3391
03:41:02,887 --> 03:41:07,313
action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you
can move in any direction. You can see and hear

3392
03:41:07,313 --> 03:41:12,719
the Plane you originated from, but everything
there looks gray, so yeah, it's like The One Ring,

3393
03:41:12,719 --> 03:41:16,199
but you can shift in any direction. You can
only--

3394
03:41:16,199 --> 03:41:17,795
MARISHA: Is it considered illusory magic?

3395
03:41:17,795 --> 03:41:19,917
MATT: No, Transmutation.

3396
03:41:19,917 --> 03:41:22,012
MARISHA: It is Transmutation.

3397
03:41:22,012 --> 03:41:26,053
MATT: While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only
affect and be affected by other creatures in that

3398
03:41:26,053 --> 03:41:28,533
Plane. Creatures that aren't in the Ethereal Plane
can't perceive you, can't interact with you,

3399
03:41:28,533 --> 03:41:33,212
unless a special ability or magic has given them
the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and

3400
03:41:33,212 --> 03:41:36,277
effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane,
allowing you to move through objects you perceive

3401
03:41:36,277 --> 03:41:38,442
on the Plane you originated from.

3402
03:41:38,442 --> 03:41:41,581
LAURA: God, I really wish we had the stones with
us now.

3403
03:41:41,581 --> 03:41:45,142
LIAM: Yeah, but it's a-- this is a slow-moving
one-way ticket.

3404
03:41:45,142 --> 03:41:46,357
MATT: Yes.

3405
03:41:46,357 --> 03:41:47,485
LIAM: It's an hour.

3406
03:41:47,485 --> 03:41:48,429
LAURA: Yeah, but--

3407
03:41:48,429 --> 03:41:49,431
LIAM: So I could use it--

3408
03:41:49,431 --> 03:41:50,674
LAURA: I mean, you could find your way down
there.

3409
03:41:50,674 --> 03:41:56,890
LIAM: Right, or if we get trapped, one of us could
lather up and get out. I mean, I don't know what--

3410
03:41:56,890 --> 03:42:00,216
we don't really know what we're dealing with yet,
but it's just good to know that we have it in our

3411
03:42:00,216 --> 03:42:02,025
back pocket.

3412
03:42:02,025 --> 03:42:03,886
TALIESIN: Well.

3413
03:42:03,886 --> 03:42:11,056
MARISHA: I mean, with Shapechange, I can change
down to one of these little weird, eight-winged

3414
03:42:11,056 --> 03:42:12,952
insects we've seen flying around.

3415
03:42:12,952 --> 03:42:14,617
TALIESIN: Imps, imps.

3416
03:42:14,617 --> 03:42:15,921
TRAVIS: And do what?

3417
03:42:15,921 --> 03:42:16,913
MARISHA: Get in.

3418
03:42:16,913 --> 03:42:19,274
LIAM: Then change into something bigger and squish
the egg.

3419
03:42:19,274 --> 03:42:20,350
MARISHA: Yeah.

3420
03:42:20,350 --> 03:42:23,656
TALIESIN: You can't think they won't notice that
you're an imp that doesn't belong to anybody?

3421
03:42:23,656 --> 03:42:25,150
LAURA: No, not an imp. It's an insect.

3422
03:42:25,150 --> 03:42:29,499
MARISHA: The little insects that have we've been
seeing flying around that might be little, tiny,

3423
03:42:29,499 --> 03:42:32,400
very tiny imps, I don't know.

3424
03:42:32,400 --> 03:42:35,549
LIAM: I mean, it's not a bad idea. Lot of
variables, but it's a pretty good idea.

3425
03:42:35,549 --> 03:42:37,840
MATT: Do keep in mind, when you Shapechange, you
maintain the hit points of whatever--

3426
03:42:37,840 --> 03:42:41,594
MARISHA: Of whatever I change into. So if I get
down there and I get caught--

3427
03:42:41,594 --> 03:42:44,514
LAURA: You'll bamf into yourself.

3428
03:42:44,514 --> 03:42:54,341
MARISHA: I'll bamf into myself. So, the way
Shapechange works, is whatever I assume first-- we

3429
03:42:54,341 --> 03:43:00,785
need to clarify this later, not now, 'cause it's
like whatever you had before, is what you have. So

3430
03:43:00,785 --> 03:43:05,130
do you just have 1 HP the whole time, based on
whatever you changed into first?

3431
03:43:05,130 --> 03:43:11,384
MATT: Yes. So, if you turn into a dragon with 300
hit points, that's great. The next thing you turn

3432
03:43:11,384 --> 03:43:14,149
into cannot have more than 300 hit points.

3433
03:43:14,149 --> 03:43:15,596
MARISHA: Right, but if it goes down--

3434
03:43:15,596 --> 03:43:19,348
MATT: If it gets damaged down to, say, ten hit
points, and then you turn into a different kind of

3435
03:43:19,348 --> 03:43:21,415
dragon, that dragon will still have ten hit
points.

3436
03:43:21,415 --> 03:43:22,242
MARISHA: Sure.

3437
03:43:22,242 --> 03:43:25,412
MATT: Or if you turn into a fly that has one hit
point max, and then back into a dragon, it'll be a

3438
03:43:25,412 --> 03:43:26,203
dragon with--

3439
03:43:26,203 --> 03:43:28,916
MARISHA and MATT: -- one hit point.

3440
03:43:28,916 --> 03:43:31,368
MATT: You cannot regain hit points by changing
forms with the spell.

3441
03:43:31,368 --> 03:43:32,927
LAURA: Oh, wow.

3442
03:43:32,927 --> 03:43:38,453
MARISHA: But it's whatever I had before. So I
can't change into something awesome, then change

3443
03:43:38,453 --> 03:43:40,031
into something less awesome--

3444
03:43:40,031 --> 03:43:41,785
TALIESIN: Crappy, and then back into something
awesome.

3445
03:43:41,785 --> 03:43:43,037
MARISHA: -- and still have its hit points?

3446
03:43:43,037 --> 03:43:47,519
MATT: You can do it, but you'll-- whenever you
squeeze through to the tiny hit points, those

3447
03:43:47,519 --> 03:43:49,933
carry over into the big creature.

3448
03:43:49,933 --> 03:43:53,995
LIAM: So you're saying you don't bring your 300
dragon hit points down into the fly body, you

3449
03:43:53,995 --> 03:43:56,728
switch to-- you switch to fly hit points.

3450
03:43:56,728 --> 03:43:59,091
MATT: Unless it's the last resort, or you have a
way out, yeah.

3451
03:43:59,091 --> 03:44:06,685
TRAVIS: I think we go perform the hit, and then we
leave Tary, I mean Barry, to get arrested. Right?

3452
03:44:06,685 --> 03:44:09,658
MATT: "Just-- well, no, we're going to do that,
all of us, right?"

3453
03:44:09,658 --> 03:44:12,664
TRAVIS: Like super-secret spy. No, this is a very
privileged role.

3454
03:44:12,664 --> 03:44:13,969
MATT: "Really?"

3455
03:44:13,969 --> 03:44:17,150
TRAVIS: Yep, big-time macho-man stuff.

3456
03:44:17,150 --> 03:44:19,696
MATT: "Are you going to get me out of the
prison?"

3457
03:44:19,696 --> 03:44:20,706
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3458
03:44:20,706 --> 03:44:22,722
MARISHA: Prison Break-style. It'd be so dramatic.

3459
03:44:22,722 --> 03:44:24,431
LAURA: I just don't think we should do that to
Barry.

3460
03:44:24,431 --> 03:44:28,346
TRAVIS: He's ready for more responsibility,
right?

3461
03:44:28,346 --> 03:44:30,390
LAURA: I really don't feel like he is.

3462
03:44:30,390 --> 03:44:36,262
MATT: "I think she might be right in this
instance, but, if we're going together and you

3463
03:44:36,262 --> 03:44:42,534
"guys stay around me. We're a team, right? That's
what teams do, we do things as a team! Vox

3464
03:44:42,534 --> 03:44:43,730
"Machina--"

3465
03:44:43,730 --> 03:44:47,212
LAURA: Don't say our name. Don't whisper.

3466
03:44:47,212 --> 03:44:53,254
MATT: "Grox Dock-in-da-- Stop writing it down,
Doty!"

3467
03:44:53,254 --> 03:44:55,376
MARISHA: Box Cockina.

3468
03:44:55,376 --> 03:44:56,522
TRAVIS: Really?

3469
03:44:56,522 --> 03:44:57,960
LIAM: Whomp-whomp.

3470
03:44:57,960 --> 03:44:59,141
TALIESIN: So, do we say yes to this?

3471
03:44:59,141 --> 03:45:01,271
LAURA: Oh, dear lord.

3472
03:45:01,271 --> 03:45:03,557
LIAM: To doing the hit and then going to prison?

3473
03:45:03,557 --> 03:45:06,056
TALIESIN: Well, what else are we going to do?

3474
03:45:06,056 --> 03:45:07,538
LIAM: Right, no, I'm not arguing.

3475
03:45:07,538 --> 03:45:09,461
TRAVIS: (sings) Don't say no to this.

3476
03:45:09,461 --> 03:45:11,360
TALIESIN: I say yes.

3477
03:45:11,360 --> 03:45:13,700
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too!

3478
03:45:13,700 --> 03:45:18,020
MARISHA: We can also always-- yeah, all right.
Wait, what did we just agree to?

3479
03:45:18,020 --> 03:45:20,234
LAURA: To killing an archdevil.

3480
03:45:20,234 --> 03:45:21,525
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

3481
03:45:21,525 --> 03:45:22,760
MARISHA: We're taking this contract?

3482
03:45:22,760 --> 03:45:24,008
MATT: Not an archdevil.

3483
03:45:24,008 --> 03:45:26,868
LIAM: Wait a second, wait a second. When you
peeked into Hotis--

3484
03:45:26,868 --> 03:45:28,576
MATT: Killing a greater devil. There's a big
difference.

3485
03:45:28,576 --> 03:45:30,083
TRAVIS: Archdevil is the Pope of this area.

3486
03:45:30,083 --> 03:45:33,544
LIAM: When she peeked-- I'm asking Keyleth, but
you might need to come in here with detail. When

3487
03:45:33,544 --> 03:45:38,859
you peeked in at Hotis, what-- Like, how much
security was around him. What was around him?

3488
03:45:38,859 --> 03:45:40,301
MATT: Didn't really see.

3489
03:45:40,301 --> 03:45:42,340
LIAM: Didn't see. Just saw a Cadbury egg.

3490
03:45:42,340 --> 03:45:43,458
MATT: Flashes of interior--

3491
03:45:43,458 --> 03:45:44,604
MARISHA: It comes in pulses.

3492
03:45:44,604 --> 03:45:46,111
MATT: -- and like (bff) and then all of a
sudden--

3493
03:45:46,111 --> 03:45:48,491
TRAVIS: Definitely something big with big, red,
flashing wings, though.

3494
03:45:48,491 --> 03:45:51,327
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah.

3495
03:45:51,327 --> 03:45:54,197
Archdevil or no. Hard to say.

3496
03:45:54,380 --> 03:45:55,973
LAURA: Could be, like, a pit fiend or something.

3497
03:45:55,973 --> 03:46:03,089
MARISHA: I'm getting the idea that maybe Hotis
serves Dispater? Dis--?

3498
03:46:03,089 --> 03:46:04,633
LIAM: Dispater, yeah.

3499
03:46:04,633 --> 03:46:08,826
MARISHA: Yeah. Dispater. Yeah, kind of think he
serves him, so we're kind of maybe going in to

3500
03:46:08,826 --> 03:46:12,913
kill one of his literal secret spies. Think it's
kind of what's going on.

3501
03:46:12,913 --> 03:46:15,559
LIAM: Yeah, that's what we're doing.

3502
03:46:15,559 --> 03:46:24,600
So, kill the thing, get arrested, possible
bug Keyleth, possible ethereal Keyleth as ways to

3503
03:46:24,730 --> 03:46:26,378
get in and out. Possibly.

3504
03:46:26,378 --> 03:46:29,682
MARISHA: I mean, I can always Beast Shape there,
then have Shapechange later. You know, I can do

3505
03:46:29,682 --> 03:46:34,588
the whole be a flying squirrel in someone's
pocket, like we've done before, type of thing.

3506
03:46:34,588 --> 03:46:40,031
LIAM: Yeah. I mean, once we kill this thing, which
we will, we're diving into the unknown.

3507
03:46:40,031 --> 03:46:42,393
TRAVIS: Do we all want to kill the thing?

3508
03:46:42,393 --> 03:46:48,029
TALIESIN: Once we kill this thing, we Plane Shift
out of here faster than you can say-- Oh, oh, we're--

3509
03:46:48,218 --> 03:46:53,772
LIAM: Not Hotis. The contract. To get to Hotis.
That's the owner's--

3510
03:46:53,772 --> 03:47:01,236
TALIESIN: That, we'll confirm with our friend.
That, we'll confirm with our person. And, seem

3511
03:47:01,236 --> 03:47:07,181
like I don't want to use that term too loosely.
We'll see what would be most advantageous for

3512
03:47:07,181 --> 03:47:09,594
getting what we want out of this situation.

3513
03:47:09,594 --> 03:47:12,431
LIAM: All right, so he gets what he wants and then
we see if we get what we want.

3514
03:47:12,431 --> 03:47:15,809
MARISHA: How easy is it going to be to kill
this--

3515
03:47:15,809 --> 03:47:17,970
LAURA: It won't be easy! Let's be honest.

3516
03:47:17,970 --> 03:47:19,160
MARISHA: -- mysterious person?

3517
03:47:19,160 --> 03:47:20,231
LAURA: This is going to suck!

3518
03:47:20,231 --> 03:47:24,966
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, we had a fucking nanny who
used to tell us nightmare stories about this. It's

3519
03:47:24,966 --> 03:47:27,338
way worse than she described it.

3520
03:47:27,338 --> 03:47:28,777
TALIESIN: Pit fiend-ish.

3521
03:47:28,777 --> 03:47:33,357
MARISHA: So, wait, we're expecting two of you to
kill something pit fiend-ish level--

3522
03:47:33,357 --> 03:47:34,676
TALIESIN: No, all of us.

3523
03:47:34,676 --> 03:47:38,705
MARISHA: I-- what? What is happening?

3524
03:47:38,705 --> 03:47:41,038
TALIESIN: All of us. We're going to kill this
thing--

3525
03:47:41,038 --> 03:47:44,700
MARISHA: So we all kill the thing and then two of
you get arrested and then the rest of us follow you?

3526
03:47:44,700 --> 03:47:46,394
TALIESIN and LIAM: All of us get arrested.

3527
03:47:46,394 --> 03:47:47,774
MARISHA: We're all getting arrested now!

3528
03:47:47,774 --> 03:47:48,778
LIAM: Yeah, mm-hm.

3529
03:47:48,778 --> 03:47:50,455
MATT: "That's much better!"

3530
03:47:50,455 --> 03:47:51,800
MARISHA: What happened to like two of us getting
arrested?

3531
03:47:51,800 --> 03:47:53,133
MATT: "That's much better, I like that plan."

3532
03:47:53,133 --> 03:47:56,481
TRAVIS: Explain to me about the contract. So, in
the contract, if he doesn't hold up his end of the

3533
03:47:56,481 --> 03:48:01,254
bargain, like, he explodes or something, right?
It's a magic contract?

3534
03:48:01,254 --> 03:48:03,906
TALIESIN: It will quite possibly be a magic
contract.

3535
03:48:03,906 --> 03:48:05,550
LAURA: You're not going to have to sign anything,
yeah?

3536
03:48:05,550 --> 03:48:08,398
TRAVIS: Because if we get arrested, and they take
all our goodies, and we're in a cell, I'm going to

3537
03:48:08,398 --> 03:48:10,502
kill all of you with my bare hands.

3538
03:48:10,502 --> 03:48:14,313
TALIESIN: We're going to ask him this downstairs.
I just want to take it to you and see if everyone

3539
03:48:14,313 --> 03:48:19,606
thinks that we're going this direction. We'll make
the most comfortable deal we can, but honestly,

3540
03:48:19,606 --> 03:48:22,783
I'm very curious if anybody has any better ideas.

3541
03:48:22,783 --> 03:48:27,086
MATT: "We've already gone to hell. Let's also go
to prison!"

3542
03:48:27,086 --> 03:48:34,684
MARISHA: We could try and just straight-up
espionage--

3543
03:48:34,684 --> 03:48:35,821
TRAVIS: Prison assault.

3544
03:48:35,821 --> 03:48:40,799
MARISHA: -- stealth this. Prison assault, and I
could do a Locate Creature, and we could just

3545
03:48:40,799 --> 03:48:46,364
figure out where Hotis is and try and completely,
yeah, prison break this.

3546
03:48:46,364 --> 03:48:50,439
Without signing any contracts.

3547
03:48:50,439 --> 03:48:54,577
TALIESIN: Full-frontal assault on a demon prison
in the basement of--

3548
03:48:54,577 --> 03:48:57,506
MARISHA: I'm not saying full-frontal, I'm
saying--

3549
03:48:57,506 --> 03:49:00,599
LIAM: Well, walk us through it again. Walk me
through it again, one more time.

3550
03:49:00,599 --> 03:49:03,125
MARISHA: We're stealthy motherfuckers, right?

3551
03:49:03,125 --> 03:49:06,094
TRAVIS: We don't know where the prison is.

3552
03:49:06,094 --> 03:49:10,263
MATT: Tary raises his hand slowly, "Doty, put your
hand up."

3553
03:49:10,263 --> 03:49:14,505
LAURA: These are the least stealthy people I think
I've ever seen, and we know Pike.

3554
03:49:14,505 --> 03:49:18,486
MATT: "I mean no offense, big guy, but--"

3555
03:49:18,486 --> 03:49:19,763
TRAVIS: What?

3556
03:49:19,763 --> 03:49:21,243
MATT: "Nothing."

3557
03:49:21,243 --> 03:49:22,299
LAURA: He's quiet.

3558
03:49:22,299 --> 03:49:23,109
MATT: "Nothing."

3559
03:49:23,109 --> 03:49:23,946
LAURA: He's really quiet.

3560
03:49:23,946 --> 03:49:24,681
MATT: "Su-- Nothing at all."

3561
03:49:24,681 --> 03:49:25,628
LAURA: His boots are made of fur.

3562
03:49:25,628 --> 03:49:26,860
MATT: "I know, they're beautiful. Did you make
those?"

3563
03:49:26,860 --> 03:49:27,790
LAURA: They're very quiet.

3564
03:49:27,790 --> 03:49:28,671
TRAVIS: No.

3565
03:49:28,671 --> 03:49:32,422
LIAM: But you two, Kerry, are very loud. Is what
you're saying.

3566
03:49:32,422 --> 03:49:33,384
LAURA: Yeah.

3567
03:49:33,384 --> 03:49:37,844
MATT: "(squeaky voice) I get nervous."

3568
03:49:37,911 --> 03:49:50,487
MARISHA: Barry, is there any way that you can,
like, (sighs) condense Doty? Put him in your po-- No?

3569
03:49:50,487 --> 03:49:55,473
LIAM: I mean, reality is, two of us are stealthy.
Everybody else is mediocre or worse.

3570
03:49:55,473 --> 03:50:00,034
MARISHA: I'm really good. Okay? Really good. I
know you're talking about you and your sister, but

3571
03:50:00,034 --> 03:50:02,132
I'm really good, too. Just want to point that
out.

3572
03:50:02,132 --> 03:50:03,262
LIAM: Okay.

3573
03:50:03,262 --> 03:50:04,290
TALIESIN: Lava.

3574
03:50:04,290 --> 03:50:07,906
MARISHA: Fuck. Off. Percy. Fuck off.

3575
03:50:08,139 --> 03:50:09,613
LIAM: Wow.

3576
03:50:09,613 --> 03:50:13,136
MARISHA: That had nothing to do with stealth. That
had straight only to do with dexterity, which is

3577
03:50:13,136 --> 03:50:14,676
not my strong suit.

3578
03:50:14,676 --> 03:50:16,903
TRAVIS: Hey, Beekus, you just said his real name.

3579
03:50:16,903 --> 03:50:21,035
MARISHA: (sighs) Freddie. Fuck.

3580
03:50:21,035 --> 03:50:27,309
TRAVIS: So, hey, Freddie, like, how long do you
think guy downstairs will give us to decide?

3581
03:50:27,309 --> 03:50:30,240
TALIESIN: I figure-- Well, if we're going to do
this, I think we should do it quickly.

3582
03:50:30,240 --> 03:50:31,330
LAURA: Oh my god.

3583
03:50:31,330 --> 03:50:32,711
LIAM: Probably listening to us.

3584
03:50:32,711 --> 03:50:37,142
MARISHA: No, they're not. I'm getting--

3585
03:50:37,142 --> 03:50:42,059
TRAVIS: Not supposed to make any deals. We could
just try and do it on our own. The deal might put

3586
03:50:42,059 --> 03:50:44,075
us in a position where we're totally fucked.

3587
03:50:44,075 --> 03:50:45,094
TALIESIN: It might.

3588
03:50:45,094 --> 03:50:48,895
TRAVIS: We don't even know where the prison is.

3589
03:50:48,895 --> 03:50:51,065
MARISHA: (whispers) But we could find out.

3590
03:50:51,065 --> 03:50:51,904
TRAVIS: You think.

3591
03:50:51,904 --> 03:50:53,064
LAURA: Can you cast Locate Creature right now?

3592
03:50:53,064 --> 03:50:54,116
MARISHA: Yes! Yes, I can!

3593
03:50:54,116 --> 03:50:54,975
LAURA: Just cast it and see.

3594
03:50:54,975 --> 03:50:56,074
MARISHA: I 100% can!

3595
03:50:56,074 --> 03:50:56,966
LIAM and LAURA: Let's do it.

3596
03:50:56,966 --> 03:50:58,638
MARISHA: I fucking cast Locate Creature!

3597
03:50:58,638 --> 03:50:59,673
MATT: Okay.

3598
03:50:59,673 --> 03:51:04,838
LIAM: See, part of our problem is sometimes--
always, we grab the first opportunity in front of

3599
03:51:04,838 --> 03:51:06,239
our fucking faces, so--

3600
03:51:06,239 --> 03:51:07,459
TRAVIS: Isn't that the way life is?

3601
03:51:07,459 --> 03:51:08,859
LIAM: Let's explore this opportunity.

3602
03:51:08,859 --> 03:51:12,205
TALIESIN: What level are you casting Locate
Creature at?

3603
03:51:12,205 --> 03:51:13,510
LIAM: 27.

3604
03:51:13,510 --> 03:51:15,973
MARISHA: Level? It's a level two-- a level four
spell.

3605
03:51:15,973 --> 03:51:17,980
MATT: Yep.

3606
03:51:17,980 --> 03:51:19,306
TALIESIN: Will that work on him?

3607
03:51:19,306 --> 03:51:23,632
MATT: You cannot cast it at a higher level. Well,
you can cast it at a higher level, but there's no effect.

3608
03:51:23,632 --> 03:51:24,919
MARISHA: It doesn't do anything.

3609
03:51:24,919 --> 03:51:28,088
TALIESIN: Okay. I was curious if he has a blind
spot or not.

3610
03:51:28,088 --> 03:51:31,955
MATT: All right, so, you take a moment, you finish
casting Locate Creature. You concentrate once

3611
03:51:31,955 --> 03:51:37,494
again on Hotis, keeping a very clear image of what
you saw in the Scry spell. As you complete the spell--

3612
03:51:37,494 --> 03:51:38,833
LIAM: Ho-Dis.

3613
03:51:38,833 --> 03:51:40,189
MATT: -- nothing.

3614
03:51:40,189 --> 03:51:40,985
MARISHA: What?

3615
03:51:40,985 --> 03:51:43,030
LAURA: Because it's a level fucking four.

3616
03:51:43,030 --> 03:51:44,037
TALIESIN: It's all right.

3617
03:51:44,037 --> 03:51:45,631
MATT: Well, the creature has to be within 1000
feet.

3618
03:51:45,631 --> 03:51:46,547
LAURA: Oh.

3619
03:51:46,547 --> 03:51:48,866
MARISHA: And it has to be within-- But it lasts
for an hour. It's a concentration spell.

3620
03:51:48,866 --> 03:51:50,074
MATT: It is.

3621
03:51:50,074 --> 03:51:56,054
TRAVIS: Just take off running around the city,
man. Boom! Marathon Woman. Go get it.

3622
03:51:56,054 --> 03:51:58,067
MARISHA: I can fly. I can look and fly.

3623
03:51:58,067 --> 03:51:59,305
TALIESIN: Turn into an imp.

3624
03:51:59,305 --> 03:52:01,615
TRAVIS: (sings) She's a maniac, man-- oh, he's
down there!

3625
03:52:01,615 --> 03:52:06,799
MARISHA: I could go right now and fly around while
it lasts for an hour. Do a quick scout.

3626
03:52:06,799 --> 03:52:07,997
TRAVIS: How do you fly?

3627
03:52:07,997 --> 03:52:11,215
MARISHA: With fucking Beast Shape by being like a
beasty thing.

3628
03:52:11,215 --> 03:52:12,745
TRAVIS: Can you do that and concentrate at the
same time?

3629
03:52:12,745 --> 03:52:14,109
MARISHA: Yeah. That's at-will.

3630
03:52:14,109 --> 03:52:17,970
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure off, go on. Fly off by
yourself, nobody cares.

3631
03:52:17,970 --> 03:52:19,221
LIAM: I'll go with her.

3632
03:52:19,221 --> 03:52:20,676
TRAVIS: How do you go?

3633
03:52:20,676 --> 03:52:23,828
LAURA: You're not a-- well, it doesn't matter.

3634
03:52:23,828 --> 03:52:25,535
LIAM: I'm not what? What am I not?

3635
03:52:25,535 --> 03:52:26,598
LAURA: A tiefling anymore.

3636
03:52:26,598 --> 03:52:27,488
MARISHA: Yeah.

3637
03:52:27,488 --> 03:52:30,367
LIAM: I know. But she's a big fucking bird, I
mean--

3638
03:52:30,367 --> 03:52:33,417
MARISHA: I don't have to be a big fucking bird--

3639
03:52:33,417 --> 03:52:34,421
LAURA: She could be a succubus.

3640
03:52:34,421 --> 03:52:36,473
MARISHA: -- I could be literally a tiny fucking
bird, or a succubus.

3641
03:52:36,473 --> 03:52:37,345
LIAM: All right, do your thing.

3642
03:52:37,345 --> 03:52:42,784
MARISHA: If I am a succubus, though, it's burning
my 9th-level spell and we're done for the night.

3643
03:52:42,784 --> 03:52:47,941
TRAVIS: You get captured or eaten out there, we're
done for the night anyway. (laughs)

3644
03:52:47,941 --> 03:52:48,858
TALIESIN: Fair.

3645
03:52:48,858 --> 03:52:50,448
LIAM: Hell is tearing this team apart.

3646
03:52:50,448 --> 03:52:52,635
MARISHA: What were the weird imp things that I saw
flying around?

3647
03:52:52,635 --> 03:52:53,788
TRAVIS: Imps.

3648
03:52:53,788 --> 03:52:55,068
LAURA: Those are the golden armored things

3649
03:52:55,068 --> 03:52:56,117
MARISHA: The gold armor imps.

3650
03:52:56,117 --> 03:53:00,225
MATT: There are impish creatures with golden armor
that you saw at a distance in the sky above.

3651
03:53:00,225 --> 03:53:02,500
LAURA: Was there anything else flying other than
them?

3652
03:53:02,500 --> 03:53:05,599
MATT: There were other creatures flying, but they
were too far away to really make up any decent--

3653
03:53:05,599 --> 03:53:08,098
and some of them of them were just imps, just the
tiny little devils that fly around, and there were

3654
03:53:08,098 --> 03:53:12,299
some that seemed a little larger with humanoid
bodies and giant, leathery wings that were just

3655
03:53:12,299 --> 03:53:13,901
coasting through.

3656
03:53:13,901 --> 03:53:17,291
LIAM: And you said this is like the biggest city
we've ever seen?

3657
03:53:17,291 --> 03:53:18,030
MATT: Yeah.

3658
03:53:18,030 --> 03:53:19,545
MARISHA: There are things that fly here?

3659
03:53:19,545 --> 03:53:22,045
MATT: There are many things that fly. The first
thing you saw when you looked up in the sky was at

3660
03:53:22,045 --> 03:53:24,765
least a dozen or so winged creatures all up in the
clouds.

3661
03:53:24,765 --> 03:53:29,576
LAURA: Oh, god.

3662
03:53:29,576 --> 03:53:32,336
MARISHA: I can go. Going to the window. Anyone
stopping me?

3663
03:53:32,336 --> 03:53:33,910
LAURA: There's no window, it's just wall.

3664
03:53:33,910 --> 03:53:38,169
MARISHA: There's no windows. Anyone stopping me as
I Alter Self and--

3665
03:53:38,169 --> 03:53:39,586
TRAVIS: This is your game, go for it.

3666
03:53:39,586 --> 03:53:40,819
MARISHA: -- head towards the door? No?

3667
03:53:40,819 --> 03:53:41,594
TRAVIS: Do it.

3668
03:53:41,594 --> 03:53:45,861
MARISHA: No one? All right, I'm going to go do a
quick pass. (laughs)

3669
03:53:45,861 --> 03:53:47,837
LIAM: Oh, gosh. Be careful.

3670
03:53:47,907 --> 03:53:49,560
TRAVIS: Have that backup character ready.

3671
03:53:49,560 --> 03:53:51,119
(laughter)

3672
03:53:51,119 --> 03:53:54,727
LAURA: She becomes leader of the Ashari and dies
as soon as she gets to hell.

3673
03:53:54,903 --> 03:53:55,625
TALIESIN: One day.

3674
03:53:55,625 --> 03:53:57,458
TRAVIS: Go get it, keep going. Momentum!

3675
03:53:57,458 --> 03:54:01,871
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right, all
right, all right. I'm going to Shapechange.

3676
03:54:01,871 --> 03:54:04,144
MATT: You're casting Shapechange, okay.

3677
03:54:04,144 --> 03:54:05,253
MARISHA: Level nine.

3678
03:54:05,253 --> 03:54:08,718
MATT: All right, what are you turning into?

3679
03:54:08,718 --> 03:54:14,665
MARISHA: I'm going to do a succubus. I know I've
got a good look at them and they can fly.

3680
03:54:14,665 --> 03:54:18,025
LAURA: Wait, are succubuses devils down here or
are they demons?

3681
03:54:18,025 --> 03:54:18,899
MARISHA: They're devils.

3682
03:54:18,899 --> 03:54:20,129
LIAM: Those are devils, and we saw one under
Krieg's house.

3683
03:54:20,129 --> 03:54:21,152
MATT: They're fiends.

3684
03:54:21,152 --> 03:54:22,332
LAURA: Okay. They're fiends.

3685
03:54:22,332 --> 03:54:27,848
MARISHA: And they're kind of rogue agents. I'm
hoping no one questions this.

3686
03:54:27,848 --> 03:54:29,507
MATT: Okay. So you have succubus.

3687
03:54:29,507 --> 03:54:34,121
MARISHA: Shit. Okay. Mm. Just-- quick loop.

3688
03:54:34,121 --> 03:54:35,359
LIAM: Ermahgerd.

3689
03:54:35,359 --> 03:54:36,332
MATT: Okay.

3690
03:54:36,332 --> 03:54:37,287
TRAVIS: Yeah, ermahgerd--

3691
03:54:37,287 --> 03:54:38,509
LAURA: Ermahgerd.

3692
03:54:38,509 --> 03:54:44,961
MARISHA: I, as the tiefling, walk out of the
tavern, just very intent on my direction. As I

3693
03:54:44,961 --> 03:54:53,136
walk out of the building, I take a left, hang down
an alleyway, check over my shoulder, make sure no

3694
03:54:53,136 --> 03:54:56,597
one's watching and then (fwoof) into a succubus
and take off.

3695
03:54:56,597 --> 03:54:58,494
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check real fast.

3696
03:54:58,494 --> 03:55:00,536
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh god.

3697
03:55:00,536 --> 03:55:01,701
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

3698
03:55:01,701 --> 03:55:03,774
TALIESIN: Fucking hell is right.

3699
03:55:03,774 --> 03:55:08,674
TRAVIS: (sings) Highway to the danger zone.

3700
03:55:08,674 --> 03:55:20,086
MARISHA: Just a straight-- oh, that's good, that's
good. 20 total. No, no, 21 total.

3701
03:55:20,086 --> 03:55:21,073
MATT: Okay.

3702
03:55:21,073 --> 03:55:23,722
MARISHA: I forgot my proficiency bonus went up.

3703
03:55:23,722 --> 03:55:33,362
MATT: As you exit the building and turn right and
into the alleyway, being careful not to be seen in

3704
03:55:33,362 --> 03:55:39,800
your tiefling form, begin to cast the spell as you
see two shadows step into the

3705
03:55:39,800 --> 03:55:42,466
entranceway of the alleyway.

3706
03:55:42,466 --> 03:55:43,703
MARISHA: Nope. I stop it.

3707
03:55:43,703 --> 03:55:45,137
MATT: Okay. So you stop it?

3708
03:55:45,137 --> 03:55:46,996
MARISHA: Yep, and I just kind of keep walking.

3709
03:55:46,996 --> 03:55:50,444
MATT: You just keep walking? Okay. You don't even
look back, you just keep walking?

3710
03:55:50,444 --> 03:55:51,440
MARISHA: Yes.

3711
03:55:51,440 --> 03:55:54,470
MATT: Okay. Keep walking, and you hear footsteps
behind you.

3712
03:55:54,470 --> 03:55:56,676
MARISHA: I start blocking around.

3713
03:55:56,676 --> 03:56:01,818
MATT: Okay. As you go blocking around, the
footsteps seem to be keeping pace with you.

3714
03:56:01,818 --> 03:56:03,826
There's two sets of them.

3715
03:56:03,826 --> 03:56:08,455
MARISHA: Peek over my shoulder. Do I get a glimpse
on who they are?

3716
03:56:08,455 --> 03:56:12,932
MATT: You see what appears to be a squat, kind of
tan-skinned dwarf-like figure.

3717
03:56:12,932 --> 03:56:14,281
MARISHA: It's the dwarf again.

3718
03:56:14,281 --> 03:56:21,056
MATT: The features, like you expect to see a
dwarf, appears to be a female dwarf of some kind,

3719
03:56:21,231 --> 03:56:27,270
but there's some sort of physical alteration's
taken place. They look like they've been either

3720
03:56:27,270 --> 03:56:32,542
very injured and healed wrong, or some sort of
corruption has taken place. But it's walking

3721
03:56:32,542 --> 03:56:37,698
forward with this hobbling gait, and to the left
you see the other entity that is just wrapped in

3722
03:56:37,698 --> 03:56:40,071
chains, and they're about 30 feet behind you.

3723
03:56:40,071 --> 03:56:43,345
MARISHA: 30 feet behind me?

3724
03:56:43,345 --> 03:56:44,675
MATT: About 30 feet behind you, yeah.

3725
03:56:44,675 --> 03:56:45,699
MARISHA: Are we alone?

3726
03:56:45,699 --> 03:56:49,201
MATT: It's just you and the two of them right now.
Just in this small alleyway off in the building

3727
03:56:49,201 --> 03:56:52,979
that's immediately adjacent to the structure where
you're staying.

3728
03:56:52,979 --> 03:56:56,143
MARISHA: I'm still, I imagine, within range of the
tavern?

3729
03:56:56,143 --> 03:56:57,057
MATT: Yeah.

3730
03:56:57,057 --> 03:57:03,715
MARISHA: Just gonna say, I'm being followed so be
on alert. Same dwarven chainy figure.

3731
03:57:03,715 --> 03:57:04,627
LAURA: Should we come out?

3732
03:57:04,627 --> 03:57:05,754
LIAM: Do you need us out there?

3733
03:57:05,754 --> 03:57:08,123
MARISHA: No, just wait a second, I'll say Jenga if
need be.

3734
03:57:08,123 --> 03:57:13,171
TALIESIN: Stretching.

3735
03:57:13,171 --> 03:57:24,176
MARISHA: I stop, about-face, and light up my hands
and keep the hood up. And just say, I know you're

3736
03:57:24,176 --> 03:57:32,493
there. What do you want, and who are you? Keep the
hood up.

3737
03:57:32,493 --> 03:57:42,250
MATT: Head's down. The footsteps slow when they
get about 20 feet from you. And they stop. You

3738
03:57:42,250 --> 03:57:50,821
keep your head down. The dwarf figure brings one
weird, swollen, twisted arm in front of the other,

3739
03:57:50,821 --> 03:58:00,625
crosses it. The chained figure, you hear all the
jangling, shifting, and as you get a better glance

3740
03:58:00,625 --> 03:58:06,002
over your shoulder towards it, you can see the
chains that dangle don't just dangle, they're all

3741
03:58:06,002 --> 03:58:11,435
kind of slowly shifting and spinning around, like
hundreds of small snakes that are just readjusting

3742
03:58:11,435 --> 03:58:18,433
and moving across the body. You can see its eyes,
part of its nose through as the chains pull across

3743
03:58:18,433 --> 03:58:28,434
and hide most of its features. The skin itself a
deep, deep pinkish-red, like a normal body that's

3744
03:58:28,434 --> 03:58:32,521
been constricted so much that all the blood has
rushed to the surface.

3745
03:58:32,521 --> 03:58:37,453
MARISHA: Off-the-cuff, do they seem familiar? Any
idea on who they might be?

3746
03:58:37,453 --> 03:58:45,053
MATT: No. But there is a heavy breathing from the
female dwarf figure that just-- they glance at

3747
03:58:45,053 --> 03:58:46,815
each other.

3748
03:58:46,815 --> 03:58:51,017
MARISHA: I say, do you want to tell me? You want
to tell me who you are? 'Cause I don't have a lot

3749
03:58:51,017 --> 03:58:53,302
of time to deal with this.

3750
03:58:53,302 --> 03:59:00,818
MATT: The chained one says, "You seem to walk with
a white one."

3751
03:59:00,818 --> 03:59:05,630
MARISHA: Who's asking?

3752
03:59:05,630 --> 03:59:08,762
MATT: "I am asking."

3753
03:59:08,762 --> 03:59:15,091
MARISHA: 'I' could be referred to many people,
including myself. So I am asking--

3754
03:59:15,091 --> 03:59:23,651
MATT: "Silence. You will bring us the white one,
or you will be tribute yourself."

3755
03:59:23,651 --> 03:59:26,640
MARISHA: What do you want with him?

3756
03:59:26,640 --> 03:59:30,150
MATT: There's no response.

3757
03:59:30,150 --> 03:59:36,178
MARISHA: I don't think you'd want me as tribute,
so you'd best bet tell me what you want with him,

3758
03:59:36,178 --> 03:59:39,202
because maybe we could strike a deal.

3759
03:59:39,202 --> 03:59:49,729
MATT: "The white one caught the attention of a
creature that I wish to see pleased."

3760
03:59:49,729 --> 04:00:00,267
MARISHA: Well, is this creature willing to make a
deal? Because the white one belongs to me.

3761
04:00:00,267 --> 04:00:03,328
MATT: "You have ownership of the white one?"

3762
04:00:03,328 --> 04:00:06,585
MARISHA: Of course.

3763
04:00:06,585 --> 04:00:09,487
MATT: Make a deception check.

3764
04:00:09,487 --> 04:00:11,589
LIAM: It's not really lying.

3765
04:00:11,589 --> 04:00:23,594
MARISHA: (laughs) It's not really a-- Not great.
Six total.

3766
04:00:23,594 --> 04:00:27,824
(laughter)

3767
04:00:27,824 --> 04:00:30,563
MARISHA: It's not entirely wrong, though.

3768
04:00:30,563 --> 04:00:48,633
MATT: "Hm." You hear the chains intensify with the
rattling and clanking. "Perhaps you should walk

3769
04:00:48,633 --> 04:00:50,608
"with us."

3770
04:00:50,608 --> 04:00:53,019
MARISHA: Where are we going?

3771
04:00:53,019 --> 04:00:57,303
MATT: "To the one who wishes to now know of your
ownership."

3772
04:00:57,303 --> 04:01:05,739
MARISHA: And if I decline?

3773
04:01:05,739 --> 04:01:10,933
MATT: "Then you will no longer be able to stop
us."

3774
04:01:10,933 --> 04:01:14,268
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I still didn't catch your
name.

3775
04:01:14,268 --> 04:01:21,328
MATT: "You do not need our name."

3776
04:01:21,328 --> 04:01:22,941
And that's where we're going to leave tonight's
episode.

3777
04:01:22,941 --> 04:01:24,010
(all groan)

3778
04:01:24,010 --> 04:01:24,994
MARISHA: Oh, what?!

3779
04:01:24,994 --> 04:01:27,141
TALIESIN: Yeah! I love Hells, man.

3780
04:01:27,141 --> 04:01:32,248
MATT: It's 11AM, or 11PM, and that's a fun place
to pick up next week.

3781
04:01:32,248 --> 04:01:35,562
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Oh no!

3782
04:01:35,562 --> 04:01:38,613
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3783
04:01:38,668 --> 04:01:41,981
TRAVIS: I could be many people, it could all f--
Silence!

3784
04:01:41,981 --> 04:01:44,131
(laughter)

3785
04:01:44,131 --> 04:01:46,358
TALIESIN: Or that, okay.

3786
04:01:46,358 --> 04:01:51,331
MARISHA: It's kind of a pejorative, you know. Do
we need to know like-- what kind of "I"? Is this

3787
04:01:51,331 --> 04:01:52,759
this royal "I"?

3788
04:01:52,759 --> 04:01:54,502
TRAVIS: It's royal "we".

3789
04:01:54,502 --> 04:01:55,732
MARISHA: The royal "we"?

3790
04:01:55,732 --> 04:02:01,131
MATT: Shapechange, how you force me into bringing
even more minis to the game every week.

3791
04:02:01,131 --> 04:02:02,807
(laughter)

3792
04:02:02,807 --> 04:02:03,859
MATT: Just in case.

3793
04:02:03,859 --> 04:02:04,783
TRAVIS: Multiple bags.

3794
04:02:04,783 --> 04:02:05,817
TALIESIN: We can leave them here now.

3795
04:02:05,817 --> 04:02:06,726
MATT: I'm doing that.

3796
04:02:06,726 --> 04:02:11,156
MARISHA: I didn't burn the spell, right? I stopped
it, I didn't burn the spell, I stopped it. Right?

3797
04:02:11,156 --> 04:02:18,496
Because I was like "Cancel cancel cancel", come
on, man.

3798
04:02:18,496 --> 04:02:20,262
TALIESIN: My vibe is it didn't burn.

3799
04:02:20,262 --> 04:02:21,477
MARISHA: I thought it didn't burn either.

3800
04:02:21,477 --> 04:02:27,267
MATT: I will say, just for the sake of this, for
the sake of-- this roll will determine this.

3801
04:02:27,267 --> 04:02:29,910
Roll-- what's your passive perception actually?

3802
04:02:29,910 --> 04:02:31,529
MARISHA: My passive perception?

3803
04:02:31,529 --> 04:02:32,302
MATT: Yes.

3804
04:02:32,302 --> 04:02:33,653
MARISHA: Pretty good.

3805
04:02:33,653 --> 04:02:36,308
TALIESIN: You've got to do something about that.
That's becoming a problem.

3806
04:02:36,308 --> 04:02:37,283
MARISHA: Shut up.

3807
04:02:37,283 --> 04:02:38,453
LAURA: Shut up. (laughs)

3808
04:02:38,453 --> 04:02:39,739
MARISHA: 21.

3809
04:02:39,739 --> 04:02:42,724
MATT: 21? I'll say you cancelled it, you did
manage to just catch their movement out of the

3810
04:02:42,724 --> 04:02:48,783
corner of your eye, just as you entered the
alleyway, and you-- just as you were about to

3811
04:02:48,783 --> 04:02:50,466
begin the spell, they arrived.

3812
04:02:50,466 --> 04:02:51,691
MARISHA: All right.

3813
04:02:51,691 --> 04:02:56,049
MATT: That's only because they didn't roll very
high stealth themselves. Well, cool!

3814
04:02:56,049 --> 04:02:57,034
MARISHA: Fucking hell.

3815
04:02:57,034 --> 04:03:03,191
MATT: Thank you guys so much. Literally. Fucking
