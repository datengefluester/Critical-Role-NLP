1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,987
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:09,096
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah! Before we get started

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:15,489
for the day, let's get into some of our quick
announcements. First off, happy to be back. Me,

4
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:20,386
Marisha, and Taliesin were gone for a better part
of two weeks. We missed you guys. We actually met

5
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,297
a few Critters around the desert with us.

6
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:23,536
LAURA: Oh, really?

7
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:24,682
MATT: Yeah.

8
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:26,200
LIAM: You were in Connecticut for a week, right?

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,179
MATT: Yeah!

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,157
TRAVIS: Were they dressed up like they were from
Marquet?

11
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,394
MATT: Basically, yeah.

12
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,632
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

13
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,448
MATT: (laughs) It was really cool but we were
happy to be back--

14
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,193
TALIESIN: How do you want to burn this?

15
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:38,667
TRAVIS: Spice? Spice? Spice?

16
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,949
MATT: Spice? Spice? Spice? Do you spice?

17
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,397
LAURA: Everybody spices at Burning Man. I'm pretty
sure.

18
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:49,464
MATT: Sam will be about an hour late tonight.
Unfortunately, he has work pushing later in the

19
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:52,448
evening than normally would be, but he'll be
joining us as soon as he possibly can. So

20
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:59,205
he'll be on his way. Let's see, also a big round
of applause for Liam running an awesome one-shot

21
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:02,098
last week. Once again, well done, man.

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,343
LIAM: I just wanted to see Travis show his true
self.

23
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:09,016
TRAVIS: I don't know what you mean, sir.

24
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,559
TALIESIN: No spoilers!

25
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,635
LIAM: It worked.

26
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:19,940
MATT: Oh, it's great. Anyway, let's get back in
the swing of things here. Announcements real fast

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,673
if you want to start with this, Travis.

28
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:26,572
TRAVIS: Yes! Our week's amazing episode is brought
to you by Loot Crate! And their theme for this

29
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:31,743
month, the month of September, is Speed. They've
got amazing, high-octane titles like: Speed,

30
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:35,846
Battlestar Galactica, Iron Man, Gone in 60
Seconds, Arrow, Batman, CW's The Flash, plus many more.

31
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,831
LAURA: The fastest things ever!

32
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,757
TRAVIS: I'm telling you, like that announcement.
They got collectibles, a figure, and as always, a

33
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:43,644
monthly t-shirt that looks amazing.

34
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,411
MARISHA: Yeah. It's always stylish.

35
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:49,870
TRAVIS: You can get your hands on some of that
sweet, nasty Loot Crate swag by going to

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:57,062
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole for $3 off your
monthly subscription. You do it. You get it. And

37
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:00,933
Goku's on the table. He stays--

38
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,093
LAURA: Because you bite Goku through the game. I
don't understand it.

39
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,514
TRAVIS: He's got pointy hair. I like chewing on
things!

40
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:11,097
MARISHA: So wait, has this been an ongoing thing.
Did this start last week and I missed it?

41
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:18,256
TRAVIS: If it's not that, it's pen or pencils. I
digress. Loot Crate, thank you!

42
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:21,536
TALIESIN: Loot Crate: you can put it in your
mouth!

43
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,625
TRAVIS: You can?

44
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:28,541
TALIESIN: You do! Probably shouldn't, but you can.

45
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:33,979
MATT: Marisha, did you want to talk a little bit
about a cool thing we have coming up now?

46
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:39,988
MARISHA: I do. We have a new product that we're
coming out with. We teamed up with our friends

47
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:47,341
over at Espionage Cosmetics to come out with
Critical Role nail wraps! We've got make-up now

48
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,351
because that's how cool we are.

49
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,098
LAURA: They look really, really awesome.

50
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:57,226
MARISHA: Yes, and so there's some that are blue
with our logo on them on silver. And then we have

51
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:59,233
red ones that say "How do you want to do this?"

52
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,057
TALIESIN: It's like a blood red with a little bit
of black splatter--

53
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:06,470
MARISHA: And they glow in the dark. What?

54
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,713
TRAVIS: They do?

55
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,898
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yes, they do.

56
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,373
LAURA: Shebang! This is the blood splatter one.

57
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,536
MARISHA: And when you open the package, they're
brought to you--

58
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,047
TALIESIN: Can you do it?

59
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:23,444
MARISHA: Yeah, I got this. I always rip them. But
when you open it, they're from Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

60
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,608
TRAVIS: Oh snap!

61
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,738
LAURA: There he is on the inside.

62
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,389
MARISHA: Yeah, brought to you Gilmore.

63
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,620
MATT: Pretty fantastic.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,058
LAURA: That's so awesome, man.

65
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:37,062
MARISHA: Uh-huh. So yes, you can go get them right
now. They are available tonight.

66
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:39,507
LAURA and MARISHA: In the store.

67
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:43,651
MATT: So you can go ahead and make sure your nails
look absolutely glorious.

68
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:49,936
MARISHA: And we tried to make them like unisex
because people like Taliesin like to rock the nail wraps.

69
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:51,510
TALIESIN: Yes I do. I love rocking nail wraps.

70
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,456
LAURA: I have a feeling you would rock the nails,
wouldn't you, Liam?

71
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,646
LIAM: Unicorn sex?

72
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:05,202
LAURA: What? Anywho, also available in the store
tonight is a plethora of new merchandise for you

73
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:10,453
guys. I know we've had a lack of it lately. Okay,
I've got to say it all because it's really

74
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:16,191
exciting. Okay, we have these badges, they come in
a set of five--

75
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,631
TRAVIS: Hold your badges up.

76
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:18,704
LIAM: Badges?

77
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:21,652
LAURA: Oh, I took yours. They come in a set of
five, they were limited edition at Comic Con so we

78
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:25,245
have some left and so we put them in the store.
They're super awesome. So those are available

79
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,854
right now, but they are limited.

80
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,830
TRAVIS: How do you want to do this, Gilmore's
Glorious Goods, the Slayer's Take.

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,021
LAURA: What's the other thing that's limited? Oh,
the nail wraps, right.

82
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,940
MARISHA: Oh, also there are Geek and Sundry nail
wraps.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,340
TALIESIN: There also are some new Geek and Sundry
nail wraps that have a blue and white thing and

84
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,147
the little logo and I haven't seen if they're glow
in the dark yet and I haven't looked yet, but I

85
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,864
definitely have an outfit that these are going to
work with so I'm taking these home.

86
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,089
MARISHA: Okay.

87
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:51,588
LAURA: We also have the rings back in stock.

88
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,296
MARISHA: What?

89
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:59,686
LAURA: Don't, baby, don't flip off everybody. So
those we have a limited amount of-- Don't! I had a

90
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,003
fly on my food.

91
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:02,603
TRAVIS: A one?

92
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,431
LAURA: Oh no, you really did roll a one!

93
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,985
TRAVIS: This shit never ends.

94
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:12,305
LAURA: Those are limited. Also, something that's
going to be in store for a long time is my

95
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:22,468
favorite thing ever, the Critical Role mug. As
seen on Blindspot by Patterson. Yeah, so we

96
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:28,331
finally had these in the store and these are made
to order, but they are going to stay in the store

97
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,737
so order them and whatever. In addition to those,
we have things on pre-order that are going to stay

98
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:38,649
in the store for a couple weeks and that is this
amazing bracelet. You can check it all out at the

99
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,728
store. It's there right now. It says "How do you
want to do this?" it's got our logo on it, how

100
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:42,860
badass is that?

101
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,074
TRAVIS: We already have ours because they're
amazing. It's got like a raised CR too.

102
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:50,231
LAURA: And these are on pre-order too. You know
you can't see them on this shot, I'm sure it's not

103
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:54,159
close enough, but you can go on the store and you
can see an awesome view of them and they're enamel

104
00:05:54,159 --> 00:06:00,490
pins of our logo and also a "How do you want to do
this?" So you can put them on your jean jacket or

105
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,480
your backpack or your hat.

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,633
LIAM: Like flair.

107
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,825
LAURA: Like flair. You can wear them on your apron
if you work at Bennigan's or TGI Fridays.

108
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:12,737
TRAVIS: Rep your CR love, we'll slap your hands.
Like in a high five, not in a bad way. Like slap hands.

109
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,834
LAURA: So that's all the amazingness that we
have.

110
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,093
LIAM: These are sick.

111
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,166
LAURA: That's a lot.

112
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,560
TALIESIN: No, I know it's been slowly building and
it's this sudden--

113
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,347
LIAM: Making it rain!

114
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,394
MARISHA: All the shit. Live crit strong.

115
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:27,774
MATT: That's Travis for the rest of the game.

116
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:31,158
TRAVIS: My OCD wife will slaughter me.

117
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,373
LAURA: Yeah, I really will.

118
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:39,463
MATT: Good. It never ceases to be the strangest
thing to see a phrase that I organically made up

119
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:45,333
in my home game is now on patches and pins. It's
so weird. That's so weird.

120
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,726
TALIESIN: I'm glad that we finally have these. We
had to fight to get these at Comic Con.

121
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:50,801
MATT: Yeah.

122
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,259
(phone notification beep)

123
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,586
LAURA: Who didn't silence their phone?

124
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:54,896
MARISHA: It's always Tal.

125
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:56,007
TALIESIN: It's Sam, though!

126
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:56,919
LAURA: Oh, is he here?

127
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,369
TALIESIN: He's heading this way in about 20
minutes, so he should be here 20 minutes after that.

128
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,082
LIAM: He's just leaving El Segundo.

129
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:11,148
MATT: All right guys, that being the case, let's
go ahead and bring it down unless we have any

130
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,827
other announcements. Do we have anything else?

131
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:13,740
TRAVIS: Negative.

132
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,058
LAURA: No. No, no, no.

133
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,628
MATT: All right, let's bring it in after a two
week pause to the main story of Vox Machina,

134
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,944
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

135
00:07:20,944 --> 00:08:51,348
[dramatic music]

136
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:57,872
MATT: Welcome back. So, last we left off, Vox
Machina, in their perpetual quest to take down the

137
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:02,011
Chroma Conclave and the path of destruction
they've swept across all of Tal'Dorei and

138
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:09,085
continents beyond, they found themselves going to
the continent of Marquet, across the central

139
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:17,496
desert, meeting the parents of Gilmore, and coming
to the city, the jewel of Marquet known as

140
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:22,883
Ank'Harel. You found yourself wandering the
streets, meeting curious individuals. Our gnome

141
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:30,868
apparently has made a spice deal that is to come
to fruition at some point in the near future. In

142
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:38,265
search of the bearer of one of the Vestiges of
Divergence you have been seeking, in preparation

143
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:42,768
of your battle with Thordak, as well as seeking
allies in this strange, new interesting city.

144
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:51,056
Through the continuous and perpetual threat of
evil forces in the world, you found a hookah bar

145
00:09:51,056 --> 00:10:02,258
and got fuzzy drunk on a form of sandkheg-based
liquor. You learned a bit about the city, about

146
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:10,505
the culture, you learned from Jarett some good
possible tips on how to engage with the people

147
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,858
around the town.

148
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:12,983
LAURA: Oh, be pleased.

149
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,107
MATT: Yes, be pleased.

150
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,649
LIAM and TRAVIS: Beep-beep.

151
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,983
MATT: And you guys made your way towards the
Cerulean Palace in the center of the city. After

152
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:27,659
being balked by the Hand of Ord upon arrival you
were then greeted by the Grand Maven and given

153
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:35,326
entry to the Cerulean Palace. Upon passing up a
large translucent blue tower, above the city of

154
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,620
Ank'Harel-- not Emon, I was tired--

155
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,844
MARISHA: We knew what you meant.

156
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:44,891
MATT: I know, I figured you guys would be all
right with that. And eventually opened into a

157
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:51,806
central chamber at the very top of this tower that
overlooks the majority of the desert from this

158
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:59,521
position that you can see. There were large
windows across the entirety of this circular room,

159
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:06,404
there was a raised platform in the center, balcony
across the opposite way, and sitting atop this

160
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:15,117
throne in the center made of brass and sapphire
you met an individual, seemingly the ruler for a

161
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:23,210
long time of this city. The androgynous
long-living figure known as J'mon Sa Ord. And that

162
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,776
is we're picking up this--

163
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,260
TRAVIS: And the Grand Maven took us up there?

164
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,280
MATT: Yes.

165
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,760
MARISHA: And we saw him and we met him, right? He
was like "hello."

166
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,266
MATT: Just greeted you when we left off.

167
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,953
LAURA: He knew who we were.

168
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,057
MARISHA: Right.

169
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:40,420
MATT: He? She? You're not quite sure what the sex
is of this figure specifically. The fine features,

170
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:48,266
elongated limbs, and long dark hair seem to
deflect trying to pin down a lot of details about

171
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:55,393
the history or source of where this individual
came from. However, they have risen from the

172
00:11:55,393 --> 00:12:05,805
throne, bowed deeply, and greeted you, "Welcome to
Ank'Harel, heroes of Tal'Dorei. I am J'mon Sa Ord.

173
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:16,136
"It is my pleasure to greet you," and gave you a
soft bow. "Your arrival has not escaped my

174
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:21,646
"whispers and I'm curious if your presence means
what I think it means."

175
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:27,711
LAURA: What do you think it means exactly?

176
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:34,743
MATT: "I have heard our skyport access to Emon was
balked by dragon attack. I would hope the problem

177
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:43,491
"would be sorted by now for the purposes of our
vast trade network. And you've arrived, I hope

178
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,946
"with good news."

179
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:49,089
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, it's like a mixed bag. A little
good, a little bad.

180
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,978
MARISHA: Hmm, I'd say it's mostly bad.

181
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,479
TRAVIS: It's mostly bad.

182
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,145
TALIESIN: It's good news in progress.

183
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,990
MARISHA: Hmm, mostly bad.

184
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,664
TALIESIN: My version of good news in progress.

185
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:02,709
LAURA: We are making headway. We've taken down
one.

186
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:11,844
TALIESIN: We have a problem that, as far as I
know, has never been accounted for in the

187
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:18,755
history of civilization. The dragons are
cooperating with one another. We are fighting not

188
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:29,338
one dragon, but a conclave of dragons. All
cooperating towards the destruction and

189
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:31,704
sublimation of man.

190
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,792
MARISHA: It seems as if this is an extermination.

191
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:38,250
LIAM: Mostly successful.

192
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,910
TALIESIN: Mostly.

193
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,907
LAURA: They mostly come at night.

194
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,290
TRAVIS: Mostly.

195
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,737
TALIESIN: They plan at dawn.

196
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:53,791
MATT: "So you say these dragons are working
together, attacking and destroying. I assume they

197
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,508
"are of the chromatic origin then?"

198
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,539
LAURA: Yes.

199
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:05,004
MATT: "Working together is quite strange. Hmm.
What else can you tell me of this threat?"

200
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:11,957
LAURA: A great ancient red one known as the Cinder
King is sitting on Emon.

201
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:15,099
MARISHA: He appears to be their leader.

202
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:22,676
TALIESIN: He was released somehow from the Plane
of Fire.

203
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,742
LAURA: By a green dragon, Raishan.

204
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:34,791
MATT: "Raishan. I do not recognize this name. What
is the name of the red you speak of, this Cider King?"

205
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,558
TRAVIS: Thordak.

206
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:45,658
MATT: There's a subtle reaction from the creature
before you. Draws back and narrows their gaze a

207
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:57,983
bit at the mention of the name. "Thordak, yes.
(scoffs) I recall this name. A foolish drake from

208
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:08,949
"the Scaldwind Sands who saw, unwisely, to threaten
my domain many years ago. We cut his heart and

209
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:14,861
"watched him sink beneath the ocean. This creature
you speak of, I do not think it is the same

210
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,085
"Thordak."

211
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:17,506
TRAVIS: No?

212
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:20,545
MARISHA: Why wouldn't it be?

213
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,057
MATT: "Because I watched him die."

214
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:29,178
TRAVIS: Oh! But our Thordak, he has like this
thing that is at the center of his chest right?

215
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,533
It's like a jewel.

216
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,539
LAURA: It's replaced his heart, potentially.

217
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:37,732
TRAVIS: And if you sliced his original maybe he
upgraded.

218
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,187
TALIESIN: Or perhaps someone brought him back to
life.

219
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:42,312
LAURA: Not unheard of.

220
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:48,123
MATT: "So this beast that harries you, you are
certain it goes by the name Thordak?"

221
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,733
LAURA: Certain.

222
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:53,390
MATT: "What proof do you have of this being the
same beast?"

223
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:01,836
TALIESIN: Other than his heart obviously having
been previously maimed in some way, we have no

224
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:06,671
proof that it could be the same beast. We were not
here. But even if it isn't the same beast, the

225
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:11,233
fact that a dragon takes its name should trouble
you.

226
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:19,607
LIAM: And we've heard of your success before and
were hoping you could offer us a little guidance.

227
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,519
TALIESIN: It is an old dragon--

228
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:30,737
MATT: "The Thordak that came to war here was not
quite as large and powerful as you seem to

229
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,513
"say this one is."

230
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,435
LAURA: How long ago was it?

231
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:41,777
MATT: "This was centuries ago, the city was but
maybe 100, 150 years at the time."

232
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,736
LAURA: He could have grown by then.

233
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:48,710
MARISHA: Yes, I'm afraid we're not talking about a
drake anymore, we're talking about an ancient,

234
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,394
full-grown dragon.

235
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:54,268
TALIESIN: God knows how time works in the Fire
Elemental Plane, he may be much older than time

236
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,789
has allowed.

237
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:59,410
TRAVIS: With respect, you were here centuries
ago?

238
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,754
MATT: The creature known as J'mon Sa Ord, they
steeple their fingers and glance over to you-- at

239
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,828
head height with you practically, even stepping
down from the platform.

240
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,154
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

241
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,706
MATT: "I have been here for some time, yes."

242
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:18,188
TRAVIS: I've got to get your diet sometime, that's
amazing.

243
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:24,042
TALIESIN: Grog, in general it is impolite to query
the age of any being. In general.

244
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,691
TRAVIS: Oh right.

245
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,599
TALIESIN: I would have assumed you would know that
by now.

246
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,523
TRAVIS: (stammers) Beep-beep.

247
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:36,781
MATT: The still-narrowed black eyes, with a tiny
pinpoint of molten metal peeking through, relax.

248
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:45,545
The arms go from a steepled position to a cross
and now a look of curiosity comes across their

249
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:55,712
face. "If this is truth, then how do you plan to
fell this everburning worm?"

250
00:17:55,712 --> 00:18:06,648
LAURA: That is the question, isn't it? We're
collecting items. Vestiges of power. Hopefully

251
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:15,481
with them in tow, we will be able to gather armies
to combat Thordak. We know we can't take him on

252
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:17,069
alone.

253
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:21,109
TALIESIN: We're also gathering allies and we've
already destroyed several of his companion

254
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,646
dragons.

255
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:23,987
MATT: "You have?"

256
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:24,924
TALIESIN: We have.

257
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,080
LAURA: Well, a couple.

258
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,153
TRAVIS: And we did recon on a third.

259
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:31,049
TALIESIN: Preparing to kill a white dragon.

260
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:38,954
MATT: "So am I to understand that you are
spearheading this endeavor?"

261
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,714
MARISHA: Well. It's sort of unofficially.

262
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:43,769
TALIESIN: We're as surprised as anyone, yes.

263
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,827
MARISHA: You know, we didn't necessarily ask for
this, it just fell in our lap.

264
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,854
TRAVIS: It fell on our city, actually.

265
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:56,900
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true. Our keep came crashing
down on around us and then we were committed.

266
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,904
MATT: "Very well, then what do you want from J'mon
Sa Ord?"

267
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:10,253
TALIESIN: Perhaps, if it comes to it, a little bit
of help possibly collecting the Vestige that we

268
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:15,816
are looking for in this city, that we are
currently, hopefully, collecting and being on our

269
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:23,219
way with, causing as little noise in the city as
humanly possible. We are aware that is complicated

270
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:31,985
for people like us. And perhaps an ally in the
coming battles to come. It may, I would imagine,

271
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:38,382
please you to perhaps meet these dragons on
foreign shores as opposed to in your city walls.

272
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:42,983
LAURA: It's only a matter of time. If we can't
defeat them in Emon, he will spread his

273
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,354
territory.

274
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:48,087
TALIESIN: If it is the dragon that you remember, he
will come here, and if it isn't the dragon you

275
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,735
remember, the fact that he took that name means
that he will come here.

276
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:57,297
MATT: "This city is well protected. I am not
worried about this dragon or dragons you speak. I

277
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:01,838
"am protector here and we are warded against such
threats."

278
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:05,049
LIAM: But you would like to awaken trade with Emon
again, yes?

279
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:13,165
MATT: "This does interest me as there is quite a
stake in the roads we've built with Tal'Dorei."

280
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:19,963
LIAM: Is there anything you can share with us from
your encounter back then? It would help.

281
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:32,390
MATT: "The creature once known as Thordak had
begun to grow tired of his meager dominion in the

282
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:44,079
"Scaldwind Sands, began to reach out with his many
feral kobold armies and various serpentine

283
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:55,370
"followers, decided that the very jewel of our city
was perhaps a good throne to sit upon. And, much to

284
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:03,865
"its foolish intent, attacked not knowing what it
was after. We struck down its armies and for two

285
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:11,853
"weeks there was battle between the skies of here
and the northern mountains before we took a fell

"strike against the beast. It escaped to the north
and attempted to flee beyond the ocean's waters,

287
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:26,929
"but we caught up to it, struck it down, and
watched it fall into the fathoms. If this is the

288

"same beast you say, then it is uncanny it could
survive such an encounter and would say it is even

289
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:38,781
"more dangerous having learned from these past
struggles."

290
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:45,413
LIAM: Do you think you simply wore it down or was
there some angle you used?

291
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:55,195
MATT: "I have my ways. We have our ways. Well, you
wish my aid?"

292
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:56,738
TALIESIN: We do.

293
00:21:56,738 --> 00:22:00,654
MATT: "You go running into the furnace and you
wish me to be at your side?"

294
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:07,953
LAURA: Well, we don't run into the furnace
willingly.

295
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,167
TRAVIS: Or hastily.

296
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:13,361
TALIESIN: The furnace is the only exit. We wish to
just borrow an asbestos coat.

297
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:25,032
MATT: "Hmm." There's a brief pause as J'mon looks
past and seems to peer through each of you,

298
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:30,320
scanning back and forth with those strange smoldering
pupils.

299
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,710
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

300
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:42,480
MATT: "You look able-bodied and strong of will.
However, I have watched many of your kind with

301
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:52,817
"these same traits waltz into oblivion before. I
will not risk myself or my city by backing a

"fool's whim. Show me what you are capable of,
fellows of Vox Machina. Show the Soul of the

303
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:10,523
"Desert Jewel what you are capable of." And J'mon
Sa Ord begins to step back--

304
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,445
(mechanical whirring)

305
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:15,554
MATT and LAURA: What is that?

306
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:17,827
LIAM: What strange powers do you wield?

307
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:21,830
TALIESIN: He's using a hydraulic pump! He's an
imagineer!

308
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,340
TRAVIS: He's omnipotent!

309
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,017
MARISHA: It's animatronic!

310
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:33,176
TRAVIS: That was like the best sound cue ever.

311
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:39,898
MATT: You hear the cracking and the rumbling of
something in the distance as J'mon Sa Ord steps

312
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:42,446
back and fades from view.

313
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,623
LAURA: Ugh, come on!

314
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:50,589
MATT: You hear a latching of stone behind you as
it seems the Grand Maven has stepped back into the

315
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:53,306
platform you arrived in and closed it behind you.

316
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,632
TRAVIS: Oh good.

317
00:23:54,632 --> 00:24:02,098
MATT: Another loud crack hits the air around you
(loud grinding) and you watch as, over past the

318
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:09,287
other side of the room where the balcony stands, a
looming shadow plummets out from seemingly the

319
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:17,113
sky itself and lands, smashing onto the marble
floor of the exterior, its silhouette humanoid,

320
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:21,968
but swollen, across the sunlight that's pushing
past from beyond.

321
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:25,372
TRAVIS: Sam is here, somebody go get Sam! Sam's at
the door.

322
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:30,389
MATT: Blue dust and pebbles tumble across the
archway from the balcony to your side coming to

323
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:39,084
rest. The shape squeezes through the balcony arch
into the room. What you see is a thick-limbed

324
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:45,482
silhouette marching into the throne chamber, a
15-foot-tall armored structure of intricate

325
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:52,169
decorated cobalt plates and iron bulk dragging a
massive cleaver-like blade with one arm and a

326
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:56,909
clenched boulder-like fist in the other. Two
burning white flames flare as eyes within its

327
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,367
solid helmet. I need you all to roll initiative.

328
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:03,095
TRAVIS: What? Man, you just got back in town!

329
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,584
LAURA: We just got here!

330
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:06,353
LIAM: Fetch the gnome!

331
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,472
MARISHA: The gnome is just in time.

332
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:09,902
TRAVIS: And a map?

333
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:11,793
LAURA: Why don't we have Fassbender with us?

334
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,187
MARISHA: Oh yeah, where is Fassbender?

335
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,149
TALIESIN: Fassbender is busy being a good guy.

336
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,003
MARISHA: Fassbender's with Wilhand.

337
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:19,210
ALL: Hey!

338
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,483
LAURA: Sam, we're all going to die!

339
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:24,725
MARISHA: We just rolled initiative.

340
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:29,303
SAM: So I have some questions for the leader of--
oh, what?

341
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:32,986
TRAVIS: Some shit went down, he asked us--

342
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:35,822
SAM: I know. I'm with this.

343
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:38,808
TALIESIN: I brought you some stickers from Burning
Man.

344
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:40,289
SAM: Thank you.

345
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,211
TRAVIS: I got you.

346
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:47,864
MATT: Apparently the character minis were not
brought to the table. Be with you in a moment when

347
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:49,437
those arise.

348
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:54,323
LIAM: Got to shake off that Burning Man.

349
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:55,899
MARISHA: He's like a big iron samurai.

350
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,296
TALIESIN: That is everything I've ever hoped for.

351
00:25:57,296 --> 00:26:00,451
LIAM: Percy wishes he created that.

352
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:04,585
TALIESIN: I am definitely having a little bit of
Tony Stark porn moment right now. I want to wear

353
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:05,923
it like a suit.

354
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:09,952
MATT: Initiative orders. 25 to 20.

355
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,770
LAURA: Anybody? 25 to 20?

356
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,343
SAM: Wait, let me roll this.

357
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:17,015
LAURA: Wait, let me see. Oh, I think he got
something good. No.

358
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:20,426
LIAM: What did you roll? What did you roll, Grog?

359
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:21,585
TRAVIS: 17.

360
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:24,460
MATT: 25 to 20. No one? 20 to 15.

361
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,590
TALIESIN: 18.

362
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,622
LAURA: 17.

363
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:27,746
LIAM: 19.

364
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:31,090
LAURA: Oh, I was wrong. 14. I added wrong. Shit.

365
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,444
LIAM: 19.

366
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:33,690
TRAVIS: 17.

367
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,944
MATT: What did you get, Percy?

368
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,031
TALIESIN: 18.

369
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,481
MATT: 18, right. Okay, so Vax, Percy, Grog.

370
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:43,647
TRAVIS: That thing is huge.

371
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:48,717
MATT: All right, 15 to ten.

372
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:50,167
MARISHA: 12.

373
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,904
SAM: 14.

374
00:26:51,904 --> 00:27:06,952
LAURA: 14 as well! All right, here we go. And then
a fucking 20 again as soon as I--

375
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:12,739
SAM: (sings dramatic music)

376
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,634
TALIESIN: The sound of you slowly dying.

377
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,914
LAURA: What are those clear blocks? Are those
glass?

378
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,530
MATT: Those are the windows.

379
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,450
TALIESIN: That's like the DND version of those
awful glass bricks from the 80s.

380
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:28,950
MATT: Keyleth, 12?

381
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,305
MARISHA: Yeah, 12.

382
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,102
MATT: All right and what did you get again?

383
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,332
LAURA: 14.

384
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:37,352
SAM: And he's a test? We're not to kill anyone
else in the room?

385
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:38,314
MARISHA: Right.

386
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:40,304
TALIESIN: I don't think he's real, we just have to
kill him.

387
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:48,494
MATT: As the entity bursts its way into the room,
its flaming eyes flare. Vax, you have the

388
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:51,740
beginning of this encounter, what do you want to
do?

389
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:58,751
LIAM: Going to click the boots together and I'm
going to slide over this way, between those two

390
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:00,192
windows I'm closest to.

391
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:01,301
MATT: Between there?

392
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:06,328
LIAM: Yeah. All the way to the wall.

393
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:07,515
MATT: All the way to the wall?

394
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:08,397
LIAM: Yeah.

395
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,393
MATT: Right there?

396
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:10,231
LIAM: Yeah.

397
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,712
TRAVIS: (singing) To the windows!

398
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:16,855
LIAM: I'm going to dagger and dagger and dagger
him. Okay, first one is 24.

399
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:17,966
MATT: Hits!

400
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:23,519
LIAM: Second one I'm going to reroll with Luck.
Second one-- Balls! It's 16.

401
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,444
MATT: Is this your last Luck of the day? Because
you haven't rested.

402
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:28,442
LIAM: That's two. That's my second. I've been checking
them off.

403
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:29,069
MATT: Second? Okay.

404
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:30,612
LIAM: The third one is 24 as well.

405
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,617
MATT: All right, so what was it? 24?

406
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:37,208
LIAM: It was 24, 15 or 16, and 24 again.

407
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,463
MATT: So second one misses. The first and last
hit.

408
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:56,537
LIAM: First and last. Okay. Give me the pyramid
and I go and get nine, plus I have advantage so I

409
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:05,042
get sneak attack, so that's nine plus 14, 19, 20,
26, 30-- 36 for the first.

410
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,151
MATT: What was that?

411
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,708
TRAVIS and LIAM: 36.

412
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,172
LIAM: And the second gets ten.

413
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:17,109
MATT: All right, 46 points of damage, first round
of attacks from Vax. Well done. The blades hit and

414
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:22,090
streak off, and you can see portions of the iron
plates between the cobalt armor seem to have

415
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:28,768
carved grooves into them and it's actually made an
impact on the outside of the creature. That end

416
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,894
your turn?

417
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,035
LIAM: That ends my turn.

418
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,475
MATT: All right, Percy, you're up.

419
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:37,468
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to, first of all, cast
Hex on this creature.

420
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:39,894
TRAVIS: Attaboy!

421
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:43,983
LAURA: Thanks for the reminder, because now I'm
going to do Hunter's Mark.

422
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:50,975
TALIESIN: Going to cast my Hex and then I'm going
to start gentle. I'm going to take three shots

423
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:55,522
with the Retort pistol, including the first one is
going to be an attempt at a headshot.

424
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:56,799
MATT: Okay.

425
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,278
TALIESIN: So that's a burn a grit. Come on, I know
it's been two weeks. Don't be angry. Don't be a

426
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:10,355
cat, be a dog, just be happy to see me. And it's happy
to see me! That's a 31.

427
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:11,725
MATT: 31 hits.

428
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:29,065
TALIESIN: My cats were not happy. That's terrible!
Hold on. Sorry. That's 12 points of piercing

429
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:33,732
damage-- oh no, sorry, that's seven points of
piercing damage, five points of necrotic damage.

430
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,681
And he has disadvantage on strength checks.

431
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,177
MATT: Okay! Disadvantage on strength checks.

432
00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:41,654
TALIESIN: And he has to make a constitution saving
throw.

433
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,074
MATT: Okay. That is a 22.

434
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:47,151
TALIESIN: I don't like him.

435
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:53,793
MATT: As a note: the first shot, it hits the head
and bounces off, seemingly no effect. There's a

436
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:58,454
little bit of necrotic seep into the armor that
seems to have affected it to a small extent, but

437
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:01,401
the bullets seem to have almost no effect on its
form.

438
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,613
TRAVIS: Really?

439
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:04,939
SAM: But Liam's did?

440
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,885
TALIESIN: No, yeah, Liam's not doing piercing
damage.

441
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:12,425
LAURA: Yes he does, he does piercing damage. But
it seemed to get through less than--

442
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,919
LIAM: Magic?

443
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,595
MARISHA: Are your bullets not magic?

444
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:21,348
TALIESIN: The bullets are not magic. My bullets
are bullets!

445
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,610
SAM: Maybe it's because they're projectiles?

446
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,248
TALIESIN: Okay, good to know! That could go really
poorly!

447
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:29,564
MARISHA: Is he made of metal? Or is he a big dude
in a metal suit?

448
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:30,877
TALIESIN: We don't know.

449
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:32,169
MATT: You don't know.

450
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:39,827
TALIESIN: So that's good to know. I'm going to
take another shot at the helmet for a headshot.

451
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,027
MATT: Okay.

452
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:42,593
TRAVIS: Spread. Out.

453
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,429
LAURA: Where? I don't even see where we are!

454
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,213
TRAVIS: We're over there, in front of the throne.

455
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:48,254
TALIESIN: 27.

456
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,913
MATT: 27 hits!

457
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:57,047
TALIESIN: Better! 16 points of piercing damage,
three points of necrotic. And another constitution

458
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:58,318
saving throw.

459
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:02,404
MAT: Constitution saving throw. That is an 18.

460
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:07,290
TALIESIN: He now has disadvantage on attacks until
the end of his next turn.

461
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,972
MATT: Okay. This one does hit the head, and it
seems to knock it off to the side and one of the

462
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:17,115
flames flutters for a second, but leaves no impact
or damage against the helmet.

463
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:20,553
TRAVIS: You are kidding me. So is it fair to say
that 16 points of damage didn't happen?

464
00:32:20,553 --> 00:32:27,077
TALIESIN: At the moment, I'm blowing bullets not
for damage; I'm blowing bullets for effect at the

465
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:31,351
moment. This is all effect-based, I'm not trying
to damage him right now.

466
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:34,316
MARISHA: (singing) She blinded me with science!

467
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:37,653
TALIESIN: (singing) Blinded me with science! I
have one more shot, so I guess I'm going to take

468
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:48,147
it. And for shits and giggles, I'm going to take a
Sharpshooter shot.

469
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:50,159
MATT: Okay.

470
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:58,354
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 19. 27?

471
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:00,103
MATT: 27 hits.

472
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:06,987
TALIESIN: 21 points of piercing damage, four
points of necrotic.

473
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:12,335
MATT: Okay. Once again it ricochets off with a
flash of sparks and energy. You can see the

474
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:17,162
necrotic seems to have left this slight burn
against the plate, but the bullet has left no

475
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,697
groove in the armor.

476
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:26,622
TALIESIN: All right, that's cool. I'm putting the
gun down, and I'm going to back up. I'm going to

477
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:31,865
pull to my left. And I'm going to try and get
against the wall, not the glass!

478
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:35,906
MATT: All righty. End of your turn?

479
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:36,929
TALIESIN: End of my turn.

480
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,416
MATT: Grog, you're up.

481
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:47,337
TRAVIS: It's time to wake up, boys and girls! So I
would like to rage. Am I in front of the throne?

482
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:53,618
That's me, right? That big, proud fuck over there?
Can I run as far as my little feet can carry me,

483
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:56,820
over in front of Percy and more towards along the
wall?

484
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:04,252
MATT: Okay, so. (counting) 50 is where you can get
right there.

485
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:08,071
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's cool. I'm cool with that. I'm
not in front of that window, right? More in front

486
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,466
of the wall?

487
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,199
MATT: It's just to the right of you.

488
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,903
TRAVIS: Okay, sweet. May I attach the Chain of
Returning to my bloodaxe, and throw it at said

489
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,446
giant bastard?

490
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:20,904
MATT: You may! What is the range on it?

491
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:29,952
TRAVIS: 120 feet, on the Chain of Returning. Yes.
No. Is that right?

492
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:34,151
MATT: No, that's not right. I thought it was 30,
it's a pretty short distance to throw it.

493
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,666
TRAVIS: Oh shit, is it? I don't have it!

494
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,300
SAM: It's like a thousand feet.

495
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,598
TRAVIS: We're a little rusty.

496
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:43,610
LAURA: How tall would you say this guy is?

497
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,688
MATT: This guy? 15 feet.

498
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:49,803
LAURA: He's 15 feet tall, Grog. 15 feet.

499
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:57,939
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Chain of Returning! It doesn't
say! It must be attached. Melee weapon. Thrown.

500
00:34:57,939 --> 00:35:02,701
Bonus action: athletics strength check provided to
pull the thing out. No distance. It's even

501
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,653
laminated.

502
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,107
MATT: Okay. It's a 30-foot distance, just like
most throwing weapons would be.

503
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:11,317
TRAVIS: Damn it. You know what? Since I'm raging,
I take out the Javelin of Lightning and I'll throw that!

504
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,959
MATT: All righty!

505
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:20,293
TRAVIS: That'll work. Oh, and I'll make it a
reckless attack. That's good because that's a two.

506
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:22,189
And that's a four.

507
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,614
LAURA: Oh my god, is this is the dice that was
fucking you last week!?

508
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:29,357
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I've got a lot to-- no, it's
not! Don't start with your juju. It's 18.

509
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:35,991
MATT: 18. As you throw the javelin, it hits the
shoulder pauldron and scrapes off, firing out of

510
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,739
the balcony, and over the edge

511
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:47,836
LAURA: No! Accio Lightning Javelin. He just lost
the Lightning Javelin out the window.

512
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:50,538
SAM: Jesus. We'll get it later, we'll go get it
later.

513
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:52,467
TALIESIN: That's what you get for playing with it
in the house.

514
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,700
TRAVIS: That ends my turn.

515
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,203
LIAM: Six seconds later: (screams).

516
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,234
(laughter)

517
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,693
MARISHA: Sorry, Steve!

518
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,951
LIAM: "I'm all right!"

519
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:06,267
MATT: All righty. It is now the cobalt golem's
turn.

520
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:15,036
LAURA: Okay. I like how we're clustered right
there. It's fun, it's really fun. Yay.

521
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:22,202
MATT: It's dragging the cleaver behind it,
scraping it across the grounds of this palace room

522
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:30,322
as it moves. As it comes sauntering up, its large
leg movement, taking large strides against the

523
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:35,363
floor, leaving a small crack under each footfall.
It turns around. The blade isn't getting ready to

524
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:41,344
fight, instead its flames curl up and darken, and
you watch as its neck opens up to this dark space

525
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:50,496
underneath and it (roars). This fume of purplish
blue mist seems to spill out in front of it.

526
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:51,899
LAURA: No!

527
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,670
TRAVIS: Oh no, he's reaching for something.

528
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,107
LAURA: Oh no! Area of effect.

529
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:03,799
SAM: As he attacks, can I use Cutting Words to
reduce the attack?

530
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,288
LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan, do that!

531
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:06,900
MATT: You are more than welcome to try.

532
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,809
TRAVIS: That's a no.

533
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,342
SAM: I'll try.

534
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:12,252
MATT: So you use your Cutting Words.

535
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:20,918
SAM: Yeah, I say to him, oi! Your face is so ugly
I'm considering casting Blindness on myself so I

536
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:22,659
don't have to look at it!

537
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:25,646
(laughter)

538
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:32,063
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll the dice.

539
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:33,709
SAM: A ten or an eight?

540
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,142
MATT: d10, it's whatever your bardic inspiration
is.

541
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:37,633
SAM: Hey, six!

542
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:44,910
MATT: Has no affect on it, unfortunately. All right, I
need Vex, Keyleth and Scanlan to make

543
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,512
constitution saving throws.

544
00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:50,026
LAURA: Oh no! I hate constitution saving throws!

545
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:52,834
TALIESIN: That's not terrible.

546
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,881
SAM: I got a natural 20!

547
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:59,256
MATT: Damn, all right!

548
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:00,693
MARISHA: 17 total.

549
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:01,908
LAURA: 19.

550
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:06,015
MATT: Okay. This is a lot of dice I've got to roll
here, so let me--

551
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:10,323
LAURA: Oh no! How many is a lot?

552
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:24,750
MATT: (counting) So as the poisonous fumes fill
the space, you can feel it burning the outside of

553
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:30,611
your skin, filling your lungs. You guys start
coughing as the horrible burning sensation in your

554
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:35,489
interior begins to fill your entire experience
right now. Scanlan, you manage to pull aside and

555
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:39,659
close your nose just in time, but it still burns
your exterior. You take 26 points of poison

556
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:45,794
damage, Scanlan. That is 55 points of poison
damage to both Vex and Keyleth.

557
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:49,684
LAURA: On a 19? I didn't save?

558
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:54,330
MATT: 20 DC. You missed it by one.

559
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,289
MARISHA: Did you say 55? That just dropped me by
half my hit points.

560
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,125
LAURA: Yeah, basically me too. More than half.

561
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:05,524
MATT: That's going to end its turn. Vex, you're
up.

562
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:08,661
TRAVIS: Least you fell in love before you died.

563
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,087
(laughter)

564
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,039
LAURA: Is he within five feet? Can I get away from
him?

565
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,846
MARISHA: Fuck you, Travis.

566
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:18,425
MATT: You would take an attack of opportunity if
you do.

567
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:22,288
One more rogue level.

568
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:29,426
LAURA: I'm going to hope that he doesn't hit me
and I'm going to try and run away from him.

569
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:31,645
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage.

570
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:33,588
LAURA: Okay, does he?

571
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,922
TALIESIN: Yeah, he has disadvantage on swinging at
you.

572
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:41,395
MATT: He does, yes. So as you start rushing away,
the one lax arm holding the cleaver goes (cleaver

573
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:47,625
slamming) and comes down over her head like a
giant, thick, three-and-a-half-foot-wide blade of

574
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:55,057
solid iron. With disadvantage, that's 25 to hit.

575
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:58,257
SAM: Whoa! This is a powerful fighter!

576
00:39:58,257 --> 00:40:01,526
LAURA: He hits me. Watch me die right now!

577
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:05,282
MARISHA: He's right, we're not ready. We're stupid
assholes, oh God!

578
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,104
TRAVIS: We're going to do drugs in your lounges
for the rest of our lives.

579
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:11,390
LAURA: If he kills me right now, I'm going to be
so pissed.

580
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,041
MATT: You take 29 points of bludgeoning damage.
Not bludgeoning, sorry, slashing damage, as the

581
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:20,419
blade strikes down, slicing right across your
front torso, nearly throwing you to the ground and

582
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:24,033
you can already feel the blood fill up in your
mouth and begin to drip down the side of your

583
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:27,792
chin, but you do manage to pull away from him.
Where do you want to move?

584
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:35,124
LAURA: Oh my dear lord! I'm going to run around
behind the throne but I'm going to shoot him as

585
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:40,218
I'm doing it. I'm going to shoot him from there
and then I'm going to keep going. But I'm going to

586
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:43,417
shoot him with-- hopefully, the lightning actually
does something, because I'm going to shoot him

587
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:50,427
with the Lightning Arrow. And I'm doing it at a
fourth level.

588
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:52,004
MATT: All right.

589
00:40:52,004 --> 00:41:12,628
LAURA: So I roll. Attack as normal. Okay. Oh no!
Shit, what is that? 22? 22.

590
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:16,655
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
So it's normally 4d8, but you did it at a higher

591
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:19,194
level, so it's 5d8 points of lightning damage.

592
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:26,275
MARISHA: Wait, why was it higher? Did you do it at
a higher level?

593
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,471
LAURA: Yeah.

594
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:29,336
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

595
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:33,399
LAURA: 19.

596
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:40,482
MATT: 19 points of lightning damage. The lightning
streaks into it as the arrow hits and the

597
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:45,432
lightning begins arcing through its armor. It
bursts outwards. Keyleth, I need you to make a

598
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:47,919
dexterity saving throw.

599
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,830
LAURA: Oh shit! Keyleth, I'm so sorry!

600
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,614
SAM: Why?

601
00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:55,110
MATT: Because she's within ten feet of the
creature.

602
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,038
MARISHA: No, it's fine. I'm good. Dexterity save?

603
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,826
LAURA: No, it's a fucking lightning arrow, I never
use it.

604
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:03,450
MARISHA: 11.

605
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:09,936
MATT: 11. You take nine points of lightning-- no,
it's 2d8. So you roll 2d8 damage.

606
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:14,112
MARISHA: Does my spell resistance armor help with
this? I've got advantage.

607
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:16,092
LAURA: Just eight little old points.

608
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:21,021
MARISHA: Does my advantage from spell resistance
on my armor help with this?

609
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,023
MATT: It is technically a spell--

610
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:24,883
MARISHA: So can I roll again?

611
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,670
MATT: Go ahead and roll again.

612
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,987
MARISHA: Oh, that's better! 21.

613
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:34,088
MATT: So yes, you take half damage. So take four
points of lightning damage.

614
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:36,066
LAURA: Yay! See, that's nothing!

615
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:38,446
MARISHA: Feels good.

616
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:39,616
LAURA: Now you feel alive.

617
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:40,987
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm awake.

618
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,058
LAURA: And I'm going to keep running and go behind
the throne.

619
00:42:43,058 --> 00:42:44,550
MATT: That's as far as you can get at 30 feet.

620
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,087
LAURA: I'm going to stay right there.

621
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:50,413
MATT: Unless you want to run past this way.
(counting) You can get over there.

622
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:51,638
LAURA: Okay. Sure.

623
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:54,477
MATT: Knowing you and your movement situation, you
would have probably taken the more direct route

624
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:56,066
because you were going to get hit regardless.

625
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,068
MARISHA: So lightning radiated off of him?

626
00:42:58,068 --> 00:42:59,382
MATT: Scanlan.

627
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:01,176
SAM: So it did not hurt him at all?

628
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:04,915
MATT: The lightning hurt him, it arced through him
and it seemed to react to the impact.

629
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,628
LAURA: He's metal. He's made of metal.

630
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:14,398
SAM: Okay, before I go, because I wasn't in the
room, did J'mon Sa Ord say this is a test?

631
00:43:14,398 --> 00:43:15,672
ALL: Yes.

632
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:16,926
SAM: Okay.

633
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:18,414
TRAVIS: He said, show me what you can do.

634
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:20,883
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Show me what you've got!

635
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:25,084
SAM: Okay, I'm out of range so he can't swipe me
as I walk away, right?

636
00:43:25,084 --> 00:43:28,716
MATT: As far as you know. It's a long blade.

637
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:30,425
SAM: Then I'll stay put.

638
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:35,046
MATT: You saw the blade slam down towards Vex and
it slammed a few inches away from you so you're

639
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,941
right on that maybe/maybe not edge.

640
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:47,576
SAM: Let's not risk that. So I'll Hand Cone up.
Otiluke's Resilient Sphere to trap the beast.

641
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:49,432
LAURA: Yes!

642
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,269
MARISHA: Go, Scanlan!

643
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:53,277
MATT: Let me pull this up real fast.

644
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:55,033
LAURA: Please let this work.

645
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,459
TALIESIN: No, it's a good plan.

646
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:00,368
LAURA: It's enough to heal up and get ready.

647
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:04,557
MATT: A creature of object size Large or smaller.
This is technically a Huge creature.

648
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,339
SAM: He's Huge, I thought you said he was 15
feet!

649
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,410
MATT: 15 feet tall. He himself is about 15 or
so--

650
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,173
SAM: (groans dramatically)

651
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:20,226
MATT: A Medium creature's about six to seven feet
average. A Large creature is about ten to 12.

652
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:22,900
SAM: I have perfectly huge balls.

653
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,426
TALIESIN: You have big balls, not Huge.

654
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:28,221
SAM: They're Large or smaller.

655
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:36,083
MATT: So as soon as you start casting the spell
you look at the size and think, this isn't going

656
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,731
to fit in one of my spheres.

657
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:44,105
SAM: Okay, so I ditch that. And because I saw
lightning work I'm going to-- well, then I'm going

658
00:44:44,105 --> 00:44:48,560
to have to move. Can I hit him now without hitting
Keyleth or do I have to move for that?

659
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,113
MATT: You can because he's wide enough you can go
that way.

660
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:54,036
SAM: I'll just Lightning Bolt, then. Level three
Lightning Bolt.

661
00:44:54,036 --> 00:45:05,107
MATT: All righty. With advantage on its save, that
is a 16 dexterity saving throw.

662
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:06,676
SAM: It's a saving throw?

663
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:08,929
MATT: Yeah, against your Lightning Bolt, to see if it
manages to dodge out of the way.

664
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:11,956
SAM: Does my Cutting Words affect that at all?

665
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:15,046
MATT: No, Cutting Words is to reduce the attack of
another creature.

666
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:20,906
SAM: No, but because I'm armed with Mythcarver,
when I use it, my target gets disadvantage on his

667
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:22,298
next saving throw.

668
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:26,562
MATT: Correct, its saving throw is still a 16,
your DC is way higher, it failed.

669
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:27,818
SAM: Oh, okay.

670
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:32,061
MATT: This is a big creature, it's not very
dexterous. It can't dodge quickly, it's like

671
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:35,838
(groaning), it's like a small moving tank.

672
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:37,155
SAM: So 8d6 then.

673
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:38,312
MATT: Correct.

674
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:45,671
SAM: 24.

675
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:51,478
MATT: 24 points of lightning damage. The bolt of
energy arcs out from your finger, passing Keyleth.

676
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:57,817
You shake from the nearby impact, your body still
a little numb from the previous electrical hit. It

677
00:45:57,817 --> 00:46:02,525
blasts the front as the arc from Vex's attack
begins to wear off, this time the energy coursing

678
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:07,074
through its entire body. You can see as it tries
to lift the blade up for another attack it almost

679
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:13,780
drops the blade from the impact, but it stays firm
and shrugs it off, but you can see the darkened

680
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,749
period across its body where the electric bolts
are beginning to take effect across its physical form.

681
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:23,356
SAM: Okay, I'll use that opportunity to back away
and hope it doesn't get me.

682
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:28,939
MATT: You back away, and you're out of range for
it to try to make a strike at you. You can keep

683
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:30,121
moving if you want.

684
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,560
SAM: Yeah, I'll go all the way to the wall.

685
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,958
MATT: All the way to the wall?

686
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:45,298
SAM: Yeah, but not the glass. God, who's coming up
next? I will inspire Grog, he hasn't happened yet, right?

687
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:46,712
LAURA: Yeah, Grog's coming up soon.

688
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:53,836
SAM: I will inspire him with a hastily written
limerick. Okay, ready?

689
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:58,507
Kevdak had these terrible knuckles.

690
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:01,576
They beat up on Grog while he chuckled.

691
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,770
But while Kevin laughed,

692
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,511
Grog sliced him in half

693
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:07,445
And said, "These are mine now, fuckles!"

694
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:11,920
(laughter)

695
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,090
MATT: Those are all words that you can kind of
understand! So you take your inspiration dice.

696
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,245
TRAVIS: Amazing!

697
00:47:16,245 --> 00:47:19,136
LAURA: I like how his name was Kevin halfway
through the limerick.

698
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,137
TRAVIS: Fuckles. Is that a d10 or a d12?

699
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:25,117
MATT: d10. So that's the end of your turn?

700
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:26,678
SAM: That is all I can do.

701
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,290
MATT: All right, Keyleth, you're up.

702
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,198
MARISHA: Okay, seeing that the lightning is doing
some damage, I am going to cast Call Lightning at

703
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:34,432
fourth level.

704
00:47:34,432 --> 00:47:36,086
MATT: Okay.

705
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:42,658
MARISHA: I'm going to take a step back first,
actually.

706
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:44,542
LAURA: He'll get a swipe at you.

707
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,113
LIAM: There's a five foot square.

708
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,944
LAURA: Yeah, this is true, but at disadvantage he
still got me at 25 before.

709
00:47:50,944 --> 00:47:52,284
LIAM: Yes, but you're ten feet away though.

710
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:54,418
MARISHA: Just five feet, I want to shift back five
feet.

711
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:55,579
MATT: Okay.

712
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,354
MARISHA: I can do that without getting a swipe,
right?

713
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:59,542
MATT: He's already used his reaction to strike.

714
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:06,669
MARISHA: Aw, sick! I'll back it up a little bit
more, there's good, no right there's fine, yeah.

715
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:10,749
And I'm going to cast Call Lightning, fourth
level.

716
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:17,452
MATT: All right, the very top-- and this chamber
comes to this large, dome-like precipice at about

717
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:24,892
60 feet up-- upwards you see a skylight series of
glass begins to fill with dark clouds, swirling.

718
00:48:24,892 --> 00:48:31,604
As Keyleth's concentrating, her eyes fog over
white. What are you going to do?

719
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,431
MARISHA: Right on his head!

720
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:39,136
MATT: As Keyleth focuses, she brings her arm down
and one singular bolt coalesces, strikes down

721
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:41,545
right onto his head. What's the DC on the spell?

722
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,289
MARISHA: 19.

723
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:56,195
MATT: All right. Nope. He rolled a 19 and failed.
He's got a minus one on his dex save. He's a slow

724
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:59,461
guy. So he takes 3d10 lightning damage. Go ahead
and roll that.

725
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:01,044
MARISHA: 4d10 because I cast it at fourth level.

726
00:49:01,044 --> 00:49:02,795
MATT: That's right, 4d10, because it's fourth
level.

727
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:06,991
SAM: He's got 500 hit points.

728
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:08,500
LAURA: He's got so many.

729
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:19,521
MARISHA: Three, six, not great. Eight, so make
that-- what's six plus eight? 14 plus five, 19

730
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:20,953
points of lightning damage.

731
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:25,768
MATT: 19 points of lightning damage strikes into
its head, and you see it has to fall back onto its

732
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:32,365
back leg to right itself, and its growling sounds
like creaking of metal and stone against each

733
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,253
other.

734
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:38,035
MARISHA: And with that, I'm going to use my free
action to go earth elemental form.

735
00:49:38,035 --> 00:49:39,843
MATT: Bonus action, you mean?

736
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:40,958
MARISHA: Yes.

737
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,974
TRAVIS: "My free action!"

738
00:49:42,974 --> 00:49:50,368
LAURA: Is that what you said? "My free action!
Yeah!"

739
00:49:50,368 --> 00:49:53,210
MARISHA: Did I sound like Mickey? Did that
happen?

740
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,315
LIAM: (Mickey Mouse voice) I'd like to use my
bonus action to go earth elemental!

741
00:49:56,315 --> 00:50:02,777
MATT: As the growling sound of stone and metal
seems to vibrate the floor, you step back and hulk

742
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:07,310
out into your elemental form, almost returning a
similar earth-against-stone growl back at it.

743
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,626
LIAM: There she is.

744
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:10,623
MATT: Top of the round. Vax, you're up.

745
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:16,287
LIAM: Would you allow me to use my bonus action to
go stealth and quietly run over using my hasted

746
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:20,094
speed to get over to my sister behind that stone
thingy in the middle of the room?

747
00:50:20,094 --> 00:50:21,711
MATT: You could certainly try.

748
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:22,917
LIAM: Yes, I'd like to try.

749
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:28,106
MATT: Four, five, six. one. Get behind there, go
ahead and roll a stealth check.

750
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:35,985
LIAM: Okay. I'll use my last Luck of the day,
though. Fine. 29.

751
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:38,594
MATT: Okay. Far as you know, it doesn't see.

752
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:44,287
LIAM: Okay. I'd like to curve around by my sister
and use sharpshooter to throw two daggers as hard

753
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:45,642
as I can at him.

754
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,401
LAURA: What? Why are you going to--

755
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:49,229
LIAM: That's what I want to do.

756
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:51,526
LAURA: No! He's going to aim at me!

757
00:50:51,526 --> 00:51:01,513
LIAM: First one is a 26. 25. And the second one
misses, it's a natural one. With sharpshooter. Oh

758
00:51:01,513 --> 00:51:03,923
no. 26, 21.

759
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:06,180
MATT: All right. These are with which blades?

760
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:12,461
LIAM: This is with dagger of venom and flame
tongue. So the flame missed, dagger hit. Excuse

761
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,054
me, venom hit.

762
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,193
MATT: Right, okay. So you throw. Go ahead and roll
damage for the dagger of venom.

763
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:18,463
LIAM: Is it a sneak attack?

764
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:22,320
MATT: He does not seem to see you, so yes, you are
rolling damage.

765
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:38,717
LIAM: All right. So it's plus ten because I used
sharpshooter. So one, seven plus ten is 17. That's

766
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:44,860
the 20, 23, 27, 32, 37, 40.

767
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:52,318
MATT: 40! Nice! 40 points of piercing damage as
this one dagger hits one of its front chest plates

768
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:59,525
and causes it to dislodge and hang to the side,
and it's hanging by some sort of interior bolted

769
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:04,773
circumstance. You can see a bunch of iron
mechanisms that are holding it together, some

770
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:09,316
almost clockwork, some appear to be arcane in
nature and are being held aloft by sparking

771
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:11,222
whitish-blue energy.

772
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:13,212
LIAM: Do I have five feet of movement left?

773
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:16,729
MATT: You have about 15 feet of movement.

774
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,957
LIAM: I'm going to slink right behind the thing so
I'm out of range.

775
00:52:18,957 --> 00:52:23,732
LAURA: Yeah, good! Good job, thanks. So you hit
him and he looks over and I'm standing there. It's

776
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:26,956
the best. That's the best move. Ever.

777
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,374
LIAM: I didn't hear any of that.

778
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:30,546
LAURA: I'm right behind you, you did hear it!

779
00:52:30,546 --> 00:52:33,949
LIAM: That was longer than six seconds.

780
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,628
MATT: End of Vax's turn. Percy, you're up.

781
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:44,670
TALIESIN: Okay. I can see the damage that this
thing has taken. Would it be possible to target

782
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:54,353
the wound? I'd be happy to burn a grit to target
the mechanisms and not the armor. Try and get a

783
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:56,090
chunk of metal in there?

784
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,017
MATT: Sure.

785
00:52:57,017 --> 00:53:00,729
TALIESIN: Okay. First thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take a couple steps to the right and try

786
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:04,063
and shove my elbow on that glass to see what it
feels like.

787
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:12,364
MATT: Okay. So you step by and it's a pretty thick
pane, about maybe an inch or so thick. It has very

788
00:53:12,364 --> 00:53:21,474
faint glass-cut carvings and designs into it.
Mainly geometric vines that curl on themselves.

789
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:25,120
It's a really pretty display for the brief moment
that you glance out the corner of your eye at it.

790
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,910
TALIESIN: I just wanted to see how strong it
felt.

791
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,203
MATT: Pretty strong.

792
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:29,625
TALIESIN: Okay. Like high-rise glass.

793
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:30,515
MATT: Yeah.

794
00:53:30,515 --> 00:53:33,478
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pull the rest of my
movement the opposite direction.

795
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,252
MARISHA: Yeah, don't stand in front of a window.

796
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:41,176
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't want to be in front of a
window. I'm going to pull out Bad News and I'm

797
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:49,327
going to take a targeted shot at these mechanisms
with the big gun. I obviously can't do a trick

798
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:55,034
shot because I'm shooting at a thing. Obviously.
That would not work.

799
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:59,008
MARISHA: Obviously. Obvs.

800
00:53:59,008 --> 00:54:07,641
TALIESIN: Spend a deadeye shot for it. And I'm
going to do a sharpshooter. And I'm burning grit.

801
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:21,004
Here we go. Didn't need that grit, but fuck it.
Nope, rolled 18 on both! So 25 to hit.

802
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:22,676
MATT: 25 hits.

803
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:31,695
TALIESIN: You can borrow the die. 25 hits. Oh boy,
this is fun. Come on, where am I? d12s. And a d6.

804
00:54:31,695 --> 00:54:44,114
That's a-- (high-pitched giggling) I'm a
pretty, pretty princess. 21, 31, 37. 37 points of

805
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,780
piercing damage and five points of necrotic.

806
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,056
MATT: Okay.

807
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:50,828
LIAM: You, sir, have the temperament of a Yalie.
(gun firing)

808
00:54:50,828 --> 00:54:56,940
MATT: As you fire Bad News you can see the smoke
and dark mist that fires at the front of its

809
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:03,070
barrel from the Hex, the heavy bullet goes into
the opening in the chest that was given by Grog

810
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:09,330
and you hear it bouncing around inside, seemingly
not really doing any damage to the interior of the

811
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,355
creature.

812
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:11,222
LAURA: Come on!

813
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:12,780
LIAM: Still well-aimed.

814
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,686
TALIESIN: I reload.

815
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,828
SAM: And shoot yourself in the face.

816
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:23,249
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I am Aquaman in this fight, I'm
well aware.

817
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:24,645
LIAM: Take that sword out, man.

818
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:26,810
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn another grit. Oh,
yeah, no, I am, but I'm trying to be helpful in

819
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,154
the moment.

820
00:55:28,154 --> 00:55:30,338
MATT: So you fire, reload, and for your--

821
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:37,134
TALIESIN: This is my third and final shot, I'm
going to take an arm shot, I'm going to try and

822
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:39,186
get it to drop its toy.

823
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:40,541
MATT: All righty.

824
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:54,322
TALIESIN: Finally, a-- Oh, yay, that's better.
(counting) Sorry, I can't count. 22.

825
00:55:54,322 --> 00:56:00,403
MATT: That hits. So the bullet ricochets off the
hand, doing no damage to it, but what's the DC on--

826
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:01,569
TALIESIN: No damage?

827
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:02,571
MATT: No damage.

828
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,236
TALIESIN: Normal damage.

829
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,939
MATT: No damage.

830
00:56:05,939 --> 00:56:07,100
TALIESIN: My bullets do no damage.

831
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,112
MATT: Your bullets do no damage.

832
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:09,126
TALIESIN: But you still get necrotic.

833
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:10,320
MATT: Yes, it does.

834
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,677
TALIESIN: One point of necrotic damage.

835
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:13,916
MATT: One point of necrotic damage.

836
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,614
(laughter)

837
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:16,890
MATT: What's the DC?

838
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,505
TALIESIN: The DC is 19.

839
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:21,401
MATT: A 19? Okay, that brings it to--

840
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:24,207
TALIESIN: It's a strength saving throw.

841
00:56:24,207 --> 00:56:28,821
MATT: Strength, okay, that is a 17.

842
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:33,608
TALIESIN: He drops it. I yell out, somebody get
that thing away from him!

843
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:38,912
MATT: As the bullet slams into its hands, its
fingers, against its own will, are pried open from

844
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:43,814
the blast, a little bit of poof of smoke off to
the side. And the giant blade, which is about, I'd

845
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:52,653
say, seven and a half feet long, clatters to the
ground. That thing probably weighs quite a bit.

846
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,510
TALIESIN: I put my gun away and I'm done.

847
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,468
MATT: Okay, that's the end of your turn. Grog,
you're up.

848
00:56:56,468 --> 00:57:05,056
TRAVIS: Can I run, using a mixture of horizontal
and diagonal movements, to run straight at Iron Giant?

849
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:15,214
MATT: Yeah. (counting) And you have two more
squares of movement you can do if you want.

850
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,504
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to get right up on him.

851
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,795
MATT: All right, you're right there.

852
00:57:17,795 --> 00:57:22,505
TRAVIS: Can I put myself on the opposite side of
him from the window?

853
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,068
MATT: Right there?

854
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:32,915
TRAVIS: I would like to, since I have two attacks,
I would like to try to shove him.

855
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:37,070
MARISHA: Yes. This is what I was going for, yeah.

856
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,697
LIAM: There's a 20 on the die.

857
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:43,251
TRAVIS: He's only one size larger than me, so--

858
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,961
MATT: He's two sizes larger.

859
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:55,391
TRAVIS: In an effort to show off our Vestiges of
Divergence, I'd like to retcon this and smash my

860
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:59,642
Knuckles together and use the Enlarge to grow to
incredible size.

861
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,720
LIAM: Do you see me, angel guy?

862
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,466
SAM: To ridiculous size!

863
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:09,839
MATT: As you rush forward, towards it, you slam
your gauntlets together. As you get towards it you

864
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,359
begin to swell in size, your strides getting
longer and longer. By the time you approach it,

865
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:20,953
you are right there. You are now one size category
larger.

866
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,649
TRAVIS: Mighty Joe Young, bitch.

867
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:24,798
LAURA: Push him out the window, Grog!

868
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:32,434
MATT: All righty, so you are attempting to make a
shove attack. Okay. You push it away from you.

869
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:37,886
TRAVIS: Yes, a strength check against either his
strength or dexterity, it's the target's choice.

870
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:39,786
TALIESIN: He also has disadvantage on strength
checks.

871
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:41,723
LAURA: So he's going to choose dexterity.

872
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:47,644
MATT: Nope, his dexterity is fucking awful. So you
go ahead and make an athletics check.

873
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:54,837
TRAVIS: Yes, which I get advantage on. 23.

874
00:58:54,837 --> 00:59:01,893
MATT: 23? With disadvantage it's 19.

875
00:59:01,893 --> 00:59:05,957
LAURA: Yes! How far can you throw him?

876
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:08,504
TRAVIS: Only five feet, or knock him prone.

877
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:10,302
LAURA: Knock him prone!

878
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:11,812
SAM: I don't know.

879
00:59:11,812 --> 00:59:13,032
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to knock him--

880
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:15,978
SAM: Yeah, I'm not there.

881
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:19,837
TRAVIS: I'd like to knock him prone.

882
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:23,401
TALIESIN: Live your dreams.

883
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:32,148
MATT: You rush forward, and leaning the axe to the
side, you get low as it attempts to grab out and

884
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:36,724
punch towards your head. Reach down and grab it
from behind the ankle and then lift up, throwing

885
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:42,546
its leg up over and it goes tumbling backwards,
crashing onto its back on the ground, its limbs

886
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:45,653
loosely flailing, trying to find some sort of
purchase on the floor.

887
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:46,712
TRAVIS: Amazing.

888
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:48,863
MATT: You still have another attack, if you want
to.

889
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,029
TRAVIS: Oh, I do?

890
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:50,961
MATT: Yeah.

891
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:53,722
TRAVIS: And because he's prone, does that give
me-- no, I don't know. Reckless. I hit him with

892
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:54,924
the axe!

893
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,397
MATT: Go for it.

894
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:59,692
TRAVS: Eight. Eight again. Fuck you!

895
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:01,173
SAM: You've got inspiration.

896
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:04,027
TRAVIS: But I don't need it.

897
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:05,176
SAM: Oh great.

898
01:00:05,176 --> 01:00:08,325
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck, what did I say.

899
01:00:08,325 --> 01:00:09,180
LIAM: 22.

900
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,835
TRAVIS: Thank you, 22.

901
01:00:10,835 --> 01:00:11,774
MATT: 22? Hits.

902
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:23,919
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir. My brain don't work so
good. 19 plus one point of necrotic damage for 20

903
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:24,864
total.

904
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:30,461
MATT: 20 points of damage as you bring the axe
down with both hands, whack! Right into the center

905
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:37,238
of its chest armored cavity. You can see the axe
fits about halfway, almost to the center of the

906
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:43,399
handle itself into the chest and you have to work
it back and forth to wedge it out of its metal

907
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:47,829
hide. The axe is back in your grasp, and you can
see a giant gash mark where it was left.

908
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:50,046
SAM: So it felt that?

909
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,097
MATT: Yeah.

910
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:53,584
TRAVIS: Yeah, you feel Grog.

911
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:57,512
TALIESIN: It's armored, it's got a heavy armor
on.

912
01:00:57,512 --> 01:00:59,093
MATT: So Grog, end of your turn?

913
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:02,286
TRAVIS: That ends my turn. You know Grog always
leaves his mark, player.

914
01:01:02,286 --> 01:01:05,886
MATT: Now the golem's turn. Ah, look at that, it
rolled a six. So it recharges its poison breath.

915
01:01:05,886 --> 01:01:09,274
TRAVIS: Don't say that so willy-nilly.

916
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:14,873
MATT: So it stands up in its space, using half its
movement.

917
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:17,839
TRAVIS: I hate how confidently he's saying that.

918
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,516
LAURA: Oh no.

919
01:01:19,516 --> 01:01:29,347
MATT: It's then going to pull back (deep breath).
The helmet opens up from underneath and you can

920
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:37,234
see that giant black vacuous space in the center
of its throat. It lets another torrent of it

921
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:38,486
forward.

922
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,764
LAURA: Yeah. Oh! Tell me I'm just out of reach!

923
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,115
MATT: Nope. You're in reach.

924
01:01:43,115 --> 01:01:44,411
LAURA: Fucking shitballs.

925
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:48,330
MATT: I need Keyleth, Grog, and Vex to make
constitution saving throws.

926
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,699
LAURA: (singing) It doesn't matter, even with a
save I'm going to die.

927
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,656
MARISHA: I am immune to poison.

928
01:01:53,656 --> 01:01:54,859
MATT: You're immune to poison?

929
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,706
MARISHA: Because I'm a big earth elemental.

930
01:01:56,706 --> 01:01:58,378
TRAVIS: I have resistance to poison.

931
01:01:58,378 --> 01:02:00,659
MATT: All right. So what's your constitution
saving throw, Grog?

932
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:02,919
TRAVIS: It is an 18.

933
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,786
MATT: 18. All right. That fails, unfortunately,
but you still take half damage.

934
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:10,080
TRAVIS: Because of the belt of dwarvenkind.

935
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:17,774
MATT: Indeed. So with a full roll there. All
right. Grog, you take 25 points of poison damage.

936
01:02:17,774 --> 01:02:19,093
TRAVIS: Okay.

937
01:02:19,093 --> 01:02:21,901
MATT: Keyleth, you take none because of your earth
elemental form.

938
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:22,985
MARISHA: That's right!

939
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:24,896
MATT: You take 50 points of poison damage.

940
01:02:24,896 --> 01:02:27,276
LAURA: Awesome. I'm unconscious.

941
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,054
SAM: Did you say 50?

942
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:42,313
LAURA: Yeah. I'm straight up on the ground. I feel
like Matt, he wants me to die. He makes me

943
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:44,082
unconscious in every fight now.

944
01:02:44,082 --> 01:02:45,273
LIAM: Who, that golem?

945
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:46,475
LAURA: No, Matt.

946
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:47,695
MATT: You were there!

947
01:02:47,695 --> 01:02:49,802
LAURA: Nope. Matt wants me to die, I can feel it.

948
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:54,069
TALIESIN: To be fair, we have this really great
idea of what to do with Trinket once you're--

949
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:57,167
TRAVIS: Okay, let's not! Okay? Let's not!

950
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,927
MATT: To be fair, you've spent 90% of the game
flying way away from everything you've ever

951
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:07,409
fought, so maybe it's about time it caught up to
you a little. All right. That ends the golem's

952
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,954
turn. Vex, I need you to make a death saving
throw.

953
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,648
MARISHA: Jesus fucking fuck.

954
01:03:12,648 --> 01:03:16,874
TRAVIS: Roll one of the good ones? Which one will
it be, of the 90?

955
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:21,327
TALIESIN: Which child will disappoint you today?

956
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:23,189
LAURA: Oh no, I failed it!

957
01:03:23,189 --> 01:03:26,019
MATT: So mark off one failed death saving throw.

958
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:29,196
LAURA: Oh shitballs. Oh no!

959
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:32,806
MATT: All right. Ends your turn. Scanlan, you're
up.

960
01:03:32,806 --> 01:03:35,633
SAM: I will heal Vex'ahlia.

961
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:37,935
LAURA: Oh Scanlan!

962
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:39,782
SAM: Am I 30 feet away or closer?

963
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:44,009
MATT: You are further away from her. You are
currently off to that side. You are 40 feet from her.

964
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:47,154
SAM: Well, then I will walk 11 feet closer.

965
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,908
MATT: Okay. There you go.

966
01:03:49,908 --> 01:04:02,141
SAM: And I will use Healing Word to heal her. I'll
sing to her (singing) Up, up and away on your

967
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:06,364
beautiful, your beautiful broom!

968
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:09,374
(laughter)

969
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:12,554
MATT: What level?

970
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:16,991
SAM: I mean, it's a bonus action so I can't go very
high with the level, can I?

971
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:20,642
MATT: You can go as high as you want on the bonus
action, whatever spell you cast as your main

972
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:22,490
action can't be higher than level two.

973
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,600
SAM: As my <i>main</i> action can't be level-- what?

974
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,440
MATT: One of the spells has to be level two, the
other can be any level it wants to. That's how it works.

975
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,514
LAURA: Oh.

976
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:36,319
SAM: Got it. Well, then I'll do this one at level
two, and I can do anything for my main action.

977
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,206
MATT: Correct.

978
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,319
SAM: Okay. Level two!

979
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,462
MATT: All right. So that's 2d4 plus six.

980
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:41,619
SAM: Do I roll? I roll.

981
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:42,785
MATT: You do.

982
01:04:42,785 --> 01:04:44,449
SAM: One, two--

983
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,825
TALIESIN: Eight.

984
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:47,820
SAM: That's it! Seven.

985
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,880
MATT: So you heal seven hit points, Vex.

986
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,627
LAURA: Yay!

987
01:04:51,627 --> 01:04:53,177
MATT: Did you roll seven?

988
01:04:53,177 --> 01:04:54,559
SAM: No, I rolled two.

989
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,581
TALIESIN: So it's eight.

990
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:57,115
MATT: Okay, then eight. You're at eight.

991
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:58,320
LAURA: Yay!

992
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,809
SAM: Six? I thought it was plus five? Well,
whatever.

993
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:01,143
MATT: Plus six now because your charisma went up
by one, buddy.

994
01:05:01,143 --> 01:05:02,588
SAM: Oh that's right! I got to mark that down!

995
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:09,121
MATT: Yes, you should. The soothing words of
Scanlan Shorthalt pull you from unconsciousness as

996
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:14,583
your eyes begin to focus downward. You're looking
out past the balcony and you can see bits of dust

997
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:19,113
being scattered across the ground and you hear the
heavy footfalls of your friends and the golem

998
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:21,782
behind you as suddenly you're like, Oh shit!

999
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,794
LAURA: And I cough out blood.

1000
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:29,427
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you still have 15 more
feet of movement. Or ten more feet, technically.

1001
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:31,254
SAM: I'm going to go back to right where I was.

1002
01:05:31,254 --> 01:05:33,158
MATT: You get close to it at least. Right there.

1003
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:39,429
SAM: And shit. Shitballs. Shit. Shitballs fucking
shit. I will use (singing) Bigby's Hand.

1004
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:46,139
MATT: Grog, did you add your 1d4 points of damage
for your enlarged state? In your attack?

1005
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:48,152
TRAVIS: No.

1006
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:51,475
MATT: Roll 1d4. Add that. When you're enlarged you
do an additional 1d4 with any weapon attacks

1007
01:05:51,475 --> 01:05:53,415
because the weapon got larger as well.

1008
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,309
TRAVIS: One.

1009
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:57,589
MATT: There you go. All right. So what are you
doing Scanlan?

1010
01:05:57,589 --> 01:06:03,775
SAM: Bigby's Hand is going to make a huge fist,
fly forward, and smash the window.

1011
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:05,040
MATT: Behind?

1012
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,118
SAM: Behind him.

1013
01:06:06,118 --> 01:06:07,871
MARISHA: Fuck yes. Yes!

1014
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:09,595
TALIESIN: That's what I'm talking about!

1015
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:12,335
MARISHA: Yeah. We're all on the same page. I'm so
proud of us you guys.

1016
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:17,397
MATT: Let's have Bigby's Hand make a melee spell
attack against the glass.

1017
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:23,872
SAM: Melee spell attack. Well, that's cocked. 12
plus what?

1018
01:06:23,872 --> 01:06:26,131
MATT: Plus your spell attack bonus.

1019
01:06:26,131 --> 01:06:27,587
SAM: Oh. 22.

1020
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:33,532
MATT: 22. Without an issue the fist appears behind
the golem, fists up, and is about to punch it in

1021
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:38,207
the back of the head when, last minute, it whirls
around and slams into the glass. Go ahead and roll

1022
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,634
4d8 points of damage.

1023
01:06:40,634 --> 01:06:53,483
SAM: 4d8. I only have 1d8. 13 plus eight. 21. No!
22. No! What is it?

1024
01:06:53,483 --> 01:06:57,771
TRAVIS: 21! Holy shit!

1025
01:06:57,771 --> 01:07:06,822
MATT: You had it right. The window shatters, comes
clattering down, and suddenly the wind begins to

1026
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:11,880
pick up into the room. At this high a point, all
the silks are now whirling around. The storm at

1027
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,405
the top that Keyleth is holding is starting to
meet the turbulence and the lightning bolts are

1028
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:22,324
beginning to course through it even heavier. Right
now it's pretty heavy winds coming through here

1029
01:07:22,324 --> 01:07:24,532
regardless, so a lot of you are having to keep--

1030
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:30,185
SAM: Can I use any action to take off my hat and
let my hair flow, Matthew Mercer style?

1031
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:35,624
MATT: Yeah. I'll give you that. Like a fantastic
1991 rock video.

1032
01:07:35,624 --> 01:07:37,141
LAURA: Yeah!

1033
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:40,670
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (singing) I don't want to
wait for our lives to be over.

1034
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,425
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

1035
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:52,291
MARISHA: Okay. Grog's sort of out of my way--

1036
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,877
TRAVIS: Just bring it.

1037
01:07:53,877 --> 01:08:00,931
MARISHA: I want to full on linebacker style go for
this guy, and we're going out the fucking window.

1038
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:02,684
TRAVIS: Yes!

1039
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:07,327
MARISHA: And I'm going to take him, tackling him
out the window.

1040
01:08:07,327 --> 01:08:09,331
MATT: Okay, so you're going to go ahead and do a
shove attack?

1041
01:08:09,331 --> 01:08:12,189
MARISHA: Yes, that is what I'm going to do.

1042
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:14,766
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics
check.

1043
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:17,115
TALIESIN: So much strength disadvantage.

1044
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:19,563
LIAM: Such hassle. Too much hassle.

1045
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:22,333
LAURA: Yes. Do it, giant earth.

1046
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,912
LIAM: Shove out window, fighting too much hassle.

1047
01:08:24,912 --> 01:08:27,734
SAM: You know, if we can't kill it we can all kill
ourselves out the window.

1048
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:29,198
LAURA: Exactly.

1049
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,933
MARISHA: What am I doing? I'm an earth elemental,
so is that just strength?

1050
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:35,584
MATT: Yeah, so add plus five to it.

1051
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:36,759
MARISHA: Ten.

1052
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:46,364
MATT: All right. 18. And with disadvantage that is
going to be 22. So as you rush forward and slam

1053
01:08:46,364 --> 01:08:51,263
into it, it puts its hand out and takes the blow,
and it screeches a couple inches, but it's still

1054
01:08:51,263 --> 01:08:55,334
too heavy for you to get it forward. You have two
slam attacks, as part of it?

1055
01:08:55,334 --> 01:08:56,464
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do it again?

1056
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:57,386
MATT: You can do it again if you want.

1057
01:08:57,386 --> 01:08:58,621
MARISHA: Yeah, let's try this again.

1058
01:08:58,621 --> 01:09:01,208
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and add
five.

1059
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:05,296
MARISHA: Come on, big money-- ugh! No. Just no.

1060
01:09:05,296 --> 01:09:06,571
MATT: What did you roll? What's the total.

1061
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:08,085
MARISHA: I rolled seven total.

1062
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:12,371
MATT: Yeah, he-- natural one.

1063
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:14,700
(cheering)

1064
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:19,059
MATT: He rolled a seven and then a one. So as you
pull back with your other fist and you slam it

1065
01:09:19,059 --> 01:09:25,262
square into the center of the one plate that's
still visible, you hit it, and using all your

1066
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:29,635
might, looking over at Grog to get a little
inspiration, you grin at him with this horrible

1067
01:09:29,635 --> 01:09:38,292
earthy smile as you watch as it scrapes across the
floor of the throne room being pushed back right

1068
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:45,004
there, five feet. All right. That ends your turn.

1069
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:46,224
MARISHA: Yeah.

1070
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,688
MATT: Vax, your turn.

1071
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:53,813
LIAM: I want to, like a hasted spider monkey,
scrabble along the floor really low and flank the

1072
01:09:53,813 --> 01:09:58,571
thing opposite Keyleth and stab it in any gears I
see.

1073
01:09:58,571 --> 01:09:59,994
MATT: All right.

1074
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:01,813
SAM: Sorry, Vax.

1075
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:02,913
LIAM: I've got wings!

1076
01:10:02,913 --> 01:10:04,130
SAM: Okay.

1077
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:14,683
LIAM: First attack is a 17. Second attack misses,
it's a natural one. Third attack is a natural one.

1078
01:10:14,683 --> 01:10:16,121
MATT: So 17?

1079
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:19,139
LIAM: Oh, it's advantage on all the attacks
because I'm flanking?

1080
01:10:19,139 --> 01:10:22,040
MATT: Because you are flanking, it is advantage on
the attacks, yes.

1081
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,094
LIAM: Advantage on all?

1082
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:23,959
MATT: Yes.

1083
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:25,830
LIAM: So the first one was a 17.

1084
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,026
TALIESIN: And now you have one more roll for the
second.

1085
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:32,619
LIAM: One more roll for the second is a 13. And
then the third attack--holy cow--is a 25.

1086
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:39,905
MATT: Okay, so the first two miss, the last one
hits. The blades are (screeching) streaking across

1087
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:41,576
it. Which dagger is this?

1088
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:54,216
LIAM: The last one is the Dagger of Venom. It is
three plus six is nine plus-- they're right there.

1089
01:10:54,216 --> 01:11:04,204
What did I say before? Nine plus six, 15, 18, 24,
25, 31, 37, 40 again.

1090
01:11:04,204 --> 01:11:10,500
MATT: 40 points of piercing damage. First two
blades strike and make no mark whatsoever on its

1091
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,484
hide. However, the second one does manage to pull
apart and open this slight piece where you see a

1092
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:21,440
number of its giant iron central torso pieces
emerging. You see a slight seam there where

1093
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,947
they've been welded together. You take that moment
to pull back your dagger of venom and slip it as

1094
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:31,208
hard as you can right into that groove. As it
does, it sinks right to the hilt and the creature

1095
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:34,133
flexes its back in pain. (groaning)

1096
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:38,093
LIAM: I'm going to guess I have a little bit of
movement left, and I don't care if he swings at

1097
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:42,749
me. I'm going to back into the corner between the
hole and the window that's still in one piece.

1098
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:43,803
MATT: There?

1099
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:45,256
LIAM: Yeah, all the way to the wall. Yep.

1100
01:11:45,256 --> 01:11:49,229
MATT: There you go. All right, as you back away,
it swings back with its fist as it hasn't been

1101
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:53,936
able to pick up its weapon yet. Its fist is still
a large rock-like battering ram.

1102
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:55,515
That is a natural 20.

1103
01:11:55,515 --> 01:11:59,960
LIAM: Is it disadvantage, though, from Percy?

1104
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,930
MATT: Not anymore, that only lasts for a round.

1105
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,389
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge.

1106
01:12:03,389 --> 01:12:25,258
MATT: Eight, five, eight on 3d8. So 21 plus nine.
30 points of bludgeoning damage,

1107
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,797
60 points of damage.

1108
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:27,801
LIAM: 60 points?!

1109
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:28,898
MATT: 60 points of damage.

1110
01:12:28,898 --> 01:12:29,846
LIAM: With Uncanny Dodge?

1111
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:34,967
MATT: With Uncanny Dodge reduces it to 30. Whack!
It backhands you. While you're running for the

1112
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:39,620
wall, your vision goes white from the impact. You
hear that high-pitched whine as your ears can't

1113
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:43,532
even deal with the ringing of the impact. You
stumble and find yourself stumbling towards the

1114
01:12:43,532 --> 01:12:48,706
broken glass where the wind's coming from and
catch yourself back into the side of the wall.

1115
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:53,436
(heavy breathing) Catch your breath there on the
side. That ends your turn. Percy, you're up.

1116
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:56,251
TALIESIN: I'm kind of useless.

1117
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:59,875
MARISHA: Don't say that!

1118
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:10,221
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something stupid here.
I'm going to take a few steps to my left so I have

1119
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:12,255
a good, clear shot at it towards the window.

1120
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,097
MATT: To your left here?

1121
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:22,909
TALIESIN: Yep. More. Yeah, there. That'll do. I'm
going to keep blowing through in the hope that I

1122
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:28,882
get a crit because then I regain a grit. I'm going
to pull out Bad News and start firing to see if I

1123
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,271
can throw it off its aim.

1124
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:31,441
MARISHA: Are you grit farming right now?

1125
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:32,466
TALIESIN: I'm grit farming.

1126
01:13:32,466 --> 01:13:33,548
MARISHA: You're totally grit farming.

1127
01:13:33,548 --> 01:13:34,707
TALIESIN: I'm fucking grit farming.

1128
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:38,842
MATT: You're grit farming-- okay, go for it. So
Bad News is reload, attack, reload.

1129
01:13:38,842 --> 01:13:40,365
TALIESIN: It's not Bad News, it's--

1130
01:13:40,365 --> 01:13:41,620
MATT: Oh, it's Retort you're pulling out.

1131
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,670
TALIESIN: Yeah, Retort, it's off-balance so I'm
trying to find a place where-- give it some

1132
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:47,749
momentum to fall.

1133
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:49,344
MATT: You have one more shot, a reload, then a
shot.

1134
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:50,746
TALIESIN: I have one more shot, a reload, and a
shot. Two shots.

1135
01:13:50,746 --> 01:13:52,077
MATT: Go for it.

1136
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:56,329
TALIESIN: I hit, so that I might as well just
roll--

1137
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:57,715
MATT: Just roll the necrotic damage.

1138
01:13:57,715 --> 01:13:59,047
TALIESIN: That's six points of necrotic damage.

1139
01:13:59,047 --> 01:14:00,373
MATT: Six points of necrotic damage? All righty.

1140
01:14:00,373 --> 01:14:06,157
TALIESIN: And again. 21? Oh, 20.

1141
01:14:06,157 --> 01:14:07,292
MATT: 20?

1142
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:11,860
TALIESIN: 20. Not natural 20. It misses?

1143
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,775
MATT: It misses. The bullet goes past the armor
and ends up hitting the side of the wall and

1144
01:14:15,775 --> 01:14:17,291
cracks some of the marble.

1145
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,243
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to grit farm at this
point.

1146
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:22,265
MATT: Staying where you are?

1147
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:27,249
TALIESIN: You know? It occurs to me that this
battle's going to be over soon.

1148
01:14:27,249 --> 01:14:30,978
SAM: That's wishful thinking!

1149
01:14:30,978 --> 01:14:33,782
LAURA: Why would you throw that out there?!

1150
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:36,570
TRAVIS: Great way to hear God laugh is to announce
your plans.

1151
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:37,659
TALIESIN: Point!

1152
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:39,362
MATT: Grog, your turn.

1153
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:44,412
TRAVIS: After seeing Vex fall and then Scanlan
lift her up and then Vax get slammed into the wall

1154
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:50,706
and Keyleth showing up in this very attractive
form, I would like to reckless attack, and for a

1155
01:14:50,706 --> 01:14:57,327
bonus action, go into a frenzied rage for a third
attack, and use all three to try and

1156
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:59,377
push him out the window.

1157
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:00,971
MARISHA: Yes!

1158
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:07,711
MATT: All righty! You go into your frenzied rage.
Go ahead and make three athletics checks. First one.

1159
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,312
TRAVIS: I have advantage.

1160
01:15:09,312 --> 01:15:10,319
LIAM: Get it son!

1161
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,610
TRAVIS: That's a 23.

1162
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:22,713
MATT: That is an 18. So the first one, you slam.
Pushes it back. It's now teetering on the edge.

1163
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:28,952
Right there. Now, as part of the shove, my
question, I have to see if you get to move into

1164
01:15:28,952 --> 01:15:32,948
its space afterward because, right now, it's out
of your range.

1165
01:15:32,948 --> 01:15:35,770
TRAVIS: That is a good question. I could move.

1166
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:39,680
MATT: You'd have to move to that point to hit it.
Because you'd have to move five feet because

1167
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:46,294
Keyleth pushed it away. You shove it back.
Double-check this one more time.

1168
01:15:46,294 --> 01:15:47,977
MARISHA and LAURA: This. Is.

1169
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,450
MARISHA: Ank'Harel!

1170
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:56,476
SAM: Do we notice any rocket boosters on its
heels?

1171
01:15:56,476 --> 01:16:01,991
MATT: You have plenty of movement. You push it
back, you move in to get within range there. Go

1172
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,724
ahead and make another.

1173
01:16:03,724 --> 01:16:08,505
TRAVIS: 27.

1174
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:11,876
MATT: 27, that is a 17.

1175
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:13,136
LAURA: Yes!

1176
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:21,370
MATT: Pushed back, it's right up to the edge now,
its shoulders dropped against the edge. Its blade

1177
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,327
is still on the ground. Do you move in and go for
a final one?

1178
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:24,351
TRAVIS: Yes, please.

1179
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:27,784
MATT: Make an athletics check one more time.

1180
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:29,794
MARISHA: Come on!

1181
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,865
TRAVIS: That's good! 26.

1182
01:16:31,943 --> 01:16:33,230
MATT: Natural one.

1183
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,744
(yelling)

1184
01:16:35,744 --> 01:16:38,288
MATT: 15 and a natural one. All right, so.

1185
01:16:38,288 --> 01:16:41,558
How do you want to do this?

1186
01:16:41,558 --> 01:16:44,238
(cheering)

1187
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:50,305
TRAVIS: Because I love 300, I look at him and I
say, (yelling) This. Is. Vox Machina! And kick him

1188
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,385
in the chest out the window.

1189
01:16:52,385 --> 01:16:58,690
MATT: As your swollen, giant goliath foot slams
into the front, you see the metal plate that's

1190
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:03,825
dangling and the one that's still there cave
inward, sparks fly as the inner workings of it are

1191
01:17:03,825 --> 01:17:09,006
jammed with its own armored plate. Its arms reach
out and scrape and break off the sides of the

1192
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:16,227
walls as it falls backward and tumbles out of
sight. You glance over and look down as you watch

1193
01:17:16,227 --> 01:17:17,337
it plummet.

1194
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:19,333
TRAVIS: We're so high up.

1195
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,992
LAURA: So high.

1196
01:17:20,992 --> 01:17:22,390
LIAM: Empire State Building.

1197
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:26,199
MATT: (loud crash) Through the roof of some
portion of the Cerulean Palace.

1198
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:27,243
LAURA: No!

1199
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,338
MARISHA: Sorry!

1200
01:17:28,338 --> 01:17:29,361
TRAVIS: Fore!

1201
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:31,635
LAURA: I hope everyone's okay!

1202
01:17:31,635 --> 01:17:33,283
MARISHA: Sorry, Steve!

1203
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:39,301
TRAVIS: Do I have any movement to move away from
the opening of the window, just in case any

1204
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:40,420
trickery happens?

1205
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,488
MATT: Yes.

1206
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:43,455
MARISHA: I'm okay!

1207
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:50,973
LAURA: Can I stand up? I've been watching this
whole thing from the ground going: Yay Grog!

1208
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:52,369
SAM: Covered in blood.

1209
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:56,029
MATT: You stand up and look over the side just as
Grog kicks it out the window and it disappears out

1210
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:56,951
of sight.

1211
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:59,625
TRAVIS: I find earth elemental Keyleth. (heavy
hand slap)

1212
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:01,387
SAM: Don't leave me hanging, says Bigby's Hand!

1213
01:18:01,387 --> 01:18:07,633
TRAVIS: Yeah! Whack! It's like a jive hand shake,
it's like, yeah! Get a little weasel.

1214
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:13,178
LIAM: I'm going to skitter over to my sister and
help her up Saving Private Ryan style.

1215
01:18:13,178 --> 01:18:15,447
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself
there.

1216
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:16,653
MATT: Go for it.

1217
01:18:16,653 --> 01:18:18,364
LAURA: At 3rd-level there.

1218
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:22,288
MARISHA: Hey Grog! Chest bump! Huh! Yeah!

1219
01:18:22,288 --> 01:18:24,045
MATT: Both of you guys make athletics checks.

1220
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:24,874
TRAVIS: Yes!

1221
01:18:24,874 --> 01:18:25,717
MARISHA: Who?

1222
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:26,952
MATT: Both of you guys make athletics checks.

1223
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,059
MARISHA: For chest bumping each other?

1224
01:18:28,059 --> 01:18:29,127
MATT: Yeah.

1225
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:30,229
TRAVIS: 23.

1226
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:33,317
MARISHA: 19.

1227
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:37,652
MATT: (impact) You end up shoving her earth
elemental form back about five feet.

1228
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:39,265
MARISHA: Out the window?

1229
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:40,962
MATT: Not out the window, you're not close
enough.

1230
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:43,518
TALIESIN: Just double checking: can I feel if my
Hex has dissipated?

1231
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,289
MATT: Your Hex has dissipated, yes.

1232
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:46,516
TALIESIN: Just checking.

1233
01:18:46,516 --> 01:18:52,704
SAM: Are there shards of glass on the ground? Or
did they all go outward?

1234
01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:55,930
MATT: There are a few shards, but a lot of it
seems to be broken.

1235
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:59,915
SAM: Can I have Bigby pick up one and bring it
back? A tiny piece.

1236
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:03,337
TALIESIN: Do you have a mending spell of any
kind?

1237
01:19:03,337 --> 01:19:05,779
SAM: No. You're on your own, fuckface.

1238
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:10,731
TALIESIN: I'm not fixing it, I just thought it
might be nice, good god!

1239
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:15,792
MATT: How many hit points do you heal, Vex?

1240
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,372
LAURA: I'm at 28 hit points now.

1241
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:20,857
MATT: 28 hit points. All righty.

1242
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:25,830
LAURA: Oh no, what are you going to do now?!

1243
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:35,623
MATT: You guys take a moment to yourself to look
around and see if there's no other threat. With

1244
01:19:35,623 --> 01:19:39,238
the shattered glass window, the wind whipping
through the room, the silks all swirling,

1245
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:54,080
entangling around you. The wind slowly dies down,
suddenly and unnaturally so. You glance over the

1246
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,821
balcony, and what was once empty, you see a dark
figure standing, silhouetted by the outside

1247
01:19:57,821 --> 01:20:06,204
sunlight. Tall, thin, lithe figure. This appears
to be J'mon Sa Ord reappearing, who walks inside,

1248
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:16,103
hands together and an expression of amusement,
says, "Impressive indeed. Very well. You will have

1249
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:23,366
"my alliance and allegiance for the coming storm."
The door behind you, where you guys entered up

1250
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:31,987
inside opens and you see the Grand Maven step out
with a smile on her face as well. She looks over

1251
01:20:31,987 --> 01:20:41,417
to the window and goes, "Perhaps I should go check
on-- I should go check." She backs back in and you

1252
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:53,377
hear the chain rupture as it begins to shift back
down. J'mon steps forward. "Join me by the throne,

1253
01:20:53,377 --> 01:21:09,764
"please." Steps over and sits down once again. "The
cruel red that you speak of, that we once fought,

1254
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:18,605
"was crushed by our might and my hatred for its
kind. This city has many wards, as I mentioned,

1255
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:29,313
"and I am its protector. I have my ways, which I
utilize only when necessary. Now what you ask,

1256
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:40,335
"what you do, is already a deed of justice in and
of itself. I require no recompense beyond that.

1257
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:48,487
"While I cannot leave my city unguarded for long, I
must remain until you are prepared to engage this

1258
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:58,473
"Thordak head on. When the time comes, call to me
and I will come to your aid." And they raise

1259
01:21:58,473 --> 01:22:06,794
their finger and does a small snapping motion. You
watch as the throne itself lifts up and shifts off

1260
01:22:06,794 --> 01:22:14,583
of its place. A chest beneath it opens suddenly,
and the wind whips up once more throughout the

1261
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:20,306
room and as it does, a small, thin, extended
rod-like object floats and is tossed in the air by

1262
01:22:20,306 --> 01:22:25,728
the wind over in the direction of J'mon Sa Ord who
then snatches it and the wind ceases once more.

1263
01:22:25,728 --> 01:22:29,367
Presents it toward--

1264
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:32,144
SAM: I'll take that, please.

1265
01:22:32,144 --> 01:22:39,849
MATT: You take it. Looking at it, it's a small
brass flute. Looks simple. Like a penny whistle,

1266
01:22:39,849 --> 01:22:50,672
almost. As you're about to blow on it, J'mon puts
their hand up and says, "It knows the melody to

1267
01:22:50,672 --> 01:22:53,586
"call Devo'ssa but once."

1268
01:22:53,586 --> 01:22:55,199
SAM: To call who?

1269
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,515
MATT: "Devo'ssa."

1270
01:22:56,515 --> 01:22:59,819
SAM: Is that a name that you go by?

1271
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:10,386
MATT: "Devo'ssa is the guardian of this city."
J'mon stands back and slowly extends their arms as

1272
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:15,516
a sudden burst of wind once again fills the room,
swirling around, sending the silks tangling about

1273
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:21,301
once more, seeming stronger than what was brought
in from the shattered window earlier. Your hair is

1274
01:23:21,301 --> 01:23:27,487
being tossed and you watch as the lithe creature
steps back, the shape bending and swelling behind

1275
01:23:27,487 --> 01:23:33,115
the silks passing in front as it backs up toward
the opposite side of the chamber on the outside of

1276
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:40,518
the balcony. You watch the flashing of color, of
green and dark gold. A shadow takes the floors,

1277
01:23:40,518 --> 01:23:49,872
the new form before you holds most of the room,
lording over the throne (heavy footsteps). Wings

1278
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:55,022
(whooshing noise) unfurl as you see before you the
form of the city's protector: a massive brass

1279
01:23:55,022 --> 01:24:02,019
dragon, scales glistening in the window-fractured
sunlight, wings and tail tip becoming a gradient

1280
01:24:02,019 --> 01:24:12,325
into green at the end. Incredible, frightening,
beautiful. The dragon's head curls down, over

1281
01:24:12,325 --> 01:24:18,606
where the throne was moved, their head massive by
comparison to you and reminiscent of most of your

1282
01:24:18,606 --> 01:24:25,769
recent dragon fights, though there is almost a
smile and benevolence to their presence. The same

1283
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:34,080
black eyes, with a smoldering molten pupil still
stand there, staring back at you. "I share with

1284
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:44,322
"you my secret. There is now trust between you and
I. Do not forsake it."

1285
01:24:44,322 --> 01:24:45,883
LAURA: Never.

1286
01:24:45,883 --> 01:24:49,146
TALIESIN: This is a greater gift than we could
have hoped for.

1287
01:24:49,146 --> 01:24:57,250
MATT: (heavy footsteps) They sit back into a more
casual position, their claws still there before

1288
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:02,919
them, head still level with the rest of your
party. It slowly drifts back up, now looming down

1289
01:25:02,919 --> 01:25:14,006
over 30 feet ahead of you. The voice booms out
once more, "I will prepare here how I can. Now go.

1290
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:17,079
"Time is ever fleeting."

1291
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:23,703
LAURA: When we call your guardian, is that how
you'll know that we're calling you as well?

1292
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:27,436
MATT: "I am the guardian."

1293
01:25:27,436 --> 01:25:29,078
LAURA: I get it. I'm really smart.

1294
01:25:29,078 --> 01:25:31,675
SAM: She lost a lot of blood.

1295
01:25:31,675 --> 01:25:40,471
LAURA: (coughs) Also, like a big giant gash right
here. I'm going to hold it together. For now.

1296
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:51,126
SAM: Ahem. Excuse me. Your imminence-- imminence?
Eminence. As we are strangers in this foreign

1297
01:25:51,126 --> 01:26:03,504
land, we were also wondering if you would lend us
some sort of a calling card, something that proves

1298
01:26:03,504 --> 01:26:12,276
that we are friends of the state, it might serve
us well as we are automatically suspicious as we

1299
01:26:12,276 --> 01:26:14,356
walk around your great city.

1300
01:26:14,356 --> 01:26:18,507
TRAVIS: I wave my giant hand that I've enlarged.

1301
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:23,021
SAM: Or no. Either way, we're good.

1302
01:26:23,021 --> 01:26:26,853
TALIESIN: I get the feeling that perhaps, even
such a thing would make us even more of a target,

1303
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:28,235
perhaps?

1304
01:26:28,235 --> 01:26:32,771
MATT: The dragon leans forward, the head coming
down straight to you. Their maw right across from

1305
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:42,005
your size, one of their front teeth is about up to
your waist by comparison. (heavy breathing)

1306
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:51,004
(chuckles) "You are sly, gnome." Turns around and
reaches into the same box that carried

1307
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:57,404
the flute, pulls out a chain that dangles,
fluttering in the wind, and hands it to you.

1308
01:26:57,404 --> 01:26:59,104
MARISHA: It's a four-day Comic-Con badge.

1309
01:26:59,104 --> 01:27:03,500
SAM: Oh! Professional!

1310
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,720
MATT: "Only one day."

1311
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,819
SAM: Sunday? Motherfucker!

1312
01:27:10,819 --> 01:27:16,416
(laughter)

1313
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:22,030
MATT: The chain, as you grasp it-- it's dropped
into your hand and you look at it. There appears

1314
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:29,084
to be a brass emblem with a single circular
sapphire set into it. "This is a symbol of my

1315
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:36,567
"crest. Few should argue should they be under my
sway."

1316
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:46,387
SAM: Thank you so much. And I drop six inches,
which is to my knee, and bow my head in

1317
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:48,002
supplication.

1318
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:53,947
TRAVIS: Scanlan! Beep-beep. <i>Beep-beep!</i>

1319
01:27:53,947 --> 01:27:55,527
LAURA: He means "be pleased."

1320
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:57,045
SAM: Oh! Be pleased.

1321
01:27:57,045 --> 01:28:07,297
TALIESIN: Before we depart, my lord, I would ask
perhaps some local knowledge. We have magical

1322
01:28:07,297 --> 01:28:15,685
items that we require wisdom as to their origin
and their function. Who would you trust in this

1323
01:28:15,685 --> 01:28:17,955
city? Would you know who to trust in this city?

1324
01:28:17,955 --> 01:28:24,307
MATT: Thinks for a second.

1325
01:28:24,307 --> 01:28:26,791
TALIESIN: Flips through his notes.

1326
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,104
MATT: (chuckles) Yeah.

1327
01:28:28,104 --> 01:28:29,920
TALIESIN: A little Rolodex.

1328
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,158
LAURA: His Trapper Keeper. I like that everyone
has a Trapper Keeper.

1329
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:35,445
LIAM: Large brass Trapper Keeper.

1330
01:28:35,445 --> 01:28:37,530
TRAVIS: You hear the Velcro.

1331
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:40,782
TALIESIN: The iPad is rebooting.

1332
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:42,987
TRAVIS: Neon pinks and purples.

1333
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:45,298
MARISHA: Updating? Goddamn it.

1334
01:28:45,298 --> 01:28:47,746
LIAM: (as Devo'ssa) "I love Night Rider."

1335
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:52,547
SAM: How am I supposed to remember "beep-beep"
from two weeks ago?

1336
01:28:52,547 --> 01:29:03,616
MATT: "There are many who I would call friends, or
trustworthy. The list would be long."

1337
01:29:03,616 --> 01:29:10,556
TALIESIN: For ancient objects, such as we have.
For Vestiges. For things that are old.

1338
01:29:10,556 --> 01:29:14,580
MATT: "You would seek Headmaster James Kryon."

1339
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,635
MARISHA: James Kryon?

1340
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:17,739
LAURA: Krylon?

1341
01:29:17,739 --> 01:29:24,347
MATT: "Head of the Crystal Chateau's program for
arcane arts and training."

1342
01:29:24,347 --> 01:29:32,381
TALIESIN: I will not tell him of anything other
than our gentle acquaintance.

1343
01:29:32,381 --> 01:29:37,538
MARISHA: Crystal Chateau-- what was that last
bit?

1344
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,523
MATT: "The Crystal Chateau."

1345
01:29:39,523 --> 01:29:43,842
MARISHA: Got it. Sure. Crystal Chateau.

1346
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:45,738
LIAM and MARISHA: Old magic.

1347
01:29:45,738 --> 01:29:48,948
SAM: It's a two year professional degree.

1348
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:52,158
LAURA: I don't know how to spell chateau. I really
don't know how to spell it.

1349
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,163
TRAVIS: Percy, what's the proper way to leave a
royal chamber?

1350
01:29:56,163 --> 01:30:00,740
TALIESIN: The way that you leave a royal chamber
is you thank them for their patience and

1351
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:06,785
their time and for their wisdom, you keep your
head beneath theirs, and you never turn your back.

1352
01:30:06,785 --> 01:30:10,007
And you leave, facing them in reverence.

1353
01:30:10,007 --> 01:30:13,425
TRAVIS: Thank you for having patience, put your
head, and--

1354
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:17,281
TALIESIN: Be pleased. Don't say the words, just do
the things. I didn't tell you what to say, I told

1355
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:18,938
you what to do.

1356
01:30:18,938 --> 01:30:22,571
TRAVIS: Thank you for your patience. And I turn
around and walk out.

1357
01:30:22,571 --> 01:30:26,414
(laughter)

1358
01:30:26,414 --> 01:30:31,418
MATT: You hear a hearty, deep-throated chuckle as
you turn around. As you make your way to the door

1359
01:30:31,418 --> 01:30:37,396
of the exit, it opens once more as you hear the
platform coming to rest once again. As it opens,

1360
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:43,459
there standing in the space is the cobalt golem,
eyes flickering with white flame.

1361
01:30:43,459 --> 01:30:55,992
(footsteps) It comes rushing forward past you,
shouldering you out of the way. Grabs its blade.

1362
01:30:55,992 --> 01:31:02,197
You can see there are dents in its armor, but it's
still standing. Apparently didn't seem to take

1363
01:31:02,197 --> 01:31:07,927
that much damage from the impact of the fall. It
takes the blade and drags it behind it as it moves

1364
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:18,247
around J'mon, who steps back as the golem goes back
under the balcony and then begins to climb back up

1365
01:31:18,247 --> 01:31:22,248
outside to whatever strange device or platform it
was affixed to before it dropped.

1366
01:31:22,248 --> 01:31:23,449
LAURA: Sick.

1367
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:25,103
TALIESIN: Marvelous piece of engineering.

1368
01:31:25,103 --> 01:31:27,336
MATT: "We have many throughout the palace."

1369
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:36,069
TALIESIN: Your technology is impressive, your
craftsmanship beyond anything I have ever seen,

1370
01:31:36,069 --> 01:31:41,747
and there is nothing more pleasing than a monarch
with a sense of humor. Bless you.

1371
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:45,086
MATT: "My patience for your honeyed words grows
thin."

1372
01:31:45,086 --> 01:31:50,852
(laughter)

1373
01:31:50,852 --> 01:31:52,538
TALIESIN: Oh, that felt good.

1374
01:31:52,538 --> 01:31:54,144
TRAVIS: That was so good, too!

1375
01:31:54,144 --> 01:32:02,952
MATT: "Now, be on your way. I suspect when the
time comes to call me you'd best be ready. Now."

1376
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:09,263
Turns around and with a whirl, the wind picks up
again and the form shrinks down leaving, once

1377
01:32:09,263 --> 01:32:18,281
again, in the space as the shadow shrinks, the
lithe form of J'mon Sa Ord. They walk back to the

1378
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:23,036
throne as the throne seems to magically lift up
and cover the box that was there beneath it

1379
01:32:23,036 --> 01:32:29,593
before. Sits back on the throne, crosses their
knees onto the throne, leans on one side of the

1380
01:32:29,593 --> 01:32:30,989
armrest.

1381
01:32:30,989 --> 01:32:37,815
TRAVIS: Should we ask how to tell if someone else
is a dragon? Is there a tell?

1382
01:32:37,815 --> 01:32:39,718
TALIESIN: They won't tell you.

1383
01:32:39,718 --> 01:32:40,900
TRAVIS: Oh.

1384
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,552
TALIESIN: Because I think that's their secret.

1385
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:44,978
TRAVIS: Right.

1386
01:32:44,978 --> 01:32:47,677
LAURA and LIAM: Thank you.

1387
01:32:47,677 --> 01:32:49,066
TALIESIN: I begin walking out.

1388
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:50,258
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all walk out.

1389
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:53,531
LAURA: Backwards. I'm going to keep holding my
slashed--

1390
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:58,099
TALIESIN: That should actually give you excellent
posture for a slight bow.

1391
01:32:58,099 --> 01:32:59,597
LAURA: Right, yeah.

1392
01:32:59,597 --> 01:33:03,327
LIAM: I'm going to cast Lay on Hands through my
arm around her shoulder and give her a big five

1393
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,729
hit points.

1394
01:33:04,729 --> 01:33:07,894
LAURA: Oh, thank you. I'm in the thirties now.

1395
01:33:07,894 --> 01:33:10,512
TALIESIN: It's like the life force of two
kittens.

1396
01:33:10,512 --> 01:33:12,724
MARISHA: Two kittens worth.

1397
01:33:12,724 --> 01:33:18,410
MATT: You guys step back into the platform. The
door closes. The chains shudder and begin to

1398
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:24,031
unfurl as the platform lowers down once more,
giving you the view over the vast expanse of

1399
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,181
Ank'Harel and the deserts beyond.

1400
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:27,831
MARISHA: Oh, in the see-through elevator?

1401
01:33:27,831 --> 01:33:28,731
MATT: Yep.

1402
01:33:28,731 --> 01:33:29,786
TRAVIS: Just us, no Grand Maven?

1403
01:33:29,786 --> 01:33:34,703
MATT: No Grand Maven. It finally reaches the
bottom floor. The door opens once again, and there

1404
01:33:34,703 --> 01:33:39,767
you see the Grand Maven surrounded by twelve
different servants that are now picking up pieces

1405
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:46,159
of shattered rooftop, broken furniture, and a
large crater that is now jammed in the center of

1406
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:51,284
what was once the waiting room where you guys were
previously set. Furniture scattered and totally

1407
01:33:51,284 --> 01:33:58,835
ruined, and there seems to be an air of haste in
making sure that it doesn't stay like this for long.

1408
01:33:58,835 --> 01:34:01,331
LAURA: So sorry about that.

1409
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:03,033
SAM: Did anyone die?

1410
01:34:03,033 --> 01:34:08,540
MATT: "Thankfully, no. There was no death. You are
lucky this time."

1411
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:12,290
TALIESIN: Just a heart attack and a metaphor for
our entire existence, that's fine.

1412
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:18,175
SAM: Did you see a javelin? No? Maybe? Okay.

1413
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:19,543
LAURA: Can we look around for it?

1414
01:34:19,543 --> 01:34:23,536
TALIESIN: We're going to have to take a walk
around the tower for a javelin. You threw it?

1415
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:25,246
TRAVIS: How high is the top of the tower?

1416
01:34:25,246 --> 01:34:28,685
MATT: It's hard to tell. A few hundred feet.

1417
01:34:28,685 --> 01:34:32,472
TRAVIS: A few hundred feet up, I chucked the shit
out of it.

1418
01:34:32,472 --> 01:34:35,194
LAURA: It could be around.

1419
01:34:35,194 --> 01:34:37,461
TRAVIS: You know the needle in the desert
metaphor?

1420
01:34:37,461 --> 01:34:40,099
TALIESIN: Is there a needle in the desert-- is
that a thing?

1421
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:41,264
TRAVIS: Well, I've heard it before.

1422
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:42,659
MATT: There is now.

1423
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:46,745
TRAVIS: Many a wise and learned creature--

1424
01:34:46,745 --> 01:34:51,546
MATT: You wish to take some time to go ahead and
try and figure out a trajectory and where it may

1425
01:34:51,546 --> 01:34:52,559
have gone?

1426
01:34:52,559 --> 01:34:55,590
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down and do a little
math and see if I can get a vague sense.

1427
01:34:55,590 --> 01:35:01,746
LAURA: I'm going to ask the Grand Maven: Flying,
is that sort of weird here, or is that totally

1428
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:07,994
okay? On a broom, maybe? I don't want to do
anything that's wrong here. I feel like I might be

1429
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:10,254
able to see it.

1430
01:35:10,254 --> 01:35:16,204
MATT: "As far as I understand, there is no issue
with flying within Ank'Harel."

1431
01:35:16,204 --> 01:35:18,378
TALIESIN: Not old math.

1432
01:35:18,378 --> 01:35:22,831
MARISHA: New math. He's finding fractals and shit
over here.

1433
01:35:22,831 --> 01:35:25,156
MATT: Did you roll a natural 20?

1434
01:35:25,156 --> 01:35:27,932
TALIESIN: Weirdly enough, I've figured out--

1435
01:35:27,932 --> 01:35:29,858
MARISHA: He just created the Mandelbrots.

1436
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:34,274
LAURA: Percy, point me in the direction. I'll fly
and get it.

1437
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:35,673
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1438
01:35:35,673 --> 01:35:38,890
MATT: You became the animated gif of the cat that
gets the flower on its head and sees through space

1439
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:46,045
and time. You guys watch as Percy zones out for
five minutes, the hand moving at a rapid pace

1440
01:35:46,045 --> 01:35:47,177
across the paper.

1441
01:35:47,177 --> 01:35:49,281
TALIESIN: I found a window and I'm doing the
Beautiful Mind.

1442
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:57,282
MATT: What that enables you, as you get some ideas
as to the trajectory, the speed, the strength of

1443
01:35:57,282 --> 01:36:04,410
Grog in the non-grown form versus the grown form.
This does allow you, whoever wants to lead this

1444
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:08,887
expedition, one investigation check to possibly
even recover anything.

1445
01:36:08,887 --> 01:36:11,263
LAURA: Can I fly? I feel like I could fly down and
get it.

1446
01:36:11,263 --> 01:36:13,794
TALIESIN: I'll fly with her and use the math to--

1447
01:36:13,794 --> 01:36:15,204
LAURA: Point me in the direction.

1448
01:36:15,204 --> 01:36:20,209
MATT: So the two of you are using the broom. It only
has space on it for one.

1449
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:21,254
TALIESIN: I'm going to hang.

1450
01:36:21,254 --> 01:36:25,179
MATT: Okay, so Percy's hanging from underneath as
you fly up a few hundred feet.

1451
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,289
LAURA: Hold tight, Percy!

1452
01:36:27,289 --> 01:36:29,303
TALIESIN: I've locked my gauntlet.

1453
01:36:29,303 --> 01:36:33,289
LAURA: I'm holding onto one of his wrists as I'm
flying.

1454
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:35,313
LIAM: I'm watching in case I need to catch.

1455
01:36:35,313 --> 01:36:38,925
MATT: You guys watch them vanish in
a darker and darker spot as they get higher into

1456
01:36:38,925 --> 01:36:47,162
the sky. Percy. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw. You've not been this high before and the

1457
01:36:47,162 --> 01:36:53,028
sheer perspective and the fact that you have very
little affixing you to this broom, we're going to

1458
01:36:53,028 --> 01:36:57,634
see if you can overcome this singular human fear
of heights.

1459
01:36:57,634 --> 01:36:59,633
LAURA: No, Percy, you're totally fine.

1460
01:36:59,633 --> 01:37:05,270
TALIESIN: No, I'm not. Oh, I can reroll a saving
throw, can't I? Yeah.

1461
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:07,130
MATT: You can, as a fighter, yeah.

1462
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,741
TALIESIN: I can reroll a saving throw, because I'm
going to pretend that number didn't happen.

1463
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:14,971
MATT: Indomitable Will, this is a perfect use for
it, actually.

1464
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:17,938
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it again. I have one
more, so I'm going to blow them all.

1465
01:37:17,938 --> 01:37:19,499
MATT: Okay, I'll let you do that.

1466
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:20,447
TALIESIN: Better!

1467
01:37:20,447 --> 01:37:22,010
MARISHA: Fight that vertigo, fight it!

1468
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:26,300
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what, because I had to blow
all of those, we can say I threw up a little.

1469
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:31,905
Let's go there. That's a wisdom, that's 19.

1470
01:37:31,905 --> 01:37:38,107
MATT: 19. You feel quivering of the broom as
Percy's hands are beginning to shake and you see

1471
01:37:38,107 --> 01:37:43,831
the fingers constantly flutter. As you look down,
about to ask if he's okay, you watch as

1472
01:37:43,831 --> 01:37:45,880
(vomit noise) this spray of--

1473
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,059
LAURA: I throw up, too, because anytime I--

1474
01:37:49,059 --> 01:37:50,719
TALIESIN: This was a very poor decision!

1475
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,424
MATT: Vax, you watch as you see a gentle rain.

1476
01:37:54,424 --> 01:37:55,997
TALIESIN: Have we gone forward, or have we just
gone straight up?

1477
01:37:55,997 --> 01:37:57,297
MATT: Gone straight up in an arc.

1478
01:37:57,297 --> 01:37:58,784
TALIESIN: So we're not going to hit them.

1479
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:09,548
LIAM: Excuse me, but this is poetic justice if I
have ever seen it. That is beautiful.

1480
01:38:09,548 --> 01:38:12,467
TALIESIN: This has been the metaphor game. This is
a metaphor for our entire existence.

1481
01:38:12,467 --> 01:38:16,105
MATT: Yeah, some poor folks in Ank'Harel right now
are having a really bad afternoon.

1482
01:38:16,105 --> 01:38:19,889
MARISHA: Yeah, I do a Gust cantrip overtop of us
to keep from getting splattered.

1483
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:22,105
LAURA: I'm going to keep my hand on your wrist,
Percy.

1484
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,693
TALIESIN: I'm not going to look down. I'm going to
look ahead. I'm good.

1485
01:38:24,693 --> 01:38:32,241
MATT: He directs you vaguely where it may have
landed. I need you to make a perception check.

1486
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:33,548
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1487
01:38:33,548 --> 01:38:35,083
LIAM: That's your jam.

1488
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:38,434
LAURA: I'm going to try this fancy little dice
here.

1489
01:38:38,434 --> 01:38:40,556
MATT: You're going to have to roll crazy high.

1490
01:38:40,556 --> 01:38:41,819
LIAM: Nope!

1491
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:43,499
MARISHA: Shut up!

1492
01:38:43,499 --> 01:38:45,239
TRAVIS: No, that's a seven, right?

1493
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:51,528
LAURA: This is a one. I'm going to blame it on
Matt Abernathy. Thanks for that opal dice.

1494
01:38:51,528 --> 01:38:53,739
MARISHA: Is it the opal dice again?!

1495
01:38:53,739 --> 01:38:54,640
LAURA: Yeah!

1496
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,840
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

1497
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,310
LAURA: He got opal dice and it-- okay. That's
okay.

1498
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:03,094
MATT: We love you, Abernathy, don't listen to
her.

1499
01:39:03,094 --> 01:39:04,639
LAURA: 13 perception.

1500
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,166
MATT: But you rolled a natural one.

1501
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:07,628
LIAM: Automatic failure. Sorry, Charlie.

1502
01:39:07,628 --> 01:39:08,784
LAURA: Damn it.

1503
01:39:08,784 --> 01:39:12,152
MATT: As he begins telling you about the wind
trajectory, and the direction of its travel and

1504
01:39:12,152 --> 01:39:18,001
the hypotenuse, and he goes in this long series of
various--

1505
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:23,299
LAURA: I zone in and I notice that I accidentally
puked a little bit on Percy's head. And that

1506
01:39:23,299 --> 01:39:24,767
completely distracts me.

1507
01:39:24,767 --> 01:39:27,879
MATT: Just focusing on the one bit of his hair.
The little clump right there.

1508
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:32,494
LAURA: That's got a tiny bit of puke on the top of
his head, and I feel so bad I can't focus on what

1509
01:39:32,494 --> 01:39:33,501
you're saying.

1510
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:37,256
TALIESIN: Because of that, we've done about 350.
Have we done 350? Where are we now, 80, 90 feet

1511
01:39:37,256 --> 01:39:38,944
ahead?

1512
01:39:38,944 --> 01:39:41,453
LAURA: And I throw up again because it's so gross
to see.

1513
01:39:41,453 --> 01:39:47,933
MATT: This time, thankfully, you have the mind to pull
out of the way a little bit. However, after about

1514
01:39:47,933 --> 01:39:51,876
ten minutes of conversation, and you unable to
focus again: it's lost. You have no idea where

1515
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:53,092
that javelin is.

1516
01:39:53,092 --> 01:39:55,858
LIAM: I would like to think you could feel my
grinning from way down below.

1517
01:39:55,858 --> 01:39:57,993
LAURA: You were so smart with your math and I--

1518
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:01,299
TALIESIN: No, sometimes math is not enough.

1519
01:40:01,299 --> 01:40:02,891
SAM: 20 and a one.

1520
01:40:02,891 --> 01:40:04,858
TALIESIN: Let's go fly down.

1521
01:40:04,858 --> 01:40:10,022
LAURA: Someone is going to find a really expensive
weapon.

1522
01:40:10,022 --> 01:40:13,683
MATT: Someone's going to find some pauper impaled
on a wall somewhere.

1523
01:40:13,683 --> 01:40:21,318
LAURA: Oh no! No, I hope not! And the mystery, it
will just be unsolved mysteries, they'll never know.

1524
01:40:21,318 --> 01:40:24,457
MATT: Three month investigation, no answers.

1525
01:40:24,457 --> 01:40:26,898
LAURA: They're going have a documentary on Making
a Murderer.

1526
01:40:26,898 --> 01:40:29,290
TRAVIS: It'll be one dude impaled against the wall
and some poor bastard that grabbed it and then got

1527
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:32,712
fucking electrocuted. There's two corpses.

1528
01:40:32,712 --> 01:40:37,875
MATT: As you guys fly back down, gather the rest
of your party, the javelin lost.

1529
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:39,677
LAURA: Sorry, Percy, I'm so sorry.

1530
01:40:39,677 --> 01:40:41,105
TALIESIN: It's all right. It wasn't my javelin.

1531
01:40:41,105 --> 01:40:43,414
LAURA: No, but it was your hair that I threw up
on.

1532
01:40:43,414 --> 01:40:44,508
TALIESIN: You threw up on my hair?!

1533
01:40:44,508 --> 01:40:45,967
LAURA: I mean! And I take some--

1534
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:48,633
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1535
01:40:48,633 --> 01:40:51,213
LAURA: You know, if you hadn't thrown up to begin
with, this would have never happened.

1536
01:40:51,213 --> 01:40:57,072
TALIESIN: I wasn't aware that was going to be a
thing that could happen. My hair is very

1537
01:40:57,072 --> 01:40:58,569
absorbent, that's going to take some time.

1538
01:40:58,569 --> 01:41:04,972
MATT: So as you guys take a moment to gather your
next stage in your endeavor for the day, we're

1539
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:09,524
going to take a quick bathroom break. Back here in
a few minutes guys; hold tight. We'll continue

1540
01:41:09,524 --> 01:41:11,256
this adventure here in just a moment.

1541
01:41:11,256 --> 01:41:12,860
LAURA: Man, I rolled a one!

1542
01:41:12,860 --> 01:54:07,352
[break]

1543
01:54:07,352 --> 01:54:13,082
MATT: Hello guys, welcome back! So, finished our
break, Vox Machina have exited the Cerulean

1544
01:54:13,082 --> 01:54:23,718
Palace. Apparently revealed to J'mon Sa Ord that
they were capable, and in doing so, J'mon Sa Ord

1545
01:54:23,718 --> 01:54:32,144
revealed that so is the leader of the city. So one
javelin down, unfortunately. You are now getting

1546
01:54:32,144 --> 01:54:34,897
to the later evening of your time here in
Ank'Harel.

1547
01:54:34,897 --> 01:54:36,010
LAURA: What time is it?

1548
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,041
MATT: What is your plan?

1549
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:39,207
SAM: Is it sundown yet?

1550
01:54:39,207 --> 01:54:42,325
MATT: It's pretty close. The sun's 
about 30 minutes from dusk.

1551
01:54:42,325 --> 01:54:43,400
LIAM: Is it spice o'clock?

1552
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,812
LAURA: I'm going to use another spell and heal
myself some more.

1553
01:54:46,812 --> 01:54:50,259
SAM: Oh yeah. Can we take a short rest somewhere?
And hit dice it up or something?

1554
01:54:50,259 --> 01:54:55,751
MATT: Yeah, totally. Go ahead and take a short
rest out there on the steps of the Cerulean Palace.

1555
01:54:55,751 --> 01:54:57,380
SAM: Take a knee.

1556
01:54:57,380 --> 01:55:03,471
MARISHA: A little therapeutic massages all the way
around.

1557
01:55:03,471 --> 01:55:07,777
TALIESIN: Is Grit recovery a short rest or a long
rest? I can't remember.

1558
01:55:07,777 --> 01:55:10,095
MATT: What do you mean?

1559
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:11,357
TALIESIN: Grit recovery.

1560
01:55:11,357 --> 01:55:12,360
MATT: It's a short rest.

1561
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,511
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1562
01:55:13,511 --> 01:55:16,871
MATT: And don't forget, Scanlan, you have an
ability that helps everyone who's using hit dice

1563
01:55:16,871 --> 01:55:18,081
gets a bonus.

1564
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:18,944
LAURA: You do?

1565
01:55:18,944 --> 01:55:19,702
MARISHA: Really?

1566
01:55:19,702 --> 01:55:21,244
SAM: It's not very much but yes! Yes, I do.

1567
01:55:21,244 --> 01:55:23,353
TALIESIN: It's even less if you don't do it.

1568
01:55:23,353 --> 01:55:27,263
SAM: I've never used it because it's so weak. But
yeah, sure.

1569
01:55:27,263 --> 01:55:28,409
TALIESIN: He doesn't like us.

1570
01:55:28,409 --> 01:55:31,339
SAM: Yeah. I do. I'm trying to find where--

1571
01:55:31,339 --> 01:55:35,913
MATT: Song of Rest.

1572
01:55:35,913 --> 01:55:39,244
SAM: Song of Rest. It's only a d10? What is it?

1573
01:55:39,244 --> 01:55:40,583
TALIESIN: Yeah. 1d10.

1574
01:55:40,583 --> 01:55:43,062
LAURA: That's still. That's potentially ten extra
hit points.

1575
01:55:43,062 --> 01:55:44,665
MARISHA: Between all of us.

1576
01:55:44,665 --> 01:55:48,443
MATT: Every person, as soon as you finish your
short rest to heal. You heal an additional 1d10

1577
01:55:48,443 --> 01:55:49,691
hit points at the end of it.

1578
01:55:49,691 --> 01:55:52,454
SAM: All right. I will sing us a Song of Rest.

1579
01:55:52,454 --> 01:55:57,323
MARISHA: Oh, I rolled a ten! Oh wait, do I roll or
you roll?

1580
01:55:57,323 --> 01:55:58,718
MATT: You roll.

1581
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:00,388
MARISHA: We roll? Cool!

1582
01:56:00,388 --> 01:56:10,517
SAM: I'll sing. (singing) I believe you can kill.
I believe that you really will. Think about it

1583
01:56:10,517 --> 01:56:18,362
every night and day. Sharpen your blades because
it's time to play. I believe!

1584
01:56:18,362 --> 01:56:19,962
Okay, it's time to go get some spice!

1585
01:56:19,962 --> 01:56:23,111
(laughter)

1586
01:56:23,111 --> 01:56:30,461
MATT: You finish your short rest. As the night
takes the sky, the streets of Ank'Harel do not

1587
01:56:30,461 --> 01:56:36,708
grow any calmer. The bazaar lights begin to glow
in the distance as you see the lanterns and

1588
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:47,549
various magical light sources of the city spark to
life and the lamps light themselves. But the city

1589
01:56:47,549 --> 01:56:53,111
still seems to be bustling with all the energy and
buzz of the day before. What would you like to do?

1590
01:56:53,111 --> 01:56:58,368
TALIESIN: There's a casino if I recall.

1591
01:56:58,368 --> 01:57:00,602
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's where we're going.

1592
01:57:00,602 --> 01:57:01,999
LIAM: Do you gamble?

1593
01:57:01,999 --> 01:57:04,784
TALIESIN: I don't know. I mean, I do, but I never
gamble for fun.

1594
01:57:04,784 --> 01:57:06,335
LIAM: I don't mean with lives.

1595
01:57:06,335 --> 01:57:07,841
TALIESIN: No, I do not gamble.

1596
01:57:07,841 --> 01:57:10,852
MARISHA: I enjoy the gambling game. That's fun!

1597
01:57:10,852 --> 01:57:14,015
TALISIN: That's right! We did play cards with you.
That went really well.

1598
01:57:14,015 --> 01:57:21,411
SAM: Guys. If we're going to this casino, I have
a deal to make. I value your friendship. I value

1599
01:57:21,411 --> 01:57:32,871
the backup you will provide, but I need you to
stay far away. Be inconspicuous. And by the gods,

1600
01:57:32,871 --> 01:57:38,592
<i>do not help me in any way!</i> Unless I say some
sort of a codeword.

1601
01:57:38,592 --> 01:57:40,073
LAURA: What's the codeword?

1602
01:57:40,073 --> 01:57:41,972
TALIESIN: Help me. Help me. Oh God, help me?

1603
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:50,595
SAM: That's a good one. Let's make it that! Help
me. Help me. Oh God, help me!

1604
01:57:50,595 --> 01:57:52,231
LAURA: I have a question.

1605
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:53,434
SAM: Yes?

1606
01:57:53,434 --> 01:57:59,395
LAURA: Do you really think this is a smart move,
considering that a brass dragon just gave us our

1607
01:57:59,395 --> 01:58:02,466
aid and asked us not to fuck anything up?

1608
01:58:02,466 --> 01:58:04,134
MARISHA: Also, what exactly are you doing?

1609
01:58:04,134 --> 01:58:07,719
TRAVIS: (loudly) Your drug deal?

1610
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:14,121
SAM: Keep it down, dude! Chill! Just chill!

1611
01:58:14,121 --> 01:58:18,684
LAURA: All right. We're cool, Scanlan. We're
cool.

1612
01:58:18,684 --> 01:58:20,017
SAM: We are not cool.

1613
01:58:20,017 --> 01:58:21,625
LAURA and MARISHA: We're so
cool.

1614
01:58:21,625 --> 01:58:22,957
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: So cool.

1615
01:58:22,957 --> 01:58:25,685
TALIESIN: I'm cool enough to know that, perhaps,
you should hand off that necklace that he gave you.

1616
01:58:25,685 --> 01:58:26,952
SAM: Not at all.

1617
01:58:26,952 --> 01:58:28,383
TALIESIN: They're going to think you're a narc.

1618
01:58:28,383 --> 01:58:31,918
LAURA: Oh, they <i>are!</i> What if they find it on
you?

1619
01:58:31,918 --> 01:58:33,576
TALIESIN: You're wearing a police badge
basically.

1620
01:58:33,576 --> 01:58:41,983
LAURA: Give it to us. If anyone comes and tries to
take you away, we'll present it and say that we're

1621
01:58:41,983 --> 01:58:44,237
higher rank.

1622
01:58:44,306 --> 01:58:45,411
MARISHA: That's true.

1623
01:58:45,411 --> 01:58:49,896
TRAVIS: Are you supposed to do anything to set up
for this deal?

1624
01:58:49,896 --> 01:58:53,631
SAM: Set up? I have to change into my red shirt.

1625
01:58:53,631 --> 01:58:59,682
LIAM: And also, are you sure you really don't want
us nearby? My sister and I can be unseen.

1626
01:58:59,682 --> 01:59:05,891
SAM: Nearby is fine. Nearby is fine but keep your
distance and do not do anything <i>including</i> if it

1627
01:59:05,891 --> 01:59:07,773
looks like I'm in trouble.

1628
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:09,751
LIAM: I mean I'm ready for the show, man. It's
fine.

1629
01:59:09,751 --> 01:59:15,545
LAURA: We've seen you turn into a triceratops
and fuck things up. We trust you, Scanlan.

1630
01:59:15,545 --> 01:59:17,467
LIAM: Oh, we didn't see that.

1631
01:59:17,467 --> 01:59:18,683
LAURA: Well, we know it happened.

1632
01:59:18,683 --> 01:59:20,606
SAM: I had it commissioned as art.

1633
01:59:20,606 --> 01:59:23,710
LAURA: Seen the tale throughout the mansion.

1634
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:29,994
TRAVIS: Can I ask for one other codeword if you
don't want us to step in? What if you want us to

1635
01:59:29,994 --> 01:59:31,485
create a distraction?

1636
01:59:31,485 --> 01:59:33,625
SAM: Okay, okay. What would that codeword be?

1637
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,072
TRAVIS: Kill everything.

1638
01:59:35,072 --> 01:59:46,720
SAM: Well, we <i>are</i> being honest on this trip,
right? "Kill everything," means make a

1639
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:51,372
distraction, right? But "Help, help, oh god,
help," means I need help.

1640
01:59:51,372 --> 01:59:53,733
TRAVIS: How about "tomato paste" to create a
distraction?

1641
01:59:53,733 --> 01:59:54,747
SAM: Tomato paste?

1642
01:59:54,747 --> 01:59:57,641
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I'll cover the walls in
tomato paste. But from people.

1643
01:59:57,641 --> 02:00:02,164
MARISHA: I feel like we need something that he
could use in a sentence very easily.

1644
02:00:02,164 --> 02:00:03,892
LIAM: What about "Love-a the spice?"

1645
02:00:03,892 --> 02:00:08,389
LAURA: "Love-a the spice," huh?

1646
02:00:08,389 --> 02:00:14,854
SAM: Let's stick with tomato paste. I feel like
that's easier to work into a sentence than "Love-a the spice."

1647
02:00:14,854 --> 02:00:22,545
LIAM: I don't doubt you could fit it in, Scanlan.
Let's be real, please.

1648
02:00:22,545 --> 02:00:33,135
SAM: Really nervous, guys. I've never done a drug
deal-- (whispers) a drug deal before.

1649
02:00:33,135 --> 02:00:35,413
LAURA: Are you sure this is even a drug?

1650
02:00:35,413 --> 02:00:41,027
SAM: Yes, of course! I said, "Spice. Spice.
Spice," And shady people came around. That means

1651
02:00:41,027 --> 02:00:42,274
it's a drug, right?

1652
02:00:42,274 --> 02:00:44,042
LAURA: Did you say what the spice was?

1653
02:00:44,042 --> 02:00:45,451
TALIESIN: Oregano.

1654
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:51,983
SAM: I told them. They seemed illicit about it.
I'm very excited!

1655
02:00:51,983 --> 02:00:55,230
LAURA: All right. You'll do a wonderful job.
You're so cool.

1656
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,616
TRAVIS: How far away is the casino?

1657
02:00:57,616 --> 02:01:01,979
SAM: Where is the casino? I wrote it down.

1658
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:04,393
TRAVIS: The north end?

1659
02:01:04,393 --> 02:01:07,995
SAM: It's where the Ravenites are. Nope! That's a
different page.

1660
02:01:07,995 --> 02:01:11,354
LAURA: Should we get in fancy casino clothes?
Because I feel like we'd dress up for it.

1661
02:01:11,354 --> 02:01:18,134
SAM: It's not The Debt's Respite. It is just The
Casino, right? Does it have a name?

1662
02:01:18,134 --> 02:01:23,375
MATT: It's called the Luck's Run and you feel like
you passed it when you first entered the Suncut

1663
02:01:23,375 --> 02:01:27,194
Bazaar here in the city. You didn't pay much mind
to it at the time.

1664
02:01:27,194 --> 02:01:32,107
LAURA: Is it shaped like a pyramid with a giant
light coming out the top? No?

1665
02:01:32,107 --> 02:01:34,070
MARISHA: Does it have a shitty roller coaster
attached?

1666
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:36,000
MATT: We'll find out.

1667
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,912
SAM: All right. I'm heading to the casino. Would
you all like to join me? And you can entertain

1668
02:01:41,912 --> 02:01:43,799
yourselves with some games while I--

1669
02:01:43,799 --> 02:01:44,959
LAURA: I cannot wait.

1670
02:01:44,959 --> 02:01:46,310
TALIESIN: I am <i>very</i> excited by this!

1671
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:47,920
MARISHA: I really enjoy the gambling!

1672
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,500
TALIESIN: I enjoy watching her gamble.

1673
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:52,645
MARISHA: Yes. But we are cool. We are chill.

1674
02:01:52,645 --> 02:01:56,416
TRAVIS: Should we wear costumes? Should I wear
my big pointy hat?

1675
02:01:56,416 --> 02:01:57,553
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes!

1676
02:01:57,553 --> 02:01:58,958
TRAVIS: I put the pointy hat on.

1677
02:01:58,958 --> 02:02:01,271
MATT: Looks fancy! And pointy!

1678
02:02:01,271 --> 02:02:04,266
TALIESIN: We're going to get changed for the
evening.

1679
02:02:04,266 --> 02:02:06,528
LAURA: Yes, can we get changed? Do we have enough
time?

1680
02:02:06,528 --> 02:02:10,440
MATT: You guys have your room in the Debt's
Respite, which is maybe like a 20-minute walk from--

1681
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,328
LAURA: Awesome clothes! For casino.

1682
02:02:13,328 --> 02:02:15,052
MARISHA: Look, it's a night out in Vegas, man.

1683
02:02:15,052 --> 02:02:16,687
TRAVIS: Didn't bring any extra clothes.

1684
02:02:16,687 --> 02:02:18,135
LAURA: We are hitting <i>the club</i>!

1685
02:02:18,135 --> 02:02:19,108
TRAVIS: We are adventurers.

1686
02:02:19,108 --> 02:02:20,292
LAURA: We're making it hail!

1687
02:02:20,292 --> 02:02:24,542
TALIESIN: This is not an animated series. We have
more than one pair of pants. Except for you.

1688
02:02:24,542 --> 02:02:28,507
SAM: I wear the same exact thing every day.

1689
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:30,359
LIAM: 20 of it?

1690
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:32,438
MATT: So Scanlan, you're wearing your normal clothes?

1691
02:02:32,438 --> 02:02:35,136
SAM: I'm putting my red shirt on.

1692
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:39,127
MATT: Yes, you are. Okay. So you guys go back to
The Debt's Respite. You get prepared for the evening,

1693
02:02:39,127 --> 02:02:46,016
dressed up in your finest attire at your disposal,
and walk your way back to where you believe this

1694
02:02:46,016 --> 02:02:48,074
casino was when you first entered the city.

1695
02:02:48,074 --> 02:02:53,654
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little frost on the edge
of my armor. So that I'm <i>cool.</i>

1696
02:02:53,654 --> 02:02:58,632
SAM: Just going to melt? Or does it--?

1697
02:02:58,632 --> 02:03:04,479
TRAVIS: That will be soggy. It will be soggy in
five minutes.

1698
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:06,454
LAURA: Now it looks like you've been sweating a
lot.

1699
02:03:06,454 --> 02:03:10,077
MARISHA: Guys, just tell me I look cool.

1700
02:03:10,077 --> 02:03:11,391
LAURA: You look so cool, Keyleth.

1701
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:16,298
TALIESIN: I think I do know a way to make the
frost hold. I could science it. I could frost-hold it.

1702
02:03:16,298 --> 02:03:17,968
MATT: What would you like to do?

1703
02:03:17,968 --> 02:03:20,890
TALIESIN: Add about 15% sawdust ratio to it
and it should hold its form even at a high

1704
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:22,093
temperature.

1705
02:03:22,093 --> 02:03:23,956
LIAM: Well, can't she keep the cantrip going for
about--

1706
02:03:23,956 --> 02:03:26,527
MARISHA: For a little bit. It is a cantrip. I'm
kind of badass now.

1707
02:03:26,527 --> 02:03:28,964
TRAVIS: Put that <i>shit</i> down! Put it down!

1708
02:03:28,964 --> 02:03:30,627
SAM: What, Travis? What is that?

1709
02:03:30,627 --> 02:03:33,549
TRAVIS: Put that damn mug down! I'll tear that
sticker.

1710
02:03:33,549 --> 02:03:34,900
SAM: What is it?

1711
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:40,665
TRAVIS: <i>How dare you!</i> I'm going to ruin this
transaction for you now.

1712
02:03:40,665 --> 02:03:53,049
MATT: All right. So the frost maintains itself as
a high-level druid. This is a simple glamor-based

1713
02:03:53,049 --> 02:03:54,520
cantrip to maintain.

1714
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:55,726
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, it is!

1715
02:03:55,726 --> 02:03:59,835
LAURA: Can you glamor me to not look like I have a
giant slash through my chest anymore?

1716
02:03:59,835 --> 02:04:04,986
MARISHA: Or totally, I do, like a little, give her
a little bit of concealer. A little bit of

1717
02:04:04,986 --> 02:04:06,934
foundation, a little powder.

1718
02:04:06,934 --> 02:04:11,201
MATT: Easy enough. You guys look rather fancy as a
traveling group. Do you travel together?

1719
02:04:11,201 --> 02:04:12,796
LAURA: No.

1720
02:04:12,796 --> 02:04:14,055
TALIESIN: I'm with Keyleth.

1721
02:04:14,055 --> 02:04:16,670
LIAM: I'm babysitting Scanlan at a distance.

1722
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:19,588
LAURA: Well, I guess I'm walking by myself.

1723
02:04:19,588 --> 02:04:21,505
TALIESIN: You can be with us.

1724
02:04:21,505 --> 02:04:24,253
TRAVIS: I'm very rich, wealthy. I'm alone.

1725
02:04:24,253 --> 02:04:25,738
SAM: You're a high-roller?

1726
02:04:25,738 --> 02:04:27,642
LAURA: Oh, Percy, do you want to look like you
have ladies?

1727
02:04:27,642 --> 02:04:28,931
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

1728
02:04:28,931 --> 02:04:30,470
LAURA: So rich. All right.

1729
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:34,285
TRAVIS: I walk around double-fisting both bottles
of the sandkheg.

1730
02:04:34,285 --> 02:04:35,891
SAM: Oh, yeah!

1731
02:04:35,891 --> 02:04:37,560
LIAM: That went from terrible to great.

1732
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,450
TRAVIS: Just rolling in. Rolling in deep.

1733
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:41,829
SAM: Wait. Have you even tasted it yet?

1734
02:04:41,829 --> 02:04:42,865
TRAVIS: Nope.

1735
02:04:42,865 --> 02:04:44,515
(laughter)

1736
02:04:44,515 --> 02:04:47,597
LAURA: And then me and Keyleth are on Percy's
arms.

1737
02:04:47,597 --> 02:04:48,645
MARISHA: Yes. We are.

1738
02:04:48,645 --> 02:04:50,379
TALIESIN: We are Vegas-ing.

1739
02:04:50,379 --> 02:04:51,994
MATT: You stealth.

1740
02:04:51,994 --> 02:04:53,127
LIAM: Yeah.

1741
02:04:53,127 --> 02:04:54,510
LAURA: Wow!

1742
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:55,660
LIAM: Natural 20.

1743
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:56,684
SAM: Wow!

1744
02:04:56,684 --> 02:04:57,554
TRAVIS: What?

1745
02:04:57,554 --> 02:04:58,883
LAURA: Stealthing like a motherfucker.

1746
02:04:58,883 --> 02:05:00,275
LIAM: So that's a 35.

1747
02:05:00,275 --> 02:05:05,269
MATT: You somehow are no longer in the narrative.
You stealth out of the story.

1748
02:05:05,269 --> 02:05:07,473
TALIESIN: You've been retconned, even.

1749
02:05:07,473 --> 02:05:09,580
MATT: Vax was never there.

1750
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,838
LIAM: Got you, Scan-man.

1751
02:05:11,838 --> 02:05:14,512
SAM: Who said that?

1752
02:05:14,512 --> 02:05:19,786
MATT: You guys approach the outskirts of the
building you saw on the way in. What you see

1753
02:05:19,786 --> 02:05:25,527
before you, with the little bit of light that
dapples the edge of the Suncut Bazaar reflects

1754
02:05:25,527 --> 02:05:34,290
across metallic framing on the sides of the
building. The walls appear to be dark wood leafed

1755
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:39,563
with brass and gold, a beacon of precious metal at
many points throughout the structure. It looks to

1756
02:05:39,563 --> 02:05:44,680
be three stories in its entirety. A half-dozen
armed guards not adorned in the guise of the Hands

1757
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:50,016
of Ord stand at each entrance, probably privately
owned by the establishment, and you hear loud

1758
02:05:50,016 --> 02:05:56,137
music and cheering bursting from within. You catch
a chiseled signed across each doorway arch that

1759
02:05:56,137 --> 02:05:59,279
read "Drensala Quan: Luck's Run."

1760
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:01,374
LAURA: What does that mean?

1761
02:06:01,374 --> 02:06:04,096
MARISHA: Ren-sa-la quan?

1762
02:06:04,096 --> 02:06:09,487
MATT: Drensala Quan, which is the Marquesian speak
for "Luck's Run" with the Common translation

1763
02:06:09,487 --> 02:06:10,929
beneath it.

1764
02:06:10,929 --> 02:06:13,750
LAURA: Okay, I understand.

1765
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:20,226
MATT: So as you at your own paces walk through the
front doors, the scents of sweat, perfumes, and

1766
02:06:20,226 --> 02:06:25,433
tobacco immediately hit your nostrils, as the
lively melodies of two musical groups compete from

1767
02:06:25,433 --> 02:06:29,682
across the establishment, forming a strange
discordant sound towards the center of the main

1768
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:35,633
room. Large square tables draped in crimson cloth
fill the space from one end to the other,

1769
02:06:35,633 --> 02:06:41,992
different shapes and sizes, crowds of different
numbers huddled around each. You see three dozen

1770
02:06:41,992 --> 02:06:47,860
patrons of all walks of life tending to their
various games of chance. Card tables, dice games,

1771
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:55,641
even a small contained race table in the far
corner stir cheers and anguish. You see

1772
02:06:55,641 --> 02:06:56,528
servants--

1773
02:06:56,528 --> 02:06:58,284
MARISHA: No, wait, what are they racing? I go over
to there.

1774
02:06:58,284 --> 02:07:00,816
LAURA: Already? I'm looking for craps.

1775
02:07:00,816 --> 02:07:07,143
MATT: Servants dressed in uniformed long shirts of
dark gray and gold to match the building's

1776
02:07:07,143 --> 02:07:12,598
exterior rush drinks, food, and coin between
tables as you begin to push through the crowd. You

1777
02:07:12,598 --> 02:07:21,553
come upon, Keyleth, first, as you push past, to
the far room there is a long table with a series

1778
02:07:21,553 --> 02:07:30,385
of curved, almost miniature maze-like paths and
there are five paths that all run alongside each

1779
02:07:30,385 --> 02:07:38,035
other. As you glance over the crowd, you see five
desert lizards about that long that are all being

1780
02:07:38,035 --> 02:07:43,373
held in cages at one end. And you see a bunch of
individuals that are currently in the process of

1781
02:07:43,373 --> 02:07:47,314
setting bets down on the central table with a
number of colored squares around it. They're

1782
02:07:47,314 --> 02:07:50,663
putting different amounts stacked up on the side,
and they're all speaking in a language you don't

1783
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:55,198
understand. As you approach and glance over, some
of them stop and glance over their shoulder at

1784
02:07:55,198 --> 02:08:00,675
you, and then go back about their business, not
paying attention.

1785
02:08:00,675 --> 02:08:05,672
MARISHA: They're doing their own thing? Okay. How
far away am I from the lizards?

1786
02:08:05,672 --> 02:08:10,342
MATT: About seven feet?

1787
02:08:10,342 --> 02:08:13,203
MARISHA: Can I go up to them? Or are they behind a
gate?

1788
02:08:13,203 --> 02:08:19,437
MATT: They're all in these very well-crafted cages
side-by-side at the far end of a table, right next

1789
02:08:19,437 --> 02:08:23,999
to where all the bets are being placed. And there
look to be two guards flanking them and one man at

1790
02:08:23,999 --> 02:08:28,631
the very end of the table that currently looks to
have his hand on a single doorway that is at the

1791
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:33,701
front of these cages and is in the process of
currently counting up and keeping track of all the

1792
02:08:33,701 --> 02:08:35,437
best that are being placed.

1793
02:08:35,437 --> 02:08:40,454
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go up to the guy.

1794
02:08:40,454 --> 02:08:44,405
MATT: Okay. You walk up to him. (speaking in
Marquesian)

1795
02:08:44,405 --> 02:08:46,308
TALIESIN: We'll keep a couple feet behind.

1796
02:08:46,308 --> 02:08:50,587
MATT: He's writing little notes, checking on the
lizards, making little notes, and as you walk up

1797
02:08:50,587 --> 02:08:52,893
he looks at you. "Yes, may I help you?"

1798
02:08:52,893 --> 02:08:54,424
MARISHA: Yes, be pleased.

1799
02:08:54,424 --> 02:08:55,802
MATT: "Be pleased."

1800
02:08:55,802 --> 02:09:00,706
MARISHA: What are these magnificent creatures
you're racing?

1801
02:09:00,706 --> 02:09:02,745
MATT: "Have you not played this before?"

1802
02:09:02,745 --> 02:09:07,017
MARISHA: No, I'm a tourist, so I'm brand new.

1803
02:09:07,017 --> 02:09:17,730
MATT: "This is my surprised face. This is Quan a
Drensal, or The Run of Luck. It is a traditional

1804
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:26,443
"old Marquet game of chance. It's what the casino
is partially named after. It was founded on this

1805
02:09:26,443 --> 02:09:35,353
"particular sport, if you will. People bet on which
lizard reaches the end first. Then the people who

1806
02:09:35,353 --> 02:09:43,047
"choose correctly make a profit. The second makes
half back what was bet. The rest lose all to the house."

1807
02:09:43,047 --> 02:09:48,115
MARISHA: Is it possible for me to get a closer
look at the specimens you are racing?

1808
02:09:48,115 --> 02:09:50,331
MATT: "Why?"

1809
02:09:50,331 --> 02:10:02,301
MARISHA: I'm a purveyor of fabulous beasts and I
just want to see these fabulous creatures you're

1810
02:10:02,301 --> 02:10:04,194
raising and racing.

1811
02:10:04,194 --> 02:10:05,545
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1812
02:10:05,545 --> 02:10:08,196
MARISHA: God damn it; this is not what I'm good
at.

1813
02:10:08,196 --> 02:10:12,596
TALIESIN: Nope.

1814
02:10:12,686 --> 02:10:14,778
MARISHA: Ten!

1815
02:10:14,778 --> 02:10:20,067
MATT: He goes, "If you wish to put down enough
money to make it worth my while to inspect your

1816
02:10:20,067 --> 02:10:27,686
"investment then perhaps we can talk. However
tourists I keep away from the money making."

1817
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:29,605
MARISHA: How does 200 gold sound?

1818
02:10:29,605 --> 02:10:30,950
SAM: Well, shit.

1819
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:37,627
MATT: "Well, that is higher than the 25 gold
minimum buy-in, so yes. Which of the lizards would

1820
02:10:37,627 --> 02:10:44,464
"you like to bet on? We have Rul, Sonpa, Thordak,
Wendis, and Devo'ssa."

1821
02:10:44,464 --> 02:10:50,164
MARISHA: What did you just say? Sorry, what was
the third name that you said?

1822
02:10:50,164 --> 02:10:51,608
MATT: "Thordak."

1823
02:10:51,608 --> 02:10:53,009
MARISHA: Did you say Thordak?

1824
02:10:53,009 --> 02:10:54,235
MATT: "Yes."

1825
02:10:54,235 --> 02:10:57,788
MARISHA: What a fascinating name. Where did that
one come from?

1826
02:10:57,788 --> 02:11:00,801
MATT: "It came from the stupid bastard that
attacked this city hundreds of years ago."

1827
02:11:00,801 --> 02:11:05,345
MARISHA: Oh, wow, yeah. No, I was just wondering
if there was any correlation.

1828
02:11:05,345 --> 02:11:07,482
SAM: Always bid on Thordak.

1829
02:11:07,482 --> 02:11:10,062
MATT: "Because it's a tiny, puny piece of shit
lizard. Of course it is."

1830
02:11:10,062 --> 02:11:13,542
MARISHA: Can I get a closer look at them?

1831
02:11:13,542 --> 02:11:15,459
MATT: "Which one are you betting on?"

1832
02:11:15,459 --> 02:11:22,340
MARISHA: I would like to get a closer look at them
before I decide on where to put my well-earned

1833
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,693
money.

1834
02:11:23,693 --> 02:11:31,303
MATT: He stands back and the two guards muscle a
little closer as he goes, "Have a look." And you lean

1835
02:11:31,303 --> 02:11:40,386
forward and glance across the front of the cages.
They all have this reddish-yellow sand-type scaled

1836
02:11:40,386 --> 02:11:47,373
exterior; darker at the top and lighter on the
underbelly. And they're all pretty much the same

1837
02:11:47,373 --> 02:11:52,903
size; age may differ; you can't really tell which
ones are healthy or not from this distance. What

1838
02:11:52,903 --> 02:11:53,991
are you looking for?

1839
02:11:53,991 --> 02:11:56,195
MARISHA: How close are the guys to me?

1840
02:11:56,195 --> 02:12:01,115
MATT: To you? There a like foot from you maybe.
They're both being very careful. They're watching

1841
02:12:01,115 --> 02:12:02,311
you very closely.

1842
02:12:02,311 --> 02:12:07,501
TALIESIN: I'm going to engage the man in a bit of
conversation. So is it a straight bet across or

1843
02:12:07,501 --> 02:12:12,656
are there competing numbers based on historical
averages for these creatures at this point? Where

1844
02:12:12,656 --> 02:12:13,950
is the money going, at the moment?

1845
02:12:13,950 --> 02:12:21,134
MATT: "The money right now, we have currently a
total of 750 gold pieces placed in total on the

1846
02:12:21,134 --> 02:12:26,592
"Rul who has apparently been doing very well for
the day. Sonpa has been failing miserably but it

1847
02:12:26,592 --> 02:12:32,697
"might be the underdog, who knows; they're all in
equal health. And the variations can be plenty.

1848
02:12:32,697 --> 02:12:45,769
"Wendis is okay; Thordak has characteristically no
votes. De'vossa has a decent amount. It is up to you.

1849
02:12:45,769 --> 02:12:46,951
"What do you wish?"

1850
02:12:46,951 --> 02:12:51,367
MARISHA: While they're having this conversation,
I'm going to lean into the lizards and cast Speak

1851
02:12:51,367 --> 02:12:52,630
with Animals.

1852
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:56,041
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a sleight of
hand check.

1853
02:12:56,041 --> 02:12:57,589
MARISHA: Very under my breath.

1854
02:12:57,589 --> 02:12:59,413
SAM: Getting tossed from the casino.

1855
02:12:59,413 --> 02:13:00,610
MARISHA: Here we go again!

1856
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:03,884
MATT: Well, let's have a look at Speak with
Animals. Let's see exactly what components it

1857
02:13:03,884 --> 02:13:06,201
requires.

1858
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:07,087
MARISHA: Oh no.

1859
02:13:07,087 --> 02:13:08,928
MATT: Because this is going to largely--

1860
02:13:08,928 --> 02:13:10,331
MARISHA: Very discreetly.

1861
02:13:10,331 --> 02:13:14,521
MATT: Verbal and somatic so yeah. Sleight of
hand.

1862
02:13:14,521 --> 02:13:19,271
SAM: What is that?

1863
02:13:19,271 --> 02:13:22,220
TALIESIN: That's a one.

1864
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:23,352
LAURA: Is that a one?

1865
02:13:23,352 --> 02:13:24,699
TALIESIN: Of course it's a one.

1866
02:13:24,699 --> 02:13:26,278
LAURA: Oh no! Keyleth, don't get arrested again!

1867
02:13:26,278 --> 02:13:27,972
TRAVIS: You're like the biggest felon of our
group.

1868
02:13:27,972 --> 02:13:34,526
MATT: Not even two minutes in the Luck's Front
Casino, you lean forward and begin muttering

1869
02:13:34,526 --> 02:13:39,666
beneath your breath the various druidic
incantations and as your fingers begin to

1870
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:44,654
manipulate the spectrums of divine energies in
your hand, a giant, meaty arm claps down on your hand

1871
02:13:44,654 --> 02:13:50,884
and pulls you to the side, and the guard pulls you
off your feet at his face. "Excuse me, are you

1872
02:13:50,884 --> 02:13:52,837
"trying to do funny business?"

1873
02:13:52,837 --> 02:13:57,463
MARISHA: I'm very bad at funny. You talk to other
people in our group for funny.

1874
02:13:57,463 --> 02:13:59,142
TALIESIN: I'm ignoring this.

1875
02:13:59,142 --> 02:14:03,067
MATT: "You are out of the Run." And the other
gentleman grabs your shoulder and they begin

1876
02:14:03,067 --> 02:14:05,451
pushing you out, towards the exit of the Luck's Run.

1877
02:14:05,451 --> 02:14:07,858
MARISHA: Oh, don't, come on, man. Look--

1878
02:14:07,858 --> 02:14:10,127
MATT: Anybody do anything?

1879
02:14:10,127 --> 02:14:11,638
TRAVIS: Nope.

1880
02:14:11,638 --> 02:14:16,441
MATT: All right. As you're conversing with this
gentleman, you watch as Keyleth gets pushed very

1881
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:20,693
forcefully towards the back door on the opposite
side of the chamber and kicked out onto the

1882
02:14:20,693 --> 02:14:26,031
street; like full on boot-to-the-ass, about a
three foot arc before slamming onto the dark red

1883
02:14:26,031 --> 02:14:29,583
cobblestone streets of the Suncut Bazaar.

1884
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:39,633
MARISHA: You guys. I just got kicked out of a
casino! I'm so cool! I'm cool, Scanlan, I'm cool!

1885
02:14:39,633 --> 02:14:42,646
MATT: By the way, you lost your concentration and
currently the shoulders are now dampered.

1886
02:14:42,646 --> 02:14:45,618
MARISHA: Guys, I'm a little soggy, but I'm so
cool!

1887
02:14:45,618 --> 02:14:49,243
LAURA: That was really cool, Keyleth.

1888
02:14:49,243 --> 02:14:53,957
TALIESIN: I think I'll put 25 on Thordak.

1889
02:14:53,957 --> 02:14:56,018
KEYLETH: Yeah, can I forward my bet?

1890
02:14:56,018 --> 02:14:57,868
TALIESIN: Let's put 25 on Thordak.

1891
02:14:57,868 --> 02:14:59,169
LAURA: I'm not putting any money on Thordak.

1892
02:14:59,169 --> 02:15:00,424
MATT: You never actually put your money down.

1893
02:15:00,424 --> 02:15:02,276
MARISHA: Oh good, I didn't lose 200 gold.

1894
02:15:02,276 --> 02:15:04,505
TALIESIN: I'm going to put 25 on Thordak.

1895
02:15:04,505 --> 02:15:07,747
LAURA: I'm going to put 25 on the second one that
doesn't have any bets.

1896
02:15:07,747 --> 02:15:13,997
MATT: Okay, let's see here; we have 25 on Thordak
and then we have--

1897
02:15:13,997 --> 02:15:16,311
LAURA: The one that you said hasn't--

1898
02:15:16,311 --> 02:15:19,035
MATT: Which is Sonpa.

1899
02:15:19,035 --> 02:15:23,379
LIAM: If it's any consolation, that was totally
adorable. Just wait outside for us; we'll be out

1900
02:15:23,379 --> 02:15:24,301
in a bit.

1901
02:15:24,301 --> 02:15:26,120
MATT: And how much money you put down?

1902
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:32,110
LAURA: 25 gold as well. All right, no, I don't want
to look like I'm putting down the minimum; that's

1903
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:33,316
pathetic.

1904
02:15:33,316 --> 02:15:35,253
TALIESIN: No, we're learning the game. No one's
going to give you anything. We're learning the

1905
02:15:35,253 --> 02:15:41,331
game. We don't have to be big spenders here.

1906
02:15:41,331 --> 02:15:45,136
LAURA: 25 gold. You've got to spend big to make
big, Percy.

1907
02:15:45,136 --> 02:15:46,973
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you've got to learn the game.

1908
02:15:46,973 --> 02:15:51,616
MATT: 25 gold buy-in for two of you on two
different lizards. 25 on Thordak, 25 on Sonpa. The

1909
02:15:51,616 --> 02:15:55,237
rest of the bets come in, they're marked down, the
coins are put on the table in corresponding

1910
02:15:55,237 --> 02:16:01,020
colors, you guys place them completely incorrectly,
and they correct them for you and glare. You watch

1911
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:07,395
as the gentleman who's running the event goes,
(Marquesian). He lifts up the front of

1912
02:16:07,395 --> 02:16:11,711
the gates, and all the lizards start
scurrying out rapidly. Everyone comes in real fast

1913
02:16:11,711 --> 02:16:15,181
and begins cheering and cheering and chanting the
different names of the people they put money on.

1914
02:16:15,181 --> 02:16:20,288
All right, as we come around, we are rolling for
each individual lizard for the entirety of this

1915
02:16:20,288 --> 02:16:22,309
endeavor. Yeah, I have rolls for all the different
lizards.

1916
02:16:22,309 --> 02:16:25,136
LAURA: Oh, that's adorable. Go underdog!

1917
02:16:25,136 --> 02:16:39,485
MATT: All right, so. Rul. Be prepared. All right.

1918
02:16:39,485 --> 02:16:43,293
SAM: He's just rolling once to see--

1919
02:16:43,293 --> 02:16:45,047
LAURA: Natural one.

1920
02:16:45,047 --> 02:16:47,007
MATT: It's 2d4 for each one to see how well they
do.

1921
02:16:47,007 --> 02:16:52,813
SAM: 2d4! It's your rules, you could do anything! It
could be 1d8! Why does it have to be 2d4?

1922
02:16:52,813 --> 02:16:58,798
TALIESIN: What a good excuse to finally order a d9
and have the d9 only for this game.

1923
02:16:58,798 --> 02:17:01,285
MARISHA: (giggles) Only for lizard racing.

1924
02:17:01,285 --> 02:17:04,002
SAM: Makes no sense!

1925
02:17:04,002 --> 02:17:09,528
MATT: And with that, you watch as they curve
around each corner, skittering forward and past.

1926
02:17:09,528 --> 02:17:13,512
They come around the far end and they come rushing
back on the opposite side of the table. People are

1927
02:17:13,512 --> 02:17:19,050
shouting. One gentleman to the left of you, Vex,
seems to have some large cigar-type thing and is

1928
02:17:19,050 --> 02:17:24,016
blustering out smoke in your vicinity, making you
cough a bit, but you're still focused on this. You

1929
02:17:24,016 --> 02:17:29,362
watch as Rul pulls ahead; Thordak pulls ahead and
pulls back. Sonpa pushes forward, and Wendis is

1930
02:17:29,362 --> 02:17:34,458
falling behind. De'vossa gets close and barely scoots
past, and De'vossa is the winner.

1931
02:17:34,536 --> 02:17:36,882
LAURA: Do I get anything for second place?

1932
02:17:36,882 --> 02:17:41,521
MATT: Second place, you get back half of what you
bet so you get 13 gold pieces back. You lose your

1933
02:17:41,521 --> 02:17:45,969
bet. A few other gentlemen seem to be happy and
collect their winnings, and far more seem to be

1934
02:17:45,969 --> 02:17:51,672
disappointed with the outcome. Some leave; a few
more fill the spaces and come back around. The Run

1935
02:17:51,672 --> 02:17:53,160
of Luck is complete.

1936
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,827
LIAM: What's it like outside?

1937
02:17:54,827 --> 02:17:57,402
MARISHA: (whispers) What's it like outside?

1938
02:17:57,402 --> 02:18:03,863
MATT: It's dark, but beautiful with the various
lanterns that are now lit. There's carts being

1939
02:18:03,863 --> 02:18:07,970
pulled by. Some folks are leaving for the evening,
some folks are bringing things into the bazaar.

1940
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:12,173
They prefer to actually shop during the evening, 
whatever their wares may be, you don't know. But it

1941
02:18:12,173 --> 02:18:13,119
seems lively.

1942
02:18:13,119 --> 02:18:17,021
MARISHA: It's dark, and I'm in a shady alleyway,
and I'm alone. It's great.

1943
02:18:17,021 --> 02:18:22,455
LIAM: You know, maybe go out to the front where
the people are. You don't need to be in the back

1944
02:18:22,455 --> 02:18:23,569
with the dumpster.

1945
02:18:23,569 --> 02:18:25,775
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I guess so. But it's so
pretty.

1946
02:18:25,775 --> 02:18:27,023
MATT: All right, so?

1947
02:18:27,023 --> 02:18:32,083
LAURA: It takes everything in my power not to keep
betting, but we should probably walk away.

1948
02:18:32,083 --> 02:18:35,769
TALIESIN: Let's try another game; I'm not feeling
this one. I don't like betting on live little--

1949
02:18:35,769 --> 02:18:38,582
LAURA: As we walk around, we keep an eye out for
Scanlan's red shirt.

1950
02:18:38,582 --> 02:18:42,601
SAM: I'm trying to wander away from them as best I
can.

1951
02:18:42,601 --> 02:18:45,567
MATT: Right. So you keep your way wandering
through the casino, looking over different

1952
02:18:45,567 --> 02:18:53,636
games and such. You come across a card game. This
one you've actually heard of it though you haven't

1953
02:18:53,636 --> 02:18:59,002
actually seen it played before. It's called the
Gambit of Ord. It's a competitive card game

1954
02:18:59,002 --> 02:19:08,029
between a group of card players at a table. That
actually has a buy in, but can raise per round

1955
02:19:08,029 --> 02:19:13,181
back and forth based on who drops out and who
doesn't. There is a dice game called Avandra's

1956
02:19:13,181 --> 02:19:22,777
Favor that involves you actually rolling 2d6 and
if you get either a seven or a 12, you win, but

1957
02:19:22,777 --> 02:19:27,662
you can double the bet to add an
additional d6 to try and get either a seven or a

1958
02:19:27,662 --> 02:19:30,161
12 if the numbers don't quite meet one or the
other.

1959
02:19:30,161 --> 02:19:32,877
SAM: Go there.

1960
02:19:32,877 --> 02:19:34,175
TALIESIN: We're going there.

1961
02:19:34,175 --> 02:19:36,169
MATT: So you go to the dice game.

1962
02:19:36,169 --> 02:19:37,027
LAURA: Yeah!

1963
02:19:37,027 --> 02:19:38,829
MATT: So you go to the Avandra's Favor tables.

1964
02:19:38,829 --> 02:19:40,070
LAURA: I want to use my gold dice.

1965
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:46,938
MATT: So you have to wait a moment as there is a
small line of people queued up to go ahead and

1966
02:19:46,938 --> 02:19:50,704
place their bets for the dice. Each person is
betting on each individual as they go in, whether

1967
02:19:50,704 --> 02:19:55,657
or not they're going to make it. You wait for
about 15 or so minutes before you watch a couple

1968
02:19:55,657 --> 02:20:02,055
folks lose horribly and walk away very
sorrowful about how much they lost in trying to

1969
02:20:02,055 --> 02:20:05,811
push their luck as they step away and it's finally
your turn. And the woman who's currently helping

1970
02:20:05,811 --> 02:20:08,622
this table goes, "And you, miss, you are here to
play?"

1971
02:20:08,622 --> 02:20:10,122
LAURA: This game.

1972
02:20:10,122 --> 02:20:11,984
MATT: "Yes, Avandra's Favor?"

1973
02:20:11,984 --> 02:20:12,970
LAURA: Yes, that!

1974
02:20:12,970 --> 02:20:17,490
MATT: "All right! So what is your initial bet, my
dear?"

1975
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:22,680
LAURA: I can't actually remember what you said the
rules were, so what's the minimum bet?

1976
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:24,643
MATT: "25 gold pieces."

1977
02:20:24,643 --> 02:20:25,761
LAURA: Okay.

1978
02:20:25,761 --> 02:20:27,180
TALIESIN: How much for the extended bet?

1979
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:28,600
MATT: How much do you want?

1980
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,768
TALIESIN: To get the third die?

1981
02:20:30,768 --> 02:20:32,527
SAM: I think you roll first--

1982
02:20:32,527 --> 02:20:34,876
LAURA: And then you add, you can double your bet
to add--

1983
02:20:34,876 --> 02:20:36,401
MATT: To add an additional die.

1984
02:20:36,401 --> 02:20:38,563
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to put 25 down, just
to see how it goes.

1985
02:20:38,563 --> 02:20:40,422
MATT: "25 gold pieces, please."

1986
02:20:40,422 --> 02:20:42,052
LAURA: Okay, here we go.

1987
02:20:42,052 --> 02:20:43,193
MATT: Mark that off.

1988
02:20:43,193 --> 02:20:44,911
LAURA: Oh, I'm marking.

1989
02:20:44,911 --> 02:20:49,883
MATT: She slides it into your square. "All right,
now, roll the dice, and may Avandra be with you."

1990
02:20:49,883 --> 02:20:51,195
LAURA: Okay, what am I rolling?

1991
02:20:51,195 --> 02:20:52,235
MATT: 2d6.

1992
02:20:52,235 --> 02:20:57,280
LAURA: 2d6. You got it. Where's my other?

1993
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:58,659
SAM: This is the most important roll--

1994
02:20:58,659 --> 02:21:03,304
LAURA: Of my life. They're gold dice, they're the
gold dice. Eight.

1995
02:21:03,304 --> 02:21:05,090
MATT: "Eight? Ah."

1996
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:09,438
LAURA: Oh god! This is a hard game! You lose
really easily!

1997
02:21:09,438 --> 02:21:13,005
MATT: "Beyond seven, very close! Now, I could take
the coin, or you could double your bet and add one

1998
02:21:13,005 --> 02:21:14,344
"more die."

1999
02:21:14,344 --> 02:21:16,313
LAURA: To get to 12?

2000
02:21:16,313 --> 02:21:20,863
TALIESIN: To get to 12, or any combination of
seven of two, or all three must be 12.

2001
02:21:20,863 --> 02:21:25,487
LAURA: All right, I'm going to double my bet and
I'm going to throw one more dice in the --

2002
02:21:25,487 --> 02:21:26,546
MATT: "50 gold."

2003
02:21:26,546 --> 02:21:27,432
LAURA: 50 gold, yes.

2004
02:21:27,432 --> 02:21:30,583
MATT: She takes the rest. All right, go ahead and
add one more dice. Eight plus--?

2005
02:21:30,583 --> 02:21:36,341
LAURA: Aw, it was almost a four! It was a five.

2006
02:21:36,341 --> 02:21:39,507
MATT: "Avandra is not by your side this moment. I
am so sorry."

2007
02:21:39,507 --> 02:21:42,798
LAURA: No, it's fine, it's really super-duper fun!

2008
02:21:42,798 --> 02:21:45,871
TALIESIN: I need to take a round of this as well.
All right, I'm going in as well.

2009
02:21:45,871 --> 02:21:47,976
MATT: "All right, 25 gold?"

2010
02:21:47,976 --> 02:21:50,755
TALIESIN: 25 gold from my wonderful--

2011
02:21:50,755 --> 02:21:54,171
MATT: "Now, roll the dice, and may Avandra be with
you."

2012
02:21:54,171 --> 02:21:55,743
MARISHA: Percy luck!

2013
02:21:55,743 --> 02:21:57,879
LIAM: Does it only work with 20s?

2014
02:21:57,879 --> 02:21:59,314
LAURA: He didn't even look.

2015
02:21:59,314 --> 02:22:00,427
SAM: Seven.

2016
02:22:00,427 --> 02:22:03,212
(cheering)

2017
02:22:03,212 --> 02:22:09,281
MATT: "First at the table! Avandra has kissed upon
your forehead! Please, take your winnings." And

2018
02:22:09,281 --> 02:22:11,110
she gives you 50 gold back.

2019
02:22:11,110 --> 02:22:17,733
LAURA: Ooh, 50 gold back? You should try it again.
You've made money now.

2020
02:22:17,733 --> 02:22:19,982
SAM: This is a streak at this point.

2021
02:22:19,982 --> 02:22:22,614
TALIESIN: I'll put 25 more in.

2022
02:22:22,614 --> 02:22:27,072
MATT: "25 gold? Oh, but you've already proven that
this has been conquerable. Are you sure 25 is all

2023
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,545
"you wish to pay?"

2024
02:22:28,545 --> 02:22:29,839
MARISHA: She's good.

2025
02:22:29,839 --> 02:22:34,218
MATT: "The goddess watches over you this moment.
How long she may last, we do not know!"

2026
02:22:34,218 --> 02:22:36,778
TALIESIN: 25 is fine. I don't believe in luck.

2027
02:22:36,778 --> 02:22:38,051
MATT: "Hmm."

2028
02:22:38,051 --> 02:22:39,329
LAURA: You should.

2029
02:22:39,329 --> 02:22:40,898
MATT: "Roll your dice."

2030
02:22:40,898 --> 02:22:43,223
TALIESIN: Six.

2031
02:22:43,223 --> 02:22:47,422
MATT: "Mm, unfortunate."

2032
02:22:47,422 --> 02:22:49,216
TALIESIN: I'll put in the 25 for one more die.

2033
02:22:49,216 --> 02:22:51,832
MATT: "All right, a bet of 50. Roll your one more
die."

2034
02:22:51,832 --> 02:22:56,705
TALIESIN: No.

2035
02:22:56,705 --> 02:22:59,681
MATT: "The goddess left you. Sorry."

2036
02:22:59,681 --> 02:23:03,500
TALIESIN: It was a wonderful thrill. Good
evening.

2037
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:05,336
MATT: "Good evening to you as well."

2038
02:23:05,336 --> 02:23:08,934
LAURA: I tip her two extra gold, because that's
what you're supposed to do.

2039
02:23:08,934 --> 02:23:15,745
MATT: "Thank you kindly. Next up!" And another
gentleman muscles past and throws down his coin.

2040
02:23:15,745 --> 02:23:21,530
"My turn!" He sits down, and other folks come in
and begin to watch his next turn go. As this is

2041
02:23:21,530 --> 02:23:24,151
happening, you're making your way through the
casino.

2042
02:23:24,151 --> 02:23:25,825
TALIESIN: Let's find the cheap drinks.

2043
02:23:25,825 --> 02:23:30,962
SAM: Yeah, I've forgotten, Matt, did they say to
meet in a specific spot, or was it they'll know

2044
02:23:30,962 --> 02:23:33,226
you from your red shirt?

2045
02:23:33,226 --> 02:23:34,421
MATT: They'll know you from your red shirt.

2046
02:23:34,421 --> 02:23:41,178
SAM: Okay, so then I am going up to, I'm walking
past some of the higher rollers that I see, and as

2047
02:23:41,178 --> 02:23:48,872
I walk past I'm going, (clears throat) I'm the
guy. I'm the guy. (clears throat) It's me.

2048
02:23:48,872 --> 02:23:54,778
(clears throat, whispers) I'm the guy. And keep 
walking if they don't--

2049
02:23:54,778 --> 02:23:59,489
MATT: About 20 minutes of this as you're watching
over, and some folks look down, expecting to see a

2050
02:23:59,489 --> 02:24:07,140
child, are spooked by it. In your time here,
you've only really come across maybe two other

2051
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:12,329
gnomes. They're not very prominent here in
Ank'Harel as a people, so some folks give you an

2052
02:24:12,329 --> 02:24:17,278
odd look to the side, a sideways glance as you
step around. At one point you do feel one hand

2053
02:24:17,278 --> 02:24:29,186
clasp onto your shoulder. You glance up and you
see a nice, billowing, dark blue silk shirt across

2054
02:24:29,186 --> 02:24:37,437
a half-orc gentleman with his hair slicked back,
short, over the edge of his scalp. He has a really

2055
02:24:37,437 --> 02:24:45,694
well-trimmed goatee and a very big hoop gold
earring in one ear. His hand is wrapped around

2056
02:24:45,694 --> 02:24:52,897
your shoulder and he goes, "So. Verdaven said we
are to speak, yes?"

2057
02:24:52,897 --> 02:24:55,427
SAM: Maybe.

2058
02:24:55,427 --> 02:25:00,366
MATT: "Well, then. Follow me to more private
quarters where we can have a conversation."

2059
02:25:00,366 --> 02:25:02,356
SAM: Lead the way.

2060
02:25:02,356 --> 02:25:06,940
MATT: He releases your shoulder and begins walking
up the stairs to the second floor.

2061
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:09,414
SAM: I'll join him.

2062
02:25:09,414 --> 02:25:10,771
MATT: All right.

2063
02:25:10,771 --> 02:25:12,472
LAURA: Did we see him walking up the stairs?

2064
02:25:12,472 --> 02:25:13,670
MATT: Make a perception check.

2065
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:14,870
TALIESIN: I'll join in that perception check.

2066
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:17,133
MATT: You kept your eye the whole time, that was
your goal, so you see this happen.

2067
02:25:17,133 --> 02:25:18,822
MARISHA: Guys, get me a drink!

2068
02:25:18,822 --> 02:25:21,689
TALIESIN: 21.

2069
02:25:21,689 --> 02:25:23,508
LAURA: 15.

2070
02:25:23,508 --> 02:25:32,205
MATT: Okay. So yeah, Percy, Vax, and Vex, all
three of you see Scanlan led upstairs, trailing

2071
02:25:32,205 --> 02:25:35,012
behind this well-dressed half-orc individual.

2072
02:25:35,012 --> 02:25:36,985
MARISHA: If they have a Chardonnay?

2073
02:25:36,985 --> 02:25:39,085
TALIESIN: I was going to go red.

2074
02:25:39,085 --> 02:25:43,641
MARISHA: That works. A Shiraz would be
phenomenal.

2075
02:25:43,641 --> 02:25:45,914
MATT: You guys following, or are you staying where
you are?

2076
02:25:45,914 --> 02:25:51,318
LIAM: These stairs are peopled? Or are they empty
other than Scanlan and this other guy?

2077
02:25:51,318 --> 02:25:56,372
MATT: Occasional foot traffic up and down. There
does appear to be one of the various hired

2078
02:25:56,372 --> 02:26:03,386
ruffians to keep the peace around this vicinity at
the landing, up where the stairs stop and then

2079
02:26:03,386 --> 02:26:04,692
head further up.

2080
02:26:04,692 --> 02:26:08,110
LAURA: Is the gambling only at the first level, or
is it up higher levels as well?

2081
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:09,677
MATT: You haven't been to the second floor.

2082
02:26:09,677 --> 02:26:14,459
LAURA: I think I'll, after a little bit, grab a
drink and then--

2083
02:26:14,459 --> 02:26:15,591
TALIESIN: Drunkenly head up.

2084
02:26:15,591 --> 02:26:16,468
LAURA: Yeah.

2085
02:26:16,468 --> 02:26:17,787
MATT: Okay. So you guys head to get a drink.

2086
02:26:17,787 --> 02:26:19,346
LIAM: Can I ride my 20 up the stairs?

2087
02:26:19,346 --> 02:26:23,950
MATT: I'd say at this point, because you're no
longer hiding in a corner, you're actually

2088
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:27,034
entering a social place, you'll have to go ahead
and roll another stealth check.

2089
02:26:27,034 --> 02:26:31,035
LIAM: That's fine, 31.

2090
02:26:31,035 --> 02:26:38,523
MATT: Okay. So as opposed to just being out of
sight, you are trained in the idea of blending in,

2091
02:26:38,523 --> 02:26:43,504
making various subtle movements to not catch
anyone's attention, and to match the energy of the

2092
02:26:43,504 --> 02:26:49,028
room about you so as to not stand out amongst the
crowd. You adjust some of your clothing to match

2093
02:26:49,028 --> 02:26:54,450
some of the shoulder-tossed shawls that some of
the folks in here wear, and you naturally fall

2094
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:58,429
into the general atmosphere of the casino.

2095
02:26:58,429 --> 02:27:02,603
LIAM: I'm still wearing the fancy whites that
Percival put over me the other day.

2096
02:27:02,603 --> 02:27:09,331
MATT: Not a worry. You follow up the stairs and up
top you do see there are a couple more tables in a

2097
02:27:09,331 --> 02:27:15,473
center room, and six doors on each side of this
long run, before another staircase heads up to the

2098
02:27:15,473 --> 02:27:20,749
third floor of this establishment. The half-orc
walks to the fourth door on the left, pulls out a

2099
02:27:20,749 --> 02:27:26,432
key, pulls the door open, glances over his
shoulder for a second, and enters the room.

2100
02:27:26,432 --> 02:27:28,620
SAM: I will gladly follow.

2101
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:36,381
MATT: As you turn the corner and enter the room,
there is a singular table. There are two chairs

2102
02:27:36,381 --> 02:27:39,712
facing each other. There appears to be some small--

2103
02:27:39,712 --> 02:27:42,041
(mooing in music track)

2104
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:44,261
TALIESIN: There's an ox in the corner.

2105
02:27:44,261 --> 02:27:46,741
LIAM: You can do anything you want in this place.

2106
02:27:46,741 --> 02:27:49,750
TALIESIN: How much for ten minutes with the ox? Be
fair.

2107
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:55,350
MATT: As you enter the room, you see there are a
few tables on the far side. There is a window that

2108
02:27:55,350 --> 02:28:02,390
looks out that is currently closed, and the
half-orc is now standing on the opposite side of

2109
02:28:02,390 --> 02:28:03,902
the table.

2110
02:28:03,902 --> 02:28:08,445
SAM: (clears throat) So what have you got for me?

2111
02:28:08,445 --> 02:28:10,155
MATT: You enter and sit down?

2112
02:28:10,155 --> 02:28:11,563
SAM: Oh, yes, I enter and sit down.

2113
02:28:11,563 --> 02:28:15,956
MATT: Okay, you sit down. As you sit down, the
door closes behind you and you see the half-elf that

2114
02:28:15,956 --> 02:28:24,702
you had met earlier in the alleyway was behind the
door, walks around and leaves the room, closing

2115
02:28:24,702 --> 02:28:33,902
the door behind him. You hear (lock clicking). The
half-orc has sat down and goes, "So you were

2116
02:28:33,902 --> 02:28:36,707
"asking about spice."

2117
02:28:36,707 --> 02:28:39,675
SAM: Again, maybe.

2118
02:28:39,675 --> 02:28:49,701
MATT: "Specifically, if I am to understand, 200
gold worth of fusaka?"

2119
02:28:49,701 --> 02:28:53,859
SAM: Maybe more, if it's of a higher quality.

2120
02:28:53,859 --> 02:29:04,388
MATT: "Well. Let it be known that I brought, just
in case, twice the amount." He reaches off to the

2121
02:29:04,388 --> 02:29:08,620
side and opens one of the small cupboards that's
part of the table arrangement on that side of the

2122
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:15,047
room, and pulls out two satchels that are about
that big around each, and lifts them both, one

2123
02:29:15,047 --> 02:29:23,299
after the other, onto the table. They are tied at
the very top. It's a high-quality burlap-type

2124
02:29:23,299 --> 02:29:29,061
material on the outside, only the weave is much
tighter so it's not liable to leak or stumble out.

2125
02:29:29,061 --> 02:29:40,670
"So it is difficult to acquire this. I would say
one for 250, or both for 400 gold."

2126
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:46,268
SAM: How do I know it's of a quality I'm
accustomed to, from my homeland?

2127
02:29:46,268 --> 02:29:52,684
MATT: "Because I have a reputation to uphold. If
you wish not to have any, perhaps you find

2128
02:29:52,684 --> 02:29:55,707
"business with less viable options."

2129
02:29:55,707 --> 02:30:03,568
SAM: Forgive me, I'm not from around here. I don't
know of your reputation. Could I possibly have a

2130
02:30:03,568 --> 02:30:05,429
sample to see?

2131
02:30:05,429 --> 02:30:09,119
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2132
02:30:09,119 --> 02:30:13,768
LIAM: While he's doing that, I'm pretending to
sort of drunkenly lean on the wall outside that door.

2133
02:30:13,768 --> 02:30:15,607
TALIESIN: Did that just happen?

2134
02:30:15,607 --> 02:30:16,602
LAURA: What was it?

2135
02:30:16,602 --> 02:30:17,624
SAM: 20.

2136
02:30:17,624 --> 02:30:18,971
(yelling)

2137
02:30:18,971 --> 02:30:28,117
MATT: All right. As you glance and look around the
side, you can see a tan-skinned half-elf in robes

2138
02:30:28,117 --> 02:30:34,581
waiting impatiently with his back against the door
that you barely saw Scanlan disappear into after

2139
02:30:34,581 --> 02:30:43,648
he walked out. He gives you a look over. "Should
you wish, but be careful not to inhale too

2140
02:30:43,648 --> 02:30:49,003
"deeply." Then he takes the rope and unfurls and
unties it, takes the satchel, and pushes it over

2141
02:30:49,003 --> 02:30:50,397
towards you.

2142
02:30:50,397 --> 02:30:51,538
SAM: The whole satchel?

2143
02:30:51,538 --> 02:30:52,518
MATT: The entire satchel.

2144
02:30:52,518 --> 02:30:54,223
TRAVIS: Do you know if it's a powder, or a plant?

2145
02:30:54,223 --> 02:30:55,775
LIAM: It's the cinnamon challenge.

2146
02:30:55,775 --> 02:30:56,944
LAURA: What does it look like?

2147
02:30:56,944 --> 02:30:58,384
SAM: Yeah, what does it look like?

2148
02:30:58,384 --> 02:31:01,877
MATT: Well, it's halfway across the table. You go
ahead and pull it towards you?

2149
02:31:01,877 --> 02:31:03,365
SAM: Oh, I'll pull it towards me, yeah.

2150
02:31:03,365 --> 02:31:08,058
MATT: It's a little heavier than you expected.
It's not a light thing, it's a very heavy

2151
02:31:08,058 --> 02:31:16,994
material. As you pull it forward, it looks like
very, very finely mulched bark almost, or

2152
02:31:16,994 --> 02:31:25,441
shavings, and it has this pungent smell like dried
cheese with a hint of cedar.

2153
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:33,344
SAM: What is this shit! It's not a fine powder,
it's chunky?

2154
02:31:33,344 --> 02:31:41,425
MATT: It's chunky to an extent, and as you're
looking over it, he goes, "It requires additional

2155
02:31:41,425 --> 02:31:43,838
"refining for use, of course."

2156
02:31:43,838 --> 02:31:45,825
SAM: Of course. This isn't my first rodeo,
friend.

2157
02:31:45,825 --> 02:31:48,508
TRAVIS: Put it in your lip, put it in your lip!

2158
02:31:48,508 --> 02:31:55,444
SAM: Being that I play stringed instruments, I
have long nails, so I'll take my pinky and sort of

2159
02:31:55,444 --> 02:32:04,788
dip down and get a little on the end of my pinky,
smell it a bit, on my gums a little bit.

2160
02:32:04,788 --> 02:32:07,019
TALIESIN: Sweet Christmas.

2161
02:32:07,019 --> 02:32:10,036
LAURA: The cedar wood chips.

2162
02:32:10,036 --> 02:32:19,519
MATT: The smell is strong, and the taste is
stronger. It is not pleasant to the tongue. The

2163
02:32:19,519 --> 02:32:27,082
aftertaste does have a unique zest to it. There is
a slight numbness, and while the initial flavor is

2164
02:32:27,082 --> 02:32:34,414
awful, the lingering flavor is actually quite
nice, like a spiced meat almost. It catches you

2165
02:32:34,414 --> 02:32:35,540
off guard.

2166
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:37,857
SAM: Spiced meat. Am I feeling high at all?

2167
02:32:37,857 --> 02:32:40,434
MATT: Make a constitution check.

2168
02:32:40,434 --> 02:32:43,439
MARISHA: How fast is your metabolism?

2169
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:47,485
SAM: Constitution check? I've never checked my
constitution --

2170
02:32:47,485 --> 02:32:48,909
MATT: Saving throw.

2171
02:32:48,909 --> 02:32:51,692
SAM: Saving throw. Well, either way it's 16.

2172
02:32:51,692 --> 02:32:57,384
MATT: 16, okay. Best you can tell there's no
immediate effect. You don't know what it's

2173
02:32:57,384 --> 02:33:01,990
supposed to do. It doesn't seem to be having an
effect on you at the moment.

2174
02:33:01,990 --> 02:33:10,545
SAM: I'll do a little bit more. Get it on my
tongue.

2175
02:33:10,545 --> 02:33:11,834
TRAVIS: Up the nose?

2176
02:33:11,834 --> 02:33:14,099
SAM: (sniffing) Just a little bit more to see if
it's doing anything.

2177
02:33:14,099 --> 02:33:16,818
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw.

2178
02:33:16,818 --> 02:33:18,195
SAM: 16.

2179
02:33:18,195 --> 02:33:22,807
MATT: Still seemingly no effect, and you can see
the half-orc is starting to get a little impatient

2180
02:33:22,807 --> 02:33:27,381
and frustrated. "So you have tried of the wares.
Are you satisfied?"

2181
02:33:27,381 --> 02:33:37,798
SAM: I'm not dead. I guess that's good. You know,
where I'm from sometimes we burn it and inhale it

2182
02:33:37,798 --> 02:33:42,271
that way. Is that done? What methods do you guys
use here?

2183
02:33:42,271 --> 02:33:49,390
MATT: His head pulls back a bit and he goes, "You
may do as you wish with it upon purchasing. That

2184
02:33:49,390 --> 02:33:57,110
"is up to you. I am a little worried that you may
not be regulating your intake."

2185
02:33:57,110 --> 02:34:08,722
SAM: Don't worry about me, friend, all right? My
mom and dad, that's their job, all right? All

2186
02:34:08,722 --> 02:34:20,485
right. I guess I'll take it. Your reputation and
the seeming good quality makes me believe that

2187
02:34:20,485 --> 02:34:28,652
this is of a fine caliber, quality, how that's--
ugh. Stings a little in the eyes, that's all.

2188
02:34:28,652 --> 02:34:30,471
MATT: "That it would."

2189
02:34:30,471 --> 02:34:33,492
SAM: For two satchels like this, why don't we say
300?

2190
02:34:33,492 --> 02:34:43,728
MATT: His immediate eager lean forward slips back
into an arms-crossed. "400 was already a discount."

2191
02:34:43,728 --> 02:34:49,070
SAM: Fair enough. 400 it is.

2192
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:55,426
MATT: "400." He takes the other satchel and is
about to push it forward and is seemingly waiting.

2193
02:34:55,426 --> 02:35:02,277
SAM: For me to pay him? Sure, I'll drop four
hundred large.

2194
02:35:02,277 --> 02:35:03,540
MATT: Okay.

2195
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:05,526
SAM: Four hundred thousand dollars.

2196
02:35:05,526 --> 02:35:11,959
MATT: As you both wait a moment and pause, you
both shove it across at the same time, and he

2197
02:35:11,959 --> 02:35:17,884
catches the coin pouch after watching you count it
across the table. Both your satchels are at your

2198
02:35:17,884 --> 02:35:24,088
disposal. He goes, "It has been a pleasure doing
business with you. If it's not too much to ask, in

2199
02:35:24,088 --> 02:35:33,544
"case you require further assistance, what shall I
call you?"

2200
02:35:33,544 --> 02:35:36,954
SAM: You can call me The Meat Man.

2201
02:35:36,954 --> 02:35:40,694
(snorting and giggling)

2202
02:35:40,694 --> 02:35:46,705
MATT: "The Meat Man. I hope to do more business
with you in the future, Meat Man."

2203
02:35:46,705 --> 02:35:48,806
SAM: And what shall I call you?

2204
02:35:48,806 --> 02:35:57,202
MATT: "I have a few titles, but in these circles,
you may call me Rutur."

2205
02:35:57,202 --> 02:35:58,654
SAM: Rutur?

2206
02:35:58,654 --> 02:35:59,866
MATT: "Rutur."

2207
02:35:59,866 --> 02:36:05,610
SAM: Rutur. And so I'm clear here, this is a drug,
right?

2208
02:36:05,610 --> 02:36:08,257
MATT: "Of course it is."

2209
02:36:08,257 --> 02:36:15,048
SAM: Oh! Really? I'm not feeling it yet, do I need
to do more of it, is that the thing?

2210
02:36:15,048 --> 02:36:17,450
MATT: "It does not affect you immediately."

2211
02:36:17,450 --> 02:36:19,145
SAM: Oh. It doesn't?

2212
02:36:19,145 --> 02:36:21,222
ALL: Oh, shit.

2213
02:36:21,222 --> 02:36:23,046
SAM: All right, great, thanks, bye!

2214
02:36:23,046 --> 02:36:28,160
MATT: He takes his coin, gets up, walks around the
table, knocks on the door, a couple knocks. It

2215
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:33,494
opens, the half-elf peers through. The door opens
completely. He stops as you say that.

2216
02:36:33,494 --> 02:36:39,617
SAM: Sorry. I've got two big bags of drugs. Could
you give me a backpack or something to put this

2217
02:36:39,617 --> 02:36:42,950
in? I mean, I can't walk out of the casino holding
this.

2218
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:50,204
MATT: The half-orc rolls his eyes, looks over to
the half-elf and goes, (speaking Marquesian). The

2219
02:36:50,204 --> 02:36:56,729
other one turns. (sighs) "I'll be right back." And
he goes to one of the other rooms. In 30 seconds,

2220
02:36:56,729 --> 02:37:02,489
he comes back with some sort of a backpack-type
ensemble and tosses it to you. You catch it. "Now,

2221
02:37:02,489 --> 02:37:09,442
"should you need more, just ask around the bazaar."
And they both quickly head down the stairs past you.

2222
02:37:09,442 --> 02:37:15,198
SAM: As they go, I say to them, remember, we met,
but you did not meet the Meat Man.

2223
02:37:15,198 --> 02:37:25,298
MATT: They both stop on their step and look at
each other and keep walking. They exit the casino

2224
02:37:25,298 --> 02:37:27,121
and you have your satchel.

2225
02:37:27,121 --> 02:37:34,249
SAM: Okay. (breathing heavily) I hyperventilate
for a second. I don't know what's going on. Where

2226
02:37:34,249 --> 02:37:36,094
are you guys? Where are you guys?

2227
02:37:36,094 --> 02:37:39,050
LIAM: I place my hand right on his shoulder.

2228
02:37:39,050 --> 02:37:43,403
SAM: (yells in surprise) It's not me, it's not,
they're not mine! And I throw it across the room.

2229
02:37:43,403 --> 02:37:49,667
LIAM: I catch it! Grab him by the scruff of the
shirt and start leading him back down the stairs.

2230
02:37:49,667 --> 02:37:51,394
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2231
02:37:51,394 --> 02:37:54,485
SAM: Don't say anything. I've got lots of drugs.

2232
02:37:54,485 --> 02:37:57,097
LIAM: Why are your eyes all bloodshot? What's
the matter with you?

2233
02:37:57,097 --> 02:37:58,846
SAM: I don't know what I did.

2234
02:37:58,846 --> 02:38:00,050
LIAM: Is it this?

2235
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:02,186
SAM: Maybe! It hasn't affected me yet!

2236
02:38:02,186 --> 02:38:04,566
TALIESIN: No! No! What are you doing?

2237
02:38:04,566 --> 02:38:07,930
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

2238
02:38:07,930 --> 02:38:11,592
LAURA: Oh, you rolled really well.

2239
02:38:11,592 --> 02:38:13,274
LIAM: I rolled good, yeah, 19.

2240
02:38:13,274 --> 02:38:15,661
MATT: Seemingly no effect, little bit of numbness
in the gum where you placed it.

2241
02:38:15,661 --> 02:38:16,771
LIAM: That tastes terrible.

2242
02:38:16,771 --> 02:38:18,285
SAM: I know! I don't know what it's supposed to
do!

2243
02:38:18,285 --> 02:38:19,253
LIAM: Do I do more?

2244
02:38:19,253 --> 02:38:20,338
SAM: I think so!

2245
02:38:20,338 --> 02:38:23,004
MATT: As time passes, the after flavor does get
better, actually, surprisingly.

2246
02:38:23,004 --> 02:38:24,236
LIAM: That's good. Maybe I'll do more.

2247
02:38:24,236 --> 02:38:25,626
SAM: Yeah, just one more.

2248
02:38:25,626 --> 02:38:27,240
MATT: (chuckling) Make another constitution saving
throw.

2249
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:28,525
LIAM: Aw, 15.

2250
02:38:28,525 --> 02:38:31,445
MATT: Aftertaste is quite nice.

2251
02:38:31,445 --> 02:38:34,776
LIAM: I've wanted to get high with you for so
long! This is so cool!

2252
02:38:34,776 --> 02:38:36,226
SAM: One more.

2253
02:38:36,226 --> 02:38:42,810
LIAM: You're right. We're in a casino, life is so
fucking hard these days, why not? Both of us

2254
02:38:42,810 --> 02:38:43,670
together, right?

2255
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:44,562
SAM: Yeah!

2256
02:38:44,562 --> 02:38:45,900
LIAM: All right, here we go.

2257
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:47,506
MATT: You guys make a constitution saving throw.

2258
02:38:47,506 --> 02:38:48,639
LIAM: Two.

2259
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:49,706
SAM: 13.

2260
02:38:49,706 --> 02:38:51,178
TRAVIS: Chew on it.

2261
02:38:51,178 --> 02:38:53,027
MATT: The aftertaste is nice.

2262
02:38:53,027 --> 02:38:54,564
LAURA: It's a spice.

2263
02:38:54,564 --> 02:38:55,690
TRAVIS: Chew on it!

2264
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:56,865
LIAM: This is so boring.

2265
02:38:56,865 --> 02:38:59,853
SAM: We'll talk to some locals and figure out how
we're really supposed to do it.

2266
02:38:59,853 --> 02:39:02,960
LIAM: I'm going to get Kiki some fucking elven
wine. Come on. And I yank him down the stairs.

2267
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:06,479
TALIESIN: We've already been waiting in line for
the most colorful, ridiculous drink that we can

2268
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:09,612
get. Something with whatever's the local version
of an umbrella.

2269
02:39:09,612 --> 02:39:15,329
MATT: For the cost of two gold pieces amongst the
three of you, or four of you, if you're a part of

2270
02:39:15,329 --> 02:39:17,166
this as well, Grog--

2271
02:39:17,230 --> 02:39:19,062
MARISHA: The slushy margaritas.

2272
02:39:19,062 --> 02:39:20,875
TRAVIS: No, I'm hitting on ladies.

2273
02:39:20,875 --> 02:39:22,631
SAM: Yeah!

2274
02:39:22,631 --> 02:39:30,913
MATT: With a simple shoulder tap and an
introduction, they turn with a smile and stare

2275
02:39:30,913 --> 02:39:35,583
directly into the rhino-like helmet on your
forehead, seem confused, and lose interest very

2276
02:39:35,583 --> 02:39:37,062
quickly.

2277
02:39:37,062 --> 02:39:48,842
TRAVIS: You clearly do not know how rich I am as
the Countess of Febreze. I own many magnificent

2278
02:39:48,842 --> 02:39:50,394
horses.

2279
02:39:50,394 --> 02:39:52,351
MATT: Make a deception check.

2280
02:39:52,351 --> 02:39:56,873
TRAVIS: 15.

2281
02:39:56,873 --> 02:40:05,971
MATT: Now, the third woman you've come across in
here turns around. She's maybe early forties,

2282
02:40:05,971 --> 02:40:14,034
graying sides to her hair, pulled up tight, but
impeccable makeup, beautiful jeweled earrings. She

2283
02:40:14,034 --> 02:40:20,398
turns and gives you a glance. "Oh, well, my
apologies for not recognizing greatness in my

2284
02:40:20,398 --> 02:40:25,396
"presence. So why do you bother me?"

2285
02:40:25,396 --> 02:40:32,568
TRAVIS: Well, I am looking for a companion for the
evening. I've had a great victory and I was hoping

2286
02:40:32,568 --> 02:40:36,965
I might celebrate it with a fine lass like
yourself.

2287
02:40:36,965 --> 02:40:47,503
MATT: "I do not mean to blush in the presence of
such greatness, ha. I need to speak to my

2288
02:40:47,503 --> 02:40:59,734
"compatriot first. Honey?" And this gentleman turns
around, in fairly nice attire, dark blacks,

2289
02:40:59,734 --> 02:41:10,590
jeweled necklaces, dark skin, square jaw, rather
well-built, a human. Turns and goes, "Yes, my

2290
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:17,398
"dear?" "This fine fellow here is asking to spend
the night with me, if that's all right with you."

2291
02:41:17,398 --> 02:41:22,042
And he goes, (chuckles) "What, this one?"

2292
02:41:22,042 --> 02:41:37,646
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, I am the magister of Sh'breeze,
and I have many steeds. A night with me would

2293
02:41:37,646 --> 02:41:42,571
truly honor your lady fair.

2294
02:41:42,571 --> 02:41:50,627
MATT: They both share a glance and look back at
you, and he goes, "Piss off, half-born putz."

2295
02:41:50,627 --> 02:41:53,133
LAURA: Oh, shit.

2296
02:41:53,133 --> 02:41:56,832
MATT: "Piss off." And he takes her arm by his side
and pulls her close to him.

2297
02:41:56,832 --> 02:42:02,014
TRAVIS: I reach out and I grab his
shoulder. I say: I'm so sorry, this amazing

2298
02:42:02,014 --> 02:42:09,474
decorative piece on my head sometimes impedes my
hearing. I take the hat off. What was it you

2299
02:42:09,474 --> 02:42:11,060
called me?

2300
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:12,587
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2301
02:42:12,587 --> 02:42:15,057
MARISHA: Oh shit! Casino fight!

2302
02:42:15,057 --> 02:42:16,619
LAURA: Oh no!

2303
02:42:16,619 --> 02:42:19,459
SAM: Two people thrown out of the club!

2304
02:42:19,459 --> 02:42:26,638
MARISHA: Let's all get thrown out! Yeah! Natural one
buddies! Grog and Keyleth, on fire tonight!

2305
02:42:26,638 --> 02:42:33,111
MATT: As you lean in, he leans back and goes, "Oh,
well, I'm sorry, I did not realize that was not

2306
02:42:33,111 --> 02:42:42,090
"part of your actual forehead." You feel, now,
several hands meet your shoulders as it appears

2307
02:42:42,090 --> 02:42:49,778
about five of the various guards of the
establishment have encircled you, grabbed you, and

2308
02:42:49,778 --> 02:42:51,506
are now pulling you away from the group.

2309
02:42:51,506 --> 02:42:54,979
TRAVIS: Oh, I asked for a woman, not dudes, no
really, I just wanted one lady.

2310
02:42:54,979 --> 02:42:58,970
MATT: They're grabbing you by the arms, now, and
they're pulling you toward the entrance.

2311
02:42:58,970 --> 02:43:03,117
TRAVIS: Now, I'm not going to pay for this,
really, I'm not. I'm very important!

2312
02:43:03,117 --> 02:43:07,174
MATT: And it takes all five of them, but they do
manage to (grunt) heave-ho you out onto your face

2313
02:43:07,174 --> 02:43:11,623
across the cobblestones, where Keyleth is there
waiting, watching this happen.

2314
02:43:11,623 --> 02:43:13,081
MARISHA: Grog!

2315
02:43:13,081 --> 02:43:14,411
TRAVIS: Kiki!

2316
02:43:14,411 --> 02:43:15,376
MARISHA: Hey buddy!

2317
02:43:15,376 --> 02:43:16,814
TALIESIN: Are we at the bar?

2318
02:43:16,814 --> 02:43:19,531
MATT: You guys have just gotten your drinks, which
are --

2319
02:43:19,531 --> 02:43:26,516
TALIESIN: Do they have to-go cups? We'll take
four. Just one of every color. Just one of every

2320
02:43:26,516 --> 02:43:27,606
color.

2321
02:43:27,606 --> 02:43:37,531
MATT: The guy at the front goes, "Well, certainly.
That would be an additional gold piece per drink."

2322
02:43:37,531 --> 02:43:40,034
MARISHA: Percy, get me the flashy cup!

2323
02:43:40,034 --> 02:43:42,468
LAURA: I'm going to down mine really fast and then
take another one to go, thanks.

2324
02:43:42,468 --> 02:43:45,226
TALIESIN: I'll put down for the four cups.

2325
02:43:45,226 --> 02:43:47,692
MARISHA: I want the one that's in the shape of the
tower of Ord.

2326
02:43:47,692 --> 02:43:50,021
MATT: "Six gold, please."

2327
02:43:50,021 --> 02:43:51,680
SAM: That's a yard glass.

2328
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,614
MATT: All right, you have your drinks.

2329
02:43:53,614 --> 02:43:56,791
TALIESIN: I take them outside and begin
distributing them.

2330
02:43:56,791 --> 02:43:59,629
MATT: The cups themselves probably cost about
three copper each.

2331
02:43:59,629 --> 02:44:02,480
TALIESIN: God I hope so. It's about the memory.

2332
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:09,005
MATT: You all are a bunch of out-of-towners being
taken for a ride by every one of these patrons who

2333
02:44:09,005 --> 02:44:10,217
comes across you.

2334
02:44:10,217 --> 02:44:13,730
LIAM: This is so much fusaka. What is Jarett or
anybody going to do with this?

2335
02:44:13,730 --> 02:44:15,456
LAURA: Let's go back to the rooms.

2336
02:44:15,456 --> 02:44:19,250
SAM: We need to find out if it's real. Should we
go back and ask those guys who sold this to me?

2337
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:21,788
LIAM: I took three hits of this, and it has done
nothing.

2338
02:44:21,788 --> 02:44:26,708
LAURA: Come on, let's go back to the room and do
some experiments on it. Yes? Grog?

2339
02:44:26,708 --> 02:44:28,800
TRAVIS: Thank you. (belches)

2340
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,376
MARISHA: Did you guys bring me a drink?

2341
02:44:31,376 --> 02:44:35,418
TALIESIN: We did, yep, there's that. I give her
the most colorful, most ridiculous thing I can

2342
02:44:35,418 --> 02:44:36,765
find, in the most ridiculous cup they have.

2343
02:44:36,765 --> 02:44:39,717
LAURA: We head back to the hotel, to the inn.

2344
02:44:39,717 --> 02:44:41,365
MARISHA: (giggling) I love this city!

2345
02:44:41,365 --> 02:44:45,672
MATT: So you head back to the Debt's Respite, you
go back to your respective rooms, finish your

2346
02:44:45,672 --> 02:44:56,649
drinks along the way. You have your Luck's Run
collectible to-go cups that you bought off the

2347
02:44:56,649 --> 02:44:59,623
barkeep because, sure.

2348
02:44:59,623 --> 02:45:03,580
TALIESIN: It's not like I've never bought a
ridiculous plastic dragon necklace with the

2349
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:05,611
flashing LEDs before.

2350
02:45:05,611 --> 02:45:09,662
LIAM: I disappointedly drop the backpack in
Scanlan's lap and say: Here's your fucking

2351
02:45:09,662 --> 02:45:10,931
cinnamon, you idiot.

2352
02:45:10,931 --> 02:45:12,787
SAM: Are you sure it's not real?

2353
02:45:12,787 --> 02:45:15,205
MARISHA: What'd you guys get? What's it look
like?

2354
02:45:15,205 --> 02:45:20,016
SAM: It looks like nothing. Hey, can you nature
check this? You're a nature person.

2355
02:45:20,016 --> 02:45:21,623
MARISHA: I can try.

2356
02:45:21,623 --> 02:45:22,646
MATT: Yeah, make a nature check.

2357
02:45:22,646 --> 02:45:24,214
LAURA: Let's set it on fire and see what happens.

2358
02:45:24,214 --> 02:45:26,439
MARISHA: Okay, but first I'm going to nature check
it.

2359
02:45:26,439 --> 02:45:29,959
TALIESIN: The phrase "Let's set it on fire and see
what happens" usually doesn't work out well.

2360
02:45:29,959 --> 02:45:31,229
TRAVIS: That's a good idea.

2361
02:45:31,229 --> 02:45:32,726
LAURA: It looks like wood.

2362
02:45:32,726 --> 02:45:35,719
MARISHA: 14.

2363
02:45:35,719 --> 02:45:45,006
MATT: 14. I mean, it resembles a few things in
your past that you've come across, when cut down

2364
02:45:45,006 --> 02:45:48,707
and processed, but you're not familiar with this
one, unfortunately.

2365
02:45:48,707 --> 02:45:50,841
MARISHA: But it does seem plant-based?

2366
02:45:50,841 --> 02:45:54,659
MATT: Yeah, it is definitely natural.

2367
02:45:54,659 --> 02:45:57,043
MARISHA: I take a little finger-dippie.

2368
02:45:57,043 --> 02:45:59,060
TRAVIS: What are you doing with it?

2369
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:04,592
MATT: There's a brief bit of numbness that comes
to your gums. The flavor is awful, and then it

2370
02:46:04,592 --> 02:46:11,279
fades into a pleasant, smoky flavor.

2371
02:46:11,279 --> 02:46:13,696
LAURA: Does it taste like it would be good on a
sandwich?

2372
02:46:13,696 --> 02:46:15,725
MARISHA: It'd be great on a rack of lamb.

2373
02:46:15,725 --> 02:46:17,998
TRAVIS: Are you high?

2374
02:46:17,998 --> 02:46:19,743
MARISHA: Am I high?

2375
02:46:19,743 --> 02:46:21,318
MATT: Make a constitution check.

2376
02:46:21,318 --> 02:46:24,955
LIAM: It's got to be a natural one.

2377
02:46:24,955 --> 02:46:26,676
MATT: Constitution saving throw, at least.

2378
02:46:26,676 --> 02:46:28,502
MARISHA: Saving throw? 19.

2379
02:46:28,502 --> 02:46:30,585
MATT: 19. You seem to be fine.

2380
02:46:30,585 --> 02:46:36,654
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck it. I take a big old wad out of
the thing and I stick a big old chunk in my lip.

2381
02:46:36,654 --> 02:46:40,368
TALIESIN: Only because everybody's being an idiot,
can I recommend that we perhaps try grinding it up

2382
02:46:40,368 --> 02:46:42,369
into a tea, or something?

2383
02:46:42,369 --> 02:46:46,431
TRAVIS: 16.

2384
02:46:46,431 --> 02:46:48,031
SAM: He's fine.

2385
02:46:48,031 --> 02:46:56,585
MATT: I mean, the initial taste is not bad. You've
eaten far worse. And the lingering flavor is quite

2386
02:46:56,585 --> 02:46:57,886
delicious.

2387
02:46:57,886 --> 02:47:00,026
TRAVIS: This is really nice. Should I swallow it?

2388
02:47:00,026 --> 02:47:02,228
SAM: Yeah, I guess.

2389
02:47:02,228 --> 02:47:04,368
LAURA: I don't know, Grog.

2390
02:47:04,368 --> 02:47:05,813
TRAVIS: All right, I swallow it.

2391
02:47:05,813 --> 02:47:15,287
MATT: (gulping sound) No effect. A few minutes go
by, your stomach gets a little upset, but then it

2392
02:47:15,287 --> 02:47:18,834
passes. Yeah, a little bit, but then it passes.

2393
02:47:18,834 --> 02:47:25,020
MARISHA: I take a little bit in my hands and I
light it with my flame hands to see what happens.

2394
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:26,281
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2395
02:47:26,281 --> 02:47:32,082
MATT: Okay. The flame takes it, leaving behind
this burning ember. The smoke emanates off of it.

2396
02:47:32,082 --> 02:47:36,525
It gives this little plume of grayish brown.

2397
02:47:36,525 --> 02:47:39,579
MARISHA: I waft it a little bit.

2398
02:47:39,579 --> 02:47:41,355
MATT: Smells really nice.

2399
02:47:41,355 --> 02:47:44,775
LIAM: It is hilarious how badly we all want this
to be heroin, and it's not.

2400
02:47:44,775 --> 02:47:48,411
TRAVIS: Can we free-base this shit?

2401
02:47:48,411 --> 02:47:52,744
MATT: It smells like a very fancy kitchen.

2402
02:47:52,744 --> 02:47:56,721
LAURA: Can I walk downstairs and find the
innkeeper?

2403
02:47:56,721 --> 02:47:58,905
MATT: Yeah, yeah. As you head downstairs --

2404
02:47:58,905 --> 02:48:02,968
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a little bit, I'm
going to mortar and pestle a little bit, and make

2405
02:48:02,968 --> 02:48:04,360
a tea.

2406
02:48:04,360 --> 02:48:07,460
MATT: Eventually you find Treev is down there,
watching over the counter.

2407
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:12,596
LAURA: Hey, Treev. Hi.

2408
02:48:12,596 --> 02:48:14,478
MATT: "Oi, hi, how do you do."

2409
02:48:14,478 --> 02:48:18,538
LAURA: I'm looking for a meal. I'm a little
homesick. I'm hoping you have a meal that

2410
02:48:18,538 --> 02:48:20,176
maybe has some fusaka in it?

2411
02:48:20,176 --> 02:48:25,474
MATT: "Oh, we got a bit over here. It's a bit
pricey."

2412
02:48:25,474 --> 02:48:27,920
LAURA: Oh, it is a pricey spice, yeah.

2413
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:31,182
MATT: "A bit, at least, for what it's worth. You
only want to use bits and pieces in the meats."

2414
02:48:31,182 --> 02:48:32,574
LAURA: Right.

2415
02:48:32,574 --> 02:48:34,354
MATT: "Use too much and it spoils the flavor."

2416
02:48:34,354 --> 02:48:39,801
LAURA: Of course. It wouldn't do anything to your
body if you had too much of it, would it?

2417
02:48:39,801 --> 02:48:41,985
MATT: "You'd probably get sick a bit, I imagine."

2418
02:48:41,985 --> 02:48:43,231
LAURA: Probably. Right.

2419
02:48:43,231 --> 02:48:46,038
SAM: I'm upstairs trying to take it anally.

2420
02:48:46,038 --> 02:48:51,438
(laughter)

2421
02:48:51,438 --> 02:48:54,515
SAM: Come on, this'll work! This will work!

2422
02:48:54,515 --> 02:48:56,645
TRAVIS: Trainspotting. This is Trainspotting.

2423
02:48:56,645 --> 02:49:01,724
LAURA: Tell you what, I'm going to save the money.
I think I'll hold off on the fusaka for tonight,

2424
02:49:01,724 --> 02:49:04,290
but maybe later. Thank you.

2425
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:07,375
TALIESIN: I've ground and powdered a tea, and
placed it in the room and walked away.

2426
02:49:07,375 --> 02:49:10,832
LIAM: I'm sorry to say that I am watching Scanlan,
fascinated.

2427
02:49:10,832 --> 02:49:15,190
TALIESIN: I'm not. My head is turned around. I'm
sketching things.

2428
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:21,862
SAM: No one lies to the Meat Man. I want to go
back to that place and get my revenge. Are you

2429
02:49:21,862 --> 02:49:23,418
with me, Vax?

2430
02:49:23,418 --> 02:49:25,042
LIAM: Vex, Vax? Which of us?

2431
02:49:25,042 --> 02:49:26,107
SAM: Vax!

2432
02:49:26,107 --> 02:49:27,990
LIAM: Yeah, sure, buddy.

2433
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:31,994
MARISHA: Why do you need revenge? You got the
product you bought, right?

2434
02:49:31,994 --> 02:49:33,280
TRAVIS: How's your butt feeling?

2435
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:35,841
SAM: It feels a little tingly, but overall just
fine.

2436
02:49:35,841 --> 02:49:38,124
MATT: It does itch.

2437
02:49:38,124 --> 02:49:41,849
TALIESIN: Does he have to make another
constitution check at this point?

2438
02:49:41,849 --> 02:49:46,411
MATT: No, you've pretty much figured out at this
point that it is just a flavoring spice.

2439
02:49:46,411 --> 02:49:51,005
LAURA: Here's the thing, he said it's an expensive
spice. Maybe it was worth however much you spent

2440
02:49:51,005 --> 02:49:52,950
on it. Tell me how much you spent on this.

2441
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:54,205
SAM: Like, 50.

2442
02:49:54,205 --> 02:49:56,511
LAURA: Oh, 50 gold, that's a lot, but I think it
should be fine.

2443
02:49:56,511 --> 02:49:58,676
TALIESIN: You spent 50 gold on this? Good god!

2444
02:49:58,676 --> 02:50:04,265
(laughter)

2445
02:50:04,265 --> 02:50:07,651
LAURA: You can make 50 gold back betting in the
casino later.

2446
02:50:07,651 --> 02:50:10,909
TALIESIN: It was 50 gold as a fine lesson, though.
Real worth it.

2447
02:50:10,909 --> 02:50:14,737
LIAM: If you <i>really</i> want to go get revenge, I
will get revenge with you, but I think we should

2448
02:50:14,737 --> 02:50:19,899
call it a loss. 50 gold is a piddly thing. Is that
a word? No.

2449
02:50:19,899 --> 02:50:26,558
TALIESIN: If it were any more, I'd feel bad, but
it's only 50 gold. I'd feel like an idiot.

2450
02:50:26,558 --> 02:50:29,850
LIAM: You are upset.

2451
02:50:29,850 --> 02:50:32,708
TALIESIN: I think he's just had too much spice.

2452
02:50:32,708 --> 02:50:35,752
TRAVIS: He's foreseeing the Washington Redskins
season.

2453
02:50:35,752 --> 02:50:39,230
LAURA: They said it could make your stomach upset
if you've had too much. Have you had too much?

2454
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:41,879
SAM: He lied to me.

2455
02:50:41,879 --> 02:50:44,432
LIAM: Let me get you a drink. You want me to go
down and get you a drink?

2456
02:50:44,432 --> 02:50:46,324
SAM: Don't spend any money on it.

2457
02:50:46,324 --> 02:50:52,798
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. I'm going to get
a little bit of the wine, of the ridiculous wine

2458
02:50:52,798 --> 02:51:00,141
that we got. I'm going to pour a little bit into
my new collector cup that I got, and I'm going to

2459
02:51:00,141 --> 02:51:02,517
sprinkle it with some of the powdered spice.

2460
02:51:02,517 --> 02:51:03,905
SAM: Maybe it has to activate that way!

2461
02:51:03,905 --> 02:51:06,560
TALIESIN: Here, there you are! Down that, that'll
go quite well.

2462
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:08,216
LAURA: Oh, he drank the whole thing!

2463
02:51:08,216 --> 02:51:14,810
MATT: Those flavors didn't mingle too well. You
feel a little queasy.

2464
02:51:14,810 --> 02:51:16,713
LAURA: Is that the wine that was like--

2465
02:51:16,713 --> 02:51:17,640
TRAVIS: Yes.

2466
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:18,759
LAURA: Grog's wine?

2467
02:51:18,759 --> 02:51:20,466
MATT: Oh wait. Oh, this was the sandkheg?

2468
02:51:20,466 --> 02:51:21,915
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a little bit of the
sandkheg.

2469
02:51:21,915 --> 02:51:26,505
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

2470
02:51:26,505 --> 02:51:28,556
SAM: 17.

2471
02:51:28,556 --> 02:51:41,740
MATT: 17, okay. Beneath your nose, you can't feel
anything. And right now, yeah, from here down. You

2472
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:44,991
guys watch as his tongue is hanging out, and you
watch as drool is now pouring down the side of his chin.

2473
02:51:44,991 --> 02:51:46,143
LAURA: Scanlan?

2474
02:51:46,143 --> 02:51:48,349
SAM: (thickly) Huh? That's good shit.

2475
02:51:48,349 --> 02:51:56,523
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently try and take
the gold medal that he got today away from him

2476
02:51:56,523 --> 02:51:59,668
while he's numb. Just try and pickpocket him.

2477
02:51:59,668 --> 02:52:00,913
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

2478
02:52:00,913 --> 02:52:02,006
TALIESIN: Okay.

2479
02:52:02,006 --> 02:52:05,377
SAM: (more inarticulate noises)

2480
02:52:05,377 --> 02:52:09,528
MARISHA: Oh my god. It's the night of all the
natural ones.

2481
02:52:09,528 --> 02:52:10,849
LAURA: Oh no.

2482
02:52:10,849 --> 02:52:15,056
MATT: Heh. Out of the corner of your eye, you see
Percy pulling a shiny object from around your

2483
02:52:15,056 --> 02:52:16,365
shoulders.

2484
02:52:16,365 --> 02:52:20,740
TALIESIN: Ugh! No slapping! No, don't slap!

2485
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:30,378
LIAM: I walk over to Scanlan and I squat down and
I start play-doh'ing his face in all different

2486
02:52:30,378 --> 02:52:35,695
shapes, pulling the cheeks out really wide,
pulling the nose up as--

2487
02:52:35,695 --> 02:52:36,962
LAURA: We should get him to bed.

2488
02:52:36,962 --> 02:52:38,272
LIAM: If only I had scotch tape.

2489
02:52:38,272 --> 02:52:45,004
TRAVIS: So like, should we sleep? Because I know
we still wanted to see Headmaster James Kryon at

2490
02:52:45,004 --> 02:52:46,483
the Crystal Chateau.

2491
02:52:46,483 --> 02:52:49,081
TALIESIN: Yes, let's get an evening's sleep.

2492
02:52:49,081 --> 02:52:51,022
LIAM: Yeah, and we need to fix Scanlan before--

2493
02:52:51,022 --> 02:52:55,965
TRAVIS: Maybe he needs to be slapped sober.

2494
02:52:55,965 --> 02:53:08,279
LAURA: We're still waiting to hear back on
Mistress Asharru?

2495
02:53:08,279 --> 02:53:09,909
TALIESIN: Yes, we are still waiting on that.

2496
02:53:09,909 --> 02:53:11,581
LAURA: Yes. So we can't leave here.

2497
02:53:11,581 --> 02:53:13,336
TRAVIS: Mister Ashad?

2498
02:53:13,336 --> 02:53:14,702
LAURA: The one with the cloak.

2499
02:53:14,702 --> 02:53:18,546
TALIESIN: And we have several magical items that
could use a little bit of jiggery-pokery, so let's

2500
02:53:18,546 --> 02:53:31,958
sleep this off, perhaps, and be excited that we're
bringing a friend a taste of home at the bargain

2501
02:53:31,958 --> 02:53:33,593
of 50 gold.

2502
02:53:33,593 --> 02:53:38,558
LAURA: But I have to say, I'm glad Jarett didn't
send us on a mission to get drugs. It's quite out

2503
02:53:38,558 --> 02:53:39,589
of character.

2504
02:53:39,589 --> 02:53:41,362
TALIESIN: I mean, you know.

2505
02:53:41,362 --> 02:53:43,343
SAM: (inarticulate noise)

2506
02:53:43,343 --> 02:53:45,830
LIAM: I've got my pinkies in the sides of
Scanlan's mouth.

2507
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:51,574
LAURA: Leave him alone. He's pathetic enough as it
is, really.

2508
02:53:51,574 --> 02:53:53,394
SAM: (sobbing)

2509
02:53:53,394 --> 02:53:56,644
TRAVIS: All right, I'm going to bed.

2510
02:53:56,644 --> 02:53:57,684
LAURA: Yeah.

2511
02:53:57,684 --> 02:54:00,027
MATT: All right, you guys find yourselves to your
respective rooms.

2512
02:54:00,027 --> 02:54:02,097
SAM: (thickly) Be pleased.

2513
02:54:02,097 --> 02:54:08,964
MATT: You all have a full night's rest, back to
full hit points. You get half your maximum hit

2514
02:54:08,964 --> 02:54:19,229
dice back if you've spent any more than half of
them. Scanlan, you wake up, quite a pounding

2515
02:54:19,229 --> 02:54:22,340
headache in your head, but the rest of your body
has its feeling back as you come to

2516
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:24,064
consciousness.

2517
02:54:24,064 --> 02:54:31,577
SAM: Maybe I can package it into smaller amounts
and sell it on the street to recoup some of the

2518
02:54:31,577 --> 02:54:36,354
money. Do we have an afternoon to kill?

2519
02:54:36,354 --> 02:54:38,195
TRAVIS: Are you talking to yourself?

2520
02:54:38,195 --> 02:54:51,166
SAM: Yes. Damn it, what did I do? I should have
insight checked him, or I could've dominated,

2521
02:54:51,166 --> 02:54:58,681
there are so many things I could have done to him
to find out! I flew too close to the sun.

2522
02:54:58,681 --> 02:55:07,030
(laughter)

2523
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:16,281
SAM: (sighs) Next time. Next time I'll do things
differently. Next time I will find drugs. That's

2524
02:55:16,281 --> 02:55:22,143
the lesson to be taken from this, look harder.
Look harder. The Meat Man never gives up.

2525
02:55:22,143 --> 02:55:25,280
TALIESIN: I believe in you, Walter White. I
believe in you.

2526
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:33,882
MATT: And another persona of Scanlan was born. All
righty, so what are your plans for the day? As you

2527
02:55:33,882 --> 02:55:40,291
stumble down into the main tavern area, you can
see Treev's barely conscious himself and a few

2528
02:55:40,291 --> 02:55:47,530
other patrons are waiting eagerly for their food
as a few of the various barkeep assistants are

2529
02:55:47,530 --> 02:55:52,289
bringing out breakfasts and meals. "You'll want
food on your way out, then?"

2530
02:55:52,289 --> 02:55:53,846
LAURA: Yes, please.

2531
02:55:53,846 --> 02:55:59,058
TALIESIN: And whatever you have for a hangover for
our friend who'll be down in, oh, never quite

2532
02:55:59,058 --> 02:56:00,224
possibly.

2533
02:56:00,224 --> 02:56:01,415
MATT: "Hair of the dog, it is."

2534
02:56:01,415 --> 02:56:02,815
TALIESIN: I think he may have had the whole dog.

2535
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:07,608
TRAVIS: We thought we might be going to the
Crystal Chateau today. Anything to know about

2536
02:56:07,608 --> 02:56:08,782
heading that direction?

2537
02:56:08,782 --> 02:56:10,291
(cricket sounds)

2538
02:56:10,291 --> 02:56:11,663
TRAVIS: Crickets in this tavern.

2539
02:56:11,663 --> 02:56:16,465
MATT: "Ah, get rid of them. Well, other than the
fact that they're a bunch of stuffy folk and

2540
02:56:16,465 --> 02:56:26,904
"generally not really considered classic
traditional Ank'harel, I mean good luck getting a

2541
02:56:26,904 --> 02:56:28,192
"right answer out of anyone."

2542
02:56:28,192 --> 02:56:31,074
TRAVIS: They snobs? Or are they like shifty?

2543
02:56:31,074 --> 02:56:37,359
MATT: "Snobs of the highest order! At least from
what I've seen. Allegiance of All-Sight and all that."

2544
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:41,227
TALIESIN: I love snobs. I'm excited.

2545
02:56:41,227 --> 02:56:43,877
LAURA: Any word back from Mistress Asharru?

2546
02:56:43,877 --> 02:56:48,419
MATT: "Nope. No word. Who knows how long it'll
take. She might not even like it. You may never

2547
02:56:48,419 --> 02:56:53,434
"hear back from her. In which case, if you wait
long enough, I can see if I can hire someone else

2548
02:56:53,434 --> 02:56:54,484
"for you."

2549
02:56:54,484 --> 02:56:56,334
LAURA: Yeah, thank you.

2550
02:56:56,334 --> 02:57:01,704
TALIESIN: We have business, we can see to it.
Let's take everything that we need. We have

2551
02:57:01,704 --> 02:57:03,262
several objects, if I recall.

2552
02:57:03,262 --> 02:57:06,685
TRAVIS: Yep, shall we?

2553
02:57:06,685 --> 02:57:08,817
LAURA: Scarf down the breakfast!

2554
02:57:08,817 --> 02:57:11,479
MATT: You get your food in your system.

2555
02:57:11,479 --> 02:57:13,466
TALIESIN: We're going to actually need a Scanlan.

2556
02:57:13,466 --> 02:57:15,261
LAURA: How you doing, Scan?

2557
02:57:15,261 --> 02:57:25,461
SAM: I wander down, (sighs) good morning all! I
hope you slept nicely. My jaw seems to work! Thank

2558
02:57:25,461 --> 02:57:30,306
you for not nursing me at all last night, I
would've done the same to you.

2559
02:57:30,306 --> 02:57:33,112
TALIESIN: (loudly) How are you feeling?

2560
02:57:33,112 --> 02:57:34,414
SAM: Aw, fuck you!

2561
02:57:34,414 --> 02:57:44,007
(laughter)

2562
02:57:44,007 --> 02:57:49,659
LIAM: Aw, I feel so bad. I walk up behind him and
I start doing like a scalp massage, around the

2563
02:57:49,659 --> 02:57:52,938
temples. You'll be all right, eat something,
okay.

2564
02:57:52,938 --> 02:57:57,659
SAM: All right. Something with meat, I need to use
this spice.

2565
02:57:57,659 --> 02:58:02,058
MARISHA: I make a little bit of my glissfoil
hangover tonic. Give it to him.

2566
02:58:02,058 --> 02:58:06,913
MATT: It helps. The next 15 minutes or so of you
finishing your breakfast, the headache fades for

2567
02:58:06,913 --> 02:58:08,847
the most part. The pounding subsides.

2568
02:58:08,847 --> 02:58:15,471
SAM: The innkeeper knew of the spice, correct? Can I
talk to the innkeeper really quick?

2569
02:58:15,471 --> 02:58:19,855
MATT: Sure, you walk up to Treev, who's right now
sitting there reading a book, has like a rather

2570
02:58:19,855 --> 02:58:26,196
thick pair of glasses that look rather hilarious
against the small dragonborn eyes, focus against

2571
02:58:26,196 --> 02:58:28,373
the really rough and tumble exterior.

2572
02:58:28,373 --> 02:58:36,974
SAM: Oy, Treev? That fusaka spice, how much does
it go for usually for a bag? Big bag, sack?

2573
02:58:36,974 --> 02:58:39,983
MATT: "How big a bag are you talking?"

2574
02:58:39,983 --> 02:58:41,475
SAM: Hog's head, right?

2575
02:58:41,475 --> 02:58:42,683
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a hog's head.

2576
02:58:42,683 --> 02:58:48,225
MATT: "Hog's head bag. It depends on where you're
buying it. Ten gold?"

2577
02:58:48,225 --> 02:58:56,690
(groaning and laughter)

2578
02:58:56,690 --> 02:58:59,526
MATT: "But you could probably barter most down
from there, if you're getting it in bulk."

2579
02:58:59,526 --> 02:59:09,066
SAM: That hurts. I thought you people said it was
expensive?

2580
02:59:09,066 --> 02:59:15,775
MATT: "For spice, yeah! Mostly dealing with
coppers and silvers for mere poison food flavor."

2581
02:59:15,775 --> 02:59:21,825
SAM: What if it's really high quality fusaka?

2582
02:59:21,825 --> 02:59:29,683
MATT: "12? Fusaka's fusaka and you don't find many
folks that're asking for its flavor except for

2583
02:59:29,683 --> 02:59:36,464
"particular dishes, so I only keep maybe a small
flagon of it at any times. In fact, last night is

2584
02:59:36,464 --> 02:59:38,847
"the first time someone asked for it in about
three months."

2585
02:59:38,847 --> 02:59:41,120
LAURA: What does it normally look like?

2586
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:42,646
MARISHA: No one even fucking wants it!

2587
02:59:42,646 --> 02:59:44,403
LAURA: I mean when you're using it in food.

2588
02:59:44,403 --> 02:59:48,696
MATT: "Well, it comes--" and he goes through like
a small spice rack on the side of the kitchen,

2589
02:59:48,696 --> 02:59:54,343
comes back out and pulls out a small glass
container. He uncorks the top and inside you can

2590
02:59:54,343 --> 03:00:00,033
see it's a very fine dark brown powder. He says,
"It comes in bits but you grind it down and then

2591
03:00:00,033 --> 03:00:06,508
"you sprinkle it over, cook it proper, usually with
slow roasts, and it's quite nice."

2592
03:00:06,508 --> 03:00:09,678
SAM: Thanks, Treev.

2593
03:00:09,678 --> 03:00:11,230
MATT: "No worries."

2594
03:00:11,230 --> 03:00:15,787
SAM: All right, I'm good.

2595
03:00:15,787 --> 03:00:18,440
LIAM: Enjoy that allspice.

2596
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:20,881
SAM: Let's go on our journey.

2597
03:00:20,881 --> 03:00:23,216
TRAVIS: We buying more drugs today?

2598
03:00:23,216 --> 03:00:28,861
SAM: No, I think my kingpin days are over.

2599
03:00:28,861 --> 03:00:31,102
LIAM: That is sad to hear.

2600
03:00:31,102 --> 03:00:33,678
TRAVIS: Off to the Crystal Chateau, then?

2601
03:00:33,678 --> 03:00:35,053
TALIESIN: Off to the Crystal Chateau.

2602
03:00:35,053 --> 03:00:39,118
MATT: Who's leading the charge to the Crystal
Chateau?

2603
03:00:39,118 --> 03:00:44,775
MARISHA: We ask Treev first: where is the Crystal
Chateau?

2604
03:00:44,775 --> 03:00:59,529
MATT: He thinks for a second, "Ain't been around
those areas for a bit. Those'll be over in the

2605
03:00:59,529 --> 03:01:08,786
"Sigil District, and that's right down in the
southeastern side of Ank'harel. Look for the

2606
03:01:08,786 --> 03:01:13,683
"raised landmass where it's carved off at the top.
That's where most of all the bastards live and

2607
03:01:13,683 --> 03:01:17,791
"most of the training's done by the Allegiance
folk."

2608
03:01:17,791 --> 03:01:20,058
LIAM: The bastards live, you said?

2609
03:01:20,058 --> 03:01:21,783
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're snobby.

2610
03:01:21,783 --> 03:01:28,284
LAURA: Thank you.

2611
03:01:28,284 --> 03:01:30,471
MATT: "My pleasure."

2612
03:01:30,471 --> 03:01:31,911
TALIESIN: Be back in a bit.

2613
03:01:31,911 --> 03:01:33,279
TRAVIS: Meep-meep.

2614
03:01:33,279 --> 03:01:34,977
TALIESIN: I'll lead the charge.

2615
03:01:34,977 --> 03:01:37,599
MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

2616
03:01:37,599 --> 03:01:42,449
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god.

2617
03:01:42,449 --> 03:01:45,278
LAURA: Are you finding anything, Percy?

2618
03:01:45,278 --> 03:01:48,684
TALIESIN: No. Six.

2619
03:01:48,684 --> 03:01:51,284
MATT: Six. What'd you roll?

2620
03:01:51,284 --> 03:01:52,625
TALIESIN: Two.

2621
03:01:52,625 --> 03:01:59,182
MATT: At least it's not a one. It takes you about
four hours of wandering the city to finally get

2622
03:01:59,182 --> 03:02:06,689
the proper directions to lead you towards the
Sigil District to the Crystal Chateau. As you

2623
03:02:06,689 --> 03:02:09,998
ascend through these streets, the red cobblestone
that you've seen through most of the streets of

2624
03:02:09,998 --> 03:02:20,334
Ank'harel gives way to this slightly opalescent
surface where the light itself almost dances

2625
03:02:20,334 --> 03:02:26,481
across the surface of the stones. It shifts in the
outskirts of where the large hillside comes to an

2626
03:02:26,481 --> 03:02:35,713
end, and the buildings here give way to an open
space where you see a large, open square, but in

2627
03:02:35,713 --> 03:02:45,064
the center of the square, there are ropes around
some sort of large hole in the ground, probably a

2628
03:02:45,064 --> 03:02:55,626
good 150 feet across. It is a circular chasm off
to the eastern side of this large open square.

2629
03:02:55,626 --> 03:03:03,572
There are maybe a half dozen individuals standing
around the lip of it. A few of them are armed and

2630
03:03:03,572 --> 03:03:09,801
armored, and a few of them seem to be dressed in
long, relatively nice robes and light clothing.

2631
03:03:09,801 --> 03:03:27,965
You see a number of longhouses with high steepled
roofs with a yellowish-tan tint to them. These

2632
03:03:27,965 --> 03:03:34,590
buildings are very nice. They look constructed in
a type of architecture that's more reminiscent of

2633
03:03:34,590 --> 03:03:41,930
Tal'Dorei or other civilizations than you've seen
most of Ank'Harel's construction, so you figure

2634
03:03:41,930 --> 03:03:46,080
these buildings are probably newer or at least
this district seems to have a little different

2635
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:52,381
cultural flavor to it than the rest of the city.
To the southern side of it you do see a large

2636
03:03:52,381 --> 03:04:01,270
multi-tiered structure that is made of a smoky
quartz mixed with white marble in places. This,

2637
03:04:01,270 --> 03:04:04,730
with an immediate glance, you'd probably gather is
the Crystal Chateau.

2638
03:04:04,730 --> 03:04:10,372
TALIESIN: Does the opalescent stone have any
similarity to the stones of Whitestone?

2639
03:04:10,372 --> 03:04:14,111
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2640
03:04:14,111 --> 03:04:18,889
MARISHA: Don't use the opalite dice. Opalite hates
us.

2641
03:04:18,889 --> 03:04:22,970
TALIESIN: There we go. 23.

2642
03:04:22,970 --> 03:04:30,216
MATT: You take a moment, glance down closely, and
look at it. It looks like the cobblestones of this

2643
03:04:30,216 --> 03:04:34,246
particular district, and it's only really towards
the top of this hill, where all the rest of these

2644
03:04:34,246 --> 03:04:40,644
buildings are constructed, has a <i>very</i> faint
trace of ground-in whitestone particles that had

2645
03:04:40,644 --> 03:04:45,891
been part of the construct of these floors. A
large portion of whitestone, over time, has been

2646
03:04:45,891 --> 03:04:49,862
exported to this location for the construction of
the top of this hill.

2647
03:04:49,862 --> 03:04:51,242
TALIESIN: Good to know.

2648
03:04:51,242 --> 03:05:00,251
LAURA: Can I wander over to the big hole in the
ground and ask one of the guards: Oi! What's in there?

2649
03:05:00,251 --> 03:05:06,458
MATT: As soon as you walk up, two of the guards
give you a keen look and put their hands on the

2650
03:05:06,458 --> 03:05:09,410
sides of their sheathed weapons.

2651
03:05:09,410 --> 03:05:13,564
LAURA: No worries. I'm from out of town. I just
was very curious.

2652
03:05:13,564 --> 03:05:25,028
MATT: They look at each other and some of the
more-- for lack of a better term, more academic

2653
03:05:25,028 --> 03:05:30,199
looking individuals-- shy away from this seemingly
growing possible confrontation, from their

2654
03:05:30,199 --> 03:05:38,523
perspective. They begin to pull back and walk down
this slightly descending, spiral-like path, that's

2655
03:05:38,523 --> 03:05:44,474
about ten feet off the inside of this carving into
the floor. They begin to descend down into it. One

2656
03:05:44,474 --> 03:05:51,007
of the guards says, "This is where the Allegiance
is currently excavating."

2657
03:05:51,007 --> 03:05:58,632
LAURA: Oh. And the Allegiance is the people who
live here? No?

2658
03:05:58,632 --> 03:06:03,993
MATT: "The Allegiance runs all of the schools
here."

2659
03:06:03,993 --> 03:06:06,977
LAURA: Of course, yes, the schools for magic.

2660
03:06:06,977 --> 03:06:08,811
MATT: "You are not from here?"

2661
03:06:08,811 --> 03:06:10,057
LAURA: I am not, at all.

2662
03:06:10,057 --> 03:06:13,468
MATT: "Well, please be on your way."

2663
03:06:13,468 --> 03:06:18,952
LAURA: Right. Thank you for all of your helpfuw
information. Helpfuw? Helpful.

2664
03:06:18,952 --> 03:06:28,924
MATT: As you walk and turn away, they keep a close
eye as you step back into the open area of the square.

2665
03:06:28,924 --> 03:06:31,030
LAURA: There's a big hole in the ground.

2666
03:06:31,030 --> 03:06:32,582
TALIESIN: I was noticing. That's odd.

2667
03:06:32,582 --> 03:06:40,710
LAURA: They're esc-excavating something. I don't know
what's happening to my brain!

2668
03:06:40,710 --> 03:06:42,622
TALIESIN: Had a little bit of spice, have we?

2669
03:06:42,622 --> 03:06:56,033
MARISHA: Does it look like a similar excavation
site to the ziggurat in Whitestone?

2670
03:06:56,033 --> 03:07:03,831
MATT: The ziggurat is a subterranean chamber that
was found through a long series of tunnels that

2671
03:07:03,831 --> 03:07:10,408
were carved beneath a long swath of land,
underneath Whitestone Castle, to the actual city

2672
03:07:10,408 --> 03:07:16,411
of Whitestone. This appears to be just a large,
strip mine-like cylinder that descends deep into

2673
03:07:16,411 --> 03:07:20,160
the earth. You haven't been able to get close
enough to look down toward the bottom of it.

2674
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:21,656
TALIESIN: How wide again, approximately?

2675
03:07:21,656 --> 03:07:25,643
MATT: About 150 feet across. You're estimating
from this distance.

2676
03:07:25,643 --> 03:07:28,773
TALIESIN: And it looks excavated, and not just
like something opened up and then they kept

2677
03:07:28,773 --> 03:07:30,007
digging?

2678
03:07:30,007 --> 03:07:33,286
MATT: Correct. You can see there is actually a
pattern to the carving of the earth. It looks like

2679
03:07:33,286 --> 03:07:36,919
it's been carved in, layer after layer after
layer, much like a small-scale strip mine.

2680
03:07:36,919 --> 03:07:40,832
TALIESIN: Do the stones look like they broke the
ground, or does it look like the stones were

2681
03:07:40,832 --> 03:07:46,078
actually built around this? Has this been here
since the construction of this area? Or does it

2682
03:07:46,078 --> 03:07:50,094
seem like perhaps in the last 20 years or such,
they've just gone down?

2683
03:07:50,094 --> 03:07:53,253
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2684
03:07:53,253 --> 03:07:58,274
TALIESIN: No. It's a hole!

2685
03:07:58,274 --> 03:08:03,126
MATT: Yeah. It's hard to tell. For all your
training in Whitestone, you haven't really been

2686
03:08:03,126 --> 03:08:10,582
too keen on reading about the various details and
specifications behind paving roads.

2687
03:08:10,582 --> 03:08:14,400
MARISHA: Percy?

2688
03:08:14,400 --> 03:08:15,530
TALIESIN: Yes?

2689
03:08:15,530 --> 03:08:19,714
MARISHA: Is there whitestone located outside of
Whitestone?

2690
03:08:19,714 --> 03:08:32,065
TALIESIN: Not really, that I'm aware of. It rests
beneath the tree, in the hills, in the mines to

2691
03:08:32,065 --> 03:08:34,347
the north, and that's pretty much it that I'm
aware of.

2692
03:08:34,347 --> 03:08:37,369
LIAM: And you would know about any dealings that
Whitestone would have?

2693
03:08:37,369 --> 03:08:43,787
TALIESIN: Well, I would if I had paid attention to
such things, but it wasn't something that I was--

2694
03:08:43,787 --> 03:08:50,614
I was very young the last time I was there. I
don't really know where anything went, but I can

2695
03:08:50,614 --> 03:08:52,852
assume that this came from Whitestone.

2696
03:08:52,852 --> 03:08:55,300
TRAVIS: I bet they got this from Whitestone!

2697
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:58,522
LIAM: That's a bit of a stretch, Grog.

2698
03:08:58,522 --> 03:09:02,522
TALIESIN: This is interesting. How did you come to
that conclusion?

2699
03:09:02,522 --> 03:09:07,849
TRAVIS: I don't know, I just felt a little brain
snap and then things danced between my ears and

2700
03:09:07,849 --> 03:09:09,505
then it hit my mouth.

2701
03:09:09,505 --> 03:09:12,460
TALIESIN: You should write that down.

2702
03:09:12,460 --> 03:09:18,501
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little gold star for him
out of bark, and I say: Here you go, Grog! Good

2703
03:09:18,501 --> 03:09:20,651
job! You have a gold star for the day!

2704
03:09:20,651 --> 03:09:21,708
TRAVIS: What do I do with this?

2705
03:09:21,708 --> 03:09:23,996
MARISHA: Just stick it right on your forehead!

2706
03:09:23,996 --> 03:09:27,257
LIAM: Or eat it.

2707
03:09:27,257 --> 03:09:35,097
MATT: You hear a crunching between his pearly
white, larger-than-average goliath teeth.

2708
03:09:35,097 --> 03:09:40,575
TALIESIN: This is good news, if it is whitestone.
It means that we at least have some leverage here.

2709
03:09:40,575 --> 03:09:51,055
Let's find a big door, the biggest door we can
find, and attack it!

2710
03:09:51,055 --> 03:09:57,626
MATT: That's always worked out well for you guys
in the past. You make your way south of the square

2711
03:09:57,626 --> 03:10:03,863
to the Crystal Chateau. There is a large white
iron gate that surrounds the premises.

2712
03:10:03,863 --> 03:10:07,196
And from where the cobblestone 
ends beyond that gate

2713
03:10:07,196 --> 03:10:20,548
it is a fairly beautiful, well-kept, fenced-off
garden, where you see some trees popping up, green

2714
03:10:20,548 --> 03:10:27,086
grass. Looks to be a small stream that runs
through, there's a bridge off the main path that leads to

2715
03:10:27,086 --> 03:10:33,646
the chateau that goes over it. The water seems to butt
up against the chateau and vanish beneath it, to

2716
03:10:33,646 --> 03:10:35,987
continue within the actual structure.

2717
03:10:35,987 --> 03:10:41,516
As you head to the front gate you see the door
there, and there are two small handles on the

2718
03:10:41,516 --> 03:10:43,570
outside. You go to pull and it doesn't open.

2719
03:10:43,570 --> 03:10:45,354
TALIESIN: I knock.

2720
03:10:45,354 --> 03:10:58,370
MATT: It's that iron-like vibration of a heavy
gate. You wait a few moments, and in the distance,

2721
03:10:58,370 --> 03:11:04,906
you see the large two doors to the chateau, one peeks
open slightly and a little head peeks through.

2722
03:11:04,906 --> 03:11:07,164
TALIESIN: Hello.

2723
03:11:07,164 --> 03:11:14,392
MATT: It's about, maybe, 50 feet from you at this
distance, and he disappears back behind the door.

2724
03:11:14,392 --> 03:11:16,661
LAURA: Scanlan, hold up that necklace.

2725
03:11:16,661 --> 03:11:23,118
SAM: Yes, sorry. Distracted. Here.

2726
03:11:23,118 --> 03:11:29,007
TALIESIN: We're here on official business. Matters
of trade and of research.

2727
03:11:29,007 --> 03:11:35,773
MATT: The door still remains ajar, but the figure
has pulled back in. Are you shouting this at a

2728
03:11:35,773 --> 03:11:36,682
distance?

2729
03:11:36,682 --> 03:11:39,735
TALIESIN: Yes, I am. It will be very worth your
while, and someone will definitely wish to speak

2730
03:11:39,735 --> 03:11:41,683
with us. We've traveled from Tal'Dorei.

2731
03:11:41,683 --> 03:11:43,137
SAM: Can we just walk up to the door?

2732
03:11:43,137 --> 03:11:50,408
MATT: The head peeks out again and you get a
better look at it this time. It's short, oval to

2733
03:11:50,408 --> 03:12:01,045
the side almost? The head has this very wide,
short, stocky, very pointed nose and a very

2734
03:12:01,045 --> 03:12:06,656
pointed chin. No facial hair, however. Bald on top
and what you see as a bit of grey hair that's

2735
03:12:06,656 --> 03:12:14,275
frizzed on the sides. As it steps outside, you see
its stature is similar to Scanlan's. This appears

2736
03:12:14,275 --> 03:12:20,337
to be a gnomish individual. Pale skin, paler than
most of you and definitely most people you've seen

2737
03:12:20,337 --> 03:12:26,102
here in Ank'Harel and as it steps out, it has
white robes with gray streaks across the front and

2738
03:12:26,102 --> 03:12:32,086
back that fall into this cape in the back and with
its arms placed within its robes. Its small

2739
03:12:32,086 --> 03:12:38,442
footfalls comes across the path, over the bridge,
up to the front of the gate and is now facing you

2740
03:12:38,442 --> 03:12:45,567
guys on the other side of the gate. Up close, it
is a <i>very</i> old gnome. Those of you who have known

2741
03:12:45,567 --> 03:12:52,585
gnome longevity, that's many years. Strangely
adorable, the eyes are tiny and beady, the

2742
03:12:52,585 --> 03:12:58,192
eyebrows are furrowed. There's a slight smile and
this elderly sweetness to him as he approaches

2743
03:12:58,192 --> 03:13:00,395
with his arms in his robe.

2744
03:13:00,395 --> 03:13:01,954
LIAM: Hello there, grandfather.

2745
03:13:01,954 --> 03:13:03,330
MATT: "Yes?"

2746
03:13:03,330 --> 03:13:12,106
LIAM: We are looking for a bit of help. We've been
told that your knowledge is great and we have some

2747
03:13:12,106 --> 03:13:16,229
items that defy description.

2748
03:13:16,229 --> 03:13:18,637
LAURA: Are you Headmaster James Kryon?

2749
03:13:18,637 --> 03:13:21,930
MATT: "No, I am not. I am Grymond Trog."

2750
03:13:21,930 --> 03:13:24,413
LIAM: One more time, grandfather.

2751
03:13:24,413 --> 03:13:25,992
MATT: "Grymond Trog."

2752
03:13:25,992 --> 03:13:28,326
LIAM: Grymond Trog. It's a pleasure to meet you.

2753
03:13:28,326 --> 03:13:31,488
MATT: "You, as well, and well met, whoever you
are."

2754
03:13:31,488 --> 03:13:33,120
LAURA: Be pleased.

2755
03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:35,226
MATT: "You don't have to do that here."

2756
03:13:35,226 --> 03:13:44,289
LAURA: Could we meet with Headmaster James Kryon?
We've been sent by someone very important. J'mon

2757
03:13:44,289 --> 03:13:45,526
Sa Ord.

2758
03:13:45,526 --> 03:13:50,998
TALIESIN: From across the continent.

2759
03:13:50,998 --> 03:13:57,227
SAM: I flash the thing again and say, in Gnomish:
He'll want to talk to us. We've come a great

2760
03:13:57,227 --> 03:14:00,450
distance to meet him.

2761
03:14:00,450 --> 03:14:05,391
MATT: And he responds in Gnomish to you, "Very
well. I will go and see if the Headmaster is

2762
03:14:05,391 --> 03:14:10,982
"available. I cannot promise anything, but I will
return." You guys see this exchange in Gnomish. It

2763
03:14:10,982 --> 03:14:13,092
sounds like (fast twittering).

2764
03:14:13,092 --> 03:14:14,941
LAURA: I've never heard you speak Gnomish before,
Scanlan.

2765
03:14:14,941 --> 03:14:16,453
TRAVIS: What'd you say?

2766
03:14:16,453 --> 03:14:20,983
SAM: (sighs) I said: Someone loan me 350 gold.

2767
03:14:20,983 --> 03:14:23,303
LAURA: 350 gold? Why 350 gold?

2768
03:14:23,303 --> 03:14:25,050
LIAM: That's a very specific number.

2769
03:14:25,050 --> 03:14:26,536
TALIESIN: That's a very interesting number.

2770
03:14:26,536 --> 03:14:32,659
MATT: The gnome spins around and darts back into
little footfalls, coasting a strange little

2771
03:14:32,659 --> 03:14:36,738
zig-zag back to the original doors and disappears.
The doors don't close; they remain ajar.

2772
03:14:36,738 --> 03:14:38,788
LIAM: He's way faster than you.

2773
03:14:38,788 --> 03:14:40,405
LAURA: Why don't you walk that fast, Scanlan?

2774
03:14:40,405 --> 03:14:45,692
SAM: I'm carrying two giant sacks of spice. It
weighs me down.

2775
03:14:45,692 --> 03:14:49,358
TRAVIS: Do you want to put those in the bag of
holding?

2776
03:14:49,358 --> 03:14:51,163
SAM: No! They're mine.

2777
03:14:51,163 --> 03:14:53,693
TRAVIS: Your cross to bear. Got it.

2778
03:14:53,693 --> 03:15:02,203
MATT: You wait about 15 minutes before the gnome,
Grymond, pops his head out once more. "Just a

2779
03:15:02,203 --> 03:15:04,968
"minute." Pops back in.

2780
03:15:04,968 --> 03:15:07,218
LIAM: I like that little guy.

2781
03:15:07,218 --> 03:15:08,806
TALIESIN: I know; he's quite pleasing.

2782
03:15:08,806 --> 03:15:16,767
MATT: Pops back out about ten minutes later. Darts
over to the edge. "My apologies for keeping you

2783
03:15:16,767 --> 03:15:22,488
"waiting. The headmaster is unable to see visitors
at the moment."

2784
03:15:22,488 --> 03:15:24,124
LAURA: Oh no. Why?

2785
03:15:24,124 --> 03:15:25,952
MATT: "Perhaps try next week."

2786
03:15:25,952 --> 03:15:31,212
LAURA: Oh no, that's such a long time. We have a
very short amount of time; we're on a crunch.

2787
03:15:31,212 --> 03:15:33,836
MARISHA: Yes, is there a standby list we can get
on?

2788
03:15:33,836 --> 03:15:35,529
MATT: "Is there something I can help you with?"

2789
03:15:35,529 --> 03:15:40,500
LIAM: We are sort of trying to save--

2790
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:43,165
MARISHA: The world.

2791
03:15:43,165 --> 03:15:45,163
MATT: "That's very sweet."

2792
03:15:45,163 --> 03:15:48,954
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

2793
03:15:48,954 --> 03:15:53,028
MARISHA: Time is of the essence.

2794
03:15:53,028 --> 03:15:57,706
LAURA: 20.

2795
03:15:57,706 --> 03:15:59,026
MATT: 20?

2796
03:15:59,026 --> 03:16:06,211
SAM: Loot Crate, ladies and gentlemen. I'm wearing
one of the shirts right now. It came in this

2797
03:16:06,211 --> 03:16:12,103
month's Loot Box! Loot Crate, I think it's called,
actually, not a Loot Box.

2798
03:16:12,103 --> 03:16:14,617
LIAM: I hear it comes with a gram of spice in
every box.

2799
03:16:14,617 --> 03:16:25,368
SAM: Yeah, that alone makes it worth about $500.
Every box. In some circles. Oh boy, Travis is

2800
03:16:25,368 --> 03:16:26,380
looking!

2801
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:28,408
(laughter)

2802
03:16:28,408 --> 03:16:40,372
LAURA: Look, we're in a bit of a rush. This is
very important business. The fate of the world

2803
03:16:40,372 --> 03:16:42,653
rests on your shoulders.

2804
03:16:42,653 --> 03:16:47,535
MATT: Persuasion check.

2805
03:16:47,535 --> 03:16:50,146
SAM: Persuasion check. She's the best at those!

2806
03:16:50,146 --> 03:16:52,363
LAURA: I'm not terrible at it. 20.

2807
03:16:52,363 --> 03:16:53,769
SAM: That's good.

2808
03:16:53,769 --> 03:17:07,822
MATT: His eyes blink. Sigh. "Just a moment." Turns
around and disappears back up the walkway to the

2809
03:17:07,822 --> 03:17:10,837
building. You wait another <i>30</i> minutes.

2810
03:17:10,837 --> 03:17:13,215
LAURA: Fucking little gnome on a power trip.

2811
03:17:13,215 --> 03:17:15,661
LIAM: Worth it.

2812
03:17:15,661 --> 03:17:19,111
SAM: What are we asking when we get in, by the
way?

2813
03:17:19,111 --> 03:17:24,237
MATT: You wait another ten minutes, and right as
your frustration is beginning to mount and you're

2814
03:17:24,237 --> 03:17:29,830
ready to start rattling that gate, you see a
figure, much taller, step out from the open door

2815
03:17:29,830 --> 03:17:32,163
to the front of the Crystal Chateau.

2816
03:17:32,163 --> 03:17:34,569
LIAM: Eyes up!

2817
03:17:34,569 --> 03:17:42,686
MATT: Much slower and deliberate walk. This taller
humanoid, as it approaches, you see the same

2818
03:17:42,686 --> 03:17:49,263
white robes with the same silver grey band
that goes over the shoulders, the mantle pointing

2819
03:17:49,263 --> 03:17:54,744
out past the shoulders, as it passes back into a
cloak that drifts behind. The train of the robe's

2820
03:17:54,744 --> 03:18:00,670
dragging just a few inches past the back. They
seem longer than should be for a normal traveling

2821
03:18:00,670 --> 03:18:08,306
person; they're almost ceremonial. As the humanoid
approaches, you can see silver, almost

2822
03:18:08,306 --> 03:18:19,307
purple-colored hair, that just falls back and trails
past, without a stray hair in place, long past the

2823
03:18:19,307 --> 03:18:24,523
shoulders, almost like a secondary cloak and flows
with each step, just like the cloak does. The face

2824
03:18:24,523 --> 03:18:41,179
is pure elven, skin pale white, the eyes white
with a very faint gold iris. No pupil. Seems

2825
03:18:41,179 --> 03:18:45,892
young, though the graying hair does lead you to
believe that there is some age to this elven

2826
03:18:45,892 --> 03:18:53,836
individual. Approaches, hands together in front.
Eventually comes to the edge of the gate. "My

2827
03:18:53,836 --> 03:19:03,346
"apologies for the delay. Apparently, you have both
the assistance of the soul of the jeweled city at

2828
03:19:03,346 --> 03:19:14,899
"your disposal, and you've convinced my clerk that
you have important business. Well, you have ten

2829
03:19:14,899 --> 03:19:18,081
"minutes of my time. What can I do for you?"

2830
03:19:18,081 --> 03:19:21,577
TALIESIN: May we speak in private for that ten
minutes? It is sensitive.

2831
03:19:21,577 --> 03:19:27,756
MATT: "Very well." He snaps his fingers and utters
this incantation under his mouth. Suddenly you

2832
03:19:27,756 --> 03:19:37,655
have this crackling blue wall appear above you,
and you all are encased inside this cube-like box,

2833
03:19:37,655 --> 03:19:44,112
it's about 25 by 25 feet, you hear this slight
vibration crackling around you.

2834
03:19:44,112 --> 03:19:45,963
LAURA: Is the fence still between us?

2835
03:19:45,963 --> 03:19:50,577
MATT: The fence is still between us, but it's
enclosed. It closed all of you into this box,

2836
03:19:50,577 --> 03:19:57,064
including himself. And all the breeze that was
blowing through has been halted. You hear none of

2837
03:19:57,064 --> 03:20:05,304
the surrounding sounds of the city around you.
This appears to be a fairly private place.

2838
03:20:05,304 --> 03:20:08,868
(laughs) For at least the time he's willing to
give you.

2839
03:20:08,868 --> 03:20:11,534
TALIESIN: Do you know of the news of Tal'Dorei and
Emon?

2840
03:20:11,534 --> 03:20:18,329
MATT: "I don't really pay attention to matters
that far from where we are. I have important

2841
03:20:18,329 --> 03:20:19,941
"things to tend to."

2842
03:20:19,941 --> 03:20:26,417
TALIESIN: Foreign affairs, obviously. But I can
see that there are aspects of this place that are

2843
03:20:26,417 --> 03:20:36,999
foreign, that you have brought culture here. And I
pull out one of my guns, pull it out to show him

2844
03:20:36,999 --> 03:20:46,321
the hiltwork, which is all embedded with actual
whitestone. I cannot speak the name of where we

2845
03:20:46,321 --> 03:20:56,306
come from, but I know how this place was built,
and I know that perhaps we have a connection

2846
03:20:56,306 --> 03:21:02,144
because of it. And I'm going to--

2847
03:21:02,144 --> 03:21:03,817
SAM: Shoot him in the head.

2848
03:21:03,817 --> 03:21:05,665
(laughter)

2849
03:21:05,665 --> 03:21:12,086
TALIESIN: Dragons-- There's no secret to it.
Dragons are ravaging the continent. A chromatic

2850
03:21:12,086 --> 03:21:18,849
conclave of dragons, unlike we've ever seen
before, have decimated the cultures of the other

2851
03:21:18,849 --> 03:21:27,610
end of the earth. Dragons we have never seen
before, but you have. And I'm going to Minor

2852
03:21:27,610 --> 03:21:34,480
Illusion in my hand an image of the red dragon
with the ruby in his chest sitting atop. I'm

2853
03:21:34,480 --> 03:21:36,306
creating a little visual of it.

2854
03:21:36,306 --> 03:21:37,713
MATT: It's rudimentary.

2855
03:21:37,713 --> 03:21:41,126
TALIESIN: It's rudimentary, but it's there. It's
obviously an illusion; it's not meant to look

2856
03:21:41,126 --> 03:21:43,180
real. It's fuzzy.

2857
03:21:43,180 --> 03:21:49,380
MATT: It's a Princess Leia, froze, coming out of
R2D2 in A Lost Hope. Takes a look at it, seemingly

2858
03:21:49,380 --> 03:21:51,761
unmoved, and goes, "And?"

2859
03:21:51,761 --> 03:21:57,096
TALIESIN: They will come here. They will come here
and they will ravage. We've been given the

2860
03:21:57,096 --> 03:22:02,413
opportunity and the hope of stopping them before
they reach your shores.

2861
03:22:02,413 --> 03:22:08,534
LIAM: We have ended two of them, and we want to
end them all before they come anywhere near these

2862
03:22:08,534 --> 03:22:10,025
shores.

2863
03:22:10,025 --> 03:22:16,775
MATT: "That sounds like an absolutely remarkable
endeavor and I wish you the best of luck."

2864
03:22:16,775 --> 03:22:21,528
TALIESIN: If we could just have a bit of help,
identifying a few objects of magical power, and

2865
03:22:21,528 --> 03:22:28,537
hopefully finding a few more keys to stopping them,
it would ingratiate us to you so much that I would

2866
03:22:28,537 --> 03:22:35,428
be delighted to speak of a future of hopefully
making sure that more of this beautiful whitestone

2867
03:22:35,428 --> 03:22:43,470
that you use everywhere in this beautiful palace
is available and deeply indebted.

2868
03:22:43,470 --> 03:22:48,456
MATT: As you do say whitestone, his eyes for the
first time do lock into yours.

2869
03:22:48,456 --> 03:22:50,755
MARISHA: (whispering) Tell him who you are,
Percy!

2870
03:22:50,755 --> 03:22:53,004
TALIESIN: I cannot tell him who I am.

2871
03:22:53,004 --> 03:22:59,599
MATT: "Well. You now have six more minutes of my
time. If you are here for simple identification

2872
03:22:59,599 --> 03:23:03,208
"purposes, I can aid you in this. What would you
like me to see for you?"

2873
03:23:03,208 --> 03:23:07,589
TALIESIN: They are not simple. We are not starting
with the jug.

2874
03:23:07,589 --> 03:23:10,821
LIAM: Step up, Grog. Show him the gloves.

2875
03:23:10,821 --> 03:23:16,796
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. I got these Titanstone Knuckles
off my uncle. They make me bigger and stronger,

2876
03:23:16,796 --> 03:23:18,827
but I'm not sure what else they do.

2877
03:23:18,827 --> 03:23:24,405
MATT: He leans forward and places his hands
through the gate openings on the sides of where the

2878
03:23:24,405 --> 03:23:31,936
various bars are and touches them, and his eyes
flare with a flash of sudden arcane energy. His

2879
03:23:31,936 --> 03:23:41,976
hands just tense for a moment, and he lets go.
"Indeed they are. A Vestige! I have not seen one in

2880
03:23:41,976 --> 03:23:50,417
"person. Congratulations. That is a very worthy
find. There are museums and collectors that would

2881
03:23:50,417 --> 03:23:52,292
"pay quite a penny for such an item."

2882
03:23:52,292 --> 03:23:56,029
TRAVIS: No, I'm not interested in selling it.

2883
03:23:56,029 --> 03:23:59,093
MARISHA: But you have heard of these Vestiges
before?

2884
03:23:59,093 --> 03:24:01,257
MATT: "I have come across them in my research,
yes."

2885
03:24:01,257 --> 03:24:03,346
LIAM: We have three of them.

2886
03:24:03,346 --> 03:24:06,731
MARISHA: Have you heard of one called Cabal's
Ruin?

2887
03:24:06,731 --> 03:24:11,346
MATT: "I've heard of it."

2888
03:24:11,346 --> 03:24:13,278
MARISHA: It's a cloak.

2889
03:24:13,278 --> 03:24:22,854
MATT: "A cloak? Yes. Yes, I have come across it in
my papers before, but that was quite some time ago

2890
03:24:22,854 --> 03:24:27,729
"and that's the extent of my knowledge, I fear.
Sorry."

2891
03:24:27,729 --> 03:24:31,076
TALIESIN: Show him your bow.

2892
03:24:31,076 --> 03:24:33,611
LAURA: Our second Vestige.

2893
03:24:33,611 --> 03:24:40,545
MATT: Leans forward, this time with one hand and
touches the edge of it. As he touches the edge, it

2894
03:24:40,545 --> 03:24:47,429
curls against the tip of his finger and he pulls
back, a little bit creeped out by it.

2895
03:24:47,429 --> 03:24:50,034
LAURA: Fenthras.

2896
03:24:50,034 --> 03:24:56,979
MATT: "Fenthras." And his eyes flash again. The
bow seems to stop moving for a second and then

2897
03:24:56,979 --> 03:25:05,996
relax back into its slow, organic movement. "This
is also quite a find. A powerful weapon. Fey in

2898
03:25:05,996 --> 03:25:20,811
"nature. It seems to extend sight and grow that
which it slays." He gives you information on each

2899
03:25:20,811 --> 03:25:27,574
of these Vestiges as part of his Identify spell, and there is no
additional information beyond what you already know 
about the item.

2900
03:25:27,574 --> 03:25:30,596
LIAM: I misspoke. We have four. Scanlan, show him
your blade.

2901
03:25:30,596 --> 03:25:34,653
SAM: (French accent) Mythcarver!

2902
03:25:34,653 --> 03:25:36,379
MATT: (French accent) "Mythcarver?"

2903
03:25:36,379 --> 03:25:38,530
SAM: Is how some would say it.

2904
03:25:38,530 --> 03:25:45,522
MATT: He takes it. His eyes flash again as he
glances over the blade. "One of the non

2905
03:25:45,522 --> 03:25:49,499
"divine-based Vestiges. Here you are. Much like
those knuckles."

2906
03:25:49,499 --> 03:25:51,958
TRAVIS: Non-divine?

2907
03:25:51,958 --> 03:25:59,343
MATT: "Some were created in the sphere of some
deity's influence. Some were created by powerful

2908
03:25:59,343 --> 03:26:05,077
"practitioners of the arcane. Remember, the
Calamity, the battle that sparked the Divergence

2909
03:26:05,077 --> 03:26:11,585
"itself, was a battle against the gods, against
wayward arcane magics, and the division between

2910
03:26:11,585 --> 03:26:13,811
"the societal belief in both."

2911
03:26:13,811 --> 03:26:18,485
LAURA: Did anyone in the Allegiance create these
items?

2912
03:26:18,485 --> 03:26:26,380
MATT: "No, the Allegiance has only been around for
about 80, 90 years. But some of us have come

2913
03:26:26,380 --> 03:26:29,499
"across information about these, as scattered as
they are."

2914
03:26:29,499 --> 03:26:33,692
TALIESIN: We have the tea set, as well? Do we have
anything else?

2915
03:26:33,692 --> 03:26:39,333
SAM: Can you tell me anything more about the
blade?

2916
03:26:39,333 --> 03:26:45,918
MATT: "It resonates with sound and speech and
song." He gives you basically the information you

2917
03:26:45,918 --> 03:26:47,283
have about the Mythcarver.

2918
03:26:47,283 --> 03:26:53,266
LIAM: Probably overkill, but I draw back the white
that I'm wearing. What of this armor? Can you tell

2919
03:26:53,266 --> 03:26:55,283
me anything about it?

2920
03:26:55,283 --> 03:27:00,768
MATT: He reaches forward and touches the armor.
Eyes flash again. He gives you a full, detailed

2921
03:27:00,768 --> 03:27:17,743
description of the armor you're holding. He says,
"This has been awakened. Interesting, yes. It's

2922
03:27:17,743 --> 03:27:24,528
"rare that artifacts have an awakening.
Interesting."

2923
03:27:24,528 --> 03:27:28,978
LIAM: Is that something that any of these would
do?

2924
03:27:28,978 --> 03:27:32,926
MATT: "I do not know. This is my first time
actually handling any Vestiges. For the record,

2925
03:27:32,926 --> 03:27:38,797
"you carrying this many puts quite a target on your
back from anyone who's interested in selling them

2926
03:27:38,797 --> 03:27:45,747
"or making them their own. I would recommend not
telling anyone what you have in your possession."

2927
03:27:45,747 --> 03:27:48,003
TALIESIN: You are the only one that we've told.

2928
03:27:48,003 --> 03:27:49,752
MATT: "Good, keep it that way."

2929
03:27:49,752 --> 03:27:53,076
TALIESIN: Just a few more things.

2930
03:27:53,076 --> 03:27:57,948
LAURA: I pull out the tea set that has LM engraved
on it, that we got in--

2931
03:27:57,948 --> 03:28:08,464
MATT: "Unfortunately, you've expended most of my
identification this day."

2932
03:28:08,464 --> 03:28:13,683
TALIESIN: Less of a magical investigation, then. I
pull out a piece of the green elemental shard from

2933
03:28:13,683 --> 03:28:16,507
Whitestone and show it to him.

2934
03:28:16,507 --> 03:28:25,581
MATT: "Might I have a look at that?" He takes it,
reaches into his robes, pulls out a very

2935
03:28:25,581 --> 03:28:35,867
well-crafted glass jeweler's piece, glances over
it for a second. He clicks a small button on the

2936
03:28:35,867 --> 03:28:44,853
side of it. Each time he does, you see the lens
change color on the end of it. "I have not seen

2937
03:28:44,853 --> 03:28:51,007
"anything like this. Not of condensed, purified
whitestone."

2938
03:28:51,007 --> 03:28:54,009
TALIESIN: Yes. I take it back.

2939
03:28:54,009 --> 03:29:05,033
MATT: As you take it, he gives a little
resistance, "The possibilities of such a substance

2940
03:29:05,033 --> 03:29:07,703
"is intriguing."

2941
03:29:07,703 --> 03:29:09,328
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

2942
03:29:09,328 --> 03:29:13,205
MATT: Go for it.

2943
03:29:13,205 --> 03:29:16,522
MARISHA: 19.

2944
03:29:16,522 --> 03:29:20,223
MATT: Okay.

2945
03:29:20,223 --> 03:29:31,755
LAURA: Can we ask him how he got his purple hair?
Because I want some purple hair.

2946
03:29:31,755 --> 03:29:36,907
TRAVIS: Make sure to visit the Geek and Sundry
store for all of our new merch items!

2947
03:29:36,907 --> 03:29:41,218
LIAM: Espionage nail wraps!

2948
03:29:41,218 --> 03:29:43,499
TRAVIS: We've got these new bitching bracelets!

2949
03:29:43,499 --> 03:29:47,167
SAM: But these have Critical Role themes to them!

2950
03:29:47,167 --> 03:29:49,497
LAURA: Look, Sam, we have a Critical Role mug!

2951
03:29:49,497 --> 03:29:56,927
SAM: No way, that's really available? I want one!
How much are they? $50, $100? Just $20?

2952
03:29:56,927 --> 03:29:58,530
TALIESIN: Think of all the spice you could get!

2953
03:29:58,530 --> 03:30:08,003
MATT: "Should you have any more that you do not
require, I am sure I could convince the Allegiance

2954
03:30:08,003 --> 03:30:10,671
"to pay quite a hefty sum."

2955
03:30:10,671 --> 03:30:16,559
TALIESIN: Money doesn't interest us at this point.
We are under siege. But cooperation and help in

2956
03:30:16,559 --> 03:30:25,617
our endeavor certainly does. The process is known
to my people and a closely guarded secret,

2957
03:30:25,617 --> 03:30:34,807
obviously. We would be happy to restore normal
relations once we are no longer in danger. Excited

2958
03:30:34,807 --> 03:30:39,918
for normal relations, and proper trade. We are a
city in need.

2959
03:30:39,918 --> 03:30:41,866
MATT: "If I may have your name, then, sir?"

2960
03:30:41,866 --> 03:30:51,446
TALIESIN: I do not give him my name, but I put
together a quick piece of paper with the royal seal.

2961
03:30:51,446 --> 03:31:00,862
MATT: Okay. He takes it.

2962
03:31:00,862 --> 03:31:09,485
TALIESIN: It's enough that you need not have any
paper proof of who I am, other than the fact that

2963
03:31:09,485 --> 03:31:14,326
if this place was built, then that should be very
useful to you. If this place was built the way we

2964
03:31:14,326 --> 03:31:22,597
expect. If we survive, and especially with your
cooperation and help, we will be back to this

2965
03:31:22,597 --> 03:31:24,716
city, and we will be grateful.

2966
03:31:24,716 --> 03:31:31,027
MARISHA: We can always come back with more of this
condensed whitestone in tow.

2967
03:31:31,027 --> 03:31:33,375
TALIESIN: It's very expensive and very rare,
sadly.

2968
03:31:33,375 --> 03:31:40,954
MATT: "I look forward to your return once this
wyrm intrusion is completed, and we can discuss

2969
03:31:40,954 --> 03:31:42,252
"business."

2970
03:31:42,252 --> 03:31:47,302
TALIESIN: Worm intrusion? Oh, the wyrm. I thought
you were talking about the hole out front. Is that

2971
03:31:47,302 --> 03:31:51,611
anything we can help with? We're quite adept.

2972
03:31:51,611 --> 03:31:57,968
MATT: "No, we're good, but thank you."

2973
03:31:57,968 --> 03:32:02,633
LIAM: I hate to wear out our welcome, but you said
you were spent. Is it possible your friend who

2974
03:32:02,633 --> 03:32:05,922
scuttled off could have a look at my sister's tea
set?

2975
03:32:05,922 --> 03:32:13,683
LAURA: Oh, really, they are so smart and
magical--

2976
03:32:13,683 --> 03:32:18,841
MATT: "You are asking us to spend this last minute
of time that I've promised to you to retrieve my

2977
03:32:18,841 --> 03:32:22,087
"clerk to see what your tea set does?"

2978
03:32:22,087 --> 03:32:25,013
LIAM: I was asking that, yes.

2979
03:32:25,013 --> 03:32:26,331
MATT: "Very well."

2980
03:32:26,331 --> 03:32:34,399
TRAVIS: Well, I have a question. Would you ever
engage in matters outside of this stupid-ass place?

2981
03:32:34,399 --> 03:32:39,985
MATT: "Referring to what?"

2982
03:32:39,985 --> 03:32:45,649
TRAVIS: You know, other countries, people in
danger, dragons. You seem to be a powerful

2983
03:32:45,649 --> 03:32:48,843
magician of some sort. Would you ever help?

2984
03:32:48,843 --> 03:33:00,285
MATT: "I do not, nor does the Allegiance, get
involved in political matters. We are simply a

2985
03:33:00,285 --> 03:33:04,432
"collection of scholars and we attempt to keep it
that."

2986
03:33:04,432 --> 03:33:10,656
LAURA: In your scholarly knowledge, do you know
how to kill a red dragon?

2987
03:33:10,656 --> 03:33:13,162
TALIESIN: With no heart?

2988
03:33:13,162 --> 03:33:21,865
MATT: "I would say that is probably a bit beyond
my capability. But if, indeed, that little bauble

2989
03:33:21,865 --> 03:33:30,283
"that your tiny friend carries is to believe true, I
think you've already found favors and allies far

2990
03:33:30,283 --> 03:33:32,252
"beyond anything we could provide."

2991
03:33:32,252 --> 03:33:40,967
TALIESIN: We need everything we can get, and we
are down several libraries on our continent. They

2992
03:33:40,967 --> 03:33:43,722
do enjoy watching the knowledge of the ages burn.

2993
03:33:43,722 --> 03:33:50,200
MATT: "Well, perhaps you should get on seeing them
felled fairly soon, then."

2994
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:56,026
MARISHA: Hopefully, take this as the fair warning
that it was meant to be.

2995
03:33:56,026 --> 03:34:03,595
MATT: "The city has seen quite a few aggressors,
and not one has made it farther than the outside walls."

2996
03:34:03,595 --> 03:34:05,699
MARISHA: So I have heard.

2997
03:34:05,699 --> 03:34:08,703
LAURA: But this isn't one. This is several.

2998
03:34:08,703 --> 03:34:13,501
TALIESIN: And that is why they have given us their
favors, because they understand that this threat

2999
03:34:13,501 --> 03:34:14,937
is greater.

3000
03:34:14,937 --> 03:34:19,182
MATT: "And yet you have already felled a few
yourselves. I am certain you will be

3001
03:34:19,182 --> 03:34:22,486
"successful in the rest of your endeavor."

3002
03:34:22,486 --> 03:34:28,927
MARISHA: One last note. You mentioned Cabal's
Ruin? Have you heard of the Den of Druja?

3003
03:34:28,927 --> 03:34:42,416
MATT: "Druja? Yes, that was naught but 60 years
ago. There was a bit of an incursion, an uprising,

3004
03:34:42,416 --> 03:34:47,418
"of a guild that was getting a bit big for its
britches and was muscling its way through most of

3005
03:34:47,418 --> 03:34:55,198
"the Suncut Bazaar. Some sort of a conflict arose,
and the streets were lined with bodies at certain

3006
03:34:55,198 --> 03:35:01,840
"moments. However, it seems that they were dealt
with rather quickly, succinctly. One of our

3007
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:06,732
"wayward mages that had apparently been helping
helm this endeavor was brought to justice with a

3008
03:35:06,732 --> 03:35:08,476
"blade to his throat."

3009
03:35:08,476 --> 03:35:15,381
MARISHA: Really? What was the name of this
sorcerer? Magician? Mage?

3010
03:35:15,381 --> 03:35:26,088
MATT: "I mean no disrespect to you, but it is a
place of particular sourness and shame within the

3011
03:35:26,088 --> 03:35:28,377
"Allegiance, and we wish to move on from it."

3012
03:35:28,377 --> 03:35:35,500
MARISHA: Sure. But isn't knowledge like this best
known so that history does not repeat itself?

3013
03:35:35,500 --> 03:35:40,028
MATT: "We know it well, and it will not be
repeated. I do not know you, yet you ask us

3014
03:35:40,028 --> 03:35:45,705
"questions deep within our history that we do not
wish to discuss for our own reasons."

3015
03:35:45,705 --> 03:35:50,695
TRAVIS: Lot of answers we got here. Lot of
answers.

3016
03:35:50,695 --> 03:35:54,192
SAM: Maybe we just asked the wrong questions.

3017
03:35:54,192 --> 03:35:56,693
TRAVIS: Maybe I should just ask him to identify
this.

3018
03:35:56,693 --> 03:36:01,234
TALIESIN: I think you've already burned the charge
on that one for the day.

3019
03:36:01,234 --> 03:36:09,231
MATT: As you put your finger up, he puts up three
fingers. "And that is your ten minutes. Thank you

3020
03:36:09,231 --> 03:36:14,898
"so much for your time. Please, do make sure the
Allegiance knows once you've completed your

3021
03:36:14,898 --> 03:36:20,587
"journey up in wherever these dragons are and
return. I think there are many things we could

3022
03:36:20,587 --> 03:36:27,376
"discuss, to the benefit of both you and us. Now, I
have things to attend to. I wish you good day."

3023
03:36:27,376 --> 03:36:28,937
TALIESIN: Good day to you, sir.

3024
03:36:28,937 --> 03:36:31,437
LAURA: You ruined your business deal. Have fun.

3025
03:36:31,437 --> 03:36:37,182
TRAVIS: He counted ten like this! I thought they
were <i>learned</i>.

3026
03:36:37,182 --> 03:36:42,748
MATT: And with that, he exits back and the door
closes shut.

3027
03:36:42,748 --> 03:36:44,340
LAURA: That guy was a dick.

3028
03:36:44,340 --> 03:36:46,852
TALIESIN: Yes, he was, but we did learn some
things.

3029
03:36:46,852 --> 03:36:49,799
SAM: To be fair, we were asking him favors for no
benefit.

3030
03:36:49,799 --> 03:36:52,050
LAURA: This is true, but he was a snob.

3031
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:54,445
TALIESIN: There was plenty of benefit to him.

3032
03:36:54,445 --> 03:36:57,233
MARISHA: We don't do well with snobbery.

3033
03:36:57,233 --> 03:36:59,036
SAM: Do you want me to burn down his house?

3034
03:36:59,036 --> 03:37:07,377
TRAVIS: Triceratops! Triceratops! All right, easy,
killer, easy.

3035
03:37:07,377 --> 03:37:11,088
MARISHA: All right, so, we know a little bit
more.

3036
03:37:11,088 --> 03:37:12,745
SAM: Nothing.

3037
03:37:12,745 --> 03:37:15,973
LAURA: No, a little bit more. We need to find out
who this mage was.

3038
03:37:15,973 --> 03:37:23,470
MARISHA: The Den of Druja was a guild. 60 years
ago, though. That's quite a long time.

3039
03:37:23,470 --> 03:37:25,792
SAM: We need to reach out to this woman, right?

3040
03:37:25,792 --> 03:37:27,265
LAURA: Maybe she's really old.

3041
03:37:27,265 --> 03:37:31,788
SAM: We do know where she lives.

3042
03:37:31,788 --> 03:37:39,034
TALIESIN: You could go and check, and we could
hang back.

3043
03:37:39,034 --> 03:37:41,145
SAM: I have contacts in the underworld here.

3044
03:37:41,145 --> 03:37:44,188
LAURA: They respect you.

3045
03:37:44,188 --> 03:37:48,189
TRAVIS: The name of the Meat Man goes a long way.

3046
03:37:48,189 --> 03:37:51,840
MARISHA: What time is it right now?

3047
03:37:51,840 --> 03:37:56,866
MATT: This time, the four hours lost since waking,
you're probably pushing 2:00 in the afternoon.

3048
03:37:56,866 --> 03:38:03,652
SAM: Should we go pay a visit to what's-her-butt?
What's our play here? We need her?

3049
03:38:03,652 --> 03:38:09,126
LAURA: We need Cabal's Ruin. But we don't want to
cause too much of a ruckus, because I don't want

3050
03:38:09,126 --> 03:38:12,480
to put ourselves at odds with J'mon Sa Ord.

3051
03:38:12,480 --> 03:38:17,598
MARISHA: Maybe we should find out more about this
Den of Druja. It sounds like there was quite a

3052
03:38:17,598 --> 03:38:19,846
civil war that happened back in the day.

3053
03:38:19,846 --> 03:38:28,057
SAM: Did we make a mistake here? Should we have
said something else? But what information could

3054
03:38:28,057 --> 03:38:29,940
this person have given us?

3055
03:38:29,940 --> 03:38:31,837
LAURA: Access to a library?

3056
03:38:31,837 --> 03:38:35,745
TRAVIS: If we had more of that stuff from Percy's
place, he'd be more willing to share.

3057
03:38:35,745 --> 03:38:37,876
SAM: Percy, can you give him that piece?

3058
03:38:37,876 --> 03:38:40,176
TALIESIN: I don't trust him with it.

3059
03:38:40,176 --> 03:38:42,175
TRAVIS: I can't imagine why.

3060
03:38:42,175 --> 03:38:44,303
MARISHA: He was definitely very interested in it.

3061
03:38:44,303 --> 03:38:48,095
SAM: We could sneak in.

3062
03:38:48,095 --> 03:38:51,055
TALIESIN: No. How?

3063
03:38:51,055 --> 03:38:57,555
SAM: We could just go down the hole. See what's
there. Kiki and I could be dragonflies and just

3064
03:38:57,555 --> 03:38:58,796
buzz on down.

3065
03:38:58,796 --> 03:39:00,984
TRAVIS: That's true, you're little drones!

3066
03:39:00,984 --> 03:39:06,583
LAURA: This is an entire area of mages! You don't
think they'll notice when you use Polymorph?

3067
03:39:06,583 --> 03:39:11,981
MARISHA: Well, mine's beast shape. Mine's natural.
I'm <i>au naturel</i>.

3068
03:39:11,981 --> 03:39:14,428
MATT: Magical effect, just so you know.

3069
03:39:14,428 --> 03:39:15,747
TALIESIN: It's just organic.

3070
03:39:15,747 --> 03:39:18,081
MARISHA: It's organically natural.

3071
03:39:18,081 --> 03:39:21,505
MATT: Free-range magic.

3072
03:39:21,505 --> 03:39:31,799
SAM: So our options are go down the hole, get
caught; go find the girl with the cloak--

3073
03:39:31,799 --> 03:39:33,476
MARISHA: Get caught.

3074
03:39:33,476 --> 03:39:43,273
SAM: Or all bum rush my friends at the casino, and
get <i>revenge</i>. Maybe they know something more

3075
03:39:43,273 --> 03:39:44,636
about things!

3076
03:39:44,636 --> 03:39:47,638
TALIESIN: It's just 50 gold. I don't see why
you're getting so uptight about it.

3077
03:39:47,638 --> 03:39:50,744
SAM: It was my lucky gold piece that I got.

3078
03:39:50,744 --> 03:39:52,526
TALIESIN: Why would you spend your lucky gold
piece?

3079
03:39:52,526 --> 03:39:54,930
SAM: It was buried in with the rest. I didn't
notice it.

3080
03:39:54,930 --> 03:39:56,689
TALIESIN: Well, maybe if you just ask them to give
it back--

3081
03:39:56,689 --> 03:39:59,980
LIAM: You are really uptight about this!

3082
03:39:59,980 --> 03:40:03,649
SAM: I need a nap, that's all. I need a nap.

3083
03:40:03,649 --> 03:40:07,591
TRAVIS: How about we go up to the woman, then, if
the hole sounds like a bad idea?

3084
03:40:07,591 --> 03:40:10,338
LAURA: Yeah, let's make our way over that way.

3085
03:40:10,338 --> 03:40:11,991
TRAVIS: Come on, sneaky sneaker.

3086
03:40:11,991 --> 03:40:19,164
LIAM: Well, I can take us there. Do we want to be
genuine and knock on the door? I can't think that

3087
03:40:19,164 --> 03:40:21,755
it's going to be useful to go sneaking in.

3088
03:40:21,755 --> 03:40:24,895
LAURA: Maybe she's taken the cloak off and we can
take it.

3089
03:40:24,895 --> 03:40:31,080
SAM: You know, there's also one other. We've
heard that there's shady people at the-- Wait,

3090
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:32,756
have we been to the Debt's Respite?

3091
03:40:32,756 --> 03:40:34,215
LAURA: That's where we're staying.

3092
03:40:34,215 --> 03:40:37,811
MARISHA: That's our hotel, Scanlan.

3093
03:40:37,811 --> 03:40:39,937
TRAVIS: He drank a bit last night.

3094
03:40:39,937 --> 03:40:44,083
LAURA: Scanlan, do you need to go find a house of
lady favors?

3095
03:40:44,083 --> 03:40:46,229
MARISHA: The Hilton by the airport, not downtown.

3096
03:40:46,229 --> 03:40:48,292
LIAM: We got a full night's sleep, right?

3097
03:40:48,292 --> 03:40:49,439
MATT: Yeah, you did.

3098
03:40:49,439 --> 03:40:54,889
TRAVIS: Vax, do you feel like we should be
door-knockers instead of sneakers?

3099
03:40:54,889 --> 03:40:56,481
LIAM: I feel like door-knocker.

3100
03:40:56,481 --> 03:41:00,046
SAM: Let's knock on Mistress Asharru's door.

3101
03:41:00,046 --> 03:41:01,864
MARISHA: Hang on, we're just going to go knock and
say what?

3102
03:41:01,864 --> 03:41:05,925
LAURA: "Hey can we have your Vestige that's super
valuable?"

3103
03:41:05,925 --> 03:41:07,522
SAM: Maybe we could trade her one!

3104
03:41:07,522 --> 03:41:09,411
LIAM: What's your idea?

3105
03:41:09,411 --> 03:41:13,443
LAURA: I have no idea. Maybe wait until she comes
to find us?

3106
03:41:13,443 --> 03:41:15,697
SAM: We could do some recon on her place.

3107
03:41:15,697 --> 03:41:17,199
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

3108
03:41:17,199 --> 03:41:18,389
TALIESIN: Let's take a look.

3109
03:41:18,389 --> 03:41:21,148
MATT: Okay. You guys all heading there?

3110
03:41:21,148 --> 03:41:26,887
LIAM: I don't think we should do that. So that
Grog doesn't knock over a whole cart.

3111
03:41:26,887 --> 03:41:29,444
TALIESIN: We are going to definitely hang about a
block back.

3112
03:41:29,493 --> 03:41:31,341
LIAM: I think you and I should go.

3113
03:41:31,341 --> 03:41:32,771
LAURA: Me?

3114
03:41:32,771 --> 03:41:34,766
LIAM: Yeah. We're good at it.

3115
03:41:34,766 --> 03:41:42,085
SAM: I could go up to the front door and pretend
to be a FedEx delivery guy or something.

3116
03:41:42,085 --> 03:41:44,846
LIAM: I pick up Scanlan like a football and walk
off with my sister.

3117
03:41:44,846 --> 03:41:50,491
MATT: All right. So the three of you guys make
your way, remembering the path that you very

3118
03:41:50,491 --> 03:41:54,056
carefully marked in your memory, to where you
followed the messenger through the other day.

3119
03:41:54,056 --> 03:42:00,833
You guys follow Vax back to the outside of the
Debt's Respite and trace the path in which he

3120
03:42:00,833 --> 03:42:07,637
followed that silent messenger that Treev had sent
off when you first made your request of the

3121
03:42:07,637 --> 03:42:13,868
mistress. Heading through alleyways, diving over
from upper to lower levels through long hallways,

3122
03:42:13,868 --> 03:42:23,023
beneath buildings, to small side roads, until
eventually you find your way into this small area

3123
03:42:23,023 --> 03:42:28,569
that's nestled in between two large warehouses.
There appears to be some crates. There's some

3124
03:42:28,569 --> 03:42:34,678
barrels around this small building that reads, on
the sign above the door, A Kingly Home. The door

3125
03:42:34,678 --> 03:42:42,927
is closed. There appears to be a window right next
to the door. There is the series of barrels, and

3126
03:42:42,927 --> 03:42:48,579
there's the one barrel you saw where the
individual moved it and placed the actual request

3127
03:42:48,579 --> 03:42:51,694
that you guys made through a small slot in the
wall.

3128
03:42:51,694 --> 03:42:53,448
LAURA: Are there any other people around?

3129
03:42:53,448 --> 03:43:00,507
MATT: You can see-- actually, everyone roll a
stealth check, who's coming through. Yeah, you

3130
03:43:00,507 --> 03:43:02,643
guys are behind, so the three of you guys.

3131
03:43:02,643 --> 03:43:04,166
SAM: 14.

3132
03:43:04,166 --> 03:43:05,281
LIAM: 25.

3133
03:43:05,281 --> 03:43:07,059
TRAVIS: 14.

3134
03:43:07,059 --> 03:43:08,720
MATT: Not you, Grog. You're not going.

3135
03:43:08,720 --> 03:43:10,027
LAURA: 16.

3136
03:43:10,027 --> 03:43:18,732
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way through the
hallway. As you turn the corner, there is one

3137
03:43:18,732 --> 03:43:25,490
person turning around the corner the opposite
direction, who's carrying a bundle of various

3138
03:43:25,490 --> 03:43:33,111
large, nut-like fruits. He turns and bumps into
you and almost drops it and catches it, "Be more

3139
03:43:33,111 --> 03:43:38,715
"careful," then just continues walking past. You
guys look into the main area where the home is,

3140
03:43:38,715 --> 03:43:42,739
and it's right there before you. Other than that
person who just passed by, it's pretty quiet here.

3141
03:43:42,739 --> 03:43:46,953
This part of the city doesn't see a lot of foot
traffic, which is probably why it makes for a nice

3142
03:43:46,953 --> 03:43:48,710
home for an individual that does shady work.

3143
03:43:48,710 --> 03:43:51,241
LIAM: And nobody's hiding?

3144
03:43:51,241 --> 03:43:53,489
MATT: You can make a perception check.

3145
03:43:53,489 --> 03:43:58,439
LIAM: 27.

3146
03:43:58,439 --> 03:44:01,991
SAM: Nothing.

3147
03:44:01,991 --> 03:44:05,225
LAURA: 32.

3148
03:44:05,225 --> 03:44:10,601
MATT: You guys take the next few minutes quietly
off in the shadows, looking about the upper and

3149
03:44:10,601 --> 03:44:16,139
lower regions of this small alcove where the house
is. About four or five minutes into that, you're

3150
03:44:16,139 --> 03:44:21,528
pretty certain that nobody here is hidden and you
are alone other than the home, at least for the

3151
03:44:21,528 --> 03:44:22,785
time being.

3152
03:44:22,785 --> 03:44:24,983
SAM: Should I just go knock on the front door?

3153
03:44:24,983 --> 03:44:30,510
LIAM: That was my suggestion, but I thought we
came here to watch for a bit. I say to Scanlan,

3154
03:44:30,510 --> 03:44:32,211
sitting on my shoulders.

3155
03:44:32,211 --> 03:44:39,824
LAURA: Should we go peek in the window, maybe?
Maybe you, since you're sneaky? Oh yeah, or that.

3156
03:44:39,824 --> 03:44:42,983
Scanlan, you can turn into a bug or something.

3157
03:44:42,983 --> 03:44:45,190
SAM: Whatever you want.

3158
03:44:45,190 --> 03:44:49,235
LAURA: Ooh, I can use-- wait, does this have to
be--

3159
03:44:49,235 --> 03:44:50,501
LIAM: I think bug.

3160
03:44:50,501 --> 03:44:51,884
SAM: Bug? You want bug?

3161
03:44:51,884 --> 03:45:00,331
LAURA: This doesn't have to be attuned. I have,
from a long fucking time ago, the cloak of the

3162
03:45:00,331 --> 03:45:01,633
scuttling rat.

3163
03:45:01,633 --> 03:45:04,714
SAM: I don't even know what that is.

3164
03:45:04,714 --> 03:45:06,933
MATT: Does it require attunement?

3165
03:45:06,933 --> 03:45:10,874
LAURA: It doesn't say.

3166
03:45:10,874 --> 03:45:13,658
MATT: Do you have a cloak attuned to you right
now?

3167
03:45:13,658 --> 03:45:16,577
LAURA: No, I don't have a cloak attuned to me
because--

3168
03:45:16,577 --> 03:45:20,237
MATT: That's correct, you do not. So yeah, you
could put that on if you want.

3169
03:45:20,237 --> 03:45:24,791
LIAM: This says five minutes of rat form. Scanlan
can go all night long.

3170
03:45:24,791 --> 03:45:30,850
SAM: You know why they call her Vex the Rat?

3171
03:45:30,850 --> 03:45:33,696
LIAM: Do you know why they call her that?

3172
03:45:33,696 --> 03:45:42,849
SAM: Do you want me to do a bug? Be a bug? All
right, I'll be a beautiful dragonfly.

3173
03:45:42,849 --> 03:45:49,418
MATT: (buzzing) Scanlan becomes this dragonfly
with gorgeous, rainbow-like color and a tiny

3174
03:45:49,418 --> 03:45:53,968
little beret. What do you want to do, Scanlan?

3175
03:45:53,968 --> 03:45:57,622
SAM: Look for any openings in the windows or
vents--

3176
03:45:57,622 --> 03:46:01,384
MATT: You (tink) against the glass. The window is
closed.

3177
03:46:01,384 --> 03:46:03,325
LAURA: Is there a fireplace?

3178
03:46:03,325 --> 03:46:07,022
MATT: The door is actually pretty flush with the
ground.

3179
03:46:07,022 --> 03:46:13,786
SAM: Chimneys? Air intakes?

3180
03:46:13,786 --> 03:46:17,871
MATT: You glance over the top of the roof. There
actually is no chimney.

3181
03:46:17,871 --> 03:46:21,520
SAM: Right, so then I'll just hang out by a window
for a little bit and look.

3182
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:24,090
LAURA: What about the little thing where the note
got slipped in?

3183
03:46:24,090 --> 03:46:25,830
SAM: I don't know anything about that.

3184
03:46:25,830 --> 03:46:32,129
MATT: You guys watch the dragonfly (tink)

3185
03:46:32,129 --> 03:46:34,077
SAM: Do I see anyone in any of the windows?

3186
03:46:34,077 --> 03:46:38,589
MATT: It's dark inside. The drapes are drawn
except for a little bit of a sliver where the

3187
03:46:38,589 --> 03:46:43,666
light would get through. You see a little peek of
a wooden floor, but there's no light from the

3188
03:46:43,666 --> 03:46:44,975
inside.

3189
03:46:44,975 --> 03:46:52,339
SAM: Okay. Just going to go all the way around the
house, high and low, looking for a way in. Do I

3190
03:46:52,339 --> 03:46:53,424
find it?

3191
03:46:53,424 --> 03:46:55,428
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3192
03:46:55,428 --> 03:46:58,334
SAM: A lot. 24.

3193
03:46:58,334 --> 03:47:02,632
MATT: 24. After coming around, you begin to slink
around by the barrels and you can see, in the

3194
03:47:02,632 --> 03:47:08,532
stonework that has been built, the masonry that
forms the exterior of the building, there appears

3195
03:47:08,532 --> 03:47:15,436
to be a very small hole, about cork-size, hidden
behind one of the barrels in the front. There's

3196
03:47:15,436 --> 03:47:20,891
just enough space between the wall where you can
barely squeeze in and poke through. It's big

3197
03:47:20,891 --> 03:47:25,175
enough where your wings will hit, so you have to
attach to it and crawl through before coming out

3198
03:47:25,175 --> 03:47:31,463
the other side. As you come out the other side,
you're now inside the house. Dark interior. Make a

3199
03:47:31,463 --> 03:47:33,176
perception check.

3200
03:47:33,176 --> 03:47:36,679
SAM: One.

3201
03:47:36,679 --> 03:47:42,454
MATT: You're inside the building, but it is very
dark. All you see is the one little beam of light

3202
03:47:42,454 --> 03:47:46,842
coming through the window that is facing where the
sun currently is in the sky and is creating the

3203
03:47:46,842 --> 03:47:51,976
one beam on the ground and the little bit of wood
that's there. That's as much as you can make out

3204
03:47:51,976 --> 03:47:53,266
at the moment.

3205
03:47:53,266 --> 03:47:56,685
SAM: I will fly around and see if I knock into
anything.

3206
03:47:56,685 --> 03:48:05,680
MATT: You knock into a shelf unit. (buzzing) You
knock into another shelf unit. (buzzing) You stop

3207
03:48:05,680 --> 03:48:11,843
on the top of a chair that's off in a far corner.
Go over it. You glance over and a little bit of

3208
03:48:11,843 --> 03:48:15,088
light is bouncing off the sunbeam. You can see,
beneath the opening where you came in, the

3209
03:48:15,088 --> 03:48:23,287
rolled-up scroll, that was placed inside the small
case that held your guys' message, is still

3210
03:48:23,287 --> 03:48:25,668
resting right beneath the opening, untouched.

3211
03:48:25,668 --> 03:48:28,783
MARISHA: Wow, they haven't even opened it?
Assholes.

3212
03:48:28,783 --> 03:48:30,421
LAURA: Maybe she hasn't been home.

3213
03:48:30,421 --> 03:48:37,128
SAM: Am I in a room that's closed off? Can I keep
going through the house?

3214
03:48:37,128 --> 03:48:39,279
MATT: Yeah, you can keep going through the house.
There's a big part of the house you haven't

3215
03:48:39,279 --> 03:48:40,222
explored yet.

3216
03:48:40,222 --> 03:48:41,514
SAM: All right, I'll see if I can make my way.

3217
03:48:41,514 --> 03:48:45,477
MATT: Make another perception check.

3218
03:48:45,477 --> 03:48:46,802
SAM: Five.

3219
03:48:46,802 --> 03:49:00,339
MATT: All right. It's fairly dark in here. Let me
check one thing in the monster manual. I'm just

3220
03:49:00,339 --> 03:49:03,375
going to see if there's some possibility--

3221
03:49:03,375 --> 03:49:05,668
SAM: I doubt dragonflies are even in the monster
manual.

3222
03:49:05,668 --> 03:49:07,237
MATT: No, but I'm looking for--

3223
03:49:07,237 --> 03:49:09,330
TRAVIS: The thing that's about to eat you.

3224
03:49:09,330 --> 03:49:13,510
SAM: Look for dragon perception.

3225
03:49:13,510 --> 03:49:15,884
TALIESIN: A dire dragonfly.

3226
03:49:15,884 --> 03:49:20,584
MATT: Honestly, thinking about it here, you
probably might have blindsight from a lot of

3227
03:49:20,584 --> 03:49:21,892
different insects.

3228
03:49:21,892 --> 03:49:27,827
TALIESIN: They've got the big prismatic hoo-ha.

3229
03:49:27,827 --> 03:49:36,536
MATT: I'm not an expert on insect biology. As you
putter around to the opposite side of the room,

3230
03:49:36,536 --> 03:49:48,947
you can see there is a small table. There is a
very simple bed on the side. There is a carpet

3231
03:49:48,947 --> 03:49:55,166
that has been pulled and half-folded over. There
is an opening on the floor on the opposite corner,

3232
03:49:55,166 --> 03:49:58,272
a staircase that descends below, and a trapdoor
that is left open.

3233
03:49:58,272 --> 03:50:03,227
SAM: Ooh! I go outside immediately.

3234
03:50:03,227 --> 03:50:09,229
MATT: All right. You find the opening, pull
through, and then come through on the opposite side.

3235
03:50:09,229 --> 03:50:16,910
SAM: I bamf out. There's a trapdoor. We've got to
go down the trapdoor. No one's in the house! We

3236
03:50:16,910 --> 03:50:21,106
can just go in, snickety-snack! Let's go in, go
down the trapdoor, see what it is.

3237
03:50:21,106 --> 03:50:23,523
LIAM: There are three of us running in after--

3238
03:50:23,523 --> 03:50:32,898
SAM: No, we don't need them. Let's just go.
They'll make noise! You, me, and you, we're the

3239
03:50:32,898 --> 03:50:34,765
stealthy ones.

3240
03:50:34,765 --> 03:50:40,501
LIAM: That is true, but we don't know what is in
here.

3241
03:50:40,501 --> 03:50:44,151
SAM: Yeah, you're right. We should totally tell
the others.

3242
03:50:44,151 --> 03:50:47,621
TALIESIN: Hello, everyone. What's going on? Are
things going on? Hello?

3243
03:50:47,621 --> 03:50:50,344
LIAM: Scanlan is still grappling with some sort of
depression.

3244
03:50:50,344 --> 03:50:57,839
SAM: I've got a bipolar thing going on,
manic-depressive episode.

3245
03:50:57,839 --> 03:50:59,500
TALIESIN: I don't know what any of that means.

3246
03:50:59,500 --> 03:51:02,859
MARISHA: Is it the spice? Are you having a rough
morning from the spice?

3247
03:51:02,859 --> 03:51:05,760
SAM: Anyway. There's a trapdoor. We should go down
it.

3248
03:51:05,760 --> 03:51:07,005
TRAVIS: Trapdoor?

3249
03:51:07,005 --> 03:51:13,543
LAURA: Did you see any sign of life inside the
house?

3250
03:51:13,543 --> 03:51:18,674
SAM: Yeah, I did. I saw the sign that someone had
opened a trapdoor and gone down it.

3251
03:51:18,674 --> 03:51:21,319
TALIESIN: They could be hurt.

3252
03:51:21,319 --> 03:51:23,340
MARISHA: They could just have a basement.

3253
03:51:23,340 --> 03:51:26,701
LAURA: We could be breaking into somebody's home
for nothing.

3254
03:51:26,701 --> 03:51:33,485
LIAM: We either sit on our asses waiting for this
woman, or we go make shit happen.

3255
03:51:33,485 --> 03:51:35,855
LAURA: We're on a time crunch. Let's make shit
happen.

3256
03:51:35,855 --> 03:51:40,548
TALIESIN: An entire city may die if we take too
long.

3257
03:51:40,548 --> 03:51:44,487
LAURA: Can we look around? Is anyone around? Can
we pick this lock without anybody knowing?

3258
03:51:44,487 --> 03:51:49,202
LIAM: Give my sister and I a minute and then join
us. Oh, we left them way behind.

3259
03:51:49,202 --> 03:51:52,397
MARISHA: Do we have time to go get more slushy
beverages?

3260
03:51:52,397 --> 03:51:55,536
TRAVIS: No, Keyleth. No.

3261
03:51:55,536 --> 03:51:57,911
LIAM: You work on the lock. I'm going to go get
the rest. I'm going to head back.

3262
03:51:57,911 --> 03:52:02,632
MATT: So Vax, you head back. You get the rest of
the party. Vex?

3263
03:52:02,632 --> 03:52:03,968
LAURA: Do I see anyone around?

3264
03:52:03,968 --> 03:52:07,078
MATT: You actually see a couple folks walk by. You
take Scanlan and you guys step into the shadows.

3265
03:52:07,078 --> 03:52:11,915
You wait a minute for them to just pass by, and as
soon as they're out of earshot, you head back.

3266
03:52:11,915 --> 03:52:14,732
LAURA: Can I check for traps?

3267
03:52:14,732 --> 03:52:16,372
MATT: You may. Make an investigation check.

3268
03:52:16,372 --> 03:52:25,502
LAURA: Oh, well. That investigation was a 12,
there.

3269
03:52:25,502 --> 03:52:27,916
MATT: Doesn't appear to be trapped.

3270
03:52:27,916 --> 03:52:32,377
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to pick this lock,
Scanlan.

3271
03:52:32,377 --> 03:52:33,909
TRAVIS: Can we look around the streets?

3272
03:52:33,909 --> 03:52:39,817
LAURA: Yeah, I totally checked already. I'm going
to try and pick this lock. I'm going to try real

3273
03:52:39,817 --> 03:52:41,885
hard. What do I roll?

3274
03:52:41,885 --> 03:52:53,428
MATT: Oh, this would be a sleight of hand. Not
sleight of hand. No, this is a lock-pick tool, a

3275
03:52:53,428 --> 03:52:57,410
thieves' tools check. So you add your proficiency
bonus and your dexterity bonus.

3276
03:52:57,410 --> 03:53:04,194
LAURA: Add my proficiency bonus? I don't
understand.

3277
03:53:04,194 --> 03:53:05,571
LIAM: Thieves' tools.

3278
03:53:05,571 --> 03:53:06,758
LAURA: I have thieves' tools!

3279
03:53:06,758 --> 03:53:09,957
MATT: Your proficiency bonus is five, right? And
what's your dexterity bonus?

3280
03:53:09,957 --> 03:53:13,166
LAURA: Oh, my dexterity is another five.

3281
03:53:13,166 --> 03:53:14,945
MATT: So add ten to your d20 roll.

3282
03:53:14,945 --> 03:53:18,231
LAURA: I think that's a 14 that I rolled.

3283
03:53:18,231 --> 03:53:33,865
MATT: Okay, so plus ten, 24. Oh, four plus ten?
You put your lock pick inside. As simple as it

3284
03:53:33,865 --> 03:53:38,885
looks from the outside, it's a very intricate
lock. You spend about five minutes with it. You're

3285
03:53:38,885 --> 03:53:42,069
not getting any of the tumblers.

3286
03:53:42,069 --> 03:53:48,982
LAURA: Just go inside, unlock it from the inside.
But don't tell my brother I couldn't unlock this,

3287
03:53:48,982 --> 03:53:49,981
okay?

3288
03:53:49,981 --> 03:53:52,128
SAM: Wait, first I'm going to try to pick the
lock.

3289
03:53:52,128 --> 03:53:56,436
LAURA: Do you have thieves' tools? Then go fuck
yourself. You can't.

3290
03:53:56,436 --> 03:53:58,241
MATT: Just roll a d20 and add your dexterity
modifier.

3291
03:53:58,241 --> 03:54:03,314
SAM: Four. All right, I'll just go in there.

3292
03:54:03,314 --> 03:54:09,426
MATT: He pulls out a couple of barely unfurled
pieces of wire, puts them in there for a second,

3293
03:54:09,426 --> 03:54:11,465
and they both break inside of it.

3294
03:54:11,465 --> 03:54:14,431
SAM: All right, I will Dimension Door inside.

3295
03:54:14,431 --> 03:54:24,925
MATT: Okay, you're now inside. As you go back
to the door, you can see there is a heavy latch

3296
03:54:24,925 --> 03:54:28,424
and some sort of a padlock on it.

3297
03:54:28,424 --> 03:54:30,204
SAM: Goddamn it. On the inside?

3298
03:54:30,204 --> 03:54:34,810
LIAM: Have I gotten back to the rest?

3299
03:54:34,810 --> 03:54:39,597
MATT: You have gotten back pretty quick, full
speed. You guys, over the next two minutes or so,

3300
03:54:39,597 --> 03:54:42,107
the rest of the party gets there. You can go ahead
and make another shot. The DC is going to

3301
03:54:42,107 --> 03:54:43,584
increase, though.

3302
03:54:43,584 --> 03:54:47,779
LAURA: I try it again. Natural 20!

3303
03:54:47,779 --> 03:54:53,808
MATT: Very difficult because it is not only a
difficult lock, with the interior padlock, but

3304
03:54:53,808 --> 03:54:58,510
Scanlan broke off pieces of wire in it that are in
danger of permanently breaking the lock and making

3305
03:54:58,510 --> 03:55:02,916
it unusable. You, however, thankfully manage to
maneuver the tools to remove the pieces of wayward

3306
03:55:02,916 --> 03:55:09,510
wire, finish the lock, and as soon as you finish
unlocking the padlock on the inside with a curved

3307
03:55:09,510 --> 03:55:19,565
piece, the door opens, and there's a slight flash.
Nothing.

3308
03:55:19,565 --> 03:55:25,005
LAURA: Oh no. It's an alarm. We need to get the
fuck out of here.

3309
03:55:25,005 --> 03:55:27,668
MATT: No noise. Make a perception check.

3310
03:55:27,668 --> 03:55:34,025
MARISHA: Did we forget to check for traps again?

3311
03:55:34,025 --> 03:55:35,939
LAURA: No, I did. I checked! 16?

3312
03:55:35,939 --> 03:55:41,952
MATT: 16? Ah, as Scanlan from the inside and you
on the outside, you take a quick glance inside,

3313
03:55:41,952 --> 03:55:48,036
just scanning around. You can see bed on the far
side, the trapdoor that's open, the stairs that

3314
03:55:48,036 --> 03:55:53,094
lead down. What catches your eye is right around
the outside of the entrance to the basement, you

3315
03:55:53,094 --> 03:55:58,729
see these dark spots across the ground that
generally fade as they reach the door that you're

3316
03:55:58,729 --> 03:56:08,511
at. These are familiar spots. These are tiny
little spatters of viscera, blood. Dried.

3317
03:56:08,511 --> 03:56:13,683
LAURA: (gasps) Leading from the door to the
trapdoor?

3318
03:56:13,683 --> 03:56:16,529
MATT: Leading from the trapdoor to the door,
dissipating as it comes to your door.

3319
03:56:16,529 --> 03:56:18,937
MARISHA: Wait, and it's dried?

3320
03:56:18,937 --> 03:56:24,568
MATT: It looks like it's been there for a while,
yeah.

3321
03:56:24,568 --> 03:56:28,314
LAURA: Oh shit. So the trap could've done
something to somebody before?

3322
03:56:28,314 --> 03:56:36,829
SAM: No, more blood toward the trapdoor and then
it fades, so someone came out of the trapdoor--

3323
03:56:36,829 --> 03:56:38,587
MARISHA: And tried to haul ass out.

3324
03:56:38,587 --> 03:56:40,095
TRAVIS: What was the flash?

3325
03:56:40,095 --> 03:56:42,140
SAM: An alarm.

3326
03:56:42,140 --> 03:56:47,903
LAURA: Do I see footprints around?

3327
03:56:47,903 --> 03:56:51,681
MATT: As you get close and look down, you can see,
in a couple of the dried blood smears, there

3328
03:56:51,681 --> 03:56:55,655
appear to be footprints in them that are heading
out.

3329
03:56:55,655 --> 03:56:58,891
SAM: I go over to the trapdoor and inspect it for
traps.

3330
03:56:58,891 --> 03:57:01,208
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3331
03:57:01,208 --> 03:57:04,932
SAM: It being a trapdoor, it should have a trap.
17.

3332
03:57:04,932 --> 03:57:10,533
MATT: The trapdoor is still open. It's left open
and the stairs that descend. There is no trap in

3333
03:57:10,533 --> 03:57:16,231
the vicinity. Looks like it's been untouched for a
while. You guys are just now starting to approach

3334
03:57:16,231 --> 03:57:24,455
the outside of the house. As you get there, you
see the door is partially ajar, and it is open,

3335
03:57:24,455 --> 03:57:29,473
and you can vaguely see movement on the inside of
Vex and Scanlan looking about.

3336
03:57:29,473 --> 03:57:31,587
LIAM: Nice job, ace. What's going on?

3337
03:57:31,587 --> 03:57:36,858
LAURA: There was a trap. I think there was a trap
on it and I didn't know. But I looked for traps!

3338
03:57:36,858 --> 03:57:40,232
There was a flash. Does that sound familiar?

3339
03:57:40,232 --> 03:57:43,136
TRAVIS: Is anyone new on the streets or on the
roofs above us?

3340
03:57:43,136 --> 03:57:47,662
MATT: Perception check.

3341
03:57:47,662 --> 03:57:53,452
MARISHA: Can I look down the road, because I'm
down a bit, see if anyone looks like they're

3342
03:57:53,452 --> 03:57:54,569
coming this way?

3343
03:57:54,569 --> 03:57:55,560
TRAVIS: 16.

3344
03:57:55,560 --> 03:57:56,442
TALIESIN: 26.

3345
03:57:56,442 --> 03:57:57,215
MARISHA: 18.

3346
03:57:57,215 --> 03:58:01,465
MATT: Okay. The three of you looking about. There
are some people in the distance that pass by three

3347
03:58:01,465 --> 03:58:06,070
alleys down, but there's nobody paying attention
to or immediately in the vicinity of this little

3348
03:58:06,070 --> 03:58:09,017
alcove. Nothing unusual.

3349
03:58:09,017 --> 03:58:10,853
LIAM: Scanlan's by the open trapdoor inside?

3350
03:58:10,853 --> 03:58:16,222
TALIESIN: I'm going to nonchalantly walk in, open
the door, and just we'll all come in and shut the

3351
03:58:16,222 --> 03:58:17,517
door behind us.

3352
03:58:17,517 --> 03:58:19,366
LAURA: Is there any blood on the inside of the
door?

3353
03:58:19,366 --> 03:58:24,358
MATT: If you look on the inside of the door, there
is actually a hand print in blood against the top

3354
03:58:24,358 --> 03:58:25,388
of it.

3355
03:58:25,388 --> 03:58:29,468
LAURA: Does it look like it was trying to open the
door? Does it look like it got the door open, or

3356
03:58:29,468 --> 03:58:30,894
it was stuck inside?

3357
03:58:30,894 --> 03:58:33,970
MATT: No, it looks like, as it wraps around the
top, it looks like somebody had lifted it up.

3358
03:58:33,970 --> 03:58:36,242
LAURA: Oh, the trapdoor.

3359
03:58:36,242 --> 03:58:43,262
TALIESIN: Is there blood on the handle? Is there
blood on the door itself?

3360
03:58:43,262 --> 03:58:47,323
MATT: Looking at the inside handle, there are very
faint traces of dried blood.

3361
03:58:47,323 --> 03:58:54,167
MARISHA: Can I do a check on the outside threshold
of the door to see if I can see the blood go

3362
03:58:54,167 --> 03:58:55,345
outward?

3363
03:58:55,345 --> 03:58:56,634
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

3364
03:58:56,634 --> 03:58:58,654
LAURA: I go and grab our note that we sent and
take it.

3365
03:58:58,654 --> 03:58:59,906
MATT: Okay, you put it away.

3366
03:58:59,906 --> 03:59:02,060
MARISHA: Nothing, no.

3367
03:59:02,060 --> 03:59:04,728
TALIESIN: I will check for that, too.

3368
03:59:04,728 --> 03:59:11,577
MATT: You guys are out in the open right now,
slowly inspecting the ground in the middle of this

3369
03:59:11,577 --> 03:59:12,782
alley.

3370
03:59:12,830 --> 03:59:16,628
TALIESIN: 11. I'm at the door looking out.

3371
03:59:16,628 --> 03:59:20,046
LIAM: I'm going down the trapdoor carefully.

3372
03:59:20,046 --> 03:59:22,103
MARISHA: Okay, we're all inside, right?

3373
03:59:22,103 --> 03:59:24,913
MATT: Yeah, you're all inside. Vax is vanishing
down the trapdoor.

3374
03:59:24,913 --> 03:59:30,130
TALIESIN: I'm doing a quick, gentle sweep of the
room, looking for any invisible bodies in the

3375
03:59:30,130 --> 03:59:32,329
corner. Just moving my hand around.

3376
03:59:32,329 --> 03:59:42,659
MATT: Okay. As you guys are scanning this, Vax,
you head down into the bottom. Beneath this small

3377
03:59:42,659 --> 03:59:49,234
hovel in this trapdoor, the stairs stop and to the
left of you there is another door that is

3378
03:59:49,234 --> 03:59:51,549
partially left open into another chamber that is
beneath.

3379
03:59:51,549 --> 03:59:54,282
LIAM: I want to look for traps on the door.

3380
03:59:54,282 --> 03:59:55,462
MATT: The door is open, but yeah.

3381
03:59:55,462 --> 04:00:01,376
LIAM: Okay, but there could still be. Okay,
investigation, right? 19.

3382
04:00:01,376 --> 04:00:03,569
MATT: Does not appear to be trapped.

3383
04:00:03,569 --> 04:00:08,758
LIAM: So I'm still stealthed? I'm going to gently
open the door and peer in.

3384
04:00:08,758 --> 04:00:14,566
MATT: You pull it open, look inside. This is a
larger chamber with a much better set of

3385
04:00:14,566 --> 04:00:24,328
furniture. It looks like the woman that you had
hired probably lived here more than above. You see

3386
04:00:24,328 --> 04:00:31,492
what would be weapons racks, but have been cleaned
out. You see a couple of lanterns that are placed

3387
04:00:31,492 --> 04:00:38,468
upon a table in the corner that have since burned
out. One of them has actually fallen over, and it

3388
04:00:38,468 --> 04:00:44,100
appears the glass is broken on the ground. Make a
perception check.

3389
04:00:44,100 --> 04:00:45,572
LIAM: 25.

3390
04:00:45,572 --> 04:00:49,279
MATT: Glancing across the room, you can see more
of the thicker blood spatters with other

3391
04:00:49,279 --> 04:00:59,503
footprints in them. Multiple footprints. You see a
body, still, on the other side of the room.

3392
04:00:59,503 --> 04:01:06,112
LAURA: Oh, somebody else got the Vestige.

3393
04:01:06,112 --> 04:01:14,368
MATT: You come up to the body, and it appears to
be a female form. You see black hair with white

3394
04:01:14,368 --> 04:01:19,007
streaks throughout. Ornate scale mail armor of
black and purple. As you pull her over, the face

3395
04:01:19,007 --> 04:01:28,994
appears to be in her mid to late forties. Her left
eye is ruined and sealed closed with a scar. There

3396
04:01:28,994 --> 04:01:35,304
is a very large pool of drying, coagulated blood
sitting beneath her. Giving a moment to inspect

3397
04:01:35,304 --> 04:01:41,250
her, she is indeed dead and has been for the
better part of a week. Her wounds involve several

3398
04:01:41,250 --> 04:01:45,223
severe puncture wounds throughout her torso.
Multiple stabs, one in her throat.

3399
04:01:45,223 --> 04:01:50,820
SAM: Can anyone talk to her?

3400
04:01:50,820 --> 04:01:52,601
MARISHA: Pike's not here.

3401
04:01:52,601 --> 04:01:55,267
MATT: Are the rest of you guys coming down to see
this?

3402
04:01:55,267 --> 04:02:00,390
TALIESIN: I'm heading down if everybody else is.

3403
04:02:00,390 --> 04:02:05,483
LAURA: I look around. Any evidence left behind of
who it was that attacked her?

3404
04:02:05,483 --> 04:02:09,541
MATT: Investigation checks for the guys who are
checking the room. What are you guys checking?

3405
04:02:09,541 --> 04:02:11,971
LIAM: I'm going to check her further.

3406
04:02:11,971 --> 04:02:16,584
MATT: Investigation check on the body.
Investigation check on the room.

3407
04:02:16,584 --> 04:02:18,218
MARISHA: I want to see if they've turned the
room.

3408
04:02:18,218 --> 04:02:19,892
LAURA: I want to see if I can find something left
behind by the killers.

3409
04:02:19,892 --> 04:02:21,780
SAM: I'm looking for other exits.

3410
04:02:21,780 --> 04:02:25,262
LIAM: 21 on her form.

3411
04:02:25,262 --> 04:02:26,669
TRAVIS: I'm looking for treasures.

3412
04:02:26,669 --> 04:02:30,582
MARISHA: 21 as well, looking at the house.

3413
04:02:30,582 --> 04:02:40,504
TALIESIN: Trying to get a sense of the situation
of the murder, how many people there were.

3414
04:02:40,504 --> 04:02:48,416
Investigation? 13.

3415
04:02:48,416 --> 04:02:54,955
MATT: There's a lot of foot movements, some more
heavy than others. It looks like there was a

3416
04:02:54,955 --> 04:02:58,707
scuffle here, but it's hard to tell how many
people were involved. Definitely more than two.

3417
04:02:58,707 --> 04:03:05,527
What'd you roll? 21? 15? You're having a hard time
finding anything that really specifically

3418
04:03:05,527 --> 04:03:07,749
represents that scuffle.

3419
04:03:07,749 --> 04:03:10,205
LAURA: I bring Trinket out and have him sniff
around.

3420
04:03:10,205 --> 04:03:16,953
MATT: Okay. Trinket begins sniffing around the
room. Keyleth, you find a series of puncture marks

3421
04:03:16,953 --> 04:03:24,784
in the walls themselves, in some of the dirt and
stone parts of the wall, some small stab puncture

3422
04:03:24,784 --> 04:03:27,716
wounds across the wall in different places.

3423
04:03:27,716 --> 04:03:30,077
TALIESIN: Just to be safe, I'm going to close the
trap door.

3424
04:03:30,077 --> 04:03:32,862
MARISHA: Is it dark down here?

3425
04:03:32,862 --> 04:03:37,967
MATT: It is pitch dark. Percy, for the most part,
you don't have any sort of sight--

3426
04:03:37,967 --> 04:03:45,063
MARISHA: Is it safe for me to throw out a Daylight
spell? I throw up a Daylight.

3427
04:03:45,063 --> 04:03:51,868
MATT: The room now illuminates, and you all have a
very clear perspective on this. You, inspecting

3428
04:03:51,868 --> 04:03:55,165
the body, the puncture wounds that are in the
front have corresponding puncture wounds in the

3429
04:03:55,165 --> 04:04:00,137
back as well. You can see clasps on the shoulders
where a cloak would be affixed, but the clasps

3430
04:04:00,137 --> 04:04:03,630
have been broken off and there is no cloak there.

3431
04:04:03,630 --> 04:04:06,401
TRAVIS: Any treasures in the room?

3432
04:04:06,401 --> 04:04:07,924
MATT: What'd you roll for an investigation check?

3433
04:04:07,924 --> 04:04:09,004
TRAVIS: 18.

3434
04:04:09,004 --> 04:04:16,453
MATT: 18? Most of the room has been completely
ransacked. It looks like there were places where

3435
04:04:16,453 --> 04:04:21,523
some things might have been useful, but they have
been taken. You find a couple of discarded jewel

3436
04:04:21,523 --> 04:04:30,076
boxes or lockboxes that have since been broken
open and left with a couple scattered gold coins

3437
04:04:30,076 --> 04:04:33,237
here and there, but this place has been completely
cleaned out.

3438
04:04:33,237 --> 04:04:40,344
SAM: I was looking for other exits and entrances
to the building all around, and I rolled a 29.

3439
04:04:40,344 --> 04:04:52,107
MATT: There looks to be one hidden passage behind
this one cabinet, where all the drawers have been

3440
04:04:52,107 --> 04:04:56,772
pulled out and left on the ground empty, but
behind that there is a small tunnel that exits

3441
04:04:56,772 --> 04:04:57,790
outward.

3442
04:04:57,790 --> 04:04:59,024
SAM: To the street?

3443
04:04:59,024 --> 04:05:03,511
MATT: You don't know. As you're inspecting it,
you're seeing more and more of these, each one of

3444
04:05:03,511 --> 04:05:08,024
these puncture marks that hit the front, also
correspond to the back. It's a clear wound through

3445
04:05:08,024 --> 04:05:11,540
each way and it appears to be a burn around the
outside of each one of these punctures.

3446
04:05:11,540 --> 04:05:17,110
TALIESIN: Well, I haven't looked at them yet, and
there's no reason to look until someone, yeah.

3447
04:05:17,110 --> 04:05:19,310
LIAM: Percival, come here.

3448
04:05:19,310 --> 04:05:25,568
LAURA: Can I have Trinket sniff around for
anything that doesn't smell like her? For other

3449
04:05:25,568 --> 04:05:26,595
people?

3450
04:05:26,595 --> 04:05:30,595
LIAM: Perce? This looks like your work.

3451
04:05:30,595 --> 04:05:35,376
LAURA: Advantage on smell.

3452
04:05:35,376 --> 04:05:38,269
TALIESIN: I take a look at the body.

3453
04:05:38,269 --> 04:05:43,657
MATT: You are very familiar with these type of
wounds. Corresponding to the punctures you've seen

3454
04:05:43,657 --> 04:05:51,480
in the wall behind, you go back, check, and begin
to pry in, and you pull out small, iron balls.

3455
04:05:51,480 --> 04:05:53,792
MARISHA: I pull it out, and I hand it to Percy.

3456
04:05:53,792 --> 04:05:55,918
TALIESIN: Well, that was quick.

3457
04:05:55,918 --> 04:06:02,016
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I guess our girl is back in
our narrative.

3458
04:06:02,016 --> 04:06:05,290
TALIESIN: That's the best case scenario.

3459
04:06:05,290 --> 04:06:23,253
MARISHA: So hang on. Which hand is Ripley missing?
Right hand? What hand print is on the trapdoor? Is

3460
04:06:23,253 --> 04:06:24,604
it a left hand?

3461
04:06:24,604 --> 04:06:25,935
MATT: It's a left hand.

3462
04:06:25,935 --> 04:06:29,080
TRAVIS: How did she even know about this?

3463
04:06:29,080 --> 04:06:36,313
MARISHA: She's been doing a lot of research, and
she's been following our exploits.

3464
04:06:36,313 --> 04:06:39,375
TALIESIN: She's probably spying on me.

3465
04:06:39,375 --> 04:06:41,032
MARISHA: We know she's a huge fan of Percy.

3466
04:06:41,032 --> 04:06:43,053
TALIESIN: Waiting for me to build something.

3467
04:06:43,053 --> 04:06:45,034
SAM: Single Whitestone Female?

3468
04:06:45,034 --> 04:06:56,939
LAURA: Maybe Mistress Asharru wasn't wearing the
cloak. Maybe she happened to hide it down the

3469
04:06:56,939 --> 04:06:58,153
tunnel.

3470
04:06:58,153 --> 04:07:08,690
SAM: I found a secret exit that someone could have
used to come in and kill, or exit after, or maybe

3471
04:07:08,690 --> 04:07:09,885
not at all.

3472
04:07:09,885 --> 04:07:12,992
TALIESIN: Are there exit wounds on the back of the
body as well?

3473
04:07:12,992 --> 04:07:14,939
MATT: There are, yes. Corresponding exit wounds.

3474
04:07:14,939 --> 04:07:16,492
LIAM: I'll walk over to Scanlan. I'm going in.

3475
04:07:16,492 --> 04:07:24,990
MATT: Okay. You guys follow this tunnel. It's a
very small tunnel, and it continues on for a very

3476
04:07:24,990 --> 04:07:27,049
intense period of time.

3477
04:07:27,049 --> 04:07:32,769
LIAM: Trap check! That is a 24.

3478
04:07:32,769 --> 04:07:40,492
MATT: Okay. Keeping your eyes up as you continue
along, you do not find any traps. Eventually it

3479
04:07:40,492 --> 04:07:48,176
comes up and stops. There above, you can see
there's a small series of hand platforms or

3480
04:07:48,176 --> 04:07:52,053
grooves in the wall that lead up to this cylinder
and above you can see a grate.

3481
04:07:52,053 --> 04:07:54,391
LIAM: Start climbing up it.

3482
04:07:54,391 --> 04:08:03,932
MATT: You climb up and push off there. You come
out. Just glancing up very carefully over the

3483
04:08:03,932 --> 04:08:10,438
side, you see an opening into the Suncut Bazaar,
just outside of an alleyway that opens up into the

3484
04:08:10,438 --> 04:08:13,225
rest of the chaos.

3485
04:08:13,225 --> 04:08:16,097
TALIESIN: We need to get the word out and quickly.
We need to find her before she figures out a way

3486
04:08:16,097 --> 04:08:17,386
to return.

3487
04:08:17,386 --> 04:08:19,090
MARISHA: Get the word out about what?

3488
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:20,449
TALIESIN: She's still in this city.

3489
04:08:20,449 --> 04:08:26,534
LAURA: It was over a week ago potentially. She
could be long gone.

3490
04:08:26,534 --> 04:08:31,913
MARISHA: The leader of one of the largest criminal
masterminds is now dead in the city. We have to

3491
04:08:31,913 --> 04:08:34,168
find the murderer. What do we say?

3492
04:08:34,168 --> 04:08:44,404
SAM: How long has the body been here? A week? I'll
talk to my contacts in the underworld.

3493
04:08:44,404 --> 04:08:49,823
MARISHA: If it's a week, Ripley could be
anywhere.

3494
04:08:49,823 --> 04:08:52,120
LAURA: Did Trinket smell anything?

3495
04:08:52,120 --> 04:08:57,664
MATT: Trinket did not, actually. Trinket had a
rough time trying to just get the bearings and

3496
04:08:57,664 --> 04:08:59,592
find anything specific.

3497
04:08:59,592 --> 04:09:01,397
LIAM: I hippety-hop back down.

3498
04:09:01,397 --> 04:09:06,206
MATT: Okay, you head back and join the group.

3499
04:09:06,206 --> 04:09:08,593
SAM: We could at least ask around and see if
anyone has-- But she disguises her appearance,

3500
04:09:08,593 --> 04:09:09,662
doesn't she?

3501
04:09:09,662 --> 04:09:12,344
TALIESIN: She's got a missing arm, though.

3502
04:09:12,344 --> 04:09:15,793
MARISHA: Yeah, but she was able to hide that
before.

3503
04:09:15,793 --> 04:09:20,194
LAURA: The guard at that one place. I feel like it
was her.

3504
04:09:20,194 --> 04:09:21,836
TALIESIN: It's not Ripley.

3505
04:09:21,836 --> 04:09:28,353
MATT: As you guys sit here and contemplate the
various possibilities as to who is

3506
04:09:28,353 --> 04:09:33,697
responsible for this, where they may be, why, and
if they indeed have this Vestige in their grasp,

3507
04:09:33,697 --> 04:09:37,184
we'll end tonight's session there and pick this up
next week.

3508
04:09:37,184 --> 04:09:40,791
SAM: It's a murder mystery now!

3509
04:09:40,791 --> 04:09:55,059
MARISHA: Hold onto those bullets. I might be able
to track her down, because they belonged to her.

3510
04:09:55,123 --> 04:09:58,389
TRAVIS: Nice job, Matt!

3511
04:09:58,389 --> 04:10:02,378
SAM: Nice job creating an entire casino, including
brand new games!

3512
04:10:02,378 --> 04:10:03,800
LAURA: I want to play more!

3513
04:10:03,800 --> 04:10:08,102
TALIESIN: I've figured out how to strategize! Your
dice game has a base strategy, which is only

3514
04:10:08,102 --> 04:10:09,370
double down on a six.

3515
04:10:09,370 --> 04:10:12,918
MARISHA: He's actually right. Then you have a one
in three chance of actually hitting.

3516
04:10:12,918 --> 04:10:14,834
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a seven!

3517
04:10:14,834 --> 04:10:17,524
TRAVIS: All right, okay, it's not real.

3518
04:10:17,524 --> 04:10:23,008
LAURA: I know, but I want to play this game all
the time. I just rolled a seven. I'm counting as a win.

3519
04:10:23,008 --> 04:10:28,498
SAM: We should really go back to this casino and
ask around for Ripley, maybe.

3520
04:10:28,498 --> 04:10:29,921
LAURA: Yeah and then just gamble.

3521
04:10:29,921 --> 04:10:34,632
SAM: Maybe. Just to win favor with the locals.

3522
04:10:34,632 --> 04:10:40,741
MARISHA: I suck with cops. I get thrown out
everywhere I go. It's great.

3523
04:10:40,741 --> 04:10:50,176
LAURA: Yeah, you lawyered her out of jail
before. Thanks, Loot Crate! Don't forget about the

3524
04:10:50,176 --> 04:10:52,090
awesome stuff that's in the store!

3525
04:10:52,090 --> 04:10:55,540
MARISHA: Thanks, Espionage!

3526
04:10:55,540 --> 04:10:56,754
TALIESIN: Oh my god, Espionage, thank you so
much!

3527
04:10:56,754 --> 04:10:57,794
MARISHA: Thank you, nail wraps!

3528
04:10:57,794 --> 04:11:03,059
MATT: And thank you guys for tuning in and
watching our silly game as it gets more chaotic.

3529
04:11:03,059 --> 04:11:07,979
Have a wonderful week, a wonderful weekend, and is
it Thursday yet? See you guys soon.

3530
04:11:08,022 --> 04:17:29,138
