1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,792
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Before we go ahead and jump

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:11,436
into tonight's story, we have some announcements
to get through. First and foremost, tonight's

4
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:14,291
episode is sponsored by our fantastic friends at
Marvel Puzzle Quest.

5
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,718
(cheering)

6
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:24,508
MATT: Indeed. Returning to be awesome fans of the
show and friends and Sam do you have anything to

7
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:25,779
say about that?

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,883
SAM: We love Marvel Puzzle Quest and they love
that we love them. In fact, Puzzle Quest had a

9
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:35,147
bunch of critters come up to their booth at
Gen-con to say hi, and they wanted to thank the

10
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:43,986
community for being so awesome and welcoming. The
game is legitimately awesome. It is so awesome, it

11
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:50,747
is so epic that me talking about it doesn't do
justice. Really it needs another artform. One that

12
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:59,250
is an amazing theatrical experience and expression
of joy and emotion. It needs opera.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,815
MATT: Oh no.

14
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:17,008
SAM: So combining Puccini and Marvel Puzzle Quest,
I give you an operadvertisement. Shit, that music.

15
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:18,479
TALIESIN: Wait!

16
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,287
SAM: No, it's okay. This is going to be terrible
anyway. (singing) The new SHIELD clearance level

17
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:32,779
nine lands today, bro. Better rewards and
challenges you can recruit Lockjaw the inhuman

18
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:42,673
doggo. For more chances to summon Black Bolt,
other Inhumans, and Kamala Khan, and boost the

19
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:53,473
power of your superhero squad. Last but not least,
for a limited time you can also recruit the Silver

20
00:01:53,473 --> 00:02:03,596
Surfer and Thanos and Star-Lord and the cosmic
legends pack. (speaking) Oh shit, I forgot my

21
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:20,113
props. (singing) From now until the 30th of
September. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Marvel Puzzle Quest!

22
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:26,505
(cheering)

23
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:36,172
MATT: Wow! Well done! Thank you, Sam, and thanks,
Marvel Puzzle Quest. It's available for free on

24
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:42,266
the Apple App Store and Google Play. Next up.
Merch, what have we got?

25
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,764
LAURA: We got these.

26
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,532
(cheering)

27
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:49,508
SAM: Hey, how do you say it? Is it Dalen's--

28
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,647
LAURA: It's Dalen.

29
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,904
SAM: Thank you. Jesus.

30
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:59,189
LAURA: Yeah, because you said it wrong. Speaking
of Talks Machina, though-- No, that wasn't Talks

31
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:05,013
Machina. When I announced these shirts on Talks
Machina. My brain. There's a new shirt for Talks

32
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:09,174
Machina. You should check it out in the store.
It's got "Stay Turnt" on it. It's a thing for

33
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,334
Talks Machina.

34
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,416
TRAVIS: Yeah, man. It got Foster in front. Stay
Turnt.

35
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,761
LAURA: 8-Bit Foster!

36
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,991
LIAM: It's cute.

37
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,550
LAURA: Have you seen it, Ashley?

38
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:24,210
ASHLEY: I have, and I may have one. I almost wore
it tonight, but it is in the dirty hamper.

39
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,698
MATT: That's a good reason.

40
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:30,186
LAURA: Also, there's all the other stuff that I
always say.

41
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,878
MATT: Also, Ashley, we miss you.

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,301
MARISHA: We miss you so much!

43
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:38,239
LAURA: Look at that pretty face!

44
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,085
MARISHA: You in your little pink hat! We just love
you.

45
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:56,367
MATT: Okay, next up. (laughs) I regret everything.
No, issue one of Critical Role: Vox Machina

46
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:05,833
Origins is out. Super excited. I'm really proud of
it. Matt Colville did an incredible job.

47
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,529
LAURA: He did such a good job with the dialogue.

48
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:12,336
MATT: I know. Encapsulated the characters,
especially the characters early in their arc.

49
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:20,104
Olivia Samson's art captures the mood and the feel
so well. Chris Northrop's color and his lettering.

50
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:24,416
Everyone did an amazing job on this. If you have
an opportunity to check it out, it's available on the

51
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:29,733
Dark Horse Comics app, through our friends at Dark
Horse or ComiXology and other avenues from there.

52
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,349
Super proud of it, super excited.

53
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:34,692
LIAM: Can I get it on my Zune?

54
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,008
SAM: It's only on PalmPilot.

55
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:41,703
MATT: You can get it on Kindle, Nook, iBooks,
Google Play-- I should have read the list.

56
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:46,059
TALIESIN: I made that list specifically so you
could reference it. That's fine. I do these

57
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,788
things. It's okay. I don't mind.

58
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:54,036
MARISHA: Also, all the updates are on Geek and
Sundry right? Don't tweet the same question 30

59
00:04:54,049 --> 00:05:00,329
times to every member of the cast. Don't do that.
Just look it up on Geek and Sundry. You're going

60
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,042
to get a quicker answer, though, if you look it up
on Geek and Sundry.

61
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:13,532
LIAM: We knew we picked the right people for the
job, but even so, it far exceeded our

62
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,401
expectations. It came together really well.

63
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,500
ASHLEY: It's so good.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,717
LAURA: We've been freaking out.

65
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:26,291
TRAVIS: We've been reading it out loud. Pretending
to be those characters.

66
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,836
MATT: Yeah, Sam hates it, though.

67
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:28,848
SAM: I love it.

68
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:29,890
MATT: Needs more Scanlan.

69
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,625
SAM: It does need more Scanlan. It's a good start.
It's like season one of The Office. Pretty good,

70
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,350
but it gets way better.

71
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,961
MARISHA: American Office or British Office?

72
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,537
SAM: American.

73
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:47,979
MATT: All right, of course we have Talks Machina
next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific Time here on Twitch

74
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,921
and Alpha to discuss tonight's episode. So you can
check it out then with our fantastic host Brian

75
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:53,164
Foster.

76
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:55,789
Laura and Travis, you're going to be at Anime
Weekend Atlanta.

77
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,017
TRAVIS: A.W.A. next weekend. Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday in Hotlanta. Come see us.

78
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:04,185
LAURA: We're going to say hi. What are we doing
there?

79
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:08,488
TRAVIS: We've got panels. We got autograph
sessions. We got chances to take pictures, and eat

80
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:13,533
food, and we're going to run through the quad
streaking.

81
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,089
LAURA: Yeah, he is. I'm going to take pictures.

82
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,014
TRAVIS: Tequila. Yeah, so that stuff.

83
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:25,446
MATT: Fantastic. It is Subtember on Twitch. If you
haven't had enough cash to throw towards subbing to

84
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:29,468
your favorite Twitch channel, for the month of
September, you get half off for doing so. If

85
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:35,026
you're interested in doing that, this is the
month to do it. Go look into it.

86
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:41,007
Last but not least, as many of you are aware in this
string of natural disasters that keeps hitting,

87
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:45,399
there was a terrible earthquake that hit Mexico City and
the surrounding areas this past week. We want

88
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,928
to implore people to do whatever you can to donate
and help those who are currently recovering in

89
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:54,436
the relief effort in the areas that were heavily
hit by this earthquake. Having lived through a

90
00:06:54,436 --> 00:07:01,944
number of earthquakes in my youth, it's a very
scary and very dangerous thing, and nothing on the

91
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:05,828
scale of what they're undergoing there, so if you
have the opportunity, we want to promote UNICEF

92
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:12,977
and Oxfam MÃ©xico. The links will be in the chat
soon, but if you can, please give. It all helps and

93
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:16,956
people who are in the middle of that scenario will
be very thankful. Thank you very much.

94
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:24,216
All right, on that note, let's go ahead and dive
in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

95
00:07:24,216 --> 00:08:54,611
[dramatic music]

96
00:08:54,735 --> 00:09:02,676
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. You guys can
discuss this in a minute. Last we left off, Vox

97
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:08,407
Machina had been climbing their way through the
bowels of an undead risen primordial titan,

98
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:14,213
previously having found information about the
history of Vecna from the Knowing Mistress

99
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:19,622
regarding his ascension, the avatar form, and the
drive he needs to create a miracle before he can

100
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:25,870
truly embody and begin to grow the power to really
exemplify the abilities of the god that he has now

101
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,821
become. You began to make your way through the
interior where you battled corrupted earth

102
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:38,332
elementals that existed in him naturally. You
began to battle undead skeletons and undead

103
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:46,272
trolls. Eventually, after making your way towards
a series of key-trapped rooms, one of which seemed

104
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:53,020
to be some sort of mirrored incinerator, you made
your way towards an upward tunnel and encountered

105
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,624
a number of disciples, cultists of the Undying
King, Vecna.

106
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:03,360
In this confrontation, you encountered
face-to-face a Sphere of Annihilation, and through

107
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,326
some clever uses of short-range teleportation and
losing one's face, you managed to stop them

108
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:17,480
before, one, they destroyed your party, or managed
to escape to alert others of your presence, and

109
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:24,898
last we left off, you all were resting within that
hallway, thinking about what the next course of

110
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,004
action is.

111
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:30,147
So, Vox Machina, what would you like to do?

112
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:33,678
TRAVIS: Cry? Hold each other.

113
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:38,676
MARISHA: So we were going up a tunnel?

114
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:42,335
LAURA: Yeah, we need to keep going up. Oh,
somebody needs to heal Scanlan.

115
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,530
TRAVIS: I think it was the other side of your face
last week.

116
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,591
LAURA: No, it was the same side.

117
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:53,106
LIAM: I palm Scanlan by the face and cast Lay On
Hands. How bad are you, buddy?

118
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,169
SAM: You know, medium.

119
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,523
LIAM: Medium?

120
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:01,631
LAURA: I think it's more like when your toe was
missing. I think it's like that.

121
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:05,323
LIAM: I'm dumping 29 hit points of paladin power
into your face.

122
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,141
MARISHA: Isn't that most of your paladin power?

123
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,312
LIAM: Yeah, it's all but one.

124
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,539
MARISHA: Oh dear god.

125
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,582
LAURA: But what if you needed that?

126
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,268
MARISHA: We've got other people who can do healing
spells.

127
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:18,718
MATT: As he reaches out and his fingers touch the
side of your face, you feel the muscles tighten

128
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:22,626
and the skin begin to reform. As he pulls away,
there's still a little bit of reddish rash or

129
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:27,509
irritation of fresh skin, but the scarring seems
to have subsided and your face is intact.

130
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,092
SAM: Am I handsome again?

131
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,782
LIAM: We like you handsome.

132
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:35,273
TRAVIS: I liked the new way. This is old "I know
this" face.

133
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:39,632
SAM: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm boring. I bore you now.

134
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,175
TRAVIS: Just a little bit.

135
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,283
SAM: I'll get a tattoo.

136
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:43,559
TRAVIS: Okay.

137
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,334
(laughter)

138
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,428
TRAVIS: What are we doing now?

139
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:56,725
LAURA: We need to keep going forward. Either try
to make it up this tunnel, or we can try going

140
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:59,870
down that path that the Sphere was forming. I
don't know what that is.

141
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,514
TRAVIS. It didn't go all the way. It just started.
I looked.

142
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,006
LAURA: Oh, okay. Then we keep going forward.

143
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:07,966
TRAVIS: I think it's a chunnel, actually.

144
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:09,236
LAURA: A chunnel?

145
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,864
TRAVIS: Yep. Small difference.

146
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,132
LAURA: What's a chunnel?

147
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:21,378
LIAM: That's a tunnel that goes under the English
Channel. Wherever that is.

148
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:28,277
LAURA: So forward then, huh? Where's everybody at
health-wise? Are you solid?

149
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:29,614
LIAM: I'm pretty good.

150
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:32,149
TRAVIS: I guess I'm all right.

151
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,782
LAURA: Pike? How are you?

152
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:36,548
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay.

153
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,426
LAURA: You got hit a couple times in that last
fight.

154
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,981
ASHLEY: I did. I think I'm okay, though.

155
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,471
LAURA: All right.

156
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,133
MARISHA: Is this a short rest that we're doing?

157
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,669
MATT: That's up to you guys.

158
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,307
LAURA: That's up to us. We could take 30 minutes
or just keep moving.

159
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,944
TALIESIN: Let's keep moving forward.

160
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:57,480
TRAVIS: Look, I know we haven't said it much, but
Pike, I am glad you are here. I just felt like

161
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,774
saying that.

162
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:06,129
ASHLEY: Me, too. I know we have been here this whole
time, but thank you for instilling confidence in

163
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,468
me yet again.

164
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,882
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

165
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:09,794
ASHLEY: Love you, Grog.

166
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,164
TRAVIS: Love you, Pike!

167
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:17,828
MATT: All right, so you guys are continuing up
the staircase?

168
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:21,575
TRAVIS: Yes. Sneaky fucks in front.

169
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:23,458
MATT: Marching order? All right.

170
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,790
LIAM: Sneaky fucks in front.

171
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,680
LAURA: Should I do Pass Without a Trace, because
they might have some inkling suspicion that we're on--

172
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,476
SAM: How many more of those do you have?

173
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:36,815
LAURA: Well, I've got one level two spell left and
all my level threes. I can cast it at a higher level,

174
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,856
because most of my spells are pointless at this
point.

175
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,457
TALIESIN: I'll go behind the twins.

176
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,551
SAM: I'll go behind Percy.

177
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:50,156
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace.
Everybody's got plus ten to their stealth.

178
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:52,258
TRAVIS: Pike and I got the rear.

179
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:55,560
MATT: Trinket is in your necklace or out now?

180
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,306
LAURA: I'm bamfing him back out.

181
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:59,811
TRAVIS: But we are being sneaky.

182
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:01,918
LAURA: Yeah, but we've got Pass Without a
Trace.

183
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:05,696
SAM: Famous last words.

184
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,510
MATT: Trinket is out and being stealthy.

185
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,476
LAURA: Yes.

186
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:16,272
MATT: Perfect. As you continue up the stone
stairway, you said you were looking for traps? I

187
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,209
figured.

188
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,274
LIAM: Always.

189
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,677
MATT: Slow moving up the steps as you slowly are
looking for-- okay, go for it.

190
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:28,663
LIAM: For traps, for investigations, that is 18.

191
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:35,397
MATT: Okay. You continue up the staircase, the
steps being wider than the previous ones you've

192
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:44,613
seen before. Eventually, you pass through the
carved tunnel of a cave-in up the steps. The next

193
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:52,398
chamber reveals itself naught but 25 feet upwards. It
opens up. You find yourselves standing within a

194
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:59,103
small building ruin, but the walls have fallen
around you. You can see the bare structure around you.

195
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:08,718
Elements of the base floor, rubble and broken
slate. You see around you what must have been a

196
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:13,818
once-colossal courtyard or a commons for the
dwarven city of Thomara, with varying levels and

197
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:19,139
paths and platforms holding rare types of now
petrified leafless trees scattered amongst this

198
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,879
thoroughfare, climbing up dozens of feet like
frozen bolts of lightning forever reaching in

199
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:32,951
vain. You see dead-littered paths, weaving between
stout multi-leveled buildings of Thomara make,

200
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:38,175
corpses that have been torn apart and are
twitching, shifting on their own, the occasional

201
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:44,108
hand pulling its way across. Whatever bits and
pieces of undead here remain, they are not

202
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:49,625
functional. They have been so sundered through the
ages or other sort of confrontation, and yet are

203
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,109
cursed to forever twitch and wander.

204
00:15:52,109 --> 00:16:04,000
Your eyes, as they focus in on this interior, you
glance to the opposite side. You see the ghost of

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,499
this past beauty of the city surrounding you is
now currently defiled on a mass scale. Over half

206
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:17,370
of this 300-foot-wide cavern appears to have
collapsed or is currently crushed under an

207
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:25,208
invading mass of black earth and rock, unlike the
rest of the titan's interior. The familiar smell

208
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:32,253
of wet earth and ancient decay is now mixed with
another familiar scent of cold ash and iron dust,

209
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,794
the smell of the Shadowfell.

210
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:45,969
At this distance, you can see the rough shape of
three carved archways at the base of this inverted

211
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:56,997
mass of earth that curves down and collapses half
of this cavern. About 40 or so feet apart. You can

212
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:02,500
see at each of these entrances, there are some
figures, some shapes. They are too far from you at

213
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,989
the moment, hundreds of feet away from you, to
make any sort of clear vision, but you see a few

214
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:11,610
bits of torchlight in the distance and shifting
shadows near those entrances.

215
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,636
LAURA: Are we in a dark tunnel? They can't see us,
right?

216
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:21,254
MATT: Currently, you guys are emerging from
underneath in this small rubble. There is no

217
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:24,644
light in here. The only bit of light you can see is
some of that bio-luminescent fungus that you had

218
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,407
in that previous tunnel and the torchlight across
the way.

219
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:37,666
LAURA: Should we put out your hands? So that they
can't see us? Well, there's a bunch of people off

220
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,880
in the distance.

221
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,846
LIAM: Want me to go take a look? You've dusted me.
I'm pretty quiet.

222
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,070
LAURA: Yeah, but you have to stay within <i>30</i> feet
of me--

223
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,521
SAM: 30?

224
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:51,629
LAURA: 30 if you want to keep Pass Without a
Trace. 60 to stay within the ring.

225
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:59,577
LIAM: I'd probably be good without it. And we could
go together about 50 feet away from the group, and

226
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,197
then I could go a little bit further and see if I
can get a better look.

227
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,908
LAURA: Let's stick around to the sides.

228
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:05,708
TRAVIS: Vast space? Big, wide open?

229
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:12,181
MATT: It's a wide space. As the cavern opens in
this large, dome-like interior path, loosely

230
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:20,437
kidney bean shaped or a wide oval, half of it is
currently crushed and occupied by this darker mass

231
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,212
of Shadowfell earth.

232
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:27,611
LAURA: It's sitting on top of it? That's the city?
The roots of the city crushing down--

233
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,826
MATT: That's the roots of the city crushing down
into this chamber.

234
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,050
TRAVIS: Could be a Rick and Morty portal to the
Shadowfell.

235
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,124
MATT: Where the titan ends and Thomara begins
would be this particular threshold.

236
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:43,464
LAURA: So we could go up from here? This is where we
go up. You can get that sphere again and tunnel up.

237
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:45,326
SAM: I have the sphere.

238
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,034
LAURA: I know, we go straight into the city.

239
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:50,215
MATT: Well, the sphere is back in the tunnel with
you. You can concentrate on it and bring it with

240
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,509
you and it moves at a very slow speed.

241
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,342
SAM: We haven't moved very far.

242
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,985
LAURA: We've only gone a little bit.

243
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,212
SAM: Sure, I'll bring it as far as we've gone.

244
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:02,515
MATT: Okay. Cool. So what's your intelligence
modifier, again?

245
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:05,598
SAM: Now it's three.

246
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:14,628
MATT: Three? So you can move it 15 feet a round.
It's slower than any of you.

247
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:19,826
SAM: Sure, but we're just walking here.

248
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:26,040
MATT: As you make your way up the tunnels, this
hovering ball of dense death and destruction is

249
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,778
(humming).

250
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:29,008
SAM: Simon Three.

251
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:31,328
MATT: Humming ominously, Simon Three makes its
way.

252
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:32,544
MARISHA: Does it make that sound?

253
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:33,816
LAURA: Is it noisy?

254
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:37,924
MATT: It does give off vibration and a noise to
it. You do hear the subtle hum.

255
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:41,018
LAURA: How far away from it do we have to be in
order to not hear the hum?

256
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:44,309
MATT: About 80 or so feet.

257
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,735
TRAVIS: That's further than I thought.

258
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,511
SAM: It's going to reveal our position, isn't it?

259
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,698
MATT: It's very faint sound.

260
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:52,393
TRAVIS: They are a couple hundred feet away.

261
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,751
LIAM: You still have Silence?

262
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:55,242
TALIESIN: We still have some cloaks.

263
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:56,852
SAM: We can put one on the Sphere?

264
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,281
LAURA: No, put them on us.

265
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,745
SAM: Disguise him! Put him in a hat, gloves.

266
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:08,972
LAURA: I'm going to instantly throw a robe over
top of Scanlan. You've got a robe on you now. I

267
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,934
put a robe on, too.

268
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:14,824
MATT: Okay, so you put on a robe and Scanlan puts
on a robe.

269
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:15,713
LAURA: Yeah.

270
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:16,847
MATT: All right.

271
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,162
TALIESIN: They know that the orb was with two of
the others, so as long as we keep the distance,

272
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:21,629
everything should be fine.

273
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,875
SAM: Oh, so now we're legit.

274
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,270
LAURA: Yeah, we look like we're with them.

275
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,080
TRAVIS: Hey, twins? How do our flanks look if we
move forward? Is it just trees? Is it buildings?

276
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,588
LIAM: I was about to ask. We see flickering light
far away, but I don't trust anything. I want to

277
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:39,679
specifically see if anything besides twitching
fingers and toes are hiding closer to us.

278
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,694
MATT: Make a perception check.

279
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:44,100
LAURA: And I'm listening for voices. Do I hear
anything?

280
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,596
MATT: Perception check.

281
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:46,748
LIAM: 24.

282
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:53,137
LAURA: Oh, 19.

283
00:20:53,137 --> 00:21:00,166
MATT: Okay. Between the both of you focusing in
the still silence, you can hear very faint distant

284
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:06,297
muttering of conversation, briefly, on the
left archway. But around you, aside from the

285
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:14,112
small skittering of an occasional hand that is
crawling its way forward, you don't see any

286
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:18,555
full-bodied undead. In fact, in comparison to the
chamber you'd exited more than an hour ago, which

287
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:24,049
had hundreds and hundreds of wandering undead,
this is mostly vacant of anything that isn't

288
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,697
directly at those archways.

289
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:28,281
LIAM: Which are how far away from us?

290
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:32,026
MATT: They're about 150 or so feet. They're right
at the center part of where the chamber

291
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:37,132
would be, where the earth of Thar Amphala's
current resting place begins.

292
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:43,154
LAURA: We're not within the distance of 80, so
they wouldn't be able to hear the orb.

293
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:47,715
SAM: Okay, great. Send it straight at them, then.

294
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:48,909
LAURA: Definitely.

295
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,153
TRAVIS: (laughing) Super slow.

296
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,801
(laughter)

297
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,003
MATT: Austin Powers it.

298
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:59,544
TALIESIN: It could in theory collapse the arches,
if you were so inclined.

299
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:02,120
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we're in here.

300
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,365
LAURA: We could collapse all the rest of the
tunnels and we go straight up into the city.

301
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,325
TRAVIS: It's a tiny ball.

302
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,262
MARISHA: Sounds a bit like bringing the city to
us.

303
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,747
TALIESIN: How big is the ball, again?

304
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,860
MATT: The ball is about two feet in diameter.

305
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,578
TALIESIN: Grog's not going to fit in that hole.

306
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:19,903
SAM: It could curlicue up.

307
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:23,272
TALIESIN: I don't trust you as a sphere artisan.

308
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:33,048
SAM: But with you by my side, your engineering
wits and my ball-handling skills, we'll be fine.

309
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:35,852
TALIESIN: As legendary as your ball-handling
skills are--

310
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:38,320
TRAVIS: Make a ball-handling check.

311
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,519
TALIESIN: Roll 2d6.

312
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,461
LIAM: I volunteer as tribute!

313
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:49,976
TALIESIN: I don't see how I could possibly help
with this.

314
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:54,261
MARISHA: I'm afraid it might slow us down.

315
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:59,489
TALIESIN: Here's a question, if you start thinking
of it going in a particular direction, does it

316
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,188
keep going in that direction?

317
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:06,291
SAM: Or does it have a radius where it stops
listening to me? Let's give it a shot.

318
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,696
TALIESIN: We could send it in a direction?

319
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,070
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fun.

320
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,673
LAURA: Yeah, let's send it off towards one of
those torches.

321
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:15,514
MARISHA: Destroying everything in its path for
forever.

322
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:16,941
SAM: Let's find out, right?

323
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,569
TALIESIN: Or we could send it straight up.

324
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,516
SAM: I'm going to concentrate on Simon Three and
send it back the way we came. Not hitting

325
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:29,968
anything. Just to see how far it goes before I
lose telekinetic connection with it.

326
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:37,505
MATT: It continues until it's out of sight. So it
starts digging and burrowing--

327
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:38,922
SAM: Is it still going?

328
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:44,490
MATT: As soon as you send it downward at an angle,
it hits the floor and begins carving its own path,

329
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,181
tunneling lower and lower--

330
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:49,173
SAM: How far away is it now?

331
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:52,174
MATT: At this point? I'd say it's about 70 feet.

332
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:53,332
SAM: Okay. Come back!

333
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,868
MATT: It begins to slowly come back in your
direction.

334
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:01,676
TALIESIN: You finally found a worse pet than
Trinket. Well done. I love Trinket.

335
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:05,243
LIAM: By the way, what direction is Vecna from us
now?

336
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:14,279
MATT: Sourcing it would be upwards, at an angle,
from where you see the base of Thar Amphala. It's

337
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,345
in that direction, at an upward angle. You get the
sense that this is near the edge of the city.

338
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:23,727
LAURA: Can we see any light from above us?

339
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:34,249
MATT: Other than the very faint bio-luminescence
left by the little patches of dull orange here and

340
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:40,900
there that give you a sense of the overall
scope and enclosure of the chamber, no other light

341
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,840
source. There's no opening.

342
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,531
LAURA: So the option is really to keep moving
forward and find our way out.

343
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:49,606
TRAVIS: Same option as ten minutes ago.

344
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:57,103
MARISHA: The figures in the distance. Can we tell
by scale how big they are? Do they look humanoid

345
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:58,393
or bigger?

346
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:01,299
MATT: Make a perception check.

347
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,110
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

348
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,356
TALIESIN: To control the sphere, is it just will?

349
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:12,016
SAM: It obeys me because I asserted my dominance.

350
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:16,365
MARISHA: 21.

351
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:28,592
MATT: The left archway, you see two torches being
held by two human-sized figures, humanoid. Hoods

352
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:32,293
are down, but you can't see at this distance
anything beyond the size. They appear to be

353
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:45,291
surrounded by five or more dwarf-size skeletons
that are shambling in unison around them in one

354
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:49,219
uniform movement as they pace around the opening
to the archway.

355
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:57,176
The middle archway, you see another humanoid
figure, but armored. You can see the sharp edges

356
00:25:57,176 --> 00:26:04,536
of plated shoulders and a helmet. And a few other
skeletal figures wandering around, but one. At the

357
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:13,757
very very edge of the one torch that it holds you
see one large hulking figure, about ten or so feet

358
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:16,845
tall. But you only see the very edge; you don't
actually see the rest of the body. All you see is

359
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:19,075
the edge of the shoulder or the beginning of the
side.

360
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:21,815
SAM: That's one way, right?

361
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,014
LAURA: There's three ways.

362
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:35,263
MATT: And then there's the right archway. You can
see three small-ish-looking humanoid figures. Two

363
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:41,799
that are very hunched, on hands and legs. 
Have a humanoid silhouette on the head and

364
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,949
shoulders, but they're down on the ground, almost
like a dog. Between the two of them, there is one

365
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:52,557
humanoid figure that's still hunched slightly, but
still standing upright, hooded and cloaked.

366
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:56,711
MARISHA: Do they appear to be looking for
something? Or are they wandering like a patrol?

367
00:26:56,711 --> 00:27:01,134
MATT: As you watch them for a moment, you see
they do move a little bit, glancing around the

368
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:05,656
area, keeping a watch, but they appear to be
stationed there with a minor patrol in the

369
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:06,898
vicinity.

370
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,683
SAM: Can they see each other?

371
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:13,081
MATT: For the most part. They are about 40 feet
from each other. As there is a curve, the right

372
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,279
and the left archway probably have a hard time
seeing each other. The middle one has a view of

373
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,733
each. Occasionally, they'll interface; they
converse a bit between the two of them. But for

374
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:26,050
the most part they're definitely keeping a look
out. They're very vigilant and looking out into

375
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,630
the empty space before them.

376
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,288
LIAM: Seeing which way Keyleth is looking, Vax stands
a bit on tiptoe and puts his chin on her shoulder

377
00:27:32,288 --> 00:27:36,608
and looks in the distance, and sees the armored
figure. Are we close enough to tell if that

378
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:38,866
armored figure has a sword?

379
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:42,620
TALIESIN: I can lend the scope of my gun, if that
helps.

380
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,736
MATT: Okay, that would probably help. Make a
perception check.

381
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,478
TRAVIS: What is that?

382
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:50,947
TALIESIN: Scope?

383
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:52,053
TRAVIS: Yeah.

384
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,851
TALIESIN: Just a series of lenses--

385
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,055
LIAM: 26.

386
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:58,087
MATT: So this is the central figure in the armor?

387
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,324
LIAM: Yeah.

388
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:06,180
MATT: It's wearing similar armor, not to the
knight you had encountered with Vecna, more the

389
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:14,821
blackened armored knight that you had battled at
the ziggurat on Marquet.

390
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,534
SAM: Wait, what?

391
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:21,561
MATT: When you first encountered Delilah Briarwood
and you found the pathway into the Shadowfell.

392
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:23,106
MARISHA: Is that the same guy?

393
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:26,209
MATT: Well no, you murdered that one. But it's
similar set of armor, yes.

394
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:30,362
TALIESIN: I let Grog look through the scope.

395
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:34,362
TRAVIS: (gasping) They're right here!

396
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:37,239
(laughter)

397
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:41,722
TALIESIN: I regret nothing.

398
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:46,451
MARISHA: (laughing) Ashley's face. Oh no.

399
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:48,488
ASHLEY: Are you scared?

400
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:55,836
TRAVIS: Look through the <i>scoop</i>. Look through it.
What do you see?

401
00:28:55,836 --> 00:29:01,056
ASHLEY: I just see big guys. But I guess everybody
looks big to me.

402
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,137
(laughter)

403
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,739
TRAVIS: Pike's so brave. So brave.

404
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:12,657
LIAM: Through Skype, it's like my niece sat down
at the table to start playing.

405
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:22,841
LAURA: Can we scry on the death knight or on
Delilah to see if they're with Vecna right now?

406
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:28,435
Because if they're separate from him, then what if
they're in these chambers?

407
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:37,011
MARISHA: Yeah. I will use a 5th-level spell to
scry. As opposed to the Scrying Eye. Does my

408
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:40,581
Scrying Eye use my spellcasting ability? No, it's
15.

409
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,608
MATT: It's 15. It's tied to the item.

410
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:45,359
MARISHA: I'm going to scry on--

411
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,468
TRAVIS: Death knight.

412
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:51,185
LAURA: He probably would be less aware. If you
scry on Delilah--

413
00:29:51,185 --> 00:30:01,315
MARISHA: She'll alert people to our presence.
Yeah. That death knight that seems to be the

414
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:03,816
right-hand man.

415
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:07,337
LAURA: We can scry through the ring, right?

416
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,343
MATT: What's the ring say?

417
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:16,343
LAURA: Hold on. I have to find it.

418
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:18,511
TRAVIS: I didn't even think about that.

419
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:21,695
LAURA: Band of Shrouds. While attuned, all
creatures and their belongings within 60 feet of

420
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,723
the bearer are immune to most divine magics that
would locate or reveal the whereabouts of the

421
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,931
creature.

422
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:30,213
MATT: You can scry outside of it, but you cannot
scry into it.

423
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:31,974
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it.

424
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:36,307
LAURA: Most divining magics. That doesn't mean we're
immune to everything.

425
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:43,325
MARISHA: I want to scry on that big guy that was
with Delilah when I saw them walking out.

426
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:45,543
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Armor bro.

427
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,803
MATT: With your spell?

428
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,170
MARISHA: With mine.

429
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,458
MATT: Okay. Hold on.

430
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:55,054
TALIESIN: Matt's finding his murder sheet.

431
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,977
LIAM: How are your magical reserves?

432
00:30:56,977 --> 00:31:05,124
MARISHA: They're all right. I'm using my last
5th-level spell for this.

433
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:18,225
MATT: You back up into the hallway to find a
space that isn't immediately visible and begin to

434
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:24,595
build the circle of incantation. The rest of you
keep watch in case anything begins to make its way

435
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:34,030
toward the entrance. As you complete the ritual, your
vision expands, and you feel your essence being

436
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:42,181
pulled up through the earth and rock, changing
from gray and brown to black and dead, until

437
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:47,749
eventually, for a brief instant, you see a burst
of the city of Thar Amphala, matching precisely

438
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:50,764
your memory of the inner sanctum of the city.

439
00:31:50,764 --> 00:32:02,003
In an instant, there's a rush of momentum and
energy, and you see footsteps. You see before you

440
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:09,637
the death knight that you had previously
encountered in the struggle is stepping up these

441
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:15,604
dark, ruddy stone steps. One, two, three, you can
hear the echo surround you in this slightly

442
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:17,799
curving staircase.

443
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,273
MARISHA: Do I see Delilah?

444
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:32,765
MATT: You do not. Unfortunately, you see a very
vague image of a room that's disappearing behind

445
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:40,497
him as it curves around where you can see two
other armored figures similar to the one that's in

446
00:32:40,497 --> 00:32:47,375
the center archway that are standing watch in that
chamber. They vanish as he curves around, and you

447
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,714
watch as he steps up, step-step-step.

448
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:59,241
MARISHA: Can I get any other details on where he
is? Can I see any other identifying landmarks?

449
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:03,416
MATT: Currently it's a windowless stairway that
curves.

450
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,376
MARISHA: Is he going upwards?

451
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,244
MATT: Yeah.

452
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:09,522
MARISHA: Oh, he's in a tower.

453
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,615
LAURA: Well, maybe. What else does she see?

454
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:24,527
MATT: You see a sudden swelling of greenish-blue
light as he reaches the apex of this staircase.

455
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:35,506
You now see the top of the tower exposed where
three large hooked, stone spires curve inward to a

456
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,154
familiar top of the tower.

457
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:39,712
MARISHA: He's trying to do it again!

458
00:33:39,712 --> 00:33:45,656
MATT: Out of the corner of your eye, you see-- the
sky itself, from this perspective, has this

459
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:54,252
weird sickly blue-green tint to it, and as you try
and focus beyond the proximity of the knight, you

460
00:33:54,252 --> 00:34:07,731
get a glimmer of some shape currently gliding in
the air above. Then a voice says "No," and--

461
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,645
LAURA: You were scrying on the death knight, not
Vecna!

462
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:12,812
TRAVIS: He doesn't know who it's from.

463
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,278
MARISHA: Or where.

464
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:23,071
TRAVIS: He probably detected it, but he doesn't
know who. Or where. Said the barbarian about the god.

465
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:29,515
MATT: Knowing, as you've cast the spell before, a
creature that can see invisible objects sees the

466
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:35,786
sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your
fist. Creatures that can see invisible can see the

467
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:37,432
source of a scry spell.

468
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:39,029
SAM: Can see the source?

469
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:44,227
MATT: Not necessarily, but they can see that
something is scrying on the space. As soon as you

470
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:47,094
kick back you're like, "Shit. That's probably what
it was."

471
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:50,442
MARISHA: Shit, that's probably what it was.

472
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:55,107
LIAM: He knows we're coming.

473
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:58,937
LAURA: There was that moment when you two were
falling to your deaths before we entered the

474
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:04,235
titan. You were away from me, so it's possible
that he knows.

475
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,695
MARISHA: I'm sure he knows we're around.

476
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:10,757
TALIESIN: Do we want to deal with these people or
get around them?

477
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:15,278
LAURA: Do we see any other tunnels that aren't
guarded?

478
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,796
MATT: Make a perception check.

479
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:24,453
LAURA: Whoa. That's a big fat no.

480
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:30,242
MATT: It's real dark, and you have to travel
deeper into the actual cavern space to try and see

481
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:31,879
any other tunnels.

482
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:41,872
LIAM: There's no peeling around the sides of this?
There's too much rubble and shit? This huge space

483
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:43,162
that we're in.

484
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:46,790
MATT: No, it encompasses the entire opposite side
of this. This was at one point a 250- to

485
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:52,971
300-foot-long cavern, but half of it is entirely
occupied by the base of Thar Amphala.

486
00:35:52,971 --> 00:36:00,908
TRAVIS: Couldn't Scanlan look like one of the
mages we killed and walk up and be like, "All

487
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:05,586
"clear, everybody. Go home. It's all done."

488
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,331
LAURA: We can totally try that.

489
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,353
TALIESIN: What was his name?

490
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,342
TRAVIS: He had a name?

491
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:13,273
LAURA: He did have a name. What was the name? You
wrote it down.

492
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:16,918
SAM: The names of the people we killed? We know
their names?

493
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:20,085
LAURA: Yeah, you wrote it down.

494
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:21,216
MARISHA: Odell.

495
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:22,486
LAURA: Odell.

496
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:25,415
MARISHA: Tell Viscon we have visitors. I wrote
that in quotes.

497
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:33,922
SAM: I could be one of them. I have an orb of
destruction next to me that would seem like his.

498
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,536
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could walk it up real close and
be like--

499
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:39,885
LAURA: Be like, we're going to tunnel in this 
one now, so move.

500
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:42,730
MARISHA: Do you remember what Odell looked like?

501
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,997
SAM: Sure. We just killed him, right?

502
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:51,565
MARISHA: Odell seemed to be a more
high-ranking member of Vecna's forces.

503
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:54,603
SAM: Which was the one who was 
controlling the orb, though?

504
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:58,486
LIAM: Wait a second. Scanlan could do that, but he
can't go by himself! We all have to creep along with

505
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,588
him, or be found out.

506
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:01,427
SAM: I won't be alone. I'll have Simon with me.

507
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,297
LIAM: We all have to go together so we don't fall
out of range of her ring.

508
00:37:04,297 --> 00:37:07,838
LAURA: This is true. We're going to be within 60
feet of you, very stealthily.

509
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,277
LIAM: We're all stuck together, unfortunately.

510
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:12,275
TALIESIN: Can you send them down there?

511
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:13,991
SAM: Send who down where?

512
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:19,864
TALIESIN: The rest of them to help the other-- We
tell them they need help down below, in the cavern

513
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:25,440
where we murdered everybody. You're Odell. Viscon
might be one of them. Send them down there to see

514
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,218
if there's a problem, then cave them in when they
all go.

515
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:30,837
SAM: How far are they from us?

516
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:34,763
MATT: They're about 140 or so feet.

517
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:37,273
LIAM: Send who?

518
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:43,132
TRAVIS: The people who are guarding the archways.
We trap them with explosives and shit.

519
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:46,568
TALIESIN: How is it that Grog is following me
right now? Am I making that little sense?

520
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,619
TRAVIS: Always the tone of surmise.

521
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:54,479
MARISHA: How many robes do we have? Are we going
to claim that we're there to relieve them of their

522
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,085
shift? Is that what you're pitching?

523
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:59,012
LAURA: No, we're going to say we're going to
tunnel in that area now, so they have to clear out

524
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:00,790
or else they'll be caved in.

525
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,704
TALIESIN: We send one of us up as Odell to tell
Viscon there's a problem down there and that we need

526
00:38:04,704 --> 00:38:07,040
everybody to help because we found something.

527
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,419
TRAVIS: Yeah, we heard rumblings down there.

528
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:16,915
LAURA: Not people, don't let anyone know there's
people, but there's definitely something

529
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:18,060
interesting.

530
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,314
SAM: But you people have to be near me when I do
this. How is that going to happen?

531
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,889
TALIESIN and LAURA: We're going to hide.

532
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,620
SAM: Is there anything to hide behind?

533
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:33,819
MATT: It's dark, and there are a number of dwarven
buildings in various levels of disrepair and

534
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:35,041
collapsing.

535
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:39,892
LAURA: As we get closer, I can use Hide in Plain
Sight and camouflage all of us to where they can

536
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,722
walk by us and they won't see us.

537
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:45,503
LIAM: Additionally, we can play monkey in the
middle; as long as Vex is in the center you can be

538
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:49,509
50 feet or so ahead, and everyone else can be
either with Vex or back.

539
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:53,764
TRAVIS: Oh, this actually sounds like a plan,
which means it will go terribly.

540
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:58,127
LAURA: They're 120 feet from us?

541
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,116
MATT: 140, 150 feet.

542
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:04,323
LAURA: Okay, we'll move forward a bit, and then I
can camouflage all of you.

543
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:11,775
SAM: Wait, an actor prepares. Who am I? What's my
motivation? Am I Odell? If so, why does Odell have

544
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,089
the sphere with him?

545
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,481
LAURA: Because he's going to tunnel in that
tunnel.

546
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:22,277
TRAVIS: Look, Odell went to Vecna because his wife
left him because she's like, "Oh, you're not very

547
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:27,390
"powerful." And he's like, "I will find and show
you power." So you went to Vecna and you gouged

548
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,647
your eye out. But then your depth perception is
off now. So then you're like, "I'm going to work

549
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:34,547
"my way up through the ranks."

550
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:39,819
MARISHA: But then you went back and she was like, "Now
you're hideous. Now I'm not taking you back at all!"

551
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:44,129
And you were spiteful, so you went back and
turned to a life of crime and deceit.

552
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:49,944
SAM: Sure, I'll show her. I'll show all of them! I
like this. Good backstory.

553
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:51,892
TRAVIS: Pike, smack Scanlan. Let him know.

554
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:56,692
ASHLEY: I smack him on the butt. Go get them.

555
00:39:56,692 --> 00:40:02,072
SAM: Wait. Who's Viscon? Which one is he?

556
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:07,402
LAURA: Odell was the one holding the sphere,
right?

557
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:14,124
MARISHA: Yes. Because one of the other minion guys
was like, "Odell, go tell Viscon."

558
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,885
SAM: Yeah, but he was running away. He wasn't the
one holding the sphere.

559
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:19,414
LAURA: Odell wasn't holding the sphere.

560
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,823
SAM: It was the green robe guy.

561
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:24,330
MARISHA: Who's the green robe guy, then?

562
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:29,868
LAURA: Gray. Yeah, it was gray. Hold on, I pull it
out and look at it. Yeah, it was gray.

563
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:36,214
SAM: Wait, we have the actual robe? Just give me
that.

564
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:38,986
MARISHA: Are they written on the tags like a
school play?

565
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:42,281
LAURA: Yeah, does it have his name written in it
anywhere so he keeps track of it?

566
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:45,120
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

567
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:49,581
SAM: Property of Jimmy.

568
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:54,018
LAURA: Oh, this is pretty good. 24.

569
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,906
SAM: "If found, return to--"

570
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,838
MARISHA: "Property of--"

571
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,055
MATT: This is which one?

572
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:05,073
LAURA: This is the gray robe.

573
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:07,151
SAM: I thought green!

574
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:09,116
LAURA: It was gray, the guy that was controlling
the orb.

575
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,913
MARISHA: You know these people have
anal-retentiveness issues.

576
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:16,481
LAURA: No! The red guy was holding the orb. The
green guy put up the force wall and ran away.

577
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:17,702
SAM: So we want the red?

578
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:19,207
LAURA: The red robe. I'm looking at the red robe.

579
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:21,534
MARISHA: Because the red robe was Odell.

580
00:41:21,534 --> 00:41:24,019
LAURA: I don't know! We don't know.

581
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:34,784
LIAM: Vax starts quietly praying to the Raven
Queen in a corner right now.

582
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:41,254
MATT: Odell is the one that ran off.

583
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:45,760
LAURA: Okay, so that's not the one we want; we
want the one in red that was controlling the orb.

584
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,597
MATT: Viskorad.

585
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:53,376
SAM: Did we ever hear his name?

586
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:58,125
MATT: Yes. "Turn back and tell that Viskorad found
sneaky prey."

587
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:02,595
SAM: Viskorad. My name is Viskorad.

588
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:04,651
TRAVIS: Do you want to know his backstory?

589
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,574
(laughter)

590
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,081
SAM: I'll just use the same one.

591
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:12,711
MARISHA: Viskorad and Viscon are two different
people?

592
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,522
MATT: I might have mis-said it at the moment. I
was on painkillers.

593
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:20,111
MARISHA: So there is no Viscon, there's a
Viscorad.

594
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:23,186
MATT: Viscon I think is the name of an island
elsewhere.

595
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:27,231
(laughter)

596
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:31,135
TALIESIN: He's looking forward to vacation when
this is all over.

597
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:35,390
SAM: We know the other one was named Odell and
he's dead. So I can go over to them and say,

598
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,399
"They've killed Odell."

599
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:41,375
LAURA: No, don't say that there's anybody that
they need to watch out for. Don't set them on

600
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:46,376
alert! No, tell them you found something
interesting and Odell is investigating it.

601
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:48,653
SAM: So they need to go get what?

602
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,728
LAURA: They need to go down into the tunnel to
help him.

603
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:54,011
SAM: Okay, but what is the thing that we found?

604
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:56,749
TALIESIN: Anything you'd like.

605
00:42:56,749 --> 00:43:01,597
MARISHA: Your long-lost wedding ring from your
past marriage.

606
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:09,602
TALIESIN: Not that, but yes. We found something
interesting. It's strange, possibly dangerous,

607
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:10,931
possibly useful.

608
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:14,845
LAURA: You definitely need help for it. Vecna's
going to be thrilled! Everybody's going to get

609
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,392
promotions.

610
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:24,067
SAM: Odell is still down there. He needs some
help. I'm going to go talk to Vec while they go

611
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:35,437
help Ode. Right? I'm going to put on my Hat of
Disguise and become as close to that man's form as

612
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:38,482
I can. Wait, was he a human? Was he an elf?

613
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,898
MATT: He's human.

614
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:41,168
SAM: He was human?

615
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:47,871
LAURA: So we sneak forward. Trinket's going back
into his necklace. It's too dangerous, buddy.

616
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:52,064
SAM: Moles and trolls. Red leather, yellow
leather.

617
00:43:52,064 --> 00:44:02,073
LAURA: So as soon as we get within a hundred feet of them
I'm going to do Hide in Plain Sight on everybody

618
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,410
and camouflage everybody so that they--

619
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,518
MATT: Okay, so Hide in Plain Sight and
camouflage.

620
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:13,826
LAURA: On top of Pass Without a Trace. Hide in
Plain Sight.

621
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:16,196
TRAVIS: We could hide in a house, one of the
ruins.

622
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:20,154
MARISHA: We've got camo paint and camo clothes,
while carrying a bush.

623
00:44:20,154 --> 00:44:22,971
MATT: Hide in Plain Sight is the camouflage you're
referring to.

624
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:30,820
LAURA: Just to disguise everyone so that they're
super hidden.

625
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,915
TRAVIS: Pike can get on my back.

626
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:37,661
MATT: Camouflage you can really only do on
yourself.

627
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:43,030
LAURA: I can use my ranger skills to cover
people!

628
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:47,499
MATT: Sure, you can Arnold-Schwarzenegger-in-Predator 
this for other folks.

629
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:51,054
LAURA: We're keeping within Pass Without a Trace.

630
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:52,905
MATT: I'll say make a wisdom check.

631
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:54,724
LAURA: To see if I can actually do it?

632
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:58,339
MATT: To see how well you manage to mask the
terrain nearby.

633
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:00,965
LIAM: I stand ten feet away from her and give her
a plus two. Oh, that's so low.

634
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,652
LAURA: I know. Eight.

635
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:03,765
LIAM: Plus two!

636
00:45:03,765 --> 00:45:09,554
LAURA: Oh, a wisdom saving throw or a check?

637
00:45:09,554 --> 00:45:16,709
MATT: A check. It looks like, unfortunately, the
shale and broken rock in this vicinity, it's hard

638
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:23,360
to find anything that would actually help hide
them, beyond their natural stealth roll. So you're

639
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,690
going have to rely on your Pass Without a Trace.

640
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,700
LAURA: So we have to stay within 30 feet of me.

641
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,269
TALIESIN: We'll stay in there. We're going to get
into the ruins and have our guns trained in case

642
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:34,508
anything goes wrong.

643
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:38,291
LAURA: Scanlan, stay within 60 feet of me.

644
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:45,269
MARISHA: Keyleth finds some black dirt on the
ground and gives a war paint.

645
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:48,713
TALIESIN: Remember, if anything goes wrong, it's
been a pleasure working with you.

646
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:52,213
SAM: Wonderful. We have the jenga. We can do the
jenga!

647
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:54,620
TRAVIS: You're the only one who'll be saying
jenga, pretty much.

648
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,394
LAURA: Yeah, you can do the jenga. What do we do
if it's jenga?

649
00:45:58,394 --> 00:46:00,103
SAM: We kill everyone.

650
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,477
TALIESIN: We think well of you and move on.

651
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:09,110
LIAM: I'm going to stick close to Vex in case she
needs backup, but also if Scanlan needs backup.

652
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,708
Ready to run in.

653
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:17,635
ALL: Okay.

654
00:46:17,635 --> 00:46:19,617
MATT: The only person going forward is you?

655
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:20,893
SAM: Yes.

656
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:27,110
MARISHA: Wait! Before he goes, I grab him, and I
cast Freedom of Movement on him. You can't be

657
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,503
grappled.

658
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:32,936
LAURA: Can you cast something to help his charisma
and his persuasion?

659
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:39,537
MARISHA: Yes, actually, I can, because Freedom of
Movement is not a concentration spell. So I'm

660
00:46:39,537 --> 00:46:43,716
going to burn my last 2nd-level spell and do
Enhance Ability to give you--

661
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:46,172
MATT: Advantage on charisma checks?

662
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:50,532
MARISHA: Peacock's Charisma or whatever the fuck
it's called.

663
00:46:50,532 --> 00:46:52,780
MATT: Note you have Freedom of Movement. How long
does it last? Is it an hour?

664
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,064
LAURA: An hour.

665
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:59,345
MATT: So you have Freedom of Movement for an hour.
Everyone else who's not going forward, make a

666
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:01,179
stealth check, please.

667
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:03,620
LAURA: It's plus ten!

668
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:10,427
MARISHA: Let's do the druid dice. Oh yeah,
that's good!

669
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:14,511
LIAM: Natural 20. 47.

670
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:19,400
SAM: You're going to be in triple digits soon.

671
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,879
TALIESIN: He appears in another game. Somewhere in
Deep Valley.

672
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:31,532
MATT: You go back and watch previous episodes, and
Liam's not there. It's really weird.

673
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:40,523
LIAM: Somewhere in the future, there's an
Acquisitions Inc. game going, and my head pops in

674
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:43,074
from the side, and then pulls out again.

675
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:46,887
MATT: I love it. Perfect.

676
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:48,197
LAURA: I got 43.

677
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:49,865
LIAM: That's pretty good.

678
00:47:49,865 --> 00:47:51,173
TRAVIS: 22.

679
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:52,630
MATT: Pike?

680
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,918
ASHLEY: 20!

681
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,815
MATT: Keyleth?

682
00:47:55,815 --> 00:47:57,850
KEYLETH: 32.

683
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,222
TALIESIN: 34.

684
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:10,630
MATT: Wow. That's some pretty solid rolls, guys.
You all stay as quiet as possible, moving along

685
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:17,147
the exterior of Vex's ability to move forward. You
move forward slowly while keeping Scanlan in

686
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:23,163
sight. You slowly begin to move forward, with
Simon Three humming slowly in front of you.

687
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:25,139
SAM: I am going to limp as I go.

688
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:27,441
MATT: Interesting character choice.

689
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:32,690
SAM: Strong choices, commit to them a hundred
percent.

690
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:44,073
MATT: You guys are quietly stepping through, and
you hear his footfalls echoing, and immediately

691
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:49,259
you see some of the torches shift, and there's
some talk and some whispering back and forth and a

692
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:55,721
small shout. You watch as some of the skeletal
entities at two of the entrances shift and look in

693
00:48:55,721 --> 00:49:00,082
that direction, and begin to shamble slowly. The
two torch-bearers on the right begin to move

694
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:06,627
forward as the armored figure in the center
watches on, arms crossed. What are you doing? You

695
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,012
have three archways.

696
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,437
SAM: I go to the one that had that knight near it,
right?

697
00:49:11,437 --> 00:49:12,692
MATT: That's the middle one.

698
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:19,729
SAM: I'll go to the middle one. I'm going to keep
the ball in front of me to obscure me a little

699
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:27,014
bit. Not dead in front of me, but it's up here,
just in case. Hanging my head a little bit. I'll

700
00:49:27,014 --> 00:49:38,738
go up and say: Power! So much power! I've never
experienced anything like it before! Come! I need aid!

701
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:42,647
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

702
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:51,797
SAM: Okay, first one was better. Ten, plus-- what
is this?

703
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:53,578
TALIESIN and MATT: Deception.

704
00:49:53,578 --> 00:49:55,383
SAM: 28.

705
00:49:55,383 --> 00:50:04,563
MATT: The shambling skeletons to the left of you,
you can hear the scraping and clacking sound as

706
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:08,431
their bones rattle and shift across the stone
floor, pieces of rock being pushed as their feet

707
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:15,325
drag across the stone dwarven walkways. The two
torch-bearing, cloaked figures you can see

708
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:20,502
approaching, and they're talking amongst themselves.
One of them is currently holding some sort of a

709
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:25,331
holy symbol in their hand, and they're starting to
glow a bit. They're glaring forward. The armored

710
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:33,577
figure with the arms crossed puts a hand out like
this. They both look over and stop and hold in

711
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:44,184
place. The armored figure steps forward. You can
hear the armored footfalls across the stone. The

712
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:51,304
rot behemoth, which you now see emerging behind.
Rot behemoth, the entities you saw patrolling Thar

713
00:50:51,304 --> 00:50:56,638
Amphala and two of them stormed into Sprigg's
house, begins to follow behind him.

714
00:50:56,638 --> 00:51:00,886
SAM: So far it's going great, guys.

715
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:06,811
MATT: Every minute or two, you have the vibrating
footfall of the titan, and a few of the rocks fall

716
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:11,817
and tumble from the ceiling, and a bit of dust
begins to get knocked free from the high-up

717
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:13,804
ceiling of the cavern.

718
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:19,283
The armored figure approaches, gets within about
15 feet of you and stops. You see no face. This is

719
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:25,187
Magneto-style; there's space for the eyes and the
mouth, but it's too shadowed for you to make any

720
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:32,623
features out. It's this dark void. You can see the
hooked, spiked shoulders and the horns built to

721
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:38,841
come out of the sides of the helmet. Arms still
crossed before. "What did you say?"

722
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:50,729
SAM: We were tunneling with the orb, and we found
something. An ancient, dwarven artifact. It bends

723
00:51:50,729 --> 00:52:01,994
reality. It changed things. It changed my voice!
It changed my whole world for a moment. It's still

724
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:06,168
down there. Odell needs help!

725
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:16,964
MATT: There's a pregnant pause, a stillness that
causes the back of your neck to grow warm. The

726
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:21,325
nerves begin to creep up the back of your spine.
Instinctually, your eyes begin to glance at the

727
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:30,827
two other archways as you see shapes shifting.
The armored figure gives a subtle chuckle, "Very

728
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:35,345
"well. Lead us to this find."

729
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:44,975
SAM: I have been injured. Take the orb, go down to
where we were, down that way. I will go get help

730
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:50,385
for myself. Odell needs you to help him contain
the power.

731
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:58,833
MATT: The head retracts slightly, confused and a
bit worried. He takes one step onto the back foot,

732
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:05,178
almost like it's not sure if it should be close to
you or not. It raises its hand back towards the

733
00:53:05,178 --> 00:53:13,554
two other torch-bearing, cloaked figures and goes,
"Vislal, take the orb." One of the hooded figures

734
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:21,228
steps forward and takes a moment and concentrates.
The orb jolts towards him immediately and he

735
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:29,256
yelps. He's going to try again. Okay. With a
second try, you can see the sweat on his brow as

736
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:36,864
he begins to step backward, like, "I'm not really
good with this." Are you relinquishing your

737
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:37,954
control over it?

738
00:53:37,954 --> 00:53:39,130
SAM: Yes.

739
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,881
MATT: So then he focuses for a moment, and the
orb-- you can feel the slight bit of will that you

740
00:53:43,881 --> 00:53:50,008
had imposed over it has pulled back. The orb
begins to push forward slowly in his direction of

741
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:56,816
choice. You can see a smile come across his
hairless, older face. He nudges the other figure,

742
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:02,204
which you can see is a female half-orc who looks
heavily scarred across the chin and the side of

743
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:05,869
the neck, and they're both missing the
corresponding eye.

744
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:11,462
They both begin to move forward and slowly push
the orb past you. The vibration you hear getting

745
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:18,879
louder in your guys' direction as the armored
figure begins to follow suit behind. The rot

746
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:28,112
behemoth begins to follow, and the armored knight
goes, "Keep watch." The skeletons begin to move

747
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:33,537
backward with the rot behemoth. Now you have the
heavy footfalls of the large, looming rot behemoth

748
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:40,858
in the center walkway and a handful of skeletons
for that approach, blockading that, as the knight,

749
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:46,095
with the two other hooded figures, begin to make
their way towards the entrance where you guys rose up.

750
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:48,305
LAURA: You shouldn't have given them the Sphere.

751
00:54:48,305 --> 00:54:50,527
SAM: What am I going to do with a fucking Sphere?

752
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:53,333
LAURA: Yeah, but we have to cave it in, and
they're going to see.

753
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,032
SAM: Wait, we're supposed to cave in shit?!

754
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:56,272
LAURA: We're going to cave it in after them.

755
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:58,099
SAM: Goddamn it, why didn't you tell me this
plan?!

756
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,708
LAURA: We did.

757
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:09,853
MATT: So they begin to walk forward and slowly
make their way towards the staircase that you guys

758
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,090
emerged from.

759
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,875
SAM: I'm not the best at this game.

760
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,461
LIAM: So we part, like the sea.

761
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:30,372
MATT: You guys part a bit, move around the sides.
Okay. You guys keep as quiet as you possibly can.

762
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:43,757
There's a brief moment, Pike, where your arm is on
the side of one of the stone walls, and a piece of

763
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:52,987
rock snaps and breaks to the ground. One of the
figures with the hood back stops for a second and

764
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:57,750
goes to look, just as one of the titan footfalls
impacts and the whole area shakes sending other

765
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:06,099
rocks tumbling around. It seems to be just enough
to distract. They continue walking forward. You

766
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:16,787
hear the hum of the orb as it slowly makes its way
past you, faint hint of a Doppler. You watch them

767
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:20,575
descend into the ruins that you emerged from, down
into the tunnel.

768
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:23,665
TALIESIN: So they can only move at the speed of
the orb, since they have the orb with them.

769
00:56:23,665 --> 00:56:26,993
SAM: Well, they can move faster, but they won't
have the orb with them.

770
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:30,629
LAURA: Should we still cave it in, though, behind
them?

771
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:33,030
TALIESIN: How many creatures are left guarding
us?

772
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:40,105
MATT: Currently, you still have the cluster of
eight skeletons on the left one. There are four

773
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:44,841
skeletons and the rot behemoth in the middle, and
on the right, you still have one humanoid figure

774
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:48,421
flanked by two hunched humanoid figures.

775
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:54,126
LAURA: We can definitely take the skeletons out,
though, and sneak through, potentially, in that

776
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:59,440
one tunnel. We should still cave this shit in, and
it'll seem like a natural cave-in, right?

777
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,357
MARISHA: Skeletons we can handle pretty easily. So
wait, it's 12 skeletons, one rot behemoth, and two--

778
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:09,018
SAM: Don't you think the thing that the big thing
is guarding is the better path?

779
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:11,154
LAURA: Probably.

780
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:16,129
MATT: There are eight skeletons on the left path,
four skeletons and the rot behemoth in the center,

781
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:19,571
and then one humanoid figure with two crouched
humanoid figures on the right.

782
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:22,569
MARISHA: One humanoid, two crouched figures.
Okay.

783
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:25,009
LIAM: How spread out are those three groupings?

784
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:30,278
MATT: They're about 40 or 50 feet from each other
around a curved outcropping. From your

785
00:57:30,278 --> 00:57:34,376
perspective, it's around this. The center can see
both; the right and left probably can't see each

786
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:39,545
other too well. It's dark and there's a vanishing
point around the curve where the far ends can't

787
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:40,969
make eye contact.

788
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:42,145
TALIESIN: Humanoids are the big problem.

789
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:44,773
TRAVIS: But they can both see the middle?

790
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:46,430
MATT: They can both see the middle, yeah.

791
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:51,160
MARISHA: Out of all of these, the human with the
two crouched things is what I'm most worried

792
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,256
about.

793
00:57:52,256 --> 00:57:54,351
TRAVIS: Because we don't know what it is?

794
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:56,525
MARISHA: Well, and humans have common sense.

795
00:57:56,525 --> 00:58:02,116
TRAVIS: Do we have a way to alienate these three
that are walking to go see Odell? Do we, or do we not?

796
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:03,905
TALIESIN: We have the gem.

797
00:58:03,905 --> 00:58:05,863
TRAVIS: But we don't know what it does.

798
00:58:05,863 --> 00:58:08,720
TALIESIN: It may make the undead move towards it.

799
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,524
LAURA and MARISHA: That's true.

800
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:15,148
LAURA: But should we cave in this fucking tunnel
so that they can't come back through?

801
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:17,609
MARISHA: How wide are the tunnel entrances?

802
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:24,338
MATT: They're about 12 feet wide and about ten
feet tall. And when I say they're arches--there's

803
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:30,254
simple stone placed and then built around to
maintain an arch, but they've been fairly recently

804
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:35,140
constructed and it's more like the very basic
beginnings of a mine shaft. It looks like these

805
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:40,588
tunnels were carved probably once Thar Amphala
arrived above the titan. So they're not extremely

806
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:43,410
stable, but they're stable enough for passage in
and out.

807
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,372
SAM: The guy who talked to me, is he still here?

808
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:48,002
MATT: He went with the orb.

809
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:50,249
SAM: Okay. Which archway did he come from?

810
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:51,569
LAURA and MATT: The middle.

811
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:58,312
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go up to the middle one
and say: Excuse me, big fellow. I have to get by.

812
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:03,837
MATT: Make a deception check. With advantage
still.

813
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:07,317
LAURA: Don't go too far from me!

814
00:59:07,317 --> 00:59:08,657
SAM: 25.

815
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:18,081
MATT: 25? The rot behemoth glances at you. You see
its large metal cage-like helmet that guards its

816
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:24,139
sunken head that rests squarely in the center of
its chest at this point. The smell emanating from

817
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:32,178
it is this awful combination of rot and
long-putrid milk. You can see no face behind the

818
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:36,980
mask, just glowing red coals for eyes. As it
watches you as you pass, it doesn't make any

819
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,311
motion.

820
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:41,610
SAM: I'm going to go in through the archway.

821
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,806
LAURA: Don't keep walking fucking away from me!

822
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:47,321
SAM: I'm going to go a few feet in. Do I see
anything?

823
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:51,249
MATT: You can see it seems to curve upward.

824
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:52,562
SAM: It's stairs?

825
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:59,070
MATT: It's not stairs. It looks like the interior
of this was made with a Sphere of Annihilation,

826
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:05,943
like someone had taken a while-- because there's
no dirt, there's no mounds of dirt around it. It

827
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:10,981
looks like someone had been carefully carving this
path. You get the sense this sphere has been a

828
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:13,751
utility object since they arrived.

829
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:18,437
SAM: How far can I get before I'm away from 60
feet?

830
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:20,262
MATT: You have no idea where she is.

831
01:00:20,262 --> 01:00:24,319
SAM: Well, I must have gone with them and then
gone forward.

832
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,953
MATT: Well, they have to follow you.

833
01:00:25,953 --> 01:00:28,690
LAURA: Every time you move forward, I have to move
forward.

834
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:35,316
SAM: Well, you better fucking move forward. No,
I'm at the threshold of the entrance.

835
01:00:35,316 --> 01:00:38,936
MATT: You walk about three feet past the behemoth
and stop.

836
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:44,358
SAM: I take a knee. (groans)

837
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:46,927
MATT: It slowly turns towards you.

838
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:51,146
SAM: I'm okay, I just need a second. (whispering)
What's going on?

839
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:55,968
TALIESIN: Move the behemoth away.

840
01:00:55,968 --> 01:01:01,935
SAM: What's going on with my brain? (groans)
What's the plan?

841
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:06,523
TALIESIN: Move the behemoth <i>away</i>!

842
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:19,074
SAM: Okay, you can do this, man. Stand up.
(whispering) Lead him away? Where?

843
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:25,441
LIAM: Convince it that the people we sent away
need it.

844
01:01:25,441 --> 01:01:38,891
SAM: I'll start back. I go back through and I say:
No, it's too dangerous. They need help down there.

845
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:49,096
I fall down to one knee again, and say: Ugh! Damn
these legs! You must go help them! They'll die

846
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:53,384
down there! Can't you see it's getting worse?! The
pain!

847
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:59,513
LIAM: Is that the DM's face, or the creature's?

848
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:00,866
MATT: Probably both.

849
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:02,879
(laughter)

850
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:14,281
MATT: Make a straight charisma check. You have
advantage because of the spell. You would.

851
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:17,220
SAM: Just charisma?

852
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,615
MATT: Just charisma bonus; charisma modifier.

853
01:02:19,615 --> 01:02:21,904
SAM: 23.

854
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:30,233
MATT: Okay. That's all you're going to leave it
at? 23?

855
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,815
LAURA: You can inspire yourself!

856
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,809
SAM: Wouldn't it seem odd if I started singing to
myself?

857
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:37,990
LAURA: What if you're crazy?

858
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,316
TRAVIS: You're in a fever dream.

859
01:02:39,316 --> 01:02:42,635
TALIESIN: I can assist in your inspiration.

860
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:45,009
SAM: How? You're 60 feet away from me!

861
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:47,779
TALIESIN: Can I assist in his inspiration?

862
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:51,271
MATT: Anything you do to assist will reveal you
from stealth.

863
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,321
TALIESIN: Including casting a spell?

864
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:54,744
MATT: Oh yeah.

865
01:02:54,744 --> 01:03:08,701
SAM: Sure, I'll inspire myself. Why not? Oh, I get
to roll something.

866
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,178
MATT: Roll a d12 and add that to your 23.

867
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:13,487
SAM: Ooh, another eight!

868
01:03:13,487 --> 01:03:25,097
MATT: Eight onto that? So a 31. There's another
long pause. Generally, an entity like this is

869
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:32,078
tethered to the will of one creature. In most
circumstances, it would not take any orders from

870
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:41,061
anybody outside of it. But somehow, your words get
it to consider in its simplistic, undead mind that

871
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:47,436
if its master is in danger, then obviously the
master would want help.

872
01:03:47,436 --> 01:03:50,340
SAM: That's robotics law one, right?

873
01:03:50,340 --> 01:04:05,286
MATT: Somehow, your force of words circumvent the
tethered command, and the behemoth begins to

874
01:04:05,286 --> 01:04:13,713
hulkingly make its way, with the four other
skeletons, walking with the skittering of the

875
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:17,197
skeletons, away, towards where its master
disappeared.

876
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:27,781
LAURA: I'm going to wait until it passes by me to
whisper into my earring. (whispering) Maybe if we

877
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,880
all go down the middle tunnel, then we can
collapse <i>that</i> tunnel behind us.

878
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,018
MARISHA: Instead of collapsing three tunnels?

879
01:04:35,018 --> 01:04:40,510
LAURA: Yeah. We make a run for it and then
collapse the tunnel. Because the other two tunnels

880
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,207
are going to see us once we get in the middle.

881
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:51,005
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, I'm into this. Do people have
abilities to make sure these people stay back and

882
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:53,325
don't rush us while we get through?

883
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:55,048
SAM: They're idiots. Just go!

884
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:57,047
MARISHA: But there's a person thing.

885
01:04:57,047 --> 01:04:58,711
LAURA: We stealth around the other side.

886
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:04,314
MARISHA: Yeah. Because the skeletons are better to
deal with.

887
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:09,236
TRAVIS: Are you talking about collapsing the
middle tunnel?

888
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:10,966
SAM: That we're about to go into.

889
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:20,202
TRAVIS: Should we entertain the idea of collapsing
the tunnel that we sent everybody to? But all the

890
01:05:20,202 --> 01:05:23,465
danger, the majority of it, is behind us.

891
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:26,372
TALIESIN: We can stealth-kill these humans super
quick.

892
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:30,046
LAURA: Can you collapse the one they went down?
Then we'll collapse ours, too. Because the thing

893
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,375
is a Sphere that can--

894
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:37,782
TRAVIS: Even if you can just get the one. All of
them coming back or chasing us is going to be a

895
01:05:37,782 --> 01:05:42,165
bitch. Even if it just slows them down.

896
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:46,223
MARISHA: This is all pretty much unworked stone
for the most part? Since you said it was all

897
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:50,426
self-carved. It's pretty rough.

898
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:58,143
MATT: Yeah, it's natural earth and stone. As
natural as the Shadowfell's slate and rock is.

899
01:05:58,143 --> 01:06:00,062
It's unworked, for the most part.

900
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:09,109
MARISHA: I could go earth elemental, go into the
walls, collapse tunnel A. You guys make a run from

901
01:06:09,109 --> 01:06:16,914
it. I can earthglide through the walls, get to the
middle as soon as you guys get through, and

902
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:23,847
collapse second tunnel. But it might take a little
bit. I don't know.

903
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,963
SAM: What about the 60-feet thing?

904
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:29,466
TALIESIN: We have to wait for the first wall to
collapse, then we may run.

905
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:32,456
TRAVIS: Make a run for it?

906
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,781
MARISHA: And I'll collapse tunnel one?

907
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,657
LAURA: Collapse tunnel one.

908
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:45,515
MARISHA: How far away is tunnel one right now?

909
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:47,954
MATT: Tunnel one, the one with the eight
skeletons--

910
01:06:47,954 --> 01:06:50,491
MARISHA: No, the one we came from.

911
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:58,513
MATT: Oh, that one! With you guys having to keep
at the 60-foot radius with Scanlan, it's about 80

912
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:01,216
or so feet behind you.

913
01:07:01,216 --> 01:07:06,162
LIAM: Another option: you said that these three
passageways, they curve this way, and that the two

914
01:07:06,162 --> 01:07:11,060
on the sides don't have a really good look at each
other, right? On the left is a bunch of undead

915
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,862
fuckers, right? And on the right we've got a
humanoid and two little crunched over guys, right?

916
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:27,788
So you've got that Silence doohickey, and us. So
we could bet it all on stealth-kills, and creep in

917
01:07:27,788 --> 01:07:35,489
and go. Leave it all behind. One in the middle's
now empty. One on the left over around the corner

918
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:36,738
is undead.

919
01:07:36,738 --> 01:07:38,367
SAM: Who are you going to stealth-kill?

920
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:44,041
LIAM: Humanoid and two creepy-crawly guys. If it
pans out, we take them out, and the skeletons over

921
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:47,782
there can't see over here. If we are quick, and
then we go!

922
01:07:47,782 --> 01:07:50,645
TALIESIN: Well, I would say collapse the tunnel,
then go.

923
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:52,347
LAURA: We still have to collapse the tunnel.

924
01:07:52,347 --> 01:07:56,679
LIAM: All right. But kill them, and then make a
loud noise. Because as soon as we start shit

925
01:07:56,679 --> 01:08:00,341
rumbling, everybody gets paranoid and upset.

926
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:02,427
TALIESIN: We'd have to be lucky.

927
01:08:02,427 --> 01:08:07,755
SAM: They're probably getting down to Odell at
this point. We should hurry!

928
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:14,252
MARISHA: I can throw up a wall of stone to block
the tunnel we came from, and then we go and we do

929
01:08:14,252 --> 01:08:15,452
the other stuff.

930
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:17,279
LAURA: Let's do it and go!

931
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,537
MARISHA: <i>Okay</i>! I'm burning the last of my shit!
6th-level spell Wall of Stone!

932
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:26,030
LAURA and MARISHA: The tunnel we came from.

933
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:30,285
MATT: So you create a stone over that entrance?

934
01:08:30,285 --> 01:08:34,074
LAURA: Yes. Once they're all in there, we block
them in.

935
01:08:34,074 --> 01:08:35,664
MARISHA: We block it up completely.

936
01:08:35,664 --> 01:08:37,204
TRAVIS: If they're all in there.

937
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:42,745
MATT: Yeah, they've all been in there for about
two minutes, at this point.

938
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:49,102
LIAM: Can we say that the twins and Freddie have
been ready to go as you cast and make our move on

939
01:08:49,102 --> 01:08:51,119
these three on the side?

940
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:53,941
MATT: Sure. Are you going for the three
humanoids?

941
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:55,247
LIAM: Yes.

942
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:58,432
LAURA: Are you sure? Those seem like the most
powerful ones.

943
01:08:58,432 --> 01:08:59,975
TALIESIN: That's why we stealth-kill them now.

944
01:08:59,975 --> 01:09:02,187
LIAM: Stealth-kill them and get the drop.

945
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:05,630
LAURA: So after that's up, we all move as a group
in that direction so we're within 60 feet of each

946
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,150
other.

947
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:12,845
MARISHA: Well, my spell is going to make noise,
right? Should you guys stealth-kill first?

948
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:14,770
TALIESIN: We could go for surprise kill if we
want.

949
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,557
LIAM: That's what I'm saying.

950
01:09:16,557 --> 01:09:21,894
MATT: So you're waiting for them? You hold off.
You talk. You guys move over stealthily.

951
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:26,157
MARISHA: I stay with them as far as I can.

952
01:09:26,157 --> 01:09:28,403
MATT: They don't seem to notice your approach.
Just the two of you?

953
01:09:28,403 --> 01:09:31,133
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm at great distance.

954
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,681
LAURA: What do they look like from this distance?

955
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:39,728
MATT: You see there's one hooded figure, hood up,
holding a torch with one hand, but the torch is up

956
01:09:39,728 --> 01:09:44,639
above, so the shadow cast, you're not really able
to make out any features or so. You can see the

957
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:52,317
faint side of an older female face. That's all you
can make out. And you see two shadow ghasts, the

958
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:57,670
creatures that you saw leaping from rooftop to
rooftop in Thar Amphala, and one of them you

959
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:04,996
captured briefly at Sprigg's house. They're both
on chained necklace-like chokers, being held in

960
01:10:04,996 --> 01:10:07,223
the other hand of this individual, like dogs.

961
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:10,465
LAURA: So we should kill her.

962
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:18,737
LIAM: I guess I'll start with her, then the
ghasts. I'm going to assassinate this woman.

963
01:10:18,737 --> 01:10:20,843
Hopefully. Flick-flick on her.

964
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,391
MATT: Roll an attack. Both of you guys.

965
01:10:22,391 --> 01:10:29,472
LAURA: Wait, is it an automatic crit because it's
surprise?

966
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:31,049
LIAM: Yes.

967
01:10:31,049 --> 01:10:35,629
LAURA: Sweet! So 30 for attack.

968
01:10:35,629 --> 01:10:42,843
MATT: 30? Awesome. Why is my music not working? 30
definitely hits. For you, Vax?

969
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:45,591
LIAM: That's 25 and 23.

970
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:47,353
MATT: All hit.

971
01:10:47,353 --> 01:10:57,610
LIAM: Here we go. I'm going to dump a smite into
it, as well.

972
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:13,628
LAURA: 19 times two is 28 plus eight is 36 damage
on my first arrow.

973
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:15,462
MATT: All righty.

974
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:19,006
LAURA: Second attack.

975
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:22,258
TRAVIS: 19 times two? Is what?

976
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:37,289
LAURA: No, 38. 19 times two is 38 plus eight. 46!

977
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:39,318
MATT: There you go, 46 damage.

978
01:11:39,318 --> 01:11:43,125
LIAM: First dagger to strike does 88.

979
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:51,899
MATT: So the humanoid figure in the center holding
the torch, all you see is them drop back to the

980
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:56,620
ground as the chains clank to the ground. The
torch clatters, and you see the light shift and

981
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:02,929
flicker. The two shadow ghasts immediately look
in your direction.

982
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:07,689
LAURA: Yep. That was one, so for my second
arrow--

983
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:13,696
MATT: Then the wall of stone goes over and covers
the top. And you start catching up to the rest of

984
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:18,163
the group? Grog, Pike? You're running to catch up
with Vex and Vax? You're making the second

985
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:19,408
strike?

986
01:12:19,408 --> 01:12:21,498
LIAM: Yeah, I threw two daggers as part of the
surprise.

987
01:12:21,498 --> 01:12:24,289
MATT: Go ahead. This is against which
shadow ghast, the left or right?

988
01:12:24,643 --> 01:12:26,235
LAURA: I'm going left.

989
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:28,877
LIAM: You fired? To the left or the right?

990
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,992
MATT: You don't know.

991
01:12:31,992 --> 01:12:34,652
LIAM: I'm going to fire at the same one that my
sister does.

992
01:12:34,652 --> 01:12:36,147
LAURA: So 31 to hit.

993
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:39,795
MATT: All right, that hits. What'd you roll, Vax,
to hit?

994
01:12:39,795 --> 01:12:47,782
LIAM: It was earlier I did it. They both hit; it
was 20-something.

995
01:12:47,782 --> 01:12:50,535
LAURA: 19 on the left.

996
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:56,190
LIAM: Just seven for me, though, and that's all
I'm going to do.

997
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,924
MATT: All righty. Then you are shooting?

998
01:12:57,924 --> 01:13:04,669
TALIESIN: First one is 32 to hit.

999
01:13:04,669 --> 01:13:06,030
MATT: That hits.

1000
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:23,914
TALIESIN: Second shot is 28 to hit. First shot is
terrible! It's 12 points of damage. I don't have

1001
01:13:23,914 --> 01:13:26,919
surprise bonus at all, do I?

1002
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:31,893
MATT: No, because at this point they've already
been made aware.

1003
01:13:31,893 --> 01:13:39,123
TALIESIN: Second shot is-- oh my god, what a
terrible roll! Ten points of damage. Nope, I'm so

1004
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:45,468
sorry! That's not nearly as bad as I thought it
was. 16 points of damage. That's way better. That

1005
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:47,590
seven looked like a one.

1006
01:13:47,590 --> 01:14:01,514
MATT: Yeah, that's enough. Second shot destroys
most of the upper body of the shadow ghast on the

1007
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:10,500
left. The loud gunshots going off in the cavern
echoes, and you see the skeletons beginning to

1008
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,702
shift from the other hallway toward the direction
the gunshots came from.

1009
01:14:14,702 --> 01:14:16,937
TALIESIN: I'm booking it.

1010
01:14:16,937 --> 01:14:25,851
MATT: As you guys are rushing up, you manage to
catch up to the rest of them as the final shadow

1011
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:34,182
ghast (snarls), and it only sees currently the two of
you. It's going to run forward and it's going to

1012
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:45,900
move here. Even at its full distance, it gets
right up next to you, but it's not going to be

1013
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:50,684
able to attack unfortunately. It uses its full
movement and runs toward you with an unnatural

1014
01:14:50,684 --> 01:14:56,991
speed and it leaps and lands on you with its claws
grabbing your chest and you begin to fall back and

1015
01:14:56,991 --> 01:14:58,635
start to catch yourself.

1016
01:14:58,635 --> 01:15:00,230
LIAM: Stab! Stab! Stab!

1017
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:07,136
MATT: Go ahead and make your attacks. The rest of
you manage to catch up to the group.

1018
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:11,934
TALIESIN: Running up to the center tunnel.

1019
01:15:11,934 --> 01:15:14,569
MATT: Everyone else running up to the center
tunnel?

1020
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:16,139
MARISHA: Center tunnel. Go!

1021
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:21,732
MATT: As you guys approach, you hit the tunnel and
begin to move inside as eight skeletons begin to

1022
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:23,349
curve around the corner.

1023
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:25,605
MARISHA: Are we all in?

1024
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:29,870
MATT: No, currently she's still being assaulted by
a shadow ghast.

1025
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:38,173
SAM: I'm still at the door, and I'll say: No! Get
away from me, you interlopers! Evil-doers! That's

1026
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:40,815
right, you infiltrator! (screams)

1027
01:15:40,815 --> 01:15:48,492
MATT: Perfect! You're stabbing at the guy that's
got her?

1028
01:15:48,492 --> 01:16:05,557
LIAM: 40 for the first. Second one is a seven. No,
it's 17 for the second one, and the last is a

1029
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:09,194
crit, and that is eight.

1030
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:16,831
MATT: That'll do it, actually. As you repeatedly
jab your dagger into the back of it, its tongue is

1031
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:21,279
lashing out and its claws are trying to sink into her
armor. Can't seem to find any purchase on her

1032
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,911
flesh. The horrible smell of its breath is on you
as you watch as dark blood spatters out of its

1033
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:31,432
mouth on you as it's being stabbed to death on top
of you. The weight pushes you onto your back, and

1034
01:16:31,432 --> 01:16:36,312
you crumple onto the ground as it goes limp. You
have to shove it off of you.

1035
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:41,237
LIAM: I take Whisper and the venom dagger and lift
it by the head off her.

1036
01:16:41,237 --> 01:16:42,859
LAURA: Thanks.

1037
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:47,490
MATT: As you guys are getting up to do this
action, the rest of you made it up to the tunnel,

1038
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:51,219
and you can see as the eight skeletons begin to
turn around the corner and begin hacking at the

1039
01:16:51,219 --> 01:16:57,429
slowest who's there, which is going to be Pike. So
Pike, you get four skeletons that are able to

1040
01:16:57,429 --> 01:16:59,266
attack you at this entrance way.

1041
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:00,938
ASHLEY: That's okay.

1042
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:05,154
MARISHA: She's got this shit. She's a cleric!
She's a monster.

1043
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:16,646
MATT: 13 misses. Misses. Misses. They all miss!
They're scratching at your armor.

1044
01:17:16,646 --> 01:17:19,031
ASHLEY: I'm almost there!

1045
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:21,494
MATT: You guys run past the skeletons?

1046
01:17:21,494 --> 01:17:24,988
LAURA: Yeah because we're going to tunnel this
shit anyways, right?

1047
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:27,276
TALIESIN: I think we're going to all get in and
then, Grog, I'm going to have you punch the

1048
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,567
darkness.

1049
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:29,870
TRAVIS: Sure.

1050
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:36,676
MATT: All right so you guys all continue to run
in. As you guys run past, Pike, four attacks of

1051
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:39,126
opportunity on you from the ones that were
attacking you.

1052
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:46,622
15. No. No. 17, no. What's your armor class?

1053
01:17:46,622 --> 01:17:47,925
ASHLEY: 23.

1054
01:17:47,925 --> 01:17:59,235
MATT: 19, it rolled naturally, plus four equals
23. One has managed to finally get to you. It

1055
01:17:59,235 --> 01:18:04,615
swings up with its shortsword at you, and you take
eight points of piercing damage. One of the

1056
01:18:04,615 --> 01:18:11,336
skeletal shortswords strikes across the back of
your armor. It glides off and catches you in the

1057
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:16,390
edge of the ear and you're like (yelps). But you
guys continue to run into this. Are you running

1058
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:17,640
with them?

1059
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,652
ASHLEY: I want to attack them so bad, but I know
we need to go.

1060
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:25,818
SAM: I'll run, but I'll say: No! No, don't take me
with you. I need to stay here.

1061
01:18:25,818 --> 01:18:28,049
TALIESIN: You're our hostage now!

1062
01:18:28,049 --> 01:18:35,816
MATT: As you're shouting this to skeletons, you
glance off over the back of your shoulder and you

1063
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:44,118
see a bit of torchlight emerge as a black orb
burns through a stone wall.

1064
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:46,270
MARISHA: Let's go!

1065
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:56,069
TRAVIS: I wait until everybody's through, and do I
see a crack or nice weakened part in the archway

1066
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,980
that I can smack?

1067
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:04,122
MATT: Make an investigation check. You put your
hand through to find a specific place--

1068
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:07,588
TRAVIS: Hold onto your butts. 13.

1069
01:19:07,588 --> 01:19:09,687
MATT: 13? Maybe.

1070
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:15,291
TRAVIS: I like the maybe. I rear back and hit the
fucking shit out of it.

1071
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:17,794
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll.

1072
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:25,181
TRAVIS: Reckless. That's nice. 24.

1073
01:19:25,181 --> 01:19:28,277
MATT: 24, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1074
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:30,506
TRAVIS: What do I roll? 1d4?

1075
01:19:30,506 --> 01:19:32,951
MATT: 1d4 with the gauntlets then add your
strength modifier.

1076
01:19:32,951 --> 01:19:38,074
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a one. Nine.

1077
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:43,526
MATT: All right, as you slam your fist into the
wall, part of it breaks and cracks and you can see

1078
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:49,146
earth begin to fall and filter in and it's not
enough to take it down. You can hear multiple

1079
01:19:49,146 --> 01:19:51,944
skeleton voices and you see a bunch of them
rushing up the hallway at you.

1080
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:54,030
LAURA: Can I shoot the skeletons that are
approaching?

1081
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:55,276
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot, as well.

1082
01:19:55,276 --> 01:19:58,454
MATT: Okay, both of you guys take fire. Throw your
second punch.

1083
01:19:58,454 --> 01:20:04,209
LAURA: 26 and 27 to hit.

1084
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:07,798
TALISIEN: 25 and 28.

1085
01:20:07,798 --> 01:20:09,286
MATT: All hit.

1086
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:12,207
TRAVIS. 12, 24.

1087
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:19,746
MATT: 24 points of damage? Right. As you guys all
fire and begin to prepare your weapons, you strike

1088
01:20:19,746 --> 01:20:27,426
with your arrows, with your gun blast, with your
daggers as the top of the cavern caves in,

1089
01:20:27,426 --> 01:20:33,064
swallowing whatever projectiles you were throwing,
as well as closing off the entranceway. You can

1090
01:20:33,064 --> 01:20:38,152
see now, as it falls forward, parts begins to
shift.

1091
01:20:38,152 --> 01:20:39,740
MARISHA: Run!

1092
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:44,204
TRAVIS: I pick up Pike, and we start running.

1093
01:20:44,204 --> 01:20:48,479
MATT: Okay. So you're grabbing Pike by the back of
the armor and you guys are rushing. It is starting

1094
01:20:48,581 --> 01:20:56,951
to collapse and fall behind you. At that moment,
you feel the low sub-vibration of another

1095
01:20:56,951 --> 01:21:04,692
titan footfall. At that point, it sends the rest of
this cavern into a more rapid collapse. As you can

1096
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:10,137
hear the cracking sound of the rocks behind you,
Grog, make a dexterity saving throw.

1097
01:21:10,137 --> 01:21:12,786
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those. It's okay.

1098
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:15,925
LIAM: If we're all running together he gets plus
two from me, if he's within ten feet.

1099
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:18,761
MATT: You guys are probably a little bit higher up
than him.

1100
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:20,565
TRAVIS: 17.

1101
01:21:20,565 --> 01:21:27,754
MATT: 17? As you're moving forward and you're
rushing, some of the rocks begin to slam into you.

1102
01:21:27,754 --> 01:21:37,974
Both you and Pike suffer seven points of
bludgeoning damage. The impact of rocks-- make an

1103
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:40,120
athletics check.

1104
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:46,210
TRAVIS: 23.

1105
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:53,041
MATT: Yeah, the rocks begin to collapse around you
and they begin to pin your body, but the physical

1106
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:58,739
strength you have manages to break through and you
are not held in the collapsing tunnel beginning to

1107
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:04,641
push forward. You all begin to rush. Slowly the
sound of the collapsing tunnel subsides as you

1108
01:22:04,641 --> 01:22:10,293
begin to glance upward and see the color of
green-blue light approaching.

1109
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:13,617
SAM: Approaching us? Or we're approaching it?

1110
01:22:13,617 --> 01:22:25,517
LAURA: We can see the sky and we're causing the
collapse behind us? We're up at Thar Amphala? Can

1111
01:22:25,517 --> 01:22:28,488
we slow down at all, or do we have to keep booking
it to avoid the cave-in?

1112
01:22:28,488 --> 01:22:30,397
MATT: Make a perception check.

1113
01:22:30,397 --> 01:22:35,953
LAURA: 18.

1114
01:22:35,953 --> 01:22:43,104
MATT: It sounds like the crumbling noises have
begun to subside, and all you can hear now is the

1115
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:52,503
slow resting and easing to existing loose rubble
and rock, the slow clattering behind you.

1116
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:54,016
LAURA: So we can slow down.

1117
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:56,850
MATT: You guys can slow down. You're about 15 feet
from the surface at this point.

1118
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,842
TALIESIN: Very carefully see what's up there and
find some cover.

1119
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:04,886
LAURA: I still got Pass Without a Trace because I
didn't cast Hunter's Mark.

1120
01:23:04,886 --> 01:23:12,651
SAM: Who are you people? What do you want with
me?

1121
01:23:12,651 --> 01:23:16,553
TRAVIS: I reach over to Scanlan, and I rip his
hair off.

1122
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:19,974
MATT: You reach out, and your hand passes through
nothing.

1123
01:23:19,974 --> 01:23:24,756
TRAVIS: That is a great hat.

1124
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:31,451
LIAM: I got a new 45 stealth check, so I'm going
to go peek. We're level 19. I'm level 19, y'all.

1125
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:48,638
MATT: You peek up past the edge. The sky above you
glows a sickly teal color as the darkened storm

1126
01:23:48,638 --> 01:23:54,559
above is obscured by the crackle of the arcane
barrier that encases the city. Glancing at the

1127
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:59,399
size of the barrier and the points of origin, you
can see that only the inner portion of Thar

1128
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:06,937
Amphala is here. The inner wall and everything
within. The outer regions were left in the

1129
01:24:06,937 --> 01:24:10,059
Shadowfell when it was transported.

1130
01:24:10,059 --> 01:24:16,777
Peppered shifting shapes of winged, black clusters
of creatures scan the sky above. Dozens and dozens

1131
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:22,638
of gloomstalkers seeking any sight of intruders
across the enclosed atmosphere of this arcane

1132
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:31,452
dome. In the distance, you can see the terrible
spire of Entropis standing once more. A web-like

1133
01:24:31,452 --> 01:24:36,628
network of greenish energy fork like veins across
the exterior to hold the structure firm.

1134
01:24:36,628 --> 01:24:46,018
A muffled boom is heard. You glance up, and see
from the outside of this dome an explosion burst

1135
01:24:46,018 --> 01:24:52,314
across the magical barrier. Harmless, then
dissipates. Squinting hard, you can make out

1136
01:24:52,314 --> 01:24:59,084
obscured shapes of wyvern riders. Swarming and
circling the outside of the barrier.

1137
01:24:59,084 --> 01:25:09,496
LAURA: Is there any city on the way to
Vasselheim?

1138
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:16,884
MATT: Well, you traveled with wyvern riders. You
don't know how many there are. But do note that

1139
01:25:16,884 --> 01:25:22,057
you did travel with wyvern riders. Tossing
occasional weapons that bounce off and shatter

1140
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:27,639
with sparks across this barrier. Nothing is coming
through and they're trying to find a weak point

1141
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:32,703
somewhere of what is encasing this. Currently, no
help to you in your circumstance.

1142
01:25:32,703 --> 01:25:40,718
You see a massive skyship hovering far above
that's unable to do anything and is staying far

1143
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:45,187
enough out of reach to not unfortunately fall.

1144
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,503
LAURA: We have to get these shields down.

1145
01:25:47,503 --> 01:25:52,649
MATT: You catch a flashing glance of a huge winged
beast streak across the top of the barrier: a

1146
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:59,250
glittering brass dragon. An arcing blast of arcane
energy fires from the barrier, striking J'mon Sa

1147
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:05,489
Ord, who briefly jolts from the impact, but barely
changes course to curve away and out of sight.

1148
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:12,405
As your vision now begins to focus down to the
city around you, you can see the mostly intact

1149
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:17,654
buildings you recall from your last jaunt through
Thar Amphala. The interior of the city is less

1150
01:26:17,654 --> 01:26:20,742
war-damaged from past history frays.

1151
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:30,548
Here you stand, and here's where we're going to
take a break. We'll return here in a few minutes.

1152
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:38,756
We have a video at the break to get you guys ready
for the Wyrmwood giveaway. Once again, help out

1153
01:26:38,756 --> 01:26:46,249
with the earthquake recovery in Mexico if you can.
And we'll see you guys in a few minutes.

1154
01:26:46,249 --> 01:50:38,789
[break]

1155
01:50:38,789 --> 01:50:47,525
MATT: Welcome back, everybody! And welcome back,
Ashley! Welcome back! We have our winner of the

1156
01:50:47,525 --> 01:50:56,039
Wyrmwood giveaway: Pharadar! P-H-A-R-A-D, what looks like
an A or an O? Possibly an E? R! You are the

1157
01:50:56,039 --> 01:51:00,417
winner! Danoba will contact you and get your
information so we can send you your awesome signed

1158
01:51:00,417 --> 01:51:03,309
Wyrmwood piece of accoutrement! Congratulations!

1159
01:51:03,309 --> 01:51:13,381
All righty. Coming back into the game, folks. As
you all are waiting in this tunnel that emerges

1160
01:51:13,381 --> 01:51:21,208
into Thar Amphala proper, Vax has taken a visual
scope of the surroundings and the current

1161
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:24,547
circumstance. What do you do?

1162
01:51:24,547 --> 01:51:29,444
LAURA: Vax? Does it look like anyone has noticed
the noise coming from this tunnel?

1163
01:51:29,444 --> 01:51:34,442
LIAM: I was about to assess that. Couple of
questions: One, how far is the tower from where we

1164
01:51:34,442 --> 01:51:35,875
are right now?

1165
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:44,216
MATT: You guys are maybe 150 feet or so from the
edge, so you're toward the side of the city. The

1166
01:51:44,216 --> 01:51:51,006
tower is in the very center, so it's maybe half a
mile from you. It's not half a mile; half a mile

1167
01:51:51,006 --> 01:51:58,806
is ridiculous. No, it's maybe 400 feet from you?

1168
01:51:58,806 --> 01:52:04,398
LIAM: Am I able to tell, if this is a giant,
domed-in city, are we in a little corner of it, or

1169
01:52:04,398 --> 01:52:07,530
are we coming up somewhere mid-range?

1170
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:13,232
MATT: If you were to look out at it from an
overhead circle view, from the center, you're a

1171
01:52:13,232 --> 01:52:16,224
little ways near the edge.

1172
01:52:16,224 --> 01:52:17,580
LIAM: Okay, so not right against it?

1173
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:20,240
MATT: Yeah, you're about 150 feet from the edge.

1174
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:24,448
LIAM: How close are the nearest of the
gloomstalkers flying around?

1175
01:52:24,448 --> 01:52:30,694
MATT: At this point, looking up, you see about
three or four that are maybe 70 or 80 feet above

1176
01:52:30,694 --> 01:52:37,103
you. But they're doing passes. They're not being
stationary and they're constantly circling

1177
01:52:37,103 --> 01:52:42,929
through. As you glance up and look and nudge away,
you can see their yellow eyes piercing from their

1178
01:52:42,929 --> 01:52:49,923
black, lightless form. Their wings, as they expand
and shift, you can see that faint glance, the

1179
01:52:49,923 --> 01:52:55,862
beams of their vision, scanning across the
rooftops. They're all very intent on seeing what's

1180
01:52:55,984 --> 01:52:57,963
going through the city.

1181
01:52:57,963 --> 01:53:00,303
LIAM: And do I see any motherfuckers on the
streets?

1182
01:53:00,303 --> 01:53:01,523
MATT: Make a perception check.

1183
01:53:01,523 --> 01:53:08,700
LIAM: Yeah. Use the Colville die, the meteorite.
It's pretty good. It's 29.

1184
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:16,430
MATT: 29? Okay. Couple things. One, as you glance
through the streets, you can see now why the top

1185
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:23,965
chamber of Thomara was so bereft of undead.
They've all been moved topside. You see, glancing

1186
01:53:23,965 --> 01:53:30,119
through the bits of street that you have in visual
range, maybe 35 to 40 dwarven undead that are

1187
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:36,647
wandering through open spaces, mixing with the
various soldiers from battles long past, when Thar

1188
01:53:36,647 --> 01:53:41,265
Amphala still existed in the Shadowfell. You've
encountered those undead already.

1189
01:53:41,265 --> 01:53:48,174
You also glance around past the gloomstalkers as
you're keeping an eye. As you're scanning through

1190
01:53:48,174 --> 01:53:53,663
the crowds, you see something different: larger,
flying through the skies on the opposite end of

1191
01:53:53,663 --> 01:54:01,014
the dome. It appears winged, with a tail, but
porous, like a tattered sail or a ladder. A

1192
01:54:01,014 --> 01:54:05,222
skeletal beast of long neck and tail makes a
baneful circle over the city with burning

1193
01:54:05,222 --> 01:54:07,047
green-blue eyes.

1194
01:54:07,047 --> 01:54:08,870
LIAM: Is it dragon-shaped?

1195
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:10,488
MATT: It's kind of dragon-shaped.

1196
01:54:10,488 --> 01:54:12,780
MARISHA: It's Daenerys' dragon!

1197
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:20,530
MATT: It appears to be skeletal. There is no
flesh. With what little bit of look you can see,

1198
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:23,012
you can see the light behind the dome is--

1199
01:54:23,012 --> 01:54:25,538
LAURA: How is it even flying?

1200
01:54:25,538 --> 01:54:30,522
LIAM: Is there any color to it, other than dead?

1201
01:54:30,522 --> 01:54:39,059
MATT: Not bleached-white bone, but yellowish,
off-white bone with various shades of rot to it.

1202
01:54:39,059 --> 01:54:45,519
It's coasting around and you get one view of it as
it begins to spin. You get a faint, distant glance

1203
01:54:45,519 --> 01:54:51,627
at it. You only see one, but it is apparently also
making its path over the city with the rest of the

1204
01:54:51,627 --> 01:55:00,766
gloomstalkers. It does have stretched bits of
broken, leftover flesh and leather that are

1205
01:55:00,766 --> 01:55:02,200
tattered in places.

1206
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:07,258
LIAM: Do me a favor and stay down there. It's a
real party up here, and everybody's dead.

1207
01:55:07,258 --> 01:55:08,846
TRAVIS: I like parties.

1208
01:55:08,846 --> 01:55:17,970
LIAM: There is a dead dragon in the sky, and
there's a lot of dead dwarves and other various

1209
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:26,882
types, and those things that Scanlan charmed a few
days ago. It is really shitty up here, so stay put.

1210
01:55:26,882 --> 01:55:29,825
LAURA: Do any of them seem to have noticed this
tunnel?

1211
01:55:29,825 --> 01:55:31,470
LIAM: I don't believe so.

1212
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:33,578
LAURA: Then come back down here.

1213
01:55:33,578 --> 01:55:37,213
LIAM: I back slowly the 15 feet that I traveled.

1214
01:55:37,213 --> 01:55:40,297
LAURA: So what's the plan here, guys?

1215
01:55:40,297 --> 01:55:50,352
TRAVIS: I don't know how much further we have, but
we really need that sword, right? We still have

1216
01:55:50,352 --> 01:55:51,886
not seen the Sword of Kas?

1217
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:53,209
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about that.

1218
01:55:53,209 --> 01:55:54,730
TRAVIS: Oh. Good.

1219
01:55:54,730 --> 01:56:04,184
TALIESIN: I haven't come up with anything. No, we
could try and find the object. There are legends

1220
01:56:04,184 --> 01:56:11,517
that say that the sword was lost somewhere near
the city. We are, for as much of a moving, still

1221
01:56:11,517 --> 01:56:15,189
in the earth somewhere near the city. We could
find the sword.

1222
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:16,996
LAURA: Potentially.

1223
01:56:16,996 --> 01:56:20,021
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe it's in the dirt that we just
came by!

1224
01:56:20,021 --> 01:56:25,257
TALIESIN: I really hope we don't have to go back
down there, but maybe. That might have been what

1225
01:56:25,257 --> 01:56:26,959
they were searching for.

1226
01:56:26,959 --> 01:56:30,711
LIAM: You can scry on people. Can you scry on
things?

1227
01:56:30,711 --> 01:56:35,034
MARISHA: I can. I don't currently have Locate
Object with me.

1228
01:56:35,034 --> 01:56:37,392
LAURA: I have Locate Object.

1229
01:56:37,392 --> 01:56:39,852
MARISHA: I can give my Scrying Eye to Vex.

1230
01:56:39,852 --> 01:56:42,248
LAURA: So that we can see it, so we can locate
it.

1231
01:56:42,248 --> 01:56:44,160
TRAVIS: Oh, because we haven't seen it yet?

1232
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:49,499
MARISHA: I don't know what it looks like. Unless
we have seen it, in which case I still don't know

1233
01:56:49,499 --> 01:56:50,920
what it looks like.

1234
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,525
TRAVIS: I think the Death Knight was holding the
Sword of Kas.

1235
01:56:54,525 --> 01:56:56,690
LAURA: Well, we'll find out when we scry on it,
won't we?

1236
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:59,819
MARISHA: I pull out the Scrying Eye, toss it to
Vex.

1237
01:56:59,819 --> 01:57:03,021
MATT: Have you scryed before?

1238
01:57:03,021 --> 01:57:04,641
LAURA: I haven't.

1239
01:57:04,641 --> 01:57:08,781
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you about to ride the Matrix,
girl! You about to plug in!

1240
01:57:08,781 --> 01:57:12,939
SAM: Your first time's always disappointing.

1241
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:21,753
MARISHA: You can have these rushes, you know? It
can get a little intense. You'll be great. Yeah.

1242
01:57:21,753 --> 01:57:23,817
Try and focus real hard, though.

1243
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:27,081
LAURA: I focus on the Sword of Kas.

1244
01:57:27,081 --> 01:57:31,926
MARISHA: Yes, and try and keep your mind clear and
on the sword, or else you'll get other weird

1245
01:57:31,926 --> 01:57:33,424
interference.

1246
01:57:33,424 --> 01:57:43,524
LAURA: I'm thinking of so many other things, but
I'm really trying to focus on this sword, okay?

1247
01:57:43,524 --> 01:57:47,459
Penises, dicks. No, Sword of Kas! Sword!

1248
01:57:47,459 --> 01:57:49,570
MARISHA: It's very phallic, but <i>sword.</i>

1249
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:56,725
MATT: All right, so. As you glance into this
crystalline sphere, your vision begins to go dark

1250
01:57:56,725 --> 01:58:01,814
at the edges. Tunnel vision begins to slowly swell
and take your view. Your breath quickens. It's a

1251
01:58:01,814 --> 01:58:08,307
really uncomfortable and unfamiliar feeling. But
as your vision goes tunnel into the sphere, the

1252
01:58:08,307 --> 01:58:14,380
coloration and the diffraction of the little bit
of light and vision you have in this tunnel go

1253
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:22,077
cloudy and blur. The tunnel vision withdraws. It
gets darker and darker, and you can see before you

1254
01:58:22,077 --> 01:58:35,896
a hilt of some sort of black blade. It's beautiful
and hooked in places. It's surrounded by muck.

1255
01:58:35,896 --> 01:58:43,556
It's surrounded by what you get a sense of, but
there's no open space around it. It is in some

1256
01:58:43,556 --> 01:58:45,932
thick, molasses-like silt.

1257
01:58:45,932 --> 01:58:51,724
LAURA: It's buried. Does it seem like the dirt
that surrounds the Shadowfell? Is it that kind of dirt?

1258
01:58:51,901 --> 01:58:57,129
MATT: It's the same color. There's no light in the
vicinity. You can sense it's there, but you do

1259
01:58:57,129 --> 01:59:06,031
sense that the earth around it is not super hard.
There is a dampness. When I say silt--

1260
01:59:06,031 --> 01:59:10,257
LAURA: Oh no, now I'm thinking of dicks again! Hold
on. Sword!

1261
01:59:10,257 --> 01:59:12,255
MARISHA: Focus, Vex! Focus.

1262
01:59:12,255 --> 01:59:14,151
TRAVIS: Big black sword.

1263
01:59:14,151 --> 01:59:25,660
(laughter)

1264
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:28,339
TALIESIN: We're going to die.

1265
01:59:28,339 --> 01:59:32,554
MATT: It seems to be submerged somewhere.

1266
01:59:32,554 --> 01:59:41,437
(laughter)

1267
01:59:41,437 --> 01:59:44,039
SAM: Children.

1268
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:45,804
LAURA: I'm focusing!

1269
01:59:45,804 --> 01:59:55,042
MATT: So you see it before you, but because it's
seemingly buried in this area of damp rock and

1270
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:59,262
silt, you have no other idea of where it is.

1271
01:59:59,262 --> 02:00:01,058
LAURA: Okay, but I did get a good look at it, at
least?

1272
02:00:01,058 --> 02:00:03,235
MATT: As much as the Scry spell can employ, yes.

1273
02:00:03,235 --> 02:00:14,531
LAURA: Okay. All right, thanks, stone! It was not
being held by that knight. No. It was buried

1274
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:15,936
somewhere.

1275
02:00:15,936 --> 02:00:20,384
MARISHA: I told you it was where we just walked
by! I don't know if that's true.

1276
02:00:20,384 --> 02:00:25,737
LAURA: I'm going to give Vax a super detailed
description. I don't know if it helps, but I know

1277
02:00:25,737 --> 02:00:27,411
we can both cast Locate Object.

1278
02:00:27,411 --> 02:00:28,746
LIAM: Yeah, but you saw it.

1279
02:00:28,746 --> 02:00:30,454
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm giving you a really detailed
description!

1280
02:00:30,454 --> 02:00:31,651
LIAM: But I didn't see it.

1281
02:00:31,651 --> 02:00:33,650
LAURA: We're twins! Look into my mind!

1282
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:37,557
LIAM: You have the spell, yeah? So you should do
it.

1283
02:00:37,557 --> 02:00:40,968
MARISHA: Can I have my Scrying Eye back?

1284
02:00:40,968 --> 02:00:46,311
LAURA: Have you scryed on any of us, without us
knowing?

1285
02:00:46,311 --> 02:00:50,888
TRAVIS: You can admit it. It's okay. Come clean.

1286
02:00:50,888 --> 02:00:53,289
TALIESIN: She's a terrible liar. We'd know.

1287
02:00:53,289 --> 02:00:56,630
MARISHA: I wanted to scry on Scanlan, but then
Grog wouldn't let me.

1288
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:59,341
SAM: Why would you want to scry on me?

1289
02:00:59,341 --> 02:01:02,511
LAURA: Oh, when you were missing and we didn't
know if you were safe or not.

1290
02:01:02,511 --> 02:01:07,920
SAM: If you did, you would've seen this: a big
black sword.

1291
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:14,434
TRAVIS: Is that what you call big?

1292
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:19,464
SAM: I'm a little guy. Look, it's bigger than my
mug!

1293
02:01:19,464 --> 02:01:24,513
MARISHA: Did you really paint Mythcarver black?
Why would you do that?

1294
02:01:24,513 --> 02:01:28,434
SAM: For a joke.

1295
02:01:28,434 --> 02:01:36,534
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Locate Object and
envision the Sword of Kas to see if it's around

1296
02:01:36,534 --> 02:01:43,239
us. I cast it at 3rd level, though, because I used
up all my 2nd.

1297
02:01:43,239 --> 02:01:51,228
MATT: Okay. Within a thousand feet of you. Okay.

1298
02:01:51,228 --> 02:01:54,917
SAM: Is it a roll? No, it's a thing that happens.

1299
02:01:54,917 --> 02:01:59,096
MATT: In a brief instant, you close your eyes,
recite the incantation, snap your fingers. As you

1300
02:01:59,096 --> 02:02:06,384
do, from behind your closed lids, you immediately
feel this draw, this sense, this direction. It is

1301
02:02:06,384 --> 02:02:12,979
not moving. It is stationary. It is--

1302
02:02:12,979 --> 02:02:14,618
MARISHA: 3,000 miles away.

1303
02:02:14,618 --> 02:02:25,849
MATT: No, it's within a thousand miles. Let me
see. Sense the direction. So you know the

1304
02:02:25,849 --> 02:02:32,706
direction of it at all times. You don't know quite
how far from you it is. You sense it's lateral and

1305
02:02:32,706 --> 02:02:38,577
down from where you are. Deeper toward the city,
but at a downward angle.

1306
02:02:38,577 --> 02:02:43,270
LAURA: So underground. So we don't have to go
above ground to find it. Do you guys want to spend

1307
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:44,779
time getting this sword?

1308
02:02:44,779 --> 02:02:47,139
TALIESIN: It would be advantageous.

1309
02:02:47,139 --> 02:02:49,095
TRAVIS: Do we really need it?

1310
02:02:49,095 --> 02:02:51,942
LAURA: It's super important to fighting Vecna.

1311
02:02:51,942 --> 02:02:56,952
TRAVIS: We had the ability to tunnel through
earth, but this guy let it go.

1312
02:02:56,952 --> 02:03:01,345
SAM: Who are you people? Let me go! I'm innocent!

1313
02:03:01,345 --> 02:03:03,335
MARISHA: Your wife left you!

1314
02:03:03,335 --> 02:03:08,704
SAM: Oh, that's true! (fake sobbing) That is my
backstory!

1315
02:03:08,704 --> 02:03:11,815
LAURA: What about the earth elemental thing that
you were going to do? Can you still do that and

1316
02:03:11,815 --> 02:03:13,316
tunnel with that?

1317
02:03:13,316 --> 02:03:17,984
MARISHA: That lets me glide through earth. It
doesn't let me tunnel. I can do a Move Earth

1318
02:03:17,984 --> 02:03:19,356
spell.

1319
02:03:19,356 --> 02:03:25,285
LAURA: You can't take me with you if you glide
through the earth, can you?

1320
02:03:25,285 --> 02:03:31,510
MARISHA: You would die. You would suffocate and be
crushed from the pressure of the earth.

1321
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:37,762
TRAVIS: Unless you wanted to hop in the necklace
and give it to her in the elemental form.

1322
02:03:37,762 --> 02:03:40,686
SAM: But you wouldn't be able to help her find it
in a necklace.

1323
02:03:40,686 --> 02:03:45,269
LAURA: It's that direction.

1324
02:03:45,269 --> 02:03:50,342
SAM: Is it the direction that we came from, or the
direction that we are going, but down?

1325
02:03:50,342 --> 02:03:51,885
MATT: The direction you're going, but down.

1326
02:03:51,885 --> 02:03:54,067
TALIESIN: Like hopping Earth orbit.

1327
02:03:54,067 --> 02:03:57,659
SAM: We don't know if there's even any catacombs
or anything down there. It could be buried in

1328
02:03:57,659 --> 02:03:59,069
solid earth.

1329
02:03:59,069 --> 02:04:00,700
LAURA: Which is why Keyleth is clutch.

1330
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:02,975
SAM: And it could be a thousand feet down.

1331
02:04:02,975 --> 02:04:05,107
TRAVIS: That's probably what they were looking
for.

1332
02:04:05,107 --> 02:04:06,710
TALIESIN: It's probably what they were digging
for.

1333
02:04:06,710 --> 02:04:11,575
TRAVIS: But they were going the wrong way.

1334
02:04:11,575 --> 02:04:16,266
TALIESIN: I can keep blowing his mind like this.
It's quite nice.

1335
02:04:16,266 --> 02:04:21,168
MARISHA: Okay, all right, shit. Do you know how
close it is?

1336
02:04:21,168 --> 02:04:27,368
LAURA: It's within a thousand feet. Right? Yeah,
no, I only sense things within a thousand feet.

1337
02:04:27,368 --> 02:04:36,427
TALIESIN: How much of a problem is the Move Earth,
and how far can we go? A thousand feet, with the

1338
02:04:36,427 --> 02:04:37,496
Move Earth?

1339
02:04:37,496 --> 02:04:39,596
LAURA: What if I point Keyleth in the direction?
Can you glide as an earth elemental and find it

1340
02:04:39,596 --> 02:04:40,975
that way?

1341
02:04:40,975 --> 02:04:44,108
MATT: Do consider, once you do find it, the sword
cannot earthglide with you.

1342
02:04:44,108 --> 02:04:45,969
LAURA: Oh, it can't?

1343
02:04:45,969 --> 02:04:49,142
SAM: If only we had some sort of sphere!

1344
02:04:49,142 --> 02:04:56,501
LAURA: If only somebody hadn't sent it away! Which
is, by the way, chasing behind us still.

1345
02:04:56,501 --> 02:04:58,567
MATT: Yeah, probably.

1346
02:04:58,567 --> 02:05:01,637
SAM: Shit. But when it catches up to us, we'll
take it back!

1347
02:05:01,637 --> 02:05:08,632
LAURA: Maybe see if you can sense it right now.
See if you can take it back right now.

1348
02:05:08,632 --> 02:05:15,151
SAM: Simon? Answer your master. I can't.

1349
02:05:15,151 --> 02:05:18,186
LAURA: Keep trying.

1350
02:05:18,186 --> 02:05:26,461
MATT: The spell only lasts for up to ten minutes,
by the way.

1351
02:05:26,461 --> 02:05:28,778
TALIESIN: We have to move quick.

1352
02:05:28,778 --> 02:05:30,299
MATT: So you've got to move quick.

1353
02:05:30,299 --> 02:05:32,389
LAURA: I'm going to have to keep casting it.

1354
02:05:32,389 --> 02:05:37,040
MARISHA: All right, here's the thing. I have an
8th-level spell left, and I have a 9th-level spell

1355
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:47,000
left. I want to save one of those. I can Move
Earth and make 40-foot tunnels for up to two hours

1356
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,004
as I go.

1357
02:05:50,004 --> 02:05:55,151
LIAM: Do we have the Gate Stones? Both of them?

1358
02:05:55,151 --> 02:06:03,039
SAM: Yeah. Gate Stones? They're not Gate Stones.

1359
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:04,389
LAURA: Whatever, but yeah.

1360
02:06:04,389 --> 02:06:05,703
LIAM: Do we have them?

1361
02:06:05,703 --> 02:06:07,114
SAM: I have one.

1362
02:06:07,114 --> 02:06:14,538
LIAM: I have a great idea, but it'd take a little
time. I have a little tub of oil that makes you

1363
02:06:14,538 --> 02:06:22,532
ethereal, and if one of us-- you, me, whoever--
travels through the ethereal plane and walks down

1364
02:06:22,532 --> 02:06:27,210
to the sword and waits with it and then pops back
into the material plane--

1365
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:28,685
SAM: Underground?

1366
02:06:28,685 --> 02:06:31,185
LIAM: Finds it and then waits somewhere.

1367
02:06:31,185 --> 02:06:39,336
LAURA: I've got another idea. But your idea led to
this idea. It's a building process. What if

1368
02:06:39,336 --> 02:06:44,510
Keyleth took one of the Gate Stones, glided down
there as an earth elemental, grabbed the sword,

1369
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:46,318
and then bamfed back to us.

1370
02:06:46,318 --> 02:06:49,976
MARISHA: Would that work?

1371
02:06:49,976 --> 02:06:52,758
SAM: She'd have to become a different form.

1372
02:06:52,758 --> 02:06:54,313
LAURA: An earth elemental.

1373
02:06:54,313 --> 02:06:57,689
TRAVIS: In your ethereal idea, do you leave your
physical body and your stuff?

1374
02:06:57,689 --> 02:07:01,239
LIAM: No, I'm on a different plane parallel to
this one.

1375
02:07:01,239 --> 02:07:04,942
SAM: She'd become an earth elemental in solid
earth.

1376
02:07:04,942 --> 02:07:09,418
TALIESIN: It takes a minute to activate the stone,
though. You would be down there-- that's the

1377
02:07:09,418 --> 02:07:10,502
problem.

1378
02:07:10,502 --> 02:07:12,192
LAURA: That's why Keyleth could do it.

1379
02:07:12,192 --> 02:07:19,456
MARISHA: Yeah, but the voice from above said I
can't glide the sword with me, but I should be

1380
02:07:19,456 --> 02:07:23,406
able to grab it and then concentrate--

1381
02:07:23,406 --> 02:07:25,797
SAM: And change your form into an earth
elemental.

1382
02:07:25,797 --> 02:07:29,648
MARISHA: Well, I'll already be an earth elemental,
and I'll have the Gate Stone.

1383
02:07:29,648 --> 02:07:33,863
LIAM: Do you have any sense of if it's buried very
deep? Or is it sitting in a puddle of shit?

1384
02:07:33,863 --> 02:07:35,508
LAURA: I can send her in a direction.

1385
02:07:35,508 --> 02:07:37,800
LIAM: We don't know, though.

1386
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:47,209
MARISHA: All right, this is a good plan. What if
we combine plans? Because etherealness can let you

1387
02:07:47,209 --> 02:07:58,706
glide through your plane, right? It's a glidey
thing, but for all things. Right, so can you take

1388
02:07:58,706 --> 02:08:03,284
the potion, piggy-back on me, we glide together,
get the sword--

1389
02:08:03,284 --> 02:08:05,079
LIAM: She would not be able to hold onto it.

1390
02:08:05,079 --> 02:08:07,262
LAURA: But I would help her find it.

1391
02:08:07,262 --> 02:08:13,232
SAM: But you would be a mist. How would you tell
her anything?

1392
02:08:13,232 --> 02:08:14,721
TALIESIN: She would follow her.

1393
02:08:14,721 --> 02:08:16,509
SAM: How are you going to see?

1394
02:08:16,509 --> 02:08:19,089
MARISHA: We've got our awesome telekinetic
earrings.

1395
02:08:19,089 --> 02:08:21,977
MATT: You still have to whisper in the earring.

1396
02:08:21,977 --> 02:08:27,994
LIAM: They're two different dimensions. It's two
different planes. But if you or I, with Locate

1397
02:08:27,994 --> 02:08:34,221
Object, douse ourselves in this oil and we locate
the object, we know exactly where it is, and we

1398
02:08:34,221 --> 02:08:40,522
move toward it and then go down there. It might be
encased in a ton of stone or something. We don't

1399
02:08:40,522 --> 02:08:48,158
know. We could go toward it, find it, and then go
sit 20 or 30 feet away from it, wait to pop back

1400
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:52,048
into this plane, go grab it, Gate Stone up here.

1401
02:08:52,048 --> 02:08:56,336
TRAVIS: That's not a terrible idea, if your stuff
works that way.

1402
02:08:56,336 --> 02:08:59,529
SAM: And if you can find a place to pop back into
existence 30 feet away.

1403
02:08:59,529 --> 02:09:08,237
MARISHA: And I can make tunnels, though, as long
as I go with you. I can't find it alone. I can get

1404
02:09:08,237 --> 02:09:09,655
close.

1405
02:09:09,655 --> 02:09:15,941
TRAVIS: It's also super loud and moves a lot of
stuff, and shit collapses--

1406
02:09:15,941 --> 02:09:23,173
LIAM: Also, I should try to do it, because if I
come back in a wall of stone, it doesn't matter.

1407
02:09:23,173 --> 02:09:28,583
TRAVIS: All in favor of the ethereal idea, raise
your hands.

1408
02:09:28,583 --> 02:09:30,040
LAURA: How long does it last?

1409
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,215
LIAM: An hour.

1410
02:09:31,215 --> 02:09:34,259
TRAVIS: All in favor of the earthglide elemental,
raise your hand.

1411
02:09:34,259 --> 02:09:36,475
MARISHA: Wait, I thought we had to have more or
less both, though.

1412
02:09:36,475 --> 02:09:37,817
LAURA: We have to have both.

1413
02:09:37,817 --> 02:09:43,297
LIAM: Why? We have the Gate Stone. Ethereal will
take me down toward the thing. I wait by it, pop

1414
02:09:43,297 --> 02:09:45,984
back into material, pick it up, Gate Stone back--

1415
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:47,559
TRAVIS: Is Gate Stone immediate?

1416
02:09:47,559 --> 02:09:49,021
LIAM: It takes a minute to do.

1417
02:09:49,021 --> 02:09:53,539
MARISHA: That's not how earth works, though. You
can't wait down there and then switch back and

1418
02:09:53,539 --> 02:09:55,487
then think you can grab this.

1419
02:09:55,487 --> 02:09:59,496
LIAM: We don't know that we're going through solid
earth. It could be sitting in a foot-deep puddle

1420
02:09:59,496 --> 02:10:05,313
of muck in a cavern somewhere. It's not like it
was teleported into a solid mountain.

1421
02:10:05,313 --> 02:10:12,556
MARISHA: If it was sitting under a foot deep of
muck, someone would have found it by now.

1422
02:10:12,556 --> 02:10:18,860
LIAM: We've been stealthing for not too much
space. I think that I could get pretty far.

1423
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:20,607
SAM: But <i>she</i> knows where it is.

1424
02:10:20,607 --> 02:10:23,214
LIAM: Well, I could do the same thing that she
did.

1425
02:10:23,214 --> 02:10:24,709
SAM: All right, do it.

1426
02:10:24,709 --> 02:10:26,335
MARISHA: But she knows what it looks like.

1427
02:10:26,335 --> 02:10:29,518
LIAM: If you hand me that bauble again, I can do
the same thing.

1428
02:10:29,518 --> 02:10:31,289
MATT: Unfortunately, it's already been used.

1429
02:10:31,289 --> 02:10:34,844
TRAVIS: You've got to let Vex go.

1430
02:10:34,844 --> 02:10:39,516
LIAM: That is hilarious.

1431
02:10:39,516 --> 02:10:43,839
MARISHA: It's got to be a Vex and Kiki. That's the
thing: it's got to be both of us.

1432
02:10:43,839 --> 02:10:45,433
TALIESIN: Can you follow her?

1433
02:10:45,433 --> 02:10:50,585
SAM: No, she cannot. She won't be able to see her.
If you're ethereal, you're in a different plane.

1434
02:10:50,585 --> 02:11:04,194
MARISHA: You're stealthy as fuck. We can get
there, get close enough, get above it, and then--

1435
02:11:04,194 --> 02:11:07,708
TRAVIS: You're talking about going in the open
air? Risking the open air to get closer?

1436
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:11,166
MARISHA: She's stealthy as fuck, and I can glide
under the dirt.

1437
02:11:11,166 --> 02:11:14,269
TRAVIS: Leaves a lot of room for a bad roll.

1438
02:11:14,269 --> 02:11:16,160
TALIESIN: Or we make a tunnel and we all go.

1439
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,629
SAM: Why don't you go find it and come back and
tell us?

1440
02:11:18,629 --> 02:11:24,441
LIAM: Let's try your idea. You thought that I
would be able to locate it by you telling me about

1441
02:11:24,441 --> 02:11:26,160
it, so what did it look like?

1442
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,262
LAURA: I explain exactly what it looked like.

1443
02:11:28,262 --> 02:11:30,824
LIAM: Awesome. I'm going to cast Locate Object
right now.

1444
02:11:30,824 --> 02:11:39,926
MATT: Okay. As you cast the spell, you close your
eyes and snap your fingers. It can't find

1445
02:11:39,926 --> 02:11:44,221
anything. Unfortunately, you have to have seen the
object for the spell to have an effect.

1446
02:11:44,221 --> 02:11:57,536
LIAM: No, I'm not upset at you. I'm upset at
Laura, because this was my idea on the break, and

1447
02:11:57,536 --> 02:12:06,772
it got yanked from me, but what are you going to
do? I'm not upset. It's fine. I'm taking my

1448
02:12:06,772 --> 02:12:08,938
marbles and going home!

1449
02:12:08,938 --> 02:12:14,060
TRAVIS: So how long can you tunnel? And how long
in each tunneling thing?

1450
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:17,522
LAURA: Plus, If I give you a direction, you can
tunnel in that direction, you can earthglide in

1451
02:12:17,522 --> 02:12:23,174
that direction until you find the sword, grab a
hold of it and try to bamf back. Let's try that.

1452
02:12:23,174 --> 02:12:24,776
TRAVIS: Or tunnel back.

1453
02:12:24,776 --> 02:12:26,555
MARISHA: With you telling me where it is?

1454
02:12:26,555 --> 02:12:28,204
LAURA: I'll point you in a direction.

1455
02:12:28,204 --> 02:12:29,604
LIAM: What's the range on the earring?

1456
02:12:29,604 --> 02:12:32,289
MARISHA: Yeah, can she guide me through--

1457
02:12:32,289 --> 02:12:39,256
LIAM: Wait, the ring. Within 60 feet of each
other. All of this was a waste of time.

1458
02:12:39,256 --> 02:12:42,108
TALIESIN: Tunnel!

1459
02:12:42,108 --> 02:12:46,622
MARISHA: All right, I tunnel, then! Fucking hell!

1460
02:12:46,622 --> 02:12:57,015
MATT: This was so much DND right there. All the
DND. Everyone who's ever played DND is right now

1461
02:12:57,015 --> 02:13:01,579
going "yep, I've been there." All right, so what's
the plan?

1462
02:13:01,579 --> 02:13:05,081
LAURA: We tunnel towards the fucking sword.

1463
02:13:05,081 --> 02:13:09,446
TALIESIN: We collapse the tunnels behind us.

1464
02:13:09,446 --> 02:13:11,602
TRAVIS: Pike and I charge out of the tunnel.

1465
02:13:11,602 --> 02:13:17,392
TALIESIN: You lead us, we go straight there. Less
than a thousand feet.

1466
02:13:17,392 --> 02:13:19,377
SAM: Okay, let's go.

1467
02:13:19,377 --> 02:13:21,944
TALIESIN: I know that this is burning, but we've
got no choice.

1468
02:13:21,944 --> 02:13:25,777
LAURA: We know the direction. Go in that
direction.

1469
02:13:25,777 --> 02:13:28,808
MARISHA: Are we going to try and go above, or are
we tunnelling all the way there?

1470
02:13:28,808 --> 02:13:32,639
LAURA: In the direction that I'm pointing. Tunnel
that way.

1471
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:38,634
MARISHA: I'm going to burn my 8th-level spell on
Move Earth. I still have a 9th, and then this is

1472
02:13:38,634 --> 02:13:40,359
reaching the end of my shit.

1473
02:13:40,359 --> 02:13:47,135
MATT: All right, so this lasts up to two hours,
concentration, and you can move a 40-foot space to

1474
02:13:47,135 --> 02:13:48,974
create a tunnel every ten minutes.

1475
02:13:48,974 --> 02:13:51,635
SAM: Every ten minutes? That's useless.

1476
02:13:51,635 --> 02:13:53,643
TALIESIN: Under a thousand feet.

1477
02:13:53,643 --> 02:13:57,312
SAM: The Locate Object only lasts ten minutes.

1478
02:13:57,312 --> 02:13:59,466
LIAM: It's within a thousand feet.

1479
02:13:59,466 --> 02:14:04,594
LAURA: And then I can cast it again twice. I have
two more times to cast it.

1480
02:14:04,594 --> 02:14:06,219
LIAM: A thousand feet is not that far.

1481
02:14:06,219 --> 02:14:08,085
TRAVIS: Did you say 40 feet?

1482
02:14:08,085 --> 02:14:10,978
SAM and MARISHA: Every ten minutes.

1483
02:14:10,978 --> 02:14:15,645
TRAVIS: And we've got three of those, so we're
going 120 feet?

1484
02:14:15,645 --> 02:14:21,636
LAURA: No, she can keep going that direction and
then I'll cast it again in a little bit.

1485
02:14:21,636 --> 02:14:23,430
TALIESIN: That's assuming we hit no pockets.

1486
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:29,230
SAM: 240 feet. That gets us 480 total feet
possible in two hours. Halfway.

1487
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:33,382
LIAM: It's more likely that this thing is sitting
in a pool of stilted water. It's probably not

1488
02:14:33,382 --> 02:14:38,510
encased in a passageway of stone, because how did
it get there?

1489
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:43,333
MARISHA: If that's the case, we have to move on
foot above ground quickly and get close, and then

1490
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:51,102
I can tunnel us down. I think that's the only way.
Other than that, we're taking several hours to get

1491
02:14:51,102 --> 02:14:54,727
there at a very slow pace.

1492
02:14:54,727 --> 02:14:56,690
SAM: And we might not get there.

1493
02:14:56,690 --> 02:15:04,037
TRAVIS: Two dozen plus things flying around. Pike
and I are going to roll some stealth checks. It'll

1494
02:15:04,037 --> 02:15:05,342
be great.

1495
02:15:05,342 --> 02:15:07,103
TALIESIN: All right, fuck.

1496
02:15:07,103 --> 02:15:09,748
MARISHA: Wait!

1497
02:15:09,748 --> 02:15:13,438
ALL: Wait.

1498
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:18,470
TALIESIN: (laughs) Does anybody know that joke
outside of this room? Wait, that's right. We

1499
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:20,170
Instagrammed it.

1500
02:15:20,170 --> 02:15:22,494
MARISHA: Scanlan, you still have a mansion?

1501
02:15:22,494 --> 02:15:23,777
SAM: I do.

1502
02:15:23,777 --> 02:15:31,794
MARISHA: We could break this up. Scanlan casts the
mansion, we split the party, and we have a stealth

1503
02:15:31,794 --> 02:15:33,888
team go get the sword and come back--

1504
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,964
LIAM: And Vecna knows where we are.

1505
02:15:35,964 --> 02:15:37,254
MARISHA: If they're in the mansion, though--

1506
02:15:37,254 --> 02:15:38,970
LAURA: You can't sense anybody in the mansion.

1507
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:43,371
MARISHA: He can't sense anyone in the mansion, so
we cast the mansion while you're still here. Half

1508
02:15:43,371 --> 02:15:48,590
the party goes in, team Stealth Sword Recovery
Plan goes out, gets the sword, while the rest of

1509
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:50,631
the team camps in the mansion.

1510
02:15:50,631 --> 02:15:53,905
TRAVIS: If there's anything around that sword when
you get there, you're on your own.

1511
02:15:53,905 --> 02:15:57,039
LAURA: Then we go away. We don't try to fight it.

1512
02:15:57,039 --> 02:16:01,667
MARISHA: Unless we all want to decide, right here
and right now, to try and get closer to the sword

1513
02:16:01,667 --> 02:16:06,223
than the thousand feet we are potentially away
from it right now, together as a team, and then

1514
02:16:06,223 --> 02:16:08,782
cast the mansion. Or not at all.

1515
02:16:08,782 --> 02:16:18,866
TRAVIS: (laughs) This is craziness. I think there
is an upside to Pike and I not having to roll

1516
02:16:18,866 --> 02:16:23,230
those stealth checks, even with Pass Without a
Trace, but if there's anything around that sword,

1517
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:26,894
it's going to be up to you to either fight it and
get the sword, or get the fuck out.

1518
02:16:26,894 --> 02:16:28,279
LAURA: Avoid it, yeah.

1519
02:16:28,279 --> 02:16:30,523
TRAVIS: You want to do that?

1520
02:16:30,523 --> 02:16:35,017
SAM: Stealth team is not me, right? It's you two.

1521
02:16:35,017 --> 02:16:39,322
MARISHA: It'd be us two and maybe Vax, as well.

1522
02:16:39,322 --> 02:16:41,297
TRAVIS: Corner three.

1523
02:16:41,297 --> 02:16:42,994
LIAM: I'm not that stealthy.

1524
02:16:42,994 --> 02:16:45,840
LAURA: Let's do it.

1525
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:48,228
MARISHA: Does anyone have a better plan? Is this
what we're going with?

1526
02:16:48,228 --> 02:16:51,263
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Do it.

1527
02:16:51,263 --> 02:16:54,122
MATT: Okay, then.

1528
02:16:54,122 --> 02:16:59,080
SAM: We're also committing that this is where the
mansion is going to live for the night? Is this a

1529
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,465
good spot for it?

1530
02:17:00,465 --> 02:17:02,154
LAURA: The sphere is coming out soon.

1531
02:17:02,154 --> 02:17:05,568
MATT: Keyleth, Vex, you feel a very faint
vibration in the ground.

1532
02:17:05,568 --> 02:17:09,469
MARISHA: Does the sphere fuck up the mansion?

1533
02:17:09,469 --> 02:17:12,060
TALIESIN: It's a Disintegration spell.

1534
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:14,809
LAURA: Probably. We need to get out.

1535
02:17:14,809 --> 02:17:21,073
SAM: No, the mansion can't be seen. They would
have to know that it's there.

1536
02:17:21,073 --> 02:17:23,708
TRAVIS: Even if it accidentally hits it, it's
toast.

1537
02:17:23,708 --> 02:17:26,043
SAM: Well, we can hide it behind a closet or
something.

1538
02:17:26,043 --> 02:17:27,961
TALIESIN: There's no closet. We're in a tiny
tunnel.

1539
02:17:27,961 --> 02:17:29,821
SAM: I always carry a closet with me.

1540
02:17:29,821 --> 02:17:31,089
TALIESIN: We know.

1541
02:17:31,089 --> 02:17:33,724
MATT: What are you doing, guys?

1542
02:17:33,724 --> 02:17:37,120
LAURA: Let's peek up. Is anything near us right
now?

1543
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:41,260
MARISHA: And whatever the closest building is
closest to the sword.

1544
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:44,659
MATT: All right, so you guys all emerge out into
the open light--

1545
02:17:44,659 --> 02:17:49,073
LAURA: No, we don't! We peek up first to see if
anything's near us.

1546
02:17:49,073 --> 02:17:50,903
MATT: Make a perception check.

1547
02:17:50,903 --> 02:17:53,942
MARISHA: Who, all of us?

1548
02:17:53,942 --> 02:17:55,903
MATT: No, just the ones who are looking.

1549
02:17:55,903 --> 02:17:58,511
LAURA: 27.

1550
02:17:58,511 --> 02:17:59,821
LIAM: 31.

1551
02:17:59,821 --> 02:18:10,019
MATT: Okay, the two of you glance off as you're
emerging. Your exiting point looks to be a hole in

1552
02:18:10,019 --> 02:18:16,286
the middle of a street that has been dug down.
From this point, you can see there's a nearby

1553
02:18:16,286 --> 02:18:20,567
building, maybe 20 feet from you, that is a
two-story building that is partially collapsed,

1554
02:18:20,567 --> 02:18:22,220
but still mostly intact.

1555
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:24,507
LAURA: Is there anything around?

1556
02:18:24,507 --> 02:18:31,726
MATT: Yeah, there's a gloomstalker at any given
point in time within a hundred feet of you.

1557
02:18:31,726 --> 02:18:36,167
They're all keeping a net of movement around.

1558
02:18:36,167 --> 02:18:43,023
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to Grog and Pike.

1559
02:18:43,023 --> 02:18:45,532
MATT: You hear rocks beginning to emerge--

1560
02:18:45,532 --> 02:18:53,952
TALIESIN: I grab Grog and Pike. We're going to run
together. I activate my Silence spell. You two are

1561
02:18:53,952 --> 02:18:55,353
in my Silence spell.

1562
02:18:55,353 --> 02:18:56,783
TRAVIS: I've got Pike in my hand.

1563
02:18:56,783 --> 02:18:59,648
MARISHA: And you still have Pass Without a Trace.

1564
02:18:59,648 --> 02:19:01,140
LAURA: Still Pass Without a Trace.

1565
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:04,401
MATT: No, because when you cast Locate Object,
that stopped.

1566
02:19:04,401 --> 02:19:07,142
LAURA: I recast it! It's okay. I recast it.

1567
02:19:07,142 --> 02:19:15,374
MATT: Okay, mark that off. So as you guys all
emerge topside, rushing this 20 feet distance, I

1568
02:19:15,374 --> 02:19:21,338
need you all to make stealth checks. Grog, you
make it with advantage; you're still visible--

1569
02:19:21,338 --> 02:19:26,763
MARISHA: That doesn't take up one of your Locate
Object spells, does it? Then let me cast it. I'm

1570
02:19:26,763 --> 02:19:28,824
casting Pass Without a Trace, not her.

1571
02:19:28,824 --> 02:19:32,768
MATT: Using what spell level?

1572
02:19:32,768 --> 02:19:39,895
MARISHA: 2nd.

1573
02:19:39,895 --> 02:19:43,357
MATT: Sorry, I misheard. I thought you only had a
9th-level spell slot left.

1574
02:19:43,357 --> 02:19:47,954
MARISHA: No, I'm talking about my big mack daddies
in order to still cast other things.

1575
02:19:47,954 --> 02:19:52,555
TRAVIS: I had to roll for both of us.

1576
02:19:52,555 --> 02:19:54,054
TALIESIN: But you have advantage.

1577
02:19:54,054 --> 02:19:55,393
ASHLEY: You had to roll for both of us?

1578
02:19:55,393 --> 02:19:57,433
TRAVIS: But I had advantage. I think we're okay.

1579
02:19:57,433 --> 02:20:01,988
MARISHA: For everyone paying attention, I have
three 1st-level spells left, no 2nd-level spells,

1580
02:20:01,988 --> 02:20:09,505
two 3rd, one 4th, and then an 8th and a 9th. And
that's it.

1581
02:20:09,505 --> 02:20:10,812
SAM: You have advantage on this?

1582
02:20:10,812 --> 02:20:15,272
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage? Well, I might have
advantage also. I'm in the Silence spell also. Not

1583
02:20:15,272 --> 02:20:17,285
that I need it, though.

1584
02:20:17,285 --> 02:20:25,568
TRAVIS: That advantage saved that whole thing from
going tits-up, because that first roll was

1585
02:20:25,568 --> 02:20:27,298
(explosion).

1586
02:20:27,298 --> 02:20:29,256
SAM: 25.

1587
02:20:29,256 --> 02:20:32,145
TALIESIN: Natural 19, so 29.

1588
02:20:32,145 --> 02:20:36,929
MARISHA: 18 plus nine plus another ten. 38.

1589
02:20:36,929 --> 02:20:39,522
LIAM: 37.

1590
02:20:39,522 --> 02:20:40,898
LAURA: 46.

1591
02:20:40,898 --> 02:20:42,541
TRAVIS: 24.

1592
02:20:42,541 --> 02:20:48,576
Wait, don't high-five shit yet! Why are
you high-fiving? What the fuck? What's wrong with

1593
02:20:48,576 --> 02:20:50,483
you people? Jesus!

1594
02:20:50,483 --> 02:20:52,247
SAM: What did Pike get?

1595
02:20:52,247 --> 02:21:01,517
MATT: Pike was being carried. His roll was
dependent on both of them. So as you guys dart

1596
02:21:01,517 --> 02:21:08,602
through the open light, the first time you've seen
light since arriving in this titan. The sky

1597
02:21:08,602 --> 02:21:13,778
outside is super dark; most of the light here is
actually emanating from the barrier. It's creating

1598
02:21:13,778 --> 02:21:22,443
its own false twilight sense over this entire
city. As you rush into the room, you all dart into

1599
02:21:22,443 --> 02:21:28,214
the nearby doorway. There's a half-ajar door
that's broken, and you push through, being careful

1600
02:21:28,214 --> 02:21:32,648
not to slam into it or to break it and cause any
noise, but you all rush into this chamber.

1601
02:21:32,648 --> 02:21:41,833
Immediately, the smell wafts of old decay, and
glancing around, you can see long-dried bits of

1602
02:21:41,833 --> 02:21:48,218
flesh or nondescript innards that have long
withered and turned to partial dust.

1603
02:21:48,218 --> 02:21:54,962
You all come into the shadow of the chamber and
take a minute to breathe. You hear the distant

1604
02:21:54,962 --> 02:22:06,781
sound (screeching, flapping, crunch). You hear one
perch on one of the buildings about one block down

1605
02:22:06,781 --> 02:22:19,326
(screeching, flapping) and continue off. It does
not appear that you are currently being stalked or

1606
02:22:19,326 --> 02:22:20,732
noticed.

1607
02:22:20,732 --> 02:22:24,333
TALIESIN: They can't hear you.

1608
02:22:24,333 --> 02:22:30,912
SAM: It is visible, so is there a closet in here
or some sort of alcove?

1609
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:35,215
MATT: If I recall correctly, the entrance is only
visible to people that you signify.

1610
02:22:35,215 --> 02:22:39,400
TALIESIN: People who see invisible things can see
it.

1611
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:45,280
SAM: The entrance shimmers faintly and is five
feet wide and ten feet tall. You and any creature

1612
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,276
you designate can enter.

1613
02:22:47,276 --> 02:22:51,096
MATT: Okay, it is visible, but only creatures you
designate can enter. That's the difference. So it

1614
02:22:51,096 --> 02:22:52,622
is a faint shimmer.

1615
02:22:52,622 --> 02:22:54,333
LAURA: We have to hide it, yeah.

1616
02:22:54,333 --> 02:22:56,065
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1617
02:22:56,065 --> 02:23:00,027
LAURA: Can I help him find a place that would be
hidden?

1618
02:23:00,027 --> 02:23:04,410
SAM: Investigation, I got a 23. 22.

1619
02:23:04,410 --> 02:23:10,535
MATT: Okay. You go to help him. Most of the
furniture in here is destroyed and withered. You

1620
02:23:10,535 --> 02:23:13,647
go upstairs, and there is a double-door cabinet. A
cupboard.

1621
02:23:13,647 --> 02:23:16,928
LIAM: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe!

1622
02:23:16,928 --> 02:23:19,510
MARISHA: I thought the same thing!

1623
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:25,536
SAM: Harry Potter lives there. I started reading
Harry Potter.

1624
02:23:25,536 --> 02:23:27,030
LAURA: Oh, I'm so glad!

1625
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,114
TRAVIS: Started?

1626
02:23:28,114 --> 02:23:30,009
SAM: Yeah, I'm on chapter three!

1627
02:23:30,009 --> 02:23:31,723
LIAM: Greetings, time traveler.

1628
02:23:31,723 --> 02:23:34,114
MATT: I can't wait to take you to Universal.

1629
02:23:34,114 --> 02:23:36,359
LAURA: It's going to be so great.

1630
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:41,640
MATT: All right, so you cast the mansion in the
cupboard. The shimmering purple hue, the familiar

1631
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:48,869
vision of the door of Scanlan's magnificent
mansion arrives. Who's going and who's staying?

1632
02:23:48,869 --> 02:23:54,730
Pike, Grog, Percy, and Scanlan staying? The three
of you going?

1633
02:23:54,730 --> 02:24:01,246
TRAVIS: I hold out my hand to Vax and I say: Good
luck. I hold out my hand to Vex and I say: Take

1634
02:24:01,246 --> 02:24:03,626
care of him.

1635
02:24:03,626 --> 02:24:11,709
TALIESIN: Just in case, is it wise to leave one of
the Gate Stones outside the door? You take one so

1636
02:24:11,709 --> 02:24:14,941
if you need to port back to it, it's here.

1637
02:24:14,941 --> 02:24:16,728
LAURA and LIAM: That's a good call.

1638
02:24:16,728 --> 02:24:18,561
MARISHA: Does someone have to be holding it?

1639
02:24:18,561 --> 02:24:20,991
TALIESIN: Nope!

1640
02:24:20,991 --> 02:24:22,567
LAURA: Put it in a cupboard.

1641
02:24:22,567 --> 02:24:24,369
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave it in the kitchen.

1642
02:24:24,369 --> 02:24:29,103
MATT: To transfer to a Gate Stone? No, you have to
activate it and hold it on one side, but it brings

1643
02:24:29,103 --> 02:24:30,825
you to wherever the Gate Stone is.

1644
02:24:30,825 --> 02:24:36,486
TALIESIN: So I'm going to put one of the Gate
Stones in a corner, so it's not so obvious. Yep.

1645
02:24:36,486 --> 02:24:39,641
And then you guys have the other one.

1646
02:24:39,641 --> 02:24:41,490
MARISHA: I have the other one, yeah.

1647
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:53,821
LIAM: You can get back on your own pretty easily,
yeah? Tunneling through stone, do you have that

1648
02:24:53,821 --> 02:24:55,443
left? Or that's done?

1649
02:24:55,443 --> 02:24:58,977
MARISHA: No, if I'm an earth elemental, I can
earthglide. I do still have that.

1650
02:24:58,977 --> 02:25:04,505
LIAM: I feel like maybe Vex should carry the
stone, then. She has less of a chance of getting

1651
02:25:04,505 --> 02:25:06,264
back on her own.

1652
02:25:06,264 --> 02:25:12,335
MARISHA: Yeah. Hopefully we're together, though,
but yeah. I toss Vex the Gate Stone.

1653
02:25:12,335 --> 02:25:18,217
MATT: Okay. You pocket it. You sense you maybe
have three more minutes on your spell, by the way, Vex.

1654
02:25:18,217 --> 02:25:20,391
LAURA: All right, it's that direction.

1655
02:25:20,391 --> 02:25:21,688
TALIESIN: All right, we're in the mansion.

1656
02:25:21,688 --> 02:25:24,423
MATT: Okay, the rest of you head into the mansion
quietly.

1657
02:25:24,423 --> 02:25:32,564
SAM: If we drink wine tonight, it will only be in
remembrance of you. Or to get snookered.

1658
02:25:32,564 --> 02:25:38,272
LAURA: If we don't come back, save Vasselheim on
your own and the entire world.

1659
02:25:38,272 --> 02:25:41,127
LIAM: (singing) Empty chairs at empty tables...

1660
02:25:41,127 --> 02:25:45,967
MARISHA: Team stealth is stealthing as far as we
can, yeah?

1661
02:25:45,967 --> 02:25:48,013
LIAM and LAURA: Yeah.

1662
02:25:48,013 --> 02:25:54,074
MARISHA: Oh my god. Team half-elf! Yeah! This is
me saying this, not Keyleth.

1663
02:25:54,074 --> 02:26:01,529
MATT: Okay, good to know. So as you all vanish in
the mansion, you are outside of the need to

1664
02:26:01,529 --> 02:26:10,510
utilize the radial portion of the ring. The three
of you with the spell quickly waning, you begin to

1665
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:13,416
make your way outdoors. I need another stealth
check from you three.

1666
02:26:13,416 --> 02:26:14,770
LAURA: Another one?

1667
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:16,592
ASHLEY: I love you guys. Please come back.

1668
02:26:16,592 --> 02:26:26,986
MARISHA: All right, don't fuck me, opal die. That
opal die fucked me. Wait, do I have advantage? No.

1669
02:26:26,986 --> 02:26:28,887
LAURA: You have plus ten.

1670
02:26:28,887 --> 02:26:32,885
TRAVIS: (laughing) Right out of the gate?!

1671
02:26:32,885 --> 02:26:35,026
MATT: What did you get?

1672
02:26:35,026 --> 02:26:41,186
LIAM: Does my luck transfer to anybody? No.

1673
02:26:41,186 --> 02:26:48,285
MARISHA: Can I do anything else? Okay, let's go!
And I run into a door.

1674
02:26:48,285 --> 02:26:53,160
MATT: So as you guys rush outward into the open
way, you begin to head across the thoroughfare,

1675
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:57,479
following Vex, who's currently leading the charge,
and you can sense it down below. At this point,

1676
02:26:57,479 --> 02:27:00,078
based on the trajectory of it, make an
intelligence check.

1677
02:27:00,078 --> 02:27:04,176
MARISHA: They covered for me, right?

1678
02:27:04,176 --> 02:27:07,420
LAURA: Intelligence?

1679
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,174
MATT: Yeah, roll plus your intelligence modifier.

1680
02:27:10,174 --> 02:27:12,722
LAURA: 12.

1681
02:27:12,722 --> 02:27:17,688
MATT: 12? Okay. You're not sure of the distance
based on the angle, but you know it's getting

1682
02:27:17,688 --> 02:27:22,427
closer. So you guys begin darting from building to
building. Keyleth is straggling a bit behind and

1683
02:27:22,427 --> 02:27:29,186
ends up stubbing her toe and instinctually lets
out a yelp sound. At which point, you hear a

1684
02:27:29,186 --> 02:27:30,554
distant shriek.

1685
02:27:30,554 --> 02:27:34,513
MARISHA: (shrieking noise)

1686
02:27:34,513 --> 02:27:37,194
TRAVIS: Wow, make it worse. That's a one.

1687
02:27:37,194 --> 02:27:38,993
LAURA: Go underground!

1688
02:27:38,993 --> 02:27:41,795
MARISHA: Earth elemental!

1689
02:27:41,795 --> 02:27:46,526
(laughter)

1690
02:27:46,526 --> 02:27:56,086
MATT: Okay. Thankfully, because there is an old
ancient cobblestone walkway here with loose stone,

1691
02:27:56,086 --> 02:27:59,565
but portions of it have been destroyed and broken,
and you can find loose earth easy enough and you

1692
02:27:59,565 --> 02:28:04,580
can dart in. You Scrooge McDuck dive into the
stone.

1693
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:18,131
As you guys dart off to the side and you watch as
two gloomstalkers land where she was (screeching)

1694
02:28:18,131 --> 02:28:25,311
and begin to scan over and look through, and
they're walking forward on their large, hefty,

1695
02:28:25,311 --> 02:28:30,759
muscular hind legs, walking past where you guys
are hiding off to the side. They stop and then

1696
02:28:30,759 --> 02:28:34,781
turn around, and one of them scans past and you
both barely duck out of the way.

1697
02:28:34,781 --> 02:28:41,184
They both take off, one after the other.

1698
02:28:41,184 --> 02:28:44,045
LIAM: Fuck a duck.

1699
02:28:44,045 --> 02:28:48,234
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

1700
02:28:48,234 --> 02:28:51,182
SAM: Does that burn your spell? Are you done?

1701
02:28:51,182 --> 02:28:55,444
MARISHA: No, I'm beast shaped. I'm my earth
elemental right now, okay? So I have tremorsense,

1702
02:28:55,444 --> 02:28:59,577
right? I sense the twins.

1703
02:28:59,577 --> 02:29:04,378
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object one more
time. Oh, that that takes me out of stealth,

1704
02:29:04,378 --> 02:29:05,606
doesn't it?

1705
02:29:05,606 --> 02:29:11,259
MARISHA: No. Oh. But I have Pass Without a Trace,
which is still going.

1706
02:29:11,259 --> 02:29:18,145
LIAM: Do you vaguely remember the direction it was
in? So maybe we go vague for a minute?

1707
02:29:18,145 --> 02:29:25,851
MARISHA: So I pop my head out, Jaws-ing.

1708
02:29:25,851 --> 02:29:30,879
LAURA: And I point in the direction and have her
keep following it.

1709
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:35,183
MARISHA: And I'm going to be like-- I'm going to
follow their footsteps with my tremorsense.

1710
02:29:35,183 --> 02:29:39,774
MATT: And as such, you don't have to make a
stealth check. You're down below, and you follow

1711
02:29:39,774 --> 02:29:45,860
their footsteps underneath. You guys continue on
your current stealth run. You get forward about

1712
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:50,242
another 150 or so feet. Do you want to keep going
or do you want to cast?

1713
02:29:50,242 --> 02:29:53,868
LAURA: Is there an abandoned-looking building or
anything I can duck into?

1714
02:29:53,868 --> 02:29:58,358
MATT: There's a handful. Most of the city has been
long abandoned.

1715
02:29:58,358 --> 02:30:01,304
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to duck under
something so I can cast the spell and then

1716
02:30:01,304 --> 02:30:03,954
re-stealth before I come back out so I don't bamf
in the middle.

1717
02:30:03,954 --> 02:30:08,309
MATT: Right. Okay, so you duck into a small
alleyway. You guys are keeping out of view and

1718
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:12,706
waiting for the swarms of undead in the street,
and as you come around the corner you immediately

1719
02:30:12,706 --> 02:30:20,791
see about 12 or 13 zombies clattering past. As
you're waiting for them to pass by, eventually

1720
02:30:20,791 --> 02:30:24,644
they get quieter and quieter. You take a minute
and you cast the spell Locate Object, and it's a

1721
02:30:24,644 --> 02:30:31,229
much steeper angle now. You're getting much closer
to it. So do you want to keep going?

1722
02:30:31,229 --> 02:30:35,239
LAURA: Yes. I want to re-stealth and move until
I'm directly over it.

1723
02:30:35,239 --> 02:30:39,819
MATT: Roll another stealth check. Both of you,
actually, because we've gone partway through. Not

1724
02:30:39,819 --> 02:30:42,629
that I have to worry about Vax.

1725
02:30:42,629 --> 02:30:46,985
LAURA: 33.

1726
02:30:46,985 --> 02:30:50,696
MATT: Yeah, because you still have Pass Without a
Trace from underneath.

1727
02:30:50,696 --> 02:30:52,788
LIAM: 40.

1728
02:30:52,788 --> 02:30:59,218
MATT: Okay. The two of you, making your way
through, ducking between streets and passages.

1729
02:30:59,218 --> 02:31:02,327
Eventually, you get to a point where you sense and
almost--

1730
02:31:02,327 --> 02:31:04,126
LAURA: Did she just yawn?

1731
02:31:04,126 --> 02:31:05,373
TRAVIS: No, she just <i>breathed</i>.

1732
02:31:05,373 --> 02:31:08,667
MARISHA: She stress exhaled.

1733
02:31:08,667 --> 02:31:13,503
ASHLEY: My hand, and it made a farting noise,
sorry.

1734
02:31:13,503 --> 02:31:19,630
MATT: You're fine. You get about another 85, 100
or so feet, and it's nearly directly below you.

1735
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:24,206
You're about halfway between the edge of the wall
and where Entropis, the tower, is.

1736
02:31:24,206 --> 02:31:32,192
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tap my foot on the
ground and point directly down to you, Keyleth.

1737
02:31:32,192 --> 02:31:40,258
MARISHA: Directly down. Doing this as I go.

1738
02:31:40,258 --> 02:31:42,339
MATT: Okay. So you swim down.

1739
02:31:42,339 --> 02:31:43,706
MARISHA: Yeah, swimming down.

1740
02:31:43,706 --> 02:31:48,614
MATT: Okay, and you're feeling through earth. Make
an investigation check.

1741
02:31:48,614 --> 02:31:51,004
MARISHA: Not my strongest suit.

1742
02:31:51,004 --> 02:31:56,122
MATT: With disadvantage because you are currently
blind in the earth.

1743
02:31:56,122 --> 02:31:58,702
MARISHA: No, I'm awesome.

1744
02:31:58,702 --> 02:32:03,071
MATT: You can glide through it. But you can't see
through the earth.

1745
02:32:03,071 --> 02:32:04,787
MARISHA: I'm an earth elemental.

1746
02:32:04,787 --> 02:32:06,681
MATT: Give it a shot.

1747
02:32:06,681 --> 02:32:08,613
TRAVIS: Come on, you got this. Let's go.

1748
02:32:08,613 --> 02:32:10,010
LIAM: Just roll high.

1749
02:32:10,010 --> 02:32:12,156
TRAVIS: Just drop it out your hand and watch as--

1750
02:32:12,156 --> 02:32:15,022
ALL: Yeah, okay.

1751
02:32:15,022 --> 02:32:19,485
MARISHA: Do I count the ones out? Can I roll it
again on the inside?

1752
02:32:19,485 --> 02:32:21,052
MATT: That's not how it works.

1753
02:32:21,052 --> 02:32:22,472
TRAVIS: Is it cocked? It looks cocked.

1754
02:32:22,472 --> 02:32:24,065
MATT: What did you roll?

1755
02:32:24,065 --> 02:32:30,300
MARISHA: Are we sure with disadvantage? Five.

1756
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:34,783
MATT: Five. Okay. You swim around for about a
minute or so, and you're finding nothing.

1757
02:32:34,783 --> 02:32:38,927
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm wise; I'm not smart. There's a
difference.

1758
02:32:38,927 --> 02:32:44,333
MATT: So yeah, you're swimming around in there.
You're not finding anything.

1759
02:32:44,333 --> 02:32:51,180
LAURA: Oh, does she still have the earring on? Any
luck?

1760
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:53,981
LIAM: She can't talk.

1761
02:32:53,981 --> 02:33:00,608
MARISHA: Actually, I can. We recently ruled.
because it's mental, yeah. Oh, wait. No.

1762
02:33:00,608 --> 02:33:02,493
LAURA: You don't know where it is?

1763
02:33:02,493 --> 02:33:03,839
MARISHA: No, I can't find it.

1764
02:33:03,839 --> 02:33:08,215
LAURA: Can I give her an idea of how deep down it
feels, how far away it is?

1765
02:33:08,215 --> 02:33:12,884
MATT: You don't know the distance, just direction.
You failed your intelligence check, so you're not

1766
02:33:12,884 --> 02:33:16,816
quite able to consider the changing angle for
distance.

1767
02:33:16,816 --> 02:33:28,924
MARISHA: But maybe that etherealness thing, and
now I can literally come up and drag you down.

1768
02:33:28,924 --> 02:33:32,733
LAURA: Would I be able to see the sword, though,
if I was on another plane?

1769
02:33:32,733 --> 02:33:34,304
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1770
02:33:34,304 --> 02:33:37,927
LIAM: I think so, yeah. You just can't interact.

1771
02:33:37,927 --> 02:33:43,969
LAURA: Do I get your thing of plus two because I'm
standing next to you?

1772
02:33:43,969 --> 02:33:45,218
LIAM: It's for saves, not checks.

1773
02:33:45,218 --> 02:33:46,642
LAURA: 13.

1774
02:33:46,642 --> 02:33:52,945
MATT: Okay. You don't know much about how
etherealness works or what the effects are. You

1775
02:33:52,945 --> 02:33:55,846
don't know if it will help or hinder. You're not
entirely certain what the effects will do.

1776
02:33:55,846 --> 02:33:57,067
LAURA: Great!

1777
02:33:57,067 --> 02:34:05,423
MARISHA: But you still have Locate Object, and
then you rub some on you, so you can still maybe

1778
02:34:05,423 --> 02:34:06,447
sense it?

1779
02:34:06,447 --> 02:34:09,838
LAURA: And I would know when it's right on me
because I can sense that much, at least.

1780
02:34:09,838 --> 02:34:12,012
MARISHA: Maybe?

1781
02:34:12,012 --> 02:34:17,104
LIAM: And you can still see everything. Yeah, you
just can't interact with anything.

1782
02:34:17,104 --> 02:34:19,710
LAURA: Put that shit on me, then.

1783
02:34:19,710 --> 02:34:24,326
LIAM: Okay, so I start slathering her up.

1784
02:34:24,326 --> 02:34:31,613
MATT: Okay. As the oil slathers around you, your
vision of the world becomes dark gray and

1785
02:34:31,613 --> 02:34:36,498
colorless. It's very similar to when Frodo puts
the ring on. There's a flickering sense, and the

1786
02:34:36,498 --> 02:34:44,565
world itself seems to be immersed in shadow and
not quite there. You watch as all the skeletons

1787
02:34:44,565 --> 02:34:50,394
that are swarming through the streets and your
brother all become translucent and almost not

1788
02:34:50,394 --> 02:34:53,044
there, like these ghostly visions of them.

1789
02:34:53,044 --> 02:35:00,732
LAURA: I don't know. Is it like Sauron? Is he
going to be able to see me?

1790
02:35:00,732 --> 02:35:02,980
TALIESIN: Hush. Ignore him.

1791
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:06,716
LAURA: Okay. Can I sink into the ground?

1792
02:35:06,716 --> 02:35:08,425
MATT: The ground's hard.

1793
02:35:08,425 --> 02:35:09,789
MARISHA: What?!

1794
02:35:09,789 --> 02:35:10,924
LIAM: Wait.

1795
02:35:10,924 --> 02:35:16,643
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Wait.

1796
02:35:16,643 --> 02:35:18,482
LAURA: The ground is hard.

1797
02:35:18,482 --> 02:35:24,740
LIAM: No, we've forgotten about the 60 fucking
feet again.

1798
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:27,651
LAURA: She's not 60 feet away.

1799
02:35:27,651 --> 02:35:29,808
MATT: You ignore objects and effects that aren't
on the Ethereal Plane.

1800
02:35:29,808 --> 02:35:33,814
LIAM: If you take the ring further than 60 feet
away from me, we're blown.

1801
02:35:33,814 --> 02:35:35,692
MARISHA: But it might not be 60 feet away.

1802
02:35:35,692 --> 02:35:40,267
LAURA: I'll stay 60 feet within the surface of the
earth.

1803
02:35:40,267 --> 02:35:43,232
MARISHA: Do we still have another one of those
potions? You can come with us?

1804
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:51,879
MATT: Actually, no, this is a point of order here:
ignores all objects and effects that aren't on the

1805
02:35:51,879 --> 02:36:01,674
Ethereal Plane. This is complicated.

1806
02:36:01,674 --> 02:36:07,571
MARISHA: This is one of those stupid DND, now we
have to interpret what they mean.

1807
02:36:07,571 --> 02:36:13,314
TRAVIS: It's a DM call on him, I think. Or how he
wants to translate it.

1808
02:36:13,314 --> 02:36:29,691
MATT: So here's the thing. Here's technically what
happens: as the oil begins to be pressed along

1809
02:36:29,691 --> 02:36:36,326
your body, you begin to look around and notice as
your vision goes gray and everything begins to

1810
02:36:36,326 --> 02:36:45,393
fade, <i>everything</i> begins to fade. As in, on the
Ethereal Plane, Thar Amphala, this interpretation

1811
02:36:45,393 --> 02:36:48,902
of this space, is not at this location.

1812
02:36:48,902 --> 02:36:53,700
LAURA: So I would disappear? I would fall?

1813
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:58,193
MATT: Let's see here. This is getting really
wonky.

1814
02:36:58,193 --> 02:37:03,955
LAURA: Can I cancel it once it starts getting on
me and I'm like, this does not seem right?

1815
02:37:03,955 --> 02:37:05,936
TALIESIN: Shit might get really weird now.

1816
02:37:05,936 --> 02:37:07,589
LAURA: I might just be gone.

1817
02:37:07,589 --> 02:37:18,582
MATT: Allowing you to move through objects you
perceive-- no, that's true. It's not there on the

1818
02:37:18,582 --> 02:37:23,531
Ethereal Plane, it's only on this plane. I'm
sorry. This got really confusing. Welcome to DND.

1819
02:37:23,531 --> 02:37:31,500
Thar Amphala, there is no version of it on the
Ethereal Plane, however, which means that

1820
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,799
currently you can pass through the ground.

1821
02:37:33,799 --> 02:37:35,168
LAURA: I can?

1822
02:37:35,168 --> 02:37:36,561
MATT: Yes. My apologies.

1823
02:37:36,561 --> 02:37:41,698
LAURA: I'm on another plane of existence, though?

1824
02:37:41,698 --> 02:37:45,508
MATT: The Ethereal Plane overlaps this one. It
layers it in a similar way that the Shadowfell does.

1825
02:37:45,508 --> 02:37:51,104
TALIESIN: You are actually perceivable? But only
to the things that can perceive.

1826
02:37:51,104 --> 02:37:58,887
LIAM: But the proof is in the pudding because if
that ring were gone from my presence, Vecna would

1827
02:37:58,887 --> 02:38:01,649
be bending me over a barrel right now.

1828
02:38:01,649 --> 02:38:03,511
MATT: Which--

1829
02:38:03,511 --> 02:38:04,820
LIAM: He's doing.

1830
02:38:04,820 --> 02:38:08,291
MATT: As you dissipate in the Ethereal Plane--

1831
02:38:08,291 --> 02:38:13,303
SAM: Poor Ashley.

1832
02:38:13,303 --> 02:38:15,853
ASHLEY: This is so stressful!

1833
02:38:15,853 --> 02:38:18,242
MARISHA: Wait, though. Come on.

1834
02:38:18,242 --> 02:38:22,812
LAURA: I didn't think about the fact that it works
in a different fucking plane.

1835
02:38:22,812 --> 02:38:24,149
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

1836
02:38:24,149 --> 02:38:37,103
MATT: So as you vanish into the space, a little
whisper curls into your ear, Vax'ildan. "Ah, there

1837
02:38:37,103 --> 02:38:51,075
"you are. I've been looking all over for you and
your friends. Welcome." And that's it.

1838
02:38:51,075 --> 02:38:58,051
LIAM: Everybody back to Chicken Town. Chicken
Town! And I click the Boots of Haste, and I start

1839
02:38:58,051 --> 02:39:00,054
booking back.

1840
02:39:00,054 --> 02:39:02,067
SAM: You're abandoning your sister?

1841
02:39:02,067 --> 02:39:03,972
LAURA: No, it's okay! I've got the thing.

1842
02:39:03,972 --> 02:39:08,130
MARISHA: It's me and you now; we got this. We're
good. Go!

1843
02:39:08,130 --> 02:39:10,064
LIAM: You're staying?!

1844
02:39:10,064 --> 02:39:13,470
MARISHA: I'm getting the fucking sword!

1845
02:39:13,470 --> 02:39:20,416
LIAM: I'm hearing this over the earring. I just
heard that. I heard it. Vecna whispered to me, and

1846
02:39:20,416 --> 02:39:23,936
I said that to everybody through the earring. She
shouted back at me.

1847
02:39:23,936 --> 02:39:27,160
MATT: But they don't hear you because they're not
in the same plane with the earrings.

1848
02:39:27,160 --> 02:39:29,279
LIAM: Does she still hear me?

1849
02:39:29,279 --> 02:39:31,073
MATT: No, she doesn't.

1850
02:39:31,073 --> 02:39:34,727
LIAM: But I heard that, so: You're not going to
go?

1851
02:39:34,727 --> 02:39:40,749
MARISHA: I'm getting this sword. I'm here now
under the fucking ground!

1852
02:39:40,749 --> 02:39:43,885
LIAM: I can't talk to you anymore.

1853
02:39:43,885 --> 02:39:45,444
LAURA: I'm just floating downwards.

1854
02:39:45,444 --> 02:39:47,714
MARISHA: I reach up. Can I grab your shin?

1855
02:39:47,714 --> 02:39:49,662
LIAM: I realize Keyleth's not going anywhere and I
plunk down.

1856
02:39:49,662 --> 02:39:53,849
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. Can I hear you, can I see
you? Nothing with her?

1857
02:39:53,849 --> 02:39:55,068
TRAVIS, LIAM, and MATT: No.

1858
02:39:55,068 --> 02:39:56,807
MARISHA: Why did we do this, then?

1859
02:39:56,807 --> 02:39:59,005
TRAVIS: I don't know. Keep going. Keep doing it.

1860
02:39:59,005 --> 02:40:01,210
TALIESIN: Because it's late and this is what's
happening.

1861
02:40:01,210 --> 02:40:07,713
SAM: Back in the mansion, we're all sipping wine
and I'm saying: I know our friends will come back

1862
02:40:07,713 --> 02:40:12,414
to us, and I know that they won't ever lead anyone
here.

1863
02:40:12,414 --> 02:40:15,122
MATT: Okay, make another check.

1864
02:40:15,122 --> 02:40:19,104
LAURA: Can I float or am I stuck on the surface of
the ground?

1865
02:40:19,104 --> 02:40:22,700
MATT: Let's see here. You can move up or down.

1866
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:25,767
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to go down towards where
the sword is.

1867
02:40:25,767 --> 02:40:29,572
MATT: You glide through the ground.

1868
02:40:29,572 --> 02:40:33,673
MARISHA: Is that 12? Okay, all right, that's
actually not too bad. 14.

1869
02:40:33,673 --> 02:40:35,450
MATT: Okay, was that with disadvantage?

1870
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:43,887
MARISHA: Seven.

1871
02:40:43,887 --> 02:40:49,737
MATT: Okay. You're still floundering around. You
have Vax dart off and Vex has vanished.

1872
02:40:49,737 --> 02:40:53,008
LIAM: If she screamed, I stopped once I realized
she wasn't leaving. I stayed.

1873
02:40:53,008 --> 02:40:58,732
MATT: Okay. So are you darting back?

1874
02:40:58,732 --> 02:41:03,558
LIAM: And nobody replied and I stopped because I
doubted it, and I'm waiting.

1875
02:41:03,558 --> 02:41:05,441
MATT: Okay, are you going to stealth?

1876
02:41:05,441 --> 02:41:16,044
LIAM: Yeah, of course, but Vecna's whispering in
my ear. 33 and Pass Without a Trace, so 43.

1877
02:41:16,044 --> 02:41:25,779
MARISHA: Go. You should go. I come over the ear
piece and I say: Vax, you should really go because

1878
02:41:25,779 --> 02:41:30,685
you could compromise all of us by staying here.
You should go.

1879
02:41:30,685 --> 02:41:39,799
TRAVIS: She's currently in ethereal form drifting
down; we should see what happens with that.

1880
02:41:39,799 --> 02:41:46,753
MATT: Your movement speed, at double movement,
would be 60 with the double dash. You're moving 30

1881
02:41:46,753 --> 02:41:51,557
feet per round because when you're moving through
the Ethereal Plane through solid objects and

1882
02:41:51,557 --> 02:41:53,485
matter, it does slow you to half speed.

1883
02:41:53,485 --> 02:41:56,491
LAURA: Can I sense Keyleth at all? I can't see
her, right?

1884
02:41:56,491 --> 02:42:00,881
MATT: You can't see her, you can't sense her, but
you do sense the sword. You sense the direction

1885
02:42:00,881 --> 02:42:07,430
still, because Locate Object is still in effect,
and you're drifting down, down, down. About a

1886
02:42:07,430 --> 02:42:16,986
hundred feet. 150 feet. And then as you head down
to that point, you suddenly emerge and you can see

1887
02:42:16,986 --> 02:42:22,146
a small cavern, maybe ten feet in diameter. Looks
like there's a bit of rubble. Looks like there may

1888
02:42:22,146 --> 02:42:27,807
have been a path that led to here that long
crumbled and was either intentionally collapsed or

1889
02:42:27,807 --> 02:42:32,946
naturally collapsed by the movement of the titan.
And as you come into this ten-foot little cavern

1890
02:42:32,946 --> 02:42:41,345
space, half of the floor is coated in this
brackish green fluid, and the other half is solid rock.

1891
02:42:41,345 --> 02:42:46,097
LAURA: Okay. I keep going towards the sword.

1892
02:42:46,097 --> 02:42:52,519
MATT: Okay. It then takes you at a slight angle
down into the liquid, and now you can see the

1893
02:42:52,519 --> 02:42:57,472
tunnel continues downward. There's a small basin
that changes shape as you go down into this murky

1894
02:42:57,472 --> 02:43:04,112
greenish fluid, down where there's no light. It is
normally pitch black here, but the etherealness

1895
02:43:04,112 --> 02:43:10,252
allows you to take a little bit of the space in.
Looking around, you can see that there is a thick

1896
02:43:10,252 --> 02:43:15,341
residue that is gathered along the edges, and
there at the bottom, you can sense, though you

1897
02:43:15,341 --> 02:43:20,928
cannot see it because it is actually a few inches
beneath the muck, you assume, the sword.

1898
02:43:20,928 --> 02:43:23,617
LAURA: I can't touch it.

1899
02:43:23,617 --> 02:43:24,771
MATT: Correct.

1900
02:43:24,771 --> 02:43:39,386
LAURA: But I know where it is. Can I come up into
the cavern, and you said there was rock

1901
02:43:39,386 --> 02:43:49,992
outcropping that I can stand on? Can I get this
shit off of me, the oil off of me, or am I stuck

1902
02:43:49,992 --> 02:43:51,601
as an ethereal form?

1903
02:43:51,601 --> 02:43:55,307
MATT: This is going to be an interesting
question.

1904
02:43:55,307 --> 02:44:02,760
TRAVIS: It's like LSD, isn't it? It'll take eight
hours to go away.

1905
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:05,986
(laughter)

1906
02:44:05,986 --> 02:44:08,893
MATT: How long does it last on the oil?

1907
02:44:08,893 --> 02:44:10,898
LIAM: I lost the paper, but I'll look it up.

1908
02:44:10,898 --> 02:44:13,752
MATT: I feel like it lasts for an hour. Let me
double check.

1909
02:44:13,752 --> 02:44:15,214
LIAM: Yeah, I think that's what it is.

1910
02:44:15,214 --> 02:44:16,071
LAURA: It lasts--

1911
02:44:16,071 --> 02:44:17,270
LIAM: One hour.

1912
02:44:17,270 --> 02:44:18,805
SAM: Shit. (laughs)

1913
02:44:18,805 --> 02:44:21,897
LIAM: We've got to bail on it and come back for it
later, if at all.

1914
02:44:21,897 --> 02:44:23,574
LAURA: No, not necessarily.

1915
02:44:23,574 --> 02:44:25,231
MATT: Let's see.

1916
02:44:25,231 --> 02:44:29,866
LAURA: I have the stone.

1917
02:44:29,866 --> 02:44:31,428
LIAM: It's ethereal.

1918
02:44:31,428 --> 02:44:35,737
TALIESIN: That's cool.

1919
02:44:35,737 --> 02:44:37,899
LAURA: This could work.

1920
02:44:37,899 --> 02:44:39,670
MARISHA: It could still work.

1921
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:40,975
LAURA: You guys are in the mansion.

1922
02:44:40,975 --> 02:44:42,162
MARISHA: We're cool.

1923
02:44:42,162 --> 02:44:48,186
LAURA: Yeah, we're good. I don't know if there's
anything wrong, so you keep tunneling down and

1924
02:44:48,186 --> 02:44:49,449
I'll wait.

1925
02:44:49,449 --> 02:44:52,310
MATT: All right, make another check.

1926
02:44:52,310 --> 02:44:53,505
MARISHA: Investigation?

1927
02:44:53,505 --> 02:44:54,441
MATT: Yep.

1928
02:44:54,441 --> 02:44:56,975
LAURA: Come on.

1929
02:44:56,975 --> 02:44:58,052
MARISHA: At disadvantage?

1930
02:44:58,052 --> 02:44:59,380
MATT: Yep.

1931
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:04,040
MARISHA: Oh, that's better! 13.

1932
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:10,907
MATT: 13? Okay. You begin to eventually find a
tunnel that appears to be completely packed with

1933
02:45:10,907 --> 02:45:14,272
collapsed loose rock and earth. It's been long
collapsed.

1934
02:45:14,272 --> 02:45:17,013
MARISHA: It's heading downwards?

1935
02:45:17,013 --> 02:45:18,574
MATT: Seems to be at an angle, yeah.

1936
02:45:18,574 --> 02:45:24,024
MARISHA: All right, I'll keep being like, this
seems like a path of least resistance. I'll glide

1937
02:45:24,024 --> 02:45:25,545
through that for a bit.

1938
02:45:25,545 --> 02:45:27,630
MATT: Takes you a little bit. Eventually, your
spell dissipates.

1939
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:29,595
LAURA: It's been an hour?

1940
02:45:29,595 --> 02:45:32,507
MATT: Well, no. The spell lasts for up to ten
minutes.

1941
02:45:32,507 --> 02:45:34,019
LAURA: Oh, the Locate Object, right.

1942
02:45:34,019 --> 02:45:36,278
MATT: Vax, what have you been doing?

1943
02:45:36,278 --> 02:45:41,366
LIAM: I'm paralyzed; I don't know what to do, so
I'm hiding, not doing anything. But how far away

1944
02:45:41,366 --> 02:45:44,774
have we traveled from the building we started at
with the mansion in it?

1945
02:45:44,774 --> 02:45:53,473
MATT: How far have you traveled from the building?
You're about 120 feet, maybe?

1946
02:45:53,473 --> 02:45:54,815
LIAM: That's fine.

1947
02:45:54,815 --> 02:46:02,239
MATT: As you're waiting there paralyzed, the voice
creeps in once again. "But where are all your

1948
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:06,281
"friends? Why are you alone?"

1949
02:46:06,281 --> 02:46:08,987
LIAM: I don't say shit.

1950
02:46:08,987 --> 02:46:20,925
MATT: (chuckles) You eventually break through the
edge and come into the same small cavern that she

1951
02:46:20,925 --> 02:46:24,251
encountered, and you can see the dark green fluid
there.

1952
02:46:24,251 --> 02:46:25,553
LAURA: Keyleth!

1953
02:46:25,553 --> 02:46:27,363
MARISHA: Vex?

1954
02:46:27,363 --> 02:46:30,965
LAURA: Keyleth! I'm right here! Keyleth!

1955
02:46:30,965 --> 02:46:33,154
MARISHA: Vex?

1956
02:46:33,154 --> 02:46:34,889
LAURA: Keyleth! Over here! I'm over here!

1957
02:46:34,889 --> 02:46:35,907
MARISHA: Vex?

1958
02:46:35,907 --> 02:46:36,697
LAURA: Yes!

1959
02:46:36,697 --> 02:46:37,575
MARISHA: Vex?

1960
02:46:37,575 --> 02:46:38,648
LAURA: Yeah!

1961
02:46:38,648 --> 02:46:40,939
MATT: Nothing.

1962
02:46:40,939 --> 02:46:44,637
LAURA: (laughing) How long has it been?

1963
02:46:44,637 --> 02:46:47,585
MARISHA: Can you throw a rock or something?

1964
02:46:47,585 --> 02:46:52,249
LAURA: I can't do shit! I can't interact with
anything! I'm just fucking standing here! 15

1965
02:46:52,249 --> 02:46:54,109
minutes. This is the best.

1966
02:46:54,109 --> 02:46:55,708
MARISHA: It's been 15 minutes?

1967
02:46:55,708 --> 02:46:57,274
MATT: Since she took the oil, yeah.

1968
02:46:57,274 --> 02:46:59,103
TALIESIN: So you found a cavern.

1969
02:46:59,103 --> 02:47:00,341
MARISHA: I found a cavern.

1970
02:47:00,341 --> 02:47:08,121
LAURA: I described where it was to you, so I
described that it was murky water. Muck is what I

1971
02:47:08,121 --> 02:47:10,581
described to you. It's surrounded by silt, is what
it felt like.

1972
02:47:10,581 --> 02:47:12,236
MATT: Okay. So what do you do, Keyleth?

1973
02:47:12,236 --> 02:47:15,818
SAM: We need Whoopi Goldberg.

1974
02:47:15,818 --> 02:47:16,893
TALIESIN: Don't we always.

1975
02:47:16,893 --> 02:47:18,251
SAM: "Molly, you in danger, girl."

1976
02:47:18,251 --> 02:47:22,489
LAURA: Keyleth, it's right here! It's right here!
It might be poisonous water; I'm not sure what it

1977
02:47:22,489 --> 02:47:25,007
is. Can you hear me? It's right here.

1978
02:47:25,007 --> 02:47:34,020
MARISHA: I'm going to try to investigate this
cavern, I guess, as much as I can. Am I still at

1979
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:41,525
disadvantage now that I'm in a cavern? That's
cool. That's better. God fucking hell.

1980
02:47:41,525 --> 02:47:43,592
TALIESIN: That's a terrible roll. I'm so sorry.

1981
02:47:43,592 --> 02:47:44,675
MARISHA: Nine.

1982
02:47:44,675 --> 02:47:48,080
MATT: It looks like a cavern, filled partially
with fluid.

1983
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:57,025
MARISHA: I come over and I say: Vax, where is your
sister?

1984
02:47:57,025 --> 02:48:01,757
LIAM: She is on another plane. She's in the
Ethereal Plane. We did the oil thing. We didn't

1985
02:48:01,757 --> 02:48:02,991
think it through.

1986
02:48:02,991 --> 02:48:04,563
MARISHA: What do you mean we didn't think it
through?

1987
02:48:04,563 --> 02:48:07,101
LIAM: Vecna's whispering in my ear. By the way,
where is he?

1988
02:48:07,101 --> 02:48:09,305
MATT: Still on Entropis.

1989
02:48:09,305 --> 02:48:10,589
LIAM: Still in his spot?

1990
02:48:10,589 --> 02:48:12,348
MARISHA: So she's not with you?

1991
02:48:12,348 --> 02:48:16,711
LIAM: No, she slipped down into the ground. She's
probably near you somewhere?

1992
02:48:16,711 --> 02:48:19,677
MARISHA: What? Vex?!

1993
02:48:19,677 --> 02:48:23,957
LIAM: We lubed her up in ethereal oil, and she
went down your direction.

1994
02:48:23,957 --> 02:48:26,580
LAURA: Vecna can probably hear him.

1995
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:34,950
MATT: Vax. You begin to hear loud wings flapping
louder and louder outside and above, a different

1996
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:37,276
sound than the wings of a gloomstalker.

1997
02:48:37,276 --> 02:48:41,582
LIAM: Keyleth, you know where to go. I have to
run. And I click the Boots of Haste and I start

1998
02:48:41,582 --> 02:48:42,673
bolting towards the mansion.

1999
02:48:42,673 --> 02:48:45,415
MARISHA: I'm not going to leave without your
sister! Bye.

2000
02:48:45,415 --> 02:48:49,184
MATT: So are you moving stealthily or are you
bolting?

2001
02:48:49,184 --> 02:48:51,758
LIAM: I'm going to stealth.

2002
02:48:51,758 --> 02:48:55,834
SAM: And here's cucumber salad, everyone.

2003
02:48:55,834 --> 02:48:59,638
TRAVIS: Why is it always green?

2004
02:48:59,638 --> 02:49:02,623
TALIESIN: Is it considered a salad if it's mostly
cucumber in there?

2005
02:49:02,623 --> 02:49:04,142
SAM: There's some dill.

2006
02:49:04,142 --> 02:49:07,792
TALIESIN: How is this different than a sliced
pickle?

2007
02:49:07,792 --> 02:49:09,174
MARISHA: I really like dill.

2008
02:49:09,174 --> 02:49:12,918
TALIESIN: You're in a cavern. You can't have any
dill.

2009
02:49:12,918 --> 02:49:17,718
MARISHA: I'm speaking as myself right now. Marisha
really likes dill.

2010
02:49:17,718 --> 02:49:21,418
TALIESIN: What does Keyleth think of dill? We
don't know, do we?! We'll never know.

2011
02:49:21,418 --> 02:49:23,020
MATT: All right. Vax.

2012
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:35,342
LIAM: Sorry. I'm freaked out. 35. Am I still Pass
Without a Traced at this point? 35.

2013
02:49:35,342 --> 02:49:37,822
TRAVIS: He's an astronaut without a ship.

2014
02:49:37,822 --> 02:49:39,229
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

2015
02:49:39,229 --> 02:49:45,145
MATT: Okay. As you're stealthing, moving along,
you can glance over or keep focusing forward.

2016
02:49:45,145 --> 02:49:47,083
LIAM: No, I'm going to keep going.

2017
02:49:47,083 --> 02:49:51,888
MATT: All right, you keep going. You move, move.
You can hear the wings; you can hear this horrible

2018
02:49:51,888 --> 02:50:06,206
raspy, sounds like a whetstone being slid across
steel, slowed down with bass. It's this (croaks).

2019
02:50:06,206 --> 02:50:13,070
LIAM: As I'm probably getting farther away, I say:
Kiki, stay underground, please. And keep going.

2020
02:50:13,070 --> 02:50:20,032
MATT: Okay. Eventually, you find your way back to
the household, seemingly not directly followed,

2021
02:50:20,032 --> 02:50:31,730
but you hear the wings are circling, more
localized to where this house is. Keyleth, what

2022
02:50:31,730 --> 02:50:33,115
are you doing?

2023
02:50:33,115 --> 02:50:35,675
MARISHA: I'm in a cavern alone?

2024
02:50:35,675 --> 02:50:37,706
MATT: Yeah.

2025
02:50:37,706 --> 02:50:39,808
SAM: "That's my turn. "

2026
02:50:39,808 --> 02:50:42,112
(laughter)

2027
02:50:42,112 --> 02:50:49,232
MARISHA: Vex! Vex, give me a sign? Vex! Throw a
pebble. If you can hear me, throw a pebble!

2028
02:50:49,232 --> 02:50:53,192
LAURA: I sit down on the ground Indian-style.

2029
02:50:53,192 --> 02:51:05,761
MARISHA: Okay. I'm also working this out as me and
Keyleth. Vax told me: stay underground; made a bad

2030
02:51:05,761 --> 02:51:17,225
call; sister's underground near me; I know where
to go. He thinks I know where to go. I go over to

2031
02:51:17,225 --> 02:51:23,001
the muck, the greenish liquid, and throw a rock
in. What happens?

2032
02:51:23,001 --> 02:51:27,288
MATT: It's a little syrupy, but it definitely
splashes.

2033
02:51:27,288 --> 02:51:30,125
MARISHA: Does it look like acid? Does it look like
what we're used to with acid?

2034
02:51:30,125 --> 02:51:37,580
MATT: It looks brown, green, sludgy. It doesn't
look like the typical acid you've encountered, but

2035
02:51:37,580 --> 02:51:38,957
it looks like a liquid.

2036
02:51:38,957 --> 02:51:46,866
MARISHA: I just dip in my toe in the cold water.
Just dip my toe in.

2037
02:51:46,866 --> 02:51:52,015
MATT: You take two points of acid damage. It is a
caustic liquid.

2038
02:51:52,015 --> 02:51:53,208
MARISHA: It's acid.

2039
02:51:53,208 --> 02:51:55,161
LAURA: It's acid.

2040
02:51:55,161 --> 02:51:58,774
MARISHA: It's acid. No one can hear me, but I'm
confirming it's acid.

2041
02:51:58,774 --> 02:52:00,603
LAURA: I can hear you. It is definitely acid.

2042
02:52:00,603 --> 02:52:04,369
MARISHA: I feel so alone.

2043
02:52:04,369 --> 02:52:06,303
LIAM: I've stepped in the door, by the way, of the
mansion.

2044
02:52:06,303 --> 02:52:08,421
MARISHA: Two points of acid damage?

2045
02:52:08,421 --> 02:52:13,160
SAM: How's it going outside?

2046
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:18,413
LIAM: Not well. Not very well. It's fucked. He
knows we're here. He doesn't know where you are or

2047
02:52:18,413 --> 02:52:21,092
where I am right now, but he knows that we're
here.

2048
02:52:21,092 --> 02:52:22,971
SAM: He knows where you are?

2049
02:52:22,971 --> 02:52:24,566
LIAM: No, not anymore.

2050
02:52:24,566 --> 02:52:26,190
SAM: Did he know where you were?

2051
02:52:26,190 --> 02:52:27,185
LIAM: He did.

2052
02:52:27,185 --> 02:52:29,699
SAM: And did he know that you came over here?

2053
02:52:29,699 --> 02:52:31,440
LIAM: Probably.

2054
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:36,113
SAM: So he knows where we are, so we have to leave
now.

2055
02:52:36,113 --> 02:52:40,645
TALIESIN: Well, we're at least relatively safe
here for a moment until they figure out a way to

2056
02:52:40,645 --> 02:52:42,389
find us and then get rid of us.

2057
02:52:42,389 --> 02:52:48,738
SAM: Yep. But then we have to leave or be ready to
leave at a moment's notice. Or we should maybe

2058
02:52:48,738 --> 02:52:49,775
leave right now.

2059
02:52:49,775 --> 02:52:52,057
LIAM: No, we wait a little bit. I think that they
can get back.

2060
02:52:52,057 --> 02:52:54,595
SAM: And then what? Then we all have to leave.

2061
02:52:54,595 --> 02:52:56,874
MARISHA: I go deeper.

2062
02:52:56,874 --> 02:52:59,624
MATT: Okay. So you dive into the liquid?

2063
02:52:59,624 --> 02:53:02,494
MARISHA: Not into the liquid! Just through the
stone, going deeper.

2064
02:53:02,494 --> 02:53:07,685
MATT: Okay. You coast along the outside and you
can sense that you're traveling on the outskirts

2065
02:53:07,685 --> 02:53:12,783
of this descending tunnel where the acidic liquid
is encased, and eventually it rounds out.

2066
02:53:12,783 --> 02:53:15,091
MARISHA: I do another sword check.

2067
02:53:15,091 --> 02:53:16,580
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2068
02:53:16,580 --> 02:53:19,070
MARISHA: Am I at disadvantage again?

2069
02:53:19,070 --> 02:53:20,580
MATT: No, because you know what you're looking
for.

2070
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:27,422
MARISHA: That's good! Don't fuck me, Gil! 16.

2071
02:53:27,422 --> 02:53:32,008
MATT: Okay. You reach out and you grab forth, and
you feel a few things that you grab and as you

2072
02:53:32,008 --> 02:53:39,369
sense them, you poke your head through, which in
the process of doing, you do suffer six points of

2073
02:53:39,369 --> 02:53:47,554
acid damage, and your hands find bones. And
glancing through a little bit into the space, you

2074
02:53:47,554 --> 02:53:56,427
can see the entire bottom of this basin is bones.
Probably a good four to five feet of stacked

2075
02:53:56,427 --> 02:54:02,810
bones. This has been used as a means of disposing
of unwanted things.

2076
02:54:02,810 --> 02:54:13,415
MARISHA: Disposing people. I keep looking. I can't
leave without a Vex.

2077
02:54:13,415 --> 02:54:23,402
LAURA: I'm fucking sitting on the ground; there's
nothing else I can do.

2078
02:54:23,402 --> 02:54:26,719
MARISHA: Eight.

2079
02:54:26,719 --> 02:54:29,748
MATT: Four points of acid damage, and you're
finding nothing, but rummaging through.

2080
02:54:29,748 --> 02:54:31,609
TALIESIN: Keep rummaging.

2081
02:54:31,609 --> 02:54:39,769
MARISHA: I'm desperate. I keep going. Can I go
around and deeper? Can I follow this path a little bit?

2082
02:54:39,769 --> 02:54:43,231
MATT: Yeah, you can. On the bottom of it or
another side? What do you want to do?

2083
02:54:43,231 --> 02:54:48,651
MARISHA: I'm going to try and go under it. I'm
going to think, if there's a pit of bodies that

2084
02:54:48,651 --> 02:54:53,506
have been thrown away, that maybe a sword is
somewhere buried under this pit of bodies.

2085
02:54:53,506 --> 02:54:55,756
MATT: Go for it. Make another investigation
check.

2086
02:54:55,756 --> 02:55:00,673
MARISHA: Fucking hell. This is so nerve-wracking.
Six.

2087
02:55:00,673 --> 02:55:02,903
MATT: You take ten points of acid damage.

2088
02:55:02,903 --> 02:55:09,329
TRAVIS: You could just wait it out.

2089
02:55:09,329 --> 02:55:12,919
MARISHA: Yeah, but Keyleth.

2090
02:55:12,919 --> 02:55:15,671
MATT: Make another check if you want to.

2091
02:55:15,671 --> 02:55:32,965
MARISHA: Every few minutes, I go: Vex? I'm
constantly, Vex? Vex? <i>Vax</i>? Vex? Still looking

2092
02:55:32,965 --> 02:55:35,484
under this pit of people. 12.

2093
02:55:35,484 --> 02:55:46,512
MATT: You suffer eight points of acid damage, and you
reach through and your hand finally hits something

2094
02:55:46,512 --> 02:55:52,467
hard and cold within the silt. It's stuck in the
muck, but there's something there that is not like

2095
02:55:52,467 --> 02:55:54,712
the rest of the bone. It feels metal.

2096
02:55:54,712 --> 02:56:00,649
MARISHA: Okay. I try and earth clear.

2097
02:56:00,649 --> 02:56:02,866
SAM: Earth clear? (laughs)

2098
02:56:02,866 --> 02:56:05,722
MARISHA: Earth clear! Clear eyes!

2099
02:56:05,722 --> 02:56:07,121
MATT: Make a strength check.

2100
02:56:07,121 --> 02:56:08,699
SAM: Everclear.

2101
02:56:08,699 --> 02:56:11,066
TALIESIN: Wow, it's been a long time.

2102
02:56:11,066 --> 02:56:13,174
MARISHA: This is stressful.

2103
02:56:13,174 --> 02:56:20,715
MARISHA: Oh! Natural 18. 23? Wait, no. 24!

2104
02:56:20,715 --> 02:56:22,518
MATT: Okay. You take seven points of acid damage.

2105
02:56:22,518 --> 02:56:23,663
MARISHA: Seven?

2106
02:56:23,663 --> 02:56:30,354
MATT: As you reach out and you grab, and you can
now glance through and see this is the hilt of a

2107
02:56:30,354 --> 02:56:36,383
blade, and it's stuck in the muck. You yank it
free; you pull it out of the muck, and it's free

2108
02:56:36,383 --> 02:56:42,078
at this point. You're surrounded by skeletal
bones, and you feel the fingers pulling at you and

2109
02:56:42,078 --> 02:56:46,567
tearing, and you look around you as a wall of
these corpses, these broken corpses, all begin to

2110
02:56:46,567 --> 02:56:47,933
grasp at you--

2111
02:56:47,933 --> 02:56:51,655
MARISHA: I go up to the cavern! I'm out! I'm
bailing with this.

2112
02:56:51,655 --> 02:56:54,704
MATT: You can't pull this into the rock with you.

2113
02:56:54,704 --> 02:56:57,034
TRAVIS: We discussed this.

2114
02:56:57,034 --> 02:57:00,642
MATT: It's metal; it doesn't come into the rock.
It doesn't earthglide with you. So you have to

2115
02:57:00,642 --> 02:57:02,717
glide up with your hand out.

2116
02:57:02,717 --> 02:57:07,226
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I'm beating as I go upwards.

2117
02:57:07,226 --> 02:57:11,191
MATT: Make another strength check to see if you
can break the grapple of the undead hands that are

2118
02:57:11,191 --> 02:57:13,724
now grabbing and trying to hold you there at the
bottom of the basin.

2119
02:57:13,724 --> 02:57:16,330
LAURA: Can I see any of this happening?

2120
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:17,670
MARISHA: Okay, 21.

2121
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:21,589
MATT: No. 21? You do manage to break free. You
suffer another five points of acid damage and

2122
02:57:21,589 --> 02:57:27,111
begin to earthglide your way up. You get about
halfway up and suffer another nine points of acid

2123
02:57:27,111 --> 02:57:28,514
damage.

2124
02:57:28,514 --> 02:57:35,227
MARISHA: 84, 70, 76. Okay. Yeah, still going.

2125
02:57:35,227 --> 02:57:39,632
MATT: And you eventually emerge from the top as
you suffer another seven points of acid damage and

2126
02:57:39,632 --> 02:57:44,433
manage to earthglide. You watch as all of a sudden
the water separates and bursts, and you watch as

2127
02:57:44,433 --> 02:57:50,251
her earth elemental form emerges, its hand coming
up through the water, clutching a blackened blade.

2128
02:57:50,251 --> 02:57:53,205
MARISHA: Vex!

2129
02:57:53,205 --> 02:58:02,822
LAURA: Okay. Shit. Trinket's still in my necklace.
I wonder if I bamf him out-- he wasn't covered in

2130
02:58:02,822 --> 02:58:06,874
oil-- if he'd be in the regular plane or if he
would be in the Ethereal Plane.

2131
02:58:06,874 --> 02:58:12,302
TALIESIN: You may never see your bear-- nope.
Playing devil's advocate. Cosmic bear.

2132
02:58:12,302 --> 02:58:16,496
MATT: (laughing) Cosmic bear?

2133
02:58:16,496 --> 02:58:18,886
MARISHA: Does he become a constellation after
that?

2134
02:58:18,886 --> 02:58:22,125
TALIESIN: He'll look like Eternity from Marvel
Comics. He'll be this star bear--

2135
02:58:22,125 --> 02:58:25,950
LAURA: Would he be an ethereal bear, or would be
bamf out in the regular plane?

2136
02:58:25,950 --> 02:58:27,335
LIAM: That's a big risk.

2137
02:58:27,335 --> 02:58:29,968
MARISHA: How much time has it been?

2138
02:58:29,968 --> 02:58:32,228
MATT: It's been about 30 minutes.

2139
02:58:32,228 --> 02:58:36,224
LAURA: I don't know how this shit works. I'm going
to bamf Trinket out of the necklace.

2140
02:58:36,224 --> 02:58:37,614
TALIESIN: <i>What</i>?!

2141
02:58:37,614 --> 02:58:41,250
LAURA: I don't know how this fucking shit works.
I'm going to try to bamf Trinket out of the

2142
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:42,498
necklace.

2143
02:58:42,498 --> 02:58:45,387
MARISHA: Come on, Trinket. Come on. Keyleth sees
Trinket. Keyleth sees Trinket!

2144
02:58:45,387 --> 02:58:47,425
SAM: Best episode ever.

2145
02:58:47,425 --> 02:58:49,886
MARISHA: Come on, damn it!

2146
02:58:49,886 --> 02:59:00,405
MATT: As the cold sense of worry comes over you,
you clutch the necklace and there's a flash as you

2147
02:59:00,405 --> 02:59:10,940
watch Trinket's form burst from the necklace, gray
and shaded. And <i>you</i> see as Trinket pops out of

2148
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:15,893
nowhere. By the way, between the two of you, you
guys are pretty crammed into here to not be in the

2149
02:59:15,893 --> 02:59:19,891
acid right now. You're both like (grunts).
(confused bear noises)

2150
02:59:19,891 --> 02:59:27,153
MARISHA: (bear noises) Where's Vex? Vex?

2151
02:59:27,153 --> 02:59:32,373
MATT: He's sniffing around.

2152
02:59:32,373 --> 02:59:34,911
LAURA: I was basically trying to let her know
where I was.

2153
02:59:34,911 --> 02:59:49,697
MARISHA: I saw him appear suddenly, right? Okay.
Vex? Okay, I pet Trinket for an indeterminate

2154
02:59:49,697 --> 02:59:55,217
amount of time. I wait.

2155
02:59:55,217 --> 02:59:58,368
LAURA: Can you chill? Right here. Because this is
where I am. Can we wait it out?

2156
02:59:58,368 --> 03:00:00,250
MATT: You can. How long can you hold your form?

2157
03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:01,923
MARISHA: Half my level.

2158
03:00:01,923 --> 03:00:05,967
MATT: Yeah, so you're here for a while. Okay. So
you guys sit and wait, carefully thinking,

2159
03:00:05,967 --> 03:00:10,690
contemplating. Over the next 30 minutes or so,
eventually you begin to watch as Vex'ahlia's form

2160
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:12,897
begins to emerge once more into this plane.

2161
03:00:12,897 --> 03:00:14,192
SAM: She's back!

2162
03:00:14,192 --> 03:00:18,384
LAURA: This was the stupidest idea we've ever--

2163
03:00:18,384 --> 03:00:25,761
MARISHA and LAURA: (sobbing in relief)

2164
03:00:25,761 --> 03:00:28,388
LAURA: Trinket, get back in the necklace.

2165
03:00:28,388 --> 03:00:31,318
MATT: Trinket is licking your face intensely.

2166
03:00:31,318 --> 03:00:33,956
LAURA: You're such a good bear. Okay.

2167
03:00:33,956 --> 03:00:36,145
MARISHA: I want to drop my form. Is this it?

2168
03:00:36,145 --> 03:00:42,993
LAURA: That's it. But here's the thing, should you
glide back to the mansion, I stone back to the

2169
03:00:42,993 --> 03:00:45,952
mansion with the sword? Okay, give me the sword.

2170
03:00:45,952 --> 03:00:49,972
MARISHA: Okay. I give her the sword. I have the
sword. Is it the sword? It is the sword.

2171
03:00:49,972 --> 03:00:52,526
MATT: It's what you saw, yeah.

2172
03:00:52,526 --> 03:00:54,897
(cheering)

2173
03:00:54,897 --> 03:00:56,763
MARISHA and LAURA: Okay!

2174
03:00:56,763 --> 03:01:00,557
MARISHA: I know where the mansion is, right?
Vaguely?

2175
03:01:00,557 --> 03:01:01,811
LAURA: You can glide back to the mansion.

2176
03:01:01,811 --> 03:01:04,608
MATT: It might take you a little while, but you
can find your way back.

2177
03:01:04,608 --> 03:01:06,974
MARISHA: Okay, go? Okay, I'll see you soon.

2178
03:01:06,974 --> 03:01:16,497
LAURA: Okay. Good luck. And I'm going to think of
the stone. I already put Trinket back in the

2179
03:01:16,497 --> 03:01:17,942
necklace.

2180
03:01:17,942 --> 03:01:22,169
MATT: Okay. You concentrate for a minute as the
stone's energy fills you. You flash and all of a

2181
03:01:22,169 --> 03:01:24,210
sudden you're standing over the other stone--

2182
03:01:24,210 --> 03:01:32,748
MARISHA: And before she leaves, I say: Do a little
tap dance, so I know, on the outside where the

2183
03:01:32,748 --> 03:01:34,243
mansion is. I know where the mansion is, though.

2184
03:01:34,243 --> 03:01:35,543
MATT: Yeah. You know where it is.

2185
03:01:35,543 --> 03:01:37,484
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine. Okay.

2186
03:01:37,484 --> 03:01:41,216
LAURA: Okay. All right, I pick up the stones and
go in the mansion.

2187
03:01:41,216 --> 03:01:42,912
MATT: Okay, you grab the stones and go in the
mansion.

2188
03:01:42,912 --> 03:01:46,830
MARISHA: I doggie-paddle back.

2189
03:01:46,830 --> 03:01:55,622
MATT: As you make your way slowly in that
direction, you hear a little voice whisper in your

2190
03:01:55,622 --> 03:02:04,322
ear. "It's not going to help you."

2191
03:02:04,322 --> 03:02:08,061
(laughter)

2192
03:02:08,061 --> 03:02:09,779
LAURA: Oh, he would've--

2193
03:02:09,779 --> 03:02:19,398
MATT: Eventually, you slowly make your way to the
building, and as you emerge from the inside, you

2194
03:02:19,398 --> 03:02:27,960
can hear the loud flapping of wings nearby,
jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

2195
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:31,362
MARISHA: I go in the mansion as fast as I can.

2196
03:02:31,362 --> 03:02:35,768
MATT: All right. You dart into the mansion. You
guys watch as Keyleth's elemental form bursts into

2197
03:02:35,768 --> 03:02:37,607
the mansion space with the rest of you.

2198
03:02:37,607 --> 03:02:39,414
LIAM: Oh my god.

2199
03:02:39,414 --> 03:02:43,283
I run forward and hug the big fucking stone
giant like a cat.

2200
03:02:43,283 --> 03:02:47,419
LAURA: This was really stupid. We were so dumb.
This was so dumb.

2201
03:02:47,419 --> 03:02:49,288
SAM: Is she back? Do you have the sword?

2202
03:02:49,288 --> 03:02:50,448
LAURA: I have the sword, yeah.

2203
03:02:50,448 --> 03:02:52,034
MARISHA: I drop form.

2204
03:02:52,034 --> 03:02:54,117
LAURA: There you go, Grog.

2205
03:02:54,117 --> 03:02:55,429
LIAM: We are blown.

2206
03:02:55,429 --> 03:02:58,645
SAM: We have to move. The safehouse has been
compromised.

2207
03:02:58,645 --> 03:03:01,935
LAURA: Okay, so here's the thing. He knows we're
here.

2208
03:03:01,935 --> 03:03:04,924
LIAM: He can't see us anymore, but he knows--

2209
03:03:04,924 --> 03:03:08,208
LAURA: He knows that you two are here. He doesn't
know the rest of us are.

2210
03:03:08,208 --> 03:03:13,387
MARISHA: He knows we're in this vicinity. I think
once we get into the mansion, he doesn't know an

2211
03:03:13,387 --> 03:03:15,572
exact place, so as long as they don't figure out
the mansion?

2212
03:03:15,572 --> 03:03:20,595
SAM: He doesn't know we're in here, but he knows
where the mansion is and he will come to dispel

2213
03:03:20,595 --> 03:03:27,843
it. So we have to get out of this mansion and
either make another mansion somewhere else or go

2214
03:03:27,843 --> 03:03:31,112
to somewhere else from inside this mansion right
now.

2215
03:03:31,112 --> 03:03:32,562
LAURA: We can Plane Shift.

2216
03:03:32,562 --> 03:03:34,394
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift us.

2217
03:03:34,394 --> 03:03:36,080
LAURA: Will you be able to get us back here,
though?

2218
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:37,656
MARISHA: If we rest.

2219
03:03:37,656 --> 03:03:40,025
SAM: To this exact spot?

2220
03:03:40,025 --> 03:03:42,919
LAURA: Or to Thar Amphala?

2221
03:03:42,919 --> 03:03:49,564
MARISHA: If we leave from a mansion, I can
teleport us back to a mansion with some pretty

2222
03:03:49,564 --> 03:03:57,562
accurate-- it'd be the difference between the spa
or the kitchen. But if it's gone, then it's gone.

2223
03:03:57,562 --> 03:04:05,280
But then I could still bamf us back to Thar
Amphala or whatever other city that we came out of.

2224
03:04:05,280 --> 03:04:07,713
TALIESIN: Worst case scenario, we can leave the
gate stone outside.

2225
03:04:07,713 --> 03:04:15,496
MATT: There's a moment with a faint, whining,
high-pitched sound and this sudden thrust. There's

2226
03:04:15,496 --> 03:04:24,876
a sudden thrust of vacuum as the mansion around
you dissipates and you're all plopped onto the

2227
03:04:24,876 --> 03:04:30,273
ground outside of the cupboard where across,
crawled upward partway into the building, you see

2228
03:04:30,273 --> 03:04:36,446
a skeletal dragon standing there, its claws jammed
into the inside, its wings open, and you see

2229
03:04:36,446 --> 03:04:39,634
standing on the back of the dragon, finger
forward--

2230
03:04:39,634 --> 03:04:41,128
MARISHA: Plane Shift!

2231
03:04:41,128 --> 03:04:48,585
MATT: I know. Finger forward, finishing the Dispel
Magic she had cast, Delilah Briarwood, with behind

2232
03:04:48,585 --> 03:05:01,142
her, darkened armor, arms around: Sylas, grinning.
As she goes, "Oh. Glad you could make it.

2233
03:05:01,142 --> 03:05:05,230
"No, wait!" As soon as you gather, she's going to
attempt to Counterspell.

2234
03:05:05,230 --> 03:05:06,677
LAURA: Oh god.

2235
03:05:06,677 --> 03:05:07,967
ASHLEY: No, don't do it!

2236
03:05:07,967 --> 03:05:09,334
LAURA: Don't do it!

2237
03:05:09,334 --> 03:05:12,678
MATT: (chuckles) So Plane Shift is 7th-level,
right?

2238
03:05:12,678 --> 03:05:18,859
MARISHA: No, but I am doing it as an 8th-level
because I'm out-- I'm doing it as an 8th-level.

2239
03:05:18,859 --> 03:05:27,029
MATT: Okay, good to know. So where are you Plane
Shifting to?

2240
03:05:27,029 --> 03:05:28,626
MARISHA: Feywild.

2241
03:05:28,626 --> 03:05:29,766
MATT: Feywild, okay.

2242
03:05:29,766 --> 03:05:33,330
MARISHA: Do we have a city in the Feywild that we
know of that's safe-ish?

2243
03:05:33,330 --> 03:05:36,640
LAURA: Go to the pond.

2244
03:05:36,640 --> 03:05:38,337
MATT: That's a natural eight.

2245
03:05:38,337 --> 03:05:40,911
MARISHA: The pond! Fuck you! The pond!

2246
03:05:40,911 --> 03:05:47,064
MATT: As she attempts to counter the spell, even
at a higher level, it fizzles, unable to break

2247
03:05:47,064 --> 03:05:50,982
through. And all of you, as you watch her hand
extend and Sylas about to dismount--

2248
03:05:50,982 --> 03:05:52,648
TRAVIS: Say it.

2249
03:05:52,648 --> 03:05:53,929
MATT: (whoosh)

2250
03:05:53,929 --> 03:05:55,929
(yelling)

2251
03:05:55,929 --> 03:05:57,940
MATT: You find yourselves pulled out of Thar
Amphala.

2252
03:05:57,940 --> 03:06:05,569
(yelling)

2253
03:06:05,569 --> 03:06:06,693
TALIESIN: Fuck the Briarwoods!

2254
03:06:06,693 --> 03:06:10,019
MARISHA: Why did we do this?!

2255
03:06:10,078 --> 03:06:12,116
LAURA: That sword better be the most amazing
sword.

2256
03:06:12,116 --> 03:06:16,202
TALIESIN: We're practically gods. Let's be fair.
We're so fucked.

2257
03:06:16,202 --> 03:06:18,924
TRAVIS: Oh god. Jesus.

2258
03:06:18,924 --> 03:06:27,771
MATT: You guys all plop down, your feet hitting
the somewhat wet, grassy ground of the swamp where

2259
03:06:27,771 --> 03:06:31,252
you-- You said the pools where you first emerged
last time?

2260
03:06:31,252 --> 03:06:33,139
LAURA: Yeah, where the water elemental is.

2261
03:06:33,139 --> 03:06:37,896
MATT: Yeah. Where the nymph was. You guys all land
in these pools. Looking around, you can see the

2262
03:06:37,896 --> 03:06:43,525
darkened wood over you. The sound of crickets and
nearby insects fill the air, and for the first

2263
03:06:43,525 --> 03:06:49,560
time in a long time, though your blood pumping
would not tell you, a stillness and a peace in the

2264
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:51,318
vicinity around you.

2265
03:06:51,318 --> 03:06:57,659
TALIESIN: Oh god, we should turn off our cell
phones more often. This feels really good. Oh god.

2266
03:06:57,659 --> 03:07:01,772
LIAM: Really cool.

2267
03:07:01,772 --> 03:07:04,208
TRAVIS: Immediate perception check around us.

2268
03:07:04,208 --> 03:07:06,015
MATT: Make a perception check.

2269
03:07:06,015 --> 03:07:08,480
TRAVIS: Oh, 17!

2270
03:07:08,480 --> 03:07:10,852
SAM: Music just got supes loud.

2271
03:07:10,852 --> 03:07:13,853
TRAVIS: 17.

2272
03:07:13,853 --> 03:07:18,453
MATT: All right. Glance about your vicinity. You
see nothing that has noticed your presence or

2273
03:07:18,453 --> 03:07:20,338
seems to be of interest to you at the moment.

2274
03:07:20,338 --> 03:07:26,382
TRAVIS: You all figure out what we're doing next.
And I put the bloodaxe away and I start

2275
03:07:26,382 --> 03:07:31,498
concentrating on this giant greatsword.

2276
03:07:31,498 --> 03:07:33,028
LAURA: Are we fucked?

2277
03:07:33,028 --> 03:07:36,024
MARISHA: Did we leave behind a gate stone? Did
someone say we were leaving one?

2278
03:07:36,024 --> 03:07:37,530
LAURA: No, I took all the gate stones.

2279
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:39,842
TALIESIN: We thought about leaving one as a marker
for us.

2280
03:07:39,842 --> 03:07:41,313
LAURA: Yeah, but it doesn't go through planes.

2281
03:07:41,313 --> 03:07:48,183
MATT: As you concentrate on the cold metal of the
weapon, a different but still familiar sense

2282
03:07:48,183 --> 03:07:49,478
creeps in.

2283
03:07:49,478 --> 03:07:53,624
MARISHA: Oh no.

2284
03:07:53,624 --> 03:07:56,666
MATT: "I get the sense this isn't the first
time."

2285
03:07:56,666 --> 03:08:01,471
SAM: Wait. What?

2286
03:08:01,471 --> 03:08:04,252
TRAVIS: Well. You always remember your first.

2287
03:08:04,252 --> 03:08:10,058
MATT: "I also sense we have a similar goal."

2288
03:08:10,058 --> 03:08:16,661
TRAVIS: Could you be a little bit more specific?

2289
03:08:16,661 --> 03:08:19,077
(laughter)

2290
03:08:19,077 --> 03:08:29,300
LIAM: We all see this, right? He's not snuck off,
right? I'm going to come and sit next to him and

2291
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:36,497
watch. What's up, buddy? Just keep doing your
thing. I'm ten feet away. I'm not breathing down

2292
03:08:36,497 --> 03:08:38,142
your neck. You all right?

2293
03:08:38,142 --> 03:08:48,418
TRAVIS: Are you hearing anything? Aces.

2294
03:08:48,418 --> 03:08:57,818
(laughter)

2295
03:08:57,818 --> 03:08:59,692
MATT: "The lich must die."

2296
03:08:59,692 --> 03:09:01,334
TRAVIS: The witch?

2297
03:09:01,334 --> 03:09:02,742
MATT: "The <i>lich</i>."

2298
03:09:02,742 --> 03:09:10,019
TRAVIS: Oh, the lich. Yeah. Are you talking about
Vecna?

2299
03:09:10,019 --> 03:09:12,509
MATT: "Yes."

2300
03:09:12,509 --> 03:09:15,033
(laughter)

2301
03:09:15,033 --> 03:09:21,374
TRAVIS: Then yes, we do share similar goals. I
don't know if you can hear me very well. Your

2302
03:09:21,374 --> 03:09:23,044
voice is <i>barely</i> there.

2303
03:09:23,044 --> 03:09:31,340
MATT: "Oh no." So are you inspecting it, or are
you attuning to it?

2304
03:09:31,340 --> 03:09:34,465
TRAVIS: I'm attuning! I'm locking it in.

2305
03:09:34,465 --> 03:09:37,430
LIAM: I'm going to assume I have deduced somewhat
what is going on here.

2306
03:09:37,430 --> 03:09:41,829
MATT: Yeah, he's talking to his weapon. You have
all seen this before, and it's as disconcerting

2307
03:09:41,829 --> 03:09:44,077
now as it was last time.

2308
03:09:44,077 --> 03:09:46,994
TRAVIS: Hey. Hi.

2309
03:09:46,994 --> 03:09:49,429
LIAM: Hey, man, you do you.

2310
03:09:49,429 --> 03:09:51,114
TRAVIS: I'm not even trying to hide it this time.

2311
03:09:51,114 --> 03:09:54,400
LAURA: You can definitely hear the sword?

2312
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:56,244
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anybody else?

2313
03:09:56,244 --> 03:09:57,674
ALL: No.

2314
03:09:57,674 --> 03:09:58,773
TRAVIS: What?

2315
03:09:58,773 --> 03:10:00,132
ASHLEY: What's it saying?

2316
03:10:00,132 --> 03:10:06,264
TRAVIS: Oh! It was saying that we have similar
goals and that the witch must die. The lich is

2317
03:10:06,264 --> 03:10:13,577
Vecna. Lich. The <i>lich.</i> It's very emphatic about
the lich, meaning Vecna, and it's going to die.

2318
03:10:13,577 --> 03:10:20,846
MATT: "His secrets, his followers, all of it must
topple. You will be my instrument."

2319
03:10:20,846 --> 03:10:26,921
TRAVIS: Apparently, I'm going to be an instrument.
He's going to play me to topple the followers and

2320
03:10:26,921 --> 03:10:28,357
his secrets.

2321
03:10:28,357 --> 03:10:32,191
ASHLEY: What does it want from you in return?

2322
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:42,255
TRAVIS: That's a good question, Pike! (whispering)
What do you require from me in return?

2323
03:10:42,255 --> 03:10:54,558
MATT: "Just wield me. Spill blood for me. Bring me
to the Undying King and cut his throat with my

2324
03:10:54,558 --> 03:10:58,786
"blade. That's all I ask. That's all I need."

2325
03:10:58,786 --> 03:11:12,650
TRAVIS: He really doesn't ask much. Just average
run-of-the-mill fight stuff. Be true to thy

2326
03:11:12,650 --> 03:11:17,260
friend. This one is nothing to worry about.

2327
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:20,017
ASHLEY: Okay.

2328
03:11:20,017 --> 03:11:22,176
MATT: It's still currently embedded in its
scabbard.

2329
03:11:22,176 --> 03:11:28,279
TRAVIS: Oh. Reception problems. Hold on.

2330
03:11:28,279 --> 03:11:33,231
LAURA: I like that you grab it by the blade.

2331
03:11:33,231 --> 03:11:35,584
SAM: Weapons training.

2332
03:11:35,584 --> 03:11:37,452
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm proficient.

2333
03:11:37,452 --> 03:11:41,551
MATT: You hear the sword go: "It's been so long."

2334
03:11:41,551 --> 03:11:47,974
LIAM: I'm going to Bless Grog right now. It's all
over you, buddy.

2335
03:11:47,974 --> 03:11:51,258
MATT: Make a charisma saving throw.

2336
03:11:51,258 --> 03:12:04,605
LIAM: Plus two from me, plus 1d4 from Bless. Plus
two, plus 1d4.

2337
03:12:04,605 --> 03:12:08,192
TRAVIS: Yeah, but minus two for my fucking curse.

2338
03:12:08,192 --> 03:12:09,695
LAURA: So it's balanced.

2339
03:12:09,695 --> 03:12:11,762
TRAVIS: 12.

2340
03:12:11,762 --> 03:12:14,133
MATT: 12? Okay.

2341
03:12:14,133 --> 03:12:16,257
TRAVIS: It's great.

2342
03:12:16,257 --> 03:12:21,121
MATT: Oh man.

2343
03:12:21,121 --> 03:12:25,302
LAURA: Oh no! Did we just lose Grog?

2344
03:12:25,302 --> 03:12:33,691
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, that
the attunement is successful.

2345
03:12:33,691 --> 03:12:37,071
TALIESIN: That is the most frightening thing--

2346
03:12:37,071 --> 03:12:39,132
MARISHA: Does it have to be, though?

2347
03:12:39,132 --> 03:12:45,629
SAM: He's getting dice. A lot of dice.

2348
03:12:45,629 --> 03:12:47,907
MATT: All right.

2349
03:12:47,907 --> 03:12:54,788
SAM: A lot of dice.

2350
03:12:54,788 --> 03:13:08,377
MATT: You suffer 38 points of psychic damage. Your
vision goes cloudy. You guys watch as his skin

2351
03:13:08,377 --> 03:13:17,154
color goes from his general stone gray to a more
pale white. You watch as his physical body becomes

2352
03:13:17,154 --> 03:13:29,405
more gaunt. The jowls sink in slightly, and his
eyes turn a little red around the iris. Your

2353
03:13:29,405 --> 03:13:37,914
vision goes a bit dark, and the sword goes:
"Blood. I need blood. Give me blood. I'm so

2354
03:13:37,914 --> 03:13:41,934
"hungry." You find yourself standing up with the
blade out in front of you.

2355
03:13:41,934 --> 03:13:47,385
TRAVIS: Guys, I don't feel so great.

2356
03:13:47,385 --> 03:13:50,014
MATT: Make two attacks against Vax.

2357
03:13:50,014 --> 03:13:51,593
TRAVIS: That's who I was going to attack.

2358
03:13:51,593 --> 03:13:53,572
SAM: Vax or Vex?

2359
03:13:53,572 --> 03:13:56,078
MATT: Vax. He's the closest one.

2360
03:13:56,078 --> 03:13:59,991
TRAVIS: I didn't say reckless. Would he make them
reckless?

2361
03:13:59,991 --> 03:14:03,540
MATT: Not at the moment, no. He's not familiar
with your capabilities yet.

2362
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:05,936
TRAVIS: 21.

2363
03:14:05,936 --> 03:14:10,465
LIAM: Yes.

2364
03:14:10,465 --> 03:14:15,710
MATT: It's a longsword, so roll 1d8.

2365
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:20,147
TRAVIS: 1d8. Not raging.

2366
03:14:20,147 --> 03:14:23,894
LIAM: Wait, I'll use my last luck of the day to
make him reroll that.

2367
03:14:23,894 --> 03:14:26,069
TRAVIS: The damage or to hit?

2368
03:14:26,069 --> 03:14:27,353
LIAM: To hit.

2369
03:14:27,353 --> 03:14:31,117
TRAVIS: It's worse. 18.

2370
03:14:31,117 --> 03:14:32,601
LIAM: Doesn't hit.

2371
03:14:32,601 --> 03:14:34,175
MATT: Second strike.

2372
03:14:34,175 --> 03:14:39,251
TRAVIS: That's way worse. That's a 16.

2373
03:14:39,251 --> 03:14:46,230
MATT: You dodge both blows as Grog goes and swings
at you twice with the longsword.

2374
03:14:46,230 --> 03:14:48,441
LIAM: I disengage and jump back 15 feet.

2375
03:14:48,441 --> 03:14:50,624
LAURA: Grog! What are you doing?

2376
03:14:50,624 --> 03:14:51,906
TALIESIN: Give him some distance.

2377
03:14:51,906 --> 03:14:55,622
TRAVIS: I'm going to be totally full front
here. The sword needs blood.

2378
03:14:55,622 --> 03:15:00,211
LIAM: We can get that for you, just not from
inside us.

2379
03:15:00,211 --> 03:15:02,379
TRAVIS: I feel like it's trying to take it from
me.

2380
03:15:02,379 --> 03:15:05,839
MATT: Who's closer to Grog right now, between the
two of you?

2381
03:15:05,839 --> 03:15:07,377
TRAVIS: You jumped in front of him?

2382
03:15:07,377 --> 03:15:09,671
MATT: Two attacks on Vex, please.

2383
03:15:09,671 --> 03:15:15,721
LAURA: (shouting) Wait, Kas! Is this Kas? Are you
Kas? Kas, this is counterproductive. This is

2384
03:15:15,721 --> 03:15:20,550
counterproductive! We're all going after Vecna!
This is so stupid! You are ruining your chance of

2385
03:15:20,550 --> 03:15:22,611
killing Vecna by attacking us.

2386
03:15:22,611 --> 03:15:24,626
MATT: What was it?

2387
03:15:24,626 --> 03:15:26,207
TRAVIS: 27.

2388
03:15:26,207 --> 03:15:29,303
MATT: Roll 1d8. Add your strength modifier.

2389
03:15:29,303 --> 03:15:31,525
TRAVIS: Ten.

2390
03:15:31,525 --> 03:15:37,913
MATT: So you take ten points of slashing damage.
As the blade arcs across the front of your sister,

2391
03:15:37,913 --> 03:15:42,408
you see a spray of blood. Make a second attack.

2392
03:15:42,408 --> 03:15:46,359
TRAVIS: That hits.

2393
03:15:46,359 --> 03:15:49,629
MATT: Roll another d8.

2394
03:15:49,629 --> 03:15:52,918
TRAVIS: Oh, that's only a nine.

2395
03:15:52,918 --> 03:15:58,927
MATT: Nine damage. As she reels back from the
first strike, the second one cuts across the

2396
03:15:58,927 --> 03:16:04,647
shoulder and clavicle area, down the arm. As
another spray of blood hits, you pull back and

2397
03:16:04,647 --> 03:16:08,464
watch as the blade is now currently drenched in
Vex's blood.

2398
03:16:08,464 --> 03:16:11,508
TRAVIS: It's actually ten because I had to reroll
ones and twos.

2399
03:16:11,508 --> 03:16:13,322
LAURA: You're a fucking dick.

2400
03:16:13,322 --> 03:16:20,699
MATT: There you go. As the second attack comes to
a halt, you guys are watching him carve into Vex.

2401
03:16:20,699 --> 03:16:30,837
The blood on the edge of the blade seeps into it,
and your tunnel vision subsides, and you take a

2402
03:16:30,837 --> 03:16:38,428
breath. You hear this audible (sigh) from the
blade, as you have control of yourself once more.

2403
03:16:38,428 --> 03:16:39,608
TRAVIS: DÃ©ja vu.

2404
03:16:39,608 --> 03:16:41,414
LAURA: Your sword is a dick. Tell him he's a
dick.

2405
03:16:41,414 --> 03:16:46,124
TRAVIS: Now, listen. This is an ally. You're all
right, yeah? You're okay.

2406
03:16:46,124 --> 03:16:50,375
LAURA: I punch Grog across face.

2407
03:16:50,375 --> 03:16:56,244
MATT: Okay, make an attack. Add your strength
modifier.

2408
03:16:56,244 --> 03:17:02,668
LAURA: With my strength modifier? 14.

2409
03:17:02,668 --> 03:17:05,403
MATT: So she (crack) hits you in the jaw.

2410
03:17:05,403 --> 03:17:06,417
TRAVIS: Is it minus?

2411
03:17:06,417 --> 03:17:08,906
LAURA: It's minus.

2412
03:17:08,906 --> 03:17:10,757
MATT: It goes, (quiet punch).

2413
03:17:10,757 --> 03:17:12,620
LAURA: Act like it hurt, you fuck!

2414
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:14,120
TRAVIS: (deadpan) Ow.

2415
03:17:14,120 --> 03:17:19,147
(laughter)

2416
03:17:19,310 --> 03:17:21,244
LIAM: Why are you not attacking us anymore?

2417
03:17:21,244 --> 03:17:26,429
(shouting)

2418
03:17:26,429 --> 03:17:29,483
TRAVIS: What?! This is the biggest card <i>ever</i>!

2419
03:17:29,483 --> 03:17:31,977
LIAM: That's a novel!

2420
03:17:31,977 --> 03:17:35,086
TALIESIN: That's a fucking dice tray. That's not a
card!

2421
03:17:35,086 --> 03:17:37,534
MARISHA: That is the biggest blackest sword!

2422
03:17:37,534 --> 03:17:42,039
(laughter)

2423
03:17:42,039 --> 03:17:44,090
LAURA: Oh, the sword is a dick! That's funny.

2424
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:49,710
MATT: It all came full circle. It's the episode
title there. The sword is a dick.

2425
03:17:49,710 --> 03:17:52,243
SAM: Swords and dicks.

2426
03:17:52,243 --> 03:17:53,955
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2427
03:17:53,955 --> 03:17:55,396
LAURA: Good? Bad?

2428
03:17:55,396 --> 03:18:00,479
TRAVIS: Good. Totally good. As with all good
things, <i>comes with a bit of risk</i>.

2429
03:18:00,479 --> 03:18:05,354
TALIESIN: What are we if not risk-conscious?

2430
03:18:05,354 --> 03:18:10,949
TRAVIS: Yeah, all the time. Even Pike would say
this is worth it.

2431
03:18:10,949 --> 03:18:13,839
LAURA: Pike, do you think it's worth it?

2432
03:18:13,839 --> 03:18:22,669
ASHLEY: Desperate times come for desperate
measures. Call for desperate measures, rather.

2433
03:18:22,669 --> 03:18:30,569
Here's the thing: if it comes down to it, it gets
bad, I can pull you out of there, hopefully. It's

2434
03:18:30,569 --> 03:18:39,145
not off to a good start. You slashed up Vex.

2435
03:18:39,145 --> 03:18:43,807
LIAM: Big man, why did you stop attacking after
you cut my sister?

2436
03:18:43,807 --> 03:18:49,640
TRAVIS: I got the feeling it needs to be fed blood
often.

2437
03:18:49,640 --> 03:18:53,654
MARISHA: Look, it doesn't have any blood on it
anymore. It sucked it all in.

2438
03:18:53,654 --> 03:19:02,538
TRAVIS: Funny thing, that's what Craven Edge used
to do, as well. Oh, what do I call you?

2439
03:19:02,611 --> 03:19:15,282
MATT: There's a long pause before it thinks. "I've
not taken a name but the one that's been given.

2440
03:19:15,282 --> 03:19:22,637
"But in honor of my last master, just call me
Kas."

2441
03:19:22,637 --> 03:19:31,928
TRAVIS: Vox Machina, meet Kas. Kas, try not to
hurt them.

2442
03:19:31,928 --> 03:19:34,983
MATT: "I make no promises."

2443
03:19:34,983 --> 03:19:38,727
TRAVIS: He makes no promises. He's very
forthcoming. This is really nice compared to the

2444
03:19:38,727 --> 03:19:40,038
last guy.

2445
03:19:40,038 --> 03:19:41,183
MARISHA: Hi, Kas!

2446
03:19:41,183 --> 03:19:49,500
TRAVIS: He said hi. He's like: I like your
freckles, Keyleth.

2447
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:51,223
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, Kas.

2448
03:19:51,223 --> 03:19:52,700
MATT: "Take me to the lich."

2449
03:19:52,700 --> 03:19:58,348
TRAVIS: Okay, can I put you back in your
scabbard?

2450
03:19:58,348 --> 03:20:06,072
MATT: "Are you taking the scabbard to the Undying
King's innards?"

2451
03:20:06,072 --> 03:20:10,476
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. We're going to rock that body
real hard.

2452
03:20:10,476 --> 03:20:12,348
MATT: "Very well."

2453
03:20:12,348 --> 03:20:21,231
TRAVIS: Holy shit. I mean, there's motivated
people in the world, and then there's this totally

2454
03:20:21,231 --> 03:20:25,231
rocking motherfucker. He's of a single purpose.
It's incredible.

2455
03:20:25,231 --> 03:20:26,671
SAM: Just wants to kill Vecna?

2456
03:20:26,671 --> 03:20:30,757
TRAVIS: Just wants to fuck him up, Swiss cheese
style. And his whole family.

2457
03:20:30,757 --> 03:20:32,330
SAM: What else is he into?

2458
03:20:32,330 --> 03:20:34,409
LAURA: He's into slicing us up.

2459
03:20:34,409 --> 03:20:38,075
LIAM: Blood. He wants blood?

2460
03:20:38,075 --> 03:20:49,221
TRAVIS: It's good that you have me here, Vax. My
experience with these sort of weapons. They are

2461
03:20:49,221 --> 03:21:03,132
fueled by various-- I need a big word-- various
fuels, and I feel like he needs blood to be good.

2462
03:21:03,132 --> 03:21:08,799
LIAM: Could you do me a favor, then? Do you think,
instead of attacking my twin sister next time--

2463
03:21:08,799 --> 03:21:12,749
and I take Whisper and I go-- can I feed him for
you?

2464
03:21:12,749 --> 03:21:14,786
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2465
03:21:14,786 --> 03:21:18,385
MATT: You take 1d4 points of damage.

2466
03:21:18,385 --> 03:21:26,361
TRAVIS: That was my plan, but we could do it right
now. Just to be careful. You want to drip some on

2467
03:21:26,361 --> 03:21:28,463
the blade and see if he likes the flavor?

2468
03:21:28,463 --> 03:21:31,062
LIAM: I've already started. (dripping)

2469
03:21:31,062 --> 03:21:38,887
MATT: It seeps into the dark, almost pitch-black
metal. You hear the inhale of the blade as it

2470
03:21:38,887 --> 03:21:41,219
takes in the blood and seems to devour it.

2471
03:21:41,219 --> 03:21:42,769
TRAVIS: Guess he digs the other white meat.

2472
03:21:42,769 --> 03:21:44,579
MARISHA: Does he ever get full?

2473
03:21:44,579 --> 03:21:50,293
TRAVIS: No, I've asked that before, man. You don't
want to go that way.

2474
03:21:50,293 --> 03:21:51,707
LAURA: It went bad before.

2475
03:21:51,707 --> 03:21:54,379
TRAVIS: Yeah. It went all anime.

2476
03:21:54,379 --> 03:22:04,960
LIAM: Goddamn it, Travis. Then you and me have an
agreement here, rather than wait until he comes

2477
03:22:04,960 --> 03:22:08,478
knocking. In the meantime, could I feed him once
an hour or so?

2478
03:22:08,478 --> 03:22:14,257
TRAVIS: Yeah. In fact, any time I take him out of
the scabbard, why don't you hang real close. I

2479
03:22:14,257 --> 03:22:16,213
might have to plunge him into your thigh or
something.

2480
03:22:16,213 --> 03:22:17,941
LIAM: That seems extreme.

2481
03:22:17,941 --> 03:22:19,683
TRAVIS: I don't know how hungry he is.

2482
03:22:19,683 --> 03:22:24,124
MATT: Just a note, this conversation is strange,
since you're staring at Grog and his eyes are

2483
03:22:24,124 --> 03:22:28,779
burning a little red. The visual change is still
that way.

2484
03:22:28,779 --> 03:22:31,861
LAURA: Are you always like that now?

2485
03:22:31,861 --> 03:22:33,489
TRAVIS: Do I need some eye drops?

2486
03:22:33,489 --> 03:22:35,822
LAURA: Grog, you need to eat something. You look
really gaunt.

2487
03:22:35,822 --> 03:22:37,569
TALIESIN: Let's get him a steak or something.

2488
03:22:37,569 --> 03:22:39,051
SAM: You look like a methhead.

2489
03:22:39,051 --> 03:22:47,002
MATT: He's still muscular. All the skin is
pulled taut against the bone.

2490
03:22:47,002 --> 03:22:52,593
LAURA: I'm really glad that we're here in the
Feywild, and it's great.

2491
03:22:52,593 --> 03:22:56,107
LIAM: Vasselheim is getting fucked royally now, or
soon.

2492
03:22:56,107 --> 03:22:58,358
LAURA: What are we doing?

2493
03:22:58,358 --> 03:23:02,202
SAM: I want to see one of those before-and-after
meth photos of Grog.

2494
03:23:02,202 --> 03:23:05,074
(laughter)

2495
03:23:05,074 --> 03:23:09,011
MARISHA: This is Grog. This is Grog on Sword of
Kas.

2496
03:23:09,011 --> 03:23:11,992
TALIESIN: Sword of Kas, not even once.

2497
03:23:11,992 --> 03:23:15,648
(laughter)

2498
03:23:15,648 --> 03:23:19,123
LIAM: The straightest edge.

2499
03:23:19,123 --> 03:23:21,002
MARISHA: Just say no.

2500
03:23:21,002 --> 03:23:24,861
LAURA: (singing) D.A.R.E to keep a Grog off Kas!

2501
03:23:24,861 --> 03:23:26,988
TALIESIN: Wow, way to bring that back.

2502
03:23:26,988 --> 03:23:28,707
MATT: So what's the plan?

2503
03:23:28,707 --> 03:23:36,774
SAM: What is the plan? We're in the Feywild, where
there's werewolves and pixies.

2504
03:23:36,774 --> 03:23:38,141
TALIESIN: And your father.

2505
03:23:38,141 --> 03:23:39,603
LAURA: No, not anymore.

2506
03:23:39,603 --> 03:23:51,184
MARISHA: I've been thinking about this, just a
little. The Feywild, as you know, when we've left

2507
03:23:51,184 --> 03:23:56,016
before and when we go back, sometimes time gets a
little wibbly-wobbly.

2508
03:23:56,016 --> 03:24:01,967
SAM: I don't know that. I aged but didn't know
why.

2509
03:24:01,967 --> 03:24:03,880
MATT: That's true, you didn't.

2510
03:24:03,880 --> 03:24:06,930
LAURA: Time gets a little wonky here.

2511
03:24:06,930 --> 03:24:09,880
MARISHA: There were some things going on with you
at the time.

2512
03:24:09,880 --> 03:24:15,504
TALIESIN: Can we pinpoint when we get back?

2513
03:24:15,504 --> 03:24:17,794
LAURA: Is there a way to control it?

2514
03:24:17,794 --> 03:24:20,006
MARISHA: No.

2515
03:24:20,006 --> 03:24:22,648
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you've been thinking
about it, and the answer is no.

2516
03:24:22,648 --> 03:24:32,216
MARISHA: We can't, but do you remember
our friend Garmelie-slash-Artagan?

2517
03:24:32,216 --> 03:24:34,037
SAM: He was not our friend. He was an asshole.

2518
03:24:34,037 --> 03:24:35,211
LAURA: No, he was great!

2519
03:24:35,211 --> 03:24:36,555
MARISHA: He was cool.

2520
03:24:36,555 --> 03:24:38,590
SAM: Wasn't he the guy who sketched us and was
creepy?

2521
03:24:38,590 --> 03:24:43,670
LAURA: Yeah, he was funny, and he also helped us,
and he also enjoyed us because we were weird.

2522
03:24:43,670 --> 03:24:48,821
LIAM: Basically, it also describes you, so I feel
like you should be understanding.

2523
03:24:48,821 --> 03:24:52,858
SAM: Fair point. I lost my house today, all right? 
So go easy.

2524
03:24:52,858 --> 03:24:55,608
LAURA: You can get it later, right?

2525
03:24:55,608 --> 03:24:56,789
SAM: It's insured.

2526
03:24:56,789 --> 03:24:58,182
LAURA: Okay.

2527
03:24:58,182 --> 03:25:03,713
TALIESIN: We can also maybe have a second to
breathe and have a second to maybe identify that

2528
03:25:03,713 --> 03:25:05,068
stone we took.

2529
03:25:05,068 --> 03:25:06,633
SAM: We took a stone?

2530
03:25:06,633 --> 03:25:08,016
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got this blue crystal.

2531
03:25:08,016 --> 03:25:09,982
LAURA: Maybe Artagan can identify it.

2532
03:25:09,982 --> 03:25:13,377
TRAVIS: I take out the blue crystal. Is it still
pulsing?

2533
03:25:13,377 --> 03:25:15,792
SAM: Wait, why are we finding this Artagan
fellow?

2534
03:25:15,792 --> 03:25:21,900
MARISHA: Well, he's an archfey. He told us he was
an archfey. They more or less control this realm,

2535
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:26,450
or at least have strong dominance over it. He
might be able to help us make sure that we're

2536
03:25:26,450 --> 03:25:29,375
going back in minutes as opposed to years.

2537
03:25:29,375 --> 03:25:31,374
LAURA: You think he could do that?

2538
03:25:31,374 --> 03:25:34,449
SAM: He can control the land? The powers of the
land?

2539
03:25:34,449 --> 03:25:36,694
LAURA: I don't know if he's going to be able to
control time, though.

2540
03:25:36,694 --> 03:25:46,119
TALIESIN: It's entirely possible that we could
return to where we were with only a few minutes

2541
03:25:46,119 --> 03:25:47,130
having passed.

2542
03:25:47,130 --> 03:25:50,288
LAURA: It's also possible that we'll return and
years have gone by and Vecna is already a god.

2543
03:25:50,288 --> 03:25:53,098
MARISHA: We have to talk to Artagan.

2544
03:25:53,098 --> 03:25:54,606
TALIESIN: Plead our case.

2545
03:25:54,606 --> 03:25:57,688
MARISHA: I bet he can help us. I don't know,
though.

2546
03:25:57,688 --> 03:26:02,633
TALIESIN: I don't think it's in anybody's interest
to have Vecna controlling any of the planes.

2547
03:26:02,633 --> 03:26:06,326
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Maybe he'll want to help
if he can?

2548
03:26:06,326 --> 03:26:08,344
TALIESIN: Yes. Perhaps.

2549
03:26:08,344 --> 03:26:11,502
LIAM: It's too much of a risk to go back normally
anyway. We might as well find him.

2550
03:26:11,502 --> 03:26:15,675
MARISHA: If he can help us, might still be able to
take a rest.

2551
03:26:15,675 --> 03:26:20,921
TALIESIN: Sleep. And return minutes later.

2552
03:26:20,921 --> 03:26:24,692
LAURA: (gasps) I'm going to cry. That would be so
wonderful.

2553
03:26:24,692 --> 03:26:27,455
MARISHA: (whimpering) I need to sleep so bad. I'm
so tired.

2554
03:26:27,455 --> 03:26:29,900
TALIESIN: You definitely have been sleep cranky.

2555
03:26:29,900 --> 03:26:35,218
LAURA: (stuttering) It was a thing. I'm so sorry
that Vecna found us. The ethereal thing was a

2556
03:26:35,218 --> 03:26:38,362
backfire.

2557
03:26:38,362 --> 03:26:40,340
LIAM: A series of bad decisions.

2558
03:26:40,340 --> 03:26:44,349
MARISHA: (whimpering) I felt so alone. Let's not
split the party, you guys.

2559
03:26:44,349 --> 03:26:46,283
TALIESIN: No, never again.

2560
03:26:46,283 --> 03:26:48,356
LAURA: How do we get a hold of--

2561
03:26:48,356 --> 03:26:49,685
SAM: Garmelie?

2562
03:26:49,685 --> 03:26:52,089
ASHLEY: I could send a message.

2563
03:26:52,089 --> 03:26:54,133
LAURA: To Garmelie?

2564
03:26:54,133 --> 03:26:55,320
LIAM: How do you mean?

2565
03:26:55,320 --> 03:26:57,538
ASHLEY: Well, I could use Sending.

2566
03:26:57,538 --> 03:26:59,208
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

2567
03:26:59,208 --> 03:27:05,831
ASHLEY: Yeah. And we could write a little
something and say hello.

2568
03:27:05,831 --> 03:27:10,564
SAM: You don't say it, you have to write it down?

2569
03:27:10,564 --> 03:27:12,945
ASHLEY: Well, I have it. Let's look at this.

2570
03:27:12,945 --> 03:27:15,761
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to? And spray it with
perfume?

2571
03:27:15,761 --> 03:27:19,193
ASHLEY: Yeah, put a kiss on it.

2572
03:27:19,193 --> 03:27:22,895
LIAM: He also might like a naughty doodle.

2573
03:27:22,895 --> 03:27:24,777
LAURA: Yeah, draw a little naughty doodle, Pike.

2574
03:27:24,777 --> 03:27:28,438
ASHLEY: Do a naughty doodle? Okay.

2575
03:27:28,438 --> 03:27:30,272
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it.

2576
03:27:30,272 --> 03:27:34,062
SAM: Ashley, will you draw something and show it
to us on the camera?

2577
03:27:34,062 --> 03:27:37,943
ASHLEY: Okay. I can't draw, but all right.

2578
03:27:37,943 --> 03:27:40,511
(laughter)

2579
03:27:40,511 --> 03:27:41,822
MATT: I'm so excited.

2580
03:27:41,822 --> 03:27:45,012
TALIESIN: This made everything worthwhile, right
here.

2581
03:27:45,012 --> 03:27:46,942
LIAM: The New York Yankees? That's terrible.

2582
03:27:46,942 --> 03:27:54,228
(laughter)

2583
03:27:54,228 --> 03:27:56,645
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. This is already going bad.

2584
03:27:56,645 --> 03:28:00,102
LAURA: Is it boobies? Is it penis?

2585
03:28:00,102 --> 03:28:02,067
SAM: I think it's a vag.

2586
03:28:02,067 --> 03:28:05,035
TALIESIN: Travis, are you going to be reading that
weapon for the next week, aren't you?

2587
03:28:05,035 --> 03:28:06,923
LAURA: It's a novel.

2588
03:28:06,923 --> 03:28:11,379
SAM: Is this thing going to kill you? Can you read
it?

2589
03:28:11,379 --> 03:28:14,824
TALIESIN: Not all of it. That's the rest of the
show if he reads it.

2590
03:28:14,824 --> 03:28:20,039
MARISHA: Can it actually kill Vecna, even though
Vecna said it won't do us any good?

2591
03:28:20,039 --> 03:28:22,412
TRAVIS: It's going to put me a lot closer to doing
that.

2592
03:28:22,412 --> 03:28:24,127
LAURA: To killing Vecna?

2593
03:28:24,127 --> 03:28:28,849
MARISHA: Because Vecna was all like, "Oh, you
can't beat me!"

2594
03:28:28,849 --> 03:28:35,637
TRAVIS: The only weapon that does as much shit as
this does, the closest thing to it is your staff.

2595
03:28:35,637 --> 03:28:40,335
Your Vestige. This thing is bonkers.

2596
03:28:40,335 --> 03:28:43,270
LAURA: Let me see it!

2597
03:28:43,270 --> 03:28:45,392
ASHLEY: Okay.

2598
03:28:45,392 --> 03:28:47,900
LAURA: Okay, what did you draw? What did you draw,
Pike?

2599
03:28:47,900 --> 03:28:56,826
ASHLEY: I can't draw, and if only one of the
amazing artists were here. So okay, it's a penis.

2600
03:28:56,826 --> 03:29:00,366
(laughter)

2601
03:29:00,366 --> 03:29:01,917
SAM and TALIESIN: "Cum see us--"

2602
03:29:01,917 --> 03:29:04,214
MATT and ASHLEY: "--4 a good time."

2603
03:29:04,214 --> 03:29:05,552
TALIESIN: "Time" circled.

2604
03:29:05,552 --> 03:29:07,673
MATT: "This is Vox Machina, by the way."

2605
03:29:07,673 --> 03:29:13,649
(laughter and applause)

2606
03:29:13,649 --> 03:29:18,008
LAURA: He's a happy penis! Oh, it's so great!

2607
03:29:18,008 --> 03:29:20,920
MARISHA: It looks like a condomed penis.

2608
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:29,651
MATT: It's not too bad. As you suddenly hear a
voice behind you, Vex, and you turn to look and

2609
03:29:29,651 --> 03:29:33,045
Artagan is right there behind you.

2610
03:29:33,045 --> 03:29:35,244
SAM: He came that fast?!

2611
03:29:35,244 --> 03:29:39,628
MARISHA: Don't tell people that, Artagan.

2612
03:29:39,628 --> 03:29:47,978
MATT: "I'll keep it a secret best I can. Best I
can." He stands there before you, his yellowish-green

2613
03:29:47,978 --> 03:29:55,886
attire with the high collar and his wild, orangish
hair framing his face like a lion's mane. His

2614
03:29:55,886 --> 03:30:05,896
pale, elfin, fey complexion. Smiles as he puts the
hands together. "Well. Show me a good time."

2615
03:30:05,896 --> 03:30:09,501
(nervous laughter)

2616
03:30:09,501 --> 03:30:10,977
LAURA: Okay.

2617
03:30:10,977 --> 03:30:12,389
SAM: I unzip my pants.

2618
03:30:12,389 --> 03:30:13,935
(laughter)

2619
03:30:13,935 --> 03:30:15,199
MATT: He doesn't flinch.

2620
03:30:15,199 --> 03:30:18,053
LAURA: I shimmy.

2621
03:30:18,053 --> 03:30:19,936
LIAM: Give me 12 minutes and I'll have 
this armor off.

2622
03:30:19,936 --> 03:30:25,721
TALIESIN: I am legit out of sheer panic going to
take off all of my clothes and dive straight into

2623
03:30:25,721 --> 03:30:35,949
that lake. That little pond? I'm washing. I have
had a nervous breakdown. I am like, yeah, no,

2624
03:30:35,949 --> 03:30:38,012
we're naked into the water.

2625
03:30:38,012 --> 03:30:42,063
MATT: "Well, that is considered good manners,
definitely."

2626
03:30:42,063 --> 03:30:44,573
LIAM: 11 minutes from now, I'm going to be joining
you, Percival.

2627
03:30:44,573 --> 03:30:48,645
TALIESIN: I'm in there, yelling into the water
right now because it's been too much.

2628
03:30:48,645 --> 03:30:52,954
MATT: "How have you been? What's going on?"

2629
03:30:52,954 --> 03:30:57,832
(yelling and laughter)

2630
03:30:57,832 --> 03:31:09,541
LAURA: It's been a little crazy, actually. We were
hoping that maybe we could seek your aid? Please?

2631
03:31:09,541 --> 03:31:11,641
MATT: "Define the request, please."

2632
03:31:11,641 --> 03:31:17,720
LAURA: Okay, so you know how time is weird when we
go back to the other plane of existence?

2633
03:31:17,720 --> 03:31:20,868
MATT: "Weird? Time is <i>fun</i> when you go back."

2634
03:31:20,868 --> 03:31:30,641
LAURA: Exactly. It's so much fun. We're in dire
straits over there. The world is about to be taken

2635
03:31:30,641 --> 03:31:38,671
over by an asshole that wants to be a god, and
we're trying to kill him, and we're here now, and

2636
03:31:38,671 --> 03:31:43,945
we're hoping that we can hang out here and rest
and go back and only a few seconds have passed?

2637
03:31:43,945 --> 03:31:45,617
Maybe a minute or two?

2638
03:31:45,617 --> 03:31:49,696
SAM: Is that something you can control?

2639
03:31:49,696 --> 03:31:55,457
MATT: (chuckles) "Are you telling me that you
would stumble into this space unannounced, summon

2640
03:31:55,457 --> 03:32:01,580
"me here under the pretense of a good time, and
then request me to bend the very essence of time

2641
03:32:01,580 --> 03:32:08,597
"passage between my plane and yours?"

2642
03:32:08,597 --> 03:32:10,410
MARISHA: We can show you a good time first.

2643
03:32:10,410 --> 03:32:12,242
LAURA: We definitely do want to show you a good
time about it.

2644
03:32:12,242 --> 03:32:14,687
LIAM: And what is your idea of a good time?
Unbutton, unbutton.

2645
03:32:14,687 --> 03:32:22,010
TRAVIS: And we certainly don't expect that to be
accomplished without something given in return. Of

2646
03:32:22,010 --> 03:32:23,350
course.

2647
03:32:23,350 --> 03:32:26,392
MATT: "Now we're talking. I could help."

2648
03:32:26,392 --> 03:32:27,931
LAURA: You can do that?

2649
03:32:27,931 --> 03:32:31,505
MATT: "More or less."

2650
03:32:31,505 --> 03:32:36,210
SAM: And what would you request?

2651
03:32:36,210 --> 03:32:52,039
MATT: "Well... You all dress very differently than
the last time we met. You're doing well for

2652
03:32:52,039 --> 03:32:53,503
"yourselves, then?"

2653
03:32:53,503 --> 03:32:55,303
LIAM: It's been a hard day.

2654
03:32:55,303 --> 03:32:56,903
LAURA: We have a bakery.

2655
03:32:56,903 --> 03:32:58,157
MATT: "That's quaint."

2656
03:32:58,157 --> 03:33:01,476
MARISHA: In comparison to the world events--

2657
03:33:01,476 --> 03:33:04,108
SAM: I'm pretending to be a mage right now, so.

2658
03:33:04,108 --> 03:33:11,580
TRAVIS: We fought of a bunch of ancient dragons.
We've established order back in our realm.

2659
03:33:11,580 --> 03:33:14,530
LIAM: I'm unkillable for a while.

2660
03:33:14,530 --> 03:33:16,781
MATT: "<i>That's</i> fun."

2661
03:33:16,781 --> 03:33:25,435
LIAM: (high-pitched) Well.

2662
03:33:25,509 --> 03:33:30,104
SAM: I'm a crime lord. I can get you really
good discount furniture.

2663
03:33:30,104 --> 03:33:34,137
TALIESIN: Coming back sopping wet and naked I'll
say: And we've got this weird thing that we're not

2664
03:33:34,137 --> 03:33:35,616
entirely sure about.

2665
03:33:35,616 --> 03:33:37,668
LAURA: We found this ball of light. Crystal.

2666
03:33:37,668 --> 03:33:49,262
MATT: "Tell you what. I'll help you under two
conditions. One: should you go back and defeat

2667
03:33:49,262 --> 03:33:57,895
"this wannabe god thing you speak of and all is
well and you're heroes and you have all of this

2668
03:33:57,895 --> 03:34:05,670
"influence and money and everything's grand, we can
discuss maybe creating a doorway for me that

2669
03:34:05,670 --> 03:34:13,469
"allows passage. I'll come visit and see what
strangeness your world seems to have whenever I'd like."

2670
03:34:13,469 --> 03:34:15,570
MARISHA: I don't know if you'd like it.

2671
03:34:15,570 --> 03:34:17,768
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure I can figure out a way."

2672
03:34:17,768 --> 03:34:22,740
LIAM: It's real dicey at the moment.

2673
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:24,768
MATT: "But I'm sure if you succeed, that won't be
a problem, and if you fail, well, then I guess the

2674
03:34:24,768 --> 03:34:25,872
"deal's off, anyway."

2675
03:34:25,872 --> 03:34:27,019
TRAVIS: Very true.

2676
03:34:27,019 --> 03:34:30,216
LAURA: Good point.

2677
03:34:30,216 --> 03:34:34,210
MATT: "Second: I wish to strangle you until
death."

2678
03:34:34,210 --> 03:34:39,264
(laughter)

2679
03:34:39,264 --> 03:34:41,672
SAM: He's into autoerotic asphyxiation?

2680
03:34:41,672 --> 03:34:45,969
TRAVIS: (laughing) Amazing! Oh my god!

2681
03:34:45,969 --> 03:34:50,087
LIAM: Wait, Grog. I'm sorry. Come again?

2682
03:34:50,087 --> 03:35:00,760
MATT: "I wish to put my hands on your throat until
you expire. If you say you're unkillable, well,

2683
03:35:00,760 --> 03:35:02,979
"that's a new experience entirely."

2684
03:35:02,979 --> 03:35:07,062
LIAM: Okay. Okay. Okay.

2685
03:35:07,062 --> 03:35:10,032
LAURA: Will you come back? Have we tested this?

2686
03:35:10,032 --> 03:35:11,724
TRAVIS: Vex, be quiet.

2687
03:35:11,724 --> 03:35:20,432
LIAM: I have one further request on our end. Can
you send us backward in time?

2688
03:35:20,432 --> 03:35:27,178
MATT: "I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, but I
could give the mere passage of an hour."

2689
03:35:27,178 --> 03:35:31,260
SAM: Mere passage of an hour? That's good, yeah.

2690
03:35:31,260 --> 03:35:33,067
MATT: "Day for an hour. I think it's a fair trade,
yes?"

2691
03:35:33,067 --> 03:35:39,151
MARISHA: Can you give us a full day in order to
make sure that he does come back?

2692
03:35:39,151 --> 03:35:44,585
MATT: "Sure. Day for an hour. 24 hours are yours
to do as you like."

2693
03:35:44,585 --> 03:35:48,130
MARISHA: You would come back in 24 hours, right?

2694
03:35:48,130 --> 03:35:54,909
SAM: Can I ask one question first? Will you be
pleasuring yourself during this?

2695
03:35:54,909 --> 03:36:04,713
MATT: He actually laughs at this and goes, "I
think the process will be enjoyable enough."

2696
03:36:04,713 --> 03:36:08,430
SAM: Oh. I respect you so much.

2697
03:36:08,430 --> 03:36:16,978
TALIESIN: Since we're making a deal, I want to
make sure of a few things, because I love making

2698
03:36:16,978 --> 03:36:22,926
deals. First of all, as perhaps a token of
friendship, do you have any idea what this is? I

2699
03:36:22,926 --> 03:36:25,229
am still apologetically naked and wet.

2700
03:36:25,229 --> 03:36:26,652
MATT: "It's a pulse stone."

2701
03:36:26,652 --> 03:36:27,732
ALL: A what?

2702
03:36:27,732 --> 03:36:28,842
MATT: "A pulse stone."

2703
03:36:28,842 --> 03:36:30,099
LAURA and SAM: What is that?

2704
03:36:30,099 --> 03:36:31,989
MATT: "It's meant to distract undead.

2705
03:36:31,989 --> 03:36:34,392
SAM: How do you activate it?

2706
03:36:34,392 --> 03:36:35,844
MATT: "It just does."

2707
03:36:35,844 --> 03:36:46,997
TALIESIN: Thank you. Second question is: when we
do return in an hour, where are we going to

2708
03:36:46,997 --> 03:36:48,184
reappear?

2709
03:36:48,184 --> 03:36:52,956
MATT: "That's up to you. I'm just altering the
time flow. Do you not have a means of returning?

2710
03:36:52,956 --> 03:36:54,631
"You found your way here."

2711
03:36:54,631 --> 03:37:03,205
SAM: The place that we're meaning to return to is
moving. Could you send us to a moving place?

2712
03:37:03,205 --> 03:37:06,454
LAURA: It's Keyleth that's sending us back, and
she can.

2713
03:37:06,454 --> 03:37:11,564
SAM: Can you send us back? We have to send
ourselves back?

2714
03:37:11,564 --> 03:37:16,500
MATT: "<i>I'm</i> concentrating on the passage of time.
That's a large enough endeavor in itself."

2715
03:37:16,500 --> 03:37:22,668
MARISHA: I can get us back to Thar Amphala on the
Material Plane and specify that, but it doesn't

2716
03:37:22,668 --> 03:37:24,918
specify where we're going to land in Thar
Amphala.

2717
03:37:24,918 --> 03:37:26,193
TALIESIN: This is great.

2718
03:37:26,193 --> 03:37:29,293
MARISHA: I got a question, Artagan. Do you know
if--

2719
03:37:29,293 --> 03:37:32,210
LAURA: Is is <i>Ar</i>tagan or Ar<i>ta</i>gan?

2720
03:37:32,210 --> 03:37:35,487
MATT: "Take your preference. I'm just happy to
have friends."

2721
03:37:35,487 --> 03:37:37,265
SAM: Garmelie?

2722
03:37:37,265 --> 03:37:43,614
MATT: "If you must." And he winks, and for a
second you see his form shimmer and you see the

2723
03:37:43,614 --> 03:37:49,544
small satyr image for a moment before it restores
to his grand visage.

2724
03:37:49,544 --> 03:37:53,259
TALIESIN: Another strange question: have you ever
had access to our world before?

2725
03:37:53,259 --> 03:37:55,727
MATT: "A long time ago."

2726
03:37:55,727 --> 03:38:01,816
TALIESIN: Have I read about this cat?

2727
03:38:01,816 --> 03:38:07,051
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Just the
intelligence modifier.

2728
03:38:07,051 --> 03:38:09,792
SAM: I don't remember being in the Feywild at all,
or meeting him.

2729
03:38:09,792 --> 03:38:11,301
LAURA: You don't?

2730
03:38:11,301 --> 03:38:12,337
SAM: Right?

2731
03:38:12,337 --> 03:38:17,468
MATT: Well, it was restored via spell.

2732
03:38:17,468 --> 03:38:20,001
SAM: Oh, that's right. But does that restore
memories?

2733
03:38:20,001 --> 03:38:22,438
MATT: As part of the actual effect, yeah.

2734
03:38:22,438 --> 03:38:24,372
TALIESIN: Nope.

2735
03:38:24,372 --> 03:38:27,014
MATT: You have no idea who he is.

2736
03:38:27,014 --> 03:38:30,336
TALIESIN: Nope, no idea. None, nope. I have no
idea.

2737
03:38:30,336 --> 03:38:32,595
LAURA: You've had access, but you were blocked?

2738
03:38:32,595 --> 03:38:45,571
MATT: "Things rearrange every eon or so, and the
ley lines that guide the paths shift, and I

2739
03:38:45,637 --> 03:38:48,133
"haven't been able to get back since."

2740
03:38:48,133 --> 03:38:49,745
TRAVIS: That seems most unfortunate.

2741
03:38:49,745 --> 03:38:54,448
LAURA: You're not going to become addicted to
strangling people because you've tried it on him.

2742
03:38:54,448 --> 03:38:57,554
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't tried it."

2743
03:38:57,554 --> 03:39:00,215
TALIESIN: How long does he have to be dead in your
hands before you decide that it's worked?

2744
03:39:00,215 --> 03:39:03,163
LIAM: Can I tell if he's lying?

2745
03:39:03,163 --> 03:39:05,369
MATT: Sure, make a deception check. Sorry, an
insight check.

2746
03:39:05,369 --> 03:39:08,882
LIAM: 18.

2747
03:39:08,882 --> 03:39:10,346
MATT: Lying about which one?

2748
03:39:10,346 --> 03:39:11,844
LIAM: Never strangled someone before.

2749
03:39:11,844 --> 03:39:15,039
MATT: You have no idea. He's slippery. He's
mercurial.

2750
03:39:15,039 --> 03:39:18,641
TALIESIN: This is the problem with fey. They don't
tend to lie, they tend to tell just most of the truth.

2751
03:39:18,641 --> 03:39:28,816
LIAM: All right. With a couple of provisions here,
all right? One: you cannot say shit while you're

2752
03:39:28,816 --> 03:39:30,543
doing this.

2753
03:39:30,543 --> 03:39:32,375
LAURA: He's not allowed to talk?

2754
03:39:32,375 --> 03:39:33,669
LIAM: That is correct.

2755
03:39:33,669 --> 03:39:36,274
MATT: "Fair enough. I think it would spoil the
moment, anyway."

2756
03:39:36,274 --> 03:39:43,446
LIAM: Two. And this includes the rest of you lot:
everybody leaves, except for Scanlan and Grog, and

2757
03:39:43,446 --> 03:39:44,868
they stay.

2758
03:39:44,868 --> 03:39:48,048
MARISHA: What?

2759
03:39:48,048 --> 03:39:49,316
TALIESIN: No, I'm all right with that.

2760
03:39:49,316 --> 03:39:50,591
LAURA: I don't want to see it.

2761
03:39:50,591 --> 03:39:51,781
TRAVIS: I think that's a fair request.

2762
03:39:51,781 --> 03:39:52,910
SAM: Can I pleasure myself?

2763
03:39:52,910 --> 03:39:57,047
TALIESIN: I whap Scanlan on the head.

2764
03:39:57,047 --> 03:40:00,715
LIAM: I don't know how to feel about this!

2765
03:40:00,715 --> 03:40:03,129
LAURA: Let him do it. You'll come back, right?

2766
03:40:03,129 --> 03:40:05,911
LIAM: Oh, Vax is okay. That was Liam just now.

2767
03:40:05,911 --> 03:40:07,744
(laughter)

2768
03:40:07,744 --> 03:40:10,950
MARISHA: This is so weird. Okay, wait. Keyleth
pulls Vax aside.

2769
03:40:10,950 --> 03:40:14,691
LAURA: Gross, stop!

2770
03:40:14,691 --> 03:40:16,744
TRAVIS: It's like a dog, you got to pull him off
your calf!

2771
03:40:16,744 --> 03:40:24,765
MARISHA: Are you sure about this? Are you okay
with this?

2772
03:40:24,765 --> 03:40:31,675
LIAM: I'll see you soon.

2773
03:40:31,675 --> 03:40:34,476
MARISHA: We can ask if he wants something else!

2774
03:40:34,476 --> 03:40:38,289
LIAM: Ask him. I don't think he does.

2775
03:40:38,289 --> 03:40:43,438
MARISHA: And you'll be back, yeah?

2776
03:40:43,438 --> 03:40:44,926
LIAM: Probably.

2777
03:40:44,926 --> 03:40:47,747
MARISHA: In 24 hours or so?

2778
03:40:47,747 --> 03:40:50,982
LIAM: I'll be back.

2779
03:40:50,982 --> 03:40:54,984
ASHLEY: Wait, but how do we know for sure?

2780
03:40:54,984 --> 03:40:57,236
SAM: Yeah?

2781
03:40:57,236 --> 03:40:59,203
LIAM: Guys, go. Go on.

2782
03:40:59,203 --> 03:41:00,556
SAM: We have no choice, Pikey.

2783
03:41:00,556 --> 03:41:02,233
TALIESIN: This is what's happening.

2784
03:41:02,233 --> 03:41:06,265
TRAVIS: We got an eye. We'll keep the rule of
law.

2785
03:41:06,265 --> 03:41:08,709
SAM: Do you want to stay, too, Pikey?

2786
03:41:08,709 --> 03:41:10,256
LIAM: Percy?

2787
03:41:10,256 --> 03:41:13,028
ASHLEY: I'm not going to stay if he doesn't want
me to stay.

2788
03:41:13,028 --> 03:41:15,324
LIAM: Take Keyleth out of here, please.

2789
03:41:15,324 --> 03:41:16,441
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

2790
03:41:16,441 --> 03:41:24,502
MARISHA: Wait, no! Wait! I try to give him a kiss
before we leave, before getting dragged out.

2791
03:41:24,502 --> 03:41:35,081
TRAVIS: Vax, I want you to know I've never been
more proud of you than I am right now.

2792
03:41:35,081 --> 03:41:38,099
LIAM: I want you to laugh your fucking ass off,
all right?

2793
03:41:38,099 --> 03:41:42,453
TRAVIS: I might. I'm just saying, you're about to
buy the ticket and take the ride of a literal

2794
03:41:42,453 --> 03:41:43,877
fucking lifetime.

2795
03:41:43,877 --> 03:41:45,219
MARISHA: This is fucking weird.

2796
03:41:45,219 --> 03:41:46,300
TRAVIS: You're not here anymore.

2797
03:41:46,300 --> 03:41:48,395
MARISHA: I'm saying as myself: this is fucking
weird.

2798
03:41:48,395 --> 03:41:51,384
SAM: This is weird. This is like a weird snuff
film.

2799
03:41:51,384 --> 03:41:54,694
MATT: I don't know where this came from?

2800
03:41:54,694 --> 03:41:56,442
TRAVIS: How do you feel? Are you nervous?

2801
03:41:56,442 --> 03:41:58,904
MARISHA: What?

2802
03:41:58,904 --> 03:42:04,048
LIAM: You keep an eye, have him drag me somewhere
safe, and keep an eye on me.

2803
03:42:04,048 --> 03:42:05,230
SAM: Sure.

2804
03:42:05,230 --> 03:42:08,807
TRAVIS: Can I put my hand on his chest? Is the
heart still beating?

2805
03:42:08,807 --> 03:42:10,259
MATT: Yeah, slow.

2806
03:42:10,259 --> 03:42:13,339
TRAVIS: Is it beating any faster? Because he's
nervous.

2807
03:42:13,339 --> 03:42:15,396
MATT: A hint.

2808
03:42:15,396 --> 03:42:18,141
TRAVIS: Still pretty chill.

2809
03:42:18,141 --> 03:42:25,470
TALIESIN: Do you still have advantage on death
saving throws because of that thing that we did a

2810
03:42:25,470 --> 03:42:28,034
while back? Or is that long gone? Never mind.
Carry on.

2811
03:42:28,034 --> 03:42:33,654
TRAVIS: Do you want us to hold anything? Do you
want to wear your clothes?

2812
03:42:33,654 --> 03:42:39,582
LIAM: Let's stop talking, folks. Could you look
after Keyleth, please?

2813
03:42:39,582 --> 03:42:41,040
LAURA: Of course, darling.

2814
03:42:41,040 --> 03:42:42,821
LIAM: See you tomorrow.

2815
03:42:42,821 --> 03:42:44,380
LAURA: See you in a bit.

2816
03:42:44,380 --> 03:42:50,978
ASHLEY: Don't you do anything else! You just
strangle him until he dies, and then you leave him

2817
03:42:50,978 --> 03:42:52,123
alone.

2818
03:42:52,123 --> 03:42:53,206
(laughter)

2819
03:42:53,206 --> 03:42:54,892
MATT: "I wouldn't dream of trying, little one.
Don't worry."

2820
03:42:54,892 --> 03:42:57,756
TALIESIN: Well, this may be the weirdest thing.
This is not the worst thing.

2821
03:42:57,756 --> 03:43:02,184
LAURA: Artagan, this is weird as fuck.

2822
03:43:02,184 --> 03:43:04,945
MATT: "Welcome to my world."

2823
03:43:04,945 --> 03:43:09,890
LAURA: All right. I slowly walk away.

2824
03:43:09,890 --> 03:43:15,172
MATT: Okay. Pike, have you left as well?

2825
03:43:15,172 --> 03:43:23,625
ASHLEY: Yes. I'm going to honor your wishes, Vax.
I'm going to go swim.

2826
03:43:23,625 --> 03:43:25,135
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to swim.

2827
03:43:25,135 --> 03:43:26,944
TALIESIN: Everyone's backing off.

2828
03:43:26,944 --> 03:43:30,535
LAURA: We're swimming naked while my brother is
dying. No big.

2829
03:43:30,535 --> 03:43:31,954
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2830
03:43:31,954 --> 03:43:37,525
LIAM: Hey, Grog. All he gets to is strangle me to
death. That's it.

2831
03:43:37,525 --> 03:43:40,251
TRAVIS: All right. What about after you're dead?

2832
03:43:40,251 --> 03:43:41,305
LIAM: No.

2833
03:43:41,305 --> 03:43:43,199
TRAVIS: No touch at all, no pickle?

2834
03:43:43,199 --> 03:43:48,667
LIAM: Neither Artagan or Scanlan are able to do
anything to me once I'm out.

2835
03:43:48,667 --> 03:43:52,265
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh, okay. Yeah. Right.

2836
03:43:52,265 --> 03:43:56,391
LIAM: And then make sure he doesn't lose me in the
woods or something, okay?

2837
03:43:56,391 --> 03:44:07,189
SAM: You'll be fine. This will be harrowing for
you, but you'll be fine. We'll bring you back.

2838
03:44:07,189 --> 03:44:09,694
LIAM: It's been so much fun until now.

2839
03:44:09,694 --> 03:44:14,010
SAM: This is a sacrifice.

2840
03:44:14,010 --> 03:44:17,839
TRAVIS: Yeah, everything in your life has been
leading up to this point. This is the pinnacle.

2841
03:44:17,839 --> 03:44:19,399
This is great!

2842
03:44:19,399 --> 03:44:21,602
LIAM: Don't speak.

2843
03:44:21,602 --> 03:44:23,269
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2844
03:44:23,269 --> 03:44:30,322
LIAM: I walk up to Artagan. All right, fucknut,
let's do this.

2845
03:44:30,322 --> 03:44:33,875
MATT: "You believe this? You really believe you're
going to come back if you die?"

2846
03:44:33,875 --> 03:44:41,151
LIAM: (clicks tongue)

2847
03:44:41,151 --> 03:44:49,792
MATT: "Fair play. To the immortals." And he takes
your throat and begins to squeeze, his eyes locked

2848
03:44:49,792 --> 03:44:52,037
in, and he keeps watching you.

2849
03:44:52,037 --> 03:44:53,573
LAURA and MARISHA: This is so dark.

2850
03:44:53,573 --> 03:44:58,392
TRAVIS: I step up behind Vax in case he has an
involuntary reaction to reach up to his arms. Just

2851
03:44:58,392 --> 03:44:59,746
to keep his arms down.

2852
03:44:59,746 --> 03:45:01,044
MATT: He locks in.

2853
03:45:01,044 --> 03:45:02,187
LIAM: No fear, remember.

2854
03:45:02,187 --> 03:45:09,476
MATT: Yeah. Without making any other noise,
continues to apply pressure. Eventually, your

2855
03:45:09,476 --> 03:45:11,191
vision begins to go dark.

2856
03:45:11,191 --> 03:45:14,248
LAURA: I'm so glad we can't see this.

2857
03:45:14,248 --> 03:45:16,791
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. Underwater.

2858
03:45:16,791 --> 03:45:18,368
MARISHA: I'd be freaking out.

2859
03:45:18,368 --> 03:45:19,698
SAM: I look away.

2860
03:45:19,698 --> 03:45:21,367
TRAVIS: I don't.

2861
03:45:21,367 --> 03:45:23,390
ASHLEY: I'm peeking out of the pond.

2862
03:45:23,390 --> 03:45:26,934
TALIESIN: I grab her and drag her right back to
the pond.

2863
03:45:26,934 --> 03:45:29,646
MATT: This is so weird.

2864
03:45:29,646 --> 03:45:32,141
TRAVIS: This is your head, man.

2865
03:45:32,141 --> 03:45:33,518
MATT: I know!

2866
03:45:33,518 --> 03:45:36,802
LIAM: You could have asked for a magic wand or a
unicorn, a pony.

2867
03:45:36,802 --> 03:45:44,712
MATT: It was a fascination with something
different and new and you said "cannot die," and

2868
03:45:44,712 --> 03:45:53,389
that immediately piqued his interest. Even the
nicest of fey are weird and have their dark

2869
03:45:53,389 --> 03:45:54,554
sides.

2870
03:45:54,554 --> 03:45:56,768
LIAM: Preach, David Bowie.

2871
03:45:56,768 --> 03:46:04,266
MATT: Yeah. You watch over the next minute or so
as he strangles the life out of Vax.

2872
03:46:04,266 --> 03:46:06,083
LAURA: Oh my god!

2873
03:46:06,083 --> 03:46:07,841
TRAVIS: Are you hungry right now?

2874
03:46:07,841 --> 03:46:15,669
(laughter)

2875
03:46:15,669 --> 03:46:18,739
MATT: This is so fucked up!

2876
03:46:18,739 --> 03:46:20,108
TALIESIN: This is quality internet.

2877
03:46:20,108 --> 03:46:27,760
MATT: I know. Limp in his grasp, Garmelie
eventually pulls one hand back. Still holds him

2878
03:46:27,760 --> 03:46:34,759
now; his feet are dangling, and goes like:
"Satisfying, but not what I thought it would be."

2879
03:46:34,759 --> 03:46:42,445
At which point, you watch as the body and flesh of
Vax begins to burn to ashes out of the armor, and

2880
03:46:42,445 --> 03:46:45,122
the armor falls to the ground in pieces.

2881
03:46:45,122 --> 03:46:46,982
TRAVIS: Oh god. Okay.

2882
03:46:46,982 --> 03:46:52,861
MARISHA: Well, last time he got disintegrated, so
we didn't really see him evaporate. But that makes

2883
03:46:52,861 --> 03:46:54,246
sense.

2884
03:46:54,246 --> 03:47:00,104
TRAVIS: I'm going to look at Scanlan. Were you
expecting this at all?

2885
03:47:00,104 --> 03:47:02,570
SAM: No, not at all. What the fuck is this?

2886
03:47:02,570 --> 03:47:04,538
TRAVIS: I'm going to grab the armor, if you don't
mind.

2887
03:47:04,538 --> 03:47:06,244
MATT: "Of course. It's yours."

2888
03:47:06,244 --> 03:47:07,545
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

2889
03:47:07,545 --> 03:47:09,202
SAM: I'll scoop up everything.

2890
03:47:09,202 --> 03:47:14,619
TRAVIS: Let's go away from the group, into the
trees. Hopefully, that won't kill us. And we lay

2891
03:47:14,619 --> 03:47:15,897
it down.

2892
03:47:15,897 --> 03:47:17,811
SAM: I'll make a little circle of rocks.

2893
03:47:17,811 --> 03:47:21,186
MARISHA: Oh, stop it! I kick the rocks out of
formation.

2894
03:47:21,186 --> 03:47:22,518
TRAVIS: You're not there!

2895
03:47:22,518 --> 03:47:24,793
MARISHA: Oh, I thought he dragged it outside.

2896
03:47:24,793 --> 03:47:26,890
TALIESIN: They're in the woods. We're in the
pond.

2897
03:47:26,890 --> 03:47:32,668
TRAVIS: I wanted to shave half of his head because
he shaved my beard that one time, but there's

2898
03:47:32,668 --> 03:47:34,565
really nothing left of him right now.

2899
03:47:34,565 --> 03:47:37,944
SAM: I don't think that that would be a good time
to do this.

2900
03:47:37,944 --> 03:47:43,627
MATT: As you guys are swimming, the water breaks
and you see the still dry hair as it emerges from

2901
03:47:43,627 --> 03:47:51,540
the pool of Garmelie, though he is now undressed
in the water, as well. "Ah! So that's one deal

2902
03:47:51,540 --> 03:47:55,791
"done. Where do you wish to rest?"

2903
03:47:55,791 --> 03:47:59,663
LAURA: Oh. Is it safe to rest?

2904
03:47:59,663 --> 03:48:01,337
MATT: "While I'm here, yes."

2905
03:48:01,337 --> 03:48:14,430
LAURA: Okay. (whimpers) Should we wait? We need to
wait 24 hours to bring him back. It takes 24 hours?

2906
03:48:14,430 --> 03:48:16,476
LIAM: Nobody knows that.

2907
03:48:16,476 --> 03:48:18,133
SAM: I don't know that.

2908
03:48:18,133 --> 03:48:24,129
MARISHA: Somewhere in that time? How long did it
take last time? It wasn't a full 24 hours, but it

2909
03:48:24,129 --> 03:48:25,352
was the next day.

2910
03:48:25,352 --> 03:48:26,280
LAURA: It was that night.

2911
03:48:26,280 --> 03:48:29,529
MARISHA: I don't want to leave.

2912
03:48:29,529 --> 03:48:33,984
TALIESIN: Might be a dawn thing. We moved and he
appeared.

2913
03:48:33,984 --> 03:48:36,752
TRAVIS: That's the thing about dawn. It takes a
while out here, doesn't it?

2914
03:48:36,752 --> 03:48:39,848
TALIESIN: Dawn doesn't really exist out here. It's
just a rest.

2915
03:48:39,848 --> 03:48:42,348
LIAM: It's like a Vegas casino: it's always the
same twilight.

2916
03:48:42,348 --> 03:48:46,201
LAURA: All right, well. Okay.

2917
03:48:46,201 --> 03:48:49,588
TALIESIN: Is there somewhere else that we could go
to recuperate?

2918
03:48:49,588 --> 03:48:52,752
TRAVIS: Wasn't expecting the ashes part.

2919
03:48:52,752 --> 03:48:55,212
LAURA: Yeah, this is crazy.

2920
03:48:55,212 --> 03:49:01,901
TRAVIS: I expected the crash test dummy. Weekend
at Bernie's. I had a whole fucking theme park

2921
03:49:01,901 --> 03:49:03,034
lined up.

2922
03:49:03,034 --> 03:49:06,704
(laughter)

2923
03:49:06,704 --> 03:49:08,342
ASHLEY: Is it bad if we set up camp right here?

2924
03:49:08,342 --> 03:49:10,682
LAURA: Yeah, let's set up camp here. We know this
area.

2925
03:49:10,682 --> 03:49:14,878
MATT: "Of course! Please." And he points over and
you look back to where you were on the edge of the

2926
03:49:14,878 --> 03:49:18,966
pool, and you can see there's a bunch of stumps
that weren't there before that seem to have

2927
03:49:18,966 --> 03:49:22,932
elongated into chairs and couches and bits of
furniture.

2928
03:49:22,932 --> 03:49:25,737
LAURA: Oh shit. Nice.

2929
03:49:25,737 --> 03:49:27,003
MATT: "Thank you."

2930
03:49:27,003 --> 03:49:29,468
LAURA: (sighs)

2931
03:49:29,468 --> 03:49:31,638
SAM: Are we going to rest here?

2932
03:49:31,638 --> 03:49:39,596
LAURA: Yeah, but we need to do a feast before we
go back. Well, the thing is, it uses a spell, so

2933
03:49:39,596 --> 03:49:42,475
it has to be within the 24 hours.

2934
03:49:42,475 --> 03:49:45,508
TALIESIN: That will be the last thing we do
before we go to sleep.

2935
03:49:45,508 --> 03:49:50,432
LAURA: Okay, but I want Vax to have the feast, as
well, so--

2936
03:49:50,432 --> 03:49:53,392
MARISHA: Can we save him leftovers?

2937
03:49:53,392 --> 03:49:56,485
SAM: Do we have to wait a whole day before he
comes back?

2938
03:49:56,485 --> 03:49:57,532
TRAVIS: We don't know.

2939
03:49:57,532 --> 03:50:01,513
LAURA: We don't know how long it takes. We can try
to wait and see how long it takes and then rest?

2940
03:50:01,513 --> 03:50:02,489
MARISHA: Maybe.

2941
03:50:02,489 --> 03:50:04,089
TALIESIN: We have a little time.

2942
03:50:04,089 --> 03:50:06,939
LAURA: Let's give it some time.

2943
03:50:06,939 --> 03:50:09,887
MARISHA: Besides, Garmelie gave us his word.

2944
03:50:09,887 --> 03:50:11,604
TALIESIN: One day.

2945
03:50:11,604 --> 03:50:13,147
MATT: "One day."

2946
03:50:13,147 --> 03:50:19,018
MARISHA: So we might as well wait a few hours, at
least, right?

2947
03:50:19,018 --> 03:50:20,961
SAM: Anything else we can accomplish here?

2948
03:50:20,961 --> 03:50:22,618
MATT: "We can play."

2949
03:50:22,618 --> 03:50:25,100
LAURA: This feels weird to play.

2950
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:29,237
MATT: "Oh, do about yourselves. You seem disturbed
by my presence."

2951
03:50:29,237 --> 03:50:30,490
TRAVIS: I do have a question.

2952
03:50:30,490 --> 03:50:31,575
MATT: "Yes?"

2953
03:50:31,575 --> 03:50:34,470
TRAVIS: Are you familiar with the werewolves that
roam these lands?

2954
03:50:34,470 --> 03:50:40,502
MATT: "I am familiar with the werewolves that now
roam these lands, yes."

2955
03:50:40,502 --> 03:50:43,135
TRAVIS: Right. Are they around this part?

2956
03:50:43,135 --> 03:50:45,325
MATT: "No, not at the moment."

2957
03:50:45,325 --> 03:50:47,641
LAURA: You can sense them?

2958
03:50:47,641 --> 03:50:54,610
MATT: "I have an idea where they might be. I know
when they're not near me."

2959
03:50:54,610 --> 03:50:58,498
TRAVIS: That's all. I'm just saying. Just
curious.

2960
03:50:58,498 --> 03:51:04,487
LAURA: Hey, Artagan. Does killing a wannabe god
sound fun to you?

2961
03:51:04,487 --> 03:51:07,479
MATT: "Sounds interesting."

2962
03:51:07,479 --> 03:51:11,681
LAURA: It would be much more fulfilling than
strangling a person that didn't fight back, right?

2963
03:51:11,681 --> 03:51:13,932
MATT: "I don't know."

2964
03:51:13,932 --> 03:51:15,744
LAURA: Would you want to come through with us?

2965
03:51:15,744 --> 03:51:20,987
MARISHA: Give a little tour of our land that you
so desperately want access to.

2966
03:51:20,987 --> 03:51:26,289
TALIESIN: There's currently a giant city walking
its way towards another giant city.

2967
03:51:26,289 --> 03:51:29,046
TRAVIS: Some sweet action with some stuff maybe
you haven't seen before.

2968
03:51:29,046 --> 03:51:32,159
TALIESIN: A skeletonized dragon. A gold dragon.

2969
03:51:32,159 --> 03:51:36,250
MARISHA: Undead dwarves.

2970
03:51:36,250 --> 03:51:38,352
TALIESIN: Cannibal undead dwarves.

2971
03:51:38,352 --> 03:51:40,969
TRAVIS: One-eyed prick named Vecna.

2972
03:51:40,969 --> 03:51:46,539
MATT: "I mean, that'd be great but I <i>can't</i>."

2973
03:51:46,539 --> 03:51:50,146
LAURA: Oh. You have to have a specific doorway.

2974
03:51:50,146 --> 03:51:52,269
MATT: "Once you have the door, I'd be happy to
join you."

2975
03:51:52,269 --> 03:51:55,115
LAURA: Okay. And that's a time-consuming sort of
thing?

2976
03:51:55,115 --> 03:51:57,145
MATT: "Depends how long you can build a
doorway, I suppose."

2977
03:51:57,145 --> 03:52:00,816
MARISHA: Sounds like a time-consuming thing.

2978
03:52:00,816 --> 03:52:03,414
MATT: "Most likely. No offense to any of you if
you're carpenters."

2979
03:52:03,414 --> 03:52:05,935
TALIESIN: No, we've had an enormous amount of
trouble with doors in our time.

2980
03:52:05,935 --> 03:52:08,350
(laughter)

2981
03:52:08,350 --> 03:52:09,995
TALIESIN: Very tricky.

2982
03:52:09,995 --> 03:52:17,192
MATT: "Well, take your time! Rest. Food is
prepared. You can go amongst yourselves. I'll be

2983
03:52:17,192 --> 03:52:20,534
"here, splashing away." And he splashes into the
water.

2984
03:52:20,534 --> 03:52:23,715
TRAVIS: That guy knows how to relax.

2985
03:52:23,715 --> 03:52:26,924
MARISHA: Is that how he lives all the time?

2986
03:52:26,924 --> 03:52:33,467
TRAVIS: Think so. Yeah, probably nude.
Probably put clothes on to be nice around us.

2987
03:52:33,467 --> 03:52:35,222
LAURA: Sylas is alive.

2988
03:52:35,222 --> 03:52:36,453
TRAVIS: What did you say?

2989
03:52:36,453 --> 03:52:38,627
SAM: Sylas. She said Sylas is alive.

2990
03:52:38,627 --> 03:52:39,903
LAURA: Sylas is back.

2991
03:52:39,903 --> 03:52:41,035
TRAVIS: Briarwood?

2992
03:52:41,035 --> 03:52:44,801
LAURA: Yeah, didn't you see him right before we
left? He was right in front of Delilah.

2993
03:52:44,801 --> 03:52:46,696
TALIESIN: I'm watching to see if anyone eats the
food.

2994
03:52:46,696 --> 03:52:49,346
TRAVIS: No. I was eating all the food in the
mansion.

2995
03:52:49,346 --> 03:52:52,366
MATT: Plenty of food on these small stools here
and there.

2996
03:52:52,366 --> 03:52:53,708
MARISHA: Remember what?

2997
03:52:53,708 --> 03:52:56,838
SAM: I don't know what I was going to say.

2998
03:52:56,838 --> 03:53:01,502
TRAVIS: Didn't you evaporate him with a Sunbeam or
something? And then we like killed him in a

2999
03:53:01,502 --> 03:53:02,492
coffin?

3000
03:53:02,492 --> 03:53:03,589
LAURA: We killed him.

3001
03:53:03,589 --> 03:53:04,997
MARISHA: Sylas? Yeah.

3002
03:53:04,997 --> 03:53:10,747
LAURA: Wasn't it Pike who killed Sylas or was it
you? It was you. Oh, that's right, and you said

3003
03:53:10,747 --> 03:53:11,935
"eat a bag of dicks."

3004
03:53:11,935 --> 03:53:14,941
MARISHA: That was the bag of holy dicks moment.
Bag of holy dicks.

3005
03:53:14,941 --> 03:53:16,824
TALIESIN: It's been a long time.

3006
03:53:16,824 --> 03:53:21,255
MARISHA: Yeah, I shot the beam off of Pike's
shield. It was actually pretty dope.

3007
03:53:21,255 --> 03:53:22,835
LAURA: Great, so he's back.

3008
03:53:22,835 --> 03:53:33,681
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over by Vax's armor and
stuff. Just sit there and flop it around.

3009
03:53:33,681 --> 03:53:35,066
MATT: Okay.

3010
03:53:35,066 --> 03:53:37,256
SAM: Armor fluffer?

3011
03:53:37,256 --> 03:53:42,125
MATT: Is there anything you guys wish to
accomplish in this time, or do you want to take

3012
03:53:42,125 --> 03:53:44,316
time to wait to see if your friend returns?

3013
03:53:44,316 --> 03:53:47,534
LAURA: What can we accomplish? What can we do?
There's got to be something we can do.

3014
03:53:47,534 --> 03:53:48,912
SAM: I need to accomplish something.

3015
03:53:48,912 --> 03:53:50,048
LAURA: What do you need to do?

3016
03:53:50,048 --> 03:53:59,913
SAM: I don't know. I have a spell, and I can use
it before we rest, but I don't know what to use it on.

3017
03:53:59,913 --> 03:54:01,139
LAURA: What is it?

3018
03:54:01,139 --> 03:54:12,881
SAM: Well, I can do a few different things before
we sleep. We can go out into the woods and find an

3019
03:54:12,881 --> 03:54:23,039
animal, a big animal. I could turn it into
something, like a flying thing that we could give

3020
03:54:23,039 --> 03:54:27,730
to Grog so he could fly. Fly with that sword.

3021
03:54:27,730 --> 03:54:30,719
LAURA: Like a mount sort of situation?

3022
03:54:30,719 --> 03:54:32,202
SAM: Like a wyvern.

3023
03:54:32,202 --> 03:54:37,304
LAURA: You can turn an animal into a wyvern?

3024
03:54:37,304 --> 03:54:38,438
SAM: Sure.

3025
03:54:38,438 --> 03:54:39,735
LAURA: Any animal?

3026
03:54:39,735 --> 03:54:41,148
SAM: A big animal.

3027
03:54:41,148 --> 03:54:43,189
LAURA: Bigger than Trinket?

3028
03:54:43,189 --> 03:54:47,189
SAM: I would love to turn Trinket into a wyvern.

3029
03:54:47,189 --> 03:54:50,625
(laughter)

3030
03:54:50,625 --> 03:54:51,959
LAURA: Is it permanent?

3031
03:54:51,959 --> 03:54:52,815
SAM: Yes.

3032
03:54:52,815 --> 03:54:54,246
LAURA: Oh, never mind, then.

3033
03:54:54,246 --> 03:54:55,565
TRAVIS: Is it a big spell for you?

3034
03:54:55,565 --> 03:54:56,732
SAM: Yeah.

3035
03:54:56,732 --> 03:55:02,248
LAURA: Trinket? Would you want to be turned into a
wyvern?

3036
03:55:02,248 --> 03:55:03,501
SAM: Forever.

3037
03:55:03,501 --> 03:55:05,761
MATT: (questioning bear noise)

3038
03:55:05,761 --> 03:55:11,341
LAURA: Hold on, let me see if I've got Speak With
Animals. I don't think I have it. It's 1st-level,

3039
03:55:11,341 --> 03:55:14,137
I can still do it! Trinket?

3040
03:55:14,137 --> 03:55:15,484
MATT: "Yes?"

3041
03:55:15,484 --> 03:55:21,329
LAURA: Would you want to be turned into a wyvern
forever? (whispering) Say no.

3042
03:55:21,329 --> 03:55:22,912
MATT: "What's a wyvern?"

3043
03:55:22,912 --> 03:55:30,585
LAURA: It's like a lizard that's really big that's
got wings. Not so much? Okay. Just checking. I

3044
03:55:30,585 --> 03:55:34,046
just wanted to make sure. It's your choice,
darling.

3045
03:55:34,046 --> 03:55:35,203
SAM: Did he say yes?

3046
03:55:35,203 --> 03:55:36,536
LAURA: No, he said no.

3047
03:55:36,536 --> 03:55:38,539
SAM: I knew that. I can speak with animals, too.

3048
03:55:38,539 --> 03:55:42,310
(laughter)

3049
03:55:42,310 --> 03:55:44,459
LAURA: You haven't been saying shitty things to my
bear, have you?

3050
03:55:44,459 --> 03:55:45,840
SAM: All year.

3051
03:55:45,840 --> 03:55:48,097
(laughter)

3052
03:55:48,097 --> 03:55:50,420
LAURA: Trinket, don't ever listen to him. He's
horrible.

3053
03:55:50,420 --> 03:55:52,454
MATT: (spits)

3054
03:55:52,454 --> 03:55:54,055
(laughter)

3055
03:55:54,055 --> 03:55:56,295
SAM: Or--

3056
03:55:56,295 --> 03:55:57,392
TRAVIS: Or?

3057
03:55:57,392 --> 03:55:59,668
SAM: Or I could do other things.

3058
03:55:59,668 --> 03:56:00,970
LAURA: Like what?!

3059
03:56:00,970 --> 03:56:08,662
SAM: I could do other things. I could make another
compatriot for us to have in battle.

3060
03:56:08,662 --> 03:56:11,817
LAURA: Like another Artagan?

3061
03:56:11,817 --> 03:56:16,257
SAM: Like another Scanlan. Or another Pike.

3062
03:56:16,257 --> 03:56:19,589
LAURA: Would they be fully capable to cast all
your spells?

3063
03:56:19,589 --> 03:56:20,702
SAM: Yes.

3064
03:56:20,702 --> 03:56:22,287
LAURA: Oh shit!

3065
03:56:22,287 --> 03:56:24,189
LIAM: Spells.

3066
03:56:24,189 --> 03:56:28,893
SAM: Or I could do other things.

3067
03:56:28,893 --> 03:56:32,176
TRAVIS: Actually, that last one is pretty dope.

3068
03:56:32,176 --> 03:56:33,897
LIAM: Yeah, two Scanlans.

3069
03:56:33,897 --> 03:56:38,463
TRAVIS: Get all your turns, all your everything?
Two times whoever you make?

3070
03:56:38,463 --> 03:56:39,980
SAM: I don't know. Never done this before.

3071
03:56:39,980 --> 03:56:41,423
LAURA: Oh my god, what kind of spell is this?

3072
03:56:41,423 --> 03:56:44,616
SAM: It's a crazy spell.

3073
03:56:44,616 --> 03:56:46,967
TRAVIS: Do that one. Fuck the flying thing.

3074
03:56:46,967 --> 03:56:48,787
SAM: But if you could fly--

3075
03:56:48,787 --> 03:56:51,632
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know he hovers and flies, but.

3076
03:56:51,632 --> 03:56:53,630
SAM: Yeah. You could bring that sword to his
neck.

3077
03:56:53,630 --> 03:56:55,463
LIAM: Could you give Grog wings?

3078
03:56:55,463 --> 03:57:05,129
SAM: It's a real thing. Magic would not stop it
from flying. It would be a <i>real</i> thing.

3079
03:57:05,129 --> 03:57:07,807
LAURA: A real thing that could be killed right out
from under him, though.

3080
03:57:07,807 --> 03:57:10,754
SAM: Sure, but it couldn't be dispelled with
magic.

3081
03:57:10,754 --> 03:57:12,851
TALIESIN: Could be disintegrated, though.

3082
03:57:12,851 --> 03:57:14,947
LAURA: And then Grog would fall.

3083
03:57:14,947 --> 03:57:16,876
LIAM: Right.

3084
03:57:16,876 --> 03:57:19,900
TRAVIS: Can you cast Fly on somebody?

3085
03:57:19,900 --> 03:57:24,867
SAM: No. I can turn you into an eagle.

3086
03:57:24,867 --> 03:57:27,451
LAURA: Not with that sword.

3087
03:57:27,451 --> 03:57:37,340
TRAVIS: No. The option of having a second caster
like you is way bigger than making me fly.

3088
03:57:37,340 --> 03:57:39,778
SAM: Another Scanlan who could easily be
destroyed.

3089
03:57:39,778 --> 03:57:42,663
LAURA: Well, but so could one of us.

3090
03:57:42,663 --> 03:57:45,899
SAM: Well, it'll be a magic thing that could be
dispelled.

3091
03:57:45,899 --> 03:57:49,093
TRAVIS: If they know it's magic.

3092
03:57:49,093 --> 03:57:53,298
MARISHA: But you just said the other thing
couldn't be destroyed.

3093
03:57:53,298 --> 03:57:57,508
SAM: That thing couldn't. That would be a
different spell altogether.

3094
03:57:57,508 --> 03:58:04,291
TRAVIS: I still like that idea better.

3095
03:58:04,291 --> 03:58:07,367
SAM: There's other things, too.

3096
03:58:07,367 --> 03:58:08,710
LAURA: Like what?!

3097
03:58:08,710 --> 03:58:10,624
(laughter)

3098
03:58:10,624 --> 03:58:21,537
SAM: I could cast a spell on one of us that if you
died, it would activate, and it would heal you.

3099
03:58:21,537 --> 03:58:23,257
LAURA: Completely?

3100
03:58:23,257 --> 03:58:24,282
SAM: No.

3101
03:58:24,282 --> 03:58:27,899
LAURA: Oh, Death Ward. Pike can cast that.

3102
03:58:27,899 --> 03:58:35,211
MARISHA: Whatever you do, I can get me plus eight
other people through with Plane Shift. Eight

3103
03:58:35,211 --> 03:58:36,838
willing creatures.

3104
03:58:36,838 --> 03:58:40,190
SAM: But my Death Ward would last for ten days.

3105
03:58:40,190 --> 03:58:48,342
TALIESIN: There are not going to be ten days. We
don't need a ten-day Death Ward. We need a one-day

3106
03:58:48,342 --> 03:58:49,553
Death Ward.

3107
03:58:49,553 --> 03:58:53,621
LAURA: Plus, we all have our blessings-- not all
of us. We have some blessings from gods that will

3108
03:58:53,621 --> 03:58:57,174
activate, hopefully, right before.

3109
03:58:57,174 --> 03:58:59,893
MARISHA: Can you do a one-day blessing on ten of
us?

3110
03:58:59,893 --> 03:59:01,992
TRAVIS: Can you cast Haste?

3111
03:59:01,992 --> 03:59:06,865
SAM: No. I mean, I could, but it seems like a
shitty use--

3112
03:59:06,865 --> 03:59:13,446
TRAVIS: If there's two of you and you could cast
Haste on me, I'd take that over the flying

3113
03:59:13,446 --> 03:59:14,703
creature.

3114
03:59:14,703 --> 03:59:16,064
SAM: If there's two of me.

3115
03:59:16,064 --> 03:59:18,601
TALIESIN: Well, you with Haste would be
horrifying.

3116
03:59:18,601 --> 03:59:25,216
TRAVIS: It's nasty. It doesn't get me off the
ground, but at close speed. I'd have a hundred

3117
03:59:25,216 --> 03:59:27,342
feet of movement.

3118
03:59:27,342 --> 03:59:29,420
LAURA: And another attack.

3119
03:59:29,420 --> 03:59:32,298
TRAVIS: Yeah. Plus an action surge.

3120
03:59:32,298 --> 03:59:34,160
SAM: I can't cast Haste. I don't know it.

3121
03:59:34,160 --> 03:59:37,006
LAURA: You can't? Hey, Pike, do you know Haste?

3122
03:59:37,006 --> 03:59:40,627
ASHLEY: No. It's not a cleric spell.

3123
03:59:40,627 --> 03:59:43,862
SAM: Who does?

3124
03:59:43,862 --> 03:59:47,093
LIAM, LAURA and TALIESIN: None of us have it.

3125
03:59:47,093 --> 03:59:49,805
TALIESIN: Just the boots.

3126
03:59:49,805 --> 03:59:51,555
LAURA: Okay.

3127
03:59:51,555 --> 04:00:02,771
TRAVIS: You've got a decision to make. We've got
sleep to get.

3128
04:00:02,771 --> 04:00:07,479
MATT: You've got time to think. We'll say for the
purposes of the time you have been waiting. Hours

3129
04:00:07,479 --> 04:00:11,792
pass. You're not sure how much time has passed.
You've plotted, you've thought, you've napped,

3130
04:00:11,792 --> 04:00:17,611
you've contemplated this weird bubble of time that
now exists, this brief respite, but where it leads

3131
04:00:17,611 --> 04:00:26,151
you is unique and strange. As you all begin to
question and wonder, is he going to come back?

3132
04:00:26,151 --> 04:00:31,357
Does he come back here? Last time you saw him, he
arrived with you in the Feywild.

3133
04:00:31,357 --> 04:00:37,837
TRAVIS: Oh, and he died in the Material Plane?
(gulps) Oh shit.

3134
04:00:37,837 --> 04:00:50,479
MATT: But you carried the ashes with you then. As
soon as these doubts begin to emerge, you turn at

3135
04:00:50,479 --> 04:00:55,505
the sound of a footfall and around the corner,
hand on the side of a tree, you see for the second

3136
04:00:55,505 --> 04:00:59,254
time in this grove a nude Vax'ildan.

3137
04:00:59,254 --> 04:01:00,627
SAM: Oh!

3138
04:01:00,627 --> 04:01:02,541
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (sighs of relief)

3139
04:01:02,541 --> 04:01:04,079
TRAVIS: (cheers)

3140
04:01:04,079 --> 04:01:06,508
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's game.

3141
04:01:06,508 --> 04:01:09,181
TRAVIS: For the second time: butt-naked ending!

3142
04:01:09,181 --> 04:01:15,995
MATT: Because it is past 11. Man, a lot of weird
shit happened that game!

3143
04:01:15,995 --> 04:01:19,094
TRAVIS: Fuck!

3144
04:01:19,094 --> 04:01:21,444
MARISHA: I have to go home with you.

3145
04:01:21,444 --> 04:01:26,303
MATT: I'm sorry! It made sense for him in the
moment!

3146
04:01:26,303 --> 04:01:27,958
TRAVIS: No, that was--

3147
04:01:27,958 --> 04:01:29,105
LAURA: Awesome.

3148
04:01:29,105 --> 04:01:31,157
MATT: It was a weird, dark shade of the fey you
don't see.

3149
04:01:31,157 --> 04:01:33,589
TRAVIS: It was the best thing I could have ever
hoped you said.

3150
04:01:33,589 --> 04:01:35,652
LIAM: I didn't expect it.

3151
04:01:35,652 --> 04:01:40,167
LAURA: It certainly made us opening a doorway so
he can get into the real world a little bit more

3152
04:01:40,167 --> 04:01:41,333
questionable.

3153
04:01:41,333 --> 04:01:42,321
MARISHA: Yeah.

3154
04:01:42,321 --> 04:01:44,454
MATT: But that's the fun of it. How much can you
trust any fey?

3155
04:01:44,454 --> 04:01:46,808
TALIESIN: No. They're monstrous. I'm so excited.

3156
04:01:46,808 --> 04:01:50,931
MATT: Man, I'm sorry the etherealness went
bottoms-up.

3157
04:01:50,931 --> 04:01:52,676
LIAM: Oh my god.

3158
04:01:52,676 --> 04:01:54,002
TALIESIN: No, it was great.

3159
04:01:54,002 --> 04:01:56,587
LAURA: We still did it! We still got it!

3160
04:01:56,587 --> 04:02:01,869
LIAM: We came close to fucking up that ring
proximity thing seven times, and then finally we

3161
04:02:01,869 --> 04:02:03,002
did fuck it up.

3162
04:02:03,002 --> 04:02:06,401
MATT: It was probably an eventuality. (laughs)

3163
04:02:06,401 --> 04:02:09,003
SAM: Can the episode title be "Dicks and Dicks"?

3164
04:02:09,003 --> 04:02:11,410
(laughter)

3165
04:02:11,410 --> 04:02:12,887
MATT: I'll see what I can do.

3166
04:02:12,887 --> 04:02:15,493
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Dungeons and Dicks.

3167
04:02:15,493 --> 04:02:20,590
MATT: But anyway, thank you guys. We're going to
get some rest. Thank you guys for going with us

3168
04:02:20,590 --> 04:02:22,230
through this very interesting episode.

3169
04:02:22,230 --> 04:02:24,500
LAURA: Ashley, your drawing was amazing.

3170
04:02:24,500 --> 04:02:25,615
TRAVIS: Ashley!

3171
04:02:25,615 --> 04:02:27,389
LIAM: Post that shit!

3172
04:02:27,389 --> 04:02:34,656
MATT: Yeah. We'll return next week, and I think
we'll have a special guest next week.

3173
04:02:34,656 --> 04:02:36,825
SAM: What? Is that true?

3174
04:02:36,825 --> 04:02:37,962
MATT: Yeah.

3175
04:02:37,962 --> 04:02:38,976
TRAVIS: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest.

3176
04:02:38,976 --> 04:02:41,264
ALL: Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest.

3177
04:02:41,264 --> 04:02:47,249
SAM: Show them support, show them love, guys. They
really appreciate it. Tweet at them, follow them

3178
04:02:47,249 --> 04:02:53,276
on Facebook, add them as a LinkedIn friend. Sext
them.

3179
04:02:53,276 --> 04:02:55,067
LIAM: Check their Myspace.

3180
04:02:55,067 --> 04:02:58,059
MARISHA: Sext them? Yeah, send them a bunch of
porn links.

3181
04:02:58,059 --> 04:03:00,366
LAURA: No, don't do that. Please don't do that.

3182
04:03:00,366 --> 04:03:02,472
MARISHA: That was a joke!

3183
04:03:02,472 --> 04:03:06,383
(laughter)

3184
04:03:06,383 --> 04:03:13,971
MATT: Anyway, rest well, see you guys in a week,
and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

3185
04:03:13,971 --> 04:10:09,003
