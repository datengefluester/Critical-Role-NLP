1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:03,277
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:06,363
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons.

3
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,706
TRAVIS: That's what we do!

4
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:13,613
MATT: Yep! So, welcome. We had a brief break last
week as Liam brought us through his delightfully

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,694
dark and twisted mind. Thank you again, Liam, for
running that.

6
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:17,725
LAURA: Creepy!

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:19,388
LIAM: I went to Catholic school!

8
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:20,660
MATT: It was awesome.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,883
MARISHA: Why am I not surprised?

10
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:32,137
MATT: So, anyway, glad you could join us. Before
we jump into tonight's game, we have some quick

11
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:37,184
announcements to make. First and foremost, you
want to talk about some new merch stuff that just

12
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:39,323
got in there? What the hell you've got right
there?

13
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,647
MARISHA: What's that?

14
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:43,026
ASHLEY: What are these?

15
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:49,637
LAURA: What are these? These shirts are in the
store right now! And the color, and they're so

16
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:52,348
soft, I'll be petting you guys throughout the
whole night.

17
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:55,218
LIAM: They're soft like the hoodie. They're like a
thin version of the soft hoodie.

18
00:00:55,218 --> 00:01:05,956
LAURA: If you have the Gilmore shirt, it feels
like the Gilmore shirt. Also, the Critical Role

19
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:11,343
dice are coming back in stock very soon, but they
are on preorder right now in the store. You can go

20
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:18,607
in and get on that. We also have the CR enamel pin
back in stock, so you can check that shit out in

21
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,411
the store right now. We'll wait.

22
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:28,487
MATT: Awesome. Let's see. There's a new Signal
Boost coming out this week with kind of a cool

23
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,906
person who hosted that. Who's that?

24
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,928
TRAVIS: DM O'Drien!

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,447
LIAM: I am not cool, so you are not talking about
me.

26
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:42,305
MARISHA: It's actually going to play during the
break.

27
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:43,767
LIAM: Oh yeah?

28
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:44,807
MARISHA: Yeah!

29
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:48,526
LIAM: So you can hear about all my artsy-fartsy
theatrical sad hangups from the past?

30
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,547
Oh joy, guys!

31
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:54,260
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah! You'll like it! So stick
around!

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:04,871
MATT: Look forward to that. And also, a reminder
that MomoCon's coming up, end of next month, where

33
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:11,630
Taliesin, Marisha and I will be guests and, as of
recently, our good friend Brian Wayne Foster will

34
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,567
also be joining us for a Talks Machina live panel
at the event, which will be fun.

35
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,008
MATT: MomoCon!

36
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,738
LIAM: Yeah, MomoCon is just fun to say. MomoCon.

37
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:22,726
LAURA: We're all going to say it.

38
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:28,499
MATT: Yeah. So we'll be there, it'll be fun. It's
May 25th to the 28th, in Atlanta, Georgia. Look

39
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,201
forward to seeing you guys there.

40
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:33,008
LIAM: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

41
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:37,346
LAURA: Oh my, what? How? Why?

42
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:41,503
(laughter)

43
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:44,140
SAM: It's the start of a new year.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,709
TRAVIS: Why doesn't it wrap around to the back?

45
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,781
SAM: I tried to get the eyes on my nipples.

46
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:54,486
TRAVIS: Pull it down a little bit. Just give it a
little tug. There it is.

47
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:59,790
LAURA: I've never realized how large-- Wow, it's
bulging. Those are some bulging eye sausages if

48
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,496
I've ever seen them.

49
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:04,656
MATT: What's great is when you're not stretching
it, it looks like that dumb FaceApp thing now

50
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,837
where you can see your older version of yourself.

51
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:12,655
LAURA: Have you noticed, the guys turn into girls
so much better than the girls turn into guys? I

52
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,239
mean, we look so terrible turning into--

53
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,891
MATT: I've seen some girl photos that turned out
pretty good. Maybe it's just you guys.

54
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,781
LAURA: You have to have your hair pulled back.

55
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:25,931
MATT: It might just be the three of you, I'm
sorry. Although who did Ashley

56
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,492
end up looking like?

57
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,647
MARISHA: Haley Joel Osment.

58
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,485
MATT: Yeah, that worked out pretty well.

59
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,818
ASHLEY: Actually, a lot of people tell me that I
look like him anyway.

60
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,733
LAURA: Really?

61
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,328
ASHLEY: Him or-- I get--

62
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:37,539
TRAVIS: Brad Pitt?

63
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,286
LAURA: Yeah, definitely Brad Pitt.

64
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,974
ASHLEY: From the '80s band, it's a guy.

65
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,907
TRAVIS: Keep going.

66
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,354
ASHLEY: Justin George?

67
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,618
LIAM: Narrowed it down. Hum a melody.

68
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,843
ASHLEY: I can't think of a song. I'll think of
it.

69
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,084
LIAM: This is the whole episode.

70
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:59,289
LAURA: And she'll just yell it out during the
break. Travis makes a really ugly woman, though. I

71
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,450
turned one of your pictures into a girl. I never
should have done that.

72
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,342
MATT: I don't agree with that. I've seen Nip
Tuck.

73
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,206
TRAVIS: Thank you, Matt! Thank you.

74
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:13,878
MATT: A supportive significant other. Wednesday 
Club, Taliesin! Do you want to talk about Wednesday Club?

75
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,094
TALIESIN: Actually, this one, it's going to be
Matt Key is taking the reins on this one, so I

76
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:21,438
don't even-- I'm not sure he's settled on what's
going on, but I think we were talking about maybe

77
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:24,744
Brian K. Vaughan and looking at his whole body of
work, which would be a lot of fun.

78
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,346
MATT: There you go, that'll be fun.

79
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,279
TALIESIN: TV writer and comic book writer. Could
be cool.

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,774
MATT: Fantastic. And of course we have Talks
Machina next Tuesday, live here on Twitch and

81
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:39,370
Alpha at 7PM Pacific with our wonderful host,
Brian Wayne Foster.

82
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,903
TRAVIS: Except there won't be one.

83
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:43,426
MATT: Oh wait, there won't be one this week! Never
mind, 'cause they're going to be on vacation.

84
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:46,958
TRAVIS: 'Cause you're going out of the country.
They're going to-- Where are you going,

85
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,167
the North Pole?

86
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:52,470
ASHLEY: I wish we were going to the North Pole. We
are going to Mexico!

87
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,942
MATT: Let's be nice and vague. Going to a place
that's pretty.

88
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,959
ASHLEY: We're going to a place.

89
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,332
MATT: Which, as a note, as far as Brian was
saying, you guys really haven't had a vacation

90
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:04,817
together, ever.

91
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:05,714
ASHLEY: Never.

92
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,503
MATT: So, super excited that you guys have the
chance to do that.

93
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,724
ASHLEY: We've almost been dating for five years
and we've never gone on a vacation together.

94
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:11,255
TRAVIS: Y'all are dating?

95
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,900
(laughter)

96
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,093
LAURA: Wait. What?

97
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,829
MATT: Well, that'll be fun. Yeah!

98
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:24,887
MARISHA: Also, your Date with Matt Mercer in a
Silk Robe, thanks to Brian Wayne Foster, will be

99
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,369
up on YouTube tomorrow at 10AM.

100
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,903
MATT: Ho boy.

101
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,873
MARISHA: Is that okay?

102
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:35,320
MATT: Yeah, it's fine. Prepare for a lot of port
drinking.

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,836
ASHLEY: Boy George! Boy George! I get it a lot. I
get that.

104
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:46,262
LAURA: What? You don't look like-- With a lot of
makeup, maybe?

105
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,987
MATT: Awesome, so tomorrow? All right, for those
of you guys who missed it, you'll be able to see

106
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:52,415
it tomorrow. No, that's fine, bring tissues.

107
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,405
TALIESIN: That could go a number of ways.

108
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,127
MATT: That it can.

109
00:05:58,127 --> 00:05:59,538
TALIESIN: Sorry.

110
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:06,058
MATT: But no, thank you all. Thank you all who
came on Tuesday to chat and talk and create some

111
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:14,369
fun future characters for this storyline in the
future, it'll be fun. Anyway, do we have anything

112
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,677
else anyone wants to mention, or 
shall we continue?

113
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,457
SAM: Did you already do the shirts?

114
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,097
MATT: We did the shirts.

115
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,838
That is so nightmarish, Sam.

116
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:24,934
LAURA: I love it.

117
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,600
SAM: It's an homage.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,559
TRAVIS: It looks like Mercer's eating the table.

119
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:32,161
MATT: What I'm looking forward to is the
eventuality that you have enough of these shirts

120
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,265
that your closet has a section that's just my
face.

121
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:37,414
SAM: Your face, my face.

122
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:43,607
MATT: Yeah, it's just this face is printed, and
just having your wife eventually come up to me and

123
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,140
having you go--

124
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,841
SAM: I might have enough that we can all wear one
one night.

125
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:52,630
(laughter)

126
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:56,593
SAM: Let me think on that.

127
00:06:56,728 --> 00:07:04,063
MATT: All righty, then, without further ado, let's
jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

128
00:07:04,133 --> 00:08:34,804
[dramatic music]

129
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:41,865
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. So, last we left
off, Vox Machina, having completed a multitude of

130
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:50,682
various quests over a prolonged period of time,
found themselves free of immediate necessity and

131
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:51,592
danger.

132
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,160
TRAVIS: What?

133
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,288
MARISHA: Brought peace to the world forever.

134
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:56,566
MATT: No, that's not true.

135
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,360
MARISHA: Nothing bad will ever happen again.

136
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,925
MATT: (laughs) That's not how this works.

137
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,571
(laughter)

138
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,364
SAM: Credits.

139
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:12,916
MATT: So, as the last episode wound down and
friendships were strengthened, you all then began

140
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:19,090
to ponder about what you wanted to do with the
time before you. And today we return approximately

141
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:27,501
one year after we left off. So, we met earlier
this week to discuss this. We went through a

142
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:33,973
various number of things you wanted to accomplish,
both as individuals and some of you in groups. So

143
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:40,246
we're going to go ahead and go over those elements
for you guys and get everyone up to speed with

144
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,529
what exactly has transpired in this year period of
time.

145
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,197
LIAM: Show and tell!

146
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,498
MATT: So, who would like to begin?

147
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,641
SAM: We're just going to share?

148
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:51,923
LAURA: Just say what we did, what we
accomplished?

149
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,149
LIAM: Summer vacation!

150
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,183
MATT: Share elements of it, and then some elements
will be roleplayed, because that's

151
00:09:58,183 --> 00:09:59,414
what I want to do.

152
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:00,980
LAURA: Because that's what I want to do.

153
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,310
MATT: Yeah. So.

154
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,694
TRAVIS: Are you pointing at me? Okay, okay. I'll
start.

155
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:08,904
MATT: All right, so, Grog, what are some of the things
you did?

156
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:18,023
TRAVIS: Because I single-handedly established
peace across Exandria, I found myself bored, in

157
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:25,769
need of action. And so I sought out where the
fight would now be. I looked for Scanlan a little

158
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,801
bit along the way. I didn't find him.

159
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,897
MATT: No, you did not.

160
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:33,522
TRAVIS: I looked for, like, magical items along
the way. I didn't find them. So I went to

161
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:41,714
Vasselheim, which is where the Slayer's Take is.
And I think before I left, I wanted to get some

162
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:51,302
personal things, like, done to my body. So I had
the bear tattoo that I filleted of off Kevdak, and

163
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:55,100
I had it tanned, and then I got a copy of that
tattoo on my back.

164
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,232
MATT: Yeah.

165
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,725
TRAVIS: Because that shit's behind me.

166
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,295
ALL: Ooh!

167
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:07,518
MATT: So you now have Kevdak's bear-totem tattoo
that was on his chest, now on your back.

168
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:08,726
TRAVIS: Yep.

169
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,707
MATT: Out of sheer disrespect for him.

170
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:11,569
TRAVIS: Totes.

171
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,427
MATT: I love it.

172
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,404
LIAM: Did you get a bear ass on your bare ass?

173
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:22,279
TRAVIS: Much better idea. I also took Kevdak's
skull, the top of it, and I had a new cup, a new

174
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,972
mug made out of it. With metal bits and stuff,
with a handle.

175
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:27,758
MATT: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

176
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:31,190
TRAVIS: I don't understand how, but it looks
really great. It's like metal and bone, and I

177
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,948
(drinking sounds). That's me.

178
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:35,293
MATT: That's delicious.

179
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,964
TRAVIS: I just choked on a peanut.

180
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,927
LAURA: Yeah. Oh Grog. I heard it happen.

181
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:48,178
TRAVIS: So, I went to Vasselheim, and I defended
my title in the Crucible.

182
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,722
MATT: Yeah. Met multiple times.

183
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,608
TRAVIS: Multiple times.

184
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:55,824
MATT: Including once against a familiar
individual called Kern the Hammer.

185
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:58,037
TRAVIS: Kern the Hammer, he came back with that
monk shit.

186
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:00,370
MATT: Yeah. And did not prevail.

187
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,734
TRAVIS: Nope.

188
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:06,847
MATT: However, he did come back to you, requesting
to learn and train under you, to teach him your

189
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,760
ways. To which you said--

190
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,713
TRAVIS: I forgot. No. Yes. I said yes.

191
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,921
MATT: You said no.

192
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,383
TRAVIS: I said no.

193
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,428
(laughter)

194
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:21,199
MATT: That's what you told me, at least.

195
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,425
TRAVIS: I said no. I said no, because I was like,
you've got to drink, all the time, and this, and

196
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:32,821
he just wasn't up to snuff. That, and I should not
be teaching anyone anything. So then I went to the

197
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:40,134
Slayer's Take, right, in search of big game. And I
had fun with that for a while, but it just wasn't

198
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:45,990
quite the same. It wasn't crazy-ass, you know,
ancient dragons or nothing. It just wasn't quite

199
00:12:45,990 --> 00:13:00,024
up to snuff. But I did have my curiosity about the
Deck of Many Things piqued. So, at some point

200
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:08,225
along the way, Vex's warnings ringing in my ears,
I found a nice drunk sap to--

201
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:17,698
MATT: So, so, as you are wandering down an evening
byway in the Quadroads of Vasselheim, a number of

202
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:27,355
cups in yourself, you hiccup loudly and glance off
to the side to find one gentleman who's been far

203
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:31,791
deeper in his cups and is currently trying to
steady himself against the stone wall in an

204
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,170
alleyway.

205
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,223
TRAVIS: Yup. Hey, you!

206
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:38,183
MATT: "What?"

207
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:43,585
TRAVIS: You. You look like a mighty warrior. Do
you need another drink?

208
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,987
MATT: "Oh, if you're buying, yeah."

209
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:51,746
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do. I have one. And I pour him a
little bit from the keg. Hey, do you have like, a

210
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:55,556
wife, kids, attachments? Anyone that would miss
you?

211
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:59,456
MATT: "You think if I did I'd be drinking this
hard?"

212
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:06,171
TRAVIS: I'm going to take that as a no. Cool, hey,
look, I don't know if you're interested, but I

213
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:16,029
have, in my possession, something really cool. And
I take out the Deck. Do you know what this is?

214
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,335
MATT: "I have no idea."

215
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,705
TRAVIS: Great! Great! We're in the street, right?

216
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:24,554
MATT: Yeah. You're near a thoroughfare and there's
a small alley off to the side.

217
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:28,750
TRAVIS: Good. Follow me into this alley and it'll
be a deal. Just follow me over here.

218
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,262
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With advantage,
because he's really drunk.

219
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:37,507
MARISHA: For anyone who's watching, this is like,
abduction, how to not-- 101, self-defense.

220
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:38,626
MATT: This is terrible.

221
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,657
LIAM: I mean, he's either changing this guy's life
for the better, or murdering him.

222
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,036
TRAVIS: 19 plus one.

223
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:50,018
MATT: (laughs) You watch as in the center of his
pupils a little sparkle of interest kicks in. And,

224
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:54,602
I mean, five percent soberer at the prospect of
something fun of this stranger that gave him a

225
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,472
drink and goes: "Wait, what are you talking
about?"

226
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:04,345
TRAVIS: Well, listen. I am kind of like an
evangelical spreader of good news. And I found

227
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:10,517
this. And one time I pulled a card out and I got a
magic weapon. It was amazing. And I just figured,

228
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:13,911
like, you look like a guy that would appreciate
such a weapon, so--

229
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,110
MATT: (belches)

230
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:22,209
TRAVIS: -- and I open the Deck. I thought maybe
you would like to draw a card.

231
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:32,841
MATT: He takes a second and looks around. Looks at
the Deck. "Is this some sort of a magic trick?"

232
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:37,318
TRAVIS: Yes. Yep.

233
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,679
MATT: "All right. Do you want me to tell you what
it is?"

234
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:50,346
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah. Just draw it and-- Actually,
just hold it and don't tell me what it is.

235
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,592
MATT: Okay. Let me get my cards out.

236
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,030
LAURA: Oh my God.

237
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,496
ASHLEY: You have an actual set?

238
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,653
LAURA: What the actual fuck is 
happening right now?

239
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:00,824
TRAVIS: It was a fucking year. Did you not think
this was going to happen?

240
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:04,303
(laughter)

241
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,693
TRAVIS: It probably happened in the first week.

242
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:10,177
LIAM: This is the first of ten guys.

243
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,133
TRAVIS: Lot of problems, lot of drinking, lot of
fighting. Ran out of shit.

244
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,262
SAM: What if you die? What if you die right now?

245
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:17,713
TRAVIS: I'm not. He's drawing the card.

246
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,616
LAURA: Yeah, but you could still die.

247
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:20,994
SAM: It could kill-- It could kill you too.

248
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:22,139
TRAVIS: Could it?

249
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,172
SAM: I think so.

250
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,317
TRAVIS: I'm not really sure on how this shit
works. But I need another card to

251
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,448
come out of that Deck.

252
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:28,292
MATT: Yeah, maybe.

253
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,444
LAURA: Oh my God. Oh no, what did he pull. What
did he pull?

254
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:34,326
MATT: No. No. No. Huh. I'm going to let somebody
else pull this. Who wants to pull it?

255
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,327
TRAVIS: Oh, you raise your hand to pull from the
Deck? Thats some bullshit.

256
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:43,698
LAURA: Oh no. Should I turn it?

257
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,547
TRAVIS: Ooh. Ooh.

258
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,643
LAURA: Do you know what that is?

259
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,145
TRAVIS: No, I don't remember.

260
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,050
MATT: Okay.

261
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,268
MARISHA: It's just, it looked ominous.

262
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,755
TRAVIS: It was a face card, though.

263
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,255
TALIESIN: It was a face card. Oh. Oh.

264
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:57,848
MATT: (laughs)

265
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,997
LAURA: Oh no. Is it amazing? Did he get something
really good?

266
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,790
TALIESIN: You're the DM now.

267
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:11,050
MATT: Hold on. I have to roll a die first.
(laughs) He takes the card and looks at it. Turns

268
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:19,683
around and shows you, and it's this tarot card of
a beautiful moonscape, with an open night sky. I

269
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:23,833
believe that's what it is. Yeah, that's what it
is. He puts it back in the Deck, and is like: "All

270
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:36,404
"right, what's the trick? I'm-- I'm feeling a
little-- a little strange."

271
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:43,864
TRAVIS: Could you describe to me how you feel
right now?

272
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:55,501
MATT: And he's like trying to contemplate it. He
goes: "Wait a second.

273
00:17:55,551 --> 00:18:02,257
"I wish that I was a powerful lord of the 
Quadroads."

274
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:08,637
And there's a strange,
tingling visual image as the cloth around him that

275
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,893
was tattered and worn-out becomes beautiful
silks--

276
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,945
LAURA: Oh my God.

277
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:20,179
MATT: The drunkenness fades from him
ever-so-slightly, and now he looks washed. And you

278
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:28,487
glance over at the far end of the alleyway, and
there's a guy there who's dressed in long, long

279
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:33,747
tails and a coat and goes: "Sir, how long are you
going to be?"

280
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:41,121
He goes: "Right with you. I don't even know what 
his name is. Well, thank you so much, stranger."

281
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,552
And he pats you on the shoulder.

282
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:43,767
TRAVIS: Grog. Grog.

283
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:44,513
MATT: "Grog."

284
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:45,509
TRAVIS: Grog Strongjaw.

285
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:46,566
MATT: "Grog Strongthings."

286
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,804
TRAVIS: Maker of kings.

287
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:48,707
MATT: "Great."

288
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:49,460
TRAVIS: Yup.

289
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,921
MATT: "I still got one more of these." And he
walks off and runs off to the carriage.

290
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,444
LAURA: He got two wishes?

291
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,642
MATT: 1d3 wishes.

292
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,798
TRAVIS: Are you fucking serious?

293
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:03,248
SAM: Wait, he got two wishes? You gave away two
wishes?

294
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:05,421
TRAVIS: (shouts) Wait! What was your name?

295
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,054
MATT: The queen of diamonds was the card.

296
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,523
TRAVIS: Did I get his name?

297
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,464
MATT: You didn't get his name. He just runs off.

298
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:14,807
TALIESIN: Lord of the Quadroads, now.

299
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,165
SAM: You just got a cure for cancer, and you gave
it away?

300
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:23,132
LAURA: Wait, wait, I have a question. Once a card
has been pulled, is it gone from the Deck, or does

301
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:24,245
it go back in?

302
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,599
LIAM: Some go back, and some--

303
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,893
LAURA: Oh my God.

304
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:29,425
TRAVIS: I should just pull all of these right
now.

305
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,936
(groaning)

306
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,586
TRAVIS: I mean, obviously, it was just a little
appetizer, the first one.

307
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:36,345
MATT: Well, let me see here. Let me see. Let me
see.

308
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,741
TRAVIS: That is way better.

309
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:45,558
TALIESIN: (laughs) You want to pull another one.

310
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,142
SAM: Matt's verifying.

311
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,977
LAURA: Verifying that he did the right thing?

312
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,818
TRAVIS: He's double-checking.

313
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,875
SAM: This is important.

314
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,550
LAURA: I know. Yeah.

315
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,911
MATT: Once the card is drawn, it fades from
existence.

316
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:58,597
TALIESIN: Oh there's no other-- No, the Wish card
goes.

317
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,685
MATT: Yeah.

318
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:03,695
LAURA: The best card is fucking gone. It is the
best card, isn't it?

319
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,424
LIAM: Now the Deck is slightly shittier.

320
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:07,016
SAM: Way shittier!

321
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:09,004
MATT: But you know what?

322
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:18,254
TRAVIS: You know what? Only one person picked that
card from the Deck. So it's not really my fault.

323
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:19,814
SAM: It's Laura's fault?

324
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:20,947
TALIESIN: Good roll, Laura.

325
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:25,293
LAURA: Thank you, thank you. Hey, man.

326
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,028
MATT: That one's gone, now.

327
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,546
TALIESIN: Lord of the Quadroads now owes you a
favor.

328
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,461
LAURA: Yeah!

329
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,302
MARISHA: That's true!

330
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,723
TRAVIS: It was the queen of diamonds, right?
Yeah.

331
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,316
ASHLEY: I say, at the end of all this, we all pick
one.

332
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:42,286
LIAM: Who was that man? That was Taliesin Jaffe,
Mayor of Ren Faire!

333
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:44,426
TALIESIN: Huzzah!

334
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,810
ASHLEY: Huzzah!

335
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,357
LAURA: What's going on, Matt?

336
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:50,807
MATT: Just double-checking to make sure the card
goes away, and it does, according to how it's

337
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,942
written.

338
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:56,041
TRAVIS: Clearly, nobody in my group knows what
they're talking about.

339
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,965
This Deck is a mighty gift!

340
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,556
LAURA: Fuck.

341
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:02,389
TALIESIN: We're doomed.

342
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,982
TRAVIS: And I put it back in the Bag of Holding.

343
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,549
MATT: Okay. I was like, "Oh god, is he going to
draw another card?"

344
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,372
LIAM: Two-hour combat scenario.

345
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,974
TRAVIS: I want to, really bad, but I have an open
bar tab.

346
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:23,070
MATT: Okay then! You, in your time away, radically
changed some poor man's life! And, apparently,

347
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,572
Wished himself to some level of nobility within
the Quadroads of Vasselheim, with one Wish still

348
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,828
standing!

349
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,226
LAURA: That's amazing.

350
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,503
TRAVIS: Okay!

351
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,911
MARISHA: Remember that guy.

352
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:37,056
TRAVIS: Lord of the Crossroads? Quadroads?

353
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:40,865
MATT: Well, there are many lords and ladies of the
Quadroads, he's just now one of them.

354
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,696
TRAVIS: Good deal. That happened.

355
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:47,464
MATT: I was thinking to myself it was either going
to be that or some grim reaper's going to show up

356
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:48,688
and cut his head off.

357
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:55,949
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted, really. Just cheer
him on, maybe have a little better counterweight

358
00:21:55,949 --> 00:22:00,882
for my expectation of the Deck, but now I just
want to pull one every day. Nothing but good shit

359
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:05,473
happens! Magic weapon! Fucking Wishes!

360
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:14,387
MATT: So if this happened early in your year, do
you still resist the urge as the year progresses?

361
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:15,993
LAURA: Oh no.

362
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:16,930
TRAVIS: No.

363
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,987
LAURA: Oh, Jesus!

364
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:18,896
TALIESIN: Yay!

365
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:22,569
MATT: How long does it take until the urge 
creeps up again?

366
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:27,864
TRAVIS: I mean, oh god, why do I have to be so
fucking true to my character?

367
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:29,627
TALIESIN: There's nothing we can do!

368
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,169
LAURA: We're not even there!

369
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,772
LIAM: Probably thinks he has three birthdays a
year, right? So.

370
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:41,820
TRAVIS: I will probably wait to take it back so
that I can open it with my good friend, Pike.

371
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,041
Because she'll understand that this is an awesome
deck.

372
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:51,958
MATT: Which actually plays into her opening. The
other thing you did, which happens towards the end

373
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,196
of the year, is you said you went to the
Frostweald.

374
00:22:54,196 --> 00:23:04,064
TRAVIS: I did, yeah. I was curious about the
werewolves. So I went to go see the nymph in the

375
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,499
frozen lake. You know, the one that's all about
Grog.

376
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,681
MATT: Mm-hm.

377
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:12,705
TRAVIS: So I had a conversation with her, and I
felt really bad because I wasn't as affectionate

378
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:17,959
as last time, so I gave her this palm-sized ruby
that was at the bottom of the bag. Looked really

379
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,657
pretty, so I gave it to her.

380
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,900
MATT: She thanked you.

381
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,673
TRAVIS: She did. We hit it off. And I asked her if
the werewolves were just in the Feywild.

382
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,955
Turns out--

383
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:31,890
MATT: Lycanthropy is scattered throughout the
planes.

384
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,373
TRAVIS: Well, I didn't fucking know that.

385
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:40,781
MATT: Now you do. She passed that information on
to you. All right. So. That's the truncated

386
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:46,076
example of Grog's year. We might come back to it
here in a minute. Next up would be Pike, because

387
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:49,395
that's a good transition point there. So, what'd
you do?

388
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:56,164
ASHLEY: All right. So I followed, in the
beginning-- did the guy pick the Deck in

389
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,698
Vasselheim? Or were you--

390
00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,961
MATT AND TRAVIS: It was in Vasselheim.

391
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:07,716
ASHLEY: So I went with Grog to Vasselheim. And
because I wanted to go and read and

392
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,914
work on some things--

393
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:12,725
MATT: Check in on your temple that you built
there.

394
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:22,543
ASHLEY: Yes. I ended up fighting (laughs) because
I saw him fight, and I was like, oh, I should

395
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:23,984
probably just try it!

396
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,317
TRAVIS: Yeah!

397
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:27,112
ASHLEY: And did well.

398
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:28,376
MATT: Yeah!

399
00:24:28,376 --> 00:24:31,980
ASHLEY: I'm the second champion under Grog.

400
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,589
LAURA: Fuck yes!

401
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:37,014
MATT: And as everyone was pitting both of you
against each other for another championship bout,

402
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:40,559
you both decided to--

403
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,337
ASHLEY: Do it. No! To fight!

404
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:47,123
TRAVIS: To kill each other.

405
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,899
ASHLEY: We didn't end up doing it.

406
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:49,729
TRAVIS: Nope.

407
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:50,502
ASHLEY: We just shook--

408
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:51,367
TRAVIS: Yep.

409
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:52,911
ASHLEY -- and we knew both of us were just too
powerful--

410
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:53,887
TRAVIS: Too true!

411
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,670
ASHLEY: -- and I would win. So we just decided not
to do it.

412
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,698
TRAVIS: Two monsters of a feather stay in
leather.

413
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:07,035
ASHLEY: Two monsters of a feather. Also, in that
time, which was a five-month period, we had a lot

414
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:12,581
of lessons and taught Grog how to read.

415
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:13,796
LAURA: Yay!

416
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:16,052
ASHLEY: Just a little bit.

417
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,453
TRAVIS: Just a little.

418
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:20,102
MATT: You can slowly read four- to five-letter
words.

419
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,289
MARISHA: Five-letter words is a big deal!

420
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,199
LAURA: That's a big fucking deal.

421
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,841
MATT: He knows how to write his name now.

422
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,526
LAURA: Yeah!

423
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,081
MATT: And he can write a full sentence over a
short rest.

424
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:30,906
TRAVIS: Yep.

425
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,902
(laughter)

426
00:25:32,902 --> 00:25:35,950
TRAVIS: Meat. Cat.

427
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,703
LIAM: Farts. Farts.

428
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,406
TRAVIS: Doody, with a Y.

429
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:42,369
MARISHA: Does he get exhausted from reading?

430
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:44,512
MATT: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

431
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:46,790
(laughter)

432
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,354
ASHLEY: Wait, what did you ask?

433
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:52,701
MARISHA: If he gets mentally exhausted from
reading. Takes a point of exhaustion when he tries

434
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,584
to read.

435
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:55,001
ASHLEY: I'm so tired!

436
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,815
TRAVIS: I'm tired now!

437
00:25:56,815 --> 00:26:01,326
ASHLEY: I took some time to learn how to be just a
little bit more stealthy.

438
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,616
LAURA: Yeah!

439
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:13,637
ASHLEY: Just did a little bit of training. Not a
ton, but maybe, we'll see. I also went to check on

440
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:20,206
great-great-grandpappy Wilhand to see how he was
doing, and he's doing fine. He's older.

441
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:23,158
MATT: Wilhand. Yeah, he's doing good. The home
that was damaged in the Umbrasyl attack on

442
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:28,161
Westruun, your room has been repaired. Though it's
taken a little while, because it's mainly just him

443
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:34,149
hiring who he can at the time. But he's doing
well. He's "an old gnome, but still kicking

444
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:38,150
"around! Still doing his best, still doing his
prayers to Sarenrae,

445
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,978
"glad to see you coming, saying hi."

446
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:43,041
ASHLEY: Oh, of course. Always.

447
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:46,455
MARISHA: Does he still have Fassbender?

448
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:53,760
ASHLEY: I've totally forgot about Fassbender!
Didn't he die?

449
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,958
LAURA: No, no, no, we left Fassbender with him.

450
00:26:55,958 --> 00:27:02,368
ASHLEY: Oh shit, I forgot about Fassbender.

451
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:04,994
SAM: No, I thought that we lost him in the dragon
fight.

452
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:06,773
LAURA: No, no, no, we left him with Wilhand.

453
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,264
ASHLEY: He's keeping him safe. He probably helped
build the house.

454
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:16,222
MATT: If you ask him about that, ask him where
Fassbender is, he's like, "Oh, this nice older

455
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:22,133
"fella came by and said it was his property? So I
gave it back to him. He seemed very--"

456
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,738
LAURA: It was that dick.

457
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:30,403
MATT: "-- very intent on receiving his property,
and I wasn't about to argue."

458
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,246
ASHLEY: That's okay.

459
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:34,722
LAURA: He was technically his.

460
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:47,046
ASHLEY: It was technically his. I also sent a
little bit of money to -- I don't know where they

461
00:27:47,046 --> 00:27:53,901
are, but I hired somebody to send a letter and
some money to some of my family.

462
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:56,692
MATT: Yeah, some of the Trickfoots.

463
00:27:56,692 --> 00:28:07,955
ASHLEY: Yeah. And what else? Oh, last, but
certainly not least, we opened up a bakery.

464
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,410
SAM: Oh, yeah!

465
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,916
LAURA: Yes we did!

466
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,033
SAM: What's it called?

467
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,534
ASHLEY: It's called-- tell 'em.

468
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:17,631
LAURA: It's called-- well, this was Tary's idea--
it's called the Slayer's Cake.

469
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:22,398
ASHLEY: And we have many, many items.

470
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,111
LAURA: Delicious Sun Treats.

471
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:29,615
ASHLEY: Sun Treats. Bear Claws. Angel Food Cake.

472
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:32,463
MARISHA: Some Tree Bark that Keyleth made.

473
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:35,092
ASHLEY: So many treats and treasures.

474
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,581
SAM: Bear Claws?

475
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,502
MARISHA: Definitely Bear Claws, yeah. Out of
Whitestone, of course.

476
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:40,598
LAURA: Obviously, yeah.

477
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,968
MATT: Bear Claws? Is that it? Did you guys make
Bear Claws?

478
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:48,429
ASHLEY: So Tary, Keyleth, Vex and I just decided
on a drunken evening, we were like, we should open

479
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:49,294
up a bakery!

480
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,799
LAURA: Let's just fuckin' do it!

481
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,227
(laughter)

482
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:55,745
LAURA: We found this building that was pretty
abandoned in Whitestone, we fuckin' put in a

483
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:56,589
bakery.

484
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:59,321
MARISHA: We should just do this tomorrow. We
should do it tomorrow.

485
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,279
MATT: Whitestone needs more commerce.

486
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,131
LAURA: That's right.

487
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:02,992
ASHLEY: It does.

488
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,739
MATT: And there are plenty of vacant buildings
that are starting to fill up as

489
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:05,677
people move back in.

490
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,158
LAURA: That's why we did it, 'cause we wanted to
help the economy.

491
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,295
MARISHA AND ASHLEY: Yeah.

492
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:12,392
TALIESIN: Anything to get you out of the wine
cellar is such a good idea.

493
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:16,039
MARISHA: Yeah. Plus, small-business tax breaks, it
was good all the way around.

494
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,592
TALIESIN: You're not getting a tax break.

495
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:18,546
MARISHA: What?

496
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:21,070
ASHLEY: I did try looking for Scanlan at one
point.

497
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,278
MATT: You did, yeah.

498
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,485
ASHLEY: But I couldn't find him.

499
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:31,187
MATT: Yeah. It led you all the way to Emon, I
think it was, then it went cold. Yeah.

500
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:38,911
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yes. And what was the last thing.
Oh, we went to go see--

501
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,404
MATT: We'll get to that.

502
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,776
ASHLEY: -- something great.

503
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,266
MATT: Yeah, we'll get to that.

504
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,261
ASHLEY: Yeah. So that's what I did on my year of
break.

505
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,013
MATT: All right, who wants to go next?

506
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:49,136
SAM: Are we going in order, or-- what are we
doing?

507
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:54,923
LAURA: I mean, I guess we can, yeah. All right,
well, I spent my beginning of the year trying to

508
00:29:54,923 --> 00:30:00,828
find the baby of the Grey Render that I sent on
its way. Mortally.

509
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:06,291
MATT: Yes, you discovered that there was an
offspring. There was a singular offspring in the

510
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:13,595
Parchwood, not too far from where you saw it
emerge in your vision. And upon finally finding

511
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:20,364
it, it was young and defensive and feral and,
after--

512
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:21,538
LAURA: Very angry.

513
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:27,136
MATT: Very angry. And day after day you returned
with various foods and meat and trying to connect

514
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:31,266
with it, and did not succeed.

515
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,948
LAURA: I did not. I failed miserably.

516
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,480
LIAM: So many shit rolls.

517
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,257
LAURA: So many shit rolls!

518
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:46,215
MATT: Yeah. It fled southward into the Parchwood,
and while you now have sent your Grey Hunt that is

519
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:49,824
now working below you to keep an eye out for it,
it has not been seen since.

520
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:54,376
LAURA: Yes. I am on the lookout in case it comes
close to our territory. I want to keep our people

521
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:59,912
safe. But I'm not going to go and try to kill it
just for the shits.

522
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:00,905
MATT: Yeah.

523
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:04,431
LAURA: Yeah. I also built my house!

524
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,864
MATT: Mm-hm.

525
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:14,631
LAURA: Yes! New house, new house! And built up the
guard. And I made a nice little animal sanctuary

526
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:21,422
for Trinket, a nice garden area for him to hang
out in, and other wildlife should they so desire.

527
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:27,684
Oh, and Tary, Tary moved in.

528
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,590
SAM: I didn't have a place to stay.

529
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,959
LAURA: And I have such a large house, you might as
well just come and live over here, right?

530
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,917
SAM: Well, I mean, if you'll have me.

531
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,133
LAURA: Of course, darling!

532
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,444
SAM: I can sleep on a couch.

533
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:40,990
LAURA: No, no, no, you'll have your own room.

534
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,969
SAM: Excellent, because I don't think I could
sleep on a couch.

535
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,701
(laughter)

536
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:49,730
LAURA: You're wonderful.

537
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,627
SAM: You're not so bad, either.

538
00:31:51,627 --> 00:32:03,023
LAURA: Oh, you! And I became, for Whitestone, the
ambassador to Syngorn. So I'm working on making a

539
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,910
Teleportation Circle, is that what they're
called?

540
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:13,212
MATT: Yeah. You're having a Teleportation Circle
placed within your estate in Whitestone, and at

541
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:17,586
the end of the year it's still two weeks out from
creation. So it's going to take a little while

542
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,232
longer, but it is in the process.

543
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:29,759
LAURA: Trying to make amends, to make peace with
my father, trying to forgive and grow and move on.

544
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,333
And while Tary was living in the house--

545
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,885
SAM: Braiding hair.

546
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:42,297
LAURA: Oh my gosh, just doing so many things, we
decided to make armor out of Vorugal, so I have

547
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:47,831
new white dragon leather armor that Tary helped me
enchant. Actually, that Tary enchanted and I hung

548
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:50,198
out with him, for five months, while he did that.

549
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,498
MATT: Yeah.

550
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:52,697
SAM: Yeah, that happened.

551
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,392
(laughter)

552
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:58,278
SAM: A lot of hard work, but I learned something
from it.

553
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:01,462
LAURA: Yeah, that I'm really good company,
basically.

554
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:04,539
SAM: Yeah, yep. She knows two songs. She sings
them all the time.

555
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,804
(laughter)

556
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:10,096
LAURA: And Trinket gives amazing massages.

557
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,131
SAM: That's true.

558
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:17,999
LAURA: Yes. I think that's pretty much it, outside
of the bakery, which has taken up a lot of time,

559
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,148
really.

560
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:21,007
MATT: Yeah. You did also research some--

561
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:24,581
LAURA: Yes! I spent a fuckton of time! I'm
building up my library in the house, so I spent a

562
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:30,535
lot of time researching Orcus and the Raven Queen
and learning everything that I can about all of

563
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,252
them. All of them.

564
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:36,683
MATT: All right. And Vax?

565
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,597
LIAM: Everything's going to start to get a little
intertwined here now.

566
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,803
MATT: Which is why I led it along this way, so,
yeah.

567
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:46,443
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. So, overarching theme is, there
was a lot of Zephra and chill.

568
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,286
(laughter)

569
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:56,315
LIAM: Enjoyed not being on death's door every
fucking day and relaxing and being the right hand

570
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:59,434
of the Queen back in Zephra, and--

571
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,791
MARISHA: Chief.

572
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:10,277
LIAM: I'm still learning the lingo. Getting to
know Korren a bit more. Keyleth helped me-- I let

573
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:15,964
a lot of blood and made a small altar to the Raven
Queen in Zephra and it's been all flowered and

574
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:21,932
vined out. And while we spent most of our time--
Oh, tattoos, want to talk tattoos?

575
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:30,512
MARISHA: Yeah, since Keyleth-- the mantle's a
little heavy and flashy and a little formal to

576
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:36,647
wear all the time, but wanted something to still
represent my chiefdom.

577
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:38,826
SAM: Did you get antlers tattooed on your face?

578
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,339
(laughter)

579
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,597
MATT: Just right there.

580
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:46,645
LAURA: Ooh, that actually could be pretty tight.
Like those elves in Dragon Age.

581
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:55,040
MARISHA: Keyleth goes hard, yeah. No, I got the
traditional Ashari tattoos of the mantle across

582
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,525
her chest and shoulders to mimic that.

583
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:00,395
LAURA: That's super tight.

584
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:05,393
LIAM: We went together. Yours took much longer
than mine did. Yeah.

585
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:10,316
MARISHA: It took a while. It's old
needle-and-hammer style. All traditional.

586
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,690
LIAM: Yeah, and about two-thirds of the way
through yours, they started on mine, which is just

587
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,656
a pair of antlers on the right bicep here.

588
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,152
MARISHA: See, he got the antlers.

589
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,135
SAM: Nice.

590
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:20,395
LAURA: Oh, did you really?

591
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:21,732
LIAM: I did. Not on my face.

592
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:23,796
LAURA: Oh, that's great. That's so cute.

593
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,259
MATT: Right next to the barbed wire.

594
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:34,362
LIAM: Yeah. Keyleth for life. So we spent a lot of
time in Zephra, but since have-druid-will-travel,

595
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:40,490
we met up with these two quite a bit. About once a
month, we would have three- or four-day weekends.

596
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,409
We'd spent time in Whitestone. We went to
Vasselheim a lot. The twins spent a lot of time in

597
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,437
the library.

598
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,584
LAURA: Yes, we did.

599
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,737
LIAM: Reading a ton. I spent a lot of time at the
Raven Queen's temple, getting to know the people

600
00:35:52,737 --> 00:35:57,886
there, getting to know what the hell a cleric or a
priest or a paladin of the Raven Queen does, since

601
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,387
I didn't really have any time to do that.

602
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:06,086
MATT: Part of your process there, once you had
been fully accepted into the Order there, some of

603
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:12,136
the few responsibilities you had were, you were
called whenever relatively important figures in

604
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:18,245
the city had passed away, to go and give rites
when they were interred and be present during a

605
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:23,782
number of funerals in there. That was one of the
earlier responsibilities that was given to you

606
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,997
within Vasselheim while you were there.

607
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:30,972
LIAM: I tried to do a little observing, too, in
Zephra as well. I didn't want to interfere with

608
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:40,836
their customs, but it's like working at a funeral
home, and over time you just get used to it. A couple

609
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:46,054
of bits and pieces. I saw everybody, really. I
went on a man's weekend with Grog and killed

610
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:55,631
things, that was awesome. Talked a lot of shop
with Pike. God talk. The girls went off on their

611
00:36:55,631 --> 00:37:02,001
own a little bit, so I spent time trying to figure
out what it was Percival does in his workshop. He

612
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:04,652
lent me a book about the history of Whitestone.

613
00:37:04,652 --> 00:37:07,694
TALIESIN: I did, I also sent you on a tour of the
frescoes, it was quite nice.

614
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:13,746
LIAM: It's beautiful, once you're not screaming,
running on fire, you can really take in art and

615
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,113
pass notes.

616
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:19,552
TALIESIN: It had been years since I'd done it
without being on fire, running around. Yes.

617
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:25,449
LIAM: Also tried to locate Dr. Dranzel in an
effort to find Scanlan, but was unsuccessful.

618
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,975
MATT: Yes.

619
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:28,583
TRAVIS: You ate raw meat with me.

620
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,060
LIAM: Yeah, and kept it down.

621
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,511
TRAVIS: You did. Like a champ.

622
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:33,578
SAM: Do you like me? Check this box.

623
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:37,183
LIAM: Are we married? Yes or no.

624
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,207
(laughter)

625
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:41,064
TALIESIN: Check one. Carry on, carry on.

626
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:44,787
LIAM: Oh, and last thing, Vex took me to Syngorn
on one of her trips. Spent some time with little

627
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:48,682
sis. Not as much time with Dad. Some time with
Dad. We're all right.

628
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:50,823
LAURA: Eh, it's whatever.

629
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:51,918
LIAM: It's fine.

630
00:37:51,918 --> 00:38:02,065
MATT: Yeah, you've arranged a respect. There is no
familial bond, per se, with him, but a lot of the

631
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:07,787
tension has died away and there is a business,
positive interaction.

632
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:11,947
LAURA: Yeah, there's finally this feeling that we
don't need-- at least, for me-- his approval

633
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:13,795
anymore, which is very nice.

634
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:22,123
MATT: No, and he acknowledges that, and he seems
both simultaneously proud and sad, almost a mild

635
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:25,281
regret that, perhaps, I think he realizes now what
he missed out on.

636
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:26,837
LAURA: How fucking cool we are?

637
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:27,868
MATT: Kind of.

638
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:29,881
SAM: Well, you were until that.

639
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,193
(laughter)

640
00:38:31,193 --> 00:38:33,146
LAURA: Just so fucking cool. Thanks for the note.

641
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,959
LIAM: In character, in character. You know, elfs
going to elf, and there's

642
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,465
no getting around that, so.

643
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:45,198
MATT: Exactly. All righty, and I think I'm to
Marisha as Keyleth. Keyleth,

644
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,456
what you got going on?

645
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:50,754
MARISHA: Okay, so once again, lot of intertwining
starting to go on. Got our tattoos, took a little

646
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:57,508
bit of time. One of the big things that Keyleth
did over the course of the year, which took a

647
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:05,462
massive majority of her time, was she went on a
diplomacy mission to all four of the tribes as

648
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:17,330
well as Emon and Whitestone, and with the help of
Percy and Tary, we came up with a system that we

649
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:25,742
are calling the Crisis Orbs system, is what you
called it? Where we put magical orbs in each of

650
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:34,925
the cities that are basically giant panic beacons.
And each city got assigned a separate color, to

651
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:40,957
where if anything goes terribly wrong, someone can
hit that beacon and all of the crystals will light

652
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:45,958
up and whoever can respond first will do so.

653
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:46,864
MATT: Yeah.

654
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:48,900
TRAVIS: What if some shitty 11-year-old kid just
runs up and hits it?

655
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,188
MATT: They are heavily under guard.

656
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,053
TRAVIS: Oh. Smart thinking.

657
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:53,903
SAM: By a 12-year-old.

658
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:59,661
MARISHA: It's like how calling 911 is illegal. You
don't do that. You don't do that..

659
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:03,476
TALIESIN: You're not allowed in that room.
(laughs)

660
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:08,223
MARISHA: Yes, 'cause Keyleth does definitely--
Keyleth and a lot of the other Ashari dealt with a

661
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:15,848
little bit of guilt after Cinderking Thordak, and
wanted to make sure that if anything tragically

662
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:23,436
goes wrong again, we can potentially be faster to
respond. And have allies nearby. So that was a

663
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:33,590
massive part of it. I also went to Whitestone and
grabbed a little sprig off of the Sun Tree to

664
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:40,884
propagate one of my own trees back in Vesrah.
Spent a lot of time working on my alchemy, in

665
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:46,451
between. I imagine we have would have crafting
parties in Whitestone, yeah? And then, you know, I

666
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:47,770
would do some alchemy.

667
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,690
LAURA: I made friendship bracelets, she worked on
her alchemy. So--

668
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,860
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. It was great. It was great.
And he made dragon armor.

669
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,538
SAM: I was just making that fuckin' armor.

670
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,036
(laughter)

671
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,735
LAURA: It looked so good.

672
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,238
LIAM: Girl better appreciate.

673
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:04,167
MATT: It's not like you have to make the armor,
you commission the armor. You enchanted it for

674
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:04,987
five months.

675
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:05,993
SAM: That's right.

676
00:41:05,993 --> 00:41:10,466
MARISHA: Took trips with Vax, and had him as my
right-hand man.

677
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:13,713
LIAM: Unnecessary bodyguard, yeah.

678
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:14,847
MATT: Yeah.

679
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,014
LAURA: What's his official title?

680
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,600
SAM: Unnecessary bodyguard.

681
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,002
(laughter)

682
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:22,028
LIAM: It's Puddin'.

683
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:24,099
MATT: Coattails of The Tempest.

684
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:29,212
MARISHA: Sir Vax. The Gothy One.

685
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,380
SAM: Cervix?

686
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,503
(laughter)

687
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:32,654
MATT: Maybe not that one!

688
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:33,709
LIAM: That's Cervex.

689
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:34,833
LAURA: I like it.

690
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,580
(laughter)

691
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,935
MATT: And thus, another meme was built.

692
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:39,273
(laughter)

693
00:41:39,273 --> 00:41:44,947
MATT: Okay, and since you were the last of one of
the intertwined events, the four of you-- Keyleth,

694
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:49,253
Vax, Vex, and Pike-- all took a specific trip.

695
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:50,345
LAURA: And Tary.

696
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:56,658
MATT: I'm sorry, Tary came along too. So the five
of you guys took a journey into the Feywild in

697
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:58,407
search of the Theatre.

698
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,276
LIAM: (sings) The fuckin' Theatre.

699
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:03,643
TALIESIN: It was amazing-- I wasn't there, but it
was amazing.

700
00:42:03,643 --> 00:42:04,770
MATT: You weren't there.

701
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,473
MARISHA: Such a good show.

702
00:42:06,473 --> 00:42:11,569
LAURA: They integrated rap, too. It was like--

703
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:13,128
SAM: History? Wow.

704
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,925
LAURA: Yeah, it was like a whole new way to tell
history. It was just so good.

705
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:24,178
MATT: (laughs) So after searching for a few days,
up northward in the forest where you recall seeing

706
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:31,562
portions of the tree-- canopy line shifting and
seemingly vanishing and then reappearing, you

707
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:37,934
eventually stumbled upon a large, wooden
structure-- circular and tall, almost like a giant

708
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:45,746
crown of wood, it sat there-- and noticed that the
mists that hugged the base of this marsh, as it's

709
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:54,010
slowly recovering since Sondur fell. Still thick
marshland, but not quite as disgusting and corrupt

710
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:01,662
as it once was. The mists that clouded this area
were all gathering towards this wooden structure,

711
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:09,923
and you begin to see shapes in the mist. Heads.
Faces. Bodies. And you begin to realize that these

712
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:15,905
were all spirits of the marsh being summoned to
this structure. You all went, disguised as various

713
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:23,890
small flying insects-- or beast creatures-- and
managed to stealth into the entrance doors, into

714
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:35,134
this mossy marsh-rotted wood structure, and on the
inside saw the mist form an audience, within the

715
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:42,823
inside of this Globe Theatre-like structure, upon
which the central platform remained. A strange,

716
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:48,009
crystalline spark began to form upon that stage,
where a doorway opened and then, stepping from it,

717
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:56,050
a half-dozen elvish-looking figures, though their
skin is pale white-gray, their eyes white and

718
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:02,285
iris-less, their limbs lithe and thinner and
longer than elves you're used to seeing in your

719
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:06,846
experience. And, while none of you could
understand-- or most of you could understand the

720
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:09,831
language except for Keyleth and Taryon, I think it
was?

721
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,576
MARISHA: No, we were the ones that could.

722
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:14,330
MATT: Yeah, you guys were the only ones who could
understand it because you both knew Sylvan.

723
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,503
MARISHA: Correct.

724
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:23,132
MATT: What you saw was a brilliant three-act
performance for the undead spirits of the

725
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:31,386
surrounding marsh. Unaware of the serious danger
if any of you had been discovered. (laughs)

726
00:44:31,386 --> 00:44:32,656
LIAM: Do tell, Matt.

727
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:33,988
LAURA: Yeah, I know. I want to know.

728
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:35,004
MATT: No. You don't know.

729
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:36,187
LIAM: Aliens!

730
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:43,085
MATT: Go back. Go back. However, you watched the
performance entirely, did not gather their

731
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:49,332
attention. At which, the entity stepped back into a
doorway, and it closed off and you absconded from

732
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:53,009
the Theatre before the rest of the audience could
shift its way out and become the mists of the

733
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:54,211
Forests once again.

734
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:57,831
LIAM: This is their most sacred ceremony or
something?

735
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,462
MATT: You don't know.

736
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:00,719
LIAM: I don't.

737
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:02,283
MATT: You only know what they told you.

738
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,941
TALIESIN: You only have what I told you later,
it's pretty much--

739
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:10,157
MATT: Yeah. So as you guys returned from this and
described your experience to Percy, the only person

740
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,774
who really had spent a large portion of his youth
researching the Feywild, and having an interest in

741
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:18,019
these Fey creatures and their societies--

742
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,165
LAURA: He didn't want to go! Yeah, he had things
to copy.

743
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:24,753
TALIESIN: I had things to do, I wasn't entirely
clear about what you were planning to do. My god!

744
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:26,326
MARISHA: Sorry.

745
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:29,793
TALIESIN: No, it's great! You didn't die, you
weren't kidnapped,

746
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,806
your soul wasn't taken, you weren't--

747
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:33,325
LAURA: That could've happened?

748
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:35,229
TALIESIN: Yes, you watched the--

749
00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:37,665
MARISHA: The Royal Troupe of the--

750
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,660
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Unseelie Court.

751
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:47,405
TALIESIN: For god's sakes. Yes, a lot could've
happened. They have these little vignettes on

752
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:53,296
occasion that they use to sort of-- it's like a
nice little trap. They just like to grab people

753
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:57,521
and use them for various things, no one really
knows because no one ever comes back.

754
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,014
LIAM: Who are 'they'? The 'Unseelie court'?

755
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:06,420
TALIESIN: They're sort of the shadow court, I
suppose. They would be the-- for everything that

756
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,890
you saw in the Feywild, they are the thing that
the Feywild is a little sketchy about and a little

757
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,096
worried about.

758
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:13,243
LAURA: Ooh.

759
00:46:13,243 --> 00:46:16,041
LIAM: Well, listen, man. If I can't have the arts
in my life, I'd rather be dead.

760
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,689
TALIESIN: I respect that.

761
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:20,624
(laughter)

762
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:26,000
TALIESIN: And I'm very impressed. You're going to
have to draw everything. You're going to have to

763
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,054
draw everything. It's very important.

764
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:29,634
LIAM: They looked like Slendermen.

765
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:31,362
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

766
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:33,041
LAURA: Very tall and slender.

767
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:37,243
SAM: They kept singing about a Technicolor
Dreamcoat.

768
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:38,987
(laughter)

769
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:40,354
TALIESIN: I have a book about that.

770
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,101
(laughter)

771
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:50,687
MATT: All right. So. Your adventure to finally
find the Theatre, complete. I believe that

772
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:53,588
concludes your immediate ventures. Percival.

773
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:57,567
TALIESIN: I had the least vacation-y of anybody's
vacation.

774
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:58,657
MATT: Of course you did.

775
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:05,219
TALIESIN: 'Cause I have technically been on
vacation for many, many years. I finally took the

776
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:10,631
mantle of responsibility for not necessarily-- I'm
not ruling Whitestone, that's not how it works,

777
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:13,248
but I did take on a lot of the civic
responsibility.

778
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,445
MATT: Yeah, you guys converted into the Chamber of
Whitestone.

779
00:47:16,445 --> 00:47:17,358
TALIESIN: Yes.

780
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,384
MATT: Which is less of a singular family ruling
and more of a small series of offices held by

781
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,114
Lords or Ladies.

782
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:30,551
TALIESIN: I hired someone to help run the-- my
workshop.

783
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:34,502
SAM: I was doing a lot of work.

784
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:37,165
(laughter)

785
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:38,742
SAM: Mornings at the bakery--

786
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:40,949
(laughter)

787
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:44,622
SAM: -- afternoons at the workshop, and then an
hour and a half every night enchanting it.

788
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:45,727
LAURA: Yeah.

789
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:46,897
TALIESIN: And then we drink.

790
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,923
SAM: Yeah.

791
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:51,661
LAURA: But didn't it feel good, Tary, to get your
hands dirty?

792
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:56,557
SAM: It did. I got this thing on my finger, I was
later told that that's what happens when you work

793
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:57,871
with your hands.

794
00:47:57,871 --> 00:47:59,339
(laughter)

795
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,216
SAM: It's a blister! Yeah.

796
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:03,167
TRAVIS: How awful.

797
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:13,438
TALIESIN: So, with the help, I had time to start
working on a few projects. I finally made a new

798
00:48:13,438 --> 00:48:15,699
pair of glasses. Well, I tried.

799
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,059
MATT: You tried.

800
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:18,766
TALIESIN: To make a new pair of glasses.

801
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:22,338
MATT: You rolled a one. And then you rolled a
two.

802
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:25,052
TALIESIN: And then I rolled again and tried to
make a new pair of glasses. And then I realized

803
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:32,125
it's very, very hard to make a pair of glasses
when you can't see what you're doing because you

804
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,206
don't have a pair of glasses.

805
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:35,660
SAM: Warby Parker.

806
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,101
TALIESIN: So then I actually called Tary and said,
please fix these for me. He made very, very nice

807
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:43,689
glasses. I think they have your name inscribed on
them, they're really gaudy.

808
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:47,605
SAM: Rose gold is the best.

809
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,955
TALIESIN: White gold. White gold. Please.

810
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:51,438
(laughter)

811
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:59,221
TALIESIN: It's got to match the outfit. I
automated the system for making shot and powder

812
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:07,285
for the castle. I created a royal guard that-- and
have been training an elite group of soldiers

813
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:14,786
specifically to guard the family and the house.
They were the Whitestone Musketeers until

814
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,605
Cassandra said that that was silly and so they
were called the Riflemen.

815
00:49:17,605 --> 00:49:19,244
MATT: Riflemen of Whitestone.

816
00:49:19,244 --> 00:49:21,549
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Riflemen of Whitestone.
(whispers) Musketeers.

817
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:23,355
(laughter)

818
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,657
MATT: "I'm sorry, Percy, but no."

819
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:29,347
TALIESIN: No. I get vetoed a lot, these days.

820
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:31,585
(laughter)

821
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:37,544
TALIESIN: I began modernizing the city. I have a
wonderful dream of turning Whitestone into a

822
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:43,495
shining beacon on the hill of what the future of
mankind could be. And the first order of business,

823
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:52,675
one of two big projects that we've started to
bring forth our reputation as this modern city, is

824
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:59,795
we've been running steam pipes from the depths
through the main streets so that the snow never

825
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:03,693
needs to be uncovered, so that the streets are
always clean, and a few of the major houses can be

826
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:06,013
heated this way during the heavy winters.

827
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:08,298
MATT: It's a heavy endeavor, it's going to take a
while to complete.

828
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:09,603
TALIESIN: It's not completed yet.

829
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:11,009
MATT: It's begun work.

830
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:16,260
TALIESIN: We're also trying to create some series
of illuminations at least within the main castle

831
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,727
in case the thing in the basement that we're still
working on ever turns on us and suddenly we are

832
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:31,144
un-magiced, which is a constant fear. I've
upgraded, with Taryon's help, we've upgraded

833
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:41,418
several of my inventions. I've had a proper sword
of my family crest made. I finally got the glove

834
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:50,099
more-or-less working. More working, honestly, but
I'll get into that later. I've been desperately

835
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,894
trying to get you to stop going out into the woods
to stop searching for that bloody thing.

836
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:57,729
LAURA: I've been a bit obsessed, I'm sorry.

837
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:01,802
TALIESIN: That covers quite a bit of it,
at this point.

838
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:05,488
MATT: Yeah. That's pretty much everything you've
got here.

839
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,398
TRAVIS: What'd you kill, in the year that you had
off?

840
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:10,551
SAM: Time.

841
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:16,153
TALIESIN: Time, and things in the woods, on
occasion. We go hunting. And I've also been

842
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:18,500
training men how to use their guns, so there's
been a bit of that.

843
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,793
TRAVIS: Boring.

844
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:20,999
MATT: All right.

845
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:24,016
LIAM: Did you catch a whiff of Galdrick out in
woods?

846
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:31,958
LAURA: I've seen a wolf, out and about, but he
seems to do his job well, and I'm not going to

847
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,378
stop him.

848
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:35,986
TALIESIN: Technically an honorary member of the
Grey Hunt, I'd say.

849
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:37,240
LAURA: Yes, quite.

850
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,671
MATT: All right. And Taryon.

851
00:51:39,671 --> 00:51:44,470
SAM: Well...

852
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:49,240
Taryon had a great year.

853
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,293
MATT: You're such a terrible person.

854
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:59,965
SAM: You've heard much of what he's done. Mainly
just building and working and working and

855
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:08,874
building. And in his spare time, he built and
worked on things for himself. Chief among them,

856
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:14,838
Doty! Doty 2.0, take this down.

857
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:16,132
MATT: "Tary."

858
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,181
SAM: Yes, see?

859
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:18,868
TRAVIS: Oh he fucking talks!

860
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:24,702
SAM: A little bit. Doty, how handsome am I?

861
00:52:24,702 --> 00:52:25,694
MATT: "Tary."

862
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:35,559
SAM: I heard "very". And Doty, what do you say
when it's windy outside?

863
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,419
MATT: "Tary."

864
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:44,550
SAM: It's airy. Right? That's what I heard. Oh no,
boo!

865
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,055
MATT: "Tary?"

866
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:52,444
SAM: Yeah, it is scary. He says a lot of things.
It depends on the context, you have to sort of

867
00:52:52,444 --> 00:53:02,756
figure out what he's saying. But he can say that,
he can say one word. It took a lot of money to do

868
00:53:02,824 --> 00:53:12,237
that, but it was worth it. He's also got a couple
of upgrades. He's got a waterproof slot for the

869
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:15,855
book inside of him so he can store my book.

870
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:19,105
MATT: The door itself is also a crest.

871
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:27,230
SAM: Yes, the crest of Vox Machina, right on his
chest, emblazoned there. His arm works a little

872
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:34,659
differently, his right arm, which we might see in
some sort of competition at some point. And his

873
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:40,897
left arm, thanks to Percival Fredrickstein von
Mussel de something.

874
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:42,279
TALIESIN: Bless you.

875
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:46,246
SAM: He's got a little hole right here in his
hand, that--

876
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:48,849
LAURA: That you... never mind.

877
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:53,086
(laughter)

878
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:55,504
TRAVIS: That was amazing!

879
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,204
LIAM: Our hero!

880
00:53:57,204 --> 00:54:03,571
TALIESIN: You're gonna pay for that, oh my God, I
can feel the radiation.

881
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:08,256
TRAVIS: It can't be for anything else. Anything
else won't compare. Just change it.

882
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:10,265
LAURA: Just a little hole.

883
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:12,255
TRAVIS: Itty-bitty little hole.

884
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:14,043
LIAM: How wide is the hole?

885
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:17,989
SAM: It's got some girth.

886
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:21,110
TALIESIN: Well-machined.

887
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:28,504
SAM: But it can fire a shot, a bullet shot. I've
never used it before, but it can shoot something.

888
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:29,853
TALIESIN: It can.

889
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,136
MATT: Once, and then takes a short rest to
reload.

890
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:41,254
SAM: Yep. And I think that's the major
improvements to Doty, other than the speaking and

891
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:43,452
the other stuff. Let's see, what else did I do?

892
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:45,553
LIAM: You told me one other thing. Did that get
jettisoned?

893
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:49,572
SAM: Oh, I also bought him-- I bought a lot of
stuff. I'm almost out of money, guys.

894
00:54:49,572 --> 00:54:50,657
TRAVIS: What?

895
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:52,160
LAURA: But you're making some, with the bakery.

896
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,608
SAM: That is not what I would call money.

897
00:54:54,608 --> 00:54:59,209
TALIESIN: You are technically a civil servant as
well, so you're making money there.

898
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:04,614
SAM: No, I'm talking about actual money that you
can buy things with. I bought

899
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:06,300
Doty a pair of boots.

900
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,865
MATT: Yep.

901
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:09,350
SAM: The Boots of--

902
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,884
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a lot of cards!

903
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:14,305
SAM: Yeah, I bought a lot of stuff. The Boots of
Elvenkind, so he's a little more stealthy when we

904
00:55:14,305 --> 00:55:15,461
go around.

905
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:17,139
LAURA: Don't you have those, too?

906
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:20,957
SAM: I also tinkered with my armor, or did I have
it tinkered on?

907
00:55:20,957 --> 00:55:28,417
MATT: You don't know how to make armor, so you
had the armor commissioned, using the remains of

908
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:32,473
Vorugal's hide. No, sorry, you have Vorugal-- the
remains of Umbrasyl's hide.

909
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:38,386
SAM: Yes, so I have breastplate armor that has
black dragon scales embedded in it, right?

910
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:39,559
MATT: Yes.

911
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:46,113
SAM: And it gives me a little more protection
against acid, and it also looks cool. A little

912
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:53,489
darker flair. And so I could communicate with
them, I built myself a little earring-- it's a

913
00:55:53,489 --> 00:56:00,561
little different from yours, it dangles and it's
got a nice gem on the end, because if you're going

914
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:15,554
to wear it, at least look good. And also, in my
spare time at Vex's house, when she was asleep--

915
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:24,400
she's a snorer-- sometimes I would be awake and I
would examine her broom a bit and decided to make

916
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,791
myself one too.

917
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,061
(gasping)

918
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:30,491
LAURA: Sneaky sneak!

919
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,523
TRAVIS: You made a broom?

920
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,775
LAURA: You know we have a fucking flying carpet?

921
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:37,098
SAM: Now we have two brooms. We can leave those
fuckers in the dust!

922
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:38,775
LAURA: That's pretty fucking cool.

923
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:43,355
(laughter)

924
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:45,940
TRAVIS: You really have no money left.

925
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:52,073
SAM: I am out of money. I have a teeny bit left.
But I also bought some other things.

926
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:54,836
TALIESIN: He's now going to become Whitestone's
FedEx though.

927
00:56:54,836 --> 00:56:57,670
LIAM: Are we all getting any prezzies?

928
00:56:57,788 --> 00:57:00,751
SAM: Are you back? You were gone?

929
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,445
MATT: All right, is that the end of that?

930
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:05,010
SAM: And I wrote. A lot.

931
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:05,979
MATT: Yes.

932
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:09,166
SAM: Just a lot of writing, and I'm probably
halfway through that book by now.

933
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:16,115
MATT: Awesome. All right. So as the months go by
and you all have your individual adventures, as

934
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:21,578
you converse and talk amongst yourselves, the date
of Winter's Crest begins to creep up. Now,

935
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:29,463
Winter's Crest is a day that's really only
celebrated in Tal'Dorei proper-- occasionally by

936
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:33,923
people in other places who migrated away from
Tal'Dorei, but the event that it's based around,

937
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:38,824
Eravon the Ice Lord, was specific to Tal'Dorei.
It's not celebrated everywhere in the world.

938
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:46,193
However, it is coming up, and you all decided to
celebrate your Winter's Crest festival this year,

939
00:57:46,193 --> 00:57:53,356
not in Tal'Dorei. You all instead made your way
towards the Bay of Gifts, in Marquet.

940
00:57:53,356 --> 00:57:57,572
MARISHA: Tropical vacation.

941
00:57:57,572 --> 00:57:59,940
MATT: Now, how are you guys getting there? Are you
taking a leisurely boat trip?

942
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,525
Are you going via trees?

943
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:02,871
TALIESIN: Well, we were leaving from Whitestone,
right?

944
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:04,970
LAURA: We were leaving from Whitestone because
we'd all gathered there for--

945
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,911
MATT: Oh, that's right, before you even left
there, you--

946
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:14,086
TALIESIN: That's right, as you were saying, it is
based on that festival, and of course Whitestone

947
00:58:14,086 --> 00:58:17,146
has its own paganistic rituals dating back many,
many years.

948
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:18,865
LIAM: I've read about them.

949
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:20,506
TALIESIN: Yes, you have now.

950
00:58:20,506 --> 00:58:23,856
LIAM: And I will start telling you about it.

951
00:58:23,856 --> 00:58:31,415
TALIESIN: I've so many text files to send you, my
word. So usually at this time, the winter

952
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:40,122
solstice, especially when we have a new Master or
Mistress of the Grey Hunt, there's usually a

953
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:45,768
celebration or a ball, and they're not every
single winter's festival, but it does happen, but

954
00:58:45,768 --> 00:58:52,720
since this was the first, we decided to have a fancy
party. She was bestowed with her crest and

955
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,838
otherwise and we all dressed up.

956
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:56,817
MARISHA: Did she get a dope crown?

957
00:58:56,817 --> 00:59:03,174
TALIESIN: You don't get a crown, you get a cloak-y
thing with a medallion piece.

958
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:05,296
MARISHA: Mantle sisters!

959
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:11,628
TALIESIN: You don't really have to wear it, it's
just something you get to own. But I also had a

960
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:14,307
piece of jewelry commissioned for everybody.

961
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:16,714
SAM: I've already got one.

962
00:59:16,714 --> 00:59:20,153
MATT: Keyleth helped you with this one
specifically.

963
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:26,088
TALIESIN: This one specifically, because I had to
go find our friend in the Fire Plane.

964
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:28,142
MATT: Senokir, yeah.

965
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:29,790
MARISHA: That's right, that's right.

966
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,465
MATT: "Very happy to help you."

967
00:59:32,465 --> 00:59:36,524
MARISHA: And we inform him that we buried his
wife's ashes.

968
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:39,914
MATT: "And I greatly appreciated you being so
honorable."

969
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:41,417
MARISHA: Yes, yes.

970
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:43,175
MATT: "Thank you."

971
00:59:43,175 --> 00:59:44,991
MARISHA: Okay, Percy, do your thing.

972
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:47,155
MATT: "What do you need from me?"

973
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:54,277
TALIESIN: I have this design, and this requires
some gemstones, and I have a limited amount of

974
00:59:54,277 --> 01:00:01,516
dragon scales from five dead dragons, and I was
curious if you could make a hero's crest that is

975
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:09,055
built around these five dragon scales, so that
everyone who helped to slay these dragons will

976
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:14,360
always have a token that proves that they were
there and they were one of them. And then I also

977
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,421
need one made without the dragon scales as well.

978
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:19,784
MATT: "Understood. Right away."

979
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,202
(laughter)

980
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,068
MATT: "You may leave now."

981
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:25,913
MARISHA: Do we come back in, like, two weeks?

982
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,333
TALIESIN: He'll call.

983
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,822
MARISHA: He'll call? Okay.

984
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:30,045
TALIESIN: Thank you.

985
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:31,412
MARISHA: Is this like a-- do we wait here?

986
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:32,216
TALIESIN: Goodbye!

987
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,477
MATT: "Goodbye."

988
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:35,063
LIAM: (AOL voice) Goodbye.

989
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:43,691
MATT: You receive word via imp, strangely enough.
Which sets you off for a moment, there. But you

990
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:48,233
are notified of their completion, and they're
delivered, finished, by this imp.

991
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:58,318
TALIESIN: They're beautiful, and at the ball, I
present all of these to you, and each is just a

992
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:08,446
bit individual. And they are crested in the gems
and in the dragon scales to give this color wheel

993
01:01:08,446 --> 01:01:10,463
of the red, the white, the blue, the green.

994
01:01:10,463 --> 01:01:11,961
LAURA: That's really beautiful.

995
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:17,566
TALIESIN: And there's one that doesn't have the
dragon scales, but it's just got this flourish

996
01:01:17,566 --> 01:01:22,704
around it, and we give it to Taryon because these
are meant to be built upon, as we will build upon

997
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:25,922
ours. Your accomplishments will be built upon
yours as well.

998
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:29,731
SAM: Thank you, Percy. That's very kind.

999
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,325
TRAVIS: Is there a pin?

1000
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:35,197
LIAM: Yeah, where are they best affixed to wear
our bling?

1001
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:36,556
TALIESIN: Anywhere you like.

1002
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:37,626
LIAM: Okay.

1003
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:38,964
TRAVIS: I don't wear a shirt, so.

1004
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:40,311
LAURA: Just right in your skin, Grog.

1005
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:41,317
LIAM: Nipple piercing.

1006
01:01:41,317 --> 01:01:43,170
GROG: Right in the nips?

1007
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:48,976
TALIESIN: All right. Or you could use it as your
piece clasp. You could put it on your-- you could

1008
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:50,977
put it anywhere. You could put it on your
gauntlet.

1009
01:01:50,977 --> 01:01:52,730
MARISHA: I use it to affix my mantle.

1010
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:54,700
MATT: There you go. Right in the center of the
mantle. Right there.

1011
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:01,634
TALIESIN: They're just something so that, in the
worst-case scenario, anyone will always know who

1012
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:07,057
we are, and we will know each other. It can't be
replicated. There's no one else who's made

1013
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:11,139
anything like this. There's not enough material to
make anything like this.

1014
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,572
LAURA: Ooh, I want to make mine my hairpiece.

1015
01:02:13,572 --> 01:02:19,141
TALIESIN: And we've got to figure out how to start
putting your accomplishments on yours soon.

1016
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:22,840
SAM: Well, I hope to have an accomplishment to add
to it.

1017
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:27,386
TALIESIN: You have several already. You defeated a
leviathan.

1018
01:02:27,386 --> 01:02:31,343
SAM: Sure. I killed a marid, right?

1019
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:35,772
MARISHA: You helped me unify the world, globally.

1020
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:37,385
SAM: I mean, go on.

1021
01:02:37,385 --> 01:02:40,451
LAURA: You're a world-class enchanter.

1022
01:02:40,451 --> 01:02:41,904
SAM: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.

1023
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:44,353
TALIESIN: Think of it much like your book.

1024
01:02:44,353 --> 01:02:46,708
SAM: Pike, what do you like about me?

1025
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:51,557
ASHLEY: You are so great at baking.

1026
01:02:51,557 --> 01:02:54,168
SAM: My profiteroles are really good.

1027
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:56,376
TRAVIS: Profiteroles?

1028
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:58,996
ASHLEY: What did we name the profiteroles again?

1029
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:07,271
SAM: I don't think we had a name for them.
Profite-roll for initiative?

1030
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:09,582
LIAM: Profiterolos!

1031
01:03:09,582 --> 01:03:10,957
TALIESIN: Profiterolos!

1032
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:18,349
LAURA: Oh, that's profiterolos!

1033
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:20,703
LIAM: You're fun to fucking drink with.

1034
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:21,852
SAM: Thank you.

1035
01:03:21,852 --> 01:03:23,089
TRAVIS: Your money.

1036
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:24,856
SAM: Well, thank you.

1037
01:03:24,856 --> 01:03:26,472
ASHLEY: Your hair is lovely.

1038
01:03:26,472 --> 01:03:27,661
SAM: It is, isn't it?

1039
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:28,962
LAURA: It's very shiny.

1040
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:31,216
ASHLEY: You're kind. You're very giving.

1041
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:36,350
SAM: All right, all right. Now I'm embarrassed.
But thank you. Thank you. Doty, you got all that?

1042
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,683
MATT: "Tary."

1043
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:39,170
(laughter)

1044
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,520
TRAVIS: Jesus. No!

1045
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,167
(laughter)

1046
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:48,736
TALIESIN: So we just have a wonderful evening
where we eat too much, we drink too much, we dance

1047
01:03:48,736 --> 01:03:50,287
and we all look fabulous.

1048
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:51,626
LAURA: Fabulous.

1049
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:57,042
TRAVIS: I'm only wearing the pointy helmet,
Percy's ascot, and his glasses.

1050
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,559
MATT: And that's it.

1051
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,478
LAURA: No pants?

1052
01:03:59,478 --> 01:04:01,142
TRAVIS: I mean, I always have pants on.

1053
01:04:01,142 --> 01:04:02,011
LAURA: Okay.

1054
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:03,152
MATT: Not always.

1055
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:09,238
LIAM: Also, I am not always wearing the Raven
Queen's armor. I'm wearing some of Percival's

1056
01:04:09,238 --> 01:04:17,633
loaner cast-of-Hamilton clothing right now. I, on
the break, built a trapped box to slide under the

1057
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:20,402
bed so that I can let my skin breathe at night.

1058
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:22,942
LAURA: He doesn't smell as moldy after a year.

1059
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,758
LIAM: I smell lovely.

1060
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:31,372
MARISHA: You know, I've crafted him some oils with
some herbs. He's good. I helped him manscape a

1061
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,896
bit, it's good.

1062
01:04:33,896 --> 01:04:35,761
LIAM: Barely any hair on this body.

1063
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:37,333
(laughter)

1064
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:46,440
MATT: Oh! All right, and as you guys-- the ball is
complete, you've all gathered. Your hangovers have

1065
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,123
faded. You all begin your trek toward the Bay of
Gifts.

1066
01:04:50,123 --> 01:04:51,706
TALIESIN: Yes!

1067
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:54,304
MARISHA: Wait, are we sailing or are we bamfing?

1068
01:04:54,304 --> 01:04:56,004
MATT: That's up to you guys.

1069
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:58,294
TALIESIN: I'd like to sail. I need a vacation.

1070
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,925
TRAVIS: (sings) Sailing.

1071
01:04:59,925 --> 01:05:03,363
TRAVIS, SAM AND MATT: (sing) Takes me away, to
where I've always---

1072
01:05:03,363 --> 01:05:05,589
LIAM: A little nostalgia in that for you, yeah?

1073
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:06,661
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1074
01:05:06,661 --> 01:05:07,780
LAURA: That's right.

1075
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,014
ASHLEY: Because I've sailed there before.

1076
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:10,376
MARISHA: And we didn't go sailing with Pike.

1077
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:12,062
TALIESIN: Teach us some sailing songs. It will be
fun.

1078
01:05:12,062 --> 01:05:13,155
ASHLEY: I'll teach you the ropes.

1079
01:05:13,155 --> 01:05:14,930
(laughter)

1080
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:16,130
MATT: Bah-derr.

1081
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,389
LIAM: And show us all the best gifs.

1082
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:19,572
ASHLEY: Okay.

1083
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:21,244
(laughter)

1084
01:05:21,244 --> 01:05:22,834
ASHLEY: I'll show you all the best jifs.

1085
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:24,875
LIAM: That's okay too. That's okay too.

1086
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,949
ASHLEY: Okay, just kidding. I don't say that.

1087
01:05:26,949 --> 01:05:33,268
MATT: I don't know what those are. All right, so
you make your way to Emon, then you charter a ship

1088
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:43,689
across the Ozmit Sea and make your way to the
continent of Marquet. On the northeast base of the

1089
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:48,957
Aggrad Mountains of Marquet, which consume a
sizable portion of the continent's north shore,

1090
01:05:48,957 --> 01:05:54,817
there before you stands, as it comes across the
horizon, a brilliant crescent-shaped bay of white

1091
01:05:54,817 --> 01:06:00,928
sands, glittering clear turquoise-colored waters,
and the grandiose port city of Shamal.

1092
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:02,486
LAURA: (sings) Shamal.

1093
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:05,891
(laughter)

1094
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:06,967
LAURA: Sorry.

1095
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,669
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

1096
01:06:08,669 --> 01:06:12,198
TALIESIN: God damn it.

1097
01:06:12,198 --> 01:06:13,366
ASHLEY: Oh, man.

1098
01:06:13,366 --> 01:06:18,809
MATT: Hundreds of ships fill the bay, from small
fishing vessels to massive cargo ships, bringing

1099
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:23,106
an ever-flowing mixture of cultures, goods, and
characters from across Exandria to its sunny

1100
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:28,690
location. Now, while back home Winter's Crest
brings seasonal rain and snow, here in the Bay of

1101
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:34,056
Gifts the sky is clear, the water is warm, and the
sun is ever-shining throughout the day. The

1102
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:38,472
streets of the city are draped in white and gold
silks, affixed and framing crossways and street

1103
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:43,726
corners between torch posts and buildings. The
distant sound of waves and seagulls cawing seems

1104
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:49,577
to envelop the city at all hours, occasionally
stemmed by the sounds of localized musicians. So

1105
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:55,995
as you arrived here about midday or so, you take
in the nice salty air into your lungs. You have

1106
01:06:55,995 --> 01:07:00,367
your belongings, your sacks at your side, the city
is bustling. What do you want to do with your

1107
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:01,578
vacation?

1108
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:04,781
LAURA: Oh. What do we do with a vacation?

1109
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:07,803
TRAVIS: Straight to the house of lady fav--

1110
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:12,876
(laughter)

1111
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:15,211
TALIESIN: I don't think I've ever done this
before. I'm not entirely sure.

1112
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:19,797
LAURA: I think we're supposed to just hang out and
lay down in a hut and hang out on the beach.

1113
01:07:19,797 --> 01:07:21,731
SAM: We need a place to stay. Right?

1114
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:23,050
LAURA: Well, yes.

1115
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:25,931
SAM: Preferably a fancy location.

1116
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:27,479
LIAM: As close to the beach as possible.

1117
01:07:27,479 --> 01:07:29,492
TALIESIN: Oh my God, you've done this before,
haven't you?

1118
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:34,082
SAM: We used to summer in warmer climes. That's
right. And--

1119
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:35,914
TALIESIN: We've never needed you more.

1120
01:07:35,914 --> 01:07:37,235
(laughter)

1121
01:07:37,235 --> 01:07:39,440
SAM: Well, we should get some cabanas.

1122
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,837
(gasping)

1123
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:41,928
LAURA: Yes!

1124
01:07:41,928 --> 01:07:43,185
TALIESIN: I don't know what that is!

1125
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:48,900
SAM: And some people to wait on us. And we
should-- Preferably near water. Swimmable water.

1126
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,675
And we just relax and tan, and sip mojitos.
(laughs)

1127
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:56,008
(laughter)

1128
01:07:56,008 --> 01:07:58,392
MARISHA: Do you have, like, a racial advantage to
find a place like this?

1129
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:01,541
SAM: (laughs) Vacations are my favored terrain.

1130
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:05,714
(laughter)

1131
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,794
MARISHA: Teach us your upper-white-male ways!

1132
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:11,159
TALIESIN: The blood is blue.

1133
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:12,640
(laughter)

1134
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,584
SAM: I will certainly be of help. I'm afraid I
can't pay for us this vacation.

1135
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:20,106
TALIESIN: No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

1136
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:22,278
LAURA: This is Vox Machina's vacation.

1137
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:23,344
SAM: All right.

1138
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:25,607
TALIESIN: This is a group vacation. This is what
this is now.

1139
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:30,976
SAM: Well, let's find a resort of some sort. Or a
relaxing spa! Or a---

1140
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,685
TRAVIS: Some sandals.

1141
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:34,278
SAM: (laughs) Yeah, sure.

1142
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:38,734
MATT: (laughs) All right. So who's helming this
journey here? This search for--

1143
01:08:38,734 --> 01:08:40,370
LAURA: I'll helm.

1144
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,118
MATT: All right, make an investigation check.

1145
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,076
LAURA: Okay.

1146
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:44,213
SAM: I will help her.

1147
01:08:44,213 --> 01:08:45,176
LAURA: Yeah.

1148
01:08:45,176 --> 01:08:48,018
MATT: All right. If you're helping her, that's
advantage for her on it, then.

1149
01:08:48,018 --> 01:08:50,340
LAURA: Oh, ah!

1150
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,726
LIAM: Oh my gosh!

1151
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:54,481
LAURA: Okay, well-- It doesn't matter, I rolled
it.

1152
01:08:54,552 --> 01:08:56,392
TALIESIN: The one that got away.

1153
01:08:56,392 --> 01:08:58,271
LAURA: (hums) 17.

1154
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:05,871
MATT: 17. Okay. Roughly 20 or so gold later, you
find the party affixed with the finest of

1155
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,925
Marquesian sandals. (laughs)

1156
01:09:07,925 --> 01:09:09,886
(laughter)

1157
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:17,607
MATT: And come upon a place that was referred to
you as Dalen's closet. D-A-L-E-N's Closet. Which

1158
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:23,244
doesn't sound majestic, but when you were
eventually led to where it resides-- the best way

1159
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:31,960
I can describe it? It's a field of beautiful
hammocks affixed to various tropical trees and

1160
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,092
structures that are built out of driftwood.

1161
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:35,158
MARISHA: Oh my God.

1162
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:40,328
MATT: Right next to a brilliant bright white
sandstone structure that appears to be the actual

1163
01:09:40,328 --> 01:09:50,684
resort, if you will. It's a wide tavern,
single-story. But well-staffed, and not terribly

1164
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:55,748
busy. But it seems to be very nice, and akin to
some of the best places you've been to in your

1165
01:09:55,748 --> 01:09:58,992
previous excursions on vacation.

1166
01:09:58,992 --> 01:10:00,526
SAM: All right!

1167
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:08,841
MATT: So as you arrive there, you are met with a
male, dark-skinned, somewhat balding Marquesian

1168
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:15,324
halfling at the front desk who smiles as you
approach. He puts out his hands. "Welcome,

1169
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:19,366
"friends! You are here for a-- I imagine to stay
within The Closet?"

1170
01:10:19,419 --> 01:10:20,882
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Yes.

1171
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:25,434
MATT: "Ah, I am Guath, and this is for all of you?
I will have to charge

1172
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,117
"for your friend, I am sorry."

1173
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:30,432
SAM: Oh, well, he's not really a person, but--

1174
01:10:30,432 --> 01:10:35,759
MATT: "You're lucky I'm not charging twice! He's a
very big guy. That goes for that one as well."

1175
01:10:35,759 --> 01:10:37,497
SAM: He doesn't eat. So--

1176
01:10:37,497 --> 01:10:39,664
MATT: "Then he won't order food! But he's going to
sleep somewhere, yes?"

1177
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:42,002
LAURA, TALIESIN and SAM: He doesn't sleep.

1178
01:10:42,002 --> 01:10:44,022
MATT: "Well then, is he okay with staying out on
the beach?"

1179
01:10:44,022 --> 01:10:45,857
SAM: Doty? Are you okay with staying on the
beach?

1180
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:47,493
MATT: "Tary?"

1181
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,898
SAM: He said very.

1182
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:50,434
(laughter)

1183
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:57,061
MATT: "Okay, very well. So that would be
ba-da-da-- seven and a half? Seven, we'll go with

1184
01:10:57,118 --> 01:10:59,670
"seven. How long do you plan to stay?"

1185
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,716
LIAM: A couple of weeks?

1186
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,847
LAURA: A couple of weeks, a week? Something like
that.

1187
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:04,901
SAM: Ten days? Ten days?

1188
01:11:04,901 --> 01:11:06,385
LAURA: Ten days is really good.

1189
01:11:06,385 --> 01:11:08,193
MATT: "Ten days?"

1190
01:11:08,193 --> 01:11:09,954
SAM: We'll get bored after eight or nine.

1191
01:11:09,954 --> 01:11:11,306
MARISHA: Yeah, we might hop around.

1192
01:11:11,306 --> 01:11:12,607
LIAM: We should be so lucky.

1193
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:15,507
LAURA: I know what he's about to do to me right
now. I know what Matt's going to do.

1194
01:11:15,634 --> 01:11:17,799
MATT: "Let me see here." And he brings up this
small abacus and starts doing math really quickly

1195
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:25,309
on the side you see. "Nine days, you said?"

1196
01:11:25,309 --> 01:11:27,303
LAURA: Ten days.

1197
01:11:27,303 --> 01:11:36,699
MATT: "Ten days, all right. We'll put that at an
even-- with discount for friendships, 1500 gold

1198
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:38,320
"for the entire stay."

1199
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,247
LAURA: Oh! Well, seems-- and food is included, I'm
assuming.

1200
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:43,960
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, no. I'm sorry."

1201
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,067
LAURA: Where would we go eat?

1202
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:50,411
MATT: "Well, we have a restaurant within as well,
and there are plenty of places to eat around the

1203
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:53,715
"way. We are happy to bring it to your quarters,
but there is a surcharge for it, of course."

1204
01:11:53,715 --> 01:11:55,490
LIAM: Are you going to do the thing?

1205
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,783
LAURA: Do what thing, darling?

1206
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:57,797
LIAM: Your thing.

1207
01:11:57,797 --> 01:11:58,966
ASHLEY: Do you have any specials?

1208
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,097
LIAM: The thing you do.

1209
01:12:00,097 --> 01:12:01,191
(laughter)

1210
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,556
MARISHA: AAA discounts?

1211
01:12:02,556 --> 01:12:03,669
(laughter)

1212
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:04,685
TALIESIN: Rotary club.

1213
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:07,326
ASHLEY: AAA discounts, tenth night free
situation?

1214
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:08,799
LAURA: Friends of J'mon Sa Ord.

1215
01:12:08,799 --> 01:12:16,539
MATT: "Uh. We do not run discounts here,
unfortunately. We are a very premier establishment

1216
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:17,964
"here in the Bay of Gifts."

1217
01:12:17,964 --> 01:12:19,528
LAURA: Of course.

1218
01:12:19,528 --> 01:12:22,594
MATT: "So do you wish to stay or not?"

1219
01:12:22,594 --> 01:12:24,207
LAURA: Well, 1500 gold it is.

1220
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:25,514
TRAVIS: We wish to stay.

1221
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:26,744
MARISHA: That's fair.

1222
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:27,700
TALIESIN: I think we wish to stay. I think--

1223
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,678
MARISHA: We never spend money on ourselves.

1224
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,413
SAM: Yeah, we never treat ourselves.

1225
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:33,809
LIAM: Yeah. Ultimately our time is worth far more
than our money, so-- let's just go with that.

1226
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,977
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

1227
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:40,389
MATT: "All right! Fantastic!" So you pay off the
1500. Mark that off on the party gold. You are

1228
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,452
given some keys--

1229
01:12:41,452 --> 01:12:43,284
ASHLEY: How about some free drinks?

1230
01:12:43,284 --> 01:12:44,678
MATT: (laughs) Make a persuasion check.

1231
01:12:44,678 --> 01:12:46,118
(laughter)

1232
01:12:46,118 --> 01:12:47,229
TALIESIN: Wow!

1233
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,942
TRAVIS: Getting after it! Wasting no time.

1234
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:53,359
MATT: This is training for your vacation next
week.

1235
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,211
ASHLEY: I used to come here on a ship and we used
to bring you guys a lot

1236
01:12:56,211 --> 01:13:00,876
of supplies, so, you know.

1237
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,270
(gasping)

1238
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,617
TALIESIN: Natural number.

1239
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:06,998
TRAVIS: Wow.

1240
01:13:06,998 --> 01:13:08,726
ASHLEY: 31.

1241
01:13:08,726 --> 01:13:09,968
ALL: Ooh!

1242
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,607
MATT: What is your persuasion?

1243
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:13,112
ASHLEY: It's 12.

1244
01:13:13,112 --> 01:13:14,340
SAM: It is?

1245
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,435
LAURA: Oh shit.

1246
01:13:15,435 --> 01:13:16,562
SAM: Pike!

1247
01:13:16,562 --> 01:13:18,359
TRAVIS: Why have we not had fucking Pike do
things?

1248
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:19,550
SAM: No shit!

1249
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,809
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

1250
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:25,529
ASHLEY: Maybe, how about-- If we don't get free
food, what about--

1251
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:32,956
MATT: As you're telling him this he goes, "Well,
I--" That's right, because you trained in

1252
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:35,421
persuasion as part of the skills feat. That's
right.

1253
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:38,383
LIAM: All right, all right! (laughs)

1254
01:13:38,383 --> 01:13:45,258
MATT: So your charisma is-- Sorry, just making
sure on the math on this one. Don't want to get

1255
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:47,823
lost. What's your charisma?

1256
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,721
ASHLEY: Two. 14.

1257
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:53,490
MATT: 14. Plus two. Plus-- So it would be plus
eight, unless you had something else to add under

1258
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:57,837
persuasion. Regardless, you rolled really high.
We'll go over the math later.

1259
01:13:57,837 --> 01:13:59,178
ASHLEY: Okay.

1260
01:13:59,178 --> 01:14:09,942
MATT: "I don't recognize you, but we've had many
travelers and you seem--" He looks over the group

1261
01:14:09,942 --> 01:14:16,469
a bit, especially the large one. "Free drinks. Why
not? I'd be happy to give you this."

1262
01:14:16,469 --> 01:14:18,549
LAURA: All right, nice, Pike!

1263
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:21,650
MATT: He reaches behind the counter and brings out
a couple of these small wooden coins.

1264
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:22,800
ASHLEY: Tokens!

1265
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,497
MATT: He passes them out "All right, that is five,
six-- He doesn't drink, you said. So that is just

1266
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:28,829
"seven. There you go."

1267
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:29,938
ASHLEY: Thanks!

1268
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:32,062
SAM: We said he didn't eat. He drinks.

1269
01:14:32,062 --> 01:14:33,345
(laughter)

1270
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:38,697
MATT: "So seven for all of you! Enjoy your stay!
If you have any questions, requirements, issues,

1271
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:46,533
"or anything, anything at all, you let me know. We
can provide. Okay!" He gives you your keys, leads

1272
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:52,352
you to you guys'-- The rooms are clustered in
fours, like a little square. They are all adjacent

1273
01:14:52,352 --> 01:14:57,369
next to each other in groups of four, so there is
two sections you guys are given, in square

1274
01:14:57,369 --> 01:15:03,030
formation with small pathways, but all the
walkways, all the alleys between these all just

1275
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:07,586
lead right out onto the beach. There are no solid
walls on any of the hallways here, it's just the

1276
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:10,466
rooms that are closed off. Everything just goes--
you just step off into the sand.

1277
01:15:10,466 --> 01:15:13,794
LAURA: This is amazing. I'm already, I'm in love
with this place.

1278
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:16,822
LIAM: We don't need to go anywhere. This is it.

1279
01:15:16,822 --> 01:15:19,724
MATT: All right, so. Anything you guys wish to
accomplish specifically while you're here?

1280
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:22,020
LAURA: No, just get drunk and hang out on the
beach.

1281
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,183
LIAM: Yeah, I'm already peeling off my shirt.

1282
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:26,815
LAURA: Yeah! Roll for fucking putting on
swimsuits!

1283
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,332
MATT: (laughs) That's great!

1284
01:15:28,332 --> 01:15:31,462
SAM: I have a gift to give to Vax! I have a gift
to give.

1285
01:15:31,462 --> 01:15:32,523
LIAM: Oh yeah?

1286
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:34,205
SAM: 'Cause we're in the Bay of Gifts.

1287
01:15:34,205 --> 01:15:36,347
LIAM: I've got my shirt up around my arms. What's
up, buddy?

1288
01:15:36,347 --> 01:15:37,793
(laughter)

1289
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:42,795
SAM: You know, we haven't talked much over this
year since I've been helping your fucking sister.

1290
01:15:42,795 --> 01:15:44,682
LIAM: Well, my sister has locked you up, it's
true.

1291
01:15:44,682 --> 01:15:49,204
SAM: But, you know, I've talked to her a lot about
how you have this ongoing sort of

1292
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:51,474
teasing war with Grog.

1293
01:15:51,474 --> 01:15:53,147
LIAM: Oh yeah?

1294
01:15:53,147 --> 01:15:58,510
SAM: And I have acquired something for you to use
in this battle.

1295
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,936
LIAM: Do tell, motherfucker.

1296
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:03,152
TALIESIN: (gasps) No!

1297
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:05,243
SAM: Use it when the time is right.

1298
01:16:05,243 --> 01:16:08,822
TALIESIN: No! No, you are a sadistic bastard!

1299
01:16:08,822 --> 01:16:11,640
LIAM: Oh. My. Fucking. God!

1300
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,726
(laughter)

1301
01:16:12,726 --> 01:16:18,801
LIAM: Oh my fucking God! I pull him into the
tightest hug, and I give him a kiss on his

1302
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:19,889
forehead.

1303
01:16:19,889 --> 01:16:21,353
SAM: Oh, oh, oh! No! Okay.

1304
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:24,841
LIAM: You beautiful fuck! Slap! Let's go get in
the fucking water!

1305
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:26,499
And I run off towards the beach.

1306
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:29,913
TALIESIN: That is the darkest thing I've ever
seen. That is amazing.

1307
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:36,922
MATT: (laughter) I think I know what it is. All
right, so as you guys shed your armor, shed your

1308
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:41,911
weapons, put on your beach-faring clothing, you
all one-after-one begin to charge your way down to

1309
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:44,833
the white beach sands of the Bay of Gifts just
outside of the city itself.

1310
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,106
TRAVIS: Are there any pool aerobics?

1311
01:16:47,106 --> 01:16:48,902
(laughter)

1312
01:16:48,902 --> 01:16:51,696
MATT: (laughs) No, but you're welcome to start
one.

1313
01:16:51,696 --> 01:16:52,877
TRAVIS: No, I'll join the rest.

1314
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:55,161
LAURA: Grog! Grog! Lift me like Dirty Dancing!

1315
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:56,922
(laughter)

1316
01:16:56,922 --> 01:16:59,523
SAM: (sings) Ahh!

1317
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:01,659
MATT: Do you wait until she gets to the water
before you do that?

1318
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:02,679
TRAVIS: Nope!

1319
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:03,710
(laughter)

1320
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,059
MATT: You arc a good 15 feet before you go
face-down in the sand.

1321
01:17:06,059 --> 01:17:09,468
LAURA: Oh shit! You're supposed to hold on, Grog.
Never mind.

1322
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:11,012
TRAVIS: Oh, you said lift. I did it.

1323
01:17:11,012 --> 01:17:12,982
(laughter)

1324
01:17:12,982 --> 01:17:17,730
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth runs out and goes, who
wants to go scuba-diving?

1325
01:17:17,788 --> 01:17:19,398
ASHLEY: Ooh!

1326
01:17:19,398 --> 01:17:24,019
MARISHA: 'Cause I can Water Breathe us, and we can
go look at the coral reefs!

1327
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,326
LAURA: Yay! Let's do it!

1328
01:17:25,326 --> 01:17:26,608
LIAM: Let's do it! Let's do it!

1329
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:27,961
MARISHA: Okay!

1330
01:17:27,961 --> 01:17:28,764
MATT: All right.

1331
01:17:28,764 --> 01:17:29,802
MARISHA: We do that.

1332
01:17:29,802 --> 01:17:30,739
MATT: All right. So.

1333
01:17:30,739 --> 01:17:31,946
(laughter)

1334
01:17:31,946 --> 01:17:33,846
MARISHA: We do that at some point, throughout the
week.

1335
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:37,049
MATT: Through the elements of-- which by the way,
we're all discovering here now, all the various

1336
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:39,269
relaxation elements of magic in D&amp;D.

1337
01:17:39,269 --> 01:17:40,206
(laughter)

1338
01:17:40,206 --> 01:17:42,122
MATT: Which they don't go into in the Player's
Handbook as often.

1339
01:17:42,122 --> 01:17:43,358
LIAM: Oh yeah.

1340
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:47,190
MATT: (laughs) You guys manage to explore the
majority of-- over this journey, and multiple

1341
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:51,419
trips-- explore a lot of the underwater portion of
the Bay of Gifts, which includes a number of

1342
01:17:51,419 --> 01:17:57,782
wrecked ships, that have just been storms, this is
a very, very prominent bay.

1343
01:17:57,782 --> 01:17:59,495
MARISHA: It's like the Bermuda Triangle!

1344
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:04,430
MATT: You do run into other individuals that are
actually either scavengers or pearl-divers or

1345
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:09,928
people that deal with gathering kelp and various
other forms of plant life off the ground for

1346
01:18:10,005 --> 01:18:14,866
food or other purposes. It's a very thriving
ecosystem here. The people that live within this

1347
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:19,824
bay utilize everything in the vicinity. You
see that work here, it's quite fascinating, and

1348
01:18:19,878 --> 01:18:28,790
you see all walks of life. You all are pale as
fuck by comparison to the locals here, who live in

1349
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:30,304
the sun most of their life.

1350
01:18:30,304 --> 01:18:32,332
TRAVIS: Well, me especially.

1351
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:35,558
MATT: But everyone there is friendly. You're
little white-ass beacons underwater.

1352
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:37,652
LAURA: Do we see any mermaids?

1353
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:43,250
MATT: There are no mermaids in this bay that you
find. Sorry.

1354
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,397
LAURA: It's okay.

1355
01:18:44,397 --> 01:18:45,554
TALIESIN: Next vacation.

1356
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:50,885
MARISHA: I turn to Pike and Vex and go, hey! Hey!
Underwater tea party!

1357
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:56,620
TRAVIS: Nope. Not doing that shit. Not doing
that.

1358
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,202
(laughter)

1359
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,767
ASHLEY: Are you going to join?

1360
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,740
SAM: I'm still trying to pressurize.

1361
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,721
(laughter)

1362
01:19:04,721 --> 01:19:06,263
LAURA: I want to find pearls!

1363
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:08,032
TALIESIN: I'll go diving for pearls! Oh, yes!

1364
01:19:08,032 --> 01:19:11,855
MATT: All right. Each of you who wants to go
pearl-diving, make an investigation check.

1365
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:12,906
ASHLEY: I want to.

1366
01:19:12,906 --> 01:19:14,522
LIAM: I want to go!

1367
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:17,356
MARISHA: Can I look for shark's teeth? That's fun!
Can I do a nature check?

1368
01:19:17,356 --> 01:19:19,072
TRAVIS: I'm building a sand castle while they're
doing that.

1369
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:20,703
LAURA: Investigation?

1370
01:19:20,703 --> 01:19:22,635
SAM: I'll help you with that sand castle.

1371
01:19:22,635 --> 01:19:23,553
TRAVIS: Okay.

1372
01:19:23,553 --> 01:19:24,513
LIAM: 26!

1373
01:19:24,513 --> 01:19:25,736
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

1374
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:26,600
TALIESIN: 21!

1375
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,534
ASHLEY: I got a five. I definitely didn't find a
pearl.

1376
01:19:28,534 --> 01:19:29,485
MARISHA: 17.

1377
01:19:29,485 --> 01:19:30,439
TALIESIN: 21.

1378
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:31,566
LAURA: 22.

1379
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:35,340
MATT: You have no luck under the water, but you do
find a couple of shark teeth-- at least they look

1380
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,847
like shark teeth-- along the sands of the beach
that have washed up on the shore.

1381
01:19:37,847 --> 01:19:38,810
MARISHA: Cool.

1382
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,211
LIAM: 26. 26.

1383
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:41,782
MATT: You don't, what did you roll again?

1384
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:42,728
TALIESIN: 21.

1385
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:48,285
MATT: 21, okay. You do manage to find one pearl,
it's small but it's pretty. You manage to find a

1386
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:53,560
pretty decent pearl. You're not entirely certain--
make an intelligence check.

1387
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,832
LIAM: All right, I'm okay at that. Not today,
though.

1388
01:19:57,884 --> 01:20:00,057
LAURA: Are you feeling Lucky?

1389
01:20:00,057 --> 01:20:02,561
LIAM: I'm not burning Luck on this.

1390
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:05,728
MATT: You've burned it on lesser.

1391
01:20:05,728 --> 01:20:07,443
LAURA: I know, right?

1392
01:20:07,443 --> 01:20:09,704
LIAM: I'm not burning it on this. 13.

1393
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:13,489
MATT: 13, okay. You gather the pearl you gathered
is worth 150 gold.

1394
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:18,261
LIAM: Do you want this? I don't. You can have it.

1395
01:20:18,261 --> 01:20:20,099
MATT: There you go.

1396
01:20:20,099 --> 01:20:21,520
LAURA: I rolled 22, as well.

1397
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:28,593
MATT: You and Percival both find similar
pearls. Imperfect, maybe worth ten to 15 gold.

1398
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:31,688
LAURA: I don't want to sell it. I just want to
have it. It's pink.

1399
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:35,721
TALIESIN: I think I know how to pierce them.
Lovely.

1400
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:37,680
MATT: And you rolled a five?

1401
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,031
ASHLEY: I rolled a five. I found a boob.

1402
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:43,732
MATT: You found a sea cucumber.

1403
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:44,956
ASHLEY: Oh.

1404
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:50,875
TALIESIN: It's the sea hairs that squirt the ink?

1405
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:55,106
MATT: Not that type. It doesn't seem to have any
sort of defense mechanism. It sits there sadly in

1406
01:20:55,106 --> 01:20:56,202
her grasp.

1407
01:20:56,202 --> 01:21:00,527
LIAM: By the way, I should probably toss out,
because we probably haven't all been half-naked

1408
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:06,606
together-- you know this, some of you have, but
not all of us together-- I still have this big

1409
01:21:06,606 --> 01:21:10,054
mark in the middle of my chest. This black, veiny
thing.

1410
01:21:10,054 --> 01:21:16,765
MATT: It's not like a pulsing tumor, or anything.
It's a dark spot that looks like a bruise that

1411
01:21:16,765 --> 01:21:18,047
never quite went away.

1412
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,639
LIAM: FYI.

1413
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:21,655
MARISHA: Tattoo's looking good, though.

1414
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:26,952
TRAVIS: Tary, do you know what I hear they do on
beaches?

1415
01:21:26,952 --> 01:21:30,106
You bury someone up to their head in sand.

1416
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:32,052
SAM: Do you want me to bury you?

1417
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:39,856
TRAVIS: No, I thought we could bury you. Hold on.
And I start doggy digging between my feet. I go

1418
01:21:39,856 --> 01:21:41,324
into a Rage.

1419
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:43,646
TALIESIN: You could walk away right now. He'll
never know.

1420
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:46,824
TRAVIS: Big hole right there.

1421
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:50,840
MATT: What you don't notice is another traveling
couple that's lying on the beach about 15 to 20

1422
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,511
feet away are now completely buried in sand with
their drinks.

1423
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:58,440
TRAVIS: I end my Rage. Get in.

1424
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,045
SAM: All right, sure. We're friends.

1425
01:22:02,045 --> 01:22:03,687
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally friends.

1426
01:22:03,687 --> 01:22:06,023
SAM: All right. I'll step into the gigantic hole.

1427
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:09,630
MATT: You step in. Doty watches you get inside,
not really having an opinion on this.

1428
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,767
SAM: Sure.

1429
01:22:10,767 --> 01:22:13,135
TRAVIS: Why didn't you pay for our rooms with all
your money?

1430
01:22:13,135 --> 01:22:14,730
SAM: I've spent a lot of money.

1431
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,596
TRAVIS: How much?

1432
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:18,764
SAM: A lot.

1433
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:21,490
TRAVIS: How much do you have left?

1434
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:22,730
SAM: Not a lot.

1435
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,251
TRAVIS: I start filling up the hole.

1436
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:30,122
(laughter)

1437
01:22:30,122 --> 01:22:36,338
TRAVIS: I stop. Just so his arms are out, like
that.

1438
01:22:36,338 --> 01:22:43,320
SAM: Oh, this is fun. I should have taken my armor
off first. It's chafing me.

1439
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,516
MATT: All of you guys are beach-dressed except for
Tary!

1440
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:49,985
SAM: I thought this was a formal trip.

1441
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:58,144
MATT: Sand's gotten all in the metal joints and
the inside of the armor.

1442
01:22:58,144 --> 01:23:00,822
MARISHA: You know salt water is bad for the armor,
right?

1443
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:02,618
ASHLEY: You should go change.

1444
01:23:02,618 --> 01:23:03,734
MARISHA: You should.

1445
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:07,650
SAM: Doty, lift me up, please.

1446
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:12,671
MATT: "Taryon." Puts you down.

1447
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:14,073
LIAM: He just evolved.

1448
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,835
LAURA: Yeah, I know. I feel like he said Taryon.

1449
01:23:15,835 --> 01:23:18,394
MATT: Tary. It should have been Tary. Good catch.

1450
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:21,329
SAM: Undress me.

1451
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:31,445
MATT: He pulls off the breastplate, starts taking
off the armor pieces. You are now currently down

1452
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:32,478
to your skivvies.

1453
01:23:32,478 --> 01:23:33,455
SAM: Great.

1454
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:35,121
TRAVIS: Do you want to build a castle?

1455
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:36,798
SAM: Let's build the best castle ever.

1456
01:23:36,798 --> 01:23:39,143
TRAVIS: Fucking A, man. Do you know how to do
that?

1457
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:42,452
SAM: Do I know how to do that?

1458
01:23:42,452 --> 01:23:44,776
MATT: Are you trained in sand castle building?

1459
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:46,274
SAM: I am a tinkerer.

1460
01:23:46,274 --> 01:23:51,381
MATT: Yeah, and some of those tools may come in
handy. You know what I'm going to do on this?

1461
01:23:51,381 --> 01:23:52,776
SAM: Sand castle rolls.

1462
01:23:52,776 --> 01:23:54,836
MATT: Yeah, we're making rolls for sand castles.

1463
01:23:54,836 --> 01:23:55,790
TRAVIS: No shit?

1464
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:57,096
(laughter)

1465
01:23:57,096 --> 01:24:03,996
MATT: For this, we'll have a skill test for you,
because you are a brute strength individual. This

1466
01:24:03,996 --> 01:24:05,554
is going to be a dexterity check.

1467
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:06,619
TRAVIS: Okay.

1468
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:08,145
MATT: And you're following his plan.

1469
01:24:08,145 --> 01:24:14,256
SAM: I'm going to go to my history knowledge and
try to base it on one of the famous castles from

1470
01:24:14,256 --> 01:24:17,432
my youth, of my land.

1471
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:20,713
MATT: All right, from the Dwendalian Empire.

1472
01:24:20,713 --> 01:24:21,832
SAM: From the Truscan Empire.

1473
01:24:21,832 --> 01:24:26,520
MATT: Truscan area. I misspoke in an earlier
episode. The Dwendalian Empire of King Bertrand

1474
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,551
Dwendal.

1475
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:30,567
LIAM: Everybody looks over and Castle Ravenloft is
towering above the beach.

1476
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:34,696
MATT: Exactly, yeah. So, make your dexterity
check.

1477
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:38,117
TRAVIS: Four!

1478
01:24:38,117 --> 01:24:42,603
MATT: Taryon, go ahead and make your history
check.

1479
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:46,486
SAM: 16.

1480
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:53,607
MATT: Great. You get the structure built. You map
out the right scale structure of this castle, and

1481
01:24:53,607 --> 01:24:59,155
you get about three-quarters of the way through
before Grog (shifting sand).

1482
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:01,624
TRAVIS: What did you do?

1483
01:25:01,624 --> 01:25:09,429
SAM: (sighs) You know, maybe we should have-- you
know, let's just try one more time.

1484
01:25:09,429 --> 01:25:12,246
TRAVIS: Okay. What did we do wrong the first
time?

1485
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:17,073
SAM: Just be very careful, Grog. Because you were
backing up and I think you knocked into it a

1486
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:18,177
little bit.

1487
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:20,162
TRAVIS: You putting this on me?

1488
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:22,105
SAM: It was probably Doty.

1489
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:26,686
TRAVIS: Probably. Doty, go walk over there.

1490
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:29,408
MATT: "Tary." (impact sounds)

1491
01:25:29,408 --> 01:25:31,048
TRAVIS: Oh, he listens to me now?

1492
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:33,622
MATT: He walks over about ten feet.

1493
01:25:33,622 --> 01:25:36,276
SAM: All right, let's do one more try.

1494
01:25:36,276 --> 01:25:37,277
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1495
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:44,820
SAM: And really put some artistry into this. We
want a moat, we want defensive towers. I'm going

1496
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:49,425
to put a little alchemic fire in the middle of it,
so if anyone gets through the gates, they

1497
01:25:49,425 --> 01:25:50,472
explode.

1498
01:25:50,472 --> 01:25:51,806
TRAVIS: Wow. Dungeons?

1499
01:25:51,806 --> 01:25:52,954
SAM: Of course.

1500
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:54,573
TRAVIS: With alligators in the moat?

1501
01:25:54,573 --> 01:25:55,470
SAM: Yes.

1502
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,440
TRAVIS: Okay.

1503
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,809
SAM: Let's do it.

1504
01:25:57,809 --> 01:26:02,818
MATT: All right, now make an intelligence check to
lay out the design.

1505
01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:04,985
SAM: Just straight intelligence?

1506
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:06,471
MATT: Just straight intelligence.

1507
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:07,610
SAM: 13.

1508
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:11,975
MATT: That's still good. It's not a very hard DC.
You're structuring a sandcastle.

1509
01:26:11,975 --> 01:26:14,177
(laughter)

1510
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:19,857
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. Five.

1511
01:26:19,857 --> 01:26:21,977
LAURA: Oh no!

1512
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:24,464
MARISHA: You're with the worst sandcastle
partner.

1513
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:28,370
MATT: This one's bigger. This one's coming along
great. You're glad the first one fell over because

1514
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,250
now this is going to be much better.

1515
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:33,837
SAM: Yes, yeah, this is coming along great.

1516
01:26:33,837 --> 01:26:36,918
MATT: (sliding sand)

1517
01:26:36,918 --> 01:26:50,119
SAM: God fucking-- Grog! You stepped-- I mean, the
central structure held the whole thing! I'm

1518
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:53,370
getting a sunburn because we've been here for
so--

1519
01:26:53,370 --> 01:27:00,722
TRAVIS: I think that was my fault.

1520
01:27:00,722 --> 01:27:05,569
(laughter)

1521
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:11,624
SAM: (sighs) You know what? Just bury me again.
Just do that. Bury me again.

1522
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:18,999
LIAM: While that is happening, may I hide Taryon's
clothing?

1523
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:22,544
SAM: Aren't you skin-diving?

1524
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:27,421
LIAM: Time is loosey-goosey. Aren't we playing
Dungeons and Dragons here? It's up to him.

1525
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:32,104
MATT: Make a perception check.

1526
01:27:32,104 --> 01:27:34,975
LIAM: 23.

1527
01:27:34,975 --> 01:27:36,722
MATT: You see the opportunity.

1528
01:27:36,722 --> 01:27:37,785
LIAM: I'm getting him.

1529
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:39,352
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

1530
01:27:39,352 --> 01:27:41,049
LIAM: Sleight-of-hand check? Natural 20!

1531
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:50,186
MATT: A gentle pass by, choosing the right moment
in which Grog is involved in rage-burying and Taryon

1532
01:27:50,186 --> 01:27:59,593
has completely given up on his activities, you
manage to scoot through the sand, and moving your

1533
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:04,257
hand behind you to hide the trail, you drag his
armor off back towards the resort.

1534
01:28:04,257 --> 01:28:05,495
LIAM: Yoink.

1535
01:28:05,495 --> 01:28:11,452
MATT: All righty. As you've been buried now,
sufficiently--

1536
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,675
TRAVIS: All the way up to the head this time.

1537
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:16,383
MATT: Up to the neck. You feel the sunburn is
starting to kick in a bit.

1538
01:28:16,383 --> 01:28:21,021
SAM: (sighs) I need that helmet, Doty! My helm,
please.

1539
01:28:21,021 --> 01:28:24,098
TRAVIS: The giant reflective piece of metal?

1540
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,214
SAM: Yeah.

1541
01:28:25,214 --> 01:28:27,085
TRAVIS: You're going to cook in that thing.

1542
01:28:27,085 --> 01:28:29,575
MATT: "Tary."

1543
01:28:29,575 --> 01:28:32,355
SAM: What do you mean, "Tary?"

1544
01:28:32,355 --> 01:28:38,113
(laughter)

1545
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:45,412
SAM: Where did it go?

1546
01:28:45,412 --> 01:28:47,612
MATT: "Tary."

1547
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:53,614
SAM: Don't tell me "Tary!" Your number one job is
to take care of me, and your number two job is to

1548
01:28:53,614 --> 01:29:00,612
take care of my belongings! That stuff is worth
more than you!

1549
01:29:00,612 --> 01:29:04,666
MATT: "Tary."

1550
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:07,215
SAM: All right, just get me out of the hole.

1551
01:29:07,215 --> 01:29:08,885
MATT: (impact noise)

1552
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,780
LAURA: By your head.

1553
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,831
SAM: Ow!

1554
01:29:12,831 --> 01:29:20,688
TRAVIS: I hand him a seashell. I'm sorry.

1555
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:27,456
SAM: Let's go find my armor. I'm going to go look
around for it.

1556
01:29:27,456 --> 01:29:29,417
MATT: Make a survival check, because you're now
tracking.

1557
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:32,590
SAM: Survival? Ten.

1558
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:33,679
MATT: Ten.

1559
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:40,125
SAM: Oh, no. That's a four, so that's three. I'm a
negative one for survival. I thought it was 11.

1560
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:44,359
MATT: You spend the next hour asking from person
to person on these white sands.

1561
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:49,760
SAM: Excuse me, pardon me. Sorry to interrupt your
vacation. Have you seen a lot of armor and a big

1562
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,160
golden helmet? No? Okay.

1563
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,894
TALIESIN: Does everybody speak Common?

1564
01:29:54,894 --> 01:30:02,559
MATT: A lot of people do. This bay, in particular,
because this bay is a bastion of trade.

1565
01:30:02,559 --> 01:30:04,713
SAM: They're all German tourists.

1566
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:10,867
MATT: Exactly, yeah. It's a Swiss drop area. It's
great. But while everyone here, for the most part,

1567
01:30:10,945 --> 01:30:14,831
speaks Marquesian, a majority speaks some level of
Common.

1568
01:30:14,831 --> 01:30:19,370
TALIESIN: I was just curious if he was walking up
to people and they were staring, going "oh no",

1569
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:20,563
and walking on.

1570
01:30:20,563 --> 01:30:23,327
MATT: There were probably a couple, but they
probably understood him, they just didn't respond.

1571
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:28,133
Eventually, you find your way to the resort.
You're tired and you're sunburned and you're

1572
01:30:28,133 --> 01:30:31,856
exhausted. You walk out and see him in this
state.

1573
01:30:31,856 --> 01:30:37,951
LIAM: And by the way, I went to the front desk and
I asked which room Mr. de Rolo was staying in,

1574
01:30:37,951 --> 01:30:40,766
because I wanted to put some of his belongings
there, and I hid the armor

1575
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:43,766
in Percy and Vex's room.

1576
01:30:43,766 --> 01:30:46,470
TALIESIN: You'd better have been able to actually
convince them.

1577
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:50,154
MATT: Which is what I'm about to get to. Make a
deception check.

1578
01:30:50,154 --> 01:30:58,786
LIAM: Sure. Here's where the Luck is. Yeah.
Persuasion, you say?

1579
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,213
MATT: Deception.

1580
01:31:00,213 --> 01:31:03,380
LIAM: Deception. That's a 20.

1581
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:08,077
MATT: 20. Okay, it takes a little bit of
convincing, but eventually he sends one of the

1582
01:31:08,077 --> 01:31:10,705
employees to go along with you. They let you into
the room.

1583
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:13,518
LIAM: And now I'm coming back to the beach.

1584
01:31:13,518 --> 01:31:19,019
MATT: Okay, so as you guys come in at the close of
the day-- you've been here for a few days as part

1585
01:31:19,019 --> 01:31:24,027
of your excursion here-- you all come in as you've
had enough time in the sun and you probably need

1586
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:26,127
to get out for a little bit.

1587
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,516
LIAM: Tary, come here.

1588
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:29,725
SAM: Yes?

1589
01:31:29,725 --> 01:31:35,991
LIAM: While you were messing about with Grog,
Percy grabbed your shit and hid it.

1590
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:36,911
SAM: Percival?

1591
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:37,745
LIAM: Yeah.

1592
01:31:37,745 --> 01:31:38,668
SAM: My dear friend?

1593
01:31:38,668 --> 01:31:40,691
LIAM: He was chortling the whole time.

1594
01:31:40,691 --> 01:31:43,586
SAM: I don't believe that he would do such a
thing.

1595
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:45,344
LIAM: All right. I walk away.

1596
01:31:45,344 --> 01:31:46,632
MATT: All right.

1597
01:31:46,632 --> 01:31:49,103
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1598
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:54,426
SAM: Let's go to Percy's room. I'm going to go
knock on his door.

1599
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,563
MATT: Are you in your room, currently?

1600
01:31:57,563 --> 01:31:58,570
TALIESIN: Oh god, no.

1601
01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:00,075
MATT: No answer.

1602
01:32:00,075 --> 01:32:02,511
SAM: I try the door.

1603
01:32:02,511 --> 01:32:04,670
MATT: It's locked.

1604
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:06,920
SAM: Chime of Opening.

1605
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,762
(laughter)

1606
01:32:11,762 --> 01:32:13,581
SAM: Oh, I can open any fucking door.

1607
01:32:13,581 --> 01:32:15,512
TALIESIN: Yes!

1608
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:18,690
TRAVIS: Where have you been all our campaign?

1609
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:20,687
MARISHA: It took us a year.

1610
01:32:20,687 --> 01:32:25,823
LIAM: You're like a Swiss army knife of fixing all
our problems and trolling.

1611
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:27,314
LAURA: We have the same room.

1612
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:28,337
TALIESIN: Okay.

1613
01:32:28,337 --> 01:32:35,535
MATT: Opens up. Quick glance inside, and there's
sand scattered all across the ground, and in the

1614
01:32:35,535 --> 01:32:40,841
far end, right next to the bed, haphazardly jammed
underneath, you see your armor and belongings.

1615
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:45,272
(laughter)

1616
01:32:45,272 --> 01:32:53,121
SAM: We were science bros! How could he? Doty,
this calls for revenge.

1617
01:32:53,121 --> 01:32:56,621
What of his belongings are there?

1618
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:58,229
MATT: Of yours?

1619
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:59,489
SAM: Of his.

1620
01:32:59,489 --> 01:33:05,655
MATT: Of Percival's. That would be-- because you
didn't bring everything.

1621
01:33:05,655 --> 01:33:07,708
TALIESIN: My stuff and Vex's stuff.

1622
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:13,466
MATT: Yeah, so pretty much all of Percival and
Vex's belongings are within the room.

1623
01:33:13,466 --> 01:33:24,537
TALIESIN: Here, take a look. Guns, swords, boots.

1624
01:33:24,537 --> 01:33:30,688
SAM: What can we do, Doty? What can we do?

1625
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:31,995
MATT: "Tary."

1626
01:33:31,995 --> 01:33:35,239
SAM: Good idea, but a little bit too cruel.

1627
01:33:35,239 --> 01:33:41,285
(laughter)

1628
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:45,459
LIAM: "Kill them all, you say?"

1629
01:33:45,532 --> 01:33:51,978
TRAVIS: "But they need their skin to live!"

1630
01:33:52,105 --> 01:33:59,432
SAM: All right. I'll go to my cloak and tear off
the Patch of Two Mastiffs.

1631
01:33:59,512 --> 01:34:01,624
TALIESIN: Oh no.

1632
01:34:01,624 --> 01:34:05,033
SAM: They're two big dogs, right?

1633
01:34:05,033 --> 01:34:06,164
MATT: Yeah.

1634
01:34:06,164 --> 01:34:13,111
SAM: Yeah, all right. And I'll throw some kibble
all over the place and be like, go on, just chew

1635
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:16,011
everything up and make a mess and pee wherever you
want.

1636
01:34:16,011 --> 01:34:20,782
MATT: All right, as you pull the patch and throw
it in the room, it glows a bright orange and then

1637
01:34:20,782 --> 01:34:26,358
flashes and burns into two small coal-like embers
that when they slam into the ground, crack and

1638
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:33,184
open, and from those two embers you see two
full-grown mastiffs. (barking and snorting)

1639
01:34:33,184 --> 01:34:36,821
SAM: There's food in there. Eat it all. Scratch
through everything you want.

1640
01:34:36,821 --> 01:34:40,223
MATT: They both start eating. They go nuts on the
place.

1641
01:34:40,223 --> 01:34:42,640
SAM: And use this as your latrine as well.

1642
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:52,631
MATT: One of them goes, (sniffs) and just pisses
on one of the sacks. You're not quite sure which

1643
01:34:52,631 --> 01:34:53,852
one it is.

1644
01:34:53,852 --> 01:34:58,120
SAM: Good doggy. All right. You're free now. Go
away. I don't know.

1645
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:01,423
MATT: Do you leave them in the room?

1646
01:35:01,423 --> 01:35:06,027
SAM: Yeah, just stay here, go, whatever you want.
I don't know. I feel weird. I don't need a pet

1647
01:35:06,027 --> 01:35:07,771
right now.

1648
01:35:07,771 --> 01:35:15,706
MATT: You leave and close the door behind you?
Okay. All right, so you guys meet up again. You

1649
01:35:15,706 --> 01:35:21,821
get more drinks, you begin to wander the city. Is
there anything else you want to do while you're

1650
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:23,329
out and about for the afternoon?

1651
01:35:23,329 --> 01:35:25,688
ASHLEY: I want to get my hair braided with beads
on the end!

1652
01:35:25,688 --> 01:35:28,779
(cheering)

1653
01:35:28,779 --> 01:35:29,760
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1654
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,117
MATT: All righty.

1655
01:35:31,117 --> 01:35:32,812
ASHLEY: And Grog.

1656
01:35:32,812 --> 01:35:34,019
LAURA: Just the beard?

1657
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:35,210
TRAVIS: Yep.

1658
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:43,860
MATT: All right. You guys ask around about a half
an hour or so, and you're led to one location that

1659
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:50,975
is windowless and has an open archway door with
some fine purple and red silks blocking the entry.

1660
01:35:50,975 --> 01:35:54,516
As you walk inside, there's one woman who's
sitting there, in the process of eating a small

1661
01:35:54,516 --> 01:36:02,606
bowl of fruit. You see she is a dark-skinned
Marquesian, but elf lineage. She has elven

1662
01:36:02,606 --> 01:36:11,232
features. Her hair, which is this dirty brown, is
braided in rows that go down past her waist and

1663
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:17,522
have a series of multi-colored, looks almost like
gems and rings and other cool pieces of jewelry

1664
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:22,805
that are woven into it. As she's looking at this
small book in her lap and eating the fruit, she

1665
01:36:22,805 --> 01:36:26,222
turns around. "Oh, I'm sorry. Hello."

1666
01:36:26,222 --> 01:36:34,878
ASHLEY: Hi. Could we get our hair-- yours looks
amazing. Could we get some hair braids? Tight and

1667
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:41,643
then going down, with some gems and sparkles in
it? And same here, on his beard?

1668
01:36:41,643 --> 01:36:44,308
MATT: "Oh, the beard. I can do that."

1669
01:36:44,308 --> 01:36:45,417
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1670
01:36:45,417 --> 01:36:50,737
MATT: "Yes, of course." Closes her book and sets
it down. "Come, sit."

1671
01:36:50,737 --> 01:36:53,831
LAURA: Some razor blades up in them.

1672
01:36:53,831 --> 01:36:59,100
MATT: She calls out in Marquesian for a moment,
and a younger woman, probably about 15 or so,

1673
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:06,558
comes out. Human, dark-skinned, as well. Both
begin to start working on your hair and your

1674
01:37:06,558 --> 01:37:10,960
beard. Asking about where you're from. It becomes
a conversational piece because you're there for a

1675
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,133
good hour and a half or so to go through all of
your hair and get it done, but nevertheless, you

1676
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:18,213
now have a fantastic series of braids in your
hair.

1677
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:19,961
TRAVIS: She pulled really hard.

1678
01:37:19,961 --> 01:37:26,833
ASHLEY: It looks really good. Do you want to add
any jewels in it?

1679
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,831
TRAVIS: Jewels?

1680
01:37:28,831 --> 01:37:32,265
ASHLEY: Earrings and stuff like how she has?

1681
01:37:32,265 --> 01:37:40,963
TRAVIS: I just want the beads. Little beads and
little braids. No jewels. What about you?

1682
01:37:40,963 --> 01:37:42,571
ASHLEY: I want all of it.

1683
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:43,832
TRAVIS: Everything?

1684
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:45,128
ASHLEY: Just all of it.

1685
01:37:45,128 --> 01:37:46,553
MATT: "All of it?"

1686
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:48,458
ASHLEY: What does all of it cost?

1687
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:52,182
MATT: "If you want more than what I have in
mine--"

1688
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:54,552
ASHLEY: Well, no. Let's not get carried away.

1689
01:37:54,552 --> 01:37:56,699
TRAVIS: Do you want extensions?

1690
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:58,486
ASHLEY: My hair is already so long.

1691
01:37:58,486 --> 01:38:01,520
TRAVIS: It is. Do you want other colored hair in
there, too?

1692
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,686
ASHLEY: Let's put blue in there.

1693
01:38:03,686 --> 01:38:06,392
MATT: "Oh, you wish to color?"

1694
01:38:06,443 --> 01:38:08,538
ASHLEY: Oh, well--

1695
01:38:08,538 --> 01:38:10,346
MATT: "No, it's okay."

1696
01:38:10,346 --> 01:38:12,933
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? Fuck it!

1697
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:20,515
MATT: She talks to her assistant, and the young
girl runs off for a second with a smile. Comes

1698
01:38:20,515 --> 01:38:26,317
back, and there is what looks to be some sort of a
fruit. Looks like a blue pomegranate that's

1699
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:31,500
partially crushed. She takes it and with a mortar
and pestle setup begins mashing it and goes,

1700
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,932
"We can do blue."

1701
01:38:32,932 --> 01:38:34,116
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1702
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:35,156
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1703
01:38:35,156 --> 01:38:36,790
LAURA: So cool!

1704
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:44,858
MATT: The whole endeavor between the two of you
guys is not inexpensive-- few things are in the

1705
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:51,812
Bay of Gifts. It's designed specifically to
survive and thrive on the trade here. Both of you

1706
01:38:51,812 --> 01:38:53,712
guys, it costs about 120 gold.

1707
01:38:53,712 --> 01:38:56,080
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1708
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,097
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

1709
01:38:58,097 --> 01:39:02,623
ASHLEY: So how does that break down? For my hair
versus his?

1710
01:39:02,623 --> 01:39:13,206
MATT: "Oh, for the two? For any sort of masculine
hair endeavors, which is not our specialty-- Well,

1711
01:39:13,315 --> 01:39:17,997
"the beads themselves are made from finely blown
glass and they're individually colored, and those

1712
01:39:17,997 --> 01:39:23,860
"are made specifically by an artisan who is about
three blocks up that way, so those are brought

1713
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:28,586
"here, and those are purchased on our end, as well.
You are paying straight cost of the beads. Time

1714
01:39:28,586 --> 01:39:32,717
"and training, of course, on our end, and we do the
finest work you'll find all across Marquet."

1715
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:43,590
ASHLEY: Well, you know what? I am a very big
supporter of small businesses, so support small

1716
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:46,943
business, and I will give you 120 gold.

1717
01:39:46,943 --> 01:39:51,080
MATT: "The 20 is mainly for him. The 100 was to
give you the dye coloring--"

1718
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,174
LAURA: Oh, it's for both of you guys? Oh, I
thought it was 120 each!

1719
01:39:54,174 --> 01:39:55,924
LIAM: That's all right.

1720
01:39:55,924 --> 01:39:58,962
LAURA: That's not bad. I mean, that's a lot.

1721
01:39:58,962 --> 01:40:05,289
MATT: It's still a lot. But since you've gotten
here, you get the sense that it's-- by nature,

1722
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:09,373
everything here costs a little more. A lot of it's
imported and a lot of it is designed for people

1723
01:40:09,373 --> 01:40:11,678
that are willing to pay for foreign goods.

1724
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:12,636
ASHLEY: Great.

1725
01:40:12,636 --> 01:40:14,164
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to tip?

1726
01:40:14,164 --> 01:40:16,552
LAURA: No, she owns the business so you don't have
to do as much.

1727
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:18,168
TRAVIS: Are you there?

1728
01:40:18,168 --> 01:40:20,168
ASHLEY: Just 120.

1729
01:40:20,168 --> 01:40:23,790
MATT: Very well. So how much blue did you want to
get in your hair?

1730
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:24,953
ASHLEY: Say again?

1731
01:40:24,953 --> 01:40:26,617
MATT: How much blue did you want to get in your
hair?

1732
01:40:26,617 --> 01:40:30,585
ASHLEY: Just some strips, you know. Just some
strips on the white so it pops out.

1733
01:40:30,585 --> 01:40:31,756
MATT: Okay.

1734
01:40:31,756 --> 01:40:32,824
ASHLEY: Just like--

1735
01:40:32,824 --> 01:40:33,682
MATT: All right.

1736
01:40:33,682 --> 01:40:37,288
ASHLEY: You know, dealer's choice. Just get
creative and do what you want.

1737
01:40:37,288 --> 01:40:46,242
MATT: All right. Okay. So upon completion-- It's
very cool. It's pretty close to what you were

1738
01:40:46,242 --> 01:40:51,288
hoping and expecting. You end up with three
streaks: one central one that goes from the

1739
01:40:51,288 --> 01:40:55,630
center, and then two that go from the sides and
back that way.

1740
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,523
LAURA: That's way different than I expected.

1741
01:40:57,523 --> 01:40:58,693
ASHLEY: It's awesome.

1742
01:40:58,693 --> 01:41:01,340
MATT: And then all the tips go to blue, so it's
almost like you have these two blocks of white and

1743
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:03,580
then eventually it all goes blue towards the
edge.

1744
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,493
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Yeah.

1745
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:09,031
LAURA: Imagine what that'll look like when your
hair is down, too, because it'll be like blue all

1746
01:41:09,031 --> 01:41:10,834
over the top and all mixed in everywhere.

1747
01:41:10,834 --> 01:41:12,625
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's pretty cool.

1748
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:13,993
TRAVIS: Hell yeah.

1749
01:41:13,993 --> 01:41:18,941
MATT: So yeah. Anything else you want to
accomplish, or call it an evening?

1750
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:24,343
LAURA: I think just eat a nice dinner and then
head back to the rooms and get ready to wake up in

1751
01:41:24,343 --> 01:41:26,699
the morning and do all the same shit again.

1752
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:29,493
MARISHA: Definitely some magically frozen
daiquiris.

1753
01:41:29,493 --> 01:41:34,371
MATT: You guys all find your way back with some
drinks. The sun has set now, the cold night has

1754
01:41:34,371 --> 01:41:38,208
come in through the bay, but it's still warm. It's
cold by the bay standards, but you guys come from

1755
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:44,800
the northern ends, in Tal'Dorei proper it's still
a pretty warm night. You hear the waves crashing

1756
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:50,415
as you enter the establishment. You all head back
to your rooms to get in more evening attire.

1757
01:41:50,415 --> 01:41:55,916
Percival and Vex-- how long do the hounds last
for?

1758
01:41:55,916 --> 01:41:58,148
SAM: Let me look.

1759
01:41:58,148 --> 01:42:00,270
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

1760
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:03,248
SAM: It just says Two Mastiffs. I think they just
are.

1761
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:06,465
(laughter)

1762
01:42:06,465 --> 01:42:10,208
SAM: It's not like a spell or anything, they are
two dogs that live now.

1763
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:13,270
MATT: I am so excited. I am so excited.

1764
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:16,023
TRAVIS: They don't live for much longer.

1765
01:42:16,023 --> 01:42:22,502
MATT: Okay. So, as soon as you approach, you guys
hear, through the door on the other side, this low

1766
01:42:22,502 --> 01:42:25,649
growl. This (growls).

1767
01:42:25,649 --> 01:42:27,044
TALIESIN: Vex?

1768
01:42:27,044 --> 01:42:28,414
LAURA: What is that?

1769
01:42:28,414 --> 01:42:30,091
TALIESIN: I don't--

1770
01:42:30,091 --> 01:42:36,491
LAURA: I open the door. Just fucking on guard.

1771
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:41,802
MATT: Okay. You come inside to notice the entire
interior of the room has been sundered. Pillows

1772
01:42:41,802 --> 01:42:47,755
and cloth torn and pulled everywhere. The room
smells immediately of heaping piles of dog shit

1773
01:42:47,755 --> 01:42:55,149
and urine. The bed is scattered and torn open. The
curtains have been pulled down, and there, in the

1774
01:42:55,149 --> 01:42:58,108
center of the room, are two massive mastiffs,
mating.

1775
01:42:58,108 --> 01:43:00,668
(laughter)

1776
01:43:00,668 --> 01:43:03,012
LAURA: What the fuck!

1777
01:43:03,012 --> 01:43:05,581
TALIESIN: I grab the door and shut it.

1778
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:07,708
LAURA: Who did this?

1779
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:11,698
TALIESIN: It was either Grog or your brother.
Those are really the only two people who could be

1780
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:13,272
possibly responsible--

1781
01:43:13,272 --> 01:43:16,715
LAURA: Grog! And I take off running to his room.

1782
01:43:16,715 --> 01:43:18,769
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

1783
01:43:18,769 --> 01:43:20,899
TALIESIN: I'm not missing this. I am following.

1784
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:25,357
MATT: Okay. Your door is open, Grog. You're just
there sitting down for a second just grabbing your

1785
01:43:25,357 --> 01:43:30,667
jug. Getting a quick nip before your next nip.

1786
01:43:30,667 --> 01:43:32,003
TRAVIS: Yeah, mini-fridge.

1787
01:43:32,003 --> 01:43:34,933
MATT: And Vex just storms in, heaving mad.

1788
01:43:34,933 --> 01:43:36,522
TRAVIS: Hey. Oh. Hi.

1789
01:43:36,522 --> 01:43:39,187
LAURA: Did you have anything to do with this?

1790
01:43:39,187 --> 01:43:41,399
(laughter)

1791
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:46,420
TRAVIS: I feel like I should ask what, but the
answer's probably yes?

1792
01:43:46,420 --> 01:44:00,797
LAURA: The fucking dogs. Grog! I grab him by his
beaded beard and drag him back to the room.

1793
01:44:00,797 --> 01:44:02,995
TRAVIS: Ah! It's really tight! (yelps)

1794
01:44:02,995 --> 01:44:06,205
MATT: Percival, as you catch up-- She comes around
the corner just dragging Grog

1795
01:44:06,205 --> 01:44:08,066
by the beard behind her.

1796
01:44:08,066 --> 01:44:10,232
TALIESIN: Oh god, she's going to kill you.

1797
01:44:10,232 --> 01:44:12,049
TRAVIS: (groans) What in the-- what-- (groans)

1798
01:44:12,049 --> 01:44:14,281
LAURA: I open the door and throw him in. Did you
do this?

1799
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:18,920
TRAVIS: (sniffs) Ugh. What the fuck?

1800
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,162
MATT: The dogs have stopped mating at this point
and one of them comes over and goes (sniffs,

1801
01:44:22,162 --> 01:44:25,637
chomp) and just bites into your neck. It does
nothing, it just rests there.

1802
01:44:25,637 --> 01:44:27,540
TRAVIS: Is this your fucking dog?

1803
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,062
LAURA: Is this your fucking dog?

1804
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,382
TRAVIS: No! Where am I going to get dogs from?

1805
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:33,062
LAURA: (huffs) True.

1806
01:44:33,062 --> 01:44:35,698
(laughter)

1807
01:44:35,698 --> 01:44:39,155
TRAVIS: Although I don't think this shit and piss
is mine.

1808
01:44:39,155 --> 01:44:41,570
LAURA: (laughs) That's good.

1809
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:42,683
TRAVIS: Yep.

1810
01:44:42,683 --> 01:44:46,478
LAURA: What does our room look like? What does our
stuff look like? Is it ruined?

1811
01:44:46,478 --> 01:44:48,085
MATT: Your stuff isn't--

1812
01:44:48,085 --> 01:44:49,606
LIAM: Not the magical items.

1813
01:44:49,606 --> 01:44:51,594
TALIESIN: The stuff in the closet is probably--

1814
01:44:51,594 --> 01:44:55,806
MATT: Yeah. You didn't just leave your stuff on
the floor, there. You had things put away inside

1815
01:44:55,806 --> 01:44:58,616
the cabinets and stuff. And the things that were
in the cabinets were fine. So most of your general

1816
01:44:58,616 --> 01:45:08,489
clothing is all right. It's more like your sacks,
anything that was just loose. Your boots. All just

1817
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:10,508
smell of dog piss.

1818
01:45:10,508 --> 01:45:12,975
LAURA: How did they even get in? I take off to the
front desk.

1819
01:45:12,975 --> 01:45:15,574
(laughter)

1820
01:45:15,574 --> 01:45:17,493
SAM: Oh, shit.

1821
01:45:17,493 --> 01:45:20,459
TRAVIS: Can I let the mastiffs have a couple of
licks from the alchemy jug full of beer that I was

1822
01:45:20,459 --> 01:45:21,728
drinking out of?

1823
01:45:21,728 --> 01:45:25,641
MATT: They do have a lick. Big old mastiff
tongues.

1824
01:45:25,641 --> 01:45:27,568
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find Vax.

1825
01:45:27,568 --> 01:45:35,299
MATT: Okay. As you rush off to the front counter,
you can see Guath, the Marquesian, is still there.

1826
01:45:35,299 --> 01:45:38,715
He's in the process of going through the books,
making sure he's keeping everything tidy and he

1827
01:45:38,715 --> 01:45:41,383
sees you approach. "Ah, hello! Is there anything
of--"

1828
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:43,994
LAURA: Who-- Hi.

1829
01:45:43,994 --> 01:45:45,110
MATT: "Hello."

1830
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:48,698
LAURA: Who was in our room? Did you send anyone to
our room?

1831
01:45:48,698 --> 01:45:53,571
MATT: "Uh. Yes. Yes, there was--"

1832
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:55,717
LAURA: Who was it?

1833
01:45:55,717 --> 01:46:00,115
MATT: "The other who looks like you. He came by
and said that he was supposed to put the--

1834
01:46:00,115 --> 01:46:02,476
"We had to send--"

1835
01:46:02,476 --> 01:46:04,082
(laughter)

1836
01:46:04,082 --> 01:46:05,433
SAM: Yes!

1837
01:46:05,433 --> 01:46:11,662
MATT: "He said he had to put things in the room
for you. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. If this is

1838
01:46:11,662 --> 01:46:14,736
"a problem, we can call the-- You wish us to call
the guards over here?"

1839
01:46:14,736 --> 01:46:22,031
LAURA: (scoffs) How? Why? Vax! And I take off
running. Vax! Where are you? Where are you?

1840
01:46:22,031 --> 01:46:23,484
LIAM: I'm in my room.

1841
01:46:23,484 --> 01:46:24,365
LAURA: Ooh!

1842
01:46:24,365 --> 01:46:27,598
TALIESIN: I have just turned the corner towards
Vax's room. I'm probably just now in eyesight.

1843
01:46:27,598 --> 01:46:28,746
LAURA: I sprint and I--

1844
01:46:28,746 --> 01:46:30,820
MARISHA: I just showered, you guys, now's not a
good time. I'm just--

1845
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:33,851
LAURA: Trinket, off with me, we're ready to
fucking fight. He's out of my necklace and we're

1846
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:36,250
taking off towards Vax's room.

1847
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:38,605
LIAM: Did you say you're coming to the room?

1848
01:46:38,605 --> 01:46:39,991
LAURA: You are dead.

1849
01:46:39,991 --> 01:46:41,258
TALIESIN: Can I hear this?

1850
01:46:41,258 --> 01:46:42,257
LIAM: I mean, practically.

1851
01:46:42,257 --> 01:46:43,215
MATT: Yeah.

1852
01:46:43,215 --> 01:46:44,886
SAM: I can too.

1853
01:46:44,886 --> 01:46:47,698
TRAVIS: We're all making our way over to Vax's
room.

1854
01:46:47,698 --> 01:46:51,389
LIAM: Kiki, might want to go to into the bathroom.
I think that my sister is coming. Whoa!

1855
01:46:51,389 --> 01:46:53,602
LAURA: Keyleth.

1856
01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:55,512
MARISHA: Hi, Vex.

1857
01:46:55,512 --> 01:46:57,500
LAURA: Put some clothes on.

1858
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,471
LIAM: I guess I will as well.

1859
01:46:59,471 --> 01:47:01,405
MARISHA: I feel like we're in trouble.

1860
01:47:01,405 --> 01:47:02,665
LAURA: Not you.

1861
01:47:02,665 --> 01:47:04,414
LIAM: Yoink. What?

1862
01:47:04,414 --> 01:47:09,784
LAURA: What the fuck did you do? Why the fuck
would you do that in our room?

1863
01:47:09,784 --> 01:47:13,048
LIAM: What did I do in your room?

1864
01:47:13,048 --> 01:47:14,912
LAURA: Destroyed it.

1865
01:47:14,912 --> 01:47:19,463
LIAM: Why would I destroy your room on the first
day of our vacation?

1866
01:47:19,463 --> 01:47:24,335
LAURA: Did you-- Did he-- Did you-- Why would
you?

1867
01:47:24,335 --> 01:47:28,956
LIAM: I wouldn't. What are you talking about?

1868
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:32,021
LAURA: The dogs. Shit and piss everywhere. I know
you were in our room.

1869
01:47:32,021 --> 01:47:32,821
LIAM: Dogs?

1870
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,818
MARISHA: There are dogs? (gasps) What kind of dogs
are they?

1871
01:47:35,818 --> 01:47:38,840
TALIESIN: Why don't you come with me and I'm going
to go show you while they talk.

1872
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,931
MARISHA: Okay.

1873
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:42,352
LIAM: Are you pranking me? What are you talking
about?

1874
01:47:42,352 --> 01:47:44,084
LAURA: Ooh. I just yank your hair as hard as I
can.

1875
01:47:44,084 --> 01:47:48,124
LIAM: (yells) What are you doing?

1876
01:47:48,124 --> 01:47:49,906
LAURA: Why would you do it? Why?

1877
01:47:49,906 --> 01:47:52,371
LIAM: Do what? You have to be more specific.

1878
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:55,847
LAURA: Dogs. Shitting and ruining everything in
our room.

1879
01:47:55,847 --> 01:47:58,749
LIAM: What the fuck are you talking about? Dogs? I
don't have any dogs.

1880
01:47:58,749 --> 01:48:00,091
LAURA: Don't you lie to me.

1881
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:03,806
LIAM: I don't have any magic. I can heal a little
bit and that's it. What are you talking about?

1882
01:48:03,806 --> 01:48:07,990
LAURA: They're not even magic dogs, they're just
dogs! Can I roll to see if he's fucking telling

1883
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,885
the truth?

1884
01:48:08,885 --> 01:48:10,739
MATT: Make an insight check.

1885
01:48:10,739 --> 01:48:11,890
LIAM: I'll make my deception check.

1886
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:13,788
TALIESIN: Kiki, we've always been friends.

1887
01:48:13,788 --> 01:48:15,258
MARISHA: Yeah, of course.

1888
01:48:15,258 --> 01:48:16,567
LAURA: 18.

1889
01:48:16,567 --> 01:48:17,996
TALIESIN: I want you to know this is nothing
personal but this is--

1890
01:48:17,996 --> 01:48:19,262
TRAVIS: Is that your second Luck?

1891
01:48:19,262 --> 01:48:20,162
LIAM: Yes, it was.

1892
01:48:20,162 --> 01:48:21,749
MATT: That's the second Luck, yeah.

1893
01:48:21,749 --> 01:48:26,387
TALIESIN: And I open the door and show you. And
then I shove you in and shut the door for a

1894
01:48:26,387 --> 01:48:27,307
moment.

1895
01:48:27,307 --> 01:48:29,122
MATT: You can see he's covering up. You don't
quite know the full specifics, but you know he's

1896
01:48:29,122 --> 01:48:29,838
covering.

1897
01:48:29,838 --> 01:48:31,401
LAURA: I know you were in our room and I know
you're lying to me.

1898
01:48:31,401 --> 01:48:33,573
LIAM: I was not in your room. I am not lying to
you, I don't-- (yells)

1899
01:48:33,573 --> 01:48:37,931
LAURA: I just yank him out of the room. Trinket!

1900
01:48:37,931 --> 01:48:39,154
LIAM: What are you-- what?

1901
01:48:39,154 --> 01:48:40,266
LAURA: Sic him!

1902
01:48:40,266 --> 01:48:43,020
(laughter)

1903
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:47,242
MATT: At this point, she's pulled you out into the
hallway. You now see, the bear you've grown up

1904
01:48:47,242 --> 01:48:52,989
with and loved, for the first time, you realize
how massive and scary this bear could be as it

1905
01:48:52,989 --> 01:48:57,481
(growls, heavy steps).

1906
01:48:57,481 --> 01:49:00,050
LIAM: I click my Boots of Haste!

1907
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:02,416
TRAVIS: You were fucking naked a second ago.

1908
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:05,719
MATT: Trinket charges you.

1909
01:49:05,719 --> 01:49:13,926
LIAM: This is improvisation. If I say it, it's
real. That's how this fucking works.

1910
01:49:13,926 --> 01:49:15,746
SAM: You were putting on your boots?

1911
01:49:15,746 --> 01:49:17,277
MATT: So what are you doing? Trinket's coming at
you.

1912
01:49:17,277 --> 01:49:18,702
LIAM: I'm running in my boots!

1913
01:49:18,702 --> 01:49:19,823
MATT: All right.

1914
01:49:19,823 --> 01:49:22,424
LAURA: I have the back of his head. I have his
hair.

1915
01:49:22,424 --> 01:49:23,413
LIAM: Disengage.

1916
01:49:23,413 --> 01:49:26,225
MATT: Okay. So hold on. She does have your hair.

1917
01:49:26,225 --> 01:49:27,065
LIAM: Yeah.

1918
01:49:27,065 --> 01:49:28,748
MATT: Technically, it's a grapple.

1919
01:49:28,748 --> 01:49:34,380
LIAM: Okay. You want to make it a strength check?
I know my strength is double hers.

1920
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,720
LAURA: (gasps) Your strength is double mine?

1921
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,316
MATT: It's athletics and acrobatics versus her--

1922
01:49:38,316 --> 01:49:41,421
LIAM: Okay. Oh, acrobatics, okay.

1923
01:49:41,421 --> 01:49:42,898
LAURA: Versus my strength?

1924
01:49:42,898 --> 01:49:44,552
MATT: I'll double-check real fast. I should
remember this, but for this one particularly I

1925
01:49:44,552 --> 01:49:46,406
want to make sure that I get specifics right
here.

1926
01:49:46,406 --> 01:49:47,649
TALIESIN: This is so great.

1927
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:49,645
SAM: Forget rolling for sand castles, this is it.

1928
01:49:49,645 --> 01:49:51,377
(laughter)

1929
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:58,488
MATT: Yeah, man. This is the craziest shit.
(laughs) I didn't expect it to go this way.

1930
01:49:58,488 --> 01:50:01,945
TALIESIN: I vaguely wonder what you actually 
had planned for this.

1931
01:50:02,015 --> 01:50:03,332
MATT: Not all this!

1932
01:50:03,332 --> 01:50:04,880
TALIESIN: This is bedlam, at this point.

1933
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,784
MATT: This went in a whole different direction.

1934
01:50:07,784 --> 01:50:11,884
SAM: A big title card comes over the frame: Night
One.

1935
01:50:11,884 --> 01:50:15,051
(laughter)

1936
01:50:15,051 --> 01:50:19,254
MATT: Okay, yeah. It's athletics or acrobatics
versus her athletics.

1937
01:50:19,254 --> 01:50:20,368
LAURA: Oh.

1938
01:50:20,368 --> 01:50:23,412
LIAM: Well, I will choose acrobatics.

1939
01:50:23,412 --> 01:50:24,913
LAURA: Motherfuck.

1940
01:50:24,913 --> 01:50:27,631
MATT: Go ahead and roll your acrobatics. Roll your
athletics.

1941
01:50:27,631 --> 01:50:32,156
LAURA: Ugh, it was almost good.

1942
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:34,306
LIAM: 29.

1943
01:50:34,306 --> 01:50:35,671
LAURA: Six!

1944
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:42,279
MATT: You slip out from her grasp right as Trinket
comes upon you. What's your speed?

1945
01:50:42,279 --> 01:50:46,208
LIAM: Fucking wicked, man. I'm double-speed, so
60.

1946
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:48,571
MATT: You don't have your boots on, you just put
your pants on!

1947
01:50:48,571 --> 01:50:50,355
ASHLEY: Weren't you in the shower?

1948
01:50:50,355 --> 01:50:53,146
MATT: You mimicked putting your pants on.

1949
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:54,704
LIAM: All right. 30.

1950
01:50:54,704 --> 01:50:56,944
MATT: Okay. Trinket's movement is?

1951
01:50:56,944 --> 01:51:00,742
LAURA: Oh, he's got 40.

1952
01:51:00,742 --> 01:51:02,234
MATT: Trinket is gaining on you.

1953
01:51:02,234 --> 01:51:04,772
(laughter)

1954
01:51:04,772 --> 01:51:14,182
MATT: You watch as an older couple emerge from the
room down the hallway and go, "Nope." And close

1955
01:51:14,182 --> 01:51:15,520
the door.

1956
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,290
LIAM: I see food trays left by other customers. I
start knocking them down and dumping food on the

1957
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:22,264
rug behind me as I run. It's improv. It's real!

1958
01:51:22,264 --> 01:51:25,118
MATT: There are small baskets.

1959
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:26,466
LIAM: I said I saw food!

1960
01:51:26,466 --> 01:51:31,789
MATT: Yeah, so you knock some baskets behind you
and you keep running. You just emerge from the

1961
01:51:31,789 --> 01:51:34,186
edge of the hallway. You can see the beach ahead
of you. You can see the little bit of moonlight

1962
01:51:34,186 --> 01:51:35,955
hitting the sand in front.

1963
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:37,121
LIAM: What's around me?

1964
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:38,713
MATT: Hallways and doors.

1965
01:51:38,713 --> 01:51:40,996
MARISHA: Is our room nearby? Did he see me get
shoved in?

1966
01:51:40,996 --> 01:51:45,283
TALIESIN: He wouldn't have seen you get shoved in,
but he would have seen me in the hallway at this

1967
01:51:45,283 --> 01:51:46,682
point, if he passed her.

1968
01:51:46,682 --> 01:51:50,845
MATT: I'd say you moved one direction. Trinket
went and chased him down the other side, so this

1969
01:51:50,845 --> 01:51:52,323
is going away from you guys.

1970
01:51:52,323 --> 01:51:55,196
MARISHA: Hey, Vax? I think they're really mad at
us.

1971
01:51:55,196 --> 01:51:57,603
LIAM: Little busy, little busy, little busy!

1972
01:51:57,603 --> 01:52:04,940
MATT: Just as you emerge to part of the sand and
you think you're home free, you stop hearing

1973
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:15,387
Trinket's footfalls. (whack) Leapt and just
impacts you on the sand and both of you tumble,

1974
01:52:15,387 --> 01:52:22,368
end-over-end, through the sand. Eventually, you
land flat on your back and Trinket pounces on top

1975
01:52:22,368 --> 01:52:27,493
of you, your breath (groans) as your chest gets
closed in. And right up in your face, pinning you

1976
01:52:27,493 --> 01:52:28,899
down, going (growls).

1977
01:52:28,899 --> 01:52:31,317
LIAM: I immediately start doing this.

1978
01:52:31,317 --> 01:52:32,270
SAM: What is that?

1979
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:33,653
LIAM: This is me rubbing his tummy.

1980
01:52:33,653 --> 01:52:37,167
LAURA: Oh. Don't fall for it, Trinket!

1981
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,704
MATT: (growls)

1982
01:52:38,704 --> 01:52:41,480
(laughter)

1983
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:46,880
MATT: You are pinned by a very heavy bear, to the
point where your breathing is (shallow panting).

1984
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:53,666
LIAM: You hear from under the bear, (muffled) I
have been here before, and I will be here again!

1985
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:58,547
LAURA: Why would you do it? It's such a beautiful
vacation and you ruined it.

1986
01:52:58,547 --> 01:53:00,275
You ruined all of our things.

1987
01:53:00,275 --> 01:53:03,429
LIAM: Did I ruin it? What did I ruin? I still
don't know what happened.

1988
01:53:03,429 --> 01:53:07,070
LAURA: Vax, you let two dogs loose in our room and
they shit and pissed all over everything, and our

1989
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:09,350
bed is ruined. They were fucking in our bed!

1990
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:12,108
LIAM: I did not fucking let two dogs--

1991
01:53:12,108 --> 01:53:15,953
LAURA: Then what did you do? I know you were in
our room. I know you're lying to me.

1992
01:53:15,953 --> 01:53:21,514
LIAM: I was there for five seconds. I put Taryon's
armor under the bed and then I left. I was in

1993
01:53:21,514 --> 01:53:24,788
there for 30 seconds. I don't have any dogs. I
don't know dogs.

1994
01:53:24,788 --> 01:53:27,285
LAURA: Why would you put Taryon's armor in our
room?

1995
01:53:27,285 --> 01:53:30,840
LIAM: Because it was fucking hilarious!

1996
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,787
LAURA: Wait a minute.

1997
01:53:32,787 --> 01:53:35,298
MARISHA: That's the trolliest thing you've said,
ever!

1998
01:53:35,298 --> 01:53:37,645
LAURA: Did you tell Tary?

1999
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:39,216
LIAM: I did.

2000
01:53:39,216 --> 01:53:42,048
LAURA: So Tary did this?

2001
01:53:42,048 --> 01:53:44,135
LIAM: What happened?

2002
01:53:44,135 --> 01:53:54,258
LAURA: Someone let two giant dogs loose in our
room, and they destroyed our things. Just

2003
01:53:54,258 --> 01:53:59,524
destroyed it. And now, on top of having everything
ruined, we're probably going to have to pay for

2004
01:53:59,524 --> 01:54:02,823
damages. Which will be coming out of your funds,
by the way.

2005
01:54:02,823 --> 01:54:06,724
LIAM: That's the funniest bit, because I have no
money.

2006
01:54:06,724 --> 01:54:20,368
LAURA: Well, then Keyleth. Trinket, stay on him
for a while. Just for a while. Feel free to

2007
01:54:20,368 --> 01:54:22,784
relieve yourself.

2008
01:54:22,784 --> 01:54:25,027
(laughter)

2009
01:54:25,027 --> 01:54:28,734
MATT: Trinket's head slowly turns over back
towards you with a, "What?"

2010
01:54:28,734 --> 01:54:31,325
LAURA: Just a little time. And I walk.

2011
01:54:31,325 --> 01:54:35,298
MATT: As you walk away, Trinket's head moves back
to you, and if you could see a bear smile?

2012
01:54:35,298 --> 01:54:45,111
LIAM: Yeah. When she's gone and it's just us, I
say, she thinks I care. I don't care. Does she let

2013
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:50,858
you kiss her? No, she doesn't. But you get to kiss
me all you want, so have at it, buddy.

2014
01:54:50,858 --> 01:54:53,216
MATT: Trinket goes, (grunts).

2015
01:54:53,216 --> 01:54:55,452
LIAM: It's all right.

2016
01:54:55,452 --> 01:54:57,703
MATT: And you feel your lower regions get warmer.

2017
01:54:57,703 --> 01:55:00,778
(groaning and laughter)

2018
01:55:00,778 --> 01:55:02,676
LAURA: You got pissed on.

2019
01:55:02,676 --> 01:55:07,949
LIAM: I've been inside a dragon's fucking stomach,
buddy. I don't care. The beach is 50 feet that

2020
01:55:07,949 --> 01:55:10,117
way. Get it all out.

2021
01:55:10,117 --> 01:55:16,731
MATT: All right, while you're pinned there, you
march off. You guys just now catch up to the

2022
01:55:16,731 --> 01:55:18,005
chaos.

2023
01:55:18,005 --> 01:55:22,193
MARISHA: I have to say, wherever these dogs came
from, they're very beautiful dogs. Look purebred.

2024
01:55:22,193 --> 01:55:26,421
Very great muscular structure. Come here, boys.
Come here!

2025
01:55:26,421 --> 01:55:29,327
MATT: Keyleth's currently getting the mastiffs out
of the room.

2026
01:55:29,327 --> 01:55:31,821
MARISHA: Can I Speak With Animals to them?

2027
01:55:31,821 --> 01:55:33,025
MATT: Yeah.

2028
01:55:33,025 --> 01:55:36,778
MARISHA: Come here, boys. Come here. I take out
some beef jerky. Come here. That's good boys.

2029
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:38,082
Good boys.

2030
01:55:38,082 --> 01:55:40,664
LAURA: Where did you have beef jerky?

2031
01:55:40,664 --> 01:55:43,052
MARISHA: Fish jerky from where we were at the
casino earlier.

2032
01:55:43,052 --> 01:55:44,687
SAM: Oh snap!

2033
01:55:44,687 --> 01:55:48,177
MARISHA: As Liam O'Brien said, it's improv, so
that makes it true!

2034
01:55:48,177 --> 01:55:50,072
LAURA: I'm just wondering--

2035
01:55:50,072 --> 01:55:57,192
LIAM: You fucking made out that you were hiding in
crystal clear bathwater, motherfucker! If you say

2036
01:55:57,192 --> 01:55:59,773
it, it's real!

2037
01:55:59,773 --> 01:56:04,007
MARISHA: Right, so just like the internet, if you
say it, it's real. Come here, boys.

2038
01:56:04,007 --> 01:56:07,182
MATT: Animal handling.

2039
01:56:07,182 --> 01:56:13,675
MARISHA: Oh, it smells. You boys did a number in
this room. Okay.

2040
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:19,955
(laughter)

2041
01:56:19,955 --> 01:56:22,592
MARISHA: I've got to have some advantage for being
a fucking druid, right?

2042
01:56:22,592 --> 01:56:23,531
MATT: No.

2043
01:56:23,531 --> 01:56:25,183
MARISHA: That's a one.

2044
01:56:25,183 --> 01:56:31,104
MATT: So you say, "Come here, boys." They both
look at you. They rush up, grab the jerky out of

2045
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:36,228
your hands, and dart out of the room. You hear
them, (barks) vanishing.

2046
01:56:36,228 --> 01:56:39,782
MARISHA: Fuck these dogs! That's why you said we
should never own dogs.

2047
01:56:39,782 --> 01:56:43,782
MATT: Taryon?

2048
01:56:43,782 --> 01:56:47,202
SAM: I'm getting night cream put on me by Doty.

2049
01:56:47,202 --> 01:56:50,395
(laughter)

2050
01:56:50,395 --> 01:56:53,161
SAM: Doty, could you sing to me?

2051
01:56:53,161 --> 01:57:02,484
MATT: (sings) "Tary. Tary. Tary." It's all the
same. It's all horribly mechanical-sounding and

2052
01:57:02,484 --> 01:57:06,980
echo-y. It's not singing more than it's repeating
your name over and over again in the same

2053
01:57:07,196 --> 01:57:09,220
intonation. It's horrifying.

2054
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:11,885
MARISHA: Percy?

2055
01:57:11,885 --> 01:57:14,806
TALIESIN: You're going to have to help us clean at
least our personal belongings.

2056
01:57:14,806 --> 01:57:20,386
MARISHA: I didn't do this! I'm more than happy to
help, but I just want you to know: I had nothing

2057
01:57:20,386 --> 01:57:21,564
to do with this.

2058
01:57:21,564 --> 01:57:26,684
TALIESIN: Oh, I know. I know you had nothing to do
with this. He's useless. You're not, so I'm going

2059
01:57:26,684 --> 01:57:29,105
to make you help on his behalf.

2060
01:57:29,105 --> 01:57:36,099
MARISHA: It smells like shit. Like a giant fucking
locker down shit in here.

2061
01:57:36,099 --> 01:57:40,998
TALIESIN: Worse than hell. Legitimately worse than
hell. This is making me miss hell.

2062
01:57:40,998 --> 01:57:47,044
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Control Water. Can I
magic this clean-up like it's

2063
01:57:47,044 --> 01:57:49,157
Fantasia or some shit?

2064
01:57:49,157 --> 01:57:50,729
MATT: That is Prestidigitation.

2065
01:57:50,729 --> 01:57:54,247
MARISHA: No, can I Control Water and levitate the
urine?

2066
01:57:54,247 --> 01:57:55,746
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally.

2067
01:57:55,746 --> 01:57:59,466
MATT: You know what? Yes, I'll let you do that. I
will let you Control Urine.

2068
01:57:59,466 --> 01:58:09,080
MARISHA: I am the leader of my tribe, and I am
doing janitorial duties. Ugh.

2069
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:12,812
MATT: After completing your Aramente, after years
of training in the druidic arts and becoming the

2070
01:58:12,812 --> 01:58:17,403
leader of your people, you are reduced to lifting
the urine from a ruined hotel room.

2071
01:58:17,403 --> 01:58:20,325
TALIESIN: I would like you to meditate upon who is
responsible for this.

2072
01:58:20,377 --> 01:58:24,697
MARISHA: Fucking Vox Machina pieces of-- why am
I-- why are we us?

2073
01:58:24,697 --> 01:58:29,522
TALIESIN: This is your boy. I'm taking no
responsibility for this one.

2074
01:58:29,522 --> 01:58:32,778
MARISHA: Okay, I control the water and fling it
into the ocean.

2075
01:58:32,778 --> 01:58:34,603
MATT: Okay.

2076
01:58:34,603 --> 01:58:37,633
LIAM: I'm hearing all this over the earring, and I
whisper, only to Trinket:

2077
01:58:37,633 --> 01:58:41,129
I'm back, Trinket. I'm back.

2078
01:58:41,129 --> 01:58:44,450
(laughter)

2079
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:48,166
MARISHA: I control a little of the urine that
dribbled in the hall, as well. I don't want us to

2080
01:58:48,166 --> 01:58:49,608
get kicked out by the hotel.

2081
01:58:49,608 --> 01:58:53,193
MATT: The room's still destroyed. For the sake of
brevity, here--

2082
01:58:53,193 --> 01:58:57,304
TALIESIN: Some wild dogs attacked our room.

2083
01:58:57,304 --> 01:59:00,613
MATT: Who's talking to the manager about this?

2084
01:59:00,613 --> 01:59:01,960
LAURA: Percy is.

2085
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:03,288
TALIESIN: I'll speak to the manager.

2086
01:59:03,288 --> 01:59:04,272
MATT: All right.

2087
01:59:04,272 --> 01:59:05,765
SAM: (giggles) Wild dogs?

2088
01:59:05,765 --> 01:59:09,064
MARISHA: Wild ocean dogs. Beach dogs.

2089
01:59:09,064 --> 01:59:15,829
MATT: So at this point, while all this has
happened, Guath, the gentleman at the front, sees

2090
01:59:15,829 --> 01:59:21,658
the bear and is like, "What is going--" (yelps)
The dogs go (barks) and jump past him. The

2091
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:28,490
slightly chubby halfling comes forward. "What the
fuck is going on?"

2092
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:31,227
MARISHA: You tell us, man.

2093
01:59:31,227 --> 01:59:35,018
MATT: "No, you tell me. This is my place! Whose
dogs were those?"

2094
01:59:35,018 --> 01:59:39,600
TALIESIN: We have no idea. We came back and they
were in our room, pissing on our stuff.

2095
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,857
MATT: Make a deception check.

2096
01:59:40,857 --> 01:59:41,973
TALIESIN: This is not deception!

2097
01:59:41,973 --> 01:59:43,450
MATT: You know whose they are.

2098
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,565
TALIESIN: Actually, do I know whose they are?

2099
01:59:45,565 --> 01:59:47,723
MATT: You've been hearing it over the earring this
whole time.

2100
01:59:47,723 --> 01:59:49,355
TALIESIN: I don't know where they came from.

2101
01:59:49,355 --> 01:59:51,026
TRAVIS: That's true, he hasn't said.

2102
01:59:51,026 --> 01:59:52,531
MATT: That's true.

2103
01:59:52,531 --> 01:59:53,696
TALIESIN: I'll do deception.

2104
01:59:53,696 --> 01:59:54,913
MATT: Persuasion.

2105
01:59:54,913 --> 01:59:59,510
TALIESIN: Persuasion? Well, deception's higher,
but I'll try persuasion.

2106
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:01,901
(laughter)

2107
02:00:01,901 --> 02:00:03,198
MARISHA: What the fuck, man?

2108
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:04,599
TALIESIN: No, god damn it.

2109
02:00:04,599 --> 02:00:05,576
SAM: Honor yourself.

2110
02:00:05,576 --> 02:00:08,886
TALIESIN: I'm honoring myself. It doesn't matter,
anyway. That's 27.

2111
02:00:09,105 --> 02:00:11,402
MATT: He goes, (sighs).

2112
02:00:11,402 --> 02:00:18,079
TALIESIN: I mean, it was upsetting. Your property,
our property. This is our problem. All of us.

2113
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:23,169
MATT: "Let me see." He pulls past and makes his
way towards the room, and looks inside, and you

2114
02:00:23,169 --> 02:00:25,571
can see him go, (distressed noise).

2115
02:00:25,571 --> 02:00:29,158
TALIESIN: Has this happened before?

2116
02:00:29,158 --> 02:00:36,335
MATT: "No! I've never seen those dogs here before.
The breed? They don't exist!"

2117
02:00:36,335 --> 02:00:39,017
(laughter)

2118
02:00:39,017 --> 02:00:43,905
TALIESIN: I've never seen them before, either.
I've never seen anything like it.

2119
02:00:43,905 --> 02:00:47,651
MATT: (exclaims in a foreign language)

2120
02:00:47,651 --> 02:00:50,469
TALIESIN: How good a job did you do on our stuff?

2121
02:00:50,469 --> 02:00:54,992
MATT: It's still torn and messed up, but it's not
covered in urine.

2122
02:00:54,992 --> 02:00:57,025
It still smells terrible in there.

2123
02:00:57,025 --> 02:00:59,194
LIAM: Your clothes and bullshit is fine.

2124
02:00:59,194 --> 02:01:00,471
TALIESIN: I know.

2125
02:01:00,471 --> 02:01:02,854
MATT: "I'm so sorry."

2126
02:01:02,854 --> 02:01:06,161
TALIESIN: It's hardly your fault. This is
ridiculous.

2127
02:01:06,161 --> 02:01:12,877
MATT: "We'll get you a new room immediately. Hey!"
Two servants come out immediately. He starts

2128
02:01:12,877 --> 02:01:17,750
shouting out to them in Marquesian. They walk off
and eventually people start coming in and

2129
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:21,384
pulling your stuff out of the room and taking it
to another chamber. It's down two halls over, so

2130
02:01:21,456 --> 02:01:23,846
you guys are separated from everybody else.

2131
02:01:23,846 --> 02:01:28,542
TALIESIN: We have a lot of foreign guests as well,
in our establishment back home, so I know how

2132
02:01:28,542 --> 02:01:31,614
things can sometimes get a bit crazy, and I
certainly don't want to put any

2133
02:01:31,614 --> 02:01:33,222
undue pressure on you.

2134
02:01:33,222 --> 02:01:35,527
MATT: "Oh, it is okay. We will launch an
investigation immediately."

2135
02:01:35,527 --> 02:01:36,748
TALIESIN: Excellent.

2136
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:44,386
MATT: So. (laughs) Vex, anything else you want to
do?

2137
02:01:44,386 --> 02:01:47,392
LAURA: Yeah, I want to go knock on Tary's door.

2138
02:01:47,392 --> 02:01:56,322
MATT: You hear through the doorway this really
creepy, "Tary. Tary."

2139
02:01:56,322 --> 02:02:01,492
SAM: I'll take off my blinders, my night-blinders.

2140
02:02:01,535 --> 02:02:04,147
TALIESIN: Do they actually have little cucumbers
drawn on them?

2141
02:02:04,147 --> 02:02:06,307
SAM: My mask. Come in.

2142
02:02:06,307 --> 02:02:09,963
LAURA: Do you have Doty singing to you again?

2143
02:02:09,963 --> 02:02:15,323
SAM: Oh, yes. He sings me to sleep now. It's sort
of a ritual we have.

2144
02:02:15,323 --> 02:02:17,359
LAURA: I shut the door.

2145
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:20,295
SAM: Did you have a nice night, Little Elf Girl?

2146
02:02:20,295 --> 02:02:30,620
LAURA: I didn't, Goldie. Actually, did you happen
to set a couple of dogs loose in our room?

2147
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:34,984
SAM: Well, between you and me, I did.

2148
02:02:34,984 --> 02:02:37,747
LAURA: Oh, you did?

2149
02:02:37,747 --> 02:02:43,320
SAM: You see, Percival played a little bit of a
prank on me, and I got him back.

2150
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:49,421
LAURA: Yes. Well, you also got me back, and
actually, it wasn't Percival, it was my brother

2151
02:02:49,421 --> 02:02:52,728
who did it. Stole your armor?

2152
02:02:52,728 --> 02:02:54,066
SAM: But he told me that it was--

2153
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:55,130
LAURA: Yes.

2154
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:56,619
SAM: He told me--

2155
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:05,308
LAURA: Yes, and you believed him over your two
best friends?

2156
02:03:05,308 --> 02:03:18,148
SAM: You've taught me so much, but not about the
human heart. (sighs) I am so sorry. I should have

2157
02:03:18,211 --> 02:03:19,512
trusted you.

2158
02:03:19,512 --> 02:03:20,633
LAURA: You should've!

2159
02:03:20,633 --> 02:03:27,432
SAM: I should have not doubted my staunchest ally,
Percival. Of course, someone as trained as he is

2160
02:03:27,432 --> 02:03:34,989
in the sciences wouldn't lie to me like that. I
failed you.

2161
02:03:34,989 --> 02:03:36,843
LAURA: Tary, you know I can't stay mad at you!

2162
02:03:36,843 --> 02:03:37,832
SAM: I'm so sorry!

2163
02:03:37,832 --> 02:03:41,420
(laughter)

2164
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:43,411
SAM: What can I do to make it up?

2165
02:03:43,411 --> 02:03:45,284
LAURA: I don't know--

2166
02:03:45,284 --> 02:03:47,379
SAM: Doty, go clean their room.

2167
02:03:47,379 --> 02:03:48,825
LAURA: Thank you, dear.

2168
02:03:48,825 --> 02:03:52,428
SAM: I'm so sorry.

2169
02:03:52,428 --> 02:03:54,065
LAURA: Oh, it was disgusting.

2170
02:03:54,065 --> 02:03:55,610
SAM: But your brother.

2171
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:58,296
LAURA: I know! Trinket peed on him.

2172
02:03:58,296 --> 02:04:06,019
SAM: Trinket peed on him? Well, that's pretty
good. I feel like there's more revenge to be had,

2173
02:04:06,019 --> 02:04:09,145
but you know what? We're on vacation.

2174
02:04:09,145 --> 02:04:13,176
LIAM: Over their earrings, they hear, he also
dropped a loaf.

2175
02:04:13,176 --> 02:04:16,403
LAURA: He also dropped a loaf, apparently.

2176
02:04:16,403 --> 02:04:23,406
SAM: That's nice. All right. I'm so sorry. Will
you forgive me?

2177
02:04:23,406 --> 02:04:25,823
LAURA: Of course I do, dear. Have a wonderful
night's sleep.

2178
02:04:25,823 --> 02:04:27,014
SAM: You, too.

2179
02:04:27,014 --> 02:04:29,192
LAURA: I'll send Doty back when he's done.

2180
02:04:29,192 --> 02:04:36,758
SAM: He can last forever, so just as long as you
need him. He'll wash whatever you need. He has

2181
02:04:36,758 --> 02:04:41,255
motor skills. Not fine motor skills, but he could
try to sew something if anything was ripped.

2182
02:04:41,255 --> 02:04:43,069
LAURA: I'll check it out and I'll let you know.

2183
02:04:43,069 --> 02:04:45,470
SAM: And if you ever need more dogs?

2184
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:47,014
LAURA: You're the man to call.

2185
02:04:47,014 --> 02:04:48,933
TALIESIN: I see Doty appear, correct?

2186
02:04:48,933 --> 02:04:49,941
MATT: Yeah.

2187
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:54,514
TALIESIN: Doty, they're going to take our things.
I know why you're here.

2188
02:04:54,514 --> 02:04:55,965
MATT: He just walks past you.

2189
02:04:55,965 --> 02:04:59,003
(laughter)

2190
02:04:59,003 --> 02:05:00,608
MATT: Enters the room.

2191
02:05:00,608 --> 02:05:03,021
TALIESIN: Are our things even in our room
anymore?

2192
02:05:03,021 --> 02:05:11,004
MATT: Your things are being brought out in pieces,
but the two employees see Doty enter and set them

2193
02:05:11,004 --> 02:05:17,120
down and Doty starts picking things up and dusts
them off. Starts picking

2194
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,609
up the piles of dog feces.

2195
02:05:19,609 --> 02:05:21,207
TALIESIN: Tary, call him off.

2196
02:05:21,207 --> 02:05:22,997
SAM: Sorry?

2197
02:05:22,997 --> 02:05:23,925
TALIESIN: Call him off.

2198
02:05:23,925 --> 02:05:26,159
SAM: I'm sorry? Call him off?

2199
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:27,334
TALIESIN: Call him off.

2200
02:05:27,334 --> 02:05:28,610
SAM: He's cleaning your things.

2201
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:30,603
TALIESIN: No. We're getting another room.

2202
02:05:30,603 --> 02:05:32,350
MARISHA: What is he throwing away?

2203
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:37,485
MATT: He's throwing the dung out onto the beach.
Starts heading back.

2204
02:05:37,485 --> 02:05:39,583
SAM: I should have been more specific.

2205
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:41,660
MARISHA: I don't think he's very sanitary.

2206
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:42,891
SAM: This is my earring, by the way.

2207
02:05:42,891 --> 02:05:44,055
TALIESIN: I know.

2208
02:05:44,055 --> 02:05:49,090
SAM: This is how I have to talk with it. I have to
dangle it.

2209
02:05:49,090 --> 02:05:53,724
TALIESIN: I know you have to fiddle your dangle.
I'm well aware.

2210
02:05:53,724 --> 02:05:57,486
SAM: All right, I'll be right there to give him
more specific instructions.

2211
02:05:57,486 --> 02:05:59,571
TALIESIN: We're going to sleep.

2212
02:05:59,571 --> 02:06:00,956
SAM: I'm coming.

2213
02:06:00,956 --> 02:06:06,172
LIAM: Do you improve the reception by moving it
around?

2214
02:06:06,172 --> 02:06:10,453
MATT: Okay. Over the course of the evening, the
room gets cleaned as best as it can.

2215
02:06:10,453 --> 02:06:14,381
TALIESIN: We do not tell them what our new room
number is.

2216
02:06:14,381 --> 02:06:22,440
MATT: You guys, from that point being the most
contentious, but you manage to enjoy the rest of

2217
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:29,032
your stay here in the Bay of Gifts. You enjoy a
nice, well-earned vacation, some of you plotting

2218
02:06:29,032 --> 02:06:36,935
the next stage in your vengeance, whenever that
may occur. Boarding your ship back, making your

2219
02:06:36,935 --> 02:06:42,987
way to your home in Tal'Dorei, across back to
Whitestone proper to finish the remainder of your

2220
02:06:43,036 --> 02:06:48,723
year's journey. We're going to take a break.
Before I go, real fast, letting you guys know, we

2221
02:06:48,723 --> 02:06:55,673
have another giveaway tonight. This is a nice
purple heart Wyrmwood mini holder,

2222
02:06:55,673 --> 02:06:56,884
which is pretty rad.

2223
02:06:56,884 --> 02:06:58,058
SAM: Is that what I have?

2224
02:06:58,058 --> 02:06:59,005
MATT: Yeah.

2225
02:06:59,005 --> 02:07:05,233
SAM: I love it. Honestly, this is the best color.
It's so cool. It's kinda like rose gold, therefore

2226
02:07:05,233 --> 02:07:06,402
it's the best.

2227
02:07:06,402 --> 02:07:08,283
(laughter)

2228
02:07:08,283 --> 02:07:12,388
MATT: There you go. Yeah, so this is going to go
to one of you lucky winners in the chat. The code

2229
02:07:12,388 --> 02:07:19,405
word for tonight is Momocon. M-O-M-O-C-O-N. So
go ahead and we'll do that over the break.

2230
02:07:19,405 --> 02:07:21,520
Enjoy Liam's episode of Signal Boost.

2231
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:23,336
ASHLEY: It's so good!

2232
02:07:23,336 --> 02:07:30,698
LIAM: Man, that was pure Dungeons and Dragons. I
took a little pebble and dropped it and it turned

2233
02:07:30,698 --> 02:07:33,635
into a frigging avalanche on the side of Everest.

2234
02:07:33,635 --> 02:07:36,152
TALIESIN: That reminded me of the old home games
quite a bit.

2235
02:07:36,152 --> 02:07:43,742
MATT: I wasn't expecting that to become our beach
episode, but it did! (laughs) All right, guys,

2236
02:07:43,742 --> 02:07:45,591
we'll see you here in a little bit.

2237
02:07:45,591 --> 02:24:37,385
[break]

2238
02:24:37,442 --> 02:24:40,471
MATT: Welcome back, everybody, to Critical Role.

2239
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:42,893
(laughter)

2240
02:24:42,893 --> 02:24:47,280
MATT: First and foremost, our winner in the chat
room goes by the name of Makelovelikewar,

2241
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:53,857
congratulations! Congratulations. You won the box.
We've all signed it, and it'll be coming to you in

2242
02:24:53,857 --> 02:24:58,262
the near future. Make sure to contact the folks
who run the chat here, and they'll get your

2243
02:24:58,330 --> 02:25:07,570
information, and well done. All righty, so.
Bringing us back in. You guys have been travelling

2244
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:14,789
across the Silvercut Roadway, through the dividing
plains of Tal'Dorei, onwards to the Alabaster

2245
02:25:14,789 --> 02:25:22,102
Sierras, and eventually to the homestead of
Whitestone. You guys have made your way back.

2246
02:25:22,102 --> 02:25:24,439
MARISHA: We catch up on so much gossip.

2247
02:25:24,439 --> 02:25:29,667
MATT: (laughs) So you arrive. What do you want to
do?

2248
02:25:29,667 --> 02:25:36,941
TRAVIS: Well, actually, now that we're home, I
would like to try and find Pike once we're in and

2249
02:25:36,941 --> 02:25:38,040
settled.

2250
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:41,851
MATT: So you guys all get settled and you find
your way to your rooms. The afternoon comes to a

2251
02:25:41,851 --> 02:25:46,246
close for the evening, and everyone's gone off to
do their business and prepare for a dinner, we'll

2252
02:25:46,246 --> 02:25:47,470
say, in about an hour.

2253
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:50,597
TRAVIS: Cool. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry.

2254
02:25:50,597 --> 02:25:52,934
ASHLEY: Hello?

2255
02:25:52,934 --> 02:25:54,454
TRAVIS: Hey, it's Grog.

2256
02:25:54,454 --> 02:25:57,600
ASHLEY: Oh, come in!

2257
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,877
TRAVIS: Huh, what?

2258
02:25:58,877 --> 02:26:00,145
ASHLEY: Okay.

2259
02:26:00,145 --> 02:26:01,705
(laughter)

2260
02:26:01,705 --> 02:26:02,708
ASHLEY: Hi, Grog.

2261
02:26:02,708 --> 02:26:08,289
TRAVIS: Hi! Hey. Hey. Hey. So, can I shut the
door? So I--

2262
02:26:08,289 --> 02:26:09,426
ASHLEY: Yes?

2263
02:26:09,426 --> 02:26:12,009
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. I shut the door. So, I have a
secret.

2264
02:26:12,009 --> 02:26:12,890
ASHLEY: Ooh?

2265
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:14,055
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2266
02:26:14,055 --> 02:26:15,443
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2267
02:26:15,443 --> 02:26:24,738
TRAVIS: Okay, so. When we beat Thordak, I was
rummaging around and all of Emon's treasures were

2268
02:26:24,738 --> 02:26:30,875
in this one place and everybody was like, "Meh, we
want to heal," and I found these little gifts, and

2269
02:26:30,875 --> 02:26:34,511
one of them was this little itty-bitty deck of
cards.

2270
02:26:34,511 --> 02:26:35,971
ASHLEY: (gasps)

2271
02:26:35,971 --> 02:26:40,495
TRAVIS: I know, right? Now, here's the thing. It
was in a really pretty box: wooden box with gold

2272
02:26:40,495 --> 02:26:43,863
all over it. I tried to open it, and it wouldn't,
so I smashed it.

2273
02:26:43,863 --> 02:26:44,930
ASHLEY: Naturally.

2274
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:46,064
TRAVIS: Like you do.

2275
02:26:46,064 --> 02:26:46,861
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2276
02:26:46,861 --> 02:26:54,012
TRAVIS: And I took it out. And I drew a card from
it, and this magic sword appeared in my hand.

2277
02:26:54,012 --> 02:26:57,563
ASHLEY: (gasps) So something magic comes out of it
when you pick one? Can I pick one?

2278
02:26:57,563 --> 02:26:58,834
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you want to?

2279
02:26:58,834 --> 02:26:59,979
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2280
02:26:59,979 --> 02:27:05,825
TRAVIS: Yeah. So I also went and I was journeying
around. I went to Vasselheim. Now, here's the

2281
02:27:05,825 --> 02:27:13,264
thing. Vex was like, "No, don't pick one, it's
dangerous. Mm."

2282
02:27:13,264 --> 02:27:15,237
ASHLEY: Wait, it can be dangerous?

2283
02:27:15,237 --> 02:27:20,514
TRAVIS: Well, no. She's afraid that it's
dangerous, right? Because the sword, it turned to

2284
02:27:20,514 --> 02:27:23,732
rust, and I got a headache afterwards. Whatever.

2285
02:27:23,732 --> 02:27:25,279
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh.

2286
02:27:25,279 --> 02:27:30,321
TRAVIS: But I think I didn't handle it right. But
I went to Vasselheim, and I had this other guy

2287
02:27:30,321 --> 02:27:31,618
pick a card. You know?

2288
02:27:31,618 --> 02:27:32,568
ASHLEY: Okay.

2289
02:27:32,568 --> 02:27:35,362
TRAVIS: And he picked a card. He got two Wishes.

2290
02:27:35,362 --> 02:27:36,809
ASHLEY: What!

2291
02:27:36,809 --> 02:27:38,714
TRAVIS: Just like that! And he made himself--

2292
02:27:38,714 --> 02:27:40,449
ASHLEY: That sounds like the best thing ever.

2293
02:27:40,449 --> 02:27:44,806
TRAVIS: I know! He's the Lord of the Crossroads.

2294
02:27:44,874 --> 02:27:45,985
ASHLEY: The Crossroads.

2295
02:27:45,985 --> 02:27:46,920
TRAVIS: Yep.

2296
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:48,007
ASHLEY: (gasps)

2297
02:27:48,007 --> 02:27:50,852
TRAVIS: He's rich; he had a servant who appeared
out of nowhere. All of a sudden he had fuckin'

2298
02:27:50,852 --> 02:27:52,299
dope-ass threads.

2299
02:27:52,299 --> 02:27:56,737
ASHLEY: Should we-- Whoa. Should we pick a card?

2300
02:27:56,737 --> 02:28:01,225
TRAVIS: I mean, I feel like we should. I've seen
nothing but good things happen.

2301
02:28:01,225 --> 02:28:04,147
(laughter)

2302
02:28:04,147 --> 02:28:07,080
ASHLEY: Wait, what do you mean this sword gave you
a headache, Grog?

2303
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:10,557
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know. So it was a magic
sword, right? I was going to be able to throw it

2304
02:28:10,557 --> 02:28:14,456
and it would fight without me. Like it would just
fight things that I told it to.

2305
02:28:14,456 --> 02:28:15,900
ASHLEY: Was it evil?

2306
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:18,241
TRAVIS: No! I tried talking to it and it didn't
say anything.

2307
02:28:18,241 --> 02:28:19,412
ASHLEY: Okay, that's a--

2308
02:28:19,412 --> 02:28:20,858
TRAVIS: We have a history.

2309
02:28:20,858 --> 02:28:22,026
ASHLEY: That's a red flag.

2310
02:28:22,026 --> 02:28:24,193
TRAVIS: I know. I have a history of, you know.

2311
02:28:24,193 --> 02:28:25,432
ASHLEY: So it didn't talk back to you.

2312
02:28:25,432 --> 02:28:26,265
TRAVIS: Nope.

2313
02:28:26,265 --> 02:28:27,015
ASHLEY: It fought on its own.

2314
02:28:27,015 --> 02:28:27,692
TRAVIS: Yep.

2315
02:28:27,692 --> 02:28:30,197
ASHLEY: A guy that you met, you made him just rich
and amazing.

2316
02:28:30,197 --> 02:28:34,867
TRAVIS: Yeah. Pretty much. I think it's a Deck of
Fortunate Things.

2317
02:28:34,867 --> 02:28:36,925
ASHLEY: A Deck of Fortune?

2318
02:28:36,925 --> 02:28:43,478
TRAVIS: I think so. I mean, I haven't really
looked at it too closely. Do you want to look at

2319
02:28:43,478 --> 02:28:45,754
it with your knowledge?

2320
02:28:45,754 --> 02:28:48,021
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't, yeah.

2321
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:48,814
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2322
02:28:48,814 --> 02:28:50,640
ASHLEY: I don't know if I have the knowledge, but
I'll look at it.

2323
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:51,800
TRAVIS: All right. I give her the deck.

2324
02:28:51,800 --> 02:29:03,370
MATT: All right, make an arcana check.

2325
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:05,356
(gasping)

2326
02:29:05,356 --> 02:29:06,921
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2327
02:29:06,921 --> 02:29:11,106
(cheering)

2328
02:29:11,106 --> 02:29:16,963
MATT: But what's your skill? What's your skill
bonus?

2329
02:29:16,963 --> 02:29:20,810
ASHLEY: Plus one. So 21.

2330
02:29:20,810 --> 02:29:31,066
MATT: Okay, you take the small sack that contains
the cards, and you pull the deck out of it, and

2331
02:29:31,066 --> 02:29:42,077
you inspect it from the outside. Just checking the
inscriptions. You've heard things about magical

2332
02:29:42,077 --> 02:29:46,900
decks of cards. Sometimes they're used to see the
future. Sometimes they're used for different types

2333
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:56,731
of augury and divination. You might've heard a
myth or two about a card deck that can alter

2334
02:29:56,731 --> 02:30:02,449
reality in good and bad ways. That's as much as
you are able to glean from this.

2335
02:30:02,449 --> 02:30:06,225
ASHLEY: Can I tell which cards are good and which
cards are bad?

2336
02:30:06,225 --> 02:30:08,048
MATT: No.

2337
02:30:08,048 --> 02:30:11,240
ASHLEY: I was just checking.

2338
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:13,059
(laughter)

2339
02:30:13,059 --> 02:30:14,296
ASHLEY: I figured the answer would be 'no'.

2340
02:30:14,296 --> 02:30:18,692
MATT: But you do know from looking at this, while
the name doesn't come to you, you're able to

2341
02:30:18,765 --> 02:30:24,290
ascertain this seems to be very, very in line with
the fate-altering deck of cards, the one you've

2342
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:28,978
heard can do good and bad, and is as powerful and
dangerous as it is interesting.

2343
02:30:28,978 --> 02:30:37,642
ASHLEY: I feel like I've heard of something like
this before.

2344
02:30:37,642 --> 02:30:39,064
TRAVIS: Really?

2345
02:30:39,064 --> 02:30:46,590
ASHLEY: But sometimes you can choose a card that
will do very bad things.

2346
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:48,669
TRAVIS: Oh.

2347
02:30:48,669 --> 02:30:57,586
ASHLEY: So it's like a 50/50 chance that you could
get something very good. Like, you have your

2348
02:30:57,586 --> 02:31:00,120
fortune change, you become a king, all of this
thing--

2349
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:02,651
TRAVIS: Or you make a bad person a king?

2350
02:31:02,651 --> 02:31:06,463
ASHLEY: Or you get a magical sword. Or if maybe
someone-- you could just die instantly.

2351
02:31:06,463 --> 02:31:07,960
TRAVIS: Really?

2352
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:10,501
ASHLEY: I don't know, maybe. Something along those
lines.

2353
02:31:10,501 --> 02:31:15,665
TRAVIS: But we're good people, so good things
would happen to us.

2354
02:31:15,665 --> 02:31:18,240
ASHLEY: (strained) Oh, it just sounds so fun
though.

2355
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:24,668
TRAVIS: I know, right? And think about my previous
experience. There is nothing bad that has happened

2356
02:31:24,668 --> 02:31:26,716
in what I've seen so far.

2357
02:31:26,716 --> 02:31:28,406
LAURA: (laughs) Oh god.

2358
02:31:28,406 --> 02:31:33,980
ASHLEY: (strained) Oh, I don't know what to do.
Well, do you want to pull one or should I pull

2359
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:36,994
one? Or should we not?

2360
02:31:36,994 --> 02:31:44,277
TRAVIS: I don't know. I mean, like, I kind of want
to. I mean, so like. Like bad things.

2361
02:31:44,277 --> 02:31:50,431
ASHLEY: What could be that bad? I mean, if someone
were to die, we could do a Resurrection spell.

2362
02:31:50,431 --> 02:31:57,773
TRAVIS: How could it just outright kill you? Well
if you die, I can't do a spell.

2363
02:31:57,773 --> 02:32:07,255
ASHLEY: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I don't
know if we should. I don't know if we should test

2364
02:32:07,255 --> 02:32:08,244
the fates.

2365
02:32:08,244 --> 02:32:09,702
TRAVIS: We should flip a coin.

2366
02:32:09,702 --> 02:32:10,710
ASHLEY: Let's flip a coin.

2367
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,648
TRAVIS: Okay. Do you have a coin?

2368
02:32:11,648 --> 02:32:13,183
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a coin.

2369
02:32:13,183 --> 02:32:15,205
TRAVIS: Oh, you do? That was lucky.

2370
02:32:15,205 --> 02:32:19,115
MATT: All right. Did you--

2371
02:32:19,115 --> 02:32:21,959
MARISHA: "We shouldn't test the fates, let's flip
a coin."

2372
02:32:21,959 --> 02:32:24,446
(laughter)

2373
02:32:24,446 --> 02:32:25,980
MATT: Do you want me to flip a coin for you?

2374
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:26,987
LIAM: You can roll a 20.

2375
02:32:26,987 --> 02:32:28,892
LAURA: Oh yeah, no. We have coins.

2376
02:32:28,892 --> 02:32:32,434
MARISHA: I've got one on hand right now, beotches.

2377
02:32:32,434 --> 02:32:34,255
TRAVIS: Do you want to?

2378
02:32:34,255 --> 02:32:36,510
MATT: It's up to you guys. This is entirely your
call.

2379
02:32:36,510 --> 02:32:39,036
MARISHA: Here it is.

2380
02:32:39,036 --> 02:32:41,008
LAURA: Oh, Melora.

2381
02:32:41,008 --> 02:32:42,246
LIAM: Coming in.

2382
02:32:42,246 --> 02:32:43,713
LAURA: There you go.

2383
02:32:43,713 --> 02:32:44,818
ASHLEY: Okay.

2384
02:32:44,818 --> 02:32:47,234
TRAVIS: What if all the good ones are gone?

2385
02:32:47,234 --> 02:32:55,296
ASHLEY: Heads or tails. Okay, so one is heads.

2386
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:59,237
TRAVIS: Heads, because that's all bad in the
heads. But the tail is the booty, so.

2387
02:32:59,291 --> 02:33:00,357
ASHLEY: Okay.

2388
02:33:00,357 --> 02:33:01,802
LAURA: Wait, but what is what?

2389
02:33:01,802 --> 02:33:06,827
ASHLEY: So what's what? 20, we pick a card. One,
we do not.

2390
02:33:06,827 --> 02:33:08,352
LIAM: 20, we don't pick a card.

2391
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:09,369
ASHLEY: 20, we don't pick a card.

2392
02:33:09,369 --> 02:33:11,118
LIAM: 20 is sensible. One is ridiculous.

2393
02:33:11,118 --> 02:33:12,693
ASHLEY: You are not here.

2394
02:33:12,693 --> 02:33:21,923
TRAVIS: Yeah, what do you feel like? What do you
feel like? One, we pick a card. 20, we don't-- we

2395
02:33:21,923 --> 02:33:23,013
do pick a card.

2396
02:33:23,013 --> 02:33:24,767
(laughter)

2397
02:33:24,767 --> 02:33:27,672
ASHLEY: That's both of those. You said we'd pick a
card both sides.

2398
02:33:27,672 --> 02:33:30,138
TRAVIS: That was a Fraudidean slip.

2399
02:33:30,138 --> 02:33:31,341
(laughter)

2400
02:33:31,341 --> 02:33:35,279
ASHLEY: Yeah. One, we pick a card. 20, we don't.

2401
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:36,181
TRAVIS: Okay.

2402
02:33:36,181 --> 02:33:37,580
ASHLEY: Who picks the card? Or should we--

2403
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:39,044
TRAVIS: We should flip for that too.

2404
02:33:39,044 --> 02:33:44,336
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, I'm going to check it. Oh, we
don't pick a card.

2405
02:33:44,336 --> 02:33:49,699
TRAVIS: But that was for you, you flipped. And now
I flip.

2406
02:33:49,699 --> 02:33:57,843
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh. You don't pick a card either.
You know what? It's safer this way.

2407
02:33:57,843 --> 02:33:59,470
TRAVIS: It is?

2408
02:33:59,470 --> 02:34:03,259
ASHLEY: I think so. Because what if we would've
gotten something bad? Did you want me to hold onto

2409
02:34:03,259 --> 02:34:08,263
it? Or do you want to hold onto it? I'm just
afraid you're going to pick it and be alone.

2410
02:34:08,263 --> 02:34:09,421
TRAVIS: I might.

2411
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:13,173
(laughter)

2412
02:34:13,173 --> 02:34:17,840
TRAVIS: No, I want it. I really want it. It's real
important to me.

2413
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:21,425
ASHLEY: Do not. Pick it. Alone.

2414
02:34:21,425 --> 02:34:23,011
TRAVIS: I've made this promise before.

2415
02:34:23,011 --> 02:34:25,959
(laughter)

2416
02:34:25,959 --> 02:34:27,965
ASHLEY: Who did you make the promise to?

2417
02:34:27,965 --> 02:34:29,166
TRAVIS: Vex.

2418
02:34:29,166 --> 02:34:32,902
ASHLEY: Well, you live your life how you want
to--

2419
02:34:32,902 --> 02:34:36,552
TRAVIS: Oh. Ooh. No, your promise was different.
You said 'alone' so if I was like really,

2420
02:34:36,552 --> 02:34:38,462
(distressed noise) I need to, I come to you--

2421
02:34:38,462 --> 02:34:39,299
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2422
02:34:39,299 --> 02:34:40,176
TRAVIS: And we pick it.

2423
02:34:40,176 --> 02:34:40,780
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2424
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:41,583
TRAVIS: Okay. Deal.

2425
02:34:41,583 --> 02:34:42,740
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

2426
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:46,793
TRAVIS: Thanks. You're sure you don't want to
just, like, slide one out

2427
02:34:46,908 --> 02:34:48,236
and just take a look at it?

2428
02:34:48,236 --> 02:34:49,399
ASHLEY: Just take a peek?

2429
02:34:49,399 --> 02:34:51,157
TRAVIS: Yep. All right, fine.

2430
02:34:51,157 --> 02:34:52,832
(laughter)

2431
02:34:52,832 --> 02:34:54,582
ASHLEY: (strained) I want to so bad.

2432
02:34:54,582 --> 02:34:56,471
TRAVIS: All right.

2433
02:34:56,471 --> 02:35:00,773
LAURA: That is fate. Helping us.

2434
02:35:00,773 --> 02:35:02,124
ASHLEY: I know.

2435
02:35:02,124 --> 02:35:04,833
TALIESIN: That was like watching an
eight-year-old juggle a gun.

2436
02:35:04,833 --> 02:35:07,939
(laughter)

2437
02:35:07,939 --> 02:35:10,432
LAURA: Was that another 20?

2438
02:35:10,432 --> 02:35:11,263
TRAVIS: Yes.

2439
02:35:11,263 --> 02:35:21,361
(laughter)

2440
02:35:21,361 --> 02:35:22,959
LIAM: They both want to do it so bad.

2441
02:35:22,959 --> 02:35:24,651
MATT: I know.

2442
02:35:24,651 --> 02:35:27,207
MARISHA: Moving on from that scene before they
change their mind.

2443
02:35:27,207 --> 02:35:37,381
MATT: We'll say for the point of the narrative, a
couple of weeks go by, relatively unimpactful.

2444
02:35:37,381 --> 02:35:38,825
LAURA: Oh, I get my circle!

2445
02:35:38,825 --> 02:35:41,204
MATT: Yeah, the Teleportation Circle is complete.

2446
02:35:41,204 --> 02:35:45,465
LAURA: Hey, guys. We can go to Syngorn whenever we
want.

2447
02:35:45,465 --> 02:35:47,021
MARISHA: Oh, rad.

2448
02:35:47,021 --> 02:35:48,187
LAURA: Tight, right?

2449
02:35:48,187 --> 02:35:49,836
LIAM: The question is, do we want to?

2450
02:35:49,836 --> 02:35:51,054
LAURA: Probably not!

2451
02:35:51,054 --> 02:35:53,315
MARISHA: Can I go check in with the Sun Tree while
I'm here?

2452
02:35:53,315 --> 02:36:01,482
MATT: Yeah, sure. So you walk on down to the
center of Whitestone, which is now far more full

2453
02:36:01,482 --> 02:36:08,889
of life and bustling. A lot of the buildings that
line the square have little flower boxes

2454
02:36:08,889 --> 02:36:14,694
underneath the windows. Color has returned to it.
Still keeps moody gray skies a large portion of

2455
02:36:14,694 --> 02:36:19,214
the day, but overall the city itself seems to have
sprung into life over the past year or so. The Sun

2456
02:36:19,214 --> 02:36:28,646
Tree is beautiful. It's still a vastly
bark-visible tree. It has that orange-brown color

2457
02:36:28,646 --> 02:36:36,357
across it, smooth in most places, a little more
textured toward the bottom, but you see the very

2458
02:36:36,357 --> 02:36:43,986
lush green leaves up into the boughs. You can see
little bits of white flowers that year-round

2459
02:36:43,986 --> 02:36:48,445
reside up in the top. It stands there before you
in all of its magnificence.

2460
02:36:48,445 --> 02:36:53,760
MARISHA: I come up and say, hey, Sun Tree. Casting
Speak With Plants, of course.

2461
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:56,892
MATT: "Hey, Keyleth."

2462
02:36:56,892 --> 02:36:58,122
MARISHA: Hey!

2463
02:36:58,122 --> 02:36:59,282
MATT: "It's been a while."

2464
02:36:59,282 --> 02:37:02,496
MARISHA: It's been so long. You're looking so
good. So healthy.

2465
02:37:02,496 --> 02:37:04,403
MATT: "Thanks. I've been eating right."

2466
02:37:04,403 --> 02:37:07,444
MARISHA: Yeah? Have you been working out?

2467
02:37:07,444 --> 02:37:10,811
MATT: "As much as I can. You know, I'm a tree."

2468
02:37:10,811 --> 02:37:17,019
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah. How's it been? Whitestone
seems so much better. Seems happier. Has morale

2469
02:37:17,019 --> 02:37:18,112
been up?

2470
02:37:18,112 --> 02:37:20,054
MATT: "I mean, yeah."

2471
02:37:20,054 --> 02:37:21,123
MARISHA: Yeah?

2472
02:37:21,123 --> 02:37:23,482
MATT: "There's kids and stuff."

2473
02:37:23,482 --> 02:37:27,004
MARISHA: Yeah? Do the kids sometimes climb in
you?

2474
02:37:27,004 --> 02:37:28,134
MATT: "Yeah."

2475
02:37:28,134 --> 02:37:29,697
MARISHA: Do you like that?

2476
02:37:29,697 --> 02:37:30,563
MATT: "No."

2477
02:37:30,563 --> 02:37:32,005
MARISHA: No? Oh, right.

2478
02:37:32,005 --> 02:37:33,239
MATT: "No, it's uncomfortable."

2479
02:37:33,239 --> 02:37:34,157
MARISHA: Really?

2480
02:37:34,157 --> 02:37:35,325
MATT: "Yeah."

2481
02:37:35,325 --> 02:37:39,308
MARISHA: Should I put a Do Not Climb sign on you?
Would you like that?

2482
02:37:39,308 --> 02:37:40,805
MATT: "Would you have to nail it into me?"

2483
02:37:40,805 --> 02:37:43,954
MARISHA: No. I could stake it in the ground around
you.

2484
02:37:43,954 --> 02:37:45,144
MATT: "It's fine."

2485
02:37:45,144 --> 02:37:45,985
MARISHA: Okay.

2486
02:37:45,985 --> 02:37:47,715
MATT: "But thank you. I appreciate the offer."

2487
02:37:47,715 --> 02:37:50,055
MARISHA: Anything to make you more comfortable,
man.

2488
02:37:50,055 --> 02:37:51,355
MATT: "Appreciate it."

2489
02:37:51,355 --> 02:37:52,454
MARISHA: Yeah.

2490
02:37:52,454 --> 02:37:53,649
MATT: "You're great."

2491
02:37:53,649 --> 02:38:00,324
MARISHA: Oh, thanks. Anyway, is there anything
else that you need? Any new news?

2492
02:38:00,324 --> 02:38:01,866
Anything going on?

2493
02:38:01,866 --> 02:38:10,392
MATT: "Nah. Glad the snowing stopped."

2494
02:38:10,392 --> 02:38:14,866
MARISHA: Right? Thought that winter would last
forever, right?

2495
02:38:14,866 --> 02:38:17,470
MATT: "It's hard to keep these blossoms up through
the winter, let me tell you."

2496
02:38:17,470 --> 02:38:20,685
MARISHA: Oh, yeah? But you're still good.

2497
02:38:20,685 --> 02:38:26,274
MATT: "Yeah. How are you doing, Kiki?"

2498
02:38:26,274 --> 02:38:33,742
MARISHA: Oh, you know. Keeping busy, keeping on
keeping on, you know? It's been good. You're like

2499
02:38:33,742 --> 02:38:40,004
the coolest person I know, and you're a tree. It's
weird. Even after a year, it's like talking to an

2500
02:38:40,004 --> 02:38:41,880
old friend. It's good.

2501
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:43,206
MATT: "If I could blush."

2502
02:38:43,206 --> 02:38:46,086
(laughter)

2503
02:38:46,086 --> 02:38:50,865
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

2504
02:38:50,865 --> 02:38:57,543
MARISHA: Oh, look! Some of these flowers are
getting a little pink, Sun Tree.

2505
02:38:57,543 --> 02:39:06,674
MATT: "Don't point it out. It's embarrassing. So.
Hi."

2506
02:39:06,674 --> 02:39:12,687
MARISHA: No, that's all. It's actually getting a
little awkward now.

2507
02:39:12,687 --> 02:39:14,252
It's gone on for a little long.

2508
02:39:14,252 --> 02:39:16,637
MATT: "I'm glad you brought that up. I didn't want
to breach the subject."

2509
02:39:16,637 --> 02:39:18,364
MARISHA: I just wanted to make sure you were
cool.

2510
02:39:18,364 --> 02:39:19,383
MATT: "No, I'm cool."

2511
02:39:19,383 --> 02:39:25,468
MARISHA: Yeah. Awesome. Okay, I'll see you around.
Bye.

2512
02:39:25,468 --> 02:39:29,681
MATT: Hang up.

2513
02:39:29,681 --> 02:39:33,970
LAURA: It's going to be a while before you guys
call again.

2514
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:40,170
MARISHA: I'll wait for him to text me first. Yeah.
It's the rule. Long time.

2515
02:39:40,170 --> 02:39:47,936
TALIESIN: I don't know what they're looking at.

2516
02:39:47,936 --> 02:39:54,469
MATT: I don't know, either. Partway into the day,
we'll say that you've been doing this. The

2517
02:39:54,469 --> 02:40:02,031
bakery's been going fine. Which, actually, Pike
and Vex, you've been in the process of-- have you

2518
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:03,503
guys hired employees to run the bakery?

2519
02:40:03,503 --> 02:40:04,622
LAURA: Obviously.

2520
02:40:04,622 --> 02:40:06,558
MATT: Are you more playing as managers as opposed
to actual workers?

2521
02:40:06,558 --> 02:40:08,673
MARISHA: Owners.

2522
02:40:08,673 --> 02:40:10,133
LAURA: Creative input.

2523
02:40:10,133 --> 02:40:15,329
MATT: Pike, on this day, you've been keeping tabs
on this. A couple of the Pale Guard approach the

2524
02:40:15,329 --> 02:40:19,292
bakery. One of them, without seeing you, walks in
and goes,

2525
02:40:19,292 --> 02:40:24,606
"We're looking for Pike. Is Miss Pike in?"

2526
02:40:24,606 --> 02:40:26,510
ASHLEY: Yes?

2527
02:40:26,510 --> 02:40:31,522
MATT: "Could you please come with us? There's
somebody on the border requesting your presence."

2528
02:40:31,522 --> 02:40:33,362
ASHLEY: Where?

2529
02:40:33,362 --> 02:40:35,684
MATT: "On the outskirts of Whitestone."

2530
02:40:35,684 --> 02:40:39,204
ASHLEY: Okay. Yes.

2531
02:40:39,204 --> 02:40:43,525
MATT: "Someone who says they know you. You'd
better come with us."

2532
02:40:43,525 --> 02:40:45,644
ASHLEY: Okay.

2533
02:40:45,644 --> 02:40:49,379
MATT: The two guards step back and-- do you walk
with them?

2534
02:40:49,379 --> 02:40:51,441
ASHLEY: Yes.

2535
02:40:51,441 --> 02:40:53,264
LAURA: Are any of us with you?

2536
02:40:53,264 --> 02:40:54,758
MATT: It's just her, at the moment.

2537
02:40:54,758 --> 02:40:59,804
MARISHA: Does she walk past the Sun Tree when I'm
having a random conversation with no one?

2538
02:40:59,804 --> 02:41:02,404
MATT: Make a perception check.

2539
02:41:02,404 --> 02:41:10,579
MARISHA: Rolling really shitty tonight. Let's see
what happens. Oh, that's good! That's much better.

2540
02:41:10,579 --> 02:41:16,968
Straight perception? 30.

2541
02:41:16,968 --> 02:41:22,865
MATT: Okay. As you're walking away from the Sun
Tree and begin heading back to the northern side

2542
02:41:22,865 --> 02:41:27,396
of Whitestone, glancing back at him. "Oh, it's
good to talk to him again." And you see Pike

2543
02:41:27,465 --> 02:41:36,312
walking with two guards just on the southwestern
side of the square. She looks a little nervous.

2544
02:41:36,312 --> 02:41:46,599
MARISHA: It's about that time I'm like, okay, bye,
Sun Tree. And then I'm going to Beast Shape into a

2545
02:41:46,599 --> 02:41:50,937
crow and start circling her.

2546
02:41:50,937 --> 02:41:56,576
MATT: There are two kids off to the side that were
just playing who look over and go, "Whoa."

2547
02:41:56,576 --> 02:41:59,068
LAURA: That was amazing!

2548
02:41:59,068 --> 02:42:00,536
ASHLEY: That was awesome!

2549
02:42:00,536 --> 02:42:01,797
MATT: "I want to do that!"

2550
02:42:01,797 --> 02:42:03,212
MARISHA: Poop on the way up.

2551
02:42:03,212 --> 02:42:05,374
LAURA: That was even cooler!

2552
02:42:05,374 --> 02:42:13,687
MATT: They did not see that. So, as you're brought
to the western road, it leads you alongside the

2553
02:42:13,687 --> 02:42:20,666
shops and one of the guard who's talking to you is
like, "Yeah, sorry. A group of folks have been

2554
02:42:20,666 --> 02:42:28,186
"here for a couple of days asking-- a few hours, I
should say. Not a couple of days. Asking about

2555
02:42:28,186 --> 02:42:32,619
"you. We've kept an eye on them. They don't seem to
be aggressive, but they asked for you recently,

2556
02:42:32,619 --> 02:42:39,816
"and we managed to find you by the bakery. Here
they are." They lead you to the outside of the

2557
02:42:39,816 --> 02:42:50,838
town, and there you see a small carriage with two
horses that are currently hitched up front. You

2558
02:42:50,838 --> 02:42:55,505
see about three other Pale Guard in full armor.
One of them is in the middle of conversation with

2559
02:42:55,505 --> 02:43:01,266
a couple of figures. You see four figures. You see
three, and then a fourth one emerges from inside

2560
02:43:01,266 --> 02:43:06,205
the carriage. It's a topped carriage with what looks
to be some sort of curtains that are closed-- reds

2561
02:43:06,275 --> 02:43:10,373
and dark purples. It doesn't look like an
elaborate carriage, but it's functional.

2562
02:43:10,373 --> 02:43:21,259
You see a male gnome with short dark hair, slicked
to one side, and a well-groomed mustache that

2563
02:43:21,259 --> 02:43:24,968
curls at the end. He's in the middle of talking
when he glances over and sees you and goes, "Aha!

2564
02:43:24,968 --> 02:43:29,591
"She's here!" He leaps off the top and the guards
get defensive as he goes,

2565
02:43:29,591 --> 02:43:34,391
"Astra! Ogden! JB? She's here!"

2566
02:43:34,391 --> 02:43:38,230
Then he goes rushing off in your direction as the
guards are like, "Sir! Sir!"

2567
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:43,505
He ignores them for a second, and the two guards
with you say, "Miss Pike, should we?" And they go

2568
02:43:43,505 --> 02:43:44,628
for their blades.

2569
02:43:44,628 --> 02:43:46,206
ASHLEY: It's okay.

2570
02:43:46,206 --> 02:43:50,752
MATT: He approaches real fast and goes, (laughs)
and gives a big old hug and lifts you off the

2571
02:43:50,752 --> 02:43:59,759
ground, and it takes you a minute to realize, this
is Johann Trickfoot, your cousin who you haven't

2572
02:43:59,759 --> 02:44:09,546
seen in quite a long time. He's dressed in a fine
vest that is a dark maroon color with a gold trim.

2573
02:44:09,546 --> 02:44:16,257
A little ragged at the edges, but fine. Big,
swishy pants and boots, and he lifts you up for a

2574
02:44:16,257 --> 02:44:20,061
second and then sets you back down and is like,
"It's been quite a while."

2575
02:44:20,061 --> 02:44:25,535
ASHLEY: It's been so long. How did you know where
to find me?

2576
02:44:25,535 --> 02:44:31,068
MATT: "Well, we got your letter! And we've been
hearing all about you-- at least, JB's been

2577
02:44:31,068 --> 02:44:34,025
"telling us all about you, hasn't she?" And he
looks around and you

2578
02:44:34,025 --> 02:44:35,943
see the other figures as they approach.

2579
02:44:35,943 --> 02:44:45,283
There's a female gnome, older than you, who you
haven't met before, who has curly

2580
02:44:45,283 --> 02:44:53,077
strawberry-blonde hair that goes just past her
shoulders. She's wearing this very revealing shirt

2581
02:44:53,077 --> 02:44:58,338
and seems to walk with a confidence and smile and
she goes, "Pike, my dear!

2582
02:44:58,338 --> 02:45:02,136
"I've heard all about you!" And she rushes up and 
gives you a big hug as well.

2583
02:45:02,136 --> 02:45:10,232
You look back, and stepping off the carriage, you
see a very old gnome who is just a wreath of black

2584
02:45:10,232 --> 02:45:15,543
and salt-and-pepper hair, crazy, around him like a
lion's mane, and a giant beard. You wouldn't see a

2585
02:45:15,543 --> 02:45:19,530
face if not for these small spectacles and a
little button nose poking out as he's being helped

2586
02:45:19,530 --> 02:45:27,375
off the wagon by another female gnome that you
recognize as she turns around towards you. She has

2587
02:45:27,375 --> 02:45:32,438
long, straight black hair that goes right past her
shoulders. She has a Wednesday Addams vibe to her.

2588
02:45:32,438 --> 02:45:38,276
She looks back at you and smiles, and you can see
this gap in her front teeth. She's about your age.

2589
02:45:38,276 --> 02:45:42,672
This is JB Trickfoot. She is the--

2590
02:45:42,672 --> 02:45:44,845
MARISHA: JB?

2591
02:45:44,845 --> 02:45:48,981
MATT: JB. She's another one of your cousins. One
that you grew up with, actually, when you were

2592
02:45:48,981 --> 02:45:53,686
very young, but you haven't seen her in a very
long time. As they all begin to approach, this

2593
02:45:53,686 --> 02:46:01,488
small cluster of Trickfoots have approached. As JB
walks up to answer Johann, says, "Yes, indeed.

2594
02:46:01,488 --> 02:46:08,549
"We've heard all about you. I've been so proud to
hear that you've done such great good in the

2595
02:46:08,549 --> 02:46:10,380
"world, cousin."

2596
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:15,716
ASHLEY: I give her a hug. It's good to see you.
It's been a very long time.

2597
02:46:15,716 --> 02:46:17,402
MATT: "Far too long."

2598
02:46:17,402 --> 02:46:23,078
ASHLEY: Did you guys just come here to see me?

2599
02:46:23,078 --> 02:46:24,786
MATT: "Yes."

2600
02:46:24,786 --> 02:46:30,949
Johann claps his arm on the side of your shoulder.
"Yes, of course! It's been-- I can't even

2601
02:46:30,949 --> 02:46:37,931
"remember. Look at how big you are! Last I saw you,
you were waist-high to a knuckle-punch. It's been

2602
02:46:37,931 --> 02:46:43,278
"far too long. And so strong!" He's slapping the
side of your arm, and they're all doing the whole

2603
02:46:43,278 --> 02:46:47,790
family gathering, pulling and tugging, and you're
starting to feel uncomfortable from all the

2604
02:46:47,790 --> 02:46:53,177
attention, and the guards are all confused but
also mildly amused by this family gathering.

2605
02:46:53,177 --> 02:47:01,012
The old one now catches up, and you recognize that
this is your uncle Ogden Trickfoot, who is the

2606
02:47:01,012 --> 02:47:08,522
father to both Johann and JB. As he approaches, he
has this small walking cane and he's walking at an

2607
02:47:08,522 --> 02:47:13,209
angle because he doesn't quite see you. He's like,
"Are you sure that she's around?"

2608
02:47:13,209 --> 02:47:14,568
ASHLEY: I'm right here!

2609
02:47:14,568 --> 02:47:15,544
MATT: "Huh?"

2610
02:47:15,544 --> 02:47:16,642
ASHLEY: Hi.

2611
02:47:16,642 --> 02:47:18,198
MATT: "Ah. Yes."

2612
02:47:18,198 --> 02:47:19,132
ASHLEY: How are you?

2613
02:47:19,132 --> 02:47:22,384
MATT: "I'm all right. It's so good to see you."

2614
02:47:22,384 --> 02:47:24,009
ASHLEY: It's so wonderful to see you.

2615
02:47:24,009 --> 02:47:25,386
MATT: "There you are."

2616
02:47:25,386 --> 02:47:26,697
ASHLEY: I'm here.

2617
02:47:26,697 --> 02:47:31,838
MATT: He adjusts his head a little. "They tell me
that you slay dragons!"

2618
02:47:31,838 --> 02:47:37,395
ASHLEY: Yes, I did. With my friends.

2619
02:47:37,395 --> 02:47:38,838
MATT: "What?"

2620
02:47:38,838 --> 02:47:41,687
ASHLEY: Who I would love to introduce you guys to.
My friends?

2621
02:47:41,687 --> 02:47:44,059
MATT: "What did she say?"

2622
02:47:44,059 --> 02:47:45,627
ASHLEY: My friends!

2623
02:47:45,627 --> 02:47:48,140
MATT: JB's like, "She said yes. She's slayed
dragons."

2624
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:52,325
ASHLEY: I also--

2625
02:47:52,325 --> 02:47:53,408
MATT: "What?"

2626
02:47:53,408 --> 02:47:56,975
ASHLEY: I also have a bakery!

2627
02:47:56,975 --> 02:48:01,134
MATT: "She says a bakery?"

2628
02:48:01,134 --> 02:48:03,764
ASHLEY: It's called the Slayer's Cake!

2629
02:48:03,764 --> 02:48:11,959
MATT: "Cake?" Suddenly you see his face brighten.
Between the bursts of facial and head hair, you

2630
02:48:11,965 --> 02:48:17,243
see a little bit of rosy cheeks poke through with
a smile. JB goes, "We'll get you cake. We'll get

2631
02:48:17,243 --> 02:48:18,963
"you a cake, uncle."

2632
02:48:18,963 --> 02:48:27,996
ASHLEY: Come this way. I didn't realize you guys
would be coming, but I'm glad that you got my

2633
02:48:27,996 --> 02:48:30,483
letter and everything else.

2634
02:48:30,483 --> 02:48:37,165
MATT: At which point, the blonde one goes, "Yes,
of course we did. You are as beautiful as

2635
02:48:37,165 --> 02:48:42,179
"everything they told me. I'm Astra, by the way.
I'm Johann's wife. We haven't met, but you are a

2636
02:48:42,179 --> 02:48:46,864
"sight to see." She takes your hands and pulls your
hands and goes, "Oh my, and aren't you the

2637
02:48:46,864 --> 02:48:49,217
"strapping young lady. Who's the lucky man?"

2638
02:48:49,217 --> 02:48:55,045
ASHLEY: Oh. Well, no one right now.

2639
02:48:55,045 --> 02:49:02,159
MATT: "Oh. Shouldn't be a problem. Or woman.
Whatever, I don't know. You can tell me later."

2640
02:49:02,159 --> 02:49:08,983
ASHLEY: We'll discuss later, maybe, but do come
in. I would love to introduce you to some friends

2641
02:49:08,983 --> 02:49:12,583
of mine. Come into town.

2642
02:49:12,583 --> 02:49:16,076
MATT: JB's smile creeps, and you see the gap in
her teeth once more.

2643
02:49:16,076 --> 02:49:20,394
"Are these friends Vox Machina?"

2644
02:49:20,394 --> 02:49:24,977
ASHLEY: Yes.

2645
02:49:24,977 --> 02:49:35,292
MATT: At which point, they all look at her, and
she goes, "I'm so excited. Please?"

2646
02:49:35,292 --> 02:49:40,204
And they all gather around you, and the guard
comes up real fast.

2647
02:49:40,204 --> 02:49:43,619
"Miss, do you require assistance?"

2648
02:49:43,619 --> 02:49:51,527
ASHLEY: Just walk us into town. That would be
great. Just in case there's anything that might

2649
02:49:51,527 --> 02:49:53,007
jump out and get us.

2650
02:49:53,007 --> 02:49:59,590
MATT: "Very well." And the three guards that were
at the front shout out, "The carriage?"

2651
02:49:59,590 --> 02:50:08,003
And Johann goes, "Oh, yes! Well, it's now under
the watch of one Pike Trickfoot, so just put it

2652
02:50:08,003 --> 02:50:10,511
"wherever the royal horses go." (chuckles)

2653
02:50:10,511 --> 02:50:11,896
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2654
02:50:11,896 --> 02:50:15,381
LAURA: Oh, I don't like them at all.

2655
02:50:15,381 --> 02:50:20,343
LIAM: A cart of the Sackville-Bagginses just
rolled up.

2656
02:50:20,343 --> 02:50:34,906
ASHLEY: Let me-- you know what? Guards, can you
take them to the Slayer's Cake? And I will be

2657
02:50:34,906 --> 02:50:36,545
right there.

2658
02:50:36,545 --> 02:50:39,935
MATT: "Of course! You're a busy woman. Don't worry
about it."

2659
02:50:39,935 --> 02:50:48,140
Astra fluffs her hair a bit. "Besides, I can have
a guard escort me any day." The guard just grabs

2660
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:52,867
her arm and starts walking along with her. You can
already tell she's a bubbly flirt.

2661
02:50:52,867 --> 02:50:58,651
MARISHA: Keyleth flies down and lands on Pike's
shoulder.

2662
02:50:58,651 --> 02:51:12,006
ASHLEY: Hey. Okay, so you just saw that. My
family's here, the family I haven't really seen

2663
02:51:12,006 --> 02:51:24,416
since I was a kid, and they're-- we have the last
name Trickfoot for a reason. I'm going to get on

2664
02:51:24,416 --> 02:51:31,789
the earring and say, whoever is available, I would
love to maybe have you come to the Slayer's Cake.

2665
02:51:31,789 --> 02:51:36,567
Some of my family is here.

2666
02:51:36,567 --> 02:51:38,119
TRAVIS: (gasps, running noises)

2667
02:51:38,119 --> 02:51:47,907
ASHLEY: Hold on! Watch your pockets, watch your
stuff. Just keep an eye on your things. Yeah, just

2668
02:51:47,907 --> 02:51:50,542
please come?

2669
02:51:50,542 --> 02:51:52,579
LAURA: We've got you, darling.

2670
02:51:52,579 --> 02:51:58,759
MARISHA: I bamf out of my Beast Shape. Whoa!
What?

2671
02:51:58,759 --> 02:52:05,341
ASHLEY: Okay, I sent money. I didn't tell them
where I was.

2672
02:52:05,341 --> 02:52:06,927
MARISHA: You sent money?

2673
02:52:06,927 --> 02:52:12,705
ASHLEY: I did. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't
have done it. I just wanted to make sure that they

2674
02:52:12,705 --> 02:52:17,111
were okay. Maybe that wasn't a good idea.

2675
02:52:17,111 --> 02:52:21,222
MARISHA: You've told us very vague amounts about
your family.

2676
02:52:21,222 --> 02:52:22,845
ASHLEY: Because they're--

2677
02:52:22,845 --> 02:52:31,732
MARISHA: It was surprising. You haven't talked
about them too much, just that they're shady.

2678
02:52:31,732 --> 02:52:37,031
ASHLEY: I left when I was very young, so a lot of
them I don't really know. Okay.

2679
02:52:37,031 --> 02:52:46,666
MARISHA: You know, we love you, and family or not,
if anyone tries to fucking use you, we will--

2680
02:52:46,666 --> 02:52:49,837
ASHLEY: Thank you. Okay. I don't think it'll come
to that.

2681
02:52:49,837 --> 02:52:53,166
MARISHA: All right. I just don't want anyone
taking advantage of you.

2682
02:52:53,166 --> 02:52:54,789
ASHLEY: Right.

2683
02:52:54,789 --> 02:52:57,384
MATT: As you're having this conversation,
(thudding sounds)

2684
02:52:57,384 --> 02:53:01,894
TRAVIS: (shouting) Gnomes! (pants)

2685
02:53:01,894 --> 02:53:09,984
ASHLEY: Okay. Just get ready. Let's go to the
Slayer's Cake.

2686
02:53:09,984 --> 02:53:13,542
TALIESIN: I'm walking from the cemetery. However
far that is.

2687
02:53:13,542 --> 02:53:21,736
ASHLEY: They alluded to the fact that they know
who Vox Machina is, which I guess in this day and

2688
02:53:21,736 --> 02:53:30,477
age, people know who we are. Which is weird. Okay,
just be prepared, because it's not like I'm

2689
02:53:30,477 --> 02:53:36,751
embarrassed of my family or anything, I just--
they're great! I just don't really know them.

2690
02:53:36,751 --> 02:53:38,679
TRAVIS: You don't know them?

2691
02:53:38,679 --> 02:53:49,387
ASHLEY: Okay, Wilhand took me out of there when I
was six, so it's been a while.

2692
02:53:49,387 --> 02:53:53,217
MARISHA: Have you kept in contact with any of them
until recently?

2693
02:53:53,217 --> 02:54:03,728
ASHLEY: Not really? JB, my cousin who you'll meet in a
little bit, but not really. Not really at all.

2694
02:54:03,728 --> 02:54:05,492
TRAVIS: Yeah, they never came by Wilhand's.

2695
02:54:05,492 --> 02:54:10,423
ASHLEY: No, they have so many things to do.

2696
02:54:10,423 --> 02:54:13,928
TRAVIS: Busy. Important.

2697
02:54:13,928 --> 02:54:24,068
ASHLEY: Busy. But just hold onto your butts. Hold
onto your things. They are sneaky. Sneaky-sneaky.

2698
02:54:24,068 --> 02:54:32,047
They like to take things, and they're fast and
small and that little sleight-of-hand didn't get

2699
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:37,534
passed down to me, but-- oh, I'm so uncomfortable
right now!

2700
02:54:37,534 --> 02:54:39,761
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're sweating a lot.

2701
02:54:39,761 --> 02:54:45,098
MARISHA: Here. And I dab her brow off a little.

2702
02:54:45,098 --> 02:54:45,947
ASHLEY: Thanks.

2703
02:54:45,947 --> 02:54:50,160
MARISHA: Do you need anything? Do you need
anything to look cool?

2704
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:52,252
TRAVIS: Do you want some deodorant? You kind of
smell.

2705
02:54:52,252 --> 02:54:53,347
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2706
02:54:53,347 --> 02:55:00,141
MARISHA: Okay. I pull out my oils that I use on
Vax. Here you go. You're good. Much better.

2707
02:55:00,141 --> 02:55:01,975
LAURA: Have we caught up with them yet?

2708
02:55:01,975 --> 02:55:06,949
MATT: Yeah, they've been having this conversation
with them just standing in the square not far from

2709
02:55:06,949 --> 02:55:08,430
the Slayer's Cake.

2710
02:55:08,430 --> 02:55:11,468
TALIESIN: That's never going to get old.

2711
02:55:11,468 --> 02:55:16,457
MATT: It'll never get old. Yeah, so you've caught
up at this point. Percy, you've just started to

2712
02:55:16,457 --> 02:55:17,681
see them in the distance.

2713
02:55:17,681 --> 02:55:18,870
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm excited.

2714
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:20,072
MATT: Taryon, I don't know if you're--

2715
02:55:20,072 --> 02:55:22,662
SAM: I'm at the Slayer's Cake. I am making
blondies.

2716
02:55:22,662 --> 02:55:31,441
MATT: Okay. So, while you guys are having this
conversation, Taryon, you hear what sounds like

2717
02:55:31,441 --> 02:55:37,454
ruckus, laughter, conversation, voices
overlapping, getting louder and louder and then

2718
02:55:37,454 --> 02:55:43,452
suddenly the front door to the Slayer's Cake,
which has been quiet this afternoon, (thud). And

2719
02:55:43,452 --> 02:55:49,300
then, (laughs) "Oh! This place is amazing! Do you
smell that? You smell that, Uncle?"

2720
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:55,065
And you watch as the uncle comes in. (sniffs)
"Smells like rocks."

2721
02:55:55,137 --> 02:55:56,737
SAM: Rocks?

2722
02:55:56,737 --> 02:56:01,533
MATT: "He lost his smell when he was very-- it was
a terrible accident. Horse hoof in the face.

2723
02:56:01,533 --> 02:56:10,675
"Anyway, hi! We're family of Pike Trickfoot, and we
were told to come here and try your wares! So this

2724
02:56:10,675 --> 02:56:12,690
"is a bakery?"

2725
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:23,454
SAM: In Gnomish, welcome to the store. Any family
of Pike Trickfoot is family of mine. I am one of

2726
02:56:23,454 --> 02:56:29,694
her closest friends, Taryon Darrington. Here you
go. Blondies on the house for everyone to

2727
02:56:29,694 --> 02:56:33,190
celebrate your blondie, Pike Trickfoot.

2728
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:35,873
MATT: "She wasn't always blonde, you know."

2729
02:56:35,873 --> 02:56:39,089
SAM: Oh, I don't know that at all. What?

2730
02:56:39,089 --> 02:56:42,898
MATT: Yeah. I guess she wanted a change of pace.
She had dark hair when she was younger.

2731
02:56:42,898 --> 02:56:44,207
SAM: Really?

2732
02:56:44,207 --> 02:56:48,783
MATT: "Astra, free treats!" And they start
grabbing and filling their pockets with blondies

2733
02:56:48,783 --> 02:56:50,316
and eating them in between.

2734
02:56:50,316 --> 02:56:54,114
SAM: I've got more. Sure. You can take all you
want. Everything in the store is yours.

2735
02:56:54,114 --> 02:56:58,058
MATT: You watch as JB walks up with long, dark
hair, and goes,

2736
02:56:58,058 --> 02:57:00,151
"Do you happen to have any water?"

2737
02:57:00,151 --> 02:57:04,600
SAM: Of course! Doty, go fetch some water for
these fine gnomes.

2738
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:09,102
MATT: "Tary." Grabs and gets a small bucket of
water and sets it down. You watch as JB begins

2739
02:57:09,102 --> 02:57:13,550
breaking up the pastry and dipping it in the water
and then feeding it to the uncle.

2740
02:57:13,550 --> 02:57:14,919
SAM: Ugh.

2741
02:57:14,919 --> 02:57:22,208
MATT: Occasionally has to right his face, and it's
getting caught in the beard a little bit.

2742
02:57:22,208 --> 02:57:27,129
SAM: You know, family is everything, and I'm so
pleased to meet you. Can you tell me what she was

2743
02:57:27,129 --> 02:57:28,756
like as a child?

2744
02:57:28,756 --> 02:57:33,789
MATT: "Well, (chuckles) she--" At that point, the
door bursts open and the rest of you arrive there

2745
02:57:33,789 --> 02:57:35,692
at the Slayer's Cake.

2746
02:57:35,692 --> 02:57:37,097
TRAVIS: Yes!

2747
02:57:37,097 --> 02:57:39,869
ASHLEY: Oh, I see you got some blondies.

2748
02:57:39,869 --> 02:57:41,681
MATT: "We did. Your friend here--"

2749
02:57:41,681 --> 02:57:43,507
SAM: Taryon Darrington.

2750
02:57:43,507 --> 02:57:50,572
MATT: "Taryon Darrington, who apparently speaks
Gnomish-- look at you, keeping your culture. Was

2751
02:57:50,572 --> 02:57:53,054
"nice enough to give us the run of the house!"

2752
02:57:53,054 --> 02:57:56,470
SAM: I told them they could have anything they
wanted in the place, free of charge.

2753
02:57:56,470 --> 02:58:02,380
ASHLEY: I mean, just don't get sick by having too
many pastries.

2754
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:05,769
MATT: (chuckles) "Oh, my dear. That's not
possible."

2755
02:58:05,769 --> 02:58:18,322
ASHLEY: This is-- guys? Everybody? This is my
family. This is part of my family.

2756
02:58:18,322 --> 02:58:24,415
MATT: "Johann Trickfoot, random tasker, at your
service." He bows.

2757
02:58:24,415 --> 02:58:32,524
The woman with the curls says, "Astra Trickfoot.
This here's my lumpy husband." Elbows him in the

2758
02:58:32,524 --> 02:58:39,545
side. "And also at your service." And glances over
and does a quick scan of everybody and falls on

2759
02:58:39,609 --> 02:58:43,000
you and gives you a wink.

2760
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:54,339
JB, who is currently feeding the older uncle Ogden
Trickfoot, goes, "I'm JB. I'm the cousin who grew

2761
02:58:54,339 --> 02:58:59,949
"up with her the most. She's my favorite." At which
point, she's been so concentrated on this, she

2762
02:58:59,949 --> 02:59:08,468
doesn't realize she's been mashing the food into
the side of Ogden's cheek. (babbling) "I'm sorry."

2763
02:59:08,468 --> 02:59:10,387
She wipes him down.

2764
02:59:10,387 --> 02:59:16,361
LIAM: I'm sorry. What brings you fine folk into
town? Are you just visiting Pike here?

2765
02:59:16,361 --> 02:59:24,984
MATT: Astra goes, "Well, we travel a lot and we've
heard of exploits in various towns all around. I

2766
02:59:24,984 --> 02:59:29,336
"just have not had the chance to meet Pike after
all the stories I've heard, and Johann speaks of

2767
02:59:29,336 --> 02:59:34,105
"her often, and JB is pretty much obsessed with
your exploits."

2768
02:59:34,105 --> 02:59:37,436
JB's over there. "I've been keeping tabs."

2769
02:59:37,436 --> 02:59:48,225
"So we were surprised that we were located by a
courier who gave us your letter and your

2770
02:59:48,225 --> 02:59:55,731
"absolutely unnecessary but very appreciated
donation to the family, and we thought it would be

2771
02:59:55,731 --> 03:00:00,766
"nice and right of us to come and thank you in
person."

2772
03:00:00,766 --> 03:00:07,525
ASHLEY: Well, I'm so glad you did. How in the
world did you find out that I was here?

2773
03:00:07,525 --> 03:00:15,182
MATT: Johann and Astra turn their heads to JB, and
JB goes, "Well, I'm keeping tabs on what you've

2774
03:00:15,182 --> 03:00:19,081
"been doing. There had been word that you not only
helped with the reconstruction of Emon, but you've

2775
03:00:19,081 --> 03:00:26,192
"also been traveling to and from Whitestone since
the Conclave attacked the continent, so we

2776
03:00:26,192 --> 03:00:34,428
"narrowed it down between a few possibilities, and
based on the fact that you, Percival-- this is

2777
03:00:34,428 --> 03:00:40,278
"your city, is that correct? We figured that given
that basis, we had a good chance. We passed

2778
03:00:40,278 --> 03:00:46,558
"through Westruun and could not find you. Wilhand,
however, did say that you're doing well, and we

2779
03:00:46,558 --> 03:00:51,123
"eventually made our way east, and here we are.
It's good to see you."

2780
03:00:51,123 --> 03:00:53,386
ASHLEY: It's good to see you.

2781
03:00:53,606 --> 03:00:56,355
TRAVIS: Do me next. What have I done?

2782
03:00:56,355 --> 03:01:06,283
MATT: "You're Grog Strongjaw. Yes. You're the one
that apparently replaced me."

2783
03:01:06,283 --> 03:01:08,112
ASHLEY: Well--

2784
03:01:08,112 --> 03:01:09,857
TRAVIS: Huh?

2785
03:01:09,857 --> 03:01:19,175
MATT: "You grew up together once we were not, and
you're a strong half-giant of a man. The beard

2786
03:01:19,175 --> 03:01:29,686
"confuses me, but you've done many great things, I
suppose. The rest of you, it is an honor to meet

2787
03:01:29,686 --> 03:01:36,271
"you. I've heard so much, and it's rare you get to
meet heroes in your lifetime."

2788
03:01:36,271 --> 03:01:39,086
(shouting) "What? I'm still hungry!"

2789
03:01:39,086 --> 03:01:41,832
TRAVIS: They're so nice. I feel terrible.

2790
03:01:41,832 --> 03:01:47,568
ASHLEY: Are you guys just passing through? Where's
your next destination?

2791
03:01:47,568 --> 03:01:51,846
MATT: Johann pops up and goes, "We're always
passing through, my dear, but we figured we'd just

2792
03:01:51,846 --> 03:01:56,313
"stay for a few days. However long it takes to get
to know you a little better, and then we'll be on

2793
03:01:56,313 --> 03:01:57,577
"our way."

2794
03:01:57,577 --> 03:01:59,730
MARISHA: Did he say weeks? Did he slip that in?

2795
03:01:59,730 --> 03:02:01,580
MATT: "We could stay weeks, if you'd like!"

2796
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:03,591
LAURA: Well, you know, days might be more--

2797
03:02:03,591 --> 03:02:05,298
TRAVIS: As long as you need.

2798
03:02:05,298 --> 03:02:07,556
MATT: "We've been traveling. We're very tired."

2799
03:02:07,556 --> 03:02:11,156
TRAVIS: Pike's family is our family, really.

2800
03:02:11,156 --> 03:02:12,156
SAM: Agreed.

2801
03:02:12,156 --> 03:02:17,848
LIAM: I just want to get a vibe on them. I want to
do an insight check and see what I think of them.

2802
03:02:17,848 --> 03:02:19,599
MARISHA: Can I assist him on that?

2803
03:02:19,599 --> 03:02:23,281
MATT: Insight you can't-- you have to make an
individual insight check.

2804
03:02:23,281 --> 03:02:24,448
MARISHA: Individuals?

2805
03:02:24,448 --> 03:02:27,054
LIAM: Oh, jeebus. Crap. 13.

2806
03:02:27,054 --> 03:02:31,001
MARISHA: 26.

2807
03:02:31,001 --> 03:02:37,637
MATT: Okay. They're hard to read, in general.
They're strange. They're interesting. They're

2808
03:02:37,637 --> 03:02:47,195
unique. But they seem to be jovial and full of
personality. You get a very familiar vibe as you

2809
03:02:47,195 --> 03:02:49,480
did with Dr. Dranzel's troupe.

2810
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:54,435
TRAVIS: Could I request one thing? Could I have a
hug?

2811
03:02:54,435 --> 03:02:56,945
MATT: From?

2812
03:02:56,945 --> 03:02:59,952
TRAVIS: Yeah, all of you at once!

2813
03:02:59,952 --> 03:03:01,681
SAM: A bunch of kittens on a man.

2814
03:03:01,681 --> 03:03:07,715
MATT: They look at each other. Johann, and then
Astra rushes in. They both give you a hug, and

2815
03:03:07,715 --> 03:03:16,250
then Astra goes, "Uncle Ogden!" She grabs Ogden
and (yelps) comes over and, "I'm confused." He's

2816
03:03:16,250 --> 03:03:22,131
being held against you, really, and you watch as
JB approaches and pats you.

2817
03:03:22,131 --> 03:03:23,842
TRAVIS: It's okay.

2818
03:03:23,842 --> 03:03:29,247
ASHLEY: JB? Can I talk to you for just a minute?

2819
03:03:29,247 --> 03:03:30,614
MATT: "Of course."

2820
03:03:30,614 --> 03:03:35,208
ASHLEY: Just step outside on the outdoor bench.

2821
03:03:35,208 --> 03:03:38,923
MATT: She follows you out there. "You look so
pretty."

2822
03:03:38,923 --> 03:03:40,123
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you.

2823
03:03:40,123 --> 03:03:43,303
MATT: "You've done so many good things. I've heard
so many good things. It's so good to see you."

2824
03:03:43,303 --> 03:03:47,555
ASHLEY: It's very good to see you. How have you
been?

2825
03:03:47,555 --> 03:03:59,042
MATT: "Well, I've been watching Ogden. Traveling
and seeing the sights of the countrysides of

2826
03:03:59,042 --> 03:04:04,077
"Tal'Dorei. It's life on the road."

2827
03:04:04,077 --> 03:04:11,259
ASHLEY: I know. I understand that. How are my
parents?

2828
03:04:11,315 --> 03:04:17,357
MATT: She looks around and goes, "Well, we haven't
heard from your immediate side of the family since

2829
03:04:17,357 --> 03:04:21,951
"your bastard father left for Wynandia across the
sea. Good riddance. No offense."

2830
03:04:21,951 --> 03:04:23,473
ASHLEY: No. None taken.

2831
03:04:23,473 --> 03:04:27,948
MATT: "That was a long time ago. I was young. But
no, seriously.

2832
03:04:27,948 --> 03:04:30,281
"You're not missing much with them."

2833
03:04:30,281 --> 03:04:34,150
ASHLEY: Can I insight check her?

2834
03:04:34,150 --> 03:04:38,105
MATT: Go for it.

2835
03:04:38,105 --> 03:04:42,317
ASHLEY: Oh no. 13?

2836
03:04:42,317 --> 03:04:50,132
MATT: 13? She seems guarded and hard to read, but
legit.

2837
03:04:50,132 --> 03:05:02,893
ASHLEY: Okay. Well. Have you guys, in your
travels--

2838
03:05:02,893 --> 03:05:07,300
you know who Scanlan Shorthalt is, I'm sure?

2839
03:05:07,300 --> 03:05:12,788
MATT: She lights up and goes, "Yes, I've heard of
him. Is he around?"

2840
03:05:12,788 --> 03:05:15,137
ASHLEY: He's not around.

2841
03:05:15,137 --> 03:05:23,260
MATT: "Oh. Okay, but I've heard of him. I've heard
of his exploits. (chuckles) As I've asked around,

2842
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:26,853
"he's left quite a trail of ladies through the
years."

2843
03:05:26,853 --> 03:05:29,444
ASHLEY: He definitely has.

2844
03:05:29,444 --> 03:05:31,656
MATT: "They have a lot to say about him."

2845
03:05:31,656 --> 03:05:32,892
ASHLEY: Yes.

2846
03:05:32,892 --> 03:05:34,902
MATT: "Bit of a scoundrel, that one."

2847
03:05:34,902 --> 03:05:38,442
ASHLEY: Such a scoundrel.

2848
03:05:38,442 --> 03:05:40,540
LAURA: God, she's so weird.

2849
03:05:40,540 --> 03:05:43,271
(laughter)

2850
03:05:43,271 --> 03:05:45,474
LAURA: It makes me so uncomfortable.

2851
03:05:45,474 --> 03:05:50,234
ASHLEY: All right, well, let's go back inside.

2852
03:05:50,234 --> 03:05:53,039
MATT: "Of course. I'm glad we had this bonding
time."

2853
03:05:53,039 --> 03:05:55,133
ASHLEY: Me, too.

2854
03:05:55,133 --> 03:06:01,717
MATT: "You want to come, right?" She grabs your
arms and tugs a little bit. You get a very faint

2855
03:06:01,717 --> 03:06:04,688
sense of mild arrested development that makes you
a little uncomfortable.

2856
03:06:04,688 --> 03:06:06,307
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2857
03:06:06,307 --> 03:06:11,863
MATT: She walks inside with you with her arm on
your shoulder, and as you come back inside, the

2858
03:06:11,863 --> 03:06:17,483
hug seems to have pulled away from Grog for a
second, but the laughter is billowing from the

2859
03:06:17,483 --> 03:06:24,689
room, and Johann, at this point, is mid-story to
Grog. "And that's the craziest thing! She was so

2860
03:06:24,689 --> 03:06:27,108
"small, but could yet poop so much."

2861
03:06:27,328 --> 03:06:28,307
TRAVIS: I love it!

2862
03:06:28,307 --> 03:06:29,819
MATT: "It's incredible!"

2863
03:06:29,819 --> 03:06:33,076
TRAVIS: That's my favorite kind of people. Big
pooper!

2864
03:06:33,076 --> 03:06:39,059
MATT: "If we could have painted a picture, you
wouldn't know where she put it away! But that's

2865
03:06:39,059 --> 03:06:40,589
"another story."

2866
03:06:40,589 --> 03:06:48,801
ASHLEY: Oh, well, we don't need to keep saying
these things. You know, if you guys would like to

2867
03:06:48,801 --> 03:06:51,351
stay just for a few days, because we're going to
be leaving.

2868
03:06:51,351 --> 03:06:53,569
TRAVIS: No, we're not. We're here for a long
time.

2869
03:06:53,569 --> 03:06:55,821
ASHLEY: We have a lot of stuff to do.

2870
03:06:55,821 --> 03:06:57,631
LAURA: Trip coming up.

2871
03:06:57,631 --> 03:07:01,926
MATT: "Of course! Days. Weeks was invited here, of
course, but--"

2872
03:07:01,926 --> 03:07:03,469
LAURA: She doesn't actually live here.

2873
03:07:03,469 --> 03:07:09,148
MARISHA: I'm a guest, foreigner, just like you.
Passing through. Traveling on.

2874
03:07:09,221 --> 03:07:20,810
ASHLEY: I think we have a thing that we have to go
fight, and we have so many

2875
03:07:20,810 --> 03:07:22,263
things that we have to do.

2876
03:07:22,263 --> 03:07:25,334
TRAVIS: We just got done fighting all the things.
We're settling here.

2877
03:07:25,334 --> 03:07:26,600
LAURA: (groans)

2878
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:31,612
ASHLEY: We have some things planned.

2879
03:07:31,685 --> 03:07:35,888
MATT: Astra steps forward and takes your hand and
she goes, "It's all right, dear. We're not going

2880
03:07:35,888 --> 03:07:39,107
"to stay longer to make it uncomfortable. I'm sorry
about these folks."

2881
03:07:39,107 --> 03:07:40,600
ASHLEY: No, no.

2882
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:45,162
MATT: "I married into the Trickfoots. I'm not
bound to the same ridiculousness as these guys, so

2883
03:07:45,162 --> 03:07:46,581
"don't worry."

2884
03:07:46,581 --> 03:07:47,904
ASHLEY: Okay.

2885
03:07:47,904 --> 03:07:50,785
MARISHA: Can I insight check that?

2886
03:07:50,785 --> 03:07:52,305
MATT: Sure.

2887
03:07:52,305 --> 03:07:57,715
MARISHA: I don't trust your "married in this
bullshit" shit. 20, total.

2888
03:07:57,715 --> 03:07:59,465
MATT: 20 total?

2889
03:07:59,465 --> 03:08:00,658
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2890
03:08:00,658 --> 03:08:03,604
LAURA: I bet she's at the helm!

2891
03:08:03,604 --> 03:08:05,205
TALIESIN: Happy new year, everybody.

2892
03:08:05,205 --> 03:08:08,441
LAURA: I don't like her winking at Percy!

2893
03:08:08,441 --> 03:08:11,308
TALIESIN: While we're whispering about things--

2894
03:08:11,308 --> 03:08:16,030
SAM: We have a great new shirt in the store. It
says Vox Machina.

2895
03:08:16,030 --> 03:08:20,931
LAURA: (silly accent) If you could get a close-up,
you would see all of the Vox Machina's made of a

2896
03:08:20,931 --> 03:08:23,196
different weapon that Vox Machina uses.

2897
03:08:23,196 --> 03:08:25,705
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

2898
03:08:25,705 --> 03:08:39,223
ASHLEY: Well, why don't you guys stay in my place,
and I'll take care of you guys while you're here?

2899
03:08:39,291 --> 03:08:49,731
Just explore the town, and when we're getting
ready to go, I'll let you know, and you guys can

2900
03:08:49,731 --> 03:08:51,881
go on your merry way.

2901
03:08:51,881 --> 03:08:55,782
MATT: "That sounds fantastic."

2902
03:08:55,782 --> 03:08:57,049
ASHLEY: Okay.

2903
03:08:57,049 --> 03:08:59,284
MATT: "It's so happy to have the Trickfoots
together again."

2904
03:08:59,284 --> 03:09:01,474
ASHLEY: It's just so great.

2905
03:09:01,474 --> 03:09:03,751
MATT: "So where are we all staying?"

2906
03:09:03,751 --> 03:09:05,938
ASHLEY: Well, you can stay at my place.

2907
03:09:05,938 --> 03:09:10,935
MATT: "Fantastic! Wondrous. Show us along! We have
things to unload."

2908
03:09:10,935 --> 03:09:12,303
ASHLEY: Okay.

2909
03:09:12,303 --> 03:09:15,642
LAURA: Do you want to grab any of the last bit of
pastries for the day?

2910
03:09:15,642 --> 03:09:18,697
Obviously, free treats today.

2911
03:09:18,697 --> 03:09:23,928
SAM: Oh, but don't fill up, because I assume we're
all going to have dinner tonight together, right?

2912
03:09:23,928 --> 03:09:26,688
ALL: Yeah.

2913
03:09:26,688 --> 03:09:28,699
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's have dinner.

2914
03:09:28,699 --> 03:09:32,263
MATT: "Wonderful. I love it. I love it!"

2915
03:09:32,263 --> 03:09:38,052
LAURA: Free treats today! Just today. Just today,
free treats for the family.

2916
03:09:38,052 --> 03:09:39,920
After that, no free treats.

2917
03:09:39,920 --> 03:09:49,046
MATT: As you're saying this, Uncle Ogden has
stepped forward again and JB is like,

2918
03:09:49,046 --> 03:10:05,750
"Uncle Ogden?" He (grunts) and reaches out and finds the
edge of your cheek and chin and he drops his cane,

2919
03:10:05,750 --> 03:10:11,101
pulls his glasses off, and you see these tiny,
dark beady eyes between the wrinkles and he goes,

2920
03:10:11,101 --> 03:10:13,821
"Pike."

2921
03:10:13,821 --> 03:10:15,270
ASHLEY: Hi.

2922
03:10:15,270 --> 03:10:18,065
MATT: "It's so good to see you."

2923
03:10:18,065 --> 03:10:21,363
ASHLEY: It's so good to see you.

2924
03:10:21,363 --> 03:10:32,540
MATT: "Thank you. You're a good one." He puts his
glasses back on and reaches out, and JB picks up a

2925
03:10:32,540 --> 03:10:36,186
stick and hands it to him. He's like, "Thank
you."

2926
03:10:36,186 --> 03:10:38,858
ASHLEY: Thank you, Uncle Ogden.

2927
03:10:38,858 --> 03:10:41,350
LAURA: Does it look like he really needs that
cane?

2928
03:10:41,350 --> 03:10:43,478
MATT: You want to make an insight check?

2929
03:10:43,478 --> 03:10:45,585
(laughter)

2930
03:10:45,585 --> 03:10:47,219
MATT: Sure, go for it.

2931
03:10:47,219 --> 03:10:51,960
TRAVIS: Kick the cane out, see what happens.
Do you need this? Boom!

2932
03:10:52,035 --> 03:10:54,132
LAURA: I think it looks like he really needs it.

2933
03:10:54,132 --> 03:10:56,339
MATT: You genuinely feel bad for even having that
second thought.

2934
03:10:56,339 --> 03:10:58,538
(laughter)

2935
03:10:58,538 --> 03:11:00,604
LAURA: I do. I feel really terrible.

2936
03:11:00,604 --> 03:11:09,321
SAM: In my broken Gnome, I tell him: it's an honor
to mate you.

2937
03:11:09,321 --> 03:11:13,145
(laughter)

2938
03:11:13,145 --> 03:11:19,660
MATT: His head spins for a second. He smiles, and
in Gnomish back to you, he says,

2939
03:11:19,660 --> 03:11:23,445
"Oh. It's been a while."

2940
03:11:23,445 --> 03:11:27,302
SAM: I love him.

2941
03:11:27,302 --> 03:11:33,175
ASHLEY: Well, should we get some dinner? Are you
guys hungry, or have you filled up on pastries?

2942
03:11:33,175 --> 03:11:39,404
MATT: "Oh!" You watch as Johann spits out the
pastry. "Always hungry!"

2943
03:11:39,404 --> 03:11:46,389
ASHLEY: Okay, great. Well, let's have a delicious
dinner.

2944
03:11:46,389 --> 03:11:51,060
MARISHA: We could always go hunting for our
dinner. Classic way.

2945
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:55,268
LAURA: That's how we do it in Whitestone. You have
to hunt if you want to eat.

2946
03:11:55,268 --> 03:11:57,520
That's how we do it here.

2947
03:11:57,520 --> 03:11:59,181
MATT: "Is that how you got your pastries?"

2948
03:11:59,181 --> 03:12:04,569
LAURA: Well, hunting for any kind of meat.
Pastries you pay for.

2949
03:12:04,569 --> 03:12:07,334
ASHLEY: For the meat pies.

2950
03:12:07,334 --> 03:12:15,820
MATT: "Well, we're not hunters, so I guess we'll
stay here until you finish hunting. You know we're

2951
03:12:15,820 --> 03:12:19,659
"not hunters. We've never been hunters. Trickfoots
don't hunt."

2952
03:12:19,659 --> 03:12:23,413
ASHLEY: We can-- (sighs).

2953
03:12:23,482 --> 03:12:26,698
SAM: Let's go freshen up for dinner.

2954
03:12:26,698 --> 03:12:28,378
ASHLEY: We'll go freshen up for dinner.

2955
03:12:28,378 --> 03:12:31,746
MATT: "Not a bad idea. I could use a bath,
actually. How about you, Astra?"

2956
03:12:31,746 --> 03:12:34,067
Astra's like, "Oh, I'd love a bath right now. I've
been on the road for so long."

2957
03:12:34,067 --> 03:12:37,266
And JB goes, "Uncle could really use a bath."

2958
03:12:37,266 --> 03:12:39,859
ASHLEY: Uncle could use a bath, I know.

2959
03:12:39,859 --> 03:12:41,504
TRAVIS: He could. He smells like cheese.

2960
03:12:41,504 --> 03:12:44,558
ASHLEY: All right. I'll walk you guys. Let's walk
to my place.

2961
03:12:44,558 --> 03:12:46,659
MATT: "Very well. Show us along!"

2962
03:12:46,659 --> 03:12:51,489
LAURA: I want to whisper to you as we walk back to
the house: don't give them any more free things,

2963
03:12:51,563 --> 03:12:52,545
all right?

2964
03:12:52,545 --> 03:12:54,145
SAM: What? I thought they were Pike's people.

2965
03:12:54,145 --> 03:12:58,819
LAURA: Yeah, they're great. They're wonderful, but
no more free stuff. Just today,

2966
03:12:58,819 --> 03:13:00,437
but no more after that.

2967
03:13:00,437 --> 03:13:03,776
SAM: Okay. Of course. I'm sorry if I was out of
line.

2968
03:13:03,776 --> 03:13:05,407
LAURA: Of course not. You're so generous.

2969
03:13:05,407 --> 03:13:07,617
SAM: I love you.

2970
03:13:07,617 --> 03:13:09,139
LAURA: I love you so much.

2971
03:13:09,139 --> 03:13:12,509
LIAM: I'm hooking Kiki by the arm. Hey, you've got
that look in your eye.

2972
03:13:12,509 --> 03:13:19,223
MARISHA: I just don't like it when people try to
take advantage of my friends, but they're family,

2973
03:13:19,223 --> 03:13:24,384
and if anyone is in need, I don't want to
potentially put them out.

2974
03:13:24,384 --> 03:13:31,061
LIAM: But you think they're a little bit hinky?
That's a yes.

2975
03:13:31,061 --> 03:13:36,067
MARISHA: We can just keep an eye out. I'm
protective.

2976
03:13:36,067 --> 03:13:43,804
TALIESIN: Pike, if you need anything, just let me
know. And I completely understand the awkward

2977
03:13:43,804 --> 03:13:46,057
position you're currently being put in.

2978
03:13:46,057 --> 03:13:52,219
ASHLEY: Oh god, it's so awkward! I just don't
know. Thank you, Percy. I'll let you know if

2979
03:13:52,219 --> 03:13:54,179
there's anything that I need.

2980
03:13:54,179 --> 03:13:56,601
TALIESIN: Keep an eye on the odd one.

2981
03:13:56,601 --> 03:14:00,818
ASHLEY: Which one? Because they're all odd.

2982
03:14:00,818 --> 03:14:06,558
TALIESIN: JB. She reminds me of me at that age.
That's not a good thing.

2983
03:14:06,558 --> 03:14:13,819
MARISHA: I say to Vax: Just keep an eye on the odd
one, all right?

2984
03:14:13,819 --> 03:14:16,603
TALIESIN: See if you notice an interest.

2985
03:14:16,603 --> 03:14:19,344
TRAVIS: Pike, are there any more coming?

2986
03:14:19,344 --> 03:14:25,107
TALIESIN: If you notice an interest in that one,
please let me know. Maybe I could figure out what

2987
03:14:25,107 --> 03:14:27,119
she's interested in and show her around, maybe.

2988
03:14:27,119 --> 03:14:35,656
ASHLEY: Okay. That's a great idea. So this is all
of you, then, that came? You guys have been

2989
03:14:35,656 --> 03:14:37,612
traveling around, just yourselves?

2990
03:14:37,612 --> 03:14:39,325
TRAVIS: Got any more of you coming?

2991
03:14:39,325 --> 03:14:45,445
MATT: "Not coming with us. The Trickfoots tend to
scatter on their own."

2992
03:14:45,445 --> 03:14:46,557
TRAVIS: Like bunnies.

2993
03:14:46,557 --> 03:14:54,348
MATT: "Yeah, sure. We'll go with that one. Yeah,
not everyone can be trusted in the family."

2994
03:14:54,348 --> 03:14:56,620
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2995
03:14:56,620 --> 03:15:03,335
MATT: "It's frustrating. The people that you care
for and spend your life hitting behind betray that

2996
03:15:03,335 --> 03:15:05,984
"trust, and good riddance to them."

2997
03:15:05,984 --> 03:15:10,088
ASHLEY: Oh. Well, is there anything you would like
to see while you're here?

2998
03:15:10,088 --> 03:15:15,672
MATT: They all look back at JB, who lights up
again and goes, "Everything."

2999
03:15:15,753 --> 03:15:27,740
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, is there anyone in particular
you would like to give you a tour?

3000
03:15:27,740 --> 03:15:37,074
MATT: JB is like, "Well, I--"

3001
03:15:37,074 --> 03:15:42,119
And Johann goes, "I feel like if we don't choose 
him, we're going to get squashed."

3002
03:15:42,119 --> 03:15:44,110
(laughter)

3003
03:15:44,185 --> 03:15:49,589
MATT: You can see a moment of heartbreak and JB
goes, "Very well."

3004
03:15:49,589 --> 03:15:50,748
TRAVIS: Yes!

3005
03:15:50,748 --> 03:15:53,264
MATT: "Mr. Strongjaw, you may show us around."

3006
03:15:53,264 --> 03:15:55,560
TRAVIS: Yeah. You won't regret that choice.

3007
03:15:55,560 --> 03:16:07,000
ASHLEY: All right, come with me. You can come to
my place, freshen up before dinner, and we'll have

3008
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:08,515
a great time.

3009
03:16:08,515 --> 03:16:14,493
MATT: "Great! Great. Now, to the baths. How big
are your baths? Are they huge? Are they

3010
03:16:14,493 --> 03:16:16,612
"human-sized baths? Are they bigger than
human-sized baths?"

3011
03:16:16,612 --> 03:16:18,635
LIAM: Not quite big enough.

3012
03:16:18,635 --> 03:16:22,131
(laughter)

3013
03:16:22,213 --> 03:16:23,568
LAURA: You don't know.

3014
03:16:23,568 --> 03:16:34,689
MATT: "You!" All right, so you show them up to the
castle, which I assume is where you're letting

3015
03:16:34,689 --> 03:16:36,063
them stay.

3016
03:16:36,063 --> 03:16:37,311
LAURA: They're staying in the castle?

3017
03:16:37,311 --> 03:16:44,954
TALIESIN: The guards have generally been alerted
to be wary, kind, polite, and less important that

3018
03:16:44,954 --> 03:16:49,854
they stop them from doing anything too terrible,
more to the point that they just write it down and

3019
03:16:49,854 --> 03:16:51,126
report it immediately.

3020
03:16:51,126 --> 03:16:53,357
(laughter)

3021
03:16:53,357 --> 03:16:57,698
TALIESIN: Unless anyone's doing something
terrible, or going somewhere they really

3022
03:16:57,698 --> 03:16:59,071
shouldn't.

3023
03:16:59,071 --> 03:17:04,310
MATT: Right. Okay. That information is easily
distributed throughout the Pale Guard,

3024
03:17:04,310 --> 03:17:06,414
without issue.

3025
03:17:06,414 --> 03:17:09,125
LIAM: "I guess that silverware wasn't so
important."

3026
03:17:09,125 --> 03:17:11,653
TALIESIN: Oh, we're bringing out the moderate
silverware.

3027
03:17:11,653 --> 03:17:14,202
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. That's a great idea.

3028
03:17:14,274 --> 03:17:19,646
LAURA: All the good silver is hidden. Hidden up
high.

3029
03:17:19,646 --> 03:17:26,180
MATT: Because there are only within the castle at
any given time, four baths. Four rooms that

3030
03:17:26,180 --> 03:17:33,567
contain full baths. Occasionally, you have to wait
for a person, but they immediately scatter. Three

3031
03:17:33,567 --> 03:17:35,224
of them are taken.

3032
03:17:35,224 --> 03:17:38,805
ASHLEY: Okay. We might have to wait a little bit.

3033
03:17:38,805 --> 03:17:45,490
MATT: You wait a while. Eventually, they one by
one start making their way down to the main

3034
03:17:45,490 --> 03:17:55,326
banquet hall of the castle. Cleaned up. You watch
as Johann comes down, wearing his same clothing

3035
03:17:55,326 --> 03:18:00,215
that appears to have been cleaned. "Wow! I'm
appreciative that you have servants here that can

3036
03:18:00,215 --> 03:18:06,378
"do such a nice job with such fine family threads."
His mustache is done perfectly. His hair is still

3037
03:18:06,378 --> 03:18:11,791
slick and wet from the bath, combed over. "Well,
thank you. It's in the blood."

3038
03:18:11,791 --> 03:18:13,714
ASHLEY: (chuckles) It sure is.

3039
03:18:13,714 --> 03:18:20,024
MATT: He turns around. "Astra? What's taking her
so long?" Walks back out to the stairway and

3040
03:18:20,024 --> 03:18:24,514
rushes past the guards, his little gnomish head
dodging by their knees, almost. He goes,

3041
03:18:24,514 --> 03:18:26,194
(shouting) "Astra!"

3042
03:18:26,194 --> 03:18:30,000
You hear a voice go, (shouting) "I'm almost done!
Wait and be patient!"

3043
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:35,009
He goes back. "She'll be down in a moment. Don't
worry. In the meantime,

3044
03:18:35,009 --> 03:18:37,448
"is there an appetizer course?"

3045
03:18:37,448 --> 03:18:49,352
ASHLEY: Sure. Why don't you take a seat, and order
whatever you want, on me.

3046
03:18:49,352 --> 03:18:58,320
MATT: "You're so generous!" He pinches your cheek.
He waltzes over to the table, sits down and grabs

3047
03:18:58,320 --> 03:19:09,420
the fork and knife. "Two bottles of red, and...
ooh, what vintage have you?" He begins talking

3048
03:19:09,512 --> 03:19:12,271
with the servants about what various wines are
available.

3049
03:19:12,271 --> 03:19:15,136
LAURA: I'm just going to pop into the kitchen.

3050
03:19:15,136 --> 03:19:16,706
MATT: Okay.

3051
03:19:16,706 --> 03:19:25,327
LAURA: And tell the staff in the kitchen:
obviously, you can make whatever you want. I'm

3052
03:19:25,327 --> 03:19:31,624
just hoping maybe you don't make it too tasty
tonight. Nothing too extravagant. You know, nice,

3053
03:19:31,624 --> 03:19:33,564
but average. Right?

3054
03:19:33,564 --> 03:19:38,811
MATT: The servants that are there, the whole
waitstaff and kitchen staff go,

3055
03:19:38,811 --> 03:19:40,505
"Of course, milady."

3056
03:19:40,505 --> 03:19:42,467
LAURA: Nothing great.

3057
03:19:42,467 --> 03:19:46,573
MATT: "A curious request, but one we will fulfill
to our greatest ability."

3058
03:19:46,573 --> 03:19:58,972
LAURA: Thank you so much. Lots of salad, lots of
very dry, hard meat. Turnips. Lots of turnips.

3059
03:19:58,972 --> 03:20:00,209
TALIESIN: Heavy food.

3060
03:20:00,209 --> 03:20:01,486
LAURA: Yeah.

3061
03:20:01,486 --> 03:20:03,123
SAM: I'm going to pop into the kitchen after she's
done.

3062
03:20:03,123 --> 03:20:05,946
(laughter)

3063
03:20:05,946 --> 03:20:11,195
SAM: All right, family's here tonight, so
everything has to be on its best, all right? The

3064
03:20:11,195 --> 03:20:15,479
best stuff we have in this kitchen. These are
Trickfoots. We have to treat them right, and we

3065
03:20:15,479 --> 03:20:16,756
have to treat them well.

3066
03:20:16,756 --> 03:20:22,886
MATT: The staff stops and goes, "Friend Taryon,
I'm sorry, but the lady requested specifically

3067
03:20:23,028 --> 03:20:24,518
"that the meal not be--"

3068
03:20:24,518 --> 03:20:25,704
SAM: What lady?

3069
03:20:25,704 --> 03:20:28,255
MATT: "Lady Vex'ahlia."

3070
03:20:28,255 --> 03:20:33,648
SAM: She was being polite. These are good people.
They need to be treated--

3071
03:20:33,648 --> 03:20:38,170
MATT: Make a persuasion check. You're asking them
to override the word of the lady of the house.

3072
03:20:38,170 --> 03:20:39,214
SAM One.

3073
03:20:39,214 --> 03:20:41,021
(laughter)

3074
03:20:41,021 --> 03:20:43,933
MATT: He goes, "I am sorry, but--"

3075
03:20:43,933 --> 03:20:45,500
SAM: Who's your manager?

3076
03:20:45,500 --> 03:20:49,054
MATT: "The lady you're speaking about."

3077
03:20:49,241 --> 03:20:52,334
SAM: Oh, you're right. She is your manager.

3078
03:20:52,334 --> 03:20:55,800
LIAM: Tary, you have Luck!

3079
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:58,348
TALIESIN: Back to the pool house with you.

3080
03:20:58,348 --> 03:20:59,737
SAM: I do have Luck.

3081
03:20:59,737 --> 03:21:03,634
LAURA: (groans) No!

3082
03:21:03,634 --> 03:21:05,050
SAM: What am I doing?

3083
03:21:05,050 --> 03:21:06,413
MATT: Persuasion.

3084
03:21:06,413 --> 03:21:08,094
LAURA: No.

3085
03:21:08,094 --> 03:21:09,440
SAM: That's 24.

3086
03:21:09,440 --> 03:21:11,113
TALIESIN: Oh!

3087
03:21:11,113 --> 03:21:16,000
MATT: He goes, "But if you say it's the word of
Lady Vex'ahlia--"

3088
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:22,281
SAM: These are Trickfoots, man. Trickfoots! Treat
them as you would your own mother.

3089
03:21:22,281 --> 03:21:33,461
MATT: "I'm so confused. We'll do our best. Holy shit."
You see this internal struggle. "Everyone! Fine

3090
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:39,291
"meat's back on the menu. Sorry." And the staff
goes, (groans) and starts throwing shit out that

3091
03:21:39,291 --> 03:21:42,022
they were halfway working on and starting from
scratch.

3092
03:21:42,022 --> 03:21:49,767
SAM: I go out and grab Vex. Little EG, what are
you doing? You told them to give them bad food

3093
03:21:49,767 --> 03:21:53,385
tonight? These are Trickfoots! We have to treat
them with honor and respect.

3094
03:21:53,385 --> 03:21:55,688
LAURA: Tary! Ugh.

3095
03:21:55,688 --> 03:21:56,935
TALIESIN: You said what?

3096
03:21:56,935 --> 03:22:05,734
LAURA: Okay, look. All right. If your father came,
and you dislike him very much, right?

3097
03:22:05,734 --> 03:22:07,521
SAM: I would give him the best.

3098
03:22:07,521 --> 03:22:12,323
LAURA: Oh shit. Okay, bad comparison. These people
suck. They're mean--

3099
03:22:12,323 --> 03:22:15,457
SAM: What are you talking about? They've been
nothing but nice. They've showered her with kisses

3100
03:22:15,457 --> 03:22:19,199
and affection. It's affection that I've never even
seen in a family before!

3101
03:22:19,199 --> 03:22:28,537
LAURA: Tary, dear. Darling. They don't treat her
very well, and they'll use her, and they'll stay

3102
03:22:28,537 --> 03:22:32,305
here and keep taking advantage of her, and we
don't want that.

3103
03:22:32,305 --> 03:22:34,599
SAM: But I get to practice my Gnome.

3104
03:22:34,599 --> 03:22:39,554
LAURA: Well, that's true. You can practice as much
as you want over the next couple of days, but we

3105
03:22:39,554 --> 03:22:43,561
don't want to impress them. The more they like it,
the longer they'll stay.

3106
03:22:43,561 --> 03:22:48,441
TALIESIN: They'll figure out that the poor food--
I feel like they're clever enough for that one.

3107
03:22:48,441 --> 03:22:50,832
Best to feed them well, at least.

3108
03:22:50,832 --> 03:22:51,838
LAURA: Really?

3109
03:22:51,838 --> 03:22:52,941
TALIESIN: I know.

3110
03:22:52,941 --> 03:22:54,473
SAM: I'll back off.

3111
03:22:54,473 --> 03:22:56,559
LAURA: Thank you.

3112
03:22:56,559 --> 03:22:58,187
TALIESIN: Continue to be charming.

3113
03:22:58,187 --> 03:22:59,410
SAM: Always.

3114
03:22:59,410 --> 03:23:06,706
TRAVIS: I walk into the kitchen. I go, okay.
Listen up! I need peanut butter, I need turkey

3115
03:23:06,706 --> 03:23:09,018
legs, eggs, cheese.

3116
03:23:09,018 --> 03:23:12,496
(laughter)

3117
03:23:12,496 --> 03:23:14,868
SAM: "Those are all the foods I know."

3118
03:23:14,868 --> 03:23:20,284
TRAVIS: Chop chop!

3119
03:23:20,361 --> 03:23:29,681
MATT: The servants all stop and go, (sighs). "Yes,
Grand Poobah."

3120
03:23:29,681 --> 03:23:33,684
(laughter)

3121
03:23:33,684 --> 03:23:38,706
MATT: Throw out what they were finishing and begin
to make eggs, getting the cheese ready, and all

3122
03:23:38,706 --> 03:23:41,986
the hearty pork meats. And the peanut butter.

3123
03:23:41,986 --> 03:23:46,942
MARISHA: It's a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.

3124
03:23:46,942 --> 03:23:48,701
LAURA: Spaghetti-Os.

3125
03:23:48,701 --> 03:23:50,089
MARISHA: Popcorn.

3126
03:23:50,089 --> 03:23:58,203
ASHLEY: Just great. I run over to Percy really
quickly. (whispering) Percy?

3127
03:23:58,203 --> 03:23:59,857
TALIESIN: Yes?

3128
03:23:59,857 --> 03:24:06,777
ASHLEY: I just wanted to... apologize in advance
for whatever may happen in the next few days.

3129
03:24:06,852 --> 03:24:12,507
TALIESIN: I'm so excited for the calamity that's
about to be brought down upon my house.

3130
03:24:12,507 --> 03:24:13,871
ASHLEY: Okay.

3131
03:24:13,871 --> 03:24:23,642
TALIESIN: There is nothing, short of full dragon
apocalypse at this point, that could faze us. We

3132
03:24:23,642 --> 03:24:26,014
can live through this. We'll be fine.

3133
03:24:26,014 --> 03:24:27,359
ASHLEY: Okay.

3134
03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:29,188
LAURA: I come up and I give her a hug from behind
and say:

3135
03:24:29,188 --> 03:24:31,810
We will never judge you for your blood, dear.

3136
03:24:31,810 --> 03:24:34,689
ASHLEY: Okay. Again, I'm not embarrassed.

3137
03:24:34,689 --> 03:24:38,139
LAURA: Of course not. They're great. They seem
wonderful.

3138
03:24:38,139 --> 03:24:40,079
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, they do.

3139
03:24:40,079 --> 03:24:43,543
TALIESIN: To be fair, I've also already started
drinking.

3140
03:24:43,543 --> 03:24:45,964
ASHLEY: Oh great. Okay, I'll join you.

3141
03:24:45,964 --> 03:24:48,100
TALIESIN: I pull out the flask of Courage that
I've brought.

3142
03:24:48,100 --> 03:24:49,180
SAM: Flask of Courage?

3143
03:24:49,180 --> 03:24:51,431
LAURA: You got more Courage?

3144
03:24:51,431 --> 03:24:53,853
TALIESIN: Oh, there's a lot of Courage. We make it
every year.

3145
03:24:53,853 --> 03:24:58,115
ASHLEY: I take a big gulp. All the gulps.

3146
03:24:58,115 --> 03:25:00,272
MATT: It burns. It burns so good.

3147
03:25:00,272 --> 03:25:01,710
ASHLEY: (grunts)

3148
03:25:01,710 --> 03:25:04,602
TALIESIN: It burns a lot.

3149
03:25:04,602 --> 03:25:05,732
ASHLEY: It does.

3150
03:25:05,732 --> 03:25:08,704
TALIESIN: You're going to get drunk, but you're
not going to get sleepy.

3151
03:25:08,704 --> 03:25:12,188
LAURA: Oh, that's going to feel good in this
area.

3152
03:25:12,188 --> 03:25:13,867
TRAVIS: You won't get sleepy.

3153
03:25:13,867 --> 03:25:15,243
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

3154
03:25:15,243 --> 03:25:16,566
ASHLEY: Let's go eat.

3155
03:25:16,566 --> 03:25:24,313
MATT: As you guys all find yourselves ready, the
Trickfoots also begin to fill in to the banquet

3156
03:25:24,313 --> 03:25:33,297
hall. The servants provide a fantastic spread of
heartily cooked pork meats, peanut butter fresh

3157
03:25:33,362 --> 03:25:36,337
from the jar, piles of cheeses.

3158
03:25:36,337 --> 03:25:39,629
LAURA: I thought you asked--

3159
03:25:39,629 --> 03:25:43,745
SAM: This is not what I asked for.

3160
03:25:43,745 --> 03:25:50,710
ASHLEY: This is comfort food in Whitestone.

3161
03:25:50,710 --> 03:25:56,339
TALIESIN: We thought we would give you the
cornucopia of our experience.

3162
03:25:56,339 --> 03:26:00,950
LAURA: I take a big spoon of peanut butter.

3163
03:26:00,950 --> 03:26:06,279
MATT: Johann gives a curious eye and goes, "Well,
who are we to scoff at the cultures of others?

3164
03:26:06,279 --> 03:26:13,149
"Let's dig in, everyone!" And immediately he goes
in. Astra begins eating, as well. JB takes a bite

3165
03:26:13,149 --> 03:26:20,665
and then prepares a bite for Uncle Ogden, who is
in the process of staring at the table strangely.

3166
03:26:20,665 --> 03:26:26,085
Eventually the spoon finds its way there.

3167
03:26:26,085 --> 03:26:28,789
TALIESIN: Well, that's the next 30 minutes.

3168
03:26:28,789 --> 03:26:39,238
MATT: As this is happening, Johann begins asking
questions. "So! This is your castle?"

3169
03:26:39,238 --> 03:26:41,281
ASHLEY: Is this my castle?

3170
03:26:41,281 --> 03:26:50,584
MATT: JB is like, "No, it's not her castle. It's
his castle. She's just staying here, for now."

3171
03:26:50,584 --> 03:26:53,655
TALIESIN: Technically, it's my sister's castle,
but certainly.

3172
03:26:53,655 --> 03:27:03,392
MATT: At which point, Cassandra comes in from the
back, arms crossed. She wanders in. "Brother?"

3173
03:27:03,392 --> 03:27:08,272
TALIESIN: That's code. Yes?

3174
03:27:08,352 --> 03:27:12,555
MATT: "Everything all right, brother?"

3175
03:27:12,555 --> 03:27:13,867
TALIESIN: Yes, fine.

3176
03:27:13,867 --> 03:27:18,391
MATT: "Very well, I'll be in my chambers if you
require anything."

3177
03:27:18,391 --> 03:27:21,168
LAURA: You're sure you don't want to join us,
Cass?

3178
03:27:21,168 --> 03:27:31,779
MATT: "I'm fine. I'm a bit tired. It's been a long
night. But whoever you are, welcome to

3179
03:27:31,779 --> 03:27:35,285
"Whitestone." She looks back to Percival.

3180
03:27:35,285 --> 03:27:36,980
TALIESIN: The Trickfoot clan.

3181
03:27:36,980 --> 03:27:39,380
MATT: "Ah."

3182
03:27:39,380 --> 03:27:40,770
MARISHA: And Keyleth goes--

3183
03:27:40,770 --> 03:27:47,879
ASHLEY If she looks over at me, I'm going--

3184
03:27:47,879 --> 03:27:53,366
MATT: "I would love to welcome you all to
Whitestone. You are guests of ours if you are

3185
03:27:53,366 --> 03:27:56,548
"guests of hers. We'll talk later."

3186
03:27:56,548 --> 03:27:58,091
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

3187
03:27:58,091 --> 03:28:07,071
MATT: She makes her way back up the stairs. You
watch as Trish, who's her bodyguard on this shift,

3188
03:28:07,071 --> 03:28:08,354
follows her up.

3189
03:28:08,354 --> 03:28:10,545
LAURA: She's still here? Trish.

3190
03:28:10,545 --> 03:28:12,654
ASHLEY: Trish the Dish.

3191
03:28:12,654 --> 03:28:15,166
TRAVIS: Trish the Dish.

3192
03:28:15,166 --> 03:28:21,625
MATT: She's one of two shift personal guards of
Cassandra.

3193
03:28:21,625 --> 03:28:25,889
ASHLEY: I'm going to sit next to Ogden.

3194
03:28:25,889 --> 03:28:27,565
MATT: Okay.

3195
03:28:27,565 --> 03:28:34,381
ASHLEY: JB, I can feed him for a little bit if
you'd like to look around or something, or talk to

3196
03:28:34,381 --> 03:28:39,188
anybody here? Who do you really want to talk to?

3197
03:28:39,188 --> 03:28:46,288
MATT: "You. We have so much to catch up on. It's
been a long time."

3198
03:28:46,288 --> 03:28:54,310
ASHLEY: Is there someone in Vox Machina that you
really love?

3199
03:28:54,310 --> 03:29:07,416
MATT: She looks around. There's this long, awkward
pause as she keeps looking over Vox Machina again

3200
03:29:07,416 --> 03:29:17,154
and again, but not making any eye contact with
Grog, and eventually goes,

3201
03:29:17,154 --> 03:29:22,928
"I suppose Lady Vex'ahlia." Hands the spoon 
over to you.

3202
03:29:22,996 --> 03:29:36,362
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I'm sure she would love to
talk to you. She's very inviting, very friendly.

3203
03:29:36,362 --> 03:29:39,195
MATT: "Should I just go sit?"

3204
03:29:39,195 --> 03:29:40,370
ASHLEY: Sure.

3205
03:29:40,370 --> 03:29:47,677
MATT: "Okay." She gets up from the table. Johann's
still talking. He's telling stories. "We

3206
03:29:47,677 --> 03:29:53,721
"Trickfoots. For generations, we've been
problem-solvers. We rove from place to place,

3207
03:29:53,721 --> 03:29:59,367
"solving problems across the countrysides. If you
have a squeaky wheel, we fix the wheel. If you

3208
03:29:59,367 --> 03:30:00,938
"have a squeaky door, we fix the door."

3209
03:30:00,938 --> 03:30:02,128
TRAVIS: Amazing.

3210
03:30:02,128 --> 03:30:09,845
MATT: "If you have a squeaky tax man, we fix the
tax man. That's a joke! That's a joke. You can

3211
03:30:09,903 --> 03:30:11,467
"laugh. See, there you are."

3212
03:30:11,467 --> 03:30:13,726
TRAVIS: They kill the tax man.

3213
03:30:13,726 --> 03:30:15,257
SAM: Everybody hates taxes.

3214
03:30:15,257 --> 03:30:28,914
MATT: As this conversation's happening, there's a
small bowl of what looks to be some of the pork,

3215
03:30:28,914 --> 03:30:33,749
but it's been soaked in some water or wine, and
it's been mashed or pre-chewed. You're not quite

3216
03:30:33,749 --> 03:30:42,784
sure. But you have the spoon there, and you have
Uncle Ogden sitting there going--

3217
03:30:42,784 --> 03:30:51,990
ASHLEY: I start speaking to him in Underdark
because I haven't spoken that in a while. Ogden?

3218
03:30:51,990 --> 03:31:04,253
How are you liking traveling with everybody? With
Johann and Astra and JB?

3219
03:31:04,253 --> 03:31:14,405
MATT: His ear perks up a little bit and he goes,
"I haven't heard that talk in a long time." His

3220
03:31:14,405 --> 03:31:18,183
head turns slightly towards you, but he's still
looking off a little bit from under the glasses.

3221
03:31:18,183 --> 03:31:19,524
SAM: Is this Undercommon?

3222
03:31:19,524 --> 03:31:20,905
ASHLEY: Underdark.

3223
03:31:20,905 --> 03:31:21,966
SAM: Underdark?

3224
03:31:21,966 --> 03:31:23,546
MATT: It would be considered Undercommon.

3225
03:31:23,546 --> 03:31:25,178
ASHLEY: It's Undercommon? Okay.

3226
03:31:25,178 --> 03:31:26,313
SAM: I'm listening.

3227
03:31:26,313 --> 03:31:27,842
LAURA: I'm reading their lips.

3228
03:31:27,842 --> 03:31:41,326
MATT: Do you understand Undercommon? Okay, then
yeah. He looks back and goes, "It's been travel.

3229
03:31:41,326 --> 03:31:52,974
"They take care of me. We're here now." His hand
reaches over and grabs your hand and holds it for

3230
03:31:52,974 --> 03:31:59,306
a second. He goes, "We're here now to protect
you."

3231
03:31:59,306 --> 03:32:04,267
ASHLEY: Protect me from what?

3232
03:32:04,267 --> 03:32:07,750
MATT: "From the curse."

3233
03:32:07,750 --> 03:32:13,702
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

3234
03:32:13,702 --> 03:32:25,278
MATT: "I've been having visions of you. An angel
of light swallowed by dark."

3235
03:32:25,278 --> 03:32:34,067
ASHLEY: Okay. Are these just dreams?

3236
03:32:34,067 --> 03:32:44,674
MATT: "They come often, and the dreams that come
often generally come to pass. There is a curse in

3237
03:32:44,674 --> 03:32:52,875
"our blood, and we wish to save you from that
curse." His fingers tighten a little bit on your

3238
03:32:52,875 --> 03:33:04,711
hand. Not in a painful way, but an emphatic hold.
"I'm worried for you. You're the only good one."

3239
03:33:04,711 --> 03:33:15,128
His hand releases your hand. He drools a little
bit and wipes it with his hand.

3240
03:33:15,128 --> 03:33:23,003
(laughter)

3241
03:33:23,003 --> 03:33:29,301
ASHLEY: I take a spoon of peanut butter. It's a
little bit easier. Here you go.

3242
03:33:29,301 --> 03:33:31,465
SAM: Like Mr. Ed.

3243
03:33:31,465 --> 03:33:32,720
ASHLEY: Yep.

3244
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:40,135
MATT: It dribbles out a little bit. "Unexpected."

3245
03:33:40,135 --> 03:33:44,804
ASHLEY: Sorry, the mix between the pork and peanut
butter. It's an interesting mix,

3246
03:33:44,804 --> 03:33:46,412
but it's Grog's favorite.

3247
03:33:46,412 --> 03:33:47,795
MATT: "It's good."

3248
03:33:47,795 --> 03:33:49,791
ASHLEY: It's a good mix!

3249
03:33:49,791 --> 03:33:51,574
MATT: You see him smiling now.

3250
03:33:51,574 --> 03:34:02,698
ASHLEY: Can you tell me about Astra? How did she
come into the picture?

3251
03:34:02,698 --> 03:34:19,410
MATT: "Astra met Johann about ten years ago. He
needed someone to nail him down. Spry, wily, prone

3252
03:34:19,410 --> 03:34:31,522
"to terrible choices. He's a stupid boy. Stupid,
stupid boy."

3253
03:34:31,522 --> 03:34:37,712
At which point, Johann, who's been talking, stops
and goes, in Undercommon,

3254
03:34:37,712 --> 03:34:43,169
"I can hear you, Dad. Anyway!"

3255
03:34:43,169 --> 03:34:57,838
"She's good to him. If she breaks his heart, I'll
kill her."

3256
03:34:57,838 --> 03:35:16,462
ASHLEY: There you go. And any word from my family?
My mother, anything? It's been a long time since I

3257
03:35:16,462 --> 03:35:18,120
talked to them.

3258
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:23,165
MATT: "They absconded east and got in a 
little trouble."

3259
03:35:23,237 --> 03:35:26,086
ASHLEY: That makes sense.

3260
03:35:26,086 --> 03:35:34,189
MATT: "It's just like my brother to do that. He's
the one who held

3261
03:35:34,189 --> 03:35:37,695
"the stupid gene on our generation."

3262
03:35:37,695 --> 03:35:40,539
ASHLEY: Yep.

3263
03:35:40,539 --> 03:35:44,124
MATT: "I'm tired now."

3264
03:35:44,183 --> 03:35:45,850
ASHLEY: Okay.

3265
03:35:45,850 --> 03:35:54,279
MATT: At which point, JB, who's been over there
talking with you and asking questions about the

3266
03:35:54,279 --> 03:36:03,394
castle and what accommodations there are, sees
Uncle Ogden get up. "Oh, Uncle, I'll help you. I'm

3267
03:36:03,394 --> 03:36:09,369
"so sorry, Lady Vex'ahlia." She stands up and walks
around and grabs the elbow.

3268
03:36:09,369 --> 03:36:11,460
"Uncle Ogden, are you tired?"

3269
03:36:11,460 --> 03:36:14,361
ASHLEY: I can have someone take him, if you'd like
to stay?

3270
03:36:14,361 --> 03:36:21,255
MATT: "He's very fragile. If you'd trust anyone to
take him?"

3271
03:36:21,255 --> 03:36:23,644
LAURA: I can do it, dear.

3272
03:36:23,644 --> 03:36:33,459
ASHLEY: Well. Yeah. You would like to stay with
him?

3273
03:36:33,459 --> 03:36:39,745
MATT: "It's what I'm used to, but if Lady
Vex'ahlia--"

3274
03:36:39,745 --> 03:36:42,805
LAURA: I would love to. I think your cousin wants
to speak with you.

3275
03:36:42,805 --> 03:36:43,940
ASHLEY: Great.

3276
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:46,661
MATT: At which point, as soon as you say that, she
smiles brightly and goes, "Actually, yes."

3277
03:36:46,661 --> 03:36:47,652
LAURA: Yes.

3278
03:36:47,652 --> 03:36:48,790
ASHLEY: Okay.

3279
03:36:48,790 --> 03:36:50,200
LAURA: Be on your guard, dear.

3280
03:36:50,200 --> 03:36:51,756
ASHLEY: Okay, I will. Check your pockets.

3281
03:36:51,756 --> 03:36:52,988
LAURA: Always.

3282
03:36:52,988 --> 03:37:06,183
MATT: She sits down next to you and begins asking
about, "I can't believe that you stepped into the

3283
03:37:06,183 --> 03:37:10,889
"same ridiculousness that Wilhand did and it's
brought you all this.

3284
03:37:10,889 --> 03:37:13,441
"We just thought he was an old coot."

3285
03:37:13,441 --> 03:37:24,467
ASHLEY: Well, he's all I've known and he's
wonderful. He's my family, since I left, and I'm

3286
03:37:24,467 --> 03:37:30,255
sorry I haven't really contacted you guys.

3287
03:37:30,255 --> 03:37:34,910
MATT: "It's all right. We make ourselves scarce on
purpose."

3288
03:37:34,910 --> 03:37:43,698
ASHLEY: Yeah. Well, so you've been taking care of
Ogden?

3289
03:37:43,698 --> 03:37:48,903
MATT: "We've been helping out, but mostly me,
yeah."

3290
03:37:48,903 --> 03:37:55,612
ASHLEY: Has he told you anything that he dreams
about?

3291
03:37:55,612 --> 03:38:02,509
MATT: You can see that she stiffens up a little
bit. "So he's already told you."

3292
03:38:02,509 --> 03:38:05,380
ASHLEY: Yes.

3293
03:38:05,380 --> 03:38:22,807
MATT: "I don't want to ruin an evening that's
going so well, but he's had visions. I'm worried

3294
03:38:22,807 --> 03:38:29,129
"about you. When we got your letter that-- we
didn't know how to find you. We didn't think that

3295
03:38:29,129 --> 03:38:34,887
"you were in the area. When your letter found us,
we thought maybe you weren't that far away, so we

3296
03:38:34,887 --> 03:38:37,819
"began to search our way along the Silver Cut."

3297
03:38:37,819 --> 03:38:43,791
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I insight check her again?

3298
03:38:43,791 --> 03:38:46,142
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

3299
03:38:46,142 --> 03:38:53,616
ASHLEY: I can't figure out what's going on. Ugh,
balls. Oh, wait. 16?

3300
03:38:53,616 --> 03:39:03,101
MATT: She's hard to read, in general. Even when
she was a kid, she was an odd duck. She seems

3301
03:39:03,101 --> 03:39:04,433
genuine.

3302
03:39:04,433 --> 03:39:15,203
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, how's everybody feeling? Are
you tired? Are you full? Is it bedtime? What's

3303
03:39:15,203 --> 03:39:16,226
going on?

3304
03:39:16,226 --> 03:39:18,717
SAM: I could talk to these people all night long.

3305
03:39:18,717 --> 03:39:19,645
ASHLEY: Well.

3306
03:39:19,645 --> 03:39:23,840
SAM: But if we should turn in?

3307
03:39:23,840 --> 03:39:30,102
MATT: You see Astra, who's been drinking deep of
one of the two fine bottles of red wine, is

3308
03:39:30,102 --> 03:39:38,106
drunkenly leaning with her arm around Johann's
arm. He's a little tipsy, but he's still in

3309
03:39:38,106 --> 03:39:42,368
conversation, talking to Grog. He's telling
embarrassing story after embarrassing story, and

3310
03:39:42,368 --> 03:39:47,692
since you're so eager and no one else really wants
to pay him as much mind. He's talking to the

3311
03:39:47,692 --> 03:39:50,211
table, but he's mainly focusing on you.

3312
03:39:50,211 --> 03:39:51,351
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3313
03:39:51,351 --> 03:40:02,840
MATT: As you begin helping Ogden, who, as you grab
his arm, he's shaking, and he has his cane as he

3314
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:07,601
moves along. His skin is very loose.

3315
03:40:07,601 --> 03:40:13,047
LAURA: Ogden, would you like me to help carry you,
or are you all right to walk?

3316
03:40:13,047 --> 03:40:16,584
MATT: "I can walk under my own power."

3317
03:40:16,584 --> 03:40:20,896
LAURA: Of course you can. Feel free to lean on me,
though.

3318
03:40:20,896 --> 03:40:22,970
MATT: "At the stairs."

3319
03:40:22,970 --> 03:40:24,197
LAURA: All right.

3320
03:40:24,197 --> 03:40:27,784
MATT: He's still looking off. As soon as you get
to the stairs, he gets about two steps and has to

3321
03:40:27,784 --> 03:40:30,309
stop and breathe, and another two stairs.

3322
03:40:30,309 --> 03:40:33,464
LAURA: I put my arm down so he can put as much
weight as he wants.

3323
03:40:33,464 --> 03:40:37,339
MATT: He leans into it and you eventually help him
up the staircase that spirals up to the second

3324
03:40:37,339 --> 03:40:39,451
floor and eventually lead him to his chambers.

3325
03:40:39,451 --> 03:40:46,929
LAURA: All right, and I start talking to him on
the way to his room in Undercommon. And ask him:

3326
03:40:46,929 --> 03:40:50,105
How long have you guys been on the road?

3327
03:40:50,105 --> 03:40:52,509
MATT: "Always."

3328
03:40:52,509 --> 03:40:53,960
LAURA: Always?

3329
03:40:53,960 --> 03:41:03,663
MATT: "By nature, we don't really put down roots."
Big old smile as he says roots, darkened, some

3330
03:41:03,663 --> 03:41:07,873
broken teeth. Heinous smell.

3331
03:41:07,873 --> 03:41:12,846
LAURA: Peanut butter and pork.

3332
03:41:12,846 --> 03:41:14,518
MATT: Yep.

3333
03:41:14,518 --> 03:41:22,449
LAURA: I couldn't help but overhear you talking to
Pike about dreams you've been having.

3334
03:41:22,449 --> 03:41:26,292
MATT: "Yes. Dreams."

3335
03:41:26,292 --> 03:41:29,030
LAURA: What kind of dreams?

3336
03:41:29,030 --> 03:41:32,312
MATT: "Terrible premonitions."

3337
03:41:32,312 --> 03:41:34,009
LAURA: Like what?

3338
03:41:34,009 --> 03:41:43,384
MATT: At this point, he stops and looks up towards
you as you're holding his arm, and he reaches up

3339
03:41:43,384 --> 03:41:50,327
and pulls the glasses shakily from the front of
his face and through his small dark brown beady

3340
03:41:50,327 --> 03:41:56,018
eyes, you see the whites at the sides are
bloodshot. He glances up and goes,

3341
03:41:56,018 --> 03:42:02,234
"The kinds of dreams that end a bloodline."

3342
03:42:02,234 --> 03:42:05,234
LAURA: Well, that sounds terrible.

3343
03:42:05,234 --> 03:42:09,879
MATT: "We're trying to find a way to stop it."

3344
03:42:09,879 --> 03:42:15,115
LAURA: Well, that's good. I would like to stop it,
as well. We all love Pike very much.

3345
03:42:15,115 --> 03:42:18,659
MATT: "Good. Then we came at the right time."

3346
03:42:18,659 --> 03:42:20,497
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

3347
03:42:20,497 --> 03:42:24,060
MATT: Go for it.

3348
03:42:24,060 --> 03:42:36,192
LAURA: That was almost. 21? 21.

3349
03:42:36,192 --> 03:42:37,846
SAM: Whispers!

3350
03:42:37,846 --> 03:42:39,013
LAURA: Yes!

3351
03:42:39,013 --> 03:42:42,696
SAM: So, Taliesin, what's the V? What's the V on
this shirt?

3352
03:42:42,696 --> 03:42:44,258
TALIESIN: The V on this shirt?

3353
03:42:44,258 --> 03:42:45,696
LIAM: It's a book.

3354
03:42:45,696 --> 03:42:47,800
TALIESIN: That looks to be a tome of some sort.

3355
03:42:47,800 --> 03:42:50,378
SAM: Who is represented by a book?

3356
03:42:50,378 --> 03:42:53,015
LIAM: The whole top row is reserved for Matthew.

3357
03:42:53,015 --> 03:42:55,859
SAM: Oh, okay. And what's the M in Machina?

3358
03:42:55,859 --> 03:42:58,900
TALIESIN: It appears to be some sort of very
naturalistic bow and arrow.

3359
03:42:58,900 --> 03:43:00,891
SAM: Who would that correspond to?

3360
03:43:00,891 --> 03:43:02,095
TALIESIN: Scanlan, I imagine.

3361
03:43:02,095 --> 03:43:04,430
SAM: Oh, yeah. That makes sense. And the A?

3362
03:43:04,430 --> 03:43:07,977
TALIESIN: The A appears to be a bird's mask and a
pistol.

3363
03:43:07,977 --> 03:43:09,248
SAM: Also Scanlan.

3364
03:43:09,248 --> 03:43:10,329
TALIESIN: Also Scanlan.

3365
03:43:10,329 --> 03:43:12,038
SAM: Yeah, sure. And the C?

3366
03:43:12,038 --> 03:43:17,013
TALIESIN: The C is some sort of natural wooden
crest of some kind.

3367
03:43:17,013 --> 03:43:20,452
LIAM: That's Grog taint.

3368
03:43:20,452 --> 03:43:21,716
SAM: Oh.

3369
03:43:21,716 --> 03:43:25,572
TALIESIN: In fact, this is entirely Grog and
Scanlan, which I think, it's about time.

3370
03:43:25,572 --> 03:43:33,494
LAURA: Well, Ogden. Are you all right getting into
your bed? Do you need any help with that?

3371
03:43:33,494 --> 03:43:37,119
MATT: "If you can get me to the edge of it, I can
manage."

3372
03:43:37,119 --> 03:43:44,017
LAURA: Well, of course. I hope you know that we're
here for you, with whatever you need, as long as

3373
03:43:44,017 --> 03:43:49,377
we're all here to help Pike. We love her like
family, as well.

3374
03:43:49,377 --> 03:43:54,213
MATT: "Good. She can use some family."

3375
03:43:54,213 --> 03:43:58,115
LAURA: Yes. Dark tidings.

3376
03:43:58,115 --> 03:44:01,774
MATT: "Dark tidings, indeed."

3377
03:44:01,774 --> 03:44:06,276
LAURA: Are we talking like falling into a pit or
are we talking like-- I'm going to walk him to the

3378
03:44:06,276 --> 03:44:07,586
bed and maybe like--

3379
03:44:07,586 --> 03:44:13,568
MATT: (raspy grunt) He gets up and leans the stick
off to the side, and it (thudding noise)

3380
03:44:13,652 --> 03:44:14,770
onto the ground.

3381
03:44:14,770 --> 03:44:16,725
LAURA: I'll crouch down and start untying his
little boots.

3382
03:44:16,725 --> 03:44:20,615
MATT: "That's all right. I can get that."

3383
03:44:20,615 --> 03:44:22,100
LAURA: I don't mind.

3384
03:44:22,100 --> 03:44:24,902
MATT: He leans back and lets you do it.

3385
03:44:24,902 --> 03:44:28,792
LAURA: What kind of dark things are we talking?

3386
03:44:28,792 --> 03:44:42,132
MATT: "There's a legend in the Trickfoots. Every
generation, one is born with the blood curse. One

3387
03:44:42,132 --> 03:44:52,266
"that carries with it the anger of someone slighted
when we first became Trickfoots. Maybe it's

3388
03:44:52,266 --> 03:45:03,892
"superstition, but every one of these individuals
died a horrible, painful death, screaming of a

3389
03:45:03,892 --> 03:45:15,190
"shadow that came for them. It's a myth, I know,
but these dreams are real, and I'd rather be

3390
03:45:15,190 --> 03:45:20,575
"careful and wrong than careless and right."

3391
03:45:20,575 --> 03:45:24,759
LAURA: Do you see the shadow in your dreams?

3392
03:45:24,759 --> 03:45:29,598
MATT: "Shapeless. Dark. Eyes like burning coals."

3393
03:45:29,598 --> 03:45:37,575
LAURA: Does that sound like the smoke demon that
we saw come out of Percy? Anything like that?

3394
03:45:37,647 --> 03:45:50,202
MATT: Shapeless, black shadow with red eyes sounds
similar, but Orthax was generally black smoke. Had

3395
03:45:50,262 --> 03:45:52,894
form, and the eyes were more of a yellow.

3396
03:45:52,894 --> 03:45:55,161
TALIESIN: The John Doe of demons, really.

3397
03:45:55,161 --> 03:46:03,147
LAURA: All right. How long have you been having
these dreams?

3398
03:46:03,147 --> 03:46:06,565
MATT: "Months."

3399
03:46:06,565 --> 03:46:11,019
LAURA: Have you ever witnessed it happen before?
Have you had the dreams about anyone else?

3400
03:46:11,019 --> 03:46:15,093
MATT: "Only once. I was very young."

3401
03:46:15,093 --> 03:46:20,981
LAURA: And they died.

3402
03:46:20,981 --> 03:46:22,845
MATT: "My brother."

3403
03:46:22,845 --> 03:46:24,209
LAURA: Really?

3404
03:46:24,209 --> 03:46:26,105
MATT: Theobold.

3405
03:46:26,105 --> 03:46:35,049
LAURA: And do you know who it is the Trickfoots
slighted in this myth?

3406
03:46:35,049 --> 03:46:40,821
MATT: "I don't know. This whole family is paranoid
and guards their secrets from each other.

3407
03:46:40,821 --> 03:46:47,630
"Anyway."

3408
03:46:47,630 --> 03:46:51,150
LAURA: I wish you a dreamless sleep. And he's
out.

3409
03:46:51,150 --> 03:46:53,734
(laughter)

3410
03:46:53,734 --> 03:46:58,893
LIAM: Random question. Do we see an obvious family
resemblance with Pike and any of them?

3411
03:46:58,893 --> 03:47:04,209
MATT: Make a perception check.

3412
03:47:04,209 --> 03:47:08,833
SAM: They all have a giant birthmark on their
face.

3413
03:47:08,833 --> 03:47:11,043
(laughter)

3414
03:47:11,043 --> 03:47:12,290
LIAM: 24.

3415
03:47:12,290 --> 03:47:16,447
MATT: As you've been paying attention to them most
of dinner. Mannerisms, everything. There are some

3416
03:47:16,447 --> 03:47:17,357
similarities.

3417
03:47:17,357 --> 03:47:19,001
LIAM: Facial features, I mean.

3418
03:47:19,001 --> 03:47:24,847
MATT: Yeah. They're not direct family. They're
cousins, uncle-- they're once removed from her

3419
03:47:24,847 --> 03:47:33,004
central nuclear family. But you do see
similarities in cheekbone structure, at least with

3420
03:47:33,004 --> 03:47:43,091
Johann, Ogden, and JB. Moreso with JB. It's hard
with the mustache with Johann. But there are some

3421
03:47:43,091 --> 03:47:48,940
similarities between JB and Pike, and you can't
help but envision these two cute little gnome

3422
03:47:48,940 --> 03:47:54,644
children playing together. These two dark-haired
female gnomes running around, and there may have

3423
03:47:54,644 --> 03:47:57,594
been an age when they could have been hard to tell
apart from each other.

3424
03:47:57,594 --> 03:48:00,274
LAURA: Ooh.

3425
03:48:00,274 --> 03:48:03,912
SAM: Swapped at birth?

3426
03:48:03,912 --> 03:48:05,623
LAURA: I know, right?

3427
03:48:05,623 --> 03:48:07,833
MARISHA: Freaky Friday!

3428
03:48:07,833 --> 03:48:12,405
ASHLEY: Oh man. Okay.

3429
03:48:12,405 --> 03:48:22,224
MATT: As Johann picks up Astra. "Anyway, it's been
a fantastic meal. I appreciate your hospitality,

3430
03:48:22,224 --> 03:48:26,600
"and I look forward to this grand tour you promised
tomorrow."

3431
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:30,288
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Anything you want to see, as
long as you've got more of those stories.

3432
03:48:30,288 --> 03:48:33,152
MATT: "Oh, I've got loads."

3433
03:48:33,152 --> 03:48:37,308
TALIESIN: I'm going to sneak next to JB really
quickly.

3434
03:48:37,308 --> 03:48:38,622
MATT: Okay.

3435
03:48:38,622 --> 03:48:46,850
TALIESIN: If you want a more proper and private
tour of the city, consider the offer open. Just

3436
03:48:46,850 --> 03:48:53,049
think about where you'd want to start. The offer
does stand, though. Have a good evening.

3437
03:48:53,049 --> 03:49:01,764
MATT: As you say this to her, she glances back and
says, "Very well. Under the needs of being

3438
03:49:01,764 --> 03:49:05,449
"upfront, as well, I want you to know that I'm not
interested."

3439
03:49:05,449 --> 03:49:09,091
(laughter)

3440
03:49:09,091 --> 03:49:11,060
TRAVIS: Thank you. That's what it totally sounded
like.

3441
03:49:11,060 --> 03:49:13,088
LAURA: It did sound like you were fucking
flirting.

3442
03:49:13,088 --> 03:49:16,889
TRAVIS: You want a proper tour of deez nuts?

3443
03:49:16,965 --> 03:49:20,150
(laughter)

3444
03:49:20,150 --> 03:49:24,909
TALIESIN: I don't think he's figured out what
she's talking about.

3445
03:49:24,909 --> 03:49:26,557
MATT: I don't think he has, either, no.

3446
03:49:26,557 --> 03:49:32,767
TALIESIN: Oh. I'm sorry, I thought that maybe
you'd want to see the-- and the-- oh.

3447
03:49:32,767 --> 03:49:34,621
Very well, then.

3448
03:49:34,621 --> 03:49:42,367
MATT: She looks over at Grog and goes, "Perhaps a
tour is in order, but just no.

3449
03:49:42,367 --> 03:49:43,912
"I'm not interested."

3450
03:49:43,912 --> 03:49:45,234
TALIESIN: In the tour?

3451
03:49:45,234 --> 03:49:47,010
MATT: "In the tour, yes."

3452
03:49:47,010 --> 03:49:53,454
TALIESIN: Oh! Yeah. I mean, no. Yes. No.

3453
03:49:53,454 --> 03:49:54,532
(laughter)

3454
03:49:54,532 --> 03:49:56,268
LIAM: Smooth as butter.

3455
03:49:56,268 --> 03:50:00,786
MATT: She gets up and walks away. "Good night,
everyone. Good night, Pike."

3456
03:50:00,786 --> 03:50:02,656
TALIESIN: How did she do that?

3457
03:50:02,656 --> 03:50:07,284
MATT: Eventually, all the gnomes have left and
you're all there, dumbfounded,

3458
03:50:07,284 --> 03:50:08,867
at the dinner table.

3459
03:50:08,867 --> 03:50:10,471
LAURA: I come back down.

3460
03:50:10,471 --> 03:50:12,548
ASHLEY: Check your pockets! Check your pockets.

3461
03:50:12,548 --> 03:50:16,334
LAURA: I had no valuables on me at all.

3462
03:50:16,334 --> 03:50:20,235
SAM: I have everything that I own on me. Am I
missing anything?

3463
03:50:20,507 --> 03:50:23,995
LAURA: I check my hair to make sure my brooch is
still in it.

3464
03:50:23,995 --> 03:50:27,393
MARISHA: I check my pouch and make sure my antlers
are still there.

3465
03:50:27,393 --> 03:50:31,253
MATT: You guys scan through, pat yourselves down.
Everything's in place.

3466
03:50:31,253 --> 03:50:34,109
SAM: I think they're lovely.

3467
03:50:34,109 --> 03:50:39,614
MARISHA: And I liked seeing you being bested.
Regardless of the people, it's still fun seeing

3468
03:50:39,614 --> 03:50:40,922
you being bested.

3469
03:50:40,922 --> 03:50:42,295
TALIESIN: Cheap shot, at best.

3470
03:50:42,295 --> 03:50:46,276
LIAM: You are very different from them.

3471
03:50:46,276 --> 03:50:47,494
ASHLEY: Yes.

3472
03:50:47,494 --> 03:50:48,908
LIAM: They are quirky.

3473
03:50:48,908 --> 03:50:50,412
LAURA: I mean, you're quirky.

3474
03:50:50,412 --> 03:50:58,614
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I mean, I haven't seen them in a
very long time. Since I was but a kid.

3475
03:50:58,614 --> 03:51:02,170
LIAM: Why did Pom-Pom take you out of there?

3476
03:51:02,170 --> 03:51:13,093
ASHLEY: Well, because he was different and had a
different life plan and because he became a cleric

3477
03:51:13,093 --> 03:51:19,631
and was the first of-- I don't know how far
back. I don't even know.

3478
03:51:19,713 --> 03:51:21,982
LIAM: And older than all of them.

3479
03:51:21,982 --> 03:51:30,718
ASHLEY: Yeah. And he saw that I was and decided--
we left. He took me when I was little, and we

3480
03:51:30,718 --> 03:51:41,326
left. There was a lot that happened, but I didn't
know where they were because they travel.

3481
03:51:41,326 --> 03:51:45,462
LIAM: They just got here, but what's your feel on
this?

3482
03:51:45,462 --> 03:51:53,637
ASHLEY: I don't know. I heard some things with
some discussions I had tonight, and I need to

3483
03:51:53,822 --> 03:51:58,885
figure out if they're true or not. We'll figure
out in the next few days,

3484
03:51:58,885 --> 03:52:01,705
just to see what's going on.

3485
03:52:01,705 --> 03:52:05,322
SAM: This dream that the old one talked about,
does that worry you?

3486
03:52:05,322 --> 03:52:06,690
ASHLEY: How do you know about that?

3487
03:52:06,690 --> 03:52:07,814
LIAM: You don't know that.

3488
03:52:07,814 --> 03:52:09,142
LAURA: He does. He was listening in.

3489
03:52:09,142 --> 03:52:10,299
LIAM: Oh, that's right.

3490
03:52:10,299 --> 03:52:12,025
LAURA: I actually talked to him a little bit about
that, as well.

3491
03:52:12,025 --> 03:52:12,800
ASHLEY: You did?

3492
03:52:12,800 --> 03:52:13,517
LAURA: Yeah.

3493
03:52:13,517 --> 03:52:14,586
TALIESIN: A dream? What dream?

3494
03:52:14,586 --> 03:52:15,739
ASHLEY: What did he say?

3495
03:52:15,739 --> 03:52:22,691
LAURA: He said that there was a thing in your
family. A blood curse. He seemed honest enough

3496
03:52:22,691 --> 03:52:31,171
when he was saying it. Said that people paid the
price for a slight someone made a long time ago,

3497
03:52:31,248 --> 03:52:37,488
and certain members of your family are cursed, and
he's had these premonitions, these dreams, before.

3498
03:52:37,488 --> 03:52:40,739
It was his brother who passed away a long time
ago.

3499
03:52:40,739 --> 03:52:45,989
ASHLEY: Yes, this is a thing.

3500
03:52:45,989 --> 03:52:48,340
LAURA: Have you heard about this?

3501
03:52:48,340 --> 03:52:53,008
MATT: You haven't because you haven't been with
most of the Trickfoots for most of your life.

3502
03:52:53,008 --> 03:52:54,233
ASHLEY: Okay.

3503
03:52:54,233 --> 03:52:59,370
MATT: You've been with Wilhand since you were very
young. You said six. He's not been eager to talk

3504
03:52:59,370 --> 03:53:06,495
about the family. You can see he resents the
Trickfoot clan, so you haven't heard of this,

3505
03:53:06,495 --> 03:53:09,564
but you also know very little about them.

3506
03:53:09,564 --> 03:53:12,334
LAURA: Wilhand never discussed it with you?

3507
03:53:12,573 --> 03:53:15,774
MARISHA: No premonitions of a curse from Wilhand?

3508
03:53:15,774 --> 03:53:27,469
ASHLEY: He didn't talk about the family. He wanted
to be separate from them and he didn't want me to

3509
03:53:27,469 --> 03:53:30,794
be influenced by them at all.

3510
03:53:30,794 --> 03:53:38,621
MARISHA: Hang on. I don't mean to question
everything, but Wilhand defected from the whole

3511
03:53:38,621 --> 03:53:46,882
family and became a cleric, but he never mentioned
anything of a curse? Why did he become a cleric?

3512
03:53:46,882 --> 03:53:50,443
TALIESIN: I see your reasoning.

3513
03:53:50,443 --> 03:53:52,953
MARISHA: That seems like a dichotomy there.

3514
03:53:52,953 --> 03:53:54,973
TALIESIN: It actually makes perfect sense to me.

3515
03:53:54,973 --> 03:53:57,491
TRAVIS: He likes helping people.

3516
03:53:57,491 --> 03:54:05,921
MARISHA: Or he's terrified of some superstitious
curse. Maybe both?

3517
03:54:05,921 --> 03:54:07,764
ASHLEY: Maybe both.

3518
03:54:07,764 --> 03:54:17,112
LIAM: We trust you, and Wilhand raised you, so
Wilhand must have his head screwed on straight.

3519
03:54:17,112 --> 03:54:22,604
TALIESIN: I'm going to say you're in a room of
people who were raised by-- at least 60 percent of

3520
03:54:22,604 --> 03:54:25,698
the time, ridiculous people who have their head
screwed on straight.

3521
03:54:25,698 --> 03:54:28,367
MARISHA: That's accurate.

3522
03:54:28,367 --> 03:54:31,460
LAURA: Maybe we should ask him about it?

3523
03:54:31,460 --> 03:54:37,840
LIAM: That's where I was going. Is there any merit
in trying to get a hold of Wilhand right now, while

3524
03:54:37,840 --> 03:54:39,087
they're here?

3525
03:54:39,087 --> 03:54:41,519
ASHLEY: Can we, from here?

3526
03:54:41,519 --> 03:54:46,561
MATT: He's in Westruun right now. It is also late
in the evening.

3527
03:54:46,561 --> 03:54:50,611
MARISHA: I can get us anywhere very quickly.

3528
03:54:50,611 --> 03:54:52,289
SAM: Tomorrow we should go visit him?

3529
03:54:52,289 --> 03:54:53,212
LAURA: Yeah.

3530
03:54:53,212 --> 03:54:55,147
LIAM: Yeah. I don't think they're going to burn
down the castle.

3531
03:54:55,147 --> 03:54:58,829
LAURA: Maybe while they're taking a tour, we bamf
to Westruun for just a minute.

3532
03:54:58,829 --> 03:55:04,491
TALIESIN: I don't necessarily know if-- do you
want to bamf, or do you just want to talk? We can

3533
03:55:04,491 --> 03:55:07,291
probably just talk to him, or maybe we could have
him sent for.

3534
03:55:07,291 --> 03:55:10,644
LIAM: Do you remember our conversations with
Wilhand when we were in Westruun?

3535
03:55:10,644 --> 03:55:11,666
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3536
03:55:11,666 --> 03:55:13,640
LIAM: They were a little squirrely.

3537
03:55:13,640 --> 03:55:15,912
TALIESIN: I'm a little worried about leaving them
here unattended.

3538
03:55:15,912 --> 03:55:17,795
LAURA: Some of us can stay.

3539
03:55:17,795 --> 03:55:20,085
MARISHA: I think it would be a half-and-half
situation.

3540
03:55:20,085 --> 03:55:21,531
LAURA: Split the party!

3541
03:55:21,606 --> 03:55:24,093
ALL: Split the party!

3542
03:55:24,093 --> 03:55:31,967
ASHLEY: We could. As you guys know, Wilhand is a
little-- he's in his older years.

3543
03:55:31,967 --> 03:55:33,278
LAURA: We'll try to keep it quick.

3544
03:55:33,278 --> 03:55:34,643
ASHLEY: But we could try to keep it quick.

3545
03:55:34,643 --> 03:55:36,213
LAURA: In and out, ask him a few questions.

3546
03:55:36,213 --> 03:55:41,886
MARISHA: And Wilhand is the brother of Ogden?

3547
03:55:41,886 --> 03:55:43,290
LAURA: No.

3548
03:55:43,290 --> 03:55:45,010
LIAM: No, he's older than that.

3549
03:55:45,010 --> 03:55:47,513
MATT: Yeah, Wilhand is older than Ogden.

3550
03:55:47,513 --> 03:55:49,892
MARISHA: Wilhand's older than Ogden?!

3551
03:55:49,892 --> 03:55:51,502
ASHLEY: Wilhand's older than Ogden.

3552
03:55:51,502 --> 03:55:54,607
MARISHA: I thought Ogden was as old as life
itself!

3553
03:55:54,607 --> 03:55:56,458
TRAVIS: No, Ogden did a lot of drugs when he was
younger.

3554
03:55:56,458 --> 03:55:57,563
LAURA: Ogden's had a hard life.

3555
03:55:57,563 --> 03:56:00,953
SAM: He's got to be at least 150 or 200 years
old.

3556
03:56:00,953 --> 03:56:09,131
MATT: Ogden looks like he's older, but his
physicality is not based on age as much as it's

3557
03:56:09,131 --> 03:56:10,205
based on--

3558
03:56:10,205 --> 03:56:11,817
MARISHA: He had a Mick Jagger lifestyle.

3559
03:56:11,817 --> 03:56:13,685
MATT: Something akin to that, I guess you'd say.

3560
03:56:13,685 --> 03:56:14,673
MARISHA: All right.

3561
03:56:14,673 --> 03:56:16,035
TALIESIN: Or at least a Tom Waits one.

3562
03:56:16,035 --> 03:56:17,081
MATT: Yeah.

3563
03:56:17,081 --> 03:56:19,725
ASHLEY: Let's circle back tomorrow.

3564
03:56:19,725 --> 03:56:20,837
MARISHA: All right.

3565
03:56:20,837 --> 03:56:26,714
ASHLEY: And while they're doing the tour, maybe we
can pop over real quick and I think that would be

3566
03:56:26,714 --> 03:56:30,570
better than him seeing them here.

3567
03:56:30,570 --> 03:56:34,987
LIAM: Even as an outsider, that seems a little
ugh.

3568
03:56:34,987 --> 03:56:36,231
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3569
03:56:36,231 --> 03:56:40,021
TALIESIN: Grog, you'll take the loud ones tomorrow
and I'll take the quiet ones?

3570
03:56:40,021 --> 03:56:42,569
TRAVIS: Wait, what? I thought I get them all.

3571
03:56:42,569 --> 03:56:43,568
TALIESIN: Do you want to get them all?

3572
03:56:43,568 --> 03:56:45,847
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't they want all to be on my
tour?

3573
03:56:45,847 --> 03:56:47,854
LAURA: Maybe you could do the tour together?

3574
03:56:47,854 --> 03:56:51,066
MARISHA: Maybe you could do a Grog tour and then a
Percy tour.

3575
03:56:51,066 --> 03:56:53,320
LIAM: Or you could assist Grog.

3576
03:56:53,320 --> 03:56:58,661
TALIESIN: Because you asked so nicely. Also, I was
thinking the carpet might be a fine way of moving

3577
03:56:58,661 --> 03:57:00,144
them around the city.

3578
03:57:00,144 --> 03:57:02,443
LAURA: Oh! That is actually a wonderful idea.

3579
03:57:02,443 --> 03:57:04,082
ASHLEY: They would be pretty fascinated by that.

3580
03:57:04,082 --> 03:57:06,380
LAURA: Quite distracted.

3581
03:57:06,380 --> 03:57:13,066
LIAM: You know, the Grand Poobah needs an
assistant.

3582
03:57:13,066 --> 03:57:18,708
TRAVIS: Oh. Perhaps.

3583
03:57:18,708 --> 03:57:22,512
LIAM: It's only befitting of your station that
Percival aid you in such a fashion.

3584
03:57:22,512 --> 03:57:25,136
TRAVIS: Yes. Quite.

3585
03:57:25,136 --> 03:57:28,678
MARISHA: The two masters of the city. Of course.

3586
03:57:28,678 --> 03:57:33,024
TRAVIS: My history of the city is unrivaled.

3587
03:57:33,024 --> 03:57:37,814
TALIESIN: I will definitely agree that there are
sections of this city I would absolutely agree

3588
03:57:37,814 --> 03:57:40,007
that you are the master of, at this point.

3589
03:57:40,007 --> 03:57:41,230
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3590
03:57:41,230 --> 03:57:43,473
(laughter)

3591
03:57:43,473 --> 03:57:47,663
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's going to be a lot of
brothels and bars.

3592
03:57:47,663 --> 03:57:54,516
MARISHA: "And this was my first hook-up, and this
was the scene of my second hook-up."

3593
03:57:54,587 --> 03:57:57,943
TRAVIS: Yeah. This is a big tree.

3594
03:57:57,943 --> 03:58:01,182
MATT: I'm excited for this.

3595
03:58:01,182 --> 03:58:03,902
TALIESIN: I am so excited for this.

3596
03:58:03,902 --> 03:58:09,132
MATT: So, as you all eventually find yourselves
resting for the evening, contemplating the plans

3597
03:58:09,132 --> 03:58:13,587
to take first thing in the morning, we'll go ahead
and close tonight's episode there. We'll pick this

3598
03:58:13,587 --> 03:58:14,780
up next week.

3599
03:58:14,780 --> 03:58:16,487
LAURA: Wait, you're not going to be here next
week?

3600
03:58:16,487 --> 03:58:17,999
ASHLEY: I will. I'll just be a little late.

3601
03:58:17,999 --> 03:58:20,184
MARISHA: Sprinting from the airport.

3602
03:58:20,184 --> 03:58:21,049
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3603
03:58:21,049 --> 03:58:21,959
LAURA: Cool.

3604
03:58:21,959 --> 03:58:24,569
TALIESIN: We'll do the tour first, while you guys
are off freaking out with the--

3605
03:58:24,569 --> 03:58:26,004
MARISHA: Bamfing?

3606
03:58:26,004 --> 03:58:26,995
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3607
03:58:26,995 --> 03:58:33,263
MATT: We'll stall if we need to. We'll make it
happen. All righty, guys. Well, thank you so much

3608
03:58:33,263 --> 03:58:37,168
for watching tonight. I hope you enjoyed it as
much as we did.

3609
03:58:37,168 --> 03:58:39,477
MARISHA: We're all a year older now!

3610
03:58:39,477 --> 03:58:40,755
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3611
03:58:40,755 --> 03:58:42,458
MARISHA: We're older!

3612
03:58:42,458 --> 03:58:44,495
TRAVIS: Grog is 14.

3613
03:58:44,495 --> 03:58:49,691
MATT: We'll be back here next Thursday, 7PM Pacific,
as usual. Until then, have a wonderful weekend and

3614
03:58:49,754 --> 03:58:52,669
is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys.

3615
03:58:52,669 --> 03:58:54,346
MARISHA: Go buy t-shirts!

3616
03:58:54,346 --> 04:05:35,434
