1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:05,113
MATT: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role,
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:11,188
around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job,
Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were

3
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:18,455
off last week. I'm doing much better, for those
who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed

4
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:25,887
you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So
yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead

5
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:29,407
and get into some announcements real fast.
First off, tonight we have our fantastic

6
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:31,915
sponsor, Shadow of War!

7
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:37,127
TRAVIS: Shadow of War! Oh shit!

8
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,889
LAURA: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?

9
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:48,257
MATT: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the
game. It comes out October 10th, actually.

10
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,802
SAM: And the full name of the game is Middle
Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,977
looking for it alphabetically.

12
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,928
TRAVIS: The sequel to Middle Earth: Shadow of
<i>Mordor.</i>

13
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:03,264
SAM: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling
our asses off. I played a little character known

14
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:11,687
as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording
sessions.

15
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:14,783
TRAVIS: I remember talking to you! I was
Commanding Orc 1.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,572
SAM: Oh, nice.

17
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:27,057
MATT: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the
Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm

18
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,132
pretty excited about that.

19
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:29,513
LAURA: Oh, nice!

20
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:35,744
LIAM: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's
prestigious.

21
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,540
SAM: You were in it, right? No?

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,144
LIAM: I'm in the first one.

23
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:42,496
SAM: Oh, what did you do in the first one?

24
00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:49,622
LIAM: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was
me.

25
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:51,002
SAM: Laura, were you in it?

26
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:56,803
LAURA: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.

27
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,141
LIAM: You play a sword?!

28
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:04,623
LAURA: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf,
right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be

29
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,431
about my character.

30
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,148
SAM: Do you have a number after your character?

31
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:16,758
LAURA: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest
thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I

32
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:21,408
saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and
Vax.

33
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,448
MATT: That's pretty great.

34
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:26,448
LAURA: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick.
So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and

35
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:33,305
she wears feathery armor. It's so
freaking cool! So basically, it's like if

36
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,300
Vax was a girl, which is Vex.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,187
TRAVIS: But with the sex appeal of Grog.

38
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,792
LAURA: Of course, baby.

39
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,740
MATT: I will never forget being at the Shadow of
War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,129
and then going, "Has that even been announced
yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched

41
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,863
Laura wither away into a shell of a human
before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced."

42
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:53,995
And you reverted.

43
00:02:53,995 --> 00:03:00,135
LAURA: Even at this very moment, as I said it,
aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"

44
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:06,144
LIAM: They scare you so bad that, even when it's
official, I'm like "I'm in the--"

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,670
TRAVIS: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis
system has been improved on from last time.

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,971
We can testify.

47
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:16,735
SAM: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of
this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand

48
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:23,204
new live-action trailer that will take you near
the game? No! Right <i>into</i> the game. Soon we'll

49
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,596
need to choose whether to save or slay. During the
break tonight, they're going to be showing off

50
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:33,937
some awesome videos from the game. It drops
October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our

51
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,748
voices in the game as you slay us.

52
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:42,670
TRAVIS: And make us rise to the higher echelons of
the orc order.

53
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,227
MATT: By the way, if you haven't played the
previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the

54
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:51,005
coolest things I've played in many games in a long
time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and

55
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:56,036
pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then
to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very

56
00:03:56,036 --> 00:04:01,852
top. So you have nothing but generals from
Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because

57
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,046
that would be pretty cool.

58
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,370
LIAM: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.

59
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,094
LIAM, TRAVIS, and LAURA: Ranger!

60
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:18,451
MATT: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you,
Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're

61
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:21,398
excited about the game, and hope you are, too.

62
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:31,987
Also, there's been a lot of insane weather
tragedies that have been in the news recently. I

63
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:37,139
want to make sure that everyone knows that if you
want to help support relief for both of the

64
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,996
hurricanes that have come and torn through the
U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate

65
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:46,618
and be part of that. It'll be available in the
chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight,

66
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:53,941
so if you have the opportunity to help out, I
highly recommend it. Come help these people that

67
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:59,766
have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so.
Give what you can. I've given, and we really

68
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,617
appreciate that support.

69
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:04,742
TRAVIS: They'll let you delineate between Harvey
and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over

70
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:09,902
the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J.
Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma,

71
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:13,781
the damage is still accruing.

72
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:18,722
MATT: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well,
and I have family out there that endured it. It's

73
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:28,823
very close to me. So if you can, greatly
appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.

74
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:32,338
LAURA: This feels so weird to say after you
mentioned that.

75
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,888
TRAVIS: Nah, but we make happy stuff.

76
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:38,502
LAURA: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're
wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it

77
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,611
matches your eyeballs so beautifully.

78
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,726
TRAVIS: Ooh!

79
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:47,755
MATT: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to
make it really better.

80
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,034
SAM: Are we selling those in the store?

81
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,428
MATT: The back brace?

82
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:59,681
TRAVIS: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20
hours a week? We've got something for you!

83
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,220
LIAM: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on
that back brace.

84
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,968
(groaning)

85
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:05,068
LAURA: Next time.

86
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:06,992
MATT: Next time.

87
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,425
LIAM: No next time!

88
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:15,275
LAURA: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the
store. Go check them out. There's tank tops.

89
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:21,513
They're really cool; they're cheaper because they
are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger,

90
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:26,975
Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the
Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's

91
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:32,616
getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the
store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check

92
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:41,658
it out. We have hats and we have key chains and
necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards,

93
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:46,981
and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep
your eyes peeled.

94
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:51,745
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys,
we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,774
released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com
has all the information for it. So if you want to

96
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:00,127
listen to the podcast, or your friends have been
like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want

97
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,464
to hear it."

98
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,901
LAURA: I want to watch it, but I don't want to
<i>watch</i> it.

99
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,572
MATT: It's good for commutes.

100
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:10,721
MARISHA: Also, clarification, speaking of saying
things prematurely before I should have. I've

101
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:14,969
gotten a lot of questions being like, "What
happened to that plan of rolling out one a day

102
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:21,095
once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to
be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said

103
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:26,625
it, and then I looked down at the announcement
sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But

104
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:33,471
do not announce this part." Which, why was it even
on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.

105
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,952
MATT: To be fair, I remember looking down at the
sheet as you were announcing it.

106
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:42,065
MARISHA: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to
happen because they're easier to do in batch. So

107
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,602
ten at a time. That's what you get.

108
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:48,320
TALIESIN: It's like one cookie at a time. You
can't bake one cookie at a time.

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,711
MARISHA: It's just better to do them in a block.

110
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:58,115
MATT: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We
announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue

111
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:04,244
mini-series comic book. We announced last week
that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm

112
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,890
super excited about.

113
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,157
TRAVIS: DM is very excited.

114
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:14,249
MATT: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I
was probably in fourth grade when I got into the

115
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:21,483
Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize
there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan

116
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:27,827
of them ever since. Being able to take this into
their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First

117
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:30,313
issue drops on the 20th, guys.

118
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:37,467
MARISHA: The digital issue. The first issue
releases digitally this coming Wednesday.

119
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,310
SAM: Is it good? I haven't read it.

120
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,710
LAURA: It's so good!

121
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,224
SAM: Why have you all read it and I haven't?

122
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,025
MARISHA: Because you don't read your emails.

123
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,308
SAM: Yeah, that's fair.

124
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,463
LIAM: You show up ten minutes after we start, you
leave an hour before we end the game every week.

125
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:58,468
SAM: That's true.

126
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:02,503
MATT: So that's coming up. It will be on
Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle,

127
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:07,436
Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good
friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by

128
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:11,929
our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter
community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris

129
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:15,248
Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So
look out for that next week.

130
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:18,384
LIAM: Looks fucking <i>awesome</i>! The writing is
<i>awesome</i>! The art is <i>awesome</i>!

131
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,590
MATT: What he said.

132
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,597
LAURA: Did you already say about the physical
copies, too? When those will be released?

133
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,037
MATT: We'll have a trade available in spring
2018.

134
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:30,791
LIAM: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle
Earth.

135
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:37,421
MATT: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have
Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm

136
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:49,915
Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian.
We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So

137
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:53,603
look for that next week. All the Critical Role
episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone

138
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:58,970
back and added the bells and whistles, the
information, the stats, everything, for all the

139
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,078
episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you
ever watched it there, it's all updated.

140
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,491
SAM: I really should check my email!

141
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:10,544
TALIESIN: We would miss this sense of wonder
that we get to share with the community.

142
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,492
It's really nice.

143
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:17,148
MARISHA: They get your unbridled reaction.

144
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:20,286
TALIESIN: It's like watching Home Alone next to
Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much

145
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,593
out of it.

146
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:27,051
MATT: All righty. Last few things. One: this is
Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch.

147
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:31,457
Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch
has a special promotion where subscriptions are

148
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:36,264
half off for new subs for every Twitch channel,
including this one. So if you've been watching and

149
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:41,588
you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never
really felt like you can give the full $5, it's

150
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:45,511
half off this month. So if you want to subscribe
to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just

151
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:51,027
giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank
you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and

152
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,247
Travis, you are going to be at an event soon,
aren't you?

153
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:59,284
TRAVIS: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be
at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of

154
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:04,025
September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be
there with other people like Jennifer Hale and

155
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:08,122
people like that. But we're going to be there.
Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.

156
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:09,753
LAURA: Give a high-five.

157
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,115
MARISHA: I love Atlanta.

158
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:15,445
TRAVIS: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that
aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I

159
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:20,401
want to do. We're not going to have time for that.
And then, also, in the middle of November, we're

160
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:25,447
going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are
going for two weeks. We're going to be in

161
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,964
Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies--
what?

162
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:30,965
LAURA: I've got to get my passport.

163
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,459
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

164
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,828
LIAM: Expedite!

165
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,392
TRAVIS: So barring Laura's passport showing up--

166
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:42,493
MATT: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly.
That's how much it costs to expedite.

167
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,642
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm
going to write a note in my calendar.

168
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,485
TRAVIS: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If
you're there, you want to see us, come

169
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,084
see maybe just me.

170
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,920
(laughter)

171
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,218
SAM: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon,
saying--

172
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,195
LAURA: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel
free.

173
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:05,334
TRAVIS: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's
going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.

174
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,826
LAURA: I'm writing an email to myself.

175
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:11,182
MARISHA: Australia? Is that when we got
caught with having to have those weird

176
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:14,384
travel visas, as well?

177
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:17,520
MATT: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.

178
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,941
MARISHA: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the
airport. And then they're like, "You have to have

179
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,411
one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily,
you can do it online.

180
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:29,708
TRAVIS: Oh, I totally have that covered.

181
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,928
MATT: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so
much. Thank you for dealing with our long

182
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:39,329
announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I
think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's

183
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,204
episode of Critical Role.

184
00:12:42,204 --> 00:14:12,665
[dramatic music]

185
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:23,030
MATT: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's
everything targeting Scanlan in this battle?

186
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:29,802
Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox
Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray

187
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:36,943
with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying
King, discovered that he had brought the city of

188
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:44,949
Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of
Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon

189
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:53,227
gathering allies to assail this region, you
discovered that it was shifting, moving. And

190
00:14:53,227 --> 00:15:01,225
apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial
earth titan had been risen and began marching its

191
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:06,579
way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded
at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of

192
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,005
magical barrier.

193
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:15,508
With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back
and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their

194
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:25,799
wings, you made your way southward. Quickly
depositing yourselves within a waterfall,

195
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:32,653
expelling opening towards the hip of this large
titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to

196
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:40,129
the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth
elemental shards, you began to make your way

197
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:47,611
through the catacombs, the long ruined and
abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you

198
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:55,341
encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where
you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical

199
00:15:55,341 --> 00:16:01,881
item, and dealt with some fun traps in the
process. Then, continuing to follow where this

200
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:07,175
route led you upward, hopefully towards the
underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you

201
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:14,604
uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did
battle with some undead trolls that immediately

202
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:20,246
rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy
them, and make your way out through a small cavern

203
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:25,175
that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out
of the way. You all began to squeeze through the

204
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:28,331
opening to find the next length of your journey.

205
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:34,630
And that's where we left off. As you guys all
crawl through this recently cleared opening, you

206
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:42,273
come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or
so feet wide in places with elements of the

207
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:47,126
ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are
scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each

208
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:53,631
impact of the feet of the titan you're currently
riding within. It seems to be going at a steady

209
00:16:53,631 --> 00:17:01,120
incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet
ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to

210
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,645
45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.

211
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:12,406
SAM: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?

212
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,738
MATT: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?

213
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:25,171
SAM: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed
to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.

214
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:29,695
LIAM: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a
little ahead of everybody and start looking for

215
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,840
traps or anything hinky.

216
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,748
TRAVIS: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little
scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait.

217
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,765
Oh, he's dead.

218
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:42,064
LIAM: Did anybody see that guy?

219
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,072
TRAVIS: Nope.

220
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,165
LAURA: Yeah, we did. We saw him.

221
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,381
MATT: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there,
yeah.

222
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,991
LIAM: Nobody asked me about him.

223
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:50,488
LAURA: No, because you did a good job of killing
that.

224
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:57,314
LIAM: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating
flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a

225
00:17:57,314 --> 00:18:00,106
time table, yeah?

226
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:06,759
LAURA: We should keep moving upwards, I'm
assuming?

227
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,869
SAM: Did we get any items recently?

228
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:12,235
TRAVIS: No, I picked up that hammer that was
hitting me in the face.

229
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,849
LAURA: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?

230
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,309
SAM: Yeah, what does it do?

231
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,637
TALIESIN: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.

232
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:25,820
MARISHA: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our
items?

233
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,990
LAURA: I think we maybe should do that, actually.

234
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,028
SAM: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out
potions?

235
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:34,099
TRAVIS: We all have at least the one superior from
the brass dragon.

236
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,523
LIAM: Are we going to take a little 20-minute
breather here?

237
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:43,211
SAM: This is just for us to remember what we're
doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're

238
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:46,303
on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does
anyone need to heal?

239
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:47,927
MARISHA: We just stopped, right?

240
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:52,389
MATT: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle
with the trolls where you guys began to look about

241
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:56,085
the inside of the vault. And that's where the part
of the exit collapsed.

242
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,761
TRAVIS: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll
some hit dice?

243
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:03,011
MARISHA: You dug things out?

244
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,941
LAURA: But he was doing something? He was reading,
or something.

245
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:10,435
SAM: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or
something. And it took an hour.

246
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:15,492
TRAVIS: I clearly do not remember this. That's
right, I remember. I don't remember what I read,

247
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,686
but I remember.

248
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,160
SAM: It just said, "Do not enter."

249
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,895
TRAVIS: Yep. There were things.

250
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,906
LIAM: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and
standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying

251
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:31,173
to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the
Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.

252
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,621
MATT: All righty. Necrotic it is.

253
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:39,019
TRAVIS: We also need to be on the lookout for that
sword, remember? In the story?

254
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,919
SAM: The sword of Kas?

255
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,109
TRAVIS: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled,
high-perception people.

256
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,641
LAURA: All right.

257
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,819
TALIESIN: I literally can't see anything.

258
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,522
LAURA: Wait, we have light.

259
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,535
MARISHA: (whoosh)

260
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:56,105
LAURA: Yeah, see?

261
00:19:56,105 --> 00:20:00,432
MATT: Between her hand, his dagger, and
Pike's mace, you have a few light sources

262
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,116
that you guys maintain.

263
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,163
LAURA: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last
time.

264
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:12,204
MATT: But do keep in mind that light sources also
do make you a bright beacon in dark places.

265
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:15,930
LAURA: Probably your hands are less noticeable
than Pike's mace.

266
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,464
LIAM: Oh, I don't know.

267
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:21,184
TALIESIN: I think they would be less
intimidated by a glowing mace than by

268
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,356
glowing hands, at this point.

269
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,787
MATT: Glowing hands is like a small torch
firelight. The Mace of Disruption--

270
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,861
LIAM: Is like a headlamp.

271
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,857
LAURA: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.

272
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:34,507
LIAM: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."

273
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,303
LAURA: That sounded just like her.

274
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,353
SAM: She's turning more and more Canadian as you
go.

275
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:47,709
LIAM: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.

276
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,422
MATT: So if I could have a marching order,
please?

277
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:53,056
LIAM: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.

278
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:57,227
LAURA: Did you want this acid-resistant armor?
You'd at least be resistant to acid.

279
00:20:57,227 --> 00:21:05,898
TRAVIS: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll
be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then

280
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,535
me. Who wants to be behind?

281
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,475
TALIESIN: I'll be behind you.

282
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:15,080
MATT: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?

283
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,866
LAURA: Yeah, Trinket is out.

284
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,771
MATT: Percy's after Grog.

285
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:20,853
MARISHA: Me.

286
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:29,220
MATT: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan
holding up the rear. All righty, there you go.

287
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,005
Have that marked down. How far ahead are you
tracking?

288
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,228
LIAM: 20 feet.

289
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:39,144
MATT: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way
up the incline, and it is loose rock in this

290
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:43,867
tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid
and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and

291
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:50,128
you have to be careful as you progress up the
incline based on how much it continues upward to

292
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:51,612
keep your footing.

293
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:52,638
LAURA: Brother.

294
00:21:52,638 --> 00:21:53,549
LIAM: Yeah?

295
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,736
LAURA: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.

296
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:58,697
LIAM: I turn around and look at her and go: all
right.

297
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:00,919
LAURA: You said you're 20 fucking feet
in front of me, I'm using my fucking

298
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:02,437
earring to whisper to you.

299
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:05,151
LIAM: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy
to hear.

300
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:07,764
LAURA: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all
right?

301
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:21,017
LIAM: I love you. Perception check. Investigation
for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.

302
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:28,254
MATT: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you
progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel

303
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:33,386
seems to be pincering a bit the further you go.
The sides of the walls begin to close in and

304
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:41,679
eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the
15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way

305
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,676
into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about
three feet wide.

306
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:50,481
SAM: How tall?

307
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,775
MATT: About five and half, six feet tall?

308
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:56,776
TALIESIN: Is this pressure by design, or
is this what's been done to the

309
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:59,312
structure by the transformation?

310
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:03,147
MATT: You'll probably have to get closer to see.
Where you are currently, it looks like part of the

311
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:10,667
tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and
elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth

312
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,015
that at one point was packed at the sides.

313
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,422
LAURA: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?

314
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:15,882
MATT: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.

315
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:18,463
TRAVIS: How's it look?

316
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:23,548
LIAM: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60
feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?

317
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:31,145
MATT: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to
about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that

318
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,839
up until the outside of your visual range.

319
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:42,710
LIAM: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why
don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.

320
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,962
ALL: Wait.

321
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:49,806
LAURA: Do you want me to fly up there?

322
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,942
LIAM: Well, will you go with me?

323
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:55,034
LAURA: Of course. Can you not use your wings?

324
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:55,822
LIAM: They're gone.

325
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,834
LAURA: Well, then hop on.

326
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,546
LIAM: This could be the last time we do this. Come
on.

327
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:05,501
SAM: Oh god.

328
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:08,377
LIAM: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.

329
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:09,898
LAURA: You don't know that!

330
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,321
LIAM: It's scripted!

331
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:22,209
(laughter)

332
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:25,804
MARISHA: That's going to be a Reddit thread
later.

333
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:30,444
LAURA: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?

334
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:32,772
LIAM: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.

335
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:36,589
MATT: Not if you haven't recast it because after
the short rest it would've been gone.

336
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:39,945
LAURA: Should I cast that on us?

337
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:40,861
LIAM: Yes.

338
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:45,756
LAURA: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a
proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're

339
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:53,954
fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting
it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at

340
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:57,186
the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not
going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.

341
00:24:57,186 --> 00:25:00,615
LIAM: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can
see.

342
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,220
LAURA: And then come back down.

343
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,435
LIAM: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go
even further up 60 feet--

344
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:09,392
LAURA: All right. As long as everybody's within 60
feet of me. Because we're getting really close and

345
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:14,467
I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.

346
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,375
TALIESIN: That's right. I forgot about the ring.

347
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,644
LIAM: All right. Let's do that.

348
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,605
MATT: So as you guys glide up on the broom,
stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth

349
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:27,251
check, please.

350
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:30,304
TRAVIS: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.

351
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,133
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

352
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:35,324
TRAVIS: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made
me Vecna.

353
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:39,377
LAURA: 30.

354
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,922
LIAM: 29.

355
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:43,234
LAURA: 30.

356
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:52,024
MATT: All right. That's impressive. So as you both
quietly coast your way past this entrance way,

357
00:25:52,024 --> 00:25:57,149
squeezing into this two and a half,
three-foot-wide location, you get just within the

358
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:03,645
60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off
the broom and make your way quietly up to the

359
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:11,288
other side of the range. You get about 30 feet
beyond the broom before your vision meets where

360
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:20,082
this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there
is a solid, rocky blockage.

361
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,076
LAURA: What do you see?

362
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:29,225
LIAM: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's
blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a

363
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:32,631
closer look to see if we could get through.

364
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:35,337
LAURA: Well, get a fucking closer look.

365
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:37,816
TALIESIN: If we have to, we can just have Grog
beat it down.

366
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:39,704
LAURA: Yes, but quiet is the key word.

367
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:43,425
TALIESIN: Is it? We can try and time it to a
step.

368
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:48,734
LIAM: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to
it. Looking for any traps.

369
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:52,675
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check as
you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as

370
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:56,705
the incline is now towards the end getting more
and more steep.

371
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,644
LIAM: Get ready to catch me.

372
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:01,422
LAURA: I'm going to hover.

373
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:08,181
LIAM: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a
19, so 21.

374
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:12,104
MATT: Deftly, you manage to find the proper
handholds and pull your strength up as the final

375
00:27:12,104 --> 00:27:17,997
bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight
carrying situation, and you come to the edge of

376
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:28,855
the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a
rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or

377
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:34,669
been placed to close. It looks to be one solid
rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about

378
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,068
four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one
solid piece of rock.

379
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:47,968
LIAM: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey.
I'm not getting through this, you're not.

380
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,405
Maybe Kiki can.

381
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:53,926
LAURA: Do we see any other openings?

382
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:56,674
MATT: This would be a perception check.

383
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:03,486
SAM: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying
attention to the cadence of the steps to see if

384
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:06,921
they change in any discernible way.

385
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:11,264
MARISHA: That's what we're doing. While they do
that, we're timing the steps out.

386
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,499
MATT: Make a perception check.

387
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:15,308
LAURA: 20.

388
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:16,977
MATT: 20? Okay.

389
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,813
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Ugh.

390
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:19,667
SAM: 15.

391
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:20,787
MARISHA: 15.

392
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:22,216
TALIESIN: 12.

393
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:29,951
MATT: It's not that difficult to discern the
pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan

394
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:37,513
shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's
pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely

395
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:43,197
changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you
feel as they're going about this is because it's

396
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:50,693
stepping on or through terrain that is not flat.
But it is a pretty discernible pattern.

397
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:53,721
TALIESIN: We could go have Grog smash it
down in tempo with the steps so that the

398
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:56,390
sound will be covered.

399
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,642
TRAVIS: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop
pipe.

400
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:01,909
TALIESIN: I was thinking of the Tainted Love
Levi's commercial.

401
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,599
LAURA: Do I see any other--

402
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,542
MATT: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock
and the more you glance about with each impacting

403
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:18,839
footfall, you see two or three errant rocks
go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble

404
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:20,414
down the incline.

405
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:25,478
LAURA: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This
doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel.

406
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:29,684
Hop on the broom, darling.

407
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,327
TALIESIN: I like the idea of you punching this at
the appropriate moment.

408
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,985
MARISHA: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.

409
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:41,077
TRAVIS: Well, that's what's most important. Are
the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?

410
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:44,683
MATT: Yeah.

411
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,343
TRAVIS: Can I go into a rage?

412
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:47,950
MATT: You may.

413
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,432
TRAVIS: And I would like to try and bash the shit
out of this--

414
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:52,642
TALIESIN and LAURA: In tempo.

415
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:59,194
MATT: This is a tight tunnel for you. You
have to crouch down, round your shoulders

416
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:00,600
as you're doing it.

417
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,640
TRAVIS: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.

418
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,502
MATT: Make an athletics check. With advantage,
because you are raging.

419
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:15,852
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.

420
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:26,076
MATT: Okay. Here's the scenario: Vex and Vax, as
you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look

421
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:30,058
down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner
comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety

422
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:36,310
of the space? You watch as this angry goliath
starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does

423
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,830
not appear to be much of any space you could
squeeze through.

424
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,334
LIAM: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?

425
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:43,675
LAURA: Grog?

426
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,116
TRAVIS: What? (angry panting)

427
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:51,101
LAURA: Can we pass under his legs or something?

428
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,476
LIAM: Dive, dive!

429
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,348
LAURA: Rage quietly.

430
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:57,880
MATT: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics
check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.

431
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:05,796
LAURA: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.

432
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:08,140
LIAM: 30-something.

433
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,871
MATT: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping)
out the back, between his monstrous goliath

434
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:22,008
thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you
who are still waiting a little further down the

435
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:29,458
tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back
end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to

436
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:40,766
two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However,
you eventually climb your way angrily up to the

437
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:46,099
very edge and there is the boulder, there, and
you're about to go right towards it, but then stop

438
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,932
and remember what your friends had said, and you
wait patiently for the pattern of the next

439
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:53,168
footfall. (boom)

440
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:58,299
TRAVIS: (punch impact)

441
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:03,385
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

442
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:06,551
TRAVIS: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say
it.

443
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,111
LAURA: But you do extra damage because you're--

444
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:13,744
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.

445
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:16,848
MATT: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.

446
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:21,239
TRAVIS: Okay, 1d4. Four!

447
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,333
MATT: Plus your strength modifier and your rage
damage.

448
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:31,585
TRAVIS: Eight. 27.

449
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:36,251
MATT: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?

450
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,568
TRAVIS: No.

451
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:40,685
MATT: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.

452
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:43,055
TRAVIS: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's
with the axe.

453
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:48,533
MATT: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your
overall. So your rage damage at this level is

454
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:54,905
four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12
plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of

455
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,020
bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this
rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and

456
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:10,133
cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away,
and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from

457
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:16,466
the opposite side, as it rests back into place,
heavily damaged.

458
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:22,885
TALIESIN: (singing) Wait for it to go again and
bump, bump, bump.

459
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:28,815
MATT: You wait for the next footfall of the titan
(impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do

460
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,175
you want to go for another punch?

461
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,305
TRAVIS: Do I hit it now?

462
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,849
SAM, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Yes!

463
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:37,422
MATT: Roll another attack.

464
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:41,287
TRAVIS: Oh, that's even better. 33.

465
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,757
MATT: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another
d4.

466
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,098
TRAVIS: Two plus eight. Ten plus--

467
00:33:47,098 --> 00:33:48,657
MATT: Four for rage damage.

468
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:50,913
TRAVIS: 14.

469
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:56,704
MATT: All right, and so with that, your fist slams
into the boulder a second time. It explodes and

470
00:33:56,704 --> 00:34:03,138
shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock
and stone goes firing across the distance of this

471
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:11,429
tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering
firelight. As you're sitting there seething with

472
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,236
anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each
breath--

473
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:18,297
TRAVIS: I'm so swole right now.

474
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:24,349
MATT: Yeah. You can see above you, this
entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide,

475
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:30,830
ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and
left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the

476
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,029
right and front, and then to the back and behind
you that direction.

477
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:37,386
TRAVIS: Hey guys, it's a Z.

478
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:41,574
LAURA: What do you see?

479
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:44,095
TRAVIS: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little
more.

480
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:50,590
MARISHA: So you know the first and last letter of
the alphabet? Don't worry about it.

481
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,669
MATT: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way
and step up into it. You can see now a

482
00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:04,266
well-constructed hallway. You can see there are
stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the

483
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:12,118
angular architecture of this hall as it comes up
into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a

484
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:19,880
bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even
surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make

485
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,221
and seems to be a continuation of some sort of
structure or pathway of Thomara.

486
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:26,723
TALIESIN: Let the twins take a look. I think it
would be safe.

487
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:34,973
TRAVIS: It's a well-constructed hallway of
dwarvish make. (groans)

488
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:40,198
LAURA: We sneak under his legs again to like see
what's going on.

489
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:48,641
MATT: You guys all eventually make your way up
into this hallway. Now, it is still a five

490
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:53,287
-foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in
single-file progression one way or the other.

491
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:55,957
LIAM: Twins are already at the top looking for
problems.

492
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:59,515
MATT: Right, so you guys would be able to because
it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be

493
00:35:59,515 --> 00:36:04,419
able to occupy a space above another party member
if you were both on the broom.

494
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:10,331
LAURA: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you
should be off the broom because you might check

495
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:15,093
for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and
ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--

496
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:18,764
LIAM: I'll take the lower half. That's called
advantage.

497
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:23,035
MATT: So go ahead and make and investigation
check.

498
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,514
LAURA: Both of us or just him with advantage?

499
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:31,223
MATT: Both of you separately because you're
investigating different elements of the hallway.

500
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,981
LIAM: 18 for me.

501
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:42,961
LAURA: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!

502
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:50,236
MATT: As you guys glance up and focus on the
surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes

503
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:57,609
for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave
in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed,

504
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:04,254
broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway
slabs that originally held up that part are

505
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:11,097
collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across
the ground. The other direction you go continues

506
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:19,088
on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet
ahead of you.

507
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:22,796
LAURA: We should go toward the cave in, don't you
think?

508
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:31,188
MATT: There are small built-in sconces that are
magically, perpetually burning firelight.

509
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:38,591
LAURA: Does this seem like there's any traps that
could be set off as we walk towards the--?

510
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:42,410
MATT: You do not notice anything, as you were
investigating specifically for that.

511
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,061
TALIESIN: Check the sconces, see if they trigger
something.

512
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,493
LAURA: I'll look at the sconces.

513
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:48,449
LIAM: <i>I</i> will look at the sconces.

514
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:50,043
LAURA: I'll look at them better.

515
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:57,740
MATT: I included that as your perception for traps
above. You did not notice anything that would be

516
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,459
considered a trap.

517
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:05,535
LAURA: You guys, there's no traps. We should head
towards this darkened room.

518
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:09,312
MARISHA: Save a life, check a sconce.

519
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:15,437
LIAM: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the
hall and continue that search.

520
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:21,316
MATT: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber
is there before you. As you get to the edge, you

521
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:30,983
can see a little bit the very inside of this
chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your

522
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:34,903
mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard
a raven.

523
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:40,686
LIAM: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt.
Everywhere.

524
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:48,733
MATT: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the
room. And that's as far as you can see into the

525
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:52,175
chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes
dark.

526
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,842
TALIESIN: People don't install those unless
there's something awful that needs to be done.

527
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:59,259
MARISHA: Do we have any idea how far we've
climbed?

528
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,908
MATT: You can make a nature check.

529
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:04,673
LIAM: And do I need to make a extra roll to look
for traps around this brazier?

530
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:08,369
MATT: If you want to enter the chamber, you can.
You're too far away.

531
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:14,610
MARISHA: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!

532
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:19,108
MATT: As you take a moment, and think back to how
far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and

533
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:27,341
where you entered this titan and to where the city
of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you

534
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:34,046
gather you're close to halfway through its torso,
if not a little beyond it.

535
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,502
MARSHIA: If not a little beyond?

536
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,339
SAM: He's big.

537
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,110
MARISHA: Okay, all right. Nipple level?

538
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,273
MATT: Sternum.

539
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:46,085
MARISHA: The heartburn region? A little acid
reflux?

540
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:51,480
LIAM: We are the acid reflux.

541
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,444
MARISHA: He has acid resistance against reflux.

542
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:59,515
LIAM: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.

543
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:01,507
MATT: You scoot up to the edge.

544
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:05,269
LIAM: I don't want to go further than roughly 60
feet away from my sister.

545
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,812
MATT: Right. Which will put you right at the
entryway to this chamber.

546
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:11,628
LIAM: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.

547
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:15,651
LAURA: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you
want to go in?

548
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:17,555
LIAM: I did.

549
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:19,094
LAURA: Feel free.

550
00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:20,854
MATT: So the marching order is the same? We got
the twins up the front.

551
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,245
TALIESIN: Yeah. I like this marching order.

552
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:27,129
LIAM: Let this shit blow up in my face, so
everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to

553
00:40:27,129 --> 00:40:31,189
pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the
room.

554
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:34,910
LAURA: I think I was more stealthy than you a
moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in

555
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,160
front of me?

556
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,674
LIAM: I love you anyway. Here I go.

557
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,897
TALIESIN: He's better at blowing up than you are,
dear.

558
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,367
TRAVIS: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so
let him go.

559
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:47,298
LIAM: Slower than this titan's footfalls.

560
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:54,416
MATT: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's
a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark

561
00:40:54,416 --> 00:41:06,655
iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about
40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the

562
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:11,267
center where the brazier is and the corners are
slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight,

563
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:18,897
hard corner. There is no exit door currently
visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room

564
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:25,920
looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall,
five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in

565
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,220
intricate gold and brass that sits
across the chamber on the opposite side

566
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,470
of where you entered.

567
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,749
LIAM: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room,
right?

568
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:40,091
MATT: Iron room with a brass edge around this
eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can

569
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:43,409
tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit
of light there is behind you, you can see your

570
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:46,613
silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.

571
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:49,060
LIAM: So doorway, brazier, mirror.

572
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,361
MATT: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber
seems fairly empty.

573
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:52,967
LAURA: And the brazier is complete dark?

574
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:53,923
MATT: Yeah.

575
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:54,887
LAURA: It's cold.

576
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,806
TALIESIN: Oh no.

577
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,041
LAURA: This is not good.

578
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,453
LIAM: Look at his fake innocent face.

579
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:00,964
SAM: I think it's just a vanity.

580
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:10,178
LIAM: Going to check for traps from right here to
start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a

581
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:16,318
jellyfish. That is a 17.

582
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:24,628
MATT: You begin to glance around the chamber, best
you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small

583
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:31,225
gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in
the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror

584
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:39,412
side. One's embedded within the upper
left and right corners and within the lower

585
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:42,198
left and right corners.

586
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:43,761
SAM: Pressure knobs?

587
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,843
MATT: They're like little buttons that are gold
piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right

588
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:50,512
and left corners and the lower left and right
corners.

589
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,135
TRAVIS: Push them!

590
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:58,152
LIAM: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad
history with pushing buttons.

591
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:03,283
MATT: You also notice very thin light
piles of black residue or ash scattered in

592
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:04,598
places across the floor.

593
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:13,485
MARISHA: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator.
I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No?

594
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:18,138
What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)

595
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,804
LIAM: (sighs) So we've got buttons.

596
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,224
MARISHA: Or lasers.

597
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,630
TRAVIS: Incinerator or lasers.

598
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,241
MARISHA: Laser incinerator! Duh!

599
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:33,925
TRAVIS: That was a great jump for me and my
character.

600
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:38,140
LIAM: If something stupid is going to happen here,
I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So

601
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:46,010
we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over
there, and buttons, yeah.

602
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,823
LAURA: Maybe the mirror is a door.

603
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:51,648
LIAM: I thought that, as well.

604
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:55,524
LAURA: Should we try to walk through it?

605
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:58,993
TALIESIN: Maybe a second interrogation room and
there's another room behind it, maybe?

606
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:02,069
LIAM: Can we get your hub up here, please?

607
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,295
TALIESIN: I am up here. I'm right here.

608
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:05,259
LIAM: Jesus!

609
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:09,683
LAURA: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't
hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the

610
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:12,331
mirror leaning or is it on the wall?

611
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:13,693
MATT: It's on the wall.

612
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,525
MARISHA: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't
curved. It's a square room.

613
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:21,121
MATT: It's a square room but the corners curve
ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and

614
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:25,933
in those curved corners on the side that the
mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's

615
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:29,171
these little buttons in the upper right and left
corner and the lower left and right.

616
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:33,777
LAURA: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the
ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?

617
00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:35,425
MATT: Mm. It's cold.

618
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:42,141
LIAM: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You
two do the thinking, all right? And I take

619
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:44,546
a step into the room.

620
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:46,035
MATT: Okay.

621
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:49,118
LIAM: What do I do?

622
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,089
LAURA: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.

623
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:53,123
TALIESIN: Tap the mirror.

624
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,476
TRAVIS: Light the brazier!

625
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,518
LAURA: We've done that before and we all
exploded.

626
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:00,220
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's Vax.

627
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,511
MARISHA: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some
of the ashy stuff?

628
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:06,108
MATT: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.

629
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:09,018
MARISHA: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.

630
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:15,236
LIAM: I scoop some ash. Lady of the
Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and

631
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:17,436
I pour it into her hands.

632
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:20,665
MARISHA: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this
ash feel like it's made out of?

633
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:22,185
SAM: Human bones.

634
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:27,462
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
(groans)

635
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:29,063
TALIESIN: Wow.

636
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:30,657
LAURA: No. What is it? (groans)

637
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:33,314
TRAVIS: Is it for real? You are lying!

638
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,961
LIAM: Look at that face! You are not lying!

639
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:41,136
MARISHA: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil.
I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance

640
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:45,257
of the universe.

641
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:53,654
MATT: It's light ash. You're not sure what the
basis of what may have burned here. You see more

642
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:56,832
of it gathered near where the brazier is.

643
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:59,950
TALIESIN: Is it in piles that would be about
human-amount of ash?

644
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,477
MATT: Make an investigation check.

645
00:46:01,477 --> 00:46:09,072
TALIESIN: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah,
natural 20. That'll do.

646
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:11,989
SAM: Only ones and 20s tonight.

647
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:17,250
LIAM: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up,
heads down.

648
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:23,485
MATT: More of it seems to be around the base of
the brazier, but you do see there are thicker

649
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:27,921
traces at different places throughout the
chamber.

650
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:31,922
TALIESIN: It's organic ash?

651
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:38,339
MATT: You've dealt with different types of ash.
The carbon appears to have been organic-based at

652
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:40,221
some point.

653
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:45,068
LIAM: I pull off my belt and say: Hello, Simon.
Wake him up.

654
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,059
MATT: Okay. (slithering)

655
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:51,191
LIAM: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.

656
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:54,655
LAURA: Simon, go through the mirror.

657
00:46:54,655 --> 00:47:01,202
LIAM: That's right. Go check out the mirror,
Simon, all right? Off you go.

658
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:04,106
TRAVIS: Are we still in the room?

659
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:06,706
LAURA: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one
in the room.

660
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:12,686
MATT: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the
mirror and presses up against it.

661
00:47:12,686 --> 00:47:15,413
LIAM: I dart back one step out of the room as it
happens.

662
00:47:15,413 --> 00:47:19,284
MATT: The snake trying to push up against the wall
but half of its body sliding against the mirror

663
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:23,066
before it eventually scoots off and lands. It
tries again, pushing against the mirror and then

664
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:24,879
eventually (sliding).

665
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:26,984
TALIESIN: I hate to say this, but tap the button?

666
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:35,883
LIAM: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up
the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.

667
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:43,818
MATT: The snake slithers around and makes its way.
It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal

668
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:52,234
bars that all curl up like a basket and then there
are bars that cross around it to hold the shape.

669
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:58,661
It looks like there are some long-burned,
blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a

670
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:04,866
long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and
curls up around the metal, comes around the top of

671
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:11,063
the outer rim of it, rests there.

672
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:16,085
LIAM: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The
nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps

673
00:48:16,085 --> 00:48:25,127
back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go
push those low buttons in the room?

674
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:26,278
MATT: Which one?

675
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,345
LIAM: There's two, right?

676
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:29,353
MATT: There's four on the opposite side.

677
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:34,256
LIAM: There's two high up. And I don't think he
can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to

678
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:38,029
walls. Get the one over here on the left first.

679
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:40,518
LAURA: What if we all have to push every button at
the same time?

680
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,324
LIAM: That's true. That could be.

681
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:45,047
MATT: Simon (slithering) moves over.

682
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,406
LIAM: I lean over to Percy, I say: science!

683
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:55,543
MATT: Hits the button. (click) Right on the
entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams

684
00:48:55,543 --> 00:49:02,309
closed. Iron metal now closes off that
entranceway.

685
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:06,142
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch the door.

686
00:49:06,142 --> 00:49:08,849
SAM: And say goodbye.

687
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,568
TALIESIN: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?

688
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:13,357
MATT: It is beginning to get warm.

689
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:19,525
TALIESIN: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort
some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on

690
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:20,748
the outside of the door.

691
00:49:20,748 --> 00:49:21,894
MATT: Make an investigation check.

692
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:23,031
SAM: Is Vax in the room?

693
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:24,895
LIAM: No, I took two steps back from the door.

694
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,047
LAURA: No, nobody's in the room.

695
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,948
TALIESIN: Let's say that investigation was
somewhere around a seven?

696
00:49:29,948 --> 00:49:32,993
(laughter)

697
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:39,625
MATT: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls
that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a

698
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:43,583
perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the
entrance.

699
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,262
TRAVIS: No problem. I'll get it down.

700
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:46,942
LAURA: No!

701
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:53,794
LIAM: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item,
so I don't think he would be harmed by anything

702
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:57,132
going on in there, so why don't we give it five
minutes?

703
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:58,427
MARISHA: And maybe it'll open again.

704
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:00,499
LIAM: Yeah.

705
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:06,981
TRAVIS: Is there anything going on in the tunnel,
on the outside of this door, where we are?

706
00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:08,407
LAURA: Coming up from behind us?

707
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:09,678
MATT: Make a perception check.

708
00:50:09,678 --> 00:50:12,743
TRAVIS: Temperature check, anything like that?
Natural 20.

709
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:18,510
TALIESIN: We have been gone so long!

710
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,395
MATT: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find
middle math. It's only extremes.

711
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:27,339
LIAM: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks,
and it's all coming out now.

712
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:33,497
MATT: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of
the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be

713
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:43,563
catching your eye. It's still dark. About two
minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving

714
00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:48,404
a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat
emanating from it.

715
00:50:48,404 --> 00:50:51,756
TRAVIS: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway
that we are in right now, right?

716
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:54,154
MATT: I'd say, because of your perception
check, as you glance around, there does

717
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:55,568
not appear to be any ash.

718
00:50:55,568 --> 00:51:00,813
TRAVIS: I don't want that door to fucking open all
of a sudden.

719
00:51:00,813 --> 00:51:08,371
MATT: About five minutes go by as you guys are
waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to

720
00:51:08,371 --> 00:51:18,013
descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still
there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges

721
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:23,438
from the chamber. You all have to immediately
close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin

722
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:28,002
to step further back into the hallway. On the
inside of the room, you can see the black iron

723
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:39,134
interior of the chamber is also that same orangish
glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back

724
00:51:39,134 --> 00:51:44,023
and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly
begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening.

725
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:46,644
You're too far away to look. You make a perception
check to try and glance in?

726
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:47,968
LAURA: Can't you call to him?

727
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:49,401
LIAM: Simon? Come here, buddy.

728
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,838
MATT: There's no response.

729
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:55,091
LIAM: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he
could have turned back into a belt.

730
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:58,335
TALIESIN: What's he going to say if you call to
him? Was he going to say something?

731
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:09,086
LIAM: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers
creepers! Perception check? 29!

732
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:15,792
MATT: You glance past where the button was that it
hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.

733
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:18,565
LIAM: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.

734
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:25,764
LAURA: When you go pick him up and put him back on
your fucking waist.

735
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:29,112
MATT: Technically, since Simon's taken enough
damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot

736
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,018
turn back into a snake for the day.

737
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,493
LAURA: How about that unseen servant?

738
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:37,864
LIAM: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic,
that we either want to somehow push all four of

739
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:42,566
these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light
this brazier, or both.

740
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:45,532
LAURA: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it
look like it's hot?

741
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:48,456
SAM: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I
assume.

742
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,391
TRAVIS: Are there still charred wooden pieces in
the middle of it?

743
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:59,509
MATT: The pieces are still there, but it's black
carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn.

744
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,033
Whatever's been in there has been heated so much
to the point--

745
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:06,498
TRAVIS: It's not the source of the flame. Not for
that much heat.

746
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:10,490
MARISHA: If I was the person who designed this,
why would I put a failsafe in here?

747
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,366
LIAM: A way to get through that only the creator
would know how to use?

748
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:17,977
MARISHA: I feel like there's got to be another
entrance because we can see another room, right?

749
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:23,253
LAURA: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh,
Keyleth, that's our reflection.

750
00:53:23,253 --> 00:53:35,234
MARISHA: No, I know that, but a lot of things have
reflections.

751
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:38,776
LIAM: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be
dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that

752
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:44,065
sarcastic right now?

753
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:53,242
MARISHA: I go up to the mirror and check it out.
It's cooled off enough, right?

754
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:55,747
MATT: Well, no. If you guys want to take
a few minutes, you can wait until it

755
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,767
cools off, if you want to.

756
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,819
TALIESIN: Why don't we try pushing all four
buttons at once?

757
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:05,227
SAM: Wait, before we do that, I'm going
to enter the room and look around at

758
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:06,590
the walls and the ceiling.

759
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:13,367
MATT: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off.
It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully

760
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:15,821
cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.

761
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:24,921
SAM: I'm looking for markings, indications of
instructions, arrows, any hidden words--

762
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,975
MATT: Make an investigation check.

763
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,773
TRAVIS: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.

764
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:33,384
SAM: Ooh, a lot. 29.

765
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:50,286
TALIESIN: He's coming up with some bullshit.

766
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,403
MATT: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled
off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You

767
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:59,525
glance through. The ceiling and the walls all
appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of

768
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:04,910
dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from
whatever previously may have been incinerated in

769
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:11,819
here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side
of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you

770
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:21,800
see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection.
It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower

771
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,603
corner of the opposite side of the mirror as
you're glancing off across to the other side. As

772
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:32,378
you look over to the wall, of the room you're in,
there's no glow.

773
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:39,953
SAM: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?

774
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:44,862
MATT: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move
to the corner immediately to your right. You look

775
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:50,486
in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the
reflection of the corner opposite to you, right?

776
00:55:50,486 --> 00:55:54,962
Looking in that reflection, you can see this very
faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner,

777
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:59,916
but you glance over to the physical corner across
from you, and it's not there.

778
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:04,926
LAURA: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?

779
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:12,453
SAM: I think there's magical buttons in here and
we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the

780
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:17,244
mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the
same thing.

781
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:23,729
MATT: As you have this conversation and look back,
those two glowing sigils are gone.

782
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:25,071
SAM: Even in the mirror?

783
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:27,726
MATT: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is
now gone.

784
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:31,159
TRAVIS: But they're revealed by heat.

785
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,083
MARISHA: Where were they?

786
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:35,512
SAM: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.

787
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:41,307
MARISHA: I walk over and I heat them with my heat
hands.

788
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:47,260
MATT: Okay, so you take your hands and you put
them up near there. As you put your hands on the

789
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:52,640
wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance
through the reflection where she has her hands,

790
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,080
that symbol seems to be appearing again.

791
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,989
LAURA: What is the symbol of?

792
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,888
SAM: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?

793
00:56:58,888 --> 00:57:07,868
MATT: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol,
marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.

794
00:57:07,868 --> 00:57:12,013
SAM: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.

795
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:19,118
MATT: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a
variation on a spell that basically is a mark that

796
00:57:19,118 --> 00:57:24,843
a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as
their own. However, this is meant to be a basic

797
00:57:24,843 --> 00:57:33,893
marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind
it. It's just an indicator.

798
00:57:33,893 --> 00:57:41,487
SAM: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one.
Same marking?

799
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:45,508
MATT: As you head down there, the one above begins
to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol

800
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:47,255
appears below.

801
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:53,462
SAM: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls
and see if we can find other ones.

802
00:57:53,462 --> 00:57:56,773
MATT: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go
to the other corners, the ones that were

803
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:01,798
immediately toward the entrance of where you
walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols,

804
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:05,952
mirroring where the buttons are on the far side
corners.

805
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:12,843
SAM: So we push those? But there's a hidden button
in there.

806
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:16,663
TRAVIS: When you're a big fire, the walking
thing--

807
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:18,288
MARISHA: A fire elemental.

808
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:25,903
TRAVIS: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you
should be in here.

809
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:35,127
LAURA: You should go in there, see if you can
disengage the trap.

810
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:38,880
LIAM: So you are impervious to being set on fire
or burned?

811
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,148
MARISHA: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.

812
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:44,837
LAURA: Can you do that?

813
00:58:44,837 --> 00:58:49,909
MARISHA: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took
a short rest, so yes, I can do that.

814
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:52,771
TRAVIS: We also have an unseen servant.

815
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:57,191
SAM: So we're going to need four people.

816
00:58:57,191 --> 00:59:01,506
MARISHA: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?

817
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:06,526
LIAM: Press all four buttons at once, although
we've got at least three sharpshooters--

818
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:14,129
SAM: Not the buttons that we can see. What are
these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.

819
00:59:14,177 --> 00:59:17,315
TRAVIS: It might be a depression on the wall or
something.

820
00:59:17,315 --> 00:59:19,877
MARISHA: But what if the buttons are correlated
with the symbols?

821
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:23,290
TALIESIN: Let's try pushing all four buttons.

822
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,011
TRAVIS: The regular buttons or the magic ones?

823
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,088
LIAM: Please stand by.

824
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:29,695
LAURA: I want to go look at where the symbol is
and see if it's a fucking button.

825
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:32,195
MARISHA: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's
nothing there, right?

826
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:33,573
SAM: Was there anything there?

827
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:36,539
MATT: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The
wall doesn't move.

828
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,256
MARISHA: It's just a wall.

829
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:42,426
TRAVIS: No depression, no toggle?

830
00:59:42,426 --> 00:59:44,750
MATT: Make an investigation check.

831
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:50,232
TRAVIS: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two.
17!

832
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:57,799
MATT: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at
the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you

833
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:04,173
get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale,
it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been

834
01:00:04,173 --> 01:00:12,031
slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters
away. You can see two lines, parallel to each

835
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:17,263
other, about an inch tall.

836
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:27,586
TRAVIS: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of
Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.

837
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,272
LAURA: What did you do?

838
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:33,329
TRAVIS: I breathed on the wall.

839
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,230
SAM: What do they do? What do these lines do?

840
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:38,285
MARISHA: I do a quick Gust cantrip.

841
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:45,049
MATT: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the
wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and

842
01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:50,781
the ash blows around the area. It creates an open
space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens

843
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:55,049
areas of the floor and the vicinity around
Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew

844
01:00:55,049 --> 01:01:02,529
the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now
clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.

845
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:06,348
LAURA: I fly up on my broom and do it to the
symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).

846
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:15,937
MATT: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and
it looks like--

847
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:19,884
MARISHA: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.

848
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,391
LIAM: How many people at home do you think have
figured this out already?

849
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,148
LAURA: We already figured it out!

850
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,418
SAM: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane
symbols?

851
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,083
LAURA: Yeah, to clear them out!

852
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:40,407
TRAVIS: If you're looking at the door we came in,
Grog blew on the lower right?

853
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:44,088
SAM: And that's two lines. Boom.

854
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:46,406
MATT: That would be lower right.

855
01:01:46,406 --> 01:01:48,359
TRAVIS: Two vertical lines.

856
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,605
MATT: Correct.

857
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:53,046
LAURA: I'm in the corner above Grog.

858
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:56,620
MATT: That would be upper right.

859
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,866
TALIESIN: I'm going to do bottom left.

860
01:01:58,866 --> 01:02:04,445
MATT: All right, you blow, and you watch as the
dust reveals. It's two more lines.

861
01:02:04,445 --> 01:02:07,303
LAURA: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to
be another--

862
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:11,607
TALIESIN: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and
(blows).

863
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,317
LIAM: Did you use your ascot?

864
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:17,544
TALIESIN: Yes, of course. That's what it's there
for. The back of it.

865
01:02:17,544 --> 01:02:21,758
LAURA: The one clean spot left on it.

866
01:02:21,758 --> 01:02:26,240
MATT: That one has four parallel lines.

867
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,980
LAURA: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy.
There was a reflection there, too, right?

868
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:39,961
SAM: Blow! Laura, blow!

869
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:44,289
LAURA: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as
I did it. It was really awkward.

870
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:47,880
MATT: All right, that one has a single line.

871
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,354
SAM: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?

872
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:56,966
LAURA: Is there one with three lines, or are there
any more areas we saw a reflection?

873
01:02:56,966 --> 01:03:03,232
TRAVIS: What about above the door? It is opposite
of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the

874
01:03:03,232 --> 01:03:04,483
other one's a door?

875
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:06,507
LAURA: Okay, I'll blow above the door.

876
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:08,965
LIAM: And I'm going to start blowing around the
mirror.

877
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:13,054
LAURA: We all walk around going (raspberries).

878
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:15,620
TRAVIS: Constitution check to see who passes out
first?

879
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:23,771
MATT: What was that?

880
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:26,316
TALIESIN: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?

881
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:34,372
MATT: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks
like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.

882
01:03:34,372 --> 01:03:41,218
TALIESIN: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the
frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these

883
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,688
symbols in the frame?

884
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:45,405
MATT: As you look in the actual frame itself, you
don't see anything that matches the symbols.

885
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:52,718
LAURA: What if these are numbers and the order you
have to push the buttons?

886
01:03:52,718 --> 01:03:54,519
SAM: Except we have two twos, and no three?

887
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:58,191
LAURA: I know. One, two, four!

888
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:05,713
TALIESIN: No, because you have to hit one, and
then you have to hit the two together--

889
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:15,660
SAM: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can
we do a sweep for more?

890
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,092
TRAVIS: Can I clear off the door area that we
walked through?

891
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:27,832
MATT: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing).
Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.

892
01:04:27,832 --> 01:04:31,390
MARISHA: I take my mantle and start doing a--

893
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:48,132
MATT: You clear that archway very well, around the
door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper

894
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:52,940
right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and
lower left corner of the doorframe.

895
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:57,053
TRAVIS: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know
runes.

896
01:04:57,053 --> 01:05:00,288
MATT: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven
language.

897
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,775
TRAVIS: The runes are part of the Dwarven
language, so I know them.

898
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,580
LAURA: Pike goes over and she helps you.

899
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:11,652
TRAVIS: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to
decipher what these symbols mean.

900
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:13,782
LAURA: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones
above the door!"

901
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:17,727
LIAM: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it
on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."

902
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:22,648
TRAVIS: I hold her up to the upper left corner of
the doorway.

903
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:32,383
MATT: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner.
Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents

904
01:05:32,383 --> 01:05:33,769
the number three.

905
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:37,157
TRAVIS: Three. All right. Now, to the upper
right-hand corner.

906
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:40,001
MATT: That is the number one.

907
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:45,347
TRAVIS: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say,
okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.

908
01:05:45,347 --> 01:05:48,354
MATT: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.

909
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:51,282
TRAVIS: And now the lower left-hand corner.

910
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:52,552
MATT: A four.

911
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:57,706
LAURA: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of
times you have to push the button!

912
01:05:57,706 --> 01:06:05,267
TALIESIN: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three,
four-four.

913
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:06,845
SAM: Possibly.

914
01:06:06,845 --> 01:06:09,259
LAURA: Wait, I think we reversed it.

915
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:17,423
LIAM: How long does your unseen servant last?

916
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:19,001
SAM: Not too long.

917
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:21,199
LIAM: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?

918
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:33,086
SAM: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have
to be close to it. How big is this room?

919
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:40,224
MATT: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the
brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.

920
01:06:40,224 --> 01:06:48,294
TALIESIN: Is our physicality of this map correct?
If we show you this?

921
01:06:48,294 --> 01:07:00,435
LIAM: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of
etherealness. You could potentially be standing in

922
01:07:00,435 --> 01:07:09,291
here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though.
Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in

923
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,896
here and not be in here.

924
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:15,315
SAM: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less
than 60 feet?

925
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:16,898
MATT: Yes.

926
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:26,232
SAM: Oh, then I can be out of the door. 
Am I right with what I wrote down there?

927
01:07:26,232 --> 01:07:30,845
MATT: All right, so this is the-- facing from the
inside--

928
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:39,924
SAM: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane.
Looking at the door that we came in. Right?

929
01:07:39,924 --> 01:07:44,671
MATT: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think
you guys got confused on that one.

930
01:07:44,671 --> 01:07:46,785
LAURA: I think me and Travis got it right.

931
01:07:46,785 --> 01:07:48,107
SAM: I think, Matt, you're wrong.

932
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:52,821
TRAVIS: I have the same thing as Laura.

933
01:07:52,821 --> 01:07:57,104
LIAM: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left
right left right A B A B.

934
01:07:57,104 --> 01:08:04,132
LAURA: I hope we passed the test.

935
01:08:04,132 --> 01:08:07,533
MATT: Okay.

936
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:09,435
LAURA: Did we get it right?

937
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:13,499
MATT: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm
limited in my reach right now.

938
01:08:13,499 --> 01:08:24,962
MARISHA: I love that we all did something similar
but all wrote something different. We're like,

939
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:26,909
numbers, somewhere!

940
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:33,552
MATT: Yep, almost. Almost.

941
01:08:33,552 --> 01:08:37,168
MARISHA: Did you help us, or are you just saying
"almost?"

942
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:42,165
MATT: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where
the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have

943
01:08:42,165 --> 01:08:43,470
the correct configuration.

944
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,378
LAURA: (victorious laughter)

945
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:53,383
MARISHA: I think this is right. I think you have
this. I think I have the right part of this and

946
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,120
you have the right part of this.

947
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,295
LAURA: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck
is correct.

948
01:08:58,295 --> 01:08:59,750
TRAVIS: Yes.

949
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:07,579
LAURA: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw
it. (counting)

950
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:19,058
SAM: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by--
I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!

951
01:09:19,058 --> 01:09:29,626
LAURA: Okay, so now we know the order to push the
buttons and the amount of times to push the

952
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:30,635
buttons.

953
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:32,130
SAM: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.

954
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:37,122
TRAVIS: Should we check around the mirror frame to
see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?

955
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:40,345
TALIESIN: I gave it a little bit of a rub.

956
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:45,146
MARISHA: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on
the mirror.

957
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:48,132
MATT: Okay. It taps.

958
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:52,845
TRAVIS: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame
and see if there's anything around the frame of

959
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:55,584
the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?

960
01:09:55,584 --> 01:09:57,546
MATT: Make an investigation check.

961
01:09:57,546 --> 01:09:59,343
TRAVIS: Three.

962
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:06,202
MATT: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but
eventually get some semblance of shine through.

963
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,691
Nothing catches your eye.

964
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:12,897
TRAVIS: It's clear. We found everything there is
to find.

965
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:17,531
MARISHA: Grog draws boobs on himself in the
reflection out of the ash.

966
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:29,106
SAM: All right, should we leave the room and have
Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right,

967
01:10:29,106 --> 01:10:32,443
we'll do that.

968
01:10:32,443 --> 01:10:37,446
LAURA: We step just outside the door again and let
his invisible servant push buttons.

969
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:43,530
LIAM: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does
whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes

970
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,082
buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.

971
01:10:46,082 --> 01:10:48,011
TALIESIN: Look out!

972
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,239
LIAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: (singing) Here comes
the Scanlan Man.

973
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:56,528
SAM: Would a person who cannot fly be able to
touch the top buttons?

974
01:10:56,528 --> 01:10:57,573
MATT: Nope.

975
01:10:57,573 --> 01:10:58,734
SAM: Shit.

976
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:05,561
TRAVIS: Well, there's no saying that it will
activate if we do it correctly.

977
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:11,237
LIAM: Also, what about shooting the button or
firing an arrow at a button?

978
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:14,715
LAURA: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.

979
01:11:14,715 --> 01:11:16,529
TALIESIN: How high up are the buttons?

980
01:11:16,529 --> 01:11:19,643
MATT: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.

981
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:25,703
TALIESIN: So if he had something that was-- if he
had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.

982
01:11:25,703 --> 01:11:29,025
LAURA: The buttons are on the side of the mirror,
so we could shoot arrows at them.

983
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:31,622
TALIESIN: But only if we're in there and then we
don't need an unseen servant to do it.

984
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:33,747
SAM: Want to give him a pole or something?

985
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,353
TALIESIN: Let's give him a stick.

986
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:38,887
SAM: Do we have a stick in the bag?

987
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:40,387
TRAVIS: I have a lance.

988
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:42,310
TALIESIN: Yeah, he has a lance.

989
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:46,133
TRAVIS: It's almost broken.

990
01:11:46,133 --> 01:11:50,267
TALIESIN: My god, it will finally be useful one
last time.

991
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:52,209
LIAM: We do have three trammels.

992
01:11:52,209 --> 01:12:00,431
TALIESIN: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm
with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!

993
01:12:00,431 --> 01:12:04,076
TRAVIS: You have a slightly splintered lance.

994
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:08,710
LAURA: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's
get through this room.

995
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,377
TALIESIN: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's
supposed to do.

996
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:18,170
SAM: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that
violating some-- he's not allowed to hold

997
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,545
weapons.

998
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:23,670
MATT: He can hold them. He can't attack; he
cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.

999
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:27,376
LIAM: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.

1000
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,818
MATT: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.

1001
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:37,104
SAM: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name
Simon Two.

1002
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:38,723
TALIESIN: Electric Boogaloo.

1003
01:12:38,723 --> 01:12:40,969
LIAM: Not cool, man, not cool.

1004
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:48,633
MATT: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and
you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground

1005
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:50,810
where two footfalls (landing noises).

1006
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:58,447
SAM: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're
going to go tell you what buttons to press over

1007
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:01,818
there, good speed-- good speed?

1008
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:04,532
(laughter)

1009
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:17,354
SAM: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like
burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him,

1010
01:13:17,354 --> 01:13:21,831
because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper
right? What do we start with?

1011
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:27,941
MARISHA: It's this. Tell him to do this.

1012
01:13:27,941 --> 01:13:29,546
LAURA: The reflection of that.

1013
01:13:29,546 --> 01:13:35,678
SAM: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh,
wait.

1014
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:41,554
LAURA: So the upper left corner from where we're
looking.

1015
01:13:41,554 --> 01:13:47,587
SAM: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this,
so project that across the room.

1016
01:13:47,587 --> 01:13:49,254
MATT: Okay.

1017
01:13:49,254 --> 01:13:51,561
SAM: Oh, that was the mistake.

1018
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,184
MATT: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.

1019
01:13:55,184 --> 01:14:00,069
SAM: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left.
Let's try that.

1020
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:10,645
MATT: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the
lance wobble, and it misses a couple times,

1021
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:19,235
(clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward.
The lance is pulled back and the button presses

1022
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,991
back out outward into its position.

1023
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:24,125
SAM: Any door?

1024
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:25,382
MATT: No door.

1025
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,467
LAURA: We'll know if we push it again then we did
it the wrong order.

1026
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:32,908
MATT: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the
button depresses.

1027
01:14:32,908 --> 01:14:34,953
TALIESIN: All right, keep going.

1028
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:38,117
SAM: So below it, two presses.

1029
01:14:38,117 --> 01:14:39,945
LAURA: In the corner, bottom corner.

1030
01:14:39,945 --> 01:14:41,742
SAM: Just like your name, Simon: two.

1031
01:14:41,742 --> 01:14:45,581
MATT: (clicking)

1032
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:51,089
SAM: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.

1033
01:14:51,089 --> 01:14:53,596
LAURA: Upper right-hand corner.

1034
01:14:53,596 --> 01:14:57,026
MATT: (clicking)

1035
01:14:57,026 --> 01:15:00,730
SAM: And then below that, bottom corner. Four
presses.

1036
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:16,067
MATT: (clicking)

1037
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:18,018
(laughter)

1038
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:23,275
MATT: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of
pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch

1039
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:28,318
as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of
a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as

1040
01:15:28,318 --> 01:15:34,460
it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until
eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an

1041
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,683
oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.

1042
01:15:37,683 --> 01:15:38,841
LAURA: Let's go in!

1043
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:41,402
MARISHA: I told you there was a room behind the
mirror.

1044
01:15:41,402 --> 01:15:45,187
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how
long it will stay open for.

1045
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:48,989
SAM: Simon Two is coming with us.

1046
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:54,638
MATT: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound
behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and

1047
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:59,801
squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket
had a hard enough time getting through the

1048
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:06,286
incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your
way through the opposite side, and as you all step

1049
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:08,884
through, the portal remains open for at least a
moment.

1050
01:16:08,884 --> 01:16:12,625
LAURA: Hey, we did it, guys.

1051
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,608
SAM and TRAVIS: We beat a door.

1052
01:16:15,608 --> 01:16:21,926
MARISHA: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested
a door.

1053
01:16:21,926 --> 01:16:26,537
LIAM: The last episode of the third campaign will
be a door that we do not open.

1054
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:37,716
MATT: So the darkness you step through leads into
a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone.

1055
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:46,150
Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall
or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few

1056
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:53,811
steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys
make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.

1057
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:55,437
LIAM: Can we see?

1058
01:16:55,437 --> 01:16:56,932
MARISHA: Can you see through it?

1059
01:16:56,932 --> 01:16:58,291
MATT: Through the mirror?

1060
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:01,876
LIAM: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch
black?

1061
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:09,205
MATT: You're in pitch black, but you guys with
darkvision can see there is a staircase not too

1062
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:11,756
far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this
next hallway.

1063
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:13,864
TRAVIS: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?

1064
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:15,182
MATT: Stone stairs.

1065
01:17:15,182 --> 01:17:16,723
LIAM: I've got a dagger out.

1066
01:17:16,723 --> 01:17:20,689
MATT: All right, lights up briefly and you get a
little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's

1067
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:29,692
gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're
made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps

1068
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:31,212
that are relatively shallow.

1069
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:34,385
TRAVIS: These are dwarven steps that are
relatively shallow.

1070
01:17:34,385 --> 01:17:36,082
SAM: We can see it, Grog.

1071
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:40,166
LIAM: Pike says, "That's actually right".

1072
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:45,863
LAURA: Is there any traps?

1073
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:47,852
MATT: You're welcome to search for traps.

1074
01:17:47,852 --> 01:17:55,978
LIAM: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs
and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it,

1075
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:59,692
but I'm still going and looking for traps.

1076
01:17:59,692 --> 01:18:02,190
MATT: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.

1077
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:07,619
LIAM: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been
counting ones as ones for a <i>long</i> time.

1078
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:11,649
MATT: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically
says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.

1079
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:14,500
SAM: Any roll?

1080
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,729
MATT: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has
to make.

1081
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:22,427
LIAM: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and
20s were king, but no.

1082
01:18:22,427 --> 01:18:25,781
LAURA: So he rolled way better than me because I
rolled a ten.

1083
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:28,635
LIAM: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.

1084
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:37,388
MATT: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things
about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45,

1085
01:18:37,388 --> 01:18:42,639
50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye
out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or

1086
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:49,099
strange, and the stairs now switch back into
another set. It's a small landing and then it

1087
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,339
continues upward.

1088
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:54,064
LIAM: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in
advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from

1089
01:18:54,064 --> 01:18:57,447
the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.

1090
01:18:57,447 --> 01:19:01,699
MARISHA: So it's a big 180, going right up?

1091
01:19:01,699 --> 01:19:07,250
MATT: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase
ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues

1092
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,632
upward and around.

1093
01:19:08,632 --> 01:19:09,694
LAURA: Do we hear anything?

1094
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:11,364
MATT: Make a perception check.

1095
01:19:11,364 --> 01:19:12,697
TALIESIN: I'll join in that perception.

1096
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:14,902
MATT: So you're joining them up the staircase?

1097
01:19:14,902 --> 01:19:17,216
TALIESIN: I'm behind. You know, the standard--

1098
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:18,631
MATT: All right, so you guys are keeping up.

1099
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,404
MARISHA: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the
fuck!

1100
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:22,229
TALIESIN: I got a 25.

1101
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:27,625
MATT: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and
people just cannot-- wow.

1102
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:32,707
LIAM: But do you remember when we were at home and
we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend

1103
01:19:32,707 --> 01:19:37,957
45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the
rules worked, what our names were, who you were.

1104
01:19:37,957 --> 01:19:40,490
TALIESIN: Vex is right.

1105
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,203
TRAVIS: 25, you said?

1106
01:19:43,203 --> 01:19:45,958
TALIESIN: 25.

1107
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:57,557
MATT: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting
in the distance is not the rumbling from the

1108
01:19:57,557 --> 01:20:04,886
ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems
to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear

1109
01:20:04,886 --> 01:20:09,844
dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the
stone floor and the steps, and every now and then

1110
01:20:09,844 --> 01:20:17,109
you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually
come to rest either near or below you. You

1111
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:21,689
continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a
third switchback that continues upward.

1112
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:23,526
LIAM: 40 feet in advance.

1113
01:20:23,526 --> 01:20:25,688
MARISHA: We are following behind.

1114
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:29,465
LAURA: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?

1115
01:20:29,465 --> 01:20:32,017
LIAM: I am. That is an 18, anyway.

1116
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:37,821
MARISHA: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our
blind human.

1117
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:41,995
MATT: Leading the old man forward.

1118
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:44,974
TALIESIN: (old man voice) Where's Steven?

1119
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:47,214
MARISHA: (laughs) Where's Steven?

1120
01:20:47,214 --> 01:20:55,887
MATT: You do not find any other traps. There's no
other issues that worry you upon this climb. You

1121
01:20:55,887 --> 01:21:01,734
do eventually come to the top of the third
switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight

1122
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:13,127
curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a
continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure

1123
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:23,378
that you had below, but it is curving around now,
in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual

1124
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:30,585
curve, the design in the structure here has a very
rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in

1125
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:31,474
sections.

1126
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:33,919
LIAM: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look
for traps.

1127
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:35,785
MATT: All right, go for it.

1128
01:21:35,785 --> 01:21:38,852
LIAM: Love it. That's an 18.

1129
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:49,629
MATT: Okay. Coming around the edge: no traps, no
plates. Nothing catches your attention. However,

1130
01:21:49,629 --> 01:21:59,475
this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into
a larger crevasse than the one that you previously

1131
01:21:59,475 --> 01:22:09,007
saw that held a number of city buildings of the
remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to

1132
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:15,589
120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the
stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the

1133
01:22:15,589 --> 01:22:25,629
edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light
here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish

1134
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:30,184
color that dots the edges of this interior
chamber.

1135
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:35,308
LIAM: And is it like where I killed that
motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?

1136
01:22:35,308 --> 01:22:40,192
MATT: Yes. This one is larger than the one you
were in before, and you can see just beyond your

1137
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:44,426
visual range, a number of these buildings,
partially crumbled in some places, some still

1138
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:51,633
standing obstinately against the ever-shifting
interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling

1139
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:56,814
upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher
just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly

1140
01:22:56,814 --> 01:23:07,836
see the images of dozens of thin bridges that
weave over themselves across different levels, up

1141
01:23:07,836 --> 01:23:09,142
into the higher portion.

1142
01:23:09,142 --> 01:23:14,249
LIAM: I want to confirm an intuition and use my
last Divine Sense and feel undead.

1143
01:23:14,249 --> 01:23:16,714
MATT: Okay, what's the range on that one?

1144
01:23:16,714 --> 01:23:18,628
LIAM: 60 feet.

1145
01:23:18,628 --> 01:23:25,776
MATT: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within
the 60-foot range.

1146
01:23:25,776 --> 01:23:32,966
MARISHA: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're
in its chest cavity.

1147
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:40,372
LIAM: Speaking into the earrings; they're all
behind me. I think we're in a more populous place

1148
01:23:40,372 --> 01:23:49,469
with the undead cannibals, know what I mean?
There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.

1149
01:23:49,469 --> 01:23:53,217
TALIESIN: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample
of that bioluminescent fungus.

1150
01:23:53,217 --> 01:23:55,668
MARISHA: I can get that. I'm interested.

1151
01:23:55,668 --> 01:23:57,860
LAURA: Do you want me to fly up and get some?

1152
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,700
LIAM: We're on a schedule here.

1153
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,582
MARISHA: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go
that way.

1154
01:24:03,582 --> 01:24:07,968
LAURA: We have to go up, right? Does it look like
there's openings in the ceiling?

1155
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:12,167
MATT: Well currently you're the only one who's
stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of

1156
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,554
you are now exiting into the chamber.

1157
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:19,173
LIAM: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to
explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.

1158
01:24:19,173 --> 01:24:24,992
MATT: Okay, so they're all behind you now where
this entrance is, and as you look past it, this

1159
01:24:24,992 --> 01:24:30,981
hallway that you're entering, it looks like there
was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge

1160
01:24:30,981 --> 01:24:35,510
on the edge that held a door that had since been
broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of

1161
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:41,667
the door that once held this entranceway, and a
number of the buildings immediately to the right

1162
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:46,072
and left. That's where you stand, what do you want
to do?

1163
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:52,680
LAURA: Does it look like there's any footprints
coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?

1164
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,597
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1165
01:24:54,597 --> 01:24:57,457
TRAVIS: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?

1166
01:24:57,457 --> 01:25:02,119
LIAM: Everything we were told is that this place
is full of undead cannibals.

1167
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:04,121
LAURA: 23.

1168
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:07,091
MATT: Not in a long time.

1169
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:09,774
TRAVIS: Is there shattered remnants of the door?

1170
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:14,382
MATT: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and
there--

1171
01:25:14,382 --> 01:25:17,804
TRAVIS: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the
ground or anything?

1172
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:20,503
MATT: Make an investigation check. Lot of
investigation checks today.

1173
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:22,372
TRAVIS: Two.

1174
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:28,183
MATT: You scramble about and find a couple of
pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.

1175
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:35,716
MARISHA: Can I see any stairs carved in the side,
in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that

1176
01:25:35,716 --> 01:25:36,959
what you just checked?

1177
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:39,066
LAURA: No, that's what I was about to look for,
too.

1178
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:42,951
LIAM: Is there any movement, because there's
bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so

1179
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:48,702
there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.

1180
01:25:48,702 --> 01:25:55,371
MATT: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your
vision, because there is very little light in here

1181
01:25:55,371 --> 01:25:59,058
and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the
distance that give you a sense of the shape of

1182
01:25:59,058 --> 01:26:04,026
this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for
you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of

1183
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:06,970
your visual range, so you can't really tell.

1184
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:13,250
LIAM: A second thing I want to look for is what
other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways

1185
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,562
through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.

1186
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:17,191
MATT: Let me finish what I was saying first.

1187
01:26:17,191 --> 01:26:19,610
TRAVIS: Roll! Roll again.

1188
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:29,825
MATT: But based on the size of this chamber and
the bits of what small elements of structures that

1189
01:26:29,825 --> 01:26:35,461
you can see of the architecture within, this
definitely appears to be more of the heart of the

1190
01:26:35,461 --> 01:26:42,590
city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient
height. You can see at the very edge of your

1191
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:51,654
visual range a cracked central fountain that is
empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your

1192
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:56,903
range, the exterior of a large temple-like
building that rises out of the ability to see any

1193
01:26:56,903 --> 01:26:59,962
more of its height and structure.

1194
01:26:59,962 --> 01:27:02,257
TALIESIN: Temple.

1195
01:27:02,257 --> 01:27:06,881
MATT: But like I said, you guys are still standing
at the entrance to this cavern.

1196
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:09,819
MARISHA: What about the temple? Why?

1197
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:12,290
SAM: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?

1198
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,895
LIAM: I don't think we want to stay here--

1199
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,099
SAM: I know, that's why we just fly through.

1200
01:27:16,099 --> 01:27:18,021
LIAM: Find another exit, yeah, but where?

1201
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:21,505
TRAVIS: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.

1202
01:27:21,505 --> 01:27:23,473
SAM: What are you talking about?

1203
01:27:23,473 --> 01:27:25,671
TRAVIS: Well look, all right, my gloves--

1204
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:28,430
LAURA: Keep your voice down.

1205
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:34,891
TRAVIS: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart
of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they

1206
01:27:34,891 --> 01:27:40,158
harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a
temple, I don't know, you smart people could do

1207
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:41,506
something with that.

1208
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:46,674
LIAM: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to
come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are

1209
01:27:46,674 --> 01:27:51,805
connected to that temple, and you're going to get
what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?

1210
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:56,085
TRAVIS: Yes.

1211
01:27:56,085 --> 01:27:58,201
MARISHA: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted
yet?

1212
01:27:58,201 --> 01:28:05,401
TRAVIS: Yep. They're just buzzing.

1213
01:28:05,401 --> 01:28:07,862
LIAM: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your
fingers?

1214
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:09,300
MARISHA: Are they buzzing more?

1215
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,663
TRAVIS: Are they humming more?

1216
01:28:10,663 --> 01:28:11,844
MATT: Doesn't appear to have changed.

1217
01:28:11,844 --> 01:28:13,200
TRAVIS: Nope, just humming.

1218
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,996
MARISHA: Step two steps closer.

1219
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:17,459
TRAVIS: Two steps closer to the temple.

1220
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,462
MARISHA: Do they appear to be buzzing more?

1221
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,012
TRAVIS: Are they appearing buzzing more?

1222
01:28:22,012 --> 01:28:25,745
MATT: Make a perception check.

1223
01:28:25,745 --> 01:28:28,722
TRAVIS: Ooh! 19.

1224
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:32,035
MATT: Not bad. Nope.

1225
01:28:32,035 --> 01:28:40,857
TALIESIN: Is the temple on the way? Does it make
sense to cross through the city, or does it make

1226
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:42,259
sense to fly up?

1227
01:28:42,259 --> 01:28:50,643
LIAM: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm
negative on our chances of dealing with this

1228
01:28:50,643 --> 01:28:53,275
before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?

1229
01:28:53,275 --> 01:29:03,362
TALIESIN: We've got some time, and I feel like
this city is an opportunity to find some more

1230
01:29:03,362 --> 01:29:04,570
advantages.

1231
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:12,530
TRAVIS: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas.
What's if it's in the temple?

1232
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:16,281
SAM: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could
kill Vecna near Vecna?

1233
01:29:16,281 --> 01:29:22,502
LIAM: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but
this is a city that has existed here for a long

1234
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:27,287
time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna
doesn't own these people. This is a fucking

1235
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:32,821
mountain that existed and now they're going for a
ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?

1236
01:29:32,821 --> 01:29:35,770
TALIESIN: It's not a city that just existed.

1237
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,270
LIAM: No?

1238
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:43,668
TALIESIN: This is a giant primordial beast that
people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.

1239
01:29:43,668 --> 01:29:48,128
MARISHA: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the
other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily

1240
01:29:48,128 --> 01:29:49,353
plundered.

1241
01:29:49,353 --> 01:29:53,726
LIAM: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just
sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away.

1242
01:29:53,726 --> 01:29:56,408
These assholes don't have anything to do with--

1243
01:29:56,408 --> 01:29:58,459
TRAVIS: Why did he choose this?

1244
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:04,929
MARISHA: How far away is the temple? Do we know?
Can we football range guess it?

1245
01:30:04,929 --> 01:30:08,356
MATT: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of
60 feet?

1246
01:30:08,356 --> 01:30:16,604
TALIESIN: If gods really understood how this world
worked, this would not be happening right now.

1247
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:22,119
MATT: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where
the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.

1248
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:26,297
LIAM: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three
times wherever we were.

1249
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:30,626
LAURA: Well, he's not going to be able to do that
right now because I've got a fucking ring.

1250
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:36,360
TALIESIN: He doesn't necessarily know this place
as well as--

1251
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:43,229
MARISHA: Hang on. How long have we been in here,
versus how far have we been from Vasselheim?

1252
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,524
Because we are on a time crunch.

1253
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:54,577
TRAVIS: 200 miles away once we entered is how far
away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?

1254
01:30:54,577 --> 01:31:00,907
TALIESIN: What was the average land speed of a
laden undead?

1255
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:09,571
MATT: You've been within the titan for, I'd say,
roughly three and a half hours, maybe.

1256
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:13,663
LIAM: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at
this point.

1257
01:31:13,663 --> 01:31:15,623
TRAVIS: We have time to check the temple.

1258
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:16,953
SAM: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.

1259
01:31:16,953 --> 01:31:18,543
MARISHA: Super fucking fast!

1260
01:31:18,543 --> 01:31:21,528
TALIESIN: I'm not even saying look in it, let's
take a look at what it--

1261
01:31:21,528 --> 01:31:23,790
LAURA: Did I see any stairs?

1262
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:26,445
MATT: You do not see any staircases within a
60-foot radius of where you're standing.

1263
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:31,242
TALIESIN: We might be harder to spot if we stay on
the ground for now, anyway.

1264
01:31:31,242 --> 01:31:35,495
MARISHA: I just want to say, we gave you guys the
other temple, in which you found your stupid

1265
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:43,053
waistband, but we got really fucked up from it!
Everything has a consequence and a price and shit.

1266
01:31:43,053 --> 01:31:44,487
Nothing is free.

1267
01:31:44,487 --> 01:31:49,693
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking
Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--

1268
01:31:49,693 --> 01:31:52,094
TRAVIS: No, don't do it.

1269
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:55,875
LAURA: What if we bring out an entire fucking city
of undead dwarves upon us?

1270
01:31:55,875 --> 01:32:02,316
MARISHA: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace
and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it.

1271
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,286
Save yours.

1272
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:08,731
LIAM: I'm also going to put something on the table
here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're

1273
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:17,696
also trying to save the world. We might not be
able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.

1274
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:19,112
TALIESIN: I'm aware.

1275
01:32:19,112 --> 01:32:21,397
SAM: You want to go to sleep in this undead
city?!

1276
01:32:21,397 --> 01:32:29,176
LIAM: No, but we're trying to save the world, not
just a city.

1277
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:36,472
SAM: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel
better about a fight?

1278
01:32:36,472 --> 01:32:43,048
LIAM: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who
fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is

1279
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:47,434
gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if
we fuck this up!

1280
01:32:47,434 --> 01:32:52,869
SAM: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long
it takes.

1281
01:32:52,869 --> 01:33:02,056
MARISHA: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still
don't know how to get up there, right?

1282
01:33:02,056 --> 01:33:03,777
SAM: Is that purple eyeliner?

1283
01:33:03,777 --> 01:33:11,599
MARISHA: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a
little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I

1284
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:12,606
was waiting for--

1285
01:33:12,606 --> 01:33:14,267
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh my god!

1286
01:33:14,267 --> 01:33:22,510
MARISHA: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but
what if we split the party? What if a few of you

1287
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:28,127
check out your fucking temple, and then the rest
of us try to figure out a way to get up.

1288
01:33:28,127 --> 01:33:30,794
TRAVIS: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.

1289
01:33:30,794 --> 01:33:34,771
MARISHA: Temple party. Who else is on temple
party?

1290
01:33:34,771 --> 01:33:37,207
SAM: They need somebody who can help them in
there.

1291
01:33:37,207 --> 01:33:39,809
LIAM: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest
motherfucker in this room.

1292
01:33:39,809 --> 01:33:43,040
TALIESIN: And then you three on the carpet, you on
the broom.

1293
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,521
TRAVIS: I need the carpet.

1294
01:33:44,521 --> 01:33:47,482
MARISHA: So wait, just the two of you are going to
go check out the carpet?

1295
01:33:47,482 --> 01:33:52,173
LAURA: Vax is going in with you.

1296
01:33:52,173 --> 01:33:56,927
SAM: I feel like one person with magic should go
with them. I'll go with them.

1297
01:33:56,927 --> 01:33:59,930
TALIESIN: We're all ear-pieced.

1298
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:02,588
MARISHA: Okay, so Grog--

1299
01:34:02,588 --> 01:34:04,578
LIAM: Everybody but Keyleth.

1300
01:34:04,578 --> 01:34:11,953
SAM: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going
searching. The boys are going in the temple, and

1301
01:34:11,953 --> 01:34:13,782
the girls are going searching.

1302
01:34:13,782 --> 01:34:15,686
MARISHA: Okay, cool, I'm on board.

1303
01:34:15,686 --> 01:34:19,825
TALIESIN: This is in no way, by the way, an
amazing mirror of that one time underneath

1304
01:34:19,825 --> 01:34:23,882
Kraghammer. They're just going to find another
Clarota.

1305
01:34:23,933 --> 01:34:27,246
LIAM: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.

1306
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:31,661
LAURA: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't
die in this stupid temple.

1307
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:33,595
TALIESIN: I will not die in this stupid temple.

1308
01:34:33,595 --> 01:34:35,538
SAM: I'm going, too.

1309
01:34:35,538 --> 01:34:38,928
TALIESIN: I slap him in the face.

1310
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:41,669
LAURA: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.

1311
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:47,236
MATT: Who's traveling in what group?

1312
01:34:47,236 --> 01:34:50,985
LAURA: Girls are going to look for stairs, the
boys are going in the stupid temple.

1313
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:53,422
LIAM: I yank the druid in for a kiss.

1314
01:34:53,422 --> 01:34:54,742
MATT: Okay.

1315
01:34:54,742 --> 01:34:59,006
SAM: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.

1316
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:03,641
LAURA: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the
party.

1317
01:35:03,641 --> 01:35:08,387
TALIESIN: Okay, can't split the party. We all go
looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it!

1318
01:35:08,387 --> 01:35:11,476
(laughter)

1319
01:35:11,476 --> 01:35:16,846
LAURA: He was really excited about it!

1320
01:35:16,846 --> 01:35:18,423
MATT: I was waiting on that.

1321
01:35:18,423 --> 01:35:20,722
LAURA: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.

1322
01:35:20,722 --> 01:35:25,223
SAM: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's
just fucking go to the fucking temple.

1323
01:35:25,223 --> 01:35:30,394
MATT: I was like, you guys literally had this
conversation an hour ago, but okay.

1324
01:35:30,394 --> 01:35:34,645
TALIESIN: Whatever we do, we can't split the party
(fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.

1325
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:36,729
TRAVIS: Sam saved our asses.

1326
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:38,365
TALIESIN: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.

1327
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:44,810
LIAM: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the
group, hating himself. Here we go.

1328
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:47,519
MATT: Go for it. What are you doing, you're
checking for traps?

1329
01:35:47,519 --> 01:35:52,646
LIAM: I'm checking for enemies hiding.

1330
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:54,466
MATT: So as you push forward--

1331
01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:56,446
LAURA: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a
Traced.

1332
01:35:56,446 --> 01:35:57,850
MATT: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.

1333
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,142
LAURA: She Pass Without a Traced us.

1334
01:35:59,142 --> 01:36:01,824
MATT: Right, then roll some stealth.

1335
01:36:01,824 --> 01:36:04,020
SAM: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?

1336
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,219
LIAM: 34.

1337
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:08,408
SAM: 25.

1338
01:36:08,408 --> 01:36:09,277
TALIESIN: 26.

1339
01:36:09,277 --> 01:36:11,429
MARISHA: 26.

1340
01:36:11,429 --> 01:36:13,214
LAURA: 39.

1341
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:14,727
TRAVIS: Natural one.

1342
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,153
MARISHA: Are you serious?

1343
01:36:16,153 --> 01:36:17,385
SAM: He's so excited about that temple.

1344
01:36:17,385 --> 01:36:20,870
LAURA: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets
disadvantage.

1345
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:23,911
MATT: She has the boots that make it not at
disadvantage.

1346
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:25,509
TALIESIN: First time ever.

1347
01:36:25,509 --> 01:36:27,176
LIAM: But that's a lot of good.

1348
01:36:27,176 --> 01:36:30,312
LAURA: So much good for one shitty--

1349
01:36:30,312 --> 01:36:38,540
MATT: You begin to push forward past the cracked
fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an

1350
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:42,963
eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of
the temple-like structure begin to reveal

1351
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:48,635
themselves, standing ominous over the
debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and

1352
01:36:48,635 --> 01:36:55,517
bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking
beneath every footfall of the walking mountain

1353
01:36:55,517 --> 01:37:01,190
that you currently are walking through. You see
long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond

1354
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:07,212
reanimation lying scattered across the broken
street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking

1355
01:37:07,212 --> 01:37:12,580
the splintered bone. A tangled network of
partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal

1356
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:17,638
themselves above you, carved from the mountain,
contains a ghostly image of a multi-level

1357
01:37:17,638 --> 01:37:27,651
metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception
check.

1358
01:37:27,651 --> 01:37:29,056
LIAM: 29.

1359
01:37:29,056 --> 01:37:35,022
MATT: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where
the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of

1360
01:37:35,022 --> 01:37:41,494
you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving
throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling

1361
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:46,152
structures. You can see now, many of the undead
citizens of the catacombs are now wandering,

1362
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:53,607
shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now
carries them within. You also see a very faint

1363
01:37:53,607 --> 01:38:01,817
blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the
windows of the temple.

1364
01:38:01,817 --> 01:38:11,909
LIAM: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he
doesn't kick something or be himself?

1365
01:38:11,909 --> 01:38:16,019
LAURA: We don't know that he rolled shittily.

1366
01:38:16,019 --> 01:38:21,439
LIAM: I know that, but he's a big, blundering
mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--

1367
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:24,215
TRAVIS: On the chain. Literally on the text
chain.

1368
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:30,829
MATT: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a
(clattering), and you glance over real fast and

1369
01:38:30,829 --> 01:38:35,775
watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his--
which weapon do you have attuned right now? You

1370
01:38:35,775 --> 01:38:43,701
have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of
a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a

1371
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:51,485
corner angle and is currently being held by a
small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts

1372
01:38:51,485 --> 01:38:59,414
(crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a
second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts

1373
01:38:59,414 --> 01:39:05,991
of it chip and break, but most of it remains
strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you

1374
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:15,110
see at the edge of your visual range, about seven
of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and

1375
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:18,681
begin slowly slinking their way in the direction
of the noise.

1376
01:39:18,681 --> 01:39:20,737
SAM: So a rock just fell?

1377
01:39:20,737 --> 01:39:22,368
TRAVIS: A big statue just fell.

1378
01:39:22,368 --> 01:39:24,106
SAM: And is in pieces?

1379
01:39:24,106 --> 01:39:25,856
MATT: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty
sturdy.

1380
01:39:25,856 --> 01:39:29,866
TALIESIN: Let's try and serpentine around and see
if we can trace back.

1381
01:39:29,866 --> 01:39:31,367
LIAM: And they're to the right or the left or
ahead of us?

1382
01:39:31,367 --> 01:39:33,689
MATT: They're ahead of you.

1383
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:35,397
LAURA: Do they look like they saw us?

1384
01:39:35,397 --> 01:39:45,541
LIAM: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put
Grog on the carpet now?

1385
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,853
TALIESIN: Yep.

1386
01:39:46,853 --> 01:39:48,774
MARISHA: We're trying to go up, right?

1387
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,219
SAM: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.

1388
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:53,530
LAURA: Towards that pulsing light.

1389
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:58,450
LIAM: We've got a little bit of business, a little
bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve

1390
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:00,406
to the left.

1391
01:40:00,406 --> 01:40:02,409
TRAVIS: All right, we move accordingly.

1392
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:12,443
MATT: All right. So you guys move along the left
and curve around the side. As you begin to move

1393
01:40:12,443 --> 01:40:21,174
along the edge, you watch as about eight of these
mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble

1394
01:40:21,174 --> 01:40:27,089
in the direction of where the noise came from. You
can see elements of their long-mummified skin

1395
01:40:27,089 --> 01:40:32,303
pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and
the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken

1396
01:40:32,303 --> 01:40:40,572
against whatever things it's attempted to chew on
its long un-life. As they move past, two of them

1397
01:40:40,572 --> 01:40:49,302
glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all
of them shift over in the direction and begin

1398
01:40:49,302 --> 01:40:51,450
rushing forward in your path.

1399
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:53,093
LIAM: What's the distance?

1400
01:40:53,093 --> 01:40:55,648
MATT: At this point, they're probably about 50 or
so feet from where you are.

1401
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:57,735
LIAM: Oh shit!

1402
01:40:57,735 --> 01:41:02,610
LAURA: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm
going to shoot a couple.

1403
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:05,640
TRAVIS: We could just go straight up.

1404
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,972
LAURA: There's only eight of them. We can take
eight undead.

1405
01:41:07,972 --> 01:41:11,724
LIAM: Pickle walks forward and takes a
knee and waits with her holy symbol

1406
01:41:11,724 --> 01:41:13,863
of Sarenrae, waiting for them.

1407
01:41:13,863 --> 01:41:19,541
LAURA: I take two of them by surprise. That's
auto-crit.

1408
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:24,896
LIAM: Vax does the same, watching his badass
sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.

1409
01:41:25,084 --> 01:41:27,984
LAURA: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.

1410
01:41:27,984 --> 01:41:29,639
LIAM: So what happens first?

1411
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:31,617
MATT: All right. She's preparing for it, right?

1412
01:41:31,617 --> 01:41:34,042
LIAM: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.

1413
01:41:34,042 --> 01:41:37,794
MATT: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60
feet.

1414
01:41:37,794 --> 01:41:40,973
LIAM: So she's waiting until they're within range
of her holy abilities.

1415
01:41:40,973 --> 01:41:42,436
MATT: What's the radius on that one?

1416
01:41:42,436 --> 01:41:47,965
LIAM: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue
paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.

1417
01:41:47,965 --> 01:41:49,377
MATT: That's all right.

1418
01:41:49,377 --> 01:41:51,294
LIAM: What if I look in the sorceror rules?

1419
01:41:51,294 --> 01:41:54,185
MATT: Nope. 30 feet.

1420
01:41:54,185 --> 01:42:00,120
LIAM: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to
do their work and anything that's left over she's

1421
01:42:00,163 --> 01:42:01,482
going to scatter.

1422
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:05,788
MATT: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--

1423
01:42:05,788 --> 01:42:08,804
LAURA: So it's auto-crit?

1424
01:42:08,804 --> 01:42:15,258
MATT: They know you're there. It's not a surprise.
There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do

1425
01:42:15,258 --> 01:42:18,921
have advantage on the hits because they don't see
you.

1426
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:20,825
LAURA: Well great, that's great. 20?

1427
01:42:20,825 --> 01:42:22,413
MATT: That definitely hits.

1428
01:42:22,413 --> 01:42:30,120
LAURA: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits.
It's a 19 plus 14.

1429
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,404
LIAM: 25, 31, natural 20.

1430
01:42:32,404 --> 01:42:39,364
MATT: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage
on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons

1431
01:42:39,364 --> 01:42:41,074
or one each?

1432
01:42:41,074 --> 01:42:43,729
LIAM: I'm after my sister. She talked before I
did.

1433
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:45,910
LAURA: I'll see how the first arrow hits?

1434
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,467
MATT: Okay.

1435
01:42:48,467 --> 01:42:57,588
LAURA: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever.
14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add

1436
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:00,953
anything? Sneak attack!

1437
01:43:00,953 --> 01:43:02,540
TALIESIN: Been a while.

1438
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:05,214
LAURA: How do we D&amp;D? Plus ten sneak attack.

1439
01:43:05,258 --> 01:43:10,499
MATT: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits
it and the torso explodes behind with ribs

1440
01:43:10,499 --> 01:43:15,085
shattering and scattering across the stonework,
its body falling and collapsing to the ground.

1441
01:43:15,085 --> 01:43:16,244
LAURA: I hit another one.

1442
01:43:16,244 --> 01:43:17,886
MATT: Yes, you do.

1443
01:43:17,886 --> 01:43:21,328
LIAM: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.

1444
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:30,622
LAURA: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is
plus eight.

1445
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:32,376
TRAVIS: 26.

1446
01:43:32,376 --> 01:43:38,435
MATT: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw
unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick

1447
01:43:38,435 --> 01:43:44,517
rotting material that dangles through the hole in
the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner,

1448
01:43:44,517 --> 01:43:49,365
and you watch as part of its head explodes off one
side from the secondary arrow, taking out what

1449
01:43:49,365 --> 01:43:55,200
remains of the center of its skull, and the body
crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.

1450
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,880
LIAM: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect,
right?

1451
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,430
MATT: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that
one.

1452
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:03,134
LAURA: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second
arrow.

1453
01:44:03,134 --> 01:44:05,276
MATT: Well, you can do sneak attack once per
round.

1454
01:44:05,341 --> 01:44:07,701
LAURA: Okay. I did eight damage too much.

1455
01:44:07,701 --> 01:44:08,884
MATT: It was still enough.

1456
01:44:08,884 --> 01:44:10,621
LAURA: Okay.

1457
01:44:10,621 --> 01:44:12,611
MATT: You don't have to roll damage for sneak
attack.

1458
01:44:12,611 --> 01:44:14,663
LIAM: So then that one's gone?

1459
01:44:14,663 --> 01:44:18,856
MATT: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it
with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column,

1460
01:44:18,856 --> 01:44:20,364
and it folds on itself.

1461
01:44:20,364 --> 01:44:25,072
LIAM: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus
action. So that's the first of three. The last

1462
01:44:25,072 --> 01:44:33,419
one's the one that was a critical hit so the
second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's

1463
01:44:33,419 --> 01:44:35,823
just an eight.

1464
01:44:35,823 --> 01:44:39,281
MATT: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the
side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward

1465
01:44:39,281 --> 01:44:40,664
towards Grog.

1466
01:44:40,664 --> 01:44:45,291
LIAM: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which
is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two

1467
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:59,226
plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that
much. It's 15 total.

1468
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:02,242
MATT: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's
three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to

1469
01:45:02,242 --> 01:45:08,796
individually roll an initiative check for me.

1470
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:11,683
TRAVIS: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.

1471
01:45:11,683 --> 01:45:16,493
MATT: So as you guys are watching this happen, the
other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at

1472
01:45:16,493 --> 01:45:19,078
the ready, and you get to strike before they do.

1473
01:45:19,078 --> 01:45:31,559
TRAVIS: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay.
Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.

1474
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:32,827
MATT: That hits.

1475
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:33,902
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

1476
01:45:33,902 --> 01:45:39,858
MATT: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as
the first one comes up towards you, you swing up.

1477
01:45:39,858 --> 01:45:45,059
As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body
blows up against the side of the nearby stone

1478
01:45:45,059 --> 01:45:47,554
building and then scrapes to the ground.

1479
01:45:47,554 --> 01:45:51,570
TRAVIS: Can I use the other strike on another?

1480
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:52,882
MATT: Yes, you can.

1481
01:45:52,882 --> 01:45:56,092
TRAVIS: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's
like 30.

1482
01:45:56,092 --> 01:46:01,158
TALIESIN: If there's anything left on Grog by the
end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.

1483
01:46:01,158 --> 01:46:02,502
TRAVIS: 32.

1484
01:46:02,502 --> 01:46:08,171
MATT: All righty. So two more detonate on this
point. So there's three left. They're closing in

1485
01:46:08,171 --> 01:46:10,078
on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?

1486
01:46:10,078 --> 01:46:12,583
TRAVIS: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.

1487
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:14,465
LAURA: No, I think we should save.

1488
01:46:14,465 --> 01:46:19,854
LIAM: I've already said it, but she's whispering
to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now.

1489
01:46:19,854 --> 01:46:21,445
You're half of Pike right now.

1490
01:46:21,445 --> 01:46:26,186
TALIESIN: I'd like to pop in and see if I could
take a couple--

1491
01:46:26,186 --> 01:46:27,711
MATT: Make an initiative roll.

1492
01:46:27,711 --> 01:46:29,162
LAURA: Don't shoot, Percy.

1493
01:46:29,162 --> 01:46:31,132
TALIESIN: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.

1494
01:46:31,132 --> 01:46:33,416
LIAM: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them
coming on.

1495
01:46:33,416 --> 01:46:34,618
TALIESIN: 16.

1496
01:46:34,618 --> 01:46:39,036
MATT: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as
the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--

1497
01:46:39,036 --> 01:46:43,153
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered
sword, and take some swipes.

1498
01:46:43,153 --> 01:46:44,448
MATT: Go for it.

1499
01:46:44,448 --> 01:46:46,529
TALIESIN: Let's take three swipes right out of
here.

1500
01:46:46,529 --> 01:46:50,136
LAURA: Pike can use her mace on anything left in
that area.

1501
01:46:50,136 --> 01:46:55,792
TALIESIN: That's one natural 20, one natural 19.
Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?

1502
01:46:55,792 --> 01:46:57,048
MATT: No.

1503
01:46:57,048 --> 01:47:00,521
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that
might be enough, because I have a really high--

1504
01:47:00,521 --> 01:47:05,327
that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?

1505
01:47:05,327 --> 01:47:06,678
MATT: 15 does hit. Yes.

1506
01:47:06,678 --> 01:47:16,731
TALIESIN: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage
to the first one with a silvered sword.

1507
01:47:16,731 --> 01:47:21,285
MATT: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the
first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in

1508
01:47:21,285 --> 01:47:22,618
front of you.

1509
01:47:22,618 --> 01:47:28,417
TALIESIN: Number two is 13 points of damage to the
second one.

1510
01:47:28,417 --> 01:47:35,821
MATT: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade
down into the skull and cleave it in half. You

1511
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:39,045
watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side
and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest

1512
01:47:39,045 --> 01:47:40,475
crumbles in place.

1513
01:47:40,475 --> 01:47:49,329
TALIESIN: I twirl around and take my third
wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of

1514
01:47:49,329 --> 01:47:50,485
damage.

1515
01:47:50,485 --> 01:47:56,116
MATT: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward,
in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect

1516
01:47:56,116 --> 01:48:00,873
for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate
towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade

1517
01:48:00,873 --> 01:48:05,443
and take the head right off at the neck, and it
falls and crumples to the ground.

1518
01:48:05,443 --> 01:48:08,980
MARISHA: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?

1519
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:12,261
TRAVIS: 28 Days Later, they run.

1520
01:48:12,261 --> 01:48:15,115
MARISHA: He said that they were fast.

1521
01:48:15,115 --> 01:48:18,503
MATT: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.

1522
01:48:18,516 --> 01:48:22,484
MARISHA: Just wanted to make sure they weren't
special.

1523
01:48:22,484 --> 01:48:33,679
MATT: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold
yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or

1524
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:36,433
notice any more advancing undead from that
direction.

1525
01:48:36,433 --> 01:48:43,439
TRAVIS: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody
with flying ability go to check out that blue

1526
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:44,467
glowy window?

1527
01:48:44,467 --> 01:48:46,204
TALIESIN: We have to stick together.

1528
01:48:46,204 --> 01:48:48,724
LAURA: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?

1529
01:48:48,724 --> 01:48:50,507
TALIESIN: No, it's far.

1530
01:48:50,507 --> 01:48:53,460
TRAVIS: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to
60 feet away.

1531
01:48:53,460 --> 01:49:00,645
MATT: The temple where you guys were at, at the
time was 50 feet away from you, but you would

1532
01:49:00,645 --> 01:49:07,244
have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's
about 100 feet away from you. At this distance,

1533
01:49:07,308 --> 01:49:17,296
you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical
building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small

1534
01:49:17,367 --> 01:49:25,944
square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's
big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow

1535
01:49:25,944 --> 01:49:28,333
between multiple windows from this distance.

1536
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:30,440
TRAVIS: So should we fly up to that window?

1537
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:35,904
TALIESIN: I think it'd be safer to stay on the
ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air,

1538
01:49:35,904 --> 01:49:37,256
they are going to see us.

1539
01:49:37,256 --> 01:49:38,954
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1540
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:41,026
MARISHA: And we still have Pass Without a Trace,
so let's go.

1541
01:49:41,026 --> 01:49:42,859
LAURA: Yes, we do. She cast it.

1542
01:49:42,859 --> 01:49:50,080
MATT: All right, now that this brief combat has
finished, those who took place in it, which would

1543
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:54,918
be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your
stealth checks.

1544
01:49:54,918 --> 01:49:57,986
LAURA: You're like, "Gladly!"

1545
01:49:57,986 --> 01:49:59,294
TALIESIN: Yes.

1546
01:49:59,294 --> 01:50:08,952
LAURA: What about Pike? Because she just knelt
down. She didn't really fight.

1547
01:50:08,952 --> 01:50:12,653
MATT: She stepped out of her stealth. She was
making herself visible.

1548
01:50:12,653 --> 01:50:15,785
LAURA: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!

1549
01:50:15,785 --> 01:50:17,126
TALIESIN: 23.

1550
01:50:17,126 --> 01:50:18,847
LIAM: We still have Pass Without Trace?

1551
01:50:18,847 --> 01:50:21,062
MARISHA: Yes. I didn't do anything.

1552
01:50:21,062 --> 01:50:22,065
TRAVIS: 26.

1553
01:50:22,065 --> 01:50:23,815
MARISHA: Keeping that concentration.

1554
01:50:23,815 --> 01:50:27,602
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: (singing) Concentration.
Concentration.

1555
01:50:27,602 --> 01:50:29,689
LIAM: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the
run!

1556
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:33,693
LAURA: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.

1557
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:40,620
MATT: All right. You guys begin to slowly make
your way along the left wall of this large

1558
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:41,833
cavern.

1559
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:43,178
LIAM: 37, by the way.

1560
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:49,916
MATT: Good to know. As you slowly move through the
shadows, dodging through open doorways and through

1561
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:56,216
windows, trying the best you can to stay out from
the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see

1562
01:50:56,216 --> 01:51:05,970
more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even
a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter

1563
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:11,690
of your visual range and you can see in the
catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the

1564
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:19,413
orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across
the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.

1565
01:51:19,413 --> 01:51:22,159
LAURA: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?

1566
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:24,445
SAM: Oh, the filter? The censer?

1567
01:51:24,445 --> 01:51:26,540
LAURA: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?

1568
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:28,075
TALIESIN: We also have the herbs.

1569
01:51:28,075 --> 01:51:31,878
LAURA: What if we use it? What if we use it and it
just repels them?

1570
01:51:31,878 --> 01:51:41,060
TALIESIN: When it's time. We don't have a lot of
it.

1571
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:43,926
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a very small amount.

1572
01:51:43,926 --> 01:51:46,024
LIAM: Is it ready to go, though?

1573
01:51:46,024 --> 01:51:48,510
TALIESIN: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--

1574
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:50,029
LIAM: Is it ready to go, though?

1575
01:51:50,029 --> 01:51:55,462
MARISHA: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I
spent time during the break.

1576
01:51:55,462 --> 01:52:02,786
TALIESIN: It's just burning the herbs, though. We
don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.

1577
01:52:02,786 --> 01:52:08,411
LIAM: Do we have any sense of where we started in
this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking

1578
01:52:08,411 --> 01:52:09,691
turned around?

1579
01:52:09,691 --> 01:52:18,156
MATT: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are
maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began.

1580
01:52:18,156 --> 01:52:22,218
Because you've been moving slowly. Staying
stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very

1581
01:52:22,218 --> 01:52:28,970
slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and
where you are currently, you're about halfway

1582
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:32,414
through it, or close to halfway.

1583
01:52:32,414 --> 01:52:38,329
TALIESIN: It's good that we didn't go on the
catwalk.

1584
01:52:38,329 --> 01:52:43,850
MATT: The temple's on the opposite side of the
chamber.

1585
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:47,728
LIAM: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought
it was central.

1586
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:52,730
MATT: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance,
the temple was to the front and to the right of

1587
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:58,052
you. You guys curved around the left, on the other
side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see

1588
01:52:58,052 --> 01:53:02,080
it from across the way. Are you making your way
across to the temple?

1589
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,643
LIAM: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of
this big place?

1590
01:53:05,643 --> 01:53:08,687
SAM: Are the undead all around the temple?

1591
01:53:08,687 --> 01:53:14,888
MATT: Further in. Nothing directly around the
outside of the temple. So you guys curve around

1592
01:53:14,888 --> 01:53:20,166
the entrance where you came and slowly make your
way towards where the temple emerges from the rock

1593
01:53:20,166 --> 01:53:27,190
wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is
actually built into the side of this cavern, and

1594
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:35,990
the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple
structure curves outward. You can see as you get

1595
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:41,384
closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it
but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and

1596
01:53:41,384 --> 01:53:45,676
you can see areas where it looks like it's
sustained some physical damage or eroded over

1597
01:53:45,676 --> 01:53:53,532
time. You eventually make your way around the
outside wall of the temple to one of the first

1598
01:53:53,532 --> 01:54:01,002
doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet
tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This

1599
01:54:01,002 --> 01:54:02,663
is an old temple.

1600
01:54:02,663 --> 01:54:09,043
LIAM: Is that light you talked about coming from
one specific source, or all over the place? Every

1601
01:54:09,043 --> 01:54:10,343
window.

1602
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:11,961
TRAVIS: Is there a story?

1603
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:13,682
MATT: It looks to be coming from the base.

1604
01:54:13,682 --> 01:54:15,336
LIAM: From down below.

1605
01:54:15,336 --> 01:54:17,108
LAURA: Can we see in one of the windows?

1606
01:54:17,108 --> 01:54:19,750
MATT: You can look inside. Make a perception check.

1607
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:23,629
SAM: Are there any bone laying around?

1608
01:54:23,629 --> 01:54:24,673
MATT: Plenty.

1609
01:54:24,673 --> 01:54:32,412
SAM: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to
Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street,

1610
01:54:32,412 --> 01:54:37,840
50 feet away from us, and wait there in some
building. Hold these bones.

1611
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:45,471
MATT: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide
over, then stand there.

1612
01:54:45,471 --> 01:54:47,471
LAURA: 34.

1613
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:51,810
MATT: Okay. As you pull up to the window and
glance down, you immediately look inside the

1614
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:59,579
temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of
shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the

1615
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:05,490
base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes
and shapes because they are all faintly outlined

1616
01:55:05,490 --> 01:55:13,314
from the source of this blue light. You see a
small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is

1617
01:55:13,314 --> 01:55:18,651
resting, not in the perfect center of the temple
but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and

1618
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:22,514
it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and
standing.

1619
01:55:22,514 --> 01:55:26,518
SAM: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get
that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.

1620
01:55:26,518 --> 01:55:29,451
TALIESIN: Also, have your unseen servant make a
bunch of noise and have them all--

1621
01:55:29,451 --> 01:55:31,053
MARISHA: Be a distraction?

1622
01:55:31,053 --> 01:55:34,961
LAURA: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would
draw large crowds.

1623
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:38,663
TALIESIN: We can have the unseen servant pick it
up.

1624
01:55:38,663 --> 01:55:39,847
MARISHA: How far away can he be, though?

1625
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:41,911
SAM: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's
waiting to make noise.

1626
01:55:41,911 --> 01:55:44,467
TALIESIN: What if he were to go in and get it
himself?

1627
01:55:44,467 --> 01:55:45,837
SAM: He could.

1628
01:55:45,837 --> 01:55:47,155
TRAVIS: He is invisible, isn't he?

1629
01:55:47,155 --> 01:55:49,519
SAM: He could go and pick it up and come right
back with it.

1630
01:55:49,519 --> 01:55:54,218
LAURA: But first don't tell him to come right out,
tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they

1631
01:55:54,218 --> 01:55:55,498
follow the light.

1632
01:55:55,498 --> 01:55:58,351
LIAM: But what are our options if that doesn't
work?

1633
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:03,425
SAM: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work,
or it doesn't move?

1634
01:56:03,425 --> 01:56:12,016
LIAM: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I
can click the boots, and I can be there in a

1635
01:56:12,016 --> 01:56:15,497
heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?

1636
01:56:15,497 --> 01:56:20,430
SAM: We need an escape plan, right? How many can
fit on the carpet?

1637
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:27,070
LIAM: This goes back to my conversation with you,
which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?

1638
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:29,586
TALIESIN: Yes, but not here.

1639
01:56:29,586 --> 01:56:39,395
LIAM: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim,
and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to

1640
01:56:39,395 --> 01:56:43,173
be ready to do what's necessary?

1641
01:56:43,173 --> 01:56:49,829
TRAVIS: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his
miracle, his display of power, and he will be even

1642
01:56:49,829 --> 01:56:52,526
stronger. That is not an option.

1643
01:56:52,526 --> 01:56:58,727
TALIESIN: If we were to be clever, if we're at the
edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be

1644
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:04,909
distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal
with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.

1645
01:57:04,909 --> 01:57:13,458
LIAM: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not
talking about a short rest.

1646
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:15,126
TALIESIN: There will not be a long rest, I don't
think.

1647
01:57:15,126 --> 01:57:16,377
LAURA: There might be.

1648
01:57:16,377 --> 01:57:19,286
LIAM: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.

1649
01:57:19,286 --> 01:57:23,749
MARISHA: I've been very conservative with what
I've been doing for a reason.

1650
01:57:23,749 --> 01:57:25,717
TRAVIS: I don't think a long rest is in the
cards.

1651
01:57:25,717 --> 01:57:28,520
TALIESIN: I've only burned one thing that requires
a long rest.

1652
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:36,504
MARISHA: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice
having him gain all of those followers, because

1653
01:57:36,504 --> 01:57:42,319
then the only option would be murder a lot of his
followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.

1654
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,529
TRAVIS: And he may be too strong at that point.

1655
01:57:45,529 --> 01:57:49,883
SAM: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to
get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!

1656
01:57:49,883 --> 01:57:53,844
TALIESIN: If we can pull this off without burning
anything important, then it doesn't matter.

1657
01:57:53,844 --> 01:57:57,423
MARISHA: I want to go on record and say I think
this is stupid. Okay, let's go.

1658
01:57:57,423 --> 01:58:00,031
LAURA: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I
want it.

1659
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,589
TRAVIS: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get
on the carpet.

1660
01:58:02,589 --> 01:58:07,504
LAURA: It looks really super magical.

1661
01:58:07,504 --> 01:58:09,488
TRAVIS: Who's on the broom with Vex?

1662
01:58:09,488 --> 01:58:10,535
LAURA: Me.

1663
01:58:10,535 --> 01:58:12,544
TRAVIS: No, who is on the broom with you?

1664
01:58:12,544 --> 01:58:15,415
TALIESIN: I'll be on the broom with her.

1665
01:58:15,415 --> 01:58:19,191
TRAVIS: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?

1666
01:58:19,191 --> 01:58:20,489
SAM: Yeah, of course.

1667
01:58:20,489 --> 01:58:23,376
MARISHA: I have to come with you because I have
the Pass Without a Trace spell.

1668
01:58:23,376 --> 01:58:25,945
TALIESIN: We all have to be together. We can't
separate.

1669
01:58:25,945 --> 01:58:27,315
TRAVIS: And he can fly.

1670
01:58:27,315 --> 01:58:29,281
SAM: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.

1671
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:31,090
LIAM: Yeah, that's right.

1672
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:33,897
SAM: We have too many people for the carpet and
the broom.

1673
01:58:33,897 --> 01:58:38,091
LIAM: My wings are gone. There's no wings for
Vecna unless we rest.

1674
01:58:38,091 --> 01:58:40,733
TRAVIS: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace,
and I'll get in there.

1675
01:58:40,733 --> 01:58:43,127
TALIESIN: I can also climb up the wall, if need
be.

1676
01:58:43,127 --> 01:58:44,936
SAM: We can leave Trinket.

1677
01:58:44,936 --> 01:58:52,119
LIAM: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the
wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.

1678
01:58:52,119 --> 01:58:54,763
TRAVIS: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do
that?

1679
01:58:54,763 --> 01:58:58,038
SAM: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or
something.

1680
01:58:58,038 --> 01:59:02,375
TALIESIN: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to
take one last look around to see if there's any

1681
01:59:02,375 --> 01:59:06,968
infrastructure for getting up. There must be
infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't

1682
01:59:06,968 --> 01:59:10,608
layers of a city on top of each other.

1683
01:59:10,608 --> 01:59:12,521
SAM: We could just run.

1684
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:15,065
LIAM: But wait, where are we going though if we
get this thing?

1685
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:16,237
SAM: Up away.

1686
01:59:16,237 --> 01:59:21,004
LIAM: We have no verification of an exit or a hole
or anything!

1687
01:59:21,004 --> 01:59:23,163
TRAVIS: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap,
okay?

1688
01:59:23,163 --> 01:59:28,040
LIAM: That's my entire life, but this is the last
moment.

1689
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:37,088
SAM: Every organ in a body has an entrance and
an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just

1690
01:59:37,088 --> 01:59:38,563
have the one.

1691
01:59:38,563 --> 01:59:48,417
MARISHA: Wait up, we argued more this game more
than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to

1692
01:59:48,417 --> 01:59:52,658
fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue
crystally thing right?

1693
01:59:52,658 --> 01:59:54,460
LAURA: No, the blue crystal is right here.

1694
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,727
MARISHA: Well, then what the fuck?

1695
01:59:56,727 --> 01:59:58,230
LAURA: I don't know!

1696
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:02,071
LIAM: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just
not how to get the fuck out.

1697
02:00:02,071 --> 02:00:04,091
MARISHA: We fucking fly!

1698
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:07,036
TRAVIS: Who burns a spell to become an animal?

1699
02:00:07,036 --> 02:00:08,281
MARISHA: I can burn a spell.

1700
02:00:08,281 --> 02:00:09,541
TRAVIS: You do that.

1701
02:00:09,541 --> 02:00:11,785
MARISHA: We're probably going to take another
short rest, right?

1702
02:00:11,785 --> 02:00:12,898
TRAVIS: Probably.

1703
02:00:12,898 --> 02:00:14,043
MARISHA: Okay.

1704
02:00:14,043 --> 02:00:20,298
SAM: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across
the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of

1705
02:00:20,298 --> 02:00:23,529
people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and
then we hustle out of there.

1706
02:00:23,529 --> 02:00:26,257
TRAVIS: What if only half the room leaves,
though?

1707
02:00:26,257 --> 02:00:28,693
LAURA: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the
crystal.

1708
02:00:28,693 --> 02:00:31,759
SAM: And there's going to be a floating crystal
that marches across?

1709
02:00:31,759 --> 02:00:38,683
TRAVIS: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the
carpet. We're ready to go.

1710
02:00:38,683 --> 02:00:44,268
MARISHA: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and
you're on broom?

1711
02:00:44,268 --> 02:00:46,691
TRAVIS: Percy and Vex are on the broom.

1712
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:52,805
MATT: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and
Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what

1713
02:00:52,805 --> 02:00:54,060
creature?

1714
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,529
MARISHA: Giant eagle.

1715
02:00:55,529 --> 02:00:56,456
MATT: Giant eagle.

1716
02:00:56,456 --> 02:00:57,888
MARISHA: Not yet, though.

1717
02:00:57,888 --> 02:01:03,465
LAURA: And then we all, within 60 feet of each
other, fly up.

1718
02:01:03,465 --> 02:01:04,704
MARISHA: Okay.

1719
02:01:04,704 --> 02:01:07,733
MATT: Okay, who's doing what?

1720
02:01:07,733 --> 02:01:09,361
LAURA: Simon 2.

1721
02:01:09,361 --> 02:01:15,255
SAM: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's
say they all start watching the thing come towards

1722
02:01:15,255 --> 02:01:18,185
us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?

1723
02:01:18,185 --> 02:01:19,645
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have to be.

1724
02:01:19,645 --> 02:01:21,691
SAM: Can you throw something across the room to
make a noise?

1725
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:23,599
TRAVIS: Yep. I can absolutely do that.

1726
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,184
LAURA: I'll prime an arrow.

1727
02:01:26,184 --> 02:01:33,201
TRAVIS: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in
it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been

1728
02:01:33,201 --> 02:01:35,271
sitting in there for four years.

1729
02:01:35,271 --> 02:01:36,881
SAM: This is a terrible plan.

1730
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:40,575
TALIESIN: This is why we hoarded it in the first
place.

1731
02:01:40,575 --> 02:01:48,224
SAM: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time
before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2.

1732
02:01:48,224 --> 02:01:53,525
Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could
(snatching noise).

1733
02:01:53,525 --> 02:01:56,168
LIAM: Scanlan, only with the boots.

1734
02:01:56,168 --> 02:02:02,504
TRAVIS: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel,
and we'll leave.

1735
02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:06,480
TALIESIN: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it
and run, anyway.

1736
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:10,751
SAM: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your
bones!

1737
02:02:10,751 --> 02:02:14,259
MATT: The bones shift over towards you
ever-so-slowly.

1738
02:02:14,259 --> 02:02:18,659
LIAM: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.

1739
02:02:18,659 --> 02:02:29,461
SAM: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the
room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the

1740
02:02:29,461 --> 02:02:44,006
crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us!
Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or

1741
02:02:44,006 --> 02:02:45,703
something? Do you have a hood?

1742
02:02:45,703 --> 02:02:47,519
MATT: The bones begin to drift.

1743
02:02:47,519 --> 02:02:51,524
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm not saying no.

1744
02:02:51,524 --> 02:02:54,441
LAURA: A handkerchief to put over the light.

1745
02:02:54,441 --> 02:02:59,700
SAM: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put
this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and

1746
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:03,907
bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only
hope.

1747
02:03:03,907 --> 02:03:05,719
MATT: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?

1748
02:03:05,719 --> 02:03:07,350
SAM: He's holding a blanket.

1749
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:09,087
TALIESIN and LAURA: He's holding a hanky.

1750
02:03:09,087 --> 02:03:11,216
TRAVIS: Put the bones down gently.

1751
02:03:11,216 --> 02:03:21,525
SAM: Give me the bones. I put the bones down.
Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the

1752
02:03:21,525 --> 02:03:24,717
crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to
us.

1753
02:03:24,717 --> 02:03:32,661
MATT: Simon begins to slowly walk, the
handkerchief floating by.

1754
02:03:32,661 --> 02:03:41,608
TALIESIN: This is like those little handkerchief
ghosts you would make in kindergarten.

1755
02:03:41,608 --> 02:03:45,915
MATT: As you glance inside and watch as it
happens, you can see all the undead that are in

1756
02:03:45,915 --> 02:03:55,304
there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit
in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them.

1757
02:03:55,304 --> 02:04:02,319
About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence.
You notice that all the undead are facing the

1758
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:03,988
crystal, by the way.

1759
02:04:03,988 --> 02:04:07,261
LAURA and MARISHA: Why didn't you tell us that
before?

1760
02:04:07,261 --> 02:04:11,331
MARISHA: (laughing) That's crucial information.

1761
02:04:11,331 --> 02:04:15,418
SAM: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as
far as you can.

1762
02:04:15,418 --> 02:04:16,957
TRAVIS: Not the lantern?

1763
02:04:16,957 --> 02:04:20,812
TALIESIN: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the
lantern and throw it.

1764
02:04:20,812 --> 02:04:25,968
MARISHA: By the way, they're all staring right at
you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.

1765
02:04:25,968 --> 02:04:28,947
MATT: They're not staring at you. They're staring
at the crystal.

1766
02:04:28,947 --> 02:04:33,707
LAURA: They will be staring at us. What if we
destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead

1767
02:04:33,707 --> 02:04:36,936
would die. Let's keep going.

1768
02:04:36,936 --> 02:04:44,554
MATT: The handkerchief makes its way forward.
Simon walks between the undead, and they don't

1769
02:04:44,554 --> 02:04:45,927
even notice.

1770
02:04:45,927 --> 02:04:49,100
SAM: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.

1771
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,676
MARISHA: What happens?

1772
02:04:50,676 --> 02:04:56,981
MATT: The handkerchief moves over onto the
crystal, and all the undead look over to the

1773
02:04:56,981 --> 02:05:00,824
crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin
to (groans).

1774
02:05:00,824 --> 02:05:09,217
TRAVIS: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I
throw the fucking piss out of it.

1775
02:05:09,217 --> 02:05:13,393
MATT: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your
strength modifier.

1776
02:05:13,393 --> 02:05:15,160
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good! 19.

1777
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:21,589
MATT: You're adding your strength modifier to
that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?

1778
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:26,334
TRAVIS: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it
in the opposite direction of where we are.

1779
02:05:26,334 --> 02:05:34,273
MATT: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it.
It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil

1780
02:05:34,273 --> 02:05:39,924
spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the
bright light that emanates from it and the flames

1781
02:05:39,924 --> 02:05:46,384
burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and
begin to retract away. Two of them are following

1782
02:05:46,384 --> 02:05:59,925
Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon,
currently. The others are distracted by the

1783
02:05:59,925 --> 02:06:03,185
detonation of flame. They look confused.

1784
02:06:03,185 --> 02:06:05,087
LIAM: How close are the pursuers?

1785
02:06:05,087 --> 02:06:12,217
MATT: They're making their way slowly. No, they're
much faster than Simon.

1786
02:06:12,217 --> 02:06:13,584
LIAM: I'm throwing.

1787
02:06:13,584 --> 02:06:15,361
LAURA: I'm going to get down and shoot.

1788
02:06:15,361 --> 02:06:16,930
MATT: Okay.

1789
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:21,807
LAURA: Just the ones following Simon!

1790
02:06:21,807 --> 02:06:23,820
MATT: Both of you guys roll an attack.

1791
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:26,116
TRAVIS: Are they far away from the other ones that
aren't leaving yet?

1792
02:06:26,116 --> 02:06:27,731
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter; they're not paying
attention.

1793
02:06:27,731 --> 02:06:29,790
LAURA: 25. No, 33.

1794
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,034
LIAM: 29.

1795
02:06:31,034 --> 02:06:32,270
MATT: Roll damage.

1796
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:38,019
TALIESIN: They drop out of nowhere. They faint.
It's going to be good.

1797
02:06:38,019 --> 02:06:39,581
MARISHA: So we hope.

1798
02:06:39,581 --> 02:06:45,169
TALIESIN: I thought you were made of sterner
stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get

1799
02:06:45,169 --> 02:06:46,670
squeamish.

1800
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:48,203
LAURA: 24.

1801
02:06:48,203 --> 02:06:49,760
TALIESIN: We made a solemn oath.

1802
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,997
SAM: They were innocent.

1803
02:06:52,997 --> 02:06:56,883
TALIESIN: We agreed, weeks ago.

1804
02:06:56,883 --> 02:07:00,515
LIAM: I rolled a 77 for mine.

1805
02:07:00,515 --> 02:07:02,510
SAM: 77?!

1806
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:12,218
MATT: These two skeletons almost atomize. As
they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon,

1807
02:07:12,218 --> 02:07:18,566
and as they both start reaching towards where the
dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the

1808
02:07:18,566 --> 02:07:23,667
handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl)
towards it. You watch as both their heads and

1809
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:29,698
torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy
wave of force blasted them across the stonework.

1810
02:07:29,698 --> 02:07:40,716
The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits.
The flames are dying down, and... no, no other

1811
02:07:40,716 --> 02:07:47,526
undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out
of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.

1812
02:07:47,526 --> 02:07:49,648
TALIESIN: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.

1813
02:07:49,648 --> 02:07:52,988
MATT: At this point, Simon's getting real close to
the end of his hour-long casting time.

1814
02:07:52,988 --> 02:07:54,993
SAM: You've served us well.

1815
02:07:54,993 --> 02:07:58,090
TRAVIS: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand,
or anything, does it?

1816
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:59,366
MATT: No.

1817
02:07:59,366 --> 02:08:01,005
TRAVIS: Cool! We've got that.

1818
02:08:01,005 --> 02:08:02,431
MATT: Whatever it is.

1819
02:08:02,431 --> 02:08:04,197
LAURA: I guess we have it.

1820
02:08:04,197 --> 02:08:07,586
MARISHA: Nothing happened to them when we put it
in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning)

1821
02:08:07,586 --> 02:08:09,803
and kept going? All the undead?

1822
02:08:09,803 --> 02:08:14,958
MATT: All the undead inside that were distracted
by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now,

1823
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:19,644
and they're starting to wander around, and some of
them are starting to make their way towards the

1824
02:08:19,644 --> 02:08:23,065
entrance to the temple. Some are making their way
toward the staircase to head upward.

1825
02:08:23,065 --> 02:08:24,551
MARISHA: Are we flying?

1826
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:26,178
TRAVIS: Yes, we fly up.

1827
02:08:26,178 --> 02:08:30,714
MATT: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax,
and all of you guys make your way up into the

1828
02:08:30,714 --> 02:08:31,790
cavern entrance.

1829
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:34,368
LAURA: Bubble. Tight bubble.

1830
02:08:34,368 --> 02:08:41,711
MATT: Currently, I believe the eagle form has
darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.

1831
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:44,777
LIAM: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.

1832
02:08:44,777 --> 02:08:51,022
MATT: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So
as you guys head up into the center part of the

1833
02:08:51,022 --> 02:08:57,976
cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you
push through, about a third of them are still

1834
02:08:57,976 --> 02:09:00,965
standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the
center, and there's edges of bridges that come to

1835
02:09:00,965 --> 02:09:07,706
a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down
into the cavern below. You can see straggling

1836
02:09:07,706 --> 02:09:12,831
undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways
along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward

1837
02:09:12,831 --> 02:09:22,018
through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising
through as fast as you can?

1838
02:09:22,018 --> 02:09:23,844
TALIESIN: Trying to avoid them.

1839
02:09:23,844 --> 02:09:25,538
LAURA: We'll try to avoid the clusters.

1840
02:09:25,538 --> 02:09:30,916
MATT: A few of them seem to glance up and see you
as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to

1841
02:09:30,916 --> 02:09:37,062
go. As you begin to cruise through the center of
this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it

1842
02:09:37,062 --> 02:09:42,898
widens further, and now as you look down, faintly,
you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent

1843
02:09:42,898 --> 02:09:48,932
fungus that are growing within this city below.
You can see elements of these beautiful statues

1844
02:09:48,932 --> 02:09:54,337
that are partially crumbled. You can see small
homes that litter the center of this chamber.

1845
02:09:54,337 --> 02:10:01,069
You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the
center of this actually meet in a suspended

1846
02:10:01,069 --> 02:10:10,072
platform that contains another dome-like structure
that is partially caved in. With another shake and

1847
02:10:10,072 --> 02:10:16,529
impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one
of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire

1848
02:10:16,529 --> 02:10:24,132
center finally gives way and falls and slams down,
collapsing into the center of the chamber, it

1849
02:10:24,132 --> 02:10:29,243
being there for the final moment of its tensile
strength. As it slams down, you watch as it

1850
02:10:29,243 --> 02:10:34,690
crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below,
and from that blast, you can see something on the

1851
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:40,199
interior of it was apparently explosive or
flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash

1852
02:10:40,199 --> 02:10:46,331
of light into the center of this cavern. Where you
had the brief outside of your visual range, you

1853
02:10:46,331 --> 02:10:51,807
now look around and see the entirety of these
dozens of catwalks and the city below you.

1854
02:10:51,807 --> 02:11:00,643
Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and
mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that

1855
02:11:00,643 --> 02:11:06,903
all glance towards this explosion. Some have been
blasted away from it by the impact of the

1856
02:11:06,903 --> 02:11:11,669
detonation. Others are making their way towards
what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but

1857
02:11:11,669 --> 02:11:18,751
you're keeping this central safe space between,
where none of them can grasp or assail you.

1858
02:11:18,751 --> 02:11:23,624
LAURA: Were there other buildings like that, ready
to fall from the ceiling?

1859
02:11:23,624 --> 02:11:25,925
MATT: Currently, what you see is just the one.

1860
02:11:25,925 --> 02:11:30,384
LIAM: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in
the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out.

1861
02:11:30,384 --> 02:11:34,386
MATT; You see entrances to homes that are
built into the sides.

1862
02:11:34,386 --> 02:11:38,772
SAM: What about a tunnel or anything?

1863
02:11:38,772 --> 02:11:43,823
MATT: Make a perception check. Anyone who has
darkvision can make a perception check.

1864
02:11:43,823 --> 02:11:46,950
MARISHA: I have keen sight. Does that count?

1865
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,953
MATT: You have advantage on your perception.

1866
02:11:48,953 --> 02:11:54,654
MARISHA: Oh, shitty and shittier.

1867
02:11:54,654 --> 02:11:56,355
LIAM: 27.

1868
02:11:56,355 --> 02:11:57,208
TRAVIS: 18.

1869
02:11:57,208 --> 02:11:58,003
LAURA: 18.

1870
02:11:58,003 --> 02:11:59,478
SAM: I didn't do one.

1871
02:11:59,478 --> 02:12:00,544
MARISHA: 28.

1872
02:12:00,544 --> 02:12:02,473
SAM: I'm weeping over Simon 2.

1873
02:12:02,473 --> 02:12:13,167
MATT: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said
you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?

1874
02:12:13,167 --> 02:12:18,096
MARISHA: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.

1875
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:23,651
MATT: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through
your eagle vision, you can see the top of the

1876
02:12:23,651 --> 02:12:30,333
chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape,
and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges

1877
02:12:30,333 --> 02:12:37,257
into a completely vertical chamber that rises up
and out of the central opening of the city of

1878
02:12:37,257 --> 02:12:38,535
Thomara.

1879
02:12:38,535 --> 02:12:40,963
SAM: Let's go.

1880
02:12:40,963 --> 02:12:47,372
MARISHA: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)

1881
02:12:47,372 --> 02:12:49,394
LAURA: (shushes) Caw quietly.

1882
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:55,273
LIAM: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.

1883
02:12:55,273 --> 02:12:58,507
TRAVIS: Debbie Downer.

1884
02:12:58,507 --> 02:13:04,336
LIAM: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all.
Every game until the end, motherfuckers!

1885
02:13:04,336 --> 02:13:13,825
MATT: As the group of you make your way up into
this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break.

1886
02:13:13,825 --> 02:13:17,137
I need to take a break, myself.

1887
02:13:17,137 --> 02:13:18,668
TRAVIS: Remember, we have the--

1888
02:13:18,668 --> 02:13:22,268
TRAVIS: Sponsored announcement.

1889
02:13:22,268 --> 02:13:27,059
MATT: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video
coming up at this break to give you a glance at

1890
02:13:27,059 --> 02:13:30,335
this game coming up that we're all part of. If you
haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it

1891
02:13:30,335 --> 02:13:35,450
out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this
week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little

1892
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:42,074
video for you here to show you what's up and what
you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay

1893
02:13:42,074 --> 02:13:45,091
attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys
here in a few minutes.

1894
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:46,382
LIAM: This is what's up!

1895
02:13:46,382 --> 02:13:47,921
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1896
02:13:47,921 --> 02:36:39,816
[break]

1897
02:36:39,816 --> 02:36:46,396
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All
right, so last we left off, you guys were all

1898
02:36:46,396 --> 02:36:55,956
traveling upward through various means of flight,
through a peak in the central cavern chamber in

1899
02:36:55,956 --> 02:37:00,083
the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven
city.

1900
02:37:00,083 --> 02:37:08,994
As you begin to climb upward through this
15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this

1901
02:37:08,994 --> 02:37:16,234
cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about
50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of

1902
02:37:16,234 --> 02:37:24,708
this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed
room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a

1903
02:37:24,708 --> 02:37:30,064
ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the
side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the

1904
02:37:30,064 --> 02:37:37,441
rest of you guys make your way in there. This
domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin,

1905
02:37:37,441 --> 02:37:44,797
circular floor around the outside with the hole
that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would

1906
02:37:44,797 --> 02:37:49,936
stand on the edge there would have the opportunity
to either leap into or toss something down into

1907
02:37:49,936 --> 02:37:54,356
this hole that would then drop them right
into the center of the city.

1908
02:37:54,356 --> 02:38:02,401
TALIESIN: Weird question: if I were holding the
blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what

1909
02:38:02,401 --> 02:38:05,724
would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely
where it ended up?

1910
02:38:05,724 --> 02:38:07,524
MATT: Not at all. It was a ways off.

1911
02:38:07,524 --> 02:38:08,974
TALIESIN: Just checking.

1912
02:38:08,974 --> 02:38:11,277
LAURA: Are there any undead around us right now?

1913
02:38:11,277 --> 02:38:14,120
MATT: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see
any undead.

1914
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:20,230
MARISHA: You said things or people? Is this a
body-sized hole?

1915
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:29,491
MATT: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full
chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About

1916
02:38:29,491 --> 02:38:38,692
a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the
center.

1917
02:38:38,692 --> 02:38:45,011
LIAM: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the
cave, or does it look made?

1918
02:38:45,011 --> 02:38:49,667
MATT: If you glance down and look about the
interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is

1919
02:38:49,667 --> 02:38:50,908
all carved.

1920
02:38:50,908 --> 02:38:56,047
LAURA: Can we look at the gem for a second, since
there's no undead around?

1921
02:38:56,047 --> 02:38:58,367
MATT: If you want to. Grog has it.

1922
02:38:58,367 --> 02:39:00,323
TRAVIS: Do you want me to pull it out?

1923
02:39:00,323 --> 02:39:02,374
LAURA: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?

1924
02:39:02,374 --> 02:39:04,329
SAM: Sure. I can look at it.

1925
02:39:04,329 --> 02:39:07,319
LAURA: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?

1926
02:39:07,319 --> 02:39:09,113
MATT: It's about that big.

1927
02:39:09,113 --> 02:39:12,936
TRAVIS: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody
that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?

1928
02:39:12,936 --> 02:39:14,800
LAURA: We can't see anything around us?

1929
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:16,520
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

1930
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:32,550
SAM: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I
inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18

1931
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,853
arcana check.

1932
02:39:33,853 --> 02:39:41,151
MATT: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue
light from it grows stronger, then weaker.

1933
02:39:41,151 --> 02:39:50,064
Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash
to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse

1934
02:39:50,064 --> 02:39:51,268
to it.

1935
02:39:51,268 --> 02:39:56,965
MARISHA: How is it lining up towards the steps of
the giant?

1936
02:39:56,965 --> 02:40:00,483
MATT: Not at all. It's much quicker.

1937
02:40:00,483 --> 02:40:01,931
MARISHA: Much quicker.

1938
02:40:01,931 --> 02:40:03,756
MATT: It's cold to the touch.

1939
02:40:03,756 --> 02:40:07,201
TALIESIN: Does it do anything to the Titanstone
Knuckles?

1940
02:40:07,201 --> 02:40:11,273
LIAM: Is it faster than my heartbeat?

1941
02:40:11,273 --> 02:40:13,126
MATT: It's slower.

1942
02:40:13,126 --> 02:40:14,339
LIAM: Slower.

1943
02:40:14,339 --> 02:40:16,525
TRAVIS: That's slow.

1944
02:40:16,525 --> 02:40:23,288
MARISHA: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the
rate he's walking.

1945
02:40:23,288 --> 02:40:27,585
TRAVIS: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?

1946
02:40:27,585 --> 02:40:38,105
MATT: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched
it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces;

1947
02:40:38,105 --> 02:40:40,765
it looks like there have been things that have
chipped off the stone.

1948
02:40:40,765 --> 02:40:43,011
TALIESIN: Does it have the vibe of something
petrified?

1949
02:40:43,011 --> 02:40:50,367
MATT: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it.
Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect,

1950
02:40:50,367 --> 02:40:54,156
and some areas appear to be clearer, and light
shines through a little brighter.

1951
02:40:54,156 --> 02:40:57,175
LIAM: It's like a hunk at the natural history
museum of minerals.

1952
02:40:57,175 --> 02:40:59,368
MATT: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.

1953
02:40:59,368 --> 02:41:05,802
SAM: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if
it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?

1954
02:41:05,802 --> 02:41:07,405
LAURA: You should do that.

1955
02:41:07,405 --> 02:41:09,065
LIAM: I'm going to do that.

1956
02:41:09,065 --> 02:41:14,256
MATT: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from
the stone.

1957
02:41:14,256 --> 02:41:18,732
SAM: You said no sense of evil?

1958
02:41:18,732 --> 02:41:20,822
MATT: No evil coming from the stone.

1959
02:41:20,822 --> 02:41:24,607
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super
hard.

1960
02:41:24,607 --> 02:41:28,347
MATT: You look really hard into the stone as you
hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross

1961
02:41:28,347 --> 02:41:38,649
as you glance into the very core source of this
pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.

1962
02:41:38,649 --> 02:41:40,368
LAURA: So bright, y'all.

1963
02:41:40,368 --> 02:41:42,630
MATT: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a
while.

1964
02:41:42,630 --> 02:41:46,003
LAURA: I saw so many things.

1965
02:41:46,003 --> 02:41:48,674
LIAM: She looked at the eclipse, too.

1966
02:41:48,674 --> 02:41:52,157
TRAVIS: We don't have Identify or anything like
that, do we?

1967
02:41:52,157 --> 02:41:53,679
MARISHA and SAM: No.

1968
02:41:53,679 --> 02:41:55,271
LAURA: You know who had that?

1969
02:41:55,271 --> 02:41:56,292
SAM: No, who?

1970
02:41:56,292 --> 02:41:57,810
LAURA: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.

1971
02:41:57,810 --> 02:42:04,392
SAM: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's
probably dead somewhere.

1972
02:42:04,392 --> 02:42:07,466
TRAVIS: I think we should try and smash it.

1973
02:42:07,466 --> 02:42:12,711
SAM: Don't you think that about everyone and
everything?

1974
02:42:12,711 --> 02:42:15,623
MARISHA: I'm not against this idea.

1975
02:42:15,623 --> 02:42:19,676
TRAVIS: What else are we going to do to it before
we face El Vecna?

1976
02:42:19,676 --> 02:42:24,018
TALIESIN: My only other thought of how it could be
useful, at this point, with what we know about it--

1977
02:42:24,018 --> 02:42:26,111
SAM: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?

1978
02:42:26,111 --> 02:42:28,607
TRAVIS: Sí.

1979
02:42:28,607 --> 02:42:33,054
TALIESIN: It seemed like the undead were crowding
towards it, which means that if we do get attacked

1980
02:42:33,054 --> 02:42:38,481
by a group of undead, we might be able to
shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's

1981
02:42:38,481 --> 02:42:40,029
dangerous in their hands.

1982
02:42:40,029 --> 02:42:47,302
TRAVIS: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a
hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.

1983
02:42:47,302 --> 02:42:51,867
TALIESIN: That literally made the dungeon master
laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--

1984
02:42:51,867 --> 02:42:55,370
TRAVIS: It's blue, right? That is the color of
hydrogen.

1985
02:42:55,370 --> 02:42:59,974
TALIESIN: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I
don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.

1986
02:42:59,974 --> 02:43:01,627
TRAVIS: It is known.

1987
02:43:01,627 --> 02:43:08,533
SAM: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a
moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.

1988
02:43:08,533 --> 02:43:10,490
TALIESIN: Not crazy, trying to crack it.

1989
02:43:10,490 --> 02:43:21,464
LIAM: What if it stops this thing where it stands?
We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.

1990
02:43:21,464 --> 02:43:22,983
SAM: Its heart?

1991
02:43:22,983 --> 02:43:25,427
TRAVIS: It's palm-sized, right?

1992
02:43:25,427 --> 02:43:27,091
TALIESIN: It could be a chunk of heart.

1993
02:43:27,091 --> 02:43:29,885
LAURA: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?

1994
02:43:29,885 --> 02:43:35,172
TRAVIS: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue
crystal.

1995
02:43:35,172 --> 02:43:41,525
MATT: There's nothing about it that gives you the
sense, based on what you've seen both outside and

1996
02:43:41,525 --> 02:43:46,246
within the titan, that it is of similar essence to
the titan, from what you understand.

1997
02:43:46,246 --> 02:43:48,332
TRAVIS: It could be a soul or something.

1998
02:43:48,332 --> 02:43:50,295
SAM: Soul glow?

1999
02:43:50,295 --> 02:43:53,274
TRAVIS: Does Pike have anything that detects a
soul?

2000
02:43:53,274 --> 02:43:59,864
LIAM: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be
the thing that's keeping these undead moving.

2001
02:43:59,864 --> 02:44:05,237
TRAVIS: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I
think we keep moving.

2002
02:44:05,237 --> 02:44:08,304
LIAM: I like the spiking idea.

2003
02:44:08,304 --> 02:44:12,153
LAURA: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.

2004
02:44:12,153 --> 02:44:16,214
LIAM: I think that you should let me squish it,
because if that blows up--

2005
02:44:16,214 --> 02:44:20,521
LAURA: I think it's funny that we spent so much
time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.

2006
02:44:20,521 --> 02:44:23,247
LIAM: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.

2007
02:44:23,247 --> 02:44:27,466
TRAVIS: We'll think about smashing it when we take
our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.

2008
02:44:27,466 --> 02:44:30,920
TALIESIN: Hold onto it for now. It could come in
handy.

2009
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:36,261
MARISHA: It's like that dress you bought four
years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a

2010
02:44:36,261 --> 02:44:37,374
purpose.

2011
02:44:37,374 --> 02:44:39,487
SAM: All right, focus!

2012
02:44:39,487 --> 02:44:41,702
LAURA: Let's get out of this dome.

2013
02:44:41,702 --> 02:44:46,946
TRAVIS: Is there any writing or engraving or runes
on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?

2014
02:44:46,946 --> 02:44:55,774
MATT: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth
stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening

2015
02:44:55,774 --> 02:44:57,099
of some kind.

2016
02:44:57,099 --> 02:44:58,614
TALIESIN: Are there exits?

2017
02:44:58,614 --> 02:45:03,041
MATT: Make an investigation check. You don't see
any doorways or passageways.

2018
02:45:03,041 --> 02:45:05,226
MARISHA: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go
up?

2019
02:45:05,226 --> 02:45:10,173
MATT: There's a hole that you came through to come
into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the

2020
02:45:10,173 --> 02:45:11,249
chamber.

2021
02:45:11,249 --> 02:45:13,879
TALIESIN: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that
there's a hole.

2022
02:45:13,879 --> 02:45:18,291
MATT: You get vertigo as you stand in the
chamber.

2023
02:45:18,291 --> 02:45:20,197
LAURA: Is this investigation or perception?

2024
02:45:20,197 --> 02:45:27,807
MATT: You look about, and you don't see any exit.
Investigation to see if there's any hidden or

2025
02:45:27,807 --> 02:45:33,445
not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.

2026
02:45:33,445 --> 02:45:34,627
LAURA: 23.

2027
02:45:34,627 --> 02:45:45,478
MATT: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely
along the wall, you see two small domed doors

2028
02:45:45,478 --> 02:45:52,489
that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a
small barricade that's been placed down on one

2029
02:45:52,489 --> 02:45:57,831
side of a doorway. However, they are closed from
this side.

2030
02:45:57,831 --> 02:45:59,502
LAURA: So you could open them up?

2031
02:45:59,502 --> 02:46:00,603
MATT: You could.

2032
02:46:00,603 --> 02:46:02,269
LAURA: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if
they're trapped.

2033
02:46:02,269 --> 02:46:03,825
LIAM: On it.

2034
02:46:03,825 --> 02:46:07,537
TRAVIS: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the
other side of that door--

2035
02:46:07,537 --> 02:46:08,991
LIAM: 27.

2036
02:46:08,991 --> 02:46:10,252
MATT: 27?

2037
02:46:10,252 --> 02:46:12,135
LAURA: I rolled an 18.

2038
02:46:12,135 --> 02:46:13,613
MATT: You're both looking at the same one?

2039
02:46:13,613 --> 02:46:14,911
LIAM: Yeah.

2040
02:46:14,911 --> 02:46:17,441
MATT: Neither of you notice any traps.

2041
02:46:17,441 --> 02:46:21,606
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy
open that lock.

2042
02:46:21,606 --> 02:46:22,988
TRAVIS: Whoa.

2043
02:46:22,988 --> 02:46:24,094
LAURA: I already said it.

2044
02:46:24,094 --> 02:46:25,474
MATT: Make a strength check.

2045
02:46:25,474 --> 02:46:26,870
LIAM: Not locked.

2046
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:39,193
LAURA: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up
strength, not a saving throw? Two!

2047
02:46:39,193 --> 02:46:41,397
SAM: Two?

2048
02:46:41,397 --> 02:46:47,139
LAURA: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be
stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.

2049
02:46:47,139 --> 02:46:49,971
TRAVIS: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.

2050
02:46:49,971 --> 02:46:52,372
LAURA: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and
(grunts).

2051
02:46:52,372 --> 02:46:54,245
MATT: It is not budging.

2052
02:46:54,245 --> 02:47:00,861
LIAM: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's
locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception

2053
02:47:00,861 --> 02:47:03,902
check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if
it's locked?

2054
02:47:03,902 --> 02:47:08,503
MATT: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it.
There is no handle.

2055
02:47:08,503 --> 02:47:15,024
LIAM: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with
my lock-picking skills.

2056
02:47:15,024 --> 02:47:17,710
TRAVIS and MARISHA: It's a barricade.

2057
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:19,440
LIAM: There's nothing to do?

2058
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:22,639
MARISHA: It's like steel rebar in front of the
door.

2059
02:47:22,639 --> 02:47:31,019
TRAVIS: Is there any decorating or writing or
scratching around the door frame or wall around

2060
02:47:31,019 --> 02:47:33,458
the door? Anything other than a portal to go
through?

2061
02:47:33,458 --> 02:47:39,259
MATT: Not from what you can see, no. The room's
pretty simple. The construction of it may be older

2062
02:47:39,259 --> 02:47:44,758
than most of the things that you've seen in the
city below and previous chambers. It seems to be

2063
02:47:44,758 --> 02:47:48,213
built almost for function rather than ceremony.

2064
02:47:48,213 --> 02:47:50,171
LAURA: It's a trash chute.

2065
02:47:50,171 --> 02:47:53,997
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say. Is it a
water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?

2066
02:47:53,997 --> 02:48:01,085
LAURA: We could fill the city with water. Drown
all the zombies.

2067
02:48:01,085 --> 02:48:05,433
MATT: One thing you do notice, which is
interesting as you're glancing around at the side,

2068
02:48:05,433 --> 02:48:12,985
looking at the ground at the bottom of it,
there's a very faint groove in the ground that

2069
02:48:12,985 --> 02:48:16,893
leads toward the central hole at the base of each
of these doorways.

2070
02:48:16,893 --> 02:48:21,398
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any other type of
chutes coming into this room?

2071
02:48:21,398 --> 02:48:24,944
MATT: No, just the two doors on the opposite
sides.

2072
02:48:24,944 --> 02:48:26,534
TRAVIS: How far apart are the doors?

2073
02:48:26,534 --> 02:48:28,333
MATT: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.

2074
02:48:28,333 --> 02:48:30,871
TALIESIN: So there's a bar. The door is barred,
then?

2075
02:48:30,871 --> 02:48:31,942
MATT: Correct.

2076
02:48:31,942 --> 02:48:35,602
TALIESIN: So break it. Let's get out of the way
and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right

2077
02:48:35,602 --> 02:48:36,771
off the door.

2078
02:48:36,771 --> 02:48:41,717
TRAVIS: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case
900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she

2079
02:48:41,717 --> 02:48:43,669
can Wall of Stone the door?

2080
02:48:43,669 --> 02:48:47,926
MARISHA: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind
you, man.

2081
02:48:47,926 --> 02:48:54,086
TRAVIS: I will try and remove one of the doors. I
don't know how to delineate between them.

2082
02:48:54,086 --> 02:48:55,731
TALIESIN: The left one.

2083
02:48:55,731 --> 02:49:04,510
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.

2084
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:15,517
MATT: 25. It immediately comes off to the side,
and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted

2085
02:49:15,517 --> 02:49:21,193
to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and
holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.

2086
02:49:21,193 --> 02:49:25,803
LAURA: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think
I loosened it for you, Grog.

2087
02:49:25,803 --> 02:49:27,681
TRAVIS: I didn't get that sense at all.

2088
02:49:27,681 --> 02:49:33,143
MATT: As you lift it up, the door is now
unbarred.

2089
02:49:33,143 --> 02:49:35,270
TRAVIS: Shall I?

2090
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:36,833
LAURA: Yeah, open the door!

2091
02:49:36,833 --> 02:49:40,902
TRAVIS: Are the hinges on this side so it looks
like it opens towards me?

2092
02:49:40,902 --> 02:49:43,362
MATT: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.

2093
02:49:43,362 --> 02:49:44,970
TRAVIS: I'll pull open the door.

2094
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:46,710
MARISHA: I'm at the ready for whatever.

2095
02:49:46,710 --> 02:50:01,036
MATT: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed,
the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that

2096
02:50:01,036 --> 02:50:10,828
one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple
of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight

2097
02:50:10,828 --> 02:50:13,684
mass of earth and stone.

2098
02:50:13,684 --> 02:50:15,070
LAURA: Shit! Let's try the other one.

2099
02:50:15,070 --> 02:50:18,446
TRAVIS: Should I punch the rubble?

2100
02:50:18,446 --> 02:50:20,479
LAURA: No, let's try the other door first.

2101
02:50:20,479 --> 02:50:22,275
TRAVIS: I make my way around.

2102
02:50:22,275 --> 02:50:23,759
TALIESIN: We set ourselves up.

2103
02:50:23,759 --> 02:50:28,537
TRAVIS: 20 on the dot.

2104
02:50:28,537 --> 02:50:37,132
MATT: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without
an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open,

2105
02:50:37,132 --> 02:50:49,731
and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide
incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.

2106
02:50:49,731 --> 02:50:53,824
TRAVIS: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.

2107
02:50:53,824 --> 02:50:56,370
LAURA: How big is the tunnel?

2108
02:50:56,370 --> 02:51:01,316
MATT: It's about four feet wide or so.

2109
02:51:01,316 --> 02:51:02,695
LAURA: So we can fit in?

2110
02:51:02,695 --> 02:51:03,828
MATT: Yeah, you can fit in.

2111
02:51:03,828 --> 02:51:05,777
TALIESIN: We have some Immovable Rods.

2112
02:51:05,777 --> 02:51:14,523
MATT: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like
an actual slide. You get the sense that there was

2113
02:51:14,523 --> 02:51:20,442
some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.

2114
02:51:20,442 --> 02:51:25,063
LAURA: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure
we don't slide down.

2115
02:51:25,063 --> 02:51:28,251
TALIESIN: Whoever's in the back should have the
Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of

2116
02:51:28,251 --> 02:51:30,556
water, we can create a grate for ourselves.

2117
02:51:30,556 --> 02:51:35,225
MATT: You envision that at one point, long ago,
this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the

2118
02:51:35,225 --> 02:51:37,335
center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.

2119
02:51:37,335 --> 02:51:42,601
TRAVIS: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy
as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be

2120
02:51:42,601 --> 02:51:43,868
the caboose.

2121
02:51:43,868 --> 02:51:47,174
MARISHA: I've got the other one, so I'll be
second.

2122
02:51:47,174 --> 02:51:49,362
MATT: So Grog is the caboose.

2123
02:51:49,362 --> 02:51:51,420
MARISHA: Keyleth in front of Grog.

2124
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:54,199
MATT: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's
in front of them?

2125
02:51:54,199 --> 02:51:55,481
SAM: Me.

2126
02:51:55,481 --> 02:51:56,849
MATT: Scanlan.

2127
02:51:56,849 --> 02:51:58,081
LAURA: Pike.

2128
02:51:58,081 --> 02:51:59,598
MATT: Then Pike. All righty.

2129
02:51:59,598 --> 02:52:01,790
TALIESIN: Myself and the twins, I suppose.

2130
02:52:01,790 --> 02:52:03,428
LAURA: Yeah. I want to be in the front.

2131
02:52:03,428 --> 02:52:06,392
TRAVIS: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod
out and have it in my hand.

2132
02:52:06,392 --> 02:52:07,714
MARISHA: Samesies.

2133
02:52:07,714 --> 02:52:14,044
MATT: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally
forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I

2134
02:52:14,044 --> 02:52:20,950
should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner.
Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry

2135
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:27,644
deck box soon. Now that's taken care of.

2136
02:52:27,644 --> 02:52:34,575
You make your way up the slide, and it's
relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a

2137
02:52:34,575 --> 02:52:47,024
scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and
about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate

2138
02:52:47,024 --> 02:52:55,850
out and appear to break into two smaller chambers,
like this was a breaking point where a person

2139
02:52:55,850 --> 02:53:04,405
could enter from either side to check on the flow
or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The

2140
02:53:04,405 --> 02:53:10,864
slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to
that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right

2141
02:53:10,864 --> 02:53:20,594
to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like
there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the

2142
02:53:20,594 --> 02:53:22,718
left, a staircase.

2143
02:53:22,718 --> 02:53:25,962
MARISHA: So it looks like a landing?

2144
02:53:25,962 --> 02:53:31,433
MATT: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed
to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or

2145
02:53:31,433 --> 02:53:34,785
checking on the flow of water.

2146
02:53:34,785 --> 02:53:37,976
LAURA: Keep going up the slide or take the
stairs?

2147
02:53:37,976 --> 02:53:39,528
LIAM: Quick glance in the crates?

2148
02:53:39,528 --> 02:53:42,715
MARISHA: No, if you're going to take a quick
glance, then we have to bust them open like a

2149
02:53:42,715 --> 02:53:44,137
proper RPG.

2150
02:53:44,137 --> 02:53:48,972
TRAVIS: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.

2151
02:53:48,972 --> 02:53:50,975
MATT: They will. What do you do?

2152
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:54,740
LIAM: Check them out. I eat some edamame.

2153
02:53:54,740 --> 02:54:01,846
MATT: So you lift the crates. There are only two
of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by

2154
02:54:01,846 --> 02:54:09,479
two feet. The first one, you open up and look
inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron

2155
02:54:09,479 --> 02:54:16,740
bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like
whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct

2156
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:22,506
system for this, this box contained materials,
though you're uncertain as to what their

2157
02:54:22,506 --> 02:54:26,468
application was into this system.

2158
02:54:26,468 --> 02:54:31,426
TALIESIN: I'll take a glance at these things to
memorize their general shape.

2159
02:54:31,426 --> 02:54:34,512
TRAVIS: After you're done with them, I'll actually
take them.

2160
02:54:34,512 --> 02:54:43,185
MATT: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of
varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet

2161
02:54:43,185 --> 02:54:53,047
elements, where they fit around different metal
caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar

2162
02:54:53,047 --> 02:54:59,122
that's used to hold or wedge elements separately.
Very basic; nothing too intricate.

2163
02:54:59,122 --> 02:55:03,641
TALIESIN: This is some basic shit that you're
picking up right now.

2164
02:55:03,641 --> 02:55:07,072
LIAM: That was the first crate. What's the next
crate? Is it whoopee cushions?

2165
02:55:07,072 --> 02:55:14,930
MATT: No, the next crate you open up and it looks
mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple

2166
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:23,115
of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear
to be broken or shattered, but there are three

2167
02:55:23,115 --> 02:55:28,192
remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the
inside.

2168
02:55:28,192 --> 02:55:31,701
LAURA: Does that sound familiar to us at all?

2169
02:55:31,701 --> 02:55:34,740
LIAM: Healing potions are blue.

2170
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:37,777
MATT: These don't resemble healing potions,
actually.

2171
02:55:37,777 --> 02:55:42,420
TALIESIN: Do these resemble underwater breathing?

2172
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:44,397
MATT: They do. You've seen these before.

2173
02:55:44,397 --> 02:55:48,363
LIAM: For toilet diving.

2174
02:55:48,363 --> 02:55:51,502
TALIESIN: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.

2175
02:55:51,502 --> 02:55:53,150
TRAVIS: Okay. I got them.

2176
02:55:53,150 --> 02:56:00,809
LIAM: I give one of them to Percy for being so
sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it.

2177
02:56:00,809 --> 02:56:05,533
I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give
one to Scanlan.

2178
02:56:05,533 --> 02:56:07,134
SAM: I give it to Grog.

2179
02:56:07,134 --> 02:56:09,795
TRAVIS: I've got one. I've got two, actually.

2180
02:56:09,795 --> 02:56:11,773
SAM: All right, then I'll keep one.

2181
02:56:11,773 --> 02:56:13,477
TALIESIN: Just in case.

2182
02:56:13,477 --> 02:56:15,295
TRAVIS: I've got two vials of underwater
breathing.

2183
02:56:15,295 --> 02:56:18,433
MATT: All righty.

2184
02:56:18,433 --> 02:56:23,092
TALIESIN: Why is there no water running?

2185
02:56:23,092 --> 02:56:25,545
TRAVIS: Any other boxes to smash?

2186
02:56:25,545 --> 02:56:26,945
MATT: No.

2187
02:56:26,945 --> 02:56:29,970
MARISHA: I'd imagine because he's vertical now
instead of horizontal.

2188
02:56:29,970 --> 02:56:31,388
TRAVIS: And undead.

2189
02:56:31,388 --> 02:56:35,123
SAM: Let's keep going up the stairs.

2190
02:56:35,123 --> 02:56:40,338
MATT: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same
order?

2191
02:56:40,338 --> 02:56:42,020
LIAM: 30 to 40 feet in advance.

2192
02:56:42,020 --> 02:56:49,867
MATT: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay.
You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.

2193
02:56:49,867 --> 02:56:51,993
TRAVIS: Immovable Rod's out.

2194
02:56:51,993 --> 02:56:55,587
LIAM: 28 for stealth.

2195
02:56:55,587 --> 02:56:59,797
MATT: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you
going along with him, or are you letting him go

2196
02:56:59,797 --> 02:57:00,737
ahead?

2197
02:57:00,737 --> 02:57:02,172
LIAM: She's coming.

2198
02:57:02,172 --> 02:57:03,652
LAURA: Natural 20.

2199
02:57:03,652 --> 02:57:08,287
MATT: All right, so the two of you very quietly
make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping

2200
02:57:08,287 --> 02:57:15,053
within, I assume, the range of the ring. The
staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or

2201
02:57:15,053 --> 02:57:21,886
so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're
stepping up through the floor, and there's about

2202
02:57:21,886 --> 02:57:27,945
ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a
slight element of a cave-in to the left of you,

2203
02:57:27,945 --> 02:57:34,097
where part of the stone seems to have collapsed,
and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a

2204
02:57:34,097 --> 02:57:40,761
smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The
walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like

2205
02:57:40,761 --> 02:57:48,133
angle. There are other portions of the wall that
have caved in on certain elements, and there are

2206
02:57:48,133 --> 02:57:54,288
two large pillars that mark the center of this
hallway, either used as support beams or

2207
02:57:54,288 --> 02:57:57,728
decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor.

2208
02:57:57,728 --> 02:58:07,334
You glance over the side, and you see a distant
staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80

2209
02:58:07,334 --> 02:58:13,331
to 90 feet from where you are, if not further,
with larger stairs. You've seen some of the

2210
02:58:13,331 --> 02:58:20,531
dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more
grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part

2211
02:58:20,531 --> 02:58:26,057
of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a
wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved

2212
02:58:26,057 --> 02:58:39,421
out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed
through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very

2213
02:58:39,421 --> 02:58:54,469
faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration.
You also see a figure stepping from a side wall

2214
02:58:54,469 --> 02:59:01,944
crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the
circular opening in the wall.

2215
02:59:01,944 --> 02:59:03,285
LIAM: I hide.

2216
02:59:03,285 --> 02:59:04,586
LAURA: We were stealthed.

2217
02:59:04,586 --> 02:59:07,597
MATT: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while
stealthed.

2218
02:59:07,597 --> 02:59:11,793
LIAM: That's what I do.

2219
02:59:11,793 --> 02:59:16,934
MATT: You hear some muttering across the way in
the shadow. There's a faint source of light that

2220
02:59:16,934 --> 02:59:22,695
looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the
air above and giving this faint greenish-white

2221
02:59:22,695 --> 02:59:30,580
light; a bauble that's giving a light source to
whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the

2222
02:59:30,580 --> 02:59:38,305
muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to
join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of

2223
02:59:38,305 --> 02:59:44,433
light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one
of them that is the symbol, the hole with the

2224
02:59:44,433 --> 02:59:47,854
metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.

2225
02:59:47,854 --> 02:59:50,595
SAM: Remnants?

2226
02:59:50,595 --> 02:59:56,540
MATT: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer
or shine on the metal from the light cast from the

2227
02:59:56,540 --> 02:59:57,623
bauble.

2228
02:59:57,623 --> 02:59:59,200
MARISHA and TALIESIN: What?

2229
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:03,422
TALIESIN: This can't be happening right now.

2230
03:00:03,422 --> 03:00:06,394
LIAM: We don't recognize faces? We don't see
faces?

2231
03:00:06,394 --> 03:00:09,366
MATT: You see hooded figures that are walking in.
There are three of them.

2232
03:00:09,366 --> 03:00:12,672
MARISHA: Oh, so they're cultists.

2233
03:00:12,672 --> 03:00:18,525
MATT: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at?
There's three of them.

2234
03:00:18,525 --> 03:00:20,244
LAURA: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.

2235
03:00:20,244 --> 03:00:29,088
MATT: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out
of the center of the hall there, and then the two

2236
03:00:29,088 --> 03:00:32,942
others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at
the one that came out of the side of the wall?

2237
03:00:32,942 --> 03:00:35,833
LAURA: Has he seen the two coming down the
stairway yet?

2238
03:00:35,833 --> 03:00:39,879
MATT: There's been discussion over the shoulder.
They seem to be aware of each other's presence,

2239
03:00:39,879 --> 03:00:46,753
but they haven't come together to engage as three
in the same area yet.

2240
03:00:46,753 --> 03:00:55,517
LIAM: I will follow my sister's lead. If she
attacks one, I send one to another one and two to

2241
03:00:55,517 --> 03:00:57,144
the third.

2242
03:00:57,144 --> 03:00:59,985
LAURA: I'll attack the first so he can take the
second.

2243
03:00:59,985 --> 03:01:01,803
LIAM: One. Two, three.

2244
03:01:01,803 --> 03:01:03,134
MATT: Okay.

2245
03:01:03,134 --> 03:01:04,178
LIAM: Yeah.

2246
03:01:04,178 --> 03:01:05,531
MATT: All righty.

2247
03:01:05,531 --> 03:01:09,539
LAURA: These are auto-crits, though, because we
are surprising them.

2248
03:01:09,539 --> 03:01:10,995
MATT: This is true.

2249
03:01:10,995 --> 03:01:15,389
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark him?

2250
03:01:15,389 --> 03:01:22,102
MATT: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.

2251
03:01:22,102 --> 03:01:30,029
LAURA: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack?
It's an auto-crit.

2252
03:01:30,029 --> 03:01:34,415
MATT: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if
you aim. You have advantage on the attack.

2253
03:01:34,415 --> 03:01:39,098
LAURA: 27.

2254
03:01:39,098 --> 03:01:41,069
LIAM: 27 on my first.

2255
03:01:41,069 --> 03:01:43,277
MATT: Okay, both hit.

2256
03:01:43,277 --> 03:01:52,826
LAURA: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the
second attack.

2257
03:01:52,826 --> 03:01:54,518
MATT: Okay, that hits.

2258
03:01:54,518 --> 03:01:58,533
LAURA: I got a one on both. Thank god they were
both at advantage.

2259
03:01:58,533 --> 03:02:03,741
LIAM: 27. 19, 25.

2260
03:02:03,741 --> 03:02:07,181
MATT: Okay, all three hit.

2261
03:02:07,181 --> 03:02:09,670
LAURA: And they're all critical?

2262
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:12,039
MATT: No, the first one crits.

2263
03:02:12,039 --> 03:02:14,994
LIAM: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak
attack.

2264
03:02:14,994 --> 03:02:17,749
MATT: They're not all crit. Once you hit the
person they are no longer surprised.

2265
03:02:17,749 --> 03:02:22,419
LAURA: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid!
That's okay.

2266
03:02:22,419 --> 03:02:24,288
MAIRSHA: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.

2267
03:02:24,288 --> 03:02:27,331
LIAM: You are the most powerful person at this
table.

2268
03:02:27,331 --> 03:02:38,744
LAURA: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you
know what? Should I single out the lightning

2269
03:02:38,744 --> 03:02:40,747
damage or say what all the damage is?

2270
03:02:40,747 --> 03:02:43,332
MATT: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage
is doubled, as well.

2271
03:02:43,332 --> 03:02:45,701
LAURA: So it's 12 lightning damage.

2272
03:02:45,756 --> 03:02:47,714
MATT: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack
damage is.

2273
03:02:47,714 --> 03:02:49,051
LAURA: Okay.

2274
03:02:49,051 --> 03:02:56,515
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's happening.

2275
03:02:56,515 --> 03:03:00,806
TRAVIS: You already did 40 point of damage without
doubling.

2276
03:03:00,806 --> 03:03:02,197
LAURA: Don't do that.

2277
03:03:02,197 --> 03:03:10,403
SAM: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic
damage rolls.

2278
03:03:10,403 --> 03:03:15,484
TALIESIN: Huge, mammoth.

2279
03:03:15,484 --> 03:03:18,653
SAM: Huge, bulbous.

2280
03:03:18,653 --> 03:03:20,202
TALIESIN: Turgid.

2281
03:03:20,202 --> 03:03:26,696
LAURA: I had already rolled that, but it was a six
again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.

2282
03:03:26,696 --> 03:03:28,884
MATT: 52 points of damage.

2283
03:03:28,884 --> 03:03:38,846
LIAM: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48,
done.

2284
03:03:38,846 --> 03:03:42,782
LAURA: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that
first guy.

2285
03:03:42,782 --> 03:03:44,478
MATT: This is on the other guy; the second guy.

2286
03:03:44,478 --> 03:03:48,265
LAURA: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the
first one.

2287
03:03:48,265 --> 03:03:50,707
MARISHA: Little bit of that reach around.

2288
03:03:50,707 --> 03:03:56,287
SAM: The dice smell a little bit.

2289
03:03:56,287 --> 03:03:58,671
LIAM: 48. 20, ten.

2290
03:03:58,671 --> 03:04:01,150
MATT: So 48 on your critical.

2291
03:04:01,150 --> 03:04:04,298
LIAM: That's the critical. That's the dice damage.
I rolled really low.

2292
03:04:04,298 --> 03:04:15,152
MATT: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you
shooting the same guy, Laura?

2293
03:04:15,152 --> 03:04:23,482
LAURA: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down.
Would I notice?

2294
03:04:23,482 --> 03:04:25,093
MATT: No, he did not go down.

2295
03:04:25,093 --> 03:04:38,436
LAURA: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the
second one.

2296
03:04:38,436 --> 03:04:41,338
MATT: That does it.

2297
03:04:41,338 --> 03:04:46,497
TRAVIS: How much damage? Total.

2298
03:04:46,497 --> 03:04:52,406
MATT: Total on that round from you would have been
110 with the first hit between the two of you on

2299
03:04:52,406 --> 03:05:01,533
the first guy and the second hit. So the one that
was off to the side, who is leaning forward,

2300
03:05:01,533 --> 03:05:06,449
hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The
first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches

2301
03:05:06,449 --> 03:05:12,635
for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into
the face, into the socket where there is no eye,

2302
03:05:12,635 --> 03:05:18,240
which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out
as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye

2303
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:27,903
out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead.
Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as

2304
03:05:27,903 --> 03:05:34,286
the two other daggers go into the other two, they
both see the one crumple to the ground, the two

2305
03:05:34,286 --> 03:05:36,540
left there, the guy who is standing at the
stairs--

2306
03:05:36,540 --> 03:05:38,339
LIAM: May I also dump some poison?

2307
03:05:38,339 --> 03:05:40,349
MATT: Sure, into which one?

2308
03:05:40,349 --> 03:05:46,734
LIAM: Into the first one. I did one into my first
target and two into the second; the poison would

2309
03:05:46,734 --> 03:05:49,171
have gone into the second person. It's a DC of
15.

2310
03:05:49,171 --> 03:05:57,841
MATT: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds.
16.

2311
03:05:57,841 --> 03:05:59,193
LIAM: So nothing, right?

2312
03:05:59,193 --> 03:06:00,498
MATT: Nothing, yeah.

2313
03:06:00,498 --> 03:06:01,697
LIAM: Balls!

2314
03:06:01,697 --> 03:06:07,698
MATT: As soon as the one crumples to the ground
and the two other daggers into the other two that

2315
03:06:07,698 --> 03:06:12,650
are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall.
The one in the center of the chamber glances over

2316
03:06:12,650 --> 03:06:20,577
his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky
one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found

2317
03:06:20,577 --> 03:06:26,003
"sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left
begins to run up the stairs.

2318
03:06:26,003 --> 03:06:27,626
LAURA: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?

2319
03:06:27,626 --> 03:06:29,900
MATT: Nope because you took your turn. This is
their reaction.

2320
03:06:29,900 --> 03:06:33,642
SAM: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?

2321
03:06:33,642 --> 03:06:36,155
LIAM: Initiative!

2322
03:06:36,155 --> 03:06:38,988
MATT: We're about to roll initiative,
motherfuckers.

2323
03:06:38,988 --> 03:06:40,906
LAURA: Sorry, guys. We did it.

2324
03:06:40,906 --> 03:06:46,995
MARISHA: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon
before.

2325
03:06:46,995 --> 03:06:48,983
SAM: We've also heard the name Odell.

2326
03:06:48,983 --> 03:06:50,495
LIAM: Yeah, Odell.

2327
03:06:50,495 --> 03:07:02,921
MARISHA: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors.
Wait, when did we hear Odell before?

2328
03:07:02,921 --> 03:07:04,858
LIAM: I just know we've heard it.

2329
03:07:04,858 --> 03:07:16,143
SAM: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign,
too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.

2330
03:07:16,143 --> 03:07:18,733
MATT: Everyone else is still down the stairs right
there.

2331
03:07:18,733 --> 03:07:21,990
LAURA: I wonder if we should have let them talk
for a second. Oh, well.

2332
03:07:21,990 --> 03:07:23,534
LIAM: That's not our way.

2333
03:07:23,534 --> 03:07:31,790
MATT: Apparently not, as recent events have shown.
So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.

2334
03:07:31,790 --> 03:07:35,748
TRAVIS: Don't fuck me, Gil.

2335
03:07:35,748 --> 03:07:43,398
LAURA: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.

2336
03:07:43,398 --> 03:07:47,545
MARISHA: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.

2337
03:07:47,545 --> 03:07:49,700
TALIESIN: Leave one of them alive, but don't let
them leave.

2338
03:07:49,700 --> 03:07:51,692
LIAM: Not good for Pike.

2339
03:07:51,692 --> 03:07:59,351
MARISHA: Did everyone roll shittily?

2340
03:07:59,351 --> 03:08:00,640
TRAVIS: No.

2341
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:02,209
MATT: 25 to 20?

2342
03:08:02,209 --> 03:08:03,594
LAURA: 23.

2343
03:08:03,594 --> 03:08:04,657
TRAVIS: 21.

2344
03:08:04,657 --> 03:08:08,306
LIAM: Get that long range. Get that runner.

2345
03:08:08,306 --> 03:08:09,733
MATT: 20 to 15?

2346
03:08:09,733 --> 03:08:10,797
SAM: 18.

2347
03:08:10,797 --> 03:08:11,809
MARISHA: 15.

2348
03:08:11,809 --> 03:08:13,561
MATT: All righty.

2349
03:08:13,561 --> 03:08:17,937
MARISHA: What's up, bro?

2350
03:08:17,937 --> 03:08:20,347
LIAM: I'm not fast.

2351
03:08:20,347 --> 03:08:27,678
TALIESIN: 13.

2352
03:08:27,678 --> 03:08:30,301
LIAM: 13.

2353
03:08:30,301 --> 03:08:31,520
TRAVIS: That's weird for you.

2354
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:33,122
TALIESIN: It's almost as low as I can go.

2355
03:08:33,122 --> 03:08:36,454
MATT: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?

2356
03:08:36,454 --> 03:08:37,904
LIAM: Pike clocked in at four.

2357
03:08:37,904 --> 03:08:40,055
MATT: Pike is clocking in as Pike.

2358
03:08:40,055 --> 03:08:48,003
LIAM: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?

2359
03:08:48,003 --> 03:08:52,733
TALIESIN: I know. (beatboxes)

2360
03:08:52,733 --> 03:09:00,684
MATT: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex,
you're up first.

2361
03:09:00,684 --> 03:09:09,106
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine
around here, so he can lash up and try to catch

2362
03:09:09,106 --> 03:09:11,850
that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.

2363
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:13,451
MATT: What's he have to roll for that?

2364
03:09:13,451 --> 03:09:18,091
LAURA: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.

2365
03:09:18,091 --> 03:09:21,249
MARISHA: Get it! Get it, son!

2366
03:09:21,249 --> 03:09:29,753
MATT: That's an eight. He is running up the
stairs.

2367
03:09:29,753 --> 03:09:31,486
LAURA: So it snatches his ankle.

2368
03:09:31,486 --> 03:09:32,818
MATT: And then drags him.

2369
03:09:32,818 --> 03:09:38,763
LAURA: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him
twice.

2370
03:09:38,763 --> 03:09:40,944
MATT: All right. Go for it.

2371
03:09:40,944 --> 03:09:43,901
TALIESIN: Not that one. That one looks like he
knows too much.

2372
03:09:43,901 --> 03:09:47,300
LAURA: What is that? 32.

2373
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:51,900
MATT: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2374
03:09:51,900 --> 03:10:01,283
LAURA: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get
sneak attack on this guy, though?

2375
03:10:01,283 --> 03:10:02,614
MATT: No.

2376
03:10:02,614 --> 03:10:11,033
LAURA: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and
then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a

2377
03:10:11,033 --> 03:10:15,535
32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28

2378
03:10:15,535 --> 03:10:22,864
MATT: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog,
you're up next. You're in the back of the marching

2379
03:10:22,864 --> 03:10:24,204
order.

2380
03:10:24,204 --> 03:10:25,960
TRAVIS: We're not up at the top, are we?

2381
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:31,621
MATT: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet
before you can get to the top there.

2382
03:10:31,621 --> 03:10:33,680
LAURA: 12, plus six lightning damage.

2383
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:41,264
MATT: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one
round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through

2384
03:10:41,264 --> 03:10:44,247
the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is
currently wrapped around him.

2385
03:10:44,247 --> 03:10:49,574
LAURA: I am going to use my movement to stand
behind this little pillar right here.

2386
03:10:49,574 --> 03:10:51,999
MATT: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.

2387
03:10:51,999 --> 03:10:59,936
TRAVIS: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice
tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash

2388
03:10:59,936 --> 03:11:04,316
up past my mates and into the fray?

2389
03:11:04,316 --> 03:11:11,801
MATT: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at
the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet

2390
03:11:11,801 --> 03:11:12,897
you can go.

2391
03:11:12,897 --> 03:11:14,198
TRAVIS: Yeah, straight towards them.

2392
03:11:14,198 --> 03:11:15,518
MATT: All right, so that's there.

2393
03:11:15,518 --> 03:11:18,654
TRAVIS: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the
way?

2394
03:11:18,654 --> 03:11:20,653
MATT: To close the gap there? Sure.

2395
03:11:20,653 --> 03:11:26,202
TRAVIS: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so
can I go into a rage?

2396
03:11:26,202 --> 03:11:30,379
MATT: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point
you go into a rage.

2397
03:11:30,379 --> 03:11:31,702
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

2398
03:11:31,702 --> 03:11:42,841
MATT: All righty, so now it is his turn.

2399
03:11:42,841 --> 03:11:50,605
MARISHA: You have that guy? But this guy was the
runner, I thought.

2400
03:11:50,605 --> 03:11:52,766
TALIESIN: Yeah, but he's vined.

2401
03:11:52,766 --> 03:11:55,836
MARISHA: Okay. He's currently grasped.

2402
03:11:55,836 --> 03:12:04,253
MATT: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face,
you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at

2403
03:12:04,253 --> 03:12:13,674
this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older,
late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye,

2404
03:12:13,674 --> 03:12:19,377
but in that socket you can see a faint spark of
arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space,

2405
03:12:19,377 --> 03:12:28,308
"Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and
devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you

2406
03:12:28,308 --> 03:12:37,623
rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in
the space between there.

2407
03:12:37,623 --> 03:12:41,288
MARISHA: Between him and Grog?

2408
03:12:41,288 --> 03:12:44,959
LAURA: (singing) The space between.

2409
03:12:44,959 --> 03:12:49,185
SAM: (singing) Your wicked lies.

2410
03:12:49,185 --> 03:12:55,690
MATT: It pushes you back five feet, and now there
is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of

2411
03:12:55,690 --> 03:12:57,684
the hallway from where he is.

2412
03:12:57,684 --> 03:13:02,350
MARISHA: Him and the other guy? Or just between
him? How big is it?

2413
03:13:02,350 --> 03:13:08,737
MATT: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the
Wall of Force.

2414
03:13:08,737 --> 03:13:11,206
MARISHA: Fucking fuckface.

2415
03:13:11,206 --> 03:13:18,628
TRAVIS: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk
through that shit?

2416
03:13:18,628 --> 03:13:20,464
MARISHA: Yeah, it just might hurt.

2417
03:13:20,464 --> 03:13:22,272
TRAVIS: Will it?

2418
03:13:22,272 --> 03:13:28,348
MATT: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a
slight short barrier that forces you back about

2419
03:13:28,348 --> 03:13:32,953
five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as
the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible.

2420
03:13:32,953 --> 03:13:39,914
Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning
from there. He glances over to the right into the

2421
03:13:39,914 --> 03:13:42,888
hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.

2422
03:13:42,888 --> 03:13:44,907
TRAVIS: Which was that way, right?

2423
03:13:44,907 --> 03:13:52,385
MATT: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring
me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the

2424
03:13:52,385 --> 03:14:00,819
faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That
ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a

2425
03:14:00,819 --> 03:14:06,200
step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan,
you're up.

2426
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:09,391
SAM: I'm up? What can I do?

2427
03:14:09,391 --> 03:14:11,744
MATT: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.

2428
03:14:11,744 --> 03:14:13,741
SAM: My speed is 25.

2429
03:14:13,741 --> 03:14:17,116
MATT: That'll get you right up to about there,
with five-foot steps.

2430
03:14:17,116 --> 03:14:18,819
MARISHA: Don't let them leave!

2431
03:14:18,819 --> 03:14:21,732
SAM: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.

2432
03:14:21,732 --> 03:14:27,910
TRAVIS: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.

2433
03:14:27,910 --> 03:14:37,163
SAM: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall
of Force?

2434
03:14:37,163 --> 03:14:40,056
MATT: You don't. You actually rush up, and it
looks like it's an open hallway right now.

2435
03:14:40,056 --> 03:14:51,011
SAM: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see
these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt

2436
03:14:51,011 --> 03:14:53,505
at somebody.

2437
03:14:53,505 --> 03:14:54,961
MATT: Which one?

2438
03:14:54,961 --> 03:15:00,367
SAM: Looks like I can't see this guy because there
is a pillar in between, so the other guy.

2439
03:15:00,367 --> 03:15:03,952
MATT: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All
right. You'll have to move off to the side, or

2440
03:15:03,952 --> 03:15:08,147
else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning
Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps,

2441
03:15:08,147 --> 03:15:13,083
though. You could probably aim it above and hit
him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get

2442
03:15:13,083 --> 03:15:16,814
to the top, you release your bolt of lightning.
(crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets

2443
03:15:16,814 --> 03:15:20,916
right above Grog, it hits something solid and
splinters. No effect.

2444
03:15:20,916 --> 03:15:24,653
LIAM: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to
ceiling?

2445
03:15:24,653 --> 03:15:30,285
MATT: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a
faint shimmer because something pushed him out of

2446
03:15:30,285 --> 03:15:35,169
this space, but right now you have no visual
perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I

2447
03:15:35,169 --> 03:15:42,691
believe. All right. The other guy, who is
currently held by the vine that falls limp off of

2448
03:15:42,691 --> 03:15:43,865
his body--

2449
03:15:43,865 --> 03:15:45,534
LAURA: It falls limp off of his body?

2450
03:15:45,534 --> 03:15:50,071
MATT: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him
held. Every turn, it can pull something towards

2451
03:15:50,071 --> 03:15:58,352
it. He's going to glance over towards the side,
listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay.

2452
03:15:58,352 --> 03:16:07,210
At which point, that humming gets louder and
louder.

2453
03:16:07,210 --> 03:16:18,262
TALIESIN: He had the map. If he built the map,
there's a way out.

2454
03:16:18,262 --> 03:16:27,097
MATT: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of
void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone

2455
03:16:27,097 --> 03:16:33,471
wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving
a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape

2456
03:16:33,471 --> 03:16:38,356
of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into
your space.

2457
03:16:38,356 --> 03:16:43,038
TRAVIS: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.

2458
03:16:43,038 --> 03:16:44,394
LIAM: Yes, it is.

2459
03:16:44,394 --> 03:16:45,451
TALIESIN: Oh shit, son!

2460
03:16:45,451 --> 03:16:46,702
LAURA: Oh god!

2461
03:16:46,702 --> 03:16:49,990
SAM: Is someone controlling it?

2462
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:54,161
MATT: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw.

2463
03:16:54,161 --> 03:16:57,024
LAURA: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get
advantage?

2464
03:16:57,024 --> 03:17:03,316
TRAVIS: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you
up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.

2465
03:17:03,316 --> 03:17:09,668
SAM: I see this happening, right?

2466
03:17:09,668 --> 03:17:11,280
TRAVIS: 16.

2467
03:17:11,280 --> 03:17:17,737
MATT: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way
as it enters the space, and you can feel this

2468
03:17:17,737 --> 03:17:26,161
weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled
toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum

2469
03:17:26,161 --> 03:17:29,263
before you. It's like staring into an absolute
nothingness.

2470
03:17:29,263 --> 03:17:31,171
TRAVIS: Take my life, but not my beard.

2471
03:17:31,171 --> 03:17:34,505
MARISHA: Who looks like he's controlling it?
Odell?

2472
03:17:34,505 --> 03:17:38,017
MATT: The guy who is being pulled by her is
concentrating and moving it over, at that point.

2473
03:17:38,017 --> 03:17:40,780
LAURA: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is
controlling it!

2474
03:17:40,780 --> 03:17:43,204
MATT: All right. That's going to end his turn.
Keyleth, you're up.

2475
03:17:43,204 --> 03:17:44,860
MARISHA: (yells)

2476
03:17:44,860 --> 03:17:50,727
MATT: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling
enemies hurt. It's okay.

2477
03:17:50,727 --> 03:17:53,315
SAM: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.

2478
03:17:53,315 --> 03:17:56,212
MATT: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your
turn.

2479
03:17:56,212 --> 03:18:01,296
MARISHA: Oh my god. So much has changed from what
I thought I was going to do.

2480
03:18:01,296 --> 03:18:03,419
MATT: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.

2481
03:18:03,419 --> 03:18:09,295
MARISHA: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.

2482
03:18:09,295 --> 03:18:14,051
MATT: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there,
where the staircase stops.

2483
03:18:14,051 --> 03:18:19,215
TRAVIS: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an
attack of opportunity if I run away?

2484
03:18:19,215 --> 03:18:22,008
TALIESIN: Probably not.

2485
03:18:22,008 --> 03:18:26,234
SAM: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?

2486
03:18:26,234 --> 03:18:35,161
MATT: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys
is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it

2487
03:18:35,161 --> 03:18:37,878
moved under his willpower in the direction of
Grog.

2488
03:18:37,878 --> 03:18:40,258
TRAVIS: It's real bad.

2489
03:18:40,258 --> 03:18:52,206
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to
think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified.

2490
03:18:52,206 --> 03:18:57,863
And I'm going to stick with my original instinct
and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys

2491
03:18:57,863 --> 03:19:10,123
in so they can't run. I think they can still carve
through it with their big black death orb now.

2492
03:19:10,123 --> 03:19:11,896
TRAVIS: They can, but at least they'll be here.

2493
03:19:11,896 --> 03:19:13,769
TALIESIN: They'll have to move the orb to do
that.

2494
03:19:13,769 --> 03:19:27,489
MARISHA: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot
panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off,

2495
03:19:27,558 --> 03:19:31,620
bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.

2496
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:35,035
MATT: Okay. Hold on a second.

2497
03:19:35,035 --> 03:19:42,810
TRAVIS: Who can get to the other side? You have
Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the

2498
03:19:42,810 --> 03:19:45,793
only person that has that kind of a thing.

2499
03:19:45,793 --> 03:19:53,061
MATT: As you attempt to concentrate and create a
Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or

2500
03:19:53,061 --> 03:19:55,337
an area beyond the barrier.

2501
03:19:55,337 --> 03:19:58,707
TRAVIS: The Wall of Force? No!

2502
03:19:58,707 --> 03:20:00,378
LAURA: Say it again?

2503
03:20:00,378 --> 03:20:03,587
TRAVIS: And you need to focus, or is it a random?

2504
03:20:03,587 --> 03:20:14,145
MATT: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no
area to release it on. The barrier, while

2505
03:20:14,145 --> 03:20:18,000
invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area
to create.

2506
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,957
TALIESIN: We need to dispel this shit.

2507
03:20:19,957 --> 03:20:24,453
MARISHA: I do have Dispel Magic.

2508
03:20:24,453 --> 03:20:29,940
MATT: You've used your action to attempt it. You
didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your

2509
03:20:29,940 --> 03:20:31,350
action attempting it.

2510
03:20:31,350 --> 03:20:35,239
TRAVIS: Hey, man. That was a nice try.

2511
03:20:35,239 --> 03:20:37,749
MARISHA: Can't cast through it.

2512
03:20:37,749 --> 03:20:42,702
LAURA: Good to know. But the orb went through it?

2513
03:20:42,702 --> 03:20:45,262
MATT: No, the orb is on the other side.

2514
03:20:45,262 --> 03:20:53,924
MARISHA: Even though it's a nature thing, going up
underneath there, I can't get around it? No?

2515
03:20:53,924 --> 03:20:59,866
MATT: You're targeting on the other side of the
wall. It has to be in visual range for you to

2516
03:20:59,866 --> 03:21:01,397
create it to happen.

2517
03:21:01,397 --> 03:21:03,501
MARISHA: (singing) I'll see you on the other side
of the wall.

2518
03:21:03,501 --> 03:21:06,603
(laughter)

2519
03:21:06,603 --> 03:21:12,929
MATT: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry.
At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this

2520
03:21:12,929 --> 03:21:19,789
(breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures
emerge from the nearby walls.

2521
03:21:19,789 --> 03:21:24,362
LIAM: Ghosts! Shadows!

2522
03:21:24,362 --> 03:21:26,261
TRAVIS: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?

2523
03:21:26,261 --> 03:21:27,749
MARISHA: Wraiths.

2524
03:21:27,749 --> 03:21:30,102
LIAM: There's ten different kinds of things like
that.

2525
03:21:30,102 --> 03:21:38,765
MARISHA: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you
up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?

2526
03:21:38,765 --> 03:21:42,775
TALIESIN: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!

2527
03:21:42,775 --> 03:21:48,502
MATT: This one hovers over and lands behind
Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to

2528
03:21:48,502 --> 03:21:49,962
shift through the pillar--

2529
03:21:49,962 --> 03:21:52,808
MARISHA: I look over my shoulder and go: Oh no!

2530
03:21:52,808 --> 03:21:57,500
MATT: This one here stays within the pillar, and
it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes

2531
03:21:57,500 --> 03:22:04,500
at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.

2532
03:22:04,500 --> 03:22:06,163
LAURA: That hits.

2533
03:22:06,163 --> 03:22:18,964
MATT: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic
damage, and I need you to succeed on a

2534
03:22:18,964 --> 03:22:20,696
constitution saving throw.

2535
03:22:20,696 --> 03:22:25,098
LIAM: Fuck! Come on.

2536
03:22:25,098 --> 03:22:28,807
TRAVIS: My fucking god!

2537
03:22:28,807 --> 03:22:32,591
SAM: It's a 20?

2538
03:22:32,591 --> 03:22:35,252
(screaming)

2539
03:22:35,252 --> 03:22:39,595
MATT: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of
necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are

2540
03:22:39,595 --> 03:22:41,357
reduced by 21.

2541
03:22:41,357 --> 03:22:42,953
LAURA: Forever?

2542
03:22:42,953 --> 03:22:52,683
MATT: Until you finish a long rest. The other
one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.

2543
03:22:52,683 --> 03:22:54,058
MARISHA: Misses!

2544
03:22:54,058 --> 03:22:56,021
MATT: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the
ring.

2545
03:22:56,021 --> 03:22:58,785
MARISHA: That's right! I leveled up,
motherfuckers!

2546
03:22:58,785 --> 03:23:05,868
MATT: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up
didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the

2547
03:23:05,868 --> 03:23:07,216
magic item did.

2548
03:23:07,216 --> 03:23:09,162
MARISHA: But I feated, so I'm good!

2549
03:23:09,162 --> 03:23:17,133
MATT: I know. So as it swings toward you, its
claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both

2550
03:23:17,133 --> 03:23:21,327
vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity?
You can if you'd like to.

2551
03:23:21,327 --> 03:23:22,882
MARISHA: War Caster?

2552
03:23:22,882 --> 03:23:26,233
MATT: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell
on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's

2553
03:23:26,233 --> 03:23:31,084
going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex,
you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd

2554
03:23:31,084 --> 03:23:34,081
like, with a melee weapon.

2555
03:23:34,081 --> 03:23:36,089
MARISHA: Does it have to be a bonus action?

2556
03:23:36,089 --> 03:23:42,575
MATT: No, it can be an action. That's part of the
War Caster feat.

2557
03:23:42,575 --> 03:23:49,871
LAURA: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it
drawn.

2558
03:23:49,871 --> 03:23:51,507
MATT: Then yeah, you're fine.

2559
03:23:51,507 --> 03:23:54,141
LIAM: They're both out of visual range, right?

2560
03:23:54,141 --> 03:23:55,786
MATT: They both are now backing up.

2561
03:23:55,786 --> 03:24:08,699
LIAM: One's in a pillar, and one went through a
wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?

2562
03:24:08,699 --> 03:24:10,751
MATT: You can't hear them.

2563
03:24:10,751 --> 03:24:13,467
LIAM: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't
hear them. All right. Thanks.

2564
03:24:13,467 --> 03:24:15,076
MATT: No worries.

2565
03:24:15,076 --> 03:24:17,995
LAURA: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by
the way.

2566
03:24:17,995 --> 03:24:22,961
MATT: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic
damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.

2567
03:24:22,961 --> 03:24:24,532
LAURA: Okay.

2568
03:24:24,532 --> 03:24:38,375
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what
would be a good idea right now.

2569
03:24:38,375 --> 03:24:40,362
TALIESIN: I have no ideas for anything.

2570
03:24:40,362 --> 03:24:49,991
MARISHA: I have never done this before, but I have
it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice

2571
03:24:49,991 --> 03:24:58,182
Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling
it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10

2572
03:24:58,182 --> 03:25:02,378
piercing damage, and then it explodes?

2573
03:25:02,378 --> 03:25:09,483
MATT: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the
feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction

2574
03:25:09,483 --> 03:25:14,987
when something comes at her. Just know that
whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So

2575
03:25:14,987 --> 03:25:17,990
if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might
come back and hit you.

2576
03:25:17,990 --> 03:25:22,372
MARISHA: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes,
the target and each creature within five feet of

2577
03:25:22,372 --> 03:25:28,027
the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine.
I'm doing it anyway.

2578
03:25:28,027 --> 03:25:30,674
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.

2579
03:25:30,674 --> 03:25:34,602
TRAVIS: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?

2580
03:25:34,602 --> 03:25:36,423
LAURA: No, he's behind her.

2581
03:25:36,423 --> 03:25:37,928
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck sake.

2582
03:25:37,928 --> 03:25:39,928
MARISHA: What's wrong with us?

2583
03:25:39,928 --> 03:25:42,516
LAURA: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.

2584
03:25:42,516 --> 03:25:44,535
MATT: Tonight is ridiculous.

2585
03:25:44,535 --> 03:25:46,132
MARISHA: One.

2586
03:25:46,132 --> 03:25:50,795
MATT: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife,
it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it

2587
03:25:50,795 --> 03:25:52,519
does still explode, right?

2588
03:25:52,519 --> 03:25:53,522
MARISHA: Yeah.

2589
03:25:53,522 --> 03:25:54,884
MATT: So it does what damage?

2590
03:25:54,884 --> 03:25:55,944
MARISHA: 2d6.

2591
03:25:55,944 --> 03:25:59,340
MATT: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To
both you and the creature?

2592
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:03,233
TALIESIN: Yeah, all creatures within range.

2593
03:26:03,233 --> 03:26:16,667
MARISHA: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four,
five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or

2594
03:26:16,667 --> 03:26:18,526
miss, the shard then explodes.

2595
03:26:18,526 --> 03:26:22,062
MATT: All right, so you take seven points of ice
damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold

2596
03:26:22,062 --> 03:26:24,715
damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect
as you would expect.

2597
03:26:24,715 --> 03:26:27,240
LAURA: It's a fucking wraith!

2598
03:26:27,240 --> 03:26:29,899
MATT: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.

2599
03:26:29,899 --> 03:26:36,224
TALIESIN: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so
I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and

2600
03:26:36,224 --> 03:26:37,809
see what the fuck is going on.

2601
03:26:37,809 --> 03:26:43,485
MATT: All right. You glance up and get just beyond
where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more

2602
03:26:43,485 --> 03:26:45,533
feet you can move if you want.

2603
03:26:45,533 --> 03:26:50,610
TALIESIN: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a
look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at

2604
03:26:50,610 --> 03:26:53,798
the guy I see up on the table there.

2605
03:26:53,798 --> 03:26:55,913
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2606
03:26:55,913 --> 03:26:57,871
TALIESIN: That's better.

2607
03:26:57,871 --> 03:26:59,151
MATT: Which guy?

2608
03:26:59,151 --> 03:27:03,620
TALIESIN: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?

2609
03:27:03,620 --> 03:27:07,914
MATT: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as
it detonates against some sort of invisible wall

2610
03:27:07,914 --> 03:27:12,610
that you didn't see was there before, scattering
helplessly against the space in the air.

2611
03:27:12,610 --> 03:27:14,534
MARISHA: I hate this force field shit.

2612
03:27:14,534 --> 03:27:18,925
TRAVIS: It explodes near my head, and I'm like:
Stop shooting into this thing!

2613
03:27:18,925 --> 03:27:22,950
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop back down the hall.

2614
03:27:22,950 --> 03:27:31,668
MATT: All right, you get right back down to right
there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.

2615
03:27:31,668 --> 03:27:39,443
LIAM: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to
dance through to here, where I can see Grog and

2616
03:27:39,443 --> 03:27:45,181
these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and
I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who

2617
03:27:45,181 --> 03:27:48,950
comes right up to one of my friends within
striking range.

2618
03:27:48,950 --> 03:27:53,224
MATT: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's
turn, Pike's up.

2619
03:27:53,224 --> 03:27:56,136
LAURA: Pike comes running up the steps.

2620
03:27:56,136 --> 03:28:03,524
MATT: She can get right up to here, and that's as
much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if

2621
03:28:03,524 --> 03:28:12,306
she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope
for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.

2622
03:28:12,306 --> 03:28:14,804
MATT: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.

2623
03:28:14,804 --> 03:28:16,317
LAURA: Sorry, Grog.

2624
03:28:16,317 --> 03:28:17,593
TRAVIS: That's my fault.

2625
03:28:17,593 --> 03:28:23,136
LAURA: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom
saving throws and death saving throws, and any

2626
03:28:23,136 --> 03:28:26,522
time you're healed, you regain the maximum number
of hit points.

2627
03:28:26,522 --> 03:28:28,677
SAM: Even if we move out of the radius?

2628
03:28:28,677 --> 03:28:31,926
MATT: It affects everybody at that moment, and
then you carry it with you.

2629
03:28:31,926 --> 03:28:33,922
LAURA: Wisdom and death saving throws.

2630
03:28:33,922 --> 03:28:36,194
LIAM: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.

2631
03:28:36,194 --> 03:28:37,839
MARISHA: Wisdom and death plus what?

2632
03:28:37,839 --> 03:28:40,696
LAURA: And full hit points when you get healed.

2633
03:28:40,696 --> 03:28:42,972
TALIESIN: You don't roll; you get the max.

2634
03:28:42,972 --> 03:28:44,809
MARISHA: Beautiful.

2635
03:28:44,809 --> 03:28:52,819
MATT: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the
top. Vex, your turn.

2636
03:28:52,819 --> 03:29:04,662
LAURA: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things
explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my

2637
03:29:04,662 --> 03:29:09,973
Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and
put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere

2638
03:29:09,973 --> 03:29:11,972
is out and I don't know if it matters.

2639
03:29:11,972 --> 03:29:13,780
MATT: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your
neck.

2640
03:29:13,780 --> 03:29:21,795
LAURA: Do I still have control of the vine?

2641
03:29:21,795 --> 03:29:23,626
MATT: Currently, yeah.

2642
03:29:23,626 --> 03:29:25,593
LAURA: Okay. And it's on the other side of the
force?

2643
03:29:25,593 --> 03:29:26,949
MATT: This is true.

2644
03:29:26,949 --> 03:29:36,385
LAURA: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try
to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is

2645
03:29:36,385 --> 03:29:42,467
holding the force wall, right? But it probably is
a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.

2646
03:29:42,467 --> 03:29:43,789
MATT: Correct.

2647
03:29:43,789 --> 03:29:48,032
LAURA: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm
going to try to knock him down and see if I can

2648
03:29:48,032 --> 03:29:50,981
break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that
stupid?

2649
03:29:50,981 --> 03:29:57,218
MATT: He does not make his save. He isn't moved.
It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the

2650
03:29:57,218 --> 03:30:02,615
area where it is again, but it's barely shifted
him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't

2651
03:30:02,615 --> 03:30:04,209
seem to affect him at all.

2652
03:30:04,209 --> 03:30:06,358
LAURA: That's a bonus action. I still get an
action.

2653
03:30:06,358 --> 03:30:07,607
MATT: Yep, and movement.

2654
03:30:07,607 --> 03:30:21,368
LAURA: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread
out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here.

2655
03:30:21,368 --> 03:30:33,181
Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm
going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I

2656
03:30:33,181 --> 03:30:35,932
see something getting through that fucking force
wall.

2657
03:30:35,932 --> 03:30:37,652
TALIESIN: Until there's something to hit.

2658
03:30:37,652 --> 03:30:39,754
LAURA: So that I can attack him.

2659
03:30:39,754 --> 03:30:42,355
MATT: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end
of your turn. Grog, you're up.

2660
03:30:42,355 --> 03:30:48,551
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and run through the Wall
of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and

2661
03:30:48,551 --> 03:30:50,075
we'll see what happens.

2662
03:30:50,075 --> 03:30:56,743
MATT: All right, you slam face-first into a stone
wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you,

2663
03:30:56,743 --> 03:31:01,791
the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as
you seem to have busted some element of your nose

2664
03:31:01,791 --> 03:31:03,263
in the impact.

2665
03:31:03,263 --> 03:31:08,029
TRAVIS: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere?
Not even an inch?

2666
03:31:08,029 --> 03:31:09,607
MATT: No.

2667
03:31:09,607 --> 03:31:15,903
TRAVIS: What if I channel all the rage from my
life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm

2668
03:31:15,903 --> 03:31:18,961
going to turn around and run the other way.

2669
03:31:18,961 --> 03:31:20,467
MARISHA: You didn't get through?

2670
03:31:20,467 --> 03:31:34,439
TRAVIS: No, it didn't even give, apparently.
(counting) 50, right there.

2671
03:31:34,439 --> 03:31:37,149
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?

2672
03:31:37,149 --> 03:31:44,839
TRAVIS: Yeah, that ends my turn.

2673
03:31:44,839 --> 03:31:51,936
MATT: This guy turns around and begins to make his
way up the stairs and move double dash, and

2674
03:31:51,936 --> 03:31:53,472
disappears up the stairs.

2675
03:31:53,472 --> 03:31:55,017
MARISHA: (screams in frustration)

2676
03:31:55,017 --> 03:32:01,257
TRAVIS: We can't do anything. Nobody knows
Disintegrate or anything?

2677
03:32:01,257 --> 03:32:03,979
MARISHA: Whose turn is it?

2678
03:32:03,979 --> 03:32:06,836
MATT: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now
Scanlan's turn.

2679
03:32:06,836 --> 03:32:14,705
SAM: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will
inspire Grog, I guess.

2680
03:32:14,705 --> 03:32:16,407
TRAVIS: Or yourself.

2681
03:32:16,407 --> 03:32:19,482
SAM: I'm okay.

2682
03:32:19,482 --> 03:32:21,201
TRAVIS: Really? Okay.

2683
03:32:21,201 --> 03:32:35,247
SAM: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with
that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I

2684
03:32:35,247 --> 03:32:46,716
really hate that big black ball, all it better do
is miss you, make it miss you.

2685
03:32:46,716 --> 03:32:53,041
MATT: Oh my god, that was not my intent in
creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.

2686
03:32:53,041 --> 03:32:54,264
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2687
03:32:54,264 --> 03:33:00,212
SAM: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go
through the Wall of Force. We've tried this

2688
03:33:00,212 --> 03:33:04,030
before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?

2689
03:33:04,030 --> 03:33:07,495
TRAVIS: And the previous ruling was it worked.

2690
03:33:07,495 --> 03:33:11,292
SAM: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.

2691
03:33:11,292 --> 03:33:12,888
MATT: The wording is important on this.

2692
03:33:12,888 --> 03:33:18,322
LIAM: I think the cultist shits his pants and his
brain explodes. I think that's in the book.

2693
03:33:18,322 --> 03:33:28,914
MATT: I've had to look this up very carefully.
With elements like this wall, it's a targeting

2694
03:33:28,914 --> 03:33:35,226
thing. You cannot target something that is in full
cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is.

2695
03:33:35,226 --> 03:33:39,951
Teleportation, however, you're the target and
Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.

2696
03:33:39,951 --> 03:33:43,699
SAM: Matt fucking hates this.

2697
03:33:43,699 --> 03:33:46,326
MARISHA: Get the runner!

2698
03:33:46,326 --> 03:33:50,300
SAM: I don't know where the runner went.

2699
03:33:50,300 --> 03:33:52,067
MARISHA: He went that way.

2700
03:33:52,067 --> 03:33:53,636
SAM: I don't see him, right?

2701
03:33:53,636 --> 03:33:56,532
MATT: You saw him run away, you just don't know
where he is at the moment.

2702
03:33:56,532 --> 03:34:03,520
SAM: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that
hall? Do I see down the hall?

2703
03:34:03,520 --> 03:34:06,960
MATT: Not from where you were over there.

2704
03:34:06,960 --> 03:34:09,051
SAM: So I'm going next to the red guy.

2705
03:34:09,051 --> 03:34:12,170
LIAM: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna
knows all.

2706
03:34:12,170 --> 03:34:14,231
LAURA: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.

2707
03:34:14,231 --> 03:34:17,842
MATT: All right, so you Dimension Door there.
That's your action.

2708
03:34:17,842 --> 03:34:19,260
SAM: That's my everything.

2709
03:34:19,260 --> 03:34:21,189
MARISHA: We've got to take out these guys'
eyeballs.

2710
03:34:21,189 --> 03:34:31,109
MATT: That's the end of your turn. At which point,
Odell, who's standing there currently, is

2711
03:34:31,109 --> 03:34:37,513
physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere
right now. Looks over and sees you appear and

2712
03:34:37,513 --> 03:34:43,871
goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"

2713
03:34:43,871 --> 03:34:46,252
SAM: Who are you calling little?

2714
03:34:46,252 --> 03:34:52,246
MATT: At which point, you glance over your
shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked

2715
03:34:52,246 --> 03:34:57,725
one stops and spins and faces towards you.

2716
03:34:57,725 --> 03:34:59,620
SAM: That's not good for me, guys.

2717
03:34:59,620 --> 03:35:04,924
MARISHA: It's not good for you, but it's good for
us. Fuck them up!

2718
03:35:04,924 --> 03:35:07,488
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2719
03:35:07,488 --> 03:35:16,012
MATT: That's as far as they can get. However, it
completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is

2720
03:35:16,012 --> 03:35:20,690
obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a
bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes

2721
03:35:20,690 --> 03:35:26,768
through, about a good six inches around it is
turned to dust and is gone.

2722
03:35:26,768 --> 03:35:29,921
LAURA: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?

2723
03:35:29,921 --> 03:35:33,865
MATT: He's then going to go back around--

2724
03:35:33,865 --> 03:35:36,627
TALIESIN and LIAM: No, he's grappled.

2725
03:35:36,627 --> 03:35:38,636
MATT: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things
toward it.

2726
03:35:38,636 --> 03:35:43,483
MARISHA: You're confusing Entanglement with
Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.

2727
03:35:43,483 --> 03:35:49,340
MATT: He's backing up, and he's looking over at
the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the

2728
03:35:49,340 --> 03:35:53,731
beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's
glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the

2729
03:35:53,731 --> 03:36:00,142
idea that his friend is returning. That's going to
end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2730
03:36:00,142 --> 03:36:16,825
MARISHA: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh,
fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force

2731
03:36:16,825 --> 03:36:37,226
Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this?
Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to

2732
03:36:37,226 --> 03:36:38,863
Dispel Magic this wall.

2733
03:36:38,863 --> 03:36:44,848
MATT: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you
release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst

2734
03:36:44,848 --> 03:36:51,385
of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly
against the exterior.

2735
03:36:51,385 --> 03:36:53,415
LAURA and LIAM: It's a higher level.

2736
03:36:53,415 --> 03:36:56,356
MARISHA: Higher than sixth level? The spell.

2737
03:36:56,356 --> 03:36:58,262
MATT: Didn't appear to have an effect on the
wall.

2738
03:36:58,262 --> 03:37:00,698
TRAVIS: Come on, maybe it needed to be something
else.

2739
03:37:00,698 --> 03:37:03,984
LIAM: No. He did what Scanlan does with
Counterspell. He beefed it up.

2740
03:37:03,984 --> 03:37:06,176
MARISHA: Okay.

2741
03:37:06,176 --> 03:37:15,099
MATT: You can move.

2742
03:37:15,099 --> 03:37:19,616
MARISHA: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have
to roll?

2743
03:37:19,616 --> 03:37:21,391
MATT: No effect on it.

2744
03:37:21,391 --> 03:37:25,226
TALIESIN: Okay, it's going to be okay.
Everything's okay.

2745
03:37:25,226 --> 03:37:27,635
LIAM: So about that long rest...

2746
03:37:27,635 --> 03:37:33,318
MARISHA: I don't know now, you guys.

2747
03:37:33,318 --> 03:37:35,197
LAURA: We're fucked.

2748
03:37:35,197 --> 03:37:42,673
MARISHA: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to
move that far forward. No, I don't move that far

2749
03:37:42,673 --> 03:37:44,946
forward!

2750
03:37:44,946 --> 03:37:47,300
(laughter)

2751
03:37:47,300 --> 03:37:49,117
MARISHA: I don't want to die!

2752
03:37:49,117 --> 03:37:51,706
MATT: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?

2753
03:37:51,706 --> 03:37:53,257
LIAM: (singing) I want you to be alive.

2754
03:37:53,257 --> 03:37:56,756
LIAM and MARISHA: (singing) I want you to be
alive.

2755
03:37:56,756 --> 03:38:00,453
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh no, here they come.

2756
03:38:00,453 --> 03:38:03,828
MATT: They take minor damage being in the physical
wall, but that's fine with them.

2757
03:38:03,828 --> 03:38:08,965
LIAM: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.

2758
03:38:08,965 --> 03:38:12,286
MATT: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth.
Go for it.

2759
03:38:12,383 --> 03:38:17,966
LAURA: What was I holding for? I was holding until
I could attack something, or until I could get

2760
03:38:17,966 --> 03:38:20,995
through the wall? I think it was through the
wall.

2761
03:38:20,995 --> 03:38:22,341
MATT: The wall.

2762
03:38:22,341 --> 03:38:24,197
LIAM: All right, 27 on that guy.

2763
03:38:24,197 --> 03:38:25,623
MATT: That hits.

2764
03:38:25,623 --> 03:38:35,640
LIAM: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six,
so ten. (counting)

2765
03:38:35,640 --> 03:38:40,032
TALIESIN: If we can hit them, they're probably
squishy.

2766
03:38:40,032 --> 03:38:46,238
MATT: You took out one of three between just two
of your surprise attacks.

2767
03:38:46,238 --> 03:38:52,249
LIAM: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second
paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.

2768
03:38:52,249 --> 03:38:53,718
MATT: Go for it.

2769
03:38:53,718 --> 03:38:59,406
LIAM: That is eight for the second.

2770
03:38:59,406 --> 03:39:08,341
MATT: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened
shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark

2771
03:39:08,341 --> 03:39:14,714
black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to
strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two

2772
03:39:14,714 --> 03:39:19,830
daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It
gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its

2773
03:39:19,830 --> 03:39:27,032
beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain,
and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form

2774
03:39:27,032 --> 03:39:30,427
somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a
corporeal form.

2775
03:39:30,427 --> 03:39:34,684
LIAM: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.

2776
03:39:34,684 --> 03:39:41,530
MATT: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking
against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?

2777
03:39:41,530 --> 03:39:42,835
LAURA: 23!

2778
03:39:42,835 --> 03:39:47,793
MATT: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she
manages to take the shield and bash it away. The

2779
03:39:47,793 --> 03:39:52,493
light from her mace arcing around causes it to
flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide.

2780
03:39:52,493 --> 03:40:03,059
The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that
is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six

2781
03:40:03,059 --> 03:40:11,891
to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second
time. It's then going to move back into the wall

2782
03:40:11,891 --> 03:40:16,803
over here. He's going to move back into the wall,
as well. Both of you get reactions.

2783
03:40:16,803 --> 03:40:23,037
LAURA: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of
Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.

2784
03:40:23,037 --> 03:40:26,944
MATT: All right, so roll an attack on that one.

2785
03:40:26,944 --> 03:40:32,450
LAURA: That's a 21 to hit.

2786
03:40:32,450 --> 03:40:36,183
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2787
03:40:36,183 --> 03:40:42,376
TRAVIS: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm
running from an 8-ball.

2788
03:40:42,376 --> 03:40:48,105
TALIESIN: We've got to get everyone away from that
thing.

2789
03:40:48,105 --> 03:40:55,726
LAURA: 27 for Pike.

2790
03:40:55,726 --> 03:40:57,833
MATT: 27 points of damage?

2791
03:40:57,833 --> 03:41:04,617
LAURA: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to
have a wisdom save of 15.

2792
03:41:04,617 --> 03:41:08,165
MATT: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after
taking the damage, which it does not. That one

2793
03:41:08,165 --> 03:41:14,334
has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it
did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as

2794
03:41:14,334 --> 03:41:19,031
she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where
the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate

2795
03:41:19,031 --> 03:41:23,519
part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it
disappears into the wall.

2796
03:41:23,519 --> 03:41:26,137
LIAM: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as
well, right?

2797
03:41:26,137 --> 03:41:27,833
MATT: No, the one that you hit is where she was.

2798
03:41:27,833 --> 03:41:29,212
LIAM: Oh, Pike hit the other one.

2799
03:41:29,212 --> 03:41:34,269
MATT: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing
anything as a reaction?

2800
03:41:34,269 --> 03:41:42,943
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and
do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.

2801
03:41:42,943 --> 03:41:48,185
MATT: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.

2802
03:41:48,185 --> 03:41:50,795
MARISHA: Half damage.

2803
03:41:50,795 --> 03:41:57,858
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the
four.

2804
03:41:57,858 --> 03:41:59,540
TALIESIN: And then there was a third one.

2805
03:41:59,540 --> 03:42:09,508
MARISHA: And then there's a third one that is a
six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.

2806
03:42:09,508 --> 03:42:13,392
MATT: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half
which is eight, and even that impact seems to be

2807
03:42:13,392 --> 03:42:18,704
lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly
absorbing some of the heat from the impact.

2808
03:42:18,704 --> 03:42:21,067
LAURA: Radiant damage is the bomb!

2809
03:42:21,067 --> 03:42:22,857
TALIESIN: Radiant damage is what we need in here.

2810
03:42:22,857 --> 03:42:26,810
MATT: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy,
you're up.

2811
03:42:26,810 --> 03:42:35,430
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay in my little cubby
hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of

2812
03:42:35,430 --> 03:42:40,888
these guys down here. I'm going to yell at
everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm

2813
03:42:40,888 --> 03:42:47,347
going to hold my attack until something happens
that's going to give me something to shoot at.

2814
03:42:47,347 --> 03:42:53,771
MATT: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself
that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn.

2815
03:42:53,771 --> 03:42:55,003
Vax, you're up.

2816
03:42:55,003 --> 03:43:00,399
LIAM: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing
except I'm going to move to here and wait for

2817
03:43:00,399 --> 03:43:02,833
something to attack one of my friends.

2818
03:43:02,833 --> 03:43:04,560
TALIESIN: That's awfully close to the ball.

2819
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:10,716
LIAM: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting
until one of them attacks one of my friends. One

2820
03:43:10,716 --> 03:43:15,706
of the undead. I can't do anything about that.
That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.

2821
03:43:15,706 --> 03:43:17,513
MATT: All right, Pike's turn.

2822
03:43:17,513 --> 03:43:21,014
LIAM: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.

2823
03:43:21,014 --> 03:43:28,018
LAURA: I can only do this as a bonus action so
that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's

2824
03:43:28,018 --> 03:43:36,786
going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it
at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast

2825
03:43:36,786 --> 03:43:51,431
Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword
that looks like it's on fire.

2826
03:43:51,431 --> 03:43:53,006
MATT: Whereabouts? On the wall here?

2827
03:43:53,006 --> 03:43:58,175
LAURA: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the
wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing

2828
03:43:58,175 --> 03:44:07,017
is down. And then she's going to hold her physical
action until there's something that she can attack.

2829
03:44:07,017 --> 03:44:09,240
MATT: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?

2830
03:44:09,240 --> 03:44:11,276
LAURA: Yeah, her mace.

2831
03:44:11,276 --> 03:44:13,410
MATT: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.

2832
03:44:13,410 --> 03:44:15,925
LAURA: Oh, that's me!

2833
03:44:15,925 --> 03:44:18,154
MATT: Yeah, that's you, actually.

2834
03:44:18,154 --> 03:44:19,846
LIAM: You're Vex.

2835
03:44:19,846 --> 03:44:29,748
LAURA: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this
ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.

2836
03:44:29,748 --> 03:44:31,598
SAM: Hey, you broke through!

2837
03:44:31,598 --> 03:44:35,940
LAURA: I broke through the wall. I can't reach.
I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.

2838
03:44:35,940 --> 03:44:38,408
SAM: Make Matt stand up, Laura.

2839
03:44:38,408 --> 03:44:40,416
MATT: Please do. I appreciate it.

2840
03:44:40,416 --> 03:44:50,945
LAURA: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack
until something comes out that I can attack.

2841
03:44:50,945 --> 03:44:53,495
MATT: Okay. All righty.

2842
03:44:53,495 --> 03:44:55,634
MARISHA: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel
that wall.

2843
03:44:55,634 --> 03:44:57,326
MATT: Grog, you're up.

2844
03:44:57,326 --> 03:45:01,990
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.

2845
03:45:01,990 --> 03:45:10,188
LAURA: Wait, I have bonus action still.

2846
03:45:10,188 --> 03:45:11,589
MATT: You do.

2847
03:45:11,589 --> 03:45:16,578
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine
that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab

2848
03:45:16,578 --> 03:45:21,117
onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him
towards the wall he's right in front of.

2849
03:45:21,117 --> 03:45:24,207
MATT: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?

2850
03:45:24,207 --> 03:45:25,289
LAURA: 15.

2851
03:45:25,289 --> 03:45:34,038
MATT: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out
towards him and this time-- I forget the adage,

2852
03:45:34,038 --> 03:45:35,535
but never mind. He dodges it.

2853
03:45:35,535 --> 03:45:39,223
(laughter)

2854
03:45:39,223 --> 03:45:42,304
LIAM: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke
his brain.

2855
03:45:42,304 --> 03:45:50,718
MATT: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine
whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He

2856
03:45:50,718 --> 03:45:54,595
dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly
against the stone and withdraws back into the

2857
03:45:54,595 --> 03:45:59,361
small crack of stone where it's based. That ends
your turn. All right, Grog.

2858
03:45:59,361 --> 03:46:06,036
TRAVIS: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that
some sort of impossible miracle happens.

2859
03:46:06,036 --> 03:46:16,221
(counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I
look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down

2860
03:46:16,221 --> 03:46:23,646
there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from
vision? Is that a moveable space?

2861
03:46:23,646 --> 03:46:29,474
MATT: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being
used to carve a path.

2862
03:46:29,474 --> 03:46:31,753
TRAVIS: It hadn't finished doing it?

2863
03:46:31,753 --> 03:46:36,001
MATT: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was
hitting solid rock.

2864
03:46:36,001 --> 03:46:41,656
LAURA: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if
I have increased that in a while.

2865
03:46:41,656 --> 03:46:45,262
LIAM: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her
spell bonus.

2866
03:46:45,262 --> 03:46:48,211
LAURA: So my spell DC is 17.

2867
03:46:48,211 --> 03:46:50,556
MATT: You need to keep up on that, girl.

2868
03:46:50,556 --> 03:46:54,731
MARISHA: That was how I lost to Grog in our
battle.

2869
03:46:54,731 --> 03:47:04,450
LAURA: I wanted it around his neck, just to make
him annoyed.

2870
03:47:04,450 --> 03:47:07,120
MATT: It hits him against the wall. He's still
glancing over his shoulder.

2871
03:47:07,120 --> 03:47:09,568
TALIESIN: He's lost visual range of the ball?

2872
03:47:09,568 --> 03:47:12,868
MATT: No, he can still look over the rubble
there.

2873
03:47:12,868 --> 03:47:16,550
TRAVIS: Not enough to make a concentration check?

2874
03:47:16,550 --> 03:47:18,950
MATT: If that's what it does.

2875
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:27,191
TRAVIS: I'm there. I can't get into that hole
anymore, can I?

2876
03:47:27,191 --> 03:47:31,820
MATT: Not with the way the Wall of Force is
placed, no.

2877
03:47:31,820 --> 03:47:36,864
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I will hold my action until
someone comes within melee distance.

2878
03:47:36,864 --> 03:47:40,232
MATT: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the
staircase--

2879
03:47:40,232 --> 03:47:44,175
LAURA: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!

2880
03:47:44,175 --> 03:47:55,132
MATT: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far
from the stairs and continues that way.

2881
03:47:55,132 --> 03:48:00,362
MARISHA: Sanctuary!

2882
03:48:00,362 --> 03:48:02,775
TALIESIN: Like he's parting the Red Sea.

2883
03:48:02,775 --> 03:48:07,028
TALIESIN and MARISHA: You shall not pass!

2884
03:48:07,028 --> 03:48:10,811
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf
right now, you guys.

2885
03:48:10,811 --> 03:48:13,368
TALIESIN: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.

2886
03:48:13,368 --> 03:48:18,009
LIAM: Do you know many hobbits I have under my
cloak?

2887
03:48:18,009 --> 03:48:21,052
TALIESIN: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it
is. It's not a wizard.

2888
03:48:21,052 --> 03:48:28,352
MATT: He glances down at the staircase where you
are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the

2889
03:48:28,352 --> 03:48:34,775
eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to
Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to

2890
03:48:34,775 --> 03:48:41,403
him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He
begins to speak in a language you don't

2891
03:48:41,403 --> 03:48:50,704
understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how
many hit points do you have?

2892
03:48:50,704 --> 03:48:54,240
SAM: A lot. 167.

2893
03:48:54,240 --> 03:48:59,493
MATT: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.

2894
03:48:59,493 --> 03:49:02,567
SAM: Power Word?

2895
03:49:02,567 --> 03:49:12,653
MATT: Power Word: Stun. He assumed the smaller
stature of the gnome was not as hearty.

2896
03:49:12,653 --> 03:49:19,019
TRAVIS: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM
wants blood!

2897
03:49:19,019 --> 03:49:21,461
LIAM: That's what he gets for profiling.

2898
03:49:21,461 --> 03:49:33,777
MATT: He's going to continue moving upward, 30
feet back up into the staircase as he keeps

2899
03:49:33,777 --> 03:49:39,713
focusing on you. That's going to end his turn.
You're up, Scanlan.

2900
03:49:39,713 --> 03:49:52,651
SAM: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a
fucking spell. How far is he from me?

2901
03:49:52,651 --> 03:49:57,320
MATT: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say
somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.

2902
03:49:57,320 --> 03:50:00,689
LIAM: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.

2903
03:50:00,689 --> 03:50:03,648
SAM: I'm looking. That one's not.

2904
03:50:03,648 --> 03:50:06,507
LIAM: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right
where your eyes are.

2905
03:50:06,507 --> 03:50:09,449
SAM: You said how far? Oh shit.

2906
03:50:09,449 --> 03:50:11,317
MATT: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.

2907
03:50:11,317 --> 03:50:12,832
LAURA and LIAM: You can move.

2908
03:50:12,832 --> 03:50:15,315
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.

2909
03:50:15,315 --> 03:50:20,144
MATT: Okay, so that puts you up here.

2910
03:50:20,144 --> 03:50:24,285
SAM: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for
how far he is from me now?

2911
03:50:24,285 --> 03:50:27,001
MATT: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from
you.

2912
03:50:27,001 --> 03:50:31,359
SAM: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.

2913
03:50:31,359 --> 03:50:34,919
LAURA: You can move five more feet. You've got
more movement.

2914
03:50:34,919 --> 03:50:39,456
SAM: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little
nubs.

2915
03:50:39,456 --> 03:50:42,788
TRAVIS: Tiny little nubs?

2916
03:50:42,788 --> 03:50:43,941
SAM: Yeah.

2917
03:50:43,941 --> 03:50:45,493
LIAM: What about long-range shit, man?

2918
03:50:45,493 --> 03:50:50,438
SAM: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range
shit, but it's not as bad news.

2919
03:50:50,438 --> 03:50:52,402
MARISHA: Keep them from running away.

2920
03:50:52,402 --> 03:50:56,499
TRAVIS: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?

2921
03:50:56,499 --> 03:50:59,317
MATT: Because that tactically made sense.

2922
03:50:59,317 --> 03:51:03,145
LIAM: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?

2923
03:51:03,145 --> 03:51:10,604
SAM: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between
two things.

2924
03:51:10,604 --> 03:51:15,140
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take
your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on,

2925
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:19,499
let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel
the love.

2926
03:51:19,499 --> 03:51:22,056
MARISHA: This is all on you, man. This is all on
you.

2927
03:51:22,056 --> 03:51:29,566
TRAVIS: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes
out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.

2928
03:51:29,566 --> 03:51:37,432
SAM: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All
right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a

2929
03:51:37,432 --> 03:51:51,087
lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At
level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.

2930
03:51:51,087 --> 03:51:55,991
LAURA: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on
the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.

2931
03:51:55,991 --> 03:51:57,574
MARISHA: That's a good call.

2932
03:51:57,574 --> 03:52:03,585
MATT: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if
you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.

2933
03:52:03,585 --> 03:52:07,056
LAURA and TALIESIN: Inspire yourself!

2934
03:52:07,056 --> 03:52:16,659
SAM: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.

2935
03:52:16,659 --> 03:52:22,288
MATT: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a
lot of armor.

2936
03:52:22,288 --> 03:52:24,414
MARISHA: Kill him!

2937
03:52:24,414 --> 03:52:27,092
MATT: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.

2938
03:52:27,092 --> 03:52:28,898
TALIESIN: I have three.

2939
03:52:28,898 --> 03:52:30,707
SAM: And I've got one.

2940
03:52:30,707 --> 03:52:34,004
LIAM: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a
bathrobe. Punch him!

2941
03:52:34,004 --> 03:52:37,590
TALIESIN: Wow, that was a deep cut.

2942
03:52:37,590 --> 03:52:59,363
SAM: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus
four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.

2943
03:52:59,363 --> 03:53:00,718
MATT: 40 points of force damage.

2944
03:53:00,718 --> 03:53:02,140
SAM: 40 points of force damage.

2945
03:53:02,140 --> 03:53:04,329
MATT: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration
check.

2946
03:53:04,329 --> 03:53:05,505
SAM: Yeah.

2947
03:53:05,505 --> 03:53:08,097
TRAVIS: Come on.

2948
03:53:08,097 --> 03:53:09,498
MATT: 16. No.

2949
03:53:09,498 --> 03:53:16,345
ALL: Wall down!

2950
03:53:16,345 --> 03:53:18,276
LAURA: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall
went down?

2951
03:53:18,276 --> 03:53:20,619
MATT: No, you don't see it.

2952
03:53:20,619 --> 03:53:22,501
SAM: I don't know. Right?

2953
03:53:22,501 --> 03:53:29,906
MATT: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting
there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand

2954
03:53:29,906 --> 03:53:41,509
full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he
slams against the steps and has to shake his head

2955
03:53:41,509 --> 03:53:43,871
as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.

2956
03:53:43,871 --> 03:53:48,442
SAM: As a bonus action, can I do anything?

2957
03:53:48,442 --> 03:53:54,475
MATT: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't
do Bigby's Hand again.

2958
03:53:54,475 --> 03:54:03,152
SAM: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes
through the wall?

2959
03:54:03,152 --> 03:54:07,610
MATT: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack
roll, just to aim it.

2960
03:54:07,610 --> 03:54:11,895
SAM: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.

2961
03:54:11,895 --> 03:54:13,231
MATT: What are you throwing?

2962
03:54:13,231 --> 03:54:19,744
SAM: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers
in the desk in the casino.

2963
03:54:19,744 --> 03:54:25,859
MATT: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that
he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch

2964
03:54:25,859 --> 03:54:28,198
as this dagger passes through.

2965
03:54:28,198 --> 03:54:33,135
TALIESIN: I see that, and I take three shots at
this fucker up here immediately. How far away

2966
03:54:33,135 --> 03:54:33,979
is he?

2967
03:54:33,979 --> 03:54:44,021
MATT: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just
punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.

2968
03:54:44,021 --> 03:54:49,502
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because
that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle.

2969
03:54:49,502 --> 03:54:52,387
He's going to take that.

2970
03:54:52,387 --> 03:54:54,418
LAURA: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in
front of me.

2971
03:54:54,418 --> 03:54:59,528
TALIESIN: I can't use a bonus action, and I have
to reload once, so I can only take two shots with

2972
03:54:59,528 --> 03:55:16,338
my action. I can't take three. So two shots with
Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.

2973
03:55:16,338 --> 03:55:17,506
MATT: Both hit.

2974
03:55:17,506 --> 03:55:37,606
TALIESIN: First shot is 22 points of damage.
Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.

2975
03:55:37,606 --> 03:55:49,390
MATT: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing
noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the

2976
03:55:49,390 --> 03:55:51,506
hallway and stairway above. Vex.

2977
03:55:51,506 --> 03:55:54,540
LAURA: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy
right in front of me.

2978
03:55:54,540 --> 03:55:56,888
TALIESIN: There's a lot of noises going on in this
place. I think it'll be okay.

2979
03:55:56,888 --> 03:56:03,586
MARISHA: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels
collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned

2980
03:56:03,586 --> 03:56:05,192
about the noise at the moment.

2981
03:56:05,192 --> 03:56:06,559
LAURA: 22 to hit?

2982
03:56:06,559 --> 03:56:07,687
MATT: 22 does hit.

2983
03:56:07,687 --> 03:56:32,582
LAURA: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the
second. That's also Sharpshooter.

2984
03:56:32,582 --> 03:56:34,007
MATT: Nice.

2985
03:56:34,007 --> 03:56:36,352
LAURA: No, that's 19 to hit.

2986
03:56:36,352 --> 03:56:38,695
MATT: Gotcha. That hits.

2987
03:56:38,695 --> 03:56:47,217
LAURA: 27 on the second.

2988
03:56:47,217 --> 03:56:56,216
MATT: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling
the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him

2989
03:56:56,216 --> 03:57:03,663
right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up
the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with

2990
03:57:03,663 --> 03:57:07,818
your second arrow and release it, and it hits the
base of the skull. You watch him go down one of

2991
03:57:07,818 --> 03:57:09,443
the stairs.

2992
03:57:09,443 --> 03:57:15,388
TALIESIN: So the sphere is still there?

2993
03:57:15,388 --> 03:57:17,178
MATT: The sphere is still there.

2994
03:57:17,178 --> 03:57:24,769
LAURA: But he doesn't have control over it
anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's

2995
03:57:24,769 --> 03:57:27,058
left is the guy and the wraiths?

2996
03:57:27,058 --> 03:57:29,082
TALIESIN: Was there a third guy?

2997
03:57:29,082 --> 03:57:32,277
LAURA: We killed him. That was the first guy we
killed.

2998
03:57:32,277 --> 03:57:36,584
MATT: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?

2999
03:57:36,584 --> 03:57:39,341
LAURA: Yeah, that was your turn.

3000
03:57:39,341 --> 03:57:40,523
SAM: Yeah, I'm done.

3001
03:57:40,523 --> 03:57:45,718
MATT: Keyleth's turn.

3002
03:57:45,718 --> 03:57:57,337
MARISHA: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet.
Do I see this motherfucker?

3003
03:57:57,337 --> 03:58:01,451
MATT: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range
of darkvision?

3004
03:58:01,451 --> 03:58:06,344
MARISHA: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?

3005
03:58:06,344 --> 03:58:12,433
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him
okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.

3006
03:58:12,433 --> 03:58:13,712
MARISHA: Fireball!

3007
03:58:13,712 --> 03:58:18,008
(laughter)

3008
03:58:18,008 --> 03:58:19,282
TALIESIN: That's an answer.

3009
03:58:19,282 --> 03:58:28,937
MATT: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff,
a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in

3010
03:58:28,937 --> 03:58:34,371
flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's
Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go

3011
03:58:34,371 --> 03:58:39,215
ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20
on his save, so he gets half damage.

3012
03:58:39,215 --> 03:58:41,482
MARISHA: What the fuckballs?

3013
03:58:41,482 --> 03:58:46,119
MATT: I didn't even roll with advantage on that
one.

3014
03:58:46,119 --> 03:58:54,043
SAM: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand
takes damage.

3015
03:58:54,043 --> 03:58:55,250
MARISHA: Does he? Magical?

3016
03:58:55,250 --> 03:58:56,634
SAM: Yeah, he has hit points.

3017
03:58:56,634 --> 03:58:58,141
TALIESIN: He could roll a save, though.

3018
03:58:58,141 --> 03:58:59,587
SAM: He could!

3019
03:58:59,587 --> 03:59:14,665
MATT: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you
roll a d20 and see what you get.

3020
03:59:14,665 --> 03:59:19,731
SAM: 11.

3021
03:59:19,731 --> 03:59:26,385
MARISHA: 29 points of damage.

3022
03:59:26,385 --> 03:59:32,392
SAM: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.

3023
03:59:32,392 --> 03:59:34,200
MATT: Yeah, it has your hit points.

3024
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:36,547
LAURA: That's amazing!

3025
03:59:36,547 --> 03:59:37,909
SAM: Yeah, it's me.

3026
03:59:37,909 --> 03:59:50,201
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive.
This one's going to move through the hallway here.

3027
03:59:50,201 --> 03:59:53,269
MARISHA: He's still going after my ass?

3028
03:59:53,269 --> 03:59:55,442
MATT: This one's going after Pike.

3029
03:59:55,442 --> 03:59:58,065
LIAM: I get to attack. I've been holding.

3030
03:59:58,065 --> 04:00:01,099
LAURA: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding
her action to attack as soon as she could, too.

3031
04:00:01,099 --> 04:00:05,871
MATT: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.

3032
04:00:05,871 --> 04:00:11,446
LAURA: So 20 to hit on Pike.

3033
04:00:11,446 --> 04:00:13,136
MATT: 20 to hit? That hits.

3034
04:00:13,136 --> 04:00:21,881
LAURA: Where is my other d8? Here it is.
(counting)

3035
04:00:21,881 --> 04:00:31,221
LIAM: When you hold, does bonus action carry
over?

3036
04:00:31,221 --> 04:00:32,698
MATT: Nope, just the action.

3037
04:00:32,698 --> 04:00:34,169
LAURA: So it's 22.

3038
04:00:34,169 --> 04:00:36,622
MATT: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?

3039
04:00:36,622 --> 04:00:38,569
LAURA: Saving throw is 15.

3040
04:00:38,569 --> 04:00:48,714
MATT: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall
reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace.

3041
04:00:48,714 --> 04:00:53,420
As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine
energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching

3042
04:00:53,420 --> 04:00:59,284
burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the
creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the

3043
04:00:59,284 --> 04:01:05,811
mace actually dashes it from this existence or any
other. That is scattered into nothing from the

3044
04:01:05,811 --> 04:01:07,103
shadows.

3045
04:01:07,103 --> 04:01:08,730
LIAM: I rolled an 18 and a one.

3046
04:01:08,730 --> 04:01:10,114
MATT: 18 hits. One misses.

3047
04:01:10,114 --> 04:01:13,111
LIAM: Okay, so sneak attack. One.

3048
04:01:13,111 --> 04:01:14,687
SAM: One misses?

3049
04:01:14,687 --> 04:01:16,249
LAURA: I know, right?

3050
04:01:16,249 --> 04:01:30,635
LIAM: 39 for the second attack.

3051
04:01:30,635 --> 04:01:36,232
MATT: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And
with that, as this one reaches out towards

3052
04:01:36,232 --> 04:01:43,005
Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body,
and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form

3053
04:01:43,005 --> 04:01:49,131
turns into nothing but a splash of dark,
half-existing ether, which then fades as your

3054
04:01:49,131 --> 04:01:51,208
dagger clatters to the ground motionless.

3055
04:01:51,208 --> 04:01:52,854
LIAM: Back to the belt.

3056
04:01:52,854 --> 04:01:57,161
MATT: All right. Percival, you're up.

3057
04:01:57,161 --> 04:01:59,142
LAURA: Kill him!

3058
04:01:59,142 --> 04:02:02,024
TALIESIN: Reload. Going to take another shot.

3059
04:02:02,024 --> 04:02:03,439
MATT: All righty.

3060
04:02:03,439 --> 04:02:11,313
TALIESIN: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take
another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make

3061
04:02:11,313 --> 04:02:20,680
this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a
sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?

3062
04:02:20,680 --> 04:02:21,890
MATT: 24 hits.

3063
04:02:21,890 --> 04:02:31,264
TALIESIN: All right. So let's do (counting) 26
points of damage.

3064
04:02:31,264 --> 04:02:39,021
MATT: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of
the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and

3065
04:02:39,021 --> 04:02:46,042
throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown
apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had

3066
04:02:46,042 --> 04:02:52,456
barely started to get up off to and you watch and
you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last

3067
04:02:52,456 --> 04:02:56,823
moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to
get back up and then stumbles right back and

3068
04:02:56,823 --> 04:02:58,567
bleeds out against the steps.

3069
04:02:58,567 --> 04:03:07,015
TALIESIN: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't
have to be alive for that. Any other problems?

3070
04:03:07,015 --> 04:03:09,002
LIAM: How's the ball doing?

3071
04:03:09,002 --> 04:03:11,726
MATT: It's hovering there in the center of the
hall.

3072
04:03:11,726 --> 04:03:16,985
LAURA: We can't do anything about that floating
ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.

3073
04:03:16,985 --> 04:03:20,239
MARISHA: You beat me to it, man.

3074
04:03:20,239 --> 04:03:27,955
TALIESIN: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff.
Which one do we want to interrogate?

3075
04:03:27,955 --> 04:03:32,732
MARISHA: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.

3076
04:03:32,732 --> 04:03:39,348
TALIESIN: Let's throw gray robe into the
annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.

3077
04:03:39,348 --> 04:03:43,292
TRAVIS: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and
see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.

3078
04:03:43,292 --> 04:03:46,657
LAURA: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather
up around me again.

3079
04:03:46,657 --> 04:03:51,318
LIAM: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go
a little further ahead.

3080
04:03:51,318 --> 04:03:54,445
MATT: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.

3081
04:03:54,445 --> 04:03:58,811
TALIESIN: Everyone gather up. We're going to get
our stuff.

3082
04:03:58,811 --> 04:04:01,021
LAURA: Avoid the ball.

3083
04:04:01,021 --> 04:04:03,215
MARISHA: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?

3084
04:04:03,215 --> 04:04:05,491
LIAM: Yeah. I give her Whisper.

3085
04:04:05,491 --> 04:04:10,261
MARISHA: I take it and I stab it in his other eye.
Red robe guy.

3086
04:04:10,261 --> 04:04:13,618
MATT: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.

3087
04:04:13,618 --> 04:04:18,361
SAM: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the
sphere.

3088
04:04:18,361 --> 04:04:25,861
MATT: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and
grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form

3089
04:04:25,861 --> 04:04:36,894
attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive
energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force

3090
04:04:36,894 --> 04:04:38,690
damage and is forced to pull back.

3091
04:04:38,690 --> 04:04:40,315
SAM: That's not so bad.

3092
04:04:40,315 --> 04:04:44,395
MATT: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it.
(electrical shock)

3093
04:04:44,395 --> 04:04:47,931
LAURA: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red
robe.

3094
04:04:47,931 --> 04:04:50,849
TALIESIN: I'm going to get Odell.

3095
04:04:50,849 --> 04:04:53,561
MATT: That's the one she's rifling through.

3096
04:04:53,561 --> 04:04:56,454
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right,
that they killed early on?

3097
04:04:56,454 --> 04:04:59,542
MATT: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.

3098
04:04:59,542 --> 04:05:03,977
TALIESIN: Assume we're going through everybody
and taking their shit.

3099
04:05:03,977 --> 04:05:07,654
LIAM: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I
can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.

3100
04:05:07,654 --> 04:05:14,244
MATT: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the
current scenario and what preparation has been, no

3101
04:05:14,244 --> 04:05:21,545
money on them. They have no worldly possessions
that are what you consider of use. They each carry

3102
04:05:21,545 --> 04:05:27,334
a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a
focus for their spellcasting.

3103
04:05:27,334 --> 04:05:41,829
Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for
the one that you shot has, you notice the

3104
04:05:41,829 --> 04:05:48,226
left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled
taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is

3105
04:05:48,226 --> 04:05:52,237
no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of
Vecna they wear around their throat.

3106
04:05:52,237 --> 04:05:56,732
MARISHA: How many of those symbols do we still
have, and how many robes do we still have?

3107
04:05:56,732 --> 04:06:02,356
LAURA: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know
how many of those we have, but I think we also

3108
04:06:02,356 --> 04:06:03,670
have a necklace.

3109
04:06:03,670 --> 04:06:05,927
LIAM: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these
arseholes.

3110
04:06:05,927 --> 04:06:09,633
TALIESIN: I think that's a good idea.

3111
04:06:09,633 --> 04:06:12,676
MARISHA: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe,
I'm going to rip his necklace off.

3112
04:06:12,676 --> 04:06:14,176
MATT: Okay. You tear it off.

3113
04:06:14,176 --> 04:06:17,411
LAURA: I'm going to take his robes.

3114
04:06:17,411 --> 04:06:19,575
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.

3115
04:06:19,575 --> 04:06:23,957
MATT: So you take every set of robes. And these
robes are different from the robes that you had

3116
04:06:23,957 --> 04:06:27,724
seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a
little more ornate. They seem to have a little

3117
04:06:27,724 --> 04:06:33,867
higher station, which is why it's interesting that
beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and

3118
04:06:33,867 --> 04:06:38,294
the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a
sheer conduit of their own power.

3119
04:06:38,294 --> 04:06:44,038
TALIESIN: Were they drilling? I want to take a
little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling

3120
04:06:44,038 --> 04:06:46,016
with this thing? Is that why they had it?

3121
04:06:46,016 --> 04:06:51,046
MATT: Looking around the pathway, you can see that
a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in,

3122
04:06:51,046 --> 04:06:56,035
but has been cleared out by the movement of this
orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool

3123
04:06:56,035 --> 04:06:58,539
as they push deeper into the catacombs here.

3124
04:06:58,539 --> 04:07:02,228
MARISHA: So they were holding on to that orb the
whole time.

3125
04:07:02,228 --> 04:07:04,998
LAURA: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling
it.

3126
04:07:04,998 --> 04:07:08,222
MARISHA: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We
didn't see him cast that.

3127
04:07:08,222 --> 04:07:09,969
LAURA: It came out of the wall.

3128
04:07:09,969 --> 04:07:13,148
MATT: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the
side there.

3129
04:07:13,148 --> 04:07:24,638
SAM: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to
it: I command thee to respect my authority and

3130
04:07:24,638 --> 04:07:26,923
obey me as your new master.

3131
04:07:26,923 --> 04:07:28,834
MATT: Are you trying to exert your will on the
sphere?

3132
04:07:28,834 --> 04:07:30,441
SAM: I'm intimidating the sphere.

3133
04:07:30,441 --> 04:07:33,187
MATT: Make an intelligence arcana check.

3134
04:07:33,187 --> 04:07:35,056
SAM: Intelligence arcana check?

3135
04:07:35,056 --> 04:07:37,493
MATT: Just an arcana check.

3136
04:07:37,493 --> 04:07:40,318
SAM: Oh! 19.

3137
04:07:40,318 --> 04:07:45,786
MATT: 19? And you're standing right next to the
sphere to push your will into it?

3138
04:07:45,786 --> 04:07:47,430
SAM: Yeah, I came closer to it.

3139
04:07:47,430 --> 04:07:55,347
MATT: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the
orb, and you can feel your will push past the

3140
04:07:55,347 --> 04:08:01,449
event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is
too strong inside, and as you pull out of it

3141
04:08:01,449 --> 04:08:04,560
instinctually, it moves towards you.

3142
04:08:04,560 --> 04:08:06,413
(screaming)

3143
04:08:06,413 --> 04:08:10,558
TALIESIN: Why did you have to tamper with the
fundamental forces of nature?

3144
04:08:10,558 --> 04:08:14,041
MATT: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you
are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

3145
04:08:14,041 --> 04:08:16,625
LIAM: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of
it for you.

3146
04:08:16,625 --> 04:08:18,925
SAM: That's not good. 11.

3147
04:08:18,925 --> 04:08:20,442
MATT: 11?

3148
04:08:20,442 --> 04:08:23,226
SAM: Bigby, save me!

3149
04:08:23,226 --> 04:08:30,102
MATT: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge
of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as

3150
04:08:30,102 --> 04:08:34,656
his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at
the exterior of the sphere.

3151
04:08:34,656 --> 04:08:39,141
LAURA: Can we reach down and grab him away from
it?

3152
04:08:39,141 --> 04:08:40,750
MARISHA: Yeah, Grasping Vine!

3153
04:08:40,750 --> 04:08:49,775
MATT: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's
currently now right in your square, right up

3154
04:08:49,775 --> 04:08:51,788
against you.

3155
04:08:51,788 --> 04:08:54,572
LAURA: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away
from it.

3156
04:08:54,572 --> 04:08:55,877
MARISHA: Yeah, move away!

3157
04:08:55,877 --> 04:08:58,529
MATT: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and
the vine pulls him.

3158
04:08:58,529 --> 04:08:59,914
TRAVIS: Two-Face!

3159
04:08:59,914 --> 04:09:03,910
MATT: Yeah, you look a little rough.

3160
04:09:03,910 --> 04:09:05,525
LAURA: Scanlan, you're hideous now.

3161
04:09:05,525 --> 04:09:08,945
SAM: Don't look at me! I'm fine.

3162
04:09:08,945 --> 04:09:11,477
TRAVIS: Some other voice starts coming out of
him.

3163
04:09:11,477 --> 04:09:16,697
SAM: I think I can take this thing.

3164
04:09:16,697 --> 04:09:20,735
LIAM: "So did you want me to talk to one of these
guys?"

3165
04:09:20,735 --> 04:09:30,481
MATT: You got the sense that there is a way to
exert your will over it the way these guys did,

3166
04:09:30,481 --> 04:09:37,136
but in that moment, your will faltered, and you
didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.

3167
04:09:37,136 --> 04:09:39,895
SAM: I just need to try again harder.

3168
04:09:39,895 --> 04:09:43,349
MARISHA: Wait!

3169
04:09:43,349 --> 04:09:48,228
LAURA: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you
give yourself inspiration?

3170
04:09:48,228 --> 04:09:50,737
SAM: This is an ability check, right?

3171
04:09:50,737 --> 04:09:52,975
MATT: This is an ability check, yes.

3172
04:09:52,975 --> 04:09:55,438
TALIESIN: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?

3173
04:09:55,438 --> 04:09:57,225
MATT: No. It was an arcana check.

3174
04:09:57,225 --> 04:10:02,393
TRAVIS: It might be high, dude. You might have to
roll a 30.

3175
04:10:02,393 --> 04:10:07,207
TALIESIN: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and
leave the well alone.

3176
04:10:07,207 --> 04:10:09,678
TRAVIS: Indiana? Let it go.

3177
04:10:09,678 --> 04:10:15,109
LAURA: Or Dominate that shit.

3178
04:10:15,109 --> 04:10:17,115
SAM: I'll try one more time.

3179
04:10:17,115 --> 04:10:19,136
MATT: Okay.

3180
04:10:19,136 --> 04:10:20,679
TALIESIN: All right. Let's all back up.

3181
04:10:20,679 --> 04:10:24,894
LAURA: I get ready with the vine to yank him away
in case it starts moving toward him.

3182
04:10:24,894 --> 04:10:26,395
MATT: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.

3183
04:10:26,395 --> 04:10:33,896
MARISHA: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.

3184
04:10:33,896 --> 04:10:35,660
SAM: I'm going to inspire myself.

3185
04:10:35,660 --> 04:10:42,099
MATT: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin
to focus and exert your will towards it. You add

3186
04:10:42,099 --> 04:10:43,504
it on to it.

3187
04:10:43,504 --> 04:10:46,442
SAM: Pretty good.

3188
04:10:46,442 --> 04:10:47,843
LAURA: Now inspire!

3189
04:10:47,843 --> 04:10:49,284
SAM: And inspire?

3190
04:10:49,284 --> 04:10:50,697
MATT: Up to you.

3191
04:10:50,697 --> 04:10:57,869
SAM: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!

3192
04:10:57,869 --> 04:10:59,959
MATT: Yes.

3193
04:10:59,959 --> 04:11:02,714
SAM: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.

3194
04:11:02,714 --> 04:11:10,119
MATT: Okay. As you this time begin to push your
will towards the sphere, you push past the event

3195
04:11:10,119 --> 04:11:12,387
horizon, your consciousness connects with some--

3196
04:11:12,387 --> 04:11:18,682
SAM: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my
authority!

3197
04:11:18,682 --> 04:11:28,912
MATT: Some ancient space of the void within this
blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your

3198
04:11:28,912 --> 04:11:30,687
intelligence modifier?

3199
04:11:30,687 --> 04:11:33,957
SAM: Plus three.

3200
04:11:33,957 --> 04:11:36,652
MATT: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?

3201
04:11:36,652 --> 04:11:48,259
SAM: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a
big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!

3202
04:11:48,259 --> 04:11:55,205
MATT: It moves up ten feet and then it hits,
devours the stone above it to create this small

3203
04:11:55,205 --> 04:11:57,784
tunnel right directly above.

3204
04:11:57,784 --> 04:11:59,833
LAURA: Oh my god! You did it.

3205
04:11:59,833 --> 04:12:02,182
SAM: We can use it!

3206
04:12:02,182 --> 04:12:05,296
TALIESIN: Finally.

3207
04:12:05,296 --> 04:12:08,450
SAM: Have you guys seen The Explorers?

3208
04:12:08,450 --> 04:12:14,417
TALIESIN: I'm <i>in</i> The Explorers, motherfucker.
I'm <i>in</i> The Explorers.

3209
04:12:14,417 --> 04:12:19,526
SAM: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of
all time! Can I get your autograph?

3210
04:12:19,526 --> 04:12:20,838
TALIESIN: No.

3211
04:12:20,838 --> 04:12:23,778
LIAM: Were you kidding? Are you really in The
Explorers?

3212
04:12:23,778 --> 04:12:25,411
TALIESIN: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.

3213
04:12:25,411 --> 04:12:26,893
LIAM: Stop the game!

3214
04:12:26,893 --> 04:12:30,776
TALIESIN: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm
Ludwig.

3215
04:12:30,776 --> 04:12:32,277
SAM: Oh, wow!

3216
04:12:32,277 --> 04:12:37,128
MARISHA: Yeah, he knew River through that.

3217
04:12:37,128 --> 04:12:45,414
LAURA: What if we use the orb and go straight up?
We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight

3218
04:12:45,414 --> 04:12:46,737
up to the city.

3219
04:12:46,737 --> 04:12:48,857
SAM: It only listens to me.

3220
04:12:48,857 --> 04:12:53,624
LAURA: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or
anything?

3221
04:12:53,624 --> 04:12:55,317
SAM: No, this is a cool thing.

3222
04:12:55,317 --> 04:13:00,857
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size.
It's two feet across.

3223
04:13:00,857 --> 04:13:06,472
TALIESIN: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie
on this thing yet.

3224
04:13:06,472 --> 04:13:09,810
TRAVIS: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating
super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will

3225
04:13:09,810 --> 04:13:10,937
probably be able to do.

3226
04:13:10,937 --> 04:13:19,716
MARISHA: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we
can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are

3227
04:13:19,716 --> 04:13:21,628
The Champions?

3228
04:13:21,628 --> 04:13:27,953
SAM: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't!
We'll never make it! Yes, we can!

3229
04:13:27,953 --> 04:13:34,873
LIAM: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do
Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made

3230
04:13:34,873 --> 04:13:36,250
your bed, lie in it.

3231
04:13:36,250 --> 04:13:39,635
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.

3232
04:13:39,635 --> 04:13:42,980
LAURA: What do you think? Do you want to go up?

3233
04:13:42,980 --> 04:13:45,491
SAM: We're still investigating these guys and
stuff.

3234
04:13:45,491 --> 04:13:47,906
MARISHA: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit.
Let's go!

3235
04:13:47,906 --> 04:13:58,752
SAM: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.

3236
04:13:58,752 --> 04:14:04,686
TRAVIS: Do we know how far the sphere can move in
a single movement?

3237
04:14:04,686 --> 04:14:08,112
MATT: You watched him push it, and it went about
15 feet.

3238
04:14:08,112 --> 04:14:10,531
TRAVIS: The sphere can only move 15 feet.

3239
04:14:10,531 --> 04:14:11,825
SAM: It will slow us down.

3240
04:14:11,825 --> 04:14:14,594
MATT: It's a very slow-moving ball of
destruction.

3241
04:14:14,594 --> 04:14:20,918
TALIESIN: Bring the sphere back down so that we
can throw their bodies into the sphere so that

3242
04:14:20,918 --> 04:14:22,540
they don't turn into undead fuckwads.

3243
04:14:22,540 --> 04:14:30,577
LIAM: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know
what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.

3244
04:14:30,577 --> 04:14:35,439
LAURA: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does
it work on undead?

3245
04:14:35,439 --> 04:14:45,671
LIAM: A creature that enters the spell's area for
the first time. If it fails.

3246
04:14:45,671 --> 04:14:51,219
LAURA: So you could cast it, and then Pike could
cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into

3247
04:14:51,219 --> 04:14:52,519
the Zone of Truth.

3248
04:14:52,519 --> 04:14:53,593
LIAM: That's right.

3249
04:14:53,593 --> 04:14:55,706
TRAVIS: No, they have to tell the truth when you
do Speak with Dead.

3250
04:14:55,706 --> 04:14:57,201
LIAM: No, they don't.

3251
04:14:57,201 --> 04:14:58,258
MATT: They don't have to.

3252
04:14:58,258 --> 04:14:59,503
MARISHA: They can lie.

3253
04:14:59,503 --> 04:15:04,159
TALIESIN: Here's a weird question: what saving
throw do they have to make to speak the truth?

3254
04:15:04,159 --> 04:15:10,082
LIAM: An affected creature is aware of the spell
and can thus avoid answering questions to which it

3255
04:15:10,082 --> 04:15:13,723
would normally respond with a lie. So it could
avoid the questions.

3256
04:15:13,723 --> 04:15:15,934
LAURA: But they have to answer the questions.

3257
04:15:15,934 --> 04:15:19,203
LIAM: But they <i>have</i> to answer the questions
because of the other spell.

3258
04:15:19,203 --> 04:15:20,422
LAURA: Right?

3259
04:15:20,422 --> 04:15:22,339
SAM: Double mumbo-jumbo?

3260
04:15:22,339 --> 04:15:29,821
MATT: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing
this. Technically, a creature would be unable to

3261
04:15:29,821 --> 04:15:31,440
lie in the area.

3262
04:15:31,440 --> 04:15:34,029
LIAM: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--

3263
04:15:34,029 --> 04:15:35,826
LAURA and LIAM: They have to answer the question.

3264
04:15:35,826 --> 04:15:38,623
MATT: Let me double-check for you.

3265
04:15:38,623 --> 04:15:41,765
TALIESIN: And what's the save?

3266
04:15:41,765 --> 04:15:49,315
LIAM: Charisma saving throw against <i>my</i> spell
save DC, which is not huge.

3267
04:15:49,315 --> 04:15:51,651
MARISHA: What is it?

3268
04:15:51,651 --> 04:15:53,333
LIAM: 16.

3269
04:15:53,333 --> 04:15:56,912
MATT: I mean, it does have to answer.

3270
04:15:56,912 --> 04:16:00,431
LIAM: I like it.

3271
04:16:00,431 --> 04:16:02,795
TALIESIN: Are we going to try this crazy shit?

3272
04:16:02,795 --> 04:16:04,047
LAURA: Let's do it!

3273
04:16:04,047 --> 04:16:07,398
MARISHA: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though!
What are we going to get from this guy?

3274
04:16:07,398 --> 04:16:09,632
LAURA: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.

3275
04:16:09,632 --> 04:16:13,144
TALIESIN: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they
trying to do?

3276
04:16:13,144 --> 04:16:16,641
LIAM: What has Vecna got cooking?

3277
04:16:16,641 --> 04:16:18,677
TALIESIN: What's Vecna planning? How many of them
are there?

3278
04:16:18,677 --> 04:16:21,276
MARISHA: I'm going to go pee, you guys.

3279
04:16:21,276 --> 04:16:24,906
LIAM: He might not know everything. How long does
it take for Keyleth to pee?

3280
04:16:24,906 --> 04:16:31,511
LAURA: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim?
What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big

3281
04:16:31,511 --> 04:16:35,913
is his army? We get five questions, I think, with
Speak with Dead.

3282
04:16:35,913 --> 04:16:37,155
TALIESIN: Five?

3283
04:16:37,155 --> 04:16:40,048
SAM: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is
he?

3284
04:16:40,048 --> 04:16:42,019
LAURA: Where is Vecna within the city?

3285
04:16:42,019 --> 04:16:44,346
SAM: Who's with him?

3286
04:16:44,346 --> 04:16:47,150
LAURA: Who's the death knight?

3287
04:16:47,150 --> 04:16:52,377
TALIESIN: He might not know that. But what are
they excavating for? What are they looking for?

3288
04:16:52,377 --> 04:16:53,862
TRAVIS: I think I know that.

3289
04:16:53,862 --> 04:16:57,575
TALIESIN: I think I know, too, but I want to hear
him say it. It'd make me feel better.

3290
04:16:57,575 --> 04:16:59,441
LAURA: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!

3291
04:16:59,441 --> 04:17:00,975
TALIESIN: Get in the zone.

3292
04:17:00,975 --> 04:17:02,624
LAURA: (singing) Autozone!

3293
04:17:02,624 --> 04:17:05,229
MATT: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?

3294
04:17:05,229 --> 04:17:16,634
LIAM: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his
roll to save, or boost me?

3295
04:17:16,634 --> 04:17:20,295
TALIESIN: No. Not me.

3296
04:17:20,295 --> 04:17:21,466
LAURA: I don't think so.

3297
04:17:21,466 --> 04:17:24,597
LIAM: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right.
Let's do it.

3298
04:17:24,597 --> 04:17:26,216
MATT: All right. So which one?

3299
04:17:26,216 --> 04:17:29,086
LIAM: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.

3300
04:17:29,086 --> 04:17:36,951
MATT: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you
create the area, the radial space where the divine

3301
04:17:36,951 --> 04:17:41,907
energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie
remains within. And then Pike--

3302
04:17:41,907 --> 04:17:43,630
LAURA: Casts Speak with Dead.

3303
04:17:43,630 --> 04:17:46,143
MATT: On which corpse? There are three corpses.

3304
04:17:46,143 --> 04:17:50,425
LIAM: Red robe seemed more fancy.

3305
04:17:50,425 --> 04:17:53,241
SAM: Who seemed more senior?

3306
04:17:53,241 --> 04:17:54,467
LIAM: Red robe did.

3307
04:17:54,467 --> 04:17:57,032
MATT: There are three, technically.

3308
04:17:57,032 --> 04:18:01,635
SAM: There was the guy they killed right when they
burst on the scene.

3309
04:18:01,635 --> 04:18:05,518
TALIESIN: We'll take the fanciest cloak.

3310
04:18:05,518 --> 04:18:12,832
MATT: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was
controlling the sphere seemed to be at least

3311
04:18:12,832 --> 04:18:14,179
different.

3312
04:18:14,179 --> 04:18:16,285
LAURA: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.

3313
04:18:16,285 --> 04:18:24,517
MATT: All right. So as Pike takes the time to
focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her

3314
04:18:24,517 --> 04:18:32,291
holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words
in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as

3315
04:18:32,291 --> 04:18:37,719
she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out
in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her

3316
04:18:37,719 --> 04:18:42,519
knees. No effect. And she suffers--

3317
04:18:42,519 --> 04:18:48,449
LAURA: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?

3318
04:18:48,449 --> 04:18:50,189
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3319
04:18:50,189 --> 04:18:57,901
MATT: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five.
That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.

3320
04:18:57,901 --> 04:19:02,273
LIAM: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.

3321
04:19:02,273 --> 04:19:07,126
MATT: She's shaking and grabbing her face and
rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to

3322
04:19:07,126 --> 04:19:12,743
come back to you and she looks around, and you can
see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of

3323
04:19:12,743 --> 04:19:18,078
the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard
was laughter."

3324
04:19:18,078 --> 04:19:19,842
SAM: Laughter?

3325
04:19:19,842 --> 04:19:22,481
LAURA: And you said it was minus 36 damage?

3326
04:19:22,481 --> 04:19:23,637
MATT: 31.

3327
04:19:23,637 --> 04:19:26,124
LIAM: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.

3328
04:19:26,124 --> 04:19:27,582
MARISHA: Everyone looks upset.

3329
04:19:27,582 --> 04:19:30,175
LAURA: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.

3330
04:19:30,175 --> 04:19:33,597
MARISHA: How much? A lot?

3331
04:19:33,597 --> 04:19:35,063
LAURA: 31 points of psychic damage.

3332
04:19:35,063 --> 04:19:36,583
MARISHA: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.

3333
04:19:36,583 --> 04:19:39,167
TALIESIN: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.

3334
04:19:39,167 --> 04:19:40,546
MARISHA: Throw them down the well.

3335
04:19:40,546 --> 04:19:41,909
TALIESIN: Throw them into the sphere.

3336
04:19:41,909 --> 04:19:44,053
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

3337
04:19:44,053 --> 04:19:47,375
SAM: Sphere! Do your worst.

3338
04:19:47,375 --> 04:19:51,110
MATT: One by one, you grab and take the corpses
and thrust them towards the sphere, as they

3339
04:19:51,110 --> 04:19:55,955
immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in,
turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black

3340
04:19:55,955 --> 04:20:02,809
void. There are elements of the way the sphere
acts and manipulates things that remind you of the

3341
04:20:02,809 --> 04:20:12,947
siphons, though differently. It's more violent in
some ways, and it is its own contained magical

3342
04:20:12,947 --> 04:20:18,965
entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere,
and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath

3343
04:20:18,965 --> 04:20:25,604
and deciding the next order of business in
traversing the insides of this titan.

3344
04:20:25,604 --> 04:20:29,295
And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because
it's 11:30.

3345
04:20:29,295 --> 04:20:34,500
MARISHA: I feel like I always come back from the
bathroom right as we're ending games.

3346
04:20:34,500 --> 04:20:42,485
SAM: First of all, it's so great to be back!

3347
04:20:42,485 --> 04:20:45,242
TALIESIN: It's so nice to be back.

3348
04:20:45,242 --> 04:20:50,054
SAM: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent
healed and all better again.

3349
04:20:50,054 --> 04:21:00,179
MATT: It's great. Sorry. But
yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week,

3350
04:21:00,179 --> 04:21:06,342
pick up from here, see as the final charge gets
closer and closer. What will you guys do next

3351
04:21:06,342 --> 04:21:12,631
time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if
you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support

3352
04:21:12,631 --> 04:21:17,349
the victims of recent hurricane battering in the
US.

3353
04:21:17,349 --> 04:21:19,977
LAURA: Look for Shadow of War.

3354
04:21:19,977 --> 04:21:22,488
MATT: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.

3355
04:21:22,488 --> 04:21:27,780
MARISHA: Our comic on Wednesday.

3356
04:21:27,780 --> 04:21:34,037
MATT: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys
soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is

3357
04:21:34,037 --> 04:21:36,843
it Thursday yet? Good night.

3358
04:21:36,843 --> 04:30:51,219
