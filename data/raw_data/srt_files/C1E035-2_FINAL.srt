1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:05,602
MATT: Cassandra, remembering this, drags
her body
through what remnant is there
on the ground.

2
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:10,107
There's a big groove left behind her as
she's
being dragged through it. You get
to the second

3
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:17,865
trap that she marked, and you guys make
your way
around it. You make your way to
where the road

4
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:22,662
diverges, the one way to the castle, and
the one
to the acid pits. And Cassandra
heads towards the

5
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:23,817
acid pits.

6
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,047
LAURA: Cassandra, what are you doing?

7
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:27,947
TRAVIS: She's throwing them in the acid
pits.

8
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:32,930
MATT: She doesn't look back at you. She
just keeps
walking. You follow her for
about five minutes.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,097
MARISHA: Are we sure this won't make
anything bad
happen if we throw a body
into the acid pits?

10
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,108
TALIESIN: I think it's fine.

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,267
TRAVIS: I think it's acid.

12
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,378
MARISHA: Okay.

13
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,438
MATT: After about five minutes of
following her,
the path leads up and
then crests, and there is a

14
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:55,257
room that smells awful. It's similar to
the acrid
scent the room was filled with
when the acid was

15
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:59,317
pouring into the room. There's a whole
series of
other chemicals and inside,
you can see there's a

16
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:05,278
number of laboratory set-ups near you.
You get the
feeling this is probably
where a lot of this

17
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:10,227
particular acidic concoction that was
fine-tuned
for this stone of Whitestone
was created, or at

18
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:21,218
least, honed by Ripley. Without a beat,
Cassandra
walks up to the edge and just
throws Delilah's

19
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:29,118
body in. (plop, sizzle) Then it
disappears beneath
the surface as the
hissing, bubbling noise takes

20
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:34,228
over the silence of the room. She sits
there and
just watches it sink.

21
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,728
LAURA: Well?

22
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:45,081
LIAM: She brought a lot of ill to this
world.
Don't feel too bad.

23
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,422
MATT: Cassandra turns back around.

24
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:50,340
TALIESIN: She was too dangerous to let
live.

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,972
MARISHA: What about you? How do you
feel?

26
00:01:58,072 --> 00:01:59,807
SAM: How's that gun barrel of yours?

27
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:00,948
MARISHA: Yeah.

28
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:04,018
TALIESIN: I pull out the broken barrel
and inspect
it.

29
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:15,130
MATT: Looking at it, you can see,
Delilah's name
is missing from the
barrel entirely. Cassandra's

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:24,830
name is still on the barrel, and so is
Ripley's.

31
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:33,608
Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

32
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:42,328
TALIESIN: I had some thoughts but yeah.
11.

33
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:49,629
MATT: Okay. Just looking at it, it looks
like the
names are there, emblazoned as
to where they were

34
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:50,788
before.

35
00:02:50,888 --> 00:03:03,150
TALIESIN: I'm going to just take the
broken gun
and point it at my sister.
What do I feel?

36
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,988
MATT: Currently, nothing.

37
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:13,479
TALIESIN: I think I'm all right. I think
I may be
all right.

38
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,526
SAM: Why don't you toss that thing into
the acid just
in case?

39
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:21,468
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something
else.

40
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,288
SAM: Are you going to shoot your sister
like you
just pointed your gun at her?
What was that

41
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:25,980
about?

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,600
TALIESIN: You were the one who wouldn't
give me
the other gun.

43
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,039
SAM: I gave you the other gun.

44
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,630
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over to the
little lab
setup. Is there some acid
there?

45
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,418
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence
check.

46
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:42,118
TALIESIN: 17.

47
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:47,778
MATT: 17? Yeah, a brief look around you
can see
there are many different
compounds, different

48
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:51,690
strengths of acid, what a lot of the
initial
experimentation was.

49
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,732
TALIESIN: I'm going to start trying to
scar her
name off the barrel.

50
00:03:55,832 --> 00:04:01,770
MATT: Okay. You take a moment and
eventually
manage to scar and dissolve
enough of the exterior

51
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,473
of that barrel until the name is no
longer
visible.

52
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,078
TALIESIN: I think it's fine.

53
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,340
SAM: (scoffs) You think it's fine?

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
LAURA: Lovely.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,590
TALIESIN: You're going to have to have
some
faith.

56
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,710
SAM: I don't have any faith! Here, we'll
make a
deal. I'll let you keep that gun
if you give me

57
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,810
the other one.

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,890
TALIESIN: No.

59
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,461
(laughter)

60
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:34,903
LAURA: So glad that your smoke monster
is
seemingly gone, Percy. That's
wonderful news. The

61
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:41,972
spinning orb of death, however, is still
back
there, so we should probably figure
out what to do

62
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,500
about that.

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,480
TALIESIN: Well, I think perhaps we can
talk to
Keeper Yennen. Perhaps put
together some priests

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,591
to deal with that. Enlist the help of
the entire
town now that there's no
longer

65
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,172
a revolution to be fought.

66
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,890
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a solid plan.

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,170
MARISHA: Oh, the revolution.

68
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,699
TALIESIN: We forgot about that.

69
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,882
MARISHA: We should go stop the fighting.
Right? We
should probably let them know
it's over.

70
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:07,072
LAURA: Probably.

71
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:10,650
TRAVIS: Well if they're fighting,
wouldn't it mean
it's not over?

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,431
MARISHA: Well, I'm sure they don't know
that the
Briarwoods are dead.

73
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:19,072
TALIESIN: So perhaps if we tell everyone
the
Briarwoods are dead. Cassandra?

74
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,491
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll see Ripley on the
way out.

75
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,261
TALIESIN: Wouldn't that be nice?

76
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:30,530
SAM: I just had a thought, Percy. I cast
Friends
on him.

77
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,072
MATT: Okay.

78
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:36,831
SAM: I think I know how to fix your gun,
if you
hand it to me.

79
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,310
TALIESIN: Never in my right mind would I
hand my
gun.

80
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:52,043
MATT: Go ahead and make a-- it'd be a
persuasion
check. And you go ahead and
make an insight check.

81
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,728
But you have an advantage on it. No, he
has
advantage on the persuasion, you do
not have it.

82
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,668
LIAM: While they're talking, can I
attempt to pull
it off of his belt?

83
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:01,635
MATT: Pull it off of Percy's?

84
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:05,022
TALIESIN: My insight is 21.

85
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:07,261
SAM: I rolled a natural 20.

86
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:11,321
TALIESIN: You are going to cost me so
much money.

87
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:16,863
LIAM: I see Scanlan kill it, and I just
step
back.

88
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:22,971
MATT: Okay. You look down at this gnome,
and while
he's normally pretty silly and
jovial, in this

89
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:30,622
moment, there's an honest spark of his
own
inspiration in his eyes.

90
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:37,192
TALIESIN: (whimpers) I'm so upset that I
have to
do this.

91
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,292
SAM: Wink!

92
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,071
TALIESIN: Going to kill you. I'm going
to kill
you.

93
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,312
TRAVIS: You don't know. He's your
friend. You're
not mad at all.

94
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,452
TALIESIN: For another three minutes.

95
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,762
LIAM: Yeah, roleplay for three minutes,
Taliesin.

96
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:52,233
TALIESIN: I hand him the broken gun.

97
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,401
MATT: Begrudgingly, you reach out and
place it in
his hand and release.

98
00:06:56,501 --> 00:07:06,299
SAM: I say, thank you, Percy. I think,
in due
time, you <i>will</i> thank me
for this. And I toss it

99
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,182
into the acid. As I say, when the spell
fades
he's going to be super pissed,

100
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,712
somebody protect me!

101
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:14,812
MARISHA: Okay.

102
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,445
TRAVIS: You want to hop on my shoulders?

103
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,873
SAM: Yes. I go run and jump on Grog's
shoulders.

104
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:25,103
MATT: As you watch it arc forward, in
your head,
you're like, "That fucking
gnome." The spell

105
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:32,363
fades, you hear him say that, and just
as it
(plop, sizzle).

106
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,322
TRAVIS: You're not going to get that,
are you?

107
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:36,243
TALIESIN: I reach in to try and grab it
out.

108
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:38,754
LAURA: No, Percy! And I reach out and I
grab his
hands.

109
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,814
TRAVIS: He threw it! You threw it,
though, right?

110
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,358
TALIESIN: No, he dropped it!

111
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,585
MATT: He lobbed it. It wasn't a huge
throw.

112
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,325
MARISHA: I cast Hold Person at 3rd
level.

113
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,183
MATT: On?

114
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:47,194
MARISHA: Percy!

115
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,993
LAURA: As I reach up and I grab his
hands as
well!

116
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,417
TALIESIN: That was so expensive!

117
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,683
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw with
advantage.

118
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,065
MARISHA: Son of a fuck.

119
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,533
MATT: Heroes' Feast, workin' against
you!

120
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,670
LIAM: You're the lord of Castle
Whitestone.

121
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,487
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving throw?

122
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:02,587
MATT: Yes.

123
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,772
TALIESIN: 18.

124
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,122
MATT: What's your DC?

125
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:08,314
MARISHA: My difficulty class? 18.

126
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:11,292
MATT: You're like, "That cost a--
(cracking)"

127
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:17,991
MARISHA: (laughs) I always fail rolls
against
Percy! It sucks!

128
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:23,074
MATT: A few moments pass. You don't even
see it
beneath the surface now. You just
see a little bit

129
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:28,682
of some fume released from whatever slow
process
is dissolving your gun.

130
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:35,467
LAURA: I step in front as he's
unconscious and I
go, Percy, dear.
You'll thank us for this later,

131
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,567
I know it.

132
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,214
TALIESIN: He's paying for a new one.

133
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,943
LAURA: I kiss his cheek and say, I'm so
sorry.

134
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:42,764
TALIESIN: He's paying for a new one.

135
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:44,524
MARISHA: We'll get you a new one, Percy.

136
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,184
TALIESIN: I'm going to have to-- oh god!

137
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:53,953
MATT: As you're watching this, from the
fume, a
small plume of black smoke goes
(whoosh).

138
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:55,064
LAURA and MARISHA: See?

139
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:58,864
MATT: And that cold nugget in the center
of your
chest is gone.

140
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,964
(cheering)

141
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,314
LAURA: It feels good, doesn't it?!

142
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,635
MARISHA: Doesn't it feel good?

143
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,114
TRAVIS: You fucking genius!

144
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,354
LAURA: It feels good!

145
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:10,454
(laughter)

146
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:13,864
TALIESIN: It was so expensive.

147
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,487
TRAVIS: Aw, come on!

148
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,187
TALIESIN: Oh, just throw the carpet in
there now,
why don't you?

149
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,194
MARISHA: Oh, Percival, that hurts.

150
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,313
MATT: Cassandra steps up to you and
takes your
head in her hands and forces
you to look at her

151
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:34,193
and goes, "Brother. We've all made
sacrifices for
this." She slaps you.

152
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,175
TALIESIN: (yelps)

153
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:41,285
MATT: Oh! That's a 21. 19 plus two.

154
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,613
SAM: He's held right now.

155
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,684
MARISHA: Still holding him in place.

156
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:49,019
LIAM: I hold my fist way up high to
Scanlan on
Grog's shoulder for a silent

157
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,893
little exploding fist bump.

158
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:56,785
MATT: And she looks to you and goes--
Cassandra
gives you a look to--

159
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:59,115
TALIESIN: You were never Mother's
favorite.

160
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,087
SAM: Let's not be petty.

161
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,416
TALIESIN: She told me!

162
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,035
SAM: Let's not be petty, Percy.

163
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:07,775
MARISHA: You sure you want to let him
go? You
sure? Did you hear what he just
said to you?

164
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:08,215
You sure?

165
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,047
MATT: It came out as (muffled angry
sounds).

166
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:13,326
MARISHA: I let it go.

167
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:17,876
MATT: Okay, your muscle control comes
back to you
and Cassandra is holding
your freshly slapped

168
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:25,081
face, gives you a look and goes,
"Brother. Let's go to our
people. Let's
tell them that for the first time in

169
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,787
"five years Whitestone is free."

170
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,658
TALIESIN: Oh god. Yeah. I'm letting it
go.

171
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:33,626
MATT: She reaches over and she takes
your arm in
her arm.

172
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,296
TALIESIN: Oh god.

173
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:39,257
MATT: She takes your arm in her arm and
begins
walking both of you back towards
the tunnels.

174
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:47,776
TALIESIN: That one was enchanted. Okay.
Two
enchantments. Yeah, all right.

175
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:52,741
MATT: And with that, we're going to go
ahead and take a
quick bathroom break.
Meet you guys back here in a

176
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,843
few minutes.

177
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,223
MARISHA: But you're still alive!

178
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,334
TALIESIN: I'm not alive!

179
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,107
LAURA: You're not controlled anymore!

180
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,607
[break]

181
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:23,000
MATT: Welcome back, folks! So. Let's go
ahead and
pick up where we left off. So,
as you guys return

182
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:31,119
to the undercroft of Whitestone,
Cassandra
carrying you, arm in arm. You
make your way up

183
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:40,560
through the stairs to the main base
floor of
Castle Whitestone. Are you guys
heading towards

184
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,721
your-- where are you heading from here?

185
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:47,851
MARISHA: I'm going to head straight for
the front
door and look in-- is there a
balcony on top?

186
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:51,100
MATT: You can check for the second floor
if you
want to.

187
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,768
LAURA: Overviews the city?

188
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:59,011
MATT: You have a pretty high view. It's
already
elevated on this platform, so
even from a ground-floor

189
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:01,813
area you can look down into the city.

190
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:02,974
TRAVIS: Front door.

191
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:07,354
MATT: Front door? All right, Grog walks
up to the
front door, being careful of
the scattered

192
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:12,534
caltrops you guys left there. The door
is still
ajar from where you left it. As
you step out and

193
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:21,793
look into the daylight, and it's at this
point
now, probably mid-afternoon,
pushing into evening.

194
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:26,724
You guys have been traveling underground
for quite
some time and taken a few
short rests, and have

195
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:30,504
had a lot of conflict and things happen.
So you
started at the start of the day.
You're now

196
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:34,142
pushing into towards dusk. But as you
open up and
look outside, with what
daylight is still there,

197
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:45,455
you see little plumes of smoke coming
from the far
city. Down the pathway that
leads up to Castle

198
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:56,535
Whitestone, you see about 70 to 100
armored
humanoids marching up towards
the front of the

199
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:57,763
castle.

200
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,254
SAM: Humanoids?

201
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,585
MATT: Bipedal.

202
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,063
TRAVIS: Can I pick up my caltrops?

203
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,197
MATT: You begin to pick up your
caltrops.

204
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:10,603
LAURA: I know what this is.

205
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:12,142
TRAVIS: Well, they're good guys.

206
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:14,504
SAM: No, it could be an undead army.

207
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:15,926
MATT: Make a perception check.

208
00:22:16,026 --> 00:22:19,584
LAURA: I know what this is. Do I need
roll
perception if I know what it is?

209
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,104
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say.

210
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:23,305
TRAVIS: Wow! 19 minus...

211
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:24,497
MARISHA: 20.

212
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:25,622
TALIESIN: 27.

213
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:26,796
SAM: Five.

214
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:27,896
LAURA: 15.

215
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:31,393
MATT: All right. As you guys get your
weapons at
the ready--

216
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,484
TALIESIN: 25, sorry. Did the math wrong.

217
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:44,976
MATT: 25, okay. Percy and Vax, you
notice the
people approaching, spattered
in mud and various

218
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:55,965
types of ichor or blood. As they get
closer, you
can see beneath the helmets:
tired human faces.

219
00:22:56,065 --> 00:23:01,754
Stepping up the side, weapons at the
ready. As
they approach the very front
of the line, you see

220
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:09,005
Keeper Yennen, equally exhausted,
stepping
forward, essentially ready to
storm the castle.

221
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:20,555
You see behind them as they approach a
scattered
cluster of broken corpses,
some human, some a

222
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:28,316
little less human. It looks like the
rebellion
army seems to have cut its way
through the

223
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:33,596
remaining defenders of Castle Whitestone
and are
making their way towards the
front of the castle.

224
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:43,755
As they get closer, they meet your gaze,
and the
front of the group draw their
weapons, and Yennen

225
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:51,351
steps forwards a little bit. "You there!
Percival."

226
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:53,185
TALIESIN: I step forward.

227
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:57,149
MATT: "Vox Machina. Are your wits about
you?"

228
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,346
TRAVIS: Yes?

229
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:00,446
MARISHA: Yes.

230
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:02,316
TALIESIN: The Briarwoods are dead.

231
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,974
MARISHA: It's true.

232
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:08,357
LIAM: Serpent's head has been cut off,
but there
is much to do.

233
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,685
MARISHA: Is it still cloudy?

234
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:15,196
MATT: It's a little cloudy. It's not
rainstorm
ready, but there's still sort

235
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:17,146
of an overcast feel.

236
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:24,799
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and at
third level,
because that's all I got
left, cast Skywrite

237
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:28,857
again, and throw up the de Rolo crest
once again
in the sky.

238
00:24:28,957 --> 00:24:36,084
MATT: Okay. As you begin to coalesce the
clouds
and the symbol and the shapes,
you see a bunch of

239
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:40,104
the soldiers look around and Yennen
steps forward
again towards you and
goes, reaching up holding

240
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:46,724
his holy symbol of Erathis to his chest,
he goes,
"Are you certain this is done?
Percival."

241
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:57,608
TALIESIN: There's still a great evil
beneath the
castle, but the Briarwoods
are no more.

242
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:09,356
MATT: He turns around, looks to his men
who are
all looking at him expectantly.
"Well, you heard

243
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:18,986
"the man. The Briarwoods are dead.
Whitestone is
free once more!" He looks
up to the sky as the

244
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:25,997
symbol finishes from Keyleth's spell.
"The de
Rolos are in power once again!"

245
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:35,449
At which point the entire crowd shouts
"yeah!"
Their weapons to the sky, and as
the shouts begin

246
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:42,019
to echo down into the valley of
Whitestone, you
can see little lights
begin to burn in the distance,

247
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,557
little notification lanterns that are
being lit
and set at windowtops, at the
top of the mountain,

248
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:53,796
and you can see this look of relief and
joy on
every soldier's face as they all
realize that the

249
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:59,617
death they were all marching to face is
no longer
a threat. Cassandra, at this
point, is still

250
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:05,888
standing behind you at your side, and
really for
the first time since all of
this went down

251
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:08,429
beneath, you see a smile on her face.

252
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:19,948
Yennen turns around again and approaches
you all.
(sighs) "I don't know what to
say. Well, come.

253
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:26,449
"There's much to discuss. Let us step
from this
foul place for the time being.
Men! Walk through,

254
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:29,078
"make sure it's clean." And the some of
the
soldiers--

255
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:30,178
MARISHA: No!

256
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:35,473
TALIESIN: There's still a matter of some
things
beneath the castle that we must
deal with first.

257
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:39,618
MARISHA: No one should be allowed in for
right
now, until we figure this out.

258
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:43,000
MATT: "Very well. Men, seal the doors,
seal the
entrances. Keep watch."

259
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,198
MARISHA: We really need to rest.

260
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:51,610
MATT: "Then come. You've certainly
earned it." And
he motions to a few of
the guards.

261
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,488
MARISHA: What time of day is it? Do we
have a
sense? Is the sun still up?

262
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:59,628
MATT: The sun's still up, but you can
see from the
light source and the
darkening of the sky and the

263
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:05,629
color pushing from a general white-grey.
It's
going a little more reddish-orange.

264
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:15,119
MARISHA: Before we take a rest, I'm
going to look
at Percy, and I'm going to
be like, I'll catch up

265
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:21,139
with you guys. I think the people need
to see the
sun. And I'm going to go into
my air elemental

266
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:29,910
form, go up into the sky above
Whitestone, and do
my Whirlwind ability
and start trying to just push

267
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,231
all of the clouds out of the way to let
the sun
in.

268
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:37,710
MATT: All right, as you guys begin--

269
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,201
LAURA: Oh, did she freeze?

270
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:41,919
SAM: She's frozen in a beautifully
surprised
expression.

271
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:44,059
MATT: She can still hear us.

272
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,510
LAURA: Oh, she can still hear us but
she's
frozen.

273
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,789
SAM: Surprise!

274
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:55,410
MATT: You guys begin to march down
towards the
city with the rest of the
army. A group of about

275
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,150
ten men stay behind just to guard the
castle. As
you make you way to the
northern side of

276
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:07,621
Whitestone and you enter the streets
again, you
can see families beginning to
walk out of their

277
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:14,450
homes in the streets. In the entirety of
your time
here in Whitestone, most folks
that didn't need to

278
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:20,566
be out in the open stayed indoors, and
you begin
to realize this seeming ghost
city was hiding a

279
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:26,590
lot more life and a lot more hope than
you had
expected, and you see families,
and children,

280
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:34,787
stepping out, and as you walk through
the streets
you can see the kids wave.
You meet eyes with some

281
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:37,150
of the possible widows, who mouth to
you, "Thank
you".

282
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,050
LIAM: Seeing that--

283
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:45,360
TALIESIN: Can we pass by the Alcove?

284
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,073
LIAM: Seeing that, I'm going to do the
buddy arm
around the shoulder and pull
my sister in close.

285
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:53,606
MATT: Okay.

286
00:28:53,706 --> 00:29:03,644
SAM: (clears throat) I walk up to a
particularly
handsome widow, and I say,
your husband--

287
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:07,971
LAURA: Pike is right here.

288
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:10,839
SAM: Oh. Your husband died for a good
cause,
thanks, bye.

289
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:12,939
(laughter)

290
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,989
TALIESIN: Pike is shocked. Pike is
shocked and
offended.

291
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:22,299
SAM: Why are you looking at me like
that, Pike?
Pike, stop it!

292
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:31,251
MATT: As you walk away, she looks really
confused
and clutches her chest in
horror for a moment as

293
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:35,460
one of the soldiers walking with you
steps by her
side, looking at you
curiously, and gives her a

294
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,891
kiss on the cheek. She goes, "Who was
that man?"

295
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:39,166
SAM: Oh, sorry.

296
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:46,929
TALIESIN: Can we-- definitely want to
go, let's stop
by the Alcove.

297
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:50,029
MATT: Okay. You eventually start making
your way
towards the Alcove as you

298
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,851
enter deeper into the city.

299
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,080
LIAM: Pike, you there? Can you hear us?

300
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,580
MARISHA: Have I cleared up enough of the
sky at
this point?

301
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,790
MATT: We're going to get to that right
now,
actually.

302
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,130
MARISHA: I want to get to that.

303
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,310
MATT: As you guys are stepping-- I'm
sorry, what?

304
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,521
SAM: No, it's okay.

305
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:06,341
MATT: Pushing further in you can see now
the
clouds beginning to dissipate, and
also for the

306
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:12,042
first time since you've been here you
see blue sky
directly above the city.
The vibrant

307
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:18,934
orange-red-purple colors of the sunset
now come
cascading along the city of
Whitestone, and

308
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:24,861
there's a collective (gasps), an inhale
and gasp
of awe from the soldiers and
the people alike as

309
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:31,132
this opens up above you. You begin to
walk past.
The Alcove's to your left, if
you wish to--

310
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,782
TALIESIN: I want to stop in.

311
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:39,094
MATT: Okay. As you start heading towards
the Alcove
you can see Jordana is
already out on the front

312
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:43,851
stoop looking up at the sky. She looks
over and
sees you. "Percival!"

313
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:45,251
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug.

314
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:50,732
MATT: It takes her by surprise at the
moment, and
then she gives in and

315
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,259
continues to give the hug back.

316
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,584
TALIESIN: This would not have been
possible
without your help. Thank you
for everything.

317
00:30:56,684 --> 00:31:08,731
MATT: "Of course." She leans into the
hug a little
bit, then nods and then
raises her head. "Did you

318
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:09,862
"see my father?"

319
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:14,242
TALIESIN: I have not. We have not
searched the
castle yet, though.

320
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:17,845
LAURA: We just left it? We haven't
searched the
castle?

321
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,452
MARISHA: We searched a little bit.

322
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:23,192
LAURA: But there could be live people in
there
when we sealed it?

323
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,864
TALIESIN: We don't know. It's not
airtight or
anything. I mean, they're
breathing.

324
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:29,100
SAM: Ripley's gone and also there's a
goliath on
the loose.

325
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:38,792
MATT: As you say this, Keeper Yennen
goes, "Not
anymore, there isn't. Follow
me."

326
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:40,692
ALL: Ooh.

327
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:44,003
SAM: Are there any young boys around?

328
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:48,501
MATT: He stops in his tracks and looks
over his
shoulder and goes, "What?"

329
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,833
SAM: I just need a young, fleet-footed
boy.

330
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:54,095
TRAVIS: See, the last time I asked for a
young boy
people gave me shit, too.

331
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:56,955
TALIESIN: No, we're going to give him
shit.
There's no problem here.

332
00:31:56,687 --> 00:32:00,304
MATT: He slowly turns away and keeps
walking
forward.

333
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:04,065
SAM: Or a girl! No, wait, that sounds
weird.

334
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:11,164
TRAVIS: Yep. You can't say it in a right
way. It's
impossible. Innocent request.

335
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:15,664
MATT: The people have begun following
behind your
procession towards the
center of the city.

336
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:18,302
LIAM: Bring me your smallest, most
helpless
child.

337
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,402
(laughter)

338
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:24,828
ASHLEY: Oh god.

339
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:28,955
TRAVIS: That's fucked up.

340
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:30,984
TALIESIN: That's going to explode.

341
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,724
SAM: All right. Show us what you want to
show us,
Yennen.

342
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:40,334
MATT: You see behind you soldiers
reuniting with
their families, friends
gathering in the streets,

343
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:44,274
and the people of Whitestone are now
beginning to
join the sides of your
procession towards the

344
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:50,669
center of the Sun Square in the middle
of
Whitestone. As you crest into the
outskirts of the

345
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:56,315
square, Yennen gives a couple of
whispered orders
to a couple of the
soldiers, who rush off. You can

346
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:59,255
see people are now gathering in the
center and
there's actually people

347
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:00,095
gathering around the Sun Tree.

348
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:08,145
As they all step to the Sun Tree, it's a
little
quiet, and Keeper Yennen reaches
up and pulls his

349
00:33:08,245 --> 00:33:16,946
holy symbol of Erathis again, looks up
to the tree
and looks back at the rest
of you and goes, "For

350
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:28,153
"generations, it was those of the Zenith
who looked
over this tree and these
people here, and it was

351
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:40,295
"by the evil that once held foot in this
town that
Father Reynal, the last of his
line, was slain. We

352
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:48,636
"will work to find those who wish to
take up the
mantle to clean and rebuild
the Zenith, the

353
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:57,196
"pinnacle of Pelor's grace here in
Whitestone. But
until that I, Yennen,
swear to make this tree's

354
00:33:57,296 --> 00:34:09,197
"safety my responsibility. This symbol
of hope,
this center of the crest of
your family has held

355
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,880
"the slivers of light in our hearts for
a very long
time.

356
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:30,026
"Let us all take a moment and thank the
heroes who
made this freedom possible:
to the strong mountain

357
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:50,126
"of joy and bravery, Grog. To the
gentle, to the
kind, to the just soul,
Pike. To the swift of bow,

358
00:34:52,657 --> 00:35:01,938
"keen of sight, and the most adorable
creature to
accompany her--" as Trinket
steps forward and

359
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:20,438
nuzzles your side-- "Trinket. By the
agility, by
the cunning, by the loyalty
of Vax. By the

360
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:40,677
"cleverness, by the wit, and the strange
interests
of Scanlan. By the honesty, by
the nature and

361
00:35:45,599 --> 00:36:04,199
"connection with the world, and the
wonder of
Keyleth. And by the strength
of blood, and the

362
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:10,103
"willingness to sacrifice-- "

363
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:12,539
ASHLEY: (mic bump)

364
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,657
MATT: "Pardon me."

365
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,757
(laughter)

366
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:35,905
MATT: Damn it.

367
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:38,434
SAM: Start that one again?

368
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,814
LIAM: It's still very beautiful.

369
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,272
MARISHA: So beautiful.

370
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:48,670
TALIESIN: Two years on a sitcom. I can
hold this
all day.

371
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,770
(laughter)

372
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,719
MATT: God damn it.

373
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,871
LAURA: Percival's just waiting for his
introduction.

374
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,636
LIAM: To the stone-cold motherfucker on
air.

375
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:18,170
MATT: "To the return of those valiants
we once
thought lost, and those who rise
up to restore the

376
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:30,431
"joy of these people. Percival. May we
raise our
weapons, our glasses, and our
children, who accept

377
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:40,532
"this future to rebuild. Raise to Vox
Machina.
Hyah!" And everyone raises as
one loud--

378
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:45,639
TRAVIS: Yeah! Vox Machina!

379
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:52,091
MATT: As the sun slowly sets, the light
coming
through in beautiful colors now.
You see what was

380
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:59,971
once a very bleak town suddenly be
renewed with a
spectrum of new accents.
You begin to hear music

381
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:04,266
being played, as now the celebration
begins with
the sun's setting. Folks are
turning this into a

382
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,811
full celebration now. People are
starting to bring
out food and--

383
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,160
MARISHA: Block party!

384
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,035
MATT: (laughs) You feel this sense that
this is
the first time in a long time
the people have ever

385
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:25,632
really been allowed to be happy about
something.
And the energy is infectious
in itself. As the

386
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:30,956
celebration begins, though, Yennen puts
up his
hand and people begin to slow and
calm as

387
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:42,904
men begin to bring forward two
individuals in
chains. One of which you
see is a half-orc female

388
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:49,142
in dark brown leather armor. She is
chained and
thrown onto her knees onto
the ground, and she

389
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:53,772
spits; you can see there's a few cuts
across her
face and she looks dirty. And
right next to her,

390
00:38:53,872 --> 00:39:02,859
taking four men to do so, a goliath
who's bruised
is also thrown onto his
knees and they're both

391
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,151
just held at that place.

392
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:14,176
Yennen says, "The two remaining new
nobles, given
power here as they aided
the Briarwoods in taking

393
00:39:14,276 --> 00:39:25,669
"this city. We have Duke--" which the
people spit
at the sound of the name--
"Goran Vedmeyer. And

394
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:34,252
"Countess Jazna Graben. You have been
found guilty
of treason against this
town, of the

395
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:42,309
"responsibility of many lives lost,
innocent. And
for furthering the plans
of the evil that has

396
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:53,090
"oppressed us so long. I would wish that
you, the
ones who freed us, deliver the
judgment."

397
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,134
TRAVIS: (laughs)

398
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,462
LAURA: Come on.

399
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:04,292
TRAVIS: No, that sounds fair. I've known
to
preside over many legal matters in my
time as

400
00:40:04,392 --> 00:40:07,773
Judgeface of Northwind.

401
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,604
LIAM: Define "legal."

402
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:11,121
MARISHA: Define "Judgeface."

403
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,860
TRAVIS: It would just baffle all of you.
It's all
right.

404
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,162
SAM: Grog, if I may. I can assist you in
this, if
you'd like.

405
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:23,651
TRAVIS: Oh, why of course, Sub-judge
Scanlan.

406
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:29,982
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Percival, this is
your
kingdom, so if you--

407
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,202
TALIESIN: I leave it to you.

408
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,292
LAURA: No.

409
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:33,779
TRAVIS: Yes. Even better.

410
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:43,582
SAM: These two have done much violence
to this
place. They represent all that
is evil.

411
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:51,241
MATT: "Wait." And Goran, who is now down
on the
ground, looks up at you and goes,
"I know you."

412
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:53,782
SAM: Never saw you before, friend.

413
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:56,433
TALIESIN: This is what I really wanted
to see.

414
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:59,985
SAM: You have a lovely house, by the
way. Or had
one.

415
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,085
(laughter)

416
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:05,063
MATT: Spits on the ground at your feet.

417
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:18,617
SAM: Might need a new roofer. Anyway. In
a show of
grace and to demonstrate our
new hope that we have

418
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:22,292
for this place, I suggest that we don't
kill these
two.

419
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:23,392
TRAVIS: What?

420
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:27,803
SAM: But rather force them to help
rebuild the
place that they helped
destroy.

421
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:32,581
LAURA: In chains. Very heavy chains.

422
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:39,323
SAM: One of them at least is extremely
strong. The
other one must have some
sort of skill.

423
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:45,722
MATT: She for the first time looks up
with this
gnarly toothy grin. You can
see these partially

424
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:53,003
broken and jagged teeth in her mouth,
and she
goes, "Come closer. I've never
tasted gnome."

425
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:54,850
SAM: Okay, so maybe we'll kill her.

426
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,491
LAURA: Would you rather die?

427
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,373
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons did these
two have on
them?

428
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:07,860
MATT: The men look about themselves and
Yennen,
"Not entirely certain. However,
she has been known

429
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,193
"to carry a quiver or two, and this one
here wields
a blade as long as his
body."

430
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:21,743
LIAM: The Briarwoods are broken and
gone. You can
die today, or you can take
your licks and help

431
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:29,192
rebuild this city. No one is here to
protect you
or save you. You can work
hard, start again.

432
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:35,515
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With
advantage,
based on their current
circumstance.

433
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:40,754
LIAM: Intimidation, you said, or
persuasion?

434
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:42,628
MATT: Whichever you'd prefer.

435
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,212
LIAM: It's average, it's 13.

436
00:42:45,312 --> 00:43:01,285
MATT: 13? Okay. You can see the goliath,
Vedmeyer,
lowers his head. "I accept.
Jazna?"

437
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:15,746
She looks over. "It seems you lack what
has kept
me alive all these years: a
spine. Kill me. I'd

438
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,385
"rather not stay at your beck and call."

439
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:19,485
TRAVIS: Okay.

440
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:20,327
TALIESIN: Grog.

441
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:23,254
TRAVIS: I reach over and I take out my
greataxe
and I aim it for her neck.

442
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,262
MATT: Okay, as, did you swing or just
aim it?

443
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:29,138
TRAVIS: Yeah, swing for the neck.
Beheading-style.

444
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:34,838
MATT: Make a strength check.

445
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:37,409
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

446
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:39,509
(laughter)

447
00:43:41,225 --> 00:43:44,276
LIAM: Merry Christmas, Travis.

448
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:50,024
MATT: As you pull the axe out and you
walk
alongside with it almost like a
cane,

449
00:43:50,124 --> 00:43:51,775
look down at her--

450
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,326
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a cane.

451
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:58,996
MATT: (impact noise) And with speed and
deftness
where no one sees the blade
make contact, there is

452
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:06,825
a moment where the head just drifts off
the form,
leaving the base, the throat
cleanly cleaven.

453
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:15,555
Cloven, if you will, sorry. There's a
moment of
pause before the blood begins
to pour from the

454
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:21,474
wound, it was so fast and so immediate,
and the
body just slumps forward.
There's a gasp in the

455
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:27,787
crowd suddenly, and then a cheer as the
locals now
see one of the people that
probably oppressed,

456
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:32,267
tortured, and killed many of their folk
now lies
on the ground, killed.

457
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:40,476
TRAVIS: I look at the axe and look at
the blood
covering it and I look over at
Duke Gonad and I

458
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:46,500
say, so, where are you from and how did
you come
to be in the service of the
Briarwoods?

459
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,395
MATT: "I was hired in Wildmount."

460
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:53,821
TRAVIS: Do I know where that is?

461
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:59,623
MATT: You don't. You've heard it said
before.
You've heard it mentioned, but
you have no idea

462
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:00,723
where it is.

463
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:03,937
TRAVIS: Right, the holy lands of the
sacred-- all
right.

464
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,904
SAM: Are you okay, your honor?

465
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:11,427
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you for-- I am quite
tired.
Would you like to take it from
here?

466
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:12,558
SAM: No.

467
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:19,509
TALIESIN: While we always must dispense
our
justice, this is now a town of mercy
as well. And

468
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:28,971
I will expect nothing less from all of
us than to
give what we have lacked for
so long. Duke.

469
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:31,348
SAM: Let hers be the last blood shed.

470
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:35,735
TALIESIN: Earn your life again.

471
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:45,329
MATT: He nods and looks down. You can't
tell if
it's shame or just defeat, but
his shoulders slump

472
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:52,768
and that little bit of fire that was in
him when
he arrived is broken. The men
look at you, they

473
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:56,628
get your nod and they lift the chains
and pull
them off while a couple of the
men pick up the

474
00:45:56,568 --> 00:46:01,323
body of the half-orc woman and pull them
out of
the crowd. The music swells up
once again, and the

475
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:06,001
celebration continues without a beat.
You can now
see tables being brought out
to the center and

476
00:46:06,101 --> 00:46:11,768
glasses are set about and drinks are
being poured
as a giant central table
right at the base of the

477
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,119
Sun Tree is set for you.

478
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:20,250
TALIESIN: They've just had this shit in
a
Tupperware container, like in those
big bins in

479
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,888
the back for the last five years with
like
duct-tape lids.

480
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:28,719
MATT: It's not a grand meal, there
hasn't been a
lot of time to prepare for
it, but basically what

481
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:33,805
it looks like is whoever is preparing
dinner or
whatever food was readily
available, they're just

482
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:36,985
bringing it out. It's more of like a
share-with-whoever's-there type effort.

483
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:37,939
MARISHA: Aw, it's a potluck.

484
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:38,950
MATT: Kind of.

485
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,850
SAM: I find a young boy.

486
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:46,479
MATT: Yes, Scanlan?

487
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:52,219
SAM: Or a soldier, and I give him 15
gold and I
say,

488
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:58,244
for the love of god, find me a fucking
beret.

489
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:05,439
MATT: "All right, sir." And the boy
takes the gold
and rushes off, looking
in his hands at the boon

490
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:12,357
he's been given by this
practically-same-height
man. They don't
see gnomes here very often; it's

491
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,130
been very confusing.

492
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:20,831
TALIESIN: I want to take some time to
tell Keeper
Yennen about what is beneath
the tree and let him

493
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,431
start to macerate some theories on what
to do--

494
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:27,024
TRAVIS: Macerate? That's a big word.

495
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:29,604
MATT: After you finish this
conversation, he sits
there and--

496
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,367
TALIESIN: It's a word for big name.
Thank you. Do
it.

497
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:43,110
MATT: A few moments pass before the boy
returns,
in his hand a (singing)
raspberry beret, the kind

498
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,150
you find in a secondhand store.

499
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,621
SAM: Oh, feels good.

500
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,361
LAURA: Make it look cooler on him,
because he made
it look dorky.

501
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,001
TALIESIN: It's a beret. I don't think he
made it
dorky. I think it comes with

502
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:55,310
that already sewn in.

503
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,661
LAURA: There it is, looks good. It looks
good,
Scanlan.

504
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:04,251
SAM: Thank you, young boy. Whatever your
name was.
What was your name, young boy?

505
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,621
MARISHA: Make it good.

506
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,421
MATT: "Randall?"

507
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:13,728
SAM: Thank you, Randall. You've made me
a very
happy small man.

508
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:15,471
MATT: And he brings you the change.

509
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:21,752
SAM: Oh no, keep the change, it's all
right. Go
buy yourself a goose. The
biggest goose in town.

510
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,852
(laughter)

511
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:26,743
TALIESIN: With a beret.

512
00:48:26,843 --> 00:48:32,614
MATT: And he darts off excitedly. You
catch him
out of the corner of your eye
like stealing a swig

513
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:33,714
of beer--

514
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,540
SAM: Brandon Gilmore, that was his young
name.

515
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,762
LAURA: Brandon Gilmore?

516
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:37,871
SAM: Yes.

517
00:48:37,971 --> 00:48:47,103
MATT: Thank you, Brandon. So after you
finish
regaling this tale to Keeper
Yennen, let's see if

518
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,993
I have a proper song for celebration.

519
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,718
TRAVIS: I'm doing my best to empty the
cask of ale
into the town patrons and
myself.

520
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:58,761
TALIESIN: I don't know if that's-- less
aviary than
celebratory.

521
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:00,237
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately.

522
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:06,332
MARISHA: Can Keyleth go over and check
out the Sun
Tree?

523
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:11,788
MATT: Sure, as you're walking over
there, we'll
finish this conversation
here. Yennen nods to

524
00:49:11,888 --> 00:49:22,552
himself and goes, "That is
disconcerting. I'll
reach out to a few
of my contacts, see who we can

525
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:30,396
"bring here to inspect it. I may go down
tomorrow
myself and have a look. Is it
safe?"

526
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:38,711
TALIESIN: No. There are traps. We've
marked them.
It's also disturbing.

527
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:48,364
MATT: "All right. I'll bring a trusted
team down,
then. If there's anyone you
know who has vast

528
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:53,534
"historical or arcane knowledge, I would
recommend
possibly having them come take
a look as well.

529
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:55,765
"Unfortunately, I'm rather limited in my
teachings."

530
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:56,865
SAM: Pike?

531
00:49:56,902 --> 00:49:58,311
LAURA: Allura?

532
00:49:58,411 --> 00:49:59,863
SAM: But she's not in town.

533
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,673
TALIESIN: We can send word.

534
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:03,193
MATT: "Please do."

535
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:05,343
LAURA: What about Ryndarien?

536
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:06,822
MARISHA: Eskil?

537
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:09,454
MATT: There was Eskil Ryndarien, the
archmage in
Westruun.

538
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:13,093
LIAM: Yes. Either, both.

539
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:20,210
MATT: "Good, good, yes, anyone at all.
Maybe I'll
be able to glean something,
but unfortunately most

540
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:32,160
"of our books were confiscated when the
town was
taken. However, I appreciate
that, and at least

541
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:38,418
"for the time being, there doesn't seem
to be any
dead rising from the grave."

542
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,503
SAM: If I may, Percy, may I make a
suggestion?

543
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:44,683
TALIESIN: Is it going to be throwing the
rest of
my guns into a pit of acid?

544
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:46,484
SAM: No, but it will be spending some of
your
kingdom's money.

545
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:49,144
TALIESIN: Replacing the guns that you
threw into a
pit of acid.

546
00:50:48,993 --> 00:50:50,393
SAM: Let's not talk about the guns.

547
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,911
TALIESIN: I really can't think of what
else I'd
want to talk about. Please, go
ahead.

548
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:57,493
SAM: If most of their books have been
taken from
them, perhaps we could use
some of the treasury to

549
00:50:57,593 --> 00:50:59,606
build a library.

550
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:03,426
TALIESIN: That is not a terrible idea,
and it's
possible that the books are
still within the

551
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:03,735
castle.

552
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:07,235
LAURA: It's possible that the Briarwoods
have
hoarded all of them. In fact, we
might find

553
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:09,453
something about this entity inside the
castle.

554
00:51:09,553 --> 00:51:15,934
TALIESIN: And we do need to build three
new
structures where the lords' houses
were, and I

555
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:19,504
find the idea of rebuilding those
mansions to be a
bit distasteful.

556
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:26,899
SAM: Perhaps we could even name one of
the
libraries Gilmore's Glorious Books.

557
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:30,983
TRAVIS: Set up a satellite chain?

558
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:40,975
TALIESIN: We will discuss it. It's got a
ring, I
will admit.

559
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:43,155
MATT: While you guys are having this
conversation--

560
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:45,805
LIAM: Oh, I was just going to add to
that, I'm
sure the man can help

561
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:48,574
in this city's time of need.

562
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:51,694
TALIESIN: You were doing something, as
well.

563
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:55,554
MATT: Yes. Keyleth, at this point, as
you've
walked away from this
conversation, you approach

564
00:51:54,053 --> 00:52:02,076
the Sun Tree. It stands there with a
little bit of
light as the sun's just
now passing over the

565
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:08,753
distant mountain range that surrounds
this valley.
The sky's growing more
purple and dark blue. But

566
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:12,813
now lights have been lit and lanterns
have been
brought to the center, you can
see the Sun Tree in

567
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:14,290
full before you.

568
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:21,415
MARISHA: I reach up and I put my hand on
it and I
cast Commune With Nature. Do I
gather anything?

569
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:23,995
MATT: What does Commune With Nature do
in full?

570
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:25,775
TALIESIN: It lets you commune with
nature.

571
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:26,867
MARISHA: Essentially.

572
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,647
MATT: Oh, look at that, first page I
open up to.
Okay.

573
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,627
TALIESIN: It's like a DM version of
natural 20.

574
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,434
LAURA: It is. Except he does it all the
time.

575
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:37,974
MATT: Okay, so which do you want to
know, of all
the things that you can
choose from?

576
00:52:37,315 --> 00:52:39,427
MARISHA: Oh, what are my choices?

577
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:43,447
MATT: You can choose from terrain or
bodies of
water in the vicinity;
prevalent plants, minerals,

578
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:46,846
animals, or peoples; powerful
celestials, fey,
fiends, or elementals
or undead within 300 feet of

579
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:51,502
it-- or sorry, within three miles of it;
influence
from other planes of
existence; or buildings.

580
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:57,029
MARISHA: The influence of other planes
of
existence sounds promising.

581
00:52:57,129 --> 00:53:02,308
MATT: Okay, you gain three facts. So,
first off,
you notice as you touch the
Sun Tree and you cast

582
00:53:02,408 --> 00:53:10,035
the spell, whereas previously you felt
just dead
wood and a lack of any
presence, there is a small

583
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:12,536
seed of life in the tree once again.

584
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:14,906
MARISHA: That's good.

585
00:53:15,006 --> 00:53:22,376
MATT: We'll call that the first one, as
a given.
As you inquire about any other
planes of

586
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:40,076
existence, you do sense that at least
some element
nearby relates to a realm
of shadow.

587
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:43,306
LAURA: That's obvious.

588
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:45,368
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, okay.

589
00:53:45,468 --> 00:53:47,388
MATT: And what's the third one you want
to know?

590
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:49,787
MARISHA: Oh, I get a choice?

591
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:50,911
MATT: Yep.

592
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:58,287
MARISHA: I didn't know I had a choice.

593
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:02,307
MATT: You don't have to ask anything
else if you
don't want to, if you got
everything you wanted.

594
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:15,496
MARISHA: I want to know if-- god, so
many options.
Is it going to be a good
growing season this

595
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:20,697
spring? Crops going to be good? It's
going to be a
good harvest moon?

596
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:23,157
LAURA: Ask how it's feeling, can you ask
how it's
feeling?

597
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,888
MARISHA: How's it feeling? Can I ask the
tree how
it's feeling, can I be like,
"Hey tree. How are

598
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:27,928
"you doing today?"

599
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:29,368
MATT: That is very Keyleth.

600
00:54:29,468 --> 00:54:32,668
MARISHA: You doing all right? How do you
feel
between all this, about all this?

601
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:33,704
MATT: You sense--

602
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:34,619
SAM: Hey, boo.

603
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,688
MARISHA: Hey, boo.

604
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:45,624
MATT: You sense weariness, like
something very old
that has been asleep
for a very long time has

605
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:47,157
woken up.

606
00:54:47,257 --> 00:54:49,001
MARISHA: Does it feel positive?

607
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:50,478
MATT: Positive.

608
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,578
MARISHA: Okay.

609
00:54:51,604 --> 00:55:03,558
MATT: The Sun Tree, seemingly kept at
bay, locked
away, what bit of its life
force it managed to

610
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:10,184
maintain had been contained for so long
and is now
finally free.

611
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:15,469
MARISHA: Can I just say, good morning,
old
friend.

612
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:21,098
MATT: You sense the tree saying, "The
sun just
set. It's not morning."

613
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:27,259
MARISHA: I go, oh shit. And then I turn
to Percy
and I say, the tree talked to
me.

614
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,900
TALIESIN: In that ancient way that trees
talk.

615
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,938
MARISHA: You just had a smoke monster
you were
talking to, is it that hard to
believe?

616
00:55:36,038 --> 00:55:38,594
MATT: (Ent voice) It's... not...
morning...

617
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:39,989
TALIESIN: Thank you.

618
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:45,860
LIAM: I watched her walk up to the tree
and I
followed her--

619
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,069
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh no.

620
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:48,169
LAURA: Here we go.

621
00:55:48,252 --> 00:55:52,789
LIAM: Here we go. I follow her up and I
don't say
anything, but I see one hand
on the tree and

622
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:54,121
without saying anything--

623
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:56,778
TRAVIS: I walk up behind Vax and I pants
him.

624
00:55:56,878 --> 00:55:58,119
LAURA: Yes!

625
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:00,699
TRAVIS: And I grab the back of his
collar and pull
backwards.

626
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:01,797
SAM: That's the revenge.

627
00:56:01,897 --> 00:56:05,066
LIAM: Are you going to roll anything?

628
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,841
MATT: Okay. So.

629
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:09,688
LIAM: I'm not sure what he did though.
Pantsing?

630
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:12,508
TRAVIS: I grabbed your pants and I
pulled them
down to your ankles.

631
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,710
LIAM: But what's the part about the
collar?

632
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:17,810
TRAVIS: I grabbed the back of your neck
and pulled
you backwards with your pants
around your ankles.

633
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,350
LIAM: Okay. He's got to roll, but if it
happens,
it happens.

634
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:27,079
MATT: Right. I would consider this a
grapple
check. So it's your athletics
versus your

635
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,779
acrobatics.

636
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:31,350
LAURA: What about the pantsing? Is that
included?

637
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,541
MATT: That is the pantsing.

638
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:34,803
TRAVIS: 20, plus--

639
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:36,633
MATT: Wait, natural 20?

640
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:41,218
TRAVIS: No, 19 plus-- 26. My athletics
is plus
seven.

641
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:43,080
LIAM: I rolled a 32.

642
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,765
TRAVIS: Damn it.

643
00:56:45,865 --> 00:56:53,611
MATT: As you reach out and are about to
grasp the
sides, he leaps straight up in
the air and then

644
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:59,081
lands a foot in front of you. You grab
nothing and
see him glance over his
shoulder and tsk-tsk.

645
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:00,830
LIAM: I knew that was going to happen.

646
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:05,080
TRAVIS: That's all right. It could've
been now.
It'll just be worse later.

647
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,591
SAM: Nice try, Grog.

648
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,668
LIAM: You already took my left nut off
my body.

649
00:57:09,768 --> 00:57:15,286
TRAVIS: Oh, please. That was but
appetizers for the
main course, my
friend.

650
00:57:15,386 --> 00:57:20,570
LIAM: All right, so that's challenge
number one,
now challenge number two.
So, I still don't say

651
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:26,713
anything besides (inhale) as I jump to
the side
really fast to not loose my
breeches. And she's

652
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:32,183
got one hand on the tree, and I just
quietly, with
her free hand and my free
hand, try to lace my

653
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:33,677
fingers with hers.

654
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:34,777
MATT: Against the tree?

655
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,504
LAURA: Oh my gosh, you guys are
boyfriend and
girlfriend now.

656
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:43,182
MATT: As you finish your awkward
it's-not-morning
conversation with the
essence of the Sun Tree--

657
00:57:43,282 --> 00:57:45,191
TALIESIN: It's morning somewhere.

658
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,432
MARISHA: As I'm talking, good morning,
Sun
Tree.

659
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:55,737
MATT: You feel a strange alien hand in
your left
free hand for a moment,
unexpectedly.

660
00:57:55,837 --> 00:57:57,677
MARISHA: I jump and I yank away
instinctually.

661
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:01,641
MATT: Okay, she pulls away from it and
looks over
her shoulder with a bit of
surprise and sudden

662
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:02,836
horror.

663
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:06,231
LIAM: I shrug and look.

664
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:17,012
MARISHA: I was just talking to the tree.
It talked
back.

665
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:22,512
LIAM: I don't say anything.

666
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,133
(long pause)

667
00:58:31,672 --> 00:58:33,814
MARISHA: (giggling) Everyone is hiding.

668
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,592
SAM: I'm giving them privacy.

669
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:38,332
LAURA: You get privacy. It's your
moment.

670
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:42,096
MATT: So? Vax just stands there, not
saying
anything, just looking at you.

671
00:58:42,196 --> 00:58:46,996
LIAM: I already said it.

672
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:52,444
MATT: Don't look at them.

673
00:58:56,769 --> 00:59:07,769
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm
really
confused.

674
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:23,883
LIAM: Vax says, all right. And walks
off.

675
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:47,556
MARISHA: Wait. I'd be lying if I said
often at
night when I go to sleep, your
face isn't the last

676
00:59:50,964 --> 01:00:07,564
thing that crosses my mind. But with the
weight of
the world and the weight of
the

677
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:27,507
contact-embarrassment from our fellow
party,
currently, it's hard to focus on.
(hesitantly) You

678
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:44,221
said that when you were near death. We
say a lot
of things when we're near
death. How do I know

679
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:48,070
that's what you were truly feeling?

680
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,773
LIAM: I didn't say it out loud, I just
thought
it.

681
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:55,351
MATT: No, you told her.

682
01:00:55,451 --> 01:01:01,360
MARISHA: Oh yeah, no, you said that out
loud.
Yeah, no, that wasn't in your
head.

683
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:21,735
LIAM: I wore a mask for a long time,
where I grew
up. And I'm not going to do
that anymore. I'll wait.

684
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:24,635
MARISHA: Wait?

685
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:28,822
LIAM: For you.

686
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:53,721
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know what else to
say right
now. I'm really tired. Really
tired. I think

687
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:14,323
there's also a part of me that's just
afraid.

688
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:29,814
LIAM: I feel like I'm going to get
pantsed by a
goliath at any moment.
Don't do anything. Don't

689
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:41,637
change anything. I haven't lied. I've
told the
truth. If you'll have me, I'm
yours. If you don't

690
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:52,546
want me, I understand. And that's all
there is to
say. And then I actually
walk off.

691
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:53,858
MATT: Okay.

692
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:56,405
MARISHA: I stay by the tree.

693
01:02:56,505 --> 01:03:03,969
MATT: Okay. As this is happening and he
walks off,
you guys are there at the
table, just now noticing

694
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:11,205
the both of them have been missing. You
see
Keyleth, stunned, standing by the
Sun Tree as

695
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:18,375
Keeper Yennen approaches you once again
and goes,
"My friends. We have a lot of
work to do and it

696
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:28,594
"would not be fair for me to assume, as
you've
already done so much for us, but
it has been a

697
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:34,764
"while since we've had much to celebrate
in this
town, and this evening seems a
fine

698
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:49,896
"improvisational event. But we have two
weeks until
the Winter's Crest festival
would be happening

699
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:58,816
"here in Whitestone, something we have
not
celebrated in near five years. I
would just ask,

700
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:03,184
"should you be interested, if you would
wish to
stay with us these next couple
of weeks to help us

701
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:14,345
"rebuild and perhaps aid in preparing
the first
real shining moment in
Whitestone's history since

702
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:16,346
"you were gone."

703
01:04:16,446 --> 01:04:17,536
LAURA: Percival?

704
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,036
TALIESIN: I would be very grateful.

705
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,306
LAURA: We're here.

706
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:21,837
TALIESIN: We shall.

707
01:04:21,937 --> 01:04:23,516
MATT: Cassandra nods, as well.

708
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:36,401
LAURA: Keeper, may I ask for a small
request?
Could you maybe send a
wonderfully worded letter

709
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:44,337
to Uriel and let him know how we saved
the day and
how much you love us?

710
01:04:44,437 --> 01:04:55,926
MATT: He looks very confused. "I imagine
that
could be-- I assume that could be
done, yes."

711
01:04:56,026 --> 01:05:00,608
LAURA: That would be wonderful. Make
sure you
mention how terrible the
Briarwoods were and how

712
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:05,477
Vox Machina saved the day. Truly saved
it--

713
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:08,688
SAM: We can write it for you if you just
want to
sign it at the bottom.

714
01:05:08,788 --> 01:05:13,486
LIAM: That guy's going to wake up this
morning and
go, "oh, I'm an asshole."

715
01:05:13,586 --> 01:05:16,516
LAURA: Please? Yes, that would be
wonderful.

716
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,497
MATT: "All right. It'll be done."

717
01:05:18,597 --> 01:05:19,597
LAURA: Thank you.

718
01:05:19,674 --> 01:05:20,674
TRAVIS: Facepalm.

719
01:05:20,768 --> 01:05:23,847
LIAM: "Aw, what was I thinking. Oh."

720
01:05:23,947 --> 01:05:28,626
MATT: And so as the rest of you join in
the
merriment, or whatever else you wish
to do for the

721
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:35,106
evening, looking about post-sunset as
night
descends on Whitestone, to the
first clear sky

722
01:05:35,206 --> 01:05:44,177
since you've arrived. To the first
evening where
you can hear smiles,
cheers, and laughter, we'll

723
01:05:44,277 --> 01:05:47,039
pick up next week with the Winter's
Crest festival
in Whitestone.

724
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:49,139
(cheering)

725
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:53,719
LAURA: You should've kissed her, it was
the
perfect moment!

726
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:54,897
LIAM: I already did it.

727
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:56,597
LAURA: No but it was the perfect moment!

728
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:57,998
LIAM: You don't want it to happen
anyway.

729
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,110
LAURA: I don't care, this is out of
character! It
would have been the
perfect moment!

730
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:01,996
LIAM: I never said I was smart.

731
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:04,818
MATT: It makes for fun drama. That was
crazy.

732
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:06,869
TRAVIS: How am I going to beat your
acrobatics?

733
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:07,992
LIAM: You are not.

734
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:17,335
ZAC: So we gotta get ready for Critmas.
So we're
going to go offline and back up
so we can make

735
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:21,529
sure we get this episode uploaded to you
guys on
Monday. The longer the video,
the longer it takes

736
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:25,879
to transcode and sometimes makes it take
longer to
get up, so we'll be going
offline and then

737
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:27,329
right back up for Critmas, guys.

738
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:28,619
LAURA: Yay!

739
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,275
MATT: See you back here in just a few
minutes,
guys. Don't leave. We'll be
here!
