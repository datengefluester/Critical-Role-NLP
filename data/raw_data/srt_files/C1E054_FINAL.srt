1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,698
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,698 --> 00:00:11,489
get together and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Tonight,
apologies for the slight technical issues, but

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:15,644
we're back and we're going to be playing through
tonight's adventure. Before that gets started,

4
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:20,812
let's go ahead and get through a couple of quick
announcements. First and foremost, it's our third

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,496
week of our Loot Crate sponsorship. Thank you very
much.

6
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:25,319
(cheering)

7
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,730
MATT: Thank you for your interest in our show and
our audience, so for those of you who are

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,820
interested, Loot Crate is a really cool service
where once a month they bring you themed boxes

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,221
that have mystery contents within that are part of
that theme. All generally pop culture and

10
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,261
geek-centric.

11
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,284
LAURA: Taliesin, you're so loud!

12
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,630
MATT: Taliesin, quiet!

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,220
SAM: Shut up, Taliesin. Jesus.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,248
(laughter)

15
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:48,529
TRAVIS: Stop masturbating during the
announcements.

16
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,901
LAURA: It's so loud. What are you doing?

17
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,282
TALIESIN: I think I hit my microphone.

18
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:56,548
SAM: Don't worry. You're not an audio
professional.

19
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:02,580
MATT: That's okay. At least it wasn't during a
very climactic and important emotional moment in

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,518
the game.

21
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:04,786
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, that's right.

22
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:06,217
ASHLEY: You're welcome!

23
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:14,904
MATT: (laughs) Anyway, yeah. Loot Crate's awesome.
We've gone with it for years. They send mystery

24
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:18,570
items that are all geek and pop culture-related.
They're a lot of fun, and if you go to their

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,644
website at www.LootCrate.com/criticalrole and
check it out. If you like it and you get a

26
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:30,646
subscription, you can use criticalrole-- one word--
as a promo code to get $3 off a subscription.

27
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:34,391
SAM: I'm wearing some of the stuff from the crate
right now.

28
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,781
TRAVIS: And they've got a power crate coming out.

29
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,724
LAURA: David Bowie! Labyrinth!

30
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,259
TRAVIS: They have an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt.

31
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,946
MARISHA: That's pretty dope.

32
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:45,383
LAURA: Is that giving something away? I feel like
we gave spoilers.

33
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:48,342
LIAM: It was already Periscoped.

34
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,044
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Never mind.

35
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,866
MATT: That would be nice in the box. We're good?
We didn't waste it?

36
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,455
LIAM: What's in the box?

37
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,116
ASHLEY: (singing) A dick in a box.

38
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:04,040
MATT: I hope there is no dick in a box as part
of this service. Or perhaps I guess you do,

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,091
depending on-- that's a whole different
box service.

40
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:10,187
MARISHA: If there is, you should call your local
post office.

41
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,017
(laughter)

42
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:16,601
MATT: That's a love box membership. Anyway, so!
Also, once again, I want to remind everyone, we

43
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:22,317
are happily carrying along the torch of 826LA, a
fantastic charity that's been with us from the

44
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:29,433
very beginning. 826 is a wonderful charity that
promotes creative writing skills and literacy in

45
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:34,116
mostly underprivileged kids at a young age, at
which they normally don't have access to tutoring

46
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:39,286
and people to help them on that direction, so if
you can and have the opportunity and you're

47
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:44,499
feeling like giving to some awesome people out
there, 826LA, and 826 in general in your area, is

48
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:48,629
a great charity to take a look at, so please. You
guys have been a tremendous help in the past and

49
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,063
you may continue to be so, if you wish.

50
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,520
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,906
MATT: Good times. Let's see. Taliesin is joining
us from Hawaii. Where are you at, Taliesin?

52
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:05,736
TALIESIN: Where am I right now? I'm in my hotel
room. Somewhere-- which island are we on? Oahu.

53
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,669
We're on Oahu. For Amazing Comic-Con.

54
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:16,207
MATT: If you're on Oahu and you're watching this,
you should go say hi to him. Not right now, but

55
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:19,618
tomorrow and Sunday. And the rest of the great
folks that are out there with you. All good

56
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:27,197
people. Big old Street Fighter troupe. Also, we
have Travis and his nose goblin and Laura, you

57
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:29,561
guys are attending Puerto Rico Comic-Con?

58
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,099
LAURA: Yeah! We leave early tomorrow morning.

59
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,217
LIAM: Ah, you can sleep on the plane.

60
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,314
LAURA: Good times.

61
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:39,749
TRAVIS: Yeah! If you're in Puerto Rico, come see
us. We'll be there, totally sleep-deprived and

62
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:40,929
bushy-tailed.

63
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,349
LIAM: It's a good one, though.

64
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,499
TRAVIS: It's a good one?

65
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,560
LIAM: Yeah, I went to that one.

66
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,562
TRAVIS: We're excited to go. San Juan, baby. San
Juan!

67
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,394
MATT: That's pretty slick, actually.

68
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:50,595
MARISHA: That's awesome.

69
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:54,928
MATT: Does anybody else-- you said you wanted to
mention something?

70
00:03:54,928 --> 00:04:02,499
LIAM: Yeah, Sam Riegel and I are both in Fallout:
Far Harbor, which is the first big DLC story dump.

71
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:09,326
"Fah Hahbah." Fallout is my favorite way to escape
reality second to this, so I hope you come join

72
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:12,543
me. I play a human guy, but there's also a synth.
Look for the synth.

73
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:18,393
SAM: I think I play a synth. And there you go.

74
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:19,689
LIAM: There you go. That's it.

75
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:20,516
SAM: Good plug.

76
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:24,823
MARISHA: You can also build a Taliesin robot,
which I did, and named it the Taliesin 2000.

77
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:26,669
LAURA: Aw, that's awesome!

78
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,006
MATT: So you could take either a custom-build
Taliesin or me as your companion to Far Harbor and

79
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:39,445
talk to these shmucks. And have a full Critical
Role after-the-apocalypse experience. That's

80
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,960
awesome. Okay, we're actually going to be
downloading that soon. Anyone else have anything

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,031
they want to mention before we jump into the game
tonight?

82
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,296
TRAVIS: Let's do this.

83
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,592
MARISHA: I don't want to die.

84
00:04:49,592 --> 00:05:00,357
MATT: Let's go ahead and get this started, as we
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role!

85
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,831
SAM: Nothing's happening.

86
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:03,775
MATT: No intro.

87
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:06,141
SAM: Nothing's happening.

88
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,664
(laughter)

89
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:09,982
SAM: Wait! Let's act it out.

90
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,647
MATT: Act out the intro?

91
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,516
MARISHA: Okay!

92
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:14,456
(imitating music)

93
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,572
TRAVIS: (growls)

94
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:20,314
MARISHA: (swishing sound effects)

95
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,001
SAM: Taliesin, do something!

96
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,524
LIAM: Shoot from your screen!

97
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,743
LAURA: Shoot, you're shooting your gun! Be Percy!

98
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,293
LIAM: Then you got hit by a wang!

99
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,525
LAURA: Oh, you fall over!

100
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:31,363
MATT: Well done Taliesin, that was great. Ashley
picks him up.

101
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,652
LAURA: She's healing him.

102
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,841
ASHLEY: I'll hold your hand! Eyes closed, holding
my holy symbol!

103
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:42,216
MATT: And it got weird.

104
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,041
ASHLEY: Had to add it.

105
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,434
MATT: And now it swings--

106
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:49,591
LIAM: Oh, Laura Bailey standing in for an orc!
(stabbing sound) Ugh, gah! Now be yourself oh!

107
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:50,785
LAURA: Pew pew!

108
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:51,846
LIAM: And I'll go oh!

109
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:53,576
LAURA: And then I'll go oh! Then I wink at you.

110
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,492
TRAVIS: This was not the plan, for the love of god
help us!

111
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:57,897
LAURA: And then I shoot another one at you!

112
00:05:57,897 --> 00:07:26,520
[actual intro plays]

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,182
MATT: Welcome back to this majestic clusterfuck
that is tonight.

114
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,205
(laughter)

115
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:42,208
MATT: As open beta leaves its red and raw path, we
rebuild! We stand up against the swaggering might

116
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:51,307
of the new programming, and we stand tall for
tonight's episode of Critical Role. Previously,

117
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:59,271
Vox Machina, the band of adventurers walking
through Tal'Dorei post-attack of the Chroma

118
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:04,833
Conclave, an evil troupe of chromatic dragons that
are currently holding power in this region and

119
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:12,000
beyond, after tearing through many of the bastions
of society in this countryside. They have gone on

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,342
a quest to search for artifacts known as the
Vestiges of Divergence, from ancient wars and

121
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:21,825
heroes of old and yore, to use against the leader
of the Chroma Conclave, Thordak the Cinder King.

122
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:26,924
Now as part of this confrontation, they made their
way to the city of Westruun, which was partially

123
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:31,388
destroyed by the black dragon, Umbrasyl. While it
was off and away with the rest of the Conclave,

124
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:37,169
was then conquered by the wandering Herd of Storms
that Grog once belonged to. After finding it

125
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,793
occupied by these rather brutal barbaric
individuals, Vox Machina set into the city,

126
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:49,774
destroyed and tore down their leader Kevdak, to
much fanfare from Grog's past. And through

127
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:56,818
Kevdak's son and Grog's majestic might they
decided to take the remainder of the Herd of

128
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:04,129
Storms and take out Umbrasyl, the great black
dragon. Half the Herd didn't like that and has

129
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:10,587
decided to leave to their own devices, where the
rest of the party possibly prepares to plot and

130
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:14,678
plan a way to kill an ancient black dragon.

131
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:18,426
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he said that. Why'd
you have to say it like that? It's just a black

132
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,354
dragon!

133
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:20,410
MATT: What else am I going to say?

134
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,619
LIAM: Why the dramatic pauses?

135
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:22,987
MATT: Because it's fun.

136
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,775
TRAVIS: You used the word 'somehow'.

137
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:33,579
MATT: I like it. You guys, having just finished
this stroke of a conversation with Zanror in the

138
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:39,151
Margrave's homestead, the dawn light is now
beginning to pour over the mountain range in the

139
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:46,998
distance. The day has officially begun. Zanror has
stepped out and has begun to speak with a few of

140
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:52,930
his trusted Herd members to stand down for the
day, letting people know that the battle has been

141
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,671
postponed for the time being while a plan is to be
enacted, prepared for, and then sprung the

142
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:06,728
following day. The rest of you guys have this day
to prepare however you see fit. So I ask you: what

143
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,633
would you like to do?

144
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:13,290
SAM: We have so many things that we need to do!

145
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,832
MATT: Where do we begin?

146
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:26,423
SAM: We need supplies. We need to parlay with our
allies. We need lots of chains.

147
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:32,485
LAURA: We need to trap the dragon obviously on the
ground.

148
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:38,167
SAM: For that we'll need some bindings of some
sort: chains, hooks, spikes.

149
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:43,712
TALIESIN: I have a thought, I have a thought in
that direction. When we're ready, I was thinking

150
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:47,550
of basically building what is essentially a giant
pressurized mousetrap.

151
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,538
LAURA: Is there, how would you do that?

152
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:52,529
LIAM: How much time do you need, Perce?

153
00:10:52,529 --> 00:11:00,696
TALIESIN: Do I have access to some people to help
build it, and some perhaps broken homes and chunks

154
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,938
of wood and chain?

155
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:10,127
MATT: You do have access to broken homes, chain,
and scraps at your disposal. As far as individuals

156
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:16,241
that can aid you, you have individuals that can
help hold things for you. The Herd of Storms is

157
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:21,727
not known for its ingenious use of tinkering
tools, but--

158
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,128
LAURA: What about blacksmiths in town? Are there
any blacksmiths left?

159
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,580
MATT: You can check around.

160
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,883
TALIESIN: This would be a blacksmith just to make
a couple springs. This is not a complicated-- This

161
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:37,002
is literally something you could make in the
woods. It's a slightly more complex version of

162
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:41,387
something you could make in the woods to catch
birds. I'm just building a really big version.

163
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:51,258
It's a whole bunch of systems like this that will
have chains and weights on them that when you

164
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:55,087
disrupt the weight at the center the whole thing
goes clunk, throws a whole bunch of-- it's

165
00:11:55,087 --> 00:12:03,787
basically a netting system. It's an entanglement
and will be an entanglement.

166
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:13,186
MATT: Okay. I'll tell you what. Go ahead and roll
an investigation check, Percy, if you don't mind.

167
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,033
LAURA: Can we help him at all?

168
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:21,427
MATT: Yeah, I'll say if you want to go ahead and
aid to that, take advantage on that, Percy.

169
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:27,628
TALIESIN: Thank god. Yeah, no, not very good.

170
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,217
MATT: What'd you roll?

171
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,530
TALIESIN: I rolled a six.

172
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,737
LAURA and MATT: With advantage?

173
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,166
TALIESIN: Yes.

174
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:48,929
MATT: So! After taking the better part of about
three hours scouring the town, most of the

175
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,136
remaining villagers--

176
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,270
LAURA: He took three hours doing that?!

177
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,721
MATT: Three hours, so, from what he's doing with
the aid of people that aided him, which would be

178
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:04,621
Vex asking about, the few folks that have any
experience with any sort of blacksmithy are the

179
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:10,298
folks that make horseshoes, and that's the extent
of the complication they can create. So they can

180
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:15,414
attempt to, with your aid, craft some springs.
They have the materials to do very basic metalwork

181
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:22,453
and ironwork, but the people you encounter, two
folks in particular, they're both a little

182
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:28,853
confused by your overall design and are waiting
for you to lead them in a specific direction.

183
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:32,634
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just going to take them and
I'm going to start building one and see if they

184
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:38,136
can follow suit then. Three springs will be more
than enough for this design.

185
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,591
MATT: How big a spring?

186
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:44,125
TALIESIN: I would say, how tall is this dragon?

187
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,799
MATT: Roughly 30 to 40 feet, depending.

188
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:57,509
TALIESIN: About a two-to-three-foot spring, then.
Three two-to-three-foot springs made of solid

189
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:07,201
iron. Just enough to lift the system and toss. And
it's just, you make them like chainmail. It's a

190
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:11,833
process that exists. I'm not going nuts.

191
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:19,467
MATT: I'm not saying you're going nuts. You are a
little stretched for supplies and manpower based

192
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:25,228
on the circumstances in Westruun for a complicated
task, but it's fairly possible, but it will pretty

193
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:30,132
much take the entirety of your day and most of
your night to prepare this. You'll be able to

194
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:39,692
squeeze by with this, with the construction of the
device, and have maybe just enough room for-- I'll

195
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:46,502
let you squeeze in a long rest.

196
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,311
TALIESIN: That'll be perfect.

197
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,506
MATT: But that's success or fail.

198
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,203
TALIESIN: That'll do.

199
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,441
MATT: Okay. What are the rest of you guys
planning?

200
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:58,928
LIAM: Three hours ago, back when we were still
together, I pulled Scanlan aside. Listen, I want

201
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:00,744
to talk to you. I have an idea.

202
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:07,066
SAM: Is this about Kaylie? Because I'm still
worried about her. But I don't think that we

203
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:13,729
should discuss her right now. We have other
things! Why are you harping on this? She's my

204
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:14,764
daughter.

205
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:17,584
(laughter)

206
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,536
SAM: Just give it a rest.

207
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:24,845
LIAM: You're right, I should have never dragged
you down into the sewers, and I apologize. It

208
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:31,334
won't happen again. But listen to me. I have an
idea. It's a dangerous idea, and I don't want to

209
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:35,233
lead with it. I don't want to fight this dragon,
to be honest, but I think the group is going that

210
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:42,113
direction. If we do-- Percival's run off to try
something, maybe we're just going to run out. I

211
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,851
have an idea that only you can do.

212
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:48,042
SAM: Okay.

213
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:52,044
LIAM: We have a rod.

214
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,939
SAM: Yes.

215
00:15:53,939 --> 00:16:00,865
LIAM: Not the cube. A rod that 
cannot be moved.

216
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:04,328
SAM: We could use it in some way.

217
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:18,960
LIAM: You can teleport, and I'm almost too afraid
to even suggest it, but if shit goes south, how

218
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:26,595
would you feel about teleporting inside of
Umbrasyl's stomach? With that rod.

219
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:30,495
SAM: Well, what has he eaten? Because it could be
nasty in there!

220
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:36,723
LIAM: I assume it will. I don't know anatomy. I
haven't talked to my sister about this. She might

221
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:41,487
be able to give us input, and I don't want to lead
with this. I don't want you to do it because I

222
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,563
feel like you could melt in there.

223
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:49,074
SAM: Of course I could melt in there! I'm a little
man and he's got acid on him!

224
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:57,384
LIAM: I know. I'm looking for a way through this
fucking clusterfuck and if there's nothing else to

225
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:06,655
do, you could go in there and click that rod and
give him the worst suppository ever invented!

226
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:16,050
SAM: Listen. If there's a man invented who can
go to where shit is made and make some really good

227
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:22,748
shit, that's me. So let's pursue this. As a plan
B.

228
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:30,067
LIAM: As a plan B. And I take him by the
shoulders. You remember that little talk we had

229
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,562
about a week ago, when you told--

230
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,203
SAM: Is this about Kaylie again?

231
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,983
LIAM: No, we can talk about Kaylie in a couple of
days, all right?

232
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:37,920
SAM: Okay.

233
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,802
LIAM: When you told me how things were better now?
Okay, you remember that?

234
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:42,729
SAM: Yes.

235
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:47,913
LIAM: That was fucking insane. They are not
better. Everything is terrible! Our lives are

236
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:53,839
terrible. They are way worse than they were six
months ago, way worse. I was with all of you

237
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,867
assholes a year ago, and two years ago, they're
way worse.

238
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:05,551
SAM: You're saying that, a sullen loner who is
confiding in one of his closest friends while

239
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:10,055
holding him on the shoulders. This you never had
before.

240
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:17,295
LIAM: I slap him on the cheek a little bit and
say: you are a fucking madman, but I am glad

241
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,399
you're here.

242
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,875
SAM: I'm glad to be with you.

243
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,102
LIAM: And I love you. And I give him a playful
slap across the face.

244
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,816
SAM: Six points of damage.

245
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,962
(laughter)

246
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:31,155
MATT: Unexpected, sneak attack. 7d6 points of
damage.

247
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:38,676
SAM: All right, so I'm going to go talk to Vex. An
expert in dragons I hope?

248
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:43,051
LAURA: I'm an expert on dragons.

249
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:45,893
SAM: And ask her how dragons work, how their
bodies work.

250
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,193
LAURA: What do you mean?

251
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:54,037
SAM: Where they're vulnerable, where they make the
acid, where they have lungs, where they have

252
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:59,265
stomachs, how many stomachs? Are they like a cow
with eight stomachs or something?

253
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,760
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check with
advantage.

254
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,104
TRAVIS: Cows have eight stomachs?

255
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,775
MARISHA: They've got like two or three.

256
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:14,383
LAURA: Shut up! 17.

257
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:20,813
MATT: 17. Yeah, dragons have the pieces you
imagine they would have in the right vicinity.

258
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:27,146
Their stomach is quite acidic, as it has been
known to dissolve some of the hardiest of

259
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:31,656
creatures, let alone break down some basic
minerals and materials. So it's not a happy place

260
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:39,075
to be, but it's not like instantaneous
dissolution. It will hurt. Also know that the

261
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:46,357
breath weapon, the acid that a black dragon, which
uses acid as a breath weapon in a stream in front

262
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:50,093
of it, much like your lightning bolt, does not
come from its stomach. That acid is much more

263
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:55,537
toxic, concentrated, and comes from a separate
part of its body, a gland, a breathing mechanism

264
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,340
that projects it outward.

265
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,632
LAURA: Where's the gland located? Would I know
that, like, in his throat?

266
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,302
MATT: It's somewhere in this vicinity, you're not
entirely certain.

267
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,862
SAM: So if I miss, end up in that gland, that
would be not good.

268
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,201
MATT: That would be really bad.

269
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,745
LIAM: Don't roll a one!

270
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:15,538
ASHLEY: But that would probably be really hard to
just get right into that spot.

271
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,591
LIAM: But you know, you wouldn't suffer.

272
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,063
LAURA: It would be instantaneous, at least.

273
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:29,095
SAM: Also. Vex. Vex'ahlia.

274
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,917
LAURA: Oh. Getting fancy now, Scanlan Shorthalt.

275
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:42,188
SAM: Thank you. Your brother tells me that you
have some sort of acid-resistant something.

276
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:45,177
LAURA: The armor? That I took from him?

277
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,934
LIAM: Yes, my armor. She has it.

278
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,906
LAURA: Well-- are you here? Are you next-- are you
next to me now?

279
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:55,657
LIAM: No, I'm about five feet behind you rolling
my eyes and doing this the whole time you're

280
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:57,302
talking about dragons.

281
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:02,702
LAURA: It's the armor that I won fair and square
from him! Yes, I am wearing it right now.

282
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,574
SAM: Is that your primary armor?

283
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:06,147
LAURA: It is.

284
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:11,903
SAM: How would you feel about me asking you to
take it off? Doing a little unbuckling and giving

285
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,430
it to me instead?

286
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,214
LAURA: Scanlan, that's going to cost you a lot of
money.

287
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:19,064
SAM: We could swap armor.

288
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,264
LAURA: You think your little armor will fit me.

289
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:26,049
SAM: I have a pretty broad chest. These are pecs.

290
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,712
LAURA: What kind of armor do you have?

291
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,826
SAM: I have cold snap leather armor.

292
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,580
LAURA: Which is cold resistant?

293
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,936
SAM: Cold resistant. Maybe the dragon will throw
snowballs at you.

294
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,215
LAURA: I doubt that. What is it, is it plus two?

295
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,765
LIAM: Yeah.

296
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,623
SAM: Plus two on top of the armor, so it's four.

297
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:44,119
MATT: So it's armor plus two.

298
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,820
LIAM: It's better overall.

299
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,899
LAURA: Okay. Well sweet, then yeah, sure, give it
to me.

300
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,318
SAM: Can we do that?

301
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:50,160
MATT: Yeah.

302
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,817
LAURA: Strip on down there, Scanlan.

303
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:52,929
SAM: Well, ladies first!

304
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,957
LAURA: No, you first, I want to see the cube and
then I'll give you my armor.

305
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:58,210
SAM: Shall we make it interesting and play a
little poker?

306
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,125
LAURA: There's no time for that.

307
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:09,477
SAM: All right. I very slowly and sultrily
unbuckle my armor, let one strap fall, let the

308
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:16,422
other strap fall, just do a little shimmy and let
it fall to the ground, sort of like The Crying

309
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:24,517
Game. Just sort of, camera pans up a little bit
and it's just, there's nothing underneath, it's

310
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:28,704
just me and the cube. And I cry a little.

311
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:30,673
(laughter)

312
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:37,321
LIAM: During which I pick up Scanlan's shawm and
start playing it terribly. No idea what I'm doing.

313
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,983
Do you blow into this, are there strings? I don't
know.

314
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,368
LAURA: I try really hard not to start laughing.

315
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:50,152
SAM: Go with what your body tells you to do. 
How are you going to take off your armor?

316
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:54,001
LAURA: That's a good question. Do you want to walk
away for this?

317
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,203
LIAM: Yeah, I leave the room.

318
00:22:56,203 --> 00:23:03,475
LAURA: I completely ungracefully take it off and
throw it at you. Give me that armor. How is this

319
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:07,718
going to fit me? I'm just naked trying to squirm
into these extra-skinny jeans.

320
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:13,623
MATT: Actually, as you pull the armor pieces up,
they shift and formfit to your size as part of

321
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:15,041
their enchantment.

322
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,020
LAURA: What color is it? Is it beautiful?

323
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,270
MATT: The cold snap armor is I believe dark browns
with traces of white and silver along the edges as

324
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,956
a cold winter motif as part of the enchantment.

325
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:31,549
LAURA: Does it match my storm bow?

326
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:33,743
MATT: Yeah, I guess you could say that.

327
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,667
LAURA: You might not be getting this back,
Scanlan.

328
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,887
SAM: Oh, really? Well. What does mine look like?

329
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:42,569
MATT: For a moment, it looks pretty haphazard and
hanging off of you.

330
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,788
SAM: Oh, these are like C-cups up here.

331
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:47,644
(laughter)

332
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:50,356
MATT: As the armor slowly retracts and finds
itself to your form.

333
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,686
SAM: Oh! They went down.

334
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:58,541
MATT: In that moment, Scanlan learned a lot about
himself.

335
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:06,170
SAM: All right. I feel good about this. Now we'll
continue our dragon lesson I suppose.

336
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,326
LAURA: Wait, why did you need to change-- are you
going to be up close and personal with him?

337
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:13,733
SAM: Well, I think we all are, you know. 
He breathes acid.

338
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,462
LAURA: Well yes, but.

339
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:18,442
SAM: Yeah, so we could get hit! Now I'm more
protected than you are!

340
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:21,910
LAURA: This was a really stupid-- why did I give
that up?

341
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,923
SAM: I'm very charming.

342
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,196
LAURA: Now you're not here?

343
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:27,856
LIAM: You told me to leave! You took off your
clothes. I'm Liam, I'm not Vax, what're you

344
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:28,980
talking about?

345
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,907
LAURA: Are you planning on doing something?

346
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:38,669
SAM: We're all planning on doing something, and I
don't think that my part of the plan is any

347
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:45,775
stupider than yours will be. So. Good luck to you.
I'll keep your armor safe. Hopefully we can trade

348
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,511
back. And if not, you can peel it off my dead
body.

349
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:53,260
LAURA: As long as you're not melted from all the
acid.

350
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:00,019
ASHLEY: I'd like to attune to my frostbrand
sword.

351
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:05,652
MATT: Okay, so you'll be putting aside the mace of
disruption and taking on the frostband instead.

352
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,262
Okay. Cool.

353
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:11,547
LIAM: Oh, shit, I go running after Percival. I'm
going to go find Percival.

354
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:12,955
TALIESIN: Yeah.

355
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:16,169
LIAM: Yeah. Well. Does that take an hour, or do I
catch up with him pretty quick?

356
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:22,278
MATT: You would know the direction he went, and
thankfully in the awkward still-quiet that is the

357
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:28,956
center of the town now that it's missing most of its
populace, and those that are there are

358
00:25:28,956 --> 00:25:32,889
acknowledging the tension of what might be coming,
and many of them are now packing up and leaving

359
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:36,262
and getting out of the town, evacuating when
they've been notified of the possible coming

360
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:43,717
battle. The sound of metal clangs in the distance,
and the gathering of materials from some of the

361
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:49,261
rubble is not too difficult to discern over time.
Takes you about half an hour or so to locate him.

362
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:52,368
LIAM: Oh, there's that white hair. Percival!

363
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:56,612
TALIESIN: Yes? Hello. Bit busy. What?

364
00:25:56,612 --> 00:26:01,366
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't want to take up a
lot of your time. I reckon you're going to be busy

365
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,020
with this all day, yeah?

366
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,888
TALIESIN: Oh yes. This is quite a project.

367
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:13,303
LIAM: Ah, and also tomorrow. You're probably going to
be taking potshots at that thing, yeah?

368
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:17,561
TALIESIN: Ah, that's my hope is to be, honestly,
as far away from this as humanly possible.

369
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:26,120
LIAM: That's probably not my plan. Can I have use
of your blade?

370
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:34,973
TALIESIN: Oh! The dragonslayer longsword, yes, of
course, of course. I pull it off my belt and hand

371
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:45,067
it off. Could help. I'm a little terrified that
you're getting that close to it, but here it is.

372
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,697
LIAM: It's just in case.

373
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,538
TALIESIN: It's quite a piece.

374
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:54,861
LIAM: Good luck today.

375
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:56,320
TALIESIN: Thank you.

376
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,365
LIAM: Good luck tomorrow.

377
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:02,864
TALIESIN: I am down to my normal sword now.

378
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:06,580
LAURA: Can I be talking to Zanror?

379
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,644
MARISHA: I'll join you in that. That was my next
plan.

380
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:19,407
MATT: The two of you eventually find Zanror.
Zanror and Warra are in the process of piling

381
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:25,142
weapons and armor with the rest of the Herd into
the center of the town where the battle outside of

382
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:30,510
the Margrave's house happened. Most of the
warriors there are in the process of steeling

383
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,978
themselves, some of them are gathering their
materials, some are in the process of doing some

384
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:43,765
minor ritualistic scarring in preparation for the
battle. There is very little conversation

385
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:49,214
happening. It seems like there is this quiet
understanding that this, for many, might be their

386
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:56,501
last day. They're making peace with the coming
glory of battle. You'd expect this sense of tense

387
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:04,528
fear, this very Battle of Helm's Deep-type
acceptance of doom, but this is a different

388
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:10,769
personality amongst the Herd here. There is almost
a brimming excitement with the idea of possible

389
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:18,464
glory or at least a glorious end. And it very much
befits the story that you've heard of Grog's past

390
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:22,321
history, and very easy to see where he once came
from.

391
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:29,798
LAURA: I bring Zanror a big tankard of ale and sit
down in front of him.

392
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:32,116
MATT "Oh, good to see you."

393
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,683
MARISHA: I stand behind Vex'ahlia.

394
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:37,464
MATT: "This for me?"

395
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,858
LAURA: Yeah.

396
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:40,890
MATT: Looks to Worra.

397
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,124
MARISHA: Don't worry, we wouldn't try to poison
you the night before a dragon-fight.

398
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:48,576
MATT: (laughs) "That would be rather stupid,
wouldn't it?"

399
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:49,870
MARISHA: It would.

400
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,720
MATT: And he just downs it all in one big chug.
"Thanks."

401
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,665
LAURA: Zanror? Did I hear you correctly before,
that you have been the one speaking with the beast

402
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,264
in the past?

403
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,750
MATT: "I have, aye."

404
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:11,498
LAURA: So when it comes and gathers its treasure,
it stops and talks, or does it just come and take

405
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,015
it and leave?

406
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:20,776
MATT: "It has at times. More at the beginning. If
it had questions and seemed curious. That wore off

407
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:25,310
"after the first few times. Now it just seems to
come and take and find its way out."

408
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,510
LAURA: So if the treasure looked different this
time, it might stop and talk about it?

409
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,496
MATT: He stops for a second. "Maybe."

410
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:45,910
LAURA: I'm curious because I know you said you are
lacking in gold and treasure. What will entice the beast?

411
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:55,779
MATT: "Hm. Beyond that, I don't really know.
That's what is forcing our hand right now."

412
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:02,493
LAURA: What if we had a way of providing some
gold?

413
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:15,502
And maybe you provide an offering of a different
kind? What if you say that your father Kevdak had

414
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:22,207
been plotting against the dragon and you found out
about it. Would you be able to offer his body and

415
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:27,838
the body of his allies as tribute to the dragon?

416
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:30,301
MATT: "Huh."

417
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:33,092
LAURA: Dragons are <i>vain</i>.

418
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:45,577
MATT: And you do know specifically white dragons,
or sorry, black dragons, they're very cruel by

419
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:53,875
nature. They actually enjoy messing with creatures
they see below them, especially intended prey,

420
00:30:53,875 --> 00:31:02,839
torturing for extended periods of time before
killing. They aren't comparatively as vain as

421
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,697
other dragons per se, but all chromatics fall in
some way shape or form on that same scale of

422
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:23,035
self-love to the point of being a near-disease to
many of them. Zanror thinks to himself for a

423
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:31,017
second and goes, "We can certainly try. I mean,
I've got no more use for it, though it's going to

424
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:35,929
"be hard to convince it without a head. I'm pretty
sure Grog took that with him."

425
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:47,596
LAURA: Well, we may be able to get that back. How
are you planning on hiding your fellow warriors

426
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:53,411
from the dragon so as not to attract its
attention? Because we may have some ideas.

427
00:31:53,411 --> 00:32:03,072
MATT: "We'll have to share ideas. Ours was to go
ahead and plod up Gatshadow. Usually it's about

428
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:12,365
"noon when it comes down for the offering. We leave
it what little we have left, possibly lose two

429
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:19,135
"men in the process of delivering it, and then when
it returned to its place we'd be there waiting to

430
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:24,733
"ambush it once it returned, use that time when it
was gone to go ahead and hole up inside its home."

431
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:25,877
LAURA: Okay.

432
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,341
MATT: "That was our intent."

433
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,123
MARISHA: We might be able to do one better.

434
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:32,078
LAURA: A dragon's lair is not--

435
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,817
MARISHA: Especially a black dragon's lair.

436
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:42,973
LAURA: We wouldn't do much damage to it there, in
fact, it's probably laid several traps against us

437
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,606
already.

438
00:32:44,606 --> 00:32:47,733
MATT: "Well, there's not much we can really do
when we're all fighting with our fucking axes and

439
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:51,175
"swords, can we? In the lair at least it's stuck on
the ground."

440
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:53,947
LAURA: What if we could trap it onto the ground
here?

441
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:56,407
MATT: "How do you intend to do that?"

442
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:05,570
LAURA: We have a wonderful tinkerer. Quite
talented. And he's creating something to trap the

443
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,175
dragon.

444
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:08,427
MATT: "Really."

445
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:16,904
LAURA: Plus we can provide several chains. Once
it's on the ground, maybe your very strong

446
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:24,757
goliaths could try to snare it, grappling-hook it,
throw some chains up and over?

447
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:31,186
MARISHA: This pile of weapons you have here, I see
a decent amount of javelins. A rudimentary

448
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:37,748
harpoon, in the hands of some of your strongest,
could help wrangle him down.

449
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:48,395
MATT: He stops for a second and goes, "I just want
to be clear we don't underestimate the sheer size,

450
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:56,817
"strength, and ferocity of this beast. With all 20
men, we might be able to hold it down, I don't

451
00:33:56,817 --> 00:34:03,009
"know how long. I hope that contraption your friend
is making is strong enough to aid us that last

452
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:08,177
"little bit, because I get the feeling that if our
might is put to just keeping it on the ground--

453
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:16,538
"well, that's a lot less of our strengths that we
could be tending to. A lot less blades we could

454
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,217
"put into its hide."

455
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:23,161
LAURA: Well, hopefully it would only be needed for
a small amount of time before our magic users have

456
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,903
their way with it.

457
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:28,019
MARISHA: About that time I light up my hands.

458
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:36,152
MATT: "That's impressive. You know what else is
impressive? Watching four of my friends melt in a

459
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,122
"matter of seconds."

460
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:42,009
MARISHA: That is very impressive. You're not
wrong.

461
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:48,750
MATT: "I just want to instill with you an
understanding not to be brash, not to go ahead and

462
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:59,149
"run into this unless you're absolutely certain.
Now. I've got chains, you've got chains. We've got

463
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:08,172
"strong men. If we put ourselves intent on just
holding this beast down, I have the feeling, even

464
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:13,909
"with our weight behind it, it's going to be a
difficult attempt. Do we have any other way of

465
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:16,890
"anchoring it down, something else we can put the
chains to?"

466
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,981
MARISHA: About that time I walk over to the-- is
there a stone wall in here?

467
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:24,766
MATT: I mean, there are pieces of stone building
in the vicinity.

468
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:33,001
MARISHA: I put my hand against the stone and I
cast Transmute Rock and I push my hand into the

469
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,995
stone as it turns to mud.

470
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:39,527
LAURA: And now turn it back, Keyleth.

471
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:48,443
MARISHA: I take a spear that's on the floor, stick
it in, and then turn it back.

472
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:52,199
MATT: All right. Let me look this up real fast.

473
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,979
MARISHA: See? Magic.

474
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:55,797
(laughter)

475
00:35:55,797 --> 00:36:02,185
MARISHA: Put my hand underneath the spear. Put my
hand over the spear.

476
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:04,377
LAURA: Ah? Ah? No strings!

477
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:08,307
MARISHA: Where is it, where is it?

478
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:15,575
MATT: Yeah, mud to rock, yeah. Lasts for-- it's
instantaneous. So when he looks at that, he goes,

479
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:22,295
"So. What you're saying is if we can find a few
places in which the rock is close to the surface,

480
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:24,920
"you could lock these chains in?"

481
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,679
MARISHA: I think I could lock the whole dragon
in.

482
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:35,823
LAURA: Once it's on the ground, if we can pull it
down enough, she may be able to lock its legs into

483
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:37,405
the stone.

484
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:45,832
MARISHA: Beyond that, if that fails-- And then I
cast, for right now I'll just do Wall of Stone,

485
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:52,433
I'm just burning through all my spells as a
demonstration. And I bring up two pillows. Two

486
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:53,622
pillows?

487
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:55,525
ASHLEY: And then we all lay down and go to sleep!

488
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:56,903
SAM: Pillow fight!

489
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:59,205
(laughter)

490
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:02,381
LIAM: Billy Mays here for the Ashari Tribe!

491
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:08,097
MATT: "Goose down. Unexpected tactic."

492
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:12,899
LAURA: I like how we're walking through all of
these ideas and none of it's going to work when we

493
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,502
get there.

494
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:19,401
MARISHA: I blast up two pillars, right next to
Kevdak.

495
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:22,765
MATT: Not next to Kevdak. You mean Zanror?

496
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:26,371
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry. Sorry, the other big
goliath leader.

497
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,018
SAM: Whatever your name is.

498
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,532
MATT: That one, ohmygod.

499
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,471
MARISHA: And trap him in.

500
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:36,415
MATT: Okay, you (rumbles). Warra's pushed to the
side as the stone shoots up.

501
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:41,034
MARISHA: (whispers) Sorry, Warra, sorry. So-- I
know! Did not mean to lay a hand.

502
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:52,076
MATT: "All right, your point is made. We've got
two others who can do similar magic as you, maybe

503
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:53,577
"not the same level, but--"

504
00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:54,761
MARISHA: Fantastic.

505
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:56,081
MATT: "Want us to put them at your aid?"

506
00:37:56,081 --> 00:38:04,039
MARISHA: That would be wonderful. Beyond that, in
prep, I can dig a trench, hidden underground

507
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,438
around our trap, so that whenever we're ready,
your army can bust out of the ground.

508
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:10,780
LAURA: Surprise.

509
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,369
MARISHA: Without being seen.

510
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:14,519
MATT: "Without being seen, what, are we going to
bury my men?"

511
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,224
LAURA: Very lightly.

512
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:24,004
MARISHA: Pretty much. To be fair, I actually did
it on a trap to kill like eight of your men on the

513
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:27,178
way in and it worked phenomenally. So you should
trust me.

514
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:28,796
LAURA: It was pretty great.

515
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,070
MARISHA: It worked well.

516
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,480
MATT: "I think we'll take our chances above
ground, please."

517
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:41,639
LAURA: The only thing I'm worried about, Zanror,
is that if this ugly beast flies in and sees, oh,

518
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,372
how many of your men do you have?

519
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,698
MATT: "Currently we're sitting at 25 total,
including myself."

520
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:53,798
LAURA: 25 men standing around. Don't you think
it's going to be a little curious as to why all of

521
00:38:53,798 --> 00:39:01,504
the sudden-- all of a sudden? There's a large
number of people around, that's never been there

522
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,656
before?

523
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,981
MATT: "You're asking me this, our plan was to go
inside while it was out. But if you want us there,

524
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,742
"let's figure out a way to hide, then. I don't
think my men are going to like to be

525
00:39:09,742 --> 00:39:11,144
"underground."

526
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:14,992
MARISHA: It'll be very spacious. It'll be a nice
big tunnel, it's not going to feel like you're

527
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,820
buried alive.

528
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,390
MATT: "And what, they just leap out one by
one through an opening?"

529
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,204
LAURA: It'll be super shallow. Just enough that
they can come on up and out.

530
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:29,784
MARISHA: It'll be awesome, it will look like
they're coming out of the grave. They'll look like

531
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,460
badasses!

532
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:41,260
MATT: "I don't think that's going to really get a
dragon shaking in its claws, y'know?" (sighs)

533
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,253
LAURA: Not a lot is going to get a dragon shaking
in its claws.

534
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:51,025
MATT: "Let me talk to my men. We'll see what we
can do, we can muster as far as these chains go."

535
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:56,053
LAURA: A surprise attack is going to be one of our
best shots at grounding this thing.

536
00:39:56,053 --> 00:40:00,546
MATT: "So, am I to tell my men we're 
going to bury them in the ground?"

537
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:06,001
MARISHA: Not bury them, that sounds so dramatic
when you say it like that, I mean I'm going to

538
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:11,531
make a tunnel, there'll be stairs, they'll be able
to walk freely, they'll have air holes, it'll be

539
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,505
just like when you moved through the sewers to not
be seen.

540
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:26,494
MATT: "I'll talk to them. I certainly hope your
magic stone-shaping is as strong as it is. At the

541
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:31,323
"very first moment that dragon looks like it's
going to go ahead and break free, we're weapons

542
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:33,593
"out. You do understand that."

543
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:36,646
MARISHA: We would appreciate that, actually.

544
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:37,891
MATT: "Okay."

545
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:43,084
LAURA: We want it to land, then we strike. We just
want it to hit the fucking ground.

546
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:49,769
MATT: "Okay. And what's our bait? You say you have
some gold to give?"

547
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,940
LAURA: Some gold to give.

548
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:59,403
MATT: "Try for Kevdak's corpse-- I hope that's
enough. I'll see what else we've got left in our

549
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:05,723
"coffers." He turns around and him and Warra walk
away, a couple of the men join them and they--

550
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:11,685
MARISHA: Oh, I actually-- I go over to Warra real
quick before she walks away? Just to her side, and

551
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:19,707
say, you look well. Have the Seers told you if it's
going to be a boy or a girl yet?

552
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:32,356
MATT: "Not yet. But if we survive this, I have a
feeling I'll know. The strength and glory of this

553
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,362
"fight will confirm."

554
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:44,662
MARISHA: If you survive this fight, I'm pretty
sure you'll bear the strongest child anyone has

555
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:46,368
ever known.

556
00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:50,218
LAURA: The stallion that mounts the world, for
sure.

557
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:53,468
LIAM: There it is, there it is. It's in all our
heads.

558
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:55,826
MATT: Nothing ever goes wrong when that title
comes up.

559
00:41:55,826 --> 00:41:59,350
(laughter)

560
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,466
MATT: What could possibly go wrong? She looks over
her shoulder at Zanror as he's walking away and

561
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:11,402
goes, "Could be." And she just turns and starts
walking with him.

562
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:15,071
LAURA: So we really need to dig a trench.

563
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:17,535
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to start digging a
trench.

564
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,884
LAURA: Around the area that the treasure is going
to be.

565
00:42:22,884 --> 00:42:24,685
MARISHA: How far is it?

566
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:30,870
MATT: You guys scope it out, it's northwest of the
town, you saw it on the way in, and it's very easy

567
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:34,118
to make out at this point because there have been
large claw-marks in the ground, there are broken

568
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:38,385
pieces of wood, there's a shattered cart, there's
some barrels that are partially destroyed to the

569
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:44,236
side, there's a little bit of leftover ends and
pieces that fell out of whatever it picked up as

570
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:48,541
it took off as well as a smattering of copper,
silver, and gold pieces that you rummaged through

571
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:53,497
before when you first came to the town. But
there's a definitive place that you recognize

572
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:59,777
where this drop point is, it's out in the open in
the field, there's going to be a couple of nearby

573
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:06,096
rocks, a handful of trees, but they're all very
sparse and spread apart. Other than that, it's

574
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:07,620
just open field, so.

575
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,106
MARISHA: How far away is the nearest tree
cluster?

576
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:16,206
MATT: To that, it's about-- tree cluster? I mean,
most of the trees that are here are singular,

577
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:21,440
there's two trees that are within ten feet of each
other and that's maybe 80 feet away from it.

578
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,492
MARISHA: Okay.

579
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:37,455
LAURA: When you dig the trench, can I use my
perception and my ranger ability to camouflage

580
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:41,490
things and make sure that from above the ground,
from the height that the dragon will be looking at

581
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,058
it, that it's not seeable at all? I don't want
this trap to be seen-- I guess I should wait until

582
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:50,426
we find out if Percy finishes his trap and gets it
in place to do all of this.

583
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:59,114
MATT: You can do that if you'd like to. Yeah, as
far as the camouflage ability--

584
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:04,166
LAURA: I know Hide in Plain Sight is for myself,
but I feel like as a ranger I'd be able to hide

585
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,042
tracks and stuff.

586
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:11,233
MATT: I'll say we can certainly give you--

587
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,776
LAURA: We can use a little Dust of Tracelessness
or something?

588
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,652
MATT: We can make something function a little bit
there, you know, illusion magic is also helpful.

589
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:24,228
If you have anything illusion-based that could
even just help tidy up before. You do know that

590
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:31,611
dragons are very perceptive creatures and are
very-- are not very trusting either. They're

591
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:38,474
paranoid. That is part of their narcissism, so
anything you can use, whether it be illusion,

592
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:44,422
camouflage, anything to hide any sort of possible
chance of it not trusting this scenario you're

593
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:48,340
going to want to do, otherwise this thing might
fly overhead and notice one thing and be like ah,

594
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:56,395
peace! So. Be warned. Miss Dragon Specialist.

595
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:59,129
LIAM: That was all knowledge in your head.

596
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,833
LAURA: I know all of these things! All of a
sudden!

597
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,391
MARISHA: Did he just say dragons have really high
perception so don't fuck with anything and make it

598
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:05,612
look weird?

599
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:09,228
LAURA: No, he said if we're going to do it, make
sure it is hidden.

600
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:11,429
MARISHA: Right. Make it look real good. Right.

601
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:18,454
TRAVIS: Can I go up to some of the guards
outside and say, oi. Where do you keep your

602
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,649
prisoners, hostages, meat shields?

603
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:30,609
MATT: I mean, there are no real guards of Westruun
anymore, most of the guards that--

604
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,598
TRAVIS: I meant like the goliath, the Herd
guards.

605
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:36,170
MATT: Yeah, the Herd guards. They're a little
sparse right now, there aren't any towards the

606
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,653
outside of town, most of them are gathering
towards the center as the rest of the folks are

607
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:44,559
leaving the town, finding their way out south of
Westruun to be away from the battle. But you do

608
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,828
find in the Margrave center, similar area to where
they were talking to Zanror, there are gathering

609
00:45:50,828 --> 00:45:55,737
warriors that are getting their weapons ready,
some of them armoring up to just see how easily

610
00:45:55,737 --> 00:46:01,360
they can get it on, some of them might even sleep
in their armaments, it's not a huge thing. But as

611
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,159
you approach and ask this question, one of them
turns to you and goes, "Well, there's-- the Iron

612
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:14,938
"Stocks is where we generally keep our prisoners.
The ones who were before and the few we did keep,

613
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:20,055
"well, those we chained up or executed, but there
were a few that were thrown in there."

614
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:23,255
TRAVIS: Are there any still in there? Or are they
all clear?

615
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:26,377
MATT: "Oh, there's plenty of prisoners still in
there, we didn't touch the prison, mostly."

616
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:33,068
TRAVIS: Hm. All right, thank you. (whispers) What
was Reginald's daughter's name?

617
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:36,731
LAURA: I don't know if I wrote it down.

618
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,576
SAM: I wrote it down.

619
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:40,676
TRAVIS: I'd like to make my way over to the Iron
Stocks.

620
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:47,041
MATT: Okay. And you've been here before, you know
the Iron Stocks, although you weren't sure if it

621
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:52,222
was being used as still a prison. And seemed
loosely, just throwing a handful of people in for

622
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:54,777
use later on that never quite came to fruition.

623
00:46:54,777 --> 00:47:02,289
MARISHA: I don't know her name either. We might
not have known a name.

624
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,359
TRAVIS: I thought we knew her name. Reginald's
daughter's name?

625
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:05,632
MATT: Do you remember her name?

626
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:07,632
TRAVIS: Are you asking me?

627
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,773
MARISHA: What Sam wrote, he just wrote down
'Reginald's daughter'.

628
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,613
SAM: Maybe he never told us her name.

629
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:19,616
MATT: (laughs) All right, you make your way to the
Iron Stocks. And it is currently unguarded, there

630
00:47:19,616 --> 00:47:25,681
is nobody there, the Herd has lost interest in it,
the door's partially ajar, and as you walk inside

631
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:32,323
you can already smell the place just reeks of
refuse and decay. It looks like everything left in

632
00:47:32,323 --> 00:47:39,952
the middle of a workday. There are still ledgers
open on the front desk, you can see what looks to

633
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:47,554
be a small group of-- a barracks-type scenario to
the left of the entrance that is just completely

634
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:53,057
abandoned and looks like some cases are left open,
scattering various keepsakes and bottles that are

635
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:58,474
shattered on the ground, a lot of people left either
to go into battle to defend against the dragon, to

636
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:01,359
lose their life in it, or just to get the hell out
of Dodge.

637
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,518
TRAVIS: Can I walk up to the ledger and pretend to
read it?

638
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:09,178
MATT: Yeah. You pick it up and leaf through for a
few pages, lotta great squiggles.

639
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,313
TRAVIS: Yep.

640
00:48:10,313 --> 00:48:11,768
MATT: Some pretty handwriting, you can tell--

641
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:13,521
TRAVIS: Any squiggles that look familiar?

642
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:18,879
MATT: Um, no. No, none that-- I mean, some look
familiar, some are more rounded--

643
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:25,093
TRAVIS: Oh, this poor bastard right here, yep, I
remember him, good chap. Hello? Is anyone in here?

644
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:32,731
MATT: There's a slight pause. Then you hear a
voice echo from the right side of the room, down a

645
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:36,343
hall just through the stone, you can barely make
it out because the distance it's at, because

646
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:41,903
you're hearing the echo protrude from quite a
distance, but a voice just says, "Hey! Hey! In

647
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:44,272
"here! Need food please!"

648
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:50,963
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. So I go in that direction. Open
the door and try and make my way that way.

649
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:56,030
MATT: You charge down the hallway and there are a
number of cells that are immediately here. Some of

650
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,938
them are open and abandoned entirely, there are a
few that you look off to the side, looks like a

651
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:07,765
few individuals just passed away inside the cell.
You come to a set of stairs that leads down into

652
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:14,306
the next subterranean region and you hear the
voice again, much closer, be like, "Hey! Hey! I

653
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:18,696
"hear your footsteps!" And you see a hand reaching
out from behind some of the bars.

654
00:49:18,696 --> 00:49:21,148
TRAVIS: Put your hand back inside.

655
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:24,666
MATT: The hand retracts as you look over.

656
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:30,042
TRAVIS: That's a good lad. What's your name?
Before I approach. Still far enough away.

657
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:37,901
MATT: "Ah. Orn. Orn Finch at your service. Been in
here far too long and very thirsty. I will be

658
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:45,951
"happily at your service, fair muscled man, should
you see fit to relinquish me from these binds."

659
00:49:45,951 --> 00:49:53,904
And you look at him, he looks like a lowly beggar,
longish tattered hair, wearing just general

660
00:49:53,904 --> 00:50:00,513
tattered and soiled clothing, no shoes, feet look
blistered and black.

661
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:04,111
TRAVIS: Ugh. I'm going to call you Orn Blackfoot.

662
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:08,301
MATT: "Blackfoot it is, Orn Blackfoot at your
service, if you could just--"

663
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:10,397
TRAVIS: My name is Lord Grog.

664
00:50:10,397 --> 00:50:14,419
MATT: "Lord. It is my pleasure." And he reaches
through and grasps your hand, his fingers are bony

665
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:17,384
and thin, and he takes it and shakes it with what
little strength he has.

666
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:23,281
TRAVIS: Man, you are looking a little rispy-- Pour
out a little ale into a goblet, and I give him a

667
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,752
goblet of ale.

668
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:27,840
MATT: He snatches it from you and slurps into it,
extremely thirsty.

669
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,371
TRAVIS: Ah-ah, not too fast, not too fast, don't
want to get the bubbles. And I reach into the Bag

670
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:39,823
of Holding and I have a dry food ration. I have
three left. Now I have two. And I give him some

671
00:50:39,823 --> 00:50:41,109
dried food ration.

672
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:46,315
MATT: He takes it and eagerly starts jamming it
into his mouth. As he's eating, he's not even

673
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:50,286
talking at you, this is just sheer hunger, the
need to survive has taken over and he's just

674
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:54,125
cramming it in there, choking a couple of times,
keeping himself okay.

675
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,704
TRAVIS: Pace yourself, lad. Tell me, why are you
in here, Orn Blackfoot?

676
00:50:57,704 --> 00:51:07,499
MATT: "Ah, well, this is-- everyone just started
yelling and they abandoned us all here. It's been

677
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:14,927
"terrible hearing the moans and screams going
silent. I thought they abandoned us all."

678
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:20,915
TRAVIS: No, they did, to be clear. They totally
abandoned you. You are really the only person I

679
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:27,965
know of that's in here. All the other mates around
you, they're either sleeping or, you know.

680
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:32,974
MATT: "I appreciate the food and drink, you've
certainly done--" At which point a voice comes

681
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:37,690
from about two cells over behind you that goes--
"Did I hear food and drink?"

682
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,055
TRAVIS: Fuck.

683
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,488
MATT: "Food-- food and drink, please. Please."

684
00:51:41,488 --> 00:51:45,608
TRAVIS: Orn, did you kill all those dried food
rations just now, did you just--

685
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:52,420
MATT: You see him very discreetly pocket some in
his robe. "Oh, everything you gave me is gone, I'm

686
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,521
"sorry, friend."

687
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:57,370
TRAVIS: Man, what an appetite. Do you mind
regurgitating a little like a momma bird into my hand?

688
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,800
MATT: "What?"

689
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,298
TRAVIS: Never mind. Orn, don't, heh, don't move.
And I walk over to see where the other voice is

690
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:06,800
coming from.

691
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,574
MATT: Okay. As you turn around the way, there is
the next set of bars, you see behind there a man

692
00:52:13,574 --> 00:52:21,977
in his forties, also extremely thin and gaunt,
reddish long thin beard, long unkempt brownish red

693
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:26,409
hair that is just crimped up around the base of
it, like it's just gone almost into dreadlock

694
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:33,122
territory from how long he's been in there and
mistreated. You can see dried blood at the corner

695
00:52:33,122 --> 00:52:45,011
of his mouth. He looks up at you. "Sir, if you
would be s-- Grog?" And the moment of recognition

696
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:50,808
hits you, this is Abjurist Noja, whom you
previously--

697
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:55,349
(yelling)

698
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:01,066
TRAVIS: Abjurist is a very powerful-- he has
knowledge of the arcane and stuff, right, he was--

699
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:06,405
LAURA: He was the guy who saved us! He saved us
when the white dragon came to Westruun.

700
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:09,934
LIAM: I was frozen in ice. That guy!

701
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:12,674
TRAVIS: I found us Boba Fett, sweet!

702
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:15,317
MATT: He looks pretty wrecked right now.

703
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,033
LAURA: Oh shit, give him food, Grog!

704
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:21,569
TRAVIS: Abjurist Nosebleed, hold on real quick,
look. And I take the other, the second to last dry

705
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:25,785
food ration, I give him that, and I give him a
thing of ale, I'm like, I'm sorry, it's really dry.

706
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:30,354
MATT: "Thank you, friend, thank you very much."

707
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:35,793
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, you're very welcome! Hold on. Is
there anybody else in this hallway before I give

708
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:38,071
away my last bit of food?

709
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:45,106
MATT: You hear two voices simultaneously down the
end of the hallway come in, one of which is a very

710
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:50,413
weak female voice, the other is a very loud kind
of-- "Hey, bring me food this way, please!" The

711
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:54,289
other one is like, "Please, I ask of you, I'm
starving." And you see these two hands come out of

712
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:56,266
the two cells in the distance.

713
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:00,693
TRAVIS: Right, I'm going to pick a number between
one and ten. Ready? Go.

714
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:08,502
MATT: There's an awkward pause. "Three?" "Seven!
Definitely seven!"

715
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:14,732
TRAVIS: I lean over to Abjurist Noja, I say, I
actually don't know any numbers, so. Y'know what,

716
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:19,313
we're going to deliberate and we'll be with you in
just a moment. (whispers) Abjurist, how old y--,

717
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:21,610
why are you in here, who put you in here?

718
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:30,305
MATT: "I've only been in here for about a week.
Got in an altercation in my store when these

719
00:54:30,305 --> 00:54:35,409
"brutes started walking in. Threw me in here,
didn't even let me take my spellbook."

720
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:41,510
TRAVIS: Oh, that is a crime. I love b-- I can't
even say it. Hold on, stay right there, I'll get

721
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,965
you out-- And I walk back to Orn Blackfoot, I go,
look, hey, so I gave you food, can you do

722
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:47,628
anything, like, special?

723
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:53,126
MATT: "What?"

724
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:57,058
TRAVIS: Like, can you make your hands turn to
flame, can you disappear, are you really good with

725
00:54:57,058 --> 00:54:58,393
a bow and arrow?

726
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:01,975
MATT: "No! No." And he reaches out and grabbing at
your clothes though and starts pulling you--

727
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:03,819
TRAVIS: Hey! Orn, chill!

728
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:09,904
MATT: "But I have friends in many places, though.
I can, I can get you things. I can make

729
00:55:09,904 --> 00:55:11,066
"connections--"

730
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:14,039
TRAVIS: Yeah, but most of the people in here are
dead, right, like they're probably not--

731
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,841
MATT: "Not even here, Emon! I can get you anything
you need from Emon. I can get you from Stillben.

732
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:23,762
"And Lansway, just name it and get me out of here
and I can--"

733
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:26,171
TRAVIS: How long has it been since you've been to
Emon?

734
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:29,410
MATT: "Few months?"

735
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,752
TRAVIS: You got any loved ones there?

736
00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:33,926
MATT: "Why?"

737
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:38,299
TRAVIS: I don't know, just asking, like, do you
want me to take a note from you to them or

738
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:39,627
something, you know.

739
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,170
MATT: "No, if you can release me, I'd be more than
happy to take it myself if you don't mind."

740
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,833
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm still deliberating, sorry.
Enjoy the food that you snuck in your jacket

741
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:55,692
pocket. And I go back towards the front desk area.
And I try and find any-- is there a lever on the

742
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:58,064
wall to release the cells or can I look for keys?

743
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:01,792
MATT: You-- make an investigation check.

744
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,288
TRAVIS: Fuck me.

745
00:56:03,288 --> 00:56:04,487
MATT: Yes.

746
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:07,880
TRAVIS: Your fate is in excellent hands. Oh shit,
you're not dead!

747
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,296
(laughter)

748
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:13,292
TRAVIS: Minus two for a 17!

749
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:22,881
MATT: Ah! All righty. So. After spending the good
part of an hour or so clamoring through, just

750
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:28,319
throwing bookshelves over and (crashing) taking
the desk and actually throwing it onto its back

751
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,377
and pulling drawers out, this is Grog's method of
investigation here, you're just--

752
00:56:32,377 --> 00:56:34,743
TRAVIS: Yeah, just trying some splinters of wood
in the locks just in case.

753
00:56:34,743 --> 00:56:37,581
MATT: Yeah, yeah. You break off a few forks in
some locks.

754
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:39,627
TRAVIS: (laughs) Forks, yeah.

755
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:42,192
MATT: In practice, yeah, whatever looks small
enough and should fit, though it doesn't, but you

756
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:53,043
make it fit. And it doesn't help. You do
eventually find in one of the cells, closed and

757
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:57,509
locked as you look by, there is one person in
guard armor, in Westruun guard armor, that is in

758
00:56:57,509 --> 00:56:59,536
the cell. Not moving.

759
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:02,146
TRAVIS: Hey. Hey, you. I kick him in the back a
bit.

760
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:03,636
MATT: No movement.

761
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:04,899
TRAVIS: I kick him harder.

762
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:06,293
MATT: No movement.

763
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:10,583
TRAVIS: I look down the hallway. I back up a few
steps. And I really run up and kick him really hard.

764
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:16,025
MATT: He just lurches over onto the side. Not
moving.

765
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:18,149
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're dead. Can I pat him down?

766
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:22,438
MATT: Yeah, you reach in and you can smell the
decay starting to set in. And as you get close you

767
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:28,388
can reach through the bars and see him, the actual
area is closed and the door appears to be locked,

768
00:57:28,388 --> 00:57:33,140
and inspecting the body very quickly you can see
that he was stabbed multiple times from behind and

769
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,288
probably left in here to bleed out.

770
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:37,594
TRAVIS: Low perception.

771
00:57:37,594 --> 00:57:43,474
MATT: But you do find on him what appears to be a
ring of keys. Not directly on his body, but

772
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:48,923
underneath the corpse, like he was-- you gather
best you can, someone probably grabbed it, got

773
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,337
their way out, used that moment to stab him and
escape.

774
00:57:51,337 --> 00:58:01,241
TRAVIS: Nice! I take the keys and I jauntily
run by Orn Blackfoot and I go to Abjurist-- Hey,

775
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:05,807
do you know who those other two voices are at the
end of the hallway? Like, did you have anyone with

776
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:07,480
you when you got put in here?

777
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:15,431
MATT: "No, no one with me. Although-- been plenty
of angry discussion from that dwarven fellow down

778
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:16,457
"the way."

779
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:18,242
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got a really rough accent.

780
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:20,389
MATT: "I can hear you!"

781
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:25,275
TRAVIS: Shit. My voice carries. Are you all right
here for one minute? I have to go perform an

782
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:26,527
interview real fast.

783
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:30,977
MATT: "I'm all right." And he just finishes eating
the little bit of the ration that you gave him,

784
00:58:30,977 --> 00:58:32,944
like dried meats and bread.

785
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,894
TRAVIS: All right, sit tight. All right, you two,
put both your hands outside the cell where I can

786
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:38,261
see them.

787
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:44,255
MATT: They both put their hands out. The dwarven
man you can see puts his hand out, the skin is

788
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:50,355
very wrinkled and you can see the varicose veins
on it, the arm hair that you see on the dwarven

789
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:59,257
arm is white, like bright white. The female hand
comes out is thin, but the skin looks a little

790
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:01,038
softer and younger.

791
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,917
TRAVIS: Female elven, or is this female--

792
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,425
LIAM: The daughter.

793
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:07,822
TRAVIS: Who said three?

794
00:59:07,822 --> 00:59:13,942
MATT: At this point, the dwarf voice goes,
(incoherent semi-cursing).

795
00:59:13,942 --> 00:59:19,611
TRAVIS: I know, look, it's always lucky number
three, right? That's what they say. Who says that?

796
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:26,025
MATT: "Racist little-- peh!" And the arms just
withdraw, and the woman, "That's me, that's me."

797
00:59:26,025 --> 00:59:29,365
TRAVIS: Oh good. Hi. You look nice.

798
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:37,044
MATT: Look down, you see a young woman, maybe in
her late teens, early twenties, long brown hair,

799
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:43,470
tangled, covering one half of her face. You can
see the edges of her lips are cracked from just

800
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:49,584
dryness and lack of moisture. She's wearing, both
of them actually are wearing just these long,

801
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:55,015
simple cloth drape-over robes that are just,
y'know, for any prisoners in here that need to not

802
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:56,533
be wearing their normal clothing.

803
00:59:56,533 --> 01:00:00,146
TRAVIS: I've got three other goblets left, can I
both give them a goblet and some ale, just to wet

804
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:02,031
their lips and get a drink in?

805
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,779
MATT: They eagerly take it and begin scarfing it
down, the dwarf's like, "Oh! That's nothing!" You

806
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:13,123
can look at the dwarf now, he's elderly,
crotchety, half-blind, one clouded eye, but for

807
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:17,346
being a man who's been stuck in prison and slowly
dying, he's got this wry grin on him at all times.

808
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:21,494
TRAVIS: You're turning away good ale. Looks like
you've seen many a moon.

809
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:27,161
MATT: "You're telling me that. But no, seriously,
that's like half full. Come on, don't be stingy!"

810
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:31,180
TRAVIS: I like your gall. And I pour more ale in.

811
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:37,953
MATT: "That's the ticket!" It's like spilling on
the sides and getting stuck in his bright, bushy

812
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:43,691
white beard, and each bit that dribbles down, he
goes-- catches it and then pushes it back in, not

813
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:45,567
wasting a single drop.

814
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:51,457
TRAVIS: Beautiful. If you don't mind, ladies
first, love, what is your name? Why are you in here?

815
01:00:51,457 --> 01:01:05,209
MATT: "It's Amelia. I was taken because they
were-- the beasts were dealing with an uprising

816
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:12,602
"from some of us farm folk and, well, they took me
as leverage in the argument. Stopped their--

817
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,696
"stopped their arguing."

818
01:01:15,696 --> 01:01:18,657
TRAVIS: You're-- you're farm folk?

819
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:20,627
MATT: "Yeah."

820
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:23,148
TRAVIS: Do you have any family?

821
01:01:23,148 --> 01:01:24,741
MATT: "I do."

822
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:26,255
TRAVIS: What are their names?

823
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,208
MATT: "There's my father Reginald."

824
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,910
LAURA: Oh no!

825
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:35,873
TRAVIS: Sorry, I had a bit of split pea soup
that's just disagreeing with me, it's all right. Yep.

826
01:01:35,873 --> 01:01:38,077
MATT: "Are they okay, have you seen them? Have you
seen any of the people out there?"

827
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:47,740
TRAVIS: No, I-- we should get you out of here,
there's really bad stuff going on outside, we're

828
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,388
trying to get everyone out of the town.

829
01:01:50,388 --> 01:01:54,747
MATT: And you hear a voice down the way say,
"Everyone out of the town? That sounds like a

830
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:59,929
"great plan." And the dwarf behind you is like,
"Well then, get us out! I'm sick of this cell!"

831
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:10,443
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a minute, hold on. And so like.
Hold on. Can I try the keys on Amelia's cell?

832
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:17,151
MATT: Mm-hmm. You go through the keyring, which
probably has a good 40 or so different keys on it.

833
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:18,230
TRAVIS: Shit.

834
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,274
MATT: And so you go through one, two, three, four,
yeah.

835
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:23,883
LIAM: Six, six, six.

836
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:27,877
MATT: (laughs) And what would be the late teens,
and for what to you seems like forever, one key

837
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:33,226
does (squeaking) in the lock and it opens. She,
who's been like sitting down the whole time,

838
01:02:33,226 --> 01:02:38,620
stands up weakly and grabs the bars and pulls
herself up and waits for you to let her through if

839
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,388
she does, just being patient.

840
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:45,559
TRAVIS: Amelia, if you would, please stay with me.
Funny, I believe I heard of a man named Reginald.

841
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:50,099
Very brave. Not sure where he is, but we're going
to get you out of the city, just stay put for a

842
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,025
moment.

843
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:52,193
MATT: "Okay."

844
01:02:52,193 --> 01:02:54,675
TRAVIS: All right, you, you salty bastard, what's
your name?

845
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,696
MATT: "Old Davin. What's your name?"

846
01:02:57,696 --> 01:03:03,382
TRAVIS: Lord Grog. Emphasis on the Lord.

847
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:05,584
MATT: "Lord Grog."

848
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:06,958
TRAVIS: Yeah.

849
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,972
MATT: "Lord of?"

850
01:03:08,972 --> 01:03:12,876
TRAVIS: The Vales of Strongjaw.

851
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:16,111
MATT: "I'll take it, that's fine. Get me out,
please?"

852
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:24,343
TRAVIS: Right. Oh, keys. Can I take the keyring
and can I pry the metal keyring-- is it like one

853
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:27,453
solid piece or is it the kind that I could maybe
bend it open?

854
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:31,292
MATT: I mean, it is one solid piece that has been
looped twice, but it has been-- the iron itself

855
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:37,176
has been bent around itself to make it nice and
tight, form-fit on one end. Go ahead and make a

856
01:03:37,176 --> 01:03:38,756
strength check.

857
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:42,830
TRAVIS: 26.

858
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:52,672
MATT: Ping. (laughs) Like, you were preparing
yourself for a full pull, and with but a minor

859
01:03:52,672 --> 01:03:55,154
twitch of your muscles it just bends open.

860
01:03:55,154 --> 01:04:00,194
TRAVIS: Can I take half the keys and give them to
Amelia and say, love, would you go and let out the

861
01:04:00,194 --> 01:04:05,665
kind gentleman with the reddish beard and the
little blood on his mouth named Abjurist, would

862
01:04:05,665 --> 01:04:12,056
you try these keys and see if his cell will open?
Not yet for Mr. Blackfoot across the way.

863
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:16,055
MATT: "Right. I will, I will." She rushes off and
starts fumbling through the keys, and you hear in

864
01:04:16,055 --> 01:04:19,313
the distance her making her way through the keys
as--

865
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:24,195
TRAVIS: I take the other half and start trying to
get Da-- what was his name?

866
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:25,336
MATT: Old Davin.

867
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:26,868
TRAVIS: Old, I like old.

868
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:28,653
LAURA: Have we met Old Davin?

869
01:04:28,653 --> 01:04:30,454
MATT: You have not met Old Davin, no.

870
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:33,038
TRAVIS: Okay. Davin, what did you get put in here
for?

871
01:04:33,038 --> 01:04:40,344
MATT: "Right if I know! Got real drunk and woke up
in here, everyone started screaming and running

872
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:47,122
"away, and I'm like ahh, run away you pansies, and
they did, ran away, they never came back. Some

873
01:04:47,122 --> 01:04:55,153
"packed fire, but not a problem now." And yes, the
one snowblind eye doesn't move at all, the other

874
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:57,809
one glances around, that one's completely stuck in
a forward position.

875
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,287
TRAVIS: Is that magic?

876
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:03,320
MATT: "I mean, certainly gets the ladies."

877
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,851
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does.

878
01:05:04,851 --> 01:05:10,834
MATT: "But no, it's a reminder to not, well, to
not mess with your people."

879
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:15,297
TRAVIS: Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But they
do make you look very young.

880
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:16,700
MATT: "Much worse, say I."

881
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,351
TRAVIS: Now if we let you out of here, right,
which we're actually in the process of doing, what

882
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:23,031
is your weapon of choice?

883
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:32,654
MATT: "Oh, oh." And he thinks to himself for a
moment. "I would have to say my weapon of choice

884
01:05:32,654 --> 01:05:37,641
"would be Bloodvine ale. Aye."

885
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,684
TRAVIS: Bloodvine ale?

886
01:05:39,684 --> 01:05:41,741
MATT: "Aye, if we're picking poison, that's my
favorite."

887
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:45,405
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, my-- He's a dwarf, right?

888
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:46,456
MATT: Yeah.

889
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:53,596
TRAVIS: Yeah. Obviously we are brothers of the
beard. Like, to fight with, right?

890
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:55,645
MATT: "Oh, that kills, eh?"

891
01:05:55,645 --> 01:05:58,188
TRAVIS: Yeah, stab, poke, enchant, whatever.

892
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:04,622
MATT: "Once upon a time I was quite a duelist, so
if you got something pointy and prickling I can

893
01:06:04,622 --> 01:06:06,348
"spear 'em with the best of them."

894
01:06:06,348 --> 01:06:10,064
TRAVIS: I do have a Greatsword of Frenzy, but it's
a two-handed weapon.

895
01:06:10,064 --> 01:06:12,514
MATT: "Ah, that's not my preference."

896
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:20,008
TRAVIS: I do also have one regular, just a regular
longsword. About the best I have.

897
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,920
MATT: "Yeah, that'll do, certainly, I'll take a
longsword."

898
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,955
TRAVIS: All right, so. Have I got the door open
yet?

899
01:06:25,955 --> 01:06:30,545
MATT: Not yet. But at this time there's an awkward
pause and now you're like, don't have any more

900
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:35,095
conversation. But you still have to finish the--
about a minute later, he's sitting there going,

901
01:06:35,095 --> 01:06:39,649
"Come on, come on, come on." Eventually-- tink!--
it opens up. "Yes!" And he pushes it open as you

902
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:40,885
pull it open.

903
01:06:40,885 --> 01:06:42,939
TRAVIS: Before I give you this sword--

904
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:43,876
MATT: "Aye?"

905
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:46,091
TRAVIS: --are you up for the fight of your life?

906
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,251
MATT: "Yes?"

907
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:49,703
TRAVIS: Can I insight check him?

908
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:51,250
MATT: Yes, you may.

909
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:56,898
TRAVIS: This is going to go really well. Eight!
Nine!

910
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:59,352
LIAM: Go Tarv, go Tarv.

911
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:03,900
MATT: He seems a little--

912
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,637
SAM: Scottish.

913
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:09,989
(laughter)

914
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:15,965
MATT: He seems a little malnourished, and a little
confused.

915
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,151
TRAVIS: Right.

916
01:07:17,151 --> 01:07:20,394
MATT: But nothing sets you off as untrustworthy.

917
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:28,309
TRAVIS: Look, your expression says a lot. What if
I put an excellent meal in your belly, sharpened

918
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:33,713
that sword some more, would you like to fight for
some glory come the morrow?

919
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:38,245
MATT: "Sure. Why not?"

920
01:07:38,245 --> 01:07:45,780
TRAVIS: That's what I thought. If you would go
join Amelia, I have to get my good friend Abjurist

921
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,513
Noja out of his cell and then we're going to go
have a meeting, because there's going to be a big

922
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:53,683
feast tonight, it's going to be delicious.

923
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:57,083
MATT: "Oh, great, I'll be there for that, aye.
Where's it happening?"

924
01:07:57,083 --> 01:08:03,975
TRAVIS: You know, it's very secret, yep. Secret
location, TBD.

925
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:10,433
MATT: "Right, right. I'll wait for you." And he
walks out, taking the keys from you as he runs off

926
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:11,734
toward Amelia.

927
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,568
TRAVIS: Now, has she gotten Abjurist out?

928
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:16,871
MATT: At this point, yeah, Noja has
stepped out of the cell and is putting an arm on

929
01:08:16,871 --> 01:08:21,046
her, you see he's actually having a hard time
standing and she's helping support him, even

930
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:22,558
though she's having a hard time standing.

931
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:23,732
(Skype noise)

932
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:24,890
MATT: There goes Taliesin.

933
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:28,093
TRAVIS: Man, I know a lot of people that are going
to be really, really happy to see you.

934
01:08:28,093 --> 01:08:37,640
MATT: "Ah. Really? Well, I'm very happy to see
these people, anybody really, that're not the

935
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,934
"inside of this blasted prison." (coughs)

936
01:08:39,934 --> 01:08:41,424
(Skype rings)

937
01:08:41,424 --> 01:08:42,671
LIAM: Oh, get him, get him!

938
01:08:42,671 --> 01:08:44,042
LAURA: Quick, answer it!

939
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,006
LIAM: Stupid tinkerer.

940
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:47,369
SAM: I'm trying, I'm trying!

941
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:50,307
LIAM: Percival and his technology.

942
01:08:50,307 --> 01:08:51,686
MATT: There we go. Welcome back.

943
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:52,930
LAURA: Hi Percy.

944
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:53,882
TALIESIN: Hi.

945
01:08:53,882 --> 01:09:03,882
TRAVIS: Could I ask you a question? So I have this
new axe, right, it's really nice. I got it off the

946
01:09:03,882 --> 01:09:12,277
leader of goliaths, real prick. It's really strong
and I've known about it for years, there's

947
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:17,338
nothing, like, funny about-- Actually, if I give
this to you, would you just tell me if you, like,

948
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:18,718
hear anything?

949
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:23,825
MATT: "Ah, they took my spellbook when they threw
me in here."

950
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:24,883
TRAVIS: Oh.

951
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:28,446
MATT: "If we could find that, maybe I can help
you."

952
01:09:28,446 --> 01:09:29,936
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

953
01:09:29,936 --> 01:09:33,860
MATT: "Otherwise, I'm out of tricks, friend,
sorry."

954
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:39,210
TRAVIS: All right. I turn around to Orn Blackfoot
and I'm like, "All right, mate. Last chance. Why

955
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,995
"should I let you out?"

956
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:55,984
MATT: "Because I can be a good friend and help you
out. I can get you money and women and travel

957
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,481
"anywhere you wish."

958
01:09:57,481 --> 01:10:01,141
TRAVIS: I've done all three of those things more
than most men do in three lifetimes.

959
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:06,525
MATT: "And you can have a fourth! Please, just let
me out of here."

960
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:11,457
TRAVIS: I'm thinking of a number between one and
three.

961
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,895
SAM: He's not.

962
01:10:12,895 --> 01:10:13,829
MATT: "Two."

963
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:14,804
TRAVIS: Shit.

964
01:10:14,804 --> 01:10:16,396
(laughter)

965
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:21,666
TRAVIS: That's like only one of a couple that I
know. All right. You get to come out.

966
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:27,007
MATT: "Ah, wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank
you. And I'm a man of my word, don't you worry."

967
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:29,176
TRAVIS: Can I insight check if he's a man of his
word?

968
01:10:29,176 --> 01:10:30,402
MATT: Go for it.

969
01:10:30,402 --> 01:10:34,141
TRAVIS: Roll better. Shit fuck balls ass. Three.

970
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:36,681
MATT: Three. Seems legit.

971
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:39,076
(laughter)

972
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:43,201
TRAVIS: You have a face that is truly trustworthy.
And I start looking for the key to his cell.

973
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:48,471
MATT: Okay. At this point, you've run through the
ring enough, you can go ahead and take it from Old

974
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:53,907
Davin. Over time you eventually get him free, and
as soon as you do, he stretches, cracks his back a

975
01:10:53,907 --> 01:11:00,900
bit. "All right. Thank you kindly. So. Let's be
off." And he charges up next to Noja and then

976
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:06,224
breezes past them and you guys all exit the
outside of the Iron Stocks.

977
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:07,954
LAURA: Look for Noja's book, look for Noja's
book.

978
01:11:07,954 --> 01:11:13,260
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, well. Noja, Noja, is there a
location where your spellbook was last? (belches)

979
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:23,025
MATT: "They took it from me when they arrested me.
I don't know where they would have put it."

980
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:28,155
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, goliaths are awfully fond of
books. Let's go find out, shall we? And we go back

981
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:31,397
towards where I guess everybody last was.

982
01:11:31,397 --> 01:11:37,784
MATT: Okay. On the way there, Noja's like, "I do
have one of my older spellbooks, wouldn't have all

983
01:11:37,784 --> 01:11:41,931
"of my materials, but that would be back at my shop
if we ever have a chance to stop by."

984
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,991
TRAVIS: Well, we could go there now if you'd
like.

985
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:45,635
MATT: "Certainly."

986
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,868
TRAVIS: How far is it from here? I forget, it's
been a few years.

987
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:56,651
MATT: "Oh, it's about-- just due east of where the
temples are, about 25, 30 minutes up that way."

988
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:59,969
TRAVIS: Hold that thought. I grab my earring and I
say, can anybody hear me?

989
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:01,855
SAM: Can we?

990
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:05,993
MATT: At this point, yeah, the Stocks aren't too
far. Whoever's--

991
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,142
TALIESIN: Yes.

992
01:12:07,142 --> 01:12:08,400
LAURA: What's up, Grog?

993
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,741
TRAVIS: Right, so. What if I told you I found
somebody's name that rhymes with Daburish Koja?

994
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:18,420
LIAM: You found Dabney Coleman?

995
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,086
LAURA: Dabdrist Cojo?

996
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,693
TRAVIS: It's Abjurist Noja.

997
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:24,279
ALL: Oh!

998
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:29,657
MARISHA: Man, I didn't realize 'til now how many
people we actually know whose name rhymes with that.

999
01:12:29,657 --> 01:12:31,570
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're like really important.

1000
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,002
MARISHA: Yeah, we know a lot of people.

1001
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:35,732
TRAVIS: So I'm going to take him to find his
spellbook, because I feel like he could be a great--

1002
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:37,205
TALIESIN: I don't recall this person.

1003
01:12:37,205 --> 01:12:38,282
TRAVIS: You don't?

1004
01:12:38,282 --> 01:12:39,804
MARISHA: Weren't you with us, Percy?

1005
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:43,526
MATT: Yeah, Percy met him.

1006
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,272
TALIESIN: Was I?

1007
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:49,370
MARISHA: Yeah, remember the guy who saved us at
the first Winter's Crest festival?

1008
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,018
TALIESIN: Oh yes, no, he was quite lovely.

1009
01:12:51,018 --> 01:12:52,416
MARISHA: Yeah, he's very nice.

1010
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:56,404
TRAVIS: Yeah, I found him. I'm going to get him a
spellbook. Does anybody want to come with, or are

1011
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:57,688
you all good?

1012
01:12:57,688 --> 01:13:00,124
MARISHA: I'm about to dig a trench, so I'll pass.

1013
01:13:00,124 --> 01:13:02,697
LIAM: Keyleth, where are you right now?

1014
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:09,766
MARISHA: Heading northeast towards, northwest,
northwest. Sorry. It's noon, it's hard to tell in

1015
01:13:09,766 --> 01:13:12,512
the sky right now. Northwest.

1016
01:13:12,512 --> 01:13:14,054
LAURA: Are you with us, Pike?

1017
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:15,529
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

1018
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:16,873
LAURA: Pike's with us.

1019
01:13:16,873 --> 01:13:18,560
ASHLEY: I'm done attuning?

1020
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,453
MATT: Yeah, the attunement takes about an hour or
so, half an hour to an hour.

1021
01:13:21,453 --> 01:13:23,124
ASHLEY: Yeah, I just found you guys, just hanging
out.

1022
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:25,804
LAURA: Hey, what's up. You want to help us clear
some stuff?

1023
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:27,750
ASHLEY: You need some help? Yeah, let me help you,
I'm so strong.

1024
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,223
SAM: Um, Grog, I can come with you, Grog, if you
need some help.

1025
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:32,215
TRAVIS: Yes. The cube is always welcome.

1026
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:36,921
LIAM: My. Goodness. Gracious.

1027
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:39,894
TRAVIS: Please. It's more like a Coke can. Okay.
Um.

1028
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:40,920
LIAM: A what?

1029
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,424
TRAVIS: What? So, Scanlan, if you want to come
meet us, we're over by the Iron thing. How would I

1030
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,797
tell him where we are?

1031
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:51,661
MATT: Iron Stocks, you can describe it to him and
eventually he'll find his way there.

1032
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,932
TRAVIS: I'm over by this thing balalalala.

1033
01:13:53,932 --> 01:13:56,152
SAM: Excellent description, I'm on my way.

1034
01:13:56,152 --> 01:13:58,726
MATT: (laughs) And you've been to the town before,
you guys have spent some time in Westruun, so you

1035
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:05,239
know the basics around. So you manage to meet up
with these fellas and you make your way northward

1036
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:15,838
into the outskirts of Noja's shop. Noja's shop is
untouched by the battle, it seems, still stands.

1037
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:17,990
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Really?

1038
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:23,813
MATT: He walks up and the door's open and looks
inside and just sighs heavily, as the interior of

1039
01:14:23,813 --> 01:14:25,719
this place has been picked clean.

1040
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:28,499
MARISHA: Ah, son of a fucking-- looters!

1041
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:34,801
SAM: Noja, were there any hidden compartments or
secret safes where you kept the good stuff?

1042
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:41,189
MATT: "Well. Follow me." And he heads towards the
back of the shop, heads into a room in the side

1043
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:47,322
which contains his bed and his personal setup.
That door's kicked in, there was a lock on it, the

1044
01:14:47,322 --> 01:14:52,063
lock's still hanging as part of the door
contraption as the actual door was just kicked

1045
01:14:52,063 --> 01:14:59,580
inward and the wood splintered and left open. He
steps inside, feels above the doorway. There's a

1046
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:05,855
panel of wood that he pulls aside and brings out.
There is a singular book, where he pulls it out

1047
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:12,020
and sighs, blows dust off it. "Ah, this is a bit
rudimentary for what I require, but it's

1048
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:19,424
"something, it's better than nothing." Puts it
aside, manages to find some pieces of his clothing

1049
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:23,754
that have been tossed onto the floor as a heap or,
you know, raiding the room and gets out of his

1050
01:15:23,754 --> 01:15:29,229
prison robes and puts them over that to just go
ahead and not be as tattered as he looked. He does

1051
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:39,360
pull what looks like a small jug from it and sets
that aside, and he looks around his room, (sighs)

1052
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:52,509
"I guess let's see if there's anything in the shop
that still remains." Steps around the way. Oof.

1053
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:57,262
All right. Yeah, most everything of worth appears
to have been taken or broken.

1054
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,994
LAURA: Search around, help him search!

1055
01:15:58,994 --> 01:16:01,559
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there anything we can help you
find that you're looking for?

1056
01:16:01,559 --> 01:16:04,776
MATT: "Anything intact, really."

1057
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:06,971
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we help him look for any vials,
or--

1058
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:08,726
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1059
01:16:08,726 --> 01:16:11,424
TRAVIS: Better. 17.

1060
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:12,558
SAM: 16.

1061
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:18,470
MATT: 16, okay. Looking around, most everything is
ruined, destroyed, or missing, however you do find

1062
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:29,060
what looks to be two unspoiled, undestroyed vials
that were part of a display set that has been

1063
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:33,312
tossed over the side. Most of the fluid contained
in these vials, like corks have been left open,

1064
01:16:33,312 --> 01:16:37,440
glass and crystal have been shattered, and the
contents had just stained the floor and dried over

1065
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:43,757
time into little sticky pools of different colors.
You do find two, one of which is a yellowish fluid

1066
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:58,158
that's streaked with black swirls, and there is
one that it's like a clear liquid that has a-- the

1067
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:04,502
liquid itself fills the vial and then shrinks down
to a tiny bead and then expands again to fill the

1068
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:08,206
vial, like a very, very slow heartbeat. Those are
the two that you find.

1069
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,514
TRAVIS: What?

1070
01:17:09,514 --> 01:17:13,013
MARISHA: Yellow with black swirls, and then a
clear potion that--

1071
01:17:13,013 --> 01:17:22,557
SAM: Oh, he'll just tell us, I assume. Sir, we're
about to embark on a deadly adventure to try to

1072
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:28,671
clear this town so that you can once again live
here safely. Might we trouble you to borrow these

1073
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:31,601
potions if they can be in some way helpful to us?

1074
01:17:31,601 --> 01:17:35,541
MATT: "You've done me great service by getting me
out of that hellhole. You are welcome to take

1075
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:40,419
"these with you for now. I guess I have to start
from scratch..."

1076
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:41,877
SAM: Do you know what they are?

1077
01:17:41,877 --> 01:17:45,943
MATT: "Oh, yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry." And he
takes the vials and looks at them. "Ah, this is a

1078
01:17:45,943 --> 01:17:50,160
"Potion of Diminution. It shrinks you to a smaller
size."

1079
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,686
SAM: Oh, I could be small! Oh, wait.

1080
01:17:52,686 --> 01:17:58,859
MATT: "It only lasts for a few hours, depending,
the magic isn't perfect, but it does make you

1081
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:06,468
"smaller. This other one, this vial contains a
liquid that will make you quite speedier. It will

1082
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:11,066
"increase your metabolism for a short time, the
world around you seems to slow, it's quite

1083
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,533
"effective."

1084
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:15,900
SAM: Thank you so, so much.

1085
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,503
TRAVIS: Yeah actually, have you ever seen this
shrinking potion work, like, how small does

1086
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:21,991
something get?

1087
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:29,162
MATT: "Pretty small. Like, if on your size--" And he
makes a shape of about that big.

1088
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,805
SAM: So teeny-tiny.

1089
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:33,448
MATT: "For you, yes. For you, you'd be about his
size."

1090
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:44,326
TRAVIS: That would be the best thing ever. Now
that you've found-- I'm sorry, go ahead.

1091
01:18:44,326 --> 01:18:49,670
SAM: No no no. This is most helpful. Do you know
anywhere also around here where we might pick up

1092
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:53,957
some chains, hooks, spears, javelins?

1093
01:18:53,957 --> 01:18:56,508
MATT: "Ah, those are not my forte, my apologies."

1094
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:57,551
SAM: All right.

1095
01:18:57,551 --> 01:18:59,158
MARISHA: Should've took those from the prison.

1096
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:03,978
MATT: "I mean, check a general goods store,
perhaps?"

1097
01:19:03,978 --> 01:19:06,499
SAM: Oh no, this is so helpful, thank you, let me
go get those.

1098
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:07,959
MATT: So here are your potions.

1099
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:11,911
TRAVIS: That book that you got, it's not your
favorite, right, the one that was hidden above the door?

1100
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:18,429
MATT: "No, no, but it'll do, at least. Do you wish
me to inspect that weapon for you?"

1101
01:19:18,429 --> 01:19:22,452
TRAVIS: Yeah, would you mind? I've never done that
before, but the last one I had talked to me.

1102
01:19:22,452 --> 01:19:26,207
MATT: "That's... unsettling. That's very
unsettling."

1103
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,662
TRAVIS: Yeah, among other things.

1104
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:32,421
MATT: The dwarf and the woman are still waiting at
the door, they've picked through things and

1105
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:38,361
they're finding bits of broken glass and over time
they can't find anything else. He takes the hour

1106
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:45,599
to rest and regains, after some quick preparation,
the use of at least his Identify spell. Takes the

1107
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:50,894
axe, holds it for a moment, chants some
incantation that you don't understand. There's a

1108
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:55,454
brief glow on the weapon, and around the outskirts
of his fingers, a brief glow around his temples.

1109
01:19:55,454 --> 01:20:03,451
As it fades, he goes, "Hm. Well, if what you worry
about is the presence of some sort of sentience, I

1110
01:20:03,451 --> 01:20:09,503
"can assure you, you need not worry. This is merely
a tool, and a powerful one at that." And he begins

1111
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:12,756
to tell you what it does, which is exactly what
you already know after attunement.

1112
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:14,682
TRAVIS: No long card coming? (laughs)

1113
01:20:14,682 --> 01:20:15,641
MATT: No.

1114
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:22,337
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. Thank you, Abjurist, you
are as wise as you are. Old.

1115
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:23,846
MARISHA: Old? (laughs)

1116
01:20:23,846 --> 01:20:29,052
MATT: "I'm only 48, but thank you."

1117
01:20:29,052 --> 01:20:32,016
TRAVIS: That's lost on me. Do you need anything
else?

1118
01:20:32,016 --> 01:20:40,620
SAM: Oh, oi, oi, I was just-- I'm enthralled by
these potions, they're fantastic, and I'm

1119
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:45,369
enthralled and so happy that we met you again and
all that. I totally remembered who you were.

1120
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:49,294
(laughter)

1121
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:56,556
MATT: "It's good to see that you're all doing
fine, considering the circumstances. Stay safe.

1122
01:20:56,556 --> 01:20:59,411
"I'll pick up what pieces I can."

1123
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:03,908
SAM: Should you get-- should we tell him to get
out of the city or fight with us?

1124
01:21:03,908 --> 01:21:08,202
TRAVIS: Well, I was going to ask, you do know what
is beset upon this city, right? The horrible

1125
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:09,818
calamity that's coming?

1126
01:21:09,818 --> 01:21:12,106
MATT: "I saw the dragon tear through, yes."

1127
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:19,154
SAM: We aim to finish the dragon, maybe even
tomorrow, and make Westruun free once again. Would

1128
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:24,863
you have any interest in aiding us in this fight,
or are you past the point of putting up a brave

1129
01:21:24,863 --> 01:21:26,355
battle?

1130
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:30,030
MATT: And you see him standing there, even just
standing here this time, his knees are wobbling a

1131
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:34,623
bit, and he goes, "I'm afraid I wouldn't be of
much aid at this moment without my proper

1132
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:41,261
"spellbook. I have a few child's treats at my
disposal." And he sifts through a few pages and he

1133
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:47,347
seems to-- the book looks like it's pretty old,
like probably his training manual when he first

1134
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:52,807
began to study as a practitioner of the magical
arts. "I don't know how much use I'd be,

1135
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,206
"unfortunately."

1136
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:59,703
TRAVIS: The day's still young. What say we give,
like, a solid effort to finding your bigger books,

1137
01:21:59,703 --> 01:22:04,947
and then if you can't find it and you can lend no
aid to us, we'll make sure you find yourself

1138
01:22:04,947 --> 01:22:06,465
safely on your way?

1139
01:22:06,465 --> 01:22:15,017
MATT: "All right. All right, fair enough. Well
come, let us look. Perhaps we should give another

1140
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:20,063
"once-over of the rather seemingly destroyed
interior of that prison."

1141
01:22:20,063 --> 01:22:22,451
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1142
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:28,933
MATT: Looks like Amelia and Old Davin have nothing
else better to do, they begin to aid you for a

1143
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:32,761
bit, although Amelia is eager, and mentions the
possibility of going and checking in on the

1144
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:36,254
farmsteads on the outside of town.

1145
01:22:36,254 --> 01:22:39,312
MARISHA: Yeah. About that.

1146
01:22:39,312 --> 01:22:42,408
MATT: Orn? Orn Blackfoot? Gone.

1147
01:22:42,408 --> 01:22:44,330
MARISHA: Yeah, figured that much.

1148
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,566
MATT: He has peaced.

1149
01:22:45,566 --> 01:22:47,361
TRAVIS: He left.

1150
01:22:47,361 --> 01:22:50,760
MATT: Yeah. You guys take a moment, and when you
start deciding what to do, and you look around and

1151
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,213
he's just gone.

1152
01:22:52,213 --> 01:22:53,442
SAM: I thought you had him.

1153
01:22:53,442 --> 01:22:57,762
TRAVIS: I thought you had him. I clearly said when
you came up, watch the guy with the black feet.

1154
01:22:57,762 --> 01:22:58,871
What'd you do?

1155
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:02,402
SAM: I was watching you, you have disgusting black
feet. You walk around barefoot, you're

1156
01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:03,504
disgusting.

1157
01:23:03,504 --> 01:23:06,676
TRAVIS: I really can't argue with that.

1158
01:23:06,676 --> 01:23:09,628
(laughter)

1159
01:23:09,628 --> 01:23:19,626
TRAVIS: Well. Whatever. I saved a life, go me.
I'll take it later. Yeah, so can we go back to the

1160
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:25,428
prison, not to take away from everything else, and
maybe look for chains, like some hooks, maybe some

1161
01:23:25,428 --> 01:23:26,753
broken bars?

1162
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:30,808
MATT: Yeah. The two of you guys, make one more
investigation check, this'll signify the next few

1163
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:32,953
hours of looking for the things you want.

1164
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:34,624
LAURA: Oh god, roll really good.

1165
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:35,559
SAM: 22.

1166
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:36,579
TRAVIS: 19.

1167
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:44,454
MATT: Between the two of you, working into and
past dusk, you manage to acquire quite a number of

1168
01:23:44,454 --> 01:23:51,056
chains. It's funny, a prison seems to have a lot
at their disposal. They have a queue of chains

1169
01:23:51,056 --> 01:23:55,170
that are used of various lengths, some of them may
have to be put together to make the length of

1170
01:23:55,170 --> 01:24:02,612
which you're looking for, but between ramshackle
manacles to just lengths of chain that are used to

1171
01:24:02,612 --> 01:24:08,692
opening gates and used to seal elements of the
subterranean portion of this prison, you manage to

1172
01:24:08,692 --> 01:24:15,496
acquire quite a bit. You do, towards the end of
the evening, manage to find partially destroyed

1173
01:24:15,496 --> 01:24:21,408
remnants of Noja's spellbook. He seems a little
disappointed as soon as he sees the state it's in,

1174
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:24,452
a lot of the pages have been burnt and torn out of
these--

1175
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:25,824
TRAVIS: I am sorry.

1176
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:32,849
MATT: "Ah, it's all right, there are some here
that are of use to me. And if I can be of any

1177
01:24:32,849 --> 01:24:39,121
"assistance tomorrow in this fray, hopefully at a
distance-- How big is this dragon, you said?"

1178
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:41,906
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like seven feet.

1179
01:24:41,906 --> 01:24:46,711
MATT: "Oh, well then I can definitely be of help
there, not a worry, all right. I'll prepare myself

1180
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:48,167
"best I can."

1181
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,820
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll make sure, we'll keep you on
the outsides with those that are not, you know,

1182
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,451
can't take a good walloping.

1183
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:56,761
SAM: Do you have any healing potions or anything,
or I mean, I'm sorry, healing spells?

1184
01:24:56,761 --> 01:25:00,864
MATT: "That's not my specialty, I fear, and the
potions I had are now soaking in the floorboards

1185
01:25:00,864 --> 01:25:03,378
"of my humble shop."

1186
01:25:03,378 --> 01:25:07,050
TRAVIS: Not that I would understand, but could you
tell us what your specialty is?

1187
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:12,196
MATT: "Abjuration, of course. That's the school of
magic of which my--" (laughs)

1188
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:13,701
SAM: I'm familiar with that.

1189
01:25:13,701 --> 01:25:18,434
TRAVIS: Abjur--yeah. Mm-hmm. No idea what that
means.

1190
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:20,449
LIAM: Like Claymation.

1191
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:24,200
TRAVIS: Oh, like puppets. I'm a big fan of
puppets.

1192
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,595
SAM: All right, well, we'll get some rest, try to
put the pieces of your place back together.

1193
01:25:28,595 --> 01:25:34,513
MATT: "I will. Come to me when the time is ready
to face this fiend, this foul creature, and I'm

1194
01:25:34,513 --> 01:25:36,009
"happy to help."

1195
01:25:36,009 --> 01:25:37,379
SAM: Good night.

1196
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:39,808
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we should probably make him a
part of the feast.

1197
01:25:39,808 --> 01:25:42,063
SAM: Oh. All right.

1198
01:25:42,063 --> 01:25:43,841
TRAVIS: We'll come get you later tonight.

1199
01:25:43,841 --> 01:25:45,246
MATT: "All right."

1200
01:25:45,246 --> 01:25:47,977
LIAM: I'm going to track down the women after
talking to them over the earring.

1201
01:25:47,977 --> 01:25:49,214
MATT: Okay.

1202
01:25:49,214 --> 01:25:56,223
LIAM: Straight from Percival, once I catch sight
of them, can I talk to you for a minute?

1203
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:57,949
MARISHA: Sure.

1204
01:25:57,949 --> 01:25:59,811
LIAM: Just a minute, I know you're busy. Um.

1205
01:25:59,811 --> 01:26:01,407
LAURA: She's super busy, brother!

1206
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:03,889
LIAM: Yeah, two minutes. Two minutes. Um.

1207
01:26:03,889 --> 01:26:05,193
LAURA: So busy.

1208
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:12,621
LIAM: Thanks, Stubbs. You're way more powerful
than I am, and I don't know what I'm going to--

1209
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:13,871
(Skype noise)

1210
01:26:13,871 --> 01:26:14,914
SAM: God dammit.

1211
01:26:14,914 --> 01:26:16,121
LIAM: What's that sound?

1212
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:17,558
MARISHA: So many noises happening.

1213
01:26:17,558 --> 01:26:21,252
LIAM: You're going to be doing a lot more damage
than I am tomorrow, it's not like I'm going to run

1214
01:26:21,252 --> 01:26:27,838
up and stab the thing in the back. I feel like
you're probably going to be too busy to be using

1215
01:26:27,838 --> 01:26:29,860
Fassbender--

1216
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:32,819
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want Fassbender? I was
actually going to offer him to you, 'cause I feel

1217
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:34,159
like you might--

1218
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,919
LIAM: I think I want to be of use, so yeah.

1219
01:26:36,919 --> 01:26:40,405
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure you don't have to worry
about that.

1220
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:42,763
LAURA: (gagging)

1221
01:26:42,763 --> 01:26:46,145
LIAM: So it just goes on the head, then how does
it work, what do you, what do I talk to it or do I

1222
01:26:46,145 --> 01:26:47,408
think it or what do I do?

1223
01:26:47,408 --> 01:26:52,681
MARISHA: So you give it a command, it takes your
full concentration to give it a command, and then

1224
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:58,552
once you do that it will enact that plan until
it's complete or until you tell it otherwise.

1225
01:26:58,552 --> 01:26:59,797
LIAM: All right.

1226
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:03,903
MARISHA: And if you wanted to cast a Slow spell,
just, you have to focus and tell it to do that.

1227
01:27:03,903 --> 01:27:06,182
LIAM: Okay. Do I say like, slow?

1228
01:27:06,182 --> 01:27:13,245
MARISHA: You know, I don't know. Just wing it. I
kept talking to him like it was a person and I

1229
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:15,657
don't think that's necessarily the way to go.

1230
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:17,897
LIAM: Maybe I'll prac-- where did you park him?

1231
01:27:17,897 --> 01:27:20,725
MARISHA: It's still in Scanlan's mansion.

1232
01:27:20,725 --> 01:27:22,109
LIAM: Oh.

1233
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:23,580
LAURA: Is that still there?

1234
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:24,938
SAM: Yes?

1235
01:27:24,938 --> 01:27:30,265
MATT: Well, based on the time that spell was cast,
the 24-hour duration has expired. All things in

1236
01:27:30,265 --> 01:27:32,279
the mansion have been jettisoned from the
doorway.

1237
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:34,583
LAURA: Including your grandad!

1238
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,071
MARISHA: So he's in Wilhand's house, with
Wilhand.

1239
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:38,982
LIAM: Great, well, I'll take that.

1240
01:27:38,982 --> 01:27:41,983
MARISHA: Yeah. Hopefully Wilhand's watching over
him right now, actually.

1241
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:44,070
SAM: It might have destroyed the house.

1242
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:47,941
MARISHA: It might've destroyed Wilhand's house.
Yeah.

1243
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:49,272
LIAM: Kiki.

1244
01:27:49,272 --> 01:27:50,808
MARISHA: Yes?

1245
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:52,374
(Skype noises)

1246
01:27:52,374 --> 01:27:53,643
LIAM: What is that?

1247
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,423
MARISHA: This is the weirdest field.

1248
01:27:55,423 --> 01:28:00,230
(Taliesin makes noises on Skype)

1249
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:03,964
(laughter)

1250
01:28:03,964 --> 01:28:06,274
LIAM: Percy. Tinker quietly, please.

1251
01:28:06,274 --> 01:28:09,086
(Taliesin makes louder noises on Skype)

1252
01:28:09,086 --> 01:28:11,861
(laughter)

1253
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:18,552
LIAM: I think he's eating popcorn, or maybe
opening a butterscotch candy in the theater.

1254
01:28:18,552 --> 01:28:21,003
TALIESIN: I can't even see you guys, are you
like?

1255
01:28:21,003 --> 01:28:26,448
LAURA: Oh, he went away! Aw, this is just not--

1256
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:28,265
LIAM: Okay, really quickly.

1257
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:30,009
LAURA: Okay. Well, at least he started.

1258
01:28:30,009 --> 01:28:37,174
MARISHA: Yes? This seems to happen all the time,
every time we try to talk to each other. I don't

1259
01:28:37,174 --> 01:28:40,602
think I've really, continue, continue. It's hard
to have a conversa--

1260
01:28:40,602 --> 01:28:41,993
TALIESIN: Hi.

1261
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:43,523
MATT: Continue, please.

1262
01:28:43,523 --> 01:28:45,384
LIAM: Hello, yeah, Percival, I'll talk to you in a
minute, all right?

1263
01:28:45,384 --> 01:28:46,836
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy. Thank you.

1264
01:28:46,836 --> 01:28:58,085
LIAM: Ah. I've been confused. I am confused. But.

1265
01:28:58,085 --> 01:29:02,031
And I take her by the hand.

1266
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:11,630
LIAM: It wasn't fair, last week. It wasn't fair to
you. And I'm sorry.

1267
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:13,415
MARISHA: What are you talking about?

1268
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:21,761
LIAM: In your room, in your room. Me leaving
wasn't--

1269
01:29:21,761 --> 01:29:23,139
MARISHA: When you left me, right--

1270
01:29:23,139 --> 01:29:24,377
LIAM: --wasn't fair.

1271
01:29:24,377 --> 01:29:26,368
MARISHA: Yeah, no, that I remember. Yeah, that.
Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

1272
01:29:26,368 --> 01:29:32,685
LIAM: That's it. I'm sorry.

1273
01:29:32,685 --> 01:29:43,073
MARISHA: I'm sorry if I dropped that on you, and
put any more undue stress, that's not what I want--

1274
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:45,123
LIAM: This is awful, all of it is awful.

1275
01:29:45,123 --> 01:29:50,531
MARISHA: This is awful. Yeah, no, this is pretty
bad. You know, I've actually been wanting to talk

1276
01:29:50,531 --> 01:30:03,881
to you. I wasn't entirely planning on now. I know
you've been struggling. I know you feel like

1277
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:25,105
you're drowning, and I'm sorry that the Raven
Queen chose you, but she did choose you. You know,

1278
01:30:25,105 --> 01:30:37,472
as druids, I was raised to have an interesting
perspective on the gods. We are taught that nature

1279
01:30:37,472 --> 01:30:50,663
is the one true powerful force. I have yet to see
a god control the sunrise and the sunset, so

1280
01:30:50,663 --> 01:31:00,192
therefore it's hard for me to sometimes have the
same faith in these gods. Personally, I believe

1281
01:31:00,192 --> 01:31:10,484
that just because you're immortal doesn't make you
infallible. These gods can be great ambassadors of

1282
01:31:10,484 --> 01:31:20,009
their virtues and what they represent, or they can
be horrible disgraces to their domains. And just

1283
01:31:20,009 --> 01:31:31,011
because some self-proclaimed person or deity
decides that they want control? Doesn't mean that

1284
01:31:31,011 --> 01:31:34,071
they have to have control over me.

1285
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:41,287
Now, this does not mean that I do not respect the
gods and the power that they wield, but, I mean,

1286
01:31:41,351 --> 01:31:50,641
for the love of Sarenrae, we have seen Pike do
many a powerful thing. So, therefore, I do not

1287
01:31:50,641 --> 01:31:57,566
respect the gods any more than I respect the
living people who are standing beside me at this

1288
01:31:57,566 --> 01:32:11,473
moment. So I've also been coming to terms with the
fact that it seems that, whether we like it or

1289
01:32:11,473 --> 01:32:19,153
not, we are going to have to employ their
services. Looks like we're going to have to be

1290
01:32:19,153 --> 01:32:24,041
working with them in some way or another, myself
included, if we are going to overcome this.

1291
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:36,752
So maybe you should start rethinking the way you
look at your relationship to the Raven Queen.

1292
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:49,601
Maybe this can be a fine partnership. A fine
endeavor to do with her, and then once we save the

1293
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:56,893
world and we retire and some other young prodigies
come forward to save the world again, then we can

1294
01:32:56,893 --> 01:33:04,144
thank her for her services and move on. I don't
think we'll always need her. I don't think you

1295
01:33:04,144 --> 01:33:17,255
will always need her. And, keep in mind, the one
true thing that gives these gods their power are

1296
01:33:17,255 --> 01:33:30,888
their worshipers. So I guess I'll let you choose
what you want to be. And I walk off to catch up

1297
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:32,276
with the ladies.

1298
01:33:32,276 --> 01:33:37,995
MATT: All right.

1299
01:33:37,995 --> 01:33:44,984
LAURA: Did you guys make out? Was it really fun?
Lots of making out there?

1300
01:33:44,984 --> 01:33:49,652
MARISHA: Vax. Vex. Vex.

1301
01:33:49,652 --> 01:33:55,782
LAURA: I understand you have him on your mind. You
can't get our names straight.

1302
01:33:55,782 --> 01:34:02,659
MARISHA: You know, I was talking to him, so-- Hey.
I love you a whole lot.

1303
01:34:02,659 --> 01:34:06,130
LAURA: Do you still think you're talking to my
brother?

1304
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:10,652
MARISHA: I know who I'm talking to.

1305
01:34:10,652 --> 01:34:13,374
LIAM: Really similar.

1306
01:34:13,374 --> 01:34:16,222
SAM: She's the ranger.

1307
01:34:16,222 --> 01:34:20,036
ASHLEY: Did you ask him if he's going to help us?

1308
01:34:20,036 --> 01:34:24,395
MARISHA: Who? Vax? Oh.

1309
01:34:24,395 --> 01:34:29,938
ASHLEY: Vax. Is he going to help dig the trench?

1310
01:34:29,938 --> 01:34:34,685
LAURA: I turn around and see him. Is he just
standing there?

1311
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:37,423
MATT: Just standing there lost in thought, yeah.

1312
01:34:37,423 --> 01:34:40,900
LAURA: Um, hey.

1313
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,740
LIAM: What?

1314
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,697
LAURA: Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming to
help us, or are you just standing in the middle--

1315
01:34:47,697 --> 01:34:51,696
LIAM: Yeah, we gotta kill a dragon tomorrow. We
gotta kill a dragon. What do you need?

1316
01:34:51,696 --> 01:34:56,491
LAURA: Do you want to help build, I don't know, a
trench? Set a trap?

1317
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:59,194
LIAM: I mean, I'm really weak, but I think I can
use a shovel.

1318
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:06,295
LAURA: What time is it? We haven't even started
digging the trench yet? What fucking time is it?

1319
01:35:06,295 --> 01:35:09,036
MARISHA: It'll take me like an hour. It's fine.
What time is it?

1320
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:16,122
MATT: For you guys, at this point, it'd probably
be mid-afternoon, late afternoon. Percy. I need

1321
01:35:16,122 --> 01:35:20,659
you to go ahead and make three tinkering checks
for me, if you don't mind.

1322
01:35:20,659 --> 01:35:22,032
SAM: Oh, shit.

1323
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:29,638
MATT: The first one is using your intelligence
modifier.

1324
01:35:29,638 --> 01:35:39,221
TALIESIN: That's intelligence modifier plus
proficiency bonus plus tinkering?

1325
01:35:39,221 --> 01:35:41,301
MATT: Well, proficiency bonus is what you get with
tinkering.

1326
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:46,454
TALIESIN: Yeah. 24.

1327
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:49,548
(cheering)

1328
01:35:49,548 --> 01:35:54,625
MATT: All right, so, initial designs and
describing with your lackeys, for lack of a better

1329
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:59,619
term, that are helping you develop these springs,
you manage to explain, lay out, and develop the

1330
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:04,380
proper materials, the process, and they seem to
acknowledge and understand what you're trying to

1331
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,954
do, and you guys begin the work. Second check is
going to be with your dexterity modifier.

1332
01:36:08,954 --> 01:36:10,758
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, baby.

1333
01:36:10,758 --> 01:36:13,822
SAM: No one can help him on these things?

1334
01:36:13,822 --> 01:36:15,463
LAURA: We're not there.

1335
01:36:15,463 --> 01:36:20,200
TALIESIN: 22.

1336
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,683
MATT: You spend the better part of the day helping
them take the metal, strengthen it, bind it,

1337
01:36:24,683 --> 01:36:31,525
pulling it into the springs that are required. You
complete one, you get partway through the second

1338
01:36:31,525 --> 01:36:33,520
one. Make a final check if you don't mind.

1339
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,990
TRAVIS: With dex?

1340
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,549
MATT: This is also with dex, yeah.

1341
01:36:36,549 --> 01:36:38,289
LAURA: Come on.

1342
01:36:38,289 --> 01:36:52,127
TALIESIN: That's 23.

1343
01:36:52,127 --> 01:36:53,869
MATT: 23?

1344
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:56,708
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's the dexterity, right?

1345
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:57,761
MATT: Yeah.

1346
01:36:57,761 --> 01:37:03,006
TALIESIN: So yeah, that's right, 23.

1347
01:37:03,006 --> 01:37:12,518
MATT: 23. As the evening comes into about ten or
11 o'clock at night, after hours of aching work,

1348
01:37:12,518 --> 01:37:20,256
sweat beads dripping down the foreheads of the
three of you, forcing the furnace to work

1349
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:28,146
overtime. The room's heat and darkness eventually
almost puts you to a point of exhaustion and

1350
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:35,666
passing out. However, you do manage to complete
the springs. They seem to be functional, the

1351
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:41,527
structure of your trap is set. We shall see on the
morrow if it is as functional as you hope it is.

1352
01:37:41,527 --> 01:37:49,420
You do take a point of exhaustion through the work
that will consist throughout the next day.

1353
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:54,099
TALIESIN: Okay. What does a point of exhaustion
do?

1354
01:37:54,099 --> 01:37:57,975
MATT: Disadvantage on ability checks. So,
essentially, any skill checks or ability checks

1355
01:37:57,975 --> 01:38:02,310
you make-- not attacks or saves, but ability
checks you make for the next 24 hours will be at

1356
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,797
disadvantage.

1357
01:38:03,797 --> 01:38:05,953
LAURA: Did he work all the way through the night?

1358
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:09,818
MATT: No, this is just the physical activity
involved in getting it done in that short period

1359
01:38:09,818 --> 01:38:11,148
of time.

1360
01:38:11,148 --> 01:38:15,714
TALIESIN: Just double-checking, because I have no
brain currently, dice roll, dex modifier,

1361
01:38:15,714 --> 01:38:16,957
proficiency bonus?

1362
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:18,499
MATT: What?

1363
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:23,750
TALIESIN: Just because I have no brain, dex
modifier, proficiency bonus, dice roll?

1364
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,016
MATT: Correct.

1365
01:38:25,016 --> 01:38:26,434
TALIESIN: Okay, good.

1366
01:38:26,434 --> 01:38:35,444
MATT: You're good, you got it. As you guys find
yourselves resting for tomorrow's trap incursion

1367
01:38:35,444 --> 01:38:42,989
and hopeful defeat of Umbrasyl, we will take a
break for the rest of you and come back here.

1368
01:38:42,989 --> 01:38:45,655
LAURA: Oh, god! There's more we have to do!

1369
01:38:45,655 --> 01:38:48,037
SAM: It's okay, we'll do it during the break.

1370
01:38:48,037 --> 01:38:51,957
MATT: We'll come back in. We need a pee break.
Quick one, guys.

1371
01:38:51,957 --> 01:50:25,367
[break]

1372
01:50:25,419 --> 01:50:30,501
MATT: And welcome back. So, as you're preparing
for this, what else do you guys need to do before

1373
01:50:30,501 --> 01:50:31,713
the morrow?

1374
01:50:31,713 --> 01:50:32,937
MARISHA: I dig a trench.

1375
01:50:32,937 --> 01:50:34,009
MATT: All right, so you dig the trench.

1376
01:50:34,009 --> 01:50:37,446
MARISHA: I want it to be far away to where there's
a tunnel and then make a circle around it.

1377
01:50:37,446 --> 01:50:41,310
LAURA: We need to get Fassbender into the middle
where the treasure's going to be.

1378
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:44,518
LIAM: I walk Fassbender out and I lay him down on
his back, face-up.

1379
01:50:44,518 --> 01:50:46,339
MARISHA: We have to do some stage-setting here. We
have to set the scene.

1380
01:50:46,339 --> 01:50:49,745
MATT: Okay, as a note, when you return to
Willhand's house, Fassbender and Willhand were

1381
01:50:49,745 --> 01:50:57,100
both ejected from the doorway. Fassbender doesn't
fit in that large room and wrecked part of the

1382
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:02,189
staircase from underneath but is fine. As soon as
you acknowledge Fassbender to start moving,

1383
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:08,468
Fassbender, who has been inert this entire time,
since left there for the evening before, takes a

1384
01:51:08,468 --> 01:51:16,082
step and the area where the crack that you sealed
earlier reopens. It looks like there is a minimal

1385
01:51:16,082 --> 01:51:20,463
magical effect that was more of a cosmetic effect
in the healing, but being a construct, it does not

1386
01:51:20,463 --> 01:51:22,142
actually heal damage from it.

1387
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:24,793
MARISHA: Okay. Can I go ahead and take this
time to do--

1388
01:51:24,793 --> 01:51:27,266
SAM: You're not there.

1389
01:51:27,266 --> 01:51:30,116
MARISHA: Oh, I'm not there yet? Oh no, I'm
building a tunnel. You're getting Fassbender.

1390
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:31,338
Never mind.

1391
01:51:31,338 --> 01:51:33,308
LIAM: Yeah, I'm walking Fassbender out to where
Keyleth is.

1392
01:51:33,308 --> 01:51:38,866
MATT: Okay. (stomping) Fassbender follows you out
to that area of the town. As night has come now,

1393
01:51:38,866 --> 01:51:43,910
the sun has gone, you guys are working in
darkness. What are you guys doing?

1394
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:48,675
ASHLEY: Vex, can I have one of your arrows? I want
to make it real special.

1395
01:51:48,675 --> 01:51:52,268
LAURA: You're speaking my language.

1396
01:51:52,268 --> 01:52:02,388
ASHLEY: Okay, so I grab one of her arrows and I
cast Glyph of Warding on one of her arrows.

1397
01:52:02,388 --> 01:52:05,954
LAURA: How many arrows can you do that do?

1398
01:52:05,954 --> 01:52:08,064
ASHLEY: I think just one.

1399
01:52:08,064 --> 01:52:11,556
SAM: Matt's checking his e-mail.

1400
01:52:11,556 --> 01:52:19,457
MATT: Within an object that can be closed, such as
a book, scroll, or treasure chest. So yeah, it

1401
01:52:19,457 --> 01:52:21,668
would have to be on something that, like a doorway
or--

1402
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:25,543
MARISHA: Like a treasure chest? If-- can you cast
it in like a barrel that he's going to break open?

1403
01:52:25,543 --> 01:52:27,242
ASHLEY: Okay.

1404
01:52:27,242 --> 01:52:32,707
LAURA: Thanks. I really enjoyed the idea of that.

1405
01:52:32,707 --> 01:52:34,879
ASHLEY: I thought it was going to work. It was
going to be real cool.

1406
01:52:34,879 --> 01:52:39,129
MATT: So, you decide what triggers the glyph when
you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed in a

1407
01:52:39,129 --> 01:52:42,308
surface, the most typical triggers include
touching or standing on the glyph, removing

1408
01:52:42,308 --> 01:52:46,601
another object covering the glyph, approaching
within a certain distance of the glyph, so you

1409
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:51,905
could place this in theory on the ground near
where the treasure's being left and give it the

1410
01:52:51,905 --> 01:52:53,479
specific trigger for it to go off.

1411
01:52:53,479 --> 01:53:00,509
LAURA: It can be maybe in a chest above
Fassbender, 'cause he's going to be buried, and

1412
01:53:00,509 --> 01:53:04,183
then it can be triggered maybe when the dragon
lifts it up.

1413
01:53:04,183 --> 01:53:07,360
MARISHA: What exactly does it do, the Glyph of
Warding?

1414
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,448
MATT: You can choose explosive runes--

1415
01:53:09,448 --> 01:53:10,968
ASHLEY: An explosive rune.

1416
01:53:10,968 --> 01:53:13,368
MARISHA: Oh, so it, (explosion). That's cool.

1417
01:53:13,368 --> 01:53:19,817
MATT: 5d8 acid damage, cold damage, fire, or
lightning or thunder damage. Your choice.

1418
01:53:19,817 --> 01:53:23,431
Everything within a 20-foot-sphere radius around
it.

1419
01:53:23,431 --> 01:53:30,571
LAURA: 20 feet is really big. Oh my god! You know
what you could do? You could make a trigger if he

1420
01:53:30,571 --> 01:53:36,026
gets a certain height off the ground, and that
way if he's over 20 feet above the ground, then it

1421
01:53:36,026 --> 01:53:38,605
triggers and he's the only thing that would get
affected.

1422
01:53:38,605 --> 01:53:41,819
MATT: Well, it triggers as a glyph, so whatever's
near the glyph would be affected.

1423
01:53:41,819 --> 01:53:49,063
ASHLEY: So can we hide it in the loot?

1424
01:53:49,063 --> 01:53:54,774
MATT: You can, you can definitely choose some sort
of a small chest or the ground underneath the loot

1425
01:53:54,774 --> 01:53:56,259
if you want to.

1426
01:53:56,259 --> 01:54:01,225
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll find something in the loot,
some little chest or something that I can put it in.

1427
01:54:01,225 --> 01:54:03,070
MATT: Okay, and what's your trigger?

1428
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:06,583
ASHLEY: When he gets-- if he starts to fly away.

1429
01:54:06,583 --> 01:54:10,523
MATT: Okay. So if a creature-- the trigger would
be, if a creature--

1430
01:54:10,523 --> 01:54:13,436
LIAM: Pulls the glyph up?

1431
01:54:13,436 --> 01:54:16,483
MATT: That's up to you. What would you like the
trigger to be?

1432
01:54:16,483 --> 01:54:18,321
SAM: Specific.

1433
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:23,686
ASHLEY: If he removes something on top of it. But
also if he grabbed it.

1434
01:54:23,686 --> 01:54:28,414
LAURA: What if it gets above a certain feet in the
air? Can it trigger then?

1435
01:54:28,414 --> 01:54:32,169
MATT: You can say if a creature flies above it at
a certain height it can trigger. I'll give you

1436
01:54:32,169 --> 01:54:33,504
that, yeah.

1437
01:54:33,504 --> 01:54:35,120
ASHLEY: Okay. So if it flies--

1438
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,102
MATT: If it flies 20 feet above it?

1439
01:54:37,102 --> 01:54:42,721
LAURA: I thought it meant if the glyph lifted in
the air.

1440
01:54:42,721 --> 01:54:48,355
MATT: We'll make that one of the triggers if you
want it to be lifted. So, if the glyph is lifted

1441
01:54:48,355 --> 01:54:50,181
by a creature--

1442
01:54:50,181 --> 01:54:51,711
ASHLEY: So it can't be if he just touches it?

1443
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:53,277
MATT: You could do that, yeah.

1444
01:54:53,277 --> 01:54:58,762
LAURA: But it might be better if he lands and then
we spring the trap. It could be a thing, if he

1445
01:54:58,762 --> 01:55:00,386
tries to leave it explodes.

1446
01:55:00,386 --> 01:55:01,664
ASHLEY: If he tries to leave.

1447
01:55:01,664 --> 01:55:05,974
MATT: Okay. So, if the object is lifted off the
ground, it triggers.

1448
01:55:05,974 --> 01:55:10,335
ASHLEY: Yeah. Even like this much? If it's just
moved.

1449
01:55:10,335 --> 01:55:13,972
MATT: Okay, and you're doing explosive rune. What
type of damage?

1450
01:55:13,972 --> 01:55:19,711
ASHLEY: I want to do cold damage.

1451
01:55:19,711 --> 01:55:23,007
LAURA: Would I know, is a black dragon-- does it
have any weaknesses?

1452
01:55:23,007 --> 01:55:29,940
MATT: You would know, with your knowledge and
specialization, it does not have any weaknesses.

1453
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,461
LAURA: It has no weaknesses.

1454
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:35,318
MATT: It is immune to acid damage, of course. But
that is the only real information you have.

1455
01:55:35,318 --> 01:55:37,552
TRAVIS: Make it acid damage.

1456
01:55:37,552 --> 01:55:39,541
(laughter)

1457
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:43,643
ASHLEY: I'm going to go cold damage.

1458
01:55:43,643 --> 01:55:44,902
MATT: Cold damage. All righty.

1459
01:55:44,902 --> 01:55:47,253
LAURA: What about Fassbender? Is he immune to any
damage?

1460
01:55:47,253 --> 01:55:49,757
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure he's immune to most kinds
of damage.

1461
01:55:49,757 --> 01:55:52,348
LIAM: No, it's hitting and slicing. I'll check.

1462
01:55:52,348 --> 01:55:54,190
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast it at fifth level.

1463
01:55:54,190 --> 01:56:05,780
MATT: Fifth level? All right. That brings it to
7d8 cold damage. And what's your spell DC?

1464
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:07,750
ASHLEY: 17.

1465
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,889
MARISHA: If we lose Fassbender--

1466
01:56:09,889 --> 01:56:13,460
LIAM: He's expendable. Hopefully he survives. If
not, good cause.

1467
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:19,184
LAURA: Can we fuse some chains into Fassbender so
that he can be attached to the ground?

1468
01:56:19,184 --> 01:56:22,496
MARISHA: I can. Can I do that? Right now?

1469
01:56:22,496 --> 01:56:23,958
MATT: Using what?

1470
01:56:23,958 --> 01:56:31,566
MARISHA: I want to take and cast a Stone Shape
spell, and then I want to open and almost make him

1471
01:56:31,566 --> 01:56:43,273
a chain harness that's embedded into his waist?
And then while I'm at it, can I patch him up?

1472
01:56:43,273 --> 01:56:55,380
MATT: Stone Shape is instantaneous. So whatever
you want to do, it happens immediately. So,

1473
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:03,090
essentially, you could, with one casting of Stone
Shape, seal the wound. With another casting of it

1474
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,761
you could then go ahead and have the chains--

1475
01:57:06,761 --> 01:57:08,826
LAURA: Ready to go (squishing).

1476
01:57:08,826 --> 01:57:12,876
MATT: Yeah, just embed them in and have it seal.
How many chains are you embedding in it?

1477
01:57:12,876 --> 01:57:14,575
LAURA: Two big ones?

1478
01:57:14,575 --> 01:57:18,447
MATT: Two big chains? Okay. So you get two of the
heaviest chains that you can find, which you

1479
01:57:18,447 --> 01:57:19,843
probably got from the prison.

1480
01:57:19,843 --> 01:57:22,782
MARISHA: All right, well, how about this? Vax,
Vex, grab a chain.

1481
01:57:22,782 --> 01:57:25,178
LAURA: All right. These are heavy.

1482
01:57:25,178 --> 01:57:27,231
MARISHA: Okay, ready? On my go.

1483
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:28,936
LAURA: Wait, where are we putting it?

1484
01:57:28,936 --> 01:57:35,075
MARISHA: I'm going to shove them in his abdomen.
Okay? I'm going to make a spot and just--

1485
01:57:35,075 --> 01:57:36,866
LAURA: You take left. I'll take right.

1486
01:57:36,866 --> 01:57:38,028
LIAM: Okay.

1487
01:57:38,028 --> 01:57:39,000
MARISHA: Ready?

1488
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,189
LIAM: Yeah.

1489
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:44,662
MATT: Okay. As she does that, suddenly the chest
wound opens up into these two big cavities. You

1490
01:57:44,662 --> 01:57:50,161
take the chain edges and put them inside as they
seal around them. There's now these two giant,

1491
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:57,514
heavy, door-holding chains that are now dangling
for about 70 feet on each end from his abdomen.

1492
01:57:57,514 --> 01:58:00,137
LAURA: Where do we attach these chains to? The
ground?

1493
01:58:00,137 --> 01:58:06,143
LIAM: One to the ground. Put the other one in a
goliath's hands with a harpoon or a hook on the

1494
01:58:06,143 --> 01:58:12,997
other end. Snag our prey, and then we have a
Fassbender hanging from the bottom of a dragon.

1495
01:58:12,997 --> 01:58:14,395
MARISHA: Okay.

1496
01:58:14,395 --> 01:58:19,285
MATT: You can find some metallic hooks just
through general construction materials in the town

1497
01:58:19,285 --> 01:58:20,991
if you want to.

1498
01:58:20,991 --> 01:58:26,917
LIAM: I think we should do ten or 15 feet to the
ground of chain and ten or 15 feet to the dragon,

1499
01:58:26,917 --> 01:58:30,019
so that it's, thunk, and he's caught on the
ground.

1500
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:31,353
LAURA: Just ten.

1501
01:58:31,353 --> 01:58:32,572
LIAM: Yeah?

1502
01:58:32,572 --> 01:58:33,982
MARISHA: Okay.

1503
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:40,936
LIAM: Yeah, we'll sever the chains with Grog's
muscles. We need to get 'em the right distance.

1504
01:58:40,936 --> 01:58:42,493
MATT: About how long?

1505
01:58:42,493 --> 01:58:44,890
LIAM: Ten feet into the ground, which we can--

1506
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:48,940
MARISHA: Do it right now. Ready? I'm going to do
another Stone Shape spell into the ground.

1507
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:52,143
MATT: You have to go around and find an area,
because a lot of it's dirt. You have to find an

1508
01:58:52,143 --> 01:58:58,881
area that has actual stonework in the ground.
Otherwise, it's just earth that's pulling it. Go

1509
01:58:58,881 --> 01:59:00,998
ahead and roll a survival check.

1510
01:59:00,998 --> 01:59:07,274
MARISHA: Not bad. What's my survival? 24.

1511
01:59:07,274 --> 01:59:15,708
MATT: 24, okay. You take some time. It's about 60
feet out from where the drop point is, is the

1512
01:59:15,708 --> 01:59:23,339
nearest piece of near-surface stone. It's about 15
feet beneath the surface, but it is viable.

1513
01:59:23,339 --> 01:59:26,172
MARISHA: Negative. I will cast--

1514
01:59:26,172 --> 01:59:28,304
LAURA: Why can't it be 15 feet below the surface?

1515
01:59:28,304 --> 01:59:32,062
LIAM: But he's going to go up like a kite now
because it's going 60 feet all the way over there,

1516
01:59:32,062 --> 01:59:33,895
where stone is.

1517
01:59:33,895 --> 01:59:39,372
MARISHA: I'm going to burn-- I did that earlier,
but I'm going to burn my last 5th-level spell to

1518
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:42,372
do Transmute Rock again?

1519
01:59:42,372 --> 01:59:43,789
MATT: Okay.

1520
01:59:43,789 --> 01:59:49,500
MARISHA: So you said there was dirt? All right,
let's dig a little bit of a hole real quick. So

1521
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:52,845
we dig a hole ten feet down.

1522
01:59:52,845 --> 01:59:54,135
MATT: Okay.

1523
01:59:54,135 --> 01:59:57,889
MARISHA: Put the chain in there. Cover it back up.
Transmute. Turn it into rock.

1524
01:59:57,889 --> 02:00:03,012
MATT: Okay, and with that, the earth-- Okay, what
is the radius of that one there? Let me see.

1525
02:00:03,012 --> 02:00:04,754
SAM: We have to cover this up.

1526
02:00:04,754 --> 02:00:06,163
LIAM: With dirt?

1527
02:00:06,163 --> 02:00:07,490
MARISHA: And treasure.

1528
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:17,909
MATT: Transmute Rock-- 40-foot cube. You turn that
into a solid fucking subterranean block of stone.

1529
02:00:17,909 --> 02:00:28,344
All righty. Now you have Fassbender just there,
stuck to the ground with the chain at its side.

1530
02:00:28,344 --> 02:00:31,080
LIAM: Fassbender, lie down. Lie down?

1531
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:40,618
MARISHA: Can I take my last little bit of Stone
Shape residual energy and take that mustache Vax

1532
02:00:40,618 --> 02:00:41,606
drew on--

1533
02:00:41,606 --> 02:00:43,179
MATT: Stone Shape does not--

1534
02:00:43,179 --> 02:00:49,129
MARISHA: And make the mustache permanent that he
drew on with charcoal?

1535
02:00:49,129 --> 02:00:55,655
MATT: Sure, I'll let that slide. With the remnants
of the spell magic fading, the now-lying-down

1536
02:00:55,655 --> 02:01:01,593
Fassbender staring up with his vacant sunken
blue-glowing eyes towards the night sky and the

1537
02:01:01,593 --> 02:01:05,013
stars above, your hand reaches across the face,
and with that suddenly the--

1538
02:01:05,013 --> 02:01:07,502
MARISHA: I like this, I want to keep it, there we
go.

1539
02:01:07,502 --> 02:01:14,304
MATT: --the once-charcoaled curly mustache recedes
into the face, carved permanently to his face.

1540
02:01:14,304 --> 02:01:17,476
MARISHA: You look much better now, Fassbender.
High-five.

1541
02:01:17,476 --> 02:01:21,816
LIAM: Give Keyleth a very soft high-five, please.

1542
02:01:21,816 --> 02:01:25,060
MARISHA: Yeah! Isn't that cool?

1543
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:26,830
MATT: That'll probably bruise tomorrow.

1544
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:28,969
MARISHA: It's okay. It's cool.

1545
02:01:28,969 --> 02:01:37,458
LIAM: I quickly take that same charcoal out and I
write in Common on his chest: Conclave or bust.

1546
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:40,724
(laughter)

1547
02:01:40,724 --> 02:01:48,259
SAM: I'm going to go to Keyleth and ask if I can
borrow the rod of immovable rodness. How big is it?

1548
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:51,357
MATT: It's like that long. It's like the rung of a
ladder.

1549
02:01:51,357 --> 02:01:52,907
SAM: Got it.

1550
02:01:52,907 --> 02:01:54,593
MATT: It's got a little button on the side.

1551
02:01:54,593 --> 02:01:56,226
SAM: Button on the side? Cool.

1552
02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:58,079
TALIESIN: Like a Tron lightbike.

1553
02:01:58,079 --> 02:01:59,736
SAM: I love it.

1554
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:04,088
LAURA: When are we going to set the trap that
Percy made?

1555
02:02:04,088 --> 02:02:05,815
LIAM: As soon as he finishes it.

1556
02:02:05,815 --> 02:02:07,415
MARISHA: Yeah, we should set the stage.

1557
02:02:07,415 --> 02:02:12,530
TALIESIN: In theory, it has to be laid down
underneath all the treasure so that it just is

1558
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:18,674
nothing, and then we put everything on top, and
then basically it's set, and then pins get pulled

1559
02:02:18,674 --> 02:02:22,290
so that it's set. And you don't disturb shit
again.

1560
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:26,142
MARISHA: Hey Percy, we're ready to fly in the trap
whenever you are.

1561
02:02:26,142 --> 02:02:33,943
TALIESIN: Yes, let's do that, gentlemen. Let's
move it. Good work, ladies and gentlemen.

1562
02:02:33,943 --> 02:02:44,235
MARISHA: While you guys set the trap, I'm going to
turn into a raven. My job is done here. I'm going

1563
02:02:44,235 --> 02:02:51,077
to just go and circle while they're setting the
trap and setting the stage and do patrol and make

1564
02:02:51,077 --> 02:02:52,874
sure we're not being watched.

1565
02:02:52,874 --> 02:02:54,314
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1566
02:02:54,314 --> 02:02:56,233
LAURA: Why this creepy music?

1567
02:02:56,233 --> 02:02:57,920
SAM: It's random, guys.

1568
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,892
ASHLEY: Why is he doing his eyebrows up and down?

1569
02:03:01,892 --> 02:03:04,832
LAURA: Because the fucking dragon's going to see
us right now.

1570
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,217
MARISHA: 16.

1571
02:03:06,217 --> 02:03:07,161
MATT: 16?

1572
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:08,935
MARISHA: No, sorry. 15.

1573
02:03:08,935 --> 02:03:13,539
MATT: 15. You circle for a while and keep watch.
So far, nothing seems to have caught your

1574
02:03:13,539 --> 02:03:21,745
attention that's out of the ordinary. About half
an hour passes before you see a group of

1575
02:03:21,745 --> 02:03:29,620
civilians, along with Percy, wheeling on carts
this large ramshackle construction made of

1576
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:38,068
support beams from houses, metal joints that were
used as basic construction elements, as well as

1577
02:03:38,068 --> 02:03:46,304
these large metallic springs on multiple sides
with hooks and elements of a chain-based net that

1578
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:52,485
has been piecemealed together. Eventually you guys
bring it over. You clear out the area.

1579
02:03:52,485 --> 02:03:55,823
LAURA: Fassbender will lay on top of the trap.

1580
02:03:55,823 --> 02:03:57,615
MATT: Fassbender will lay on top of the trap?

1581
02:03:57,615 --> 02:03:59,371
LAURA: Right? He can't lay under the trap.

1582
02:03:59,371 --> 02:04:05,124
SAM: Well if it's like a mousetrap, can't he lie
in between it? Taliesin, how does it work?

1583
02:04:05,124 --> 02:04:08,100
MARISHA: Let's just keep him right off to the side
because if that trap triggers--

1584
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:12,448
TALIESIN: In theory, he should be able to fit
right at the sides of it, because it's got an

1585
02:04:12,448 --> 02:04:17,494
armature spring system. As long as you're not in
the way of the armatures, you should be fine.

1586
02:04:17,494 --> 02:04:25,453
MATT: So you set it up and away, laying the sides
down, precariously putting the pins in, holding it

1587
02:04:25,453 --> 02:04:32,056
in an open position. You begin to take dirt, dust,
and gathering up the area, trying to hide it to

1588
02:04:32,056 --> 02:04:36,194
the best of your ability. Who is in charge of
camouflaging this piece?

1589
02:04:36,194 --> 02:04:39,871
MARISHA: Go ranger, go ranger, go!

1590
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:42,450
MATT: Make a survival check.

1591
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:46,917
TRAVIS: "Which dice will I use? There's no way to
choose."

1592
02:04:46,917 --> 02:04:54,397
SAM: Can I aid her in this bit of camouflage?

1593
02:04:54,397 --> 02:04:55,812
LAURA: You want to sing me some inspiration?

1594
02:04:55,812 --> 02:04:56,904
SAM: Can I inspire her?

1595
02:04:56,904 --> 02:04:58,223
MATT: Sure, what do you want to sing?

1596
02:04:58,223 --> 02:05:06,253
SAM: (singing) R-r-ranger, turn and face the
strange! R-r-ranger, looks like you're going to

1597
02:05:06,253 --> 02:05:14,051
have to hide this shit! Time may save me, but I
hope you-- also do--

1598
02:05:14,051 --> 02:05:16,217
(laughter)

1599
02:05:16,217 --> 02:05:17,251
LAURA: 31.

1600
02:05:17,251 --> 02:05:24,196
MATT: 31. You guys take a good portion of the next
hour or so, under her guidance and tutelage,

1601
02:05:24,196 --> 02:05:31,849
hiding this entire trap, getting dirt, the top
layer of sand to cover it so it looks like it

1602
02:05:31,849 --> 02:05:33,511
hasn't been recently disturbed--

1603
02:05:33,511 --> 02:05:35,522
LAURA: Little Dust of Tracelessness.

1604
02:05:35,522 --> 02:05:41,705
MATT: Little Dust of Tracelessness to fill in and
smooth out any of the ripples of any possible

1605
02:05:41,705 --> 02:05:45,557
passage that has come through. Fassbender has
been--

1606
02:05:45,557 --> 02:05:47,165
(crash)

1607
02:05:47,165 --> 02:05:55,382
MATT: Killed. Buried beneath the surface, just to
the point where he's pretty much flush with the

1608
02:05:55,382 --> 02:06:03,110
ground of where it is. Contraption set, the
objects placed back inside with some of the

1609
02:06:03,110 --> 02:06:08,299
barrels and some of the leftover pieces of wood,
the one overturned cart. You go ahead and take the

1610
02:06:08,299 --> 02:06:17,881
chest and you place the glyph onto it. It takes a
while to cast that spell, about an hour, but you

1611
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:19,868
complete it without an issue.

1612
02:06:19,868 --> 02:06:26,056
LAURA: Make it look like there's treasure on it. I
take some of the gold that we have and--

1613
02:06:26,056 --> 02:06:27,751
MATT: Place it onto it?

1614
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:32,348
LAURA: A thin layer, where it looks like a lot of
gold but it's really just a thin layer of gold

1615
02:06:32,348 --> 02:06:35,188
over top of rocks.

1616
02:06:35,188 --> 02:06:41,742
ASHLEY: If it's a chest, can we put some coins
sticking out of it? So it looks like it's full?

1617
02:06:41,742 --> 02:06:46,028
MATT: You can do that. It does cost you about 200
gold worth of components to do this glyph, so mark

1618
02:06:46,028 --> 02:06:48,298
off that from your personal gold supply.

1619
02:06:48,298 --> 02:06:49,612
LAURA: Grog.

1620
02:06:49,612 --> 02:06:50,985
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1621
02:06:50,985 --> 02:06:58,631
LAURA: Question. We sort of thought maybe we could
use Kevdak as a tribute, like we sacrificed him to

1622
02:06:58,631 --> 02:07:01,780
the great shitty Umbrasyl. Is that his name?

1623
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,423
MATT: Umbrasyl, yes.

1624
02:07:03,423 --> 02:07:11,244
LAURA: But it doesn't quite have the same effect
without his head. Do you still have that head? In

1625
02:07:11,244 --> 02:07:14,665
fact, I think I might have the head. Did I put it
in my bag of cold?

1626
02:07:14,665 --> 02:07:19,320
MATT: You did, I believe. You gave it to her to
put in there?

1627
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:21,686
LAURA: Would that be all right with you, Grog?

1628
02:07:21,686 --> 02:07:22,940
TRAVIS: No.

1629
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:25,729
LAURA: Don't you want to kill this dragon, Grog?

1630
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:26,952
TRAVIS: I want that head.

1631
02:07:26,952 --> 02:07:29,572
LAURA: I don't have the head. I only have the
gross bear tattoo off Kevdak.

1632
02:07:29,572 --> 02:07:32,653
TRAVIS: That's right, I put the flayed skin. I
don't have the head.

1633
02:07:32,653 --> 02:07:34,926
LAURA: Grog, I can tell when you're lying.

1634
02:07:34,926 --> 02:07:37,521
TRAVIS: I don't have the head.

1635
02:07:37,521 --> 02:07:45,344
LAURA: You're lying. Grog, can we maybe-- you'll
be able to get it back, because we're going to

1636
02:07:45,344 --> 02:07:49,965
kill this dragon and then you can just go and pick
up the head and keep it again in your Bag of Holding.

1637
02:07:49,965 --> 02:07:51,444
TRAVIS: What's the head for?

1638
02:07:51,444 --> 02:07:55,963
LAURA: So we can make it seem like we sacrificed
Kevdak to the dragon.

1639
02:07:55,963 --> 02:07:57,650
TRAVIS: What if you sacrifice me?

1640
02:07:57,650 --> 02:07:58,914
LAURA: Well, what?

1641
02:07:58,914 --> 02:08:00,638
TRAVIS: Yeah, use me as bait!

1642
02:08:00,638 --> 02:08:04,560
SAM: We'd have to chop off your head.

1643
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,541
MARISHA: No, we could just tie him to a chair or
something.

1644
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:10,948
TRAVIS: Or I could just put my hands behind my
back.

1645
02:08:10,948 --> 02:08:15,692
MARISHA: Make it look-- wrap some rope to make it
look like it's loosely tied.

1646
02:08:15,692 --> 02:08:17,270
SAM: What if he bites and kills you?

1647
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:22,443
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, but it's better live
bait than dead, right? At least when you fish.

1648
02:08:22,443 --> 02:08:23,549
SAM: Nope.

1649
02:08:23,549 --> 02:08:25,599
TRAVIS: Pretty sure that's true.

1650
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:26,911
SAM: Nope.

1651
02:08:26,911 --> 02:08:29,427
LAURA: Do you want to be bait, Grog?

1652
02:08:29,427 --> 02:08:30,649
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1653
02:08:30,649 --> 02:08:32,944
MARISHA: Does that sound fun to you, or--

1654
02:08:32,944 --> 02:08:37,771
LAURA: There's exploding things around here. Are
you sure you want to be in this area?

1655
02:08:37,771 --> 02:08:42,227
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1656
02:08:42,227 --> 02:08:47,445
ASHLEY: No, you don't.

1657
02:08:47,445 --> 02:08:51,376
TRAVIS: (laughs) No, I don't. I will give you the
head of Kevdak.

1658
02:08:51,376 --> 02:08:54,293
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, it took a look from Pike!

1659
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:56,603
SAM: Wow, that's a powerful look.

1660
02:08:56,603 --> 02:08:58,462
TRAVIS: I want it back.

1661
02:08:58,462 --> 02:09:00,196
ASHLEY: You'll get it back.

1662
02:09:00,196 --> 02:09:02,165
TRAVIS: You better promise.

1663
02:09:02,165 --> 02:09:03,426
LAURA: I promise.

1664
02:09:03,426 --> 02:09:05,002
TRAVIS: All right. You can have it.

1665
02:09:05,002 --> 02:09:06,741
ASHLEY: With a bow on it. You'll get it back.

1666
02:09:06,741 --> 02:09:08,870
TRAVIS: I don't want a bow on it! He didn't ever
wear a bow!

1667
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:11,748
ASHLEY: No, I'm just saying you'll get it back.

1668
02:09:11,748 --> 02:09:15,244
TRAVIS: I take the skull and roll it to her feet.
It's still got flesh on it, right?

1669
02:09:15,244 --> 02:09:21,897
MATT: Yeah, it's a little soft, but it works. So
you have the head of Kevdak at your disposal. Trap

1670
02:09:21,897 --> 02:09:25,767
is set. Percy, who's pulling the pins, what's the
trigger mechanism?

1671
02:09:25,767 --> 02:09:33,198
TALIESIN: The trigger mechanism is any weight
shift. It's the same as a mousetrap. It's like you

1672
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:38,003
put pressure on it, you take pressure off of it,
doesn't matter. As long as there's immediate

1673
02:09:38,003 --> 02:09:46,333
weight shift in the platform, where the booty is,
it just goes snap.

1674
02:09:46,333 --> 02:09:53,174
MATT: Okay. So very carefully and very
precariously, you all have set this trap as the

1675
02:09:53,174 --> 02:09:58,096
final element, aside from the camouflage. Is there
anything else you would like to add with this very

1676
02:09:58,096 --> 02:10:03,618
sensitive large situation being finished?

1677
02:10:03,618 --> 02:10:06,846
SAM: Where are we hiding?

1678
02:10:06,846 --> 02:10:10,966
LAURA: We're going to hide in the trenches, yes?

1679
02:10:10,966 --> 02:10:14,197
MARISHA: It depends on where you want to hide, I
guess. (caws)

1680
02:10:14,197 --> 02:10:22,333
TALIESIN: As long as I'm within range for my guns,
I'm going to hide way off in the treeline.

1681
02:10:22,333 --> 02:10:27,774
MARISHA: Yeah, there were two trees that were 80
feet? Or 60?

1682
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:33,585
MATT: Which, Ryan, can I get the box of tree
materials? Thank you.

1683
02:10:33,585 --> 02:10:35,953
SAM: You know, that box of trees that you have.

1684
02:10:35,953 --> 02:10:38,532
ASHLEY: Are we near any structures or any houses?

1685
02:10:38,532 --> 02:10:43,865
MATT: No, this is outside of town. It's an open
field other than a handful of trees. Just to give

1686
02:10:43,865 --> 02:10:48,845
you guys perspective right here, this is the setup
right now. This is the central area where most

1687
02:10:48,845 --> 02:10:53,037
things have been dropped. There are pieces here.
If you want to put it into perspective here, the

1688
02:10:53,037 --> 02:10:58,721
glyph lies over in this area. Most of the
treasure's been placed in that area. The trap

1689
02:10:58,721 --> 02:11:10,879
we'll say is set about in that area, with the
central piece being the triggering mechanism.

1690
02:11:10,879 --> 02:11:13,526
LAURA: And the trench is all around that?

1691
02:11:13,526 --> 02:11:17,865
MATT: The trenches are down in this area. Oh, now
you say the trenches, are you saying they're

1692
02:11:17,865 --> 02:11:19,374
covered or not?

1693
02:11:19,374 --> 02:11:20,680
LAURA: They are covered.

1694
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:25,798
MATT: So they're tunnels. They're not trenches.
Where is the opening for the tunnel? Where would

1695
02:11:25,798 --> 02:11:27,145
you like it to be?

1696
02:11:27,145 --> 02:11:31,313
MARISHA: Far away.

1697
02:11:31,313 --> 02:11:32,725
LAURA: There, on the other side?

1698
02:11:32,725 --> 02:11:33,832
MATT: This side over here?

1699
02:11:33,832 --> 02:11:35,808
TRAVIS: Make it 50 feet at the most.

1700
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:39,150
MARISHA: I want it to be more than that, I'd like
it to be 100 feet away.

1701
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:40,999
TRAVIS: You want them to get there in one turn,
right?

1702
02:11:40,999 --> 02:11:44,575
LAURA: You want to be able to get there right away
on surprise attack, spring right out of the

1703
02:11:44,575 --> 02:11:47,029
ground as soon as that trap triggers.

1704
02:11:47,029 --> 02:11:48,274
MARISHA: No.

1705
02:11:48,274 --> 02:11:52,908
TALIESIN: In theory, if the trap is sprung it'll
make enough ruckus that anyone in those trenches

1706
02:11:52,908 --> 02:11:54,169
should hear it.

1707
02:11:54,169 --> 02:11:56,289
MATT: Right, but it's more about the proximity of
the exit to the trenches.

1708
02:11:56,289 --> 02:12:04,126
MARISHA: Yeah, what I'm thinking is I've got a
circle that I've carved around it. And then

1709
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:11,285
there's like a tunnel that shoots off this way and
there's an entrance that they can walk in and get

1710
02:12:11,285 --> 02:12:12,788
into their places.

1711
02:12:12,788 --> 02:12:15,514
MATT: You want them to just burst out, then?

1712
02:12:15,514 --> 02:12:21,833
MARISHA: I've made it really thin like I did
before, carved it nice and thin--

1713
02:12:21,833 --> 02:12:27,716
MATT: Okay. So the entrance is back here, then.

1714
02:12:27,716 --> 02:12:29,869
MARISHA: I don't know what that means.

1715
02:12:29,869 --> 02:12:32,010
TRAVIS: I thought we were all filing out of one
hole.

1716
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:34,899
MATT: That's what I was getting at beforehand. The
intent is for them to push up and out?

1717
02:12:34,899 --> 02:12:37,637
MARISHA: Unless you guys think it would be
better?

1718
02:12:37,637 --> 02:12:39,575
LAURA: No, I feel like they've gotta burst out, yeah.

1719
02:12:39,575 --> 02:12:43,640
TRAVIS: I was confused.

1720
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:49,366
MARISHA: It's going to be cool, like night of the
living dead-style! Orcs coming out of the ground!

1721
02:12:49,366 --> 02:12:52,183
In my mind, it's really awesome.

1722
02:12:52,183 --> 02:12:55,009
SAM: In your mind, so many things--

1723
02:12:55,009 --> 02:12:56,488
MARISHA: So many things.

1724
02:12:56,488 --> 02:13:08,101
MATT: There we go. All right. We have entrenched
areas in this vicinity with you around it. What's

1725
02:13:08,101 --> 02:13:10,944
the last things you need to prepare before the
evening is done?

1726
02:13:10,944 --> 02:13:12,403
LAURA: We need to have a feast.

1727
02:13:12,403 --> 02:13:13,519
SAM: Heroes' Feast.

1728
02:13:13,519 --> 02:13:17,413
LIAM: I have a couple of questions. One, so I
asked this outside but I just want to make sure.

1729
02:13:17,413 --> 02:13:22,200
It says in the rogue section that longsword is
something that I'm proficient in, but there's a

1730
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:30,660
rule somewhere that I can't find that says I can't
use that for sneak attack? On page 95, it says I'm

1731
02:13:30,660 --> 02:13:32,729
proficient in longswords.

1732
02:13:32,729 --> 02:13:33,764
MATT: Correct.

1733
02:13:33,764 --> 02:13:38,590
LIAM: But somewhere else that I'm unaware of-- no
surprise, motherfucker?

1734
02:13:38,590 --> 02:13:47,286
MATT: The attack must use a finesse or ranged
weapon.

1735
02:13:47,286 --> 02:13:49,138
LIAM: So it's not a finesse weapon.

1736
02:13:49,138 --> 02:13:50,964
MATT: A longsword, I believe, is strength.

1737
02:13:50,964 --> 02:13:55,812
TALIESIN: No, wait! This longsword was being used
as a finesse weapon.

1738
02:13:55,812 --> 02:13:57,904
MARISHA: It has been used?

1739
02:13:57,904 --> 02:14:02,293
TALIESIN: We had this discussion at one point. We
decided that this longsword was a finesse weapon.

1740
02:14:02,293 --> 02:14:06,340
Or it could be used as a finesse weapon.

1741
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:08,504
SAM: Aloha.

1742
02:14:08,504 --> 02:14:14,354
TALIESIN: Aloha!

1743
02:14:14,354 --> 02:14:18,401
LIAM: In Hawaii, the longsword is a finesse
weapon.

1744
02:14:18,401 --> 02:14:23,546
TALIESIN: There's a beautiful view out this
window.

1745
02:14:23,546 --> 02:14:25,706
LIAM: Just want to know in advance.

1746
02:14:25,706 --> 02:14:38,052
MATT: I would say-- stretching it thin. We had
agreed it was a finesse weapon for use, meaning as

1747
02:14:38,052 --> 02:14:44,268
a dex-based modifier for you to use in combat
specifically. When did this discussion happen, I'm

1748
02:14:44,268 --> 02:14:45,817
trying to recall?

1749
02:14:45,817 --> 02:14:52,705
TALIESIN: This happened when we were doing sword
tricks. We were discussing whether or not I could

1750
02:14:52,705 --> 02:15:05,237
actually use a sword. And what that would be like.
Because we were having the conversation about

1751
02:15:05,237 --> 02:15:09,208
whether you should take strength with the sword.
I've obviously been using it as a dex-based sword,

1752
02:15:09,208 --> 02:15:15,920
but-- I don't remember if that was specifically
for me, or--

1753
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:21,745
SAM: This is a tough decision. But you know, it's
not a tough decision to subscribe to Loot Crate.

1754
02:15:21,745 --> 02:15:28,651
MATT: I would say because it is part of the intent
of the weapon that the longsword, while it may be

1755
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:36,754
circumstantially used as a dex-based weapon for
that purpose, it is out of your realm of expertise

1756
02:15:36,754 --> 02:15:40,618
when it comes to using the sneak attack ability.
It would not be able to sneak attack.

1757
02:15:40,618 --> 02:15:48,436
LIAM: Lovely. I'm going to take off my Boots of
Haste and my cloak. See if anyone else wants it,

1758
02:15:48,436 --> 02:15:54,917
and I'm going to start attuning-- Can you use
this?

1759
02:15:54,917 --> 02:15:56,046
LAURA: What is it?

1760
02:15:56,046 --> 02:15:58,408
LIAM: Circlet. Would you be able to control
Fassbender?

1761
02:15:58,408 --> 02:16:01,446
LAURA: Instead of shooting arrows?

1762
02:16:01,446 --> 02:16:08,029
LIAM: No, Keyleth said you just say "zap," and he
just does it until you tell him to stop.

1763
02:16:08,029 --> 02:16:11,796
MARISHA: Yeah, it takes your concentration, so it
takes--

1764
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:13,533
MATT: Well, it takes an action to--

1765
02:16:13,533 --> 02:16:16,416
MARISHA: I'm trying to speak in character, all
right?

1766
02:16:16,416 --> 02:16:23,529
TALIESIN: What do your Boots of Haste do and what
does your cloak do, out of curiosity?

1767
02:16:23,529 --> 02:16:28,847
LIAM: I want to see how much I'm giving up here.
Haste will let you double your speed, you'll be

1768
02:16:28,847 --> 02:16:36,391
able to do one more thing when you're doing
things. Scanlan showed me some sort of potion.

1769
02:16:36,391 --> 02:16:39,682
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm assuming that was a Potion of
Haste.

1770
02:16:39,682 --> 02:16:45,932
SAM: I gave the Potion of Haste to Grog. We both
found these two potions. Grog has the Potion of

1771
02:16:45,932 --> 02:16:50,630
Haste if anyone else desperately needs it, and I
certainly don't need to be any smaller, so I've

1772
02:16:50,630 --> 02:16:54,000
given the potion of reduction? Reducement?

1773
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,905
MATT: Diminution.

1774
02:16:55,905 --> 02:16:59,148
SAM: Diminution? To good old Vax here.

1775
02:16:59,148 --> 02:17:03,372
LIAM: It's funny, because part of my idea was to
go in with you. But I know that you have to do it

1776
02:17:03,372 --> 02:17:09,372
to folk of your own size, but if I were little
Vax, I could go with you.

1777
02:17:09,372 --> 02:17:12,137
LAURA: Why can't you keep your boots on for that?

1778
02:17:12,137 --> 02:17:16,831
MARISHA: Honestly, spellcasters, it's not as
beneficial for us to have Haste.

1779
02:17:16,831 --> 02:17:23,372
LIAM: That's true, but I'm wondering if anyone
wants Fassbender. If I'm going in, I'm not going

1780
02:17:23,372 --> 02:17:25,702
to be able to concentrate on that.

1781
02:17:25,702 --> 02:17:27,459
MARISHA: Well, depends on when you're going in.

1782
02:17:27,459 --> 02:17:31,073
SAM: You don't know. Give it to Vex.

1783
02:17:31,073 --> 02:17:37,767
MARISHA: If you focus on Fassbender and tell him
to just attack or to cast Slow, he will do that

1784
02:17:37,767 --> 02:17:41,880
until that dragon is dead. He will just continue
without you having to focus on him.

1785
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:48,753
LIAM: I know. I just don't want to miss a shot to
go into the belly of the beast with my little

1786
02:17:48,753 --> 02:17:50,118
buddy here.

1787
02:17:50,118 --> 02:17:51,588
MARISHA: That's so trite.

1788
02:17:51,588 --> 02:17:53,442
SAM: We were born to do this!

1789
02:17:53,442 --> 02:17:55,360
LAURA: Does it have to be attuned?

1790
02:17:55,360 --> 02:18:00,534
MATT: Yes. So if you already have three objects
attuned, you'd have to take one off.

1791
02:18:00,534 --> 02:18:02,198
LAURA: No, I can't wear the circlet, dude.

1792
02:18:02,198 --> 02:18:03,515
LIAM: All right, I'll wear it.

1793
02:18:03,515 --> 02:18:08,056
TALIESIN: I could, definitely. If you could take
the Haste Potion then I might take the boots,

1794
02:18:08,056 --> 02:18:11,824
because speed would not be a terrible thing for me
to have because then I get to shoot more.

1795
02:18:11,824 --> 02:18:21,774
LIAM: I'm going to take this sword and I'm going
to leave the Deathwalker's Ward on, that can't

1796
02:18:21,774 --> 02:18:29,060
come off anymore, and the circlet, so the boots
are up for borrowing and the Displacer Cloak is up

1797
02:18:29,060 --> 02:18:32,169
for borrowing. Displacer Cloak makes you very hard
to hit.

1798
02:18:32,169 --> 02:18:33,917
LAURA: That's good.

1799
02:18:33,917 --> 02:18:36,786
LIAM: And the haste will Haste you.

1800
02:18:36,786 --> 02:18:40,459
TALIESIN: What does the cloak do, again?

1801
02:18:40,459 --> 02:18:47,422
MATT: Disadvantage on physical attacks against
you. Until you get hit, and then once you get hit,

1802
02:18:47,422 --> 02:18:49,395
it fails to work for a turn.

1803
02:18:49,395 --> 02:18:54,395
TRAVIS: I might take that.

1804
02:18:54,395 --> 02:18:56,417
MARISHA: The cloak?

1805
02:18:56,417 --> 02:19:01,881
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh my god, I'm going to take the
belt off.

1806
02:19:01,881 --> 02:19:04,552
SAM: You're going to lose your beard!

1807
02:19:04,552 --> 02:19:11,374
TRAVIS: You don't know that! This shit's in there
tight. I take the Belt of Dwarvenkind, and I put

1808
02:19:11,374 --> 02:19:14,837
it in the Bag of Holding. I put the Displacer
Cloak on.

1809
02:19:14,837 --> 02:19:21,170
MATT: You will be losing 26 hit points to your
maximum hit points.

1810
02:19:21,170 --> 02:19:22,936
TRAVIS: What? Wait! Really?

1811
02:19:22,936 --> 02:19:27,316
MATT: Your constitution-- or no, it's plus two, so
you'd be losing 13 hit points on your max hit points.

1812
02:19:27,316 --> 02:19:30,562
TRAVIS: Never mind, no. Nope.

1813
02:19:30,562 --> 02:19:33,174
MATT: Because your constitution will go down
without it.

1814
02:19:33,174 --> 02:19:35,671
LAURA: I can take off my Bracers of Archery, too,
and put something on--

1815
02:19:35,671 --> 02:19:37,452
MARISHA: What do those do?

1816
02:19:37,452 --> 02:19:40,031
LAURA: They just give me a plus two to damage
rolls.

1817
02:19:40,031 --> 02:19:44,169
LIAM: You're wearing a cloak, so if you wear the
boots, you can click them and you've got more

1818
02:19:44,169 --> 02:19:45,393
movement.

1819
02:19:45,393 --> 02:19:48,291
LAURA: All right. Give me the boots. I'm putting
the boots on.

1820
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:49,392
MATT: Boots of Haste?

1821
02:19:49,392 --> 02:19:57,644
MARISHA: Then I'll take the cloak, I guess. I'm
going to take off my spell slot ring. And I put my

1822
02:19:57,644 --> 02:20:03,012
goodie but my oldie circlet on.

1823
02:20:03,012 --> 02:20:05,988
SAM: Let's have a feast! Let's have a feast!

1824
02:20:05,988 --> 02:20:13,842
MATT: You guys prepare for the evening. You make
your way back to town. Where are you having your feast?

1825
02:20:13,842 --> 02:20:19,876
SAM: Isn't there a central place that we killed
Kevdak at?

1826
02:20:19,876 --> 02:20:23,193
MARISHA: The mayor's? The big mansion.

1827
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:25,195
SAM: Whatever that place is called.

1828
02:20:25,195 --> 02:20:26,800
MARISHA: The Margrave's house.

1829
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:33,590
MATT: All right. So you find your way to the
Margrave's town square there, you can see a number

1830
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:40,648
of the remaining Herd of Storms are sitting around
small fires in the center of the cobblestone.

1831
02:20:40,648 --> 02:20:48,999
They're all war-painted up, you can see there's
smears of various dark charcoal and/or crimson

1832
02:20:48,999 --> 02:20:59,536
liquid smeared across them in patterns. There is a
brimming tension of coming battle. You may do your

1833
02:20:59,536 --> 02:21:02,841
Heroes' Feast if you wish. You can feast up to 12
creatures as part of it.

1834
02:21:02,841 --> 02:21:08,643
MARISHA: I can also do a feast if I cast it at
seventh level. But, fuck it, I'm going to sleep,

1835
02:21:08,643 --> 02:21:10,047
so it doesn't matter.

1836
02:21:10,047 --> 02:21:13,332
SAM: You're going to do two feasts?

1837
02:21:13,332 --> 02:21:18,143
MARISHA: Pike and I are both going to cast Heroes'
Feast, so that way we can feast 24 people total.

1838
02:21:18,143 --> 02:21:20,472
MATT: All right.

1839
02:21:20,472 --> 02:21:28,461
MARISHA: So tell Kevdak. Sorry, fuck! Tell Zanror
his finest warriors, his druids--

1840
02:21:28,461 --> 02:21:30,004
LAURA: And Abjurist Noja.

1841
02:21:30,004 --> 02:21:31,523
TRAVIS: And Old Davin.

1842
02:21:31,523 --> 02:21:32,945
LIAM: And his wife.

1843
02:21:32,945 --> 02:21:40,949
MARISHA: So make sure we have Zanror, his wife,
his druids that he mentioned; there were like two

1844
02:21:40,949 --> 02:21:42,200
to three druids?

1845
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:45,887
ASHLEY: Are there any magic-users in the room?

1846
02:21:45,887 --> 02:21:47,949
TRAVIS: Magic-users or clerics.

1847
02:21:47,949 --> 02:21:49,763
MARISHA: Magic-users or clerics.

1848
02:21:49,763 --> 02:21:58,191
TRAVIS: Abjurist and Old Davin included.

1849
02:21:58,191 --> 02:22:10,125
MATT: So. That being the case. You guys have your
meals in the center of town, summoned forth a

1850
02:22:10,125 --> 02:22:16,584
grand Heroes' Feast, two side by side. The chosen
soldiers step up and you all begin to feast upon

1851
02:22:16,584 --> 02:22:21,530
your meal. The taste is great but you're all
distracted as the energies of the divine

1852
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:28,093
enchantment of these food items fill your body and
steel you against the coming fear, there is still

1853
02:22:28,093 --> 02:22:32,088
the concentration in your eye as you all look off
listlessly in the distance as you finish your

1854
02:22:32,088 --> 02:22:36,598
food. It's now just pushing past midnight.

1855
02:22:36,598 --> 02:22:39,582
LAURA: We need to sleep.

1856
02:22:39,582 --> 02:22:44,805
MATT: Everyone seems to go and find themselves to
rest, a tense sleep before them. Anything else you

1857
02:22:44,805 --> 02:22:46,460
wish to do before you go to bed?

1858
02:22:46,460 --> 02:22:49,431
MARISHA: Rise at sunrise? Rise at dawn?

1859
02:22:49,431 --> 02:22:52,896
TRAVIS: Wait, before we do that, didn't you do
something that gave us an extra amount of hit

1860
02:22:52,896 --> 02:22:54,840
points before Kevdak?

1861
02:22:54,840 --> 02:23:01,406
ASHLEY: I have Shield of Faith that I can put on
somebody.

1862
02:23:01,406 --> 02:23:03,892
LAURA: Will that last for 24 hours?

1863
02:23:03,892 --> 02:23:06,489
ASHLEY: It's up to ten minutes. I can do it
tomorrow.

1864
02:23:06,489 --> 02:23:11,788
MATT: What you're thinking of is Aid, and that
lasts for eight hours. That's the one that gives

1865
02:23:11,788 --> 02:23:14,090
the additional hit points he just mentioned.

1866
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:16,235
SAM: Does the Heroes' Feast give us additional hit
points?

1867
02:23:16,235 --> 02:23:21,157
MARISHA: 2d10, and you're immune to poison,
fear--

1868
02:23:21,157 --> 02:23:27,824
MATT: As temporary hit points, should mention that
too. It's a separate pool. So 2d10 additional hit

1869
02:23:27,824 --> 02:23:29,919
points. You want to roll, Keyleth?

1870
02:23:29,919 --> 02:23:36,302
MARISHA: Oh jeez. Don't let me fuck this up. Oh,
that's not bad. 14.

1871
02:23:36,302 --> 02:23:38,490
TRAVIS: 14? That's not bad.

1872
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:40,004
MARISHA: 14 from me.

1873
02:23:40,004 --> 02:23:40,926
ASHLEY: 12.

1874
02:23:40,926 --> 02:23:44,615
MATT: Okay, we'll say the 14 goes to your group,
the 12 goes to the rest of them for the purposes

1875
02:23:44,615 --> 02:23:48,184
of this. So that's a separate pool, the 14 hit
points come off first before anything else.

1876
02:23:48,184 --> 02:23:52,867
TRAVIS: If it's midnight, I would take Aid, just
in case he comes in the morning, and if he

1877
02:23:52,867 --> 02:23:55,491
doesn't, no harm done, you rest up anyway, right?

1878
02:23:55,491 --> 02:23:58,860
ASHLEY: Say it one more time.

1879
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:02,796
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind taking Aid in case he
comes in the morning. If eight hours pass I lose

1880
02:24:02,796 --> 02:24:04,608
it anyway, but you rest up again.

1881
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:05,942
ASHLEY: Do you want to have it for the night?

1882
02:24:05,942 --> 02:24:07,398
TRAVIS: Yeah, just in case he comes in the
morning.

1883
02:24:07,398 --> 02:24:08,794
ASHLEY: Sure.

1884
02:24:08,794 --> 02:24:11,781
MARISHA: Well, when do we want to be at the trap?
Dawn?

1885
02:24:11,781 --> 02:24:13,360
SAM: At dawn!

1886
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:15,050
LIAM: Just before.

1887
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:16,941
TRAVIS: Yeah, before first light.

1888
02:24:16,941 --> 02:24:19,272
LAURA: He comes normally around noon, he said.

1889
02:24:19,272 --> 02:24:22,959
MARISHA: So we need to be in our places by 5AM.

1890
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:30,072
ASHLEY: So each target's hit point maximum and
current hit points increase by five for the

1891
02:24:30,072 --> 02:24:31,246
duration.

1892
02:24:31,246 --> 02:24:34,508
MATT: For each level of the spell, so if you cast
it at higher levels, it's more.

1893
02:24:34,508 --> 02:24:36,300
TRAVIS: How high do you want to cast it?

1894
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:39,901
ASHLEY: Cast it at-- fifth is the highest that I
have now.

1895
02:24:39,901 --> 02:24:41,552
TRAVIS: Rock out. Go for it.

1896
02:24:41,552 --> 02:24:42,954
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do it.

1897
02:24:42,954 --> 02:24:44,568
TRAVIS: Five times five?

1898
02:24:44,568 --> 02:24:45,909
ASHLEY: That's, yeah.

1899
02:24:45,909 --> 02:24:47,542
SAM: You'll lose it when we wake up.

1900
02:24:47,542 --> 02:24:49,437
ASHLEY: Yeah, do you want it for tonight?

1901
02:24:49,437 --> 02:24:52,052
TRAVIS: It'll hold for eight hours, right, or, but
I lose it--

1902
02:24:52,052 --> 02:24:54,010
MATT: Eight hours, yes, but a long rest is eight
hours, so.

1903
02:24:54,010 --> 02:24:56,518
ASHLEY: Yeah, it'll go away. Let's wait.

1904
02:24:56,518 --> 02:24:59,447
MARISHA: What time of year is it?

1905
02:24:59,447 --> 02:25:06,551
MATT: It's winter cresting into spring--

1906
02:25:06,551 --> 02:25:09,604
MARISHA: Okay, so we have long nights right now.

1907
02:25:09,604 --> 02:25:11,402
LAURA: We need to go the fuck to sleep.

1908
02:25:11,402 --> 02:25:13,402
MARISHA: So let's sleep for a good six hours?

1909
02:25:13,402 --> 02:25:16,829
MATT: Six to eight hours.

1910
02:25:16,829 --> 02:25:18,389
LAURA: Set our alarm clocks.

1911
02:25:18,389 --> 02:25:21,882
MATT: You run on a pretty consistent schedule,
being a ranger.

1912
02:25:21,882 --> 02:25:28,143
LIAM: I wait until everyone falls still, and then
I scrabble over to you. Are you awake? Yeah,

1913
02:25:28,143 --> 02:25:29,110
you're awake.

1914
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:30,469
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm staring at you.

1915
02:25:30,469 --> 02:25:33,398
LIAM: I don't know if it's the food you made or
the fact that we're going to die tomorrow, but I

1916
02:25:33,398 --> 02:25:42,339
want to kiss you. And I kiss her. For a while.
Good night.

1917
02:25:42,339 --> 02:25:44,297
LAURA: Did you use your tongues?

1918
02:25:44,297 --> 02:25:45,886
TRAVIS: You're asleep.

1919
02:25:45,886 --> 02:25:47,553
MARISHA: How does she see everything?

1920
02:25:47,553 --> 02:25:49,761
LIAM: She's a witch.

1921
02:25:49,761 --> 02:25:51,303
MARISHA: She's a witch?

1922
02:25:51,303 --> 02:25:53,980
LIAM: She's a witch! Did you see the broom?

1923
02:25:53,980 --> 02:26:02,371
MATT: The evening's rest comes to fruition. You
guys wake up as the very distant, dull blues of

1924
02:26:02,371 --> 02:26:10,595
first morning light begins to crawl across the
distant mountain ranges. Dead silent is the

1925
02:26:10,595 --> 02:26:15,350
morning as the rest of the Herd begins to rouse
and armor up. You hear the gentle clank of metal

1926
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:23,292
against metal as armor and weapons are gathered.
Food is being prepared, cooked, and eaten without

1927
02:26:23,292 --> 02:26:25,551
a word being spoken between them.

1928
02:26:25,551 --> 02:26:33,397
SAM: I just want to make sure that we're going
around, passing out all the chains, attaching

1929
02:26:33,397 --> 02:26:36,863
little hooks and jabby things and grappling
hooks.

1930
02:26:36,863 --> 02:26:43,334
LAURA: They know the plan. As soon as he lands on
the ground, everybody springs up and--

1931
02:26:43,334 --> 02:26:46,352
MATT: Everyone springs up and hooks him.

1932
02:26:46,352 --> 02:26:51,002
SAM: If the trigger for that, they're going to be
underground--

1933
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:52,387
LAURA: The trap should go (snapping).

1934
02:26:52,387 --> 02:26:54,230
SAM: If they hear a big clank, that's go.

1935
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:55,491
LAURA: Get up and out. Yeah, regardless.

1936
02:26:55,491 --> 02:26:57,290
SAM: Will they know that that's a big clank?

1937
02:26:57,290 --> 02:27:00,339
LAURA: I'm sure it'll be pretty loud. There might
also be an explosion.

1938
02:27:00,339 --> 02:27:12,702
MATT: All right. With that, Zanror, after having
this discussion at the Margrave's makeshift war

1939
02:27:12,702 --> 02:27:20,436
room in the front foyer, agrees. "Not to worry.
I'll make sure the men have known. We'll sharpen

1940
02:27:20,436 --> 02:27:26,701
"the hooks sharp enough to dig into dragonhide,
hopefully. We'll hold taut, and the moment that

1941
02:27:26,701 --> 02:27:33,753
"creature breaks free, weapons are to fall on it.
Very well." He puts on the rest of his armor.

1942
02:27:33,753 --> 02:27:37,798
Everyone's feasted for the morning. We've lost
Taliesin.

1943
02:27:37,798 --> 02:27:43,018
SAM: Don't worry. His work is done. He made his
trap good.

1944
02:27:43,018 --> 02:27:45,895
MATT: It's like he's on the internet in Hawaii or
somewhere.

1945
02:27:45,895 --> 02:27:49,939
SAM: Let's do this.

1946
02:27:49,939 --> 02:27:57,308
ASHLEY: Right when I wake up, I am going to try
Divine Intervention.

1947
02:27:57,308 --> 02:27:59,427
MATT: Right now?

1948
02:27:59,427 --> 02:28:00,815
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1949
02:28:00,815 --> 02:28:07,542
MATT: Okay. Hold on just a second.

1950
02:28:07,542 --> 02:28:09,587
TRAVIS: Yeah man, it's as good a time as any.

1951
02:28:09,587 --> 02:28:11,764
SAM: Does it last for a while?

1952
02:28:11,764 --> 02:28:13,665
ASHLEY: I don't know.

1953
02:28:13,665 --> 02:28:15,174
LAURA: You used it before.

1954
02:28:15,174 --> 02:28:16,674
ASHLEY: No, it's never worked.

1955
02:28:16,674 --> 02:28:18,202
LAURA: Yeah, the guy showed up.

1956
02:28:18,202 --> 02:28:19,359
ASHLEY: That's something else.

1957
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:20,497
LAURA: Oh really?

1958
02:28:20,497 --> 02:28:23,759
ASHLEY: That wasn't intervention.

1959
02:28:23,759 --> 02:28:26,072
LAURA: I thought that was Divine Intervention that
made the guy show up.

1960
02:28:26,072 --> 02:28:28,174
ASHLEY: It's never worked.

1961
02:28:28,174 --> 02:28:38,487
MATT: So Divine Intervention, there are elements
of it that could be preparatory. By the nature of

1962
02:28:38,487 --> 02:28:46,187
it, it's more of a sudden prayer of desperation.
It's one of those things where the effects can

1963
02:28:46,187 --> 02:28:53,132
range. It can be something that's immediate; it
can be something that's more long. Understanding

1964
02:28:53,132 --> 02:29:03,899
that, acknowledge when would be the good time to
use it, whether it be now or later. Depends on

1965
02:29:03,899 --> 02:29:06,482
what you're requesting, what you're praying for.

1966
02:29:06,482 --> 02:29:17,122
ASHLEY: To come help us kill a dragon. So that.

1967
02:29:17,122 --> 02:29:20,585
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a percentile dice,
then.

1968
02:29:20,585 --> 02:29:22,748
ASHLEY: What do I have--

1969
02:29:22,748 --> 02:29:27,995
MATT: Roll 2d10. You may have a die that has
multiple numbers on it.

1970
02:29:27,995 --> 02:29:30,783
ASHLEY: I do. Is this the percentile?

1971
02:29:30,783 --> 02:29:38,946
MATT: Yes. Roll that first. What'd you roll?

1972
02:29:38,946 --> 02:29:40,953
ASHLEY: What do I need to roll?

1973
02:29:40,953 --> 02:29:48,195
MATT: I believe you need to roll under your level.
What did you roll?

1974
02:29:48,195 --> 02:29:51,085
ASHLEY: I rolled an 80.

1975
02:29:51,085 --> 02:29:52,544
MATT: Yeah.

1976
02:29:52,544 --> 02:29:53,990
ASHLEY: It never works!

1977
02:29:53,990 --> 02:30:01,943
MATT: So, as you call to Sarenrae, the boundaries
and barriers that keep the gods from directly

1978
02:30:01,943 --> 02:30:05,346
interfering with this realm are particularly
strong this morning.

1979
02:30:05,346 --> 02:30:10,947
While you feel her glow upon you, her warmth
and protection guiding you to victory, there is

1980
02:30:10,947 --> 02:30:14,306
not more within her strength or sphere of
influence she can grant you at this time.

1981
02:30:14,306 --> 02:30:17,377
ASHLEY: Dammit. I don't feel her warmth, though.

1982
02:30:17,377 --> 02:30:23,692
MATT: What else would you like to do?

1983
02:30:23,692 --> 02:30:26,436
ASHLEY: Just go eat.

1984
02:30:26,436 --> 02:30:37,688
MATT: All right, so the sun has come up, the hour
hits to eight, nine in the morning, you're looking

1985
02:30:37,688 --> 02:30:39,637
at about three hours until the dragon's--

1986
02:30:39,637 --> 02:30:42,292
MARISHA: Wait, what time is it?

1987
02:30:42,292 --> 02:30:43,449
SAM: It's nine.

1988
02:30:43,449 --> 02:30:45,649
MARISHA: Son of a bitch, we overslept.

1989
02:30:45,649 --> 02:30:47,450
SAM: No, we've been up since dawn.

1990
02:30:47,450 --> 02:30:51,338
MARISHA: I thought we were trying to get in places
before dawn.

1991
02:30:51,338 --> 02:30:53,089
SAM: Well, we're moving now. It'll be fine.

1992
02:30:53,089 --> 02:30:55,155
MARISHA: I hate it when I oversleep.

1993
02:30:55,155 --> 02:31:01,258
MATT: All right. The rest of you and the rest of
the Herd make your way north. The few people that

1994
02:31:01,258 --> 02:31:06,038
have stayed behind in the town, the few stalwart,
stand outside as you all march by, and they all

1995
02:31:06,038 --> 02:31:13,784
acknowledge, bow their heads, some get down on
their knees and pray for you as you pass. As you

1996
02:31:13,784 --> 02:31:21,005
quietly make your way outside of Westruun into the
plains between the dotted treed landscape towards

1997
02:31:21,005 --> 02:31:28,225
the drop point. The Herd makes its way under the
tunnel beneath the ground.

1998
02:31:28,225 --> 02:31:30,630
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

1999
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:40,314
MATT: All right. So they are now beneath the area.
They are situated. There is the entrance tunnel

2000
02:31:40,314 --> 02:31:45,506
off to the side that is currently visible and open
from that portion. Do you wish to close or hide

2001
02:31:45,506 --> 02:31:46,917
that tunnel?

2002
02:31:46,917 --> 02:31:49,681
MARISHA: Sure.

2003
02:31:49,681 --> 02:31:52,973
TRAVIS: I'm going in that tunnel, too.

2004
02:31:52,973 --> 02:31:59,410
LIAM: Scanlan. Where do you want to go?

2005
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:00,942
MATT: Grog, you have hidden--

2006
02:32:00,942 --> 02:32:02,520
SAM: I don't want to go underground.

2007
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,560
LIAM: Are we going in a tree?

2008
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:11,227
SAM: We're going to go up in a tree. Let's go 200
feet away.

2009
02:32:11,227 --> 02:32:17,284
ASHLEY: I'm going to run up to Scanlan and I'm
going to cast Death Ward on him.

2010
02:32:17,284 --> 02:32:20,212
SAM: What's that do?

2011
02:32:20,212 --> 02:32:23,235
TRAVIS: If you drop below zero, you come back to
one.

2012
02:32:23,235 --> 02:32:24,460
MATT: Once.

2013
02:32:24,460 --> 02:32:29,272
SAM: I don't need it. I'm okay. I know that you're
very worried about me because of our love, but--

2014
02:32:29,272 --> 02:32:33,379
MATT: So Scanlan, you have Death Ward on you. You
are now up in this tree here.

2015
02:32:33,379 --> 02:32:39,459
SAM: I don't need it. It jinxes me.

2016
02:32:39,459 --> 02:32:50,598
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Protection from Energy,
acid, onto Vax.

2017
02:32:50,598 --> 02:32:56,255
MATT: Vax actually already has resistance to acid
because of his armor.

2018
02:32:56,255 --> 02:32:57,886
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast it onto Vex.

2019
02:32:57,886 --> 02:32:59,626
LAURA: Thanks.

2020
02:32:59,626 --> 02:33:06,367
MATT: Okay. So Vex. Currently you have resistance
to acid as long as concentration remains.

2021
02:33:06,367 --> 02:33:10,682
MARISHA: I also cast Protection from Energy,
resistance to acid, on Grog.

2022
02:33:10,682 --> 02:33:12,805
MATT: Grog, you also have resistance to acid.

2023
02:33:12,805 --> 02:33:17,817
MARISHA: I'm going to stay in this cluster of
trees with Scanlan.

2024
02:33:17,817 --> 02:33:19,455
MATT: Scanlan over here, okay.

2025
02:33:19,455 --> 02:33:20,987
LAURA: I'm going to be up in a tree.

2026
02:33:20,987 --> 02:33:22,755
MATT: You're going to be up in the tree.

2027
02:33:22,755 --> 02:33:23,969
SAM: Different tree?

2028
02:33:23,969 --> 02:33:24,879
LAURA: Yeah.

2029
02:33:24,879 --> 02:33:26,775
SAM: I don't think we should all be in the same
tree, guys.

2030
02:33:26,775 --> 02:33:34,933
LAURA: No, I'm going to be in a different tree.
Can I use my perception to see how hidden

2031
02:33:34,933 --> 02:33:36,603
everything is?

2032
02:33:36,603 --> 02:33:40,277
MATT: We'll say up in this tree. You want to be up
in this one over here instead?

2033
02:33:40,277 --> 02:33:41,890
LAURA: Yeah, something far.

2034
02:33:41,890 --> 02:33:43,893
MATT: There we go. You'll be in this one.

2035
02:33:43,893 --> 02:33:50,351
LAURA: I think Percy wanted to be in a tree, too,
at a distance.

2036
02:33:50,351 --> 02:33:56,957
MATT: All right. We'll say Percy is over at this
one here, watching his trap hopefully spring.

2037
02:33:56,957 --> 02:34:01,870
LIAM: Vax is with Scanlan. Stuck like glue.

2038
02:34:01,870 --> 02:34:08,263
MATT: Is Trinket in your necklace?

2039
02:34:08,263 --> 02:34:10,273
LAURA: Yes.

2040
02:34:10,273 --> 02:34:13,257
MATT: All right. Where do you want to be? Did you
want to cast your Aid spell on anybody before this

2041
02:34:13,257 --> 02:34:14,526
happens?

2042
02:34:14,526 --> 02:34:15,743
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Yes.

2043
02:34:15,743 --> 02:34:19,607
SAM: Matt, we're more than 150 feet away, yes?

2044
02:34:19,607 --> 02:34:21,679
LAURA and MATT: Some people.

2045
02:34:21,679 --> 02:34:24,165
LAURA: Like the trees are 80 feet away from the
stuff.

2046
02:34:24,165 --> 02:34:25,657
MATT: This here?

2047
02:34:25,657 --> 02:34:28,738
SAM: I would like to be more than 150--

2048
02:34:28,738 --> 02:34:32,019
MATT: About 70-ish feet away is right here where
these trees are.

2049
02:34:32,019 --> 02:34:33,039
LAURA: Okay.

2050
02:34:33,039 --> 02:34:35,868
MATT: You're about 50-ish feet.

2051
02:34:35,868 --> 02:34:39,829
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Aid on Keyleth.

2052
02:34:39,829 --> 02:34:41,460
MATT: At what level?

2053
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:42,740
ASHLEY: Fourth.

2054
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:48,287
MATT: That's 15 additional hit points to Keyleth.

2055
02:34:48,287 --> 02:34:51,004
MARISHA: Additional or temporary?

2056
02:34:51,004 --> 02:34:54,195
MATT: Not temporary, additional. Keyleth, who
else?

2057
02:34:54,195 --> 02:34:56,745
ASHLEY: Scanlan, again.

2058
02:34:56,745 --> 02:34:59,763
MATT: Scanlan, and--?

2059
02:34:59,763 --> 02:35:01,964
SAM: Why don't you do it on yourself?

2060
02:35:01,964 --> 02:35:08,871
ASHLEY: Okay, I have low hit points. I'll do it on
myself. 15?

2061
02:35:08,871 --> 02:35:10,923
MATT: Yep, 15.

2062
02:35:10,923 --> 02:35:14,732
SAM: Keyleth, can you help me?

2063
02:35:14,732 --> 02:35:19,923
MATT: Do you cast it again, or are you just happy
with those people? You can cast it multiple times

2064
02:35:19,923 --> 02:35:21,703
if you have the spell levels for it.

2065
02:35:21,703 --> 02:35:23,468
ASHLEY: I'm going to save my spells.

2066
02:35:23,468 --> 02:35:24,555
MATT: Okay.

2067
02:35:24,555 --> 02:35:32,896
SAM: I'm going to need help. I know a little bit
about dragons. I don't know a ton. Can you help my

2068
02:35:32,896 --> 02:35:41,658
knowledge of animals in any way, shape, or form?
For some sort of a check, I don't know. I just want

2069
02:35:41,658 --> 02:35:46,952
to make sure that I know everything I can know in
the moment when checked.

2070
02:35:46,952 --> 02:35:49,487
LIAM: Can bards inspire themselves?

2071
02:35:49,487 --> 02:35:53,313
MATT: No. At higher levels, he can.

2072
02:35:53,313 --> 02:36:00,301
MARISHA: Theoretically, I could enhance your
ability, but it's a concentration spell and I've

2073
02:36:00,301 --> 02:36:02,643
already protected from acid against Grog.

2074
02:36:02,643 --> 02:36:04,349
SAM: Never mind. I'm fine.

2075
02:36:04,349 --> 02:36:05,926
MATT: All right.

2076
02:36:05,926 --> 02:36:09,382
MARISHA: What does your cloak do? That I put on?

2077
02:36:09,382 --> 02:36:11,062
LIAM: Disadvantage on attacking you.

2078
02:36:11,062 --> 02:36:12,256
MARISHA: Like, melee?

2079
02:36:12,256 --> 02:36:17,468
LIAM: Until you get hit, and then it's gone for
the round but resets for the next round.

2080
02:36:17,468 --> 02:36:20,088
MARISHA: Only melee, not spells, yeah?

2081
02:36:20,088 --> 02:36:21,246
LIAM: That's right.

2082
02:36:21,246 --> 02:36:29,195
MATT: So, at this point in time, Kevdak
approaches.

2083
02:36:29,195 --> 02:36:30,900
SAM: Zanror.

2084
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:44,823
MATT: I did it again. Zanror and two of his
goliaths stay there waiting, with the offering

2085
02:36:44,823 --> 02:36:47,210
placed at its designated spot.

2086
02:36:47,210 --> 02:36:49,399
MARISHA: Shit. I can't believe we're doing this.

2087
02:36:49,399 --> 02:36:51,996
MATT: Any last-minute preparations?

2088
02:36:51,996 --> 02:36:54,113
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- wait, Grog, where are you?

2089
02:36:54,113 --> 02:36:55,685
TRAVIS: I'm down in the tunnel.

2090
02:36:55,685 --> 02:36:59,225
ASHLEY: Is that where I am?

2091
02:36:59,225 --> 02:37:00,897
MATT: Well, wherever you want to be.

2092
02:37:00,897 --> 02:37:02,651
ASHLEY: I want to be in the trenches.

2093
02:37:02,651 --> 02:37:05,442
MATT: In the trenches? All right, so you make your
way into the trenches, pushing past all the rest

2094
02:37:05,442 --> 02:37:06,592
of the Herd members.

2095
02:37:06,592 --> 02:37:08,119
LAURA: I hide the hole.

2096
02:37:08,119 --> 02:37:14,441
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purposes of
this spread so everyone knows where they're all

2097
02:37:14,441 --> 02:37:15,462
hidden currently--

2098
02:37:15,462 --> 02:37:17,917
LAURA: Everyone knows they need to not move at all
and be completely--

2099
02:37:17,917 --> 02:37:18,801
MARISHA: Quiet.

2100
02:37:18,801 --> 02:37:20,272
TRAVIS: I'm down over here.

2101
02:37:20,272 --> 02:37:23,706
SAM: Pike, you're in the middle of it? Oh, shit.

2102
02:37:23,706 --> 02:37:28,596
ASHLEY: I'm just going to hide. I'm not going to
be a hero.

2103
02:37:28,596 --> 02:37:32,598
TRAVIS: I'll throw her out of there if something
goes wrong.

2104
02:37:32,598 --> 02:37:34,514
LIAM: She doesn't clank if she doesn't move.

2105
02:37:34,514 --> 02:37:38,520
ASHLEY: They'll see me shining with my shiny
armor.

2106
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:41,049
LAURA: You're right. We need to be stealthy up in
the trees.

2107
02:37:41,049 --> 02:37:52,615
MARISHA: I come over the earpiece in the calm of
battle and I say: if things go terribly wrong,

2108
02:37:52,615 --> 02:38:06,328
rush to this cluster of trees. I have ways that
can get us out. I feel like I should say something

2109
02:38:06,328 --> 02:38:08,604
inspiring, but I don't have anything, so--

2110
02:38:08,604 --> 02:38:10,004
TRAVIS: How about fuck shit up?

2111
02:38:10,004 --> 02:38:15,181
MARISHA: Fuck shit up, as Grog once said. About
two days ago.

2112
02:38:15,181 --> 02:38:26,472
MATT: Hiding off in this tree beneath you is Noja,
invisibility spell and vanishes behind. Beneath

2113
02:38:26,472 --> 02:38:41,631
the ground here, off to the side is your good
golem friend hidden in the dirt. Quiet sets in,

2114
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:52,600
gentle distant wind as the midday sun begins to
stroll through. It's quiet and quieter still. You

2115
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:59,325
can hear the gentle bristling of high
grasses against themselves. The tension causes the

2116
02:38:59,325 --> 02:39:07,598
muscles in the back of your shoulders and neck to
knot up. Watching the sun slowly crawl to its

2117
02:39:07,598 --> 02:39:25,684
zenith. (wingbeat noises) You look up, those of
you who are able, and you see a dark shape, a

2118
02:39:25,684 --> 02:39:38,699
shadow dart off from the top of Gatshadow. Circles
around, past you towards the city. Comes back.

2119
02:39:38,699 --> 02:39:58,884
Growing larger and larger as it does. As it comes
within the vicinity, it drifts up with one large

2120
02:39:58,884 --> 02:40:08,397
beat of its wings. And (impact sound) lands into
the center of this vicinity. As it hits the

2121
02:40:08,397 --> 02:40:17,165
ground, there is a tink! (creaking sound, impact)
As giant claws made of wood, metal, and rotten,

2122
02:40:17,165 --> 02:40:23,989
angry hooks slam up out of the dirt, sending a
giant cluster of dust just filling the vicinity.

2123
02:40:23,989 --> 02:40:32,999
It woosh-- wraps around, you hear the smashing of
metal and wood and low, guttural roaring. Dust has

2124
02:40:32,999 --> 02:40:37,816
filled the area, and, for a brief moment, you have
no visual on what's happened. As soon as that

2125
02:40:37,816 --> 02:40:45,200
hits, everyone around you in the tunnels bursts
through the floor, smashing through as the tunnels

2126
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:53,393
begin to collapse inward. Also, I need everybody
to go ahead and roll intiative.

2127
02:40:53,393 --> 02:40:56,223
ASHLEY: Did he move the treasure?

2128
02:40:56,223 --> 02:40:57,739
LAURA: Not yet.

2129
02:40:57,739 --> 02:41:03,167
LIAM: Come on meteorite die, don't dick me.

2130
02:41:03,167 --> 02:41:06,525
MARISHA: Green, lucky jade. That's okay.

2131
02:41:06,525 --> 02:41:08,761
LIAM: Matt Colville, this is on you.

2132
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:10,820
SAM: It's not you, Liam, it's me.

2133
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:12,871
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

2134
02:41:12,871 --> 02:41:18,437
SAM: Not good. Liam, yours doesn't matter. Mine
does.

2135
02:41:18,437 --> 02:41:19,805
MARISHA: Is yours not good?

2136
02:41:19,805 --> 02:41:20,731
SAM: No.

2137
02:41:20,731 --> 02:41:22,946
LAURA: What did you roll?

2138
02:41:22,946 --> 02:41:26,118
SAM: It's okay, we got this. Pike's going to win
the fight for us.

2139
02:41:26,118 --> 02:41:27,562
LIAM: Hey, can I use Luck for initiative?

2140
02:41:27,562 --> 02:41:32,093
MATT: What does it say for the ability?

2141
02:41:32,093 --> 02:41:35,063
SAM: It doesn't matter, Liam.

2142
02:41:35,063 --> 02:41:39,971
MATT: I'll find out here. It counts as an ability
check. I don't see why it wouldn't.

2143
02:41:39,971 --> 02:41:43,530
LIAM: It's up to you. You're the boss. I love you.
You're the all-seeing eye.

2144
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:47,812
SAM: The feast gives us advantage on all
initiative checks, right?

2145
02:41:47,812 --> 02:41:55,220
MATT: Ability check or saving throw-- technically,
you get plus two to ability checks, correct? I'd

2146
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:59,111
say, sure, you can reroll initiative if you want.

2147
02:41:59,111 --> 02:42:03,306
LIAM: (laughs) It was the exact same number!

2148
02:42:03,306 --> 02:42:10,679
MATT: You use the Luck point, and your initiative
is what it is. Starting at this point in time,

2149
02:42:10,679 --> 02:42:12,215
everybody--

2150
02:42:12,215 --> 02:42:13,628
SAM: It's a fight.

2151
02:42:13,628 --> 02:42:16,317
MATT: We have 25 to 20.

2152
02:42:16,317 --> 02:42:18,357
LAURA: 22.

2153
02:42:18,357 --> 02:42:19,622
TRAVIS: 20.

2154
02:42:19,622 --> 02:42:26,690
MATT: All right, 22. Vex. The Herd actually rolled
really well.

2155
02:42:26,690 --> 02:42:29,370
SAM: Good, we need that.

2156
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:34,124
MATT: Grog. All right, 20 to 15.

2157
02:42:34,124 --> 02:42:35,874
TALIESIN: 19.

2158
02:42:35,874 --> 02:42:49,413
MATT: 19 for Percy. Is that it? So we have-- Noja.
15 to ten?

2159
02:42:49,413 --> 02:42:52,632
LIAM: Big ten, which if you think about it rounded
is like 100.

2160
02:42:52,632 --> 02:42:57,071
MARISHA: Also big ten, which if you round it twice
is like a thousand.

2161
02:42:57,071 --> 02:43:02,370
ASHLEY: 13.

2162
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:09,463
MATT: All right. Ten to five.

2163
02:43:09,463 --> 02:43:11,218
SAM: Big five.

2164
02:43:11,218 --> 02:43:14,409
MATT: Big five, right there. Scanlan holding up
the rear, there we go.

2165
02:43:14,409 --> 02:43:16,285
LIAM: Gosh, plan B indeed.

2166
02:43:16,285 --> 02:43:26,566
MATT: At the top of this surprise round, I need
Vex to go first.

2167
02:43:26,566 --> 02:43:33,706
LAURA: Am I first?

2168
02:43:33,706 --> 02:43:35,611
MARISHA: You've got, no, he has Fassbender.

2169
02:43:35,611 --> 02:43:42,167
LAURA: He has Fassbender. I guess I'm just going
to shoot it. I mean, what else can I do right now?

2170
02:43:42,167 --> 02:43:43,767
LIAM: You do you!

2171
02:43:43,767 --> 02:43:45,957
LAURA: All right. My Boots of Haste have been
clicked.

2172
02:43:45,957 --> 02:43:50,554
MATT: All right, so you are now hasted. You may
now have an additional attack action per turn.

2173
02:43:50,554 --> 02:43:54,271
LAURA: Badass. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

2174
02:43:54,271 --> 02:43:56,186
MATT: All right.

2175
02:43:56,186 --> 02:44:02,767
LAURA: Wait. Yeah, because I'm still hidden in the
tree, right?

2176
02:44:02,767 --> 02:44:06,947
MATT: Correct, currently. As far as you know.
Hunter's Mark on Umbrasyl.

2177
02:44:06,947 --> 02:44:13,079
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. I'm
going to shoot him with my Longbow of the Sky

2178
02:44:13,079 --> 02:44:16,282
Sentinel. So I'm going to roll.

2179
02:44:16,282 --> 02:44:21,756
MATT: Go for it. Now, he is surprised, so you
actually have--

2180
02:44:21,756 --> 02:44:23,999
LAURA: Advantage.

2181
02:44:23,999 --> 02:44:26,277
MATT: Well, you have advantage because he doesn't
see you, so yeah.

2182
02:44:26,277 --> 02:44:34,293
LAURA: Okay, so the first one is 12 plus 15 is
23.

2183
02:44:34,293 --> 02:44:35,387
MATT: 23?

2184
02:44:35,387 --> 02:44:36,317
LAURA: 27.

2185
02:44:36,317 --> 02:44:37,588
MATT: 27 hits.

2186
02:44:37,588 --> 02:44:41,484
LAURA: 25.

2187
02:44:41,484 --> 02:44:42,963
MATT: 25 hits.

2188
02:44:42,963 --> 02:44:47,355
LAURA: And 23.

2189
02:44:47,355 --> 02:44:48,917
MATT: 23 hits.

2190
02:44:48,917 --> 02:45:00,865
LAURA: So. Okay, those are regular attack plus
lightning arrow attack, right? I all of a sudden

2191
02:45:00,865 --> 02:45:08,828
forget how it works. Plus 1d6 per arrow. 1d6 for
the Hunter's Mark. And then 1d6 on the first one

2192
02:45:08,828 --> 02:45:13,867
for the sneak attack. Okay. Plus the regular.

2193
02:45:13,867 --> 02:45:19,544
MATT: Herd's up next, and then Grog.

2194
02:45:19,544 --> 02:45:24,380
LAURA: 31 on the first arrow.

2195
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,946
MATT: 31 damage?

2196
02:45:25,946 --> 02:45:27,077
LAURA: Yes.

2197
02:45:27,077 --> 02:45:28,295
MATT: Nice!

2198
02:45:28,295 --> 02:45:30,878
LIAM: Seven plus five is 12.

2199
02:45:30,878 --> 02:45:34,659
LAURA: 12. Plus nine.

2200
02:45:34,659 --> 02:45:41,849
MATT: 21. You're not getting additional sneak
attack for the other two hits, by the way.

2201
02:45:41,899 --> 02:45:46,545
LAURA: Right, I know. I lost my-- 18, I think. 18
was the last one.

2202
02:45:46,545 --> 02:45:50,301
MATT: All right. So that was your Sky Sentinel
attack.

2203
02:45:50,301 --> 02:45:51,717
LAURA: That was my first attack.

2204
02:45:51,717 --> 02:45:52,735
MATT: Correct.

2205
02:45:52,735 --> 02:45:59,290
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to shoot
him with one of my dragon arrows. Should I waste

2206
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,447
it on him?

2207
02:46:00,447 --> 02:46:02,254
SAM: Of course, he's a dragon! This is it!

2208
02:46:02,254 --> 02:46:07,644
LAURA: I have two of them. I've been saving one,
but I'm going to use one on him.

2209
02:46:07,644 --> 02:46:09,064
MATT: All right.

2210
02:46:09,064 --> 02:46:16,406
LAURA: This is still advantage because it's still
surprise round, right?

2211
02:46:16,406 --> 02:46:17,475
MATT: Sure.

2212
02:46:17,475 --> 02:46:18,855
LAURA: Okay. 24.

2213
02:46:18,855 --> 02:46:20,144
MATT: 24 hits.

2214
02:46:20,144 --> 02:46:29,304
LAURA: Okay. That's still my Hunter's Mark, and
then-- I have a Jelly Belly in my thing-- And then

2215
02:46:29,304 --> 02:46:36,217
that's 10d6 additional damage for the dragon
arrow.

2216
02:46:36,217 --> 02:46:40,254
MATT: Okay, surprise round doesn't give you
advantage, but you were hidden from the top of the

2217
02:46:40,254 --> 02:46:41,469
round, so you have advantage.

2218
02:46:41,469 --> 02:46:48,157
LAURA: Oh, okay. So an additional 10d6 damage for
the dragon arrow.

2219
02:46:48,157 --> 02:46:50,483
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

2220
02:46:50,483 --> 02:46:53,486
LAURA: No. 6d10. Sorry, my mistake.

2221
02:46:53,486 --> 02:46:54,508
MATT: There you go.

2222
02:46:54,508 --> 02:46:56,345
SAM: She's going to one-shot the dragon.

2223
02:46:56,345 --> 02:47:09,849
LAURA: 6d10. (counting)

2224
02:47:09,849 --> 02:47:15,367
SAM: Matt, can I turn around and see Keyleth and
Vax making out in the tree behind me?

2225
02:47:15,367 --> 02:47:17,421
MATT: They are not.

2226
02:47:17,421 --> 02:47:22,852
LIAM: We're not making out! There's a slow trickle
of wizz going down my leg right now, man.

2227
02:47:22,852 --> 02:47:25,593
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm hyperventilating.

2228
02:47:25,593 --> 02:47:39,454
LAURA: Sorry. 24 plus ten is 34 plus Hunter's Mark
is another four. 38 on that attack.

2229
02:47:39,454 --> 02:47:41,866
MATT: 38 points of damage on the dragon-slaying
arrow.

2230
02:47:41,866 --> 02:47:48,846
LAURA: And then my third attack, I'm going to use
the Blazing Bowstring.

2231
02:47:48,846 --> 02:47:53,666
MATT: Just so you guys are aware, this is over 100
points of damage in one round.

2232
02:47:53,666 --> 02:47:56,455
LIAM: Enjoy those boots.

2233
02:47:56,455 --> 02:47:59,742
LAURA: Do I still get advantage, because I'm still
hidden?

2234
02:47:59,742 --> 02:48:04,849
MATT: No. At this point in time, I'll say you've
definitely made yourself known.

2235
02:48:04,849 --> 02:48:06,153
LAURA: 20?

2236
02:48:06,153 --> 02:48:08,099
MATT: Technically you shouldn't have had advantage
on the other ones, but--

2237
02:48:08,099 --> 02:48:09,527
LAURA: 20?

2238
02:48:09,527 --> 02:48:13,215
MATT: Pssh, arrow splinters across the hide, no
effect.

2239
02:48:13,215 --> 02:48:15,760
LAURA: Okay. Wow.

2240
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:18,904
MATT: All right. Staying there?

2241
02:48:18,904 --> 02:48:29,470
LAURA: I'm going to sink down into the leaves,
yes, and try to hide better.

2242
02:48:29,470 --> 02:48:32,466
MATT: You have no actions to hide, but you're in a
tree.

2243
02:48:32,466 --> 02:48:33,617
LAURA: Okay.

2244
02:48:33,617 --> 02:48:42,858
MATT: All right. Finishing your turn, the Herd now
is going to go. Shot from here, he's going to stay back.

2245
02:48:42,858 --> 02:48:50,620
All move in, he's going to stay back here and aim.
They can't even get in; there's so many of them.

2246
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:55,761
LAURA: I'm trying to duck behind some branches so
he doesn't have direct line of sights on me, okay?

2247
02:48:55,761 --> 02:48:57,334
MATT: That's fine.

2248
02:48:57,334 --> 02:49:00,949
SAM: Man, what if this was all a trick and they
actually work for him? Oh god, we're all going to

2249
02:49:00,949 --> 02:49:05,556
die. It was all a trick! They work for him.
They're going to kill us all!

2250
02:49:05,556 --> 02:49:14,668
TRAVIS: If I were near you, I would slap you. Get
a hold of yourself, man!

2251
02:49:14,668 --> 02:49:20,270
MATT: Throwing chains up, some of them leap up and
jab the actual hook into the side and try to pull

2252
02:49:20,270 --> 02:49:24,475
back. Having a hard time piercing hide. It's real
strong.

2253
02:49:24,475 --> 02:49:33,622
LAURA: Some of them can try to like swing the
grapplings around the ankles--

2254
02:49:33,622 --> 02:49:37,446
SAM: Shh, don't distract him, he's adding.

2255
02:49:37,446 --> 02:49:39,452
MATT: I got this, don't worry.

2256
02:49:39,452 --> 02:49:41,381
LIAM: Don't piss him off.

2257
02:49:41,381 --> 02:49:47,257
MATT: All right. We'll say about eight of them
manage to actually get it into the hide. The rest

2258
02:49:47,257 --> 02:49:51,520
either bounce off or can't find purchase into its
hide and it just scrapes down, but the rest of

2259
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,858
them are trying to hold it down. "We got him! We
got him!" And they're holding back. The archers

2260
02:49:56,858 --> 02:50:09,204
all take aim. Misses, misses, misses, misses,
hits.

2261
02:50:09,204 --> 02:50:14,214
LIAM: Question. Did we give the chain attached to
Fassbender to one of the goliaths?

2262
02:50:14,214 --> 02:50:16,854
SAM: No, it's buried in the stone.

2263
02:50:16,854 --> 02:50:20,353
LIAM: To the stone, but one has to go on the
dragon.

2264
02:50:20,353 --> 02:50:22,312
SAM: If that's what we planned, sure.

2265
02:50:22,312 --> 02:50:26,954
LIAM: I don't know.

2266
02:50:26,954 --> 02:50:28,973
MATT: You didn't tell Fassbender to use it.

2267
02:50:28,973 --> 02:50:31,298
LIAM: Oh, no. Okay. Cool.

2268
02:50:31,298 --> 02:50:35,142
MATT: That's two hits for all the arrows. All the
rest of them are just smashing against the hide of

2269
02:50:35,142 --> 02:50:44,868
Umbrasyl. No effect. That is seven points of
damage and eight points of damage. They actually

2270
02:50:44,868 --> 02:50:49,449
make it through. That's their round. Grog, you're
up.

2271
02:50:49,449 --> 02:50:58,485
TRAVIS: I go into a rage, and I would like to run
up behind him with my Bloodaxe and make two

2272
02:50:58,485 --> 02:51:00,704
reckless attacks against him.

2273
02:51:00,704 --> 02:51:08,280
LIAM: He's got it. He's got a whole strategy. He's
street-smart, this guy.

2274
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:10,691
SAM: Intelligence of three.

2275
02:51:10,691 --> 02:51:12,078
TRAVIS: 26.

2276
02:51:12,078 --> 02:51:13,360
MATT: 26 hits.

2277
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:17,118
TRAVIS: That's really good. 28.

2278
02:51:17,118 --> 02:51:18,663
MATT: 28 hits.

2279
02:51:18,663 --> 02:51:32,405
TRAVIS: So, that's 23 with three points of
necrotic damage.

2280
02:51:32,405 --> 02:51:36,339
MATT: 23, three points of necrotic damage added in
or on top of that?

2281
02:51:36,339 --> 02:51:37,842
TRAVIS: Oh, that's part of it, yeah.

2282
02:51:37,842 --> 02:51:39,389
MATT: 23. All right.

2283
02:51:39,389 --> 02:51:48,176
TRAVIS: And then the second one-- 22 with one
point of necrotic damage.

2284
02:51:48,176 --> 02:51:55,559
MATT: Gotcha. Whack! Whack! It's a tough hide to
cut into, but you're making small hacks into it.

2285
02:51:55,559 --> 02:52:02,651
You can start seeing that damage is possible,
though it's a lot to cut through. This is a very

2286
02:52:02,651 --> 02:52:06,351
hefty, very old beast. All right.

2287
02:52:06,351 --> 02:52:17,249
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, could I drink the
potion of fast nuts? Potion of speed.

2288
02:52:17,249 --> 02:52:19,795
MATT: Well, isn't it a bonus action to go into a
rage?

2289
02:52:19,795 --> 02:52:23,126
TRAVIS: I believe you're right. Never mind.

2290
02:52:23,126 --> 02:52:27,526
MATT: Pretty sure it is. Let me double-check real
fast.

2291
02:52:27,526 --> 02:52:29,543
TRAVIS: I think you're right.

2292
02:52:29,543 --> 02:52:42,129
MATT: It's fine, yeah. Bonus action. So that's
your turn? Percy, you're up. You're way behind the

2293
02:52:42,129 --> 02:52:46,235
dragon, hiding by the treeside.

2294
02:52:46,235 --> 02:52:49,141
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to cast Hex on the
dragon.

2295
02:52:49,141 --> 02:52:51,325
MATT: All right, Hex on the dragon.

2296
02:52:51,325 --> 02:52:58,120
TALIESIN: With a disadvantage to all strength
checks.

2297
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,680
MATT: Strength ability checks, okay.

2298
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:06,083
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my turn until the
dragon's turn.

2299
02:53:06,083 --> 02:53:09,573
MATT: Okay. You're just going to hold until it
does something?

2300
02:53:09,573 --> 02:53:12,714
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold until it does
something, and if it does nothing, I'm taking my

2301
02:53:12,714 --> 02:53:16,005
attacks, and if it gets away I'm taking my
attacks. I'm just taking my attacks after him.

2302
02:53:16,005 --> 02:53:29,250
MATT: Okay. It is now Noja's turn. Noja is going
to step out from here and is going to attempt to

2303
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:35,906
Lightning Bolt. From the side, he just reaches
out, hand forward. Arcs upward in its direction.

2304
02:53:35,906 --> 02:53:48,602
It fails its saving throw because it is held in
there. It is currently considered grappled. It

2305
02:53:48,602 --> 02:53:52,548
doesn't have disadvantage or anything, but I'll
say from this standpoint it can't really move

2306
02:53:52,548 --> 02:53:58,049
around a lot. It's going to take the damage.

2307
02:53:58,049 --> 02:54:02,723
SAM: (laughs) What was that face?

2308
02:54:02,723 --> 02:54:08,825
MATT: Terrible roll. 21 points of lightning
damage.

2309
02:54:08,825 --> 02:54:13,329
SAM: That's 8d6.

2310
02:54:13,329 --> 02:54:18,269
MATT: At the end of his turn, it's going to use
one of its legendary actions to make a tail attack

2311
02:54:18,269 --> 02:54:26,937
against you. We'll say that'll be 27 to hit.

2312
02:54:26,937 --> 02:54:28,415
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

2313
02:54:28,415 --> 02:54:36,208
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words on the attack or to
reduce the attack?

2314
02:54:36,208 --> 02:54:37,787
MATT: If you want to.

2315
02:54:37,787 --> 02:54:39,356
SAM: I would like to.

2316
02:54:39,356 --> 02:54:44,424
MATT: Okay, so 27 to hit. You take, from the slam
of its tail behind you--

2317
02:54:44,424 --> 02:54:46,828
SAM: No, I mean to, I'm sorry, I can't reduce
the--

2318
02:54:46,828 --> 02:54:48,738
MATT: Oh, I thought, to reduce the <i>attack</i> not
the damage.

2319
02:54:48,738 --> 02:54:49,982
SAM: The attack.

2320
02:54:49,982 --> 02:54:51,856
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll your d10.

2321
02:54:51,856 --> 02:54:59,534
SAM: Okay. (slide-whistle) A d10 is this one.
Ten.

2322
02:54:59,534 --> 02:55:02,347
MATT: Ten. 17. What's your AC?

2323
02:55:02,347 --> 02:55:03,760
TRAVIS: It's a 20.

2324
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:10,003
MATT: 20. With that, the tail-- whack!-- slams
into the ground. You manage to push out of the way

2325
02:55:10,003 --> 02:55:13,383
just in time as Scanlan shouts up to the dragon.

2326
02:55:13,383 --> 02:55:22,474
SAM: Oi! You're so ugly you entered an ugly
contest and they said no professionals!

2327
02:55:22,474 --> 02:55:25,999
(laughter)

2328
02:55:25,999 --> 02:55:30,663
MATT: Just enough of a distraction in the settling
dirt for the dragon to turn its head over and its

2329
02:55:30,663 --> 02:55:46,934
tail swings just a little wide of you, Grog, as
you sidestep, no effect. We'll say for this, it's

2330
02:55:46,934 --> 02:55:55,701
less of a surprise round. I use surprise round
liberally. Surprise was it grappling and everyone

2331
02:55:55,701 --> 02:55:58,484
getting out of it and preparing for the actual
assault.

2332
02:55:58,484 --> 02:56:00,985
LIAM: It's more of a <i>surprising</i> round.

2333
02:56:00,985 --> 02:56:08,571
MATT: Correct. Umbrasyl does get a turn. Umbrasyl,
very frustrated and angry at the circumstance, is

2334
02:56:08,571 --> 02:56:21,838
going to attempt to break free. With disadvantage
on the athletics check to try and break out of the

2335
02:56:21,838 --> 02:56:27,003
grapple because of the Hex. All right. That is--

2336
02:56:27,003 --> 02:56:29,539
SAM: Is that a save?

2337
02:56:29,539 --> 02:56:38,904
MATT: No, it's not a save. It's an ability check.
However, the strength-- (struggling sounds) cannot

2338
02:56:38,904 --> 02:56:47,505
seem to break free from the grapple of the
communal might of all the goliaths there. So that

2339
02:56:47,505 --> 02:56:48,859
is unhappy.

2340
02:56:48,859 --> 02:56:54,337
SAM: Meaning Matt is unhappy.

2341
02:56:54,337 --> 02:56:57,081
MATT: All righty.

2342
02:56:57,081 --> 02:57:02,078
SAM: And three more dragons.

2343
02:57:02,078 --> 02:57:03,858
MARISHA: Why the book?

2344
02:57:03,858 --> 02:57:07,203
LAURA: Oh no, what are we looking up?

2345
02:57:07,203 --> 02:57:08,918
TRAVIS: What's in the book?

2346
02:57:08,918 --> 02:57:10,168
MATT: Nothing's in the book, guys.

2347
02:57:10,168 --> 02:57:11,917
LAURA: We're literally going to finish off this
bag of Jelly Bellies.

2348
02:57:11,917 --> 02:57:16,309
LIAM: If an ancient black dragon takes one hit
point of damage, it cowers and dies.

2349
02:57:16,309 --> 02:57:19,709
ASHLEY: I'm looking for the popcorn ones.

2350
02:57:19,709 --> 02:57:22,298
MARISHA: Thanks to whomever sent these Jelly
Bellies, by the way.

2351
02:57:22,298 --> 02:57:28,421
MATT: That'll end Umbrasyl's turn. That brings us
to Pike, you're up.

2352
02:57:28,421 --> 02:57:31,701
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's my turn now.

2353
02:57:31,701 --> 02:57:33,182
MATT: Percy's up, then.

2354
02:57:33,182 --> 02:57:37,142
TALIESIN: I'm going to take just a standard shot
with Bad News.

2355
02:57:37,142 --> 02:57:38,749
MATT: Go for it.

2356
02:57:38,749 --> 02:57:43,130
TALIESIN: Ooh. 28 to hit.

2357
02:57:43,130 --> 02:57:44,647
MATT: 28 hits.

2358
02:57:44,647 --> 02:57:59,127
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage, with four necrotic.
18 points of damage.

2359
02:57:59,127 --> 02:58:00,727
MATT: All righty.

2360
02:58:00,727 --> 02:58:02,535
TALIESIN: And I'll take another shot with Bad
News.

2361
02:58:02,535 --> 02:58:05,588
MATT: Go for it.

2362
02:58:05,588 --> 02:58:08,616
TALIESIN: 20 to hit.

2363
02:58:08,616 --> 02:58:10,513
MATT: 20 does not hit.

2364
02:58:10,513 --> 02:58:11,628
TALIESIN: All right.

2365
02:58:11,628 --> 02:58:14,993
MATT: Second shot just goes wide, firing off into
the distance over the city of Westruun.

2366
02:58:14,993 --> 02:58:18,158
TALIESIN: All right. Turn's up.

2367
02:58:18,158 --> 02:58:19,735
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up.

2368
02:58:19,735 --> 02:58:22,460
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt.

2369
02:58:22,460 --> 02:58:25,640
SAM: Be beautiful! Be good!

2370
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:27,151
LAURA: At what level?

2371
02:58:27,151 --> 02:58:35,042
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- at third. Let me see this.

2372
02:58:35,042 --> 02:58:38,270
LIAM: Is this an attack range thing, or does it
automatically--?

2373
02:58:38,270 --> 02:58:40,146
MATT: Spell attack roll, so you roll--

2374
02:58:40,146 --> 02:58:45,320
ASHLEY: And then I add that? That would be a 29.

2375
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:47,313
MATT: 29. Damn, what did you roll?

2376
02:58:47,313 --> 02:58:48,675
ASHLEY: I rolled a 19.

2377
02:58:48,675 --> 02:58:49,939
MATT: That's nice. That'll hit.

2378
02:58:49,939 --> 02:58:54,435
ASHLEY: Okay, so now I do--

2379
02:58:54,435 --> 02:59:01,931
LAURA: 4d6 plus two more d6.

2380
02:59:01,931 --> 02:59:24,269
ASHLEY: 26.

2381
02:59:24,269 --> 02:59:26,268
MATT: 26 points of damage.

2382
02:59:26,268 --> 02:59:27,631
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2383
02:59:27,631 --> 02:59:34,093
MATT: All right. And the next attack against it
has advantage. So Pike, you're staying. You popped

2384
02:59:34,093 --> 02:59:38,370
out of the trench and you're up on the ground. You
hit it with the Guiding Bolt. You can see the

2385
02:59:38,370 --> 02:59:42,908
blast of divine energy streaks up and slams into
Umbrasyl's side. The darkened black scales now

2386
02:59:42,908 --> 02:59:47,002
have this shining beacon across the torso.
Anything else you want to do with your turn, or is

2387
02:59:47,002 --> 02:59:48,461
that it? You want to move?

2388
02:59:48,461 --> 02:59:56,657
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to stay.

2389
02:59:56,657 --> 02:59:57,924
MATT: All right.

2390
02:59:57,924 --> 03:00:18,903
ASHLEY: But I'm also going to put a Spiritual
Weapon, just a sword again. Can't think of

2391
03:00:18,903 --> 03:00:20,618
anything right now because I'm nervous.

2392
03:00:20,618 --> 03:00:26,907
MATT: We'll say right here in this area around
Umbrasyl. The magical light sword of Sarenrae once

2393
03:00:26,907 --> 03:00:35,904
again forges itself underneath Umbrasyl, swings up
towards-- Let's see, you did Guiding Bolt at what level?

2394
03:00:35,904 --> 03:00:37,625
ASHLEY: Three.

2395
03:00:37,625 --> 03:00:45,710
MATT: Third level. And Spiritual Weapon is second
level. So that works. Lasts for a minute. Make a

2396
03:00:45,710 --> 03:00:47,710
spell attack. Roll again.

2397
03:00:47,710 --> 03:00:52,522
ASHLEY: 19.

2398
03:00:52,522 --> 03:00:59,457
MATT: 19 total? The blade swings up and as it
strikes against the dragon's armor, sparks of

2399
03:00:59,457 --> 03:01:03,102
divine energy versus the scales streak, but no
damage is done. The blade is unable to strike

2400
03:01:03,102 --> 03:01:06,967
through the hide. Does that end your turn, Pike?
Are you staying where you are?

2401
03:01:06,967 --> 03:01:10,395
SAM: Did you add your spell attack bonus?

2402
03:01:10,395 --> 03:01:11,740
LAURA: Yeah, she did.

2403
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:13,577
MATT: All right. You going to move, stay where you
are?

2404
03:01:13,577 --> 03:01:14,919
ASHLEY: I'll stay where I am.

2405
03:01:14,919 --> 03:01:16,729
MATT: Ending Pike's turn, Vax, you're up.

2406
03:01:16,729 --> 03:01:28,935
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn until Scanlan, no.
Yeah, I'm going to-- Fassbender, slow the fucking

2407
03:01:28,935 --> 03:01:30,570
dragon down now!

2408
03:01:30,570 --> 03:01:36,860
MATT: Okay, at which point suddenly dust streaks
upward as Fassbender steps up out of the hiding

2409
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:50,073
place there. Fassbender focuses his arms out as
the slow magic effect seems to take on towards it.

2410
03:01:50,073 --> 03:01:51,693
What's the DC on it?

2411
03:01:51,693 --> 03:01:54,373
LIAM: Oh, dear god. That's a good question.

2412
03:01:54,373 --> 03:01:56,050
SAM: Who has the Fassbender stats?

2413
03:01:56,050 --> 03:01:57,822
LIAM: I've got it. Slow-- 17.

2414
03:01:57,822 --> 03:02:00,559
MATT: 17. And that's a wisdom?

2415
03:02:00,559 --> 03:02:06,177
LIAM: It is wisdom. And Fassbender, just slow
until the end of tomorrow, just keep going.

2416
03:02:06,177 --> 03:02:09,907
MATT: It rolled a ten plus nine, succeeds in the
save.

2417
03:02:09,907 --> 03:02:17,648
SAM: Wisdom disadvantage save. I have Cutting
Words-ed him.

2418
03:02:17,648 --> 03:02:20,694
MATT: That's true. Rolled even higher.

2419
03:02:20,694 --> 03:02:26,602
LIAM: Question: he'll just keep doing that until I
tell him to stop, right?

2420
03:02:26,602 --> 03:02:29,932
MATT: Yeah, but it has to recharge. If it doesn't,
he might just start hitting it.

2421
03:02:29,932 --> 03:02:35,274
MARISHA: He's got to roll to see if it recharges.
It'll recharge on a five or a six.

2422
03:02:35,274 --> 03:02:39,727
LIAM: Okay. With my bonus action, I drink that
potion and I'm a tiny Vax.

2423
03:02:39,727 --> 03:02:44,734
MATT: Okay! With that, you have shrunk down to a
small-sized creature.

2424
03:02:44,734 --> 03:02:46,804
LIAM: (high-pitched) Do it, Scanlan, do it!

2425
03:02:46,804 --> 03:02:50,393
SAM: I think this is the first time I've ever been
taller than you.

2426
03:02:50,393 --> 03:02:55,674
LIAM: (high-pitched) Hey, buddy! I love ya. Let's
go in that dragon's gut.

2427
03:02:55,674 --> 03:02:57,997
SAM: I don't particularly like small people.

2428
03:02:57,997 --> 03:03:02,816
LIAM: (high-pitched) Do you think Keyleth will
think less of me?

2429
03:03:02,816 --> 03:03:04,260
SAM: Yes, I do.

2430
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:07,395
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

2431
03:03:07,395 --> 03:03:09,612
LIAM: Yeah, action, bonus action. Done

2432
03:03:09,612 --> 03:03:15,016
MATT: So Vax is actually like a few inches
shorter than you. You're now towering over him.

2433
03:03:15,016 --> 03:03:16,875
SAM: I tousle his hair.

2434
03:03:16,875 --> 03:03:20,005
LIAM: I'm like eight inches tall, if that's true!
He's so small!

2435
03:03:20,005 --> 03:03:24,935
MATT: (laughs) You're like two feet. He's about
two and a half.

2436
03:03:24,935 --> 03:03:26,704
LIAM: (high-pitched) These are still sharp.

2437
03:03:26,704 --> 03:03:29,110
SAM: You're so cute!

2438
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:30,416
LIAM: (high-pitched) Heeheehee.

2439
03:03:30,416 --> 03:03:33,473
SAM: My turn?

2440
03:03:33,473 --> 03:03:37,962
MATT: So, it's your turn, Scanlan. Oh no, Pike,
Vax, Keyleth, then it's you. Keyleth, what are you doing?

2441
03:03:37,962 --> 03:03:44,505
MARISHA: Oh dear god. Okay. I'm going to transmute
the earth underneath him. Right? That's what I'm

2442
03:03:44,505 --> 03:03:51,874
doing? That's part of the plan? So if I can do
right underneath Umbrasyl, that would be

2443
03:03:51,874 --> 03:03:53,213
fabulous.

2444
03:03:53,213 --> 03:03:57,305
MATT: Transmute Rock--

2445
03:03:57,305 --> 03:03:59,060
MARISHA: It's a 120-foot range.

2446
03:03:59,060 --> 03:04:07,704
MATT: Yes, and a 40-foot cube in the range. So
what are you doing?

2447
03:04:07,704 --> 03:04:16,237
MARISHA: I want to do the area just directly under
Umbrasyl, if I can, so that I'm not sinking the

2448
03:04:16,237 --> 03:04:18,050
Herd around him.

2449
03:04:18,050 --> 03:04:19,927
MATT: Turning what into what?

2450
03:04:19,927 --> 03:04:24,905
MARISHA: I want to turn the ground directly
underneath Umbrasyl into mud.

2451
03:04:24,905 --> 03:04:34,776
MATT: Okay. The only piece of rock is the piece of
rock that you put beneath where the chains were

2452
03:04:34,776 --> 03:04:39,143
there. The area right beneath Umbrasyl is dirt,
it's earth.

2453
03:04:39,143 --> 03:04:47,452
MARISHA: Okay, I thought it had spread, because
it's 40-foot, so I thought it was under Umbrasyl,

2454
03:04:47,452 --> 03:04:49,601
but I could do something else--

2455
03:04:49,601 --> 03:04:54,641
MATT: A 40-foot cube, part of it would be under
Umbrasyl, possibly, but for the placement of where

2456
03:04:54,641 --> 03:05:00,312
you put that, it's going to be hard for you to do
it without it pulling everybody else into it.

2457
03:05:00,312 --> 03:05:03,662
MARISHA: Okay. Plan B.

2458
03:05:03,662 --> 03:05:06,844
MATT: You can do it still, but it'll probably take
some of the Herd with it.

2459
03:05:06,844 --> 03:05:10,261
MARISHA: Should I go with pillars? Yeah. I'll go
with--

2460
03:05:10,261 --> 03:05:11,477
SAM: No.

2461
03:05:11,477 --> 03:05:12,862
MARISHA: No?

2462
03:05:12,862 --> 03:05:16,216
LIAM: Just do what you're going to do. Ignore the
gnome. Go.

2463
03:05:16,216 --> 03:05:23,463
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Bones of the
Earth, which I think I can pop up six pillars

2464
03:05:23,463 --> 03:05:26,233
around Umbrasyl.

2465
03:05:26,233 --> 03:05:28,189
MATT: Okay.

2466
03:05:28,189 --> 03:05:39,138
MARISHA: So, Grog, you want a boost? You want to
stand on a rock?

2467
03:05:39,138 --> 03:05:41,103
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2468
03:05:41,103 --> 03:05:44,989
MARISHA: Pike, you want a boost? Do you want a
boost?

2469
03:05:44,989 --> 03:05:46,866
ASHLEY: Yes.

2470
03:05:46,866 --> 03:05:59,420
MARISHA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I want
a pillar here, Grog. When you're ready.

2471
03:05:59,420 --> 03:06:03,329
MATT: All right, so you're putting Grog on a
pillar.

2472
03:06:03,329 --> 03:06:08,474
MARISHA: Grog on a big stone pillar, bam! And
then, where's the button? Pike on a pillar over

2473
03:06:08,474 --> 03:06:17,823
here, bam. Let's go ahead, I'm trying to trap him
in here. I want to pin him as these go up, so

2474
03:06:17,823 --> 03:06:20,754
let's do one here. Can I get whoever that is up on
a--

2475
03:06:20,754 --> 03:06:22,274
MATT: Which one?

2476
03:06:22,274 --> 03:06:23,684
MARISHA: Right up here.

2477
03:06:23,684 --> 03:06:28,872
MATT: All right. If I'd known you were going to
use this spell, I would've brought the pillars.

2478
03:06:28,872 --> 03:06:37,702
MARISHA: Oh. Surprise! We were trying not to tell
anyone our plan.

2479
03:06:37,702 --> 03:06:40,027
MATT: I know, it's good. Now I know.

2480
03:06:40,027 --> 03:06:42,210
LIAM: We wanted to keep you off-balance, Matt.

2481
03:06:42,210 --> 03:06:44,084
MATT: That's good. All right.

2482
03:06:44,084 --> 03:06:52,987
MARISHA: Let's do another one over here. Bam.
Pinning him in. One, two, what is that, three,

2483
03:06:52,987 --> 03:06:59,158
four. One on the opposite side, over here.
Umbrasyl's a big fatty so I can't get my laser

2484
03:06:59,158 --> 03:07:01,171
pointer over there.

2485
03:07:01,171 --> 03:07:02,755
MATT: Where do you want it? Right there?

2486
03:07:02,755 --> 03:07:08,215
MARISHA: Over here-ish. On the other side of this
one. Can I raise a pillar through his wing?

2487
03:07:08,215 --> 03:07:09,975
MATT: Not through his wing, no.

2488
03:07:09,975 --> 03:07:19,029
MARISHA: So flanking this pillar on the other side
over there, if that makes-- flanking this pillar.

2489
03:07:19,029 --> 03:07:22,801
So wait, move that one that you just placed over a
bit.

2490
03:07:22,801 --> 03:07:25,367
MATT: This is like a summoning spell.

2491
03:07:25,367 --> 03:07:29,071
MARISHA: You know, it's fine. You get the idea.

2492
03:07:29,071 --> 03:07:30,372
MATT: That one there.

2493
03:07:30,372 --> 03:07:31,818
MARISHA: Let's do one up here.

2494
03:07:31,818 --> 03:07:33,195
MATT: You have one more.

2495
03:07:33,195 --> 03:07:34,684
MARISHA: Knock him in the chin.

2496
03:07:34,684 --> 03:07:36,218
MATT: Okay.

2497
03:07:36,218 --> 03:07:39,400
MARISHA: Hopefully that contains him a bit.

2498
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:42,687
MATT: All righty. That finish your turn?

2499
03:07:42,687 --> 03:07:44,229
MARISHA: Yeah, guess so.

2500
03:07:44,229 --> 03:07:47,275
MATT: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.

2501
03:07:47,275 --> 03:07:49,536
SAM: Okay. Here we go.

2502
03:07:49,536 --> 03:07:51,481
LIAM: Here we go.

2503
03:07:51,481 --> 03:07:54,408
SAM: I turn to my little buddy and I say: are you
ready for a ride, little man?

2504
03:07:54,408 --> 03:07:56,090
LIAM: (high-pitched) Come on, big guy!

2505
03:07:56,090 --> 03:08:06,810
SAM: Before we go, I yell as loud as I can to Pike
to inspire her with my bonus action first.

2506
03:08:06,810 --> 03:08:09,375
MATT: The range? Pike is quite far away.

2507
03:08:09,375 --> 03:08:10,788
SAM: Can't hear me, or it won't work?

2508
03:08:10,788 --> 03:08:13,451
MATT: What's the range, I think it's 60 feet, so
yeah. She's too far away.

2509
03:08:13,451 --> 03:08:14,843
MARISHA: I'm behind you.

2510
03:08:14,843 --> 03:08:16,297
SAM: Well then, am I within 60 feet of her?

2511
03:08:16,297 --> 03:08:17,541
MATT: Yeah.

2512
03:08:17,541 --> 03:08:26,039
SAM: Oh. Then I will sing her some inspiration and
I'll sing. (singing) Westruun town a dead-end

2513
03:08:26,039 --> 03:08:33,042
world, east-end boys and Westruun girls, Westruun
girls.

2514
03:08:33,042 --> 03:08:40,457
(laughter)

2515
03:08:40,457 --> 03:08:42,911
MATT: Take your d10.

2516
03:08:42,911 --> 03:08:44,953
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, d10.

2517
03:08:44,953 --> 03:08:52,625
SAM: And then I sort of link arms with good old
Vax. Actually, I hug him tight because we've gotta

2518
03:08:52,625 --> 03:08:59,840
be tight together to do this, and I hold up my
hand cone and I cast Dimension Door and I'm going

2519
03:08:59,840 --> 03:09:02,130
to aim right for the belly of the beast.

2520
03:09:02,130 --> 03:09:04,694
LIAM: And I say: This is so fuuuu--

2521
03:09:04,694 --> 03:09:14,820
MATT: Scanlan. You are not fully familiar with the
physiology of a dragon.

2522
03:09:14,820 --> 03:09:15,942
SAM: No, I am not.

2523
03:09:15,942 --> 03:09:17,220
LAURA: I gave him as much information as I could.

2524
03:09:17,220 --> 03:09:21,516
MATT: And you did. I would like for you to make an
intelligence check.

2525
03:09:21,516 --> 03:09:23,439
SAM: Just an intelligence check.

2526
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:28,304
MATT: This is your ability to ascertain based on
what you've seen, your knowledge of the dragon,

2527
03:09:28,304 --> 03:09:33,619
where possibly in its body its stomach may be.

2528
03:09:33,619 --> 03:09:36,576
SAM: Okay. Why not?

2529
03:09:36,576 --> 03:09:39,173
LAURA: Is it advantage because I told him where it
would be?

2530
03:09:39,173 --> 03:09:44,101
SAM: Nope. 12?

2531
03:09:44,101 --> 03:09:49,308
LIAM: Can I give him my Luck?

2532
03:09:49,308 --> 03:09:51,146
MATT: (laughs) No.

2533
03:09:51,146 --> 03:09:53,955
SAM: It's just intelligence, right, there's no
other--

2534
03:09:53,955 --> 03:09:55,893
MATT: Right, you add your intelligence modifier to
it.

2535
03:09:55,893 --> 03:09:57,698
SAM: Yeah, it's two.

2536
03:09:57,698 --> 03:10:04,275
MATT: You would add two to that because of your
bardic ability. Plus two to any skill check.

2537
03:10:04,275 --> 03:10:05,904
SAM: Okay, 14, then.

2538
03:10:05,904 --> 03:10:07,911
ASHLEY: Is there anything extra from heroes'
feast? No?

2539
03:10:07,911 --> 03:10:20,199
MATT: No. So. Both of you grab hands and vanish.
The darkness that hits your eyes upon vanishing

2540
03:10:20,199 --> 03:10:28,179
doesn't go away as darkness still hits you. All of
a sudden, you are plunged into a thick, wet,

2541
03:10:28,179 --> 03:10:38,750
crushing interior. You have finished your
Dimension Door spell. You are in darkness. You are

2542
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:43,437
being crushed between what feels like two layers
of musculature. Both of you.

2543
03:10:43,437 --> 03:10:46,365
SAM: Hi, dude.

2544
03:10:46,365 --> 03:10:50,799
MATT: You don't know where each other are. You
don't see the other person. There's no sight. You

2545
03:10:50,799 --> 03:10:54,146
can't hear anything.

2546
03:10:54,146 --> 03:10:56,048
SAM: Are we touching at all?

2547
03:10:56,048 --> 03:11:01,836
MATT: Nope. The trajectory of the spell and the
unfortunate circumstance put you guys on two

2548
03:11:01,836 --> 03:11:04,501
different sides of a membrane, and you don't know
where you are.

2549
03:11:04,501 --> 03:11:06,994
SAM: It's going great.

2550
03:11:06,994 --> 03:11:12,296
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?

2551
03:11:12,296 --> 03:11:16,458
SAM: Yeah, that's all-- I'll use my movement to
go--

2552
03:11:16,458 --> 03:11:26,309
MATT: You are both considered restrained, so your
speed becomes zero, attack rolls against you have

2553
03:11:26,309 --> 03:11:33,889
advantage, you have disadvantage on dexterity
saving throws. Also, you suffer eight points of

2554
03:11:33,889 --> 03:11:35,944
acid damage, reduced to four.

2555
03:11:35,944 --> 03:11:37,684
SAM: Awesome.

2556
03:11:37,684 --> 03:11:41,369
LIAM: Who's got the other gatestone? I have one.

2557
03:11:41,369 --> 03:11:42,999
ASHLEY: Oh, I have one.

2558
03:11:42,999 --> 03:11:44,973
LIAM: 60 seconds.

2559
03:11:44,973 --> 03:11:53,408
MATT: You also both currently have no air. At the
top of this round, Umbrasyl goes (disgruntled noises).

2560
03:11:53,408 --> 03:11:56,161
LIAM: Suck it, bitch!

2561
03:11:56,161 --> 03:12:01,560
MATT: "I will eat all of you!"

2562
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:04,453
LIAM: I'm a two-foot-tall rogue, you
motherfucker.

2563
03:12:04,453 --> 03:12:05,831
LAURA: I'm up?

2564
03:12:05,831 --> 03:12:07,597
MATT: You're up first, top of the round.

2565
03:12:07,597 --> 03:12:26,016
LAURA: Oh my god. Okay, I'm going to cast Conjure
Animals and I'm going to conjure two giant eagles

2566
03:12:26,016 --> 03:12:36,050
right in front of his face.

2567
03:12:36,050 --> 03:12:38,914
MATT: I'm really hoping we can put more things on
the battlefield, guys. I think that would be a

2568
03:12:38,914 --> 03:12:40,059
cool idea.

2569
03:12:40,059 --> 03:12:41,360
LAURA: (laughs) Sorry, Matt.

2570
03:12:41,360 --> 03:12:43,404
MATT: It's not like I don't have enough to
concentrate on up there.

2571
03:12:43,404 --> 03:12:45,103
LAURA: I'm sorry.

2572
03:12:45,103 --> 03:12:51,611
MATT: It's fine. I don't have two giant eagle
miniatures, so we'll say, for the time being, this

2573
03:12:51,611 --> 03:12:53,198
air elemental is a giant eagle.

2574
03:12:53,198 --> 03:12:54,475
LAURA: Okay.

2575
03:12:54,475 --> 03:12:56,876
LIAM: I'll say, with no facetiousness, this is all
I ever wanted in my life.

2576
03:12:56,876 --> 03:12:59,342
SAM: To be trapped in the spleen of a dragon
with me?

2577
03:12:59,342 --> 03:13:01,043
MATT: We'll say these are up in the air.

2578
03:13:01,043 --> 03:13:02,742
LAURA: Okay, right in front of--

2579
03:13:02,742 --> 03:13:04,629
MATT: Because I've used all the height things
for--

2580
03:13:04,629 --> 03:13:11,415
LAURA: And Conjure Animals is an action, or a--

2581
03:13:11,415 --> 03:13:12,779
MATT: It's an action.

2582
03:13:12,779 --> 03:13:18,823
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tell them to attack his
eyes.

2583
03:13:18,823 --> 03:13:20,405
MATT: Okay.

2584
03:13:20,405 --> 03:13:22,278
LAURA: They get their own--

2585
03:13:22,278 --> 03:13:27,111
MATT: Own initiative, which I just rolled. What's
their dexterity bonus?

2586
03:13:27,111 --> 03:13:42,016
LAURA: You sent me a thing-- let's go with that.
Hold up. Giant eagle, dexterity is 17, plus three.

2587
03:13:42,016 --> 03:13:50,578
MATT: So it would be plus three, that puts them at
11, so they are just above Keyleth and Vax. All right.

2588
03:13:50,578 --> 03:14:03,868
LAURA: And then for my bonus action, I'm going
to-- I can't cast two spells, even if one's a

2589
03:14:03,868 --> 03:14:05,505
bonus action?

2590
03:14:05,505 --> 03:14:07,392
MATT: As long as it's a level two or lower.

2591
03:14:07,392 --> 03:14:16,004
LAURA: Oh, okay. For my bonus action, I'm going to
hide a lot? I'm going to hide.

2592
03:14:16,004 --> 03:14:20,282
MATT: You didn't start the round hidden, so you
can't do that.

2593
03:14:20,282 --> 03:14:22,328
LAURA: I wasn't still hidden?

2594
03:14:22,328 --> 03:14:25,515
MATT: No, you have to spend a bonus action to
attempt to hide at the end of your turn.

2595
03:14:25,515 --> 03:14:27,922
LAURA: Can I attempt to hide?

2596
03:14:27,922 --> 03:14:34,197
MATT: You'd have to be a level two rogue to do
that as a bonus action on your turn.

2597
03:14:34,197 --> 03:14:39,213
LAURA: But on my boots of haste I can use it to
dash, disengage, or hide.

2598
03:14:39,213 --> 03:14:42,507
MATT: Oh, you're using your bonus action-- so your
extra action, not your bonus action.

2599
03:14:42,507 --> 03:14:43,708
LAURA: Okay, my extra action.

2600
03:14:43,708 --> 03:14:45,784
MATT: You can do that, yes. Go ahead and roll a
stealth check.

2601
03:14:45,784 --> 03:14:53,268
LAURA: Natural 20.

2602
03:14:53,268 --> 03:14:56,238
MATT: You vanish into the foliage.

2603
03:14:56,238 --> 03:14:58,743
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2604
03:14:58,743 --> 03:15:09,900
MATT: All right. Great. Finishing your turn, the
Herd now goes. They're going to attempt to put the

2605
03:15:09,900 --> 03:15:29,781
rest of the chains up to increase the DC of the
grapple. There we go. So four more chains get

2606
03:15:29,781 --> 03:15:39,084
latched on so they're holding. Each chain
increases the DC of the grapple. All right. So as

2607
03:15:39,084 --> 03:15:43,373
they're all holding it down, the five in the back
that are going to take attacks on it are going to

2608
03:15:43,373 --> 03:16:03,634
do so. That's a hit, miss, miss, hit, miss, miss,
miss, miss, miss, hit. Three hits. So four damage,

2609
03:16:03,634 --> 03:16:10,309
five damage, and eight damage.

2610
03:16:10,309 --> 03:16:13,607
LAURA: Wow, these guys hit real hard. How come
they were hitting us so hard?

2611
03:16:13,607 --> 03:16:21,250
MATT: They're rolling really terrible. They get
two attacks each. All right. And with that, the

2612
03:16:21,250 --> 03:16:36,705
tribal druid is going to cast Blight on the
creature. However, it does make its saving throw,

2613
03:16:36,705 --> 03:16:51,713
so for the purposes of speed on this I'm going to
use my dice-rolling app. That's a lot of dice to

2614
03:16:51,713 --> 03:17:01,795
roll. That comes to 18 points of necrotic damage.
That brings us to the end of that round. Grog,

2615
03:17:01,795 --> 03:17:03,227
you're up.

2616
03:17:03,227 --> 03:17:07,001
TRAVIS: Could I go into a frenzied rage?

2617
03:17:07,001 --> 03:17:08,403
MATT: You may.

2618
03:17:08,403 --> 03:17:13,712
TRAVIS: Excellent. I'm on top of a pillar, and I'm
not within striking distance, right?

2619
03:17:13,712 --> 03:17:15,618
MATT: You can hit it.

2620
03:17:15,618 --> 03:17:16,847
TRAVIS: From up there?

2621
03:17:16,847 --> 03:17:18,165
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty tall.

2622
03:17:18,165 --> 03:17:25,619
TRAVIS: (laughs) I would like to use all three of
my attacks against his backside, reckless.

2623
03:17:25,619 --> 03:17:30,097
MATT: Okay.

2624
03:17:30,097 --> 03:17:31,651
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2625
03:17:31,651 --> 03:17:33,290
MATT: All righty.

2626
03:17:33,290 --> 03:17:38,060
TRAVIS: 26.

2627
03:17:38,060 --> 03:17:39,568
MATT: Hits.

2628
03:17:39,568 --> 03:17:43,860
TRAVIS: These are just regular. They're not great
weapon master. 23.

2629
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:45,029
MATT: Hits.

2630
03:17:45,029 --> 03:17:47,472
TRAVIS: Sweet. So the first one was the crit.

2631
03:17:47,472 --> 03:17:50,909
MATT: The crit. So go ahead and roll damage on
that plus two additional d12s.

2632
03:17:50,909 --> 03:18:04,250
TRAVIS: Right. That's a d12. 21 and two additional
d12s?

2633
03:18:04,250 --> 03:18:06,607
MATT: Yep, 21 plus?

2634
03:18:06,607 --> 03:18:07,714
TRAVIS: Ten, 31.

2635
03:18:07,714 --> 03:18:08,837
MATT: 31.

2636
03:18:08,837 --> 03:18:10,529
TRAVIS: Seven, so 38.

2637
03:18:10,529 --> 03:18:15,361
MATT: 38 points of damage on the first strike.
Next two strikes, roll for it.

2638
03:18:15,361 --> 03:18:19,393
TRAVIS: That was awful. 13.

2639
03:18:19,393 --> 03:18:21,214
MATT: 13, all right. Last one.

2640
03:18:21,214 --> 03:18:25,829
TRAVIS: That was also pretty crap. That's 16.

2641
03:18:25,829 --> 03:18:31,901
MATT: 16, okay. At the end of its turn it's going
to use a legendary action to attempt to wing

2642
03:18:31,901 --> 03:18:33,718
attack you. It's going to cost its last--

2643
03:18:33,718 --> 03:18:36,038
TRAVIS: Oh, I did not add the necrotic.

2644
03:18:36,038 --> 03:18:37,777
MATT: Go for it.

2645
03:18:37,777 --> 03:18:42,329
TRAVIS: On all three of them. Three, six, eight.

2646
03:18:42,329 --> 03:18:44,849
MATT: Total of eight?

2647
03:18:44,849 --> 03:18:45,993
TRAVIS: Total of eight.

2648
03:18:45,993 --> 03:18:52,290
MATT: All right. Expending two of its actions to
use a wing attack, it's going to go ahead and

2649
03:18:52,290 --> 03:18:58,633
start beating its wings as hard as it can, even
with the chains amongst it. Each creature within

2650
03:18:58,633 --> 03:19:04,025
50 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23
dexterity saving throw. Make a dex save.

2651
03:19:04,025 --> 03:19:08,898
TRAVIS: (singing) I believe I can fly--

2652
03:19:08,898 --> 03:19:12,754
MATT: The only one of the party within-- what did
you roll?

2653
03:19:12,754 --> 03:19:14,416
TRAVIS: A nine.

2654
03:19:14,416 --> 03:19:18,909
MATT: Nine. All right. You take 15 points of
bludgeoning damage.

2655
03:19:18,909 --> 03:19:20,751
TRAVIS: Reduced to...

2656
03:19:20,751 --> 03:19:32,594
MATT: Reduced to eight. Go ahead and make one more
dexterity saving throw, just for my own sake.

2657
03:19:32,594 --> 03:19:36,999
TRAVIS: 16.

2658
03:19:36,999 --> 03:19:43,024
MATT: 16. You are thrust off the pillar, pushed,
falling, and hitting the ground, prone on the

2659
03:19:43,024 --> 03:19:50,246
ground, the pillar remains there. You take an
additional eight points of bludgeoning damage,

2660
03:19:50,246 --> 03:19:55,588
reduced to four, from the impact. But you are
knocked prone. The rest of the Herd here, we'll

2661
03:19:55,588 --> 03:20:03,483
say for the sake of that, they do not save. Oh,
man. They are all knocked prone, knocking much of

2662
03:20:03,483 --> 03:20:14,363
the chains free from their hands as they're thrown onto
their backs. Then it is still technically

2663
03:20:14,363 --> 03:20:19,577
grappled, so it cannot fly half its speed,
unfortunately. It does seem to have knocked a

2664
03:20:19,577 --> 03:20:23,600
majority of the chains off its back. Percy, you're
up.

2665
03:20:23,600 --> 03:20:26,597
TALIESIN: Holding my action until its action.

2666
03:20:26,597 --> 03:20:44,911
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Noja. Noja's going
to attempt another Lightning Bolt. It's the best

2667
03:20:44,911 --> 03:21:03,999
thing he has at the moment. Oh, a natural 20 on
the saving throw. Nope. Not bad. 15 points of

2668
03:21:03,999 --> 03:21:12,677
lightning damage to Umbrasyl. Noja's then going to
dart back behind the tree. Ending Noja's turn, it

2669
03:21:12,677 --> 03:21:22,976
is now Umbrasyl's turn. Umbrasyl is going to go
ahead and attempt to break free of the final

2670
03:21:22,976 --> 03:21:24,783
chains that are there.

2671
03:21:24,783 --> 03:21:26,148
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

2672
03:21:26,148 --> 03:21:33,243
MATT: Correct, with disadvantage. But even so
comes out to a 22. (crash) The rest of the chains

2673
03:21:33,243 --> 03:21:35,549
that were holding Umbrasyl down break free.

2674
03:21:35,549 --> 03:21:38,581
LAURA: What about the trap? Is he out of the trap
then, too?

2675
03:21:38,581 --> 03:21:45,079
MATT: Well, the trap that's currently holding it
in place is part of the whole setup. The trap is

2676
03:21:45,079 --> 03:21:49,137
what's keeping it there, starting the grapple, and
the chains are just there to increase the DC. So

2677
03:21:49,137 --> 03:21:54,919
with that, the actual metal structure of the trap
that held it in place is shattered. You can see

2678
03:21:54,919 --> 03:21:59,791
pieces of iron go flying, wood splintering in this
cloud of dust that is kicked up from the movement

2679
03:21:59,791 --> 03:22:05,783
of the wings. Currently right now there are still
hooks and chains dangling from Umbrasyl, but some

2680
03:22:05,783 --> 03:22:12,122
of them have broken and most of them are unmanned
at the moment. The dragon is going to

2681
03:22:12,122 --> 03:22:15,373
(wings flapping) go ahead and--

2682
03:22:15,373 --> 03:22:16,962
TALIESIN: Can I take my action?

2683
03:22:16,962 --> 03:22:18,218
MATT: You can, yes.

2684
03:22:18,218 --> 03:22:23,087
TALIESIN: I'm taking a shot at him at the joint at
his wing and I'm going to attempt to ground him.

2685
03:22:23,087 --> 03:22:26,514
MATT: Attempt to ground him? Okay, go for it. Roll
for the attack.

2686
03:22:26,514 --> 03:22:32,095
TALIESIN: Natural fucking 20.

2687
03:22:32,095 --> 03:22:34,804
(cheering)

2688
03:22:34,804 --> 03:22:36,764
TALIESIN: Oh no, oh my god, right now.

2689
03:22:36,764 --> 03:22:38,197
MARISHA: He's taking a photo?

2690
03:22:38,197 --> 03:22:40,617
TRAVIS: He's taking a photo.

2691
03:22:40,617 --> 03:22:52,176
TALIESIN: Photo taken. Ha! Natural 20. It still
doesn't necessarily mean he's grounded. It means

2692
03:22:52,176 --> 03:22:55,538
he has to make a strength saving throw or he's
prone.

2693
03:22:55,538 --> 03:22:58,073
MATT: Correct. So roll the damage first.

2694
03:22:58,073 --> 03:23:15,352
TALIESIN: Roll damage. Oh yeah. That's double
dice, so that's-- 23 points doubled is 46 plus--

2695
03:23:15,352 --> 03:23:18,760
MATT: Plus the modifier. So 46 is--

2696
03:23:18,760 --> 03:23:27,360
TALIESIN: 46, yeah, plus the modifier now is 52
points of damage total.

2697
03:23:27,360 --> 03:23:30,726
LIAM: That bullet came from the center of the
Pacific Ocean!

2698
03:23:30,726 --> 03:23:33,043
MATT: Strength saving throw.

2699
03:23:33,043 --> 03:23:35,380
TALIESIN: I rolled really well.

2700
03:23:35,380 --> 03:23:42,892
MATT: That's amazing. All right, so. Strength
saving throw to try and resist the effect. That is

2701
03:23:42,892 --> 03:23:46,698
a failure. It's going to use one of its legendary
actions to automatically succeed, one of its

2702
03:23:46,698 --> 03:23:53,835
legendary resistances. So succeeds. Rising up from
the ground, because of all the guys that are

2703
03:23:53,835 --> 03:23:54,955
knocked prone--

2704
03:23:54,955 --> 03:23:56,129
TALIESIN: Wait!

2705
03:23:56,129 --> 03:23:57,958
MATT: What was that?

2706
03:23:57,958 --> 03:24:01,312
TALIESIN: I was going to pop off a couple more
shots.

2707
03:24:01,312 --> 03:24:06,940
MATT: You held your action, okay. So you fired,
loaded, fired last round.

2708
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:09,666
TALIESIN: I was going to blow an action surge.

2709
03:24:09,666 --> 03:24:16,427
MATT: Oh. It's weird to do-- Out of turn action,
it is a little strange to do that.

2710
03:24:16,427 --> 03:24:18,092
TALIESIN: Okay.

2711
03:24:18,092 --> 03:24:25,217
MATT: He held his action. That's something you do
on your turn as a burst. I'll say, probably have

2712
03:24:25,217 --> 03:24:27,019
to wait on your actual turn to do that full bit.

2713
03:24:27,019 --> 03:24:28,935
TALIESIN: No, it's okay. Go ahead.

2714
03:24:28,935 --> 03:24:33,249
MATT: Umbrasyl does rise up about 40 feet.

2715
03:24:33,249 --> 03:24:34,749
LIAM: Here we go, Scanlan.

2716
03:24:34,749 --> 03:24:37,316
MATT: It's actually going to move back this way.

2717
03:24:37,316 --> 03:24:40,811
ASHLEY: Did he never land on the glyph?

2718
03:24:40,811 --> 03:24:48,207
MATT: He landed in the trap immediately and the
trap set off, but he never grabbed the stuff.

2719
03:24:48,207 --> 03:24:50,379
ASHLEY: It was if he landed on it.

2720
03:24:50,379 --> 03:24:51,989
MATT: You said it was to--

2721
03:24:51,989 --> 03:24:53,687
LIAM: Pull it off.

2722
03:24:53,687 --> 03:24:55,192
TRAVIS: Yeah, we said to lift it off.

2723
03:24:55,192 --> 03:25:07,918
MATT: All right. Flying back at that point
(flapping wings) just growling, absolute anger.

2724
03:25:07,918 --> 03:25:14,805
Squeezed in its insides, you guys both feel this
heavy contraction within its body as you guys

2725
03:25:14,805 --> 03:25:22,223
watch this flow of greenish bile spittle begins to
fill up and spray out in a line from its mouth.

2726
03:25:22,223 --> 03:25:26,794
LIAM: Look at all those people.

2727
03:25:26,794 --> 03:25:28,625
LAURA: Are they all going to die?

2728
03:25:28,625 --> 03:25:37,496
MATT: Everything there-- Okay.

2729
03:25:37,496 --> 03:25:40,556
LAURA: The birds were up in the air, though.

2730
03:25:40,556 --> 03:25:46,902
MATT: Right, but the stream sprays down, it's not
just a single bolt. It vomits it out and it lands

2731
03:25:46,902 --> 03:25:50,117
over everything. That's how it works.

2732
03:25:50,117 --> 03:25:54,814
SAM: Pike, are you in there?

2733
03:25:54,814 --> 03:25:56,656
TRAVIS: No.

2734
03:25:56,656 --> 03:26:01,906
MATT: All right, that comes to 15d8 acid damage.

2735
03:26:01,906 --> 03:26:04,912
LAURA: 15d8?

2736
03:26:04,912 --> 03:26:10,182
SAM: I think a lot of those people will be fine.

2737
03:26:10,182 --> 03:26:16,728
MATT: So that's 81 points of damage to all those
guys. They all just dissolve in horrible agony.

2738
03:26:16,728 --> 03:26:21,063
LAURA: Oh my god, you guys, we're going to die.

2739
03:26:21,063 --> 03:26:23,063
SAM: No, just me and Liam.

2740
03:26:23,063 --> 03:26:31,438
Both of the eagles just screech in pain as they're
entirely ruined.

2741
03:26:31,438 --> 03:26:36,860
LAURA: Good job, you fucking wastes of space. They
didn't even get to fucking go.

2742
03:26:36,860 --> 03:26:48,805
MATT: Sorry. That's going to end Umbrasyl the
Hope-Devourer's turn.

2743
03:26:48,805 --> 03:26:51,408
MARISHA: The Hope-Devourer?

2744
03:26:51,408 --> 03:26:52,673
MATT: That is the full name.

2745
03:26:52,673 --> 03:26:58,100
SAM: So his middle name is The Hope? And his last
name is Devourer?

2746
03:26:58,100 --> 03:27:00,455
MATT: Devourer. Married into it.

2747
03:27:00,455 --> 03:27:02,340
SAM: It's hyphenated?

2748
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:03,712
MATT: Hyphenated, yeah.

2749
03:27:03,712 --> 03:27:06,691
TRAVIS: Marriage fucked everything up.

2750
03:27:06,691 --> 03:27:11,568
MARISHA: Yep, Umbrasyl the Hope and then marriage
fucked everything up.

2751
03:27:11,568 --> 03:27:17,917
MATT: You guys have both entirely vanished, you
both are inside the entity. All right, so.

2752
03:27:17,917 --> 03:27:24,386
Keyleth, the line just stops right before you. It
smacks into the ground five feet from your feet

2753
03:27:24,386 --> 03:27:29,966
and you watch as the earth and grass beneath you
just immediately turns black and seems to almost

2754
03:27:29,966 --> 03:27:38,275
coalesce into this death-sludge in this long line.
It just barely misses you. All right, that's going

2755
03:27:38,275 --> 03:27:41,018
to end Umbrasyl's turn. Pike, you're up.

2756
03:27:41,018 --> 03:27:52,610
ASHLEY: All right. So. I'm going to Guiding Bolt
him again.

2757
03:27:52,610 --> 03:27:58,614
MATT: All right. You're now up on a pillar facing
this giant flying dragon. Standing above the rest

2758
03:27:58,614 --> 03:28:02,893
of the battlefield, your shield up and your
Frostbrand to the side, you reach up and grab your

2759
03:28:02,893 --> 03:28:06,788
holy symbol and go ahead and roll for your Guiding
Bolt attack.

2760
03:28:06,788 --> 03:28:10,381
TRAVIS: How high is he?

2761
03:28:10,381 --> 03:28:12,229
MATT: 30 feet. He went back.

2762
03:28:12,229 --> 03:28:13,618
ASHLEY: 28?

2763
03:28:13,618 --> 03:28:15,068
MATT: 28 hits.

2764
03:28:15,068 --> 03:28:18,923
TRAVIS: Fuck him up, Pike.

2765
03:28:18,923 --> 03:28:21,719
MARISHA: Come on, Pike. Can you bring him down
any?

2766
03:28:21,719 --> 03:28:24,742
ASHLEY: I'm rolling what again? Sorry.

2767
03:28:24,742 --> 03:28:26,436
LAURA: What level are you casting it at?

2768
03:28:26,436 --> 03:28:28,209
ASHLEY: Four again.

2769
03:28:28,209 --> 03:28:32,466
MATT: How many 4th-level spells do you have left
now? Because you cast--

2770
03:28:32,466 --> 03:28:33,791
ASHLEY: I have two more.

2771
03:28:33,791 --> 03:28:37,845
MATT: Two more? Because you cast Death Ward, which
is 4th-level, I believe, right? On Scanlan?

2772
03:28:37,845 --> 03:28:48,584
LIAM: Well, what did you do? You did Death Ward.
And is that it?

2773
03:28:48,584 --> 03:28:50,086
ASHLEY: The last Guiding Bolt.

2774
03:28:50,086 --> 03:28:51,387
LAURA: Yeah, so that's only two you used.

2775
03:28:51,387 --> 03:28:52,891
MATT: Right. So you have how many more left at
4th-level?

2776
03:28:52,891 --> 03:28:59,514
ASHLEY: Two. Because the ring gives me one extra.

2777
03:28:59,514 --> 03:29:06,669
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll that. That
is going to be 4d-- how much do you get Guiding

2778
03:29:06,669 --> 03:29:08,469
Bolt damage on that then?

2779
03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:10,768
LAURA: 4d6 plus an additional two or three?

2780
03:29:10,768 --> 03:29:15,354
ASHLEY: At fourth level, that would be seven,
then.

2781
03:29:15,354 --> 03:29:17,948
MATT: That would be 7d6 radiant damage.

2782
03:29:17,948 --> 03:29:36,620
ASHLEY: 22.

2783
03:29:36,620 --> 03:29:38,212
MATT: 22 points of damage.

2784
03:29:38,212 --> 03:29:42,117
ASHLEY: But I'll also-- never mind. We're good,
22.

2785
03:29:42,117 --> 03:29:43,303
MATT: You're good. Okay.

2786
03:29:43,303 --> 03:29:47,880
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to move my Spiritual
Weapon.

2787
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:50,625
MATT: Okay, Spiritual Weapon, which is technically
on the ground over here.

2788
03:29:50,625 --> 03:29:54,937
ASHLEY: And I'm going to move it to the back of
his neck.

2789
03:29:54,937 --> 03:29:59,611
MATT: Let's see. Spiritual Weapon, can move it 20
feet and repeat the attack.

2790
03:29:59,611 --> 03:30:01,406
It is more than 20 feet away.

2791
03:30:01,406 --> 03:30:02,616
ASHLEY: Okay.

2792
03:30:02,616 --> 03:30:07,430
MATT: It's down there, so it can begin to shift
upward in that direction. So we'll say that it's

2793
03:30:07,430 --> 03:30:09,139
partway floating in midair.

2794
03:30:09,139 --> 03:30:10,238
ASHLEY: Can it get his feet?

2795
03:30:10,238 --> 03:30:12,090
MATT: No, it can't. It's too far away,
unfortunately.

2796
03:30:12,090 --> 03:30:14,235
ASHLEY: All right, well, it'll start working its
way up there.

2797
03:30:14,235 --> 03:30:19,477
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Pike. All right.
It would be the eagles' turn, but they got

2798
03:30:19,477 --> 03:30:20,689
dissolved.

2799
03:30:20,689 --> 03:30:23,490
LAURA: Thanks, Matt. Thank you for pointing that
back out.

2800
03:30:23,490 --> 03:30:27,642
MATT: Oh, I like to. I also want to point out that
you guys held my dragon to the ground for two

2801
03:30:27,642 --> 03:30:30,144
rounds and hit it like a goddamn pincushion.

2802
03:30:30,144 --> 03:30:34,498
LIAM: You'll feel better once Scanlan and I have
dissolved.

2803
03:30:34,498 --> 03:30:40,146
MATT: I will. All right. End of Pike's turn. Vax,
you're up first. At the top of your round--

2804
03:30:40,146 --> 03:30:48,597
LIAM: I'm just going to take the dragon blade and
I'm going to as best as I can drag it in front of me.

2805
03:30:48,597 --> 03:30:49,697
MATT: Okay.

2806
03:30:49,697 --> 03:30:50,905
LIAM: I'm going to cut the insides of this--

2807
03:30:50,905 --> 03:30:55,584
MATT: First, you take eight points of bludgeoning
damage as it is crushing you, muscles tensing on

2808
03:30:55,584 --> 03:31:00,770
the inside are just-- You're in between
musculature right now and just being crushed.

2809
03:31:00,770 --> 03:31:03,959
LIAM: Yes. Probably its sphincter. Now what?

2810
03:31:03,959 --> 03:31:06,641
MATT: You are restrained, so go ahead and make
your attack at disadvantage.

2811
03:31:06,641 --> 03:31:08,087
LIAM: At disadvantage.

2812
03:31:08,087 --> 03:31:10,199
LAURA: But it can't very well avoid it.

2813
03:31:10,199 --> 03:31:14,750
MATT: It's about him being able to actually move
and get it.

2814
03:31:14,750 --> 03:31:26,315
LIAM: Well, I'm using the dragon longsword, which
I've never used before. It's a plus one sword, so I get what?

2815
03:31:26,315 --> 03:31:28,105
MATT: Plus one to hit.

2816
03:31:28,105 --> 03:31:29,412
LIAM: With strength?

2817
03:31:29,412 --> 03:31:33,507
MATT: It would be strength, but we've agreed that
it can work as finesse for the purposes of a dex

2818
03:31:33,507 --> 03:31:35,132
bonus, you just can't sneak attack.

2819
03:31:35,132 --> 03:31:37,303
LIAM: I just can't sneak attack. All right. So.

2820
03:31:37,303 --> 03:31:38,979
MATT: Be grateful I'm being--

2821
03:31:38,979 --> 03:31:46,988
LIAM: Whatever you want to do, you are the deity
here. So this is a 17 to hit.

2822
03:31:46,988 --> 03:31:51,583
MATT: 17, you pull the blade and it's just unable
to cut through this tense muscle and tendon.

2823
03:31:51,583 --> 03:31:53,261
LIAM: Use Luck.

2824
03:31:53,261 --> 03:31:54,367
MATT: Okay.

2825
03:31:54,367 --> 03:31:55,357
LIAM: Nothing.

2826
03:31:55,357 --> 03:31:57,137
ASHLEY: Wait, what is this? Is this an attack?

2827
03:31:57,137 --> 03:31:58,448
MATT: He's trying from the inside.

2828
03:31:58,448 --> 03:32:00,786
ASHLEY: Can I cast War God's Blessing?

2829
03:32:00,786 --> 03:32:03,380
MATT: Does War God's Blessing require you to see
the creature?

2830
03:32:03,380 --> 03:32:05,176
ASHLEY: Probably not.

2831
03:32:05,176 --> 03:32:06,439
MATT: We'll find out.

2832
03:32:06,439 --> 03:32:07,637
SAM: Yeah, probably.

2833
03:32:07,637 --> 03:32:08,757
TRAVIS: Probably not.

2834
03:32:08,757 --> 03:32:19,127
MATT: When a creature within 30 feet makes an
attack roll-- So, using the Guiding Bolt, you can

2835
03:32:19,127 --> 03:32:28,459
see shifting somewhere in the body of Umbrasyl--
(laughs) You see this form moving in there. You

2836
03:32:28,459 --> 03:32:32,573
know, based on what you guys have discussed
before-- I hope you discussed this plan before.

2837
03:32:32,573 --> 03:32:35,992
LIAM: We discussed it so much.

2838
03:32:35,992 --> 03:32:41,597
MATT: That's a plus ten bonus, is that what it
is?

2839
03:32:41,597 --> 03:32:42,614
ASHLEY: Plus ten.

2840
03:32:42,614 --> 03:32:44,512
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage with the
longsword.

2841
03:32:44,512 --> 03:32:46,255
MARISHA: Is this sneak attack?

2842
03:32:46,255 --> 03:32:48,951
MATT: No, he doesn't get sneak attack with a long
blade.

2843
03:32:48,951 --> 03:32:55,336
TRAVIS: But against dragons it does specific
damage.

2844
03:32:55,336 --> 03:32:58,445
LIAM: Yeah, it does plus 3d6, if I remember.

2845
03:32:58,445 --> 03:33:02,259
MATT: Let me look it up here just to be safe.

2846
03:33:02,259 --> 03:33:06,807
LIAM: 15 from the inside.

2847
03:33:06,807 --> 03:33:08,356
MATT: 15 damage from the inside.

2848
03:33:08,356 --> 03:33:14,560
LIAM: Hopefully that cuts me a little breathing
room. And a question that only you know,

2849
03:33:14,560 --> 03:33:15,906
Matthew--

2850
03:33:15,906 --> 03:33:17,567
MATT: The extra is 3d6, you are correct.

2851
03:33:17,567 --> 03:33:19,561
LIAM: Am I within five feet of Scanlan?

2852
03:33:19,561 --> 03:33:21,262
TALIESIN: An <i>extra</i> 3d6, not just 3d6.

2853
03:33:21,262 --> 03:33:31,517
LIAM: I got 15 damage. Am I within, I'd like to
use my bonus action to sneak attack if I can, if

2854
03:33:31,517 --> 03:33:37,721
I'm within five feet. If Scanlan is within five
feet of the creature, that's up to you. I don't

2855
03:33:37,721 --> 03:33:39,503
know. It's crazy circumstance.

2856
03:33:39,503 --> 03:33:43,807
MATT: The reason that you would get sneak attack
for having another creature within five feet is

2857
03:33:43,807 --> 03:33:46,221
because it is harrying and the opponent is
distracted--

2858
03:33:46,221 --> 03:33:48,262
LIAM: The heartburn is not distracting it?

2859
03:33:48,262 --> 03:33:49,555
MATT: Not enough.

2860
03:33:49,555 --> 03:33:50,774
LIAM: Not enough. Okay.

2861
03:33:50,774 --> 03:33:55,828
MATT: There's not a lot of threat to Umbrasyl.

2862
03:33:55,828 --> 03:33:57,766
LAURA: You get a d8 plus your d6.

2863
03:33:57,766 --> 03:33:59,050
LIAM: Yes, I know. I did it.

2864
03:33:59,050 --> 03:34:00,359
LAURA: Then you did the additional 3d6?

2865
03:34:00,359 --> 03:34:01,555
LIAM: I did, darling.

2866
03:34:01,555 --> 03:34:02,609
LAURA: And you only got 15?

2867
03:34:02,609 --> 03:34:05,466
LIAM: I only got 15. I would like to use the
dagger to cut into him as well.

2868
03:34:05,466 --> 03:34:07,498
MATT: All right, go for it. Disadvantage on that
attack.

2869
03:34:07,498 --> 03:34:09,058
LIAM: Disadvantage?

2870
03:34:09,058 --> 03:34:10,213
MATT: Yes.

2871
03:34:10,213 --> 03:34:15,913
LIAM: Oh, that's no good. That's, nah, it's 12.

2872
03:34:15,913 --> 03:34:21,767
MATT: You can't even get your dagger out of the
sheath. It's too tight in there. You are cutting

2873
03:34:21,767 --> 03:34:26,303
through muscle, and you feel the body and the
muscle just tense based on the reaction of the

2874
03:34:26,303 --> 03:34:31,010
interior pain. You watch the dragon, but
it's still keeping up in the air.

2875
03:34:31,010 --> 03:34:32,495
LIAM: I'm okay. Okay.

2876
03:34:32,495 --> 03:34:34,208
MATT: You are beginning to suffocate.

2877
03:34:34,208 --> 03:34:35,142
LIAM: All right.

2878
03:34:35,142 --> 03:34:36,400
SAM: Oh, jesus.

2879
03:34:36,400 --> 03:34:38,876
MATT: I mean, you can hold your breath for a
little while here, but just letting you know,

2880
03:34:38,876 --> 03:34:42,510
there is no airflow. You're not suffocating yet,
but you know there is no air to breathe

2881
03:34:42,510 --> 03:34:43,503
currently.

2882
03:34:43,503 --> 03:34:45,556
LIAM: I understand, Matthew. I'm fucked. It's
fine.

2883
03:34:45,556 --> 03:34:48,717
MATT: All right. That's your turn. That brings us
to Keyleth.

2884
03:34:48,717 --> 03:35:04,252
MARISHA: I'm so scared. Okay, hang on. What the
hell is the range on that? I'm going to just take

2885
03:35:04,252 --> 03:35:09,084
a few steps forward, here-ish. Matt.

2886
03:35:09,084 --> 03:35:10,440
MATT: Right there?

2887
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:14,755
MARISHA: There-ish, move up a little bit. Just so
I can-- Yeah, just ahead of the tree. And I'm

2888
03:35:14,755 --> 03:35:21,530
going to attempt to cast Earthbind on him. He has
to make a strength saving throw.

2889
03:35:21,530 --> 03:35:29,706
MATT: Strength saving throw. That is a failure.
It's going to use its second legendary resistance,

2890
03:35:29,706 --> 03:35:31,240
succeeds.

2891
03:35:31,240 --> 03:35:35,034
MARISHA: Fuck, I knew it. Well, we've burned off
two of his legendary resistances.

2892
03:35:35,034 --> 03:35:40,865
LIAM: Also, I have no idea what the initiative
order is, but Fassbender keeps doing Slow until I

2893
03:35:40,865 --> 03:35:42,386
tell him to do something else, right?

2894
03:35:42,386 --> 03:35:44,541
MATT: If it recharges. Go ahead and roll a d6.

2895
03:35:44,541 --> 03:35:45,964
LIAM: A d6.

2896
03:35:45,964 --> 03:35:47,142
MATT: Yes.

2897
03:35:47,142 --> 03:35:48,161
LIAM: Two.

2898
03:35:48,161 --> 03:35:51,759
MATT: Two. It does not recharge Slow. Fassbender
is too low. Fassbender is just standing there now.

2899
03:35:51,759 --> 03:36:00,404
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to take the remaining of
my turn. Oh shit, I actually didn't want to move.

2900
03:36:00,404 --> 03:36:03,908
It's okay. I'm going to turn into an earth
elemental.

2901
03:36:03,908 --> 03:36:16,222
MATT: Okay. All right.

2902
03:36:16,222 --> 03:36:20,393
MARISHA: And I'm going to take the remaining of my
movement to move up--

2903
03:36:20,393 --> 03:36:22,592
MATT: Up?

2904
03:36:22,592 --> 03:36:28,612
MARISHA: Well, he has 60 feet of movement, but I
moved, what, like ten feet earlier, so.

2905
03:36:28,612 --> 03:36:31,011
MATT: 60 feet of movement? His speed is 60?

2906
03:36:31,011 --> 03:36:41,915
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry. His Earthglide is-- Yes,
30, so he moves up 20 feet.

2907
03:36:41,915 --> 03:36:48,144
MATT: 20 feet, all right. That finishes your turn,
Keyleth. Scanlan, you're up. Actually, at the end

2908
03:36:48,144 --> 03:36:54,141
of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use a legendary
action to use a tail attack against you, Pike,

2909
03:36:54,141 --> 03:37:01,968
because you are within 20 feet of it. As it's in
the air, its tail whips out toward you. That is a

2910
03:37:01,968 --> 03:37:06,764
32 to hit.

2911
03:37:06,764 --> 03:37:08,908
(laughter)

2912
03:37:08,908 --> 03:37:12,748
ASHLEY: Yeah. Nope. No. Doesn't hit.

2913
03:37:12,748 --> 03:37:20,679
MATT: You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage.

2914
03:37:20,679 --> 03:37:23,136
ASHLEY: And I'm staying up there?

2915
03:37:23,136 --> 03:37:28,658
MATT: You're barely holding on up there, but yes.
You take the brunt of it with your shield, and it

2916
03:37:28,658 --> 03:37:33,993
almost knocks you off the side. You manage to take
your sword and dig in to the opposite side and

2917
03:37:33,993 --> 03:37:42,822
catch yourself on the edge of the pillar. It does
not knock you off. Scanlan, it is now your turn.

2918
03:37:42,822 --> 03:37:47,320
At the top of your turn, you take six points of
acid damage, reduced to three, as you've found

2919
03:37:47,320 --> 03:37:50,144
your way into the stomach. He did not.

2920
03:37:50,144 --> 03:37:52,109
SAM: Is it big in there?

2921
03:37:52,109 --> 03:37:57,846
MATT: It's fairly spacious, but it's all squeezed
together right now. It's not a giant, empty void,

2922
03:37:57,846 --> 03:38:00,759
it's not a giant pocket of air in your stomach, it
is a--

2923
03:38:00,759 --> 03:38:01,997
LIAM: Click, motherfucker, click.

2924
03:38:01,997 --> 03:38:08,146
MATT: You're also holding your breath. You are
also submerged in liquid that is dissolving you.

2925
03:38:08,146 --> 03:38:10,610
SAM: I can move my arms, though.

2926
03:38:10,610 --> 03:38:14,341
MATT: You can. You're still pressed in but you can
move your hands, yeah.

2927
03:38:14,341 --> 03:38:17,962
SAM: Okay, that's good. I'm going to get that rod
out and click it.

2928
03:38:17,962 --> 03:38:26,546
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Pulling out-- This is going
to be weird. All right. So you take out the

2929
03:38:26,546 --> 03:38:32,398
immovable rod and click it and as you release it, it
stays there aloft in the center. You have

2930
03:38:32,398 --> 03:38:34,006
darkvision as a gnome, correct?

2931
03:38:34,006 --> 03:38:35,096
SAM: Yes.

2932
03:38:35,096 --> 03:38:40,243
MATT: Right, so there in this space amongst the
murky liquid you can just barely see its shape

2933
03:38:40,243 --> 03:38:41,991
there and it is held aloft, yes.

2934
03:38:41,991 --> 03:38:47,536
SAM: Okay. That's good, that's positive, guys.
We're getting somewhere. Is that my movement? Is

2935
03:38:47,536 --> 03:38:49,535
that my bonus? What is that?

2936
03:38:49,535 --> 03:38:54,164
MATT: No, that's your action to pull it out and
click it. Because it's not easy to do in your

2937
03:38:54,164 --> 03:38:55,394
current circumstance.

2938
03:38:55,394 --> 03:39:01,766
SAM: Sure. Okay. Well, I guess that's my action
and I guess as a bonus action I can't really do

2939
03:39:01,766 --> 03:39:10,036
anything. (laughs) I can't inspire anyone because
I don't think I can hear-- oh! I'm going to use

2940
03:39:10,036 --> 03:39:22,727
the earring. Shit. Fuck. I'm going to just start
screaming and say: can you hear me, Vax?

2941
03:39:22,727 --> 03:39:26,081
MATT: You guys hear through the earring,
(incoherent high-pitched babbling). The air has

2942
03:39:26,081 --> 03:39:27,458
now escaped your lungs.

2943
03:39:27,458 --> 03:39:29,161
SAM: Fuck!

2944
03:39:29,161 --> 03:39:42,509
MATT: You're not drowning yet. That ends your
turn. Vex, you're up.

2945
03:39:42,509 --> 03:39:47,798
LAURA: Do I get advantage on attacking it because
of Guiding Bolt?

2946
03:39:47,798 --> 03:39:49,859
MATT: You do. The next attack, yes.

2947
03:39:49,859 --> 03:39:52,940
SAM: Did Vax reply?

2948
03:39:52,940 --> 03:39:59,204
MATT: Yeah, the Guiding Bolt, because the Guiding
Bolt's technically the next attack, it did not

2949
03:39:59,204 --> 03:40:02,351
give you advantage on the attack, because you're
on the inside and you don't actually see the

2950
03:40:02,351 --> 03:40:05,044
Guiding Bolt. It would go over to the next one.

2951
03:40:05,044 --> 03:40:07,290
LIAM: I don't know what the fuck's going on, Matt,
it's fine.

2952
03:40:07,290 --> 03:40:15,129
LAURA: I've got to see, because I just want to
know. How far does Grasping Vine go? Do you know,

2953
03:40:15,129 --> 03:40:16,322
Keyleth?

2954
03:40:16,322 --> 03:40:21,909
MARISHA: 60 feet? I can tell you super fast. No,
30 feet.

2955
03:40:21,909 --> 03:40:24,042
LAURA: How high in the air is--

2956
03:40:24,042 --> 03:40:25,948
MATT: He is 30 feet up right now.

2957
03:40:25,948 --> 03:40:32,674
MARISHA: You technically have a pillar that's 30
feet high adjacent to him that you can anchor it

2958
03:40:32,674 --> 03:40:34,276
into a pillar.

2959
03:40:34,276 --> 03:40:40,543
LAURA: I'm going to-- can it go from the bottom of
the pillar up towards him?

2960
03:40:40,543 --> 03:40:43,311
MATT: If you want to. Down here, you mean?

2961
03:40:43,311 --> 03:40:48,652
LAURA: Yeah, I want to try to grasp onto one of
his legs and yank him back down towards the

2962
03:40:48,652 --> 03:40:53,137
ground. Ooh, which would really hurt with the
immovable rod inside of him.

2963
03:40:53,137 --> 03:41:01,643
MATT: Okay. All right. So using your bonus action,
you conjure the vine as your one 4th-level spell.

2964
03:41:01,643 --> 03:41:03,779
LAURA: I have two because I have a pearl of
power.

2965
03:41:03,779 --> 03:41:07,439
MATT: Oh. So you would've had to have prepared
that in advance. But yes, we'll say you do.

2966
03:41:07,439 --> 03:41:10,445
LAURA: Okay. Oh, I didn't tell you. I should
have.

2967
03:41:10,445 --> 03:41:13,959
MATT: You should have told me. But we'll say as
part of the preparation you did that, okay. So

2968
03:41:13,959 --> 03:41:17,911
Grasping Vine appears, lashes out from this pillar
up at Umbrasyl.

2969
03:41:17,911 --> 03:41:19,339
LAURA: Yeah.

2970
03:41:19,339 --> 03:41:23,120
MATT: All right. The creature has to succeed on a
dexterity saving throw or be pulled-- what's the

2971
03:41:23,120 --> 03:41:24,434
DC on your spell?

2972
03:41:24,434 --> 03:41:25,807
LAURA: Um, 16.

2973
03:41:25,807 --> 03:41:34,630
MATT: 16. That is a nine plus nine, that is 18. So
the vine whips out and Umbrasyl backs up and pulls

2974
03:41:34,630 --> 03:41:37,639
the leg up and it just hits the air beneath. Kicks
away the vine.

2975
03:41:37,639 --> 03:41:41,354
LAURA: That was my bonus.

2976
03:41:41,354 --> 03:41:42,539
MATT: Yeah.

2977
03:41:42,539 --> 03:41:45,528
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to attack him three
times with my hasting.

2978
03:41:45,528 --> 03:41:48,385
MATT: Go for it. Yeah, three attacks.

2979
03:41:48,385 --> 03:41:49,743
LAURA: All right.

2980
03:41:49,743 --> 03:41:51,239
MATT: First one has advantage.

2981
03:41:51,239 --> 03:42:00,355
LAURA: Okay. 24?

2982
03:42:00,355 --> 03:42:01,605
MATT: 24 hits.

2983
03:42:01,605 --> 03:42:14,598
LAURA: Okay. And that's sneak attack, because he's
got somebody close to him. Inside of him.

2984
03:42:14,598 --> 03:42:18,758
MATT: It's technically not sneak attack. It's not
so much about-- there's somebody close, but a

2985
03:42:18,758 --> 03:42:23,138
person that is not threatening him from his
current physical space, it is a bit of heartburn

2986
03:42:23,138 --> 03:42:27,009
for him right now. You don't sneak attack somebody
from eating bad pasta.

2987
03:42:27,009 --> 03:42:30,289
LAURA: Cool. Then just seven--

2988
03:42:30,289 --> 03:42:31,911
SAM: Did he move?

2989
03:42:31,911 --> 03:42:36,988
MATT: Not yet, no. So how much damage is that?

2990
03:42:36,988 --> 03:42:38,497
LAURA: Ten.

2991
03:42:38,497 --> 03:42:40,111
MATT: Ten points of damage for the first attack.

2992
03:42:40,111 --> 03:42:41,256
LAURA: For the first attack.

2993
03:42:41,256 --> 03:42:45,046
MATT: Second attack? This does not have advantage,
only the first one did. What was your first roll?

2994
03:42:45,046 --> 03:42:49,891
LAURA: Then it doesn't hit. Then 26 for the last
one.

2995
03:42:49,891 --> 03:42:55,359
MATT: 26 hits, so the first one hits, sticks part
in the front of its armor, doesn't seem to phase

2996
03:42:55,359 --> 03:42:58,192
it, the second one it actually hits the wing and
the wing just shatters it and knocks it out of the

2997
03:42:58,192 --> 03:43:02,386
air as it's keeping itself up. The third one,
however, does strike and hit and it'll actually go

2998
03:43:02,386 --> 03:43:04,706
between the scales of the neck. Roll for damage.

2999
03:43:04,706 --> 03:43:06,445
LAURA: Nine.

3000
03:43:06,445 --> 03:43:12,817
MATT: Nine points of damage. Both arrows sticking
out of the hardened exterior of the ancient black

3001
03:43:12,817 --> 03:43:14,108
dragon.

3002
03:43:14,108 --> 03:43:16,192
LAURA: The Grasping Vine just still hangs out
there?

3003
03:43:16,192 --> 03:43:19,525
MATT: Yeah, it's just chilling on the side there.
As long as you maintain concentration, it'll stay.

3004
03:43:19,525 --> 03:43:20,650
TRAVIS: Is it grabbing him or not?

3005
03:43:20,650 --> 03:43:24,784
MATT: It failed with the grab. All right. End of
your turn? Is that what you're doing?

3006
03:43:24,784 --> 03:43:28,137
LAURA: Am I hiding still?

3007
03:43:28,137 --> 03:43:34,338
MATT: You have to use a bonus action to try and
hide if you began the turn hiding. Or you can use

3008
03:43:34,338 --> 03:43:38,506
your extra action from the haste to do it, but you
already used it to attack, so you're not hidden.

3009
03:43:38,506 --> 03:43:40,906
LAURA: Ugh! Fine.

3010
03:43:40,906 --> 03:43:43,362
MATT: (laughs) End of your turn, it's going to use
another legendary action to do another tail attack

3011
03:43:43,362 --> 03:43:44,701
against you, Pike.

3012
03:43:44,701 --> 03:43:46,209
TRAVIS: Is that the third one?

3013
03:43:46,209 --> 03:43:53,940
MATT: That is a natural one. Umbrasyl goes to
swing and suddenly there's a pulse in the stomach

3014
03:43:53,940 --> 03:43:59,625
as you see Vax moving once again on the inside and
doing so distracts it and the tail just swings

3015
03:43:59,625 --> 03:44:04,329
overhead and you duck below it as it just barely
misses your head by inches. One of your braids

3016
03:44:04,329 --> 03:44:12,166
actually comes loose from the amount of wind that
blows by. That brings us to--

3017
03:44:12,166 --> 03:44:14,445
TRAVIS: What's left of the Herd.

3018
03:44:14,445 --> 03:44:16,362
MATT: Herd's turn.

3019
03:44:16,362 --> 03:44:20,465
TRAVIS: Come on, goliaths and Herd, please roll
better.

3020
03:44:20,465 --> 03:44:27,869
MATT: He is going to rush up around here. Grab the
chains that they can. The chains have broken, so

3021
03:44:27,869 --> 03:44:33,808
they're going to go ahead as part of their plan to
begin to just unleash weaponry, so they just run through--

3022
03:44:33,808 --> 03:44:36,428
MARISHA: Have they all broken? Maybe some just
came loose.

3023
03:44:36,428 --> 03:44:43,634
MATT: This was their plan. The plan they agreed
to. They're all taking out javelins now. They had

3024
03:44:43,634 --> 03:44:45,888
them at their side. They're all leaping up towards
it.

3025
03:44:45,888 --> 03:44:51,567
LAURA: Are they just the stupidest goliaths, that
they're all clumping together again?

3026
03:44:51,636 --> 03:44:54,170
LIAM: That's redundant.

3027
03:44:54,170 --> 03:44:56,602
LAURA: These guys are dumb.

3028
03:44:56,602 --> 03:45:00,550
MATT: You've met...

3029
03:45:00,610 --> 03:45:08,386
TRAVIS: Scholars, the lot. You're going to pay for
that later, by the way.

3030
03:45:08,386 --> 03:45:22,535
MATT: All right, so they're all going to take
javelin shots at-- miss. Miss. Two-- miss. Hit.

3031
03:45:22,535 --> 03:45:37,171
Hit. Three hits. And so they're all just (effort
sounds) chucking these javelins upward. Four,

3032
03:45:37,171 --> 03:45:46,780
eight, that's 12, plus seven-- 19 points of damage from
the javelins as some stick in then fall out, the

3033
03:45:46,780 --> 03:45:53,697
wounds are now becoming visible. Umbrasyl's--
there's visible wounding but doesn't appear to be

3034
03:45:53,697 --> 03:45:57,409
in dire straits or anything. Grog, you're up.

3035
03:45:57,409 --> 03:46:01,970
TRAVIS: Yes, I have two questions. One of the
things I picked up from Kevdak were four enchanted

3036
03:46:01,970 --> 03:46:05,012
javelins. What do those do?

3037
03:46:05,012 --> 03:46:07,969
MATT: They're thrown, ranged attacks.

3038
03:46:07,969 --> 03:46:09,621
TRAVIS: And they're just enchanted?

3039
03:46:09,621 --> 03:46:11,302
MATT: They're plus one to hit and damage.

3040
03:46:11,302 --> 03:46:12,360
TRAVIS: Just that.

3041
03:46:12,360 --> 03:46:16,304
MATT: That's it, yeah. It's a relatively simple
enchantment.

3042
03:46:16,304 --> 03:46:21,475
TRAVIS: What is my climbing speed? If my natural
speed is 50 and I wanted to climb that column,

3043
03:46:21,475 --> 03:46:23,373
what's the climbing speed?

3044
03:46:23,373 --> 03:46:38,215
MATT: Climbing speed? I mean, if you roll a decent
climb check-- here. That would be-- I'd say that

3045
03:46:38,215 --> 03:46:41,720
would be an athletics check to see if you can
climb it, and I'd put it at about half speed. But

3046
03:46:41,720 --> 03:46:45,418
you're also prone, so getting up from that's half
your speed.

3047
03:46:45,418 --> 03:46:50,535
TRAVIS: On my back, can I use my bonus action to
drink the potion of speed, which makes me hasted?

3048
03:46:50,535 --> 03:46:55,111
MATT: Yes you can. You now have technically four
attacks per round.

3049
03:46:55,111 --> 03:46:59,179
TRAVIS: I do. And it doubles my speed, right?

3050
03:46:59,179 --> 03:47:00,534
MATT: Yes.

3051
03:47:00,534 --> 03:47:02,800
TRAVIS: Okay, so I have 100 feet, so can I stand
up?

3052
03:47:02,800 --> 03:47:06,181
MATT: Yep. 50 feet.

3053
03:47:06,181 --> 03:47:10,093
TRAVIS: Can I try and climb that column towards
Umbrasyl's feet?

3054
03:47:10,093 --> 03:47:11,589
MATT: Athletics check.

3055
03:47:11,589 --> 03:47:19,299
TRAVIS: That's not awesome. 18.

3056
03:47:19,299 --> 03:47:25,019
MATT: 18. You just manage to get to the top with
the last bit of your movement. So you are up about

3057
03:47:25,019 --> 03:47:31,359
ten feet from Umbrasyl right now, pushing on 15 at
an angle.

3058
03:47:31,359 --> 03:47:33,236
TRAVIS: So I have four attacks?

3059
03:47:33,236 --> 03:47:35,363
MATT: Yes. You're not in melee, though.

3060
03:47:35,363 --> 03:47:41,706
TRAVIS: Yeah, so I'll use three of the enchanted
javelins and the javelin of lightning.

3061
03:47:41,706 --> 03:47:53,398
MATT: Okay. All right, so you (effort sounds)
finally with the javelin of lightning. So go ahead

3062
03:47:53,398 --> 03:47:55,284
and make the first three strikes.

3063
03:47:55,284 --> 03:47:58,365
TRAVIS: Reckless, all of them.

3064
03:47:58,365 --> 03:48:04,276
MATT: Okay, so with advantage on each of these.
The range on the javelin strikes, I'm just going

3065
03:48:04,276 --> 03:48:06,285
to pull it up real fast, since this is the first
time you've used this.

3066
03:48:06,285 --> 03:48:08,773
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's 120 feet for the javelin of
lightning.

3067
03:48:08,773 --> 03:48:17,817
MATT: Yeah, within 30-foot range, so it's fine. Go
ahead and roll. First one is?

3068
03:48:17,817 --> 03:48:22,075
TRAVIS: It's an 11 plus-- just my natural like--

3069
03:48:22,075 --> 03:48:24,996
MATT: It's 11 plus one for being enchanted.

3070
03:48:24,996 --> 03:48:26,133
TRAVIS: Right.

3071
03:48:26,133 --> 03:48:28,090
MATT: Plus your strength modifier and your
proficiency modifier.

3072
03:48:28,090 --> 03:48:31,561
TRAVIS: Oh no, my proficiency--

3073
03:48:31,561 --> 03:48:36,866
MATT: Which is plus seven, I believe. Plus-- so
yeah, that hits.

3074
03:48:36,866 --> 03:48:41,215
TRAVIS: Okay. Where's my proficiency-- oh five, I
got it.

3075
03:48:41,215 --> 03:48:45,069
MATT: Yeah, you're looking at plus 13 with these
attacks. The first one hits.

3076
03:48:45,069 --> 03:48:46,147
TRAVIS: Okay.

3077
03:48:46,147 --> 03:48:47,378
MATT: Second one.

3078
03:48:47,378 --> 03:48:48,525
TRAVIS: Is 28.

3079
03:48:48,525 --> 03:48:49,787
MATT: Hits. Third one.

3080
03:48:49,787 --> 03:48:52,552
TRAVIS: Is 19.

3081
03:48:52,552 --> 03:48:59,231
MATT: Misses. The lightning javelin you just throw
and I think it hits.

3082
03:48:59,231 --> 03:49:01,535
TRAVIS: And the second one, the last one is a 30.

3083
03:49:01,535 --> 03:49:04,034
MATT: The last one, I don't think you actually
roll to hit with the javelin, it just becomes a

3084
03:49:04,034 --> 03:49:05,135
bolt of lightning.

3085
03:49:05,135 --> 03:49:06,258
TRAVIS: That's right.

3086
03:49:06,258 --> 03:49:10,393
MATT: So roll 1d6 plus eight for damage on two of
those javelins.

3087
03:49:10,393 --> 03:49:13,203
TRAVIS: So that's 12.

3088
03:49:13,203 --> 03:49:14,582
MATT: All right.

3089
03:49:14,582 --> 03:49:17,964
TRAVIS: 14.

3090
03:49:17,964 --> 03:49:27,599
MATT: All righty. And now with the javelin of
lightning. Makes its save. That is a 21 with the

3091
03:49:27,599 --> 03:49:29,185
save. What's the DC?

3092
03:49:29,185 --> 03:49:31,110
TRAVIS: 17.

3093
03:49:31,110 --> 03:49:33,374
MATT: 17, so it takes the half damage.

3094
03:49:33,374 --> 03:49:34,406
TRAVIS: Okay.

3095
03:49:34,406 --> 03:49:35,829
MATT: What's the damage on it total?

3096
03:49:35,829 --> 03:49:36,927
TRAVIS: 4d6.

3097
03:49:36,927 --> 03:49:38,798
MATT: Go ahead and roll that and he takes half
damage.

3098
03:49:38,798 --> 03:49:44,334
TRAVIS: 13.

3099
03:49:44,334 --> 03:49:48,728
MATT: 13, all righty. So 13, and then halved.

3100
03:49:48,728 --> 03:49:52,210
TRAVIS: Six--

3101
03:49:52,210 --> 03:49:57,310
MATT: Six points of lightning damage. Okay. The
last hit, the javelin turns into a bolt of

3102
03:49:57,310 --> 03:50:01,839
lightning, and streaks through, hits and impacts
and then just falls to the ground, the energy

3103
03:50:01,839 --> 03:50:10,442
expended. Jamming itself into the dirt not far
from the ground. End of your turn, Grog. Percy,

3104
03:50:10,442 --> 03:50:11,667
you're up.

3105
03:50:11,667 --> 03:50:14,164
TALIESIN: Okay, my first shot, taking a wing
shot.

3106
03:50:14,164 --> 03:50:15,686
MATT: All right, go for it.

3107
03:50:15,686 --> 03:50:23,179
TALIESIN: That's 20, that does not hit.

3108
03:50:23,179 --> 03:50:25,967
MATT: 20. It just ricochets off the armor.

3109
03:50:25,967 --> 03:50:29,526
TALIESIN: All right, that's one grit. Taking
another shot.

3110
03:50:29,526 --> 03:50:32,096
MATT: Okay, reload, and then shot again.

3111
03:50:32,096 --> 03:50:34,564
TALIESIN: That hits. 30.

3112
03:50:34,564 --> 03:50:36,919
MATT: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3113
03:50:36,919 --> 03:50:55,208
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage. And he has to make
a strength saving throw.

3114
03:50:55,208 --> 03:50:58,771
MATT: Strength saving throw. That is a 19.

3115
03:50:58,771 --> 03:51:01,233
TALIESIN: DC is 19.

3116
03:51:01,233 --> 03:51:02,978
MATT: Okay, so it succeeds.

3117
03:51:02,978 --> 03:51:05,234
TALIESIN: It succeeds on the 19?

3118
03:51:05,234 --> 03:51:07,582
MATT: Yeah, you have to meet or exceed.

3119
03:51:07,582 --> 03:51:11,164
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to burn an action surge
to take a third shot.

3120
03:51:11,164 --> 03:51:14,205
MATT: All right. So reload, shot, reload. Go for
it.

3121
03:51:14,205 --> 03:51:20,495
TALIESIN: 21 does not hit?

3122
03:51:20,495 --> 03:51:26,681
MATT: 21 does not hit. It just steers wide,
shooting past the beating wings.

3123
03:51:26,681 --> 03:51:34,699
TALIESIN: Yeah, and then I'm going to just hide
behind that tree and wait for my next round.

3124
03:51:34,699 --> 03:51:43,925
MATT: Okay. All right. Ending your turn, Percy.
Noja is going to use the third and final Lightning

3125
03:51:43,925 --> 03:52:02,654
Bolt, now arcing up to the entity. Makes its save
with a 27. All right, bringing us to-- 8d6. 13

3126
03:52:02,654 --> 03:52:06,824
points of lightning damage against Umbrasyl from
Noja, and Noja steps back behind, looking

3127
03:52:06,824 --> 03:52:14,651
exasperated and spent on some of the upper-echelon
spells at his disposal. Now it comes to--

3128
03:52:14,651 --> 03:52:18,464
actually, at the end of Noja's turn, Umbrasyl's
going to use its last legendary action to make one

3129
03:52:18,464 --> 03:52:20,677
more tail swipe at you, Grog.

3130
03:52:20,677 --> 03:52:22,134
TRAVIS: Yup.

3131
03:52:22,134 --> 03:52:24,958
MATT: That is going to be a 29 to hit.

3132
03:52:24,958 --> 03:52:26,224
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3133
03:52:26,224 --> 03:52:35,466
MATT: All righty. You take-- that's really bad.
That's 11 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five.

3134
03:52:35,466 --> 03:52:37,948
TRAVIS: I stay up?

3135
03:52:37,948 --> 03:52:39,575
MATT: Yeah, you stay up.

3136
03:52:39,575 --> 03:52:41,235
(loud clanging sound from Skype)

3137
03:52:41,235 --> 03:52:44,536
MATT: What's happening over there?

3138
03:52:44,536 --> 03:52:46,166
LIAM: Taliesin!

3139
03:52:46,166 --> 03:52:59,077
MATT: All right. Top of Umbrasyl's turn. See if
this recharges. Umbrasyl is going to attempt to

3140
03:52:59,077 --> 03:53:00,392
move to the left.

3141
03:53:00,392 --> 03:53:04,279
LIAM: Yeah, try it, buddy. Internal damage.

3142
03:53:04,279 --> 03:53:10,514
SAM: The rod supports 8,000 pounds of pressure.

3143
03:53:10,514 --> 03:53:15,816
MATT: Correct. If the creature pushes against it,
it must make a DC 30 strength check to move the

3144
03:53:15,816 --> 03:53:23,380
rod up to ten feet in a single round. So. Nope.

3145
03:53:23,380 --> 03:53:25,278
LIAM: That thing's fixed in space.

3146
03:53:25,278 --> 03:53:32,950
MATT: It goes to move and (grunts) and is feeling
something tear through on the inside of its area

3147
03:53:32,950 --> 03:53:41,300
so it stops with this sharp pain. Takes one point
of damage, but the warning is there. It does not

3148
03:53:41,300 --> 03:53:50,383
move. However, (laughs) the acid breath did
recharge on a five. It's going to go ahead and go

3149
03:53:50,383 --> 03:53:54,266
right there. Angrily lay down right there.

3150
03:53:54,266 --> 03:53:55,596
LAURA: No!

3151
03:53:55,596 --> 03:53:57,081
ASHLEY: No!

3152
03:53:57,081 --> 03:53:59,097
LIAM: But you're resistant.

3153
03:53:59,097 --> 03:54:06,946
TALIESIN: Isn't he having plummeting issues if
he's not moving?

3154
03:54:06,946 --> 03:54:10,513
MATT: No, if your speed is zero you plummet is how
it works.

3155
03:54:10,513 --> 03:54:11,967
TALIESIN: Okay.

3156
03:54:11,967 --> 03:54:21,372
MATT: No, they all fail. All right. They are all
right over here. Wrecked. Wrecked. Wrecked.

3157
03:54:21,372 --> 03:54:22,991
Wrecked.

3158
03:54:22,991 --> 03:54:24,723
LAURA: Where's Zanror?

3159
03:54:24,723 --> 03:54:26,442
MATT: Zanror's right there at the bottom.

3160
03:54:26,442 --> 03:54:29,080
LAURA: Where's his wife?

3161
03:54:29,080 --> 03:54:37,512
MATT: His wife is over here. And when I say
wrecked, they're on the ground, their flesh

3162
03:54:37,512 --> 03:54:44,675
dissolving and screaming in pain. The Herd has
been heavily culled in but a few rounds. There's a

3163
03:54:44,675 --> 03:54:52,228
little bit of horror to it. I need both Grog and
Keyleth as an earth elemental to make a dexterity

3164
03:54:52,228 --> 03:54:53,686
saving throw.

3165
03:54:53,686 --> 03:54:56,920
TRAVIS: 16.

3166
03:54:56,920 --> 03:55:06,081
MARISHA: I rolled a two with a minus one, so one.
Not a natural one. Rolled a two.

3167
03:55:06,081 --> 03:55:10,028
MATT: You both suffer 82 points of acid damage.

3168
03:55:10,028 --> 03:55:11,368
MARISHA: Okay.

3169
03:55:11,368 --> 03:55:13,366
TRAVIS: Resistance, so I halve that?

3170
03:55:13,366 --> 03:55:15,301
MATT: Yeah, you take 41 points of acid damage.

3171
03:55:15,301 --> 03:55:29,863
MARISHA: I'm in tank mode, so I'm good. I'm an
earth elemental.

3172
03:55:29,863 --> 03:55:36,915
MATT: Unable to move, that is the end of
Umbrasyl's turn. That's messed up.

3173
03:55:36,915 --> 03:55:40,113
(laughter)

3174
03:55:40,113 --> 03:55:42,819
MATT: Pike, you're up.

3175
03:55:42,819 --> 03:55:48,268
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Blindness on him.

3176
03:55:48,268 --> 03:55:56,710
MATT: What's the DC on the check? What is it, is
it wisdom?

3177
03:55:56,710 --> 03:56:03,158
ASHLEY: I think it's constitution. Constitution
saving throw.

3178
03:56:03,158 --> 03:56:10,156
MATT: All right, constitution saving throw. That
is 18 plus 14. 32. I think that succeeds.

3179
03:56:10,156 --> 03:56:14,558
LIAM: You don't know. She might've rolled a 78.

3180
03:56:14,558 --> 03:56:21,069
ASHLEY: You don't know! That's fine. I'm going to
move my Spiritual Weapon.

3181
03:56:21,069 --> 03:56:27,338
MATT: All right. So it now shifts up into space as
a bonus action, and you can make a ranged spell

3182
03:56:27,338 --> 03:56:32,567
attack against it as the sword arcs upward towards
Umbrasyl. Go ahead and roll, add your spell attack

3183
03:56:32,567 --> 03:56:33,995
modifier.

3184
03:56:33,995 --> 03:56:37,312
ASHLEY: 29.

3185
03:56:37,312 --> 03:56:51,604
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 1d8
plus five, correct? Pretty sure.

3186
03:56:51,604 --> 03:56:55,234
ASHLEY: 1d8 for every two slot levels--

3187
03:56:55,234 --> 03:57:03,088
MATT: You did second level for that one, because 
it was a bonus action. 1d8 plus five.

3188
03:57:03,088 --> 03:57:09,786
ASHLEY: Nine.

3189
03:57:09,786 --> 03:57:15,953
MATT: Nine points of damage against Umbrasyl.
Blade just streaks across and more sparks fly, but

3190
03:57:15,953 --> 03:57:21,673
this time you can see it left a carve of glowing
red mark across the scales where the blade managed

3191
03:57:21,673 --> 03:57:27,845
to do some damage to it. That ends your turn,
Pike. Vax, you're up. You immediately take eight

3192
03:57:27,845 --> 03:57:34,714
points of bludgeoning damage as it begins to crush
you from the inside.

3193
03:57:34,714 --> 03:57:43,690
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to--
can I sneak attack this thing from inside? I'm

3194
03:57:43,690 --> 03:57:49,095
inside him! That's very surprising!

3195
03:57:49,095 --> 03:57:57,491
MATT: It's different! It's not like a soft gooey
center. All of its body is still very dense,

3196
03:57:57,491 --> 03:58:01,293
sinewy muscle in the vicinity. You don't know
where you are in its body, so you don't know where

3197
03:58:01,293 --> 03:58:09,171
the actual weak points are. So, given those
circumstances, your ability to barely move--

3198
03:58:09,171 --> 03:58:10,857
Probably not.

3199
03:58:10,857 --> 03:58:16,470
LIAM: Probably not? All right. Well. I'm going to
use my bonus action first to hit it. It's at

3200
03:58:16,470 --> 03:58:17,633
disadvantage?

3201
03:58:17,633 --> 03:58:19,962
MATT: Yes. All attacks because you're still restrained.

3202
03:58:19,962 --> 03:58:23,933
LIAM: Okay, so that is 19, which fucks up.

3203
03:58:23,933 --> 03:58:26,250
MATT: That unfortunately is not cutting through.

3204
03:58:26,250 --> 03:58:32,838
LIAM: And now I'm going to use the dragon sword.
Okay. That's a 21?

3205
03:58:32,838 --> 03:58:38,708
MATT: 21, just barely not able to cut through the
dense hide, the blade is caught on what feels like

3206
03:58:38,708 --> 03:58:42,464
a ligament or something, it can't quite carve
through with your body all crushed up inside.

3207
03:58:42,464 --> 03:58:49,168
LIAM: Well. I will, for my turn, suffocate and
also Fassbender should still be trying to

3208
03:58:49,168 --> 03:58:50,929
recharge.

3209
03:58:50,929 --> 03:58:54,431
MATT: Correct. So go ahead and roll a d6.

3210
03:58:54,431 --> 03:58:55,770
LIAM: d6. Four.

3211
03:58:55,770 --> 03:59:09,811
MATT: Four. Fassbender's still standing there. On
a five or six, it recharges. That ends Vax's turn.

3212
03:59:09,811 --> 03:59:11,382
Keyleth, you're up.

3213
03:59:11,382 --> 03:59:15,779
MARISHA: Okay. As an earth elemental I want to
drop into the earth and Earthglide.

3214
03:59:15,779 --> 03:59:19,652
MATT: All right. How many feet are you going?

3215
03:59:19,652 --> 03:59:28,521
MARISHA: With my 60 feet-- question, can I get
across and to the top of this pillar here? Maybe?

3216
03:59:28,521 --> 03:59:37,474
MATT: Oh, right there?

3217
03:59:37,474 --> 03:59:38,599
MARISHA: That one.

3218
03:59:38,599 --> 03:59:41,487
MATT: You can get up to there. You're wider than
the pillar, though. You like--

3219
03:59:41,487 --> 03:59:51,835
MARISHA: Earthglide to the top, so it's 30 feet
tall. (nervous laughter) And I'm going to use my

3220
03:59:51,835 --> 03:59:58,935
momentum to see if I can rocket myself out and see
if I can jump and grab onto his leg.

3221
03:59:58,935 --> 04:00:04,103
MATT: Okay, so you're making this a jump action, then?

3222
04:00:04,103 --> 04:00:08,983
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to shoot out of the pillar.

3223
04:00:08,983 --> 04:00:10,815
MATT: Using the momentum of the Earthglide?

3224
04:00:10,815 --> 04:00:19,638
MARISHA: And shoot out with a waterslide
trajectory, woo! Yeah? Maybe?

3225
04:00:19,638 --> 04:00:29,413
MATT: Okay. I'll say that-- It's pretty fast--
Also pretty heavy as an earth elemental.

3226
04:00:29,413 --> 04:00:33,251
MARISHA: I'm thinking about it real hard.

3227
04:00:33,251 --> 04:00:36,222
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

3228
04:00:36,222 --> 04:00:38,978
MARISHA: So is that strength as a--

3229
04:00:38,978 --> 04:00:43,157
MATT: That would be strength as an earth elemental
if you do not have a specific skill for it.

3230
04:00:43,157 --> 04:00:50,836
MARISHA: I'm going to use Scanlan's inspiration.
Ooh, that's good. 18 plus five, so, 23.

3231
04:00:50,836 --> 04:00:56,577
MATT: 23. You manage to leap and catch the bottom
of its foot.

3232
04:00:56,577 --> 04:00:59,327
(cheering)

3233
04:00:59,327 --> 04:01:02,639
MATT: You're not halting or doing anything to
Umbrasyl other than the fact that you're holding

3234
04:01:02,639 --> 04:01:04,009
on to--

3235
04:01:04,009 --> 04:01:09,850
MARISHA: But I've got his foot. And I'm heavy as
fuck. Well, if Fassbender weighs, what was it,

3236
04:01:09,850 --> 04:01:13,538
like 1,200 pounds? 2,800 pounds?

3237
04:01:13,538 --> 04:01:15,115
MATT: Yeah.

3238
04:01:15,115 --> 04:01:19,552
MARISHA: So I'm at least as heavy if not heavier
than Fassbender.

3239
04:01:19,552 --> 04:01:21,899
MARISHA: A ton is 1,000 pounds. Right?

3240
04:01:21,899 --> 04:01:23,439
MATT: 2,000.

3241
04:01:23,439 --> 04:01:24,679
MARISHA: 2,000 pounds.

3242
04:01:24,679 --> 04:01:26,115
LAURA: I thought a ton was 3,000 pounds.

3243
04:01:26,115 --> 04:01:30,586
MARISHA: None of us fucking know. Why didn't we go
metric?

3244
04:01:30,586 --> 04:01:33,537
MATT: The European watchers are like--

3245
04:01:33,537 --> 04:01:39,694
MARISHA: Yeah, what are they talking about? Okay.
I'm holding on for dear life.

3246
04:01:39,694 --> 04:01:41,891
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

3247
04:01:41,891 --> 04:01:48,093
SAM: I know from my experience going to the pubs
with Grog--

3248
04:01:48,093 --> 04:01:52,819
MATT: Take eight points of acid damage, by the
way, as you're slowly dissolving. Reduced to four.

3249
04:01:52,819 --> 04:01:56,936
SAM: I'm fine. How's my lungs?

3250
04:01:56,936 --> 04:01:59,964
MATT: Oh Keyleth, by the way, I need you to make a
concentration check before I forget.

3251
04:01:59,964 --> 04:02:06,629
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. No, that's. Wait, do I add
anything?

3252
04:02:06,629 --> 04:02:12,521
MATT: Well the DC is half the damage you took from
the breath weapon, so 40. So who did you cast the

3253
04:02:12,521 --> 04:02:15,105
resist acid on? You're no longer resistant to
acid, Grog.

3254
04:02:15,105 --> 04:02:16,392
TRAVIS: Copy that.

3255
04:02:16,392 --> 04:02:17,450
MARISHA: Sorry.

3256
04:02:17,450 --> 04:02:18,665
TRAVIS: No, it came in handy for the one.

3257
04:02:18,665 --> 04:02:19,896
MARISHA: It did.

3258
04:02:19,896 --> 04:02:24,349
SAM: How's my lungs? Am I dying here?

3259
04:02:24,349 --> 04:02:27,979
MATT: Your air is out, you're still holding your
breath, per se, but you have one more round before

3260
04:02:27,979 --> 04:02:30,010
you actually probably start--

3261
04:02:30,010 --> 04:02:35,515
LIAM: I would like to say that Liam O'Brien, who's
a total wuss-puss, can hold his breath for like 50

3262
04:02:35,515 --> 04:02:36,728
seconds.

3263
04:02:36,728 --> 04:02:38,285
SAM: While you're screaming?

3264
04:02:38,285 --> 04:02:39,844
LIAM: So Vax and Scanlan should be--

3265
04:02:39,844 --> 04:02:44,307
MATT: You're doing okay. He screamed and released
all the air out of his lungs. So he's now

3266
04:02:44,307 --> 04:02:47,034
completely collapsed lungs, no air to subsist on.

3267
04:02:47,034 --> 04:02:55,847
SAM: I'm almost out. I'm going to see if I can
last one more round in here.

3268
04:02:55,847 --> 04:02:58,305
MATT: Okay, what are you doing? (laughs)

3269
04:02:58,305 --> 04:03:08,273
SAM: Well, as I was saying, I know from my time
drinking with Grog that any sort of blow to the

3270
04:03:08,273 --> 04:03:16,728
stomach will really make you barf pretty easily,
so I'm going to set off a Thunderwave at level six

3271
04:03:16,728 --> 04:03:22,340
and hope that he spits me up.

3272
04:03:22,340 --> 04:03:24,736
ASHLEY: Spits you both up, maybe.

3273
04:03:24,736 --> 04:03:26,407
LIAM: I'm still in its anus.

3274
04:03:26,407 --> 04:03:28,686
TRAVIS: We don't even know where you are, really.

3275
04:03:28,686 --> 04:03:31,173
SAM: You're done, friend, sorry.

3276
04:03:31,173 --> 04:03:38,144
MATT: All right, so at a sixth level we're looking
at 7d8 thunder damage.

3277
04:03:38,144 --> 04:03:43,307
SAM: Yes. Thunder damage.

3278
04:03:43,307 --> 04:03:45,334
MATT: Go ahead and roll that.

3279
04:03:45,334 --> 04:03:46,681
MARISHA: Do you need more d8s?

3280
04:03:46,681 --> 04:03:47,882
LIAM: All part of the plan.

3281
04:03:47,882 --> 04:03:49,068
SAM: Yeah, this is totally thought-out.

3282
04:03:49,068 --> 04:03:50,904
LIAM: The hastily smushed-together plan.

3283
04:03:50,904 --> 04:03:53,195
SAM: 7d8?

3284
04:03:53,195 --> 04:03:59,508
MATT: That is a DC, it rolled a nine plus 14, so
it succeeds.

3285
04:03:59,508 --> 04:04:01,203
SAM: So it'll be halved.

3286
04:04:01,203 --> 04:04:02,475
MATT: Half damage.

3287
04:04:02,475 --> 04:04:04,166
SAM: Okay.

3288
04:04:04,166 --> 04:04:06,286
LIAM: Eat some shit, Umbrasyl.

3289
04:04:06,286 --> 04:04:14,518
SAM: 25.

3290
04:04:14,518 --> 04:04:15,689
MATT: 25.

3291
04:04:15,689 --> 04:04:17,358
SAM: Only 12 points.

3292
04:04:17,358 --> 04:04:21,509
MATT: 12 points. I need you to make a constitution
saving throw, because you are on the other side of

3293
04:04:21,509 --> 04:04:28,210
the membrane from Scanlan and suddenly there's a
giant impactful forceful blow as the outside of

3294
04:04:28,210 --> 04:04:29,433
the stomach crushes--

3295
04:04:29,433 --> 04:04:30,724
LIAM: Natural 20!

3296
04:04:30,724 --> 04:04:32,169
(cheering)

3297
04:04:32,169 --> 04:04:33,533
MATT: You take 12 points of damage as well.

3298
04:04:33,533 --> 04:04:35,025
LIAM: (laughs) Okay, I'll take it.

3299
04:04:35,025 --> 04:04:41,096
MATT: Constitution saving throw on Umbrasyl's part
for-- Rolled a natural 20, so Umbrasyl's not

3300
04:04:41,096 --> 04:04:42,277
vomiting.

3301
04:04:42,277 --> 04:04:43,522
SAM: Not vomiting.

3302
04:04:43,522 --> 04:04:47,266
MATT: Nope, rolled a natural 20 to see if it could
hold it down. There's a boof from the inside of

3303
04:04:47,266 --> 04:04:48,317
the dragon--

3304
04:04:48,317 --> 04:04:52,515
SAM: Does a little come up and he swallows it back
down?

3305
04:04:52,515 --> 04:04:54,262
MATT: Basically. A little, almost.

3306
04:04:54,262 --> 04:04:57,950
ASHLEY: Maybe you got a little air though. For
you.

3307
04:04:57,950 --> 04:04:59,774
SAM: I don't know, did that make a little air?

3308
04:04:59,774 --> 04:05:06,083
ASHLEY: Probably give you enough time to
(inhales).

3309
04:05:06,083 --> 04:05:08,606
MATT: From the source of the force that probably
pushed it away for a second, air is pulled through

3310
04:05:08,606 --> 04:05:12,932
the esophagus instinctually as when the space
opens it has to suck through, there's this (gasp)

3311
04:05:12,932 --> 04:05:21,177
sound, so yes, there is a moment of air that is
pushed back out. You can see upwards a brief

3312
04:05:21,177 --> 04:05:25,508
little glimpse of light at the top of the
esophagus as the mouth is forced open as the air

3313
04:05:25,508 --> 04:05:32,814
is pulled in and the blast streaks out angrily.
Scanlan, is that your turn?

3314
04:05:32,814 --> 04:05:40,158
SAM: I can't do much else. Do I have any
movement?

3315
04:05:40,211 --> 04:05:42,886
MATT: You are restrained so your movement is
zero.

3316
04:05:42,886 --> 04:05:46,529
SAM: Even in the water? I'm in a womb-like state.

3317
04:05:46,529 --> 04:05:52,353
MATT: You're not like floating in a giant pool of
water. You're crushed against membranes with acid.

3318
04:05:52,353 --> 04:05:57,333
Remember the scene in Akira when Tetsuo gets too
big and the girl gets crushed briefly? You're in

3319
04:05:57,333 --> 04:06:03,294
that middle period right there, you're between two
folds of stomach lining and there is just acid all

3320
04:06:03,294 --> 04:06:05,275
around. It's awesome.

3321
04:06:05,275 --> 04:06:17,922
SAM: All right. Then I can't really do much. Oh!
Shit. No, I would've had to call it earlier. Never mind.

3322
04:06:17,922 --> 04:06:19,383
ASHLEY: What?

3323
04:06:19,383 --> 04:06:27,450
LIAM: I just want to remind everyone, I am really
small. I fit between muscles, bones, ligaments,

3324
04:06:27,450 --> 04:06:28,690
anything.

3325
04:06:28,690 --> 04:06:36,935
SAM: I could have done Cutting Words after I cast
my spell, but I didn't, so forget it. Shit.

3326
04:06:36,935 --> 04:06:42,173
MATT: At the end of your turn, it's going to use a
legendary action to do a wing attack, actually two

3327
04:06:42,173 --> 04:06:48,188
actions cost. Begins beating its wings rapidly in
this vicinity. I need both Grog and Pike to make

3328
04:06:48,188 --> 04:06:49,880
dexterity saving throws.

3329
04:06:49,880 --> 04:06:52,082
LIAM: Scanlan, we're safe from all this shit.

3330
04:06:52,082 --> 04:06:57,349
SAM: I know! This is the best place to be. We're
only going to suffocate and be crushed.

3331
04:06:57,349 --> 04:06:58,634
TRAVIS: 18.

3332
04:06:58,634 --> 04:06:59,697
ASHLEY: 18.

3333
04:06:59,697 --> 04:07:09,393
MATT: Both of you take 15 points of bludgeoning
damage and are thrust towards the edge of the

3334
04:07:09,393 --> 04:07:14,476
stone, I need you both to make strength checks to
resist the force to the blow.

3335
04:07:14,476 --> 04:07:16,912
MARISHA: Hold on! Nice.

3336
04:07:16,912 --> 04:07:19,944
TRAVIS: 21.

3337
04:07:19,944 --> 04:07:26,012
ASHLEY: Ten.

3338
04:07:26,012 --> 04:07:29,135
TRAVIS: Is 15 halved for me for the bludgeoning,
or is that already halved?

3339
04:07:29,135 --> 04:07:34,590
MATT: No, it's halved for you after that. However,
you both are, from the sheer force of the wind,

3340
04:07:34,590 --> 04:07:35,882
blown off the top--

3341
04:07:35,882 --> 04:07:36,985
TRAVIS: A 21?

3342
04:07:36,985 --> 04:07:39,267
MARISHA: What did you have to beat?

3343
04:07:39,267 --> 04:07:50,345
MATT: 23. Ancient dragon. You both fall and take an
additional eight points of bludgeoning damage.

3344
04:07:50,345 --> 04:07:54,522
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my celestial shield and
cast Featherfall.

3345
04:07:54,522 --> 04:07:59,518
MATT: Okay. So you take no damage from the
additional seven. You catch yourself on the ground.

3346
04:07:59,518 --> 04:08:01,091
TRAVIS: My eight is halved.

3347
04:08:01,091 --> 04:08:15,988
MATT: Yeah, you're both prone at the bottom of the
pillars. All right. That was the end of Scanlan's

3348
04:08:15,988 --> 04:08:18,395
turn. Back to the top, Vex, you're up.

3349
04:08:18,395 --> 04:08:23,352
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try Conjure fucking
Animals again. By the way, I was wrong. My pearl

3350
04:08:23,352 --> 04:08:29,678
of power only works up to level three, so I don't
have two level fours, I already used the one. So.

3351
04:08:29,678 --> 04:08:37,636
Conjure Animals, again, two more giant eagles out
of the ether. This time I want to conjure them

3352
04:08:37,636 --> 04:08:41,883
like ten feet above his head.

3353
04:08:41,883 --> 04:08:46,534
MATT: Okay. Actually, because I didn't see you I
need you to go ahead and make a save as well,

3354
04:08:46,534 --> 04:08:49,074
because you were on it as it's beating its wings,
too.

3355
04:08:49,074 --> 04:08:51,165
MARISHA: Even though I'm holding on to his leg?

3356
04:08:51,165 --> 04:08:56,663
MATT: Yep. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw.

3357
04:08:56,663 --> 04:08:58,128
MARISHA: That's not good. Four.

3358
04:08:58,128 --> 04:09:01,528
MATT: Four. You also take 15 points of bludgeoning
damage.

3359
04:09:01,528 --> 04:09:03,904
MARISHA: Halved because I'm an elemental.

3360
04:09:03,904 --> 04:09:07,116
MATT: And I need you to go ahead and make a
strength saving throw.

3361
04:09:07,116 --> 04:09:17,600
MARISHA: Strength? 19.

3362
04:09:17,600 --> 04:09:23,231
MATT: 19. You are blown off of the dragon's body.

3363
04:09:23,231 --> 04:09:24,818
MARISHA: That sucks.

3364
04:09:24,818 --> 04:09:26,457
MATT: Like a rock slamming into the ground.

3365
04:09:26,457 --> 04:09:28,403
LAURA: Oh, she knocked out a pillar on the way
down.

3366
04:09:28,403 --> 04:09:35,308
MATT: You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage
from the impact with the ground, leaving a small

3367
04:09:35,308 --> 04:09:41,936
crater. However, there are two giant eagles that
are now floating in the vicinity around the

3368
04:09:41,936 --> 04:09:53,716
dragon. The eagles are summoned. Their initiative
is not bad. They're going to be after Grog.

3369
04:09:53,716 --> 04:10:01,795
LAURA: Okay. So they're above his head now, so if
he shoots acid down, they'll be here. And their

3370
04:10:01,795 --> 04:10:13,631
command is, attack his eyeballs. Okay. I'm going
to use my boots of haste. For my perception, would

3371
04:10:13,631 --> 04:10:20,481
I be able to see any weird little bumps on the
dragon? Because my brother's been in there a

3372
04:10:20,481 --> 04:10:22,373
while. Can I see anything going on?

3373
04:10:22,373 --> 04:10:24,157
MATT: Make a perception check.

3374
04:10:24,157 --> 04:10:33,658
LIAM: I'm behind his left nipple. It's pretty good
already. It's pretty good.

3375
04:10:33,658 --> 04:10:35,547
SAM: Our earrings should work.

3376
04:10:35,547 --> 04:10:36,801
LAURA: I'm sorry.

3377
04:10:36,801 --> 04:10:38,691
SAM: We don't need to talk.

3378
04:10:38,691 --> 04:10:45,306
LAURA: 28. No, 29 perception.

3379
04:10:45,306 --> 04:10:54,136
MATT: 29? All right. You notice, on the outskirts
of like the central row of scales, there is a

3380
04:10:54,136 --> 04:10:58,731
small lump that is constantly struggling not far
from the surface and is just darting around like a

3381
04:10:58,731 --> 04:11:00,151
cartoon flea.

3382
04:11:00,151 --> 04:11:13,727
LAURA: I'm going to aim right by there. But not
quite at it. I want to make an opening around it.

3383
04:11:13,727 --> 04:11:16,476
MATT: All right. Roll for it.

3384
04:11:16,476 --> 04:11:29,516
LIAM: Man, remember when we used to do hopscotch?
That was the best. And then also we used to take

3385
04:11:29,516 --> 04:11:33,477
baths together when we were really little, but
that was when we were really little--

3386
04:11:33,477 --> 04:11:35,750
LAURA: 20. Doesn't hit.

3387
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:37,431
MATT: 20, it hits and shatters--

3388
04:11:37,431 --> 04:11:42,384
ASHLEY: Can I use War God's Blessing again? I use
it every turn. Every round.

3389
04:11:42,384 --> 04:11:48,350
MATT: I think it's a Channel Divinity, in which
case I don't think you can. War God's Blessing,

3390
04:11:48,350 --> 04:12:00,956
Channel Divinity-- Which currently-- You can use
it a second time between rests. Yeah. So you can.

3391
04:12:00,956 --> 04:12:02,168
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

3392
04:12:02,168 --> 04:12:04,032
MATT: So that does hit.

3393
04:12:04,032 --> 04:12:05,154
LAURA: Oh, it hits?

3394
04:12:05,154 --> 04:12:06,510
MATT: Plus ten to the attack, so it hits.

3395
04:12:06,510 --> 04:12:07,881
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

3396
04:12:07,881 --> 04:12:11,503
TRAVIS: Pike!

3397
04:12:11,503 --> 04:12:12,953
LIAM: Vex'ahlia--

3398
04:12:12,953 --> 04:12:14,501
LAURA: Ten damage.

3399
04:12:14,501 --> 04:12:18,353
MATT: Let's see here, what's the range on that
one?

3400
04:12:18,353 --> 04:12:19,920
MARISHA: He's consulting the book again.

3401
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:23,609
MATT: Just checking to see the range on that last
because it does have a range--

3402
04:12:23,609 --> 04:12:28,442
LAURA: He's getting my hopes up and then he's
going to dash them down to the ground.

3403
04:12:28,442 --> 04:12:31,855
MATT: It's what I do. Creature within 30 feet of
you makes an attack roll, so you could not,

3404
04:12:31,855 --> 04:12:33,155
unfortunately.

3405
04:12:33,155 --> 04:12:34,259
ASHLEY: What was that, say again?

3406
04:12:34,259 --> 04:12:38,259
MATT: Has to be within 30 feet of you. She's too
far away. So that one does miss, shatters across

3407
04:12:38,259 --> 04:12:44,815
the armor of the dragon. You have one more attack
and then your extra if you want to.

3408
04:12:44,815 --> 04:12:54,817
LAURA: That one doesn't work either. (mock-crying)
Okay, that's good. 23!

3409
04:12:54,817 --> 04:12:57,314
MATT: 23 hits.

3410
04:12:57,314 --> 04:13:01,395
LAURA: Okay. 11.

3411
04:13:01,395 --> 04:13:03,048
MATT: 11 points of damage.

3412
04:13:03,048 --> 04:13:04,442
SAM: Yeah, he's dead!

3413
04:13:04,442 --> 04:13:07,047
LAURA: How do I want to do this?

3414
04:13:07,047 --> 04:13:10,160
(laughter)

3415
04:13:10,160 --> 04:13:12,906
MATT: You can't summon it yourself.

3416
04:13:12,906 --> 04:13:14,123
LAURA: Dammit!

3417
04:13:14,123 --> 04:13:21,766
MATT: Sticks into and pierces through. You feel a
(impact sound) nearby. And what little bit of

3418
04:13:21,766 --> 04:13:25,359
vision you have in the squeezed area, dark as it
is using your elven darkvision, you can see what

3419
04:13:25,359 --> 04:13:29,854
looks to be a part of an arrow point that has
stuck through the armor.

3420
04:13:29,854 --> 04:13:31,765
LIAM: I wrap my fingers around it.

3421
04:13:31,765 --> 04:13:33,619
MATT: Okay. Ends Vex's turn.

3422
04:13:33,619 --> 04:13:35,886
SAM: You don't know if it's Vex's. It could be
anybody's!

3423
04:13:35,886 --> 04:13:37,754
LIAM: Shut the fuck up, gnome!

3424
04:13:37,754 --> 04:13:49,959
MATT: At this point, Zanror looks over to Worra
and says, "We have to go. Save our child." And

3425
04:13:49,959 --> 04:13:57,768
Worra looks and sees all the dead around her.
"Only if you come with me." Looks back and says,

3426
04:13:57,768 --> 04:14:07,206
"No. I don't run from this. I'm going to kill this
with my cousin." She turns and goes into a full

3427
04:14:07,206 --> 04:14:19,219
dash this way, escaping. This guy's going to go
ahead and begin to climb up. And gets partway up.

3428
04:14:19,219 --> 04:14:28,049
Not all the way. Take a step back and make four
arrow shots at it. That's a hit, a miss, a miss,

3429
04:14:28,049 --> 04:14:40,209
and a miss. Takes an additional ten points of
damage from the arrow. That guy over there is

3430
04:14:40,209 --> 04:14:46,869
going to move around and he's going to grab one of
the dropped chains on the ground and throw it up

3431
04:14:46,869 --> 04:14:52,077
to see if it can wrap around Umbrasyl. Seven does
not hit. It just arcs below and falls to the

3432
04:14:52,077 --> 04:14:55,793
ground. That's going to end the Herd's turn. Grog,
you're up.

3433
04:14:55,793 --> 04:15:03,941
TRAVIS: Still hasted. Can I stand up?

3434
04:15:03,941 --> 04:15:06,610
MATT: Okay, so 50 feet.

3435
04:15:06,610 --> 04:15:13,865
TRAVIS: And with the Titanstone Knuckles, can I
smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself?

3436
04:15:13,865 --> 04:15:18,189
(cheering)

3437
04:15:18,189 --> 04:15:22,167
TRAVIS: How tall am I?

3438
04:15:22,167 --> 04:15:26,148
MATT: You are twice your size, so you're pushing
about 12 feet.

3439
04:15:26,148 --> 04:15:30,551
LAURA: He's only six feet tall?

3440
04:15:30,551 --> 04:15:32,096
MARISHA: He's gotta be taller than six feet.

3441
04:15:32,096 --> 04:15:35,688
MATT: It's roughly half your height, not
perfect--

3442
04:15:35,688 --> 04:15:38,293
LIAM: You're 15 feet tall now, Grog.

3443
04:15:38,293 --> 04:15:40,125
LAURA: Yeah, 20 feet, you're probably 20 feet.

3444
04:15:40,125 --> 04:15:43,004
MARISHA: 15 sounds nicer. Rounds up.

3445
04:15:43,004 --> 04:15:44,544
MATT: Don't argue with the DM.

3446
04:15:44,544 --> 04:15:46,314
MARISHA: I'm not arguing, we're rounding up.

3447
04:15:46,314 --> 04:15:49,704
LIAM: You're like two feet tall now and it's
really impressive.

3448
04:15:49,704 --> 04:15:56,352
TRAVIS: Being that I'm hasted, can I move directly
behind Umbrasyl, like underneath him and behind?

3449
04:15:56,352 --> 04:16:03,192
And can I attach the chain of returning to the
Bloodaxe--

3450
04:16:03,192 --> 04:16:05,650
MATT: I assume it was attached before the battle.

3451
04:16:05,650 --> 04:16:13,011
TRAVIS: Yes. And can I throw it at Umbrasyl?

3452
04:16:13,011 --> 04:16:14,062
MATT: Go for it.

3453
04:16:14,062 --> 04:16:15,720
TRAVIS: Do I have four? No, I just have one
throw.

3454
04:16:15,720 --> 04:16:18,544
MATT: You have one throw. It hits and then you can
pull it back.

3455
04:16:18,544 --> 04:16:19,678
TRAVIS: If I want to.

3456
04:16:19,678 --> 04:16:20,543
MATT: Yes.

3457
04:16:20,543 --> 04:16:21,331
TRAVIS: Reckless.

3458
04:16:21,331 --> 04:16:22,376
MATT: Yes.

3459
04:16:22,376 --> 04:16:26,047
TRAVIS: That's even better. 29.

3460
04:16:26,047 --> 04:16:28,186
MATT: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3461
04:16:28,186 --> 04:16:41,244
TRAVIS: 21. With one point of necrotic damage.

3462
04:16:41,244 --> 04:16:46,917
MATT: 21 points of damage onto Umbrasyl. All
righty. It is embedded in there. Do you want to

3463
04:16:46,917 --> 04:16:48,200
pull back?

3464
04:16:48,200 --> 04:16:52,175
TRAVIS: I don't want to pull it loose. I just want
to weigh on it.

3465
04:16:52,175 --> 04:16:58,207
MATT: Okay, you weigh. All right. At the end of
your turn, it's going to go ahead and make a tail

3466
04:16:58,207 --> 04:17:05,248
attack against one of the eagles. That is going to
be a 21 to hit.

3467
04:17:05,248 --> 04:17:07,735
LAURA: I bet that hits.

3468
04:17:07,735 --> 04:17:15,567
MATT: The giant eagle takes 20 points of
bludgeoning damage.

3469
04:17:15,567 --> 04:17:17,192
LAURA: I'm sure that probably kills him.

3470
04:17:17,192 --> 04:17:18,340
MARISHA: He has 26 hit points.

3471
04:17:18,340 --> 04:17:19,800
LAURA: He's got six points left.

3472
04:17:19,800 --> 04:17:21,928
MATT: Okay, so the eagle right there has six hit
points left.

3473
04:17:21,928 --> 04:17:24,444
TRAVIS: Does enlarging do anything to my damage?
Sorry.

3474
04:17:24,444 --> 04:17:26,913
MATT: You do an additional 1d4 damage with any
melee attacks.

3475
04:17:26,913 --> 04:17:28,538
TRAVIS: I didn't do that. Can I do that?

3476
04:17:28,538 --> 04:17:33,275
MATT: Melee attacks. Although the weapon does grow
large. I'll say go ahead and do another 1d4.

3477
04:17:33,275 --> 04:17:35,351
TRAVIS: Hey, four!

3478
04:17:35,351 --> 04:17:40,271
MATT: There you go. So that's an additional four
damage. Great. So that's the eagles' turn. What do

3479
04:17:40,271 --> 04:17:41,413
you got, Laura?

3480
04:17:41,413 --> 04:17:43,921
LAURA: They're going to fly and attack his
eyeballs! Fuck him up.

3481
04:17:43,921 --> 04:17:45,311
ASHLEY: Get him!

3482
04:17:45,311 --> 04:17:49,406
MATT: Roll attack, they have two attacks each, so
roll four attacks.

3483
04:17:49,406 --> 04:17:51,065
LAURA: Roll four attacks?

3484
04:17:51,065 --> 04:17:52,674
MATT: Yes. Plus five to each.

3485
04:17:52,674 --> 04:17:57,344
LIAM: That one hits.

3486
04:17:57,344 --> 04:17:59,632
LAURA: That's good. That hits. That one doesn't.

3487
04:17:59,632 --> 04:18:01,446
MATT: 23 hits.

3488
04:18:01,446 --> 04:18:07,403
LAURA: Ooh! Then one other attack hits.

3489
04:18:07,403 --> 04:18:10,212
MATT: So two hits. All right. So that is--

3490
04:18:10,212 --> 04:18:14,933
LAURA: So those would be, like, one beak and one
talon maybe?

3491
04:18:14,933 --> 04:18:22,154
MATT: It would be one beak and one talon, yeah. Go
for it. So 1d6 plus three and then 2d6 plus three.

3492
04:18:22,154 --> 04:18:26,004
LAURA: Nine for one on the eyeballs.

3493
04:18:26,004 --> 04:18:31,065
MATT: Nice.

3494
04:18:31,065 --> 04:18:33,874
LAURA: And eight on the talons.

3495
04:18:33,874 --> 04:18:41,044
MATT: Not bad. Both streaking out and clawing
heavily at the dragon. It's bothered by it very

3496
04:18:41,044 --> 04:18:43,968
remotely. It's more distracted with the sharp pain
in its stomach.

3497
04:18:43,968 --> 04:18:45,612
LAURA: Eyeballs.

3498
04:18:45,612 --> 04:18:49,912
MATT: Well yeah, I mean, they're striking at it,
they don't go straight for the eyeballs, the

3499
04:18:49,912 --> 04:18:54,414
dragon goes here, hit. They're getting near it and
scraping it, the scales around it, it's moving its

3500
04:18:54,414 --> 04:18:58,969
horns around and batting them away. If you wanted
to make called shots for its eyes specifically,

3501
04:18:58,969 --> 04:19:06,059
none of those would've hit. Outside of a natural
20, none of them would've hit. And even a dragon's

3502
04:19:06,059 --> 04:19:09,628
eyes have pretty decent armor.

3503
04:19:09,628 --> 04:19:11,876
LAURA: That's cool, okay, good to know.

3504
04:19:11,876 --> 04:19:16,555
MATT: So Percy, you're up. Oh, we've lost audio on
Percy.

3505
04:19:16,555 --> 04:19:17,652
LAURA: Oh no!

3506
04:19:17,652 --> 04:19:19,337
SAM: Text us your move.

3507
04:19:19,337 --> 04:19:22,172
TALIESIN: No, I'm good.

3508
04:19:22,172 --> 04:19:25,828
MATT: What are you doing?

3509
04:19:25,828 --> 04:19:30,487
TALIESIN: All right. I'm taking two shots. That's
all I got left.

3510
04:19:30,487 --> 04:19:32,164
MATT: All right. Go for it.

3511
04:19:32,164 --> 04:19:39,092
TALIESIN: Here we go. 23?

3512
04:19:39,092 --> 04:19:40,664
MATT: 23 hits.

3513
04:19:40,664 --> 04:20:00,088
TALIESIN: Ah! Hm. Ah. Okay. That's, eee, (broken
audio).

3514
04:20:00,088 --> 04:20:04,761
TRAVIS: Say that again, Perce.

3515
04:20:04,761 --> 04:20:07,903
TALIESIN: 20, 24 points of damage.

3516
04:20:07,903 --> 04:20:09,062
MATT: Nice.

3517
04:20:09,062 --> 04:20:11,618
TALIESIN: Six of which are necrotic. I'm taking my
second shot.

3518
04:20:11,618 --> 04:20:14,113
MATT: All right. Reload, second shot.

3519
04:20:14,113 --> 04:20:23,716
TALIESIN: Reload, fire. Fuck my life. That's
m--(audio glitches)

3520
04:20:23,716 --> 04:20:27,761
MATT: Misfire? Oh no. Bad News just (muffled
explosion).

3521
04:20:27,761 --> 04:20:29,910
TALIESIN: Putting it away, pulling out the other
gun.

3522
04:20:29,910 --> 04:20:32,548
MATT: All right, so that's the end of your turn?

3523
04:20:32,548 --> 04:20:34,468
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

3524
04:20:34,468 --> 04:20:44,999
MATT: All right. Noja actually is getting scared,
yeah. Noja is actually hiding behind the tree and

3525
04:20:44,999 --> 04:20:50,453
is shaking now, his body, malnourishment that
whole time and this dragon taking all of these

3526
04:20:50,453 --> 04:20:58,605
blows and is still standing has gotten to his head.
Umbrasyl is going to look around in the vicinity,

3527
04:20:58,605 --> 04:21:07,665
you know, starting to show some wear and tear and
some serious damage to it now. And it's going to

3528
04:21:07,665 --> 04:21:14,312
go into a dive. As it does so, you watch as the
rod hits the edge of the body and tears through

3529
04:21:14,312 --> 04:21:15,556
the stomach.

3530
04:21:15,556 --> 04:21:16,589
LIAM: Damage.

3531
04:21:16,589 --> 04:21:21,857
MATT: And tears through the abdomen and out the
side of it. The immovable rod now shoots out the

3532
04:21:21,857 --> 04:21:23,252
side of its body.

3533
04:21:23,252 --> 04:21:25,109
MARISHA: That's going to be a lot of damage,
right?

3534
04:21:25,109 --> 04:21:26,813
LIAM: That's a fuckin' missile.

3535
04:21:26,813 --> 04:21:41,097
MATT: That is 37 points of piercing damage as it
ejects from the side. He is going to--

3536
04:21:41,097 --> 04:21:42,909
TRAVIS: I'm still attached to him, too.

3537
04:21:42,909 --> 04:21:49,371
MATT: Correct. As you are pulled up, let's see
here.

3538
04:21:49,371 --> 04:21:51,712
TRAVIS: I'm going for a ride.

3539
04:21:51,712 --> 04:21:53,893
MARISHA: We burned through all of his legendary
saves.

3540
04:21:53,893 --> 04:21:57,146
SAM: One more.

3541
04:21:57,146 --> 04:21:59,045
LIAM: You're attached to him? By a chain?

3542
04:21:59,045 --> 04:22:00,500
TRAVIS: Yup.

3543
04:22:00,500 --> 04:22:04,199
MATT: You, Grog, are now being lifted up. Make a
strength check.

3544
04:22:04,199 --> 04:22:11,963
TRAVIS: Advantage on this. 24.

3545
04:22:11,963 --> 04:22:20,413
MATT: 24, yeah. Umbrasyl lifts up and goes full
flying speed of 80 feet this way, carrying you

3546
04:22:20,413 --> 04:22:29,713
dangling beneath and is going to go into a dash
and continue to fly up towards Gatshadow.

3547
04:22:29,713 --> 04:22:33,548
SAM: (terrified laughter)

3548
04:22:33,548 --> 04:22:34,969
LIAM: He's scared.

3549
04:22:34,969 --> 04:22:40,353
MATT: With Scanlan and Vax inside him still.

3550
04:22:40,353 --> 04:22:42,546
LIAM: Work that broom, girl!

3551
04:22:42,546 --> 04:22:49,820
MATT: Grog dangling from beneath. And that's where
we're going to pick up the next one.

3552
04:22:49,820 --> 04:22:52,088
(yelling)

3553
04:22:52,088 --> 04:22:53,768
MATT: It's midnight!

3554
04:22:53,768 --> 04:22:58,070
TRAVIS: Three of us are not here next week.

3555
04:22:58,070 --> 04:23:01,114
MATT: Three of you are not here-- That's right. Do
you guys want to keep going then?

3556
04:23:01,114 --> 04:23:02,109
LIAM: Yes!

3557
04:23:02,109 --> 04:23:04,509
TRAVIS: It's either that or--

3558
04:23:04,509 --> 04:23:06,961
MATT: Or you're going to have to wait two weeks.

3559
04:23:06,961 --> 04:23:08,455
TRAVIS: We're not here.

3560
04:23:08,455 --> 04:23:10,168
LAURA: What do you guys think? Would you rather
wait two weeks?

3561
04:23:10,168 --> 04:23:11,270
LIAM: I want to go.

3562
04:23:11,270 --> 04:23:13,215
LAURA: I mean, this is you guys, too. You guys
have to stay.

3563
04:23:13,215 --> 04:23:16,920
SAM: You want to go, keep going?

3564
04:23:16,920 --> 04:23:18,292
LIAM: Keep going.

3565
04:23:18,292 --> 04:23:19,577
SAM: It could be a long night.

3566
04:23:19,577 --> 04:23:20,737
ASHLEY: Who's not here next week?

3567
04:23:20,737 --> 04:23:22,376
TRAVIS: Laura, Travis, and Sam.

3568
04:23:22,376 --> 04:23:25,626
MATT: Yeah, we're probably going to take off next
week because we're missing half the party.

3569
04:23:25,626 --> 04:23:29,327
SAM: Oh, so we'll just skip next week and come
back in two weeks.

3570
04:23:29,327 --> 04:23:31,629
LIAM: No, it's on us, because we have jobs and
getting up in the morning.

3571
04:23:31,629 --> 04:23:33,318
MATT: Yeah, we have work tomorrow.

3572
04:23:33,318 --> 04:23:36,078
SAM: Why don't we skip next week and come back in
two weeks to finish?

3573
04:23:36,078 --> 04:23:39,392
LAURA: I feel like that's smarter.

3574
04:23:39,392 --> 04:23:40,898
MATT: All right, let's do that.

3575
04:23:40,898 --> 04:23:43,004
LIAM: You're leaving me in this thing's anus for
two weeks?

3576
04:23:43,004 --> 04:23:46,311
TRAVIS: That 30 minutes fucked us.

3577
04:23:46,311 --> 04:23:48,189
MATT: Picking up in two weeks from now.

3578
04:23:48,189 --> 04:23:50,067
(yelling)

3579
04:23:50,067 --> 04:23:51,865
MARISHA: This is awful.

3580
04:23:51,865 --> 04:23:53,351
SAM: The worst cliffhanger ever.

3581
04:23:53,351 --> 04:24:01,508
MATT: We have the remnants of the Herd and most
of Vox Machina left behind as Umbrasyl flies off

3582
04:24:01,508 --> 04:24:13,974
to the peaks of Gatshadow, dragging a large
chain-held Grog beneath and a miniaturized Vax and

3583
04:24:13,974 --> 04:24:16,466
Scanlan inside of its body.

3584
04:24:16,466 --> 04:24:22,003
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm holding an arrow that's half
in and out of the dragon. So I've got a little

3585
04:24:22,003 --> 04:24:23,219
tunnel out.

3586
04:24:23,219 --> 04:24:24,612
MARISHA: Make a little breathing hole?

3587
04:24:24,612 --> 04:24:27,491
SAM: I see a hole that goes to the outside now.

3588
04:24:27,491 --> 04:24:29,166
TRAVIS: It's the shaft of an arrow.

3589
04:24:29,166 --> 04:24:35,929
TALIESIN: This is chaos. I will see you guys
later. I can't hear anything.

3590
04:24:35,929 --> 04:24:38,607
MARISHA: Bye, Taliesin! We love you!

3591
04:24:38,607 --> 04:24:45,453
MATT: Oh man, this is going to get real
interesting.

3592
04:24:45,453 --> 04:24:51,340
SAM: How are we going to survive two weeks
thinking about this? I know what we'll do! We'll

3593
04:24:51,340 --> 04:25:02,610
subscribe to Loot Crate and we'll find all sorts
of things to keep us-- We'll be able to play with

3594
04:25:02,610 --> 04:25:04,404
new toys and drink from--

3595
04:25:04,404 --> 04:25:07,668
(laughing)

3596
04:25:07,668 --> 04:25:10,048
TRAVIS: Made me drop my fucking jelly bean.

3597
04:25:10,048 --> 04:25:18,035
LAURA: That went south. That went seriously
south.

3598
04:25:18,035 --> 04:25:19,585
SAM: We're not doing well.

3599
04:25:19,585 --> 04:25:21,316
TRAVIS: We're doing great.

3600
04:25:21,316 --> 04:25:24,254
MATT: You guys did pretty good. Dragon's taken
some damage.

3601
04:25:24,254 --> 04:25:26,923
LIAM: Is it two Thursdays from now yet?

3602
04:25:26,923 --> 04:25:33,620
MATT: No, but it will be soon. All right, guys.
We'll figure out what we're doing next Thursday.

3603
04:25:33,620 --> 04:25:36,687
It might be another Q&amp;A hangout session for those
of us who are still in town.

3604
04:25:36,687 --> 04:25:37,981
LIAM: Son of a b.

3605
04:25:37,981 --> 04:25:39,749
ASHLEY: Why are you guys going?

3606
04:25:39,749 --> 04:25:44,507
MARISHA: Are you still going to be in Puerto Rico
that long? No?

3607
04:25:44,507 --> 04:25:45,856
TRAVIS: No.

3608
04:25:45,856 --> 04:25:52,001
MATT: They got birthday events and travel to do.
It's all good. We'll be back here in two weeks,

3609
04:25:52,001 --> 04:25:57,254
back here next week for probably a Q&amp;A hangout
session, two weeks from now with the dramatic

3610
04:25:57,254 --> 04:26:05,106
conclusion of the showdown with Umbrasyl the Hope
Devourer, member of the Chroma Conclave.

3611
04:26:05,106 --> 04:26:10,398
LIAM: Matt, if you were wondering what to get me
for my birthday, it's to kill my character in two weeks.

3612
04:26:10,398 --> 04:26:13,378
LAURA: No! That is so terrible. Don't say that.

3613
04:26:13,378 --> 04:26:14,813
MATT: (laughs) That's awful.

3614
04:26:14,813 --> 04:26:16,246
MARISHA: Such a death wish.

3615
04:26:16,246 --> 04:26:17,296
LIAM: Kill me.

3616
04:26:17,296 --> 04:26:18,209
LAURA: No.

3617
04:26:18,209 --> 04:26:21,448
MARISHA: Hope Devourer. Maiden name Hope. Maiden
name Hope.

3618
04:26:21,448 --> 04:26:25,777
LIAM: The dragon's name is Hope.

3619
04:26:25,777 --> 04:26:32,796
MATT: We'll see you in a few weeks? Well, some of
us will see you next week. Rest well, dream of

3620
04:26:32,796 --> 04:26:47,114
flying dragons digesting smaller people. (laughs)
See you guys soon. Is it Thursday yet? Good night.
