00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:14,361
actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.
(heavy sigh) Every goddamn week. Anyway! Before we

3
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:17,415
jump into the craziness of tonight's episode,
let's get through some quick announcements, here!

4
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,918
First and foremost, merch update. Laura, what do
we got?

5
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:28,308
LAURA: Well, those amazing David Mack posters that
are only on sale-- well, okay, here's the thing.

6
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:35,559
The <i>signed</i> ones are only available for one more
day; they're going away tomorrow, forever and ever

7
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:42,093
and ever, amen. After that, the not-signed version
will be available for one more week, and then

8
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:48,743
those are gone forever and ever, amen. So if you
want them, you should get them. We also have a

9
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:53,623
bunch of other shirts, like the Scanlan t-shirt,
and the Vox Machina t-shirt, and every other

10
00:00:53,623 --> 00:01:00,105
t-shirt that are so soft and comfy and cozy. And
the Slayer's Cake apron!

11
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,857
MATT: They're shipping soon, right?

12
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:07,059
LAURA: Those will be shipping soon. Those will be
shipping-- yeah, pretty soon. Pre-orders are still

13
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:12,294
available right now. With the posters-- I'm going
completely out of order-- with the signed ones,

14
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:18,717
it's going to take a few extra weeks to ship those
because we all have to sign them. Just be patient.

15
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:22,906
We love you, and you will get them! The ones that
aren't signed

16
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,768
will get shipped out a little bit faster.

17
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,837
SAM: So one day for those.

18
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,213
LAURA: One more day! (singing) One!

19
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:35,226
MARISHA: Tell your friends! Tell your wives!

20
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:44,131
MATT: Perfect. Next update, we have Wednesday Club
for next week.

21
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:49,506
TALIESIN: Wednesday Club! We're in an interesting
transition point for a lot of shows on Geek and

22
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:54,227
Sundry, so we thought we'd have a card party. It's
not as sexy as it sounds.

23
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,942
MATT: I disagree, sir!

24
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,668
TALIESIN: Are you in? Are you down?

25
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:58,863
MATT: Yeah, I am!

26
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:01,208
TALIESIN: We're opening card packs!

27
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,990
MATT: I'm going to be there for this!

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,782
TALIESIN: Matt Mercer is going to join us for the
Wednesday Club. We may have a few other guests.

29
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,366
You want to come?

30
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,975
LAURA: Can we all come and open card packs?

31
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,599
LIAM: Will you also someday have a Pog episode?

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,038
TALIESIN: We already did a Pog episode.

33
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,423
LIAM: Shut your mouth!

34
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:20,428
TALIESIN: We actually made it rain Pogs! It was
great! You can come. We're going to have another

35
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,645
Pog party!

36
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:24,623
SAM: You'll have lots of time after this,
Liam!

37
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:33,720
TALIESIN: Since the show is moving to its new
time, 7:00-9:00pm, so we're going to be opening

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,919
card packs. Talking about them, being really dumb
and in our pajamas, and it's going to be great.

39
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,560
Definitely Matt, and there's going to be a bunch
of people showing up; it's going to be great!

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,421
MATT: That's so much of my childhood, you have no
idea.

41
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,009
LIAM: What kind of cards?

42
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:58,357
TALIESIN: We're confirmed with some Jim Lee X-Men
Series One. We're confirmed with some Superman vs.

43
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,572
Doomsday cards.

44
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,459
MATT: Any Marvel Masterpiece?

45
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:08,896
TALIESIN: We're working on Marvel Masterpiece.
Unopened. We've got some Kirby cards, some classic

46
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:14,764
Avengers cards. We're doing a little bit of
everything. We've got a couple we're working on,

47
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:18,516
though. Marvel Universe Series One of Three is
what we're really working on.

48
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:23,451
MATT: I'll talk more about it on the show, but I
have a long history with those cards. All righty!

49
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:30,023
Thank you, Taliesin! Signal Boost, I believe we
had our recent episode went up this week with our

50
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:32,047
fantastic Ashley Johnson!

51
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,939
(cheering)

52
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,613
LAURA: It was so good!

53
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,906
MARISHA: Boosting Taliesin!

54
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:43,160
LIAM: Taliesin, you looked taller in that Signal
Boost.

55
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,382
TALIESIN: I was wearing smaller people on my feet,
so it helped.

56
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:52,317
MATT: He learned from the last episode, if you
stack them in a trenchcoat.

57
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,784
LIAM: I just thought of four people that fit that
bill and decided not to say any of their names.

58
00:03:55,784 --> 00:04:00,906
ASHLEY: We had been planning for that episode, I
remember talking to Marisha. I was like, I kind of

59
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:05,363
want to boost Taliesin. We were like, everybody
knows who Taliesin is.

60
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:10,046
TALIESIN: Over half those facts at the beginning
are actually true.

61
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,319
Even if they've been goosed a bit.

62
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,751
MARISHA: They're peppered in between. The beauty
of that is you're not sure which ones are true and

63
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:24,603
which ones aren't! They're back and forth. The
bees are true.

64
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,342
TALIESIN: The bees are true.

65
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,531
MATT: Two more people have to die before you
eventually become

66
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,286
the most interesting man in the world.

67
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:32,549
TALIESIN: One now.

68
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,595
MATT: One now? That's right.

69
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,835
TALIESIN: That's dark, but that's where we are.

70
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:41,205
LIAM: The guy who's running Canada is very young,
so we're going to have to wait a while.

71
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:48,270
MATT: Last but not least. Couple things. Talks
Machina, every Tuesday, 7:00pm Pacific Time here

72
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,585
on Twitch and Alpha with our fantastic Brian
Foster, talk about this episode next-- no, not

73
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:55,728
next week, we're off next week because it's 4th of
July. We'll talk about this episode and next

74
00:04:55,728 --> 00:05:03,176
episode on Talks two weeks from now. We'll see you
then. Today, the Sagas of Sundry: Dread went up.

75
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:09,482
Which we're super excited about. For those who
were here for International Tabletop day, Ivan van

76
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:16,996
Norman ran me, Taliesin, Satine Phoenix, Amy
Dallen, Amy Vorpahl through a very intense game of

77
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:23,944
Dread, all being late 80s, early 90s high school
kids going up to a cabin experience, and it was

78
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:28,430
awesome. Well, we made a show! It was amazing.

79
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,083
TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's so good!

80
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:35,976
MATT: It's genuinely one of the coolest
experiences I've ever had as a player in a game.

81
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:39,412
MARISHA: I feel like we invented a new form of
theater; it's weird.

82
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:44,612
MATT: If you have the opportunity, it's on Alpha.
If you have Alpha, go check it out. If you don't

83
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:51,207
have Alpha, there's a 60-day free trial code.
What's the code?

84
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,215
MARISHA: SHIPMATES.

85
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,220
MATT: SHIPMATES.

86
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,839
TALIESIN: Only today, though. Today's the last
day.

87
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,189
MARISHA: Until tomorrow.

88
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,392
MATT: You have until tomorrow to try it out, so if
you're like, "I don't want to pay for Alpha!"

89
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,543
Well, you don't have to for 60 days now! Just put
SHIPMATES in, and you'll be fine.

90
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:06,951
TALIESIN: This is the first time I've ever said
this out loud: Seriously, go check out Alpha for

91
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,781
this show. It's worth it. It's amazing. Oh my
god!

92
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:13,932
MARISHA: Adam Lawson was the director. Sean and I
were the producers.

93
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,706
TRAVIS: Is there any nudity?

94
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:23,635
TALIESIN: Yes, but probably not any you're going
to be happy with. To be fair. I may make a post

95
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:26,930
later on Twitter tomorrow or something to really
talk about it.

96
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,762
I have a lot of feelings about this show.

97
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,651
LIAM: What's on your mind, Sam?

98
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:38,172
SAM: Nothing. The power's out at my house! Just
distracted because I just came from my house, and

99
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:42,860
the power was out, that's all. I'm worried about
my kids. Are they going to have their little fans

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,207
on tonight to keep them cool? Are they going to
light candles in their room? I don't know!

101
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,081
TALIESIN: Are they watching Twitch by
candlelight?

102
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:54,281
SAM: They are definitely watching Twitch.

103
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:58,322
LAURA: Can they have a pillow fort in the living
room?

104
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:01,299
SAM: Maybe, if they can find the living room. It's
<i>dark</i>!

105
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:08,006
TALIESIN: Just hear the sound of a wine aerator in
the background.

106
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:13,025
SAM: Oh yeah, they have their wine aerator. They
each have their cell phones. They're okay.

107
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,633
(laughter)

108
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,628
SAM: They aerate their milk.

109
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:26,258
MATT: That would be the worst sound. (bubbling
milk sound) Anyway, that's enough of that,

110
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:30,095
guys. Anyway. That's the end of our announcements.
And as such,

111
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:36,525
that brings us to tonight's episode of 
Critical Role.

112
00:07:36,525 --> 00:09:07,402
[music]

113
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,858
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical
Role. Hope you liked our new intro, apparently. I

114
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:15,728
guess they're having some tech issues trying to
get the regular intro showing tonight. Little

115
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:23,709
change for the evening. No biggie, mix it up a
little bit. Anyway, so last we left off. Vox

116
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:31,408
Machina, after discovering that the various siphon
orbs, the one that was beneath Whitestone was one

117
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:37,145
of many, and apparently were funneling magical
energies from various arcane ley lines that exist

118
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:41,699
across Exandria into some plane other than the
Prime Material.

119
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:47,556
Through research and discovery, you found that
this plane was the Shadowfell. Upon traversing

120
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:53,142
this barrier and dealing with some cultists of the
Whispered One, you discovered that Delilah

121
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:59,049
Briarwood was still alive, and that there was a city in
the Shadowfell beyond the boundary of these

122
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:04,623
siphons known as Thar Amphala, an ancient city
that had seen an ancient battle, but much had been

123
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:11,135
rebuilt and constructed. There, in the center of
the town, was the dark tower called Entropis.

124
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:17,465
Where, apparently, the Whispered One, Vecna, or
something involved in a ritual was being

125
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:23,160
completed. You began to make your way through this
city, averting any sort of attention from most of

126
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,559
the denizens in the sky and below. You squashed
heads of a few cultists on the way, masqueraded as

127
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:38,680
cultists, masqueraded as undead! Found the city
itself shift strangely, using technology of the

128
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,135
threshold crests that Syngorn uses, it transported
itself out of the Shadowfell and somewhere else,

129
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:52,860
where it began to snow. You made your way to the
central tower, and deciding not to ascend it, took

130
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,122
it to the ground with some Earthquake spells.
However, due to the magical defenses of the tower

131
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:07,663
top, where the rituals were being completed, it
seems the top of the tower was untouched by the

132
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:15,313
spells, and lowered itself to the rubble of where
it once stood. You then mustered your forces, rode

133
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:23,377
up to the top of the lip of what remains of
Entropis and joined in battle against Delilah

134
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:33,410
Briarwood, a death knight, and the physical form
of Vecna, the Whispered One himself. However, the

135
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,793
battle did not turn in your favor, and in the
process of the battle--

136
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,290
TRAVIS: That's debatable.

137
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,000
LAURA: Is it?

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,128
MATT: In some degrees. 
Whether through bad luck or

139
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:49,402
not fully understanding
the scope of what you were up against, a number of

140
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:54,943
you fell in battle, with one of them not being
able to be restored, being Vax'ildan, who was

141
00:11:54,943 --> 00:12:01,126
reduced to dust by a Disintegration spell.
Realizing that your fortunes were failing, with

142
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:06,405
Grog banished to another dimension and only barely
returning in time, you joined hands and Keyleth

143
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:14,464
attempted to travel you out of the plane to
safety, of which Vecna attempted to stop with a

144
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:19,284
Counterspell, and Scanlan attempted to stop that
Counterspell with his own Counterspell, like a

145
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:24,507
bard is wont to do. So you successfully
transported, grabbing the corpse of Delilah

146
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:30,153
Briarwood, who Percival finished off with a shot
to the head. You found yourselves, last we left

147
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:38,886
off, emerging deep into a wooded forest in some
unknown location within the Feywild. Upon

148
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:43,458
arriving, and glancing about, to see that you're
still mostly intact, clutching the

149
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:50,264
no-longer-living corpse of Delilah behind you.
Vax, not with you,

150
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:52,410
and Vex, realizing, asked the question:

151
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,010
LAURA: Where's Vax?

152
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:09,014
SAM: I walk up to her and I set down his armor and
don't say anything.

153
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:14,250
LAURA: What's this? Where is he?!

154
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:23,976
SAM: There's nothing left. He was obliterated.

155
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,742
MARISHA: Disintegrated.

156
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:27,112
LAURA: What?!

157
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:34,160
MARISHA: I saw it happen, and then I saw it
happen.

158
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,707
LAURA: And we just left him there?!

159
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:39,554
MARISHA: No, we brought--

160
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,645
TALIESIN: We brought everything we could.

161
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:48,614
LAURA: Oh god! No!

162
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:50,803
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

163
00:13:50,803 --> 00:14:00,488
LAURA: I was brought back and his soul is just--
where?

164
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:05,494
MARISHA: That's the ultimate question, isn't it?

165
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:08,574
LAURA: Can you bring him back?

166
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:12,782
ASHLEY: I don't know if I can.

167
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:17,256
TALIESIN: Can you, Keyleth?

168
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:26,777
MARISHA: I've never done this before.

169
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:33,049
LAURA: I go over and gather up all of his armor
and start hugging it to myself.

170
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:47,941
MARISHA: I recently learned a spell that I could
attempt, but it's nothing I've tried before, and

171
00:14:47,941 --> 00:15:00,389
it's expensive, and I'm already terrified of the
fate and the hell that I might have brought him in

172
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,408
his final moments.

173
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:05,349
TRAVIS: Well, what is it?

174
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:19,726
MARISHA: I think he saw himself die. I think. I'm
so sorry.

175
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:23,171
LAURA: What are you talking about?

176
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:39,937
MARISHA: I cast Foresight on him. And I think
there was a thing for a second. I haven't thought

177
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,336
of those ramifications of something like that
before. I think he was held and there was nothing

178
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:49,914
he could do. What if that happened? What if he saw
himself die?

179
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:54,996
TALIESIN: Then it doesn't matter yet, until we
bring him back.

180
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,098
TRAVIS: Only matters what we do next, right?

181
00:15:57,098 --> 00:15:58,768
TALIESIN: Let's bring him back.

182
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:01,397
TRAVIS: What's this new spell you were talking
about?

183
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:06,630
MARISHA: I need 25,000 gold pieces worth of
diamonds.

184
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,710
TRAVIS: What?

185
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,639
MARISHA: I need 25--

186
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,605
LAURA: Not just gold, you need diamonds?

187
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:18,221
TALIESIN: Where are we?

188
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,168
LAURA: I don't have-- I don't have that!

189
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,956
MARISHA: We're in the Feywild.

190
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,489
TALIESIN: We can find it, then.

191
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:27,349
MATT: As you look around at this point, for the
first time really taking in the surroundings

192
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:36,462
around you, you find yourself deep in a shaded,
thick wood, where most of the leaves here are wide

193
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:43,253
and triangular in shape. Where you expect to see
deep greens, instead you see blues and purples.

194
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:49,565
You see the tips eventually coming to a midnight
blue at the edge. There's a very faint mist that

195
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:54,504
has gathered across the ground that stands about
knee-height. The ground beneath you seems to have

196
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:59,603
a somewhat crunchy sponginess to it with each
step, though you cannot see where your feet

197
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,147
actually touch the ground.

198
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:02,565
SAM: Is it all diamonds?

199
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:09,627
MATT: It is not all diamonds. You do hear the
ever-present echoing distant hooting of owls.

200
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,099
(owl hooting)

201
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:22,019
TALIESIN: Well, now we know what to do. We were
too late, and we have seen what we're up against,

202
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:29,893
and now we need to focus. We can't let it be over
yet. We need to focus.

203
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,840
We're going to find these diamonds.

204
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,008
LAURA: Was it her? Or was it Vecna?

205
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:44,001
SAM: It--

206
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:50,504
TALIESIN: Grog? Can you put her in the bag? And I
toss him the body.

207
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:56,637
MATT: As the body of Delilah Briarwood, the head
still scattered and divided right around the

208
00:17:56,637 --> 00:18:04,744
forehead, this giant cleft of her skull hemisphere
is gone. Whatever matter was once there has loosely

209
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:11,894
fallen out as she's been dragged from one
location. You do see the left eye, which is not

210
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:17,527
human, it seems, in appearance. The white is instead
a sickly greenish-yellow, and the pupil is a

211
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:24,410
cat-like slit of black, surrounded by a thin,
greenish-blue tint. As soon as you look down and

212
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,354
see the face, the eye which just looks upward at
nothing, the dead body still, the eye twitches and

213
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:33,128
shifts to look at you.

214
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:38,697
TRAVIS: Oh! (unhappy humming) Her fucking eye is
still moving.

215
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:41,243
ASHLEY: Should we take it out?

216
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,915
SAM: Yes. It could be Vecna, watching us.

217
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,150
TRAVIS: Does it look reptilian?

218
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:53,374
LAURA: Can you put it in a bag or something? Cover
it up?

219
00:18:53,374 --> 00:19:04,059
SAM: Wait, can I take a closer look at it and see
if I can, I don't know, identify it somehow?

220
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,818
MATT: Do you have an Identify spell?

221
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:07,642
SAM: No, but can I just see?

222
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:08,831
MATT: Make an arcana check.

223
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:14,488
SAM: Sure. Two! Plus five.

224
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:25,011
MATT: As you get down close to glance at the
rather disturbingly bloodied face of Delilah

225
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:29,634
Briarwood, the eye shifts back towards you. The
closer you get, you watch as the thinning slit of

226
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:39,656
the pupil seems to widen and focus on you. It's an
unsettling presence. As you try and concentrate to

227
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:47,029
see if there's any immediate signs of whether it
be sigils or arcane marks that would mark it to be

228
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:51,875
more of a magically enchanted object than an
actual organic eye, nothing comes to mind other

229
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,827
than the fact that it seems to be very intent on
studying you back.

230
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,089
SAM: Can I try to remove it from the ocular
cavity?

231
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,513
MATT: Using your fingers?

232
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:04,016
SAM: Yeah. My tiny, ocular hands.

233
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:07,922
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

234
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:13,025
SAM: Nine.

235
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:16,820
MATT: Okay, you (slurping).

236
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,610
SAM: I can inspire myself, I suppose.

237
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,659
MATT: If you want to. Up to you. How many more
bardic inspirations do you have after the battle?

238
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:27,106
SAM: Two, right? I didn't Cutting Words anyone.
Those count as inspiration, right?

239
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:35,023
MATT: Yeah. Your fingers are now knuckle-deep in
Delilah Briarwood's socket.

240
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:43,612
SAM: I'll inspire myself just to give it a serious
try. That's plus ten, so that's a 19 plus, I

241
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,911
guess, three for Jack of All Trades?

242
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,929
MATT: If you're not trained in it, then yeah.

243
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:49,174
SAM: 22.

244
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:57,128
MATT: You begin humming your favorite eye-pulling
song under your breath and with a horrible sucking

245
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:06,563
sound, you pull the eye from her socket, leaving
this trail of dark black and red viscera that

246
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:14,101
dangles from it loosely. As you pull it free,
whatever attached the eye to it seems to burn off

247
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:18,644
and fall, leaving just the circular socket. I also
need you to roll a wisdom saving throw.

248
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,327
SAM: Oh no! Insta-death.

249
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,926
TRAVIS: You're fine.

250
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:26,073
SAM: No, I'm not. Oh, is this magic?

251
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:31,082
MATT: It's not a magic spell, I'd say it's a magic
effect, yeah.

252
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,445
SAM: Do I get advantage?

253
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:35,389
MATT: I'll say, as a gnome, for this, yes, you
would.

254
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:40,679
SAM: Way better, but still terrible. 12!

255
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,048
LAURA: How bad was your first one?

256
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:45,449
SAM: A one!

257
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:54,744
MATT: So you watch as Scanlan pulls this eye out
and looks at it for a second. For you, it's less

258
00:21:54,744 --> 00:22:04,477
of an actual voice, but these images come to your
mind of all the terrible things that have happened

259
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:09,274
in your life: the loss of your mother, the
near-loss of Kaylie, the loss of your friends,

260
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:15,064
every person that's ever mattered to you, you've
seen slain before you or heard about. You could

261
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:22,908
stop that from ever happening again. All the
answers you could have. You would have the power

262
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:30,284
to prevent any of that from ever happening again.
And it's so simple. It's so simple!

263
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,139
LAURA: Could we smack the eye out of his hand?

264
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:38,080
MATT: As this is happening, you watch as he's
looking at it and this hand goes up and starts

265
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,047
clawing into his own eye socket.

266
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:46,546
TALIESIN: I'm going to use every dex I have. I'm
going to slap fucking hard.

267
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:51,743
MATT: Dex isn't going to help you so much as it's
going to be a strength thing. Go ahead and make an

268
00:22:51,743 --> 00:23:00,262
athletics check. For you, for this, this would be
an acrobatics to try and dodge out of the way.

269
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:05,065
TALIESIN: Strength check?

270
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:06,379
MATT: Athletics.

271
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,924
TALIESIN: Oh, athletics, that's better.

272
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:10,004
MATT: You're trying to slap it out of his grasp.

273
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:11,151
SAM: 13.

274
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:12,437
TALIESIN: 10.

275
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:19,492
MATT: You slap and the hand pulls back a little
bit and he yanks it back. You can see a trail of

276
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,652
blood beginning to pool out of the corner of the
eye.

277
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:30,928
ASHLEY: Can I try to grab his hand and slap him
across the face?

278
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:36,278
MATT: Yeah. This is the last chance anybody has to
try and do this or Scanlan loses an eye. We're

279
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:43,477
going into Event Horizon moment, here. Go ahead
and make an athletics check.

280
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:51,041
ASHLEY: 27.

281
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:55,877
MATT: Roll an acrobatics check.

282
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,129
SAM: It's the same thing, so it's 13.

283
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:04,882
MATT: As his fingers are digging into the socket
and the other eye's just staring at this piercing

284
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:11,160
circular gaze in his grasp in his right. You see
the blood beginning to trail down his face in two

285
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,905
different places. He's gotten his fingers partway
behind his own eye. You rush up and grab him by

286
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:21,972
the wrist, put your other hand right at the front
of his face, pushing his nose and cheek up. You

287
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:31,567
pull it back and you watch as, from behind the
eyelid, his fingers slip out. He's fighting it

288
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:36,087
with all his might. As you pull back, as soon as
you get it free, with your other hand, you

289
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:44,571
backhand. You knock the eye out of his other hand, and
it goes (falling noise)

290
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:46,385
and disappears beneath the mist.

291
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,070
LAURA: Can we see where it landed?

292
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,529
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to follow the eye.

293
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,171
MARISHA: Do not touch it, Percy!

294
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,929
SAM: Can I see?

295
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:59,593
MATT: The throbbing pain, and you're not able to
focus in this eye at the time. You're effectively

296
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:04,384
unable to see out of this eye really well until
your next long rest. It's pretty damaged just from

297
00:25:04,384 --> 00:25:12,890
the brief grabbing. You could try to heal him, if
you want. Your mind comes back to you for a

298
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,275
minute. You're like, "What the fuck is wrong with
me?!"

299
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,830
TRAVIS: What were you doing?!

300
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,142
SAM: It was speaking to me.

301
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,407
ASHLEY: What did it say?

302
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:22,996
SAM: I don't exactly remember, but it had some
really strong arguments.

303
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:27,888
TRAVIS: Was it telling you to pull your own
fucking eye out?

304
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:36,604
SAM: I guess, yeah. It was offering me things. It
was telling me it could help. I've never felt that

305
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:39,217
way before. It was amazing.

306
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:44,125
TRAVIS: Ew. Where did it go?

307
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,094
MATT: You said you were going to look in the mist
for it?

308
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,554
LAURA: No, I'm not. Just holding onto--

309
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,903
MATT: The remains of Vax.

310
00:25:52,903 --> 00:26:00,172
MARISHA: Keyleth goes over to Vex and curls up
into her.

311
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:05,331
MATT: 14. As you dive over in the direction of
where you think you saw it go, the mist is thick,

312
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:13,051
and you start pushing it away, and there is very
dense underbrush and foliage that is gathered here

313
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:19,574
that created the crunchy floor. Glancing through
and pushing around, there's no sign of the eye.

314
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:24,104
TALIESIN: I need help finding it. I need help! Be
very careful.

315
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:27,150
TRAVIS: I come over and start helping him look.

316
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,855
TALIESIN: I've got the flashlight box out, and I'm
going to try

317
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:36,383
and use this as a container if we find it.

318
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:43,102
MATT: Okay. You're not using the actual light,
you're using the box? The thickness in the mist

319
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,551
right now, the light would probably hinder your
search than help it.

320
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:53,112
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you thin this? We need to
see. Make the mist go away.

321
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,325
MARISHA: What?

322
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,122
TALIESIN: (louder) Can you make the mist go away?

323
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,606
MARISHA: I don't know.

324
00:26:57,606 --> 00:27:03,913
SAM: Can you try?

325
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:08,878
MARISHA: I half-heartedly do a Gust cantrip while
still sitting next to Vex.

326
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:15,010
MATT: You watch as some of the mist dissipates and
very quickly begins to roll back. The mist here is

327
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,231
almost aggressive in its need to fill the space.
Like a lot of things in the Feywild, it almost has

328
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:25,341
its own sense of nature and purpose. It's not
going to let someone push itself back if it wishes

329
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:29,875
to exist on the forest floor. As you're rushing in
to help, because you've already made the

330
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,863
investigation check and the mist is rolling in,
and based on his inability to find it, you're not

331
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:37,777
even quite sure where it landed. Make your own
investigation check, but you're at disadvantage.

332
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:46,441
TRAVIS: Okay. Hey, that's high! That's not.
Three.

333
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:52,012
MATT: Okay. Over the next three or four minutes,
as you guys pat through and tear roots apart and

334
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:56,853
sections of the forest floor, there is no sign of
where the eye landed.

335
00:27:56,853 --> 00:28:00,261
ASHLEY: If I were to cast Locate Object, would
that work?

336
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,587
MATT: You can certainly try.

337
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,081
ASHLEY: Okay!

338
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:14,068
MATT: You go over and grab your holy symbol and
kneel to the ground, focus on whatever this dark

339
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:21,293
relic is that seems to have plagued you in two
different ways in the past ten minutes. As you

340
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:26,416
concentrate, you feel the divine light of Sarenrae
come and restore warmth from the center of this

341
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:32,608
cold forest. You feel the energy flow through you
and the image of her face descending from

342
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:39,932
above, her mouth opening and she exhales this
breath over you, and as it does, you suddenly can

343
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:49,044
clarify your visual perception on this object. You
know exactly the direction it is. You start

344
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:54,270
walking in that direction. You push past Grog and
push past Percival. You find a portion of the

345
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,018
ground and you look, and it's not there, but you
know it's that direction.

346
00:28:57,018 --> 00:29:05,647
ASHLEY: I think I've located it. I can't see it,
but I know what direction it's in.

347
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:10,040
SAM: Is it beneath the ground? Is it invisible?

348
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:19,209
ASHLEY: I don't know. So it seems like it's in the
ground or it's been moved.

349
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:25,233
MATT: Trying to push aside the mist in the area,
and it's all closed in now. The Gust cantrip held

350
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,543
back what it could while you cast the spell.

351
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:33,811
MARISHA: I seem them moving in that direction, and
once again, poof for them.

352
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:38,761
MATT: The mist separates again. You look, and you
can see the direction where it would be, and as

353
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,772
you glance over and focus your attention, it looks
like between two of the roots, there's a portion

354
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:45,175
of fresh dirt.

355
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:49,775
SAM: It burrowed!

356
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:51,365
ASHLEY: Okay, can I start digging?

357
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:52,752
MATT: You start scooping in.

358
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,249
TALIESIN: I have the box out, ready.

359
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:59,056
MATT: About three inches down, you scoop down and
pull up a big handful of moist dirt and then

360
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:04,012
there, you watch as some of it falls away. You see
the wet exterior of the greenish-yellow eyeball.

361
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:12,230
It began to burrow. You see it glancing about. The
eye is flickering around like it's rapidly trying

362
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,278
to find a way out.

363
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,697
ASHLEY: I put it in the box.

364
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,826
MATT: You close the box.

365
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:19,479
SAM: I don't trust that thing.

366
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:23,548
TALIESIN: The burrowing eyeball? Are you <i>sure</i>?!

367
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:29,256
(laughter)

368
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,472
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

369
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:33,209
SAM: I mean, I don't trust it near us.

370
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:37,741
ASHLEY: That's my favorite thing you've ever
said.

371
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:43,564
SAM: Percy, I think you need to give it to me to
hold.

372
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,914
TALIESIN: I think that's a terrible idea.

373
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:47,866
SAM: No, I can take care of it better than you.

374
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,726
TALIESIN: What makes you think that?

375
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:52,443
SAM: Just give it to me. Trust me.

376
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,755
TALIESIN: You're bleeding out your eye right now!

377
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:58,978
SAM: I want revenge on this eye. Give it to me so
I can get revenge!

378
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:02,397
ASHLEY: Hold on. I cast Cure Wounds for his eye.

379
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:11,026
MATT: Yeah. The eye wasn't removed from the
socket, but the damage that was around it seems to

380
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:16,660
have healed up from the mild Cure Wounds. There's
still the drying blood that has pooled down the

381
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,397
cheek, but it appears that most of the initial
damage has been sealed.

382
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,822
ASHLEY: Do you want me to hold it?

383
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,236
TALIESIN: I kind of want you to hold it.

384
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,842
SAM: I think I should hold it.

385
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,502
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm going to hold onto it in
case it tries to attach itself to you again and

386
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,817
you pull out your eyeball again.

387
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:40,736
TALIESIN: Yes, and that thing should be difficult
to get out of. It it is a big case.

388
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:44,138
SAM: What if it can still hear us? Sense where we
are?

389
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:46,389
TRAVIS: It's an eyeball; it doesn't have ears.

390
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,647
SAM: That is true. That is a very good point.

391
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:55,798
TALIESIN: Well, if we're really amused by it, we
just set off the light crystal that's in there and

392
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,833
let it blind itself in there for a while. That
would be funny. We have bigger problems. Diamonds.

393
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,736
And Delilah.

394
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,978
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, she still goes in the bag,
right?

395
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:10,641
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. We're going to want to have a
word with her later.

396
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:13,286
MARISHA: Even beyond the diamonds.

397
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:29,139
TALIESIN: Vex. <i>Vex.</i> He needs you here, now. I
need you here. We're not done. This is not over

398
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:38,377
yet. We are in trouble. We need to find a city.
The two of you, I need both of you here.

399
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,242
LAURA: Of course, darling.

400
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,300
MARISHA: This was supposed to be a weekend trip.

401
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,349
TALIESIN: Nothing is ever what it's supposed to
be.

402
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,933
MARISHA: Just a weekend trip.

403
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:55,389
TALIESIN: I know. Let's get this done.

404
00:32:55,389 --> 00:33:05,566
MARISHA: Even after we find 25,000 gold pieces
worth of diamonds, I've never brought anyone back

405
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:17,896
before, and this is versus the Raven Queen. How do
we know if his soul is even available for return?

406
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:26,051
TALIESIN: How do we know that she is against us?
This was Vecna. She may still be with us.

407
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:29,919
LAURA: I can't believe I left his soul over there,
alone.

408
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,971
ASHLEY: We didn't.

409
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:36,656
LAURA: I did. I came back.

410
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,562
TALIESIN: We're not done.

411
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:49,479
MARISHA: Maybe we should talk to the Raven Queen.

412
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:53,967
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

413
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:57,923
LAURA: There's a temple in Vasselheim, and there's
a temple in Whitestone.

414
00:33:57,923 --> 00:34:00,411
MARISHA: Same way that he did.

415
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:06,256
TALIESIN: We need to find diamonds. Can we find
them while we're here?

416
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,870
Can we find them where we are?

417
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:13,742
LAURA: I don't know how you find diamonds in the
Feywild.

418
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:16,498
TRAVIS: Percy, don't you know the Feywild?

419
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:19,497
TALIESIN: Where are we?

420
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:25,754
TRAVIS: Do we see any structures off in the
distance, or is it all just overgrowth?

421
00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:31,933
MATT: You are in the center, or at least
completely surrounded by enclosed, dense,

422
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:38,717
bluish-purple forest. You cannot see above the
canopy. What little bit of light is visible seems

423
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:45,692
to be from a bioluminescence beneath the fog. As
you pushed below, you could see what appeared to

424
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:55,323
be bits of fungus that grew out of the forest
floor. The slowly dying off and decomposing leaves

425
00:34:55,323 --> 00:35:02,427
and fallen branches. It's almost like this
underlit glow, but you don't see any structures,

426
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:04,926
no signs of civilization. You have no idea where
you are.

427
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:06,868
You've not been to this part of the Feywild.

428
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:09,318
MARISHA: Maybe our werewolf friends are still
around.

429
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:16,327
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say I have a terrible
idea. I think they wanted to leave, so what if

430
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:23,574
they know of some hidden treasure trove around
here? That could, you know, tit for tit.

431
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:31,731
LAURA: I might be able to buy diamonds, as well.
If we go to a city.

432
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:36,689
SAM: If we rest, I may be able to make them.

433
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:39,912
LAURA: 25,000 gold worth of diamonds.

434
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:41,354
SAM: How big is that?

435
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:45,717
LAURA: It could be a lot of smaller diamonds.

436
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,129
SAM: But how big? How many?

437
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:51,037
LAURA: I'll pull out one diamond that I have
that's worth 1,500 gold.

438
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:54,616
TALIESIN: I feel within a tinker theory is how
figuring out how much diamonds--

439
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:56,466
LAURA: We would need 20 more of these.

440
00:35:56,466 --> 00:36:07,432
MATT: It can range based on the purity of the
diamond, how well it's been cut. You can make an

441
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,729
intelligence check, if you'd like.

442
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:11,036
TALIESIN: That'll do. I feel like this would be in
the wheelhouse.

443
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,238
LAURA: I have to blow my nose again.

444
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,216
TALIESIN: God, I am rolling just the worst. 13.

445
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:25,718
MATT: 13. I mean, that's a lot of diamonds. That
can range, depending on the purity and where in

446
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:31,785
the world they're found. There's a standard amount
when it comes to magic practices that aren't

447
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:36,891
tailored to the cultural variations of cost. You
couldn't ask somebody, "Sell me these diamonds,

448
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:45,235
"but for six times the cost," you know. It wouldn't
help the spell occur. That's the general

449
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:49,791
equivalent to the amount of diamonds that are
consumed required for his spell. You've never seen

450
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,303
that many diamonds in one place.

451
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:54,937
MARISHA: We don't have a body, so we're basically
making a diamond Vax.

452
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:56,564
TALIESIN: I know where there are diamonds.

453
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:57,942
LAURA: Where?

454
00:36:57,942 --> 00:37:01,843
SAM: I can make them. We just need an animal.

455
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:04,474
ASHLEY: How much can you make?

456
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,291
SAM: As much as the animal.

457
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,543
TRAVIS: Ooh, the bigger the animal, the bigger the
diamonds?

458
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,634
MARISHA: I can make animals.

459
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:18,106
SAM: I mean, I know you're grieving, but we could
give Trinket up for this.

460
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,745
MARISHA: I can make animals.

461
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:20,860
LAURA: Scanlan.

462
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,680
SAM: It was worth a try.

463
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,444
LAURA: You're such a shithead.

464
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:36,598
TALIESIN: There is a second thought, if this does
not go well. Which was-- there was one place where

465
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:40,669
we saw that many diamonds in one place before:
Thordak.

466
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:45,668
TRAVIS: Surely they've cleaned all that up by
now, right?

467
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:56,507
TALIESIN: Yes, but not everything left the city.
There's enough there. It didn't get randomly

468
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:01,013
distributed. I'm sure that they have it, and I'm
sure that we can make a deal.

469
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,443
TRAVIS: Take a loan?

470
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:06,086
TALIESIN: I have something worth money.

471
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,783
TRAVIS: Was it a bad idea?

472
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:11,081
SAM: Taking out a loan?

473
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,165
TRAVIS: Yeah!

474
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,734
SAM: To buy diamonds?

475
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:16,998
LAURA: We have gold. We have plenty of gold.

476
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,866
MARISHA: What did Kraghammer mine? What was their
deal?

477
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:32,225
MATT: All sorts of things. Many precious metals,
gems, stone that was used for crafting, hewing

478
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:37,708
into various forms of masonry. Anything that could
be reaped from beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains,

479
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,609
that's what Kraghammer specialized in.

480
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,734
MARISHA: What if we go to a mine? We could go
straight to a source, buy direct?

481
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:47,454
LAURA: We could go to Kraghammer and buy, or we
could try doing what Scanlan said.

482
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:50,742
SAM: We could try mine first, and if it doesn't
work-- but I need to rest.

483
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,682
I can't do anything today.

484
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:57,863
LAURA: Should we get back to our world?

485
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:00,239
TALIESIN: We go to Kraghammer, rest there.

486
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:07,421
MARISHA: We can't. We have to sleep before, unless
there's a portal nearby that we can get through.

487
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,076
LAURA: Did you send us to the pond? I thought you
took us to the pond.

488
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:19,273
MARISHA: It has to be nearby. Plane Shift is
general. I pick an area, and it gambles where it's

489
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,678
going to drop us.

490
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:22,667
MATT: And did you specify the location?

491
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:33,978
MARISHA: I did! I said the Shademirk Bog and the
pond, the glade. I found the page in my notes and

492
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:37,488
rambled all the names off very quickly in a
panic.

493
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:42,378
MATT: What's interesting, when last you were in the
Shademirk, you recall this being a very

494
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:46,040
oil-thickened forest.

495
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,755
LAURA: Oh, you took us to where Saundor was. You
didn't take us to the pond with the chick?

496
00:39:52,755 --> 00:40:00,074
MATT: Correct, this is the Shademirk. This is
where you battled with Saundor. However, the

497
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:04,187
forest you're in now, if this is indeed the same
location, it seems to have vastly recovered from

498
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:10,357
the corruption that Saundor's presence gave, which
is why it's both unfamiliar to you and not as

499
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,613
oppressive as the last time you visited.

500
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:20,058
MARISHA: Didn't we-- nope. I Plane Shifted us
out.

501
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:24,858
LAURA: We have to spend the night here. Vecna's in
our world.

502
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,961
TALIESIN: Vecna's in a box.

503
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:33,355
LAURA: How much power does he get from that eye?

504
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:36,953
TALIESIN: More than all of us combined, I'd
imagine.

505
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:41,285
TRAVIS: If it burrows in the ground, it can't
break out of the box, right?

506
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,022
TALIESIN: I don't know.

507
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:45,305
LAURA: Open the box and see what it's doing.

508
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:48,112
TALIESIN: We can look in the box without.

509
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:57,755
SAM: Give it to me. I'll take care of it. I'll
send it away to a place where only I can get it.

510
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:04,523
ASHLEY: Can I take a peek?

511
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:12,530
MATT: Yeah, you open it up. You hold it back and
hold the door open.

512
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,457
TALIESIN: There's a glass thing so we can look
through the glass.

513
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:17,876
MATT: Immediately, glancing in, you see it staring
right back at you.

514
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,604
MARISHA: (horrified wail)

515
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:23,914
LAURA: Don't send it to another plane; that's
very fucking weird.

516
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:27,469
SAM: But it's a personal plane. It's my plane.

517
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:30,297
LAURA: Are you sure nobody else can ever get into
it?

518
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,479
SAM: I am not.

519
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:32,731
LAURA: Then no.

520
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:36,527
SAM: I don't know how this works. My daughter
taught me this spell; I've never used it before.

521
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,083
LAURA: Then, fuck it, we're not doing it.

522
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:43,927
SAM: It goes into a little pocket dimension! Is
what she told me.

523
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,986
I don't even know what that means!

524
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:48,003
LAURA: That's really weird.

525
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,841
TALIESIN: What if it's the Vecna dimension?

526
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:54,494
SAM: Here, let's try something. Just give me
something, I'll send it there now. I don't know

527
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:56,149
what that'll do.

528
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:58,111
ASHLEY: How will we know it's there?

529
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,073
SAM: Give me Trinket.

530
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:00,725
LAURA: No! Stop it!

531
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:04,641
SAM: I can't do Trinket. It has to be less than
five pounds.

532
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,461
TRAVIS: Less than five pounds?

533
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:07,410
SAM: Yes.

534
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,645
ASHLEY: It has to be something small?

535
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:11,738
SAM: Yeah.

536
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,172
MARISHA: No! No, don't consider it Pike, no!

537
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,667
SAM: Give me anything.

538
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,485
TRAVIS: Do you want a pair of manacles?

539
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:19,675
SAM: Sure!

540
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:21,229
TRAVIS: Here's a pair of manacles.

541
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:23,867
SAM: All right. I will use Wrist Pocket!

542
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:27,868
MATT: You watch as he holds the manacles and does
a flourish with his hand

543
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:29,668
and they vanish from sight.

544
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:31,244
ASHLEY: How do you know if they're there?

545
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:34,742
SAM: I don't know where they are! I literally have
no idea, but watch this!

546
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:37,883
MATT: They seem to apparate immediately into his
grasp.

547
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,848
SAM: I don't know how I even do that!

548
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,468
LAURA: Cool. We're not using a random-ass magic
trick on an eyeball.

549
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:45,679
ASHLEY: Did you just point at me and tell me to
come to you so you can

550
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,111
make me disappear and come back?

551
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,837
SAM: No! The eye! I can get rid of the eye!

552
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:54,041
ASHLEY: No, it makes me nervous, Scanlan. I want
to keep our... eyes on it.

553
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,809
(laughter)

554
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,872
ASHLEY: Fuck off!

555
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:03,019
SAM: Maybe we should vote on this. Should we give
it to me? Who says aye?

556
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:06,364
TALIESIN: You can buy my vote.

557
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:11,452
SAM: I don't have that much.

558
00:43:11,452 --> 00:43:13,499
TALIESIN: Yes, you do. You can buy my vote.

559
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:14,776
SAM: I don't have enough.

560
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:16,428
LAURA: Are there any animals around?

561
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,945
MATT: Make a nature check.

562
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:21,924
LAURA: Natural 20.

563
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:29,468
MATT: You're familiar with forests, definitely,
and you can see telltale signs of scurrying,

564
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:37,116
telltale signs of track marks in the ground, feces
left behind by living creatures. You do see signs

565
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:39,830
of things that live throughout these forests
everywhere.

566
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:48,101
LAURA: Anything that looks like it would be the
size of an adult deer or something?

567
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:52,113
TRAVIS: Doe, a deer? A female deer?

568
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:58,735
LAURA: I'm thinking a male deer. Yes, a stag. A
white stag. Any stag, really,

569
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,406
just an animal that's big.

570
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:04,431
MATT: You see a number of tracks that would
resemble creatures of that size or larger. Some

571
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:11,443
seem bear-like, some seem larger than that, though
similar claws and heavy footprints. Some that are

572
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:19,316
smaller and skittery. You see there was a small cluster of
what might be deer-like creatures, but you're not

573
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:23,883
quite sure what the tracks are. There's plenty of
life that wanders through here. Apparently, since

574
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:28,623
you've arrived, none that seem bold enough to
approach you too closely in this clustered

575
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:34,791
clearing you're in. Can't even call it a clearing,
because you maybe have a total of ten feet you're

576
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:36,794
all crammed into at this time.

577
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:39,953
TRAVIS: If we howl, right?

578
00:44:39,953 --> 00:44:41,860
ASHLEY: Are we down?

579
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,884
LAURA: Yeah, we haven't healed since--

580
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:48,543
TALIESIN: We are wrecked.

581
00:44:48,543 --> 00:44:50,527
ASHLEY: How's everybody doing?

582
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:51,730
LAURA: I'm low.

583
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,549
SAM: Aren't you low, Pike? Like 11 or something.

584
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:57,850
LAURA: I mean, we're about to rest. You're
probably super low.

585
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:07,850
ASHLEY: I think am, let's see if I wrote it down
here. Oh, yeah! I forgot! I'm almost dead.

586
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,351
LAURA: Trinket's unconscious still in my
necklace.

587
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:13,404
ASHLEY: Okay.

588
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:19,069
LAURA: He's unconscious. I pop him out, if you're
going to heal us.

589
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:21,532
MATT: (magic noise)

590
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,403
TRAVIS: Aw, buddy.

591
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:25,552
LAURA: I start crying again.

592
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:29,773
SAM: I turn him into diamonds.

593
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:33,959
LAURA: You dick! You're such an asshole.

594
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:37,156
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

595
00:45:37,156 --> 00:45:39,471
LAURA: Pike's going to heal us.

596
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:41,194
TALIESIN: Heal and sleep.

597
00:45:41,194 --> 00:45:43,790
LAURA: I'm going to kill something.

598
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,892
TALIESIN: Let Keyleth make something big.

599
00:45:46,892 --> 00:45:49,158
MATT: What are you casting, Pike?

600
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:51,089
ASHLEY: Mass Cure Wounds.

601
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,632
MATT: Mass Cure Wounds? All right, go for it.

602
00:45:52,632 --> 00:46:02,277
LAURA: Will it work on a magical animal, or does
it have to be a real animal?

603
00:46:02,277 --> 00:46:08,447
SAM: No, it can work on anything, I think. I've
never turned anything into diamonds.

604
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:11,895
TRAVIS: If I had that, I'd be doing that all the
time.

605
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:17,779
SAM: You're right. In retrospect, I should have
been doing this literally every day. I just

606
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:19,382
learned the spell a week ago.

607
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:21,936
TRAVIS: Why are you dealing drugs? Just be like
boop!

608
00:46:21,936 --> 00:46:26,149
SAM: Yeah, but look at this! It's gone! It's back!
Cool, right?

609
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:36,833
TRAVIS: And think how useful that will come in the
bedroom. Manacles! Nobody? Cool.

610
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,376
LAURA: I was like, pocket dimension?

611
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:41,519
ASHLEY: You all heal 31 points. It's something.

612
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,892
MARISHA: 31? All of us?

613
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:47,409
MATT: Everyone healed 31. Trinket gets up, (bear
grumbling).

614
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:50,693
LAURA: Yeah. Hey, Trink.

615
00:46:50,693 --> 00:46:58,733
SAM: You guys need more healing? I could try to
give us more.

616
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:05,190
LAURA: We're going to rest. Are we safe to leave
fucking-- there's nothing we can do, at this

617
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,257
point-- to leave Vecna in the world. We can't do
anything!

618
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:17,500
TALIESIN: We have one problem at a time. We have
Delilah, and we will deal with--

619
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,759
MARISHA: What do you want to do with Delilah?

620
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:21,952
MATT: She's been stuffed into the Bag of Holding.

621
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:27,167
TALIESIN: We're going to talk to her. We're going
to see what we can learn. We're going to be very

622
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:34,052
thoughtful about what we talk to her about, and
we're going to find a way of making sure that this

623
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:39,239
is the last time we put her in the ground. By hook
or by crook.

624
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:44,654
LAURA: Don't cry on camera and then have to blow
your nose a bunch!

625
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:49,366
SAM: She says to a nearby tree.

626
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:58,554
ASHLEY: Should we try killing an animal and seeing
how many diamonds you get out of it?

627
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:01,151
SAM: I can't try anything today.

628
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:02,958
LAURA: Okay, we have to wait.

629
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:05,639
TALIESIN: Tomorrow, we go to Kraghammer, we make
an animal.

630
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,681
LAURA: We don't have the mansion tonight.

631
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:09,109
SAM: No.

632
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:12,962
ASHLEY: Do you want to Speak with Dead before bed,
or do you want to sleep on it?

633
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:17,901
TRAVIS: We don't need the mansion; I got all my
hit points. I'm good.

634
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:23,381
TALIESIN: I don't think I'm in the right mind to
even think of anything to say to her that isn't

635
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:26,820
just rage, at the moment.

636
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,783
LAURA: We need to get up in a tree. I don't know
what's in this area. I saw some tracks that didn't

637
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:33,854
look friendly.

638
00:48:33,854 --> 00:48:36,629
TALIESIN: Let's get up there.

639
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:41,006
TRAVIS: Aren't these trees dangerous in their own
right?

640
00:48:41,006 --> 00:48:44,066
TALIESIN: They seem like they've quieted down.

641
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:46,777
LAURA: We healed this forest; it should thank us.

642
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:53,417
TRAVIS: Okay. Did the bow talk to the trees or
anything? Fenthras.

643
00:48:53,417 --> 00:49:00,061
MATT: Interesting. With the natural 20 nature
check you made earlier: there is, I don't want to

644
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:08,248
say, not a kinship, but a sense of understanding
between you and the surrounding forest. It's hard

645
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:12,507
to explain, and you haven't really had this sense
before; this is more a Keyleth territory of having

646
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:18,329
this connection with nature. But it's because you
wield Fenthras and were responsible in a large way

647
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:24,588
for cleansing this landscape, that as you begin to
approach and look for trees for a place to sleep,

648
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:31,063
you watch as one tree, the branches seem to bend
down to form a small ladder. You watch as the

649
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:38,352
boughs above separate and create an
easy-to-lay-down cluster of branches and leaves.

650
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:39,887
TALIESIN: Small miracles.

651
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:41,363
MARISHA: They like us now.

652
00:49:41,363 --> 00:49:42,784
LAURA: Thank you.

653
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:45,093
TRAVIS: You guys crash; I'll take first watch.

654
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:55,017
LAURA: I'm going to pull the armor up so we can
keep it. Did you want--

655
00:49:55,017 --> 00:50:00,302
MARISHA: Yeah. We cuddle between the armor.

656
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:03,235
TALIESIN: That's weird. I'm not getting into it.

657
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:04,934
MARISHA: That's the saddest thing.

658
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:10,860
MATT: That's pretty sad. All right. The rest of
you find yourselves to a night's rest, seemingly

659
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:19,325
protected for the time being by the surrounding
Shademirk Forest, no longer the Shademirk Bog. And

660
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:24,568
unconsciousness takes you, Grog taking first
watch. Now, I'm going to ask you guys, if you

661
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,842
wouldn't mind, to step into the kitchen.

662
00:50:26,842 --> 00:50:28,054
TRAVIS: What, me?

663
00:50:28,054 --> 00:50:29,401
SAM: Everybody but Grog?

664
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,831
MATT: Everybody but Liam.

665
00:50:31,831 --> 00:50:36,543
LAURA: Oh fuck me running. We're jacking off.

666
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:40,332
MARISHA: Jacking off. Oh man.

667
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,591
ASHLEY: No, I feel like you're going to make
plans.

668
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,671
LAURA: What are you going to do while we're not in
here?

669
00:50:44,671 --> 00:50:45,759
TRAVIS: Go.

670
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,075
SAM: A whole new show.

671
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:50,762
LIAM: Spin-off.

672
00:50:50,762 --> 00:51:01,546
MATT: All right, we're getting Liam back in here.
Shoo. No, we'll probably have you back in.

673
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:08,750
Getting tangled?

674
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:15,792
MARISHA: Don't die forever.

675
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:33,844
MATT: We'll wait for them to leave the room.

676
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:38,353
Vax'ildan. As your eyes dart back and forth,

677
00:51:38,353 --> 00:51:44,620
glancing upward at the sky above, snow hitting and
stinging your paralyzed eyes, you see the terrible

678
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:59,253
lich above you, a flash of green, then darkness.
Floating without weight, without temperature. You

679
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:04,761
glance around in the surrounding shadow and cannot
see anything; your hands before you, nothing. It

680
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:13,107
is just void, darkness. You will yourself to see
something, anything, and in an instant, you begin

681
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:21,050
to glow. Your form becomes visible around you. You
can now see your body, nude and held aloft in this

682
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:25,753
dark space, emanating this soft, vibrant
orangish-white light.

683
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:37,432
As the light begins to emanate and cast away the
darkness, you also see what appears to be a

684
00:52:37,432 --> 00:52:45,130
tangling of some sort of web: strands of silk that
also begin to glow with a similar light as to your

685
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:53,796
form that holds you tightly in your position. You
struggle, but you're held firm. You think you yell

686
00:52:53,796 --> 00:53:02,071
out, but as you glance upward to shout for help,
you see the shadows now curl back to reveal the

687
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:12,704
familiar sight of a massive white porcelain
woman's face. Eyeless, yet staring straight at, if

688
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:23,542
not through you. Her presence, imposing as it may
be, soothes you as her giant hand, larger than a

689
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:30,708
house, a palace, it seems, almost, emerges from
below and gives you a ground to step on, your feet

690
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,898
finding purchase in the center of her dark palm.

691
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:41,130
As your feet touch her palm, the silk web seems to
loosen. You cast off the threads and fall to your

692
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:57,461
hands and knees. You take a moment, and you hear
that soft voice once more. "My champion, you

693
00:53:57,461 --> 00:54:08,340
"return to me and tear a swath through the
tapestry. Please, be calm. My sight can pierce

694
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:17,748
"many veils, but you've been hidden from my sight
in recent days, and I am worried what foulness has

695
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:28,497
"turned its intent upon us. Now, here you come to
me, your very thread frayed and soul

696
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:37,484
"transitioning. An unexpected destiny for my
beautiful fate-touched." One of her fingers curls

697
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:45,024
through your hair at the back of your head. "Tell
me what you have seen."

698
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:48,137
LIAM: Your enemy.

699
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:51,434
MATT: "I have many enemies."

700
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:55,798
LIAM: Vecna.

701
00:54:55,798 --> 00:55:04,741
MATT: "What does this Vecna intend?"

702
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:27,121
LIAM: He's come... he's come back to our world. My
home. My family is in danger.

703
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:30,932
The world is in danger.

704
00:55:30,932 --> 00:55:44,631
MATT: "How so? How can one man be this dangerous?
What does he intend? What have you learned?"

705
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:57,258
LIAM: I don't know.

706
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:18,544
MATT: "I wonder why he guards my sight. Well." She
goes into quiet contemplation for a moment. You

707
00:56:18,544 --> 00:56:25,439
see the strands of hair that emanate from the
sides of the mask slowly shifting like waves on an

708
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:40,359
ocean. "This Vecna comes to your world to be a
king?"

709
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:51,985
LIAM: That or grind us all into dust.

710
00:56:51,985 --> 00:57:04,155
MATT: "This is historical. Mortals continuously
intend to find others to grind into dust. If this

711
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:16,243
"being has the power to block my sight, he has
power beyond a mortal realm. Did you see anything?

712
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:19,497
"Anything else?"

713
00:57:19,497 --> 00:57:36,948
LIAM: We traveled to the Shadowfell. There was a
tower, and he had servants. He had powerful

714
00:57:36,948 --> 00:57:52,223
servants. A woman that we've fought before, and
another, a man, a creature. I don't know. With a

715
00:57:52,223 --> 00:58:08,432
blade, a dark blade. And he was too powerful for
us. He crushed us.

716
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:18,465
MATT: "And in your short spark with him, you
learned nothing more of his plan?

717
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:22,076
"No hint of what he's plotting?"

718
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:41,435
LIAM: He threw me to the ground the first second
he laid his eye on me. He murdered my sister. I

719
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:46,300
thought we had come to an arrangement.

720
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,278
MATT: "We have."

721
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:52,814
LIAM: Where is my sister?

722
00:58:52,814 --> 00:59:09,590
MATT: "She lives, still. She is beyond my
influence. However, your body is ash, and your

723
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:20,653
"soul is steeped in the divine energies that uphold
the paths between life and death. You've earned

724
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:27,337
"your eternal rest." The mask begins to recede
into the darkness.

725
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:46,914
LIAM: No. No! Come back. No! I will not leave them
behind. I want to help them, still.

726
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:55,471
MATT: The faint gray of the mask that begins to
fade into shadow stops and comes back even

727
00:59:55,471 --> 01:00:06,930
brighter, vibrant, almost. You sense the mystery
of the Raven Queen shift from this entity that

728
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:14,467
dodges and weaves to instead a pillar of power of
life and death that is both awe-striking and

729
01:00:14,467 --> 01:00:21,945
awe-fearing. And for a moment, you realize how
small you are in her presence.

730
01:00:21,945 --> 01:00:31,259
"You truly see, to seek this, to bring it to its end?"

731
01:00:31,259 --> 01:00:36,334
LIAM: Whatever it takes.

732
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:53,171
MATT: "Your resolve is admirable. Your love of
your chosen family is vibrant. What I offer you is

733
01:00:53,171 --> 01:01:01,119
"the power to see this conflict through to its end.
You will be briefly beyond the very grasp of

734
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:12,152
"death, and I will hold back any attempt for you to
transition. You will be a bulwark of my power in

735
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:22,147
"cold flesh, walking between heartbeats,
unstoppable. You will have the power to walk once

736
01:01:22,147 --> 01:01:31,538
"more with Vox Machina, with your sister, with your
Keyleth. And should you use this power wisely,

737
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:46,793
"perhaps save Exandria, save them, save her. But
when it's done and this foul, undying king lies

738
01:01:46,793 --> 01:01:56,048
"dead or sealed, you will return to me, my
champion, evermore."

739
01:01:56,048 --> 01:02:05,324
The imposing image now shifts and changes. In an
instant, the giant being is now the simple woman,

740
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:16,230
the mask you once saw removed now missing. And
there, the somewhat sad, beautiful pale face of

741
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:22,024
the Raven Queen as she steps forward. The silence
is broken by the sounds of her footsteps across

742
01:02:22,024 --> 01:02:33,156
nothing. (footsteps) Her hand comes up. Warm. You
weren't expecting, as it traces across your brow

743
01:02:33,156 --> 01:02:41,871
and curves across to your chin and pulls it up.
"Do you accept my gift?"

744
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:48,945
LIAM: You have such loneliness in your eyes.

745
01:02:48,945 --> 01:03:07,330
MATT: "Perhaps you will keep me company when you
come back to me. Do you accept?"

746
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,032
LIAM: I do.

747
01:03:10,032 --> 01:03:21,961
MATT: "Then so be it. You, whose nature bucks
destiny, my beautiful thing. Go. Share what you

748
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:37,307
"have shared with me with others like me. Take what
you can learn of this Vecna's plans, for if he can

749
01:03:37,307 --> 01:03:49,972
"block his intent from one, who knows what he plots
against the other powers beyond the gate? Learn

750
01:03:49,972 --> 01:04:00,163
"from them. Ask them. You have my blessing. They
have theirs to give, as well, and they may be all

751
01:04:00,163 --> 01:04:11,605
"that stands between the ruin of this world and
you. Let their blessings turn the tides,

752
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:23,839
"Vax'ildan. But use your time wisely, for
corruption like this waits for no one. Now." She

753
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:28,000
pulls your head down and kisses you on the
forehead and brings your head close to hers, and

754
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,442
you hear a voice whisper right into your ear, ever
so faintly. "Wake up!"

755
01:04:34,442 --> 01:04:41,001
We need to go ahead and retrieve the rest of the
cast now, if you wouldn't mind stepping aside.

756
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,159
LIAM: Sure.

757
01:04:42,159 --> 01:05:14,265
MATT: Thank you. (sighs, laughs) That's
interesting. I'm here in silence. How creepy is

758
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:21,027
this? I never get to talk with you guys at the
table by myself. I don't even know what to do. Oh,

759
01:05:21,027 --> 01:05:29,335
they enter now. (laughs) Welcome back! Come, have
a seat! Plug in!

760
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:32,136
TRAVIS: Why did you go so far away?

761
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,611
MATT: Jack in.

762
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:40,309
SAM: By the way, audience, Travis pointed out as
we left, they might not know what we were talking

763
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:46,182
about when we all said, "oh, we're going to jack
off now." It means unplug our microphone cords.

764
01:05:46,182 --> 01:05:48,145
MATT: Oh yeah, that's actually a pretty good--

765
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,306
SAM: We're not--

766
01:05:49,306 --> 01:05:50,530
TRAVIS: Performing illicit acts.

767
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,733
TALIESIN: I am, but everyone else isn't.

768
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:54,240
MATT: To each their own, I suppose.

769
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,795
TALIESIN: That's the hard part.

770
01:05:57,795 --> 01:06:02,082
SAM: Why was Liam crying in the hallway?

771
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:05,187
MATT: (laughs)

772
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:08,320
TALIESIN: Sam's scamming you.

773
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,508
LAURA: Jacking in.

774
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:13,144
SAM: Jacking in.

775
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:17,780
ASHLEY: What happened?

776
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,790
MATT: All right.

777
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:25,980
SAM: I can verify that none of us listened or read
anything about what just happened. We were jacking

778
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,278
off the whole time.

779
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:29,315
(laughter)

780
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,896
TALIESIN: We had to hide at the other end of the
building, man. That was nuts.

781
01:06:31,896 --> 01:06:40,494
MATT: So as you make your watch. Who's making
second watch?

782
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:42,281
TRAVIS: I'll take both.

783
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,666
TALIESIN and LAURA: No.

784
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,042
SAM: You need to rest.

785
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,374
TRAVIS: I don't, boo.

786
01:06:46,374 --> 01:06:47,753
LAURA: Yeah, you do. You need to sleep.

787
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,004
MARISHA: You don't want to be exhausted.

788
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,650
SAM: You've got to get your spells back, man.

789
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,271
TRAVIS: Yeah.

790
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:55,318
MARISHA: How long does he have to rest so he's not
exhausted?

791
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:56,392
MATT: Long rest.

792
01:06:56,392 --> 01:07:00,134
TALIESIN: These are all long rests. We're all
getting long rests. I'll take second watch.

793
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:02,050
TRAVIS: I'm already exhausted. I frenzied last.

794
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:06,435
MATT: Yeah, so if you don't rest, you don't get
rid of that point of exhaustion.

795
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:09,528
TRAVIS: We've all learned what happens when I get
two points of exhaustion. Good things.

796
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:11,303
TALIESIN: Vecna comes back, and we all die.

797
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:13,079
LAURA: Vecna is back.

798
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:18,494
MATT: All right, so Percival, second watch?
Perception check.

799
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:26,431
TALIESIN: That'll do. That's a 21.

800
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:33,925
MATT: Okay. Your watch continues without issue.
Final watch is?

801
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,122
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

802
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:41,406
MATT: Pike. Final watch. Perception check.

803
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:46,383
ASHLEY: 19.

804
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:52,676
MATT: 19, okay. While there is no real change from
day to night in the Feywild, it's in that

805
01:07:52,676 --> 01:08:00,033
perpetual nearly dusk, sunset, purple-orange
skyline, which you can see elements of creeping

806
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:07,418
through since you're higher up in the brush of the
forest. You do hear the shifting of sounds. The

807
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:15,357
evening owl hooting has changed to more gentle
bird chirps and sounds that would usually befit

808
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:22,800
birds that lead to morning to you. Whether that be
the forest itself, its natural cycle, or it

809
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:31,385
altering to fit your cycle of sleep. At the end of
your watch-- you've had your full rest, but are

810
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:42,204
still a little groggy, you hear what sounds like
the crushing of leaves on the ground below you.

811
01:08:42,204 --> 01:08:51,375
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to hop up and hide in the
tree. I guess I'm looking awake in the tree.

812
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:57,111
MATT: Okay. You're up in the tree, still. You
glance down.

813
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:02,512
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep watching.

814
01:09:02,512 --> 01:09:14,846
MATT: You see a humanoid figure emerge from one of
the nearby trees. Pale, nude.

815
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:18,725
SAM: (whispering) Get on that.

816
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:21,679
(laughter)

817
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:33,684
MATT: Long, dark black hair. Groggily stepping
into the glade where you just were.

818
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:39,141
MARISHA: Is this your nymph?

819
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,847
MATT: It's a familiar figure.

820
01:09:41,847 --> 01:09:45,174
TRAVIS: Long, dark black hair? Pale?

821
01:09:45,174 --> 01:09:46,573
ASHLEY: I run down from the tree.

822
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:48,458
SAM: It's Powder from the movie Powder.

823
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:52,260
LAURA: Wait! Vax? I don't know. I'm asleep.

824
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,512
MARISHA: We're asleep?

825
01:09:55,512 --> 01:09:57,440
MATT: You crawl down.

826
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,861
LAURA: What the fuck?

827
01:10:01,861 --> 01:10:04,378
ASHLEY: I don't want him to see me.

828
01:10:04,378 --> 01:10:07,961
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

829
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:13,508
SAM: What has happened?

830
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:21,100
ASHLEY: Oh. 22.

831
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:34,515
MATT: 22. (laughs) Passive wisdom. As you
carefully stay in the tree, you shake your head a

832
01:10:34,515 --> 01:10:39,559
bit, wandering into this opening here, not quite
sure where you are as your senses are coming to,

833
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:50,906
and you hear this slight scraping of something
against bark. You immediately glance up and can

834
01:10:50,906 --> 01:10:56,783
see the small shine of a silver-and-brass set of
armor as a tiny gnome is currently held up into

835
01:10:56,783 --> 01:11:02,786
the boughs of a tree.

836
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:06,537
LIAM: Pickle?

837
01:11:06,537 --> 01:11:08,753
ASHLEY: Stringbean?

838
01:11:08,753 --> 01:11:10,671
LIAM: Hi.

839
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,709
ASHLEY: Hi.

840
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:15,182
LIAM: Where are we?

841
01:11:15,182 --> 01:11:24,968
ASHLEY: We're in the Feywild. Where did you just
come from?

842
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:44,741
LIAM: I'm not entirely sure. I died. Did you know
that?

843
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:51,244
ASHLEY: I did know that. We're trying to figure
out how to save you.

844
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:54,431
LIAM: What are you going to do?

845
01:11:54,431 --> 01:11:59,822
ASHLEY: I don't know.

846
01:11:59,822 --> 01:12:03,648
LIAM: Sorry, I'm a little confused.

847
01:12:03,648 --> 01:12:05,865
ASHLEY: That's okay.

848
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:12,154
MATT: The naturally sensitive ears, even in
a sleeping state, that are Vex's, being the

849
01:12:12,154 --> 01:12:16,775
wild hunter you are, you hear a suddenly loud
voice below that catches your attention, and your

850
01:12:16,775 --> 01:12:18,415
eyes flicker open.

851
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:24,131
LIAM: Oh, fuck.

852
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:27,513
LAURA: I get up and run down.

853
01:12:27,513 --> 01:12:32,384
MATT: Darting down the tree rapidly. You watch as
your sister falls into the foliage. There you see

854
01:12:32,384 --> 01:12:37,696
before you, your brother. Clothes-less.

855
01:12:37,696 --> 01:12:40,699
LIAM: I thought you died. I watched you die.

856
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:47,325
LAURA: It's a trick! It's a trick. It's a trick of
the Feywild.

857
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:52,623
LIAM: I'm sorry I'm naked. Come here. I'm all
right.

858
01:12:52,623 --> 01:13:00,794
MATT: He's physical. He's cold. But he's there.

859
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:03,316
LAURA: How are you here?

860
01:13:03,316 --> 01:13:13,267
LIAM: I don't know. I died.

861
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:16,570
LAURA: I know. I didn't see it. I died, too.

862
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,336
LIAM: But you're back.

863
01:13:19,336 --> 01:13:21,487
LAURA: So are you.

864
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,343
LIAM: I'm so glad you're back. Don't cry.

865
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:29,719
LAURA: I have your armor, and Keyleth-- are you
all right? Are you really here?

866
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,680
LIAM: Yeah, I'm really here.

867
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,403
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check to make sure
it's actually him?

868
01:13:35,403 --> 01:13:41,141
MATT: Sure.

869
01:13:41,141 --> 01:13:43,571
LAURA: 20.

870
01:13:43,571 --> 01:13:49,575
MATT: 20? Right as you've known your brother,
there doesn't seem

871
01:13:49,575 --> 01:13:51,827
to be anything that tells you otherwise.

872
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,427
ASHLEY: Vax?

873
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:58,493
Can I put my hand on his chest and see if
I feel a heartbeat?

874
01:13:58,493 --> 01:14:03,476
MATT: Now as you notice, now that you've lost
focus from the fact that he's there, you can see

875
01:14:03,578 --> 01:14:10,821
where previously, there was a small, darkened spot
on his chest that looked like a bruise of some

876
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:16,065
kind that never quite went away, it has expanded a
bit to be almost in the shape of wings across the

877
01:14:16,065 --> 01:14:20,931
front of the chest.

878
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:25,873
ASHLEY: Do I feel a heartbeat?

879
01:14:25,873 --> 01:14:30,975
MATT: You listen closely. Make a medicine check.

880
01:14:30,975 --> 01:14:33,293
LIAM: What's the matter, Pike?

881
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:35,611
ASHLEY: That's a natural 20.

882
01:14:35,611 --> 01:14:41,746
MATT: Oh shit. You get close, and to get close to
where his heart is,

883
01:14:41,746 --> 01:14:44,169
you have to pull him down a bit.

884
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:47,724
LAURA: There's a dick, and he's naked.

885
01:14:47,724 --> 01:14:49,839
LIAM: And she's really short.

886
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:52,795
MATT: With gnomish size right now, this is getting
all sorts of weird.

887
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:56,422
SAM: Just come down.

888
01:14:56,422 --> 01:14:59,536
LIAM: Listen, I'm a cleric. It's nothing I haven't
seen before.

889
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:01,709
ASHLEY: I see them all the time.

890
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:03,609
SAM: She's a doctor. It's fine.

891
01:15:03,609 --> 01:15:05,558
LIAM: You clear diseases.

892
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:18,703
MATT: You hear a very faint, slow heartbeat. It's
there. (slow heartbeat)

893
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:22,281
TRAVIS: Oh, it's that slow? That's like Lance
Armstrong sleeping slow.

894
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:25,660
SAM: It's three BPM.

895
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,139
ASHLEY: Okay.

896
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:33,530
LAURA: Does he sound weird?

897
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:42,043
ASHLEY: I can't figure it out. Sometimes when
people are very athletic, they have very slow

898
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:54,076
heart rates. You're very in shape. I'm going to
climb up the tree and wake up Keyleth.

899
01:15:54,161 --> 01:15:57,543
LAURA: Tell her to bring the armor down.

900
01:15:57,543 --> 01:16:01,854
TALIESIN: Is anybody else waking up at this
point?

901
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:06,204
MATT: Percival, you've got a pretty decent
perception. At this point, with the sound and the

902
01:16:06,204 --> 01:16:10,542
shifting up and down the tree, and you guys are
pretty alert by nature, you all start coming to.

903
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,772
TRAVIS: I'm not perceptive at all.

904
01:16:12,772 --> 01:16:15,104
MATT: Except for Grog. You're snoring.

905
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:21,813
SAM: I've got one perception. Oh, it's passive.

906
01:16:21,813 --> 01:16:23,004
MATT: You're both asleep.

907
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:25,293
ASHLEY: Come down from the tree real quick.

908
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:26,890
MARISHA: What's going on, Pike?

909
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,128
ASHLEY: Everything's okay.

910
01:16:28,128 --> 01:16:33,832
MARISHA: Pike, I need you to tell me before I come
around this corner and see.

911
01:16:33,832 --> 01:16:37,607
ASHLEY: I grab her hand. It's okay. Come with me.

912
01:16:37,607 --> 01:16:40,218
MARISHA: I am not coming with you until you tell
me, Pike.

913
01:16:40,218 --> 01:16:44,749
ASHLEY: Vax is at the bottom of the tree.

914
01:16:44,749 --> 01:16:47,317
TALIESIN: I grab my stuff, and I immediately run
down the tree.

915
01:16:47,317 --> 01:16:50,981
MARISHA: I clutch onto Vax's armor.

916
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:54,480
LIAM: I don't know.

917
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:01,432
LAURA: She sent you back.

918
01:17:01,432 --> 01:17:03,679
LIAM: Yeah.

919
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:10,324
LAURA: She's my new favorite.

920
01:17:10,324 --> 01:17:17,204
TALIESIN: Vex, I need you to step away from him.
Vax, if it is you, I hope you understand, and

921
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:20,957
please, just for a second, thank you.

922
01:17:20,957 --> 01:17:22,841
LIAM: Fred, it's fine.

923
01:17:22,841 --> 01:17:29,151
TALIESIN: We're fighting the perversion of death
itself. This is what I would do to torture us.

924
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:37,028
Let's figure this out before we hand him back
anything that's older than we are.

925
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:40,854
LIAM: I hand the armor over to my sister.

926
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:44,201
MATT: The armor's still being clutched by
Keyleth.

927
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:47,246
LIAM: Oh, I didn't get it yet? I thought she put
it in my hands. All right.

928
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,952
TALIESIN: I'm keeping some distance.

929
01:17:49,952 --> 01:17:59,911
LIAM: You created a temple for me. You know who I
serve.

930
01:17:59,911 --> 01:18:08,456
TALIESIN: Oh, I believe you're you. I just have to
make sure what brought you back. I don't even know

931
01:18:08,456 --> 01:18:19,025
if you would know yet. Pike, does he have a
heartbeat? Is he undead?

932
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:21,461
ASHLEY: He has a heartbeat.

933
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:23,844
TALIESIN: Have you tried Turn Undead?

934
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:26,554
LIAM: You would know if there's evil in my heart.

935
01:18:26,554 --> 01:18:29,174
TALIESIN: It's not your heart I'm worried about.

936
01:18:29,174 --> 01:18:31,433
LIAM: You would know if there's evil in my heart.

937
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:35,690
LAURA: He's fine.

938
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,677
LIAM: You would.

939
01:18:37,677 --> 01:18:42,369
TALIESIN: If he's not, you will not survive this.

940
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:46,055
MATT: You actually haven't seen Keyleth yet. She's
still up in the tree.

941
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,687
LIAM: I'm very confused.

942
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,032
MATT: It's okay.

943
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:51,373
LAURA: They were talking up in the tree.

944
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:57,935
TALIESIN: I'm sure it's going to be fine. Let's
just take a minute and reflect on every terrible

945
01:18:57,935 --> 01:19:05,948
thing that's happened over the last 24 hours and
be careful for once. I'm so sorry.

946
01:19:05,948 --> 01:19:12,374
LIAM: No. He's absolutely right. This is insane.

947
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:14,272
TALIESIN: This is madness.

948
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:18,891
ASHLEY: Vax, what do you like to do with my hair?

949
01:19:18,891 --> 01:19:23,948
LIAM: (weak laughter)

950
01:19:23,948 --> 01:19:29,049
TALIESIN: It's him in there. Let's just make sure
that it's him that is the rest of him.

951
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:32,061
LAURA: What do you mean, he's a lich or
something?

952
01:19:32,061 --> 01:19:41,510
TALIESIN: Could Vecna put Vax into something
designed to hurt us? I believe it's Vax. It's the

953
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,154
rest of it.

954
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:49,903
ASHLEY: Do you remember anything from when you
woke up?

955
01:19:49,903 --> 01:20:03,646
LIAM: I remember hitting the ground, and I
remember watching you die, and then it was her

956
01:20:03,646 --> 01:20:05,136
face again.

957
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:06,860
LAURA: The Raven Queen?

958
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,852
LIAM: Yeah.

959
01:20:08,852 --> 01:20:11,992
TALIESIN: What would happen to him if you tried to
Turn Undead?

960
01:20:11,992 --> 01:20:16,354
LIAM: Go ahead.

961
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:19,572
LAURA: What if he is, though?

962
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:22,234
TALIESIN: If anything awful happens, he should
survive it.

963
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:29,296
LIAM: Go ahead. Get it out of the way. I'm not
worried about it.

964
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:32,489
ASHLEY: I know, but what if it does something--

965
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:38,262
LIAM: If I'm undead, then I shouldn't be here with
you, all of you.

966
01:20:38,262 --> 01:20:42,648
TALIESIN: If you're dead, we'll just have to be
extra careful, and we'll have a little more

967
01:20:42,648 --> 01:20:44,619
understanding of what's happening.

968
01:20:44,619 --> 01:20:46,366
LIAM: Where is Keyleth?

969
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:53,746
TALIESIN: When has a random miracle ever just
happened? If we work for a miracle, that's one

970
01:20:53,746 --> 01:20:59,131
thing, but this sort of thing doesn't end up on
your doorstep. You know that.

971
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:01,481
ASHLEY: Vax?

972
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:10,690
LAURA: Will he survive it? I don't think he is
undead.

973
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,477
ASHLEY: I don't, either.

974
01:21:12,477 --> 01:21:21,792
LAURA: But I don't want him to be able to be
turned against us. He looks normal.

975
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:24,695
TALIESIN: Does he?

976
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:30,803
LIAM: You used to give me wet willies in Abyssal
class. It's me.

977
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:32,301
LAURA: I know it's you.

978
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:34,786
ASHLEY: You have something new on your chest.

979
01:21:34,786 --> 01:21:44,664
LIAM: What? Oh shit. Well, that's extra.

980
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:47,274
ASHLEY: Keyleth?

981
01:21:47,274 --> 01:21:51,436
MARISHA: Will you come here for a second? Okay.

982
01:21:51,436 --> 01:21:54,377
ASHLEY: I climb back up the tree.

983
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:57,879
MARISHA: I could hear everything that's going on
because it's down the tree.

984
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,107
ASHLEY: Are you okay?

985
01:22:00,107 --> 01:22:09,233
MARISHA: No, I'm super not okay. What's going on?
What the fuck is going on?!

986
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:11,941
LAURA: Keyleth, we can hear you.

987
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:17,459
MARISHA: Fuck all of you! For a fucking second,
just tell me.

988
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:27,076
ASHLEY: I was watching, and then I saw him walk
out of the tree of sorts, and I think it's him,

989
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:32,669
and he's obviously naked.

990
01:22:32,669 --> 01:22:37,101
MARISHA: I have his armor.

991
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:44,663
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe you would be able to tell, to
see what's going on. I think you should come down.

992
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:46,649
It will be okay.

993
01:22:46,649 --> 01:22:50,427
MARISHA: Okay. You go first. I'll follow you.

994
01:22:50,427 --> 01:22:51,672
ASHLEY: Okay.

995
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:56,231
MARISHA: I follow her down.

996
01:22:56,231 --> 01:23:03,869
MATT: Okay. You come down, and there, next to Vex
and Percival, at a distance of a few feet, you see

997
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:10,299
the pale body standing before you of Vax'ildan,
breathing.

998
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:14,882
LIAM: Hi.

999
01:23:14,882 --> 01:23:20,190
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

1000
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,911
MATT: You guys wake up, slowly, from all of this.

1001
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:28,082
TALIESIN: I cannot wait for you both to be angry
with me later.

1002
01:23:28,082 --> 01:23:33,118
ASHLEY: Okay.

1003
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:35,805
MARISHA: Does he feel cold?

1004
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:38,523
MATT: Colder than you remember, yeah.

1005
01:23:38,523 --> 01:23:40,544
LAURA: Oh god, he's undead.

1006
01:23:40,544 --> 01:23:49,531
MARISHA: Is it you? I thought I killed you.

1007
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:52,759
LIAM: You?

1008
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:57,654
MARISHA: I could have done more.

1009
01:23:57,654 --> 01:24:04,018
LIAM: No. Nobody could have done more for me. No.

1010
01:24:04,018 --> 01:24:10,269
MARISHA: You're cold.

1011
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:17,038
LIAM: Am I? I probably should put some clothes on,
then.

1012
01:24:17,038 --> 01:24:21,422
MARISHA: I put my ear up to his chest.

1013
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:26,100
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1014
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:37,067
MARISHA: Natural 18. 24.

1015
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:40,067
MATT: You hear the faint, slow heartbeat.

1016
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:52,567
MARISHA: Okay. I give him back the armor.

1017
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:54,100
TALIESIN: No!

1018
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,341
MARISHA: Percy.

1019
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:56,345
TALIESIN: Not yet.

1020
01:24:56,345 --> 01:24:57,594
LIAM: I'm not taking it.

1021
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:00,962
TALIESIN: Thank you. Not yet.

1022
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:07,754
MARISHA: How long do we have you? What do you
remember? Anything?

1023
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:16,963
LIAM: Well, you can guess some of it.

1024
01:25:16,963 --> 01:25:19,466
MARISHA: No, we fucking can't!

1025
01:25:19,466 --> 01:25:22,113
LAURA: We have no fucking idea what's going on.

1026
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:27,208
MARISHA: As far as I'm concerned, you can drop
dead in front of our faces right now, and it

1027
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:31,573
wouldn't be much different than the past 24
hours.

1028
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:34,830
LIAM: You all have seen her, the same as I have.

1029
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,464
LAURA: We haven't talked to her like you have.

1030
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,204
MARISHA: We saw her face.

1031
01:25:38,204 --> 01:25:43,979
LAURA: What did she say? Did she send you back?
Did she say, "oh, you're going to be undead."

1032
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:48,469
LIAM: She did not say I'm a fucking ghoul.

1033
01:25:48,469 --> 01:26:02,698
ASHLEY: Vax, you're going to be okay. Take my
hand. This is going to be okay. We're going to

1034
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:03,723
figure this out.

1035
01:26:03,723 --> 01:26:05,262
LIAM: Yeah.

1036
01:26:05,262 --> 01:26:06,779
TRAVIS: Where did everybody go?

1037
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:08,152
SAM: Good morning!

1038
01:26:08,152 --> 01:26:09,413
ASHLEY: Grog.

1039
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:11,628
MARISHA: Surprise.

1040
01:26:11,628 --> 01:26:13,737
TRAVIS: What? I go down.

1041
01:26:13,737 --> 01:26:18,565
LIAM: Hey. What's up, Poobah?

1042
01:26:18,565 --> 01:26:20,546
TRAVIS: Is this real?

1043
01:26:20,546 --> 01:26:22,106
TALIESIN: We're not sure.

1044
01:26:22,106 --> 01:26:23,774
LAURA: We're figuring it out.

1045
01:26:23,774 --> 01:26:25,373
LIAM: Ooh.

1046
01:26:25,373 --> 01:26:27,204
TRAVIS: I need to pee.

1047
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:30,142
SAM: I come down and join everybody.

1048
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:33,363
LIAM: Hi.

1049
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:41,383
SAM: I look in my pocket to where I was keeping
the dust that was Vax. Is there anything there?

1050
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:42,966
MATT: Still filled with dust.

1051
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:45,521
LIAM: What is that?

1052
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:46,802
SAM: This is you.

1053
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:48,308
LAURA: Oh fuck.

1054
01:26:48,308 --> 01:26:51,575
LIAM: What?

1055
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:56,560
TALIESIN: Let's not even begin to have this
discussion if we don't have to.

1056
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,908
SAM: I feel like I should still keep this.

1057
01:26:58,908 --> 01:27:03,089
ASHLEY: Keep it just in case. I'm going to cast
Turn Undead.

1058
01:27:03,089 --> 01:27:05,059
MATT: You Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.

1059
01:27:05,059 --> 01:27:07,557
MARISHA: Wait. What?

1060
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:13,429
MATT: As you say that, she takes her holy symbol
and clutches it, and you watch as there's this divine

1061
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:19,356
flash and this emanating force, this low
hum. As it billows out, and you've seen her use it

1062
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:26,850
before. Clutching Vax in your hand, you feel the
warmth pass over you. No seeming effect.

1063
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:36,205
ASHLEY: Vax, I don't know how you did it, or how
she did it, but something's happened.

1064
01:27:36,205 --> 01:27:38,793
LIAM: She's like Sarenrae.

1065
01:27:38,793 --> 01:27:45,543
TALIESIN: I think that we can be physically
optimistic. Go.

1066
01:27:45,543 --> 01:27:48,932
LIAM: Pike, she's a god.

1067
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:54,422
ASHLEY: I've never seen anything like this before
in my life.

1068
01:27:54,422 --> 01:27:58,425
TALIESIN: We have to figure out where 
you came from, 'cause you're in a pouch.

1069
01:27:58,425 --> 01:28:00,169
ASHLEY: You're there, and you're here.

1070
01:28:00,169 --> 01:28:09,373
SAM: Wait, have we tried-- hey. Can you cut your
hand? Do you bleed?

1071
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:11,323
LIAM: Can someone lend me a knife?

1072
01:28:11,323 --> 01:28:15,503
MARISHA: I gave you back your armor and shit.

1073
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:16,953
LIAM: I didn't take it.

1074
01:28:16,953 --> 01:28:19,013
LAURA: I'm going to take Whisper and cut him.

1075
01:28:19,013 --> 01:28:21,976
MARISHA: He's got a cloak over him.

1076
01:28:21,976 --> 01:28:23,705
LAURA: I'm going to cut you right here.

1077
01:28:23,705 --> 01:28:26,874
MATT: You cut him. It's a sharp pain, and you
watch as it bleeds.

1078
01:28:26,874 --> 01:28:27,980
LAURA: Red?

1079
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,974
MATT: Yeah.

1080
01:28:28,974 --> 01:28:32,452
LAURA: Sorry. I cast Cure Wounds.

1081
01:28:32,452 --> 01:28:39,900
TALIESIN: This is looking better, all things
considered.

1082
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:49,975
LIAM: I don't know.

1083
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:55,710
LAURA: I'd already laid claim on your boots. I'd
come to grips with everything, and I'd decided I

1084
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,694
was going to wear them.

1085
01:28:57,694 --> 01:29:02,170
LIAM: I was about to tell you everything she told
me, but I've changed my mind.

1086
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,679
(laughter)

1087
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:06,569
TALIESIN: I'm going to fall down on the ground.

1088
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:09,540
SAM: How did this happen?

1089
01:29:09,807 --> 01:29:11,634
TRAVIS: I was asleep, and now you're here.

1090
01:29:11,634 --> 01:29:13,630
SAM: You made a deal with your god, or something?

1091
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:17,790
LIAM: Years ago.

1092
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,864
LAURA: Years ago?

1093
01:29:19,864 --> 01:29:23,247
LIAM: Year and a half ago.

1094
01:29:23,247 --> 01:29:27,099
ASHLEY: What did you say? What was your deal?

1095
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:38,863
MARISHA: You're here until the job's complete,
right? Or she feels that you've paid your service,

1096
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:47,337
I feel like I remember you telling me in bedside
chat at some point in time over the 15 months?

1097
01:29:47,337 --> 01:29:48,833
TALIESIN: TMI.

1098
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:51,994
TRAVIS: You need to work on your intimacy.
(laughs)

1099
01:29:51,994 --> 01:30:08,469
LIAM: She was a bit more specific. She doesn't
like our new play pal.

1100
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:09,817
LAURA: Vecna?

1101
01:30:09,817 --> 01:30:11,008
LIAM: Yeah.

1102
01:30:11,008 --> 01:30:13,085
LAURA: I know. She hates him.

1103
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:21,260
TALIESIN: Problem. We were not effective.

1104
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:26,406
LAURA: Was Keyleth right? If we defeat him, do you
go away?

1105
01:30:26,406 --> 01:30:36,151
ASHLEY: Or maybe you're free from that deal?

1106
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:39,051
SAM: If we defeat him, do you go away?

1107
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:41,911
MARISHA: Or is your soul yours again?

1108
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:53,781
LAURA: Just answer the question!

1109
01:30:53,781 --> 01:31:03,220
LIAM: It was death or come back and help you.

1110
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:09,577
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Oh shit.

1111
01:31:09,577 --> 01:31:13,827
SAM: So if we win, you lose.

1112
01:31:13,827 --> 01:31:21,334
LIAM: That's one way of looking at it.

1113
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:27,769
SAM: Well, that's a brave choice.

1114
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:30,363
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1115
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:36,437
MARISHA: Are her deals final?

1116
01:31:36,437 --> 01:31:49,287
LIAM: I don't have a lot of experience with other
gods making deals, darling. But I want you to live

1117
01:31:49,287 --> 01:32:02,912
a long time. And I want you two to live a long
time and be happy. And I want you to get a halfway

1118
01:32:02,912 --> 01:32:11,780
decent relationship with your daughter. I want you
to lead many people. I want you to change the

1119
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:17,161
world. I want you to do all the things I know you
can do. Forget it.

1120
01:32:17,161 --> 01:32:27,074
Grog, I just want you to be free.

1121
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:30,255
TRAVIS: Thank you, New Vax.

1122
01:32:30,255 --> 01:32:40,030
LIAM: So much better than the old Vax. Look, any
one of us could die at any time! We have died.

1123
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:45,541
Some of us more than once. It's a miracle that I'm
here now.

1124
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:47,821
LAURA: Put your armor on.

1125
01:32:47,821 --> 01:32:54,708
SAM: I don't mind it. It's fine.

1126
01:32:54,708 --> 01:33:01,441
MARISHA: So that's it? Your purpose is to make
sure that the rest of us find long, happy lives at

1127
01:33:01,441 --> 01:33:04,185
the cost of your own?

1128
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:10,533
LIAM: I've lived a very good life.

1129
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:16,544
LAURA: She's not my favorite anymore.

1130
01:33:16,544 --> 01:33:40,355
LIAM: And it's not just us. The dragons were a
test. This fucking lunatic, this dead thing. He's

1131
01:33:40,355 --> 01:33:44,023
not setting up a theme park, guys.

1132
01:33:44,023 --> 01:33:49,340
LAURA: We need to get back.

1133
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:52,138
MARISHA: We need to talk to the Raven Queen.

1134
01:33:52,138 --> 01:33:53,384
TALIESIN: We need a plan.

1135
01:33:53,384 --> 01:33:56,244
MARISHA: We need help.

1136
01:33:56,244 --> 01:33:58,898
TALIESIN: We do need help.

1137
01:33:58,898 --> 01:34:09,471
SAM: We have Vax now. No matter what happens
later, this was a brave choice. I'm not sure I

1138
01:34:09,471 --> 01:34:25,071
would have made the same, but we're stronger
together, and thank you for coming back. It's a

1139
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:37,858
harder choice to come back. It's easier to walk
away. I know this. Thank you for coming back.

1140
01:34:37,858 --> 01:34:44,256
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not like we have no agency,
right? We've been hit with bigger problems. We'll

1141
01:34:44,256 --> 01:34:46,647
work this one until we can't, anymore.

1142
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:49,684
TALIESIN: We'll all try and keep each other
alive.

1143
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,735
LIAM: Yeah.

1144
01:34:51,735 --> 01:34:54,319
MARISHA: I don't accept this as a closed
contract.

1145
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,334
TRAVIS: Yeah, me neither.

1146
01:34:58,334 --> 01:35:11,181
SAM: Maybe this will make you more fun to be
around, too. You used to have this death wish, but

1147
01:35:11,181 --> 01:35:16,217
now it's done. Now you pop a beer.

1148
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:19,659
LIAM: Don't set your expectations too high.

1149
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:24,998
TALIESIN: I was about to say, we can give him that
pouch, and then he could have perfect proof.

1150
01:35:24,998 --> 01:35:28,822
TRAVIS: If you wear clothes, is the deal null and
void?

1151
01:35:28,822 --> 01:35:31,014
LIAM: No, I have to be naked all the time.

1152
01:35:31,014 --> 01:35:39,693
MATT: It's interesting, Vax. As Scanlan says those
words, you realize--

1153
01:35:39,693 --> 01:35:41,288
TRAVIS: I have to be naked.

1154
01:35:41,288 --> 01:35:44,441
(laughter)

1155
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:46,754
MATT: It's part of your new multi-class.

1156
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:49,551
MARISHA: Does he get a bonus to AC?

1157
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:55,538
MATT: Level five paladin, level 12 rogue, level
one nudist.

1158
01:35:55,538 --> 01:35:59,833
(laughter)

1159
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:02,255
MATT: Unarmored defense. You had it, and now he
has it, too.

1160
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:04,778
MARISHA: Streaker's sprint.

1161
01:36:04,778 --> 01:36:10,937
MATT: The words he said about always having a
death wish, and now the death wish is over.

1162
01:36:10,937 --> 01:36:19,018
There's a strength in you, a confidence, an
assurance that wasn't there before. That fear of

1163
01:36:19,018 --> 01:36:29,219
death is gone. As he says that, for the first
time, while you raced towards death previously, it

1164
01:36:29,219 --> 01:36:44,233
was out of fear, and out of martyr-like purpose.
It's just confidence now. And that's where we're

1165
01:36:44,233 --> 01:36:45,657
going to take a break.

1166
01:36:45,657 --> 01:36:48,058
TRAVIS: Oh damn! Free Willy.

1167
01:36:48,058 --> 01:36:51,982
MATT: We'll be back here in just a minute. We'll
continue from here so we can get a drink and a

1168
01:36:51,982 --> 01:37:00,815
restroom break. We have our giveaway. Fantastic
zebrawood deck box from our friends at Wyrmwood.

1169
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:07,312
It's got a little card to tell you it's zebrawood.
One lucky winner's going to get this when we come

1170
01:37:07,312 --> 01:37:10,980
back from the break, so if you want to be part of
this giveaway, go over to the Twitch chat and

1171
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,502
enter when it's requested by the chat, enter the
word "raven."

1172
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:19,370
We'll have a winner for you when we get back.

1173
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,392
SAM and TRAVIS: That's so raven.

1174
01:37:21,392 --> 01:37:25,319
MATT: That's so raven, guys. All righty. Cool.
We'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

1175
01:37:25,319 --> 01:56:17,002
[break]

1176
01:56:17,002 --> 01:56:19,994
MATT: That's so late. You were so late on that.

1177
01:56:19,994 --> 01:56:24,139
LIAM: Change the rules of the game. Wait until the
countdown's done, then you say something foul.

1178
01:56:24,139 --> 01:56:33,214
MATT: Welcome, guys, back to Critical Role. The
chat room winner of our fantastic Wyrmwood deck

1179
01:56:33,214 --> 01:56:40,094
box is NightMist1. NightMist1, congratulations.
Denobo will contact you for your information, and

1180
01:56:40,094 --> 01:56:48,899
we'll get that to you asap. Well done. All righty,
everyone. So there, figuring out the scenario

1181
01:56:48,899 --> 01:56:57,080
revolving the return of Vax'ildan to Vox Machina,
and slowly learning some of the scenario around it

1182
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:02,373
and the discussions that took place. (burps)
Pardon.

1183
01:57:02,373 --> 01:57:04,463
(laughter)

1184
01:57:04,463 --> 01:57:06,686
TRAVIS: Battling it the last two seconds.

1185
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,574
SAM: It's his birthday. He can do whatever he
wants.

1186
01:57:08,574 --> 01:57:10,332
MATT: Goddamn right.

1187
01:57:10,332 --> 01:57:11,695
LAURA: That's going to be a t-shirt.

1188
01:57:11,695 --> 01:57:14,070
LIAM: I got this, I got this, (fake belch).

1189
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:25,231
MATT: I have no ego anymore. I learned early to
stomp that out. All righty, so as you put your

1190
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:29,901
equipment and armor back on, minus your haste
boots.

1191
01:57:29,901 --> 01:57:32,131
TRAVIS: And your other equipment away.

1192
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:35,955
LIAM: God, the grass is really cold.

1193
01:57:35,955 --> 01:57:38,729
LAURA: Here, you can have these old boots of
mine.

1194
01:57:38,729 --> 01:57:39,802
LIAM: Thank you.

1195
01:57:39,802 --> 01:57:44,565
SAM: Wow. Ice cold.

1196
01:57:44,565 --> 01:57:50,572
MARISHA: I admire how you're really sticking to
that. I'm in awe. I'm impressed.

1197
01:57:50,572 --> 01:57:52,716
SAM: It's super greedy.

1198
01:57:52,716 --> 01:57:54,933
(laughter)

1199
01:57:54,933 --> 01:57:56,992
LAURA: I thought we knew this about me already.

1200
01:57:56,992 --> 01:58:02,417
LIAM: These are better. They're Velcro.

1201
01:58:02,417 --> 01:58:03,869
SAM: Oh, good.

1202
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:08,216
TRAVIS: I think we should call out to the
werewolves.

1203
01:58:08,216 --> 01:58:11,970
SAM: You think we should call out to the
werewolves for what purpose?

1204
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:13,356
TRAVIS: We need diamonds.

1205
01:58:13,356 --> 01:58:15,305
LAURA: We don't need diamonds anymore.

1206
01:58:15,305 --> 01:58:20,974
TRAVIS: All last night, "we need diamonds." Huge
discussion. Took forever.

1207
01:58:20,974 --> 01:58:23,614
LAURA: We don't need them anymore.

1208
01:58:23,614 --> 01:58:26,794
TALIESIN: Then you suggested we sleep, and
suddenly we don't need diamonds anymore.

1209
01:58:26,794 --> 01:58:28,213
LIAM: Why did we need diamonds?

1210
01:58:28,213 --> 01:58:31,537
SAM: We were going to buy your soul back for a lot
of diamonds.

1211
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:33,929
LIAM: That makes no sense.

1212
01:58:33,929 --> 01:58:35,762
LAURA: It was a high-cost spell.

1213
01:58:35,762 --> 01:58:44,267
MARISHA: Attempt to resurrect you. Don't worry
about it.

1214
01:58:44,267 --> 01:58:47,931
LAURA: Good to know in the future, though. I'm
going to save every diamond we find.

1215
01:58:47,931 --> 01:58:52,795
TALIESIN: We should probably-- I get the distinct
impression this is--

1216
01:58:52,795 --> 01:58:55,378
TRAVIS: We should still call the werewolves.

1217
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:57,482
SAM: Just because?

1218
01:58:57,482 --> 01:59:01,674
TRAVIS: How often are you in the Feywild? It's
like going to Philadelphia

1219
01:59:01,674 --> 01:59:04,305
and not eating a cheesesteak.

1220
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:09,891
TALIESIN: We technically go to the Feywild about
once a year, at this point. At least, some of us.

1221
01:59:09,891 --> 01:59:18,216
But since we are here... I'm not going to pretend
I have a plan. I don't know what we're going to

1222
01:59:18,216 --> 01:59:21,146
do. We are frighteningly outmatched.

1223
01:59:21,146 --> 01:59:25,746
MARISHA: We should probably get back very quickly,
before too much time passes.

1224
01:59:25,746 --> 01:59:26,971
We've already slept here.

1225
01:59:26,971 --> 01:59:32,651
SAM: If we go back, where are we going? Where were
we?

1226
01:59:32,651 --> 01:59:36,086
LAURA: I feel like we were in Wildemount, but I
have no idea.

1227
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:38,321
Where are the places that are winter?

1228
01:59:38,321 --> 01:59:40,557
MARISHA: Vasselheim?

1229
01:59:40,557 --> 01:59:45,325
LIAM: We can't do this alone.

1230
01:59:45,325 --> 01:59:51,376
LAURA: What about Artagan? That's his name,
right?

1231
01:59:51,376 --> 01:59:52,682
LIAM: That's a start.

1232
01:59:52,682 --> 01:59:53,765
SAM: Who?

1233
01:59:53,765 --> 01:59:54,818
LAURA: Artagan.

1234
01:59:54,818 --> 01:59:59,897
MARISHA: The guy who messed with us for three
days?

1235
01:59:59,897 --> 02:00:01,247
LAURA: Yeah, but he was really powerful.

1236
02:00:01,247 --> 02:00:08,911
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. He was. I bet if we call the
werewolves, he will show up, as well. I'll just

1237
02:00:08,911 --> 02:00:10,312
howl for them real quick.

1238
02:00:10,312 --> 02:00:13,783
TALIESIN: It's not like we can stop you.

1239
02:00:13,783 --> 02:00:16,846
TRAVIS: True. (howls)

1240
02:00:16,846 --> 02:00:20,035
MATT: Make a performance check.

1241
02:00:20,035 --> 02:00:23,442
(laughter)

1242
02:00:23,442 --> 02:00:27,162
TRAVIS: Damn it! 13.

1243
02:00:27,162 --> 02:00:36,024
MATT: There isn't much space for it to really
echo, as the trees absorb a lot of the sound, but

1244
02:00:36,024 --> 02:00:40,120
you howl. It's cathartic. You wait. You don't hear
any response.

1245
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:44,697
TRAVIS: I love Teen Wolf. I know every line in
that fucking movie. Michael J. Fox.

1246
02:00:44,697 --> 02:00:51,873
LIAM: Artagan is a good start. We need...

1247
02:00:51,873 --> 02:00:55,071
LAURA: The help of the gods.

1248
02:00:55,071 --> 02:00:57,126
LIAM: Higher powers here, yes.

1249
02:00:57,126 --> 02:00:58,468
LAURA: Sarenrae.

1250
02:00:58,468 --> 02:01:00,086
LIAM: That's a start.

1251
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:04,058
ASHLEY: I can ask. That doesn't mean we're going
to get it.

1252
02:01:04,058 --> 02:01:07,160
LIAM: Pickle, I actually mean a little more than
that.

1253
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:10,101
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

1254
02:01:10,101 --> 02:01:23,531
LIAM: Well, we have one god heavily in our corner,
but we need to go and beseech the help of others.

1255
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:31,630
We are not enough, in this instance. We need to
fucking go and talk to Sarenrae.

1256
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:33,577
SAM: Go?

1257
02:01:33,577 --> 02:01:36,269
LAURA: How do we go and talk to Sarenrae?
Vasselheim?

1258
02:01:36,269 --> 02:01:37,993
MARISHA: Is it possible?

1259
02:01:37,993 --> 02:01:39,963
LAURA: Where is Sarenrae?

1260
02:01:39,963 --> 02:01:43,452
ASHLEY: You have a very different connection with
your god.

1261
02:01:43,452 --> 02:01:45,406
LIAM: You can take us anywhere.

1262
02:01:45,406 --> 02:01:51,993
LAURA: What, a plane? A heaven plane? A god
plane?

1263
02:01:51,993 --> 02:01:53,245
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1264
02:01:53,245 --> 02:01:56,215
TRAVIS: That doesn't exist, right?

1265
02:01:56,215 --> 02:02:01,742
LIAM: The gods? You don't think the gods exist,
after all you've seen, Grog?

1266
02:02:01,742 --> 02:02:06,081
TRAVIS: That's a very long discussion, but I meant
actual location for them.

1267
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:11,870
MARISHA: I thought gods were supposed to be all
omnipresent and whatnot.

1268
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:15,518
ASHLEY: 19.

1269
02:02:15,518 --> 02:02:27,264
MATT: 19. The creator gods, the prime gods, the
creators of Exandria, when they left the Prime

1270
02:02:27,264 --> 02:02:35,514
Material Plane and left the realm of the elemental
planes and the divine gate was crafted to separate

1271
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:42,980
their powers from the Prime Material for fear of
causing another calamity and wiping out mortal

1272
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:51,187
existence on this realm, many of them withdrew and
crafted realms where they reside, where they,

1273
02:02:51,187 --> 02:02:59,852
themselves, harness their energies of creation and
where the souls that fall under their spheres of

1274
02:02:59,852 --> 02:03:04,591
influence come to upon being passed. The Raven
Queen is responsible for ushering that transition.

1275
02:03:04,591 --> 02:03:12,314
You do know that Sarenrae exists on a plane like
this, and she's not the only god that exists on

1276
02:03:12,314 --> 02:03:16,356
this one particular plane.

1277
02:03:16,356 --> 02:03:20,128
LAURA: So how do we go there? Would they kill us?

1278
02:03:20,128 --> 02:03:25,695
MARISHA: Knock, knock, hello? I bamfed into your
universe. I don't know.

1279
02:03:25,695 --> 02:03:29,395
TALIESIN: We wouldn't come by if it weren't an
emergency.

1280
02:03:29,395 --> 02:03:33,522
LIAM: What else have we been doing for the last
year and a half but knocking on different

1281
02:03:33,522 --> 02:03:35,091
dimensional doors?

1282
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:38,471
MARISHA: I do like New Vax's tenacity.

1283
02:03:38,471 --> 02:03:51,497
SAM: Would we be accepted there? I've done some
things in my life that are less than heavenly.

1284
02:03:51,497 --> 02:03:56,922
LIAM: Where could you not talk your way into,
Scanlan Shorthalt?

1285
02:03:56,922 --> 02:03:58,298
SAM: That's true.

1286
02:03:58,298 --> 02:04:04,834
MARISHA: It does immediately become the concern
that I can't get us anywhere unless I have some

1287
02:04:04,834 --> 02:04:14,206
sort of item, generally a tuning fork or some sort
of attuned item to that plane to get us there.

1288
02:04:14,206 --> 02:04:15,989
LIAM: We start in Vasselheim.

1289
02:04:15,989 --> 02:04:23,421
MARISHA: You said your god, the Raven Queen, she's
the one who transitions people.

1290
02:04:23,421 --> 02:04:25,025
Maybe she can help.

1291
02:04:25,025 --> 02:04:29,036
LAURA: Does Pike have anything attuned to
Sarenrae, though?

1292
02:04:29,036 --> 02:04:36,617
LIAM: Oh, to Sarenrae? I don't think they're in
the same place.

1293
02:04:36,617 --> 02:04:38,720
MATT: Ashley, were you about to ask a question?

1294
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:42,533
ASHLEY: Shit, what was I going to say?

1295
02:04:42,533 --> 02:04:45,282
SAM: Is her symbol attuned?

1296
02:04:45,282 --> 02:04:52,076
MATT: Being attuned to a deity isn't being attuned
to a plane of existence, and those things can be--

1297
02:04:52,076 --> 02:04:58,750
the attunement process. You don't know much about
what that would entail, but you imagine that would

1298
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:02,367
have something to do with a place of very strong
holy worship of that particular deity.

1299
02:05:02,367 --> 02:05:10,306
LIAM: I'm going to assume that sometime in the
last year and a half, these two have told you that

1300
02:05:10,306 --> 02:05:13,447
I dipped into a bathtub full of blood.

1301
02:05:13,447 --> 02:05:16,514
SAM: I was gone.

1302
02:05:16,514 --> 02:05:18,220
LAURA: No, you weren't.

1303
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:30,851
LIAM: You just weren't paying attention, buddy.
The temples in Vasselheim are old. The oldest,

1304
02:05:30,851 --> 02:05:40,616
including the temple that you helped pull out of
the dirt. If anywhere is attuned to the gods, it

1305
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:41,997
is Vasselheim.

1306
02:05:41,997 --> 02:05:45,100
TRAVIS: Ooh! What about Kord? I'm wearing his oven
mitts.

1307
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:47,716
LIAM: There you go.

1308
02:05:47,716 --> 02:05:49,130
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1309
02:05:49,130 --> 02:05:52,386
MARISHA: Does that mean I should go talk to
Melora?

1310
02:05:52,386 --> 02:05:59,659
TRAVIS: Are we straight-up god recruiting? Is that
what you mean? Do gods talk to each other?

1311
02:05:59,659 --> 02:06:04,094
LAURA: Yeah, the Raven Queen and Sarenrae are best
buds, aren't they?

1312
02:06:04,094 --> 02:06:08,860
MARISHA: I feel like when you're in the same
clique, when you're on the same level,

1313
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:10,619
everyone talks, right?

1314
02:06:10,619 --> 02:06:12,764
LAURA: It's a small group of people. They have
to.

1315
02:06:12,764 --> 02:06:16,183
TALIESIN: I think what Vax is trying to say is we
need patrons.

1316
02:06:16,183 --> 02:06:17,724
LAURA: Patrons.

1317
02:06:17,724 --> 02:06:19,201
TALIESIN: We need patronage.

1318
02:06:19,201 --> 02:06:21,827
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

1319
02:06:21,827 --> 02:06:29,569
TALIESIN: We're not enough. We are not enough for
this. We are going to all die horribly if we try

1320
02:06:29,668 --> 02:06:31,405
anything like that again.

1321
02:06:31,405 --> 02:06:35,390
TRAVIS: We need them with us, or they're going to
imbue us--

1322
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:37,070
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1323
02:06:37,070 --> 02:06:39,340
LIAM: Pelor lives here.

1324
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:42,507
LAURA: Lives here in the Feywild?

1325
02:06:42,507 --> 02:06:46,015
LIAM: Pelor.

1326
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:48,234
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1327
02:06:48,234 --> 02:06:54,663
LIAM: All of us, your family.

1328
02:06:54,663 --> 02:06:58,669
TALIESIN: We have to deal with this.

1329
02:06:58,669 --> 02:07:02,339
MARISHA: So we have a short list, is what we're
saying.

1330
02:07:02,339 --> 02:07:08,794
TALIESIN: We need to get a slightly longer list,
and we have to start begging. We are going to owe

1331
02:07:08,794 --> 02:07:11,810
favors. We are going to owe our lives. We are
going to lose.

1332
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:15,948
LAURA: Are we really going to pledge allegiance to
a bunch of different gods?

1333
02:07:15,948 --> 02:07:18,301
That's what we're going to do?

1334
02:07:18,301 --> 02:07:20,479
TRAVIS: That could be cool.

1335
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:21,537
TALIESIN: We'll see.

1336
02:07:21,537 --> 02:07:28,723
MARISHA: Do we each get different suits, matching
suits, but in different colors? God powers?

1337
02:07:28,723 --> 02:07:32,485
TRAVIS: No, you're taking it too-- relax a little.
Do you want some ale?

1338
02:07:32,485 --> 02:07:34,075
LAURA: Like Captain Planet?

1339
02:07:34,075 --> 02:07:40,460
TRAVIS: Who's your god going to be? Is there a god
of mischief or song or cubes?

1340
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,471
MATT: Make a religion check.

1341
02:07:42,471 --> 02:07:52,246
SAM: A religion check? 14. Do I add my
jack-of-all?

1342
02:07:52,246 --> 02:07:53,507
MATT: Yeah, you do.

1343
02:07:53,507 --> 02:07:54,980
SAM: 17.

1344
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:57,107
MATT: 17. There is the Moon Weaver.

1345
02:07:57,107 --> 02:07:59,144
SAM: The Moon Weaver?

1346
02:07:59,144 --> 02:08:02,947
TRAVIS: (singing) Oh, moon weaver!

1347
02:08:02,947 --> 02:08:13,581
MATT: She is the god of moonlight and the autumn
season, as well as the patron of

1348
02:08:13,581 --> 02:08:15,507
illusions and misdirection.

1349
02:08:15,507 --> 02:08:17,284
LAURA: Who is that?

1350
02:08:17,284 --> 02:08:23,402
SAM: The Moon Weaver. A god that I've heard of
once, and therefore will pledge my eternal

1351
02:08:23,402 --> 02:08:24,982
allegiance to.

1352
02:08:24,982 --> 02:08:26,317
LAURA: You did?

1353
02:08:26,317 --> 02:08:29,179
SAM: No, we're god-spitballing here.

1354
02:08:29,179 --> 02:08:32,606
LAURA: The Moon Weaver? They have a temple to her
in Syngorn.

1355
02:08:32,606 --> 02:08:35,137
SAM: I have an Ioun Stone.

1356
02:08:35,137 --> 02:08:38,007
MATT: Ioun.

1357
02:08:38,007 --> 02:08:40,125
LAURA: Ioun is the goddess of knowledge.

1358
02:08:40,125 --> 02:08:41,957
MARISHA: Put her on our to-call list.

1359
02:08:41,957 --> 02:08:48,329
SAM: But I've been praying to Sarenrae lately.

1360
02:08:48,329 --> 02:09:00,353
ASHLEY: What if I were to channel divinity and try
to make a prayer and be like, hey, can we come up

1361
02:09:00,353 --> 02:09:02,449
there right quick?

1362
02:09:02,449 --> 02:09:09,274
MARISHA: Is it better to do that here or on the
Prime Material Plane? Or does it really matter?

1363
02:09:09,274 --> 02:09:10,574
ASHLEY: I don't know.

1364
02:09:10,574 --> 02:09:12,168
SAM: They don't care, right?

1365
02:09:12,168 --> 02:09:13,538
LIAM: Let's go back to your temple.

1366
02:09:13,538 --> 02:09:18,559
TALIESIN: We also probably want to alert the
mortal coil that everything has gone to shit.

1367
02:09:18,559 --> 02:09:23,866
MARISHA: Also, the longer we're here, potentially,
the more time gets wonky.

1368
02:09:23,866 --> 02:09:26,096
LIAM: We're on a ticking clock, here.

1369
02:09:26,096 --> 02:09:27,975
LAURA: Let's go to Vasselheim.

1370
02:09:27,975 --> 02:09:34,463
ASHLEY: I like this idea. It's a little crazy, but
I like it.

1371
02:09:34,463 --> 02:09:38,409
SAM: We should start with one god and see how it
goes.

1372
02:09:38,409 --> 02:09:43,017
LAURA: Start with one that really likes you. So
Sarenrae's a good call there.

1373
02:09:43,017 --> 02:09:45,021
ASHLEY: We'll work our way through in a montage.

1374
02:09:45,021 --> 02:09:46,825
LIAM: Worked for me.

1375
02:09:46,825 --> 02:09:48,323
ASHLEY: A god-tage.

1376
02:09:48,323 --> 02:09:50,964
TRAVIS: Do we hold hands?

1377
02:09:50,964 --> 02:09:54,665
SAM: Do we all get tattoos? (singing) We need a
god-tage!

1378
02:09:54,665 --> 02:09:56,908
ASHLEY and LAURA: Vasselheim.

1379
02:09:56,908 --> 02:09:58,311
MATT: To Vasselheim.

1380
02:09:58,311 --> 02:09:59,938
SAM: Wait, we're just going to go?

1381
02:09:59,938 --> 02:10:04,928
LAURA: Wait, we didn't talk to Artagan. Artagan,
are you here?

1382
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,773
LIAM: Is that how it works?

1383
02:10:06,773 --> 02:10:10,018
LAURA: Can you hear us? Do you want to help us?

1384
02:10:10,018 --> 02:10:13,395
TALIESIN: Maybe if we do something even stupider
than holding hands in a circle.

1385
02:10:13,395 --> 02:10:15,291
TRAVIS: Did any werewolves show up?

1386
02:10:15,291 --> 02:10:16,603
MATT: No.

1387
02:10:16,603 --> 02:10:18,671
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

1388
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:20,384
LAURA: Right as we go, I start howling.

1389
02:10:20,384 --> 02:10:22,365
(howling)

1390
02:10:22,365 --> 02:10:29,710
MATT: And with a singular howl, you all shift out
of the Feywild and then rapidly appear right on

1391
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:39,994
the outskirts of the outer wall of Vasselheim. You
see the large, almost Sumerian-looking structures

1392
02:10:39,994 --> 02:10:45,109
and walls that surround the outside. The ancient
architecture of the place definitely has the

1393
02:10:45,109 --> 02:10:51,521
oldest look, and you remember seeing it from the
top when you flew in through your first skyship

1394
02:10:51,521 --> 02:10:58,606
arrival into Vasselheim. The snow-covered ground
and snow-covered trees as

1395
02:10:58,606 --> 02:11:00,272
part of the Vesper Timberland.

1396
02:11:00,272 --> 02:11:07,700
MARISHA: I immediately look around in a 360, very
quickly. Does there look like any big cities that

1397
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:09,369
should not be here?

1398
02:11:09,369 --> 02:11:11,392
MATT: You can make a perception check.

1399
02:11:11,392 --> 02:11:14,820
LIAM: Is there a city on top of the city?

1400
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:17,257
MARISHA: 19.

1401
02:11:17,257 --> 02:11:25,273
MATT: As you arrive, there's a weird fuzziness in
your mind in regards to--

1402
02:11:25,273 --> 02:11:29,797
LAURA: Oh shit. Oh god, what if it's been years?

1403
02:11:29,797 --> 02:11:33,597
MATT: I would like all of you guys to make a
wisdom saving throw, please.

1404
02:11:33,597 --> 02:11:35,273
MARISHA: What?

1405
02:11:35,273 --> 02:11:36,913
LAURA: We could lose our memories!

1406
02:11:36,913 --> 02:11:38,269
MARISHA: Wisdom saving throws?

1407
02:11:38,269 --> 02:11:39,391
MATT: Yes.

1408
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:41,065
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

1409
02:11:41,065 --> 02:11:47,359
LAURA: We're immune to that, right? People with
fey ancestry?

1410
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:48,975
LIAM: No, it's charm or sleep.

1411
02:11:48,975 --> 02:11:51,847
MATT: Creatures who have fey ancestry are immune
to it, yeah.

1412
02:11:51,847 --> 02:11:53,985
LIAM: Damn it! I used luck and I rolled the same
thing on both.

1413
02:11:53,985 --> 02:11:55,395
MATT: You're immune.

1414
02:11:55,395 --> 02:11:57,232
LIAM: For charm and sleep?

1415
02:11:57,232 --> 02:12:00,477
MATT: If you have the fey ancestry trait, you're
immune.

1416
02:12:00,477 --> 02:12:02,754
TALIESIN: I had to burn a resolve.

1417
02:12:02,754 --> 02:12:04,072
MARISHA: Am I?

1418
02:12:04,072 --> 02:12:05,824
LAURA: Yeah, you have it, too. You're a half-elf.

1419
02:12:05,824 --> 02:12:07,300
MATT: Saving throw, yes.

1420
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,415
ASHLEY: I have advantage because of gnome
cunning?

1421
02:12:09,415 --> 02:12:14,215
MATT: It's not a spell or magical effect. It's a
planar effect, so I'd say no. What did you get?

1422
02:12:14,215 --> 02:12:15,226
ASHLEY: 14.

1423
02:12:15,226 --> 02:12:16,450
MATT: 14.

1424
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:17,583
TRAVIS: Eight.

1425
02:12:17,583 --> 02:12:19,519
SAM: Can I inspire myself?

1426
02:12:19,519 --> 02:12:24,646
MATT: Yeah. No, can you do it on a saving throw?

1427
02:12:24,646 --> 02:12:27,579
SAM: I don't know. It's ability checks, only.

1428
02:12:27,579 --> 02:12:34,484
MATT: I think it's just ability checks. Let me
check, just to be safe.

1429
02:12:34,484 --> 02:12:37,740
TALIESIN: I burned a resolve. I've got to make
sure that I can use the resolve.

1430
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:39,244
MATT: Yeah, ability checks.

1431
02:12:39,244 --> 02:12:40,177
SAM: Nine.

1432
02:12:40,177 --> 02:12:41,248
MATT: Nine?

1433
02:12:41,248 --> 02:12:45,014
TALIESIN: Can I use resolve on this? Okay, in that
case, 20.

1434
02:12:45,014 --> 02:12:52,089
MATT: Okay, so as you guys all arrive on the
outside of Vasselheim, the cold air hits you.

1435
02:12:52,089 --> 02:13:02,109
Grog, Scanlan: Vax is there alive in front of
you.

1436
02:13:02,109 --> 02:13:03,817
SAM: Holy shit.

1437
02:13:03,817 --> 02:13:08,254
MATT: The last thing you saw was him turn to dust,
and you guys left the Shadowfell, and then from

1438
02:13:08,254 --> 02:13:13,325
the Shadowfell and this battle, you've just now
returned, not as wounded as you were before.

1439
02:13:13,325 --> 02:13:20,740
SAM: What happened? What's going on? Where are we?
Who am I? What happened? What's going on?

1440
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:22,087
TRAVIS: I have to pee.

1441
02:13:22,087 --> 02:13:25,269
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, bringing it back.

1442
02:13:25,269 --> 02:13:28,366
LAURA: Didn't you lose your memory last time? Did
we ever realize that

1443
02:13:28,366 --> 02:13:29,921
you lost your memory the last time?

1444
02:13:29,921 --> 02:13:31,138
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1445
02:13:31,138 --> 02:13:34,655
(laughter)

1446
02:13:34,655 --> 02:13:36,297
TRAVIS: Are you real?

1447
02:13:36,297 --> 02:13:38,384
TALIESIN: He is abundantly real.

1448
02:13:38,384 --> 02:13:41,661
ASHLEY: Can I Greater Restoration them?

1449
02:13:41,661 --> 02:13:44,023
LAURA: Is that how we did it before?

1450
02:13:44,023 --> 02:13:46,056
ASHLEY: I don't know how you did it before because
I don't think I was here.

1451
02:13:46,056 --> 02:13:47,897
TRAVIS: This is weird for you, right?

1452
02:13:47,897 --> 02:13:51,221
SAM: Totally. He was dead a second ago. Now he's
alive.

1453
02:13:51,221 --> 02:13:53,543
TRAVIS: Is there still dust in your pocket?

1454
02:13:53,543 --> 02:13:58,546
MATT: Anything that can end a curse works for it.

1455
02:13:58,546 --> 02:14:08,571
SAM: I draw my whip. I whip him in the face. I'm
whipping Vax.

1456
02:14:08,571 --> 02:14:11,201
LAURA: What are you doing? Scanlan, stop it! Stop
it!

1457
02:14:11,201 --> 02:14:14,524
SAM: He's not real. He's an illusion. He's an
illusion!

1458
02:14:14,524 --> 02:14:17,090
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

1459
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:18,286
SAM: Two!

1460
02:14:18,286 --> 02:14:19,685
(laughter)

1461
02:14:19,685 --> 02:14:23,238
SAM: Oh, my eye! Why does my eye hurt so much?

1462
02:14:23,238 --> 02:14:25,903
(laughter)

1463
02:14:25,903 --> 02:14:30,772
TRAVIS: What's with your eye?

1464
02:14:30,772 --> 02:14:33,253
SAM: I don't know! It shouldn't have hurt that
much.

1465
02:14:33,253 --> 02:14:37,654
LIAM: We'll call this a victory for you. You have
won this day. Scanlan Shorthalt is your name.

1466
02:14:37,654 --> 02:14:39,299
We're in Vasselheim.

1467
02:14:39,299 --> 02:14:40,663
SAM: We are?

1468
02:14:40,663 --> 02:14:41,958
LIAM: We're in Vasselheim.

1469
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:43,367
SAM: We were just fighting a god.

1470
02:14:43,367 --> 02:14:47,919
ASHLEY: We were in the Feywild for a little while,
and then took a nap there, and then we came here.

1471
02:14:47,919 --> 02:14:51,775
MARISHA: In the long run, I think this is going to
be better for you.

1472
02:14:51,775 --> 02:14:56,808
MATT: Scanlan, as this is happening, Pike walks up
and touches her hand on you, and there's a flash

1473
02:14:56,808 --> 02:15:00,755
of warm energy through your body, and suddenly the
memories rush back to you from the Feywild.

1474
02:15:00,755 --> 02:15:02,208
SAM: Oh god.

1475
02:15:02,208 --> 02:15:03,947
LAURA: That's why your eye hurts.

1476
02:15:03,947 --> 02:15:07,511
SAM: His testicles hung so low!

1477
02:15:07,511 --> 02:15:09,239
TRAVIS: What?

1478
02:15:09,239 --> 02:15:10,619
LIAM: Mine, or Vecna's?

1479
02:15:10,619 --> 02:15:12,381
SAM: Yours.

1480
02:15:12,381 --> 02:15:16,560
LAURA: Vecna was wearing a big dress, so we
probably could have seen his balls.

1481
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:21,176
MATT: Magical muumuu? Flying above the whole
time.

1482
02:15:21,176 --> 02:15:24,666
ASHLEY: I'll go over and touch Grog, too.

1483
02:15:24,666 --> 02:15:29,411
MATT: Okay. That's two Greater Restorations. The
memory returns to you of the Feywild.

1484
02:15:29,411 --> 02:15:33,267
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh, I don't have to pee.

1485
02:15:33,267 --> 02:15:36,450
(laughter)

1486
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:38,891
TALIESIN: This makes me wonder if you've been doing
it wrong this whole time.

1487
02:15:38,891 --> 02:15:41,179
LIAM: It's whenever he remembers.

1488
02:15:41,179 --> 02:15:53,213
MATT: Vax. You feel this small, pounding headache
in your head. It's a very faint burn.

1489
02:15:53,213 --> 02:15:55,371
LIAM: I actually have this.

1490
02:15:55,371 --> 02:16:03,235
MATT: Yeah. You shake your head, and it changes in
your head, based on where you're facing.

1491
02:16:03,235 --> 02:16:07,134
TRAVIS and LAURA: What?

1492
02:16:07,134 --> 02:16:08,817
LIAM: Duskmeadow?

1493
02:16:08,817 --> 02:16:19,467
MATT: No. It's... make a survival check to try and
figure out where

1494
02:16:19,467 --> 02:16:23,130
you are around the city of Vasselheim.

1495
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:26,697
LIAM: 19.

1496
02:16:26,697 --> 02:16:31,658
MATT: Okay. Based on looking at the placement of
the sun in the sky, looking at the mountain range

1497
02:16:31,658 --> 02:16:37,735
that this is built on the northern side of the
city, you get the sense that you guys are close to

1498
02:16:37,735 --> 02:16:42,919
the perfectly south side of Vasselheim, the
entrance that leads toward the Quad Roads in the

1499
02:16:42,919 --> 02:16:53,112
center. That burning sensation, it seems to be
localized. No matter where you turn your head,

1500
02:16:53,112 --> 02:17:03,941
it's pointing that direction, to the northwest of
your current location, and the more you

1501
02:17:03,941 --> 02:17:14,279
concentrate on it, the more you feel that hatred
and loathing curl and push in that direction. You

1502
02:17:14,279 --> 02:17:16,078
know what lies in that direction.

1503
02:17:16,078 --> 02:17:19,125
LIAM: Do I have a sense of distance, or just
direction?

1504
02:17:19,125 --> 02:17:22,648
MATT: Let me double-check.

1505
02:17:22,648 --> 02:17:25,166
LAURA: He knows where Vecna is?

1506
02:17:25,166 --> 02:17:26,466
SAM: Or something.

1507
02:17:26,466 --> 02:17:27,815
LAURA: Cool.

1508
02:17:27,815 --> 02:17:32,726
MATT: Let me double-check here, real fast.

1509
02:17:32,726 --> 02:17:35,988
LIAM: Vec-dar.

1510
02:17:35,988 --> 02:17:37,463
TALIESIN: Vecna-dar.

1511
02:17:37,463 --> 02:17:40,154
LIAM: What's your Vecna, Victor?

1512
02:17:40,154 --> 02:17:42,644
MATT: You know the distance, yeah.

1513
02:17:42,644 --> 02:17:44,090
SAM: You know the distance?

1514
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:55,054
MATT: You roughly know, about 350 miles from where
you stand, to the northwest.

1515
02:17:55,054 --> 02:17:58,085
350 to 400 miles northwest.

1516
02:17:58,085 --> 02:17:59,686
ASHLEY: She gave you a Vecna compass.

1517
02:17:59,686 --> 02:18:08,757
LAURA: That's badass. 350 miles. How far is that
from us right now? Where is that in distance?

1518
02:18:08,757 --> 02:18:11,544
SAM: Sonoma.

1519
02:18:11,544 --> 02:18:14,661
LAURA: Really? It's that close? Okay.

1520
02:18:14,661 --> 02:18:16,489
TRAVIS: It ain't close. It's eight hours.

1521
02:18:16,489 --> 02:18:21,360
LAURA: Eight-hour drive? Okay.

1522
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:25,044
SAM: Wait, are we taking the hybrid?

1523
02:18:25,044 --> 02:18:27,792
ASHLEY: Stop off, go to wine country.

1524
02:18:27,792 --> 02:18:31,099
MATT: It'll be fun.

1525
02:18:31,099 --> 02:18:36,247
LIAM: The burn that I feel. There's no question
what it is for him.

1526
02:18:36,247 --> 02:18:39,932
MATT: This is part of your charge. This was part
of the deal that you struck.

1527
02:18:39,932 --> 02:18:43,309
TRAVIS: What deal? You wanna tell us 
what deal it was?

1528
02:18:43,309 --> 02:18:45,347
LIAM: You don't hear any of that shit. It's in my
head.

1529
02:18:45,347 --> 02:18:47,034
TRAVIS: Okay.

1530
02:18:47,034 --> 02:18:50,762
MATT: You are the Raven Queen's homing missile.

1531
02:18:50,762 --> 02:18:53,049
TRAVIS: Fucking A.

1532
02:18:53,049 --> 02:18:55,149
LIAM: So I'm going to need those boots back.

1533
02:18:55,149 --> 02:18:56,446
LAURA: Why?

1534
02:18:56,446 --> 02:18:57,905
LIAM: Because I'm a missile.

1535
02:18:57,905 --> 02:18:59,928
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

1536
02:18:59,928 --> 02:19:05,999
LIAM: Well, you think about it. You think about
what you've done. I know you'll do the right

1537
02:19:05,999 --> 02:19:07,548
thing, eventually.

1538
02:19:07,548 --> 02:19:17,612
TRAVIS: I have a random thought. While y'all are
trying to go get Sarenrae, this is where the story of

1539
02:19:17,612 --> 02:19:23,843
the Lord of the Quad Roads is. If you're not
familiar with the Lord of the Quad Roads, he was a

1540
02:19:23,843 --> 02:19:30,026
gentleman that just very quickly came into fame
and fortune, and he's a personal friend of mine,

1541
02:19:30,026 --> 02:19:35,977
and I thought I might try and go find him for a
favor. You know, one of those people if you pop in

1542
02:19:35,977 --> 02:19:38,130
town, they get real pissed if you don't stop by.

1543
02:19:38,130 --> 02:19:39,620
LIAM: Is he a god?

1544
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:43,879
TRAVIS: Maybe? Could be. Not sure.

1545
02:19:43,879 --> 02:19:48,085
LIAM: We don't have a lot of time, so do you think
you could split off with somebody?

1546
02:19:48,085 --> 02:19:51,908
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll meet you up where we were.

1547
02:19:51,908 --> 02:19:53,521
SAM: Where are we going?

1548
02:19:53,521 --> 02:19:54,842
LAURA: To the temple of Sarenrae.

1549
02:19:54,842 --> 02:19:56,015
LIAM: To your temple.

1550
02:19:56,015 --> 02:20:00,942
TALIESIN: You may not want me in company for
Sarenrae.

1551
02:20:00,942 --> 02:20:07,291
LIAM: I'm pretty sure we want your brain around,
Percy. I know you're uncomfortable around all this

1552
02:20:07,291 --> 02:20:09,352
shit, but I want you to fucking suck it up.

1553
02:20:09,352 --> 02:20:12,131
TALIESIN: I just don't want to say the wrong
thing.

1554
02:20:12,131 --> 02:20:14,932
LAURA: I walk up to him and put my hands on the
sides of his face.

1555
02:20:14,932 --> 02:20:19,022
I can't have you away from me right now.

1556
02:20:19,022 --> 02:20:25,129
TALIESIN: This is a deeply-inappropriate
convincing mena-men-mechanism. It is working. All right.

1557
02:20:25,129 --> 02:20:27,911
SAM: She's beautiful.

1558
02:20:27,911 --> 02:20:30,257
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person!

1559
02:20:30,257 --> 02:20:31,859
LIAM: I mean, she's okay.

1560
02:20:31,859 --> 02:20:34,169
MARISHA: Do we need to stop by the temple of the
Raven Queen?

1561
02:20:34,169 --> 02:20:39,289
LIAM: I don't think we do.

1562
02:20:39,289 --> 02:20:42,164
LAURA: You just had a really long conversation
with her.

1563
02:20:42,164 --> 02:20:44,489
LIAM: I don't think we do.

1564
02:20:44,489 --> 02:20:46,648
MARISHA: Okay.

1565
02:20:46,648 --> 02:20:54,417
ASHLEY: To Sarenrae?

1566
02:20:54,417 --> 02:20:57,384
LIAM: Grog, are you splitting off?

1567
02:20:57,384 --> 02:21:00,609
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's real important.

1568
02:21:00,609 --> 02:21:04,670
LIAM: You can stay on task, though, right?

1569
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:07,606
TRAVIS: Yeah. I could just pop in, give him a
little fist bump, and I'll

1570
02:21:07,606 --> 02:21:09,823
meet you at Sarenrae's hovel.

1571
02:21:09,823 --> 02:21:11,339
MARISHA: Do you want a teammate to go with you?

1572
02:21:11,339 --> 02:21:13,031
LIAM: Yeah, I think you need a minder.

1573
02:21:13,031 --> 02:21:15,067
MARISHA: Do you want to pick someone?

1574
02:21:15,067 --> 02:21:16,673
TRAVIS: Fancy a trip?

1575
02:21:16,673 --> 02:21:17,955
SAM: With you, Grog?

1576
02:21:17,955 --> 02:21:18,935
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1577
02:21:18,935 --> 02:21:21,835
SAM: Just the two of us, wandering through a city
together?

1578
02:21:21,835 --> 02:21:24,887
TRAVIS: Yep. You know, totally behaving
ourselves.

1579
02:21:24,887 --> 02:21:26,750
LIAM: Do you see this?

1580
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:28,828
SAM: Do I see what?

1581
02:21:28,828 --> 02:21:31,203
LIAM: He's relaxed.

1582
02:21:31,203 --> 02:21:40,328
SAM: You're right. I should go with him. All
right, let's go. We'll see you at the temple.

1583
02:21:40,328 --> 02:21:44,327
Don't go to heaven without us.

1584
02:21:44,327 --> 02:21:45,821
LAURA: Of course not.

1585
02:21:45,821 --> 02:21:47,132
SAM: All right.

1586
02:21:47,132 --> 02:21:48,944
LAURA: Sarenrae's a big fan of the cube.

1587
02:21:48,944 --> 02:21:52,040
MARISHA: Where was the Melora grove thing?

1588
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,504
MATT: Oh, you're talking about the--

1589
02:21:53,504 --> 02:21:58,327
MARISHA: That we buried Senokir's wife's ashes.

1590
02:21:58,327 --> 02:22:03,487
MATT: You're referring to the Abundant Terrace,
within the Birth Heart.

1591
02:22:03,487 --> 02:22:04,979
MARISHA: Where is that?

1592
02:22:04,979 --> 02:22:08,313
MATT: The Birth Heart would be on the northeastern
side of the city.

1593
02:22:08,313 --> 02:22:09,507
MARISHA: But it's here?

1594
02:22:09,507 --> 02:22:10,618
MATT: Yeah.

1595
02:22:10,618 --> 02:22:18,340
MARISHA: Should I go talk to Melora? Should I go
try and recruit Melora?

1596
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:21,927
Team Sarenrae and Team Melora?

1597
02:22:21,927 --> 02:22:23,160
LIAM: Maybe.

1598
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:24,954
TALIESIN: Let's do one at a time.

1599
02:22:24,954 --> 02:22:26,238
LIAM: Yeah.

1600
02:22:26,238 --> 02:22:27,863
MARISHA: I'm just trying to save time.

1601
02:22:27,863 --> 02:22:31,919
TALIESIN: I think we're a bit beyond that, at this
point.

1602
02:22:31,919 --> 02:22:39,311
TRAVIS: Besides, we'd know if Old Shit Nuts is
moving closer because of--

1603
02:22:39,311 --> 02:22:48,131
LIAM: I just know what my patron charged me with.
That doesn't mean I understand what it means, so I

1604
02:22:48,131 --> 02:22:49,506
think we should start with one.

1605
02:22:49,506 --> 02:22:56,492
TALIESIN: We're eventually going to have to tell
somebody in charge what's happening. But to

1606
02:22:56,492 --> 02:22:59,036
Sarenrae! Let's get this ball rolling.

1607
02:22:59,036 --> 02:23:00,364
LAURA: Let's do it!

1608
02:23:00,364 --> 02:23:04,960
MATT: All right, so you two are splitting off and
the rest of you are going to Sarenrae? All right.

1609
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:11,175
The five of you make your way through the Quad
Roads, towards the northern side of the Quad Roads

1610
02:23:11,175 --> 02:23:15,035
before it splits off at the base of the mountain
and before it divides off towards the Abundant

1611
02:23:15,035 --> 02:23:23,156
Terrace and the Trial Forge. The Braving Grounds.
That is where you spent a lot of time raising the

1612
02:23:23,156 --> 02:23:30,470
temple of the Everlight, Sarenrae. Traversing
there on the cold day, the city seems to be as

1613
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:35,233
vibrant as ever, and as dour as ever, as is the
nature of those who live in these northern lands,

1614
02:23:35,233 --> 02:23:40,872
but you know, smiles and existence come together
occasionally. You come to the temple. It looks

1615
02:23:40,872 --> 02:23:49,161
well-kept. The various clerics and acolytes that
you had assigned to watch over it in your absence

1616
02:23:49,161 --> 02:23:55,145
over this past year and a half before you ventured
out to defeat the Conclave seem to have taken good

1617
02:23:55,145 --> 02:24:04,536
care, and it's warming to your heart to see what
appears to be children stepping out, laughing with

1618
02:24:04,536 --> 02:24:10,926
their parents in what seems to have been a small
service of some kind. And as you begin to watch

1619
02:24:10,926 --> 02:24:15,402
and approach, you can see the acolytes that are
saying goodbye to those at the front door glance

1620
02:24:15,402 --> 02:24:23,452
over and see your face, and they brighten
immediately. There you go, clear your nose.

1621
02:24:23,452 --> 02:24:31,293
Acolyte Sheila, who is one of the older women who
first helped you raise it and became one of your

1622
02:24:31,293 --> 02:24:35,904
first acolytes here at the temple. The temple
which is being known now as the Temple of Renewal.

1623
02:24:35,904 --> 02:24:45,732
It is the official title of the location, which is
taken from the realm of Sarenrae, known as the

1624
02:24:45,732 --> 02:24:55,710
Island of Renewal. As she sees your face, Acolyte
Sheila goes, "Pike! Mistress Pike!" And runs up

1625
02:24:55,710 --> 02:25:00,828
and takes you in her arms. She tries to lift you,
but you're far too heavy with the armor. (grunts)

1626
02:25:00,828 --> 02:25:04,946
ASHLEY: That's okay. I'm heavier than I look.

1627
02:25:04,946 --> 02:25:06,713
MATT: "Yes, of course."

1628
02:25:06,713 --> 02:25:08,565
ASHLEY: Pure muscle.

1629
02:25:08,565 --> 02:25:15,735
MATT: You guys see this woman in probably her
late-forties or early-fifties, mostly gray-silver

1630
02:25:15,735 --> 02:25:22,652
hair with streaks and bits of a dark brown. It's
put back in some sort of a bun with a large stick

1631
02:25:22,652 --> 02:25:29,442
through the center to hold it in place. She's wearing
robes of light blue and gold, very much in the way

1632
02:25:29,442 --> 02:25:38,025
that you've seen Pike wear most of her equipment
and earlier armor to her deity. She looks around.

1633
02:25:38,025 --> 02:25:49,623
"Well, my apologies. I am Sheila, and I know who
you are. We've heard much. You are welcome. You

1634
02:25:49,623 --> 02:25:53,713
"are welcome here at the Temple of Renewal. Please
come in."

1635
02:25:53,713 --> 02:25:58,817
ASHLEY: It looks lovely in here. You guys have
really kept it up quite nice.

1636
02:25:58,817 --> 02:26:07,452
MATT: "The hard part was already done. Come into
her light, please." And leads you all into this

1637
02:26:07,452 --> 02:26:17,270
tower. The excavation site here. What was once a
large pit, below which the original temple was,

1638
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:21,909
the edges have been ground down to be this slow
decline, and a tower was risen up. The actual

1639
02:26:21,909 --> 02:26:28,644
stonework was ascended about 15 feet up, so it's
not quite street level; it's a little below, but

1640
02:26:28,644 --> 02:26:33,723
it's this small bowl that leads to the tower
itself, and then it rises up a good 30 feet.

1641
02:26:33,723 --> 02:26:35,055
LAURA: You did this?

1642
02:26:35,055 --> 02:26:36,308
MARISHA: This is great, Pike.

1643
02:26:36,308 --> 02:26:37,612
LAURA: Holy shit!

1644
02:26:37,612 --> 02:26:39,085
ASHLEY: Not all by myself.

1645
02:26:39,085 --> 02:26:42,771
MARISHA: Is this how you learned all of your
stoneworking stuff?

1646
02:26:42,771 --> 02:26:43,703
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1647
02:26:43,703 --> 02:26:46,929
MARISHA: It's good, like a druid could do it. It's
very impressive.

1648
02:26:46,929 --> 02:26:48,461
ASHLEY: That's a compliment.

1649
02:26:48,461 --> 02:26:50,761
(laughter)

1650
02:26:50,761 --> 02:26:52,998
MARISHA: Good craftsmanship.

1651
02:26:52,998 --> 02:27:10,085
ASHLEY: Sheila. (sighs) We're trying to figure out
the best way to... what am I trying to say, here?

1652
02:27:10,085 --> 02:27:27,373
We're trying to go to Sarenrae, but actually go to
her. Not in the sense of the mind, actually

1653
02:27:27,373 --> 02:27:32,068
walking up and saying hello.

1654
02:27:32,068 --> 02:27:35,997
MARISHA: I didn't realize how crazy it sounds
until you say it out loud.

1655
02:27:35,997 --> 02:27:39,284
ASHLEY: When I started, I realized this is so
weird.

1656
02:27:39,284 --> 02:27:50,871
MATT: "That's a bit beyond my realm. Perhaps we
should speak to Acolyte Vincent Clore. He's the

1657
02:27:50,871 --> 02:27:58,318
"keeper of knowledge and scripture. He'd probably
be more help than I."

1658
02:27:58,318 --> 02:27:59,752
ASHLEY: Okay.

1659
02:27:59,752 --> 02:28:02,583
LAURA: Can you try just talking to Sarenrae?

1660
02:28:02,583 --> 02:28:09,305
ASHLEY: I could try. Of course, but maybe he will
know which plane she's on and we can head there.

1661
02:28:09,305 --> 02:28:15,448
Sometimes she doesn't talk to me. I can always
try, since we're in here.

1662
02:28:15,448 --> 02:28:17,075
MATT: What do you want to do?

1663
02:28:17,075 --> 02:28:20,764
ASHLEY: I'll go ahead and try. You know what? Let
me say a prayer real quick, Sheila.

1664
02:28:20,764 --> 02:28:23,254
LIAM: Want to take a knee, everybody?

1665
02:28:23,254 --> 02:28:26,081
ASHLEY: Percy, it's fine. You don't need to.

1666
02:28:26,081 --> 02:28:27,969
TALIESIN: No. In for a penny.

1667
02:28:27,969 --> 02:28:29,547
ASHLEY: Let's all take a knee.

1668
02:28:29,547 --> 02:28:39,048
MATT: The tower itself is a fairly wide tower. 30
feet high at street level. It's about 45 feet full

1669
02:28:39,048 --> 02:28:43,767
height from where the baseline rising it was and
the rest of the tower that's been assembled beyond

1670
02:28:43,767 --> 02:28:52,599
that. On the inside, there are four floors, all of
which have a hollow center about ten feet across,

1671
02:28:52,599 --> 02:28:59,703
for in the center of the entire tower is one long,
thin, ascending tower of what looks to be a

1672
02:28:59,703 --> 02:29:08,955
sculpture of stone and gold and platinum-colored
angels and clouds that all turn and twist. It

1673
02:29:08,955 --> 02:29:14,489
rises up like this thin spire of sculpture, and
there at the very top, you see the phoenix-like

1674
02:29:14,489 --> 02:29:22,611
wings clutching the ruby stone at the top, the
symbol of Sarenrae. As you step to the base of

1675
02:29:22,611 --> 02:29:29,212
this structure, which you haven't even seen
finished; you left before this was completed. It's

1676
02:29:29,212 --> 02:29:36,181
awe-inspiring to see this thing that you saw the
very early stages of come into creation, and now

1677
02:29:36,181 --> 02:29:42,474
it's strangely comforting to know that for all the
effort that you put in, for all the strange

1678
02:29:42,474 --> 02:29:48,137
responsibility you put on yourself, that none of
this would get done if you weren't there, it's

1679
02:29:48,137 --> 02:29:53,563
comforting to know that even without your
presence, it can carry on to completion. And that

1680
02:29:53,563 --> 02:30:00,591
as it is with worship, you don't need to helm it.
Once you give it a shove,

1681
02:30:00,591 --> 02:30:02,208
it carries itself forward.

1682
02:30:02,208 --> 02:30:10,891
You close your eyes and you kneel below at the
base of this amazing statue, one of the few only

1683
02:30:10,891 --> 02:30:17,192
standing to her direct worship of its size,
of any note to the world at this time.

1684
02:30:17,192 --> 02:30:21,988
What do you say as your prayer?

1685
02:30:21,988 --> 02:30:45,355
ASHLEY: Well, I'm back here, and this is so
beautiful. I'm sure you've seen and have... seen

1686
02:30:45,355 --> 02:30:58,665
what's happened where we were, and I know the last
time we talked, you warned me and told me that you

1687
02:30:58,665 --> 02:31:07,886
wouldn't be there, but I think we're past the
point of being able to do this on our own, just

1688
02:31:07,886 --> 02:31:32,671
our mortal selves, and we need bigger help. Might
I ask for (sighs) your-- please help us. I don't

1689
02:31:32,671 --> 02:31:36,891
know what else to say. This is beyond us now.

1690
02:31:36,891 --> 02:31:42,999
MATT: As the words leave your mouth, yourself
prostrate before the temple you helped build with

1691
02:31:42,999 --> 02:31:49,750
your own hands, you open your eyes, but you see
not the temple before you. You see, instead,

1692
02:31:49,750 --> 02:31:57,095
around you essences of a vision that have been
blurred at the edges, but now come clear. You see

1693
02:31:57,095 --> 02:32:08,615
around you sandy shores, pearlescent almost. White
sand that glitters in your presence, just at the

1694
02:32:08,615 --> 02:32:18,047
peripheral, glass gems, diamonds, you can't tell,
but the light that hits it seems to just sparkle

1695
02:32:18,047 --> 02:32:25,390
and give off this light. You hear water around you
rushing up and pulling back from the shore. You

1696
02:32:25,390 --> 02:32:33,761
see statues, so many statues before you, and one
that appears to be a glass fortress, a spire that

1697
02:32:33,761 --> 02:32:39,499
rises up crystalline, translucent, but seeming to
glow with the flicker of an internal flame's

1698
02:32:39,499 --> 02:32:51,517
heartbeat. As you look up at the top of the
temple, you see the wings unfurl, drift towards

1699
02:32:51,517 --> 02:32:58,704
you, and you see coming towards you the physical
form of the Everlight herself. Her darkened skin,

1700
02:32:58,704 --> 02:33:06,308
her beautiful smile, her light hair leaving a
trail of flame and gold and sunlight behind. She

1701
02:33:06,308 --> 02:33:22,762
comes forth and drifts right before you and says,
"Then the time is right for us to meet. Come. Come

1702
02:33:22,762 --> 02:33:35,361
"and join me on the Island of Renewal, within the
blessed fields of Elysium. Here, we can speak."

1703
02:33:35,361 --> 02:33:53,973
ASHLEY: I immediately take a knee. Thank you for
letting me come here. Just to see you, and-- we

1704
02:33:53,973 --> 02:33:55,995
will come to you.

1705
02:33:55,995 --> 02:34:11,301
MATT: Her hands reach out and clasp yours, and the
warmth of her touch is hot. You feel like it's

1706
02:34:11,301 --> 02:34:18,251
borderline burning, but it doesn't hurt. You
instinctually, that animalistic essence of primal

1707
02:34:18,251 --> 02:34:29,101
life tells you to pull back, but you don't. It's a
comforting heat, like holding a cup of fresh, hot

1708
02:34:29,101 --> 02:34:39,530
tea. She seems to almost lift you off the feet, up
to her. And her size, which was so vast and

1709
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:49,007
immense seems to come to meet yours one-on-one.
She goes, "Then come. You have the tools. You have

1710
02:34:49,007 --> 02:34:59,553
"the means. I await." And as she lets go, you look
down in your hand and you see what appears to be a

1711
02:34:59,553 --> 02:35:09,473
small little piece of curved metal made of a
bright, polished platinum, like a U. As you look

1712
02:35:09,473 --> 02:35:17,089
up to her again, you're just staring at the
statue. You're staring around the temple. You look

1713
02:35:17,089 --> 02:35:21,413
down at your hand, but the item remains.

1714
02:35:21,413 --> 02:35:26,150
MARISHA: She just gave us a key!

1715
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:28,007
LAURA: What happened?

1716
02:35:28,007 --> 02:35:29,360
ASHLEY: Did you guys see anything?

1717
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:33,344
LAURA: We saw you praying and you had this crazy
look in your eyes.

1718
02:35:33,344 --> 02:35:35,527
LIAM: You looked blissful.

1719
02:35:35,527 --> 02:35:37,499
LAURA: So happy.

1720
02:35:37,499 --> 02:35:53,118
ASHLEY: Wow! Well, I went there. I went to the
Island of Renewal; that's where she is. And she

1721
02:35:53,118 --> 02:35:55,968
gave this to me.

1722
02:35:55,968 --> 02:35:57,257
LAURA: What is it?

1723
02:35:57,257 --> 02:36:00,128
MARISHA: Do I recognize what it is?

1724
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:02,284
SAM: It's an IUD.

1725
02:36:02,284 --> 02:36:05,468
(laughter)

1726
02:36:05,468 --> 02:36:07,767
LAURA: You're not here!

1727
02:36:07,767 --> 02:36:11,052
LIAM: We all hear Scanlan Shorthalt's voice in our
minds.

1728
02:36:11,052 --> 02:36:15,190
ASHLEY: Over the earring. Shut up, Scanlan.

1729
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:17,997
MATT: Structurally similar, I suppose.

1730
02:36:17,997 --> 02:36:22,926
ASHLEY: No, it's not.

1731
02:36:22,926 --> 02:36:24,824
SAM: Of course not.

1732
02:36:24,824 --> 02:36:38,499
MATT: I can give, and I can take away. (laughs)
It's different in the designs that have been

1733
02:36:38,499 --> 02:36:44,835
crafted, that have been a little more crude. This
has, once you reach out and touch it, it has that

1734
02:36:44,835 --> 02:36:57,611
vibration to it, that hint of attuned activity to
the metal, the pure metal, that definitely gives

1735
02:36:57,611 --> 02:37:03,726
you some semblance of direction in your subtle
understanding of the inner and outer planes and

1736
02:37:03,726 --> 02:37:05,955
the general cosmology that surrounds Exandria.

1737
02:37:05,955 --> 02:37:08,964
LAURA: She gave us a key to find her.

1738
02:37:08,964 --> 02:37:14,436
MARISHA: She gave us a key to Plane Shift there.
This is the tuning fork that I needed.

1739
02:37:14,436 --> 02:37:17,159
LAURA: What the-- wow!

1740
02:37:17,159 --> 02:37:21,013
TALIESIN: Let's let people know.

1741
02:37:21,013 --> 02:37:28,112
ASHLEY: That was cool. Vax, you have a very
different relationship with your god, but--

1742
02:37:28,112 --> 02:37:35,705
awesome! That was cool!

1743
02:37:35,705 --> 02:37:37,276
LAURA: What was she like?

1744
02:37:37,276 --> 02:37:49,272
ASHLEY: She was so beautiful! And just glowed. No!
And I just can't even describe it, she just glowed

1745
02:37:49,272 --> 02:37:55,999
and it felt like-- do you remember the movie
Contact?

1746
02:37:55,999 --> 02:37:59,635
(laughter)

1747
02:37:59,635 --> 02:38:00,547
LAURA: Yeah!

1748
02:38:00,547 --> 02:38:01,903
SAM: You mean the old scroll?

1749
02:38:01,903 --> 02:38:06,799
ASHLEY: Yes, the old scroll Contact, where she
gets to the beach and her dad is there? That's

1750
02:38:06,799 --> 02:38:08,194
what it felt like!

1751
02:38:08,194 --> 02:38:12,286
LAURA: Wow!

1752
02:38:12,286 --> 02:38:18,755
ASHLEY: I need to go back there! Let's all go!

1753
02:38:18,755 --> 02:38:21,160
MARISHA: Hang on. Do other gods live there?

1754
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:24,251
MATT: Make a religion check.

1755
02:38:24,251 --> 02:38:30,549
LIAM: And we're waiting on a guy, too, aren't we?
The lady, Sheila, ran off--

1756
02:38:30,549 --> 02:38:31,737
ASHLEY: 23.

1757
02:38:31,737 --> 02:38:42,371
MATT: 23. She mentioned the blessed fields of
Elysium. Sarenrae, as you know, the general

1758
02:38:42,371 --> 02:38:48,222
understanding of her existence in the pantheon had
been faded for a while. There was a betrayal to

1759
02:38:48,222 --> 02:38:55,242
her in the Calamity and most of her following was
annihilated. As gods, as they currently exist,

1760
02:38:55,242 --> 02:39:01,710
their worship is what sustains their importance
and viability in the various planes. She

1761
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:14,735
diminished, so her location, her home, has been
kept from most existing scripture and worship both

1762
02:39:14,735 --> 02:39:19,791
for her protection and those of her followers. So
the existence of the Island of Renewal and where

1763
02:39:19,791 --> 02:39:24,928
it may be have only recently come to your
attention. The blessed fields of Elysium, though,

1764
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:30,540
they are a fairly well-known location in religious
circles, and is also home to the Fortress of the

1765
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:34,134
Sun, the home of Pelor, the Dawnfather.

1766
02:39:34,134 --> 02:39:35,726
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1767
02:39:35,726 --> 02:39:38,564
LAURA: That's convenient.

1768
02:39:38,564 --> 02:39:42,161
MATT: Different area on the plane. The Fortress of
the Sun.

1769
02:39:42,161 --> 02:39:45,554
LAURA: (singing) Fortress of the Sun.

1770
02:39:45,554 --> 02:39:52,369
MATT: The blessed fields of Elysium are an idyllic
plane of good.

1771
02:39:52,369 --> 02:39:58,402
LIAM: Are these things Pike knows because of her
expertise, or does everyone in the world know a

1772
02:39:58,402 --> 02:40:00,132
certain amount about?

1773
02:40:00,132 --> 02:40:05,172
MATT: They know the gods, and they know the
realms, but the name of the plane? This is known

1774
02:40:05,172 --> 02:40:13,647
to her because of her study of religion. This is
more of an academic understanding of the real

1775
02:40:13,647 --> 02:40:15,428
essence of the gods, where they come from.

1776
02:40:15,428 --> 02:40:20,657
ASHLEY: I didn't think it was going to work!
Sheila, I think--

1777
02:40:20,657 --> 02:40:25,782
MATT: Sheila begins to return two minutes later
with acolyte Vincent Clor, who's this

1778
02:40:25,782 --> 02:40:33,389
mousy-looking guy. His eyes are smaller than they
should be it seems for the size of his round face,

1779
02:40:33,389 --> 02:40:40,521
he comes up with a big toothy grin. "I was told
that you were seeking my presence,

1780
02:40:40,521 --> 02:40:43,728
"wonderful Mistress Pike."

1781
02:40:43,728 --> 02:40:51,305
ASHLEY: It's wonderful to see you, Vincent. I'm so
sorry she went to go get you. I think we might be

1782
02:40:51,305 --> 02:40:53,279
okay, and we got some answers.

1783
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:59,047
TALIESIN: We should probably tell them what's
going on. People should start to prepare

1784
02:40:59,047 --> 02:41:03,390
themselves for what's coming. We can't just keep
this to ourselves.

1785
02:41:03,390 --> 02:41:05,158
LAURA: This could affect everyone.

1786
02:41:05,158 --> 02:41:06,878
TALIESIN: This is going to affect everyone.

1787
02:41:06,878 --> 02:41:08,447
TRAVIS: (whispering) Tell no one

1788
02:41:08,447 --> 02:41:13,995
TALIESIN: You're not here! You went shopping.

1789
02:41:13,995 --> 02:41:18,156
SAM: We're in the House of Lady Favors of Renewal
right now.

1790
02:41:18,156 --> 02:41:19,875
MATT: I'll get to you guys in a moment.

1791
02:41:19,875 --> 02:41:25,877
ASHLEY: You, obviously, have heard of Vecna.

1792
02:41:25,877 --> 02:41:29,541
MATT: "No, I don't."

1793
02:41:29,541 --> 02:41:37,397
LAURA: So there's this guy. He's a shithead. Okay,
there's this guy.

1794
02:41:37,397 --> 02:41:39,393
MATT: "Right, okay."

1795
02:41:39,393 --> 02:41:42,185
LAURA: He wanted to be a god, but he wasn't a
god.

1796
02:41:42,185 --> 02:41:45,395
MARISHA: Three mimosas later, and three hours
later...

1797
02:41:45,395 --> 02:41:48,105
LAURA: We explain the story of Vecna and tell him
he's back.

1798
02:41:48,105 --> 02:41:53,356
MARISHA: (slurring) And he totally didn't call us
back! And I told him

1799
02:41:53,356 --> 02:41:55,086
I'm not getting back together again.

1800
02:41:55,086 --> 02:41:57,142
MATT: "Sounds like a really, really bad man."

1801
02:41:57,142 --> 02:41:58,391
LAURA: He's here.

1802
02:41:58,391 --> 02:41:59,623
MATT: "He's here?"

1803
02:41:59,623 --> 02:42:05,743
LAURA: He's here on this plane, and he's trying to
become a god, and who knows, maybe he succeeded.

1804
02:42:05,743 --> 02:42:10,542
How long were we in the Feywild? Do we even know
that for sure?

1805
02:42:10,542 --> 02:42:15,324
MARISHA: Did I figure that out with my check, or
no?

1806
02:42:15,324 --> 02:42:16,552
LAURA: What's the date?

1807
02:42:16,552 --> 02:42:18,331
MARISHA: Yeah, how much time has it been?

1808
02:42:18,331 --> 02:42:20,977
MATT: The date would be--

1809
02:42:20,977 --> 02:42:22,690
SAM: Is there a calendar system?

1810
02:42:22,690 --> 02:42:23,925
MATT: Yes, there is.

1811
02:42:23,925 --> 02:42:25,753
LAURA: But we don't know it.

1812
02:42:25,753 --> 02:42:29,442
TALIESIN: So he's going to tell us a date that
will mean nothing to us because we don't actually

1813
02:42:29,442 --> 02:42:31,889
know the date we left because we don't know how
dates work.

1814
02:42:31,889 --> 02:42:35,209
LIAM: I think it's Bidetsday. Yeah, Bidetsday.

1815
02:42:35,209 --> 02:42:36,934
TALIESIN: Bidusday, Bidetsday.

1816
02:42:36,934 --> 02:42:40,952
LIAM: Let's see. Bidetsday.

1817
02:42:40,952 --> 02:42:47,274
TALIESIN: Bidusday, Biwhatsday. Biheyhay.

1818
02:42:47,274 --> 02:42:50,806
MATT: Hold on, I'm having to look it up because
you did this to me.

1819
02:42:50,806 --> 02:42:56,187
TALIESIN: This is like watching the DND icon
crash.

1820
02:42:56,187 --> 02:42:58,653
MARISHA: It's frozen!

1821
02:42:58,653 --> 02:43:10,625
MATT: "It is the 12th day of Misothar of 812 PD?"

1822
02:43:10,625 --> 02:43:14,322
LAURA: Oh, of course it is! Does that sound normal
to us?

1823
02:43:14,322 --> 02:43:18,386
MATT: It sounds like the exact same day that you
left, actually.

1824
02:43:18,386 --> 02:43:22,442
TALIESIN: Well, that's convenient.

1825
02:43:22,442 --> 02:43:29,088
MARISHA: It's the same day we left? Oh, cool! We
lucked out! Yay!

1826
02:43:29,088 --> 02:43:36,150
MATT: You did luck out! I was like, oh man!
There's a chance they could show up and have

1827
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:43,295
missed the whole thing. I would have had to change
a lot, but that would have been fun. That would

1828
02:43:43,295 --> 02:43:44,667
have been fun.

1829
02:43:44,667 --> 02:43:45,826
LAURA: For one roll.

1830
02:43:45,826 --> 02:43:48,870
MATT: From one roll, yeah. Hey, Feywild's a
dangerous thing when timetables--

1831
02:43:48,870 --> 02:43:51,063
LIAM: Hey, buddy, you missed your window!

1832
02:43:51,063 --> 02:44:02,021
ASHLEY: So basically, we're going to need a lot of
help, and please stay in prayer.

1833
02:44:02,021 --> 02:44:06,781
LAURA: Get ready to fight, Vincent. Get ready to
fucking fight.

1834
02:44:06,781 --> 02:44:10,997
MATT: You look at Sheila and Vincent, who look
like anyone's in-laws, and go,

1835
02:44:10,997 --> 02:44:18,212
"Very well, Mistress, right?" 
"Yes, we'll do our best."

1836
02:44:18,212 --> 02:44:21,517
LAURA: PS, do you know anything about the fields
of Elysium?

1837
02:44:21,517 --> 02:44:26,548
TALIESIN: Did you just say PS to someone? Did you
say that out loud?

1838
02:44:26,548 --> 02:44:35,416
MATT: "Yes, they are a home to souls who champion
the cause of good outside the forces of law and

1839
02:44:35,416 --> 02:44:46,337
"chaos. It's a beautiful place, from what the tales
say. Many who go never leave. It's so beautiful."

1840
02:44:46,337 --> 02:44:51,551
LAURA: What gods live there?

1841
02:44:51,551 --> 02:45:06,448
MATT: "As far as I know, only the Dawnfather
himself." The Dawnfather is Pelor.

1842
02:45:06,448 --> 02:45:13,081
"That's all I know. My research is limited."

1843
02:45:13,081 --> 02:45:15,407
LAURA: Right. Should you tell him?

1844
02:45:15,407 --> 02:45:23,419
ASHLEY: I don't feel like I want to.

1845
02:45:23,419 --> 02:45:28,089
TALIESIN: Let's gather the boys and alert whatever
government we can.

1846
02:45:28,089 --> 02:45:31,514
LAURA: You guys, thank you for your help today.

1847
02:45:31,514 --> 02:45:33,697
ASHELY: It was wonderful to see you guys again.

1848
02:45:33,697 --> 02:45:40,029
MATT: "Of course, my pleasure, Mistress Pike. Good
luck. Hopefully, you'll stop this thing."

1849
02:45:40,029 --> 02:45:43,101
ASHLEY: Hopefully we will. Please pray for us.

1850
02:45:43,101 --> 02:45:52,796
MARISHA: Amazing work. If you need any landscaping done, don't
be afraid to ask.

1851
02:45:52,796 --> 02:45:54,093
Pike can get you in touch with me.

1852
02:45:54,093 --> 02:45:56,554
LAURA: Melora is really good at it, too. We should
talk to Melora.

1853
02:45:56,554 --> 02:45:58,769
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine. We know people.

1854
02:45:58,769 --> 02:46:06,304
ASHLEY: Thank you. Keep up the good work. You're
doing, just, all the great stuff.

1855
02:46:06,304 --> 02:46:07,949
MATT: "Thank you!"

1856
02:46:07,949 --> 02:46:11,821
LAURA: I like the idea that anywhere we go, we
embarrass the one person that knows anybody else.

1857
02:46:11,821 --> 02:46:24,029
MATT: Yep. You're <i>those</i> friends. They smile and
walk away, but Vincent Clor definitely seems a bit

1858
02:46:24,029 --> 02:46:31,534
shaken by the knowledge that you just brought to
him. But you make your way out of the temple.

1859
02:46:31,534 --> 02:46:33,592
Where are you off to? What's your next direction?

1860
02:46:33,592 --> 02:46:39,326
LIAM: I will note that Vax feels a slight sense
of bittersweet pride at the amount of bliss that

1861
02:46:39,326 --> 02:46:41,579
Pike just went through. Just a little bit.

1862
02:46:41,579 --> 02:46:46,336
MATT: You two. Where you going?

1863
02:46:46,336 --> 02:46:55,169
TRAVIS: All right, so I know this guy named the
Lord of the Quad Roads. Back up. While you were

1864
02:46:55,169 --> 02:46:59,394
gone-- were you gone? I'm not sure. Did you know
that I have this little magical thing?

1865
02:46:59,394 --> 02:47:01,172
SAM: No?

1866
02:47:01,172 --> 02:47:02,351
TRAVIS: No. Okay.

1867
02:47:02,351 --> 02:47:05,454
(laughter)

1868
02:47:05,454 --> 02:47:11,151
TRAVIS: So because you kept my secret about Craven
Edge, and you never told anybody about that,

1869
02:47:11,151 --> 02:47:18,027
right? Not one time. Never told anyone. I'm going
to confide in you about this thing. I found this

1870
02:47:18,027 --> 02:47:25,653
little deck of cards, and I was like, oh, I'm
going to pull a card out! And I did, and I got a

1871
02:47:25,653 --> 02:47:32,094
magic weapon! I could throw it and it would start
fighting and stuff. But that turned to rust. And

1872
02:47:32,094 --> 02:47:39,468
so I was like, I wanted to pull more out. But Vex
was like, no, it's so dangerous!

1873
02:47:39,468 --> 02:47:41,839
SAM: That's a good impression. She can be that
way.

1874
02:47:41,839 --> 02:47:49,387
TRAVIS: So I went to Vasselheim. Actually, I was
looking for you, you little shitstack. And I was

1875
02:47:49,387 --> 02:47:54,960
like, hey, I've got an idea! (explosion) Boom! In
my head!

1876
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:58,636
SAM: I got it the first time.

1877
02:47:58,636 --> 02:48:02,292
(laughter)

1878
02:48:02,292 --> 02:48:04,757
TALIESIN: This is the best retelling of this
ever.

1879
02:48:04,757 --> 02:48:09,175
TRAVIS: I was like, I'm going to find a guy to
pull out cards for me, see what happens!

1880
02:48:09,175 --> 02:48:13,499
SAM: Because you were afraid or because she said
you can't?

1881
02:48:13,499 --> 02:48:16,718
TRAVIS: Well, I heard her nagging me in my head.

1882
02:48:16,718 --> 02:48:18,919
SAM: Conscience.

1883
02:48:18,919 --> 02:48:21,702
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1884
02:48:21,702 --> 02:48:24,209
(laughter)

1885
02:48:24,209 --> 02:48:28,503
TRAVIS: Sure. So I got this drunk guy on the
street and I was like, hey, pull out a card. And

1886
02:48:28,503 --> 02:48:32,185
guess what? He pulled a card, and he got wishes!

1887
02:48:32,185 --> 02:48:35,168
SAM: Did you get wishes?

1888
02:48:35,168 --> 02:48:44,047
TRAVIS: No! Because fucking I made him pick it. So
he goes, ooh! And all of a sudden, he was in fancy

1889
02:48:44,047 --> 02:48:46,176
clothes and he had a servant that appeared in the
alley!

1890
02:48:46,176 --> 02:48:47,473
SAM: Did he thank you?

1891
02:48:47,473 --> 02:48:52,797
TRAVIS: He was like, thanks! I guess I have two
more of these! And he fucking ran off!

1892
02:48:52,797 --> 02:48:54,800
SAM: Wait! He took your cards and he left?

1893
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:59,760
TRAVIS: No, he pulled the one card and it
disappeared in his hand. Right? And then he walked

1894
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:02,541
off. But the point is: he's got two more wishes!

1895
02:49:02,541 --> 02:49:04,250
SAM: On him.

1896
02:49:04,250 --> 02:49:11,006
TRAVIS: Yeah! And I told him, Grog! Grog gave you
those! Remember me!

1897
02:49:11,006 --> 02:49:17,791
SAM: Just so I'm clear. We're going to go, grab
him, steal his wishes, leave him in a ditch

1898
02:49:17,791 --> 02:49:21,502
somewhere. Is that the plan? What's our game
here?

1899
02:49:21,502 --> 02:49:23,234
TRAVIS: I'm not opposed to it.

1900
02:49:23,234 --> 02:49:25,113
SAM: What's our game? What are we trying to get?

1901
02:49:25,113 --> 02:49:32,155
TRAVIS: I thought, maybe, if we walked in and I
had a title like Grog the Wish Giver, and we were

1902
02:49:32,155 --> 02:49:40,655
calling to check in on him, that maybe it's time
to pay his tithe to the Wish Giver, and maybe he

1903
02:49:40,655 --> 02:49:42,445
would give us one of the two.

1904
02:49:42,445 --> 02:49:52,064
SAM: Okay, so our game is to intimidate him into
having him give you one of the wishes back.

1905
02:49:52,064 --> 02:49:58,487
TRAVIS: Yeah! Or pressure him. Lay it on thick. We
could say like, "Your fucking face is going to

1906
02:49:58,487 --> 02:50:01,082
"fall off if you don't give me one of your
remaining wishes."

1907
02:50:01,082 --> 02:50:03,502
SAM: What happened to the deck of cards?

1908
02:50:03,502 --> 02:50:05,060
TRAVIS: Oh, I've still got them.

1909
02:50:05,060 --> 02:50:08,109
SAM: Why are we going back to get-- oh! He has
more <i>wishes</i>!

1910
02:50:08,109 --> 02:50:11,151
Not more cards, he has more wishes!

1911
02:50:11,151 --> 02:50:12,408
TRAVIS: Yes!

1912
02:50:12,408 --> 02:50:16,015
SAM: And he should give one to us. What would you
wish for?

1913
02:50:16,015 --> 02:50:24,212
TRAVIS: Well. (haltingly) For peace on Exandria,
right?

1914
02:50:24,212 --> 02:50:27,504
SAM: You don't seem enthusiastic about that wish.

1915
02:50:27,504 --> 02:50:34,282
TRAVIS: I want to live forever! Just never die! I
just want to him to go,

1916
02:50:34,282 --> 02:50:37,304
you will never die. I'm happy.

1917
02:50:37,304 --> 02:50:44,154
SAM: That's a better wish for you, for sure. And
we have two of them.

1918
02:50:44,154 --> 02:50:48,382
TRAVIS: Aren't you really old, though? You get
company.

1919
02:50:48,382 --> 02:50:51,439
SAM: That's true. It'd be nice having you around
for a bit.

1920
02:50:51,439 --> 02:50:53,269
TRAVIS: What would you wish for?

1921
02:50:53,269 --> 02:50:55,102
SAM: Peace on--

1922
02:50:55,102 --> 02:50:57,018
TRAVIS: I mean, enough of the bullshit.

1923
02:50:57,018 --> 02:51:03,359
SAM: Yeah, well, probably. Do you just get one
wish?

1924
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:05,566
Because I could be a littler taller, a 
little buffer.

1925
02:51:05,566 --> 02:51:08,470
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think maybe you can get real
descriptive with it, too,

1926
02:51:08,470 --> 02:51:10,284
so you can make it real complicated.

1927
02:51:10,284 --> 02:51:15,554
SAM: What would I wish for?

1928
02:51:15,554 --> 02:51:22,124
TRAVIS: Maybe think about it while we're on our
way. Yeah! How about we go and we pressure him and

1929
02:51:22,124 --> 02:51:26,001
then if he doesn't bite, then we kill him.

1930
02:51:26,001 --> 02:51:31,783
SAM: Take this hat, it's the Hat of Disguise. Put
it on, and you can look however you want to look.

1931
02:51:31,783 --> 02:51:33,722
TRAVIS: I want to look like me. He's going to
remember me.

1932
02:51:33,722 --> 02:51:35,270
SAM: Well, then never mind that.

1933
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:37,771
TRAVIS: You're the idea man.

1934
02:51:37,771 --> 02:51:40,212
SAM: I'm sorry! You're throwing a lot at me!

1935
02:51:40,212 --> 02:51:46,180
TRAVIS: Warm it up, son. Let's get the bad ones
out of the way right now. Shake it off.

1936
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:50,452
SAM: All right. What do we need to intimidate him?
Do you need me to be your enforcer?

1937
02:51:50,452 --> 02:51:59,239
TRAVIS: Yeah! Or maybe my manservant. Can you make
me look really amazing?

1938
02:51:59,239 --> 02:52:02,213
SAM: You already look amazing.

1939
02:52:02,213 --> 02:52:04,682
TRAVIS: But rich and Wish Giver-y.

1940
02:52:04,682 --> 02:52:07,288
SAM: Yeah. Take this hat and put it on.

1941
02:52:07,288 --> 02:52:21,263
(laughter)

1942
02:52:21,263 --> 02:52:23,682
SAM: And now you can look however you think you
should look!

1943
02:52:23,682 --> 02:52:34,818
(laughter)

1944
02:52:34,818 --> 02:52:37,430
LIAM: Everybody at the table is broken!

1945
02:52:37,430 --> 02:52:41,372
(laughter)

1946
02:52:41,372 --> 02:52:44,377
TRAVIS: I want to look like a sultan.

1947
02:52:44,377 --> 02:52:51,979
MATT: It doesn't do anything. You have to attune
to it. At this point in time, by the way, you

1948
02:52:51,979 --> 02:52:55,724
watch as four armed guards start approaching.

1949
02:52:55,724 --> 02:52:57,937
TRAVIS: I have a great record with these guys.

1950
02:52:57,937 --> 02:53:01,024
LAURA: Oh no! <i>Oh no!</i>

1951
02:53:01,024 --> 02:53:02,952
SAM: Are they approaching us?

1952
02:53:02,952 --> 02:53:06,735
MATT: They're approaching you, and two on the
sides are spreading out, and two are walking up

1953
02:53:06,735 --> 02:53:08,617
with purpose towards you guys.

1954
02:53:08,617 --> 02:53:14,166
SAM: The popo. We haven't done anything wrong,
we're just talking on the street! We're just two

1955
02:53:14,166 --> 02:53:17,009
guys! Yeah! We haven't done any magic!

1956
02:53:17,009 --> 02:53:21,773
MATT: As the two come to the flank and stop, hands
on the sides of their spears, the two that walked

1957
02:53:21,773 --> 02:53:25,161
up the middle, there's one that looks to be a
captain of some kind and this one to his right

1958
02:53:25,161 --> 02:53:32,582
who's dressed in standard guard gear looks like
he's got a few long-healed scars and he goes,

1959
02:53:32,582 --> 02:53:35,693
"That looks just like him."

1960
02:53:35,693 --> 02:53:40,436
SAM: Oh no. What did you do?

1961
02:53:40,436 --> 02:53:42,038
LAURA: What did <i>you</i> do?

1962
02:53:42,038 --> 02:53:43,713
MARISHA: You were with him as Tary!

1963
02:53:43,713 --> 02:53:45,095
SAM: I wasn't there!

1964
02:53:45,095 --> 02:53:48,811
(laughter)

1965
02:53:48,811 --> 02:53:58,567
MATT: The one in adorned armor. "Sir, might I have
your name and purpose here in Vasselheim?"

1966
02:53:58,567 --> 02:54:09,012
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Peter Frostbucket! I seek
Lord of the Quad Roads!

1967
02:54:09,012 --> 02:54:16,557
MATT: (giggling) Make a deception check with
disadvantage.

1968
02:54:16,557 --> 02:54:21,372
TRAVIS: I don't need it! Negative one!

1969
02:54:21,372 --> 02:54:27,077
(laughter)

1970
02:54:27,077 --> 02:54:31,774
SAM: Oh my god. We're going to have to kill some
guards, aren't we?

1971
02:54:31,774 --> 02:54:34,691
(laughter)

1972
02:54:34,691 --> 02:54:36,550
TRAVIS: Two and a one.

1973
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:45,624
MARISHA: They did that, not us!

1974
02:54:45,624 --> 02:54:50,987
LIAM: Sarenrae comes down and says, never mind!

1975
02:54:50,987 --> 02:54:54,529
TALIESIN: Your picture is going to be up in a
small office by the gates.

1976
02:54:54,529 --> 02:55:04,358
MATT: The captain-looking individual goes, "Right,
Mr. Frostbucket. We would like the both of you to

1977
02:55:04,358 --> 02:55:09,611
"please come with us." The two guards rush into
your flank a bit and place their hands on your

1978
02:55:09,611 --> 02:55:11,111
shoulder and your shoulder.

1979
02:55:11,111 --> 02:55:16,037
SAM: Me? I just met this man. I've never seen him
before in my life.

1980
02:55:16,037 --> 02:55:19,281
MATT: "You've been walking with him for 20
minutes."

1981
02:55:19,281 --> 02:55:28,980
SAM: Thank you for coming over here. He was
holding me hostage. He wouldn't let me leave. I'm

1982
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:33,018
a small man. I'm defenseless, and he was holding
me captive.

1983
02:55:33,018 --> 02:55:35,561
MATT: You make a deception check.

1984
02:55:35,561 --> 02:55:46,958
SAM: Deception. Okay, 24.

1985
02:55:46,958 --> 02:55:50,094
LAURA: Ooh, what is that eyebrow?

1986
02:55:50,094 --> 02:56:02,228
MATT: It's a natural 20! He goes, "Really. And
what's your name?"

1987
02:56:02,228 --> 02:56:04,196
SAM: Gerald Butler.

1988
02:56:04,368 --> 02:56:11,595
(laughter)

1989
02:56:11,595 --> 02:56:20,655
MATT: "Uh-huh. Well, Gerald Butler, the two of you
should come with us." He turns around and starts

1990
02:56:20,655 --> 02:56:26,601
walking away. The other guard with him, the one
who spotted you earlier, walks with him, but keeps

1991
02:56:26,601 --> 02:56:31,480
looking over his shoulder at you. He looks
genuinely terrified of you. At this point, you

1992
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:37,233
realize, oh yeah, you've seen this guy before. The
two other guards shove you forward, and as they

1993
02:56:37,233 --> 02:56:41,034
push you a couple of steps in that direction, they
lower their spears towards your back,

1994
02:56:41,034 --> 02:56:42,589
"Keep moving!"

1995
02:56:42,589 --> 02:56:46,586
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, sorry. Aside from the four
around us, is anyone around?

1996
02:56:46,586 --> 02:56:51,997
MATT: Yeah, there's probably roughly 20 to 25
different townsfolk.

1997
02:56:51,997 --> 02:56:58,360
SAM: We just were walking down the street! What
happened?

1998
02:56:58,360 --> 02:56:59,990
TRAVIS: This is profiling.

1999
02:56:59,990 --> 02:57:01,656
SAM: This is racial profiling.

2000
02:57:01,656 --> 02:57:08,995
MATT: You carve a figure.

2001
02:57:08,995 --> 02:57:11,097
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2002
02:57:11,097 --> 02:57:18,471
SAM: You or me? All right.

2003
02:57:18,471 --> 02:57:22,179
TRAVIS: I mean, mine's do one thing. You've got
options.

2004
02:57:22,179 --> 02:57:30,051
SAM: All right. I will, I guess-- Jesus. It all
seems so stupid.

2005
02:57:30,051 --> 02:57:35,023
TRAVIS: I just want to go talk to the Lord of the
Crossroads!

2006
02:57:35,023 --> 02:57:38,345
TALIESIN: Critical Role: It all seems so stupid.

2007
02:57:38,345 --> 02:57:42,729
MATT: Yep! That's our catchphrase now.

2008
02:57:42,729 --> 02:57:49,829
SAM: All right, I will use some gigantic spell for
no reason.

2009
02:57:49,829 --> 02:57:58,723
MARISHA: Fighting gods one day, getting arrested
in the street the other day.

2010
02:57:58,723 --> 02:58:01,951
SAM: I can help me fine, it's you I need to deal
with.

2011
02:58:01,951 --> 02:58:03,719
TRAVIS: Manipulate that guy that recognized us.

2012
02:58:03,719 --> 02:58:08,686
SAM: Sure, but I don't know what he knows! I don't
know anything! All I know is he came over and

2013
02:58:08,686 --> 02:58:10,082
fingered you.

2014
02:58:10,082 --> 02:58:12,565
TRAVIS: He said, it looks like it's him.

2015
02:58:12,565 --> 02:58:29,483
SAM: All right. I will-- Jesus. Okay. Fuck! I
don't know what to do without causing everyone

2016
02:58:29,483 --> 02:58:36,769
around us to die or be scared! All right! Is there
a leader?

2017
02:58:36,769 --> 02:58:45,031
MATT: Yeah, there's the captain. The one that
looks scared looks over and says,

2018
02:58:45,031 --> 02:58:51,128
"Is your other friend around? The other big one?"

2019
02:58:51,128 --> 02:58:56,210
TRAVIS: Kind of blanched complexion, orange hair?

2020
02:58:56,210 --> 02:58:57,567
MATT: "Yeah with the--"

2021
02:58:57,567 --> 02:58:59,273
TRAVIS: Hits people in the face?

2022
02:58:59,273 --> 02:59:01,022
MATT: "That one."

2023
02:59:01,022 --> 02:59:08,511
TRAVIS: Somewhere around here.

2024
02:59:08,511 --> 02:59:13,115
MATT: Turns to the guard captain and goes,
"There's another one around here. Possibly two."

2025
02:59:13,115 --> 02:59:20,522
TRAVIS: You know, the thing about that one,
though, he doesn't like to leave loose ends.

2026
02:59:20,522 --> 02:59:25,139
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2027
02:59:25,139 --> 02:59:28,428
TRAVIS: Goddamn it! 13!

2028
02:59:28,428 --> 02:59:29,782
LAURA: Stop rolling that one!

2029
02:59:29,782 --> 02:59:31,238
TRAVIS: No. I stay with my dice.

2030
02:59:31,238 --> 02:59:33,163
SAM: What did this other one look like?

2031
02:59:33,163 --> 02:59:35,203
TRAVIS: This other one?

2032
02:59:35,203 --> 02:59:37,220
SAM: Yes, the other one, what did he look like?

2033
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:40,223
TRAVIS: Very tall and metallic-looking.

2034
02:59:40,223 --> 02:59:41,630
SAM: Metallic-looking?

2035
02:59:41,630 --> 02:59:42,673
TRAVIS: Yep.

2036
02:59:42,673 --> 02:59:46,767
SAM: You mean, the one we just saw around the
corner?

2037
02:59:46,767 --> 02:59:53,234
TRAVIS: We did! I was not really aware at the
time.

2038
02:59:53,234 --> 02:59:54,834
SAM: The super scary one?

2039
02:59:54,834 --> 02:59:58,303
TRAVIS: Yeah! Well, now that you mention it, I
felt a chill!

2040
02:59:58,303 --> 03:00:08,729
SAM: Please believe us. There is an even bigger
danger coming, and I think-- oh yes, it's right

2041
03:00:08,729 --> 03:00:20,474
there. And I will Major Image what I think he's
describing, which is a tall Iron Man.

2042
03:00:20,474 --> 03:00:28,889
MATT: All right. (laughs) First, make a deception
check to see if they look.

2043
03:00:28,889 --> 03:00:33,783
SAM: 20-- lots. 27.

2044
03:00:33,783 --> 03:00:40,241
MATT: You urging them on is just enough to get
them to glance over and look, which gives you

2045
03:00:40,347 --> 03:00:46,968
enough time to cast the spell and release this
image, and from around the corner, with heavy

2046
03:00:46,968 --> 03:00:54,562
footfalls, you watch as what appears to be some
horrific-looking iron golem-type entity that's

2047
03:00:54,562 --> 03:01:03,847
covered in spikes and darkness and giant fists.
(heavy impacts) People start screaming and

2048
03:01:03,847 --> 03:01:06,830
scattering, and the guards are all of a sudden.
(gasping)

2049
03:01:06,830 --> 03:01:09,677
TRAVIS: Oh no, his final change is complete!

2050
03:01:09,677 --> 03:01:12,161
SAM: Oh, he didn't look like this before?

2051
03:01:12,161 --> 03:01:13,558
TRAVIS: No, it's much worse!

2052
03:01:13,558 --> 03:01:15,627
SAM: It's much worse? Yes, it's much worse!

2053
03:01:15,627 --> 03:01:21,353
MATT: At which point, suddenly you watch as its
size expands even further. It has metal tusks that

2054
03:01:21,353 --> 03:01:25,972
now protrude from the front of its face, and it's
breathing steam and smoke, its eyes red and

2055
03:01:25,972 --> 03:01:28,716
glowing. (huffing)

2056
03:01:28,716 --> 03:01:34,160
TRAVIS: I trip and fall. Please, save yourselves!
Run!

2057
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:39,545
MATT: The guard captain there, immediately seeing
this, reaches back and pulls a horn off his belt.

2058
03:01:39,545 --> 03:01:41,746
(horn blows)

2059
03:01:41,746 --> 03:01:46,547
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill him.

2060
03:01:46,547 --> 03:01:49,104
SAM: Don't kill him. We'll all die!

2061
03:01:49,104 --> 03:01:50,890
TRAVIS: I reach up and snap the horn.

2062
03:01:50,890 --> 03:01:53,962
MATT: (horn blows, cracking)

2063
03:01:53,962 --> 03:02:00,042
SAM: Horns make him angrier! And I'll make the
image go crazy with rage.

2064
03:02:00,042 --> 03:02:05,188
MATT: Angrily starts stomping around, not
affecting anything directly.

2065
03:02:05,188 --> 03:02:11,513
SAM: The only way to calm it down is if we slowly
walk away in different directions.

2066
03:02:11,513 --> 03:02:17,078
(laughter)

2067
03:02:17,078 --> 03:02:20,144
MATT: Make a deception check with disadvantage.

2068
03:02:20,144 --> 03:02:25,204
SAM: Okay. 24.

2069
03:02:25,204 --> 03:02:33,344
TALIESIN: (laughs) It's a 20.

2070
03:02:33,344 --> 03:02:35,879
SAM: It's a 20.

2071
03:02:35,879 --> 03:02:37,461
LAURA: I bet it's a 20.

2072
03:02:37,461 --> 03:02:38,917
TRAVIS: It's a 20.

2073
03:02:38,917 --> 03:02:41,630
(laughter)

2074
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:45,889
TALIESIN: Oh god, this is everything I ever
wanted!

2075
03:02:45,889 --> 03:02:54,586
MATT: He glances back at you, reaches back, and
starts pulling a set of manacles from the side of

2076
03:02:54,586 --> 03:03:05,706
his belt and glances over at this image, and you
see the face of recognition, of somebody who now

2077
03:03:05,706 --> 03:03:10,726
knows exactly what you were up to. This guy is not
your petty wandering guard in the center of the

2078
03:03:10,726 --> 03:03:15,921
street, and while two other guards have rushed up to
try to push townsfolk out of the way, and they

2079
03:03:15,921 --> 03:03:24,715
have their spears drawn at this thrashing entity,
the captain goes, "Stop, it's not real." You now

2080
03:03:24,715 --> 03:03:27,579
see a bunch of other guards that are now, after
hearing the horn call,

2081
03:03:27,579 --> 03:03:29,290
rushing around the sides of the street.

2082
03:03:29,290 --> 03:03:36,443
TRAVIS: Well, you got us. Yep.

2083
03:03:36,443 --> 03:03:38,942
SAM: Should we turn ourselves in?

2084
03:03:38,942 --> 03:03:43,051
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sure, yeah. Lock me up first.

2085
03:03:43,051 --> 03:03:47,968
MATT: He comes over.

2086
03:03:47,968 --> 03:03:49,082
TRAVIS: (whack)

2087
03:03:49,082 --> 03:03:50,446
(laughter)

2088
03:03:50,446 --> 03:03:53,738
LAURA: No!

2089
03:03:53,738 --> 03:03:57,162
MATT: Roll an attack.

2090
03:03:57,162 --> 03:04:03,013
LAURA: You're starting a war with all of the
guards in Vasselheim?

2091
03:04:03,013 --> 03:04:05,230
TRAVIS: I don't think that far ahead.

2092
03:04:05,230 --> 03:04:09,743
SAM: They started this war. We're finishing it.

2093
03:04:09,743 --> 03:04:11,626
TRAVIS: 26.

2094
03:04:11,626 --> 03:04:16,502
MATT: Okay. Roll 1d4 damage with the Titanstone
Gauntlets and add your strength modifier.

2095
03:04:16,502 --> 03:04:18,526
LAURA: What are we going to do?

2096
03:04:18,526 --> 03:04:20,987
TALIESIN: Let's hire new guards.

2097
03:04:20,987 --> 03:04:22,876
TRAVIS: Ten.

2098
03:04:22,876 --> 03:04:28,446
MATT: Okay. The helmet he was wearing, which is
carved around the face and eyes and nose, as you

2099
03:04:28,446 --> 03:04:33,691
slam it with your fist, it caves in a bit, and he
immediately hits the ground and is dazed.

2100
03:04:33,691 --> 03:04:35,487
TRAVIS: Got to go.

2101
03:04:35,487 --> 03:04:40,547
MATT: The other guards, who were looking at him
when he shouted that, saw you deck him in the side

2102
03:04:40,547 --> 03:04:45,951
of the head, and they immediately start rushing to
his aid as the other guards are coming in on the

2103
03:04:45,951 --> 03:04:47,542
side of the street. What are you guys doing?

2104
03:04:47,542 --> 03:04:49,138
SAM: Are there any buildings around here?

2105
03:04:49,138 --> 03:04:54,531
MATT: There are plenty of buildings around here.
You guys are still walking through the Quad Roads,

2106
03:04:54,531 --> 03:05:02,241
and the Quad Roads is the most populated portion
of the city. The worship here of Erathis is

2107
03:05:02,241 --> 03:05:06,809
generally about civilization. There's a lot of
people and a lot of buildings around. What are you

2108
03:05:06,809 --> 03:05:08,087
going to do?

2109
03:05:08,087 --> 03:05:19,219
SAM: (sighs) You're bigger. All right, I will do
the old classic. I'm going to Polymorph Grog into

2110
03:05:19,219 --> 03:05:27,230
a giant eagle. The old standby. The giant eagle
trick, if you'll accept it.

2111
03:05:27,230 --> 03:05:28,596
TRAVIS: I'll get smarter. Sure.

2112
03:05:28,596 --> 03:05:36,716
MATT: All right. Grog, once again, you feel the
wings extend. You're free to fly, and huh! That's

2113
03:05:36,716 --> 03:05:45,619
how numbers work. You leap onto his back as the
guards are coming up, and you (wing beats) take

2114
03:05:45,619 --> 03:05:53,118
up. As you guys begin to fly up, the illusion
vanishes immediately, and all of the guards that

2115
03:05:53,118 --> 03:05:57,213
are rushing up stop, see this happening, and start
switching over to their various crossbows and

2116
03:05:57,213 --> 03:05:58,436
ranged implements.

2117
03:05:58,436 --> 03:06:02,322
SAM: Sure. Yeah. I've got nothing.

2118
03:06:02,322 --> 03:06:16,398
MATT: Literally, that escalated quickly. All
right, so a bunch of shots trying to be taken at

2119
03:06:16,398 --> 03:06:24,766
both of you. I'm going to say six to each from the
crossbows. What's the giant eagle's AC, Marisha?

2120
03:06:24,766 --> 03:06:27,717
TALIESIN: Oh gosh, you are keeper of the giant
eagle AC.

2121
03:06:27,717 --> 03:06:30,536
LAURA: Is the giant eagle small enough to
Dimension Door?

2122
03:06:30,536 --> 03:06:31,787
SAM: Nope.

2123
03:06:31,787 --> 03:06:37,713
MATT: I rolled a perception check for that one
guard, and he rolled really high and saw you

2124
03:06:37,713 --> 03:06:41,547
walking down the street and was like, "Oh fuck."
And went and got the captain.

2125
03:06:41,547 --> 03:06:43,104
TRAVIS: I should have killed him back at the
shop.

2126
03:06:43,104 --> 03:06:47,663
TALIESIN: Is that the takeaway from this? You
should have killed the guard? I'm just checking.

2127
03:06:47,663 --> 03:06:49,834
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure this problem wouldn't have
existed.

2128
03:06:49,834 --> 03:06:58,449
MATT: All right, so two shots hit the eagle for
seven and six. 13 points of piercing damage.

2129
03:06:58,449 --> 03:07:06,866
MARISHA: You are at 27.

2130
03:07:06,866 --> 03:07:08,404
TALIESIN: Oh wait, is that the--

2131
03:07:08,404 --> 03:07:13,631
MARISHA: Wait. Nope, I lied. How many points?

2132
03:07:13,631 --> 03:07:14,897
LIAM: 13.

2133
03:07:14,897 --> 03:07:17,464
MARISHA: You're at half. You're at 13 hit points.

2134
03:07:17,464 --> 03:07:19,009
TRAVIS: I have 13 left?

2135
03:07:19,009 --> 03:07:22,908
LAURA: It's going to break your concentration.

2136
03:07:22,908 --> 03:07:30,742
TALIESIN: This is the most hilarious thing I've
ever seen.

2137
03:07:30,742 --> 03:07:32,252
LIAM: Next week, a prison break.

2138
03:07:32,252 --> 03:07:39,149
MARISHA: Normally, I'm the one who's arrested.
Mixing it up.

2139
03:07:39,149 --> 03:07:45,829
MATT: 23 points of piercing damage. I need you to
go ahead and make

2140
03:07:45,829 --> 03:07:49,747
four concentration checks, with advantage.

2141
03:07:49,747 --> 03:07:53,404
SAM: What do I add? Nothing, right?

2142
03:07:53,404 --> 03:07:54,911
MATT: It's your constitution saving throw.

2143
03:07:54,911 --> 03:07:57,549
SAM: Saving throw. Okay. 19.

2144
03:07:57,549 --> 03:07:58,716
MATT: You're okay.

2145
03:07:58,716 --> 03:08:15,195
SAM: More for that one. 17. More.

2146
03:08:15,195 --> 03:08:19,577
MATT: Okay, you're fine. You maintain
concentration. The eagle form flies up. You guys

2147
03:08:19,577 --> 03:08:26,009
are now beginning to rise up over the city, and
you're getting further out of the range of any

2148
03:08:26,009 --> 03:08:30,093
sort of ranged weaponry to be immediately
effective, but you don't know how long before

2149
03:08:30,093 --> 03:08:34,300
other, bigger guns are brought into the fray. What
are you going to do? You look down over the whole

2150
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:41,464
Quad Roads and you can now see, the whole city of
Vasselheim almost looks like a top-heavy X with

2151
03:08:41,464 --> 03:08:46,363
the mountain range at the top. The Quad Roads is
where that X meets at the base.

2152
03:08:46,363 --> 03:08:48,397
What are you doing?

2153
03:08:48,397 --> 03:08:54,365
SAM: Oh, you can't talk. Shit. Land us in an alley
somewhere, and

2154
03:08:54,365 --> 03:08:57,310
we'll change our appearance, I suppose.

2155
03:08:57,310 --> 03:08:58,712
TRAVIS: (squawks)

2156
03:08:58,712 --> 03:09:09,400
MATT: Make an investigation check. What's the
eagle's intelligence modifier? This would be

2157
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:10,811
perception, actually.

2158
03:09:10,811 --> 03:09:20,018
MARISHA: Is this wisdom? Well, they have keen
sight, so they have advantage on wisdom checks,

2159
03:09:20,018 --> 03:09:23,785
and the wisdom is plus two. Although, don't you
maintain--

2160
03:09:23,785 --> 03:09:27,748
MATT: No, you do in wild shape. Polymorph, you do
not.

2161
03:09:27,748 --> 03:09:29,965
MARISHA: So plus two, and you have advantage.

2162
03:09:29,965 --> 03:09:31,601
MATT: What's the bonus to perception?

2163
03:09:31,601 --> 03:09:36,412
MARISHA: They just have advantage on perception
checks.

2164
03:09:36,412 --> 03:09:37,732
TRAVIS: 16.

2165
03:09:37,732 --> 03:09:42,313
MATT: 16. Easy enough, you glance around with your
eagle eyes, and you see what appears to be a

2166
03:09:42,313 --> 03:09:48,626
darkened alleyway that is in a cluster of
heavily residential buildings. You dive down. You

2167
03:09:48,626 --> 03:09:53,547
hold on, (screams) going down into this free fall,
the wind rushing past you. You have to grab your

2168
03:09:53,547 --> 03:09:58,817
hat to make sure it doesn't fly off your head, and
then you dive down into the alleyway. Come and

2169
03:09:58,817 --> 03:10:02,455
land, and you watch as two children that were
playing with sticks glance over and go, "Oh!"

2170
03:10:02,455 --> 03:10:05,613
SAM: Run along, now.

2171
03:10:05,613 --> 03:10:08,874
MATT: (screams) And they run out of the alleyway,
screaming around the corner.

2172
03:10:08,874 --> 03:10:11,537
SAM: I release Polymorph.

2173
03:10:11,537 --> 03:10:13,928
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2174
03:10:13,928 --> 03:10:18,513
SAM: You didn't tell me that the guards all hated
you.

2175
03:10:18,513 --> 03:10:23,369
TRAVIS: Only one, apparently. That is what happens
when you leave things alive.

2176
03:10:23,369 --> 03:10:25,296
SAM: You're right. We've learned a lesson today.

2177
03:10:25,296 --> 03:10:28,233
TRAVIS: Look, should we still look for the Lord of
the Quad Roads?

2178
03:10:28,233 --> 03:10:30,475
SAM: I feel like that ship has sailed.

2179
03:10:30,475 --> 03:10:32,087
TRAVIS: Which ship?

2180
03:10:32,087 --> 03:10:36,562
SAM: Maybe not. (sighs) Maybe we should go find
the others.

2181
03:10:36,562 --> 03:10:40,852
TRAVIS: All right. Temple of Sarenrae? Where is
that?

2182
03:10:40,852 --> 03:10:43,815
SAM: I know where it is. I've shat there before.

2183
03:10:43,815 --> 03:10:46,433
(laughter)

2184
03:10:46,433 --> 03:10:50,128
TRAVIS: Should I wear the hat, since I am
apparently a wanted person now?

2185
03:10:50,128 --> 03:10:52,488
SAM: Why don't I just make us both invisible?

2186
03:10:52,488 --> 03:10:54,228
TRAVIS: Can you do that?

2187
03:10:54,228 --> 03:10:55,385
SAM: Sure.

2188
03:10:55,385 --> 03:10:56,435
TRAVIS: Aces.

2189
03:10:56,435 --> 03:11:02,135
SAM: All right. 3rd-level Invisibility, right? I
can do me and another person?

2190
03:11:02,135 --> 03:11:08,919
MATT: I believe so, yeah. All right, so you both
turn invisible and you make your way towards the

2191
03:11:08,919 --> 03:11:10,342
temple of Sarenrae.

2192
03:11:10,342 --> 03:11:13,465
TRAVIS: Damn it.

2193
03:11:13,465 --> 03:11:19,518
MATT: As you guys are leaving the temple, this
wonderful appearance, you see commotion in the

2194
03:11:19,518 --> 03:11:22,527
distance, and you see guards rushing from street
to street.

2195
03:11:22,527 --> 03:11:24,928
LAURA: What's happening here?

2196
03:11:24,928 --> 03:11:28,311
MARISHA: Do you think that guy went and alerted
everyone about Vecna?

2197
03:11:28,311 --> 03:11:34,737
TALIESIN: Either that, or that guard we left alive
that one time ran into Grog and sounded the alarm.

2198
03:11:34,737 --> 03:11:36,087
It was probably Vecna.

2199
03:11:36,087 --> 03:11:41,884
MARISHA: Probably Vecna. Vecna's a much bigger
problem, right?

2200
03:11:41,884 --> 03:11:45,185
TALIESIN: What would be the odds of that one guard
seeing him? This is a very big city.

2201
03:11:45,185 --> 03:11:47,333
SAM: (clears throat) It was the guard.

2202
03:11:47,333 --> 03:11:49,470
MATT: You guys hear this voice out of nowhere.

2203
03:11:49,470 --> 03:11:55,683
SAM: It's us. We're here. We're next to you, but
we're invisible.

2204
03:11:55,683 --> 03:12:00,903
MARISHA: Did you get allegiance from the Lord of
the Crossroads? Right?

2205
03:12:00,903 --> 03:12:02,483
SAM: Not exactly.

2206
03:12:02,483 --> 03:12:04,479
LAURA: I'm reaching down for a head.

2207
03:12:04,479 --> 03:12:07,573
MATT: You don't find a head, but you find Grog.

2208
03:12:07,573 --> 03:12:19,619
TRAVIS: Thanks, Vex. You know, he was "indiposed."
We should go.

2209
03:12:19,619 --> 03:12:22,865
TALIESIN: Are you sure? We could spend some time
here.

2210
03:12:22,865 --> 03:12:24,026
TRAVIS: Nope!

2211
03:12:24,026 --> 03:12:26,823
LAURA: Don't you want to talk to Kord?

2212
03:12:26,823 --> 03:12:29,599
TALIESIN: Have a drink, see the local color?

2213
03:12:29,599 --> 03:12:38,030
TRAVIS: I can't really look like me in this city
right now. I punched a captain of the guard.

2214
03:12:38,030 --> 03:12:41,198
LAURA: You punched--

2215
03:12:41,198 --> 03:12:42,905
MARISHA: You were gone for what, 45 minutes?

2216
03:12:42,905 --> 03:12:44,445
TRAVIS: Was it that long?

2217
03:12:44,445 --> 03:12:46,040
LIAM: It was like 30.

2218
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:48,504
ASHLEY: It happened so fast.

2219
03:12:48,504 --> 03:12:56,765
SAM: There was an incident, in which we scared
many innocent people and assaulted several guards,

2220
03:12:56,765 --> 03:12:59,831
and they shot us with crossbows, and we are
bleeding.

2221
03:12:59,831 --> 03:13:03,184
LIAM: We just said goodbye to you.

2222
03:13:03,184 --> 03:13:05,189
SAM: I'm over here, actually.

2223
03:13:05,189 --> 03:13:08,874
(laughter)

2224
03:13:08,874 --> 03:13:19,022
LAURA: Let's fucking get out of here. Are we just
going to try to bamf to the fucking fields, or are

2225
03:13:19,022 --> 03:13:23,991
we going to talk to Melora, or are we going to
bamf to the fields and then go talk to Melora?

2226
03:13:23,991 --> 03:13:26,031
MARISHA: Melora doesn't exist on that plane.

2227
03:13:26,031 --> 03:13:28,236
LAURA: I know, but we'll have to come back here.

2228
03:13:28,236 --> 03:13:32,557
TALIESIN: I think the priests of the temple are
going to alert--

2229
03:13:32,557 --> 03:13:35,476
give them the basic story of Vecna.

2230
03:13:35,476 --> 03:13:42,223
LIAM: And also, dear. The communication system
that you and Percival

2231
03:13:42,223 --> 03:13:45,974
and Tary set up. Is it here?

2232
03:13:45,974 --> 03:13:49,172
MARISHA: No.

2233
03:13:49,172 --> 03:13:51,311
LIAM: Where's the closest?

2234
03:13:51,311 --> 03:13:56,334
MARISHA: The Fire Ashari. Why?

2235
03:13:56,334 --> 03:14:01,048
LIAM: Well, we've got two things on our plate,
right? We need to start--

2236
03:14:01,048 --> 03:14:03,119
MARISHA: Alerting the cities.

2237
03:14:03,119 --> 03:14:04,526
LIAM: Yes.

2238
03:14:04,526 --> 03:14:07,909
LAURA: Maybe you can send a message. Do you have
that ability?

2239
03:14:07,909 --> 03:14:09,184
MARISHA: No.

2240
03:14:09,184 --> 03:14:14,942
TALIESIN: To the Fire Ashari, and then to the
fields of Elysium?

2241
03:14:14,942 --> 03:14:16,122
LIAM: Yes.

2242
03:14:16,122 --> 03:14:18,978
TALIESIN: To the Fire Ashari, then to the fields
of Elysium.

2243
03:14:18,978 --> 03:14:20,476
MARISHA: All right, let's mist there.

2244
03:14:20,476 --> 03:14:25,526
LAURA: Is it fast to mist to the Fire Ashari?

2245
03:14:25,526 --> 03:14:27,788
TALIESIN: Just I Dream of Jeannie us there.

2246
03:14:27,788 --> 03:14:30,998
SAM: Wait, we're going to the Ashari? What
happened with Sarenrae?

2247
03:14:30,998 --> 03:14:32,411
TALIESIN: That's next.

2248
03:14:32,411 --> 03:14:34,290
LIAM: We're going to do that, we're just getting
the word out.

2249
03:14:34,290 --> 03:14:38,146
MARISHA: Misting to the Fire Ashari is not that
long, right?

2250
03:14:38,146 --> 03:14:41,662
MATT: In mist form, it won't take you but a few
hours.

2251
03:14:41,662 --> 03:14:43,609
MARISHA: That's what I thought. A couple of
hours.

2252
03:14:43,609 --> 03:14:45,692
MATT: More than that. Like four hours or so.

2253
03:14:45,692 --> 03:14:47,831
SAM: We're just getting a message to them?

2254
03:14:47,831 --> 03:14:51,422
TALIESIN: We're going to alert all of the major
cities of the continents

2255
03:14:51,422 --> 03:14:53,898
that things have gone pear-shaped.

2256
03:14:53,898 --> 03:14:55,493
MARISHA: Maybe we should Tree Stride there.

2257
03:14:55,493 --> 03:15:02,376
LIAM: While you were selling stuff on the black
market, Keyleth and Freddie here have been

2258
03:15:02,376 --> 03:15:07,498
building this system. They built it. In all the
major cities, they can get out an alarm.

2259
03:15:07,498 --> 03:15:08,747
SAM: Pretty cool.

2260
03:15:08,747 --> 03:15:10,593
MARISHA: I take that back. We Tree Stride.

2261
03:15:10,593 --> 03:15:15,200
MATT: Okay, then.

2262
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:19,784
MARISHA: Transport Via Plants. I always say that
wrong. Tree Stride's a 5th-level spell.

2263
03:15:19,784 --> 03:15:21,331
MATT: Tree Stride rolls off the tongue.

2264
03:15:21,331 --> 03:15:22,777
TALIESIN: Tree Stride.

2265
03:15:22,777 --> 03:15:24,069
MARISHA: Tree Stride.

2266
03:15:24,069 --> 03:15:31,075
TALIESIN: Stride like a tree. Seriously, that text
is really tiny. I've never taken it into account.

2267
03:15:31,075 --> 03:15:32,375
It makes me feel old.

2268
03:15:32,375 --> 03:15:34,010
MARISHA: I have a lot of stuff going on.

2269
03:15:34,010 --> 03:15:35,146
LAURA: Let's go!

2270
03:15:35,146 --> 03:15:41,591
MATT: Okay. So as you guys step through the
rapidly created doorway from one of the nearby

2271
03:15:41,591 --> 03:15:47,467
trees here in the Quad Roads, as you're heading
southward into that space, you pull through the

2272
03:15:47,467 --> 03:15:54,396
portal and end up falling outside of the
Cindergrove, in the cauldron that contains the

2273
03:15:54,396 --> 03:16:00,419
city of Pyrah, of the Fire Ashari. Within a short
time, you find yourself to the actual city of

2274
03:16:00,419 --> 03:16:04,306
Pyrah and make your way towards the home of
Cerkonos.

2275
03:16:04,306 --> 03:16:11,968
MARISHA: I immediately look for Cerkonos, tell him
what happened, light the fire orbs. The chaos

2276
03:16:11,968 --> 03:16:13,362
orbs. Crisis orbs.

2277
03:16:13,362 --> 03:16:21,937
MATT: Crisis orbs. No worries. Speaking with him
and letting him know the circumstance, he nods. "I

2278
03:16:21,937 --> 03:16:30,364
"do not know the extent in which this danger will
present itself, but we will light these orbs with

2279
03:16:30,364 --> 03:16:37,713
"what information we can. We rely upon you, soon,
to fill in the gaps of information."

2280
03:16:37,713 --> 03:16:41,071
MARISHA: The city--

2281
03:16:41,071 --> 03:16:44,935
TALIESIN: Thar Amphala.

2282
03:16:44,935 --> 03:16:46,189
MARISHA: Thar Amphala.

2283
03:16:46,189 --> 03:16:48,743
LAURA and MARISHA: Thar Amphala.

2284
03:16:48,743 --> 03:16:59,316
MARISHA: I believe it teleported somewhere in the
northern hemisphere. Somewhere in a cold region.

2285
03:16:59,316 --> 03:17:02,652
We think Wildemount.

2286
03:17:02,652 --> 03:17:04,324
LAURA: It was snowing.

2287
03:17:04,324 --> 03:17:07,819
TALIESIN: We barely escaped.

2288
03:17:07,819 --> 03:17:11,140
MARISHA: You might want to check in with our
contacts there.

2289
03:17:11,140 --> 03:17:14,010
They might have the best knowledge.

2290
03:17:14,010 --> 03:17:18,935
MATT: "In Wildemount, you say? It is a far way
away."

2291
03:17:18,935 --> 03:17:22,491
MARISHA: Well, that's why we're alerting you
first.

2292
03:17:22,491 --> 03:17:29,073
MATT: "We will put up the orbs and try and gather
what information we have."

2293
03:17:29,073 --> 03:17:33,778
LIAM: Let people know. Do you remember how bad the
Conclave was?

2294
03:17:33,778 --> 03:17:36,774
That's what we're talking about here.

2295
03:17:36,774 --> 03:17:38,270
MARISHA: Possibly worse.

2296
03:17:38,270 --> 03:17:41,440
MATT: "Very well."

2297
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:44,723
MARISHA: After this, I'm retiring.

2298
03:17:44,723 --> 03:17:47,309
LIAM: I'm getting too old for this shit.

2299
03:17:47,309 --> 03:17:52,612
MARISHA: We are going to be going to the blessed
fields of Elysium from here.

2300
03:17:52,612 --> 03:17:56,418
MATT: "I don't know where that is, but good
luck."

2301
03:17:56,418 --> 03:17:57,826
MARISHA: Thank you.

2302
03:17:57,826 --> 03:18:04,907
SAM: Dungeon Master, where's Vasselheim on this
map?

2303
03:18:04,907 --> 03:18:08,078
MATT: Vasselheim is in Issylra, which is the upper
left.

2304
03:18:08,078 --> 03:18:15,721
SAM: All the way up here? And didn't his internal
compass say 350 miles northwest?

2305
03:18:15,721 --> 03:18:17,111
MATT: Yep.

2306
03:18:17,111 --> 03:18:22,945
SAM: So we kind of know where he is, right?
Northwest?

2307
03:18:22,945 --> 03:18:30,915
MATT: Vasselheim is-- I'll have to show you where
it is. Vasselheim resides on this side.

2308
03:18:30,915 --> 03:18:33,401
SAM: Oh, so it's up at the peak?

2309
03:18:33,401 --> 03:18:35,769
MATT: Possibly.

2310
03:18:35,769 --> 03:18:39,474
SAM: Maybe up here.

2311
03:18:39,474 --> 03:18:41,134
LAURA: Whoa.

2312
03:18:41,134 --> 03:18:45,964
MARISHA: Okay, he might not be in Wildemount. I
don't know.

2313
03:18:45,964 --> 03:18:48,003
TALIESIN: He's in the north.

2314
03:18:48,003 --> 03:18:49,981
MARISHA: 350 miles northwest.

2315
03:18:49,981 --> 03:18:51,402
SAM: There's a real map here.

2316
03:18:51,402 --> 03:19:06,137
MATT: "I will light this beacon. Stay safe, and
good luck."

2317
03:19:06,137 --> 03:19:11,572
MARISHA: If you speak to the other Ashari and my
father, let him know.

2318
03:19:11,572 --> 03:19:13,361
MATT: "Immediately."

2319
03:19:13,361 --> 03:19:16,321
MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. Kaitiaki.

2320
03:19:16,321 --> 03:19:17,509
MATT: "Kaitiaki."

2321
03:19:17,509 --> 03:19:19,157
LAURA and ASHLEY: Kaitiaki.

2322
03:19:19,157 --> 03:19:20,586
MARISHA: Let's go.

2323
03:19:20,586 --> 03:19:22,531
LAURA: Plane Shift?

2324
03:19:22,531 --> 03:19:24,432
SAM: We're still invisible.

2325
03:19:24,432 --> 03:19:26,564
MARISHA: Do we need anything else?

2326
03:19:26,564 --> 03:19:30,352
LAURA: No, this is not going to be dangerous,
right? We're just going to

2327
03:19:30,352 --> 03:19:32,091
talk to some friendly people.

2328
03:19:32,091 --> 03:19:34,842
MARISHA: It's a good plane of existence.

2329
03:19:34,842 --> 03:19:46,267
MATT: You Plane Shift? All right, as you all put
your hands in each other's, you feel the familiar

2330
03:19:46,267 --> 03:19:53,530
sense of your physical form being drawn through
the barrier of the Prime Material Plane, and much

2331
03:19:53,530 --> 03:20:03,447
like when you transitioned to the Nine Hells, you
feel yourselves pulled into this temporary space,

2332
03:20:03,447 --> 03:20:11,884
this darkness, this sea of endless void with a
distant blinking of stars that shimmer. You

2333
03:20:11,884 --> 03:20:13,829
understand this as being the Astral Sea.

2334
03:20:13,829 --> 03:20:16,223
ASHLEY: (whispering) This is the Astral Sea.

2335
03:20:16,223 --> 03:20:23,204
MATT: They don't hear you say it because this is
so fast. You have no reason to have a conversation.

2336
03:20:23,204 --> 03:20:32,473
There before you, you see the glimmering, almost
burning lattice of the Divine Gate come streaking

2337
03:20:32,473 --> 03:20:38,140
towards you at immense speed, and you know you've
passed through comfortably once before, so you

2338
03:20:38,140 --> 03:20:43,167
hope and brace for impact and pass through again,
that warmth almost coming to a similar state of

2339
03:20:43,167 --> 03:20:48,905
burning, but then leaving you behind. And just as
fast, as it passes by you, you land, your feet

2340
03:20:48,905 --> 03:20:51,232
hitting ground, ground that gives.

2341
03:20:51,232 --> 03:20:53,403
LAURA: Three-point landing.

2342
03:20:53,403 --> 03:21:00,119
MATT: Okay. (impact) The ground gives a bit with
the impact, and as your eyes focus a bit on the

2343
03:21:00,119 --> 03:21:07,477
brightness around you, you can see above you a
clear blue sky, not a cloud in sight. Your hands

2344
03:21:07,477 --> 03:21:16,559
and feet a few inches deep into the sand-like
beach of some sort of an island, it seems. But it

2345
03:21:16,559 --> 03:21:21,829
is not sand. They're granules, pebbles, of what
appear to be shining pearls.

2346
03:21:21,829 --> 03:21:26,290
An entire beach of pearls.

2347
03:21:26,290 --> 03:21:28,470
LAURA: It really is heaven.

2348
03:21:28,470 --> 03:21:30,556
ASHLEY: This is so beautiful.

2349
03:21:30,556 --> 03:21:35,361
MATT: The water laps the edge of the shore not but
five feet behind you, an ocean that is clear and

2350
03:21:35,361 --> 03:21:48,919
lagoon-like. It's paradise. Looking ahead, you can
see the once-crumbling island, now finding renewed

2351
03:21:48,919 --> 03:21:55,243
strength with the renewed faith. You can see,
while there are no trees on this island, the hills

2352
03:21:55,243 --> 03:22:04,172
themselves seem to carry what seem to be old,
statuesque structures. Small temple-like oddities

2353
03:22:04,172 --> 03:22:12,488
that have been swallowed by time and the ravages
of the Calamity, slowly emerging like jagged bits

2354
03:22:12,488 --> 03:22:19,302
of earth that have been plunged up by seismic
activity. Beyond these hills, you see what looks

2355
03:22:19,302 --> 03:22:30,060
to you, familiar: a gargantuan crystal cathedral
that resembles the torso of a woman, but where the

2356
03:22:30,060 --> 03:22:36,379
head is, it spires into a singular point, and from
the inside, you see the flickering glow of what

2357
03:22:36,379 --> 03:22:42,552
seems to be a raging inferno that flickers like a
heartbeat from the inside of this crystal citadel.

2358
03:22:42,552 --> 03:22:49,940
Here you stand on the shores of the Island of
Renewal, and that's where we're going to end

2359
03:22:49,940 --> 03:22:50,956
tonight's session.

2360
03:22:50,956 --> 03:22:53,427
(impressed noises)

2361
03:22:53,427 --> 03:22:57,686
LAURA: How pretty! Last episode was so ugly, and
this episode's so pretty.

2362
03:22:57,686 --> 03:23:01,688
LIAM: You used to be a 4th or 5th-level cleric,
and now we're here!

2363
03:23:01,688 --> 03:23:03,740
LAURA: You talked to Sarenrae!

2364
03:23:03,740 --> 03:23:05,180
ASHLEY: I know. That is crazy!

2365
03:23:05,180 --> 03:23:07,777
LAURA: That's crazy.

2366
03:23:07,777 --> 03:23:11,684
LIAM: Started in Stillben, now we're here!

2367
03:23:11,684 --> 03:23:15,365
MARISHA and LAURA: Wow.

2368
03:23:15,365 --> 03:23:18,441
SAM: How far we've come.

2369
03:23:18,441 --> 03:23:22,095
TRAVIS: Look how far I've come!

2370
03:23:22,095 --> 03:23:26,529
MARISHA: Let's just give Vecna the Prime Material
Plane. Let's stay here!

2371
03:23:26,529 --> 03:23:30,133
New plan. New plan: stay here.

2372
03:23:30,133 --> 03:23:32,680
TALIESIN: New plan: mimosas.

2373
03:23:32,680 --> 03:23:37,508
MATT: Scanlan and Grog. Sam and Travis, left alone
to their devices.

2374
03:23:37,508 --> 03:23:39,156
TALIESIN: Wow.

2375
03:23:39,156 --> 03:23:41,319
SAM: We couldn't even walk across town!

2376
03:23:41,319 --> 03:23:45,307
TRAVIS: I was just trying to go see a man about a
wish. The trouble just comes to us.

2377
03:23:45,307 --> 03:23:50,158
MATT: As you were having this conversation, I'm
like, oh, it would be so funny if-- yeah, they're

2378
03:23:50,158 --> 03:23:52,056
not being careful. They're walking through the
street.

2379
03:23:52,056 --> 03:23:59,117
TRAVIS: I forgot that Doty knocked out the guards,
so I should have been like, oh, we rescued you

2380
03:23:59,117 --> 03:24:00,432
from this horror.

2381
03:24:00,432 --> 03:24:06,722
MATT: Doty knocked out the guards originally, it
was just that they followed you as you were

2382
03:24:06,722 --> 03:24:09,029
following them, and you're an accomplice.

2383
03:24:09,029 --> 03:24:12,263
TRAVIS: I didn't actually do anything because they
were unconscious.

2384
03:24:12,263 --> 03:24:15,407
MATT: Except for the shopkeeper that saw you.

2385
03:24:15,407 --> 03:24:18,372
TRAVIS: Again, got to kill them all.

2386
03:24:18,372 --> 03:24:21,552
SAM: For sure. Now we know.

2387
03:24:21,552 --> 03:24:23,903
TRAVIS: I think we've all learned a valuable
lesson.

2388
03:24:23,903 --> 03:24:25,278
MATT: No, we haven't.

2389
03:24:25,278 --> 03:24:27,236
TALIESIN: No one's learned anything of value.

2390
03:24:27,236 --> 03:24:29,278
SAM: How are we going to get you those wishes?

2391
03:24:29,278 --> 03:24:30,903
TRAVIS: He might have already used them.

2392
03:24:30,903 --> 03:24:34,444
TALIESIN: Probably used them. Probably really
wanted some ice cream.

2393
03:24:34,444 --> 03:24:40,307
MATT: I look forward for the viable possibility
for you returning for that conversation, because

2394
03:24:40,307 --> 03:24:46,112
that's going to be extremely funny. Anyway, guys.
Well done. So much fun. Thank you so much.

2395
03:24:46,112 --> 03:24:48,369
LAURA: Not a single dice in the dice jail.

2396
03:24:48,369 --> 03:24:49,385
MATT: Nope!

2397
03:24:49,385 --> 03:24:52,473

2409
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:46,026
