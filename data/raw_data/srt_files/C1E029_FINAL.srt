1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to this
evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,772
of us voice actors get together and roll dice like
we're awesome nerd people, which we are. So,

3
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:13,994
welcome! We're going to do a couple quick
announcements here before we kick things off. You

4
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,083
want to go ahead and start?

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:19,462
ZAC: Yeah, I'm that guy that you can't wait to
stop talking so the show can get started. So guys,

6
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:26,966
last week we hit 516 on the sub-train. Okay? And
each week, in theory, should grow by itself

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:34,088
because re-subs count. So basically, if we break
516 and make a new record, we will do a giant

8
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:42,139
giveaway which includes everything from Heroclix
to Steam keys to D&amp;D schwag, books from Felicia,

9
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:47,887
all sorts of stuff. It will be a giant box of
wonderful Geek and Sundry-related stuff. So that

10
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:54,674
is if we break 516, so there's a reason to keep
that train alive, guys. We are also very close to

11
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:59,114
hitting 10k. We are like 160 away from reaching
10,000 subscribers.

12
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:08,375
How many? 154 away from hitting 10k. Now you
guys may remember #noshavetil10k. I have not. If

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,710
we hit 10k, right when we hit, a straw poll will
be released into the chatroom, and you guys get to

14
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,289
vote on what my face gets shaved into for the next
week of programming on G&amp;S. And it is very

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:26,364
unfortunate that that's how we're going to do it.
So tomorrow night on Gather Your Party, it will be

16
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:30,262
Stef and Jessica's birthday, we're going to be
throwing a birthday party, and I'm going to let

17
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:34,534
them shave my face in whatever you guys vote on,
as a birthday present to them.

18
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:36,163
MARISHA: So many things.

19
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,616
MATT: The possibilities are endless.

20
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:42,700
ZAC: Just saying that out loud honestly hurts me.
A lot.

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,594
MATT: It is thick, too. You can get some nice
dimension in there.

22
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:45,943
ZAC: Great.

23
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,677
LIAM: Words, shave words in--

24
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,896
TALIESIN: You could build a bear in the beard.

25
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,431
ZAC: I could build a bear. Yeah. Great.

26
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:55,950
MATT: Can we shave off bits and then re-apply them
to other parts of the face?

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,267
ZAC: If you want to wear them, yeah!

28
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,591
MATT: Okay! I might do that, yeah.

29
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:04,478
ZAC: And then this weekend, Nerdist is running a
24-hour livestream for Extra Life. You guys may

30
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,837
recognize some of the faces that stop by. They are
going to be streaming from our set. So, let's

31
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,843
welcome them. We'll be hosting it, but I encourage
you guys all to head over to Nerdist,

32
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:19,354
twitch.tv/nerdist. This weekend it'll be Saturday
from 9AM to 9PM Pacific Standard Time. I will be

33
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:23,302
there the whole time helping out, as well as some
of our other Geek and Sundry hosts. So you guys

34
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:28,452
should check that out and help them be part of our
team, raising money for Extra Life. And Matt, I

35
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:31,913
wanted to thank you for helping us make Battle of
the Bands a success last week. We all know that

36
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:35,959
the voting was rigged and that's why your team
won, but it was a valiant effort nonetheless. And

37
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,222
if you guys enjoyed that, you should tweet at Geek
and Sundry's twitter and let them know, and we

38
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,841
will try to do things like that for you more in
the future. That's pretty much all I have. Let's

39
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:47,425
get to 10k and get this stupid stuff off my face.

40
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:53,967
MATT: Thank you very much, Zac. Speaking of
shaving, let me take a moment here to mourn the

41
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:59,292
Mercer-beard. Those who saw on twitter. I was
trying to hold off until 10k and Halloween for my

42
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:05,414
costume, but due to work, had to shave it as of
last night. So, I apologize. I'm in mourning. So

43
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:11,467
please bear with me for this evening, going
forward. Couple announcements. Critical

44
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:18,359
Role-related: we have a lot of our party in
transit right now. Laura and Travis just flew in

45
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,380
from Toronto and will probably be a little bit
late to the game. Sam is currently heading here

46
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,736
from a session and will get here as soon as
possible. Unfortunately, Orion will not be joining

47
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:32,514
us again this evening, but hope to have him back
next week for Halloween. So, things will get

48
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:37,795
rolling as they arrive. Thankfully, we're at a
situation in the game where I don't think it'll be

49
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:47,610
too halting. We shall see. Next announcement,
we're putting out Critical Role thematic

50
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,371
playlists. All the players have put together
playlists of Spotify songs that they feel

51
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:58,792
encapture aspects of their character and their
character's journeying as Vox Machina and in the

52
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:05,532
world of Exandria. So those will be releasing
every week, starting tonight at 8PM with Percy, I

53
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:10,120
believe. So Taliesin's playlist will be up
available on Geek and Sundry's website and--

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,297
TALIESIN: Dropping mad jams-- I'm not.

55
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:15,547
MARISHA: They're mad, you're allowed.

56
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,818
TALIESIN: I'm going to show you some music.

57
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:23,624
MARISHA: It's good. Go download Spotify right now,
so you can go, if you haven't. It's free!

58
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,647
MATT: There you go.

59
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,995
TALIESIN: It's cancer. It's been a weird
weeknight.

60
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,488
MARISHA: It has. It's been a long day.

61
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,420
TALIESIN: I had a strange day. I've infected
friends with Spotify now.

62
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,863
MATT: As you should. Infecting friends is fun.
Couple other things. For those who haven't seen it

63
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:48,059
already, the D&amp;Diesel videos went up earlier this
week, where we had the wonderful chance-- for me,

64
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,001
at least-- to Dungeon Master for a half an hour
for Vin Diesel, along with Travis and Laura, and

65
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:59,996
Jessica and Dan of Nerdist ilk. Had a great time,
so hopefully you liked it, and if you'd like to

66
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:03,312
see more stuff like that, hopefully we'll have
more things coming up in the future in that vein,

67
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:09,276
because we had a good time. Also, along with that,
I released my Witch Hunter class, which was a

68
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:15,722
customized 5th edition class that I designed after
I ran that game, based on the character I created

69
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:24,397
for Vin. It went up on the website, untested.
Feedback is always welcome, and I will be updating

70
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:30,145
it on the website as feedback comes in and
balancing is tweaked for it. But have at it, have

71
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:36,677
fun, hope you guys enjoy it. I had a good time
creating it, and it's a good time. Also, just a

72
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:41,313
reminder to you guys: our official Critical Role
t-shirts are available on the Geek and Sundry

73
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:46,315
website store if you want to wear any of the
awesome red shirts that we've shown on the show

74
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:53,410
with our full-on Critical Role logo. Shown in an
exemplary dark, fine ink. Those are available for

75
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,407
purchase.

76
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,408
MARISHA: And keychains.

77
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:59,698
TALIESIN: What if, due to some strange third-arm
syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way

78
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,381
I can show my support to the show?

79
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:06,354
MATT: Yes, you can. We have necklaces and
keychains with our logo as well. Also available on

80
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,060
the store. So, you're welcome to check those out.

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,689
TALIESIN: With my third arm, I need necklaces and
keychains.

82
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,833
LIAM: Three-armed shirts are coming in 2016.

83
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,798
MATT: Yeah, three-armed shirts will be on the
docket. Thank you, Liam,

84
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,063
I was trying to get to that.

85
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,895
MARISHA: There's a new shirt up. I didn't know
that.

86
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:21,608
MATT: We have a new shirt up?

87
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,719
OFFSTAGE: How do you want to do this.

88
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,399
MATT: We have it up?! This is good news to know.
We have now up on the store our official "How do

89
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,340
you want to do this" shirt as well. So you can go
check that out on the shop. Prepare for the

90
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,489
holiday season with your Christmases and your
Chanukahs and your Critmases and all that fun

91
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:45,268
stuff to make people look as nerdy as we are.
Which is I think part of my goal, personally,

92
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:46,382
through world domination.

93
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,850
(laughter)

94
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,359
MATT: Maybe not Liam. Everyone but Liam can look
weird. There's no way to help you.

95
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:56,727
LIAM: Can I just interject for a second only
because I'm hot as hell. I just want to thank

96
00:06:56,727 --> 00:07:02,001
@pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous
stealthy cloak. I'm going to take it off in about

97
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:08,233
two minutes, because it's more t-shirt weather
here in the studio. So I'll just let everybody

98
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:12,354
bask in the glow of my absence of light for two
minutes, and then I'm going

99
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:13,919
to switch to t-shirt mode.

100
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,232
TALIESIN: You're so stealthy.

101
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:16,564
MARISHA: Where'd Liam go?

102
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:19,939
MATT: It's mysterious.

103
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,010
MARISHA: Holy shit.

104
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,497
MATT: All righty. Also, our cast interviews on the
Geek and Sundry website are almost over. Orion's

105
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:30,068
went up today and those will be finishing up
shortly.

106
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:32,392
MARISHA: But we have Spotify lists to replace
them.

107
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:33,840
MATT: Yep, Spotify lists coming up.

108
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,217
MARISHA: So there's still more content.

109
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:38,164
MATT: If you've missed any of the cast interviews,
they're all available on the website. So feel free

110
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:39,186
to check them out.

111
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:40,240
MARISHA: Yeah.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,865
MATT: Marisha, you wanted to follow up on the
826LA news you had.

113
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:50,781
MARISHA: Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right
now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for

114
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:59,731
LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by
Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring

115
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:06,561
education and a brighter future for Los Angeles.
So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually

116
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:12,322
partnering together, and they're in this contest
right now. You have to go vote, and they could

117
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:24,074
potentially win $100,000. Which: awesome. And
we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you

118
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:31,387
have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods,
go find it on my twitter, or you can just search

119
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:37,322
#LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So,
yeah, go vote.

120
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:41,078
MATT: Team Hooman, Critters, come up there and
make this happen.

121
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:48,122
MARISHA: Also, they just announced they're going
to be opening an 826LA-- sorry, not 826LA, but an

122
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,439
826 in San Francisco!

123
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:50,527
MATT: Awesome!

124
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:51,825
TALIESIN: Another 826 in San Francisco?

125
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,173
MARISHA: Oh, is there another, I guess so.

126
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:55,211
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there's one there--

127
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,316
MARISHA: They might be opening a second one.

128
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,478
TALIESIN: They might be opening-- that would make
sense.

129
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,315
MARISHA: I think they said they announced they're
opening one. I think.

130
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,677
TALIESIN: I'm retweeting you right now.

131
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:02,948
MARISHA: Okay. Taliesin's retweeting me.

132
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:05,668
MATT: So there you go. Follow either of their
twitters to get the information.

133
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:07,222
MARISHA: But, go vote. Help them win 100k.

134
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:10,855
MATT: All right, Taliesin, you wanted to mention
something about Tara's--

135
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:15,548
TALIESIN: I do! Tara Platt, who is a wonderful
friend of the show and amazing voice actress and

136
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:21,038
extremely fabulous in many different ways; she's a
sky pirate, she does all sorts of crazy stuff.

137
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:26,231
She's got an Indiegogo for an interactive book
called, and I'm hoping I pronounce this right,

138
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:33,769
Zartana. You should check it out, it's really
cool, it's really pretty and beautiful. It's got a

139
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:41,169
very Stardust-y vibe. I've already picked up my
copy. So you should go, there's just a couple

140
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:45,788
days left, just hop in and grab a copy for yourself.
It's going to be really exciting. And--

141
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,553
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like about a g*psy girl, and
it's got a bunch of recipes, and it teaches you

142
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:58,258
how to make a bow, and has herb cards and all
sorts of cool stuff. I was into it immediately.

143
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:03,425
TALIESIN: For the cool child in your life this
Christmas. This would be for the kid who needs

144
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,291
something that's not quite outdoors, but not quite
a video game.

145
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,201
MARISHA: Zartana.

146
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,066
TALIESIN: Zartana.

147
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,127
MATT: There you go.

148
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:15,568
TALIESIN: Also, I will be in OniCon in Galveston,
Texas over Halloween. So, if you're in Galveston,

149
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:20,199
Texas and it's Halloween, and you want to go to an
anime con, I'll be there. And I'll be in costume,

150
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,907
and it will be pretty hilarious.

151
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:31,125
MARISHA: And last, but not least, last Thursday
while we were here, looking at dead versions of

152
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,485
ourselves hanging from a tree, Super Power Beat
Down won a Geekie!

153
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,594
LIAM: Oh! Mazel tov!

154
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:46,458
MARISHA: Yeah, glad I came here instead of going
to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a

155
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,861
Geekie. So, I thought I should say that.

156
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:49,778
LIAM: Well-earned.

157
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:50,611
MARISHA: Thanks.

158
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,612
LIAM: You nerd.

159
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:52,563
MATT: Good on you.

160
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:57,702
TALIESIN: You should wear it like bling. Get a
chain for it. That'd be great.

161
00:10:57,702 --> 00:10:59,955
MARISHA: Just, once again, like, it-- No.

162
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,178
TALIESIN: No. No, never mind.

163
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:04,254
MATT: All righty, any other announcements anyone
needs to make?

164
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,544
TALIESIN: God damn it, it keeps happening.

165
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:06,519
LIAM: I'm good.

166
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,671
MATT: All righty. Well then, let us go ahead and
get ourselves tuned in for tonight's episode of

167
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,440
Critical Role.

168
00:11:13,440 --> 00:12:22,708
[dramatic music]

169
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:27,771
MATT: And welcome back. So, everyone, our Sam
arrived--

170
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,056
SAM and TALIESIN: Samurai?

171
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:33,641
MATT: We have our samurai! Laura and Travis are in
transit, they'll be here as soon as they--

172
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,506
(thump from Sam's mug)

173
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:43,651
MATT: Well played. So. To give us a little
overview of the current story. Two nasty

174
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:48,931
individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady
Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been

175
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:56,752
occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once
the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully

176
00:12:56,752 --> 00:13:01,178
taken from his family, most of which seemingly
have been either killed or lost in the process,

177
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:06,215
and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox
Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon

178
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:12,004
in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods
retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to

179
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:18,146
come and say hello. Since then, the party has
prepared the best they could, made their way

180
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:23,364
towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of
infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into

181
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:30,008
the city itself. They, under the guise of
Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as

182
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:35,398
common folk as the rest of the poor saps that
still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an

183
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:41,869
abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs
as a base of operations, and also managed to come

184
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:48,260
across a central portion of Whitestone's city
structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a

185
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,817
tree once risen to the might of the god of the
sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town,

186
00:13:55,817 --> 00:14:03,074
and from it hung eight figures that appear to have
been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and

187
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:08,674
dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a
warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it

188
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:13,158
comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message
was definitely delivered. The party, retreating

189
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:20,658
back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of
the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic

190
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:25,914
magical ways, through the ground to find some of
the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an

191
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:31,471
extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of
restoring some semblance of life to the entity

192
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:41,319
itself. That is where we left off. While the rest
of you have been going about your preparations for

193
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:46,948
the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for
Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in

194
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:52,536
the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will
conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown.

195
00:14:52,536 --> 00:15:00,791
While she is down there, essentially meditating
with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there

196
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,706
anything you guys would wish to do, or are you
just waiting for her to complete her ritual?

197
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,592
TALIESIN: Well, there are options.

198
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:18,106
SAM: What do we need? We have to get water, right?
There was some issue about-- we don't have any

199
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,283
water, do we?

200
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,515
TALIESIN: Was that an issue?

201
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,364
SAM: I don't remember. There was some wells
around.

202
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:32,110
MARISHA: Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing
the ritual to see if this is a

203
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,525
curse over this tree?

204
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:38,887
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check, I
guess.

205
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:50,395
MARISHA: Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection
is in the way. Nine.

206
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:59,122
MATT: Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a
curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very

207
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:07,596
well-connected with the natural essences of the
world, the life essence of plants and natural

208
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:15,367
growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree
are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it

209
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:19,477
stands. But, as you continue your ritual--

210
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,485
MARISHA: God, I hope this works.

211
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,810
MATT: Anyone else have anything they want to do?

212
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,525
LIAM: Well, couple of things. Grog and I were
keeping watch. I forget, one of us was on the

213
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,845
first floor and one's on the second. I'm just
going to say that I was on the second for now.

214
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:39,471
Because I can't remember. It's probably wrong. I'm
going to take all daggers out of my Blinkback Belt

215
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:46,962
except for the Keen Dagger and replace them with
wooden stakes that I purchased. And I'm going to

216
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:52,290
spend an hour or so, whatever it takes to-- I've
got partial gloves on; I'm going to take that

217
00:16:52,290 --> 00:17:00,172
symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to take as much
time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed

218
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:11,032
firmly to the back of my right hand. I tell Grog
that I'm going to go down below and check, and I

219
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:15,734
follow the path all the way down to find-- I think
everyone else is down there.

220
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,943
SAM: Oh hi, Vax.

221
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:21,424
LIAM: I step over Scanlan's head and I kneel down
by Keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder

222
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:24,365
and say: What do you need? What can I get?

223
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:33,745
MARISHA: I don't really know. I don't know if this
is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is

224
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:37,230
dead. Do you have any of that holy water?

225
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,705
LIAM: I got holy oil. Not water.

226
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:53,706
MARISHA: Do I have holy water? I don't know if I
took one or not. I can't remember.

227
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,039
MATT: If you didn't write it down, it's not in
your inventory.

228
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,271
MARISHA: I'm pretty good about that. I don't think
I took one.

229
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,166
TALIESIN: In the meantime, there are options.

230
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:13,358
LIAM: I got two. I remember it. It was two vials
of holy oil. I gave one to my sister, and I have

231
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,272
the other. If you think it will help, you take
it.

232
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:20,866
MARISHA: Okay.

233
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,675
LIAM: Do you need me to get water?

234
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:24,937
MARISHA: Yeah, let's get some water.

235
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:30,368
MATT: Yeah, because as you guys went through the
tavern, you found there was no actual water. There

236
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:38,467
was old ale. There were still a few casks of wine.
Stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously

237
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:44,209
was the owner of this tavern either left
Whitestone or fell to a worse fate. But there was

238
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,283
no plain water to drink.

239
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:50,393
LIAM: I'm going to go out into the street. I'm
going to find water.

240
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:52,635
TALIESIN: I can show you where there's water.

241
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:53,748
SAM: What?

242
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,242
TALIESIN: I lived here my whole life.

243
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,724
SAM: Are you guys disguised?

244
00:18:56,724 --> 00:18:57,893
LIAM: Yeah, we all are.

245
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,916
MATT: They're still technically under your Seeming
spell, for the next few hours, at least.

246
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,616
MARISHA: Yeah, we cannot let that go.

247
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:08,440
SAM: Does that have a range? No, it just lasts.

248
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,886
MATT: As far as I know, it lasts just for an
eight-hour period. I'll double-check.

249
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,382
LIAM: Percival, do you want to come upstairs to
the window, and--

250
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:16,487
SAM: I'm coming.

251
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,617
LIAM: Oh, you're coming, too? All right. You're my
son, let's go.

252
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,028
(laughter)

253
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:26,085
MATT: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours and allows
you to change the appearance of--

254
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,625
SAM: Great. We're still peasants.

255
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,648
MARISHA: Remember, we also have Heroes' Feast up.

256
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:30,995
TALIESIN: Yeah.

257
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,387
SAM: Oh, okay.

258
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,871
MARISHA: Advantages on wisdom throws and whatnot.

259
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:36,670
TALIESIN: Hit point bonus, advantage on wisdom
throws--

260
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,133
MARISHA: Yeah. 2d10 hit points. Max hit points.

261
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:47,582
TALIESIN: I have my advantages still. So I'm going
to lead them to the closest well.

262
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,831
MATT: Okay. Stealthily?

263
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:55,359
MARISHA: I'm going to start-- I've kind of cleared
out around the roots.

264
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:04,526
MATT: It's a lot. It's earth and then giant roots
from a very large tree that go past. You aren't at

265
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:08,532
the bottom of the roots. You've met the roots as
you were carving through. They go even deeper than

266
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:09,979
where you are right now.

267
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:15,654
MARISHA: Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine
around it for where we're going to start pouring

268
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:16,772
the water?

269
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:25,406
MATT: If you've already started the eight-hour
process of the secondary spell, you would not be

270
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:29,133
able to really interrupt that to be able to
continue another spell you've been doing. I could

271
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,666
say that you did that as part of your preparation
for the roots. That's fine. That's fine. It'd be a

272
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,457
small ravine, because you also don't want to--

273
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,748
MARISHA: Damage anything.

274
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:42,436
MATT: You continue your ritual. The rest of you
make your way out the same window that you

275
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:49,608
entered, into the alleyway, following Percival.
You lead them to the back of the tavern into one

276
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:58,537
of the large alleyways between this chunk of the
city. You find there was a grassy area; most of

277
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:06,200
the grass here has turned gray and brittle, as it
is starting to push towards the winter months. And

278
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:13,980
even for the daytime, the temperature is pretty
chilly. It's probably around 50 or so degrees, 55.

279
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:24,777
Fahrenheit, for our un-American friends.
Eventually, you make your way to the nearest well

280
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:28,746
that you've been to. And there is a bucket there.
It looks like it has gathered some dust and some

281
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:34,350
cobwebs. You get the bucket, and you let it down,
and eventually it finds its way into the water.

282
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,268
It's pretty deep before it hit the water. You
don't know if it's been just, like, water level,

283
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:43,910
or if this particular well itself is drying up.
But you manage to get a bucket up, and you pull it

284
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:51,922
up and check it and it looks clear. You take the
water back with you to the tavern. Seemingly

285
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:55,751
uneventful. You guys have managed to stay far
enough out of sight. Nothing seems to caught your

286
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,291
attention.

287
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:05,187
SAM: Okay. Should we scout around and see if
there's anything else around the hideout that we

288
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:08,973
should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or
safehouses?

289
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:13,183
LIAM: I feel like we should probably bring a
little more water than one bucket. So we should

290
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:20,727
spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe
my sister and I can have a look around, see if

291
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:23,184
there's anything that we've missed. Outside.

292
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:31,266
TALIESIN: Well, here's the question. There's three
lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs,

293
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:41,777
for now. There's a few shops that if we feel might
be in our best interest to scout out. I know where

294
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:49,751
an old weapons depot used to be. We could check
the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find

295
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,549
some support to begin with.

296
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,292
LIAM: Do we trust anyone here?

297
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:54,865
SAM: We need friends.

298
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:58,193
TALIESIN: There might be people I trust.

299
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:00,865
SAM: Is there a central meeting place?

300
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:02,984
TALIESIN: There's a temple.

301
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:09,736
SAM: Is that a place where you can really chat up
brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's

302
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,483
not really a pub town, is it?

303
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:14,569
TALIESIN: It's not a pub town. And it's a place
where you don't necessarily chat up new people,

304
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:16,196
but maybe find some old ones.

305
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,897
SAM: Okay. We could go there.

306
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:23,821
LIAM: Percival, we're on your turf, so I'll follow
your lead.

307
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:31,067
TALIESIN: (sighs) If we have just enough time, I'd
like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery.

308
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:36,920
Leave, maybe Grog and Vex to guard Keyleth.

309
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,412
MATT: Okay. So, Keyleth, you're staying behind to
finish the ritual?

310
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:43,950
MARISHA: I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all
my energy on this thing.

311
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:51,328
MATT: There are two temples in here. There's the
temple to Pelor, which is known as the Zenith.

312
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:52,463
Within the graveyard.

313
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:54,336
TALIESIN: Yes, the Zenith is the one I wanted to
go to.

314
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,737
SAM: What's the other one?

315
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:58,844
TALIESIN: The other one is called The Lady's
Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis.

316
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:00,115
SAM: That sounds fun.

317
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,530
TALIESIN: I don't know anybody there.

318
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,850
SAM: I might!

319
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,267
TALIESIN: That's what I'm afraid-- they might know
you, so no.

320
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:10,565
MATT: So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to
Erathis, is more central to the city and is

321
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:21,340
partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome
amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your

322
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,700
way through the city. I'll have you all roll
stealth checks if you could.

323
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,985
SAM: We're not trying to hide, are we?

324
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:31,348
MATT: Well, if you're not trying to hide, then
make deception checks instead.

325
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:35,040
TALIESIN: Awesome possum.

326
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,346
SAM: I rolled an 18 for something.

327
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:40,623
LIAM: Can I choose to hide instead of deceive?

328
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:41,922
MATT: If you'd like to.

329
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,002
LIAM: Yeah, I'll hang a little bit back from
them.

330
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:45,588
TALIESIN: I was trying to be stealthy, as well.

331
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:46,583
MATT: Okay.

332
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,840
TALIESIN: Although I'm fine either way. 23.

333
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,696
SAM: I'm better deceiving.

334
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:52,811
MATT: Okay.

335
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,391
LIAM: 26.

336
00:24:55,391 --> 00:25:00,945
MATT: So we have two folks staying to the shadows,
best they can in broad daylight in a clustered

337
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:08,127
city. And one child-looking pauper of a boy
wandering through the city alone towards the

338
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:17,356
graveyard. As you guys make your way through,
staying off to the side, jumping, or running

339
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:23,694
through buildings and staying off the main path,
you walk along the central road to the far eastern

340
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:30,332
side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during
the day, some are carrying bundles of textile

341
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:34,755
goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and
it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either

342
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:39,878
to or from a store of some kind. Gives you a
curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but

343
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,915
doesn't seem to--

344
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,173
SAM: G'day, sir!

345
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:47,311
MATT: "G'day!" And just keeps rolling along, the
wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road.

346
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:48,787
SAM: I wish I had a yo-yo.

347
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:51,511
TALIESIN: How about a wheel and stick?

348
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,269
SAM: Oh, the wheel and stick would be good.

349
00:25:54,269 --> 00:26:02,480
MATT: Eventually, you guys make your way to the
far eastern side of Whitestone. This is where the

350
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,698
boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from
a defensive standpoint lies. There is the multiple

351
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:16,222
exit points throughout this wall. You dart around
the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the

352
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:22,477
pattern of the undead giants that are slowly
stomping through the city, like these hulking

353
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:29,850
sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through
the town. You follow the winding path through the

354
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:37,970
thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of
the city itself. You sticking to the path in your

355
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,443
open way, or do you want to join them in the side
of the forest?

356
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:45,951
SAM: Well, I've got to stick with them, I guess,
although I like being a young peasant boy. It's

357
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:48,781
kind of fun. All right, I'll go with them.

358
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:56,834
MATT: All right. So the three of you dart off into
the woods, skirting the outside of the road, but

359
00:26:56,834 --> 00:27:03,014
making your way following it to the outside of the
graveyard itself. Eventually, you come to the

360
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:10,259
outside of the graveyard. Large iron fence that
marks the outside of it. It's rusted from time,

361
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:17,805
small spikes mark the very top of it, about six
feet tall, and the gate itself is partially open.

362
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:22,516
With a little bit of breeze that's blowing
through, very, very cold breeze that blows through

363
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:29,650
this part of the forest, it's opening a little
bit, and (creak) against itself. You push through

364
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,710
the gate--

365
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,230
LIAM: Wait a minute, nope. Let me look. I'm just
going to move in, ten feet ahead,

366
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,280
and see what I see.

367
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,433
MATT: Okay.

368
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:43,008
LIAM: That is a 23 for perception.

369
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:50,571
MATT: Okay. You skirt up and look inside. And
there's a handful of trees in little clusters here

370
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:59,016
and there, but for the most part this old
graveyard is flat land, with just stones set up

371
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:05,602
throughout. The older stones have very little
rhyme or reason to their placement. They're

372
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:12,180
sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to
be more clustered with family names. This

373
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,294
definitely looks like something that was put here
when the town was founded and has been slowly

374
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,624
expanded over time, and it's not uniform.

375
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:23,479
LIAM: I hiss back at Percy: is this the way to
your temple?

376
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:24,647
TALIESIN: (whispers) Yes.

377
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:25,701
LIAM: Through here?

378
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:26,893
TALIESIN: Yes.

379
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:33,591
MATT: You do see, a little ways ahead in the
center of this open barren area, there is a stone

380
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:39,258
temple that has, from what little you can see, a
bit of stained glass pattern to it.

381
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:44,193
LIAM: Do we knock?

382
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:47,583
SAM: Is it safe? Should we go up?

383
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,173
TALIESIN: We go up to the doors, and give it a
tug.

384
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,650
MATT: Okay. Percy walks up to the doors.

385
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,334
LIAM: Well, all right.

386
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,892
TALIESIN: This is my neighborhood. I feel
comfortable.

387
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:00,391
MATT: Okay. You--

388
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,295
SAM: All right, Papa, let's go.

389
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:13,394
MATT: You go to the doors of the temple, the large
wooden doors. In them are carved this flaming

390
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:19,422
wreath into the wood. It looks almost like the
outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and

391
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:24,688
going across the sky where you can see the waving
flames licking the sides of the actual doors. And

392
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:34,245
it is a double door. As you tug on the handle at
the front, it gives very little to you. You give a

393
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:39,080
little more of a tug on it, not enough to gather
attention, just enough to really see if it's just

394
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,375
stuck, or if it's locked. And it appears that the
doors are not opening.

395
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,692
LIAM: And I look--

396
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:50,003
SAM: This is what he does!

397
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:55,173
LIAM: It is what I do. This is an old, old type of
lock, hold on.

398
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:56,645
MATT: There is no lock, actually.

399
00:29:56,645 --> 00:30:00,507
LIAM: There's no lock? Oh, but I rolled a natural
20. Does that help? Let me get through the door?

400
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,433
TALIESIN: Suddenly, a lock appears! Utterly
pickable!

401
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:04,715
(laughter)

402
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,988
MARISHA: Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable
lock I've ever seen!

403
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:15,975
MATT: There is no lock. It is barred from the
other side. There is some heavy wooden plank that

404
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:18,994
is currently set on the other side of the door.

405
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:20,757
LIAM: Oh, where's Grog when you need him?

406
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:26,200
MATT: So, with your expertise in these sort of
circumstances, you know that with the proper

407
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,531
placement of a long blade and enough strength and
weight put at the right fulcrum point, you can

408
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:36,423
probably shimmy it off, and it may take a little
bit of teamwork to do so.

409
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:40,179
LIAM: Okay who's got a-- mine are all very small.
Do you have a shortsword?

410
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:47,259
SAM: Everything I have is short. I can just go in
there and open it from the inside.

411
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:52,425
LIAM: Oh, right. I always forget.

412
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:57,822
SAM: It's not concentration, so I can just jump in
there.

413
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,770
MATT: Essentially.

414
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,576
LIAM: Don't fuse with a church pew.

415
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,949
MATT: If you're referring to a Dimension Door--

416
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:07,257
SAM: Correct. It's not concentration, I don't
think.

417
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:08,990
MATT: No, it is not concentration.

418
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,927
LIAM: More of a sneeze.

419
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:16,556
MATT: You can visualize it. It doesn't have to be
a place you have seen yet.

420
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:19,577
SAM: I can say I want to go ten feet in that
direction.

421
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,606
MATT: Yep.

422
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:26,458
SAM: Before I do, why are we trying to get in
here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't

423
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,967
think there's anyone in there.

424
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:31,859
TALIESIN: I would like to find out what happened.

425
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,767
SAM: Okay, good enough for me. I go in.

426
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:42,848
MATT: Okay. (spoof) With a burst of dark purplish
energy, Scanlan steps through the door, leaving no

427
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,589
mark or trace behind. On the other side you hear
this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the

428
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:55,835
opposite side, completing his transition. You
appear now in the central worship hall of the

429
00:31:55,835 --> 00:32:02,730
Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see
there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained

430
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,579
glass windows, about every ten feet around this
pattern, it looks like three to each side. There

431
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:13,560
are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and
worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed

432
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,595
off to the side, set astray, some have been
destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner

433
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:23,720
of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There
is a red carpet that marks the center that goes

434
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:31,050
all the way to what looks like a raised altar on
the opposite side of the room. You can see that

435
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:36,263
some of the stained glass further down has been
shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight

436
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:45,900
creeps through. You can see there is on the altar
a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this

437
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,711
distance. Make a perception check.

438
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:51,264
LIAM: (muffled) Scanlan! Open the door.

439
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:55,427
SAM: We do have earrings. 17.

440
00:32:55,427 --> 00:33:03,509
MATT: There appears to be something on the the
altar in the distance, small and scattered about

441
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:07,673
it, but from this distance, it's hard to make out
the details. But you hear

442
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:10,158
Vax muffled through the door.

443
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,786
SAM: All right, how big is this thing that's
keeping the door shut?

444
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:19,447
MATT: It's about eight feet wide and about a
foot-- eight feet long, about a foot wide and

445
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:22,052
about six inches thick. A big old piece of wooden
board.

446
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:23,150
SAM: A couple hundred pounds?

447
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,968
MATT: I would say it probably weighs about 40 or
50 pounds.

448
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:30,201
SAM: 40 or 50 pounds?!

449
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,463
MATT: It's wood. It's porous.

450
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:33,634
SAM: And how high off the ground? Could I touch
it?

451
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:37,069
MATT: You could touch it. It gets to about your
head, a little higher.

452
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:39,500
SAM: All right. I'm going to try and lift it off.

453
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,578
MATT: Go ahead a make a strength check. Athletics!
Make this athletics.

454
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:47,187
SAM: Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!

455
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:51,624
MATT: (grunting) From this position, it's not even
budging.

456
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:58,060
LIAM: All right, Scanlan, step back from the door
a couple of paces. I'm going to stick a blade

457
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,116
through the door.

458
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:02,309
SAM: It's not going to do much. There's a big
heavy thing.

459
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:08,260
LIAM: I'm going to hold on one side, you're going
to hold on the other, and we'll do it together.

460
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,060
Percy, can I borrow your blade?

461
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,621
TALIESIN: I've never used this. I've had it since
I created the character and I've never used

462
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:21,441
this blade once. This is the most use it's ever
gotten. I pull out this pristine piece of shit

463
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:27,774
(laughs) I don't even remember. I think I found it
in a dungeon. It's terrible.

464
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,384
MATT: What is it?

465
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:39,321
TALIESIN: It's a boarding sword, it was one of
those little curved swords.

466
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,072
MATT: Right. A scimitar or falchion.

467
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:44,638
TALIESIN: A scimitar. But short. It was nothing,
it was terrible.

468
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:45,731
LIAM: It's all we need.

469
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,888
TALIESIN: Yeah so. Get it in there.

470
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:51,864
LIAM: Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap
it around the blade. You're going to lift on your

471
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:53,522
side; we're going to lift on this side.

472
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:54,830
SAM: I get the sharp side?!

473
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,460
LIAM: I can't get the handle through the crack in
the door.

474
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,132
SAM: All right. I feel like there's some sort of
spell I could use.

475
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:04,211
All right, let's just do it your way.

476
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,937
LIAM: Got that Bigby's Hand, is that what you're
saying?

477
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,542
SAM: Yeah, I've got a million things I could do.

478
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:09,885
TALIESIN: Are any of them concentration spells?

479
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:15,550
SAM: Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've
also got a potion of strength.

480
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,479
MATT: As a note, Seeming isn't concentration.

481
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,635
SAM: I thought it was.

482
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:22,307
MATT: No. You cast it and it lasts for eight
hours. You don't need to worry about that.

483
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:24,091
SAM: No, I want to follow this through.

484
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,631
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.

485
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,508
LIAM: All right. Can we lift it together?

486
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:36,180
MATT: (laughs) We can try. All right, so. This is
going to be the three of you as a skill challenge,

487
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,195
I want all three of you to roll. Not athletics,
just a straight strength roll.

488
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:44,124
TALIESIN: One, two, three.

489
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:46,774
MATT: Add your strength modifier.

490
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:48,023
TALIESIN: 16!

491
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,668
SAM: Plus strength. 12.

492
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:53,741
(laughter)

493
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:58,386
SAM: Wait, did you get a four? Four? We are the
worst! We are the weakest ones.

494
00:35:58,386 --> 00:36:01,151
Oh, I cut my hand!

495
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:03,890
MATT: Which is exactly what happens.

496
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,380
TALIESIN and LIAM: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!

497
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,158
SAM: I'm going to take damage.

498
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:14,061
MATT: Yeah. First and foremost, you take four
points of slashing damage to your hand. You pull

499
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:17,470
back, and there is a line of blood now, beginning
to drip off your hand. You shake it amongst

500
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:20,428
yourself.

501
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:24,973
SAM: Oh, I can't say "God damn it" in here.
I'm in Pelor's-- Sorry, Pelor.

502
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,440
TALIESIN: Let's use a sword, I want to see how
this plays out.

503
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,115
SAM: God bless you. Gesundheit, Pelor. Man, all
right. Well, jeez Louise.

504
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:35,892
LIAM: Whip out the purple hand, man!

505
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:44,812
SAM: Seems like overkill. What about a
Thunderwave? Can I do that?

506
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:46,421
MATT: Certainly.

507
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:51,642
SAM: All right. Does it only affect living things?
Or does it affect--

508
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,795
LIAM: Wait. Scanlan, are there any windows in
there?

509
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:59,287
SAM: There are. There are windows. Good call.

510
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:04,844
MATT: It's a blast of thunderous energy in an area,
it would affect living and nonliving matter, yes.

511
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:06,087
LIAM: Hold on, this is stupid.

512
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:07,087
SAM: Are you sure?

513
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:09,230
TALIESIN: We are going to the window. We are going
to the window.

514
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,261
SAM: No, let's carry this out.

515
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:19,357
TALIESIN: No! We are going to the window. Please
do not destroy the temple of Pelor.

516
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:21,427
SAM: Three hours later, we are still trying to
open the door.

517
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:24,536
MARISHA: It's not even locked. It's just heavy.

518
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:30,163
SAM: I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand.

519
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:31,856
LIAM: Which way to the window? I can walk to the
window.

520
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:35,062
SAM: It's up there. You can make it, but Percy
can't.

521
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,811
LIAM: I can probably lift that door bar from
inside.

522
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,025
SAM: You could, probably.

523
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,214
LIAM: With your help, son.

524
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:44,086
SAM: Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very
dramatic.

525
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:50,065
LIAM: Let's save that for important stuff. All
right, where is the window? Which way do I go?

526
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:52,893
SAM: To the right and up.

527
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:57,679
MATT: There are windows shattered on both sides.
They're broken a little higher up. So you could

528
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:01,321
either continue to break the bottom part of the
window, or just attempt to leap through the hole.

529
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,441
LIAM: Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.

530
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:04,284
MATT: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check.

531
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,115
LIAM: All right.

532
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,385
SAM: The saga of the door!

533
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,924
MARISHA: It's just a door, you guys! It's just a
door.

534
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:09,932
LIAM: 25.

535
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:15,998
MATT: 25. You get a running start, leap off the
side and parkour up between the actual-- there is

536
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:21,408
an extension to the side where another room is
attached on each side of the temple towards the back.

537
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:26,612
You leap off that wall onto the small pillar
that's holding the side of the window and up

538
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:31,756
through the broken portion of the stained glass,
landing, three-point landing, on the inside. You

539
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:36,820
almost land in one of the shattered piles of
wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood

540
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:42,856
sticking out of it. About a foot away from you,
and you are like, "Oh, that was close." You see

541
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:46,178
Scanlan across the way. You see the altar to your
right.

542
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:49,312
SAM: Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand!

543
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:55,903
LIAM: Builds character. I'm going to stay away
from the altar and skirt the wall all the way

544
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:56,869
around it.

545
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,478
Mat: Okay, you get to the door.

546
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,512
LIAM: I'm going to try to help. Do you want to
help me lift this thing?

547
00:39:01,512 --> 00:39:02,705
SAM: With my good hand, yes.

548
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:05,825
MATT: Have both you guys make strength checks.

549
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:15,528
SAM: You know what, I'm going to get some
assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist.

550
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:17,404
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

551
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:18,588
SAM: He is going to lift with us.

552
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:24,776
MATT: With a brief burst of wind energy, a
shimmering form, somewhat humanoid in shape, but

553
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,179
still amorphous appears.

554
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,349
SAM: Hi, Darrell.

555
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:33,977
MATT: (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up
against the bottom of the wooden bar. Make your

556
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:35,852
check, as well.

557
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:39,465
SAM: That was a six. Is that for me?

558
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:45,069
MATT: That's for you, and then roll and add five
for your Unseen Servant.

559
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:50,687
SAM: So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No?

560
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,041
MATT: Roll again, add five.

561
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:56,313
SAM: Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine.

562
00:39:56,313 --> 00:40:05,276
MATT: The three of you, one mystically summoned
from a plane beyond your own, cannot seem to budge

563
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:12,994
this single wooden door! You've defeated
beholders. You've slaughtered illithid underneath,

564
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:19,456
in the Underdark, deep in the belly of the planet.
But this door bests you!

565
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,332
MARISHA: Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing
shit!

566
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,225
SAM: All right, I'm doing it. Step back!

567
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,316
LIAM: Whip out the hand!

568
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:31,664
SAM: All right, I summon Bigby's Hand! The
mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door, ever!

569
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:34,187
(singing) Bigby's Hand!

570
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:42,348
MATT: This giant, glimmering, purple fist appears
in your vicinity. It grabs the bottom. Go ahead

571
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:43,728
and roll a d20.

572
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,458
LIAM: Come on.

573
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,756
SAM: 12.

574
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:47,973
MATT: Plus eight to it.

575
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:49,217
SAM: Plus eight? 20!

576
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:51,280
TALIESIN: How do you want to do this?

577
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:00,267
MATT: With its finger, just goes (ping) and it
(thudding noises). The door (creak) opens up and

578
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,358
Percy stands there, looking not very happy.

579
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,245
TALIESIN: Was it overkill? Because really it took
that.

580
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:08,314
SAM: It took three spells to open this door! Three
spells!

581
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:10,377
TALIESIN: It's not overkill if you used what it
took.

582
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:13,234
SAM: Three spells and I injured myself.

583
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:22,773
TALIESIN: We took damage from an inanimate object.
Oh god! Get it out of our system now!

584
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,391
SAM: Welcome, Percy.

585
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:32,670
TALIESIN: Oh god! All right, I'm looking around,
taking in the damage. Anything that I notice is

586
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:38,692
particularly out of whack from the last time I was
here? Other than they're upgrading the locks,

587
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,280
apparently.

588
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:53,624
MATT: Looking about the place, it looks
pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used

589
00:41:53,624 --> 00:42:01,068
in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that
was broken, was broken from the outside in. So,

590
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:05,621
definitely seems like there was someone throwing a
rock through, or a intrusion from an outside

591
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:12,328
standpoint. As you walk further and look around,
the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed.

592
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:17,872
There is the altar on the top, and you do see,
there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side

593
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:26,019
of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit
candles, and there are some braziers. One to each

594
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:33,595
side of the altar, and one against each wall. All
of them appear to be long dark and out. Go

595
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,699
ahead and make a perception check.

596
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,824
SAM: All of us?

597
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,193
MATT: All of you.

598
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:40,723
SAM: 15.

599
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:42,584
TALIESIN: 15.

600
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:50,032
MATT: You both, as you approach the far side of
the temple towards the altar, you notice the

601
00:42:50,032 --> 00:43:02,374
brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently.
Just a very faint glow of ember to it.

602
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,006
LIAM: What's the matter?

603
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:05,021
TALIESIN: Reynal?

604
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:06,363
SAM: Who? Reynal?

605
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:17,796
TALIESIN: Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal?
Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the

606
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,280
door on the right.

607
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:27,668
MATT: You step up. You can see now, on top of the
altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials

608
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:33,150
that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You
can see bits of broken glass across the bottom,

609
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,016
the one step that leads down from the altar's
raised platform.

610
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:38,750
TALIESIN: Can I dip and smell?

611
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,744
MATT: Make an investigation check.

612
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:43,764
TALIESIN: 13.

613
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:52,792
MATT: 13? Okay. Looking at just the general
vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's

614
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:58,271
definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't
really determine it. But, just touching it to

615
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:02,831
your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second
and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear

616
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:13,048
out a little bit from the scent. There is some
random powders and such that've been brushed off.

617
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:18,673
You get the feeling that the way that all this was
treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed

618
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:25,613
more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a
perception check.

619
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:30,351
TALIESIN: 20.

620
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:35,831
MATT: 20? Okay, looking about the outside of the
altar, you do notice that around the brazier that

621
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:45,780
is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash
there, gathered on the inside of the brazier and a

622
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,756
little bit on the floor, around its base.

623
00:44:47,756 --> 00:44:51,996
SAM: Okay.

624
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:55,088
TALIESIN: Someone has been working on something in
here.

625
00:44:55,088 --> 00:45:00,017
SAM: It couldn't just be ash from the thing that
is burning?

626
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:03,755
MATT: If you look at the other braziers, there is
no ash around it. Most of the ash is contained.

627
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:09,916
The wood ash itself tends to fall; it's a little
heavier. This seems to be a lighter shade of ash

628
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:15,947
and it's more of a-- has found its way out of the
brazier from just the heat and the air.

629
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:21,445
TALIESIN: I want to smell the ash. Does it smell
like some sort of-- is it perfumed?

630
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:26,907
MATT: You lean down and you take some of the ash
in your fingers and smell it. It's not perfumed,

631
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:33,411
but you've had some experience with dealing with
various burning materials: this is definitely

632
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:40,370
paper-based ash. You do also notice underneath the
brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not

633
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,769
wholly burned.

634
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,480
SAM: Paper.

635
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,168
MARISHA: (whispering) Paper.

636
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:49,134
SAM: It's a golden ticket.

637
00:45:49,134 --> 00:46:01,490
TALIESIN: "Without sufficient magical essence the
distillation is proven to consistently fail. A

638
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:06,408
"shame, really. I shall seek an influx of materials
elsewhere before I can continue this project.

639
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:12,710
"Regarding the weapon, after a year of taking notes
from eyewitness accounts, my original designs were

640
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,155
"faulty and recently cost me my hand. The wind of
fortune has seen a shift it seems as Sylas just

641
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:24,454
"returned from Emon, having encountered the
still-living subject, and had the pleasure of

642
00:46:24,454 --> 00:46:30,456
"seeing his work first-hand. His unnatural eyes
took in much detail. I believe his observations

643
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:38,195
"have brought me to the brink of finishing my
design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within

644
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:42,450
"a couple of months to gather the components
needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the

645
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:47,325
"subject is heading here. I may find myself needing
to leave sooner than anticipated."

646
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:50,628
LIAM: They're trying to copy your work.

647
00:46:50,628 --> 00:46:51,791
SAM: Copy?

648
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:55,531
TALIESIN: Why?

649
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:59,997
LIAM: For war.

650
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:08,176
TALIESIN: I want to take another look at
everything that was on the altar, and I want to

651
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:09,676
see if it looks--

652
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:12,930
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

653
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,521
TALIESIN: 18.

654
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:20,643
MATT: Testing what's there: I mean, a lot of the
material has been scattered and mixed but there

655
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:28,437
are elements that resemble the black powder you've
used in some of your constructs and tinkering in

656
00:47:28,437 --> 00:47:29,879
the past.

657
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:31,317
SAM: They're making guns!

658
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:38,828
TALIESIN: Well, we know we're looking for someone
without a hand.

659
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:41,082
SAM: To do what?

660
00:47:41,082 --> 00:47:43,713
TALIESIN: To find out who's trying to copy my
work.

661
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:47,510
SAM: Someone who is working with Sylas, right?

662
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,186
TALIESIN: Yes. Let's check the rest of the
temple.

663
00:47:50,186 --> 00:47:51,589
LIAM: Yes.

664
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:56,210
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was
there a small something on the altar?

665
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,906
MATT: What you noticed were like some of the glass
vials that were overturned.

666
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:01,272
TALIESIN: What's in the pouches?

667
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:06,302
MATT: Looking at the pouches, it looks like some
of them contained phosphorus, some of them

668
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:11,565
contained other alchemical reagents that were used
in the research but most have been emptied, and

669
00:48:11,565 --> 00:48:13,538
it's just a residuum on the inside.

670
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:15,488
TALIESIN: Checking the door on the right.

671
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:17,430
MATT: Door on the right.

672
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,642
LIAM: Going with.

673
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:29,059
MATT: (creak) Opens up into what was Father
Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're

674
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:38,244
immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And
you can see, shoved under the bed that first

675
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:44,901
appears on the opposite side of the small room,
what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal.

676
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:49,738
Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed.

677
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:51,366
SAM: Can I tell how he died?

678
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:54,328
MATT: You're welcome to go ahead and take a look.
Roll an investigation check.

679
00:48:54,328 --> 00:48:58,533
SAM: 23.

680
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:07,549
MATT: 23. Looking at the body, it appears that
there are a series of puncture wounds.

681
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:14,340
Rapier-based. They're too long, like stiletto, too
long to be a dagger.

682
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,701
SAM: Not teeth.

683
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:22,423
MATT: No, they are inflicted by a weapon, a long
thin weapon. And multiple to the torso.

684
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:26,344
TALIESIN: I'm going to search the room for
anything else. Search the body.

685
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:30,885
MATT: Okay. Searching the body, searching the
room, it looks like everything of interest has

686
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:39,421
been taken from the place. You find some leftover
stale food, you find some candles that are

687
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:45,182
generally used for the purposes of worship here in
the temple, but anything beyond that-- all the

688
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,904
drawers have been emptied, everything has been
taken by whoever was previously setting up

689
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,537
residence in this facility.

690
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:58,554
SAM: Are there any holy symbols or anything that
we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know.

691
00:49:58,554 --> 00:50:01,909
Wasn't she gonna-- I don't know. Do some
holy shit?

692
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:09,272
MATT: You do notice that, throughout the temple,
there are images of Pelor, flame-wreathed face,

693
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:18,397
various sun and stars that are set up, but most of
them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or

694
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:26,135
covered in soot. An intentional effort has been
made to dampen the power of Pelor in this

695
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:27,455
once-holy place.

696
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,777
LIAM: Are there any untouched?

697
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:35,908
MATT: None that are untouched, but there are some
that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small

698
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,877
medallions that are hanging up in the room where
the Father lays.

699
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:40,712
LIAM: I'll snag those.

700
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:41,908
MATT: Okay.

701
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,827
TALIESIN: I want to check the other room. The room
to the left.

702
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,432
MATT: Make a perception check.

703
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:50,308
TALIESIN: So much perception. 19.

704
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:51,526
SAM: 19.

705
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:52,541
LIAM: 20.

706
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,803
MATT: All right. As you walk back into the main
temple--

707
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,296
MARISHA: Finish. First.

708
00:50:56,296 --> 00:51:06,263
MATT: All right. Your ears catch a faint, distant
sound like a strong wind pushing through a

709
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:13,241
mountain pass. This low mournful wail-type sound.

710
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,190
SAM: What's that?

711
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,337
MATT: No wind is moving. There is a stillness to
the air.

712
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:21,143
LIAM: Stepping back into the darkest shadows I can
see.

713
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:34,307
MATT: As you guys take in this sense, this sound
gets louder and louder. At which point, the air

714
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:40,013
itself gets colder and colder. As you nervously
exhale, you can see your breath becoming visible

715
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:44,725
in the air around you. As you all look at each
other, you, stepping back into what shadows there

716
00:51:44,725 --> 00:51:47,236
are, as it is a very open temple, as it's a temple
of sun--

717
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:48,792
LIAM: 32 stealth.

718
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:53,042
MATT: You find what tiny little alcove you can of
shadow. It's not going to offer a lot of

719
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:57,495
protection once you move, but for now
you seem to be out of the circumstance.

720
00:51:57,495 --> 00:52:00,889
SAM: I grab Percy, and I make us both go
invisible.

721
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,188
MATT: Okay.

722
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:05,446
SAM: So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility
spell?

723
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:14,882
MATT: Yeah. You guys both vanish, holding your
place on top of the altar, and as that moaning

724
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:21,977
tends to grow louder and louder you can see this
shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite

725
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:31,116
side of the room. It looks like a woman. A form of
a woman, but translucent in nature, drifting in,

726
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:44,259
giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound, as it
drifts in and you see it looking around and the

727
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:51,167
features are gaunt as it gets closer. It looks
elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just

728
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:58,961
these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair
wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands

729
00:52:58,961 --> 00:53:05,331
reaching out, and as it gets partway through the
temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and

730
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:09,416
its eyes fall directly on you two.

731
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:12,331
LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger right now.

732
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:14,485
MATT: Let's go ahead and--

733
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:16,773
SAM: Ugh! What if she was a good guy?

734
00:53:16,773 --> 00:53:18,278
LIAM: It's a banshee, man.

735
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:29,874
SAM: What if it's a good banshee? Some of the
banshees that I've met have been decent. We're

736
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,020
rolling for initiative?

737
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,260
LIAM: There's Siouxsie and the Banshees, they're
all right.

738
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,151
SAM: I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get
into this goddamn place.

739
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:39,319
MATT: Off to the side there.

740
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:40,747
LIAM: He means well.

741
00:53:40,747 --> 00:53:42,828
TALIESIN: He means well. That's a terrible
costume.

742
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:45,622
MATT: You guys are on the altar there.

743
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:49,254
TALIESIN: You were so prepared for me to go to the
temple that you built it?

744
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:51,966
MATT: I built the whole city, because I didn't
know where you guys were going to go.

745
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:53,258
SAM: Jesus, Matt!

746
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:55,384
MARISHA: He does have a pile of maps over there.

747
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:56,789
MATT Shh! Don't look at it.

748
00:53:56,789 --> 00:53:58,694
TALIESIN: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

749
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:00,427
MARISHA: I'm just noting the pile.

750
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:06,413
MATT: So, first and foremost, let's go ahead and
roll initiative.

751
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,589
LIAM: Okay.

752
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:10,303
MATT: You'll get a surprise round.

753
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:11,324
LIAM: Okay.

754
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:12,400
MARISHA: Dope.

755
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,319
LIAM: Natural 20 for initiative, as well.

756
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,757
MARISHA: You finally got a good initiative roll!

757
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:18,968
SAM: I got a seven.

758
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:27,240
TALIESIN: I got an 11! Together, we can get a
Slurpee. I'm weird tonight.

759
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,006
I don't know what's up.

760
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:30,302
MATT: All right.

761
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:31,779
SAM: Well, I can't do anything.

762
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:39,948
MATT: All right, well. First and foremost, before
anything happens, this entity, as it notices your

763
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:44,516
presence, it begins to transform and its image
becomes more horrifying. As you pull your dagger

764
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:46,801
out, I need all of you guys to roll a wisdom
saving throw.

765
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,207
MARISHA: You have advantage!

766
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:57,877
TALIESIN: I rolled a one and then a natural 20.

767
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,587
MATT: (laughs) Nice.

768
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,994
LIAM: 17.

769
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:01,895
MATT: 17?

770
00:55:01,895 --> 00:55:03,224
TALIESIN: Thank you for the advantage.

771
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:04,510
MARISHA: You're welcome.

772
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,710
MATT: Scanlan?

773
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,823
SAM: 11.

774
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:07,918
MATT: With advantage?

775
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:11,866
SAM: I also always have advantage, so do I get to
roll a third time?

776
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:13,750
LIAM: No. Doesn't stack.

777
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:19,397
MATT: Unfortunately you are considered frightened
by this entity. It scares the crap out of you.

778
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:22,461
MARISHA and TALIESIN: You can't be frightened
after a Heroes' Feast.

779
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:30,274
MATT: Ah! Then never mind. You feel it shake your
form for a second. Its horrible visual presence,

780
00:55:30,274 --> 00:55:34,749
for a second, freaks you out, but then you
remember the knowledge that your friends are here

781
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,228
and you have to serve a purpose and you shake
off--

782
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:41,048
SAM: Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins!

783
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:44,848
MATT: Pull them up and get ready. All right.

784
00:55:44,848 --> 00:55:49,633
MARISHA: Just for a refresher: you're immune to
poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage

785
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,046
on your wisdom throws.

786
00:55:51,046 --> 00:55:52,597
TALIESIN: We should do this every time we fly.

787
00:55:52,597 --> 00:55:54,596
MARISHA: It's expensive.

788
00:55:54,596 --> 00:56:02,638
LIAM: So, do I get to attack and then move into
the combat round where I got a natural 20 plus

789
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:03,903
five for initiative?

790
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:08,944
MATT: Well, you go first. Technically, it's not a
surprise round because the creature can sense life

791
00:56:08,944 --> 00:56:15,597
and saw them before it happens, so it wasn't
ambushed. But you do get to go first, and you do

792
00:56:15,597 --> 00:56:19,599
get to go before it. In the use of surprise, I
didn't mean to use it in the surprise round

793
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,665
fashion. These entities can detect living
creatures up to five miles away.

794
00:56:23,665 --> 00:56:26,604
LIAM: So, there's no sneak attack damage on this
thing, is there?

795
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:29,356
MATT: If you get to it first, you still have
advantage.

796
00:56:29,356 --> 00:56:30,728
LIAM: All right.

797
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:32,751
MATT: Because it doesn't see you. You're still
hidden from it.

798
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:34,513
LIAM: 15, so this is a 26 to hit.

799
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:35,508
MATT: That hits.

800
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:37,901
LIAM: Okay. And this gets the sneak attack
damage?

801
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:39,111
MATT: This would, yes.

802
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:45,227
LIAM: All right, here we go. But it's not a
critical hit from assassinate because--

803
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:46,673
MATT: It is not surprised.

804
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:50,505
LIAM: It's not surprised. All right. So, that's a
four plus seven is 11.

805
00:56:50,505 --> 00:56:58,172
Plus 15, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28?

806
00:56:58,172 --> 00:56:59,505
MATT: Okay.

807
00:56:59,505 --> 00:57:10,183
LIAM: I'm just going to keen dagger it three times
in a row. Oh, I've got to roll to attack, so that

808
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:13,252
is a twelve plus-- 22?

809
00:57:13,323 --> 00:57:14,715
MATT: Hits.

810
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:27,187
LIAM: Okay. Two, and that is six of damage, and
then natural 20 on that one. That is three, four,

811
00:57:27,263 --> 00:57:31,395
three, plus seven is ten, so 20 for that, if it's
doubled for a critical hit.

812
00:57:31,395 --> 00:57:33,338
MATT: For double dice, not doubled modifier.

813
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:37,604
LIAM: Oh, all right, so six plus-- 13.

814
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:43,497
MATT: Okay, 13, good to know. Awesome. So, out of
the shadows, (whoosh) three daggers strike this

815
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:50,336
wailing ghost entity. Each dagger, it punctures,
and you see it reacts from the impact as there's a

816
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:55,278
flash of magical energy with each hit. The daggers
then tumble out of its form and then blink back to

817
00:57:55,278 --> 00:58:00,262
your belt side. It looks like it definitely did
some damage to it, but it's--

818
00:58:00,262 --> 00:58:05,242
LIAM: You know what, just to be fair, I changed
out all my daggers except for one, so I probably

819
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:10,134
couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a
row, so I think should pull back some of the

820
00:58:10,134 --> 00:58:20,550
modifiers, so I would pull out four, because my
dagger is plus two. So the plus two for two

821
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,257
of those hits gets taken out, right?

822
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:23,456
MATT: It would actually, yes.

823
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:24,615
LIAM: So four, minus four.

824
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:26,179
MATT: So, minus four damage to this other guy.

825
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:27,722
TALIESIN: So truthful.

826
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:29,573
SAM: So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes?

827
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:33,159
MATT: Wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two
of the attacks?

828
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,038
LIAM: I threw one dagger and two wooden stakes.

829
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:38,097
MATT: Okay. So, the first dagger hits?

830
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,500
LIAM: First was the dagger, yeah.

831
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:46,711
MATT: Yeah. The two other stakes pass through its
form without any other impact. The one dagger does

832
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:50,025
return to you, but the two stakes just clatter in
the distance, and the creature seems unharmed by

833
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:50,819
those two.

834
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,931
LIAM: Even though they came out of the belt?

835
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:53,157
MATT: Yeah!

836
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:54,032
LIAM: All right.

837
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:54,975
MATT: Sorry.

838
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:56,675
LIAM: It's okay. It's just wood.

839
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:57,549
TALIESIN: You learned.

840
00:58:57,549 --> 00:59:04,276
MATT: So that ends that point. The creature now
swoops up to the center of you three and gives out

841
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:11,630
this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that
bursts out in the air, you feel like the wind push

842
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:17,124
you back and all of you feel like for a moment
you're staring at your own death. I need all three

843
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,969
of you guys to roll constitution saving throws.

844
00:59:19,969 --> 00:59:24,016
SAM: Does our meal help us with that at all?

845
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:25,140
MATT: Nope.

846
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,236
TALIESIN: 11.

847
00:59:26,236 --> 00:59:28,038
MARISHA: Wait, don't forget you have the
additional--

848
00:59:28,038 --> 00:59:29,054
LIAM: What?

849
00:59:29,054 --> 00:59:30,744
MARISHA: 2d10 hit points on top.

850
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:32,295
SAM: Okay. 16.

851
00:59:32,295 --> 00:59:33,912
LIAM: 16.

852
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:42,631
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, you feel this
chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through

853
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:52,500
your soul. And you each take 14 points of psychic
damage. Percy, however, as you look at it, it

854
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,925
seems like this blast actually forces the soul
from your body momentarily. You immediately drop

855
00:59:57,925 --> 00:59:59,545
to zero hit points and are unconscious.

856
00:59:59,545 --> 01:00:04,001
SAM: What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god.

857
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:13,929
MATT: So with that, you see Percy, eyes roll back
and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of

858
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:21,303
cold bones. Out. Percy, it's your turn. Go ahead
and make a death saving throw.

859
01:00:21,303 --> 01:00:22,322
TALIESIN: 11.

860
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:23,592
MATT: 11, okay.

861
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:24,915
MARISHA: That's a good sign.

862
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,079
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

863
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,868
SAM: Very quickly. Should we flee?

864
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:30,518
MARISHA: Get the fuck out.

865
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:31,658
LIAM: In a little bit.

866
01:00:31,658 --> 01:00:33,177
SAM: In a little bit? Okay.

867
01:00:33,177 --> 01:00:34,184
LIAM: Without Percy?

868
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:35,293
MARISHA: Well, get him up.

869
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:38,472
MATT: You still have Bigby's Hand, by the way, on
concentration.

870
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,774
SAM: Oh, that's right!

871
01:00:39,774 --> 01:00:43,805
MATT: Let's see how long that lasts, actually. Let
me see how long it lasts. Just to be safe.

872
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:47,978
TALIESIN: We haven't been there very long.
(whispering) God damn it.

873
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,888
MATT: Up to a minute. So probably would have faded
by now.

874
01:00:51,888 --> 01:00:52,862
SAM: God damn it.

875
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,977
MATT: Sorry. What are you doing, Scanlan?

876
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:58,923
TALIESIN: Really, it's the door's fault.

877
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:07,282
SAM: Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It.
Whatever it is.

878
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:12,417
MATT: Okay. So you release a bolt of lightning
energy right in its direction. Go ahead and roll

879
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:13,577
damage for that.

880
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:14,725
SAM: Oh, just damage?

881
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:17,698
MATT: You don't have to hit for lightning bolt; it
just hits everything in front of it, and you have

882
01:01:17,698 --> 01:01:18,711
to try and avoid it.

883
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:19,631
SAM: Oh, 8d6.

884
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:21,197
MATT: What's the DC?

885
01:01:21,197 --> 01:01:23,379
SAM: Do I get my hand cone?

886
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:28,870
MATT: It is a free action to pull it out, so you
instinctively-- hand cone, cast the spell-- out

887
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:29,894
the bolt goes.

888
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:30,701
SAM: So, 19.

889
01:01:30,701 --> 01:01:31,869
MATT: 19, okay.

890
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:33,086
SAM: 8d6.

891
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:34,453
MATT: Does not make its saving throw.

892
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:35,338
SAM: Great.

893
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,794
TALIESIN: Need more d6, or are you cool?

894
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,721
SAM: Nope, that's it. I just need help counting.

895
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:40,752
MARISHA: That's good!

896
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:46,497
SAM: 16, five, 21, 27.

897
01:01:46,497 --> 01:01:49,373
TALIESIN: 28, 29, 30. 34!

898
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:50,564
SAM: 34.

899
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:55,728
MATT: 34 points of damage. The lightning blasts
through her, not impactful as you think it might

900
01:01:55,728 --> 01:02:01,116
be. This entity because it is in an ethereal
state, is not as effectively hit by such magics.

901
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:02,423
However, it does take damage.

902
01:02:02,423 --> 01:02:03,649
SAM: Okay.

903
01:02:03,649 --> 01:02:04,935
MATT: Okay.

904
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:18,152
SAM: I will move back a bit. Away from the thing.
And I will-- Oh! We have people.

905
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:22,239
MARISHA: Yay! Percy's unconscious!

906
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,428
LAURA: No!

907
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:24,783
TRAVIS: Keep fighting!

908
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,997
MARISHA: It's okay, it's cool.

909
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:27,326
LAURA: We've been listening in the car.

910
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,723
TALIESIN: Okay, so you know.

911
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:30,146
MATT: Scanlan, you move back?

912
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,386
SAM: Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action,
still get a bonus?

913
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:35,578
I will heal him, this doofus here.

914
01:02:35,578 --> 01:02:37,124
TALIESIN: I didn't do anything!

915
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:38,868
MATT: Healing Word.

916
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:45,464
SAM: Okay, yeah. (singing) I'm bring health points
back. Yeah! You mothafuckas don't know how to

917
01:02:45,464 --> 01:02:49,087
act-- Yeah! That's all I got. (singing) Take it to
the bridge!

918
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,213
MATT: All right, so Healing Word is 1d4 plus--

919
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:55,183
SAM: Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a--

920
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:56,626
TALIESIN: Just get me up. It's okay.

921
01:02:56,626 --> 01:02:59,308
SAM: Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something?

922
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,277
MARISHA: Do it.

923
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:04,000
SAM: Two plus whatever. Six? Eight?

924
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,228
MARISHA: I think it's plus your spell level.

925
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,312
MATT: Healing Word will be--

926
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:10,577
SAM: It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points.

927
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:14,216
MATT: So, seven hit points. You're conscious, but
you're still on the ground, face down, loosely

928
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:17,950
fallen over the stuff on the altar.

929
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,520
TALIESIN: I don't get my turn until next round.

930
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,195
MATT: Correct. So, Scanlan? Your turn's done? Vax,
you're up.

931
01:03:24,195 --> 01:03:30,687
LIAM: All right, so where is it? I'm just going to
back away from it about three steps, while I pull

932
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:33,509
Flametongue Dagger out of my cloak.

933
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,428
MATT: Okay. You're in this room currently.

934
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:39,979
LIAM: Yeah, oh! That, oh, okay. No. So, I'm going
to walk, thanks. I'm going to slide up the wall

935
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:46,403
along where Scanlan is. Towards Scanlan. And
another thing I realized, I haven't clicked my

936
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:50,191
Boots of Haste, so I wouldn't have been able to do
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, anyway. And I'm still not

937
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:54,803
going to. But I'm pulling out my Flametongue
Dagger and now I'm throwing Keen Dagger,

938
01:03:54,803 --> 01:04:00,200
Flametongue. First one is 26.

939
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,240
MATT: Hits.

940
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,443
LIAM: And the second one is 23.

941
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:04,401
MATT: Hits.

942
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:09,014
LIAM: Okay. First attack gets 11.

943
01:04:09,014 --> 01:04:10,393
MATT: All right.

944
01:04:10,393 --> 01:04:13,324
LIAM: And the second attack gets eight.

945
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:20,803
MATT: All righty. Both daggers hitting it, you see
its form being impacted by each dagger hit. It

946
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:25,004
still continues to come forward toward the two of
you. Is that the end of your movement?

947
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:29,623
LIAM: I'm going to, without doing any dash or
anything, because I can't, I'm going to move as

948
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:33,898
far as I can just going kitty-corner. Behind
Scanlan, walking along the wall.

949
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:34,807
MATT: Over here?

950
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:35,911
LIAM: Absolutely.

951
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:36,860
MATT: That far?

952
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,954
LIAM: Yeah, that's as far as I can get, that's
good.

953
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:46,313
MATT: I think so. All right. That ends your turn.
The creature now is going to drift up to the

954
01:04:46,313 --> 01:04:52,293
unconscious form, or the now-conscious form of
Percy. It's going to swipe at you with its

955
01:04:52,293 --> 01:05:00,447
Corrupting Touch. Since you're prone, it has
advantage on the attack. That'll be 20 to hit.

956
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:01,774
What's your AC?

957
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:02,713
TALIESIN: 18.

958
01:05:02,713 --> 01:05:08,108
MATT: 18? Okay. As its hand reaches down and
passes through, as you just come to consciousness,

959
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:12,111
and you start getting yourself up, you look up
and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches

960
01:05:12,184 --> 01:05:15,664
through your back and seems to almost grasp your
spine. Your whole body lurches from the impact.

961
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:17,991
You take 12 points of necrotic damage.

962
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:19,744
TALIESIN: I'm back to zero.

963
01:05:19,744 --> 01:05:21,138
SAM: That's two!

964
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:23,102
LIAM: It starts over.

965
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:24,068
SAM: It does?

966
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:25,625
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm back to zero.

967
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:29,344
SAM: If he dies once, comes back and dies again,
is that two?

968
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:31,399
MATT: No, he has to fail his death saves.

969
01:05:31,399 --> 01:05:37,369
TALIESIN: I just woke up and went, (groans). Passed
back out again.

970
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:42,097
MATT: That ends its turn. Well, no actually, it's
going to start moving now. It's going to drift

971
01:05:42,097 --> 01:05:49,518
through the rest of its movement this direction.
That ends its turn. Go ahead and make your death

972
01:05:49,518 --> 01:05:50,978
saving throw.

973
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:53,001
TALIESIN: Yes, 19.

974
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:54,085
LAURA: Yeah.

975
01:05:54,085 --> 01:05:55,785
TRAVIS: Yay, little snitch.

976
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,279
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

977
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:01,828
SAM: Hey, should we leave?

978
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:05,240
LIAM: No, we should kill this thing!

979
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,430
SAM: Damn it! All right.

980
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,930
LIAM: We're not going to be able to run. This
thing flew in here on the breeze.

981
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:16,729
SAM: I don't think Eyebite's going to work against
it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand

982
01:06:16,729 --> 01:06:18,119
at 6th-level, then.

983
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,707
MATT: (laughing) Okay!

984
01:06:20,707 --> 01:06:21,960
TRAVIS: Has that ever been done?

985
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,711
SAM: I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So,
I'm just going to make it even bigger.

986
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:26,732
MATT: All righty.

987
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,830
SAM: I don't even know what it does.

988
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:34,618
LIAM: Fingers going out the windows of the church
like Alice in Wonderland.

989
01:06:34,618 --> 01:06:42,950
MATT: All right. Bigby's Hand. With a clenched
fist deals an additional 2d8 damage.

990
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:43,988
SAM: Okay.

991
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:46,669
MATT: So if you're going to punch it, it does an
additional 2d8 damage.

992
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,552
SAM: Yes, I think--

993
01:06:48,552 --> 01:06:50,480
MATT: What are you going to do?

994
01:06:50,480 --> 01:07:00,162
SAM: I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful
hand. So I can just push it far away from us.

995
01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:01,771
Possibly to the front door.

996
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:04,924
MATT: Okay, I see. So it does no damage but it
does force its movement.

997
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:05,845
SAM: Yeah.

998
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:13,781
MATT: Okay, and I'll say because you did it at a
higher level, it's an additional five feet of

999
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:16,852
movement on that. So, as the hand shoves toward
the creature--

1000
01:07:16,852 --> 01:07:18,540
SAM: It takes no damage for that?

1001
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:23,852
MATT: The forceful hand it doesn't, no. There's
grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage.

1002
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:25,724
SAM: All right, so then I'll just hit it. I'll
just hit it hard.

1003
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:30,392
MATT: Okay. So, you bitch-slap it physically hard.
Clenched fist. Go ahead and make a spell attack.

1004
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:32,757
Go ahead and roll a d20, add your spell attack
modifier.

1005
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:38,525
SAM: 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus
nine.

1006
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:43,832
MATT: 14 plus nine? That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage. That's 6d8 force damage because you cast

1007
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,124
it at 6th level.

1008
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:50,310
SAM: 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's
a ten.

1009
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,417
LIAM: They look like diamonds.

1010
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:54,234
SAM: There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it
six times.

1011
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,887
TRAVIS: (singing) Diamonds are Scanlan's best
friend.

1012
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:59,226
LAURA: No, diamonds are Vex's best friend.

1013
01:07:59,226 --> 01:08:03,666
SAM: 24?

1014
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:04,989
MATT: 24.

1015
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:06,530
SAM: Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.

1016
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:13,880
MATT: Yeah. As that happens, the fist clenches and
(wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost

1017
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,674
creature. As it does you hear it scream out in
pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered

1018
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:21,593
across the air and dissipates.

1019
01:08:21,593 --> 01:08:24,051
SAM: What?

1020
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:25,152
MARISHA: Thank god.

1021
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:26,090
SAM: What?

1022
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,047
TRAVIS: I think you smashed it.

1023
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:27,867
MARISHA: You killed it.

1024
01:08:27,867 --> 01:08:28,774
LIAM: You crushed it.

1025
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:30,234
SAM: But I'm so little and wee!

1026
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:33,082
LIAM: Lift yourself up for a victory lap.

1027
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:38,780
SAM: Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand.
Yeah, that was a great idea.

1028
01:08:38,831 --> 01:08:40,468
MATT: You toss yourself up a couple times.

1029
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:45,049
SAM: Whoa!

1030
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:46,423
TRAVIS: Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious.

1031
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:47,859
SAM: Oh shit! Percy!

1032
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:56,485
LIAM: No, I've got four healing potions. I pour,
it's not the best. It's a greater healing?

1033
01:08:56,485 --> 01:09:00,458
MATT: So, it's 4d4 plus four.

1034
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:04,213
SAM: I will also sing for him a Song of Rest,
which is just another d6.

1035
01:09:04,213 --> 01:09:05,840
MATT: If you guys are taking a short rest--

1036
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,706
SAM: Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger?

1037
01:09:08,706 --> 01:09:11,695
LIAM: We don't know, but I poured the potion into
Percy's mouth.

1038
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:12,773
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four?

1039
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:13,694
MATT: Yep, you got it.

1040
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:25,687
TALIESIN: Four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, 14.
Yep. I'm awake. Hurt, but--

1041
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:28,895
LIAM: I slap him twice, anyway.

1042
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:30,787
TALIESIN: Ugh! Ah!

1043
01:09:30,787 --> 01:09:31,961
LIAM: What do we do?

1044
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:33,056
SAM: What are we doing here?

1045
01:09:33,056 --> 01:09:35,462
LIAM: The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or
should we head back?

1046
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:41,115
TALIESIN: We should head back. Apparently, any
help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone.

1047
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:43,522
SAM: Should we check this other room first, before
we go?

1048
01:09:43,522 --> 01:09:44,867
TALIESIN: Did we not check the other room?

1049
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:45,716
SAM and LIAM: No.

1050
01:09:45,716 --> 01:09:46,732
TALIESIN: Let's check the other room, and--

1051
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:47,677
SAM: Quickly, though, quickly.

1052
01:09:47,677 --> 01:09:48,641
TALIESIN: We'll check the other room quickly.

1053
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:52,806
LIAM: While they check the room, I'm going to go
all over the altar and see if there's anything,

1054
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:55,932
any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like
that.

1055
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:57,370
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

1056
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:04,549
LIAM: Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep
forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.

1057
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:08,386
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you missed that
part.

1058
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:15,032
MATT: Looking over the altar, it appears to be
smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your

1059
01:10:15,032 --> 01:10:24,024
attention. You check the other room. This is a
small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was

1060
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:30,700
running here would make small meals or things to
delineate during worship and/or just cook for its

1061
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,836
own meals when the father was keeping--

1062
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:35,307
TALIESIN: Has it been used recently? Is it--

1063
01:10:35,307 --> 01:10:39,907
MATT: It does not appear to have been used, you
can make an investigation check to gather an idea

1064
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,088
of how long it's been there.

1065
01:10:41,088 --> 01:10:43,247
SAM I'm going to look around as well and food and
stuff.

1066
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:44,226
TALIESIN: 12.

1067
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:45,193
SAM: 22.

1068
01:10:45,193 --> 01:10:51,589
MATT: Okay. You get the feeling that the last time
this was used was a little under a week ago.

1069
01:10:51,589 --> 01:10:53,150
TALIESIN: All right.

1070
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,574
SAM: Any provisions that we can take? Water,
food?

1071
01:10:56,574 --> 01:11:03,002
MATT: You find a couple of loaves of stale bread,
some dried meats, salted dry meats, like

1072
01:11:03,002 --> 01:11:07,764
some jerky-ish type things. Things that are meant
to last a while. There is produce here, but the

1073
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:10,242
produce has long wilted and gone to rot.

1074
01:11:10,242 --> 01:11:15,225
TALIESIN: I have theories on who's been using this
space. Is there anything that would clue me in to

1075
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:16,522
who's been using this space?

1076
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:24,580
MATT: It's hard to really tell. You're not too
familiar with lifestyles of different individuals.

1077
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:31,589
Whoever left the notes, and whoever was dabbling
with the vicinity does have a tendency towards

1078
01:11:31,589 --> 01:11:41,837
sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can
blend and overlap with your specialty. That's the

1079
01:11:41,837 --> 01:11:44,016
best you can ascertain, based on the information
given.

1080
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:47,944
TALIESIN: Now, here's the question. Do we leave
them a sign that we're here, or do we hope that

1081
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:49,646
they don't notice?

1082
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:56,086
SAM: Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed
to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a

1083
01:11:56,086 --> 01:12:00,892
sign that someone was here and fucked up their
shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar?

1084
01:12:00,892 --> 01:12:01,903
TALIESIN: No.

1085
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:06,962
LIAM: I take my dagger, and I go to the altar--

1086
01:12:06,962 --> 01:12:08,117
TALIESIN: Wait.

1087
01:12:08,117 --> 01:12:09,972
SAM: No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only
one left.

1088
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:13,321
LIAM: I didn't say I'm leaving it. Yeah. You want
that?

1089
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:14,232
TALIESIN: I want that.

1090
01:12:14,232 --> 01:12:17,951
LIAM: I start-- would you hand me that scrap of
paper, yeah?

1091
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:19,479
SAM: Whoa, this is our sign?

1092
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:25,936
LIAM: So I start carving this-- Is this Pelor?

1093
01:12:25,936 --> 01:12:32,732
TALIESIN: This is not Pelor. It's part of the
crest of de Rolo.

1094
01:12:32,732 --> 01:12:34,292
LAURA: Ooh!

1095
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:36,745
MARISHA: de Rolos are back!

1096
01:12:36,745 --> 01:12:40,825
LIAM: Okay. So, I just start scraping it into the
stone with the Keen Dagger.

1097
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:46,052
MATT: Okay. And it gives a horrible screeching
sound as you carve into this well-polished stone

1098
01:12:46,222 --> 01:12:51,656
surface that's used predominantly for worship, or
when it was. Given about five, ten minutes in you

1099
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:56,983
manage to scrape a design into it that is visually
distinct against the smooth surface, and does

1100
01:12:56,983 --> 01:12:59,058
match the design best to your ability that
Percy--

1101
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:04,360
TALIESIN: I would also like to drag Father Reynal
out of his room and put him at the pedestal.

1102
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,721
MATT: Okay.

1103
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:14,925
LIAM: And then before we go, I'm going to the
wooden door, and I carve into the door: Pelor

1104
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:18,410
lives in Whitestone.

1105
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,827
SAM: That's a lot of words.

1106
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:22,328
MARISHA: Six hours later...

1107
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:24,691
LIAM: It's wood! It took me five minutes.

1108
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:33,954
MATT: Okay. You finish your carving, seemingly
without recurring incident.

1109
01:13:33,954 --> 01:13:37,379
TALIESIN: Like to head back now, I believe.

1110
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:41,193
MATT: Yeah. You guys make your way out of the
temple back into the center of the graveyard. The

1111
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:47,855
sun is beginning to set. The reds and purples of
the night sky are starting to creep in, as it just

1112
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:52,703
begins to crest on the far western side of the
mountain range surrounding the valley.

1113
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:54,016
MARISHA: I have a question.

1114
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:54,818
MATT Yes.

1115
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:59,174
MARISHA: What's the weather been like since we've
been in Whitestone?

1116
01:13:59,174 --> 01:14:00,949
MATT: It's been spotty, cloudy--

1117
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:04,434
MARISHA: The sun has come out during the daytime?

1118
01:14:04,434 --> 01:14:10,231
MATT: Bits and pieces. There is heavy cloud cover
that seems to be pushing through. It brings colder

1119
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:13,888
weather. It looks like when you first got there,
there was some snowfall that happened before you

1120
01:14:13,888 --> 01:14:20,725
arrived. You've had a few days of sun, but I'd say
about half the day is cloud cover.

1121
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:26,240
MARISHA: Does it seem to be fairly natural weather
for this time of year? Okay.

1122
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,041
MATT: And this far north, too. All right. You
guys--

1123
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:34,343
LIAM: I also grab those wooden stakes off the
ground.

1124
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:39,636
MATT: Okay. Takes you a little time, because
they're amongst a bunch of other

1125
01:14:39,636 --> 01:14:40,902
broken wooden scraps--

1126
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,200
LIAM: I grab a couple extra, as well.

1127
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:47,004
MATT: Okay! You find some splintered wood. You
guys make your way back into the town. I'd like

1128
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:50,398
you all to make a stealth, or a deception check,
if you prefer.

1129
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:53,816
SAM: Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a
peasant boy.

1130
01:14:53,816 --> 01:14:56,024
TALIESIN: 13.

1131
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,998
MATT: 13.

1132
01:14:57,998 --> 01:14:59,291
TRAVIS: G'day sir.

1133
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,414
LIAM: 23.

1134
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:01,235
MATT: Okay.

1135
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:02,190
SAM: 32.

1136
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:13,568
MATT: All right. As you guys are making your way
back towards the tavern, there is a small group of

1137
01:15:13,568 --> 01:15:21,321
Whitestone villagers walking and having a
conversation. Not heated, but there is a sense of

1138
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:29,557
desperate conversation amongst them. And, standing
with them you can see there's an older gentleman,

1139
01:15:29,557 --> 01:15:37,158
mostly bald, long scraggly gray hair that falls
past his shoulders, a little bit hunched. He's

1140
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:43,599
wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one
shoulder and drags the ground behind him. And

1141
01:15:43,599 --> 01:15:48,518
they're talking to him and he's growling to
himself and the best you can make out is there's

1142
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:57,160
an argument about farming shipments and the
inability to make dates and requirements. He

1143
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:05,372
shouts back to the remainder, says, "Listen, it is
beyond my control. This is what has been decreed

1144
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:10,358
"by Sir Kerrion. That is how it'll be. If you
cannot provide, then taxes will be pulled. If you

1145
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:18,589
"cannot pay, then there are far worse things we can
take. Now, be on your way!" And steps away from

1146
01:16:18,589 --> 01:16:28,479
the group, looks over and sees a little boy and this
in the shadows skulking individual. "You there!"

1147
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:30,389
TALIESIN: Yes?

1148
01:16:30,389 --> 01:16:32,472
MATT: "You new around here?"

1149
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:34,034
TALIESIN: A bit, yes.

1150
01:16:34,034 --> 01:16:38,079
MATT: "I don't recognize you." And two of the
guards step forward.

1151
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:41,308
TALIESIN: I suppose it's our good luck, then.

1152
01:16:41,308 --> 01:16:43,833
MATT: "What's your name?"

1153
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:47,095
TALIESIN: (sighs) Reggie.

1154
01:16:47,095 --> 01:16:48,880
MATT: Make a deception check.

1155
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,346
TALIESIN: Fuck my life. I know! 21!

1156
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:57,245
LIAM: My name's Reggie.

1157
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:03,234
MATT: "Then make yourself useful. Maybe you can
make up for some of these lost crops that these

1158
01:17:03,234 --> 01:17:05,925
"bags of shite keep saying they can't do."

1159
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:08,203
TALIESIN: I'm actually supposed to be going back
for a--

1160
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:10,799
MATT: "I don't give a shit, move on, boy."

1161
01:17:10,799 --> 01:17:12,424
TALIESIN: Yes, sir.

1162
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:18,760
MATT: He grumbles and keeps on walking. The guards
give you a look. One of them spits at your foot,

1163
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:26,189
keeps walking on. Eventually, they drift aside.
You continue your path back to the tavern where

1164
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:30,733
the rest of you are waiting. The sun has now set.
Night has taken the sky and Keyleth is on the

1165
01:17:30,733 --> 01:17:32,929
verge of completing her ritual.

1166
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:36,275
LAURA: I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her.

1167
01:17:36,275 --> 01:17:43,644
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye from the second
floor. I want to see how much movement in the city

1168
01:17:43,644 --> 01:17:50,039
there is and whether or not there's any guards by
the tree, whether or not the tree seems to be left

1169
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,454
to its own devices.

1170
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:59,885
MATT: Okay. As you're keeping watch, you notice
occasionally there will be one of the zombie

1171
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:05,857
giants that will lumber through the center of
town. There's a very specific pattern that they

1172
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:07,193
tend to follow.

1173
01:18:07,193 --> 01:18:09,994
TALIESIN: Definitely trying to memorize that.

1174
01:18:09,994 --> 01:18:14,510
MATT: And you do notice a couple of other guards
that you didn't notice during the day begin to

1175
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:21,876
show up. They're humanoid; they're armored. They
sneak around. They're humanoid, but their movement

1176
01:18:21,876 --> 01:18:23,421
is unnatural.

1177
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:26,626
TALIESIN: Is there a lot of light in the town, or
not very much light?

1178
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:33,070
MATT: Not very much light at all. There's very
low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been

1179
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:36,378
left up for general visibility for those who have
to travel at night, but you gather most people

1180
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,357
just do not travel at night here in Whitestone.

1181
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:41,590
LAURA: Make sure no lights are lit in our--

1182
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,818
TALIESIN: We've already blacked out--

1183
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,206
SAM: I blacked out the windows.

1184
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:45,104
LAURA: Okay.

1185
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:46,618
MATT: Keyleth--

1186
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:47,650
MARISHA: Yeah?

1187
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:51,509
MATT: You finally complete your ritual. Sweat
pouring down your brow,

1188
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:53,957
you have your hand on the roots--

1189
01:18:53,957 --> 01:19:06,466
MARISHA: Can I do something? Something real quick
for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the

1190
01:19:06,466 --> 01:19:19,839
ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun
tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell

1191
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:27,128
as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last
big essence--

1192
01:19:27,128 --> 01:19:28,479
SAM: At night?

1193
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:37,025
MARISHA: I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my
Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness.

1194
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:41,294
And shove it in the tree.

1195
01:19:41,378 --> 01:19:44,693
TALIESIN: You're going to shove it where the sun
don't shine.

1196
01:19:44,693 --> 01:19:50,393
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know
if it's going to work or not.

1197
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:55,252
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom
modifier.

1198
01:19:55,252 --> 01:19:59,254
MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this? Because of
Heroes' Feast?

1199
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:05,073
MATT: I would say no, because this isn't a saving
throw and because what you're attempting to do is

1200
01:20:05,073 --> 01:20:11,354
essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a
non-damaging circumstance at the end of an

1201
01:20:11,354 --> 01:20:16,289
eight-hour endurance match with a ritual. This is
going to be a difficult attempt. So go ahead and

1202
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:18,803
roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier.

1203
01:20:18,803 --> 01:20:20,783
MARISHA: I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing
this.

1204
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,172
LAURA: You got it, Keyleth.

1205
01:20:22,172 --> 01:20:24,649
TRAVIS: Yeah, you never get arrested or anything,
you're good.

1206
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:27,736
SAM: Use the green one. This is you doing
greenery.

1207
01:20:27,736 --> 01:20:30,494
MARISHA: I'm so nervous.

1208
01:20:30,494 --> 01:20:36,118
SAM: Natural 20. Easy. Or a six.

1209
01:20:36,187 --> 01:20:37,099
LAURA: Oh, no.

1210
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:39,133
MARISHA: But my wisdom's not bad, so 12?

1211
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:49,774
MATT: You complete the ritual and release the
healing energy of your Plant Growth spell. As you

1212
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:54,236
release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray
and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of

1213
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:59,739
earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate
and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to

1214
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:04,656
pierce out from parts of the earth in your
immediate vicinity, as this affects a large

1215
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:17,635
radius. There does not appear to be any sort of
immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull

1216
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:30,210
back and concentrate on the spell. You release the
Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of

1217
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:37,611
reaction from the tree and the desperation to make
sure some effect happens, you release the full

1218
01:21:37,611 --> 01:21:42,953
force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect
and you burst into some of the roots, blasting

1219
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:46,669
some of them apart and beginning to set flame to
part of the under of the tree.

1220
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:50,045
MARISHA: Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story.

1221
01:21:50,045 --> 01:21:51,295
LIAM: Bucket of water.

1222
01:21:51,295 --> 01:21:55,026
MARISHA: I'll put it out.

1223
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:56,519
MATT: You guys hear this (explosion).

1224
01:21:56,519 --> 01:22:01,349
LAURA: That's right in front of-- I pull out my
cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the

1225
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:06,282
flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to
happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I

1226
01:22:06,282 --> 01:22:09,883
stop? I keep putting out the flames.

1227
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:21,264
MATT: You put out the flames. And you notice where
the fire had burned aspects of the wood, there is

1228
01:22:21,264 --> 01:22:28,150
the black char marks across the roots where the
flames touched, and the area surrounding the root

1229
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:35,282
is a little more of a vibrant brown color. Almost
like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped

1230
01:22:35,282 --> 01:22:36,941
into the root.

1231
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:38,262
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1232
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:42,158
MATT: It expands for a moment and you can see a
little bit of life return to that localized

1233
01:22:42,187 --> 01:22:43,562
section of the tree.

1234
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:53,916
MARISHA: Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air)
Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!

1235
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:59,994
MATT: As you do, there's still these bits of ivy
greenery, this long-embedded seeds through years

1236
01:22:59,994 --> 01:23:04,633
and years and generations of earth layering in
here. These long-dormant seeds are starting to

1237
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:12,344
come to life and spring through the earth around
you. The expansion of the healthier portion of the

1238
01:23:12,344 --> 01:23:18,829
root begins to spread, and then stop spreading.
And you begin to notice all the greenery

1239
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:26,366
begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn
to ash. And you watch as the vibrant aspect of the

1240
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:31,512
roots slowly drain from the bottom up. Like
something is pulling the

1241
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:33,355
life force out of the roots.

1242
01:23:33,355 --> 01:23:36,338
LAURA: They're sucking the life force out of the
earth.

1243
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:44,059
MARISHA: I take some of that holy oil that Vax
gave me and I dip my finger in it and start

1244
01:23:44,059 --> 01:23:48,030
rubbing it along the vines that are growing along
the edge of the roots.

1245
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:53,412
MATT: You take the holy oil and place it along the
roots, and it soaks into the dry and in some cases

1246
01:23:53,412 --> 01:24:04,831
now charred aspects of the roots. You wait a
moment, and the oil seems to almost burn off and

1247
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:06,054
evaporate.

1248
01:24:06,054 --> 01:24:07,875
SAM: So, the ground is cursed.

1249
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,860
MARISHA: The ground is cursed.

1250
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:13,250
SAM: Well, poo.

1251
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,253
TRAVIS: Should I try peeing on it?

1252
01:24:15,253 --> 01:24:16,435
MATT: Make a perception check.

1253
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:17,915
MARISHA: Perception check?

1254
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:20,710
TALIESIN: That thing you hate doing?

1255
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:24,168
MARISHA: No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm
just not good at reading people.

1256
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:25,528
SAM: You know what we need to do?

1257
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:28,236
MARISHA: That's not bad. 23?

1258
01:24:28,236 --> 01:24:32,151
SAM: Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above.

1259
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:41,144
MATT: The pattern of decay that followed your
initial attempt at reviving this vicinity, all had

1260
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:50,252
a very distinct downward motion of draining. There
was something about the ground, something beneath

1261
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:55,118
the tree and where you are that is seemingly
taking the life force of the surroundings.

1262
01:24:55,118 --> 01:24:59,055
LAURA: Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is
right underneath us?

1263
01:24:59,055 --> 01:25:03,413
MARISHA: I was going to say, can I still see the
green being sucked down a bit?

1264
01:25:03,413 --> 01:25:07,866
MATT: At this point, all the life force was very
quickly drained.

1265
01:25:07,866 --> 01:25:18,809
LAURA: Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense
any sort of vampiric presence within our very

1266
01:25:18,809 --> 01:25:20,067
close vicinity?

1267
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:22,828
MATT: What's the radius on that?

1268
01:25:22,828 --> 01:25:28,792
LAURA: It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I
spend six minutes.

1269
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:35,244
MATT: Okay. So you take your time, and you begin
to focus and it expands. As you do, focusing on

1270
01:25:35,244 --> 01:25:53,008
vampiric presence, you feel a fair amount of
presence: above, below and further north. And

1271
01:25:53,008 --> 01:26:01,410
smattered throughout the city. You get the
sensation at this point in time that there is much

1272
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:08,502
more beyond just Lord Briarwood that have come to
be a creature of the night in this city.

1273
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:15,488
LAURA: (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably
bad.

1274
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:20,826
TRAVIS: Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe
it's just the soil.

1275
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:22,708
TALIESIN: The ground is tainted.

1276
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,791
MARISHA: I'm exhausted.

1277
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:26,203
SAM and TALIESIN: Let's sleep.

1278
01:26:26,203 --> 01:26:31,568
LAURA: We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by
vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by

1279
01:26:31,568 --> 01:26:33,340
lots and lots of vampires?

1280
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,367
TALIESIN: I'm going to tinker for a moment on my
glove with that thing I talked about.

1281
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:42,075
MATT: Okay. Make an intelligence check.

1282
01:26:42,075 --> 01:26:43,961
TALIESIN: An intelligence check?

1283
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:46,474
MATT: Yeah, just a straight intelligence check.

1284
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:47,904
TALIESIN: 14.

1285
01:26:47,904 --> 01:27:00,107
MATT: 14. Incorporating this organic organ?
Keeping it from rotting is already going to be a

1286
01:27:00,107 --> 01:27:04,716
feat. In order to incorporate any of its natural
charge essence is going to require your workshop.

1287
01:27:04,716 --> 01:27:08,047
Doing that on the go is too intricate.

1288
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:10,444
TALIESIN: I just wanted to think about it. It's
fine.

1289
01:27:10,444 --> 01:27:14,257
MATT: I mean, it may be functional. It's
definitely possible to use what you extracted from

1290
01:27:14,257 --> 01:27:21,184
the behir to be a way to charge your Diplomacy,
but that is something that you'll have to do in a

1291
01:27:21,184 --> 01:27:25,351
controlled space when you have everything at your
disposal. It's a very delicate process to even

1292
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:26,484
attempt it.

1293
01:27:26,484 --> 01:27:28,884
TALIESIN: I think we get it.

1294
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:30,344
LIAM: I'll take first watch.

1295
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:34,165
MATT: Okay. You all take an evening's rest.

1296
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:36,064
MARISHA: I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you
guys.

1297
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:38,111
TALIESIN: We learned a lot.

1298
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:42,746
LAURA: You even did that awesome fire thing at the
end that was really, really cool.

1299
01:27:42,746 --> 01:27:46,124
MARISHA: Thanks. I was afraid I was going to
permanently kill it for a second.

1300
01:27:46,124 --> 01:27:49,651
TALIESIN: We know it's not <i>dead</i> dead. That it's
just tainted.

1301
01:27:49,651 --> 01:27:53,697
SAM: Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door
and a banshee, so--

1302
01:27:53,697 --> 01:27:55,490
LAURA: Really?

1303
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:57,064
SAM: Yeah.

1304
01:27:57,064 --> 01:27:58,369
LAURA: Nice, Scanlan.

1305
01:27:58,369 --> 01:28:00,629
SAM: The door was harder to kill.

1306
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:04,014
TRAVIS: That's some door!

1307
01:28:04,014 --> 01:28:07,928
TALIESIN: It's okay. I think I figured out what we
have to do first.

1308
01:28:07,928 --> 01:28:09,816
MARISHA: What do we have to do first?

1309
01:28:09,816 --> 01:28:14,581
TALIESIN: I think we have to kill Kerrion
Stonefell.

1310
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,787
SAM: Who's that?

1311
01:28:15,787 --> 01:28:20,523
TALIESIN: It's the one that everyone-- he's the
one managing all of the goods and all of the

1312
01:28:20,523 --> 01:28:21,594
farming.

1313
01:28:21,594 --> 01:28:24,297
SAM: Is that who they were talking about today?
The group?

1314
01:28:24,297 --> 01:28:26,828
LAURA: Where is he at?

1315
01:28:26,845 --> 01:28:29,464
SAM: Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said
something else.

1316
01:28:29,464 --> 01:28:35,232
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell. He's in one of the
three-- I would assume that he's been given one of

1317
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:37,085
the three mansions in town.

1318
01:28:37,163 --> 01:28:41,575
SAM: You think if we find him, kill him, and leave
his body on some sort of public display, it would

1319
01:28:41,575 --> 01:28:44,782
sow some seeds of rebellion?

1320
01:28:44,782 --> 01:28:48,435
TALIESIN: I think it would be the beginning. He's
who everybody's afraid of.

1321
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:49,888
TRAVIS: We could hang him in the tree.

1322
01:28:49,888 --> 01:28:51,303
TALIESIN: We could hang him in the tree.

1323
01:28:51,303 --> 01:28:53,610
SAM: We could. Grog, could you do something nasty
to his body?

1324
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:54,962
TRAVIS: Just say the word.

1325
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,368
LAURA: Oh, this is messed up.

1326
01:28:56,368 --> 01:28:58,617
SAM: All right.

1327
01:28:58,617 --> 01:29:00,347
TRAVIS: Do we check the mansions for him?

1328
01:29:00,347 --> 01:29:04,678
TALIESIN: I think we ask around to see if there's
a way to ask around to find out

1329
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,156
who's in what house.

1330
01:29:06,156 --> 01:29:09,535
SAM: Ask around? Let's just go house to house and
kill everyone in all of them!

1331
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:13,147
TALIESIN: Let's-- Eventually, yes.

1332
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:17,960
TRAVIS: Hello. I'd like to share the news of our
Lord and Savior: my axe in your face!

1333
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,988
SAM: Yes. We could be Mormons.

1334
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:28,282
MATT: As you guys take your watches and go to
sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold

1335
01:29:28,282 --> 01:29:31,102
interior of the tavern. As the night comes
through, this is your first time really staying

1336
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:38,959
the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though
you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the

1337
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:44,489
trees itself, the temperature grows far colder
here, and even with the warm interior, the windows

1338
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:49,220
frost over and you find yourselves having to
huddle or build some sort of small fire to even

1339
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:54,036
keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all
eventually go to sleep throughout your various

1340
01:29:54,036 --> 01:29:59,251
times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom
saving throw. With advantage, because you're still

1341
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:00,739
affected by the Heroes' Feast.

1342
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:02,145
SAM: Until noon tomorrow, right?

1343
01:30:02,145 --> 01:30:03,332
MARISHA: 2PM tomorrow.

1344
01:30:03,332 --> 01:30:06,046
SAM: Yeah!

1345
01:30:06,088 --> 01:30:07,710
TALIESIN: 12.

1346
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,208
SAM: 17.

1347
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,078
MARISHA: 25.

1348
01:30:12,078 --> 01:30:12,965
LIAM: 20.

1349
01:30:12,965 --> 01:30:13,848
LAURA: 23.

1350
01:30:13,848 --> 01:30:15,170
TRAVIS: 14.

1351
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:24,306
MATT: Okay. All of you wake the next morning
rested as best as can be. Percy, your entire

1352
01:30:26,225 --> 01:30:30,270
evening was wracked with nightmare after
nightmare, imagery you wish to not recall.

1353
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:38,027
Whispers and voices familiar, unfamiliar, seeing
yourself pulled from your physical self into the

1354
01:30:38,027 --> 01:30:44,548
heart of this banshee, then wrest from death,
barely, cackling in the distance. I want you to go

1355
01:30:44,548 --> 01:30:47,915
ahead and mark on your sheet one point of
corruption.

1356
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:49,255
LAURA: Oh.

1357
01:30:49,255 --> 01:30:50,430
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

1358
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:51,763
MARISHA: Oh no!

1359
01:30:51,763 --> 01:30:53,524
SAM: I don't even know where that is on the
sheet!

1360
01:30:53,524 --> 01:30:55,019
LAURA: He could be evil. We could turn evil here!

1361
01:30:55,019 --> 01:31:02,343
MATT: As you wake up, you find yourself wracked by
those nightmares, a sense of nervousness comes to

1362
01:31:02,343 --> 01:31:07,882
you. And there's a tremor to your voice now that's
uncontrollable. At times of silence, you find

1363
01:31:07,882 --> 01:31:13,626
yourself impulsively clearing your throat. And
with that we're going to take a

1364
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:14,963
five-minute break.

1365
01:31:14,963 --> 01:31:16,351
MARISHA: What the fuck?!

1366
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:17,609
TALIESIN: Yay!

1367
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:21,023
MATT: All right guys, keep this to a stringent
five-minute break so we can get to as much as we

1368
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:24,631
can before the show's up tonight. So we'll see you
guys here in five minutes? All right?

1369
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:26,732
LIAM: See you in 17.

1370
01:31:26,732 --> 01:40:49,702
[break]

1371
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:54,559
MATT: Welcome back everyone. So, a couple quick
things. One, we're roughly 30 to 25 subs away from

1372
01:40:54,559 --> 01:40:59,337
our next milestone. The milestone, as we do with
every 100 subs, the winner in the chat room, as

1373
01:40:59,337 --> 01:41:04,027
long as you're active in it, gets a package of one
of our signed cast photos, as well as a wonderful

1374
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:09,031
poster art piece from our artist, Kit Buss, signed
by the cast, and that will also be our 10k mark.

1375
01:41:09,076 --> 01:41:10,852
TRAVIS: Damn!

1376
01:41:10,852 --> 01:41:12,123
LIAM: Damn, damn!

1377
01:41:12,123 --> 01:41:13,470
TRAVIS: Skittles, motherfucker!

1378
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:18,165
MATT: It's pretty fantastic. So, as soon as we hit
that we'll have our next giveaway and a big

1379
01:41:18,165 --> 01:41:19,903
celebration as we hit 10k.

1380
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:21,434
MARISHA: Get yourself a double cheeseburger.

1381
01:41:21,434 --> 01:41:24,404
LIAM: (singing) Look at the Sun Tree!

1382
01:41:24,404 --> 01:41:28,231
MATT: Also, you guys just caught, as that break
ended, a quick episode of Omnibus. Omnibus is a

1383
01:41:28,283 --> 01:41:32,957
new show that shows here every Tuesday. It's
helmed by Ian and Hector, some of our fantastic

1384
01:41:32,957 --> 01:41:37,036
hosts here. It talks about all sorts of things.
Not just Batman things. All sorts of things in

1385
01:41:37,036 --> 01:41:39,442
geek culture and-- what's that?

1386
01:41:39,442 --> 01:41:41,179
TALIESIN: There's more than Batman?

1387
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:46,570
MATT: There's more than Batman! It's crazy! I pop
up there every now and then to answer some

1388
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:50,591
questions and talk about some cool things, as well
as a number of other cool personalities that pop

1389
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:57,924
in and out. Check it out if you're around on
Tuesday. It's a lot of fun. All righty. So let's

1390
01:41:57,924 --> 01:42:05,752
kick back into this. So, a rough morning's rest
come to fruition. Percy seems a little worse for

1391
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:07,760
wear after the evening's sleep.

1392
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,103
MARISHA: You feeling okay?

1393
01:42:09,103 --> 01:42:10,605
TALIESIN: (grunts)

1394
01:42:10,605 --> 01:42:12,169
MARISHA: It was cold. Did you catch a cold?

1395
01:42:12,169 --> 01:42:13,119
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine.

1396
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,168
MARISHA: Is your throat ticklish?

1397
01:42:14,168 --> 01:42:15,387
TALIESIN: A little ticklish, I'm fine.

1398
01:42:15,387 --> 01:42:17,249
MARISHA: Do you want some Goodberries? It might
help a little bit--

1399
01:42:17,249 --> 01:42:18,343
LAURA: Keyleth.

1400
01:42:18,343 --> 01:42:19,336
MARISHA: What?

1401
01:42:19,336 --> 01:42:21,546
TALIESIN: I'll take some Goodberries.

1402
01:42:21,546 --> 01:42:24,949
MARISHA: All right. If you suck on them a little
bit they act like "logenzes."

1403
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:26,700
SAM: "Logenzes?"

1404
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,372
MARISHA: Well, shut up.

1405
01:42:28,372 --> 01:42:30,828
LIAM, SAM, and MARISHA: Kenny Logenzes.

1406
01:42:30,828 --> 01:42:33,851
MATT: It's a whole business opportunity that was
missed.

1407
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:36,902
LAURA: Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point,
hasn't it?

1408
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:38,096
MATT: Seeming has ended, yes.

1409
01:42:38,096 --> 01:42:39,157
LAURA: So, Trinket is a bear.

1410
01:42:39,157 --> 01:42:40,185
MATT: Trinket is now a bear.

1411
01:42:40,185 --> 01:42:41,117
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1412
01:42:41,117 --> 01:42:42,728
MATT: And not a donkey.

1413
01:42:42,728 --> 01:42:44,230
TRAVIS: And not a donkey.

1414
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,714
LIAM: But he's indoors with us, right?

1415
01:42:45,714 --> 01:42:48,451
LAURA: Yeah. I've been laying on him all night.

1416
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:53,612
TRAVIS: Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do
we get to kill today?

1417
01:42:53,612 --> 01:42:56,943
SAM: Sir Kerrion.

1418
01:42:56,943 --> 01:42:59,103
TRAVIS: How many mansions are there?

1419
01:42:59,103 --> 01:43:00,325
TALIESIN: There's three.

1420
01:43:00,325 --> 01:43:02,892
TRAVIS: Right. One, three.

1421
01:43:02,892 --> 01:43:05,380
LIAM: Do you know which one he lives in?

1422
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,258
TALIESIN: I don't.

1423
01:43:06,258 --> 01:43:07,202
LIAM: Shit.

1424
01:43:07,202 --> 01:43:12,961
SAM: Only one way to find out. Burn every house
down except for those three mansions and see who

1425
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:13,981
runs out.

1426
01:43:13,981 --> 01:43:15,383
TRAVIS: I like it. Seconded.

1427
01:43:15,383 --> 01:43:21,694
TALIESIN: I also think perhaps we should find a
new place to sleep tonight. I think it might be

1428
01:43:21,694 --> 01:43:25,734
best. To mix it up. Keep moving.

1429
01:43:25,734 --> 01:43:28,871
TRAVIS: But I've been peeing in the corner.

1430
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:32,337
LAURA: That's why it smells like it does. Grog!

1431
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:36,164
TRAVIS: What? Look, it's like they did in the old
days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my

1432
01:43:36,164 --> 01:43:44,762
corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah,
that's my brand.

1433
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:48,262
LIAM: That is ripe. We're leaving.

1434
01:43:48,262 --> 01:43:53,968
SAM: You want to all be peasants again? Can we not
just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes?

1435
01:43:53,968 --> 01:43:56,152
LAURA: I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the
bear?

1436
01:43:56,152 --> 01:43:59,130
SAM: Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear
behind.

1437
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:00,168
LAURA: In the house.

1438
01:44:00,168 --> 01:44:04,634
SAM: He could guard this safe house, and then we
could go find another safe house.

1439
01:44:04,634 --> 01:44:06,128
TALIESIN: Scanlan, cast the spell.

1440
01:44:06,128 --> 01:44:11,278
SAM: All right, fine. Seeming it is. We're all
peasants and he's a donkey. And I'm a little boy.

1441
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:15,534
MATT: You're a little boy. Jovial boy without a
yo-yo.

1442
01:44:15,534 --> 01:44:20,374
TALIESIN: There's a shop that I used to frequent.
We can see if that's perhaps been abandoned.

1443
01:44:20,374 --> 01:44:25,125
LAURA: All right. I want like a crazy eye in my
Seeming.

1444
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:28,163
SAM: Of course you can! I'll give you two crazy
eyes.

1445
01:44:28,163 --> 01:44:30,902
MATT: (laughs) You now have two crazy eyes.

1446
01:44:30,902 --> 01:44:34,734
LIAM: That's an improvement. That's nice.

1447
01:44:34,734 --> 01:44:37,051
MATT: The majesty of bardic illusion.

1448
01:44:37,051 --> 01:44:40,141
TALIESIN: So we're going to go to Beyond the
Horizon.

1449
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:42,064
MATT: Going to Beyond the Horizon?

1450
01:44:42,064 --> 01:44:42,904
TALIESIN: Yes.

1451
01:44:42,904 --> 01:44:49,903
MATT: All righty. You guys step out into the day's
sun. Today is fairly overcast. Clouds have taken

1452
01:44:49,903 --> 01:44:56,170
the sky, and there is a bit of a light mist that
is falling. Not quite rain, but not quite drizzle,

1453
01:44:56,170 --> 01:45:03,662
but just a mist in the air. It's a cold day. The
ground and most of the walkways and roads are a

1454
01:45:03,662 --> 01:45:09,141
little damp due to the moisture in the air. Not
muddy, just a little bit of a packed wetness to

1455
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:16,968
it. As you head over towards Beyond the Horizon,
and that lies more in the northwestern

1456
01:45:16,968 --> 01:45:23,342
quadrant of the city. A little ways around the
street from one of the noble houses, so you keep a

1457
01:45:23,418 --> 01:45:31,127
wide berth. You come to the row of shops that
bookended it before, and you go to the curiosity

1458
01:45:31,177 --> 01:45:37,092
shop to find that the building itself is partially
collapsed and ruined. The door is torn off the

1459
01:45:37,092 --> 01:45:41,722
hinges and left to the side. Part of the ceiling
is fallen in.

1460
01:45:41,722 --> 01:45:45,080
SAM: Is there a basement?

1461
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:49,596
LAURA: Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception
check to see if there's any kind of secret

1462
01:45:49,596 --> 01:45:53,247
entrances in the rubble at all? Something that
leads to a cellar?

1463
01:45:53,247 --> 01:45:56,597
MATT: Do you wander into the building? You guys are
still on the outside--

1464
01:45:56,597 --> 01:45:58,243
LIAM: How collapsed is it?

1465
01:45:58,243 --> 01:46:02,548
MATT: The whole building is still standing. It
just looks like the front entrance is caved in and

1466
01:46:02,548 --> 01:46:03,800
the doors were pulled off.

1467
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,523
LAURA: I'll just old lady walk into the building
and look around.

1468
01:46:07,523 --> 01:46:08,961
MATT: Okay.

1469
01:46:08,961 --> 01:46:11,748
LIAM: I'll go in with her.

1470
01:46:11,748 --> 01:46:13,230
TALIESIN: Do old ladies lick the air?

1471
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:16,727
LAURA: Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady
does.

1472
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:20,118
LIAM: Yeah, the eyes, they never go in the same
direction; one's always to the left

1473
01:46:20,118 --> 01:46:21,520
and one to the right.

1474
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:31,358
MATT: Looking about the inside, most of the
furniture has been broken or taken. You can see a

1475
01:46:31,358 --> 01:46:37,305
bunch of shelves set up as this was once a
curiosity shop. Empty. Anything of worth has long

1476
01:46:37,305 --> 01:46:38,910
been taken.

1477
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:43,131
SAM: Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?

1478
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:45,050
LAURA: I'm looking, boy.

1479
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:54,999
MATT: A large scattering of broken glass, and a
peppering of stains. Dark, ruddy stains across the

1480
01:46:54,999 --> 01:47:01,478
hardwood floors you can see spattered in places.
Occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance

1481
01:47:01,478 --> 01:47:06,432
a little (rat squeaking) sound. But there is no
other sign of life within the interior. Go ahead

1482
01:47:06,432 --> 01:47:08,863
and make an investigation check.

1483
01:47:08,863 --> 01:47:14,202
LAURA: Ooh, with no advantage, right?

1484
01:47:14,202 --> 01:47:16,172
MARISHA: What time is it?

1485
01:47:16,172 --> 01:47:17,439
SAM: Oh, until noon.

1486
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:19,146
MARISHA: Until 2PM, yo!

1487
01:47:19,146 --> 01:47:20,364
MATT: Wisdom check, not saving throw.

1488
01:47:20,364 --> 01:47:21,896
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

1489
01:47:21,896 --> 01:47:23,014
LIAM: 13.

1490
01:47:23,014 --> 01:47:25,313
MATT: 13?

1491
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:28,198
LIAM: 13.

1492
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:29,809
LAURA: That would have been an eight.

1493
01:47:29,809 --> 01:47:32,962
MATT: Eight. Okay. You take a while pushing
through some of the rubble, checking behind the

1494
01:47:32,962 --> 01:47:42,091
main desk, if you will, as to where most purchases
would have taken place. The place is cleared out,

1495
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:46,777
and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have
been left here for the better part of six months

1496
01:47:46,777 --> 01:47:47,901
to a year.

1497
01:47:47,901 --> 01:47:51,042
LAURA: I can't see any kind of like door that
leads to a cellar?

1498
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:59,572
MATT: Glancing about, you find what looks to be a
small cellar door that opens up in the floor in

1499
01:47:59,572 --> 01:48:04,015
one of the back rooms. You open it up, there's a
small ladder, not even a staircase, a ladder that

1500
01:48:04,015 --> 01:48:09,816
leads down in there. It's a small room, about ten
foot by ten foot. That room is also entirely

1501
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:10,993
cleaned out.

1502
01:48:10,993 --> 01:48:16,741
LAURA: All right. No yo-yos here, boy.

1503
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,771
SAM: Thanks, grandmama.

1504
01:48:18,771 --> 01:48:23,399
TALIESIN: Can we use this as a base of operations
in the moment, then?

1505
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:26,191
LAURA: But it's half-collapsed, it would not be
very protected.

1506
01:48:26,191 --> 01:48:27,484
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fully exposed.

1507
01:48:27,484 --> 01:48:30,785
SAM: Let's just take a walkabout and see if
there's anything else around the area.

1508
01:48:30,785 --> 01:48:34,453
TRAVIS: Do you want to head in one of the
directions of the mansions?

1509
01:48:34,453 --> 01:48:36,163
TALIESIN: Let's head to the closest mansion.

1510
01:48:36,163 --> 01:48:41,499
MATT: Okay. So you skirt back towards the the
crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads

1511
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:49,661
northward to the very, very far northwest section
of Whitestone. There you come to this noble

1512
01:48:49,711 --> 01:48:57,935
house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the
outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with

1513
01:48:57,935 --> 01:49:03,601
these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost
in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp

1514
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:08,680
enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over.
The front gate is currently chained off with a

1515
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:13,338
lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself
appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's

1516
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:19,770
moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there
is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a

1517
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:25,831
white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see
the building itself. It's a very nice building.

1518
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:35,047
It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like
natural stained wood from the local forest

1519
01:49:35,108 --> 01:49:42,727
surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep
green and black. There does not appear to be any

1520
01:49:42,807 --> 01:49:47,125
immediate sign of life from the inside, but there
does appear to be a light coming from the inside,

1521
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:52,643
so even at this point in the day, it can be dark
on the interior. You can see a little bit of light

1522
01:49:52,643 --> 01:49:54,284
coming from one of the doors.

1523
01:49:54,284 --> 01:49:59,092
MARISHA: Is there a mailbox with a name?

1524
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:00,814
(laughter)

1525
01:50:00,814 --> 01:50:02,840
SAM: Are there guards out front or anything, or is
it just a gate?

1526
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,243
MATT: It's just a gate, currently.

1527
01:50:04,243 --> 01:50:05,763
SAM: Do you want me to go in?

1528
01:50:05,763 --> 01:50:13,669
LAURA: What if we went to the fields and we asked
other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck.

1529
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:15,405
Keron. Keron?

1530
01:50:15,405 --> 01:50:16,390
TALIESIN: Kerrion.

1531
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,373
LAURA: Kerrion?

1532
01:50:17,373 --> 01:50:18,665
TRAVIS: Oh. That's actually a good one.

1533
01:50:18,665 --> 01:50:24,861
TALIESIN: I will say, chances that anybody in any
of these buildings is somebody we're going to want

1534
01:50:24,861 --> 01:50:26,763
to take care of is very high.

1535
01:50:26,763 --> 01:50:30,354
LAURA: So, just bust on in and kill them right
now.

1536
01:50:30,354 --> 01:50:31,975
SAM: Just, whoever's in there?

1537
01:50:31,975 --> 01:50:35,007
MARISHA: Is that actually what you're saying?

1538
01:50:35,007 --> 01:50:39,383
LIAM: And you went from focusing on Kerrion, to
kicking in doors?

1539
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,493
TRAVIS: Are you feeling all right?

1540
01:50:41,493 --> 01:50:43,233
LAURA: Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy.

1541
01:50:43,233 --> 01:50:44,586
TALIESIN: I am a little pale.

1542
01:50:44,586 --> 01:50:46,470
MARISHA: It's kind of like the game show problem.

1543
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:47,756
SAM: Well, you know.

1544
01:50:47,756 --> 01:50:52,247
LAURA: Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I
don't know, Restoration on you or something?

1545
01:50:52,247 --> 01:50:54,089
TALIESIN: I just had a bad night's sleep, that's
all.

1546
01:50:54,089 --> 01:50:55,559
TRAVIS: Scanlan, go knock on that door.

1547
01:50:55,559 --> 01:50:56,813
MARISHA: Do you have a fever?

1548
01:50:56,813 --> 01:50:59,159
SAM: I'm just a little peasant boy.

1549
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:00,405
MARISHA: Is he running a fever?

1550
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:02,201
MATT: He is not actually, he's quite cold and
clammy.

1551
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:03,785
MARISHA: Ew.

1552
01:51:03,785 --> 01:51:13,685
TALIESIN: My nice jacket. We can ask around. See
if we can manage to ask somebody without

1553
01:51:13,685 --> 01:51:14,993
arousing--

1554
01:51:14,993 --> 01:51:16,606
SAM: Is anyone else on the street?

1555
01:51:16,606 --> 01:51:22,558
MATT: Right now, in this particular area, there is
nobody on the street. You passed a few folks. A

1556
01:51:22,558 --> 01:51:24,892
lot of them seem to be traveling southward.

1557
01:51:24,892 --> 01:51:29,053
TALIESIN: How far are we from the temple? The
Alcove?

1558
01:51:29,053 --> 01:51:37,927
MATT: The Alcove is a little further east, it's probably
about a 15-minute walk. The other temple,

1559
01:51:37,976 --> 01:51:45,107
that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here.
It's closer to the southwestern side of the city.

1560
01:51:45,153 --> 01:51:49,891
TALIESIN: We could take a walk to the Lady's
Chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on

1561
01:51:49,891 --> 01:51:52,826
the way, and it's only ten minutes out of the
way.

1562
01:51:52,826 --> 01:51:54,247
TRAVIS: The Lady's Chamber?

1563
01:51:54,247 --> 01:51:56,870
TALIESIN: Not as exciting as it sounds.

1564
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:58,406
LIAM: You know someone there?

1565
01:51:58,406 --> 01:52:01,123
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's not looking like it.

1566
01:52:01,123 --> 01:52:05,964
SAM: I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The
other one was.

1567
01:52:05,964 --> 01:52:09,472
TRAVIS: All right, but I thought we were killing
somebody in this house.

1568
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,711
SAM: I thought so, too.

1569
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:11,812
TALIESIN: We'll get to it.

1570
01:52:11,812 --> 01:52:14,829
SAM: I can just pop in there and see who's in
there and pop out.

1571
01:52:14,829 --> 01:52:17,760
LAURA: Be killed? Never pop back out again.

1572
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,043
TALIESIN: He doesn't know what he looks like,
anyway.

1573
01:52:19,043 --> 01:52:21,731
SAM: I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a
harmless peasant boy.

1574
01:52:21,731 --> 01:52:25,694
TALIESIN: I think they would, actually. They
already have.

1575
01:52:25,694 --> 01:52:27,036
LAURA: We saw the tree.

1576
01:52:27,036 --> 01:52:31,016
TALIESIN: Genuine proof that they are perfectly
fine killing a small peasant boy.

1577
01:52:31,016 --> 01:52:36,777
LIAM: What is there in the way of guards out in the
open now, and those giants strolling about?

1578
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:42,475
MATT: The skulking humanoids you saw last night
that were wandering the streets? None of them

1579
01:52:42,616 --> 01:52:52,634
visible. You do take in that far down the road to
the east of you there is a large shape looming

1580
01:52:52,634 --> 01:52:55,159
around the corner in a shadow stretching across
the road.

1581
01:52:55,159 --> 01:52:57,595
And you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise).

1582
01:52:57,595 --> 01:52:59,385
LIAM: Are we within eyeshot of that thing right
now?

1583
01:52:59,385 --> 01:53:02,888
MATT: Not yet. It looks like it's coming around a
corner at the bend of the road

1584
01:53:02,888 --> 01:53:04,388
a ways to the east.

1585
01:53:04,388 --> 01:53:08,750
LIAM: Is there anyone our size, any humanoid
guards around?

1586
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:09,731
TRAVIS: No.

1587
01:53:09,731 --> 01:53:10,502
LIAM: Nothing?

1588
01:53:10,502 --> 01:53:11,760
MATT: Currently? No.

1589
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,711
LIAM: I'm guessing the best time to sneak into any
of these places is during the day.

1590
01:53:14,711 --> 01:53:17,845
MARISHA: Do we want to sneak in, though? You're
the only one who knows what they look like.

1591
01:53:17,845 --> 01:53:19,264
MATT: It's coming around the bend.

1592
01:53:19,264 --> 01:53:21,852
MARISHA: Okay, wait. Are the gates locked?

1593
01:53:21,852 --> 01:53:23,985
SAM: Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're
going to take a walk.

1594
01:53:23,985 --> 01:53:28,017
TALIESIN: We're going to take a little walk and
let it pass by. Let's go to the Lady's Chamber.

1595
01:53:28,017 --> 01:53:29,335
LIAM: Lady's Chambers, anyone?

1596
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:31,006
SAM: Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going
in.

1597
01:53:31,006 --> 01:53:34,328
LIAM: It's full of prostitutes, Grog. Full.

1598
01:53:34,328 --> 01:53:37,685
TALIESIN: You'll see. It's not really that
complicated.

1599
01:53:37,685 --> 01:53:39,983
LIAM: What did you roll?

1600
01:53:39,983 --> 01:53:44,507
MATT: All right. You guys dart southward across
the road, ducking into the alleys of the southern

1601
01:53:44,507 --> 01:53:49,361
portion of the road, getting out of the visual
range of the zombie giant that is making its way

1602
01:53:49,361 --> 01:53:56,362
down the road, across your path. Heading
southward, you dart through the back alleys and

1603
01:53:56,362 --> 01:54:02,528
keeping free of the main central visual areas of
the city, you eventually make your way to the

1604
01:54:02,528 --> 01:54:06,134
corner that houses the Lady's Chamber. And as you
guys see it--

1605
01:54:06,134 --> 01:54:08,356
SAM: Have we passed any people?

1606
01:54:08,356 --> 01:54:14,185
MATT: If you're keeping an eye out for that, yes.
In some of the alleyway, you do pass a couple that

1607
01:54:14,185 --> 01:54:20,431
are holding some, what looks like either scavenged
groceries or some sort of food they have keeping

1608
01:54:20,431 --> 01:54:21,475
close to themselves.

1609
01:54:21,475 --> 01:54:22,728
SAM: Can I go talk to them?

1610
01:54:22,728 --> 01:54:23,694
MATT: You can, indeed.

1611
01:54:23,694 --> 01:54:24,859
LAURA: I'm going to come with you.

1612
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:30,430
MATT: All right. As they're both walking by,
keeping the hush, they see you guys step in the

1613
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:34,984
same alley. They stop for a second, looking you
over, give a nod.

1614
01:54:34,984 --> 01:54:44,179
SAM: Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a
present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion?

1615
01:54:44,179 --> 01:54:45,106
LAURA: Kerrion?

1616
01:54:45,106 --> 01:54:46,205
SAM: Kerrion?

1617
01:54:46,205 --> 01:54:47,482
LAURA: Kerrion?

1618
01:54:47,482 --> 01:54:49,739
SAM: We're just looking to see where we can
deliver the gift.

1619
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:51,197
MATT: Make a deception check.

1620
01:54:51,197 --> 01:54:56,016
LIAM: Scanlan's forte. Come on.

1621
01:54:56,016 --> 01:54:57,045
SAM: 29.

1622
01:54:57,045 --> 01:54:59,312
(laughter)

1623
01:54:59,312 --> 01:55:07,056
MATT: You both stop and the man gives her a look
like he's trying to usher her along, pulling her

1624
01:55:07,056 --> 01:55:14,431
arm and she goes, "No, honey, it's just a child."
Walks up and leans forward and says, "If you're

1625
01:55:14,431 --> 01:55:22,054
"looking for Sir Kerrion, you'll find him in the
extravagant abode to the southeast of the city."

1626
01:55:22,054 --> 01:55:24,354
SAM: The one right over there?

1627
01:55:24,354 --> 01:55:34,356
MATT: "No." And gives you a side look for a second
and says, "You don't want to go find the Countess

1628
01:55:34,356 --> 01:55:40,116
"there. If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you go
to the southeast. Look for the brick building.

1629
01:55:40,116 --> 01:55:45,357
"That's where he stays. Near the farming area south
of us. You're not from here are you?"

1630
01:55:45,357 --> 01:55:47,568
LAURA: We're new to town.

1631
01:55:47,568 --> 01:55:49,249
SAM: She's blind.

1632
01:55:49,249 --> 01:55:53,578
MATT: "Well, just do what he says. Don't question.
All right?"

1633
01:55:53,578 --> 01:56:01,507
SAM: Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of
presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad.

1634
01:56:01,507 --> 01:56:02,910
TALIESIN: TMI.

1635
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:04,742
MATT: "Then perhaps you could do that quickly."

1636
01:56:04,742 --> 01:56:08,075
SAM: You're so pretty and clean.

1637
01:56:08,075 --> 01:56:15,402
MATT: She blushes for a second, goes like, "You
stay safe." And brushes the hair out of your eyes

1638
01:56:15,402 --> 01:56:20,224
for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit,
and there's a look of sadness in her eyes, almost

1639
01:56:20,224 --> 01:56:23,768
like, what horrible fate befalls this child, if
he's not careful.

1640
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:28,245
LAURA: I smack him on the back of the head and
say: Let's go boy! Keep up!

1641
01:56:28,245 --> 01:56:32,165
SAM: I'm her seeing-eye boy.

1642
01:56:32,165 --> 01:56:34,423
(laughter)

1643
01:56:34,423 --> 01:56:40,360
MATT: She rushes back to the side of the man with
her and, "See, it's fine. Good luck!" And they

1644
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,733
both dart off down the alley again.

1645
01:56:42,733 --> 01:56:46,539
LIAM: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentleman, he played
Gavroche in Les Mis. Gavroche, right here,

1646
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:47,616
Gavroche.

1647
01:56:47,616 --> 01:56:52,000
MATT: On Broadway. Literally.

1648
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,958
TALIESIN: He is Oliver Twist.

1649
01:56:53,958 --> 01:56:56,674
SAM: (singing) Consider yourself! (speaking) Oh,
that's a different show.

1650
01:56:56,674 --> 01:56:58,591
TALIESIN: I was ready! I was ready.

1651
01:56:58,591 --> 01:57:06,479
MATT: All right, so. You make your way southward
to probably what's the second largest road

1652
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:13,179
intersection in this city. Away from the Sun Tree
square. You can now see the temple to Erathis

1653
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:18,786
here. And it is a large stone half dome
amphitheater set up where it's built outward to

1654
01:57:18,786 --> 01:57:23,593
face the actual crossroads. And there is a
courtyard built around it, a small stone wall

1655
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:28,073
about three feet tall, that encapsulates this
area. There is a couple of trees, but there isn't

1656
01:57:28,073 --> 01:57:33,038
a lot of grass, most of it's just stonework--
Erathis being the goddess of civilization. You

1657
01:57:33,038 --> 01:57:39,539
know, it has an interesting duality and disrespect
to Melora and all unbridled nature. Things that

1658
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:45,798
are controlled and civilized are definitely her
realm of expertise. But as you approach, like most

1659
01:57:45,798 --> 01:57:52,121
of the grass here, it's pretty desolate and dead.
Winter is definitely making its way to this part

1660
01:57:52,121 --> 01:58:00,855
of the city. You do notice that surrounding it,
there is dried ivy, and just a general feeling of

1661
01:58:00,855 --> 01:58:05,093
solemn desperation and sadness. There are a few
people scattered throughout sitting on benches,

1662
01:58:05,093 --> 01:58:09,561
sitting in quiet contemplation. Some of them are
clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to

1663
01:58:09,561 --> 01:58:15,603
themselves while rocking in the bench. You do see
within the dome, there is a group of about four

1664
01:58:15,603 --> 01:58:20,517
people that are all sitting, looking up to a man,
an older man with a thick, white mustache and

1665
01:58:20,517 --> 01:58:27,657
receding white hair. His gray robes he's wearing
look weathered. You recognize him. While you

1666
01:58:27,657 --> 01:58:31,255
haven't had too much interaction, not being much
of a pious man, in any form of religion from your

1667
01:58:31,255 --> 01:58:35,513
history, but you do know, Keeper Yennen is the
head priest of Erathis here and is currently

1668
01:58:35,513 --> 01:58:41,002
giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those
here. Hearing him, he speaks words of comfort

1669
01:58:41,002 --> 01:58:47,755
talking of, through these dark days, we must bind
together as a community. We have to ensure that

1670
01:58:47,755 --> 01:58:56,498
our livelihood and our existence is kept, and we
look out for our fellow man. There is solace in

1671
01:58:56,498 --> 01:59:03,878
the friendships and bonds we keep here. And best
not to upset those that wish to keep us down.

1672
01:59:03,878 --> 01:59:10,542
Erathis looks over us. There will be a time in
which our salvation will come. And he goes into

1673
01:59:10,542 --> 01:59:14,067
this very rallying speech and trying to lift the
spirits of those around.

1674
01:59:14,067 --> 01:59:15,536
MARISHA: You said there was 40?

1675
01:59:15,536 --> 01:59:16,457
MATT: Four.

1676
01:59:16,457 --> 01:59:19,335
MARISHA: Four. Right.

1677
01:59:19,335 --> 01:59:21,245
SAM: But they're allowed to assemble?

1678
01:59:21,245 --> 01:59:26,620
MATT: Yeah. There's four around him in the
amphitheater. There are probably another ten or so

1679
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:30,902
scattered about the various ground surrounding it,
just doing their own private prayer.

1680
01:59:30,902 --> 01:59:33,365
TALIESIN: Do I have an opinion on Yennen?

1681
01:59:33,365 --> 01:59:42,134
MATT: Yennen? From your previous experience and
what you've heard is a very-- can be a bit

1682
01:59:42,134 --> 01:59:54,751
arrogant in his worship, but not in a way that is
considered dangerous or impactful to when the de

1683
01:59:54,751 --> 02:00:03,300
Rolo families were in rule. He does good for the
people. Kind of a tool at times. But he practices

1684
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:06,345
well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those
who worship.

1685
02:00:06,345 --> 02:00:08,925
TALIESIN: We found him a bit obnoxious to our
means and ends on occasion?

1686
02:00:08,982 --> 02:00:13,347
MATT: On occasion, but mostly just his
personality. Nothing he's done personally. He's

1687
02:00:13,347 --> 02:00:16,239
not a bad person, by any means. He's just, you
know.

1688
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:17,952
TALIESIN: He's also not a lapdog.

1689
02:00:17,952 --> 02:00:22,842
MATT: Yeah. Strong-willed in his ideas.

1690
02:00:22,842 --> 02:00:29,660
LAURA: Can we insight check him to see if it seems
like he's changed at all, or if he's still that

1691
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,201
same douchebag or if he's--

1692
02:00:31,201 --> 02:00:33,907
MATT: You would have no basis of comparison. You
would be the only one that has.

1693
02:00:33,963 --> 02:00:40,651
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to the little
meeting. Is it wrapping up right now?

1694
02:00:40,651 --> 02:00:46,977
MATT: It seems like it's winding down. He finishes
the discussion about the bonds of community,

1695
02:00:46,977 --> 02:00:55,074
speaks about this city sprang up from nothing, but
has a greater destiny to itself. If not here at

1696
02:00:55,074 --> 02:00:58,719
Whitestone, one day we will all go past these
boundaries, these borders, and create our own

1697
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:07,908
cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to
go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored

1698
02:01:07,908 --> 02:01:15,313
specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and
then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their

1699
02:01:15,313 --> 02:01:20,304
heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk
away from the amphitheater as he turns around and

1700
02:01:20,304 --> 02:01:23,669
begins to clear off one of the back benches for
him to sit on.

1701
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:27,774
TALIESIN: I'm going to just walk up and start a
conversation.

1702
02:01:27,774 --> 02:01:32,898
MATT: Okay. You walk up to him, he sits down. "Can
I help you?"

1703
02:01:32,898 --> 02:01:41,164
TALIESIN: Do you think there's any hope for
Whitestone? Do you think there'll be a day the

1704
02:01:41,164 --> 02:01:46,689
people can find happiness again?

1705
02:01:46,748 --> 02:01:53,758
MATT: "I can say this. If history has taught me
anything, our people are a resilient bunch. There

1706
02:01:53,758 --> 02:02:00,236
"has been much death, opposition, to all the free
peoples of these lands. And yet, they persevered

1707
02:02:00,236 --> 02:02:10,533
"and surmounted these odds. I think, though, to
some degree a prison this town may have become,

1708
02:02:10,533 --> 02:02:19,213
"perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends.
It's easy to misinterpret the means of those that

1709
02:02:19,213 --> 02:02:26,394
"would oppress us. But we can't go too long before
the world at large can see the atrocities

1710
02:02:26,394 --> 02:02:30,365
"committed, the terrible entities that walk these
streets."

1711
02:02:30,365 --> 02:02:35,705
TALIESIN: Do you think there will come a day that
these people can seize freedom for themselves

1712
02:02:35,705 --> 02:02:38,480
against their oppressors?

1713
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:46,854
MATT: "I look forward to a day in which there can
be a beacon of outside hope. From the inside, I

1714
02:02:46,854 --> 02:02:59,148
"fear many wills have been torn asunder. I'm sorry.
Forgive my manners. Welcome to the Lady's Chamber.

1715
02:02:59,148 --> 02:03:05,355
"You are unfamiliar to me." And he looks out at you
guys standing at the peripheral of the

1716
02:03:05,355 --> 02:03:10,115
amphitheater. "Travelers?"

1717
02:03:10,115 --> 02:03:11,279
TALIESIN: Yes.

1718
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:19,804
MATT: "I fear the cold winter is looming. An ill
omen takes this city, friends. You may stay to

1719
02:03:19,804 --> 02:03:25,824
"give worship, if you will, then I recommend you
continue on your way. There is little here but

1720
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,539
"dying tradition."

1721
02:03:27,539 --> 02:03:30,197
TALIESIN: I have a prayer to give.

1722
02:03:30,197 --> 02:03:33,246
MATT: "Interesting."

1723
02:03:33,246 --> 02:03:42,016
TALIESIN: I pray for a day to come when outside
forces can rally the people of Whitestone again.

1724
02:03:42,016 --> 02:03:48,088
That strangers may come and bring with them
salvation, and that the people will seize it.

1725
02:03:48,088 --> 02:03:56,317
MATT: "You speak in strange confidence for a
traveler."

1726
02:03:56,317 --> 02:04:04,749
TALIESIN: Look for signs, Keeper Yennen. Look for
signs. I'm going to hand him a piece of

1727
02:04:04,749 --> 02:04:06,053
parchment.

1728
02:04:06,053 --> 02:04:08,627
MATT: "Signs of what, I might ask?"

1729
02:04:08,627 --> 02:04:11,638
TALIESIN: Salvation. Good day to you, sir.

1730
02:04:11,638 --> 02:04:14,256
LIAM: Act cool. Everybody act cool.

1731
02:04:14,256 --> 02:04:15,910
TALIESIN: We walk south.

1732
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:18,091
TRAVIS: We walk south. We leave.

1733
02:04:18,091 --> 02:04:19,959
TALIESIN: And you know what I've left him.

1734
02:04:19,959 --> 02:04:29,425
MATT: Yeah. As you're walking away, you hear his
voice call out after. "Wait! What does this mean?"

1735
02:04:29,425 --> 02:04:36,457
He pulls the parchment forward, revealing the
symbol of the top of the de Rolo family crest.

1736
02:04:36,457 --> 02:04:50,580
TALIESIN: That... (sighs) What appears dead may
not necessarily be death. And that with the shadow

1737
02:04:50,642 --> 02:04:58,621
of death over the city perhaps there is life deep
underground. Perhaps things that appeared ended

1738
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:05,652
and gone are perhaps continuing to this day. And
may rise again.

1739
02:05:05,652 --> 02:05:13,639
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. Give
you advantage on this.

1740
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:16,550
TALIESIN: 16.

1741
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:23,738
MATT: Nods his head slowly, looks back at the
sheet. Looks back at you with a discerning look.

1742
02:05:23,738 --> 02:05:26,861
TALIESIN: He's definitely not going to--

1743
02:05:26,861 --> 02:05:33,961
MATT: Oh, not at all. You look like a dirty
peasant right now. Takes it and hastily closes it

1744
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:41,018
and folds it and puts it in the pouch. Steps back
over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves-- he

1745
02:05:41,018 --> 02:05:47,527
was making himself some tea-- and looks about
shiftily, calls over one of the other worshipers

1746
02:05:47,527 --> 02:05:50,279
and begins talking with them as you guys walk
away.

1747
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:51,225
TALIESIN: Let's head south.

1748
02:05:51,225 --> 02:05:52,083
TRAVIS: South it is.

1749
02:05:52,083 --> 02:05:53,079
SAM: To the--

1750
02:05:53,079 --> 02:05:54,031
LAURA: To the house?

1751
02:05:54,031 --> 02:05:54,866
SAM: To the house.

1752
02:05:54,866 --> 02:05:56,961
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell's stately manor.

1753
02:05:56,961 --> 02:05:59,146
MARISHA: So wait, which mansion were we at?

1754
02:05:59,146 --> 02:06:00,444
SAM and LAURA: The Countess.

1755
02:06:00,444 --> 02:06:02,255
TALIESIN: Countess Anna Ripley.

1756
02:06:02,255 --> 02:06:04,693
MARISHA: Which mansion is that out of the three?

1757
02:06:04,693 --> 02:06:05,773
TALIESIN: That's the northeastern one.

1758
02:06:05,773 --> 02:06:07,022
MARISHA: That's the northeastern one?

1759
02:06:07,022 --> 02:06:10,256
LAURA: And she was which? Who was the Countess
again?

1760
02:06:10,256 --> 02:06:15,335
TALIESIN: I'm assuming if it is who I suspect it
is, it's Countess Anna Ripley.

1761
02:06:15,335 --> 02:06:17,246
SAM: And who is she to you?

1762
02:06:17,246 --> 02:06:19,412
TALIESIN: She is a terrible person.

1763
02:06:19,412 --> 02:06:22,340
SAM: Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of
your people, right?

1764
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:23,697
MARISHA: She's the doctor, right?

1765
02:06:23,697 --> 02:06:24,732
TALIESIN: She's the doctor.

1766
02:06:24,732 --> 02:06:25,772
LAURA: Oh, she is the one!

1767
02:06:25,772 --> 02:06:28,242
TRAVIS: Do we get to kill her?

1768
02:06:28,242 --> 02:06:36,577
TALIESIN: I hope so. But let's-- one at a time. If
we're lucky, maybe one a day.

1769
02:06:36,577 --> 02:06:39,461
MARISHA: Well, okay.

1770
02:06:39,461 --> 02:06:41,224
TRAVIS: Like a vitamin?

1771
02:06:41,224 --> 02:06:46,700
SAM: Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's
assassination.

1772
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:49,334
TALIESIN: (coughs)

1773
02:06:49,334 --> 02:06:54,501
SAM: Do you need some healing? Are you okay?

1774
02:06:54,501 --> 02:06:55,978
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm fine.

1775
02:06:55,978 --> 02:06:57,379
SAM: Scanlan can make you feel good.

1776
02:06:57,379 --> 02:06:58,603
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

1777
02:06:58,603 --> 02:07:00,275
TRAVIS: (laughs) He can make you feel real good.

1778
02:07:00,275 --> 02:07:07,132
LAURA: Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his
earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on

1779
02:07:07,132 --> 02:07:11,870
him, without-- He's fighting it. I don't think
he's feeling well. Can you heal him?

1780
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:18,331
MARISHA: I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it
once I cast it on him, but I can try.

1781
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:24,377
LAURA: He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's
coughing a lot.

1782
02:07:24,377 --> 02:07:28,715
TRAVIS: Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold.

1783
02:07:28,715 --> 02:07:31,316
SAM: He's probably been up tinkering all night.

1784
02:07:31,316 --> 02:07:34,187
LIAM: Who are you to talk, Crazy Eyes?

1785
02:07:34,187 --> 02:07:35,236
LAURA: I know.

1786
02:07:35,236 --> 02:07:37,500
TALIESIN: I look like like a dirty peasant right
now.

1787
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,531
LAURA: No, that's true.

1788
02:07:38,531 --> 02:07:43,399
MARISHA: I don't know if my-- I don't know if
Greater Restoration will work.

1789
02:07:43,399 --> 02:07:45,719
LAURA: All right.

1790
02:07:45,719 --> 02:07:53,632
TALIESIN: Should only take 20 minutes to get to
the house, shouldn't it?

1791
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:54,887
MATT: Yeah. Approximately.

1792
02:07:54,887 --> 02:07:58,445
TALIESIN: We're not passing anything interesting
on the way, are we?

1793
02:07:58,445 --> 02:08:02,013
SAM: Any other safe houses? Potential candidates?

1794
02:08:02,013 --> 02:08:06,350
MATT: I mean, there are plenty of houses that
currently don't show signs of life.

1795
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:08,843
TALIESIN: I was thinking mostly of the barracks or
the Alcove.

1796
02:08:08,843 --> 02:08:13,088
SAM: Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're
going to need to know where to go.

1797
02:08:13,088 --> 02:08:14,599
TALIESIN: Got some thoughts.

1798
02:08:14,599 --> 02:08:17,762
SAM: Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to
immediately.

1799
02:08:17,762 --> 02:08:18,889
TALIESIN: The Lady's Chamber.

1800
02:08:18,889 --> 02:08:21,198
SAM: It's an amphitheater isn't it?

1801
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:24,114
TALIESIN: There's quarters. They'll be able to
hide us.

1802
02:08:24,114 --> 02:08:26,458
MARISHA: What makes you think they're going to
hide us?

1803
02:08:26,458 --> 02:08:27,848
TALIESIN: Hunch.

1804
02:08:27,848 --> 02:08:31,780
SAM: Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they
turn us out onto the street?

1805
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:36,292
TALIESIN: Actually, my thought was if we take care
of Stonefell, why don't we hide in his house?

1806
02:08:36,292 --> 02:08:39,859
LAURA: Nobody will know, right? Let's do it!

1807
02:08:39,859 --> 02:08:41,345
SAM: That's a good plan. They probably have some
good wine.

1808
02:08:41,345 --> 02:08:42,873
TRAVIS: I always wanted to be a lord.

1809
02:08:42,873 --> 02:08:45,654
SAM: All right. Let's go assassinate someone.

1810
02:08:45,654 --> 02:08:53,887
MARISHA: Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse
or anything, but--

1811
02:08:53,887 --> 02:08:56,209
TALIESIN: If it would make you feel better, you
can do whatever you like,

1812
02:08:56,209 --> 02:08:57,350
but I think it's just a tickle.

1813
02:08:57,350 --> 02:09:01,026
MARISHA: No. You're sure about all of this?

1814
02:09:01,026 --> 02:09:12,428
TALIESIN: This has been what I've been working for
for years. I'm not going to lose-- I was surprised

1815
02:09:12,505 --> 02:09:17,167
last time. I've had time to think about it. I'm
going to be all right. And I'm keeping it

1816
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:23,699
together. I'm not going to pretend that I'm great.
But I've got a hold on it.

1817
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:29,471
SAM: They also have technology, now. They have
weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could

1818
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:31,968
be a threat to many, many other people.

1819
02:09:31,968 --> 02:09:39,192
MARISHA: Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that
I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent

1820
02:09:39,192 --> 02:09:43,506
that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than
anything else.

1821
02:09:43,506 --> 02:09:50,689
TALIESIN: I've got a hold. And I respect that if
you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.

1822
02:09:50,689 --> 02:09:57,060
MARISHA: Okay. You followed me into the fiery
abyss, so--

1823
02:09:57,060 --> 02:10:00,725
TALIESIN: If that isn't a sign that I must be
crazy, I don't know what is.

1824
02:10:00,725 --> 02:10:06,697
MARISHA: Touché. I'll follow you, though. I'll
follow you to the end.

1825
02:10:06,697 --> 02:10:11,728
SAM: As the oldest among us, I say that he's
fine.

1826
02:10:11,728 --> 02:10:14,627
TALIESIN: Are you actually the oldest among us?

1827
02:10:14,627 --> 02:10:19,629
SAM: Well, I assume so. How old are you people?

1828
02:10:19,629 --> 02:10:20,514
LAURA: What?

1829
02:10:20,514 --> 02:10:21,438
TRAVIS: Me?

1830
02:10:21,438 --> 02:10:22,380
SAM: Yeah.

1831
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:26,536
TRAVIS: Somewhere between one and 50.

1832
02:10:26,536 --> 02:10:30,240
LIAM: Well, I'm 27, but I don't know how old she
is.

1833
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:35,053
MATT: And with that, rainfall begins to hit upon
the city--

1834
02:10:35,053 --> 02:10:36,562
LAURA: Oh no.

1835
02:10:36,562 --> 02:10:37,490
SAM: Let's go.

1836
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:41,965
MATT: The ground immediately becomes thick with
mud and sludge as you begin making your way

1837
02:10:41,965 --> 02:10:43,491
through the city to the eastern side.

1838
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:45,149
MARISHA: I go puddle hopping!

1839
02:10:45,149 --> 02:10:48,772
TALIESIN: This is not a happy place.

1840
02:10:48,772 --> 02:10:49,713
TRAVIS: Low key.

1841
02:10:49,713 --> 02:10:50,892
LIAM: Low key.

1842
02:10:50,892 --> 02:10:52,279
MARISHA: Oh. I look miserable.

1843
02:10:52,279 --> 02:10:53,475
TALIESIN: Look wet.

1844
02:10:53,475 --> 02:10:58,975
TRAVIS: I take the Dust of Tracelessness to void
out any footprints in the mud.

1845
02:10:58,975 --> 02:11:00,553
LIAM: It's been washed away with the rain.

1846
02:11:00,553 --> 02:11:05,901
MATT: You do it. As you walk along, you do, some
of the mud shifts behind you. It can be a little

1847
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:07,570
conspicuous if you're not careful.

1848
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:14,121
TRAVIS: Oh. Not my normal flower girl routine;
maybe it's like the old Shawshank Prison walk.

1849
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:16,445
(laughter)

1850
02:11:16,445 --> 02:11:17,941
TALIESIN: The old Shawshank Prison walk.

1851
02:11:17,941 --> 02:11:25,678
MATT: All right. The Alcove is a little ways
north. It would take some time. You're pushing at

1852
02:11:25,678 --> 02:11:30,570
like 10:30 in the morning at this point, around
11AM. Are you going straight to the supposed

1853
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:32,548
homestead of Kerrion Stonefell?

1854
02:11:32,548 --> 02:11:33,504
LAURA: Let's do it!

1855
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:34,557
LIAM: We're going straight there?

1856
02:11:34,557 --> 02:11:35,397
LAURA: Yeah.

1857
02:11:35,397 --> 02:11:36,470
TALIESIN: We're going straight there.

1858
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:39,649
MATT: All right. You bee-line it. You're all
getting cold from the wet rain that is now soaked

1859
02:11:39,649 --> 02:11:50,621
through your clothes. You make your way, and this
home is a deep, red brick in construction. This

1860
02:11:50,621 --> 02:11:54,483
house was not here when you lived here. It looks
like what house was here has been demolished and

1861
02:11:54,483 --> 02:12:06,254
rebuilt with sturdy masonry. It's a two-story
building. There appear to be two guards currently

1862
02:12:06,254 --> 02:12:12,540
set outside. Two regular leather-armor looking,
more thugs than guards, but they're just both

1863
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:18,978
keeping under the overhang at the front porch to
keep dry and grimacing at the weather. There is a

1864
02:12:18,978 --> 02:12:26,984
gate around it. This gate is more for purpose than
visual presentation. It's a black iron, nasty,

1865
02:12:26,984 --> 02:12:32,337
jagged, rusty-looking gate. Not too dissimilar to
the one that surrounded the graveyard. It's about

1866
02:12:32,337 --> 02:12:40,887
a 20-foot walk from the gate entrance to the front
step of the actual building itself. How do you

1867
02:12:40,887 --> 02:12:42,079
want to approach this?

1868
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,699
TALIESIN: Let's walk around the back, I think.

1869
02:12:43,699 --> 02:12:52,483
LIAM: As we walk up, I'd like to trail back by
Grog in the rain. The killing's going to start

1870
02:12:52,483 --> 02:13:03,542
soon. It's not going to stop. We're going to
protect them. All of them.

1871
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:06,640
(laughter)

1872
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,932
LIAM: Yeah, big guy?

1873
02:13:07,932 --> 02:13:09,181
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1874
02:13:09,181 --> 02:13:11,611
LIAM: All right.

1875
02:13:11,611 --> 02:13:16,147
SAM: Vax, you have your daggers back, right?

1876
02:13:16,147 --> 02:13:17,349
LIAM: I got them all.

1877
02:13:17,349 --> 02:13:20,683
LAURA: I put a couple arrows in the holy oil that
we have.

1878
02:13:20,683 --> 02:13:23,778
MATT: All right. Each holy oil is essentially
three--

1879
02:13:23,778 --> 02:13:27,332
LAURA: Oh, can I just dip one arrow in, then, 
right now?

1880
02:13:27,405 --> 02:13:32,981
MATT: Mark that off from one of your holy oils,
you have one of three uses of that, and that that

1881
02:13:32,981 --> 02:13:35,832
arrow does have a holy oil essence.

1882
02:13:35,832 --> 02:13:42,181
SAM: Percival? If we get in there, what are the
chances that this gentleman, Sir Kerrion--

1883
02:13:42,235 --> 02:13:43,494
Korean--

1884
02:13:43,494 --> 02:13:46,709
TALIESIN: You can mispronounce his name. It's
fine.

1885
02:13:46,709 --> 02:13:48,006
MARISHA: Sir North Korean.

1886
02:13:48,006 --> 02:13:49,369
TALIESIN: Sir Starbucks, yes.

1887
02:13:49,369 --> 02:13:57,258
SAM: Sir Starbucks. What are the chances that he's
going to be in a coffin? Sleeping?

1888
02:13:57,258 --> 02:13:58,404
TALIESIN: 50-50.

1889
02:13:58,404 --> 02:14:00,282
SAM: Okay. All right. Good to know.

1890
02:14:00,282 --> 02:14:05,781
TRAVIS: Would it be worthwhile to maybe say that
the little boy and the old lady were caught

1891
02:14:05,781 --> 02:14:11,843
hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy,
see if we can draw him out of his house?

1892
02:14:11,843 --> 02:14:14,739
SAM: Ooh, that's a cool plan. I like that plan!

1893
02:14:14,739 --> 02:14:16,100
MARISHA: It is raining.

1894
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:17,577
SAM: Oh, wait, but I would be bait?

1895
02:14:17,577 --> 02:14:18,341
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1896
02:14:18,341 --> 02:14:19,308
SAM: Okay, fine.

1897
02:14:19,308 --> 02:14:23,017
TALIESIN: Let's take a long walk around the house
to see if there's a way in through the back.

1898
02:14:23,017 --> 02:14:23,817
TRAVIS: Okay.

1899
02:14:23,817 --> 02:14:24,947
MARISHA: It's dark. It's raining.

1900
02:14:24,947 --> 02:14:28,637
TALIESIN: And I can't imagine that many people
attempt to infiltrate this house.

1901
02:14:28,637 --> 02:14:29,893
LIAM: How dark is it?

1902
02:14:29,893 --> 02:14:35,517
MATT: I mean, it's overcast, but it's getting
closer to noon. Even though you can't see the sun,

1903
02:14:35,517 --> 02:14:43,371
and it is dark clouds overhead, it is still a
general universal storm light. Darkened daylight.

1904
02:14:43,371 --> 02:14:44,677
TRAVIS: Once around?

1905
02:14:44,677 --> 02:14:46,624
MARISHA: Does it look like it's going to pass
soon?

1906
02:14:46,624 --> 02:14:51,131
MATT: No. It looks like it's probably going to be
here for most of the day at the very least.

1907
02:14:51,131 --> 02:14:56,819
SAM: The rain will dampen the screams from inside.
So we go around once? Once around?

1908
02:14:56,819 --> 02:15:02,173
MATT: Okay. Perception checks all around.

1909
02:15:02,173 --> 02:15:03,463
SAM: Perception check.

1910
02:15:03,463 --> 02:15:08,018
LIAM: I'm looking specifically for ways in the
building other than the front door.

1911
02:15:08,018 --> 02:15:13,125
SAM: I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a
two.

1912
02:15:13,125 --> 02:15:14,242
TRAVIS: Four.

1913
02:15:14,242 --> 02:15:15,200
TALIESIN: 21.

1914
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,373
LAURA: 24.

1915
02:15:16,373 --> 02:15:17,331
LIAM: 20.

1916
02:15:17,331 --> 02:15:18,310
MARISHA: 21.

1917
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:26,621
MATT: All right. I will say above 20s, you guys
notice there is a cellar door outside the building

1918
02:15:26,621 --> 02:15:30,741
that descends beneath it. There's no indicator as
to whether or not it's attached to the house or if

1919
02:15:30,741 --> 02:15:37,217
it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter
from the outside. You do also see there are a

1920
02:15:37,217 --> 02:15:41,589
number of windows around the household that are
all currently closed that lead into the interior.

1921
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:49,162
You're uncertain if they're locked or open.
There's a little bit of light from the inside.

1922
02:15:49,162 --> 02:15:51,534
MARISHA: Like candlelight?

1923
02:15:51,534 --> 02:15:56,751
MATT: Like candlelight or lantern light, the
darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight

1924
02:15:56,751 --> 02:16:01,180
that would warm a building or light it up from the
inside has been cut off by the rainstorm. So,

1925
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,833
there is a necessity for internal lighting.

1926
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:08,786
MARISHA: Is there any sign of windows that are
blacked out?

1927
02:16:08,786 --> 02:16:16,386
MATT: No, but you do notice that one of the
windows to the far back side of the building where

1928
02:16:16,386 --> 02:16:22,085
most of the light's coming from-- occasionally the
light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past

1929
02:16:22,085 --> 02:16:26,269
it. There's movement within that room nearish that
window.

1930
02:16:26,269 --> 02:16:27,807
SAM: They're watching TV.

1931
02:16:27,807 --> 02:16:32,104
LAURA: Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

1932
02:16:32,104 --> 02:16:33,272
SAM: Ooh, thank you!

1933
02:16:33,272 --> 02:16:35,775
MARISHA: Are we going through the cellar?

1934
02:16:35,775 --> 02:16:38,810
SAM: Is our meal still affecting us?

1935
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:40,188
TALIESIN: Until two.

1936
02:16:40,188 --> 02:16:42,163
SAM: Yes! Let's go in quick!

1937
02:16:42,163 --> 02:16:46,624
LAURA: Is it possible to see what the movement is,
who it is inside that window?

1938
02:16:46,624 --> 02:16:51,556
MATT: Not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from
the building and you guys trying to be

1939
02:16:51,556 --> 02:16:52,941
inconspicuous.

1940
02:16:52,941 --> 02:16:55,763
LIAM: There's nothing between us and the
building?

1941
02:16:55,763 --> 02:17:03,884
MATT: There is the gate. The gate, and what looks
to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that

1942
02:17:03,884 --> 02:17:07,916
are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding
it.

1943
02:17:07,916 --> 02:17:12,303
LAURA: Is the cellar door hidden from view of
everything or is it out in the open?

1944
02:17:12,303 --> 02:17:13,507
MATT: Which one?

1945
02:17:13,507 --> 02:17:14,913
LAURA: The cellar door that we saw.

1946
02:17:14,913 --> 02:17:19,216
MATT: The cellar door is out in the open,
buttressed against the back of the house. It's up against

1947
02:17:19,216 --> 02:17:22,940
the ground on the side. It has two doors that open
up and lead into the cellar below.

1948
02:17:23,008 --> 02:17:25,582
LAURA: Does it look like anybody can see us?

1949
02:17:25,582 --> 02:17:30,291
MATT: From where you're standing? No. You're going
to be hardpressed to get across without being in

1950
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:32,282
sight of somebody if someone were nearby.

1951
02:17:32,282 --> 02:17:35,354
MARISHA: We're between a fence, right?

1952
02:17:35,354 --> 02:17:36,798
MATT: You're on the outside of a fence.

1953
02:17:36,798 --> 02:17:42,720
TRAVIS: Do we want to try to draw them out or get
to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards

1954
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:43,953
are going to die.

1955
02:17:43,953 --> 02:17:45,065
MARISHA: There are guards?

1956
02:17:45,065 --> 02:17:46,385
LAURA and SAM: There's two guards.

1957
02:17:46,385 --> 02:17:49,905
MATT: They're currently not in visual range of
you. They're guarding the front of the building.

1958
02:17:49,905 --> 02:17:52,514
You guys moved around back. So you don't see the
two guards currently on the

1959
02:17:52,514 --> 02:17:53,831
opposite side of the house.

1960
02:17:53,831 --> 02:17:55,784
TRAVIS: What's the fence made out of? Is it the
spear-y shit?

1961
02:17:55,784 --> 02:17:57,613
MARISHA: Is it poky up top?

1962
02:17:57,613 --> 02:17:58,572
MATT: It is poky. yes.

1963
02:17:58,572 --> 02:17:59,555
TRAVIS: It is poky.

1964
02:17:59,555 --> 02:18:02,168
MATT: It's not super sharp poky, but there's iron
rods.

1965
02:18:02,168 --> 02:18:03,749
TRAVIS: So, I could throw Scanlan over.

1966
02:18:03,749 --> 02:18:05,216
LIAM: If you roll a two, you can get hurt.

1967
02:18:05,216 --> 02:18:08,627
MATT: Yeah, if you rolled poorly, it's going to
deal some damage.

1968
02:18:08,765 --> 02:18:11,197
SAM: Should we do a diversion for the guards?

1969
02:18:11,369 --> 02:18:12,767
LAURA: They can't even see us, though!

1970
02:18:12,767 --> 02:18:15,810
SAM: Yes, but once we go through the fence, they
might. I don't know.

1971
02:18:15,810 --> 02:18:17,297
All right, you want to sneak in?

1972
02:18:17,297 --> 02:18:23,173
TALIESIN: Let's try to sneak in and leave the
guards there unless they notice us and then we'll

1973
02:18:23,173 --> 02:18:24,464
just (thwip thwip).

1974
02:18:24,464 --> 02:18:25,553
SAM: All right, sure!

1975
02:18:25,553 --> 02:18:27,981
TRAVIS: How do we sneak in past them?

1976
02:18:27,981 --> 02:18:30,490
TALIESIN: You want to try to pull one of the
wrought irons off, maybe?

1977
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:32,122
TRAVIS: I'd be down for that.

1978
02:18:32,122 --> 02:18:39,809
SAM: If I puffed some smoke, would it draw
attention to us?

1979
02:18:39,809 --> 02:18:40,753
TALIESIN: Yes.

1980
02:18:40,753 --> 02:18:42,298
SAM: Okay, then never mind.

1981
02:18:42,298 --> 02:18:45,489
TALIESIN: It's raining. We can make a little
noise, it'll be okay.

1982
02:18:45,489 --> 02:18:47,208
LIAM: Where are the guards in the front?

1983
02:18:47,208 --> 02:18:49,526
MATT: They're currently on the opposite side of
the building. If you guys are looking at the back.

1984
02:18:49,526 --> 02:18:51,642
They're in the front of the building guarding the
front door.

1985
02:18:51,642 --> 02:18:53,915
LIAM: Inside the gate at the house?

1986
02:18:53,915 --> 02:18:54,925
MATT: Correct.

1987
02:18:54,925 --> 02:18:57,186
MARISHA: Want me to heat up that metal bar for
you?

1988
02:18:57,186 --> 02:19:00,689
LIAM: We still have to go over and in.

1989
02:19:00,689 --> 02:19:01,897
TRAVIS: Sure.

1990
02:19:01,897 --> 02:19:05,721
LAURA: Let's just up and over the bar,
athletic it. Acrobatics it?

1991
02:19:05,721 --> 02:19:08,537
LIAM: Grog, can you bend that shit open?

1992
02:19:08,537 --> 02:19:10,952
MATT: Your donkey's still there beside you.

1993
02:19:10,952 --> 02:19:12,056
LAURA: Fuck!

1994
02:19:12,056 --> 02:19:14,767
LIAM: Yeah, well, if Grog can frigging make a hole
in there--

1995
02:19:14,767 --> 02:19:16,744
TRAVIS: Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars?

1996
02:19:16,744 --> 02:19:18,855
MATT: You're more than welcome to. Go ahead and
make a strength check.

1997
02:19:18,915 --> 02:19:20,181
MARISHA: The bar that he's--

1998
02:19:20,181 --> 02:19:22,261
TALIESIN: Lou Ferrigno-ing.

1999
02:19:22,261 --> 02:19:26,929
MARISHA: -- Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat
Metal.

2000
02:19:27,029 --> 02:19:29,155
SAM: Is that going to burn his hands?

2001
02:19:29,155 --> 02:19:30,572
MARISHA: Put on some gloves.

2002
02:19:30,572 --> 02:19:31,917
TRAVIS: I don't have any gloves.

2003
02:19:31,917 --> 02:19:34,427
MARISHA: Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and
bear it.

2004
02:19:34,427 --> 02:19:35,702
SAM: It's raining. It'll be fine.

2005
02:19:35,702 --> 02:19:42,372
MATT: So, you cast Heat Metal on the bars and a
certain area of this gate begins to glow with a

2006
02:19:42,372 --> 02:19:50,301
dull orange to become a brighter orange, and
portions of it going whitish-hot in places.

2007
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:51,920
SAM: Why don't you just hit it with something?

2008
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:52,982
LAURA: Wrap your hands.

2009
02:19:52,982 --> 02:19:54,523
MARISHA: You can use your axe.

2010
02:19:54,523 --> 02:20:00,381
MATT: The rain, by the way, is puffing against it
and evaporating as it

2011
02:20:00,381 --> 02:20:02,135
impacts the now-heated metal.

2012
02:20:02,135 --> 02:20:03,244
SAM: But that'll be loud!

2013
02:20:03,244 --> 02:20:04,644
MARISHA: You do you! You do you, Grog.

2014
02:20:04,644 --> 02:20:05,785
TRAVIS: I rolled a 23.

2015
02:20:05,785 --> 02:20:13,751
MATT: 23? Okay, you reach over and grab it, your
hands smoking on the-- use the pain! Use the pain

2016
02:20:13,751 --> 02:20:21,035
and pull down the bars. You get a large portion of
the gate to actually bend downward into an arc,

2017
02:20:21,035 --> 02:20:26,328
causing the whole gate to fold inward on that
side, making it much easier for anyone to pass

2018
02:20:26,328 --> 02:20:33,897
through. However, you do suffer nine points of
fire damage from the burn and your hands are

2019
02:20:33,897 --> 02:20:35,433
currently scalded.

2020
02:20:35,433 --> 02:20:36,871
TALIESIN: Now we can get Trinket in!

2021
02:20:36,871 --> 02:20:38,815
LIAM: That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.

2022
02:20:38,815 --> 02:20:40,854
TRAVIS: It's all right.

2023
02:20:40,854 --> 02:20:45,442
MARISHA: I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his
hands.

2024
02:20:45,442 --> 02:20:51,802
MATT: Okay. So it's 1d4 plus six. She's rolling
it.

2025
02:20:51,802 --> 02:20:53,702
MARISHA: Ooh! 11.

2026
02:20:53,702 --> 02:20:54,925
TRAVIS: Hey, back to full!

2027
02:20:54,925 --> 02:21:02,123
MATT: So, the scarring stays for a bit. You do
smell the burning flesh, but there's no lasting

2028
02:21:02,123 --> 02:21:03,402
wounds on your hands.

2029
02:21:03,402 --> 02:21:09,591
TALIESIN: You can check to see if there's a lock
on the cellar door?

2030
02:21:09,591 --> 02:21:10,745
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

2031
02:21:10,745 --> 02:21:12,329
TRAVIS: We gotta make it across the lawn first.

2032
02:21:12,329 --> 02:21:13,498
LAURA: Well, we're in the back of the house.

2033
02:21:13,498 --> 02:21:15,040
LIAM: Well, we're all just walking very quietly.

2034
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,140
LAURA: We're stealthing.

2035
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:17,824
MATT: So, everyone make a stealth check.

2036
02:21:17,824 --> 02:21:19,060
TALIESIN: We have advantage?

2037
02:21:19,060 --> 02:21:23,352
MATT: No, everyone gets plus ten to their stealth.
You have disadvantage

2038
02:21:23,352 --> 02:21:24,662
on the stealth check, though.

2039
02:21:24,662 --> 02:21:25,680
SAM: Plus ten.

2040
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,551
MATT: Yes, plus ten to your stealth roll.

2041
02:21:27,551 --> 02:21:29,782
SAM: 17.

2042
02:21:29,782 --> 02:21:32,155
TRAVIS: 23.

2043
02:21:32,155 --> 02:21:33,088
LIAM: 34.

2044
02:21:33,088 --> 02:21:35,083
LAURA: 32.

2045
02:21:35,083 --> 02:21:36,928
MARISHA: 34.

2046
02:21:36,928 --> 02:21:38,004
TALIESIN: 26!

2047
02:21:38,004 --> 02:21:46,648
MATT: All righty. You guys all keeping low and
quickly darting across the grass field. You make

2048
02:21:46,648 --> 02:21:51,592
your way, pattering across the somewhat slick
grass. The rain is a little warmer than the frost

2049
02:21:51,592 --> 02:21:57,046
that kept the grounds frozen as the morning came
to. So, it's a little slick, but you make your way

2050
02:21:57,046 --> 02:22:01,001
to the back of the building. You're still loosely
out in the open, in a weird way, so you don't want

2051
02:22:01,001 --> 02:22:04,489
to be out in the open for a long period of time.
This isn't a safe place. You're currently,

2052
02:22:04,489 --> 02:22:09,151
apparently made it to this side of the building
unnoticed. But you don't want to stay here very

2053
02:22:09,224 --> 02:22:13,675
long because you are visible to anyone who's on
either side of the gate exterior.

2054
02:22:13,675 --> 02:22:16,352
LIAM: I'm going straight to the cellar door.

2055
02:22:16,352 --> 02:22:18,094
LAURA: Up against the wall of the building.

2056
02:22:18,094 --> 02:22:21,884
LIAM: I give it a little (clunk) to see what I
feel.

2057
02:22:21,884 --> 02:22:23,936
MATT: It is locked. It does gives resistance.

2058
02:22:23,936 --> 02:22:25,021
LIAM: I get to work.

2059
02:22:25,021 --> 02:22:26,306
MARISHA: Do your thing.

2060
02:22:26,306 --> 02:22:30,519
LAURA: I feel like it's been a while since you've
done this.

2061
02:22:30,519 --> 02:22:31,507
LIAM: Did what?

2062
02:22:31,507 --> 02:22:32,525
LAURA: Lockpicking.

2063
02:22:32,525 --> 02:22:37,098
LIAM: I already did it earlier when you
weren't here. 14, that's 27.

2064
02:22:37,143 --> 02:22:40,127
MATT: 27. You reach over, without even looking.
You grab the lock; you're familiar with this kind

2065
02:22:40,127 --> 02:22:46,359
of lock. (clicking) You take the lock off the
chain. The chains fall loose against the opposite

2066
02:22:46,359 --> 02:22:54,309
side of the, or the inside of the door. You pull
it open. It's dark inside. You can see the dry

2067
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:59,393
stone steps that lead down below the building as
rain starts darkening them with drops that are

2068
02:22:59,393 --> 02:23:00,380
hitting them.

2069
02:23:00,380 --> 02:23:03,978
LIAM: I lean my head in really fast and just see
if I can hear anything, and roll a one.

2070
02:23:03,978 --> 02:23:10,278
LAURA: Could I stealth in a couple of steps look
around and see if there's anybody in there, or

2071
02:23:10,278 --> 02:23:11,123
hear anything?

2072
02:23:11,123 --> 02:23:12,580
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

2073
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:19,743
LIAM: No, I said it's good! It's good! Let's go!
Right? You agree. We're never wrong!

2074
02:23:19,814 --> 02:23:21,131
LAURA: 19.

2075
02:23:21,131 --> 02:23:26,645
MATT: 19. Listening to the inside. The smell's a
little musty, like a cellar you'd expect. But a

2076
02:23:26,645 --> 02:23:31,924
little bit of dust and untouched earth. There's
nothing down there; no movement, no sound.

2077
02:23:31,966 --> 02:23:36,634
LAURA: It's clear, let's go! Ish!

2078
02:23:36,679 --> 02:23:42,502
MATT: You all drop in. Darting into-- which is
good, because you notice around the corner one of

2079
02:23:42,502 --> 02:23:47,790
the giants is turning the corner. You all dive
inside, close the cellar doors. Bringing you to

2080
02:23:47,838 --> 02:23:49,231
the interior.

2081
02:23:49,231 --> 02:23:50,874
LAURA: I wonder if they're going to notice that
fence.

2082
02:23:50,874 --> 02:23:51,911
SAM: They might.

2083
02:23:51,911 --> 02:23:56,648
MATT: You hear the pattering of rain across the
wooden doors of the cellar. You made your way down

2084
02:23:56,648 --> 02:24:01,947
underneath. And it is pitch black. There is no
light source down here.

2085
02:24:02,122 --> 02:24:04,655
LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger.

2086
02:24:04,655 --> 02:24:07,030
MATT: Okay. A little bit of flame causes enough
candlelight to see the surface.

2087
02:24:07,030 --> 02:24:08,726
And it is a wine cellar.

2088
02:24:08,726 --> 02:24:09,909
TRAVIS: I have Darkvision.

2089
02:24:09,909 --> 02:24:12,587
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands.

2090
02:24:12,587 --> 02:24:18,077
MATT: Okay, so with an instant of will, all of a
sudden flames burst around--

2091
02:24:18,077 --> 02:25:34,167
[no audio]

2092
02:25:34,198 --> 02:25:39,020
MATT: -- is a small ladder in the corner that seems
to lead up to a latched door that leads to the

2093
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:40,329
interior of the house.

2094
02:25:40,329 --> 02:25:42,217
LAURA: I got up to it and listen.

2095
02:25:42,217 --> 02:25:43,864
MATT: Make a perception check.

2096
02:25:43,864 --> 02:25:51,316
LAURA: I don't hear anything, you guys.
I think it's fine!

2097
02:25:51,372 --> 02:25:54,601
LIAM: My ears are bigger than yours. Let me have a
listen. Get down.

2098
02:25:54,601 --> 02:25:56,774
LAURA: Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine!

2099
02:25:56,774 --> 02:25:58,211
LIAM: Definitely, look at them!

2100
02:25:58,211 --> 02:26:01,642
MATT: Your sister assures you she heard--

2101
02:26:01,642 --> 02:26:03,171
LAURA: There's nothing there!

2102
02:26:03,171 --> 02:26:05,553
LIAM: I don't hear anything, either. I think we
should just bust in.

2103
02:26:05,553 --> 02:26:06,469
SAM: Okay!

2104
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:07,456
TRAVIS: Wait.

2105
02:26:07,456 --> 02:26:08,556
TALIESIN: (whispers) Quietly!

2106
02:26:08,556 --> 02:26:12,238
MARISHA: Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait!

2107
02:26:12,238 --> 02:26:15,665
LIAM: I keep forgetting the rogue skill, so really
I rolled a 20.

2108
02:26:15,665 --> 02:26:19,559
SAM: Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes
a 20?!

2109
02:26:19,559 --> 02:26:24,732
LIAM: For perception, I can no longer roll lower
than ten, unless I roll a one. But if it's a two

2110
02:26:24,732 --> 02:26:27,843
or nine, it's actually a ten for me.

2111
02:26:27,843 --> 02:26:29,130
LAURA: That's awesome.

2112
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:30,539
MATT: Rogues are pretty cool.

2113
02:26:30,539 --> 02:26:31,540
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

2114
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,704
LAURA: Yep, rogues are awesome.

2115
02:26:32,704 --> 02:26:33,976
TRAVIS: Rogues are whatever.

2116
02:26:33,976 --> 02:26:38,943
MATT: So you put your ear up to it and listen
carefully. And you hear pacing footsteps creaking

2117
02:26:38,943 --> 02:26:42,290
against wood no more than maybe four feet away
from you.

2118
02:26:42,290 --> 02:26:43,603
LIAM: Is that one person?

2119
02:26:43,603 --> 02:26:49,021
MATT: One person stops and then moves again, then
moves again almost like there's pacing, and you

2120
02:26:49,021 --> 02:26:56,934
hear low voices. It's a conversation; there's two
voices. You hear one voice very muffled, but it

2121
02:26:56,934 --> 02:27:01,525
seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman
that came across you guys on the street that

2122
02:27:01,525 --> 02:27:04,700
actually briefly talked to Percy the day before.

2123
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:06,311
LIAM: The old guy; the balding guy?

2124
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:08,843
MATT: The balding guy with the long stringy gray
hair.

2125
02:27:08,843 --> 02:27:11,449
LIAM: He's just reporting in. He's his frigging
money collector.

2126
02:27:11,449 --> 02:27:13,740
MATT: The other voice you don't recognize, and
it's too muffled for you to make out anything.

2127
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:21,094
About four feet from you, not over the cellar, but
off a ways to it. You're not certain where this

2128
02:27:21,094 --> 02:27:28,228
doorway leads to, the level of muffling you can
hear through the floor leads you to believe that

2129
02:27:28,228 --> 02:27:29,800
they're not directly above you.

2130
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:36,250
LIAM: Not directly above. All right. There's
nobody right above us,

2131
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,832
but there's people in the house.

2132
02:27:37,832 --> 02:27:39,984
LAURA: They might be close.

2133
02:27:39,984 --> 02:27:41,255
TRAVIS: Just to be clear--

2134
02:27:41,255 --> 02:27:44,736
LIAM: No, they're on another floor or in another
room.

2135
02:27:44,736 --> 02:27:48,467
TRAVIS: Before we start: we're killing everything,
right?

2136
02:27:48,467 --> 02:27:49,463
TALIESIN: Yes.

2137
02:27:49,463 --> 02:27:54,490
TRAVIS: Okay, good. Do we want to send one person
out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto

2138
02:27:54,490 --> 02:27:55,868
if it all goes wrong?

2139
02:27:55,868 --> 02:27:59,506
MARISHA: Last time we did that, it went really
well.

2140
02:27:59,506 --> 02:28:01,033
TRAVIS: Did we do that before?

2141
02:28:01,033 --> 02:28:03,391
LIAM: No, we didn't send anyone, I just--

2142
02:28:03,391 --> 02:28:05,063
TALIESIN: Let's just go one room at a time.

2143
02:28:05,063 --> 02:28:07,877
SAM: One room at a time? We have to get up 
through this latch

2144
02:28:07,877 --> 02:28:09,532
and there's people right above us!

2145
02:28:09,532 --> 02:28:12,948
LIAM: Scanlan, you or me? You want to go
invisible, or do you want me to creep in?

2146
02:28:12,948 --> 02:28:19,739
SAM: I think you should have some fun, too. But
before we do anything, do you want me to send a

2147
02:28:19,739 --> 02:28:23,014
cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the
area?

2148
02:28:23,067 --> 02:28:24,459
LIAM and TALIESIN: No.

2149
02:28:24,459 --> 02:28:26,216
TALIESIN: Let's not let them know we're here.

2150
02:28:26,216 --> 02:28:35,077
LAURA: Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you
maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all

2151
02:28:35,077 --> 02:28:36,652
bent to shit?

2152
02:28:36,652 --> 02:28:41,242
LIAM: Zombie guards aren't going to-- giants are
stupid.

2153
02:28:41,242 --> 02:28:42,370
SAM: It'll be fine.

2154
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:45,474
LIAM: They're stupid. I mean, there are the guys
out front.

2155
02:28:45,474 --> 02:28:46,453
LAURA: Yeah.

2156
02:28:46,453 --> 02:28:47,936
TRAVIS: It's fine!

2157
02:28:47,936 --> 02:28:54,564
SAM: What could go wrong? This is a stealth
mission. We'll be in and out of here in six

2158
02:28:54,564 --> 02:28:56,758
minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go!

2159
02:28:56,758 --> 02:29:00,768
MARISHA: Wait, are you going in? Are you
infiltrating?

2160
02:29:00,768 --> 02:29:04,316
LIAM: I'll go up and see what I see. Just above
us, not far away.

2161
02:29:04,316 --> 02:29:16,622
MARISHA: I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance
Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what

2162
02:29:16,622 --> 02:29:17,801
do you want?

2163
02:29:17,801 --> 02:29:21,861
LIAM: I'm good on that.

2164
02:29:21,861 --> 02:29:27,115
MARISHA: What do you want advantage on?

2165
02:29:27,115 --> 02:29:34,287
LIAM: Not dexterity. Constitution. I'm feeling a
little weak.

2166
02:29:34,287 --> 02:29:35,877
MARISHA: All right. Constitution.

2167
02:29:35,877 --> 02:29:37,524
MATT: What's this for?

2168
02:29:37,524 --> 02:29:49,630
MARISHA: Enhance Ability. So I think it's called
Bear's Constitution or something weird.

2169
02:29:49,690 --> 02:29:53,689
MATT: Advantage on constitution checks. Those are
different from saving throws.

2170
02:29:53,689 --> 02:29:55,858
LAURA: Oh.

2171
02:29:55,903 --> 02:29:57,185
MARISHA: Checks.

2172
02:29:57,185 --> 02:30:00,806
MATT: But it does give him 2d6 temporary hit
points, but those do not stack with the current

2173
02:30:00,806 --> 02:30:04,735
temporary hit points you have. Constitution would
not be of much benefit to you.

2174
02:30:04,735 --> 02:30:07,191
TRAVIS: We could just set a fire down here.

2175
02:30:07,191 --> 02:30:09,978
MARISHA: Okay. Do you want dex or anything?

2176
02:30:09,978 --> 02:30:13,341
LIAM: I'm pretty dex-y already.

2177
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:19,204
MARISHA: Instead, I say, good luck.

2178
02:30:19,204 --> 02:30:24,561
SAM: Bonne chance! Vive la résistance!

2179
02:30:24,561 --> 02:30:25,478
TRAVIS: All right.

2180
02:30:25,478 --> 02:30:30,566
LIAM: I'm going to check and see if it gives at
all or if there's anything to it.

2181
02:30:30,566 --> 02:30:31,911
MATT: (creak) It gives.

2182
02:30:31,911 --> 02:30:33,765
LIAM: It gives. All right, so I'm going to go up.

2183
02:30:33,765 --> 02:30:35,195
TRAVIS: Invisible or not?

2184
02:30:35,195 --> 02:30:44,044
LIAM: No, stealthing up. All right. So, okay,
hold on, I get advantage. 23.

2185
02:30:44,113 --> 02:30:48,441
LAURA: Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a
Trace.

2186
02:30:48,503 --> 02:30:49,556
LIAM: Oh, 33.

2187
02:30:49,556 --> 02:30:56,015
MATT: 33. You move it up, without a sound, dart
up, catch yourself and lower it down carefully.

2188
02:30:56,015 --> 02:30:59,955
Dark interior, you use your Flametongue Dagger to
look inside. You are inside of a closet of some

2189
02:30:59,955 --> 02:31:07,777
kind, a ten by five closet. There are coats and
outfits around you. You can push them aside. This

2190
02:31:07,777 --> 02:31:13,554
looks to be like a small storage room that has
been repurposed as a closet of some kind.

2191
02:31:13,554 --> 02:31:18,009
LIAM: I am listening intently and feeling through
as many pockets as I can find around me.

2192
02:31:18,009 --> 02:31:22,906
MATT: Easily enough. As you put your ear to the
door, they are talking immediately on the other

2193
02:31:22,906 --> 02:31:27,673
side of this door. You are a room adjacent to it.
You do manage to pocket from a few of the coats

2194
02:31:27,673 --> 02:31:32,060
about 47 gold pieces in total.

2195
02:31:32,060 --> 02:31:35,940
MARISHA: Who leaves that much in their coat
pockets?

2196
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:38,657
TRAVIS: Dead people, that's who.

2197
02:31:38,657 --> 02:31:41,744
LIAM: Can I make anything out through there?

2198
02:31:41,744 --> 02:31:48,773
MATT: You make out conversation. It seems to be
between a voice you don't recognize and the

2199
02:31:48,773 --> 02:31:54,860
gentleman earlier you met, basically saying,
"With everything that's going on now, it's honestly

2200
02:31:54,921 --> 02:32:02,710
"very frustrating that these people wouldn't do
their share of the bargain. I, myself, I've been

2201
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:07,416
"doing my best to keep them in order, but at this
point in time, I think we need to do another show

2202
02:32:07,416 --> 02:32:14,202
"of strength in order to keep them working as hard
as we have been." Another voice calms him down and

2203
02:32:14,202 --> 02:32:22,230
says, "Don't worry, don't worry. Keep it under
control. At the very least, we should have to be

2204
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:30,730
"ready, prepared. If what Lady Briarwood says, we
should be having visitors any day now. And I would

2205
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:38,668
"hate to be caught flat-footed. So, we're going to
go ahead and gather our arms, going to make sure

2206
02:32:38,668 --> 02:32:46,938
"that we outfit the place the best we can. Traps,
alarms, whatever is necessary to make sure that we

2207
02:32:46,938 --> 02:32:48,588
"are not caught off-guard."

2208
02:32:48,588 --> 02:32:50,776
(laughter)

2209
02:32:50,776 --> 02:32:52,454
MARISHA: This is about to be hilarious!

2210
02:32:52,454 --> 02:32:58,414
MATT: You guys came at just about the right time.

2211
02:32:58,483 --> 02:33:06,477
LIAM: I'd like to-- everybody hold.

2212
02:33:06,477 --> 02:33:07,971
SAM: Hold?

2213
02:33:07,971 --> 02:33:08,667
LAURA: Hold.

2214
02:33:08,667 --> 02:33:12,365
LIAM: I just want to wait for one minute and see
what progresses.

2215
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:22,406
MATT: Okay. The conversation continues. The older
gentleman begins talking about, "I don't like the

2216
02:33:22,406 --> 02:33:30,117
"idea of there being any sort of conflict on our
home turf. I wish they would just meet them out,

2217
02:33:30,197 --> 02:33:35,057
"head them off, cut them off at the head. Why did
we invite them in here? That seems to be a

2218
02:33:35,057 --> 02:33:36,535
"dangerous circumstance."

2219
02:33:36,535 --> 02:33:40,267
LIAM: While they're talking I say: we've got two
gentlemen up here.

2220
02:33:40,336 --> 02:33:41,849
SAM: Two gentlemen!

2221
02:33:41,849 --> 02:33:44,030
LAURA: Okay. I start climbing the--

2222
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:46,646
LIAM: I think it's time to start killing.

2223
02:33:46,646 --> 02:33:49,507
SAM: Grog up first!

2224
02:33:49,507 --> 02:33:51,760
MARISHA: Places everyone, places!

2225
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:53,316
LAURA: Grog up before me.

2226
02:33:53,316 --> 02:33:55,756
TRAVIS: It's opening night and I'm so excited!

2227
02:33:55,756 --> 02:33:59,145
(laughter)

2228
02:33:59,145 --> 02:34:00,501
MATT: Stealth checks all around.

2229
02:34:00,501 --> 02:34:02,396
LAURA: Plus ten!

2230
02:34:02,396 --> 02:34:05,795
LIAM: Send up the goliath.

2231
02:34:05,795 --> 02:34:07,093
MARISHA: That's good!

2232
02:34:07,093 --> 02:34:09,987
TRAVIS: 29!

2233
02:34:09,987 --> 02:34:14,561
SAM: 18.

2234
02:34:14,561 --> 02:34:15,565
LAURA: Plus ten!

2235
02:34:15,565 --> 02:34:17,013
SAM: That was plus ten.

2236
02:34:17,013 --> 02:34:18,028
MARISHA: 32.

2237
02:34:18,028 --> 02:34:19,083
TALIESIN: 28.

2238
02:34:19,083 --> 02:34:20,174
LAURA: 34.

2239
02:34:20,174 --> 02:34:24,779
MATT: All righty. You all slowly make your way up.
There's not enough room for all of you inside this

2240
02:34:24,779 --> 02:34:28,043
room, this storage space.

2241
02:34:28,043 --> 02:34:29,544
LAURA: Grog first.

2242
02:34:29,544 --> 02:34:37,704
MATT: Grog, you go up, you push open the door into
the next room and it is a-- for lack of a better

2243
02:34:37,704 --> 02:34:41,228
term, a music room. There's a few couches around,
there's a piano set up.

2244
02:34:41,228 --> 02:34:43,376
LIAM: Oh, it went closet to music room?

2245
02:34:43,376 --> 02:34:44,210
MATT: Yeah.

2246
02:34:44,210 --> 02:34:45,504
MARISHA: Oh, we're opening the door?

2247
02:34:45,504 --> 02:34:51,559
MATT: You guys are opening a door to a room next
to-- the wall you were listening to is the room

2248
02:34:51,559 --> 02:34:56,802
next to you. This opens up into a room adjacent.

2249
02:34:56,802 --> 02:34:59,722
MARISHA: A music room! How regal!

2250
02:34:59,722 --> 02:35:05,120
MATT: So, as you push out into the room, it's dark
in here. The only light that's coming in is from

2251
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:09,934
the nearby window. A little bit of sun's coming
through from the rainstorm. You can still hear the

2252
02:35:09,934 --> 02:35:17,316
rain pattering on the window and the second floor
above you, there is no sound from the rain hitting

2253
02:35:17,316 --> 02:35:18,725
the roof from this distance.

2254
02:35:18,725 --> 02:35:21,269
LIAM: Dart my eyes around. Is there anything
that's useful in here?

2255
02:35:21,269 --> 02:35:24,122
MATT: Not particularly; it's mostly decorative.
Few vases, some books on the shelf. There is a

2256
02:35:24,199 --> 02:35:27,310
door that is partially open that leads into
hallway. A hallway

2257
02:35:27,310 --> 02:35:29,322
that seems to connect the two rooms.

2258
02:35:29,322 --> 02:35:30,893
LIAM: Which way are the voices coming from?

2259
02:35:30,893 --> 02:35:39,524
MATT: Yeah. The door is the opposite of the window
and the room that you're in is adjacent to the

2260
02:35:39,524 --> 02:35:42,054
room that the voices are coming from. The closet
is in between the two.

2261
02:35:42,054 --> 02:35:45,116
LIAM: Oh, between the two. So it is out, door,
hallway?

2262
02:35:45,116 --> 02:35:50,318
MATT: Yes, out, door, hallway, and then the room
where the speaking is coming from.

2263
02:35:50,318 --> 02:35:59,646
SAM: Do you want me to create a diversion of some
sort? No?

2264
02:35:59,726 --> 02:36:01,363
LAURA: Just run in, surprise him.

2265
02:36:01,363 --> 02:36:02,478
SAM: Are we going to go around?

2266
02:36:02,478 --> 02:36:03,819
LIAM: So, we're stealthing, right?

2267
02:36:03,819 --> 02:36:04,583
MATT: Yeah.

2268
02:36:04,583 --> 02:36:07,211
LIAM: So I pull both of their hands and I say--

2269
02:36:07,211 --> 02:36:08,223
SAM: Who's they?

2270
02:36:08,223 --> 02:36:14,953
LIAM: Grog and Keyleth. I start pulling them
through-- that's all right. Out the door. Along

2271
02:36:14,953 --> 02:36:16,984
the hallway towards the voices.

2272
02:36:16,984 --> 02:36:18,361
MATT: All right.

2273
02:36:18,361 --> 02:36:20,997
TALIESIN: Matt, that's a lot of maps you have down
there.

2274
02:36:20,997 --> 02:36:27,410
LAURA: Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm
hurt.

2275
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:32,353
MARISHA: I look back at Vex and I just go--

2276
02:36:32,353 --> 02:36:35,052
LAURA: I give you the worst evil eye I've ever
given anyone.

2277
02:36:35,052 --> 02:36:37,820
LIAM: Too bad one's going that way and the other's
going that way.

2278
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:46,511
SAM: As they go, I quickly lock eyes with Grog and
I give him a quick little inspiration.

2279
02:36:46,511 --> 02:36:53,735
(singing) Blood, glorious blood! Grog's 
about to take some. Dead dudettes and dudes,

2280
02:36:53,866 --> 02:36:56,656
Grog's about to make some!

2281
02:36:56,656 --> 02:36:58,694
(laughter)

2282
02:36:58,694 --> 02:37:04,471
MATT: All right, so take a d10 inspiration die.
So, the three of you move on ahead. The rest of

2283
02:37:04,471 --> 02:37:07,064
you-- Trinket is unable to climb.

2284
02:37:07,064 --> 02:37:12,627
SAM: Oh! Can I? Trinket: stay.

2285
02:37:12,627 --> 02:37:15,441
(laughter)

2286
02:37:15,441 --> 02:37:21,432
LAURA: I smack the back of your head again. And
it's hard because I'm angry right now.

2287
02:37:21,432 --> 02:37:26,649
TRAVIS: Do you have any of your rings on? Turn
them inside and (impact noise).

2288
02:37:26,649 --> 02:37:30,413
MARISHA: It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the
grandma backhand.

2289
02:37:30,413 --> 02:37:40,414
MATT: All right, the three of you stand at the
double doors. You moved around to the hallway. Is

2290
02:37:40,414 --> 02:37:46,519
there a change to this arrangement that you would
like? You currently have Grog, Vax, and Keyleth at

2291
02:37:46,519 --> 02:37:49,169
the front, and three of you in the back.

2292
02:37:49,169 --> 02:37:52,120
LAURA: Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog
after they go into the room.

2293
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:58,228
MATT: All right, so there you are. I'll put you on the
side of the door there. You hear the voices from

2294
02:37:58,288 --> 02:38:02,950
the other side of the door conversing and talking
back and forth. Scanlan, Percy.

2295
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:06,629
MARISHA: Oh my god. Someone say something cool!

2296
02:38:06,629 --> 02:38:07,958
MATT: What's the plan?

2297
02:38:07,958 --> 02:38:10,449
LIAM: I put my hand up in the air.

2298
02:38:10,449 --> 02:38:12,496
SAM: de Rolos, roll out!

2299
02:38:12,496 --> 02:38:16,704
LIAM: And I click my boots together. (click) Feel
that adrenaline rush.

2300
02:38:16,704 --> 02:38:17,980
TRAVIS: I rage.

2301
02:38:17,980 --> 02:38:23,089
LIAM: And I kick the door as hard as I can and go
right in!

2302
02:38:23,089 --> 02:38:26,891
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and SAM: (scream and cheer)

2303
02:38:26,891 --> 02:38:32,271
MATT: (impact noise) The door swings open, both of
them slamming into the sides of these two

2304
02:38:32,271 --> 02:38:39,477
bookcases. Immediately, you see behind the desk
here and standing in the center.

2305
02:38:39,477 --> 02:38:41,288
LIAM: It's Kiefer Sutherland.

2306
02:38:41,288 --> 02:38:48,520
MATT: You see the older gentleman in these long
robes immediately spin his head and see,

2307
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:55,122
essentially, a troupe of armed villagers,
peasants, dirty faces come rushing in. all fucked

2308
02:38:55,122 --> 02:39:02,760
up eyes and all. Rushing into the room. They both
turn, looking completely caught off-guard by this.

2309
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:07,779
You do also see in the room, there are a few
guards that are just waiting off to the side.

2310
02:39:07,779 --> 02:39:09,442
There's a couch area, there's a fireplace.

2311
02:39:09,442 --> 02:39:11,611
MARISHA: Of course. Damn guards.

2312
02:39:11,611 --> 02:39:15,365
MATT: You guys get a surprise round.

2313
02:39:15,365 --> 02:39:16,673
MARISHA: That's right!

2314
02:39:16,673 --> 02:39:20,405
MATT: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative to
get the order of things here.

2315
02:39:20,405 --> 02:39:25,249
TRAVIS: Advantage on initiative because I have
that thing.

2316
02:39:25,249 --> 02:39:28,599
SAM: Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that
what it is?

2317
02:39:28,599 --> 02:39:29,953
TRAVIS: I have Feral Instinct.

2318
02:39:29,953 --> 02:39:31,090
SAM: Ooh!

2319
02:39:31,090 --> 02:39:35,637
TRAVIS: Which I forget sometimes. That's better.

2320
02:39:35,706 --> 02:39:45,291
SAM and LAURA: (sing with the battle music)

2321
02:39:45,291 --> 02:39:47,381
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20?

2322
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:49,147
TRAVIS: 20!

2323
02:39:49,147 --> 02:39:51,513
TALIESIN: 23.

2324
02:39:51,513 --> 02:39:57,646
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

2325
02:39:57,646 --> 02:39:59,107
SAM: 16!

2326
02:39:59,107 --> 02:40:01,550
LAURA: Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan!

2327
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:04,971
SAM: Better figure out what I'm going to do!

2328
02:40:04,971 --> 02:40:14,959
MATT: So, Scanlan is 16. 15 to ten?

2329
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:16,036
LIAM: 13.

2330
02:40:16,036 --> 02:40:16,975
LAURA: 13.

2331
02:40:16,975 --> 02:40:18,149
MARISHA: 13.

2332
02:40:18,149 --> 02:40:21,775
LIAM: Half-elves!

2333
02:40:21,775 --> 02:40:26,982
MATT: Ten to five? Is that everyone?

2334
02:40:26,982 --> 02:40:28,295
LAURA: That's all of us.

2335
02:40:28,295 --> 02:40:29,476
MATT: That's everyone, yeah.

2336
02:40:29,476 --> 02:40:30,871
MARISHA: Bitches gonna die!

2337
02:40:30,871 --> 02:40:35,485
MATT: All righty! First, surprise round from all
of you guys, catching them off-guard.

2338
02:40:35,485 --> 02:40:37,453
Up first is Percy.

2339
02:40:37,453 --> 02:40:38,703
MARISHA: Percy!

2340
02:40:38,703 --> 02:40:44,448
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull into that empty-- Oh,
I've got a button, don't I? I'm going to pull into

2341
02:40:44,448 --> 02:40:45,713
that corner right there?

2342
02:40:45,713 --> 02:40:46,987
MATT: Over here?

2343
02:40:46,987 --> 02:40:52,908
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take two shots at that
soldier in the corner, that guard.

2344
02:40:52,963 --> 02:41:03,244
MATT: Okay. The guards, you can see, are wearing
dark studded leather armor, no cloaks. Both have

2345
02:41:03,244 --> 02:41:10,959
rapiers or stilettos, daggers on their sides. They
look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for

2346
02:41:10,959 --> 02:41:13,337
their weapons. You caught them off guard.

2347
02:41:13,337 --> 02:41:14,412
TALIESIN: 22.

2348
02:41:14,412 --> 02:41:15,875
MATT: 22 does hit.

2349
02:41:15,875 --> 02:41:28,406
TALIESIN: That's just a d10, where are my d10s?
That's nine points of damage.

2350
02:41:28,406 --> 02:41:29,438
MATT: All righty.

2351
02:41:29,438 --> 02:41:31,479
TALIESIN: Another shot to him.

2352
02:41:31,479 --> 02:41:32,984
MATT: All righty.

2353
02:41:32,984 --> 02:41:47,066
TALIESIN: That's a misfire. I'm going to do a
quick repair. And that's fine.

2354
02:41:47,066 --> 02:41:48,778
MATT: Does the repair take an action?

2355
02:41:48,778 --> 02:41:50,142
TALIESIN: No, it takes a--

2356
02:41:50,142 --> 02:41:57,613
MATT: Okay, so you're fine. It does not break.
Cool. That's your turn. One shot off. The blast

2357
02:41:57,613 --> 02:42:04,886
rings out. As you fire the pepperbox, it misfires,
and you quickly throw one of your tools in the

2358
02:42:04,886 --> 02:42:10,617
air, catch it, and with one swift movement you
unblock the passageway, click it back up into its

2359
02:42:10,617 --> 02:42:18,571
place. Out of the corner of your eye, you turn,
and for the first time in five years, you see,

2360
02:42:18,571 --> 02:42:22,959
standing behind the desk, Sir Kerrion Stonefell.
Visually, nearly the same as the last day you saw,

2361
02:42:22,959 --> 02:42:30,052
except maybe a bit of white on the sides of
the hair. Armored with a nice set of relatively

2362
02:42:30,052 --> 02:42:38,249
ornate leather armor, blue hues and blacks. The
hair itself is this tousled brown. There's a

2363
02:42:38,249 --> 02:42:45,306
boyish charisma to him, if he wasn't such an
asshole. And the moment you see him, there's this

2364
02:42:45,306 --> 02:42:49,688
boiling rage from within just to have that moment
of sight.

2365
02:42:49,688 --> 02:42:51,888
TALIESIN: If you're lucky, you die last.

2366
02:42:51,888 --> 02:42:58,912
MATT: There's a look of complete confusion, as he
has no idea who any of you are. You look like

2367
02:42:58,980 --> 02:43:04,291
paupers that literally burst into his office. That
ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

2368
02:43:04,321 --> 02:43:08,607
TRAVIS: I hear him say that he has to die last,
and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the

2369
02:43:08,607 --> 02:43:12,707
middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand
Warhammer at him twice!

2370
02:43:12,707 --> 02:43:14,469
MATT: All righty!

2371
02:43:14,469 --> 02:43:20,752
TRAVIS: I would make to make this first one a new
feat called Great Weapon Master.

2372
02:43:20,752 --> 02:43:23,073
MATT: All righty!

2373
02:43:23,073 --> 02:43:24,197
SAM: What does that do?

2374
02:43:24,197 --> 02:43:25,346
MATT: Minus five to hit.

2375
02:43:25,346 --> 02:43:29,024
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my-- no, not on that one.
That misses.

2376
02:43:29,024 --> 02:43:30,836
MATT: What did you roll?

2377
02:43:30,836 --> 02:43:37,223
TRAVIS: A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses.

2378
02:43:37,223 --> 02:43:42,157
MATT: That definitely misses. As you swing in,
(nervous yell) just ducks out of the way, and even

2379
02:43:42,157 --> 02:43:46,756
though he's older, he reacted pretty quickly. Your
weapon slams into the ground, splintering some of

2380
02:43:46,756 --> 02:43:48,941
the wood. You peel back for a second attack.

2381
02:43:48,941 --> 02:43:59,317
TRAVIS: That makes me even angrier. And now I'll
use inspiration. 18... minus five, 23!

2382
02:43:59,317 --> 02:44:01,839
MATT: 23 does hit! Plus ten damage.

2383
02:44:01,839 --> 02:44:10,531
TRAVIS: Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27!

2384
02:44:10,531 --> 02:44:13,384
MATT: 27 points of damage, ooh!

2385
02:44:13,384 --> 02:44:19,816
TRAVIS: Plus four for the fire damage, but still
the 27 total.

2386
02:44:19,816 --> 02:44:25,923
MATT: So, as he ducks out of the way, you bring up
the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him

2387
02:44:25,923 --> 02:44:30,661
right square in the chest. (grunts) The wind
escapes him for a moment and the flames lick

2388
02:44:30,785 --> 02:44:35,513
across the front of his chest. He catches himself
on the table between the sofa and chair behind

2389
02:44:35,513 --> 02:44:41,227
him. Gets back on his feet. Looks to you for a
second and pulls out two short swords.

2390
02:44:41,227 --> 02:44:45,683
TRAVIS: That's the best thing you could have ever
done.

2391
02:44:45,838 --> 02:44:49,185
MATT: "I don't know who you are, but you're going
to regret this!"

2392
02:44:49,185 --> 02:44:51,800
LAURA: What does Grog look like?

2393
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:58,508
MATT: Grog looks like an oafish butcher. Tubby on
the sides, an oldish, middle-aged looking man.

2394
02:44:58,508 --> 02:45:04,570
Scruffy beard. Scanlan does his best on that one.
Whatever other visual you want to--

2395
02:45:04,570 --> 02:45:05,585
SAM: Potbelly.

2396
02:45:05,585 --> 02:45:08,531
MATT: Huge potbelly. Grog, that ends your turn?

2397
02:45:08,531 --> 02:45:09,439
TRAVIS: Yep.

2398
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:18,333
MATT: All right. In theory, it is a surprise
round. So you may have had advantage on that

2399
02:45:18,404 --> 02:45:20,434
first strike, so go ahead and roll it.

2400
02:45:20,434 --> 02:45:27,668
TRAVIS: (screams) 26. Minus five is 21.

2401
02:45:27,668 --> 02:45:29,871
LAURA: 23. No, you're right.

2402
02:45:29,871 --> 02:45:31,162
TRAVIS: Yeah. 21.

2403
02:45:31,162 --> 02:45:35,762
MATT: Roll damage again. We'll say this is an
additional third strike in reaction to him pulling

2404
02:45:35,762 --> 02:45:40,458
his blades out.

2405
02:45:40,525 --> 02:45:42,597
TRAVIS: 32.

2406
02:45:42,597 --> 02:45:44,460
SAM: Jesus! God!

2407
02:45:44,460 --> 02:45:50,338
MATT: (wham) The hammer slams him a second time
and he almost drops his weapons. The actual end

2408
02:45:50,410 --> 02:45:55,384
table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he,
(grunts) has to get back up onto his feet. Looking

2409
02:45:55,384 --> 02:45:58,332
genuinely fearful now. That ends your turn.

2410
02:45:58,332 --> 02:45:59,751
TRAVIS: You dropped your toothpicks.

2411
02:45:59,751 --> 02:46:00,983
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2412
02:46:00,983 --> 02:46:03,305
SAM: Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy.

2413
02:46:03,305 --> 02:46:04,211
MATT: Correct.

2414
02:46:04,211 --> 02:46:08,556
SAM: Those two flanking the big boss are just
guards, right?

2415
02:46:08,556 --> 02:46:10,925
They're just standard-issue guards?

2416
02:46:10,925 --> 02:46:16,300
MATT: Best you can tell, they're both in studded
leather armor. They don't look like guards, like

2417
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:19,231
armored, they look like thugs that are essentially
there to watch.

2418
02:46:19,231 --> 02:46:21,941
SAM: All right, well, I'm going to run in the
room.

2419
02:46:21,941 --> 02:46:24,291
MATT: About how far in?

2420
02:46:24,291 --> 02:46:31,473
SAM: Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from
the action. And then I'll look at the guard

2421
02:46:31,473 --> 02:46:35,534
behind and to the right of the big guy.

2422
02:46:35,578 --> 02:46:36,702
MATT: That guy there.

2423
02:46:36,702 --> 02:46:38,363
SAM: The good guy-- the bad guy.

2424
02:46:38,363 --> 02:46:40,415
MARISHA: You got it.

2425
02:46:40,415 --> 02:46:42,442
MATT: That guy there?

2426
02:46:42,442 --> 02:46:45,194
SAM: No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate
him.

2427
02:46:45,194 --> 02:46:48,745
MARISHA: Is that also a guard? There are three
guards?

2428
02:46:48,826 --> 02:46:50,221
TALIESIN: There are three guards.

2429
02:46:50,221 --> 02:46:51,823
MATT: All right, you're going to attempt to
Dominate Person.

2430
02:46:51,823 --> 02:46:57,486
SAM: Yes. I pull up my hand cone and I say,
(singing) You're as cold as ice! Willing to

2431
02:46:57,486 --> 02:47:02,432
sacrifice your boss! And so I tell him to kill his
boss.

2432
02:47:02,432 --> 02:47:04,513
(laughter)

2433
02:47:04,513 --> 02:47:05,996
MATT: What's the DC on that?

2434
02:47:05,996 --> 02:47:07,025
SAM: 19.

2435
02:47:07,025 --> 02:47:08,732
MATT: Wisdom. He rolled a 17. That's a fail.

2436
02:47:08,732 --> 02:47:09,797
TRAVIS: Yes!

2437
02:47:09,797 --> 02:47:13,177
MATT: He is currently Dominated by Scanlan.

2438
02:47:13,177 --> 02:47:14,483
TRAVIS: (singing) Cold as ice!

2439
02:47:14,483 --> 02:47:22,961
MATT: Good to know. So, as he pulls his heavy
crossbow out, loads it, and aims it towards you,

2440
02:47:22,961 --> 02:47:29,553
looks over his shoulder for a second, and trains
it on his boss. Sir Kerrion looking confused by

2441
02:47:29,553 --> 02:47:30,963
this whole circumstance.

2442
02:47:30,963 --> 02:47:32,078
MARISHA: Cool.

2443
02:47:32,078 --> 02:47:33,681
MATT: That ends your turn?

2444
02:47:33,681 --> 02:47:34,757
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

2445
02:47:34,757 --> 02:47:39,163
MATT: All right. Keyleth, Vax, and Vex, take your
surprise rounds now.

2446
02:47:39,163 --> 02:47:43,443
LAURA: Can I go first so I don't do any damage to
you guys if you guys go in?

2447
02:47:43,443 --> 02:47:45,353
MARISHA: I'm also probably going to do a ranged
spell.

2448
02:47:45,353 --> 02:47:48,605
LIAM: What are you guys talking about? Kill him!

2449
02:47:48,605 --> 02:47:55,362
LAURA: I want to go in, peek my head in and
shoot-- first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow

2450
02:47:55,362 --> 02:48:02,961
of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use-- it turns
into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's

2451
02:48:02,961 --> 02:48:05,154
three more attacks, potentially?

2452
02:48:05,154 --> 02:48:09,582
MATT: Well, it's two additional attacks against
the one arrow. So you'd get four attacks in one

2453
02:48:09,582 --> 02:48:11,113
round, essentially.

2454
02:48:11,113 --> 02:48:12,004
SAM: Good god!

2455
02:48:12,004 --> 02:48:17,532
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to
attack him, the guy.

2456
02:48:17,532 --> 02:48:18,764
MATT: Which guy?

2457
02:48:18,764 --> 02:48:20,026
LAURA: The bad guy.

2458
02:48:20,026 --> 02:48:21,719
MATT: There's two bad guys in there.

2459
02:48:21,719 --> 02:48:23,873
LAURA: The one that's in charge. Kerrion.

2460
02:48:23,873 --> 02:48:25,156
MATT: Sir Kerrion? All right, go for it.

2461
02:48:25,156 --> 02:48:28,322
LAURA: Yeah! 28.

2462
02:48:28,322 --> 02:48:29,315
MATT: 28 hits.

2463
02:48:29,315 --> 02:48:32,827
LAURA: Okay, so I make an attack for all three
arrows.

2464
02:48:32,827 --> 02:48:38,443
MATT: Correct. That was one of them. You fire it,
it splits into three along the way, and you roll

2465
02:48:38,443 --> 02:48:39,856
for each attack on each arrow.

2466
02:48:39,856 --> 02:48:44,828
LAURA: Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably
not. 13?

2467
02:48:44,828 --> 02:48:45,905
MATT: No.

2468
02:48:45,905 --> 02:48:48,841
LAURA: 18?

2469
02:48:48,841 --> 02:48:51,199
MATT: 18 unfortunately does not hit, either.

2470
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:53,972
LAURA: Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm
arrow.

2471
02:48:53,972 --> 02:48:57,215
MATT: And you still get a fourth attack with your
second--

2472
02:48:57,215 --> 02:48:58,183
LAURA: Yes.

2473
02:48:58,183 --> 02:49:00,290
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark?

2474
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:06,915
LAURA: That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm
going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one

2475
02:49:06,915 --> 02:49:08,853
because it's a bonus action.

2476
02:49:08,853 --> 02:49:10,204
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

2477
02:49:10,204 --> 02:49:20,596
LAURA: What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus
another d6, so it's

2478
02:49:20,596 --> 02:49:24,010
basically like Hunter's Mark, right?

2479
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:26,337
TRAVIS: Nobody knows what you're doing.

2480
02:49:26,337 --> 02:49:34,552
(laughter)

2481
02:49:34,641 --> 02:49:36,417
MATT: So the first arrow does an additional
lightning damage.

2482
02:49:36,486 --> 02:49:43,720
LAURA: 19 is the first one. And then I attack
again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I

2483
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:44,834
do that?

2484
02:49:44,834 --> 02:49:51,305
MATT: You haven't used your bonus action, so yes
you can. Two eyes going all--

2485
02:49:51,305 --> 02:49:52,812
LAURA: 29.

2486
02:49:52,812 --> 02:49:54,364
MATT: 29 does hit, yes.

2487
02:49:54,364 --> 02:49:57,164
LAURA: I'm so confused right now.

2488
02:49:57,164 --> 02:49:58,455
LIAM: Us, too.

2489
02:49:58,455 --> 02:50:02,416
LAURA: I know. 14 on the second one.

2490
02:50:02,416 --> 02:50:09,691
MATT: Okay, gotcha. So your arrows split, two of
them embedding into the actual desk itself and

2491
02:50:09,691 --> 02:50:14,193
exploding with a burst of electricity. A third one
strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick

2492
02:50:14,193 --> 02:50:18,763
in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second. He
backs up a little bit, catching himself on the

2493
02:50:18,763 --> 02:50:22,353
edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and
strikes him in the shoulder. He cuts off the shaft

2494
02:50:22,353 --> 02:50:25,952
of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and
frustration.

2495
02:50:25,952 --> 02:50:31,600
LAURA: I totally shit the bed on that one, guys,
and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do.

2496
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:37,027
SAM: After she does that, I say: that was my
grandma!

2497
02:50:37,027 --> 02:50:38,680
(laughter)

2498
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:40,073
LAURA: That's right, boy!

2499
02:50:40,073 --> 02:50:41,067
MATT: This little boy.

2500
02:50:41,067 --> 02:50:42,257
TRAVIS: Adding to the confusion.

2501
02:50:42,257 --> 02:50:49,941
MATT: Do you want to move at all? You would've had
to move into the room to do that shot because you

2502
02:50:49,941 --> 02:50:51,271
were outside in the hallway.

2503
02:50:51,271 --> 02:50:52,222
LAURA: Huh?

2504
02:50:52,222 --> 02:50:53,911
MATT: You were in the hallway when that happened,
so I'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot

2505
02:50:53,911 --> 02:50:55,143
them. Where would you want to be?

2506
02:50:55,143 --> 02:50:56,505
LAURA: Oh, just right inside the door.

2507
02:50:56,505 --> 02:50:57,610
MATT: Right there in the door?

2508
02:50:57,610 --> 02:50:59,936
MARISHA: What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion
wearing?

2509
02:50:59,936 --> 02:51:04,659
MATT: Best you can tell, it looks like a very high
quality studded leather.

2510
02:51:04,659 --> 02:51:06,039
MARISHA: Studded leather?

2511
02:51:06,039 --> 02:51:06,984
MATT: Yeah.

2512
02:51:06,984 --> 02:51:07,888
MARISHA: Okay.

2513
02:51:07,888 --> 02:51:12,363
LAURA: Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then
went back around the side of the door?

2514
02:51:12,363 --> 02:51:14,806
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

2515
02:51:14,806 --> 02:51:15,728
LAURA: Yeah.

2516
02:51:15,728 --> 02:51:18,766
TRAVIS: Keyleth, Vax.

2517
02:51:18,766 --> 02:51:20,171
LIAM: Is it up to us?

2518
02:51:20,171 --> 02:51:22,268
MATT: You guys are the last ones to go.

2519
02:51:22,268 --> 02:51:23,312
LIAM: Go.

2520
02:51:23,312 --> 02:51:32,654
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning.
And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go.

2521
02:51:32,654 --> 02:51:40,243
This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this
guard so they both have to save from it.

2522
02:51:40,243 --> 02:51:42,118
SAM: Take that, Sir Korea!

2523
02:51:42,118 --> 02:51:43,681
MARISHA: Yeah!

2524
02:51:43,681 --> 02:51:47,105
TALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell.

2525
02:51:47,105 --> 02:51:50,944
MATT: As a thing of note, a storm cloud appears in
the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with

2526
02:51:50,944 --> 02:51:55,907
a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see
in the air.

2527
02:51:55,907 --> 02:51:57,399
MARISHA: Oh, so it's going to--

2528
02:51:57,399 --> 02:51:59,213
MATT: The room won't fit it, unfortunately.

2529
02:51:59,213 --> 02:52:00,889
MARISHA: The room won't fit my storm cloud?

2530
02:52:00,889 --> 02:52:04,317
TALIESIN: That sounds like a great song.

2531
02:52:04,317 --> 02:52:09,092
MATT: It says if you're in a room that can't
accommodate the cloud, it can't appear.

2532
02:52:09,092 --> 02:52:12,839
MARISHA: Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then.

2533
02:52:12,839 --> 02:52:14,903
MATT: If you want to consider your next move, Vax
can go.

2534
02:52:14,903 --> 02:52:16,051
MARISHA: Yeah, go Vax.

2535
02:52:16,051 --> 02:52:23,471
LIAM: I am running straight towards
what's-his-name, Kerrion? Is at the desk, so I

2536
02:52:23,471 --> 02:52:28,399
just run right towards the desk, I step against
the desk, leap up in the air and go

2537
02:52:28,399 --> 02:52:30,697
(stabbing sound) into his shoulders.

2538
02:52:30,697 --> 02:52:31,746
MATT: Right there?

2539
02:52:31,746 --> 02:52:36,161
LIAM: Yeah, no, I'm on the desk in front of him,
going for his chest.

2540
02:52:36,161 --> 02:52:37,608
MATT: Go for it.

2541
02:52:37,608 --> 02:52:47,941
LIAM: First, and I get advantage on everything is
a-- It's a 30! And this is surprise attack, so

2542
02:52:47,941 --> 02:52:54,038
it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage.
This guy is going down! One plus seven is eight--

2543
02:52:54,038 --> 02:52:55,620
what gets doubled?

2544
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:57,390
MATT: Just the dice.

2545
02:52:57,390 --> 02:52:59,699
LIAM: Just the dice? But not the sneak attack
damage?

2546
02:52:59,776 --> 02:53:03,010
MATT: No, the sneak attack damage, as well, but
just the modifiers don't get doubled.

2547
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:16,430
LIAM: Okay. So that was-- okay, two plus seven is
nine. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 18, 23, 29, 33, 66 for

2548
02:53:16,430 --> 02:53:18,359
the first attack, darling.

2549
02:53:18,359 --> 02:53:19,377
SAM: 66?!

2550
02:53:19,377 --> 02:53:22,606
LIAM: 66! Here comes the second dagger into him at
advantage.

2551
02:53:22,606 --> 02:53:24,053
MARISHA: 66?!

2552
02:53:24,053 --> 02:53:25,478
MATT: Surprise rounds.

2553
02:53:25,478 --> 02:53:35,356
LIAM: Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is
seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is

2554
02:53:35,356 --> 02:53:42,919
29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass,
that's an eight. (stabbing noises)

2555
02:53:42,919 --> 02:53:47,466
SAM: That's 15, is 70-- is 81.

2556
02:53:47,466 --> 02:53:52,862
MATT: Yep. 81 points of damage in one round of
combat. As you land on the desk, your daggers

2557
02:53:52,862 --> 02:53:58,158
bypass the armor and they find their way through
the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles

2558
02:53:58,158 --> 02:54:03,223
into the deep portion of the chest. He (choking
noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and

2559
02:54:03,223 --> 02:54:10,957
blood splatters up from his throat. He reaches up
and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the

2560
02:54:10,957 --> 02:54:15,801
wound. You see a gout of blood pour from the wound
as you reach back and stab him a third time with

2561
02:54:15,801 --> 02:54:20,147
the dagger as you catch yourself on
the desk. He reaches up and kicks you, forcing you

2562
02:54:20,223 --> 02:54:25,529
to get back on your feet with your daggers at
the ready. The blood's beginning to pour. It's not

2563
02:54:25,529 --> 02:54:31,072
a mortal wound, but it's looking really bad for
him. He's not on death's door, but that definitely

2564
02:54:31,072 --> 02:54:33,064
took him down a few pegs.

2565
02:54:33,064 --> 02:54:35,543
LIAM: I give him a Vex wink.

2566
02:54:35,543 --> 02:54:42,361
MATT: (laughs) He looks at you and growls. Draws
two rapiers from his side.

2567
02:54:42,428 --> 02:54:43,488
TRAVIS: Two rapiers?

2568
02:54:43,488 --> 02:54:44,744
MATT: Yeah.

2569
02:54:44,744 --> 02:54:49,243
MARISHA: He draws two rapiers? Do we get any
indication by what we just saw if he might be a

2570
02:54:49,243 --> 02:54:50,677
vampire or something?

2571
02:54:50,677 --> 02:54:53,670
MATT: Make an insight check.

2572
02:54:53,670 --> 02:55:01,377
MARISHA: I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah!
27.

2573
02:55:01,377 --> 02:55:05,797
MATT: 27. Nothing yet has given away any sort of
essence of that.

2574
02:55:05,797 --> 02:55:07,674
He doesn't look particularly pale.

2575
02:55:07,674 --> 02:55:11,075
TALIESIN: He's also aged. He's a bit peppered.

2576
02:55:11,143 --> 02:55:13,174
MARISHA: Yeah, he has aged.

2577
02:55:13,174 --> 02:55:16,514
MATT: He definitely looks wounded and unhappy.

2578
02:55:16,514 --> 02:55:18,139
LIAM: Can I ask a technical question?

2579
02:55:18,139 --> 02:55:19,135
MATT: Sure.

2580
02:55:19,135 --> 02:55:23,981
LIAM: According to Assassinate, any hit I score
against a creature that is surprised is a critical

2581
02:55:23,981 --> 02:55:27,041
hit. Any hit. So are the two subsequent attacks--

2582
02:55:27,041 --> 02:55:28,368
MATT: After the first hit--

2583
02:55:28,368 --> 02:55:33,755
LIAM: That's sneak attack. This says, "in
addition, any hit you score against a creature

2584
02:55:33,755 --> 02:55:36,073
"that is surprised is a critical hit."

2585
02:55:36,073 --> 02:55:39,524
MATT: Right. Okay.

2586
02:55:39,524 --> 02:55:42,880
SAM: Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first
one.

2587
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:46,322
MATT: I'm usually under the impression that after
the first hit, they're no longer surprised. They

2588
02:55:46,322 --> 02:55:47,331
know you're there.

2589
02:55:47,331 --> 02:55:49,501
LIAM: Okay. Okay. Got it.

2590
02:55:49,501 --> 02:55:51,993
TRAVIS: (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?!

2591
02:55:51,993 --> 02:55:57,549
LIAM: Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds
apart, so I thought it was so fast.

2592
02:55:57,549 --> 02:55:58,836
MATT: That's true. I'll allow it.

2593
02:55:58,836 --> 02:55:59,889
TRAVIS: Oh!

2594
02:55:59,889 --> 02:56:01,157
TALIESIN: What?!

2595
02:56:01,157 --> 02:56:02,266
TRAVIS: Double what?

2596
02:56:02,266 --> 02:56:06,307
LIAM: Double the last two attacks. Which were much
less.

2597
02:56:06,307 --> 02:56:08,122
SAM: It was 15, so it becomes 30.

2598
02:56:08,122 --> 02:56:18,246
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, he's not happy. Really
not happy. Okay. All right. That ends your turn.

2599
02:56:18,305 --> 02:56:20,301
Keyleth, what are you doing?

2600
02:56:20,301 --> 02:56:29,361
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to do some fun shit.
So seeing Vax go up and get next to Lord Kerrion

2601
02:56:29,361 --> 02:56:36,069
or whatever the shit his name is. I'm going to go
and turn into a dire wolf this time. Mixing it up

2602
02:56:36,069 --> 02:56:37,345
from Minxie.

2603
02:56:37,345 --> 02:56:38,525
TALIESIN: That's like a normal wolf.

2604
02:56:38,525 --> 02:56:39,704
MARISHA: But slightly bigger.

2605
02:56:39,704 --> 02:56:40,547
TALIESIN: But dire.

2606
02:56:40,547 --> 02:56:44,587
MARISHA: But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from
the mountains that I'm from.

2607
02:56:44,587 --> 02:56:50,487
MATT: You are now filling up the entirety of the
double-door frame right now.

2608
02:56:50,487 --> 02:57:00,310
MARISHA: I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics
and flank Lord Kerrion.

2609
02:57:00,310 --> 02:57:08,117
MATT: At your size, you can't quite get to him,
unfortunately. You can try and move around this

2610
02:57:08,117 --> 02:57:12,716
way, maybe. You will probably take an attack of
opportunity from this guy, but you can try and

2611
02:57:12,716 --> 02:57:13,668
move around.

2612
02:57:13,668 --> 02:57:15,611
MARISHA: Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's
do it.

2613
02:57:15,611 --> 02:57:16,684
MATT: What's your movement?

2614
02:57:16,684 --> 02:57:18,843
MARISHA: 50 feet.

2615
02:57:18,843 --> 02:57:23,596
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. You move around and
you get over there.

2616
02:57:23,596 --> 02:57:25,264
MARISHA: Is that flanking?

2617
02:57:25,264 --> 02:57:37,842
MATT: It's not flanking, no. Yeah, it's not
flanking per se. I mean, you're adjacent to him.

2618
02:57:37,842 --> 02:57:40,255
You'd have to be on opposite sides to flank.

2619
02:57:40,255 --> 02:57:45,401
MARISHA: I know, that's what I was trying to get.
All right. Well, then, since Vax has that guy,

2620
02:57:45,401 --> 02:57:47,778
I'll go for this guy. Take him out.

2621
02:57:47,778 --> 02:57:50,346
MATT: Okay. So you move into that guy there.

2622
02:57:50,346 --> 02:57:52,379
MARISHA: Okay.

2623
02:57:52,379 --> 02:57:56,387
SAM: That is the most peasant-looking direwolf
ever.

2624
02:57:56,387 --> 02:57:59,549
MATT: Yeah, this little peasant girl just went
(growls).

2625
02:57:59,549 --> 02:58:02,368
MARISHA: Ooh, that was a 19 to hit.

2626
02:58:02,368 --> 02:58:04,266
MATT: That'll hit.

2627
02:58:04,266 --> 02:58:15,058
MARISHA: Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great,
four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and

2628
02:58:15,058 --> 02:58:22,242
then do I also-- oh, and he has to make a DC 13
strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

2629
02:58:22,242 --> 02:58:24,652
MATT: He rolled a 12.

2630
02:58:24,652 --> 02:58:26,991
MARISHA: (cheers) So he's down.

2631
02:58:26,991 --> 02:58:28,652
MATT: He's knocked prone. How much damage was it?

2632
02:58:28,652 --> 02:58:30,788
MARISHA: Not a lot. What did I say, six?

2633
02:58:30,788 --> 02:58:32,391
MATT: Six points of piercing damage?

2634
02:58:32,391 --> 02:58:33,269
MARISHA: Yes.

2635
02:58:33,269 --> 02:58:36,787
MATT: He's knocked prone. (impact sound) Falls on
the ground.

2636
02:58:36,787 --> 02:58:40,343
MARISHA: Do I get my fiery stuff for that?

2637
02:58:40,343 --> 02:58:42,371
MATT: What attack was it? Was it bite?

2638
02:58:42,371 --> 02:58:43,167
MARISHA: Bite.

2639
02:58:43,167 --> 02:58:43,972
MATT: No.

2640
02:58:43,972 --> 02:58:45,467
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, he's down.

2641
02:58:45,467 --> 02:58:46,494
MATT: All right. Is that your turn?

2642
02:58:46,494 --> 02:58:47,364
MARISHA: Yep.

2643
02:58:47,364 --> 02:58:52,496
MATT: All right. That ends the surprise round. Now
we're at the top again. Percy, you're up.

2644
02:58:52,496 --> 02:59:00,833
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one step forward. I'm
going to shoot that guard once, one more time.

2645
02:59:00,833 --> 02:59:01,949
MATT: The one over here?

2646
02:59:01,949 --> 02:59:02,681
TALIESIN: Yep.

2647
02:59:02,681 --> 02:59:03,604
MATT: All righty.

2648
02:59:03,604 --> 02:59:11,682
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm going to try sharpshooter.
And that's 14, 15, 21 to hit?

2649
02:59:11,682 --> 02:59:12,736
MATT: 21 hits.

2650
02:59:12,736 --> 02:59:23,260
TALIESIN: That'll do 19 points of damage.
Actually, that's more than 19 points, because it's

2651
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:28,187
a fire shot, so 19 plus two, so 21 points, with
two points of fire damage in there.

2652
02:59:28,187 --> 02:59:31,590
MATT: 21 points of damage. All right, (gunshot
sound) you fire. There's a burst of flame that

2653
02:59:31,590 --> 02:59:35,324
gouts out the side of the pepperbox, (impact sound)
blasting into the chest of the guard off to the

2654
02:59:35,324 --> 02:59:38,532
side. He's thrown against the wall from the sheer
force of it. Reaches down and grabs his chest and

2655
02:59:38,532 --> 02:59:41,632
looks at it, and you can see there's this red
crimson across his hand, as you've actually blown

2656
02:59:41,632 --> 02:59:46,011
a piece of his leather armor open and you can see
the wound in his chest. There's a little bit of

2657
02:59:46,011 --> 02:59:49,300
blood trickling out of his mouth, and he
looks angry at you.

2658
02:59:49,300 --> 02:59:51,611
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him again.

2659
02:59:51,661 --> 02:59:53,493
(laughter)

2660
02:59:53,493 --> 02:59:55,111
TALIESIN: That's 17.

2661
02:59:55,111 --> 02:59:56,333
MATT: 17 hits.

2662
02:59:56,333 --> 02:59:57,478
MARISHA: Nice.

2663
02:59:57,478 --> 03:00:01,173
TALIESIN: That's 21 points of damage.

2664
03:00:01,173 --> 03:00:06,303
MATT: 21 points of damage, nice. (gunshot) You
blast him, this time on the other side of the

2665
03:00:06,303 --> 03:00:09,981
shoulder, you can see now this armor is now torn
open exposing the wound here and his arm's now

2666
03:00:09,981 --> 03:00:13,697
hanging to one side. He's (grunts). He's looking
in severe pain and

2667
03:00:13,697 --> 03:00:15,813
barely hanging on at this point.

2668
03:00:15,813 --> 03:00:18,706
TALIESIN: Fall, damn it. Shooting him again.

2669
03:00:18,706 --> 03:00:19,772
MARISHA: Kill him!

2670
03:00:19,772 --> 03:00:29,540
TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit.

2671
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:31,487
MATT: 20 to hit. It hits.

2672
03:00:31,487 --> 03:00:34,501
TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.

2673
03:00:34,501 --> 03:00:40,025
MATT: Eight points of damage. All right, this is
the final one as he's looking at himself; he's

2674
03:00:40,025 --> 03:00:42,773
like (pained noises), angrily looks at you, picks
his crossbow up and aims it at you. Before he gets

2675
03:00:42,773 --> 03:00:46,160
a chance to, you aim your third shot, (gunshot)
firing, hitting him right in the center of the

2676
03:00:46,213 --> 03:00:51,246
head, (impact noise) blasting out part of his
face, his body spins, and then he falls over into

2677
03:00:51,246 --> 03:00:53,706
the plant in the corner, slumped over it there.

2678
03:00:53,706 --> 03:00:59,645
TALIESIN: I finish walking almost into the corner
over there, right next to him, about there. Spend

2679
03:00:59,645 --> 03:01:03,286
an action surge, taking three more shots at
Kerrion.

2680
03:01:03,286 --> 03:01:04,152
SAM: Whoa.

2681
03:01:04,152 --> 03:01:05,276
MARISHA: Yeah!

2682
03:01:05,276 --> 03:01:06,212
SAM: Damn.

2683
03:01:06,212 --> 03:01:09,298
TALIESIN: This is a sharpshooter round.

2684
03:01:09,298 --> 03:01:10,372
MATT: Okay.

2685
03:01:10,372 --> 03:01:14,664
TALIESIN: That's 19, 26 to hit.

2686
03:01:14,664 --> 03:01:15,738
MATT: 26 hits.

2687
03:01:15,738 --> 03:01:16,827
MARISHA: Do you crit on a 19?

2688
03:01:16,827 --> 03:01:17,953
TALIESIN: I don't crit on a 19.

2689
03:01:17,953 --> 03:01:18,938
MARISHA: Fuck!

2690
03:01:18,938 --> 03:01:27,485
TALIESIN: Oh, that'll do. 24 points of damage plus
a point of ice damage. So, 25 points of damage.

2691
03:01:27,485 --> 03:01:30,314
MATT: Plus an additional d6 points of damage for
that.

2692
03:01:30,314 --> 03:01:34,747
TALIESIN: Yay! Because he's an asshole. That's six
more points of damage.

2693
03:01:34,747 --> 03:01:41,340
MATT: So, as you go around and fire from the
barrel, the shot fires out. And as you recoil you

2694
03:01:41,340 --> 03:01:46,772
guys, for those who are noticing off to the side,
this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of

2695
03:01:46,772 --> 03:01:53,300
Percy's body, out of his eyes and his ears and the
hand on the gun. There's black smoke beginning to

2696
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:56,198
emit from his body and beginning to envelop the
gun arm.

2697
03:01:56,198 --> 03:01:58,869
SAM: What?

2698
03:01:58,933 --> 03:02:00,778
MARISHA: We all see this?

2699
03:02:00,778 --> 03:02:03,573
MATT: For those who are paying attention, which
right now would be pretty much just

2700
03:02:03,573 --> 03:02:05,768
Scanlan and Vex.

2701
03:02:05,768 --> 03:02:07,751
SAM: You're weird.

2702
03:02:07,751 --> 03:02:11,404
TALIESIN: So you don't see shit. Shut up.

2703
03:02:11,404 --> 03:02:13,693
MARISHA: I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's
throat.

2704
03:02:13,693 --> 03:02:19,208
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a quick reload, and
I'm going to fire again, with Sharpshooter, and

2705
03:02:19,208 --> 03:02:22,638
I'm going to do a head shot.

2706
03:02:22,638 --> 03:02:24,411
MATT: Okay.

2707
03:02:24,411 --> 03:02:32,793
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to attempt to make him
have issues doing things.

2708
03:02:32,793 --> 03:02:34,237
Natural 20.

2709
03:02:34,237 --> 03:02:36,145
(cheering)

2710
03:02:36,145 --> 03:02:38,119
TRAVIS: The golden snitch strikes again!

2711
03:02:38,119 --> 03:02:40,505
MARISHA: Yeah, it did! I can see it from here!

2712
03:02:40,505 --> 03:02:43,106
MATT: Damn!

2713
03:02:43,106 --> 03:02:44,301
TALIESIN: I swear it's-- yeah.

2714
03:02:44,301 --> 03:02:45,475
MATT: With the additional d6, by the way.

2715
03:02:45,475 --> 03:02:46,304
TALIESIN: What?

2716
03:02:46,304 --> 03:02:47,369
MATT: With the additional d6.

2717
03:02:47,369 --> 03:02:48,752
TALIESIN: Does the d6 double or does it not
double?

2718
03:02:48,752 --> 03:02:52,141
MATT: All dice rolled double. Then add the
modifier.

2719
03:02:52,141 --> 03:02:53,522
TALIESIN: This is going to be angry.

2720
03:02:53,522 --> 03:02:54,332
MARISHA: Yeah it is!

2721
03:02:54,332 --> 03:02:55,586
LIAM: Gunslinger warlock.

2722
03:02:55,586 --> 03:02:58,430
TALIESIN: So.

2723
03:02:58,430 --> 03:03:04,530
MARISHA: That's pretty "grood."

2724
03:03:04,530 --> 03:03:17,780
TALIESIN: 42 points of damage. Of fire damage. 42
points, and that's with 5 points of fire damage.

2725
03:03:17,780 --> 03:03:18,813
42 points.

2726
03:03:18,813 --> 03:03:25,160
MATT: Okay. (gunshot) The first blast hits and you
can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and

2727
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:29,275
set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the
corner. Sir Kerrion looks down and is like

2728
03:03:29,275 --> 03:03:39,870
(grunts), and is looking very, very curiously. The
second shot rings out (gunshot), and at this point

2729
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:45,165
now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm, the
gun isn't even visible, it's just this giant column

2730
03:03:45,165 --> 03:03:51,920
of smoke. (gunshot) The second shot rings out, this
time hitting him in the side of the neck and the

2731
03:03:51,962 --> 03:03:56,647
shoulder, blowing a chunk off of it so part of the
bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of

2732
03:03:56,693 --> 03:04:00,194
pain). He reaches back with his arm and is like
with the rapier up, clutching it for a second and

2733
03:04:00,194 --> 03:04:04,952
leans over and looks back over and is (pained
panting) "Ripley."

2734
03:04:04,952 --> 03:04:13,531
TALIESIN: Just as an action, as a bonus action,
I'm going to remove my hat, and I'm just going to

2735
03:04:13,531 --> 03:04:16,434
say: Drop it.

2736
03:04:16,434 --> 03:04:19,813
SAM: Will this take an action?

2737
03:04:19,813 --> 03:04:23,592
MATT: To drop the spell? You can do it on your
turn.

2738
03:04:23,592 --> 03:04:24,738
TALIESIN: On your turn, yeah.

2739
03:04:24,738 --> 03:04:26,464
SAM: Okay. I think that's next.

2740
03:04:26,464 --> 03:04:29,070
MATT: All right, so.

2741
03:04:29,070 --> 03:04:38,759
MARISHA: He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's
Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns!

2742
03:04:38,759 --> 03:04:40,705
LAURA: It's Ripley that's doing the guns!

2743
03:04:40,705 --> 03:04:41,801
MARISHA: Fucking Ripley!

2744
03:04:41,801 --> 03:04:49,337
MATT: So. That finishes Percy's turn. It is now
Sir Kerrion Stonefell's turn. Kerrion's going to

2745
03:04:49,337 --> 03:04:51,466
use a bonus action to use Second Wind.

2746
03:04:51,466 --> 03:04:55,189
SAM: Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing
isn't it?

2747
03:04:55,189 --> 03:04:57,617
TALIESIN: That's healing. It's not much healing.

2748
03:04:57,617 --> 03:04:58,856
MARISHA: Wait, who's doing what?

2749
03:04:58,856 --> 03:05:00,468
SAM: He has 6,000 health points.

2750
03:05:00,468 --> 03:05:05,782
MARISHA: Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration
thing or is he casting a spell?

2751
03:05:05,782 --> 03:05:07,981
TALIESIN: No, it's a fighter action.

2752
03:05:07,981 --> 03:05:14,464
MATT: And that was with the head shot, you said?

2753
03:05:14,464 --> 03:05:21,682
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was with a head shot. So that
means he has disadvantage on

2754
03:05:21,682 --> 03:05:24,261
attacks for one round.

2755
03:05:24,261 --> 03:05:25,469
MATT: And deals damage, right?

2756
03:05:25,469 --> 03:05:26,641
TALIESIN: And deals damage.

2757
03:05:26,641 --> 03:05:27,764
MATT: Okay.

2758
03:05:27,764 --> 03:05:29,256
TALIESIN: I'm a good boy.

2759
03:05:29,256 --> 03:05:37,044
MATT: Sir Kerrion is going to, in the
circumstance, is going to move this way just to

2760
03:05:37,044 --> 03:05:43,027
hide alongside Vax, and since you're on top-- his
both rapiers out, and you just jammed your daggers

2761
03:05:43,027 --> 03:05:45,952
in, is going to do a flurry of four strikes
against you.

2762
03:05:45,952 --> 03:05:47,131
LIAM: Okay.

2763
03:05:47,131 --> 03:05:48,952
MATT: With disadvantage on all the attacks.

2764
03:05:48,952 --> 03:05:51,142
TRAVIS: His clavicles sticking out of his
shoulders.

2765
03:05:51,142 --> 03:05:52,041
MATT: Yeah.

2766
03:05:52,041 --> 03:05:57,278
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one
that hits.

2767
03:05:57,278 --> 03:05:59,303
MATT: 16, the first attack?

2768
03:05:59,303 --> 03:06:00,255
LIAM: No.

2769
03:06:00,255 --> 03:06:13,352
MATT: All right. Rolled a one on the second. That
is a 21 on the third attack. And, no, that's a 14

2770
03:06:13,352 --> 03:06:18,082
on the fourth attack. That disadvantage just--
swinging wide, gets one hit on you.

2771
03:06:18,137 --> 03:06:19,978
TRAVIS: Get that clavicle; be working.

2772
03:06:19,978 --> 03:06:22,924
LIAM: Yeah, Uncanny Dodge on that attack.

2773
03:06:22,967 --> 03:06:25,778
MATT: That is eight points of piercing damage
against you.

2774
03:06:25,778 --> 03:06:26,767
LIAM: So, four.

2775
03:06:26,767 --> 03:06:28,902
SAM: Ooh! That's nothing!

2776
03:06:28,902 --> 03:06:29,973
LIAM: That's nothing.

2777
03:06:29,973 --> 03:06:32,735
MATT: That finishes Sir Kerrion. Sir Kerrion is
now going to--

2778
03:06:32,735 --> 03:06:35,222
SAM: Turn invisible.

2779
03:06:35,222 --> 03:06:40,887
MATT: He's actually going to take a step back
towards the wall. You get an attack of

2780
03:06:40,887 --> 03:06:42,187
opportunity.

2781
03:06:42,187 --> 03:06:43,877
LIAM: All right. I throw a dagger in his face.

2782
03:06:43,877 --> 03:06:45,262
MATT: All right.

2783
03:06:45,262 --> 03:06:49,145
LIAM: That is a 28.

2784
03:06:49,145 --> 03:06:50,420
MATT: That hits.

2785
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:55,146
LIAM: That is eight points of damage.

2786
03:06:55,146 --> 03:07:01,420
MATT: All righty. Steps back and slams his fist
against the wall (thudding).

2787
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:02,691
LAURA: Oh no!

2788
03:07:02,691 --> 03:07:03,934
SAM: Wait, who did that?

2789
03:07:03,934 --> 03:07:05,157
LAURA and TRAVIS: Kerrion.

2790
03:07:05,157 --> 03:07:06,874
LAURA: He's calling in backup.

2791
03:07:06,874 --> 03:07:10,418
MARISHA: Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit.

2792
03:07:10,418 --> 03:07:11,616
LIAM: Yeah.

2793
03:07:11,616 --> 03:07:14,818
MATT: So, that ends Kerrion's turn. Grog, you're
up.

2794
03:07:14,818 --> 03:07:17,740
TRAVIS: I keep smashing shithead that's in front
of me!

2795
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:19,270
MATT: Okay, go for it!

2796
03:07:19,270 --> 03:07:24,145
TRAVIS: That's 24. These are just regular.

2797
03:07:24,145 --> 03:07:25,201
MATT: Yeah, 24 hits.

2798
03:07:25,201 --> 03:07:30,285
TRAVIS: Oh, I should roll the other one first.
Again, 24.

2799
03:07:30,285 --> 03:07:34,045
MATT: 24 hits. Are you going into a frenzied
rage?

2800
03:07:34,045 --> 03:07:42,682
TRAVIS: Regular rage. 23 on the first one.

2801
03:07:42,682 --> 03:07:43,968
MATT: All righty.

2802
03:07:43,968 --> 03:07:48,200
TRAVIS: And 12 on the second.

2803
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:51,327
MATT: Gotcha. (whack) Is this with the fire damage
as well from the hammer?

2804
03:07:51,327 --> 03:07:52,250
TRAVIS: Yes.

2805
03:07:52,250 --> 03:07:56,405
MATT: Yeah. so the hammer strikes across the back,
the broadside of his shoulders and back. (grunts)

2806
03:07:56,405 --> 03:08:02,642
Looks up at you and looks over at Sir Kerrion
being annihilated behind the desk and is trying to

2807
03:08:02,642 --> 03:08:10,709
nervously gauge his circumstance. Second strike
smacks him upside his body and he's like (panting)

2808
03:08:10,709 --> 03:08:16,415
and he's trying to take in the surroundings and
figure out a plan. All right, are you going to

2809
03:08:16,415 --> 03:08:17,155
stay where you are?

2810
03:08:17,155 --> 03:08:18,422
TRAVIS: That's it.

2811
03:08:18,422 --> 03:08:23,631
MATT: It is now Master Vouk's turn.

2812
03:08:23,631 --> 03:08:24,768
SAM: Who?

2813
03:08:24,768 --> 03:08:28,083
MATT: You have not heard his name yet, but it's
his turn.

2814
03:08:28,083 --> 03:08:29,785
TRAVIS: The guy I've been smacking.

2815
03:08:29,785 --> 03:08:33,061
TALIESIN: Mr. Rogaine.

2816
03:08:33,061 --> 03:08:38,336
LAURA: I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in--

2817
03:08:38,336 --> 03:08:39,332
TALIESIN: From Harry Potter.

2818
03:08:39,332 --> 03:08:40,070
LAURA: Yeah!

2819
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:41,276
TALIESIN: Yeah. I know, me too.

2820
03:08:41,276 --> 03:08:42,097
TRAVIS: Mr. Filch?

2821
03:08:42,097 --> 03:08:44,796
TALIESIN: Filch. Filch on steroids.

2822
03:08:44,796 --> 03:08:45,999
LAURA: Yeah.

2823
03:08:45,999 --> 03:08:59,649
MATT: He's going to use a-- okay. He's going to
use a bonus action to disengage from you. He's

2824
03:08:59,649 --> 03:09:05,085
going to back away just one step that way. Use his
action to--

2825
03:09:05,085 --> 03:09:06,766
LAURA: He has magic?!

2826
03:09:06,766 --> 03:09:08,557
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out.

2827
03:09:08,557 --> 03:09:13,520
LAURA: But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic.

2828
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:14,847
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a squib!

2829
03:09:14,847 --> 03:09:17,864
LAURA: He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic.

2830
03:09:17,864 --> 03:09:22,661
TRAVIS: He knows this. He's making origami.

2831
03:09:22,661 --> 03:09:25,611
TALIESIN: Don't you get an attack of opportunity?

2832
03:09:25,611 --> 03:09:29,988
MATT: Actually, instead, he's not going to use
bonus action to disengage, he's going to use a

2833
03:09:29,988 --> 03:09:37,392
bonus action to use Misty Step. Vanishes,
reappears over by the wall. Uses the action to

2834
03:09:37,392 --> 03:09:45,408
cast a level three Invisibility on both him and
Sir Kerrion Stonefell. So they are both

2835
03:09:45,408 --> 03:09:48,347
considered invisible at the moment.

2836
03:09:48,400 --> 03:09:51,577
TRAVIS: With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an
attack?

2837
03:09:51,577 --> 03:09:54,820
MATT: Not from that, unfortunately; it's an
immediate teleport. So he just vanishes from in

2838
03:09:54,820 --> 03:09:55,962
front of you.

2839
03:09:55,962 --> 03:09:57,866
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

2840
03:09:57,866 --> 03:10:01,594
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, they
are both currently invisible.

2841
03:10:01,594 --> 03:10:05,092
And that's going to end--

2842
03:10:05,092 --> 03:10:09,454
TALIESIN: That soldier hasn't attacked yet,
either.

2843
03:10:09,454 --> 03:10:15,004
MATT: Correct, his turn hasn't come up yet. Now it
becomes Scanlan's turn.

2844
03:10:15,047 --> 03:10:23,997
SAM: Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who
I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy

2845
03:10:23,997 --> 03:10:33,755
under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows
to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message

2846
03:10:33,755 --> 03:10:43,790
and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get
inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming,

2847
03:10:43,790 --> 03:10:47,425
I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways.

2848
03:10:47,425 --> 03:10:51,625
MATT: Okay. Stinking Cloud appears. What's the
radius on that?

2849
03:10:51,625 --> 03:10:55,997
SAM: (singing) Stinking Cloud!

2850
03:10:55,997 --> 03:10:58,094
MATT: I think it's a 20-foot radius, isn't it?

2851
03:10:58,094 --> 03:11:02,179
SAM: It says 90-feet range, let's see here.
20-foot radius.

2852
03:11:02,179 --> 03:11:06,163
MATT: Okay, cool. So you just filled this entire
hallway.

2853
03:11:06,163 --> 03:11:09,100
SAM: Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well?

2854
03:11:09,100 --> 03:11:12,534
MATT: You can keep it localized to that area,
you'll just be in your own cloud.

2855
03:11:12,534 --> 03:11:14,585
SAM: Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door?

2856
03:11:14,585 --> 03:11:18,346
MATT: You stop just short of the door and fill
this whole area with a Stinking Cloud.

2857
03:11:18,346 --> 03:11:19,538
SAM: Sorry, Vex.

2858
03:11:19,538 --> 03:11:23,377
TALIESIN: You can hold that action until she comes
into the room.

2859
03:11:23,377 --> 03:11:26,361
SAM: Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the
room.

2860
03:11:26,361 --> 03:11:29,840
MATT: Okay. So Stinking Cloud is not yet up.
Okay.

2861
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:32,768
SAM: Laura's next, I believe.

2862
03:11:32,768 --> 03:11:39,354
MATT: So, next round. You are up next.

2863
03:11:39,354 --> 03:11:41,395
SAM: And I will inspire her, as well.

2864
03:11:41,395 --> 03:11:42,352
LAURA: Yay!

2865
03:11:42,352 --> 03:11:44,225
SAM: Do you want a d10?

2866
03:11:44,225 --> 03:11:45,363
LAURA: Yeah.

2867
03:11:45,363 --> 03:11:56,701
SAM: Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick!
Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how

2868
03:11:56,701 --> 03:12:00,359
you're going to react because Vex has an attack!
Oi!

2869
03:12:00,359 --> 03:12:04,247
TRAVIS: Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it!

2870
03:12:04,247 --> 03:12:12,078
MATT: You take your d10 inspiration. Confused, but
accept the inspiration. A chuckle in the middle of

2871
03:12:12,078 --> 03:12:14,576
a hearty battle is always worth a little
inspiration.

2872
03:12:14,576 --> 03:12:17,178
LAURA: All right, so I go in the room.

2873
03:12:17,178 --> 03:12:22,768
MATT: You step into the room. At that point, you
trigger your action to release the Stinking Cloud.

2874
03:12:22,768 --> 03:12:24,957
You want to stay there? You're just outside of the
radius.

2875
03:12:24,957 --> 03:12:28,944
LAURA: Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I
back-- well.

2876
03:12:28,944 --> 03:12:31,723
MATT: What are you doing, Vex?

2877
03:12:31,723 --> 03:12:37,780
LAURA: Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see;
is there a soldier right there next to the

2878
03:12:37,780 --> 03:12:40,546
invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys?

2879
03:12:40,546 --> 03:12:44,136
TRAVIS: On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by
Keyleth, and then invisible.

2880
03:12:44,136 --> 03:12:53,142
SAM: There two invisibles, and then another
soldier who I have already Dominated. He still

2881
03:12:53,142 --> 03:12:54,675
hasn't had a turn?!

2882
03:12:54,675 --> 03:12:58,864
MATT: Surprise round, and they're lowest on the
initiative count.

2883
03:12:58,864 --> 03:13:03,492
LAURA: Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow
because that gets everything within ten feet.

2884
03:13:03,492 --> 03:13:04,793
MATT: Okay.

2885
03:13:04,793 --> 03:13:07,225
LAURA: I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the
soldier on the ground.

2886
03:13:07,225 --> 03:13:08,645
MATT: Which one?

2887
03:13:08,645 --> 03:13:10,103
TRAVIS: The one that Keyleth's attacking.

2888
03:13:10,103 --> 03:13:11,269
LAURA: The one that Keyleth's attacking.

2889
03:13:11,269 --> 03:13:15,637
MATT: I will say you don't really have visual on
him from that position.

2890
03:13:15,637 --> 03:13:17,004
LAURA: Can I move to a place where I get it?

2891
03:13:17,004 --> 03:13:18,426
LIAM: Do a bank shot off the ceiling.

2892
03:13:18,426 --> 03:13:20,273
MATT: Now you can see, yeah.

2893
03:13:20,273 --> 03:13:21,563
LAURA: Awesome. Let's do it from there.

2894
03:13:21,563 --> 03:13:24,540
MATT: Okay, go for it. You have advantage on the
attack roll because he is prone.

2895
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:29,460
LAURA: Nice. 27.

2896
03:13:29,460 --> 03:13:30,642
MATT: 27 hits.

2897
03:13:30,642 --> 03:13:33,577
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him.

2898
03:13:33,577 --> 03:13:34,668
MATT: All righty.

2899
03:13:34,668 --> 03:13:38,992
LAURA: And then anything within ten feet has to
make a dex save.

2900
03:13:38,992 --> 03:13:40,253
MATT: Okay.

2901
03:13:40,253 --> 03:13:43,589
SAM: Is that including your brother?

2902
03:13:43,589 --> 03:13:45,647
LAURA: Yeah, that's everything within ten feet.

2903
03:13:45,647 --> 03:13:47,212
TRAVIS: It's also including invisible guys.

2904
03:13:47,212 --> 03:13:50,313
MATT: If it's ten feet, he's not there. It'd just
be Keyleth and Sir Kerrion.

2905
03:13:50,313 --> 03:13:58,189
MARISHA: 22. 21!

2906
03:13:58,189 --> 03:14:02,565
MATT: Makes it, 21, actually, exactly.

2907
03:14:02,565 --> 03:14:06,726
LAURA: 19 to little prone soldier.

2908
03:14:06,726 --> 03:14:13,138
MATT: Okay, 19. As it snaps and it bursts, the
electricity shockwaves out, he shakes and on the

2909
03:14:13,138 --> 03:14:18,161
ground takes in the effect. The blast seems to--
is it half damage if they make the save?

2910
03:14:18,161 --> 03:14:21,222
LAURA: To the little prone guy?

2911
03:14:21,222 --> 03:14:23,297
MATT: No, it's to anybody within radius.

2912
03:14:23,297 --> 03:14:28,258
LAURA: Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they
make the save and then 2d8 if they fail.

2913
03:14:28,258 --> 03:14:29,523
MATT: Okay, so roll 1d8.

2914
03:14:29,523 --> 03:14:32,130
LAURA: One.

2915
03:14:32,130 --> 03:14:37,947
MATT: Okay. So one damage to you, and one damage
to Sir Kerrion.

2916
03:14:37,947 --> 03:14:39,060
LAURA: Oh.

2917
03:14:39,060 --> 03:14:43,206
MATT: You see a spark of energy around the
invisible form as it wavers in place.

2918
03:14:43,206 --> 03:14:46,057
TRAVIS: That's good; at least he (electricity
noise) around some.

2919
03:14:46,057 --> 03:14:48,541
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Vax?

2920
03:14:48,541 --> 03:14:52,913
LIAM: I saw that spark in the air and I start 
knifing right into it.

2921
03:14:52,977 --> 03:14:55,759
MATT: All right. Was that the last thing you
wanted to do with your turn?

2922
03:14:55,759 --> 03:15:00,044
LAURA: Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him,
the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with

2923
03:15:00,044 --> 03:15:01,894
anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an
arrow?

2924
03:15:01,894 --> 03:15:05,978
MATT: I think if you attack him. That was more of
the burst in the vicinity.

2925
03:15:05,978 --> 03:15:07,415
LAURA: Okay.

2926
03:15:07,415 --> 03:15:10,393
LIAM: So, hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a
spark right in front of me, I start knifing at

2927
03:15:10,393 --> 03:15:11,710
that point.

2928
03:15:11,710 --> 03:15:13,313
MATT: All right. At disadvantage on all the
attacks.

2929
03:15:13,370 --> 03:15:16,327
LIAM: Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it
cancels out.

2930
03:15:16,327 --> 03:15:17,812
MATT: Why do you get advantage?

2931
03:15:17,812 --> 03:15:20,437
LIAM: Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.

2932
03:15:20,437 --> 03:15:22,752
MATT: Disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's
invisible.

2933
03:15:22,752 --> 03:15:30,684
LIAM: The first one misses. That was it. So, the
first two were terrible. That's terrible. That's

2934
03:15:30,684 --> 03:15:33,601
also terrible. I whiff. I just (whooshing).

2935
03:15:33,601 --> 03:15:38,363
MATT: Yeah, you're swinging in the area, and you
can't get blades to find any of his physical

2936
03:15:38,363 --> 03:15:42,949
person. You're striking and arcing across the
wooden wall behind him, causing these giant

2937
03:15:42,949 --> 03:15:45,385
gashes. All right, that ends your turn.

2938
03:15:45,385 --> 03:15:46,534
LIAM: Still bleeding!

2939
03:15:46,534 --> 03:15:49,288
MATT: Unless you want to stay where you are right
there?

2940
03:15:49,288 --> 03:15:51,889
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to stay there.

2941
03:15:51,889 --> 03:15:54,297
MATT: You probably would've had to move up there
to attack him. Oh, you're just throwing the

2942
03:15:54,297 --> 03:15:55,357
daggers, right?

2943
03:15:55,357 --> 03:15:58,510
LIAM: I back up. Is Keyleth on the desk?

2944
03:15:58,510 --> 03:16:00,072
SAM: No, she's next to the desk.

2945
03:16:00,072 --> 03:16:03,283
LIAM: And I'm on the desk? No, I'll stay where I
am.

2946
03:16:03,283 --> 03:16:05,722
MATT: Okay, so you're just throwing the daggers
from the desk? Okay, that ends your turn.

2947
03:16:05,722 --> 03:16:08,785
Now, Keyleth.

2948
03:16:08,785 --> 03:16:17,937
MARISHA: Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion
is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the

2949
03:16:17,937 --> 03:16:24,690
distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast
Faerie Fire in that radius.

2950
03:16:24,690 --> 03:16:27,488
MATT: Drop your wolf form.

2951
03:16:27,488 --> 03:16:28,806
MARISHA: 20-foot cube.

2952
03:16:28,806 --> 03:16:30,255
SAM: Mark that shit.

2953
03:16:30,255 --> 03:16:33,322
MARISHA: Right here.

2954
03:16:33,322 --> 03:16:34,656
MATT: Okay.

2955
03:16:34,656 --> 03:16:40,340
MARISHA: Realizing my party members are clearly
stabbing at something.

2956
03:16:40,340 --> 03:16:45,680
TALIESIN: I like it when he has to go to the book.
Makes me feel like there's, perhaps, things he

2957
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:46,755
doesn't know.

2958
03:16:46,755 --> 03:16:49,640
SAM: Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's
really cool.

2959
03:16:49,640 --> 03:16:53,624
MATT: Yeah, so both of their forms all of a
sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo

2960
03:16:53,624 --> 03:16:55,631
that shows you directly where they are.

2961
03:16:55,631 --> 03:16:56,613
SAM: Yes!

2962
03:16:56,613 --> 03:17:00,400
MATT: All right. So that's your turn? You going to
move anywhere?

2963
03:17:00,400 --> 03:17:03,799
MARISHA: I'll back up a tidbit.

2964
03:17:03,799 --> 03:17:05,082
MATT: Okay.

2965
03:17:05,082 --> 03:17:07,876
MARISHA: Just back up a smidge.

2966
03:17:07,876 --> 03:17:13,769
MATT: Okay, as you back up an invisible form that
just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier,

2967
03:17:13,769 --> 03:17:15,374
an attack of opportunity.

2968
03:17:15,374 --> 03:17:16,642
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, whatever.

2969
03:17:16,642 --> 03:17:17,746
TALIESIN: But, he's--

2970
03:17:17,746 --> 03:17:21,723
MATT: At disadvantage on the attack. He has
advantage on her because he's-- although--

2971
03:17:21,723 --> 03:17:23,322
MARISHA: I can see him now.

2972
03:17:23,322 --> 03:17:24,512
MATT: You can see him, that's true.

2973
03:17:24,512 --> 03:17:26,884
LAURA: This is confusing!

2974
03:17:26,884 --> 03:17:29,356
MATT: Faerie Fire kind of made this weird.

2975
03:17:29,356 --> 03:17:30,598
TRAVIS: To the books again!

2976
03:17:30,598 --> 03:17:31,711
MATT: Indeed.

2977
03:17:31,711 --> 03:17:33,105
MARISHA: Faerie Fire always makes it weird.

2978
03:17:33,105 --> 03:17:38,339
TALIESIN: Ain't it the truth? Man, that Faerie
Fire.

2979
03:17:38,339 --> 03:17:42,507
MATT: Just a minute, folks. Lot of overlapping
effects, here, because everyone has magic.

2980
03:17:42,507 --> 03:17:46,395
SAM: Now's a good time to go to the store and
check out Critical Role t-shirt--

2981
03:17:46,395 --> 03:17:51,418
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't benefit from Invisible.
It's at disadvantage. It has disadvantage on the

2982
03:17:51,418 --> 03:17:54,058
attack. That is--

2983
03:17:54,058 --> 03:17:56,365
SAM: Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.

2984
03:17:56,365 --> 03:17:57,877
MATT: And 15.

2985
03:17:57,877 --> 03:17:58,713
MARISHA: Miss.

2986
03:17:58,713 --> 03:18:08,075
MATT: Yeah, so (whoosh) as you back up. All right.
That ends your turn. Now, this guard gets up,

2987
03:18:08,075 --> 03:18:16,542
(grunts) gets his crossbow, aims it up and,
looking around the room, aims it, this would be--

2988
03:18:16,542 --> 03:18:29,124
seeing his friend turn on his boss briefly after
you shouted that song at him, is going to turn the

2989
03:18:29,124 --> 03:18:30,612
crossbow on you.

2990
03:18:30,612 --> 03:18:31,556
SAM: On me?!

2991
03:18:31,556 --> 03:18:32,321
MATT: Yes.

2992
03:18:32,321 --> 03:18:33,160
SAM: Jesus.

2993
03:18:33,160 --> 03:18:36,595
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit?

2994
03:18:36,595 --> 03:18:39,442
SAM: I don't even know any more. No one's attacked
me in a while.

2995
03:18:39,442 --> 03:18:40,689
TALIESIN: It's your AC.

2996
03:18:40,689 --> 03:18:42,607
SAM: It's 17.

2997
03:18:42,607 --> 03:18:43,699
MATT: 17!

2998
03:18:43,699 --> 03:18:46,073
SAM: Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some
thing on.

2999
03:18:46,073 --> 03:18:48,341
MARISHA: You've got the amulet on.

3000
03:18:48,341 --> 03:18:54,552
MATT: All right. So, as it comes towards you, you just
duck out of the way and it passes and snags into

3001
03:18:54,594 --> 03:19:00,776
the wall behind you (arrow landing sound). No hit.
The thug is then going to drop the crossbow on the

3002
03:19:00,776 --> 03:19:06,189
ground and rushing up, pull out a mace that was
hanging from the side of its belt and engage you

3003
03:19:06,189 --> 03:19:08,791
right there.

3004
03:19:08,791 --> 03:19:10,124
TRAVIS: I thought he was coming for me.

3005
03:19:10,124 --> 03:19:11,823
SAM: I thought so, too. That would have been
good!

3006
03:19:11,823 --> 03:19:25,435
MATT: This guy is going to attempt to make two
attacks against Master Vouk Strono. Has advantage

3007
03:19:25,435 --> 03:19:34,881
on them because Faerie Fire. That hits. And, two
attacks with a mace. That is 18. Yeah, hits with

3008
03:19:34,881 --> 03:19:37,465
both. (whack whack) With the mace both times.

3009
03:19:37,465 --> 03:19:40,020
MARISHA: Is that the guy who you charmed?
Awesome.

3010
03:19:40,020 --> 03:19:41,132
TALIESIN: Nice.

3011
03:19:41,132 --> 03:19:42,834
SAM: Wait. Who's this?

3012
03:19:42,834 --> 03:19:44,317
LIAM: The guy you charmed.

3013
03:19:44,317 --> 03:19:46,269
SAM: That's not my guy, Matt.

3014
03:19:46,269 --> 03:19:47,073
MATT: That guy?

3015
03:19:47,073 --> 03:19:49,071
SAM: Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's
attacking my guy?

3016
03:19:49,071 --> 03:19:51,342
MATT: No, he's attacking the guy that's
invisible.

3017
03:19:51,342 --> 03:19:54,182
(laughter)

3018
03:19:54,182 --> 03:19:59,548
MATT: Doing a total of 16 damage with his mace.
(whack whack) Bludgeoning. He's now going to try

3019
03:19:59,548 --> 03:20:03,027
and make the saving throw to shrug it. What's the
DC on that?

3020
03:20:03,027 --> 03:20:04,472
SAM: On my spell?

3021
03:20:04,472 --> 03:20:05,418
MATT: Yeah.

3022
03:20:05,418 --> 03:20:06,579
SAM: It's 19.

3023
03:20:06,579 --> 03:20:12,577
MATT: 19. Yeah, he does not make it. Still under
control. That ends the thugs' turn. Top of the

3024
03:20:12,577 --> 03:20:13,855
round. Percy, you're up!

3025
03:20:13,855 --> 03:20:16,069
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go!

3026
03:20:16,069 --> 03:20:20,863
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter against Kerrion.

3027
03:20:20,863 --> 03:20:22,086
MATT: Sir Kerrion, okay.

3028
03:20:22,086 --> 03:20:24,901
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage on that because of
Faerie Fire?

3029
03:20:24,901 --> 03:20:32,062
MATT: It does not benefit from invisibility and
you have advantage. Yes, you do.

3030
03:20:32,062 --> 03:20:35,564
Vox Machina: broken.

3031
03:20:35,564 --> 03:20:37,613
(laughter)

3032
03:20:37,613 --> 03:20:39,853
TALIESIN: 16.

3033
03:20:39,853 --> 03:20:41,566
MATT: 16 to hit?

3034
03:20:41,566 --> 03:20:42,567
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3035
03:20:42,567 --> 03:20:43,793
MATT: Misses.

3036
03:20:43,793 --> 03:20:45,517
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

3037
03:20:45,517 --> 03:20:46,842
MARISHA: That was with advantage?

3038
03:20:46,842 --> 03:20:47,804
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3039
03:20:47,804 --> 03:20:48,721
MARISHA: Pooper.

3040
03:20:48,721 --> 03:20:51,295
TALIESIN: 20.

3041
03:20:51,295 --> 03:20:52,676
MATT: 20 does hit.

3042
03:20:52,676 --> 03:21:00,081
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

3043
03:21:00,081 --> 03:21:05,683
MATT: 15. (gunshot) You see one blast hits the
wall and causes part of the wood to splinter

3044
03:21:05,683 --> 03:21:11,910
outward. The second shot impacts the partially
invisible form. You can see a splash of blood

3045
03:21:11,910 --> 03:21:17,047
across the desk in front. Partially spattering
across Vax and one of his guards.

3046
03:21:17,047 --> 03:21:26,786
TALIESIN: Third shot with ice. No sharpshooter.
Natural 20!

3047
03:21:26,786 --> 03:21:28,195
TRAVIS: What?!

3048
03:21:28,195 --> 03:21:30,999
MARISHA: Percy rolls!

3049
03:21:30,999 --> 03:21:32,783
TRAVIS: What the hell?!

3050
03:21:32,783 --> 03:21:36,990
TALIESIN: It's making up for my gun failing four
times.

3051
03:21:36,990 --> 03:21:38,520
TRAVIS: Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.

3052
03:21:38,520 --> 03:21:39,590
TALIESIN: I know.

3053
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:43,220
TRAVIS: (laughing) Smoke arm.

3054
03:21:43,220 --> 03:21:58,117
TALIESIN: Six, 16, 25, 31 points of damage. 31
points of damage with four points of that being

3055
03:21:58,117 --> 03:22:01,606
ice damage.

3056
03:22:01,606 --> 03:22:06,654
MATT: So, Percy: how do you want to do this?

3057
03:22:06,654 --> 03:22:08,819
TRAVIS: He said that weird.

3058
03:22:08,819 --> 03:22:10,352
MARISHA: This against Kerrion, right?

3059
03:22:10,352 --> 03:22:11,789
MATT: This is against Sir Kerrion.

3060
03:22:11,789 --> 03:22:15,798
SAM: Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the
logo that's on the shirt that's

3061
03:22:15,798 --> 03:22:17,115
for sale right now.

3062
03:22:17,115 --> 03:22:18,407
TALIESIN: Oh, stop it.

3063
03:22:18,407 --> 03:22:20,736
TRAVIS: Is this the name on one of the barrels?

3064
03:22:20,736 --> 03:22:21,779
MATT: Percy.

3065
03:22:21,779 --> 03:22:22,830
TALIESIN: Don't cheapen this!

3066
03:22:22,830 --> 03:22:23,941
SAM: Too late.

3067
03:22:23,941 --> 03:22:29,705
MATT: Currently visible, at your disposal, Sir
Kerrion. You have enough of a shot to finish him

3068
03:22:29,705 --> 03:22:36,328
off. The smoke is pushing you, "Vengeance.
Vengeance. Vengeance." Repeatedly echoing in the

3069
03:22:36,328 --> 03:22:39,218
back of your mind. How do you want to do this?

3070
03:22:39,218 --> 03:22:43,404
TALIESIN: I'm going to put on the mask, since he
still doesn't know who I am.

3071
03:22:43,404 --> 03:22:52,679
MATT: Okay. You pull the mask down, the
bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in

3072
03:22:52,679 --> 03:22:58,589
smoke, resembling, very closely, the entity that
made the original bargain with you.

3073
03:22:58,662 --> 03:23:06,989
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to him. Yeah,
there's no way to drop the illusion. That's such a

3074
03:23:06,989 --> 03:23:08,279
damn shame.

3075
03:23:08,279 --> 03:23:09,879
SAM: Oh wait, you told me to!

3076
03:23:09,879 --> 03:23:10,753
TALIESIN: I did.

3077
03:23:10,753 --> 03:23:13,558
SAM: I could have; I didn't. Fuck! (laughs)

3078
03:23:13,558 --> 03:23:17,105
MARISHA: Could you do it now, for flavor?

3079
03:23:17,105 --> 03:23:24,105
TALIESIN: That's fine. The mask will do. I'm going
to take one last shot. I'm going to look right at

3080
03:23:24,105 --> 03:23:33,805
him, I'm going to catch his eye. This is for the
de Rolos. And let me say: you were the one I was

3081
03:23:33,805 --> 03:23:36,176
least looking forward to.

3082
03:23:36,176 --> 03:23:38,130
TRAVIS: That's some cold shit!

3083
03:23:38,130 --> 03:23:45,380
MATT: With that, the little bit of wreathed
magical energy you can barely make out an

3084
03:23:45,380 --> 03:23:52,385
expression of horror on the face before the
resounding blast sound rocks the room. The actual

3085
03:23:52,385 --> 03:23:59,094
bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as
it impacts the front of Sir Kerrion's face. The

3086
03:23:59,094 --> 03:24:07,681
entirety of his head caving inward as the back
splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind

3087
03:24:07,681 --> 03:24:17,251
him. The body slumps to the ground immediately.
You guys all glance over at Percy. You don't even

3088
03:24:17,324 --> 03:24:28,481
see Percy, you just see a humanoid entity made of
black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak

3089
03:24:28,481 --> 03:24:30,618
of his mask poking through.

3090
03:24:30,618 --> 03:24:34,965
MARISHA: Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take
my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up

3091
03:24:34,965 --> 03:24:38,068
and move it over top of the black smoke figure?

3092
03:24:38,068 --> 03:24:42,126
MATT: Can you move a Faerie Fire?

3093
03:24:42,126 --> 03:24:44,072
MARISHA: I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire?

3094
03:24:44,072 --> 03:24:47,523
MATT: I think when you use it, it just stays where
it was. Could be wrong, but I'm

3095
03:24:47,523 --> 03:24:48,928
pretty sure that's how it works.

3096
03:24:48,928 --> 03:24:53,471
MARISHA: 20 feet; is he in it, perchance?

3097
03:24:53,471 --> 03:24:59,284
MATT: From there, it's 20 foot, no. Not from where
you placed it right on him, unfortunately. That's

3098
03:24:59,284 --> 03:25:03,510
okay. Yeah, no, it just happens once.

3099
03:25:03,510 --> 03:25:04,830
MARISHA: Never mind.

3100
03:25:04,830 --> 03:25:14,491
MATT: With that, you recoil from it and the voice
echoes in the back of your head, going "Yes."

3101
03:25:14,491 --> 03:25:16,568
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop the gun.

3102
03:25:16,568 --> 03:25:18,706
MATT: You drop it (impact sound).

3103
03:25:18,706 --> 03:25:26,320
TALIESIN: Remove my mask. Run to find something
metal, something sharp, anywhere on the table. And

3104
03:25:26,320 --> 03:25:30,636
just start scratching off the name on the gun. I'm
just going to go to a corner and just start

3105
03:25:30,636 --> 03:25:33,323
scratching the name off.

3106
03:25:33,419 --> 03:25:34,384
MATT: Okay.

3107
03:25:34,384 --> 03:25:37,675
SAM: He's disturbed.

3108
03:25:37,675 --> 03:25:40,955
MATT: Okay, that's your turn.

3109
03:25:40,955 --> 03:25:42,027
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

3110
03:25:42,027 --> 03:25:51,254
MATT: Sir Kerrion is gone. Annihilated. That
brings us to Grog.

3111
03:25:51,254 --> 03:25:55,774
TRAVIS: Percy's having all the fun. And I start
smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax.

3112
03:25:55,774 --> 03:26:00,090
MATT: Right there, okay. So you move up to him,
(whoosh) swinging the hammer wide.

3113
03:26:00,090 --> 03:26:04,559
TRAVIS: Might as well make these great weapon
master strikes, just for fucking why not.

3114
03:26:04,559 --> 03:26:08,475
That's a 15.

3115
03:26:08,475 --> 03:26:10,520
MATT: 15 just hits.

3116
03:26:10,520 --> 03:26:18,479
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one--
Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23.

3117
03:26:18,479 --> 03:26:19,841
MATT: 23 hits.

3118
03:26:19,841 --> 03:26:27,378
TRAVIS: Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the
fire damage. Oh!

3119
03:26:27,378 --> 03:26:28,831
LAURA: Actually that's 30.

3120
03:26:28,831 --> 03:26:37,231
TRAVIS: Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And
13, 16, 26 for the second one.

3121
03:26:37,231 --> 03:26:42,446
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up, you can see, it's
pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide

3122
03:26:42,446 --> 03:26:47,049
arc towards Vax. As soon as you rush up, it looks
to you out of the corner of the eye, drops the

3123
03:26:47,049 --> 03:26:52,458
mace and before the mace can hit the ground, your
hammer actually swings around, hits the mace, and

3124
03:26:52,458 --> 03:26:57,244
then both your hammer and the mace slam into the
side of his head, pushing him down onto the desk.

3125
03:26:57,244 --> 03:27:04,012
Stunned, blood spatters across the wood as he's
(gasping) twitching on the table, already done.

3126
03:27:04,012 --> 03:27:10,973
And you swing the hammer, lift it up, (impact
sound), like Gallagher performance, the head just

3127
03:27:10,973 --> 03:27:12,225
(explosion noise).

3128
03:27:12,225 --> 03:27:14,481
(groaning)

3129
03:27:14,481 --> 03:27:16,233
LAURA: This is disgusting.

3130
03:27:16,233 --> 03:27:19,337
LIAM: Happy Halloween, folks.

3131
03:27:19,337 --> 03:27:23,033
TRAVIS: Great weapon master.

3132
03:27:23,033 --> 03:27:28,782
MATT: Vouk is currently looking very--

3133
03:27:28,782 --> 03:27:30,216
SAM: He's Vouk-ed.

3134
03:27:30,216 --> 03:27:44,094
MATT: Yeah, he's Vouk-ed. All right. Is going to
cast Haste on himself and is going to run,

3135
03:27:44,121 --> 03:27:48,419
dropping invisibility, and leaping through that
window.

3136
03:27:48,419 --> 03:27:50,374
LAURA: Doesn't the guard get a--

3137
03:27:50,374 --> 03:27:53,133
MATT: The guard gets an attack of opportunity, and
Keyleth does.

3138
03:27:53,133 --> 03:27:58,943
The guard has advantage. A three. No, the
guard misses, with a mace.

3139
03:27:58,943 --> 03:28:00,343
MARISHA: Natural 20.

3140
03:28:00,343 --> 03:28:01,844
LAURA: Yeah! With your fire hands?

3141
03:28:01,844 --> 03:28:07,483
MARISHA: No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming,
right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.

3142
03:28:07,483 --> 03:28:08,894
MATT: No, this would be with your staff.

3143
03:28:08,894 --> 03:28:09,981
MARISHA: This is with my staff, okay.

3144
03:28:09,981 --> 03:28:11,737
MATT: You just (whack).

3145
03:28:11,737 --> 03:28:24,033
MARISHA: So it's five, so that's 11. I don't
attack a lot. 13 damage.

3146
03:28:24,033 --> 03:28:25,697
MATT: 13 damage?

3147
03:28:25,697 --> 03:28:27,075
MARISHA: Yeah.

3148
03:28:27,075 --> 03:28:30,750
MATT: All righty. As you smack him at that
point--

3149
03:28:30,750 --> 03:28:33,357
MARISHA: I just clothesline him. I see him
running, I'm like (grunts).

3150
03:28:33,357 --> 03:28:35,071
MATT: It brings him exactly to zero.

3151
03:28:35,071 --> 03:28:36,471
(cheering)

3152
03:28:36,471 --> 03:28:42,488
MATT: You whack him right in the face, knocking
the teeth out, and he just falls to the ground.

3153
03:28:42,488 --> 03:28:46,638
Unconscious and bleeding.

3154
03:28:46,638 --> 03:28:48,265
SAM: Good, yes, keep him alive.

3155
03:28:48,265 --> 03:29:01,549
MATT: All right. That ends his turn (laughs). Wow.
Man. Surprise rounds, man. You guys are nasty. All

3156
03:29:01,549 --> 03:29:04,295
right. Scanlan, you're up.

3157
03:29:04,295 --> 03:29:05,445
SAM: Scanlan's up?

3158
03:29:05,445 --> 03:29:06,457
MATT: Yeah.

3159
03:29:06,457 --> 03:29:13,319
SAM: All right. I go run up to the guard I have
dominated, and I just-- Is he still dominated, can

3160
03:29:13,319 --> 03:29:14,780
I change the domination?

3161
03:29:14,780 --> 03:29:17,429
MATT: I mean, you can cancel it, but otherwise
he's just--

3162
03:29:17,429 --> 03:29:21,149
SAM: I mean, can I change it from "kill your boss"
to--

3163
03:29:21,149 --> 03:29:22,150
TRAVIS: "Kill yourself."

3164
03:29:22,150 --> 03:29:23,623
SAM: To "give up"?

3165
03:29:23,623 --> 03:29:27,989
MATT: Yeah, you can tell him. You can't tell him
to attack himself.

3166
03:29:27,989 --> 03:29:29,330
SAM: No, I will tell him--

3167
03:29:29,330 --> 03:29:32,280
TALIESIN: You-- Oh, go ahead.

3168
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:33,299
SAM: No, what?

3169
03:29:33,299 --> 03:29:36,392
TALIESIN: I was going to say, tell him to go tell
anybody else in the house everything's fine.

3170
03:29:36,392 --> 03:29:38,257
SAM: Oh. Ooh! That's good.

3171
03:29:38,257 --> 03:29:41,817
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we should kill the more
powerful guy.

3172
03:29:41,817 --> 03:29:43,469
TALIESIN: Tell him that everything's fine.

3173
03:29:43,469 --> 03:29:49,346
SAM: Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that
everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out

3174
03:29:49,346 --> 03:29:53,130
there and tell all your friends that everything's
hunky-dory.

3175
03:29:53,130 --> 03:29:55,937
MATT: Technically, Stinking Cloud is a
concentration spell.

3176
03:29:55,996 --> 03:29:57,202
SAM: Is it?

3177
03:29:57,202 --> 03:30:00,146
MATT: So if you were to maintain concentration on
that, you would lose your Domination.

3178
03:30:00,146 --> 03:30:01,157
SAM: Oh, okay.

3179
03:30:01,157 --> 03:30:03,078
MATT: So it's your call. Which one do you want to
maintain?

3180
03:30:03,078 --> 03:30:05,164
SAM: The domination.

3181
03:30:05,164 --> 03:30:07,246
MATT: Okay. So the Stinking Cloud fades from the
hallway.

3182
03:30:07,246 --> 03:30:10,555
SAM: Stinking Cloud is concentration?

3183
03:30:10,555 --> 03:30:13,213
MATT: I believe it is. Spells like that usually
are, if it's to maintain--

3184
03:30:13,213 --> 03:30:15,852
SAM: It is! I never wrote down a C next to it.

3185
03:30:15,852 --> 03:30:18,569
MATT: This is where that circlet would come in
handy.

3186
03:30:18,569 --> 03:30:22,320
TALIESIN: Can I run over to Kerrion's body?

3187
03:30:22,320 --> 03:30:24,550
MATT: You will be able to shortly.

3188
03:30:24,550 --> 03:30:28,333
SAM: You mean the thing that Orion took from me?
Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah.

3189
03:30:28,417 --> 03:30:31,205
MATT: It's all right. He's used it pretty well a
couple of times.

3190
03:30:31,205 --> 03:30:38,436
SAM: Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends--
not warn his friends. Tell his friends that

3191
03:30:38,436 --> 03:30:40,170
everything's fine. All is good.

3192
03:30:40,170 --> 03:30:48,208
MATT: Cool. Good to know. That ends your turn. Is
anyone going to take any specific actions?

3193
03:30:48,208 --> 03:30:50,619
LAURA: I want to loot the bodies.

3194
03:30:50,619 --> 03:30:54,404
TALIESIN: I'm running over to Kerrion and just
going to rage loot him.

3195
03:30:54,404 --> 03:30:56,966
SAM: I'm going to go to the desk.

3196
03:30:56,966 --> 03:31:06,515
MATT: Okay. While you guys all do that, the guard
leaves the room. You hear a few whispers in the

3197
03:31:06,515 --> 03:31:09,614
hallway, a conversation with a person unseen.

3198
03:31:09,614 --> 03:31:14,858
LIAM: I walk towards the door.

3199
03:31:14,858 --> 03:31:16,708
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

3200
03:31:16,708 --> 03:31:20,717
SAM: A giant attacks.

3201
03:31:20,717 --> 03:31:29,688
MATT: The conversation fades and the guard walks
back, seemingly job done. Also is going to make a

3202
03:31:29,688 --> 03:31:32,767
wisdom saving throw. That is a 17?

3203
03:31:32,767 --> 03:31:33,660
SAM: 19.

3204
03:31:33,660 --> 03:31:42,573
MATT: He remains dominated. You guys now-- For the
moment, the threat seems to have subsided. At the

3205
03:31:42,573 --> 03:31:48,277
moment. You're still in the house and there's
still, apparently, things in the house. Whether

3206
03:31:48,277 --> 03:31:52,014
it'd be guards or other individuals in the house
that are on edge as they heard a series of

3207
03:31:52,014 --> 03:32:01,631
gunshots ring out, screams, and other sorts of
cacophony. The fact that this is even right now

3208
03:32:01,631 --> 03:32:06,718
being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on
his part.

3209
03:32:06,718 --> 03:32:11,371
TRAVIS: I want it said that this one should die.
He has magic. He's too strong. They could set

3210
03:32:11,371 --> 03:32:12,645
better traps.

3211
03:32:12,645 --> 03:32:17,294
SAM: We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial
information. He's an officer.

3212
03:32:17,294 --> 03:32:18,767
TALIESIN: I can't talk yet.

3213
03:32:18,767 --> 03:32:20,294
MATT: So you're going through Sir Kerrion's body.

3214
03:32:20,294 --> 03:32:25,430
TALIESIN: I'm taking his swords, and I'm going to
use his sword to get that deep

3215
03:32:25,430 --> 03:32:26,921
gouge into the gun.

3216
03:32:26,921 --> 03:32:31,179
MATT: He has two rapiers, so it's like holding a
stiletto.

3217
03:32:31,179 --> 03:32:35,772
TALIESIN: And anything he has on his body, I'm
taking it.

3218
03:32:35,772 --> 03:32:41,507
MATT: He has a potion of greater healing on him.
Never got round to actually using it.

3219
03:32:41,507 --> 03:32:48,629
TALIESIN: And once there's a good gash in the
name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.

3220
03:32:48,629 --> 03:32:54,148
MATT: Okay. As you finish gashing the name out on
the side of the metal and start breathing, you can

3221
03:32:54,148 --> 03:33:01,333
see the name itself begin to glow with a slight
dull purple glow and burn away from the metal,

3222
03:33:01,333 --> 03:33:14,038
leaving just the scratch marks. From his body, you
have two rapiers, regular rapiers, studded leather

3223
03:33:14,038 --> 03:33:18,861
armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus, and
that potion of greater healing. So you can mark

3224
03:33:18,861 --> 03:33:19,966
those down.

3225
03:33:19,966 --> 03:33:21,938
LAURA: I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy
right now.

3226
03:33:21,938 --> 03:33:22,854
MATT: Okay.

3227
03:33:22,854 --> 03:33:25,416
SAM: Anything on the desk, papers of any sort?

3228
03:33:25,416 --> 03:33:28,558
MATT: Going through the desk? Go ahead and make an
investigation check.

3229
03:33:28,558 --> 03:33:32,347
SAM: It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27.

3230
03:33:32,347 --> 03:33:44,376
MATT: Yeah. You find wax seals, you find
parchment, you find pocket change, about six or

3231
03:33:44,376 --> 03:33:48,776
seven gold pieces just left in there. On himself
though, on his actual person, on Sir Kerrion's

3232
03:33:48,776 --> 03:34:02,098
body, you find about 320 gold pieces as his own
personal fund. Looking through the desk, you find

3233
03:34:02,098 --> 03:34:09,246
mentions of the bridge plan to move between the
two continents. To go across the channel to

3234
03:34:09,246 --> 03:34:15,780
Wildmount. Basically plans, the discussion, a lot
of what they were planning to do with Emon.

3235
03:34:15,780 --> 03:34:18,263
MARISHA: Someone write that down.

3236
03:34:18,263 --> 03:34:19,630
SAM: I got it.

3237
03:34:19,630 --> 03:34:23,507
MATT: You also find a small notebook that just has
some hand notes of his.

3238
03:34:23,507 --> 03:34:25,204
SAM: I'll take it.

3239
03:34:25,204 --> 03:34:27,149
MATT: Okay. So mark that down.

3240
03:34:27,149 --> 03:34:32,307
TRAVIS: I start tying up unconscious guy on the
floor.

3241
03:34:32,307 --> 03:34:35,611
MATT: He's currently-- He's got to zero hit
points, he's bleeding out.

3242
03:34:35,611 --> 03:34:41,333
MARISHA: What about the dominated guy? He's about
to save from it. Domination, he can save from it

3243
03:34:41,333 --> 03:34:42,449
at any second.

3244
03:34:42,449 --> 03:34:45,173
TRAVIS: No, I know. I thought we wanted to
interrogate--

3245
03:34:45,173 --> 03:34:47,407
MATT: Which he does not; he's still dominated.

3246
03:34:47,407 --> 03:34:52,034
LIAM: I take a rag out of my pocket and I roll it
up and I shove it into Kerrion's mouth while Grog

3247
03:34:52,034 --> 03:34:53,207
is tying him up.

3248
03:34:53,207 --> 03:34:54,444
TALIESIN: Kerrion's dead.

3249
03:34:54,444 --> 03:34:55,623
LIAM: I thought he was out.

3250
03:34:55,623 --> 03:34:57,029
SAM: Vouk's.

3251
03:34:57,029 --> 03:34:58,366
TRAVIS: The balding guy.

3252
03:34:58,366 --> 03:34:59,449
LIAM: Balding. All right.

3253
03:34:59,449 --> 03:35:03,510
TRAVIS: We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his
mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and

3254
03:35:03,510 --> 03:35:06,904
the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him
back just a little so we can ask him some

3255
03:35:06,904 --> 03:35:07,905
questions?

3256
03:35:07,905 --> 03:35:08,824
MARISHA: Vouk?

3257
03:35:08,824 --> 03:35:09,778
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3258
03:35:09,778 --> 03:35:13,056
MARISHA: Okay, but what are we going to do about
dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too?

3259
03:35:13,125 --> 03:35:15,456
LAURA: Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner,
Scanlan.

3260
03:35:15,456 --> 03:35:18,510
MARISHA: He could save from that any second. We
need to like off him or something.

3261
03:35:18,510 --> 03:35:19,594
TALIESIN: There'll be time for that.

3262
03:35:19,594 --> 03:35:22,117
LIAM: I got it. Could you tell him to look in the
corner?

3263
03:35:22,117 --> 03:35:26,822
SAM: Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch
style.

3264
03:35:26,822 --> 03:35:29,622
(laughter)

3265
03:35:29,622 --> 03:35:34,304
LAURA: Oh, this is so wrong.

3266
03:35:34,304 --> 03:35:35,851
MATT: Doesn't make his save.

3267
03:35:35,851 --> 03:35:36,839
LAURA: Oh, terrible.

3268
03:35:36,839 --> 03:35:38,278
SAM: Grog, do you want to?

3269
03:35:38,278 --> 03:35:39,893
LAURA: No, this is so wrong.

3270
03:35:39,893 --> 03:35:46,839
TRAVIS: What? We're asking questions. We got to
bring him back, just a little bit.

3271
03:35:46,839 --> 03:35:48,469
SAM: Are you on Vouk's right? Or
whatever-his-name?

3272
03:35:48,469 --> 03:35:49,679
TRAVIS: We're on Vouk.

3273
03:35:49,679 --> 03:35:53,280
LIAM: Can we put him to sleep, or anything short
of me knocking him out?

3274
03:35:53,280 --> 03:35:55,109
SAM: I can put him to sleep.

3275
03:35:55,109 --> 03:35:56,423
LIAM: Put him to sleep, then.

3276
03:35:56,423 --> 03:35:58,363
SAM: But I have to drop my thing first.

3277
03:35:58,363 --> 03:36:00,047
LAURA: Just knock him out.

3278
03:36:00,047 --> 03:36:03,951
LIAM: I'll do it. I'm really good at knocking
people out.

3279
03:36:03,951 --> 03:36:09,530
MARISHA: Just knock him out. Knowing what's
coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty

3280
03:36:09,530 --> 03:36:14,980
kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face.
Pretty image before you die.

3281
03:36:14,980 --> 03:36:21,839
MATT: All right. He seems momentarily confused
before the blow of the-- Are you hitting him with

3282
03:36:21,839 --> 03:36:22,883
the blade or pommel?

3283
03:36:22,883 --> 03:36:23,908
LIAM: Oh, pommel.

3284
03:36:23,908 --> 03:36:27,750
TRAVIS: Before we knock him out, should you make
sure that whatever he tells people is truly

3285
03:36:27,750 --> 03:36:30,640
fearsome? But not too descript about us?

3286
03:36:30,640 --> 03:36:33,459
SAM: Well, he already told his friends in the
hallway--

3287
03:36:33,459 --> 03:36:34,556
TRAVIS: That everything was fine.

3288
03:36:34,556 --> 03:36:36,813
SAM: That everything's fine. So now we're just
knocking him out.

3289
03:36:36,813 --> 03:36:45,569
MARISHA: While all this happens, I'm going over to
baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure

3290
03:36:45,569 --> 03:36:51,620
Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was
just at zero. I brought him to zero.

3291
03:36:51,620 --> 03:36:56,119
MATT: Yeah, he was unconscious and he was making
his death saving throws. I was treating him for

3292
03:36:56,119 --> 03:36:59,025
that circumstance. When you go straight to zero
like that, you know--

3293
03:36:59,025 --> 03:37:00,981
MARISHA: Yeah. All right, I'll pop a Cure Wounds
into him.

3294
03:37:00,981 --> 03:37:02,015
MATT: Okay.

3295
03:37:02,015 --> 03:37:05,928
LIAM: The guy in the corner? Scanlan, could you go
stand next to him and tell him a joke?

3296
03:37:05,928 --> 03:37:08,797
MARISHA: I was giving him pretty flowers.

3297
03:37:08,797 --> 03:37:10,619
LIAM: You're standing next to him?

3298
03:37:10,619 --> 03:37:13,717
MARISHA: I gave him pretty flowers to look at.

3299
03:37:13,717 --> 03:37:15,069
LIAM: You walked over and gave him pretty
flowers?

3300
03:37:15,069 --> 03:37:16,528
MARISHA: I Druidcrafted from a distance.

3301
03:37:16,528 --> 03:37:18,105
TRAVIS: Are you standing next to him?

3302
03:37:18,105 --> 03:37:21,722
SAM: I walk next to him and sort of distract him
with a little soft shoe tap.

3303
03:37:21,722 --> 03:37:39,092
LIAM: Thank you. That's what I needed. I got an
18. Sorry, I got a 29. And that is eight plus 14,

3304
03:37:39,092 --> 03:37:44,750
22, six, seven, 32.

3305
03:37:44,825 --> 03:37:53,927
MATT: 32. He is (impact noise) from barely damaged
to nothing. He goes immediately unconscious in the

3306
03:37:53,927 --> 03:37:56,710
corner, face down, in the middle of a bookcase.

3307
03:37:56,710 --> 03:38:02,559
MARISHA: I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk.

3308
03:38:02,559 --> 03:38:11,311
MATT: Okay. (gasps, chokes)

3309
03:38:11,311 --> 03:38:16,601
TRAVIS: The rag's in his throat. You are going to
listen very carefully as my friends ask you some

3310
03:38:16,601 --> 03:38:20,799
questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it
no.

3311
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:28,056
LAURA: What are we going to ask him?

3312
03:38:28,056 --> 03:38:30,163
SAM: (laughs) Percy?

3313
03:38:30,163 --> 03:38:33,344
TALIESIN: I'm not available right now.

3314
03:38:33,344 --> 03:38:35,211
SAM and LIAM: All right.

3315
03:38:35,211 --> 03:38:36,440
LIAM: Come on. Come with me.

3316
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:37,582
LAURA: Okay.

3317
03:38:37,582 --> 03:38:39,022
SAM: Where are the Briarwoods?

3318
03:38:39,022 --> 03:38:40,091
LAURA: Where are the Briarwoods?

3319
03:38:40,091 --> 03:38:41,383
LIAM: You've got to do yes or no.

3320
03:38:41,383 --> 03:38:42,457
LAURA: Are the Briarwoods--

3321
03:38:42,457 --> 03:38:45,420
SAM: -- in the palace?

3322
03:38:45,420 --> 03:38:46,784
MATT: (muffled moaning)

3323
03:38:46,784 --> 03:38:47,866
LIAM: Yes or no.

3324
03:38:47,866 --> 03:38:49,071
SAM: Just nod or nod.

3325
03:38:49,071 --> 03:38:50,911
LAURA: This is really smart. I feel good about
this.

3326
03:38:50,911 --> 03:38:52,055
TRAVIS: Should we take the rag out?

3327
03:38:52,055 --> 03:38:53,199
LAURA: No.

3328
03:38:53,199 --> 03:38:54,442
SAM: He can do spells.

3329
03:38:54,442 --> 03:38:58,297
LIAM: I just want to remind you that my friend
over here can split you in

3330
03:38:58,297 --> 03:39:00,461
half like an apple, right?

3331
03:39:00,461 --> 03:39:03,016
TRAVIS: I nod his head yes.

3332
03:39:03,016 --> 03:39:04,959
MATT: (muffled murmur)

3333
03:39:04,959 --> 03:39:07,626
LIAM: Have you seen the Briarwoods this week?

3334
03:39:07,626 --> 03:39:09,424
MATT: (affirmative grunt)

3335
03:39:09,424 --> 03:39:12,828
LIAM: Do you like working for them?

3336
03:39:12,828 --> 03:39:16,022
MATT: (sounds uncertain)

3337
03:39:16,022 --> 03:39:17,853
LAURA: Do they know we're here?

3338
03:39:17,853 --> 03:39:19,328
MATT: (affirmative grunt)

3339
03:39:19,328 --> 03:39:21,566
LAURA: Yeah.

3340
03:39:21,566 --> 03:39:23,442
SAM: Are they in the palace?

3341
03:39:23,442 --> 03:39:25,396
MATT: (sounds ambiguous)

3342
03:39:25,396 --> 03:39:26,468
SAM: Sometimes.

3343
03:39:26,468 --> 03:39:28,460
LAURA: Do you know where they are?

3344
03:39:28,460 --> 03:39:30,363
MATT: (negative grunt)

3345
03:39:30,363 --> 03:39:33,639
LIAM: Do they have pointier teeth than most?

3346
03:39:33,715 --> 03:39:36,336
MATT: (sounds ambiguous)

3347
03:39:36,336 --> 03:39:38,288
SAM: (laughs)

3348
03:39:38,288 --> 03:39:39,940
MATT: (sounds sad)

3349
03:39:39,940 --> 03:39:41,259
SAM: This is mumblecore.

3350
03:39:41,259 --> 03:39:42,445
LAURA: Yeah.

3351
03:39:42,445 --> 03:39:46,467
LIAM: Is your life worth giving a little
information?

3352
03:39:46,467 --> 03:39:48,905
MATT: (affirmative grunting)

3353
03:39:48,905 --> 03:39:55,237
LIAM: We want to know how to get into the palace
without a problem. Got any advice?

3354
03:39:55,237 --> 03:39:57,919
MATT: (eager affirmative grunting)

3355
03:39:57,919 --> 03:40:03,506
LIAM: Now I just want to remind you. He can take
your head off, your knees off, your cock off,

3356
03:40:03,506 --> 03:40:05,249
anything, in half a second.

3357
03:40:05,249 --> 03:40:07,008
TRAVIS: I just give a little squeeze.

3358
03:40:07,008 --> 03:40:10,119
LIAM: I'm going to pull the cloth out.

3359
03:40:10,119 --> 03:40:11,985
SAM: I cast Blindness on him.

3360
03:40:11,985 --> 03:40:13,494
MATT: Okay.

3361
03:40:13,494 --> 03:40:20,934
SAM: Don't know if he's blind.

3362
03:40:20,934 --> 03:40:23,380
MATT: Suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises).

3363
03:40:23,380 --> 03:40:24,995
SAM: Oh, he's blind. He's blind.

3364
03:40:24,995 --> 03:40:26,945
LIAM: I give him a pat on the cheek.

3365
03:40:26,945 --> 03:40:28,341
MATT: (whimpers)

3366
03:40:28,341 --> 03:40:29,522
LAURA: Oh, now I feel bad.

3367
03:40:29,522 --> 03:40:33,371
LIAM: I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I'm going to
pull this rag out and you've got about 30 seconds

3368
03:40:33,371 --> 03:40:38,141
to start talking about something useful.
Otherwise, my friend is going to make you about

3369
03:40:38,141 --> 03:40:39,533
six inches shorter.

3370
03:40:39,533 --> 03:40:42,014
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a
dreidel.

3371
03:40:42,014 --> 03:40:45,483
LIAM: So we're going to start talking now, yes?

3372
03:40:45,527 --> 03:40:47,450
MATT: (grunts in agreement)

3373
03:40:47,450 --> 03:40:49,780
LIAM: In three, two.

3374
03:40:49,780 --> 03:40:58,308
MATT: (gasping for breath) "Please don't kill me.
I can show you a secret entrance into the castle.

3375
03:40:58,308 --> 03:41:00,038
"I know a way in."

3376
03:41:00,038 --> 03:41:01,488
LAURA: It's not guarded?

3377
03:41:01,488 --> 03:41:07,468
MATT: "I don't think so. They've closed it off. If
you can find a way through, they won't expect it."

3378
03:41:07,468 --> 03:41:09,923
TALIESIN: Is it the one in the forest?

3379
03:41:09,923 --> 03:41:17,475
MATT: "There is one, yes, yes, in the forest.
Look, I can bring you to their project room under

3380
03:41:17,475 --> 03:41:21,421
"the castle, what they're working on. Please don't
kill me."

3381
03:41:21,421 --> 03:41:23,267
LAURA: What is the project room?

3382
03:41:23,267 --> 03:41:25,188
SAM: Are they working on explosives?

3383
03:41:25,188 --> 03:41:34,999
MATT: "They've been-- They've been working on
something. It's hard to describe. I've only been

3384
03:41:34,999 --> 03:41:40,110
"there once. It's beyond my interests, but it is
part of the reason they even took this place."

3385
03:41:40,110 --> 03:41:44,230
LIAM: Lord Briarwood is a vampire.

3386
03:41:44,230 --> 03:41:46,287
MATT: "Aye."

3387
03:41:46,287 --> 03:41:49,151
LIAM: What the fuck is Lady Briarwood?

3388
03:41:49,151 --> 03:41:54,846
MATT: "She's powerful, I'll give you that. She
scares me more than the two of them."

3389
03:41:54,899 --> 03:42:01,220
LAURA: Is it hard to talk with no teeth?

3390
03:42:01,220 --> 03:42:04,693
MATT: "It's more difficult than expected, aye."

3391
03:42:04,693 --> 03:42:11,592
TRAVIS: I start to tilt his head and I'm like:
showing us won't work, we need a location.

3392
03:42:11,592 --> 03:42:21,275
MATT: "It's under the castle. It's under the city.
All the caverns are there. I can show you how to

3393
03:42:21,275 --> 03:42:23,889
"get there, I've been there. They've taken me."

3394
03:42:23,889 --> 03:42:30,135
LAURA: Do you know what they've done to the ground
here? Do you know why nothing grows?

3395
03:42:30,135 --> 03:42:33,058
MATT: "Stuff grows. It's how we do the farming."

3396
03:42:33,058 --> 03:42:38,993
MARISHA: Stuff doesn't <i>grow,</i> though. Not like it
should. What did they do to the land?

3397
03:42:38,993 --> 03:42:42,427
MATT: "I don't know. Maybe it has something to do
with what they're doing under the castle."

3398
03:42:42,427 --> 03:42:45,371
MARISHA: And what exactly are they doing under the
castle?

3399
03:42:45,371 --> 03:42:51,839
MATT: "It's an excavation, or they're building
something. I don't know the details of it."

3400
03:42:51,839 --> 03:42:54,728
LIAM: You've no idea what they want?

3401
03:42:54,728 --> 03:43:04,284
MATT: "Comparatively, I'm just a peasant to them.
I work with-- well, I <i>worked</i> with Kerrion."

3402
03:43:04,284 --> 03:43:10,677
TALIESIN: How long have you worked with Sir
Stonefell?

3403
03:43:10,677 --> 03:43:12,738
MATT: "Five years."

3404
03:43:12,738 --> 03:43:15,347
TALIESIN: Were you here when he took the castle?

3405
03:43:15,347 --> 03:43:18,311
MATT: "Yes, yes. I was part of the incursion."

3406
03:43:18,311 --> 03:43:27,413
TALIESIN: Good. You're very lucky. Because you're
going to live if you show us--

3407
03:43:27,413 --> 03:43:29,482
And I bring out a map.

3408
03:43:29,482 --> 03:43:31,573
SAM: He can't see anything.

3409
03:43:31,573 --> 03:43:34,520
TALIESIN: I know. Drop the Blindness.

3410
03:43:34,520 --> 03:43:36,906
MATT: He hears the crinkling of paper.

3411
03:43:36,906 --> 03:43:38,433
TALIESIN: Drop the Blindness.

3412
03:43:38,433 --> 03:43:41,095
SAM: All right. I drop Blindness and I drop
Seeming.

3413
03:43:41,095 --> 03:43:43,407
MATT: (scared, fast breathing)

3414
03:43:43,407 --> 03:43:50,559
TALIESIN: Look at me. Look at me. You're going to
show me where on the castle is the secret

3415
03:43:50,559 --> 03:43:53,904
entrance. Do you know who I am?

3416
03:43:53,904 --> 03:43:55,356
MATT: "No."

3417
03:43:55,356 --> 03:43:59,517
TALIESIN: You will. Mark it on the map.

3418
03:43:59,517 --> 03:44:02,292
MATT: He looks down at his bound arms and legs.

3419
03:44:02,292 --> 03:44:07,362
TRAVIS: I take his head and I shove his nose and
his face right above the map. And I say:

3420
03:44:07,421 --> 03:44:09,153
use your nose.

3421
03:44:09,153 --> 03:44:20,769
MATT: "It's right--" He spits and puts a little
droplet. It's loosely in the area of the western

3422
03:44:20,769 --> 03:44:26,760
side of the mountain that the castle is built on.
Roughly around the entrance where you escaped when

3423
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:30,524
you and Cassandra left Whitestone, five years
before.

3424
03:44:30,524 --> 03:44:32,497
TALIESIN: I know where that is.

3425
03:44:32,497 --> 03:44:35,509
TRAVIS: That means we don't need you anymore.

3426
03:44:35,509 --> 03:44:41,890
MATT: "No! I can show you-- I can show you where
their project is. The tunnels. You need me."

3427
03:44:41,890 --> 03:44:44,885
TRAVIS: He'll set a good trap.

3428
03:44:44,885 --> 03:44:49,982
LAURA: I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods
come out?

3429
03:44:49,982 --> 03:44:59,892
MATT: "Not often. They don't need to. Kerrion does
the work for them. Did the work for them."

3430
03:44:59,892 --> 03:45:02,670
SAM: Those giants. Who controls them?

3431
03:45:02,670 --> 03:45:05,648
MATT: "Lady Briarwood does. She's the one who made
them."

3432
03:45:05,648 --> 03:45:07,378
TRAVIS: It's all over the room.

3433
03:45:07,378 --> 03:45:09,188
MARISHA: She's the one who made them?

3434
03:45:09,188 --> 03:45:10,959
TALIESIN: Can I propose something to you?

3435
03:45:10,959 --> 03:45:13,408
MATT: "She's strong with necromancy, she is."

3436
03:45:13,408 --> 03:45:17,281
LIAM: I shove the rag back in his mouth for a
moment.

3437
03:45:17,356 --> 03:45:20,708
TALIESIN: Mark his face, take his tongue, let him
loose.

3438
03:45:20,708 --> 03:45:22,332
SAM: His eyes, too?

3439
03:45:22,332 --> 03:45:23,967
TALIESIN: No, just his tongue.

3440
03:45:23,967 --> 03:45:25,259
TRAVIS: His tongue?

3441
03:45:25,259 --> 03:45:26,380
TALIESIN: Mark his face.

3442
03:45:26,380 --> 03:45:31,566
TRAVIS: I stick my two fingers inside of his nose,
crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his

3443
03:45:31,566 --> 03:45:32,987
tongue out of his mouth.

3444
03:45:32,987 --> 03:45:34,297
SAM: I cover Keyleth's eyes.

3445
03:45:34,297 --> 03:45:35,961
TALIESIN: That was a bit more than I was--

3446
03:45:35,961 --> 03:45:39,774
TRAVIS: You said take his tongue! That's a
natural 20.

3447
03:45:39,948 --> 03:45:41,904
MARISHA: Natural 20?!

3448
03:45:41,904 --> 03:45:45,504
TALIESIN: Natural 20, really? I'm feeling like
such a bastard right now.

3449
03:45:45,504 --> 03:45:50,698
MATT: There isn't even a slow scuffle. You just
reach in and (wet ripping noise, pained scream)

3450
03:45:50,698 --> 03:45:57,404
You immediately jam the cloth back in. The cloth
begins to slowly soak with blood. You hold almost

3451
03:45:57,404 --> 03:46:04,741
a pound of muscle: a now motionless tongue in your
hand, bloody at its base. These tears are running

3452
03:46:04,741 --> 03:46:08,851
down his face. (muffled sobbing and coughing)

3453
03:46:08,851 --> 03:46:12,375
TRAVIS: Is that good enough for your message?

3454
03:46:12,375 --> 03:46:18,596
TALIESIN: I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it
very gently-- I'm going to shoot into the ground

3455
03:46:18,596 --> 03:46:28,023
to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of
it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so

3456
03:46:28,023 --> 03:46:29,190
he doesn't bleed out.

3457
03:46:29,190 --> 03:46:31,825
MATT: You pull the cloth out. (pained cry and
choking sounds)

3458
03:46:31,825 --> 03:46:36,614
TALIESIN: I'm going to mark his head with the
still-hot gun.

3459
03:46:36,614 --> 03:46:44,460
MATT: (noises of pain) He starts screaming in pain
as you're burning what into his head, the symbol

3460
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:45,876
of the de Rolo family?

3461
03:46:45,876 --> 03:46:48,327
SAM: It's a very complicated symbol. (laughs)

3462
03:46:48,327 --> 03:46:54,504
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it. And then, I say we
let him run out the front door and we set fire to

3463
03:46:54,504 --> 03:46:55,558
the house.

3464
03:46:55,558 --> 03:46:56,969
TRAVIS: I'm good with that. I've got this.

3465
03:46:56,969 --> 03:46:58,010
SAM: Where are we going after this?

3466
03:46:58,010 --> 03:46:59,367
MARISHA: Whoa!

3467
03:46:59,367 --> 03:47:02,835
TRAVIS: No. I like that a lot.

3468
03:47:02,835 --> 03:47:05,072
MARISHA: You would, though. You would.

3469
03:47:05,072 --> 03:47:07,242
SAM: Trinket's downstairs. We should leave
Trinket.

3470
03:47:07,242 --> 03:47:12,816
TRAVIS: Have we forgotten that this entire town is
full of evil, undead vampire people?

3471
03:47:12,816 --> 03:47:16,359
MARISHA: Have we also forgotten that this entire
town is looking for us?

3472
03:47:16,359 --> 03:47:17,903
TALIESIN: They don't know we're here.

3473
03:47:17,903 --> 03:47:23,122
MARISHA: They will after we set fire on the house
and send a man screaming through the street with

3474
03:47:23,122 --> 03:47:24,424
your symbol on his forehead.

3475
03:47:24,424 --> 03:47:26,279
SAM: They don't know where we live.

3476
03:47:26,279 --> 03:47:30,534
MARISHA: They will! They're going to go, "Hm,
let's look at the burning smokestack of a house

3477
03:47:30,534 --> 03:47:31,645
"and start there."

3478
03:47:31,645 --> 03:47:33,395
TALIESIN: He's going to be missing by morning.
They're going to know.

3479
03:47:33,395 --> 03:47:37,379
TRAVIS: We've got the guy painted all over this
room. They're going to find out one way or the

3480
03:47:37,379 --> 03:47:39,686
other. Might as well do it with a little
showmanship.

3481
03:47:39,686 --> 03:47:43,370
SAM: We're trying to make everyone know that we're
here.

3482
03:47:43,370 --> 03:47:45,436
TALIESIN: We're trying to start a rebellion.

3483
03:47:45,436 --> 03:47:47,648
MARISHA: (voice cracking) Yeah, but-- yeah.

3484
03:47:47,648 --> 03:47:50,001
TRAVIS: Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth!

3485
03:47:50,001 --> 03:47:55,050
TALIESIN: (giggles) Don't make me laugh. This is
dark shit.

3486
03:47:55,118 --> 03:47:56,330
TRAVIS: It is!

3487
03:47:56,330 --> 03:47:59,405
SAM: We can stay the night before we release him
and burn it down.

3488
03:47:59,405 --> 03:48:00,381
TALIESIN: Fair.

3489
03:48:00,381 --> 03:48:02,363
SAM: Although there are a bunch of guards around.

3490
03:48:02,363 --> 03:48:03,932
MARISHA and LAURA: We can't stay the night.

3491
03:48:03,932 --> 03:48:06,320
SAM: All right, just burn it, then. Let's get out
of here.

3492
03:48:06,320 --> 03:48:15,328
MARISHA: Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as
horrified as I feel. What do you guys think?

3493
03:48:15,328 --> 03:48:21,461
LAURA: I feel like it's a little stupid, since we
have nowhere to go.

3494
03:48:21,461 --> 03:48:27,926
SAM: We can go back to our old hideout. We have
the tavern. No one's found it.

3495
03:48:27,926 --> 03:48:32,779
LIAM: Percival, I know what you've been through,
to an extent.

3496
03:48:32,779 --> 03:48:37,526
TALIESIN: I don't even know what I've been
through, to a certain extent, but yes.

3497
03:48:37,526 --> 03:48:44,801
LIAM: We came here to wipe out a scourge on this
city. Careful lest you become the scourge you've

3498
03:48:44,801 --> 03:48:53,691
come to destroy. These people have eaten shit for
five years. I'm not saying that man was innocent,

3499
03:48:53,691 --> 03:49:03,913
but he's had a hard road. Everyone here has had a
hard road. I am maybe willing to overlook what's

3500
03:49:03,913 --> 03:49:09,728
just happened for all the hardship you have had,
but careful how you are walking.

3501
03:49:09,728 --> 03:49:17,139
SAM: Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an
enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked

3502
03:49:17,139 --> 03:49:20,910
for the Briarwoods and punished all of these
farmers for not bringing

3503
03:49:20,910 --> 03:49:22,911
enough taxes and enough tithes.

3504
03:49:22,911 --> 03:49:25,113
LIAM: Are we to turn into Jack the Ripper because
of it?

3505
03:49:25,113 --> 03:49:27,016
SAM: Well, that's what a rebellion is.

3506
03:49:27,016 --> 03:49:28,253
TRAVIS: I do like ripping.

3507
03:49:28,253 --> 03:49:30,170
TALIESIN: There's no pretty way to do this.

3508
03:49:30,170 --> 03:49:37,790
LAURA: I'm fully in support with burning down a
house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit.

3509
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:45,832
MARISHA: Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and
let the people have their uprising, but I'm with

3510
03:49:45,832 --> 03:49:51,691
Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even
came here, Percy. You don't want to become the

3511
03:49:51,691 --> 03:49:59,374
thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance
on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods,

3512
03:49:59,374 --> 03:50:00,859
at this point?

3513
03:50:00,859 --> 03:50:06,136
TRAVIS: We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are
our options besides burning the house down? I'm

3514
03:50:06,136 --> 03:50:07,908
open to other ideas.

3515
03:50:07,908 --> 03:50:11,300
SAM: We can just leave it as a symbol of our
terror.

3516
03:50:11,300 --> 03:50:13,253
TALIESIN: I've marked him. I'm willing to walk
away.

3517
03:50:13,253 --> 03:50:14,591
TRAVIS: And where do we stay?

3518
03:50:14,591 --> 03:50:15,839
SAM: Somewhere else.

3519
03:50:15,839 --> 03:50:19,438
TRAVIS: The tavern? Do we have to find another
building?

3520
03:50:19,438 --> 03:50:21,911
TALIESIN: I know a barracks. It's not too far
away.

3521
03:50:21,911 --> 03:50:25,954
LIAM: I agree with you, with burning the house
down. Let's find anyone who's in here

3522
03:50:25,954 --> 03:50:27,344
and get them out.

3523
03:50:27,344 --> 03:50:30,762
TALIESIN: I think they'll get out when the house
catches on fire.

3524
03:50:30,762 --> 03:50:33,641
LIAM: Your soul doesn't need to be forfeit,
Percival.

3525
03:50:33,641 --> 03:50:38,947
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily) Things are more
complicated now.

3526
03:50:38,947 --> 03:50:41,697
SAM: Percy, is that last barrel for you?

3527
03:50:41,697 --> 03:50:45,829
TALIESIN: No. But, if it was, would I tell you?

3528
03:50:45,829 --> 03:50:47,103
SAM: No.

3529
03:50:47,103 --> 03:50:48,419
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3530
03:50:48,419 --> 03:50:54,902
MARISHA: Why are things more complicated, Percy?
Clearly, we all just witnessed what just

3531
03:50:54,902 --> 03:50:55,961
happened.

3532
03:50:55,961 --> 03:51:00,940
TALIESIN: That was unexpected.

3533
03:51:00,940 --> 03:51:04,624
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah.

3534
03:51:04,624 --> 03:51:10,591
TALIESIN: (sighs) That's a longer conversation.

3535
03:51:10,591 --> 03:51:16,733
SAM: These guards aren't going to stay out for
long. We should set fire and get out of here.

3536
03:51:16,733 --> 03:51:20,543
LIAM: We burn the house down, and we find a place
to hole up for the night.

3537
03:51:20,543 --> 03:51:22,281
LAURA: Hey, buddy. How's it going?

3538
03:51:22,281 --> 03:51:26,185
MATT: He looks over at the body of Sir Kerrion,
which is still slumped against the wall.

3539
03:51:26,185 --> 03:51:32,342
LIAM: Percy, we need to have that longer
conversation soon.

3540
03:51:32,342 --> 03:51:34,415
LAURA: Soon, but not now. Let's go.

3541
03:51:34,415 --> 03:51:38,049
MARISHA: Let's get out of here. All right, we're
setting this damn house on fire?

3542
03:51:38,049 --> 03:51:39,377
LAURA: Let's do it.

3543
03:51:39,377 --> 03:51:48,506
TRAVIS: I take the tongue-less one, and I throw
him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the

3544
03:51:48,506 --> 03:51:54,353
chest and hands. And I throw him out the window.
Bye, motherfucker!

3545
03:51:54,353 --> 03:52:03,197
MATT: He falls out into the rain, (boof) falling
on his side. (whimpers) He's being rained on, and

3546
03:52:03,197 --> 03:52:04,575
he's trying to struggle with his bindings.

3547
03:52:04,575 --> 03:52:13,739
TRAVIS: He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs
and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.

3548
03:52:13,739 --> 03:52:15,727
MATT: Okay, then he gets to his feet and starts
running.

3549
03:52:15,727 --> 03:52:19,498
SAM: Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard
out on our way out?

3550
03:52:19,498 --> 03:52:21,182
TRAVIS: Sure. Do I kill him first?

3551
03:52:21,182 --> 03:52:22,661
MATT: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body?

3552
03:52:22,661 --> 03:52:23,821
SAM: Sir Kerrion's body?

3553
03:52:23,821 --> 03:52:25,406
MATT: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body to burn
with the house?

3554
03:52:25,406 --> 03:52:26,222
TALIESIN: Yes.

3555
03:52:26,222 --> 03:52:27,028
LAURA: Are we?

3556
03:52:27,028 --> 03:52:28,841
TALIESIN: Let's take him, too.

3557
03:52:28,841 --> 03:52:34,975
TRAVIS: We might as well leave him out on the
front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion--

3558
03:52:34,975 --> 03:52:36,571
SAM: Can you carry both of those fuckers?

3559
03:52:36,571 --> 03:52:37,739
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3560
03:52:37,739 --> 03:52:39,073
MATT: He threw one of them out.

3561
03:52:39,073 --> 03:52:41,163
SAM: No, there's the unconscious guard and the
body.

3562
03:52:41,163 --> 03:52:43,502
TRAVIS: I'll grab unconscious guard and the body.

3563
03:52:43,502 --> 03:52:45,184
LIAM: He weighs like 600 pounds.

3564
03:52:45,184 --> 03:52:50,712
MARISHA: I'm going to say: All right. Well, if
we're going to light this damn house on fire and

3565
03:52:50,712 --> 03:52:52,103
make it a symbol--

3566
03:52:52,103 --> 03:52:53,406
SAM: You have fire hands.

3567
03:52:53,406 --> 03:52:57,152
MARISHA: We're at least going to make it cool and
make it the message that it's supposed to be.

3568
03:52:57,152 --> 03:52:58,296
TRAVIS: There you go!

3569
03:52:58,296 --> 03:53:01,610
MARISHA: I turn into an eagle and I fly to the
roof.

3570
03:53:01,610 --> 03:53:04,275
MATT: Flying out the window that you just
shattered.

3571
03:53:04,275 --> 03:53:07,659
MARISHA: Give me your symbol.

3572
03:53:07,659 --> 03:53:09,423
TALIESIN: I give her one of the parchments.

3573
03:53:09,423 --> 03:53:15,706
MATT: You fly up. The rain is coming down on you.
It's a little hard to fly. You get up to the top

3574
03:53:15,706 --> 03:53:16,769
of the roof.

3575
03:53:16,769 --> 03:53:20,235
MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere.

3576
03:53:20,235 --> 03:53:22,015
MATT: You transform into yourself again?

3577
03:53:22,015 --> 03:53:23,098
MARISHA: Yeah.

3578
03:53:23,098 --> 03:53:24,388
MATT: All righty.

3579
03:53:24,388 --> 03:53:28,348
TALIESIN: We're all going to start going out the
way we came.

3580
03:53:28,348 --> 03:53:34,336
TRAVIS: I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead.

3581
03:53:34,336 --> 03:53:36,119
MARISHA: Hope you guys were ready to get out.

3582
03:53:36,119 --> 03:53:38,436
LAURA: I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant
swig.

3583
03:53:38,436 --> 03:53:41,950
MATT: Okay. As you guys head back down to the
cellar?

3584
03:53:41,950 --> 03:53:43,819
LAURA: Yeah.

3585
03:53:43,819 --> 03:53:47,070
MATT: You guys all head back down to the cellar.
You throw them both out the window, including the body

3586
03:53:47,246 --> 03:53:50,580
of Sir Kerrion (boof) out into the yard. You head
back down into the cellar.

3587
03:53:50,658 --> 03:53:56,980
MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving
it around on the roof and start drawing the shape

3588
03:53:56,980 --> 03:53:59,311
of the de Rolo family crest on the roof.

3589
03:53:59,311 --> 03:54:10,825
MATT: Okay. It will take you a few minutes. You
now see, as you're finishing the symbol, Vouk

3590
03:54:10,825 --> 03:54:18,062
running to the front of the building, and you hear
the voices of two guards going, "Master Vouk? What

3591
03:54:18,062 --> 03:54:24,671
"happened? Tell us. Unbind him!" "Yes, sir." And
the two guards at the front of the building are

3592
03:54:24,671 --> 03:54:26,862
talking with him. You finish the symbol.

3593
03:54:26,862 --> 03:54:33,007
MARISHA: And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw
it right at the feet of where the guards are.

3594
03:54:33,007 --> 03:54:36,844
MATT: Okay. You're on the roof, so you don't see
them, but you know they're off to the side of the

3595
03:54:36,844 --> 03:54:41,967
roof, so you can roll it off the roof down to
them. They both freak out and react and seem to

3596
03:54:41,967 --> 03:54:47,525
get into a defensive position. They start arming
themselves, and you hear crossbow bolts being set

3597
03:54:47,525 --> 03:54:48,629
into place.

3598
03:54:48,629 --> 03:54:53,831
MARISHA: I run over to the edge where the cellar
was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog!

3599
03:54:53,831 --> 03:54:54,874
TRAVIS: What?

3600
03:54:54,874 --> 03:54:56,498
MARISHA: (whispering) Come to the side of the
roof!

3601
03:54:56,498 --> 03:54:59,575
MATT: You guys make your ways back down through
the cellar, where Trinket's waiting patiently.

3602
03:54:59,575 --> 03:55:00,898
(bear grunts)

3603
03:55:00,898 --> 03:55:02,391
LAURA: Hey, buddy. Let's go.

3604
03:55:02,391 --> 03:55:03,898
TRAVIS: Hi, Trinket. Get out.

3605
03:55:03,898 --> 03:55:05,440
MATT: You guys come out of the cellar now.

3606
03:55:05,440 --> 03:55:07,247
MARISHA: (whispering) Grog! Hey!

3607
03:55:07,247 --> 03:55:08,436
TRAVIS: What?

3608
03:55:08,436 --> 03:55:09,409
MARISHA: (whispering) Catch me!

3609
03:55:09,409 --> 03:55:10,582
TRAVIS: Okay!

3610
03:55:10,582 --> 03:55:16,920
MATT: Catch Keyleth. You guys are now out in the
open, still during the day, rain pouring down.

3611
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:20,076
LAURA: Running toward the woods? Where are we
running?

3612
03:55:20,076 --> 03:55:21,389
MARISHA: Get the fuck out of here.

3613
03:55:21,389 --> 03:55:25,010
TALIESIN: Let's head back to the inn. Let's try
the barracks. We'll try the barracks.

3614
03:55:25,010 --> 03:55:26,434
MATT: The barracks are attached to the castle.

3615
03:55:26,434 --> 03:55:27,294
TALIESIN: Shit. Okay.

3616
03:55:27,294 --> 03:55:28,669
SAM: Back to the tavern, then.

3617
03:55:28,669 --> 03:55:29,830
TALIESIN: Back to the tavern for now.

3618
03:55:29,830 --> 03:55:31,029
LAURA: They're going to notice--

3619
03:55:31,029 --> 03:55:32,229
MATT: Stealth check real fast, guys.

3620
03:55:32,229 --> 03:55:35,232
MARISHA: I was going to say, do you have Pass
Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?

3621
03:55:35,232 --> 03:55:36,817
LAURA: I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now.

3622
03:55:36,817 --> 03:55:38,868
MATT: If you want to quickly, yeah.

3623
03:55:38,868 --> 03:55:40,506
MARISHA: Yeah, before we move.

3624
03:55:40,506 --> 03:55:45,423
MATT: Stealth checks?

3625
03:55:45,423 --> 03:55:46,478
SAM: 19.

3626
03:55:46,478 --> 03:55:47,988
LIAM: Did we get the Pass Without a Trace?

3627
03:55:47,988 --> 03:55:48,889
LAURA: Yeah.

3628
03:55:48,889 --> 03:55:50,394
LIAM: So, plus ten, right?

3629
03:55:50,394 --> 03:55:51,146
MATT: Yeah.

3630
03:55:51,146 --> 03:55:52,043
LIAM: 34.

3631
03:55:52,043 --> 03:55:52,730
TALIESIN: 20.

3632
03:55:52,730 --> 03:55:53,197
MARISHA: 25.

3633
03:55:53,197 --> 03:55:54,005
TRAVIS: 21.

3634
03:55:54,005 --> 03:55:54,900
LAURA: 24.

3635
03:55:54,900 --> 03:55:58,930
MATT: Sure enough, both guards rush around the
corner. You guys have already leapt over the

3636
03:55:58,930 --> 03:56:02,648
fence. However, they see the fence. "The fence is
bent!" And they go rushing toward that direction.

3637
03:56:02,648 --> 03:56:06,795
You guys have already disappeared into the various
alleyways, making your way back towards the inn in

3638
03:56:06,795 --> 03:56:08,006
the center of town.

3639
03:56:08,006 --> 03:56:09,790
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of
Tracelessness.

3640
03:56:09,790 --> 03:56:11,997
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind
us.

3641
03:56:11,997 --> 03:56:16,968
MATT: Okay. They're giving chase. They're hearing
the sounds of your footsteps a little, but

3642
03:56:16,968 --> 03:56:23,381
eventually their sounds fade. You do hear in the
distance a bell start going off.

3643
03:56:23,437 --> 03:56:26,516
TALIESIN: We're going to go into the basement.

3644
03:56:26,516 --> 03:56:29,860
MATT: You start seeing people emerging from their
homes, hearing the bell. And, you would know this,

3645
03:56:29,860 --> 03:56:35,438
this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire
breaks out in the city. You see smoke beginning to

3646
03:56:35,438 --> 03:56:43,804
rise up, even through the rainstorm. The fire is
fighting the rain. But the smoke is black and

3647
03:56:43,871 --> 03:56:48,977
it's starting to fade. You gather the building
itself did not catch fire enough to burn into

3648
03:56:48,977 --> 03:56:53,699
rubble due to the rain, but you've probably left a
very visible mark on the roof.

3649
03:56:53,699 --> 03:56:55,902
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3650
03:56:55,902 --> 03:57:00,195
MATT: People begin to gather from the outside, and
you see folks running past the alley as you make

3651
03:57:00,195 --> 03:57:03,993
your way back to the tavern that you currently
have as your base of operations. You all make your

3652
03:57:03,994 --> 03:57:12,198
way in safely from the rain. Take a deep breath
and come to understand that you've definitely

3653
03:57:12,198 --> 03:57:17,873
started the motion of whatever it is you're
intending to do. We'll see how it plays out in the

3654
03:57:17,940 --> 03:57:21,070
near future. We'll call the session there for the
night.

3655
03:57:21,157 --> 03:57:23,315
TRAVIS: Shit got hairy.

3656
03:57:23,315 --> 03:57:25,291
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

3657
03:57:25,291 --> 03:57:28,499
LAURA: That was dark, you guys. Super dark.

3658
03:57:28,499 --> 03:57:29,974
SAM: I found seven gold.

3659
03:57:29,974 --> 03:57:31,914
TALIESIN: I have a sword, now.

3660
03:57:31,914 --> 03:57:36,932
TRAVIS: It's October.

3661
03:57:36,932 --> 03:57:41,089
MARISHA: Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline--

3662
03:57:41,089 --> 03:57:42,736
TALIESIN: So that's about to happen, yeah.

3663
03:57:42,736 --> 03:57:47,983
MARISHA: I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek
and Sundry website, you can find his playlist.

3664
03:57:47,983 --> 03:57:54,177
TALIESIN: Music to burn a house to. Music to violently
murder people to.

3665
03:57:54,177 --> 03:57:57,713
MARISHA: I was gonna say, music to murder to.
Go check it out, it's great.

3666
03:57:57,713 --> 03:58:01,994
TALIESIN: Music for a midnight murder. There we
are. Actually, I have some art that I would

3667
03:58:01,994 --> 03:58:03,545
love to-- can I put on the--

3668
03:58:03,545 --> 03:58:05,140
MATT: Yeah, sure.

3669
03:58:05,140 --> 03:58:06,925
MARISHA: Taliesin art.

3670
03:58:06,925 --> 03:58:11,177
TALIESIN: Yeah, I drew pictures. Just in case everybody
wants to see, this is the terrible thing

3671
03:58:11,177 --> 03:58:13,727
we keep carving into people and things.

3672
03:58:13,727 --> 03:58:15,183
MARISHA: Or burning on rooftops.

3673
03:58:15,183 --> 03:58:21,589
TALIESIN: And then this is actually the de Rolo family
crest. Just another fancy thing.

3674
03:58:21,589 --> 03:58:27,308
MATT: Very, very cool, and well done, sir.

3675
03:58:27,308 --> 03:58:33,244
TALIESIN: Thank you. I drew a picture. So that shit
happened.

3676
03:58:33,244 --> 03:58:38,155
MARISHA: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks
you're crazy anymore.

3677
03:58:38,155 --> 03:58:40,374
TALIESIN: I think I'm crazy now. It's gonna
be interesting.

3678
03:58:40,374 --> 03:58:46,242
MARISHA: You're all crazy, we've all seen it.
Now we can handle it as a family.

3679
03:58:46,242 --> 03:58:47,922
ZAC: Yeah, y'all's fucked up.

3680
03:58:47,922 --> 03:58:50,275
TALIESIN: That got way darker than I was expecting.

3681
03:58:50,275 --> 03:58:55,796
ZAC: Yeah. I'm sure that won't have any negative
repercussions whatsoever.

3682
03:58:55,796 --> 03:58:57,008
MATT: No.

3683
03:58:57,008 --> 03:58:59,221
TALIESIN: I hate you, Matt.

3684
03:58:59,221 --> 03:59:02,410
LAURA: Hey, man. Did we hit 10k?

3685
03:59:02,410 --> 03:59:03,292
ZAC: Yep.

3686
03:59:03,292 --> 03:59:05,735
(cheering)

3687
03:59:05,735 --> 03:59:11,680
ZAC: 10,060. Currently Starburns is winning.

3688
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:17,110
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Starburns! Do it!

3689
03:59:17,110 --> 03:59:21,805
ZAC: Here's what they forget: Jess and Steph are
the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess

3690
03:59:21,805 --> 03:59:30,167
and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up
being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and

3691
03:59:30,167 --> 03:59:36,767
Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to
yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.

3692
03:59:36,767 --> 03:59:40,412
TALIESIN: I got a straight razor, we could go for
this. You trust me, I mean, you know.

3693
03:59:40,412 --> 03:59:42,651
I can get in there.

3694
03:59:42,651 --> 03:59:43,987
ZAC: Moving on.

3695
03:59:43,987 --> 03:59:45,737
TALIESIN: I can Sweeney Todd that.

3696
03:59:45,737 --> 03:59:51,754
ZAC: Okay, so. Tonight, guys, we're just gonna be
reading off the names and we're gonna

3697
03:59:51,754 --> 03:59:53,682
knock through 'em pretty quick.

3698
03:59:53,682 --> 04:00:01,596
MATT: We're trying to keep time down for weeknights.
All right, guys, so we have donating tonight to

3699
04:00:01,596 --> 04:00:10,847
Extra Live, we have Connor Brown, Steven Sudeban Davis,
Ravi Persuad, Mitchell DeFow-- sorry if I ruin

3700
04:00:10,847 --> 04:00:18,517
any of these names, guys, by the way-- Tom Revely, Caleb
Popum, Michael Holloway, George Rinn,

3701
04:00:18,517 --> 04:00:35,515
PumpkinSpiceThisBitchTheFourth, Anonymous Donator,
we have Patrick Toro, the Lost Tigers, Rebecca Case,

3702
04:00:35,515 --> 04:00:48,494
Lewis Letter, Emma returns, Emma Engquist, I hope
I'm not ruining that too bad, Pernil Ilfsen-- that's

3703
04:00:48,494 --> 04:00:55,599
a cool name-- Arthur Gibbs, another wonderful anonymous
donator, Maxine Poloquin, another great anonymous

3704
04:00:55,599 --> 04:01:06,137
donator, Christian Huntlee, James Bell, John Reap, Killer
Penguin, Monica Dahl, Kayla Ernest, Tim Pearson,

3705
04:01:06,137 --> 04:01:10,863
another great anonymous donator, PumpkinSpiceThisBitch
twice more--

3706
04:01:10,863 --> 04:01:13,964
ZAC: Well, one's the original and one's the second.

3707
04:01:13,964 --> 04:01:19,174
MATT: Oh, it carried over, I see. I see. The original 
and the second. There's a third one in there, probably.

3708
04:01:19,174 --> 04:01:24,041
Guys, thank you so much. It's really incredible, each
one of you that donated to help Extra Life.

3709
04:01:24,041 --> 04:01:25,223
We really appreciate it.

3710
04:01:25,223 --> 04:01:33,191
ZAC: Since this weekend is the 24-hour Nerdist Extra
Life stream, starting next week we'll go back to 826LA

3711
04:01:33,191 --> 04:01:35,942
and get those donations rolling back in for 826--

3712
04:01:35,942 --> 04:01:43,686
MARISHA: But in the meantime, don't forget to go to
LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k.

3713
04:01:43,686 --> 04:01:51,283
ZAC: I would also like to throw out there the other--
it currently looks like it's a race between Starburns,

3714
04:01:51,283 --> 04:01:53,822
Freddie Mercury, and Fu Manchu.

3715
04:01:53,822 --> 04:01:55,850
LAURA: Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.

3716
04:01:55,850 --> 04:01:58,692
TALIESIN: Starburns' really kinda rocking it for me.

3717
04:01:58,692 --> 04:02:03,153
MARISHA: I was gonna suggest-- we had the Hunger Games
reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever?

3718
04:02:03,153 --> 04:02:05,076
The Gamemaster in the first one?

3719
04:02:05,076 --> 04:02:08,408
ZAC: There is no way Steph and Jess have the ability
to do something like that.

3720
04:02:08,408 --> 04:02:16,736
MATT: I almost wanna see the tristache. Tristache is
when you shave the handlebar, and then a smaller

3721
04:02:16,736 --> 04:02:18,132
handlebar, and then a smaller--

3722
04:02:18,132 --> 04:02:20,675
(laughter)

3723
04:02:20,675 --> 04:02:22,873
ZAC: Poll's out. The poll's out, dude.

3724
04:02:22,873 --> 04:02:25,491
SAM: Is the Hitler on the poll at all?

3725
04:02:25,491 --> 04:02:27,776
(groaning)

3726
04:02:27,776 --> 04:02:31,079
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person! That is the
worst thing I've heard yet.

3727
04:02:31,079 --> 04:02:32,746
SAM: The Charlie Chaplin.

3728
04:02:32,746 --> 04:02:41,359
ZAC: We also have a video to show you guys from a
community member about their own D&amp;D Extra

3729
04:02:41,359 --> 04:02:45,909
Life stream they're doing this weekend, so we are
going to show that to you guys here once you

3730
04:02:45,909 --> 04:02:47,328
guys sign off, so.

3731
04:02:47,328 --> 04:02:48,551
MATT: Fantastic, thank you so much.

3732
04:02:48,551 --> 04:02:51,784
ZAC: Stick around tomorrow for Jess and Steph's 
birthday, where they cut my fucking face up.

3733
04:02:51,784 --> 04:02:53,569
(cheering)

3734
04:02:53,569 --> 04:02:57,522
MATT: That's gonna be worth its own weight in gold.
Well, all right, guys, we'll be back next week

3735
04:02:57,522 --> 04:03:05,044
for our special Halloween episode of Critical Role.
We'll see how the story progresses darker and

3736
04:03:05,102 --> 04:03:12,202
darker down this hole of horror and moral conundrum.
(laughs) I'm excited. I hope you are too.

3737
04:03:12,202 --> 04:03:17,440
Once again, guys, thank you all so much. Our love to
the Team Hooman, Critter crowd out there, and

3738
04:03:17,440 --> 04:03:21,065
is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week.

3739
04:03:21,065 --> 04:03:23,337
TRAVIS: Damn straight!
