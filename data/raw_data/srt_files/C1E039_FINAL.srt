1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,883
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to
ta-te-ple-plah. It's already off to a good start,

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:06,593
huh?

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:07,701
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes.

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:08,727
MARISHA: Beautiful.

5
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:09,617
TALIESIN: Live streaming.

6
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:11,765
MATT: Welcome to this evening's episode of
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice

7
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:13,748
actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

8
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:14,886
TRAVIS: And make fun of our DM.

9
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:19,744
MATT: Exactly. Live internet, it's a wonderful
thing. This is why you don't drink before a game.

10
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:25,589
All right, so, first and foremost, thank you.
Welcome. We're jumping in here shortly from a bit

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,776
of a climatic endpoint last week, but before we
get into that, we're going to go ahead and try and

12
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:35,301
cruise through these pre-show announcements. So,
first and foremost, I want to let you guys know

13
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:41,061
that the short video series I'm doing for Geek and
Sundry, that's GM and DM Tips, launched last week

14
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:46,477
on Friday, and a few videos will be coming out
every Friday for the next couple months or so, so

15
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:50,151
every Friday go check that out on
GeekandSundry.com to see what other bit of

16
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,268
rambling I'm doing and hoping to try and help some
of you make your game a little more interesting.

17
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:58,896
So tomorrow I guess is the next one. I'm not quite
sure what topic it's on, but it should be fun. So

18
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:06,305
check that out. As a reminder, most of us are
going to be present at Wizard World Portland next

19
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:12,043
month. We'll be there Saturday and Sunday for the
con, and we'll have a panel both days. I think

20
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:15,986
Saturday is the Critical Role panel, and Sunday is
going to be more of a voiceover-related one, so

21
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:21,786
hope to see you guys there. Bring your stuff if
you want to have it signed and come get ready to

22
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:24,630
ask questions and hang out, basically.

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,280
LAURA: And par-ty!

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,116
TRAVIS: And also find us during the days in the
general hall area, we'll be around quite a bit.

25
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:37,725
MATT: Yeah, we'll be around. So, if you would like
to see us possibly come to a Wizard World near you

26
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:42,925
in the future, go ahead and send a tweet to Wizard
World's Twitter, and let them know how excited

27
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:46,422
you'd be to see us at more events in the future,
because that would make them more inclined to want

28
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:54,681
to bring us to more events! Let's see-- Also as a
reminder, me and Marisha will be at Colorado Anime

29
00:01:54,681 --> 00:02:00,600
Fest, February 12th through the 14th in Denver,
Colorado.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,999
MARISHA: Valentine's Day Weekend.

31
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:05,239
MATT: Yep, so we'll be out there, hanging with you
folks in Colorado. You should come say hello, we'd

32
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:12,702
love to see you. Also, a reminder, the Dungeon
Masters Guild, awesome new opportunity for content

33
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:16,425
creators for Dungeons and Dragons. You know,
create your own classes, your own rules, your own

34
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:19,492
feats, your own stuff. There's a great place to
put it up there, and you can set your price for

35
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:24,628
it. You can check out my most updated version of
the Blood Hunter and recently updated Gunslinger,

36
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,012
which is now version 1.1, just went up yesterday,
so if you have one of those you can update that

37
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:32,165
and get the newest set. A couple minor changes and
tweaks.

38
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,425
TRAVIS: And it's super cool.

39
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,044
TALIESIN: Anything I need to know about?

40
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:40,624
MATT: Nothing you have to worry about yet. It was
mainly the level 15 ability piercing shot and a

41
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:43,071
couple of clarifications that I know. You'll be
fine.

42
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,882
MARISHA: It's for you to find out, all right.

43
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,665
TALIESIN: That's his subtle way of saying I'm not
going to make level 15.

44
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:56,469
MATT: Could be. Ouch. We shall see. All right,
Wyrmwood Gaming, awesome friend of the show. They

45
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:02,320
still have their 'critrole' discount code, you get
free shipping if you go ahead and order something

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,629
from their site, really awesome-

47
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,092
LIAM: 'critrole'. The code is 'critrole'.

48
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:08,828
MATT: Just one delightful word.

49
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:14,833
Pretty wood. That's a cool arrangement, I
like that.

50
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:19,279
MARISHA: Thanks. I designed it like this.

51
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,433
TALIESIN: You're so creative.

52
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:26,741
MATT: Oh, and Liam, if you want to check your
Twitter, there's a cool little present I think

53
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:33,556
waiting for you now from one of our fan artists.
You know her as Mikandii, is her Twitter. She has

54
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:34,795
a cool little thing for you.

55
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,586
LIAM: Yes I will, I am very excited

56
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,329
LAURA: Is it you and Gilmore making out?

57
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,349
LIAM: That's emblazoned on the inside of my mind.
Wow!

58
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,807
LAURA: What is it? What is it?

59
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,164
LIAM: Wow. Oh, nothing.

60
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:47,319
LAURA: No, I want to see it!

61
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,589
LAURA: Wow! That's amazing!

62
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:51,416
MATT: I haven't seen it yet, so I'm excited.

63
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,231
LIAM: Wow. It's beautiful. Thank you.

64
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:58,486
LAURA: Oh my god, he looks so dreamy.

65
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:02,146
MATT: So, go to @VoiceofOBrien to see what
apparently he is looking at, that I have no idea

66
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:04,120
what it is. Hopefully it's not just a giant dick.

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,325
LIAM: That's included.

68
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:12,302
MARISHA: It's subversive. It's what you see in the
art.

69
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,403
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's your interpretation.

70
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:23,882
MATT: Now I'm excited for that.

71
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:30,295
MARISHA: Oh, I want to see the two side-by-side.
Yes, there's a Kickstarter up right now called

72
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:36,873
Lost Hope: the Series, that I'm a part of. It's
like Battlestar Galactica meets Archer and, yeah.

73
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:41,186
I voice a character named Simmons in there. It's
fun. Go check it out.

74
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,508
LIAM: That's a good pitch.

75
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:48,315
MATT: There you go. And the Mythica 4 Kickstarter
is up right now, as well. They're already

76
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:52,343
rocketing toward their goal, which is awesome, and
you get to see me as an evil necromancer casting

77
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:57,416
magic spells at good people. And actually at Kevin
Sorbo, second film in a row I get to cast magic at

78
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:02,230
him, pretty excited about that. So check that out.
Did you have something you wanted to announce?

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,454
TRAVIS: Yeah. Matt and I are both in Warner Bros.
Home Entertainment's Batman: Bad Blood! Which is

80
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:12,574
out right now on Digital Download on iTunes. It's
solid rock. Can't move.

81
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:13,830
LAURA: Solid rock.

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,254
TRAVIS: Yeah. I play the Heretic. Matt plays a
million other people. It's really cool, check it

83
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:18,792
out. We fight Batman.

84
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,039
MATT: Yeah! I get electrocuted.

85
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,173
TRAVIS: I sing Taylor Swift songs and all that.

86
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:35,690
MATT: I jump around and punch things, it's fun.
Oh, and last but not least announcement, next

87
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:45,731
Monday on Ivan's wonderful RPG show No Survivors,
me, Laura, Felicia, Wil, a bunch of people, I

88
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:49,501
haven't looked at the full list yet, are all going to
be guesting on that as players for a round of one

89
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,478
of my favorite RPGs, Paranoia.

90
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,697
LAURA: Which I haven't ever played. But Ivan was telling
me about it and it sounds like so much fun.

91
00:05:56,697 --> 00:06:01,431
MATT: Yeah, it's one of my favorite RPG systems
ever. So next Monday, go check out No

92
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:06,440
Survivors. We're all going to be playing Paranoia
and making ridiculous choices and probably dying

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,739
in horrible, wonderful ways, so, we'll be there
for that. Hi, Sam. Glad you could join us, buddy.

94
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,141
SAM: (whispering) Thanks.

95
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:16,421
MATT: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,961
LIAM: Hi, Sam.

97
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:25,063
MARISHA: I like this sweater, is this new?

98
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,604
SAM: Thanks. Yeah.

99
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:27,902
LAURA: It's so hot in here, though.

100
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:32,830
SAM: Oh no, I'll take it off.

101
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,414
TRAVIS: You and me, we got problems now.

102
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:41,332
(laughter)

103
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:45,803
MARISHA: Oh god!

104
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:50,619
TRAVIS: I'd like to Great Weapon Master right now.
Where's Scanlan on the map?

105
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,468
MATT: He's right over here. You can work towards
over there shortly.

106
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:58,506
LIAM: All this time you've been trying to kick my
teeth in and your real enemy is right over here.

107
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,147
TRAVIS: True colors, (singing) shining through!

108
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:04,282
(laughter)

109
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:13,178
MATT: All right! Good, it's getting you in
character, perfect. So now we've finished all the

110
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,187
announcements I believe, if anyone has anything
else we're going to go ahead and get into

111
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:22,438
tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, where we left
off, our intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, having

112
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:28,666
returned the traitor Riskel Daxio to Sovereign
Uriel in the center of the town of Emon, Grog

113
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:34,616
beheading him as part of his punishment for being
such a traitorous worshiper of the evil entity

114
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:44,379
known as Vecna. Upon going out for a pub crawl,
came across Gilmore in a secret speakeasy, managed

115
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:53,029
to enjoy a Heroes' Feast at his expense, whereas
Vex and Vax both, all of you, got pretty-- Keyleth

116
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,248
got very-- drunk.

117
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,987
LAURA: I didn't get drunk at all.

118
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:57,167
MATT: That's right, you didn't drink.

119
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,440
MARISHA: I got pretty wasted.

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,444
MATT: Gilmore had a very intense conversation with
Vax over there to ensure where they stood, and

121
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:12,135
Keyleth vomited multiple times. But after which
the party found their way back to the Keep, where

122
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:19,206
Dr. Dranzel and his Spectacular Traveling Troupe
were drinking and expecting you to be there, in

123
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,500
which they could converse and try and convince you
of a little caper they've been trying to get their

124
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,844
head around for a while, and you seem to have the
entry to this possible windfall of money. Scanlan,

125
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:34,599
after courting this young, pixie-haired gnome--

126
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,301
SAM: I sort of knew in the back of my head, right?
No, I was courting her. No, it's true.

127
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,559
(laughter)

128
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,278
MATT: Was instead confronted in his bedroom by
Kaylie, who revealed herself to be Scanlan's

129
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:56,058
long-unknown daughter from many years ago, who had
trained very hard as a bard at the College of the

130
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:03,203
White Duke, in Westruun, and honed her skills with
a blade with the intent of finding you one day and

131
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:09,522
disgracing you. Thanks to Scanlan's sudden
realization, change of heart, and attempt to

132
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:20,128
connect with his lost blood, broke a bit of that
cold honed exterior, and managed to prevent a very

133
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:28,424
dangerous and possibly deadly encounter. She left
frustrated and confused, and hasn't been seen

134
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:35,359
since. The rest of you, gathering the next
morning, discussed this endeavor with Dr. Dranzel

135
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:42,429
and how they had found a home that had been long
abandoned after being purchased by a collector. A

136
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:46,731
home that you guys had ransacked a little over a
year before after finding a portal within that

137
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:51,598
led to a dragon's hoard, as the previous person
who lived there, General Krieg, was actually a

138
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,377
dragon who had infiltrated the Council.

139
00:09:54,377 --> 00:10:01,576
LAURA: A really hot dragon. I remember thinking he
was really cute. I had a thing for General Krieg.

140
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:03,257
I was really sad when it turned out he was--

141
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:04,566
MATT: I'm sorry it worked out that way.

142
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:13,324
MATT: Yeah, that was Grog's famous rage looting.
General Krieg, Bonescythe-- Brimscythe, sorry.

143
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:18,350
They're close. Brimscythe the Dragon was
slaughtered in this endeavor, however it's been

144
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,754
over a year since. You guys returned to this house,
scoured it, found your way through the still

145
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:29,971
existing secret passage that led you to the
now partially collapsed cavern, which once housed

146
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:36,420
Brimscythe and his hoard. You found that the
tunnel itself, freezing cold, the rubble of the

147
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,516
partially collapsed cavern had been ravaged by
some sort of large clawed entity that Vex had

148
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:47,448
identified as another equally dangerous dragon
that seems to have rummaged through and found the

149
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:55,041
corpse of Brimscythe. You also found that a number
of gold coins, a bit of his hoard that had been

150
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,344
buried in this, were now exposed by these strange,
smooth tunnels that were carved into the rock.

151
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:05,950
Upon you, Scanlan, and Trinket inquiring there,
the rest of the party scattered. Pike and Keyleth

152
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,884
went to find what seemed to be the owner of the
house, now frozen in fright in a far alcove. And

153
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:17,138
the three, the rest of your group, traveling
towards the mouth of the cavern itself, before the

154
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:23,887
ground begins to rumble. Suddenly, exploding from
the rock and shale of the bottom of the cavern

155
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:32,764
floor, you guys managed to see before you, piercing
forth from the ground itself, a very, very large,

156
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:36,585
segmented, armored, worm-like entity.

157
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:37,767
SAM: Armored?

158
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,503
MATT: The actual hide itself is like very, very
thick.

159
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,085
LAURA: Super thick? Ugh!

160
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,356
SAM: Like with armor?

161
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:47,172
MATT: Not with armor, just this natural sense.

162
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,600
LAURA: When we kill it, we can make armor out of
him.

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,707
LIAM: And it was pale and icy, too, I think you
were describing?

164
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:57,877
MATT: It was darkish purple in its color and tint,
like dark blacks, purple, with rows and rows of

165
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:03,997
teeth coming out of its eyeless face. As it bursts
out of the surface, I need you all to roll

166
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:04,935
initiative.

167
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,137
LAURA: No!

168
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:07,823
SAM: Oh my god, right away, right away. We're just
in it. Just like that.

169
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:09,193
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah!

170
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:20,860
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20?

171
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,923
TRAVIS: 20, to kill Scanlan.

172
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,792
(laughter)

173
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,967
MATT: 20 to 15?

174
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,259
MARISHA: 19.

175
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,568
SAM: That's it?

176
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:31,689
LIAM: 15.

177
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:37,243
MATT: 15 to ten?

178
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,463
TALIESIN: Ten.

179
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,076
SAM: 11.

180
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:50,154
MATT: All right, then comes ten to five?

181
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,588
LAURA: Nine.

182
00:12:51,588 --> 00:13:00,263
MATT: And Pike, while, as she's not here, rolled
the lowest. Ashley, unfortunately, due to

183
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:03,902
scheduling, could not be here this evening. So
far, we're hoping she might show up at some point

184
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:09,512
tonight, we'll find out. But, in the meantime, I'm
going to be running Pike on my end. So, starting

185
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:15,411
the encounter, as you see this giant worm creature
through the tunnel, the three of you now walking

186
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:19,738
the other direction, you, feeling the rumble, 
turn around, holding forth your greatsword

187
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:25,591
unsheathed, you can feel the power pulsing with
each beat of your blood through your body, as a

188
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:30,841
little voice in the back of your head, stemming
from your weapon, goes, "Kill." You're up, Grog.

189
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:35,962
TRAVIS: Well, I hope you're hungry. But you have
to wait one second, we're a bit far away. Can I

190
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,238
travel as far as I can towards?

191
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,799
MATT: Speed of 50, I believe?

192
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,934
TRAVIS: 50.

193
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:46,750
LAURA: Oh, I said I hid at the end of the episode.
I said I hid.

194
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,534
MATT: Right, roll stealth.

195
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:52,633
TRAVIS: Do I have a line of sight with him, or is
the edge of that outcropping blocking it?

196
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:58,890
MATT: He would have half cover if you were to try
and like, throw your weapon at him. It'd be a plus

197
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,178
five to his armor class.

198
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,744
MARISHA: Pike and I are hiding, too.

199
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,872
MATT: Okay, stealth check for both of you.

200
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:09,545
TRAVIS: Could I back up three squares, so that I
could move to my left so I could get a straight

201
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:10,722
look at him?

202
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,052
MATT: There, you mean?

203
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,463
TRAVIS: Can I go one more?

204
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,623
MATT: That's the extent of your movement right
there, unfortunately. Unless you want to go at

205
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,220
this angle, there. There you go.

206
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,850
TRAVIS: Can I use the Javelin of Lightning?

207
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,531
SAM: What the fuck is that? That's a thing you
made up.

208
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:33,665
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I've got it. I utter the magic
word "Penelope" and I throw it and each creature

209
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,987
in the line, excluding me and the target, must
make a DC 13 dexterity saving throw.

210
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,098
MATT: Okay, there are no creatures in the line,
just the target.

211
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:41,342
TRAVIS: Just the target then.

212
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:42,571
LIAM: Did you get that in Yug'Voril?

213
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,757
TRAVIS: Huh?

214
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,037
LIAM: Yug'Voril. Is it from Yug'Voril?

215
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,547
TRAVIS: I don't remember, it's just in the bag.

216
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:50,447
LIAM: In Yug'Voril, at the bottom of that pit,
when he headbutted the giant.

217
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,058
MATT: Yup, that was in the rubble.

218
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,123
LIAM: Yeah! Ding!

219
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,305
MATT: Good memory!

220
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:57,284
TRAVIS: Can I try and throw it?

221
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,835
MATT: You may, go for it.

222
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:03,231
TRAVIS: 18.

223
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:10,210
MATT: 18 total? 18 just hits. So, go ahead and
roll damage for the javelin. As you rear back,

224
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:17,615
aim it with your eyes, and the frustration is
palpable from Craven Edge as you put it aside to

225
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:22,998
throw the javelin instead as it arcs into a bolt
of energy that streaks forth, slams into the hide

226
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,316
of the giant purple worm. Go ahead and roll
damage.

227
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:30,186
TRAVIS: 19.

228
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:38,898
MATT: 19. All righty. Great. It rears in place,
shakes itself for a second. It has no eyes, so

229
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:43,602
it's not looking in any different direction, it
just seems to be flailing in its current

230
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:44,685
location.

231
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:45,963
TRAVIS: Can I go into a rage?

232
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:47,352
MATT: Yes you may.

233
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:48,840
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

234
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,509
MATT: All right. (laughs)

235
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,801
LAURA: Are you rolling your special dice?

236
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:56,938
MATT: As you bite your lower lip, you feel and
taste the blood begin to enter your mouth, and at

237
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:01,317
that point the heat in the back of your shoulders
and neck begins to swell up. Grog's into a rage.

238
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:04,017
That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

239
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:08,538
MARISHA: Can I do, like, a nature check on this
thing to see if I can discern any type of

240
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,372
information on it?

241
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,816
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make an intelligence
check.

242
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:21,357
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence? That's not
good. I think that is a five? Six! Six!

243
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:31,745
MATT: Six. You have no recollection of this type
of an entity in your travels. It's definitely not

244
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:36,412
natural, it's not of nature, and you've seen
various types of eyeless worm-type creatures, but

245
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,821
nowhere near on this scale. So, yeah. You have no
idea beyond that.

246
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:51,719
MARISHA: I'm just going to whisper to Pike, and be
like: It doesn't have any eyes! I feel like we

247
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,589
shouldn't move!

248
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:59,529
MATT: She goes, "Okay!" And she gets as still as
she possibly can. "It's good! Moving's not my forte."

249
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:04,101
MARISHA: Okay! I, like, hold her shoulder pads so
she doesn't clink any.

250
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,066
MATT: "Okay!"

251
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,831
MARISHA: Okay! I'm going to stay right here!

252
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:14,782
MATT: All right. So that ends your turn. Vax,
you're up. Unless you want to do something else on

253
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:16,605
your turn, is that it?

254
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:20,225
MARISHA: I'm just, I'm just going to, I don't want
to move. I'm just going to wait.

255
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,968
SAM: (mocking) I don't want to, I don't want to
move!

256
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:23,312
MARISHA: I don't want to move!

257
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:33,127
LIAM: Click the Boots of Haste, and I want to go
stealth, and scoot to that column past Grog, but

258
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:37,152
closer to the worm. Not that one, the next one.
Yeah. I think I can make it there.

259
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:42,077
MATT: All right. You can get there.

260
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,705
LIAM: Do I need to roll stealth?

261
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,707
MATT: You can roll stealth, yeah.

262
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:51,393
LIAM: I want to throw a dagger at it. Yeah. That
is 28.

263
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:58,366
MATT: All right. That definitely hits. However, it
is not sneak attack damage. You are hiding

264
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:05,400
definitely behind the pillar, but your footsteps.
And you get the essence as soon as you see the

265
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,285
creature, its head follows you across the room,
you get the sense immediately that it is not a

266
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:13,087
sight-based creature, it is definitely a
movement-based creature, and its head just follows

267
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,602
you as you move.

268
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:18,988
LIAM: I'll defer, but let me ask, going stealth
and rolling a 28 on stealth, the footsteps were

269
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:20,919
still enough to alert it to where I was?

270
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,044
MATT: Is it a natural 20?

271
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:26,598
LIAM: I didn't attack yet. No, it was a combined
28, just to go stealth.

272
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:32,734
MATT: A combined 28. Right, even so, not quite
light enough. Not with the knowledge that it was

273
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,511
an issue with this entity, and due to the
proximity of it, and it being a very sensitive

274
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,119
creature to the rock's movement, it still picks
you up.

275
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,213
LIAM: And I should have one attack. I should have
an attack, right? Because I did the boots, I ran

276
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:45,187
over here--

277
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:47,421
MATT: Yep, so you have an attack.

278
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:48,343
LIAM: Two.

279
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,969
MATT: Well, two attacks, you have offhand, so
yeah.

280
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:54,089
LIAM: Two, yeah. Two, because it was double the
speed because of the boots. All right. First one

281
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:05,374
is shit. That is 14. And the second one is-- I'm
going to do Luck on that. The second one is 20.

282
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:08,306
MATT: The second one hits. The first one
unfortunately just bounces off of its hide.

283
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:14,253
LIAM: That's not a lot. But it is seven points of
damage.

284
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,531
MATT: Seven points of damage, got it.

285
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,934
LIAM: First blood. First blood, everyone.

286
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:22,169
SAM: It's looking pretty beat up.

287
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:33,325
MATT: All right. At this point in time, the dagger
embeds itself in. You see the hilt sinks into the

288
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:38,803
hide and then vanishes in a puff of smoke as it
returns to your belt, however you can see a little

289
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,170
bit of black liquid pouring forth from it, and its
head has been trained on you since you moved across the

290
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,921
room. The worm now disappears beneath the ground.

291
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,396
TALIESIN: Not cool.

292
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:58,719
MATT: And you feel the ground beneath you begin to
shake, as it bursts out of the ground. That's a 20

293
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,868
to hit.

294
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:02,205
LIAM: 20? Can I use Evasion or no?

295
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:09,287
MATT: To reduce the damage in half if you want.
Huh? What's your AC?

296
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,057
LIAM: Oh, with the boots on, 18.

297
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,333
MATT: It rolled a 20.

298
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,401
LIAM: Yeah, I know. So tell me what happens.

299
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:21,566
MATT: So, as you look around you all of a sudden
the jaws start coming up out of the ground behind

300
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:32,920
you, the teeth biting into your body as you try
and wrest yourself away from its grip. You take 20

301
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,381
points of piercing damage.

302
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:39,192
LIAM: Oh, well, Uncanny Dodge. Right? Evasion is
for spell effects--

303
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:42,166
MATT: Right, Evasion does not help you in this
circumstance, Uncanny Dodge allows you to reduce

304
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:47,154
the damage by half. So yes, you can do that. So
you take ten damage instead. I need you to make a

305
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:48,813
dexterity saving throw.

306
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:56,630
LIAM: That's okay. All right, so. Okay. Natural
20!

307
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:04,499
MATT: As the jaws attempt to clamp around you, you
manage to just pull yourself away, tearing your

308
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:09,003
knees across the teeth, but rolling in the
opposite direction, right in the place where you

309
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:15,928
were as it bursts out of the ground just beside
you and rights itself around in that direction. As

310
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:21,021
its full body emerges now, you can see its tail
flop out of the tunnel it just made with this

311
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:32,500
giant hooked stinger on the end as it whips off in
your direction. That is going to be a 15 to hit.

312
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,785
TRAVIS: That'll miss.

313
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:38,322
MATT: That misses you. As the stinger swings
towards you, you manage to just duck out of the

314
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:43,164
way, your eyes trained on it in an absolute red
fury, and it just whiffs past your face.

315
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,570
SAM: Could've been bad, could've been bad.

316
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,732
MATT: That ends its turn. Scanlan, you're up.

317
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:49,764
SAM: Who's in front of me?

318
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:53,073
MATT: Right now you're next to Trinket and Vex is
behind you.

319
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:54,406
LAURA: (laughing) Don't be a dick!

320
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:59,086
SAM: I'm not going to be a dick. I brush past
Trinket so I can see the worm.

321
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,780
MATT: Okay, about there, you can see it from that
perspective.

322
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:09,270
SAM: Okay I hold up my cone, my Hand Cone of
Clarity, and I will cast Eyebite. Singing to it

323
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:20,445
(singing) Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Making
you very sick. Ooh, Scanlan's eyes are biting you.

324
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:29,466
Scanlan's eyes! All right, so the Eyebite refers
to my eyes. He doesn't need eyes. He doesn't need

325
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:34,833
to be able to see me, I have to be able to see
him, right? It works. Okay, so I'm going to do

326
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:35,842
Sicken.

327
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:42,849
MATT: To sicken it? All right. All right, it
rolls, this is a wisdom saving throw? It rolls an

328
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:54,239
eight. So yeah, it does not succeed on that.
Eyebite takes hold. Get this little marker on

329
00:22:54,239 --> 00:23:00,299
there, on its neck, like a little-- There we go.
So as your spell completes on it, you can see its

330
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:06,336
form contracts for a second and its head hangs a
little less strong as it did previously. It

331
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:10,921
almost goes slack for a moment from the impact of
the spell affecting its physical form. All right,

332
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:17,793
so it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks, for as long as it lasts. All right, so

333
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:19,851
that's your movement, that's your action, any
bonus actions?

334
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:25,322
SAM: I will inspire Vex. With a limerick.

335
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,403
LAURA: I can't wait.

336
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:34,362
SAM: I once knew a bear named Trinket, and would
often tell you he stink-et, but you were appalled,

337
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:37,181
so you kicked me in the balls, and now I don't say
it, I just think it.

338
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,077
(laughter)

339
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,760
LAURA: That was wonderful!

340
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,425
MATT: A d10 inspiration die to you, Vex.

341
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,446
LAURA: Yay!

342
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:46,983
LIAM: Plus or minus?

343
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:49,203
MATT: (laughs) We'll see.

344
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:53,908
MARISHA: Am I able to take a bonus action to like
shout something out over comms?

345
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:57,241
MATT: I'll allow it, since you held your turn this
turn anyways, yeah.

346
00:23:57,241 --> 00:24:05,176
MARISHA: Yeah? Everyone should try and get a
little bit so I can see you. And I can make us all fly.

347
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,398
LAURA: (shouting) What? You can make us fly?

348
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:12,622
MARISHA: I learned it today. But you have to be
within 30 feet of me.

349
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:16,932
LAURA: Oh, really, but I'm so far away from you.

350
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:19,417
MARISHA: You know, imagine I said it more
succinctly than this.

351
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,254
MATT: (laughs) That's as much as you can get out.
Percy, you're up.

352
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:29,359
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to head in the
direction of the message I just received. So I'm

353
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,851
going to crawl around the bottom there.

354
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:33,861
LAURA: Ugh, I'm not going to be able to get to
her.

355
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:34,884
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

356
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:37,706
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get, that's fine.
I'm going to take a couple shots, with the big

357
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:43,578
gun. I'm going to Bad News this. So, let's take a
shot at that guy. Yeah, that's reasonable range.

358
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:51,965
Yeah, okay. Not too close. That's not bad, 21.

359
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,642
MATT: 21 hits.

360
00:24:53,642 --> 00:25:02,407
TALIESIN: 28 points of damage.

361
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:04,035
MATT: Okay.

362
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:10,310
TALIESIN: Quick reload, going to get one more shot
off and I'm going to take this one with the

363
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,462
sharpshooter effect just to see how things go.

364
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:16,049
MATT: Sure. The sharpshooter effect, you mean the
deadeye?

365
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,560
TALIESIN: Yep. Yeah, the deadeye. The negative
five to hit.

366
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,124
MATT: Oh, got you, got you, all right.

367
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:24,615
TALIESIN: 14.

368
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:28,277
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you load
the second round, you pull Bad News in front of

369
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:34,098
you and you go to fire, the ground actually shakes
beneath you. There's a quaking. Not sure if it's

370
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:38,219
from the creature or just the atmosphere around
you, but as you do the gun just misfires and,

371
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:42,082
well, it actually doesn't misfire, but it fires
off into one of the side elements of the cave and

372
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,799
you hear it ricochet off the rock.

373
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,270
TALIESIN: That's what I got.

374
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,492
MATT: All right, that's 28 damage, 28 damage is
not bad.

375
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:51,382
All right, Vex, you're up.

376
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:59,251
LAURA: Okay. Will you be able to move forward?

377
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,268
MARISHA: Yeah.

378
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:05,983
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to send Trinket up to that
little alcove. Keep running, no, a little

379
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,049
further-- a little further.

380
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,757
MATT: That's-- what's Trinket's movement? Is it 40?
So he can go there.

381
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,398
LAURA: That's as close as he can get to you.

382
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,575
MATT: Six, actually seven, eight. So that'd be the
full movement.

383
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,417
LAURA: Okay. Get him tucked into that little
side.

384
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:24,883
MATT: Trinket is now stepping onto a bit of slick
of ice and is like (unbalanced bear noises) but

385
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,497
seems to be okay at the moment.

386
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:35,319
LAURA: Okay. And then I move forward so I can see
him. Right there. All right. And I'm going to

387
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:46,166
Hunter's Mark him! And then I'm going to shoot my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel at him. So that, I'm

388
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:50,544
going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three
arrows and they all turn into storm arrows. So I

389
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:52,491
roll an attack for each one of those for my first
attack.

390
00:26:52,491 --> 00:27:00,565
MATT: Correct. Yep. Yep. As you release the arrow
from the actual tension of the bow, as soon as it

391
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:06,225
leaves your fingers it almost burns the tips as it
races into this arrow of pure energy. As it

392
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:12,115
divides in the middle of the air, you can see each
arrow sparking off bits of electrical power on its--

393
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:14,638
LAURA: Okay, so the first one is a 26.

394
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:15,665
MATT: Hits.

395
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:17,662
LAURA: Should I roll damage for that one?

396
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:19,405
MATT: Roll to see how many hit.

397
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,880
LAURA: The second one is a 29.

398
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,012
MATT: Hits.

399
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:26,065
LAURA: The third one is a 20.

400
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:27,735
MATT: 20 hits. Yeah, all three hit.

401
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:35,694
LIAM: This is all happening in less than six
seconds.

402
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:41,764
LAURA: 17-- 20. 23 for the first arrow.

403
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,624
MATT: All righty.

404
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:55,770
LAURA: Nine, ten, 11, 13. 17 for the second one.
And then 14, 15, 16...

405
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,638
SAM: I feel bad for this thing.

406
00:27:57,638 --> 00:28:05,919
LAURA: 22. 20, what is that? 27 for the third.

407
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,938
MATT: Oof, all right. As each arrow slams into its
side, you can see portions of its large

408
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:18,830
chitinous, almost like armored shell crack and
break open. And you can see now these streams of

409
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,932
black worm blood are spilling down its side. And it
starts shaking in place now in pain.

410
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:27,561
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing
Bowstring for my second attack.

411
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:29,033
MATT: All right.

412
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,019
SAM: Second attack?

413
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:31,329
LAURA: Yeah, that was just one.

414
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,185
MATT: Yeah, she gets that once a day.

415
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,825
LAURA: 25.

416
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,162
MATT: 25 hits.

417
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:40,307
TRAVIS: You have more dice than that dice store.

418
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:56,686
LAURA: I know, it's ridiculous. 16-- 16-- 19, and
then an additional d10. So 19 of fire damage. So

419
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:58,291
25 for the third.

420
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,699
MATT: 25. Oof. That is a nasty round. Well done.

421
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,750
LAURA: For the fourth arrow.

422
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,387
MATT: As this fourth arrow
slams into its side there's a burst of fire from

423
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:10,841
the impact and you can see it now. It's starting
to shriek this horrible high-pitched multi-toned

424
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,638
scream. All right, that ends your turn.

425
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:16,693
LAURA: And I rolled a 15 for stealth, not that it
probably matters anymore.

426
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:18,934
MATT: Nah, no, it doesn't really. All right.

427
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:21,286
LAURA: And then I stay very, very still.

428
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:26,655
MATT: Cool, so does Pike. Pike's going to follow
in Keyleth's order and spend the round just

429
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:30,597
keeping in place, very quietly. All right, top of
the round again. Grog, you're up.

430
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:34,260
TRAVIS: Oh, are we flying?

431
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,660
ALL: No.

432
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,219
TRAVIS: Fuck it! I take Craven Edge out. I hope
you're hungry. And I would like to go into a

433
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,605
frenzied rage.

434
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:44,895
MATT: All right.

435
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:49,241
TRAVIS: And I would like to attack, the first two
times, at the big purple dick that just came out

436
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:50,306
of the ground.

437
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,337
MATT: All right.

438
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:53,299
MARISHA: Hey, move down a bit so you're not in my
way.

439
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,470
TRAVIS: Which way?

440
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,351
MATT: Grog's just charging in.

441
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,491
TRAVIS: That's a 23?

442
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,493
MATT: 23 hits.

443
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,190
TRAVIS: 20?

444
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,340
MATT: 20 hits.

445
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,358
TRAVIS: Wow. 26?

446
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:09,998
MATT: All three hit. These are non-Great Weapon
Master, right?

447
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:13,430
TRAVIS: The third one I wanted it to be, should I
reroll since I didn't specify?

448
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,424
MATT: Reroll because you didn't say it, yeah.

449
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:16,787
TRAVIS: 17.

450
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:20,005
MATT: That misses, unfortunately. But the first
two do hit. Yeah, you got to mention that before

451
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,145
you make the attack.

452
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:25,651
TRAVIS: I do, I do. You're right. 2d6. What do
sixes look like? They're squares.

453
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:26,577
LAURA: They're squares.

454
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,105
(laughter)

455
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,586
SAM: Cubes, really.

456
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:32,636
TRAVIS: Jeez, three, eight, 16 for the first one.

457
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:33,907
MATT: All righty.

458
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:37,330
TRAVIS: And 16 for the second one.

459
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,739
MATT: All righty. What's the DC on the sword
effect, again? Is it 12?

460
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,789
TRAVIS: Oh! Yep.

461
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:53,401
MATT: All right. So it succeeds its first saving
throw and it succeeds its second saving throw. But

462
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:57,687
you do see with each strike the intent of the
sword to draw some of the strength and life force

463
00:30:57,687 --> 00:31:03,388
from the target. Not really making any effect,
unfortunately. All right! Ending your turn, Grog,

464
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:07,517
that vibration you feel in the ground, now? It's
curious, because the worm itself is out of the

465
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:14,827
ground, now. What caused you to lose your shot?
You feel it grow stronger and stronger, before

466
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:24,890
suddenly, nearby, a secondary, different-looking,
but similar in size, worm comes bursting out of

467
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,125
the base of the cavern.

468
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,554
LAURA: Matthew Mercer! You're trying to kill us.

469
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:37,931
MATT: You can see now, as this bursts out, it's
similar in size, but different. This one has a

470
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:44,584
thicker body, it's a purple and white type
exterior, and you can see frozen mist is just

471
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,495
emanating from the outside of its open jaw.

472
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:48,446
LAURA: No, this is the one that pukes ice.

473
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,249
MARISHA: (laughs) Pukes ice?

474
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,095
LAURA: This is what made the dude frozen!

475
00:31:52,095 --> 00:32:06,787
MATT: As this one rears back, opens its jaw, and a
burst of cold air and ice shards comes spraying

476
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:08,239
out of its mouth--

477
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:11,629
LAURA: Look at this cone you have.

478
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,768
MATT: Heading towards these-- actually, it would get
the other worm too.

479
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,210
LAURA: Yes! Yes! Freeze the other worm!

480
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,833
MATT: I need a constitution saving throw from Grog
and Vax.

481
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,089
LIAM: I want to do an Evasion, that's an area
effect!

482
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,991
MATT: Yeah.

483
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:27,806
LIAM: Yeah?

484
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,167
MATT: Make your constitution saving throw.

485
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,097
LIAM: All right. (laughs) Do I do the dex save
first, or--?

486
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,070
MATT: It's not a dex save. Constitution save.

487
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,293
LIAM: Oh, it's not an area effect? All right.
Whatever you say. Natural 20.

488
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,705
TRAVIS: 21.

489
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:41,840
MATT: 21. All right. Good.

490
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,629
TRAVIS: Saving throw, right? Constitution?

491
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:49,743
MATT: Constitution saving throw. So, read your
ability real fast, does it affect only dex saves?

492
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:55,904
LIAM: Evasion on dex save-- I've written an
abbreviated version of this. It's area of effect,

493
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,239
if it's like Fireball or anything that's in an
area.

494
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,629
MATT: Right, but I think it may specify whether or
not--

495
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:02,202
LIAM: Oh, but you're god, what do you want me to
do?

496
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:03,941
MATT: I'm just looking it up right now, give me a
second.

497
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,864
TRAVIS: Ooh! I have Danger Sense. I have advantage
on dexterity saving throws.

498
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:08,927
MATT: This is not dexterity. This is
constitution.

499
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:13,567
SAM: Oh, but you know what? I have really good
dexterity.

500
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:19,621
MATT: Yep, dexterity saving throw. So this does
not affect this attack. Sorry. All right, so you

501
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:22,007
both take half damage, as does the creature.

502
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:31,126
TALIESIN: That's a lot of rolling.

503
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:33,865
SAM: He's only rolling a d2. He's rolling a d2.

504
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:38,996
MATT: All right! That's 40 points of damage,
halved, that's 20 points of cold damage to each of

505
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:41,073
you, and the purple worm.

506
00:33:41,073 --> 00:33:42,303
LIAM: Wait, 40 or 20?

507
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:43,710
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

508
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,631
LAURA: It does 40 points?!

509
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:50,199
LIAM: Can I do Uncanny-- this is a new round, can
I do Uncanny or not, yet?

510
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,966
MATT: It has not gotten back to your turn, so no.

511
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,110
LAURA: We're going to die!

512
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,661
TRAVIS: No, we're good! Shut up! We're fine!

513
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,396
MATT: All right. Now! It's Keyleth's turn.

514
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:06,709
MARISHA: Here's what I want to try and do. I want
to try and hope to god I can get everyone in here.

515
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,419
LIAM: Shake that hangover off, Kiki.

516
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:10,402
MARISHA: I wanted to--
oh wait, I'm trying to point the fucking-- point

517
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:11,931
the laser at the screen.

518
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,688
MATT: Yeah, don't point at the screen. Point it at
the actual map. That's okay.

519
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:20,916
MARISHA: I want to try and go-- five, ten, 15--
can I go through Grog? Through there?

520
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,162
MATT: You can try to, yeah.

521
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,985
LAURA: You're going to go past the worm, though!

522
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:31,185
MARISHA: Can I go there? Wait, wait, back closer
to the-- I want to be able to try and-- can I see

523
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,808
Scanlan and stuff, over there?

524
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:36,600
MATT: You can see Scanlan, you can see pretty much
everybody but Trinket from this perspective, and

525
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,713
you can't see Pike.

526
00:34:37,713 --> 00:34:38,749
LAURA: Shit.

527
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:40,475
MARISHA: All right.

528
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:42,311
LAURA: Thought I was helping.

529
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:49,622
MARISHA: Everyone, I guess, who's within 30 range
of me, I'm going to do a wind blast, and we all

530
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:52,307
turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves.

531
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,639
MATT: Which one is this?

532
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:04,296
MARISHA: Wind Walk. Poofy Cloud. So as I run past
Grog, I brush his shoulder, and he turns into a

533
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:10,210
mist form, and I turn into a mist form, and then I
blast it out, and everyone's mist form!

534
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:17,140
MATT: All right, cool. So while in mist form, you
guys have a flying speed of 300 feet, you have

535
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,287
resistance to non-magical weapons, you can only
dash.

536
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,404
MARISHA: Oh, you can't attack?

537
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:29,986
MATT: No. You've got to read your spell. You can
take a minute to revert your form, but as of right

538
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:34,406
now, all of you guys currently, everyone within 30
feet.

539
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,780
SAM: I'm not within 30 feet.

540
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:44,055
MATT: You can see within range, so you can't see
Pike. You've got to read the spell. Does not

541
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:49,907
affect Trinket because you can't see Trinket.
Doesn't affect you guys. Scanlan is just out of

542
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:58,387
range. So Vex and Scanlan, you're unaffected. You
watch half of the party turn into these gaseous

543
00:35:58,387 --> 00:35:59,383
forms.

544
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:02,225
SAM: Oh my god, the worms have turned us all into
clouds!

545
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:04,179
LAURA: You've left us stranded. We're going to
die.

546
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,600
MARISHA: No, we're still there.

547
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,606
MATT: It takes a minute to revert to your actual
form to be able to do any sort of attack.

548
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,659
MARISHA: Man, that was going to be way cooler if
we could still...

549
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:17,268
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something insane. I've
got some plans.

550
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,637
MARISHA: It was a 6th-level spell.

551
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,732
MATT: I know.

552
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:21,171
SAM: It was so good.

553
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:25,199
MARISHA: Thanks, guys. I feel so validated.

554
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,201
LIAM: She just learned it yesterday!

555
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,926
MARISHA: I did just learn it yesterday.

556
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,304
MATT: Vax, it's your turn.

557
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:32,666
LIAM: And I'm made of wind?

558
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:36,334
MATT: You're made of wind. You can move. You can
dash, or you can begin to revert, if you'd like.

559
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:40,862
LIAM: I can begin to revert? So it's a minute-long
process that I have to consciously decide, and I

560
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:41,957
know this?

561
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:45,752
MATT: You get the feeling that if you want to
return, it will take you a while because you don't

562
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,329
really know what to do with your form.

563
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:48,716
MARISHA: We could try and get the fuck out of
here.

564
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:55,646
LIAM: I'm going to use disengage and I'm going to
fart over towards my sister and Pike.

565
00:36:55,646 --> 00:37:00,163
MATT: You cannot disengage. You can only dash in
this form.

566
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:03,637
LIAM: Oh, then I'm going to dash towards my sister
and Pike.

567
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,844
LAURA: Pike is on the other side. Me and Scanlan.

568
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:07,844
LIAM: Oh. Scanlan and Vex, sorry.

569
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,183
MATT: So you move over.

570
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,330
SAM: Not all short people look alike.

571
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:17,452
MATT: You dash over here. That guy's going to take
an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to

572
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:21,335
have disadvantage, technically, because you all of
a sudden stopped moving and it just hears the

573
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:27,819
sound. It rolled a three. No. It whips past you
with its mouth biting at nothing.

574
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:34,857
LIAM: I want to land and then start thinking, god,
I wish I was not made of farts, and start trying

575
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:36,381
to undo whatever this is.

576
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:38,559
MATT: Okay. Ten rounds later, you will be a
physical entity.

577
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,997
LAURA: Ten rounds?!

578
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,287
MATT: A minute.

579
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:43,000
LIAM: Dispel Magic, little man!

580
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,924
LAURA: Okay, can I see him? Can I shoot through
him?

581
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,810
MATT: You can shoot through him. He'll take half
damage.

582
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,290
LIAM: I'm crouching!

583
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,738
MARISHA: We could use this to our advantage and
get the fuck away, so I don't feel like I just

584
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:59,903
wasted a 6th-level spell. Just want to say.

585
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,166
LIAM: Fog of war, man.

586
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,687
MATT: Do you have Dispel Magic, Scanlan?

587
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,387
SAM: That would have been great.

588
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:08,172
(laughter)

589
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:11,387
MATT: Sorry.

590
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:18,211
MARISHA: I technically do, but fuck that.

591
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:20,703
LAURA: You can float up to the ceiling and then
attack from high.

592
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:22,339
MARISHA: I did learn Dispel Magic, but--

593
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:23,637
SAM: Well, dispel your own shit.

594
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:28,487
MARISHA: No! Figure it out! Make it work for
yourselves, assholes. That was a 6th-level spell,

595
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:29,738
god damn it.

596
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:31,120
MATT: Did you make yourself mist, as well?

597
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,374
MARISHA: Yeah! It's ten people!

598
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:34,196
MATT: You can't cast a spell in mist form,
either.

599
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:38,269
MARISHA: We're all shit out of luck! How does that
feel?

600
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:43,920
MATT: So who's left, currently? That finishes
Vax's turn.

601
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,505
LIAM: Everyone who's a cloud, we're floating back
to Emon. Let's go.

602
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:51,183
TALIESIN: (singing) I can show you the world.

603
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,977
MARISHA: I thought we could still attack, which
would be way dope.

604
00:38:53,977 --> 00:39:01,889
MATT: That would be dope, but that would be way
too powerful a spell for sixth level. This is more

605
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:06,934
of a means of travel spell, or a means of escape
spell.

606
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,555
LIAM: Let's solve the problem

607
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,476
LAURA: But half of the party is still not able to
escape.

608
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,512
MARISHA: If you don't move, they'll go away.

609
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:21,250
MATT: This creature, now, having been hit by the
terrifying Eyebite spell, its insides churning and

610
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,203
the impact from damage it's taken, it's looking
like it had a harsh round last turn. As all of the

611
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:30,879
movement suddenly (poof) vanishes and there's no
general movement, the last thing it recalls that

612
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:34,343
was in its vicinity and still shifting with a
heartbeat across the ground is you, Scanlan.

613
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:39,349
(impact noise) It bursts out of the ground right
in front of you. It brings its jaw down over the

614
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:45,740
top, with disadvantage. That's a natural 20, so
thank god it has disadvantage. 19.

615
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,778
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to try and not
have it hit me.

616
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:52,866
MATT: Okay.

617
00:39:52,866 --> 00:40:03,510
SAM: I'll sing, (singing) do you really want to
hurt me? Do you really want to bite my body? Okay,

618
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,963
that taunts him.

619
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:07,297
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10 to reduce that
from the attack.

620
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:10,759
SAM: A d10. this one? Wait, that's yours; why am I
doing yours?

621
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,215
MATT: That's a 19 plus nine. This is 28 is what it
rolled total.

622
00:40:13,215 --> 00:40:14,807
SAM: 28 is what it rolled total?!

623
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:16,093
MATT: It rolled a 19 on the dice.

624
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:20,260
SAM: Oh fuck, even if I rolled a ten, I couldn't
do anything. I rolled a three.

625
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,642
MATT: Okay, so as you're singing this, its jaw
comes down on you (slamming sound), bites down

626
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:28,823
painfully onto Scanlan for-- that's the wrong
dice--

627
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:30,736
TALIESIN: This could go worse.

628
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,515
MARISHA: Shut up, Taliesin.

629
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:37,885
MATT: 19 points of piercing damage. And I need you
to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

630
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:50,856
SAM: I'm great at those. Dexterity saving throw.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, that's a five.

631
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:55,552
MATT: Those of you who are watching, you see as
the mouth (impact sound) chomps down on Scanlan

632
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:00,234
and as it pulls away, Scanlan is nowhere in sight,
having been swallowed by the purple worm.

633
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:02,150
TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

634
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:12,781
MATT: You are blinded and restrained, and yeah.
You just see darkness and you feel the muscles

635
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:17,234
constricting as you're forced down its throat. As
your feet splash into what seems to be some sort

636
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:20,055
of highly acidic liquid that resides in the inside
of its body.

637
00:41:20,055 --> 00:41:27,408
SAM: Tell me this, Dungeon Master. Earlier when I
had done my Eyebite thing, I had my cone up here.

638
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:30,511
When he grabbed me was the cone still close to my
mouth?

639
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:34,479
MATT: Sure, we'll say that. However, I do need you
to make a concentration check because of the

640
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:35,988
damage you sustained on this.

641
00:41:35,988 --> 00:41:41,592
SAM: Okay. Concentration check. Concentration?
I've never rolled for concentration. Oh wait!

642
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:43,278
MATT: I know, I'm trying to keep up on that more
now.

643
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:47,846
SAM: I have advantage on spell concentration.

644
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:49,389
MATT: Because of your feat that you took.

645
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:54,614
SAM: Well, that wasn't good either. So one was a
five and one was a ten. Do I add anything to that?

646
00:41:54,614 --> 00:42:00,938
MATT: All right so, it's a constitution saving
throw and half the damage you took. So you're

647
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,966
trying to beat a nine.

648
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:05,313
SAM: Constitution. So 12.

649
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:08,102
MATT: So 12. So yes, you succeed. So you
currently, even though you're constrained, you're

650
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:12,014
still maintaining your Eyebite spell against the
purple worm.

651
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:13,272
SAM: Okay.

652
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:21,021
MATT: All right. So that ends the worm's turn.
Scanlan, it is now your turn.

653
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,723
SAM: Great. I don't want be in here anymore.

654
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:24,917
MATT: Correct.

655
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:35,216
SAM: Can I look around? It's dark. It seems cozy.
Seems nicer than outside right now, actually. I

656
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,346
dip my finger in the acid. Ooo!

657
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,348
MATT: (sizzling sound) Not fun, not fun.

658
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,797
SAM: It's not good. So I'm going to make him barf
me up.

659
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:45,517
MARISHA: Oh that's right, it was sick, right?

660
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:48,681
MATT: It's sickened currently by the spell effect
you put, yeah.

661
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:58,872
SAM; I'm going to cast, at level five,
Thunderwave. With my Hand Cone of Clarity up in my

662
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:02,899
grill. I'm going to explode him from the inside.

663
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:12,777
MATT: All right, Thunderwave. So at fifth level,
that would be an additional 4d8. That is 6d8

664
00:43:12,777 --> 00:43:14,317
thunder damage.

665
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:15,661
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

666
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:16,799
SAM: Where's the d8s?

667
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:18,390
MATT: It makes a constitution saving throw.

668
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,016
TRAVIS: He's inside. Come on, Armageddon this
motherfucker.

669
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,665
MATT: That is a 16 on the saving throw.

670
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,827
SAM: 19 is my save.

671
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:29,178
MATT: So, 6d8.

672
00:43:29,178 --> 00:43:43,885
SAM: What's that? I've already lost count. 15 plus
seven. Whatever that is.

673
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:45,027
MATT: 22 points of--

674
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:46,347
SAM: Wait 6d8, yeah okay.

675
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:51,330
MATT: Okay. It (impact sound) booms from the
inside and you can see a central part of the worm

676
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:59,226
(muffled boom) billow out like a cartoon as this
bit of smoke emanates from its mouth. Just the

677
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:03,490
sheer force of it forces you a little ways up its
throat, but not enough to jettison yourself out of

678
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:09,209
its body. Its muscles are too strong and you feel
like you need to do a little more damage to it

679
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:11,436
from the inside to be able to escape.

680
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:13,192
SAM: Okay. But it did hurt it, yes?

681
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:18,384
MATT: It hurt it, yeah. It took some damage. And
at this point as well, you (grunt) feel

682
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:26,497
your body being pulled inward and crushed by the
muscles. Percy. You're up, Mr. Mistform.

683
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,443
TALIESIN: Okay. These creatures have no eyes.

684
00:44:28,443 --> 00:44:29,628
MATT: Correct.

685
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:30,867
TALIESIN: I'm made of smoke.

686
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:32,673
MATT: (affirmative sound)

687
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:35,846
TALIESIN: (sighs) Okay.

688
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:38,632
TRAVIS: Yes. Well established.

689
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:51,049
TALIESIN: As long as we're all clear here what's
going on, that's fine. And I can just dash?

690
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:54,499
MATT: That's all you can do. Or begin to try and
revert, which will take ten rounds.

691
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:58,623
TALIESIN: Well, and can I still move around and do
things while I'm trying to revert or is it--

692
00:44:58,623 --> 00:45:01,272
Reverting. Am I just stuck reverting?

693
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:03,154
MATT: You know, that's a good question.

694
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:04,655
TALIESIN: Can I just make the decision?

695
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:07,174
MATT: I think you can still move around, you just
think you have to have concentration towards it,

696
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,537
I'll have to--

697
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:13,636
TALIESIN: I'm going to have my concentration on
reverting. But in the meantime, I'm going to--

698
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:15,853
MATT: You can use your action to begin to revert
your form, yeah.

699
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:17,141
TALIESIN: I have to use my action?

700
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,338
MATT: However, nope! Reverting takes a minute,
during which time a creature is incapacitated and

701
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:21,352
can't move.

702
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,441
TALIESIN: (sputtering)

703
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,466
MATT: So yeah. So currently--

704
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:25,357
MARISHA: Yeah he's really married to this one.

705
00:45:25,357 --> 00:45:28,905
MATT: It took me ten seconds to read it!

706
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:33,529
LIAM: So to get out of this form, we have to stop
and like meditate in one position for a full

707
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:37,851
minute. What does it dissipate without doing that?
How long does it take?

708
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:38,820
MATT: Eight hours.

709
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,918
LIAM: Eight hours, good.

710
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:43,629
MARISHA: Wait, what? No, no, no! One-- Oh no,
yeah, you're right.

711
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:47,848
SAM: Can't you just kill it? Wait a second, hold
on a second.

712
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:51,255
MARISHA: Yeah, can I not kill it at all? I can't
kill it?

713
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:53,000
MATT: Not if you're in wind form, no.

714
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,250
MARISHA: Question. Can I switch to an animal form?

715
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,386
MATT: You cannot take any other action aside from
dash or reverting when in this form.

716
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:04,117
TALIESIN: Can I dash into one of the creatures?

717
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:05,849
MARISHA: Why would you do that?

718
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:09,583
MATT: I mean, you could try to. You would surround
it with smoke.

719
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,096
LAURA: You're made of wind!

720
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:12,618
TALIESIN: It wouldn't know that I was there? It
wouldn't--

721
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:14,673
TRAVIS: You could either dispel it or you could
flee.

722
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:18,216
TALIESIN: Okay, well I had the thought of maybe I
could attempt to get them to attack each other.

723
00:46:18,216 --> 00:46:24,742
MATT: I mean, that can be attempted. How are you
going to do that? No, you can't talk in this form.

724
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:27,246
What are you trying to do?

725
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:33,278
TALIESIN: I'm attempting to tap them to get them
to think that there's something happening where

726
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:35,102
the worms are to get them to attack.

727
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:36,707
SAM: Like a Three Stooges thing.

728
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:42,427
MATT: Okay, so you swirl this way as a dash and
attempt to make an impact. I'll say go ahead and

729
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,738
make a strength check.

730
00:46:45,738 --> 00:46:47,097
TALIESIN: Really?

731
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:52,167
MATT: Yes. With disadvantage and a serious
penalty. <i>Because you're mist.</i> Go for it.

732
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:58,244
TALIESIN: Natural 20, Motherfucker!

733
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:00,990
MATT: Okay, roll again, because it's with
disadvantage.

734
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,057
TALIESIN: (screams)

735
00:47:02,057 --> 00:47:05,858
(laughter)

736
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:07,641
LIAM: Here comes the one.

737
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:14,233
TALIESIN: Baby, I know we've been arguing a lot
lately. But I want you to know I take it all back,

738
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:20,136
I take it all back. I'm going to buy you something
so nice. I'm going to buy you ice cream. I'm going

739
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:26,142
to buy you good ice cream! I'm going to go to
Scoops. Three, motherfucker.

740
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:27,672
(laughter)

741
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:29,025
TALIESIN: Which brings me to four.

742
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:37,482
MATT: All right. As the coldish mist of Percy
batters itself helplessly and ineffective against

743
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:45,333
the body of the giant frost worm creature, seeming
to no effect as it's now keeping itself attentive

744
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:48,768
on what is nearby and within its range of motion.

745
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:52,144
TALIESIN: I will use an action surge and start
turning back into a normal human then.

746
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:54,551
MATT: Well, you can continue to use your movement;
you only moved a short bit.

747
00:47:54,551 --> 00:48:00,129
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to move behind it then.
That way. No, I mean far away from it. And then

748
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,859
I'm going to use an action surge and start
meditating on it.

749
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:07,484
MATT: Okay, it does attempt to take an attack of
opportunity as it just feels you rush by. Nah, it

750
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,099
misses. Rolled a two.

751
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:11,143
TALIESIN: That's what it feels like,
motherfucker.

752
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:13,668
MATT: All right. So, that end your turn?

753
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:14,893
TALIESIN: Yeah that ended it.

754
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,401
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

755
00:48:16,401 --> 00:48:17,424
LAURA: Cool.

756
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:21,054
SAM: Vex, you and me babe, all we got to do is
last ten rounds. Of course, all you hear is

757
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:22,943
(muffled cries).

758
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,243
LAURA: I know, I've got to save you!

759
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,337
TALIESIN: Trinket's there too.

760
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:27,785
LAURA: I know.

761
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:34,721
MATT: Oh, I get to make the save to see if the
Eyebite maintains itself. That would be a-- no, it

762
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:38,354
rolled a ten and it's minus two on its wisdom
save. So it still has disadvantage on its attacks.

763
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:48,352
LAURA: Okay, all right. Are there any stalactites
coming from the ceiling?

764
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:54,703
MATT: There are, actually. There's a number of
them. Just in this general vicinity there's a

765
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:57,550
whole mess of them up above from just the natural
formation of it.

766
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:06,900
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage at
the ceiling and try to create noise away from us.

767
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,176
MATT: Whereabouts?

768
00:49:08,176 --> 00:49:11,091
LAURA: How about towards the ceiling above the
frost worm?

769
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:22,278
MATT: Over there? Okay. All right, so, okay. The
frost worm is in the way to hit that angle, so you

770
00:49:22,278 --> 00:49:23,990
may have to move to do so.

771
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:30,599
LAURA: Which way could I shoot that he would not
be in the way?

772
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:36,461
MATT: You have to probably move this way to get
around him just to hit him at this angle just

773
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:38,612
because it's such a large entity.

774
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:50,012
LAURA: Huh? God, I don't know. I mean.

775
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:51,262
MATT: What you got?

776
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:56,436
LAURA: I'm going to move as quietly as I can
around towards that little crevice.

777
00:49:56,436 --> 00:49:59,941
MATT: Go ahead and make a general dexterity
check.

778
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:11,917
LAURA: Just add my dexterity to it? 17?

779
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:23,549
MATT: 17? Okay. As you move past, stepping as
gingerly as you can, you can see it slap; it moves

780
00:50:23,549 --> 00:50:27,158
its face in the direction of where you're going,
but you just manage to move beyond where it

781
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:31,366
thought you were, and it misses you as you move
by. So now you have visual on it.

782
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:35,935
LAURA: Okay. Now I want to shoot Conjure Barrage
at the ceiling above the frost one.

783
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:39,549
MATT: Okay. Conjure Barrage up here. Go ahead and
roll damage.

784
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:57,247
LAURA: Okay. That is 3d8, I guess. 14 plus five.
What's 14 plus five? 19.

785
00:50:57,247 --> 00:51:04,454
MATT: 19 damage? All right. And with that, you
release a blasting torrent of arrows at the

786
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:10,610
ceiling in this giant cone blast. It strikes into
the ceiling through the force of the magical bow

787
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,016
that you're holding. You can see a number of rocks
in bits and pieces begin to chip off, and a few

788
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:27,186
small stalactites crack and plummet downward. I
need a dex save from Grog and Keyleth.

789
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:30,543
MARISHA: Dex save?

790
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:31,862
MATT: Dex save.

791
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:33,840
LIAM: We still take damage in this form, right?

792
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,258
MATT: You do. You just take half damage from
non-magical sources.

793
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:40,053
MARISHA: Regular dexterity save or do we get
advantage because we're misty?

794
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:41,940
MATT: You have resistance to non-magical weapons.

795
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,349
MARISHA: Do we have advantage?

796
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,382
MATT: No. You take half damage because you're
misty.

797
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:48,900
MARISHA: I don't think I made my dexterity check.

798
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,255
MATT: What did you roll?

799
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,252
MARISHA: A two.

800
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:58,558
TRAVIS: I have advantage. Danger sense. Dexterity
saving throws. Total of 20.

801
00:51:58,558 --> 00:52:05,860
MATT: There you go. All right, so that is a total
of seven damage to Keyleth, halved to four because

802
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,027
you're in mist form. Seven damage to the frost
worm.

803
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:12,010
LAURA: Seven damage because of the stalactites?

804
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:16,448
MATT: Yep. They fell on it. Four damage to you.

805
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:22,797
LAURA: I'm going to look over at Trinket, and I'm
going to go--

806
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:25,541
MATT: Actually, no damage to you because you
completely dodged out of the way.

807
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:32,655
LAURA: I'm going to go like this to Trinket, and
I'm going to shoot another arrow. I can't do the

808
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:36,711
same thing. I'm going to shoot an arrow at the
ceiling right above the frost thing, and then I'm

809
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:38,532
going to use my bonus action to hide.

810
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,011
MATT: Okay.

811
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:47,852
LAURA: Okay. Oh, god. That didn't do any-- Well, I
was hitting a stalactite, which is totally still,

812
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:49,333
so it was 13?

813
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:56,736
MATT: 13? Because of your half-elf eyes, able to
see in this dark interior of the cavern, I'd say

814
00:52:56,736 --> 00:52:58,826
yes, that hits. Barely.

815
00:52:58,826 --> 00:53:03,595
LAURA: So just a regular d8. Yep. 11.

816
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:11,956
MATT: 11 damage, all right. 11 damage. It falls. Yeah,
it does not make its resistance to the fall, so

817
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:16,775
the stalactite falls. Larger than the previous
ones that were knocked out by the barrage that

818
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:22,000
loosened it up. This one crumbles, slamming into
the head of the frost worm for three points of

819
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,476
bludgeoning damage. All right.

820
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:29,851
LAURA: And then I stealth for 21 points of
stealth.

821
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:37,855
MATT: Okay, good to know. All right. Ending your
turn, it's now Pike. Pike, who currently is

822
00:53:37,855 --> 00:53:43,484
confused by the circumstances that have currently
happened. She steps out. She's not mist. She steps out.

823
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:47,898
LAURA: Why would you do that?! Why would you do
that? You're going to kill her.

824
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:49,350
TRAVIS: She would know better than that!

825
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,679
LAURA: She would hide!

826
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:53,059
LIAM: She could be our saving grace. Let the
man--

827
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:54,973
SAM: She's the only one who's got arms and legs
right now.

828
00:53:54,973 --> 00:54:01,262
MATT: Keyleth left the alcove after saying stay
still, she saw a few individuals turn to mist on

829
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:05,464
the outside. She's very worried and confused by
the circumstances.

830
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:11,770
LAURA: I'm sorry, I didn't shoot an arrow. I just
realized I didn't shoot an arrow at his worm and I

831
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,474
meant to, and I'm sorry.

832
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:14,933
SAM: What worm? My worm?

833
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,342
LAURA: The one that you're in.

834
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:18,305
SAM: You could have hit me! It's okay. Don't
worry.

835
00:54:18,305 --> 00:54:29,623
MATT: Pike comes around the corner. "Guys? What's
happening?" And all she sees is you disappear into

836
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:34,616
the shadows on the side, Trinket being very quiet,
and mist swirling in the space around as these two

837
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:37,295
giant worms (growls) as parts of the cavern are
collapsing into it.

838
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:40,400
LAURA: Can I do that to her?

839
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,212
MATT: She doesn't see you do it because you're
hidden. No, she doesn't see you. She doesn't roll

840
00:54:46,212 --> 00:54:51,195
high enough perception. Right now, she feels alone
and doesn't understand what she can possibly do in

841
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:55,573
this. She doesn't have any indication of what to
do in the circumstance, so she is going to--

842
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:57,703
TRAVIS: Does Pike have Dispel Magic?

843
00:54:57,703 --> 00:54:59,439
MATT: She does.

844
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:01,301
SAM: She doesn't even know--

845
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:07,572
MATT: She doesn't know what's happening. She's
going to cast Flame Strike, 5th-level spell. It's

846
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:13,547
a ten-foot radius. She's going to blast this one
right here, which is the one she sees now closest

847
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:21,538
to her proximity and being ice-based. So that's
8d6 radiant damage.

848
00:55:21,538 --> 00:55:23,681
SAM: Hey! Nice job, Pike!

849
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:40,381
MATT: 32 points of fire damage. Does not make its
save. Suddenly from the ground, you see the rocks

850
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:45,718
shake and lift for a second before a beam of
divine fire (explosion) comes bursting out of the

851
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:52,519
ground in a ten-foot radius around this worm.
However, I do need a dexterity saving throw from

852
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,532
both Grog and Keyleth.

853
00:55:54,532 --> 00:55:55,806
TRAVIS: Okay.

854
00:55:55,806 --> 00:55:58,700
LIAM: Keep your head in the game!

855
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,439
TRAVIS: 18.

856
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:02,292
MARISHA: What? Shut up, Liam.

857
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,968
LIAM: Get it. Get it, girl, get it.

858
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:05,299
MARISHA: 16.

859
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:25,140
MATT: 16? So that's going to be 32 damage to that.
That's going to be 16 damage to you, Grog, and 32

860
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,903
damage to you, Keyleth.

861
00:56:26,903 --> 00:56:29,587
MARISHA: All right, 32.

862
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:35,666
MATT: Fire and radiant damage. As she just sees
mist in the air around the frost worm and has no

863
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:41,346
indication of exactly what happened. However, the
frost worm did take it as well. That's going to

864
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:45,643
end her turn as she isn't quite sure what to do at
that point. That brings us to the top of the round, Grog.

865
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:50,905
TRAVIS: What do I--? I can't leave.

866
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:52,709
LAURA: Just back away from it.

867
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:59,048
TRAVIS: I'll just back up to the tunnel leading
out of the-- yeah.

868
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,493
MATT: Okay.

869
00:57:00,493 --> 00:57:05,115
All right, that brings us to--

870
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:07,718
TRAVIS: Oh, and I'd like to start to revert, if I
could.

871
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:12,196
MATT: Okay. You'll be there for a minute
doing so. You can't move any further. You can't

872
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,516
move, you're just sitting there focusing on--
incapacitated.

873
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:15,991
TRAVIS: No, I don't start to revert.

874
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:22,309
MATT: Okay. All right, that completes your turn.
Now we come to the frost worm's turn. The frost

875
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:36,699
worm, first and foremost, it gets its frost breath
back. It turns this way, burrows underneath, and,

876
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:43,864
seeing all the movement to this side, goes ahead
and unleashes a secondary frost breath in this

877
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:50,399
direction. That will only affect the purple worm
and Vax. I need you guys to make constitution

878
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:51,805
saving throws.

879
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:56,254
LIAM: And I can't remember, Evasion has nothing to
do with this?

880
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:57,558
MATT: Correct.

881
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:04,451
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use Luck. My last Luck.
That's not good. So constitution save?

882
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,944
MATT: Correct.

883
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:06,945
LIAM: Seven.

884
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:11,961
MATT: Seven? Nope. Purple worm also does not make
it, so that'll be to both of you...

885
00:58:11,961 --> 00:58:17,397
LAURA: So obviously these worms don't even care
about each other at all.

886
00:58:17,397 --> 00:58:26,112
MATT: No. Seemingly, in this moment you see now,
there is not a kinship between them. If anything,

887
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:34,698
they both arrived due to feeling the same movement
and one is currently now attacking whatever is

888
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:37,891
large and in the area that it doesn't recognise
the center movement of.

889
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:43,850
MARISHA: Does that mean we could just get them
fighting each other?

890
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,501
LAURA: That is what I'm thinking, we could get
them to fight.

891
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:50,577
MATT: 36 points of cold damage to you. 36 points
to the purple worm.

892
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:52,044
SAM: That halved?

893
00:58:52,044 --> 00:58:55,737
MATT: No, it is magical damage, not blunt damage,
so you just take it. Especially as mist, cold is

894
00:58:55,737 --> 00:58:59,608
bad as mist. All right, so with that, the
purple--

895
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:01,543
SAM: Wait. Doesn't my worm take it too?

896
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:03,544
MATT: He did. Both of them are still there.

897
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:04,795
SAM: Still alive?

898
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:10,625
MATT: Yeah. Looking a little rough, but it's still
alive. All right, that ends its turn. Now it's

899
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,096
Keyleth's turn.

900
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:18,654
MARISHA: Okay, here's my question.

901
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:19,901
MATT: Yep?

902
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:21,667
TRAVIS: Probably no.

903
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,714
MARISHA: I know.

904
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:26,152
(laughter)

905
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:28,097
SAM: Can I juggle while I'm a mist?

906
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:33,677
MATT: If you wanted to, because it is your spell
that you cast, even though it's technically not

907
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:35,096
concentration--

908
00:59:35,096 --> 00:59:37,916
MARISHA: I will say, we all failed in reading it,
also--

909
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,643
SAM: Don't do this, don't do this!

910
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:43,331
TALIESIN: (laughs) Can't win.

911
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,398
LAURA: It's also what? What does it say?

912
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:46,504
MARISHA: Nothing.

913
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,243
TALIESIN: I'll say it if it makes you feel
better?

914
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:50,316
LIAM: Why don't we let him say what he was going
to say?

915
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:51,619
MATT: What were you going to say?

916
00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:52,587
MARISHA: Nothing.

917
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:53,728
MATT: No, what's up?

918
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:55,308
MARISHA: I'm afraid now.

919
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:57,414
TALIESIN: As you should be. You're defying god.

920
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:59,533
SAM: What were you going to say, Matt?

921
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:02,967
MARISHA: Yeah, what were you going to say?
(laughs) I like that question.

922
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:07,762
LAURA: Yeah, right? Since you cast it, you could
break your concentration?

923
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:12,492
MATT: I'm saying, because you cast a spell that
wasn't a concentration spell, if it was a positive

924
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:15,988
effect, which it technically is, and you did not
want it, you could cancel the spell. I'd let you

925
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,807
do that. If you wanted to. What did I not read?

926
01:00:18,807 --> 01:00:22,154
MARISHA: We all failed in reading it.

927
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,212
TALIESIN: Casting time.

928
01:00:24,212 --> 01:00:25,483
MATT: One action.

929
01:00:25,483 --> 01:00:26,627
TALIESIN: No.

930
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,470
TALIESIN and MARISHA: One minute.

931
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,862
MATT: It says one action on my thing.

932
01:00:29,862 --> 01:00:32,075
MARISHA: It says one action on yours? It says one
minute on mine.

933
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:33,213
MATT: Does it?

934
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,639
MARISHA: Yes, it does.

935
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,734
MATT: Thank you, Fight Club Five.

936
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:40,095
MARISHA: No, it's different. It says casting time
one minute.

937
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,254
MATT: Let's see what the Player's Handbook says.

938
01:00:42,254 --> 01:00:44,852
TALIESIN: Consult the book.

939
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:49,000
LAURA: It doesn't matter, it already happened.

940
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,299
MARISHA: It already happened, so it doesn't
matter.

941
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,544
TRAVIS: Shouldn't there be an ad for Gilmore's
Glorious Goods right about now?

942
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:57,440
MARISHA: Yeah, it's already happened, we're already
committed.

943
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,292
MATT: In the Player's Handbook, Wind Walk is one
minute, you're right.

944
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,288
MARISHA: One minute. So Fight Club failed.

945
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:06,805
MATT: Fight Club Five failed.

946
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:10,564
SAM: This is a reverse ad for Fight Club Five.

947
01:01:10,564 --> 01:01:16,154
MATT: Or I have to update it. Either way. No, It
might have been fixed since, I've just got to update

948
01:01:16,154 --> 01:01:26,268
it. All right. Well, anyway. In a bit of druidic
inspiration, you manage to, very quickly, for the

949
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:27,399
first time--

950
01:01:27,399 --> 01:01:29,621
MARISHA: I mean, I'm still willing to commit to
it. It's fine.

951
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:34,140
MATT: Being as an Air Ashari, this is your realm
of expertise, and your first time using it, you

952
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,559
were so excited that you managed to accelerate the
casting of the spell, regardless of the situation

953
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,940
it may have created, so, what do you want to do?

954
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,157
MARISHA: So I accelerated the casting of the
spell.

955
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:45,413
LAURA: So you can cancel it if you feel like
canceling it.

956
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:47,193
SAM: If you want to.

957
01:01:47,193 --> 01:01:52,144
LAURA: Some people's brothers in the room are at a
really low health level right now. I don't know

958
01:01:52,144 --> 01:01:54,247
who we're talking about, but some people's
brothers--

959
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:57,528
MARISHA: Are you giving me an out because you feel
bad? Because if you're giving me an out--

960
01:01:57,528 --> 01:02:01,780
MATT: No, because technically it shouldn't have
happened, because it was a one-minute casting

961
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,241
time. There are many things in that spell that
were not read, by the caster, so I'm giving you

962
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:11,445
the opportunity to correct the mistake, if you
wish not to take it, you can.

963
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:13,213
TALIESIN: I read the card too, I didn't see it.

964
01:02:13,213 --> 01:02:15,379
MARISHA: He did read the card too, and we all
thought it was a good idea.

965
01:02:15,379 --> 01:02:18,149
MATT: This was a very hard and valuable lesson for
casters.

966
01:02:18,149 --> 01:02:20,299
LAURA: We're in the middle of a battle.

967
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:26,665
MARISHA: (laughing) For my own shame. All right
fine, I'll drop the spell 'cause I feel really bad

968
01:02:26,665 --> 01:02:33,538
about it. But on my way down, okay, here's my
question, because I want to make these fuckers

969
01:02:33,538 --> 01:02:38,148
fight each other. So, is there loose rock along
the edge of the wall?

970
01:02:38,148 --> 01:02:42,489
LAURA: I dropped stalactites on them. So yeah,
there's lots of loose rock.

971
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:45,146
MATT: Yeah. And there's rubble on the ground next
to it from where the original cave-in happened

972
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:47,323
MARISHA: Okay, so as I'm dropping the spell--

973
01:02:47,323 --> 01:02:52,625
MATT: All of you who are mist form now revert,
and you fall about five to ten feet and catch

974
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,782
yourself on the ground, no harm no foul.

975
01:02:54,782 --> 01:03:00,860
MARISHA: As I revert back can I slide down that
wall to create some--

976
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,492
MATT: Did you want to move first over here to do
it?

977
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,452
MARISHA: Yeah.

978
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:04,771
MATT: So you shift over, you drop the spell.

979
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:08,295
MARISHA: Uh-huh, I drop the spell, and as I drop
the spell I want to grab some wall and bring it

980
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:12,161
down to make a big vibration, right in between
these two motherfuckers.

981
01:03:12,161 --> 01:03:13,756
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

982
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:21,623
MARISHA: Oh, jeez Louise. Oh, that's not too bad.
It's not a saving throw.

983
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:23,988
MATT: Correct. Just a strength check; add your
strength modifier.

984
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:24,849
MARISHA: 18?

985
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:29,401
MATT: 18. All right. So, as you slide down, you
grab onto some of the loose rock and (rockslide)

986
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:34,052
they come tumbling down as you slide down. So you
land here, at the base of the two worms, and rocks

987
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:38,743
tumble around you at the base of the cave-in. And
you get the sensation that you may have made a

988
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:41,173
decent bit of racket right around your feet.

989
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:43,095
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Do I have any movement?

990
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:48,597
MATT: I'd say you have half your movement.

991
01:03:48,597 --> 01:04:00,696
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ. Can I just tiptoe
backwards towards Percy? Or should I-- You know

992
01:04:00,696 --> 01:04:04,860
what? I'm going to stay. I'm just going to stay
right there. Is that even worse of a decision?

993
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,427
MATT: I don't know. What do you want to do?

994
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:09,854
MARISHA: I'm just going to-- up against the wall.
And not move.

995
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:11,479
MATT: Okay. You're going to Doctor Grant this.

996
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:12,718
MARISHA: I'm going to Doctor Grant it.

997
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:16,790
MATT: Got it. Okay. Keyleth, that ends your turn,
Vax, you're up. You now have your physical form

998
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,743
again.

999
01:04:17,743 --> 01:04:27,800
LIAM: Okay. I look around really fast, run up to
my sister, give her a giant hug, and (magic sound)

1000
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,204
Dimension Door over to where Grog is.

1001
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,393
SAM: You can Dimension Door; I keep forgetting
that!

1002
01:04:33,393 --> 01:04:38,001
MATT: So as you rush over and grab onto her, you
both (poof!) in a Nightcrawler-esque poof of

1003
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:44,352
smoke, as it settles, you are both no longer
there, as-- What's the range on the Dimension Door?

1004
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:47,762
LIAM: Oh, it's so far, it's like 500 feet I
believe. I'll find it.

1005
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:57,152
MATT: I believe it is. Dimension Door, yeah, it's
fine. 300 feet, you're fine. You guys appear over

1006
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:58,982
by Grog now.

1007
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,508
LAURA: Is that the edge of a cliff over on that
side?

1008
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:06,205
MATT: It goes right to the edge, right there, and
this is where it would go down the side of a

1009
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:11,827
giant, icy mountain. You guys are at the very,
very top of a very cold, cragulous part of the

1010
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:13,082
Cliffkeep Mountains.

1011
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:14,190
LAURA: Got it.

1012
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:19,038
LIAM: I'm hasted; do I have one or two attacks at
this point?

1013
01:05:19,038 --> 01:05:20,394
MATT: You have one attack right now.

1014
01:05:20,394 --> 01:05:21,480
LIAM: One attack? Okay.

1015
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,871
MATT: You went up and did your action already.

1016
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:26,655
LIAM: Action. Okay. Well then, I'm going to throw
a dagger at the back of the frost one.

1017
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:28,405
MATT: Okay. What's the range on your dagger?

1018
01:05:28,405 --> 01:05:33,659
LIAM: It's 60 feet, Sharpshooter, no
disadvantage.

1019
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:42,382
MATT: 60 feet. Just misses. You go (knife sound)
and it just tumbles, scrapes across the ground,

1020
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:49,687
stops at the base of the worm, and then vanishes.
All right, that ends your turn. Now it is this

1021
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:54,547
guy's turn. At the top of his turn, Scanlan, you--
all right.

1022
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:56,470
SAM: I'm in a nice womb.

1023
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:01,931
MATT: You take...

1024
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:05,576
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

1025
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:07,801
TALIESIN: All the damage.

1026
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:10,354
TRAVIS: He grimaced. Still rolling.

1027
01:06:10,354 --> 01:06:16,242
MATT: 23 points of acid damage as it begins to
digest you from the inside.

1028
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:18,538
SAM: Aren't I immune to acid damage?

1029
01:06:18,538 --> 01:06:19,712
MATT: Are you?

1030
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:21,196
SAM: Because of the feast?

1031
01:06:21,196 --> 01:06:22,495
MATT: No, poison.

1032
01:06:22,495 --> 01:06:24,388
SAM: Isn't that the same thing?

1033
01:06:24,388 --> 01:06:27,127
MATT: No.

1034
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:28,855
(laughter)

1035
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:31,192
MATT: All right. So. The--

1036
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:35,039
LAURA: Somebody's got something of Acid
Resistance, though. Somebody has an item.

1037
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,453
LIAM: I had armor and I gave it to someone, I
don't have it anymore.

1038
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:43,504
MATT: As the frost worm and the purple worm are
now clashing in this space, they both turn,

1039
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:47,839
hearing the sound. Now, the frost damage that had
impacted the purple worm last turn, let's see if

1040
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:54,378
it-- Nope! It's going to retaliate for that, it's
going to attempt to make a bite attack against the

1041
01:06:54,378 --> 01:07:01,626
frost worm. That is going to be a 12, that is
going to miss. However, hearing the noise, it's

1042
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:10,038
going to make a tail attack at the direction that
Keyleth is-- That's a natural one. As it arcs

1043
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:13,545
through, it (impact) right next to your head and
then pulls out of the rubble. The rock to your

1044
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:18,242
left is now cracked and broken with a giant hole
where the stinger had placed itself.

1045
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,903
MARISHA: I hold my breath.

1046
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:26,178
MATT: Yeah. Disadvantage on those attacks from
that Eyebite is really bad. So that's been very

1047
01:07:26,178 --> 01:07:31,215
helpful from Scanlan's point. By the way, Scanlan,
make another concentration check because of the--

1048
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,238
SAM: Concentration check.

1049
01:07:33,238 --> 01:07:36,391
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 18 and 19.

1050
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:41,247
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Okay. That ends the
purple worm's turn, it's going to stay right

1051
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:48,975
there. Actually, no. It's going to burrow away, as
currently it's made its attacks. It's going to

1052
01:07:48,975 --> 01:07:55,539
burrow into the ground, and is currently not
within anyone's visual range.

1053
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:59,040
LAURA: I have it Hunter's Marked, can I feel it?

1054
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,071
MATT: You can sense that it's underneath the
ground, somewhere in this cavern.

1055
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:03,153
LAURA: Okay.

1056
01:08:03,153 --> 01:08:06,945
MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

1057
01:08:06,945 --> 01:08:10,600
SAM: It's going down.

1058
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,879
MATT: It's going through the ground, you feel it
moving around.

1059
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:15,818
TALIESIN: Shake it, shake it, shake it.

1060
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:19,823
SAM: So it has poison, right? It's poisoned me--
Oh, it has acid.

1061
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:22,911
MATT: Yeah. It's acid. You're feeling yourself
digest within its body.

1062
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:27,794
SAM: Can I make an intelligence check to see if I
know anything about these creatures?

1063
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:32,110
MATT: You can if you'd like to, from the inside of
its body, yeah, go ahead.

1064
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,538
SAM: Is that my action? No, it's...

1065
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:37,102
MATT: No, no, no, I'll let you do it because
you've been very close and personal with it.

1066
01:08:37,102 --> 01:08:39,086
TALIESIN: You've had a lot of time to think.

1067
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:45,914
SAM: Specifically what I'm trying to remember from
my encounters in the past is if it has any

1068
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:47,883
resistance to poison damage.

1069
01:08:47,883 --> 01:08:49,452
MATT: Go for it.

1070
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:52,187
SAM: What am I doing? Intelligence?

1071
01:08:52,187 --> 01:08:54,312
MATT: Intelligence. Add your intelligence
modifier.

1072
01:08:54,312 --> 01:08:55,585
SAM: 16. 16.

1073
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:59,112
MATT: 16, okay. You've heard of these types of
entities before. You're uncertain whether or not

1074
01:08:59,112 --> 01:09:04,477
it has a resistance to poison, per se. You get the
sensation probably, based on the fact that it uses

1075
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:09,918
poison, you would think so, but nothing else about
its body seems to be poison-related or of the

1076
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:11,165
essence of poison.

1077
01:09:11,165 --> 01:09:12,398
SAM: But it does use poison?

1078
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:17,304
MATT: As part of its tail. The stinger you saw it
use earlier does seem to have some--

1079
01:09:17,304 --> 01:09:19,117
SAM: Oh, gotcha. Okay, so it probably does have
poison resistance. Okay.

1080
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,143
MATT: You don't know. But you do know, also, that
if you were able to probably do enough damage from

1081
01:09:22,143 --> 01:09:27,120
the inside, it would probably throw you back up.
You also get the sense that since you're currently

1082
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,666
underground, now would be a bad time to do that.

1083
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:34,003
SAM: Well, I'm in a tunnel, right?

1084
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,459
MATT: As far as you know, yeah.

1085
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:37,454
LAURA: There could be other worms around.

1086
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:44,942
SAM: He disappeared down-- well, I don't know
anything! Okay, all right, I can feel him moving,

1087
01:09:44,942 --> 01:09:48,427
so I don't know where I am anymore. So I don't
want to Dimension Door out, because I don't know

1088
01:09:48,427 --> 01:09:54,812
where I'd end up. So instead I will cast Stinking
Cloud inside-- No, no, no! No. No, no. Cancel!

1089
01:09:54,812 --> 01:10:00,717
Belay that order! Shit! Because I think he's
immune to poison, so I'm not going to do that. I'm

1090
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:03,759
going to-- Fuck! There's nothing I can do!

1091
01:10:03,759 --> 01:10:06,394
LAURA: Can you take a healing potion in case he
starts to digest you some more?

1092
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:09,854
SAM: (strained) I'm like this right now. I can't
do anything.

1093
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:12,042
LAURA: Can you go like that, and get a healing
potion and (mumbled) go like that?

1094
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:21,638
SAM: I am My Left Foot. Yeah, I can't reach a
wand. I don't want to get rid of--

1095
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,537
MATT: You could Dimension Door, in theory.

1096
01:10:23,537 --> 01:10:25,313
SAM: But I don't know where I'd end up?

1097
01:10:25,313 --> 01:10:30,817
MATT: As part of the spell you can either
visualize a place you can see, or one you can

1098
01:10:30,817 --> 01:10:34,361
describe by stating distance and direction. So
you've already been inside the room, you know what

1099
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:36,735
it looks like, so if you think you're somewhat
close by--

1100
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:41,389
SAM: So even if I've moved since I saw it last, I
can still Dimension Door to where I think--?

1101
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:43,404
MATT: In theory, yeah.

1102
01:10:43,404 --> 01:10:46,348
SAM: Okay, then I will do that. I will do that.

1103
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:48,618
MATT: Okay. Where do you want to appear within the
room?

1104
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:51,949
SAM: I want to appear where Vex was before.

1105
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:53,969
MATT: Okay. So, you--

1106
01:10:53,969 --> 01:10:55,729
LAURA: No, I was further over.

1107
01:10:55,729 --> 01:11:00,624
MATT: He didn't see that. Last thing he saw was
you were right next to him before he got eaten. So

1108
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:04,288
you disappear from the inside of its stomach and
appear in a puff of smoke.

1109
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:10,869
SAM: Goo! Goo all over me! Ew! Oh, and then I
see-- I've seen the other worm before, right?

1110
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,441
MATT: Briefly, before you were swallowed, yes.

1111
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:18,212
SAM: And I get my bearings, and I can see Pike, I
can see Trinket.

1112
01:11:18,212 --> 01:11:20,504
MARISHA: You also see me against a wall right next
to you.

1113
01:11:20,504 --> 01:11:29,610
SAM: So I will shake it off, I will inspire
Keyleth and say, (singing) I only want to see you

1114
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,493
slicing up that purple worm!

1115
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:35,815
ALL: (singing) Purple worm! Purple worm!

1116
01:11:35,815 --> 01:11:38,113
SAM: Ooh! Okay, that's good.

1117
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:39,903
MATT: d10 inspiration die to you, Keyleth.

1118
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:42,148
MARISHA: I love that song!

1119
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:48,093
MATT: Ends your turn, Scanlan. Percy, you're up.
You just caught yourself on the ground on the far

1120
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:49,655
end, by the tunnel.

1121
01:11:49,655 --> 01:11:52,303
TALIESIN: I want to hold my turn until the other
worm returns.

1122
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:56,440
MATT: Hold your action, you mean? So you want to
move anywhere or are you going to stay where you are?

1123
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,978
TALIESIN: Not going to move anywhere, just going
to stay right there.

1124
01:11:57,978 --> 01:12:02,203
MATT: All right. Cool. That ends Percy's turn as
he's holding his action until it returns. Vex,

1125
01:12:02,203 --> 01:12:03,308
you're up.

1126
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:09,032
LAURA: I'm going to shoot from my Blazing
Bowstring at the icy worm.

1127
01:12:09,032 --> 01:12:10,584
MATT: That's your second and final use this day.

1128
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:15,928
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 17?

1129
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:22,403
MATT: 17 unfortunately misses. Your flaming arrow
streaks off the darkness of the cavern and just

1130
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:24,977
passes it before it slams against the far cave wall.

1131
01:12:24,977 --> 01:12:37,017
LAURA: Balls, balls, balls! So I'm going to
shoot-- Nope, not going to do that. I'm going to

1132
01:12:37,017 --> 01:12:38,969
shoot a regular old arrow at him!

1133
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:40,956
MATT: Do it! Hey, those are still helpful.

1134
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:47,616
LAURA: And it doesn't do anything. It goes right
past him, and hits the wall, and he looks towards

1135
01:12:47,616 --> 01:12:48,764
the wall.

1136
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,301
MATT: An arrow isn't a very hefty thing when it's
by itself hitting stonework. It makes a noise, you

1137
01:12:53,301 --> 01:12:57,237
can barely make out, we'll see if it's enough to
distract it. Are you going to stay where you are?

1138
01:12:57,237 --> 01:13:01,393
LAURA: Oh, I could have used my inspiration. I
should have used it on the Blazing Bowstring one.

1139
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:03,055
SAM: Hey man, whatever.

1140
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:07,243
MATT: What are you going to do? Are you going to
move? Do you want Trinket to move? Are you going

1141
01:13:07,243 --> 01:13:08,444
to stay where you are?

1142
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:09,711
LAURA: Everybody's staying!

1143
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:17,663
MATT: Okay, gotcha. All right, Pike, now, seeing
everyone revert, and seeing this kind of awkward

1144
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:21,185
situation of these creatures moving about is going
to-- Yeah, and-- She can't see you because you're

1145
01:13:21,185 --> 01:13:22,747
on the other side of the wall.

1146
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,723
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action to hide?

1147
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:25,708
MATT: Sure.

1148
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,170
LAURA: I do that!

1149
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,005
MATT: I would recommend moving to one side of the
cavern or the other, because right now you're

1150
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:33,313
still out in the open. It's kind of hard to hide
if you have nowhere to hide. But you also

1151
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:37,989
get the feeling that these creatures-- being
visually hidden is not affecting it at all.

1152
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:39,633
LAURA: Doesn't matter? Then I don't do anything!

1153
01:13:39,633 --> 01:13:44,372
MATT: All right. So you stay still. Pike stands
still, figuring that it was helpful last time but

1154
01:13:44,372 --> 01:13:48,806
feeling bad for accidentally-- now seeing the mist
reverting to her friends-- that she blasted them

1155
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:55,981
on the previous round. Let's see. She didn't
realized in the moment that you guys turned into

1156
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:57,626
mist while she was in the corner.

1157
01:13:57,626 --> 01:13:59,284
TRAVIS: It's all right. I've had worse.

1158
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:07,939
MATT: I'm pretty sure she has another 5th-level
spell, and this would be the last of them. She's

1159
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:12,647
going to go ahead and Flame Strike again on the
frost worm. This time centering it around there,

1160
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:19,468
so the ten-foot radius only hits the worm and
doesn't see any allies nearby. So that will be

1161
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:32,394
8d6. 33 points of damage.

1162
01:14:32,394 --> 01:14:34,234
LAURA: Go, Pike!

1163
01:14:34,234 --> 01:14:37,393
MATT: Natural 20 on the save, though, so it
takes half the damage.

1164
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:41,236
LAURA: Damn you! Dick.

1165
01:14:41,236 --> 01:14:47,366
MATT: 17 points to the frost worm. All right, Pike
casts that and then stays perfectly still in space,

1166
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:51,575
she still has some motion and some speech to it,
but her feet are planted firmly on the ground.

1167
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:55,482
Hopefully that's enough. And that finishes her
turn. Back to the top: Grog.

1168
01:14:55,482 --> 01:14:57,077
TRAVIS: Did you hold your action?

1169
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:57,973
TALIESIN: I held my action

1170
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:59,086
TRAVIS: Until when?

1171
01:14:59,086 --> 01:15:00,274
TALIESIN: Until the other worm returns.

1172
01:15:00,274 --> 01:15:01,445
TRAVIS: I'll do the same thing.

1173
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:15,458
MATT: Okay. The frost worm, it's now its turn. It
does not get its frost breath. However--

1174
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,569
TALIESIN: There's a rock slide to its right.

1175
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:23,965
MATT: It is! There is a rock slide. That Keyleth
is standing in. Thank you for the reminder.

1176
01:15:23,965 --> 01:15:25,821
TALIESIN: Damn it! Sorry.

1177
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,167
MARISHA: Thanks for that.

1178
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:31,646
MATT: It's going to turn around. You can see now,
its tail emerges, and it's going to arc up and try

1179
01:15:31,646 --> 01:15:35,821
and bite and slam in your direction with both sides
of its body at once. This tail does not have a

1180
01:15:35,821 --> 01:15:43,516
stinger on it, but it is still a giant bludgeoning
implement. First attack is going to be a 19 to hit?

1181
01:15:43,516 --> 01:15:44,776
MARISHA: Yeah.

1182
01:15:44,776 --> 01:15:47,930
MATT: Next one is going to be a 16 to hit.

1183
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:48,911
MARISHA: No.

1184
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,462
MATT: All right, so the tail slams on the ground
next to you, estimating your position and failing

1185
01:15:52,462 --> 01:15:56,082
and just hitting the rocks that you had slid down.
However, it does bite down with its open, icy

1186
01:15:56,082 --> 01:16:09,012
jaws. You take 17 points of piercing damage, as
well as an additional six points of cold damage.

1187
01:16:09,012 --> 01:16:12,676
MARISHA: Bringing it to a total of 22?

1188
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:14,421
MATT: 22, yeah.

1189
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:15,865
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1190
01:16:15,865 --> 01:16:19,400
MARISHA: I deserved that.

1191
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,273
TALIESIN: We live in a cold, cold world. No one
deserves anything.

1192
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:31,644
MATT: Let's see if it makes any sort of perception
check. Okay, cool. That ends its turn. It's now

1193
01:16:31,644 --> 01:16:33,074
Keyleth's turn.

1194
01:16:33,074 --> 01:16:36,780
MARISHA: So does it know that I'm there since it
just took a big chunk out of me?

1195
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,928
MATT: It senses that it impacted something and
something that reacted and tasted like it had been

1196
01:16:41,928 --> 01:16:45,408
bitten, so you get the sense that it knows 
you're there.

1197
01:16:45,408 --> 01:16:49,275
MARISHA: All right. I'm in arm's length of it,
right?

1198
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:50,467
MATT: You are.

1199
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:53,468
MARISHA: I'm going to reach out and cast Blight on
it.

1200
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:54,848
MATT: Okay.

1201
01:16:54,848 --> 01:16:58,341
TALIESIN: You touch me when you're trying to touch
the worm. I don't know how--

1202
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:07,708
MATT: Cast Blight on Taliesin! All right.
Constitution saving throw. What's the DC on that?

1203
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,122
MARISHA: 18.

1204
01:17:09,122 --> 01:17:12,789
MATT: 18. It does not make it. 16. So 8d8 necrotic
damage to it.

1205
01:17:12,789 --> 01:17:16,968
SAM: Necrotic damage? Best kind.

1206
01:17:16,968 --> 01:17:38,869
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. What was that? Seven. Seven
plus five. Seven, eight, 13, 16, and then another

1207
01:17:38,869 --> 01:17:47,756
12. Where was I at? 18. Oh, so 28, 32, 33 points.

1208
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:52,456
MATT: 33 points of necrotic damage to the frost
worm. As you reach out with your hand and grasp it, you

1209
01:17:52,456 --> 01:18:00,902
can see now its icy white exterior all of a sudden
shudders in place and you can see small cracks of

1210
01:18:00,902 --> 01:18:06,975
black veins begin to spring out from your hands
into its body. Its frozen breath all of a sudden

1211
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:14,049
thaws briefly into a dripping drool as it is
stunned momentarily, and it pulls away, wrestling

1212
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:19,315
itself from your grasp. It did not enjoy that at
all. So that's your action.

1213
01:18:19,315 --> 01:18:23,488
MARISHA: I'm going to once again not move. Can I
go ahead and cast Healing Word on myself?

1214
01:18:23,488 --> 01:18:27,567
MATT: As a bonus action? I don't see why not.

1215
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:40,277
MARISHA: Nine, total. That does help.

1216
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:43,583
MATT: That ends your turn, Keyleth. Vax, you're
up.

1217
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:52,915
LIAM: All right. I want to see if I can use the
haste to do double distance to get behind Pike in

1218
01:18:52,915 --> 01:18:56,925
that little alcove. If I can't go that far, I'll
use dash to get behind her.

1219
01:18:56,925 --> 01:18:58,587
MATT: You could. You can get behind her.

1220
01:18:58,587 --> 01:18:59,961
LIAM: Without the dash?

1221
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:02,372
MATT: Yeah, because of your haste, you can move 60
feet.

1222
01:19:02,372 --> 01:19:06,655
LIAM: I'm standing right behind her and I say,
Pike, I'm a little banged up. Dagger, dagger, dagger.

1223
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:14,667
MATT: Okay, go for it. It is just-- or no, it's
within 30 feet.

1224
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:19,258
LIAM: 17 for the first. 21 for the second.

1225
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:21,373
MATT: Hits, hits.

1226
01:19:21,373 --> 01:19:22,680
LIAM: 18 for the third.

1227
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,868
MATT: All three hit.

1228
01:19:23,868 --> 01:19:25,783
LAURA: Is it sneak attack because Keyleth's
standing right next to it?

1229
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:46,762
LIAM: All right, so first one is four. This is
doubled, so that's 15 plus... 16, 21, 25, 28, 36

1230
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:48,217
for the first.

1231
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,615
MATT: All right.

1232
01:19:49,615 --> 01:19:55,065
LIAM: Second one is nine, and the third one is
ten.

1233
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:57,382
TALIESIN: Damn.

1234
01:19:57,382 --> 01:20:02,559
MATT: All right, as your barrage of blades
(spinning noises) go spinning right over Pike's

1235
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:07,748
head, she feels the actual wind distortion (puff)
past her hair, sending strands kind of wafting in

1236
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:13,137
front of her face as she just stays perfectly
still, trusting you. The blades all (impacts)

1237
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:20,411
sinking into it, one of which strikes an area of the
side of its body armor where the plates on the

1238
01:20:20,411 --> 01:20:24,023
armor had seemed to be cracked from the blackened
veins from her Blight spell. As it does, the

1239
01:20:24,023 --> 01:20:30,154
dagger doesn't even stop and plunges directly into
its body, and you can see a gout of dark, deep red

1240
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:35,503
blood just (spurt) out from the wound. It
(screeches) shakes in place from the impact, the

1241
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:37,611
pain, it's starting to look a little harsh.

1242
01:20:37,611 --> 01:20:38,762
LIAM: Done.

1243
01:20:38,762 --> 01:20:41,443
MATT: All right, ends your turn! That brings us to
the purple worm.

1244
01:20:41,443 --> 01:20:43,855
LAURA: (singing) Purple worm.

1245
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:48,402
LAURA &amp; MARISHA: (singing) Purple worm.

1246
01:20:48,402 --> 01:20:51,912
MATT: Purple worm is going to now emerge from the
impact--

1247
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:54,758
MARISHA: Come on, fight the big cocksucker.

1248
01:20:54,758 --> 01:21:03,816
MATT: It's going to burst out from the ground
where you and Pike are as the last motion that it

1249
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:12,034
felt was you rushing over across the ground.
(boom) It comes tearing through, making its bite

1250
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:16,721
attack against you and its tail attack against you
as well, because of Pike not moving.

1251
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:17,953
LIAM: Question!

1252
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:18,842
MATT: Yes?

1253
01:21:18,842 --> 01:21:21,437
LIAM: Pike probably doesn't, but do I have any
advantage being that I'm in this little closed-in

1254
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:23,209
bubble?

1255
01:21:23,252 --> 01:21:26,980
MATT: Technically, no, because it has reach. And
it just kinda swerves around the inside and it

1256
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:33,430
knows this cavern pretty well as it's been through
here a few times. So. That's going to be a 23 to

1257
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,561
hit on you?

1258
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:35,846
LIAM: Of course that hits.

1259
01:21:35,846 --> 01:21:38,210
MATT: For the bite attack.

1260
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:40,148
SAM: Even with its disadvantage?

1261
01:21:40,148 --> 01:21:42,906
MATT: Oh, with the disadvantage-- sorry, the
second roll-- thank you for reminding me there. It

1262
01:21:42,906 --> 01:21:45,695
would have been a 13 on the second one plus nine,
that would be 20.

1263
01:21:45,695 --> 01:21:51,194
LIAM: Still hits! Uncanny Dodge please! To halve
the damage.

1264
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:54,874
MATT: To halve the damage? Yeah, you can do that
on this one. But first then there's the bite. I

1265
01:21:54,874 --> 01:21:59,782
will do that now. That is 21 points of piercing
damage?

1266
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,270
LIAM: Unconscious.

1267
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:02,576
MATT: With it halved?

1268
01:22:02,576 --> 01:22:04,107
LIAM: 21 halved?

1269
01:22:04,107 --> 01:22:05,582
MATT: 21 halved would put you at 11.

1270
01:22:05,582 --> 01:22:08,713
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Okay, no, I'm still on my feet.

1271
01:22:08,713 --> 01:22:09,861
MATT: Okay.

1272
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:12,817
LIAM: (dazed mumbling)

1273
01:22:12,817 --> 01:22:18,653
MATT: The tail stinger's going to swing at you
with disadvantage. That is 14. Rolled a six and a

1274
01:22:18,653 --> 01:22:25,419
five. So, as the bite clamps down at you its tail
tries to strike at you but misses entirely.

1275
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:28,953
However, its jaws attempt to close around you, I
need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

1276
01:22:28,953 --> 01:22:34,730
LIAM: Hold on. 16.

1277
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:39,069
MATT: 16. As you try and move out of the way, it's
not quite fast enough as darkness takes you, the

1278
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:42,407
mouth (slam shut sound) clamps around you, (gulp
noise) and you are swallowed.

1279
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:45,460
LAURA: You didn't even get healed! (panicked
gasp)

1280
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,522
LIAM: Still conscious.

1281
01:22:48,522 --> 01:22:54,314
MATT: That ends its turn. Now having it appeared,
as this round has happened, I would like both Grog

1282
01:22:54,314 --> 01:22:55,963
and Percy to--

1283
01:22:55,963 --> 01:23:04,290
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot the purple thing with
a violent shot.

1284
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:05,846
MATT: How many points into it?

1285
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:09,730
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop all three points into
violent shot.

1286
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:16,374
MATT: Okay! That adds plus six to your
misfire. So you have like a 46% chance of

1287
01:23:16,374 --> 01:23:18,023
misfiring on this shot.

1288
01:23:18,023 --> 01:23:20,233
TALIESIN: If I roll a six. A six or lower. It--

1289
01:23:20,233 --> 01:23:23,988
MATT: Well, it adds plus two to your misfire per
point spent.

1290
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:28,731
TALIESIN: Oh! Never mind then! Oh shit! Then never
mind. Then I'm just going to take two points of

1291
01:23:28,731 --> 01:23:30,175
violent shot. So that's--

1292
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:32,304
MATT: So that would bring it to a misfire of seven.

1293
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:33,199
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1294
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,602
MATT: Okay! So take your shot.

1295
01:23:34,602 --> 01:23:35,918
MARISHA: You misfire on a seven or lower?

1296
01:23:35,918 --> 01:23:36,671
TALIESIN: Yep.

1297
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:37,908
MARISHA: Holy shit, Taliesin!

1298
01:23:37,908 --> 01:23:40,048
MATT: But if he hits it's two additional dice
damage to it.

1299
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,772
MARISHA: Come on, Golden Snitch!

1300
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:45,867
TALIESIN: Seven.

1301
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:47,382
MATT: You rolled a seven?

1302
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:48,761
TALIESIN: I rolled a seven.

1303
01:23:48,761 --> 01:23:54,389
MATT: As you rear back, get ready to fire, all of
a sudden, you pull the trigger and the way that

1304
01:23:54,389 --> 01:24:00,650
you had customized the barrel to blast additional
black powder blows up in your face and the gun

1305
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,691
actually bends out of the way and you feel the
impact--

1306
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:08,004
TALIESIN: Wait! I get to reroll something, don't
I? Where is it? Where is it? Aw. Do I get a

1307
01:24:08,004 --> 01:24:09,188
reroll?

1308
01:24:09,188 --> 01:24:10,783
Yeah. One save reroll per---

1309
01:24:10,783 --> 01:24:16,239
MATT: That's a saving throw reroll, that's not an
attack, unfortunately. Yeah, the weapon misfires,

1310
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:20,937
doesn't do damage to you but the blast does not
take off. You would have to repair the Bad News to

1311
01:24:20,937 --> 01:24:22,314
use it again.

1312
01:24:22,314 --> 01:24:25,481
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to pull out my new gun
and take two shots.

1313
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,728
MATT: Okay, so you drop Bad News, take two shots.
Go for it.

1314
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,904
TALIESIN: God damn it. (sighs)

1315
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:33,053
TRAVIS: Come on, Percy!

1316
01:24:33,053 --> 01:24:35,502
TALIESIN: That hits! That's a 21.

1317
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:36,632
MATT: That hits.

1318
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:46,147
TALIESIN: I'm just going to roll the other one,
too. And that's a 30, that hits. So that's, plus

1319
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:54,965
12. Eight, 15, 25. That's 27 points of damage.

1320
01:24:54,965 --> 01:25:06,156
SAM: Lot of things going on in Matt Mercer's head
right now.

1321
01:25:06,156 --> 01:25:10,147
MATT: All right. How do you want to do this?

1322
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:13,756
MARISHA: Thank god! Such an asshole.

1323
01:25:13,756 --> 01:25:21,749
TALIESIN: Bad News is down, I toss it to the
ground, I pull out the new one. I take my shot

1324
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,008
just to get its attention to get one in the
mouth.

1325
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:28,049
MATT: Okay, as you take one shot (gunshot noise)
it blast the side of the wall, its head turns

1326
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:32,022
towards you, seeing the sudden movement, and as
you do you aim up, aiming for the back of its

1327
01:25:32,022 --> 01:25:35,737
head. You fire. This time the bullet strikes true,
right into the back of its throat. You can see now

1328
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:39,535
(explosion noise) the blowout which is a small
hole in the back of its throat, you can see the

1329
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:44,691
cavern behind it and a little bit of light that is
peeking through. It (groans) and just (impact)

1330
01:25:44,691 --> 01:25:50,923
falls across the ground here. The Eyebite spell no
longer effective but it is, currently, still

1331
01:25:50,923 --> 01:25:53,434
there, holding the area.

1332
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:55,054
LIAM: (muffled) I'm still in here.

1333
01:25:55,054 --> 01:25:58,698
MATT: Yep, you feel it (impact) collapse on the
ground and it's not moving and the muscles go lax

1334
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:00,049
around you.

1335
01:26:00,049 --> 01:26:01,697
LAURA: That's good, so you can move a little bit.

1336
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:03,466
MATT: It's now Grog's turn.

1337
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:11,175
TRAVIS: I can't go get him, though, 'cause the
other dick lord is still on the map.

1338
01:26:11,175 --> 01:26:15,847
LIAM: (muffled) I'm in acid in here.

1339
01:26:15,847 --> 01:26:25,329
TRAVIS: I can't get to him. I'll run up to the
dead earthworm and try and cut Vax out of his

1340
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:31,138
stupid stomach. With Craven Edge.

1341
01:26:31,138 --> 01:26:37,880
MATT: As you rush up, leaping onto the body of the
now-deceased purple worm, you bring the blade up

1342
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:44,865
and begin carving through. Go ahead and I'll say
you manage to, over the course of this round, you

1343
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:48,429
don't have to roll for it. You just begin to tear
through it with the blade repeatedly, gashing it

1344
01:26:48,429 --> 01:26:53,304
open until eventually you can feel the blows from
the outside.

1345
01:26:53,304 --> 01:26:56,594
TRAVIS: Did I just help midwife Vax out of this
thing?

1346
01:26:56,594 --> 01:27:02,126
MATT: Just a moment. I would like you to go ahead
and make an attack roll with disadvantage.

1347
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:03,691
LAURA: An attack.

1348
01:27:03,691 --> 01:27:07,712
TRAVIS: 20.

1349
01:27:07,712 --> 01:27:09,022
LIAM: Hits!

1350
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:11,191
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

1351
01:27:11,191 --> 01:27:13,738
LIAM: I mean, I'm unconscious.

1352
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:15,394
MARISHA: You're unconscious?

1353
01:27:15,394 --> 01:27:17,871
LAURA: Well, he will be once he takes his damage.

1354
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:19,182
TRAVIS: 17.

1355
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,270
LIAM: Unconscious--

1356
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:24,574
MATT: 17, so, as you strike through you feel
yourself hit something else within the purple

1357
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:32,893
worm, and as the wound opens up, you can see Vax's
bleeding, unconscious form slip out of the purple

1358
01:27:32,893 --> 01:27:35,625
worm's body, onto the ground of the icy cavern.

1359
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,221
TRAVIS: Ew.

1360
01:27:37,221 --> 01:27:42,131
LAURA: You just killed my brother.

1361
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:43,877
LIAM: I'm unconscious.

1362
01:27:43,877 --> 01:27:45,603
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

1363
01:27:45,603 --> 01:27:49,253
TRAVIS: It was only one-- it was a couple of
strikes to get him out, right?

1364
01:27:49,253 --> 01:27:50,504
MATT: Yeah.

1365
01:27:50,504 --> 01:27:52,875
TRAVIS: Yeah, that ends it.

1366
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:53,747
MATT: All right.

1367
01:27:53,747 --> 01:27:55,517
(laughter)

1368
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:56,459
SAM: Killed Vax.

1369
01:27:56,459 --> 01:28:00,127
MATT: That was your saved attack. Now, finishing
that turn, Scanlan, you are up.

1370
01:28:00,127 --> 01:28:18,160
SAM: Ah, me? oh. Hello, hello. (laughs) I will
kill it with fire. Well, let's see, can I see Vax

1371
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,894
over there in the worm juice?

1372
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,896
MATT: No, not from your position. As far as you
know, he's still been swallowed.

1373
01:28:22,896 --> 01:28:30,517
SAM: Then I'll kill it with fire. I will use my Wand
of Fireballs to blast balls at it.

1374
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:32,521
TALIESIN: Your balls of fire wand.

1375
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:36,017
SAM: My balls of fire, and I won't hit Key, will
I?

1376
01:28:36,017 --> 01:28:41,714
MATT: Currently, if you aim it properly. It's a
big radial spell.

1377
01:28:41,714 --> 01:28:44,277
LAURA: Oh no, it's going to get Keyleth.

1378
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:48,437
SAM: Oh, it's that radius!

1379
01:28:48,437 --> 01:28:51,388
MATT: Yes. You could aim it in such a way--

1380
01:28:51,388 --> 01:28:52,999
SAM: Forget it, I'll just do Lightning Bolt
instead.

1381
01:28:52,999 --> 01:28:54,127
MATT: Okay.

1382
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:55,593
LAURA: That's a huge radius.

1383
01:28:55,593 --> 01:29:00,314
MATT: Fireball's a powerful, dangerous spell, if
things are in close quarters, but against mass

1384
01:29:00,314 --> 01:29:03,665
amounts of enemies, it's brilliant.

1385
01:29:03,665 --> 01:29:09,167
SAM: So I take two steps to my right, so no one
else is in the line and I will lightning it

1386
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:10,013
instead.

1387
01:29:10,013 --> 01:29:12,318
MATT: All right. Go for it, go ahead and roll
damage.

1388
01:29:12,318 --> 01:29:13,903
SAM: 8d6, yeah?

1389
01:29:13,903 --> 01:29:18,088
MATT: Yep, that is an 11 on its dexterity saving
throw. Full damage.

1390
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:26,275
SAM: 31.

1391
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:31,431
MATT: 31 points of lightning damage to it. All
righty! As you step to the side, releasing the

1392
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:36,289
bolt of lighting energy, it blasts into the front
of its face. You can see one of its jaw mandibles

1393
01:29:36,289 --> 01:29:42,271
gets torn off from part of the impact, you can see
now the deep red blood begin to pool on the side

1394
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:45,420
of its face and drip down as it looks over,
whipping its head in your direction.

1395
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,052
SAM: (whimpers) Do I still have any movement?

1396
01:29:48,052 --> 01:29:51,468
MATT: Yeah, you only moved ten feet, so you still
have 15 more feet.

1397
01:29:51,468 --> 01:29:57,012
SAM: I'm going to try to shuffle back into the
tunnel there a little bit. And for my bonus, I'll

1398
01:29:57,012 --> 01:30:00,526
Healing Word myself.

1399
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:01,985
MATT: Go for it.

1400
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:07,446
SAM: Okay, what is that, d4? Great, yeah, six
points. Awesome.

1401
01:30:07,446 --> 01:30:10,339
MATT: All right, that finishes Scanlan's turn.
Percy, you're up.

1402
01:30:10,339 --> 01:30:16,840
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at the
big icy worm.

1403
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,096
MATT: Okay.

1404
01:30:18,096 --> 01:30:24,899
TALIESIN: I'm just going to take two normal,
everyday shots because things have been weird.

1405
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:31,867
It's got to be close to death now. That's 17.

1406
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:33,707
MATT: 17 just barely hits.

1407
01:30:33,707 --> 01:30:37,653
TALIESIN: And 24.

1408
01:30:37,653 --> 01:30:39,149
MATT: Okay, both hit.

1409
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:41,659
LAURA: Get it, Percy!

1410
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:43,734
MATT: Your pistol now needs to be reloaded.

1411
01:30:43,734 --> 01:30:54,656
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, that's my third-- Third attack
is to reload. I keep track, I'm good. 21 points of

1412
01:30:54,656 --> 01:30:55,836
damage.

1413
01:30:55,836 --> 01:30:59,981
MATT: Good. (gun firing twice) Both shots go off,
(click) the third one kind of clicking. You go to

1414
01:30:59,981 --> 01:31:05,469
reload, you can see both blast across the front of
its body, leaving little reddish dots on its

1415
01:31:05,469 --> 01:31:10,771
midsection as each bullet sinks into it. It's
still standing, still writhing about. You can see

1416
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:14,259
it's bleeding from many different wounds and it's
not looking too great, but it's still standing.

1417
01:31:14,259 --> 01:31:16,337
Stay where you are or you going to--?

1418
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,880
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm staying where I am.

1419
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,521
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

1420
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,413
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

1421
01:31:21,413 --> 01:31:22,653
MATT: All righty!

1422
01:31:22,653 --> 01:31:38,423
LAURA: And I'm going to shoot two arrows at him.
Because what else am I going to do? Oh, Pike can

1423
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:39,909
help you.

1424
01:31:39,909 --> 01:31:42,106
TRAVIS: He's unconscious; don't listen to that
piece of shit.

1425
01:31:42,106 --> 01:31:43,983
LAURA: I can't tell what happened; Grog went to
save you.

1426
01:31:43,983 --> 01:31:45,549
LIAM: Huh? Oh, yeah.

1427
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:48,083
LAURA: 29 on the first hit.

1428
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:49,380
MATT: 29 hits.

1429
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,465
LAURA: And 27 on the second hit.

1430
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:53,653
MATT: Both hit.

1431
01:31:53,653 --> 01:32:02,406
LAURA: Okay. 20 on the first hit.

1432
01:32:02,406 --> 01:32:04,199
MATT: Nice.

1433
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:10,133
LAURA: 18 on the second hit.

1434
01:32:10,133 --> 01:32:15,667
MATT: Got it. Both arrows (impacts) sticking into
its side, you can now see multitudes of the shafts

1435
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:21,324
sticking out. It's still standing. It's a hardy,
hardy creature. You want to move or you want to

1436
01:32:21,324 --> 01:32:23,024
stay where you are?

1437
01:32:23,024 --> 01:32:30,490
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am.

1438
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:35,505
MATT: Okay. That's all right, ends your turn.
Trinket's still sitting there wanting to help, but

1439
01:32:35,505 --> 01:32:38,532
not able to do anything. All right.

1440
01:32:38,532 --> 01:32:41,125
SAM: So you mean, Trinket is doing what Trinket
always--

1441
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:42,346
LAURA: Shut up!

1442
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:44,897
(laughter)

1443
01:32:44,897 --> 01:32:52,451
MATT: Pike screams out, "Vax!" and runs up the
body, climbs up to the top and jumps off, landing

1444
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:59,995
next to your unconscious self. Reaches down and is
going to use her one 6th-level spell, Heal.

1445
01:32:59,995 --> 01:33:01,702
MARISHA: Ooh!

1446
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:04,415
MATT: So you immediately regain 70 hit points.

1447
01:33:04,415 --> 01:33:06,017
LAURA: Whoa!

1448
01:33:06,017 --> 01:33:11,066
TRAVIS: It's like Pulp Fiction with the adrenaline
shot.

1449
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:21,306
MATT: Clerics, man! You come to consciousness,
taking the deep breath-- The cold air from the

1450
01:33:21,306 --> 01:33:26,067
cavern that you inhale stings your lungs, and you
look over and Pike's there before you, eyes wide.

1451
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:30,050
Goes from a serious frown and a worried, furrowed
brow to a big smile as you come back to

1452
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:32,710
consciousness. "Vax!" as she goes and hugs you.

1453
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:38,066
LIAM: And I clap my hand here and I leave a big,
gory, slimy smear right on the half of her face.

1454
01:33:38,066 --> 01:33:39,874
Thank you, Pike.

1455
01:33:39,874 --> 01:33:44,744
MATT: So you're back up, that finishes her round.
Grog, you're up.

1456
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:52,366
TRAVIS: We are still hungry! And I rush up to
giant dick smear.

1457
01:33:52,366 --> 01:33:55,473
MATT: Leaping over-- (grunt, running sounds)

1458
01:33:55,473 --> 01:34:01,478
TRAVIS: And I would like to use reckless attack on
my first of all three great weapon master.

1459
01:34:01,478 --> 01:34:03,454
MATT: Okay. You can use them all. All of them are
affected now.

1460
01:34:03,454 --> 01:34:04,658
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

1461
01:34:04,658 --> 01:34:06,863
MATT: All right! So, advantage on all of your
attacks.

1462
01:34:06,863 --> 01:34:09,772
TRAVIS: That's a 23.

1463
01:34:09,772 --> 01:34:10,982
MATT: Hits.

1464
01:34:10,982 --> 01:34:18,751
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. What's 29 minus five? 24.

1465
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:20,023
MATT: Hits.

1466
01:34:20,023 --> 01:34:21,560
TRAVIS: That probably--

1467
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,821
LAURA: That hits, too.

1468
01:34:22,821 --> 01:34:26,872
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got to do the math. 22.

1469
01:34:26,872 --> 01:34:29,273
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

1470
01:34:29,273 --> 01:34:47,556
TRAVIS: Okay. 12. 20, plus ten, 30 for the first
one. Eight. 13. 21, 31 for the second one.

1471
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:50,729
LAURA: Grog, you've never been so hot!

1472
01:34:50,729 --> 01:34:53,522
TRAVIS: Three, eight, 16, 26 for the third one.

1473
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:55,661
MATT: 26. How do you want to do this?

1474
01:34:55,661 --> 01:35:02,051
TRAVIS: I'd like to take Craven Edge and jump up,
straight up, as high as I can and drive it

1475
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:07,582
straight into the top of its cavity and just drag
it down and open it up like a beautiful bouquet.

1476
01:35:07,582 --> 01:35:15,010
MATT: As you see Grog staple himself to the top
of this now-standing, 20-25 foot tall creature,

1477
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:19,069
he, using his barbarian strength to leap up on the
top, sinking the blade into the back of its head.

1478
01:35:19,069 --> 01:35:24,516
Immediately it rears back, its whole back arching.
As it does so, you just use the heft of your

1479
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:29,319
weight, grinning as you drive the blade down the
entirety of its body. As you grind down to the

1480
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:35,041
surface, you can see its armored back just pop
open, like a freshly cooked sausage-- just the

1481
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:41,219
insides spill out onto the ground. By the time
Grog reaches the ground, you are coated in thick,

1482
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:46,502
thick crimson. Strangely enough, even though the
blood is liquid, you feel almost like this

1483
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:50,098
crystalline force, like there are actually ice
crystals within the blood stream itself from the

1484
01:35:50,098 --> 01:35:51,615
cold that emanates from its body--

1485
01:35:51,615 --> 01:35:52,590
TRAVIS: Like Icy Hot.

1486
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:56,244
MATT: Yes! And as you land and hit the ground, its
body slaps forward, barely missing Keyleth as it

1487
01:35:56,244 --> 01:36:01,254
wet hits the ground. Almost like a shrimp that had
its entire back torn open. It's just in two pieces

1488
01:36:01,254 --> 01:36:04,485
face down on the ground. Right there.

1489
01:36:04,485 --> 01:36:08,274
MARISHA: Good work, Grog.

1490
01:36:08,274 --> 01:36:13,270
TRAVIS: I want more. Who's next?

1491
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:14,681
LIAM: Shh!

1492
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:19,878
LAURA: Calm down, Grog! Calm your tits, Grog!

1493
01:36:19,878 --> 01:36:25,798
TRAVIS: Can I look in the blade and go: that was
good, wasn't it?

1494
01:36:25,798 --> 01:36:31,574
MATT: "You did good, my friend. Very, very good."

1495
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:40,335
MARISHA: Hi, Grog.

1496
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:42,644
SAM: Who you talking to, Grog?

1497
01:36:42,644 --> 01:36:45,505
TRAVIS: That was good, wasn't it?

1498
01:36:45,505 --> 01:36:47,756
MARISHA: It was very good, yeah! You did good!

1499
01:36:47,756 --> 01:36:49,507
TRAVIS: Well, fucking answer me next time, Jesus!

1500
01:36:49,507 --> 01:36:50,509
SAM: Sorry!

1501
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:54,507
LIAM: I speak quietly into the earring and say:
could everybody shut the fuck up, please, and can

1502
01:36:54,507 --> 01:36:56,831
we get out of here? Quietly?

1503
01:36:56,831 --> 01:36:59,491
LAURA: No! There's gold! There's lots of gold on
the other side!

1504
01:36:59,491 --> 01:37:01,955
LIAM: Yeah, let's call another two worms, let's do
that.

1505
01:37:01,955 --> 01:37:05,809
SAM: These are probably the only ones! It's a male
and a female!

1506
01:37:05,809 --> 01:37:07,564
MARISHA: How do you know that!?

1507
01:37:07,564 --> 01:37:10,980
LIAM: They fucking hated each other. They hated
each other!

1508
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,726
MARISHA: Yeah! They were trying to kill each
other!

1509
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:15,267
SAM: Yeah! They were married! They're a married
couple! They hate each other!

1510
01:37:15,267 --> 01:37:18,067
MARISHA: Scanlan, that's only your relationships!

1511
01:37:18,067 --> 01:37:21,823
LAURA: Scanlan, you're right there. Get as much
gold as you can and Dimension Door over to the

1512
01:37:21,823 --> 01:37:23,067
teleporter.

1513
01:37:23,067 --> 01:37:24,383
SAM: I'm here? What?

1514
01:37:24,383 --> 01:37:25,879
LAURA: You're right by the gold!

1515
01:37:25,879 --> 01:37:27,657
SAM: Oh you mean, I'm going to get the gold?!

1516
01:37:27,657 --> 01:37:28,999
LAURA: Get the gold and Dimension Door!

1517
01:37:28,999 --> 01:37:33,275
SAM: I don't have a Bag of Holding! I weigh 14
pounds! I can't hold that much gold! Gold is

1518
01:37:33,275 --> 01:37:34,235
heavy!

1519
01:37:34,235 --> 01:37:37,576
TRAVIS: I can get over there. Do we want gold?

1520
01:37:37,576 --> 01:37:41,158
SAM: Yes, we want fucking gold! Wait, isn't there
gold all over the place?

1521
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:46,278
MATT: It's like smatterings of single pieces
across the floor, but this one tunnel, the hoard

1522
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,507
itself is pouring into the tunnel left behind.

1523
01:37:48,507 --> 01:37:49,927
LAURA: I need it!

1524
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:53,260
TALIESIN: Go grab the gold, let's get the body,
and we'll get out of here. We have to search the

1525
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:54,469
body as well.

1526
01:37:54,469 --> 01:37:57,725
TRAVIS: I run over to the gold. I run around the
worm and run to the gold. And I (yelling) frenzied

1527
01:37:57,725 --> 01:38:02,790
rage-loot this shit!. Just hacking away at it!

1528
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,893
MATT: Slapping the stone and pouring all the rest
of the gold you can get your hands on inside this--

1529
01:38:05,893 --> 01:38:13,796
SAM: I'll assist. Grog, Grog! Open the bag!
(singing) Bigby's Hand will grab the gold.

1530
01:38:13,796 --> 01:38:15,388
(laughter)

1531
01:38:15,388 --> 01:38:18,023
LAURA: Yes! Oh my gosh, get so much gold!

1532
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:22,058
MATT: Giant scoops into the Bag of Holding. It's
just pouring off the sides of it onto the ground

1533
01:38:22,058 --> 01:38:23,852
and you're having to scoop it back up inside.

1534
01:38:23,852 --> 01:38:27,924
MARISHA: I take out like my little filet knife and
I start going to town on the frost worm in front

1535
01:38:27,924 --> 01:38:31,481
of me, trying to salvage anything that I can from
him.

1536
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:32,644
MATT: Okay!

1537
01:38:32,644 --> 01:38:35,143
LAURA: I call Trinket and I tell him to get over
by the teleportation circle.

1538
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:36,858
MATT: Make a nature check real fast.

1539
01:38:36,858 --> 01:38:38,606
MARISHA: My book! I got my book!

1540
01:38:38,606 --> 01:38:40,085
SAM: Who, me? Nature check?

1541
01:38:40,085 --> 01:38:44,325
MARISHA: It's me. I got my book, which gives me
advantage.

1542
01:38:44,325 --> 01:38:48,532
LIAM: I'm meeting Trinket, and I'm going to
lay-slash-nap on his back.

1543
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:50,122
MARISHA: 29.

1544
01:38:50,122 --> 01:38:54,371
LAURA: And I'm going to run as fast as I can over
to where I can see them hoarding the gold, because

1545
01:38:54,371 --> 01:38:55,349
I want to see it.

1546
01:38:55,349 --> 01:38:56,784
MATT: All right. You get over there pretty quick.

1547
01:38:56,784 --> 01:38:58,428
TALIESIN: I'm going to check the frozen body.

1548
01:38:58,428 --> 01:39:00,804
MATT: Okay. As Keyleth checks, you check the
frozen body.

1549
01:39:00,804 --> 01:39:03,342
TALIESIN: Is that the dead man?

1550
01:39:03,342 --> 01:39:09,771
MATT: Oh. oh! The frozen man. Okay. Keyleth. You
take a moment to cut through and there's the other

1551
01:39:09,771 --> 01:39:14,452
undamaged mandible, the eye appears to be
undamaged but those are all going to be very

1552
01:39:14,452 --> 01:39:21,066
careful, time-intensive things to remove properly.
There isn't much that can really be pulled from

1553
01:39:21,066 --> 01:39:25,518
this other than that. There's not a whole lot of
material on--

1554
01:39:25,518 --> 01:39:27,597
MARISHA: Can I vial any of the blood?

1555
01:39:27,597 --> 01:39:29,328
MATT: You can bottle some of the blood, yeah.

1556
01:39:29,328 --> 01:39:30,464
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to do that.

1557
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:31,717
MATT: Okay, so you bottle some of the blood--

1558
01:39:31,717 --> 01:39:33,547
MARISHA: And I'm going to take that mandible if I
can.

1559
01:39:33,547 --> 01:39:39,455
MATT: Okay, so you remove a mandible. So you can
mark that down. All right, so you guys are

1560
01:39:39,455 --> 01:39:41,132
gathering money.

1561
01:39:41,132 --> 01:39:44,986
TRAVIS: We don't have anything to store it in,
really.

1562
01:39:44,986 --> 01:39:50,050
LAURA: Can I try to get some of the icy armor off of
the big worm that's right next to me now?

1563
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:53,304
MATT: You step up to it. I mean, most of the
armor--

1564
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:55,137
LAURA: I just want to pull on it and see if I can
get some of it.

1565
01:39:55,137 --> 01:39:58,761
MATT: The parts that you pull on, that are like
big hefty chunks that would be of any real use, are

1566
01:39:58,761 --> 01:40:03,876
part of its body. The few that are busted from the
damage you dealt to it throughout the combat,

1567
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:07,589
they're such small pieces and they crumble at your
touch.

1568
01:40:07,589 --> 01:40:09,661
LAURA: It's okay, I'm more interested in gold
anyway.

1569
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:12,735
TALIESIN: Is it possible to move the frozen man,
or is he just really stuck in there?

1570
01:40:12,735 --> 01:40:17,227
MATT: You go ahead and you grab onto him, and he's
actually frozen to a coat of ice that is left in

1571
01:40:17,227 --> 01:40:21,971
there, and looking at the ice pattern, you get the
sensation that that frost worm may have frozen him

1572
01:40:21,971 --> 01:40:26,140
in there, had seen him previously and, unable to
reach him within the very back of that alcove,

1573
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:31,339
just frost breath-ed, this one or another like it
did so.

1574
01:40:31,339 --> 01:40:33,646
TALIESIN: Keyleth! Can I borrow you over here?

1575
01:40:33,646 --> 01:40:35,776
MARISHA: Yeah. What do you want?

1576
01:40:35,776 --> 01:40:37,832
SAM: Are your hands dripping with blood right
now?

1577
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:38,931
MARISHA: Yeah.

1578
01:40:38,931 --> 01:40:41,834
TALIESIN: Can you warm him up and see if we can
get him out of here?

1579
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:42,728
MARISHA: Yeah.

1580
01:40:42,728 --> 01:40:45,916
MATT: Okay, so you begin to slowly--

1581
01:40:45,916 --> 01:40:50,461
MARISHA: We were trying to do this before. We were
trying to melt his face because Pike was going to

1582
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,650
do a talk to dead spell.

1583
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:53,984
MATT: Okay.

1584
01:40:53,984 --> 01:40:55,861
TALIESIN: We know what happened to him now,
though.

1585
01:40:55,861 --> 01:40:57,558
LAURA: Yeah, we've got to get out of here.

1586
01:40:57,558 --> 01:41:00,784
MATT: So, anything else you want to do?

1587
01:41:00,784 --> 01:41:07,110
MARISHA: Well, I guess we're taking the body?
I'll focus my heat on his feet so we can just

1588
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:10,440
dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and
go.

1589
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:14,118
MATT: Okay. The ice slowly begins to melt, you
gather you probably have another five to ten

1590
01:41:14,118 --> 01:41:15,549
minutes before he'll be free.

1591
01:41:15,549 --> 01:41:16,880
TRAVIS: That's pretty long. Too long.

1592
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,697
LAURA: Yeah, if we feel anything, let's go, okay.
Got the gold? Let's go. Let's go.

1593
01:41:20,697 --> 01:41:25,557
MATT: You're still gathering gold, it's going to
take you a while to get all this, it's a lot of--

1594
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:27,166
it's a small opening--

1595
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:31,903
TRAVIS: Do we leave the cave or do we use the
teleportation circle?

1596
01:41:31,903 --> 01:41:33,009
LAURA: Teleportation circle.

1597
01:41:33,009 --> 01:41:35,000
MARISHA: How much time is it going to take them to
get the gold?

1598
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,637
MATT: Probably, to get all of it? Another probably
15 minutes or so.

1599
01:41:38,637 --> 01:41:39,783
LAURA: Jeez.

1600
01:41:39,783 --> 01:41:42,421
MATT: Because you have to like get in the cavern
and pull out chunks, so it's a big hoard.

1601
01:41:42,421 --> 01:41:45,729
MARISHA: How about this, let's spend five minutes
doing all this stuff and see where we're at.

1602
01:41:45,729 --> 01:41:48,061
LAURA: He's rolling, he's rolling!

1603
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,741
MARISHA: Son of a bitch, we should go.

1604
01:41:49,741 --> 01:41:53,155
MATT: As you're having this conversation, the
ground begins to quake and you can just see--

1605
01:41:53,155 --> 01:41:55,641
ALL: Go! Run run run!

1606
01:41:55,641 --> 01:41:59,292
SAM: It could be an unrelated seismic event.

1607
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:00,739
LAURA: Scanlan, run!

1608
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:06,153
MATT: All right, as you all rush around the
corpses, heading towards the teleportation circle, you--

1609
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:07,997
SAM: I smack myself with Bigby's Hand.

1610
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:12,286
MATT: Giving yourself a lift as you're pushed
along over the course, you guys rush over to the

1611
01:42:12,286 --> 01:42:16,240
teleportation circle, right as you hear the ground
erupt about 30 feet behind you.

1612
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:17,911
LAURA: Oh, shit!

1613
01:42:17,911 --> 01:42:21,563
MATT: In a very similar fashion as the initial
arrival of the worm, and you hear a similar

1614
01:42:21,563 --> 01:42:23,169
shrieking sound.

1615
01:42:23,169 --> 01:42:25,293
LAURA: Slow-motion turn around, is it a purple one
or a blue one?

1616
01:42:25,293 --> 01:42:29,770
MATT: It is another purple worm. A larger one.
Immediate comparison? You get the idea, and as you

1617
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:34,118
were tearing it apart-- Both of these were
adolescent. They weren't fully grown.

1618
01:42:34,118 --> 01:42:35,067
TALIESIN: Run!

1619
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:36,870
TRAVIS: Must go faster. Must go faster.

1620
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:41,668
MATT: All of you guys rush onto it, one after the
other, onto the teleportation sigil, the sigil

1621
01:42:41,668 --> 01:42:46,282
carrying each of you back to your destination
before the purple worm can reach you in time, you

1622
01:42:46,282 --> 01:42:53,468
all now find yourselves standing in the room
beneath the house that previously belonged to

1623
01:42:53,468 --> 01:42:59,864
Krieg, safe, with as much gold as you could carry
in the time period you had.

1624
01:42:59,864 --> 01:43:02,137
LAURA: Which is a good amount, I have a feeling.

1625
01:43:02,137 --> 01:43:04,350
MATT: We'll come back to that in a minute, but
first we're going to take a little break for the

1626
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:08,663
restroom, guys. So we'll see you back here real
fast, we'll make this a quick break, and see you soon.

1627
01:43:08,663 --> 01:43:10,492
TRAVIS: Five minutes. Five minutes. Don't leave.

1628
01:43:10,492 --> 01:43:11,846
MATT: Bye, guys.

1629
01:43:11,846 --> 01:58:24,258
[break]

1630
01:58:24,258 --> 01:58:31,254
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Returning, as
the party calms down after the harrowing encounter

1631
01:58:31,254 --> 01:58:37,603
with a couple of worm-based entities. What would
you like to do?

1632
01:58:37,603 --> 01:58:42,869
MARISHA: Sorry about that whole cloud mist thing,
you guys. I was trying to--

1633
01:58:42,869 --> 01:58:44,454
LAURA: We almost died.

1634
01:58:44,454 --> 01:58:46,743
MARISHA: Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks, Vex.

1635
01:58:46,743 --> 01:58:48,003
TRAVIS: That was you?

1636
01:58:48,003 --> 01:58:54,098
MARISHA: Look, it was something new, I'm still
working out the kinks, all right?

1637
01:58:54,098 --> 01:58:56,068
LAURA: Don't do it again. Not in combat.

1638
01:58:56,068 --> 01:59:02,892
MARISHA: I'm working out the kinks. I'm sorry.
It'll be really cool next time I try it.

1639
01:59:02,892 --> 01:59:08,676
LIAM: 20. Anything left? Or is it just where I,
we--

1640
01:59:08,676 --> 01:59:12,476
MATT: Same setup where you left it, but the same
pattern to escape that you recall from before.

1641
01:59:12,476 --> 01:59:14,742
LIAM: There were traps left still. Still the same,
all right.

1642
01:59:14,742 --> 01:59:20,536
MATT: Still the same pattern, so you guys all,
thankfully, due to Vax's viselike memory, follow

1643
01:59:20,536 --> 01:59:25,236
the path through the tiles to avoid the traps that
are set entering that room. You make your way back

1644
01:59:25,236 --> 01:59:34,751
up the stairs to the gallery room that contained
the tapestries, the domino set, the gold tea set,

1645
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:36,895
the skull with the gem, all those things.

1646
01:59:36,895 --> 01:59:43,683
TALIESIN: I say we grab the tea set and the skull
and take them to Lady--

1647
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:44,946
LAURA: Dr. Dra?

1648
01:59:44,946 --> 01:59:48,786
TALIESIN: No, actually, maybe we should have it
identified first.

1649
01:59:48,786 --> 01:59:53,847
LAURA: Right. That would be smart. What are we
going to get-- are we doing-- wait. Here's a

1650
01:59:53,847 --> 02:00:01,695
question I have. Do we have to give Dr. Dra the
portion of what we found down there? Because

1651
02:00:01,695 --> 02:00:06,686
technically it's not in the house. Technically.
So, whatever we find in the house is what we give

1652
02:00:06,686 --> 02:00:09,287
him a percentage of, yes? Yes?

1653
02:00:09,287 --> 02:00:13,030
SAM: Technically, he's not an honorable man. But
we should be.

1654
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:19,423
LAURA: Right, and honorably, it is truthful to say
that we didn't find it in the house. Technically,

1655
02:00:19,423 --> 02:00:21,876
it's across the fucking world.

1656
02:00:21,876 --> 02:00:25,196
TRAVIS: That's true. Give him a bit of the tea
set, we give him the dominoes--

1657
02:00:25,196 --> 02:00:29,007
LAURA: They tried to steal our money, Scanlan, and
you're letting them have free rein in our house

1658
02:00:29,007 --> 02:00:29,846
right now.

1659
02:00:29,846 --> 02:00:30,945
SAM: It's their nature.

1660
02:00:30,945 --> 02:00:34,431
MARISHA: I'm still really confused as to why we
came back here to begin with.

1661
02:00:34,431 --> 02:00:36,860
SAM: We were checking it out to see if it was
safe.

1662
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:39,676
MARISHA: Right, well, that's been confirmed, it's
not.

1663
02:00:39,676 --> 02:00:42,322
LAURA: Right? We found the owner of the house, and
he's been frozen.

1664
02:00:42,322 --> 02:00:46,536
SAM: Should we report this to the officials and
try to quarantine the house, destroy it,

1665
02:00:46,536 --> 02:00:47,408
something?

1666
02:00:47,408 --> 02:00:48,983
TALIESIN: I think that would be wise.

1667
02:00:48,983 --> 02:00:50,354
MARISHA: Quarantine the house?

1668
02:00:50,354 --> 02:00:53,361
SAM: Just destroy the portal, destroy the
teleportation circle.

1669
02:00:53,361 --> 02:00:55,797
TALIESIN: Certainly can't have anyone else moving
in here.

1670
02:00:55,797 --> 02:00:59,769
LAURA: We should take it for ourselves. Just to
keep it safe.

1671
02:00:59,769 --> 02:01:02,276
SAM: Take the gold, or the house?

1672
02:01:02,276 --> 02:01:03,574
TRAVIS and LAURA: The house.

1673
02:01:03,574 --> 02:01:07,467
LAURA: We should let Emperor Uriel know that we
should take control of this house because it

1674
02:01:07,467 --> 02:01:10,453
contains very powerful secrets.

1675
02:01:10,453 --> 02:01:12,562
TALIESIN: We should find out what that skull
does.

1676
02:01:12,562 --> 02:01:14,522
SAM: What does Pike think about that?

1677
02:01:14,522 --> 02:01:22,425
MATT: Pike? Hearing this conversation and still
glad that everyone survived this end of this whole

1678
02:01:22,425 --> 02:01:25,302
circumstance, goes: "Well--"

1679
02:01:25,302 --> 02:01:29,055
(laughter)

1680
02:01:29,055 --> 02:01:34,355
MATT: "I mean, we should let Uriel know."

1681
02:01:34,355 --> 02:01:36,823
TALIESIN: I can't look at him.

1682
02:01:36,823 --> 02:01:41,109
MATT: "But we also made a deal. And we're people
of our word."

1683
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:44,827
LAURA: Yes, Pike, we made a deal for anything we
found in the house.

1684
02:01:44,827 --> 02:01:47,072
SAM: Don't condescend to Pike.

1685
02:01:47,072 --> 02:01:51,250
LAURA: I'm not condescending Pike, I am
rationalizing this agreement.

1686
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:55,908
MARISHA: I'm still really confused as to why we
are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable

1687
02:01:55,908 --> 02:01:57,067
people.

1688
02:01:57,067 --> 02:01:58,850
SAM: Because we're better than that.

1689
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:00,776
LAURA: I'm going to tell him you said that.

1690
02:02:00,776 --> 02:02:02,915
TRAVIS: Yeah, why do we care if they have money?

1691
02:02:02,915 --> 02:02:08,877
SAM: Let's count our money first before we make
that decision. But I'm mainly concerned what Pike

1692
02:02:08,877 --> 02:02:11,517
feels about taking control of this evil, evil
house.

1693
02:02:11,517 --> 02:02:13,515
LAURA: It's not evil, evil. It's not an evil
house.

1694
02:02:13,515 --> 02:02:16,276
SAM: It's got an evil, mysterious gem-eye looking
at us right now.

1695
02:02:16,276 --> 02:02:23,862
LAURA: Well, exactly, it's got secrets. We have a
house that has powerful secrets in it, that people

1696
02:02:23,862 --> 02:02:29,957
shouldn't be in. I'm saying we should claim it so
that we can keep other people from falling

1697
02:02:29,957 --> 02:02:30,811
victim.

1698
02:02:30,811 --> 02:02:37,347
SAM: All right. If in claiming it we can get
someone, some sort of religious person in here to

1699
02:02:37,347 --> 02:02:42,947
clear it for us, making sure that it's-- Pike
would be an option.

1700
02:02:42,947 --> 02:02:48,332
MARISHA: How is this going to sound to Uriel?
Excuse me, Uriel, just want to let you know that

1701
02:02:48,332 --> 02:02:53,892
we broke into General Krieg's old house and found
out it's really dangerous. Can we have it?

1702
02:02:53,892 --> 02:02:57,751
LAURA: No, we just say-- Keyleth, really?

1703
02:02:57,751 --> 02:02:59,308
MARISHA: Well, I'm just saying, how do we phrase
this?

1704
02:02:59,308 --> 02:03:03,095
LAURA: You think that's how you would phrase it?
You'd say: we heard rumor that the owner of the

1705
02:03:03,095 --> 02:03:08,213
house had gone missing. We went to investigate and
discovered very powerful, dangerous secrets

1706
02:03:08,213 --> 02:03:14,250
within. We know where he is. He's frozen on the
other side of a portal. We need to make sure

1707
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:19,911
nobody else falls victim to it. So we close off
the house and we say we'll keep it safe. For the

1708
02:03:19,911 --> 02:03:21,049
time being.

1709
02:03:21,049 --> 02:03:23,288
MARISHA: And what happens when he asks why we were
there in the first place?

1710
02:03:23,288 --> 02:03:26,992
LAURA: We tell him we <i>heard</i> that somebody went
missing and we were investigating where he went.

1711
02:03:26,992 --> 02:03:28,322
TRAVIS: That makes sense to me.

1712
02:03:28,322 --> 02:03:30,387
LIAM: We've probably earned a bit of trust at this
point.

1713
02:03:30,387 --> 02:03:34,331
LAURA: What, we have to go through his guard? No.
We're part of the council.

1714
02:03:34,331 --> 02:03:37,155
MARISHA: I don't know

1715
02:03:37,155 --> 02:03:39,223
LAURA: I think it's a very fair-- Percy?

1716
02:03:39,223 --> 02:03:44,315
TALIESIN: I would agree. I don't think it's
necessary for us to claim ownership for it. We

1717
02:03:44,315 --> 02:03:47,768
just need to have it cordoned off and make sure no
one else, other than us, can come in.

1718
02:03:47,768 --> 02:03:51,438
LAURA: Exactly. I'm not saying it's ours. I'm
saying we just make sure no else comes in.

1719
02:03:51,438 --> 02:03:53,931
SAM: We're leasing with an option to buy.

1720
02:03:53,931 --> 02:03:56,241
TRAVIS: Is the skull with the gem in there still?

1721
02:03:56,241 --> 02:03:58,715
MATT: It's still turned away, and I believe you
put a tapestry over it.

1722
02:03:58,715 --> 02:04:00,251
LAURA: Yes, we did.

1723
02:04:00,251 --> 02:04:01,906
TALIESIN: Let's bundle it up in the tapestry.

1724
02:04:01,906 --> 02:04:03,914
LIAM: That thing is trouble, though, that thing is
trouble

1725
02:04:03,914 --> 02:04:05,421
TALIESIN: Well, let's take it to somebody who--

1726
02:04:05,421 --> 02:04:06,722
SAM: Take the skull?

1727
02:04:06,722 --> 02:04:09,842
TALIESIN: I think we should take the skull and
show it to someone who might know what it is.

1728
02:04:09,842 --> 02:04:13,908
TRAVIS: All right, I go over and grab the tapestry
and the skull, hold it like a knapsack.

1729
02:04:13,908 --> 02:04:17,281
MATT: Okay, make-- no this is fine, it's
relatively light.

1730
02:04:17,281 --> 02:04:19,404
TRAVIS: Can you hear me?

1731
02:04:19,404 --> 02:04:23,403
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog, we can hear you.

1732
02:04:23,403 --> 02:04:27,557
TRAVIS: Yeah. Right, good, maybe--

1733
02:04:27,557 --> 02:04:38,996
SAM: Oh shit, the whispers. If you haven't read
the comics, check it out on geekandsundry.com.

1734
02:04:38,996 --> 02:04:43,591
TALIESIN: And while you're there, spend some money
at Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Gilmore's, where all

1735
02:04:43,591 --> 02:04:48,492
of your magical items can be procured. With a
smile a week.

1736
02:04:48,492 --> 02:04:50,576
LAURA: (laughing) That was the lamest slogan
ever.

1737
02:04:50,576 --> 02:04:52,380
MARISHA: All of your items can be purchased.

1738
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,611
TALIESIN: I'm exhausted.

1739
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:56,200
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up! Wait, wait, wait. Last
part, last part, last part.

1740
02:04:56,200 --> 02:05:01,689
SAM: And don't forget!

1741
02:05:01,723 --> 02:05:05,399
TALIESIN: Don't forget?

1742
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:09,971
SAM: If someone's whispering in your ear, it's
probably the sound of your conscience saying:

1743
02:05:09,971 --> 02:05:11,423
"Go buy a T-shirt!"

1744
02:05:11,423 --> 02:05:14,761
TRAVIS: I take off running out of the house.

1745
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:20,668
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Grog just bolts out of the house. Just runs up the

1746
02:05:20,668 --> 02:05:23,999
stairs, out through the foyer, and is--

1747
02:05:23,999 --> 02:05:25,278
LAURA and TALIESIN: Grog!

1748
02:05:25,278 --> 02:05:26,930
LIAM: I start running after him, and I'm hasted.

1749
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:28,917
MARISHA: Oh, it's reverse whispering!

1750
02:05:28,917 --> 02:05:31,163
TALIESIN: It's the reverse whisper!

1751
02:05:31,163 --> 02:05:33,017
SAM: Guys, this is the rest of the show.

1752
02:05:33,017 --> 02:05:37,268
TALIESIN: They're not talking, there's just
tongues in ears.

1753
02:05:37,268 --> 02:05:39,234
LAURA: (laughs) Lalalala.

1754
02:05:39,234 --> 02:05:41,611
MARISHA: Wet willie.

1755
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:44,415
LIAM: I'm running out stealthing, after him.

1756
02:05:44,415 --> 02:05:48,597
LAURA: I stop and I get the golden tea set. And I
take off after him.

1757
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:50,494
TRAVIS: (yelling) Guys, you've got to come out of
the house, now!

1758
02:05:50,494 --> 02:05:51,944
TALIESIN: Okay, we're running out of the house.

1759
02:05:51,944 --> 02:05:53,658
TRAVIS: We've got to get out of the house. Now!

1760
02:05:53,658 --> 02:05:55,129
TALIESIN: We're running out of the house.

1761
02:05:55,129 --> 02:05:57,072
MARISHA: Okay, okay. We're running out of the
house. Christ.

1762
02:05:57,072 --> 02:05:59,550
TALIESIN: I'm following him out of the house, so.

1763
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:03,890
MATT: Right. You all rush out. You're now out of
the foyer. You burst out the front of the home

1764
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:07,705
itself. You're in the front yard at this point in
time, in the slightly dead grass.

1765
02:06:07,705 --> 02:06:09,910
TALIESIN: It's going to go Poltergeist on us,
isn't it?

1766
02:06:09,910 --> 02:06:12,083
MARISHA: The house just collapses.

1767
02:06:12,083 --> 02:06:15,535
MATT: The sun's still high in the sky, late
afternoon at this point.

1768
02:06:15,535 --> 02:06:16,686
LAURA: What the fuck was that about?

1769
02:06:16,686 --> 02:06:22,620
TRAVIS: The house and the skull are linked. As
long as the house stands, his evil will grow.

1770
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:23,987
SAM: Whose evil?

1771
02:06:23,987 --> 02:06:28,564
TRAVIS: It didn't say. The house has to be taken
down to the ground. The portal must be destroyed.

1772
02:06:28,564 --> 02:06:30,349
LIAM: Says who? Who's in there?

1773
02:06:30,349 --> 02:06:37,550
TRAVIS: (loud and angry) I just heard this
fucking-- (calmer, hesitating) I. Have...

1774
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:40,851
premonitions at times, it runs in my family.

1775
02:06:40,851 --> 02:06:42,462
MARISHA: Since when, Grog?

1776
02:06:42,462 --> 02:06:47,535
TRAVIS: You know, when I'm drinking ale, this
voice goes like: "Stop!" But I'm like: "No." And I

1777
02:06:47,535 --> 02:06:50,257
keep going. And sure enough, I should've stopped.

1778
02:06:50,257 --> 02:06:51,884
MARISHA: But you haven't been drinking today.

1779
02:06:51,884 --> 02:06:53,587
SAM: That voice is usually me.

1780
02:06:53,587 --> 02:06:56,376
TRAVIS: Are you saying anything?

1781
02:06:56,376 --> 02:07:00,968
MATT: Grog. Make a deception check.

1782
02:07:00,968 --> 02:07:04,275
TRAVIS: 12.

1783
02:07:04,275 --> 02:07:11,637
MATT: I'm going to say, over the course of
everyone listening, Grog hasn't been really fancy

1784
02:07:11,637 --> 02:07:17,963
with wordplay or deception. He's a very blunt,
upfront person, and it's very awkward to see a

1785
02:07:17,963 --> 02:07:25,290
childlike mind attempt to convey a fictional story
like the one he's been pretending.

1786
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:26,810
LAURA: So, you're lying.

1787
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:28,066
TRAVIS: What?

1788
02:07:28,066 --> 02:07:29,510
LAURA: You're lying, Grog.

1789
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:31,149
TRAVIS: What? Why do you say that?

1790
02:07:31,149 --> 02:07:34,268
TALIESIN: Because you're really bad at it. And
it's hilarious.

1791
02:07:34,268 --> 02:07:37,527
TRAVIS: Reverse psychology. I'm really bad at it.

1792
02:07:37,527 --> 02:07:38,897
LAURA: Yes, you are.

1793
02:07:38,897 --> 02:07:40,305
TRAVIS: That didn't work.

1794
02:07:40,305 --> 02:07:41,388
TALIESIN: No, it didn't.

1795
02:07:41,388 --> 02:07:46,353
LIAM: I want to walk right up to Grog. Right up to
his nipples, because that's as high as I go.

1796
02:07:46,353 --> 02:07:48,424
SAM: Kiss him on the mouth.

1797
02:07:48,424 --> 02:07:49,519
(laughter)

1798
02:07:49,519 --> 02:07:56,750
LIAM: That's two episodes from today. Will you
come down here, please? Big Man? Couple of things.

1799
02:07:56,750 --> 02:08:05,502
First, and this is a smaller detail, I shaved half
your beard, correct? It's correct. You've cut me

1800
02:08:05,502 --> 02:08:09,351
open at least twice, right now. Pike, come here.

1801
02:08:09,351 --> 02:08:11,289
MATT: Pike walks up. "Yeah?"

1802
02:08:11,289 --> 02:08:19,751
LIAM: I would say that makes you and I even.
You've been acting all kinds of fucked-up for a

1803
02:08:19,751 --> 02:08:25,978
while now, and I know you don't want to disappoint
her, your best friend. Something's going on with

1804
02:08:25,978 --> 02:08:30,962
you, and it's time to talk about it. You're
talking to yourself, you're talking to your own

1805
02:08:30,962 --> 02:08:34,629
asshole. You're talking to that fucking sword,
you're talking to trinkets we're picking up in

1806
02:08:34,629 --> 02:08:36,460
houses. What is going on?

1807
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:37,748
TRAVIS: Talking to the sword?

1808
02:08:37,748 --> 02:08:42,069
LIAM: And she's listening. And she knows when
you're lying, and she knows when you're telling

1809
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,969
the truth.

1810
02:08:42,969 --> 02:08:43,860
TRAVIS: Pike?

1811
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:49,684
MATT: She does give you this concerned look that
only a possibly disappointed friend can give you,

1812
02:08:49,684 --> 02:08:52,416
like, "I am worried about you, Grog."

1813
02:08:52,416 --> 02:09:04,509
TRAVIS: Honestly, I'm hurt. I'm offended. And we
are not fucking equal. If you want to get equal,

1814
02:09:04,509 --> 02:09:09,335
we can step out here, and handle business like
men.

1815
02:09:09,335 --> 02:09:13,282
MARISHA: Who all is around to see this?

1816
02:09:13,282 --> 02:09:15,910
TRAVIS: I've cut you open twice. Twice.

1817
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:18,688
LIAM: I walk away. I walk off. I leave the fucking
house.

1818
02:09:18,688 --> 02:09:21,321
LAURA: We're already out of the house.

1819
02:09:21,321 --> 02:09:24,801
MATT: So as you guys are standing in front of the
house, Vax just steps out into the center of the

1820
02:09:24,801 --> 02:09:27,010
Cloudtop District, in the direction towards the
exit.

1821
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:29,213
LIAM: Gone. Stealthed. Laters.

1822
02:09:29,213 --> 02:09:32,397
TRAVIS: Pike, can I talk to you for a second?

1823
02:09:32,397 --> 02:09:34,835
MATT: "Yeah. Grog, anything."

1824
02:09:34,835 --> 02:09:41,204
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Talking to my sword. The skull
has a voice.

1825
02:09:41,204 --> 02:09:44,587
MATT: "What do you mean?"

1826
02:09:44,587 --> 02:09:50,668
TRAVIS: Yeah. I picked it up, right, because I was
just going to carry it out, and it said, like: "I

1827
02:09:50,668 --> 02:09:54,432
"can grant you a wish. Any wish that you want."

1828
02:09:54,432 --> 02:10:04,044
MATT: "We've been told something similar before,
and that didn't go too well. Put the skull down, please."

1829
02:10:04,044 --> 02:10:08,967
TRAVIS: Yeah. But it's a wish. We can wish for
anything.

1830
02:10:08,967 --> 02:10:11,916
MATT: "Grog, please, trust me? Put the skull
down."

1831
02:10:11,916 --> 02:10:15,212
TRAVIS: I don't want to put it down.

1832
02:10:15,212 --> 02:10:18,179
MATT: "I know. Do you trust me?"

1833
02:10:18,179 --> 02:10:20,498
TRAVIS: Yes.

1834
02:10:20,498 --> 02:10:26,370
MATT: "Put the skull down, Grog."

1835
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:28,277
TRAVIS: I drop the skull.

1836
02:10:28,277 --> 02:10:32,740
MATT: Okay. The tapestry clatters to the ground
and opens up, and the skull rolls for a second and

1837
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:37,735
stops on its side. You can see now, the golden
skull is just resting there. The gem still with

1838
02:10:37,735 --> 02:10:45,657
the intricate filigree, buried within the eye
socket. Pike turns to the rest of you and calls

1839
02:10:45,657 --> 02:10:56,371
you over. "We don't know what this is. And
dangerous magics are drawn to imagery like this.

1840
02:10:56,371 --> 02:10:59,656
"Let us see what this is about, first."

1841
02:10:59,656 --> 02:11:05,984
MARISHA: Pike, can you discern what kind of entity
this might be attached to?

1842
02:11:05,984 --> 02:11:12,210
MATT: "I had a feeling before." And she pulls out
her healing symbol and casts Detect Good or Evil

1843
02:11:12,210 --> 02:11:19,472
again in the direction of the skull. You can see
she recoils the moment that she concentrates. "The

1844
02:11:19,472 --> 02:11:21,659
"aura is definitely evil from this object."

1845
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:23,084
MARISHA: Okay.

1846
02:11:23,084 --> 02:11:25,223
LAURA: Maybe it was lying to you.

1847
02:11:25,223 --> 02:11:26,414
SAM: What?

1848
02:11:26,414 --> 02:11:31,476
TRAVIS: Lying? I hadn't thought of that.

1849
02:11:31,476 --> 02:11:35,912
MARISHA: Is that all you have, Pike? That's all
you can find out?

1850
02:11:35,912 --> 02:11:39,008
MATT: "You have to take it to somebody who knows
it or spend some time with it, perhaps."

1851
02:11:39,008 --> 02:11:44,745
LAURA: How about this, how about nobody ask the
skull any more questions?

1852
02:11:44,745 --> 02:11:47,439
MARISHA: Yeah, no one touch the-- Is it just
laying on the floor right now?

1853
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:49,160
MATT: Just laying right there, off to the side.

1854
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,820
SAM: Put it in the Bag of Holding?

1855
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:51,788
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

1856
02:11:51,788 --> 02:11:57,189
LAURA: I don't like evil things in the Bag of
Holding. We have lots of weird things in there, I

1857
02:11:57,189 --> 02:11:58,509
don't know how it'll react.

1858
02:11:58,509 --> 02:12:01,916
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out my sword and pick
it up by the eye socket.

1859
02:12:01,916 --> 02:12:04,835
MATT: The empty one? Okay. You lift it up.

1860
02:12:04,835 --> 02:12:07,858
TALIESIN: I'm going to carry it on a stick.

1861
02:12:07,858 --> 02:12:10,141
LAURA: Should we put a cloth over it?

1862
02:12:10,141 --> 02:12:11,610
SAM: Yeah, that might look a little weird.

1863
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:14,669
TALIESIN: It's going to look weird with a cloth
over it, but please, go ahead.

1864
02:12:14,669 --> 02:12:23,750
MATT: Okay. Vex, as you approach it and go to
throw the cloth over it, you get a brief view of

1865
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:28,454
the gem that's in the socket. And where there was
a slight shimmer to its surface when it was

1866
02:12:28,454 --> 02:12:35,801
looking to before, you can now see briefly what
looks like some sort of a ghostly face appears

1867
02:12:35,801 --> 02:12:38,175
across the surface for a second and then fades.

1868
02:12:38,175 --> 02:12:39,477
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1869
02:12:39,477 --> 02:12:40,865
MATT: You throw it over it.

1870
02:12:40,865 --> 02:12:43,083
LAURA: That thing's alive. That is definitely
alive.

1871
02:12:43,083 --> 02:12:44,161
TRAVIS: What, the skull?

1872
02:12:44,161 --> 02:12:47,955
LAURA: No, no, no. There's definitely something in
that stone. It looked at me.

1873
02:12:47,955 --> 02:12:50,126
SAM: Well, that's creepy.

1874
02:12:50,126 --> 02:12:57,088
Can we take it to someone; who do we know?
Not Gilmore, this is beyond--

1875
02:12:57,088 --> 02:12:58,966
LAURA: Allura? She's not here, she's--

1876
02:12:58,966 --> 02:13:00,585
MATT: Allura's in Whitestone right now.

1877
02:13:00,585 --> 02:13:05,947
SAM: If only we had some way to magically
transport to Whitestone.

1878
02:13:05,947 --> 02:13:10,296
TALIESIN: We do actually have a way of magically
transporting to Whitestone.

1879
02:13:10,296 --> 02:13:12,394
SAM: Yes. We do. Could you go?

1880
02:13:12,394 --> 02:13:13,885
LAURA: Oh. Just one of us though.

1881
02:13:13,885 --> 02:13:15,107
SAM: Yes, you.

1882
02:13:15,107 --> 02:13:16,713
LAURA: Can you transport items with it?

1883
02:13:16,713 --> 02:13:18,752
TALIESIN: As long as they're on you, as long as
you're holding them.

1884
02:13:18,752 --> 02:13:24,246
MARISHA: But Percy, to be fair, you've had a bit
of a weakness with, you know, evil entities being

1885
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:25,435
attached to you.

1886
02:13:25,435 --> 02:13:28,075
TRAVIS: Yeah. Besides, if it grants a wish. I get
the fucking wish.

1887
02:13:28,075 --> 02:13:30,403
LAURA: You get the wish, Grog, you sure get the
wish.

1888
02:13:30,403 --> 02:13:32,816
MARISHA: No, it's not going to-- It's not granting
anyone's wish.

1889
02:13:32,816 --> 02:13:34,462
SAM: We could send Pike with it?

1890
02:13:34,462 --> 02:13:41,472
MARISHA: I mean, if want to sleep a day, we can
all just bamf back. We can tree stride back to

1891
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:43,711
Whitestone, if we want to take a nap.

1892
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:45,402
LAURA: That's true.

1893
02:13:45,402 --> 02:13:48,243
SAM: Wait, we're going to sleep with this skull in
our house?

1894
02:13:48,243 --> 02:13:54,010
MARISHA: Well, I've already spent my one 6th-level
spell turning us into fucking clouds.

1895
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:58,250
SAM: You didn't turn me into a cloud.

1896
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:59,424
LAURA: Or me.

1897
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:00,589
MARISHA: Yeah.

1898
02:14:00,589 --> 02:14:03,478
Honestly, if I would've turned everyone into
a cloud--

1899
02:14:03,478 --> 02:14:13,787
TALIESIN: We'll keep it locked in my workshop for
now. We can make it a night. And we will make sure

1900
02:14:13,787 --> 02:14:16,678
that they know we have to deal with the house.

1901
02:14:16,678 --> 02:14:18,090
LAURA: Okay.

1902
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:19,463
MARISHA: Who has to deal with the house?

1903
02:14:19,463 --> 02:14:22,709
LAURA: I'm going to go speak to Uriel and see if I
can tell him what just happened.

1904
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:24,158
SAM: You by yourself?

1905
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:28,138
LAURA: You can all come with me.

1906
02:14:28,138 --> 02:14:29,447
SAM: All right.

1907
02:14:29,447 --> 02:14:31,529
TALIESIN: I'll actually-- I've got a great idea.

1908
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:33,650
SAM: Oh. We'll leave the skull with Uriel.

1909
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:36,530
TALIESIN: I'll take the skull to Whitestone, and
I'll see you in the morning.

1910
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:37,491
LAURA: No.

1911
02:14:37,491 --> 02:14:39,616
SAM: After you've been corrupted by it?

1912
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,493
LAURA: How about we all go together to
Whitestone?

1913
02:14:41,493 --> 02:14:44,006
TALIESIN: I was just thinking it'll be a way of
getting the skull out of the house tonight.

1914
02:14:44,006 --> 02:14:46,188
LAURA: Yeah, but then it'll be in Whitestone.

1915
02:14:46,188 --> 02:14:48,731
SAM: We'll leave the skull in this house--

1916
02:14:48,731 --> 02:14:52,134
TALIESIN: That's a very fair point. We're not
leaving-- I don't think that's a good idea.

1917
02:14:52,134 --> 02:14:53,482
LAURA: No.

1918
02:14:53,482 --> 02:14:56,283
MARISHA: What, hang on, Grog. You were--

1919
02:14:56,283 --> 02:14:58,398
LAURA: Why did you run the skull out of the
house?

1920
02:14:58,398 --> 02:14:59,977
MARISHA: Yes. Exactly.

1921
02:14:59,977 --> 02:15:03,299
TRAVIS: I told you. The house is evil. The portal
has to be crushed.

1922
02:15:03,299 --> 02:15:04,812
SAM: Wait, that part's true?

1923
02:15:04,812 --> 02:15:06,317
MARISHA: The portal has to be crushed?

1924
02:15:06,317 --> 02:15:08,503
TRAVIS: It's an evil portal. Yeah.

1925
02:15:08,503 --> 02:15:10,121
SAM: Who told you that?

1926
02:15:10,121 --> 02:15:11,319
TRAVIS: The skull did.

1927
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:13,929
SAM: Oh, in addition to the wish? Oh.

1928
02:15:13,929 --> 02:15:19,082
LAURA: I don't know. Maybe the skull was trapped
in the house. Maybe it wanted to get out of the house.

1929
02:15:19,082 --> 02:15:20,631
SAM: It's like a genie.

1930
02:15:20,631 --> 02:15:25,833
TRAVIS: Don't look at me. I'm just the
translator.

1931
02:15:25,833 --> 02:15:27,727
SAM: Oh, this is weird. We need some help on
this.

1932
02:15:27,727 --> 02:15:30,121
MARISHA: Why was it talking through you, Grog? Why
not Pike?

1933
02:15:30,121 --> 02:15:34,300
TALIESIN: I think we'll get answers from Allura.

1934
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:40,944
MARISHA: If you can ask it questions, maybe we could
ask it a few more questions?

1935
02:15:40,944 --> 02:15:42,667
TRAVIS: I'm okay with that.

1936
02:15:42,667 --> 02:15:45,748
SAM: No. It will hypnotize us and corrupt us.

1937
02:15:45,748 --> 02:15:48,259
TRAVIS: It's in a knapsack.

1938
02:15:48,259 --> 02:15:51,419
LAURA: I think we should hide it and then open it
up when we're in front of Allura.

1939
02:15:51,419 --> 02:15:53,056
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1940
02:15:53,056 --> 02:15:55,203
MARISHA: What time is it?

1941
02:15:55,203 --> 02:15:59,295
MATT: Right now, it's mid-afternoon. Two, three
o'clock in the afternoon.

1942
02:15:59,295 --> 02:16:02,052
TALIESIN: Let's let Uriel know what's happened.

1943
02:16:02,052 --> 02:16:04,126
SAM: We'll go on a quick pub crawl.

1944
02:16:04,126 --> 02:16:07,954
TALIESIN: I've got to get home and work on a few
things, anyway. I've got a broken gun.

1945
02:16:07,954 --> 02:16:16,204
MARISHA: I guess I'll go with Percy and take the
skull, and I'll make sure we put it somewhere safe

1946
02:16:16,204 --> 02:16:20,034
in the keep, if you guys want to go talk to
Uriel.

1947
02:16:20,034 --> 02:16:23,907
LAURA: Pike? Grog? What do you guys want to do?

1948
02:16:23,907 --> 02:16:26,285
TRAVIS: What do we want to do, Pike?

1949
02:16:26,285 --> 02:16:29,102
MATT: "I don't know. We wanted to go talk to
Uriel."

1950
02:16:29,102 --> 02:16:35,500
MARISHA: Do you want to come with us, Pike? Do you
want to be with the skull, Pike, or do you want to

1951
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,172
go talk to Uriel?

1952
02:16:37,172 --> 02:16:38,710
MATT: "I should walk with you with the skull."

1953
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:40,765
TALIESIN: Yes, I think that would be best.

1954
02:16:40,765 --> 02:16:44,201
SAM: Before we all part ways, can we do a quick
accounting of the gold?

1955
02:16:44,201 --> 02:16:46,561
LAURA: We can't just count it right here.

1956
02:16:46,561 --> 02:16:49,430
TALIESIN: We'll count it back when we're--

1957
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:53,678
LAURA: Away from your friends, but back at the
keep.

1958
02:16:53,678 --> 02:16:56,732
SAM: All right. Fair enough.

1959
02:16:56,732 --> 02:17:02,075
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys make your way back to
Greyskull Keep with the skull, keeping it properly

1960
02:17:02,075 --> 02:17:08,947
covered so you're not walking through the city
with a giant gold skull at the end of a sword. You

1961
02:17:08,947 --> 02:17:13,900
head towards the palace. You make your way through
the front to the outer doors. The throne room is

1962
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:20,497
currently closed, and there is heavy guard up, and
upon you approaching, "I'm sorry. Do you have

1963
02:17:20,497 --> 02:17:22,183
"business with Uriel?"

1964
02:17:22,183 --> 02:17:23,960
LAURA: Not at the moment.

1965
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,147
MATT: "All right."

1966
02:17:25,147 --> 02:17:29,355
LAURA: But we will, once you tell him that we're
here.

1967
02:17:29,355 --> 02:17:36,268
MATT: "All right. Hold on." He steps inside. The
doors close. About two minutes pass. The guard

1968
02:17:36,268 --> 02:17:42,231
comes back out. "I'm terribly sorry. Uriel
currently is in a very heated discussion and

1969
02:17:42,231 --> 02:17:46,759
"cannot take guests at the moment. Would you like
me to relay a message?"

1970
02:17:46,759 --> 02:17:50,060
SAM: Yes.

1971
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:55,139
LAURA: Yes, but we would like to write it down
first.

1972
02:17:55,139 --> 02:18:06,038
SAM: Actually, while you were gone-- And I cast
Friends on him. While you were gone, other guards

1973
02:18:06,038 --> 02:18:08,991
came by and said we were clear to go in.

1974
02:18:08,991 --> 02:18:17,707
MATT: You can go ahead and make a deception check
with advantage.

1975
02:18:17,707 --> 02:18:19,418
SAM: Natural 20.

1976
02:18:19,418 --> 02:18:30,989
MATT: He goes, "Other guards? Uriel himself just
told me I can't let anyone inside."

1977
02:18:30,989 --> 02:18:35,626
LAURA: Oh, they must have seen him right after you
saw him.

1978
02:18:35,626 --> 02:18:43,779
MATT: "All right, fine." And he opens the door.
You guys walk in, and there you see the entirety

1979
02:18:43,779 --> 02:18:49,589
of the rest of the Council of Tal'Dorei. You see
Tofur Brotorus, you see Seeker Asum, you see--

1980
02:18:49,589 --> 02:19:01,662
what the hell is his name? The other guy. Arbiter
Brom. They're all gathered in this discussion.

1981
02:19:01,662 --> 02:19:04,700
Uriel looks up immediately and says, "I'm sorry,
we're not taking any--"

1982
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:07,360
LAURA: We heard there was a council meeting.

1983
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:10,259
MATT: "Technically, no, but yes, what is your
business?"

1984
02:19:10,259 --> 02:19:13,329
LAURA: We're here because there's a council
thing?

1985
02:19:13,329 --> 02:19:18,283
SAM: We're here to report a security concern of
the utmost importance and urgency to you.

1986
02:19:18,283 --> 02:19:26,593
MATT: There's a long, internalized sigh. Not out of
frustration, just more out of being lost in

1987
02:19:26,593 --> 02:19:30,256
thought and a little sad. He goes, "All right.
Very well."

1988
02:19:30,256 --> 02:19:32,170
LAURA: Is everything all right, Uriel?

1989
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:37,073
MATT: "Everything's fine. What would you like to
bring to the council?"

1990
02:19:37,073 --> 02:19:41,591
SAM: Are we among friends here and free to talk in
front of everyone?

1991
02:19:41,591 --> 02:19:48,087
MATT: He looks around. "These are my trusted
advisors and my trusted palace guard. Yes."

1992
02:19:48,087 --> 02:20:03,211
SAM: We've been alerted to some evil afoot in your
kingdom yet again. The former Krieg's homestead

1993
02:20:03,211 --> 02:20:11,713
has been vacant for a while and apparently has a
portal to an evil realm inside. We went to

1994
02:20:11,713 --> 02:20:14,258
investigate, acting on a tip from--

1995
02:20:14,258 --> 02:20:16,810
LAURA: An old friend.

1996
02:20:16,810 --> 02:20:18,243
SAM: Yes.

1997
02:20:18,243 --> 02:20:26,567
LAURA: And discovered that it was, in fact, true.
The owner that was missing has been killed.

1998
02:20:26,567 --> 02:20:33,972
MATT: "So, Krieg's estate, which was sold off
after his disappearance over a year ago, you're

1999
02:20:33,972 --> 02:20:36,745
"telling me contains some sort of evil portal."

2000
02:20:36,745 --> 02:20:37,716
LAURA: Yes.

2001
02:20:37,716 --> 02:20:39,164
MATT: "Was this built by the new owner?"

2002
02:20:39,164 --> 02:20:41,393
LAURA: No, I believe it was built by Krieg.

2003
02:20:41,393 --> 02:20:45,798
MATT: "Built by Krieg? How are you certain of this?"

2004
02:20:45,798 --> 02:20:49,923
SAM: Our informant told us as much. We don't want
to give his name.

2005
02:20:49,923 --> 02:20:53,053
LAURA: It seems rather old, this portal.

2006
02:20:53,053 --> 02:20:55,733
MATT: "Where is Krieg now?"

2007
02:20:55,733 --> 02:20:57,590
LAURA: I have no idea.

2008
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:03,943
MATT: "All right. Well, we'll send a security
force to keep a very close eye on the house while

2009
02:21:03,943 --> 02:21:05,732
"it is investigated."

2010
02:21:05,732 --> 02:21:09,980
SAM: It's extremely magically dangerous. They
should not set foot inside the place at all.

2011
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:14,516
LAURA: Incredibly dangerous. It might be best if
we investigate it ourselves.

2012
02:21:14,516 --> 02:21:19,389
MATT: "All right, if you'd like. I was going to
wait until Allura returned and I was going to

2013
02:21:19,389 --> 02:21:23,650
"assign her to it, but if you feel confident, then
I will leave the investigation in your hands."

2014
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:24,891
LAURA: Thank you.

2015
02:21:24,891 --> 02:21:27,062
SAM: Will you notify us when she returns?

2016
02:21:27,062 --> 02:21:28,135
MATT: "I will."

2017
02:21:28,135 --> 02:21:30,837
SAM: Is there anything else?

2018
02:21:30,837 --> 02:21:37,739
LAURA: No. You all look quite lovely today, and we
will leave you to your business.

2019
02:21:37,739 --> 02:21:46,108
MATT: Asum chuckles a little bit. The rest of them
acknowledge, Tofor gives a nod, and Uriel closes

2020
02:21:46,108 --> 02:21:52,224
his eyes for a second and rubs his temple and
goes, "I appreciate the information. If you

2021
02:21:52,224 --> 02:21:54,605
"please, we have matters to discuss."

2022
02:21:54,605 --> 02:22:02,934
SAM: Just real quick before we leave. I'm sorry. I
think I had a burrito. Can I just use a facility

2023
02:22:02,934 --> 02:22:06,483
inside? A restroom or something?

2024
02:22:06,483 --> 02:22:08,844
MATT: "Certainly."

2025
02:22:08,844 --> 02:22:10,395
SAM: Thank you.

2026
02:22:10,395 --> 02:22:13,371
LAURA: I'll wait for him.

2027
02:22:13,371 --> 02:22:16,882
SAM: Just wait out of earshot.

2028
02:22:16,882 --> 02:22:18,170
LAURA: Far away.

2029
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:26,007
MATT: "Thank you." They wait as you guys leave the
chambers. The guards close the doors, and you're

2030
02:22:26,007 --> 02:22:31,413
welcome to go. There are a number of various WCs,
water closets, throughout the palace.

2031
02:22:31,413 --> 02:22:32,827
LAURA: They closed the doors?

2032
02:22:32,827 --> 02:22:34,828
SAM: They closed the doors?

2033
02:22:34,828 --> 02:22:36,819
MATT: They're not going to let you crap in the
middle of the throne room!

2034
02:22:36,819 --> 02:22:40,506
LAURA: No, but I thought I could wait in the back
of the throne room, out of earshot.

2035
02:22:40,506 --> 02:22:46,505
MATT: The guards are pushing you out of the throne
room. This is a very private meeting.

2036
02:22:46,505 --> 02:22:48,670
LAURA: Excuse me, handsy. I'm leaving.

2037
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:51,644
MATT: "Sorry, Miss. Orders of Uriel." They push
you out and close the doors.

2038
02:22:51,644 --> 02:22:54,412
SAM: I've been in the throne room before?

2039
02:22:54,412 --> 02:22:55,967
MATT: You have been, yes.

2040
02:22:55,967 --> 02:22:58,028
SAM: Do you have eyes on them?

2041
02:22:58,028 --> 02:23:00,372
LAURA: No, they fucking shut me out.

2042
02:23:00,372 --> 02:23:05,799
SAM: All right. Give me ten minutes.

2043
02:23:05,799 --> 02:23:09,975
LIAM: Do you need a scroll?

2044
02:23:09,975 --> 02:23:13,840
SAM: I sit down on the WC.

2045
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,743
MATT: Do you take your potion?

2046
02:23:15,743 --> 02:23:24,467
SAM: No, I don't. Instead, I Polymorph into a
fly, and I'm going to fly my way to the throne room.

2047
02:23:24,467 --> 02:23:37,965
MATT: Okay. All right. You fly through, over to
the doors. The front doors?

2048
02:23:37,965 --> 02:23:40,627
SAM: Of the throne room?

2049
02:23:40,627 --> 02:23:42,063
MATT: How are you getting into the throne room?

2050
02:23:42,063 --> 02:23:43,352
SAM: The doors are closed, yes?

2051
02:23:43,352 --> 02:23:44,521
MATT: Yes.

2052
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:46,110
SAM: Is there any gap at all?

2053
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:47,451
MATT: There is a slight gap on the bottom.

2054
02:23:47,451 --> 02:23:49,775
SAM: Okay, I'm going to crawl in there.

2055
02:23:49,775 --> 02:23:55,586
MATT: As you come by, one of the guards swings at
you. You dodge out of the way without issue and

2056
02:23:55,586 --> 02:24:03,268
make your way underneath the doors and raise your
flight pattern.

2057
02:24:03,268 --> 02:24:06,520
LAURA: I start chatting up the guards on the
outside of the door to distract them a little bit.

2058
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:12,695
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw.

2059
02:24:12,695 --> 02:24:21,963
SAM: Dexterity? Oh, no, someone's got a fly
swatter! Ten?

2060
02:24:21,963 --> 02:24:30,584
MATT: Okay. As you cruise in for a moment, you can
see the throne room itself, in its round pattern,

2061
02:24:30,584 --> 02:24:36,589
has designs carved into the walls, almost like
Celtic knots. There are a number of these designs

2062
02:24:36,589 --> 02:24:40,429
right towards the sides of each entrance that
previously just looked like a design, but they

2063
02:24:40,429 --> 02:24:48,115
emit a dull glow for a second, and a burst of
arcane energy comes out from them. You find your

2064
02:24:48,115 --> 02:24:52,981
form immediately unfurl into that of Scanlan the
gnome, which then plops back onto the ground, your

2065
02:24:52,981 --> 02:24:58,578
Polymorph spell dispelled. All of a sudden, the
talk stops and the entire council turns back

2066
02:24:58,578 --> 02:25:01,289
towards the entrance as you're catching yourself on
the ground.

2067
02:25:01,289 --> 02:25:02,635
LIAM: Surprise!

2068
02:25:02,635 --> 02:25:11,426
SAM: That one's full. The one that I tried to go
into? It's full and it needs a big cleaning.

2069
02:25:11,426 --> 02:25:13,787
MATT: "Good to know, Scanlan."

2070
02:25:13,787 --> 02:25:16,171
SAM: I thought there was another one this way.

2071
02:25:16,171 --> 02:25:18,102
MATT: "There isn't, Scanlan."

2072
02:25:18,102 --> 02:25:26,407
SAM: Not through there, or anything? All right.
Carry on, then. You should send someone up to

2073
02:25:26,407 --> 02:25:29,235
service it, though, right away.

2074
02:25:29,235 --> 02:25:32,712
MATT: He looks over to Tofor, and Tofor goes--

2075
02:25:32,712 --> 02:25:34,967
SAM: It's a matter of security.

2076
02:25:34,967 --> 02:25:38,102
MATT: "We'll have it done. Thank you, Scanlan.
Now, please."

2077
02:25:38,102 --> 02:25:41,998
SAM: Okay. Two lefts and a right, and I'm out?
Thank you.

2078
02:25:41,998 --> 02:25:46,548
LIAM: Matt's got to be using Botox, because he
didn't move!

2079
02:25:46,548 --> 02:25:49,439
(laughter)

2080
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:57,021
MATT: Yeah, you gather, due to recent events, that
the magical defenses have been reinstated, with

2081
02:25:57,021 --> 02:26:03,628
the current circumstances. The doors open again,
and Vex, as you turn, you see Scanlan being led

2082
02:26:03,628 --> 02:26:04,830
out of the doors.

2083
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:06,854
LAURA: Scanlan, what are you doing here?

2084
02:26:06,854 --> 02:26:14,112
SAM: Shat all over my plans. Let's go home, I
guess.

2085
02:26:14,112 --> 02:26:21,963
MATT: All right. You guys make your way back to
Greyskull Keep. Vax is there, waiting.

2086
02:26:21,963 --> 02:26:23,622
LIAM: No, I'm not.

2087
02:26:23,622 --> 02:26:24,928
MATT: Oh, you didn't go back to the keep?

2088
02:26:24,928 --> 02:26:25,801
LIAM: Nope.

2089
02:26:25,801 --> 02:26:31,225
LAURA: I tell some guards on the way out just to
block off that house and not let anybody in it.

2090
02:26:31,225 --> 02:26:35,445
Don't go inside, on your life.

2091
02:26:35,445 --> 02:26:40,491
MATT: "Noted. The order just came through. Don't
worry. We're gathering a troop specifically for

2092
02:26:40,491 --> 02:26:42,053
"this. Don't worry."

2093
02:26:42,053 --> 02:26:45,654
LAURA: Not a lot of troops. Just a couple of dudes
is good.

2094
02:26:45,654 --> 02:26:47,213
MATT: "Very well."

2095
02:26:47,213 --> 02:26:48,547
LAURA: Okay.

2096
02:26:48,547 --> 02:26:52,500
MATT: As you're leaving, you can see there are a
few armed individuals, four, approximately, that

2097
02:26:52,500 --> 02:27:00,849
are moving towards the house to stand guard and
inspect the exterior, at the very least. You

2098
02:27:00,849 --> 02:27:06,092
return to Greyskull Keep. You guys get there, as
well. Grog, you return on your own, essentially,

2099
02:27:06,092 --> 02:27:13,182
at this point, unless you're walking with them
with the skull. Vax is nowhere to be found. You do

2100
02:27:13,182 --> 02:27:24,057
find that Dr. Dranzel, that whole team is gone,
except for Zed.

2101
02:27:24,057 --> 02:27:25,496
SAM: The drummer?

2102
02:27:25,496 --> 02:27:31,075
MATT: Yes. Zed is currently having a little bit of
ale in the dining room area, along with Jarett,

2103
02:27:31,075 --> 02:27:35,920
who was assigned to watch over while they're at
the keep. As you step inside, they all notice.

2104
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,845
Jarett, still with his crossbow loaded in his lap,
though he's happy and jovial and conversational

2105
02:27:39,845 --> 02:27:48,032
with Zed. "Ah, you've returned. Good to see all of
you in good health. The rest have left into the city."

2106
02:27:48,032 --> 02:27:51,059
SAM: Did they say why? For a performance?

2107
02:27:51,059 --> 02:28:00,579
MATT: Zed leans forward and goes, "Actually, it
appears that Kaylie got in some sort of a serious

2108
02:28:00,579 --> 02:28:06,015
"bar tussle last night and is currently being held
in the stocks. The stockade. I get those words

2109
02:28:06,015 --> 02:28:12,022
"confused. Stockade." He takes a sip of his ale.
"The rest of the troupe's going to see if they can

2110
02:28:12,022 --> 02:28:13,320
"get her out."

2111
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:16,097
SAM: All right, good to know. Thanks, Zed.

2112
02:28:16,097 --> 02:28:20,061
LAURA: Jarett?

2113
02:28:20,061 --> 02:28:21,854
MATT: "Yes?"

2114
02:28:21,854 --> 02:28:24,350
LAURA: Any issues while we were gone?

2115
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:30,097
MATT: "No issues, actually. They were good
conversationalists. They were very aware of my

2116
02:28:30,097 --> 02:28:35,408
"disposition, and I kept a very close eye on any
movement, preventing them from leaving the room

2117
02:28:35,408 --> 02:28:40,186
"unless they were as a group, except for their
exit, in which Zed escorted me. There have been no

2118
02:28:40,186 --> 02:28:41,195
"problems."

2119
02:28:41,195 --> 02:28:43,360
LAURA: Good man. I pat him on the shoulder.

2120
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:50,447
TRAVIS: She's in the stockade. Only problem is
getting caught. I like her style. Should we get

2121
02:28:50,447 --> 02:28:51,710
her out?

2122
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:59,315
SAM: I'd like to, very much, but I don't know how.
We can't just barge in there and break someone out

2123
02:28:59,315 --> 02:29:01,865
of jail. We're known people.

2124
02:29:01,865 --> 02:29:04,184
LAURA: Don't you have your sheriff badge?

2125
02:29:04,184 --> 02:29:06,895
LIAM: (laughs) Well-remembered.

2126
02:29:06,895 --> 02:29:09,329
TRAVIS: Yeah, can't we post a bond or something?

2127
02:29:09,329 --> 02:29:13,474
SAM: It's customs, not sheriff.

2128
02:29:13,474 --> 02:29:15,282
LAURA: Call the council.

2129
02:29:15,282 --> 02:29:19,830
MARISHA: Well, it sounds like they've already--
they're sending other people to get her out.

2130
02:29:19,830 --> 02:29:21,030
What's the big deal?

2131
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:23,025
SAM: Yeah, but they could make the problem worse.

2132
02:29:23,025 --> 02:29:25,032
LAURA: Those guys? They'll make it worse.

2133
02:29:25,032 --> 02:29:29,019
SAM: She's quite special to me. I think we
should-- I think <i>I</i> should go and try to get her out.

2134
02:29:29,019 --> 02:29:31,340
MARISHA: Oh, she's 'quite special' to you, yeah?

2135
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:34,075
TRAVIS: There's one place I haven't done it, and
it's in a prison.

2136
02:29:34,075 --> 02:29:36,587
SAM: Not, not in that way.

2137
02:29:36,587 --> 02:29:39,212
(laughter)

2138
02:29:39,212 --> 02:29:43,281
SAM: That's creepy. No, not in that way.

2139
02:29:43,281 --> 02:29:44,945
MARISHA: Why is that creepy?

2140
02:29:44,945 --> 02:29:48,097
SAM: I'm not interested in her in that way.

2141
02:29:48,097 --> 02:29:50,581
MARISHA: But you were courting her two days ago.

2142
02:29:50,581 --> 02:29:52,116
SAM: Things have changed.

2143
02:29:52,116 --> 02:29:53,309
MARISHA: I thought she spent the night in your
room.

2144
02:29:53,309 --> 02:29:59,936
SAM: She's a good person and she deserves much
better than the likes of me--

2145
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:01,809
TALIESIN: That's never stopped you before.

2146
02:30:01,809 --> 02:30:04,872
LAURA: Don't say that, Scanlan. You've got a
cube!

2147
02:30:04,872 --> 02:30:06,288
MARISHA: That's true.

2148
02:30:06,288 --> 02:30:15,554
SAM: It's a rather large cube, but, listen, all
right, she's-- she's-- we're related. We're

2149
02:30:15,554 --> 02:30:16,581
related.

2150
02:30:16,581 --> 02:30:17,447
MARISHA: What?

2151
02:30:17,447 --> 02:30:19,024
SAM: And I don't just mean--

2152
02:30:19,024 --> 02:30:20,377
MARISHA: Wait, what?

2153
02:30:20,377 --> 02:30:22,203
SAM: She's a Shorthalt.

2154
02:30:22,203 --> 02:30:24,647
TRAVIS: Like a cousin?

2155
02:30:24,647 --> 02:30:25,938
LAURA: Like a sister?

2156
02:30:25,938 --> 02:30:26,851
MARISHA: Like an aunt?

2157
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:28,116
TALIESIN: Like a mother?

2158
02:30:28,116 --> 02:30:31,523
SAM: Like a baby. Like a baby Shorthalt.

2159
02:30:31,523 --> 02:30:33,612
TRAVIS: Whose baby?

2160
02:30:33,612 --> 02:30:35,339
SAM: (high-pitched 'hee' sound)

2161
02:30:35,339 --> 02:30:36,517
TRAVIS: 'He'?

2162
02:30:36,517 --> 02:30:39,318
(laughter)

2163
02:30:39,318 --> 02:30:51,729
SAM: Listen, don't spread the word around. I don't
want my cred to be ruined, but... she's my little girl.

2164
02:30:51,729 --> 02:30:53,228
LAURA: You dog!

2165
02:30:53,228 --> 02:30:55,152
TRAVIS: You're a baby daddy?

2166
02:30:55,152 --> 02:30:59,413
SAM: I didn't know this, this is new information.
I'm still just adjusting to it.

2167
02:30:59,413 --> 02:31:01,583
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

2168
02:31:01,583 --> 02:31:04,520
MARISHA: You tried to sleep with your baby daddy?

2169
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:05,616
SAM: No I didn't.

2170
02:31:05,616 --> 02:31:07,310
TRAVIS: Did you lock that up that night?

2171
02:31:07,310 --> 02:31:11,464
SAM: No, I did not! I did not try and sleep with
her. I think deep down inside, some part of me

2172
02:31:11,464 --> 02:31:14,830
knew, which is why I gave her all that gold. I
think.

2173
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:16,205
TRAVIS: You paid her for it?

2174
02:31:16,205 --> 02:31:18,416
SAM: No! Oh, Grog, please!

2175
02:31:18,416 --> 02:31:20,264
(laughter)

2176
02:31:20,264 --> 02:31:27,891
SAM: I may deserve that but no, no. It's not like
that at all.

2177
02:31:27,891 --> 02:31:31,135
LAURA: Then you didn't know. There's no part of
you that knew you had any children.

2178
02:31:31,135 --> 02:31:37,845
SAM: I mean, I always knew that was a possibility,
in the trade I deal in.

2179
02:31:37,845 --> 02:31:41,100
MATT: At this point Zed breaks in and goes,
(chuckles) "Indeed!"

2180
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:46,279
SAM: All right. Easy. Listen, drummer--

2181
02:31:46,279 --> 02:31:48,628
MATT: "It's Zed."

2182
02:31:48,628 --> 02:31:57,050
SAM: You can be replaced easily. When I played with
them, we had seven drummers in two years. And I

2183
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:58,314
killed two of them.

2184
02:31:58,314 --> 02:32:00,791
(laughter)

2185
02:32:00,791 --> 02:32:04,937
MATT: He sets his drink down and pushes it away.
"Should I go?"

2186
02:32:04,937 --> 02:32:06,699
SAM: No, just stay and shut up.

2187
02:32:06,699 --> 02:32:08,337
TRAVIS: I'll take that, though. I take his drink.

2188
02:32:08,337 --> 02:32:12,091
MARISHA: Oh, wow. Well, that's--

2189
02:32:12,091 --> 02:32:17,871
SAM: Yes, I don't quite know how to act or behave
now. And I'm going through a crisis of conscience

2190
02:32:17,871 --> 02:32:23,618
and identity. I'm sorry; I'm off my game right
now. But she's related to me.

2191
02:32:23,618 --> 02:32:26,372
LAURA: Just make sure that she knows that you love
her. And make sure that she knows that you're

2192
02:32:26,372 --> 02:32:27,257
there for her.

2193
02:32:27,257 --> 02:32:30,592
MARISHA: Why do you keep saying she's 'related to'
you? Why don't you just call her exactly what she

2194
02:32:30,592 --> 02:32:32,418
is? Which is your daughter.

2195
02:32:32,418 --> 02:32:34,028
SAM: I don't know. Okay, all right.

2196
02:32:34,028 --> 02:32:36,579
MARISHA: That's weird to be like, 'my child is
related to me.'

2197
02:32:36,579 --> 02:32:41,149
SAM: I'm not good with this stuff. I haven't done
this before, all right? I haven't really had

2198
02:32:41,149 --> 02:32:46,178
family for much of my life. And this is a new
thing and it's going to take me some time to

2199
02:32:46,178 --> 02:32:51,757
adjust and figure out what this means for me. All
right? I've defined most of my life by the people

2200
02:32:51,757 --> 02:32:56,506
I've slept with and now, this a new part of me
that I have to figure out.

2201
02:32:56,506 --> 02:32:59,284
LAURA: Well, technically, it's still defined by--

2202
02:32:59,284 --> 02:33:02,855
TALIESIN: I was just thinking that. It's a
redefinition.

2203
02:33:02,855 --> 02:33:06,282
LAURA: You could make a really good move of it by
helping her get out of the stockade.

2204
02:33:06,282 --> 02:33:12,128
SAM: I would like to. But I'll need some help,
probably. I don't know if we can all go barge in there.

2205
02:33:12,128 --> 02:33:13,245
LAURA: Trinket.

2206
02:33:13,245 --> 02:33:15,268
MATT: (bear grunts)

2207
02:33:15,268 --> 02:33:17,129
LAURA: Scanlan needs help

2208
02:33:17,129 --> 02:33:23,685
MATT: Trinket lumbers over to you and (slurp).
Licks the side of your face. (bear groan) Leans

2209
02:33:23,685 --> 02:33:26,336
into you. Nearly pushing you off your feet from
the sheer mass.

2210
02:33:26,336 --> 02:33:38,341
SAM: (laughs) Thanks, Vex. Trinket, I'm okay for
right now. But maybe you can help best by staying

2211
02:33:38,341 --> 02:33:41,675
here and looking after the drummer here and making
sure.

2212
02:33:41,675 --> 02:33:53,150
MATT: (growls) Just growls at Zed, who stands up.
"I'm just here to make sure that we continue our

2213
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:56,707
"deal when they return. I'm not-- I don't-- I just
play the drums."

2214
02:33:56,707 --> 02:34:00,886
LAURA: You do a good job of it. Keep drinking that
ale.

2215
02:34:00,886 --> 02:34:02,353
TRAVIS: I give it back.

2216
02:34:02,353 --> 02:34:07,394
MATT: "I--" Takes the empty and goes and refills
it from a nearby cask.

2217
02:34:07,394 --> 02:34:11,491
SAM: I know it's late in the day, but I wouldn't
mind going right away. Does anyone want to join me?

2218
02:34:11,491 --> 02:34:14,532
TRAVIS: Do you want all of us? Or a smaller
party?

2219
02:34:14,532 --> 02:34:19,222
SAM: Probably just a smaller party. Don't we have
business to attend to here? Gold to count and--

2220
02:34:19,222 --> 02:34:21,119
LAURA: I can stay and count.

2221
02:34:21,119 --> 02:34:22,660
TRAVIS: I can stay with her.

2222
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:25,898
MARISHA: Who do you want to take? You pick your
dodgeball team.

2223
02:34:25,898 --> 02:34:26,974
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

2224
02:34:26,974 --> 02:34:28,191
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

2225
02:34:28,191 --> 02:34:29,377
TALIESIN: Yes.

2226
02:34:29,377 --> 02:34:36,468
SAM: Well to get out of a stockade, we'll need
some cunning. And cunning-- And cunning.

2227
02:34:36,468 --> 02:34:38,576
TRAVIS: Go ahead and ask.

2228
02:34:38,576 --> 02:34:41,953
SAM: I wish Vax were here.

2229
02:34:41,953 --> 02:34:44,877
TRAVIS: Don't we have earrings?

2230
02:34:44,877 --> 02:34:48,706
SAM: You know what, we are but they have a
range.

2231
02:34:48,706 --> 02:34:50,942
LAURA: They do have a range.

2232
02:34:50,942 --> 02:34:54,665
SAM: Come in, Vax. Earth to Vax. Tune in Tokyo.

2233
02:34:54,665 --> 02:35:00,237
MATT: Approximately where are you right now?

2234
02:35:00,237 --> 02:35:03,793
MARISHA: So many secrets!

2235
02:35:03,793 --> 02:35:05,508
MATT: I love the whispers!

2236
02:35:05,508 --> 02:35:15,555
SAM: He's gone to Whitestone!

2237
02:35:15,555 --> 02:35:20,735
MATT: All right, there is no response. He really
is out of range.

2238
02:35:20,735 --> 02:35:24,771
SAM: Percy, I need you for your words, and Keyleth
for your magic. Let's go.

2239
02:35:24,771 --> 02:35:25,996
MARISHA: All right.

2240
02:35:25,996 --> 02:35:27,054
LAURA: We're useless.

2241
02:35:27,054 --> 02:35:29,090
MARISHA: Can I heal myself up first?

2242
02:35:29,090 --> 02:35:32,354
SAM: Sure, if you've got a little left for me.
Wait, I can give us--

2243
02:35:32,354 --> 02:35:35,235
MARISHA: Oh wait, Pike! Will you hook us up?

2244
02:35:35,235 --> 02:35:38,300
MATT: "Yeah," And she goes over and--

2245
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:40,731
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and do a quick repair
to my gun, also.

2246
02:35:40,731 --> 02:35:47,439
MATT: Okay, go for it. She throws down a couple of
Cure Light Wounds. She's going to do 3rd level to

2247
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:48,557
each of you.

2248
02:35:48,557 --> 02:35:49,747
MARISHA: Dope.

2249
02:35:49,747 --> 02:36:05,557
MATT: Of Cure Wounds. This'll be 3d8 plus five to
each of you. So 23 to you, and 21 to you, Scanlan.

2250
02:36:05,557 --> 02:36:10,887
She'll do a third one to you, Keyleth. Because
you're looking pretty rough, right Keyleth?

2251
02:36:10,887 --> 02:36:12,316
MARISHA: Huh?

2252
02:36:12,316 --> 02:36:13,408
MATT: You're looking pretty rough?

2253
02:36:13,408 --> 02:36:16,020
MARISHA: I'm at 65 now, with that. So I'm still 30
under.

2254
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:23,196
MATT: So on top of that you get another 13. Pike's
going to stay with you guys.

2255
02:36:23,196 --> 02:36:26,009
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2256
02:36:26,009 --> 02:36:31,457
MATT: All right, so. While you guys count the gold
and what you managed to gather, you find in the--

2257
02:36:31,457 --> 02:36:33,396
LAURA: Out of sight of Zed! Just so you know.

2258
02:36:33,396 --> 02:36:37,923
MATT: Not a worry. You manage to pull from the
hoard entirely, out of gold, silver, copper,

2259
02:36:37,923 --> 02:36:42,319
platinum, the equivalent of 4,150 gold pieces.

2260
02:36:42,319 --> 02:36:44,121
TRAVIS: Wow.

2261
02:36:44,121 --> 02:36:46,436
LIAM: There was another 20 or 30g there.

2262
02:36:46,436 --> 02:36:47,778
LAURA: I know, right?

2263
02:36:47,778 --> 02:36:48,823
LIAM: Probably.

2264
02:36:48,823 --> 02:36:49,801
SAM: We can go back.

2265
02:36:49,801 --> 02:36:51,210
MARISHA: How much? 4,000?

2266
02:36:51,210 --> 02:36:52,646
MATT: 4,150 gold.

2267
02:36:52,646 --> 02:36:54,482
TRAVIS: You don't want to go back in there.

2268
02:36:54,482 --> 02:36:58,003
MATT: About 1,050 gold worth of gems.

2269
02:36:58,003 --> 02:37:00,460
LAURA: 1,050.

2270
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:08,483
MATT: Yep, in gems. Mark that. And about 750 gold
approximately of art items, knick knacks, things

2271
02:37:08,483 --> 02:37:12,230
that you would have to find a specific seller to
really get the money for them.

2272
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:13,818
LAURA: (singing) Knick knacks.

2273
02:37:13,818 --> 02:37:14,827
SAM: Tchotchkes.

2274
02:37:14,827 --> 02:37:17,972
MATT: Yeah, like small jade statues, bits of
jewelry...

2275
02:37:17,972 --> 02:37:20,761
LAURA: And how much in platinum?

2276
02:37:20,761 --> 02:37:26,033
MATT: Well, the gold equivalent of platinum is
what it would be. The total amount is 4,000. But

2277
02:37:26,033 --> 02:37:35,229
nice try. All right, so. You guys make your way--
After asking around a bit, you figure the closest

2278
02:37:35,229 --> 02:37:37,293
stockade is the Promenade stockade.

2279
02:37:37,293 --> 02:37:38,882
SAM: Oh, there's multiple stockades.

2280
02:37:38,882 --> 02:37:45,014
MATT: There are. But that's the one that's closest
to the keep and the first place you should start.

2281
02:37:45,014 --> 02:37:50,620
So you make your way towards the Promenade
stockade. It's a fairly grim-looking grey stone

2282
02:37:50,620 --> 02:37:56,482
building on the outskirts of Abdar's Promenade,
which is a very, very, bombastic, colorful

2283
02:37:56,482 --> 02:38:04,270
gathering of tents and buildings and various
shopkeeps. As you walk to the outside of it,

2284
02:38:04,270 --> 02:38:08,952
approaching, you can see immediately, there on the
steps, is most of Dr. Dranzel's troupe, just

2285
02:38:08,952 --> 02:38:13,986
sitting on the outside steps with two guards at
the door. And they're all talking amongst

2286
02:38:13,986 --> 02:38:19,348
themselves, waiting outside. Dr. Dranzel is not
amongst them. As you begin to step closer--

2287
02:38:19,348 --> 02:38:21,433
SAM: He got nabbed, too, didn't he?

2288
02:38:21,433 --> 02:38:30,200
MATT: (laughs) As you step closer, you can see
they wave you down, and they recognize you and

2289
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:34,468
approach you with an excited look on their face
as if they now have some sort of backup.

2290
02:38:34,468 --> 02:38:39,365
MARISHA: I'm going to whisper to Scanlan. I'm
going to say, I'm going to stay back. You go

2291
02:38:39,365 --> 02:38:40,386
ahead.

2292
02:38:40,386 --> 02:38:41,610
SAM: All right, thanks.

2293
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:50,971
MATT: So Kent Plucker approaches you as you
approach and goes like, "Scanlan. Good thing

2294
02:38:50,971 --> 02:38:54,966
"you're here. I think we may need your silvered
tongue to go ahead and help us out in this

2295
02:38:54,966 --> 02:38:58,626
"endeavor. Dr. Dranzel's inside; he's been arguing
with the warden for quite some time. We're trying

2296
02:38:58,626 --> 02:39:00,285
"to get Kaylie out."

2297
02:39:00,285 --> 02:39:02,395
SAM: What happened? Why is she in jail?

2298
02:39:02,395 --> 02:39:07,780
MATT: "She got in a bit of a bar fight last night,
it seems. Messed up quite a few gentlemen and all

2299
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:14,240
"of them are arrested and being held inside.
They're wanting a bit of change to do the damages

2300
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:22,500
"and pay for the fine of whatever else she's done.
And, well, we're not keen on really paying fines,

2301
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:24,821
"so we're trying to see how much we can get out of
this with our--"

2302
02:39:24,821 --> 02:39:26,182
SAM: What's the fine?

2303
02:39:26,182 --> 02:39:29,265
MATT: "I don't know. We didn't go in as a full
group. The guards wouldn't let us."

2304
02:39:29,265 --> 02:39:31,050
SAM: Was she injured in any way?

2305
02:39:31,050 --> 02:39:33,267
MATT: "I haven't seen her. You'll have to go
inside to find out."

2306
02:39:33,267 --> 02:39:39,838
SAM: All right. Thank you. You won't be needed
here anymore. You guys can leave.

2307
02:39:39,838 --> 02:39:44,698
MATT: They all look at each other. "If it's fine
by you, we're going to wait for Dr. Dranzel."

2308
02:39:44,698 --> 02:39:48,368
SAM: Oh yes, all right. Percy.

2309
02:39:48,368 --> 02:39:49,340
TALIESIN: Yes?

2310
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:51,151
SAM: What do you think our play is here?

2311
02:39:51,151 --> 02:39:52,597
TALIESIN: Well--

2312
02:39:52,597 --> 02:39:58,884
SAM: Should we go in and pay? Should we do a bit
of a ruse? You still have your Hat of Disguise, right?

2313
02:39:58,884 --> 02:40:05,353
TALIESIN: Yes, but I think I'm more useful as
myself, rather than anybody else.

2314
02:40:05,353 --> 02:40:07,970
SAM: Well, you could be a guard taking me in
there.

2315
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:12,581
TALIESIN: I think on a certain level, you're
possibly making this more complicated than it

2316
02:40:12,581 --> 02:40:13,484
needs to be.

2317
02:40:13,484 --> 02:40:15,980
SAM: Yeah, but it's fun, though? No, no, you're
right, we should just go in and talk.

2318
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:21,996
TALIESIN: You forget you have clout. Part of the
point of clout is that you spend it. You spend

2319
02:40:21,996 --> 02:40:23,169
your clout.

2320
02:40:23,169 --> 02:40:24,508
SAM: Oh, all right.

2321
02:40:24,508 --> 02:40:29,305
TALIESIN: I know you're not used to actually
having the means by which to just simply get what

2322
02:40:29,305 --> 02:40:35,629
you want by asking for it. But you could just...
ask for it.

2323
02:40:35,629 --> 02:40:38,129
MARISHA: That was the most privileged thing you've
ever said.

2324
02:40:38,129 --> 02:40:40,338
TALIESIN: That's the most privileged thing 
I've ever said that you've heard.

2325
02:40:40,338 --> 02:40:42,043
(laughter)

2326
02:40:42,043 --> 02:40:43,680
MARISHA: Touché.

2327
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:45,640
LIAM: Marisha has a high clout score.

2328
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:53,560
SAM: So you think just walk on in there. No
subterfuge, no sneaky-sneaky, no breaking down doors?

2329
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:55,394
TALIESIN: Well, a little subterfuge. Let me--

2330
02:40:55,394 --> 02:40:59,302
MARISHA: I've got Polymorph. I can always be a
tiny thing in your pocket.

2331
02:40:59,302 --> 02:41:01,536
SAM: Who said that?

2332
02:41:01,536 --> 02:41:06,690
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm back here. I figured Percy and
I were waiting back here.

2333
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,959
SAM: Oh, okay, hi.

2334
02:41:07,959 --> 02:41:18,393
TALIESIN: Let me attempt to see if I can defuse
this relatively easily. I will need some gold.

2335
02:41:18,393 --> 02:41:22,619
SAM: Are you lying to me to get me to pay you for
a new gun?

2336
02:41:22,619 --> 02:41:27,325
TALIESIN: No, but that's a very good point. So
later I will be asking for some gold to help me

2337
02:41:27,325 --> 02:41:28,962
fix my new gun.

2338
02:41:28,962 --> 02:41:30,940
SAM: All right, I'll give you what you need.

2339
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:32,047
TALIESIN: All right.

2340
02:41:32,047 --> 02:41:33,541
MARISHA: Do you have gold, Scanlan?

2341
02:41:33,541 --> 02:41:34,592
SAM: I do.

2342
02:41:34,592 --> 02:41:38,689
TALIESIN: Okay, we may have to have a discussion.
At the very least I'm going to need 20 gold, at

2343
02:41:38,689 --> 02:41:39,710
the very least.

2344
02:41:39,710 --> 02:41:40,513
SAM: 20?

2345
02:41:40,513 --> 02:41:41,444
TALIESIN: 20 gold, at the very least.

2346
02:41:41,444 --> 02:41:42,690
SAM: You don't have 20 gold?

2347
02:41:42,690 --> 02:41:44,635
TALIESIN: Oh, I do. Just not for your daughter.

2348
02:41:44,635 --> 02:41:45,579
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

2349
02:41:45,579 --> 02:41:49,074
(laughter)

2350
02:41:49,074 --> 02:41:50,336
SAM: Take 50.

2351
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:51,657
TALIESIN: That will do.

2352
02:41:51,657 --> 02:41:53,337
MATT: So you guys approach?

2353
02:41:53,337 --> 02:41:59,751
MARISHA: No trips to Coldstone with Percy. You are
not the Godfather.

2354
02:41:59,751 --> 02:42:01,457
TALIESIN: I will take you to White Castle,
though.

2355
02:42:01,457 --> 02:42:06,933
MATT: You come to the front steps of the stockade,
there are two guards there, with tower shields and

2356
02:42:06,933 --> 02:42:12,380
what looks like halberds to each of them. One of
them steps forward, putting his shield out. Not in

2357
02:42:12,380 --> 02:42:17,434
an aggressive way, but definitely in an
attention-gathering way. "Do you have business here

2358
02:42:17,504 --> 02:42:18,616
"in the stockade?"

2359
02:42:18,616 --> 02:42:20,927
TALIESIN: I do; I wish to speak to the warden.

2360
02:42:20,927 --> 02:42:24,226
MATT: "The warden is indisposed in conversation at
the moment."

2361
02:42:24,226 --> 02:42:30,449
TALIESIN: Well, he will agree to be indisposed in
conversation with me. I'm Percival Fredrickstein

2362
02:42:30,449 --> 02:42:36,337
Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. And I'm here on
the business of Whitestone.

2363
02:42:36,337 --> 02:42:38,327
SAM: He's an ambassador.

2364
02:42:38,327 --> 02:42:47,623
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. I'll say with
advantage due to the very, very, intense,

2365
02:42:47,623 --> 02:42:50,471
believable stare of Scanlan backing you up.

2366
02:42:50,471 --> 02:42:55,189
TALIESIN: 19.

2367
02:42:55,189 --> 02:43:02,488
MATT: He gives a nod. "All right, but good luck."
The two guards open the doors, and as they do you

2368
02:43:02,488 --> 02:43:06,820
can already hear raised voices shouting back and
forth. Can't really make out the words, but as you

2369
02:43:06,820 --> 02:43:12,478
step into the inside you can see there is a
clerk's desk. With a clerk sitting there,

2370
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:16,486
keeping one ear closed as he's trying to write in
a book. To the immediate right of them, there is

2371
02:43:16,528 --> 02:43:22,374
Dr. Dranzel in an argument with a gentleman with a
well-kept mustache, thick over the top lip,

2372
02:43:22,374 --> 02:43:26,924
slicked black hair that curls up in the back in a
small poof. He's wearing a breastplate and is

2373
02:43:26,924 --> 02:43:32,878
standing with an appearance of self-importance. At
which point, as you approach, Dr. Dranzel turns

2374
02:43:32,878 --> 02:43:35,754
and goes, "Oh good. Someone with actual--"

2375
02:43:35,754 --> 02:43:38,834
TALIESIN: Shush! Who is this person?

2376
02:43:38,834 --> 02:43:45,139
MATT: Everyone gets quiet and the individual
standing there goes, "Well apparently, he's the

2377
02:43:45,139 --> 02:43:47,827
"man who's bothering me. Hm?"

2378
02:43:47,827 --> 02:43:49,842
TALIESIN: What do you do, sir?

2379
02:43:49,842 --> 02:43:53,534
SAM: I just throw Dranzel a quick little wink.

2380
02:43:53,534 --> 02:43:55,640
TALIESIN: What do you do, sir?

2381
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:57,817
MATT: "I'm a performer." (slight chuckle)

2382
02:43:57,817 --> 02:44:01,495
TALIESIN: Excellent, he's a performer. You may
leave, we have no need of you.

2383
02:44:01,495 --> 02:44:04,002
LAURA: (whispered) Oh, shit.

2384
02:44:04,002 --> 02:44:07,456
MATT: "Hmph." He adjusts his hat and--

2385
02:44:07,456 --> 02:44:09,551
TALIESIN: Guard, escort the commoner out of the
room.

2386
02:44:09,551 --> 02:44:16,386
MATT: The guards instinctively step up and take
his arms and they lead him out. Dr. Dranzel, taken

2387
02:44:16,386 --> 02:44:19,367
aback and the whole time he's looking at Scanlan
with this look of like--

2388
02:44:19,367 --> 02:44:21,580
SAM: You heard the ambassador; please leave.

2389
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:23,925
(laughter)

2390
02:44:23,925 --> 02:44:28,847
MATT: (boom) The doors close behind. The
individual steps forward.

2391
02:44:28,847 --> 02:44:31,979
TALIESIN: Now that that's been taken care of, who
is an authority that I may speak to?

2392
02:44:31,979 --> 02:44:37,517
MATT: "That, I'm afraid, would be me. (sly
chuckle) Pleasure to meet you. I'm Warden Cyrus

2393
02:44:37,517 --> 02:44:39,635
"Hume. What is your name?"

2394
02:44:39,635 --> 02:44:44,299
TALIESIN: Cyrus Hume. I'm Percival Fredrickstein
Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone.

2395
02:44:44,299 --> 02:44:47,362
MATT: "This does me no service."

2396
02:44:47,362 --> 02:44:48,790
TALIESIN: It will.

2397
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:49,855
MATT: "Hmph."

2398
02:44:49,855 --> 02:44:56,713
TALIESIN: I am, of course, the newly appointed
ambassador from Whitestone, and I have been

2399
02:44:56,713 --> 02:45:01,342
brought down here because apparently you are
holding one of my performers. A performer who is

2400
02:45:01,342 --> 02:45:07,448
meant to be heading towards Whitestone in the next
three weeks to perform for my sister.

2401
02:45:07,448 --> 02:45:09,806
MATT: "Describe your performer, sir."

2402
02:45:09,806 --> 02:45:15,358
TALIESIN: Oh, small, plain, female. (dismissive
sigh)

2403
02:45:15,358 --> 02:45:22,812
MATT: (sighs heavily) "I know of the one you speak.
The same one we're arguing-- I assume this other

2404
02:45:22,812 --> 02:45:25,630
"individual that just left is one of your
performers as well."

2405
02:45:25,630 --> 02:45:30,752
TALIESIN: Yes, he is. He is one of the official
performers-- they're supposed to be performing at

2406
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:36,444
the new coronation of a brand new temple in
Whitestone. Much has been arranged, much has been

2407
02:45:36,444 --> 02:45:41,382
paid for, and I don't want to explain any of this
to the royal court.

2408
02:45:41,382 --> 02:45:44,373
MATT: Make a deception check.

2409
02:45:44,373 --> 02:45:52,036
TALIESIN: Casting-- no, not yet. 13.

2410
02:45:52,036 --> 02:45:54,487
MATT: Okay. He goes--

2411
02:45:54,487 --> 02:45:59,543
TALIESIN: If you were to be agreeable to helping
us move this along, I would remember the favor.

2412
02:45:59,543 --> 02:46:01,673
Whitestone would remember the favor.

2413
02:46:01,673 --> 02:46:10,629
MATT: "Good. Well, listen. There are fines for
damages, or she sits until tried. Now."

2414
02:46:10,629 --> 02:46:11,736
TALIESIN: Damages?

2415
02:46:11,736 --> 02:46:16,897
MATT: "The damages to the Nervous Brook pub are
estimated to be upwards of 450 gold pieces, and

2416
02:46:16,897 --> 02:46:22,469
"the fine for drunken battery and disturbing the
peace amounts to 250 gold pieces. 700 total and I

2417
02:46:22,469 --> 02:46:25,591
"would gladly let you take that rabid dug-grubber
off of my hands."

2418
02:46:25,591 --> 02:46:29,268
SAM: You'll watch what you say about her.

2419
02:46:29,268 --> 02:46:31,173
MATT: "Oh, will I?"

2420
02:46:31,173 --> 02:46:39,502
TALIESIN: Shush, performer. Well, sir, I
appreciate your candor, I appreciate the cut of

2421
02:46:39,502 --> 02:46:47,367
your jib, and I appreciate that you are a man of
honor and of your station. It is very, very rare

2422
02:46:47,367 --> 02:46:53,172
to find someone who respects such things.
Obviously the damages must be paid--

2423
02:46:53,172 --> 02:46:58,265
MATT: "If you wish to discuss it with the three
in question--" He points to one of the cells on the

2424
02:46:58,265 --> 02:47:02,428
other side of the room and you can see that there
is a set of bars, and you can vaguely see what

2425
02:47:02,428 --> 02:47:09,055
looks like the shape of a person who's just
slumped in the cell. Mostly cast in shadow.

2426
02:47:09,055 --> 02:47:10,259
TALIESIN: Who are they?

2427
02:47:10,259 --> 02:47:14,847
MATT: "Bar patrons. And they're all worse for
wear."

2428
02:47:14,847 --> 02:47:17,221
TALIESIN: Do we know what happened?

2429
02:47:17,221 --> 02:47:23,260
MATT: "The dog has teeth. Three against one, if
the stories say true. The bar patrons and the

2430
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:28,191
"owner of the establishment all verified that she
indeed started and finished it."

2431
02:47:28,191 --> 02:47:33,404
TALIESIN: I don't care who started or finished it.
Obviously, we will pay for the damages out of your

2432
02:47:33,404 --> 02:47:35,122
troupe's pocket.

2433
02:47:35,122 --> 02:47:40,371
SAM: Your majesty, are you sure you don't want to
write a check from the treasury?

2434
02:47:40,371 --> 02:47:42,066
TALIESIN: Quite.

2435
02:47:42,066 --> 02:47:47,028
SAM: I've got the checkbook with me. We could just
write a check.

2436
02:47:47,028 --> 02:47:53,463
TALIESIN: We will write a check for our friend's
pocket, but for the damages, I feel that some

2437
02:47:53,463 --> 02:47:55,796
responsibility must be taken.

2438
02:47:55,796 --> 02:48:02,170
MATT: "I'm not familiar with this check you speak
of. I deal in gold, as does Emon. What good does

2439
02:48:02,170 --> 02:48:06,999
"this do me in my station if I am to show up with a
simple piece of paper?"

2440
02:48:06,999 --> 02:48:11,893
TALIESIN: He has a very fair point.

2441
02:48:11,893 --> 02:48:15,707
SAM: (whispers) Your brand of subterfuge is not
what I had in mind.

2442
02:48:15,707 --> 02:48:19,111
(laughter)

2443
02:48:19,111 --> 02:48:25,399
TALIESIN: What good is subterfuge when there's
such an opportunity to create a ballad? Some sort

2444
02:48:25,399 --> 02:48:27,862
of ballad about a cautionary tale.

2445
02:48:27,862 --> 02:48:33,930
SAM: I could have picked anyone to be with me
here. Not this. You're rubbing my face in it

2446
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:35,520
because I threw your gun in the lava.

2447
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:40,953
TALIESIN: You chose so poorly. You chose so
poorly. It is truly impressive how poorly you chose.

2448
02:48:40,953 --> 02:48:48,242
MATT: "Stop wasting my time, if you're going to
retrieve this invalid, do so quickly."

2449
02:48:48,242 --> 02:48:53,943
TALIESIN: You may come pick up your gold from
Castle Greyskull in the morning. It will be

2450
02:48:53,943 --> 02:49:02,059
waiting for you, of course, sir. In the meantime,
here is 20 gold for your trouble. On top of the

2451
02:49:02,059 --> 02:49:05,316
gold you will be expecting for all fines imposed.

2452
02:49:05,316 --> 02:49:18,156
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2453
02:49:18,156 --> 02:49:20,695
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) One.

2454
02:49:20,695 --> 02:49:22,053
MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

2455
02:49:22,053 --> 02:49:24,187
TALIESIN: All right, bring it. Bring it.

2456
02:49:24,187 --> 02:49:33,871
MATT: "Well, I appreciate your attempt to maneuver
around my station of which you hold so clear.

2457
02:49:33,871 --> 02:49:40,529
"You seemingly attempt to bribe a warden of the
stockade in an attempt to retrieve what appears to

2458
02:49:40,529 --> 02:49:47,974
"be a relatively... How do I put it? Immoral,
destitute and feral creature."

2459
02:49:47,974 --> 02:49:56,008
SAM: Warden. This is just like this bastard. He
always goes around trying to boss people around

2460
02:49:56,008 --> 02:49:59,990
and throw his money around. And I turn and I punch
Percy in the face.

2461
02:49:59,990 --> 02:50:03,270
MATT: Okay! Roll for an attack.

2462
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:13,055
SAM: Oh, shit. Going for another one. A nine.
Probably not.

2463
02:50:13,055 --> 02:50:14,566
MATT: Plus your strength modifier.

2464
02:50:14,566 --> 02:50:18,000
SAM: I don't have any strength. One, so that's
ten.

2465
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,201
MATT: Ten. Percy, do you take it?

2466
02:50:20,201 --> 02:50:22,911
TALIESIN: Yes, I take it.

2467
02:50:22,911 --> 02:50:28,410
MATT: Okay. Whack! A solid hit across the face.
You have to lean into it and make it look more

2468
02:50:28,410 --> 02:50:29,727
impactful than it really is.

2469
02:50:29,727 --> 02:50:32,091
TALIESIN: (overly dramatic) Oh!

2470
02:50:32,091 --> 02:50:34,900
SAM: And then I turn around, and I punch a guard.

2471
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:37,322
LAURA: Oh my god.

2472
02:50:37,322 --> 02:50:39,068
TALIESIN: Where are you going with this?

2473
02:50:39,068 --> 02:50:40,461
MATT: Roll another attack.

2474
02:50:40,461 --> 02:50:44,075
SAM: 13.

2475
02:50:44,075 --> 02:50:48,949
MATT: 13. You whirl around, and one of the guards
is rushing forward to try and break this up, and

2476
02:50:48,949 --> 02:50:54,022
as you swing towards him, your fist collides with
the side of his helmet. It definitely shakes him

2477
02:50:54,022 --> 02:50:57,222
for a second. It doesn't do much in the way of
damage, but it does kind of hurt your knuckles a

2478
02:50:57,222 --> 02:50:59,602
little bit. Now the guard's like, (startled sound)
and stumbles back a bit.

2479
02:50:59,602 --> 02:51:05,119
SAM: I've just had enough with all of you people.
We performers demand respect and deserve it as well.

2480
02:51:05,119 --> 02:51:09,643
MATT: The warden's now stepped forward and put his
hand on the side of his blade and says, "Am I to

2481
02:51:09,643 --> 02:51:13,717
"understand you walked in here and immediately
struck a guard of the stockade?"

2482
02:51:13,717 --> 02:51:17,739
SAM: I've just had it up to here with being bossed
around by people like him.

2483
02:51:17,739 --> 02:51:23,406
MATT: "Well, would it make you feel better if he's
thrown in prison?"

2484
02:51:23,406 --> 02:51:25,489
SAM: It would.

2485
02:51:25,489 --> 02:51:27,536
TALIESIN: It would make me feel better if he was
thrown in prison.

2486
02:51:27,536 --> 02:51:29,498
MATT: "Oh, don't worry. You'll both be going."

2487
02:51:29,498 --> 02:51:34,582
MARISHA: About this time, I come over the earpiece
and I go, how's it going in there, guys?

2488
02:51:34,582 --> 02:51:35,470
SAM: Great.

2489
02:51:35,470 --> 02:51:37,092
TALIESIN: Great. Everything's fine.

2490
02:51:37,092 --> 02:51:38,601
(laughter)

2491
02:51:38,601 --> 02:51:40,996
MARISHA: Good. Just let me know if you need me.

2492
02:51:40,996 --> 02:51:48,480
MATT: He looks to the side and two guards now, one
of the ones that punched you and another one to

2493
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:50,846
the side both step up and are reaching--

2494
02:51:50,846 --> 02:51:53,698
TALIESIN: Won't it be unfortunate when you find
out I have diplomatic immunity?

2495
02:51:53,698 --> 02:51:56,280
SAM: Diplomatic immunity.

2496
02:51:56,280 --> 02:52:00,753
MATT: You both have been manhandled and brought
your hands behind. You feel manacles being pulled

2497
02:52:00,753 --> 02:52:03,893
forth, and the warden's just looking down upon
both of you.

2498
02:52:03,893 --> 02:52:07,663
TALIESIN: I blame you for this.

2499
02:52:07,663 --> 02:52:12,183
SAM: You should blame me for this. I'm sorry. I
just had a really shitty day, all right? He

2500
02:52:12,183 --> 02:52:14,960
doesn't deserve this. Let him go. Just take me.

2501
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:25,889
MATT: "Very well. Now." And you feel the release
as the manacles come away. You are escorted out of

2502
02:52:25,889 --> 02:52:31,433
the room. You are put in shackles, brought, and
thrown into the same jail cell as Kaylie.

2503
02:52:31,433 --> 02:52:35,361
TALIESIN: All right. How much to get both of them
out?

2504
02:52:35,361 --> 02:52:37,306
MATT: As you're being pushed out?

2505
02:52:37,306 --> 02:52:39,217
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'll bring it.

2506
02:52:39,217 --> 02:52:43,344
MATT: There's no answer at the moment. The doors
close behind you, and you're thrust off of four

2507
02:52:43,344 --> 02:52:45,797
steps. Make an acrobatics check.

2508
02:52:45,797 --> 02:52:49,017
MARISHA: They were tossing your ass out.

2509
02:52:49,017 --> 02:52:51,118
TALIESIN: 23.

2510
02:52:51,118 --> 02:52:54,856
MATT: All right. You manage to catch yourself with
a small tumble over the shoulder, land Willy

2511
02:52:54,856 --> 02:53:03,379
Wonka-style, well stuck. As you're thrown, you hit
the ground. You can see off in the corner of the

2512
02:53:03,379 --> 02:53:08,918
cell, Kaylie, arms crossed, sitting on the ground.
She leans forward a little bit, and you can see

2513
02:53:08,918 --> 02:53:12,654
the light hits the side of her face, and she has a
bit of a welt there and a bit of a black eye, but

2514
02:53:12,654 --> 02:53:15,163
she doesn't look too worse for wear.

2515
02:53:15,163 --> 02:53:18,706
TALIESIN: Now for the love of God, just wait until
nightfall and Dimension Door out of there.

2516
02:53:18,706 --> 02:53:20,622
SAM: Did I hear that?

2517
02:53:20,622 --> 02:53:22,499
MATT: Yeah, you'd hear that.

2518
02:53:22,499 --> 02:53:25,882
SAM: Good idea. Thanks, Percy, for your help.

2519
02:53:25,882 --> 02:53:29,439
TALIESIN: You're welcome. Wait until nightfall.

2520
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:31,446
SAM: Huh? Oh. All right.

2521
02:53:31,446 --> 02:53:36,677
MATT: As she leans forward, she goes, "Huh. Like
father, like daughter, aye?"

2522
02:53:36,677 --> 02:53:41,529
SAM: You could say so. I heard you had quite a
night last night at the bar.

2523
02:53:41,529 --> 02:53:44,742
MATT: "Hm. Felt good. I like breaking faces."

2524
02:53:44,742 --> 02:53:49,563
SAM: Apparently you're very good at it. I saw-- I
got a glimpse of your victims over there.

2525
02:53:49,563 --> 02:53:54,219
MATT: (laughs) "They had it coming. Don't know
why, but I had a feeling somewhere in their life,

2526
02:53:54,219 --> 02:53:57,301
"they probably deserved it. Most men do."

2527
02:53:57,301 --> 02:54:04,142
SAM: Yep, you're right about that. Stay away from
all men. Forever.

2528
02:54:04,142 --> 02:54:08,587
MATT: "They were fuckwits. Their faces were so
punchable."

2529
02:54:08,587 --> 02:54:13,783
SAM: I know that feeling. Listen, I've come to get
you out of here.

2530
02:54:13,783 --> 02:54:16,998
MATT: (laughs) "Apparently you've not done that
very well."

2531
02:54:16,998 --> 02:54:21,939
SAM: Don't worry. I've still got some tricks up my
sleeve. Just wanted to make sure you're all right.

2532
02:54:21,939 --> 02:54:24,049
Did they hurt you in any way?

2533
02:54:24,049 --> 02:54:29,145
MATT: "Only one person's really hurt me
recently."

2534
02:54:29,145 --> 02:54:31,756
LIAM: Cold as ice.

2535
02:54:31,756 --> 02:54:44,000
MATT: "Look, Scanlan. Father. I spent a lifetime
hating you. I'd imagined the moment we would

2536
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:55,677
"finally meet for so long, planned it out in my
head, had it all worked out. My idea of you, what

2537
02:54:55,677 --> 02:55:09,386
"you'd be like, what you'd say, and you know what?
Up until last night, I was pretty spot-on. I don't

2538
02:55:09,386 --> 02:55:21,397
"know what I wanted. I have a lot to process, to
think about. But I'd prefer not to do it in this

2539
02:55:21,397 --> 02:55:24,865
"dank cell, so if you have a way out, please, now's
the time to do it."

2540
02:55:24,865 --> 02:55:27,705
SAM: You think now? All right, is anyone
watching?

2541
02:55:27,705 --> 02:55:32,378
MATT: There are two guards that are not watching
directly, but they're muscled up against the bars

2542
02:55:32,378 --> 02:55:34,339
and keeping an eye over the shoulder.

2543
02:55:34,339 --> 02:55:39,426
SAM: I'll need a distraction. Do you think you can
come up with one?

2544
02:55:39,426 --> 02:55:50,915
MATT: Her eyes turn for a second and she goes,
(chuckles) "I think that can be done." She leans

2545
02:55:50,915 --> 02:55:57,825
up to the side of the bar and peeks her head out
for a second. Closes her mouth, cups it with her

2546
02:55:57,825 --> 02:56:03,919
hand, and you start hearing from the opposite side
of the room, through arcane ventriloquism, these

2547
02:56:03,919 --> 02:56:09,120
three different male voices going, "I'll fuck you
up!" You hear punches and you hear all of this

2548
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:14,276
screaming and chaos. At which point, the two
guards look over. One of them gives the other a

2549
02:56:14,276 --> 02:56:17,558
motion, and they both run off to see the other
side of the room. She looks back at you.

2550
02:56:17,558 --> 02:56:23,615
SAM: You'll have to teach me that trick. And then
I Dimension Door us out onto the street.

2551
02:56:23,615 --> 02:56:28,371
MATT: As you reach for her, she still pulls away a
little bit, but you still grab hold and (poof)

2552
02:56:28,371 --> 02:56:32,876
puff of smoke. You guys (magic sound) appear
outside, landing a couple of feet above the ground

2553
02:56:32,876 --> 02:56:38,161
and catch yourselves. You're off to the side of
the stockade where it meets with one of the nearby

2554
02:56:38,161 --> 02:56:44,083
walls. No one seems to immediately notice you,
other than a couple of people that are walking

2555
02:56:44,083 --> 02:56:47,862
down the street that see two individuals appear
out of the ether and land onto the ground.

2556
02:56:47,862 --> 02:56:58,174
SAM: All right. Let's get out of here. Percy, I
didn't wait quite until nightfall.

2557
02:56:58,174 --> 02:57:00,668
TALIESIN: I assumed you wouldn't. We're already
walking back.

2558
02:57:00,668 --> 02:57:02,590
SAM: All right, we'll catch up.

2559
02:57:02,590 --> 02:57:05,574
MATT: You guys head back towards Greyskull? All
right.

2560
02:57:05,574 --> 02:57:08,363
MARISHA: I'm glad I came in handy for that field
trip.

2561
02:57:08,363 --> 02:57:12,594
SAM: Oh, shit! Burn it down! Burn the stockades
down!

2562
02:57:12,594 --> 02:57:18,301
LIAM: I'd also like to point out that Grog's
single nut-flick did more damage than your two

2563
02:57:18,301 --> 02:57:19,480
full-on punches.

2564
02:57:19,480 --> 02:57:22,289
(laughter)

2565
02:57:22,289 --> 02:57:37,121
MATT: This is true! All right. Eventually, you
guys make your way back. As you do, you gather,

2566
02:57:37,121 --> 02:57:42,812
and about five minutes behind you, the rest of Dr.
Dranzel's troupe arrives, looking a little bit

2567
02:57:42,812 --> 02:57:49,019
frazzled and a little confused. He steps forward
to the rest of you and goes, "I don't know what

2568
02:57:49,019 --> 02:57:56,355
"you did, but there's a manhunt for two gnomes
right now over by the Promenade. But good on you.

2569
02:57:56,355 --> 02:57:58,526
"Might want to lay low for a little bit."

2570
02:57:58,526 --> 02:58:00,114
SAM: Good thinking.

2571
02:58:00,114 --> 02:58:02,686
TALIESIN: The troupe may want to get out of town
for a bit, as well.

2572
02:58:02,686 --> 02:58:05,863
MATT: "I think that's the plan. We were going to
stay a few more days-- we had a couple of gigs

2573
02:58:05,863 --> 02:58:12,911
"lined up, but I think we've pressed our luck far
enough, so all right! Everyone feeling

2574
02:58:12,911 --> 02:58:18,649
"spectacular?" He claps his hands and the rest of
the troupe start grabbing their goods and their

2575
02:58:18,649 --> 02:58:24,271
instruments and what little cases and bags they
do. Kaylie runs off real fast and comes back with

2576
02:58:24,271 --> 02:58:31,453
her one over-the-shoulder satchel that carries all
of her worldly belongings. "Then let us be off."

2577
02:58:31,453 --> 02:58:37,680
He gives a little tip of the hat to Scanlan with a
nod. Looks to the rest of you. "We greatly

2578
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:44,147
"appreciate your hospitality. We're sorry for any
confusion, misunderstandings, and general

2579
02:58:44,147 --> 02:58:51,320
"debauchery. Good night to you all." He turns
around and they all start walking out. Kaylie

2580
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:57,634
begins stepping and she stops and looks over her
shoulder towards you, Scanlan, and says, "Don't

2581
02:58:57,634 --> 02:59:09,140
"come looking for me. When I'm ready, I'll come
find you." She turns back around and leaves.

2582
02:59:09,140 --> 02:59:11,503
SAM: Oh, shit.

2583
02:59:11,503 --> 02:59:16,821
MARISHA: I liked them. They were fun.

2584
02:59:16,821 --> 02:59:20,754
TRAVIS: Did you tell her you're her dad yet?

2585
02:59:20,754 --> 02:59:30,685
SAM: That's not-- She figured it out, Grog.

2586
02:59:30,685 --> 02:59:33,004
TRAVIS: That's awkward.

2587
02:59:33,004 --> 02:59:37,700
SAM: Yes. Yes, it is.

2588
02:59:37,700 --> 02:59:43,969
LAURA: They forgot to grab their gold. I like
them!

2589
02:59:43,969 --> 02:59:45,925
MATT: That they did, actually.

2590
02:59:45,925 --> 02:59:48,300
MARISHA: Maybe they thought we were even?

2591
02:59:48,300 --> 02:59:50,658
LIAM: Probably should check the silverware,
though, in the keep.

2592
02:59:50,658 --> 02:59:52,667
LAURA: Oh. I run and check the silverware.

2593
02:59:52,667 --> 02:59:55,256
TALIESIN: I check to make sure the skull is still
there.

2594
02:59:55,256 --> 02:59:57,402
MATT: The kitchen is cleaned out.

2595
02:59:57,402 --> 02:59:58,436
LAURA: No!

2596
02:59:58,436 --> 03:00:00,694
MATT: All of the silverware.

2597
03:00:00,694 --> 03:00:03,355
LAURA: What about Jarett? He was supposed to be
keeping an eye on them.

2598
03:00:03,355 --> 03:00:06,020
MARISHA: Yeah, what the fuck? What's with Jarett?

2599
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:12,223
MATT: Jarett was one man keeping track of multiple
people, with one very small, quick child that you

2600
03:00:12,223 --> 03:00:14,782
were the only one able to keep an eye on.

2601
03:00:14,782 --> 03:00:19,413
LAURA: I hate your friends!

2602
03:00:19,413 --> 03:00:21,852
MARISHA: They were good drinking buddies.

2603
03:00:21,852 --> 03:00:25,647
SAM: They're all right. They've got their good
qualities, too.

2604
03:00:25,647 --> 03:00:28,218
TRAVIS: Just the silverware's missing?

2605
03:00:28,218 --> 03:00:31,059
LAURA: What about our rooms? Is it just the
kitchen that's cleaned out, or did they take

2606
03:00:31,059 --> 03:00:32,527
everything in the keep?

2607
03:00:32,527 --> 03:00:41,229
MATT: Oh, no, no, no. None of the rooms have been
touched, except for the guest room where some of

2608
03:00:41,229 --> 03:00:43,115
them were staying.

2609
03:00:43,115 --> 03:00:44,541
LAURA: There was shit in there, anyway.

2610
03:00:44,541 --> 03:00:48,282
MATT: Yeah, there wasn't much in there, but a
couple of candlesticks, things that were just

2611
03:00:48,282 --> 03:00:52,519
decor. Anything that could possibly be hocked for
a little bit of change from those rooms is gone.

2612
03:00:52,519 --> 03:00:57,367
LAURA: They don't know I shopped for everything at
Home Goods, so joke's on them.

2613
03:00:57,367 --> 03:01:02,220
MATT: You gather probably no more than two to
three hundred gold worth of materials were taken

2614
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:08,359
in total. That includes fine cookware, that
includes decor, that includes a couple of previous

2615
03:01:08,359 --> 03:01:10,223
art pieces that you had collected--

2616
03:01:10,223 --> 03:01:13,077
TALIESIN: Please tell me they stole the giant
painting.

2617
03:01:13,077 --> 03:01:14,624
SAM: It's not here yet.

2618
03:01:14,624 --> 03:01:15,685
TALIESIN: Damn it!

2619
03:01:15,685 --> 03:01:18,187
MATT: It hasn't been delivered yet. That's
probably in transit.

2620
03:01:18,187 --> 03:01:19,510
TALIESIN: No!

2621
03:01:19,510 --> 03:01:21,825
LIAM: And where would it have been hidden on their
person?

2622
03:01:21,825 --> 03:01:25,455
TALIESIN: They could have rolled it up and stuck
it where the sun don't shine.

2623
03:01:25,455 --> 03:01:28,612
MARISHA: A 20 by six foot canvas?

2624
03:01:28,612 --> 03:01:31,594
TALIESIN: Some caverns run deep.

2625
03:01:31,594 --> 03:01:35,113
SAM: I'm going to check my bed just to see if
there's any shit on it.

2626
03:01:35,113 --> 03:01:40,097
MATT: You go and inspect pretty extensively. It
does not appear that anyone has left you a Scanlan

2627
03:01:40,097 --> 03:01:41,319
surprise.

2628
03:01:41,319 --> 03:01:49,808
MARISHA: Percy and I go downstairs to make sure
the skull is still there.

2629
03:01:49,808 --> 03:01:52,274
MATT: Skull is still in the workshop, yes.

2630
03:01:52,274 --> 03:01:53,560
MARISHA: Beautiful.

2631
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:55,583
MATT: What do you guys want to do right now?

2632
03:01:55,583 --> 03:02:00,936
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend some time working on
the special barrel and see if I can get that up

2633
03:02:00,936 --> 03:02:02,000
and running.

2634
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,440
MARISHA: What time is it?

2635
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:05,399
MATT: At this point, it's closing towards dusk.

2636
03:02:05,399 --> 03:02:10,444
LAURA: We should heal up and get ready to take
this to Whitestone in the morning, yes?

2637
03:02:10,444 --> 03:02:11,926
MARISHA: I guess so.

2638
03:02:11,926 --> 03:02:13,018
TALIESIN: 18.

2639
03:02:13,018 --> 03:02:22,614
MATT: 18? All right. You disassemble elements of
the pistol. You get the feeling that the way it's

2640
03:02:22,614 --> 03:02:30,359
weighted, to attach the hand mortar to the pistol,
it's still going to continue to be a very unwieldy

2641
03:02:30,359 --> 03:02:38,464
thing. You are probably best to design them as
separate pieces. Unfortunately, the way the

2642
03:02:38,464 --> 03:02:45,645
pistol's balanced, for aim and such? The mechanism
that's required to lob an object for the mortar to

2643
03:02:45,645 --> 03:02:50,383
be able to do any help with is going to throw off
your ability to aim much with the pistol, going

2644
03:02:50,383 --> 03:02:55,050
forward. Not to mention increase the misfire score
by crazy amounts. But you could create them both

2645
03:02:55,050 --> 03:02:56,909
separately and swap out as needed.

2646
03:02:56,909 --> 03:02:58,189
TALIESIN: All right.

2647
03:02:58,189 --> 03:03:06,721
MATT: All right. You guys spend the evening. You
rest up, you're back to full health, you're good

2648
03:03:06,721 --> 03:03:11,075
to go. As the morning comes around--

2649
03:03:11,075 --> 03:03:12,071
TRAVIS: I have a question.

2650
03:03:12,071 --> 03:03:13,020
MATT: Yes?

2651
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:19,400
TRAVIS: Can I wait until everyone goes to bed and
can I make my way into Percy's workshop?

2652
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,850
TALIESIN: It's locked.

2653
03:03:20,850 --> 03:03:24,713
MATT: As you get to the workshop, you check the
door and it is, indeed, locked.

2654
03:03:24,713 --> 03:03:26,704
MARISHA: We stashed it.

2655
03:03:26,704 --> 03:03:28,222
TRAVIS: What's the door made of?

2656
03:03:28,222 --> 03:03:32,966
MATT: It's made of solid metal. It was constructed
per specifications to be able to withstand

2657
03:03:32,966 --> 03:03:36,447
concussive blasts in case of accident from the
inside.

2658
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:40,488
TRAVIS: Can I try to pick the lock?

2659
03:03:40,488 --> 03:03:42,490
MATT: You have no lockpicks.

2660
03:03:42,490 --> 03:03:46,187
TRAVIS: Can I shove an axe in the lock hole?

2661
03:03:46,187 --> 03:03:47,511
MATT: You can.

2662
03:03:47,511 --> 03:03:49,323
SAM: Clang!

2663
03:03:49,323 --> 03:03:51,822
MATT: Make a strength check.

2664
03:03:51,822 --> 03:03:58,891
TRAVIS: I have a greatsword that's just a normal
greatsword.

2665
03:03:58,891 --> 03:04:00,923
LAURA: Are you going to try to shove it in the
lock?

2666
03:04:00,923 --> 03:04:08,220
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a credit card in the side of
the thing. Like a crowbar. That was crap.

2667
03:04:08,220 --> 03:04:10,123
MATT: What did you roll?

2668
03:04:10,123 --> 03:04:11,175
TRAVIS: Ten.

2669
03:04:11,175 --> 03:04:18,419
MATT: Ten. In trying to wedge the sword into the
side of the door, you eventually feel a shift as

2670
03:04:18,419 --> 03:04:23,835
you push. You feel it gives way, and you look and
withdraw the greatsword, which is now bent at an

2671
03:04:23,835 --> 03:04:29,189
angle to the side. Yeah, that sword's not going to
be functional in combat any further.

2672
03:04:29,189 --> 03:04:33,135
TRAVIS: All right, I go to bed.

2673
03:04:33,135 --> 03:04:34,467
MATT: Okay.

2674
03:04:34,467 --> 03:04:38,772
TALIESIN: Nothing good ever happens to you in my
workshop. It's just not a good place for you. Too

2675
03:04:38,772 --> 03:04:40,071
many things.

2676
03:04:40,071 --> 03:04:47,676
MATT: All right, so. Morning comes around. You
guys come back rested. As you each individually

2677
03:04:47,676 --> 03:04:55,665
come to consciousness and finding your way down,
the first thing you're met by is a very perturbed

2678
03:04:55,665 --> 03:05:04,890
Laina, who as soon as you come down, says, "I'm
terribly sorry. I went to make breakfast, and

2679
03:05:04,890 --> 03:05:08,773
"there's nothing to make breakfast with! I don't
know what happened."

2680
03:05:08,773 --> 03:05:16,852
LAURA: It's okay. Scanlan is going to buy all new
stuff for our kitchens.

2681
03:05:16,852 --> 03:05:19,221
SAM: I'm supposed to lay low, though.

2682
03:05:19,221 --> 03:05:22,828
LAURA: Oh, that's okay. You can give her all the
gold that she needs to buy new things for the

2683
03:05:22,828 --> 03:05:23,966
kitchen.

2684
03:05:23,966 --> 03:05:26,521
SAM: I have only--

2685
03:05:26,521 --> 03:05:28,358
LAURA: You have about a thousand gold because I
gave it to you.

2686
03:05:28,358 --> 03:05:31,112
SAM: I gave 50 to Percy, which you didn't use.

2687
03:05:31,112 --> 03:05:39,601
MATT: To buy basic cooking supplies, it wouldn't
be more than 30 gold to restock the entire

2688
03:05:39,601 --> 03:05:42,407
kitchen. It was more other elements of the keep.

2689
03:05:42,407 --> 03:05:44,147
SAM: Including the silverware?

2690
03:05:44,147 --> 03:05:45,018
MATT: Yeah.

2691
03:05:45,018 --> 03:05:46,068
SAM: Oh, great.

2692
03:05:46,068 --> 03:05:49,361
LAURA: It wasn't fancy silverware. It was
utilitarian.

2693
03:05:49,361 --> 03:05:52,625
MATT: It was decent. It was functional. It was
included with the keep.

2694
03:05:52,625 --> 03:05:57,579
SAM: All right, here's 50. Go get us a decent set
of silverware.

2695
03:05:57,579 --> 03:06:02,924
LAURA: And other things. Or send somebody else, if
you'd rather.

2696
03:06:02,924 --> 03:06:07,953
MATT: "I'm not much help around here right now, am
I? All right." And she runs off, returning a short

2697
03:06:08,059 --> 03:06:14,024
time later, with groceries, as well, that she
found while she was out. Makes a fresh meal for

2698
03:06:14,024 --> 03:06:21,552
all of you. Partway through breakfast, there is a
knock at the edge of the dining hall, and you see

2699
03:06:21,552 --> 03:06:29,496
Cordell, your half-orc guardian there. Has his
big, heavy crossbow at his side. "Sorry to bother

2700
03:06:29,496 --> 03:06:34,967
"you while you're eating. You have a messenger who
wishes to speak to you at the front gate."

2701
03:06:34,967 --> 03:06:36,502
LAURA: I'll go.

2702
03:06:36,502 --> 03:06:38,535
MATT: "All right. Follow me."

2703
03:06:38,535 --> 03:06:40,686
SAM: Vax never came home last night?

2704
03:06:40,686 --> 03:06:43,832
MATT: Did you come home? No? Vax has not showed up
yet.

2705
03:06:43,832 --> 03:06:45,384
SAM: Should we be worried?

2706
03:06:45,384 --> 03:06:47,291
TALIESIN: We're going to have to collect him
before we go.

2707
03:06:47,291 --> 03:06:57,246
MATT: As you go to the gate, it's opened up and
you can see there, standing by himself, Seeker

2708
03:06:57,246 --> 03:07:03,446
Asum. Hood back, bald halfling helm with his
tattoos greeting you. He goes, "Hello, Vex."

2709
03:07:03,446 --> 03:07:04,398
LAURA: Hi.

2710
03:07:04,398 --> 03:07:10,473
MATT: "I've come to request your presence at the
Precepts Stage within the Cloudtop District near

2711
03:07:10,473 --> 03:07:13,727
"dusk. All of Vox Machina, this evening, if you
don't mind."

2712
03:07:13,727 --> 03:07:15,523
LAURA: Oh. Well, why?

2713
03:07:15,523 --> 03:07:20,075
MATT: "Uriel and I have been in extensive
discussion these past few days, and the reveal of

2714
03:07:20,075 --> 03:07:25,390
"Riskel's betrayal has had a profound effect on
Uriel, and rumors have been spreading amongst the

2715
03:07:25,390 --> 03:07:32,957
"district and the higher order of the city. Uriel
is to make a statement regarding it and to prevent

2716
03:07:32,957 --> 03:07:38,171
"any political intrigue will talk to the
politically inclined populace first. As members of

2717
03:07:38,171 --> 03:07:45,806
"the council, we would like for you to be there to
help us based on the reaction. If you would be so kind?"

2718
03:07:45,806 --> 03:07:50,654
LAURA: Yes, of course. I'll tell the rest of the
group. We were planning on heading out to

2719
03:07:50,654 --> 03:07:55,432
Whitestone today, but we can put that off if it's
very important?

2720
03:07:55,432 --> 03:07:57,300
MATT: "It's rather important."

2721
03:07:57,300 --> 03:08:03,465
LAURA: All right. What were you guys fighting
about before? Can you tell me?

2722
03:08:03,465 --> 03:08:05,992
MATT: "It's nothing you need to worry about."

2723
03:08:05,992 --> 03:08:07,935
LAURA: Really? It looked kind of serious.

2724
03:08:07,935 --> 03:08:14,556
MATT: "I think tonight's discussion will absolve
any questions you have."

2725
03:08:14,556 --> 03:08:16,759
LAURA: Is anybody in trouble?

2726
03:08:16,759 --> 03:08:20,097
MATT: "No. You're fine. You've done nothing."

2727
03:08:20,097 --> 03:08:21,470
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

2728
03:08:21,470 --> 03:08:23,090
SAM: We should torture him to find out.

2729
03:08:23,090 --> 03:08:25,150
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot off a limb.

2730
03:08:25,150 --> 03:08:29,067
LAURA: 23?

2731
03:08:29,067 --> 03:08:36,130
MATT: 23? He seems fairly forthright and honest.
There is a sense of urgency to him. He's really

2732
03:08:36,130 --> 03:08:37,697
insisting you guys be there.

2733
03:08:37,697 --> 03:08:41,440
LAURA: Okay. Well, we will be, then.

2734
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:45,419
MATT: "Wondrous. I will notify the rest of the
council. I look forward to seeing you this evening."

2735
03:08:45,419 --> 03:08:49,973
LAURA: Yes, if you see my brother anywhere, can
you send him home?

2736
03:08:49,973 --> 03:08:53,632
MATT: "Yeah, I'll keep an eye out. I have a
network in the city. I can probably locate him

2737
03:08:53,632 --> 03:08:55,302
"within the hour, if need be."

2738
03:08:55,302 --> 03:08:56,457
LAURA: Thank you.

2739
03:08:56,457 --> 03:09:03,541
MATT: "No worries." He walks away. As he steps
away, you look for a second. You glance away and

2740
03:09:03,541 --> 03:09:05,770
look back, and he's gone.

2741
03:09:05,770 --> 03:09:09,357
LAURA: He is so sneaky. I need to train with him
more.

2742
03:09:09,357 --> 03:09:10,688
TALIESIN: Like Batman.

2743
03:09:10,688 --> 03:09:14,585
LAURA: I go back and tell everybody what he just
told me.

2744
03:09:14,585 --> 03:09:16,943
SAM: Oh my god!

2745
03:09:16,943 --> 03:09:18,285
LAURA: Right?

2746
03:09:18,285 --> 03:09:20,459
(laughter)

2747
03:09:20,459 --> 03:09:22,523
TALIESIN: I suppose we'll have to put it off for a
day, then.

2748
03:09:22,523 --> 03:09:26,106
SAM: Yes. Is the skull going to be safe here while
we're gone?

2749
03:09:26,106 --> 03:09:27,642
TALIESIN: I think so.

2750
03:09:27,642 --> 03:09:31,904
SAM: Can it see inside our keep? Can it channel
some beast?

2751
03:09:31,904 --> 03:09:35,245
TALIESIN: It's locked very far away right now, in
a very secure room.

2752
03:09:35,245 --> 03:09:37,428
SAM: But not secure magically.

2753
03:09:37,428 --> 03:09:41,817
MARISHA: Yeah. Percy, maybe me and you should make
some reinforcements or something?

2754
03:09:41,817 --> 03:09:44,053
LIAM: It's just radioactive material in the
basement. It's fine.

2755
03:09:44,053 --> 03:09:50,814
SAM: What if it's a portal? What if it can send a
dragon to us, or a worm or something?

2756
03:09:50,814 --> 03:09:55,030
TRAVIS: It did say as long as that house stands,
it will be very powerful.

2757
03:09:55,030 --> 03:10:01,498
TALIESIN: Well, do you think it would be safer
somewhere? Do you think there's something you

2758
03:10:01,498 --> 03:10:04,766
could conjure, perhaps, around it? Or should we
move it to another room?

2759
03:10:04,766 --> 03:10:08,579
LAURA: I feel like your room is very secure.

2760
03:10:08,579 --> 03:10:11,988
TALIESIN: We could always send it straight away to
Whitestone. But...

2761
03:10:11,988 --> 03:10:14,345
MARISHA: But we'd have to put it with someone
else, right?

2762
03:10:14,345 --> 03:10:19,612
TALIESIN: We'd have to let someone take it to
Whitestone. It could be there today. Or we could

2763
03:10:19,612 --> 03:10:23,145
keep it in my room, or we could move it perhaps
into the temple of Sarenrae?

2764
03:10:23,145 --> 03:10:27,873
LAURA: Maybe... how many times can you use that
little tree thing, Keyleth?

2765
03:10:27,873 --> 03:10:29,409
MARISHA: Once a day.

2766
03:10:29,409 --> 03:10:30,533
LAURA: Fuck.

2767
03:10:30,533 --> 03:10:33,493
MARISHA: I know. Or else I would totally run it
over and run it back.

2768
03:10:33,493 --> 03:10:36,221
TALIESIN: Oh. But you can run it over and run
back.

2769
03:10:36,221 --> 03:10:38,265
MARISHA: Oh, if I use your thing?

2770
03:10:38,265 --> 03:10:42,907
SAM: If you, if you go there, take the stone from
his sister and you can come right back.

2771
03:10:42,907 --> 03:10:45,219
LAURA: Yeah, take the stone from his sister and
come back.

2772
03:10:45,219 --> 03:10:46,701
MARISHA: I could.

2773
03:10:46,701 --> 03:10:48,641
LAURA: Let her know it's useless after the one
use.

2774
03:10:48,641 --> 03:10:52,659
SAM: Well, let's not lie to Percy's sister.
(laughs)

2775
03:10:52,659 --> 03:10:56,416
TRAVIS: Is it safe in Whitestone? I mean, the
temple of Sarenrae is at least here.

2776
03:10:56,416 --> 03:11:03,506
LAURA: Got a good idea. What if you go, you don't
take the skull, you tell Allura what's going on,

2777
03:11:03,506 --> 03:11:05,868
bring her back with you through the tree!

2778
03:11:05,868 --> 03:11:09,566
SAM: We keep summoning Allura to solve our magical
problems. We brought her to Whitestone and now

2779
03:11:09,566 --> 03:11:10,924
we're bringing her back?

2780
03:11:10,924 --> 03:11:12,292
LAURA: She's really, really smart!

2781
03:11:12,292 --> 03:11:13,638
SAM: All right...

2782
03:11:13,638 --> 03:11:18,230
LAURA: She can go right back, you can send her
right back.

2783
03:11:18,230 --> 03:11:21,108
MARISHA: What if she doesn't come?

2784
03:11:21,108 --> 03:11:23,908
LAURA: Well, then you come back--

2785
03:11:23,908 --> 03:11:28,073
MARISHA: I'd be using a 6th-level spell as a
glorified messenger? 'Hey, we found a scary skull.'

2786
03:11:28,073 --> 03:11:30,511
SAM: Hey, you used it yesterday for no reason,
too.

2787
03:11:30,511 --> 03:11:35,032
(laughter)

2788
03:11:35,032 --> 03:11:37,332
TALIESIN: Wow! Oh my god.

2789
03:11:37,332 --> 03:11:40,668
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) The sickest burn. That's
the sickest burn! Oh fuck!

2790
03:11:40,668 --> 03:11:46,118
TALIESIN: And somehow the coffee has not been
poured on your head. That's the greatest magic

2791
03:11:46,118 --> 03:11:52,456
trick I've seen all night. How are you still dry?
It's witchcraft.

2792
03:11:52,456 --> 03:11:56,376
MARISHA: You know what, Scanlan, why don't you
figure out how to get the damn skull back to

2793
03:11:56,376 --> 03:11:58,507
Whitestone by yourself, how's that?

2794
03:11:58,507 --> 03:12:04,295
TALIESIN: Why don't we just let it be in the room
for now-- Let's let it be in the room for now,

2795
03:12:04,295 --> 03:12:05,947
nothing happened last night.

2796
03:12:05,947 --> 03:12:09,773
MARISHA: Nothing happened last night, but it seems
like a ticking time bomb.

2797
03:12:09,773 --> 03:12:17,687
TALIESIN: I'm going down, I have to go get my
things anyway, so I'm going to go down. Everything

2798
03:12:17,687 --> 03:12:19,189
seems fine, doesn't it?

2799
03:12:19,189 --> 03:12:21,719
MATT: Untampered, room seems left as it was.

2800
03:12:21,719 --> 03:12:23,624
LAURA: It doesn't seem tampered with at all, the
door?

2801
03:12:23,624 --> 03:12:33,064
TALIESIN: The door is steel reinforced, lined and
bolted to the wall; it's not going anywhere. This

2802
03:12:33,064 --> 03:12:36,193
room is designed to explode.

2803
03:12:36,193 --> 03:12:41,056
MARISHA: I mean, I could-- all right.

2804
03:12:41,056 --> 03:12:43,556
LAURA: Maybe we should make sure there's, like,
fabric over it.

2805
03:12:43,556 --> 03:12:45,871
TALIESIN: It's hidden in the room.

2806
03:12:45,871 --> 03:12:47,620
TRAVIS: Maybe we should go in and check on it.

2807
03:12:47,620 --> 03:12:51,721
MARISHA: I could Wall Of Stone another kind of box
around it.

2808
03:12:51,721 --> 03:12:58,043
TALIESIN: I go into the room, I shut the door
behind me. I check my hiding place.

2809
03:12:58,043 --> 03:13:00,181
MATT: Untouched.

2810
03:13:00,181 --> 03:13:04,432
TALIESIN: And it's untouched and perfectly
reasonable. I return it to my hiding place. Which,

2811
03:13:04,432 --> 03:13:09,498
if I have to reveal it later, I will happily tell
you where it's hidden. Shut and lock the door

2812
03:13:09,498 --> 03:13:11,289
behind me. Everything's fine.

2813
03:13:11,289 --> 03:13:15,330
TRAVIS: That's a relief.

2814
03:13:15,330 --> 03:13:17,459
TALIESIN: Let's find your brother.

2815
03:13:17,459 --> 03:13:20,407
MARISHA: All right. I guess we're staying in
town.

2816
03:13:20,407 --> 03:13:21,959
SAM: We're leaving the skull?

2817
03:13:21,959 --> 03:13:23,306
MARISHA: Seems okay.

2818
03:13:23,306 --> 03:13:25,284
SAM: (laughing) Let's at least post Jarett here.

2819
03:13:25,284 --> 03:13:26,927
MARISHA: Yeah, let's post someone here, I guess.

2820
03:13:26,927 --> 03:13:31,398
MATT: Jarett's already, by the way, off to the
side listening to this whole conversation.

2821
03:13:31,398 --> 03:13:33,101
SAM: Do you ever sleep, Jarett?

2822
03:13:33,101 --> 03:13:38,016
MATT: "I sleep when I'm not needed. But it seems
right now I am needed, and I am more than happy to

2823
03:13:38,016 --> 03:13:39,459
"stand guard. It's what you pay me for."

2824
03:13:39,459 --> 03:13:40,522
SAM: You're so cool.

2825
03:13:40,522 --> 03:13:42,006
LAURA: You're seriously the coolest guy.

2826
03:13:42,006 --> 03:13:43,341
MARISHA: Yeah, you're great.

2827
03:13:43,341 --> 03:13:45,826
MATT: "You're being absolutely ridiculous.
Continue."

2828
03:13:45,826 --> 03:13:47,713
(laughter)

2829
03:13:47,713 --> 03:13:49,715
TALIESIN: If anything strange happens, make note
of it.

2830
03:13:49,715 --> 03:13:50,771
MATT: "Of course."

2831
03:13:50,771 --> 03:13:51,913
MARISHA: Don't let anyone in or out.

2832
03:13:51,913 --> 03:13:53,474
TALIESIN: Well, he can't, he doesn't have the key
anyway.

2833
03:13:53,474 --> 03:13:54,778
MATT: "No. This is true."

2834
03:13:54,778 --> 03:13:55,929
MARISHA: I'm just saying.

2835
03:13:55,929 --> 03:13:56,876
MATT: "It'll be done."

2836
03:13:56,876 --> 03:13:57,671
MARISHA: All right.

2837
03:13:57,671 --> 03:13:58,403
MATT: "All right."

2838
03:13:58,403 --> 03:13:59,100
MARISHA: Okay?

2839
03:13:59,100 --> 03:13:59,864
MATT: "Okay."

2840
03:13:59,864 --> 03:14:00,918
LAURA: We need to give him a raise.

2841
03:14:00,918 --> 03:14:02,127
MATT: "Yes, you do."

2842
03:14:02,127 --> 03:14:05,369
SAM: Why don't you just take it from my money?

2843
03:14:05,369 --> 03:14:10,197
TALIESIN: I throw ten gold at him right now, just
in lieu of-- I throw ten gold.

2844
03:14:10,197 --> 03:14:13,165
MATT: "Very generous of you, Percival."

2845
03:14:13,165 --> 03:14:14,494
TALIESIN: It's the very least.

2846
03:14:14,494 --> 03:14:20,063
MATT: And he sets up his chair in the far corner,
staring at the door again, and sets his crossbow

2847
03:14:20,063 --> 03:14:22,605
over his shoulder and just sits waiting.

2848
03:14:22,605 --> 03:14:25,093
TALIESIN: Let's go find your brother.

2849
03:14:25,093 --> 03:14:28,727
MATT: Now, Vax, what are you up to?

2850
03:14:28,727 --> 03:14:36,769
LIAM: I mean, I'm assuming-- I didn't go there to
find anything, but I went just to think, and I

2851
03:14:36,769 --> 03:14:38,747
didn't see anything by chance, no?

2852
03:14:38,747 --> 03:14:45,139
MATT: Nope. You detect no movement inside
whatsoever. Dark windows over the course of the

2853
03:14:45,139 --> 03:14:49,708
evening, no sign.

2854
03:14:55,068 --> 03:14:58,167
LIAM: All right, well, I guess I'll go back to the
keep.

2855
03:14:58,167 --> 03:14:59,962
MATT: Okay.

2856
03:14:59,962 --> 03:15:08,375
LIAM: And I will sit up. No one's there? I'll sit
up in my sister's room.

2857
03:15:08,391 --> 03:15:12,680
MATT: All right. Well, as you guys are walking
back--

2858
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:15,144
LIAM: Stealth, please. I'm not walking in the
open.

2859
03:15:15,342 --> 03:15:19,381
MATT: All right, make a stealth check.

2860
03:15:19,381 --> 03:15:20,703
LIAM: 27.

2861
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:26,030
MATT: 27? All right. All of you that are out
looking for him, make a perception check.

2862
03:15:31,287 --> 03:15:34,209
MARISHA: 29.

2863
03:15:34,209 --> 03:15:35,753
TALIESIN: 18.

2864
03:15:35,753 --> 03:15:39,610
MATT: As you guys spend a good portion of the
morning scouting about the usual paths that you

2865
03:15:39,610 --> 03:15:45,277
take as a group, knowing the back alleys and the
various paths that you walk through Emon to ensure

2866
03:15:45,277 --> 03:15:55,362
that you avoid the main thoroughfares and the
most-used walkways, as you're glancing about you

2867
03:15:55,480 --> 03:16:01,331
see a quick shadow shift past about the size of
the individual you are seeking.

2868
03:16:01,331 --> 03:16:06,071
TALIESIN: (puffs air) Sorry.

2869
03:16:06,071 --> 03:16:11,251
MATT: You look over and you see Vax dart off
around the corner and dodge down an alleyway.

2870
03:16:11,251 --> 03:16:14,617
MARISHA: Vax? Vax!

2871
03:16:14,617 --> 03:16:18,945
MATT: You faintly hear Keyleth's voice behind
you.

2872
03:16:18,945 --> 03:16:25,572
LIAM: Not now, Kiki. And I just keep going.

2873
03:16:25,572 --> 03:16:28,493
LAURA: Did you find him?

2874
03:16:28,493 --> 03:16:31,258
MARISHA: Nope.

2875
03:16:32,768 --> 03:16:34,316
LAURA: Vax!

2876
03:16:34,316 --> 03:16:39,594
MATT: You guys spend the better part of the day
searching for him. Asking questions, nobody has an

2877
03:16:39,594 --> 03:16:43,890
idea. A few individuals try and squeeze some gold
out of you. You eventually manage to gather they

2878
03:16:43,890 --> 03:16:49,722
have no idea what they're talking about. By about
early afternoon, two o'clock in the afternoon, you

2879
03:16:49,722 --> 03:16:52,201
eventually make your way back to the keep,
figuring that he'll find his way back if he

2880
03:16:52,201 --> 03:16:58,922
doesn't want to be found. Upon arrival, the guards
also haven't seen him. But once you go up to your

2881
03:16:58,922 --> 03:17:09,312
room to get into more comfortable attire, your
brother is sitting inside your room, waiting.

2882
03:17:09,312 --> 03:17:14,744
LAURA: Well, there you are. What's going on?

2883
03:17:14,744 --> 03:17:16,929
LIAM: Look, everything's fine. All right?

2884
03:17:16,929 --> 03:17:18,599
LAURA: I believe you. Fully.

2885
03:17:18,599 --> 03:17:23,763
LIAM: Everything's fine. I just don't know what
we're doing, anymore.

2886
03:17:23,763 --> 03:17:25,088
LAURA: What do you mean?

2887
03:17:25,088 --> 03:17:31,265
LIAM: I don't know what we're doing, I don't know
why we're doing it. I don't know! I've just been

2888
03:17:31,265 --> 03:17:36,855
thinking about it, I mean, what is the point of
our lives?

2889
03:17:36,855 --> 03:17:40,126
LAURA: Well, that's a very deep question.

2890
03:17:40,126 --> 03:17:47,503
LIAM: Yeah. It's fine, let's go. I don't know what
I missed. I can go wherever everybody wants to go.

2891
03:17:47,503 --> 03:17:58,688
LAURA: No. (sigh) Sit down! Seems like a problem
in your mind. Are you mad because we're stealing

2892
03:17:58,688 --> 03:18:04,885
gold? Are you mad because everybody's running off
in directions and you can't keep up? Are you mad

2893
03:18:04,885 --> 03:18:07,516
because you almost died?

2894
03:18:07,516 --> 03:18:17,758
LIAM: No. When it was just you and me, I knew what
we were doing. We were just trying to survive.

2895
03:18:17,758 --> 03:18:23,062
LAURA: Right! That's really all we're doing now,
just on a grander scale.

2896
03:18:23,062 --> 03:18:28,881
LIAM: (sighs) We're running into this shit on
purpose now. Which is all right, when there's

2897
03:18:28,881 --> 03:18:36,935
reason. I don't always know why we're doing the
things we do. It was fun, breaking into that

2898
03:18:36,935 --> 03:18:38,802
house. I'm good at it!

2899
03:18:38,802 --> 03:18:40,069
LAURA: Yes, you are.

2900
03:18:40,069 --> 03:18:45,708
LIAM: I don't know why we did it! I don't know why
I'm working with a large fucking beast of a man

2901
03:18:45,708 --> 03:18:51,801
who seems to despise me. Day after day.

2902
03:18:51,801 --> 03:18:53,642
LAURA: He doesn't despise you.

2903
03:18:53,642 --> 03:18:57,278
LIAM: The fuck he doesn't. I don't know why we're
doing it. I don't know why we're with most of

2904
03:18:57,278 --> 03:19:01,899
these people! And I love these people, but I don't
know why we're doing it! And I just want you to

2905
03:19:01,899 --> 03:19:08,246
think about a little bit too. And I walk out the
door.

2906
03:19:14,956 --> 03:19:16,661
LAURA: I get ready for the evening.

2907
03:19:16,661 --> 03:19:23,946
MATT: Okay. As the sun draws across the sky,
pushing towards dusk as the light blue begins to

2908
03:19:23,946 --> 03:19:33,335
turn to a somewhat purplish-orange hue, you all
gather your materials, whatever attire you wish to

2909
03:19:33,335 --> 03:19:41,600
bring, and make your way towards the Cloudtop
District. Anyone wish to do anything else?

2910
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,954
LIAM: I'm going through my vast array of cloaks.

2911
03:19:43,954 --> 03:19:45,894
(laughter)

2912
03:19:45,894 --> 03:19:53,447
LIAM: And I'm taking the other one. And putting
of all my many two cloaks, I'm going to put

2913
03:19:53,447 --> 03:19:57,981
the other one on.

2914
03:19:57,981 --> 03:19:59,458
MATT: All right.

2915
03:19:59,458 --> 03:20:05,306
SAM: Can I swing by Gilmore's and just see if he
or-- Sherri works there?

2916
03:20:05,306 --> 03:20:06,873
MATT: Sherri works there.

2917
03:20:06,873 --> 03:20:09,795
SAM: Sherri works there, if they're around?

2918
03:20:09,795 --> 03:20:17,704
MATT: Going to ask. Sherri kinda greets you as you
enter and goes, "Hello, Scanlan. Gilmore is back

2919
03:20:17,704 --> 03:20:23,517
"in Westruun, weeks away from opening his new
establishment, but can I help you?"

2920
03:20:23,517 --> 03:20:30,520
SAM: Two things. One, when he returns, he made me
a potion, a while back. I'm running a bit low. It

2921
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:37,621
was a scrying sort of thing. When he gets back,
maybe he can whip me up another batch for next

2922
03:20:37,621 --> 03:20:41,473
time I come pay a visit, but also-- oh, yes?

2923
03:20:41,473 --> 03:20:45,085
MATT: She puts up her hand for a second and walks
off through the beaded curtains in the back, and

2924
03:20:45,085 --> 03:20:47,020
comes back with Gilmore.

2925
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:50,640
SAM: Oh!

2926
03:20:50,640 --> 03:20:58,358
MATT: Gilmore steps forth. "Terribly sorry,
Scanlan, trying to keep business right now kind of

2927
03:20:58,358 --> 03:21:05,087
"on the DL. There's a special event tonight." And
you see how dressed up he is. "I imagine, being

2928
03:21:05,087 --> 03:21:07,111
"part of the council, you're probably invited
too."

2929
03:21:07,111 --> 03:21:09,047
SAM: Yes, I was just going there now.

2930
03:21:09,047 --> 03:21:11,007
MATT: "Oh, well, I'll accompany you!"

2931
03:21:11,007 --> 03:21:13,993
SAM: All right, we'll save business for another
day.

2932
03:21:13,993 --> 03:21:15,809
MATT: "Well, what business did you have?"

2933
03:21:15,809 --> 03:21:23,365
SAM: I just wondered-- I may want to try to find
someone at some point tonight. I don't know how.

2934
03:21:23,365 --> 03:21:27,009
MATT: "Hmm, scrying. We've had this conversation
before."

2935
03:21:27,009 --> 03:21:31,164
SAM: Yes, but a different sort, a less fecal
sort.

2936
03:21:31,164 --> 03:21:35,419
MATT: "Not going to lie, I'm very glad to hear
that."

2937
03:21:35,419 --> 03:21:38,329
LIAM: Fecal matters.

2938
03:21:38,329 --> 03:21:45,837
SAM: I don't know how to scry, I don't know how to
find someone or what I need. I may have a hair

2939
03:21:45,837 --> 03:21:48,745
strand or two, but I don't have much to go on.

2940
03:21:48,745 --> 03:21:51,583
MATT: "That should be plenty. If I can't help you,
I know a few that might be able to."

2941
03:21:51,583 --> 03:21:52,425
SAM: All right.

2942
03:21:52,425 --> 03:21:56,197
MATT: "But! Nevertheless." And he adjusts his
collar and he's very, very well dressed in his

2943
03:21:56,214 --> 03:22:04,336
long, deep navy robes, a high collar that nips at
the side of his neck. "Shall we?"

2944
03:22:04,336 --> 03:22:08,230
SAM: Absolutely. You lead!

2945
03:22:08,230 --> 03:22:09,756
MATT: He leads you out towards the Cloudtop.

2946
03:22:09,756 --> 03:22:12,033
TRAVIS: Could I have also gone to Gilmore's?

2947
03:22:12,033 --> 03:22:13,038
MATT: If you'd like to.

2948
03:22:13,038 --> 03:22:15,769
SAM: Oh! Oh, Grog! Oh, Jesus!

2949
03:22:15,769 --> 03:22:19,556
TRAVIS: No no no, just, we go in together and when
he's talking to Gilmore, I find one of the lesser

2950
03:22:19,556 --> 03:22:27,967
clerks and I say: Do you sell lockpicks here?

2951
03:22:27,967 --> 03:22:35,323
MATT: The other clerk is probably a new hire, you
haven't seen him here before. Young, early 20s,

2952
03:22:35,323 --> 03:22:43,065
very, very thin hair, kind of waify. "Lockpicks?
This isn't--"

2953
03:22:43,065 --> 03:22:47,277
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know. I keep locking myself in
the shitter and I'm really tired of asking people

2954
03:22:47,277 --> 03:22:49,283
to come let me out. It's really--

2955
03:22:49,283 --> 03:22:53,777
MATT: "I wish I could help. Those are outlawed,
I'm sorry. That's not really--"

2956
03:22:53,777 --> 03:22:58,447
TRAVIS: Look, I've got these huge clumsy-fuck
hands. Is there anything you could give me, maybe

2957
03:22:58,447 --> 03:23:04,543
magical, that would just keep me from being
embarrassed in front of my friends? It smells so

2958
03:23:04,543 --> 03:23:08,096
bad and then they all come and the door opens and
it's just awful!

2959
03:23:08,096 --> 03:23:12,639
MATT: As you're getting closer and closer to him,
this, looming goliath who's feigning fear and

2960
03:23:12,639 --> 03:23:18,080
worry in his face, the guy just retracts. "I'm
sorry! I don't-- We're closing shop!"

2961
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:20,277
TRAVIS: No, do you have like a wand or a potion or
like, a thing--

2962
03:23:20,277 --> 03:23:23,238
MATT: "Good night!" And he runs up the stairs to
the second floor.

2963
03:23:23,238 --> 03:23:24,447
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

2964
03:23:24,447 --> 03:23:30,392
(laughter)

2965
03:23:30,392 --> 03:23:38,845
TRAVIS: Lovely goods you have here. I'll let
myself out.

2966
03:23:38,845 --> 03:23:43,838
MATT: "We'll come with you don't worry!" He puts
his other arm out.

2967
03:23:43,838 --> 03:23:46,645
TRAVIS: All right.

2968
03:23:46,645 --> 03:23:47,746
MATT: The three of you arm in arm.

2969
03:23:47,746 --> 03:23:49,048
LIAM: He's currently like this.

2970
03:23:49,048 --> 03:23:50,512
MATT: Yeah! He's, like, lifted.

2971
03:23:50,512 --> 03:23:51,971
SAM: It's the Wizard of Oz!

2972
03:23:51,971 --> 03:24:00,144
MATT: Yeah! You skip along, the rest of you make
your way to the Cloudtop, and you make your way

2973
03:24:00,144 --> 03:24:05,386
around the stage and it's against the wall, near
one of the entrances to the Cloudtop, but on the

2974
03:24:05,386 --> 03:24:11,273
interior. And you can see there is a rather large
stage up against the wall. There is already a

2975
03:24:11,273 --> 03:24:16,657
crowd gathered. You see merchants, highborn
families, political guests, upper-station

2976
03:24:16,657 --> 03:24:23,163
military, a number of well-dressed representatives
from all over Emon have gathered for this. You

2977
03:24:23,163 --> 03:24:27,576
guys meet up with the rest of the group and you
kind of, you know, gravitate. Gilmore gives

2978
03:24:27,576 --> 03:24:35,187
everyone a quick wave and gives you a respectful
nod. "Aha! Yes!" and he wanders off and starts

2979
03:24:35,187 --> 03:24:44,482
mingling with some of the other guests. Just as
the sun vanishes beneath the distant horizon, a

2980
03:24:44,482 --> 03:24:52,821
procession of palace guards approach the area, the
crowd parting, as Uriel arrives with the escort,

2981
03:24:52,821 --> 03:24:57,878
flanked by his family, and the current inner
council of Tal'Dorei with Arbiter Brom, Seeker

2982
03:24:57,878 --> 03:25:05,035
Asum, Tofor Brotorus. Allura is absent of course,
for being in Whitestone. They all step onto the

2983
03:25:05,035 --> 03:25:11,519
stage along with the guards as well, as cheers and
light applause begins to break out. Not crazy go

2984
03:25:11,519 --> 03:25:13,394
wild, but just like (muted) "Hooray."

2985
03:25:13,394 --> 03:25:14,406
MARISHA: Rich people clapping, sure.

2986
03:25:14,406 --> 03:25:15,934
MATT: Yeah, you know.

2987
03:25:17,425 --> 03:25:23,238
MATT: Guards have already set up
a few chairs on the stage. Uriel begins to sit on

2988
03:25:23,238 --> 03:25:29,018
one as his family gathers behind it, and he puts
his hand out and motions to everybody to go ahead

2989
03:25:29,018 --> 03:25:41,529
and hush down. As he does, he stands up from his
chair. "Friends and family. Allies of this fair

2990
03:25:41,529 --> 03:25:51,315
"city of Emon. Houses-in-arms to the Tal'Dorei
family. Guests, guardians and law-keepers alike. I

2991
03:25:51,315 --> 03:25:57,731
"thank you for coming on such short notice. Now, it
has not escaped me that talk spreads quickly

2992
03:25:57,731 --> 03:26:08,713
"within these walls, and rumors only seek to
undermine trust. It is true Lord Riskel Daxio,

2993
03:26:08,713 --> 03:26:15,733
"honored member of our council and overseer of
development within Emon for many years, has

2994
03:26:15,733 --> 03:26:23,569
"unfortunately passed away. We mourn our friend,
and ask you all to respect his legacy enough to

2995
03:26:23,569 --> 03:26:33,357
"not to smear his name. That being said, this was
just one of many hardships that has befallen our

2996
03:26:33,357 --> 03:26:43,093
"council and my family this past year. Many that
have left me with a terrible burden. We've been

2997
03:26:43,093 --> 03:26:52,777
"faced with deceit, and I failed to see it. We've
been beset with allies in need, and I have been

2998
03:26:52,777 --> 03:27:00,764
"noncommittal in aiding them. We've been clouded by
demonic powers, and I've failed to protect my

2999
03:27:00,764 --> 03:27:11,503
"family. And my responsibility to all of you. I
look back at my bloodline, at my father and his

3000
03:27:11,503 --> 03:27:20,491
"father before him, and I plainly see what I am
not. These times are different. This wonderful

3001
03:27:20,491 --> 03:27:29,396
"city has grown these past centuries into something
grand: a beacon of civilization, here in these

3002
03:27:29,396 --> 03:27:39,505
"lands that my ancestors gave name to. My family
has built us up, and I feel that there is little

3003
03:27:39,505 --> 03:27:50,712
"more my family can accomplish for the greatness of
these lands. It has outgrown our meager guidance.

3004
03:27:50,712 --> 03:27:58,347
"I did not choose to be your sovereign; it was by
blood that I came into this. And I did my very,

3005
03:27:58,414 --> 03:28:09,983
"very best to live up to your expectations. I can
see the future of you all and I wish to safeguard

3006
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:23,011
"it, by leaving it not in one hand, but the hands
of many. As of the end of this week, I will be

3007
03:28:23,011 --> 03:28:29,806
"stepping down as your sovereign. The Tal'Dorei
bloodline will no longer hold the fate of this

3008
03:28:29,855 --> 03:28:39,248
"realm. We will instead leave the council to rule."
And he looks about at the other council members,

3009
03:28:39,248 --> 03:28:48,882
on out to you, out to the rest of the group.
"There will be a chosen few, exemplary members of

3010
03:28:48,882 --> 03:29:00,033
"our society, who will step up and aid in this
task, and join the council as well. You, the

3011
03:29:00,033 --> 03:29:09,221
"peoples of Emon, will be the ones to guide us to a
new age of prosperity." At this point now the

3012
03:29:09,221 --> 03:29:12,710
claps come in again and some cheers happen.
There's a little bit of confusion in the crowd,

3013
03:29:12,710 --> 03:29:18,717
but for the most part everyone seems to be into
it. At this moment, one of the guards hurries up

3014
03:29:18,717 --> 03:29:24,488
the side of the stage and, you notice, whispers
something into Asum's ear, who leans over and

3015
03:29:24,488 --> 03:29:29,101
gives a nod and worried expression. Vex.

3016
03:29:29,101 --> 03:29:36,268
LAURA: (giggles) Yay!

3017
03:29:40,618 --> 03:29:47,330
SAM: (radio DJ voice) Don't forget to subscribe to
Geek and Sundry, so you can see archives of

3018
03:29:47,330 --> 03:29:52,582
the show and many others! I don't even know--

3019
03:29:52,582 --> 03:29:54,003
LAURA: Wait.

3020
03:29:54,003 --> 03:30:03,102
TRAVIS: It's hard, right? When one ear's in and
one ear's out, it's tough. I was trying to plug it.

3021
03:30:03,102 --> 03:30:06,681
SAM: Remember, Liam doesn't really hate Travis in
real life!

3022
03:30:06,681 --> 03:30:09,360
(laughter)

3023
03:30:09,360 --> 03:30:14,962
LAURA: Wait, wait. As soon as I notice
that, I touch Grog and Vax's shoulders

3024
03:30:14,962 --> 03:30:18,756
and I point up really fast.

3025
03:30:18,756 --> 03:30:23,228
MATT: You look up and-- you guys all gather this
as well. You can see, piercing out of some of the

3026
03:30:23,228 --> 03:30:28,409
cloud cover above, what looks to be two
fast-moving streaks of color, black and red. They

3027
03:30:28,409 --> 03:30:31,683
just-- (whoosh). And then you can't see them any
more.

3028
03:30:31,683 --> 03:30:36,913
LAURA: Could I tell from my favored enemy-ness
that it was dragons?

3029
03:30:36,913 --> 03:30:42,219
MATT: You can make a hefty perception check if you
like to see exactly how much detail you can make out.

3030
03:30:42,219 --> 03:30:45,335
TRAVIS: Can I look up, too?

3031
03:30:45,335 --> 03:30:48,879
MATT: No. I'm giving her this because of her
really high perception.

3032
03:30:48,879 --> 03:30:50,519
LAURA: No, that was wrong. 23.

3033
03:30:50,519 --> 03:30:55,206
MATT: 23. It's hard to make out details from this
distance. They're moving quick.

3034
03:30:55,206 --> 03:30:57,444
LAURA: One black and one red?

3035
03:30:57,444 --> 03:31:06,414
MATT: Uriel now goes, "I am beyond confident that
all doubts in the capabilities of those I leave

3036
03:31:06,464 --> 03:31:13,384
"the city to, and more--" And it's at this point
you start hearing bells going off around the city.

3037
03:31:13,384 --> 03:31:17,794
Tops of walls in the distance. You recognize
these. These are warning bells. At which point the

3038
03:31:17,794 --> 03:31:22,857
crowd starts murmuring and getting nervous, and
Uriel puts his hand out. "Please, please. I--"

3039
03:31:22,857 --> 03:31:27,123
LAURA: Can I use my Primeval Awareness to see if
it's actually dragons close by?

3040
03:31:27,123 --> 03:31:32,471
MATT: Okay. You begin to concentrate on that for
the moment. Asum now steps up and says, "Everyone,

3041
03:31:32,471 --> 03:31:37,586
"if I might ask you to all quickly make your way to
your respective homes. There is a small emergency

3042
03:31:37,586 --> 03:31:44,726
"we must attend to." At this point, you guys hear
this (whoosh) sound and you turn around just in

3043
03:31:44,726 --> 03:31:52,387
time to see what looks to be a large, larger than
you've seen before, white dragon just slam into the

3044
03:31:52,387 --> 03:31:57,988
side of Allura's tower in the distance. Claws
clunk into the side, digging into the stonework,

3045
03:31:57,988 --> 03:32:03,402
wings unfurled, it looks into the upper window of
where her actual parlor is and peeks in for a

3046
03:32:03,402 --> 03:32:13,470
second before just unleashing a blast of icy cold
magical breath into the inside of the tower. You

3047
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:17,724
can see now, screams start tearing around you as
the guards start getting their weapons ready. At

3048
03:32:17,724 --> 03:32:23,708
which point, the dragon pulls its head back and
looks about at everyone screaming, and pushes off

3049
03:32:23,766 --> 03:32:28,898
the tower. As it does you see the stonework crack,
and the top of Allura's tower shatter--

3050
03:32:28,898 --> 03:32:30,132
LAURA: Oh, my god!

3051
03:32:30,132 --> 03:32:34,420
MATT: -- and then begin to collapse, smashing into
the city streets around you. At which point, the

3052
03:32:34,420 --> 03:32:41,948
dragon (wingbeats) and takes off again above you.
At this point in time: utter chaos has been

3053
03:32:41,948 --> 03:32:46,794
unleashed, and you can see now the guards are
rushing Uriel off the table. You guys are there

3054
03:32:46,794 --> 03:32:57,325
caught amongst this chaos. At this very moment, as
the white dragon heads deeper into the city, you

3055
03:32:57,325 --> 03:33:06,627
hear a loud impact that silences the chaotic air
around you, as the wall that the stage is

3056
03:33:06,627 --> 03:33:14,693
buttressed up against now has perched above it an
enormous vision of death: a grinning ancient green

3057
03:33:14,693 --> 03:33:21,049
dragon. Its wings are curled around its form as it
looks down at the rest of you in the middle of

3058
03:33:21,049 --> 03:33:29,692
this open space and goes, "Delicious cattle.
Raishan enjoys the taste of fear."

3059
03:33:29,692 --> 03:33:31,140
LAURA AND MARISHA: Raishan?

3060
03:33:31,140 --> 03:33:36,951
MATT: At which point it leaps down onto the stage,
crushing part of it. I would like you all to roll initiative.

3061
03:33:36,951 --> 03:33:40,005
MARISHA: No, what?!

3062
03:33:40,005 --> 03:33:43,861
SAM: We can't fight four dragons. Can we?

3063
03:33:43,861 --> 03:33:45,812
MARISHA: Wait, did you say four? He didn't say
four.

3064
03:33:45,812 --> 03:33:48,322
LAURA and SAM: There's a red and a black, a white
and a green.

3065
03:33:48,322 --> 03:33:49,754
TRAVIS: Are the red and black dragons?

3066
03:33:49,754 --> 03:33:51,447
LAURA: They were red and black-- of course they
were fucking dragons!

3067
03:33:51,447 --> 03:33:52,512
TRAVIS: You're sure?

3068
03:33:52,512 --> 03:33:56,219
LAURA: Everything else was dragons; why wouldn't
it be dragons?

3069
03:33:56,219 --> 03:33:58,110
TALIESIN: For the love of God and all that is
holy.

3070
03:33:58,110 --> 03:34:01,575
MARISHA: Oh Jesus Christ, Taliesin.

3071
03:34:01,575 --> 03:34:06,379
LAURA: Are we fighting something now?

3072
03:34:06,379 --> 03:34:07,490
MARISHA: Are we just fighting one?

3073
03:34:07,490 --> 03:34:09,231
SAM: Oh, hi, dragon!

3074
03:34:09,231 --> 03:34:14,453
LAURA: Oh, hi, dragon, you're my favourite
customer.

3075
03:34:14,453 --> 03:34:19,202
MATT: Grog and Vex were there. Percy was here.
Pike was here.

3076
03:34:19,202 --> 03:34:21,458
SAM: Don't worry, I'll kill it with music.

3077
03:34:21,458 --> 03:34:23,350
MARISHA: Holy balls!

3078
03:34:23,350 --> 03:34:33,065
MATT: And this is the chaotic pattern of
individuals amongst here.

3079
03:34:33,065 --> 03:34:35,745
SAM: My god, look at all those fuckers!

3080
03:34:35,745 --> 03:34:48,882
MATT: All right! Now, if I could go ahead and have
the initiative scores from you guys. 25 to 20?

3081
03:34:48,882 --> 03:34:50,405
TRAVIS: 20 again.

3082
03:34:50,405 --> 03:34:59,797
MATT: Anybody else? All right. Okay. 20 to 15?

3083
03:34:59,797 --> 03:35:00,775
LIAM: 15 again.

3084
03:35:00,775 --> 03:35:02,206
MARISHA: 15 as well.

3085
03:35:02,206 --> 03:35:07,409
MATT: All right. Ten to five?

3086
03:35:07,409 --> 03:35:08,453
LAURA: 14.

3087
03:35:08,453 --> 03:35:10,675
MATT: Oh, 14, sorry. 14.

3088
03:35:10,675 --> 03:35:12,913
SAM: 13.

3089
03:35:12,913 --> 03:35:18,957
MATT: Scanlan, Pike is after you. Percy, what did
you get?

3090
03:35:18,957 --> 03:35:20,321
TALIESIN: Nine.

3091
03:35:20,321 --> 03:35:22,041
MATT: All right.

3092
03:35:22,041 --> 03:35:25,530
LAURA: The castle looks really badass. It's just
off of camera.

3093
03:35:25,530 --> 03:35:35,419
MATT: Is it? Let me see if I can scoot this
forward a little bit for you guys. Now. Top of the

3094
03:35:35,419 --> 03:35:37,026
round, Grog you're up.

3095
03:35:37,026 --> 03:35:39,119
LAURA: Are we really fighting this right now?

3096
03:35:39,119 --> 03:35:42,846
MATT: Right there. You're right there, where the
red base is.

3097
03:35:42,846 --> 03:35:44,208
LAURA: What's happening?

3098
03:35:44,208 --> 03:35:45,554
MARISHA: I dunno, what the fuck do we do?

3099
03:35:45,554 --> 03:35:52,502
TRAVIS: Well, I only do one thing-- (yelling) I go
into a rage! And a frenzied rage! And I take out

3100
03:35:52,502 --> 03:35:57,565
Craven Edge, and I say, how do you feel about
dragon?

3101
03:35:57,565 --> 03:36:01,214
MATT: "I think it sounds delicious; let's try a
taste."

3102
03:36:01,214 --> 03:36:05,556
TRAVIS: (laughs) Great Weapon Master-- I run up to
the dragon and hack away!

3103
03:36:05,556 --> 03:36:07,863
MATT: All right, make your strikes.

3104
03:36:07,863 --> 03:36:13,200
TRAVIS: All right, fucking hell, where's that son
of a bitch? 19.

3105
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:17,665
MATT: 19 misses.

3106
03:36:17,665 --> 03:36:18,769
SAM: 19 misses?

3107
03:36:18,769 --> 03:36:19,505
MATT: Yes.

3108
03:36:19,505 --> 03:36:20,448
TRAVIS: Everybody hear that?

3109
03:36:20,448 --> 03:36:21,413
MARISHA: Dragon.

3110
03:36:21,413 --> 03:36:23,180
TRAVIS: 22.

3111
03:36:23,180 --> 03:36:25,126
MATT: Just barely hits.

3112
03:36:25,126 --> 03:36:29,693
MARISHA: It has an AC of 22. It's some bullshit.

3113
03:36:29,693 --> 03:36:30,645
TRAVIS: (mutters) That'll miss.

3114
03:36:30,645 --> 03:36:32,379
SAM: Wait, how do I do anything to it?

3115
03:36:32,379 --> 03:36:39,858
MATT: Vex, you are familiar with dragons, as one
of your enemies. Only the most ancient and

3116
03:36:39,858 --> 03:36:47,789
powerful of dragons ever reach this size.
Chromatic dragons are very selfish entities and do

3117
03:36:47,789 --> 03:36:52,694
not usually work with individuals of other color
patterns. The fact that this is this coordinated

3118
03:36:52,694 --> 03:36:59,619
between multiple is a very, very bad sign. You're
suddenly brought back to a singular moment in your

3119
03:36:59,619 --> 03:37:02,889
past when you recall seeing four orbs embedded in
a wall.

3120
03:37:02,889 --> 03:37:06,790
LAURA: Yeah, no, I think we-- We brought this on
ourselves.

3121
03:37:06,790 --> 03:37:08,998
LIAM: Chickens come home to roost.

3122
03:37:08,998 --> 03:37:11,354
MATT: So, Grog, damage on the one strike?

3123
03:37:11,359 --> 03:37:15,570
TRAVIS: Just on the one. Oh, yeah right, I'm sorry
I was so caught up in the fact that I'm just

3124
03:37:15,570 --> 03:37:18,443
literally going up against death incarnate-- hey!

3125
03:37:18,443 --> 03:37:20,854
MARISHA: We had no fucking reason to go into that
basement.

3126
03:37:20,854 --> 03:37:21,976
TRAVIS: 19.

3127
03:37:21,976 --> 03:37:29,860
MATT: 19? Okay, 19 damage, good to know. All
right, that ends your turn. First, it is Raishan.

3128
03:37:29,860 --> 03:37:41,466
Raishan-- (roars). As you can see now, this
burbling cloud of greenish black fume just spills

3129
03:37:41,466 --> 03:37:46,414
out of its open jaws, outward towards the crowd.

3130
03:37:46,414 --> 03:37:48,306
LAURA: Jesus!

3131
03:37:48,306 --> 03:37:49,547
MATT: All right.

3132
03:37:49,547 --> 03:37:51,254
SAM: Jesus Crit!

3133
03:37:51,254 --> 03:38:07,772
MATT: I need Grog, Vex, Pike, and Vax, and Percy
to all make a constitution saving throw.

3134
03:38:07,772 --> 03:38:08,849
MARISHA: Am I in there as well?

3135
03:38:08,849 --> 03:38:10,375
SAM: I was in there as well, I think.

3136
03:38:10,375 --> 03:38:16,320
MATT: You were as well, yeah. You guys were as
well. So all-- Yep. Pretty much everyone but--

3137
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:19,030
heh-- everyone but Trinket, probably for the
best.

3138
03:38:19,030 --> 03:38:20,682
TRAVIS: Ten plus eight is 18.

3139
03:38:20,682 --> 03:38:22,163
SAM: This is a constitution saving throw?

3140
03:38:22,163 --> 03:38:23,462
MATT: Correct.

3141
03:38:23,462 --> 03:38:28,335
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words on this? Is this a
magical effect? No, wait.

3142
03:38:28,335 --> 03:38:31,121
MATT: No this isn't a saving throw thing. It just
happens.

3143
03:38:31,121 --> 03:38:33,171
SAM: Oof!

3144
03:38:33,171 --> 03:38:34,268
LAURA: Bad?

3145
03:38:34,268 --> 03:38:37,240
SAM: Oh yeah! (laughs)

3146
03:38:37,240 --> 03:38:39,111
SAM: Five.

3147
03:38:39,111 --> 03:38:40,517
TALIESIN: 14 with resolve.

3148
03:38:40,517 --> 03:38:41,408
MATT: Okay.

3149
03:38:41,408 --> 03:38:42,192
MARISHA: Seven.

3150
03:38:42,192 --> 03:38:42,863
LIAM: 14.

3151
03:38:42,863 --> 03:38:43,470
LAURA: 20.

3152
03:38:43,470 --> 03:38:44,231
TRAVIS: 18.

3153
03:38:44,231 --> 03:38:51,590
MATT: Okay. All of you take 66 points of poison
damage, as you feel your lungs and your outer

3154
03:38:51,590 --> 03:38:54,529
flesh begin to burn and curl.

3155
03:38:54,529 --> 03:38:56,006
LAURA: 20 didn't save?

3156
03:38:56,006 --> 03:39:02,012
MATT: Nope. The rest of the crowd around you
screams out in horrible pain as the rest of them

3157
03:39:02,012 --> 03:39:04,593
gasp and fall to the ground.

3158
03:39:04,593 --> 03:39:07,683
MARISHA: Holy fuck, he just took out the entire
council.

3159
03:39:07,683 --> 03:39:10,505
TRAVIS: If I had resistance to poison damage
because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind, is that halved?

3160
03:39:10,505 --> 03:39:14,050
MATT: You take that halved, yes. You take only
33.

3161
03:39:14,050 --> 03:39:24,575
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me. I'm like, I can't remember--
I can't remember what I'm trying to do. We got to go!

3162
03:39:24,575 --> 03:39:30,519
MATT: Actually, before your turn is over, the
dragon (whoosh) repositions itself for the rest of

3163
03:39:30,519 --> 03:39:34,289
the crowd over there. You get an attack of
opportunity against it, if you want.

3164
03:39:34,289 --> 03:39:43,489
TRAVIS: Oh hey, awesome. That's a 19.

3165
03:39:43,499 --> 03:39:48,689
MATT: 19? That does not hit. You go to strike--
it's already out of the way and you find yourself

3166
03:39:48,696 --> 03:39:52,785
even amongst your rage shaken by this, as you look
around for the first time and realize that the

3167
03:39:52,941 --> 03:39:58,168
crowds of people that were around you are now face
down, unmoving on the ground, amongst the open

3168
03:39:58,168 --> 03:40:03,527
space. As it steps across the wood as it lands,
ruining the last bit of stage and landing on the

3169
03:40:03,527 --> 03:40:05,501
opposite side, Keyleth, it's your turn.

3170
03:40:05,501 --> 03:40:06,989
MARISHA: Are there any trees nearby?

3171
03:40:06,989 --> 03:40:10,337
TRAVIS: Wouldn't mind turning into that mist right
now.

3172
03:40:10,337 --> 03:40:13,237
MARISHA: No shit-- I didn't learn it! Go ahead.

3173
03:40:13,237 --> 03:40:15,769
MATT: There is a tree. There's a tree about 100
feet in that direction.

3174
03:40:15,769 --> 03:40:20,482
MARISHA: 100 feet?!

3175
03:40:20,482 --> 03:40:22,574
LAURA: Or go inside.

3176
03:40:22,574 --> 03:40:26,454
MARISHA: All right, everyone's around me, more or
less?

3177
03:40:26,454 --> 03:40:27,503
MATT: Yeah.

3178
03:40:27,503 --> 03:40:32,794
MARISHA: I slam my staff on the ground and I cast
Anti-Life Shell and I say, (shouts) everyone in

3179
03:40:32,794 --> 03:40:35,346
the shell-- we're running!

3180
03:40:35,346 --> 03:40:38,357
MATT: Okay. How big is the radius of the shell?

3181
03:40:38,357 --> 03:40:46,935
MARISHA: It's not that big. It's ten feet radius,
so you guys are going to have to get close to me.

3182
03:40:46,935 --> 03:40:48,682
MARISHA: Ten feet.

3183
03:40:48,682 --> 03:40:50,081
LIAM: That's enough for all of us.

3184
03:40:50,081 --> 03:40:51,758
MARISHA: That's enough for all of us if we
gather.

3185
03:40:51,758 --> 03:40:53,910
MATT: That's your radius there.

3186
03:40:53,910 --> 03:40:55,372
SAM: I'm right there already!

3187
03:40:55,372 --> 03:40:56,479
MATT: All right.

3188
03:40:56,479 --> 03:40:58,509
MARISHA: Pike and Scanlan are in it, everyone else
needs to get close.

3189
03:40:58,509 --> 03:41:01,638
MATT: Yep, all right, and you're going to stay
there? Wait for everyone to gather to you, or are

3190
03:41:01,638 --> 03:41:04,181
you just going to run and everyone else has to
catch up? Which, if everyone else makes a dash

3191
03:41:04,181 --> 03:41:05,880
movement, they could probably get to you next
round.

3192
03:41:05,880 --> 03:41:06,791
TRAVIS: Yeah, just go.

3193
03:41:06,791 --> 03:41:13,930
MARISHA: All right, yeah, I'll do like 20 feet,
not my full 30 but enough to where people-- no,

3194
03:41:13,930 --> 03:41:15,497
fuck it, I'll do 30 feet.

3195
03:41:15,497 --> 03:41:20,816
MATT: Okay, so you're 30 feet up to the edge
there. All right, that ends your turn. Vax.

3196
03:41:20,816 --> 03:41:26,812
LIAM: I click my boots, and I-- Shit, where is
everybody?

3197
03:41:26,812 --> 03:41:28,778
LAURA: Running towards Keyleth.

3198
03:41:28,778 --> 03:41:34,719
LIAM: I yank Trinket by the fur on his butt and
say, come on Trinket! And then start running

3199
03:41:34,719 --> 03:41:38,823
backwards and grabbing at my sister's cloak as I
go towards Keyleth.

3200
03:41:38,823 --> 03:41:44,217
MATT: Okay, with the boots of haste you get up
within this area pretty easy. Trinket turns and

3201
03:41:44,217 --> 03:41:47,554
sees you run and looks over towards you, which,
it's your next turn.

3202
03:41:47,554 --> 03:41:58,096
LAURA: Okay. I don't know why we're not running
inside, instead of away. Are we running?

3203
03:41:58,096 --> 03:42:02,293
MARISHA: We're running to the tree. So we can
Transport Via Plants, was the thought.

3204
03:42:02,293 --> 03:42:14,039
LAURA: Got it. Okay, I'm going to shout out in
Draconic, and I'm going to say: Raishan! Is that

3205
03:42:14,039 --> 03:42:14,799
his name?

3206
03:42:14,799 --> 03:42:19,670
MATT: Raishan is what it seemed to refer to itself
as.

3207
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:22,064
LAURA: Raishan!

3208
03:42:22,064 --> 03:42:25,153
MARISHA: You got it, you got it!

3209
03:42:25,153 --> 03:42:28,910
LAURA: So sorry for whatever pissed you off so
bad--

3210
03:42:28,910 --> 03:42:32,278
SAM: All right, you had it.

3211
03:42:32,278 --> 03:42:39,153
LAURA: Your fight's with us, not with this city.
Leave the townspeople alone. And I take off

3212
03:42:39,717 --> 03:42:43,167
MATT: Okay. I imagine you tell Trinket to do the
same?

3213
03:42:43,167 --> 03:42:44,196
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, of course.

3214
03:42:44,196 --> 03:42:48,105
MATT: So you rush up. Trinket comes and gathers
off to the side there--

3215
03:42:48,105 --> 03:42:49,340
MARISHA: He's going to kill us, yeah.

3216
03:42:49,340 --> 03:42:52,547
LAURA: Oh! Oh! Can I cast something?

3217
03:42:52,547 --> 03:42:57,568
MATT: We'll say, you are now there, for those who
want to see there, technically, there off to the side.

3218
03:42:57,568 --> 03:43:00,337
LAURA: Can I cast something?

3219
03:43:00,337 --> 03:43:05,029
MATT: To get over there would take both-- it would
take a dash action, so, no. Unless it's a bonus

3220
03:43:05,029 --> 03:43:11,781
action, then you could've, like Hunter's Mark if
you want to do something like that.

3221
03:43:11,781 --> 03:43:16,110
LAURA: I guess I'll do Hunter's Mark on him. I was
going to do Protection From Poison, so I might not

3222
03:43:16,110 --> 03:43:19,225
full dash.

3223
03:43:19,225 --> 03:43:20,620
MATT: Yeah, we'll say-- up to you.

3224
03:43:20,620 --> 03:43:24,359
MARISHA: Is that a radius thing or just for
yourself?

3225
03:43:24,359 --> 03:43:25,716
MATT: What do you want to do? Hunter's Mark?

3226
03:43:25,716 --> 03:43:28,443
LAURA: I'll Hunter's Mark. I'll just dash. I'm
just stupid.

3227
03:43:28,443 --> 03:43:33,176
LIAM: Matt, probably too late, but can I retcon--
say I'm holding my attack, since I didn't do

3228
03:43:33,176 --> 03:43:36,483
anything? Fine if not, I just thought--

3229
03:43:36,483 --> 03:43:40,440
MATT: With the haste you could've gotten there.
I'd say sure. So we'll let you have it. All right,

3230
03:43:40,440 --> 03:43:42,092
holding your attack for what?

3231
03:43:42,092 --> 03:43:43,507
LIAM: If it bears down on us.

3232
03:43:43,507 --> 03:43:46,303
MATT: Okay. Scanlan.

3233
03:43:46,303 --> 03:43:48,717
SAM: Me? I'm going to--

3234
03:43:48,717 --> 03:43:52,911
LAURA: (gasps) What about Gilmore!? Where is he?
He was right next to us.

3235
03:43:52,911 --> 03:43:54,942
MATT: I know.

3236
03:43:54,942 --> 03:43:58,111
TRAVIS: Just keep-- it's not about Gilmore right
now-- it's Scanlan's turn.

3237
03:43:58,111 --> 03:44:00,116
SAM: Where is he?

3238
03:44:00,116 --> 03:44:04,870
MATT: You can make a perception check.

3239
03:44:06,630 --> 03:44:07,760
SAM: 12.

3240
03:44:07,760 --> 03:44:11,294
MATT: 12? You don't see Gilmore anywhere. You look
about the bodies. You know the color of his robe,

3241
03:44:11,294 --> 03:44:16,035
but you don't see it anywhere on the ground. In
the chaos you really have no idea where he is.

3242
03:44:16,167 --> 03:44:23,981
SAM: Okay, I will-- (sings) Bigby's Hand! Shamone!
I will Bigby's Hand and put it right in front of

3243
03:44:23,981 --> 03:44:27,740
him and-- wow, it's so tiny compared to him!

3244
03:44:27,740 --> 03:44:30,353
(laughter)

3245
03:44:30,353 --> 03:44:37,964
SAM: I will use it as a Interposing Hand, blocking
him from approaching us. And I will use my

3246
03:44:37,964 --> 03:44:42,812
movement to climb into the circle of good.

3247
03:44:42,812 --> 03:44:47,349
MATT: Okay, you can get there. Okay, that ends
your turn.

3248
03:44:47,349 --> 03:44:51,265
SAM: And I'll-- shit.

3249
03:44:51,265 --> 03:44:52,539
MATT: Want to inspire somebody?

3250
03:44:52,539 --> 03:44:54,651
SAM: I guess, I mean, who's near him? Just Grog
right?

3251
03:44:54,651 --> 03:45:00,862
MATT: Right now, it's Grog, Percy and Pike are all
still out right now.

3252
03:45:00,862 --> 03:45:04,595
SAM: They'll get away right, they're going to run?
You're going to run, right? They'll be fine. All

3253
03:45:04,595 --> 03:45:12,799
right. I'll inspire Grog by saying, you're a
magnificent, handsome bastard, don't die!

3254
03:45:12,799 --> 03:45:14,671
MATT: All right. You take a d10 inspiration die.

3255
03:45:14,671 --> 03:45:16,303
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3256
03:45:16,303 --> 03:45:28,493
MATT: Pike is going to rush right here and is
going to attempt to cast Mass Cure Wounds. Mass

3257
03:45:28,493 --> 03:45:39,016
Cure Wounds as a 6th-level spell, so that's 4d8
plus five. Six creatures in a 30 foot radius. So

3258
03:45:39,016 --> 03:45:44,133
that'll be-- all of you. She's not going to do it
to herself. Or, she can't do it to Grog, so she

3259
03:45:44,133 --> 03:45:45,014
can get--

3260
03:45:45,014 --> 03:45:46,217
SAM: Grog, did you get hit?

3261
03:45:46,217 --> 03:45:52,542
MATT: She can get everyone but Trinket, but
Trinket seems fine, so-- that is seven, eight, 12,

3262
03:45:52,542 --> 03:45:55,274
15 plus five-- 20 points healed to all of you
guys.

3263
03:45:55,274 --> 03:45:56,249
SAM: Great, that'll help.

3264
03:45:56,249 --> 03:46:02,308
MATT: Except for Grog. That's going to be her
turn, and she just moves into the circle there

3265
03:46:02,308 --> 03:46:05,423
with the rest of her movement. That brings us to
Percy.

3266
03:46:05,423 --> 03:46:10,202
TALIESIN: I'm going to look for Gilmore.

3267
03:46:10,202 --> 03:46:12,025
MATT: Perception check.

3268
03:46:12,025 --> 03:46:14,006
TALIESIN: What!

3269
03:46:14,006 --> 03:46:15,420
LAURA: What happened to you, Percy?

3270
03:46:15,420 --> 03:46:19,487
TALIESIN: I don't know. Nine.

3271
03:46:19,487 --> 03:46:23,405
MATT: In this chaos, you have no idea where he is,
unfortunately.

3272
03:46:23,405 --> 03:46:31,160
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my attack for if the
dragon comes towards us and I'm going to run into the--

3273
03:46:31,160 --> 03:46:35,407
MATT: You rush in. all right, at the end of your
turn, all the rest of these guys just go running.

3274
03:46:35,407 --> 03:46:42,416
Running as far away as possible, getting up, going
at full sprint all over. The guards are trying to

3275
03:46:42,416 --> 03:46:46,999
usher people out of the way. You have crying
mothers who can't find their kid--

3276
03:46:46,999 --> 03:46:47,960
LAURA: Oh god.

3277
03:46:47,960 --> 03:46:52,273
MATT: You have absolute chaos, and at this point
your hear in the distance a large explosion, as

3278
03:46:52,273 --> 03:46:58,417
you see a rolling cloud of fire rise up in the
distance over the mountain and the rest of regular

3279
03:46:58,417 --> 03:47:05,761
Emon, surrounding the Cloudtop District. This guy
over here's going to run as well. Beginning of

3280
03:47:05,761 --> 03:47:07,702
that turn, Grog you're up.

3281
03:47:07,702 --> 03:47:09,481
TRAVIS: I'm booking ass.

3282
03:47:09,481 --> 03:47:12,609
MATT: Okay, with a dash you get over to there.

3283
03:47:12,609 --> 03:47:17,287
SAM: Don't worry, my magical hand is there.
(laughs)

3284
03:47:17,287 --> 03:47:21,096
MATT: Raishan now is going to move over here.

3285
03:47:21,096 --> 03:47:22,475
SAM: Hey, but, I try to stop him!

3286
03:47:22,475 --> 03:47:26,511
MATT: The hand is going to try to--

3287
03:47:26,511 --> 03:47:28,737
SAM: Got a strength of 26.

3288
03:47:28,737 --> 03:47:29,932
MARISHA: That's awesome.

3289
03:47:29,932 --> 03:47:37,782
MATT: Interposing Hand just gives you cover
against the target, and it can't move the hand's

3290
03:47:37,782 --> 03:47:41,914
space if its strength is four, so it's not going
to move through the space, it's going to try and

3291
03:47:41,914 --> 03:47:47,610
move to the side. So instead of going after you
guys, the hand just moves with it and keeps it in

3292
03:47:47,610 --> 03:47:54,790
between, but it stays approximately here. It then
blows towards this crowd here, just catching Grog

3293
03:47:54,790 --> 03:47:58,045
in the corner. So Grog, I need you to make another
constitution save.

3294
03:47:58,045 --> 03:47:59,127
SAM: With inspiration.

3295
03:47:59,127 --> 03:48:01,094
MATT: With inspiration, if you'd like, if you need
it.

3296
03:48:01,094 --> 03:48:06,111
TRAVIS: (mutters) I'm okay. 26.

3297
03:48:06,111 --> 03:48:16,177
MATT: 26. You succeed, so you take we'll say 33
points of poison damage, halved, to 17. All right.

3298
03:48:16,177 --> 03:48:28,137
The rest of these guys except for-- Oh, no, Grog,
no! Grog, no! Those guys all survive, though

3299
03:48:28,137 --> 03:48:35,705
they're coughing and trying to get away. This
brings us to end of his turn. At this point in

3300
03:48:35,705 --> 03:48:45,545
time you look up and see (whoosh whoosh) another
set of wings come slamming down onto this side.

3301
03:48:45,545 --> 03:48:47,743
TRAVIS: Holy shit, look at the size of that thing.
What the hell?

3302
03:48:47,743 --> 03:48:51,453
SAM: (laughing) What is that thing?

3303
03:48:51,453 --> 03:48:57,572
MATT: As it lands, it looks down at the group and
then runs up the side of a building's rooftop up here.

3304
03:48:57,572 --> 03:48:59,202
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ!

3305
03:48:59,209 --> 03:49:03,218
LAURA: So we're totally getting in the tree, I
know it, we're going to make it.

3306
03:49:03,276 --> 03:49:07,717
SAM: (laughs) The tree has been evaporated.

3307
03:49:07,717 --> 03:49:11,204
MATT: So, the rest of you guys, are you all moving
as a group forward?

3308
03:49:11,204 --> 03:49:12,533
SAM: Oh, hells yes!

3309
03:49:12,533 --> 03:49:19,964
MATT: Okay, you all go rushing-- You all go
dashing forward. At full speed, aside from Vax,

3310
03:49:19,964 --> 03:49:22,954
who can get to the tree this turn, the rest of you
are going to get halfway there.

3311
03:49:22,954 --> 03:49:24,204
MARISHA: Fuck!

3312
03:49:24,204 --> 03:49:28,660
MATT: So we'll say for the purposes of this
movement, we'll move it backward.

3313
03:49:28,660 --> 03:49:32,233
MARISHA: There's not a closer bush? Nothing closer
we can jump in?

3314
03:49:32,233 --> 03:49:35,865
MATT: No, not currently. the closest large enough
plant to use this ability--

3315
03:49:35,865 --> 03:49:39,302
SAM: Me and Pike get there, because I Dimension
Door us.

3316
03:49:39,302 --> 03:49:46,705
MATT: Okay. Actually, technically Grog can get
there too, and Vax and Pike and Scanlan. You guys

3317
03:49:46,705 --> 03:49:50,448
all get there. The rest of you are all inside the
Anti-Life Shell as you're running.

3318
03:49:50,448 --> 03:49:54,795
LIAM: I'm not going to leave the group, I'm going
to pace with them.

3319
03:49:54,795 --> 03:49:59,999
MATT: As you're pushing forward, the large black
dragon is just toying with you-- it's climbing

3320
03:49:59,999 --> 03:50:04,550
across the rooftops, and just watching you as you
run, and you hear it chuckling under its breath--

3321
03:50:04,550 --> 03:50:07,911
(menacing chuckle, whoosh, impact).

3322
03:50:07,911 --> 03:50:09,599
TALIESIN: Okay, is he taking to the air?

3323
03:50:09,599 --> 03:50:12,122
MATT: He takes to the air and jumps to another
rooftop.

3324
03:50:12,122 --> 03:50:15,842
TALIESIN: I'm going to try as I'm running-- do I
have enough time to try and take a shot?

3325
03:50:15,842 --> 03:50:16,989
MATT: You can, yeah.

3326
03:50:16,989 --> 03:50:18,703
TALIESIN: Am I going to be able to keep up with he
group?

3327
03:50:18,703 --> 03:50:19,650
MATT: Probably not.

3328
03:50:19,650 --> 03:50:20,663
TALIESIN: Never mind. Damn it, never mind.

3329
03:50:20,663 --> 03:50:24,843
MATT: So you're like, "shit," and you just keep
running. It now jumped over onto this rooftop and

3330
03:50:24,843 --> 03:50:32,519
Raishan has moved up toward the center and making
its way towards you. At this moment, another burst

3331
03:50:32,519 --> 03:50:41,441
of fire over the wall much closer goes (boom) and
swooping out of it, out of the flames, you see the

3332
03:50:41,441 --> 03:50:50,379
largest red dragon you've ever experienced come
swooshing through the flames, rises up past. The

3333
03:50:50,379 --> 03:50:53,519
two other dragons almost lower their heads as it
passes over.

3334
03:50:53,519 --> 03:50:55,533
SAM: Maybe they just want their gold back?

3335
03:50:55,533 --> 03:51:00,049
MATT: (whoosh) It swoops past without even
noticing you all, slams onto the top of the

3336
03:51:00,049 --> 03:51:04,726
palace, causing part of the entire throne room
glass-domed structure to (shattering noise)

3337
03:51:04,726 --> 03:51:09,801
shatter and break inward before it turns around
and plants itself outward. You've seen ancient

3338
03:51:09,801 --> 03:51:17,969
dragons-- this is large for an ancient dragon. In
fact, by its sheer size, you feel like you may

3339
03:51:17,969 --> 03:51:24,536
have have encountered this individual before when
you were passing through the plane of fire.

3340
03:51:24,536 --> 03:51:28,112
LAURA: That fuck that was like the biggest dragon
ever ever?

3341
03:51:28,112 --> 03:51:29,498
SAM: I don't remember that.

3342
03:51:29,498 --> 03:51:33,403
MARISHA: They guy we missed because we laid low
from him and he flew over and we were like:

3343
03:51:33,403 --> 03:51:35,280
'don't move,' and we missed him?

3344
03:51:35,280 --> 03:51:39,057
MATT: As it lands, the two other dragons take a
step back and recoil and snarl and you hear this

3345
03:51:39,057 --> 03:51:47,680
voice come just tearing through the center of the
Cloudtop District, saying, "Move on, Umbrasyl. I

3346
03:51:47,710 --> 03:52:01,729
"claim this as my domain now. The rest of you have
a task to complete. Go! I shall remain and set a

3347
03:52:01,798 --> 03:52:06,432
"new dominion of the Chroma Conclave."

3348
03:52:06,432 --> 03:52:08,513
SAM: (whispering) Chroma Conclave, that's so
cool!

3349
03:52:08,513 --> 03:52:13,493
MATT: At which point the two other dragons snap at
each other and they both-- the black one just

3350
03:52:13,493 --> 03:52:22,553
takes off in this distance. The green dragon
stalks for a second and then (snarls) angrily

3351
03:52:22,553 --> 03:52:28,834
turns around and climbs back onto the top of the
wall and then flies off into the distance as well,

3352
03:52:28,834 --> 03:52:30,923
both of them heading westward.

3353
03:52:30,923 --> 03:52:31,763
LAURA: West.

3354
03:52:31,763 --> 03:52:33,773
SAM: Oh, we're okay! Hey guys, it's fine.

3355
03:52:33,773 --> 03:52:38,633
MATT: You watch as they curve around and start
heading east.

3356
03:52:38,633 --> 03:52:40,523
LAURA: East?

3357
03:52:40,523 --> 03:52:45,473
MATT: At this point, you guys have now reached the
outskirts of the tree and you can see now this

3358
03:52:45,473 --> 03:52:48,315
large red dragon has planted itself--

3359
03:52:48,315 --> 03:52:49,531
LAURA: He died! He died!

3360
03:52:49,531 --> 03:52:55,333
MATT: He's fine, he flew off, it's fine. Just
begins breathing flames into the center of the

3361
03:52:55,333 --> 03:53:02,798
Cloudtop. As you can briefly see javelins being
thrown, bolts being shot, and you hear a wave of

3362
03:53:02,798 --> 03:53:09,866
screams in the distance as it rains death through
the center of Emon. You're at the tree, Keyleth.

3363
03:53:09,866 --> 03:53:12,188
Where are you going? Where are you going?

3364
03:53:12,188 --> 03:53:14,533
MARISHA: Where are we going, what are we doing? Do
we want go back to the keep?

3365
03:53:14,533 --> 03:53:16,951
MARISHA: What do we do?

3366
03:53:16,951 --> 03:53:19,340
LAURA: To the keep. Get underground.

3367
03:53:19,340 --> 03:53:20,986
TRAVIS: We need that skull.

3368
03:53:20,986 --> 03:53:22,442
MARISHA: What?!

3369
03:53:22,442 --> 03:53:25,621
TRAVIS: The skull grants a wish.

3370
03:53:25,621 --> 03:53:27,068
MARISHA: Grog!

3371
03:53:27,068 --> 03:53:29,912
SAM: Just get to the keep-- we can talk about it
there.

3372
03:53:29,912 --> 03:53:32,807
MARISHA: I cast Transport Via Plants on the
fucking tree!

3373
03:53:32,807 --> 03:53:37,519
MATT: The tree-- opens up and a small oval,
almond-shaped portal and you can see, it's in the

3374
03:53:37,519 --> 03:53:42,354
intensity, it's partially unstable but it's
keeping itself clean. You guys each dive in as the

3375
03:53:42,354 --> 03:53:43,943
Anti-Life shell vanishes.

3376
03:53:43,943 --> 03:53:46,682
LAURA: I shout: Gilmore! Before I go though.

3377
03:53:46,682 --> 03:53:51,989
MATT: Okay, and you come leaping through the
center of the tree as it closed behind you.

3378
03:53:51,989 --> 03:53:56,313
And we're going to end tonight's session on that
point!

3379
03:53:56,313 --> 03:54:02,140
LIAM: Thought we were going to be starting a
brand-new Shadowrun campaign next week!

3380
03:54:02,140 --> 03:54:10,830
SAM: You know, maybe the warden of that jail was a
dragon! And he invited his friends to find us.

3381
03:54:10,830 --> 03:54:15,366
LAURA: Did this all happen because we went back to
General Krieg's place? Did we kill the entire city

3382
03:54:15,366 --> 03:54:17,523
because we went back to General Krieg's place?

3383
03:54:17,523 --> 03:54:22,065
SAM: But think of the 4,000 gold we got! (laughs)

3384
03:54:22,065 --> 03:54:26,310
LAURA: Or maybe this was a long time coming and it
just happened to time up.

3385
03:54:26,310 --> 03:54:28,189
SAM: We'll find out.

3386
03:54:28,189 --> 03:54:32,644
MARISHA: I'm hoping it's the first, I'm hoping
it's the first.

3387
03:54:32,644 --> 03:54:37,222
MATT: We shall see if all of these interests come
to reveal themselves in the future--

3388
03:54:37,222 --> 03:54:38,883
LIAM: That was frightening, man.

3389
03:54:38,883 --> 03:54:40,175
MATT: -- for future episodes of Critical Role.

3390
03:54:40,175 --> 03:54:42,137
MARISHA: What did we do?

3391
03:54:42,137 --> 03:54:47,289
TRAVIS: You just massacred people. You just
committed genocide.

3392
03:54:47,289 --> 03:54:54,121
MATT: I just destroyed something that I built.
It's a really weird feeling.

3393
03:54:54,121 --> 03:54:57,413
LAURA: You destroyed your whole city, Matt.

3394
03:54:57,413 --> 03:54:59,352
MARISHA: The whole city, everyone's dead.

3395
03:54:59,352 --> 03:55:00,637
TRAVIS: Well done!

3396
03:55:00,637 --> 03:55:05,506
SAM: Not everyone, just a couple of dozen people.
And Gilmore.

3397
03:55:05,506 --> 03:55:09,348
LAURA: This is Act Two of the game, of the video
game that you're playing.

3398
03:55:09,348 --> 03:55:10,753
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

3399
03:55:10,753 --> 03:55:15,303
MATT: So with that, folks, as it closes on 11
o'clock, we have to get ourselves a rest for the

3400
03:55:15,303 --> 03:55:20,469
evening. We hope you've enjoyed tonight's game. I
forgot to announce earlier because I was feeling

3401
03:55:20,469 --> 03:55:27,429
all tense and-- yeah-- but we have a winner of our
initial drawing.

3402
03:55:27,429 --> 03:55:29,253
TALIESIN: It was a thing, wasn't it?

3403
03:55:29,253 --> 03:55:34,295
MATT: Earl Grey Austin was the winner tonight of
our Critical Role package.

3404
03:55:34,295 --> 03:55:37,088
So congratulations to you, buddy

3405
03:55:37,088 --> 03:55:38,337
TALIESIN: Someone won tonight! That's so nice.

3406
03:55:38,337 --> 03:55:42,099
LAURA: Someone won.

3407
03:55:45,499 --> 03:55:48,534
MATT: All right, well guys, have a wonderful
night, thank you all for watching, we'll see you

3408
03:55:48,534 --> 03:55:50,765
next Thursday.

3409
03:55:50,765 --> 03:55:51,821
MARISHA: I'm going to have an aneurysm.
