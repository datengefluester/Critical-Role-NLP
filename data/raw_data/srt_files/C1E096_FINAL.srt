1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,561
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:10,546
around and play Dungeons and Dragons. We have an
Ashley Johnson in transit from the airport, fresh

3
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:14,436
from her vacation. She'll be here asap.

4
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,827
MARISHA: I wonder if she'll be nice and tanned.

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,043
TRAVIS: (burps) Probably not.

6
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,746
SAM: That's too specific. Too specific, she might
have gone to a place

7
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,301
that wasn't a tannable place.

8
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:24,466
MARISHA: Oh, that's true. That's true.

9
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,570
SAM: Too specific.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,267
TALIESIN: Could have been tundra. Could have been
tundra.

11
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:31,402
MATT: This is true. Should be the tundra. Sounds
like a great place to spend--

12
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,490
LIAM: She could have gone skiing and just gotten a
sunburn here, like this.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,903
MATT: That's true. That's true. Anyway, so Ashley
will be joining us as soon as she arrives. Coming

14
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:44,380
in hot! In the meantime, let's go ahead and cruise
through our announcements. Let's see. Do we have

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,399
any updates on merch at all, Laura?

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,266
LAURA: Yeah!

17
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,242
MATT: What do you got?

18
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:52,668
LAURA: Okay. So we put our dice up for pre-order
and they're already sold out in pre-order.

19
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:53,809
MATT: What?

20
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,313
LAURA: But we're going to get more. I don't know
when, but soon, very soon.

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,863
TRAVIS: We're struggling to keep up.

22
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:03,907
LAURA: Yeah. We have these still in stock though.
Some of these are still left, which are awesome,

23
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:07,890
and they're so soft. And we have all the other
t-shirts as well, except for the 'dagger, dagger,

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,971
dagger' that Matt's wearing. Maybe we'll be
getting those back in. I'm not sure. But all the

25
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:18,173
other stuff. The nail wraps, and the vinyl
stickers, and the hats.

26
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:24,967
MATT: I still remember when we printed ourselves a
hundred shirts on this show, hoping that maybe

27
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,418
some people will buy some.

28
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:29,978
LAURA: I mean, do you remember the party that we
had when we all put them in the envel--

29
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,002
sorry, baby.

30
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:34,274
(laughter)

31
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:38,715
LIAM: How many dice are you able to build a
night?

32
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:45,361
LAURA: Oh. I hand-carve like ten to 20 depending
how much time I have but--

33
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,515
TRAVIS: (whip crack)

34
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,234
LIAM: I mean, that's what the wait is for.

35
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,464
TALIESIN: Mine's kind of wonky, can I get a new
one? Got a little--

36
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:55,289
LAURA: I'm sorry if they're misbalanced. I make
them out of soap, so--

37
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,365
TRAVIS: Stone. Soap-stone.

38
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:00,369
MARISHA: Do you use Charlie to clean up the
shavings?

39
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,229
TRAVIS: He's a good little worker.

40
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,653
MATT: It's pretty cool, too, because if you want
to balance or find out and make sure the dice are

41
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:07,665
perfectly balanced, you put it in the water but
then you can't use the dice anymore because it

42
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:08,832
just makes it soap.

43
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,165
LAURA: Yeah. But you smell fresh and clean.

44
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:17,409
MATT: This is true. So fresh and so clean. All
righty. Taliesin, Wednesday Club coming up.

45
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:23,218
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're talking about the Eisners
this week. The Eisners got announced all in-- a

46
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:24,427
couple friends of the show.

47
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:25,559
MARISHA: Yeah, Jodie.

48
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:29,469
TALIESIN: Jodie got announced. I think Max got
announced for one. I haven't gone through the

49
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,065
whole list, but we're going to start talking about
the Eisners and it's probably-- we're going to

50
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:37,203
break it up but I think we're probably going to
have three talks about the Eisners. There's a lot

51
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,547
to talk about. It'll be great.

52
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,041
MARISHA: Yeah, like what are the Eisners?

53
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,872
TALIESIN: What are the Eisners? Who was Eisner?
And--

54
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:43,220
MARISHA: And why Eisner?

55
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,614
TALIESIN: What are these books? What does it mean?
We don't know. We'll find out.

56
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:47,757
MARISHA: And why do we care?

57
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:50,133
TALIESIN: I don't know. But we do.

58
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,880
MATT: 'Cause they're awesome. So that's Wednesday
Club on Wednesday at noon to 2PM.

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,748
TALIESIN: Wednesday, noon to 2PM Pacific Standard
Time.

60
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,679
MATT: Perfecto. New episode of Signal Boost went
up this week.

61
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,058
Marisha, you want to talk about that?

62
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:05,101
MARISHA: It was Hannah Mahoney. It was good. You
should watch it.

63
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,562
MATT: (singsong) Hannah Mahoney.

64
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,889
MARISHA: She's got a cool name.

65
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,844
MATT: That's one of the coolest names.

66
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:14,506
MARISHA: Yeah, Hannah Mahoney? That's a dope name.
But yeah. Go check it out.

67
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,725
MATT: Pretty sure a Street Fighter character says
that when they make an attack.

68
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,277
MARISHA: Yeah, most definitely.

69
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:21,828
MATT: Like, I want that name so bad. It's
amazing.

70
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,151
MARISHA: And we're filming again soon.

71
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,056
MATT: There you go.

72
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:29,424
MARISHA: We're filming soon. Maybe someday Sam
will come on. Maybe someday Bailey will come on.

73
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:34,866
Maybe someday Ashley will come on. It's a
mystery.

74
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,272
TRAVIS: She didn't say my fucking name.

75
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,746
(laughter)

76
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:40,541
MARISHA: I just assumed you're not interested,
'cause you've never been.

77
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,116
TRAVIS: This is a sportsball.

78
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:46,853
MATT: Actually, can you please do that? It's ten
seconds long, and that's the entire episode.

79
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:52,244
MARISHA: I still wanna make Sportsball, but you
won't let me. I wanna make it with you. See? He

80
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:53,064
says no.

81
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,888
LAURA: Don't say you wanna make it with my
husband.

82
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,484
(laughter)

83
00:03:56,484 --> 00:04:03,628
SAM: Why don't we all make Sportsball without
Travis, and just be terrible at talking about

84
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:07,644
sports, and he'll be like, I can't, I can't watch
this, I gotta go do it.

85
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:11,068
TALIESIN: Which ones are the Gryffindors? I know
one of these two teams is the Gryffindors.

86
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:15,142
TRAVIS: I would watch every episode of that. I
would correct nothing.

87
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:18,843
TALIESIN: Oh wait, wait, that's the line de
scrimmage, right? That's where they--

88
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,928
TRAVIS: The lined of scrimmage.

89
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,855
TALIESIN: The line of scrimmage, yeah. The line.

90
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:28,078
MARISHA: How about this? Will you come on Signal
Boost, and we can do a pseudo-pilot test of

91
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,471
Sportsball with Signal Boost? Would you do that?

92
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,701
TRAVIS: Nope, fuck that.

93
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:33,953
MARISHA: See? And he wonders why I didn't ask.

94
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,750
MATT: All righty. So, next up.

95
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,690
(laughter)

96
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:47,361
MATT: Once again, MomoCon's coming up very, very
close, May 25th to the 28th. Taliesin, Marisha,

97
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:56,393
myself, and Brian Foster will be there to talk
about nerdy stuff. MomoCon? Two Street Fighter

98
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:59,739
attacks in one intro. This is already a good
Thursday, I'm excited.

99
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:02,355
LIAM: How-do-you-want-to-DOUKEN!

100
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:11,189
MATT: And I would-- please, I would beg you,
nobody put that laser in my eye. Please. I've

101
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:22,433
already got lasers in them once. Children.
Children! Thanks, whoever sent those. It's great.

102
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:23,736
I love it.

103
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,767
(laughter)

104
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:35,096
MATT: Why must you arm them? It's herding cats
enough as it is. All right, and then Talks Machina

105
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:39,688
is live on Tuesdays at 7PM, of course, we're gonna
be next Tuesday with Brian Foster, talking about

106
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,908
this episode, so come check it out on Twitch and
Alpha.

107
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,413
And do we have anything else anyone wants to--

108
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:52,105
SAM: I have an announcement. We have a fan out
there who just got out of surgery. His name is

109
00:05:52,105 --> 00:06:01,238
Kurt Shappacher, but in D&amp;D is known as Bork, The
Most Eloquent Half-Orc, and I want to wish him a

110
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,360
speedy recovery.

111
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,737
MATT: Speedy recovery!

112
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:07,084
SAM: And I'll kiss his surgical scar if I ever
meet him.

113
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,786
MARISHA: Wow.

114
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,862
SAM: Depending on where it is on his body. I
mean.

115
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:20,843
MATT: Aw, that won't stop you, Sam. This is true.
Awesome. And then we have this fantastic

116
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,029
scenario.

117
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,477
LIAM: You were not able to attend Critmas.

118
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:25,537
SAM: I was not.

119
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:29,048
LIAM: But you were sent something very specific by
a huge list of Critters.

120
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,299
LAURA: Which just fell on the ground.

121
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,530
LIAM: I will get that in a second. We haven't
looked at it.

122
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,832
SAM: Am I to unveil it right now?

123
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:38,705
LIAM: Right now. There could be something so foul
on it, we don't know.

124
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:47,954
SAM: Can you help me unveil it, people at table
one? It is a quilt. Oh my god. It's so big. It's

125
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:54,089
so mighty. It's so many pictures of me! This is
everything that I've ever wanted to sleep on.

126
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,848
LAURA: Why is it velcro?

127
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,258
SAM: Why are you ripping this thing?

128
00:06:58,258 --> 00:06:59,393
TALIESIN: There's velcro!

129
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,527
SAM: Don't tear it!

130
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:02,844
(laughter)

131
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:05,668
MATT: Yeah, it's a velcro duvet cover.

132
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:11,877
SAM: It's all posts and artwork of my character--
my former character, Scanlan Shorthalt!

133
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,945
(laughter)

134
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,353
SAM: Wow, it's so great.

135
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:16,408
MATT: That's amazing.

136
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,656
SAM: Wow.

137
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:22,154
LAURA: I need you to stand up with it so we can
see what it looks like.

138
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,855
MATT: I love the giant mustache, there's a giant
mustache on there.

139
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,272
TALIESIN: I think it divides into four, actually.

140
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:26,515
MATT: Does it really?

141
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:32,639
MARISHA: Wait, is it a cube? It is not a cube. Is
it?

142
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,084
SAM: We'll find out at the break, we'll find out
at the break.

143
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,903
We're not gonna waste too much time, here.

144
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,401
TALIESIN: Yup, that's a thing, okay.

145
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:44,081
MATT: There you go, yeah, there is a mustache,
that's awesome.

146
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:48,890
SAM: It's so great. Picture of me, picture of me,
another picture of me. I love it.

147
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,952
(laughter)

148
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,200
LAURA: There was one more thing.

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,223
LIAM: This is a quick one.

150
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,173
SAM: There's another thing?

151
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,937
LAURA: Yeah. You got a bunch of things, but these
are the ones we're passing to you on the show.

152
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,104
LIAM: It's an itty-bitty Doty.

153
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:07,624
SAM: Oh, it is a little itty-bitty Doty! And he's
got a tiny little book! Oh, he's so cute. The

154
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:11,465
little book actually has little pages. It's so
cute.

155
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:13,108
LIAM: I sold Travis's gifts.

156
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,802
LAURA: Made a lot of money off of them.

157
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:16,960
LIAM: Five dollars.

158
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,652
SAM: It was a real Heisman trophy.

159
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,679
(laughter)

160
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:26,795
TRAVIS: Damn, that would be awesome. If you have a
real Heisman trophy, please, send it to our PO

161
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,631
box. I will take that.

162
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:31,392
MATT: Unearned accolades.

163
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:34,802
SAM: If you get a Heisman trophy, will you do
Sportsball: The Show?

164
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:38,292
LAURA: Yes, yes, you have to say yes to that.

165
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,887
LIAM: Teach me how to sports.

166
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,969
TRAVIS: For one episode. If I get a legitimate
Heisman trophy.

167
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,483
SAM: What about a Superbowl ring?

168
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:49,341
TRAVIS: Yes, I'll do a whole thing of Sportsball.
If you give me a Superbowl ring that's worth 45

169
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,113
grand? Yeah.

170
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,194
(laughter)

171
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:57,393
SAM: You heard him, Critters! Go on out and-- for
a shitty show?

172
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:05,281
TRAVIS: Diamond-encrusted, super well-paid, yeah,
I'll do that. We'll have lasers and smoke and all

173
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,291
sorts of shit.

174
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:12,963
MARISHA: Nope, can't get that from LDN.
Cannot promise that from Legendary. Nope. Not for

175
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:17,732
a Twitch show. If you make it an Alpha show, then
I can get you money.

176
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,179
(laughter)

177
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:23,431
TALIESIN: The Alpha team is laughing right now.

178
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:29,910
MARISHA: They know it's true. Just like we all
know our logo looks like a weed shop sign. We all

179
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:37,481
know it's true. I should probably stop saying this
stuff. It might be a breach of contract. Let's

180
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:38,535
keep going.

181
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,304
(laughter)

182
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:42,034
SAM: We'll edit this out later.

183
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,367
MATT: We'll fix it in post.

184
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,954
LIAM: Just like rehearsal.

185
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:52,633
MATT: All right, so, let's get ready to dive in. I
know today's been a harrowing day for a lot of

186
00:09:52,633 --> 00:10:00,676
people. It's gonna be okay. And don't forget what
this feels like. That's all I have to say.

187
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:01,984
LAURA: And we love you.

188
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:09,638
MATT: We love you so much. It's gonna be all
right. Don't forget. On that note, everyone, let's

189
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:14,011
go ahead and bring ourselves in to dive into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

190
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,535
LIAM: Whee!

191
00:10:15,535 --> 00:11:45,391
[dramatic music]

192
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,193
TRAVIS: -- Tetris.

193
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:48,627
MATT: Welcome back.

194
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,518
(laughter)

195
00:11:51,518 --> 00:12:04,378
MATT: God damn it. Anyway. I expect everything
else. Well done. Well done, Travis, well done.

196
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:11,755
It's like worrying walking through a door 'cause
everyone's just waiting to punch you as you come

197
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:14,089
through. Every week. It's kind of amazing.

198
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,560
LIAM: It's one of those videos where the guys are
waiting with the big exercise balls to just wing

199
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,426
them there.

200
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:22,151
MATT: Yeah, no shit, and you know what? I'm
stronger for it. So thank you guys. You've been

201
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,965
training me with weights on for two years now.

202
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:26,585
LIAM: You have passed through fire.

203
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:38,492
MATT: So, last we left off, Vox Machina, having
completed their venture over the past few arcs,

204
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:44,672
having freed Whitestone from the tyranny of the
Briarwoods, having brought down the Chroma

205
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:54,042
Conclave, and essentially brought freedom back to
Tal'Dorei, you closed up some loose ends, Keyleth

206
00:12:54,042 --> 00:13:01,173
finished her Aramente, and you all went to your
business for a year-long time jump. You returned,

207
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:06,182
and each of you recounted the things you wished to
accomplish in that year, culminating in a Winter's

208
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:17,559
Crest beachside vacation in the Bay of Gifts at
the Port of Shamel, which involved some escalating

209
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,770
pranks.

210
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,645
LAURA: Wait a minute, is it really the Bay of
Gifts? With a "T"?

211
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:23,859
MATT: Yes, with a "T".

212
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:26,890
LAURA: I seriously thought it's the Bay of Gifs.
This whole time.

213
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,288
TALIESIN: The Bay of Jifs.

214
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,686
LAURA: I'm sorry, okay, I understand now.

215
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,775
LIAM: Retcon.

216
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:39,633
MATT: And it is so named because it is such a
centralized port for trade across the various

217
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:45,981
continents in that area, so it's a place where
it's affluent, and it's funny, it's kind of

218
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:51,549
ironic, 'cause everything there is expensive, as
you found out. But, nevertheless, you returned to

219
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:57,105
your home in Whitestone, and reconvened,
especially after building your bake shop in

220
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:00,574
Whitestone, but she's not paying attention, so
that's fine.

221
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,675
LAURA: I'm sorry, he was distracting me.

222
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,252
MATT: That's okay. Anyway, so.

223
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,311
TRAVIS: Fucking twins.

224
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:15,269
MATT: (laughs) I know, seriously. But upon
situating yourselves after you've returned, and

225
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:24,526
enjoying this peaceful period of recovery and
expansion of Whitestone itself, there was an

226
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:31,460
arrival on the outskirts of the city. There was a
cart, horses pulling a group of four gnomes that

227
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:40,248
all eventually revealed themselves to be family of
Pike Trickfoot. After taking them in, whether or

228
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:45,793
not you were excited or eager to, nevertheless,
you treated them with hospitality, you gave them a

229
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:49,934
place to stay, you gave them food for the evening,
conversations were had, information was passed

230
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:56,488
around, and a handful of you, upon listening in on
some of the conversations and pushing for

231
00:14:56,488 --> 00:15:04,451
information with the eldest of them, Uncle Ogden,
discovered some sort of true purpose as to why

232
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:09,709
they came to Whitestone, dealing with, apparently,
a long-running blood curse that lies in the

233
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,859
Trickfoot family. And Ogden, having visions, had,
along with the rest of the family that takes care

234
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:23,561
of him, made their way towards Whitestone as the
information gathered by JB Trickfoot, the esteemed

235
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:31,296
keeper of knowledge about your journey over the
past year or so, and the exploits of her cousin,

236
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:38,758
Pike, has told you. So, that being the case,
you've promised them a tour of the grounds, and,

237
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:44,751
perhaps, seeking more information about what the
next steps are in regarding this curse, if there

238
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:50,560
are any. So, with that, you all finish your
evening. Eating of your meals, drinking deep of

239
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,704
your cups, and eventually finding yourselves
resting 'til the night took you and sleep was had.

240
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,533
The morning comes, you wake up rested, and the day
is yours. What do you wish to do?

241
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:08,494
LAURA: I think we had talked about going to see
Pike's great-grandfather, Wilhand, to talk about

242
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,733
the curse with him, right?

243
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:14,210
TRAVIS: Don't look at me, I have a tour to give.

244
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,487
LAURA: Right, Grog and Percival, you were going to
help with that tour.

245
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,589
TALIESIN: Yes.

246
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:20,418
LAURA: To keep him out of trouble.

247
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:21,168
TRAVIS: What?

248
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,511
LAURA: Huh?

249
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:27,348
MARISHA: Maybe keep an eye on them, make sure they
don't have sticky fingers.

250
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,982
TRAVIS: They don't wash their hands?

251
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:32,160
LAURA: Not very often. You saw how much candy they
were eating yesterday.

252
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,973
TRAVIS: That's really disgusting.

253
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:38,549
LIAM: Do you want to do the talking and I'll keep
an eye on hands?

254
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:42,710
TALIESIN: I think, between the three of us, it
should be fine if

255
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,649
the rest of you want to go and--

256
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:45,868
MARISHA: Talk to Wilhand?

257
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:49,141
TALIESIN: -- talk to Wilhand and see what
information you can glean.

258
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,119
MARISHA: Percy?

259
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:50,984
TALIESIN: Yes.

260
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:52,102
MARISHA: I have a question.

261
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,323
TALIESIN: All right.

262
00:16:53,323 --> 00:17:01,029
MARISHA: Ogden, in his ramblings, mentioned a
shadowy figure with burning coal eyes. This

263
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,430
doesn't sound like anything that you're familiar
with, does it?

264
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:15,611
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, yes, but that is honestly
like saying 'a man with brown hair of average

265
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:20,716
height' when it comes to these sorts of creatures.
It could be anything. It's kind of the effect they

266
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:21,915
go for.

267
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,662
MARISHA: How did Orthax take his form with you?

268
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:26,906
TALIESIN: No glowing eyes.

269
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,880
MARISHA: No glowing eyes.

270
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,015
TALIESIN: No. So, there's that.

271
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,276
LAURA: He had a bird-like thing in the face.

272
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,574
TALIESIN: A bit of smoke. Lots of smoke and
bird-like.

273
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:37,081
LIAM: It's quite an aesthetic.

274
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:42,668
MARISHA: But you think it might still be of the
same fiendish nature?

275
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:48,338
TALIESIN: Honestly, who knows? We don't know
enough yet. It's too general.

276
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,537
LIAM: It could also potentially be bullshit.

277
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:59,619
TALIESIN: It could also potentially be bullshit.
We'll know more when they decide to open up, or if

278
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,923
your travels for information bear fruit.

279
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:06,059
MARISHA: Should we bring Wilhand back here?

280
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,377
TALIESIN: I imagine that depends on him.

281
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:09,989
LAURA: If he wants to come.

282
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,299
SAM: We're taking Pike to Wilhand, I mean.

283
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,500
LAURA: Yes.

284
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,085
SAM: Pike, you want to go see Wilhand, right?

285
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,250
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) Oh, yes!

286
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,132
SAM: Oh! I'll take that as a yes.

287
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:28,103
MATT: Get here soon, Ashley! Please! Have you guys
informed Pike of this information?

288
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,663
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, we talked about it last
time.

289
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:37,454
MATT: At the end of the last-- yeah, so she's
like, "I mean, I think we should. Right?"

290
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:40,481
MARISHA: Well, how about you guys go on your
tour--

291
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:45,857
LAURA: First. I mean, we'll head over there while
you guys do--

292
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:49,524
SAM: Simultaneously, but we'll leave just a moment
later.

293
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:50,587
MARISHA: Yeah, theoretically.

294
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,877
TALIESIN: So while this is both happening at the
same time, there'll be some sort of narrative

295
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:54,822
distance.

296
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,306
MARISHA: Yeah, just a little.

297
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:58,348
LIAM: What are you saying?

298
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:01,426
TALIESIN: I don't know, I just had this weird
aneurysm just hit my brain, I'm not entirely sure

299
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,435
what it was.

300
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:06,341
MARISHA: Just so when historians look back, and
they want a detailed timeline of our lives.

301
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:07,668
LIAM: Life is not a book!

302
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:10,709
LAURA: Well, it depends on who you ask.

303
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:13,733
TALIESIN: Have you met my friend, Lord Fourth
Wall?

304
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:17,593
LAURA: She wants to go see Wilhand, Pike
definitely wants to go see Wilhand.

305
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:24,281
MARISHA: We'll see you in 24 hours.

306
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:27,499
LAURA: We'll head towards the old Sun Tree!

307
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:34,810
MAT: As you guys head down, you pass by the dining
hall for breakfast. And there you already see

308
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,938
Astra and Johann are in the process of having
their own breakfast. By that, I mean you see

309
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:46,483
Astra, who's currently hand-stitching new clothing
from a clump of high-quality silks that she seems

310
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:52,299
to have pulled from a number of noble dresses that
are left within their guest quarters of

311
00:19:52,299 --> 00:20:02,517
Whitestone. As you glance on the table, there's a
number of them folded over, but sections have been

312
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:06,091
cut out, there's a pair of scissors on the side,
and she's currently stitching through. As you walk

313
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:07,776
in, she glances up and goes,

314
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:13,042
"I've needed some new dresses for far too long. 
Y'all have some fine cloth here!"

315
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:16,022
LAURA: Were those-- those didn't belong to your--

316
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:24,269
TALIESIN: Oh. There's more. A few more at least.
So. Yes.

317
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:31,268
MATT: And you watch as she fans out this new
blouse. It's not the finest craftsmanship, but

318
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:35,205
functional enough. She goes (sighs), rubs it
against her face. "That's nice."

319
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:37,808
And squeezes into it.

320
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:45,720
LAURA: I go and grab a servant and tell them to
quickly remove all of the clothing from the

321
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,231
wardrobes in the guest quarters so that they don't
do it again.

322
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:52,608
TALIESIN: Anything that hasn't been cut yet, yes,
please.

323
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:59,464
MATT: "Right away, Lady." Rushes off quickly. As
this is happening, Johann's in the process of

324
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:09,909
eating a breakfast that primarily consists of just
fine cakes. He has clusters of dried baked good

325
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:14,491
around the outside of his mouth and caught in his
mustache, he's freshly washed his hair, freshly

326
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:20,022
combed over and slicked with whatever equivalent
of pomade he carries with himself. And as you walk

327
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:26,662
by, you see this-- like he has the plate and
there's just a crumb-circle around it that has

328
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:32,296
emerged, and is in the process of his gluttonous
eating, he stops and goes, "Such delicacies are a

329
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:38,150
"rare treat! You have to make time to enjoy the
little things in life, don't you? At least when

330
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,836
"the opportunity arises."

331
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:48,022
TALIESIN: Ah. A fairy circle. Make a wish. Ah.
Anyway. We were hoping to gather the clan and take

332
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:51,807
you on a tour of the estate when you're prepared.

333
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:57,090
MATT: Pulls up his shirt and dabs at his mouth. It
barely touches any of the actual food that's

334
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,229
around his mouth area. He stops and goes, "Right,
right, of course, of course. We'll just wait for

335
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:11,290
"old Ogden to find his way down. He's a bit of a
stickler when it comes to his time. So be patient,

336
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,185
"sit down, let's have a meal! Why not get to know
each other a little better, yes?"

337
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:21,208
TRAVIS: We do gotta wait for Uncle OG. By the way,
since I'm the tour guide, do you have any plume-y

338
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,203
hats? You know? 'Cause if you take like a campus
tour, they have a flag and they're like,

339
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:33,046
"Over here!" In case you get lost. Or like when tourists
walk around and they're like, "Don't get left-- mm."

340
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,973
Do you have anything like that?

341
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:39,863
TALIESIN: Let me check. I'll be right back.

342
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:40,904
TRAVIS: Good.

343
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:42,485
LAURA: I'll go with him.

344
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:44,409
SAM: What campus tours have you been on?

345
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,012
(laughter)

346
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:48,386
LIAM: Is Trinket here?

347
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:49,587
LAURA: Yes.

348
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:53,622
LIAM: Trinket, breakfast, right around the little
guy there. Go on. Free food.

349
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:59,882
MATT: At which point, as you're having this
conversation, the large bear starts lumbering up,

350
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:07,599
armor clattering as it approaches the table with
absolutely no care or interest in the gnomish guy

351
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,610
at the table, who immediately goes, "Oh!
My-my-my-my!" And he backs out the center of his

352
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:19,034
seat as the bear immediately (impact sounds) paws
up and (slurps) starts licking up the crumbs and

353
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:25,439
pieces of wayward pastry that have not found their
way to the gnome's mouth, at which point he stands

354
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:36,398
up off of his chair and rights himself. "Hm. Well.
I'm stuffed. Let's go see how Ogden's doing. Astra!"

355
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,465
"I'll be-- let me just finish this."

356
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:43,833
"All right, we'll pick you up in a second. I'll go
check in on Ogden."

357
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:50,086
And he gets up and walks past,
up the stairs. You are searching for what?

358
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:54,539
TALIESIN: Oh, well, I've gone into my sister's
bedroom and have begun to raid the spring clothing

359
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:59,540
to find the most ostentatious hat I can find and
start shoving as many

360
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,201
things into it as I possibly can.

361
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,417
MATT: Make an investigation check, please.

362
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,691
LAURA: I was going with you. I had said I went
with you. Mostly to get away from the gnomes.

363
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:07,900
MATT: So you're both searching?

364
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,927
TALIESIN: Yes.

365
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:13,614
MATT: So make an investigation check with
advantage.

366
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:17,438
TALIESIN: 15.

367
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:24,526
MATT: Okay. Takes you a little bit, and you're
being careful not to be too loud, 'cause the last

368
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,015
thing you want is Cassandra to come in and watch
you tearing through her outfits. But you do find

369
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:37,815
what essentially amounts to a wide-brimmed
captain's hat. It comes almost to a tri-corner

370
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:45,414
point at the front and curves upward. It's mostly
used for costuming purposes, it's reminiscent of

371
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:50,439
masquerade balls, it's used for-- you actually
recall, when she was younger, it was part of her

372
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:53,829
masquerade ball wear. There was a mask with a long
nose.

373
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,073
TALIESIN: Sure, and it'll be very ill-fitting
now.

374
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:57,839
LAURA: Ooh, are there any ribbons around?

375
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,528
MATT: Yeah, you find ribbons easily enough.

376
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:04,371
LAURA: I wanna tie a big purple giant bow around
the top of it.

377
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:08,164
TALIESIN: Get a feather in there, get the whole
thing really. So it's very hard to lose him.

378
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:09,752
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

379
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:24,157
LAURA: To see if I can tie a bow? Okay. Oh, that's
a saving throw. This is low, but that's a 12.

380
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,621
MATT: Okay.

381
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:27,033
LAURA: It's a bow.

382
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:35,141
MATT: Oh no. You successfully-- (laughs) You
successfully create what is a bombastic bow of

383
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:42,793
varying layers that plumes out three times. It
resembles ribbon candy, almost, in the way that it

384
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:50,134
billows out multiple ways, but it is pinned to the
top, so it poofs as it cascades down the sides of

385
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,308
the hat.

386
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:53,440
TALIESIN: Are we missing something? I don't know.
Is it finished?

387
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,384
LAURA: A big feather, like a white, plumey
feather?

388
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:59,999
TALIESIN: I think we probably have a white, plumey
feather. Oh, wait--

389
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,221
LAURA: Or any color, really.

390
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:06,235
TALIESIN: I'm gonna look to see if I can find some
bells.

391
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:15,130
MATT: Okay. Not in Cassandra's room, but there is
the royal stable not far away, which does have

392
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:22,093
bells available in case they want to have parade
accoutrements for the various horses and other

393
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:23,172
afforded creatures.

394
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:25,082
LAURA: Are these like jingle bells or big cow
bells?

395
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,458
MATT: No, they're like jingle bells.

396
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:32,576
TALIESIN: All right. I'm actually going to send
you on that one, since you have the broom. We'll

397
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,277
need two. I'll find a feather. All right. I'm
going to just take a quill, basically, and stick

398
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,718
it in there. I don't even care.

399
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,458
MARISHA: You're making a Derby hat. That's
appropriate.

400
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,950
TALIESIN: I know, it's wonderful.

401
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,428
MATT: So yeah, over the next ten minutes or so,
between your journey and your finding the proper

402
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:55,245
feather plume, you guys manage to cobble together
a delightfully ostentatious hat for Grog's

403
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:57,844
presentory tour of Whitestone.

404
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:01,048
LAURA: I want the bells to hang from either side
like around his ears. Right here.

405
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:04,319
MATT: Okay, okay, cool. There you go. He has a
couple of dangly bells.

406
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,567
TALIESIN: I needed this.

407
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:09,606
TRAVIS: It'll be good, it'll be like Karate Kid
with the toy when he starts spinning it.

408
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:13,934
MATT: Perfect.

409
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,704
TRAVIS: Oh, bells in my face.

410
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,708
(laughter)

411
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:29,482
MATT: This magnificent mess of a hat that you guys
have created is on par, if not slightly beyond,

412
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:33,260
the previous helmet that he had acquired while in
Syngorn.

413
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,438
TALIESIN: Yeah, the horn helmet was pretty
spectacular,

414
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,337
but I feel like we may have topped it.

415
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:42,287
MATT: So. With that completed, what do you wish to
do?

416
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,459
MARISHA: I turn to JB real quick.

417
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,897
MATT: Well, JB hasn't come down yet.

418
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:48,793
MARISHA: Oh.

419
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:53,269
MATT: Actually, while they're doing this, you guys
are waiting, kind of having your own meals, and

420
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,837
getting the day started. Eventually, you see
Johann come down the spiral stairs that lead back

421
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:06,465
to the main entryway to the castle, and behind,
you see JB helping Uncle Ogden down, step by step,

422
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:13,099
he still has his walking staff as he makes his way
down. And they slowly make their way into the

423
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:21,833
dining hall, sit down, and a simple meal of very,
very soft oatmeal is presented for Uncle Ogden at

424
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:28,306
their request before resting the night before, and
JB gets her breakfast, and Johann is proud of the

425
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:33,124
fact that he managed to acquire them, though it
was not much of an ordeal on his end. Goes and

426
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:36,684
joins Astra, and they seem to be eagerly awaiting
the eventuality of this tour that they're all

427
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:40,373
excited for. So you now can approach JB if you'd
like.

428
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:46,117
MARISHA: My question has been answered by their
arrival, so never mind.

429
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:48,680
SAM: Was it "What does JB stand for?"

430
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,624
TALIESIN: "What does JB eat?"

431
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:56,797
MARISHA: It was "How long does Ogden take to get
ready in the morning?" But now I know.

432
00:28:56,797 --> 00:29:00,115
LAURA: What does JB stand for?

433
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,461
TRAVIS: I have a question for Astra.

434
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,588
SAM: Junior Bacon Cheeseburger.

435
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:06,927
(laughter)

436
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,621
TRAVIS: Best name ever!

437
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,140
SAM: That is a great name.

438
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:19,419
TRAVIS: New favorite. Asterix, look, is there
anything in Whitestone that you would fancy? Like,

439
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:30,363
do you have any particular interests, whether they
be art or education or geometry or buildings?

440
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:38,323
MATT: "To be honest, I just kinda want to see the
history. I wanna see how long it's been here, I

441
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:44,140
"wanna see makes up the entirety of this crazy
place. I haven't been inside a castle before, so

442
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,944
"this is a new experience for me."

443
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:51,006
TRAVIS: Right. Did you want to see just the
castle, or did you want the grand deluxe Poobah

444
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:54,138
tour, which is around Whitestone as well?

445
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:55,995
MATT: "Well, how could I say no to that, honey?"

446
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:59,836
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, yeah, that was a
really good deal. Okay. Let me confer with my

447
00:29:59,836 --> 00:30:03,634
subordinate and we'll put together a tour
package.

448
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,235
MATT: "I'm excited!"

449
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,622
TRAVIS: Okay.

450
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,480
LAURA: She's a little bitch.

451
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,590
(laughter)

452
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,689
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy?

453
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,090
TALIESIN: Yes?

454
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:25,093
TRAVIS: So Asterix says that she wants history of
Whitestone and the castle, so like, I need a

455
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:31,595
hotlist of things that we're gonna show her, but
can we make it sound like I thought of it?

456
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:33,584
TALIESIN: Yes.

457
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,426
TRAVIS: Okay, good. Just keeping you on your toes,
mate.

458
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:41,884
LIAM: He's not talking to himself. We all have
earrings, he's talking to the others. If you were

459
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,586
wondering.

460
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:49,057
MATT: "Right. I'm not one to judge. I mean, you've
seen Ogden." And you glance over at Ogden, who's

461
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:53,945
now in the process of trying to comb the oatmeal
out of his beard while he's muttering below his

462
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:56,286
breath. (incoherent muttering)

463
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,384
LIAM: Are you coming with, buddy?

464
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,724
MATT: "What?"

465
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,579
LIAM: Do you want to go on the tour?

466
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,033
MATT: "Of course!"

467
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:10,759
LIAM: Huh. Can we borrow Trinket for that? Oh, Vex
isn't here. I'm sure we could borrow Trinket for

468
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,774
the day. You ever ridden a bear, old man?

469
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,828
MATT: (snoring)

470
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:18,103
TALIESIN: We actually have a carpet we were
thinking of using for this.

471
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:19,851
LIAM: The bear's funnier, though.

472
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,531
MARISHA: Hey, Vax?

473
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:25,397
LIAM: Hello? Oh, I'm right here.

474
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:27,266
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sitting next to you.

475
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:33,827
LIAM: Are we not actually in the castle right now?
Go ahead.

476
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:38,961
MARISHA: There's no ceiling. I think he fell
asleep with his eyes opened.

477
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:46,194
MATT: Which he did. He's staring at you, beginning
to snore loudly, and JB's like, "Ogden. Ogden."

478
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:51,165
She flicks him in the side of the head, and he
goes (chomps) and takes the spoon that she's

479
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,675
holding out with the oatmeal and just--

480
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,315
TRAVIS: I like him.

481
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:59,473
LIAM: I thought I'd get you a bear ride, but I was
wrong. I'm sorry.

482
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:01,546
MATT: "Get me a beer?"

483
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:05,087
LIAM: Yeah. Can we get three beers in here?

484
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:11,599
TRAVIS: Shit, we don't even need the servants for
that. I just pop out the chalice, little morning

485
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,085
beer. Sunrise.

486
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,091
LIAM: There you go. Three beers for you, Grandpa.

487
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:23,718
MARISHA: You know, I heard a recipe the other day
for a beer-mosa. It's like a mimosa, but with beer

488
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:29,071
and orange juice. Would you like a beer-mosa,
Ogden?

489
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,690
MATT: "No."

490
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,703
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

491
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,725
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Oh god.

492
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:42,180
MATT: And JB's like, "Ogden." She helps him put it
back down on the table.

493
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,801
"Ah. It's been years since I've had a good drink."

494
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,170
TRAVIS: Years?

495
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,464
MATT: "Yes."

496
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:53,220
LIAM: Oh, shit. Well, we're all gonna die. Have
another one.

497
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,858
MATT: And you can see JB's looking kind of
nervous. She's like,

498
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:58,884
"Actually, he probably shouldn't." And she takes 
him and pushes the drink toward Grog.

499
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:01,096
He's like, "I'm a grown boy!"

500
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:03,358
TRAVIS: He is, he's very grown.

501
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:10,784
MATT: She seems outnumbered and extremely
uncomfortable in the circumstance, as you look

502
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:20,833
over at Johann, who's like, (laughs) "Oh, this is
gonna be a fun tour, boy." As he watches as Uncle

503
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:30,887
Ogden lifts the, what by his size is rather large,
cup of... beer-- that's the one, it's been a long

504
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:34,704
week. Finishes it in three massive gulps, sets it
down.

505
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:39,345
LIAM: Man, I couldn't do that.

506
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:43,395
MARISHA: You know, I'm kind of sad I'm missing
this tour with you guys, now.

507
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,536
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fucked up.

508
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:47,017
MARISHA: Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

509
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:48,875
LIAM: The Grand Poobah tour? Yes, you are.

510
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:56,766
TRAVIS: Gohan, what happens when Uncle Ogden has
too much, you know, (drinking sound).

511
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:02,444
MATT: "I don't know. Honestly, he's been off the
wagon for about 20 years, so I'm curious to see."

512
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:06,097
LIAM: Well, this calls for a celebration.

513
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:09,168
MARISHA: What did we do? We're the worst!

514
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,310
TRAVIS: Life begins anew in Whitestone!

515
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:18,196
SAM: You know, 20 years to a gnome is like five
for a human.

516
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:20,615
MARISHA: We are consistently the worst.

517
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,940
SAM: I'm just saying, it could be okay.

518
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,212
LIAM: A very wise man once said that life needs
things to live, so.

519
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:30,684
TALIESIN: And one of those things it needs is
beer.

520
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:33,385
LAURA: He says, as we walk in the room.

521
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:36,768
MATT: Carrying a magnificent hat in your hand.

522
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:39,289
TRAVIS: Does Ogden seem to grow younger as he
finishes the beer?

523
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:43,229
MATT: No, he seems to grow the same.

524
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:46,069
TRAVIS: Okay. Never know. Never know.

525
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:47,749
MATT: He seems relatively unfazed.

526
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:50,397
LAURA: Grog! We found your tour hat.

527
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,436
TRAVIS: Oh, you did?

528
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:52,758
LAURA: And it's wonderful.

529
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,338
TRAVIS: Oh, great. When do I get to see it?

530
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:57,636
LAURA: It was sitting on a special shelf, labeled
'tour hat shelf'.

531
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:58,857
TRAVIS: That's lucky.

532
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:00,516
LAURA: Yeah. It really was.

533
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,740
SAM: Is that it? What you have there, Percy, that
hat?

534
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,852
TALIESIN: Yes, here we are.

535
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,179
LIAM: Oh, shit!

536
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,684
TALIESIN: Magnificent, isn't it?

537
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:15,596
TRAVIS: Wow! This is-- it jingles! It jangles!
This is an official Whitestone tour hat?

538
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:16,540
LAURA: Yeah!

539
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,477
TALIESIN: So that we can definitely find you no
matter what.

540
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:23,793
TRAVIS: Yeah! Now, is there a long history of
distinguished tour leaders before me?

541
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:28,174
TALIESIN: You would think that, but honestly, I
don't believe that we've ever had an official tour

542
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,844
guide before you. You would be starting!

543
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:32,391
LIAM: First Vex, now you!

544
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:36,444
LAURA: Grand Poobah and First Tour Captain of
Whitestone!

545
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:38,575
LIAM: All of This and That!

546
00:35:38,575 --> 00:35:41,676
TALIESIN: This technically falls under "This and
That," doesn't it?

547
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:49,649
MARISHA: Keyleth bows and I take Vax with me by
hitting the back of his knees.

548
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,642
TALIESIN: It's customary to show respect by
jingling the bells.

549
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:56,202
MATT: As you both bow, and you say this phrase,
you watch as Johann and Astra,

550
00:35:56,202 --> 00:35:59,915
they bow low as well.

551
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:04,359
TRAVIS: Yes. Percy, you should tell them the short
names for my titles. You know.

552
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,662
TALIESIN: I think it's just so much more exciting
when you say it.

553
00:36:07,662 --> 00:36:13,099
TRAVIS: What was it, like Silly Bean, and Sweet
Chestnut?

554
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,217
TALIESIN: Why not?

555
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:15,324
TRAVIS: Yeah!

556
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:17,305
(laughter)

557
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:20,815
TALIESIN: Grand Poobah of All of This and That

558
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,065
TRAVIS: Please rise, rise! It's going to be a
lovely day.

559
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,331
We have a lot ahead of us, we do. Please.

560
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:30,728
LIAM: Jeez, that hat is busier than K'Varn's whole
fucking--

561
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:31,891
LAURA: I know, right?

562
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:33,488
TRAVIS: Is it, like, well-balanced?

563
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:34,966
MATT: No! Not at all!

564
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,810
TRAVIS: I have to hold it?

565
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,977
MATT: No, here's the thing: it was designed for a
much smaller head. So, even for you to get it on,

566
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:50,800
it's like squeezing a tiny rubber thimble over
your thumb. So it's like (creaking, boop!). It

567
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,080
pops up on the very, very tip. So it holds itself,
but it only really covers the very, very top of

568
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,485
your head.

569
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,577
TRAVIS: I'd be worried about circulation up there,
but it's not really a concern.

570
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:04,889
MATT: You feel like it might fall off, but
eventually you find a little strap inside.

571
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,082
TRAVIS: Ooh!

572
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:07,752
LAURA: Hey!

573
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:09,132
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

574
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:11,211
(laughter)

575
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,076
LIAM: Ding, ding-a-ling, doodle-ding!

576
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:15,828
TRAVIS: I was cool until the strap came in.

577
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:18,347
TALIESIN: Breaking point!

578
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:20,625
TRAVIS: I hate those fucking straps!

579
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,122
TALIESIN: The breaking point is right beneath your
chin! Who knew!

580
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:24,603
SAM: Birthday hat!

581
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,301
TALIESIN: Been searching for years!

582
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:35,402
MATT: And as the strap finds itself solid across
your jawline, the gnomes, one by one, line up

583
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:41,914
behind you, looking at you excitedly, Ogden and JB
at the rear, and he's like, "What's going on?"

584
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:47,858
TALIESIN: We pull out the carpet, and invite Ogden
and JB.

585
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,470
LAURA: Please, take a seat!

586
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,554
LIAM: Yes, it's no bear, but it's pretty good.

587
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:59,632
MATT: You see Johann and Astra, arm-in-arm, walk
to the side, and as JB takes the arm of Uncle

588
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:03,958
Ogden, walks him forward. He stumbles up in your
direction, looks up, and goes,

589
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:10,992
"That's terrible! Where are we going?"

590
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:15,073
TRAVIS: It is time for the tour of Whitestone!

591
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:16,540
MATT: "Yay!"

592
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,107
(laughter)

593
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:21,026
MATT: JB pats him and is like, "He's not very good
with the volume control."

594
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:26,108
TRAVIS: Oh, that's okay. I like it when they're
loud, actually, I relate.

595
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:27,588
TALIESIN: I understand.

596
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:28,469
TRAVIS: Yep.

597
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,839
LAURA: Which one of you two will be riding the
carpet with them?

598
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,408
LIAM: Of the Grand Poobah and myself?

599
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:38,487
LAURA: Of you and Percy. Percy's going with you as
well, aren't you? Are you?

600
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,812
Or are you coming with us?

601
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:41,302
LIAM: The carpet's above my station.

602
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,426
GROG: Yeah, I can't ride; I've developed a tour
walk.

603
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,564
LAURA: Someone has to ride the carpet with them.

604
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:51,185
TALIESIN: I'll ride the carpet so that you can
stay free for, yes. Right.

605
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:52,696
MARISHA: Oh, she's coming with us.

606
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,124
TALIESIN: I know, I know.

607
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,423
MARISHA: You're on your own.

608
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:56,328
TALIESIN: I'll be fine.

609
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:57,234
LAURA: My darling.

610
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:57,939
TALIESIN: Yes?

611
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:58,876
LAURA: You'll be fine.

612
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:00,903
TALIESIN: Oh god.

613
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:06,875
TRAVIS: All right, Percy, time to learn about your
castle. And I take off in a walk where you don't

614
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:13,960
bend your knees, your legs just stay straight?
That's the walk I'm adopting for this whole tour.

615
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,803
MATT: All right.

616
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:16,849
TRAVIS: I've decided.

617
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:18,694
LAURA: Like, legs going out to the side there?

618
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:21,363
TRAVIS: No, like you kick your heel forward,
like--

619
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:23,461
SAM: Like a goose-step?

620
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,814
TRAVIS: Like a military.

621
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:26,464
SAM: Goose-stepping?

622
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,685
MARISHA: I don't think you want to do a
goose-step.

623
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,858
TRAVIS: No, I'm doing it.

624
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:32,232
TALIESIN: I'm okay with it.

625
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:32,980
MARISHA: You sure?

626
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,933
TALIESIN: Let's roll with this.

627
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:34,668
MARISHA: Okay!

628
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:36,108
TALIESIN: I'm totally fucking down. I'm in.

629
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:40,178
LIAM: As we head out, I run over to Keyleth and
say, try not to be too jealous! And I give her a

630
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,886
smooch and then I chase after the gang.

631
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:43,670
MARISHA: Have fun!

632
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,961
LIAM: Oh, I will!

633
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:51,282
MATT: All right. So the three of you find your
way, borrowing the carpet temporarily, you gather

634
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:57,808
the gnomes. So, wait, who-- the weight of all the
gnomes, the goliath--

635
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:59,237
TRAVIS: I'm walking!

636
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:00,411
MATT: You're walking.

637
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:01,681
LAURA: It's just Percy and the gnomes.

638
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,693
TALIESIN: It's just me like, like a gondola
driver.

639
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,270
MARISHA: Yes, and Grog is like sherpa-ing.

640
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,053
MATT: All right. So.

641
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:12,443
LIAM: My plan is to act casual but to be watching
all the gnomes for thieving things.

642
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:20,339
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. All right. So. As you all
leap onto the carpet except for Grog, Grog, you

643
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:24,085
begin taking them around the grounds. You begin
through the castle. Where do you want to begin?

644
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:32,218
TRAVIS: Oh this foyer of Whitestone Castle was
defended by myself and these fellows against the

645
00:40:32,218 --> 00:40:41,864
onslaught of dragons, giants, and hordes of
undead. It has been in the de Rolo family for

646
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,272
millennia.

647
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:48,739
SAM: Millennia? That last word?

648
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,864
TRAVIS: Is that what the word is? Yep. Yep.

649
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:53,087
(laughter)

650
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:59,311
TRAVIS: And then I take them outside to get some
fresh air before I overwhelm them with knowledge.

651
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:03,230
MATT: (laughs) All right. The carpet glides you
guys to the outskirts of the castle. You begin

652
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:09,116
taking them along the grounds, around the
perimeter wall, and then through one of the

653
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:13,789
underneath gates to the back garden, which you've
recovered, and are now starting to actually grow

654
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:20,442
again. You have like a small hedge maze back
there, some rose gardens, and a small pond. You've

655
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:25,141
filled in the exhaust holes that were used for the
distillation of the whitestone and the acid pits

656
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:30,840
that were installed by the Briarwoods. Now it is
actually a garden once more. And so as this

657
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,868
happens, you watch as Astra gets really excited at
the edge of the carpet and is like, "Ooh my, look

658
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,291
"at this place, it's like natural!"

659
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,819
LAURA: (laughs) 'It's like natural.'

660
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:46,593
TRAVIS: Natural beauty, it abounds. It all comes
from the Sun Tree in the center of town.

661
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:48,258
(whispers) Percy, help!

662
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:53,698
TALIESIN: The gardens were originally constructed
by Melanie de Rolo, who is actually one of more

663
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:58,128
interesting de Rolos of the time. She was of the
third generation to be born into this castle--

664
00:41:58,128 --> 00:41:59,811
MATT: (snores)

665
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,089
(laughter)

666
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,945
MATT: Uncle Ogden is just staring forward.

667
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,388
TALIESIN: Don't know why I bother. Melanie is--

668
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:07,149
TRAVIS: Asterisk is interested.

669
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:14,055
TALIESIN: -- Melanie was actually fascinating. She
was eventually removed from her position for

670
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:20,868
accusations of witchcraft and raising of the
undead. There's actually quite a bit of

671
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:23,338
interesting ghost stories if that's your sort
of--

672
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:26,173
TRAVIS: No, no we don't, we don't, nope, no.

673
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:30,220
MATT: "No, please, that's interesting!" Johann is
like, "Ghost stories, you say, huh?"

674
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:37,523
TALIESIN: Oh yes, the strange materials that are
mined in this part of the world have given rise to

675
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:45,407
all sorts of stories due to its pale appearance,
the fact that under certain types of moonlight it

676
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:50,111
can glow with a strange phosphorescent
supernatural glow.

677
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:52,379
There are even tales of people--

678
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:53,706
MATT: (snores)

679
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:59,008
TALIESIN: -- seeing several of the more notorious
de Rolos as spirits wandering about the halls,

680
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:04,459
Melanie just being one of them. But she was very
excited by the notion of a garden and actually,

681
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,891
originally, many of these paths were--

682
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:09,802
MATT: Both of the gnomes now turn back to Grog and
go, "Anyway, what's next on the tour?"

683
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:10,801
TALIESIN: Thank you.

684
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:12,085
(laughter)

685
00:43:12,085 --> 00:43:14,069
TRAVIS: Enough with, like, the boring shit.

686
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:15,392
TALIESIN: I could keep going.

687
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,295
TRAVIS: Do we have like an armory that we can
bring them, where they make weapons?

688
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,916
SAM: Yeah, yeah! Get to the good shit!

689
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:32,745
TALIESIN: Well, actually, why don't we take them
to target practice? I'm sure that the Riflemen are

690
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:36,194
probably at least doing a round of target
practice. That might be fun to see.

691
00:43:36,194 --> 00:43:38,086
LIAM: Do we get to see the Musketeers?

692
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,782
TALIESIN: I'm not allowed to call them that
anymore.

693
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:41,872
LIAM: Well, I will. Let's go!

694
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:44,959
MATT: Johann is like, "I like the sound of target
practice, that's right up my alley.

695
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,182
"Take us there, boy!"

696
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:57,072
TRAVIS: Okay. We now venture along these roads
cast through the ages of de Rolo descendants as we

697
00:43:57,072 --> 00:44:04,262
make our way to the annals of Firecracker Alley.

698
00:44:04,262 --> 00:44:06,052
(laughter)

699
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:10,473
TALIESIN: It's a shooting alley. It's fun, it's
got some moving bits, but I'm sure you can

700
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,484
understand exactly what it entails.

701
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,347
MATT: They both shake their head. "I have no idea
what you're talking about, but let's go!"

702
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:19,988
TALIESIN: This is quite possibly the only one in
existence, so this is quite exciting.

703
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:24,635
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way along
the rest of the tour, the rest of you, who are not

704
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:27,109
on this tour, what are you doing?

705
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:29,301
LAURA: We're going to the Sun Tree!

706
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:31,176
MARISHA: We're gonna go find Wilhand!

707
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:32,392
ASHLEY: We're gonna go find Wilhand.

708
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:36,704
MARISHA: We're gonna go find Willhand!

709
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,318
MATT: Okay.

710
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,135
ASHLEY: Before I left, did I see Grog in his hat?

711
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:43,587
MATT: Oh, it was amazing.

712
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:49,257
ASHLEY: Grog, you look so distinguished!

713
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:50,693
TRAVIS: Go on.

714
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:55,271
ASHLEY: You look so great in that hat! Where did
you get this hat?

715
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:59,357
TRAVIS: Apparently this is the official tour hat
of the house of Whitestone.

716
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:00,491
LAURA: It's the truth!

717
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,846
TRAVIS: And apparently I'm the first.

718
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:08,693
LAURA: Yep, it was made hundreds of years ago, and
was just sitting on the shelf waiting for the

719
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,118
first official tour guide.

720
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:12,955
TRAVIS: How it's not covered in dust or decay, I
have no idea.

721
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:17,139
ASHLEY: Oh, Grog. This is just the perfect job for
you.

722
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:19,659
TRAVIS: Does it fit well? I feel like it's a bit
small.

723
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:23,666
ASHLEY: You know what? It's just supposed to be a
little jaunty like that, I think.

724
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,893
TRAVIS: Oh, it's got a little swagger?

725
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:26,633
ASHLEY: Yeah, just a little-- it's great.

726
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,307
TALIESIN: Makes you look bigger as well.

727
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:29,296
ASHLEY: Yes.

728
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:33,669
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am pretty tiny these days. I have
not been lifting.

729
00:45:33,669 --> 00:45:38,069
MARISHA: Is he wearing like a Lolita hat? Is that
what's going on?

730
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,961
TRAVIS: Like a maid cafe?

731
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:47,750
MATT: Kind of, a very oversized one. It's
wide-brimmed and floppy and it's got all these

732
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,736
ribbons cascading.

733
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:51,029
TRAVIS: I like the Derby analogy. That's what I
was going for.

734
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:54,854
MARISHA: Derby Week is this weekend, I think.

735
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:56,567
MATT: Timely. There you go, Grog.

736
00:45:56,567 --> 00:46:00,333
MARISHA: You look like an old Southern white
woman.

737
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,589
TRAVIS: All I aim for in life.

738
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:06,254
MATT: So Vex, Pike, Keyleth, Taryon. What are you
guys doing?

739
00:46:06,254 --> 00:46:08,281
LAURA: We're heading to the Sun Tree.

740
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:14,643
MATT: All right. You make your way to the Sun
Tree. It's about ten in the morning, time-wise, by

741
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:19,056
the time you get going, and you see them kind of
gliding around the outskirts of the castle, doing

742
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:23,702
their slow traveling tour. As you approach the Sun
Tree, where are you going? Heading to Westruun?

743
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:26,484
ASHLEY: Let's go see him.

744
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:33,374
MARISHA: Do you know of a tree that's close by his
house that we can just be right there?

745
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:37,439
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, in the backyard we have a
pretty large tree.

746
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:39,966
MARISHA: Can I get us to that tree?

747
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,533
MATT: You've seen it before. You've been to the
house, you've stayed there, so you know the tree

748
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:44,638
she mentions, yeah.

749
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:47,565
MARISHA: Okay. That tree. Psew!

750
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:50,715
MATT: All right, as you guys step through the
portal created on the outskirts of the Sun Tree,

751
00:46:50,715 --> 00:46:56,867
you step through into-- I wouldn't say it's a
yard, it's not a big yard, it's more of a small--

752
00:46:56,867 --> 00:47:01,163
what would be used as a storage space behind this
building, but you have the two-story red brick

753
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:08,697
building that is your-- and, for a while, Grog's--
home of upbringing. Wilhand is not in the

754
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:12,932
backyard, however, you do see that there is a lot
of leftover building materials from the

755
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:19,270
reconstruction of the second story, which
sustained damage from the original assault of the

756
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:24,708
Conclave. But looking up at the roof, which last
you saw was amid disarray, looks like it's been

757
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,078
reconstructed and completed, and the home is once
again whole.

758
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:40,965
ASHLEY: Well, this is nice to see. It's put
together again. Well. Shall we?

759
00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:42,450
LAURA: Find out about that curse.

760
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,011
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay.

761
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:50,656
MATT: You knock on the door. There's a slight
pause. A little voice inside goes,

762
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:53,889
"Eh? Who is it?"

763
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:56,907
ASHLEY: Oh, Wilhand, it's Pike!

764
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,279
MATT: "In the yard?"

765
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:04,915
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, we-- I just went around.

766
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:11,164
(laughter)

767
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:12,647
ASHLEY: Just went around.

768
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:15,023
MARISHA: The gate was open, the side gate.

769
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:16,459
ASHLEY: The gate was open.

770
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:17,825
SAM: The dog run?

771
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:21,538
ASHLEY: And the dog run. Just went around the dog
run.

772
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:27,276
MARISHA: No, the back door, the back door!

773
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:30,900
MATT: Another moment passes before the back door
opens, which leads into the small kitchen. It's a

774
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:38,410
humble home, but as it opens up, Wilhand is there,
looking as liver-spotted and grinning as he was

775
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:47,280
last you saw him. His balding top of his head and
the crazed white mane of hair behind has gotten

776
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,216
even longer and unkempt as he's now on his own and
doesn't have anyone to really groom him. So he's

777
00:48:54,216 --> 00:49:05,095
going a little wild-gnome right now. You see his
face light up immediately as soon as he sees your

778
00:49:05,095 --> 00:49:09,011
expression. "Oh, Pike! Pike, it's so good--"

779
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:14,287
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm very strong.

780
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:19,863
MATT: "I noticed. Well, friends."

781
00:49:19,863 --> 00:49:22,166
LAURA: Good to see you again!

782
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,849
MATT: "Dex'avlia?"

783
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,012
LAURA: That's right.

784
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:26,262
MATT: "And that's Keyfen?"

785
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:27,127
MARISHA: Got it.

786
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:28,154
MATT: "And?"

787
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:32,593
SAM: Taryon Darrington. In Gnome, I say, it's a
pleasure to make your a-taint-ance.

788
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:35,843
(laughter)

789
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:46,500
MATT: His eyes go wide. "Ah. I almost heard that.
Well, come in, come in." He turns around and

790
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,816
muscles his way inside. You've never quite been in
a gnome home before.

791
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:53,341
SAM: You grew up here?

792
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:57,100
ASHLEY: For the most part. For the most part.

793
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,473
SAM: And you seem okay.

794
00:49:59,473 --> 00:50:09,102
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yes. I'm okay. And Grog did a
little bit as well.

795
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:12,824
SAM: That's hard to believe.

796
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:19,852
ASHLEY: Well, he-- we made it work, you know? He
slept outside a lot.

797
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:22,203
LAURA: He was smaller then, too, right?

798
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:25,244
ASHLEY: He was smaller then. He was smaller then.
He, you know.

799
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:30,479
MARISHA: I loved sleeping outside, though. Did you
guys have like a tree canopy thing?

800
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:32,407
ASHLEY: Sometimes we would make forts.

801
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:36,196
MARISHA: That's good living, Taryon.

802
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:40,961
SAM: That sounds fun, sleeping outside when you
have a perfectly good home to sleep in.

803
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:45,052
ASHLEY: Well, it's-- I'm an outdoorsy type.

804
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:45,896
SAM: All right.

805
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:49,784
ASHLEY: People have different preferences, and
that's one.

806
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:51,069
MARISHA: It's very freeing.

807
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:52,767
SAM: I'll have to try it sometime.

808
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,913
ASHLEY: We'll try it sometime. I think you'll like
it.

809
00:50:54,913 --> 00:50:57,906
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you watch as Wilhand is rushing around the

810
00:50:57,906 --> 00:51:02,602
kitchen, frantically trying to make tea. He's
like, "I wasn't expecting guests, my apologies!

811
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:09,816
"Hold on!" He's like, one hand he's filling this
tea kettle, and the other hand's trying to find

812
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,693
some flint, and he's like--

813
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:19,629
MARISHA: I light it up with my flame hands.

814
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:20,789
MATT: "I did it!"

815
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,587
(laughter)

816
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:29,261
MATT: Sets it down. "Okay." He goes and sets the
kettle onto the flame. "Don't touch. It burns.

817
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:35,223
"Anyway. I'm so glad you could make it. It's so
good to see you, Pike!"

818
00:51:35,223 --> 00:51:40,814
ASHLEY: It's so good to see you. Sit and relax, I
know where everything is, you don't have to-- I'll

819
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:44,094
get tea ready for everybody. Just sit and relax.

820
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:46,071
MATT: "Okay." And he sits down at the table.

821
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:54,906
LAURA: As she gets up, can I just kind of whisper,
'cause he can't hear very well. Wilhand? Can you

822
00:51:54,906 --> 00:52:04,845
hear what I'm saying right now? Okay. Is it going
to be all right, bringing this up around him?

823
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,627
ASHLEY: Sure.

824
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:08,088
LAURA: Sore subject? Maybe.

825
00:52:08,088 --> 00:52:10,494
ASHLEY: I'm not sure. Bring it up very, very
lightly.

826
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,596
LAURA: I'll let you do it.

827
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:17,918
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Wilhand.

828
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:18,945
MATT: "Yes?"

829
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:25,507
ASHLEY: First of all, I wanted to come see you
'cause it's been some time, and I'm so glad that

830
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:29,188
the house has come along so nicely.

831
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:35,533
MATT: "It has. There's been some fantastic
volunteers who've come by. They've rebuilt a lot

832
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:36,711
"of the city."

833
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:41,121
ASHLEY: That's fantastic. Oh, I know what we were
gonna ask you.

834
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:42,370
MATT: "Yes?"

835
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:48,059
ASHLEY: Oh, wait. No, we knew Fassbender was gone.
Never mind.

836
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,348
MATT: "Okay."

837
00:52:49,348 --> 00:52:54,439
LAURA: Oh, but what did the man look like who came
and grabbed the big robot?

838
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,818
TRAVIS: (whispers) The guy that owned him.

839
00:52:55,818 --> 00:53:01,933
LAURA: I know, I just want to make sure it was
him. Your big mustachioed metal man.

840
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:07,952
MATT: "Oh, yes. The broad stone one."

841
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,245
LAURA: Yeah, that's the one.

842
00:53:09,245 --> 00:53:16,680
MATT: "Ah. He was retrieved by his actual legal
owner, of which I was notified of. I don't know

843
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:24,215
"how you procured it off of him. Older gentleman.
Standard human fare. Taller than me."

844
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:26,400
LAURA: Was he kind of a dick?

845
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,648
MATT: "Kind of a what?"

846
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:31,346
MARISHA: A penis!

847
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:32,581
TRAVIS: Wow.

848
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:33,843
(laughter)

849
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:34,927
TRAVIS: Jesus.

850
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:43,573
MATT: You watch as his head turns in a confused
way. He goes, "Um." And he puts his finger in his

851
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:46,518
ear and clears it out and goes, "I'm sorry,
what?"

852
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:50,517
ASHLEY: Like not a very nice person?

853
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:52,364
MATT: "Oh, yes, he was--"

854
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:54,155
ASHLEY: Rude.

855
00:53:54,155 --> 00:54:04,330
MATT: "-- a bit... he was not the kindest or most
forthcoming of guests, but he seemed to be a busy

856
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:09,383
"man of much esteem and left before I could finish
making his tea."

857
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:11,645
LAURA: I hope he wasn't very mean to you.

858
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:14,914
MATT: "No, no, not mean at all, just extremely
forceful."

859
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:19,354
(laughter)

860
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:29,402
ASHLEY: Well, we came-- well, first, I wanted you
to meet Taryon, our new friend.

861
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:31,842
MATT: "Oh! What's your name?"

862
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:33,808
SAM: Taryon Darrington.

863
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:35,711
MATT: "Taryon. Pleasure to meet you."

864
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:38,929
SAM: Yes, it's a pleasure to make your
a-cunt-ance. A-cunt-ance.

865
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:40,957
LAURA: Wow. Wow.

866
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:50,933
MATT: He leans over and goes, "You're making
interesting friends these days, Pike."

867
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:54,486
ASHLEY: Well, okay, I'm just gonna--

868
00:54:54,486 --> 00:55:04,908
MATT: "Sarenrae was very specific about making
sure that you avoid the bad folk, and you're

869
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:10,888
"currently dealing with what looks to be some
ruffians using some naughty language."

870
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,451
MARISHA: Is 'penis' a bad word?

871
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:15,867
LAURA: Just don't say that word again, Keyleth. I
mean, it's not.

872
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:24,069
ASHLEY: You know, I just feel like I like to be
surrounded by all types, to sort of, you know, get

873
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:25,263
to know--

874
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:27,019
MATT: (laughs) "Just messing with you."

875
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,155
ASHLEY: Oh. I thought you got--

876
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:35,785
MATT: "What, you think I didn't get drunk and say
the off thing here and there? Back in my day, I

877
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:40,744
"was a bit of a rabble-rouser, whether you believe
it or not. Mm-hm."

878
00:55:40,744 --> 00:55:43,953
ASHLEY: You were.

879
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:49,301
(laughter)

880
00:55:49,301 --> 00:56:05,087
ASHLEY: Well, I might as well just come out with
it. I'm stalling. So we had some visitors in

881
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:10,072
Whitestone, where we're staying right now-- I'm
just really nervous.

882
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:19,074
It was Johann and Ogden and JB.

883
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:21,316
MATT: "Hm."

884
00:56:21,316 --> 00:56:29,681
ASHLEY: They came to visit, 'cause I had sent them
a little money and a letter.

885
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,866
MATT: "Well, that's very kind of you."

886
00:56:32,866 --> 00:56:44,322
ASHLEY: And they came to town to stay and to just
see the town, and they told me something a little

887
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:59,255
disturbing. Ogden said he's been having visions
and dreams about something about a blood curse.

888
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:06,867
Does this sound familiar to you at all?

889
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:20,637
MATT: "To be perfectly up-front, I kind of escaped
the Trickfoot lifestyle when I was maybe about

890
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:30,865
"your age. So I'm not as keen on all the familial
history, but I can say that there's been more than

891
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,497
"one curse thrown at our family name."

892
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:35,691
ASHLEY: This is true.

893
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:46,762
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't spoken with them in
quite some time, or really anybody else. I decided

894
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:54,480
"that you, there was something special about you,
and it wasn't right to have you grow up in such an

895
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:02,942
"uncouth environment, so I wanted to provide
something different for you. I don't know if I

896
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:10,495
"succeeded, but I did my best, and brought you into
the light of the one that saved me. And look at

897
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:16,546
"you now!" And he leans forward and grabs your holy
symbol from the front and goes, "Why, you're the

898
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:20,293
"brightest star she has."

899
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:24,252
LAURA: I'm gonna be terrible. Can I insight check
him? I just want to see if it looks like he's

900
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,390
hiding anything.

901
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,068
MATT: Make an insight check.

902
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,796
LAURA: (high-pitched) I'm sorry, Wilhand.

903
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,804
ASHLEY: It's okay.

904
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:32,840
SAM: He's an old man. He doesn't lie.

905
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,965
LAURA: 14?

906
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:48,081
MATT: 14? He's hard to read in the sense that he's
lived long enough and seen enough things in his

907
00:58:48,081 --> 00:59:00,631
time that he's open, but he keeps his history
guarded, by nature. He seems genuine, but at the

908
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:05,443
same time, you're not getting the whole picture,
because he's not revealing the whole picture. He

909
00:59:05,443 --> 00:59:09,880
also spends a lot of time alone, too, so by nature
he's a little hermited. So that's as much as you

910
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,366
can make out.

911
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:17,466
LAURA: Wilhand, how old were you when you left the
Trickfoot family?

912
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:23,270
MATT: "Oh, I would've been maybe in my early
40s."

913
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,429
LAURA: Oh. (whispers) How old are you?

914
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,372
ASHLEY: Early 40s.

915
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:36,211
LAURA: Okay. Okay. So he was around for a while.
Okay. Did you know Theobold?

916
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:41,501
MATT: "Yes."

917
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:45,969
LAURA: And so do you know what happened to him?

918
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:50,026
MATT: "In what way?"

919
00:59:50,026 --> 00:59:57,124
LAURA: Well, Ogden said he was affected by the
curse, that he was killed by it.

920
00:59:57,124 --> 00:59:59,910
MATT: "I wasn't around for that."

921
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,190
MARISHA: Insight check.

922
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,835
MATT: Make an insight check.

923
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:14,102
MARISHA: 24. No. Hang on, wait wait wait. I keep
forgetting my insight went up.

924
01:00:14,162 --> 01:00:16,159
SAM: Well. It seems to have worked.

925
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:17,162
MARISHA: 26.

926
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:18,602
LIAM: Oh, he turned around.

927
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:20,478
(laughter)

928
01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:22,376
SAM: Whispers. We have nothing to sell.

929
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:24,625
LAURA: Yes we do! We have these shirts that are
still in the store.

930
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,418
SAM: Oh! Those shirts there?

931
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,559
TRAVIS: Been out for a week.

932
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,908
ASHLEY: You can even fold up the sleeves to make
them super fashionable.

933
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:34,768
LAURA: They're super cool!

934
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:36,315
LIAM: And soft like the hoodie.

935
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,672
TRAVIS: Show 'em the dice on the back

936
01:00:37,672 --> 01:00:40,720
LAURA: (squeaky) There's a Critical Role logo on
the back.

937
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,204
(laughter)

938
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:45,402
TRAVIS: That's the house voice. When we go home,
it's all that.

939
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:47,882
SAM: Really? That's how she talks at home? Oh,
boy.

940
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:52,506
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's what we call the Bailey
switch. Got home and it was like, fuck.

941
01:00:52,506 --> 01:01:10,956
MATT: "I'm sorry. I just, I don't deal with them
much these days. They wander, they-- I'm just an

942
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:20,972
"old gnome trying to live his twilight years in
peace and the joy of the Everlight."

943
01:01:20,972 --> 01:01:35,155
ASHLEY: So, I don't mean to press you on this,
Wilhand, but did you know how he died? I mean,

944
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:40,017
even if you weren't there, did you hear about it?

945
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:48,206
MATT: "I know that he had passed and I heard it
was around mysterious circumstances, but like many

946
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:55,995
"Trickfoots before me and many after, they tend to
die under mysterious circumstances. It's kind of

947
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:57,598
"the life they lead."

948
01:01:57,598 --> 01:02:03,058
MARISHA: Wilhand, if you don't mind me asking.

949
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:04,462
MATT: "There we are, yes?"

950
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:15,004
MARISHA: I know you mentioned to Pike before about
a blood curse. Do you actually believe in the

951
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:20,320
curse or do you believe that it's because of the
life the Trickfoots lead? I know you've worked

952
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,939
hard to get away from them.

953
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:29,364
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't delved too deep
into the history of the family. That's more

954
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:38,081
"Ogden's fare. I just wanted to leave it all behind
me. For the most part, I don't even tell people

955
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:46,448
"I'm a Trickfoot. They just know me as old Wilhand.
Don't want to live under the stigma. Sorry, I wish

956
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:49,880
"I could be of more help."

957
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,588
ASHLEY: I'm struggling a bit.

958
01:02:53,588 --> 01:02:56,723
MATT: "What bothers you, child?"

959
01:02:56,723 --> 01:03:17,192
ASHLEY: I feel like you've told me so much about
the family, and when they came to town I feel-- I

960
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:28,076
almost feel bad about the way that I treated them.
And I feel like they're just, if anything, they're

961
01:03:28,076 --> 01:03:37,390
just odd. I'm odd and you're odd and that's just
the way Trickfoots are.

962
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:43,405
MATT: "That's the way family is. Those closest to
you are usually the most odd."

963
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:45,077
LAURA: It's very true.

964
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:54,239
MATT: "There've been very upstanding people in our
family in the past, and there've been some

965
01:03:54,239 --> 01:04:03,906
"downright scoundrels. We're as varied as any other
folk in Exandria. It just so happens that some of

966
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:14,140
"the scoundrels had a higher profile in the past
and set us on a path of expectation. Besides, for

967
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:22,523
"gnomes outside of Kraghammer, it's hard to make a
living outside of farming or courier services and

968
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:31,794
"other menial tasks. Tinkering seems to be already
a very cluttered business. So how else are they

969
01:04:31,794 --> 01:04:36,788
"going to make their means, I suppose, than
pilfering here and there? I don't blame them for

970
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:40,107
"that. I just don't want to live it and didn't wish
for you to live it either."

971
01:04:40,107 --> 01:04:50,190
ASHLEY: Well, I thank you for that. I couldn't
imagine my life any different.

972
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:56,138
MATT: "I just hope it was enough-- you and the
mountain man."

973
01:04:56,138 --> 01:05:01,954
ASHLEY: Well, he's my protector for sure.

974
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:09,129
MATT: "Good. I was hoping he would be. He was my
protector at one time, as well."

975
01:05:09,129 --> 01:05:15,308
LAURA: It might be a small comfort to know that
Pike's doing a wonderful job of changing the

976
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:17,580
Trickfoot name.

977
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,950
MATT: "Really?"

978
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:26,360
LAURA: She's a hero of the land. Trickfoot is
known as hero, now.

979
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,442
MATT: "Hero? What did you do?"

980
01:05:30,442 --> 01:05:42,480
ASHLEY: Well. I mean, I didn't do it, we all did,
but we killed lots of dragons, and, you know,

981
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,409
we've done some pretty cool things.

982
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:50,659
LAURA: She's saved a lot of people.

983
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:58,142
MARISHA: Plus she single-handedly helped lead the
rebuilding of a Sarenrae temple in Vasselheim.

984
01:05:58,142 --> 01:06:00,658
MATT: "Way over in Vasselheim?"

985
01:06:00,658 --> 01:06:02,724
ASHLEY: I've traveled very far.

986
01:06:02,724 --> 01:06:09,470
MATT: "You've made the Lady of the Everlight very
proud of you, then." (laughs)

987
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:19,380
SAM: She also owns a bakery. Co-owns a bakery.
With the rest of us. And she is one of the finest

988
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,879
bakers we have.

989
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:23,634
LAURA: It's true. It's true.

990
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:25,573
MATT: "Where did you learn to bake?"

991
01:06:25,573 --> 01:06:34,949
ASHLEY: It just-- I think-- (laughs) I don't know.
I think over, you know, this past year--

992
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,995
(laughter)

993
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:46,950
ASHLEY: We would drink a lot, and we would just be
in the kitchen sometimes without anything to do,

994
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:53,072
us girls and Taryon, just throwing some shit in a
bowl and seeing what we could make.

995
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:55,534
SAM: The best bakers make it up as they go.

996
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:57,371
MATT: "You're all very lucky."

997
01:06:57,371 --> 01:07:00,008
LAURA: It's not a very precise sort of thing, it's
funny, mix things together

998
01:07:00,008 --> 01:07:01,571
and then it just turns out.

999
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:06,267
SAM: We don't even have measuring cups, we just
kinda pour it all in and shake it up and see what

1000
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:07,667
comes out.

1001
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,031
MATT: "That sounds amazing."

1002
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:17,573
ASHLEY: Here, here, I have-- it's only half 'cause
I ate half of it in our journey through the tree.

1003
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:19,460
(laughter)

1004
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,270
SAM: It literally took five minutes to get here.

1005
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,416
ASHLEY: But it's half of a blondie that was made
yesterday.

1006
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:28,861
MATT: "Did you make this?"

1007
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:32,409
ASHLEY: Well, no, I mean, he was making them, but
it's our recipe.

1008
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:37,616
SAM: I made it off of a recipe that she had
cultivated, and it's quite-- you'll taste--

1009
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:40,547
ASHLEY: I go and get some tea, make the rest of
the tea for everybody.

1010
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:41,854
MATT: "Oh, the tea!"

1011
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:45,063
ASHLEY: I got it, I got it. Sit, sit, enjoy. Here,
here.

1012
01:07:45,063 --> 01:07:46,683
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

1013
01:07:46,683 --> 01:07:52,595
MATT: "It's a bit stale. Mm."

1014
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:56,983
LAURA: Imagine if it was fresh.

1015
01:07:56,983 --> 01:08:01,615
MATT: "You're a very good cleric."

1016
01:08:01,615 --> 01:08:07,477
ASHLEY: You know, I know, thank you for your
honesty, they're great when they're fresh.

1017
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:09,207
MATT: "I'll finish this later."

1018
01:08:09,207 --> 01:08:13,504
ASHLEY: I'll bring you a profiterolo, 'cause that
you will love.

1019
01:08:13,504 --> 01:08:18,148
MATT: "I've gotta cut down, you know, the
diabetes."

1020
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:23,872
(laughter)

1021
01:08:23,872 --> 01:08:28,593
MATT: "But thank you, I greatly appreciate the
offer. A bakery? Wow!"

1022
01:08:28,593 --> 01:08:30,520
TRAVIS: The old gnome diabetes!

1023
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:46,774
ASHLEY: I could maybe try and heal you of that.
Well, just one more thing. So Ogden, in his

1024
01:08:46,774 --> 01:09:04,599
visions that he's been having, and he told this to
Vex, that he saw visions of me dying, basically,

1025
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:10,853
by a shadowy--

1026
01:09:10,853 --> 01:09:14,875
LAURA: Shadowy being with eyes like burning coal.

1027
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:20,940
MATT: "Well, you'd best be avoiding anything with
eyes like coals."

1028
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,595
LAURA: Right.

1029
01:09:22,595 --> 01:09:30,611
MATT: "Dreams are dreams. Visions are different.
Now, was it a dream he had, or was it a vision?"

1030
01:09:30,611 --> 01:09:36,218
LAURA: It's a recurring dream, very constant, and
it has him very worried,

1031
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:37,689
if he's telling the truth.

1032
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:42,772
MATT: "Do you know if Ogden has found faith?"

1033
01:09:42,772 --> 01:09:46,569
ASHLEY: I didn't ask him.

1034
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:59,208
MATT: "Well. I can't say. Some given the calling,
they don't know why that is given. I'd like to

1035
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:10,817
"think that even the most dastardly of characters
can be redeemed. My memory of their family is a

1036
01:10:10,817 --> 01:10:20,341
"dark one, but who am I to judge, as I have not
engaged with their path for hundreds of years now?

1037
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,726
"Maybe you should ask him."

1038
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:27,037
ASHLEY: Okay.

1039
01:10:27,037 --> 01:10:32,506
MARISHA: Why do you think Ogden is dastardly? What
did he do?

1040
01:10:32,506 --> 01:10:36,235
MATT: "I don't know him that well, I left before
we got to become friends."

1041
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:39,440
MARISHA: Just going off what you said.

1042
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,578
MATT: "Just meaning the Trickfoots in general."

1043
01:10:42,578 --> 01:10:55,820
ASHLEY: So would it be-- (laughs) Would it be
different if he had these dreams or visions if he

1044
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:00,279
was a follower of Sarenrae or has found faith of
some sort?

1045
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:04,002
MATT: "Well, those are the only visions I've
received, and they've kept you safe this long,

1046
01:11:04,002 --> 01:11:12,802
"yes? It's the only life I know. I can't speak for
him, but that would put me at ease. But I also

1047
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:21,529
"don't understand all this--" He glances over at
Taryon's dragonhide armor and the giant metallic

1048
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:27,618
man behind him with glowing runes on his body
that's writing this all down, and goes, "You know.

1049
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:31,421
"Them. Arcane stuff."

1050
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:42,014
ASHLEY: It's, you know, to each his own.

1051
01:11:42,014 --> 01:11:45,997
(laughter)

1052
01:11:45,997 --> 01:11:49,495
MATT: "Tea?"

1053
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:52,746
LAURA: Sure.

1054
01:11:52,746 --> 01:11:58,243
MATT: All right. You guys stay for a bit and have
some tea with him and catch up, and let him know

1055
01:11:58,243 --> 01:12:05,326
more of the adventures that you've had since last
you checked up on him in Westruun. Anything else

1056
01:12:05,326 --> 01:12:08,776
you guys want to work out here in Westruun with
Wilhand?

1057
01:12:08,776 --> 01:12:13,754
SAM: I'll just ask him, is there any message you
wish to send to Ogden or the rest of the

1058
01:12:13,754 --> 01:12:15,762
Trickfoots?

1059
01:12:15,762 --> 01:12:27,122
MATT: "I would tell them that if they have a
penchant for sweets, they should curb that a bit.

1060
01:12:27,122 --> 01:12:29,723
"Apparently there's a family history of diabetes."

1061
01:12:29,723 --> 01:12:32,780
(laughter)

1062
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:33,684
SAM: All right.

1063
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:36,514
MATT: "Just a word of advice I'm throwing out
there for their own well-being."

1064
01:12:36,514 --> 01:12:38,502
SAM: Okay. Family history, got it.

1065
01:12:38,502 --> 01:12:43,170
MATT: "Yeah."

1066
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,322
SAM: All right.

1067
01:12:44,322 --> 01:12:48,607
MATT: "And don't be penises."

1068
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:51,444
SAM: Very good.

1069
01:12:51,444 --> 01:12:53,429
MARISHA: Wise words.

1070
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:56,745
MATT: "See? Told you." (laughs)

1071
01:12:56,745 --> 01:13:06,279
LAURA: Wilhand? Should you remember anything about
this curse that we've asked you about, please send

1072
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:09,795
word? We want to protect Pike as much as we can.

1073
01:13:09,795 --> 01:13:14,440
MATT: "I understand. I'll look into some books. If
I hear anything, I'll send word."

1074
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,465
LAURA: Thank you.

1075
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:16,470
MATT: "Of course."

1076
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,615
ASHLEY: I'm sure it's nothing, but in case you
remember anything.

1077
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,430
MATT: "I will be happy to do so."

1078
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:30,083
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll just take the rest of it. I'll
probably have it on the way home.

1079
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,650
MATT: "Are you sure? I don't mind, it was
delicious."

1080
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:33,836
ASHLEY: No, no.

1081
01:13:33,836 --> 01:13:37,005
LAURA: We'll send some your way that are fresh, I
swear they're very good.

1082
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:38,514
ASHLEY: They're very good, I promise.

1083
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,051
MATT: "All right."

1084
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:48,311
SAM: In Gnome, I say, it has been lovely making
your acquaint-anus.

1085
01:13:48,311 --> 01:13:54,897
(laughter)

1086
01:13:54,897 --> 01:14:01,235
MATT: He responds with, "And you're getting
better, but perhaps some practice, in time."

1087
01:14:01,235 --> 01:14:05,004
SAM: I'll keep working on it.

1088
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:08,953
MATT: "Until then, avoid anyone of any sort of
gnomish nobility for a while. That's my

1089
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:11,377
"recommendation," he says to you in Gnome.

1090
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:14,010
ASHLEY: We're working on it.

1091
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:17,896
(laughter)

1092
01:14:17,896 --> 01:14:22,612
MARISHA: Pike, is there anything you need from
here before we leave?

1093
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:27,927
ASHLEY: I don't think so. Real quick.

1094
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:29,365
MATT: "Yes?"

1095
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:36,365
ASHLEY: I get up and I stand behind him and comb
his hair out.

1096
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:44,375
MATT: "It's been a while since somebody's done
that for me. Thank you."

1097
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:52,968
ASHLEY: It looks so great, just all natural, out,
ready for the world, but I wanted to make you just

1098
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:54,957
look a little bit more coiffed.

1099
01:14:54,957 --> 01:15:06,811
MATT: "Thank you. It's a bit unbridled, I would
like perhaps to... the word escapes me." And he

1100
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:15,966
takes another sip of his tea, thinks for a second,
goes, "I wish to be less crazy-looking."

1101
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:25,030
ASHLEY: Well, can I just say, I think you look
perfect.

1102
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:33,221
MATT: And he reaches up and pinches the edge of
your cheek and goes, "Well, can I just say that I

1103
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:38,120
"never thought blue would be your color, but it
looks fantastic."

1104
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:44,697
ASHLEY: It hasn't washed out yet, but it's fun for
a little bit, just to try something.

1105
01:15:44,697 --> 01:15:57,547
MATT: "Just to try something. Ah, I remember those
days. Anyway. Don't be a stranger."

1106
01:15:57,547 --> 01:15:59,675
ASHLEY: Okay. It was wonderful to see you.

1107
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:02,605
MATT: "Wonderful to see you as well. And please,
do send me some fresher treats."

1108
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:03,649
LAURA: I will.

1109
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:04,375
MATT: "Thank you."

1110
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,603
LAURA: Thank you for your hospitality.

1111
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,262
MATT: "Of course. Thank you for coming. And a
pleasure to meet you, uh--"

1112
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:10,806
SAM: Taryon Darrington.

1113
01:16:10,806 --> 01:16:13,885
MATT: "Taryon Darrington. Pleasure to meet you,
yes."

1114
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:16,469
SAM: Not a firm handshake at all.

1115
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:20,115
ASHLEY: Okay.

1116
01:16:20,115 --> 01:16:22,230
MATT: All right, you guys make your way back to
Whitestone?

1117
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:22,968
ASHLEY: What's that?

1118
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:24,008
MATT: You guys make your way back to Whitestone?

1119
01:16:24,008 --> 01:16:25,158
LAURA: I guess so, yeah.

1120
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:26,113
ASHLEY: Shoot.

1121
01:16:26,113 --> 01:16:28,117
MATT: You guys return.

1122
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:31,911
ASHLEY: Finish the rest of the blondie through the
fshoom.

1123
01:16:31,911 --> 01:16:33,791
MATT: Just (chomps) as you step through.

1124
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,904
TALIESIN: Stale blondie.

1125
01:16:35,904 --> 01:16:37,048
MARISHA: Stale blondie.

1126
01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:46,287
MATT: As you guys return, stepping back into the
main thoroughfare of Whitestone, you gather, over

1127
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:52,063
this time, the rest of your friends have done a
relatively decent-- they're like three quarters of

1128
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:54,847
the way through their tour of Whitestone. It's
very basic, they're not going through every single

1129
01:16:54,847 --> 01:17:00,564
detail, but they're going in various sections, and
Ogden has been asleep pretty much the entire time.

1130
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:09,923
JB, Johann, and Astra have been eager, for the
most part, asking questions, and some of the time,

1131
01:17:09,923 --> 01:17:16,298
when you're not looking, kind of flicking the back
of the hat. But you've come around now, you're

1132
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:23,516
heading back up north after coming from the
graveyard, and both the Pelor church and the Raven

1133
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:26,819
Queen shrine that have been built there, and
you've made your way back northward into the city

1134
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:27,679
proper.

1135
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:33,663
LIAM: We said we were gonna do Firecracker Alley.
See the Musketeers. Can we do that? I really want

1136
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:34,562
to do that.

1137
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:35,890
TALIESIN: I'm not allowed to say that word out
loud.

1138
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,208
LIAM: Well, I'll hush up around your sister, but
it's just us right now.

1139
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:43,008
TRAVIS: Yeah, either that or it's like a pub crawl
through Whitestone, one or the other.

1140
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:45,796
TALIESIN: I think they may be drunk enough. Let's
go see the--

1141
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:52,178
MATT: Okay. Is there any specific individual that
you've set as the captain of the Riflemen of

1142
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,384
Whitestone?

1143
01:17:53,384 --> 01:17:54,954
TALIESIN: Your boy. What's his name?

1144
01:17:54,954 --> 01:17:55,859
LIAM: Kynan.

1145
01:17:55,859 --> 01:17:56,595
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1146
01:17:56,595 --> 01:17:58,734
MARISHA: (gasps) What?

1147
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:03,822
MATT: All right, so. As you guys approach, making
your way towards the northern barracks of the

1148
01:18:03,822 --> 01:18:12,508
city, you hear a cluster of small, controlled
explosions, at which point the gnomes all kind of

1149
01:18:12,508 --> 01:18:18,656
shudder for a second. In that moment, Ogden goes,
(incoherent yelling) "We're under attack!"

1150
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:25,156
TRAVIS: It's all right, it's all right, it's all
part of the tour. No, it's all right. Oh man. It's

1151
01:18:25,156 --> 01:18:27,778
okay. This is Firecracker Alley.

1152
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:29,588
MATT: "Okay."

1153
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:30,452
TRAVIS: All right.

1154
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:31,640
MATT: "All right."

1155
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,883
TRAVIS: These my people.

1156
01:18:32,883 --> 01:18:38,582
MATT: JB wipes the drool from his mouth. As you
guys approach, you see there's a line of ten men

1157
01:18:38,582 --> 01:18:43,311
and women in armor with rifles; they're currently
in the process of reloading them, and there you

1158
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:52,343
see at the edge is a leather-clad Kynan, who is in
the process of instructing loudly the reloading

1159
01:18:52,343 --> 01:18:56,901
process, the use of black powder, and the
preparation for the rifles for a secondary shot.

1160
01:18:56,901 --> 01:19:02,413
As they all prepare, he goes, "All right. And
aim!" Arm up in the air. They all (clatter) up in

1161
01:19:02,413 --> 01:19:08,938
front. "Fire!" (gunshot) They all go off again,
these big plumes of smoke shoot out from the

1162
01:19:08,938 --> 01:19:15,735
front. You watch as across the way there are a
dozen or so hay targets with what looks like cloth

1163
01:19:15,735 --> 01:19:20,851
and some figures drawn on them that have a number
of holes blown through them in multiple places.

1164
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:24,373
The shots don't have extremely good aim.

1165
01:19:24,373 --> 01:19:26,753
LIAM: How many rifles are we looking at, here?

1166
01:19:26,753 --> 01:19:29,849
MATT: You're looking at ten different people with
rifles.

1167
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:32,209
LIAM: Queen's Grace, that's a lot of guns, Percy.

1168
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:38,492
MATT: As you guys approach, gently, as they're
preparing for the next shot, you see Kynan bring

1169
01:19:38,492 --> 01:19:42,097
up his arm and look over and see the rest of you,
and immediately changes his posture. He was

1170
01:19:42,097 --> 01:19:47,718
already in a formal leader position, but as soon
as you approach, it's almost like, oh, the boss is

1171
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:53,176
here to watch. And he kind of (inhales). "Hold. We
have company."

1172
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:54,607
TALIESIN: At ease, at ease.

1173
01:19:54,607 --> 01:20:00,694
MATT: Turns around and jogs up to the edge of the
perimeter of this training ground. And he goes,

1174
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:04,975
"Hello. By what pleasure do we have you--?"

1175
01:20:04,975 --> 01:20:10,388
TALIESIN: We are giving a very rare tour of the
grounds and we thought that, these being

1176
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:14,722
Trickfoots, as in the family of Trickfoots--

1177
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,206
MATT: "Oh. Oh!"

1178
01:20:16,206 --> 01:20:21,676
TALIESIN: -- we would show them one of the things
that makes this castle so special, and one of the

1179
01:20:21,676 --> 01:20:24,379
things that makes this castle so special is you
and your company.

1180
01:20:24,379 --> 01:20:36,505
MATT: "Well, it is an honor to have the Trickfoots
among us. I am Captain Kynan Leore. I am the, as

1181
01:20:36,505 --> 01:20:43,636
"to recently assigned, captain of the Riflemen of
Whitestone." And you see him go from-- his whole,

1182
01:20:43,636 --> 01:20:49,334
structured presentation begins to quickly fade as
the nerves kick in. You can see his voice get a

1183
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:58,883
little quivery and his posture begin to fall a
little bit. "These are my Riflemen... and women! It's

1184
01:20:58,883 --> 01:21:04,397
"called Riflemen, but it's men and women. It's a
formality."

1185
01:21:04,397 --> 01:21:05,603
LIAM: Kynan--

1186
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:07,422
MATT: "It can be changed, it can be changed."

1187
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:08,525
LIAM: Hey.

1188
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:09,984
LAURA: Riflepeople.

1189
01:21:09,984 --> 01:21:12,546
LIAM: Hey, it's been months. You're looking on
point.

1190
01:21:12,546 --> 01:21:22,551
MATT: "Well, we're trying. They're very, very good
people. Aren't they? Yes?" And they all don't know

1191
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:25,706
how to answer and look at each other and look at
him and--

1192
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:34,270
TALIESIN: At ease. This man in command of you all
is one of the few people who could actually do a

1193
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:37,086
little damage to us in our time. He has great
respect.

1194
01:21:37,086 --> 01:21:38,305
LIAM: Yeah.

1195
01:21:38,305 --> 01:21:43,713
MATT: He puts his eyes down, slightly sheepishly
and guiltily as you say that, but--

1196
01:21:43,713 --> 01:21:47,184
LIAM: That's old history. How are you getting on?

1197
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:59,998
MATT: "Very well. Very well. I mean, very few get
a second chance.

1198
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:03,255
"I just don't want to mess this up."

1199
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:05,502
LIAM: Are you being of use?

1200
01:22:05,502 --> 01:22:08,466
MATT: Looks to Percival.

1201
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:13,980
TALIESIN: Very much so. I could not think of
anyone better for this particular occupation. I am

1202
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,414
nothing but prideful.

1203
01:22:15,414 --> 01:22:17,218
LIAM: Well, that's enough.

1204
01:22:17,218 --> 01:22:22,011
MATT: "Then yes, I have been of use."

1205
01:22:22,011 --> 01:22:25,297
LIAM: (whispers) How's Simon?

1206
01:22:25,297 --> 01:22:36,109
MATT: "Oh!" He looks over at the rest of the folk
and goes, "At ease! Go get some food." The men

1207
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:37,726
break and make their way walking out--

1208
01:22:37,726 --> 01:22:41,578
LAURA: And women. Because there's men and women.

1209
01:22:41,578 --> 01:22:45,352
LIAM: Sometimes I sound like my sister. I'm sorry.
I just like equality for all.

1210
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:53,440
MATT: But he leans in and says, "Simon is doing
well." And he pulls up the front of his armor a

1211
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,918
little bit and you can see the snake belt itself
is still on him.

1212
01:22:55,918 --> 01:22:59,048
LIAM: (whispers) Can I say hello?

1213
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:08,399
MATT: "I mean--" Glances over at the men not
watching-- and women.

1214
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:11,075
TALIESIN: I'm showing off some trick shots to the
Trickfoots while we're--

1215
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:14,491
MATT: Okay, so as you're doing a whole Buffalo
Bill--

1216
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:19,168
(laughter)

1217
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:25,916
MATT: I should say, Wild Bill. Buffalo Bill is a
whole different thing. Buffalo Bill's a very

1218
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:26,897
different thing.

1219
01:23:26,897 --> 01:23:29,505
(laughter)

1220
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,590
MATT: I need to specify.

1221
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:33,459
TALIESIN: That's a very different show.

1222
01:23:33,459 --> 01:23:40,931
MATT: Yeah, no. It's a whole different pit in
Whitestone to go to. He goes ahead and does a

1223
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:45,897
little whistle, and suddenly the belt turns into a
snake and winds its way up the forearm and

1224
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:46,898
(hisses).

1225
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:51,104
LIAM: Oh, fuck! Buddy! Can I hold him for a
minute?

1226
01:23:51,104 --> 01:23:52,956
MATT: "Yeah! Well, he's still yours."

1227
01:23:52,956 --> 01:23:54,245
LIAM: Ah.

1228
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:56,918
MATT: The snake leaps to your arm and coils
around.

1229
01:23:56,933 --> 01:24:00,974
LIAM: Hey! Hey! You are bigger. What is he
feeding you? What are you feeding him?

1230
01:24:01,096 --> 01:24:02,968
LAURA: "Belt!"

1231
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:05,437
MATT: "Well, nothing. It's a--"

1232
01:24:05,437 --> 01:24:09,503
LIAM: Well, I fed him. I mean, you don't have to,
I guess.

1233
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:15,543
MATT: "I can! I can feed him. I just didn't
think-- It's a belt! I don't know--

1234
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:17,949
"I'll feed him."

1235
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:23,092
LIAM: When was the last time this belt was a
snake, before now?

1236
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:34,701
MATT: "When you give it to me. I haven't had to
use it! And then should I let it out? I don't

1237
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:37,244
"know. I don't know how these things work, okay?"

1238
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:40,581
MARISHA: Not everyone can be a dope adventurer,
all right?

1239
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:46,866
LIAM: I'm conflicted here. I did give this to
you--

1240
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:51,979
MATT: "Right. You gave me a belt. And I've used
it, and it's been great."

1241
01:24:51,979 --> 01:24:54,904
LIAM: Can I insight check Simon to see how he's
feeling?

1242
01:24:54,904 --> 01:24:58,567
MATT: Sure! With your extensive knowledge of
magical snake belts,

1243
01:24:58,567 --> 01:25:00,293
let's see how well this goes.

1244
01:25:00,368 --> 01:25:01,852
LIAM: Hey, this is all bullshit, man.

1245
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:03,282
MATT: I know. I love it!

1246
01:25:03,282 --> 01:25:04,840
LIAM: That's insight?

1247
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,831
MATT: Yeah.

1248
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:09,873
LIAM: No, I'm gonna use wisdom. Excuse me, I'm
going to use Luck. Oh, that's much better.

1249
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:11,049
TRAVIS: Luck.

1250
01:25:11,049 --> 01:25:12,621
MATT: Blow that Luck, baby!

1251
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:14,521
LIAM: That's 18.

1252
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:21,365
MATT: 18. Yeah. He seems fine. As a magical snake,
it can transform back and forth. It doesn't appear

1253
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:26,090
to require food or water when it's in its belt
form. It wouldn't necessarily be conscious of the

1254
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:29,633
time in between. So as far as Simon's concerned,
it's been a very short period of time.

1255
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:30,919
LIAM: Kynan.

1256
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:33,389
MATT: "Yes, Vax?"

1257
01:25:33,389 --> 01:25:35,520
LIAM: You are happy here-- happier here?

1258
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,215
MATT: "Very."

1259
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:52,256
LIAM: I'm very glad for that. You seem happy. And
everybody deserves a second chance. And I guess

1260
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:56,619
what I'm asking is: can I have my snake back?

1261
01:25:56,619 --> 01:26:01,993
MATT: "Of course. Yes! Here, I mean he was-- I was
just borrowing it for a while."

1262
01:26:01,993 --> 01:26:10,932
LIAM: Okay. I feel silly. I mean, I gave it to you
a year ago or so, but, I don't know, I missed him.

1263
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:12,324
I think I missed him.

1264
01:26:12,324 --> 01:26:13,567
MATT: "Okay. Yeah."

1265
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:19,163
TALIESIN: I'm so glad I can't hear any of this.

1266
01:26:19,163 --> 01:26:25,100
MATT: As he looks over at Percy doing all these
trick shots in the air and throwing things up and,

1267
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,696
like, showing the spinning. And the gnomes are
like, "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!"

1268
01:26:28,696 --> 01:26:34,807
TRAVIS: As you can see, Firecracker Alley was
constructed after the revolt of the Haybales of

1269
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:37,103
1874... 39.

1270
01:26:37,103 --> 01:26:42,318
LIAM: I let Simon crawl down and form a belt.

1271
01:26:42,318 --> 01:26:43,362
MATT: Okay.

1272
01:26:43,362 --> 01:26:48,657
LIAM: And I give Kynan just a gentle little clap
on the cheek and say, I'm glad you're fitting in.

1273
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:57,028
MATT: "Me too. And thank you. Sorry about not
feeding your snake. I didn't--"

1274
01:26:57,028 --> 01:26:59,329
(laughter)

1275
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:04,785
LIAM: I think you're well on your way to being
that hero you dreamed of when you were younger.

1276
01:27:04,785 --> 01:27:10,482
MATT: "Well, thank you, I was-- " (gun noise) And
his rifle goes off like in the ground

1277
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:11,601
next to him.

1278
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,120
LAURA: Oh my god.

1279
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,503
MATT: A big plume of dirt next to him, and he
goes, "Uh--"

1280
01:27:16,503 --> 01:27:22,485
LIAM: Happens to the best of us. You got all your
toes?

1281
01:27:22,485 --> 01:27:26,450
MATT: "Men!" And he goes running off toward the
rest of his Riflemen.

1282
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:31,412
Yeah, you shook him a little bit.

1283
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:32,866
LIAM: All right.

1284
01:27:32,866 --> 01:27:42,651
TRAVIS: So how do you feel your tour has gone so
far? Are you feeling educated, enthused?

1285
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:50,226
MATT: "All of that! All of it, honestly." Johann
at this point is still enthralled and goes, "Where

1286
01:27:50,226 --> 01:27:52,910
"does one procure such a weapon?"

1287
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,649
TALIESIN: One does not, sadly.

1288
01:27:54,649 --> 01:27:56,891
MATT: "Okay."

1289
01:27:56,891 --> 01:28:01,577
TALIESIN: They're very rare outside of this
castle, and traditionally when they're found

1290
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:05,533
outside of this castle, they're collected and the
owner is often killed.

1291
01:28:05,533 --> 01:28:16,675
MATT: "Good to know! Good to know, Astra." And
Astra goes, "What?! I think it's sexy." And

1292
01:28:16,675 --> 01:28:20,654
Johann's like, "If you have one lying around you
don't need, just let me-- "

1293
01:28:20,654 --> 01:28:21,715
TALIESIN: I will let you know.

1294
01:28:21,715 --> 01:28:22,617
MATT: "Okay."

1295
01:28:22,617 --> 01:28:27,440
TRAVIS: Hey Percy, I feel like we should end with,
like, a big bang. Like, you know, like, the goods

1296
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,893
of Whitestone.

1297
01:28:28,893 --> 01:28:31,480
SAM: The old apple-in-the-hand?

1298
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:38,708
LIAM: (whispers) Do you think Grog and I could
shoot a gun?

1299
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:42,306
TALIESIN: Yes, I think that's a great idea.

1300
01:28:42,306 --> 01:28:45,095
LIAM: Yeah? Grog, we're gonna shoot guns!

1301
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:45,960
TRAVIS: Really?

1302
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,829
LIAM: Yeah!

1303
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:48,013
LIAM: He just said, he gave permission!

1304
01:28:48,013 --> 01:28:53,007
TALIESIN: I will say yes to this. Not one of my
guns, but thankfully we have a couple of the ones

1305
01:28:53,007 --> 01:28:54,416
that are a little wonky.

1306
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,424
MATT: The standard rifles. You do have those,
yeah.

1307
01:28:56,424 --> 01:28:59,484
LIAM: But I, like, I don't know. I throw things.
Can you show me how it works?

1308
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:00,736
TALIESIN: Kind of, yes.

1309
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:01,642
LIAM: All right.

1310
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,886
TALIESIN: It'll be fun.

1311
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:04,326
LIAM: (shouts) Gun, please!

1312
01:29:04,326 --> 01:29:10,158
MATT: Eventually you guys are outfitted with two
rifles. They're not loaded yet. You can show them

1313
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:11,314
how to load it.

1314
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:17,312
TALIESIN: I'm showing them through the basics of
loading the powder. I do this very quickly, so I

1315
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,569
know it's very difficult to see.

1316
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:19,582
LIAM: You're fast.

1317
01:29:19,582 --> 01:29:21,786
TALIESIN: Very fast, yes. I load it for them.

1318
01:29:21,786 --> 01:29:24,168
MATT: All right. You load it for each of them?

1319
01:29:24,168 --> 01:29:25,465
TALIESIN: One at a time.

1320
01:29:25,465 --> 01:29:26,302
MATT: Okay.

1321
01:29:26,302 --> 01:29:27,657
TALIESIN: Because this could go poorly.

1322
01:29:27,657 --> 01:29:28,820
TRAVIS: We're not loading it ourselves?

1323
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:30,511
TALIESIN: You're welcome to try.

1324
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:33,372
TRAVIS: I am a self-made man. I would like to
try.

1325
01:29:33,372 --> 01:29:35,388
LIAM: I will let Percy load my gun.

1326
01:29:35,388 --> 01:29:39,156
MATT: Okay, so Percy loads your gun. Grog, make an
intelligence check.

1327
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:42,372
TALIESIN: I give him an ample amount of powder.

1328
01:29:42,372 --> 01:29:45,386
TRAVIS: That's gonna be negative something--

1329
01:29:45,386 --> 01:29:47,178
(laughter)

1330
01:29:47,178 --> 01:29:48,309
TRAVIS: 12!

1331
01:29:48,309 --> 01:29:56,717
MATT: Okay. All right. You give him an ample
amount of powder, and he uses it. He uses it the

1332
01:29:56,717 --> 01:30:02,294
right way. It's a lot of it. But I mean, overall,
he got the gist of it, and he's-- (laughs)

1333
01:30:02,294 --> 01:30:04,001
TALIESIN: This is going to be funny.

1334
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:12,647
MATT: Yeah. Both rifles locked in. The iron balls
properly packed into the rifle. You both take aim.

1335
01:30:12,738 --> 01:30:18,845
I would like you both to roll an attack roll using
your dexterity modifier. You're not proficient, so

1336
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:23,312
it's just a d20 plus your dexterity modifier.
Grog, you have disadvantage on this one.

1337
01:30:23,312 --> 01:30:26,486
TRAVIS: Not going to need it.

1338
01:30:26,486 --> 01:30:28,919
LIAM: Plus dex modifier?

1339
01:30:28,919 --> 01:30:30,845
TRAVIS: Seven.

1340
01:30:30,845 --> 01:30:32,355
MATT: What did you roll?

1341
01:30:32,355 --> 01:30:34,135
TRAVIS: Five plus two.

1342
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:36,056
MATT: Okay, so it wasn't a misfire, at the very
least.

1343
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:37,310
LIAM: 17.

1344
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:47,111
MATT: Okay. You pull it up, Vax, aim and
(gunshot). You watch as the top of one of the hay

1345
01:30:47,111 --> 01:30:51,777
targets explodes off. You managed to make a hit.
It's a little off, but you managed to at least

1346
01:30:51,777 --> 01:30:52,787
make contact.

1347
01:30:52,787 --> 01:30:54,104
TALIESIN: Very solid.

1348
01:30:54,104 --> 01:30:55,726
LAURA: Did his feet come off the ground?

1349
01:30:55,726 --> 01:30:58,226
MATT: No, but it does come up and you
have to catch yourself.

1350
01:30:58,297 --> 01:31:01,418
TALIESIN: There's a bit of kick to these. You feel
it in the shoulder.

1351
01:31:01,418 --> 01:31:02,654
LAURA: So there.

1352
01:31:02,654 --> 01:31:08,476
MATT: Grog does not move at all when it fires.
(explosion noise) When you do fire, nothing

1353
01:31:08,476 --> 01:31:18,451
reacts. None of the hay reacts, and there's a
pause, and about 300 feet back, you watch as a

1354
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:22,736
small tree goes (cracking, heavy impact).

1355
01:31:22,736 --> 01:31:25,268
TRAVIS: Was that the Sun Tree?

1356
01:31:25,268 --> 01:31:29,658
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1357
01:31:29,658 --> 01:31:31,521
TRAVIS: I'm so sorry.

1358
01:31:31,521 --> 01:31:32,702
TALIESIN: It's all right.

1359
01:31:32,702 --> 01:31:34,909
TRAVIS: I could go stick it up and cover it with
tape and stuff.

1360
01:31:34,909 --> 01:31:36,079
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

1361
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,749
TRAVIS: Okay. I take off running.

1362
01:31:37,749 --> 01:31:41,095
(laughter)

1363
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:49,725
LIAM: Vax, who was really giddy a minute ago,
takes the rifle and hands it to you.

1364
01:31:49,725 --> 01:31:52,817
These are dangerous.

1365
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:54,019
TALIESIN: Extremely.

1366
01:31:54,019 --> 01:31:58,574
LIAM: There shouldn't be too many of these.

1367
01:31:58,574 --> 01:32:06,337
TALIESIN: There should not, which is why if we
find them outside this castle, it's taken care of,

1368
01:32:06,337 --> 01:32:08,337
one way or another.

1369
01:32:08,337 --> 01:32:09,818
LIAM: Fuck.

1370
01:32:09,818 --> 01:32:17,049
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a quick load shot just
to air it out a bit.

1371
01:32:17,049 --> 01:32:28,410
MATT: Okay. You do, and it's a really rapid
reload. We're talking Schwarzenegger T-2. Spin the

1372
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,404
shotgun one-handed. (gunshot)

1373
01:32:30,404 --> 01:32:33,165
TRAVIS: I'm a hundred yards away. Shouldn't he
have to roll to see if he shoots me?

1374
01:32:33,165 --> 01:32:34,577
MATT: Are you shooting at Grog?

1375
01:32:34,577 --> 01:32:35,616
TALIESIN: No.

1376
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,095
(laughter)

1377
01:32:37,095 --> 01:32:39,541
TALIESIN: The rifle doesn't have a super long
range, either. It's more of a stopping power

1378
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:40,449
weapon.

1379
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:42,985
MATT: Go ahead and roll, with proficiency and your
dex modiifer.

1380
01:32:42,985 --> 01:32:46,294
LIAM: You don't shoot with your gun, you shoot
with your heart.

1381
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,765
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is 25.

1382
01:32:48,765 --> 01:32:54,999
MATT: The same target, Vax, the impact of the head
you hit, you watch as the entire upper part of its

1383
01:32:54,999 --> 01:33:00,530
torso and head (explosion noise) explode into a
spray of slightly seared and

1384
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:02,152
slightly burning hay.

1385
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:13,750
TALIESIN: I will never, ever outlive the shame I
feel for inventing these. I put it back down. Walk

1386
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,772
away.

1387
01:33:14,772 --> 01:33:19,009
TRAVIS: From 300 yards away, I yell, (muffled) it
is not the Sun Tree!

1388
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:21,416
(laughter)

1389
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:26,309
MATT: As he runs back, you can see as Johann's
like,

1390
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:29,825
"Is there any chance that we could shoot one?"

1391
01:33:29,825 --> 01:33:40,682
TALIESIN: You know what? I'm going to say yes.

1392
01:33:40,682 --> 01:33:41,722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1393
01:33:41,722 --> 01:33:44,498
MATT: You see Astra's (squeals).

1394
01:33:44,498 --> 01:33:46,052
TALIESIN: One at a time.

1395
01:33:46,052 --> 01:33:49,339
MATT: They both look at each other and they both
jump off the carpet.

1396
01:33:49,339 --> 01:33:51,553
TALIESIN: You'll have to be very careful. It's
very dangerous.

1397
01:33:51,553 --> 01:33:53,042
Not just for what you're shooting at--

1398
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:55,009
MATT: They're not even listening. They're both
picking up the two rifles.

1399
01:33:55,009 --> 01:33:56,263
TALIESIN: They're both empty.

1400
01:33:56,263 --> 01:34:01,145
MATT: They pick them up and are looking at it and
holding it upward and aiming it sideways. They

1401
01:34:01,145 --> 01:34:02,393
don't really know how to do it.

1402
01:34:02,393 --> 01:34:03,778
TALIESIN: I'm going to go a little Luciferian
here.

1403
01:34:03,778 --> 01:34:05,341
LIAM: I'm back in security guard mode.

1404
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,341
MATT: Do you help them load it?

1405
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:12,689
TALIESIN: I'm going to load one at a time. I'm
going to mis-load; I'm going to let the powder

1406
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:18,939
roll so it creates a flashpan. It's going to be
a big, ugly, loud mess. It's not going to fire a

1407
01:34:19,014 --> 01:34:21,444
shot. It's just going to be a big, ugly mess.

1408
01:34:21,444 --> 01:34:22,752
MARISHA: You're making a blank?

1409
01:34:22,752 --> 01:34:28,299
TALIESIN: I'm making a blank. I'm making a blank
with a powder pop. It's going to be a little

1410
01:34:28,299 --> 01:34:29,426
singe-y.

1411
01:34:29,426 --> 01:34:37,904
MATT: All right, so for the purposes of this...
okay. No terrible misfire. The first shot is

1412
01:34:37,904 --> 01:34:46,841
Johann because he pushes Astra back and is like,
"Let the men do this first." Takes the rifle from

1413
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:53,323
you. Picks it up and aims it at a weird angle.
"And I just pull right here on the thing? Right

1414
01:34:53,323 --> 01:35:01,392
"over here?" (explosion) Before he finishes, it
goes off. It goes flying from his hand, and he

1415
01:35:01,392 --> 01:35:05,019
stands there for a second with his hands open, and
as he turns back towards you, you can see there's

1416
01:35:05,019 --> 01:35:11,129
a little bit of singe on his eyebrows. The burst
of the smoke and the flash seared the front of his

1417
01:35:11,129 --> 01:35:16,814
face ever so slightly. He turns to you and goes,
"That was amazing. Did I hit it?"

1418
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:19,232
TALIESIN: You hit something. Well done.

1419
01:35:19,232 --> 01:35:25,922
MATT: "I hit it! You're up, lady." Astra's like,
"Oh!" and she runs up. Takes the gun. Same thing?

1420
01:35:25,922 --> 01:35:30,958
TALIESIN: You know, just because I'm curious, I'm
going to give her a normal shot.

1421
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:44,266
MATT: Okay, so you load it properly. She takes it
and aims at one of the other targets. (gunshot)

1422
01:35:44,266 --> 01:35:48,141
She manages to hold onto it; this one doesn't
blast out of her hand. You don't see any point of

1423
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:49,197
impact.

1424
01:35:49,197 --> 01:35:50,579
TALIESIN: Good form.

1425
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:56,210
MATT: She's like, "Ow!" and she releases her hand
because of the heat of the barrel.

1426
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:57,390
TALIESIN: That, as well.

1427
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:02,824
MATT: She puts it on the ground and goes, "That
was fun. I'm good."

1428
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:04,156
TALIESIN: I figured.

1429
01:36:04,156 --> 01:36:07,808
TRAVIS: (panting) I heard shots. What's the
problem?

1430
01:36:07,808 --> 01:36:12,472
MATT: Grog, you look down and notice that there's
a little bit of bleeding from your knee, and

1431
01:36:12,472 --> 01:36:16,139
there's a small bullet hole that you didn't notice
as you were running back.

1432
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:20,626
TALIESIN: The Sun Tree was angry. It may have
taken revenge.

1433
01:36:20,626 --> 01:36:23,578
TRAVIS: (whines, groans)

1434
01:36:23,578 --> 01:36:33,288
MATT: It only went in an inch. It wasn't that hard
of an impact.

1435
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:36,601
TRAVIS: Mine.

1436
01:36:36,601 --> 01:36:38,990
(laughter)

1437
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:43,441
MATT: Eventually, as you guys are heading back
now, after the rest of your tour, you meet up with

1438
01:36:43,441 --> 01:36:45,729
the rest of the party. As you guys finish the
tour--

1439
01:36:45,729 --> 01:36:50,643
LIAM: A minor thing. As we're walking back, I
sidle up next to Percy and I don't say anything. I

1440
01:36:50,643 --> 01:36:54,270
just do that friend thing where you just go-- and
I keep walking.

1441
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:56,315
MATT: Vax bumps you.

1442
01:36:56,315 --> 01:36:59,296
TRAVIS: Do we want to show them the sphere?

1443
01:36:59,296 --> 01:37:02,433
TALIESIN: No, I think that we've had enough for
the evening.

1444
01:37:02,433 --> 01:37:04,856
TRAVIS: Really? That's the craziest thing in this
town.

1445
01:37:04,856 --> 01:37:07,781
TALIESIN: No, I have to fill out so much paperwork
for that one. We'll do it next time.

1446
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:11,494
TRAVIS: Oh. You know, I do know how to write a few
letters now.

1447
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:13,689
TALIESIN: If you would like to try and fill out
the paperwork...

1448
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:15,964
TRAVIS: Well, let's not get carried away.

1449
01:37:15,964 --> 01:37:20,304
TALIESIN: All right, then. I certainly am not up
to it, so I completely understand if you're not.

1450
01:37:20,304 --> 01:37:21,477
TRAVIS: Fine.

1451
01:37:21,477 --> 01:37:25,388
MATT: All right. You guys catch up with the rest
of the party, and you all make your way to the

1452
01:37:25,388 --> 01:37:26,923
castle at about the same time.

1453
01:37:26,923 --> 01:37:32,133
TALIESIN: Just checking. None of the gnomes had
even the slightest tinge of reaction when he said

1454
01:37:32,133 --> 01:37:33,548
that? Or no.

1455
01:37:33,548 --> 01:37:36,434
MATT: Make a perception check.

1456
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:41,039
LIAM: Other than when I was shooting the gun, I've
been watching them like a hawk, as well.

1457
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:44,793
TALIESIN: 23.

1458
01:37:44,793 --> 01:37:46,701
MATT: Okay. Vax?

1459
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:47,772
LIAM: 29.

1460
01:37:47,772 --> 01:37:49,034
MATT: Okay.

1461
01:37:49,034 --> 01:37:50,465
TALIESIN: Even a twitch?

1462
01:37:50,465 --> 01:37:55,935
MATT: No reaction. No twitch. They have no idea
what you were talking about, and they have not

1463
01:37:55,935 --> 01:37:58,191
stolen anything. You've been keeping a close eye.

1464
01:37:58,191 --> 01:38:00,930
SAM: Except your heart.

1465
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:03,774
TRAVIS: Ain't that the truth.

1466
01:38:03,774 --> 01:38:12,741
MATT: As you guys all reconvene for a
mid-afternoon lunch at the castle, everyone's made

1467
01:38:12,741 --> 01:38:17,473
their way in. The meal's been placed. Less
pastry-heavy than the breakfast that Johann

1468
01:38:17,473 --> 01:38:21,753
originally ordered, but there are meats and
breads, and it's actually pretty hearty for a

1469
01:38:21,753 --> 01:38:28,616
midday lunch, and they keep bringing more in. You
get the sense that the Trickfoots don't eat like

1470
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:35,323
royals often, and they're definitely making the
best they can of the situation. You see JB eating

1471
01:38:35,323 --> 01:38:39,625
her meal and helping Ogden as you guys settle in.
What do you want to do?

1472
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:42,678
LAURA: What the fuck should we do?

1473
01:38:42,678 --> 01:38:48,832
TALIESIN: Perhaps it's time to have a difficult
conversation.

1474
01:38:48,832 --> 01:38:57,375
ASHLEY: I think so. I'd like to talk to Ogden
again.

1475
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:03,106
MATT: Okay. He's currently at the table, and he's
tracing his finger on the side, while

1476
01:39:03,106 --> 01:39:07,569
occasionally, JB goes, "Uncle?" and taps him.

1477
01:39:07,569 --> 01:39:13,803
"Oh. Right." She goes and takes a piece of bread
and soaks it in the soup for a second and puts it

1478
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:20,793
in his mouth. He chews on it for a bit, and as you
walk over, he pushes JB's hand out of the way and

1479
01:39:20,793 --> 01:39:24,827
goes, "Oh, young Pike. Hello."

1480
01:39:24,827 --> 01:39:30,373
ASHLEY: Hello. Did you have a good time today?

1481
01:39:30,373 --> 01:39:35,079
MATT: "I did. I haven't had a rest like that in a
long time."

1482
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:37,909
ASHLEY: Well, that's good.

1483
01:39:37,909 --> 01:39:40,153
MATT: "Your city gets very loud."

1484
01:39:40,153 --> 01:39:48,782
ASHLEY: It gets pretty loud here. It's true. I take
it you went to Firecracker Alley?

1485
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:49,972
MATT: "That's the one."

1486
01:39:49,972 --> 01:39:51,143
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's real loud.

1487
01:39:51,143 --> 01:39:59,517
MATT: JB peeks over Ogden's shoulder, listening
in. "It was quite nice, actually. We got to watch

1488
01:39:59,517 --> 01:40:01,223
"them fire these--"

1489
01:40:01,223 --> 01:40:06,495
"Anyway!" Ogden pushes in, not even paying
attention to her. "It's so good to see you."

1490
01:40:06,495 --> 01:40:09,732
ASHLEY: Will you take a walk with me?

1491
01:40:09,732 --> 01:40:16,239
MATT: "But of course." He takes his stick and
stands up.

1492
01:40:16,318 --> 01:40:20,518
JB's like, "Oh. Where would you like to go?"

1493
01:40:20,518 --> 01:40:34,979
ASHLEY: Well... I just would love to spend some
time with you alone, Uncle Ogden.

1494
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:38,288
MATT: JB, you watch her face go--

1495
01:40:38,288 --> 01:40:41,901
ASHLEY: I'll spend some time with you, as well,
JB. I just want to make sure I get time with

1496
01:40:41,901 --> 01:40:42,821
everybody.

1497
01:40:42,821 --> 01:40:51,229
MATT: "Of course. Enjoy. I'll just--" And she goes
back to her meal and begins cutting it up with

1498
01:40:51,229 --> 01:40:54,186
fervor or frustration.

1499
01:40:54,186 --> 01:41:03,202
LAURA: Can I take JB and ask her, did you happen
to see my home on the tour?

1500
01:41:03,202 --> 01:41:06,295
MATT: "I don't know where you live."

1501
01:41:06,295 --> 01:41:09,626
LAURA: Would you like to see? I'd love to show
you.

1502
01:41:09,626 --> 01:41:17,779
MATT: She sidelong glances at Pike helping Ogden
up as they begin to make their way out. "You know

1503
01:41:17,929 --> 01:41:19,775
"what? Yes. I would love that."

1504
01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:22,097
LAURA: All right. I take her.

1505
01:41:22,097 --> 01:41:27,868
MATT: So you guys begin making your way. While
they exit, because Ogden's a little slower, you

1506
01:41:27,868 --> 01:41:31,511
and Ogden eventually make your way out to the
front part of the castle, walking along the side

1507
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:39,022
grounds. He's with his cane, walking. "What did
you wish to discuss, young Pike?"

1508
01:41:39,022 --> 01:41:44,788
ASHLEY: I'm blanking right now. Is there a temple
of Sarenrae here?

1509
01:41:44,788 --> 01:41:52,864
MATT: You have definitely had one constructed.
It's a smaller scale. The larger temples here are

1510
01:41:52,864 --> 01:41:57,295
for Pelor and such and you've been away. Most of
your focus has been in Vasselheim and Emon, so you

1511
01:41:57,295 --> 01:42:01,332
haven't done the full temple construct here, but
there's a small shrine that you've built so at

1512
01:42:01,332 --> 01:42:02,848
least you can go there.

1513
01:42:02,848 --> 01:42:10,831
ASHLEY: I would love to walk you to something that
I was a part of building and creating here in the

1514
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:14,765
city, if you'd like.

1515
01:42:14,765 --> 01:42:21,608
MATT: "Of course. Lead the way. I am your guest. I
am here at your behest."

1516
01:42:21,608 --> 01:42:27,216
ASHLEY: I walk him to the shrine of Sarenrae.

1517
01:42:27,216 --> 01:42:34,012
MATT: Okay. There was a big building that
collapsed during the Briarwood period. The lot was

1518
01:42:34,012 --> 01:42:38,719
cleaned out, and it's a small standing shrine to
Sarenrae at the time being, to eventually be the

1519
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,702
placeholder for the full temple's construction
that you'll build around it. But for the time

1520
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:48,606
being, essentially a few small benches, set in a
circular stone fashion, and there's a fountain-like

1521
01:42:48,606 --> 01:42:55,402
carving. A simple carving of Sarenrae for people
to pray to. You eventually walk him to that

1522
01:42:55,402 --> 01:43:01,309
centerpiece. It's mostly empty this time of day.
Nobody's currently in the process of upkeep; there

1523
01:43:01,309 --> 01:43:06,505
isn't a need for it. Some fallen leaves, and it's
a little dirty on some of the benches, but you

1524
01:43:06,505 --> 01:43:14,164
brush it off and you both sit on the bench,
looking up at the big winged statue of her. He

1525
01:43:14,164 --> 01:43:15,103
sits down.

1526
01:43:15,103 --> 01:43:19,675
ASHLEY: Do you know where we are?

1527
01:43:19,675 --> 01:43:22,485
MATT: "No idea."

1528
01:43:22,485 --> 01:43:33,956
ASHLEY: This is a shrine of Sarenrae, who I
follow, and I wanted to bring you here because I

1529
01:43:33,956 --> 01:43:37,971
wanted to share it with you.

1530
01:43:37,971 --> 01:43:43,192
MATT: "Thank you. It's very peaceful."

1531
01:43:43,192 --> 01:43:51,933
ASHLEY: (sighs) How are you feeling?

1532
01:43:51,933 --> 01:44:14,169
MATT: After looking around for a minute, he leans
into you and goes, "Pike, we need to talk. I've

1533
01:44:14,169 --> 01:44:22,357
"been tying together the missing pieces of our
history for most of my life. This information has

1534
01:44:22,357 --> 01:44:36,843
"helped me once before, and as I'm sure has been
discussed at length with your friends, there is a

1535
01:44:36,843 --> 01:44:50,285
"curse upon this bloodline. My research has brought
me some knowledge, and I've been able to cast this

1536
01:44:50,285 --> 01:45:09,338
"curse out of one Trickfoot before, but I failed
once before that. And I miss her to this day. Do

1537
01:45:09,338 --> 01:45:13,199
"you want to know the history of our curse?"

1538
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,872
ASHLEY: I would.

1539
01:45:15,872 --> 01:45:26,069
MATT: "Over four centuries ago, when our kin still
occupied the city of Witterbach, up in the

1540
01:45:26,255 --> 01:45:34,757
"Cliffkeep Mountains, long before our bloodline
took the name Trickfoot, there was a wily rock

1541
01:45:34,757 --> 01:45:49,566
"gnome called OG Pipemender. Now, OG grew jealous
of his brother, Lons, and his business's success,

1542
01:45:49,566 --> 01:46:02,211
"and his marriage, apparently. So, seeking a means
of balancing their standing, bringing Lons down a

1543
01:46:02,266 --> 01:46:12,844
"peg or two, OG plotted to undermine and shame his
brother, and destroy his life. Now, he was

1544
01:46:12,844 --> 01:46:22,604
"successful in this plot, at least from what I've
gleaned. Lons was ruined, but not before it was

1545
01:46:22,604 --> 01:46:33,490
"revealed to Lons that OG himself was the culprit.
Now, cornered and fearing for his life, OG lashed

1546
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:45,543
"out and slew his brother. He fled Witterbach and
wandered the mountains for weeks, scavenging to

1547
01:46:45,543 --> 01:46:56,210
"survive. On a full moon, he was visited by a
vision of what is believed to be the Lawbearer,

1548
01:46:56,210 --> 01:47:07,931
"Erathis herself. At least, an aspect of her, at
the very least. Now, this grave injustice he had

1549
01:47:07,931 --> 01:47:17,459
"committed did not go unnoticed by the Lawbearer,
and it required punishment. And a curse was set

1550
01:47:17,459 --> 01:47:25,693
"within the very blood of OG himself. One that lay
dormant from generation to generation, unless

1551
01:47:25,693 --> 01:47:36,247
"those carrying the seed fell to extreme
selfishness and wanton destruction of others. Now,

1552
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:44,566
"we Trickfoots may not have the best reputation,
but what we do, we do it to survive. And we hurt

1553
01:47:44,566 --> 01:47:53,978
"no other in the process. Those that wander too far
into the dark call up this curse and the shades

1554
01:47:53,978 --> 01:48:07,735
"within them slowly hollow them out, leaving a
ravenous, selfish beast of a gnome. These visions

1555
01:48:07,735 --> 01:48:19,551
"that I've dreamt, I've had them before. They were
not wrong. I saw the shades within my beloved,

1556
01:48:19,551 --> 01:48:30,937
"Ishma, but knew too little at the time to stop
them. I caught the shades within others since.

1557
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:44,149
"Within Johann here, even, years and years ago. And
used what I learned to exorcise them out. Now,

1558
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:52,096
"these visions I have now show you, young Pike. A
darkness within you far greater than the others,

1559
01:48:52,096 --> 01:49:01,862
"and I don't know what has drawn them to you. You
walk with such light, and I am worried what could

1560
01:49:01,862 --> 01:49:15,981
"be hidden beneath all the layers of silver and
gold and blue and Sarenrae's blessing that could

1561
01:49:15,981 --> 01:49:28,687
"still draw these shades to you. Where you've been,
what you've done, I know not. I know not the

"justice of the goddess, can presume not to know, I
don't bother myself with such unknowable things.

1563
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:48,373
"But I am here to try and help, if I can. If you'll
have me."

1564
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:57,865
ASHLEY: Wow. That's a lot.

1565
01:49:57,865 --> 01:50:05,868
MATT: "I've had an entire lifetime to think and
learn and research and regret."

1566
01:50:05,868 --> 01:50:17,512
ASHLEY: How long have you been having visions, in
terms of this happening with me?

1567
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:23,372
MATT: "This is only over the past couple of years,
but I knew not where to find you until you sent

1568
01:50:23,372 --> 01:50:26,375
"your letter."

1569
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:40,193
ASHLEY: And what are your thoughts on JB?

1570
01:50:40,193 --> 01:50:51,620
MATT: "She is very dedicated. She's very sweet.
She's a bit distracted, at times. She cares much

1571
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:59,862
"for the stories of you and your friends. The poor
thing's been at my side for the majority of her

1572
01:50:59,862 --> 01:51:07,568
"youth. I feel like a burden. She looks after me
and not much else, so she lives vicariously

1573
01:51:07,568 --> 01:51:10,876
"through the stories she manages to assemble of
you."

1574
01:51:10,876 --> 01:51:17,555
ASHLEY: And she knows about all this, as well?

1575
01:51:17,555 --> 01:51:26,635
MATT: "They all know. We've had time to speak. I
was the one that insisted we come see you, and I

1576
01:51:26,635 --> 01:51:29,996
"do apologize for the rest of them. They are
unique."

1577
01:51:29,996 --> 01:51:47,522
ASHLEY: Well, I think I was at first shocked, and
I feel like I need to apologize for my trepidation

1578
01:51:47,522 --> 01:51:49,933
and wariness at first.

1579
01:51:49,933 --> 01:51:56,959
MATT: "It's understood. Like I said, we have a
reputation. One that you've, as far as what I've

1580
01:51:56,959 --> 01:52:04,966
"heard, been able to kick to the curb."

1581
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:07,542
LAURA: (sneezes)

1582
01:52:07,542 --> 01:52:09,765
ASHLEY: Bless you.

1583
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,500
LAURA: Thank you.

1584
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,530
ASHLEY: Just little fairies, sneezing fairies,
around here.

1585
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:17,678
MATT: "It's adorable. I don't see them."

1586
01:52:17,678 --> 01:52:20,383
ASHLEY: You usually don't. You just hear them.

1587
01:52:20,383 --> 01:52:24,174
MATT: "I don't see much, anyway."

1588
01:52:24,174 --> 01:52:36,150
ASHLEY: It's okay. You said you've had some
successes in releasing this thing?

1589
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:46,877
MATT: "I've cast it out once before. I've been
trying to define a ritual that can do so."

1590
01:52:46,877 --> 01:52:53,470
ASHLEY: How do you define this ritual? Is this
under any sort of faith that you have?

1591
01:52:53,470 --> 01:53:03,002
MATT: "I find little in faith. However, the
exorcism is based in divine magics and some bits

1592
01:53:03,002 --> 01:53:08,296
"of information I've gleaned from the Age of
Arcanum, long ago, back when possession was a

1593
01:53:08,296 --> 01:53:17,856
"common thing and gods still walked the earth. What
I've found--" And he leans forward on his stick.

1594
01:53:17,919 --> 01:53:27,514
"-- is to perform this. Pardon me, it's the
breakfast. All the oatmeal.

1595
01:53:27,696 --> 01:53:30,719
"It's good for the fiber."

1596
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,651
ASHLEY: It sure is.

1597
01:53:32,651 --> 01:53:39,146
MATT: "What I would require would be the highest
point on the highest mountain in the vicinity. As

1598
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:48,495
"high up as we can go. Like somewhere in those
mountains there." He points a broad stroke to the

1599
01:53:48,495 --> 01:53:56,813
north, northeast, to the Alabaster Sierras that
surround the Parchwood. "And when the moon is

1600
01:53:56,813 --> 01:54:07,655
"full, as that was when the original curse was cast
upon us, there, we hallow the ground to prepare.

1601
01:54:07,655 --> 01:54:17,134
"Perhaps you or another individual of a clerical
background could do so, and it does take some time

1602
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:27,334
"to hallow it. But with the ground hallowed, and
the moon is full, I can perform the exorcism. Now,

1603
01:54:27,334 --> 01:54:34,948
"should the shades be strong enough to survive the
exorcism, as they have once before, it will be up

1604
01:54:34,948 --> 01:54:42,272
"to you and your friends to slay them while they're
bound on that land. And if you cast them to the

1605
01:54:42,272 --> 01:54:48,873
"shadows where they came, the blood curse on you
would be no more."

1606
01:54:48,873 --> 01:54:51,294
ASHLEY: But they'll come back again?

1607
01:54:51,294 --> 01:54:55,978
MATT: "They are passed on through the bloodline."

1608
01:54:55,978 --> 01:55:00,996
ASHLEY: Is there any way to get rid of them
forever?

1609
01:55:00,996 --> 01:55:08,832
MATT: "From an individual, yes. Overall, I know
not. That involves silly, crazy god stuff, and,

1610
01:55:08,832 --> 01:55:18,661
"well, they haven't been around often. There are a
few things we need to prepare for the exorcism

1611
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:29,777
"that I don't have the access of. If you wish to go
through with this, let me know. If you find this

1612
01:55:29,777 --> 01:55:35,347
"all mumbo jumbo and you don't believe me, I don't
blame you, either, and we can be on our way.

1613
01:55:35,347 --> 01:55:37,405
"Choice is yours."

1614
01:55:37,405 --> 01:55:44,334
ASHLEY: So you want to perform the exorcism on
me?

1615
01:55:44,334 --> 01:55:48,147
MATT: "You're the one the visions brought me to."

1616
01:55:48,147 --> 01:55:54,715
ASHLEY: Well, this is something that I'll have to
think about. We'll have to talk about it with

1617
01:55:54,715 --> 01:55:59,670
everybody else, especially if it involves them, as
well.

1618
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:15,100
MATT: "Of course. Take your time. They're about--
JB? JB, how close are we to the full moon?" He's

1619
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:17,191
shouting out into nothing.

1620
01:56:17,191 --> 01:56:19,947
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check--

1621
01:56:19,947 --> 01:56:21,453
MATT: You're not there.

1622
01:56:21,453 --> 01:56:22,776
ASHLEY: Do I know?

1623
01:56:22,776 --> 01:56:24,456
MATT: Make a nature check.

1624
01:56:24,456 --> 01:56:25,695
ASHLEY: Nature check?

1625
01:56:25,695 --> 01:56:27,304
MATT: Nature check.

1626
01:56:27,304 --> 01:56:28,181
ASHLEY: Okay.

1627
01:56:28,262 --> 01:56:29,221
TRAVIS: Get it.

1628
01:56:29,221 --> 01:56:39,374
ASHLEY: Let me find a d20. Oh, ten.

1629
01:56:39,374 --> 01:56:47,078
MATT: You're not sure. You're not very involved or
invested in the cycles of the moon.

1630
01:56:47,078 --> 01:56:53,861
ASHLEY: You know, I could talk to Keyleth about
that. She would know.

1631
01:56:53,861 --> 01:56:55,310
MATT: "Very well."

1632
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:58,976
ASHLEY: And thank you for telling me all of this.

1633
01:56:58,976 --> 01:57:05,793
MATT: "Thank you for being so kind to family that
you owe nothing to."

1634
01:57:05,793 --> 01:57:30,716
ASHLEY: I'm very grateful that you're here, and
even though our last name has a reputation, I'm

1635
01:57:30,716 --> 01:57:34,805
proud to be a Trickfoot.

1636
01:57:34,805 --> 01:57:44,123
MATT: "That warms my heart, and to hear you say
that, maybe one day I will be, as well, before my

1637
01:57:44,123 --> 01:57:46,341
"time is up."

1638
01:57:46,341 --> 01:57:50,120
ASHLEY: I think we can make that happen.

1639
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:55,866
MATT: "I think so, too." He reaches out and
pinches the air about a foot off of your face.

1640
01:57:55,866 --> 01:57:59,722
"There it is."

1641
01:57:59,722 --> 01:58:08,944
ASHLEY: Well, let's go back. I have some thinking
to do.

1642
01:58:08,944 --> 01:58:12,222
MATT: "All right. Your gray blob is very nice."

1643
01:58:12,222 --> 01:58:16,931
ASHLEY: Oh. Yes, she is.

1644
01:58:16,931 --> 01:58:22,617
MATT: "Thank you for showing me. If you don't
mind?"

1645
01:58:22,617 --> 01:58:24,047
ASHLEY: Oh, of course.

1646
01:58:24,047 --> 01:58:28,519
MATT: (grunts) You guys begin to slowly make your
way back to Castle Whitestone. That's where we're

1647
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:31,133
going to take our break. We'll come back here in a
few minutes.

1648
01:58:31,133 --> 01:58:36,819
TRAVIS: (laughing) Kill him, Pike! Kill the bearer
of bad news.

1649
01:58:36,819 --> 01:58:41,026
MATT: And Flame Strike! All right, guys. We'll be
back here in just a minute. We do have another

1650
01:58:41,026 --> 01:58:45,794
Wyrmwood giveaway in the chat room. This is for
this awesome--

1651
01:58:45,794 --> 01:58:48,071
ASHLEY: Are we still going?

1652
01:58:48,071 --> 01:58:49,386
CREW: It's still going.

1653
01:58:49,386 --> 01:58:50,589
ASHLEY: Oh!

1654
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:55,351
MATT: We're still going. This is lacewood.
Lacewood deck box.

1655
01:58:55,351 --> 01:58:58,273
TRAVIS: Is it made of lace?

1656
01:58:58,273 --> 01:59:00,661
MATT: It's made of wood that is lacy.

1657
01:59:00,661 --> 01:59:04,763
LAURA: It is really pretty. I haven't seen that
one.

1658
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:07,341
MARISHA: I'm kind of jelly. Why didn't we get
lacewood?

1659
01:59:07,341 --> 01:59:12,621
MATT: I don't know. Well, now you get to get a
wood that everyone on here is jealous of. If you

1660
01:59:12,621 --> 01:59:20,034
go ahead and enter, the code word in the Twitch
chat is 'family', so when you're prompted, go ahead

1661
01:59:20,034 --> 01:59:24,909
and put 'family' and see if you can win. See you
guys here in a few minutes.

1662
01:59:24,966 --> 02:16:10,916
[break]

1663
02:16:10,991 --> 02:16:14,368
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. First and foremost-- nice try,

1664
02:16:14,368 --> 02:16:21,139
guys. First and foremost, we have our winner for
the break. It is, and pardon me for butchering

1665
02:16:21,139 --> 02:16:30,515
your chat handle, emiliaaldean.
E-M-I-L-I-A-A-L-D-E-A-N. Emelialdean.

1666
02:16:30,515 --> 02:16:36,362
Congratulations! You won your fantastic Wyrmwood
card case. It will come to you, signed by the

1667
02:16:36,362 --> 02:16:46,916
cast, for you to put things inside. Put things
inside! Put many things inside. Now! Back into the

1668
02:16:46,916 --> 02:16:55,549
game, guys. So, Pike. Having walked him back to
the castle, we'll jump in for a moment as Vex,

1669
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:56,976
you've been leading JB.

1670
02:16:56,976 --> 02:16:57,887
LAURA: I have!

1671
02:16:57,887 --> 02:17:03,485
MATT: She walks alongside you at a comfortable
three-foot distance, but she's walking with you.

1672
02:17:03,485 --> 02:17:06,813
LAURA: You know you can walk next to me?

1673
02:17:06,813 --> 02:17:08,608
MATT: "I am walking next to you."

1674
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:11,629
LAURA: Oh, I thought she was walking behind me. Is
she walking next to me?

1675
02:17:11,629 --> 02:17:14,479
MATT: She's behind and to the side.

1676
02:17:14,479 --> 02:17:18,499
LAURA: No, seriously. Come over here. I don't want
to turn my head when I'm talking to you, dear.

1677
02:17:18,499 --> 02:17:26,607
MATT: "Right." She quickens her pace. You know,
gnomish gait.

1678
02:17:26,607 --> 02:17:34,797
LAURA: I walk slower. So this is my home. We just
built it. Isn't it wonderful?

1679
02:17:34,866 --> 02:17:37,786
MATT: "It's beautiful."

1680
02:17:37,786 --> 02:17:39,330
LAURA: Yes.

1681
02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:41,597
MATT: "What's it like having a home?"

1682
02:17:41,597 --> 02:17:52,085
LAURA: Oh. I went a long time without one, as
well. It feels wonderful to finally have someplace

1683
02:17:52,085 --> 02:17:53,808
to settle down.

1684
02:17:53,808 --> 02:18:00,294
MATT: "That's very nice. We're always moving from
place to place."

1685
02:18:00,341 --> 02:18:02,207
LAURA: Yeah. Why is that?

1686
02:18:02,207 --> 02:18:13,422
MATT: "We can't afford to put stakes down
anywhere, and it doesn't take long for people to

1687
02:18:13,422 --> 02:18:16,662
"figure out who we are."

1688
02:18:16,662 --> 02:18:18,684
LAURA: What are you?

1689
02:18:18,684 --> 02:18:20,959
MATT: "Trickfoots?"

1690
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:26,039
LAURA: Well, yes. I know. I know that. But my
experience with Trickfoots has always been

1691
02:18:26,039 --> 02:18:27,407
pleasant.

1692
02:18:27,407 --> 02:18:37,779
MATT: "Let's just say that some of our family
aren't the most subtle." She looks down and to the

1693
02:18:37,779 --> 02:18:45,928
side and averts her gaze. "They're good people.
They're very good people. Johann has done a lot

1694
02:18:45,928 --> 02:18:54,566
"for us, but he's more prideful than the rest of
us. As soon as anyone starts any shit, he's the

1695
02:18:54,566 --> 02:19:01,238
"first to get in their face about it. He's a fiery
one. It's why Astra took to him."

1696
02:19:01,238 --> 02:19:03,664
LAURA: She's fiery as well, it seems.

1697
02:19:03,664 --> 02:19:05,673
MATT: "She's something."

1698
02:19:05,673 --> 02:19:09,764
LAURA: If you could settle down anywhere, where
would it be?

1699
02:19:09,764 --> 02:19:20,499
MATT: She looks around at the whole city.
"Probably right here."

1700
02:19:20,499 --> 02:19:23,265
LAURA: Whitestone is quite wonderful.

1701
02:19:23,265 --> 02:19:31,792
MATT: "It's very nice. People here are far less
dubious than the folks in

1702
02:19:31,792 --> 02:19:34,062
"Kymal, at the very least."

1703
02:19:34,062 --> 02:19:36,548
LAURA: Pike's buttered us up quite well.

1704
02:19:36,548 --> 02:19:42,905
MATT: "I miss her a lot. We grew up together. I
don't know if you knew that."

1705
02:19:42,905 --> 02:19:46,953
LAURA: I heard. How old was she when she left?

1706
02:19:46,953 --> 02:19:56,183
MATT: "I don't know the specifics of it, but me
and her were both in our first decade."

1707
02:19:56,183 --> 02:20:02,274
LAURA: What was that like, having Pike leave and
you staying behind?

1708
02:20:02,274 --> 02:20:24,792
MATT: "We were friends. She was my only friend, at
the time. I've always been a reader. They tell me

1709
02:20:24,792 --> 02:20:36,291
"the first of my kind, so I didn't take to making
new friends very well. That, and Uncle needs

1710
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:43,745
"someone to look after him, and I didn't really
want to drop the ball on that."

1711
02:20:43,745 --> 02:20:46,137
LAURA: Well, you're a good person.

1712
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:48,603
MATT: "I'm a person."

1713
02:20:48,603 --> 02:20:50,947
LAURA: Would you like to see the library?

1714
02:20:50,947 --> 02:20:52,663
MATT: "You have a library?"

1715
02:20:52,663 --> 02:20:53,915
LAURA: It's growing.

1716
02:20:53,915 --> 02:20:56,628
MATT: "Yes, please!"

1717
02:20:56,628 --> 02:20:59,438
LAURA: I don't know how big the library is right
now.

1718
02:20:59,438 --> 02:21:01,868
MATT: (laughs) In Castle Whitestone?

1719
02:21:01,868 --> 02:21:04,703
LAURA: I mean, it's my particular--

1720
02:21:04,703 --> 02:21:07,020
MATT: Oh, your personal library? It's not huge.

1721
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:08,047
LAURA: I'm growing it!

1722
02:21:08,047 --> 02:21:13,595
MATT: I know, but it took a while to construct it,
and then some books have made their way in. It's

1723
02:21:13,669 --> 02:21:21,269
maybe a third full, but as you show her, she's
like, "What kind of books do you have?"

1724
02:21:21,269 --> 02:21:32,682
LAURA: Oh, well, a lot of books about really
terrible gods. Some good gods. Oh! I have

1725
02:21:32,682 --> 02:21:37,538
something about the Feywild; I remember picking
that up. Would you like to learn about the

1726
02:21:37,538 --> 02:21:38,498
Feywild?

1727
02:21:38,498 --> 02:21:41,334
MATT: "Yeah. I've only heard a few things."

1728
02:21:41,334 --> 02:21:43,475
LAURA: I go dig through my books and find it.

1729
02:21:43,475 --> 02:21:47,214
MATT: She takes her straightened hair to the side,
and she nervously steps back with it and smiles

1730
02:21:47,214 --> 02:21:50,186
with her little gap tooth. "Are you sure?"

1731
02:21:50,186 --> 02:21:56,866
LAURA: Of course. Have you ever learned anything
about the curse on your family? Have you seen that

1732
02:21:56,866 --> 02:21:58,762
in books?

1733
02:21:58,762 --> 02:22:05,357
MATT: She starts getting a little dark and says,
"Not in the books, no. Nobody really writes books

1734
02:22:05,357 --> 02:22:15,924
"about the Trickfoots. I know what Ogden's talked about,
and why we're here.

1735
02:22:16,109 --> 02:22:19,759
"I think he wants to try and help."

1736
02:22:19,759 --> 02:22:27,225
LAURA: Right. Have you ever seen anyone be
affected by it, personally?

1737
02:22:27,225 --> 02:22:37,532
MATT: "Not in my lifetime. The last one Ogden went
to was before our time, me and Pike. It doesn't

1738
02:22:37,532 --> 02:22:40,235
"happen often-- the vision, at least."

1739
02:22:40,235 --> 02:22:42,153
LAURA: Well, that's good.

1740
02:22:42,153 --> 02:22:44,376
MATT: "I don't know if it's a coming of age thing
or not."

1741
02:22:44,376 --> 02:22:48,650
LAURA: But you've never had any visions.

1742
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:53,815
MATT: "No. I wish I did. That would be
interesting. Would be different."

1743
02:22:53,815 --> 02:22:57,547
LAURA: You are quite different. That's something
to be proud of.

1744
02:22:57,547 --> 02:23:00,876
MATT: She takes the book. (sighs)

1745
02:23:00,876 --> 02:23:10,930
LAURA: You know, one of my very best friends,
Taryon Darrington, is an incredible writer, and I

1746
02:23:10,930 --> 02:23:16,078
bet if you told him about the curse, he'd be
willing to write it down.

1747
02:23:16,151 --> 02:23:18,534
MATT: "Really?"

1748
02:23:18,534 --> 02:23:22,262
LAURA: Oh yes. You would go into complete detail
about it, and he would make it sound very

1749
02:23:22,262 --> 02:23:27,961
interesting. Maybe we could have somebody draw
pictures for it!

1750
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:31,887
MATT: (stutters) "Okay."

1751
02:23:31,887 --> 02:23:33,502
LAURA: Trickfoots could be legends.

1752
02:23:33,502 --> 02:23:36,676
MATT: "Well, you already have one."

1753
02:23:36,676 --> 02:23:40,674
LAURA: Well, yes. But there are multiple
chapters.

1754
02:23:40,674 --> 02:23:46,515
MATT: "Okay. Well, we'd have to talk to Uncle
Ogden about that;

1755
02:23:46,515 --> 02:23:48,598
"he knows it better than anybody."

1756
02:23:48,598 --> 02:23:54,257
LAURA: Of course, yes. We'll sit down with him,
but I bet you know quite a few details, as well,

1757
02:23:54,257 --> 02:23:56,465
having taken care of him for so long.

1758
02:23:56,465 --> 02:23:58,179
MATT: "Maybe. I don't know."

1759
02:23:58,179 --> 02:24:01,794
LAURA: We should find Tary. Take that with you.

1760
02:24:01,794 --> 02:24:03,259
MATT: "You're sure?"

1761
02:24:03,259 --> 02:24:05,488
LAURA: Yes, yes. We can talk about it on the way
back.

1762
02:24:05,488 --> 02:24:16,171
MATT: "Okay." She follows after you as you guys
head back to the castle. Eventually you guys

1763
02:24:16,171 --> 02:24:21,136
stumble up to the castle, and there's Taryon with
Doty. What are you guys in the process of doing

1764
02:24:21,136 --> 02:24:22,163
right now?

1765
02:24:22,163 --> 02:24:23,607
SAM: He's combing my hair.

1766
02:24:23,607 --> 02:24:25,508
MATT: "Tary."

1767
02:24:25,508 --> 02:24:28,347
LAURA: Tary?

1768
02:24:28,347 --> 02:24:35,981
SAM: 33, 34, 35. Oh, LE Girl. How are you?

1769
02:24:35,981 --> 02:24:43,754
LAURA: Hi, darling. So, our dear friend JB, here.
I told her what a wonderful writer you are.

1770
02:24:43,754 --> 02:24:48,234
SAM: Well, yes. Unpublished as of yet, as we all
know.

1771
02:24:48,234 --> 02:24:49,818
LAURA: It's a growing book.

1772
02:24:49,818 --> 02:24:50,761
SAM: Budding.

1773
02:24:50,761 --> 02:24:54,572
LAURA: Yes. And I told her it might be fun if we
wrote down a little about the

1774
02:24:54,572 --> 02:24:56,253
Trickfoots and their curse.

1775
02:24:56,253 --> 02:24:57,287
SAM: Oh.

1776
02:24:57,287 --> 02:25:00,849
LAURA: Something so other people can learn about
them.

1777
02:25:00,849 --> 02:25:03,062
SAM: Like a short story or something?

1778
02:25:03,062 --> 02:25:04,552
LAURA: Mm-hm.

1779
02:25:04,552 --> 02:25:09,399
SAM: I mean, sure, they could write something like
that. I would maybe even read it someday.

1780
02:25:09,399 --> 02:25:15,030
LAURA: No, I want her to tell you about it, and
you can write it down. That way we have all the

1781
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:15,981
details.

1782
02:25:15,981 --> 02:25:16,943
SAM: Oh.

1783
02:25:16,943 --> 02:25:19,311
LAURA: You know, you're such a wonderful writer,
dear.

1784
02:25:19,311 --> 02:25:26,027
SAM: I am a wonderful writer, but, you know, my
story has intrigue and danger and romance--

1785
02:25:26,027 --> 02:25:29,189
LAURA: There's all those things in the curse,
darling. Maybe just write a new book for the time

1786
02:25:29,189 --> 02:25:30,806
being, just a small other book?

1787
02:25:30,806 --> 02:25:35,436
SAM: Seems like a bit of a downer, just a book
about a curse, I mean. You know how it's gonna

1788
02:25:35,436 --> 02:25:37,347
end. Someone's gonna get cursed.

1789
02:25:37,347 --> 02:25:38,397
LAURA: Doty.

1790
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:49,839
SAM: What? Oh. Oh! Yes. Yes! Of course. I would be
happy to take down her story. Yes, absolutely, if

1791
02:25:50,070 --> 02:25:51,952
she'll share it with me.

1792
02:25:51,952 --> 02:25:53,650
LAURA: I mean, if she's willing.

1793
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:57,776
MATT: "I mean, yeah. We should get Ogden, though.
He knows more than I do about it."

1794
02:25:57,776 --> 02:26:00,528
LAURA: Of course, of course, you can just tell us
a little bit about it while we go get him.

1795
02:26:00,528 --> 02:26:05,059
SAM: We could call it an outline and then Ogden
can fill in the details later.

1796
02:26:05,059 --> 02:26:06,561
LAURA: Of course. Flourish.

1797
02:26:06,561 --> 02:26:15,842
MATT: "Okay." And she goes in to tell you what she
knows of the curse, in fair detail, talking about

1798
02:26:15,842 --> 02:26:24,307
how, long ago, there was people in the family that
apparently killed a brother and pissed off a god,

1799
02:26:24,307 --> 02:26:31,931
and ever since, the family was cursed, so they
left what was once the gnomish city of Wittebach.

1800
02:26:31,931 --> 02:26:40,856
And the curse seems to manifest when a Trickfoot
falls too deep into the spell of selfishness or

1801
02:26:40,856 --> 02:26:45,939
dark thoughts and habits, and manifests in these
shades that eventually hollow them out to the

1802
02:26:45,939 --> 02:26:49,344
point where they are nothing but a being of
avarice and greed.

1803
02:26:49,344 --> 02:26:52,367
LAURA: Of greed, hm?

1804
02:26:52,367 --> 02:27:00,206
MATT: "Well, it's part of the reason that we have
such a bad reputation. Those that befell the curse

1805
02:27:00,206 --> 02:27:03,821
"kind of tore a path through the countryside."

1806
02:27:03,821 --> 02:27:13,119
LAURA: Now, you say 'hollowed out by shades'. Do
you still look like a normal gnome, or?

1807
02:27:13,119 --> 02:27:16,059
MATT: "I haven't seen anyone. I don't know. This
is stuff that I heard from Uncle Ogden."

1808
02:27:16,059 --> 02:27:19,326
LAURA: Wow. I wonder what that looks like.

1809
02:27:19,326 --> 02:27:22,073
MATT: "Hopefully we never find out."

1810
02:27:22,073 --> 02:27:27,432
LAURA: Well, no, obviously. But just for detail,
so we can illustrate it.

1811
02:27:27,432 --> 02:27:33,143
SAM: The curse only manifests itself in those who
bring it upon themselves with greed, or?

1812
02:27:33,143 --> 02:27:36,824
MATT: "Those that draw too close to it, that's
what I know about it."

1813
02:27:36,824 --> 02:27:39,176
LAURA: Well, how can Pike be at risk, then?

1814
02:27:39,176 --> 02:27:40,271
SAM: That seems odd.

1815
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:42,307
LAURA: She's one of the most generous people I've
ever known.

1816
02:27:42,307 --> 02:27:44,066
SAM: Unless she's doing things that we don't know
about.

1817
02:27:44,066 --> 02:27:50,157
LAURA: No. (laughs) No. It's Pike.

1818
02:27:50,157 --> 02:27:52,208
MATT: "I know. That's why I'm worried."

1819
02:27:52,208 --> 02:27:54,172
LAURA: Yeah.

1820
02:27:54,172 --> 02:28:04,340
SAM: Well, your narrative was crude and the
language not at all descriptive, but I think we

1821
02:28:04,340 --> 02:28:10,703
have the building blocks to work with here for
something that we could turn into, you know, like

1822
02:28:10,703 --> 02:28:12,573
an essay. An essay of some sort.

1823
02:28:12,573 --> 02:28:18,521
LAURA: A good short book with a lot of drawings--

1824
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:20,610
SAM: Not a book, not a book at all, nope.

1825
02:28:20,610 --> 02:28:23,252
LAURA: -- leather cover with embossing on it or
something quite lovely.

1826
02:28:23,252 --> 02:28:25,279
SAM: I don't think it would be thick enough for
that.

1827
02:28:25,279 --> 02:28:29,494
LAURA: Gold filigree, probably, something just very
beautiful.

1828
02:28:29,542 --> 02:28:32,292
SAM: A pamphlet, maybe. A big pamphlet.

1829
02:28:32,292 --> 02:28:34,301
MATT: She's nodding. "All right, yeah."

1830
02:28:34,301 --> 02:28:35,509
SAM: We'll work on it.

1831
02:28:35,509 --> 02:28:37,320
LAURA: Yeah. Let's head back.

1832
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:44,834
MATT: "Yeah, I should go." You join up with Pike
and Ogden. You guys reconvene, now. It's getting

1833
02:28:44,834 --> 02:28:48,737
later in the day, dusk is taking. What do you wish
to do?

1834
02:28:48,737 --> 02:28:54,106
LAURA: Don't worry. I got so many details about
the curse, I know all about it.

1835
02:28:54,106 --> 02:28:58,365
ASHLEY: Oh, great. I got some details, too.

1836
02:28:58,365 --> 02:28:59,424
LAURA: Oh.

1837
02:28:59,424 --> 02:29:04,815
ASHLEY: Well, I think-- I would love to get
everybody together and just talk some stuff out.

1838
02:29:04,815 --> 02:29:15,129
LAURA: Good call. Should this just be Vox
Machina?

1839
02:29:15,129 --> 02:29:16,631
ASHLEY: Yeah, just like us.

1840
02:29:16,631 --> 02:29:17,907
LAURA: Okay.

1841
02:29:17,907 --> 02:29:27,677
TRAVIS: Percy. The string's leaving a mark in my
chin and cheeks. I feel like now is a good time to

1842
02:29:27,677 --> 02:29:34,271
put the hat back in its place of holding. Will you
guide me to the hallowed area

1843
02:29:34,271 --> 02:29:36,007
from whence it came?

1844
02:29:36,007 --> 02:29:40,475
TALIESIN: How would you know that it's leaving a
mark if you had not disturbed the string? It's

1845
02:29:40,475 --> 02:29:41,532
very important.

1846
02:29:41,532 --> 02:29:46,688
TRAVIS: It itches, and I feel deadening of the
skin in this U-shape.

1847
02:29:46,762 --> 02:29:50,506
TALIESIN: Are you saying that it's too difficult
for you to wear, that it's not working?

1848
02:29:50,506 --> 02:29:53,859
TRAVIS: Nope. It's staying on.

1849
02:29:53,859 --> 02:29:54,986
TALIESIN: All right.

1850
02:29:54,986 --> 02:29:56,906
TRAVIS: I just wanted to know if you wanted it
back.

1851
02:29:56,906 --> 02:30:03,453
TALIESIN: Let me know when you are finished with
it, and when it is time to retire it, I will make

1852
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:05,444
sure that it goes back to its resting place.

1853
02:30:05,444 --> 02:30:08,074
TRAVIS: Cool. Will do.

1854
02:30:08,074 --> 02:30:11,232
(laughter)

1855
02:30:11,232 --> 02:30:20,497
MATT: All right. Meal is prepared for the guesting
Trickfoots, specified to keep separate from

1856
02:30:20,497 --> 02:30:24,391
wherever you decide to have your meal, but you
manage to gather the rest of Vox Machina at your

1857
02:30:24,391 --> 02:30:29,572
behest to have a discussion, I imagine probably in
one of your chambers, separately from the rest of

1858
02:30:29,572 --> 02:30:34,553
the castle, where you can talk in private. So as
you all slowly gather within, we'll say Pike's

1859
02:30:34,553 --> 02:30:41,003
room for the simplicity of this, close the door
behind you, and you have all been brought

1860
02:30:41,003 --> 02:30:42,206
together.

1861
02:30:42,206 --> 02:30:44,194
MARISHA: You have a really big room, Pike.

1862
02:30:44,194 --> 02:30:47,073
ASHLEY: Yeah, it is very large.

1863
02:30:47,073 --> 02:30:51,125
MARISHA: Yeah, not that I'm comparing, I'm just,
it's very nice.

1864
02:30:51,125 --> 02:30:52,608
ASHLEY: I feel like I don't need this much room.

1865
02:30:52,608 --> 02:30:54,400
TALIESIN: I think my sister likes you.

1866
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:56,804
ASHLEY: Well, we do get along very well.

1867
02:30:56,804 --> 02:31:01,529
SAM: You've called us together for a reason?

1868
02:31:01,529 --> 02:31:11,966
ASHLEY: So I talked to-- and I know you got
information, too-- I talked to Ogden, and he told

1869
02:31:11,966 --> 02:31:22,386
me some stuff that's a little disturbing, but I
guess, you know, way back in our family there were

1870
02:31:22,386 --> 02:31:26,847
these brothers, and one of them sort of was
overcome with jealousy, and he killed the other

1871
02:31:26,847 --> 02:31:42,637
one, and basically, long story short, our family
has had a curse because of that action, and Ogden

1872
02:31:42,811 --> 02:31:55,214
wants to perform an exorcism on me to get rid of
this thing. But I don't feel any different, I

1873
02:31:55,269 --> 02:32:03,416
don't feel like I have anything, and he said, you
know, we would all have to be a part of it and go

1874
02:32:03,416 --> 02:32:11,240
on a mountaintop while there's a full moon, and I
don't know.

1875
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:14,546
LAURA: This seems weird.

1876
02:32:14,546 --> 02:32:15,860
TRAVIS: That's heavy.

1877
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:19,432
MARISHA: When you list it out like that, really
weird.

1878
02:32:19,432 --> 02:32:21,402
TALIESIN: Bit odd. Seems a bit odd.

1879
02:32:21,402 --> 02:32:24,868
SAM: Most times, family comes into town, you show
them a couple sights--

1880
02:32:24,868 --> 02:32:26,580
MARISHA: You drink a lot of wine.

1881
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:30,100
SAM: -- yeah, they leave. This seems like a
strange family visit.

1882
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:33,906
LIAM: There's a curse on you?

1883
02:32:33,906 --> 02:32:37,976
LAURA: Yeah, JB said it was brought upon by
greed.

1884
02:32:37,976 --> 02:32:39,526
SAM: And avarice.

1885
02:32:39,526 --> 02:32:40,974
LAURA: Whoa.

1886
02:32:40,974 --> 02:32:42,589
TRAVIS: What?

1887
02:32:42,589 --> 02:32:48,156
LIAM: Listen, buddy, you just learned the letter
'u' to say 'u-shaped', I think you should call

1888
02:32:48,156 --> 02:32:49,406
that a win.

1889
02:32:49,406 --> 02:32:50,699
TRAVIS: I did.

1890
02:32:50,699 --> 02:32:56,890
SAM: JB said that you would have to bring this
curse on yourself. Have you been up to-- be

1891
02:32:56,890 --> 02:32:59,070
straight with us, we're all on the same team,
here.

1892
02:32:59,070 --> 02:33:01,379
LAURA: You're not doing any drugs like Scanlan
was?

1893
02:33:01,379 --> 02:33:03,899
ASHLEY: No!

1894
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:08,735
SAM: Are you sure you don't have greed in your
heart? Lust in your heart?

1895
02:33:08,735 --> 02:33:09,793
ASHLEY: No!

1896
02:33:09,793 --> 02:33:11,618
TRAVIS: Pike, you look me in the eye.

1897
02:33:11,618 --> 02:33:12,549
ASHLEY: No.

1898
02:33:12,549 --> 02:33:13,863
TRAVIS: She's telling the truth.

1899
02:33:13,863 --> 02:33:15,658
(laughter)

1900
02:33:15,658 --> 02:33:18,379
TRAVIS: Not a lie in that little soul of hers.

1901
02:33:18,379 --> 02:33:22,264
MARISHA: It's hard to take you seriously, ever,
but even more so now with that ridiculous hat.

1902
02:33:22,264 --> 02:33:24,778
LAURA: Yeah, maybe you should take it off, it's
kind of annoying--

1903
02:33:24,778 --> 02:33:28,410
TRAVIS: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

1904
02:33:28,410 --> 02:33:31,927
(laughter)

1905
02:33:31,927 --> 02:33:34,590
LIAM: Don't let these people tear you down, Grog.

1906
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:38,455
TALIESIN: At what point will (strained) the lack
of circulation begin to make you talk like this?

1907
02:33:38,455 --> 02:33:40,456
TRAVIS: I'm gonna get you for this.

1908
02:33:40,456 --> 02:33:46,939
LIAM: And also, I mean, if we take you at your
word, and of course we do, so the curse, you--

1909
02:33:46,939 --> 02:33:56,374
you're very in tune with divine things and with
curses and things of fiendish nature. You don't

1910
02:33:56,374 --> 02:34:02,234
sense anything in yourself. It doesn't really add
up. Is it possible-- I mean, they're family, and I

1911
02:34:02,234 --> 02:34:08,116
know you love them to a degree-- but is it
possible they're jerking you around?

1912
02:34:08,116 --> 02:34:19,616
ASHLEY: Anything's possible. I just-- I don't feel
like they're lying. Unless.

1913
02:34:19,616 --> 02:34:21,967
TALIESIN: I don't feel like they're telling the
whole truth.

1914
02:34:21,967 --> 02:34:25,813
ASHLEY: Yeah. I don't feel like they're telling
the whole truth, but I think something's

1915
02:34:25,813 --> 02:34:27,840
there, and I can't seem to get to the bottom of
it.

1916
02:34:27,895 --> 02:34:29,615
LAURA: Have you prayed to Sarenrae?

1917
02:34:29,615 --> 02:34:32,897
ASHLEY: No. I haven't, yet.

1918
02:34:32,897 --> 02:34:44,030
MARISHA: I feel like we're not one to speak on
curses and bad things not existing.

1919
02:34:44,030 --> 02:34:49,024
TRAVIS: Yeah, what about a second opinion? Like
one time it was really burning when I was peeing,

1920
02:34:49,024 --> 02:34:53,418
and the guy's like, oh, eat this and it'll be
fine, and I was like, mm, I'm gonna get a second

1921
02:34:53,418 --> 02:34:54,398
opinion.

1922
02:34:54,398 --> 02:34:57,931
MARISHA: That was cranberry juice, Grog, and that
was a solid opinion.

1923
02:34:57,931 --> 02:34:59,681
TRAVIS: Yeah, it actually turned out to be true.

1924
02:34:59,681 --> 02:35:03,297
ASHLEY: That's a very good analogy.

1925
02:35:03,297 --> 02:35:13,497
SAM: What if we do this: what if we go up to the
mountain, full moon, go through the motions, and

1926
02:35:13,497 --> 02:35:21,579
Keyleth, you're super-powerful, you must have some
sort of way of telling if this Ogden is telling

1927
02:35:21,579 --> 02:35:23,296
the truth, right?

1928
02:35:23,296 --> 02:35:33,069
MARISHA: Um. I could look at his face and his
weird tics and deduce very hard.

1929
02:35:33,069 --> 02:35:35,555
TALIESIN: Talk to his tics. Does he have tics?

1930
02:35:35,555 --> 02:35:37,047
LAURA: When is the next full moon?

1931
02:35:37,047 --> 02:35:38,649
MATT: Make a nature check.

1932
02:35:38,649 --> 02:35:41,959
LIAM: Am I remembering that incorrectly?

1933
02:35:41,959 --> 02:35:43,522
ASHLEY: Yes.

1934
02:35:43,522 --> 02:35:47,460
LAURA: So maybe just try to cure yourself of this
curse. Is that possible?

1935
02:35:47,533 --> 02:35:48,351
MARISHA: 25.

1936
02:35:48,351 --> 02:35:49,825
MATT: 25. Four days.

1937
02:35:49,825 --> 02:35:52,823
TALIESIN: We'd have to start right now.

1938
02:35:52,823 --> 02:36:02,996
SAM: The other option is-- and I've been holding
onto it 'cause it's valuable-- I do happen to have

1939
02:36:02,996 --> 02:36:08,627
a Potion of Mind Reading, so we could go up there
with him and I could just read his mind.

1940
02:36:08,627 --> 02:36:10,707
LIAM: You could also do that now.

1941
02:36:10,707 --> 02:36:15,008
TRAVIS: But what if he thinks he's telling the
truth?

1942
02:36:15,008 --> 02:36:17,180
SAM: That is the smartest thing you've ever said.

1943
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:18,801
TRAVIS: This fucking hat is magic!

1944
02:36:18,801 --> 02:36:20,608
(laughter)

1945
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:25,391
ASHLEY: What if-- how much of that potion do you
have?

1946
02:36:25,391 --> 02:36:28,099
SAM: One. I have one of it.

1947
02:36:28,099 --> 02:36:33,128
ASHLEY: I mean, gnomes are small, what if we give
them all a shot?

1948
02:36:33,128 --> 02:36:38,446
LAURA: We take the potion, and then we read their
minds.

1949
02:36:38,446 --> 02:36:42,725
ASHLEY: I understand. I think I thought--

1950
02:36:42,725 --> 02:36:55,718
MARISHA: You thought it was truth serum, yeah.
Yeah, I was kinda with you there. Okay, hang on. I

1951
02:36:55,718 --> 02:36:59,758
mean, we're, as Taryon said, awesome.

1952
02:36:59,758 --> 02:37:03,458
SAM: I said that about you.

1953
02:37:03,458 --> 02:37:05,754
MARISHA: I was being generous.

1954
02:37:05,754 --> 02:37:07,064
SAM: Thank you.

1955
02:37:07,064 --> 02:37:11,949
MARISHA: If we just go through with this, is there
any harm in that?

1956
02:37:11,949 --> 02:37:20,369
TALIESIN: We should start, at the very least. My
worry is, if I understand this curse correctly,

1957
02:37:20,369 --> 02:37:25,559
the only person I think that could possibly be at
risk from it would be JB.

1958
02:37:25,559 --> 02:37:27,221
SAM: Why?

1959
02:37:27,221 --> 02:37:34,648
TALIESIN: Think about it. What avarice have any of
us ever experienced from Pike?

1960
02:37:34,648 --> 02:37:38,972
ASHLEY: I don't even know what that word means.

1961
02:37:38,972 --> 02:37:41,817
TALIESIN: I...

1962
02:37:41,817 --> 02:37:46,597
ASHLEY: Like, if you were to just define avarice.

1963
02:37:46,597 --> 02:37:49,867
SAM: You know, it's sinful in a sort of vague
way.

1964
02:37:49,867 --> 02:37:52,009
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't even--

1965
02:37:52,009 --> 02:37:54,227
LAURA: Trinket doesn't even know, and he knows
everything.

1966
02:37:54,227 --> 02:37:56,183
TRAVIS: Scholars maintain...

1967
02:37:56,183 --> 02:37:58,806
TALIESIN: What I'm saying is perhaps--

1968
02:37:58,806 --> 02:38:00,777
SAM: Google? Maybe we could Google it?

1969
02:38:00,777 --> 02:38:04,431
TALIESIN: Please do, actually. Google avarice.

1970
02:38:04,431 --> 02:38:07,517
SAM: I think it's having hate in your heart? I
think?

1971
02:38:07,517 --> 02:38:11,737
TALIESIN: Hate and greed.

1972
02:38:11,737 --> 02:38:13,820
TRAVIS: I thought it was pride.

1973
02:38:13,820 --> 02:38:16,444
MARISHA: Hate, greed, pride, any of the seven
deadly sins.

1974
02:38:16,444 --> 02:38:17,880
SAM: What is avarice?

1975
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:20,156
MATT: It's Tary.

1976
02:38:20,156 --> 02:38:27,785
TALIESIN: It's a covet-ness, it's someone is--

1977
02:38:27,785 --> 02:38:31,904
MARISHA: Man, I feel like we're really getting off
the point.

1978
02:38:31,904 --> 02:38:36,060
TALIESIN: The point I'm trying to make is, and I'm
having a notion--

1979
02:38:36,060 --> 02:38:38,778
MATT: My apologies for using a word with a--

1980
02:38:38,778 --> 02:38:40,337
LAURA: Five-dollar word.

1981
02:38:40,337 --> 02:38:42,821
MARISHA: Why did you use an SAT word, Matt? Why?

1982
02:38:42,821 --> 02:38:44,816
MATT: I read a lot of books growing up, I'm
sorry!

1983
02:38:44,816 --> 02:38:46,643
SAM: Doesn't say.

1984
02:38:46,643 --> 02:38:48,384
LIAM: It's pronounced av-riggle.

1985
02:38:48,384 --> 02:38:56,500
TALIESIN: The point I'm trying to make in all of
this is that perhaps they're trying to save one of

1986
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:59,641
their own, and perhaps they need to move the curse
to another Trickfoot.

1987
02:38:59,641 --> 02:39:01,742
SAM: Oh, it's just greed. It's just greed.

1988
02:39:01,742 --> 02:39:06,103
TRAVIS: Like I said, greed.

1989
02:39:06,103 --> 02:39:13,417
LAURA: So, wait, I have a question. What if all of
them are actually cursed, and they're trying to

1990
02:39:13,417 --> 02:39:14,681
bring you in?

1991
02:39:14,681 --> 02:39:20,885
TRAVIS: Ooh. Ooh! That's a good thought. We kill
all of them. No.

1992
02:39:20,885 --> 02:39:24,568
SAM: Yes. Yes! Of course. They'll be easily
killed, they're half our size.

1993
02:39:24,568 --> 02:39:27,257
LAURA: What did Ogden say this exorcism entailed?

1994
02:39:27,257 --> 02:39:33,982
ASHLEY: He said that we go to the highest
mountain, we have to wait 'til a full moon, you

1995
02:39:33,982 --> 02:39:41,963
have to have it be hallowed ground, and just sort
of set up a ritual, and he said maybe we could get

1996
02:39:41,963 --> 02:39:52,115
help from whomever, and I was thinking of Vax, and
I don't know! This is so beyond

1997
02:39:52,115 --> 02:39:53,519
anything that I know!

1998
02:39:53,519 --> 02:39:57,462
LAURA: And then what would happen? We just send
the curse out of you and all is well?

1999
02:39:57,462 --> 02:40:02,076
ASHLEY: I guess? This sounds so ridiculous as I'm
saying it out loud.

2000
02:40:02,076 --> 02:40:05,392
TRAVIS: I mean, do you want to go see another
cleric and see if you even

2001
02:40:05,392 --> 02:40:07,879
need to exercise or not?

2002
02:40:07,879 --> 02:40:11,449
MARISHA: Very fit.

2003
02:40:11,449 --> 02:40:13,144
LAURA: Very strong.

2004
02:40:13,144 --> 02:40:19,469
ASHLEY: I feel like I like the mind-reading serum.
We could just see.

2005
02:40:19,469 --> 02:40:24,444
We have four days 'til a full moon.

2006
02:40:24,444 --> 02:40:29,348
TALIESIN: We should start consecrating the ground,
at the very least.

2007
02:40:29,348 --> 02:40:37,044
LIAM: Also, do we really imagine whatever trouble
they might be bringing to Pike's doorstep is

2008
02:40:37,044 --> 02:40:43,495
something we can't handle? I mean, we've dealt
with pretty terrible things. I have a hard time

2009
02:40:43,495 --> 02:40:47,446
imagining it could be worse-- I'm not saying it's
not dangerous, it should be--

2010
02:40:47,446 --> 02:40:48,801
TRAVIS: Avarice.

2011
02:40:48,801 --> 02:40:56,647
LIAM: Oh, I got a nosebleed. We could just do-- I
mean, Keyleth could do her trick of turning us

2012
02:40:56,647 --> 02:41:02,783
into ladybugs or flies or whatever and we could all
hang out and follow along. I mean,

2013
02:41:02,853 --> 02:41:04,755
mind-reading first.

2014
02:41:04,755 --> 02:41:06,175
ASHLEY: I think you're allowed to be there.

2015
02:41:06,175 --> 02:41:07,240
LAURA: Yeah, we can be there.

2016
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:11,460
LIAM: We can just be there, they don't care? Oh. I
was shooting guns today.

2017
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:20,753
MARISHA: Ogden at dinner the other night said that
each generation is affected by a blood curse, and

2018
02:41:20,753 --> 02:41:28,574
he believes it's you in this generation? Because
you and JB are in the same age, right? So you're

2019
02:41:28,574 --> 02:41:35,625
the same generation. So maybe Percy's theory isn't
quite wrong.

2020
02:41:35,625 --> 02:41:37,352
SAM: Percy's very smart.

2021
02:41:37,352 --> 02:41:38,749
MARISHA: I don't know.

2022
02:41:38,749 --> 02:41:45,109
TALIESIN: I tend to veer towards the worst-case
scenario. Somebody has to.

2023
02:41:45,109 --> 02:41:47,710
LAURA: Will JB be there at the exorcism?

2024
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:49,228
TALIESIN: That is a question.

2025
02:41:49,228 --> 02:41:51,063
LAURA: We need to make sure she is, just in case.

2026
02:41:51,063 --> 02:41:53,815
MARISHA: Or isn't, just in case. Right?

2027
02:41:53,815 --> 02:41:59,005
LAURA: No. If there is a curse, and she is
affected, it would be good to get it

2028
02:41:59,005 --> 02:42:00,593
out of her as well.

2029
02:42:00,593 --> 02:42:02,748
MARISHA: But what if it goes out of Pike and into
her?

2030
02:42:02,748 --> 02:42:05,174
TRAVIS: What if it goes out of her and into Pike?

2031
02:42:05,174 --> 02:42:08,931
MARISHA: Man, so many variables.

2032
02:42:08,931 --> 02:42:17,323
SAM: We should all be there together, because
stronger in numbers, and if Pike's lying to us we

2033
02:42:17,323 --> 02:42:20,735
kill her, and if JB's lying to us we kill her.

2034
02:42:20,735 --> 02:42:26,950
ASHLEY: Well, hold on. Well, okay, yeah. If it
comes down to that, everybody, we have to know

2035
02:42:26,950 --> 02:42:28,374
that that has to be--

2036
02:42:28,374 --> 02:42:29,766
LAURA: (laughs) We're not going to kill you.

2037
02:42:29,766 --> 02:42:31,335
SAM: No, if you're infected with evil, we might
have to--

2038
02:42:31,335 --> 02:42:34,126
TRAVIS: Yeah, what does it do? Do you turn into a
crazy beast?

2039
02:42:34,126 --> 02:42:35,728
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

2040
02:42:35,728 --> 02:42:37,239
TRAVIS: Like, do you get tentacles?

2041
02:42:37,239 --> 02:42:41,021
ASHLEY: That's-- I feel like that would be an
upgrade.

2042
02:42:41,021 --> 02:42:42,994
TRAVIS: That's not really that bad.

2043
02:42:42,994 --> 02:42:45,395
ASHLEY: No. I doubt that's what it is.

2044
02:42:45,395 --> 02:42:47,155
TRAVIS: Maybe we're approaching this the wrong
way.

2045
02:42:47,155 --> 02:42:49,372
ASHLEY: I'm intrigued by this mind-reading serum.

2046
02:42:49,372 --> 02:42:53,710
SAM: I've never used it, so it should probably
work great.

2047
02:42:53,710 --> 02:42:57,433
LAURA: How much was that?

2048
02:42:57,433 --> 02:42:58,960
SAM: About a thousand.

2049
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,911
LIAM: That's not bad.

2050
02:43:00,911 --> 02:43:03,256
TRAVIS: Do it.

2051
02:43:03,256 --> 02:43:09,821
MARISHA: I mean, maybe Ogden just isn't telling
you things because he's so old, it's locked away

2052
02:43:09,821 --> 02:43:13,109
and he doesn't remember. You know?

2053
02:43:13,109 --> 02:43:14,416
LAURA: Maybe we just have to ask?

2054
02:43:14,416 --> 02:43:15,974
TALIESIN: I would check both of them.

2055
02:43:15,974 --> 02:43:16,975
TRAVIS: Do it.

2056
02:43:16,975 --> 02:43:18,367
ASHLEY: All of them. And Astra.

2057
02:43:18,367 --> 02:43:20,628
MARISHA: How long does it last?

2058
02:43:20,628 --> 02:43:29,177
SAM: I can only, I think, investigate one person--
or gnome-- at a time, but then I can move the

2059
02:43:29,177 --> 02:43:38,068
spell to other people. Let me-- Doty, give me my
notes on the spell that I took. Hold on.

2060
02:43:38,068 --> 02:43:40,033
LIAM: What time is it right now?

2061
02:43:40,033 --> 02:43:42,411
MATT: Pushing close to dusk.

2062
02:43:42,411 --> 02:43:44,785
LAURA: 9:46.

2063
02:43:44,785 --> 02:43:47,924
TALIESIN: We should perhaps do this while we're
setting up the ritual.

2064
02:43:47,924 --> 02:43:49,100
ASHLEY: Yes.

2065
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:51,825
TALIESIN: Since it'll just be up there and it'll
be natural to talk about this subject.

2066
02:43:51,825 --> 02:43:55,109
ASHLEY: And to not go when it's a full moon, so we
don't actually have to do it,

2067
02:43:55,109 --> 02:43:56,168
but we can set it up.

2068
02:43:56,168 --> 02:43:57,545
TALIESIN: Exactly. It's going to take several
days, and I'm sure we're

2069
02:43:57,545 --> 02:43:58,686
going to need their help.

2070
02:43:58,686 --> 02:44:04,848
SAM: I can shift my attention to other creatures'
thoughts, or go deeper into the same creature's

2071
02:44:04,848 --> 02:44:12,643
mind. So I can do some surface scans, and then if
I get a hit, I can go deeper.

2072
02:44:12,643 --> 02:44:17,697
TALIESIN: Prod your fingers deep into the
recesses, the nooks and crannies of their--

2073
02:44:17,697 --> 02:44:23,760
SAM: Of course, I still defer to you as my
teammates. I don't have to be the one who takes

2074
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:30,227
this serum. I did pay for it, but if one of you
wanted to do the probing, you could buy it off me,

2075
02:44:30,227 --> 02:44:31,397
I suppose.

2076
02:44:31,397 --> 02:44:34,942
ASHLEY: Well, I feel like they wouldn't be as
on-guard with you.

2077
02:44:34,942 --> 02:44:37,766
LAURA: Yeah, plus we already said you're gonna
write a book about it.

2078
02:44:37,766 --> 02:44:40,503
SAM: That's true. It fits.

2079
02:44:40,503 --> 02:44:42,055
MARISHA: It's an interview.

2080
02:44:42,055 --> 02:44:43,884
LAURA: That's really good.

2081
02:44:43,884 --> 02:44:47,868
LIAM: We could also just take them out for a drink
and get their guard down.

2082
02:44:47,868 --> 02:44:56,705
MARISHA: You don't look like you're reading
someone's mind when you're doing it, right?

2083
02:44:56,705 --> 02:44:58,447
TALIESIN: You don't have to do this.

2084
02:44:58,447 --> 02:45:02,019
LAURA: You can definitely do it to Ogden first,
then, 'cause he won't be able to tell.

2085
02:45:02,019 --> 02:45:03,377
SAM: He can't see.

2086
02:45:03,377 --> 02:45:07,488
LAURA: He can't see, so if you look weird, he
won't know. Perfect cover.

2087
02:45:07,542 --> 02:45:10,956
TALIESIN: In case you have to look weird. Do you
have to look weird while you do this?

2088
02:45:10,956 --> 02:45:13,265
LIAM: I mean, you are dressed like a Faberge egg.

2089
02:45:13,265 --> 02:45:17,290
MATT: You are welcome to look weird while you do
it.

2090
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:19,597
SAM: I feel like that's a compliment.

2091
02:45:19,597 --> 02:45:22,550
LIAM: Let's go with that.

2092
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:31,056
ASHLEY: Is there anything-- do one of you guys
wanna-- can one of you guys check me to see if

2093
02:45:31,056 --> 02:45:34,342
there's something in there that I don't know?
Vax?

2094
02:45:34,342 --> 02:45:36,258
TRAVIS: You look good.

2095
02:45:36,258 --> 02:45:38,877
MARISHA: You don't look in her ear--

2096
02:45:38,877 --> 02:45:39,915
TRAVIS: Why not?

2097
02:45:39,915 --> 02:45:44,491
LIAM: I don't think so. I mean, you're the holiest
person in this city.

2098
02:45:44,491 --> 02:45:49,740
LAURA: Can you check yourself? Just pray to
Sarenrae, see if she'll give you a little hint.

2099
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:59,252
MARISHA: Don't you have that Divine Intervention-y
thing? That Dear Sarenwae-- Sarenrae.

2100
02:45:59,252 --> 02:46:02,937
ASHLEY: Deaw Sarenwae.

2101
02:46:02,937 --> 02:46:05,305
(laughter)

2102
02:46:05,305 --> 02:46:07,669
TALIESIN: Are you listening, Sarenrae? It's me,
Pike.

2103
02:46:07,669 --> 02:46:09,234
(laughter)

2104
02:46:09,234 --> 02:46:17,868
ASHLEY: Tonight I'll see if maybe I can get some
answers. But should we-- do we do this tonight,

2105
02:46:17,868 --> 02:46:19,464
this mind-reading serum?

2106
02:46:19,464 --> 02:46:23,817
TALIESIN: I say tomorrow on the mountain.

2107
02:46:23,817 --> 02:46:26,063
SAM: I was gonna say-- it's four days, right?

2108
02:46:26,063 --> 02:46:28,806
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've got to start right now.

2109
02:46:28,806 --> 02:46:30,834
SAM: Well, I think we do it while we're up there.

2110
02:46:30,834 --> 02:46:35,117
MARISHA: Is it four days and on that night?

2111
02:46:35,117 --> 02:46:37,515
MATT: Four nights from tonight.

2112
02:46:37,515 --> 02:46:38,584
MARISHA: Four nights from tonight.

2113
02:46:38,584 --> 02:46:39,920
TALIESIN: So we have to start this immediately.

2114
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:46,064
MATT: Pretty soon. Make a history check,
Percival.

2115
02:46:46,064 --> 02:46:52,921
TALIESIN: No one bothered to listen to any of my
exciting stories about my home. All right, that's

2116
02:46:52,921 --> 02:46:55,211
a 19.

2117
02:46:55,211 --> 02:47:02,426
MATT: Okay. As far as-- from what Pike told you--
as far as high up in the mountains, and a good

2118
02:47:02,426 --> 02:47:10,252
place that you can imagine for a moonlit ceremony,
there is a place. It's a rock shelf to the

2119
02:47:10,252 --> 02:47:13,280
northeast of Whitestone on the Salted Bluffs. It's
called the Dawn Table.

2120
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:14,521
TALIESIN: The Dawn Table.

2121
02:47:14,521 --> 02:47:19,613
MATT: It's a rock shelf used for prayer when the
spring rolls around. A lot of fishermen go there

2122
02:47:19,613 --> 02:47:25,729
and leave offerings. It's meant to bring-- I
wouldn't say a good harvest, but a good season for

2123
02:47:25,729 --> 02:47:31,307
catching fish and trying to bring food back to
Whitestone, so that's pretty high up. It's gonna

2124
02:47:31,307 --> 02:47:34,941
be probably about two and a half days' travel on
foot.

2125
02:47:34,941 --> 02:47:40,604
TALIESIN: But we can carpet or teleport.

2126
02:47:40,675 --> 02:47:43,173
MATT: If you have a way of getting there.

2127
02:47:43,173 --> 02:47:45,614
MARISHA: Are there trees nearby? Are there trees
nearby?

2128
02:47:45,614 --> 02:47:49,638
TALIESIN: I'll see if I can recall if there's a
tree nearby.

2129
02:47:49,638 --> 02:47:55,246
MATT: That part of the mountain is pretty-- they
do have trees, but the trees are pretty thin.

2130
02:47:55,246 --> 02:47:59,660
They're like pine tree, that wide at the most, and
you need a pretty thick tree to

2131
02:47:59,660 --> 02:48:00,905
Transport Via Plants.

2132
02:48:00,905 --> 02:48:02,063
MARISHA: I can get us close.

2133
02:48:02,063 --> 02:48:04,078
TALIESIN: We can certainly get closer.

2134
02:48:04,078 --> 02:48:08,634
MATT: You can cut off about half a day's travel,
about a day's worth of travel, I guess.

2135
02:48:08,634 --> 02:48:16,078
MARISHA: We can also travel via being clouds, like
we've done in the past.

2136
02:48:16,078 --> 02:48:20,490
TRAVIS: We really don't wanna walk? It's so lovely
out. Danger is at an all-time low.

2137
02:48:20,490 --> 02:48:24,537
MARISHA: Or we can just hike and enjoy the
scenery. It is a nice hike. The canyons. Yeah.

2138
02:48:24,537 --> 02:48:25,837
It's rained a lot this winter.

2139
02:48:25,837 --> 02:48:28,018
LAURA: Is it okay to leave everyone here while we
go?

2140
02:48:28,018 --> 02:48:29,672
TALIESIN: It's only a few days.

2141
02:48:29,672 --> 02:48:31,663
SAM: We've got the Musketeers guarding the place.

2142
02:48:31,663 --> 02:48:33,024
LIAM: Kynan's on it.

2143
02:48:33,024 --> 02:48:38,848
MARISHA: So, okay. If it's two and a half days'
journey, and we're planning on doing this, then we

2144
02:48:38,848 --> 02:48:47,203
would have to take Ogden and the gnomes and all
things needed for this ritual, right?

2145
02:48:47,203 --> 02:48:48,706
LAURA: Yeah, I think so.

2146
02:48:48,706 --> 02:48:52,808
MARISHA: It means we would at least be framing it
like we're committing. I mean, that gives you a

2147
02:48:52,808 --> 02:49:01,167
long hike to be able to talk and mind-read the
gnomes while we walk.

2148
02:49:01,167 --> 02:49:03,108
SAM: It lasts for one minute.

2149
02:49:03,108 --> 02:49:08,595
MARISHA: It gives you a solid good minute of
hiking to read the gnomes.

2150
02:49:08,595 --> 02:49:12,907
TALIESIN: Maybe during the ritual set-up because,
I don't know, would it work while you're walking?

2151
02:49:12,907 --> 02:49:19,626
SAM: I mean, maybe, but I feel like we wait for
the big moment, and then see what's going on in

2152
02:49:19,626 --> 02:49:20,606
his head.

2153
02:49:20,606 --> 02:49:21,599
MARISHA: All right.

2154
02:49:21,599 --> 02:49:25,564
SAM: It's more dramatic that way, anyway, for the
book. And for our lives.

2155
02:49:25,564 --> 02:49:32,787
ASHLEY: And, just so you guys know, I've been
discussing with what Vex knows about it as well. I

2156
02:49:32,787 --> 02:49:43,708
think, from what he said, it's like a bunch of
shapes come out, and we would

2157
02:49:43,708 --> 02:49:45,335
all have to fight them.

2158
02:49:45,335 --> 02:49:48,022
LAURA: Shades.

2159
02:49:48,022 --> 02:49:49,556
ASHLEY: Shades, shades, shades.

2160
02:49:49,556 --> 02:49:53,844
SAM: Way to bury the lede, Pike.

2161
02:49:53,844 --> 02:49:56,261
ASHLEY: I forgot about that. My b.

2162
02:49:56,261 --> 02:49:58,939
TRAVIS: It's like, I'm cool with shapes, but.

2163
02:49:58,939 --> 02:50:02,184
TALIESIN: Not a rhombus, anything but that.

2164
02:50:02,184 --> 02:50:04,270
ASHLEY: We don't know.

2165
02:50:04,270 --> 02:50:10,332
MARISHA: Wait, shades coming from you?

2166
02:50:10,332 --> 02:50:16,831
LAURA: Maybe the curse? JB had mentioned that the
shades infest someone and hollow them out. I don't

2167
02:50:16,831 --> 02:50:19,376
know what that translates to.

2168
02:50:19,376 --> 02:50:21,550
MARISHA: You don't look shady.

2169
02:50:21,550 --> 02:50:24,514
(strained laughter)

2170
02:50:24,514 --> 02:50:42,482
MARISHA: Vax. Can you do a thing to look inside of
Pike?

2171
02:50:42,482 --> 02:50:43,783
TRAVIS: Yeah, x-ray her!

2172
02:50:43,783 --> 02:50:44,967
LAURA: Try it, just try it.

2173
02:50:44,967 --> 02:50:50,856
LIAM: The best I can do-- I mean, I can cast
Divine Sense and Lay On Hands and-- I mean, I

2174
02:50:50,856 --> 02:50:54,296
can-- poison and disease are things I can help
with, but not--

2175
02:50:54,296 --> 02:50:56,305
TRAVIS: Well, you don't even know. Give it a try.

2176
02:50:56,305 --> 02:50:59,138
LAURA: Divine Sense? Divine Sense. That sounds
like something real--

2177
02:50:59,138 --> 02:51:01,490
LIAM: Let's find out if you're a fiend or undead.

2178
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:03,651
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2179
02:51:03,651 --> 02:51:05,121
LIAM: And I do it.

2180
02:51:05,121 --> 02:51:10,343
MATT: All right. You sit there and you close your
eyes and you focus in front of you on Pike's gnome

2181
02:51:10,343 --> 02:51:16,726
form. Interestingly enough...

2182
02:51:16,782 --> 02:51:17,886
... you get nothing.

2183
02:51:17,886 --> 02:51:19,820
TRAVIS: Oh, shut up, man, don't fucking do that
shit.

2184
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:22,304
(laughter)

2185
02:51:22,304 --> 02:51:23,542
LIAM: You're welcome.

2186
02:51:23,542 --> 02:51:24,957
ASHLEY: Okay.

2187
02:51:24,957 --> 02:51:29,830
SAM: She's not wearing a wire. She's okay.

2188
02:51:29,830 --> 02:51:36,805
LIAM: Is there some embarrassing thing hidden,
tucked away, that you don't like to talk about?

2189
02:51:36,805 --> 02:51:41,646
Like, are you afraid of pickles or you don't want
to be--

2190
02:51:41,646 --> 02:51:47,528
ASHLEY: No, I mean, I talk about everything with
you guys.

2191
02:51:47,528 --> 02:51:49,587
SAM: There's no secrets that you have?

2192
02:51:49,587 --> 02:51:51,590
TRAVIS: You don't chew on your own toenails or
anything?

2193
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:55,625
SAM: No singular secret that you've kept from the
entire group the entire time we've known you?

2194
02:51:55,625 --> 02:52:01,130
TALIESIN: I feel like chewing on your own toenails
is the worst villain origin possible.

2195
02:52:01,130 --> 02:52:05,825
ASHLEY: Of course I chew on my own toenails. I
mean.

2196
02:52:05,825 --> 02:52:09,087
SAM: There's not some deep secret that you're
keeping from us?

2197
02:52:09,265 --> 02:52:13,063
ASHLEY: No, I mean, I think about one time with
Scanlan--

2198
02:52:13,063 --> 02:52:16,783
MARISHA: Wait, I feel like a story was starting!

2199
02:52:16,783 --> 02:52:18,415
LAURA: She was about to say something.

2200
02:52:18,415 --> 02:52:26,012
ASHLEY: No, you guys know this. When I got in a
lot of trouble for taking a shit on that bed. Or

2201
02:52:26,057 --> 02:52:31,086
killing the guy with the mace. Or sometimes I'll
go to a brothel.

2202
02:52:31,086 --> 02:52:33,740
But I don't do anything that bad!

2203
02:52:33,740 --> 02:52:35,322
LAURA: That's not bad.

2204
02:52:35,322 --> 02:52:39,740
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't know if there's
anything in there.

2205
02:52:39,740 --> 02:52:45,535
TALIESIN: I'm highly dubious of this entire
endeavor.

2206
02:52:45,535 --> 02:52:47,838
LAURA: I think you need to talk to Sarenrae.

2207
02:52:47,838 --> 02:52:50,323
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, when should we leave?

2208
02:52:50,323 --> 02:52:58,790
MARISHA: Well, two and a half days, I can teleport
us closer, and then we can either hike or cloud

2209
02:52:58,790 --> 02:53:00,478
the rest of the way.

2210
02:53:00,478 --> 02:53:05,703
LAURA: Would you be able to cloud the gnomes too,
though?

2211
02:53:05,703 --> 02:53:12,415
MATT: Probably not in one casting but you could do
double-cast, like two trips and get all of you up

2212
02:53:12,415 --> 02:53:13,711
pretty quick.

2213
02:53:13,711 --> 02:53:15,592
SAM: But then we'll be sitting there for two
days.

2214
02:53:15,592 --> 02:53:19,348
MARISHA: With the gnomes or the tree stride? Or
Teleport Via Plants?

2215
02:53:19,348 --> 02:53:22,180
MATT: Well, Teleport Via Plants, whoever can fit
through there in that short time, you can probably

2216
02:53:22,180 --> 02:53:28,431
get you guys and the gnomes through, but referring
to your Wind Walk, which, how many targets can

2217
02:53:28,431 --> 02:53:36,274
that affect at once? Up to ten willing creatures.

2218
02:53:36,274 --> 02:53:38,575
MARISHA: And there's how many gnomes?

2219
02:53:38,575 --> 02:53:39,848
MATT: There's four.

2220
02:53:39,848 --> 02:53:40,942
MARISHA: Four.

2221
02:53:40,942 --> 02:53:44,240
MATT: So you'd leave one behind.

2222
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:52,201
MARISHA: Then we'd leave one behind. Okay.

2223
02:53:52,201 --> 02:53:57,122
MATT: Which, you'd have to talk to them about
that.

2224
02:53:57,122 --> 02:54:01,803
ASHLEY: Are there any other clerics that we know?

2225
02:54:01,803 --> 02:54:07,181
LIAM: Not in town on your level.

2226
02:54:07,181 --> 02:54:10,072
MATT: There's Keeper Yennen, but he's like--

2227
02:54:10,072 --> 02:54:12,921
LAURA: Yeah, where did Kash go to in the last
year?

2228
02:54:12,921 --> 02:54:14,714
MATT: Kash has been in Vasselheim.

2229
02:54:14,714 --> 02:54:19,292
LIAM: I mean, and Vasselheim is chock full of
clerics, so maybe we could find help there.

2230
02:54:19,292 --> 02:54:20,841
TALIESIN: Gilmore's out of town.

2231
02:54:20,841 --> 02:54:26,021
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe we go ask them and say--

2232
02:54:26,021 --> 02:54:27,241
LAURA: Yennen?

2233
02:54:27,241 --> 02:54:34,153
ASHLEY: The family. I mean, it sounds crazy, but
maybe we just go up there, go through the

2234
02:54:34,153 --> 02:54:35,377
motions.

2235
02:54:35,377 --> 02:54:37,393
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's your show.

2236
02:54:37,393 --> 02:54:38,526
LAURA: Just do it.

2237
02:54:38,526 --> 02:54:42,788
TALIESIN: Let's do it. I'm going to get some tents
and some food put together, so we're at least

2238
02:54:42,788 --> 02:54:43,879
comfortable.

2239
02:54:43,879 --> 02:54:46,134
SAM: Are we walking, or can we get some horses at
least?

2240
02:54:46,134 --> 02:54:48,687
TALIESIN: It's not really horse-accessible.

2241
02:54:48,687 --> 02:54:51,654
LAURA: We'll be fine, Tary.

2242
02:54:51,654 --> 02:54:53,944
SAM: I'm worried about the big guy.

2243
02:54:53,944 --> 02:54:55,348
TALIESIN: The big guy will be fine.

2244
02:54:55,348 --> 02:54:57,031
SAM: I guess he can just walk.

2245
02:54:57,031 --> 02:54:58,505
TALIESIN: He can cloud-stride as well.

2246
02:54:58,505 --> 02:55:04,052
LAURA: Well, no, Doty can't mist-form, right?

2247
02:55:04,052 --> 02:55:06,329
LIAM: Can Trinket and Doty ride in your--

2248
02:55:06,329 --> 02:55:08,544
LAURA: No, Doty, I've tried to put him in the--

2249
02:55:08,544 --> 02:55:15,119
TALIESIN: One of us, in theory, should actually
perhaps take the carpet so we can put Doty on the

2250
02:55:15,119 --> 02:55:16,063
carpet.

2251
02:55:16,063 --> 02:55:17,692
LIAM: I'm sitting on the carpet right now.

2252
02:55:17,692 --> 02:55:19,880
LAURA: How heavy is Doty?

2253
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:22,167
SAM: Let me look at Matt's statistics.

2254
02:55:22,167 --> 02:55:33,026
MATT: Doty technically counts as a creature,
though it is, much like a golem or a construct of

2255
02:55:33,026 --> 02:55:38,662
some kind, it would be considered a creature. It
is a construct. So in theory, you would have to

2256
02:55:38,662 --> 02:55:43,147
tell Doty, "Doty, turn into wind." And that
probably would work.

2257
02:55:43,147 --> 02:55:46,573
SAM: I could do that.

2258
02:55:46,573 --> 02:55:48,659
MARISHA: It would take a slot out of our ten.

2259
02:55:48,659 --> 02:55:51,527
SAM: How fast does this cloud thing move?

2260
02:55:51,527 --> 02:55:57,705
MATT: It moves pretty quick. 300 feet. Flying
speed of 300, which is ten times as fast as you

2261
02:55:57,705 --> 02:56:04,707
walk. And without-- going straight up the mountain,
you could make the full journey, talking with

2262
02:56:04,884 --> 02:56:12,848
Percy about this, from the base of the mountain to
the Dawn Table in about two hours.

2263
02:56:12,848 --> 02:56:17,205
TALIESIN: We wouldn't even need the tree-stride,
to be honest, we could just do it.

2264
02:56:17,205 --> 02:56:19,193
MARISHA: Wait, from here to the base of the
mountain?

2265
02:56:19,193 --> 02:56:24,531
TALIESIN: I mean, we could do from the base of the
mountain to the top in two hours, three hours, but

2266
02:56:24,531 --> 02:56:26,992
we could make the entire journey quite quickly.

2267
02:56:26,992 --> 02:56:28,697
LAURA: So she could just double-cast.

2268
02:56:28,697 --> 02:56:32,589
MATT: The entire journey you could make in about
six and a half hours.

2269
02:56:32,589 --> 02:56:38,261
LAURA: Solid. So some people go up, you come back,
turn the rest of the people in.

2270
02:56:38,261 --> 02:56:40,110
MARISHA: With my tree-stride.

2271
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:41,255
LAURA: No.

2272
02:56:41,255 --> 02:56:42,546
MATT: Without tree-stride.

2273
02:56:42,546 --> 02:56:43,787
MARISHA: With the gas.

2274
02:56:43,787 --> 02:56:48,600
LIAM: Let's go glamping.

2275
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:52,336
MARISHA: Let's go glamping. But as long as I can
sleep afterwards.

2276
02:56:52,336 --> 02:56:55,555
TALIESIN: We'll bring tents, we're going to bring
some nice tents.

2277
02:56:55,555 --> 02:57:01,663
MATT: It lasts for eight hours, so you'll be using
most of the duration to get there, you could

2278
02:57:01,663 --> 02:57:06,664
probably fly back if you want to, or tree-stride
back if you had a tree you could find up there to

2279
02:57:06,664 --> 02:57:08,413
do it. So yeah, you could do that.

2280
02:57:08,413 --> 02:57:12,246
MARISHA: I do that.

2281
02:57:12,246 --> 02:57:23,085
MATT: Okay. So what do you do? You go and gather
up the other Trickfoots? You approach the rest of

2282
02:57:23,085 --> 02:57:24,965
them, Ogden, JB.

2283
02:57:24,965 --> 02:57:26,800
MARISHA: We're not leaving tonight, right?

2284
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:28,226
MATT: Whenever you guys want to?

2285
02:57:28,226 --> 02:57:32,926
MARISHA: Tonight? This is the same night we got
back.

2286
02:57:32,926 --> 02:57:35,575
LAURA: Oh, right, it is.

2287
02:57:35,575 --> 02:57:37,413
TALIESIN: In the morning.

2288
02:57:37,413 --> 02:57:39,365
LAURA: Okay, we'll leave in the morning, yeah.

2289
02:57:39,365 --> 02:57:40,910
SAM: At dawn, we leave.

2290
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:55,721
ASHLEY: So I'll go to them at dinner. Okay, so
we've had some discussions and I think it'll take

2291
02:57:55,721 --> 02:58:00,616
us a little bit of time to get up there and do
whatever setting-up you need to do on the top of

2292
02:58:00,616 --> 02:58:06,689
the mountain, so we were thinking, if you guys are
okay with this, of leaving tomorrow morning.

2293
02:58:06,689 --> 02:58:16,336
MATT: You can see Johann and Astra kind of turn
over to Ogden. Ogden goes, "Yes, that would be

2294
02:58:16,336 --> 02:58:20,383
"perfect. When is the next full moon?"

2295
02:58:20,383 --> 02:58:23,366
ASHLEY: It's in four days.

2296
02:58:23,366 --> 02:58:29,900
MATT: "Four days, all right. That gives us time to
prepare. I need a few things for this ritual."

2297
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:31,350
ASHLEY: Okay.

2298
02:58:31,350 --> 02:58:41,419
MATT: "I don't know how to retrieve them
necessarily. I require a jug of water that has

2299
02:58:41,419 --> 02:58:54,468
"been blessed by a priest of the Moonweaver." The
Moonweaver is one of the gods, largely elven

2300
02:58:54,468 --> 02:59:05,582
worship. You guys have crossed a number of temples
that worship the Moonweaver in Syngorn and some

2301
02:59:05,582 --> 02:59:10,777
other-- you do find them occasionally in
civilization, but they're more the kind of shrines

2302
02:59:10,777 --> 02:59:12,968
that you find out in the center of the forest.

2303
02:59:12,968 --> 02:59:14,783
LAURA: I can totally get that.

2304
02:59:14,783 --> 02:59:23,665
MATT: Goddess of the moonlight and autumn. He
says, "Also, as part of a reagent for the

2305
02:59:23,665 --> 02:59:29,175
"exorcism, a diamond worth no less than 1,000 gold
pieces that will be

2306
02:59:29,175 --> 02:59:32,077
"consumed by the actual ritual."

2307
02:59:32,077 --> 02:59:34,438
TALIESIN: That's doable, I believe.

2308
02:59:34,438 --> 02:59:42,563
MATT: "I also need a solid pound of dried
lavender, and a half a pound of powdered sulfur."

2309
02:59:42,563 --> 02:59:45,612
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure we have access to that.

2310
02:59:45,612 --> 02:59:53,228
MATT: "And, of course, you, Pike. And that should
be sufficient to complete the ritual."

2311
02:59:53,228 --> 02:59:56,704
LAURA: She's not going to be injured in this
ritual?

2312
02:59:56,796 --> 03:00:01,695
MATT: "No, no. Either the shade is cast out and
destroyed, or it's cast out and then you destroy

2313
03:00:01,695 --> 03:00:05,030
"it. Either way, you should be fine."

2314
03:00:05,030 --> 03:00:06,453
LAURA: Just the one shade, then?

2315
03:00:06,453 --> 03:00:08,035
MATT: "Depends."

2316
03:00:08,035 --> 03:00:11,434
TRAVIS: You've done this before.

2317
03:00:11,434 --> 03:00:14,350
MATT: "Twice. Three times."

2318
03:00:14,350 --> 03:00:15,748
TRAVIS: And it's always gone right.

2319
03:00:15,748 --> 03:00:18,335
MATT: "It's gone right twice."

2320
03:00:18,335 --> 03:00:20,113
TRAVIS: What happened the time it didn't?

2321
03:00:20,113 --> 03:00:25,057
MATT: "That was the first time. I didn't know what
I was in for, and I couldn't save them."

2322
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:27,275
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2323
03:00:27,275 --> 03:00:34,893
LAURA: Right. What do the people look like after
they've been taken over?

2324
03:00:34,893 --> 03:00:42,313
MATT: And you see he gets really dark and focused
in himself for a second. You see the glimmer

2325
03:00:42,313 --> 03:00:53,492
across the glasses on his face, and he goes, "They
begin to grow hatred for all those they once

2326
03:00:53,492 --> 03:01:04,533
"loved. They begin to strike out at the world
around them, take whatever they like, and those

2327
03:01:04,533 --> 03:01:16,287
"that stand in their way are merely to be cut down.
Eventually, at least from what I've seen, they

2328
03:01:16,287 --> 03:01:19,340
"continue to take until somebody cuts them down."

2329
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:22,748
LAURA: Do they just look like--

2330
03:01:22,748 --> 03:01:28,027
MATT: "They just look like themselves. But their
whole personality changes."

2331
03:01:28,027 --> 03:01:37,539
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm encouraged.

2332
03:01:37,539 --> 03:01:42,644
LAURA: Maybe they just turned into an asshole.

2333
03:01:42,644 --> 03:01:51,491
ASHLEY: That just sounds like someone who's an
asshole.

2334
03:01:51,491 --> 03:01:56,281
TALIESIN: Nothing a little lavender and sulfur
can't cure, in my experience.

2335
03:01:56,281 --> 03:02:02,053
ASHLEY: I don't feel any of these things.

2336
03:02:02,053 --> 03:02:11,754
MATT: "What I've seen are just the visions I've
had. If you wish not to go through with this, that

2337
03:02:11,754 --> 03:02:20,050
"is up to you. We can leave and be on our way. I've
just come to help if we can. If we do this ritual

2338
03:02:20,050 --> 03:02:25,206
"and nothing comes of it, then you're right as
rain."

2339
03:02:25,206 --> 03:02:31,203
LIAM: Do you have any inkling of what would happen
if you do nothing? Pike does nothing?

2340
03:02:31,203 --> 03:02:44,144
MATT: "Perhaps not now, but someday in the future,
when met with a terrible choice, if you choose a

2341
03:02:44,144 --> 03:02:54,421
"darker path, that may be the window needed for the
shades to take hold and begin to install in their

2342
03:02:54,421 --> 03:02:56,305
"dark interests."

2343
03:02:56,305 --> 03:03:00,599
TRAVIS: Are there any elements needed for this?
Water, fire?

2344
03:03:00,599 --> 03:03:03,680
MATT: "Well, I need some blessed water."

2345
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:05,348
LAURA: Which I'm totally going to go get.

2346
03:03:05,348 --> 03:03:06,813
TRAVIS: Right, you did say that.

2347
03:03:06,813 --> 03:03:09,552
LIAM: I have the lavender.

2348
03:03:09,552 --> 03:03:15,735
MATT: The sulfur represents the earth, the diamond
represents the refraction of the moonlight, and

2349
03:03:15,735 --> 03:03:17,475
the water is the catalyst.

2350
03:03:17,475 --> 03:03:20,196
MARISHA: And the lavender and sulfur?

2351
03:03:20,196 --> 03:03:24,867
MATT: The lavender is to be burned. The sulfur
represents the earth in this place, but the

2352
03:03:24,867 --> 03:03:33,361
lavender is burned as a sort of incense that helps
provide a space of the hallowed ground to present

2353
03:03:33,361 --> 03:03:37,186
a cage for this entity so it cannot flee and come
back.

2354
03:03:37,186 --> 03:03:41,033
TRAVIS: We gotta find a priest.

2355
03:03:41,033 --> 03:03:44,110
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get a pound for good
measure.

2356
03:03:44,110 --> 03:03:52,462
LAURA: They have all that shit in Syngorn. I can just go.
Right? To one of the temples of the Moonweaver or

2357
03:03:52,521 --> 03:03:53,243
something.

2358
03:03:53,243 --> 03:03:54,848
MATT: You could probably get most of that in
Syngorn with one trip, yeah.

2359
03:03:54,848 --> 03:03:56,060
LAURA: Solid.

2360
03:03:56,060 --> 03:04:05,215
MARISHA: What if what you're seeing, Ogden, and I
mean no disrespect in any way, is a possible

2361
03:04:05,215 --> 03:04:10,987
outcome or future that might not ever happen?

2362
03:04:10,987 --> 03:04:20,197
MATT: "Then Pike will be safe, I'll look the fool,
and we'll go our separate ways."

2363
03:04:20,197 --> 03:04:23,544
TALIESIN: What's a diamond?

2364
03:04:23,544 --> 03:04:29,131
LAURA: What's a diamond for our dear Pike? It's a
good price, I say.

2365
03:04:29,131 --> 03:04:44,427
ASHLEY: I say what you say that is what I say. I
say, you know what? I'm bored and I think we

2366
03:04:44,427 --> 03:04:49,900
should do it, even if it's hogwash. No offense.

2367
03:04:49,900 --> 03:04:51,161
MATT: "None taken."

2368
03:04:51,161 --> 03:04:56,634
MARISHA: And as Percy and Tary, as the science
bros have said several times, at least a negative

2369
03:04:56,634 --> 03:04:59,481
outcome is still an outcome, or something like
that.

2370
03:04:59,481 --> 03:05:00,890
TALIESIN: Something similar to it.

2371
03:05:00,890 --> 03:05:02,336
SAM: Yes. Yes.

2372
03:05:02,336 --> 03:05:08,956
MARISHA: Yeah. We'll learn things for science.

2373
03:05:08,956 --> 03:05:10,508
SAM: For science!

2374
03:05:10,508 --> 03:05:11,753
ASHLEY: For science.

2375
03:05:11,753 --> 03:05:15,101
TALIESIN: Exorcism for science. Why not.

2376
03:05:15,101 --> 03:05:17,908
(laughter)

2377
03:05:17,908 --> 03:05:19,553
MATT: That's a good bumper sticker.

2378
03:05:19,553 --> 03:05:21,959
LAURA: I should probably go to Syngorn before it
gets too late.

2379
03:05:21,959 --> 03:05:24,494
TALIESIN: We'll get the lavender and sulfur
together.

2380
03:05:24,494 --> 03:05:28,464
LIAM: I have lavender with my armor.

2381
03:05:28,532 --> 03:05:29,755
MARISHA: You need a pound of it.

2382
03:05:29,755 --> 03:05:31,826
LIAM: I have a pound of lavender with my armor.

2383
03:05:31,826 --> 03:05:33,502
(laughter)

2384
03:05:33,502 --> 03:05:36,831
TALIESIN: I'm sure I can dig up a pound of sulfur.
I figured, let's just get double what we need,

2385
03:05:36,831 --> 03:05:37,872
just to be safe.

2386
03:05:37,872 --> 03:05:40,058
LAURA: Just to be safe. Do you have two pounds of
lavender?

2387
03:05:40,058 --> 03:05:42,203
TALIESIN: We need half a pound.

2388
03:05:42,203 --> 03:05:47,862
ASHLEY: Do you just tuck it in to make it smell
nice?

2389
03:05:47,862 --> 03:05:52,901
MATT: You can cause existing lavender to bloom
stronger, otherwise the lavender you create in the

2390
03:05:52,901 --> 03:05:56,022
space will vanish once the spell is done. But
yeah.

2391
03:05:56,022 --> 03:06:00,482
LIAM: It's not in my-- I keep it in a box with my
armor so the armor won't smell like shit anymore,

2392
03:06:00,482 --> 03:06:07,058
people. It's not-- is there a problem with a man
having lavender in his possession?

2393
03:06:07,058 --> 03:06:09,696
TALIESIN: You keep your armor in a box filled with
lavender?

2394
03:06:09,696 --> 03:06:11,241
LIAM: Yes, I do.

2395
03:06:11,241 --> 03:06:13,003
LAURA: Yeah, so it smells fresh and clean.

2396
03:06:13,003 --> 03:06:14,393
TALIESIN: Does it smell fresh and clean?

2397
03:06:14,393 --> 03:06:15,968
LIAM: It does now, man.

2398
03:06:15,968 --> 03:06:17,301
TALIESIN: All right.

2399
03:06:17,301 --> 03:06:24,681
LIAM: I've had 12 months of downtime to figure my
shit out. My armor is tight now.

2400
03:06:24,681 --> 03:06:27,388
TALIESIN: Your armor now smells like a
grandmother's bathroom.

2401
03:06:27,388 --> 03:06:31,211
LIAM: Take your guilt trips and bring them back to
dad. I don't need them.

2402
03:06:31,211 --> 03:06:35,040
LAURA: What are you talking about? I'm on my way
to go give those guilt trips.

2403
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:37,594
SAM: I have little potpourri bags in almost
everything I own.

2404
03:06:37,594 --> 03:06:38,770
TALIESIN: He does, it's true.

2405
03:06:38,770 --> 03:06:40,441
TRAVIS: Really?

2406
03:06:40,441 --> 03:06:42,212
SAM: Yes.

2407
03:06:42,212 --> 03:06:44,201
LAURA: He started leaving them around the house.

2408
03:06:44,201 --> 03:06:45,656
TALIESIN: He calls them sachets.

2409
03:06:45,656 --> 03:06:50,247
SAM: Let's do it.

2410
03:06:50,247 --> 03:06:53,541
MATT: All right, so you guys go to bed.

2411
03:06:53,541 --> 03:06:54,672
LAURA: I go to Syngorn.

2412
03:06:54,672 --> 03:06:55,759
MATT: Okay.

2413
03:06:55,759 --> 03:07:00,288
TRAVIS: Can I attune to my blood axe instead of
the thrower before I go to sleep?

2414
03:07:00,288 --> 03:07:01,266
MATT: That you can.

2415
03:07:01,266 --> 03:07:02,106
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2416
03:07:02,106 --> 03:07:07,848
TALIESIN: I'm going to let the castle know I'm
taking a brief, brief run up the hill and grabbing

2417
03:07:07,848 --> 03:07:12,408
supplies for this, so letting everyone know.
Grabbing a few tents.

2418
03:07:12,408 --> 03:07:17,702
MATT: They have supplies for you at the ready. You
gather them easily from the Pale Guard. They have

2419
03:07:17,702 --> 03:07:22,505
some tents that haven't been used for a while, you
take those with you. Supplies are given. You head

2420
03:07:22,505 --> 03:07:25,300
to Syngorn. Make an investigation check.

2421
03:07:25,300 --> 03:07:31,200
LAURA: I should probably have brought someone with
me just in case I suck at this. That's cocked.

2422
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:34,292
That's cocked if I've ever seen cocked.

2423
03:07:34,292 --> 03:07:37,400
LIAM: That's good. That's a good one.

2424
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:40,700
LAURA: Investigation. 20.

2425
03:07:40,700 --> 03:07:45,148
MATT: Yeah. Within a short time, as the evening
draws in, it's not a full moon, but it's still a

2426
03:07:45,148 --> 03:07:52,768
very big moonlit night and you find in Syngorn one
of the larger temples to the Moonweaver, there's a

2427
03:07:52,768 --> 03:08:01,702
night guide there named Nusem, and it's the temple
of the Pale Light. And so, as you approach him and

2428
03:08:01,702 --> 03:08:07,715
give your request, he's like, "A jug of our
blessed water, that is an unusual request. We take

2429
03:08:07,715 --> 03:08:11,748
"no money, but offerings in trade of equal value as
you honestly see fit."

2430
03:08:11,748 --> 03:08:14,539
TRAVIS: Give him a high-five.

2431
03:08:14,539 --> 03:08:18,438
(laughter)

2432
03:08:18,438 --> 03:08:21,499
LAURA: Right. Well, I don't have very much on my
person.

2433
03:08:21,499 --> 03:08:28,292
MATT: "Whatever you feel would be a viable trade
within the eyes of the Moonweaver herself."

2434
03:08:28,292 --> 03:08:30,453
LAURA: What do I know about the Moonweaver?

2435
03:08:30,453 --> 03:08:32,407
MATT: Roll a religion check.

2436
03:08:32,407 --> 03:08:37,105
LAURA: Oh god. Imma roll my moonstone dice for
this.

2437
03:08:37,105 --> 03:08:38,473
MATT: Do it.

2438
03:08:38,473 --> 03:08:42,155
LAURA: What am I rolling?

2439
03:08:42,155 --> 03:08:43,395
MATT: Religion.

2440
03:08:43,395 --> 03:08:46,148
LAURA: A religion, jeez. 11.

2441
03:08:46,148 --> 03:08:55,882
MATT: 11. You know that she is the goddess of the
moon, the night, and of autumn. She is known as--

2442
03:08:55,882 --> 03:09:01,487
she doesn't fall on the good or bad spectrum,
she's generally a bit of a trickster, but however

2443
03:09:01,487 --> 03:09:11,775
tends to be used or at least called to by young
love to bless trysts to not be discovered. That's

2444
03:09:11,775 --> 03:09:14,898
kind of the gist of what you can pick up on that
roll, yeah.

2445
03:09:14,898 --> 03:09:24,155
LAURA: All right. I have a small flask of Courage.
I feel like she would appreciate this.

2446
03:09:24,155 --> 03:09:34,629
MATT: Takes a moment, looks at it. "I think the
goddess will be pleased." And he puts it in his

2447
03:09:34,629 --> 03:09:42,297
robes and he takes the blessed water and hands it
to you. It's a small, pretty heavy-- especially

2448
03:09:42,297 --> 03:09:48,448
when it's filled-- clay pot that is sealed at the
top with multiple rounds of rope and some sort of

2449
03:09:48,448 --> 03:09:54,383
a dark black tar-like substance that seems to seal
the top and he passes it over to you

2450
03:09:54,383 --> 03:09:55,439
and you take it.

2451
03:09:55,439 --> 03:09:58,169
LAURA: I didn't think this part through. Thank you
very much.

2452
03:09:58,169 --> 03:09:59,601
LIAM: Strength of seven.

2453
03:09:59,601 --> 03:10:05,567
LAURA: That's right. What is my strength? It is
seven. I'm as weak as Grog is stupid.

2454
03:10:05,567 --> 03:10:09,958
(laughter)

2455
03:10:09,958 --> 03:10:15,491
LAURA: No, I'm just a little bit stronger. Not
quite as bad.

2456
03:10:15,491 --> 03:10:21,872
MATT: All right, so you gather that, you find your
way back without issue. We'll say without issue.

2457
03:10:21,872 --> 03:10:25,432
LAURA: You know what, I'm just gonna pass it over
to Trinket and make him hold it.

2458
03:10:25,432 --> 03:10:31,922
MATT: Okay, so you attach it to Trinket's armor on
the top. Easy enough. So you guys eventually make

2459
03:10:31,922 --> 03:10:37,367
your way back to the town. You guys find an
evening of rest, you complete, restore your

2460
03:10:37,367 --> 03:10:47,361
spells, you, sulfur, go ahead and make a tinkering
check. This is intelligence modifier and

2461
03:10:47,361 --> 03:10:49,036
proficiency bonus.

2462
03:10:49,036 --> 03:10:55,400
TALIESIN: That's okay. 19?

2463
03:10:55,400 --> 03:11:02,204
MATT: Yeah, okay. For you, 'cause most of the
sulfur that you have currently has already been

2464
03:11:02,204 --> 03:11:09,354
put in with the salpeter and other means of
creating the gunpowder, so you have to

2465
03:11:09,354 --> 03:11:15,939
reverse-engineer a lot of it. It's not going to be
pure, what you have, or at least not all of it. I

2466
03:11:15,939 --> 03:11:20,820
mean, you have some pure sulfur still, but to get
the full half-pound of it, it's gonna be a little

2467
03:11:20,820 --> 03:11:32,884
dirty. But you manage to get it to happen. And Vax
is providing the lavender. Okay. All righty. And

2468
03:11:32,884 --> 03:11:35,591
the diamond, who's giving the diamond? Or do you
have one?

2469
03:11:35,591 --> 03:11:36,917
LAURA: I've got a diamond.

2470
03:11:36,917 --> 03:11:38,308
MATT: How much is it worth?

2471
03:11:38,308 --> 03:11:39,542
LAURA: I've got multiple diamonds.

2472
03:11:39,542 --> 03:11:41,648
MATT: Well, choose a diamond.

2473
03:11:41,648 --> 03:11:47,610
LAURA: I'll choose one that's worth-- in my bag of
gems-- no, that's not right.

2474
03:11:47,610 --> 03:11:51,649
LIAM: "In my-- nah. Right here in my-- nope."

2475
03:11:51,649 --> 03:11:56,384
LAURA: All right, fine, I've got two diamonds,
both worth 1,500. I don't have a thousand-gold

2476
03:11:56,384 --> 03:11:57,321
diamond.

2477
03:11:57,321 --> 03:11:58,599
MATT: All right. That'll suffice.

2478
03:11:58,599 --> 03:12:01,773
LAURA: Yeah, but it's a waste. It's okay.

2479
03:12:01,773 --> 03:12:03,141
ASHLEY: It's a waste of 500.

2480
03:12:03,141 --> 03:12:04,947
MATT: All righty. So.

2481
03:12:04,947 --> 03:12:07,906
LAURA: It's Pike. It's worth it.

2482
03:12:07,906 --> 03:12:13,402
MATT: As the morning comes, you all awaken, you
gather your materials, you assess as a pool what

2483
03:12:13,402 --> 03:12:20,526
you have at your disposal and presenting these
various elements that you've gathered before Uncle

2484
03:12:20,526 --> 03:12:25,631
Ogden, he inspects each one very carefully,
sniffing the sulfur, feeling and tasting the

2485
03:12:25,631 --> 03:12:31,423
lavender, takes the water and brushes his fingers
through it, takes the diamond and inspects it,

2486
03:12:31,423 --> 03:12:38,712
sets it all down on the table, and goes, "Yes.
This will suffice. Whenever you're ready, let's

2487
03:12:38,712 --> 03:12:43,054
"make our way to wherever you find is necessary to
do this ritual."

2488
03:12:43,054 --> 03:12:44,698
TALIESIN: I think you'll be quite pleased.

2489
03:12:44,698 --> 03:12:45,968
MATT: "Very well."

2490
03:12:45,968 --> 03:12:48,139
LAURA: Keep an eye on those goods, brother.

2491
03:12:48,139 --> 03:12:52,696
MATT: "Trickfoots. Trickfoots? Trickfoots!"
They're all right around him, and he's like,

2492
03:12:52,696 --> 03:13:00,391
"Hello? Anyone?" Johann reaches out and touches
his shoulder. "Ah! Yes, there you are. Come, we

2493
03:13:00,391 --> 03:13:07,331
"have an exorcism." And so they follow you as you
grab your materials. How are you doing this?

2494
03:13:07,331 --> 03:13:08,887
You're doing multiple trips?

2495
03:13:08,887 --> 03:13:12,261
MARISHA: I was tree-striding us all to the base of
the mountain, right?

2496
03:13:12,261 --> 03:13:15,078
SAM: Nope, you were gonna gas us all the way
there.

2497
03:13:15,078 --> 03:13:20,268
MARISHA: That's what I'm doing? Okay. Double-gas.

2498
03:13:20,268 --> 03:13:21,728
TALIESIN: It's a gas.

2499
03:13:21,728 --> 03:13:31,179
MATT: Okay. Early morning, with the Wind Walk, you
can get ten creatures, which is you seven, plus--

2500
03:13:31,179 --> 03:13:35,290
you put Trinket in your necklace-- Doty, which is
eight, and you can take two of the gnomes if you'd

2501
03:13:35,290 --> 03:13:38,178
like, or would you prefer to leave with the four
of them and them come back for them?

2502
03:13:38,178 --> 03:13:43,042
TALIESIN: I would say, let's get all of the gnomes
up there first so they can begin setting

2503
03:13:43,042 --> 03:13:44,152
everything up.

2504
03:13:44,152 --> 03:13:46,455
LAURA: Yeah. I'll stay behind.

2505
03:13:46,455 --> 03:13:48,305
LIAM: I'll go with.

2506
03:13:48,305 --> 03:13:50,874
SAM: I'll stay behind as well.

2507
03:13:50,874 --> 03:13:52,342
MARISHA: No, I'm gonna take Tary.

2508
03:13:52,342 --> 03:13:54,825
SAM: I bid you adieu.

2509
03:13:54,825 --> 03:13:58,054
(laughter)

2510
03:13:58,054 --> 03:13:59,099
LAURA: Percy can stay, right?

2511
03:13:59,099 --> 03:14:00,136
TALIESIN: I'll stay as well.

2512
03:14:00,136 --> 03:14:01,245
SAM: Ugh, gross.

2513
03:14:01,245 --> 03:14:09,905
MARISHA: I'm making a trip back. I'm gonna take
Tary, Pike, the gnomes, Vax, me, how many's left?

2514
03:14:09,905 --> 03:14:12,073
That's it, right?

2515
03:14:12,073 --> 03:14:15,005
TALIESIN: Take Doty so he can set up the tents.

2516
03:14:15,005 --> 03:14:18,056
LAURA: I think you can take everyone except for me
and Percy, right?

2517
03:14:18,056 --> 03:14:19,298
TALIESIN: Yeah, that should work.

2518
03:14:19,298 --> 03:14:20,960
TRAVIS: Yeah, please, I wanna go with Pike.

2519
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:23,060
MARISHA: And Grog will go.

2520
03:14:23,060 --> 03:14:26,044
MATT: All right, so you guys go ahead, and
utilizing the--

2521
03:14:26,044 --> 03:14:29,030
MARISHA: Why don't you guys start off on the rug?

2522
03:14:29,030 --> 03:14:31,978
LAURA: Oh, you know what, you can tree-stride us
through, and then you guys head up and then we'll

2523
03:14:31,978 --> 03:14:33,879
just meet you up there on the broom.

2524
03:14:33,879 --> 03:14:38,602
MARISHA: That is a good idea. That's what I'll do.
I'll tree-stride some through.

2525
03:14:38,602 --> 03:14:40,224
LAURA: Just me and Percy.

2526
03:14:40,224 --> 03:14:44,672
MATT: All right, easy enough to do. You've seen
these woods, or the perimeter of the woods, at

2527
03:14:44,672 --> 03:14:49,965
least, so you know vaguely a tree in the direction
that Percy points you towards. So with that, you

2528
03:14:49,965 --> 03:14:56,351
touch the edge of the Sun Tree, the exterior of it
opens into a doorway, and through that-- (laughs)

2529
03:14:56,469 --> 03:15:01,814
The trust-fall that is Percival and Vex rushing
through the Sun Tree before it closes behind. You

2530
03:15:01,814 --> 03:15:04,333
trust that they are at the destination required
and will meet you there.

2531
03:15:04,333 --> 03:15:05,650
MARISHA: I'll meet you there!

2532
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:07,090
MATT: It closes.

2533
03:15:07,090 --> 03:15:08,349
TALIESIN: Lock the door!

2534
03:15:08,349 --> 03:15:13,852
MATT: And with that, with the supplies gathered,
the rest of you all have the spell commence, and

2535
03:15:13,924 --> 03:15:18,598
you are able to concentrate for a minute to turn
your physical form into that of a white,

2536
03:15:18,598 --> 03:15:23,815
cloud-like mist. You watch as the gnomes do so,
and this is the first time you're doing this as

2537
03:15:23,815 --> 03:15:29,011
well, Taryon, and it's a unique experience. You're
about as giddy internally that you cannot express

2538
03:15:29,011 --> 03:15:34,418
it through word because you are a cloud of mist.
But you watch as the smaller gnome mists also kind

2539
03:15:34,418 --> 03:15:39,632
of appear and some of them start swirling around
excitedly, and one of them just seems to drift.

2540
03:15:39,632 --> 03:15:41,479
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no. Oh no.

2541
03:15:41,479 --> 03:15:44,268
MATT: One of the other ones comes by and cuts it
off and shows the direction.

2542
03:15:44,268 --> 03:15:46,467
(laughter)

2543
03:15:46,467 --> 03:15:48,909
MATT: Eventually you guys start making your way--

2544
03:15:48,909 --> 03:15:50,154
LAURA: He's sleeping.

2545
03:15:50,154 --> 03:15:52,884
TRAVIS: (snoring)

2546
03:15:52,884 --> 03:16:00,364
MATT: Following towards the path which Percival
pointed you guys. So. This is about a six-plus-hour

2547
03:16:00,364 --> 03:16:06,419
journey as you're coasting over the entirety of
the Parchwood Forest. And it is beautiful, it's

2548
03:16:06,464 --> 03:16:11,076
actually not too cloudy today. You've come past
Winter's Crest, it's been a few weeks since.

2549
03:16:11,076 --> 03:16:12,892
MARISHA: (sings) Butterfly in the sky.

2550
03:16:12,892 --> 03:16:15,518
MARISHA, ASHLEY and MATT: (sing) I can fly twice
as high.

2551
03:16:15,518 --> 03:16:21,684
MATT: Yeah, so you get a few dotted clouds in the
sky, but for the most part there is blue visible

2552
03:16:21,684 --> 03:16:25,823
and there is sunshine coming down, Pelor's
blessing upon the land of the Alabaster Sierras.

2553
03:16:25,823 --> 03:16:31,583
After quite some time, and having to maybe go back
a few times to keep everyone together as you have

2554
03:16:31,583 --> 03:16:36,940
four people who have never done this before who
are just awed by this, you lead them towards the

2555
03:16:36,940 --> 03:16:44,134
northeast very, very top of the Salted Bluffs of
the Alabaster Sierras, and you begin to see what

2556
03:16:44,134 --> 03:16:52,690
Percival described to you, which is a shelf-like
bluff at the very top, where you see a few

2557
03:16:52,690 --> 03:16:59,972
clusters of rock and one large rock archway that
comes up right to the cliff before it drops down

2558
03:16:59,972 --> 03:17:06,442
into the sea to the north. And this is where these
offerings were left. Eventually you guys make your

2559
03:17:06,442 --> 03:17:11,979
way there, and given the speed, you still get
there before Vax and Percy do.

2560
03:17:11,979 --> 03:17:13,000
MARISHA: Really?

2561
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:13,937
MATT: Yes.

2562
03:17:13,937 --> 03:17:15,231
LIAM: Vex and Percy.

2563
03:17:15,231 --> 03:17:21,923
MATT: Sorry. Vex and Percy. Five years of this,
and let this be a lesson for when you name your

2564
03:17:21,923 --> 03:17:31,143
characters for your campaign. As you guys
approach, you all condense back into your mist

2565
03:17:31,143 --> 03:17:37,814
form, except for the four other clouds that are
all circling and circling.

2566
03:17:37,814 --> 03:17:41,770
SAM: They don't know how to break it, do they?
Damn it.

2567
03:17:41,770 --> 03:17:44,632
MATT: Eventually one of them kind of congeals and
turns back and it's JB.

2568
03:17:44,632 --> 03:17:46,415
MARISHA: I would've told them.

2569
03:17:46,415 --> 03:17:53,439
MATT: Well, you do now. And they all eventually
come back. And you see before you, it's this

2570
03:17:53,439 --> 03:18:01,040
clifftop flat entry with a series of rocks that
jut out at certain places and rubble and some

2571
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:04,990
general erosion has occurred, and there at the
very edge of the cliff-- and it is this cliff that

2572
03:18:04,990 --> 03:18:11,957
shoots out over, you can look over the side and
see the sea to the northeast, just above the

2573
03:18:11,957 --> 03:18:20,072
Shearing Cliffs, you see the sunlight hitting
thousands upon thousands of small, distant

2574
03:18:20,072 --> 03:18:24,259
sparkles, as the waves catch elements of the
sunlight down below. And as you come up to the

2575
03:18:24,259 --> 03:18:32,968
edge and look down, it is a very, very long fall.
Thousands and thousands and thousands of feet to

2576
03:18:32,968 --> 03:18:35,515
rocks and ocean.

2577
03:18:35,515 --> 03:18:37,558
LIAM: Right on the edge, looking down.

2578
03:18:37,558 --> 03:18:39,476
MATT: But there's a large stone archway there.

2579
03:18:39,476 --> 03:18:41,024
TRAVIS: Are you wearing your armor?

2580
03:18:41,024 --> 03:18:48,072
LIAM: I am, yeah. We left, we packed up. Some
thoughts I just have inside my head.

2581
03:18:48,072 --> 03:18:50,526
LAURA: Are me and Percy there yet?

2582
03:18:50,526 --> 03:18:56,194
MATT: Not yet, you guys are just making your way
there. You do notice, the rock archway looks both

2583
03:18:56,194 --> 03:18:59,663
ancient and very well-constructed, and it's
impressive that even though the erosion and the

2584
03:18:59,663 --> 03:19:06,658
nature of the strong, cliffside winds that come up
there, it's kept as well as it has. You also see a

2585
03:19:06,658 --> 03:19:16,003
number of long-rotted baskets and sacks and dried,
decomposing fruits and fish bones. You can see

2586
03:19:16,003 --> 03:19:21,614
where basically the remnants of different
offerings were left up here as part of the Pelor

2587
03:19:21,614 --> 03:19:27,839
blessing to the fishermen that walk through the
Salted Bluffs. Eventually, Vex and Percival make

2588
03:19:27,839 --> 03:19:34,182
their way up here as well, and you guys are now,
full journey, about midafternoon, with three days

2589
03:19:34,182 --> 03:19:35,531
until the full moon.

2590
03:19:35,531 --> 03:19:38,018
SAM: Three days to kill.

2591
03:19:38,018 --> 03:19:41,014
LAURA: Hey. That cliff's really high.

2592
03:19:41,014 --> 03:19:46,865
MARISHA: Well, time to pitch a tent and make it
fabulous.

2593
03:19:46,865 --> 03:19:50,916
LAURA: Let's not do the ritual site right next to
that cliff.

2594
03:19:50,916 --> 03:19:56,084
ASHELY: That's a great idea. Is there a way to
move it sort of--

2595
03:19:56,084 --> 03:19:57,808
LAURA: -- inward?

2596
03:19:57,808 --> 03:20:04,970
MATT: You can move back a bit, yeah. The bluff
itself is maybe about 70 feet from one side to the

2597
03:20:04,970 --> 03:20:09,901
other. It's flat. So you can move it further back
towards this edge of the cliff, as opposed to

2598
03:20:09,901 --> 03:20:11,770
being the one that's seaside.

2599
03:20:11,770 --> 03:20:13,163
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah.

2600
03:20:13,163 --> 03:20:22,243
MATT: Okay. So you guys have a few days here to
relax, get to know each other, ask questions and

2601
03:20:22,243 --> 03:20:27,154
hear stories about young Pike, embarrasingly. Get
to tell them of the tales of what you guys have

2602
03:20:27,154 --> 03:20:32,148
done, and inform them from a firsthand basis of
what Vox Machina has accomplished for the past few

2603
03:20:32,148 --> 03:20:39,204
years. They all seem enraptured, JB more than
anybody, and she seems to almost finish some of

2604
03:20:39,204 --> 03:20:42,763
the tales. You get the sense that she's been very,
very well-versed in what you guys have done and is

2605
03:20:42,763 --> 03:20:51,178
genuinely invested in the stories as they happen.
Anything else you guys want to accomplish in the

2606
03:20:51,178 --> 03:20:52,933
three days in particular?

2607
03:20:52,933 --> 03:20:58,466
LIAM: I think the twins will probably look around
and make sure that nobody has been here recently

2608
03:20:58,466 --> 03:21:01,023
other than us, or see if there's anything hinky.

2609
03:21:01,023 --> 03:21:02,474
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2610
03:21:02,474 --> 03:21:10,527
LAURA: Yeah, we do that. Definitely. 23.

2611
03:21:10,527 --> 03:21:11,681
LIAM: Eight.

2612
03:21:11,681 --> 03:21:18,433
MATT: Okay. You do note this in the first couple
days: while it's been long blown-over and

2613
03:21:18,433 --> 03:21:23,790
destroyed and scattered, you do see elements that
seem like a large nest that have been

2614
03:21:23,790 --> 03:21:31,074
wind-scattered up here and left for a long time.
And as you look through the chunks and pieces, you

2615
03:21:31,074 --> 03:21:38,597
see bits of dried leather, flesh, and with that in
mind, over the next two days, you begin to see,

2616
03:21:38,597 --> 03:21:43,967
way off in the north, what appear to be a number
of flying entities that group in clusters that

2617
03:21:43,967 --> 03:21:53,045
kind of exist over the cliffside, down along the
actual mountain edge, and occasionally have

2618
03:21:53,045 --> 03:21:56,202
apparently made distant nests and are still
maneuvering in the distance.

2619
03:21:56,202 --> 03:21:59,280
LAURA: Do I see the type of feather it is? Can I
tell what kind of creature it was?

2620
03:21:59,280 --> 03:22:00,914
MATT: Make a perception check.

2621
03:22:00,914 --> 03:22:08,370
LAURA: 32.

2622
03:22:08,370 --> 03:22:14,026
MATT: Using the combination of your broom and your
ranger-like vision, you've encountered these

2623
03:22:14,026 --> 03:22:18,851
creatures once before, at the Salted Bluff, but
avoided them. There are small clusters of harpies

2624
03:22:18,851 --> 03:22:22,997
that make their home here on the cliffsides by the
ocean.

2625
03:22:22,997 --> 03:22:24,297
LAURA: Yeah, they took all our horses.

2626
03:22:24,297 --> 03:22:29,473
MATT: Yep. They picked them apart last time you
first made your way to Whitestone. So you're very

2627
03:22:29,473 --> 03:22:33,945
careful to make sure that whatever camp you set up
is camouflaged as best as possible. Since that is

2628
03:22:33,945 --> 03:22:36,930
one of your specialties as a ranger, it's not too
bad. Go ahead and make a stealth check, please.

2629
03:22:36,930 --> 03:22:38,744
This will be your stealth check for the camp.

2630
03:22:38,744 --> 03:22:41,614
LAURA: I can't cast Pass Without a Trace?

2631
03:22:41,614 --> 03:22:42,949
MATT: Not on your camp.

2632
03:22:42,949 --> 03:22:44,368
LAURA: No, probably not.

2633
03:22:44,368 --> 03:22:45,358
LIAM: Come on, rogue.

2634
03:22:45,358 --> 03:22:47,097
MATT: I'll say, for the purposes of that, no.

2635
03:22:47,097 --> 03:22:58,607
LAURA: Do I-- (laughs) I'm scared to ask it. Okay.
What am I rolling? What am I adding?

2636
03:22:58,607 --> 03:22:59,807
MATT: Add your stealth.

2637
03:22:59,807 --> 03:23:00,967
LAURA: 22.

2638
03:23:00,967 --> 03:23:04,077
MATT: Okay. So.

2639
03:23:04,077 --> 03:23:15,886
LAURA: But would I have used my-- what is that
shit? Hide in Plain Sight?

2640
03:23:15,886 --> 03:23:17,560
Could I have used that?

2641
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:23,579
MATT: Not on a camp. For yourself, maybe. And it
helps you-- it allows you-- your ability to

2642
03:23:23,579 --> 03:23:29,149
camouflage elements of your space allows you to
help and use your stealth for this whole endeavor.

2643
03:23:29,149 --> 03:23:34,259
But two days go by, harpies don't seem to pay
mind. There's a couple of close calls where a

2644
03:23:34,259 --> 03:23:39,107
couple fly overhead, but you all see them coming
and get low and tell the gnomes to go inside, and

2645
03:23:39,107 --> 03:23:42,715
get behind the rocks, and they seem to pass
without actually noticing your presence.

2646
03:23:42,715 --> 03:23:44,512
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2647
03:23:44,512 --> 03:23:50,483
MATT: Eventually, you make your way to the fourth
day, and the sun begins to set. At which point,

2648
03:23:50,483 --> 03:23:59,954
the gnomes begin to gather up with the rest of
you, and Ogden hobbles his way in your direction,

2649
03:23:59,954 --> 03:24:15,163
going-- waiting for her to cross camera. Okay.
(laughs) "The time is nigh. We must prepare the ritual."

2650
03:24:15,179 --> 03:24:21,464
And, for the purposes of this, can we
bring in the battlemap that is on this side?

2651
03:24:21,543 --> 03:24:26,939
SAM: Battlemap? Just call it a map, Matt, don't
call it a battlemap!

2652
03:24:26,939 --> 03:24:32,659
MATT: This side, please.

2653
03:24:32,659 --> 03:24:37,700
ASHLEY: Battlemap over there? That means there's
another one over there?

2654
03:24:37,700 --> 03:24:39,670
TRAVIS: There are several options, I think.

2655
03:24:39,670 --> 03:24:47,388
LAURA: What? Here it comes. Here comes the
battlemap. Here it comes.

2656
03:24:47,388 --> 03:24:52,610
SAM: Oh my god, what is this? There's color
changes happening.

2657
03:24:52,610 --> 03:24:54,380
LAURA: It's like the birthday cake coming out.

2658
03:24:54,380 --> 03:24:55,798
MATT: This way's great.

2659
03:24:55,798 --> 03:25:01,828
(impressed noises)

2660
03:25:01,828 --> 03:25:04,637
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a lot.

2661
03:25:04,637 --> 03:25:06,784
LIAM: That is extra.

2662
03:25:06,784 --> 03:25:11,240
SAM: It's weird, the blue light makes it almost--
I can't even see what it is.

2663
03:25:11,240 --> 03:25:13,739
MARISHA: It's hard to see with the blue light.

2664
03:25:13,739 --> 03:25:15,626
MATT: Is it really? That's a problem.

2665
03:25:15,626 --> 03:25:17,063
SAM: It's okay, we'll figure it out.

2666
03:25:17,063 --> 03:25:18,788
MARISHA: It could be this monitor. I don't know.

2667
03:25:18,788 --> 03:25:21,792
MATT: All right, so. Here are the gnomes,
clustered.

2668
03:25:21,792 --> 03:25:35,389
SAM: Matt, in preparation for this ritual, I would
like to cast-- can Doty use an item that I cast

2669
03:25:35,389 --> 03:25:36,982
magic into?

2670
03:25:36,982 --> 03:25:41,147
MATT: Doty cannot, I believe.

2671
03:25:41,147 --> 03:25:51,317
SAM: Okay. Well, then I'll cast Revivify into one
of my coins and give it to Vex and say, use this

2672
03:25:51,317 --> 03:26:02,232
on me if I fall. Oh, and also, I'll give her my
five Needle Arrows that I made.

2673
03:26:02,232 --> 03:26:05,684
LAURA: What are these?

2674
03:26:05,684 --> 03:26:09,637
SAM: They're just regular arrows that have a +1 to
hit.

2675
03:26:09,637 --> 03:26:11,070
LAURA: Badass.

2676
03:26:11,070 --> 03:26:13,088
SAM: So just a little extra accuracy.

2677
03:26:13,088 --> 03:26:15,837
LAURA: Tary, you just keep surprising me.

2678
03:26:15,837 --> 03:26:19,048
SAM: You're worth it.

2679
03:26:19,048 --> 03:26:27,023
ASHLEY: With Ogden saying they're ready, can I
just be alone in the tent for a second?

2680
03:26:27,023 --> 03:26:30,959
MATT: Sure. And actually, this is a point as well,
because part of this was supposed to be hallowed

2681
03:26:30,959 --> 03:26:40,995
ground, which requires the Hallow spell, which is
a 24-hour casting period. Or, let me see the

2682
03:26:40,995 --> 03:26:47,402
actual casting time on that. You would know this,
and he would have spoken to you in advance to do

2683
03:26:47,402 --> 03:26:54,503
this, so we'll say, yeah, Hallow, its casting time
is 24 hours. The herbs and oils and incense

2684
03:26:54,503 --> 03:26:58,937
required to do this one alone costs 1,000 gold,
which the spell consumes, so that's 1,000 gold you

2685
03:26:58,937 --> 03:27:00,427
have to mark off to do this.

2686
03:27:00,427 --> 03:27:02,321
LAURA: That's party funds. We got you.

2687
03:27:02,321 --> 03:27:09,225
MATT: But you infuse this area with holy energy
during this time period you guys are waiting. And

2688
03:27:09,225 --> 03:27:14,386
doing so, this whole ground becomes hallowed. Now
you get to choose a second effect of this, if

2689
03:27:14,386 --> 03:27:20,191
you'd like, which is affected creatures can't be
frightened while in the area; darkness fills the

2690
03:27:20,191 --> 03:27:25,389
area, if that's what you want; daylight fills the
area, don't know if that's going to affect the

2691
03:27:25,389 --> 03:27:31,160
ritual or not, seeing as how it's a
moonlight-based element; affected creatures have

2692
03:27:31,160 --> 03:27:36,622
resistance to one type of damage of your choice,
except for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing;

2693
03:27:36,799 --> 03:27:42,576
you can have energy vulnerability; silence. What
would you prefer?

2694
03:27:42,576 --> 03:27:47,766
ASHLEY: I think to not be frightened.

2695
03:27:47,766 --> 03:27:51,754
MATT: Okay. Affected creatures cannot be
frightened. So any of you, and any creatures that

2696
03:27:51,754 --> 03:27:55,967
end up in the space, cannot be frightened. The
60-foot radius, which is pretty much most of this

2697
03:27:55,967 --> 03:28:04,064
area, becomes Hallowed. So. As the night draws to
a darkened close-- or as the day draws to a

2698
03:28:04,064 --> 03:28:07,103
darkened close, you guys can choose your positions
to prepare for this.

2699
03:28:07,103 --> 03:28:08,095
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

2700
03:28:08,095 --> 03:28:12,003
MARISHA: It takes Pike 24 hours to cast this?

2701
03:28:12,003 --> 03:28:12,995
MATT: Yes.

2702
03:28:12,995 --> 03:28:16,800
MARISHA: So we have to protect her for 24 hours,
yeah?

2703
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:21,426
MATT: Yeah, we'll say this happened-- this isn't
the ritual, this is a different spell to prepare

2704
03:28:21,426 --> 03:28:25,868
for the ritual. So while you were doing this was
during the time in which you managed to go ahead

2705
03:28:25,868 --> 03:28:30,132
and avoid being seen and use your stealthiness.
This was in advance of it. The Hallow spell has

2706
03:28:30,132 --> 03:28:35,575
been completed, the area has been locked in. The
spell is cast. Now the final ritual is mounting.

2707
03:28:35,575 --> 03:28:43,919
So. At this point, you're asked for some help by
Ogden to move some of these rocks out of the way.

2708
03:28:43,919 --> 03:28:50,541
You guys slowly shift this pile of rocks over
here. He begins to then, with the help of JB, take

2709
03:28:50,541 --> 03:28:57,023
the sulfur and begin to scatter it around in a
circle in this opening right here. So the other

2710
03:28:57,023 --> 03:28:59,316
two are gonna stay back.

2711
03:28:59,316 --> 03:29:01,862
TALIESIN: I think I'm gonna want some high ground
up on that hill.

2712
03:29:01,862 --> 03:29:08,725
MATT: Up on there? All right, so Percival gets up
onto the high ground there. All righty.

2713
03:29:08,725 --> 03:29:10,622
LAURA: I'll get on the high part on the other
side.

2714
03:29:10,622 --> 03:29:12,985
MATT: Over here? All righty.

2715
03:29:12,985 --> 03:29:14,951
TRAVIS: I would like to stay near Pike if I can.

2716
03:29:14,951 --> 03:29:17,876
MATT: All righty. So you want to stay near this
central rock there?

2717
03:29:17,876 --> 03:29:20,569
TRAVIS: Yeah, as long as I'm out of the way of the
ritual. Just near Pike.

2718
03:29:20,569 --> 03:29:22,039
LAURA: Trinket stays near Grog.

2719
03:29:22,039 --> 03:29:25,529
MATT: Okay, Trinket's gonna hang next to Grog.
Perfect.

2720
03:29:25,529 --> 03:29:34,750
LIAM: I'm gonna play lookout and go out towards
the edge past the arch, but sink in against the

2721
03:29:34,750 --> 03:29:36,298
wall a bit and hide.

2722
03:29:36,298 --> 03:29:37,398
MATT: There a bit, right there?

2723
03:29:37,398 --> 03:29:38,635
LIAM: Into the cracks of it, yeah.

2724
03:29:38,635 --> 03:29:43,399
MATT: Okay. So you're hiding on this side. Poking
through. Keyleth?

2725
03:29:43,399 --> 03:29:47,679
MARISHA: I'll go by that spire closest to you.

2726
03:29:47,679 --> 03:29:50,109
MATT: Over here?

2727
03:29:50,109 --> 03:29:53,069
MARISHA: Yeah, little close to the stalagtite.

2728
03:29:53,069 --> 03:29:54,406
MATT: Over here?

2729
03:29:54,406 --> 03:29:55,449
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you.

2730
03:29:55,449 --> 03:29:58,208
MATT: Okay. There's Keyleth. Taryon?

2731
03:29:58,208 --> 03:30:06,167
SAM: I'm just gonna stay where the gnomes are all
within 30 feet of me. So close to the action.

2732
03:30:06,167 --> 03:30:09,621
MATT: Okay, so pretty much where you are? Okay.

2733
03:30:09,621 --> 03:30:12,455
SAM: Within visual 30 feet.

2734
03:30:12,455 --> 03:30:22,107
MATT: Got you. So Pike, the circle puts you at
about there, in the centerpiece. You watch as the

2735
03:30:22,107 --> 03:30:31,282
sulfur is drawn around you in a wide circle. All
right. JB now begins taking the water and

2736
03:30:31,282 --> 03:30:36,097
splashing it throughout the center of the circle.
She opens the jug with the help of Grog and walks

2737
03:30:36,097 --> 03:30:40,516
around with Grog and is just taking big handfuls
and splashing all the blessed water to fill in the

2738
03:30:40,516 --> 03:30:47,153
circle between-- oh god-- where the sulfur was, in
the interior of it, all around. So it soaks all

2739
03:30:47,153 --> 03:30:51,956
the dirt, you can see it actually goes darker in
color as it absorbs the liquid, and it seems you

2740
03:30:51,956 --> 03:30:56,504
can now very, very clearly see the circle. And at
this point, as the night has really hit the

2741
03:30:56,504 --> 03:31:01,576
moonlight, the full moon is plainly visible, and
that bright, bright white moonlight is making

2742
03:31:01,576 --> 03:31:09,625
stark shadows and a very visible perspective of
everything on this field. So, Pike, you're asked

2743
03:31:09,625 --> 03:31:16,564
to stand in the center there, as right over here
next to Taryon, facing you, Ogden hobbles over,

2744
03:31:16,751 --> 03:31:36,449
looks at you. He holds the diamond in his hand.
"Pike. Are you ready?"

2745
03:31:36,449 --> 03:31:55,952
ASHLEY: Two seconds. Just quietly, just sort of
muttering to myself, or not to myself, to

2746
03:31:55,952 --> 03:32:10,219
Sarenrae, I don't know what this is, I just hope
that you're here and watching, and please be by my

2747
03:32:10,219 --> 03:32:20,622
side and guide this ritual if it is your will.
Okay. I'm ready.

2748
03:32:20,622 --> 03:32:30,465
MATT: Okay. Ogden is holding the diamond out.
"Close your eyes. Concentrate on the goodness

2749
03:32:30,465 --> 03:32:37,961
"within you." He holds the diamond out in front of
him and just starts chanting

2750
03:32:37,961 --> 03:32:39,079
slowly under his breath.

2751
03:32:39,079 --> 03:32:42,457
SAM: Okay. I'm gonna drink the Potion of Mind
Reading.

2752
03:32:42,496 --> 03:32:44,808
MATT: Okay, you drink the Potion of Mind Reading.

2753
03:32:44,808 --> 03:32:45,838
SAM: Yes.

2754
03:32:45,838 --> 03:32:50,023
MATT: Okay. He's loudly--

2755
03:32:50,023 --> 03:32:51,777
LAURA: What if he's stealing her soul?

2756
03:32:51,777 --> 03:32:57,020
MATT: He's holding this diamond forward and he's
loudly speaking in a language I don't think any of

2757
03:32:57,020 --> 03:33:02,251
you understand. (mutters gibberish)

2758
03:33:02,251 --> 03:33:08,548
SAM: I'm going to scan his surface thoughts, what
is most on his mind in that moment.

2759
03:33:08,548 --> 03:33:17,379
MATT: Currently, at that moment, it sounds like a
bunch of gibberish. (mutters gibberish)

2760
03:33:17,379 --> 03:33:20,713
LAURA: What is he speaking?

2761
03:33:20,713 --> 03:33:28,137
SAM: As an action, if it's my turn again, I will
attempt to probe deeper into

2762
03:33:28,137 --> 03:33:29,773
the same creature's mind.

2763
03:33:29,773 --> 03:33:30,974
MATT: Okay.

2764
03:33:30,974 --> 03:33:32,597
SAM: He makes a wisdom saving throw.

2765
03:33:32,597 --> 03:33:33,947
MATT: Against a DC of?

2766
03:33:33,947 --> 03:33:36,755
SAM: 13. It's not very good.

2767
03:33:36,755 --> 03:33:43,023
MATT: Okay. As you focus your attention, pushing
in to probe deeper, all you get is the gibberish.

2768
03:33:43,023 --> 03:33:44,577
SAM: More gibberish.

2769
03:33:44,577 --> 03:33:46,934
MATT: Natural 17, sorry.

2770
03:33:46,934 --> 03:33:50,376
SAM: Ugh! Waste of 1,000 bucks.

2771
03:33:50,376 --> 03:33:54,659
LAURA: You can't try the other gnomes?

2772
03:33:54,659 --> 03:33:59,310
SAM: I believe that breaks the spell.

2773
03:33:59,310 --> 03:34:01,486
MATT: Is that what it says?

2774
03:34:01,486 --> 03:34:13,187
SAM: It says if I probe deeper, he makes a wisdom
saving throw. If he succeeds, the spell ends. And!

2775
03:34:13,187 --> 03:34:15,871
He's aware I was probing.

2776
03:34:15,871 --> 03:34:27,577
MATT: As he's chanting. (mutters gibberish,
pauses, continues to mutter gibberish) Goes right

2777
03:34:27,577 --> 03:34:29,504
back into concentrating again.

2778
03:34:29,504 --> 03:34:31,492
SAM: The plan failed! The plan failed!

2779
03:34:31,492 --> 03:34:35,238
MATT: What languages do you know?

2780
03:34:35,238 --> 03:34:43,604
SAM: I know Sylvan, Common, Gnome, Draconic,
Undercommon.

2781
03:34:43,604 --> 03:34:44,884
MATT: Languages?

2782
03:34:44,884 --> 03:34:47,021
TALIESIN: Common, Celestial, Elven.

2783
03:34:47,021 --> 03:34:52,717
MARISHA: Common, Elven, Celestial-- sorry, Sylvan,
Druidic, Primordial.

2784
03:34:52,717 --> 03:34:55,220
LIAM: Common, Elven, and Abyssal.

2785
03:34:55,220 --> 03:34:59,167
LAURA: Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal, and
Draconic.

2786
03:34:59,167 --> 03:35:03,702
ASHLEY: Gnomish, Common, Undercommon, Dwarvish.

2787
03:35:03,702 --> 03:35:05,414
TRAVIS: Come on.

2788
03:35:05,414 --> 03:35:07,418
(laughter)

2789
03:35:07,418 --> 03:35:08,731
MATT: Barely Common.

2790
03:35:08,731 --> 03:35:11,533
TRAVIS: I just have spoken Giant, that's it.

2791
03:35:11,533 --> 03:35:16,030
MATT: Okay. None of you know the language he's
speaking. It just sounds like gibberish to you.

2792
03:35:16,030 --> 03:35:21,981
Oh, and Dwarvish, because you have the belt. As he
begins chanting, the diamond begins to glow

2793
03:35:21,981 --> 03:35:30,729
faintly, a greenish color. Just very, very, on the
inside, just ever-so-gently. He begins to chant

2794
03:35:30,729 --> 03:35:41,452
louder and louder. (louder gibberish) As he does,
the diamond flashes brighter and brighter green,

2795
03:35:41,452 --> 03:35:50,187
and eventually the green coloration fades and the
diamond vanishes from his hand.

2796
03:35:50,187 --> 03:35:51,734
SAM: Another thousand!

2797
03:35:51,734 --> 03:36:04,739
MATT: And he falls to his knees. (heavy breathing)
"Look!" And as he points forward, towards Pike,

2798
03:36:04,739 --> 03:36:09,432
you guys glance over and look at Pike, and you
watch as from the ground around her, this black

2799
03:36:09,432 --> 03:36:19,386
cloud-like mass begins to pour out of her legs and
knees in a swirl around her person. You, Pike,

2800
03:36:19,386 --> 03:36:25,189
look around you as it begins to fill the space
around you and it begins to coalesce into this

2801
03:36:25,189 --> 03:36:32,109
large cloud of darkness. It rumbles and gathers
like a miniature thunderstorm, and you watch as

2802
03:36:32,109 --> 03:36:35,477
the clouds begin to churn, forming dozens of
screaming faces,

2803
03:36:35,477 --> 03:36:46,524
all wailing in a discordant moan.

2804
03:36:46,524 --> 03:36:49,524
SAM: That don't look good. That's tall.

2805
03:36:49,524 --> 03:36:50,566
MATT: Roll initative.

2806
03:36:50,566 --> 03:36:52,809
(yelling)

2807
03:36:52,809 --> 03:36:56,154
LAURA: Oh my god, I totally thought he was gonna
steal your soul and stick you in that diamond, I

2808
03:36:56,154 --> 03:36:59,124
was like, this was a bad idea.

2809
03:36:59,124 --> 03:37:11,027
MATT: All righty. Who's at the top? We've got 25
to 20.

2810
03:37:11,027 --> 03:37:12,040
LIAM: 21.

2811
03:37:12,040 --> 03:37:12,936
TALIESIN: 22.

2812
03:37:12,936 --> 03:37:13,973
TRAVIS: 20.

2813
03:37:13,973 --> 03:37:19,121
ASHLEY: This music.

2814
03:37:19,121 --> 03:37:23,728
MATT: All righty. 20 to 15.

2815
03:37:23,728 --> 03:37:24,649
LAURA: 18.

2816
03:37:24,649 --> 03:37:25,784
MATT: 18.

2817
03:37:25,784 --> 03:37:27,708
MARISHA: 15.

2818
03:37:27,708 --> 03:37:28,925
MATT: 15, Keyleth.

2819
03:37:28,925 --> 03:37:31,967
SAM: My plan was foolproof.

2820
03:37:31,967 --> 03:37:33,422
MATT: 15 to ten?

2821
03:37:33,422 --> 03:37:36,959
LAURA: You really should've tried that when he was
speaking English.

2822
03:37:36,959 --> 03:37:38,418
MATT: Ten to five?

2823
03:37:38,418 --> 03:37:39,735
LAURA: Common.

2824
03:37:39,735 --> 03:37:42,596
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, eight. Sorry.

2825
03:37:42,596 --> 03:37:45,613
ASHLEY: Pike fashion.

2826
03:37:45,613 --> 03:37:46,915
MATT: Tary, what'd you get?

2827
03:37:46,915 --> 03:37:48,325
SAM: Three.

2828
03:37:48,325 --> 03:37:50,223
TRAVIS: (laughs) That happens a lot for you.

2829
03:37:50,223 --> 03:37:52,665
LIAM: If it makes you feel better, I rolled a one
and used Luck.

2830
03:37:52,665 --> 03:37:54,283
SAM: And then got?

2831
03:37:54,283 --> 03:37:55,699
LIAM: 21.

2832
03:37:55,699 --> 03:37:57,098
SAM: Oh, jesus.

2833
03:37:57,098 --> 03:37:59,071
MATT: Percival, you're up first.

2834
03:37:59,071 --> 03:38:12,921
TALIESIN: Just 'cause this thing's weird, first
thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to hit it with a

2835
03:38:12,921 --> 03:38:25,631
Sharpshooter with-- where's my runs? With a
Deadeye. So I'm getting advantage on it and

2836
03:38:25,631 --> 03:38:30,324
hitting with Sharpshooter. And let's see what
happens.

2837
03:38:30,324 --> 03:38:31,417
SAM: What if it's good?

2838
03:38:31,417 --> 03:38:32,375
TALIESIN: With Animus.

2839
03:38:32,375 --> 03:38:34,518
SAM: You don't even know if it's a good guy.

2840
03:38:34,518 --> 03:38:37,115
TRAVIS: Is it surrounding Pike or is it just next
to Pike?

2841
03:38:37,115 --> 03:38:41,134
MATT: It's pseudo-surrounding her and right behind
her, like it's kind of forming behind her and

2842
03:38:41,134 --> 03:38:42,682
adjacent to her body.

2843
03:38:42,682 --> 03:38:44,085
TRAVIS: What did you do?

2844
03:38:44,085 --> 03:38:47,962
TALIESIN: That's, yeah, 30 to hit.

2845
03:38:47,962 --> 03:38:49,781
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

2846
03:38:49,781 --> 03:39:01,633
TALIESIN: That's-- my brain is made of swiss
cheese. Here we go. 1d10 plus 1d6, so that's--

2847
03:39:01,633 --> 03:39:12,702
yeah, that's nice. So that's, oh yeah, that's
really good. 26 points of damage, plus six points

2848
03:39:12,702 --> 03:39:19,686
of psychic damage, and just because I'm irritated
by this thing, I'm gonna drop some Cabal's Ruin

2849
03:39:19,686 --> 03:39:25,783
into it. Let's just drop-- where's my pen? Here's
my pen.

2850
03:39:25,783 --> 03:39:28,070
SAM: Where's my pen?

2851
03:39:28,070 --> 03:39:30,288
SAM and MATT: They took my pen!

2852
03:39:30,288 --> 03:39:33,461
TALIESIN: Let's drop five points of Cabal's Ruin
into that. That's 5d6, if I recall?

2853
03:39:33,461 --> 03:39:37,391
MATT: 5d6 of Kids in the Hall damage, got it.
(laughs)

2854
03:39:37,391 --> 03:39:46,860
TALIESIN: So that's, ugh, three, four, five. Ten
points of lightning damage.

2855
03:39:46,860 --> 03:39:51,876
MATT: Got you. So as you fire-- this is with Bad
News, or with your--

2856
03:39:51,876 --> 03:39:53,250
TALIESIN: This is Animus.

2857
03:39:53,250 --> 03:39:57,480
MATT: This is Animus, okay. So as you fire and
turn it over, you look down and watch as the

2858
03:39:57,480 --> 03:40:03,537
bullet just seems to pass through it, and then
almost catch the edge of the rock here and

2859
03:40:03,537 --> 03:40:07,691
splinter off, and doesn't seem to affect it
directly at all.

2860
03:40:07,691 --> 03:40:11,176
TALIESIN: The lightning and the psychic didn't do
anything?

2861
03:40:11,176 --> 03:40:15,230
MATT: Nope. You watch as the energy kind of
crackles and dissipates amongst the rock.

2862
03:40:15,230 --> 03:40:17,190
SAM: Wait, no damage, it took?

2863
03:40:17,190 --> 03:40:20,796
LIAM: Best you can tell.

2864
03:40:20,796 --> 03:40:22,428
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem to have affected it.

2865
03:40:22,428 --> 03:40:24,169
SAM: Oh shit.

2866
03:40:24,169 --> 03:40:32,689
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- I don't know what to do.

2867
03:40:32,689 --> 03:40:35,084
MARISHA: You just shot at it, you didn't do
anything?

2868
03:40:35,084 --> 03:40:43,910
TALIESIN: I just shot at it. I'm going to attempt
to Hex it with a bonus action. Does it catch?

2869
03:40:43,910 --> 03:40:53,420
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and attempt to Hex it. As
you focus on it, nothing seems to hit.

2870
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:56,523
MARISHA: Including a Hex?

2871
03:40:56,523 --> 03:41:01,413
MATT: The Hex has no effect, and you don't sense
any connection with this creature, you don't see

2872
03:41:01,413 --> 03:41:05,129
any of the smoke or shadow surrounding it. The Hex
has no effect.

2873
03:41:05,129 --> 03:41:06,222
SAM: Maybe it's not there.

2874
03:41:06,222 --> 03:41:15,001
TALIESIN: Maybe it's an illusion. I'm going to--
since I don't have much left, I burnt a little

2875
03:41:15,001 --> 03:41:19,733
bit, I'm just I'm going to reload, hunker down,
and watch what happens. I'm also going to watch

2876
03:41:19,733 --> 03:41:23,796
the gnomes, all of them. Are any of them doing
weird shit? That's where I'm gonna use the rest of

2877
03:41:23,855 --> 03:41:27,047
my turn, to just look at the gnomes and see what
they're doing.

2878
03:41:27,047 --> 03:41:33,656
MATT: Okay. Right now, the two other gnomes are
just waiting off to the side, watching aghast, and

2879
03:41:33,656 --> 03:41:40,263
you watch as Ogden is slowly, with his staff,
backing up, hand out, looking freaked out, backing

2880
03:41:40,263 --> 03:41:49,333
into Taryon. Look over and noticing his presence,
and then focusing back on the horrible thing

2881
03:41:49,333 --> 03:41:53,517
that's surrounding Pike right now, and he looks
genuinely frightened. Is that your turn?

2882
03:41:53,517 --> 03:41:54,707
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

2883
03:41:54,707 --> 03:41:56,576
MATT: Okay. Percival's done. Vax, you're up.

2884
03:41:56,576 --> 03:42:00,382
LIAM: Before I decide, what is the thing doing to
Pike? What am I looking at?

2885
03:42:00,382 --> 03:42:05,810
MATT: It hasn't had its turn yet. You're watching
this 12-foot-tall swirling, almost slow-moving

2886
03:42:05,810 --> 03:42:13,519
tornado of black cloud and smoke that is starting
to form all these horrible faces, forming this

2887
03:42:13,519 --> 03:42:16,459
cacophony of sounds and screaming and moaning.

2888
03:42:16,459 --> 03:42:25,083
LIAM: Okay. I'm gonna click the Boots of Haste.
I'm going to flip out the wings. And then I'm

2889
03:42:25,083 --> 03:42:32,120
going to fly-- not through, because I don't wanna
go by the thing, but around towards Keyleth and

2890
03:42:32,120 --> 03:42:37,124
around towards Pike and grab Pike and fly her up
next to Percival.

2891
03:42:37,124 --> 03:42:45,882
MATT: Fly her up next to Percival? Okay. So you
try and pick her up. Make a strength check, 'cause

2892
03:42:45,882 --> 03:42:48,544
she is a very heavily armored tiny little--

2893
03:42:48,544 --> 03:42:49,550
ASHLEY: Tank?

2894
03:42:49,550 --> 03:42:50,817
MATT: Tank of a gnome.

2895
03:42:50,817 --> 03:42:53,565
LAURA: Strength check.

2896
03:42:53,565 --> 03:42:55,417
LIAM: I don't make those. 17.

2897
03:42:55,417 --> 03:43:02,651
MATT: 17. You do, and it slows your movement to half
when you're carrying her, but you manage to pick

2898
03:43:02,727 --> 03:43:08,653
her up. As you do so, you watch as the form sends
this pseudopod of a screaming face and arm

2899
03:43:08,653 --> 03:43:13,153
swinging out towards you. That is a 17.

2900
03:43:13,153 --> 03:43:14,313
LIAM: No.

2901
03:43:14,313 --> 03:43:20,342
MATT: You just pull her out of reach as it swings
out in your direction. For the rest of your

2902
03:43:20,342 --> 03:43:23,654
movement, you pull her just up to the edge of the
rock, there, and you can set her down if you want.

2903
03:43:23,654 --> 03:43:29,690
Oh god! Is that your turn?

2904
03:43:29,690 --> 03:43:31,572
LIAM: Yeah, that's the end.

2905
03:43:31,572 --> 03:43:33,788
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog.

2906
03:43:33,788 --> 03:43:40,858
TRAVIS: Gonna find out what this thing is, get up
close and personal. I would like to Rage. Just

2907
03:43:40,858 --> 03:43:44,176
charge right at the thing that was towering over
my buddy Pike.

2908
03:43:44,176 --> 03:43:47,413
MATT: Right there. You come up right to the side
of it, and you can look up and see it now. It's

2909
03:43:47,413 --> 03:43:52,860
forming this wall of screaming faces at you, and a
lot of them are watching as-- all of them are

2910
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:57,401
facing Pike as she disappears, and all of a
sudden, all at once, a hundred faces go (shhhp) to

2911
03:43:57,401 --> 03:44:02,051
you, and (gurgling growl). What are you doing?

2912
03:44:02,051 --> 03:44:08,410
TRAVIS: All eyes on me. I swing at it. The first
one regular.

2913
03:44:08,410 --> 03:44:09,562
MATT: Okay.

2914
03:44:09,562 --> 03:44:13,232
TRAVIS: 28.

2915
03:44:13,232 --> 03:44:15,258
MATT: 28 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2916
03:44:15,258 --> 03:44:22,109
TRAVIS: We'll see what happens now. 24 points of
damage.

2917
03:44:22,109 --> 03:44:27,310
MATT: 24 points of damage. As you rush up angrily,
you swing your axe, with additional?

2918
03:44:27,310 --> 03:44:28,671
TRAVIS: Necrotic, four.

2919
03:44:28,671 --> 03:44:34,323
MATT: All right, 28. All right, cool. You swing,
and as your axe cleaves through the side of it,

2920
03:44:34,323 --> 03:44:39,225
you watch as parts of it break open, sending
chunks of it flying, and the creature (shrieks)

2921
03:44:39,225 --> 03:44:41,594
seems to scream in pain from the impact.

2922
03:44:41,594 --> 03:44:45,725
TRAVIS: Nice. It screamed in pain from the
impact.

2923
03:44:45,725 --> 03:44:47,060
LAURA: Okay.

2924
03:44:47,060 --> 03:44:56,555
TRAVIS: So the second one, can I make it-- we
don't know how high this thing is. Can I do a

2925
03:44:56,555 --> 03:44:58,507
Great Weapon Master for the second one?

2926
03:44:58,507 --> 03:44:59,577
MATT: Sure.

2927
03:44:59,577 --> 03:45:08,775
TRAVIS: Okay. Minus five. That's gonna miss.
That's 18.

2928
03:45:08,775 --> 03:45:11,293
MATT: 18. You hit, go ahead and roll damage.

2929
03:45:11,293 --> 03:45:22,874
TRAVIS: Oh, really? 18 hit? Okay. Shit. 36. 36
points of damage.

2930
03:45:22,874 --> 03:45:24,735
LAURA: Did you add your necrotic?

2931
03:45:24,735 --> 03:45:30,251
TRAVIS: Nope. Sorry, I haven't used the blood axe
in a while. 39 points of damage. Three points of

2932
03:45:30,251 --> 03:45:31,340
necrotic.

2933
03:45:31,340 --> 03:45:33,088
MATT: That Great Weapon Master, man.

2934
03:45:33,088 --> 03:45:37,252
TRAVIS: I know. That's why I wanted the blood axe
back. Missed it.

2935
03:45:37,252 --> 03:45:42,632
MATT: You swing with the second strike. This time,
you watch as some of the faces implode at the

2936
03:45:42,632 --> 03:45:48,732
impact, and you see a flash of dark matter just
get strung out about three or four feet from it as

2937
03:45:48,732 --> 03:45:52,747
you strike through, and it (shrieks) gives a
horrible scream in pain as it does so.

2938
03:45:52,747 --> 03:45:54,906
TRAVIS: Okay, that's it. No bonus action.

2939
03:45:54,906 --> 03:45:57,897
MATT: You're not going Frenzied?

2940
03:45:57,897 --> 03:45:58,660
TRAVIS: No.

2941
03:45:58,660 --> 03:46:06,553
MATT: Okay, that ends Grog's turn. It is now the
creature's turn. It's going to move, moving

2942
03:46:06,553 --> 03:46:13,706
upwards and trying to catch up to Pike. But,
because of the nature of the Hallowed ground, it

2943
03:46:13,706 --> 03:46:16,574
gets that far and then stops and is held in
place.

2944
03:46:16,574 --> 03:46:21,321
TRAVIS: Do I get an opportunity?

2945
03:46:21,321 --> 03:46:23,231
MATT: You do. Go ahead and roll an attack.

2946
03:46:23,231 --> 03:46:24,742
TRAVIS: Can I make it Reckless?

2947
03:46:24,742 --> 03:46:27,870
MATT: Mm-hm. Actually, I think Reckless has to be
on the first attack of your round.

2948
03:46:27,870 --> 03:46:35,162
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fair enough. Shit, I picked
it up. I think it was a seven. So 23.

2949
03:46:35,162 --> 03:46:36,298
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

2950
03:46:36,298 --> 03:46:41,859
TRAVIS: Okay. That's a 12 again. 26.

2951
03:46:41,859 --> 03:46:48,370
MATT: 26. All right. With it being downed by that
movement, it moves in and makes its way towards

2952
03:46:48,370 --> 03:46:57,976
Ogden. Ogden, who is backed up against you at this
point, Taryon, you watch as the spectacles-- you

2953
03:46:57,976 --> 03:47:03,471
push him forward? (yelps) As it swings forward,
and you see two of the mouths reach out to attempt

2954
03:47:03,471 --> 03:47:14,163
to-- that's a three. (laughs) Both snap, and the
old gnome would've been bit, except you pushed him

2955
03:47:14,163 --> 03:47:20,251
forward, and he kind of like catches himself, and
both of them miss him by but an inch, and he turns

2956
03:47:20,251 --> 03:47:25,255
around, glancing at it, still has his hand forward
like, "No!" as he's clutching his staff at his

2957
03:47:25,255 --> 03:47:29,840
side to keep his standing. That finishes the
creature's turn. Vex, you're up.

2958
03:47:29,840 --> 03:47:36,144
LAURA: Okay. I-- what is JB doing?

2959
03:47:36,144 --> 03:47:43,181
MATT: JB is over here by Trinket, and is currently
seeing this whole thing occur, and is about to go

2960
03:47:43,181 --> 03:47:46,217
ahead-- it's not her turn yet, but she's going to
probably-- looks like she's heading that direction

2961
03:47:46,217 --> 03:47:47,884
to dart behind the rock.

2962
03:47:47,890 --> 03:47:52,049
LAURA: Okay. Trinket's gonna go run at-- I'm gonna
Hunter's Mark it if I can.

2963
03:47:52,049 --> 03:47:56,884
MATT: As you concentrate, Hunter's Mark finds no
purchase on the creature.

2964
03:47:56,884 --> 03:48:09,776
LAURA: Fucker. All right, Trinket runs up. I have
a feeling this is-- and he is going to-- I don't

2965
03:48:09,776 --> 03:48:14,477
know, do I get one attack and Trinket gets one
attack? Is that how it can work? Or he only gets a

2966
03:48:14,477 --> 03:48:16,642
bonus attack if I take an attack.

2967
03:48:16,642 --> 03:48:19,929
MATT: You either give Trinket the full round of
attacks, and then you get one attack as a bonus

2968
03:48:19,929 --> 03:48:23,571
action, or you get two attacks and then Trinket
gets a bonus action attack.

2969
03:48:23,571 --> 03:48:25,803
LAURA: Okay. And I already tried to Hunter's Mark
him.

2970
03:48:25,803 --> 03:48:27,382
MATT: You did, as a bonus action.

2971
03:48:27,382 --> 03:48:31,479
LAURA: So I'm gonna have Trinket attack him down
there.

2972
03:48:31,479 --> 03:48:34,056
MATT: Okay, so two attacks from Trinket. Go for
it.

2973
03:48:34,056 --> 03:48:37,176
TRAVIS: C'mon, Trink.

2974
03:48:37,176 --> 03:48:47,797
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, one is a 25, and the
other one is a 19.

2975
03:48:47,797 --> 03:48:49,752
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2976
03:48:49,752 --> 03:48:57,852
LAURA: Oh, that's not as very good. Nine for his
bite.

2977
03:48:57,852 --> 03:48:59,071
MATT: Nice.

2978
03:48:59,071 --> 03:49:10,556
LAURA: And then his claw-- oh, come on, Trinket.
12 for-- no, 11 for his claws.

2979
03:49:10,556 --> 03:49:16,348
MATT: 20 points of damage from Trinket, not bad.
Trinket rushes out and bites into the smoky faces

2980
03:49:16,348 --> 03:49:20,279
and pulls back, and you watch as some of the
shadow gets yanked with the teeth and then

2981
03:49:20,279 --> 03:49:26,156
disperses and then vanishes in the air. And then
turns around, big raking claw, and part of its

2982
03:49:26,156 --> 03:49:29,178
midsection shifts with the impact and has to
reform.

2983
03:49:29,178 --> 03:49:31,054
TRAVIS: (whispers) What is this thing?

2984
03:49:31,054 --> 03:49:32,494
MATT: You gonna stay where you are?

2985
03:49:32,494 --> 03:49:38,552
LAURA: I'm gonna stay where I am, and I wanna keep
eyes on-- ooh, I wonder if you have to be in the

2986
03:49:38,552 --> 03:49:42,314
circle to do damage. Fuck.

2987
03:49:42,314 --> 03:49:45,656
MARISHA: Was Percy not in the circle before?

2988
03:49:45,656 --> 03:49:46,604
LAURA: No.

2989
03:49:46,604 --> 03:49:47,846
MARISHA: That's interesting.

2990
03:49:47,846 --> 03:49:50,602
SAM: But Groggy-poo was.

2991
03:49:50,602 --> 03:49:52,394
MARISHA: And Trinket was.

2992
03:49:52,394 --> 03:49:58,182
LAURA: I'm gonna stay out. I'm gonna keep eyes on
JB to see what she's doing.

2993
03:49:58,182 --> 03:50:00,042
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn?

2994
03:50:00,042 --> 03:50:01,876
LAURA: Yeah.

2995
03:50:01,876 --> 03:50:05,601
MATT: All righty. Keyleth, you're up.

2996
03:50:05,601 --> 03:50:09,281
MARISHA: Am I in the circle of what I know--
Pike?

2997
03:50:09,281 --> 03:50:13,306
MATT: You are-- you have to move five feet further
in to be within the sulfur and water line.

2998
03:50:13,306 --> 03:50:18,946
MARISHA: Okay, hearing Vex figure this out, I'm
gonna step forward just a little bit into the

2999
03:50:18,946 --> 03:50:26,296
sulfur line, and then I'm gonna cast Moonbeam
right overtop of him at fourth level.

3000
03:50:26,296 --> 03:50:27,986
MATT: Okay.

3001
03:50:27,986 --> 03:50:34,209
MARISHA: And see what happens. Moonbeam. So a
shapechanger makes its saving throw with

3002
03:50:34,209 --> 03:50:40,872
disadvantage, and if it fails, it instantly
reverts to its original form. If it's a

3003
03:50:40,872 --> 03:50:43,755
shapechanger. But I don't really know, I'm just
guessing.

3004
03:50:43,755 --> 03:50:49,050
MATT: Okay. Five-foot radius. Yeah, so you can--
it basically encompasses the whole size of the

3005
03:50:49,050 --> 03:50:55,738
creature. So you watch as, in the middle of the
sky, the full moon that's partially almost at its

3006
03:50:55,738 --> 03:51:00,057
zenith, you watch as almost a secondary moon
appears next to it for a moment, and a single

3007
03:51:00,057 --> 03:51:03,288
column of bright moonlight hits the ground.

3008
03:51:03,288 --> 03:51:05,351
MARISHA: Kinda harnessing the moon, you know?

3009
03:51:05,351 --> 03:51:06,263
MATT: Yeah.

3010
03:51:06,263 --> 03:51:07,700
MARISHA: Yeah, moon goddess shit? Yeah.

3011
03:51:07,700 --> 03:51:10,624
MATT: And it's illuminating the creature from the
inside, and where the smoke is, you can now see

3012
03:51:10,624 --> 03:51:15,114
there are portions of it that are burning on the
inside, like there's small holes being dug through

3013
03:51:15,114 --> 03:51:20,576
it as the beam continues to focus on it. Are you
gonna-- you can still move the rest of your

3014
03:51:20,576 --> 03:51:22,421
movement, or you can stay where you are.

3015
03:51:22,421 --> 03:51:29,475
MARISHA: I'll kind of shift towards the front of
the column, so I have the column behind my back.

3016
03:51:29,475 --> 03:51:30,942
MATT: Right there?

3017
03:51:30,942 --> 03:51:31,884
MARISHA: Yeah.

3018
03:51:31,884 --> 03:51:35,996
MATT: Okay. You leap over some of the leftover
sacks and offerings there and put your back

3019
03:51:35,996 --> 03:51:46,083
against the column. All right, perfect. That
brings us to the gnomes' turns. These guys, you

3020
03:51:46,083 --> 03:51:53,593
watch as Johann and Astra just move behind the
side of the rock. They're too entranced to look

3021
03:51:53,593 --> 03:52:01,983
away, but you guys seem to have this handled, so
they're watching from the side. You watch as Ogden

3022
03:52:01,983 --> 03:52:09,662
begins to-- oh god!-- he hobbles back behind you,
Taryon, and goes like, "Excuse me!" and pushes

3023
03:52:09,662 --> 03:52:11,935
alongside you to move behind the rock here.

3024
03:52:11,935 --> 03:52:13,790
SAM: I get an attack of opportunity.

3025
03:52:13,790 --> 03:52:16,222
(laughter)

3026
03:52:16,222 --> 03:52:23,717
MATT: The creature does, though. And (whoosh) just
misses over the top of his head. The gnome's size

3027
03:52:23,717 --> 03:52:29,118
is too small, and it keeps missing him by about a
foot. And he backs up, going, (heavy breathing),

3028
03:52:29,118 --> 03:52:36,293
holding onto his staff. That ends his turn, and
you watch as JB rushes over behind this rock here

3029
03:52:36,293 --> 03:52:43,622
and starts shouting up, "Ogden, are you okay?"
That's going to end her turn. Pike, you're up.

3030
03:52:43,622 --> 03:52:53,825
ASHLEY: Okay. Am I able to get back into the
circle? How far am I?

3031
03:52:53,825 --> 03:52:58,662
MATT: You can, yes.

3032
03:52:58,662 --> 03:52:59,981
ASHLEY: All right.

3033
03:52:59,981 --> 03:53:04,321
MATT: I'll ask you to make an acrobatics check,
'cause you're having to leap down from these large

3034
03:53:04,321 --> 03:53:05,967
five-foot stone drops.

3035
03:53:05,967 --> 03:53:17,897
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Gil. Don't fuck
me, Gil. You fucked me, Gil. Four.

3036
03:53:17,897 --> 03:53:19,809
LAURA: Oh no.

3037
03:53:19,809 --> 03:53:24,993
MATT: So you leap down this one. As you leap down
to there, as you hit the ground, it's just too

3038
03:53:24,993 --> 03:53:30,306
much height with all the heavy armor and all the
chaos going on, that when your foot hits, the rock

3039
03:53:30,306 --> 03:53:35,713
sprains your ankle, for a second it kind of folds
to the side, and you fall down to one knee. I'll

3040
03:53:35,713 --> 03:53:43,828
say with that, your movement's going to get you
right there. You're not in the circle currently.

3041
03:53:43,828 --> 03:53:58,695
ASHLEY: All right. Then I will cast Spirit
Guardians into the circle.

3042
03:53:58,695 --> 03:53:59,933
MATT: Okay.

3043
03:53:59,933 --> 03:54:04,494
ASHLEY: And I will have them attack.

3044
03:54:04,494 --> 03:54:08,596
MATT: Okay. Spirit Guardians here.

3045
03:54:08,596 --> 03:54:11,817
TRAVIS: I don't think we've seen that before.

3046
03:54:11,817 --> 03:54:14,673
LAURA: I know, right? I think she's done Spirit
Guardians one other time.

3047
03:54:14,673 --> 03:54:16,985
TRAVIS: Okay. Sorry.

3048
03:54:16,985 --> 03:54:18,426
ASHLEY: It's okay.

3049
03:54:18,426 --> 03:54:24,235
MATT: So you're designating them as the creature,
their speed is halved. When the creature enters

3050
03:54:24,235 --> 03:54:28,737
the area or starts its turn there, it has to make
a wisdom save or take the damage, right? That's

3051
03:54:28,737 --> 03:54:34,637
how it works. Okay. So. That ends your turn, Pike,
as you cast the spell. There you watch as a series

3052
03:54:34,637 --> 03:54:44,558
of small, ghostly divine-focused creatures appear
on the horizon of the circle, all looming towards

3053
03:54:44,558 --> 03:54:47,949
this dark entity. That ends your turn, Pike?

3054
03:54:47,949 --> 03:54:49,376
ASHLEY: Yes.

3055
03:54:49,376 --> 03:54:50,852
MATT: All righty. Taryon.

3056
03:54:50,852 --> 03:55:06,759
SAM: Oh god. All right. I whip out my String of
Beads and I pull off a bead and I will throw it

3057
03:55:06,759 --> 03:55:14,228
down at the creature's feet, just behind it if
possible, so it and only it is

3058
03:55:14,228 --> 03:55:15,992
in the cube of ten feet.

3059
03:55:15,992 --> 03:55:19,037
MATT: Okay. Let me see here.

3060
03:55:19,037 --> 03:55:24,810
LIAM: (whispers) Where does he get all these
wonderful toys?

3061
03:55:24,810 --> 03:55:28,884
SAM: Money! Lots and lots of money.

3062
03:55:28,884 --> 03:55:41,044
MATT: Okay. The bead hits the ground and
detonates, and you watch as there's a flash of

3063
03:55:41,044 --> 03:55:48,045
arcane energy in the sphere. As it encompasses, it
doesn't seem to affect the creature.

3064
03:55:48,045 --> 03:55:55,135
SAM: So there's just a big spherical ball there
with nothing inside of it? Or does the creature

3065
03:55:55,135 --> 03:55:56,985
look like it's inside of it?

3066
03:55:56,985 --> 03:56:00,872
MATT: It looks like it's partway in and partway
out and unaffected by the bead.

3067
03:56:00,872 --> 03:56:02,336
SAM: Holy shit.

3068
03:56:02,391 --> 03:56:04,053
TRAVIS: You're just losing money left and right.

3069
03:56:04,053 --> 03:56:05,057
LAURA: Oh man.

3070
03:56:05,057 --> 03:56:06,258
SAM: This is an expensive trip.

3071
03:56:06,258 --> 03:56:08,756
(laughter)

3072
03:56:08,756 --> 03:56:22,456
SAM: Well then, I will do the heroic thing. As my
bonus action, click my Boots of Speed, and run.

3073
03:56:22,456 --> 03:56:29,637
Just sort of run behind that rock with the gnomes
and try to position

3074
03:56:29,637 --> 03:56:31,525
Doty in between me and the beast.

3075
03:56:31,525 --> 03:56:33,046
MATT: Do you move Doty forward?

3076
03:56:33,046 --> 03:56:36,796
SAM: Just between us. Not forward, just in a
guarding position.

3077
03:56:36,796 --> 03:56:44,870
MATT: Okay, there you go. So Doty just. "Tary."
All right, so that's all Doty does,

3078
03:56:44,870 --> 03:56:46,061
is just get ready?

3079
03:56:46,061 --> 03:56:49,424
SAM: He can't do a separate attack, can he? No.

3080
03:56:49,424 --> 03:56:50,277
MATT: Yeah, he can.

3081
03:56:50,277 --> 03:56:51,242
SAM: Oh, he can?

3082
03:56:51,242 --> 03:56:52,476
MATT: He acts entirely different than you, yeah.

3083
03:56:52,476 --> 03:56:58,037
SAM: Oh jeez. I'm not used to having these things.
Then yes, I'll just have him take a swing at the

3084
03:56:58,037 --> 03:56:59,147
thing, a bash.

3085
03:56:59,147 --> 03:57:01,166
MATT: Okay, he can make a bash and a headbutt.

3086
03:57:01,166 --> 03:57:03,530
SAM: He can make two attacks? This guy's awesome!

3087
03:57:03,530 --> 03:57:08,543
LAURA: Wait, he gets a full action and his
companion animal gets to attack?

3088
03:57:08,543 --> 03:57:09,504
MATT: Yep.

3089
03:57:09,504 --> 03:57:11,107
LAURA: Motherfucker.

3090
03:57:11,107 --> 03:57:12,747
SAM: We're friends.

3091
03:57:12,747 --> 03:57:19,180
MATT: Also, how helpful has Taryon been in
comparison to Vex in the past?

3092
03:57:19,226 --> 03:57:20,848
SAM: Very, I would say.

3093
03:57:20,848 --> 03:57:23,147
LAURA: Well, Tary or Doty?

3094
03:57:23,147 --> 03:57:25,037
MATT: Both.

3095
03:57:25,037 --> 03:57:28,851
SAM: All right, Doty's going to make two attacks,
then.

3096
03:57:28,851 --> 03:57:29,869
MATT: Go for it.

3097
03:57:29,869 --> 03:57:35,888
SAM: Bash and a headbutt. What do I do? I roll
something. I roll a natural 20 on bash.

3098
03:57:35,888 --> 03:57:38,883
TRAVIS: Doty got a natural 20.

3099
03:57:38,883 --> 03:57:43,383
SAM: That is nine points of damage.

3100
03:57:43,383 --> 03:57:44,373
MATT: Awesome.

3101
03:57:44,373 --> 03:57:48,837
SAM: And then going in for the headbutt, one.

3102
03:57:48,837 --> 03:57:58,546
MATT: Doty swings forward, fist goes through, you
watch as the creature (gurgling yelp), and then,

3103
03:57:58,546 --> 03:58:04,989
as it's recoiling, leans forward and gives it a
big old hefty rune-covered Doty headbutt to the

3104
03:58:04,989 --> 03:58:08,889
creature, and it seems impacted by it. Doty? Not
in the circle.

3105
03:58:08,889 --> 03:58:11,087
SAM: Oh.

3106
03:58:11,087 --> 03:58:12,589
LAURA: Doty's not in the circle.

3107
03:58:12,589 --> 03:58:14,086
MATT: Doty's just outside of the circle.

3108
03:58:14,086 --> 03:58:15,337
SAM: But still caused damage?

3109
03:58:15,337 --> 03:58:16,358
MATT: Apparently.

3110
03:58:16,358 --> 03:58:18,134
SAM: What is this magic?

3111
03:58:18,134 --> 03:58:20,565
MARISHA: What was the bead thing?

3112
03:58:20,565 --> 03:58:24,473
MATT: That ends Taryon's turn. Percy.

3113
03:58:24,473 --> 03:58:34,600
TALIESIN: I'm watching all this and highly
confused. I'm going to turn on my boots, and I'm

3114
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:39,602
going to run down towards the creature, and I'm
going to attack it with my silver-laced sword and

3115
03:58:39,602 --> 03:58:40,935
see what happens.

3116
03:58:40,935 --> 03:58:43,811
MATT: Okay, you rush forward at this side, you
come up to it with your silver rapier.

3117
03:58:43,811 --> 03:58:45,384
TALIESIN: And I'm taking a swing.

3118
03:58:45,384 --> 03:58:49,822
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy. See how the other side
lives.

3119
03:58:49,822 --> 03:58:54,364
TALIESIN: No, it's okay, 'cause this is pretty
good. 17.

3120
03:58:54,364 --> 03:58:57,457
MATT: 17. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3121
03:58:57,457 --> 03:59:00,586
MARISHA: Is it piercing?

3122
03:59:00,586 --> 03:59:04,392
LAURA: Slashing damage?

3123
03:59:04,392 --> 03:59:09,899
SAM: You have to be close to it, like you have to
hit it with your fists.

3124
03:59:09,899 --> 03:59:11,820
TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.

3125
03:59:11,820 --> 03:59:16,258
MATT: Okay. You watch as you go in to stab it with
the rapier, as you do it, (shrieks), it retracts

3126
03:59:16,258 --> 03:59:19,140
and you can see parts of it kind of carve open
from the impact.

3127
03:59:19,140 --> 03:59:20,582
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another stab.

3128
03:59:20,582 --> 03:59:21,620
MATT: Go for it.

3129
03:59:21,620 --> 03:59:24,292
TALIESIN: It's a 24.

3130
03:59:24,292 --> 03:59:25,939
MATT: 24, that hits.

3131
03:59:25,939 --> 03:59:30,610
TALIESIN: I'm also going to, out of curiosity, run
d6 worth of Cabal's Ruin through it, just to see

3132
03:59:30,610 --> 03:59:41,437
what happens. So that's-- wow, that really--
that's 14 points of piercing damage and two points

3133
03:59:41,437 --> 03:59:42,789
of electrical damage.

3134
03:59:42,789 --> 03:59:46,960
MATT: Okay, cool. As you stab through with the
sword, electrical energy coursing through, you

3135
03:59:46,960 --> 03:59:52,584
stab through, watch as it carves a big hole in the
side of its smoky physicality, and it kind of

3136
03:59:52,584 --> 03:59:57,239
shrieks in pain and recoils, now some of the faces
turning towards you, noticing the impact.

3137
03:59:57,239 --> 03:59:59,739
TALIESIN: The shock definitely did a thing?

3138
03:59:59,739 --> 04:00:03,867
MATT: The impact did, yeah, you watch the weapon
hit and you watch the shock burst off and the

3139
04:00:03,867 --> 04:00:04,885
creature reacted to it.

3140
04:00:04,885 --> 04:00:11,874
TALIESIN: Okay! Just for fun, I'm taking a third
hit. I'm gonna take a third shot at him. And burn,

3141
04:00:11,966 --> 04:00:19,751
yup. No, a third slice and I'm gonna add, just for
fun, let's do one, two, three, let's do four more

3142
04:00:19,751 --> 04:00:21,470
points of Cabal and see what happens.

3143
04:00:21,470 --> 04:00:22,902
MATT: Okay.

3144
04:00:22,902 --> 04:00:24,004
TALIESIN: So.

3145
04:00:24,004 --> 04:00:28,572
MATT: Third strike, you swing through heavily and
you watch--- How much damage is that?

3146
04:00:28,572 --> 04:00:32,933
TALIESIN: That's 15 points of piercing damage.

3147
04:00:32,933 --> 04:00:34,737
MATT: 15 points of piercing damage.

3148
04:00:34,737 --> 04:00:36,087
TALIESIN: Seven, eight, nine.

3149
04:00:36,087 --> 04:00:37,374
MATT: With?

3150
04:00:37,374 --> 04:00:38,868
TALIESIN: And 13 points of electrical.

3151
04:00:38,868 --> 04:00:44,390
MATT: Nice. Okay. You swing with one wide arc, and
as you do, it leaves this large spray of

3152
04:00:44,390 --> 04:00:48,900
electrical energy that is left behind in pulses
after the blade has already passed through. It's

3153
04:00:48,900 --> 04:00:53,535
almost like a lagging slow-mo burst of electrical
energy behind the blade as it swings, and as it

3154
04:00:53,612 --> 04:00:58,413
does you watch as the smoke dissipates and
retracts from the impact, screaming, and small

3155
04:00:58,413 --> 04:01:05,723
faces you see turn to black mist from where the
blade passed through.

3156
04:01:05,902 --> 04:01:08,500
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'll take three more hits
really quick. I'm going to burn an Action Surge.

3157
04:01:08,500 --> 04:01:10,900
Just do three more real quick. Just going for it.
I'll roll them all at once.

3158
04:01:10,900 --> 04:01:12,184
MATT: Okay.

3159
04:01:12,184 --> 04:01:20,542
TALIESIN: So. That's-- Yeah, that all hits. It's a
11, a 13 and a 17. They all-- they all hit.

3160
04:01:20,542 --> 04:01:23,346
MATT: Yeah. So roll damage three times.

3161
04:01:23,346 --> 04:01:27,683
TALIESIN: That's 11 points.

3162
04:01:27,683 --> 04:01:28,945
MATT: 11.

3163
04:01:28,945 --> 04:01:33,137
TALIESIN: 13 points.

3164
04:01:33,137 --> 04:01:34,196
MATT: 13.

3165
04:01:34,196 --> 04:01:37,043
TALIESIN: And ten points.

3166
04:01:37,043 --> 04:01:42,289
MATT: Ten points! In a series of Zorro-type
slashes, you just carve through. And you watch as

3167
04:01:42,289 --> 04:01:46,971
it's starting to break apart and dissipate. The
screams went from aggressive to now (groaning).

3168
04:01:46,971 --> 04:01:51,827
This, like, deep sucking inhale. It looks like
it's starting to look pretty rough.

3169
04:01:51,827 --> 04:01:53,760
TALIESIN: This is very therapeutic.

3170
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:57,445
MATT: That ends your turn. All right, Vax. You're
up.

3171
04:01:57,445 --> 04:02:01,559
LIAM: Okay. I'm gonna shoot up and do a small
little loop-de-loop and then slam down right next

3172
04:02:01,559 --> 04:02:05,484
to Percival. Right up against it, so that I'm in a
flanking position opposite Doty.

3173
04:02:05,484 --> 04:02:07,535
MATT: Go for it.

3174
04:02:07,535 --> 04:02:10,136
LIAM: And then dagger-dagger-dagger with a little
bit of Smite.

3175
04:02:10,136 --> 04:02:11,256
MATT: All righty.

3176
04:02:11,256 --> 04:02:12,948
TRAVIS: With a little bit of Smite.

3177
04:02:12,948 --> 04:02:16,425
LIAM: First one is a 33.

3178
04:02:16,425 --> 04:02:17,938
MATT: That hits.

3179
04:02:17,938 --> 04:02:26,653
LIAM: Second one is a natural 20. Third one is a
30.

3180
04:02:26,653 --> 04:02:28,955
MATT: All right, all three hit. Second one's a
crit.

3181
04:02:28,955 --> 04:02:29,961
LIAM: Yup.

3182
04:02:29,961 --> 04:02:31,183
MATT: So, Sneak Attack for the first hit?

3183
04:02:31,183 --> 04:02:32,135
LIAM: Right.

3184
04:02:32,135 --> 04:02:33,823
ASHLEY: Get 'im.

3185
04:02:33,823 --> 04:02:43,736
LIAM: Okay, one-- and this is Smite on this. That
one's a seven-- Can I put the Smite on any attack

3186
04:02:43,809 --> 04:02:44,758
I want?

3187
04:02:44,758 --> 04:02:45,946
MATT: Yeah, you can put it on the crit.

3188
04:02:45,946 --> 04:02:48,987
LIAM: I'll save it for the crit, then. Yeah,
seven, 11, 17, 19--

3189
04:02:48,987 --> 04:02:51,981
MATT: Yeah, the ridiculousness of paladins. Oh, a
crit? I'm gonna pump a Smite into it. Oops!

3190
04:02:51,981 --> 04:03:05,043
LIAM: 24, 27, 33, plus the psychic damage. 33
plus-- 41. 48 for the first hit.

3191
04:03:05,043 --> 04:03:07,036
MATT: 48! For the first hit! Shit, man!

3192
04:03:07,036 --> 04:03:08,452
TRAVIS: That's not even the crit!

3193
04:03:08,452 --> 04:03:09,293
LAURA: Yeah.

3194
04:03:09,293 --> 04:03:10,241
MATT: Rogues.

3195
04:03:10,241 --> 04:03:16,578
LIAM: Second attack. Four plus one is five. Plus
the psychic damage-- Is he a fiend? Is he getting

3196
04:03:16,578 --> 04:03:17,806
anything extra from this?

3197
04:03:17,806 --> 04:03:18,812
MATT: No.

3198
04:03:18,812 --> 04:03:28,312
LIAM: Okay. Five plus eight is 13, 14, 15, 14, so
28. 29 for the second hit. Then the Smite.

3199
04:03:28,312 --> 04:03:29,761
LAURA: Do you double it because it's a crit?

3200
04:03:29,761 --> 04:03:30,605
LIAM: I did.

3201
04:03:30,605 --> 04:03:32,617
MATT: Okay, 29? Then, third hit.

3202
04:03:32,617 --> 04:03:35,946
LIAM: Oh, wait! I didn't-- Hold on. Hold on.
four.

3203
04:03:35,946 --> 04:03:37,342
LAURA: Is eight.

3204
04:03:37,342 --> 04:03:43,102
LIAM: Four plus-- There's no bonus. So it was four
plus-- then I got an eight and a two, right? It

3205
04:03:43,102 --> 04:03:44,535
was an eight and a two?

3206
04:03:44,535 --> 04:03:46,719
MATT: 18 times two, 46. Plus one.

3207
04:03:46,719 --> 04:03:49,022
LIAM: Plus 12, 14-- Yeah, that gets me there. 28.
Doubles to 28.

3208
04:03:49,022 --> 04:03:50,196
LAURA: Plus one. 29.

3209
04:03:50,196 --> 04:03:52,167
MATT: 29. That's right, you got it.

3210
04:03:52,167 --> 04:03:54,292
LIAM: And then one little--- Then one little,
itty-bitty--

3211
04:03:54,292 --> 04:03:55,764
MATT: Little, boop! poke in the side.

3212
04:03:55,764 --> 04:03:57,236
LIAM: For four points.

3213
04:03:57,236 --> 04:04:02,105
MATT: Four points, all righty. As you rush down
and stab it in the back, as the blade hits and

3214
04:04:02,105 --> 04:04:07,737
flashes, with just the blast, the creature
(groans), and you carve down, and it feels like

3215
04:04:07,737 --> 04:04:11,746
you're cutting through a cloud, through air-- but
you watch it separate around as the blade carves

3216
04:04:11,746 --> 04:04:15,973
down. You come up with the second swipe, this time
hitting directly. There's a flash of divine energy

3217
04:04:15,973 --> 04:04:20,394
as the burst goes off. You watch the creature take
the impact and separate slowly after where it hit,

3218
04:04:20,394 --> 04:04:25,387
the clouds being pushed back by like a slow-motion
blast of the divine energy you pulse through.

3219
04:04:25,387 --> 04:04:29,493
Third strike, and you swing past and you see it
catch the edge of the side (growls). Reacts to it

3220
04:04:29,493 --> 04:04:32,072
slowly, but it seems to be having an effect.

3221
04:04:32,072 --> 04:04:33,134
LIAM: Feathers. Feathers.

3222
04:04:33,134 --> 04:04:35,526
MATT: Feathers rest to the ground. Okay, Grog.
You're up.

3223
04:04:35,526 --> 04:04:41,938
TRAVIS: Frenzied Rage. Reckless. Great Weapon
Master. All up on him.

3224
04:04:41,938 --> 04:04:43,260
MATT: All right, go for it.

3225
04:04:43,260 --> 04:04:44,282
TRAVIS: All right.

3226
04:04:44,282 --> 04:04:45,360
SAM: Everything.

3227
04:04:45,360 --> 04:04:47,368
LIAM: What's the plan? Rush it!

3228
04:04:47,368 --> 04:04:49,030
TALIESIN: Get her!

3229
04:04:49,030 --> 04:04:53,287
MATT: That is your whole plan, huh? Get her!
Scientific.

3230
04:04:53,287 --> 04:04:54,581
TRAVIS: No, 30 to hit.

3231
04:04:54,581 --> 04:04:55,703
MATT: That hits.

3232
04:04:55,703 --> 04:04:58,072
TRAVIS: Three plus seven.

3233
04:04:58,072 --> 04:05:00,948
TALIESIN: This'll end well.

3234
04:05:00,948 --> 04:05:03,220
TRAVIS: (sighs) 11.

3235
04:05:03,220 --> 04:05:04,505
LIAM: Do the thing, Grog.

3236
04:05:04,505 --> 04:05:09,244
TRAVIS: 28 on the first one? No. 38 on the first
one, because of Great Weapon Master.

3237
04:05:09,244 --> 04:05:10,854
MATT: 38 on the first one.

3238
04:05:10,854 --> 04:05:14,868
TRAVIS: 27.

3239
04:05:14,868 --> 04:05:15,979
MATT: That hits.

3240
04:05:15,979 --> 04:05:26,339
TRAVIS: Minus five. Okay. Ten, 24, 34, 38. Four
points necrotic. 38.

3241
04:05:26,339 --> 04:05:28,267
MATT: Okay. Ooh.

3242
04:05:28,267 --> 04:05:30,498
TRAVIS: Third one--

3243
04:05:30,498 --> 04:05:31,846
MATT: Third hit.

3244
04:05:31,846 --> 04:05:41,513
TRAVIS: 30 minus five. 25. 10, 24, 26, 36.

3245
04:05:41,513 --> 04:05:44,824
SAM: Is that four hits north of 25?

3246
04:05:44,824 --> 04:05:47,030
MATT: It's three hits. And that's over 100 damage
in one round.

3247
04:05:47,030 --> 04:05:48,104
MARISHA: Wow!

3248
04:05:48,104 --> 04:05:49,567
SAM: That would have just straight-up killed me.

3249
04:05:49,567 --> 04:05:53,434
ASHLEY: That's like-- yeah-- oh no.

3250
04:05:53,434 --> 04:05:59,552
MATT: As you swing up and make three giant axe
blows, you watch as each cleave is carving a line

3251
04:05:59,552 --> 04:06:03,293
through this creature. And as you hit with each
axe blow, you watch as its faces begin to

3252
04:06:03,293 --> 04:06:08,724
disappear in smoke. It's almost like with each blow it's
beginning to lose physicality in the world and

3253
04:06:08,724 --> 04:06:12,054
it's beginning to shrink in size. It's still
wailing and screaming in your face, but the

3254
04:06:12,054 --> 04:06:13,896
impacts are making an effect.

3255
04:06:13,896 --> 04:06:14,812
TRAVIS: Nice.

3256
04:06:14,812 --> 04:06:19,386
MATT: That ends your turn, Grog. The creature is
now going to go ahead and swing in a wide circle

3257
04:06:19,386 --> 04:06:21,681
in its desperation. It's going to go ahead and
cause this--

3258
04:06:21,681 --> 04:06:22,769
MARISHA: Top of its turn?

3259
04:06:22,769 --> 04:06:24,091
MATT: Top of its turn, yeah.

3260
04:06:24,091 --> 04:06:25,600
MARISHA: It takes 4d10 of damage.

3261
04:06:25,600 --> 04:06:32,467
MATT: Well it has to make a save. All right. So
what it does is the moonbeam hits down on it, and

3262
04:06:32,467 --> 04:06:36,990
you watch as it seems to not really react to it.
Like it burns a little bit and you see some kind

3263
04:06:36,990 --> 04:06:40,162
of sparkling white energy, but it's not reacting
directly from it at the moment. It seems to be

3264
04:06:40,162 --> 04:06:47,588
like generally trying to avoid it but it's not
seemingly taking any damage from it. Now, it's

3265
04:06:47,588 --> 04:06:50,813
going to go ahead and do a big sweeping strike to
try and hit everything around it. You watch as

3266
04:06:50,813 --> 04:06:56,963
these pseudopods begin to spin like a buzzsaw in
the vicinity. What's your AC, Grog?

3267
04:06:56,963 --> 04:06:58,606
TRAVIS: Advantage against me, too.

3268
04:06:58,606 --> 04:06:59,681
MATT: Yeah, that's right!

3269
04:06:59,681 --> 04:07:01,268
TRAVIS: 17 is my AC.

3270
04:07:01,268 --> 04:07:03,054
MATT: Misses you. Against Trinket.

3271
04:07:03,054 --> 04:07:04,756
TRAVIS: With advantage it misses me?

3272
04:07:04,831 --> 04:07:06,007
SAM: With advantage!

3273
04:07:06,007 --> 04:07:08,013
MATT: Yeah. What's Trinket's AC?

3274
04:07:08,013 --> 04:07:10,368
LAURA: Oh-- 21.

3275
04:07:10,368 --> 04:07:18,696
MATT: 21. Misses. Against Vax-- That's a natural
one. And against Percy, that is a-- What's your

3276
04:07:18,696 --> 04:07:19,743
AC?

3277
04:07:19,743 --> 04:07:20,884
TALIESIN: 18.

3278
04:07:20,884 --> 04:07:21,913
MATT: That misses.

3279
04:07:21,913 --> 04:07:22,949
TRAVIS and LAURA: What?!

3280
04:07:22,949 --> 04:07:25,177
MATT: Oh, and against Doty as well. Doty-- What's
Doty's AC?

3281
04:07:25,177 --> 04:07:25,949
SAM: 12.

3282
04:07:25,949 --> 04:07:26,896
MATT: Misses.

3283
04:07:26,896 --> 04:07:28,676
ALL: What?

3284
04:07:28,676 --> 04:07:32,615
MATT: It spins around and it manages to just have
no effect on any of you. You move out of the way,

3285
04:07:32,615 --> 04:07:36,379
dodge, it misses you, it just passes right through
Doty with no effect.

3286
04:07:36,379 --> 04:07:37,828
TRAVIS: Bad show, mate.

3287
04:07:37,828 --> 04:07:40,397
MATT: That brings us now to Vex's turn.

3288
04:07:40,397 --> 04:07:43,312
LAURA: Has he hit anybody yet?

3289
04:07:43,312 --> 04:07:44,765
ALL: No.

3290
04:07:44,765 --> 04:07:46,408
SAM: He's literally the worst.

3291
04:07:46,408 --> 04:07:51,025
MATT: He's literally the worst creature that's
ever existed.

3292
04:07:51,025 --> 04:07:56,377
MARISHA: Is it safe to like over my earpiece say
like--

3293
04:07:56,451 --> 04:07:57,725
MATT: Wait 'til your turn.

3294
04:07:57,725 --> 04:07:59,480
MARISHA: Oh. Sorry.

3295
04:07:59,480 --> 04:08:01,490
MATT: It's okay. What're you doing, Vex?

3296
04:08:01,490 --> 04:08:07,417
LAURA: I mean, if I'm looking at that creature,
does it look like an illusion? Does it look like

3297
04:08:07,417 --> 04:08:10,040
something we've seen before? Does it look like
it's really there?

3298
04:08:10,040 --> 04:08:12,708
MATT: You can make an investigation check to see,
you might have to go closer.

3299
04:08:12,708 --> 04:08:14,291
LAURA: I'll come down closer.

3300
04:08:14,291 --> 04:08:15,351
MATT: Okay.

3301
04:08:15,351 --> 04:08:20,300
LAURA: I'll have Trinket attack for my bonus. But
I want to just--

3302
04:08:20,300 --> 04:08:24,533
MATT: Trinket has to attack as part of your attack
action. Wait, let me double-check that.

3303
04:08:24,533 --> 04:08:26,103
LAURA: Trinket gets my bonus.

3304
04:08:26,103 --> 04:08:28,545
MATT: I know, I changed that. That's how it used
to be. So yes, you can do that. You can do that.

3305
04:08:28,545 --> 04:08:31,625
LAURA: Okay. So I can have him attack and then
watch?

3306
04:08:31,625 --> 04:08:33,028
MATT: You can have him attack and then watch
him.

3307
04:08:33,028 --> 04:08:36,468
LAURA: I want to watch while he's attacking and
see. And like make an investigation check.

3308
04:08:36,651 --> 04:08:38,591
MATT: Okay. Okay. Have Trinket go ahead and
attack.

3309
04:08:38,591 --> 04:08:39,767
LIAM: Voyeur.

3310
04:08:39,767 --> 04:08:45,288
LAURA: Yeah. I want to watch! Ooh! That's a good
one. 27.

3311
04:08:45,288 --> 04:08:46,768
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

3312
04:08:46,768 --> 04:08:52,875
LAURA: Okay. 12.

3313
04:08:52,875 --> 04:08:55,625
MATT: 12! Is it a bite or a claw?

3314
04:08:55,625 --> 04:08:57,184
LAURA: That was a bite.

3315
04:08:57,184 --> 04:09:01,092
MATT: Trinket reaches out and bites and snatches
through and you watch as the black smoke

3316
04:09:01,092 --> 04:09:08,466
dissipates in the area and screams again in his
face as he pulls back. You're using your action to

3317
04:09:08,466 --> 04:09:09,419
investigate?

3318
04:09:09,419 --> 04:09:10,228
LAURA: Yeah.

3319
04:09:10,228 --> 04:09:16,840
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

3320
04:09:16,840 --> 04:09:20,296
LAURA: 24!

3321
04:09:20,296 --> 04:09:22,872
SAM: What just happened?

3322
04:09:22,872 --> 04:09:24,416
MATT: Pardon me, buddy.

3323
04:09:24,416 --> 04:09:26,084
SAM: Trinket just became a ghost.

3324
04:09:26,084 --> 04:09:28,413
MARISHA: What's going on?

3325
04:09:28,413 --> 04:09:32,884
TALIESIN: Don't! No! No! No!

3326
04:09:32,884 --> 04:09:34,414
ASHLEY: Don't you look, Travis!

3327
04:09:34,414 --> 04:09:35,736
SAM: Do it, Travis!

3328
04:09:35,736 --> 04:09:38,113
TALIESIN: Travis Willingham, you're going to get
in big trouble!

3329
04:09:38,113 --> 04:09:40,119
ASHLEY: Step back! Step back!

3330
04:09:40,119 --> 04:09:43,450
SAM: (laughs) Draw dick-butts all over it

3331
04:09:43,450 --> 04:09:44,652
MATT: All right!

3332
04:09:44,652 --> 04:09:48,472
SAM: Trinket's a ghost!

3333
04:09:48,472 --> 04:09:50,170
MATT: That ends-- that's the end of your turn,
right?

3334
04:09:50,170 --> 04:09:53,363
LAURA: That's the end of my turn. I moved-- that
was my full movement to get up there?

3335
04:09:53,363 --> 04:09:54,684
MATT: No, you can move.

3336
04:09:54,684 --> 04:10:03,119
LAURA: I want to move over back towards the edge
of that rock towards me. I mean, this way--

3337
04:10:03,119 --> 04:10:04,259
MATT: This way?

3338
04:10:04,259 --> 04:10:05,203
LAURA: Sorry.

3339
04:10:05,203 --> 04:10:06,148
MATT: This way?

3340
04:10:06,148 --> 04:10:08,036
LAURA: Yes. Closer to the gnomes.

3341
04:10:08,036 --> 04:10:16,306
MATT: Closer to the gnomes. Okay. Well, since I
left my-- imagine you're flying for this one. I

3342
04:10:16,306 --> 04:10:18,903
left my pillars at Force Grey. So. I'm going to
have those back.

3343
04:10:18,903 --> 04:10:20,346
LAURA: Oh! Am I flying?

3344
04:10:20,346 --> 04:10:22,560
MATT: I figured you were since you usually are.
Unless you don't want to.

3345
04:10:22,560 --> 04:10:23,742
LAURA: No no no. I'm not flying right now.

3346
04:10:23,742 --> 04:10:28,911
MATT: Okay. Then you're back by the gnomes. All
right, cool. That ends Vex's turn.

3347
04:10:28,911 --> 04:10:30,575
Keyleth, you're up.

3348
04:10:30,575 --> 04:10:35,459
LAURA: And I can I say anything over my head-- My
earring? Without the gnomes hearing me, I want to

3349
04:10:35,459 --> 04:10:40,424
go, it's not real. It's not real. They're fucking
us.

3350
04:10:40,424 --> 04:10:43,231
SAM: (gasps) The gnomes are?

3351
04:10:43,231 --> 04:10:47,013
MATT: Okay. Keyleth. Your turn.

3352
04:10:47,071 --> 04:10:50,705
ASHLEY: Motherfuckers.

3353
04:10:50,705 --> 04:10:52,021
SAM: Kill them!

3354
04:10:52,021 --> 04:10:53,421
MARISHA: What?

3355
04:10:53,421 --> 04:10:55,305
LAURA: Play it out. Just play it out.

3356
04:10:55,305 --> 04:10:56,912
SAM: Okay.

3357
04:10:56,912 --> 04:10:58,007
MARISHA: Play it out?

3358
04:10:58,007 --> 04:10:59,056
SAM: Play it out.

3359
04:10:59,056 --> 04:11:03,306
MARISHA: Okay, I want to step forward a little
bit.

3360
04:11:03,306 --> 04:11:06,644
MATT: Okay. You step forward a little bit.

3361
04:11:06,644 --> 04:11:11,657
MARISHA: Can I make out details of the space? Of
the faces that are in it?

3362
04:11:11,657 --> 04:11:14,505
MATT: There are multiple faces. They're all
different creature faces. They all look to be

3363
04:11:14,505 --> 04:11:17,702
humanoid. They're all shouting and screaming and
shifting and roiling inside.

3364
04:11:17,702 --> 04:11:24,943
MARISHA: Can I do a perception check to see if I
recognize either Pike's face in there or Ogden's

3365
04:11:24,943 --> 04:11:28,840
face or any of the gnomes' face? Do I recognize
any faces?

3366
04:11:28,840 --> 04:11:30,399
MATT: Sure. This would be your action to do that,
but yeah.

3367
04:11:30,399 --> 04:11:31,611
MARISHA: My whole action?

3368
04:11:31,611 --> 04:11:32,628
MATT: Yeah.

3369
04:11:32,628 --> 04:11:34,267
MARISHA: Okay.

3370
04:11:34,267 --> 04:11:36,293
MATT: Make a perception check.

3371
04:11:36,293 --> 04:11:44,408
MARISHA: Great, 17.

3372
04:11:44,408 --> 04:11:49,584
MATT: Okay. Glancing at it, all the faces seem
relatively blank and it's mostly the same face

3373
04:11:49,584 --> 04:11:52,522
over and over and over again. So there's no real
variation to them.

3374
04:11:52,522 --> 04:11:58,222
MARISHA: Okay. And that's my whole action?

3375
04:11:58,222 --> 04:11:59,425
MATT: That's your whole action, yeah.

3376
04:11:59,425 --> 04:12:01,680
MARISHA: Okay. That's my action.

3377
04:12:01,680 --> 04:12:08,627
MATT: Okay. So at this point, the gnomes over here
are just staying where they are. You watch as

3378
04:12:08,627 --> 04:12:14,641
Ogden takes another hobbled step back past Taryon
and goes, "Protect me!" and puts his hand up to

3379
04:12:14,641 --> 04:12:21,833
you and kind of hides partially behind you,
Taryon. JB stays there. She seems relatively safe

3380
04:12:21,833 --> 04:12:27,853
and watches as Vex approaches and is like (heavy
breathing) and moves along the side of the rock.

3381
04:12:27,853 --> 04:12:29,517
Pike, your turn.

3382
04:12:29,517 --> 04:12:31,056
TRAVIS: The gnomes aren't doing anything?

3383
04:12:31,056 --> 04:12:32,035
MATT: No.

3384
04:12:32,035 --> 04:12:50,920
ASHLEY: Well, that's a turn of events. Okay. Am I
close to-- Who's the closest gnome? Can I get to

3385
04:12:50,920 --> 04:12:52,160
them?

3386
04:12:52,160 --> 04:12:58,601
MATT: The closest gnome to you would probably be
Astra. She's over here.

3387
04:12:58,601 --> 04:13:05,902
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to--

3388
04:13:05,902 --> 04:13:11,880
TRAVIS: (whispers) What if they did all of this to
get us away from Whitestone?

3389
04:13:11,880 --> 04:13:13,797
ASHLEY: Go up to her.

3390
04:13:13,797 --> 04:13:16,775
MATT: So you walk up to Astra. Most of your
movement there as you back up.

3391
04:13:16,775 --> 04:13:24,553
ASHLEY: And I'm going to put my mace up to her
throat and say--

3392
04:13:24,553 --> 04:13:27,078
SAM: (whispers) They're robbing the bakery right
now!

3393
04:13:27,078 --> 04:13:31,420
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah! How many pastries did you
steal?

3394
04:13:31,420 --> 04:13:37,238
MARISHA: How many fucking pastries did they take?

3395
04:13:37,238 --> 04:13:42,311
ASHLEY: I'm going to say, what the fuck is going
on? I know this is not real.

3396
04:13:42,311 --> 04:13:44,859
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3397
04:13:44,859 --> 04:13:46,372
SAM: To whom?

3398
04:13:46,372 --> 04:13:47,765
MARISHA: Come on, Pike!

3399
04:13:47,765 --> 04:13:50,933
LAURA: To mustachio and his wife.

3400
04:13:50,933 --> 04:13:55,984
LAURA: Oh, I thought that was a natural 20.

3401
04:13:55,984 --> 04:14:02,756
ASHLEY: Where's intimidation? 11.

3402
04:14:02,756 --> 04:14:07,996
MATT: 11? As soon as you put the mace she goes,
"Pike! What are you doing?! Pike! The creature's

3403
04:14:07,996 --> 04:14:10,613
"still alive!" And she points over in that
direction, she's not paying

3404
04:14:10,613 --> 04:14:11,944
much mind to your threat.

3405
04:14:11,944 --> 04:14:20,749
ASHLEY: Damn it. Okay. (laughs) Oh, shit.

3406
04:14:20,749 --> 04:14:22,259
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

3407
04:14:22,259 --> 04:14:35,191
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know. Can I-- How accurate can I
be with a Guiding Bolt? Is that dependent on--

3408
04:14:35,191 --> 04:14:39,994
MATT: You can be pretty accurate with a Guiding
Bolt, but Guiding Bolt is an action.

3409
04:14:39,994 --> 04:14:48,076
ASHLEY: Oh shit, yeah. Fuck. I'm gonna drop the
mace on her foot.

3410
04:14:48,076 --> 04:14:53,606
MATT: Okay, so this is less of an attack and more
of dropping it on her foot. As it hits, we'll say,

3411
04:14:53,606 --> 04:14:58,790
'cause you dropped it on it, she goes (yelps) and
she picks her foot off, pulling it out from

3412
04:14:58,790 --> 04:15:05,224
underneath and it's-- She's wearing a light
leather boot. It hurt her toe pretty bad. She's

3413
04:15:05,224 --> 04:15:13,117
like (sounds of pain) and Johann's like, "Astra,
are you okay?" "Pike, be careful!" He's kind of

3414
04:15:13,117 --> 04:15:15,683
helping her. Does that end your turn?

3415
04:15:15,683 --> 04:15:17,131
ASHLEY: I guess so!

3416
04:15:17,131 --> 04:15:18,575
MATT: All right, Taryon, you're up.

3417
04:15:18,575 --> 04:15:22,450
MARISHA: So wait, that's Johann? Or
what's-his-name and his wife?

3418
04:15:22,508 --> 04:15:23,196
LAURA: Yeah.

3419
04:15:23,196 --> 04:15:24,434
MARISHA: Where the fuck is JB?

3420
04:15:24,434 --> 04:15:25,590
LAURA: They're over by me.

3421
04:15:25,590 --> 04:15:26,535
MATT: She's right there.

3422
04:15:26,535 --> 04:15:30,505
SAM: Are JB and Ogden together?

3423
04:15:30,505 --> 04:15:37,024
MATT: JB is over on-- like ten feet to your left.
Ogden's just right next to you, almost holding

3424
04:15:37,024 --> 04:15:42,387
onto your-- the back of your leg for protection.
And he's like, "Protect me!"

3425
04:15:42,387 --> 04:15:43,796
SAM: Sure. Sure.

3426
04:15:43,796 --> 04:15:45,308
LAURA: Hands up, motherfucker.

3427
04:15:45,308 --> 04:15:46,789
MARISHA: Yeah, right? What's that? What is that?

3428
04:15:46,851 --> 04:15:48,746
LAURA: I know! He's been holding his hand up like
woo.

3429
04:15:48,801 --> 04:15:50,788
SAM: I'm just gonna break free from Ogden.

3430
04:15:50,788 --> 04:15:51,984
MATT: Okay.

3431
04:15:51,984 --> 04:15:55,064
SAM: And I'm going to whip out another bead and
throw it right at him.

3432
04:15:55,064 --> 04:15:58,200
(laughter)

3433
04:15:58,200 --> 04:16:02,043
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

3434
04:16:02,043 --> 04:16:03,922
TALIESIN: That's a good call.

3435
04:16:03,922 --> 04:16:07,123
SAM: It's a dexterity save. 15

3436
04:16:07,123 --> 04:16:12,682
MATT: That is a no. That is a no-no-no.

3437
04:16:12,682 --> 04:16:15,250
SAM: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.

3438
04:16:15,250 --> 04:16:26,802
MATT: That was a natural four to an addled old
man. All right, so roll 5d4 force damage.

3439
04:16:26,802 --> 04:16:38,601
SAM: Okay. Four, one, four, three. Oh shit, I
should probably be adding these. That's nine.

3440
04:16:38,656 --> 04:16:40,352
That's 12.

3441
04:16:40,352 --> 04:16:50,060
MATT: As you throw the bead down, it bursts in a
flash of energy and light, and you watch as

3442
04:16:50,060 --> 04:16:56,738
Ogden's staff just gets fucking thrown 25 feet in
the air from the blast. He's like (yells). He falls on

3443
04:16:56,798 --> 04:17:01,648
his side and gets back up, and you see him now
encased in this sphere of force. Immediately this

3444
04:17:01,648 --> 04:17:03,887
smoke creature vanishes.

3445
04:17:03,887 --> 04:17:10,688
SAM: I'll say, Doty! Carry him to the edge of the
cliff.

3446
04:17:10,688 --> 04:17:13,115
MARISHA: Oh shit!

3447
04:17:13,115 --> 04:17:16,067
MATT: Can Doty-- I don't think Doty can move the
sphere, can he?

3448
04:17:16,067 --> 04:17:20,182
SAM: The sphere weighs one pound, regardless of
what is inside of it.

3449
04:17:20,182 --> 04:17:21,448
MATT: Okay!

3450
04:17:21,448 --> 04:17:25,148
TRAVIS: Really? That's fucking amazing. Are you
serious?

3451
04:17:25,148 --> 04:17:27,141
LIAM: Gently!

3452
04:17:27,141 --> 04:17:28,920
TRAVIS: How big can the sphere get?

3453
04:17:28,920 --> 04:17:31,598
SAM: It's ten by ten. I mean, encircled--

3454
04:17:31,598 --> 04:17:33,146
MATT: Yeah, it's a hamster ball.

3455
04:17:33,146 --> 04:17:34,722
ASHLEY: (groans) I'm so mad!

3456
04:17:34,722 --> 04:17:37,302
TRAVIS: You can carry him to the cliff!

3457
04:17:37,302 --> 04:17:42,466
LAURA: Maybe it was just to steal a thousand-gold
diamond. Maybe it was just to steal the diamond.

3458
04:17:42,466 --> 04:17:51,197
MATT: He's just like-- at this point, he goes,
"You killed it! That's amazing! Pike is saved!"

3459
04:17:51,197 --> 04:17:56,131
The sphere gets picked up. "Wait! Huh?"

3460
04:17:56,131 --> 04:17:58,446
LAURA: I pick JB up by her wrist.

3461
04:17:58,446 --> 04:18:04,184
MATT: Okay, she's just starting to dart off and
you grab her by the wrist. Go ahead and make a

3462
04:18:04,184 --> 04:18:06,265
grapple check. Make an athletics check.

3463
04:18:06,265 --> 04:18:12,851
LAURA: Oh no. Athletics, huh? Eight.

3464
04:18:12,851 --> 04:18:17,895
MATT: Eight? You go to grab for her wrist, and as
you grab she wrenches out of it and goes darting

3465
04:18:17,895 --> 04:18:18,851
this way.

3466
04:18:18,851 --> 04:18:20,504
LIAM: I'm blasting off after her.

3467
04:18:20,504 --> 04:18:28,205
MARISHA: I'm going to go after Johann and Astra.
And can I do an Entangle spell around her?

3468
04:18:28,205 --> 04:18:31,302
MATT: What's the DC, or the save on that?

3469
04:18:31,302 --> 04:18:37,504
MARISHA: I haven't done an Entangle in a second--
give me a second.

3470
04:18:37,504 --> 04:18:40,717
MATT: I have it right here. It is a strength check
against your spell DC.

3471
04:18:40,717 --> 04:18:42,719
MARISHA: Beat a 20, bitch!

3472
04:18:42,719 --> 04:18:49,376
MATT: So! You watch as they both turn invisible.
And then all of a sudden a bunch of vines go

3473
04:18:49,467 --> 04:18:51,747
(crinkles) around a gnome-like form.

3474
04:18:51,747 --> 04:18:54,007
(cheering)

3475
04:18:54,007 --> 04:18:58,557
LAURA: I'm gonna Grasping Vine JB as she starts to
run off.

3476
04:18:58,557 --> 04:19:03,200
MARISHA: Do it! Do it! Do it! Ranger!

3477
04:19:03,200 --> 04:19:05,050
MATT: She gets some distance. What's the Grasping
Vine--

3478
04:19:05,050 --> 04:19:06,269
TRAVIS: Is Ogden the one in the sphere?

3479
04:19:06,269 --> 04:19:07,881
LAURA: Spell save 15.

3480
04:19:07,881 --> 04:19:12,032
MATT: 15, dexterity. Natural 20.

3481
04:19:12,108 --> 04:19:13,419
LAURA: Motherfucker!

3482
04:19:13,419 --> 04:19:17,999
MATT: You put the Grasping Vine out and she
just-- (heavy breathing).

3483
04:19:18,048 --> 04:19:19,352
TALIESIN: Okay, forget this.

3484
04:19:19,352 --> 04:19:22,073
LIAM: Wait-wait! I already said I'm winged and
Hasted, I'm already there! She can't go anywhere.

3485
04:19:22,073 --> 04:19:24,815
MATT: I know, all right. So as you aim, you watch
as a raven swoops down.

3486
04:19:24,815 --> 04:19:26,012
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3487
04:19:26,012 --> 04:19:28,154
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

3488
04:19:28,154 --> 04:19:31,247
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep watching.

3489
04:19:31,247 --> 04:19:33,403
SAM: Oh, Matt is so fucking good.

3490
04:19:33,403 --> 04:19:34,729
ASHLEY: Fuck.

3491
04:19:34,729 --> 04:19:35,608
LIAM: 19.

3492
04:19:35,608 --> 04:19:36,767
MATT: Natural one.

3493
04:19:36,767 --> 04:19:37,843
LAURA: Yes!

3494
04:19:37,843 --> 04:19:43,570
MATT: You grab her and lift her off the ground and
she's now screaming as you pick her up into the

3495
04:19:43,570 --> 04:19:48,217
sky, the moonlight still kind of casting down.
Doty is now carrying this sphere and walking

3496
04:19:48,217 --> 04:19:50,058
towards the edge over here.

3497
04:19:50,058 --> 04:19:52,610
LIAM: Yeah, I'll take her 100 feet up and give her
a good view.

3498
04:19:52,610 --> 04:20:02,421
MATT: Okay, she's breathing super, super fast. And
at this point you see, as he's walking over to the

3499
04:20:02,421 --> 04:20:09,786
edge, Ogden's like, "You-- Look! You saved
everyone! Good job!"

3500
04:20:09,786 --> 04:20:11,184
(laughter)

3501
04:20:11,184 --> 04:20:15,896
SAM: He's committed to this bit!

3502
04:20:15,896 --> 04:20:19,908
TALIESIN: Don't overcommit! Don't overcommit! No!

3503
04:20:19,908 --> 04:20:26,246
SAM: So you rush over towards him, as Doty's got
him maybe ten feet from the edge and now you can

3504
04:20:26,246 --> 04:20:32,507
see as he's like, "Oh! Pike?"

3505
04:20:32,507 --> 04:20:35,913
ASHLEY: Oh, Doty's not finished walking yet. Doty,
keep going.

3506
04:20:35,913 --> 04:20:44,532
MATT: "Pike, Pike. We have-- You have been saved
from the darkness of a family line of terrible curses."

3507
04:20:44,713 --> 04:20:48,734
LAURA: Dicks! Motherfuckers!

3508
04:20:48,734 --> 04:20:54,170
MATT: He's walked to the very edge of the cliff.
"Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, what would Sarenrae

3509
04:20:54,170 --> 04:20:55,908
"think? What would Sarenrae think?"

3510
04:20:55,908 --> 04:20:57,537
TRAVIS: He's so lively all of a sudden.

3511
04:20:57,537 --> 04:21:03,777
MATT: Yeah, more so than you've ever seen him.
He's been crotchety and immobile this whole time,

3512
04:21:03,777 --> 04:21:07,729
and now you watch him up against the glass and
he's standing up straight, and he's like, "Pike,

3513
04:21:07,729 --> 04:21:11,047
"Pike, seriously, it's fine. It's fine. What would
Sarenrae think?"

3514
04:21:11,047 --> 04:21:16,973
TALIESIN: I'm gonna walk below the cliff and just
stand on the cliff and start knocking on the

3515
04:21:16,973 --> 04:21:20,959
ball on the other side and waving so he
can get a nice view of the drop down.

3516
04:21:21,017 --> 04:21:24,109
MATT: "Oh. No-no-no! Seriously, it's fine. We're
family."

3517
04:21:24,109 --> 04:21:25,199
ASHLEY: Ogden?

3518
04:21:25,199 --> 04:21:26,019
MATT: "Yes?"

3519
04:21:26,019 --> 04:21:27,749
ASHLEY: Where's the diamond?

3520
04:21:27,749 --> 04:21:29,201
MATT: "I-- it was used in the spell!"

3521
04:21:29,201 --> 04:21:30,660
ASHLEY: No, it wasn't.

3522
04:21:30,660 --> 04:21:33,284
MATT: "The spell that we used to summon the
creature."

3523
04:21:33,284 --> 04:21:39,660
ASHLEY: It's-- Ogden. That was bullshit.

3524
04:21:39,728 --> 04:21:41,453
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3525
04:21:41,453 --> 04:21:42,904
ASHLEY: God damn it!

3526
04:21:42,904 --> 04:21:45,433
TRAVIS: Does his fear grant advantage?

3527
04:21:45,433 --> 04:21:48,188
MATT: I'd say you have advantage, given this
circumstance.

3528
04:21:48,188 --> 04:21:49,235
LAURA: Yeah!

3529
04:21:49,235 --> 04:21:51,373
MATT: Given this circumstance, you definitely have
advantage.

3530
04:21:51,373 --> 04:21:52,890
ASHLEY: 15.

3531
04:21:52,890 --> 04:22:03,784
MATT: He goes, (sighs), and holds the diamond out
in front.

3532
04:22:03,784 --> 04:22:05,075
ASHLEY: Is he still in the ball?

3533
04:22:05,075 --> 04:22:06,363
SAM: Yeah, he's still in the ball.

3534
04:22:06,363 --> 04:22:07,638
ASHLEY: Push him out further.

3535
04:22:07,638 --> 04:22:11,428
SAM: Doty, just hold him over the edge.

3536
04:22:11,428 --> 04:22:13,739
MATT: Doty goes and-- "Tary."

3537
04:22:13,739 --> 04:22:17,903
"No-no-no!" He's now
looking down at the sphere of force below him and

3538
04:22:17,903 --> 04:22:24,182
looking down to the waves crashing at the very,
very small, distant shore.

3539
04:22:24,182 --> 04:22:28,353
"You can have the diamond back! It's just--"

3540
04:22:28,353 --> 04:22:35,590
SAM: What's the play here? What's the game? What
were you trying to get? Not that diamond. There's

3541
04:22:35,590 --> 04:22:38,714
more to it than that.

3542
04:22:38,714 --> 04:22:45,932
MATT: "Look. We don't have a lot. You have plenty.
We hear of all the great deeds you've done. All

3543
04:22:45,932 --> 04:22:50,088
the dragons you've killed. All the vast amounts of
money and gold you've procured the past couple

3544
04:22:50,088 --> 04:22:59,591
years of your adventures. And we get sent a measly
sum! A small hint of nothing but a paltry pinch."

3545
04:22:59,591 --> 04:23:01,739
LAURA: She didn't have to send you anything, you
dick!

3546
04:23:01,739 --> 04:23:11,017
MATT: "She didn't! And yet, we came to offer you
nothing but a fantastical story of redemption and

3547
04:23:11,017 --> 04:23:17,565
"the healing of a family, and you got to know your
cousin who you've not spoken to since you left."

3548
04:23:17,565 --> 04:23:28,168
ASHLEY: I trusted you. I put myself out there and
I trusted you.

3549
04:23:28,168 --> 04:23:33,347
MATT: The sphere dissipates. It's been a minute.
And he goes (screams) and

3550
04:23:33,347 --> 04:23:34,657
just plummets off the side.

3551
04:23:34,657 --> 04:23:36,322
TALIESIN: I was technically right below it.

3552
04:23:36,322 --> 04:23:37,663
LAURA: That's true.

3553
04:23:37,663 --> 04:23:38,955
TALIESIN: I'm gonna make a grab.

3554
04:23:38,955 --> 04:23:43,574
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw.

3555
04:23:43,574 --> 04:23:45,934
TALIESIN: I was kind of prepared for this.

3556
04:23:45,934 --> 04:23:49,234
LIAM: I'm way up high and I say, I don't know
what's going on, but it does not look good here.

3557
04:23:49,234 --> 04:23:50,859
(laughter)

3558
04:23:50,859 --> 04:23:58,084
TALIESIN: Dex saving throw? You know. I'm going to
re-roll that.

3559
04:23:58,084 --> 04:23:59,587
SAM: What? You can just do that?

3560
04:23:59,587 --> 04:24:05,992
TALIESIN: I'm going to use a Resolve. Yeah. It's
the exact same roll.

3561
04:24:05,992 --> 04:24:07,523
MATT: What is it?

3562
04:24:07,523 --> 04:24:09,925
TALIESIN: Dex saving roll-- it's 11.

3563
04:24:09,925 --> 04:24:14,160
MATT: (whiff) (screams)

3564
04:24:14,160 --> 04:24:20,852
LIAM: Wait, in that second I can go 500 feet in
six seconds, so can I blast down towards the cliff

3565
04:24:20,852 --> 04:24:23,273
and dump her ten feet and keep going?

3566
04:24:23,273 --> 04:24:26,292
TRAVIS: That's going to be the most gnarly
drop-off ever.

3567
04:24:26,292 --> 04:24:27,508
MATT: Not safely?

3568
04:24:27,508 --> 04:24:28,831
LIAM: Safely?

3569
04:24:28,831 --> 04:24:30,275
ASHLEY: She's gonna break some legs. it's okay.

3570
04:24:30,275 --> 04:24:35,051
LIAM: Safely? Safely? I will go (whoosh) and let
her take a little damage and hit the bottom. You

3571
04:24:35,051 --> 04:24:35,938
know, I'm not gonna--

3572
04:24:35,938 --> 04:24:37,831
MATT: Where are you dropping her? You're over here
right now, you picked her up

3573
04:24:37,831 --> 04:24:38,776
and went over this way.

3574
04:24:38,776 --> 04:24:45,303
LIAM: I can go like (plane sounds). I'll take a
little turn up and let her-- she can take some

3575
04:24:45,303 --> 04:24:46,278
damage.

3576
04:24:46,278 --> 04:24:47,325
TALIESIN: She can take some damage.

3577
04:24:47,325 --> 04:24:49,073
LIAM: Or we could let the dude die, but I'm
already doing it.

3578
04:24:49,073 --> 04:24:54,415
MATT: She tumbles. Stops about five feet from the
edge. She's still hyperventilating.

3579
04:24:54,415 --> 04:24:56,392
LIAM: I've got 400 more feet to go.

3580
04:24:56,392 --> 04:25:01,232
MATT: You dive down. He's just like (screams).
Just tumbling down as he falls faster towards the

3581
04:25:01,232 --> 04:25:05,662
cliff rocks and you can just barely see the waves
crashing from the moonlight that's hitting him as

3582
04:25:05,723 --> 04:25:08,291
you're just in a full-on raven dive towards it.

3583
04:25:08,291 --> 04:25:09,857
LIAM: Bullet train, baby.

3584
04:25:09,857 --> 04:25:10,968
LAURA: Oh God!

3585
04:25:10,968 --> 04:25:16,846
MARISHA: Can I take her and Grasping Vine and
throw her into my entanglement and just keep all

3586
04:25:16,846 --> 04:25:18,138
of them entangled?

3587
04:25:18,138 --> 04:25:20,867
MATT: Grasping Vine is a concentration spell,
you'll lose the entanglement if you do it.

3588
04:25:20,867 --> 04:25:24,197
LAURA: That's okay. I'm going to use the Rope of
Entanglement that I have and use it on her.

3589
04:25:24,197 --> 04:25:28,363
MATT: And with that, without even really much of a
resistance from her, she's tangled up in the rope,

3590
04:25:28,363 --> 04:25:39,434
and falls on the ground on her side. Go ahead and
make a dexterity saving throw.

3591
04:25:39,434 --> 04:25:41,675
LIAM: Saving throw? Okay.

3592
04:25:41,675 --> 04:25:48,770
MATT: Actually, for this in particular, because
it's less of a reaction, this is a-- make a

3593
04:25:48,770 --> 04:25:51,728
dexterity check. This is just a plus your
dexterity bonus.

3594
04:25:51,728 --> 04:26:01,527
LIAM: Okay. I have Luck. I've got one Luck left.
20.

3595
04:26:01,527 --> 04:26:11,023
MATT: You reach out once and grab a section of the
cloth and it tears-- and he keeps plummeting. You

3596
04:26:11,023 --> 04:26:18,694
watch as the stones below-- it's a jagged base of
the Salted Bluffs. About ten feet before impact,

3597
04:26:18,694 --> 04:26:27,060
as his screaming has stopped-- and you grab him
and just (whff) right across the surface of the

3598
04:26:27,060 --> 04:26:32,622
water, but inches! His toes-- the tips of his feet
skid across the surface of the water as you

3599
04:26:32,622 --> 04:26:39,513
(whoosh) and rocket him straight back up towards
the top of the cliff. It's going to take you a

3600
04:26:39,513 --> 04:26:40,791
little while to get up there now.

3601
04:26:40,791 --> 04:26:41,564
LIAM: Sure.

3602
04:26:41,564 --> 04:26:45,301
MATT: Diving is one thing. He is unconscious in
your grasp.

3603
04:26:45,301 --> 04:26:48,621
LIAM: And the Haste is gone by the time I've gone
through all that?

3604
04:26:48,621 --> 04:26:53,708
MATT: Yeah. So you're slowly flying your way back
up. You guys are bent over and you can see the

3605
04:26:53,708 --> 04:26:57,510
raven wings-- you can't quite see whether or not he
got him, but all you see is Vax slowly making his

3606
04:26:57,510 --> 04:26:58,940
way back towards the top of the cliff.

3607
04:26:58,940 --> 04:27:03,528
TALIESIN: Should we tell them if he survived? Or
do you want to surprise them? I say loudly enough

3608
04:27:03,528 --> 04:27:04,986
for everybody to hear.

3609
04:27:04,986 --> 04:27:06,318
ASHLEY: Surprise them!

3610
04:27:06,318 --> 04:27:07,885
LAURA: How about you tell us.

3611
04:27:07,885 --> 04:27:12,629
TALIESIN: I'm pulling back up. Oh yeah, he's
fine.

3612
04:27:12,629 --> 04:27:15,888
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over to JB. She's
tangled?

3613
04:27:15,888 --> 04:27:18,484
MATT: She's wrapped up in the rope and she's like
(breathing heavily).

3614
04:27:18,484 --> 04:27:24,741
ASHLEY: I'm going to slowly start untangling her.

3615
04:27:24,741 --> 04:27:27,861
MATT: "Hi, Pike."

3616
04:27:27,861 --> 04:27:37,606
ASHLEY: Hi, JB. For starters--

3617
04:27:37,606 --> 04:27:42,826
MATT: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

3618
04:27:42,900 --> 04:27:54,662
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine. I'm sorry I didn't
spend more time with you. But this is

3619
04:27:54,662 --> 04:28:15,521
unacceptable. This is not how you treat family.
And if anything, I hope you learn from this. What

3620
04:28:15,521 --> 04:28:25,720
do you want? What do you want from me? Tell me and
I'll give it to you.

3621
04:28:25,720 --> 04:28:33,781
MATT: "I don't care about the money, that's what
they wanted. Honestly, I just used this as an

3622
04:28:33,781 --> 04:28:43,111
"excuse to get to see you again. It would have been
fine if no one had found out anything. We would

3623
04:28:43,111 --> 04:28:48,761
"have been heroes. We would have had no reason to
not be friends again. We would have saved you, as

3624
04:28:48,761 --> 04:28:56,649
"far as you know, from a terrible curse, and maybe
that would have-- maybe then I would have been a

3625
04:28:56,649 --> 04:29:15,797
"hero to you. But I'm nothing. I'm a caretaker to a
swindler and move around too much to make any real

3626
04:29:15,797 --> 04:29:19,085
"friends, so that's just my lot in life, I guess."

3627
04:29:19,085 --> 04:29:21,481
ASHLEY: It doesn't have to be.

3628
04:29:21,481 --> 04:29:24,815
MATT: "That's all I know."

3629
04:29:24,815 --> 04:29:35,649
ASHLEY: But you're very smart. I think there's
more for you in this life than you know.

3630
04:29:35,649 --> 04:29:44,110
MATT: You can see now, she's just tears now, at
this point.

3631
04:29:44,187 --> 04:29:46,969
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over to Johann and
Astra.

3632
04:29:46,969 --> 04:29:50,946
MATT: Okay. Yeah, they've let the invisibility
down at this point. They're both just entangled.

3633
04:29:50,946 --> 04:30:00,463
"Oh! There's some sort of misunderstanding here.
We were under the impression that there was a

3634
04:30:00,463 --> 04:30:01,600
"terrible curse."

3635
04:30:01,600 --> 04:30:02,493
ASHLEY: "Money?"

3636
04:30:02,493 --> 04:30:07,056
MATT: "No! No! We-- Look. Look! Okay. Look, we
have been following--"

3637
04:30:07,114 --> 04:30:08,725
MARISHA: I tighten the grasp on them.

3638
04:30:08,725 --> 04:30:20,241
MATT: (squeals) "We've been following that man
because he is-- He's my dad. And we're really

3639
04:30:20,241 --> 04:30:28,053
"broke. And we blew through all the money you sent
us very quickly. I mean, come on. How much do you

3640
04:30:28,053 --> 04:30:36,319
"guys got? Like ten thousand gold? That's more than
we'll see in our lifetime. Drop in the bucket.

3641
04:30:36,319 --> 04:30:42,244
"Changed our life. You would have been fine! You
would have been great! You wouldn't have known any

3642
04:30:42,244 --> 04:30:47,105
"better. Our lives would have improved drastically.
We would have gone our own way. But maybe stayed

3643
04:30:47,105 --> 04:30:53,142
"for a week! Made you dinner. But here we are. Are
we bad? Are we evil? I don't think so. But that's

3644
04:30:53,142 --> 04:31:01,221
"up to you, Miss Priest." At this point, Astra's
like, "Shh. Honey, honey! Just calm down." And

3645
04:31:01,221 --> 04:31:05,560
he's like, "No! No-no-no-no. No. Okay. She can
think she's better than us, that's fine. You want

3646
04:31:05,560 --> 04:31:07,900
"to fight the Trickfoot name, that's great. You're
still a Trick--"

3647
04:31:07,900 --> 04:31:09,078
MARISHA: And I go, and down.

3648
04:31:09,078 --> 04:31:15,397
MATT: He hits the ground and all you hear is
muffled, "But she's still one of us."

3649
04:31:15,397 --> 04:31:19,138
(laughter)

3650
04:31:19,138 --> 04:31:25,065
MATT: And Astra goes, "You did kind of drop a mace
on my toe."

3651
04:31:25,065 --> 04:31:28,345
ASHLEY: Oh, I know. That was on purpose.

3652
04:31:28,345 --> 04:31:30,251
MATT: "Yeah, I gathered as much."

3653
04:31:30,251 --> 04:31:36,005
ASHLEY: Oh! I'm so mad!

3654
04:31:36,005 --> 04:31:37,286
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3655
04:31:37,286 --> 04:31:40,045
TRAVIS: Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

3656
04:31:40,045 --> 04:31:43,902
ASHLEY: Where's Ogden?

3657
04:31:43,902 --> 04:31:53,205
MATT: You wait another few minutes. It's a long
flight up at this point without the Haste. I mean,

3658
04:31:53,205 --> 04:31:56,824
the winds do help a little bit, because the winds
are hitting the cliff and heading upwards. So the

3659
04:31:56,824 --> 04:32:01,218
updraft does help a bit, but it takes about five or
six minutes or so for him to eventually get his

3660
04:32:01,277 --> 04:32:09,021
way back up to the top. Probably longer than that,
even. Then eventually you watch as Vax returns and

3661
04:32:09,021 --> 04:32:16,533
drops an unconscious, unmoving Ogden onto the
rocky cliffside floor.

3662
04:32:16,533 --> 04:32:19,483
LIAM: Old bugger looks so sweet when he's
sleeping.

3663
04:32:19,483 --> 04:32:22,419
ASHLEY: Does he still have the diamond with him?

3664
04:32:22,419 --> 04:32:30,349
MATT: Funny thing. When that orb disappeared, and
he fell, so did him and the diamond.

3665
04:32:30,349 --> 04:32:31,591
LIAM: Windmill.

3666
04:32:31,591 --> 04:32:34,082
MATT: So he is not with the diamond. The diamond
is nowhere to be seen.

3667
04:32:34,082 --> 04:32:37,034
LAURA: That'll make someone's day, eventually.

3668
04:32:37,034 --> 04:32:38,806
MARISHA: It was more the principle of the matter.

3669
04:32:38,806 --> 04:32:48,599
ASHLEY: Well, I'm sad.

3670
04:32:48,599 --> 04:33:04,633
LAURA: Pike? If you send them on their way, think
about JB. That's all I ask.

3671
04:33:04,633 --> 04:33:17,377
ASHLEY: Okay. Ogden?

3672
04:33:17,377 --> 04:33:19,376
MATT: He's unconscious.

3673
04:33:19,376 --> 04:33:22,359
ASHLEY: You're not listening to me because you're
unconscious.

3674
04:33:22,359 --> 04:33:24,513
(laughter)

3675
04:33:24,513 --> 04:33:25,875
TRAVIS: Don't one of you people have the touch?

3676
04:33:25,875 --> 04:33:29,482
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over and backhand his
face.

3677
04:33:29,482 --> 04:33:30,807
MATT: Okay.

3678
04:33:30,807 --> 04:33:38,378
MATT: "I've, uh--" His glasses are gone. His eyes
that were once beady are now wide and he's like,

3679
04:33:38,378 --> 04:33:41,117
"Oh. Hi, Pike."

3680
04:33:41,117 --> 04:33:43,245
ASHLEY: Hi.

3681
04:33:43,245 --> 04:33:44,379
MATT: "Hello."

3682
04:33:44,379 --> 04:33:51,505
ASHLEY: Listen.

3683
04:33:51,505 --> 04:33:53,868
MATT: "Gotcha!"

3684
04:33:53,868 --> 04:34:10,021
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay. So this wrecked me. So here's
what we're going to do. I'm going to send you guys

3685
04:34:10,021 --> 04:34:25,677
on your way. I'm going to take out my purse of
money. I'm giving you all my money. Stop. Don't

3686
04:34:25,677 --> 04:34:31,483
say anything. I want you, and I want Astra, and I
want Johann to leave and I never want to see you

3687
04:34:31,483 --> 04:34:35,006
again. JB is going to stay here with me.

3688
04:34:35,006 --> 04:34:43,370
MATT: He glances over at JB, who's, right now--
head is down, just looking at the ground. You can

3689
04:34:43,370 --> 04:34:47,383
see a little bit of moonlight that's coming by,
you can see the wet streaks on her cheeks. He goes

3690
04:34:47,383 --> 04:34:53,425
"That's very, very fair. That's very kind, and
very fair."

3691
04:34:53,425 --> 04:34:58,730
ASHLEY: We're going to teach her things. I will
put her through school. And her and I together

3692
04:34:58,730 --> 04:35:08,837
will change the Trickfoot name. But if I ever see
any of you again, I will fucking kill you all.

3693
04:35:09,000 --> 04:35:27,941
MATT: "As you should! Right, understood loud and
clear, young Pike Trickfoot." He takes the coins.

3694
04:35:27,941 --> 04:35:39,502
"So. Sorry. And how do we get back?"

3695
04:35:39,502 --> 04:35:44,939
LAURA: You'll find your way. I pat them all down
and make sure they didn't steal anything from us

3696
04:35:44,939 --> 04:35:46,191
on the way out.

3697
04:35:46,191 --> 04:35:48,516
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

3698
04:35:48,516 --> 04:35:49,834
ASHLEY: Good call.

3699
04:35:49,834 --> 04:35:59,685
LAURA: Wish I remembered my number. 14.

3700
04:35:59,685 --> 04:36:09,264
MATT: 14. Okay. I mean, they're all pretty
prostrate at this point. Feeling through Ogden and

3701
04:36:09,264 --> 04:36:21,268
Astra and Johann, you find about 400 gold worth of
silverware. Various other coins.

3702
04:36:21,268 --> 04:36:23,300
ASHLEY: Bastards!

3703
04:36:23,300 --> 04:36:27,893
MATT: You find some random odds and ends from the
castle that have all been pocketed and hidden in

3704
04:36:27,893 --> 04:36:30,941
boots. Hidden in hidden pockets.

3705
04:36:30,941 --> 04:36:37,622
LAURA: What is it with people and our fucking
silverware? You can take the money! You can't have

3706
04:36:37,622 --> 04:36:42,257
the items! These all have very sentimental value,
including those fucking dresses you destroyed. You

3707
04:36:42,257 --> 04:36:43,469
little--

3708
04:36:43,469 --> 04:36:50,547
TALIESIN: And as a bonus, there is a diamond at
the bottom of the cliff, if you're feeling

3709
04:36:50,592 --> 04:36:51,992
nimble.

3710
04:36:51,992 --> 04:36:53,689
MARISHA: I release my spell.

3711
04:36:53,689 --> 04:37:00,959
MATT: Okay. Entanglement drops. Gets up. "Okay,
well. I guess we have a long journey ahead of us,

3712
04:37:00,959 --> 04:37:08,102
"isn't that right, Dad?" And Uncle Ogden is now
standing without the hunch and is like, "I believe

3713
04:37:08,102 --> 04:37:11,349
"so. I think we have quite the journey ahead of
us."

3714
04:37:11,349 --> 04:37:13,496
TRAVIS: We're not killing anything?

3715
04:37:13,496 --> 04:37:15,805
LAURA: Sinaeth, Grog. Sinaeth.

3716
04:37:15,805 --> 04:37:20,548
MARISHA: Where did Ogden's staff go when it got
jettisoned out of him?

3717
04:37:20,548 --> 04:37:25,750
MATT: It's about, maybe, 25 feet this way. It
clattered against the rocks here

3718
04:37:25,750 --> 04:37:26,909
and fell to the ground.

3719
04:37:26,909 --> 04:37:29,062
MARISHA: I'm going to go gather it real quick.

3720
04:37:29,062 --> 04:37:30,934
MATT: Okay, you go and grab it. It's the same
gnarled wood still--

3721
04:37:30,934 --> 04:37:32,752
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Detect Magic on it.

3722
04:37:32,752 --> 04:37:34,012
MATT: Okay.

3723
04:37:34,012 --> 04:37:37,900
MARISHA: No. I don't have that. I have Dispel
Magic. Hey, Tary?

3724
04:37:37,900 --> 04:37:40,227
SAM: Oi! What do you want?

3725
04:37:40,227 --> 04:37:45,624
MARISHA: Does this look like anything to you? Does
this look magical? Can you tell?

3726
04:37:45,624 --> 04:37:47,112
SAM: I will Identify it.

3727
04:37:47,112 --> 04:37:50,190
MATT: Okay. It is a Staff of Major Image.

3728
04:37:50,190 --> 04:37:54,102
SAM: Ooh! That seems useful.

3729
04:37:54,102 --> 04:37:56,152
MARISHA: Here you go, Tary!

3730
04:37:56,152 --> 04:38:01,831
SAM: Ooh! Thank you! This will help make up for
the 3500 gold

3731
04:38:01,831 --> 04:38:04,929
I spent on this fight!

3732
04:38:05,003 --> 04:38:06,906
(laughter)

3733
04:38:06,906 --> 04:38:15,204
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to Ogden. Give a
little-- When you make it down the hill, you will

3734
04:38:15,204 --> 04:38:21,024
find your cart outside the city limits in perfect
working order, searched for anything else you

3735
04:38:21,024 --> 04:38:26,304
might have tried to stash away from my city. I'd
also like to remind you that the Riflemen have

3736
04:38:26,304 --> 04:38:30,717
seen your faces up close, and the next time you
come anywhere near our castle,

3737
04:38:30,717 --> 04:38:33,171
you will be shot on sight.

3738
04:38:33,171 --> 04:38:38,327
MATT: "Read loud and clear, Percival."

3739
04:38:38,327 --> 04:38:46,594
TALIESIN: I release a low charge of Diplomacy
right into him. Just so we're clear.

3740
04:38:46,594 --> 04:38:50,603
MATT: (panting) "Crystal."

3741
04:38:50,603 --> 04:38:52,708
TALIESIN: Excellent.

3742
04:38:52,708 --> 04:39:07,139
MATT: "Well-- despite circumstances, and given
that there's no reason to be false, it strangely

3743
04:39:07,139 --> 04:39:13,337
"has been a pleasure to meet you all. And Pike,
it's good to see you doing so well for yourself.

3744
04:39:13,337 --> 04:39:14,722
"Come! We're leaving!"

3745
04:39:14,722 --> 04:39:15,954
LAURA: Oh, and Johann!

3746
04:39:15,954 --> 04:39:18,120
MATT: Johann's like, "Uh, yes?"

3747
04:39:18,120 --> 04:39:20,711
LAURA: Stay away from those sweets.

3748
04:39:20,711 --> 04:39:24,242
MATT: "All right?"

3749
04:39:24,242 --> 04:39:27,963
ASHLEY: There actually is a curse on our family.
It's called diabetes.

3750
04:39:27,963 --> 04:39:31,344
(laughter)

3751
04:39:31,344 --> 04:39:32,601
ASHLEY: So watch out.

3752
04:39:32,601 --> 04:39:33,898
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

3753
04:39:33,898 --> 04:39:34,721
MARISHA: There it is!

3754
04:39:34,721 --> 04:39:38,303
MATT: And with that, the rest of the Trickfoot
family begins to make their long, meandering way

3755
04:39:38,303 --> 04:39:43,576
down the mountainside, leaving you guys there.

3756
04:39:43,576 --> 04:39:47,253
TRAVIS: You dropped a grenade, man.

3757
04:39:47,253 --> 04:39:48,694
(laughing)

3758
04:39:48,694 --> 04:39:52,692
MATT: As you make your way back to Castle
Whitestone with JB, we'll pick up that next time,

3759
04:39:52,692 --> 04:39:58,727
as it's getting really late, and you can't really
beat a button like that on an episode. Jesus. All

3760
04:39:58,727 --> 04:40:02,663
right, guys. We're going to end tonight's session
there. Thank you so much for watching.

3761
04:40:02,673 --> 04:40:07,155
(laughter)

3762
04:40:07,212 --> 04:40:08,427
ASHLEY: Oh man!

3763
04:40:08,427 --> 04:40:10,077
LAURA: Assholes!

3764
04:40:10,077 --> 04:40:13,916
LIAM: And they were so tore up to hand over JB! It
was like Les Mis.

3765
04:40:13,916 --> 04:40:15,348
LAURA: I know! They didn't even give a shit!

3766
04:40:15,348 --> 04:40:20,899
LIAM: "What to do? What to say? Can you carry our
treasure away?"

3767
04:40:20,899 --> 04:40:25,576
ASHLEY: I was-- After the last game I was like, I
feel so bad I treated them so badly.

3768
04:40:25,576 --> 04:40:35,781
SAM: Matt is so good! You played us! Every time!
We're so stupid! He was rolling every time-- "Oh,

3769
04:40:35,781 --> 04:40:40,588
"he missed again! Oh! Wow, this guy can't roll real
good, can he?"

3770
04:40:40,588 --> 04:40:43,633
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fucking son of a bitch! You son
of a bitch!

3771
04:40:43,633 --> 04:40:44,834
SAM: We were so stupid!

3772
04:40:44,834 --> 04:40:51,401
TRAVIS: "Oh, he missed you with advantage? Yeah!
He misses you! What's his AC? 12? He misses you!"

3773
04:40:51,401 --> 04:40:55,691
MATT: Interesting note, all of the attacks that
didn't affect him were all the attacks that Ogden

3774
04:40:55,691 --> 04:40:57,205
couldn't see happen.

3775
04:40:57,264 --> 04:40:59,529
LAURA: Right?

3776
04:40:59,529 --> 04:41:01,416
TRAVIS: Were you even writing down damage?

3777
04:41:01,416 --> 04:41:03,213
MATT: I was! 'Cause I wanted to make it look
realistic.

3778
04:41:03,213 --> 04:41:05,399
SAM: Oh my God, this guy.

3779
04:41:05,399 --> 04:41:06,968
LIAM: You're a liar!

3780
04:41:06,968 --> 04:41:10,108
TALIESIN: How much damage did we do to your little
fucking marionette?

3781
04:41:10,108 --> 04:41:11,403
MATT: I don't know, a lot.

3782
04:41:11,403 --> 04:41:13,469
TRAVIS: "I wrote down numbers!"

3783
04:41:13,469 --> 04:41:16,985
MATT: I'm sure Critrolestats has a number of
damage that was dealt to the air.

3784
04:41:16,985 --> 04:41:19,485
TALIESIN: You were just doing the John Stewart
bullshit, like "Ah. Ah!"

3785
04:41:19,485 --> 04:41:21,094
MATT: I wrote them all down.

3786
04:41:21,094 --> 04:41:26,609
MARISHA: I'm like, this motherfucker has more hit
points than a fucking dragon. What the shit is

3787
04:41:26,609 --> 04:41:27,670
going on?

3788
04:41:27,670 --> 04:41:29,347
TALIESIN: Are we healing it? What the hell?

3789
04:41:29,347 --> 04:41:31,144
TRAVIS: Yes. Good investigate.

3790
04:41:31,144 --> 04:41:36,762
MATT: There was a little part of me-- a little
part of me that was wondering, because-- my little

3791
04:41:36,762 --> 04:41:43,341
hope was that Taryon was going to investigate, I
tell him. And then keep it to himself until

3792
04:41:43,341 --> 04:41:46,795
everything happened and they went off on their
own. And then as they were walking away be like,

3793
04:41:46,795 --> 04:41:48,643
"By the way, that wasn't fucking real."

3794
04:41:48,643 --> 04:41:51,397
(laughter)

3795
04:41:51,397 --> 04:41:52,671
MATT: I could totally see you doing that.

3796
04:41:52,671 --> 04:41:58,725
TALIESIN: Wow! That I could totally see playing
out. I completely believe that you would do that,

3797
04:41:58,725 --> 04:41:59,987
you son-of-a-bitch.

3798
04:41:59,987 --> 04:42:03,014
SAM: I-- How am I getting a "son-of-a-bitch"? He's
the son-of-a-bitch!

3799
04:42:03,014 --> 04:42:05,049
(laughter)

3800
04:42:05,049 --> 04:42:10,350
MATT: Anyway, guys, have a wonderful night. Rest
well, tomorrow's another day. Pick up, move on.

3801
04:42:10,350 --> 04:42:12,581
ASHLEY: We all have work early, so we're in the
same boat.

3802
04:42:12,581 --> 04:42:16,515
MATT: Love you all very much. Thanks for coming
along with us. And is it Thursday yet?

3803
04:42:16,515 --> 04:42:19,142
Have a good night.

3804
04:42:19,142 --> 04:48:49,056
