1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,741
MATT: -- tonight's episode of Critical Role, where
a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:10,669
and play Dungeons and Dragons. We are down one
Sam, unfortunately, tonight, so Scanlan will be

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:20,335
Jaeger-piloted by Keyleth and Percy over there,
and Pike is still in New York, but in trade, we do

4
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:22,642
have Rothfuss joining us this week via Skype.

5
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:24,097
(cheering)

6
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:28,244
MATT: To continue the journey of Kerrek along with
these crazy kids.

7
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:30,562
So thank you for joining us, Patrick.

8
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,645
LIAM: Look at his beautiful office and all his
beautiful owlbears.

9
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:35,103
MARISHA: So many owlbears!

10
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:40,652
MATT: It's beautiful. Cool, so before we get into
the game tonight, let's go ahead and do our

11
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:46,410
announcements. First and foremost, we are starting
with our first official sponsorship of the year

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:54,221
with the return of Lootcrate. Thank you so much
for being amazing supporters of the show and we're

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,550
excited to get started. Liam, you wanted to talk
about this one?

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,875
LIAM: Oh my gosh, Sam is not here and I got asked
to do something ten minutes ago. This is gonna be

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:08,315
so good. In Sam and Lootcrate's honor, I have
written a limerick. I think you'll all approve.

16
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:13,469
And then I'll tell you a little bit about
Lootcrate, but first, some Irish poetry. Sam's

17
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:19,190
style is not what you'd call quaint, let's be
honest, my man is no saint, but Lootcrate is

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,007
happy, his pitch plans are snappy, singing songs
about fisting and taint.

19
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,913
(laughter)

20
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:33,455
LIAM: Okay! So Lootcrate, the January theme is not
'taint' or 'fisting', it's 'origins'. The brands

21
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:40,726
are Superman, Marvel, TMNT, Nintendo, I know
everyone here's familiar. The cutoff-- you have to

22
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,244
order now, the cutoff is 9PM tonight.

23
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:44,553
MATT: 9PM tonight.

24
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:50,449
LIAM: So you gotta go get got, and you want to go
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Not critrole, but

25
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:55,933
lootcrate.com/criticalrole. And the promo code is
'criticalrole', one word,

26
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,647
for 10% off your first month.

27
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,047
MATT: Rockin'.

28
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:01,373
LIAM: Also taint.

29
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:04,496
LAURA: Thank you, Lootcrate. We're glad to have
you back.

30
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:09,005
MATT: We can't talk about the taint theme. That
doesn't happen until April.

31
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:13,028
LAURA: So excited about it, though. Just so
excited.

32
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,416
LIAM: There are some exclusives.

33
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:22,614
MATT: There are some inclusives. So anyway. I also
wanted to give a shout-out to Blue Mics, Blue

34
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:27,525
Microphones, they have been fantastic and sent us
a bunch of new equipment here to start upgrading

35
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:32,998
the audio quality of our fantastic show here and
us personally, as voice actors, I myself have used

36
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:39,080
Blues for quite a long time for home auditions and
I'm hoping that the one that now sits before me

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,880
will give you a little bit of a better boost from
my usual audio. So thank you guys so much, Blue

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,960
Mics, for helping support us here. If you're
interested at all in checking out their awesome

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,052
audio equipment, you can go to them at
bluemic.com. That's B-L-U-E-M-I-C.com.

40
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,252
Thank you guys.

41
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,569
TALIESIN: I cannot say enough good stuff.

42
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,022
MATT: Laura, you wanted to talk about stuff?

43
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,986
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Okay, okay, okay, I'll stop
rolling for a second, because we have these new

44
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,568
things in the store, and they're socks.

45
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,622
(gasping)

46
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:15,993
LAURA: I know, I know, I put 'em in front of
everybody. They don't smell yet, 'cause nobody's

47
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:20,949
worn them. They should be in the store right now.
They say 'how do you want to do this?' and they've

48
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,429
got the logo on it, and if they do well, then
maybe we'll think about releasing some Sox Machina

49
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:34,703
in all the different characters. I know, it's
exciting, it's fun. And also, the dice are still

50
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:39,216
in the works, those should be coming up soon,
hopefully by this month, maybe next month, but

51
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:44,513
they will be back in the store. We have pins, we
have bracelets, limited stock of those are back in

52
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:48,524
the store, too, so. That's so exciting. And all
the other things that I've been announcing every

53
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:51,379
week because, you know, we're just so on top of
it, no big deal.

54
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,129
(laughter)

55
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,292
TRAVIS: Can we keep these?

56
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,583
LAURA: Yeah, no, these are for us.

57
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,395
TRAVIS: Yay! These will stink in a week.

58
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:02,664
MATT: Please bring them back next week and show
us.

59
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:06,233
LAURA: Can I just tell everybody how much I miss
having you next to me, boo?

60
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,504
MARISHA: Aww.

61
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,482
LAURA: I'm sad you're not over here.

62
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,595
TRAVIS: Oh, we're not in character yet, right? I
miss you too.

63
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:21,072
MATT: Aww. Stop it. Next thing I want to announce
is there's a convention coming up in February

64
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:28,954
called Anime Milwaukee, February 17-19, in which
me, Marisha, Travis, and Laura will be in

65
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:34,513
attendance as guests. So come join us for an
awesome Critical Role panel, we'll have signings

66
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:38,235
throughout the weekend, our other panels about
voiceover and other elements of chaos. So if

67
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:41,559
you're in that area, please come and say hi. Bring
things for us to sign.

68
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:45,815
TRAVIS: Yeah, bring a bathing suit, I hear there's
a pool party on Saturdays in the

69
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,591
negative-two-degree weather.

70
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,185
LAURA: Oh, god. Is it really that cold?

71
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,722
TRAVIS: I don't know. It's Milwaukee.

72
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:55,337
MARISHA: Yeah, it's by the lake, too, you got that
lake-effect air.

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:05:03,750
MATT: Dress warm, just in case. Anything else
anyone wishes to discuss or mention? Patrick,

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,682
anything you wanna mention?

75
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:09,822
PATRICK: You guys are coming to my state? You're
gonna be in Wisconsin? When's that?

76
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:12,451
MATT: That is February 17-19.

77
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,889
TRAVIS: But we're not gonna see you.

78
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,875
(laughter)

79
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,387
PATRICK: You act like you have a choice.

80
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,496
(laughter)

81
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,051
MATT: So yeah. Come see us!

82
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:28,300
PATRICK: I'll see, I'll check my calendar to see,
that'll be a short trip if you're just down in

83
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,426
Milwaukee.

84
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,153
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Patrick dinner.

85
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,249
PATRICK: That would be awesome.

86
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:39,898
MATT: So look for a bearded fellow with sunglasses
and a hoodie at the convention. Well, cool. Thank

87
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:44,151
you guys so much. Now that our announcements are
done, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's

88
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:47,357
episode of Critical Role.

89
00:05:47,357 --> 00:06:46,464
[no audio]

90
00:06:46,464 --> 00:07:17,585
[dramatic music]

91
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:26,953
MATT: And welcome back. (laughs) Yeah, that was a
great countdown. So, to bring us into the story,

92
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:32,831
and get you guys up to speed, the adventuring
group of Vox Machina had been battling the Chroma

93
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:36,561
Conclave, a collection of ancient chromatic
dragons that had terrorized the Tal'Dorei

94
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:42,213
countryside, ruined a number of the villages and
cities, their leader, Thordak the Cinderking,

95
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:49,119
lording over the capital city of Emon for a number
of weeks at this point. In order to prepare

96
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:52,932
themselves for this battle, they have traversed
the planes and all across the world to acquire

97
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:58,874
Vestiges of Divergence, these powerful artifacts,
and upon acquiring them and gathering allies, they

98
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:02,876
made an assault, with the help of these allies,
upon the city of Emon, defeated Thordak the

99
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:07,909
Cinderking, and, after making an alliance with one
of these Conclave members, Raishan, the Diseased

100
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:13,442
Deceiver, to aid them in this battle, they ended
up battling Raishan as well within Thordak's lair

101
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:20,491
beneath the city. Raishan nearly annihilated the
entirety of the group Vox Machina, kept at bay

102
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:26,391
only by them summoning one of their allies, J'mon
Sa Ord, the powerful brass dragon and secret

103
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:32,148
leader of the city of Ank'harel. Enough of a
threat to push her away, Raishan took the corpse

104
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:37,490
of Thordak, apparently via teleportation, as well
as two of the eggs that remained in the lair, and

105
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,951
vanished. Upon wrestling your way outside of the
lair itself, you came upon a number of allies who

106
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:50,169
had fought their way to the center of the city, as
well as Patrick's character Kerrek, who had

107
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:56,254
brought a number of his ragtag adventurers from
the city of Westruun to aid. Kerrek joined you in

108
00:08:56,254 --> 00:09:00,845
your return to Whitestone, and has now agreed to
aid you in your search for the current whereabouts

109
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:08,463
of Raishan. Through the use of some rather rapid
scry magic and the dragon's spent capability to

110
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:13,514
defend against it at the time, you found the
location of Raishan, apparently a distant island

111
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:21,091
to the far south in the Lucidian Ocean, one that
once was the lair of Thordak before he was sealed,

112
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:29,807
and before that, apparently belonged to a
necromancer named Opash. You then spent the

113
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:33,988
evening in Whitestone-- or, I guess, the day,
since you slept through the day-- in Whitestone,

114
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:39,316
preparing to rest for a coming conflict, giving
chase to Raishan in hopes of stopping whatever her

115
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:47,290
plans are before they come to fruition. So. That
is when we dive back in. So all of you guys have

116
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,312
had a full night's rest, you're back up to your
full hit points, you regain half of your spent hit

117
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:59,758
dice. Spells are back. I know we had a few
characters level. We had Scanlan level, Percy

118
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,494
levelled, and Pike levelled.

119
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:07,119
LAURA: So we're just gonna choose an eighth-level
for Pike, but it won't stick if she wants to not

120
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,746
have that be it, right?

121
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:14,237
MATT: Yeah. Sure. It's fine, as a cleric, you have
access to all the cleric spells.

122
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,729
LAURA: Oh, so she doesn't have to choose one like
a ranger?

123
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:21,820
MATT: No, no, no. That's kind of the benefits of
the cleric and the wizard, is they have a larger

124
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,267
breadth of spells, druids as well.

125
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,636
LAURA: Oh, that's great. Well, never mind!

126
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:28,560
LIAM: We're gonna pick Power Word Kill Green
Dragon.

127
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,857
LAURA: Yeah, Power Word Kill Green Dragon for her
eighth-level spell.

128
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,665
MATT: She's taking Power Word Kill?

129
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:34,926
LIAM: Green Dragon.

130
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,256
LAURA: Specifically.

131
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,488
MARISHA: Can she do that?

132
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,642
LAURA: No, no.

133
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,659
MARISHA: Okay. I was just like, is that allowed?

134
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:44,157
LIAM: You don't know.

135
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:47,484
MARISHA: All right. All right.

136
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:53,338
MATT: So. If you guys wanna get your-- any
attunement changes you want to situate for the

137
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:56,788
coming party company move.

138
00:10:56,788 --> 00:11:06,032
LIAM: Yeah. I would like my boots back, and I've
been sort of dreading this moment. Can I have my

139
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,343
boots back?

140
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:11,580
LAURA: They look so good on me. Have you noticed?

141
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,672
LIAM: It's all I've noticed for the last 24 hours
when we were fighting. I mean, we probably

142
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,821
would've killed her yesterday, but I was so
distracted by how good

143
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,824
you looked in the boots, yeah.

144
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,094
LAURA: I know, I know.

145
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:24,871
LIAM: Yeah.

146
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,100
LAURA: I mean, like, really good.

147
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,527
LIAM: Strategically, I think I can actually do
more, and I think I'm more likely to get a little

148
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:31,981
more bang for my buck out of them.

149
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:36,277
LAURA: Oh, really? Strategically, you can do more
than me?

150
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:40,435
LIAM: Never mind. I'll use the sword--

151
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,519
LAURA: No, no, no, I'll give them to you, I'll
give them to you.

152
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,813
LIAM: That was as painful as I imagined it would
be.

153
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:49,032
TRAVIS: It could've been worse.

154
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:52,901
LIAM: Yes, it could've been. Percy, would you like
this sword back?

155
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,489
TALIESIN: You know...

156
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,327
LIAM: Or anybody. Yeah, the sword.

157
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,855
LAURA: It's the Dragonkilling sword.

158
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:06,454
LIAM: I just, I'm better when I'm maneuverable,
and I feel like I'm gonna get one swing and a miss

159
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,164
and it go to waste.

160
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:11,177
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Who needs it? Can anybody take
it?

161
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,699
TALIESIN: I will admit, if I get within striking
distance, I'm probably--

162
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,749
TRAVIS: Can I see it?

163
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:19,516
LIAM: Sure you can. Here's the handle.

164
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:23,143
MARISHA: Proper handling techniques.

165
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:30,138
TRAVIS: What, really? (gasps) I'll have it.

166
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:33,613
LAURA: Should I do stealth cloak or should I do--

167
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:37,505
MATT: You guys have also taken some time to
inspect the other items that you received from the

168
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,762
treasure hoard.

169
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:41,399
LAURA: Get me out of this bench situation!

170
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,867
MARISHA: Gimme those, gimme those, gimme those
boots.

171
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:48,810
MATT: Boots to Keyleth, and this to whoever, the
hammer.

172
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,977
TRAVIS: The hammer. There's a hammer?

173
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:53,508
MATT: It's a warhammer.

174
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:56,731
TRAVIS: What? Who found a warhammer? I was
asleep.

175
00:12:56,731 --> 00:13:01,397
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, I'll pass it over to you.
I'm not even going to read it, Keyleth.

176
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,091
TALIESIN: Chapter one.

177
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:10,957
LAURA: Okay, wait. The Dwarven Thrower, this is
the warhammer. Okay. You gain a +3 attack bonus,

178
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:19,510
bonus to attack and damage rolls. It has a thrown
property. Normal range of 20 feet and a long range

179
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,949
of 60 feet, Grog. When you hit with a ranged
attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8

180
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:30,079
damage or, if the target is Giant, which a dragon
is, 2d8 damage.

181
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,962
MATT: Like an actual giant.

182
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:36,718
LAURA: Oh, 'is a giant'. Never mind. Immediately
after the attack,

183
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,971
the weapon flies back to your hand.

184
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:40,939
LIAM: Another one of those secrets she was telling
me about.

185
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:45,847
MATT: Yeah, it's Thor-hammerish. Does require
attunement by a dwarf.

186
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:50,433
TRAVIS: What if I've got a dwarvish beard?

187
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:58,152
MATT: If you have the Belt of Dwarvenkind attuned,
you can attune to the hammer as well. But only

188
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:04,372
under that condition. If you unattune the belt,
you have to unattune the hammer.

189
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:07,033
LIAM: And you have to give Matt $20.

190
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,020
TRAVIS: I'm so happy right now.

191
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,396
MATT: Yes, that as well. I forgot that on the
card.

192
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,597
LAURA: Kerrek, are you secretly a dwarf?

193
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:20,238
PATRICK: I... no, though the similarity is
notable.

194
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:23,240
(laughter)

195
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,047
LIAM: I noticed you haven't actually given me the
boots back, and I just wanted to remind you--

196
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:32,497
LAURA: Oh my god, let me find the fucking piece of
paper. Jeez.

197
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,862
LIAM: It's very important. I'm also going-- oh,
you go.

198
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:41,378
MARISHA: Also, these boots may be good for our
wonderful cleric. These are Boots of Elvenkind.

199
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:46,450
While you wear these boots, your steps make no
sound, regardless of the surface you are moving

200
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:52,714
across. You also have advantage on dexterity
stealth checks that rely on moving silently.

201
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:58,264
LAURA: Oh my gosh, but I don't know what else Pike
has attuned on her.

202
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,995
MATT: Well, that one I don't think requires
attunement.

203
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:07,664
LAURA: (gasps) Pass 'em over, Pike will wear them!
They don't need attune? Wow, I'll write them down

204
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:08,961
on her sheet.

205
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:12,397
MATT: But she will not have her Boots of
Levitation. Or no, she will not have her

206
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,319
Sprinter's Boots. Sprinter's Boots will be
replaced by those.

207
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:20,549
LIAM: Well, you know, what are the chances that
she's gonna need to bolt? Probably more than sneak

208
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,387
around. Probably?

209
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,434
MATT: It's a choice to make.

210
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:29,412
LAURA: Okay, here's a question: can she have the
boots on and then right before the battle put on

211
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:30,831
the Sprinter's Boots?

212
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,871
MATT: Sprinter's Boots do require attunement.

213
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,247
LAURA: And it's not like you can attune them and
then take them off?

214
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,707
MATT: I'll have to double-check the card from her.
I don't know if they do.

215
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:41,457
MARISHA: Sprinter's Boots are pretty clutch for
Pike.

216
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,941
LAURA: Yeah, they're pretty clutch, especially
after the last time.

217
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,027
LIAM: We're going to brawl.

218
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:49,228
LAURA: But we're going stealthy, probably,
before--

219
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:56,800
MATT: It's up to you. The process of a giant,
armored gnome to change out her boots is gonna

220
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,455
be-- it's not like a quick, it's not pressing the
'x' button in your inventory.

221
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:03,028
LIAM: It's like changing from one pair of ski
boots into another pair of ski boots.

222
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,618
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

223
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,320
(laughter)

224
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,598
MATT: So be mindful of that.

225
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:11,410
LIAM: All right. Minor thing, I'm going to attune
the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic.

226
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,010
MATT: To necrotic. Okay.

227
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,507
MARISHA: Well, then, how's your stealth, Percy?

228
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,610
TALIESIN: I have spider-boots.

229
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,429
MARISHA: Oh, you have spider-boots. What about
you, Grog?

230
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:24,297
TRAVIS: Huh? What was the question? Sorry, I'm
drooling all over this--

231
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:29,123
LAURA: Do you mind-- can I put 'em on for now?
Since I gave him back his boots. Is that okay?

232
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,306
MARISHA: Yeah, my stealth is pretty all right.

233
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,248
TALIESIN: He's got leaping boots.

234
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,268
LIAM: Is that a Thor hammer, is that thing?

235
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:40,432
TRAVIS: It's pretty fucking close. Apparently I
throw it, it comes right back to my hand. If I had

236
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,794
Frenzied Rage and three attacks, would it go
(whack whack whack) like a giant yo-yo?

237
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,161
MATT: Technically yes?

238
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,498
TRAVIS: (hyperventilates) I'm taking this one.

239
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:49,689
TALIESIN: I get it.

240
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,062
LIAM: How far can you throw that thing?

241
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,127
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

242
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:57,678
MATT: Well, it's 20 feet and then 60 feet is the
second range increment, so if it's longer than 20

243
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,685
feet, your attacks are at disadvantage.

244
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,496
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

245
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,689
MATT: But you can still attack.

246
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,827
TRAVIS: What if I did Reckless Attack?

247
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:05,509
MATT: Then it would be no more roll, and then
everyone gets advantage against you.

248
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,192
TRAVIS: I love you right now. If these two tables
weren't in our way...

249
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,675
MATT: Love the dice that rolled that treasure
hoard.

250
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:16,306
LIAM: Ugh, what's all over the bottom of the table
after the show?

251
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:17,621
TRAVIS: Mayonnaise.

252
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,858
MATT: Is there anybody else that wanted to--

253
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:22,051
TRAVIS: I would like to attune to this.

254
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:23,485
MATT: To the Dwarven Thrower?

255
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:24,859
TRAVIS: Yes. Not the Blood Axe.

256
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,855
MATT: Okay, so the Blood Axe goes away. Dwarven
Thrower's out.

257
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,559
TALIESIN: Cabal's, Dragonslayer, Animus.

258
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,692
MATT: So, just so you're aware, the dice roll on
that is a d8 to do damage, as opposed to a d12.

259
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:41,319
LAURA: Oh. That doesn't sound as cool.

260
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,167
TRAVIS: I must think.

261
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,485
MARISHA: I'm gonna do my circlet, my antlers, as
always, Ring of Protection, Spire of Conflux.

262
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,677
MATT: Okay.

263
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:56,110
PATRICK: Just to chime in, out of character, I
know we picked up the dancing sword, which could

264
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,846
act as an autonomous fighting thing, but I don't
know who has that or who

265
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,625
has slots available to attune.

266
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,412
MATT: That is-- Grog has that, actually.

267
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,932
LAURA: Grog has every weapon ever.

268
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:10,649
MARISHA: Is it an attunement thing?

269
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,155
MATT: You have to attune to it, yeah.

270
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,255
LIAM: You're a Fallout character.

271
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:19,843
MATT: But yes, Grog does have the sword.

272
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:25,059
MARISHA: Do you have an extra spot, Kerr? To
attune?

273
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:31,591
PATRICK: I'm gonna show my age, here. You know, I
have only occasionally done 5th edition, back in

274
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,127
the day when I got used to playing, we never attuned our
weapons.

275
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:38,928
MATT: Yeah, you only have two things attuned. You
do, you can.

276
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:45,508
PATRICK: So I'm relatively easy in terms of what
magic items. I could have it and set it loose at

277
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,727
the beginning of combat, if nobody else can.

278
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,235
TRAVIS: Okay.

279
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:55,899
MATT: So Grog pulls the sword out from the Bag of
Holding, and as he reaches and extends it towards

280
00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:01,342
you, you feel this sudden almost like a sudden
burst of headache at the back of your mind, and

281
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:06,387
you stop for a second, Grog, and you look at the
blade. And there across the metallic sheen of this

282
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:11,322
gorgeous scimitar, you see this image begin to
seep through and look at you. It's this

283
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,967
female-like face, very faint, a reflection--

284
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,288
TRAVIS: Female setting!

285
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:20,103
MATT: But the teeth are fanged, and you see what
looks to be almost like a swirl of snakes around

286
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:25,343
the outside. At that moment, you feel that burst
of headache in the back of your head grow

287
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:29,692
extremely strong, and you drop the blade out of
your hand, and you guys watch as Grog falls to his

288
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:35,768
knees, just clutching the sides of his head. The
sword, as it hits the ground, it clacks. The blade

289
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:43,076
almost immediately rusts and turns into a dark,
dull metal. The gems crack and turn to dust, and

290
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,573
what now lies there is an inert weapon.

291
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:48,219
LAURA: What the fuck?

292
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,895
LIAM: What did you do?

293
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,571
MARISHA: Grog?

294
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,946
TRAVIS: Ow.

295
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:55,906
(laughter)

296
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:58,581
LAURA: Oh no, did it turn you really, really,
really stupid?

297
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,629
TRAVIS: That really hurt, and it's still hurting.

298
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:03,852
MARISHA: Grog, how many fingers am I holding up?

299
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:04,986
TRAVIS: Square.

300
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,058
TALIESIN: Well, he's fine.

301
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:12,001
LIAM: That magic sword bit me. That really hurt.

302
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,545
TRAVIS: What happened?

303
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:20,869
LAURA: Is it just because it's only meant for
you?

304
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,442
LIAM: Kerrek, do you still want it?

305
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,270
(laughter)

306
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:31,508
PATRICK: Do I have any idea, like, was this thing
rejecting me or pissed

307
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:34,873
that Grog was abandoning it?

308
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:38,624
MATT: You get the sense, just 'cause you've seen a
few things like this, that this was actually an

309
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:44,165
inherent curse within the blade, and it just took
a moment to dig itself into Grog.

310
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,952
TRAVIS: Oh no.

311
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:50,937
MATT: But the source of the curse is expended, and
Grog, you are permanently at -2 to all of your

312
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:54,188
saving throws. Correcting my mistake from the card
last session.

313
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,557
LAURA: Oh, shit!

314
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,377
MARISHA: This is the Deck of Many Things?

315
00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:01,479
MATT: This was me completely either misreading or
mishearing it last time, as the internet let me

316
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,935
know that was the card drawn, I want to make sure
that we stick to what was drawn.

317
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:07,218
TRAVIS: I don't have a problem with that, I do
have a problem with the headache. Can we maybe

318
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,473
bargain to get the headache removed? 'Cause I'm
really--

319
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:11,936
TALIESIN: I have Tylenol, but it requires
attunement.

320
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,787
(laughter)

321
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:16,807
TRAVIS: I need BC Powder.

322
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,753
MATT: I think Grog has a way to get rid of
headaches.

323
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:22,400
LIAM: Can I also say, no one's gonna ever try to
get away with anything here, because we know we're

324
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:28,051
being watched-- people are watching like hawks.
Everything's going to be seen.

325
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:32,673
MARISHA: So -2 to all of his saving throws?

326
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:33,740
MATT: Yes.

327
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,736
MARISHA: Permanently?

328
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:37,284
MATT: Well, until a god takes it away.

329
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:44,942
LAURA: A god? No, go talk to the Raven Queen or
somebody. Sarenrae! (gasps) Maybe she can Greater

330
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:48,315
Restoration, if Pike realizes what it is.

331
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:53,217
TRAVIS: Stupid sword. Jeez, me and swords. Just
really not doing well.

332
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:55,627
LIAM: Pike, can you take a look at your buddy?

333
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:58,779
LAURA: Well, I don't know if I know that
anything's wrong with him.

334
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,612
Grog, do you have a headache?

335
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:08,428
MATT: Grog is clutching the side of his head. Pike
just came up to you and asked you a question.

336
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,756
TRAVIS: What'd she say?

337
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:10,862
LAURA: Do you have a headache?

338
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,923
TRAVIS: I do. Do you have anything to help with
it?

339
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:19,072
LAURA: Well, I can maybe do like a Cure Wounds,
or--

340
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:23,580
TRAVIS: I'm not wounded, it's just a headache. Do
you have Cure Headache?

341
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,968
LAURA: I don't think so, but I can pray to
Sarenrae if it would help?

342
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:32,803
TRAVIS: I don't know, it's out of my league. I
mean, maybe, yeah.

343
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:37,469
LAURA: Can I-- is there anything I have?

344
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,461
MATT: What do you want to try?

345
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:44,312
MARISHA: Pike is just universally cute. She's like
a kigurumi, if you wear it, you're just

346
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,418
automatically cute.

347
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:46,816
LAURA: Just insta-cute.

348
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:48,003
MATT: It's true.

349
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:54,777
LAURA: Would I know what to do? Would she know
what to do to try to help him at all?

350
00:22:54,777 --> 00:23:00,220
MATT: If it's a curse, I mean, there are a few
things that can usually take care of a regular

351
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,273
curse, but she doesn't understand the nature of
this curse.

352
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:10,772
LAURA: Okay. I can try to do a-- I don't know what
level Greater Restoration is.

353
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,088
MATT: It's a 5th-level.

354
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:14,330
TRAVIS: It's only a headache. I'll be fine.

355
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,616
LAURA: Are you sure, Grog?

356
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,573
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all just healed, I'm fine.

357
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:21,292
LAURA: Okay. Let me know if you need anything,
though.

358
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,270
TRAVIS: All right, yeah, I will. Thank you, Pike.

359
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,483
PATRICK: Coming into this fight down two on all
saves...

360
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:32,964
TRAVIS: We're gonna kick some ass. Oh, down two.
That's...

361
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:37,218
TALIESIN: Do we have anything sitting around
that's not attuned, though--

362
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:47,399
LIAM: Pike got that cloak that fucking Hotis glued
to my flesh off. That's I think what she did.

363
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:55,508
MARISHA: Grog, if you want, also, you can have my
Ring of Protection, which is a Ring of Protection

364
00:23:55,508 --> 00:24:02,144
+2, and it gives you +2 to AC and to all your
saving throws. I was gonna wear it, but I could

365
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:04,960
wear the Cloak of Displacement instead.

366
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,818
TRAVIS: I'm not a real big jewelry fan. Do I have
to attune to it?

367
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:08,892
MARISHA: Yeah.

368
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:10,263
TRAVIS: Nah, I don't want it.

369
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:11,588
MARISHA: Okay.

370
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:17,326
TRAVIS: Thank you, though, Keyleth, that's very
sweet.

371
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:25,629
MARISHA: You're welcome. It's a little bit of a
girly ring, so I understand. Well, you're full on

372
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,858
attunements, right? You're full up?

373
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:30,806
LAURA: Pike's gonna try to do Greater Restoration
on Grog.

374
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:36,684
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are finishing this
conversation, Grog and Keyleth, Pike walks up and

375
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:47,363
holds her gauntlet out, her giant, awesome,
monster-ogre gauntlet. As it begins to suddenly

376
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:52,671
emit this bright white vibrant glow, she touches
the front of your forehead, beckoning you to bend

377
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:57,045
down to try and get rid of the headache. You watch
as the healing energy surges through your body

378
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:02,588
from head to toe, and as it passes through you,
the light fades, the spell is spent-- that's a

379
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,674
5th-level spell she used-- and the headache
remains.

380
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:07,254
(groaning)

381
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:09,188
TRAVIS: Did it do anything for my gas?

382
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:13,628
MATT: There is no divine magic that can do
anything about that either, Grog.

383
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:14,627
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

384
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:21,053
LAURA: It was worth a try, though, because that
would've been helpful.

385
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:28,803
TALIESIN: I cannot find my card for my Ring of
Lightning Resistance. It seems to have vanished.

386
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:32,045
TRAVIS: I don't know where it would have gone.

387
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:34,748
TALIESIN: Do we have anything else equipped that
we can--

388
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:40,272
LAURA: I didn't say it the last time, but
Trinket's out of the necklace, and he healed

389
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,743
overnight, 'cause he's low too.

390
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:50,603
PATRICK: Actually, you know, Kerrek is kind of
standing around, buffing a little bit of the rust

391
00:25:50,603 --> 00:26:04,852
out of his off-the-rack chainmail. He's trying not
to look like that kid who showed up at the rich

392
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:06,176
kids' party.

393
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:08,880
(laughter)

394
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,983
PATRICK: Out of character, I will say, if anyone
has anything that they're not using in terms of--

395
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,337
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we do!

396
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:20,933
PATRICK: I'm reasonably geared up, I'll be able to
go in and hit.

397
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:26,705
TALIESIN: Are you wearing armor?

398
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,749
MATT: He has chainmail.

399
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:31,017
TALIESIN: Okay, so the Bracers of Defense wouldn't
work.

400
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:35,053
MARISHA: Yeah, would the cloak work with armor,
right? It wouldn't replace his armor, a cloak?

401
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,736
MATT: No, the cloak can go over armor.

402
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:42,601
MARISHA: Are you okay with that, Vax? Kerr, we
have this Cloak of Displacement that's pretty

403
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,523
awesome, if you want to wear it.

404
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:48,894
LIAM: Yeah, it's made from the flesh of a flying
manta ray-type thing, and it makes you really hard

405
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:51,340
to hit, and this is a loaner--

406
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,327
MATT: It's actually made from the flesh of a
displacer beast.

407
00:26:53,327 --> 00:27:01,099
LIAM: I know that, I know. I also have a very
precious ring which I would love to have back from

408
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:05,260
you once we've killed this dragon, but you will
not be seen if you wear it.

409
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,963
PATRICK: I would put that to good use in the
coming fight.

410
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,751
MARISHA: Okay. I take the cloak and I throw it
over him. You gonna tweet it to him? Or text it to

411
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,221
him? Whatever.

412
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:21,422
LIAM: And I slap the ring down into his palm.

413
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,328
MARISHA: Do you have a picture of the ring?

414
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,774
LIAM: A picture of the ring?

415
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:26,486
LAURA: It's a Ring of Invisibility?

416
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,403
MARISHA: Do you have a thing? No?

417
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,006
LIAM: Yes, I have a thing.

418
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:32,092
LAURA: Just a legendary ring.

419
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:47,637
MATT: Just a legendary ring like you do. Just
note, with the Ring of Invisibility, you remain

420
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:52,238
invisible until the ring is removed, until you
attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus

421
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,021
action to become visible again.

422
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:56,726
LIAM: If anyone has anything better to give him,
we could do that.

423
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:59,468
LAURA: No, that's really good. That's a badass
ring.

424
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:07,667
LIAM: Hey, Siri, remind me to ask Patrick Rothfuss
for my Ring of Invisibility back once the dragon

425
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:12,315
is dead. We're good.

426
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,679
MATT: All right, there you go. Thank you, Siri.

427
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,830
(laughter)

428
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,083
TRAVIS: Assisting D&D games since 2000-something.

429
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,813
MATT: All right. So. What else do you guys want to
prepare, if anything, as you wake up, come to

430
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:23,942
consciousness--

431
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,751
LAURA: We should have a Heroes' Feast.

432
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,420
MARISHA: Yes, we should.

433
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,803
LAURA: Is there anybody that could do a Heroes'
Feast?

434
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,690
MARISHA: Pike, how are you looking on Feasts?

435
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,865
MATT: I mean, if Pike wants to prepare a Heroes'
Feast, Pike can cast it.

436
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:39,943
MARISHA: Can Gilmore?

437
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:41,735
LIAM: That was a one-time thing.

438
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:46,650
MATT: Gilmore had a few items that basically
turned into a Heroes' Feast,

439
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,807
but he lost his shop.

440
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:55,455
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Pike can do another--
what level is that?

441
00:28:55,455 --> 00:29:02,124
MATT: Heroes' Feast. It is, I believe, 6th-level,
I think. Yes, 6th-level.

442
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:07,258
TRAVIS: Why're we having a Feast? Are we going to
fight something?

443
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:10,596
TALIESIN: It's breakfast. It's the most important
meal of the day.

444
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,299
TRAVIS: That's right. I feel terrible for not
realizing that.

445
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,345
LAURA: Okay, so we all have Heroes' Feast.

446
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:24,849
MATT: All right, so. Mark your diamond that you
recently found in the hoard, marked off, as Pike

447
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:29,764
prepares a long wooden table, summoned through
divine magic, that contains a fantastic meal of

448
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:36,633
all the classic Westruun comfort foods, instilled
with the power and guidance of Sarenrae. As you

449
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:44,207
spend the additional hour to eat and drink and
gain the effect of the spell, you become immune to

450
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:49,558
poison, immune to fear, and you all get an
additional 2d10 to your maximum hit points, if you

451
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,343
want to roll that, Laura.

452
00:29:51,343 --> 00:29:52,627
LAURA: For Pike?

453
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:56,842
MATT: Yes. Well, this is for everybody. Everybody
gets this amount.

454
00:29:56,842 --> 00:30:01,513
LAURA: Oh, that's not bad, that's not bad. That's
a 15 added for everybody.

455
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,822
MATT: So everybody gets 15 additional hit points.

456
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:12,553
MARISHA: And I'm assuming Trinket is eating and
Allura is eating?

457
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:21,365
MATT: It can feed up to 12 people, so yes. That
would be Kerr as well, and Allura, and Kima.

458
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:25,650
TALIESIN: We get advantage on what saves?

459
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,780
LAURA: Fear and poison.

460
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,141
MATT: Well, you're immune to fear and immune to
poison.

461
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,713
TALIESIN: We don't get advantage?

462
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,139
LAURA: Advantage on wisdom.

463
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:38,388
MATT: Wisdom saving throws. All righty.

464
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:47,153
LAURA: And I attuned-- by the way, my Bracers of
Archery are attuned again.

465
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:51,774
MATT: You reattuned to your Bracers of Archery?
Cool. All righty. So.

466
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:54,372
MARISHA: Should I do a Scrying Eye, see if I can
still find Raishan?

467
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:58,934
LAURA: Yeah, but what should you scry on? Can you
scry on Thordak's body or something? 'Cause she

468
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,581
would have it right next to her.

469
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:01,760
MARISHA: Can I?

470
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,871
TALIESIN: We have the ball.

471
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,582
MATT: It's either a creature or location.

472
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:12,490
PATRICK: Well, if right now we're pretty sure that
they don't know we know where they are, do we want

473
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,267
to risk that? Losing the surprise?

474
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:24,654
MARISHA: We don't. If I scry on her cave, would
that tip her off? The cave of Opash?

475
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:26,830
MATT: Only one way to find out.

476
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,017
MARISHA: Only one way to find out?

477
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:35,708
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that-- personally, I
think it's safer to know what we know now and go

478
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,165
in, because if things--

479
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:44,174
MARISHA: I mean, I can always teleport us there
and scry there. That way, at least-- minutes.

480
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:49,022
MATT: As far as you know, when you create a sensor
at a location, creatures that can see invisibility

481
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:54,996
can see the actual scrying location, the orb
itself that you create, the magical orb of which

482
00:31:54,996 --> 00:32:01,378
your vision appears through. But that's the only
thing you would have to consider.

483
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,638
MARISHA: That's a massive thing to consider.

484
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:11,070
TRAVIS: Unless she's in, like, perma-bubble-bath
world or something.

485
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,304
LIAM: We should just go.

486
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:13,710
MARISHA: I think we should, too.

487
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,383
LAURA: Oh, jeez! I'm so nervous.

488
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:18,558
MARISHA: I know.

489
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:19,896
TRAVIS: I'm not.

490
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,735
TALIESIN: I'm feeling strangely positive.

491
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,196
TRAVIS: -2, playas.

492
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:25,337
LIAM: Would you put that piece of wood down,
please?

493
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:27,017
LAURA: He's eating wood again.

494
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:29,644
MARISHA: We need to get him another salt lick.

495
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:34,637
TRAVIS: I do miss my salt lick rock. Can I keep an
eye out as we walk

496
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:36,398
around for another salt lick rock?

497
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,165
MATT: Make a perception check.

498
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:43,229
TRAVIS: Don't make me do that. Ooh!

499
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,327
TALIESIN: God, the sound those things make.

500
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:46,520
TRAVIS: 13.

501
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,465
TALIESIN: It's like your dice have a subwoofer.

502
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:56,090
MATT: You find a few separate pieces of what look
like quartz-like rock that line the sides of the

503
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:01,620
road and the exterior garden of the castle, and
upon trying each one, not as salty as you'd hoped.

504
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,109
They're generally just bits of whitestone or
rock.

505
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,894
MARISHA: Grog, that's caca!

506
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:09,262
TRAVIS: Find your own!

507
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:12,511
TALIESIN: Let him lick it if he wants it. It's
just gonna make him happy.

508
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:15,949
TRAVIS: Is it close to salty? Could I confuse it
with salt?

509
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:19,382
MATT: I mean, you get a hint of salt, but it's
gone after the first lick.

510
00:33:19,386 --> 00:33:21,701
TRAVIS: More shiny than the others?

511
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,314
MATT: After licking it a few times, it gets a
little shinier, yeah.

512
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:27,332
TRAVIS: I am a great sorcerer. I will keep this
new stone.

513
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:30,299
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and mark three quartz
rocks.

514
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,552
TRAVIS: Palm-sized?

515
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,986
MATT: Roughly. Some are a little bigger. The
center one is a little bit

516
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:36,575
like a basketball size.

517
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,916
TRAVIS: Bag of Holding, you've got new occupants.

518
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:44,628
MARISHA: Putting rocks in the Bag of Holding. Just
filling it with rocks.

519
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,426
LAURA: Rocks and like dried poo.

520
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,478
MATT: Don't judge his collection.

521
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:58,377
MARISHA: Ox, oxen, troll dicks, pet rocks, just a
bunch of pet rocks.

522
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:06,430
MATT: All right. As you guys are preparing, Kima
and Allura catch up to you guys. They've gathered

523
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,130
their materials and they're prepped for battle.
Kima's fully armored.

524
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,702
MARISHA: Does she look badass? In her full
sorceress armor?

525
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,032
MATT: Oh, Allura?

526
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:16,706
MARISHA: Paint a picture. What's she look like?

527
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,378
(laughter)

528
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,168
MARISHA: She's an upper-middle-class girl.

529
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:29,541
MATT: She's wearing one of her many ceremonial
robes that she does for presentory Tal'Dorei

530
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:37,184
Council work, but you see she has a hood up over
her head, her hair braids are tied together behind

531
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,734
her neck so they don't get in the way. You notice
that there is some really nice jewelry that's

532
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:46,255
adorning the side of her neck. The staff she
carries with her usually is relatively simple, but

533
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:52,271
you see now that there are a number of runes
carved in a spiral along the sides of it. You can

534
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:58,145
see a number of rings that she previously wasn't
wearing that are on, and her face is hardened, and

535
00:34:58,145 --> 00:35:05,295
you see that she-- where normally she has this air
of keeping the room-- almost a teacher or

536
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:11,358
parental-type presence in the area, there's an
intensity and darkness to her face that you

537
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,229
haven't really seen before. Not since at least the
attack on the city happened.

538
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:16,708
LIAM: Work!

539
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:20,229
LAURA: (sings) Allura!

540
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:22,285
MATT: (sings) And Kima.

541
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:25,390
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

542
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:35,956
MATT: All right, guys. So. They've arrived, and
Allura steps into the room, her staff clicking

543
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:41,282
across the stone floor of the castle. "All right.
Have we put all of our affairs in order?"

544
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,612
TRAVIS: Yes.

545
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:45,538
TALIESIN: Well, I hate when you put it that way.

546
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,654
LAURA: Kima got the Feast, too, right?

547
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:51,613
MATT: They come in towards the beginning of the
casting of the Feast, and they eat as well, yes.

548
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:54,691
TALIESIN: It's a buffet. It's a Heroes' Buffet.

549
00:35:54,691 --> 00:36:07,422
MATT: "So. How best should we arrive? If you have
the ability to bring us through the tree, or I can

550
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,231
"teleport us there."

551
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:13,646
LAURA: Is it the same difference?

552
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:19,331
MARISHA: What power-- how much energy do you use
when you teleport?

553
00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:26,872
MATT: "As far as the advancement of spell
strength, a Teleport spell in its own right is the

554
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:29,486
"seventh sphere of magical incantation."

555
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:36,482
MARISHA: Mm. Then let me go with our Transport Via
Plants, which is more of a six, you know, level.

556
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:38,729
MATT: "Sounds like a wondrous idea."

557
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:45,141
TALIESIN: Worst-case scenario, we can camp for the
night, if are victorious and spent.

558
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,587
TRAVIS: I love camping.

559
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:50,544
MARISHA: Yeah, it looks like a very pretty
island.

560
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:54,906
TALIESIN: Let's make sure that one of the Gate
Stones is left here in case one of us has to make

561
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:56,078
a mad dash.

562
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:57,537
MARISHA: Give it to Cassandra?

563
00:36:57,537 --> 00:37:03,417
TALIESIN: Give it, obviously, keep it in
Cassandra's care. If somebody comes back, you know

564
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,419
everything's gone horribly wrong.

565
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:09,121
MATT: Kima rushes over and takes the stone from
your hand and goes, "All right, I'll give it to

566
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:14,033
"her. Be right back." She jogs off. You hear the
(clanging) of the armor as she disappears

567
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:14,995
TALIESIN: Maybe we should give--

568
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:16,659
TALIESIN and MARISHA: -- her the boots.

569
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,410
MARISHA: That's not a bad call.

570
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,648
LAURA: That's true.

571
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:24,132
MATT: So.

572
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:30,026
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, you know what? When Kima comes
back, I'm gonna give her the Elven boots, so she

573
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:31,661
can be quiet.

574
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:35,407
MATT: She takes them and is like, "Not really my
style."

575
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:37,343
LAURA: If you don't want them, I'll wear them, I
mean, I like them a lot.

576
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:40,147
I'm just saying, you're loud.

577
00:37:40,147 --> 00:37:47,656
MATT: "I'll take 'em." And you all wait patiently
for the next six minutes as she unbuckles and

578
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:52,423
pulls off the rest of her lower armor and gets the
boots on.

579
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,649
TRAVIS: That don't match at all.

580
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:57,291
MATT: No. And you can see it gives her a twinge of
disappointment.

581
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:02,550
MARISHA: It's like different tiered armors in
Warcraft. It's the worst.

582
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,019
LIAM: Slips her Doc Martens over here.

583
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:11,285
MATT: The expansion just came out, so it's like
all epics and one green that's better than the

584
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:22,347
rest. Yeah. That's the worst. (laughs) All right.
With you all gathered there, Allura, hood still

585
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:25,770
up, kind of nods. "Keyleth, lead the way. To the
Sun Tree, then?"

586
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,025
MARISHA: To the Sun Tree.

587
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:34,858
MATT: "Very well. (sighs) Let us hope that we
return here tomorrow victorious." She swirls

588
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,137
around, her cloak spinning around her base as she
follows suit after you, Keyleth, the rest of you

589
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:44,835
make your way, marching down the front of Castle
Whitestone to the center of the town, where there

590
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:53,705
you see the faint elements of green bloom now
growing across the tree from where once it was

591
00:38:53,705 --> 00:39:01,712
bare, the season bringing a sense of spring and
summer that have been kept at bay for a while. And

592
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:07,766
for you as well, Percival, this is the first time
in a long time you've seen the Sun Tree showing

593
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,291
that growing life.

594
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,496
TALIESIN: I quietly sneak up and give it a good
kiss.

595
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:18,890
MARISHA: Aw. I see it, and I'm like. You know, I
know him. I can put in a good word.

596
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,122
TALIESIN: Really? We talk all the time, he never
mentions you.

597
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:29,743
MARISHA: What? What? I'm gonna let that go.

598
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,233
(laughter)

599
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:36,272
MARISHA: That could be a discussion. I don't wanna
do that right now. We'll talk later.

600
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:38,594
Are we ready?

601
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:43,674
MATT: All right, so what are you focusing on for
the receiving end of this?

602
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:49,070
MARISHA: I'm assuming I found a tree that was
close to her cavern that's big enough?

603
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,895
MATT: With the second scrying that you did with
Allura, which was just specifically the Island of

604
00:39:53,895 --> 00:40:02,898
Viscan, you did see a number of trees not far from
the rocky protrusion, the small mountain that

605
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:11,576
seemed to be the place where this laboratory's in.
So yes, you can choose one of those trees you saw

606
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,127
that would be large enough to do it.

607
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,293
MARISHA: Okay.

608
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:22,367
TALIESIN: Scanlan stops us before we start. For
the record, this is a terrible idea and we have no

609
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:30,139
plan. Just putting it out there. I'm with you,
this is a terrible plan, and we're going to die.

610
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,636
LAURA: You seem different.

611
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:38,833
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I have a cold. I don't feel
well. I'm taking something for it.

612
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,031
TRAVIS: Sing me a song. Sing me a song right now.

613
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:42,136
TALIESIN: I'm not singing.

614
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:47,044
MARISHA: I try to stealthily sniff Scanlan. Does
he smell like--

615
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,027
MATT: (laughing) Well, first roll a stealth
check.

616
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:50,815
(laughter)

617
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,752
TRAVIS: Don't ever say the word.

618
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:55,071
MARISHA: Okay. 14.

619
00:40:55,071 --> 00:41:01,718
MATT: 14. The not-stealthy-at-all Keyleth slowly
approaches you. You see her. You make eye contact.

620
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:06,098
And yet she still slowly crawls up and begins
taking a big whiff on your shoulder.

621
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:10,167
MARISHA: (sniffs) Ah, so nervous.

622
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:18,587
TALIESIN: There once was a barbarian named Grog,
who had the IQ of a log-- I'd keep going, but now

623
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,744
you're excited, and you've made me lose my--

624
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,417
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

625
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,436
MARISHA: Does he smell like the incense that I
smelled from him before?

626
00:41:26,436 --> 00:41:31,525
MATT: No. He smells of frustration,
disappointment, and worry.

627
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:34,732
MARISHA: You smell like a sad man. All right,
let's go.

628
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:39,138
MATT: (laughs) All right. So do you go ahead and
cast the spell? All right.

629
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:45,447
MARISHA: I say to the Sun Tree, I say, I like your
new haircut. I have a new one too.

630
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:46,756
Okay, let's go.

631
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:49,281
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us
before we go through the tree.

632
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:56,187
MATT: Okay. So as the shadows coalesce around your
bodies, your legs, your knees, your feet, you

633
00:41:56,187 --> 00:42:02,224
watch as the front of the Sun Tree suddenly splits
open to reveal the pathway through across to what

634
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:08,751
looks to be a partially ruined jungle. You all
step through the tree quickly before the portal

635
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:13,537
slams shut behind you, and as you guys emerge,
looking about, you can see what looks to be a lot

636
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:24,021
of heavy dirt and earth that-- there's spatterings
of sand throughout, and surrounding it

637
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:29,484
immediately, you can see there are different trees
throughout this kind of-- some points are lush

638
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:34,093
green jungle on the outside, and the further in
you go, you watch as the trees have all withered

639
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:41,371
black. A little ways over the treeline, you can
see maybe a quarter-mile off what looks to be the

640
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:48,237
top of the mountain that a brief instant of your
first vision in your Scry spell lent you towards.

641
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:58,253
MARISHA: Does it look like the blight of the trees
is getting more concentrated the closer to the top

642
00:42:58,253 --> 00:42:59,360
of the mountain?

643
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,722
MATT: It looks like it's a radial effect from the
actual mountain, yes.

644
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:05,055
TRAVIS: Does it look like fire damage or something
else?

645
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,740
MATT: You want to go ahead and take a look? Make an
investigation check.

646
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,136
TRAVIS: Yeah! Stand back. 11 minus two.

647
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:27,031
MATT: (laughs) You can't recall the color, really,
that they've become, but it's not alive.

648
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:32,894
TRAVIS: Someone peed on these trees. All of 'em.
In a big circle. Like that.

649
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:37,103
MARISHA: Grog, is this what happens when you pee
on trees?

650
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:38,701
TRAVIS: Is that not normal?

651
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:44,058
MARISHA: We should talk with Pike when we get
home. Make sure you're okay.

652
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:48,932
LAURA: Oh, do you need me to cast another Greater
Restoration? For your--

653
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:51,600
MARISHA: No, his bladder infection's fine.

654
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,595
LAURA: Okay.

655
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:54,048
TALIESIN: It can keep.

656
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,234
MATT: It takes a Wish spell to get rid of that,
unfortunately.

657
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:00,735
LIAM: He's been in every brothel in Tal'Dorei,
it's to be expected.

658
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:02,677
(laughter)

659
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:03,937
TRAVIS: Not ashamed.

660
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:07,938
LAURA: He and Scanlan both.

661
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:11,037
MARISHA: Did he find anything out? Did you find
anything out?

662
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:12,466
MATT: No, he didn't find anything.

663
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:13,506
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

664
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:14,699
MATT: Sure, go for it.

665
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,329
TRAVIS: These trees aren't alive.

666
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,446
MARISHA: Fancy that. That's good. 21.

667
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:25,591
MATT: Okay. As you guys begin to walk through--
it's not a very dense jungle.

668
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:27,726
LAURA: We want to keep quiet as we do it.

669
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:29,184
MATT: Okay, so make stealth checks as well.

670
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:31,357
MARISHA: We have Pass Without a Trace?

671
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:33,305
MATT: Yes you do, so plus ten to all your
stealth.

672
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:34,635
MARISHA: Natural 20!

673
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:36,517
MARISHA and LAURA: Pew-pew-pew!

674
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:39,537
MARISHA: If only it mattered right now.
Pew-pew-pew.

675
00:44:39,537 --> 00:44:50,468
MATT: All righty. And a natural 20 for Allura.
And, actually-- I rolled with disadvantage for

676
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:54,437
Kima, and it was like a 16 and a four, but then
she had the boots on, so the first one sticks.

677
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:56,267
LAURA: 24 for Pike!

678
00:44:56,267 --> 00:45:00,397
MATT: Nice. So, stealthily, you guys-- what did
you roll?

679
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:05,313
TALIESIN: I rolled 33 and Scanlan rolled 31.

680
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:06,767
MATT: Grog?

681
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:08,211
TRAVIS: 13.

682
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:09,281
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

683
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:10,274
TRAVIS: Yep.

684
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,187
TALIESIN: Okay.

685
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,302
MATT: With the plus ten?

686
00:45:12,302 --> 00:45:13,245
TRAVIS: Yep.

687
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:14,449
TALIESIN: How did you do that?

688
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:16,594
MATT: Okay, well, Kerr, what did you get?

689
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:18,288
PATRICK: 14 for me.

690
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:19,655
LAURA: Plus ten?

691
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:23,598
PATRICK: Where did that plus ten come from?

692
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,121
LAURA: From Pass Without a Trace!

693
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,363
MATT: A spell that she had cast on all of you.

694
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:29,251
PATRICK: Then I am at 24.

695
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,866
(cheering)

696
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:32,861
LAURA: 38.

697
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:34,822
MARISHA: 37!

698
00:45:34,822 --> 00:45:39,669
MATT: As you guys fan out in this--

699
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,700
(computer chime)

700
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,475
TALIESIN: Now boarding: Star Tours.

701
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:46,376
MARISHA: Thanks for that, Microsoft Outlook.

702
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:51,615
MATT: As you begin to weave your way through these
trees as quietly as you possibly can, Keyleth, you

703
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:59,222
step behind and run your fingers along some of
these withered grey and black fronds and branches.

704
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:09,537
All these trees look like they had the life force
pulled from them, almost like a very, very rapid

705
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:14,690
starvation, or thirst took them, but what's
interesting is a lot of these trees are

706
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,535
near-petrified and have been this way for a very
long time.

707
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:19,875
MARISHA: That was gonna be my question.

708
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,304
MATT: It's not a recent occurrence.

709
00:46:21,304 --> 00:46:23,492
MARISHA: So like the petrified forest in Arizona?

710
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:27,951
MATT: Kind of, yeah. But a sadder version, if
that's possible. They're all like

711
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,028
"ehh, I'm a bad tree."

712
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:37,752
TALIESIN: What do I know about Opash and the
crimes and what sort of tinkering?

713
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:41,590
MATT: You don't know that much. The fact that you
knew the name and a little bit of the history was

714
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:50,239
even impressive by the standards of everyone here.
What little you do know is that he was sent away

715
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:58,080
specifically because of his inquiries into how far
you can reach with necromantic magics, and lost

716
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,442
history from the Age of Arcanum.

717
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,157
TALIESIN: Okay, that's good to know.

718
00:47:02,157 --> 00:47:09,230
MATT: The Age of Arcanum was the epoch before the
Divergence, before the Calamity hit, and not a lot

719
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,844
of history exists about it, a lot of it was
destroyed either during the battle, or people

720
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:20,244
destroyed it thereafter to prevent us from reusing
what led to that sort of conflict. But Opash

721
00:47:20,244 --> 00:47:23,514
apparently had gathered, or at least was in the
process of trying to recover, some of that

722
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:24,713
information.

723
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:29,509
MARISHA: So these trees have been dead for
hundreds of years.

724
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:31,192
MATT: Hundreds of years, yes.

725
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:32,519
MARISHA: All right.

726
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,948
TALIESIN: So the scarring does not seem recent.

727
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:36,083
MARISHA: And there's no new scarring.

728
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:40,186
MATT: There does not appear to be any new scarring
that you can tell based on

729
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:41,447
what you've seen so far.

730
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:42,801
MARISHA: That's very good.

731
00:47:42,852 --> 00:47:47,318
LAURA: Do I see any sign of tracks or anything?
Dragon tracks?

732
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:49,780
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

733
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,751
LAURA: Dragging of giant carcasses or just,
y'know, footprints.

734
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,865
TALIESIN: Yellow 'Dragon Crossing' signs.

735
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:57,612
LAURA: Advantage, 'cause it's a dragon.

736
00:47:57,612 --> 00:47:59,162
MATT: If it's dragon-related.

737
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:01,210
LAURA: It is dragon-related. Natural 20.

738
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,162
MATT: All righty. There are no dragon tracks.

739
00:48:04,162 --> 00:48:05,325
LAURA: Motherfucker.

740
00:48:05,325 --> 00:48:09,744
TALIESIN: She licks a tree. "No dragon has been
here."

741
00:48:09,814 --> 00:48:12,832
(laughter)

742
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:15,810
LAURA: I bet there's other tracks, though, that I
totally missed 'cause I was looking for dragons.

743
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,072
MATT: Yes.

744
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:21,114
LAURA: Can I look for anything other than dragons?
There won't be an advantage.

745
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:22,527
MATT: Go for it, sure.

746
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:28,957
LAURA: I really want that 20, but I don't
get it. This one is not as good. Is this an

747
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:31,552
investigation? Perception?

748
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:34,644
MATT: Yeah, this would be investigation for you,
sitting down and getting close and looking

749
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,113
throughout the dirt.

750
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,204
LAURA: (whispers) 11.

751
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:42,813
MATT: 11? You do find tracks, but they're
scattered and they're small feet. Looks like some

752
00:48:42,813 --> 00:48:46,056
indigenous creatures or wildlife that exists on
this landscape.

753
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,558
LAURA: Okay. But they were little.

754
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:57,398
MATT: They were all little, yeah. As you guys push
through, Allura looks up toward the boughs of the

755
00:48:57,398 --> 00:49:05,600
dead trees. "While you were preparing, I did some
research on this island, and it seems that there

756
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:16,107
"were an indigenous people that lived here before
Opash came. Thousands that made seaward trade

757
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:24,553
"routes to the north and the west, and when he made
this his home, the indigenous people were never

758
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:30,524
"heard from again. It is believed by many who fare
the seas that this land is cursed and is to be

759
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:38,555
"avoided for that reason. This forest, one of the
superstitious points of that reasoning, there are

760
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:48,204
"a few that come through hoping to scavenge or find
things from his lost whereabouts, or his own hoard

761
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:53,416
"or treasures he may have garnished in his time,
but few of those return as well."

762
00:49:53,416 --> 00:50:00,747
TALIESIN: Well, if Raishan came back, then who
knows what horrors actually do exist on this

763
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:07,117
island? It's possible that she found some of his
notes and built upon them.

764
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:08,855
There could be anything.

765
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:16,354
MARISHA: Did you read if the island was trapped or
any type of arcane presence on it?

766
00:50:16,354 --> 00:50:23,229
MATT: "Well, if this was the lair of a
necromancer, an entity that is both selfish and

767
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:28,776
"driven towards the personal power and advancement
of their own narcissism, I can imagine that they

768
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:36,605
"are very well protected with their secrets. The
fact that this abode was taken by Thordak before

769
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:44,626
"he made reign upon the southern side of the
continent... who knows what happened to Opash?"

770
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:48,802
MARISHA: Thordak made this his abode?

771
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:55,208
MATT: "Yes. Up until he began to wander onto the
continent of Tal'Dorei."

772
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,548
TALIESIN: Interesting.

773
00:50:57,548 --> 00:51:02,091
LAURA: Mm-hm.

774
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:09,812
TALIESIN: I'm just playing some conjecture in my
head. You have a powerful necromancer, if there's

775
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:18,307
any possibility that he could've found a semblance
of unlife, of Opash wandering around, and bent him

776
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:23,502
towards his will, then we don't know how that gem
got into his chest in the first place. We don't

777
00:51:23,502 --> 00:51:30,275
know how any of this happened, and there's just
too much we don't know yet.

778
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:31,976
We have to find the cave.

779
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:40,479
MATT: "The gem we created. Me, Kima, Drake. As far
as we know, if any of her stories can be believed,

780
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:47,208
"Raishan was responsible for the rituals that
embedded it within Thordak's chest on the

781
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:53,261
"Plane of Fire during her time with the Fire
Ashari. Once again, as much as we can believe."

782
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:56,070
TALIESIN: There's just a lot we don't know.

783
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,965
MATT: "Let us be careful. Press on."

784
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:05,403
LAURA: Tread carefully. Just keep an eye out.
We're keeping eyes out for anything that looks

785
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:08,256
different than normal jungle-ness.

786
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:11,886
LIAM: You and I head out 20 feet ahead of
everybody and check for traps as we go.

787
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:13,215
Carefully.

788
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:15,533
MATT: Investigation checks from both you guys, if
you don't mind.

789
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:16,684
LIAM: Investigation or--

790
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:20,196
MATT: If you're looking for traps specifically?
Investigation.

791
00:52:20,196 --> 00:52:24,003
LAURA: 26.

792
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:25,144
LIAM: 18.

793
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:28,854
MATT: Okay. Pushing forward, you guys--

794
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,805
LAURA: I wasn't just looking for traps, I'm
looking for anything that looks out of place in

795
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:37,231
the forest, 'cause I don't know what kind of traps
necessarily would be set by something like this.

796
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,452
You know what I mean?

797
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:48,414
MATT: Sure. In a very Laura Bailey "how much can I
get out of this roll?" I know, I know, I know, I'm

798
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:56,126
just messing with you. So as you guys push
forward, you, Vax, notice that the further in you

799
00:52:56,126 --> 00:53:04,790
go towards this mountain, the trees, still dead,
grey, are even further withered, and many of them

800
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,360
have just turned to ash and dust. And the closer
you get, the actual treeline grows thinner and

801
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,444
lower as it seems like the closer it gets to the
mountain, they're bereft of most of their

802
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:22,884
structure. You do, Vex, catch as your brother is
moving forward, he is stepping towards a section

803
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:30,072
of the earth and sand that has slightly different
texture, ever-so-slightly from the rest, and he's

804
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,488
but a few feet from stepping into that space.

805
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:43,600
LAURA: Vax! Stop! There's some weirdness on the
ground. I feel like it's something.

806
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:47,085
LIAM: So you think something's up under the ground
there?

807
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:48,312
LAURA: Yeah.

808
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,563
LIAM: I mean, what do I do at this point?

809
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:52,593
MATT: What do you want to do? You look down, and
you--

810
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:54,150
LAURA: Don't you see it?

811
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,406
MATT: It looks almost like--

812
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:57,262
LIAM: I'm gonna take a closer look, is what I'm
gonna do.

813
00:53:57,262 --> 00:54:01,554
MATT: It looks like the difference between sand
and slightly damp sand. The coloration is just

814
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:03,461
ever so faintly--

815
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:05,463
LAURA: Now that you're looking, now that you're
looking, you can tell, right?

816
00:54:05,463 --> 00:54:08,234
LIAM: Now that I have context. Context is key, as
always.

817
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:11,153
TRAVIS: Can I push him in? No, I'm kidding.

818
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:13,173
LAURA: Is it quicksand?

819
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:18,259
LIAM: Do I find a trap if I'm looking closer, now,
with her added?

820
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:25,859
MATT: I mean, it looks different from the rest.
There's no mechanism there, you don't see a pulley

821
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:26,693
or a--

822
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:27,939
LAURA: Maybe it's magic.

823
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:29,618
LIAM: How much of it looks different?

824
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:35,843
MATT: It's avoidable. It's like a ten-, 15-foot
oval area.

825
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:40,265
LAURA: Hey, everyone. Let's just not step on this
dark patch, how about that?

826
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:41,209
TRAVIS: Why?

827
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:43,580
LAURA: 'Cause I think it's like magic or
something, Grog.

828
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,735
TRAVIS: Like good magic?

829
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,835
LAURA: Like bad magic.

830
00:54:45,835 --> 00:54:47,893
TRAVIS: What kind of bad magic?

831
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:50,398
LAURA: The kind that would kill us all.

832
00:54:50,398 --> 00:54:54,465
MARISHA: Like the kind that gives you a really bad
headache.

833
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,871
TRAVIS: I really don't want another one of those.

834
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:58,806
LAURA: Similar sort of thing.

835
00:54:58,806 --> 00:54:59,829
LIAM: Continue.

836
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:05,259
MATT: Now that you've identified that, you've come
across a few more patches, and they seem to grow

837
00:55:05,259 --> 00:55:12,518
more dense as the trees grow more withered and
gone, until you get to a point where you can now

838
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,805
see the base of this mountain.

839
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:23,027
MARISHA: Can I from a distance maybe do a nature
check? Are these almost like siphons, like wells

840
00:55:23,027 --> 00:55:26,442
where he was sucking the life force?

841
00:55:26,442 --> 00:55:28,250
MATT: Make a nature check.

842
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,032
TALIESIN: Or maybe quicksand? This could be all
the quicksand we were promised as children.

843
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:33,022
LAURA: I know, right?

844
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:34,523
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. Always quicksand.

845
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:36,633
TRAVIS: Seriously. Today's kids do not appreciate
quicksand.

846
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,279
TALIESIN: It was such a big part of my childhood.

847
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:40,334
MARISHA: Why did I never find quicksand? 22.

848
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:46,355
MATT: 22. These are less siphons, they're more
what looks to be-- it's a phenomenon known as

849
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:55,994
hollow earth, which is when subterranean caverns
go into collapse.

850
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,340
LIAM: Sinkholes.

851
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:03,492
MATT: It can create a sinkhole-like phenomenon,
but hollow earth generally is based on some sort

852
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:10,846
of magical release, an explosion of magical energy
beneath the earth that causes-- even though there

853
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:16,824
is no space, it erodes the earth from its magic
presence, whether it just completely disintegrates

854
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:21,678
or destroys portions of the earth, it leaves this
very, very unstable portion of ground.

855
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:26,884
MARISHA: So it's like a magical quasar? That
blasts out?

856
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,386
MATT: You're not entirely certain what it'll do,
but it's not good.

857
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:37,049
TRAVIS: I take one of my new salt lick rocks and I
throw it in one of the little sandy pools.

858
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:46,094
MATT: Okay. As you take the rock and throw it into
the sandy pool, it lands with a little bit of dirt

859
00:56:46,094 --> 00:56:48,559
being kicked up around it and sits there for a
rest.

860
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,042
TRAVIS: Ooh, magic, huh? Real scary.

861
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:52,435
LAURA: And then?

862
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:57,540
TALIESIN: Would the rock tell you if it was having
a headache right now? How would it tell you that?

863
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,507
TRAVIS: I have a psychic connection with my
rocks.

864
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:00,714
LIAM: You also weigh a little more--

865
00:57:00,714 --> 00:57:04,555
MATT: The rock then goes-- it just falls
underneath, and you can see a spot in the ground,

866
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,517
perfectly shaped where the rock was, that is now
just--

867
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:09,094
LAURA: Told you it was dangerous.

868
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:11,456
TRAVIS: I actually did that. It's magic.

869
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:13,273
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

870
00:57:13,273 --> 00:57:16,973
TRAVIS: Don't step there.

871
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:20,095
MARISHA: You figured it out, Grog, good job.

872
00:57:20,095 --> 00:57:23,826
TALIESIN: Weird point of contention for my
imagination. Are the trees wilting, or do they

873
00:57:23,826 --> 00:57:25,816
seem like there was a bit of a blast?

874
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:29,082
MATT: They are not leaning a specific direction.

875
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:30,717
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's no pattern to it.

876
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:33,739
MATT: Yeah, and it isn't like there are were
leaves or anything blown off of them. It just

877
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:36,506
looked like they gradually just died rapidly in
place.

878
00:57:36,506 --> 00:57:38,446
LIAM: Seems like the closer we get, the deader it
gets.

879
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:40,798
LAURA: Can we see the mountain that we're getting
towards?

880
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,594
MATT: Yes, you can, and you guys maneuver around
these spaces to get to the base of it, and it's a

881
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:52,782
moderate-sized mountain, nothing impressive on the
outside, it's maybe 600 feet tall at its apex,

882
00:57:52,782 --> 00:57:58,344
it's more of a large, rocky mound. Make a
perception check.

883
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:01,923
LIAM: Natural 20.

884
00:58:01,923 --> 00:58:05,720
MATT: There's nothing in here. Why do I keep
trying to sip?

885
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,704
LAURA: 30 is what I rolled, but that's not as good
as a natural 20.

886
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:10,519
LIAM: No, it's not.

887
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:12,716
LAURA: But 30 is still good.

888
00:58:12,716 --> 00:58:14,846
MATT: But what's your bonus to perception?

889
00:58:14,846 --> 00:58:17,275
LIAM: Perception, oh yeah, is 12. So 32.

890
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:21,623
MATT: Okay, so close. You guys being at the front
of the party anyway--

891
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:25,829
LAURA: Whoa, your perception bonus is higher than
mine? When did that happen?

892
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:27,767
TALIESIN: How did you just notice that?

893
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:29,627
LIAM: Who fucking knows?

894
00:58:29,627 --> 00:58:35,773
MATT: As you guys scoot forward, being ahead of
the rest of the party, you glance across the

895
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:42,262
surface of this, and most of the rock follows the
familiar pattern of tectonic shift that's broken

896
00:58:42,262 --> 00:58:47,040
and cracked in places, but it's been, over
hundreds and thousands of years, just settled into

897
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,459
its natural state. There is one section of rock
just maybe 200 feet from where you are landing at

898
00:58:53,459 --> 00:59:00,156
the base where it looks like the texture, the
natural lines of the rock, is in a different

899
00:59:00,156 --> 00:59:08,052
direction. And upon you heading in that direction,
you can see, now, what it appears to be is a large

900
00:59:08,052 --> 00:59:16,818
rock, very large, maybe 20, 30 feet wide, that is
jammed into an entranceway.

901
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:18,761
LIAM: I perceive a rock.

902
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:20,377
MARISHA: I got a rock.

903
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:25,086
MATT: Kind of. There are a number of strange holes
peppered over the surface.

904
00:59:25,086 --> 00:59:26,937
LAURA: Like, big holes?

905
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:31,462
MATT: About the size of a-- larger than a gold
piece, each hole.

906
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:36,714
LAURA: Does it look like it could be, like, things
could come out of it?

907
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:38,175
MATT: Possibly?

908
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,691
LIAM: Checking for traps.

909
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:42,398
MATT: You have to check it.

910
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:46,019
TRAVIS: You know what Gilmore would do. Put his
hand in it.

911
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:48,049
TALIESIN: How very Flash Gordon.

912
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:50,743
LIAM: 25 for investigation.

913
00:59:50,743 --> 00:59:52,241
MATT: Investigation, okay.

914
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,546
LAURA: Do I need to roll, since he's so good?

915
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:55,743
LIAM: Might as well.

916
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:59,543
LAURA: What if it's a one? Ooh. No, 24. Damn.

917
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:01,448
TRAVIS: Got you a water, Matt.

918
01:00:01,448 --> 01:00:09,152
MATT: Thank you, sir. So. Are the rest of you guys
following up behind them?

919
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:14,584
LIAM: Just wait a moment, wait a moment. No, hang
back for a second.

920
01:00:14,584 --> 01:00:23,233
MATT: Okay. Between the two of you glancing, you
notice that each one of these holes is actually a

921
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:32,430
pierced intrusion upon the rock, something very
quickly jammed itself into the rock to create this

922
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:41,446
hole. And they're clustered in places. And you,
with your experience, these claws are respective

923
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:49,726
to the size of a very, very, very large dragon.
And it looks like different-- some of them are

924
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:55,592
more weathered than others. This boulder has been
placed and pulled back and placed many, many times

925
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:57,143
throughout the years.

926
01:00:57,143 --> 01:01:02,482
LAURA: It's probably too heavy for us to move, but
Grog, do you want to try?

927
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:04,760
TALIESIN: I don't know if we should move it.

928
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,536
LAURA: Well, how do we get in if we don't open the
entrance?

929
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:13,597
PATRICK: If nothing else, rather than moving the
whole boulder, is there a way we could just get

930
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:15,456
enough of a crack to get in?

931
01:01:15,493 --> 01:01:18,287
MARISHA: I can Stone Shape it a little bit
thinner.

932
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:20,299
LAURA: Ooh, dig. I like that.

933
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:24,374
TALIESIN: Just so that if the dragon tries to run,
they have to move a giant boulder, it would be

934
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:25,778
really convenient.

935
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:27,097
LAURA: Oh, good call.

936
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:30,987
MARISHA: Does it look like there's-- am I there? I'm
not there yet.

937
01:01:31,037 --> 01:01:33,210
MATT: You guys are hanging back.

938
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,581
LIAM: Kik.

939
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:41,488
MARISHA: All right, I'll go up. Is there a crack
that looks like it can kind of just whittle it

940
01:01:41,488 --> 01:01:44,703
away, that's kind of already started with the
boulder?

941
01:01:44,703 --> 01:01:51,315
MATT: I mean, the boulder is larger than the
entranceway that it's jammed into, and you're not

942
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:56,907
entirely certain what the inside of this cavern
mouth is, if it's just a direct intersection point

943
01:01:56,907 --> 01:02:00,336
or if it's a gradual influx. You can just try and
push through at

944
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:02,124
one of those points if you'd like.

945
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:05,439
LAURA: Can you just put a hole in the middle, like
right in the center of the boulder,

946
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:06,427
on the ground?

947
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:08,556
TALIESIN: Or would it be easier just to scrape
across the side?

948
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:15,581
MARISHA: I only have a limited amount of space
that I can carve out, so the boulder might be too

949
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:20,958
thick, but if I do it at the seam line, I should
be able to do it. I want to do it at the seam.

950
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:26,189
TRAVIS: Do we want to take the first entrance that
we find, I mean, is it really one way in, one way

951
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:28,565
out? What if it's just, like, a trap?

952
01:02:28,565 --> 01:02:31,798
MARISHA: Does someone want to check for traps?

953
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:38,524
MATT: They already checked. It did not appear to
be trapped, just a very, very heavy rock.

954
01:02:38,524 --> 01:02:44,201
TRAVIS: I mean, like, run a perimeter, do any
recon, anything else?

955
01:02:44,201 --> 01:02:48,195
LAURA: We'd have to run around an entire mountain.
Does it look like there

956
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,194
could be any other entrances?

957
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:52,716
MATT: I mean, you'd have to go around the entire
mountain.

958
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:54,699
LAURA: How long would it take if I flew around?

959
01:02:54,699 --> 01:03:03,267
MATT: Oh, maybe at full speed, hour and a half,
two hours?

960
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:05,036
TRAVIS: Fuck that, death first, open the door.

961
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:07,207
LAURA: All right, cool cool cool, let's just shape
the boulder.

962
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:15,065
MARISHA: Do I want to scry on the inside, or are
we just going in? Do I want to scry and see if

963
01:03:15,065 --> 01:03:16,614
she's there?

964
01:03:16,614 --> 01:03:21,369
MATT: This accounts for you flying, stopping,
checking, flying, stopping, checking. You can't

965
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:23,986
just check for traps while going by at 50 feet
around.

966
01:03:23,986 --> 01:03:25,810
TALIESIN: Scrying on the inside.

967
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:29,195
MATT: Are you gonna scry?

968
01:03:29,195 --> 01:03:31,662
MARISHA: Are we just going in?

969
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:32,729
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're doing it.

970
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,757
TALIESIN: I think we'll just go in. I mean, what
are we gonna see that's gonna

971
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,233
make us change our mind?

972
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:39,397
LAURA and MARISHA: Well, if she's not there.

973
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:43,987
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna try to detect
dragons! What the fuck?

974
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,688
MARISHA: Yeah, that's better!

975
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,508
LAURA: I sit down and go, hmm.

976
01:03:47,508 --> 01:03:53,361
TRAVIS: Do you have a headache too? Oh my god,
we're all gonna die. I'm patient zero.

977
01:03:53,361 --> 01:04:00,297
PATRICK: If I'm up by the boulder, too, I will
do-- I don't have a huge range, but I will do

978
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:01,605
Divine Sense.

979
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:02,708
MATT: Okay.

980
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:06,819
PATRICK: I can detect all manner of stuff up to 60
feet.

981
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:17,320
MATT: Yes, you can. All righty. So, using your
Divine Sense, let's see here. Okay, so you spend

982
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,680
your time just focusing, making sure there's
nothing either in or in the immediate vicinity of

983
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:27,836
the rock boulder that could be of celestial,
fiend, or undead nature. While you spend a spell

984
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:41,125
slot to do your Primeval Awareness. So yes, you do
sense what appear to be three sources of dragon

985
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:51,281
life force within the space. Roughly in the
direction of this mountain and below.

986
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:59,340
LAURA: They're here, they're here. Oh, god.
(hyperventilates) They're here, she's still here,

987
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,433
and I think the eggs are okay, 'cause I can still
feel like there's dragons.

988
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:03,766
MARISHA: Oh, they're still alive?

989
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:04,777
LAURA: I think so.

990
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:07,371
MARISHA: God damn it. God. Okay. All right.

991
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:13,161
LAURA: I just did it within a mile, so is that
okay? Was that within a mile?

992
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:15,776
MATT: I believe it's--

993
01:05:15,776 --> 01:05:17,975
LAURA: Or did I need to spend longer?

994
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:25,223
MATT: For that one, it is for one minute per level
of the spell. And it's within one mile, up to six

995
01:05:25,223 --> 01:05:27,091
miles if you're in your favored terrain.

996
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:30,274
LAURA: Oh, so I am, because it's woods, right?
Wooded?

997
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:34,501
MATT: It's not wooded anymore, so it's one mile.
So you know at least they're within a mile.

998
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,184
MARISHA: That's big.

999
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:37,742
TALIESIN: That's huge.

1000
01:05:37,742 --> 01:05:39,177
MARISHA: All right.

1001
01:05:39,177 --> 01:05:41,175
LIAM: So this is happening.

1002
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:45,729
MARISHA: Does anyone need to do anything else
before we go in?

1003
01:05:45,729 --> 01:05:47,486
LAURA: I have to go take a poo.

1004
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:49,476
MARISHA: I have to pee, too. I have to pee so
bad.

1005
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,436
(laughter)

1006
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:53,170
MATT: Was that in character?

1007
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,587
MARISHA: It's both?

1008
01:05:54,587 --> 01:05:56,513
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

1009
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:58,466
MARISHA: Little bit of both.

1010
01:05:58,466 --> 01:06:02,669
LAURA: All right.

1011
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:04,783
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

1012
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:06,497
LAURA: We're gonna go in? Let's go in!

1013
01:06:06,497 --> 01:06:08,897
MARISHA: Does anyone need to do a thing?

1014
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:14,347
LAURA: I mean, I don't know if we're gonna have to
go through. And it only lasts for a minute, so I

1015
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:16,489
feel like we're gonna be in the caves longer than--

1016
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:17,467
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

1017
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:19,397
LAURA: So we're still stealthing.

1018
01:06:19,397 --> 01:06:25,126
TRAVIS: Wait, actually, can I pull Vex aside real
quick? Can I talk to you

1019
01:06:25,126 --> 01:06:26,730
just real fast before we--

1020
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,529
LAURA: Me?

1021
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,357
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a little further away, like in
private?

1022
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:34,640
LAURA: Grog. I'm already seeing someone.

1023
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:42,893
TRAVIS: No, I know. I hate to beat a dead bush.
Horse? Cow? I hate to beat a dead cow, but I

1024
01:06:42,893 --> 01:06:47,182
really did like that little magic thing I found.

1025
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:48,863
LAURA: What little magic thing, darling?

1026
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:52,907
TRAVIS: When we were looting and stuff? And I've
been really worried about you. I know you like to

1027
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:58,331
bargain, right? So I thought I could trade you
back for what I found. And I have this little

1028
01:06:58,331 --> 01:07:04,297
Parapet of Wound Closure, you've been dying so
much, right? And if you wear this and you die, you

1029
01:07:04,297 --> 01:07:08,186
immediately stabilize on your next turn. I figured
it'd be a good trade.

1030
01:07:08,235 --> 01:07:12,918
LAURA: Do I have to attune to that, Grog?

1031
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:14,524
TRAVIS: No.

1032
01:07:14,524 --> 01:07:17,177
LAURA: You're lying.

1033
01:07:17,177 --> 01:07:24,591
TRAVIS: It's a big word. I don't really know what
you're saying. I really liked it. I mean, it made

1034
01:07:24,591 --> 01:07:27,344
a magic sword when I touched it.

1035
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:28,931
LAURA: Grog, and then it gave you a headache!

1036
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:36,237
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can deal with a headache. I
won't-- I just, I found it, you know?

1037
01:07:36,237 --> 01:07:40,945
LAURA: Grog. (yells) Grog!

1038
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:42,309
TRAVIS: What?

1039
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:46,476
LAURA: This is awful. No, it's so bad for you.

1040
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:49,138
TRAVIS: Look, you won't die, you won't die.

1041
01:07:49,138 --> 01:07:54,598
LAURA: (laughing) You motherfucker.

1042
01:07:54,598 --> 01:07:57,298
TRAVIS: It's only 'cause I'm looking out for you.

1043
01:07:57,298 --> 01:07:58,597
LAURA: Oh my god.

1044
01:07:58,597 --> 01:08:00,338
LIAM: It's the wedding all over again.

1045
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:02,608
LAURA: You see how hard this is when people want
their boots back, when people

1046
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:03,932
want their decks back...

1047
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:06,866
LIAM: Don't compare the boots to the deck, are you
kidding me?

1048
01:08:06,866 --> 01:08:10,004
LAURA: You did find it.

1049
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,119
TALIESIN: Technically, it's somebody else's.

1050
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,666
LIAM: What do you care what he says?

1051
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:19,899
LAURA: Grog. You have to promise me you won't pull
anything from it. All you can do is hold onto it.

1052
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:25,828
That's all you can do. You can't look at anything,
you have to keep it in its little pouch.

1053
01:08:25,828 --> 01:08:32,499
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah, I don't look at anything, I
keep it in its little pouch, I don't pull

1054
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:35,920
anything. I promise.

1055
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,433
LAURA: So, you know in Guardians of the Galaxy,
when he gives him that little ball at the end?

1056
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:43,754
MATT: Yeah.

1057
01:08:43,754 --> 01:08:50,229
LAURA: Can I do that? Can I give him a pouch?
Here's your cards back. But don't look at them,

1058
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:53,871
Grog. They're really dangerous. All right?

1059
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:56,087
TRAVIS: You want to trade?

1060
01:08:56,087 --> 01:08:57,598
LAURA: Yeah, give me the necklace.

1061
01:08:57,598 --> 01:09:01,158
TRAVIS: Okay, there. I take the cards.

1062
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:03,996
MATT: Okay. So what are you giving him?

1063
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:08,906
LAURA: A little pouch that's the shape of the deck
of cards.

1064
01:09:08,906 --> 01:09:11,921
MATT: How do you make the pouch the shape of
cards?

1065
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:15,267
LAURA: It's maybe not that good of a pouch, but
it's Grog.

1066
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:17,627
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check with
disadvantage.

1067
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:18,869
LAURA: Okay.

1068
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,662
TALIESIN: Aw, man.

1069
01:09:20,662 --> 01:09:25,038
LIAM: Yeah, everybody saw through it immediately,
just so you know.

1070
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:33,294
LAURA: Well, obviously! But it's Grog. That's
really bad. He's gonna be able to tell. Nine?

1071
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:41,696
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check, Grog.

1072
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:44,866
TRAVIS: Six.

1073
01:09:44,866 --> 01:09:46,737
TALIESIN: Yes!

1074
01:09:46,737 --> 01:09:53,020
MATT: The trade is complete. She hands you your
deck of cards, she takes her

1075
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,338
Parapet of Wound Closure.

1076
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:57,694
LAURA: Oh my god, I'm in so much trouble!

1077
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,914
(laughter)

1078
01:09:59,914 --> 01:10:03,116
PATRICK: I like to think that there's a live
kitten in this pouch.

1079
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,611
(laughter)

1080
01:10:05,611 --> 01:10:08,176
MATT: If you pull the right card, yeah.

1081
01:10:08,176 --> 01:10:10,621
LIAM: Well, you saved the party, but your marriage
is in jeopardy.

1082
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:16,076
LAURA: I know. He's so mad at me! He's so mad.
It's really good that he's sitting over at the

1083
01:10:16,076 --> 01:10:18,068
other table right now.

1084
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:19,874
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get the wrath of this.

1085
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:21,383
MARISHA: I know, we have him!

1086
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,716
TALIESIN: I can feel the heat emanating right
now.

1087
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:35,045
MATT: So, feeling satisfied that your imploring of
Vex and a trade you've made, your shiny package of

1088
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:40,437
happy cards are back in your possession, but you
promised, at the moment, at least--

1089
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,717
TRAVIS: To not look at them. All right.

1090
01:10:42,717 --> 01:10:46,158
MATT: While she's right there in front of you,
yeah.

1091
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,064
TRAVIS: Thank you, Vex. That really means the
world.

1092
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:51,264
LAURA: Seriously, though, they're really, really
dangerous.

1093
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,698
TRAVIS: I know, they're really special. I won't
look at them or anything. That means a lot. I

1094
01:10:54,698 --> 01:10:58,797
don't find a lot of great things. I did find a
couple rocks, earlier, if you want them.

1095
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,578
LAURA: Oh, they're yours.

1096
01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:04,195
TRAVIS: Okay. Are you sure? You're not gonna try
and steal that shit, too?

1097
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:05,858
LAURA: No, I promise.

1098
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:11,293
TRAVIS: Cool. Let's go kill a dragon. And I
jauntily and cheerily walk back to the group.

1099
01:11:11,293 --> 01:11:13,977
(laughter)

1100
01:11:13,977 --> 01:11:16,304
LIAM: He looks happy. What was that about?

1101
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:20,640
LAURA: (nervous laughter) Oh, I just gave him back
his cards, is all.

1102
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,817
TRAVIS: So happy to be reunited.

1103
01:11:24,817 --> 01:11:27,051
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

1104
01:11:27,051 --> 01:11:28,870
MATT: All right, so. What are the rest of you
doing in the meantime?

1105
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:34,340
MARISHA: You've got a little bead of sweat on your
forehead, Vex. It's such a humid jungle.

1106
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:37,134
LIAM: We zoom in on the single drop.

1107
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:45,083
MARISHA: I'm waiting to sculpt a hole in the
door.

1108
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:52,059
MATT: Okay. So, using Stone Shape, you can-- a
section of stone no more than five feet in any

1109
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:59,247
dimension, and form in any shape that suits your
purpose. So. You can make a small passage, as long

1110
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:05,238
as it is no more than five feet thick. The wall
and the stone are both thicker than five feet. You

1111
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:14,356
can begin to make a slight passageway. You can
create enough of a crack with your spell, as it

1112
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:20,396
completes, which, mark off your 4th-level spell,
but as you create it, you do manage to pierce, and

1113
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:25,639
you can look into the darkness of the tunnel
behind, but through the full use of the spell, you

1114
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:32,326
create this kind of tunnel intrusion into the side
of this mountain, and you only

1115
01:12:32,326 --> 01:12:34,295
get that much of opening.

1116
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:36,068
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1117
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:38,077
TALIESIN: No, this is an excellent start.

1118
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:43,880
MARISHA: All right. In spelunker-Keyleth mode, I'm
looking through the hole with my Darkvision.

1119
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,543
MATT: Okay, perception check.

1120
01:12:45,543 --> 01:12:46,637
MARISHA: What do I see?

1121
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:48,323
LIAM: Fanart, please.

1122
01:12:48,323 --> 01:12:50,635
MATT: Keyleth in The Descent.

1123
01:12:50,635 --> 01:12:53,359
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch! That's a one.

1124
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:55,181
LAURA: What do you see, Keyleth?

1125
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:56,623
LIAM: You just got James Franco'd.

1126
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:59,093
MARISHA: It's so fucking dark, you guys.

1127
01:12:59,093 --> 01:13:08,771
LAURA: How about I try-- Oh! What if we light an
arrow, can I do an Oracle Arrow through the hole?

1128
01:13:08,771 --> 01:13:13,527
MARISHA: I shimmy out and say, Vex, go in the
hole.

1129
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:23,348
MATT: Okay. All right. So you pull back the arrow,
you fire it through. The arrow-- go ahead and make

1130
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:25,239
an attack roll.

1131
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:29,402
LAURA: I'm getting death looks. Natural 20!

1132
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:35,697
MATT: You fire the Oracle Arrow at just the right
angle where it doesn't hit any of the walls, it

1133
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:42,630
just arcs off straight, before it eventually
begins to curve. And what you do as you pass along

1134
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:48,276
with this arrow, with your Darkvision, you can
see, down the tunnel there is no light source.

1135
01:13:48,276 --> 01:13:57,639
There is a layer of untouched dust all across the
ground, and interesting texture the further in you

1136
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:06,449
go. And then eventually, about 100 feet or so in,
the tunnel begins to curve to the left and descend

1137
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:11,763
before the arrow lands and sticks into the rock
there, splintering a little bit, and your vision

1138
01:14:11,763 --> 01:14:17,818
now sits there with the arrow. There doesn't
appear to be any movement. It is silent and

1139
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:18,835
pitch-black.

1140
01:14:18,835 --> 01:14:21,103
LAURA: Okay. And nothing had walked, it didn't
look like there were any tracks.

1141
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:22,534
It was just heavy dust.

1142
01:14:22,534 --> 01:14:24,833
MATT: From what you could see from the arrow
rushing past it, yeah.

1143
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,719
LIAM: And that gap is just this much?

1144
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,058
MATT: It's about that big, yeah.

1145
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:30,735
LIAM: And does it go in like that, like a long
tunnel of that, or is it--

1146
01:14:30,735 --> 01:14:32,318
could I reach my arm through?

1147
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:34,618
MATT: You could reach your arm through.
Essentially, it's like the edge of the wall of

1148
01:14:34,618 --> 01:14:40,201
this tunnel and the rock were kind of jammed
together, and she punched through just enough to

1149
01:14:40,201 --> 01:14:45,626
push past where the rock and the wall had hit, and
it created this slight opening, but there's still

1150
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:47,168
a bunch of stone there.

1151
01:14:47,168 --> 01:14:48,410
LIAM: Shit.

1152
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,015
TALIESIN: It's okay, there's options.

1153
01:14:50,015 --> 01:14:52,886
LAURA: I shimmy out. It's just a tunnel.

1154
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:54,769
TALIESIN: That's good.

1155
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:56,155
LAURA: Yeah, it's a long tunnel.

1156
01:14:56,155 --> 01:15:01,036
PATRICK: That means we could make a little bit of
noise getting in here, maybe.

1157
01:15:01,036 --> 01:15:07,919
LAURA: Potentially. Raishan, I think, has rather
good hearing. If we make a lot of noise, it might

1158
01:15:07,919 --> 01:15:09,134
echo down.

1159
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,929
PATRICK: Right.

1160
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:16,225
TALIESIN: We have no way of keeping silent, do we?
We don't have any way of--

1161
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:25,357
MARISHA: I could try, like what you said. I can
always, worst-case scenario, burn another

1162
01:15:25,357 --> 01:15:28,378
4th-level to finish this off.

1163
01:15:28,378 --> 01:15:30,034
TRAVIS: For a door?

1164
01:15:30,034 --> 01:15:32,848
TALIESIN: We've spent more opening a door.

1165
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:34,678
MARISHA: Yes, we have.

1166
01:15:34,678 --> 01:15:37,083
TRAVIS: We don't have to spend anything. I'll just
beat the shit out of it.

1167
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,758
TALIESIN: You're our last resort at this point.

1168
01:15:38,758 --> 01:15:40,688
LAURA: But you do have siege gauntlets, though.

1169
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:45,559
TRAVIS: I do, yeah. I actually have those, like,
no one's taken them from me.

1170
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:48,353
(laughter)

1171
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:51,234
LIAM: Why do you say that right now? How is that
relevant to the conversation at hand?

1172
01:15:51,234 --> 01:15:58,903
TRAVIS: I just mean, like, they're mine, you know.
They work for me, they speak to me. Yeah.

1173
01:15:58,903 --> 01:16:00,903
LIAM: I've always said as much.

1174
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:04,289
MARISHA: Do you have a relationship with all of
your inanimate objects?

1175
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:05,951
TRAVIS: I try to work on it at night.

1176
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:07,072
MARISHA: Sure.

1177
01:16:07,072 --> 01:16:10,798
TALIESIN: Wow, I actually do blame myself for
this. This is interesting.

1178
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:13,291
MARISHA: Why would you say that, Percy?

1179
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:14,886
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1180
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:17,498
MARISHA: Man, I feel like there's a lot of
secrets.

1181
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:21,878
LAURA: What do you think? Should we burn another
4th, or should we have Grog punch the little hole

1182
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,176
a little bit?

1183
01:16:23,176 --> 01:16:24,973
MARISHA: Well, let me see. I crawl back in the
hole.

1184
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:26,242
MATT: Okay.

1185
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:27,578
MARISHA: All right.

1186
01:16:27,578 --> 01:16:28,988
MATT: All right.

1187
01:16:28,988 --> 01:16:39,111
MARISHA: You know how, like, a blade of grass can
break a block of concrete?

1188
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:40,889
LAURA: What?

1189
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:43,088
MARISHA: I'm doing some monk shit, all right?

1190
01:16:43,088 --> 01:16:45,145
(laughter)

1191
01:16:45,173 --> 01:16:59,967
MARISHA: Okay. Go with me. Okay. You know how
plants can break stone when they grow through? If

1192
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:07,944
I do a Druidcraft cantrip and try and grow some
plants through this hole, will it maybe help crack

1193
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:08,991
open a bigger hole?

1194
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,131
TRAVIS: Can you fast-forward 1000 years?

1195
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,685
MATT: (creeper hissing)

1196
01:17:12,685 --> 01:17:20,979
MARISHA: No, creeper. No creeper. Okay. I shimmy
back out and I say, no, apparently that takes like

1197
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:22,179
1000 years.

1198
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,087
(laughter)

1199
01:17:24,087 --> 01:17:28,017
LAURA: Grog. You wanna go punch some shit?

1200
01:17:28,017 --> 01:17:39,358
PATRICK: Hold on for one second. I know you can move this
stone, if it allows you to only move certain parts

1201
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:50,362
of it, could you use the stone you can shape to
effectively carve out a chunk that could be pulled

1202
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:59,280
out? Like a very thin, narrow, like just move as
much as a finger's-width around and then we could

1203
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,743
pull that out instead of just pushing it all the
way like clay?

1204
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:06,758
MATT: I mean, it could be, but one spell's already
been spent.

1205
01:18:06,758 --> 01:18:08,685
LAURA: So it would just be another spell slot.

1206
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:09,923
MATT: But it would work.

1207
01:18:09,923 --> 01:18:14,491
PATRICK: It would be another spell, but that would
be just two to get in, as opposed to endlessly

1208
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:17,171
throwing spell after spell at this.

1209
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:21,658
LAURA: Well, Grog has siege gauntlets, so he could
potentially do some damage to the rock, but it

1210
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:22,929
would make noise.

1211
01:18:22,929 --> 01:18:27,789
LIAM: One second. Percy. I have a nutball idea
that maybe you could turn into a better one.

1212
01:18:27,789 --> 01:18:29,890
LAURA: Doors!

1213
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:34,832
LIAM: I pull out the Oil of Etherealness that I've
been carrying for ages.

1214
01:18:34,832 --> 01:18:36,111
MARISHA: The What of Whatness?

1215
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:39,582
LIAM: This, it's goop, you rub it on yourself and
you become ethereal for an hour.

1216
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,595
But I can't do it.

1217
01:18:41,595 --> 01:18:42,868
LAURA: Why?

1218
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:48,473
LIAM: There's not enough to cover me. But Scanlan
could do it or Pike could do it and could walk

1219
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,027
through the rock.

1220
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,446
LAURA: And then do what?

1221
01:18:51,446 --> 01:18:56,133
LIAM: Look around, see if there's anything to-- I
don't know. I prefaced it with saying it was a

1222
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:59,496
shitty idea, and I spoke to the brain to see if he
could come up with something better.

1223
01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:01,386
TRAVIS: We looked for a switch, right?

1224
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:03,972
MARISHA: It's a giant rock. It's a boulder.

1225
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,334
TALIESIN: With handholds on it. It's Fortress of
Solitude.

1226
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:08,472
TRAVIS: Can I look for a switch?

1227
01:19:08,472 --> 01:19:10,397
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1228
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:16,857
TRAVIS: If I solve this... 19. Oh, minus... 17.

1229
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:21,243
MATT: 17. Looking around as they're having this
conversation, there's no switches, but you do see

1230
01:19:21,243 --> 01:19:26,643
fingerholds, like big, dragon-sized fingerholds,
like something grabbed it and jammed this boulder

1231
01:19:26,643 --> 01:19:27,874
in there.

1232
01:19:27,874 --> 01:19:33,497
PATRICK: I actually want to kind of take a look
around, too, because if this is a naturally formed

1233
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:40,656
rock, a naturally formed opening, this is not like
a cork in a bottle. There has to be some parts

1234
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:49,493
that don't fit really smoothly. Have we found the
best place to make our incursion? Is there an

1235
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:55,218
opening? Is there any-- this can't fit snugly into
this unless it's been shaped for that purpose.

1236
01:19:55,218 --> 01:20:04,839
TALIESIN: We can now get enough of a hold to make
a lever and move the boulder out a little bit, get

1237
01:20:04,839 --> 01:20:10,382
us all in, and then drop it back into place. In
theory. We have this hole now that's big enough

1238
01:20:10,382 --> 01:20:17,333
for, let's say, a magical weapon that can't be
destroyed? And we can just apply as much pressure,

1239
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:21,268
put a bunch of other people pushing on the other
side and see if we can open it up enough to get in

1240
01:20:21,268 --> 01:20:23,002
and then let it close behind us.

1241
01:20:23,002 --> 01:20:25,278
LIAM: How would Bigby be in this situation?

1242
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:27,443
MARISHA: Bigby would be an upper-level spell.

1243
01:20:27,443 --> 01:20:29,700
TALIESIN: I don't want to burn that right now.

1244
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:37,116
MARISHA: Grog. Do you want to try and use some of
your basic mechanics of physics? Of leveraging?

1245
01:20:37,116 --> 01:20:42,767
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is, but I will
assault this stone with a quickness.

1246
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:44,472
LAURA: Do it! Just get us in.

1247
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:50,164
MARISHA: Don't assault it. Don't insul-- don't
insult or assault it. If you could just--

1248
01:20:50,164 --> 01:20:52,085
TRAVIS: There's no joy in either of them.

1249
01:20:52,085 --> 01:20:55,021
MARISHA: I know. I know. This one isn't for you.

1250
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:59,176
TALIESIN: Who's got a magical weapon that's very
long?

1251
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:00,455
TRAVIS: Kima.

1252
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:07,215
MARISHA: If you could take Kima's sword, pry open
a crack, let us slip in--

1253
01:21:07,215 --> 01:21:09,902
TRAVIS: You ask Kima for the Holy Avenger, I'm not
taking that.

1254
01:21:09,902 --> 01:21:12,009
MARISHA: Well, don't you have the dragon sword?

1255
01:21:12,009 --> 01:21:14,826
TRAVIS: You ask Kima for her sword. See how that
goes.

1256
01:21:14,826 --> 01:21:15,889
TALIESIN: Kima.

1257
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:17,290
MATT: "Yes?"

1258
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:22,941
TALIESIN: We're thinking about building a giant
lever. Could you put your sword in that hole and

1259
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:25,804
help us pull very, very hard to see if we can move
this boulder?

1260
01:21:25,883 --> 01:21:28,440
MATT: "Will it damage the sword?"

1261
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,737
TALIESIN: In theory, no.

1262
01:21:29,737 --> 01:21:31,099
LAURA: In theory.

1263
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:33,667
TALIESIN: It's a magical sword. Can you break a
magical sword with pressure?

1264
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:37,647
MATT: "You ding it, you pay."

1265
01:21:37,647 --> 01:21:47,417
TALIESIN: That's fair. So I'm going to try and
build this lever. All of us are going to

1266
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:51,111
put pressure in the other direction, we're going
to try and have as many of us moving this thing

1267
01:21:51,111 --> 01:21:56,460
just a couple feet. Not far. Just far enough to
make an opening to get as many of us through as

1268
01:21:56,517 --> 01:21:57,764
possible.

1269
01:21:57,764 --> 01:22:00,742
MATT: All right, so who's doing the leverage?

1270
01:22:00,742 --> 01:22:01,930
LIAM: Pike is.

1271
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,750
LAURA and MARISHA: Definitely Pike.

1272
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:08,177
MATT: Okay, well, the size of the sword, at most
it's going to be one person assisting the main

1273
01:22:08,177 --> 01:22:13,864
person. Which would be Pike assisting Grog. All
right. So as the rest of you guys get on the other

1274
01:22:13,864 --> 01:22:17,695
side, Grog, I want you to go ahead and roll a
strength check.

1275
01:22:17,695 --> 01:22:19,814
MARISHA: Pike and Grog, Pike and Grog.

1276
01:22:19,814 --> 01:22:22,381
MATT: With advantage because of Pike's aid on
this.

1277
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:27,057
TRAVIS: Thank god. 23.

1278
01:22:27,057 --> 01:22:34,230
MATT: 23, okay. As you guys get on the other side,
before you even start getting into position, Grog

1279
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:38,579
already begins to pull back on the sword. You
watch as Kima keeps glancing over her shoulder

1280
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:47,697
like (worried noise). Waiting for it to just snap.
But the large rock, the boulder begins to shift

1281
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:52,438
ever-so-slightly. You watch as dust and other
small pebbles begin to clatter down the outside of

1282
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:56,994
the rock. You all get on the other side and, all
together as a group,

1283
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,399
everyone else make strength checks.

1284
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:03,366
PATRICK: We can use the rod of immobility to brace
it if we need to.

1285
01:23:03,366 --> 01:23:06,770
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good call, because we have
two of them, now.

1286
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:08,389
MARISHA: Oh, that's such a good idea.

1287
01:23:08,389 --> 01:23:11,845
TALIESIN: We have holes drilled in the stone by
dragon feet.

1288
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:17,021
MARISHA: We can just wedge it in there. Yeah.
That's a good call, you guys. Wait, we're all

1289
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:18,596
doing a strength check?

1290
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:19,975
LAURA: 12.

1291
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:20,969
MARISHA: Just straight strength?

1292
01:23:20,969 --> 01:23:23,360
MATT: Straight strength, so add your strength
modifier.

1293
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,349
TALIESIN: 17.

1294
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:25,302
MARISHA: 13.

1295
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:26,507
LIAM: 16.

1296
01:23:26,507 --> 01:23:27,899
LAURA: Did you want Pike's?

1297
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:29,496
LIAM: To do what, help prop it up?

1298
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:33,295
TALIESIN: Scanlan rolled a four.

1299
01:23:33,295 --> 01:23:40,711
MATT: Okay. Okay. So you manage to get about a
foot and a half--

1300
01:23:40,711 --> 01:23:43,074
LAURA: Trinket rolled a 19.

1301
01:23:43,074 --> 01:23:47,762
MATT: Okay. So Trinket's also pushing as well.
There isn't a whole lot of surface area here to

1302
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:53,675
really aid, it's mostly on you, Grog, and you
manage to get about a foot and a half wide before

1303
01:23:53,675 --> 01:24:00,403
you pull out the Immovable Rods and Kerrek, and
anybody else who wants to help, you manage to jam

1304
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:07,538
them into two of the finger-holes, and as soon as they
lock in, you can release the weapon and it's just

1305
01:24:07,538 --> 01:24:14,859
enough to hold it in place, although it is slowly
moving. Each rod can only hold 8,000 pounds. Mind

1306
01:24:14,859 --> 01:24:18,954
you, it's not holding it entirely aloft, it seems
to be holding okay for now.

1307
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:21,966
LIAM: I immediately throw Whisper through the
crack and bamf through.

1308
01:24:21,966 --> 01:24:23,452
TALIESIN: I scootch.

1309
01:24:23,452 --> 01:24:24,440
LAURA: I scootch.

1310
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,334
MATT: You guys all pull through. Kima immediately
rushes and grabs the sword. You guys charge into

1311
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:28,337
the darkness.

1312
01:24:28,337 --> 01:24:31,863
LAURA: Can Trinket get in or do I need to bamf him
in the necklace and bamf him out? Okay, that's

1313
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:33,012
what I do.

1314
01:24:33,012 --> 01:24:36,870
MATT: You guys all do get inside the tunnel. The
boulder does appear to be stationary.

1315
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:43,461
LAURA: Should we leave it open, or should we take
the rods? We might need to get out in a hurry.

1316
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:48,057
TALIESIN: What a wonderfully convenient way to
close. And it also means that the dragon will not

1317
01:24:48,057 --> 01:24:50,124
be able to open the door.

1318
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:51,471
MARISHA: Because it's wedged?

1319
01:24:51,471 --> 01:24:52,687
TALIESIN: It's wedged shut.

1320
01:24:52,687 --> 01:25:00,257
MARISHA: She could turn into a person. She can
also teleport. Let's not forget that. Okay, let's

1321
01:25:00,257 --> 01:25:01,413
keep going.

1322
01:25:01,413 --> 01:25:03,317
MATT: All right.

1323
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:07,635
TALIESIN: Just, let's remember to pick those up,
if there's anybody left to get them.

1324
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:14,031
MATT: You guys now stand in the 15-foot-wide,
about 12-foot-tall, tunnel entrance to this

1325
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:20,722
mountainside. As you saw before, the floor itself
has a layer of dust. There's a heavy smell of

1326
01:25:20,722 --> 01:25:33,891
ancient rot and stagnant water and wet earth. The
rock walls of the pathway are rough, but appear to

1327
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:38,400
have been intentionally carved for a purpose more
than any sort of presentational element of it.

1328
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:44,863
There's no wind, there's no movement of air.
Everything in here has been, at least in this

1329
01:25:44,863 --> 01:25:51,498
portion of it, still and untouched for quite some
time. As you guys push forward through this

1330
01:25:51,498 --> 01:25:54,360
tunnel, to where it begins to make its slow
descent--

1331
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,725
LAURA: Stealth.

1332
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:57,543
MATT: You guys? All right.

1333
01:25:57,543 --> 01:26:06,907
LIAM: Checking, checking, checking. 24.

1334
01:26:06,907 --> 01:26:11,268
LAURA: Oh, this is investigation.

1335
01:26:11,268 --> 01:26:12,981
TALIESIN: I thought you were stealthing.

1336
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:14,955
LAURA: Oh, was that a stealth roll or an
investigation roll?

1337
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:16,459
That was investigation, right?

1338
01:26:16,459 --> 01:26:18,614
MATT: That was investigation. 24?

1339
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:20,119
LAURA: Dogshit. 11.

1340
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:25,464
MATT: Okay. We'll have to make-- we'll say, make
new stealth checks since you guys have come out of

1341
01:26:25,464 --> 01:26:32,311
stealth and you're back in. But as you guys are
moving down the curvature of the tunnel, Vax, you

1342
01:26:32,311 --> 01:26:40,591
notice that there are, amongst the dust and
pebbles of the floor, small pieces and chunks of

1343
01:26:40,591 --> 01:26:48,865
other material. Most of them very small, maybe
anywhere from a pebble size to the size of this

1344
01:26:48,865 --> 01:26:54,977
die or a little larger. And they're different than
the rock, they're a lighter material, and almost

1345
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:57,837
porous upon close look, as you take one and look
at it.

1346
01:26:57,837 --> 01:27:05,153
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth, come up here, please.
Do you know what that is?

1347
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,366
MARISHA: What is it?

1348
01:27:07,366 --> 01:27:13,436
MATT: You've seen this before, actually, in a
subterranean place once before, although it was a

1349
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:18,521
large field of it at the time. There are a number
of scattered shards of bone, just kind of

1350
01:27:18,521 --> 01:27:23,986
scattered and cracked and broken across the floor.
Not a very thick mat, but just here and there,

1351
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:26,310
peppered throughout the walkway.

1352
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:30,420
MARISHA: These are dead things. This is bone.
Yeah.

1353
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,311
MATT: You also do notice, upon looking at a few of
them on the ground, now having the context, a lot

1354
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:38,633
of them look blackened, a lot of them look like
they've been charred, burnt.

1355
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:41,209
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth.

1356
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:42,346
MARISHA: Yeah?

1357
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:47,678
LAURA: When you did the scrying thing, how long
did it take to get down in the tunnels? Was it a

1358
01:27:47,678 --> 01:27:50,204
lot of tunnels before you got to the laboratory?

1359
01:27:50,204 --> 01:27:52,101
MARISHA: In terms of my vision?

1360
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:53,210
LAURA: Yeah.

1361
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:56,296
MATT: You don't know. It looked like you're at
this point, and then you're there.

1362
01:27:56,296 --> 01:27:58,145
So you have no idea.

1363
01:27:58,145 --> 01:28:00,198
LAURA: It's less than a mile down, I know.

1364
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:03,906
MARISHA: It kind of rushes past you really fast,
it's a little disorienting.

1365
01:28:03,906 --> 01:28:06,245
LAURA: Okay.

1366
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:08,352
LIAM: No traps?

1367
01:28:08,352 --> 01:28:10,332
MATT: No traps at the moment, no.

1368
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:12,192
LAURA: Should we all stealth?

1369
01:28:12,192 --> 01:28:16,047
PATRICK: These are just here so that people step
on them and it makes noise?

1370
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:21,760
LIAM: It's a theory. We already stealthed.

1371
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,658
LAURA: I thought we had to reroll stealth.

1372
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:25,052
LIAM: Oh, I did.

1373
01:28:25,052 --> 01:28:30,412
MARISHA: Can I do a-- this is some CSI shit.

1374
01:28:30,412 --> 01:28:33,703
MATT: You guys are going stealth, right? All
right, so roll your stealth checks, please.

1375
01:28:33,703 --> 01:28:35,396
TRAVIS: Plus ten?

1376
01:28:35,396 --> 01:28:36,486
LAURA: 30.

1377
01:28:36,486 --> 01:28:37,714
LIAM: 35.

1378
01:28:37,714 --> 01:28:41,843
TALIESIN: 34. And then Scanlan...

1379
01:28:41,843 --> 01:28:43,347
MARISHA: 30 total.

1380
01:28:43,347 --> 01:28:44,505
TRAVIS: 28.

1381
01:28:44,505 --> 01:28:45,682
LAURA: 25 for Pike.

1382
01:28:45,682 --> 01:28:49,901
TRAVIS: No, sorry. Oh, 30.

1383
01:28:49,901 --> 01:28:51,919
TALIESIN: 18 for Scanlan.

1384
01:28:51,919 --> 01:28:54,278
PATRICK: 29 for me.

1385
01:28:54,278 --> 01:29:01,079
MATT: Great, awesome. All right, so, as you guys
continue progressing down this curving tunnel, it

1386
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:05,266
goes into a very, very mild descent.

1387
01:29:05,266 --> 01:29:15,430
MARISHA: Can I do-- I wanna do a quick check. This
is some Bones-type shit. Can I see if these bones

1388
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:21,204
were charred recently, or once again, if these
bones have been there for a long time? I know this

1389
01:29:21,204 --> 01:29:23,476
is some weird carbon-dating shit.

1390
01:29:23,476 --> 01:29:29,618
MATT: Make a nature check on this, actually. This
is your understanding at least of how fire against

1391
01:29:29,618 --> 01:29:30,731
bone, which is--

1392
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:32,266
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 28.

1393
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:38,311
MATT: 28. Yeah, so understanding especially in the
Pyrah, and noticing the difference and just your

1394
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:43,887
experience of natural animals and creatures that
have been cooked to be eaten, and the effect of

1395
01:29:43,887 --> 01:29:54,765
the fire on the bones that are left behind, this
bone charring is not as ancient as, say, the trees

1396
01:29:54,765 --> 01:30:02,048
that have withered, but they're aren't-- they're
years old at the very least, if not longer.

1397
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:04,562
MARISHA: Years old, if not longer.

1398
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:08,494
MATT: Yeah, there's a layer of dust on these
bones, as well, that shows that at least they have

1399
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:10,375
been untouched for a short time.

1400
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:14,131
MARISHA: Okay. But wait, was Thordak here over a
year ago?

1401
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:15,813
TALIESIN: Could have been, yeah.

1402
01:30:15,813 --> 01:30:22,710
LAURA: He was here for a long time before-- he was
here before he got the thing, right?

1403
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:30,425
MATT: Yeah. He made this his lair after avoiding
death from J'mon Sa Ord in Ank'harel, and then

1404
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:36,739
recuperated here, from what you know, and then
made this his domain for a while, and then pressed

1405
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:38,754
northward in Tal'Dorei, which is where--

1406
01:30:38,754 --> 01:30:40,802
MARISHA: That's when Allura and her team
encountered him.

1407
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:46,445
MATT: Correct. That's when Thordak battled Raishan
and began the beginning of the formulation of the

1408
01:30:46,445 --> 01:30:54,597
Conclave, that's when Thordak destroyed Byroden
and by proxy, their mother. That's when all of

1409
01:30:54,597 --> 01:30:56,125
that went down.

1410
01:30:56,125 --> 01:31:00,830
LIAM: While we're quiet here, in the dark, I pull
Pike over to the side. Pike!

1411
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,702
LAURA: Yes?

1412
01:31:02,702 --> 01:31:11,541
LIAM: I have a bad-- will you take care of my
sister? You have that one thing that you do, I

1413
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:17,679
don't know what it's called, but if she falls
down, she gets back up again. Do you know what I'm

1414
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:18,740
talking about?

1415
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:25,259
LAURA: Is that the Death Ward? It's a thing. I
talk to Sarenrae and then she protects them for a

1416
01:31:25,259 --> 01:31:26,850
little bit of time.

1417
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:29,733
LIAM: Could you do that to my sister now?

1418
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:32,191
LAURA: Feels a little selfish, but sure.

1419
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:34,101
(laughter)

1420
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:38,709
LIAM: I thought of it.

1421
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:42,955
LAURA: I mean, if you want me to do it.

1422
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,869
LIAM: I do, I do.

1423
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:55,628
LAURA: Sure, why not? I walk up to me. I guess
Pike will cast Death Ward on Vex.

1424
01:31:55,628 --> 01:32:02,111
MATT: Okay. So that's a 4th-level spell off Pike,
and for the next eight hours,

1425
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:04,164
Vex is Death Warded.

1426
01:32:04,164 --> 01:32:08,664
LIAM: When you're brought down to zero, you ping
up to one, is the math on that.

1427
01:32:08,664 --> 01:32:14,541
MARISHA: It's kind of like buying Starbucks with
the company Amex.

1428
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:18,009
LAURA: Feels a little weird, not gonna lie.

1429
01:32:18,009 --> 01:32:26,327
LIAM: It's just strategy, man. Game strategy.
Well, it's done, and my sister is a little safer

1430
01:32:26,327 --> 01:32:28,883
than she was before, and y'all can go fuck
yourselves.

1431
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:32,339
MARISHA: So easy when you have the pin code.

1432
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:35,155
(laughter)

1433
01:32:35,155 --> 01:32:39,100
LIAM: This one and this one on me.

1434
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,376
LAURA: Yeah, it's totally cool.

1435
01:32:43,376 --> 01:32:51,345
LIAM: Out of character, Matt pooped out this new
feature to dying, and she's on her last fucking

1436
01:32:51,345 --> 01:32:54,900
string, man. No regrets, move forward.

1437
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,542
MATT: To be fair, I'm still toying with it,
because it's one of the things that I'm adjusting

1438
01:32:58,542 --> 01:32:59,736
as we go.

1439
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:02,003
LIAM: Well, you said it and the spell is cast.

1440
01:33:02,003 --> 01:33:03,457
MATT: That's not true at all.

1441
01:33:03,457 --> 01:33:05,221
MARISHA: You freaked everyone out, Matt.

1442
01:33:05,221 --> 01:33:06,935
MATT: Oh, I can keep it if you want.

1443
01:33:06,935 --> 01:33:08,872
MARISHA: No, don't worry about it.

1444
01:33:08,872 --> 01:33:13,009
TALIESIN: You're literally wearing a creeper
shirt, you have to be careful what you say. God,

1445
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:14,384
every time.

1446
01:33:14,384 --> 01:33:20,308
MATT: It's a rule that I'm working with. I may
have jumped the gun in releasing it at the time as

1447
01:33:20,308 --> 01:33:24,497
I'm working on the campaign guide, but one of the
resurrection rules, I was deciding the DC, I think

1448
01:33:24,497 --> 01:33:29,502
five per death is a bit intense, so I might adjust
it more to be a two. Just 'cause I was thinking,

1449
01:33:29,502 --> 01:33:34,027
in a long-term campaign, your character might die
a lot more between levels one and 20. And then it

1450
01:33:34,027 --> 01:33:36,582
gets a little insane. So I'm working on it.

1451
01:33:36,582 --> 01:33:39,925
LIAM: Listen, I help my sister, okay?

1452
01:33:39,925 --> 01:33:43,649
MATT: Mind you, she's still closer to death, but yes.

1453
01:33:43,649 --> 01:33:46,634
MARISHA: Mind you, she's still closer to death.

1454
01:33:46,634 --> 01:33:51,426
PATRICK: Just to ask a little bit, as we're going
down here, I don't know how everyone else is

1455
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:57,100
geared up, but I'm kind of vanilla human here, and
not that equipped to see in the dark.

1456
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:03,466
MATT: Yeah, in fact, currently Percival and Kerrek
are blind. Like, pitch-black blind.

1457
01:34:03,466 --> 01:34:05,678
LAURA: Wait, light your little dagger up.

1458
01:34:05,678 --> 01:34:07,154
MATT: All right--

1459
01:34:07,154 --> 01:34:12,874
PATRICK: Actually, you probably just hear Kerrek
say, I am sorry, but at this point

1460
01:34:12,874 --> 01:34:16,855
I can't see at all.

1461
01:34:16,855 --> 01:34:23,392
LIAM: I'm always holding two, and one of them is,
I pull out the Flametongue Dagger, and I wave a

1462
01:34:23,392 --> 01:34:24,464
fly away--

1463
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:25,856
LAURA: This gnat, this fucking gnat.

1464
01:34:25,856 --> 01:34:31,577
LIAM: And I hold it so that Kerrek can see, and I
say, we might die, so try it one more time with

1465
01:34:31,577 --> 01:34:37,601
me. Irish wristwatch. Just once more, before we
die.

1466
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:41,100
PATRICK: I dreamed about this last night.

1467
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:44,977
(laughter)

1468
01:34:44,977 --> 01:34:47,097
TALIESIN: It's a tough one.

1469
01:34:47,097 --> 01:34:50,471
PATRICK: Irish wr-- (laughs)

1470
01:34:50,471 --> 01:34:52,779
(cheering)

1471
01:34:52,779 --> 01:34:54,073
PATRICK: Irish wristwatch.

1472
01:34:54,073 --> 01:34:55,866
(cheering)

1473
01:34:55,866 --> 01:34:57,647
MATT: There you go. Well done.

1474
01:34:57,647 --> 01:35:00,419
LIAM: I feel so much closer to you now. Let's
fucking do this.

1475
01:35:00,419 --> 01:35:06,972
MATT: The dagger, which emits flame on it, is the
equivalent of a candle. He can see about 15 feet

1476
01:35:06,972 --> 01:35:08,490
beyond you, and that's it.

1477
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:14,477
PATRICK: Well, actually, I'll say, as soon as I
say, are we okay with light? Or are we trying to

1478
01:35:14,477 --> 01:35:16,722
keep it as dark as possible? Because--

1479
01:35:16,722 --> 01:35:17,831
LIAM: Too late now.

1480
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:19,004
LAURA: A little bit of light.

1481
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:20,019
LIAM: There's a candle.

1482
01:35:20,019 --> 01:35:25,035
MATT: There is now a flame licking the edge of the
blade that's being held aloft. So light is being

1483
01:35:25,035 --> 01:35:27,229
shed now in the tunnel. Though not a lot.

1484
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:30,876
TRAVIS: You know, you could put that out and they
could just grab onto each one of our arms

1485
01:35:30,876 --> 01:35:32,021
and move forward.

1486
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:33,524
MARISHA: Yeah, I go and find Percy.

1487
01:35:33,524 --> 01:35:34,624
TALIESIN: Okay.

1488
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:35,948
MARISHA: And I link arms.

1489
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:37,817
TRAVIS: Oh, jeez. Hey, Kerr, you wanna cuddle?

1490
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:39,844
PATRICK: Actually, yes.

1491
01:35:39,844 --> 01:35:42,297
(laughter)

1492
01:35:42,297 --> 01:35:44,366
TRAVIS: Hey, Vax. Put that light out.

1493
01:35:44,366 --> 01:35:49,834
MATT: All right, so Kerrek, there's a moment of
quiet and stillness in the darkness, as you feel

1494
01:35:49,834 --> 01:35:57,539
the ground beneath you shift ever-so-slightly.
Heavy footfalls approaching you as suddenly a

1495
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:03,010
large, muscled, somewhat sweaty arm just curls
around the outside of your shoulders and pulls you

1496
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:05,964
close to Grog's torso.

1497
01:36:05,964 --> 01:36:10,159
PATRICK: It is one of the most comforting things I
have ever experienced.

1498
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,919
(laughter)

1499
01:36:12,919 --> 01:36:17,086
TRAVIS: I love it. I love it!

1500
01:36:17,086 --> 01:36:21,113
LIAM: We're about to die.

1501
01:36:21,113 --> 01:36:23,589
LAURA: No, no, no.

1502
01:36:23,589 --> 01:36:27,436
MARISHA: Okay, I kinda guide Percy as we go
through.

1503
01:36:27,436 --> 01:36:34,816
MATT: So you guys are making your way down this
slow grade beneath. Yes.

1504
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:38,332
MARISHA: Being stealthy as fuck.

1505
01:36:38,332 --> 01:36:44,527
MATT: You make incremental checks as we go.
Eventually, as the grade continues downward, you

1506
01:36:44,527 --> 01:36:51,154
begin to see the hallway open up ever-so-slightly,
and what was once just somewhat rough rock walls begin

1507
01:36:51,154 --> 01:37:00,745
having slight shapes or details to them. It's
still hard to see. Darkvision is-- you still need

1508
01:37:00,745 --> 01:37:04,209
a little light to make out fine details or things
at a distance, but it does help you at least make

1509
01:37:04,209 --> 01:37:10,318
out the basic shapes and things ahead of you. You
see what appear to be small shelves or alcoves

1510
01:37:10,318 --> 01:37:17,195
that are now beginning to show up every 20 or so
feet as you progress down. Little bits of rock

1511
01:37:17,195 --> 01:37:24,301
that jut out that look like they were either
bolted in or crafted on top of it, and you see

1512
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:28,652
small, little cubbies, almost, little alcoves that
are put into the rock as well.

1513
01:37:28,652 --> 01:37:31,519
LAURA: Hold your little dagger up to it, I want to
see what it is.

1514
01:37:31,519 --> 01:37:32,714
LIAM: You're sure?

1515
01:37:32,714 --> 01:37:33,906
LAURA: Yeah.

1516
01:37:33,906 --> 01:37:37,375
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1517
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:42,422
LIAM: That's pretty good. That is 29.

1518
01:37:42,422 --> 01:37:48,518
MATT: Okay. You glance in the first one to your
immediate right, which is a small shelf outward,

1519
01:37:48,518 --> 01:37:56,400
and you see what appear to be a number of
dust-covered-- a cluster of candles that have long

1520
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:01,631
burned and melted into dripping wax that pours
down the side of this alcove. That's it on that

1521
01:38:01,631 --> 01:38:03,149
particular shelf.

1522
01:38:03,149 --> 01:38:10,119
LAURA: Careful. Maybe keep it out, just keep an
eye out. It's hard to see down here.

1523
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:12,393
LIAM: I can look at these after.

1524
01:38:12,393 --> 01:38:16,580
LAURA: No, I just, I mean for traps. Psh.

1525
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:20,463
MATT: Okay. So you're searching for traps now?

1526
01:38:20,463 --> 01:38:21,913
LIAM: Constantly.

1527
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:25,239
MATT: Go ahead and make another investigation
check with disadvantage.

1528
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:29,264
LAURA: 'Cause it's dark. See? If you'd pulled your
dagger out, it wouldn't be so bad.

1529
01:38:29,264 --> 01:38:32,157
LIAM: Good suggestion. Still at disadvantage?

1530
01:38:32,157 --> 01:38:34,219
LAURA: If his dagger's out?

1531
01:38:34,219 --> 01:38:41,058
MATT: Let me double-check, here. It's kind of a
frustratingly broken ability in some cases if it

1532
01:38:41,058 --> 01:38:43,112
just is universally in here.

1533
01:38:43,112 --> 01:38:50,156
LAURA: I'm gonna pull out the flying carpet.
(laughs) And I'm gonna walk over to--

1534
01:38:50,156 --> 01:38:53,178
MATT: So you can see in dim light within 60 feet
of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness

1535
01:38:53,178 --> 01:39:01,309
as if it were dim light, so you have about 15 feet
you can kind of see out in front of you in

1536
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:05,420
straight darkness. If you have your dagger out,
you can see pretty decently for 60 feet,

1537
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,153
is how it works.

1538
01:39:07,153 --> 01:39:09,569
LIAM: But if it's gone, I can see 15 feet ahead?

1539
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,321
MATT: Kinda shitty in 15 feet.

1540
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:15,624
LAURA: I'm gonna give the--

1541
01:39:15,718 --> 01:39:18,796
LIAM: So regular checks, if the dagger's out.

1542
01:39:18,831 --> 01:39:22,264
MATT: For, at least, 60 feet for you.

1543
01:39:22,264 --> 01:39:25,757
LIAM: And this is investigation. 18.

1544
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:33,146
MATT: Okay. Nothing seems to catch your attention.
As you continue pushing forward, you see one more

1545
01:39:33,146 --> 01:39:35,323
of these shelves. Are you looking at each one as
you go?

1546
01:39:35,323 --> 01:39:36,866
LIAM: Yeah, right now I am.

1547
01:39:36,866 --> 01:39:39,382
MATT: Okay. As you glance past, another perception
check.

1548
01:39:39,382 --> 01:39:43,496
LAURA: Hey, Grog. So I have this flying carpet...

1549
01:39:43,496 --> 01:39:44,807
LIAM: 22.

1550
01:39:44,807 --> 01:39:52,722
MATT: 22. Okay. You can see on the left shelf
appears to be a humanoid skull that's up on top,

1551
01:39:52,722 --> 01:40:00,434
next to two more candles, one of them more melted
than the other, but the wax drips past. There's a

1552
01:40:00,434 --> 01:40:05,976
shelf across the way on the opposite side that
appears to have a couple of small books that are

1553
01:40:05,976 --> 01:40:09,446
put off to the side, and what looks like a small
wooden box.

1554
01:40:09,446 --> 01:40:12,211
LIAM: Is the box trapped?

1555
01:40:12,211 --> 01:40:15,261
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

1556
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:20,483
LIAM: That is a 22.

1557
01:40:20,483 --> 01:40:23,344
MATT: Box does not appear trapped, from what you
can tell.

1558
01:40:23,344 --> 01:40:25,657
LIAM: Nah, fuck it.

1559
01:40:25,657 --> 01:40:27,751
TALIESIN: Put it in the Bag of Holding.

1560
01:40:27,751 --> 01:40:29,061
LIAM: I don't.

1561
01:40:29,061 --> 01:40:30,553
MATT: Okay, continue walking?

1562
01:40:30,553 --> 01:40:32,227
LIAM: Mm-hm. Looking for traps.

1563
01:40:32,227 --> 01:40:38,997
MATT: Okay. As you continue, keeping an eye out in
front of you, the next shelf you come across looks

1564
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:44,048
to have some sort of a mummified racoon-type
creature that is propped up.

1565
01:40:44,048 --> 01:40:47,951
(laughter)

1566
01:40:47,951 --> 01:40:54,262
MATT: Not taxidermied, by any means. It just looks
like it dried out in a sort of standing position,

1567
01:40:54,262 --> 01:40:56,412
or at least is leaning against the wall of the
platform.

1568
01:40:56,412 --> 01:41:00,024
MARISHA: Oh, like some weird Pompeii shit? Like he
died that way?

1569
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:01,928
MATT: Kind of. Literally just shriveled.

1570
01:41:01,928 --> 01:41:06,118
LAURA: Grog, would you be able to use a flying
carpet in battle to get up to a dragon?

1571
01:41:06,118 --> 01:41:08,655
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

1572
01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:11,637
LAURA: It could be useful.

1573
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:14,244
MATT: Kerrek, do you have something you wanted to
say?

1574
01:41:14,244 --> 01:41:19,229
PATRICK: Yeah, I'm just gonna-- blind as a bat as
I am, I'm gonna use Divine Sense to see if I can

1575
01:41:19,229 --> 01:41:27,648
sense any undead, corrupt, fiend, it's kind of a
long list, but I do know corrupt

1576
01:41:27,648 --> 01:41:29,671
was mentioned in there.

1577
01:41:29,671 --> 01:41:38,645
TALIESIN: Also, Vax, what were the titles of those
books? Earpiece, listening to your vague

1578
01:41:38,645 --> 01:41:40,298
description of things.

1579
01:41:40,298 --> 01:41:50,792
LIAM: Thank you for retconning that. Yeah, we'll
ask him. Yeah, but I would've read them if I

1580
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:52,897
could've. I'm not Grog.

1581
01:41:52,897 --> 01:41:56,395
TALIESIN: Grog would've read them, even if he just
made up words.

1582
01:41:56,395 --> 01:42:04,927
MATT: You do sense that there is some sort of an
undead presence in your vicinity, Kerr, though you

1583
01:42:04,927 --> 01:42:11,378
do not quite know what its nature is or its
direction. There is something undead near you.

1584
01:42:11,378 --> 01:42:15,987
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. She didn't bring Thordak back,
did she? We're gonna have to

1585
01:42:15,987 --> 01:42:17,197
fight an undead dragon.

1586
01:42:17,197 --> 01:42:26,396
PATRICK: Do I get a sense of-- is it just, yes, it
is present, I don't get any sense of direction or

1587
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:32,395
intensity? I'm assuming this isn't my first rodeo.
Everybody bumps into skeletons

1588
01:42:32,395 --> 01:42:33,947
early in their career.

1589
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:44,099
MATT: Correct. I would say it does not appear to
be any extreme-- yeah, it does not appear to be an

1590
01:42:44,099 --> 01:42:49,562
extremely powerful undead presence. You can't tell
size or direction, by any means, but it's not like

1591
01:42:49,562 --> 01:42:56,535
all of a sudden there's a lich ahead of you or
some massive arrival of Orcus. You just sense

1592
01:42:56,535 --> 01:42:59,282
something around you that is an undead energy.

1593
01:42:59,282 --> 01:43:01,599
LAURA: Around us? Like how close around us, can he
sense that?

1594
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:05,944
LIAM: I mean, this could be crypt shit on the
sides. I'm gonna focus a

1595
01:43:05,944 --> 01:43:07,448
little more on the ground.

1596
01:43:07,448 --> 01:43:09,373
MATT: Okay, do you guys all continue moving
forward?

1597
01:43:09,373 --> 01:43:11,730
TALIESIN: I did ask about the books, the titles of
the books.

1598
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:13,631
LIAM: Yes, he asked me through the earpiece what
the books said.

1599
01:43:13,631 --> 01:43:15,477
Could I read them when I saw them?

1600
01:43:15,477 --> 01:43:17,227
MATT: What languages do you know?

1601
01:43:17,227 --> 01:43:19,136
LIAM: Common, Elvish, and Abyssal?

1602
01:43:19,136 --> 01:43:21,167
MATT: You do not know the title of the books.

1603
01:43:21,167 --> 01:43:29,068
LIAM: Tighter Buns in 30 Days is the only title I
saw. Looking for traps.

1604
01:43:29,068 --> 01:43:34,161
MATT: All right. Roll another investigation
check.

1605
01:43:34,161 --> 01:43:37,264
LIAM: 25.

1606
01:43:37,264 --> 01:43:48,233
MATT: 25, okay. You continue to push forward.
There is no trap set. You do look ahead and see

1607
01:43:48,233 --> 01:43:54,697
what appears to be the pathway is now showing
stonework at times, almost like there are slabs,

1608
01:43:54,697 --> 01:44:02,216
elements of a tunnel that was once better
constructed than what exists, but is either eroded

1609
01:44:02,216 --> 01:44:06,478
away or elements of wall collapse have covered
what was once a

1610
01:44:06,478 --> 01:44:09,210
very, very ancient form of architecture.

1611
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:14,207
LIAM: As a precaution, I'm going to, as much as I
can, stay to the stuff that looks natural or

1612
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:18,336
fucked-up and not civilized.

1613
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:27,563
PATRICK: Hold on, first, I'm sorry. I just found
my specific description. It does say I sense type

1614
01:44:27,563 --> 01:44:29,307
and location.

1615
01:44:29,307 --> 01:44:31,355
MATT: It does say that, I totally missed that.

1616
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:33,434
PATRICK: So long as it's not behind total cover.

1617
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:42,250
MATT: Got you. Okay. Then you sense there is
something. You know it's from one of the wall

1618
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:47,296
areas, but you cannot see, and your one single bit
of light source is ahead of you in the tunnel. But

1619
01:44:47,296 --> 01:44:52,485
you do sense, at one point as you're walking, it
is to the left of you.

1620
01:44:52,485 --> 01:45:00,099
PATRICK: Okay. I say, there is an unclean thing
here.

1621
01:45:00,099 --> 01:45:03,589
TRAVIS: Well, fuck, I'm sorry, it's just not a
priority for me, all right?

1622
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:07,382
(laughter)

1623
01:45:07,382 --> 01:45:10,616
TRAVIS: I mean, I put my arm down off his
shoulder, I'll grant him at least that.

1624
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:18,768
PATRICK: It's not you, Grog, there's some undead
thing here, and I say, it's off to the left.

1625
01:45:18,768 --> 01:45:20,757
To my left.

1626
01:45:20,757 --> 01:45:23,305
TALIESIN: The left hand of the tunnel.

1627
01:45:23,305 --> 01:45:25,418
PATRICK: But I don't know what's around here.

1628
01:45:25,418 --> 01:45:31,168
LAURA: Can we see anything on the walls that looks
like a door or anything?

1629
01:45:31,168 --> 01:45:35,025
MATT: Are you stopping? 'Cause you two are moving
ahead of everyone else, so you guys are probably a

1630
01:45:35,025 --> 01:45:37,567
good 15, 20 feet ahead. You want to move back with
them?

1631
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:38,748
LAURA: No, no.

1632
01:45:38,748 --> 01:45:42,798
TRAVIS: Can I look to the left, just off him
saying that, because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind I

1633
01:45:42,798 --> 01:45:44,515
have Darkvision?

1634
01:45:44,515 --> 01:45:49,380
MATT: You do. You glance off to the left. You can
see upon that shelf unit there, there are the two

1635
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:52,656
candles and the singular skull set on the shelf.

1636
01:45:52,656 --> 01:46:00,859
TRAVIS: I start to slowly make my way over to the
skull.

1637
01:46:00,859 --> 01:46:02,398
MATT: Okay.

1638
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:03,724
LIAM: Gods damn it.

1639
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:06,999
MATT: Kerrek, you feel Grog slowly step in the
direction that you pointed out to him.

1640
01:46:06,999 --> 01:46:08,719
TRAVIS: Is this the direction?

1641
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,973
PATRICK: Yes.

1642
01:46:10,973 --> 01:46:12,856
TRAVIS: Are we getting warmer?

1643
01:46:12,856 --> 01:46:22,718
PATRICK: Yes, it's over there. I'm not bringing my
hammer out, but my hammer's ready.

1644
01:46:22,718 --> 01:46:24,991
TRAVIS: What does the skull look like?

1645
01:46:24,991 --> 01:46:27,084
MATT: It looks like a human skull.

1646
01:46:27,084 --> 01:46:30,106
TRAVIS: Anything shiny about it, or jewelled?

1647
01:46:30,106 --> 01:46:35,565
MATT: No, it looks kind of dust-covered. You can
see what looks to be-- the bone itself appears to

1648
01:46:35,565 --> 01:46:41,103
have a hint of blackened soot, or some sort of a
darker color to it,

1649
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:42,997
like it's been slightly singed.

1650
01:46:42,997 --> 01:46:44,579
TRAVIS: Candles look like candles?

1651
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:46,556
MATT: Candles look like mostly melted candles.

1652
01:46:46,556 --> 01:46:51,816
TRAVIS: Kerr, I hate to rain on your parade, but I
only see two candles and a human skull up here.

1653
01:46:51,816 --> 01:47:02,030
PATRICK: Partial undead thing... do I know, again,
obviously nothing is trying to eat our faces off

1654
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:13,193
here, but can you turn an undead thing into just
like a watcher or a trap or a spy or a trigger?

1655
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:17,206
MATT: Make an intelligence check, or make a
religion check. Make a religion check.

1656
01:47:17,206 --> 01:47:27,554
LAURA: Oh, it could be watching through the skull.
You're brilliant, Kerr! Fuck.

1657
01:47:27,554 --> 01:47:30,869
PATRICK: You know, that's about a 12.

1658
01:47:30,869 --> 01:47:31,948
MATT: Okay.

1659
01:47:31,948 --> 01:47:33,515
PATRICK: Not my best.

1660
01:47:33,515 --> 01:47:42,546
MATT: Best that you can understand is, undead
magic can raise dead, it can control dead. You

1661
01:47:42,546 --> 01:47:54,027
have heard stories of undead or the use of them
being more situational, as opposed to just roaming

1662
01:47:54,027 --> 01:47:58,488
as zombies, but that's as much as you can call off
the top of your head. It's been a while since

1663
01:47:58,488 --> 01:48:01,812
you've been adventuring, so the specific stories
are a little too foggy.

1664
01:48:01,812 --> 01:48:04,522
TALIESIN: Yeah, it could be a security camera.

1665
01:48:04,522 --> 01:48:08,509
PATRICK: Actually, I say, if there's-- give me the
skull. And I'm just

1666
01:48:08,509 --> 01:48:10,518
reaching out blindly in his direction.

1667
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:12,838
TRAVIS: All right. I grab the skull and hand it to
Kerr.

1668
01:48:12,838 --> 01:48:14,180
MATT: Okay.

1669
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:19,443
PATRICK: And then I'll use Divine Sense again. Is
it this?

1670
01:48:19,443 --> 01:48:29,305
MATT: It is, the skull is the source of the undead
energy. It is not currently moving or reacting or

1671
01:48:29,305 --> 01:48:36,539
having any sort of reaction to being held by you.

1672
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:39,829
PATRICK: I say, anybody mind if I wreck this
thing?

1673
01:48:39,829 --> 01:48:44,590
TRAVIS: No, I do not mind at all, thank god
there's someone else in this world

1674
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,290
with my sort of thinking.

1675
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:49,087
LIAM: What are you doing back there?

1676
01:48:49,087 --> 01:48:58,442
TRAVIS: Hold on. I grab my earring, and I say,
Kerr found a human skull that has some undead

1677
01:48:58,442 --> 01:49:00,876
vibes vibrating out of it.

1678
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:02,192
LAURA: Okay.

1679
01:49:02,192 --> 01:49:07,558
TRAVIS: But it's not doing anything. Do you mind
if we destroy it?

1680
01:49:07,558 --> 01:49:09,424
LIAM: He's already holding it?

1681
01:49:09,424 --> 01:49:10,441
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1682
01:49:10,441 --> 01:49:15,823
LIAM: Well, I mean, if anything was gonna happen,
we're probably fucked already, so I don't know.

1683
01:49:15,823 --> 01:49:17,427
TALIESIN: Actually, where's Kima?

1684
01:49:17,427 --> 01:49:22,446
MATT: That's a good point. What is your guys'
marching order, by the way? I know the twins are

1685
01:49:22,446 --> 01:49:23,846
in the front.

1686
01:49:23,846 --> 01:49:30,267
TALIESIN: Then I think it's you and Kerr, and then
me and--

1687
01:49:30,267 --> 01:49:36,950
MATT: Grog and Kerr, Keyleth and Percy--

1688
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:40,622
TALIESIN: Ash and Scanlan.

1689
01:49:40,622 --> 01:49:49,751
MATT: Ash and Scanlan after that. And then we
have-- do you have Trinket out of the necklace,

1690
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:56,421
right? Then probably Kima and Allura back with
Trinket in the back. So they're kind of holding up

1691
01:49:56,421 --> 01:49:58,516
the rear and keeping an eye out behind as they
go.

1692
01:49:58,516 --> 01:50:00,220
TALIESIN: I think destroying it will trigger it.

1693
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:04,992
LIAM: I'm kind of for leaving things alone as we
go through here, Percival.

1694
01:50:04,992 --> 01:50:07,653
TRAVIS: I mean, we can leave it alone.

1695
01:50:07,653 --> 01:50:12,203
LAURA: I could do Sacred Flame on it, and it would
do radiant damage to it.

1696
01:50:12,203 --> 01:50:17,835
MARISHA: What if we turn and just face the skull
so it's looking into the corner.

1697
01:50:17,835 --> 01:50:19,609
LAURA: Sure.

1698
01:50:19,609 --> 01:50:21,609
MARISHA: So it's not looking at us.

1699
01:50:21,609 --> 01:50:25,629
LIAM: I think dicking with it in the first place
might have already ruined us, but yeah, let's just

1700
01:50:25,629 --> 01:50:27,282
set it down, turn it around.

1701
01:50:27,282 --> 01:50:32,332
TRAVIS: Hey, Kerr, they're worried we're gonna
kill ourselves. Can you just put it back, but face

1702
01:50:32,332 --> 01:50:34,343
it towards the wall like it's in time out?

1703
01:50:34,343 --> 01:50:40,252
PATRICK: Sure. If I've got a spare sack, I'll
stuff it in the sack and

1704
01:50:40,252 --> 01:50:41,659
point it towards the wall.

1705
01:50:41,659 --> 01:50:48,300
MATT: Okay. So you pull out the extra, kind of a
heavy burlap sack, you throw the skull in there,

1706
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,395
tie it taut, and set it back up on the shelf,
facing away from where you're standing.

1707
01:50:51,395 --> 01:50:53,223
TALIESIN: Do not underestimate the power of
burlap.

1708
01:50:53,223 --> 01:50:57,740
LAURA: We should've come down in the tunnel
wearing pantyhose on our heads so Raishan wouldn't

1709
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:59,015
have known.

1710
01:50:59,015 --> 01:51:00,837
TALIESIN: Just thought it was a college prank?

1711
01:51:00,837 --> 01:51:04,127
MARISHA: Oh man, we should totally invest in those
little pantyhose eggs.

1712
01:51:04,127 --> 01:51:07,400
LIAM: Delta lambda again, sneaking in, aw.

1713
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,230
MATT: Every time!

1714
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:12,039
LIAM: I don't know enough about that to say that
correctly, either.

1715
01:51:12,039 --> 01:51:18,181
MATT: Continuing onward, into the next length of
the tunnel, about another 50 feet or so, there

1716
01:51:18,181 --> 01:51:27,655
is-- the room opens up, and you can see that
stonework eventually takes the entire floor, and

1717
01:51:27,655 --> 01:51:34,964
the chamber opens up into what looks to be almost
like a hexagonal-shaped chamber that ends at a

1718
01:51:34,964 --> 01:51:42,000
large iron door. It fills the entirety of the
chamber, and it seals off any progression from

1719
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,828
that point. Make a perception check.

1720
01:51:44,828 --> 01:51:47,144
TRAVIS: Vex-agonal shaped.

1721
01:51:47,144 --> 01:51:50,535
LAURA: Vex-agonal? Should I make a perception
check, too, since I'm near it?

1722
01:51:50,535 --> 01:51:51,914
MATT: Sure.

1723
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:53,393
LIAM: 22.

1724
01:51:53,393 --> 01:51:57,036
LAURA: Oh god, that was almost a one. But it's
not, it was a 15.

1725
01:51:57,036 --> 01:52:06,528
MATT: Okay. So 15 total? Okay. As you glance, you
can see at the center of this chamber there looks

1726
01:52:06,528 --> 01:52:18,101
to be-- let's see here. Okay, yeah. There stands a
pillar of dark green marble, about ten feet, 15

1727
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:24,247
feet away from where the iron door is, and what
looks to be a roughly forged bowl of iron that is

1728
01:52:24,247 --> 01:52:29,026
imperfect and is bolted to the top of this
pillar.

1729
01:52:29,026 --> 01:52:32,484
LIAM: On the top or out the side of the top?

1730
01:52:32,484 --> 01:52:39,465
MATT: Resting on top of it, and it's about maybe
five, six feet up, and there is a platform that

1731
01:52:39,465 --> 01:52:44,234
leads up to it. So maybe if you were standing on
the little dais around it, it'd be about

1732
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:45,929
chest-height to you.

1733
01:52:45,929 --> 01:52:47,953
LIAM: How tall is this chamber?

1734
01:52:47,953 --> 01:52:56,486
MATT: The chamber's whole height would be about 25
feet. You also see, off to the right, what appears

1735
01:52:56,486 --> 01:53:03,954
to be another shelf that contains a very, very
large leather-bound tome and what looks to be a

1736
01:53:03,954 --> 01:53:10,699
cold iron brazier that is unburnt but has a bunch
of dried tinder in it.

1737
01:53:10,699 --> 01:53:14,798
LAURA: Oh, god.

1738
01:53:14,798 --> 01:53:16,429
LIAM: Oh, come here, come here.

1739
01:53:16,429 --> 01:53:17,703
LAURA: What?

1740
01:53:17,703 --> 01:53:22,823
LIAM: There's some shit, there's some ingredients
in that, ready to go.

1741
01:53:22,823 --> 01:53:25,320
LAURA: There's ingredients?

1742
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:29,187
LIAM: Yeah, there's something in that brazier over
there that she hasn't burned yet.

1743
01:53:29,187 --> 01:53:33,343
TALIESIN: Can I get a little light in here, just
for a second?

1744
01:53:33,343 --> 01:53:34,641
LIAM: I'm holding.

1745
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:40,463
MATT: You have a tiny bit of candlelight. You can
see about ten, 15 feet around Vax.

1746
01:53:40,463 --> 01:53:44,463
TALIESIN: Okay, so I can't see the mechanism on
the door.

1747
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:47,581
MATT: You do not even know there's a door there.

1748
01:53:47,581 --> 01:53:50,512
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair. For the best, it
would just scare me.

1749
01:53:50,512 --> 01:53:52,678
LAURA: I mean, would it be helpful if everyone
could see?

1750
01:53:52,678 --> 01:53:55,029
TALIESIN: Take a look around.

1751
01:53:55,029 --> 01:54:01,519
MARISHA: No one else is in this room, yeah? Can
the half-elves with Darkvision do a little--

1752
01:54:01,519 --> 01:54:03,467
MATT: Make perception checks.

1753
01:54:03,467 --> 01:54:08,368
LIAM: I'll do that, and I'm also going to do
Divine Sense here.

1754
01:54:08,368 --> 01:54:14,851
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, thanks, Gil!
That's not bad! Perception, right? 26.

1755
01:54:14,851 --> 01:54:16,499
TRAVIS: 16.

1756
01:54:16,499 --> 01:54:17,651
LIAM: 22.

1757
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:21,705
MATT: There does not appear to be anybody else in
this chamber with you, and from your Divine Sense,

1758
01:54:21,705 --> 01:54:26,885
you do not sense any undead within 60 feet of you
right now.

1759
01:54:26,885 --> 01:54:28,826
LIAM: There's no undead dragons walking around.

1760
01:54:28,826 --> 01:54:31,131
TRAVIS: Can I look for invisible dragons? No, I'm
kidding.

1761
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:33,929
TALIESIN: You see seven.

1762
01:54:33,929 --> 01:54:37,042
LAURA: So, Light? Should we light it up?

1763
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:42,453
MATT: He doesn't sense any undead within 60 feet,
that's the range of it.

1764
01:54:42,453 --> 01:54:47,553
LIAM: Right. How far from the gate to the far side
of the room, is the first question.

1765
01:54:47,553 --> 01:54:50,749
MATT: The doorway, you mean?

1766
01:54:50,749 --> 01:54:54,947
LIAM: I'm at a gate that blocks us from going in,
is that correct?

1767
01:54:54,947 --> 01:54:58,084
MATT: No, you're entering this chamber, then on
the opposite side of the room there is a larger

1768
01:54:58,084 --> 01:55:02,760
door that prevents you from progressing beyond the
doorway. In between you and that door, there is

1769
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:08,574
that raised platform, the pillar, and the iron
bowl, and then to the right and against the wall,

1770
01:55:08,574 --> 01:55:13,877
there is the brazier and the shelf with the
singular tome.

1771
01:55:13,877 --> 01:55:21,007
LAURA: Does it look like-- when we entered the
chamber, does it look like a door would come down

1772
01:55:21,007 --> 01:55:23,460
or something when it opened up into the chamber?

1773
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:27,696
LIAM: Right, is there a gap, like a crack that
something could slide down out of right above

1774
01:55:27,696 --> 01:55:29,151
where we are?

1775
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:34,632
MATT: Glancing up, based on your perception rolls,
you don't see anything that would dictate any sort

1776
01:55:34,632 --> 01:55:36,866
of exit or entranceway from the ceiling.

1777
01:55:36,866 --> 01:55:41,533
LIAM: And in addition to everything we see, do we
see levers, do we see panels, do we see anything

1778
01:55:41,533 --> 01:55:43,313
on the walls in this room?

1779
01:55:43,313 --> 01:55:51,039
MATT: No, there's standard stone, old stone
masonry. You can see chunks that have broken off

1780
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:56,615
and just fallen over the years, there's a couple
small cave-in areas where it looks like rocks have

1781
01:55:56,615 --> 01:56:03,822
just tumbled in as the general shifting of the
island has caused some elements to fall loose and

1782
01:56:03,822 --> 01:56:05,101
tumble in.

1783
01:56:05,101 --> 01:56:07,727
MARISHA: Keyleth is gonna go ahead and light up
her fire hands.

1784
01:56:07,727 --> 01:56:16,017
MATT: Okay. That gives a bigger radius. Comparable
torchlight to Keyleth, and now Kerrek and

1785
01:56:16,017 --> 01:56:22,952
Percival, you guys can both have a much better
view of the room. You can see now this iron bowl

1786
01:56:22,952 --> 01:56:28,971
on top of this pillar in the center. You can just
make out the large iron wall or door on the

1787
01:56:28,971 --> 01:56:33,200
opposite side, and a little bit of the brazier and
the tome.

1788
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:41,236
TALIESIN: I've built a fire-lock mechanism for a
door before. Would I recognize this as being a set

1789
01:56:41,236 --> 01:56:45,368
a fire in the bowl and that might open the door?

1790
01:56:45,368 --> 01:56:47,024
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1791
01:56:47,024 --> 01:56:49,904
TALIESIN: I built one for the Raven Queen temple.

1792
01:56:49,904 --> 01:56:51,436
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go.

1793
01:56:51,436 --> 01:56:57,490
TALIESIN: Intelligence check? That's, with my new
intelligence level, that's a 19.

1794
01:56:57,490 --> 01:57:03,636
MATT: 19. Best you can glance here, I mean, it's
possible, but this--

1795
01:57:03,636 --> 01:57:05,803
TALIESIN: It's magic.

1796
01:57:05,803 --> 01:57:10,181
MATT: You don't know. The room itself is ancient,
and the construction, there is nothing that

1797
01:57:10,181 --> 01:57:12,323
appears to be mechanically attached.

1798
01:57:12,323 --> 01:57:14,362
TALIESIN: So if it did, it would be magical. If
that was--

1799
01:57:14,362 --> 01:57:22,853
MATT: Yeah, there's no chain, pulley system
visible at all. Where the door hits the seam of

1800
01:57:22,853 --> 01:57:25,724
the room, it looks very smooth.

1801
01:57:25,724 --> 01:57:31,162
LAURA: Can I go look in the bowl, the bowl in the
middle of the room, and just look and see if

1802
01:57:31,162 --> 01:57:32,398
there's a residue of anything in it?

1803
01:57:32,398 --> 01:57:36,000
MATT: Sure, you can make an investigation check.

1804
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,919
PATRICK: Can I just say that when the lights came
up, Kerr kind of, he'd been leaning into Grog

1805
01:57:41,919 --> 01:57:49,277
maybe more than was entirely appropriate. So he
kind of stood up a little better on his own to get

1806
01:57:49,277 --> 01:57:51,940
out of it.

1807
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,764
MATT: Right. (clears throat)

1808
01:57:53,764 --> 01:57:55,921
LIAM: Luckily, no one saw you, because of that
robe.

1809
01:57:55,921 --> 01:57:57,509
LAURA: 26.

1810
01:57:57,509 --> 01:58:06,195
MATT: As you look down into the bowl, you can make
out what looks to be a very, very faint long-dried

1811
01:58:06,195 --> 01:58:10,703
residue just at the very, very bottom of it. Some
sort of a liquid that was once in there that has

1812
01:58:10,703 --> 01:58:16,458
since dried up entirely and left this very, very
faint, just a slight shift in texture other than

1813
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:17,912
the hammered iron.

1814
01:58:17,912 --> 01:58:20,685
LAURA: No color change or anything on it?

1815
01:58:20,685 --> 01:58:24,008
MATT: Not that you can really tell, no. You're
just looking into this dark bowl with a little bit

1816
01:58:24,008 --> 01:58:25,162
of light source.

1817
01:58:25,162 --> 01:58:26,637
LAURA: Well, I don't actually touch it.

1818
01:58:26,637 --> 01:58:31,708
TALIESIN: Do you have something sharp to just
scrape some off?

1819
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:35,041
LIAM: While she's doing that, I'm just going to
quietly extend my wings now.

1820
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:37,830
MATT: Your wings.

1821
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:41,133
LAURA: Oh yeah, I get out a lockpick and scrape it
to see if I can--

1822
01:58:41,133 --> 01:58:42,746
PATRICK: Holy shit!

1823
01:58:42,746 --> 01:58:44,972
(laughter)

1824
01:58:44,972 --> 01:58:46,821
LIAM: They're pretty cool, aren't they.

1825
01:58:46,821 --> 01:58:48,624
LAURA: They take up a lot of room, though, so.

1826
01:58:48,624 --> 01:58:51,675
LIAM: No, they don't. They go out and they slam
back into my back.

1827
01:58:51,675 --> 01:58:54,476
MATT: Yeah, Kerrek, as they're having this
conversation, you're looking, watching as this

1828
01:58:54,476 --> 01:59:00,361
small half-elf rogue that you've had a few
encounters with suddenly just sends this pair of

1829
01:59:00,361 --> 01:59:06,692
large jet-black raven-like wings that fire from
his shoulderblades and slowly fold behind him.

1830
01:59:06,692 --> 01:59:09,042
TALIESIN: They don't work. He just does that to be
an asshole.

1831
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:14,224
MARISHA: It's all a cosplay prop. That's all it
is.

1832
01:59:14,224 --> 01:59:18,682
PATRICK: Strikes a bit of a figure, though,
doesn't he?

1833
01:59:18,682 --> 01:59:20,023
TALIESIN: No, it's very attractive.

1834
01:59:20,023 --> 01:59:23,879
LIAM: I heard Percival say that.

1835
01:59:23,879 --> 01:59:26,920
LAURA: Scratch-scratch, scrape-scrape.

1836
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,176
MATT: You're scraping the--

1837
01:59:28,176 --> 01:59:30,112
LAURA: Yeah, just to see what the residue is.

1838
01:59:30,112 --> 01:59:35,027
MATT: Okay, it scrapes up, it creates a small,
almost like a dried powder-type substance.

1839
01:59:35,027 --> 01:59:37,699
LAURA: What color is it?

1840
01:59:37,699 --> 01:59:39,377
MATT: It's like a dark burgundy.

1841
01:59:39,377 --> 01:59:41,066
LAURA: This is fucking blood.

1842
01:59:41,066 --> 01:59:42,475
TALIESIN: Can I taste it?

1843
01:59:42,475 --> 01:59:45,283
MATT: Yeah, taste it, has kind of an iron-like
taste.

1844
01:59:45,283 --> 01:59:47,512
MARISHA: Oh, it's so blood. Oh, you're so right.

1845
01:59:47,512 --> 01:59:50,165
LAURA: Maybe we should just bleed into this bowl
and the door will open.

1846
01:59:50,165 --> 01:59:51,495
TALIESIN: Tempting.

1847
01:59:51,495 --> 01:59:52,984
TRAVIS: I can do that.

1848
01:59:52,984 --> 01:59:54,194
LAURA: Necromancy?

1849
01:59:54,194 --> 01:59:57,354
MARISHA: I think that's the word, yeah.

1850
01:59:57,354 --> 02:00:02,441
TALIESIN: Do we recognize the architecture of the
door, and I also want to take a look at that book.

1851
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:06,221
What is the book's language, what does it look
like? I'm not picking it up yet, I'm just looking

1852
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:07,892
at it on the shelf.

1853
02:00:07,892 --> 02:00:13,679
MATT: The leather tome which is currently leaning
up against it has no text on the cover and no text

1854
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,613
on the spine, but it is big. It's about that big.
So it's like a tome.

1855
02:00:17,613 --> 02:00:19,361
TRAVIS: Is it made of skin?

1856
02:00:19,361 --> 02:00:22,714
MATT: Grog, do you want to go over and check it
out?

1857
02:00:22,714 --> 02:00:24,038
TRAVIS: Yes.

1858
02:00:24,038 --> 02:00:29,400
MATT: Okay. It appears to be a thick leather. It's
hard to tell in this light if it was made from

1859
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:33,033
tanned hide or tanned flesh, but it is old.

1860
02:00:33,033 --> 02:00:38,275
LIAM: As we're watching Grog, I just lean over and
say, you know, you are criticizing the size of my

1861
02:00:38,275 --> 02:00:43,938
wings, you are walking around with a Persian rug,
a broom, and a longbow strapped to your back.

1862
02:00:43,938 --> 02:00:46,918
LAURA: I tried to give this rug to someone else,
but Grog didn't want to take it.

1863
02:00:46,918 --> 02:00:54,041
MARISHA: And then I come up and I say, can I pet
your wings? I've never pet them before.

1864
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:59,633
LAURA: There's things going on in this room.

1865
02:00:59,633 --> 02:01:06,260
MATT: You can hear this heavy sigh from Allura
behind you, she's like, (sighs). "I'm just, this

1866
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:08,902
"is my first time actually adventuring with you."

1867
02:01:08,902 --> 02:01:13,057
MARISHA: This is our method.

1868
02:01:13,057 --> 02:01:16,277
TALIESIN: We're going to see if we put the PDA in
the bowl, see if that'll--

1869
02:01:16,277 --> 02:01:19,797
MATT: "Oh, don't get me wrong, it just reminds me
of my early days as an adventurer, and I forgot

1870
02:01:19,797 --> 02:01:21,845
"just how ridiculous we were, so."

1871
02:01:21,845 --> 02:01:24,304
TRAVIS: Is there still tinder under the--

1872
02:01:24,304 --> 02:01:31,041
MATT: Yeah, there's the iron brazier and there's a
lot of dried-- inside there, yeah.

1873
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:35,185
TALIESIN: Well, we do have samples of blood, in
theory, in the Bag of Holding.

1874
02:01:35,185 --> 02:01:39,959
LAURA: We've got dragon blood. I'm gonna get out a
vial of dragon blood.

1875
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:41,604
(feedback sound)

1876
02:01:41,604 --> 02:01:43,042
LIAM: Oh, jeez.

1877
02:01:43,042 --> 02:01:44,292
TALIESIN: You've caused a feedback loop.

1878
02:01:44,292 --> 02:01:45,624
LIAM: She's coming!

1879
02:01:45,624 --> 02:01:47,551
MARISHA: We are Spinal Tap!

1880
02:01:47,551 --> 02:01:49,709
LAURA: What is it?

1881
02:01:49,709 --> 02:01:51,243
MATT: I don't know.

1882
02:01:51,243 --> 02:01:53,375
LAURA: I put the dragon blood away.

1883
02:01:53,375 --> 02:01:56,970
LIAM: Are there any holes in the ceiling I can see
like there were in the last cave?

1884
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,653
MARISHA: I have this ringing in my ear.

1885
02:01:58,653 --> 02:02:02,270
MATT: There do not appear to be holes in the
ceiling, no.

1886
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:07,373
LAURA: What should I do? Wait, I've also got other
kinds of blood, let me see what kinds of blood

1887
02:02:07,373 --> 02:02:08,288
I've got.

1888
02:02:08,288 --> 02:02:09,814
TALIESIN: Is the book trapped?

1889
02:02:09,814 --> 02:02:17,391
LIAM: 24.

1890
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:23,300
MATT: 24? Looking at the book, are you taking it
off the shelf or are you--

1891
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,190
LIAM: No, I'm looking at it, man.

1892
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:29,022
MATT: Looking at it. It looks like it is just
resting against the wall. The shelf unit is not

1893
02:02:29,022 --> 02:02:33,059
trapped, the book itself does not appear to have
any sort of connection to the wall, you can see

1894
02:02:33,059 --> 02:02:38,686
the pages themselves are weathered, old, stained,
but intact.

1895
02:02:38,686 --> 02:02:42,536
LIAM: Is anyone near me?

1896
02:02:42,536 --> 02:02:46,672
MATT: Currently, Percival's a step or two behind
you.

1897
02:02:46,672 --> 02:02:48,459
TALIESIN: I'm holding onto the wing.

1898
02:02:48,459 --> 02:02:58,294
LIAM: I push back slowly with my wings. Just get
15, 20 behind me. I'm gonna bring it to you. I'm

1899
02:02:58,294 --> 02:03:01,679
gonna try to take this fucking book off, okay? If
I'm going to go down, I don't want you to go down

1900
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:03,351
as well, all right?

1901
02:03:03,351 --> 02:03:05,488
TRAVIS: Are you about to die right now?

1902
02:03:05,488 --> 02:03:07,831
MARISHA: Don't, Ve-- Vax.

1903
02:03:07,831 --> 02:03:12,097
(laughter)

1904
02:03:12,097 --> 02:03:17,552
MARISHA: I love you! I know your name on my good
days.

1905
02:03:17,552 --> 02:03:20,250
TRAVIS: (chanting) Grab it, grab it, grab it.

1906
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:29,439
LIAM: I get back about ten feet and I take my wing
and I scootch it--

1907
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:31,126
LAURA: Oh wait, you know what?

1908
02:03:31,126 --> 02:03:36,905
MATT: As you're saying this, the book (impact) and
hits the ground. It scatters open.

1909
02:03:36,905 --> 02:03:42,808
LIAM: Oh, it's open? Percival, come here. And I
light it up, just to look

1910
02:03:42,808 --> 02:03:44,335
at the pages that are there.

1911
02:03:44,335 --> 02:03:49,776
MATT: So you take the dagger and you place it over
there. You don't recognize the text. And you try

1912
02:03:49,776 --> 02:03:53,106
and focus on it, too, and you don't recognize it,
either. It's like the more you look at the text,

1913
02:03:53,106 --> 02:03:59,478
the text gets smaller and smaller and smaller
until it's microscopic. It just looks like a mess

1914
02:03:59,478 --> 02:04:03,896
of symbols and details. It's weird, it's almost
like as you get closer, the perspective keeps

1915
02:04:03,896 --> 02:04:07,863
shifting away from you, to where you cannot
actually make out or read the text in the book.

1916
02:04:07,863 --> 02:04:09,173
TRAVIS: How's it feel?

1917
02:04:09,173 --> 02:04:16,104
TALIESIN: I'm gonna flip gently, with a gloved
hand, flip through a couple pages just to see if

1918
02:04:16,104 --> 02:04:17,932
it's text, text, text, or if there's any--

1919
02:04:17,932 --> 02:04:23,075
MATT: As of right now, it looks like there's just
text. As you go through, every page seems to have

1920
02:04:23,075 --> 02:04:28,219
the same sort of reaction, where as your eyes try
and focus in the low light, the text just gets

1921
02:04:28,219 --> 02:04:30,510
smaller and smaller and just avoid comprehension.

1922
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:33,840
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip to the front really
quickly and see if there's a title.

1923
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,856
MATT: There is a title, and as you look at it, the
title itself seems to be blurred and obscured and

1924
02:04:38,856 --> 02:04:42,785
begins to shrink as well. It's like trying to put
on a pair of reading glasses that won't focus.

1925
02:04:42,785 --> 02:04:44,399
TALIESIN: I know that feeling.

1926
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:45,953
LIAM: Allura, will you have a look at this?

1927
02:04:45,953 --> 02:04:47,668
MATT: She comes over. Kerr, what are you doing?

1928
02:04:47,668 --> 02:04:57,422
PATRICK: I'll actually bring out my hammer and,
assuming that I can get close to the book as well,

1929
02:04:57,422 --> 02:05:00,140
it does the same thing for me?

1930
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:04,912
MATT: As you get close and look, yes, the same
thing, your vision doesn't seem to focus on the

1931
02:05:04,912 --> 02:05:06,768
text, the pages seem to just hide from--

1932
02:05:06,768 --> 02:05:09,478
PATRICK: I was going to say, are we okay with more
light?

1933
02:05:09,478 --> 02:05:12,256
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1934
02:05:12,256 --> 02:05:17,937
PATRICK: Kind of looking around. Okay. Then I'll
effectively, I'll activate the hammer.

1935
02:05:17,937 --> 02:05:21,947
MATT: Okay. As he pulls his warhammer in front of
him, you watch as the head of it,

1936
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:24,425
the spike in the back--

1937
02:05:24,425 --> 02:05:32,629
PATRICK: There is no head, it's just kind of a bar
of iron that he has until he holds it up, and then

1938
02:05:32,629 --> 02:05:39,928
the head of it comes into being as an artifact of
radiant light.

1939
02:05:39,928 --> 02:05:41,476
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool!

1940
02:05:41,476 --> 02:05:48,161
MATT: So what would've been the back of the
hammer, the front of it is, like you said, missing

1941
02:05:48,161 --> 02:05:55,069
entirely, and it just blazes forth with radiant
energy, like a giant, glowing metallic

1942
02:05:55,069 --> 02:05:56,669
end of a weapon.

1943
02:05:56,669 --> 02:06:00,505
PATRICK: I'd also like to think that it makes a
noise like a lightsaber, but that's just--

1944
02:06:00,505 --> 02:06:10,077
MATT: (lightsaber sound) as it happens. The room
is now much brighter, and you can see the details

1945
02:06:10,077 --> 02:06:18,935
of the stonework around you. The mustiness seems
to almost back away instinctually from the radiant

1946
02:06:18,935 --> 02:06:21,148
light itself, almost warms the air in its
vicinity.

1947
02:06:21,148 --> 02:06:23,784
MARISHA: It smells like strawberries!

1948
02:06:23,784 --> 02:06:25,234
TALIESIN: That's me.

1949
02:06:25,234 --> 02:06:31,659
MATT: It's very weird strawberries, probably. As
the light hits the pages, the pages go almost

1950
02:06:31,659 --> 02:06:37,373
blank. The text just shrinks away to the point
where it looks like there's just tiny, tiny dots.

1951
02:06:37,373 --> 02:06:39,097
TALIESIN: I think I've solved this!

1952
02:06:39,097 --> 02:06:40,360
LAURA: What?

1953
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:45,358
TALIESIN: Let's extinguish all the lights, and
someone with low-light vision has to read it.

1954
02:06:45,358 --> 02:06:47,571
LAURA: Okay. Grog.

1955
02:06:47,571 --> 02:06:48,577
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1956
02:06:48,577 --> 02:06:52,375
TALIESIN: No. That's not funny.

1957
02:06:52,375 --> 02:06:55,109
LAURA: I mean, sure, yeah, extinguish all the
lights. I wanna go and see if I can read it.

1958
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:58,072
PATRICK: Switch off the hammer.

1959
02:06:58,072 --> 02:07:05,485
MATT: Okay. The head of the warhammer flickers
out, leaving just the handle behind. You go ahead

1960
02:07:05,485 --> 02:07:09,137
and look at it, and the text is more legible there
on the page,

1961
02:07:09,137 --> 02:07:11,203
but it's still blurred to your vision.

1962
02:07:11,203 --> 02:07:14,584
LAURA: I think I need glasses. It's blurry.

1963
02:07:14,584 --> 02:07:17,132
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody with perfect
nightvision?

1964
02:07:17,132 --> 02:07:19,094
MARISHA: Perfect nightvision?

1965
02:07:19,094 --> 02:07:21,055
PATRICK: 20-20 nightvision?

1966
02:07:21,055 --> 02:07:23,845
TALIESIN: Well, I can't see a thing.

1967
02:07:23,845 --> 02:07:26,476
MARISHA: Nothing, for you?

1968
02:07:26,476 --> 02:07:28,282
LAURA: Nah, it's blurry.

1969
02:07:28,282 --> 02:07:34,336
MARISHA: Still blurry? I look over Vex's shoulder.
Maybe, I don't know, anything? I know Primordial.

1970
02:07:34,336 --> 02:07:37,222
LIAM: Might be that we're too nice.

1971
02:07:37,222 --> 02:07:42,682
TRAVIS: Maybe if you put something in the pot and
set it on fire, by that light, you'll--

1972
02:07:42,682 --> 02:07:44,564
MARISHA: Scanlan goes up and looks at it.

1973
02:07:44,564 --> 02:07:46,564
TALIESIN: Begrudgingly.

1974
02:07:46,564 --> 02:07:54,221
MATT: Scanlan glances over. "It's fine to me. I
don't know what your problem was.

1975
02:07:54,221 --> 02:07:58,129
"No, I have no idea what's on the pages, 
I'm just messing with you."

1976
02:07:58,129 --> 02:07:59,469
(groaning)

1977
02:07:59,469 --> 02:08:00,698
MATT: "Sorry, guys!"

1978
02:08:00,698 --> 02:08:02,278
MARISHA: I thought we figured something out.

1979
02:08:02,278 --> 02:08:04,726
LAURA: That's actually a really good idea, Grog.
Maybe we should light the brazier.

1980
02:08:04,726 --> 02:08:08,128
TALIESIN: We should light the brazier. That, or
raid the cabinets we passed.

1981
02:08:08,128 --> 02:08:12,536
MATT: Allura, who's-- oh, so you're going to light
the brazier with your hand?

1982
02:08:12,536 --> 02:08:17,280
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know. I was lighting my hand.
I can do it.

1983
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:18,801
TALIESIN: We're bringing the light back.

1984
02:08:18,801 --> 02:08:23,966
MATT: Okay, so the room fills with light once
more. Kerrek, you can bring your hammer back if

1985
02:08:23,966 --> 02:08:25,149
you'd like.

1986
02:08:25,149 --> 02:08:27,311
LIAM: We're basically all running around the room
in circles.

1987
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:28,802
MATT: Yeah, you guys are just charging around.

1988
02:08:28,802 --> 02:08:35,133
MARISHA: Are we gonna light this brazier? Keyleth
goes up and just sticks her flaming hand right

1989
02:08:35,133 --> 02:08:36,746
down into the middle of the brazier.

1990
02:08:36,746 --> 02:08:42,326
MATT: Okay. Your hand hits the top of the
kindling, at which point the wood catches, and

1991
02:08:42,326 --> 02:08:49,678
there's a slight flash as the extremely explosive
materials that were within the brazier detonate,

1992
02:08:49,678 --> 02:08:59,544
causing Percival, Allura, Vex, and Vax, who were
also reading the book nearby, to all have to make

1993
02:08:59,544 --> 02:09:05,248
a dexterity saving throw. As there's a sudden
(explosion). It explodes with a force.

1994
02:09:05,248 --> 02:09:07,787
MARISHA: Do I make a dexterity save as well?

1995
02:09:07,787 --> 02:09:10,569
MATT: You don't make it, you just take the damage,
since you were at ground zero.

1996
02:09:10,569 --> 02:09:11,803
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

1997
02:09:11,803 --> 02:09:16,074
PATRICK: To be fair, I was right next to the book
as well.

1998
02:09:16,074 --> 02:09:18,687
MATT: That's right. So you go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw as well, Kerrek.

1999
02:09:18,687 --> 02:09:23,267
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2000
02:09:23,267 --> 02:09:26,394
LAURA: 22.

2001
02:09:26,394 --> 02:09:27,873
TALIESIN: 24.

2002
02:09:27,873 --> 02:09:30,542
LIAM: 16 and a Luck blown.

2003
02:09:30,542 --> 02:09:33,322
MATT: Kerrek, what'd you get?

2004
02:09:33,322 --> 02:09:36,499
PATRICK: I got a three.

2005
02:09:36,499 --> 02:09:38,497
LAURA: Oh no, Kerr!

2006
02:09:38,497 --> 02:09:46,791
MATT: Oh, Allura made it, okay. Everyone but
Kerrek made the saving throw. So Kerrek and

2007
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:54,735
Keyleth, you both take 32 points of fire damage.
The rest of you take 16. You take none because

2008
02:09:54,735 --> 02:09:56,105
you're a rogue.

2009
02:09:56,105 --> 02:10:09,192
LIAM: Yeah. I start breakdancing, doing the worm
underneath the blast. Jeez, all right. The Luck wasn't

2010
02:10:09,192 --> 02:10:12,911
blown, because the other roll was a one.

2011
02:10:12,911 --> 02:10:14,929
MARISHA: Grog! Did you see that?

2012
02:10:14,929 --> 02:10:17,928
TRAVIS: I did, but everything's really, really
bright right now.

2013
02:10:17,928 --> 02:10:23,581
MATT: Your ears are ringing from the blast of the
impact, the brazier's just, all the metal's just

2014
02:10:23,581 --> 02:10:24,883
bent outward and ruined.

2015
02:10:24,883 --> 02:10:29,167
TRAVIS: I've just got the lit-up shapes of a bunch
of people going like that.

2016
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,634
MATT: As Keyleth turns around, you can see just
her hair's blown back a bit.

2017
02:10:31,634 --> 02:10:34,006
She's like a cartoon character.

2018
02:10:34,006 --> 02:10:36,708
TALIESIN: This has happened to me dozens of
times.

2019
02:10:36,708 --> 02:10:38,051
MARISHA: That was awesome.

2020
02:10:38,051 --> 02:10:41,613
LAURA: If Raishan didn't hear us before, she
potentially heard us now.

2021
02:10:41,613 --> 02:10:44,576
TALIESIN: At least now we don't have to try and
stealth anymore.

2022
02:10:44,576 --> 02:10:49,725
MARISHA: (shouting) Is the door open? I'm sorry if
I'm speaking loudly!

2023
02:10:49,725 --> 02:10:52,120
(laughter)

2024
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,431
MATT: The door is not open.

2025
02:10:56,431 --> 02:10:58,229
MARISHA: (shouting) The door is not open?

2026
02:10:58,229 --> 02:10:59,639
LAURA: We need blood.

2027
02:10:59,639 --> 02:11:02,108
TALIESIN: The book's fine, I assume?

2028
02:11:02,108 --> 02:11:05,599
MATT: The book has burned entirely. It is
destroyed.

2029
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:06,934
TALIESIN: That's awesome.

2030
02:11:06,934 --> 02:11:08,577
TRAVIS: Who cares about books?

2031
02:11:08,577 --> 02:11:14,558
MATT: And you see Allura, who made the save but
took some damage, is at the back and is kind of

2032
02:11:14,558 --> 02:11:18,040
chuckling to herself, goes, "Well, I think now we
know the purpose of the book."

2033
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,283
MARISHA: What?

2034
02:11:19,283 --> 02:11:21,057
LAURA: Oh, that dick book.

2035
02:11:21,057 --> 02:11:22,902
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

2036
02:11:22,902 --> 02:11:32,816
MATT: "It was well-played, and curse be on the one
who thought that up."

2037
02:11:32,816 --> 02:11:36,710
LAURA: (laughs) I know who that is.

2038
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:39,783
(laughter)

2039
02:11:39,783 --> 02:11:44,501
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the smell of whatever
they used to ignite that, or was it more mystical

2040
02:11:44,501 --> 02:11:45,667
in nature?

2041
02:11:45,667 --> 02:11:54,396
MATT: It was a sort of mixture of extremely
flammable liquids. It was not black powder.

2042
02:11:54,396 --> 02:12:00,890
TALIESIN: Okay, I was just curious. All right.
Well. Let's try and pour some of the dragon blood

2043
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:02,937
into the bowl and see if that does it.

2044
02:12:02,937 --> 02:12:03,769
TRAVIS: Does what?

2045
02:12:03,769 --> 02:12:05,366
LAURA: Opens the door.

2046
02:12:05,366 --> 02:12:06,617
TRAVIS: Oh.

2047
02:12:06,617 --> 02:12:09,955
TALIESIN: Let's blow a vial, see what happens.

2048
02:12:09,955 --> 02:12:12,109
LAURA: Dragon blood is so expensive.

2049
02:12:12,109 --> 02:12:13,439
TRAVIS: Can't we just knock it down?

2050
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:18,052
LAURA: I have basilisk blood, black dragon blood,
and white dragon blood.

2051
02:12:18,052 --> 02:12:19,845
TALIESIN: Let's try basilisk and work our way up.

2052
02:12:19,845 --> 02:12:22,326
TRAVIS: They're worth 7000 gold each.

2053
02:12:22,326 --> 02:12:25,860
LAURA: I know, that's why the basilisk is better.
One basilisk vial.

2054
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:33,086
MATT: Okay, so as you uncork and let it flow, and
it's thick, syrupy, it hits and it pools. A moment

2055
02:12:33,086 --> 02:12:35,374
passes. Two moments. Nothing.

2056
02:12:35,374 --> 02:12:40,512
LAURA: Fuck. I pull out my opal dagger and I just
cut my hand and drip it in.

2057
02:12:40,512 --> 02:12:48,233
MATT: Okay. The basilisk blood that's still in
there, you bleed into the basilisk blood, and it

2058
02:12:48,233 --> 02:12:54,377
pools in the center of it. And you watch as the
blood that you just dropped gets pulled beneath

2059
02:12:54,377 --> 02:12:56,221
the surface of the basilisk blood and out of
sight.

2060
02:12:56,221 --> 02:13:00,191
LAURA: Creepy. Is the door opening?

2061
02:13:00,191 --> 02:13:03,607
MATT: From the few drops of blood you put in
there, it has not opened.

2062
02:13:03,607 --> 02:13:07,255
LAURA: It's like a kill-something sort of
situation.

2063
02:13:07,255 --> 02:13:14,948
PATRICK: Kerrek is reaching out, kind of like,
don't-don't-don't. There's a lot of things in the

2064
02:13:14,948 --> 02:13:17,924
world that shouldn't have your blood.

2065
02:13:17,924 --> 02:13:21,140
LAURA: Oh. Well, shit. (laughs)

2066
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:31,364
PATRICK: Especially something clever enough to lay
a trap like that. Might be clever enough to trick

2067
02:13:31,364 --> 02:13:34,396
a bunch of people into handing over blood.

2068
02:13:34,396 --> 02:13:38,094
TRAVIS: How far is it to the door?

2069
02:13:38,094 --> 02:13:42,334
MATT: From the pillar? About 15 feet.

2070
02:13:42,334 --> 02:13:44,371
TRAVIS: I walk over to the door.

2071
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:45,529
MATT: Okay.

2072
02:13:45,529 --> 02:13:47,707
LIAM: I'm gonna go with Grog. Yeah.

2073
02:13:47,707 --> 02:13:49,001
LAURA: Punch it!

2074
02:13:49,001 --> 02:13:50,677
TRAVIS: Can I-- would you mind--

2075
02:13:50,677 --> 02:13:54,118
TALIESIN: You guys work on your thing. I'm gonna
work on another thing. I'm gonna go over to those

2076
02:13:54,118 --> 02:13:56,197
other shelves, I'm gonna see what the fuck is up
there.

2077
02:13:56,197 --> 02:13:59,796
MARISHA: I go with Percy. I do that. Inspecting
the shelves.

2078
02:13:59,796 --> 02:14:02,188
TALIESIN: I'm gonna quick-jog to the other shelves
and take a look at those books.

2079
02:14:02,188 --> 02:14:12,527
MATT: The door begins to shift. There's a slight
shaking sensation as the bowl itself begins to

2080
02:14:12,527 --> 02:14:19,266
glow, and the basilisk's blood begins to sizzle and
burn away, almost like it's being pushed to the

2081
02:14:19,266 --> 02:14:25,327
outer edges of the bowl with just the singular
drops from your blood resting in the center. The

2082
02:14:25,327 --> 02:14:29,490
room begins to shake a bit, and you watch as dust
that had been alongside the ceiling begins to

2083
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:40,592
slightly cascade from above you. The metallic door
lifts up and reveals the other side.

2084
02:14:40,592 --> 02:14:42,701
MARISHA: Completely? It's open?

2085
02:14:42,701 --> 02:14:46,663
MATT: It's open. You do take a point of damage
from the blood that you lost.

2086
02:14:46,663 --> 02:14:48,010
LAURA: Okay.

2087
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:53,306
MATT: So you guys are just starting to push out of
the room. At which point,

2088
02:14:53,306 --> 02:14:57,398
you begin to hear laughter.

2089
02:14:57,398 --> 02:14:58,994
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck.

2090
02:14:58,994 --> 02:15:08,249
MATT: Cackling, multiple-sources laughter.
(cackling) And you watch as, down in the distance

2091
02:15:08,249 --> 02:15:13,589
of each side of the hallway from where you came
and where you're going, these little sources of

2092
02:15:13,589 --> 02:15:18,394
light suddenly spark up and begin drifting towards
you.

2093
02:15:18,394 --> 02:15:20,038
LAURA: Pike immediately casts--

2094
02:15:20,038 --> 02:15:22,077
LIAM: Beacon of Hope?

2095
02:15:22,077 --> 02:15:29,741
LAURA: No, no, no, not that. She casts the other
thing. Shouldn't she? It's undead. Holy Aura on

2096
02:15:29,741 --> 02:15:31,409
all of us.

2097
02:15:31,409 --> 02:15:33,406
MATT: Okay. What does that do?

2098
02:15:33,406 --> 02:15:41,244
LAURA: I wrote it all down. Hold on, hold on. It
is within a 30-foot radius where everybody is. It

2099
02:15:41,244 --> 02:15:47,008
sheds a five-foot radius of light on everyone.
Everybody gets advantage on saving throws. Enemies

2100
02:15:47,008 --> 02:15:55,033
who are attacking have disadvantage on everyone.
Fiends and undead who do melee attacks have to

2101
02:15:55,033 --> 02:15:56,968
make a constitution save or be blinded.

2102
02:15:56,968 --> 02:16:04,368
MATT: Okay. All right, so yeah, that's on
yourself, and it creates a 30-foot radius around

2103
02:16:04,368 --> 02:16:10,124
you. As you guys all see these sources of light
hovering towards you, the cackling getting louder

2104
02:16:10,124 --> 02:16:16,333
and louder from a source just out of view, Pike
grabs her holy symbol and slams her hand down onto

2105
02:16:16,333 --> 02:16:21,066
the stonework in the center by where the pillar
is. As it hits, there's a (explosion) sound as the

2106
02:16:21,066 --> 02:16:26,701
vibrations or impact shift through the ground, and
you feel the ground itself grow warm with radiant

2107
02:16:26,701 --> 02:16:34,268
energy as a giant circle of ancient radiant runes
begin to connect and intersect, and within that

2108
02:16:34,268 --> 02:16:37,704
circle you all kind of rush in, and as you do, you
feel the warmth of that protection come over you.

2109
02:16:37,704 --> 02:16:46,686
As you all gather, with your weapons at the ready,
you see now the sources of light, as roughly four

2110
02:16:46,686 --> 02:16:56,129
floating flame-wreathed skulls come rocketing in,
two from each side of the hallway, cackling along

2111
02:16:56,129 --> 02:16:59,207
the way. And we're gonna take a break.

2112
02:16:59,208 --> 02:17:01,352
(yelling)

2113
02:17:01,352 --> 02:17:04,031
TRAVIS: Flaming skulls?

2114
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:05,568
MATT: Flaming skulls.

2115
02:17:05,568 --> 02:17:06,850
MARISHA: Flame-wreathed skulls.

2116
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:11,654
MATT: Just floating towards you. You get the sense
that one of these may have, at one point, been

2117
02:17:11,654 --> 02:17:13,030
contained within a bag.

2118
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:15,352
LIAM: Guys, it's fine, my ten-year-old son
destroyed one of these recently.

2119
02:17:15,352 --> 02:17:17,242
We're gonna be fine.

2120
02:17:17,242 --> 02:17:18,948
TALIESIN: Firecracker outside.

2121
02:17:18,948 --> 02:17:22,741
MATT: All right, so. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We're going to go ahead and take a

2122
02:17:22,741 --> 02:17:27,031
restroom break, and we'll see where this next
chapter is.

2123
02:17:27,031 --> 02:17:29,386
LAURA: Oh my god.

2124
02:17:29,386 --> 02:32:07,788
[break]

2125
02:32:07,788 --> 02:32:12,512
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.
We're back from break. The party just found

2126
02:32:12,512 --> 02:32:16,266
themselves immediately surrounded by large,
floating, flaming skulls in the center of this

2127
02:32:16,266 --> 02:32:21,773
hallway, going towards the necromancer's sanctum.
I need you all to roll initiative, please.

2128
02:32:21,773 --> 02:32:24,876
LIAM: (sings) Get it on.

2129
02:32:24,876 --> 02:32:28,573
MARISHA: (laughing) It's the Kiss army.

2130
02:32:28,573 --> 02:32:35,527
MATT: While they're rolling their initiatives, we
had a winner in the chatroom for a Wyrmwood

2131
02:32:35,527 --> 02:32:40,560
Zebrawood complete dice tower system right here,
as well as this awesome leather thing from

2132
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:44,879
Wyrmwood, here, they have this nice leather band
as well. The winner is heartman_, by the way,

2133
02:32:44,879 --> 02:32:46,523
congratulations, heartman_.

2134
02:32:46,523 --> 02:32:48,169
MARISHA: I think you have Zebrawood.

2135
02:32:48,169 --> 02:32:50,764
TALIESIN: Zebrawood is, I believe, the one that I
have.

2136
02:32:50,764 --> 02:32:59,524
MATT: Delightful. So congratulations, we'll get
this to you ASAP. All righty. So. Getting

2137
02:32:59,524 --> 02:33:02,406
initiative scores here from people. 25 to 20.

2138
02:33:02,406 --> 02:33:03,879
MARISHA: Oh wait, we're rolling initiative.

2139
02:33:03,879 --> 02:33:05,057
MATT: Yes.

2140
02:33:05,057 --> 02:33:06,023
TRAVIS: Jesus.

2141
02:33:06,023 --> 02:33:11,496
MARISHA: Fuck me. That's cocked. Natural 20.

2142
02:33:11,496 --> 02:33:13,470
MATT: All right, so.

2143
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:16,950
MARISHA: Why can't I have these when it really
makes sense?

2144
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:18,192
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

2145
02:33:18,192 --> 02:33:19,722
MARISHA: 22 total.

2146
02:33:19,722 --> 02:33:21,048
LIAM: 21.

2147
02:33:21,048 --> 02:33:23,313
TALIESIN: 22 for Scanlan.

2148
02:33:23,313 --> 02:33:25,925
MATT: Whoa! Scanlan's always in the rear.

2149
02:33:25,925 --> 02:33:27,433
TALIESIN: He rolled a natural 20.

2150
02:33:27,433 --> 02:33:30,773
MARISHA: Me and Scanlan, nat-20 brothers! For
Scanlan who's not here.

2151
02:33:30,773 --> 02:33:41,852
MATT: That's awesome. Vax and Scanlan at the top.
All right. 20 to 15.

2152
02:33:41,852 --> 02:33:43,143
LAURA: 16 for Vex.

2153
02:33:43,143 --> 02:33:44,595
TALIESIN: 17.

2154
02:33:44,595 --> 02:33:48,845
MATT: Percy, Vex. 15 to ten?

2155
02:33:48,845 --> 02:33:51,724
TRAVIS: Me. 14.

2156
02:33:51,724 --> 02:33:53,581
MATT: All righty.

2157
02:33:53,581 --> 02:34:04,141
PATRICK: Just out of curiosity, do you allow
people to delay their action to

2158
02:34:04,141 --> 02:34:05,775
act later in the turn?

2159
02:34:05,775 --> 02:34:10,798
MATT: You can hold an action, meaning you still
take your turn, you still move, but you can hold

2160
02:34:10,798 --> 02:34:16,701
your action for a trigger. So like, I will hold my
action to attack if something comes in range. Or I

2161
02:34:16,701 --> 02:34:20,651
can hold my action to cast a spell when a certain
creature does something. But you still take your

2162
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:22,771
turn, you don't move the turn order.

2163
02:34:22,771 --> 02:34:23,921
TRAVIS: What'd Pike roll?

2164
02:34:23,921 --> 02:34:25,522
LAURA: Pike rolled a nine.

2165
02:34:25,522 --> 02:34:27,986
MATT: Pike at the end. Kerrek, what'd you get?

2166
02:34:27,986 --> 02:34:30,286
PATRICK: A one.

2167
02:34:30,286 --> 02:34:32,132
MATT: Oh, Kerr.

2168
02:34:32,132 --> 02:34:33,366
LIAM: Number one.

2169
02:34:33,366 --> 02:34:35,046
MARISHA: Pike?

2170
02:34:35,046 --> 02:34:36,297
LAURA: Nine.

2171
02:34:36,297 --> 02:34:37,921
MARISHA: Who rolled one?

2172
02:34:37,921 --> 02:34:39,034
LAURA: Kerr.

2173
02:34:39,034 --> 02:34:43,692
MATT: It's okay. You and Kima are down there. All
right, so.

2174
02:34:43,692 --> 02:34:45,002
PATRICK: The term is anchor-man.

2175
02:34:45,002 --> 02:34:46,595
LAURA: I like it.

2176
02:34:46,595 --> 02:34:50,437
MATT: All righty. So, at the top of the round, as
these skulls are beginning to find their way in

2177
02:34:50,437 --> 02:34:54,980
towards the cavern towards you, as you've all
circled around Pike in the center of this chamber

2178
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:58,647
here, I would like Scanlan and Vax to go first.

2179
02:34:58,647 --> 02:35:01,769
LIAM: All right. After you, Scanman.

2180
02:35:01,769 --> 02:35:06,585
TALIESIN: I can turn myself invisible? It's a
level three spell?

2181
02:35:06,585 --> 02:35:07,702
MATT: You can.

2182
02:35:07,702 --> 02:35:14,545
TALIESIN: I'm gonna turn invisible and back up
against the northern wall in the corner and see if

2183
02:35:14,545 --> 02:35:15,996
the skulls notice.

2184
02:35:15,996 --> 02:35:24,171
MATT: Okay. So Scanlan is gonna go invisible and
back up here.

2185
02:35:24,171 --> 02:35:26,298
MARISHA: It's a 2nd-level spell.

2186
02:35:26,298 --> 02:35:28,338
MATT: All righty. 2nd level.

2187
02:35:28,338 --> 02:35:32,770
TALIESIN: And I'm going to hold my action until I
find out whether or not--

2188
02:35:32,770 --> 02:35:34,428
oh, invisible is my action.

2189
02:35:34,428 --> 02:35:36,082
MATT: Casting the spell is your action.

2190
02:35:36,082 --> 02:35:38,536
TALIESIN: All right. I'm gonna back up, and yeah.

2191
02:35:38,536 --> 02:35:44,310
MATT: Okay. So you back up against the wall there.
Okay. So that's your turn. Vax.

2192
02:35:44,310 --> 02:35:50,096
LIAM: Can you point to where I am in that scrum? I
can't tell. I'm going to move to the opposite wall

2193
02:35:50,096 --> 02:35:51,818
that Scanlan just went to.

2194
02:35:51,818 --> 02:35:54,217
MATT: So over here?

2195
02:35:54,217 --> 02:35:58,614
LIAM: Yeah, and I'll fly ten feet-- I'm winged, so
I'll be ten feet in the air as well.

2196
02:35:58,614 --> 02:36:01,340
MATT: Okay. I'll put you up on here.

2197
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:08,032
LIAM: And I'm gonna huck a pair of daggers at-- I
hope this is the right way-- the one on this side

2198
02:36:08,032 --> 02:36:09,498
that's closest to you.

2199
02:36:09,498 --> 02:36:11,140
MATT: Right here. Okay, go for it.

2200
02:36:11,140 --> 02:36:16,943
LIAM: That's shit. And then the second one--

2201
02:36:16,943 --> 02:36:20,491
LAURA: Well, don't write it off, it was 15, that
first one.

2202
02:36:20,491 --> 02:36:23,342
LIAM: That's true, it's a 15 and then a 23.

2203
02:36:23,342 --> 02:36:25,031
MATT: Both hit.

2204
02:36:25,031 --> 02:36:34,987
LIAM: Hey! All right, so first one is with
Whisper. That is four plus eight is 12, plus

2205
02:36:34,987 --> 02:36:44,818
psychic damage, which is 19 for the first hit. And
from the venom dagger that I'm throwing next, that

2206
02:36:44,818 --> 02:36:48,358
is four plus six is ten. Ten total.

2207
02:36:48,358 --> 02:36:53,309
MATT: So 19 points of damage total. Awesome. That
end your turn?

2208
02:36:53,309 --> 02:36:54,905
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

2209
02:36:54,905 --> 02:36:56,326
MATT: All right. That brings us to Keyleth.

2210
02:36:56,326 --> 02:36:58,864
MARISHA: Oh dear god, I knew you were gonna say
that. Hang on, hang on, I'm looking up the

2211
02:36:58,864 --> 02:37:02,201
parameters of the spell. Let me see. L-M-N-O--

2212
02:37:02,201 --> 02:37:06,996
TRAVIS: What happened when he hit 'em with those
daggers?

2213
02:37:06,996 --> 02:37:13,546
MATT: As both these daggers slam into the skull,
you watch as the flames themselves that are kind

2214
02:37:13,546 --> 02:37:16,833
of wreathing around them, the skull just ducks out
of the way, but the blade still catches and

2215
02:37:16,833 --> 02:37:22,474
scrapes across the side of the bone, and it has to
right itself, but then it gets right back into the

2216
02:37:22,474 --> 02:37:26,183
place it was. It's taking damage, and you can see
portions of the bone are starting to crack and

2217
02:37:26,183 --> 02:37:29,888
break, but it's still, you know, still holding
itself aloft.

2218
02:37:29,888 --> 02:37:32,074
LAURA: Did its little jawbone go (chattering
teeth)?

2219
02:37:32,074 --> 02:37:40,590
MATT: Not yet. It's not its turn yet. It's an
action to chatter. I'll get you, He-Man! No.

2220
02:37:40,590 --> 02:37:42,403
LIAM: You boob!

2221
02:37:42,403 --> 02:37:52,195
MATT: (sings) Oh my god do I pray. Anyway. Sorry.
Oh, internet. Never change.

2222
02:37:52,195 --> 02:37:55,560
MARISHA: (sings) For a revolution.

2223
02:37:55,560 --> 02:37:57,305
MATT: So what are you doing for your action,
Keyleth?

2224
02:37:57,305 --> 02:37:58,496
MARISHA: Huh?

2225
02:37:58,496 --> 02:37:59,875
TALIESIN: She's inspiring.

2226
02:37:59,875 --> 02:38:01,096
MARISHA: I got inspired?

2227
02:38:01,096 --> 02:38:02,593
MATT: No. What are you doing on your turn.

2228
02:38:02,593 --> 02:38:06,190
TRAVIS: Did you stick cotton in your ears during
the break?

2229
02:38:06,190 --> 02:38:13,487
MARISHA: Sorry, I got distracted. Okay.

2230
02:38:13,487 --> 02:38:16,767
MATT: Next to Allura, and you have Kerrek to your
other side.

2231
02:38:16,767 --> 02:38:19,191
MARISHA: Which direction were we heading?

2232
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:23,903
MATT: You were heading this direction. The giant
gate was here, and it lifted up, and then all the

2233
02:38:23,903 --> 02:38:25,816
skulls swarmed in from that side.

2234
02:38:25,816 --> 02:38:27,690
MARISHA: There's only two right now?

2235
02:38:27,690 --> 02:38:30,921
MATT: There's four, there's two on this side, two
on this side.

2236
02:38:30,921 --> 02:38:49,066
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Moonbeam on...
hm. Let me do this one. That guy. That make sense?

2237
02:38:49,066 --> 02:38:55,648
So it's 120 foot, it's a concentration spell up to
a minute, and it's a five-foot radius,

2238
02:38:55,648 --> 02:39:09,298
40-foot-high cylinder. It causes searing pain and
takes 2d10 radiant damage after a constitution

2239
02:39:09,298 --> 02:39:10,717
saving throw.

2240
02:39:10,717 --> 02:39:14,291
MATT: Okay, so constitution saving throw on each
of these guys here?

2241
02:39:14,291 --> 02:39:15,575
MARISHA: It's a five-foot radius.

2242
02:39:15,575 --> 02:39:19,323
MATT: Okay, so you can hit one-- oh, if you hit
there, you can hit 'em both.

2243
02:39:19,323 --> 02:39:22,110
MARISHA: Can I? Then I do that.

2244
02:39:22,110 --> 02:39:27,825
MATT: All righty. And they-- that is a 16.

2245
02:39:27,825 --> 02:39:29,174
MARISHA: Fail.

2246
02:39:29,174 --> 02:39:31,376
MATT: And a 13. So no, they fail 'em both.

2247
02:39:31,376 --> 02:39:33,360
(cheering)

2248
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:41,614
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. Above average. Six plus
seven is 13 points of damage.

2249
02:39:41,614 --> 02:39:43,490
MATT: 13 points of damage to both of them.

2250
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:46,409
MARISHA: You know, just a little bit of radiant
damage.

2251
02:39:46,409 --> 02:39:54,891
MATT: So as the beam bursts out from the sky, you
see the white radiant nature energy burst around

2252
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:59,081
them, and the flames seem to subside for a moment
as the one that's already been damaged by Vax

2253
02:39:59,081 --> 02:40:06,153
almost stumbles to the floor, then picks itself
back up, its flame flickering more so than the

2254
02:40:06,153 --> 02:40:10,289
allies around you. That end your turn, Keyleth?
You gonna stay where you are or you gonna move?

2255
02:40:10,289 --> 02:40:12,241
MARISHA: I'm on the-- are we all on the carpet?

2256
02:40:12,241 --> 02:40:14,928
MATT: No, no one's been on the carpet.

2257
02:40:14,928 --> 02:40:22,898
MARISHA: We never did that. Then I will back away
towards me and towards the southeast corner.

2258
02:40:22,898 --> 02:40:25,647
MATT: Over here? Okay.

2259
02:40:25,647 --> 02:40:28,003
MARISHA: Yeah. Southeast to you.

2260
02:40:28,003 --> 02:40:29,021
MATT: More south?

2261
02:40:29,021 --> 02:40:31,333
MARISHA: No, no, that's right, that's right.
That's good.

2262
02:40:31,333 --> 02:40:44,255
MATT: That ends your turn? All right. It is now
the flame skulls' turn. So. All four of these

2263
02:40:44,255 --> 02:40:50,399
skulls, you watch as the flames swirl around the
head, pour into the skull itself, and for a

2264
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:56,276
second, the flame almost goes dark, as all of a
sudden the eyes burst into angry fire, the mouth

2265
02:40:56,276 --> 02:41:01,532
grows extremely bright, and a single red beam
streaks forth from the jaw to the center of the

2266
02:41:01,532 --> 02:41:10,388
room. Four of these beams in different directions
here, followed by four simultaneous familiar

2267
02:41:10,388 --> 02:41:14,293
explosions as four separate Fireballs rock the
room.

2268
02:41:14,293 --> 02:41:16,473
LIAM: Four. Separate. Fireballs.

2269
02:41:16,473 --> 02:41:18,770
TRAVIS: Fuck.

2270
02:41:18,770 --> 02:41:21,127
LAURA: We're gonna die just from fucking--

2271
02:41:21,127 --> 02:41:26,243
LIAM: Wow, look at that. Everybody.

2272
02:41:26,243 --> 02:41:28,093
MATT: Yeah, you guys clustered right there.

2273
02:41:28,093 --> 02:41:30,507
LAURA: Well, we didn't get a chance to move!

2274
02:41:30,507 --> 02:41:32,984
MARISHA: This is the room!

2275
02:41:32,984 --> 02:41:35,918
MATT: Well no, you guys said you all were gonna
back in around Pike,

2276
02:41:35,918 --> 02:41:37,340
and you haven't had your turn yet.

2277
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:39,655
MARISHA: It's also still the room.

2278
02:41:39,655 --> 02:41:42,793
MATT: I know. I know. This happens, guys. Sorry.

2279
02:41:42,793 --> 02:41:46,151
TRAVIS: Like, where else were we gonna go? It's a
huge explosion.

2280
02:41:46,151 --> 02:41:52,159
MATT: Not knowing or seeing where Sam went, they
all focus here, which will affect everybody. So I

2281
02:41:52,159 --> 02:41:55,422
need everybody to make four dexterity saving
throws. Now, mind you--

2282
02:41:55,422 --> 02:41:57,340
MARISHA: Everyone except Scanlan? Or still
Scanlan?

2283
02:41:57,340 --> 02:41:58,692
MATT: Everyone except for Scanlan.

2284
02:41:58,692 --> 02:42:01,121
LAURA: And everybody's got advantage on every
single one of those rolls.

2285
02:42:01,121 --> 02:42:02,501
MARISHA: Wait, dex throws?

2286
02:42:02,501 --> 02:42:04,386
MATT: All saving throws you have advantage on.

2287
02:42:04,386 --> 02:42:06,398
TALIESIN: Four saving throws with advantage.

2288
02:42:06,398 --> 02:42:08,901
LIAM: You crazy motherfucker.

2289
02:42:08,901 --> 02:42:12,523
TRAVIS: God damn it, that's the same number.

2290
02:42:12,523 --> 02:42:16,214
MATT: You're trying to beat a 13.

2291
02:42:16,214 --> 02:42:24,282
MARISHA: How many do we-- oh, we have to roll it
each time?

2292
02:42:24,282 --> 02:42:26,029
MATT: Yeah, for each one.

2293
02:42:26,029 --> 02:42:41,338
MARISHA: Natural 20 on my second. We're trying to
beat a 13?

2294
02:42:41,338 --> 02:42:43,496
MATT: Trying to beat a 13.

2295
02:42:43,496 --> 02:42:46,325
MARISHA: I cleared all of them.

2296
02:42:46,325 --> 02:42:47,768
TALIESIN: Cleared all of them.

2297
02:42:47,768 --> 02:42:52,218
LIAM: Cleared all of them. Evasion.

2298
02:42:52,218 --> 02:42:54,393
LAURA: Wait, I gotta do them for Pike.

2299
02:42:54,393 --> 02:42:58,527
MARISHA: No rolls for Scanlan. Okay.

2300
02:42:58,527 --> 02:43:17,669
LAURA: Fuck. (sighs) Do I have to roll for
Trinket, too? Oh, god.

2301
02:43:17,669 --> 02:43:19,448
MATT: Everyone was there.

2302
02:43:19,448 --> 02:43:24,461
LAURA: Okay, Pike saves two and fails two. Vex
saves all.

2303
02:43:24,461 --> 02:43:26,119
MATT: Okay.

2304
02:43:26,119 --> 02:43:30,308
LAURA: God.

2305
02:43:30,308 --> 02:43:38,254
TRAVIS: These little disembodied bastards are
tough.

2306
02:43:38,254 --> 02:43:40,363
LAURA: Trinket only saves against one.

2307
02:43:40,363 --> 02:43:42,255
TRAVIS: What are these called?

2308
02:43:42,255 --> 02:43:43,594
PATRICK: Even with advantage?

2309
02:43:43,594 --> 02:43:45,164
LAURA: Even with advantage.

2310
02:43:45,164 --> 02:43:46,514
TALIESIN: It's her magic power.

2311
02:43:46,514 --> 02:43:52,189
LAURA: Trinket just constantly-- I didn't add
anything. Oh, well, he had a plus two.

2312
02:43:52,189 --> 02:43:53,333
MATT: Grog.

2313
02:43:53,333 --> 02:43:56,619
TRAVIS: I failed the first two, succeeded on the
second two. Ten, ten, 21, 21.

2314
02:43:56,619 --> 02:44:06,656
MATT: Okay. So you take 76 points of fire damage.
Percy.

2315
02:44:06,656 --> 02:44:08,569
TALIESIN: Save, save, save, save.

2316
02:44:08,569 --> 02:44:13,666
MATT: Okay. So you take-- Grog, I said 78, right?

2317
02:44:13,666 --> 02:44:16,380
TRAVIS: You said 72.

2318
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:32,729
MATT: Sorry, 72. That is 48 points of fire damage
to you, Percy.

2319
02:44:32,729 --> 02:44:38,527
MARISHA: You saved from all of 'em? Same. 17,
natural 20, 14, 18.

2320
02:44:38,527 --> 02:44:48,894
TALIESIN: 42 points of damage? Wait, how much?

2321
02:44:48,894 --> 02:44:54,659
MATT: Sorry, this is a lot of Fireballs and a lot
of rolls right now. So for Percival, altogether,

2322
02:44:54,659 --> 02:45:05,314
if you made all the saves, it would be-- shit.
Okay.

2323
02:45:05,314 --> 02:45:07,356
TALIESIN: Some mild asbestos in the coat.

2324
02:45:07,356 --> 02:45:08,831
MARISHA: Made of polyester.

2325
02:45:08,831 --> 02:45:21,984
MATT: We'll say, for the sake of this and the ease
of the damage here, you take 56 points of fire

2326
02:45:21,984 --> 02:45:23,206
damage, Percy.

2327
02:45:23,206 --> 02:45:24,264
TALIESIN: How much, sorry?

2328
02:45:24,264 --> 02:45:25,800
MATT: 56 points of fire damage.

2329
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:29,160
MARISHA: If you saved against all of them, 56?

2330
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:30,499
MATT: Yes.

2331
02:45:30,499 --> 02:45:32,108
TRAVIS: Should I have taken more?

2332
02:45:32,108 --> 02:45:35,352
MATT: You technically would've taken-- no, you
took 70.

2333
02:45:35,352 --> 02:45:36,823
TRAVIS: I failed two.

2334
02:45:36,823 --> 02:45:38,812
MATT: That's right, you failed two. So that would
be...

2335
02:45:38,812 --> 02:45:47,844
MARISHA: That's with a nat 20?

2336
02:45:47,844 --> 02:45:49,071
MATT: You take 88.

2337
02:45:49,071 --> 02:45:50,749
LAURA: Oh my lord.

2338
02:45:50,749 --> 02:45:52,953
MARISHA: With a nat 20, you still take half
damage?

2339
02:45:52,953 --> 02:45:54,916
MATT: Yeah. So how many did you get, Keyleth?

2340
02:45:54,916 --> 02:45:57,928
MARISHA: I saved all of them, so I'm at 50 hit
points.

2341
02:45:57,928 --> 02:46:01,776
MATT: Okay. Kerrek, how many did you save?

2342
02:46:01,776 --> 02:46:05,121
PATRICK: I did, I made all of them, thanks to the
advantage.

2343
02:46:05,121 --> 02:46:06,828
LIAM: Nice, Kerrek.

2344
02:46:06,828 --> 02:46:09,223
MATT: So you take 56 points of fire damage.

2345
02:46:09,223 --> 02:46:12,899
LIAM: I saved all of them with Evasion. That's
zero, yeah?

2346
02:46:12,899 --> 02:46:14,344
MATT: Yeah, so you take zero.

2347
02:46:14,344 --> 02:46:15,613
LIAM: Yeah, flat against the ground.

2348
02:46:15,613 --> 02:46:17,579
MATT: You just duck out of the way. Vex?

2349
02:46:17,579 --> 02:46:19,380
LAURA: I saved against all of them.

2350
02:46:19,380 --> 02:46:20,860
MATT: 56 points of fire damage.

2351
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:22,586
LAURA: So I'm at 57 hit points now.

2352
02:46:22,586 --> 02:46:25,185
MATT: Okay. Pike failed two?

2353
02:46:25,185 --> 02:46:27,882
LAURA: She failed two of them, yeah, so 88.

2354
02:46:27,882 --> 02:46:30,200
MATT: 88, but half that, because she has fire
resistance, so 44.

2355
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:39,654
LAURA: Oh, thank god. Okay. That's good, that's
good. And then Trinket only got one, so he's in my

2356
02:46:39,654 --> 02:46:43,146
necklace. Already.

2357
02:46:43,146 --> 02:46:44,467
LIAM: Luckily, luckily.

2358
02:46:44,467 --> 02:46:50,476
MATT: You can bring him out and heal him in a
minute, if you want to. That brings Allura,

2359
02:46:50,476 --> 02:47:01,682
through her Barrier and extra hit points, that
brings her to-- okay, there we go. And Kima also

2360
02:47:01,682 --> 02:47:07,434
failed two, so she took... All righty.

2361
02:47:07,434 --> 02:47:11,355
PATRICK: If I'm still hugging Grog, can I use him
as partial cover?

2362
02:47:11,355 --> 02:47:13,391
(laughter)

2363
02:47:13,391 --> 02:47:18,399
MATT: Going forward, you can, yes. From the
curling flames of the arcane blasts,

2364
02:47:18,399 --> 02:47:26,089
unfortunately, not that much cover from that.
However, they all then go ahead and scoot back

2365
02:47:26,089 --> 02:47:31,149
towards the wall. The holy radius itself is
starting to affect them, so this one is starting

2366
02:47:31,149 --> 02:47:34,307
to back up in this direction, and these two are
going to go ahead and this one's going to curl

2367
02:47:34,307 --> 02:47:40,630
around the fallen stonework and land there. That
is going to end their turn.

2368
02:47:40,630 --> 02:47:42,176
TRAVIS: We're in a fucking kill box.

2369
02:47:42,176 --> 02:47:44,599
TALIESIN: It's a box of kill.

2370
02:47:44,599 --> 02:47:47,065
MATT: Now that brings us to Percival's turn.

2371
02:47:47,065 --> 02:47:54,201
TALIESIN: I'm irritated. So which was the one that
you were shooting at?

2372
02:47:54,201 --> 02:47:56,979
MARISHA: There's one that's almost dead. What's
the one that's almost dead?

2373
02:47:56,979 --> 02:47:58,619
LIAM: Yeah, the one that Matt just touched.

2374
02:47:58,619 --> 02:48:10,546
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start with him, and I'm going
to, just to be a dick, I'm going to pull some

2375
02:48:10,546 --> 02:48:13,680
deadeye and a sharpshooter on this one.

2376
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,046
LIAM: Get out of the box!

2377
02:48:15,046 --> 02:48:17,616
TALIESIN: So I'm going to start with him, taking a
shot with Animus.

2378
02:48:17,616 --> 02:48:20,094
LAURA: Animus?

2379
02:48:20,094 --> 02:48:26,756
TALIESIN: With the Animus gun, which is, with the
sharpshooter on, is 26 to hit.

2380
02:48:26,756 --> 02:48:28,761
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so roll damage for that.

2381
02:48:28,761 --> 02:48:37,982
TALIESIN: That's-- sorry, I'm a little out of it.
What do I need? I need one of these. Oh, I'll use

2382
02:48:37,982 --> 02:48:54,607
this one, it's prettier. Just counting the dice.
That's nice! That's 17, 27 points of damage, plus

2383
02:48:54,607 --> 02:48:56,088
two points of psychic damage.

2384
02:48:56,088 --> 02:49:00,802
MATT: Okay. As you take your first shot, the one
skull's just trying to duck around the partially

2385
02:49:00,802 --> 02:49:05,448
crumbled wall, you catch it right before it goes
behind cover, and as your bullet hits from the

2386
02:49:05,448 --> 02:49:11,413
side, the skull just explodes and shatters into a
burst of flame and broken bone, expelled and

2387
02:49:11,413 --> 02:49:13,566
extinguished on the battlefield.

2388
02:49:13,566 --> 02:49:15,150
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

2389
02:49:15,150 --> 02:49:16,551
TALIESIN: Next shot. (laughs)

2390
02:49:16,551 --> 02:49:20,884
MARISHA: Do you get a grit point? You get a grit
point back.

2391
02:49:20,884 --> 02:49:24,288
TALIESIN: I killed it, so grit point back.
Actually, and I'm going to spend another grit

2392
02:49:24,288 --> 02:49:28,818
point for the same shot. So yes. That's--

2393
02:49:28,818 --> 02:49:31,380
TRAVIS: These are not living creatures, though,
right?

2394
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:32,596
MATT: They are not.

2395
02:49:32,596 --> 02:49:37,219
TALIESIN: I'm gonna just switch to the one-- yeah,
just gonna switch

2396
02:49:37,219 --> 02:49:38,712
so that we're not flanked by the--

2397
02:49:38,712 --> 02:49:40,290
TRAVIS: Flaming jungle mob?

2398
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:45,040
TALIESIN: Same sharpshooter, same thing. Same
attack. 26.

2399
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:46,467
MATT: Hits.

2400
02:49:46,467 --> 02:49:55,214
TALIESIN: That's not as good, but it's okay. 22
points of damage,

2401
02:49:55,214 --> 02:49:56,443
plus six points of psychic damage.

2402
02:49:56,443 --> 02:50:04,524
MATT: Okay. All righty. So this shot impacts, and
it sends it slamming into the wall, and it rights

2403
02:50:04,524 --> 02:50:10,573
itself back in its position, but you can see
noticeable cracks across the bone cranium of it,

2404
02:50:10,573 --> 02:50:14,835
and little bits of fire are poking through areas
where it's starting to come apart, but it's still

2405
02:50:14,835 --> 02:50:16,598
keeping itself together at the moment.

2406
02:50:16,598 --> 02:50:25,332
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at it.
Sharpshooter, but not with the deadeye. Pew-pew.

2407
02:50:25,332 --> 02:50:26,802
Not as good a shot. 16?

2408
02:50:26,802 --> 02:50:29,161
MATT: 16 still hits.

2409
02:50:29,161 --> 02:50:30,589
TALIESIN: That'll do.

2410
02:50:30,589 --> 02:50:32,802
MARISHA: Kill it! Kill it!

2411
02:50:32,802 --> 02:50:36,770
TALIESIN: That's 20 points of damage, with four
points of psychic damage.

2412
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:43,255
MATT: That does it. Another blast echoes through
as the gunshot goes off. You watch as the

2413
02:50:43,255 --> 02:50:48,043
secondary light source from that side of the
hallway just is immediately extinguished. That

2414
02:50:48,043 --> 02:50:51,751
hallway goes dark once more, the two glowing
lights untouched on the area

2415
02:50:51,751 --> 02:50:53,665
you came from still standing.

2416
02:50:53,665 --> 02:51:02,514
TALIESIN: I do a quick reload, and I run up the
wall to-- yeah, that way, but to an angle? Yeah,

2417
02:51:02,514 --> 02:51:04,067
I'm gonna perch up there.

2418
02:51:04,067 --> 02:51:05,879
MARISHA: Grit point back.

2419
02:51:05,879 --> 02:51:07,873
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I get the grit point back.
Thank you.

2420
02:51:07,873 --> 02:51:14,755
MATT: I like how Keyleth is becoming your paper
clip for this battle.

2421
02:51:14,755 --> 02:51:16,595
MARISHA: Did you know?

2422
02:51:16,595 --> 02:51:19,276
TALIESIN: I'm trying to write.

2423
02:51:19,276 --> 02:51:28,734
PATRICK: Sorry, I meant to mention this before.
And this might not be relevant because everyone

2424
02:51:28,734 --> 02:51:34,668
has just made eight saving throws or rolled eight
saving throw dice. Everyone close to me, because

2425
02:51:34,668 --> 02:51:39,937
of my Aura of Divinity, gets a plus three because
of my charisma bonus.

2426
02:51:39,937 --> 02:51:41,543
MATT: That's true.

2427
02:51:41,543 --> 02:51:45,893
PATRICK: I would not bring it up after the fact if
that was not just such

2428
02:51:45,893 --> 02:51:48,557
an ungodly buttload of damage.

2429
02:51:48,557 --> 02:51:50,264
TRAVIS: Doesn't affect my rolls.

2430
02:51:50,264 --> 02:51:53,619
MATT: That would affect your rolls. You would get
plus three to any--

2431
02:51:53,619 --> 02:51:55,092
TRAVIS: Still didn't make it, though.

2432
02:51:55,092 --> 02:52:00,039
MATT: So it didn't help Grog. Pike is the only one
that's near you that would've gotten the benefit.

2433
02:52:00,039 --> 02:52:02,611
LAURA: That would've gotten Pike up to one of--
she would've failed one of them.

2434
02:52:02,611 --> 02:52:11,841
MATT: Okay. So take 22 points of fire damage off--
or no, it would be half that. 11 points.

2435
02:52:11,841 --> 02:52:13,038
Take 11 points off.

2436
02:52:13,038 --> 02:52:14,598
LIAM: That's for saves, not on attacks, right?

2437
02:52:14,598 --> 02:52:15,690
MATT: Correct, just saves.

2438
02:52:15,690 --> 02:52:16,799
LAURA: So add 11 points back.

2439
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:19,281
MARISHA: Yeah, I saved all mine. You saved all
yours.

2440
02:52:19,281 --> 02:52:21,929
PATRICK: But didn't Grog roll tens, and he needs a 13?

2441
02:52:22,117 --> 02:52:24,607
MATT: So what'd you roll as your final rolls?

2442
02:52:24,607 --> 02:52:25,956
TRAVIS: Ten, ten, 21, 21.

2443
02:52:25,956 --> 02:52:28,955
MATT: So that would've made 13 roll. So yeah, that
would've.

2444
02:52:28,955 --> 02:52:30,347
LAURA: You would've saved on everything.

2445
02:52:30,347 --> 02:52:36,712
TRAVIS: Hey! So if you saved on all of them, how
many points of damage would you take?

2446
02:52:36,712 --> 02:52:38,315
MATT: All of them would have been 56.

2447
02:52:38,315 --> 02:52:39,769
TRAVIS: Got it, 56.

2448
02:52:39,769 --> 02:52:46,577
LAURA: Trinket still would've failed three. Just
to put that out there, he rolled so poorly.

2449
02:52:46,577 --> 02:52:47,610
MATT: Even with the plus three?

2450
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:50,972
LAURA: Even with the plus three, Trinket would not
have gotten up to 13 on three of those.

2451
02:52:50,972 --> 02:52:52,023
TRAVIS: Thank you, Kerr!

2452
02:52:52,023 --> 02:52:55,572
TALIESIN: You know, I've been led to believe that
bears had more affinity with dealing with forest

2453
02:52:55,572 --> 02:53:00,358
fires in general. I feel it's just-- this is
definitely a problem.

2454
02:53:00,358 --> 02:53:01,697
LIAM: Somewhere, Sam is laughing.

2455
02:53:01,697 --> 02:53:04,237
LAURA: Oh, poor Trinket. He's just--

2456
02:53:04,237 --> 02:53:06,375
LIAM: He's good at cuddles.

2457
02:53:06,375 --> 02:53:07,998
TALIESIN: Do you have a bald bear?

2458
02:53:07,998 --> 02:53:09,601
MARISHA: With a little singed hair?

2459
02:53:09,601 --> 02:53:13,613
MATT: All right, Percy, that ends your turn?

2460
02:53:13,613 --> 02:53:14,958
TRAVIS: Percy, does that end your turn?

2461
02:53:14,958 --> 02:53:16,345
MATT: Vex, you're up.

2462
02:53:16,345 --> 02:53:26,948
LAURA: Oh, I'm up. Okay. I'm going to shoot them.
I'm going to shoot the one closer to you.

2463
02:53:26,948 --> 02:53:28,391
MATT: Okay, there you go.

2464
02:53:28,391 --> 02:53:33,924
LAURA: That definitely hits.

2465
02:53:33,924 --> 02:53:35,308
MATT: Okay.

2466
02:53:35,308 --> 02:53:49,344
LAURA: 16 damage plus three lightning damage.

2467
02:53:49,344 --> 02:53:50,946
MATT: Okay, got it.

2468
02:53:50,946 --> 02:53:57,049
LAURA: And then, fuck me, I Hunter's Mark him.

2469
02:53:57,049 --> 02:54:02,450
MATT: (laughs) Okay. He has been Hunter's Marked.

2470
02:54:02,450 --> 02:54:10,480
LAURA: I attack him again. Natural 20!

2471
02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:13,069
(cheering)

2472
02:54:13,069 --> 02:54:14,325
MATT: Well, there you go.

2473
02:54:14,325 --> 02:54:18,386
TALIESIN: I was gonna say, somehow a skull is
giving you shade, and now he's not.

2474
02:54:18,386 --> 02:54:30,826
LAURA: 20 plus eight lightning damage plus eight
Hunter's Mark.

2475
02:54:30,826 --> 02:54:33,449
'Cause you double all your dice, right?

2476
02:54:33,449 --> 02:54:39,611
MATT: You double the dice, yeah. So that's 20 plus
eight plus another eight.

2477
02:54:39,611 --> 02:54:41,937
LAURA: So 28 plus eight lightning damage.

2478
02:54:41,937 --> 02:54:49,243
MATT: Yeah. That secondary arrow happens to just
hit right on the suture at the side of the skull,

2479
02:54:49,243 --> 02:54:54,366
and as it hits, the arrow cuts through and causes
the skull to crack in half, and you hear this kind

2480
02:54:54,366 --> 02:55:00,549
of shriek, and the laughter fades, as it pulls
back and the flame just flickers out, and the two

2481
02:55:00,549 --> 02:55:04,431
pieces of bone just clatter to the ground and
break across the stone.

2482
02:55:04,431 --> 02:55:16,894
LAURA: I move away from him into the-- oh, on the
opposite side of Percy.

2483
02:55:16,894 --> 02:55:25,238
MATT: Okay, so this way? 30, you can get about
there. All right. That ends your turn, Vex. Grog,

2484
02:55:25,238 --> 02:55:26,215
you're up.

2485
02:55:26,215 --> 02:55:28,794
TRAVIS: (yells) I run at the last remaining
skull.

2486
02:55:28,794 --> 02:55:31,116
LIAM: Hey you guys!

2487
02:55:31,116 --> 02:55:32,657
TRAVIS: In a rage.

2488
02:55:32,657 --> 02:55:36,838
MATT: You get right up to it.

2489
02:55:36,838 --> 02:55:38,975
TRAVIS: I'd like to play teeball, please.

2490
02:55:38,975 --> 02:55:40,259
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2491
02:55:40,259 --> 02:55:46,281
TRAVIS: With this new Dwarven Thrower. Should've
tried throwing it, but too late for that. With

2492
02:55:46,281 --> 02:55:48,242
reckless, great weapon master, please.

2493
02:55:48,242 --> 02:55:49,651
MATT: Go for it.

2494
02:55:49,651 --> 02:55:59,178
TRAVIS: 33 minus five is 28?

2495
02:55:59,178 --> 02:56:04,265
MATT: That hits. You don't add the extra d8, since
you only get that when you throw it.

2496
02:56:04,265 --> 02:56:15,793
TRAVIS: Right. Shit, wait. Yeah. 26.

2497
02:56:15,793 --> 02:56:18,134
MATT: 26 damage.

2498
02:56:18,134 --> 02:56:21,207
TRAVIS: No, I'm sorry, the second hit was 26 to
hit.

2499
02:56:21,207 --> 02:56:22,873
MATT: Oh, I see. What was the damage on the first
one?

2500
02:56:22,873 --> 02:56:24,666
TRAVIS: I didn't do it yet.

2501
02:56:24,666 --> 02:56:26,090
MATT: Oh, okay.

2502
02:56:26,090 --> 02:56:29,254
TRAVIS: Now I've done it. What the fuck is that?

2503
02:56:29,254 --> 02:56:31,899
MATT: Welcome to d8s, motherfucker.

2504
02:56:31,899 --> 02:56:38,021
TRAVIS: I know. That's a six, plus-- I'm raging,
so 20 points of damage.

2505
02:56:38,021 --> 02:56:43,693
MATT: Okay. You slam across the side of the skull.
It slams against the side of the wall where you

2506
02:56:43,693 --> 02:56:46,905
hit it, and as it rights itself, you go with your
second attack, which does hit. Roll damage for

2507
02:56:46,905 --> 02:56:47,921
that one.

2508
02:56:47,921 --> 02:56:51,126
MARISHA: What the fuck is that? It's a number.

2509
02:56:51,126 --> 02:56:52,412
TRAVIS: 19.

2510
02:56:52,412 --> 02:56:59,097
MATT: 19 hits. Or 19 damage, sorry. Whack! You
slam it again. This time it falls to the ground

2511
02:56:59,097 --> 02:57:03,373
and picks itself back up, the flames brightening
once again, the anger as its jaw clacks open,

2512
02:57:03,373 --> 02:57:05,559
coming towards your face.

2513
02:57:05,559 --> 02:57:08,478
MARISHA: It's still alive? Kill it!

2514
02:57:08,478 --> 02:57:10,557
TRAVIS: I don't have a third attack.

2515
02:57:10,557 --> 02:57:11,924
MATT: Yeah, he's not frenzied.

2516
02:57:11,924 --> 02:57:19,021
TRAVIS: With a bonus action, can I attempt to use
my Boots of Feral Leaping and leap...

2517
02:57:19,021 --> 02:57:22,936
(laughter)

2518
02:57:22,936 --> 02:57:26,461
TRAVIS: To the wall towards you. (yelps)

2519
02:57:26,461 --> 02:57:30,988
TALIESIN: He senses the all-powerful deity to the
outside of it and just leaps towards Matt's face.

2520
02:57:30,988 --> 02:57:34,508
TRAVIS: Damn you, watcher of all things!

2521
02:57:34,508 --> 02:57:40,113
MATT: I'll just grab your mini and slam it into
the ground. No saves.

2522
02:57:40,113 --> 02:57:43,436
TRAVIS: Flatline. Not like this.

2523
02:57:43,436 --> 02:57:46,842
MATT: Not like this.

2524
02:57:46,842 --> 02:57:49,556
TRAVIS: I just want to leap towards the wall that
way so I'm not in the same line.

2525
02:57:49,556 --> 02:57:54,128
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make your athletics
check. Since you are raging,

2526
02:57:54,128 --> 02:57:55,307
you have advantage on it.

2527
02:57:55,307 --> 02:57:57,733
TRAVIS: Oh, cool. I don't need it, it's 26.

2528
02:57:57,733 --> 02:58:00,799
MATT: Okay, so you-- there you go.

2529
02:58:00,799 --> 02:58:04,353
TRAVIS: I expected you to die!

2530
02:58:04,353 --> 02:58:14,670
MATT: All right, this is Allura's turn. She sees,
currently at the moment, that the heavily damaged

2531
02:58:14,670 --> 02:58:20,580
flame skull, and there's nothing else in the
immediate vicinity. She glances past, steps over

2532
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:25,893
past Kerrek, and says, "Shall you, or shall I?"

2533
02:58:25,893 --> 02:58:30,184
PATRICK: Be my guest.

2534
02:58:30,184 --> 02:58:35,790
MATT: "You're too kind." And with one hand on your
shoulder and her staff in the other, she thrusts

2535
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:44,580
it forward, and you watch as four what looks like
small beads of arcane energy go rocketing out from

2536
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:50,735
the top of the staff, and arcing around each
other, as they swell with power and force. All

2537
02:58:50,735 --> 02:59:03,559
slam multiple times into the side, the Magic
Missiles dealing five, ten, 15-- four fours in a

2538
02:59:03,559 --> 02:59:12,530
row-- 20. Four fours in a row. And that's not
quite enough to finish it.

2539
02:59:12,530 --> 02:59:16,853
LAURA: How is this ghost so strong?

2540
02:59:16,853 --> 02:59:23,350
MATT: It's taken 59 points of damage. You watch
as--

2541
02:59:23,350 --> 02:59:25,842
TRAVIS: I forgot to add ten.

2542
02:59:25,842 --> 02:59:29,397
MATT: To each roll? Well.

2543
02:59:29,397 --> 02:59:31,219
TRAVIS: I mean, you can add 20.

2544
02:59:31,219 --> 02:59:33,770
MATT: So we'll say, given that circumstance.

2545
02:59:33,770 --> 02:59:36,748
TRAVIS: Sorry.

2546
02:59:36,748 --> 02:59:41,896
MATT: It's okay. Given the fact that it literally
had one hit point left--

2547
02:59:41,896 --> 02:59:43,404
TRAVIS: She got it!

2548
02:59:43,404 --> 02:59:49,178
MATT: It had one hit point left! So as the four
missiles slam into the side of the skull, the

2549
02:59:49,178 --> 02:59:53,993
final one hits, and its jaw gets blown off as the
rest of the skull just turns to ash against

2550
02:59:53,993 --> 03:00:01,600
the stonework and slowly rests across the side,
the combat coming to an end in that moment.

2551
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:03,216
LAURA: Good times, guys!

2552
03:00:03,216 --> 03:00:07,325
TALIESIN: Every week. Every week for two years.
We've been playing this game for two years.

2553
03:00:07,325 --> 03:00:10,914
LIAM: It's gonna be amazing when we're level one
again, we'll go, I hit it for three points!

2554
03:00:10,914 --> 03:00:13,969
(cheering)

2555
03:00:13,969 --> 03:00:17,690
TRAVIS: We came from that way, right?

2556
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:18,889
MATT: You came from this way, yes.

2557
03:00:18,889 --> 03:00:20,115
TRAVIS: Can I run that way?

2558
03:00:20,115 --> 03:00:21,667
MATT: This way? Yeah.

2559
03:00:21,667 --> 03:00:23,350
LIAM: This is a death trap, Grog, what are you
doing?

2560
03:00:23,350 --> 03:00:25,362
MARISHA: Why are you running backwards?

2561
03:00:25,362 --> 03:00:27,218
TRAVIS: We came from the other way.

2562
03:00:27,218 --> 03:00:29,277
MATT: You went this way.

2563
03:00:29,277 --> 03:00:30,447
TRAVIS: I run the other way.

2564
03:00:30,447 --> 03:00:34,015
MATT: Okay, so Grog just goes bolting through,
past all of you guys,

2565
03:00:34,015 --> 03:00:35,787
into the currently unexplored--

2566
03:00:35,787 --> 03:00:39,366
LIAM: I start flying with him. Grog, Grog, Grog,
we don't know if everything has been fucked up,

2567
03:00:39,366 --> 03:00:41,000
will you just wait a second?

2568
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,405
LAURA: Check for traps, check for traps!

2569
03:00:42,405 --> 03:00:44,407
TRAVIS: (braking noises)

2570
03:00:44,407 --> 03:00:46,011
TALIESIN: At the edge of the map?

2571
03:00:46,011 --> 03:00:48,297
LIAM: Wow. You're learning.

2572
03:00:48,297 --> 03:00:54,831
MATT: You just caught him as he moved past the
partially collapsed part of the wall where the one

2573
03:00:54,831 --> 03:00:56,163
skull was trying to hide.

2574
03:00:56,163 --> 03:01:02,793
MARISHA: Pike. Do we have maybe like a group heal,
'cause I'm half hit points

2575
03:01:02,793 --> 03:01:07,434
after flaming Night Riders.

2576
03:01:07,434 --> 03:01:08,952
LAURA: Yeah.

2577
03:01:08,952 --> 03:01:14,051
LIAM: I'm gonna check for traps past where the
gate was. 20 or 30 feet.

2578
03:01:14,051 --> 03:01:16,767
LAURA: Some sort of healing thing.

2579
03:01:16,767 --> 03:01:18,450
TRAVIS: How many of those did you fail?

2580
03:01:18,450 --> 03:01:21,389
MARISHA: I passed all of them, one with a nat 20.

2581
03:01:21,389 --> 03:01:23,645
TRAVIS: Oh. You're at half your hit points?

2582
03:01:23,645 --> 03:01:27,086
MARISHA: Look, man, we can't all be Grog the
barbarian.

2583
03:01:27,086 --> 03:01:35,103
LAURA: Do we wanna-- okay, if we all keep charging
in, that spell that we just did lasts for a

2584
03:01:35,103 --> 03:01:43,016
minute. Thought Raishan was around. She was not.
So, we've got less than a minute left on that

2585
03:01:43,016 --> 03:01:44,165
level eight there.

2586
03:01:44,165 --> 03:01:47,486
MARISHA: That gives us advantage on all saving
throws?

2587
03:01:47,486 --> 03:01:52,168
MATT: Which, actually, now that I think about it,
I need you to roll four concentration checks on

2588
03:01:52,168 --> 03:01:56,047
that one for Pike. So four constitution saving
throws.

2589
03:01:56,047 --> 03:01:59,876
LAURA: You know what, they did a good job of
keeping us from all dying just then, though.

2590
03:01:59,876 --> 03:02:03,781
LIAM: Yes, they did, yes, that was not wasted
advantage. Here we go.

2591
03:02:03,781 --> 03:02:11,273
LAURA: Natural 20, 18, 19, 11. 11.

2592
03:02:11,273 --> 03:02:13,531
PATRICK: Actually, that 11 had plus three.

2593
03:02:13,531 --> 03:02:22,797
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so she maintains concentration,
but you have roughly 50 seconds, 45 seconds.

2594
03:02:22,797 --> 03:02:25,111
LIAM: Let's go right now, right now.

2595
03:02:25,111 --> 03:02:27,231
LAURA: We're not gonna be able to get to her in a
minute, y'all.

2596
03:02:27,231 --> 03:02:28,990
LIAM: Is there anything ahead of me as I look with
my 19?

2597
03:02:28,990 --> 03:02:31,474
MATT: Okay, so as they're having this
conversation, you push past, you don't notice

2598
03:02:31,474 --> 03:02:39,105
anything trapped, but about 30 feet from where the
iron door was, as you're scoping, the floor just

2599
03:02:39,105 --> 03:02:43,994
turns to darkness, and as you peek over, you see
now a set of stairs are descending.

2600
03:02:43,994 --> 03:02:46,433
LIAM: But no traps?

2601
03:02:46,433 --> 03:02:48,322
MATT: No traps.

2602
03:02:48,322 --> 03:02:50,895
LIAM: Do we want to keep moving, or do we want to
pause?

2603
03:02:50,895 --> 03:02:53,880
LAURA: If we take a rest, we can rest up and
heal.

2604
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:56,194
PATRICK: I would like to have a short rest right
now so we can top off.

2605
03:02:56,194 --> 03:02:59,364
LIAM: Okay. Let the spell go, then. Hit dice.

2606
03:02:59,364 --> 03:03:03,730
LAURA: Okay, yeah. We use our hit dice, 'cause we
all got half of them back.

2607
03:03:03,730 --> 03:03:06,545
MARISHA: How long, short rest?

2608
03:03:06,545 --> 03:03:10,004
MATT: Short rest is about anywhere from 30 minutes
to an hour.

2609
03:03:10,004 --> 03:03:14,971
LAURA: We can scry and see if Raishan totally
knows that we're here.

2610
03:03:14,971 --> 03:03:20,712
PATRICK: Unless there's some sort of big healing
mojo, but I am really gimped.

2611
03:03:20,712 --> 03:03:25,071
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's just use our hit dice, save
the big heals.

2612
03:03:25,071 --> 03:03:27,244
MARISHA: I mean, I could burn a Mass Cure Wounds
and heal us.

2613
03:03:27,244 --> 03:03:29,519
TRAVIS: We haven't even fought the dragon yet.

2614
03:03:29,519 --> 03:03:30,926
LAURA: Yeah, that's the thing.

2615
03:03:30,926 --> 03:03:34,075
LIAM: For all we know, we fucked ourselves with
that skull earlier.

2616
03:03:34,075 --> 03:03:36,785
TALIESIN: So it wouldn't matter. So what's 40
minutes.

2617
03:03:36,785 --> 03:03:39,509
MARISHA: I don't know, I feel like that was gonna
happen.

2618
03:03:39,509 --> 03:03:41,741
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're good. Let's take a--

2619
03:03:41,741 --> 03:03:44,980
MARISHA: She's a smart woman. The least that we
can assume is that she knows.

2620
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:46,605
LIAM: We haven't outsmarted her yet.

2621
03:03:46,605 --> 03:03:48,154
LAURA: She's probably already bamfed out, y'all.

2622
03:03:48,154 --> 03:03:50,434
TALIESIN: You can find out really easily.

2623
03:03:50,434 --> 03:03:55,178
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, while we're resting, I'm gonna
detect dragons and see if she's still around.

2624
03:03:55,178 --> 03:04:02,379
MATT: Okay. You sense the same three dragon
presences in the vicinity.

2625
03:04:02,379 --> 03:04:07,593
LAURA: Same spot? Oh, all right.

2626
03:04:07,593 --> 03:04:11,310
MARISHA: That's something.

2627
03:04:11,310 --> 03:04:14,446
LIAM: (whispers) Tell us all your secrets.

2628
03:04:14,446 --> 03:04:19,037
TRAVIS: Nine times a day, playa.

2629
03:04:19,037 --> 03:04:23,084
MATT: Don't forget, you guys using your hit dice,
you get Scanlan's Song of Rest.

2630
03:04:23,084 --> 03:04:25,161
LAURA: Okay, so what is that?

2631
03:04:25,161 --> 03:04:27,582
MATT: It's an additional d12.

2632
03:04:27,582 --> 03:04:30,507
MARISHA: Song of Rest is 1d12 healing points.

2633
03:04:30,507 --> 03:04:32,649
TALIESIN: On top of?

2634
03:04:32,649 --> 03:04:35,571
MATT: On top of whatever you healed, you then get
an additional d12.

2635
03:04:35,571 --> 03:04:37,674
TRAVIS: I got a 12 right there, that's fucking
sweet.

2636
03:04:37,674 --> 03:04:47,353
MARISHA: Plus 12? Plus 1d8 plus? Sorry. Plus 1d12,
right? He adds a 1d12.

2637
03:04:47,353 --> 03:04:50,279
TALIESIN: Nine.

2638
03:04:50,279 --> 03:04:55,818
MATT: That's overall, not on each dice, yeah. Just
overall.

2639
03:04:55,818 --> 03:04:58,314
MARISHA: Hit dice.

2640
03:04:58,314 --> 03:05:07,844
TRAVIS: Do we go back up to Heroes' Feast hit
points, or not anymore?

2641
03:05:07,844 --> 03:05:11,610
MATT: Yeah. Heroes' Feast is addition to your
maximum hit points.

2642
03:05:11,610 --> 03:05:14,111
TRAVIS: I heal 55 hit points with this d12
monster.

2643
03:05:14,111 --> 03:05:15,698
LAURA: Oh my god, I rolled so good.

2644
03:05:15,698 --> 03:05:19,186
TRAVIS: I'm just one below where I was.

2645
03:05:19,186 --> 03:05:20,557
MATT: Which is what?

2646
03:05:20,557 --> 03:05:21,924
TRAVIS: 235.

2647
03:05:21,924 --> 03:05:23,575
MATT: 235 for Grog. Percy, where are you at?

2648
03:05:23,575 --> 03:05:24,946
TALIESIN: I'm still rolling.

2649
03:05:24,946 --> 03:05:32,789
LAURA: I went all the way back to my maximum, so
115 is what I'm at now.

2650
03:05:32,789 --> 03:05:35,776
MATT: Okay. Vax, you didn't take any damage.
Kerrek, what are you at?

2651
03:05:35,776 --> 03:05:37,571
PATRICK: Still rolling.

2652
03:05:37,571 --> 03:05:38,925
MATT: Okay, no worries.

2653
03:05:38,925 --> 03:05:48,562
TALIESIN: I'm rolling really shittily.

2654
03:05:48,562 --> 03:05:51,187
MARISHA: I'm not doing great.

2655
03:05:51,187 --> 03:05:52,550
LIAM: Scanlan helped out with that?

2656
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:53,970
MATT: He did, yeah.

2657
03:05:53,970 --> 03:06:03,812
LIAM: (sings) When the Blight has come, and the
land is dark, and your health is down to 23 HP.

2658
03:06:03,812 --> 03:06:07,359
TRAVIS: Oh, you're doing great! That's great.

2659
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:10,098
LAURA: That was good.

2660
03:06:10,098 --> 03:06:12,370
TRAVIS: We're missing the high soprano tonal
quality.

2661
03:06:12,370 --> 03:06:13,997
LIAM: Can't do it, can't do it.

2662
03:06:13,997 --> 03:06:15,718
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm down a lot.

2663
03:06:15,718 --> 03:06:20,236
MARISHA: I'm gonna burn my last few hit dice.

2664
03:06:20,236 --> 03:06:25,147
TALIESIN: I'm at 140, I'm not at the top of my
peak.

2665
03:06:25,147 --> 03:06:27,007
MARISHA: I'm at 95.

2666
03:06:27,007 --> 03:06:28,393
MATT: 95, got it.

2667
03:06:28,393 --> 03:06:33,912
TALIESIN: Is it possible-- god, I have
instructions on how to run Scanlan, and I'm

2668
03:06:33,912 --> 03:06:35,558
debating how to best do that.

2669
03:06:35,558 --> 03:06:39,888
LAURA: Oh, I went up to 117, because I forgot I
had the extra 15.

2670
03:06:39,888 --> 03:06:43,108
MATT: Heroes' Feast, yeah.

2671
03:06:43,108 --> 03:06:47,772
LIAM: Is he going to do a bump or a thing?

2672
03:06:47,772 --> 03:06:50,640
MARISHA: Would he do a bump right now? He probably
would, wouldn't he?

2673
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,820
TALIESIN: I was going to say, according to the
instructions I was given--

2674
03:06:52,820 --> 03:06:54,171
MARISHA: Probably.

2675
03:06:54,171 --> 03:06:57,837
LAURA: Pike's back at 115.

2676
03:06:57,837 --> 03:07:01,495
TALIESIN: Well, that's the thing, I want to make
sure I can do this in a way so I don't take

2677
03:07:01,495 --> 03:07:03,548
anything from him later.

2678
03:07:03,548 --> 03:07:08,795
MARISHA: Is he-- wait, hang on, wait, I feel like
he texted. No, he didn't.

2679
03:07:08,795 --> 03:07:13,148
TALIESIN: He really-- yeah, no, I'm gonna try--

2680
03:07:13,148 --> 03:07:15,117
TRAVIS: A number, give him a number.

2681
03:07:15,117 --> 03:07:17,553
MARISHA: Hang on. How many bumps of suude does he
have left?

2682
03:07:17,553 --> 03:07:18,559
MATT: One.

2683
03:07:18,559 --> 03:07:20,038
TRAVIS: Save it.

2684
03:07:20,038 --> 03:07:23,258
MARISHA: Would he do it for after Raishan or
before?

2685
03:07:23,258 --> 03:07:24,302
TRAVIS: After.

2686
03:07:24,302 --> 03:07:25,561
TALIESIN: Before.

2687
03:07:25,561 --> 03:07:28,465
LIAM: Before, I think, too.

2688
03:07:28,465 --> 03:07:31,164
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was given specific
instructions.

2689
03:07:31,164 --> 03:07:33,401
MARISHA: I think he would do it before, too.

2690
03:07:33,401 --> 03:07:38,005
TALIESIN: He's gonna push a little forward, up to
the stairs, get away from the rest of the group.

2691
03:07:38,208 --> 03:07:41,335
MATT: That'll be going up to where Vax is.

2692
03:07:41,335 --> 03:07:44,272
TALIESIN: Oh, then he's going to push a little far
back and just--

2693
03:07:44,272 --> 03:07:46,092
MATT: Okay, so Scanlan backs away.

2694
03:07:46,092 --> 03:07:48,685
LAURA: Wait, Scanlan gave us an extra nine hit
points?

2695
03:07:48,685 --> 03:07:49,766
MATT: Extra d12.

2696
03:07:49,766 --> 03:07:51,790
TALIESIN: Which is nine hit points.

2697
03:07:51,790 --> 03:07:59,596
LAURA: Nine. I'm higher than 117, then I'm
one-whatever. 126.

2698
03:07:59,596 --> 03:08:01,813
MARISHA: So he has one hit of suude left?

2699
03:08:01,813 --> 03:08:06,382
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's gonna get himself quietly
away. I think he's had it packed already, so

2700
03:08:06,382 --> 03:08:08,460
there's not gonna be a big, elaborate-- he's just
gonna--

2701
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:11,025
MARISHA: Holy shit, this feels so weird.

2702
03:08:11,025 --> 03:08:15,946
MATT: To by-proxy do this? Yeah. Okay.

2703
03:08:15,946 --> 03:08:17,733
MARISHA: It feels so dirty.

2704
03:08:17,733 --> 03:08:19,800
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution saving
throw.

2705
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:25,940
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna sully it with my good
dice, I'm gonna use one of my crappy dice.

2706
03:08:25,940 --> 03:08:28,100
MARISHA: He gave us instructions.

2707
03:08:28,100 --> 03:08:31,683
TALIESIN: This is, I guess, the most stoner die I
have for this.

2708
03:08:31,683 --> 03:08:37,718
So okay, constitution saving throw?

2709
03:08:37,718 --> 03:08:40,140
MARISHA: Come on. Just straight constitution?

2710
03:08:40,140 --> 03:08:42,680
TALIESIN: 19. Oh, saving throw. 19.

2711
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:52,927
MATT: 19, all right, great. As Scanlan takes the
flute and takes in the fumes of the char-burned

2712
03:08:52,927 --> 03:09:03,020
suude, the familiar burn and chemical flavor fills
his lungs, and as he exhales, this fine brown

2713
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:09,792
smoke emits from his lungs, and his vision
clarifies suddenly, and he feels this elevated

2714
03:09:09,792 --> 03:09:18,308
sense of energy and power in his mind. For the
next hour, Scanlan has one sorcery point that he

2715
03:09:18,308 --> 03:09:26,291
can spend as the sorcerer metamagic class, and has
access to the extended spell Metamagic ability.

2716
03:09:26,291 --> 03:09:29,476
LIAM: Do you know what that means? I kind of do.

2717
03:09:29,476 --> 03:09:34,275
MARISHA: Okay, unextended spell Metamagic? So what
does that buy us?

2718
03:09:34,275 --> 03:09:38,965
MATT: So he has one point, period, that he can
ever spend for the next hour.

2719
03:09:38,965 --> 03:09:40,532
MARISHA: He has one sorcery point.

2720
03:09:40,532 --> 03:09:41,735
MATT: Correct.

2721
03:09:41,735 --> 03:09:46,599
MARISHA: Wait, how do you spell sorcery? How do
you spell sorcery?

2722
03:09:46,599 --> 03:09:57,021
MATT: And basically, he can spend it to double the
duration of a spell as he casts it.

2723
03:09:57,021 --> 03:09:59,217
MARISHA: He can double--

2724
03:09:59,217 --> 03:10:01,935
LIAM: That's the only thing that's within reach of
one sorcery point, right?

2725
03:10:01,935 --> 03:10:09,086
MATT: That's-- the suude gives him access to a
specific metamagic based on the color of the

2726
03:10:09,086 --> 03:10:14,485
suude, and he gets a point. The more you use to
get more points, the higher the DC gets, and the

2727
03:10:14,485 --> 03:10:16,429
closer you get to overdosing.

2728
03:10:16,429 --> 03:10:19,438
TALIESIN: Ah, I love it! This is the worst thing
ever!

2729
03:10:19,438 --> 03:10:21,258
MARISHA: So he could theoretically die by doing
this.

2730
03:10:21,258 --> 03:10:23,497
LIAM: Hey, man, it's just another version of
Craven Edge.

2731
03:10:23,497 --> 03:10:26,857
TALIESIN: No, it's great, yeah. This is weirdly--

2732
03:10:26,857 --> 03:10:29,055
TRAVIS: Yeah, except I had it all under control.

2733
03:10:29,055 --> 03:10:30,306
LAURA: Sure.

2734
03:10:30,306 --> 03:10:33,912
MARISHA: So wait, he can double the length of one
spell.

2735
03:10:33,912 --> 03:10:39,841
MATT: Yeah, a single spell that has a duration, he
can use that sorcery point to double the duration

2736
03:10:39,841 --> 03:10:40,959
of that spell.

2737
03:10:40,959 --> 03:10:42,465
MARISHA: The duration of one spell.

2738
03:10:42,465 --> 03:10:43,300
MATT: Correct.

2739
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:45,372
MARISHA: And it could be-- wait, question.

2740
03:10:45,372 --> 03:10:48,017
MATT: So if it's one minute concentration, it can
be two minutes concentration.

2741
03:10:48,017 --> 03:10:50,630
MARISHA: What if it's one action? Could it be two
actions? He could do it back to back?

2742
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:56,179
MATT: No. The duration, not the casting time.
Those are different. The duration is once you cast

2743
03:10:56,179 --> 03:10:57,949
it, how long it lasts before it expires.

2744
03:10:57,949 --> 03:11:03,107
LAURA: So like a mansion we could have for two
days.

2745
03:11:03,107 --> 03:11:05,081
TALIESIN: Two-day mansion!

2746
03:11:05,081 --> 03:11:13,148
MATT: Actually, no, it says specifically as part
of the metamagic ability that it has a maximum of

2747
03:11:13,148 --> 03:11:16,612
24 hours. So if it already has a 24 hour duration,
you cannot.

2748
03:11:16,612 --> 03:11:18,323
LAURA: Just kidding.

2749
03:11:18,323 --> 03:11:20,879
MARISHA: So only if it's below 24 hours.

2750
03:11:20,879 --> 03:11:24,205
TALIESIN: The large print giveth and the small
print taketh away.

2751
03:11:24,205 --> 03:11:28,092
(laughter)

2752
03:11:28,092 --> 03:11:29,552
MATT: That's a beautiful quote.

2753
03:11:29,552 --> 03:11:32,497
TALIESIN: Tom Waits, everybody. Tom Waits, bless
him.

2754
03:11:32,497 --> 03:11:35,378
LIAM: (Tom Waits voice) What's Percy building in
there?

2755
03:11:35,378 --> 03:11:38,769
TRAVIS: Patrick, how much did you heal, brother?

2756
03:11:38,769 --> 03:11:41,400
PATRICK: I'm up to 94.

2757
03:11:41,400 --> 03:11:42,860
MATT: All righty.

2758
03:11:42,860 --> 03:11:44,678
TALIESIN: I dig this. We got this.

2759
03:11:44,678 --> 03:11:50,271
MARISHA: One sorcery, double, okay. All right, all
right. Holy shit.

2760
03:11:50,271 --> 03:11:55,659
LIAM: I found nothing in the further area, right?

2761
03:11:55,659 --> 03:11:59,754
MATT: No traps. You came to the edge of the stairs
that lead down for about 20 or so feet, and then

2762
03:11:59,754 --> 03:12:05,924
progress an even path, and then disappear below
what your visual is able to see from above.

2763
03:12:05,924 --> 03:12:09,242
MARISHA: Keyleth is going to just, before this
short rest, is going to

2764
03:12:09,242 --> 03:12:11,031
give one Cure Wounds to herself.

2765
03:12:11,031 --> 03:12:12,543
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2766
03:12:12,543 --> 03:12:13,899
MARISHA: Just to top me off.

2767
03:12:13,899 --> 03:12:15,856
LIAM: Kerr, is your hammer still aglow?

2768
03:12:15,856 --> 03:12:19,231
PATRICK: If you want light, I can do light.

2769
03:12:19,231 --> 03:12:22,383
LIAM: I wanna know if it's aglow right now. Did
you have a chance to pop it out?

2770
03:12:22,383 --> 03:12:26,067
PATRICK: It probably is unless somebody told me to
turn it off.

2771
03:12:26,067 --> 03:12:29,812
LIAM: Okay. So I figured it was probably still
on.

2772
03:12:29,812 --> 03:12:33,023
MATT: Yeah, it's still currently being the central
source of light in this room.

2773
03:12:33,023 --> 03:12:35,378
LIAM: How far down the stairs do I see from where
I am?

2774
03:12:35,378 --> 03:12:41,149
MATT: From where you are, you can see all the way
to the bottom of the 20 feet of stairs, but the

2775
03:12:41,149 --> 03:12:45,692
roof of the tunnel cuts off the rest of the path,
so you have to go out further

2776
03:12:45,692 --> 03:12:47,350
to look out where it goes.

2777
03:12:47,350 --> 03:12:49,519
MARISHA: Keyleth is at 116 hit points.

2778
03:12:49,519 --> 03:12:50,726
MATT: Cool, got it.

2779
03:12:50,726 --> 03:12:52,358
LIAM: Put that out, please, Kerr?

2780
03:12:52,358 --> 03:12:53,759
PATRICK: Okay, I snuff it.

2781
03:12:53,759 --> 03:12:58,675
LIAM: I'm gonna go stealth, and I'm gonna go down
to the bottom of the steps. And I've already

2782
03:12:58,675 --> 03:13:03,157
checked for traps-- oh no, I didn't, up to this
point, so I'm gonna check for traps as I go down

2783
03:13:03,157 --> 03:13:03,975
the steps.

2784
03:13:03,975 --> 03:13:05,566
MATT: Okay, stealth first.

2785
03:13:05,566 --> 03:13:08,871
LIAM: Which is 25. Am I still under Pass Without a
Trace?

2786
03:13:08,871 --> 03:13:10,300
MATT: No, because she cast--

2787
03:13:10,300 --> 03:13:11,233
LIAM: 25.

2788
03:13:11,233 --> 03:13:13,920
MATT: 25, okay. And then make an investigation
check.

2789
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:15,303
LIAM: Natural 20 for that.

2790
03:13:15,303 --> 03:13:24,173
MATT: You make your way down the stairs into the
next bit of the hallway. No traps. The stonework

2791
03:13:24,173 --> 03:13:32,602
here now is getting a little more refined the
further you go, and as you look out the hallway,

2792
03:13:32,602 --> 03:13:41,836
you have another 25, 30 feet of this 20-foot-wide,
20-foot-tall hallway before it seems to just end

2793
03:13:41,836 --> 03:13:47,187
and drop off. And you can see what looks to be the
gap in another wall

2794
03:13:47,187 --> 03:13:49,257
about 25 feet across from that.

2795
03:13:49,257 --> 03:13:55,758
LIAM: Okay. So hallway goes a ways, then there's
nothing, and then 20 feet past that--

2796
03:13:55,758 --> 03:13:58,330
MATT: And then just a wall on the other side.

2797
03:13:58,330 --> 03:14:00,531
LIAM: So a gap and then a wall?

2798
03:14:00,531 --> 03:14:03,686
MATT: Yeah, looks like it goes down or up. You'd
have to get closer to get more detail.

2799
03:14:03,686 --> 03:14:06,913
TALIESIN: I keep meaning to build something for
something like this. I just haven't had the time.

2800
03:14:06,913 --> 03:14:10,712
LAURA: Oh, you know what, darling, don't worry.
You can use the carpet.

2801
03:14:10,712 --> 03:14:20,061
LIAM: On the earring: team, there's a passage down
ahead of me. There's no traps, I don't think.

2802
03:14:20,061 --> 03:14:21,452
LAURA: So let's walk up there.

2803
03:14:21,452 --> 03:14:26,760
LIAM: Yeah, catch up with me and then pause, and
then either I or my sister and I will move ahead?

2804
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:31,854
TALIESIN: And just let us know which direction you
think we should head, Vex.

2805
03:14:31,854 --> 03:14:35,410
LAURA: Of course.

2806
03:14:35,410 --> 03:14:39,740
LIAM: Did you mean Vax or did you mean Vex? Just
want to be really sure. Because people make

2807
03:14:39,740 --> 03:14:41,159
mistakes a lot.

2808
03:14:41,159 --> 03:14:42,285
LAURA: They do, they really do.

2809
03:14:42,285 --> 03:14:45,448
TALIESIN: I do, I know I do. That wasn't a
mistake, though.

2810
03:14:45,659 --> 03:14:46,435
LIAM: Very similar.

2811
03:14:46,435 --> 03:14:47,596
TALIESIN: Love you madly.

2812
03:14:47,596 --> 03:14:49,409
LIAM: All right. I know you're talking to Vax.

2813
03:14:49,409 --> 03:14:51,165
TALIESIN: That was for Vex. Vax. Which one?

2814
03:14:51,165 --> 03:14:53,494
MATT: Trinket can use his own hit dice to heal, if
you wanted to.

2815
03:14:53,494 --> 03:14:59,485
LAURA: Okay, then he healed himself while we were
rested, but he's in the necklace so that we can

2816
03:14:59,485 --> 03:15:01,105
fly if we have to.

2817
03:15:01,105 --> 03:15:05,344
MATT: That's fine. Okay, so yeah, you can go ahead
and heal him up. Vax, you move ahead?

2818
03:15:05,344 --> 03:15:06,307
LIAM: Yeah.

2819
03:15:06,307 --> 03:15:09,133
MATT: Okay, as they start catching up with you,
you hear them stepping down the stairs behind you,

2820
03:15:09,133 --> 03:15:15,302
you come up to the edge, and now what you see is a
25-foot circular almost cylinder. There is a

2821
03:15:15,302 --> 03:15:20,766
ceiling maybe about five feet above you, and
nothing there, but what you do see is about a

2822
03:15:20,766 --> 03:15:29,471
three-foot-wide spiral staircase that just leads
down and down and down. And you cannot see where

2823
03:15:29,471 --> 03:15:30,888
it ends at the bottom.

2824
03:15:30,888 --> 03:15:36,234
LIAM: Is it a staircase where I'm forced to walk,
or is it stairs on the walls and empty space down

2825
03:15:36,234 --> 03:15:37,422
the center of it?

2826
03:15:37,422 --> 03:15:41,396
MATT: Empty space down the center of it, and it's
just a two-and-a-half- or three-foot-wide

2827
03:15:41,396 --> 03:15:44,547
staircase that goes along the edge, and that's all
you have to walk on.

2828
03:15:44,547 --> 03:15:49,567
LIAM: Ah. I'm going to float out above it and look
for traps down the cylinder.

2829
03:15:49,567 --> 03:15:51,103
MATT: Okay.

2830
03:15:51,103 --> 03:15:54,974
TALIESIN: Why don't you tie the endless rope to
yourself so we can pull you up--

2831
03:15:54,974 --> 03:15:56,807
LIAM: I've got wings.

2832
03:15:56,807 --> 03:16:00,515
LAURA: But they're only out for an hour, dear.

2833
03:16:00,515 --> 03:16:01,704
LIAM: 18.

2834
03:16:01,704 --> 03:16:10,428
MATT: 18, okay. As you slowly drift down, keeping
your wings, you hover further down, maybe

2835
03:16:10,428 --> 03:16:14,240
incrementally ten feet at a time, looking around,
looking at the stairs. You don't notice anything

2836
03:16:14,240 --> 03:16:19,918
trapped. It all seems pretty standard. The stones
are old, they're a little smooth at the edges,

2837
03:16:19,918 --> 03:16:27,599
what were once kind of very, very rigid and square
protrusions from the stone seemingly have a little

2838
03:16:27,599 --> 03:16:28,776
rubbed off.

2839
03:16:28,776 --> 03:16:31,182
LIAM: At or near the bottom, doorway, passage?

2840
03:16:31,182 --> 03:16:37,563
MATT: As you get closer to the bottom, and as you
get about roughly 100 feet down before you

2841
03:16:37,563 --> 03:16:42,737
actually reach the bottom, but you begin to see
below you, there are, right in the center of the

2842
03:16:42,737 --> 03:16:55,912
spiral downward, a cluster of four-foot-long kind
of deep brown or maroon-colored iron spikes that

2843
03:16:55,912 --> 03:17:05,578
are all just jutting upward in slightly off-kilter
directions, and there is a very, very heavy pile

2844
03:17:05,578 --> 03:17:11,602
of splintered bones and long-mummified dead
corpses that are currently just piled up at the

2845
03:17:11,602 --> 03:17:17,449
base of these spikes, some still impaled, many of
which have slowly rotted and fallen apart.

2846
03:17:17,449 --> 03:17:23,533
LIAM: Over the earring, I didn't see any traps
going down, but there's some bloody spikes down

2847
03:17:23,533 --> 03:17:30,754
here and some dead things, so Vex, dear, could you
load everyone onto the carpet and get on your

2848
03:17:30,754 --> 03:17:35,051
broom and go down and just float down to the
center and leave the stairs alone?

2849
03:17:35,051 --> 03:17:39,490
LAURA: Of course. The carpet can fit everybody.

2850
03:17:39,490 --> 03:17:47,159
MATT: The carpet can carry 600 pounds. That's
roughly four people, or a Grog. 800 pounds.

2851
03:17:47,159 --> 03:17:49,605
LAURA: Grog and one person.

2852
03:17:49,605 --> 03:17:52,074
TRAVIS: I'm more than 450, so.

2853
03:17:52,074 --> 03:17:53,890
MATT: Grog and maybe two people.

2854
03:17:53,890 --> 03:17:56,173
LAURA: So I can get Scanlan--

2855
03:17:56,173 --> 03:17:59,241
MATT: You currently have ten people traveling with
you.

2856
03:17:59,241 --> 03:18:03,668
TALIESIN: So here's an interesting thing. We don't
have an immovable bar anymore, we left those both

2857
03:18:03,668 --> 03:18:08,422
outside. All right, that's fine. Let's--

2858
03:18:08,422 --> 03:18:11,905
LAURA: What's at the bottom of the stairs? I mean,
can we drop people off and go back in?

2859
03:18:11,905 --> 03:18:15,912
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can come up for Pike,
bring her down, we could just take a minute to--

2860
03:18:15,912 --> 03:18:18,569
TALIESIN: We could shuttle or use a rope.

2861
03:18:18,569 --> 03:18:20,992
LAURA: Let's shuttle-bus.

2862
03:18:20,992 --> 03:18:26,276
LIAM: And what around the spikes, is there a safe
portion on the floor?

2863
03:18:26,276 --> 03:18:27,975
LAURA: A safe landing?

2864
03:18:27,975 --> 03:18:34,213
MATT: There is a very, very-- kind of where the
outer trim is of the stairway, the stonework

2865
03:18:34,213 --> 03:18:40,676
travels around it, and then underneath the
stairway there is a small opening that leads into

2866
03:18:40,676 --> 03:18:42,073
a further passageway.

2867
03:18:42,073 --> 03:18:44,519
LAURA: Is it safe to walk into the passageway?

2868
03:18:44,519 --> 03:18:46,734
TRAVIS: Pretty sure we should just take the
stairs.

2869
03:18:46,734 --> 03:18:50,408
LAURA: Pretty sure we should just use the brazier
and light it.

2870
03:18:50,408 --> 03:18:52,911
TALIESIN: I will avoid cardio at all costs.

2871
03:18:52,911 --> 03:18:56,040
LIAM: 22 investigating for traps for that passage
down behind the spikes.

2872
03:18:56,040 --> 03:18:59,669
MATT: Okay. I mean, just glancing around the
archway, it's not a closed doorway, just an

2873
03:18:59,669 --> 03:19:04,492
archway, and then a dark tunnel beyond that, it
does not appear to be trapped.

2874
03:19:04,492 --> 03:19:09,728
LIAM: All right. Best I can tell, it's okay. I'm
not 100% sure, but there's dead people down here,

2875
03:19:09,728 --> 03:19:11,876
so I just want you guys to float down the middle,
let's get this done.

2876
03:19:11,876 --> 03:19:13,174
TALIESIN: Grog first?

2877
03:19:13,174 --> 03:19:15,271
LIAM: 'kay.

2878
03:19:15,271 --> 03:19:17,983
TRAVIS: I'm game.

2879
03:19:17,983 --> 03:19:21,203
LAURA: I'm gonna grab Scanlan on the broom. You
grab Pike.

2880
03:19:21,203 --> 03:19:22,517
LIAM: I'm shooting up, yeah.

2881
03:19:22,517 --> 03:19:26,463
LAURA: Okay, and then we'll take the gnomes and
Grog down and then come back up.

2882
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:29,093
LIAM: I kinda wanna move as fast as we can.

2883
03:19:29,093 --> 03:19:34,952
MATT: Okay, so who's doing what? Okay, you guys
just threw a bunch of stuff at me right now.

2884
03:19:34,952 --> 03:19:36,090
LIAM: I flew back up.

2885
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:37,319
MATT: You flew back up.

2886
03:19:37,319 --> 03:19:38,484
LIAM: We take the gnomes down.

2887
03:19:38,484 --> 03:19:42,986
LAURA: Yeah, I've got-- I want Pike on my broom.

2888
03:19:42,986 --> 03:19:48,094
LIAM: I take my little drug-addled buddy, not that
I know that, and I float him down, and I plant the

2889
03:19:48,094 --> 03:19:49,836
gnomes down together.

2890
03:19:49,836 --> 03:19:56,101
MATT: Okay, so you have Scanlan, you have Pike.
Okay. You guys enter the center area and begin

2891
03:19:56,101 --> 03:20:04,163
coasting downward. You notice a faint blue glow
above you in the ceiling. As you glance up, you

2892
03:20:04,163 --> 03:20:07,257
watch as a glyph begins to slowly--

2893
03:20:07,257 --> 03:20:08,986
TALIESIN: Dispel Magic.

2894
03:20:08,986 --> 03:20:16,075
MATT: Dispel Magic from Scanlan right now? Okay,
have Scanlan go ahead and roll an ability check.

2895
03:20:16,075 --> 03:20:20,824
TALIESIN: Ability check? Okay, I will admit, I
have no idea what I'm doing.

2896
03:20:20,824 --> 03:20:25,149
MATT: For this, 'cause he can't cast as a
reaction, and this would technically be your

2897
03:20:25,149 --> 03:20:29,254
reaction, as it's already been triggered, I wanna
have you go ahead and roll an initiative check.

2898
03:20:29,254 --> 03:20:31,038
MARISHA: Is this a spell attack bonus?

2899
03:20:31,038 --> 03:20:32,219
MATT: Huh?

2900
03:20:32,219 --> 03:20:35,287
MARISHA: What? What ability check?

2901
03:20:35,287 --> 03:20:40,992
MATT: This would be a charisma, plus six and plus
two. It's plus eight to whatever you roll, but

2902
03:20:40,992 --> 03:20:47,018
first, I need you to go ahead and roll initiative.
Technically you would not be able to do this as

2903
03:20:47,018 --> 03:20:48,576
it's not really a reaction.

2904
03:20:48,576 --> 03:20:50,937
MARISHA: His charisma plus his proficiency bonus.

2905
03:20:50,937 --> 03:20:59,319
MATT: Not for the ability check on Dispel Magic.
19? That's 17. So yes. Go ahead and roll a d20 and

2906
03:20:59,319 --> 03:21:00,506
add eight.

2907
03:21:00,506 --> 03:21:06,596
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

2908
03:21:06,596 --> 03:21:08,940
TALIESIN: 21.

2909
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:14,884
MATT: 21, okay. As he streaks upward and releases
the spell, you watch as the glyph that was

2910
03:21:14,884 --> 03:21:16,319
glowing--

2911
03:21:16,319 --> 03:21:25,627
TALIESIN: (sings) Rock glyph! You don't have to
turn on the blue light. Rock glyph! You don't have

2912
03:21:25,627 --> 03:21:32,250
to give our bodies to the spikes. Love you, Sam.
Love you.

2913
03:21:32,250 --> 03:21:34,144
TRAVIS: That was good!

2914
03:21:34,144 --> 03:21:38,956
MARISHA: That was good, get some Police up in
here.

2915
03:21:38,956 --> 03:21:44,831
TALIESIN: Brought it all the way back for you.

2916
03:21:44,831 --> 03:21:50,966
MATT: So. You guys manage to continue all the way
downward, flying, you place both of the gnomes at

2917
03:21:50,966 --> 03:21:52,990
the base, safely by the spikes.

2918
03:21:52,990 --> 03:21:58,065
LIAM: Oh man, I plant him down, I give him a big
fat kiss right between the eyes, you fucking

2919
03:21:58,065 --> 03:21:59,664
beautiful bastard! Whack!

2920
03:21:59,664 --> 03:22:01,702
LAURA: What was that? What was that? Sam?
Scanlan?

2921
03:22:01,702 --> 03:22:03,604
TALIESIN: I have no idea. It just looked
dangerous, and I figured

2922
03:22:03,604 --> 03:22:05,511
that's better safe than sorry.

2923
03:22:05,511 --> 03:22:07,764
LAURA: Do you think it's broken now? Can we get
other people from--

2924
03:22:07,764 --> 03:22:09,191
TALIESIN: Sure, they'll be fine.

2925
03:22:09,191 --> 03:22:15,083
LIAM: I fly back up right away. Keep this train
moving.

2926
03:22:15,083 --> 03:22:17,644
TRAVIS: On the carpet? I'm ready?

2927
03:22:17,644 --> 03:22:19,091
LIAM: I bring Kima down.

2928
03:22:19,091 --> 03:22:21,738
LAURA: Grog and Allura can fit on the carpet,
right?

2929
03:22:21,738 --> 03:22:24,278
TRAVIS: Just me, I think.

2930
03:22:24,278 --> 03:22:26,189
LIAM: She's wafer-thin.

2931
03:22:26,189 --> 03:22:33,088
TRAVIS: What do you think? Me and Allura, or just
me?

2932
03:22:33,088 --> 03:22:34,925
MATT: You and one other person could probably get
on.

2933
03:22:34,925 --> 03:22:39,858
LAURA: Okay, then, oh god. Maybe, could you take, 
when you fly back up--

2934
03:22:39,858 --> 03:22:42,357
TALIESIN: I'll go with you, 'cause I'm fine. So I
have options.

2935
03:22:42,704 --> 03:22:45,154
LIAM: Is Kima down?

2936
03:22:45,154 --> 03:22:48,165
MATT: You go ahead and begin to carry Kima down
without an issue, yeah.

2937
03:22:48,165 --> 03:22:54,582
LAURA: Okay, I go back up and get Percy. We have
Kerr and Allura and Keyleth left.

2938
03:22:54,582 --> 03:22:56,077
LIAM: Allura.

2939
03:22:56,077 --> 03:22:58,386
MATT: Okay, so you grab Allura, bring her down
below.

2940
03:22:58,386 --> 03:23:00,103
LIAM: I hope this is all right.

2941
03:23:00,103 --> 03:23:03,246
LAURA: I grab Percy on the broom and come down.

2942
03:23:03,246 --> 03:23:06,262
TRAVIS: Who else is left up top?

2943
03:23:06,262 --> 03:23:11,413
LAURA: I feel like-- wait, I pause before we go
down the stairs, 'cause I'm like, there was this

2944
03:23:11,413 --> 03:23:14,815
blue light that happened before, and Scanlan made
it stop.

2945
03:23:14,815 --> 03:23:16,224
TALIESIN: Oh no, we saw.

2946
03:23:16,224 --> 03:23:20,535
LAURA: How do we not let that happen this time?

2947
03:23:20,535 --> 03:23:23,728
TALIESIN: Did we make it down and nothing
happened?

2948
03:23:23,728 --> 03:23:26,783
MATT: Most of you made it down. Kerrek has not
come down--

2949
03:23:26,783 --> 03:23:30,482
MARISHA: Who hasn't made it down? Have I made it
down?

2950
03:23:30,482 --> 03:23:32,199
MATT: Keyleth hasn't made it down yet.

2951
03:23:32,199 --> 03:23:34,500
LAURA: I thought you already went down on the
carpet. No?

2952
03:23:34,500 --> 03:23:38,931
MATT: Grog hasn't made it yet. So you've carried
everybody but Grog, Kerrek, and Keyleth.

2953
03:23:38,931 --> 03:23:40,000
LAURA: Okay.

2954
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:45,922
LIAM: I mean, whatever the time is needed. Go up,
grab Keyleth, bring her down, go up--

2955
03:23:45,922 --> 03:23:48,521
MARISHA: What's going on with the blue light?

2956
03:23:48,521 --> 03:23:50,758
MATT: It doesn't seem to be having an effect right
now.

2957
03:23:50,758 --> 03:23:52,796
LIAM: I just grabbed up Kerrek.

2958
03:23:52,796 --> 03:23:56,805
LAURA: You can carry Kerrek?

2959
03:23:56,805 --> 03:23:59,107
MATT: Kerrek's pretty heavy. I need you to make a
strength check.

2960
03:23:59,107 --> 03:24:04,122
LIAM: (laughs) Best one ever. 21.

2961
03:24:04,122 --> 03:24:09,458
LAURA: You're so strong! Oh my god! You've been
lifting, bro!

2962
03:24:09,458 --> 03:24:16,484
MATT: It's a bit of a strain with the weight of
his armor and getting up in his years, versus your

2963
03:24:16,484 --> 03:24:22,089
tiny half-elf frame, but you do manage to bring
him down without issue.

2964
03:24:22,089 --> 03:24:24,360
LIAM: (strained) The Raven Queen sends her
regards.

2965
03:24:24,360 --> 03:24:26,605
LAURA: Grog.

2966
03:24:26,605 --> 03:24:28,619
PATRICK: I'm getting to hug all the boys in this
adventure.

2967
03:24:28,619 --> 03:24:30,534
(laughter)

2968
03:24:30,534 --> 03:24:32,346
PATRICK: This is Kerrek's best day ever.

2969
03:24:32,346 --> 03:24:41,398
TALIESIN: Somebody's got a coupon for a back
massage. Welcome to Vox Machina. You seem tense.

2970
03:24:41,398 --> 03:24:43,086
MARISHA: That's what we pay you in.

2971
03:24:43,086 --> 03:24:48,871
LIAM: I'm sure we just killed ten minutes doing
all that shit.

2972
03:24:48,871 --> 03:24:51,867
LAURA: Groggy, can you come down?

2973
03:24:51,867 --> 03:24:53,897
TRAVIS: Is it just me and Keyleth?

2974
03:24:53,897 --> 03:24:58,551
MATT: Yeah, it's just the two of you up there. No,
he brought Keyleth down. So it's just you.

2975
03:24:58,551 --> 03:25:05,086
TRAVIS: Okay. First, I stand on the carpet. I say,
lift!

2976
03:25:05,086 --> 03:25:09,889
MATT: The carpet takes you off the ground. You
have to kinda get your--

2977
03:25:09,889 --> 03:25:16,738
TRAVIS: No, I lay down flat. And I grab the edges
of the carpet, and I go, okay!

2978
03:25:16,738 --> 03:25:18,311
And try to go down.

2979
03:25:18,311 --> 03:25:24,163
MATT: Okay. You go into a pseudo-nosedive. It's
thrilling and scary at the same moment, and as

2980
03:25:24,163 --> 03:25:26,254
you're going up, Grog just goes past you.

2981
03:25:26,254 --> 03:25:28,885
TRAVIS: Stop, stop, stop!

2982
03:25:28,885 --> 03:25:33,511
MATT: And it just barely coasts past the spikes
and lets you fine on the side.

2983
03:25:33,511 --> 03:25:39,702
TALIESIN: It's about the speed of the children's
rides at Fantasyland at Disneyland, right?

2984
03:25:39,702 --> 03:25:45,856
MATT: Yeah, it's not super fast. Magic carpet can
go about as fast as a person, especially this

2985
03:25:45,856 --> 03:25:49,982
size. The smaller they are, the faster they are.
This is a very big one, but not very fast.

2986
03:25:49,982 --> 03:25:55,126
LIAM: All right. Vax does a barrel roll, heads
back down, lands, and let's start looking around

2987
03:25:55,126 --> 03:26:01,508
again. All right, stealth, traps, still vigilant.

2988
03:26:01,508 --> 03:26:02,845
MATT: Indeed.

2989
03:26:02,845 --> 03:26:13,814
LIAM: For stealth, that's a 28, and investigating
for traps, ooh, that's a one, and I'm not gonna

2990
03:26:13,814 --> 03:26:15,382
use my Luck on it.

2991
03:26:15,382 --> 03:26:16,867
MATT: All righty.

2992
03:26:16,867 --> 03:26:21,790
LIAM: I'm not. Seems clear. We're good. I am
badass.

2993
03:26:21,790 --> 03:26:28,522
MATT: So, as you guys have reached the bottom of
this cylindrical chamber, you follow suit, one by

2994
03:26:28,528 --> 03:26:31,941
one, which by the way, just so I know going
forward, what's the marching order right now?

2995
03:26:31,941 --> 03:26:34,798
LIAM: Vax in the front.

2996
03:26:34,798 --> 03:26:36,963
PATRICK: I'm by Grog.

2997
03:26:36,963 --> 03:26:39,225
(laughter)

2998
03:26:39,225 --> 03:26:40,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby!

2999
03:26:40,540 --> 03:26:42,186
MATT: Grog, where are you at?

3000
03:26:42,186 --> 03:26:43,511
TRAVIS: I'll be behind the twins.

3001
03:26:43,511 --> 03:26:49,865
MARISHA: I'll be behind Grog. Kerr, with Grog.

3002
03:26:49,865 --> 03:26:52,195
MATT: Percy, where are you at?

3003
03:26:52,195 --> 03:27:00,349
TALIESIN: I think probably, maybe Scanlan and Pike
are in front of me, and then I'm probably hanging

3004
03:27:00,349 --> 03:27:04,560
back with Kima and Allura, just sort of ready to--
I want to be at a distance.

3005
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:06,114
LAURA: And Trinket's--

3006
03:27:06,114 --> 03:27:08,553
MATT: Trinket is out now?

3007
03:27:08,553 --> 03:27:13,443
LAURA: Trinket's still in my necklace. He's
healing in the necklace.

3008
03:27:13,443 --> 03:27:17,997
MATT: Okay. So, moving forward, following Vax's
lead--

3009
03:27:17,997 --> 03:27:27,107
LAURA: I'm just gonna stay on the broom and just
kind of very close to the ground, but not touching

3010
03:27:27,107 --> 03:27:28,111
the ground.

3011
03:27:28,111 --> 03:27:38,755
MATT: Okay. So the hallway's probably 20 feet wide
and 15 feet tall, as you push forward. The walls

3012
03:27:38,755 --> 03:27:45,005
are chiseled rather roughly, and about 30 feet
forward ahead of you, you can see it ends at a

3013
03:27:45,005 --> 03:27:51,342
cross-section of what looks like a very deep
ravine, both above and below. There is an

3014
03:27:51,342 --> 03:27:56,195
underground chasm here that stretches both to the
right and left, though you'd have to get to the

3015
03:27:56,195 --> 03:28:02,643
very edge to kind of see how far it goes. It's
about 60 feet across to the other side, and you

3016
03:28:02,643 --> 03:28:08,736
can see what looks to be another entranceway to
another hallway, and there is a taut rope bridge

3017
03:28:08,736 --> 03:28:11,691
bolted to each side leading across.

3018
03:28:11,691 --> 03:28:13,261
TRAVIS: We should just use that.

3019
03:28:13,261 --> 03:28:14,686
LAURA: Totally.

3020
03:28:14,686 --> 03:28:16,692
MARISHA: That looks safe.

3021
03:28:16,692 --> 03:28:19,945
LIAM: Jeez, we just blew so much time on that
fucking stairwell.

3022
03:28:19,945 --> 03:28:23,414
MARISHA: Guys, in Latin, Jehovah starts with an
'i'.

3023
03:28:23,414 --> 03:28:27,837
LAURA: It's a leap of faith!

3024
03:28:27,837 --> 03:28:31,314
LIAM: Should've sent you to the Marx brothers.

3025
03:28:31,314 --> 03:28:36,452
TALIESIN: When he said 'chiseled rather roughly',
he meant Brad Pitt.

3026
03:28:36,452 --> 03:28:40,526
LAURA: How long until your wings stop working?

3027
03:28:40,526 --> 03:28:42,491
LIAM: I don't know. Ten or 15, I guess?

3028
03:28:42,491 --> 03:28:43,935
LAURA: Zoinks.

3029
03:28:44,080 --> 03:28:45,370
LIAM: Zoinks.

3030
03:28:45,370 --> 03:28:48,463
MATT: Your wings went out before the battle and
you took a long rest, your wings are pretty much

3031
03:28:48,463 --> 03:28:51,184
done now. 30 minutes to an hour.

3032
03:28:51,184 --> 03:28:53,380
LIAM: Yeah, I thought we were cutting it close,
like it could be

3033
03:28:53,380 --> 03:28:55,391
five or ten minutes at this point.

3034
03:28:55,391 --> 03:28:59,505
MATT: Between riding everyone up and down, I'm
letting you know, right now, Mr. Already Flying

3035
03:28:59,505 --> 03:29:01,912
Everywhere, your wings are about expended.

3036
03:29:01,912 --> 03:29:04,012
LIAM: All right. Should I stand on the ground?

3037
03:29:04,012 --> 03:29:07,293
MATT: That's up to you. Do you want to keep flying
until they're gone, or do you want to sit there?

3038
03:29:07,293 --> 03:29:09,909
LIAM: I'm gonna fly to the other side of the
bridge right now.

3039
03:29:09,909 --> 03:29:10,883
MATT: Okay.

3040
03:29:10,883 --> 03:29:13,062
LAURA: I'm gonna go with him. On my broom.

3041
03:29:13,062 --> 03:29:21,649
MATT: Okay. So. You get about five feet out before
the wings go (fsh).

3042
03:29:21,649 --> 03:29:23,875
LIAM: Over nothing?

3043
03:29:23,875 --> 03:29:28,791
MATT: Looking down, you see darkness, and there's
a few stalagtites that--

3044
03:29:28,791 --> 03:29:35,937
LIAM: I throw a dagger at the other side of the
chasm, 60 feet, sharpshooter, into the side near

3045
03:29:35,937 --> 03:29:37,697
the top. Whisper.

3046
03:29:37,697 --> 03:29:40,209
LAURA: This is why I went on the broom, I was
gonna catch you.

3047
03:29:40,209 --> 03:29:44,741
LIAM: As an attack?

3048
03:29:44,741 --> 03:29:48,885
MATT: You're attacking just the wall above, or--

3049
03:29:48,885 --> 03:29:55,798
LIAM: There's a cliff facing me, right? Yeah, just
into the rock wall of the cliff. 20.

3050
03:29:55,798 --> 03:30:04,297
MATT: 20, okay. The dagger hits the edge, and you
appear right at the edge of the cliff. You're

3051
03:30:04,297 --> 03:30:07,004
gonna try to reach and grab. Make a dexterity
saving throw.

3052
03:30:07,004 --> 03:30:09,850
LIAM: 22.

3053
03:30:09,850 --> 03:30:12,520
MATT: Okay, so you grab and get up on the
other side.

3054
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:17,129
LAURA: Jesus! Small heart attack over here.

3055
03:30:17,129 --> 03:30:25,161
MATT: You didn't even really fall for a moment.
Vex, you're floating across, and it feels strange,

3056
03:30:25,161 --> 03:30:34,797
going across. There's no wind, but the broom is
acting extremely wobbly, and the way you control

3057
03:30:34,797 --> 03:30:43,551
it and maneuver around, you feel almost drunk, but
you're not. This is not acting properly.

3058
03:30:43,551 --> 03:30:45,392
LAURA: I'm gonna turn around and go back to the--

3059
03:30:45,392 --> 03:30:47,160
MATT: Okay, so you head back?

3060
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:51,355
LAURA: That was weird. It doesn't feel right.

3061
03:30:51,355 --> 03:30:56,175
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to grab on to the
bridge, I'm going to test it, I'm going to step to

3062
03:30:56,175 --> 03:30:57,906
see if it's real. I'm checking it.

3063
03:30:57,906 --> 03:31:07,344
MATT: Okay. You take your hands there, holding,
and you put your foot out onto the wood, and it's

3064
03:31:07,344 --> 03:31:08,960
sturdy. It's strong.

3065
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:11,437
TRAVIS: (laughs) You bastard.

3066
03:31:11,437 --> 03:31:19,954
MARISHA: I go up to the edge of the rope bridge
that Percy's now standing on. I lean down and on

3067
03:31:19,954 --> 03:31:28,277
the dirt I cast Druidcraft. Can I craft some vines
to help reinforce the bridge?

3068
03:31:28,277 --> 03:31:35,366
MATT: With Druidcraft, you can create some small
vines that wrap around it, and it might help in

3069
03:31:35,366 --> 03:31:38,379
some regard, but not a lot. Druidcraft is a very
limited cantrip.

3070
03:31:38,379 --> 03:31:45,614
TALIESIN: I'm gonna grab one end of the infinite
rope, and I'm gonna hand the other end of the

3071
03:31:45,614 --> 03:31:52,749
infinite rope to someone who's staying. I think
that I pose a good chance of getting across this

3072
03:31:52,749 --> 03:31:57,524
safely. I'm going to make a run for it. Well, not
a run.

3073
03:31:57,524 --> 03:31:59,244
TRAVIS: Are you literally going to run?

3074
03:31:59,244 --> 03:32:01,066
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to walk. Gingerly.

3075
03:32:01,066 --> 03:32:02,798
TRAVIS: Oh. So you're gonna make a walk for it.

3076
03:32:02,798 --> 03:32:08,435
TALIESIN: I'm tying the rope-- That may be one of
the smartest things you've ever said. I don't

3077
03:32:08,435 --> 03:32:10,646
actually have a retort for it on any level.

3078
03:32:10,646 --> 03:32:14,803
TRAVIS: I don't know why-- what is 'retort'?
Okay.

3079
03:32:14,803 --> 03:32:21,709
TALIESIN: It means if I die, you win. I'm going to
tie the infinite rope to myself and hand it off to

3080
03:32:21,709 --> 03:32:28,912
Grog. Oh god. I'm handing it to Grog. And I'm
going to start gingerly stepping out onto the

3081
03:32:28,912 --> 03:32:34,120
bridge, being very careful, and checking with each
step that's it's real, and looking for weird

3082
03:32:34,120 --> 03:32:37,280
glyphs or signs or anything out of the ordinary.

3083
03:32:37,280 --> 03:32:41,301
LAURA: Percy? Be careful.

3084
03:32:41,301 --> 03:32:42,769
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

3085
03:32:42,769 --> 03:32:47,518
MARISHA: As this happens, Scanlan sings, hey
Percy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my

3086
03:32:47,518 --> 03:32:53,356
mind, hey Percy! Hey Percy! Hey Percy, you're so
fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, with your

3087
03:32:53,356 --> 03:32:58,495
gun! With your gun! And then he gets a point of
inspiration.

3088
03:32:58,495 --> 03:33:01,861
MATT: All right, so you get your d12 inspiration
die.

3089
03:33:01,861 --> 03:33:03,544
TRAVIS: Marisha, that was really nice.

3090
03:33:03,544 --> 03:33:07,497
MARISHA: Thank you. I feel like I had the same
witty repartee as Sam Riegel.

3091
03:33:07,497 --> 03:33:13,738
LIAM: Okay, okay, now just smile and make the
smile as big as Manhattan.

3092
03:33:13,738 --> 03:33:15,374
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

3093
03:33:15,374 --> 03:33:25,527
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's 22.

3094
03:33:25,527 --> 03:33:32,229
MATT: That's really good. All right, so as you
start stepping out, you feel this shift in the

3095
03:33:32,229 --> 03:33:34,206
space, and you grab on to the edges of the--

3096
03:33:34,206 --> 03:33:39,295
TALIESIN: I'm also using my boots, and I'm gluing
them to whatever the-- yeah.

3097
03:33:39,295 --> 03:33:44,167
MATT: Right. And as you glue the boots there,
that's really what solidifies you in place, and

3098
03:33:44,167 --> 03:33:46,024
you're still there, on the bridge, without a
problem.

3099
03:33:46,024 --> 03:33:48,767
TALIESIN: Are things just getting weird out here?

3100
03:33:48,767 --> 03:33:53,797
MATT: It feels weird. You can't quite understand
what's transpiring, but it just feels weird.

3101
03:33:53,797 --> 03:33:59,657
LAURA: Allura. It felt like almost I was drunk as
I was flying across that. Do you know--

3102
03:33:59,657 --> 03:34:03,377
MATT: "I don't think it's drunk, per se, it's just
that you're not used to flying in that direction."

3103
03:34:03,377 --> 03:34:07,630
And she points out towards the ravine, and you
watch as Percy, who's kind of holding onto the

3104
03:34:07,630 --> 03:34:11,776
ravine, feet solid, his hair is just up.

3105
03:34:11,776 --> 03:34:14,117
LIAM: Gravity is fucked.

3106
03:34:14,117 --> 03:34:20,062
TALIESIN: Well, this will be fine. Is gravity
flipped?

3107
03:34:20,062 --> 03:34:22,837
MATT: As you hear this conversation, it seems that
way, yeah.

3108
03:34:22,837 --> 03:34:29,447
TALIESIN: I'm going to spider-climb. I'm just
going to use my spider-climb boots, and I'm going

3109
03:34:29,447 --> 03:34:31,506
to make my way, with the rope.

3110
03:34:31,506 --> 03:34:39,197
MATT: You do so. Make it across the way. The wood
shivers a little bit, shifts beneath your feet,

3111
03:34:39,197 --> 03:34:42,469
being pulled upward from your weight. You guys
watch as the bridge that was once taut is now

3112
03:34:42,469 --> 03:34:46,715
arcing up and following Percy as he moves across,
his weight pulling it upward.

3113
03:34:46,715 --> 03:34:48,770
MARISHA: That's cool.

3114
03:34:48,770 --> 03:34:53,988
LAURA: So can I try flying out there, knowing the
gravity's shifted? Does it feel okay to fly out

3115
03:34:53,988 --> 03:34:54,990
like that?

3116
03:34:55,147 --> 03:35:00,378
MATT: As you fly out and spin yourself
underneath-- yes, you do actually manage to fly,

3117
03:35:00,378 --> 03:35:05,720
essentially barrel roll across, and manage to make
it across to your brother without an issue.

3118
03:35:05,720 --> 03:35:08,510
LAURA: Oh, I didn't want to go all the way across,
I just wanted to test it so I could help bring

3119
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:09,894
other people across.

3120
03:35:09,894 --> 03:35:15,181
TALIESIN: We've got now a third rope, we can
literally just clip people to the rope, now.

3121
03:35:15,181 --> 03:35:20,373
LIAM: It was like pole-dancing, but in space?
Upside-down?

3122
03:35:20,373 --> 03:35:27,594
TALIESIN: We can use the rope we just made as a
clipped rappel rope, can we? That's a thing that

3123
03:35:27,594 --> 03:35:28,833
we can do.

3124
03:35:28,833 --> 03:35:31,514
LAURA: Potentially?

3125
03:35:31,514 --> 03:35:37,608
TALIESIN: If everybody wants to try and cross, we
can actually-- we now have an unencumbered piece

3126
03:35:37,608 --> 03:35:40,295
that we can use to get people across.

3127
03:35:40,295 --> 03:35:43,877
TRAVIS: I'm gonna jump.

3128
03:35:43,877 --> 03:35:52,225
LIAM: No, no, that's a bad idea, Grog. You are
very hefty and the gravity turns upside-down.

3129
03:35:52,225 --> 03:35:53,892
TALIESIN: There's probably spikes up there.

3130
03:35:53,892 --> 03:35:56,059
LAURA: Grog, did you see how I barrel-rolled on my
broom?

3131
03:35:56,059 --> 03:35:57,489
TRAVIS: Yeah, do I twist in the air?

3132
03:35:57,489 --> 03:35:59,694
LAURA: Yeah, you should just do the same thing on
the carpet.

3133
03:35:59,694 --> 03:36:05,859
LIAM: Wait, what if he took the carpet and hung
off the bottom of it on the first side and then as

3134
03:36:05,859 --> 03:36:08,525
he made his way over, he'd be all right. You know
what I mean?

3135
03:36:08,525 --> 03:36:09,777
LAURA: I don't know.

3136
03:36:09,777 --> 03:36:15,413
MATT: Vex, Vax, and Keyleth, as you guys are
having this conversation, something catches the

3137
03:36:15,413 --> 03:36:20,329
corner of your eye, and you watch something just
go (tss), just whizz past from the bottom of the

3138
03:36:20,329 --> 03:36:21,648
ravine to the top.

3139
03:36:21,648 --> 03:36:23,440
LIAM: We saw that. We saw that.

3140
03:36:23,440 --> 03:36:24,970
MATT: You saw something quickly just go by.

3141
03:36:24,970 --> 03:36:27,501
LAURA: Can I get a better look, can I look and see
if I see it again?

3142
03:36:27,501 --> 03:36:30,445
MATT: Yeah, the three of you guys make a
perception check as you kind of come up to the

3143
03:36:30,445 --> 03:36:31,790
edge and look.

3144
03:36:31,790 --> 03:36:33,609
LIAM: 26.

3145
03:36:33,609 --> 03:36:35,250
MARISHA: 14.

3146
03:36:35,250 --> 03:36:36,773
LAURA: Is this related to dragons?

3147
03:36:36,773 --> 03:36:38,827
MATT: This is not related to dragons.

3148
03:36:38,827 --> 03:36:45,574
LAURA: Then that is a 21.

3149
03:36:45,574 --> 03:36:46,900
LIAM: 26.

3150
03:36:46,900 --> 03:36:56,924
MATT: All right. So you're seeing little things,
just right out of the middle of the light, you can

3151
03:36:56,924 --> 03:37:03,494
see something shifting above and below you. You
guys have a little better view. You still can't

3152
03:37:03,494 --> 03:37:09,827
quite see-- the length of your Darkvision is too
far for you to see what is below you or

3153
03:37:09,827 --> 03:37:11,202
necessarily what's above--

3154
03:37:11,202 --> 03:37:13,868
MARISHA: Can I, as a quick reaction, grab the rope
bridge?

3155
03:37:13,868 --> 03:37:20,358
MATT: Yeah. So you're still off to the side, just
holding onto the bridge? Okay. You are beginning

3156
03:37:20,358 --> 03:37:30,062
to watch what looks to be figures. Humanoid
bodies.

3157
03:37:30,062 --> 03:37:31,927
TALIESIN: Oh, I have a theory.

3158
03:37:31,927 --> 03:37:37,651
MATT: Just tumbling past. One of them hits the
edge of the bridge and it keeps spinning off as it

3159
03:37:37,651 --> 03:37:39,189
disappears into the darkness above.

3160
03:37:39,189 --> 03:37:42,612
TALIESIN: I have a weird theory. I'm going to
grab-- what do I have that I can do this with?

3161
03:37:42,612 --> 03:37:46,175
LIAM: But they look like spirits falling upwards?

3162
03:37:46,175 --> 03:37:55,954
MATT: You watch a couple more go by, and they are
nearly skeletal bodies falling upward. But, as you

3163
03:37:55,954 --> 03:38:03,407
watch a couple more go by, they're limp, somewhat,
but still moving as they scoot past.

3164
03:38:03,407 --> 03:38:07,346
LAURA: Let's just get across here, shall we?

3165
03:38:07,346 --> 03:38:10,543
LIAM: I'm going to use Divine Sense, now. Just to
confirm.

3166
03:38:10,543 --> 03:38:15,837
MATT: You wait about a minute or so before one
comes close enough to hit the sense, but there is

3167
03:38:15,837 --> 03:38:22,735
an undead energy that passes past, and both you
and Kerr have this moment from across the ravine

3168
03:38:22,735 --> 03:38:25,181
from each other, seeing this.

3169
03:38:25,181 --> 03:38:28,499
PATRICK: Gonna throw up the horns.

3170
03:38:28,499 --> 03:38:31,991
LIAM: That's me to you, man.

3171
03:38:31,991 --> 03:38:36,367
TALIESIN: Try and clock them, see if it's the same
bodies over and over again. If it's an infinite

3172
03:38:36,367 --> 03:38:37,679
loop of falling.

3173
03:38:37,679 --> 03:38:39,642
MARISHA: An infinite loop of falling?

3174
03:38:39,642 --> 03:38:43,393
LAURA: Okay, so I wanna get a good look at one of
them as they go by.

3175
03:38:43,393 --> 03:38:44,888
LIAM: Oh, it's a gif.

3176
03:38:44,888 --> 03:38:45,973
MARISHA: Six seconds.

3177
03:38:45,973 --> 03:38:55,007
MATT: Three or four more stumble past, and they're
getting more and more rapid. And they're different

3178
03:38:55,007 --> 03:38:59,156
sizes, they do not appear to be the same bodies.

3179
03:38:59,156 --> 03:39:03,304
LAURA: I pick up Pike and try to barrel roll
across.

3180
03:39:03,304 --> 03:39:09,732
MATT: Okay. Barrel roll across. As you're making
it across, three more come tumbling up, two of

3181
03:39:09,732 --> 03:39:14,868
them too far away, but one of them does reach out
with its arms as it tumbles past you, and swats

3182
03:39:14,868 --> 03:39:19,944
out to try and grab you. I need you to make an
acrobatics check.

3183
03:39:19,944 --> 03:39:28,402
LIAM: You got this. Oh, you got such a bonus. Come
on, girl!

3184
03:39:28,402 --> 03:39:34,884
TRAVIS: Such a bonus, huh? Such a bonus. Look at
Matt's face. Look at his face.

3185
03:39:34,884 --> 03:39:37,257
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck no.

3186
03:39:37,257 --> 03:39:41,148
MARISHA: Oh, come on. No, come on.

3187
03:39:41,148 --> 03:39:43,527
LIAM: Do they both make that roll?

3188
03:39:43,527 --> 03:39:46,738
MATT: She's the one driving the broom. She's
having to try and maneuver.

3189
03:39:46,738 --> 03:39:51,453
TALIESIN: I was about to interject, and I know
that I didn't make that fast enough, but at some

3190
03:39:51,453 --> 03:39:54,009
point I would already like to be moving to
interject in this.

3191
03:39:54,009 --> 03:39:58,929
MATT: Right, as you're watching them start going
across, you get a step out onto the bridge--

3192
03:39:58,929 --> 03:40:01,156
TALIESIN: I'm not going onto the bridge, I'm
pulling out my gun--

3193
03:40:01,156 --> 03:40:07,382
LAURA: Oh wait, Pike has a thing that she can help
people with their--

3194
03:40:07,382 --> 03:40:10,698
TRAVIS: War God's Blessing?

3195
03:40:10,698 --> 03:40:12,356
MATT: That's an attack roll.

3196
03:40:12,356 --> 03:40:13,538
LAURA: Damn it!

3197
03:40:13,538 --> 03:40:16,236
MATT: War gods don't help you survive, they help
you kill shit.

3198
03:40:16,236 --> 03:40:17,531
TRAVIS: Do what you're gonna do, Mercer.

3199
03:40:17,531 --> 03:40:19,926
TALIESIN: I was gonna start skeet-shooting at some
point, so.

3200
03:40:19,926 --> 03:40:29,419
MATT: Understood, but before we get to that. So
the creature grabs you and essentially grapples

3201
03:40:29,419 --> 03:40:36,297
you in the moment. As that happens, the momentum
of pulling you up causes the broom to shift out of

3202
03:40:36,297 --> 03:40:41,691
whack, and you begin to careen in a slight circle.
I need you and Pike

3203
03:40:41,691 --> 03:40:44,339
to both make strength saving throws.

3204
03:40:44,339 --> 03:40:47,975
PATRICK: How far away is this?

3205
03:40:47,975 --> 03:40:50,552
MATT: They're about 30 feet from you.

3206
03:40:50,552 --> 03:40:52,208
MARISHA: What about from Keyleth?

3207
03:40:52,208 --> 03:40:55,750
MATT: About the same, so you guys are on the other
side of the ravine.

3208
03:40:55,750 --> 03:41:06,190
LAURA: She's got a plus four on strength. Nine for
me.

3209
03:41:06,190 --> 03:41:08,544
LIAM: 13 for Pike.

3210
03:41:08,544 --> 03:41:25,702
MATT: So. Okay. So Pike's on the broom with you.
You get grabbed and yanked off the broom. Pike

3211
03:41:25,702 --> 03:41:30,930
manages to hold the broom, but currently Pike is
not the current driver of it, and so she's

3212
03:41:30,930 --> 03:41:37,945
clutching a broom that's just floating in the
gravity. You watch as both Pike and Vex go from

3213
03:41:37,945 --> 03:41:41,589
careening off to tumbling upward into the darkness
above.

3214
03:41:41,589 --> 03:41:43,181
MARISHA: Are they both attached to the broom?

3215
03:41:43,181 --> 03:41:44,546
MATT: No. Vex is pulled off the broom.

3216
03:41:44,546 --> 03:41:45,896
TALIESIN: But she's still tethered.

3217
03:41:45,896 --> 03:41:47,880
MATT: She's still tethered, yeah.

3218
03:41:47,880 --> 03:41:51,142
MARISHA: Does Keyleth have an action?

3219
03:41:51,142 --> 03:41:55,540
MATT: Right now, the two of you can both make an
action.

3220
03:41:55,540 --> 03:42:00,611
TALIESIN: All right, my first action, I was just
pulling to try and skeet-shoot and sharpshoot with

3221
03:42:00,611 --> 03:42:08,884
Bad News to hit the undead that had grappled her,
and I assume I have spend a grit to get him to let

3222
03:42:08,884 --> 03:42:10,475
go. To shove him off.

3223
03:42:10,475 --> 03:42:16,605
MATT: Because of the nature of the rapid movement,
you are at a disadvantage on this attack.

3224
03:42:16,605 --> 03:42:19,164
MARISHA: You still have the inspiration, right?

3225
03:42:19,164 --> 03:42:20,975
TALIESIN: I still have that d12 inspiration.

3226
03:42:20,975 --> 03:42:28,462
LIAM: Matt? Watching this, I'm going to pull
Whisper out and watch to see my sister falling

3227
03:42:28,462 --> 03:42:31,359
through the air, and if I see her falling, I'm
going to throw the dagger at her.

3228
03:42:31,359 --> 03:42:33,769
MATT: Okay. She's falling.

3229
03:42:33,769 --> 03:42:35,529
LIAM: Down or up?

3230
03:42:35,529 --> 03:42:36,770
MATT: Up.

3231
03:42:36,770 --> 03:42:41,335
LIAM: I'm watching him and I'm watching her, and
if she goes-- how far away is she from me?

3232
03:42:41,335 --> 03:42:48,053
MATT: Right now, she's about 30 feet out from the
ravine, and now tumbling upward, she's about 50

3233
03:42:48,053 --> 03:42:49,332
feet from you.

3234
03:42:49,332 --> 03:42:52,271
MARISHA: 'Cause he's on the other side, correct?

3235
03:42:52,271 --> 03:42:54,941
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake, really?

3236
03:42:54,941 --> 03:42:57,102
MATT: Misfire?

3237
03:42:57,102 --> 03:42:58,733
TALIESIN: Misfire.

3238
03:42:58,733 --> 03:43:03,360
MARISHA: All righty. Keyleth's gonna go. Seeing
Percy misfire, Keyleth is going to grab a Grasping

3239
03:43:03,360 --> 03:43:10,514
Vine on the side of the wall, and she's going to
go for that broom. 'Cause both Pike and her are

3240
03:43:10,514 --> 03:43:12,352
still grabbing onto that broom, yeah?

3241
03:43:12,352 --> 03:43:14,912
LIAM: And I'm throwing Whisper at Vex. I'm doing
it.

3242
03:43:14,912 --> 03:43:18,336
MATT: The vine, unfortunately, only has a range of
30 feet.

3243
03:43:18,336 --> 03:43:20,568
MARISHA: You said she was 30 feet away.

3244
03:43:20,568 --> 03:43:25,999
MATT: She's 30 feet out from the center of the
ravine and is now 15, 20 feet up in the air.

3245
03:43:25,999 --> 03:43:29,926
MARISHA: Can she not hit the wall, get a vine off
the side of the wall and bring her down?

3246
03:43:29,926 --> 03:43:31,662
MATT: The opposite side? Maybe.

3247
03:43:31,662 --> 03:43:37,748
MARISHA: I've got a 60-foot range to this spell,
plus 30 feet from the Grasping Vine, right? Or is

3248
03:43:37,748 --> 03:43:42,093
it 30 and 30? I thought you were still grabbing
onto the--

3249
03:43:42,093 --> 03:43:43,792
LAURA: I'm tethered to the broom.

3250
03:43:43,792 --> 03:43:50,457
MARISHA: To the broom, and Pike's still grabbing
onto the broom, yeah? I'm going for the broom.

3251
03:43:50,457 --> 03:43:54,537
Come on, man!

3252
03:43:54,537 --> 03:43:57,692
(laughter)

3253
03:43:57,692 --> 03:44:04,250
MATT: Look, I'm trying to work out-- you guys do a
lot of things really fast. I'm trying, I'm working

3254
03:44:04,250 --> 03:44:07,750
with you, so please bear with me on this.

3255
03:44:07,750 --> 03:44:11,540
MARISHA: Grasping Vine! What? What?

3256
03:44:11,540 --> 03:44:13,192
LIAM: You're like a loan officer.

3257
03:44:13,192 --> 03:44:15,364
MATT: I wouldn't recommend doing that or I won't
give you a chance to even do it.

3258
03:44:15,364 --> 03:44:16,854
Don't taunt the DM.

3259
03:44:16,854 --> 03:44:20,396
LIAM: I want to sell you this house, but there's
some shit we need to go over.

3260
03:44:20,396 --> 03:44:29,256
MATT: So. I'm going to ask you, Keyleth, to go
ahead and make just a general dexterity check.

3261
03:44:29,256 --> 03:44:34,437
MARISHA: Just general dex? What?

3262
03:44:34,437 --> 03:44:40,038
MATT: This is how fast you're able to enchant a
spell, which requires an incantation and the

3263
03:44:40,038 --> 03:44:44,833
release of the spell's effect, thus summoning the
vine and causing it to lash out. This is just a

3264
03:44:44,833 --> 03:44:49,365
general, base DC, I need you to go ahead and just
roll and add your dexterity modifier.

3265
03:44:49,365 --> 03:44:51,264
LAURA: You got it, you got it.

3266
03:44:51,264 --> 03:44:52,501
MARISHA: I love you.

3267
03:44:52,501 --> 03:44:53,652
LAURA: I love you.

3268
03:44:53,652 --> 03:45:01,470
MARISHA: That was a natural 19, so that is plus my
dex, which is plus two, so 21. Hah!

3269
03:45:01,470 --> 03:45:04,597
LAURA: Don't hah, don't hah the DM!

3270
03:45:04,597 --> 03:45:09,583
MARISHA: I mean, (yells, grunts).

3271
03:45:09,583 --> 03:45:17,733
MATT: So, as Bad News misfires, you watch as the
front of it just, this burst of black smoke bursts

3272
03:45:17,733 --> 03:45:23,693
outward, and this look of utter horror on Percy's
face. Keyleth rushes out, and grabbing the edge of

3273
03:45:23,693 --> 03:45:28,722
the rope bridge to get enough of a reach out
there, you watch as her hair lifts up and part of

3274
03:45:28,722 --> 03:45:33,641
her body begins to just drift upward, but she
holds on and reaches out with the staff, and,

3275
03:45:33,641 --> 03:45:39,530
using the strength of her force of will, the edge
of the stone above the ravine cracks open and

3276
03:45:39,530 --> 03:45:45,780
suddenly you watch where there is no life, a
piercing flash of dark green shoots outward, a

3277
03:45:45,780 --> 03:45:50,889
vine freshly grown from the edge of the stonework
reaches out and grabs, wrapping around the broom

3278
03:45:50,889 --> 03:45:56,715
itself and holding it taut. You watch as the vine
and the entire group shifts upward. You're

3279
03:45:56,715 --> 03:46:02,861
suddenly pulled, you're still grappled by this
undead zombie-like corpse, and Pike is currently

3280
03:46:02,861 --> 03:46:09,912
clutching onto the broom as hard as she can as you
both impact at the end. With your weight and the

3281
03:46:09,912 --> 03:46:11,887
creature's weight, I now get to see if the--

3282
03:46:11,887 --> 03:46:13,370
LAURA: Vine holds?

3283
03:46:13,370 --> 03:46:17,960
MATT: Well, not the vine. The vine magically
holds. It's the chain that attaches you to the

3284
03:46:17,960 --> 03:46:25,687
broom. Yeah, okay. So that holds. It goes taut,
you're held there. The creature's still clutching

3285
03:46:25,687 --> 03:46:26,858
you right now.

3286
03:46:26,858 --> 03:46:28,368
LAURA: Are my arms restrained?

3287
03:46:28,368 --> 03:46:34,505
MATT: Your arms are held to, yeah. Actually,
'cause you're still held there, I want you to go

3288
03:46:34,505 --> 03:46:36,696
ahead and make another acrobatics check.

3289
03:46:36,696 --> 03:46:39,329
LIAM: Holy fuck.

3290
03:46:39,329 --> 03:46:49,161
LAURA: Acrobatics. That's Pike. Acrobatics. 25.

3291
03:46:49,161 --> 03:46:56,369
MATT: 25. So it does not progress into restrained.
You're still grappled, it's still holding on to

3292
03:46:56,369 --> 03:47:02,105
you, but you manage to swivel out of its grasp, as
it's trying to pull you in, and it's starting to

3293
03:47:02,105 --> 03:47:08,998
try and bite into you. As you glance upward, now
that you're drifting, dangling roughly 60 feet up,

3294
03:47:08,998 --> 03:47:15,056
you look up, and you can see what is the top of
the ravine, and it is a writhing mass of hundreds

3295
03:47:15,056 --> 03:47:21,388
and hundreds of undead corpses that are all
reaching out for you, their different-boned claws

3296
03:47:21,388 --> 03:47:29,556
all extended, going (rasping), trying to just pull
you towards them into empty air, as you dangle,

3297
03:47:29,556 --> 03:47:31,007
looking up into that.

3298
03:47:31,007 --> 03:47:32,314
LIAM: This is fine.

3299
03:47:32,314 --> 03:47:33,607
LAURA: Oh. My. God.

3300
03:47:33,607 --> 03:47:34,875
MARISHA: Everything's okay.

3301
03:47:34,875 --> 03:47:36,451
LAURA: Everything's fine, you guys.

3302
03:47:36,451 --> 03:47:46,136
MATT: At which point, the vine pulls the broom,
Pike, you, and the creature up towards the edge of

3303
03:47:46,136 --> 03:47:51,344
the wall. So you're still 30 feet up, but you're
slammed into the side of the wall, now, the vine

3304
03:47:51,344 --> 03:47:53,985
is just holding the broom taut against the edge of
the rocks.

3305
03:47:53,985 --> 03:47:55,074
MARISHA: Sorry!

3306
03:47:55,074 --> 03:48:01,274
LAURA: No, I love you! You're amazing! Can I just
take out-- I just have a dagger, can I pull out my

3307
03:48:01,274 --> 03:48:04,987
dagger and try to jam it up into the zombie's--
under his chin?

3308
03:48:04,987 --> 03:48:09,643
MATT: Go for it. It's going to attempt to bite
attack you, by the way. Which it does not do with

3309
03:48:09,643 --> 03:48:13,470
a two. Just getting your armor, gnawing on the
leather.

3310
03:48:13,470 --> 03:48:20,818
LAURA: Oh, it's all zombie drool! I am really bad
at regular attacks. What do I add to this?

3311
03:48:20,818 --> 03:48:27,979
MATT: You add your dexterity and your proficiency
modifier. So it would be plus ten, I think.

3312
03:48:27,979 --> 03:48:28,885
LAURA: So 20.

3313
03:48:28,885 --> 03:48:32,282
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you jam it with the dagger.
Go ahead and roll damage. That's 1d4 plus your

3314
03:48:32,282 --> 03:48:33,763
dexterity modifier.

3315
03:48:33,763 --> 03:48:39,797
LAURA: Oh, plus my dexterity. I didn't roll a 20,
I rolled--

3316
03:48:39,797 --> 03:48:43,498
MATT: It's a d4 plus five, is what you're rolling
for damage.

3317
03:48:43,498 --> 03:48:45,509
LAURA: Eight.

3318
03:48:45,509 --> 03:48:53,240
MATT: Okay, so eight damage. You jam the dagger up
into its jaw and throat, and it slaps it out of

3319
03:48:53,240 --> 03:49:00,870
the way. You can see it's damaged, but it's still
holding on. The creature's now grabbing onto you

3320
03:49:00,870 --> 03:49:02,899
and slamming you into the wall best it can.

3321
03:49:02,899 --> 03:49:04,337
LAURA: What is Pike doing?

3322
03:49:04,337 --> 03:49:12,546
MATT: Pike is just holding onto the broom right
now. She's going to attempt to-- actually, what

3323
03:49:12,546 --> 03:49:17,797
she would do in this moment would be Turn Undead.
'Cause that's what clerics do.

3324
03:49:17,797 --> 03:49:22,026
LAURA: I didn't even see that spell, where's that
spell?

3325
03:49:22,026 --> 03:49:24,015
MATT: It's not a spell, it's her Channel Divinity
ability.

3326
03:49:24,015 --> 03:49:30,392
PATRICK: Yeah, it's Channel Divinity, but I
couldn't do it from the edge of the pit.

3327
03:49:30,392 --> 03:49:31,680
It's 30 feet.

3328
03:49:31,680 --> 03:49:37,602
MATT: Yeah, you have to be closer from there.
Okay, so it has to make a saving throw, which it

3329
03:49:37,602 --> 03:49:43,261
does not make. So as you look over and this
zombie's biting at you and you're trying to jam at

3330
03:49:43,261 --> 03:49:47,927
it, Pike, who's holding onto the broom, grabs the
symbol of Sarenrae from around her neck and looks

3331
03:49:47,927 --> 03:49:52,438
up and just closes her eyes for a second, and as
they flash open again, there's no pupils, just

3332
03:49:52,438 --> 03:49:59,463
white, bright, vibrant, radiant eyes. This small
shockwave bursts off her, and you watch as the

3333
03:49:59,463 --> 03:50:03,680
zombie goes (gasps) just turns into ash and
disintegrates, its body just tumbling in chunks

3334
03:50:03,680 --> 03:50:05,701
and pieces up into the ravine above you.

3335
03:50:05,701 --> 03:50:08,534
LAURA: So I would look down at Pike.

3336
03:50:08,534 --> 03:50:13,662
MATT: Yes, and then up at where the zombie went.
Pike is below you, still holding onto the broom.

3337
03:50:13,662 --> 03:50:20,437
LAURA: You're amazing! That was amazing! This was
a mistake. How do we get down?

3338
03:50:20,437 --> 03:50:22,557
MATT: "I don't know. Keyleth?"

3339
03:50:22,557 --> 03:50:25,501
MARISHA: I'm holding on, man.

3340
03:50:25,501 --> 03:50:29,931
LIAM: Where's the carpet, where's the carpet,
where's the carpet?

3341
03:50:29,931 --> 03:50:31,417
TALIESIN: The carpet is not what we need.

3342
03:50:31,417 --> 03:50:35,818
MATT: A few more corpses start tumbling up.

3343
03:50:35,818 --> 03:50:41,577
TALIESIN: The rope that is currently tied at the
other end of the ravine, where they're currently

3344
03:50:41,577 --> 03:50:44,460
above us, right?

3345
03:50:44,460 --> 03:50:48,082
MATT: Yes, they're about 30 feet above you guys on
the opposite side.

3346
03:50:48,082 --> 03:50:51,621
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and reverse rappel with
the rope, the other end of the endless rope,

3347
03:50:51,621 --> 03:50:52,522
up to them.

3348
03:50:52,522 --> 03:50:59,418
MARISHA: Also, as a bonus action, I can switch the
direction of the vine to lash out at the same

3349
03:50:59,418 --> 03:51:08,940
creature as a bonus action, so can I grasp a vine
and hand them off and stair-step them down?

3350
03:51:08,940 --> 03:51:16,304
MATT: No, the vine is attached at a base, it's
almost like it grew out of the ground, so what

3351
03:51:16,304 --> 03:51:21,247
Grasping Vine allows you to do, is you can--
wherever it's based at, it pulls it to it.

3352
03:51:21,247 --> 03:51:27,127
MARISHA: Right. It just says, until the spell
ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the

3353
03:51:27,127 --> 03:51:30,115
same creature on my bonus action. So.

3354
03:51:30,115 --> 03:51:34,763
MATT: It doesn't do damage. What it does is it
just grasps and pulls towards it. So what you can

3355
03:51:34,763 --> 03:51:38,426
do is, each turn you can change the target. If you
change the target, it's gonna release the broom

3356
03:51:38,426 --> 03:51:39,865
and they're both gonna tumble up.

3357
03:51:39,865 --> 03:51:42,747
MARISHA: Well, I don't wanna do that. But I can't
change the origin of the vine?

3358
03:51:42,747 --> 03:51:44,278
MATT: Not without casting the spell again.

3359
03:51:44,278 --> 03:51:47,324
TALIESIN: I'm gonna reverse-Batman this shit.

3360
03:51:47,324 --> 03:51:49,853
MATT: All right, so you start reverse-rappelling
up the side. What's everyone else doing?

3361
03:51:49,853 --> 03:51:51,936
LIAM: Where's Grog and the flying carpet?

3362
03:51:51,936 --> 03:51:57,341
MATT: Grog, Kerrek, and Keyleth are all still on
the other side with Kima and Allura. They're all

3363
03:51:57,341 --> 03:51:58,641
on the other side of the ravine.

3364
03:51:58,641 --> 03:52:00,583
LIAM: Get off the rug, get off the rug. Get off
the rug, now, please.

3365
03:52:00,583 --> 03:52:02,021
MARISHA: I'm not on the rug!

3366
03:52:02,021 --> 03:52:06,069
LIAM: Isn't anyone on the rug? That's why I
asked.

3367
03:52:06,069 --> 03:52:08,291
MATT: The rug is still with them, it's on the
other side.

3368
03:52:08,291 --> 03:52:10,583
LIAM: Back where it was. Shit.

3369
03:52:10,583 --> 03:52:12,029
MATT: Nobody's taken the rug across--

3370
03:52:12,029 --> 03:52:14,605
TALIESIN: The rug's a terrible idea, right now,
anyway.

3371
03:52:14,605 --> 03:52:18,044
TRAVIS: I can't get on the rug, so one of you
lighter people, will you go get those two,

3372
03:52:18,044 --> 03:52:19,235
please?

3373
03:52:19,235 --> 03:52:22,914
TALIESIN: I'm just, I'm going up super fucking
fast.

3374
03:52:22,914 --> 03:52:26,838
MATT: Okay, so you rappel up the side. While
they're holding on there, one more corpse tumbles

3375
03:52:26,838 --> 03:52:29,311
up past. It's going to attempt to--

3376
03:52:29,311 --> 03:52:40,803
LAURA: Can I-- no, I can't do that. I'm like
floating, basically. Basically I'm like falling

3377
03:52:40,803 --> 03:52:44,739
and just held onto a broom that's being held onto
the wall.

3378
03:52:44,739 --> 03:52:51,336
MATT: Right now, if you were to try and take a
shot, you could try, but you'd be at disadvantage

3379
03:52:51,336 --> 03:52:52,518
for all your attacks.

3380
03:52:52,518 --> 03:52:56,276
LAURA: I want to try to-- any zombies or undead
that come near us, I want to try to shoot them

3381
03:52:56,276 --> 03:52:57,781
and at least ricochet.

3382
03:52:57,781 --> 03:53:01,047
MATT: Okay, well, one comes tumbling past.
What are you doing, Kerr?

3383
03:53:01,047 --> 03:53:05,683
PATRICK: If nobody else on this side is getting on
this carpet, then I will.

3384
03:53:05,683 --> 03:53:08,573
MATT: Okay, so Kerrek hops on the carpet and it
begins to lift above the ground.

3385
03:53:08,573 --> 03:53:11,514
MARISHA: Can I get on it as well and still
maintain the concentration on my Grasping Vine?

3386
03:53:11,514 --> 03:53:14,195
TRAVIS: But why would you do that, because you've
gotta put two people on that carpet?

3387
03:53:14,195 --> 03:53:15,939
MARISHA: What?

3388
03:53:15,939 --> 03:53:17,816
TRAVIS: We're trying to put them on the carpet,
right?

3389
03:53:17,816 --> 03:53:24,048
TALIESIN: It can hold four or five people.

3390
03:53:24,048 --> 03:53:30,748
MARISHA: I'm trying to hold the concentration on
their Grasping Vine so they don't get fucked. So

3391
03:53:30,748 --> 03:53:33,921
I'm going to get on the carpet.

3392
03:53:33,921 --> 03:53:37,432
TRAVIS: You know, if you get hit by something that
falls.

3393
03:53:37,432 --> 03:53:42,394
MARISHA: That's true. But I have advantage on
concentration checks these days.

3394
03:53:42,394 --> 03:53:44,060
MATT: Allura--

3395
03:53:44,060 --> 03:53:47,337
LAURA: Oh my god.

3396
03:53:47,337 --> 03:53:48,881
TALIESIN: Hang on, I'm coming.

3397
03:53:48,881 --> 03:53:54,505
LAURA: Yeah, no, that's the thing. Percy's on his
way to save us, so you guys just try to hold onto

3398
03:53:54,505 --> 03:53:55,684
that carpet.

3399
03:53:55,684 --> 03:53:57,409
TALIESIN: Get across, we need people to pull us
back.

3400
03:53:57,409 --> 03:54:02,731
MARISHA: Also, Grasping Vine's not a concentration
spell. It's a bonus action, and-- no, no, it's a

3401
03:54:02,731 --> 03:54:03,867
concentration spell.

3402
03:54:03,867 --> 03:54:13,351
MATT: Allura, watching this happen, grabs Kima and
Dimension Doors across to the other side, sets

3403
03:54:13,351 --> 03:54:15,726
Kima aside, and just stays there, waiting
carefully.

3404
03:54:15,726 --> 03:54:17,835
MARISHA: Scanlan does have Dimension Door.

3405
03:54:17,835 --> 03:54:19,506
LAURA: He does. He could do it for himself.

3406
03:54:19,506 --> 03:54:25,946
MATT: And one other person of equal size, which is
only Pike. And Kima, technically, but Kima's

3407
03:54:25,946 --> 03:54:27,089
already gotten across.

3408
03:54:27,089 --> 03:54:29,426
LAURA: That sucks, 'cause Scanlan could've taken
Kima.

3409
03:54:29,426 --> 03:54:31,956
TALIESIN: Scanlan also has a plan, if you guys are
about to really fucking die.

3410
03:54:31,956 --> 03:54:36,502
MATT: So you're just waiting. Kerrek and Keyleth
are going across. Are you guys going just directly

3411
03:54:36,502 --> 03:54:38,655
across, or are you going towards Vex and--

3412
03:54:38,655 --> 03:54:47,577
PATRICK: Well, if they were to fall, I'm heading
wherever below that is, toward them, to offer

3413
03:54:47,577 --> 03:54:53,930
support if they lose it. I'm also ready to Turn
Undead if a big cluster of these things comes

3414
03:54:53,930 --> 03:54:55,090
towards us.

3415
03:54:55,090 --> 03:54:59,195
MARISHA: I'm maintaining concentration while
floating next to Kerr on the carpet.

3416
03:54:59,195 --> 03:55:02,593
MATT: All right, so you guys, as the carpet heads
out, you hearing the carpet as you move forward,

3417
03:55:02,593 --> 03:55:08,951
Kerrek, you barrel roll the carpet and begin
heading upward to float underneath where Pike and

3418
03:55:08,951 --> 03:55:14,209
Vex will be. As you begin heading upward, it's
funny you mention that. What were singular bodies

3419
03:55:14,209 --> 03:55:21,417
tumbling upward are now groupings. Four or five,
almost chained together, like these small balls of

3420
03:55:21,417 --> 03:55:30,091
just limbs and bones and gnashing zombified teeth
begin just (falling sounds) upward. One of them

3421
03:55:30,091 --> 03:55:38,371
slams into the bridge and scatters out, sending a
number of bodies spinning outward, broken arms and

3422
03:55:38,371 --> 03:55:42,544
limbs from the impact. The bridge itself cracks a
bit, and you watch as the center of it is still

3423
03:55:42,544 --> 03:55:46,749
being held by a rope, but it is currently not overly
walkable without holding the rope to get across.

3424
03:55:46,749 --> 03:55:50,352
TALIESIN: You can use the rope just to steady
yourself on the carpet.

3425
03:55:50,352 --> 03:55:55,278
MATT: One of these clusters starts making its way
upwards towards where the carpet is.

3426
03:55:55,278 --> 03:56:04,816
PATRICK: If I'm steering the carpet, can I dodge
away from this? Because even if I Turn it, they

3427
03:56:04,816 --> 03:56:06,043
will have velocity.

3428
03:56:06,043 --> 03:56:15,109
MATT: Correct. You have not driven a magic carpet
before. I would ask you to go ahead and, let's

3429
03:56:15,109 --> 03:56:17,592
see, for this? Make an intelligence check.

3430
03:56:17,592 --> 03:56:19,014
PATRICK: Jesus is my copilot.

3431
03:56:19,014 --> 03:56:20,416
(laughter)

3432
03:56:20,416 --> 03:56:22,381
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check,
just a straight d20

3433
03:56:22,381 --> 03:56:23,663
plus your intelligence modifier.

3434
03:56:23,663 --> 03:56:29,936
PATRICK: The first fucking character I make where
I lowball intelligence.

3435
03:56:29,936 --> 03:56:31,893
(laughter)

3436
03:56:31,893 --> 03:56:39,895
PATRICK: Oh. That is a-- just straight?

3437
03:56:39,895 --> 03:56:42,139
MATT: Well, plus your modifier, whatever that is.

3438
03:56:42,139 --> 03:56:44,562
PATRICK: Wait, my proficiency modifier?

3439
03:56:44,562 --> 03:56:46,143
MATT: Your intelligence modifier.

3440
03:56:46,143 --> 03:56:48,992
PATRICK: Oh, yeah, no. That's an eight.

3441
03:56:48,992 --> 03:56:56,767
MATT: Okay. So, moving this across, you're
basically watching this thing come careening

3442
03:56:56,767 --> 03:57:02,454
upwards, and you're trying to shift out of the way
to maintain momentum and have this not impact you,

3443
03:57:02,454 --> 03:57:10,323
but both the nerves of what's happening, the
unfamiliarity with the change in gravity and not

3444
03:57:10,323 --> 03:57:14,881
running a carpet before, you move out of the way
just as it slams into the upper corner, causing

3445
03:57:14,881 --> 03:57:20,085
the carpet to shift and quake. Oh man.

3446
03:57:20,085 --> 03:57:25,995
PATRICK: Can I push Keyleth hard enough to get her
to the other side?

3447
03:57:25,995 --> 03:57:33,142
MATT: You guys were heading upward, so if you were
to kick her off, she would probably still arc

3448
03:57:33,142 --> 03:57:38,774
upward at this point. You guys are essentially, in
theory, you're below the ravine if this were

3449
03:57:38,774 --> 03:57:40,001
normal gravity.

3450
03:57:40,001 --> 03:57:41,661
MARISHA: How close are we to--

3451
03:57:41,661 --> 03:57:47,134
MATT: You guys are about 30 feet across, 'cause
the movement speed of the carpet is, if I recall,

3452
03:57:47,134 --> 03:57:49,054
from what I told you, right, it was 30 feet?

3453
03:57:49,054 --> 03:57:50,988
MARISHA: So we're not close to Pike and Vex.

3454
03:57:50,988 --> 03:57:52,164
MATT: Not yet. You're halfway there.

3455
03:57:52,164 --> 03:57:58,748
TALIESIN: Just so you know, the second my feet hit
the stone of the upper wall, I'm going to hold

3456
03:57:58,748 --> 03:58:01,562
on-- I no longer have to repose, I've got the
spider, I'm going to

3457
03:58:01,562 --> 03:58:03,514
double-dash towards them with the rope.

3458
03:58:03,514 --> 03:58:09,076
MATT: So, as they get hit, Percy has just made it
up the wall to you and Pike.

3459
03:58:09,076 --> 03:58:11,837
TALIESIN: And I'm just tying them to the rope.

3460
03:58:11,837 --> 03:58:13,766
MATT: Double-dash got you there.

3461
03:58:13,766 --> 03:58:19,054
MARISHA: If Kerr's kicking me off, I'm reaching
for Pike and the broom and still trying to maintain

3462
03:58:19,054 --> 03:58:21,835
concentration while trying to reach for those
guys.

3463
03:58:21,835 --> 03:58:28,914
MATT: Okay, well, first and foremost. First and
foremost. Oh man, this got really complicated. I

3464
03:58:28,914 --> 03:58:43,482
love it, it's great. I-- okay. I would like both
Kerr and Keyleth to roll strength saving throws to

3465
03:58:43,482 --> 03:58:45,658
maintain hold on the carpet.

3466
03:58:45,658 --> 03:58:47,904
LIAM: How far are they from me?

3467
03:58:47,904 --> 03:58:51,517
MATT: They're about-- right now? 35, 40 feet.

3468
03:58:51,517 --> 03:58:55,643
PATRICK: You get a plus three, by the way.

3469
03:58:55,643 --> 03:58:56,940
MARISHA: I do?

3470
03:58:56,940 --> 03:59:04,400
MATT: Yes, you do. From being just near him. He's
so awesome that when you're near him--

3471
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:06,171
Paladins, man.

3472
03:59:06,171 --> 03:59:09,246
LIAM: I'm on the very edge. Close as I can get,
right?

3473
03:59:09,246 --> 03:59:10,495
MARISHA: 14.

3474
03:59:10,495 --> 03:59:11,986
MATT: 14? Okay. Kerr?

3475
03:59:11,986 --> 03:59:14,108
PATRICK: 23.

3476
03:59:14,108 --> 03:59:23,752
MATT: You both maintain your grip on the carpet. I
will say, for the sake of this, Keyleth, make a

3477
03:59:23,752 --> 03:59:24,812
concentration check.

3478
03:59:24,812 --> 03:59:28,281
MARISHA: I have my advantage 'cause of Warcaster,
yeah?

3479
03:59:28,281 --> 03:59:29,618
MATT: Yes, you do.

3480
03:59:29,618 --> 03:59:32,784
MARISHA: That one's cocked.

3481
03:59:32,784 --> 03:59:34,268
MATT: You just need to beat a ten.

3482
03:59:34,268 --> 03:59:37,401
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, I beat that ten with a 26.

3483
03:59:37,401 --> 03:59:39,759
MATT: Okay, so you maintain concentration, you
maintain hold of the carpet. The carpet rights

3484
03:59:39,759 --> 03:59:45,972
itself, the corpses go spinning upward into the
abyss above. The carpet has now spent the rest of

3485
03:59:45,972 --> 03:59:52,699
its turn getting into position to guard you and
Pike, just in case it's necessary. So. You guys

3486
03:59:52,856 --> 03:59:54,673
are in place. Percy, you've tied the rope--

3487
03:59:54,673 --> 03:59:58,218
TALIESIN: Tied them, holding onto everybody, and I
just have been yelling, pull!

3488
03:59:58,218 --> 04:00:00,186
MARISHA: What?

3489
04:00:00,186 --> 04:00:02,869
TALIESIN: I've got them on the rope, pull the rope
down!

3490
04:00:02,869 --> 04:00:03,977
LAURA: That's you.

3491
04:00:03,977 --> 04:00:05,439
TALIESIN: Who else is on that side of the--

3492
04:00:05,439 --> 04:00:06,785
MATT: Right now, it's Kima and Allura as well.

3493
04:00:06,785 --> 04:00:10,091
TALIESIN: Yeah, as many people as can start
running out that way.

3494
04:00:10,091 --> 04:00:13,741
MATT: You guys all grab the rope that's currently
affixed to Percy, that hopefully you've been

3495
04:00:13,741 --> 04:00:17,289
holding this whole time. I'm imagining you
would've.

3496
04:00:17,289 --> 04:00:19,382
LIAM: I don't know, where's the rope? There's so
much going on.

3497
04:00:19,382 --> 04:00:23,629
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my spider-walk ability
to actually just maintain everything and just keep

3498
04:00:23,629 --> 04:00:26,626
an eye out and try and safety-spot everything.

3499
04:00:26,626 --> 04:00:34,322
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and start pulling the
rope. Kima and Allura help out. Allura's not doing

3500
04:00:34,322 --> 04:00:36,300
much, eight, unfortunately, but Kima is.

3501
04:00:36,300 --> 04:00:42,829
PATRICK: And we were technically below them. I'll
just bring the carpet towards them and elevator

3502
04:00:42,829 --> 04:00:44,396
them up if I can get below.

3503
04:00:44,396 --> 04:00:50,240
MATT: Okay, cool. So now we have Kerrek and
Keyleth. Keyleth, are you releasing the vine?

3504
04:00:50,240 --> 04:00:52,909
Because it's currently what's holding them against
the stone wall.

3505
04:00:52,909 --> 04:00:54,494
MARISHA: Are you grabbing onto the carpet?

3506
04:00:54,494 --> 04:00:59,865
MATT: They both have ropes they're grabbing onto
from Percy, and they're being pulled below. Do a

3507
04:00:59,865 --> 04:01:00,960
strength check.

3508
04:01:00,960 --> 04:01:04,974
MARISHA: I let go, and can I switch to a Gust
cantrip to try and push us down?

3509
04:01:04,974 --> 04:01:10,069
MATT: Gust cantrip is not gonna be strong enough
to push anyone of your weight.

3510
04:01:10,069 --> 04:01:12,262
Cantrips are very simple.

3511
04:01:12,262 --> 04:01:14,601
LIAM: I rolled a 19, so 21.

3512
04:01:14,601 --> 04:01:21,278
MATT: 21, good, so between you and Kima, you both
begin to just hand-over-hand, pulling the rope as

3513
04:01:21,278 --> 04:01:31,248
it's taut up against the edge and upward. Vex,
Pike, you both begin being pulled upwards, and

3514
04:01:31,248 --> 04:01:40,720
Kerr, you're lifting with Keyleth, keeping that.
You guys get right to the edge. You look down as

3515
04:01:40,720 --> 04:01:47,402
you see this one cluster of what looks to be maybe
20 or so bodies comes up, not as a ball, but what

3516
04:01:47,402 --> 04:01:52,836
looks to be almost a giant skeletal hand made up
of smaller corpses is tumbling upward and

3517
04:01:52,836 --> 04:01:59,390
reaching, its outstretched, large, maybe
15-foot-wide grasp towards this carpet.

3518
04:01:59,390 --> 04:02:01,538
LAURA: Oh my god.

3519
04:02:01,538 --> 04:02:05,313
PATRICK: I do Channel Divinity on that shit.

3520
04:02:05,313 --> 04:02:10,711
MATT: Okay. So what is your save DC for your spell
DC?

3521
04:02:10,711 --> 04:02:18,614
LAURA: Grog's still on the other side.

3522
04:02:18,614 --> 04:02:20,184
TALIESIN: And Scanlan.

3523
04:02:20,184 --> 04:02:22,214
LAURA: Oh, no, this is perfect.

3524
04:02:22,214 --> 04:02:23,839
PATRICK: 14.

3525
04:02:23,839 --> 04:02:36,419
MATT: 14. Okay. Hold on just a second, real fast.
So for your Channel Divinity here, it's eight plus

3526
04:02:36,419 --> 04:02:38,774
your proficiency bonus plus your charisma
modifier.

3527
04:02:38,774 --> 04:02:47,242
PATRICK: So eight plus... that'd be seven plus,
yeah, that's right.

3528
04:02:47,242 --> 04:02:48,605
MATT: 15?

3529
04:02:48,605 --> 04:02:54,083
PATRICK: 14. Oh, you're right, you're right, 15.

3530
04:02:54,083 --> 04:02:56,819
MATT: 15, yeah. All right. Cool. So, with that.

3531
04:02:56,819 --> 04:03:06,028
LAURA: This is a really cool setup, Matt, though.
It's really fucking badass.

3532
04:03:06,028 --> 04:03:08,107
MARISHA: It's a pain in our ass, but it's really
awesome.

3533
04:03:08,107 --> 04:03:11,038
LAURA: The visual of it is amazing.

3534
04:03:11,038 --> 04:03:12,970
MATT: I'm enjoying this quite a bit.

3535
04:03:12,970 --> 04:03:20,066
MARISHA: Dead bodies falling to the ceiling,
reaching up, yeah, no, it's cool. This is

3536
04:03:20,066 --> 04:03:22,632
definitely a Brendan Frasier movie.

3537
04:03:22,632 --> 04:03:25,332
LAURA: Yeah, for sure.

3538
04:03:25,332 --> 04:03:38,747
MATT: Okay, so. As this giant, skeletal hand
reaches upwards to basically scoop up the entirety

3539
04:03:38,747 --> 04:03:43,306
of the cluster of everyone gathered right at the
edge of this ravine, the carpet pushing them

3540
04:03:43,306 --> 04:03:49,534
inward, it's almost gonna sandwich the party into
the palm of this, you watch as Kerrek, clutching

3541
04:03:49,534 --> 04:03:56,832
the edge of the carpet, reaches up from beneath
his armor and grabs his own holy symbol, clutches

3542
04:03:56,832 --> 04:04:01,733
it firm in his grasp and looks upward, shouting a
whispered word that doesn't reach anybody's ears

3543
04:04:01,733 --> 04:04:06,901
but the ones that it's intended for. And as it
does, you watch as a piercing bit of light

3544
04:04:06,901 --> 04:04:14,055
jettisons in an upward-- or downward direction
from your perspective-- towards this hand. As it

3545
04:04:14,055 --> 04:04:19,212
reaches out its outstretched zombie fingers, it
bursts, and as it does, the hand is scattered

3546
04:04:19,212 --> 04:04:25,494
outward in a small shockwave. All the bodies, once
linked, are now sent into separate, disparate

3547
04:04:25,494 --> 04:04:31,225
spinning corpses that all reach out helplessly as
they all go scattering past upward and

3548
04:04:31,225 --> 04:04:37,238
disappearing into the ravine above. With that
final push, you all get down on the opposite side

3549
04:04:37,238 --> 04:04:38,817
of the ravine, safe and sound.

3550
04:04:38,817 --> 04:04:43,583
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

3551
04:04:43,583 --> 04:04:52,316
TALIESIN: I grab you and give you a big kiss. Big,
sexy, still-tied-up makeout kiss. Hey, well done

3552
04:04:52,316 --> 04:04:55,082
not passing out this time. Good for you.

3553
04:04:55,082 --> 04:04:58,242
LAURA: Thanks for saving me, darling. You.

3554
04:04:58,242 --> 04:05:00,483
MATT: Grog and Scanlan are waving from the other
side of the ravine.

3555
04:05:00,483 --> 04:05:07,075
TALIESIN: I untie the broom and the--

3556
04:05:07,075 --> 04:05:10,396
LAURA: Don't untie it all, I like being attached
to it.

3557
04:05:10,396 --> 04:05:16,852
MARISHA: And I go over to Percy and I say,
smitten. Smitten.

3558
04:05:16,852 --> 04:05:19,354
TALIESIN: I slowly start shoving Keyleth back
towards the ravine.

3559
04:05:19,354 --> 04:05:24,845
MATT: Just Scanlan's arms crossed, and his eyes
are very wide, and he's kind of looking around.

3560
04:05:24,845 --> 04:05:26,796
TALIESIN: Scanlan's with Grog.

3561
04:05:26,796 --> 04:05:28,095
MATT: I know.

3562
04:05:28,095 --> 04:05:29,856
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're just kind of watching the
fucking show.

3563
04:05:29,856 --> 04:05:31,974
MATT: "So. What do you think?"

3564
04:05:31,974 --> 04:05:33,529
TRAVIS: I think we just leave 'em.

3565
04:05:33,529 --> 04:05:37,878
MATT: "Yeah, you're right, let's go." You watch as
Scanlan and Grog turn around and start walking

3566
04:05:37,878 --> 04:05:39,247
back from where you guys came.

3567
04:05:39,247 --> 04:05:47,458
LIAM: Hand around Kerrek's neck, pulling him in.
Thank you. Thank you. Fucking thank you.

3568
04:05:47,458 --> 04:05:56,667
PATRICK: That... that... so this is pretty much
just a Tuesday for you guys, right?

3569
04:05:56,667 --> 04:05:58,576
TALIESIN: It's more of a Thursday.

3570
04:05:58,576 --> 04:06:03,634
(laughter)

3571
04:06:03,634 --> 04:06:10,352
LAURA: I give Kerr a big hug. Thank you. Saved the
day.

3572
04:06:10,352 --> 04:06:16,593
MATT: A giant impact, as behind you, another
sphere of these corpses slams into the bridge,

3573
04:06:16,593 --> 04:06:20,952
causing it to snap and go limp against the upper
portion of the ravine.

3574
04:06:20,952 --> 04:06:23,547
TALIESIN: Well, okay, how are we going to get the
last-- there's still a rope.

3575
04:06:23,547 --> 04:06:29,247
TRAVIS: I had a question. So I take one of my five
empty jugs out of the Bag of Holding, and I go to

3576
04:06:29,247 --> 04:06:34,260
the edge. While they were up there doing all that
shit. I look down and I just throw it straight

3577
04:06:34,260 --> 04:06:37,494
down as hard as I can. Does it immediately go
whoop?

3578
04:06:37,494 --> 04:06:39,708
MATT: Yep. Upwards.

3579
04:06:39,871 --> 04:06:42,506
TALIESIN: Bit of an arc. You want to pee, don't
you?

3580
04:06:42,506 --> 04:06:49,995
PATRICK: I see what you're doing, and I grab just
whatever, a rock or something. I try to throw it

3581
04:06:49,995 --> 04:06:51,472
straight across.

3582
04:06:51,472 --> 04:06:53,461
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.

3583
04:06:53,461 --> 04:07:01,641
PATRICK: Because it should fall at first, but if
it's 50/50, it should fall and then fall the other

3584
04:07:01,641 --> 04:07:03,321
way, and it'll go right across.

3585
04:07:03,321 --> 04:07:05,023
TRAVIS: Right, so if you did a jump.

3586
04:07:05,023 --> 04:07:09,552
LIAM: It's like Angry Birds. If you get the arc
right.

3587
04:07:09,552 --> 04:07:14,823
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. You grab the end
of the rope that's still tied, of our endless

3588
04:07:14,823 --> 04:07:20,112
rope. On the count of three, Scanlan's going to
jump on your back, on the count of three, they're

3589
04:07:20,112 --> 04:07:24,760
going to make a running jump, and we're going to
run, all of us holding like a giant game of

3590
04:07:24,760 --> 04:07:26,148
tug-of-war, and just see if we can pull them
across like a kite.

3591
04:07:26,148 --> 04:07:28,186
TRAVIS: I will pull you all into the chasm.

3592
04:07:28,186 --> 04:07:30,180
MARISHA: I thought everyone was over.

3593
04:07:30,180 --> 04:07:31,867
MATT: Scanlan and Grog.

3594
04:07:31,867 --> 04:07:33,453
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

3595
04:07:33,453 --> 04:07:38,110
TALIESIN: Well, if you tie yourself to the rope,
too, no matter what, we'll be able to-- so you'll

3596
04:07:38,110 --> 04:07:39,402
at least be tethered.

3597
04:07:39,402 --> 04:07:44,015
TRAVIS: Can't somebody fly the carpet back over
and then-- can't Pike fly it back over, and then

3598
04:07:44,015 --> 04:07:47,824
she and Scanlan can bamf over, and then I can just
try and make it across with the carpet.

3599
04:07:47,824 --> 04:07:53,892
LAURA: Well, I could go over on the fucking broom
again, dear lord. How about the bodies? Are they

3600
04:07:53,892 --> 04:07:55,282
still flying?

3601
04:07:55,282 --> 04:07:57,867
MATT: They're still going past, and it's like
little singular ones here and there, but every now

3602
04:07:57,867 --> 04:07:59,273
and then a cluster.

3603
04:07:59,273 --> 04:08:02,879
LAURA: Thing is, I can put Grog in the necklace
and bring him over.

3604
04:08:02,879 --> 04:08:04,796
MARISHA: Grog, can you backpack Scanlan?

3605
04:08:04,796 --> 04:08:08,417
TRAVIS: Yeah. And then what?

3606
04:08:08,417 --> 04:08:11,494
MARISHA: And jump really hard?

3607
04:08:11,494 --> 04:08:13,196
TALIESIN: Chain of Returning?

3608
04:08:13,196 --> 04:08:18,012
MATT: Chain of Returning is-- what's the range on
that?

3609
04:08:18,012 --> 04:08:21,315
LAURA: 40 feet? Or is it 60 feet?

3610
04:08:21,315 --> 04:08:24,692
TRAVIS: It is somewhere.

3611
04:08:24,692 --> 04:08:26,272
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy idea.

3612
04:08:26,272 --> 04:08:28,886
TRAVIS: Doesn't have a range.

3613
04:08:28,886 --> 04:08:36,879
MATT: I want to say we have it set at a 30-foot
range. It's a big weapon.

3614
04:08:36,879 --> 04:08:38,882
TRAVIS: Sure, I'm down with that, 30 feet.

3615
04:08:38,882 --> 04:08:40,522
MATT: Are you attaching it to your hammer?

3616
04:08:40,522 --> 04:08:47,551
TRAVIS: No, I'm not attuned to that. I've got the
little hammer now. Oh, sorry, the hammer, yes.

3617
04:08:47,551 --> 04:08:51,553
MATT: So yeah, that has a furthest range of 60
feet.

3618
04:08:51,553 --> 04:08:53,807
TRAVIS: How far across the chasm is the thing?

3619
04:08:53,807 --> 04:08:55,271
MATT: 60 feet.

3620
04:08:55,271 --> 04:08:58,072
MARISHA: Can you attach the Chain of Returning to
the hammer?

3621
04:08:58,072 --> 04:09:01,850
TRAVIS: I mean, I can essentially attach it to
anything, I think.

3622
04:09:01,850 --> 04:09:03,784
LAURA: I feel like I could go back over.

3623
04:09:03,784 --> 04:09:06,132
TALIESIN: (laughs) Sorry.

3624
04:09:06,132 --> 04:09:09,020
LAURA: I know, I rolled a one, though, you guys.
It was real shit.

3625
04:09:09,020 --> 04:09:11,857
MARISHA: How much time has it been?

3626
04:09:11,857 --> 04:09:17,196
MATT: Has passed? I'd say you've probably hit a
good minute, little over a minute since the very

3627
04:09:17,196 --> 04:09:21,355
beginning of this endeavor. Probably a little
longer. Given time to look over it since it

3628
04:09:21,355 --> 04:09:25,373
happened, and converse about what to do.

3629
04:09:25,373 --> 04:09:32,023
PATRICK: I say, if we have a rope tied to her, we
could bring her back if something bad happened.

3630
04:09:32,023 --> 04:09:39,207
LAURA: Totally, totally. All right, cool. Attach a
rope to me. I bamf Trinket out so my necklace is

3631
04:09:39,207 --> 04:09:43,421
empty, and then I take off across the channel.

3632
04:09:43,421 --> 04:09:45,373
TALIESIN: But we have two, are we just going to do
it twice?

3633
04:09:45,373 --> 04:09:47,147
LAURA: Scanlan can get on the broom.

3634
04:09:47,147 --> 04:09:50,221
TALIESIN: Oh, and Grog can get in the necklace!
That's very clever.

3635
04:09:50,221 --> 04:09:51,888
LAURA: So I want to fly back over.

3636
04:09:51,888 --> 04:09:53,381
MATT: All right, so.

3637
04:09:53,381 --> 04:09:56,668
LAURA: Heart pounding, this was terrifying. I'm
sorry, buddy.

3638
04:09:56,668 --> 04:10:01,672
MATT: You jump onto the broom, steel yourself.

3639
04:10:01,672 --> 04:10:07,156
TALIESIN: I'm gonna anchor this rope also to
Trinket, just so there's extra weight.

3640
04:10:07,156 --> 04:10:10,343
MATT: Trinket happily allows that anchoring
to happen.

3641
04:10:10,343 --> 04:10:12,492
TALIESIN: All right, you guys feed it, I'm gonna
be ready.

3642
04:10:12,492 --> 04:10:16,412
MATT: You barrel-roll across. Across the way--

3643
04:10:16,412 --> 04:10:20,445
LAURA: I wanna try to time it so I avoid as many
as I can.

3644
04:10:20,445 --> 04:10:27,541
MATT: There are-- there's a small cluster that
comes by, and a couple of minor individual bodies

3645
04:10:27,541 --> 04:10:29,681
on this side. Make two dexterity saving throws.

3646
04:10:29,681 --> 04:10:34,144
LAURA: Okay, cool, cool, cool, tight, tight,
tight. Here we go, here we go, here we go.

3647
04:10:34,144 --> 04:10:36,137
Natural 20!

3648
04:10:36,137 --> 04:10:38,430
MARISHA: What's up?

3649
04:10:38,430 --> 04:10:43,392
LAURA: And that one's totally fine, too. That's a
29.

3650
04:10:43,392 --> 04:10:47,472
MATT: You just whip past, out of the grasp. You
hear the clacking of bones--

3651
04:10:47,472 --> 04:10:51,015
TALIESIN: I think with a natural 20, you could
steal jewelry from one of them as you went by,

3652
04:10:51,015 --> 04:10:52,593
like, that's a nice necklace.

3653
04:10:52,593 --> 04:10:55,010
MARISHA: Top Gun high-five!

3654
04:10:55,010 --> 04:11:03,550
MATT: You make it across to the other side. There,
you see Scanlan waiting, arms crossed, foot

3655
04:11:03,550 --> 04:11:11,025
tapping at an accelerated rate. Grog waiting,
finding another vase to throw, and all of a sudden

3656
04:11:11,025 --> 04:11:15,293
you watch as Vex comes streaming across and
eventually rights herself back up to your

3657
04:11:15,293 --> 04:11:17,516
position, her hair falling normally flat to her
side.

3658
04:11:17,516 --> 04:11:18,806
LAURA: Oh hey, guys.

3659
04:11:18,806 --> 04:11:20,704
MARISHA: And I give her a big high-five!

3660
04:11:20,704 --> 04:11:22,816
MATT: You don't, 'cause you're on the other side.

3661
04:11:22,816 --> 04:11:24,032
MARISHA: What?

3662
04:11:24,032 --> 04:11:27,487
LIAM: She made it one way, she's gotta go back the
other way.

3663
04:11:27,487 --> 04:11:30,894
MATT: Keyleth high-fives her from across the
ravine.

3664
04:11:30,894 --> 04:11:33,415
MARISHA: High-five, woo!

3665
04:11:33,415 --> 04:11:37,771
LIAM: Wait a minute. Are you saying this story
only exists in our imagination?

3666
04:11:37,771 --> 04:11:39,653
(laughter)

3667
04:11:39,653 --> 04:11:41,900
LAURA: Hey, Grog. Do you trust me?

3668
04:11:41,900 --> 04:11:43,258
TRAVIS: No.

3669
04:11:43,258 --> 04:11:45,140
LAURA: Do you wanna get in this necklace?

3670
04:11:45,140 --> 04:11:46,027
TRAVIS: Sure.

3671
04:11:46,027 --> 04:11:47,802
TALIESIN: He knows! Modify Memory.

3672
04:11:47,802 --> 04:11:49,366
(laughter)

3673
04:11:49,366 --> 04:11:50,749
TALIESIN: Back in the Matrix.

3674
04:11:50,749 --> 04:11:52,555
LAURA: And then Scanlan.

3675
04:11:52,555 --> 04:11:56,178
MATT: So Grog, a familiar sensation. Once you're
back in that chamber

3676
04:11:56,178 --> 04:11:58,043
I described to you once before.

3677
04:11:58,043 --> 04:12:05,173
LAURA: And Scanlan, I want him to affix himself to
this broom, like really tie him on here.

3678
04:12:05,173 --> 04:12:08,928
MATT: You go to get to the broom, and he just
latches onto the side of your leg.

3679
04:12:08,928 --> 04:12:10,825
"I'm fine here."

3680
04:12:10,825 --> 04:12:16,424
LAURA: I still tie some rope around. I've got the
Rope of Entanglement, I can at least wrap us up.

3681
04:12:16,424 --> 04:12:23,381
MATT: You actually magically restrain him with the
Rope of Entanglement, so he's bound in a spiral

3682
04:12:23,381 --> 04:12:29,891
fashion to the actual broom as you get on top of
it. Begin to cross to the other side? Okay. At

3683
04:12:29,891 --> 04:12:36,847
this point, you watch as another corpse tumbles
past, and looking downward, not a hand, but what

3684
04:12:36,847 --> 04:12:46,296
looks like a giant face emerging, built of various
pieces of zombified corpses and bones, the mouth

3685
04:12:46,296 --> 04:12:51,352
opening almost to try and swallow you as you zoom
over that way. Make two dexterity saving throws.

3686
04:12:51,352 --> 04:12:54,007
The first is against the singular zombie, lower
DC.

3687
04:12:54,007 --> 04:12:55,947
LIAM: Is she within 30 feet of me at this point?

3688
04:12:55,947 --> 04:13:01,199
MATT: She will be in just a moment. First one
she's not, second one she will be.

3689
04:13:01,199 --> 04:13:02,730
MARISHA: It's her and Pike?

3690
04:13:02,730 --> 04:13:04,417
MATT: No, it's her and Scanlan.

3691
04:13:04,417 --> 04:13:07,892
LAURA: The first one is-- I add my dexterity?

3692
04:13:07,892 --> 04:13:09,831
MATT: Correct. Or whatever your dexterity saving
throw is.

3693
04:13:09,831 --> 04:13:11,986
LAURA: Okay, that's a 26.

3694
04:13:11,986 --> 04:13:15,188
MATT: First one, you zip past without an issue,
and that's when you look down and notice the giant

3695
04:13:15,188 --> 04:13:17,390
face coming up. Second.

3696
04:13:17,390 --> 04:13:20,682
LIAM: Wait, she's within 30 feet of me now? I'm
Blessing her.

3697
04:13:20,682 --> 04:13:22,086
MATT: Okay.

3698
04:13:22,086 --> 04:13:23,951
TALIESIN: Scanlan is also inspiring her.

3699
04:13:23,951 --> 04:13:27,389
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good, though,
this is good. 27.

3700
04:13:27,389 --> 04:13:33,341
MATT: 27. The mouth comes up to try and slam shut
around you, and as it comes up, you just arc out

3701
04:13:33,341 --> 04:13:40,079
of the way. You guys watch as the jaw begins to
close, and just as these jutting pieces of broken

3702
04:13:40,079 --> 04:13:45,950
bone, skulls, and shoulderblades that make this
weird makeshift mouth of this entity begin to

3703
04:13:45,950 --> 04:13:50,408
close and slam shut, you watch as the broom just
barely catches out of the top of it, arcs

3704
04:13:50,408 --> 04:13:55,656
downward, and makes it across the way without
impact. Just as Vax finishes his Blessing spell on

3705
04:13:55,656 --> 04:14:00,840
her, you've all now made it across safely to the
other side of the ravine here.

3706
04:14:00,840 --> 04:14:02,887
MARISHA: Now I give her a high-five.

3707
04:14:02,887 --> 04:14:08,457
LAURA: I untie Scanlan and pop Grog out.

3708
04:14:08,457 --> 04:14:15,153
MATT: Grog, you're released. Trinket comes up to
you and starts licking the side of your face.

3709
04:14:15,153 --> 04:14:21,054
TRAVIS: That really seemed very easy. I don't see
what the big deal was.

3710
04:14:21,054 --> 04:14:24,047
(laughter)

3711
04:14:24,047 --> 04:14:29,227
TALIESIN: You want to try again? I know that
you're considering it reasonably.

3712
04:14:29,227 --> 04:14:31,916
MARISHA: Don't put these ideas in his head.

3713
04:14:31,916 --> 04:14:33,487
MATT: So, what are you guys doing?

3714
04:14:33,487 --> 04:14:35,713
LAURA: Move forward, I guess.

3715
04:14:35,713 --> 04:14:38,398
MATT: All right, so you push forward--

3716
04:14:38,398 --> 04:14:39,812
LAURA: Check for traps!

3717
04:14:39,812 --> 04:14:41,597
MATT: Check for traps, okay.

3718
04:14:41,597 --> 04:14:47,226
LIAM: Thank you. Thank for catching my sister,
thank you.

3719
04:14:47,226 --> 04:14:50,304
MATT: Investigation check.

3720
04:14:50,304 --> 04:14:51,905
LIAM: Checking for traps.

3721
04:14:51,905 --> 04:14:53,960
LAURA: Good, I hope you rolled well.

3722
04:14:53,960 --> 04:14:56,351
LIAM: I always roll well on this. 18.

3723
04:14:56,351 --> 04:14:57,915
LAURA: 'Cause I rolled a one again.

3724
04:14:57,915 --> 04:15:05,234
MATT: Wow. Better now than a moment ago. All
right, so. As you guys push forward into this dark

3725
04:15:05,234 --> 04:15:13,507
chamber, now, the humans, I imagine you still have
your warhammer out for light, Kerrek?

3726
04:15:13,507 --> 04:15:15,936
PATRICK: Yes.

3727
04:15:15,936 --> 04:15:20,907
MATT: So you have enough of a radius where you can
kind of make out the scenery and such. As you

3728
04:15:20,907 --> 04:15:27,829
progress forward about 45, 50 feet further down
this path, you see what looks to be a small

3729
04:15:27,829 --> 04:15:35,224
structure built into the ground, almost like a
multi-tiered statue of some kind, and you hear

3730
04:15:35,224 --> 04:15:39,587
what sounds like a very faint bit of trickling,
rushing water.

3731
04:15:39,587 --> 04:15:41,162
LIAM: Statue of a what, please?

3732
04:15:41,337 --> 04:15:49,502
MATT: You're not quite sure yet. As you approach,
you look at it, and it appears to be a fountain,

3733
04:15:49,502 --> 04:15:58,070
like a small structure that contains what would be
a bowl for water, and then a central, smaller tier

3734
04:15:58,070 --> 04:16:06,173
that opens up into a smaller bowl, and kind of a
jagged edge to it. It looks a little sinister. And

3735
04:16:06,173 --> 04:16:12,081
at the very top looks to be a humanoid face that's
stretched into this ghastly, horrified expression

3736
04:16:12,081 --> 04:16:22,606
of terror and gasp. From its mouth is pouring a
small trickle of water, but it is upward. And it's

3737
04:16:22,606 --> 04:16:29,863
just spilling onto the ceiling, where it's just
pooling and separating into cracks. The path

3738
04:16:29,863 --> 04:16:33,005
continues past it. It's just in the center of the
hallway.

3739
04:16:33,005 --> 04:16:34,573
TRAVIS: It's going up, but we're not.

3740
04:16:34,573 --> 04:16:35,803
MATT: Correct.

3741
04:16:35,803 --> 04:16:38,173
MARISHA: We're just not light enough.

3742
04:16:38,173 --> 04:16:40,756
TALIESIN: Or not close enough.

3743
04:16:40,756 --> 04:16:44,225
PATRICK: Or we're not in the area of effect, yet.

3744
04:16:44,225 --> 04:16:51,396
MARISHA: I reach down and I grab a little pebble
and toss it towards the fountain.

3745
04:16:51,396 --> 04:16:57,351
MATT: Okay. You toss it towards the fountain, the
pebble clinks. And the fountain is empty, it is

3746
04:16:57,351 --> 04:17:02,625
dry on the inside right now, on each of the lower
tiers, because the water that is being poured from

3747
04:17:02,625 --> 04:17:07,868
this face is trickling upward and hitting the
ceiling. It's this steady, constant stream.

3748
04:17:07,868 --> 04:17:09,573
MARISHA: Pebble.

3749
04:17:09,573 --> 04:17:14,372
MATT: You throw the pebble into the fountain, it
just kinda comes to rest.

3750
04:17:14,372 --> 04:17:15,949
TRAVIS: What's on the ceiling? Just flat?

3751
04:17:15,949 --> 04:17:21,151
MATT: It looks to be just a stone ceiling, and the
water's just hitting in one particular spot. If

3752
04:17:21,151 --> 04:17:24,161
you want to roll a perception check.

3753
04:17:24,161 --> 04:17:26,329
TRAVIS: 16.

3754
04:17:26,329 --> 04:17:31,483
MATT: Okay, you glance up, and from what little
bit you can see with your Darkvision, the water

3755
04:17:31,483 --> 04:17:38,549
appears to be impacting something that has a
different surface than the ceiling stonework. It's

3756
04:17:38,549 --> 04:17:41,797
smoother, shinier, it reflects a little bit of
light.

3757
04:17:41,797 --> 04:17:44,037
MARISHA: How high, roughly, is the ceiling?

3758
04:17:44,037 --> 04:17:47,862
MATT: It's about 15 feet up at this point.

3759
04:17:47,862 --> 04:17:49,392
MARISHA: Only 15?

3760
04:17:49,392 --> 04:17:50,833
LIAM: Is it a dead end?

3761
04:17:50,833 --> 04:17:54,283
MATT: No, the path continues past it. Just
straight.

3762
04:17:54,283 --> 04:17:59,182
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

3763
04:17:59,182 --> 04:18:02,393
TRAVIS: Well, we could pour a bunch of water in
the fountain.

3764
04:18:02,393 --> 04:18:05,620
TALIESIN: I don't know if we should touch the
water that's coming out of the fountain. I think

3765
04:18:05,620 --> 04:18:11,609
it's coming out of a petrified human that's been
turned into a mystical source of water, is the

3766
04:18:11,609 --> 04:18:12,978
vibe I'm getting.

3767
04:18:12,978 --> 04:18:15,512
TRAVIS: Oh, I just meant pour water out of the
alchemy jug.

3768
04:18:15,512 --> 04:18:17,680
LAURA: Like, into the fountain?

3769
04:18:17,680 --> 04:18:20,639
LIAM: I'd like to move along the edge of the room,
checking for traps ahead.

3770
04:18:20,639 --> 04:18:22,994
MATT: Okay. So Vax continues forward.

3771
04:18:22,994 --> 04:18:28,269
LIAM: 19.

3772
04:18:28,269 --> 04:18:36,006
MATT: Okay. So you coast ahead, keeping an eye
out. There are no traps, but you do sense that

3773
04:18:36,006 --> 04:18:39,906
there is some mechanism involved with this
fountain.

3774
04:18:39,906 --> 04:18:41,883
LIAM: I'm gonna stop where I am, then.

3775
04:18:41,883 --> 04:18:42,952
MATT: Okay.

3776
04:18:42,952 --> 04:18:52,084
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up the wall towards,
very gingerly, doing my best to check for traps or

3777
04:18:52,084 --> 04:18:54,866
anything unusual, towards whatever it is that the
water's hitting on the ceiling.

3778
04:18:54,866 --> 04:18:57,044
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

3779
04:18:57,044 --> 04:19:00,702
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

3780
04:19:00,702 --> 04:19:05,741
MATT: As you walk up the edge-- what's your actual
perception bonus?

3781
04:19:05,741 --> 04:19:08,776
TALIESIN: My perception? With my perception, 28.

3782
04:19:08,776 --> 04:19:13,181
MATT: Okay. You make it up to the top, and as you
glance in, you can see there's some sort of a

3783
04:19:13,181 --> 04:19:21,131
green emerald-like gem that is embedded into the
ceiling that the water is just trickling onto.

3784
04:19:21,131 --> 04:19:28,653
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the green emerald gem?
It's a green gem, or is it residuum?

3785
04:19:28,653 --> 04:19:35,280
MATT: No, no, it is not residuum, it is not
processed whitestone. It is an emerald-like gem,

3786
04:19:35,280 --> 04:19:41,174
although it is imperfect. It is not, you know, a
jeweler has not cut over it to make it a beautiful

3787
04:19:41,174 --> 04:19:42,603
gem. It is a little rough.

3788
04:19:42,603 --> 04:19:50,937
TALIESIN: And the water is hitting that gem.

3789
04:19:50,937 --> 04:19:53,681
MATT: It's hitting the gem and it's kind of just
pooling around it and sifting into cracks and

3790
04:19:53,681 --> 04:19:55,781
being drawn.

3791
04:19:55,781 --> 04:20:04,620
TALIESIN: I'm feeling the urge to fuck with this.
I'm really hoping someone tells me not to.

3792
04:20:04,620 --> 04:20:07,462
LAURA: Probably maybe leave it?

3793
04:20:07,462 --> 04:20:09,046
LIAM: Wait half a minute, half a minute.

3794
04:20:09,046 --> 04:20:14,399
TALIESIN: I'm going to edge towards it gently, and
I'm actually-- this is going to sound weird-- I'm

3795
04:20:14,399 --> 04:20:17,893
going to spit at it to see at what range my spit
decides to move towards it.

3796
04:20:17,893 --> 04:20:24,936
MATT: Okay. So you spit at it, and your spit still
kinda arcs downward, normal gravity, then it hits

3797
04:20:24,936 --> 04:20:26,728
the water and just gets caught up in the water.

3798
04:20:26,728 --> 04:20:30,849
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's the water itself that's
being-- something maybe in the fountain?

3799
04:20:30,849 --> 04:20:34,753
MARISHA: Can I do an investigation? Can I do a
closer look at the fountain?

3800
04:20:34,753 --> 04:20:36,412
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.

3801
04:20:36,412 --> 04:20:40,031
MARISHA: Man, I hate investigating.

3802
04:20:40,031 --> 04:20:42,249
LIAM: What's the light like?

3803
04:20:42,249 --> 04:20:46,941
MATT: There is no light in this room, other than
the source of Kerr's hammer.

3804
04:20:46,941 --> 04:20:50,593
MARISHA: 20 total on the fountain. 20.

3805
04:20:50,593 --> 04:20:58,445
MATT: 20 on the fountain, okay. There is, best you
can tell, some magical source. This is connected

3806
04:20:58,445 --> 04:21:00,929
to something. You're not entirely sure what.

3807
04:21:00,929 --> 04:21:02,974
MARISHA: No gems? I don't see any gems?

3808
04:21:02,974 --> 04:21:05,996
MATT: I mean, you see-- there's no gems based
inside the actual fountain itself.

3809
04:21:05,996 --> 04:21:07,027
The only gem that's--

3810
04:21:07,027 --> 04:21:08,497
MARISHA: Something magical about the fountain.

3811
04:21:08,497 --> 04:21:10,271
MATT: Yes. There is a magical essence to it.

3812
04:21:10,271 --> 04:21:18,766
PATRICK: I will do it if nobody else wants to. Can
you catch some of the water

3813
04:21:18,766 --> 04:21:21,722
in a jar or container?

3814
04:21:21,722 --> 04:21:24,552
MATT: Yeah, if you want to.

3815
04:21:24,552 --> 04:21:30,944
PATRICK: 'Cause I look around, I don't want to
disrupt anything, but I'll just catch a little in

3816
04:21:30,944 --> 04:21:35,900
a bottle. Once it's in the bottle, does it still
pull upward?

3817
04:21:35,900 --> 04:21:41,111
MATT: Once you pull it in the bottle, it rests
back into regular gravity.

3818
04:21:41,111 --> 04:21:43,594
PATRICK: Does it just smell like regular water?

3819
04:21:43,594 --> 04:21:51,714
MATT: It smells... it smells very stagnant. Hard
water-ish, like Pirates of the Caribbean or It's a

3820
04:21:51,714 --> 04:21:53,022
Small World.

3821
04:21:53,022 --> 04:21:54,463
LAURA: Gross.

3822
04:21:54,463 --> 04:22:04,275
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's not the clearest of
Arrowhead. It's cold.

3823
04:22:04,275 --> 04:22:06,600
MARISHA: I mean, we could have Scanlan do a Dispel
Magic on it.

3824
04:22:06,600 --> 04:22:08,263
LAURA: Yeah.

3825
04:22:08,263 --> 04:22:14,392
MARISHA: Dispel the fountain. Or the gem. Or I
could carve the gem out of the ceiling.

3826
04:22:14,392 --> 04:22:18,908
TALIESIN: I'm standing next to the gem. I can pry
it out of the ceiling if we have to.

3827
04:22:18,908 --> 04:22:20,542
MARISHA: But that means you have to touch it.

3828
04:22:20,542 --> 04:22:23,900
LIAM: What can I see down the way I'm looking?

3829
04:22:23,900 --> 04:22:31,525
MATT: You, looking ahead, the tunnel continues and
you're starting to see more and more of the

3830
04:22:31,525 --> 04:22:36,083
essence of reclaimed stonework. You can see,
whereas previously this ravine was an actual

3831
04:22:36,083 --> 04:22:45,913
semi-natural tunnel that pushed forward, the walls
begin to get more brick-like. It's looking more

3832
04:22:45,913 --> 04:22:56,322
and more like a really, really old, for lack of a
better term, temple or structure where you can see

3833
04:22:56,322 --> 04:22:59,601
there was care put into its design.

3834
04:22:59,601 --> 04:23:06,325
LIAM: Okay. So the statue's in this semi-natural
chamber. And turns into more carved-out,

3835
04:23:06,325 --> 04:23:07,467
civilized.

3836
04:23:07,467 --> 04:23:16,865
TALIESIN: I might run down to Grog. Do you have a
spare jar or jug that I can borrow?

3837
04:23:16,865 --> 04:23:18,546
TRAVIS: I do. What do you want for it?

3838
04:23:18,546 --> 04:23:21,157
TALIESIN: I just want to borrow it for like five
minutes, and I'll give it back.

3839
04:23:21,157 --> 04:23:22,578
TRAVIS: What you got for trade?

3840
04:23:22,578 --> 04:23:25,158
(laughter)

3841
04:23:25,158 --> 04:23:32,359
TALIESIN: I have nothing--

3842
04:23:32,359 --> 04:23:34,136
TRAVIS: Is that an ascot you're wearing?

3843
04:23:34,136 --> 04:23:35,685
TALIESIN: Yes, it is.

3844
04:23:35,685 --> 04:23:37,014
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

3845
04:23:37,014 --> 04:23:39,488
TALIESIN: It won't even fit around your neck.

3846
04:23:39,488 --> 04:23:40,954
TRAVIS: I don't care. I want it.

3847
04:23:40,954 --> 04:23:42,270
TALIESIN: Do you know how to tie an ascot?

3848
04:23:42,270 --> 04:23:43,953
TRAVIS: I want to be dignified.

3849
04:23:43,953 --> 04:23:45,671
MARISHA: I can teach you later, Grog.

3850
04:23:45,671 --> 04:24:01,912
TALIESIN: Oh, that alone. That's adorable. I tie a
little Dickie's first day of school Christmas bow.

3851
04:24:01,912 --> 04:24:05,639
And I take my little pin and I pin it on him.

3852
04:24:05,639 --> 04:24:06,859
TRAVIS: Here's your jug.

3853
04:24:06,859 --> 04:24:07,981
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3854
04:24:07,981 --> 04:24:10,418
(laughter)

3855
04:24:10,418 --> 04:24:18,025
TALIESIN: And I go walking back up. I have a
theory that maybe if we cover the green gem, that

3856
04:24:18,025 --> 04:24:21,506
might do a thing, so if we start to cross and
everything goes weird, I'm going to cover the

3857
04:24:21,506 --> 04:24:22,551
green gem.

3858
04:24:22,551 --> 04:24:23,579
LIAM: Hey, for science.

3859
04:24:23,579 --> 04:24:27,379
TALIESIN: For science. But let's try and leave
this room without doing anything, maybe.

3860
04:24:27,379 --> 04:24:29,041
LIAM: Besides what you're doing?

3861
04:24:29,041 --> 04:24:30,924
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna do anything unless
something happens.

3862
04:24:30,924 --> 04:24:32,350
TRAVIS: How high is the ceiling?

3863
04:24:32,350 --> 04:24:33,216
MATT: 15 feet.

3864
04:24:33,216 --> 04:24:34,276
TRAVIS: Okay.

3865
04:24:34,276 --> 04:24:40,745
MARISHA: Hey, Grog. If it comes to that. Don't
worry about it.

3866
04:24:40,745 --> 04:24:41,952
MATT: So what's the plan?

3867
04:24:41,952 --> 04:24:45,806
LIAM: Scootch forward, to the other side, looking
for traps, looking for traps.

3868
04:24:45,806 --> 04:24:47,453
MATT: Okay, you continue to scootch forward.

3869
04:24:47,453 --> 04:24:48,893
MARISHA: I stay with Grog and Percy.

3870
04:24:48,893 --> 04:24:50,593
LAURA: I stand in between.

3871
04:24:50,593 --> 04:24:54,941
MATT: Okay, so you guys stay back there. Okay,
Kima and Allura stay back, waiting for you guys to

3872
04:24:54,941 --> 04:24:59,353
scout as well. Okay. You guys, make stealth checks
again.

3873
04:24:59,353 --> 04:25:04,702
LAURA: I'm scared of all my dice right now. Just,
all of them.

3874
04:25:04,702 --> 04:25:07,995
LIAM: 30.

3875
04:25:07,995 --> 04:25:09,319
LAURA: 17.

3876
04:25:09,319 --> 04:25:18,414
MATT: Okay. You guys begin to very, very slowly
make your way up ahead, and you watch as the path

3877
04:25:18,414 --> 04:25:25,519
ahead of you begins to-- the ceiling begins to
grow higher and higher, and the hall begins to

3878
04:25:25,519 --> 04:25:32,043
widen open a little bit, and begins to split in
two directions, like all of a sudden the tunnel

3879
04:25:32,043 --> 04:25:37,295
breaks into two different paths, with the ceiling
rising and growing wider on each of those paths as

3880
04:25:37,295 --> 04:25:42,606
it presses forward. You're starting to see
portions of it are still the cavern-type feel, but

3881
04:25:42,606 --> 04:25:46,367
once again, you're seeing more and more sections
where it looks like all these walls at one point

3882
04:25:46,367 --> 04:25:54,981
were carved stone and had a specific purpose, and
then over time, once again, portions of it have

3883
04:25:54,981 --> 04:25:56,774
fallen to disuse and ruin.

3884
04:25:56,774 --> 04:25:58,455
TALIESIN: So nothing-- the fountain did nothing?

3885
04:25:58,455 --> 04:26:00,574
MATT: Currently not yet, no.

3886
04:26:00,574 --> 04:26:04,608
LIAM: Fuck a duck. We've got a fork in the road.
What do you want to do?

3887
04:26:04,608 --> 04:26:07,335
TALIESIN: Let's bring everyone towards you now. Is
it time?

3888
04:26:07,335 --> 04:26:11,194
LIAM: Well, there's nothing immediately
dangerous-appearing.

3889
04:26:11,194 --> 04:26:15,651
LAURA: I'm gonna try to focus on dragons again and
see if I can figure out which direction they are.

3890
04:26:15,651 --> 04:26:18,254
MATT: Okay, so you use another spell slot.

3891
04:26:18,254 --> 04:26:21,450
TRAVIS: We don't wanna pour anything into the
fountain?

3892
04:26:21,450 --> 04:26:22,747
TALIESIN: I don't--

3893
04:26:22,747 --> 04:26:28,424
TRAVIS: We did nothing to this thing that's right
here, magically pouring water out.

3894
04:26:28,424 --> 04:26:31,348
TALIESIN: It might just be the equivalent of a big
red button.

3895
04:26:31,348 --> 04:26:33,554
TRAVIS: I love buttons.

3896
04:26:33,554 --> 04:26:35,660
TALIESIN: The world loves buttons.

3897
04:26:35,660 --> 04:26:37,885
LAURA: It's up to you, Grog.

3898
04:26:37,885 --> 04:26:40,935
TALIESIN: You have a jar of unending water if you
wanted to--

3899
04:26:40,935 --> 04:26:49,613
MATT: Vex. The sources are still ahead of you.
They're still present and still in the direction

3900
04:26:49,613 --> 04:26:51,021
you guys are facing.

3901
04:26:51,021 --> 04:26:54,719
LAURA: Do I know which fork they're down?

3902
04:26:54,719 --> 04:26:57,384
MATT: In that direction.

3903
04:26:57,384 --> 04:27:04,057
LIAM: I'd also like to use my last instance of
Divine Sense here, at this fork in the road.

3904
04:27:04,057 --> 04:27:14,588
MATT: 60-foot radius up there... no. There is no
sense of anything undead, fiendish, celestial.

3905
04:27:14,588 --> 04:27:17,796
MARISHA: Nothing? No sway?

3906
04:27:17,796 --> 04:27:21,954
MATT: Not where they currently are, no. What are
you guys doing?

3907
04:27:21,954 --> 04:27:25,636
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for everyone else to-- I'm
circling to the other side of the green--

3908
04:27:25,636 --> 04:27:28,814
LIAM: Are we all gathering up at this fork in the
road?

3909
04:27:28,814 --> 04:27:30,801
TALIESIN: Yeah, if everyone's gonna cross the
room.

3910
04:27:30,801 --> 04:27:36,191
MATT: Okay. So you just move on? Okay. You guys
continue and gather at the edge of this fork. You

3911
04:27:36,191 --> 04:27:44,889
can see a very, very faint bit of light coming
from both sides of the fork, just glancing off a

3912
04:27:44,889 --> 04:27:47,340
distant opposite cave wall.

3913
04:27:47,340 --> 04:27:49,523
MARISHA: Both have light?

3914
04:27:49,523 --> 04:27:55,143
MATT: Both have a very, very faint bit of a light
source. Two of you guys make, since you were up

3915
04:27:55,143 --> 04:27:57,474
front first, make perception checks, if you
could.

3916
04:27:57,474 --> 04:28:04,704
LIAM: Bupkis for me.

3917
04:28:04,704 --> 04:28:06,077
LAURA: 24.

3918
04:28:06,077 --> 04:28:17,593
MATT: 24? Glancing both ways, for you, it splits
off, and they both seem to curve around in almost

3919
04:28:17,593 --> 04:28:23,448
like a rejoining direction, or at least, they get
close to it. The split is less of a split and more

3920
04:28:23,448 --> 04:28:28,762
that there is just a large column of earth that
splits what would be a wide path. The two paths

3921
04:28:28,762 --> 04:28:31,549
eventually seem to join again on the other side.

3922
04:28:31,549 --> 04:28:33,801
LAURA: And there's a little bit of light coming
from the end of it?

3923
04:28:33,801 --> 04:28:35,989
MATT: A little bit of light source. Apparently on
the other side of whatever this pillar would be,

3924
04:28:35,989 --> 04:28:42,001
or at the other side of each of these different
paths, that it's just barely reflecting off of the

3925
04:28:42,001 --> 04:28:46,042
cave walls, enough for it to give you the essence
that there is light further.

3926
04:28:46,042 --> 04:28:52,387
LIAM: Should we all trot along, or should we send
us down?

3927
04:28:52,387 --> 04:28:58,040
LAURA: Trap? You wanna look for traps? The dragons
are still in there. Just ahead.

3928
04:28:58,040 --> 04:29:02,183
LIAM: This could be it, although we thought it
could be it twice at least.

3929
04:29:02,183 --> 04:29:05,425
MARISHA: Do we wanna split the party, half one
way, half the other?

3930
04:29:05,425 --> 04:29:07,235
LAURA: No, let's all stay on one side.

3931
04:29:07,235 --> 04:29:14,201
TALIESIN: If the water were running, which
direction would the water be running down? Like,

3932
04:29:14,201 --> 04:29:19,420
if the fountain filled-- this is just, I'm trying
to conjecture, I feel like the fountain's gonna

3933
04:29:19,420 --> 04:29:21,260
irritate me for the rest of the god damn night.

3934
04:29:21,260 --> 04:29:22,886
MARISHA: We can Dispel Magic the fountain.

3935
04:29:22,886 --> 04:29:29,143
LAURA: It could just be like this could be a water
canal that we're looking at right now.

3936
04:29:29,143 --> 04:29:33,825
MARISHA: I could also get rid of that gem. We have
options for dealing with that fountain.

3937
04:29:33,825 --> 04:29:35,098
TALIESIN: Do it?

3938
04:29:35,098 --> 04:29:36,817
LIAM: Well, I mean, if it's itching.

3939
04:29:36,817 --> 04:29:42,292
PATRICK: I will say, a lot of the things that
we've touched here have been put there to hurt us

3940
04:29:42,292 --> 04:29:43,724
if we touch them.

3941
04:29:43,724 --> 04:29:44,865
TALIESIN: Touche.

3942
04:29:44,865 --> 04:29:54,142
PATRICK: But also, the skull that we left behind
ambushed us, so it seems to be a horse apiece in

3943
04:29:54,142 --> 04:29:55,700
terms of a pattern, here.

3944
04:29:55,700 --> 04:30:00,918
TALIESIN: I figure, I think, if you've made it
this far, that you've not touched several things

3945
04:30:00,918 --> 04:30:05,868
at this point, so. This is so obviously a-- I
know.

3946
04:30:05,868 --> 04:30:09,552
MARISHA: I mean, if it's just a trap then it's
just a trap and we avoided it and we moved on.

3947
04:30:09,552 --> 04:30:14,160
LIAM: All right, look, we've got two identical
passages. Do you want to flip a coin? Or can you

3948
04:30:14,160 --> 04:30:15,744
see any benefit to either side?

3949
04:30:15,744 --> 04:30:19,498
LAURA: It looks like they come back together. This
is just a giant separation thing.

3950
04:30:19,498 --> 04:30:21,332
LIAM: Flip a coin?

3951
04:30:21,332 --> 04:30:23,679
LAURA: Oh, but I have an actual coin.

3952
04:30:23,679 --> 04:30:26,794
LIAM: Do you? Pull it out. Come on, treasurer.

3953
04:30:26,794 --> 04:30:27,973
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3954
04:30:27,973 --> 04:30:30,090
LIAM: We're picking a passageway.

3955
04:30:30,090 --> 04:30:32,762
MATT: What are these guys doing? Are you catching
up with them?

3956
04:30:32,762 --> 04:30:36,390
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll start walking towards them.

3957
04:30:36,390 --> 04:30:37,776
MARISHA: I hang back with Grog.

3958
04:30:37,776 --> 04:30:39,014
MATT: Okay.

3959
04:30:39,014 --> 04:30:44,534
MARISHA: Grog. What do you think, man?

3960
04:30:44,534 --> 04:30:51,296
TRAVIS: I just feel like, I don't know, nothing
more sad than an empty fountain.

3961
04:30:51,296 --> 04:30:54,291
MARISHA: What do you want to do, you want to fill
it with water?

3962
04:30:54,291 --> 04:31:00,244
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, I feel like that's what a
fountain does. I mean, like, if you came across an

3963
04:31:00,244 --> 04:31:03,433
empty fountain, kind of a worthless thing.

3964
04:31:03,433 --> 04:31:07,362
MARISHA: Do you think a full fountain would help
our case in this instance?

3965
04:31:07,362 --> 04:31:10,795
TRAVIS: I dunno.

3966
04:31:10,795 --> 04:31:16,071
MARISHA: We can try it. Do you want to fill it
with water?

3967
04:31:16,071 --> 04:31:19,525
TRAVIS: Yeah, kinda.

3968
04:31:19,525 --> 04:31:25,616
MARISHA: All right. I support this endeavor if you
want to do it, Grog.

3969
04:31:25,616 --> 04:31:30,474
TALIESIN: I hear this over the ears, and I'm gonna
slowly crawl, not too close back--

3970
04:31:30,474 --> 04:31:33,671
MATT: Allura and Kima are, "Um, are you certain
you want to do this?"

3971
04:31:33,671 --> 04:31:36,682
LIAM: Do what, now? Do what, now?

3972
04:31:36,682 --> 04:31:40,431
TRAVIS: Allura, it's just an empty fountain,
right? It's gotta have a purpose.

3973
04:31:40,431 --> 04:31:43,897
MATT: "Right. Do you know whether the purpose is a
good or a bad one?"

3974
04:31:43,897 --> 04:31:48,687
TRAVIS: I never really get that far.

3975
04:31:48,687 --> 04:31:53,184
MATT: "I know you've survived thus far on that
mindset. That's surprising,

3976
04:31:53,184 --> 04:31:55,870
"but do what you will, just--"

3977
04:31:55,870 --> 04:32:01,059
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I have a theory, now. Never
mind, I don't want to fuck with it anymore.

3978
04:32:01,059 --> 04:32:06,982
TRAVIS: Allura, you're all smart with magic and
stuff. Why is this horribly terrified face giving

3979
04:32:06,982 --> 04:32:09,610
water upwards on an emerald in the ceiling?

3980
04:32:09,610 --> 04:32:11,591
MARISHA: She rolled good.

3981
04:32:11,591 --> 04:32:20,985
MATT: She takes a moment, kind of steps forward
and looks at it. "Let me see one of your jugs."

3982
04:32:20,985 --> 04:32:23,361
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. What do you want for it?

3983
04:32:23,361 --> 04:32:24,636
TALIESIN: I hand her my jug.

3984
04:32:24,636 --> 04:32:26,865
(laughter)

3985
04:32:26,865 --> 04:32:42,635
MATT: She takes it, sets the jug right in the
stream, and releases it, and the jug sucks up and

3986
04:32:42,635 --> 04:32:47,623
essentially covers the gem, and the water just
kinda spills across the sides.

3987
04:32:47,623 --> 04:32:49,267
MARISHA: And then what?

3988
04:32:49,267 --> 04:32:54,378
MATT: "Huh. My theory was wrong."

3989
04:32:54,378 --> 04:33:01,076
MARISHA: What? Hang on, what was your theory?
Maybe we can do process of elimination.

3990
04:33:01,076 --> 04:33:03,544
MATT: "Well, I was trying to--" And you hear in
the distance, behind where you guys came from

3991
04:33:03,544 --> 04:33:06,218
(impact sounds).

3992
04:33:06,218 --> 04:33:08,142
TALIESIN: I'm moving right now.

3993
04:33:08,142 --> 04:33:16,845
MATT: What sounds like many, many, many things
falling, cracking, impacting.

3994
04:33:16,845 --> 04:33:20,101
MARISHA: Hey, Allura, good theory. Let's run.
Let's run.

3995
04:33:20,101 --> 04:33:21,848
TRAVIS: We are running towards Vax and Vex.

3996
04:33:21,848 --> 04:33:26,771
PATRICK: It just reversed the gravity in the
ravine.

3997
04:33:26,772 --> 04:33:31,285
MATT: Which, as Kerrek says this and you all look
back, you watch as hundreds and hundreds and

3998
04:33:31,285 --> 04:33:38,340
hundreds and hundreds of bodies are now tumbling
back down into the ravine below

3999
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:39,871
from where they came.

4000
04:33:39,871 --> 04:33:42,034
LIAM: Turn down for what!

4001
04:33:42,034 --> 04:33:45,979
(laughter)

4002
04:33:45,979 --> 04:33:50,107
TRAVIS: That was so white. That was amazing.

4003
04:33:50,107 --> 04:33:51,687
TALIESIN: We can make it whiter.

4004
04:33:51,687 --> 04:33:53,009
TRAVIS: So white.

4005
04:33:53,009 --> 04:33:54,706
MATT: Don't make this any whiter, please.

4006
04:33:54,706 --> 04:33:55,894
LIAM: Guilty.

4007
04:33:55,895 --> 04:33:57,650
(laughter)

4008
04:33:57,650 --> 04:34:07,117
TRAVIS: Piano riff!

4009
04:34:07,117 --> 04:34:11,182
TALIESIN: I may play Dungeons and Dragons on the
internet, but now I'm embarrassed.

4010
04:34:11,183 --> 04:34:19,411
MATT: The water's still going up, and it's still
careening and falling through the cracks. It's not

4011
04:34:19,411 --> 04:34:25,026
a very strong stream, it's just this-- like a
small faucet turned on, it's all just trickling

4012
04:34:25,026 --> 04:34:28,851
upwards, appearing, but that gem being currently
blocked seems to have had

4013
04:34:28,851 --> 04:34:30,952
an effect on the room behind.

4014
04:34:30,953 --> 04:34:32,394
TALIESIN: Good to know.

4015
04:34:32,394 --> 04:34:37,617
TRAVIS: To the right or the left?

4016
04:34:37,617 --> 04:34:38,906
LAURA: To the right!

4017
04:34:38,907 --> 04:34:40,744
LIAM: Going to the right, but hold on.

4018
04:34:40,744 --> 04:34:42,307
MATT: Same marching order as before?

4019
04:34:42,308 --> 04:34:49,007
LIAM: I'm gonna go a little bit ahead, 20 feet
ahead, looking for traps. I doubt, but I want to

4020
04:34:49,007 --> 04:34:52,011
check for traps. Stealth and traps, stealth and
traps.

4021
04:34:52,011 --> 04:34:53,846
MATT: You're still on the same stealth roll you
had before.

4022
04:34:53,847 --> 04:34:58,044
LIAM: Okay, great. So traps, investigation is 18.

4023
04:34:58,044 --> 04:35:04,189
MATT: Okay. The floor doesn't appear to be trapped
as you coast forward around the other side.

4024
04:35:04,189 --> 04:35:06,178
LAURA: Check the ceiling. I look at the ceiling.

4025
04:35:06,179 --> 04:35:14,679
MATT: It looks like a ceiling. It's about 25, 30
feet in height throughout this chamber.

4026
04:35:14,679 --> 04:35:19,836
LIAM: And as we move through this passage, what do
we see as we get closer to it?

4027
04:35:19,836 --> 04:35:30,858
MATT: As you curve around, you notice that the
rocky walls become just stone. You see these grey

4028
04:35:30,858 --> 04:35:40,007
brick walls that begin to turn as you turn around,
you see a faint light source from a series of

4029
04:35:40,007 --> 04:35:47,343
candleabras that mark the edges of this
square-like chamber. There are two distant cages

4030
04:35:47,343 --> 04:35:56,282
in the far corners that seem to bear some sort of
slumped, unmoving bodies inside them. There are

4031
04:35:56,282 --> 04:36:02,185
two pillars in the center of the room that appear
to be just strewn with carvings and glyphs from

4032
04:36:02,185 --> 04:36:12,717
top to bottom, surrounding them entirely. Two
large scaled, crimson eggs lie placed against one

4033
04:36:12,717 --> 04:36:20,851
side of the wall, seemingly untouched, and on the
right-hand side of the chamber, at the base of one

4034
04:36:20,851 --> 04:36:29,993
of these cages, you see a withered and long-dead
corpse of Thordak the Cinderking, folded and

4035
04:36:29,993 --> 04:36:37,676
sagging. You see a tome propped up against a
bookstand on the far end, marked by a singular

4036
04:36:37,677 --> 04:36:46,669
page, where a series of bookshelves and chains
line the walls of this apparent laboratory. You

4037
04:36:46,669 --> 04:36:56,421
see at the current opened tome across the way,
arms crossed, and reading quietly, a tall female

4038
04:36:56,421 --> 04:37:09,209
with dark green hair and silver, shimmery-like
skin facing away from you.

4039
04:37:09,210 --> 04:37:10,989
And we'll pick up for that next week.

4040
04:37:10,989 --> 04:37:12,152
MARISHA: I knew it.

4041
04:37:12,152 --> 04:37:16,216
MATT: 'Cause it is late. Patrick, are you gonna
join us for Skype next week?

4042
04:37:16,217 --> 04:37:18,147
MARISHA: Or in LA?

4043
04:37:18,147 --> 04:37:32,047
PATRICK: Actually, I am coming out to LA. It's an
issue of how quickly I'll be able to get to PAX

4044
04:37:32,047 --> 04:37:33,309
afterwards.

4045
04:37:33,310 --> 04:37:34,455
MATT: Oh, shit!

4046
04:37:34,455 --> 04:37:42,434
PATRICK: 'Cause I'm doing PAX South after my LA
trip. Really hoping that I will be in your neck of

4047
04:37:42,435 --> 04:37:50,371
the woods Thursday night. If not, if you want me
around for the finish, I would happily Skype in

4048
04:37:50,371 --> 04:37:56,675
from San Antonio or wherever that is. Up to you.

4049
04:37:56,675 --> 04:37:58,660
LAURA: Ash might be able to Skype in, too.

4050
04:37:58,660 --> 04:38:02,841
MATT: Dual Skype, maybe. Well, let us know, please
do.

4051
04:38:02,841 --> 04:38:05,004
PATRICK: I would be delighted.

4052
04:38:05,004 --> 04:38:10,182
TALIESIN: Thank you for handling Skype so well. It
is not easy to be on the other side of that

4053
04:38:10,182 --> 04:38:11,550
camera. It's so frustrating.

4054
04:38:11,550 --> 04:38:18,611
PATRICK: It's certainly not as nice as being up
close and personal with you all, but I'm just glad

4055
04:38:18,611 --> 04:38:24,429
that I am not experiencing vast technical eras--
eras, yes, errors.

4056
04:38:24,429 --> 04:38:29,338
LIAM: Well, we're glad to have you.

4057
04:38:29,338 --> 04:38:32,040
MATT: Yeah, thanks so much. All right, well we'll
be--

4058
04:38:32,040 --> 04:38:33,872
LAURA: Thanks for saving us, Kerr!

4059
04:38:33,872 --> 04:38:37,519
PATRICK: (laughs) There was a delightful amount of
mutual saving.

4060
04:38:37,519 --> 04:38:45,174
MARISHA: And, as always, don't forget to tune in
for Talks Machina on Tuesday night with Brian

4061
04:38:45,174 --> 04:38:52,320
Foster. I'm sure he's going to have at least two
of us.

4062
04:38:52,320 --> 04:38:59,568
MATT: That will be announced as the week
progresses.

4063
04:38:59,568 --> 04:39:04,169
MARISHA: Throughout the week, I'm sure, he will
announce two of us.

4064
04:39:04,169 --> 04:39:09,617
MATT: Also, as a heads-up, guys, once again, big
thank you to Loot Crate for being our fantastic

4065
04:39:09,617 --> 04:39:15,527
sponsor starting in the new year. They were
awesome enough to let us tonight be the first to

4066
04:39:15,527 --> 04:39:21,535
announce their February theme, as their previous
theme ended. The theme is 'build' for this one,

4067
04:39:21,536 --> 04:39:27,624
and the brands that are included in that include
Power Rangers, Batman, Lego, Tetris, things that

4068
04:39:27,624 --> 04:39:32,492
involve building, construct, that type of a feel,
so more information will be coming out with that,

4069
04:39:32,492 --> 04:39:36,250
but 'build' is the next theme. Check out
lootcrate.com for the full reveal of everything

4070
04:39:36,251 --> 04:39:40,136
they're gonna have in there, and don't forget to
use the promo code 'criticalrole', one word, for

4071
04:39:40,136 --> 04:39:41,799
the discount when you sign up.

4072
04:39:41,799 --> 04:39:43,554
(cheering)

4073
04:39:43,554 --> 04:39:46,950
MARISHA: I hope they got those Tetris stickers
