1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:08,734
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons and can't listen to a count

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:13,764
off screen when we're going to go live. But I
appreciate the effort guys.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,997
LIAM: Nobody could hear me say, "Scaramucci, I fucked
up."

5
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:24,697
MATT: I did. Don't do that. His life's hard enough
right now. All right. Anyway, bringing this back

6
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:28,857
in, thank you for joining us. We'll pick up here
in a minute for the actual story, but first we

7
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:37,402
have some quick announcements. No, not Siri.
Announcements. Come on. She's all right. First and

8
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:43,304
foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by our
friends at Puzzle Quest. Magic: the Gathering.

10
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:52,578

Puzzle Quest is our sponsor I do a little quiz

21
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:51,026
with Taliesin. Today I'm going to throw it to Liam
O'Brien, just to mix it up. The theme of tonight's

22
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:58,839
quiz is: Is this a Magic: the Gathering card or a
Kama Sutra position?

23
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:03,568
(laughter)

24
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:05,121
SAM: Black Lotus.

25
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:06,924
LIAM: That is Kama Sutra.

26
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:09,319
SAM: That is Magic: the Gathering.

27
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,179
MARISHA: A classic! That is the world's most
famous Magic: the Gathering card!

28
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:17,292
SAM: Reverse cowgirl.

29
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:19,630
LIAM: Magic: the Gathering.

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,399
MATT: Strangely, yeah. White deck.

31
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,360
SAM: She Wolf.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,512
LIAM: She Wolf is Magic: the Gathering.

33
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,310
SAM: No, that's--

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,647
LIAM: God damn it!

35
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:29,947
(laughter)

36
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,282
SAM: Lone Wolf.

37
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:35,302
LIAM: That's Magic: the Gathering. I'm just doing
B on every question.

38
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:38,791
SAM: Illicit Auction.

39
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,967
LIAM: That's Magic: the Gathering.

40
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:44,491
SAM: You're correct! The Angry Pirate.

41
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,867
LIAM: That's a Sam Riegel original.

42
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:55,814
SAM: That's a Kama Sutra. Correct, Liam O'Brien.
Maybe two more. Two more. The Curled Angel.

43
00:02:55,814 --> 00:03:01,027
LIAM: That's so close to another phrase. Let's
call that the Kama Sutra.

44
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,859
SAM: Correct! The Mud Hole.

45
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,653
LIAM: (high voice) Magic: the Gathering?

46
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:08,599
SAM: Correct!

47
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,086
(cheering)

48
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:14,052
SAM: The last one, last one: Excavation.

49
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,669
LIAM: Ew!

50
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:16,896
SAM: It's both.

51
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,958
(laughter)

52
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,726
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest! No! Magic: the Gathering
- Puzzle Quest

53
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:29,133
MATT: Yay, Puzzle Quest! This time Magic. Well
done, Sam. Well done, Liam!

54
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:34,013
TRAVIS: I was educated.

55
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:39,806
MATT: All right, moving on. Laura, we had 
some updates you said as far as merch goes?

56
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,162
LAURA: Merchandise!

57
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:43,178
TRAVIS: She's playing with her giant trash bag
of dice.

58
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:48,819
LAURA: I just finished organizing it, you guys.
Okay. I wanted to give you guys some updates on

59
00:03:48,819 --> 00:04:00,465
some merch items. Those amazing posters? They will
be sent out in a week. I think. Yes. They will be

60
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:07,028
sent out in a week, because they're in the
warehouse now, ready to get shipped. I've gotten a

61
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:11,542
lot of messages asking where are the aprons? And
the reason that they're not shipped yet is because

62
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:17,347
we ended up selling so many that the manufacturer
didn't have enough cloth to make the aprons, so

63
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:22,075
then there was a backlog of that. So they're
done, and they're about to get to the warehouse so

64
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:26,815
you'll be getting your aprons in a couple weeks,
and then we'll start getting them, so that's

65
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:33,241
solid. Also, we have these awesome necklaces.
Also, some other stuff.

66
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,765
SAM: Nice and vague.

67
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:44,226
MATT: Things are there. (laughs) Thank you, Laura.
Let's see, next up. GenCon live. We are at the

68
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:48,614
tail end of any available tickets for the show. So
if you haven't got one yet and you're still

69
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:55,246
planning to be around or near Indianapolis for
GenCon and want to come see, get it quickly. We're

70
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:59,171
about to close that out. Looking forward to seeing
everyone there who's coming, it's going to be fun

71
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:05,496
and depending on the next couple episodes, I'm real
curious to where it ends up when we get to

72
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,532
GenCon.

73
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:09,072
LAURA: So it's going to be a canon episode?

74
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:11,220
MATT: Oh, it's a canon episode. It's going to be
the next episode.

75
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,632
LAURA: What if we all die at the live show?

76
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:20,097
SAM: If one of us dies tonight, do we not go to
GenCon?

77
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,597
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty much.

78
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,320
MATT: Well, we'll put you in the front row.

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,900
(groaning)

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,967
TRAVIS: If you die, we will lower you from above
like an angel on a fly reel.

81
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,333
MATT: On the Peter Pan wire setup?

82
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,965
TRAVIS: With some asshole swinging you from side
to side.

83
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,990
MATT: Just sending you across the audience.

84
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,401
TRAVIS: (yelling) I want to get down, I can't feel
my legs!

85
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,777
MATT: Make an acrobatics check!

86
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,632
LIAM: It's going to be so fucking great.

87
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:52,616
MATT: So yes. Look forward to that.

88
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:55,078
LAURA: I like how we all assumed it was going to
be Sam that was dead and flying above the

89
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,480
audience.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,506
MATT: All right. So also, the Critical Role
podcast. We have up to episode 30 now available.

91
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:08,272
Next batch went up, so those of you who are coming
on the podcast audio version of our crazy story,

92
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:17,560
those episodes 21 to 30 are available for you now.
Talks Machina, once again on Tuesdays. We'll have

93
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,265
a discussion about this episode next week and on
Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, with our wonderful host

94
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,147
Brian Foster on Twitch and Alpha.

95
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,750
LIAM: Is next week the one that they're off,
though?

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,834
MATT: Are they off next week?

97
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,943
LIAM: I think they're taking a week off, no? The
week after?

98
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:42,575
MARISHA: Both? Both. The week after Gencon we will
be streaming the panel that we did at GenCon. I

99
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:49,971
feel like Brian is going to be in New York for
Ashley's birthday right now. He flew out today.

100
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:53,579
MATT: So not next Tuesday, but the Tuesday after.

101
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,510
LAURA: Wait, no! I thought he'll be back by then.
No?

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,480
LIAM: He'll chime in on Twitter.

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,510
MATT: Follow Talks Machina on Twitter for updates
about what's happening next episode.

104
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,062
TRAVIS: We planned this out <i>way</i> in advance.

105
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:14,061
MATT: Last couple things: Sagas of Sundry. The
final episode of Dread is now up on Alpha, and

106
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:16,404
we'll see the finale of that crazy, crazy ride.

107
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:21,096
TRAVIS: It's so good. It's scurry.

108
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:26,481
MARISHA: We've got our first Sagas of Sundry
tattoo! It's beautiful and gorgeous. I love it.

109
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,560
It's amazing.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,180
TRAVIS: I watch the show with the lights on
'cause it creeps me out.

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,821
MATT: Good. We didn't have that option. And also
the new episode of CelebriDND is up as well, where

112
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,453
I got to dungeon master wonderful John Bradley who
you may know as Sam Tarley on Game of Thrones.

113
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:48,778
Also, had a wonderful guest Laura and Liam joined
us for that. It was a lot of fun, so check it out.

114
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:55,494
I believe our last announcement today is the
birthday of one fabulous goliath barbarian.

115
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,671
TRAVIS: Once a year, y'all. Once a year.

116
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,195
MATT: Travis Willingham, happy birthday, buddy.

117
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,938
LAURA: Happy birthday, bb!

118
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:03,733
TRAVIS: I can't die today, right?

119
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,737
SAM: Where's the cake?

120
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,768
TRAVIS: It's in my stomach.

121
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:09,494
LAURA: There's no cake, y'all.

122
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:11,281
SAM: But where's the cake?

123
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:16,026
TRAVIS: I mean, that was awesome.

124
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:21,837
MARISHA: I have a little cake eraser. Do you want
the cake eraser for the game? Hang on. Where is

125
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:26,962
it? Where did I put it? Happy birthday!

126
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:30,251
TRAVIS: It's a little Pike cake!

127
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:37,516
MATT: And on that, enjoy your cake. And let's
bring us into tonight's episode of Critical

128
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,335
Role.

129
00:08:38,335 --> 00:10:08,420
[dramatic music]

130
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,274
MATT: And welcome back.

131
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:11,504
TRAVIS: We didn't say anything.

132
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:16,108
MATT: No, you didn't. I was waiting and there was
absolute silence. Wow. This is what it's like to have

133
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,018
respect.

134
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:20,447
(laughter)

135
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,407
MARISHA: 107 episodes later.

136
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:26,676
MATT: That's all it took. And it's the last time it'll
ever happen.

137
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,660
LIAM: Lulling you into a false sense of security.

138
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,902
MATT: So, anyway, last we left off, Vox Machina,
in facing the terrible threat of Vecna returned to

139
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:43,631
physical form, sent you all through this conflict
to seek audiences with a number of the deities of

140
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:53,786
Exandria. After getting blessings and fragments of
the essence of three of the gods, you discovered

141
00:10:53,786 --> 00:11:00,233
that Vecna had completed the Ritual of Seeding and
ascended into godhood. However, discussing with

142
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:07,659
Ioun, the Knowing Mistress, it will take a little
bit of time for him to both understand the extent

143
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:14,064
of his power, to claim his domains, and expand
beyond his current condensed avatar form, so time

144
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:18,683
is of the essence. Not to mention that in order to
claim the full strength, there needs to be a

145
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:26,112
showing of power and faith to gather attention and
faith from the masses.

146
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:33,429
So with that information, you also imbued upon
Grog the ability to blacksmith and Percival the

147
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,901
knowledge of the construct of these Divine
Trammels, things that could possibly be used to

148
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:43,764
seal and have been used previously to seal a god
as killing them is a very difficult and dangerous

149
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:52,474
thing. Retrieving this information, you discovered
that the place where these can be crafted is called

150
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:59,844
the Core Anvil. Once belonging to the All-Father,
the deity of construction, design and

151
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:08,458
craftsmanship, it resides beneath an underwater
volcano known as Scaldseat, off the shore of a city

152
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:16,817
called Shorecomb in Issylra. You also had a
fantastic little run-in with Vecna, recently,

153
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,600
taunting you all.

154
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,489
Last we left off, you had found yourself in
Vasselheim, went to the Trial Forge to speak with

155
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:34,089
Earthbreaker Groon, discovered what would be
required to attempt to make contact with Kord, and

156
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:42,419
you made communion with the Raven Queen, and in
declaring your complete faith in her she offered a

157
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:48,745
piece of her essence to give you the third seed
with which to make a third Divine Trammel, and

158
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,880
with you all falling asleep within Scanlan's
Magnificent Mansion, you cast True Polymorph on

159
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,968
yourself to take the form of a planetar and did
whatever you did in that form as you all went to

160
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:01,450
sleep that evening.

161
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:10,187
LIAM: Except that while he was checking out his
junk in the mirror-- heavenly junk-- I shut the

162
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:24,238
door behind Keyleth and I. I don't think we should
go another couple of days in silence.

163
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,657
MARISHA: Has it been days?

164
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:29,533
LIAM: Just barely.

165
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:34,869
MARISHA: Feels like an eternity.

166
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:51,667
LIAM: I know that you are angry, and I am just--
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:51,667 --> 00:14:03,305
MARISHA: I was angry. I was very angry, and maybe
if we had this conversation yesterday, even, I

168
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:24,523
might be yelling that to your face right now. But
it's hard to be angry at bravery and selflessness.

169
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:36,969
I mean, we've always had the problem of you having
one too many ladies in your life, right? (laughs)

170
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:42,198
It's hard to compete with a god.

171
00:14:42,198 --> 00:15:07,144
LIAM: I've done a lot of stupid things in my life,
and I've never had any regrets, really. I do know the

172
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:17,490
chance you took on me, and I've confirmed your
worst fears, and then some.

173
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,949
MARISHA: It's not your fault.

174
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:35,254
LIAM: Regardless, I am sorry, and I regret that
I'm not outright dead already and that you have to

175
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:54,351
stare at this walking pantomime of a life in front
of you, but Kiki, I'm grateful for the time I have

176
00:15:54,351 --> 00:16:07,829
left to look on you, and I am grateful to fight
for your future. And I'm grateful for that chance

177
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,648
you took on me.

178
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:22,235
MARISHA: I wouldn't take it back. You taught me
how to take chances. (laughs) Can I ask you a

179
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:36,104
question? What exactly was the deal that you made
with the Raven Queen? Was it when we slew Vecna,

180
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:46,848
or defeated him? I have a feeling semantics are
becoming increasingly more important.

181
00:16:46,848 --> 00:17:05,963
LIAM: She offered me a way back, and it was the
only way back. I wasn't coming back, not after

182
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,480
that. Not without her blessing.

183
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:35,272
MARISHA: Even if we found a way, you wouldn't take
it. To reverse the deal. I'm not asking. I'm just

184
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,155
confirming.

185
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:56,408
LIAM: I don't want to leave, but there are some
things that I will not test. Hey. I do have faith in

186
00:17:56,555 --> 00:18:13,525
her. And I have faith in you and what you'll do. (sighs)
God, I feel so stupid.

187
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:36,400
MARISHA: It's fitting, really. You can protect
that plane. I'll be here to protect this one. I

188
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:49,679
mean, if these past few days have taught us
anything, it's death isn't the end. I just don't

189
00:18:49,679 --> 00:19:06,784
want to forget. If Sprigg could forget the names
of his party members that he died alongside-- he

190
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:19,735
ran-- never mind. What's going to happen in a
hundred or hundreds or even a thousand years? I

191
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:31,213
don't want to forget this. What if there comes a
day when I don't even recognize the name Vox

192
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,267
Machina anymore?

193
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:52,917
LIAM: I don't believe that will happen. You're
going to live a long life. Yes. And you will love

194
00:19:52,917 --> 00:20:02,985
again. And you will lead. And you will be loved,
because who cannot love you?

195
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,724
MARISHA: I can name a few.

196
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:16,097
LIAM: No one of any worth.

197
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:29,779
MARISHA: I'm grateful for you, and I always will
be. And I'm grateful for any second that we have

198
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:36,862
left. And I don't want to spend any more being
angry at you. And I'm sorry that I was.

199
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:52,412
LIAM: You don't want me to go?

200
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:58,355
MARISHA: (laughs) Of course not.

201
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:07,592
LIAM: Hey, I'm fucking cold. Will you give me a
hug?

202
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:24,478
MARISHA: Yeah. It's the weirdest thing, by the
way, you being cold. I mean, it's just something

203
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,194
to get used to.

204
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:29,922
LIAM: Yeah.

205
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,578
MARISHA: Yeah.

206
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:39,794
LIAM: I don't have any clever closer. I'm just
going to crawl into bed and go to sleep.

207
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:47,987
MATT: Okay. Both of you curl up and fall asleep.
The morning comes. You all come to consciousness

208
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:59,819
within Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion. And find
breakfast of various grains and oats and quinoa.

209
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,055
TALIESIN: Lentils.

210
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:11,212
TRAVIS: What do you mean lentils? What is that?
What is a lentil? Is it a leaf? Is it a bean?

211
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,422
TALIESIN: No one really knows, to be fair.

212
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:16,898
TRAVIS: Why on god's green earth is it even here?
I don't understand.

213
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:18,703
TALIESIN: Lentils are here to punish us.

214
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:19,957
TRAVIS: Really?

215
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:23,840
TALIESIN: Yes. We have done something terribly
wrong, and now we must eat of these.

216
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,861
TRAVIS: That makes sense an hour from now when I
get punished in the loo.

217
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:29,075
TALIESIN: We are punished by that.

218
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:37,173
MARISHA: I'm sorry. This head cold mixed with
crying is bad.

219
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,683
LAURA: It gets you, right?

220
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,222
MATT: Yeah, it's rough.

221
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:42,244
LAURA: Yeah, that's what happened to me that day.

222
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,627
MARISHA: It's the worst!

223
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:48,770
SAM: Well, your voice is super sexy tonight, so
that's good.

224
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,488
LAURA: (raspy singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat--

225
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:54,585
MARISHA: (raspy singing) What are they feeding you?

226
00:22:54,585 --> 00:23:01,244
MATT: All right, so as you finish your meals in
the morning, prepare yourself for the actions of

227
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,260
the coming day, what do you wish to do?

228
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,817
LAURA: I don't fucking know.

229
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,201
SAM: Are we going to this volcano under the
water?

230
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,055
LAURA: Yeah, right? That's where we have to go.

231
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,575
SAM: We need to be able to swim.

232
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,217
TALIESIN: And we need to be immune to poison.

233
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:20,279
LAURA: Yes, so if we have a Heroes' Feast, that
will take care of one thing. And I have two

234
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,690
chalices because we never used the one.

235
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,949
SAM: We should save at least one for a certain
fight.

236
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,557
LAURA: Yes, obviously.

237
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,624
TRAVIS: You can make us breathe underwater,
right?

238
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:31,798
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

239
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:34,130
LAURA: All of us? Even Trinket?

240
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,857
MARISHA: (unsure) Yes?

241
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:36,886
LAURA: And Pike?

242
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:46,954
MATT: Well Pike, goes up-- yes, don't forget! "I
can prepare the feast for you guys. That way, you

243
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:56,891
"don't have to spend a spell of yours for it. As you guys
are on this mission to go make this-- I can be

244
00:23:56,891 --> 00:24:02,197
"help-- I think I need to stay here for now to
shepherd both the people in my temple of the

245
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:07,378
"Everlight with whatever words I can keep them calm
under this chaos in the city."

246
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:10,064
LAURA: Oh no! Pike, but what if Vasselheim is
attacked?

247
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:14,009
MATT: "Then I can let you know. I also have a
Sending spell prepared, so if anything happens, I

248
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:16,763
"can let you know immediately. As long as you're on
this plane."

249
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:20,439
SAM: It's so convenient!

250
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:27,107
MATT: "That's what clerics are here for!" She
punches you in the shoulder.

251
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:33,494
TRAVIS: Can I have something of yours, at least
until we see each other again?

252
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:37,228
(sounds of distress)

253
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:44,399
MATT: "Of course, Grog!" And she comes up to you
and, "Let me see your axe real fast."

254
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,063
TRAVIS: Ooh, the Bloodaxe?

255
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:47,129
MATT: "Yeah!"

256
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,060
TRAVIS: There you go! Mary Poppins handbag.

257
00:24:50,060 --> 00:25:02,228
MATT: She hefts it and takes a little bit of her
fading blue hair at the tip and carves off a

258
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:09,083
little piece of it, hands the axe back to you, and
very deftly braids it into a small braid, ties it

259
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,496
off, and hands it to you.

260
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:13,993
TRAVIS: (gasps) It's the sweetest thing ever.

261
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:15,959
MATT: "No, but seriously don't eat it, please."

262
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:20,756
LAURA: That's really creepy.

263
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:25,999
MATT: "Grog! No! No."

264
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:29,270
TRAVIS: I tie it onto my necklace.

265
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:36,259
MATT: Okay. "Please be safe. And if anything
happens, I'm going to let you know as soon as

266
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,307
"possible."

267
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:40,962
LIAM: Oh man, it's going to hurt not to have you
with us, though. Oh, well.

268
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:44,672
MATT: "You guys will be fine. Better we save our
strength for whatever's out there."

269
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:48,989
TRAVIS: Yeah, and if Vasselheim is attacked, you
don't go saving the city all by yourself.

270
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:50,192
LAURA: Seriously.

271
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:52,389
TRAVIS: I know what you're like.

272
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,539
MATT: "Why would I steal the fun from you?"

273
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,369
TRAVIS: That's what I thought.

274
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,269
MATT: "Okay!"

275
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,737
TRAVIS: All right. Bye, Pike.

276
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:04,385
LAURA: Wait no, she has to prepare the Heroes'
Feast for us before we say goodbye.

277
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,573
TRAVIS: Hi, Pike!

278
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:14,012
MATT: You hand her the chalice, and she prepares
the feast within the mansion, so what little bit

279
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:20,711
of for some of you may have been an unsatisfying
breakfast this morning is quickly taken over by

280
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:27,973
the fantastically tasting feast of such a holy
spread. Taking the hour to eat it, all of you guys

281
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,436
get the benefits of Heroes' Feast.

282
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:30,673
TRAVIS: No lentils, right?

283
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,914
MATT: There is a bowl of lentils for those who may
want it.

284
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,055
SAM: I had some.

285
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:39,473
(laughter)

286
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:44,384
MATT: All right, so as the Heroes' Feast says
here--

287
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:48,990
LAURA: Immune to fear and poison and advantage on
wisdom checks.

288
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,807
MARISHA: And you roll 2d10 extra.

289
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:54,728
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving throws.

290
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:57,912
MATT: I'm going to roll 2d10 for you guys.

291
00:26:57,912 --> 00:27:00,913
LAURA: Do you guys want food now, or do you want
to wait until the break?

292
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,868
TRAVIS and MATT: Let's wait until the break.

293
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,255
TALIESIN: We'll take a slightly early break in the
long run.

294
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,974
MATT: Whoa! Two nines!

295
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:08,532
(cheering)

296
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:14,314
MATT: That's lucky. Okay, so there you go. That's
18 additional hit points.

297
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:15,593
LAURA: That can regenerate?

298
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:20,872
MATT: Yes. That's the maximum of your hit points
for the next 24 hours, so keep that in mind,

299
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:21,831
folks.

300
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,346
MARISHA: Yeah, dope!

301
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:27,102
LAURA: How long do your inspiring speeches last?

302
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:33,340
MARISHA: Oh, that is an excellent question. How
long do my speeches--

303
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,594
SAM: Said Kathleen Turner.

304
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:38,559
LIAM: Said Harvey Fierstein.

305
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,074
(laughter)

306
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:42,114
MARISHA: Said Katharine Hepburn.

307
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:50,222
MATT: Inspiring Leader. A creature can't gain
temporary hit points from this feat again until it

308
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:53,857
has finished a short or long rest. So you have
temporary hit points until your next long rest,

309
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:55,480
essentially.

310
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,334
MARISHA: Okay. So can I double up on that?

311
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:58,848
LIAM: Give us more hit points?

312
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,545
MATT: You can. It'll be temporary hit points on
top of that, yes.

313
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:03,119
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah.

314
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,805
SAM: We're probably not going to fight anything,
though.

315
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:13,380
MARISHA: Since my voice is completely shot, and I
don't want to do a speech.

316
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,879
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we need it.

317
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,691
MARISHA: I am going to do--

318
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,348
MARISHA and SAM: An interpretive dance!

319
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,309
(laughter)

320
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:30,601
MARISHA: Of us swimming through the volcano, and
then going underground and shielding ourselves,

321
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:40,438
and then fighting! And then Grog's forging the
trammels!

322
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:52,508
(enthusiastic a cappella music)

323
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:54,989
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

324
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:57,946
LIAM: Still shouted narration through it all.

325
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,970
(laughter)

326
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,644
MATT: Wow, that happened.

327
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:07,207
TALIESIN: I'm amazed that took over a hundred
episodes. I've been waiting for the interpretive

328
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,641
dance for a long time.

329
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,034
LAURA: Yay, how many did we get from that?

330
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:13,474
MATT: So everyone gets 18 temporary hit points,
right?

331
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:15,692
TALIESIN: Is that max goes up 18?

332
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:21,147
MATT: No, temporary hit points, so as soon as you
take damage, they go away from the temporary

333
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:24,869
first. Temporary never come back. Then you have
the maximum hit point bonus.

334
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:30,053
TALIESIN: So 18 max up and then an 18 on top of
that that goes away once you get hit.

335
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,354
LIAM: But do I get sneak attack damage, or is it
also a critical hit?

336
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:42,057
MATT: Raven Queen taketh away. All right, so as
you guys are all sitting there watching Keyleth

337
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:48,079
dance while she eats, while you're eating, it's a
unique display. You're prepared for the rest of

338
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,509
your day, Pike says goodbye to everybody, gives
you a hug. Says, "Be safe."

339
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:57,771
SAM: Pike, will you do me a favor, and will you
get word to Kaylie somehow?

340
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,231
MATT: "I can do that, yeah."

341
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:04,304
SAM: Tell her Dad's okay and saving the world
again.

342
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:09,757
MATT: She goes, "...Done!"

343
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,265
MARISHA: Hey, Pike?

344
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:14,245
SAM: I should have asked that long ago!

345
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,081
MATT: "Probably, yeah!"

346
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,963
MARISHA: Could you also do one of those to Tary?

347
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:22,659
MATT: "Right!"

348
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:27,819
SAM: Well, don't say, "Dad's okay, saving the world
again." That won't make any sense to him.

349
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,253
MARISHA: Tell him we're all alive.

350
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:34,848
LAURA: Tell him we love him, and that we're okay
for the time being.

351
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:37,505
SAM: Especially Scanlan. He's probably really
concerned.

352
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:42,620
MATT: (laughs) You see this secondary dull flash
and release of energy at her fingertips as she

353
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,795
finishes the glyph.

354
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:45,221
TALIESIN: Are we doing this now?

355
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,571
MATT: There we go, we have food now!

356
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:49,280
LAURA: We're doing it live! Can I have one slice
of breakfast pizza?

357
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,065
SAM: What is this, a restaurant?

358
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,065
TRAVIS: Jesus, what the fuck?

359
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:56,914
LAURA: He's like: hold on.

360
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:59,645
LIAM: Pelor, can I have one slice of breakfast
pizza, please?

361
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:02,323
(laughter)

362
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:05,143
MARISHA: This marker sucks balls!

363
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:10,749
MATT: So Pike makes her way toward her temple. You
guys are still within Scanlan's mansion, what are

364
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:11,728
you doing?

365
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:15,050
LAURA: Okay, I guess we should exit the mansion.
And then--

366
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,843
SAM: How are we traveling? And where are we
going?

367
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:21,141
TRAVIS: Do we Plane Shift?

368
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:24,692
LAURA: Above the water, over to the volcano. How
do we do this?

369
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:33,362
MARISHA: It's a bit away from Vasselheim, if I
remember. I did see a tree, right, that was near

370
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:34,391
the town?

371
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:35,532
MATT: Yep.

372
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,094
MARISHA: So yeah.

373
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:40,890
LAURA: Okay, so once we're there, do we know
exactly what we're doing?

374
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:47,823
SAM: We're diving down into the volcano, forging
some trammels.

375
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,098
LAURA: And the volcano's underwater. Is that what
the schtick is with it?

376
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:56,841
MATT: Yes. It's on the floor, and you can notice
it because across this open clear ocean, there is

377
00:31:56,841 --> 00:32:00,204
one column of black smoke that emits from the
waves.

378
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:02,300
LAURA: So it's an active volcano that we're
diving into?

379
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:03,318
TALIESIN: Underwater.

380
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:04,298
LAURA: Solid.

381
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,428
MATT: Essentially.

382
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:14,983
SAM: One question. I have the infinite blessings
of Ioun's knowledge. I am a holy man. However, I'm

383
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:22,116
not exactly clear. Do we need those little peas to
make these trammels? And we have three of them.

384
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:28,135
We're not going to get more of these before we
forge the trams?

385
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:30,178
LAURA: I don't think there's time.

386
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:40,266
TRAVIS: Remember, Delilah was already down there?
She was in tunnels underground, right?

387
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,321
LAURA: Somewhere. We don't know where, exactly.

388
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,111
TRAVIS: We don't know if she's at this forge?

389
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:47,009
LAURA: No, we don't know if she's there, we don't know
if she's with Vecna.

390
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:51,054
MATT: The vision that you had, she was topside,
and there was snow.

391
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:56,691
MARISHA: Yeah, she was coming out of Thar
Amphala.

392
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,754
MATT: Well, tunnels that burrowed beneath the city
of Thar Amphala.

393
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:05,298
MARISHA: And she was coming out. She had both of
her eyeballs back, and was like, "Ooh, it's

394
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:10,042
"chilly." Bitch! Enjoying the winter snow.

395
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,633
LIAM: Two regular eyes?

396
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:20,272
MARISHA: Two regular eyes! Why do you think she
keeps coming back? (gasps) Oh no.

397
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:28,210
TRAVIS, LAURA, and LIAM: What?

398
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,474
TALIESIN: You're nervous about everything, is that
what we've come to?

399
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:35,823
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe she made a deal
similar to the deals we've made, but with Vecna.

400
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,670
TALIESIN: I would assume so.

401
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:43,874
MARISHA: I mean, if gods can give us their
blessing, why can't she have one?

402
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:46,961
SAM: We should really tip 10%.

403
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,530
LAURA: I know, at least!

404
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,835
SAM: You know, be really generous.

405
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:53,445
LAURA: Look at this! You guys!

406
00:33:53,445 --> 00:34:01,238
TRAVIS: So we go. Right? Do we go to the shore and
then out into the ocean on a ship?

407
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:06,944
LAURA: We go to the shore, then we climb up the
volcano, then we dive into the volcano?

408
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,879
TRAVIS: The volcano is underneath the ocean.

409
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,690
LAURA: But there's smoke coming out of it!

410
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,229
TRAVIS: Underneath the ocean.

411
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:16,721
MARISHA: Yeah. A trail of black, sooty, bubbly
goodness.

412
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,071
TRAVIS: We've only talked about it for four hours;
it's okay.

413
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:21,759
LAURA: I thought maybe the top was coming out of
the water.

414
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:28,300
MATT: No, it's at the bottom of the ocean.
There are volcanoes underwater, and this one is

415
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:36,604
less burning smoke. It's the sulfuric gases and
poisonous fumes of the various reactions and

416
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,289
chemicals and pressure beneath.

417
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,330
TRAVIS: You never watched behind the scenes on
Titanic?

418
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,844
LAURA: I got it.

419
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,899
SAM: How do we get there?

420
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,294
TRAVIS: We go to the shore.

421
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,795
MARISHA: Well, I have a tree. I can get us there.

422
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:55,585
SAM: Okay. Let's do it.

423
00:34:55,585 --> 00:35:03,482
MATT: So. With your things gathered, you all find
your way, I imagine it's not too far of a walk

424
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:09,509
from the Raven's Crest to a tree that is
functional for this spell. It's on the southern

425
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:15,941
border of the quarter that holds the Birthheart,
the orchards and various trees

426
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:22,236
there. You find yourselves a suitable tree, gather
yourselves, steel yourselves. Now that the morning

427
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:27,568
has come, the tension in the air of Vasselheim and
the word that spreads of some sort of looming

428
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:38,597
threat, though sourceless and directionless,
definitely has built this air of fear and rush for

429
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,298
preparation that surrounds you.

430
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:44,184
TRAVIS: I have a question, sorry.

431
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,124
MATT: Yes?

432
00:35:45,124 --> 00:35:47,738
TRAVIS: Did Pike come with us to send us off?

433
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:50,353
MATT: I'll say sure! She walks you guys to the
tree.

434
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:56,905
TRAVIS: Pike? You know you have-- what's it called
you put on me one time? That Death Ward? Should we

435
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:01,897
put that on one of us before we go, just in case
it's super dangerous? One of the squishier ones?

436
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:07,084
Does someone want Death Ward, so if you go down--

437
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,738
SAM: Put it on Vax.

438
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:09,966
TRAVIS: Yeah, no.

439
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,599
LAURA: I think either Percy or I.

440
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,713
LIAM: Pass.

441
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,940
LAURA: You.

442
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,943
TALIESIN: You.

443
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,316
SAM: Oh god, just kiss already!

444
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:19,946
TALIESIN: We do.

445
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:22,889
SAM: Oh god! They do.

446
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,463
TRAVIS: Boulder-Parchment-Shears. Perfect
opportunity.

447
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,051
TALIESIN: Flip for it. Heads or tails?

448
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,306
MARISHA: Boulder-Parchment-Shears.

449
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:28,173
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

450
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,382
TALIESIN: Boulder-Parchment-Shears?

451
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:31,545
TRAVIS: One time. One, two, three, go!

452
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:32,710
MARISHA: Oh!

453
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,529
LAURA: You.

454
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:34,759
SAM: Boulder always wins.

455
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,800
MATT: "I can give it to a few people."

456
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,888
(laughter)

457
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:41,156
LAURA: Thanks, Pike! That's convenient.

458
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:48,474
MATT: "That's going to tap out my spells there.
I'm going to have to save some for Sending, just

459
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,402
"in case."

460
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:50,797
LAURA: Yes, of course.

461
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:51,804
TRAVIS: Those two.

462
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:53,149
SAM: Mr. and Mrs. de Rolo.

463
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:56,013
MATT: "Okay, this'll only last for eight hours, so
travel quickly."

464
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,590
TALIESIN: It's Mr. and Mrs. Vex, let's be fair.

465
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,121
TRAVIS: Thanks, Pike. I thought it might help.
Just in case.

466
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,913
MATT: "You, too?"

467
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:06,462
TRAVIS: Nope! Nope. I like a little danger in my
life.

468
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:11,625
LAURA: Is this going to be like the kraken fight?
Are we going to be underwater fighting again?

469
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,202
MARISHA: I hope not.

470
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:17,561
LAURA: You weren't there. We almost fucking died
because you weren't there with us, Scanlan. I

471
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,193
hated you at that moment.

472
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:24,040
LIAM: Water under the bridge. Water under the
kraken. We're on brighter horizons

473
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,837
MATT: As you guys are arguing, she leans forward
and beneath her breath finishes the incantation

474
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:37,232
with the Death Ward, and you, Vex'ahlia, it sounds
like a soft clinging of gentle metals in the back

475
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:41,650
of your head, and as it hits this warmth hits your
chest and then it sets in. It doesn't quite fade,

476
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:48,117
it's like having a localized blanket held to your
sternum. Who else would like one?

477
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:50,444
MARISHA: How many does she get?

478
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:53,142
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of this, she can
muster four.

479
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:54,493
LAURA: Scanlan.

480
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,209
LIAM: (raspy voice) How many does she get?

481
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,995
MARISHA: (mafia-style voice) How many you got?

482
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:59,728
TRAVIS: Do you want one?

483
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:01,104
MARISHA: Yeah.

484
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:06,926
LAURA: If you die, I'm going to be really upset.

485
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:11,171
TRAVIS: On my birthday? Come on! What are the
chances?

486
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:15,068
MARISHA: He's got that whole barbarian "knock me
down, I get back up again" thing.

487
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:21,368
LAURA: I get the fuck back up again! You're
Hercules Mulligan!

488
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:24,331
MARISHA: That's why he would be a rogue/barbarian,
I think!

489
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:29,330
MATT: So for those four that have marked it, you
have Death Ward, which lasts for eight hours. The

490
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,870
first time you drop to zero hit points, it brings
you to one, and then the spell fades.

491
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:44,710
All right. Pike sends you off with a wave and you
all step through the tree. You feel the

492
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,929
transitional burst of energy as the druidic magics
pull you from one living source to another, and

493
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:55,640
you all emerge on the outside of a tree that is
barely wide enough to sustain the doorway between

494
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,929
the two, and as you all gather on the outskirts,
you turn around and you can see this

495
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:07,505
somewhat-leafless, living through the winter, but
not the prettiest tree you've seen. The doorway

496
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:09,856
portal closes behind you.

497
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:17,053
Glancing around you, there is a light snowfall and
you can see slush and snow gathered, dirty, along

498
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:24,593
the edges of the streets. You are on the outskirts
of the city of Shorecomb. Population-wise, it

499
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:33,650
can't be more than a few thousand people at most.
It looks like there's a very healthy fish trade.

500
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,220
To the immediate right of you, there's a
cliffside, maybe 200 feet from the edge of the

501
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:46,879
town where there are carts going to and from. You
can the large crane carrying large containers and

502
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:55,097
large nets filled with caught fish from the bottom
of the cliffside. People around noticed you emerge

503
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:59,767
from a tree, and you can see about four or five of
the various peasants and working folk stop in

504
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,991
their tracks and stare at you, frozen.

505
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:06,075
LIAM: I know, weird, right? Really weird.

506
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,787
MARISHA: Hi!

507
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:14,999
MATT: "This way, James." And he grabs his little
kid's hand and the kid is slack-jawed watching you

508
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:19,947
as he drags him off to the side. People start
walking again and still glancing over their

509
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,680
shoulder, they go about their business, keeping a
very close eye.

510
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,165
MARISHA: Maybe I should have found a tree less in
the center of things.

511
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:27,944
TALIESIN: I'd rather be here.

512
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:31,483
MATT: It's not the center of town, thankfully.
Still off to the side, but you did catch the eye

513
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,933
of a few folk.

514
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:37,037
LIAM: I mean, you still transported us a long way.
That's commendable.

515
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:42,502
TALIESIN: How would one go about finding out if
you're being watched via magical means? Is there a

516
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:46,936
way to do that other than if one is not a magic
user? Is that a perception check?

517
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:50,533
MATT: No, there are actual spells designed for
that.

518
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:55,410
LAURA: Are there spells designed to mask you?

519
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,647
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't think any of us have them.

520
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:02,687
SAM: To mask you from scrying?

521
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:07,840
LAURA: Yeah, so people can't see us. Do you know
of anything like that, Scanlan?

522
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,259
SAM: I've heard of such things, but I don't
currently have one.

523
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,595
TRAVIS: Cool.

524
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,456
TALIESIN: Just curious.

525
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,188
TRAVIS: Good question.

526
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:20,654
LAURA: Yeah, because Vecna's fucking watching us.

527
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:21,682
TRAVIS: Right now?!

528
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,111
LAURA: Yeah, all the fucking time.

529
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,706
TRAVIS: You're sure?

530
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:26,631
LAURA: Yeah.

531
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,674
TALIESIN: Yeah, right over there.

532
00:41:28,674 --> 00:41:33,650
TRAVIS: Do we take a boat now? Or do we find some
dolphins and ride out majestically?

533
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,079
LAURA: Are we on the water?

534
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,357
MARISHA: Can we make our way to the shoreline?

535
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:44,838
MATT: Okay, it's a couple hundred feet to get to
the edge of the cliff. And these are sheer cliffs

536
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:53,879
that drop off for 150, 200 feet or so before it
hits very hard pebbled beaches. These aren't sandy

537
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,981
beaches.

538
00:41:54,981 --> 00:42:00,572
MARISHA: I stop everybody, saying, be careful. It
looks like it could be a thousand feet, which is

539
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:01,776
deceiving.

540
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:07,008
TRAVIS: You know, you're only talking to yourself.
We all know.

541
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:13,325
MARISHA: A thousand feet is so long.

542
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:17,179
LIAM: So we're on cliffs facing the ocean, right
now?

543
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:19,860
MATT: Yes, you guys are at the edge of the cliff.
You look down, and there are the rocky beaches,

544
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:29,312
there are a number of large docks that jut out from
the rocky beach, and you can see there are

545
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:36,367
about five or six varying degrees of rickety
winding wooden staircases that are built into the

546
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,558
cliffside that lead from the top edge of the cliff
down to the beach below. You can see a lot of

547
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:46,174
workers are currently hauling large sacks, small
crates and boxes, things that are too small to

548
00:42:46,174 --> 00:42:52,256
bring on the large winding cranes that they have
on the edge as well. There are ships coming, there

549
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:59,029
are ships going. It looks like this is a decent
trade stop for cities along the shoreside here in

550
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:00,071
Issylra.

551
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:03,071
LAURA: What do our elven eyes see? Can we see the
smoke?

552
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:05,093
MATT: Make a perception check.

553
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,444
LAURA: That was a Legolas reference, in case you
were wondering.

554
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:09,505
LIAM: I'm not familiar with that reference.

555
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:11,852
LAURA: A perception check?

556
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:12,961
MATT: Yes.

557
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,220
LAURA: 20.

558
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:22,051
MATT: 20. Glancing out at this distance, the sky
itself is very cloudy, very gray. It's a very gray

559
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:27,205
day. It's cold, it's chilly, the wind that's blowing
is very faint, but it's enough to the point

560
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:32,553
where snow is falling. There is a very faint mist
in the distance. Either a storm is coming or a

561
00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:37,348
storm has passed that's preventing you from seeing
any sign of a glimmer of the smoke. So you're not

562
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,139
entirely certain the direction.

563
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,292
MARISHA: Can I tell if the storm is coming or the
storm has passed?

564
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,320
MATT: Make a nature check.

565
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,922
LIAM: And there are people about?

566
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:47,028
MATT: There are people about and some of them are
just passing, not paying mind, and few of them

567
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:51,481
stop and glance at these very well-dressed, very
dangerous-looking figures that have now just

568
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:56,019
walked up and look out past the ocean, but no
one's broaching any conversation. They look like they're

569
00:43:56,019 --> 00:44:00,105
more making a wide berth or keeping a very
untrusting eye on you as they walk past.

570
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,977
LIAM: Druid's doing interpretive dance again.

571
00:44:01,977 --> 00:44:03,090
MATT: So what did you get?

572
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,976
MARISHA: I'm a motherfucking human barometer!

573
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,043
MATT: What did you roll?

574
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,077
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Natural 20.

575
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,360
MATT: Oh shit! Okay.

576
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,477
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm really good at the check.

577
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:15,470
MATT: You get the sense that a lot of the snow
that was in the street when you got there and the

578
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,776
slush was from a storm that recently passed. And
the clouds and the fog that you see in the

579
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:21,822
distance, it looks like it's blowing away.

580
00:44:21,822 --> 00:44:23,784
LIAM: You there, little girl.

581
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:30,263
MATT: Okay. (laughing) Strangely, no little girl
is working at this dock. However, the person you

582
00:44:30,263 --> 00:44:36,045
did see that looked like a little girl is actually
a generally short fellow who has a wrap over the

583
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:40,136
top of his head, a swollen cheek where it looks
like he might have some sort of a tooth infection

584
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:45,101
who spins around. It's not a bonnet. It's a crusty
looking fisherman, who is like, "Who are you

585
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:46,262
"calling a little girl?"

586
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:53,595
LIAM: Oh, my bad, fellow! Sorry, as you can tell,
we're not from around here. Visiting. Yeah, I had

587
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:57,268
a couple of questions. One, there's a
volcano just off this coast somewhere, right?

588
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:58,871
MATT: "Aye."

589
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:01,267
LIAM: Do you know where it is? Could you point to
it?

590
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:03,212
TALIESIN: Was that affirmative or surprise?

591
00:45:03,212 --> 00:45:04,858
MATT: Points out to the ocean.

592
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:08,606
LAURA: Is he pointing in a general direction? I
look where he's pointing. Can I see anything?

593
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,621
MATT: No.

594
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:10,889
LAURA: Damn it.

595
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:13,766
LIAM: Are there boats for rent, for hire?

596
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:20,656
MATT: "Maybe? Yes? I mean--"

597
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:25,531
LIAM: All right, thank you, I think that's all I
needed from you, okay.

598
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:30,240
LAURA: I pull out a piece of gold. Do you know
where the volcano is?

599
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,282
MATT: "Yes. What, do you think I'm a dog? What is
this kind of treatment?"

600
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:38,732
LAURA: Do you want to make some gold?

601
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:40,085
MATT: "Yes! I'd love to make some gold!"

602
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:42,105
LAURA: Then can you tell me where the fucking
volcano is?

603
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:48,805
MATT: "There we go, straight questions." He rubs
his swollen cheek side. You can see his teeth are

604
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:55,241
graying and yellow. There's a little bit of blackened
decay at the edges, but he grins a little bit

605
00:45:55,241 --> 00:46:00,570
at the sight of the gold. "I need a little more
than that paltry sum."

606
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:06,343
LAURA: Paltry sum? How much gold do you see every
day? I pull out another piece. Is this enough?

607
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:11,671
MATT: "Make it five, and I'll introduce you to my
docksmen."

608
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:15,051
LAURA: All I want to know is where the volcano
is.

609
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:20,049
MATT: "But you're not looking for a ship to rent,
right? Like he said?"

610
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:21,373
LAURA: No.

611
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:33,517
MATT: "All right. (sniffles) Volcano is that way."
And he points out. You see he glances over, he

612
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:37,955
lines up where you can see a couple of larger
rocks that are breaking out from the shore surface

613
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:42,668
maybe 20 or 30 feet out from where the pebble
beach ends and meets the water line. He's lining

614
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:47,994
up his arm and, "That way, about five miles."

615
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:49,773
MARISHA: Five miles.

616
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,834
TRAVIS: Hey, use your elven eyes, see if you can
see it.

617
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:55,667
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to look real hard. We're a
thousand feet up.

618
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:59,427
MATT: Still, it's too hard to see right now.

619
00:46:59,427 --> 00:47:02,425
LAURA: Can't we spell ourselves out there?

620
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:03,759
MARISHA: Well.

621
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:07,271
TALIESIN: We might want that later.

622
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:12,640
MARISHA: I mean, we could. We can.

623
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,587
LAURA: We should rent a ship.

624
00:47:14,587 --> 00:47:17,626
TALIESIN: If we get a ship, then when it's all
over, we have a way out.

625
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:21,264
TRAVIS: Otherwise, we're walking five miles
underwater.

626
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:26,837
MARISHA: I would rather save my 8th-level Animal
Shapes in case we need to bail.

627
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:29,593
LAURA: All right, here's three more gold. How
about that introduction?

628
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:36,507
MATT: "That I can muster." Puts the coins in a
little pouch in the side and buttons it up and

629
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:40,141
locks it. "All right. Follow me."

630
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,246
SAM: What's your name, young lady?

631
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:45,524
MATT: "Fenna."

632
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:49,625
SAM: Fenna. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

633
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,443
MATT: "You as well, lass."

634
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:54,908
MARISHA: I love Fenna in my salads.

635
00:47:54,908 --> 00:48:02,305
MATT: Leads you guys back down one of the winding
stairways, and you have to wait at certain

636
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:08,367
moments. There are certain areas where it
switchbacks, and it's open. You would think it's a

637
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:13,676
platform for looking out, but it's more for
letting people get past, and for the pathways up

638
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:17,484
and down, it gets narrow on the actual stairs. But
eventually, you make your way down to where these

639
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:22,254
docks are, and there are three large buildings
that are the hubs of most people checking in,

640
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:26,834
checking out. They have a number of docksmen that
are keeping tabs on what's going in and out of the

641
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:32,272
dock, and what materials are being shipped in,
taxing those that are using it temporarily,

642
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:39,316
general business in the vicinity. He leads you
over. "Now then, I'm going to introduce you to

643
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:49,697
"Senth. She can rent you something, at the very
least. I recommend not letting that one in. She

644
00:48:49,697 --> 00:48:51,902
"has a thing against the smaller folk."

645
00:48:51,902 --> 00:48:53,517
LIAM: Oh shit.

646
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:58,345
SAM: Oh. I'm being racisted against?

647
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:04,138
MATT: "Look, I'm not-- You seem like a very fine
lady."

648
00:49:04,138 --> 00:49:08,035
SAM: Touché, Fenna. Touché.

649
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:18,825
MATT: "But I know Senth well, and if you want to
make a good impression, maybe keep her outside."

650
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:22,416
LAURA: You're not the tallest yourself, you know.

651
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:32,844
MATT: Stretches his lower back with a couple of
cracks and snaps. The hunched man gets about four,

652
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,587
five inches of height and is almost cresting about
Vax height.

653
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:41,995
TRAVIS: Look, Scanlan. The necklace is really nice
on the inside. I can vouch for it.

654
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:45,139
SAM: I'm not going into the necklace.

655
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:49,304
TRAVIS: Why not? New experiences, right? Whatever
it takes to achieve the mission.

656
00:49:49,304 --> 00:49:56,351
LAURA: Fuck it! Fuck it, I'm not disguising him
because of what he looks like! Fuck that.

657
00:49:56,351 --> 00:49:58,035
SAM: Are you standing up for me?

658
00:49:58,035 --> 00:49:59,677
LAURA: Of course I am!

659
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:02,615
MARISHA: I would like to argue, he just disguised
himself for a solid year.

660
00:50:02,615 --> 00:50:09,425
LAURA: I don't care. That was a different reason,
and if your fucking dock mistress is such a bitch

661
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:12,373
that she won't give us a good deal because of him
then we'll find someone else.

662
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:15,853
MATT: Fair enough. I would also recommend you
lower your voice. We're right outside of her

663
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:17,031
door.

664
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:18,977
MARISHA: Wait, what's her name?

665
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:20,092
MATT: Senth.

666
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:21,021
MARISHA: Senth.

667
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,122
SAM: It's really easy. I don't mind putting on the
hat.

668
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:30,479
MARISHA: It is the principle, but do we have time
for principles?

669
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:33,665
TALIESIN: We have time for principles immediately
afterwards, when we come back.

670
00:50:33,665 --> 00:50:36,133
LIAM: We never have before. Why start now?

671
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:40,280
LAURA: I mean, it's up to you, but I don't think
you should do it.

672
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,053
SAM: No, let's stand on principle.

673
00:50:42,053 --> 00:50:43,393
TALIESIN: Oh no.

674
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:46,546
MATT: "Are we done here?"

675
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:48,467
TALIESIN: Oh, you're still here.

676
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,125
MATT: "Good day."

677
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,502
TRAVIS: Thanks for your time.

678
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:58,254
MATT: Hobbles off and makes his way back up the
stairs. So you come outside to this one dock hub.

679
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:06,555
It's a modest two-story building looks like it has
like a watch tower second story and the bottom

680
00:51:06,555 --> 00:51:14,080
floor is much larger. The door is currently
closed. The wood looks a little sea-rotted. You

681
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:21,766
can see the edges of the wood are curling and dark
and perpetually damp. Little bits of green moss

682
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:25,759
and various fungus are starting to gather at the
very edges of the building, but it seems to be

683
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:27,912
standing and has been there for a while.

684
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:31,405
TALIESIN: (knocking sound)

685
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:35,416
MATT: You knock on the door. A voice inside goes
"Come in."

686
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:40,728
TALIESIN: (door creak) I don't know why I made the
sound effect.

687
00:51:40,728 --> 00:51:50,275
MATT: That's okay. As you push the door open,
glancing inside, there's general gray dull

688
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:54,794
daylight coming from the cloudy sky, but
there are also a few oil lanterns hanging in

689
00:51:54,794 --> 00:52:00,944
different places. You can see stacks of maps or
other heavy pieces of parchment that are curled up

690
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:06,182
and tied off in sections. There are small crates,
most of them empty, that are scattered about the

691
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:14,412
entranceway here, and as you enter the building
you watch as a very tall, thin, lanky female

692
00:52:14,412 --> 00:52:21,351
half-orc spins around across the room with a
singular monocle that is very, very intense to

693
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:26,399
make one eye look really big over the other. Spins
around; sides of the head shaved and the rest of

694
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:33,107
it slicked back against the head with a little bit
of a light brown shock against the black to one

695
00:52:33,107 --> 00:52:38,849
side. Dressed fairly nice but you can see the
clothing at an immediate glance is nice upfront

696
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:43,344
and then tatters at the bottom. Spins around.
"Yes?"

697
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:49,769
TALIESIN: We were hoping to charter a ship at
great expedience to about five miles off the coast

698
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:52,628
to the plume of smoke and the underwater volcano.

699
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,978
MATT: You watch as the one eye, moving
independently of the other, glances and looks each

700
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:03,142
of you very quickly up and down and then slicks
back into place. "That can be arranged, yes."

701
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,523
TALIESIN: Excellent.

702
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:10,201
MATT: "How long would you wish to charter this
ship?"

703
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:12,732
TRAVIS: Three days?

704
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:17,037
LAURA: Sure, yeah, probably be less than that but
three days, sure.

705
00:53:17,037 --> 00:53:18,679
MATT: Do you have a crew?

706
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:21,136
TALIESIN: No, we would need to--

707
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:24,224
SAM: Can any of us sail?

708
00:53:24,224 --> 00:53:26,842
TRAVIS: Not if we want to live.

709
00:53:26,842 --> 00:53:30,046
TALIESIN: We would like to charter a crew also to
maintain. We're going to be doing a bit of

710
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:32,651
underwater search and rescue, so.

711
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:34,312
MATT: "Very well then."

712
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:38,214
SAM: Will that be possible?

713
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,868
MATT: "Yes."

714
00:53:41,868 --> 00:53:44,036
LAURA: Great. Wonderful.

715
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:53,887
MATT: "Three days' rental including a crew on
board. That'll run you approximately 150 gold

716
00:53:53,887 --> 00:54:02,759
"pieces. I require, to be in case you lose the ship
or don't return with it, an additional 500 to hold

717
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:09,440
"in case you lose the ship. So a grand total of 650
up front with 500 to be returned upon your

718
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,116
"return."

719
00:54:11,116 --> 00:54:17,054
LAURA: Of course, and you have something to sign.
I'm sure Percival can draw something up.

720
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:21,818
MATT: "Oh, but of course. I would not dream of
allowing such a thing without a paper trail."

721
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:25,190
TALIESIN: That will do.

722
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:35,962
MATT: "Follow me." A quick contract is drawn up.
You take a glance over it, Percival. Seems very

723
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:41,324
thorough but nothing beyond what was requested and
basically if the ship is not returned all money is

724
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:50,396
forfeit. When the ship is returned, a very intense
investigation and perceived state of the ship is

725
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:56,996
going to be requested from an appraiser to see if
any damage was taken. Yeah, it's essentially like

726
00:54:56,996 --> 00:55:01,427
one of those seedy car rental places that the
contract says they will ding you for every

727
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:02,677
damage.

728
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,723
LAURA: How much do ships normally cost?

729
00:55:04,723 --> 00:55:06,894
TALIESIN: I don't know.

730
00:55:06,894 --> 00:55:08,927
LAURA: 600 is very low.

731
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:10,269
SAM: I feel like we've rented a ship before.

732
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,927
LAURA: But it was far less than this.

733
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:14,931
TALIESIN: It was far less than this, but at this
point I'm saying let's blow the money.

734
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:20,066
LAURA: Yes, of course. I agree, but an entire ship
I feel like would be more than 600.

735
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,955
TRAVIS: We priced it out once before, and it was like
30,000.

736
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:27,734
LAURA: Yeah, so she's giving us a really good
deal.

737
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,784
SAM: Maybe it's a shitty ship.

738
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:35,439
MARISHA: I mean, that's fine. I'd prefer a shitty
ship if it's cheaper.

739
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:38,896
MATT: Slaps the contract down in front. "Have we a
deal?"

740
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:40,181
TALIESIN: I don't mind.

741
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:41,643
MATT: "Very well."

742
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:49,412
SAM: Would you take this as a deposit? I give her
this platinum bracelet with a sapphire that I

743
00:55:49,412 --> 00:56:00,097
have. We'll get it back when we return the ship.
Oh, wait.

744
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:02,086
LAURA: Maybe you should amend that in the
contract.

745
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:10,608
MATT: The one eye is still looking at you. The
other is (buzzing) in front of the bracelet. "I

746
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:13,321
"find this acceptable in our agreement."

747
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:20,836
SAM: But wait, it just occurred to me as I was handing
that over, we need platinum, don't we? That was

748
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,035
platinum, wasn't it?

749
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:23,219
LAURA: Yeah.

750
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,772
SAM: Maybe we'll just do gold instead. Sorry, can
I have that back? Sorry.

751
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:28,333
LIAM: Smooth operator.

752
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:30,054
(laughter)

753
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:41,443
MATT: Flings it back and there is an expression
of, "Of course a gnome would do that." If this

754
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:44,933
was a Telltale game it would say, "Her hatred for
gnomes deepens."

755
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:49,130
LAURA: That's fine. (bling)

756
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:53,635
MATT: "All right." Immediately puts it into a
small shelf, writes down some remarks on it. "Very

757
00:56:53,635 --> 00:56:59,269
"well, I will show you to the Shore Shanty. Follow
me, please."

758
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:01,433
LAURA: Oh, it sounds elegant.

759
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:04,830
TRAVIS: Shanty's a fancy name for a mansion,
right?

760
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:10,154
MATT: Leads you out to one of the far end docks,
and there are a number of decent ships and larger

761
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:17,331
fishing ships, some faster-travel ships, some long
boats. You see one galleon-sized ship that's just

762
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:23,813
left and taken away, and on the far end there is
one of the shittiest tugboat-sized boats you've

763
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:30,183
seen in a while. Scanlan, you've seen boats like
this and they're largely used for either

764
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:40,047
relatively cheap and relatively quick messenger
services. A courier ship, if you will. That's

765
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:41,222
about it.

766
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:43,212
SAM: Do we need a bigger vessel?

767
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:48,551
LAURA: I have a feeling you don't believe this
ship will make it back, do you?

768
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:54,100
MATT: "Well, that would not behoove me; I wish to
keep my ships at dock where they're safe."

769
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,020
LAURA: Of course. Yep.

770
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,545
MARISHA: She's got a high-ass insurance policy on
this bitch.

771
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:01,841
TALIESIN: Clever.

772
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:08,268
MATT: "The crew is included. Go say hello. Hope to
see you back in a few days." Whips around and

773
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,216
walks her way back.

774
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:15,669
TRAVIS: Did you see her eye? It didn't move. How
does that happen?

775
00:58:15,669 --> 00:58:23,740
SAM: She seemed very pleasant. Don't know what 
Fenna was talking about. Shall we away? Do we

776
00:58:23,785 --> 00:58:26,342
need to make any preparations before we go?

777
00:58:26,342 --> 00:58:27,953
TALIESIN: I think we're ready.

778
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:30,142
SAM: Do we have all of the materials we need?

779
00:58:30,142 --> 00:58:33,725
TALIESIN: Did we get the platinum from the bank,
if I recall? I'm trying to remember.

780
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:37,840
MATT: Yeah, we'll say that that was your intent
last time, that you made the conversion to

781
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,991
platinum.

782
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:40,402
TALIESIN: We would've platinumed.

783
00:58:40,402 --> 00:58:42,003
TRAVIS: Let's meet the crew.

784
00:58:42,003 --> 00:58:45,107
MARISHA: Oh boy.

785
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:48,077
TRAVIS: How many crew are there?

786
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:57,218
MATT: There are three. Two of them appear to be
the crustiest barnacles-- The gentleman that you

787
00:58:57,218 --> 00:59:04,990
met earlier, Fenna, looks like the brother of
these two that mated. That really lived the life.

788
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:11,256
Both of these men that are inside, that're playing
cards hunched over the table, can't be younger

789
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:17,951
than their early sixties. One of them has a big,
thick, gnarled white beard that darkens at the

790
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:22,956
tips which you can only imagine, as most hair
tends to get lighter at the tips, means it's

791
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:31,941
crusted with stuff. They're both wearing general
seafaring garb and tattered clothing. They're

792
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:38,026
muscular. Their skin is very tanned. One of them's
wearing a heavy knitted cap that folds back onto

793
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:45,321
itself and rests on his shoulder to the side. They
are both playing cards and they look over. "I

794
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:51,746
"guess it's time to work." Takes the cards, pulls
them up from the table. "All right, where we

795
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:52,927
"going?"

796
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:56,575
LAURA: You strapping young lads are taking us out
to the volcano.

797
00:59:56,575 --> 00:59:58,393
TRAVIS: Yeah, Scaldseat.

798
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:03,292
MATT: Both look at each other. "All right, let's
wake up Santy."

799
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:06,042
MARISHA: Santy? Shanty.

800
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:08,124
MATT and SAM: Santy.

801
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:13,405
TRAVIS: The name of the boat is the Sea Shanty,
but the captain is Santy.

802
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:23,890
MATT: Santy of the Shanty. Technically, this is
Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty.

803
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,153
LAURA: The Shore Shanty?

804
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:26,522
MATT: Yeah. It's a mouthful.

805
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,863
LAURA: Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty? I love
it!

806
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:43,204
MATT: You watch as this large gentleman walks over
and slams his fist on this small, wooden-- ugh, my

807
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:50,225
brain isn't working. Thank you, a hatch in the
ground. "We've got customers." And you hear this

808
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:59,138
rustling beneath and all of a sudden the hatch
slams up, and barreling out from underneath you

809
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:13,368
see the drunkest, most unshaven, unwashed, gnarled
goliath you've ever seen. No facial hair, but bits

810
01:01:13,368 --> 01:01:23,020
of frizzled dark hair in the back, which is
interesting. Very few goliaths grow hair. Now

811
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:27,000
what's interesting about this, too, is the
size isn't as large as you height-wise, but width

812
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:35,858
is about matching yours, so this is a bowling ball
of a goliath. Steps up on the top. (grunts)

813
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:39,895
LAURA: Only taller.

814
01:01:39,895 --> 01:01:42,796
LIAM: A large Danny DeVito.

815
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:49,320
MATT: Actually, yeah, that's a good point. But if
Danny DeVito also was doing Iron Man competitions

816
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,279
for a number of years and then let himself go, so
he has the bulk of the muscle underneath but

817
01:01:54,279 --> 01:02:03,696
then-- Yeah. Doesn't say a word, just looks at you
all and then walks out onto the deck of the ship.

818
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:05,300
LAURA: Great.

819
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,144
TRAVIS: Can I look down into the hatch where he
came from? Can I see anything?

820
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,622
MATT: Make a perception check.

821
01:02:11,622 --> 01:02:14,184
LIAM: We're just going from point A to point B.
This is just what we need.

822
01:02:14,184 --> 01:02:15,368
TRAVIS: Two.

823
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:20,257
MATT: It is dark, but you can smell the rum.

824
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:25,215
TRAVIS: There's rum down there. Down there? There
is rum.

825
01:02:25,215 --> 01:02:30,272
MARISHA: Well, we have five miles ahead of us.

826
01:02:30,272 --> 01:02:35,865
TRAVIS: Let's get shit-housed. Who cares what our
responsibilities are?

827
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:40,836
LAURA: How long would it take to go five miles on
this fabulous ship?

828
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:46,974
MATT: Well, one of the two older gentlemen that
were there, the one that knocked on the hatch,

829
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:59,426
goes, (hums). Sticks his hand out the side of the
doorway, "Maybe two hours? Three hours?"

830
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:07,275
MARISHA: Ugh. No. I'm going to go fix with that.
Whatever. You know what I'm saying. (wind noises)

831
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:11,710
TRAVIS: We haven't even left the dock yet.

832
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:16,753
MATT: They pull the sail up, they get everything
ready, they go ahead and undock from the dock,

833
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:23,096
pull up anchor, and the general wind, because it's
cliffside here, the wind is pretty strong right

834
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:28,223
here at the bay, so immediately the sail billows
open and the ship takes off. And they begin to

835
01:03:28,223 --> 01:03:32,973
curve in the direction, loosely, of where you were
pointed earlier.

836
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:37,536
MARISHA: After those initial winds, I take them
and keep us going for a little bit.

837
01:03:37,536 --> 01:03:50,675
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye on where the
little guy said the volcano was and try to make

838
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:53,843
sure our drunk captain is taking us to the right
place.

839
01:03:53,843 --> 01:04:00,755
TRAVIS: After all, we are going on a three-hour
tour.

840
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:03,706
MARISHA: Actually, it should be only about half an
hour, now!

841
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:09,128
SAM: Ooh! There's sound effects, first of all.
Appreciate the sound effects. If we're going on a

842
01:04:09,128 --> 01:04:20,079
three-hour tour, I demand to know who's Gilligan,
who's the Skipper, millionaire and his wife. The

843
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,285
movie star--

844
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:22,405
TALIESIN: Ginger.

845
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,591
SAM: Ginger, yeah.

846
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:30,080
MARISHA: Well, then there's the Professor and Mary
Ann. Yeah. Well, you may be the Professor. So

847
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,685
maybe you're Mary Ann. Does that make me Ginger?

848
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,903
LIAM: Well, wait. Wouldn't you be Thurston Howell
III?

849
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:37,503
TALIESIN: I feel like I would really be Thurston.
I feel like Thurston's better.

850
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:41,861
MARISHA: Yeah. Actually, yeah.

851
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:43,649
LAURA: You're Mary Ann, you're Professor.

852
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:47,423
LIAM: This is going to be very helpful against
Vecna.

853
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:51,134
MATT: You're the crazy monkey on the island that
kept fucking shit up.

854
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:53,769
SAM: Little buddy!

855
01:04:53,769 --> 01:05:02,029
MATT: All right. As you set sail, the wind picks
up, speed is enhanced and you gather at this rate

856
01:05:02,029 --> 01:05:06,120
probably in under two hours you'll probably make
it to the destination with the help of the Air

857
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:06,960
Ashari--

858
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,773
MARISHA: It's a 2nd-level spell. Gust of Wind.

859
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:21,654
MATT: So as it guides on, Captain Santy stands at
the front of the ship glancing out, this giant

860
01:05:21,654 --> 01:05:29,515
square jaw just nestled right into where the pecs
meet up beneath the thick sweater that's almost

861
01:05:29,515 --> 01:05:35,430
hanging off the arms at this point. No cap,
balding head with the scraggly hair in the back,

862
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:40,243
and just looks off in the distance. The rest of
the two are just sitting back where there are

863
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:49,242
various jugs of some unseen liquid, keeping tabs on the
sail. It's a very leisurely, lackadaisical energy

864
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:50,669
on this ship.

865
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:53,519
LIAM: How many feet, I guess, is this ship from
front to back?

866
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,639
MATT: Front to back, I'd say it's about 25 feet.

867
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:58,386
SAM: We're crammed on this thing.

868
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:02,955
MATT: This is a tiny ship. It's 25 to 30 feet.

869
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:08,904
LAURA: There's no way to go any faster on this? Is
there no way to go faster, Captain?

870
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:11,298
MATT: Captain? You say this to the captain? He
goes--

871
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:22,814
LAURA: Do you go out to this volcano often?
Lovely.

872
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,398
MARISHA: Santy is so wise.

873
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,448
TRAVIS: Why do you say that?

874
01:06:27,448 --> 01:06:31,467
MARISHA: He sees the sea. Look at him.

875
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:33,508
TALIESIN: We can all see the sea. It's right
there.

876
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:36,366
MARISHA: Santy of the Shanty seas sees the sea.

877
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:47,692
MATT: And he points out and you glance out at
where Santy of the Shore Shanty is, and you can see

878
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:52,924
in the distance there's a little line of dark that
is rising out of the ocean.

879
01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:56,435
LAURA: Oh, you found it.

880
01:06:56,435 --> 01:06:59,839
TALIESIN: Santy of the Shore Shanty spotted--

881
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,784
TRAVIS: I will throw something.

882
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:06,103
MARISHA: Do you think Santy of the Shore Shanty
sells sea shells?

883
01:07:06,103 --> 01:07:09,775
TALIESIN: Surely not.

884
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,081
MATT: Rocks fall. Everyone dies.

885
01:07:13,081 --> 01:07:21,658
Quickly enough, you begin to approach and you can
now see what was a thin column is now a fairly large

886
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:28,767
billowing stream of dark fume that you can see as
the waves get larger and larger the

887
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:34,824
further out you go. Certain swells, some of it
breaks up and it chains and snakes upward, based

888
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:42,158
on how it's finding its way to the surface.
Eventually, you get within maybe 30, 40 feet of

889
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:50,013
where it breaks the surface there, and the sails
fall into loose and are tied around the bottom,

890
01:07:50,013 --> 01:07:56,234
anchor is thrown off the side, chain is let down,
and then eventually the captain turns back and--

891
01:07:56,234 --> 01:08:01,516
LAURA and SAM: All right.

892
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:09,668
TRAVIS: Jeez. Hold on. I saw you drop anchor. Do
you have an idea of how deep it is here?

893
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:23,849
MATT: Glances over the side.

894
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:32,729
LAURA: Very deep. Is your chain long enough for
your anchor to hit bottom? Cool.

895
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:35,891
LIAM: I'm sorry do you-- do you talk, ever?

896
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:44,993
MATT: As soon as you say that question, the two
other older gnarled gentlemen on the ship go

897
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:54,311
(noises of warning). Captain is just staring at
you. (spits) Spits on the ground before you.

898
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:59,255
MARISHA: I see you're also skilled in interpretive
dance. You're very good.

899
01:08:59,255 --> 01:09:04,816
TRAVIS: Oh shit. The ship will be gone when we
come back up.

900
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:08,838
LIAM: I don't wanna waste time on the gnome business.
Let's just go on.

901
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:10,899
SAM: Let's do this.

902
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:14,683
MARISHA: Water Breathing!

903
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,059
LAURA: Oh, and Trinket!

904
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:17,469
MARISHA: And Trinket. (poof)

905
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:21,307
LAURA: I had him in the necklace because it was
such a tiny little boat, but now he's out.

906
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:25,611
MATT: Yeah. All right. With that, you all have
water breathing.

907
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:29,773
LAURA: Oh wait, can he swim? He's good. He did it
before, right?

908
01:09:29,773 --> 01:09:33,778
MATT: Yeah. He's as good at swimming as half of
your party.

909
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:35,826
LAURA: He's an expert now after the kraken fight.

910
01:09:35,826 --> 01:09:37,308
SAM: What?

911
01:09:37,308 --> 01:09:40,739
TALIESIN: I'm so glad I don't have to do that. You
just do it for me. It's very nice.

912
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:48,952
MARISHA: Keyleth uses Alter Self to give herself
the gill hands. The webbed fingers again. That was

913
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:50,066
cool.

914
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:54,812
TRAVIS: You got to do a proper paddy entry into
the water. (splash)

915
01:09:54,812 --> 01:10:03,179
MATT: Perfect. As each of you make your way into
the water (splashing). You can smell, by the way,

916
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:08,453
the fumes. Because you see the dark color
of it, you immediately envision or at least

917
01:10:08,453 --> 01:10:14,574
instinctively prepare for the smell of fire smoke
or a fireplace. As soon as it hits you, it's a

918
01:10:14,574 --> 01:10:24,010
very acrid, sharp metallic smell with hints of
sulfur and other chemicals that burn the inside of

919
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:26,108
your nose and sinuses immediately.

920
01:10:26,108 --> 01:10:27,787
LIAM: In the water, going up our noses?

921
01:10:27,787 --> 01:10:33,858
MATT: It's the proximity. Being near, you can
smell occasionally as the wind blows through, a

922
01:10:33,858 --> 01:10:42,062
whiff gets to you. You all make your way under the
surface and begin to swim down, following with

923
01:10:42,062 --> 01:10:47,386
your vision where the source of this dark column
of fume is.

924
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:49,968
TRAVIS: Do we have good visibility?

925
01:10:49,968 --> 01:10:51,675
MATT: It's all right.

926
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:54,056
TRAVIS: 40 feet? 60 feet?

927
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:57,703
MATT: I'd say about 60 feet or so before it gets a
little murky.

928
01:10:57,703 --> 01:11:02,253
TALIESIN: I think I've still got one more charge
on the flashlight, if I recall.

929
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:03,769
MATT: Okay.

930
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:08,523
LAURA: The red light?

931
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:09,731
TALIESIN: Yeah.

932
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:18,606
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way... down
below. Who's leading this? I should get a marching

933
01:11:18,606 --> 01:11:20,382
order for underwater, by the way.

934
01:11:20,382 --> 01:11:21,944
LIAM: I will go ahead.

935
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,930
LAURA: I'm useless and Percy's useless
underwater.

936
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,408
TALIESIN: Extremely useless.

937
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:27,900
MATT: Percy has the light, too.

938
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,721
TALIESIN: I'll be in the middle.

939
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:33,563
MARISHA: I'll be with Percy, more up front.

940
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:34,863
MATT: All righty.

941
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:37,196
LAURA: I'll be just behind Percival.

942
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:38,699
MATT: All righty. Grog?

943
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,938
TRAVIS: Where should I be?

944
01:11:40,938 --> 01:11:43,066
MATT: You're sinking faster than most anybody.

945
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:48,131
TRAVIS: Yeah. How about I'm the down-weighter
system for whoever's in the front? I'll hold onto

946
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:49,178
their ankles.

947
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:50,601
MATT: Is Trinket in your necklace or swimming, as
well?

948
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,801
LAURA: He's out. He's swimming.

949
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:54,130
MATT: Okay, so Trinket's trying to keep up next to
you. Scanlan, where are you?

950
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,845
SAM: I'm probably next to Percy.

951
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:06,298
MATT: All right, so you guys begin making your way
down. You can breathe the water just fine as you

952
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:10,935
descend 40, 60 feet, 80 feet.

953
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,579
LAURA: I'm equalizing.

954
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,701
TRAVIS: You're breathing water. It's not
necessary.

955
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:16,446
LAURA: Really? Your ears wouldn't pop, still?

956
01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:18,178
TRAVIS: There's no air in your sinuses.

957
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:21,172
LAURA: Oh, right. Okay, cool.

958
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:26,214
MATT: It's funny. You mention equalizing, and I
can't help but try and do it myself now.

959
01:12:26,214 --> 01:12:30,951
TRAVIS: Quick question. Like in space, can we talk
underwater if there's no air going through our

960
01:12:30,951 --> 01:12:33,319
vocal cords? Cool.

961
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:36,159
LAURA: Oh, good. We can't communicate.

962
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:42,812
MATT: I'll say because you have the earring, it's
a little garbled, but you can hear it a little

963
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:43,745
bit.

964
01:12:43,745 --> 01:12:46,466
MARISHA: It's like that game we all played when we
were growing up.

965
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:57,414
MATT: You can make out the gist of things, but
depending on how fast you're talking, it could be

966
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:02,700
hard to hear. It's getting darker and darker the
further down you descend, and the water gets

967
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,374
murkier and murkier. It also gets warmer.

968
01:13:06,374 --> 01:13:08,477
TRAVIS: Stop peeing, Vax.

969
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:10,320
MATT: (chuckles) I was waiting for it.

970
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,934
LAURA: You called him Vex.

971
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:15,751
LIAM: Vax, and I said sorry at the same time, so
I'm peeing right now, is what I'm saying.

972
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:22,431
MATT: It's good. It leads you into it. Descending
further and further, the only visible light that

973
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,559
you have is the one that Percival is shining
below, and as it goes through, you can see it

974
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:34,780
reveals another 40 or so feet ahead of you, and
then as you pass over, it suddenly becomes shorter

975
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,999
and then longer again as it comes and hits the
smoke, and you can see the smoke and the fume now.

976
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:44,913
It's billowing up at a rapid pace, and the water
is getting hotter and hotter, to the point where

977
01:13:44,913 --> 01:13:47,611
now it's starting to feel like a sauna.

978
01:13:47,672 --> 01:13:51,686
LAURA: (garbled) We didn't think about fire
resistance, did we?

979
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:59,625
MATT: About another 20 or so feet, and it's hot
enough to stand, but it's getting really

980
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:08,493
uncomfortable, and with Percival's light, you can
see the bottom. (soft impact) You guys all land

981
01:14:08,493 --> 01:14:13,221
there at the bottom of the ocean. It's so dark
that outside of Percival's light and the glow

982
01:14:13,221 --> 01:14:19,750
around you, you only see the outline of each other
from the splash-back of the light as he projects

983
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,981
it around.

984
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:22,527
LAURA: Does anybody have any light?

985
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:24,420
MARISHA: I can light up my flame hands.

986
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,206
TRAVIS and MATT: You're underwater.

987
01:14:26,206 --> 01:14:28,259
MARISHA: But it's magic. I thought it doesn't
matter?

988
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:32,499
MATT: I will say, you get a little bit there, and
it's fighting against it. It's a very faint glow.

989
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:35,718
You can see where Keyleth is, but it doesn't add
any light to the rest of this.

990
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:41,650
TRAVIS and LIAM: (garbled noises)

991
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:49,070
LAURA: We really need to say stuff, though,
because no one's going to be able to understand

992
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:49,952
us.

993
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,269
(laughter)

994
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:55,846
TRAVIS: Do you see anything around us?

995
01:14:55,846 --> 01:14:59,943
MATT: Make a perception check.

996
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:02,291
TALIESIN: I may join in on that, because I have a
flashlight.

997
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,683
LIAM: 28.

998
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:09,866
MATT: You guys both have disadvantage on this, by
the way, because of the lack of visibility.

999
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:10,878
LIAM: 28.

1000
01:15:10,878 --> 01:15:13,121
LAURA: Scanlan, don't you have Dancing Lights or
anything?

1001
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:14,403
TALIESIN: 21.

1002
01:15:14,403 --> 01:15:19,190
SAM: I can make a Fireball. (garbled) I can make a
Fireball, but it will probably go out really

1003
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:20,244
quick.

1004
01:15:20,244 --> 01:15:23,110
LAURA: (garbled) Don't you have a Dancing Lights
cantrip or some shit like that?

1005
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,053
SAM: (garbled) No.

1006
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,307
LAURA: (garbled) Lame.

1007
01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:36,642
MATT: All right, so glancing down, you can see you
guys are standing on a rising upward cone; the top

1008
01:15:36,642 --> 01:15:42,672
of the volcano at this point, where you can see
all the ground below you, especially immediately

1009
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:50,578
around where the water or the fume is gushing out,
is porous, dark rock. There's no soot; there's no

1010
01:15:50,578 --> 01:15:58,668
soft surface that you hit. There's no usual bottom
of the ocean you expect. Yeah, no sediment. It's

1011
01:15:58,668 --> 01:16:05,108
just hard rock. The force of the vents seems to be
pushing any of the sediment off, and it descends

1012
01:16:05,108 --> 01:16:08,234
slowly around you and disappears into the
darkness.

1013
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:13,566
You can see a number of small-- strangely enough,
with the heat of the surrounding area, too, you

1014
01:16:13,566 --> 01:16:18,385
can see little bursts of color within the porous
rock, and with a quick glance, Vax, you can see

1015
01:16:18,385 --> 01:16:26,296
there are bits of plant life, colorful pinks and
purples that are slowly pulled into the porous

1016
01:16:26,296 --> 01:16:35,145
rock on the outside of these vents. You can see a
very faint glow in a couple of places of the rock

1017
01:16:35,145 --> 01:16:45,890
where it looks there is still some sort of very
hot, very slow pressurizing molten rock that is

1018
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:51,169
cooling slowly. It looks like there's this
constant slow battle between the ocean water and

1019
01:16:51,169 --> 01:16:52,984
whatever's forcing upward.

1020
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:58,217
MARISHA: Do I see any-- (garbled) Do I see--

1021
01:16:58,217 --> 01:16:59,998
MATT: (whispering) Don't, please.

1022
01:16:59,998 --> 01:17:02,573
(laughter)

1023
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:03,960
MATT: Please don't.

1024
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,981
LIAM: It sickens me.

1025
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:10,109
(laughter)

1026
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:17,908
MARISHA: Are there any pockets other than the main
pressure point that might be a smooth entry

1027
01:17:17,908 --> 01:17:19,826
point?

1028
01:17:19,826 --> 01:17:29,609
MATT: Right now, where it's emerging, these jets
of extremely hot fume that are billowing past you,

1029
01:17:29,609 --> 01:17:33,112
it looks like there's one concentrated opening at
the moment. As you walk around, it looks like it's

1030
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:38,331
not one central column. It looks like there's a
number of smaller fissures that are all clustered

1031
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:44,272
around this area, and it's hard to see the
separation because so much of it's mashing into

1032
01:17:44,272 --> 01:17:46,306
one giant column as it emerges.

1033
01:17:46,306 --> 01:18:01,586
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. All right, so it's hot water
and gas coming up. If I theoretically wanted to do

1034
01:18:01,586 --> 01:18:10,952
a Control Water spell and reverse the water
inwards, could we go in through one of these

1035
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,688
tunnels? Through one of these fissures?

1036
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:15,160
MATT: You can certainly try.

1037
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,831
TALIESIN: I hate that phrase.

1038
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,293
TRAVIS: You've got the Death Ward. Go for it!

1039
01:18:20,293 --> 01:18:24,833
MARISHA: I'm more thinking for all of us. I don't
know how else we're going to get in.

1040
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:32,219
LAURA: Can you make yourself a fire elemental, and
it won't damage you if you go-- or will water fuck

1041
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:33,079
with you?

1042
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:35,328
MATT: Oh, water will <i>fuck</i> with you as a fire
elemental.

1043
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:38,628
MARISHA: I could be a water elemental, though.

1044
01:18:38,628 --> 01:18:40,260
MATT: You could.

1045
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,211
TRAVIS: Should we walk around? The volcano, is it
massive?

1046
01:18:45,211 --> 01:18:50,296
MATT: You don't know. Your visibility vanishes
about 40 feet away from you.

1047
01:18:50,296 --> 01:18:54,227
LIAM: And we're just seeing little glows in the
distance?

1048
01:18:54,227 --> 01:19:02,130
MATT: You're seeing little glows within the actual
areas where the fumes are spewing up. You're

1049
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:06,534
seeing down where the smoke is emerging. You're
seeing every now and then a faint glow that

1050
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:08,088
appears here and there.

1051
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:12,709
TALIESIN: Are the faint glows repetitive, like
they're coming from the same place over and over

1052
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:13,804
again?

1053
01:19:13,804 --> 01:19:16,984
MATT: Yeah. It looks like the glow is stationary.
It's just the smoke obscuring it as it passes by

1054
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:19,020
and occasionally gives you a glimpse.

1055
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,581
TALIESIN: Let's head towards the glow.

1056
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:24,370
LAURA: Yeah. It might be magma coming out,
though.

1057
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:26,975
TRAVIS: There are tunnels that exist already.

1058
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:31,065
TALIESIN: It might be magma. Also, if we see
anything resembling an air bubble, then we know

1059
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:32,903
there's something that breathes.

1060
01:19:32,903 --> 01:19:36,373
MARISHA: If we want to wait a few minutes, I could
do a Commune With Nature.

1061
01:19:36,373 --> 01:19:39,505
LAURA: Yeah, do that. That's smart! Yeah.

1062
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:45,581
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, underwater tea
party! (glugging) And do a Commune With Nature for

1063
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:55,278
a little bit. I get three questions? I want to
find any easy tunnels.

1064
01:19:55,278 --> 01:19:57,117
LAURA: Man-made tunnels.

1065
01:19:57,117 --> 01:19:59,864
MARISHA: Man-made tunnels that aren't going to
bake us alive.

1066
01:19:59,864 --> 01:20:04,410
LAURA: Any dangerous creatures in the area.

1067
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:11,928
MARISHA: Any dangerous creatures in the area.
That's good. And the Anvil. Okay.

1068
01:20:11,928 --> 01:20:16,838
MATT: Because of the nature of this, the radius is
limited to 300 feet because it's considered a

1069
01:20:16,838 --> 01:20:19,885
somewhat underground, not out-in-the-open
setting.

1070
01:20:19,885 --> 01:20:22,230
MARISHA: All right, yeah, 300 feet.

1071
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:27,207
MATT: All right, so. You take the minute and
concentrate beneath. And with that, all of a sudden

1072
01:20:27,207 --> 01:20:31,737
you feel your conscious extend into the rock and
stone and the various forms of plant life that

1073
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:38,870
have made home around the outskirts of the top of
this volcano's caldera. Your questions are?

1074
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:47,280
MARISHA: Are there any man-made tunnels that will
grant us access into the volcano without burning

1075
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,289
us alive?

1076
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:49,305
LAURA: And where are they?

1077
01:20:49,305 --> 01:20:50,357
MARISHA: And where are they?

1078
01:20:50,357 --> 01:20:51,501
SAM: That's two questions.

1079
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:52,504
MATT: No.

1080
01:20:52,504 --> 01:20:54,504
TRAVIS: Man-made is not important.

1081
01:20:54,504 --> 01:20:55,972
SAM: How about, any tunnels?

1082
01:20:55,972 --> 01:21:02,311
MARISHA: Are there any tunnels getting into the
volcano?

1083
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:06,734
MATT: You feel the sense of the rock and the
surrounding material guide your attention, very

1084
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:10,995
focused, into the center of where that fume is
erupting.

1085
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:13,810
TALIESIN: Oh. Okay.

1086
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:22,583
LIAM: The Anvil is probably too far away at this
point. Yeah, it's probably not right here at the

1087
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:29,397
top. What about these colorful plant things
floating past us? Are they going to sting us and

1088
01:21:29,397 --> 01:21:30,484
paralyze us?

1089
01:21:30,484 --> 01:21:35,704
SAM: Should we find out, from nature, how far down
in the magma it is?

1090
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:38,255
TRAVIS: Yeah, what the location of the Anvil is?

1091
01:21:38,255 --> 01:21:40,093
MARISHA: I'm afraid that 300 feet--

1092
01:21:40,093 --> 01:21:44,048
LAURA: But maybe it'll know how far away it
is, even though it can only-- Does it work that

1093
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:45,346
way?

1094
01:21:45,346 --> 01:21:50,363
MARISHA: Within 300 feet, I can see the area.

1095
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:51,622
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1096
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:52,971
LIAM: Said the fantasy heroes.

1097
01:21:52,971 --> 01:21:57,889
MARISHA: Yeah. Hostile creatures! Hostile
creatures in the area.

1098
01:21:57,889 --> 01:21:59,979
MATT: Hostile creatures in the area?

1099
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:05,826
MARISHA: Dangerous hostile creatures. How many
more adjectives can I throw in there?

1100
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:07,007
LIAM: Pissy.

1101
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:08,968
TALIESIN: Irritated creatures.

1102
01:22:08,968 --> 01:22:11,315
TRAVIS: Starving.

1103
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:14,735
MARISHA: Do harm. Ill will.

1104
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:20,837
MATT: Terrain. Bodies of water. Prevalent plants,
minerals, animals or peoples. Powerful celestials,

1105
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:32,887
fey, fiends, elementals or undead. You do get a
very faint sense of elemental movement. You're not

1106
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:40,087
quite sure what that pertains to specifically, but
it is moving just outside the radius of your

1107
01:22:40,087 --> 01:22:47,737
sphere of understanding here at the top of the
volcano, and it is moving slowly through rock.

1108
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:50,842
LAURA: There you go.

1109
01:22:50,842 --> 01:22:53,202
SAM: Through rock.

1110
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,472
MARISHA: Earth elemental.

1111
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:57,546
LAURA: So we need to go in the top, yeah?

1112
01:22:57,546 --> 01:23:02,376
TRAVIS: Or through rock. You can make tunnels,
right?

1113
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:05,423
MARISHA: I can make tunnels.

1114
01:23:05,423 --> 01:23:11,002
TRAVIS: I would prefer to do that than go down the
barrel of the shotgun, but that's just me.

1115
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:15,338
SAM: Travis, can you say that with your finger
flapping on your mouth please?

1116
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:16,308
TRAVIS: (garbled) No.

1117
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:19,194
(laughter)

1118
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:23,754
MARISHA: Are we concerned if I start boring
tunnels into the side of this that magma and

1119
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:25,515
pressure will start releasing out the side?

1120
01:23:25,515 --> 01:23:26,942
TRAVIS: I'm just saying.

1121
01:23:26,942 --> 01:23:29,190
SAM: He's just saying.

1122
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:35,399
LIAM: Vax swims down towards the cone. And I think
the last time I talked about the Deathwalker's

1123
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:38,667
Ward, I'd set it to fire, so we'll say fire.

1124
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:43,154
SAM: Immune to or resistant to?

1125
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:44,454
MATT: Resistant to.

1126
01:23:44,454 --> 01:23:46,782
MARISHA: Is my mantle helping with the heat?

1127
01:23:46,782 --> 01:23:56,105
MATT: Yeah, the heat isn't bothering you as much.
It helps with extreme heat as a general weather

1128
01:23:56,105 --> 01:24:03,398
type, but intensely dangerous heat like fire or
anything, it's not going to help you with that. So

1129
01:24:03,398 --> 01:24:05,023
you dive into the center?

1130
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:09,282
TRAVIS: Yeah, I forgot. He's like a crash test
dummy. We'll worry about that later.

1131
01:24:09,282 --> 01:24:15,016
MATT: You watch as Vax disappears into the liquid.
The pressure is a lot. I need you to make an

1132
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,331
athletics check first.

1133
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:24,678
LIAM: Okay, that's what I'm best at. Athletics.
Natural 20. Thanks, Matt Colville.

1134
01:24:24,678 --> 01:24:31,034
MATT: You swim down into the darkness and you're
using your sense of balance to keep tabs on what is

1135
01:24:31,034 --> 01:24:37,201
up and what is down, because once you dive into
the middle of this pillar you see nothing. And you

1136
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:41,841
begin to swim down, feeling for where the gravity
is pulling you and the force against you, and use

1137
01:24:41,841 --> 01:24:43,407
that to get your bearings.

1138
01:24:43,407 --> 01:24:47,683
LIAM: I know it's probably fuck-all, but I'm going to
pull out the Flametongue Dagger and try to use

1139
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,087
it as a shitty-ass--

1140
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:52,702
MATT: You can faintly see a little bit of it
there. You do take three points of fire damage as

1141
01:24:52,702 --> 01:25:00,845
soon as you enter the water, reduced to one. So
you manage to push through and descend about 15 or

1142
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:07,507
so, 20 feet. You suffer another six points of fire
damage, reduced to three. Need you to make

1143
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:11,443
another athletics check, please, as you're pushing
further and further down.

1144
01:25:11,443 --> 01:25:18,501
LIAM: Use my first Luck of the day. Oh, not good.
Same thing. Just a six.

1145
01:25:18,501 --> 01:25:23,229
MATT: A six? It begins to push you up, you
lose a little bit of ground. You take another

1146
01:25:23,229 --> 01:25:31,137
one point of fire damage. You begin to make up,
and you get partway down. You get another 40 or so

1147
01:25:31,137 --> 01:25:35,795
feet down into it, you think. Still unable to
really see anything. Occasionally, you see a glint

1148
01:25:35,795 --> 01:25:40,518
of that light that you saw before. The little bit
of glow. You take another three points of fire

1149
01:25:40,518 --> 01:25:49,137
damage, reduced to one. It is a lot of heat, but
you continue to push further. Make another

1150
01:25:49,137 --> 01:25:51,429
athletics check, a third one.

1151
01:25:51,429 --> 01:25:53,496
LIAM: 20, total.

1152
01:25:53,496 --> 01:26:00,045
MATT: 20? (grunting) Pushing along, still making
your way down, making your way down. You get

1153
01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:05,467
probably another 80 or so feet before it seems to
curve off a little bit to the side. The force of

1154
01:26:05,467 --> 01:26:14,462
the water begins to shift a little bit. You take
another three points of fire damage. You begin to

1155
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:19,833
see a faint bit of that glow that you were
following earlier, and as you head towards it the

1156
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:25,054
heat gets more and more intense. You begin to push
past some of the smoke, and you can see right

1157
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:32,300
there, looks like there's a glowing ember of rock
about five or six feet wide that is molten rock

1158
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:39,731
that is slowly cooling as it's being pushed
faintly out, but the force of the water curves off

1159
01:26:39,731 --> 01:26:44,260
to the side and you continue to swim away from
where that glowing ember is and following the path

1160
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:48,693
of where this push of water is. You take another
two points of fire damage.

1161
01:26:48,693 --> 01:26:58,352
LIAM: Okay. I'm Ed Harris, sinking down and down
and down.

1162
01:26:58,352 --> 01:27:03,564
MATT: The temperature is going up. You
continue to swim, continue to swim. Further down,

1163
01:27:03,564 --> 01:27:08,258
further down, further down. Make another athletics
check.

1164
01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:10,280
LIAM: 16.

1165
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,321
MATT: Okay. You're slowing down a bit, but
you're still getting ground. You also take another

1166
01:27:14,321 --> 01:27:22,469
three points of fire damage. This is getting
hard.

1167
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:23,740
LIAM: Yeah?

1168
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:28,643
MATT: And even your form, you're getting a little
tired, having to go against this force. And you're

1169
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:34,243
not quite sure where this is going to lead you.
You're not going to stumble across an opening

1170
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:38,342
where it's fine to walk. You're continuing to swim
down a superheated--

1171
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:42,630
LIAM: I'm going to push it just a little bit
more.

1172
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:45,022
MATT: Okay, make another athletics check.

1173
01:27:45,022 --> 01:27:48,614
LIAM: Okay. That's not good. That's a seven.

1174
01:27:48,614 --> 01:27:54,019
MATT: Okay. You get pushed back about 15 feet or
so, and you take another three points of fire

1175
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:54,852
damage.

1176
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,033
LIAM: And I'll go with it, up.

1177
01:27:56,033 --> 01:28:00,015
MATT: Okay. You ride up. Before you can get
entirely out of the column, you take another three

1178
01:28:00,015 --> 01:28:05,506
points of fire damage and eventually emerge from
the side of it. Uncomfortable.

1179
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:09,042
LIAM: Back into warm piss water, instead of
boiling hot.

1180
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:11,807
MATT: Yes, which comparatively is much more
comfortable.

1181
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:13,457
LIAM: Nope!

1182
01:28:13,457 --> 01:28:15,280
TRAVIS: What did you see?

1183
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:20,657
LIAM: I mean. You can't really understand me
though, can they? Right? It's all shit.

1184
01:28:20,657 --> 01:28:22,175
LAURA: Oh, we can understand you.

1185
01:28:22,175 --> 01:28:23,778
MATT: You have the earring on.

1186
01:28:23,778 --> 01:28:29,745
LIAM: It goes forever. I think we need to look
elsewhere. I don't think all of us are going to

1187
01:28:29,745 --> 01:28:31,699
make it down that fucking tunnel.

1188
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:33,523
MARISHA: What if I'm controlling the currents?

1189
01:28:33,523 --> 01:28:41,179
LIAM: (sighs) That would help. It was getting hot
as hell down there. I don't know. I mean, maybe a

1190
01:28:41,179 --> 01:28:44,213
quick look around the perimeter of this thing?

1191
01:28:44,213 --> 01:28:46,010
MARISHA: I didn't find anything.

1192
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:50,571
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it might be worth it. We don't
even know what the Core Anvil looks like.

1193
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:51,897
TALIESIN: We have a broom.

1194
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:53,617
LIAM: We're not going to muscle our way down.

1195
01:28:53,617 --> 01:28:55,792
LAURA: No, it doesn't do anything in-- it flies.

1196
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:57,274
TALIESIN: Does it not work underwater?

1197
01:28:57,274 --> 01:29:01,419
LAURA: I can try. But it flies.

1198
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,056
TRAVIS: I mean, no.

1199
01:29:03,056 --> 01:29:04,805
MATT: You can certainly try.

1200
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:06,822
LAURA: Yeah. It'll just sit.

1201
01:29:06,822 --> 01:29:12,773
LIAM: Well, I think we're either druiding our way
in or looking for another way in, somehow.

1202
01:29:12,773 --> 01:29:18,393
LAURA: Fuck. How long did that take?

1203
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:23,055
MATT: He was gone for about a minute. Minute and a
half.

1204
01:29:23,055 --> 01:29:27,215
SAM: I have an idea. What if I could make us a
tunnel straight down the middle? Would the heat

1205
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:36,203
kill us or would the water tamp down the heat? If
I can make a ten-foot wide tunnel all the way

1206
01:29:36,203 --> 01:29:37,854
through, down?

1207
01:29:37,854 --> 01:29:38,989
LAURA: With no water?

1208
01:29:38,989 --> 01:29:42,009
TRAVIS: It might make another exhaust port for the
heat and the water.

1209
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:45,145
MARISHA: That's what I was saying. I'm afraid of
the pressure.

1210
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:51,788
SAM: The pressure of what? Once it comes up, it
becomes rock. Oh, I see. There's more underneath.

1211
01:29:51,788 --> 01:29:54,704
TRAVIS: You didn't see tunnels, right? You didn't
see tunnels in the sides of the volcano?

1212
01:29:54,704 --> 01:29:55,782
LIAM: No.

1213
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:59,319
TRAVIS: Because we're not trying to go down, we're
trying to find the tunnels.

1214
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:00,821
SAM: What tunnels?

1215
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:02,470
TRAVIS and LAURA: There are tunnels here.

1216
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:04,922
MATT: Both Percival and Scanlan, make an
intelligence check, please.

1217
01:30:04,922 --> 01:30:09,265
SAM: Just a straight intelligence check?

1218
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:11,234
MATT: Just whatever you roll plus your
intelligence modifier.

1219
01:30:11,234 --> 01:30:12,549
SAM: Eight!

1220
01:30:12,549 --> 01:30:13,649
TALIESIN: 14.

1221
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:21,645
MATT: 14. On this discussion of burrowing deeper
within, if there were any places where you could

1222
01:30:21,645 --> 01:30:29,450
walk that were not completely filled with water,
per se, the minute you exposed it, it would

1223
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:34,630
begin to fill with water. Which means you'd have think
of a way to either plug it or just stay wherever

1224
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,139
water exists within the system beneath.

1225
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:40,735
TRAVIS: Right. I don't know if we're trying to get
to the inside of the volcano shaft.

1226
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,086
MARISHA: Our water breathing lasts for 24 hours.

1227
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:46,718
TALIESIN: Let's roll around a little bit. See if
we can see anything else.

1228
01:30:46,718 --> 01:30:50,658
LAURA: Maybe we can go around the perimeter and 
see if we can find some sort of entrance. Some

1229
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:52,199
magical-looking entrance.

1230
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:59,681
MARISHA: Scanlan, your burrowing. What means are
you using for that?

1231
01:30:59,681 --> 01:31:01,261
SAM: Magic.

1232
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:03,115
MARISHA: Touché.

1233
01:31:03,115 --> 01:31:04,988
SAM: Sorry, Miley Cyrus.

1234
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:11,732
TRAVIS: There's a chance the Core Anvil could be
made of molten rock, right? There's nothing that

1235
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:16,275
says it's a not dangerous, totally cool to be
around piece of thing.

1236
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:21,780
MARISHA: I have a feeling that's exactly what it
is. It's going to suck working around that thing.

1237
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,249
Sorry.

1238
01:31:23,249 --> 01:31:29,387
TRAVIS: I'm not worried about it. Well, we've got
to find whatever it is. We don't even know what it

1239
01:31:29,387 --> 01:31:30,645
looks like!

1240
01:31:30,645 --> 01:31:34,256
LAURA: Do you know, Percival, what it looks like?
Did you see it in your mind's eye?

1241
01:31:34,256 --> 01:31:38,181
MATT: You only have the construct of the actual
trammel, not the anvil.

1242
01:31:38,181 --> 01:31:44,592
TRAVIS: Yeah, when I was getting the upload from
Morpheus, did I see what the Core Anvil might look

1243
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:51,118
like? Or was it just like, I'm just hammering and
Rambo 2 montage music is playing.

1244
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:52,652
MATT: More that.

1245
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:53,861
MARISHA: Scanlan?

1246
01:31:53,861 --> 01:31:54,783
SAM: Yes?

1247
01:31:54,783 --> 01:31:57,342
MARISHA: Okay. Can we tag-team this?

1248
01:31:57,342 --> 01:32:00,122
SAM: All right, I can be a burrowing monster.

1249
01:32:00,122 --> 01:32:06,483
MARISHA: Okay, what if you burrow and I push the
water away--

1250
01:32:06,483 --> 01:32:07,781
SAM: Is that a spell?

1251
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:14,575
MARISHA: Yeah, Control Water. I can push it away,
and if you do that, then maybe we can all get in

1252
01:32:14,575 --> 01:32:16,925
and then maybe I can throw up a wall!

1253
01:32:16,925 --> 01:32:22,627
SAM: All right, I can burrow. You can deflect
water and stuff?

1254
01:32:22,627 --> 01:32:28,244
LAURA: Through the mountain? Through the volcano,
instead of down the top, like he just did.

1255
01:32:28,244 --> 01:32:29,912
SAM: Whatever you want.

1256
01:32:29,972 --> 01:32:33,592
MARISHA: Or I can control the currents and suck us
all right through down the top.

1257
01:32:33,592 --> 01:32:35,537
TALIESIN: I like "control the currents." I don't
know.

1258
01:32:35,537 --> 01:32:40,384
SAM: But the currents can't go down because stuff
is coming out, no?

1259
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:44,453
MARISHA: As part of Control Water, I can reverse
the currents.

1260
01:32:44,453 --> 01:32:46,417
SAM: But you can't control the lava coming up.

1261
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:49,378
MARISHA: No, it's water and gas and pressure.

1262
01:32:49,378 --> 01:32:51,931
SAM: Oh, it's just gas. It's not lava.

1263
01:32:51,931 --> 01:32:55,979
MATT: You can also part water, don't forget, as a
part of this, too. You can also part water.

1264
01:32:55,979 --> 01:33:00,628
MARISHA: I can also part water, like fucking
Moses.

1265
01:33:00,628 --> 01:33:04,117
MATT: Yeah, or redirect flow. Or create a
whirlpool. There are all things you can do.

1266
01:33:04,117 --> 01:33:05,957
LAURA: Solid, then let's try it.

1267
01:33:05,957 --> 01:33:13,448
LIAM: What were you thinking? Were you thinking of
Umbrasyling this shit, were you going to black

1268
01:33:13,448 --> 01:33:14,760
dragon dig your way down?

1269
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:21,532
SAM: I was going to become a purple worm. They're
excellent at burrowing and are big and could make

1270
01:33:21,532 --> 01:33:22,629
a big tunnel.

1271
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:24,874
LAURA: Are they resistant to water and heat?

1272
01:33:24,874 --> 01:33:27,487
SAM: No, but they are stacked with hit points.

1273
01:33:27,487 --> 01:33:28,607
LAURA: Solid.

1274
01:33:28,607 --> 01:33:32,712
MARISHA: That would be one of your top-level
spells, yeah?

1275
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:34,458
SAM: The toppest.

1276
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:42,900
LAURA: Let's not do that just yet. Let's control
current and see if we can fucking do it, with some

1277
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,361
light this time.

1278
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:48,870
TRAVIS: We need a walk. Walk the perimeter

1279
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:54,162
MARISHA: I mean, we can still walk the perimeter
if you want.

1280
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:57,739
LIAM: I mean, we got a little under 24 hours. Fuck
it, let's look.

1281
01:33:57,739 --> 01:33:59,200
MARISHA: We can walk the perimeter

1282
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,904
TALIESIN: Let's do a little walk of the perimeter,
and when we're ready, we're going to jump down and

1283
01:34:00,904 --> 01:34:02,366
we'll Mary Poppins it.

1284
01:34:02,366 --> 01:34:05,255
MATT: Okay, so you guys begin to make your way
around, spiraling the outside of this.

1285
01:34:05,255 --> 01:34:07,267
TALIESIN: Looking, using the light.

1286
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:09,360
MATT: Okay, what are you looking for?

1287
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:16,221
TALIESIN: I'm looking for other expelling gasses,
interesting plant growth, lights.

1288
01:34:16,221 --> 01:34:18,863
LIAM: Anything that looks not-natural.

1289
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:20,130
TRAVIS: Yeah, caves.

1290
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,754
MATT: Okay, everyone who's looking, make an
investigation check.

1291
01:34:22,754 --> 01:34:26,508
MARISHA: Investigation? Natural 20.

1292
01:34:26,508 --> 01:34:28,395
(cheers)

1293
01:34:28,395 --> 01:34:32,225
TRAVIS: Oh, minus two. 17.

1294
01:34:32,225 --> 01:34:33,692
TALIESIN: 14.

1295
01:34:33,692 --> 01:34:35,352
LIAM: 18.

1296
01:34:35,352 --> 01:34:36,818
LAURA: Ten.

1297
01:34:36,818 --> 01:34:44,772
MATT: As you guys are glancing about, for over the
next 15 or so minutes, just swimming around and

1298
01:34:44,772 --> 01:34:49,825
keeping an eye out there, Keyleth, with your
glowing hands and cruising across as you head

1299
01:34:49,825 --> 01:35:01,189
down, you can feel a couple of other small changes
in the current. Less of a fume release, more than

1300
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:06,540
there is a warmer area of water in a small area
and you find there is a pressurized jet of water

1301
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:11,079
coming out of one section maybe about 25 to 30
feet down on the side.

1302
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:14,748
LAURA: Hey! You're smart, Grog!

1303
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:17,964
MARISHA: How big is the jet?

1304
01:35:17,964 --> 01:35:21,880
MATT: I'd say it's between about three feet long
on one side and about a foot long on the other.

1305
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,056
It's a fissure.

1306
01:35:24,056 --> 01:35:27,127
LAURA: So we can get through it?

1307
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:28,912
MARISHA: Yeah, can Grog fit?

1308
01:35:28,912 --> 01:35:30,077
MATT: No.

1309
01:35:30,077 --> 01:35:31,527
MARISHA: Okay.

1310
01:35:31,527 --> 01:35:34,791
TALIESIN: But can Trinket fit?

1311
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:40,426
MATT: No, Trinket or Grog, neither of them can
fit. Most of you guys have to squeeze through, and

1312
01:35:40,426 --> 01:35:43,708
it's as hot as the water that was coming out of
the top.

1313
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:49,307
MARISHA: Is it made out of stone? Can I call this
earth? Can I call this rock?

1314
01:35:49,307 --> 01:35:51,744
MATT: It's considered rock. It's volcanic rock.

1315
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:53,754
MARISHA: So Move Earth would not work?

1316
01:35:53,754 --> 01:35:57,485
TALIESIN: Or Grog can punch it.

1317
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,119
LAURA: Yeah, Grog can punch.

1318
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,702
MARISHA: You are good at destroying structures.

1319
01:36:02,702 --> 01:36:04,926
SAM: You're going to punch a volcano?

1320
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:09,150
MATT: Yeah, dirt, sand, or clay, so I'm going to
say no.

1321
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:16,820
MARISHA: Can I transmute the rock into dirt or
sand to give us a little more?

1322
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,856
MATT: If you have a means of doing that, you
could.

1323
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:23,001
MARISHA: I have Transmute Rock. Or we can let Grog
go first.

1324
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:25,374
TALIESIN: Let's let Grog punch a volcano.

1325
01:36:25,374 --> 01:36:26,945
MATT: You want to punch a volcano?

1326
01:36:26,945 --> 01:36:28,352
TRAVIS: Kind of.

1327
01:36:28,352 --> 01:36:30,235
TALIESIN: Teach it to say your name!

1328
01:36:30,235 --> 01:36:31,983
MATT: Roll a strength check.

1329
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:33,785
TRAVIS: (garbled) Say my name, bitch!

1330
01:36:33,785 --> 01:36:38,025
LAURA: Don't you get advantage?

1331
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:39,871
TRAVIS: I do. Only if I'm raging.

1332
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:43,456
MATT: I'll give you advantage on this because it's
a volcano punch.

1333
01:36:43,456 --> 01:36:48,899
TRAVIS: Hey! Oh, 26.

1334
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:50,897
LAURA: Don't you get advantage because of your
gauntlets?

1335
01:36:50,897 --> 01:36:54,561
MATT: Well, no. The gauntlets don't give him
advantage, but they do give him siege and he does

1336
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:59,092
double damage against structures and I'll consider
this a natural structure. You rear back, and as

1337
01:36:59,092 --> 01:37:07,892
you do, you guys watch. You haven't really watched
him use this type of power in the dark before, and

1338
01:37:07,892 --> 01:37:13,920
you watch as the faint bit of a few yellow runes
glow as he pulls back and then slams into the side

1339
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,637
and you watch as rock breaks and bits of the
volcanic rock break off and begin to tumble down

1340
01:37:20,637 --> 01:37:25,112
the sides. He punches again and punches again and
as you do watch the water flow, you feel the

1341
01:37:25,112 --> 01:37:31,596
warmth come up. You immediately take six points of
fire damage from the heated jet in front of you,

1342
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:36,998
but as you slam it one more time, part of it (rock
collapsing) gives away underneath as one side of

1343
01:37:36,998 --> 01:37:45,042
it begins to jet up, you watch as it looks like there
is a gap or an air pocket that collapses inward

1344
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:47,320
and the water begins to fill in immediately.

1345
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,756
LAURA: Let's get in quick and then cover it. We go
fast, go in.

1346
01:37:50,756 --> 01:37:54,517
MATT: Okay. You guys are all fighting against the
current?

1347
01:37:54,517 --> 01:37:57,256
LAURA: Well, didn't you say there was an air pocket?

1348
01:37:57,256 --> 01:38:01,161
MATT: Well there was an air pocket that you saw,
but the stone as he punched in, as soon as it

1349
01:38:01,161 --> 01:38:06,675
collapsed inward it was away from where the jet
was. It's a very interesting thing to try and

1350
01:38:06,675 --> 01:38:08,850
describe here in a theater of mind scenario.

1351
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:13,458
MARISHA: We're trying to go through an outward jet
to this caved-in air pocket.

1352
01:38:13,458 --> 01:38:17,519
MATT: Yeah, essentially you've opened up where
the jet's strength has diminished a little bit at

1353
01:38:17,519 --> 01:38:23,714
the surface at this point, and you've watched as
you've punched and there will be another chamber

1354
01:38:23,714 --> 01:38:28,870
below that was an air chamber collapsed inward,
and ocean water is rushing into it right now.

1355
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:34,090
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Let me Control Water with the
current, and can I redirect the current up and

1356
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:36,191
around us to allow us to get in?

1357
01:38:36,191 --> 01:38:44,481
MATT: Okay, so Control Water takes an action to
cast. So as soon as that happens, you finish the

1358
01:38:44,481 --> 01:38:49,408
spell and as the ocean water begins to rush in
(water rushing), it immediately pulls back out,

1359
01:38:49,408 --> 01:38:55,830
and you can actually stop the current that's
blowing upward and heated water is held in place,

1360
01:38:55,830 --> 01:39:01,846
and you can look down below. The water is this
slightly shimmering barrier and there is a

1361
01:39:01,846 --> 01:39:03,151
small air-filled chamber below.

1362
01:39:03,332 --> 01:39:07,104
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, I'm pushing the water,
parting it, giving us a little.

1363
01:39:07,104 --> 01:39:09,840
SAM: Can we fit through whatever hole there is?

1364
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:16,181
MATT: Actually, looking down inside, it looks to
be roughly 20 or so feet wide on almost any other

1365
01:39:16,181 --> 01:39:20,091
side, and it looks to be that there's a small,
still pool that is there in the ground. It's a

1366
01:39:20,091 --> 01:39:21,561
small air pocket.

1367
01:39:21,561 --> 01:39:22,828
LAURA: Yeah, I go in after him.

1368
01:39:22,828 --> 01:39:26,531
MATT: Okay, you all rush inside there. You land
past it and it's about a 15 foot drop, you all

1369
01:39:26,531 --> 01:39:30,502
land on your feet or stumble off to one side and
catch yourself, but you're now in this chamber

1370
01:39:30,502 --> 01:39:31,455
beneath.

1371
01:39:31,455 --> 01:39:34,294
SAM: And the only thing keeping the water from
rushing in here is Keyleth?

1372
01:39:34,294 --> 01:39:35,555
MATT: Keyleth currently, yeah.

1373
01:39:35,555 --> 01:39:43,659
LAURA: I like how everything is like, "Keyleth can
do this." Can you wall it off with Create Wall?

1374
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:45,716
SAM: Well, not while casting this spell.

1375
01:39:45,716 --> 01:39:51,512
MARISHA: All right, push the water, Wall of Stone
(boom).

1376
01:39:51,512 --> 01:39:56,264
MATT: As soon as the water pushes away, it begins
to pull back, and immediately you can hear the

1377
01:39:56,264 --> 01:40:01,562
rush of the ocean suddenly, oppressively, darting
downward to fill the space where you are and then

1378
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:08,352
with that, (slamming) you watch as volcanic stone
stretches out and slams shut. You're now in a

1379
01:40:08,352 --> 01:40:16,658
pitch-black room except for the surface of his
light and the glowing of Keyleth's hands.

1380
01:40:16,658 --> 01:40:18,936
LAURA: Yay! Which are brighter now because we're
not in water.

1381
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,088
MARISHA: Oh!

1382
01:40:20,088 --> 01:40:22,397
TALIESIN: Ow, my ears popped.

1383
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:23,721
SAM: That was amazing!

1384
01:40:23,721 --> 01:40:25,084
LAURA: That was fucking sick!

1385
01:40:25,084 --> 01:40:27,379
MARISHA: You punched a volcano!

1386
01:40:27,379 --> 01:40:30,719
TRAVIS: I did, didn't I? Grog versus the volcano!

1387
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:37,943
MATT: As you guys have this conversation, you're
talking, and sounds are happening, everything's

1388
01:40:37,943 --> 01:40:41,598
fine. But, (exhales) breath is hard.

1389
01:40:41,648 --> 01:40:43,797
MARISHA: Oh, oxygen?

1390
01:40:43,797 --> 01:40:45,417
SAM: Or poison?

1391
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:47,040
TRAVIS: Air pocket.

1392
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:56,570
MATT: All of the air in here is poisoned. There is
no oxygen in this room. There is that pool of

1393
01:40:56,570 --> 01:41:02,136
water in the center, maybe four-foot wide, and you
can see it's kind of bubbling a bit, like whatever

1394
01:41:02,136 --> 01:41:04,520
the fume is that's filled the space is--

1395
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,268
LIAM: How does Heroes' Feast factor into this?
Heroes' Feast. Doesn't that guard against poison?

1396
01:41:09,268 --> 01:41:14,074
MATT: You're not poisoned. You're not having toxic
shock and dying right now, but you're

1397
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:15,969
suffocating.

1398
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:18,537
TALIESIN: I'm going to put my face in the water
and breathe.

1399
01:41:18,537 --> 01:41:20,289
MATT: It's not affecting you. You're fine.

1400
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:21,767
LAURA: Oh, because you don't breathe.

1401
01:41:21,767 --> 01:41:22,851
SAM: You're already dead.

1402
01:41:22,851 --> 01:41:24,224
MARISHA: Weirdo.

1403
01:41:24,224 --> 01:41:26,552
TRAVIS: Yeah, put your face in the water and
breathe.

1404
01:41:26,552 --> 01:41:28,441
TALIESIN: I'm putting my face in the water and
attempting to take a breath.

1405
01:41:28,441 --> 01:41:34,391
MATT: The bubbling of air there is the same fume
here.

1406
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:37,311
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to use the water
breath.

1407
01:41:37,311 --> 01:41:41,458
MATT: Oh, the water breath itself? Oh, with the
water breathing? The water you can breathe.

1408
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:45,441
LAURA: Oh, great! So any time we need a breath we
just breathe, okay!

1409
01:41:45,441 --> 01:41:48,319
TALIESIN: We might start getting a little loopy if
we stay out here for too long.

1410
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:52,903
TRAVIS: Vex, will you look for anything that looks
like a Core Anvil? And I stick my face in.

1411
01:41:52,903 --> 01:41:56,069
LAURA: I take a breath and I start looking for a
door or any way out of this.

1412
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:58,804
TALIESIN: I'm going to open the light fully.

1413
01:41:58,804 --> 01:42:03,352
LIAM: Flametongue Dagger is out so I can see the
non-water portion.

1414
01:42:03,352 --> 01:42:05,708
MATT: Okay.

1415
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:06,973
LAURA: 18.

1416
01:42:06,973 --> 01:42:09,867
MATT: 18. You go in and take a breath and you look
down below, especially with the light and the lamp

1417
01:42:09,867 --> 01:42:14,881
that's going around, you can see where this is
happening, this little pool, it's another

1418
01:42:14,881 --> 01:42:18,091
small tube that descends farther and curves away
out of sight.

1419
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:21,018
LAURA: (gasps) Is it wide enough for all of to fit
through?

1420
01:42:21,018 --> 01:42:23,685
MATT: Well, from what you can see before it curves
off, it looks like it could probably fit

1421
01:42:23,685 --> 01:42:24,639
everybody.

1422
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,362
LAURA: Hey! There's a tunnel down there!

1423
01:42:27,362 --> 01:42:31,501
TALIESIN: I'm going to tilt the light into it and
take a look down.

1424
01:42:31,501 --> 01:42:38,466
MATT: Okay. Looking down, it does; it's a curvature
off, it looks like at one point there was some

1425
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:42,729
sort of an escape, or at least that jet that you
originally found earlier? Part of it got blocked

1426
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:48,055
off and while the get of water continued, the
opening here kind of got covered with some sort of

1427
01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:54,260
liquid rock and it created this pocket. You can
swim down there. Who knows where it leads, but it

1428
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:57,472
does not appear to have any sort of a forceful
jet.

1429
01:42:57,472 --> 01:43:03,997
SAM: It's a tube? We're in one of the cow's
stomachs.

1430
01:43:03,997 --> 01:43:05,538
MATT: Essentially.

1431
01:43:05,538 --> 01:43:11,893
MARISHA: Control Water lasts up to ten minutes, so
if we want to commit to this, I can help jettison

1432
01:43:11,893 --> 01:43:13,181
us there.

1433
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:15,327
MATT: You have to cast it again, though, because
you lost concentration.

1434
01:43:15,327 --> 01:43:16,559
MARISHA: Why?

1435
01:43:16,559 --> 01:43:18,818
TRAVIS: Because you made a Wall of Stone.

1436
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:23,951
MARISHA: We decided early on that Wall of Stone
was instantaneous. And permanent.

1437
01:43:23,951 --> 01:43:27,454
MATT: Permanent and concentration. Yeah, okay,
I'll let you go with that.

1438
01:43:27,454 --> 01:43:31,604
MARISHA: Because it was in Pathfinder.

1439
01:43:31,604 --> 01:43:34,517
TRAVIS: Do we want to get rid of the water,
though? Because that's what's allowing us to

1440
01:43:34,517 --> 01:43:35,635
breathe.

1441
01:43:35,635 --> 01:43:41,527
MARISHA: The water? Just happens. Us breathing
water is good for 24 hours.

1442
01:43:41,527 --> 01:43:45,090
SAM: But if we get rid of the water, then we won't
have anything to breathe.

1443
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:48,671
MARISHA: No, I'm going to Control Water, and I'm
going to jettison us with the current.

1444
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:50,491
SAM: Okay, go for it.

1445
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:56,451
LAURA: Let's take it a little slow because we
don't know what we're coming up to, though. I

1446
01:43:56,451 --> 01:43:58,463
don't want to jump full-force into--

1447
01:43:58,463 --> 01:44:00,843
MARISHA: Yeah. It'll be like Lazy River.

1448
01:44:00,843 --> 01:44:03,634
LAURA: Something like that. Lead the way,
darling.

1449
01:44:03,634 --> 01:44:09,156
MATT: Well, how the spell works is if you maintain
concentration for the whole duration, it becomes

1450
01:44:09,156 --> 01:44:10,326
permanent.

1451
01:44:10,326 --> 01:44:12,319
MARISHA: For the whole duration?

1452
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:14,183
MATT: For the whole duration. Which is ten
minutes.

1453
01:44:14,183 --> 01:44:19,460
MARISHA: But I haven't done that because I've
already jettisoned this one water, and then now

1454
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,149
I'm trying to use the remaining--

1455
01:44:21,149 --> 01:44:23,038
MATT: It's fine. Don't worry about it.

1456
01:44:23,038 --> 01:44:30,597
LAURA: Let's just go in the water. I follow him.
Although Percy should technically be up front

1457
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,164
because he's got light.

1458
01:44:32,164 --> 01:44:35,756
MATT: Okay, so Percival goes first, followed by
Vax, then Vex.

1459
01:44:35,756 --> 01:44:37,448
TRAVIS: Me in the middle.

1460
01:44:37,448 --> 01:44:41,307
MATT: Grog. Is Trinket still swimming along with
you?

1461
01:44:41,307 --> 01:44:42,864
LAURA: Trinket is behind Grog.

1462
01:44:42,864 --> 01:44:48,534
MATT: All right. And then that's Scanlan and
Keyleth at the very end. All right. You guys dive

1463
01:44:48,534 --> 01:44:58,846
past under the water. It curves, and you can see
there's a faint light source in the distance. This

1464
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:05,153
curves below. It splinters downward and then
curves up slightly, and that's where the light

1465
01:45:05,153 --> 01:45:06,374
source is coming from.

1466
01:45:06,374 --> 01:45:08,167
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course. Air pocket.

1467
01:45:08,167 --> 01:45:10,440
LIAM: I'm going to go stealth.

1468
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,921
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1469
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:14,012
TRAVIS: Do your Navy SEAL shit.

1470
01:45:14,012 --> 01:45:15,159
LIAM: That's fine.

1471
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:17,022
TRAVIS: Come out of the water, eyes open.

1472
01:45:17,022 --> 01:45:18,802
LIAM: 34.

1473
01:45:18,802 --> 01:45:21,373
SAM: 34? Jesus.

1474
01:45:21,373 --> 01:45:23,339
MATT: All right. You think you're pretty stealth.

1475
01:45:23,339 --> 01:45:26,024
LIAM: I think I'm pretty stealth.

1476
01:45:26,024 --> 01:45:27,415
MATT: You think you're pretty stealth.

1477
01:45:27,415 --> 01:45:29,887
LIAM: All right.

1478
01:45:29,887 --> 01:45:30,858
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he said that.

1479
01:45:30,858 --> 01:45:31,612
LAURA: I know!

1480
01:45:31,612 --> 01:45:32,636
MATT: Go upward?

1481
01:45:32,636 --> 01:45:33,559
LIAM: Yeah.

1482
01:45:33,559 --> 01:45:37,669
MATT: Okay. As you get up, you see a familiar
orangeish-red glow, and as you see the surface of

1483
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:43,699
water above you, there's another, looks like an
air pocket. You emerge. You look about, and it

1484
01:45:43,699 --> 01:45:47,505
looks like there is another tunnel here, but
there's a faint glow. It looks like there are

1485
01:45:47,505 --> 01:45:56,769
small veins of cooling volcanic rock in this area.
The tunnel continues. There's actually ground that

1486
01:45:56,769 --> 01:45:59,531
you can walk on that continues down and curves out
of the way.

1487
01:45:59,531 --> 01:46:01,524
TRAVIS: The walls are cooling?

1488
01:46:01,524 --> 01:46:08,300
LIAM: I just turn to the group and I'm going to--

1489
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,568
LAURA: Can you see by the light of the magma?

1490
01:46:10,568 --> 01:46:17,417
MATT: You can see fairly, with your elven vision,
yeah, and with your dagger. So yeah, you begin to

1491
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:26,117
walk on the surface. The surface is cooled, and
it's very hot in here. But not painfully so, like

1492
01:46:26,117 --> 01:46:32,339
when you dove into the caldera itself. You walk
down about ten or 15 feet and you see it's now

1493
01:46:32,339 --> 01:46:38,182
breaking off in various directions. You can see
small pockets where it closes off, areas where it

1494
01:46:38,182 --> 01:46:46,636
looks like whatever air or gases were trapped up
when parts of the volcano would expand and

1495
01:46:46,636 --> 01:46:55,627
pressurize upward, it would trap these areas. But
you see areas where liquid rock are spilling into

1496
01:46:55,627 --> 01:47:00,334
and creating small pools. And it continues to
descend, almost like a curved spiral, around the

1497
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:01,310
way.

1498
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:03,792
LIAM: So there's a walkway, but there's also
lava?

1499
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:08,880
MATT: Very faint trickles, and cools slowly on the
floor.

1500
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,899
LIAM: I've only gone about 20 feet at this point,
is that right? I am going to go around the bend.

1501
01:47:11,899 --> 01:47:13,748
Continuing quietly.

1502
01:47:13,748 --> 01:47:20,716
MATT: You go around the bend, and you can hear
faintly the rushing of water, muffled. You're not

1503
01:47:20,716 --> 01:47:27,684
that far away, you gather, from spatial awareness
as to where the heavy pressure of the water that

1504
01:47:27,684 --> 01:47:32,775
was forced upward, you can faintly feel the
vibration. But as you curve away it gets dimmer

1505
01:47:32,775 --> 01:47:37,149
and dimmer, as you spiral off further away from
the center of this volcano. And as it continues to

1506
01:47:37,149 --> 01:47:45,201
spiral downward, this natural air pocket cavern,
it splits again into a small opening where it's

1507
01:47:45,201 --> 01:47:55,883
settled, faintly orange glowing, with spots of
black molten rock that's slowly cooling. The path

1508
01:47:55,883 --> 01:48:01,856
curves around the way, and it splits into two
pockets of this cooling rock. And then maybe about

1509
01:48:01,856 --> 01:48:05,331
a five-foot leap to continue downward.

1510
01:48:05,331 --> 01:48:08,191
MARISHA: Over lava?

1511
01:48:08,191 --> 01:48:09,814
MATT: Your favorite.

1512
01:48:09,814 --> 01:48:12,332
MARISHA: So bad at it.

1513
01:48:12,332 --> 01:48:13,702
MATT: I know.

1514
01:48:13,702 --> 01:48:15,919
LIAM: I'm going to double back to the group.

1515
01:48:15,919 --> 01:48:20,386
TALIESIN: I think we're already starting to make
our way out.

1516
01:48:20,386 --> 01:48:24,629
LIAM: It goes a little further, but I just didn't
want to go too far on my own.

1517
01:48:24,629 --> 01:48:26,501
LAURA: What did you see?

1518
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:31,280
LIAM: Just goes further. But I don't want to get
separated completely, so come up a bit, and I'll

1519
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,436
go a little bit further.

1520
01:48:32,436 --> 01:48:40,393
SAM: Can we walk on it? Is it going to burn our
little feetsies? Or do we need to fly?

1521
01:48:40,393 --> 01:48:42,216
LIAM: I don't think so.

1522
01:48:42,216 --> 01:48:45,736
LAURA: Up and over. Let's-- yeah. Let's go up
there.

1523
01:48:45,736 --> 01:48:47,340
TRAVIS: We follow Vax.

1524
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:55,710
LAURA: Can we cast Locate Object on the anvil?
Don't you have something that sends a direct path

1525
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:57,388
to an object?

1526
01:48:57,388 --> 01:49:03,658
MARISHA: Find the Path? But I think I have to have
seen the object before. It would also burn my last

1527
01:49:03,658 --> 01:49:05,063
6th-level spell.

1528
01:49:05,063 --> 01:49:08,696
LIAM: I could do it, but you have to be familiar
with it. Being told about it doesn't count, does

1529
01:49:08,696 --> 01:49:09,872
it?

1530
01:49:09,872 --> 01:49:17,419
MATT: You don't have enough information to do
that, yeah. You guys all emerge from the water to

1531
01:49:17,419 --> 01:49:19,048
gather up with Vax.

1532
01:49:19,048 --> 01:49:21,183
LIAM: I'd like to lead them to where that jump
is.

1533
01:49:21,183 --> 01:49:25,008
MATT: Okay. As you all take a deep breath under
the water and get to the surface, you make a test

1534
01:49:25,008 --> 01:49:29,962
breath and the air in this pocket is still
poisonous and not breathable, so you guys are

1535
01:49:29,962 --> 01:49:33,560
going to have to take a deep breath under the
water and hold your breath as you make your way

1536
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,787
down that tunnel.

1537
01:49:34,787 --> 01:49:39,248
LAURA: Oh fuck. Were there any other pockets of
water along the way?

1538
01:49:39,248 --> 01:49:43,990
LIAM: Shit. Get back in the water. And I'm going
to solo go where I wasn't intending to, to see how

1539
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:48,508
far it is to get to the next bit of water. You
said it was a jump over magma?

1540
01:49:48,508 --> 01:49:49,545
MATT: Yep.

1541
01:49:49,545 --> 01:49:56,215
LAURA: Does your creepy undead brain
remember how long it takes before we die if we

1542
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:59,337
don't breathe? Do you remember that?

1543
01:49:59,337 --> 01:50:02,318
LIAM: I walk away from her, and I go down the
hall.

1544
01:50:02,318 --> 01:50:08,244
MATT: All right. It's a decent jump to get over
the lava. It's not a hard one, necessarily, but I

1545
01:50:08,244 --> 01:50:10,786
want you to make an athletics check, anyway.

1546
01:50:10,786 --> 01:50:15,311
LIAM: Ooh, better use one of my Lucks for that.
That was a one. Ooh! Six.

1547
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:16,660
MATT: Six.

1548
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,526
LIAM: Six. Burn, baby, burn.

1549
01:50:18,526 --> 01:50:20,163
MATT: Total of six?

1550
01:50:20,163 --> 01:50:22,730
LIAM: Yeah, total of six. Already used Luck; it's
done.

1551
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:24,620
MARISHA: Why does this always happen to us?

1552
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:26,320
TRAVIS: I don't know, but I love it.

1553
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:34,877
MATT: You run and make a leap, and you're pretty
sure you made it, but one foot (sizzle) right into

1554
01:50:34,877 --> 01:50:35,673
it.

1555
01:50:35,673 --> 01:50:37,159
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Is it the same foot?

1556
01:50:37,159 --> 01:50:38,276
MATT: It's the same foot.

1557
01:50:38,276 --> 01:50:41,632
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

1558
01:50:41,632 --> 01:50:44,133
MATT: Thankfully, your armor is set to resist.

1559
01:50:44,133 --> 01:50:50,319
TALIESIN: Okay, that's right. That was early on.
Wow.

1560
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:55,192
LIAM: And yet Vax ain't sweating it. Not anymore.

1561
01:50:55,192 --> 01:50:58,012
TALIESIN: It's nothing you haven't had to regrow
before.

1562
01:50:58,012 --> 01:51:00,847
LAURA: Does your Raven Queen regenerate lost
footsies?

1563
01:51:00,847 --> 01:51:10,368
MATT: What would have been 56 damage is reduced to
28 fire damage to you. You pull out real fast.

1564
01:51:10,368 --> 01:51:19,311
(sizzle, groan) It burns and burns and burns. Kick
it off. You keep walking around the curvature, and

1565
01:51:19,311 --> 01:51:30,890
it takes about two minutes or so of brisk travel
to get around the corner where you can see another

1566
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:32,695
pool of warm water.

1567
01:51:32,695 --> 01:51:34,676
LAURA: Two minutes.

1568
01:51:34,676 --> 01:51:42,433
LIAM: So I see water and I shove my face down in
it and breathe it. Who knows, with me? And I go

1569
01:51:42,433 --> 01:51:46,951
back to where I burned my fucking foot, and I go
into the earring-- I'm not going to fucking jump

1570
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:53,472
over that shit again-- tell them what I saw. Yeah,
two minutes. So deep fucking breath. Yeah?

1571
01:51:53,472 --> 01:51:55,854
LAURA: Ugh, two minutes.

1572
01:51:55,854 --> 01:51:58,543
LIAM: And when you see me, run towards me and
follow me.

1573
01:51:58,543 --> 01:52:02,563
LAURA: Yeah. All right. Grog?

1574
01:52:02,563 --> 01:52:03,564
TRAVIS: What?

1575
01:52:03,564 --> 01:52:06,369
LAURA: Are you good to run and jump over some
lava?

1576
01:52:06,369 --> 01:52:07,485
TRAVIS: Nope.

1577
01:52:07,485 --> 01:52:14,781
MATT: So as you guys are aware, you can hold your
breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus

1578
01:52:14,781 --> 01:52:16,440
your constitution modifier.

1579
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,156
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no.

1580
01:52:19,156 --> 01:52:20,643
TRAVIS: Awesome!

1581
01:52:20,643 --> 01:52:26,164
LAURA: Okay, but you were on foot. If I'm on the
broom, then maybe it wouldn't take as long,

1582
01:52:26,164 --> 01:52:27,644
potentially.

1583
01:52:27,644 --> 01:52:40,042
MATT: You were making a careful path. If you were
to continue to dash, full dash run, it would be

1584
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:41,628
close. You can try it.

1585
01:52:41,628 --> 01:52:43,372
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to put Trinket in the
necklace.

1586
01:52:43,372 --> 01:52:45,048
MATT: All right. Trinket in the necklace.

1587
01:52:45,048 --> 01:52:46,332
LAURA: Do you want to get on the broom with me?

1588
01:52:46,332 --> 01:52:48,203
TALIESIN: I've got the boots, so I was going to
use my boots.

1589
01:52:48,203 --> 01:52:49,824
LAURA: All right, anybody? Scanlan?

1590
01:52:49,824 --> 01:52:50,742
SAM: Yes, please.

1591
01:52:50,742 --> 01:52:58,316
TRAVIS: It's just a thought, but I do have the
big-ass jug that can make a big thing of portable

1592
01:52:58,316 --> 01:52:59,413
water.

1593
01:52:59,413 --> 01:53:00,963
LAURA: (gasps) Sick!

1594
01:53:00,963 --> 01:53:04,617
MARISHA: Wait, we're waterboarding ourselves?

1595
01:53:04,617 --> 01:53:09,458
TRAVIS: Well, you can breathe in that shit, right?
We won't be able to see.

1596
01:53:09,458 --> 01:53:12,492
TALIESIN: Can we fit our head in that jug?

1597
01:53:12,492 --> 01:53:14,169
MATT: Yeah, you can.

1598
01:53:14,169 --> 01:53:17,673
TALIESIN: You've just got to carry the jug, and as
long as we stick our head in the jug every time we

1599
01:53:17,673 --> 01:53:26,901
need to breathe-- you're a genius! You're a
genius! I will say that seven more times. We'll

1600
01:53:26,901 --> 01:53:28,178
space them out.

1601
01:53:28,178 --> 01:53:30,493
SAM: We might run out of water, though, because
we're breathing it in.

1602
01:53:30,493 --> 01:53:35,209
TRAVIS: You're breathing it back out. You're
recycling it. It'll get a little less oxygenated.

1603
01:53:35,209 --> 01:53:37,313
LIAM: How long does a fish live in a fish tank?

1604
01:53:37,313 --> 01:53:39,923
SAM: You're right. We're big fish.

1605
01:53:39,923 --> 01:53:41,840
LIAM: The biggest.

1606
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,893
TRAVIS: Do you want to do that?

1607
01:53:43,893 --> 01:53:45,210
SAM: Let's try it.

1608
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:48,574
TRAVIS: Salt water or fresh water? Or wine.

1609
01:53:48,574 --> 01:53:50,048
LAURA and TALIESIN: Fresh water.

1610
01:53:50,048 --> 01:53:54,508
TRAVIS: I take out the Alchemy Jug and I say,
fresh water.

1611
01:53:54,508 --> 01:53:57,333
MATT: It fills with fresh water to the surface.

1612
01:53:57,333 --> 01:53:58,757
LAURA: Try breathing it.

1613
01:53:58,757 --> 01:54:00,606
TRAVIS: Are we underwater right now?

1614
01:54:00,606 --> 01:54:02,230
TALIESIN: We'll take it out of the water.

1615
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:05,988
TRAVIS: Okay. I stick my head in it. Can I
breathe?

1616
01:54:05,988 --> 01:54:07,140
MATT: Yeah, fine.

1617
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:13,370
TRAVIS: It works. It works! I'm holding it above
the water.

1618
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:14,530
LAURA: Oh, smart.

1619
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:17,287
LIAM: I hear you can do this with a non-magical
jug, too.

1620
01:54:17,287 --> 01:54:21,521
SAM: Oh yeah. We just could have carried water in
a jug.

1621
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:23,633
TRAVIS: Don't downplay my special moment.

1622
01:54:23,633 --> 01:54:25,015
SAM: We have chalices.

1623
01:54:25,015 --> 01:54:32,051
LAURA: We do have an extra chalice. You know what?
I'm going to take the fancy chalice and-- as

1624
01:54:32,051 --> 01:54:33,267
needed.

1625
01:54:33,267 --> 01:54:35,418
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the breathing jug.

1626
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:39,501
MATT: This is the funnest work-around. I love it.

1627
01:54:39,501 --> 01:54:44,753
SAM: It's a water bong?

1628
01:54:44,753 --> 01:54:51,690
MATT: Essentially. You guys are gravity-bonging
your way through an underwater volcano. If that's

1629
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:54,886
not Vox Machina, I don't know what is.

1630
01:54:54,938 --> 01:54:59,640
TALIESIN: It's how I solve so many problems in my
life. It's the solution to half our problems.

1631
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:04,969
LIAM: We're going to try to water-bong every
combat scenario for the rest of the campaign.

1632
01:55:04,969 --> 01:55:08,373
TRAVIS: I was looking at it, and I was like, fresh
water, vinegar, oh!

1633
01:55:08,373 --> 01:55:11,827
MATT: All righty. So.

1634
01:55:11,827 --> 01:55:14,408
SAM: Don't do drugs, everyone.

1635
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:20,131
MATT: As you guys make your way around the way,
through the combination of that druid spell and,

1636
01:55:20,131 --> 01:55:27,238
strangely, Grog's ingenuity, you guys have
bypassed a fairly serious situation. You make it

1637
01:55:27,238 --> 01:55:33,658
down around the curvature of the tunnel, to where
that small lava jump is. Anybody who wants to make

1638
01:55:33,658 --> 01:55:35,801
that leap, go ahead and make an athletics check,
please.

1639
01:55:35,801 --> 01:55:37,630
LAURA: I pop Scanlan on the broom and we fly on
over.

1640
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:40,177
TALIESIN: I activated my boots and walk.

1641
01:55:40,177 --> 01:55:46,148
MARISHA: And I use my mantle, which I constantly
forget triples my jump distance.

1642
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:48,041
MATT: It does, so go ahead and make an athletics
check.

1643
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:52,500
TRAVIS: 21.

1644
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,139
MARISHA: That's not great. Acrobatics?

1645
01:55:54,139 --> 01:55:55,262
MATT: Athletics.

1646
01:55:55,262 --> 01:55:57,909
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. That's better. 15.

1647
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:05,220
MATT: 15? Yeah. You coast over. It's like a soft
Neo jump. Not quite that far, but you coast and

1648
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,479
land onto the side. Grog, what did you get?

1649
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:09,728
TRAVIS: 21.

1650
01:56:09,728 --> 01:56:15,165
MATT: 21. You guys all make it across that little
stretch of molten rock without an issue. You

1651
01:56:15,165 --> 01:56:21,967
continue around the way. Vex and Vax, as you guys
are making heavy footfalls and making some

1652
01:56:21,967 --> 01:56:26,729
distance, you begin to feel this (rumbling noise)
rumbling in the ground beneath you.

1653
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:28,188
LIAM: Oh shit.

1654
01:56:28,188 --> 01:56:31,676
LAURA: I think there's something burrowing. Or an
earthquake.

1655
01:56:31,676 --> 01:56:33,323
MARISHA: Earth elementals.

1656
01:56:33,323 --> 01:56:34,427
LAURA: Potentially.

1657
01:56:34,427 --> 01:56:36,908
MARISHA: Volcanic earth elementals.

1658
01:56:36,908 --> 01:56:38,679
LIAM: Everybody hold still for a moment.

1659
01:56:38,679 --> 01:56:40,491
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

1660
01:56:40,491 --> 01:56:41,509
MATT: Okay.

1661
01:56:41,509 --> 01:56:42,931
MARISHA: Dope.

1662
01:56:42,931 --> 01:56:45,299
MATT: I would like all of you to make a stealth
check right now.

1663
01:56:45,299 --> 01:56:48,221
TRAVIS: Oh, I think you barely got that in.

1664
01:56:48,221 --> 01:56:50,348
MATT: Barely.

1665
01:56:50,348 --> 01:56:53,202
SAM: It's plus ten?

1666
01:56:53,202 --> 01:56:54,485
MATT: Plus ten.

1667
01:56:54,485 --> 01:56:55,684
SAM: 31.

1668
01:56:55,684 --> 01:56:56,843
TALIESIN: 34.

1669
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:57,864
MARISHA: 34.

1670
01:56:57,864 --> 01:56:58,872
LIAM: 40!

1671
01:56:58,872 --> 01:57:00,643
LAURA: Wow. 25.

1672
01:57:00,643 --> 01:57:02,389
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, guys.

1673
01:57:02,389 --> 01:57:04,069
TALIESIN: Oh no. Plus ten?

1674
01:57:04,069 --> 01:57:05,159
TRAVIS: 16.

1675
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:07,801
SAM: Oh, okay, that's above something.

1676
01:57:07,801 --> 01:57:10,655
TRAVIS: I have a feeling.

1677
01:57:10,655 --> 01:57:11,901
SAM: What about Trinket?

1678
01:57:11,901 --> 01:57:13,318
LAURA: Trinket's in the necklace.

1679
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:29,320
MATT: The rumbling stops as you all quietly stand
still. You begin to get bold, to take a few more

1680
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:38,107
very faint steps on the ground. The rumbling
continues and gets louder and louder.

1681
01:57:38,107 --> 01:57:44,211
LAURA: (whispers) I get my bow ready.

1682
01:57:44,211 --> 01:57:49,706
MATT: All right. I'm going to go to break.

1683
01:57:49,706 --> 01:57:52,974
TRAVIS: Oh! You fucking didn't!

1684
01:57:52,974 --> 01:57:58,943
MATT: I'm hungry. All right. Yeah. So we'll pick
up from that rumbling here at the end of the

1685
01:57:58,943 --> 01:58:06,576
break. We'll see you guys back here in a moment.
We have quite the giveaway today. We have a

1686
01:58:06,576 --> 01:58:16,459
spalted tamarind complete dice tower system. Three
pieces from our friends at Wyrmwood. This is

1687
01:58:16,459 --> 01:58:21,545
actually, this is Percival's wood type. It's nice,
with a leather interior from our friends at Wyrmwood.

1688
01:58:21,545 --> 01:58:27,246
One lucky winner's going to get this. To enter
this, find your way to the Twitch chat. And when

1689
01:58:27,246 --> 01:58:33,370
requested during the break, go ahead and enter the
word "volcano." That will put you in the entry.

1690
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:36,920
We'll come back with a winner in a minute. We're
going to go ahead and have a quick break with some

1691
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:40,215
food, and we'll see you here in a minute, guys!

1692
01:58:40,215 --> 02:19:23,391
[break]

1693
02:19:23,452 --> 02:19:25,749
MATT: And welcome back to Critical Role.

1694
02:19:25,749 --> 02:19:28,926
TRAVIS: That was a barrage.

1695
02:19:28,926 --> 02:19:37,021
MATT: Yeah, that was making up for the beginning
of the game. We have a winner. In the chat, we

1696
02:19:37,021 --> 02:19:43,804
have johnny2x40 as the winner. Congratulations,
johnny2x40. Danoba will contact you shortly to get

1697
02:19:43,804 --> 02:19:48,441
your information, and we'll get that shipped out
to you ASAP, signed by the cast. Congratulations.

1698
02:19:48,441 --> 02:19:51,173
LIAM: The fuck was that?

1699
02:19:51,173 --> 02:19:52,662
MARISHA: I loved it so much.

1700
02:19:52,662 --> 02:19:53,974
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

1701
02:19:53,974 --> 02:20:06,263
MATT: All right. So as the rumbling continues to
grow and swell, you all hold yourselves in place.

1702
02:20:06,263 --> 02:20:17,717
(rumbling, crashing) You hear the crumbling and
crashing of stone and rock, as from the side of

1703
02:20:17,717 --> 02:20:22,893
the hallway, right next to where Grog is standing,
maybe about a foot and a half in front of him, you

1704
02:20:22,893 --> 02:20:32,230
watch some large, pointed object pierce through
the wall, maybe about nine feet tall or so, go

1705
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:39,231
(explosion) out, sending dust and rock spilling
out, and there's a faint orange glow from some

1706
02:20:39,231 --> 02:20:47,813
smooth, armored head to some large creature with a
toothy mouth that opens up and (chomping) as it

1707
02:20:47,813 --> 02:20:52,445
bites down, you see rows and rows of teeth that
are glowing orange, as bits of molten rock are

1708
02:20:52,445 --> 02:20:54,572
spilling out the sides of the mouth.

1709
02:20:54,572 --> 02:20:58,765
MARISHA: It's like 2006's The Core!

1710
02:20:58,765 --> 02:21:09,790
MATT: Yeah. I hope it's better than that. You
recognize the shape of the front, especially you,

1711
02:21:09,790 --> 02:21:12,801
Percival, as you spent some time with a creature
of a similar shape.

1712
02:21:12,801 --> 02:21:14,787
LAURA: Oh, is it a worm? A purple worm?

1713
02:21:14,787 --> 02:21:19,565
MATT: No, because it has two, big. muscular,
trunk-like arms, as it (crash crash) out in front,

1714
02:21:19,565 --> 02:21:30,244
but it has no eyes. It has the solid, armored
front, and heated edges where the plates meet. It

1715
02:21:30,244 --> 02:21:36,018
seems to be some sort of elemental-infused or
variant of the bulette that you encountered

1716
02:21:36,018 --> 02:21:43,742
before. And as it breaks through and stops, mere
inches from Grog-- turn that thing off.

1717
02:21:43,742 --> 02:21:47,617
LIAM: It talks! It's a sentient bulette!

1718
02:21:47,617 --> 02:21:49,356
SAM: Happy Birthday.

1719
02:21:49,356 --> 02:22:05,558
MATT: (snarls) Across the way, you hear a low
rumble again. (snarls) It stomps the ground. And

1720
02:22:05,558 --> 02:22:10,171
you watch, from one of the other walls,
(explosion) jutting from it, a smaller version.

1721
02:22:10,171 --> 02:22:20,123
And a second emerges. (explosion) Two children. They
both emerge, going (snarls). As you're all

1722
02:22:20,123 --> 02:22:23,110
standing there, holding perfectly still.

1723
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:26,019
SAM: They can't see us. We'll stand still and
we'll be fine, right?

1724
02:22:26,019 --> 02:22:27,764
MARISHA: Jurassic Park rules.

1725
02:22:27,764 --> 02:22:33,191
MATT: (sniffs)

1726
02:22:33,191 --> 02:22:36,120
LAURA: Oh no!

1727
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:37,459
LIAM: We could attack them.

1728
02:22:37,459 --> 02:22:41,032
LAURA: There's three of them!

1729
02:22:41,032 --> 02:22:51,896
MATT: One of them turns around, and starts walking
slowly towards the direction that Grog is.

1730
02:22:51,896 --> 02:23:06,050
The large mother. And turns, Grog, and
you have to lean back as the nose sweeps past, and

1731
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:10,125
is facing right in your direction. You can see
these large holes in the front of its armored

1732
02:23:10,125 --> 02:23:20,689
snout go (sniffing). The mouth slightly cracks
open and curls back into what you could almost

1733
02:23:20,689 --> 02:23:22,669
imagine to be a grin.

1734
02:23:22,669 --> 02:23:30,885
TRAVIS: Can I quietly go into a rage?

1735
02:23:30,885 --> 02:23:34,585
(laughter)

1736
02:23:34,585 --> 02:23:36,698
TALIESIN: You are not my parents.

1737
02:23:36,698 --> 02:23:41,784
MATT: Well, as none of you have done anything at
this point in time, I need you all to roll

1738
02:23:41,784 --> 02:23:43,309
initiative.

1739
02:23:43,309 --> 02:23:46,240
LIAM: See, that's what it was! That's what it
was!

1740
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:48,412
TRAVIS: I heard you saying it, too.

1741
02:23:48,412 --> 02:23:50,270
LAURA: You should have just done it!

1742
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:52,214
MARISHA: Do what?

1743
02:23:52,214 --> 02:23:54,332
LIAM: Don't worry about it.

1744
02:23:54,332 --> 02:23:58,669
LAURA: No!

1745
02:23:58,669 --> 02:24:00,650
TALIESIN: Goddamnit. No.

1746
02:24:00,650 --> 02:24:02,296
LIAM: Every time. Every time I do it!

1747
02:24:02,296 --> 02:24:04,066
MARISHA: Oh, your sneak attack?

1748
02:24:04,066 --> 02:24:07,982
LIAM: Yes. Fuckers.

1749
02:24:07,982 --> 02:24:17,013
MATT: So Grog, who was stopped here, was the last to
leap. Keyleth made it all the way over here.

1750
02:24:17,045 --> 02:24:24,887
LAURA: Trinket's in the necklace. We were on the
broom.

1751
02:24:24,887 --> 02:24:26,951
MATT: Broom over here.

1752
02:24:26,951 --> 02:24:29,749
MARISHA: Might still be able to do it.

1753
02:24:29,749 --> 02:24:33,511
MATT: Vax. Where were you? You were stealthed.

1754
02:24:33,511 --> 02:24:35,431
LIAM: I was near the lead.

1755
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:39,333
MATT: So you would be over here, stealthing behind
this rock.

1756
02:24:39,333 --> 02:24:41,639
SAM: What a great board!

1757
02:24:41,639 --> 02:24:51,863
LAURA: This is really cool. Oh god, it's huge!
Grog! Little baby bulette.

1758
02:24:51,863 --> 02:24:58,155
TRAVIS: It's huge.

1759
02:24:58,221 --> 02:25:02,561
LAURA: Do we remember what its weaknesses were?

1760
02:25:02,561 --> 02:25:12,588
MARISHA: I know it takes half damage, I think, to
non-magical physical attacks. He's got

1761
02:25:12,588 --> 02:25:17,382
heavily armored skin. Other than that, I don't
know.

1762
02:25:17,382 --> 02:25:30,049
SAM: Ooh! Did a new light just pop on? And another
light? For a red lava effect in my eyes?

1763
02:25:30,049 --> 02:25:36,278
MATT: Into your eyes, Sam. That's why I do this.
All right, so initiative order. 25 to 20?

1764
02:25:36,278 --> 02:25:37,931
LAURA: Oh, 20.

1765
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:41,237
MATT: 20 to 15?

1766
02:25:41,237 --> 02:25:42,232
LIAM: 17.

1767
02:25:42,232 --> 02:25:43,335
TRAVIS: 19.

1768
02:25:43,335 --> 02:25:44,679
SAM: 18!

1769
02:25:44,679 --> 02:25:48,102
LAURA: Does it realize that anybody but Grog is
there?

1770
02:25:48,102 --> 02:25:50,058
MATT: You don't know.

1771
02:25:50,058 --> 02:25:52,930
LAURA: We could have, potentially.

1772
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:58,288
MATT: All right. And you're 17, you said?

1773
02:25:58,288 --> 02:25:59,539
LIAM: 17.

1774
02:25:59,539 --> 02:26:00,767
MATT: All right.

1775
02:26:00,767 --> 02:26:06,381
SAM: Here we go. This is going to be fun.

1776
02:26:06,381 --> 02:26:08,724
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

1777
02:26:08,724 --> 02:26:09,751
MARISHA: 13.

1778
02:26:09,751 --> 02:26:13,002
TALIESIN: 12. My lowest possible initiative.

1779
02:26:13,002 --> 02:26:16,522
MARISHA: Did you roll a one?

1780
02:26:16,522 --> 02:26:18,240
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

1781
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:22,049
MATT: All righty. So top of the round, as all of
them seem to have shifted in the direction of

1782
02:26:22,049 --> 02:26:29,702
Grog, who is now quietly raging. Vex, you're up
first. What do you want to do?

1783
02:26:29,702 --> 02:26:37,676
LAURA: Oh god. I'm going to try to hit it with a
Lightning Arrow.

1784
02:26:37,676 --> 02:26:39,375
MATT: Which one?

1785
02:26:39,375 --> 02:26:40,814
LAURA: What do you mean?

1786
02:26:40,814 --> 02:26:41,983
TRAVIS: What animal?

1787
02:26:41,983 --> 02:26:43,958
LIAM: There's the mama and two babies.

1788
02:26:43,958 --> 02:26:47,206
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit the one that's
breathing on Grog.

1789
02:26:47,206 --> 02:26:49,401
MATT: All righty. So go ahead and make your
attacks.

1790
02:26:49,401 --> 02:26:53,503
TRAVIS: Yeah, provoke the thing with its teeth
closest to me. I'm just fucking with you.

1791
02:26:53,503 --> 02:26:57,691
LAURA: But it knows you're there! Maybe it doesn't
know I'm there! Plus I get a sneak attack on it,

1792
02:26:57,691 --> 02:26:59,768
because you're right next to it.

1793
02:26:59,768 --> 02:27:01,032
MATT: It's true.

1794
02:27:01,032 --> 02:27:03,030
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark it!

1795
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:04,357
MATT: Look at that!

1796
02:27:04,357 --> 02:27:06,459
LAURA: (laughs) I say!

1797
02:27:06,459 --> 02:27:08,288
MATT: She says to you!

1798
02:27:08,288 --> 02:27:09,437
LAURA: 25!

1799
02:27:09,437 --> 02:27:11,054
MATT: 25 hits.

1800
02:27:11,054 --> 02:27:20,584
LAURA: Lovely. So if that was a 3rd-level
Lightning Arrow, then that means I get 3d8

1801
02:27:20,584 --> 02:27:28,878
lightning damage in addition to my regular damage,
or is it just 3d8 lightning damage? Wait. Roll the

1802
02:27:28,878 --> 02:27:35,262
attack as normal, the target takes 4d8 lightning
damage on a hit. Oh, and every creature within ten

1803
02:27:35,262 --> 02:27:43,189
feet makes a dexterity saving throw. Okay. If I
cast it at 4th-level, so no, it's just 3rd-level.

1804
02:27:43,189 --> 02:27:48,728
MATT: So it's 4d8 lightning damage. So you made
the attack roll. It hit. So it takes that.

1805
02:27:48,728 --> 02:27:53,258
LAURA: Wow. Really? Nine plus--

1806
02:27:53,258 --> 02:27:55,358
MATT: Grog, make a dexterity saving throw,
please.

1807
02:27:55,358 --> 02:27:59,148
TRAVIS: Thank you. I have advantage on those, but
I won't need it because that was a 19.

1808
02:27:59,148 --> 02:28:07,124
LAURA: 15. It doesn't actually do my regular arrow
attack damage? It's just-- wow. My spells are

1809
02:28:07,124 --> 02:28:08,981
useless compared to my regular attacks.

1810
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:10,027
TRAVIS: 21.

1811
02:28:10,027 --> 02:28:11,607
LAURA: 15 damage.

1812
02:28:11,607 --> 02:28:17,154
MATT: All right. So 15 damage. And then 2d8 to
Grog. Roll 2d8. And you take half that because you

1813
02:28:17,154 --> 02:28:18,634
made your save.

1814
02:28:18,634 --> 02:28:22,056
TRAVIS: 19. It's right on the paper. Negative two.
Sorry.

1815
02:28:22,056 --> 02:28:24,257
LAURA: You still made your save.

1816
02:28:24,257 --> 02:28:25,954
MATT: Yeah. What's the damage?

1817
02:28:25,954 --> 02:28:26,914
LAURA: Five.

1818
02:28:26,914 --> 02:28:28,521
MATT: Five damage to you, Grog.

1819
02:28:28,521 --> 02:28:29,459
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1820
02:28:29,459 --> 02:28:30,829
MATT: Five total, or that's halved?

1821
02:28:30,829 --> 02:28:32,655
LAURA: That's five total.

1822
02:28:32,655 --> 02:28:35,326
MATT: All right, you take two points of lightning
damage. Not too bad.

1823
02:28:35,326 --> 02:28:38,358
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit it again, then.

1824
02:28:38,358 --> 02:28:44,270
MATT: Lightning Arrow-- well, no. Interesting
point of order, Lightning Arrow is a bonus

1825
02:28:44,270 --> 02:28:45,420
action.

1826
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:46,928
LAURA: Oh, and I did Hunter's Mark.

1827
02:28:46,928 --> 02:28:48,672
MATT: So no Hunter's Mark.

1828
02:28:48,672 --> 02:29:00,091
LAURA: Oh, so I did Hunter's Mark-- no. Oh. I am
never going to do spell attacks ever again. They're

1829
02:29:00,091 --> 02:29:01,772
worthless for me.

1830
02:29:01,772 --> 02:29:03,974
MATT: So no Hunter's Mark, but you hit it with the
Lightning Arrow. Next round you can worry about

1831
02:29:03,974 --> 02:29:04,771
that.

1832
02:29:04,771 --> 02:29:05,895
LAURA: Okay.

1833
02:29:05,895 --> 02:29:07,598
MATT: That's your first attack. You have your
second attack.

1834
02:29:07,598 --> 02:29:11,306
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to attack it with a
regular-ass arrow that does more damage,

1835
02:29:11,306 --> 02:29:14,711
probably-- natural 20-- than a fucking Lightning
Arrow.

1836
02:29:14,711 --> 02:29:19,730
MATT: You did not do your sneak attack damage last
round, so if you wanted to do sneak attack damage

1837
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:21,095
on this, you can.

1838
02:29:21,095 --> 02:29:22,578
LAURA: Okay. Lovely.

1839
02:29:22,578 --> 02:29:24,510
MATT: Which means you also double the sneak attack
damage.

1840
02:29:24,510 --> 02:29:42,278
LAURA: Sweet. That's seven. 14 plus eight is 22,
24, plus lightning damage. 24 plus five is 29

1841
02:29:42,278 --> 02:29:44,209
damage with a regular arrow.

1842
02:29:44,209 --> 02:29:46,097
MATT: And that's with the additional sneak
attack?

1843
02:29:46,097 --> 02:29:55,719
LAURA: Yes. No, I get two sneak attacks! Plus
another four. 29 plus four. 33.

1844
02:29:55,719 --> 02:29:58,496
MARISHA: Sneak attack that bitch!

1845
02:29:58,496 --> 02:30:00,023
MATT: 33 points of damage to it.

1846
02:30:00,023 --> 02:30:01,001
TRAVIS: Do I take that, too?

1847
02:30:01,001 --> 02:30:02,410
LAURA: No, that's regular.

1848
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:08,282
MATT: As you release the Lightning Arrow, it slams
into it. (growling) The look shoots in the

1849
02:30:08,282 --> 02:30:13,476
direction where it came from, and as it opens up
its snout to smell, you fire a second arrow into

1850
02:30:13,476 --> 02:30:23,145
its mouth, and it starts writhing in place as it
does. It shakes, and you feel the ground quake in

1851
02:30:23,145 --> 02:30:31,734
the presence, and a few rocks (impacts) from the ceiling and
the children join the wail, and they all turn in

1852
02:30:31,734 --> 02:30:34,703
your direction. You going to do anything else on
your turn?

1853
02:30:34,703 --> 02:30:36,913
LAURA: Can I get on my broom?

1854
02:30:36,913 --> 02:30:38,460
MATT: Yeah, you get on your broom?

1855
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:39,947
LAURA: I get on my broom.

1856
02:30:39,947 --> 02:30:43,010
MATT: That's all you do? All righty! Grog, you're
up.

1857
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:44,523
TRAVIS: Oh, I am, huh?

1858
02:30:44,523 --> 02:30:50,150
MATT: At the beginning of your turn, the heat
emanating from this bulette that's right next to

1859
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:58,336
you is rather intense. You immediately suffer--
from proximity to its searing body-- 11 points of

1860
02:30:58,336 --> 02:30:59,449
fire damage.

1861
02:30:59,449 --> 02:31:00,686
LAURA: How much?

1862
02:31:00,686 --> 02:31:02,038
MARISHA: 11 points.

1863
02:31:02,038 --> 02:31:06,764
That's not bad, yeah.

1864
02:31:06,764 --> 02:31:09,122
LAURA: Are these monsters or beasts?

1865
02:31:09,122 --> 02:31:11,539
MATT: These are considered monstrosities.

1866
02:31:11,539 --> 02:31:14,757
TRAVIS: How tall is the area that we're standing
in?

1867
02:31:14,757 --> 02:31:20,796
MATT: The top of the cavern would be about, maybe,
ten feet. Ten to 12 feet.

1868
02:31:20,796 --> 02:31:33,117
TRAVIS: Ten to 12 feet? Yeah, I'm going to make
both of my attacks at Mama Bear. Yeah, because

1869
02:31:33,117 --> 02:31:37,673
I've got to move. Either I move and it senses the
non-stealthy-- yeah, fuck it, I'm just going to

1870
02:31:37,673 --> 02:31:55,347
take both of my Bloodaxe attacks at it with the
first one Great Weapon Master. Not reckless. 21?

1871
02:31:55,347 --> 02:31:57,195
MATT: 21 hits.

1872
02:31:57,195 --> 02:32:11,517
TRAVIS: Just barely? Okay. That's awesome. 26...
36 points of damage?

1873
02:32:11,517 --> 02:32:15,634
MATT: 36 points of damage on that first hit? Not
bad. The axe cracks into the side of its body, and

1874
02:32:15,634 --> 02:32:19,552
you see the armor crack a little bit where it
hits. You pull the axe free, you can see the blood

1875
02:32:19,552 --> 02:32:23,903
pour out. As it spills and hits the ground,
(sizzle) you can see the actual blood in their

1876
02:32:23,903 --> 02:32:26,576
body is superheated as well.

1877
02:32:26,576 --> 02:32:32,926
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a problem. Okay. They're like
xenomorphs. I'll take the second strike, as well.

1878
02:32:32,926 --> 02:32:35,594
Great Weapon Master, not reckless.

1879
02:32:35,594 --> 02:32:37,944
MATT: Okay, not reckless.

1880
02:32:37,944 --> 02:32:41,485
TRAVIS: That's shit. That's going to miss, I
think. Yeah. 20?

1881
02:32:41,485 --> 02:32:43,340
MATT: 20 hits.

1882
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:44,938
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

1883
02:32:44,938 --> 02:32:46,477
TALIESIN: We're learning, we're learning things.

1884
02:32:46,477 --> 02:32:47,528
TRAVIS: 15. Because I said Great Weapon Master,
it's minus five.

1885
02:32:47,528 --> 02:32:48,792
MATT: You did. That misses.

1886
02:32:48,792 --> 02:32:50,527
TALIESIN: Somewhere between 15 and 20.

1887
02:32:50,527 --> 02:32:54,052
MATT: This is this one time where you do swing and
it hits, but the angle of the axe blade hits the

1888
02:32:54,052 --> 02:32:59,634
edge of its head plate armor, and scrapes off the
top with a shower of sparks off to the side. No

1889
02:32:59,634 --> 02:33:01,018
damage.

1890
02:33:01,018 --> 02:33:04,166
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to rage or not?

1891
02:33:04,166 --> 02:33:08,436
MATT: Well, yeah, you were beginning to quietly
rage.

1892
02:33:08,436 --> 02:33:10,298
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Ends my turn.

1893
02:33:10,298 --> 02:33:11,552
LAURA: You want to move?

1894
02:33:11,552 --> 02:33:13,847
TRAVIS: No! I'm right next to it.

1895
02:33:13,847 --> 02:33:15,219
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

1896
02:33:15,219 --> 02:33:24,654
SAM: Boy, man. I don't know what these things can
do. I will step forward a little bit. Super

1897
02:33:24,654 --> 02:33:26,014
tanky.

1898
02:33:26,014 --> 02:33:27,561
MATT: Ten feet? Five feet?

1899
02:33:27,561 --> 02:33:31,007
SAM: That's good enough for now. No, keep going.

1900
02:33:31,007 --> 02:33:33,245
LAURA: There's lava! Careful!

1901
02:33:33,245 --> 02:33:44,794
SAM: Thanks. I will inspire Grog by singing the
customary birthday song of his people, which goes

1902
02:33:44,794 --> 02:33:53,840
like this, (singing) Happy happy happy, happy
happy happy-- they're a very simple people-- happy

1903
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:58,822
happy happy happy. (groans)

1904
02:33:58,822 --> 02:34:02,801
(laughter)

1905
02:34:02,801 --> 02:34:07,212
TRAVIS: You sang that better than my mother! Did I
have a mom?

1906
02:34:07,212 --> 02:34:17,201
SAM: And then as practice, I'm going to become my
beautiful angel self and transform into a naked

1907
02:34:17,201 --> 02:34:18,522
planetar.

1908
02:34:18,522 --> 02:34:22,389
MARISHA: Oh shit. Going planetar.

1909
02:34:22,389 --> 02:34:31,454
SAM: I assume I lose everything. I lose my Heroes'
Feast--

1910
02:34:31,454 --> 02:34:34,632
LAURA: Why would you?

1911
02:34:34,632 --> 02:34:36,087
SAM: Because I'm a different creature.

1912
02:34:36,087 --> 02:34:38,007
LAURA: So? It's still in your blood.

1913
02:34:38,007 --> 02:34:40,224
SAM: I don't think so.

1914
02:34:40,224 --> 02:34:41,968
MARISHA: Is this True Polymorph?

1915
02:34:41,968 --> 02:34:43,356
SAM: Yes.

1916
02:34:43,356 --> 02:34:44,597
TALIESIN: Maybe you get it back when you turn
back.

1917
02:34:44,597 --> 02:34:50,410
MARISHA: Generally, it'll say. Because
Shapechange, you absorb your armor.

1918
02:34:50,410 --> 02:34:54,831
SAM: Do you happen to have a planetar figurine?

1919
02:34:54,831 --> 02:34:56,493
MATT: That's what I'm checking. I thought I had one
prepared.

1920
02:34:56,493 --> 02:35:06,031
SAM: Oh my god. Guys. Magic: the Gathering
Puzzle Quest. Did I mention you can find out more

1921
02:35:06,031 --> 02:35:08,430
at bit.ly/MagicRole?

1922
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:10,004
LAURA: You did, actually!

1923
02:35:10,004 --> 02:35:15,818
SAM: Capital M, capital R on that, by the way,
guys. Visit it right now. Friends of the show.

1924
02:35:15,818 --> 02:35:17,392
They need your support.

1925
02:35:17,392 --> 02:35:18,458
LAURA: That's right.

1926
02:35:18,458 --> 02:35:22,670
MARISHA: You know those first generation Black
Lotus cards can go for $30,000, depending on their

1927
02:35:22,670 --> 02:35:24,123
condition.

1928
02:35:24,123 --> 02:35:26,115
TALIESIN: Is it the alpha style with the black
border?

1929
02:35:26,115 --> 02:35:28,212
MARISHA: Yep. Banned cards.

1930
02:35:28,212 --> 02:35:32,991
SAM: Matt is really looking for this thing. In the
meantime, let me tell you some other amazing

1931
02:35:32,991 --> 02:35:37,848
Magic: The Gathering cards. I've got Time Twister,
Jace the Mind Sculptor--

1932
02:35:37,848 --> 02:35:41,931
TALIESIN: I've actually performed the Jace the Mind
Sculptor. It takes three friends to really pull it

1933
02:35:41,931 --> 02:35:42,813
off.

1934
02:35:42,813 --> 02:35:46,597
SAM: Naked Singularity. Not a sexual position.

1935
02:35:46,597 --> 02:35:54,278
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, because
it is the same size as a large creature, right?

1936
02:35:54,278 --> 02:35:56,326
SAM: It is.

1937
02:35:56,326 --> 02:36:03,340
MATT: We will use good old Doty as the current
size of your planetar.

1938
02:36:03,340 --> 02:36:06,338
LIAM: I can touch my miniature! Whoa!

1939
02:36:06,338 --> 02:36:09,367
MATT: You need to be there, because otherwise
you'd be stepping in the lava.

1940
02:36:09,367 --> 02:36:10,900
SAM: Okay, thanks.

1941
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:12,305
MATT: So that's it?

1942
02:36:12,305 --> 02:36:13,827
SAM: I think that's all I can do.

1943
02:36:13,827 --> 02:36:15,695
MATT: You can continue to move, if you want.

1944
02:36:15,695 --> 02:36:20,620
SAM: Oh, that's interesting. As that guy, can I
move more?

1945
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:29,042
MATT: Well, you've moved maybe 15 feet. I'd say you
probably have, at his flying speed, maybe a third

1946
02:36:29,042 --> 02:36:30,642
of his fly speed left.

1947
02:36:30,642 --> 02:36:32,447
SAM: That's another 40 feet.

1948
02:36:32,447 --> 02:36:35,045
MATT: (chuckles) So there is that.

1949
02:36:35,045 --> 02:36:39,920
SAM: All right. Well, then you guys got this well
in hand. I'm going to fly to the other guy. Is he

1950
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:41,483
going to get an attack on me?

1951
02:36:41,483 --> 02:36:42,495
MATT: This guy here?

1952
02:36:42,495 --> 02:36:43,834
SAM: Yeah. As I fly up high?

1953
02:36:43,834 --> 02:36:46,507
MATT: You fly to him and you're gliding above
right now.

1954
02:36:46,507 --> 02:36:48,823
SAM: No, I'm going to go to the furthest guy.

1955
02:36:48,823 --> 02:36:53,728
MATT: Over here? (gliding noises) Okay. You're
currently floating above the lava. It's not

1956
02:36:53,728 --> 02:37:01,853
affecting you as you (whoosh) fly by. Because
you're flying, no, I will say the mom bulette

1957
02:37:01,853 --> 02:37:05,685
does not notice you pass. It does not get an
attack of opportunity.

1958
02:37:05,685 --> 02:37:07,875
SAM: (whispering) I'm the Crow.

1959
02:37:07,875 --> 02:37:11,509
MATT: Essentially. All right, that ends your turn.
Vax.

1960
02:37:11,509 --> 02:37:22,452
LIAM: Click the boots. Hunter's Mark on mama. So
all that's left is dagger, dagger, dagger, so I'm

1961
02:37:22,452 --> 02:37:26,015
going to do sharpshooter throws with the three
daggers that are left.

1962
02:37:26,015 --> 02:37:27,266
MATT: Okay.

1963
02:37:27,266 --> 02:37:34,180
LIAM: Am I within 60 feet? I think I am. All
right, so negative five on attacks. The first one

1964
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:41,346
is total shit. The second one is 17?

1965
02:37:41,346 --> 02:37:45,992
MATT: 17 does not hit. (dagger ricochets)
Ricochets off.

1966
02:37:45,992 --> 02:37:48,606
LIAM: 23 on the last.

1967
02:37:48,606 --> 02:37:49,591
MATT: That does hit.

1968
02:37:49,591 --> 02:38:01,222
LIAM: Okay, because Grog is right there, it is
sneak attack? (sighs) One, this is nine, plus that

1969
02:38:01,222 --> 02:38:13,774
is ten, plus this. 13, 18, 24, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37.
And because it was a sharpshooter attack, it's

1970
02:38:13,774 --> 02:38:15,022
47.

1971
02:38:15,022 --> 02:38:23,146
MATT: Oof. Nice. Great, so that one, seeing the
glow of the slight crack in the armor that Grog

1972
02:38:23,146 --> 02:38:28,506
had left, the dagger disappears
inside the slight gap, and you see this (spurt)

1973
02:38:28,506 --> 02:38:34,241
of super hot, thick, viscous blood spill
out and hit the side of the rock and then cool and

1974
02:38:34,241 --> 02:38:37,220
darken as it does across the side of the cavern
wall.

1975
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:46,430
LIAM: And then for movement, watch this shit right
here, folks. (counting) 40, because I'm hasted, 45,

1976
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:47,784
50, 55.

1977
02:38:47,784 --> 02:38:49,634
MATT: There you go.

1978
02:38:49,634 --> 02:38:51,105
SAM and LAURA: Wow.

1979
02:38:51,105 --> 02:38:52,942
LIAM: I did it my fucking self!

1980
02:38:52,942 --> 02:38:55,731
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

1981
02:38:55,731 --> 02:38:58,353
LAURA: Did it feel weird to have somebody else
moving the people?

1982
02:38:58,353 --> 02:39:01,977
MATT: No, it felt awesome. I didn't have to do a
damn thing. All right.

1983
02:39:01,977 --> 02:39:04,663
LIAM: Oh, and Hunter's Mark!

1984
02:39:04,663 --> 02:39:06,759
MATT: Yes, the Hunter's Mark damage.

1985
02:39:06,759 --> 02:39:07,842
LIAM: Six!

1986
02:39:07,842 --> 02:39:13,149
MATT: That's an additional six damage. All right,
infuriated, it's now starting to stomp in the

1987
02:39:13,149 --> 02:39:20,567
middle, and as it's hitting, the lava's starting
to splash up around it. The babies! This one right

1988
02:39:20,567 --> 02:39:26,186
here is only going to make a bite attack right
now. It can't make a leap because you're too close

1989
02:39:26,186 --> 02:39:31,979
to it. But as you rush towards it, it seems to
sense your presence, and the movement of the wings

1990
02:39:31,979 --> 02:39:38,456
(wing flap) keeping you aloft. And the baby's
going to (snapping) and lash out towards you. That

1991
02:39:38,456 --> 02:39:41,344
is 18.

1992
02:39:41,344 --> 02:39:42,995
SAM: Does not hit.

1993
02:39:42,995 --> 02:39:48,786
MATT: Does not hit. As it snaps out towards you,
its saliva seeming to spray superheated liquid

1994
02:39:48,786 --> 02:39:53,822
(saliva spray) across. Does not attack you at
all.

1995
02:39:53,822 --> 02:39:55,924
(laughter)

1996
02:39:55,924 --> 02:39:57,154
TALIESIN: Well that got GIF'ed.

1997
02:39:57,154 --> 02:39:58,871
LIAM: Dr. Manhattan, in the house!

1998
02:39:58,871 --> 02:40:10,369
MATT: The other baby watches you go running past.
It's going to go ahead and make a Deadly Leap. 15

1999
02:40:10,369 --> 02:40:13,736
(landing) on you. (whoosh) That brings it here.

2000
02:40:13,736 --> 02:40:15,374
LAURA: Oh shit!

2001
02:40:15,374 --> 02:40:17,482
LIAM: He's dead.

2002
02:40:17,482 --> 02:40:22,897
MATT: If that was the case, half you guys would've
been dead a long time ago. All right, I need you

2003
02:40:22,897 --> 02:40:25,935
to make a strength or dexterity saving throw, your
choice.

2004
02:40:25,935 --> 02:40:32,934
LIAM: I'll do dexterity at advantage because of
the boots, so that is a 27.

2005
02:40:32,934 --> 02:40:41,629
MATT: 27, okay. So you're not knocked prone, but
you do take-- let's see here. 19 points of damage,

2006
02:40:41,629 --> 02:40:50,898
bludgeoning and slashing. You are pushed five feet
out of its space.

2007
02:40:50,898 --> 02:40:52,750
LIAM: What was the total on that, Matt?

2008
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:53,803
LAURA: 19.

2009
02:40:53,803 --> 02:41:00,576
MATT: All righty. That's the two babies' turn.
Keyleth, you're up.

2010
02:41:00,576 --> 02:41:10,470
MARISHA: Okay. The battlefield changed a little
bit, so instead, can I do a Chain Lightning out of

2011
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:14,850
the staff and hit all three of those
motherfuckers? Starting with the big mama and

2012
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:17,075
branching off to the two other dudes?

2013
02:41:17,075 --> 02:41:18,650
MATT: I could say you could do that, yeah.

2014
02:41:18,650 --> 02:41:19,994
MARISHA: Yeah, I do that.

2015
02:41:19,994 --> 02:41:21,173
MATT: All righty.

2016
02:41:21,173 --> 02:41:32,071
MARISHA: That's 10d8. And it's a dex? I think it's
a dexterity saving throw, and it's 10d8. One, two,

2017
02:41:32,071 --> 02:41:36,521
three, four, five. Does anyone want to lend me
their d8s?

2018
02:41:36,521 --> 02:41:39,605
LAURA: How many? I've got five here.

2019
02:41:39,605 --> 02:41:45,478
MARISHA: You have five there? Okay, okay, okay. A
little Ashley Johnson "Okay, okay, okay."

2020
02:41:45,478 --> 02:41:49,004
LIAM and MARISHA: (imitating Ashley) Yeah!

2021
02:41:49,004 --> 02:41:55,047
MATT: Nope, nope, and nope. No one makes their
save. This big, hulking thing.

2022
02:41:55,047 --> 02:42:02,486
MARISHA: Okay, I get to reroll ones because I'm a
badass.

2023
02:42:02,486 --> 02:42:03,904
LIAM: You got a bunch, too.

2024
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:05,404
MARISHA: Yes, I did.

2025
02:42:05,404 --> 02:42:16,127
MARISHA: No, that's a ten. Ooh, that's good. Okay,
okay, five, four and four is eight, so that brings

2026
02:42:16,127 --> 02:42:19,967
us to 13, another-- wait, four and four and
eight--

2027
02:42:19,967 --> 02:42:21,451
LAURA: 17.

2028
02:42:21,451 --> 02:42:22,595
MARISHA: That was right, right?

2029
02:42:22,595 --> 02:42:24,436
LAURA: Yes, so you're at 17 now.

2030
02:42:24,436 --> 02:42:33,613
MARISHA: 17 plus another four is 21, plus another
five is 26, plus another four is 30, plus another

2031
02:42:33,613 --> 02:42:42,102
six is 36, plus another 16 total. So 36 plus 16 is
52.

2032
02:42:42,102 --> 02:42:44,560
MATT: 52 points of damage?

2033
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:46,768
LAURA: You've got another one here.

2034
02:42:46,768 --> 02:42:51,482
MARISHA: Oh, 52 plus another seven, so 59.

2035
02:42:51,482 --> 02:42:56,184
MATT: 59 damage against all three of them. So as
you stand in the middle and watch one of them leap

2036
02:42:56,184 --> 02:43:03,770
past and pounce onto your lover as he's pushed out
of the way, you see Grog now facing off with this

2037
02:43:03,770 --> 02:43:08,225
giant gnashing mouth that is spilling forth
super-hot liquid, the lava glowing in the

2038
02:43:08,225 --> 02:43:12,859
distance. You're having flashbacks to the last
time you dealt with lava. You concentrate for a

2039
02:43:12,859 --> 02:43:16,772
second and release the blast of energy as it arcs
off, (explosions) slamming into each of them. You

2040
02:43:16,772 --> 02:43:20,719
see them shake and quiver, their muscles tensing
as they shriek in the middle of the cavern.

2041
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:29,532
(shrieks) They stagger backward. Hurt, but
seemingly still holding on. All right, Percy, your

2042
02:43:29,532 --> 02:43:30,938
turn.

2043
02:43:30,938 --> 02:43:40,415
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate Silence. So that's
up. Charge Diplomacy. I'm going to give it a

2044
02:43:40,415 --> 02:43:46,803
little rev with my bonus action, and I'm going
to-- oh wow, can I actually reach? I can't quite

2045
02:43:46,803 --> 02:43:53,189
reach, but I can get close. I'm going to head
against that wall and start climbing up that

2046
02:43:53,189 --> 02:43:54,213
wall.

2047
02:43:54,213 --> 02:43:55,088
LAURA: Right here?

2048
02:43:55,088 --> 02:43:59,100
TALIESIN: Yeah, up there. Just put me up there.
Yeah, there we go.

2049
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:02,242
MATT: Okay. Is that all you're going to do with
your turn?

2050
02:44:02,242 --> 02:44:04,405
TALIESIN: That's my action, my bonus action, and
my movement.

2051
02:44:04,405 --> 02:44:12,828
MATT: All right, that's your turn. All right, now
it's the mama bulette's turn. Mama bulette has

2052
02:44:12,828 --> 02:44:16,249
been facing Grog this whole time, after taking the
dagger and watching you run past, seeming ready to

2053
02:44:16,249 --> 02:44:26,721
leap, but with you still right in front of it,
she'll attack you. That is a natural 18. This is

2054
02:44:26,721 --> 02:44:30,607
important. So that's a total of 31 to hit.

2055
02:44:30,607 --> 02:44:34,943
TRAVIS: Let me check-- yeah.

2056
02:44:34,943 --> 02:44:41,132
MATT: So that's 45 points of piercing damage,
halved. We'll say 22, plus 13 points of fire

2057
02:44:41,132 --> 02:44:52,211
damage... and you are swallowed. On an attack roll
of an 18 to 20, it swallows the target. And

2058
02:44:52,211 --> 02:44:54,151
literally, I rolled a natural 18.

2059
02:44:54,151 --> 02:44:56,032
TALIESIN: What happens if you--

2060
02:44:56,032 --> 02:44:59,354
TRAVIS: It's always me! (laughing) It's always
me.

2061
02:44:59,354 --> 02:45:01,171
MATT: Apparently, man.

2062
02:45:01,171 --> 02:45:05,690
TALIESIN: What happens if you Titanstone-- never
mind. I'm going to find out.

2063
02:45:05,690 --> 02:45:08,523
TRAVIS: We've done this before. I'm well-versed.

2064
02:45:08,523 --> 02:45:10,502
MATT: You are blinded and restrained, currently.

2065
02:45:10,502 --> 02:45:12,580
TRAVIS: Blinded and restrained.

2066
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:30,871
MATT: It now begins to (thudding) go right up into
melee range with Keyleth, who blasted it with the

2067
02:45:30,871 --> 02:45:35,696
Chain Lightning before. That brings us to the top
of the round. Vex, you're up.

2068
02:45:35,696 --> 02:45:43,164
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark it! And
then I'm going to attack it with an arrow.

2069
02:45:43,164 --> 02:45:44,697
MATT: Go for it.

2070
02:45:44,697 --> 02:45:47,954
LAURA: (old woman voice) Bramble Shot!

2071
02:45:47,954 --> 02:45:49,901
MATT: How'd that go again?

2072
02:45:49,901 --> 02:45:56,595
LAURA: (old woman voice) Bramble Shot! (normal
voice) 25! Oh! Can I do sharpshooter and do minus

2073
02:45:56,595 --> 02:45:58,232
five to hit, plus ten to attack?

2074
02:45:58,232 --> 02:46:02,819
MATT: Generally, you have to decide that before
you roll your attack. You can't just add it on

2075
02:46:02,819 --> 02:46:07,439
like, oh, I rolled well! I'll say no, not for that
first attack. You can for your second.

2076
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:10,615
LAURA: This one is a Bramble Shot and it's a 25 to
hit.

2077
02:46:10,615 --> 02:46:12,745
MATT: That does hit.

2078
02:46:12,745 --> 02:46:25,942
LAURA: Okay, cool. Five plus eight is 13, 14, 15. 15
plus sneak attack and lightning damage. 15, 19,

2079
02:46:25,942 --> 02:46:39,221
23, 25, and then 4d8 piercing damage. 32.

2080
02:46:39,221 --> 02:46:42,673
MATT: All right. 32 points.

2081
02:46:42,673 --> 02:46:44,698
LAURA: And then he has to make a strength saving
throw.

2082
02:46:44,698 --> 02:46:47,170
MATT: That is a 20.

2083
02:46:47,170 --> 02:46:48,747
LAURA: Then he succeeds.

2084
02:46:48,747 --> 02:46:54,106
MATT: As the arrow slams into the side, the
brambles reach around, and you watch as these

2085
02:46:54,106 --> 02:47:00,876
thorny vines that wrap around the body begin to blacken
and burst into flame. By the proximity, the

2086
02:47:00,876 --> 02:47:04,998
brambles begin to burn to cinders and then break
off the body as it storms forward.

2087
02:47:04,998 --> 02:47:11,810
LAURA: I attack him again. This time I'm going to
try as a sharpshooter!

2088
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:12,932
MATT: Do it!

2089
02:47:12,932 --> 02:47:14,130
LAURA: Okay!

2090
02:47:14,130 --> 02:47:15,772
MATT: You're up next, Grog.

2091
02:47:15,772 --> 02:47:18,330
LAURA: Natural 20!

2092
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:21,359
MATT: Holy shit! That'll hit.

2093
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,500
LAURA: And it's a Bramble Shot. Do I have to say
that before, too? Motherfucker.

2094
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:31,294
MATT: Well, Bramble Shot gets to see if it hits or
not. It's not lost if you missed. If you hit, you

2095
02:47:31,294 --> 02:47:32,409
can say Bramble Shot.

2096
02:47:32,409 --> 02:47:33,292
LAURA: So yeah!

2097
02:47:33,292 --> 02:47:35,241
MATT: Same way that Divine Smite can be done.

2098
02:47:35,241 --> 02:47:45,282
LAURA: Okay, cool! All right! Right. I'm going to
roll all my dice, and then double that, then add

2099
02:47:45,282 --> 02:47:46,948
my extra things. How about that?

2100
02:47:46,948 --> 02:47:49,401
MATT: Do that. That's usually how you're supposed
to do it.

2101
02:47:49,401 --> 02:48:03,548
LAURA: All right, Matt. Okay, so 11, 14, 20, 23,
25, 50. That's easy. 58, 60.

2102
02:48:03,548 --> 02:48:07,436
MATT: 60 points of damage with one shot! And
secondary saving throw.

2103
02:48:07,436 --> 02:48:11,039
LAURA: Oh, plus ten because it was sharpshooter.
70!

2104
02:48:11,039 --> 02:48:14,917
MATT: 70 points of damage with a single arrow! You
didn't add your sneak attack damage a second time,

2105
02:48:14,917 --> 02:48:21,682
did you? Okay, good. That is nasty. It rolled a
natural 16 plus six for its strength saving throw,

2106
02:48:21,682 --> 02:48:25,666
so it's not affected by the bramble. However, it
is looking <i>rough</i>. The second arrow hits the side

2107
02:48:25,666 --> 02:48:30,720
and you watch as it streaks, pieces of the armor
fall off to the side. You can see the striations of

2108
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:35,415
its muscle, and where the muscle tissue is, it's
dark, but at the seams it's glowing orange.

2109
02:48:35,415 --> 02:48:39,096
LAURA: I didn't add the Hunter's Mark damage.
Well, only extra two damage for that.

2110
02:48:39,096 --> 02:48:44,652
MATT: There you go, extra two damage. But now it's
bleeding everywhere. Wherever it's walking, you

2111
02:48:44,652 --> 02:48:49,531
can see it thrashing about. It's spilling off this
heated liquid that's pouring out of its wounds.

2112
02:48:49,531 --> 02:48:51,374
Does that end your turn?

2113
02:48:51,374 --> 02:48:58,777
LAURA: No, I'm going to move on my broom so he
doesn't know I'm there. I'm going to fly to here.

2114
02:48:58,777 --> 02:49:04,557
MATT: Okay! That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
First things first, at the start of your turn,

2115
02:49:04,557 --> 02:49:15,972
because you are swallowed by the mom, you suffer
42 points of fire damage. Oh, it has to make a

2116
02:49:15,972 --> 02:49:18,715
constitution saving throw to see if it spits him
up first, actually, because you did more than 40

2117
02:49:18,715 --> 02:49:28,710
points of damage. That is a 22. Yeah, it's fine.
Wait, no, it's 25 DC. No, it does not! You do not

2118
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:34,994
take the damage because she did enough damage with
that crit hit arrow that it vomits you up. You are

2119
02:49:34,994 --> 02:49:36,086
prone.

2120
02:49:36,086 --> 02:49:37,238
LAURA: Happy birthday!

2121
02:49:37,238 --> 02:49:38,601
TRAVIS: Thank you!

2122
02:49:38,601 --> 02:49:44,133
MATT: That would have been a good 42 points of
damage.

2123
02:49:44,133 --> 02:49:46,734
MARISHA: Grog gets vomited up in front of me?

2124
02:49:46,734 --> 02:49:51,548
MATT: Yep! (sizzling) There's steam.

2125
02:49:51,548 --> 02:49:53,598
TRAVIS: Every fucking time. Hi!

2126
02:49:53,598 --> 02:49:55,557
MARISHA: You smell like shit.

2127
02:49:55,557 --> 02:49:59,018
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

2128
02:49:59,018 --> 02:50:00,731
TRAVIS: I'd like to stand up.

2129
02:50:00,731 --> 02:50:02,190
MATT: All right.

2130
02:50:02,190 --> 02:50:04,308
SAM: Jump into its throat.

2131
02:50:04,308 --> 02:50:05,872
TALIESIN: Jump back in.

2132
02:50:05,872 --> 02:50:19,462
TRAVIS: I would like to smash my Titanstone
Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself.

2133
02:50:19,462 --> 02:50:22,491
Gotta get some fire resistance because good god.

2134
02:50:22,491 --> 02:50:26,954
MARISHA: Big Grog!

2135
02:50:26,954 --> 02:50:29,825
LAURA: Whoa, what is that?

2136
02:50:29,825 --> 02:50:31,262
MARISHA: He's swole.

2137
02:50:31,262 --> 02:50:33,191
LAURA: I don't think we've seen this.

2138
02:50:33,191 --> 02:50:34,584
MATT: That's been it every time.

2139
02:50:34,584 --> 02:50:35,719
TRAVIS: Yeah, every time.

2140
02:50:35,719 --> 02:50:41,748
LAURA: But we haven't seen it! Haven't seen it up
close. Oh, Grog is scary as fuck! I'm sorry;

2141
02:50:41,748 --> 02:50:44,037
you're scary! Okay.

2142
02:50:44,037 --> 02:50:46,594
TRAVIS: Can I do reckless, Great Weapon Master?

2143
02:50:46,594 --> 02:50:47,463
MATT: Yes, you may.

2144
02:50:47,463 --> 02:50:49,133
TALIESIN: That's something Travis would say.

2145
02:50:49,133 --> 02:50:51,113
LAURA: Put me down?

2146
02:50:51,113 --> 02:50:53,138
TALIESIN: It's something Travis would say.

2147
02:50:53,138 --> 02:50:56,213
TRAVIS: 26?

2148
02:50:56,213 --> 02:50:57,684
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2149
02:50:57,684 --> 02:51:04,848
TRAVIS: Nice. 37 on the first.

2150
02:51:04,848 --> 02:51:06,400
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2151
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:08,101
(cheering)

2152
02:51:08,101 --> 02:51:14,200
TRAVIS: (singing) Happy happy (war cry).

2153
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:16,456
TALIESIN: Happy birthday.

2154
02:51:16,456 --> 02:51:20,535
MATT: After it finishes vomiting you up and you
get off the ground, still feeling the sizzling of

2155
02:51:20,535 --> 02:51:25,735
its salivary liquid on your body, you sing this
song to yourself as it rights itself. Its mouth

2156
02:51:25,735 --> 02:51:30,344
opens once more. You bring the axe down right above
its head. You crack the center of its armored

2157
02:51:30,344 --> 02:51:36,368
plate. The top of its head caves in and you watch as
the eyes go dull and the body collapses and falls

2158
02:51:36,368 --> 02:51:41,093
to the ground, unmoving. Its body is still there,
though, because it's very big. It only loses about

2159
02:51:41,093 --> 02:51:45,870
two feet of height as it collapses, and it's still
blocking a large portion of that hallway right

2160
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:52,062
now. That's your first hit. You still have half
of your movement, still, because you used half of

2161
02:51:52,062 --> 02:51:53,787
it to get up from prone.

2162
02:51:53,826 --> 02:51:56,059
TRAVIS: Should I try and push him out of the way?

2163
02:51:56,059 --> 02:52:00,265
LAURA: Just vault over it.

2164
02:52:00,265 --> 02:52:07,739
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm going to (leaping noise) over the
side, hardcore parkour. One-handed.

2165
02:52:07,739 --> 02:52:12,413
SAM: Duke boys, sliding over the hood of the car?

2166
02:52:12,413 --> 02:52:15,511
MATT: Using your boots, or just making an athletics
check as part of your movement?

2167
02:52:15,511 --> 02:52:18,484
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's use the Boots of Feral
Leaping.

2168
02:52:18,484 --> 02:52:20,483
MATT: Go ahead and make your athletics check.

2169
02:52:20,483 --> 02:52:36,358
TRAVIS: That's going to be a 26. 27. Towards you.
Towards his left. Yep. And I'll move up.

2170
02:52:36,358 --> 02:52:37,907
MATT: You have 25 more feet.

2171
02:52:37,907 --> 02:52:39,130
TRAVIS: I do, don't I?

2172
02:52:39,130 --> 02:52:41,724
MATT: You can use your piece. Look at that!

2173
02:52:41,724 --> 02:52:45,187
TRAVIS: Can I get around here on the ground?

2174
02:52:45,187 --> 02:52:51,658
MATT: Yeah, you could. You can make an acrobatics
check to see if you can avoid the lava as you do

2175
02:52:51,658 --> 02:52:52,801
that.

2176
02:52:52,801 --> 02:52:54,571
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to!

2177
02:52:54,571 --> 02:52:57,006
MATT: All right, make an acrobatics, not athletics.

2178
02:52:57,006 --> 02:52:59,100
TRAVIS: Acrobatics. 16.

2179
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:06,717
MATT: 16? You just barely make it around that
corner, curling around. Yeah, you don't go

2180
02:53:06,717 --> 02:53:10,738
foot-first in the lava, like somebody else did
earlier.

2181
02:53:10,738 --> 02:53:16,392
MARISHA: I'm picturing Grog being like (intense
grunting, careful inching, intense grunting).

2182
02:53:16,392 --> 02:53:18,503
MATT: That's about where you can get to.

2183
02:53:18,503 --> 02:53:21,071
TRAVIS: I'm right there, yeah.

2184
02:53:21,071 --> 02:53:23,105
MATT: That's the end of your turn, Grog. Scanlan,
you're up.

2185
02:53:23,105 --> 02:53:32,625
SAM: As my holy self, imbued with the holy power
of whatever I am, I float up a bit, draw my

2186
02:53:32,625 --> 02:53:39,506
greatsword that I always use to attack because I'm
awesome and bring it down real hard on the head of

2187
02:53:39,506 --> 02:53:40,635
the thing.

2188
02:53:40,635 --> 02:53:42,711
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

2189
02:53:42,711 --> 02:53:46,561
LAURA: Are you naked with a sword hanging from
your hip?

2190
02:53:46,561 --> 02:53:48,314
LIAM: He's hitting it with his dick.

2191
02:53:48,314 --> 02:53:52,915
SAM: No, I'm naked with a sword. I've got a belt.
I'm naked with a belt.

2192
02:53:52,915 --> 02:53:55,633
MARISHA: He's Mr. November.

2193
02:53:55,633 --> 02:53:59,094
SAM: That is 21.

2194
02:53:59,094 --> 02:54:06,147
MATT: 21 hits. The babies don't have quite as hard
armor. As you bring the greatsword down, you

2195
02:54:06,147 --> 02:54:11,386
strike with a large swipe of bright, divine
radiant energy. As it slams into the top of its

2196
02:54:11,386 --> 02:54:13,835
head, it explodes with radiant power.

2197
02:54:13,835 --> 02:54:16,128
SAM: Do I roll, or do I use these stats?

2198
02:54:16,128 --> 02:54:20,718
MATT: You roll damage. The stats are for me. 4d6
plus seven slashing.

2199
02:54:20,718 --> 02:54:30,110
SAM: Seven, 12, 18 plus seven is 25. Plus I need
5d8.

2200
02:54:30,110 --> 02:54:34,321
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Use mine! They just did very
good.

2201
02:54:34,321 --> 02:54:37,830
MATT: Yeah, dude. Planetar form isn't messing
around.

2202
02:54:37,830 --> 02:54:46,676
LAURA: He didn't shake them, you just put
them on down. That was the shadiest roll ever. If

2203
02:54:46,676 --> 02:54:49,318
you did that in Vegas, they'd be like, "No."

2204
02:54:49,318 --> 02:54:51,561
TRAVIS: The pit boss over here disapproves.

2205
02:54:51,561 --> 02:54:54,598
SAM: Plus 14. So that's 39, right?

2206
02:54:54,598 --> 02:54:56,117
MATT: 39, yes.

2207
02:54:56,117 --> 02:54:57,493
SAM: On my first attack.

2208
02:54:57,493 --> 02:55:03,134
MATT: So first off, I forgot earlier. Grog, you
did take another seven points of fire damage from

2209
02:55:03,134 --> 02:55:05,970
being in the proximity of the corpse, which is still
emanating heat, by the way.

2210
02:55:05,970 --> 02:55:09,463
TRAVIS: Halved, because I have resistance from the
enlargement now.

2211
02:55:09,463 --> 02:55:13,383
MATT: Correct. Well, at the top of your turn, you
got that, because you did not enlarge inside. And

2212
02:55:13,383 --> 02:55:17,422
you also, as your planetar form, did take ten
points of fire damage in your proximity to that

2213
02:55:17,422 --> 02:55:22,990
one there, as well, so mark that. However, you,
with that first strike, slam down and cleave the

2214
02:55:22,990 --> 02:55:28,086
head in half. You watch as the baby's head
(gravelly shriek). It had taken 49 damage before

2215
02:55:28,086 --> 02:55:34,112
from her Chain Lightning. So with that second hit,
(whack) it (gurgles) and falls to the ground, no

2216
02:55:34,112 --> 02:55:37,925
longer moving. There is only one currently living
child on the battlefield.

2217
02:55:37,925 --> 02:55:44,211
SAM: All right. Well, then I'll say a silent
prayer for the fallen and then fly backwards super

2218
02:55:44,211 --> 02:55:48,622
fast to the other one (whoosh) and attack again!

2219
02:55:48,622 --> 02:55:51,284
LAURA: Maybe you can make it a pet.

2220
02:55:51,284 --> 02:55:55,958
SAM: Oh. 18.

2221
02:55:55,958 --> 02:55:57,335
MATT: 18 still hits.

2222
02:55:57,335 --> 02:56:10,306
SAM: Hey! All right. Look at all these crazy
things. 12 plus-- that's not very good. 12 plus

2223
02:56:10,306 --> 02:56:12,028
all those.

2224
02:56:12,028 --> 02:56:13,293
MATT: That was 12 plus seven?

2225
02:56:13,293 --> 02:56:14,496
SAM: That's right. 19.

2226
02:56:14,496 --> 02:56:15,827
MATT: So 19 damage.

2227
02:56:15,827 --> 02:56:21,181
SAM: (counting) 19. Whatever I just said. Is that
19 plus 19?

2228
02:56:21,181 --> 02:56:22,319
MATT: 19 plus 19.

2229
02:56:22,319 --> 02:56:23,826
SAM: 34?

2230
02:56:23,826 --> 02:56:33,567
MATT: 38 damage. That kills it, yeah. So you hack
one down, dart across the way with your blade

2231
02:56:33,567 --> 02:56:38,013
screaming in the air. It actually cuts through the
rock as it sparks across the ceiling. With what

2232
02:56:38,013 --> 02:56:42,942
little space you have, your wings open, slam down
on the second child and watch as its armored body

2233
02:56:42,942 --> 02:56:48,311
cracks open. The radiant blast expands and bursts
when the blade is actually dug a few inches into

2234
02:56:48,311 --> 02:56:52,845
its form, causing you to destroy it from the
inside of its armored shell. You watch as its body

2235
02:56:52,845 --> 02:57:04,675
inflates for a second, then falls limp as smoke
begins to pour from its wounds. So with that, you

2236
02:57:04,675 --> 02:57:08,370
guys have wiped out the current danger on the
battlefield.

2237
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:12,335
SAM: I feel like there's more coming.

2238
02:57:12,335 --> 02:57:15,141
LAURA: No, that was it.

2239
02:57:15,141 --> 02:57:17,441
TRAVIS: We're just traumatized.

2240
02:57:17,441 --> 02:57:25,796
LAURA: The Core Anvil is going to float up
from the magma.

2241
02:57:25,857 --> 02:57:27,865
MARISHA: It's so hot.

2242
02:57:27,865 --> 02:57:31,155
TALIESIN: That's a complicated tray.

2243
02:57:31,155 --> 02:57:35,040
(laughter)

2244
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:39,086
TRAVIS: As he herniates a disc.

2245
02:57:39,086 --> 02:57:46,159
MATT: Yeah. I pulled my leg earlier this week, so
moving up and down sucks. So as you sit there in

2246
02:57:46,159 --> 02:57:51,594
the silence there for a moment, just hearing the
occasional (plopping) with the nearby lava that

2247
02:57:51,594 --> 02:57:59,599
fills the nearby hallway, you don't feel any
further rumbling. There's just the heat emanating

2248
02:57:59,599 --> 02:58:05,267
from the corpses of these three magma bullettes.
What do you do?

2249
02:58:05,267 --> 02:58:10,123
TRAVIS: Can I look around for anything that
resembles an anvil or a shelf or something that

2250
02:58:10,123 --> 02:58:12,564
one might wackadoodle on?

2251
02:58:12,564 --> 02:58:14,191
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2252
02:58:14,191 --> 02:58:16,224
TRAVIS: Nice. Watch me knock this out of the
park.

2253
02:58:16,224 --> 02:58:19,812
MATT: I'd say more of a perception check for
this. This is less of searching for details.

2254
02:58:19,812 --> 02:58:22,204
TRAVIS: That's better. Still shitty. 11.

2255
02:58:22,204 --> 02:58:26,454
MATT: The pathway still continues to descend and
curve around, but that's it.

2256
02:58:26,454 --> 02:58:29,567
TRAVIS: The pathway still continues to descend
around.

2257
02:58:29,567 --> 02:58:33,104
LAURA: Wow. Very observant of you, Grog.

2258
02:58:33,104 --> 02:58:35,123
MARISHA: Descended around.

2259
02:58:35,123 --> 02:58:36,134
TRAVIS: What?

2260
02:58:36,134 --> 02:58:37,354
MARISHA: Copy that.

2261
02:58:37,354 --> 02:58:42,623
LAURA: Can we see now because of all the glow
coming from-- does magma glow?

2262
02:58:42,623 --> 02:58:51,003
MATT: Most of you, aside from Percival, can see
decently in low light, anyway, or have

2263
02:58:51,003 --> 02:58:52,301
darkvision.

2264
02:58:52,301 --> 02:58:55,975
TALIESIN: It's only been about 25 seconds, but we
do eventually have to breathe.

2265
02:58:55,975 --> 02:58:58,520
LAURA: Oh. I'll use my chalice.

2266
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:00,854
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Pass the jug.

2267
02:59:00,854 --> 02:59:02,462
SAM: What about me?

2268
02:59:02,462 --> 02:59:07,913
MATT: You, as a planetar, let's see here.

2269
02:59:07,913 --> 02:59:09,580
SAM: I think I'm dying.

2270
02:59:09,580 --> 02:59:11,564
LAURA: What? Why?

2271
02:59:11,564 --> 02:59:13,416
SAM: I don't know. I think I probably need air.

2272
02:59:13,416 --> 02:59:22,369
MATT: Well, you have a pretty high con bonus. You
could hold your breath for seven minutes.

2273
02:59:22,369 --> 02:59:25,449
SAM: I'll do that. See how I fare.

2274
02:59:25,449 --> 02:59:27,265
LAURA: Do you still have Heroes' Feast?

2275
02:59:27,265 --> 02:59:28,374
SAM: No.

2276
02:59:28,374 --> 02:59:29,470
MARISHA: No, you do.

2277
02:59:29,470 --> 02:59:32,501
SAM: I don't think I do. I'm a new body.

2278
02:59:32,501 --> 02:59:39,553
MARISHA: No. True Polymorph, you absorb your gear
and you don't benefit from it, but it doesn't say

2279
02:59:39,553 --> 02:59:41,819
anything about you not benefiting from--

2280
02:59:41,819 --> 02:59:45,063
MATT: Previous spells and bonuses. That's an
interesting point.

2281
02:59:45,063 --> 02:59:49,600
TALIESIN: The soul is imbued with Heroes' Feast,
not the body.

2282
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:50,630
MARISHA: Correct.

2283
02:59:50,630 --> 02:59:52,084
MATT: Okay.

2284
02:59:52,084 --> 02:59:53,744
SAM: Interesting.

2285
02:59:53,744 --> 02:59:56,014
TALIESIN: See, it's all there.

2286
02:59:56,014 --> 02:59:58,441
(laughter)

2287
02:59:58,441 --> 03:00:00,562
LIAM: But we're along the path to the water that I
saw.

2288
03:00:00,562 --> 03:00:04,288
MARISHA: The gear melds into the new form. The
creature cannot activate, use, wield, or otherwise

2289
03:00:04,288 --> 03:00:09,403
benefit from any of its equipment, but it doesn't
say anything else other than equipment.

2290
03:00:09,403 --> 03:00:11,367
SAM: Thank you, Lindsay Lohan.

2291
03:00:11,367 --> 03:00:14,402
MARISHA: You're very welcome.

2292
03:00:14,402 --> 03:00:17,104
MATT: I'll allow it.

2293
03:00:17,104 --> 03:00:18,994
SAM: I still can't breathe.

2294
03:00:18,994 --> 03:00:23,151
MATT: You still have the same effect earlier that
she put on you, so you still have the water

2295
03:00:23,151 --> 03:00:24,000
breathing.

2296
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,389
SAM: Oh! So I can breathe some water. All right,
cool.

2297
03:00:26,389 --> 03:00:33,443
MATT: You're flying in here with the small space
you have. Being a large creature, the fact that

2298
03:00:33,443 --> 03:00:38,204
you even flew across-- you were only a few inches
off the ground as you darted over. It's only about

2299
03:00:38,204 --> 03:00:42,096
ten to 12 feet, and you're maybe nine feet tall.

2300
03:00:42,096 --> 03:00:45,748
LAURA: You're 12 feet tall, so you're hitting the
ceiling?

2301
03:00:45,748 --> 03:00:48,893
TALIESIN: I'm going to start peering around the
corner with the flashlight.

2302
03:00:48,893 --> 03:00:52,795
LIAM: We're under two minutes away from the water
I previously made it up to and didn't go into,

2303
03:00:52,795 --> 03:00:53,779
correct?

2304
03:00:53,779 --> 03:00:56,024
MATT: Correct. You're maybe 40 seconds away from
it.

2305
03:00:56,024 --> 03:00:57,666
TALIESIN: I'm going to head that way.

2306
03:00:57,666 --> 03:01:03,132
MATT: You guys dart around the corner and follow
the next pool. You have your means of passing

2307
03:01:03,132 --> 03:01:09,070
water around, keeping yourselves viable. The path
continues to curve in a haphazard spiral. It

2308
03:01:09,079 --> 03:01:16,908
curves around and you watch as it passes, evens
out, and then goes into a fairly steep decline,

2309
03:01:16,908 --> 03:01:20,484
a 45-degree decline.

2310
03:01:20,484 --> 03:01:24,508
LAURA: Should I try flying down there with the
broom?

2311
03:01:24,508 --> 03:01:30,324
LIAM: We're 30 seconds away from the water. I've 
already gone this way and come back to you guys. Unless

2312
03:01:30,324 --> 03:01:35,128
something has jumped in the hole while I was gone
in that time, I've already covered this ground.

2313
03:01:35,128 --> 03:01:41,149
MATT: This is further than you covered. There's
the pool of water you saw, and if you continue

2314
03:01:41,190 --> 03:01:45,399
around that way, you can see it curve as you
glance around and it descends in a steady

2315
03:01:45,399 --> 03:01:46,247
decline.

2316
03:01:46,247 --> 03:01:47,883
TALIESIN: The pool of water is just a pool of
water.

2317
03:01:47,883 --> 03:01:50,272
MATT: It's a small, little pit.

2318
03:01:50,272 --> 03:01:54,245
LAURA: I'm going to recast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us, P.S.

2319
03:01:54,245 --> 03:02:00,907
TALIESIN: I can follow you down there, too,
because I've got my boots on.

2320
03:02:00,907 --> 03:02:03,354
MARISHA: Do the two twins want to scout?

2321
03:02:03,354 --> 03:02:07,282
MATT: The pool of water, by the way, as you glance
down and look past the surface, it does have a

2322
03:02:07,282 --> 03:02:12,833
cylindrical tube that is feeding the liquid into
it, but it's much smaller. It gets to that big of

2323
03:02:12,833 --> 03:02:15,078
a pinching point before it vanishes out of sight.

2324
03:02:15,078 --> 03:02:16,472
LIAM: Of your hands?

2325
03:02:16,472 --> 03:02:20,276
MATT: Of the pool. Continuing down the path of the
tunnel, as it curves around and goes into the

2326
03:02:20,276 --> 03:02:30,643
decline, it continues and maintains its width of
about 15 to 20 feet on either side. You glance

2327
03:02:30,643 --> 03:02:37,838
down the decline, and there's a portion of the
ground that opens up and glowing molten rock

2328
03:02:37,838 --> 03:02:42,199
slowly drips and dribbles down for about 40 or 50
feet.

2329
03:02:42,199 --> 03:02:54,307
SAM: I'm going to cast Detect Evil and then
wordlessly speak to you all.

2330
03:02:54,307 --> 03:02:56,527
LAURA: Oh, in our brains? I like it.

2331
03:02:56,527 --> 03:03:09,247
SAM: I say: Brothers and sisters. Allow me to
guide us by the spirits of my religious faith down

2332
03:03:09,247 --> 03:03:12,366
into the depths of this hell place.

2333
03:03:12,366 --> 03:03:16,146
LIAM: While he's talking, I turn to my sister and
go--

2334
03:03:16,146 --> 03:03:19,388
LAURA: Are you still you, Scanlan, just in another
body?

2335
03:03:19,388 --> 03:03:22,912
SAM: Yes, my child. Inside.

2336
03:03:22,912 --> 03:03:24,744
TRAVIS: Boners and wangs.

2337
03:03:24,744 --> 03:03:32,095
LAURA: It's weird that you're nine feet tall, but
your penis is still a cube.

2338
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:34,401
SAM: That's by choice.

2339
03:03:34,401 --> 03:03:37,343
(laughter)

2340
03:03:37,343 --> 03:03:46,377
SAM: So you can recognize me if I die in a fight
and you have to go to a lab and identify the body,

2341
03:03:46,377 --> 03:03:51,532
you'll be like (fake crying) oh, it's him!

2342
03:03:51,532 --> 03:03:54,642
LIAM: And they shall know him by his cube.

2343
03:03:54,642 --> 03:03:58,251
LAURA: Sorry. Yes. Lead the way.

2344
03:03:58,251 --> 03:04:10,092
MATT: You glide down your own way. The air is
extremely warm as it passes by you. Holding your

2345
03:04:10,092 --> 03:04:14,182
breath at this point, because you are not near any
source of water, it looks like, and you're not

2346
03:04:14,182 --> 03:04:19,534
carrying one with you. You glide down, rapid speed
past the lava, which eventually comes and cools in

2347
03:04:19,534 --> 03:04:26,887
a clump, a small mound where it seems a recent
hole punched out of and began to dribble down.

2348
03:04:26,887 --> 03:04:31,063
It's been cooling and causing this extra layer on
the tunnel. Everything here seems to be in this weird

2349
03:04:31,063 --> 03:04:41,327
state of flux. You continue past it, and it drops
into a tunnel below, maybe about 20 or 30 feet

2350
03:04:41,327 --> 03:04:43,514
wide. Descends downward.

2351
03:04:43,514 --> 03:04:44,389
SAM: Straight down?

2352
03:04:44,389 --> 03:04:45,410
MATT: Straight down.

2353
03:04:45,410 --> 03:04:46,617
SAM: I'll go down a bit.

2354
03:04:46,617 --> 03:04:56,098
MATT: You descend about 30 or 40 feet. This
cylinder-like tunnel comes to a halt; it stops.

2355
03:04:56,098 --> 03:04:58,082
SAM: Am I detecting any evil?

2356
03:04:58,082 --> 03:05:01,291
MATT: You are not detecting any evil, no. Do you
have darkvision in this form?

2357
03:05:01,291 --> 03:05:05,024
SAM: I don't know! Where does it say?

2358
03:05:05,024 --> 03:05:09,949
MATT: It says truesight. You don't have
darkvision; you have <i>everything</i> vision.

2359
03:05:09,949 --> 03:05:11,534
TALIESIN: Predator vision.

2360
03:05:11,534 --> 03:05:13,812
SAM: I can also speak every language!

2361
03:05:13,812 --> 03:05:20,866
MATT: Given that case, as soon as you land, you
look up and you can see across the rock here,

2362
03:05:20,866 --> 03:05:30,638
there is one portion of the wall that is smoother
than the rest in a concave perfect square across

2363
03:05:30,638 --> 03:05:39,457
the opposite side. You can see faint runes or
glyphs that are pressed into the stone, like part

2364
03:05:39,457 --> 03:05:42,804
of it has been untouched for quite some time.

2365
03:05:42,804 --> 03:05:48,374
SAM: Is there writing or is it just symbols?

2366
03:05:48,374 --> 03:05:51,334
MATT: Because you can read any language, right?

2367
03:05:51,334 --> 03:05:54,943
SAM: It says languages: all.

2368
03:05:54,943 --> 03:05:56,439
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

2369
03:05:56,439 --> 03:06:01,081
TALIESIN: This is the most irritated I've ever seen
Matt.

2370
03:06:01,081 --> 03:06:06,592
LIAM: This is because of the planetar, not Ioun?
Planetar. This is how you must stay always.

2371
03:06:06,592 --> 03:06:08,140
SAM: I agree.

2372
03:06:08,140 --> 03:06:21,174
MATT: Glancing at the glyphs here, there are roots
of magical, arcane glyphs here, but whatever

2373
03:06:21,174 --> 03:06:25,194
enchantment there was here is very faint. It's
more about the message or image that is set here.

2374
03:06:25,194 --> 03:06:36,215
It is an exit seal. It is a final word of those
that utilized the space within. It translates to,

2375
03:06:36,215 --> 03:06:49,712
"Here the Crafter's Halls lay dark, the means of
making the World Ender gone. Allhammer protect us all."

2376
03:06:49,712 --> 03:06:53,766
SAM: Allhammer. Wow. I don't know.

2377
03:06:53,766 --> 03:06:56,779
MATT: The Allhammer. Make a religion check.

2378
03:06:56,779 --> 03:06:58,298
LAURA: The Allhammer was--

2379
03:06:58,298 --> 03:06:59,713
TRAVIS: You're not there.

2380
03:06:59,713 --> 03:07:10,881
SAM: Looking. Religion. I don't know. 11 plus I
don't know.

2381
03:07:10,881 --> 03:07:20,113
MATT: Recalling that information, you have this
information in your mind, I'll say. As long as you

2382
03:07:20,113 --> 03:07:21,504
didn't roll a one.

2383
03:07:21,504 --> 03:07:23,339
LIAM: You don't remember it, but you remember it.

2384
03:07:23,339 --> 03:07:34,462
MATT: The Allhammer is one of the prime gods of
family, craft, and construction of fine, important

2385
03:07:34,462 --> 03:07:44,095
things. It is the patron saint of all craftsmen,
blacksmiths, forgemasters, artisans, and from the

2386
03:07:44,095 --> 03:07:50,535
information you received from Ioun, the creator of
and last user of the Core Anvil.

2387
03:07:50,535 --> 03:07:57,071
MARISHA: So is it "the Allhammer lies beyond"? "Is
dark"?

2388
03:07:57,071 --> 03:08:02,492
MATT: It was an exit phrase placed on this door by
the last person who was in this.

2389
03:08:02,492 --> 03:08:06,523
MARISHA: Here the Crafter's Hall remains dark, the
Allhammer--

2390
03:08:06,523 --> 03:08:08,089
LAURA: Watch over us.

2391
03:08:08,089 --> 03:08:14,830
MARISHA: Watch over us. Something about watching
over us. Yeah, validate free parking.

2392
03:08:14,830 --> 03:08:19,553
TALIESIN: Objects in hammer are closer than they
appear.

2393
03:08:19,553 --> 03:08:31,746
SAM: I'll fly back and report to the rest in my
pristine body. My pristine, hairless body. And

2394
03:08:31,746 --> 03:08:33,899
that is what I saw.

2395
03:08:33,899 --> 03:08:36,764
LAURA: That was all in our heads?

2396
03:08:36,764 --> 03:08:38,007
SAM: Yes.

2397
03:08:38,007 --> 03:08:41,757
TRAVIS: I think that's what we're looking for,
right?

2398
03:08:41,757 --> 03:08:43,089
LAURA: Yeah, let's go.

2399
03:08:43,089 --> 03:08:46,127
LIAM: It was a flight down, yeah?

2400
03:08:46,127 --> 03:08:50,824
SAM: Hold on one second. (blowing water bubbles)

2401
03:08:50,824 --> 03:08:58,107
(laughter)

2402
03:08:58,107 --> 03:09:01,863
SAM: I'm back to being pristine.

2403
03:09:01,913 --> 03:09:08,190
MATT: Just so everyone here understands, imagine
between most conversations, there's somebody doing

2404
03:09:08,190 --> 03:09:10,385
that into a small jar of water.

2405
03:09:10,385 --> 03:09:17,186
SAM: (blowing water bubbles) And it's all cloudy
now from everybody.

2406
03:09:17,186 --> 03:09:26,233
LAURA: How often can you re-up that jar? Oh god,
it's nasty water.

2407
03:09:26,233 --> 03:09:29,126
LIAM: You're motorboating a gravy bowl.

2408
03:09:29,126 --> 03:09:34,015
SAM: It's like a horse trough. There's hair.

2409
03:09:34,015 --> 03:09:37,076
MATT: It is getting a little thick.

2410
03:09:37,076 --> 03:09:41,798
(laughter)

2411
03:09:41,798 --> 03:09:43,404
MATT: Oh god.

2412
03:09:43,404 --> 03:09:47,129
LAURA: Should we head down there? Did it seem like
you could pass through that door?

2413
03:09:47,129 --> 03:09:49,129
SAM: Oh, I didn't try the door.

2414
03:09:49,129 --> 03:09:51,045
LAURA: You didn't try to get through it?

2415
03:09:51,045 --> 03:09:52,385
SAM: Sorry!

2416
03:09:52,385 --> 03:09:54,600
LAURA: It's all right. We can find a way. It's
just a door.

2417
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:56,180
SAM: It's just a door; we'll be fine.

2418
03:09:56,180 --> 03:10:01,514
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're great entering doors. Great
history with doors. Let's go.

2419
03:10:01,514 --> 03:10:05,330
MATT: Who's doing what to get down there?

2420
03:10:05,330 --> 03:10:06,723
TALIESIN: I'm walking down there.

2421
03:10:06,723 --> 03:10:08,451
MATT: You (footsteps) on the side.

2422
03:10:08,451 --> 03:10:16,029
LAURA: I am flying down with the broom. Does
anybody else need to ride? Do you need to bamf

2423
03:10:16,029 --> 03:10:17,753
your wings out, or do you want to get on the
broom?

2424
03:10:17,753 --> 03:10:20,404
LIAM: I'm going to save those. I'll get on the
broom. You're offering me a ride on the broom!

2425
03:10:20,404 --> 03:10:21,793
TRAVIS: I've got the carpet.

2426
03:10:21,793 --> 03:10:26,412
MARISHA: I'll take the carpet or whatever.

2427
03:10:26,412 --> 03:10:32,161
MATT: Grog and Keyleth on the carpet. You two on
the broom. You flying. We're good. The rest of you

2428
03:10:32,201 --> 03:10:38,261
guys descend down at a 45-degree grade and make it
past where the lava stopped and cooled and

2429
03:10:38,261 --> 03:10:46,719
collected and thickened up. Eventually, you find
the area where it drops off into darkness below in

2430
03:10:46,719 --> 03:10:53,438
this cylindrical tunnel. You make it down the 30
or so feet to where it stops. It takes you a

2431
03:10:53,438 --> 03:10:59,443
moment, based on where Scanlan points you towards,
but you can make out the runes he was mentioning.

2432
03:10:59,443 --> 03:11:01,835
Percy, you're the only one who can read them.

2433
03:11:01,835 --> 03:11:03,907
TALIESIN: More of that. All right.

2434
03:11:03,907 --> 03:11:07,133
MARISHA: What? What does it say?

2435
03:11:07,133 --> 03:11:11,215
TALIESIN: It's a "shop's closed," I suppose.

2436
03:11:11,215 --> 03:11:12,684
LAURA: Can we reopen it?

2437
03:11:12,684 --> 03:11:21,596
MATT: No indicator of that. It was essentially,
(door click) "Key is locked up forever. Bye! Bless

2438
03:11:21,596 --> 03:11:22,925
"this seal."

2439
03:11:22,925 --> 03:11:26,238
LAURA: Bust through this shit or undo it? Do we
have a way to cancel the seal out?

2440
03:11:26,238 --> 03:11:32,516
MARISHA: So it's quite literally a family
business. We're closed, retired. Bars in front of it.

2441
03:11:32,516 --> 03:11:40,060
MATT: You get that sense. The forge was made by
and for the use of the Allhammer, and the

2442
03:11:40,060 --> 03:11:44,882
Allhammer is locked somewhere on his own plane
across the other side of the Divine Gate and has

2443
03:11:44,882 --> 03:11:46,584
been for 800 years.

2444
03:11:46,584 --> 03:11:55,638
LIAM: We've got a god-made doorway in front of us.
Something-made door, right. Natural rock around it

2445
03:11:55,638 --> 03:11:57,183
or is everything carved?

2446
03:11:57,183 --> 03:12:01,936
MATT: Natural volcanic rock. It's that same
crumbly, porous black stone.

2447
03:12:01,936 --> 03:12:04,965
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch the doors.

2448
03:12:04,965 --> 03:12:09,821
MATT: It feels like the rest of the surrounding
stone.

2449
03:12:09,821 --> 03:12:11,641
TALIESIN: There's no obvious mechanism for
opening it?

2450
03:12:11,641 --> 03:12:13,360
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2451
03:12:13,360 --> 03:12:16,175
LAURA: Can I pray to Pelor?

2452
03:12:16,175 --> 03:12:21,932
TALIESIN: That's awful. No. Six.

2453
03:12:21,932 --> 03:12:25,777
MATT: No current sign of anything.

2454
03:12:25,777 --> 03:12:32,662
TALIESIN: Anytime I look for anything worthwhile,
I stare at rock going, huh! Found a rock.

2455
03:12:32,662 --> 03:12:37,063
LAURA: I'm going to pray to Pelor. I don't know if
it makes a difference.

2456
03:12:37,063 --> 03:12:38,915
MATT: What are you going to say?

2457
03:12:38,915 --> 03:12:50,525
LAURA: I'm going to say: well. We are here at a
doorway. I don't know if you speak to the

2458
03:12:50,525 --> 03:12:57,678
Allhammer, if you know anything about this, but if
you have any way to help us get through this, now

2459
03:12:57,678 --> 03:13:05,724
would be the time. Trying to do good work here for
you and all of mankind.

2460
03:13:05,724 --> 03:13:09,255
TRAVIS: What about your bean?

2461
03:13:09,255 --> 03:13:13,968
LAURA: Oh yeah. Well, I'm going to take the bean
out and say all that shit again with the bean in

2462
03:13:13,968 --> 03:13:21,688
between my hands. I'm going to whisper it to the
bean because it's part of him.

2463
03:13:21,688 --> 03:13:24,787
MARISHA: Can you hear the ocean?

2464
03:13:24,787 --> 03:13:35,208
MATT: Ocean bean. Putting the words and thoughts
out there. Prayer is still a foreign thing to you

2465
03:13:35,208 --> 03:13:36,826
that you're still learning to do.

2466
03:13:36,826 --> 03:13:38,642
LAURA: That's why it was so good.

2467
03:13:38,642 --> 03:13:50,269
MATT: There's no words that respond, but you do
get a warm sense pushing you forward. You get the

2468
03:13:50,269 --> 03:13:56,094
idea from whatever guidance Pelor is sending your
direction that you can translate from your only

2469
03:13:56,094 --> 03:14:04,311
recently somewhat-faithful heart that you're on
the right path. That's as much as you can muster

2470
03:14:04,311 --> 03:14:06,069
from the conversation.

2471
03:14:06,069 --> 03:14:07,599
LAURA: Thanks.

2472
03:14:07,599 --> 03:14:17,633
TRAVIS: I don't want to jump the gun, but I did
punch a volcano today. This door, probably not too

2473
03:14:17,633 --> 03:14:26,678
big a tuna for me to filet, you know what I mean?
Unless the runes say, "If you punch, melt you will."

2474
03:14:26,678 --> 03:14:29,596
SAM: It didn't say anything like that.

2475
03:14:29,596 --> 03:14:30,815
TRAVIS: It didn't?

2476
03:14:30,815 --> 03:14:33,774
MARISHA: It seems like it's just closed.

2477
03:14:33,774 --> 03:14:38,045
LAURA: Are they glowing runes? Are they magical
runes? Do they seem like they're magic?

2478
03:14:38,045 --> 03:14:41,504
MATT: This is an interesting point I should have
recalled. Grog, are you still in your large form or not?

2479
03:14:41,504 --> 03:14:43,034
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2480
03:14:43,086 --> 03:14:47,566
MATT: How did you use the magic carpet to get
across? That carpet will not carry you in your

2481
03:14:47,566 --> 03:14:48,609
large form.

2482
03:14:48,609 --> 03:14:50,143
TRAVIS: Oh, good point.

2483
03:14:50,143 --> 03:14:54,632
LAURA: You're little. Or you could have--

2484
03:14:54,779 --> 03:14:58,846
TALIESIN: Just slid down.

2485
03:14:58,846 --> 03:15:02,080
LAURA: Oh yeah, could you have stretched to either
side and he does a Ninja Warrior shit down the

2486
03:15:02,103 --> 03:15:04,086
tube?

2487
03:15:04,086 --> 03:15:07,006
TRAVIS: Well, we don't know how wide. How wide?

2488
03:15:07,006 --> 03:15:08,450
LAURA: Well, that's what I mean.

2489
03:15:08,450 --> 03:15:11,474
MATT: The passageway heading downward would
probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of

2490
03:15:11,474 --> 03:15:15,734
between 15 to 20 feet.

2491
03:15:15,734 --> 03:15:23,630
LAURA: What about a Wonder Woman situation where
you (impacts). Because you got the siege gauntlets

2492
03:15:23,630 --> 03:15:26,658
on? And you make handholds?

2493
03:15:26,658 --> 03:15:28,219
LIAM: How long a drop was it?

2494
03:15:28,219 --> 03:15:34,153
MATT: Well, the drop wasn't the issue. It was the
40 feet of lava that was curling down.

2495
03:15:34,153 --> 03:15:37,056
TRAVIS: You could fly down and put me in the
necklace, if you want.

2496
03:15:37,056 --> 03:15:42,264
LAURA: Yeah, sure, that's what I did. Popped
Trinket out, flew back up, grabbed Grog, came back

2497
03:15:42,264 --> 03:15:43,348
down.

2498
03:15:43,348 --> 03:15:45,045
MATT: From a logistical standpoint, I recalled
that.

2499
03:15:45,045 --> 03:15:46,346
TRAVIS: Good call.

2500
03:15:46,346 --> 03:15:49,387
MATT: Okay, so what are you guys going to do?

2501
03:15:49,387 --> 03:15:51,285
TALIESIN: Are the runes glowing? Are the runes not
glowing?

2502
03:15:51,285 --> 03:15:55,118
MATT: No, the runes aren't glowing. You get the
sense, Scanlan, that it was less that they were

2503
03:15:55,118 --> 03:15:58,526
glowing, more that your truesight revealed the
presence--

2504
03:15:58,526 --> 03:16:01,114
SAM: To me, everything is glowing a little bit.

2505
03:16:01,114 --> 03:16:05,000
MATT: You are a little Neo in the Matrix in this
new physical form.

2506
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:15,602
TALIESIN: Tommy Wiseau is what I'm getting from
this. I'm going to take the Sun Stone out of its

2507
03:16:15,602 --> 03:16:20,178
little container, and really light up the room,
and just illuminate the whole room now.

2508
03:16:20,178 --> 03:16:23,575
LAURA: Is there a door knob or anything that looks
like a seal?

2509
03:16:23,575 --> 03:16:27,104
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2510
03:16:27,104 --> 03:16:28,688
TALIESIN: Thank you, somebody.

2511
03:16:28,688 --> 03:16:30,875
LAURA: 18.

2512
03:16:30,875 --> 03:16:31,927
LIAM: 22.

2513
03:16:31,927 --> 03:16:36,389
MATT: 22. Glancing about, with the help of his
light, as well, you look and you can see most of

2514
03:16:36,389 --> 03:16:44,070
the rock is jagged and broken in places, and as
you feel the edges, some parts flake off

2515
03:16:44,070 --> 03:16:50,423
relatively easy, and when you get to the section
of where that rectangular piece of the wall is

2516
03:16:50,423 --> 03:16:57,554
that the glyphs are put across, it looks like it's
a little smoothed over, like someone smoothed it

2517
03:16:57,554 --> 03:17:05,940
down to make this intentional seal, but there's no
sign of any sort of keyhole or handle or

2518
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:06,914
anything.

2519
03:17:06,914 --> 03:17:08,111
LAURA: Maybe you could push it?

2520
03:17:08,111 --> 03:17:11,021
TRAVIS: Let's try being polite, first. I will
knock on the door.

2521
03:17:11,021 --> 03:17:15,536
MATT: It's heavy stone.

2522
03:17:15,536 --> 03:17:20,342
TRAVIS: All right, fuck this. I try and push the
door either in and to either side.

2523
03:17:20,342 --> 03:17:21,816
MATT: Make a strength check.

2524
03:17:21,816 --> 03:17:27,880
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Go Strongjaw, go!

2525
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:29,595
TRAVIS: 17.

2526
03:17:29,595 --> 03:17:31,214
SAM: You're inspired.

2527
03:17:31,214 --> 03:17:34,551
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'll use that shit.

2528
03:17:34,551 --> 03:17:36,533
MATT: It's a d12.

2529
03:17:36,533 --> 03:17:41,829
TRAVIS: Oh, it is? Oh shit. Awesome. 26.

2530
03:17:41,829 --> 03:17:52,524
MATT: 26! You jam your hands into the wall and
push. As you push and shove, your fingers are

2531
03:17:52,524 --> 03:17:57,971
grinding and breaking the actual stone until they
feel something metal. It goes from crumbling stone

2532
03:17:57,971 --> 03:18:04,168
to a metallic surface, and as you pull your hands
back a little bit, you pull away these giant

2533
03:18:04,168 --> 03:18:10,439
chunks of volcanic stone, the actual runes and
glyphs breaking around your grasp, and you can

2534
03:18:10,439 --> 03:18:16,889
look inside and see hammered, dark metal on the
other side. You then put your hand in and shove as

2535
03:18:16,889 --> 03:18:23,802
hard as you can, and with a very faint grinding,
you feel it give about an inch, then another inch.

2536
03:18:23,802 --> 03:18:29,298
And then eventually, it gives out suddenly, and
you watch as suddenly the entire square structure

2537
03:18:29,298 --> 03:18:41,513
falls inward with a slamming echo sound that
echoes again and again, down a stairway that

2538
03:18:41,513 --> 03:18:44,689
disappears from view about 20 feet ahead of you.

2539
03:18:44,689 --> 03:18:46,569
LAURA: Check for traps!

2540
03:18:46,569 --> 03:18:50,755
TRAVIS: You got it. Natural 20.

2541
03:18:50,755 --> 03:18:54,226
(laughter)

2542
03:18:54,226 --> 03:18:55,787
TRAVIS: That's not my thing.

2543
03:18:55,787 --> 03:19:01,242
MATT: Natural 20 doesn't mean you succeed,
necessarily.

2544
03:19:01,242 --> 03:19:05,252
LIAM: 18 for me.

2545
03:19:05,252 --> 03:19:13,003
MATT: All right. Both of you glance throughout the
initial--

2546
03:19:13,003 --> 03:19:16,055
LIAM: Grog, what do your elven eyes see?

2547
03:19:16,055 --> 03:19:22,618
MATT: -- steps into the hallway, which is now
littered with broken rock

2548
03:19:22,618 --> 03:19:29,535
for the first ten feet or
so, with a platform where the large rectangular

2549
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:39,318
metal structure fell over. No signs of any traps,
no signs of any tweaking with the floor or walls

2550
03:19:39,318 --> 03:19:50,070
for any triggers. You do notice that the metal
surfaces here are a texture of rough, hammered

2551
03:19:50,070 --> 03:19:54,710
metal. You can see the series of small
indentations, like all these have been hammered

2552
03:19:54,710 --> 03:20:03,258
into place, and it looks like the seams where
these large metallic wall slabs would be have a

2553
03:20:03,258 --> 03:20:09,914
thin little placed bar over those, as well. You've
gone from central volcano, natural, emerging and

2554
03:20:09,914 --> 03:20:17,762
expanding rock and lava to a place of very
intense, intended construct.

2555
03:20:17,762 --> 03:20:20,878
TRAVIS: I feel like this is it.

2556
03:20:20,878 --> 03:20:25,367
LAURA: Would my greedy eyes know what kind of
metal it is?

2557
03:20:25,367 --> 03:20:29,054
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2558
03:20:29,054 --> 03:20:33,881
SAM: It's all pewter. Pewter everywhere.

2559
03:20:33,881 --> 03:20:37,619
LAURA: Intelligence. Investigation?

2560
03:20:37,619 --> 03:20:43,228
MATT: Well, this would be just an intelligence
check. Just a straight modifier.

2561
03:20:43,228 --> 03:20:45,058
LAURA: (laughs) Oh! Ten.

2562
03:20:45,058 --> 03:20:52,509
MATT: Ten? (sighs) You're not entirely certain of
the metal. It is a dark, dull, slate gray. A

2563
03:20:52,509 --> 03:20:57,551
little darker than that, even, and elements of the
edges appear to be almost red. Almost like a rust

2564
03:20:57,551 --> 03:21:02,237
or ruddy color, but you don't recognize what type
of metal it is, necessarily.

2565
03:21:02,237 --> 03:21:07,198
LIAM: I'm stealthing. I'm stealthing down the
steps.

2566
03:21:07,198 --> 03:21:15,792
LAURA: I did cast Pass Without a Trace on all of
us again a while ago. I said it. I even marked it

2567
03:21:15,792 --> 03:21:17,726
off after the fight.

2568
03:21:17,726 --> 03:21:19,386
MATT: Okay. You rolled a natural 20?

2569
03:21:19,386 --> 03:21:21,190
LIAM: Yep. Using a Luck. But yeah.

2570
03:21:21,190 --> 03:21:23,464
MATT: Using Luck. You've used three Lucks today.

2571
03:21:23,464 --> 03:21:26,709
LIAM: Three of my four, according to your campaign
guide?

2572
03:21:26,709 --> 03:21:29,585
MATT: The campaign guide was something that was
for other people to use...

2573
03:21:29,585 --> 03:21:32,546
(laughter)

2574
03:21:32,546 --> 03:21:40,090
MATT: As sort of an inside joke for the previous
more than three Lucks.

2575
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:44,744
LIAM: Well, that was my third, not my fourth.

2576
03:21:44,744 --> 03:21:51,521
MATT: Right, I'm saying for the purposes of the
guide being released and you embracing your

2577
03:21:51,521 --> 03:22:05,189
fate-touched nature and the extremely dutiful
adherence to the law of your Raven Queen... sure,

2578
03:22:05,189 --> 03:22:07,755
I'll give you a fate-touched additional fourth
Luck.

2579
03:22:07,755 --> 03:22:09,763
MARISHA: He's throwing you a bone.

2580
03:22:09,763 --> 03:22:16,812
SAM: You know why? Because he knows Liam bought
the book.

2581
03:22:16,812 --> 03:22:20,307
LIAM: I did buy the book. I bought the book in the
first hour.

2582
03:22:20,307 --> 03:22:23,319
SAM: I bought the book, too. What do I get?

2583
03:22:23,319 --> 03:22:27,267
MATT: You get an awesome angel dick.

2584
03:22:27,267 --> 03:22:31,876
(laughter)

2585
03:22:31,876 --> 03:22:33,805
LAURA: Your one-inch cube suddenly grows.

2586
03:22:33,805 --> 03:22:35,641
LIAM: To two inches!

2587
03:22:35,641 --> 03:22:37,323
MATT: Angel wang, by the way, is a good band
name.

2588
03:22:37,323 --> 03:22:39,114
TRAVIS: (singing) Angel wang.

2589
03:22:39,114 --> 03:22:43,303
MATT: All right.

2590
03:22:43,303 --> 03:22:51,608
SAM: I'm going to fly over to Vex and wordlessly
say to her, be honest. Do you think I'm more

2591
03:22:51,608 --> 03:22:54,501
handsome like this or as normal Scanlan?

2592
03:22:54,501 --> 03:23:01,658
LAURA: I'm going to think in my head, Scanlan's
the best.

2593
03:23:01,658 --> 03:23:07,144
SAM: Be aware that as a divine being, I can sense
any lie.

2594
03:23:07,144 --> 03:23:13,626
(laughter)

2595
03:23:13,626 --> 03:23:24,105
LAURA: Scanlan, darling. You're fucking hot right
now, all right? But I love you like you were.

2596
03:23:24,105 --> 03:23:30,020
You're always my favorite when you're just
yourself.

2597
03:23:30,020 --> 03:23:34,904
SAM: All right. Thank you. I turn my little naked
butt to her and fly away.

2598
03:23:34,904 --> 03:23:37,203
(laughter)

2599
03:23:37,203 --> 03:23:41,279
MATT: All right. So, this hallway that you guys
have pushed through now, it's about 20 feet wide,

2600
03:23:41,279 --> 03:23:49,197
30 feet tall, and this long ceiling gradually
curves to an apex point, like two adjoining sides

2601
03:23:49,197 --> 03:23:53,911
of a roof. And it continues to progress forward,
and then descends with the staircase.

2602
03:23:53,911 --> 03:23:56,766
TRAVIS: Are the walls hot to the touch, since
they're metal?

2603
03:23:56,766 --> 03:24:02,592
MATT: You put your hand out and feel it, and yes,
they are. Not like (sizzle), but your hand can

2604
03:24:02,592 --> 03:24:06,462
rest for a few seconds before you have to remove
it. They're very hot.

2605
03:24:06,462 --> 03:24:12,622
TRAVIS: We progress forward into the room down the
stairs. Wherever the stairs lead.

2606
03:24:12,622 --> 03:24:14,472
MATT: All right, so. You leading?

2607
03:24:14,472 --> 03:24:17,169
LIAM: Yeah, I'm 60 feet ahead with my 47 stealth
right now.

2608
03:24:17,169 --> 03:24:23,067
MATT: Right. Okay. So as you begin, first thing
you notice, the steps? They're long steps. They

2609
03:24:23,067 --> 03:24:27,871
are about three feet wide each step.

2610
03:24:27,871 --> 03:24:29,320
LIAM: God-sized.

2611
03:24:29,320 --> 03:24:35,128
MATT: So you're having to like, step, step, step,
leap down a few feet, continue again, leap down a

2612
03:24:35,128 --> 03:24:39,452
few feet, and each of you are doing this. Who here
does not have magic boots?

2613
03:24:39,452 --> 03:24:43,301
MARISHA: Me.

2614
03:24:43,301 --> 03:24:50,107
LAURA: I mean, just part of my armor. If that's
not boots, then it's probably just the front

2615
03:24:50,107 --> 03:24:51,383
guards, huh.

2616
03:24:51,383 --> 03:24:53,172
SAM: I don't.

2617
03:24:53,172 --> 03:24:54,587
MATT: You're flying. You're fine.

2618
03:24:54,587 --> 03:24:59,171
LAURA: But I've got my broom. That I just said I
was on.

2619
03:24:59,171 --> 03:25:04,728
MATT: Correct. So you're fine. You, as you're
walking, the ground is very hot, and you can

2620
03:25:04,728 --> 03:25:09,561
continue to move your feet in a way where it's not
too bad, but you get the sense if you were wearing

2621
03:25:09,561 --> 03:25:16,213
normal boots and not the usual Ashari-made,
leather setup that you work on, they would

2622
03:25:16,213 --> 03:25:18,751
probably be melting across the metal floor here.

2623
03:25:18,751 --> 03:25:21,809
LAURA: You want to hop up on this broom?

2624
03:25:21,809 --> 03:25:26,118
MARISHA: Oh, I'm just-- big strides. Big strides!

2625
03:25:26,118 --> 03:25:30,744
LAURA: All right. It looks awkward, but stay
there, if you'd rather.

2626
03:25:30,744 --> 03:25:34,647
MARISHA: I try to look more normal while still
taking big strides.

2627
03:25:34,647 --> 03:25:36,904
TRAVIS: It's not working.

2628
03:25:36,904 --> 03:25:38,247
MARISHA: No?

2629
03:25:38,247 --> 03:25:52,701
MATT: All right, so. The air itself now smells of
very caustic fumes mixed with the smell of burning

2630
03:25:52,701 --> 03:26:02,074
coal, but there is oxygen now in this chamber. You
can breathe. There's enough air to actually get a

2631
03:26:02,074 --> 03:26:07,243
lungful here and there, though it is still thin,
and there is still the toxic fume here that had

2632
03:26:07,243 --> 03:26:11,406
you not had the Heroes' Feast, you'd be having a
rough time. But you're not having to constantly

2633
03:26:11,406 --> 03:26:13,533
dip into the jug anymore.

2634
03:26:13,533 --> 03:26:18,395
TRAVIS: Did one of y'all growl just now? That was
you?

2635
03:26:18,395 --> 03:26:19,636
TALIESIN: That was me.

2636
03:26:19,636 --> 03:26:21,167
TRAVIS: Or did it come out of the speaker?

2637
03:26:21,167 --> 03:26:22,377
LIAM: You don't know.

2638
03:26:22,377 --> 03:26:24,301
TRAVIS: That shit scared me.

2639
03:26:24,301 --> 03:26:26,182
(laughter)

2640
03:26:26,182 --> 03:26:30,812
TRAVIS: That shit was too loud from a weird
direction. I got all haunted house for a second. I

2641
03:26:30,812 --> 03:26:32,563
was like, (gasps).

2642
03:26:32,563 --> 03:26:35,083
MATT: I cannot wait to get to Halloween Horror
Nights with you again.

2643
03:26:35,083 --> 03:26:37,401
LIAM: Travis Willingham's fatal flaw.

2644
03:26:37,401 --> 03:26:41,012
TRAVIS: I'm quick as hell. (laughs)

2645
03:26:41,012 --> 03:26:43,594
MATT: You are quick. That's why we leave you ten
feet ahead of us.

2646
03:26:43,594 --> 03:26:45,480
TALIESIN: You are the best jump scare.

2647
03:26:45,480 --> 03:26:48,512
MARISHA: One of these days you're going to break
someone's nose.

2648
03:26:48,512 --> 03:26:51,818
TRAVIS: I know. Ah! I'm so
sorry!

2649
03:26:51,818 --> 03:26:53,328
(laughter)

2650
03:26:53,328 --> 03:26:59,773
MATT: It's going to be glorious. Anyway, as you
descend the staircase, you ahead, make a

2651
03:26:59,773 --> 03:27:01,155
perception check.

2652
03:27:01,155 --> 03:27:06,627
LIAM: All right. I'm going to use your Pelor die.
Hey, that's good. Perception, you say? 27!

2653
03:27:06,627 --> 03:27:14,241
MATT: 27, okay. You continue down for about two
minutes or so, and even glancing ahead to the edge

2654
03:27:14,241 --> 03:27:19,224
of your visual range here in the darkness, because
there is no light source below at this point...

2655
03:27:19,224 --> 03:27:25,768
the stairs are continuing and continuing and
continuing, and you have no idea how long it'll go

2656
03:27:25,768 --> 03:27:35,498
for, but you begin to sense as you're walking, and
you hear this faint rhythmic, bassy rumble of a

2657
03:27:35,498 --> 03:27:43,824
low, nearly inaudible, drum-like beat, deeper than
any sound you've heard, quaking the ground ever so

2658
03:27:43,824 --> 03:28:00,594
faintly. (slow, rumbling pulses) And you can very
faintly feel it. You get down and move your

2659
03:28:00,594 --> 03:28:04,312
fingers to the ground, and for the moments before
the heat gets there, the next time you hear it,

2660
03:28:04,312 --> 03:28:08,922
you can feel a very faint vibration, only because
you are very perceptive at the moment.

2661
03:28:08,922 --> 03:28:12,654
LIAM: Is it exactly rhythmic? Precisely?

2662
03:28:12,654 --> 03:28:16,722
MATT: I'd say, with your high perception check,
you can tell that yes, it is precisely rhythmic.

2663
03:28:16,722 --> 03:28:22,373
LIAM: I think there's some sort of god-sized
machinery ahead of us. I think we're getting

2664
03:28:22,373 --> 03:28:23,720
close.

2665
03:28:23,720 --> 03:28:26,678
LAURA: Did you lose your earring because you're an
angel now?

2666
03:28:26,678 --> 03:28:28,446
TRAVIS: No, he keeps all his stuff.

2667
03:28:28,446 --> 03:28:39,939
SAM: I don't have the earring, but I can talk to
you telepathically in any language. How about

2668
03:28:39,939 --> 03:28:41,341
Italian, darling?

2669
03:28:41,341 --> 03:28:45,191
(laughter)

2670
03:28:45,191 --> 03:28:49,525
LAURA: Stop being creepy, Scanlan.

2671
03:28:49,525 --> 03:28:53,525
SAM: I sense my hour is coming to an end soon.

2672
03:28:53,525 --> 03:28:58,220
MATT: You guys are about 20 minutes out, both you
and Grog, before you lose your forms.

2673
03:28:58,220 --> 03:29:06,079
LIAM: Do you know binary? One, zero, zero, one,
zero, one, one, zero, one, zero, one...

2674
03:29:06,079 --> 03:29:08,004
MARISHA: Speak in Morse code.

2675
03:29:08,004 --> 03:29:17,601
MATT: Another ten, 15 minutes of descending these
stairs that seem to go on and on and on, and you

2676
03:29:17,601 --> 03:29:26,403
guys are starting to hear this (low rumbling), but
it is getting steadily louder the further down you

2677
03:29:26,403 --> 03:29:37,416
climb, Vax. You begin to see along the metallic
walls, occasionally, shapes in the metal. And you

2678
03:29:37,416 --> 03:29:46,214
glance over, Vax, and look, and you can see,
carved from the metal, humanoid, armored warriors

2679
03:29:46,214 --> 03:29:52,421
standing about ten or so feet tall, larger than
normal. Their poses vary. Some of them are on the

2680
03:29:52,421 --> 03:30:00,697
side, some of them are attacking, some of them are
defending, and about every 25 or 30 feet or so,

2681
03:30:00,697 --> 03:30:02,874
there will be one on one side or the other.

2682
03:30:02,874 --> 03:30:05,024
LIAM: Are they standing free, or are they carved
from the wall?

2683
03:30:05,024 --> 03:30:06,959
MATT: No, they're from the wall.

2684
03:30:06,959 --> 03:30:08,712
LAURA: They're drawings?

2685
03:30:08,712 --> 03:30:14,279
MATT: They're reliefs. They're metallic reliefs in
the wall.

2686
03:30:14,279 --> 03:30:17,089
TRAVIS: Not some metal Medusa that turned them
into metal?

2687
03:30:17,089 --> 03:30:20,786
MATT: Made of the same metal, it looks like, as
the walls around them.

2688
03:30:20,786 --> 03:30:22,587
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly inspect one.

2689
03:30:22,587 --> 03:30:25,574
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2690
03:30:25,574 --> 03:30:30,494
TALIESIN: I'm rolling terribly. Nine.

2691
03:30:30,494 --> 03:30:31,671
MATT: Nine.

2692
03:30:31,671 --> 03:30:36,806
LAURA: I want to look at them, too. I want to fly
up on my broom. I was going to say it and then he

2693
03:30:36,806 --> 03:30:38,300
said it.

2694
03:30:38,300 --> 03:30:41,679
TRAVIS: Please don't be golems that will come out
and fight us.

2695
03:30:41,679 --> 03:30:44,493
LAURA: Investigation? 22.

2696
03:30:44,493 --> 03:30:54,119
MATT: 22? Glancing around the seams, these appear
to be just reliefs in the wall. There is no deeper

2697
03:30:54,119 --> 03:31:00,155
seam. Their proportions are flattened. They are
designs in the wall.

2698
03:31:00,155 --> 03:31:05,805
TALIESIN: Does the style indicate anything?

2699
03:31:05,805 --> 03:31:14,392
MATT: The craftsmanship is extraordinary, the
detail. Because you rolled so high, you can tell

2700
03:31:14,392 --> 03:31:20,081
that these are just reliefs in the wall, but up
until that point, it looks like the detail in the

2701
03:31:20,081 --> 03:31:25,412
nooks and crannies are so microscopic, you can see
texture on the skin, almost. Like pores carved in.

2702
03:31:25,412 --> 03:31:30,688
It's immaculate. It's artistic, the level of
detail put into these.

2703
03:31:30,688 --> 03:31:35,836
MARISHA: Grog. Do you trust this?

2704
03:31:35,836 --> 03:31:38,586
TRAVIS: To what are you pointing?

2705
03:31:38,586 --> 03:31:48,323
MARISHA: The reliefs, the people in the wall?
Okay. It was a hypothetical question.

2706
03:31:48,323 --> 03:31:51,735
TRAVIS: Right. Do I trust the art?

2707
03:31:51,735 --> 03:32:02,267
MARISHA: Just to be safe, I cast Freedom of
Movement on Grog. Just in case.

2708
03:32:02,267 --> 03:32:05,227
TRAVIS: Ooh. I start popping and locking.

2709
03:32:05,227 --> 03:32:10,297
MARISHA: So loose. So free. So much movement.

2710
03:32:10,297 --> 03:32:16,062
MATT: So that lasts for an hour, great.

2711
03:32:16,062 --> 03:32:19,464
LAURA: I'm going to be stealthy. I don't want to
be noisy.

2712
03:32:19,464 --> 03:32:22,030
MATT: Okay. Roll stealth, please.

2713
03:32:22,030 --> 03:32:26,356
LAURA: 32.

2714
03:32:26,356 --> 03:32:29,963
MATT: Okay. So what is the marching order here,
please?

2715
03:32:29,963 --> 03:32:33,437
TRAVIS: I don't actually mind taking the lead on
this one.

2716
03:32:33,437 --> 03:32:34,701
MATT: Okay.

2717
03:32:34,701 --> 03:32:36,646
SAM: Do we have five minutes left, or less?

2718
03:32:36,646 --> 03:32:40,398
MATT: You're pushing about ten minutes or so at
this point.

2719
03:32:40,398 --> 03:32:42,087
TRAVIS: I think five to ten minutes, actually.

2720
03:32:42,087 --> 03:32:43,842
LAURA: Yeah, you had said 15.

2721
03:32:43,842 --> 03:32:46,463
TALIESIN: I love walking on the wall.

2722
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:49,196
SAM: We could stay like this forever.

2723
03:32:49,196 --> 03:32:52,697
TALIESIN: So I'll be in the middle of the group,
walking on the wall.

2724
03:32:52,697 --> 03:32:54,588
SAM: I'm so beautiful.

2725
03:32:54,588 --> 03:33:00,869
TRAVIS: You look over and Scanlan's going
(kisses).

2726
03:33:00,869 --> 03:33:02,611
SAM: So symmetrical.

2727
03:33:02,611 --> 03:33:04,797
LIAM: I'm actually going to hang back.

2728
03:33:04,797 --> 03:33:06,876
MATT: Okay, so Vax behind. It's Percy and Grog up
front.

2729
03:33:06,876 --> 03:33:09,875
LAURA: I'm going to go up behind Percy.

2730
03:33:09,875 --> 03:33:12,910
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be with Vex.

2731
03:33:12,910 --> 03:33:24,732
SAM: I will fly up next to Grog and put my Healing
Touch hand on his shoulder and heal him a lot.

2732
03:33:24,732 --> 03:33:32,896
(hums) 31.

2733
03:33:32,896 --> 03:33:35,152
MATT: You heal 31 hit points, Grog.

2734
03:33:35,152 --> 03:33:37,080
SAM: Oh, plus three. 34.

2735
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:38,144
MATT: There you go.

2736
03:33:38,144 --> 03:33:44,689
SAM: And you're also freed from any curse,
disease, or blindness that you have, just FYI.

2737
03:33:44,689 --> 03:33:50,519
LIAM: I'm also going to dump 20 hit points of Lay
on Hands on my own damn self.

2738
03:33:50,519 --> 03:33:52,228
MATT: All righty.

2739
03:33:52,228 --> 03:33:58,317
MARISHA: Wait, is that ding to your saving throws
considered a curse?

2740
03:33:58,317 --> 03:34:01,000
MATT: It is a curse that can only be broken by a
god.

2741
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:07,964
LAURA: If he fucking brings it up to a god. He
doesn't even realize he has it.

2742
03:34:07,964 --> 03:34:11,605
TRAVIS: I tried to talk to Pelor, but people were
like, "No, don't talk to Pelor."

2743
03:34:11,605 --> 03:34:13,344
LAURA: What are you fucking talking about?

2744
03:34:13,344 --> 03:34:14,868
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

2745
03:34:14,868 --> 03:34:24,503
MATT: Grog, continuing the charge forward, taking
the steps, eventually you begin to see a source of

2746
03:34:24,503 --> 03:34:31,434
some light. A faint, orangish-red light. Your
initial instinct, based on your previous travels

2747
03:34:31,434 --> 03:34:39,015
through here, is molten rock. It's a very similar
orangish-red color from this distance. As you

2748
03:34:39,015 --> 03:34:48,312
descend, step upon heavy step upon heavy step, you
watch as you can see a square orange opening

2749
03:34:48,312 --> 03:34:58,192
below. As in, the pointed hallway that leads you
down comes to an end, and the stairs descend into

2750
03:34:58,192 --> 03:34:59,424
a chamber.

2751
03:34:59,424 --> 03:35:05,911
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

2752
03:35:05,911 --> 03:35:11,065
LAURA: Would Trinket's little feet hurt if he was
on the ground?

2753
03:35:11,065 --> 03:35:13,926
MATT: Do you want to put Trinket out of your
necklace?

2754
03:35:13,926 --> 03:35:17,407
LAURA: Well, I figure I would have tried to put
him out when we got in the tunnel, but if his feet

2755
03:35:17,407 --> 03:35:19,314
were hurting, I would have put him back in the
necklace.

2756
03:35:19,314 --> 03:35:21,432
MATT: I would say Trinket's not comfortable,
yeah.

2757
03:35:21,432 --> 03:35:23,516
LAURA: Okay, I'll keep him in, then.

2758
03:35:23,516 --> 03:35:31,758
MATT: Okay. So. As you descend, Grog, the
staircase continues below as the hallway comes to

2759
03:35:31,758 --> 03:35:39,997
an end, and you find yourself descending into the
center of a massive hexagonal chamber. The walls

2760
03:35:39,997 --> 03:35:46,025
climb about 25 feet on each of the hexagonal
sides. There's one flat wall ahead of you, and you

2761
03:35:46,025 --> 03:35:50,765
assume probably one behind, though you cannot see
it from your current perspective on the staircase.

2762
03:35:50,765 --> 03:35:57,662
You can see that the walls are still made from the
long plates of intricate, hammered metal, black

2763
03:35:57,662 --> 03:36:04,872
and red-tinted with dust and rock and whatever
other materials were forged into the actual metal.

2764
03:36:04,872 --> 03:36:09,807
The support girders of dark red metal marks the
seam at every wall-plate, like when you entered

2765
03:36:09,807 --> 03:36:11,501
the hallway above.

2766
03:36:11,501 --> 03:36:18,968
Central to the chamber ahead of you, across the
wall that you see there, there is a glowing pit of

2767
03:36:18,968 --> 03:36:27,383
heated coals, about 15 feet on any side that marks
the floor before a giant, metal wall with two

2768
03:36:27,383 --> 03:36:34,167
X-shaped cross beams that hit the corners of where
that wall begins on each side. And in the center

2769
03:36:34,167 --> 03:36:46,369
where they meet, you see a raised relief of solid
gold bolted there that surrounds an opening of

2770
03:36:46,369 --> 03:36:49,373
some kind. There's a space in that golden relief.

2771
03:36:49,373 --> 03:36:57,831
TRAVIS: What's the floor look like from here to
there? The same surface?

2772
03:36:57,831 --> 03:36:59,840
MATT: Same metallic surface.

2773
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:01,947
TRAVIS: Any seams, or just smooth?

2774
03:37:01,947 --> 03:37:08,516
MATT: Well, no, for the floor in here, it would be
fairly smooth.

2775
03:37:08,516 --> 03:37:11,416
LAURA: How high off the ground is that relief?

2776
03:37:11,416 --> 03:37:18,064
MATT: It's 25 feet to the ceiling, and it's
halfway down, so it's about 12 and a half feet in

2777
03:37:18,064 --> 03:37:22,450
the center, so from the ground, you'd have to get
up to see it.

2778
03:37:22,450 --> 03:37:24,184
TRAVIS: I move closer towards that.

2779
03:37:24,184 --> 03:37:28,159
MATT: Okay. You walk up, and you come to the very
bottom of the last step. (grunts) Leap onto the

2780
03:37:28,159 --> 03:37:34,980
ground, walk forward to the edge of where the
coals are, there at the base of your feet. You

2781
03:37:34,980 --> 03:37:37,456
glance up and you can see it. Make a perception
check.

2782
03:37:37,456 --> 03:37:41,398
TRAVIS: Hold on. 17.

2783
03:37:41,398 --> 03:37:47,797
MATT: All right, you glance up and you can see the
relief of solid gold. The opening in it is

2784
03:37:47,797 --> 03:37:53,980
triangle-shaped, roughly one foot across from
point to point, like that. It comes into a

2785
03:37:53,980 --> 03:37:59,669
triangular point. And it's about that size; it's
about a foot, and then a foot, and then a foot.

2786
03:37:59,669 --> 03:38:05,102
LAURA: I think you're supposed to stick your hand
in it, Grog.

2787
03:38:05,102 --> 03:38:10,203
TRAVIS: It's just the triangle shape, right?
There's nothing else around it?

2788
03:38:10,203 --> 03:38:18,206
MATT: It's a weird rough circle, and then the
triangle is carved into the center of it. The two

2789
03:38:18,206 --> 03:38:23,013
walls immediately to the right and the left of
that, where the hexagonal pulls back to each side,

2790
03:38:23,013 --> 03:38:27,678
you see two more of those metal warrior reliefs
that you saw earlier in the hallway.

2791
03:38:27,678 --> 03:38:34,448
TRAVIS: And the coals are in a circle?

2792
03:38:34,448 --> 03:38:39,732
MATT: The coals are in a square section, a 15
by 15-foot square section of the floor in front of

2793
03:38:39,732 --> 03:38:45,189
you that leads right up to the wall with the giant
X meeting the seams in the relief.

2794
03:38:45,189 --> 03:38:50,254
TRAVIS: (sighs) Might have to Tony Robbins this
shit, right?

2795
03:38:50,254 --> 03:38:55,354
LAURA: Does it look like anything's supposed to go
in the triangle? Does it look like a keyhole?

2796
03:38:55,354 --> 03:39:03,585
MATT: It looks like a gold relief that has a
triangular hole in it. That's all you can see.

2797
03:39:03,585 --> 03:39:06,536
LAURA: Can we see how deep the hole goes?

2798
03:39:06,536 --> 03:39:08,464
MATT: You'd have to get closer to it.

2799
03:39:08,464 --> 03:39:11,264
LAURA: I want to get close to it on my broom and
look at it.

2800
03:39:11,264 --> 03:39:14,327
MATT: All right, you fly up above the coals, and
the heat emanating from the coals below you is

2801
03:39:14,327 --> 03:39:22,283
extremely hot. You can see it warping the air
above it, so you have to protect yourself a bit

2802
03:39:22,283 --> 03:39:28,038
and squint the eyes, and you swear you can smell
the scent of burning hair. And you get up close

2803
03:39:28,038 --> 03:39:35,764
and you can see the relief, perhaps some sort of
triangular or pyramid-like shape would slip into it.

2804
03:39:35,764 --> 03:39:41,144
It looks like all the corners eventually converge
to a point on the interior of it.

2805
03:39:41,144 --> 03:39:45,299
LAURA: Okay. All right. I back up so that I'm not
in the fumes.

2806
03:39:45,299 --> 03:39:49,793
TRAVIS: Is there anything else in the room besides
the two reliefs on either side that we can see? Tools?

2807
03:39:49,793 --> 03:39:54,671
MATT: Do you guys want to walk around the back of
the staircase? As you guys move around the back of

2808
03:39:54,671 --> 03:40:02,218
the staircase, the wall on the opposite side of
that relief contains a third armored warrior

2809
03:40:02,218 --> 03:40:07,571
relief embedded in the wall. You can see there are
four pillars right along the side of where the

2810
03:40:07,571 --> 03:40:16,376
staircase descends that contain bolted-in, large
braziers that contain ever-burning flames,

2811
03:40:16,376 --> 03:40:20,711
flickering, that give that orange-red glow,
similar to the coals you saw embedded in the

2812
03:40:20,711 --> 03:40:28,205
ground as you arrived. And then on the back side
of the staircase and the column that held it

2813
03:40:28,205 --> 03:40:36,382
aloft, you recognize it immediately, Grog,
strangely. Because while you've not cared or

2814
03:40:36,382 --> 03:40:43,868
understood what these things are before, suddenly
you know what it is. You see a large metal-- it

2815
03:40:43,868 --> 03:40:51,792
looks like a well, almost, but there is a furnace
built into it and a number of tools that are

2816
03:40:51,792 --> 03:40:56,840
hanging to the side, small tongs and heavy leather
gauntlets. This is a smelter.

2817
03:40:56,840 --> 03:41:07,002
LAURA: Oh, that's where we have to smelt the
platinum. Do we see anything around the room that

2818
03:41:07,002 --> 03:41:10,153
looks like it could fit in that pyramid shape?

2819
03:41:10,153 --> 03:41:20,908
SAM: I'm going to cast, again, Detect Good and
Evil, and do a swoop around and see if I sense any

2820
03:41:20,908 --> 03:41:24,920
creatures or magically consecrated objects.

2821
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:31,396
MATT: Okay. You swoop around the room. You detect
no evil. You detect no magically consecrated

2822
03:41:31,396 --> 03:41:38,999
objects. And at that point, the spell's about to
fade or become permanent.

2823
03:41:38,999 --> 03:41:40,977
SAM: (sighs) Big choice.

2824
03:41:40,977 --> 03:41:45,255
LAURA: You mean, you'll stay like that forever?
You can't undo it?

2825
03:41:45,255 --> 03:41:52,501
SAM: Yes, my child. I will drop the spell.

2826
03:41:52,501 --> 03:42:00,262
MATT: Okay. And with that, a smaller Scanlan form
appears, the planetar angelic form vanishing, and

2827
03:42:00,262 --> 03:42:03,320
he drops about four feet and lands on his feet on
the ground.

2828
03:42:03,320 --> 03:42:08,678
SAM: I feel my back, covered in hair. I'm back.

2829
03:42:08,678 --> 03:42:14,064
MATT: And a moment later, Grog, your form drops as
well, and you revert back to normal Grog size.

2830
03:42:14,064 --> 03:42:15,230
Still massive.

2831
03:42:15,230 --> 03:42:23,916
TRAVIS: So we're supposed to smelt the platinum,
right? Melt it down. And then we use our magic

2832
03:42:23,916 --> 03:42:27,774
beans to make the Prime Trammels.

2833
03:42:27,774 --> 03:42:30,040
TALIESIN: Do I understand how this triangle
works?

2834
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:35,406
MATT: This triangle does not at all resemble any
of the designs that you had imbued upon you.

2835
03:42:35,406 --> 03:42:40,091
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop up to take a better
look at it, as well.

2836
03:42:40,091 --> 03:42:46,413
MATT: Okay. So you walk up the side and look into
it and you can see it's a triangle, and then

2837
03:42:46,413 --> 03:42:51,801
pushing inward, all the points converge on the
inside where it would fit a pyramid structure,

2838
03:42:51,801 --> 03:42:54,225
about one foot on each side, corner to corner.

2839
03:42:54,225 --> 03:42:57,534
TALIESIN: And the point at which they connect, is
that about a quarter size, would you say?

2840
03:42:57,534 --> 03:42:59,733
MATT: The point where it connects, it goes to a
complete point.

2841
03:42:59,733 --> 03:43:00,998
TALIESIN: Complete point, okay.

2842
03:43:00,998 --> 03:43:07,027
TRAVIS: And that relief is in the middle of two
crossbeams? So you couldn't push the crossbeams

2843
03:43:07,027 --> 03:43:08,916
over and lay it down flat?

2844
03:43:08,916 --> 03:43:11,660
MATT: Well, the cross beams are bolted to the
actual wall.

2845
03:43:11,660 --> 03:43:14,330
TRAVIS: It's not something we have to lay flat.

2846
03:43:14,330 --> 03:43:16,501
LIAM: Did you say there were two metal warriors?

2847
03:43:16,501 --> 03:43:19,637
MATT: There are two metal warriors to the right
and left and then one on the back wall.

2848
03:43:19,637 --> 03:43:24,281
LIAM: And are they separated from where we are by
hot coals, or can you walk right up to them?

2849
03:43:24,281 --> 03:43:26,952
MATT: The only hot coals are the ones that reside
directly beneath the relief.

2850
03:43:26,952 --> 03:43:31,076
LIAM: Okay, so I'm going to check one of those
out. See if it's any different than what we passed

2851
03:43:31,076 --> 03:43:32,693
in that hallway.

2852
03:43:32,693 --> 03:43:34,633
MARISHA: And you said there were three warriors?

2853
03:43:34,633 --> 03:43:35,671
MATT: Yes.

2854
03:43:35,671 --> 03:43:38,523
LAURA: And we can get to the smelter right now, or
it's beyond the crossbeams?

2855
03:43:38,523 --> 03:43:42,256
MATT: The smelter is on the other of the room,
behind the staircase.

2856
03:43:42,256 --> 03:43:44,595
LAURA: All the shit we need?

2857
03:43:44,595 --> 03:43:45,844
MATT: Yeah.

2858
03:43:45,844 --> 03:43:47,780
LIAM: 24.

2859
03:43:47,780 --> 03:43:51,958
MATT: 24. You approach, and look up into the
warrior, and you can see the three of them are all

2860
03:43:51,958 --> 03:43:58,717
in the same stance. They're all standing square.
They all are clutching a long greatsword in one

2861
03:43:58,717 --> 03:44:03,919
hand. The other appears to be open to either
receive something or hold aloft something that's

2862
03:44:03,919 --> 03:44:06,346
not there, and they're all facing forward.

2863
03:44:06,346 --> 03:44:09,166
LIAM: I'm shooting my wings out as I walk up to
them, as well.

2864
03:44:09,166 --> 03:44:14,348
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) Your wings arc outward.
Looking ahead, you can see the armored helmet that

2865
03:44:14,348 --> 03:44:18,673
adorns its head that normally would pincer to
where the nose is, and you can see the pores of

2866
03:44:18,673 --> 03:44:26,978
the face. The helmet is one, big, domed curve on
top, and where a face would be, there is no face.

2867
03:44:26,978 --> 03:44:34,716
There's the outside of the head and a similar
triangle gap in the face that's smaller than the

2868
03:44:34,716 --> 03:44:39,067
one in the relief. You glance over quickly into
the other warrior, and the third, and all three of

2869
03:44:39,067 --> 03:44:45,182
them are faceless, instead having an empty
triangle that disappears into the face.

2870
03:44:45,182 --> 03:44:46,955
LIAM: It goes inward like the big one.

2871
03:44:46,955 --> 03:44:48,404
MATT: Yes. But they're smaller.

2872
03:44:48,404 --> 03:44:56,378
MARISHA: While he does that, I stand in the
middle. Are the three warriors triangulated, if

2873
03:44:56,378 --> 03:44:59,658
you were to draw out a triangle between them?

2874
03:44:59,658 --> 03:45:02,290
MATT: In the hexagonal room, yes, they would be.

2875
03:45:02,290 --> 03:45:03,823
MARISHA: In the same shape?

2876
03:45:03,823 --> 03:45:08,678
MATT: It seems to be. Close enough, at least,
based on the construction of the chamber.

2877
03:45:08,678 --> 03:45:15,284
TRAVIS: What did the reliefs have in their hands?
Weapons? Swords? Axes? Hammers?

2878
03:45:15,284 --> 03:45:17,990
MATT: No, they're all greatswords, but they're
also part of the relief embedded in the wall.

2879
03:45:17,990 --> 03:45:19,406
TRAVIS: Okay.

2880
03:45:19,406 --> 03:45:20,683
MARISHA: And one open hand.

2881
03:45:20,683 --> 03:45:26,805
MATT: One open hand. It's embedded in the wall,
and the other one is open to the side. But the relief is

2882
03:45:26,805 --> 03:45:33,467
all embedded in the wall, and you can see the 
triangular opening. The only thing that darts

2883
03:45:33,467 --> 03:45:36,625
inward is that vacuous shape in the face.

2884
03:45:36,625 --> 03:45:40,667
LAURA: This is where Vox Machina dies because they
can't figure out--

2885
03:45:40,667 --> 03:45:42,537
TALIESIN: We can't figure out how the triangle
works.

2886
03:45:42,537 --> 03:45:47,870
MARISHA: Is there anything on the floor? Any
patterns on the floor?

2887
03:45:47,870 --> 03:45:49,458
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2888
03:45:49,458 --> 03:45:52,853
SAM: The smelter, is it active right now? Is it
hot?

2889
03:45:52,853 --> 03:45:55,137
TRAVIS: Yeah, the coals are cooking.

2890
03:45:55,137 --> 03:45:58,936
MATT: The smelter is low, but it's burning.

2891
03:45:58,936 --> 03:46:01,433
SAM: What if we have to make something
triangular?

2892
03:46:01,433 --> 03:46:03,206
LAURA: Yeah, to fit in those things.

2893
03:46:03,206 --> 03:46:05,470
MARISHA: 13.

2894
03:46:05,470 --> 03:46:11,233
MATT: 13? Doesn't appear to be. The floor is
pretty solid. There's no real detail that catches

2895
03:46:11,233 --> 03:46:12,313
your attention.

2896
03:46:12,313 --> 03:46:13,665
TALIESIN: Let's start smelting.

2897
03:46:13,665 --> 03:46:15,107
LAURA: Yeah. Might as well.

2898
03:46:15,107 --> 03:46:22,087
SAM: What if we take those beans and put them in
the little triangle holes? I don't know. In their

2899
03:46:22,087 --> 03:46:22,931
hands?

2900
03:46:22,931 --> 03:46:29,268
MATT: Well, the statues are in the wall and you
can see the outer shape, barely protruding from

2901
03:46:29,268 --> 03:46:31,528
the wall, so it would be hard to place something
in the hand.

2902
03:46:31,528 --> 03:46:37,017
LAURA: Yeah, we switched all our gold for platinum
in Vasselheim.

2903
03:46:37,017 --> 03:46:39,832
TALIESIN: Yeah, so let's start the smelter, at the
very least.

2904
03:46:39,832 --> 03:46:45,782
MATT: Okay. The bellows are there. The big old
heavy bellows, and Grog, you know exactly what to

2905
03:46:45,782 --> 03:46:50,354
do. It's a really strange phenomenon to be like,
"I've never done this," but it's second nature,

2906
03:46:50,354 --> 03:46:56,504
and you begin to get that forge to well and burn,
and brightly. You can see the flames and the coals

2907
03:46:56,504 --> 03:47:04,788
heat up from dull red to a bright orange to a
white at times, and as it heats up, you have the

2908
03:47:04,788 --> 03:47:10,001
tongs. What do you smelt in?

2909
03:47:10,001 --> 03:47:14,166
MARISHA: But what to smelt in?

2910
03:47:14,166 --> 03:47:16,965
TRAVIS: I'm going to walk across.

2911
03:47:16,965 --> 03:47:24,426
MATT: You get the sense here that smelting is the
heating and liquefying of metals: one, to remove

2912
03:47:24,426 --> 03:47:28,424
impurities, and two, to then pour into a mold in
which, when it cools, the metal makes the shape of

2913
03:47:28,424 --> 03:47:29,655
whatever the mold is.

2914
03:47:29,655 --> 03:47:33,391
LAURA: Can I fly up to the circle on the wall, on
the crossbeams? Does it come off?

2915
03:47:33,391 --> 03:47:43,669
MATT: You reach out and you touch the gold relief.
It's built into the wall. It's a smooth, shiny,

2916
03:47:43,669 --> 03:47:46,161
polished gold, but it's not moving at all.

2917
03:47:46,161 --> 03:47:49,944
LAURA: We can't find anything that makes a
triangle shape, a pyramid shape, in the room?

2918
03:47:49,944 --> 03:47:56,818
TALIESIN: The faces of the statuary. Maybe we
should prod them. We might as well start prodding

2919
03:47:56,818 --> 03:48:01,289
things, because nothing's going to happen if we
don't prod them. I'm going to crawl up to one of

2920
03:48:01,289 --> 03:48:08,577
the statuary soldiers and see if the helmet comes
off, or if the face is removable. I'm going to

2921
03:48:08,577 --> 03:48:09,693
start tinkering.

2922
03:48:09,693 --> 03:48:13,396
MATT: You reach up and grab the side and feel the
side of the face and reach into the inside of the

2923
03:48:13,396 --> 03:48:17,180
gap in the triangular void, if you will.

2924
03:48:17,180 --> 03:48:18,834
TALIESIN: That thing is going to go click, isn't
it?

2925
03:48:18,834 --> 03:48:23,066
MATT: No, your fingers slide in. It does come to a
vanishing point. It comes to a point like the

2926
03:48:23,066 --> 03:48:28,196
larger relief. Once you look inside and get a
glance with the little bit of light that's in

2927
03:48:28,196 --> 03:48:33,784
there, the shape on the inside of it is different.
It's imperfect and messed up. It's hard to see

2928
03:48:33,784 --> 03:48:40,828
what it is, but it's not a perfect triangle like
the rest. Also, immediately, you guys see there's

2929
03:48:40,828 --> 03:48:47,428
a flash of orange light that completely surrounds
the exterior of the warrior, and the two other

2930
03:48:47,428 --> 03:48:54,128
warriors, their entire outer line glows a bright
orange, and with that, you instinctually step

2931
03:48:54,128 --> 03:48:55,104
back--

2932
03:48:55,104 --> 03:48:56,069
TALIESIN: I step up.

2933
03:48:56,069 --> 03:49:00,339
MATT: Or yeah, step up, as all three of them
(heavy movement) step out of the wall. Unlike the

2934
03:49:00,339 --> 03:49:04,770
ones you saw previously that were pressed in and
relief, these have a little more dimension to

2935
03:49:04,770 --> 03:49:09,770
them, and the majority of their physical form was
embedded backwards into the wall. They all of a

2936
03:49:09,770 --> 03:49:14,999
sudden come storming outward, giant greatswords
swinging in front of them, as they all

2937
03:49:14,999 --> 03:49:20,401
immediately, the heads creepily with the open,
triangular void of where a face would be spin to

2938
03:49:20,401 --> 03:49:22,512
one of the nearby individuals in their space.

2939
03:49:22,512 --> 03:49:26,277
LAURA: Ooh, maybe we have to kill them and then
smelt into their faces.

2940
03:49:26,277 --> 03:49:28,602
TALIESIN: I'm into it. I like this plan.

2941
03:49:28,602 --> 03:49:30,237
MARISHA: Don't destroy their faces!

2942
03:49:30,237 --> 03:49:33,896
MATT: That's where we'll pick up next week,
because it is almost 11:00.

2943
03:49:33,896 --> 03:49:42,694
LAURA: All right. How tall are they? How big were
they?

2944
03:49:42,694 --> 03:49:45,266
MATT: They're about ten to 12 feet tall?

2945
03:49:45,266 --> 03:49:47,167
LAURA: And they're made out of metal?

2946
03:49:47,167 --> 03:49:50,685
MATT: They're made out of the same metal material,
it looks like, that the walls are.

2947
03:49:50,685 --> 03:49:51,685
LAURA: They're golems.

2948
03:49:51,685 --> 03:49:55,171
MATT: Constructs of some kind.

2949
03:49:55,171 --> 03:49:59,680
TRAVIS: Those crossbeams, do they look like
they're structurally integral to the room?

2950
03:49:59,680 --> 03:50:08,071
MATT: No. They're bolted against the far wall, and
it looks more ornamental, or at least there are

2951
03:50:08,071 --> 03:50:11,665
seams against that back wall to hold a relief
there or at least that's where the relief is

2952
03:50:11,665 --> 03:50:16,669
placed. You get the sense with more inspection,
you'd get a better feel, but it doesn't look like,

2953
03:50:16,669 --> 03:50:23,430
immediately at glance, it's integral to the
design. So! We'll pick up right at the beginning

2954
03:50:23,430 --> 03:50:28,682
of those large, metallic creatures emerging from
the walls and the ensuing conflict next week. In

2955
03:50:28,682 --> 03:50:34,501
the meantime, thank you guys so much for joining
us on the next crazy step of our adventure.

2956
03:50:34,501 --> 03:50:36,619
MARISHA: Happy birthday!

2957
03:50:36,619 --> 03:50:39,723
MATT: Happy birthday, yeah.

2958
03:50:39,723 --> 03:50:43,447
LAURA: It's still for another hour! Thank you,
Magic: the Gathering - Puzzle Quest.

2959
03:50:43,447 --> 03:50:46,677
MATT: Yes, thank you Puzzle Quest, Magic: the
Gathering edition for being our fantastic sponsor.

2960
03:50:46,677 --> 03:50:51,315
Thank you guys for watching. We'll pick up next
week, and then after that is GenCon.

2961
03:50:51,315 --> 03:50:53,097
LAURA: (laughs) Oh jeez.

2962
03:50:53,097 --> 03:50:57,651
MATT: So after next week is GenCon, so start
getting that ready.

2963
03:50:57,651 --> 03:51:00,804
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh my god, we're going right into
it.

2964
03:51:00,804 --> 03:51:08,344
MATT: Yep. (laughs) Two weeks. All right. Have a
good night, guys, rest well, thank you for coming,

2965
03:51:08,344 --> 03:51:09,273
and as always--

2966
03:51:09,273 --> 03:51:10,577
LAURA: I'll most likely kill you in the morning.

2967
03:51:10,577 --> 03:51:12,333
MATT: Is it Thursday yet? Good night.

2968
03:51:12,441 --> 03:57:25,993
